In other words, for a deterministic machine \\(T\\) to either accept or reject an input \\(x\\), it is both necessary and sufficient that there exist a single halting computation \\(C_0(x),\\ldots,C_n(x)\\). The output of the machine is then determined by whether \\(C_n(x)\\) is an accepting or rejecting configuration. A consequence of this is that complexity classes like \\(\\textbf{P}\\) which are defined in terms of this model are closed under complementation \u2013 i.e. for all languages \\(X \\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^*\\), \\(X\\) is in \\(\\textbf{P}\\) if and only if its complement \\(\\overline{X} =_{df} \\{x \\in \\{0,1\\}^* : x \\not\\in X\\}\\) is also in \\(\\textbf{P}\\).[22] If we define the class \\(\\textbf{coC}\\) to consist of those problems whose complements are in the class \\(\\textbf{C}\\), it thus follows that \\(\\textbf{P} = \\textbf{coP}\\).\nIn contrast to this, there is no a priori guarantee that classes such as \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) defined in terms of non-deterministic models are closed under complementation. For consider a problem such as \\(\\sc{SAT}\\) belonging to this class. \\(\\overline{\\sc{SAT}}\\) \u2013 i.e. the complement of \\(\\sc{SAT}\\)\u2013 consists of the set of formulas for which there does not exist a satisfying valuation \u2013 i.e. the contradictory formulas of propositional logic. From this it follows that \\(\\phi \\in \\overline{\\sc{SAT}}\\) if and only if \\(\\neg \\phi \\in \\sc{VALID}\\) \u2013 i.e. the set of valid propositional formulas. As this observation provides an easy polynomial time reduction of \\(\\overline{\\sc{SAT}}\\) to \\(\\sc{VALID}\\), the latter is thus not only a member of \\(\\textbf{coNP}\\), but is also complete for this class.[23]\nNote, however, that in order to show that \\(\\phi \\in \\sc{VALID}\\) requires that we show that \\(\\phi\\) is true with respect to all valuations.  As there exist \\(2^n\\) valuations for a formula containing \\(n \\) propositional variables, it is by no means evident that the membership of an arbitrary formula in \\(\\sc{VALID}\\) can be decided in polynomial time by an algorithm which can be implemented as a non-deterministic Turing machine relative to the acceptance and rejection conventions describe above. In fact, the following is another fundamental unresolved question in contemporary complexity theory:\nOpen Question 2 \nAre the classes \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) and \\(\\textbf{coNP}\\) distinct?\nIt is widely believed that like Open Question 1, Open Question 2 has an affirmative answer. But observe that if any \\(\\textbf{NP}\\)-complete problem could be shown to be in \\(\\textbf{coNP}\\), it would also follow that \\(\\textbf{NP}  = \\textbf{coNP}\\).[24] This in turn suggests that problems which are known to be in the class \\(\\textbf{NP} \\cap \\textbf{coNP}\\) are unlikely to be \\(\\textbf{NP}\\)-complete (and by symmetric considerations, also unlikely to be \\(\\textbf{coNP}\\)-complete). This class consists of those problems \\(X\\) which possess polynomial sized certificates for demonstrating both membership and \nnon-membership.\n\nIt is easy to see that \\(\\textbf{NP} \\cap \\textbf{coNP}\\) includes all problems in \\(\\textbf{P}\\). But this class also contains some problems which are not currently known to be feasibly decidable. An important example is \\(\\sc{FACTORIZATION}\\) (as defined in  Section 1.1).   For on the one hand, a number \\(1 \\lt d \\leq m\\) which divides \\(n\\) serves as a certificate for the membership of \\(\\langle n,m \\rangle\\) in \\(\\sc{FACTORIZATION}\\). And on the other hand, in order to demonstrate the membership of \\(\\langle n,m \\rangle\\) in \\(\\overline{\\sc{FACTORIZATION}}\\), it suffices to exhibit a prime factorization of \\(n\\) in which no factor is less than \\(m\\). This follows because prime factorizations are unique (unlike, e.g., falsifying valuations in the case of \\(\\sc{VALIDITY}\\)) and because the primality of the individual factors can be verified in polynomial time by the AKS algorithm. Hence \\(\\sc{FACTORIZATION}\\) is in \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) and \\(\\textbf{coNP}\\) simultaneously.\nAs with other computational problems of practical importance, considerable effort has been put into finding an efficient algorithm for \\(\\sc{FACTORIZATION}\\). If our inability to find an efficient factorization algorithm is indeed indicative that this problem is not in \\(\\textbf{P}\\), then a positive answer to Open Question 2 would entail that there are natural mathematical problems which are not feasibly decidable but which are also not \\(\\textbf{NP}\\)-complete. This in turn suggests that the degree structure of problems lying between \\(\\textbf{P}\\) and \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) (presuming this class is non-empty) may provide a yet finer grained analysis of intrinsic computational difficulty than is provided by the Cobham-Edmonds Thesis alone.[25]\n3.4.2 The Polynomial Hierarchy, polynomial space, and exponential time\nIf initial attempts to find an efficient algorithm for solving a problem \\(X\\) which is known to be decidable are unsuccessful, a common strategy is to attempt to show that \\(X\\) is \\(\\textbf{NP}\\)-complete. For assuming \\(\\textbf{P} \\subsetneq \\textbf{NP}\\), it then follows from the Cobham-Edmonds thesis that no feasible algorithm for solving \\(X\\) can exist.\nNonetheless, fields which make use of discrete mathematics often give rise to decidable problems which are thought to be considerably more difficult than \\(\\textbf{NP}\\)-complete ones. For recall that it is a consequence of Theorem 3.1 that the classes \\(\\textbf{EXP}\\) and \\(\\textbf{NEXP}\\) (i.e. exponential time and non-deterministic exponential time) both properly extend \\(\\textbf{P}\\). Hence problems complete for these classes can currently be classified as infeasible regardless of how Open Question 1 is resolved. Such problems include several sub-cases of the decision problem for first-order logic (which will be considered in \n Section 4.2) \n as well as versions of some of the game-theoretic problems considered in this section.[26]\nA complexity class which is likely to be properly contained in \\(\\textbf{EXP}\\) but which still contains many apparently infeasible problems which arise in computational practice is \\(\\textbf{PSPACE}\\). A prototypical example of a problem in \\(\\textbf{PSPACE}\\) can be formulated using the notion of a quantified boolean formula [QBF] \u2013 i.e. a statement of the form \\(Q_1 x_i \\ldots Q_n x_n\\psi\\) where \\(Q_i = \\exists\\) or \\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\psi\\) is a formula of propositional logic containing the propositional variables \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\) which are treated as bound by these quantifiers. A QBF-formula is said to be true if when \\(Q_i x_i\\) is interpreted as an existential or universal quantifier over the truth value which is assigned to \\(x_i\\), \\(\\psi\\) is true with respect to all of the valuations determined by the relevant quantifier prefix \u2013 e.g. \\(\\forall x_1 \\exists x_2 (x_1 \\vee x_2)\\) is a true quantified boolean formula, while \\(\\forall x_1 \\exists x_2 \\forall x_3 ((x_1 \\vee x_2) \\wedge x_3)\\) is not. We may now define the problem\n\\(\\sc{TQBF}\\ \\)\nGiven a quantified boolean formula \\(\\phi\\), is \\(\\phi\\) true?\nStockmeyer and Meyer (1973) showed the following:\n\nTheorem 3.5  \\(\\sc{TQBF}\\) is \\(\\textbf{PSPACE}\\)-complete.[27]\nThis result suggests that there is a close connection between problems which can be decided using unbounded time but a feasible amount of memory space and those which could be solved if we were able to answer certain kinds of existential or universal queries in a single step using a bounded number of alternations between the two kinds of queries. This observation can be used to give an alternative characterization of several of the complexity classes we have considered. Recall, for instance, that \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) can be informally characterized as the set of problems \\(X\\) for which membership can be established by providing a certificate of the appropriate sort \u2013 e.g. \\(\\phi \\in \\sc{SAT}\\) can be established by exhibiting a satisfying valuation. Similarly, \\(\\textbf{coNP}\\) can be similarly characterized as the set of problems for which non-membership can be established by the existence of such a certificate \u2013 e.g. \\(\\phi\\ \\not\\in \\sc{VALID}\\) can also be established by exhibiting a satisfying valuation.\nOn the basis of these observations, it is not difficult to prove the following:\n\nProposition 3.1   Call a relation \\(R(x,y)\\) polynomial decidable if \\(\\{\\langle x,y \\rangle \\mid R(x,y) \\} \\in \\textbf{P}\\).\n\n\nA problem \\(X\\) is in \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) just in case there exists a polynomial decidable relation \\(R(x,y)\\) and a polynomial \\(p(x)\\) such that \\(x \\in X\\) if and only if \\(\\exists y \\leq p(\\lvert x\\rvert) R(x,y)\\).\n\nA problem \\(X\\) is in \\(\\textbf{coNP}\\) just in case there exists a polynomial decidable relation \\(R(x,y)\\) and a polynomial \\(p(x)\\) such that \\(x \\in X\\) if and only if \\(\\forall y \\leq p(\\lvert x\\rvert) R(x,y)\\).\n\n\nProposition 3.1 provides the basis for defining a hierarchy of complexity classes \u2013 i.e. the so-called Polynomial Hierarchy [\\(\\textbf{PH}\\)] \u2013 based on the logical representation of computational problems.  We first define \\(\\Delta^P_0, \\Sigma^P_0\\) and \\(\\Pi^P_0\\) to be alternative names for the class \\(\\textbf{P}\\) \u2013 i.e. \\(\\Delta^P_0 = \\Sigma^P_0 = \\Pi^P_0 = \\textbf{P}\\). We then define \\(\\Sigma^P_{n+1}\\) to be the class of problems of the form \\(X = \\{x \\mid \\exists y \\leq p(\\lvert x\\rvert) R(x,y)\\}\\) where \\(R(x,y) \\in \\Pi^P_{n}\\) and \\(\\Pi^P_{n+1}\\) to be the class of problems of the form \\(X = \\{x \\mid \\forall y \\leq q(\\lvert x\\rvert) S(x,y)\\}\\) where \\(S(x,y) \\in \\Sigma^P_{n}\\) and \\(p(n)\\) and \\(q(n)\\) are both polynomials. \\(\\Delta^P_n\\) is the set of problems which are in both \\(\\Sigma^P_{n}\\) and \\(\\Pi^P_{n}\\). Finally, the class \\(\\textbf{PH}\\) is then defined as \\(\\bigcup_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\Sigma^P_k\\).[28]\nIt follows immediately from Proposition 3.1 that \\(\\Sigma^P_1 = \\textbf{NP}\\) and \\(\\Pi^P_1 = \\textbf{coNP}\\). It is also evident from the foregoing definitions that we have the containment relations \\(\\Sigma^P_n \\subseteq \\Delta^P_{n+1} \\subseteq \\Sigma^P_{n+1}\\) and \\(\\Pi^P_n \\subseteq \\Delta^P_{n+1} \\subseteq \\Pi^P_{n+1}\\) depicted in Figure 4. It is also not difficult to show that \\(\\textbf{PH} \\subseteq \\textbf{PSPACE}\\). These relationships are similar to those which obtain between the analogously defined \\(\\Sigma^0_n\\)- and \\(\\Pi^0_n\\)-sets in the Arithmetic Hierarchy studied in computability theory (see, e.g., Rogers 1987). But whereas it can be shown by a standard diagonal argument that the arithmetic hierarchy does not collapse, the following are also currently unresolved questions of fundamental importance:\n\nOpen Question 3\n\n\nIs \\(\\textbf{PH}\\) a proper hierarchy \u2013 i.e. is it the case that for all \\(k\\), \\(\\Sigma^P_{k} \\subsetneq \\Sigma^P_{k+1}\\) and \\(\\Sigma^P_{k} \\neq \\Pi^P_{k}\\)?\n\nIs \\(\\textbf{PH}\\) properly contained in \\(\\textbf{PSPACE}\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. The Polynomial Hierarchy.\n\nTo better understand why Open Questions 3a,b) are also expected to be decided positively, it will be useful to further explore the relationship between \\(\\textbf{PSPACE}\\) and the characterization of \\(\\textbf{PH}\\) in terms of quantifier alternations. To this end, we first show that the problem \\(\\sc{TQBF}\\) may be redefined in terms of a game between a player called Verifier\u2013 who can be thought of as attempting to demonstrate that a QBF-formula \\(\\phi\\) is true \u2013 and another player called Falsifier\u2013 who can be thought of as attempting to demonstrate that \\(\\phi\\) is not true.[29] Supposing that \\(\\phi\\) is of the form \\(\\exists x_1 \\forall x_2 \\ldots Q_n \\psi\\), a play of the verification game for \\(\\phi\\) is defined as follows:\n\n\n\u2022\nIn the first round, Verifier moves by selecting a value for \\(v(x_1)\\).\n\n\n\u2022\nIn the second round, Falsifier moves by selecting a value for \\(v(x_2)\\).\n\n\n\n\\(\\quad\\vdots\\)\n\n\n\u2022\n In the \\(n\\)th round,  either  Verifier or Falsifier selects a value of \\(v(x_n)\\), depending on whether \\(Q_n = \\exists\\) or \\(\\forall\\).\n\n\n\u2022\nIf \\(\\llbracket \\phi \\rrbracket_v = 1\\) then Verifier is the winner and if \\(\\llbracket \\phi \\rrbracket_v = 0\\) then Falsifier is the winner.\n\n\nA winning strategy for Verifier in the verification game for \\(\\phi\\) is a sequence of moves and countermoves for all possible replies and counter-replies of Falsifier which is guaranteed to result in a win for Verifier. Let us call the problem of deciding whether Verifier has such a winning strategy for \\(\\phi\\) \\(\\sc{TWO}\\ \\sc{PLAYER}\\ \\sc{SAT}\\). As the moves of the two players mirror the interpretations of \\(\\exists\\) and \\(\\forall\\) for QBF formulas, it is not difficult to see that \\(\\phi \\in \\sc{TWO}\\ \\sc{PLAYER}\\ \\sc{SAT}\\) just in case \\(\\phi \\in \\sc{TQBF}\\). And for any QBF-formula \\(\\phi\\) with \\(n\\) initial quantifiers we may efficiently construct an equivalent formula with at most \\(2n\\) quantifiers in the required alternating form by interspersing dummy quantifiers as needed. It thus follows that like \\(\\sc{TQBF}\\), \\(\\sc{TWO}\\ \\sc{PLAYER}\\ \\sc{SAT}\\) is also \\(\\textbf{PSPACE}\\)-complete.\nAlthough \\(\\sc{TWO}\\ \\sc{PLAYER}\\ \\sc{SAT}\\) is defined in terms of a very simple game, similar results can be obtained for suitable variations of a variety of well familiar board games. Consider, for instance the following variation on the standard rules of Go: (i) the game is played on an \\(n \\times n\\) board; (ii) the winner of the game is the player with the most stones at the end of \\(n^2\\) rounds.   Lichtenstein and Sipser (1980) demonstrated the \\(\\textbf{PSPACE}\\)-completeness of the following problem:\n\\(\\sc{GO}\\ \\)\nGiven a board position in an \\(n \\times n\\) game of Go, does there exist a winning strategy for black (i.e. the player who moves first)?\nSubject to similar modification to the end game rules, analogous results have also been obtained for chess (Fraenkel and Lichtenstein 1981) and checkers (Robson 1984).[30]\nWhat these games have in common is that the definition of a winning strategy for the player who moves first involves the alternation of existential and universal quantifiers in a manner which mimics the definition of the classes \\(\\Sigma^P_n\\) and \\(\\Pi^P_n\\) which comprise \\(\\textbf{PH}\\). Taking this into account, suppose we define \\(\\sc{TWO}\\ \\sc{PLAYER}\\ \\sc{SAT}_n\\) to be the variant of \\(\\sc{TWO}\\ \\sc{PLAYER}\\ \\sc{SAT}\\) wherein there are at most \\(n\\) alternations of quantifiers in \\(\\phi\\) (it thus follows that all of the games for formulas in this class will be of at most \\(n\\) rounds). \\(\\sc{TWO}\\ \\sc{PLAYER}\\ \\sc{SAT}_n\\) may be shown to be complete for the class \\(\\Sigma^P_n\\) in the Polynomial Hierarchy. Note, however, as the value of \\(n\\) increases, we expect that it should become more difficult to decide membership in \\(\\sc{TWO}\\ \\sc{PLAYER}\\ \\sc{SAT}_n\\) in much the same way that it appears to become more difficult to determine whether a given player has a winning strategy for increasingly long games of Go or chess.\nThis observation provides part of the reason why it is currently expected that the answer to Open Question 3a is positive. For as we can now see, the assertion \\(\\textbf{PH} = \\Sigma^P_k\\) for some \\(k\\) is equivalent to the assertion that the problem of determining whether Verifier has a winning strategy for \\(n\\)-round verification games is no harder than that of deciding this question for \\(k\\)-round games for all \\(n \\geq k\\). A related observation bears on the status of Open Question 3b. For note that if \\(\\textbf{PH} = \\textbf{PSPACE}\\), then \\(\\sc{TWO}\\ \\sc{PLAYER}\\ \\sc{SAT}\\) would be complete for \\(\\textbf{PH}\\) (as it is for \\(\\textbf{PSPACE}\\)). Since \\(\\textbf{PH}\\) is defined as \\(\\bigcup_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\Sigma^P_k\\), it would then follow that \\(\\sc{TWO}\\ \\sc{PLAYER}\\ \\sc{SAT} \\in \\Sigma^P_k\\) for some \\(k\\). But in this case, we would again have that the problem of determining whether Verifier has a winning strategy for \\(n\\)-round verification games would be no harder than that of deciding this question for \\(k\\)-round games for all \\(n \\geq k\\). As this again runs contrary to expectation, it is also widely believed not only that \\(\\textbf{PH} \\subsetneq \\textbf{PSPACE}\\) but also that the former class differs from the latter in failing to have complete problems.\n3.4.3 Parallel, probabilistic, and quantum complexity\nEven taking into account our current inability to resolve Open Questions 1\u20133, the hierarchy of complexity classes depicted in Figure 2 ranging from \\(\\textbf{P}\\) to \\(\\textbf{EXP}\\) represent the most robust benchmarks of computational difficulty now available. Beyond this hierarchy a wide array of additional classes are also studied which are believed to demarcate additional structure either inside \\(\\textbf{P}\\) or between \\(\\textbf{P}\\) and \\(\\textbf{NP}\\). Comprehensive consideration of the diversity of these classes is beyond the scope of the current survey. But to complement our understanding of classes defined relative to \\(\\mathfrak{T}\\) and \\(\\mathfrak{N}\\), it will be useful to consider three additional classes \u2013 \\(\\textbf{NC}\\), \\(\\textbf{BPP}\\), and \\(\\textbf{BQP}\\) \u2013 which are defined relative to other models of computation.\nOne way of defining \\(\\textbf{NC}\\) is in terms of a model of computation \\(\\mathfrak{P}\\) known as the Parallel RAM (or PRAM) machine. This model is a variant of the conventional RAM model described in  Section 2.2 which allows for parallelism. A PRAM machine \\(P\\) consists of a sequence of programs \\(\\Pi_1,\\ldots,\\Pi_{q(n)}\\), each comprised by a finite sequence of instructions for performing operations on registers as before. Each program also controls a separate processor with its own program counter and accumulator. The processors operate in parallel and can write to a common block of registers, adopting some policy for resolving with conflicts. Finally, the number of programs (and hence processors) comprising \\(P\\) is not fixed, but can vary with the size of the input \\(n\\) according to the function \\(q(n)\\). In this way, a PRAM machine can recruit more processors to operate on larger inputs, although the number of processors employed must be fixed uniformly in the size of the input.\nAlthough the PRAM model is deterministic, it is easy to see that its members can be used to efficiently simulate the operation of a non-deterministic Turing machine \\(N\\) by recruiting sufficiently many processors to carry out all paths in a given computation tree for \\(N\\) in parallel. This model is hence a member of van Emde Boas\u2019s (1990) second machine class and as such is not considered to be a reasonable model of computation. Nonetheless, \\(\\mathfrak{P}\\) is a useful theoretical model in that it provides a formal medium for implementing procedures which call for certain operations to be carried out simultaneously in parallel.\nIt has long been known that certain problems \u2013 e.g. matrix multiplication, graph reachability, and sorting \u2013 admit parallel algorithms which in some cases are faster than the most efficient known sequential ones (see, e.g., Papadimitriou 1994). But this observation would still be of little practical significance if the algorithms in question achieved such speed up only at the cost of having to employ exponentially many processors relative to the size of their inputs. For in this case it seems that we would have little hope of building a computing device on which they could be concretely implemented.\nIt is notable, however, that the parallel algorithms for the problems just mentioned only require a number of processors which is polynomial in size of their input \\(n\\) and also only require time polylogarithmic in \\(n\\) (i.e. \\(O(\\log^k(n))\\) for fixed \\(k\\)). This motivates the definition of \\(\\textbf{NC}\\) as the class of problems which can be solved by a PRAM machine in time \\(O(\\log^c(n))\\) using \\(O(n^k)\\) processors (for fixed \\(c,k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\)).[31] In particular, the amount of work (defined as the sum of the number of steps required by each processor) performed by a machine satisfying this definition will be polynomial in the size of its input.\nWe have seen that the Cobham-Edmond\u2019s Thesis suggests that \\(\\textbf{P}\\) coincides with the class of problems which can be feasibly decided by algorithms implementable relative to a sequential model of computation such as \\(\\mathfrak{T}\\). In much the same way, it is often suggested that \\(\\textbf{NC}\\) coincides with the class of problems which can be feasibly decided by algorithms which can be implemented relative to a parallel model such as \\(\\mathfrak{P}\\) (see, e.g. Greenlaw, Hoover, and Ruzzo 1995). In particular, it can be shown that any PRAM machine which runs in time \\(O(\\log^c(n))\\) using \\(O(n^k)\\) processors can be simulated by a polynomial time sequential machine. From this, it follows that \\(\\textbf{NC}\\) is a subset of \\(\\textbf{P}\\).\n\\(\\textbf{NC}\\) is of interest in part because the opposite inclusion is not known to hold \u2013 i.e. the following question is also open:\nOpen Question 4  Is \\(\\textbf{NC}\\) properly contained in \\(\\textbf{P}\\)?\nThe current consensus is that like Open Questions 1\u20133, Open Question 4 will also be answered in the positive. In this case, the heuristic argument derives from the observation that if \\(\\textbf{NC} = \\textbf{P}\\), then it would be the case that every problem \\(X\\) possessing a \\(O(n^j)\\) sequential algorithm could be \u2018sped up\u2019 in the sense of admitting a parallel algorithm which requires only time \\(O(\\log^c(n))\\) using \\(O(n^{k})\\) processors. Even allowing for the case where \\(k\\) is substantially larger than \\(j\\), this is thought to be unlikely in virtue of the fact that certain problems in \\(\\textbf{P}\\) appear to be \u2018inherently sequential\u2019 in the sense of exhibiting structure which makes them resistant to parallelization. In particular, this is conjectured to be true of \\(\\textbf{P}\\)-complete problems such as determining whether a boolean circuit evaluates to true, or if a formula in the Horn fragment of propositional logic is satisfiable.[32]\nAnother active area of research in complexity theory concerns classes defined in terms of probabilistic models of computation. Instances of such models are assumed to have access to some genuine source of randomness \u2013 e.g. a fair coin or a quantum mechanical random number generator \u2013 which can be used to determine the course of their computation. This basic idea has given rise to a number of different paradigms for modeling probabilistic computation, of which the original non-deterministic Turing machine model \\(\\mathfrak{N}\\) is an early exemplar. As we have seen, however, non-deterministic Turing machines cannot be employed as a practical model of probabilistic computation. For in order to use \\(N\\) to conclude that \\(x\\) is not a member of a given language \\(X\\) requires that we examine all of \\(N\\)\u2019s potential computations on this input (which is generally infeasible to do).\nIt is thus also reasonable to ask how we might modify the definition of \\(\\mathfrak{N}\\) so as to obtain a characterization of probabilistic algorithms which we might usefully employ. One answer is embodied in the definition of the class \\(\\textbf{BPP}\\), or bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time.[33] This class can be most readily defined relative to a model of computation known as the probabilistic Turing machine \\(\\mathfrak{C}\\). Such a device \\(C\\) has access to a random number generator which produces a new bit at each step in its computation but is otherwise like a conventional Turing machine. The action taken by \\(C\\) at the next step is then determined by the value of this bit, in addition to its internal state and the currently scanned symbol.\n\\(\\textbf{BPP}\\) can now be defined to include the problems \\(X\\) such that there exists a probabilistic Turing machine \\(C \\in \\mathfrak{C}\\) and a constant \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\lt p \\leq 1\\) with the following properties:\n\n\n\\(C\\) runs in polynomial time for all inputs;\n\nfor all inputs \\(x \\in X\\), at least fraction \\(p\\) of the possible computations of \\(C\\) on \\(x\\) accept;\n\nfor all inputs \\(x \\not\\in X\\), at least fraction \\(p\\) of the possible computations of \\(C\\) on \\(x\\) reject.\n\nThis definition seeks to formalize the intuitive characterization of a problems decidable by a probabilistic algorithm as one for which there exists a decision procedure which can make undetermined choices during its computation but still solves the problem correctly in a \u2018clear majority\u2019 of cases (i.e. with probability \\(p\\) bounded away from \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)). It is not difficult to see that if we possessed an algorithm for deciding \\(X\\) which is implementable by a machine \\(C\\) satisfying (i)\u2013(iii), then we could correctly decide whether \\(x \\in X\\) with arbitrarily high probability by applying the algorithm repeatedly and checking whether the majority of its computations accepted or rejected.[34]\nAs the standard Turing machine model \\(\\mathfrak{T}\\) corresponds to a special case of \\(\\mathfrak{C}\\), it follows that \\(\\textbf{P} \\subseteq \\textbf{BPP}\\). For a long time, it was also thought that \\(\\sc{PRIMES}\\) might be an example of a problem which was in \\(\\textbf{BPP}\\) but not \\(\\textbf{P}\\).[35] However, we now know that this problem is in \\(\\textbf{P}\\) in virtue of the AKS primality algorithm. At present, not only are there few known candidates for separating these classes, but it is also not known if \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) is contained in \\(\\textbf{BPP}\\) (although the latter has been shown to be included in \\(\\Sigma^P_2 \\) by Lautemann (1983)). Thus although it might at first seem plausible that the ability to make random choices during the course of a computation allows us to practically solve certain problems which resist efficient deterministic algorithms, it is again an open problem whether this is true.\nA final complexity class which has attracted considerable attention in recent years is known as \\(\\textbf{BQP}\\) (or bounded error quantum polynomial time). \\(\\textbf{BQP}\\) is defined analogously to \\(\\textbf{BPP}\\) but using a model \\(\\mathfrak{Q}\\) of quantum computation instead of the model \\(\\mathfrak{C}\\).  Such a model can be roughly characterized as a device which makes use of quantum-mechanical phenomena  (such as entanglement or interference) to perform operations on data represented by sequences qubits \u2013 i.e. quantum superpositions of vectors of 0s and 1s. Based on early suggestions of Manin (1980) and Feynman (1982), a number of such models were proposed in the 1980s and 90s on which the precise definition of \\(\\textbf{BQP}\\) can be based \u2013 e.g. the Quantum Turing Machine of Deutsch (1985).\nSeveral algorithms have been discovered which can be implemented on such devices  which run faster than the best known classical algorithms for the same problem. Among these are Grover\u2019s algorithm (Grover 1996) for searching an unsorted database (which runs in time \\(O(n^{1/2})\\), whereas the best possible classical algorithm is \\(O(n)\\)) and Shor\u2019s algorithm (Shor 1999) for integer factorization (which runs in \\(O(\\log_2(n)^3)\\), whereas the best known classical algorithm is \\(O(2^{\\log_2(\\log_2(n))^{1/3})}\\)). Since it can be shown that quantum models can simulate models such as the classical Turing machine, \\(\\textbf{BQP}\\) contains \\(\\textbf{P}\\) and \\(\\textbf{BPP}\\). And as we have just seen, \\(\\textbf{BQP}\\) contains at least one problem \u2013 i.e. \\(\\sc{FACTORIZATION}\\) \u2013 which is not known to be contained in \\(\\textbf{P}\\).\nAlthough it can be shown that \\(\\textbf{BQP} \\subseteq \\textbf{PSPACE}\\), the relationship between the former class and \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) is currently not well understood. In particular, no polynomial time quantum algorithms have been discovered for solving \\(\\textbf{NP}\\)-complete problems which are implementable on the more widely accepted models of quantum computation. There is also considerable controversy as to whether it will prove possible to construct physical realizations of such models which are sufficiently robust to reliably solve instances of problems which cannot currently be solved using classical hardware.   Even if a proof of \\(\\textbf{P} \\subsetneq \\textbf{BQP}\\) were found, further empirical investigation would thus be required to determine the bearing of quantum computation on either the limits of feasible computation or on the status of the Cobham-Edmonds thesis itself. Nonetheless, quantum computation is a very active area of research at present.[36]\n4. Connections to logic and philosophy\nThere has to date been surprisingly little philosophical engagement with computational complexity theory.  Although several questions which have their origins in computability theory \u2013 e.g. the status of Church\u2019s Thesis and the significance of effectively undecidable problems \u2013 have been widely discussed, the analogous questions about the Cobham-Edmonds Thesis and the significance of effectively decidable but feasibly undecidable problems have attracted little attention amongst philosophers of mathematics. And despite ongoing interest in logical knowledge and resource bounded reasoning, fields such as epistemology, decision theory, and social choice theory have only recently begun to make use of complexity-theoretic concepts and results.  This section will attempt to bridge some of these gaps by highlighting connections between computational complexity and traditional topics in logic and philosophy.\n4.1 On the significance of \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\)?\nThe appreciation of complexity theory outside of theoretical computer science is largely due to the notoriety of open questions such as 1\u20134. Of these, Open Question 1 \u2013 henceforth \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}?\\) \u2013 has attracted the greatest attention. Along with long standing unresolved questions from pure and applied mathematics such as the Riemann Hypothesis and the Hodge Conjecture, it is the subject of a major prize competition \u2013 i.e. the Millennium Problems (Cook 2006). It is also frequently the focus of survey articles and popular expositions \u2013 e.g. (Sipser 1992), (Fortnow 2009), and (Fortnow 2013).\nThere are indeed several reasons to suspect that the resolution of \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}?\\) will prove to have far reaching practical and theoretical consequences outside of computer science. Perhaps the most significant of these revolves around the possibility that despite the various heuristic arguments which can currently be offered in favor of the hypothesis that \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\), there remains the possibility that \\(\\textbf{P} = \\textbf{NP}\\) is true after all. Recall that \\(\\textbf{P}\\) can be characterized as the class of problems membership in which can be decided efficiently, whereas \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) can be characterized as the class of problems for which membership can be verified efficiently once an appropriate certificate is provided. If it turned out that \\(\\textbf{P} = \\textbf{NP}\\), then the difficulty of these two tasks would coincide (up to a polynomial factor) for all problems in \\(\\textbf{NP}\\). Some consequences of this would be that the task of finding a satisfying valuation \\(v\\) for a propositional formula \\(\\phi\\) is no harder than constructing its truth table, the task of factoring a natural number would be no more difficult than verifying that a given factorization is correct, etc.\nOur intuitions strongly reflect the fact that the former problems in such pairs seem more difficult than the latter. But beyond collapsing distinctions currently appear almost self-evident, the coincidence of \\(\\textbf{P}\\) and \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) would also have a more radical effect on the situation which we currently face in mathematics. For suppose that \\(\\mathsf{T}\\) is a recursively axiomatic theory which is sufficiently strong to formalize our current mathematical theorizing \u2013 e.g. Zermelo Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice [\\(\\mathsf{ZFC}\\)], supplemented as needed with large cardinal hypotheses. Observe that regardless of the proof theoretic strength of \\(\\mathsf{T}\\), the following question about derivability in this theory will still presumably be decidable in polynomial time:\n\\(\\sc{PROOF}\\ \\sc{CHECKING}_{\\mathsf{T}}\\ \\) \nGiven a formula \\(\\phi\\) in the language of \\(\\mathsf{T}\\) and a finite object \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) of the appropriate sort (e.g. a derivation sequence or tree), is \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) a well-formed proof of \\(\\phi\\) from the axioms of \\(\\mathsf{T}\\)?[37]\nFor such standard definitions it will also be the case that for each \\(n\\), there will be of order \\(O(2^n)\\) \\(\\mathsf{T}\\)-derivations of length \\(n = \\lvert \\mathcal{D}\\rvert\\) (say measured in the number of symbols in \\(\\mathcal{D}\\)). We can thus non-deterministically check if \\(\\phi\\) is derivable by a proof of size \\(\\leq n\\) by guessing a sequence of symbols length \\(n\\) and then checking (in polynomial time) whether it is a well-formed proof of \\(\\phi\\). It thus follows that the following problem is in \\(\\textbf{NP}\\):\n\\(n\\text{-}\\sc{PROVABILITY}_{\\mathsf{T}}\\ \\)\nGiven a formula \\(\\phi\\) in the language of \\(\\mathsf{T}\\) and a natural number \\(n\\), does there exist a valid \\(\\mathsf{T}\\)-derivation \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) of length \\(\\leq n\\) such that \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is a valid proof of \\(\\phi\\)?\nWe are, of course, generally interested in the question of whether \\(\\phi\\) is provable in \\(\\mathsf{T}\\) without a restriction on the length of its derivation \u2013 e.g. in the case where \\(\\phi\\) expresses the Riemann Hypothesis and \\(\\mathsf{T}\\) is a theory like \\(\\textsf{ZFC}\\). But in a letter to von Neumann, G\u00f6del (1956) observed that if we were able to efficiently decide \\(n\\text{-}\\sc{PROVABILITY}_{\\mathsf{T}}\\), then this would already have enormous significance for mathematical practice. For note that it seems plausible to assume that no human mathematician will ever be able to comprehend a proof containing 100 million symbols (\\(\\approx 25000\\) pages). If we were able to efficiently check if \\(\\phi \\in n\\text{-}\\sc{PROVABILITY}_{\\mathsf{T}}\\) (say for \\(n = 10^8\\)) and obtained a negative answer, G\u00f6del concludes that \u201cthere would be no reason to think further about [\\(\\phi\\)]\u201d (1956, p. 612). For in this case a demonstration that \\(\\phi \\not\\in n\\text{-}\\sc{PROVABILITY}_{\\mathsf{T}}\\) (for a sufficiently large \\(n\\) and a sufficiently powerful \\(\\mathsf{T}\\)) would be sufficient to show that we have no hope of ever comprehending a proof of \\(\\phi\\) even if one were to exist.\nBut now note that since \\(n\\text{-}\\sc{PROVABILITY}_{\\mathsf{T}} \\in \\textbf{NP}\\), if it so happened that \\(\\textbf{P} = \\textbf{NP}\\) then the task of determining whether a mathematical formula is derivable in our preferred mathematical theory by a proof of feasible length would be checkable by an efficient algorithm. G\u00f6del suggests that this would have the following consequence:\n\n[D]espite the unsolvability of the Entscheidungsproblem the mental effort of the mathematician in the case of yes-or-no questions could be completely replaced by machines.[38] (G\u00f6del 1956, 612)\n\nBuilding on this observation, several more recent commentators (e.g. Impagliazzo 1995, Arora and Barak 2009, and Fortnow 2013) have also underscored the significance of Open Question 1 by suggesting that \\(\\textbf{P} = \\textbf{NP}\\) would entail the dispensability of creativity not just in mathematics, but also for a number of other tasks \u2013 e.g. theory construction or music composition \u2013 which are traditionally thought to involve elements of non-algorithmic insight.\nBut although the coincidence of \\(\\textbf{P}\\) and \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) would have intriguing consequences, it also seems likely that the discovery of a proof validating the consensus view that \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\) would be regarded as foundationally significant. As we have seen, the sort of evidence most often cited in favor of the proper inclusion of \\(\\textbf{P}\\) in \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) is the failure of protracted attempts to find polynomial time algorithms for problems in \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) in which we have a strong practical interest either in deciding in practice or in proving to be intractable.[39] A proof that \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\) would thus not only have the effect of validating such inductive evidence, but it would provide additional evidence that the Cobham-Edmonds Thesis provides a correct analysis of the pre-theoretical notion of feasibility. In particular, it would allow us to unconditionally assert that \\(\\textbf{NP}\\)-hard problems are intractable in the general case.\nRecall, however, that such inductive considerations form only part of the overall evidence which can be cited in favor of \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\). In particular, various heuristic considerations also point to the non-coincidence of the classes \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) and \\(\\textbf{coNP}\\) and of \\(\\textbf{PH}\\) and \\(\\textbf{PSPACE}\\), and hence to positive answers for Open Questions 2 and 3. But were it to be the case that \\(\\textbf{P} = \\textbf{NP}\\), then these questions would be resolved negatively in a manner which runs strongly counter to our current expectations (see Sections \n 3.4.1 and 3.4.2).\nGiven the convergence of several forms of non-demonstrative evidence for the conjecture that \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\), it is also reasonable to ask why this statement has proven so difficult to resolve in practice. For note that although this statement originates in theoretical computer science, it may be easily formulated as statements about natural numbers. In particular, \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\) is equivalent to the statement that for all indices \\(e\\) and exponents \\(k\\), there exists a propositional formula \\(\\phi\\) such that the deterministic Turing machine \\(T_e\\) does not correctly decide \\(\\phi\\)\u2019s membership in \\(\\sc{SAT}\\) in \\(\\lvert \\phi\\rvert^k\\) steps. Using familiar techniques from the arithmetization of syntax, it is not difficult to see that this statement can be formalized in the language of first-order arithmetic as a \\(\\Pi^0_2\\)-statement \u2013 i.e. a statement \\(\\Theta\\) of the form \\(\\forall x \\exists y \\psi(x,y)\\) where \\(\\psi(x,y)\\) contains only bounded numerical quantifiers.\nBased on its logical form alone, we cannot currently exclude the possibility that \\(\\Theta\\) is independent not just of first-order Peano arithmetic [\\(\\mathsf{PA}\\)], but of even stronger axiom systems such as \\(\\textsf{ZFC}\\). But although early results suggested \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\) may be independent of some very weak axiomatic theories (e.g. DeMillo and Lipton 1980), it is now believed that this statement is unlikely to be independent of stronger theories like \\(\\mathsf{PA}\\) which approximate the mathematical axioms we employ in practice. In particular, Ben-David and Halevi (1992) showed that if it were possible to use current proof theoretic techniques to show the independence of \\(\\Theta\\) from \\(\\textsf{PA}\\), then this demonstration itself would also show that \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) is very close to being in \\(\\textbf{P}\\) in a sense which can be made precise using techniques from circuit complexity.[40] As this is thought to be implausible, Aaronson (2003) suggests that we currently possess no reason to suspect that \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\) is more likely to be independent of \\(\\textsf{PA}\\) (let alone \\(\\mathsf{ZFC}\\)) than other currently open number theoretic statements.\nBut at the same time, a consensus has also developed that it is unlikely that we will be able to settle the status of \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}?\\) on the basis of currently known methods of proof. A familiar example is the method of diagonalization, as employed in the proof of the undecidability of the classical Halting Problem (from which it follows that the recursive languages are properly included in the recursively enumerable ones). We have seen that a variant of this method can be used to show \\(\\textbf{P} \\subsetneq \\textbf{EXP}\\) in the proof of Theorem 3.1. But diagonalization proofs yielding such separations typically relativize to oracle-based computation in the following sense: if such a proof yields \\(\\textbf{C}_1 \\neq \\textbf{C}_2\\) for complexity classes \\(\\textbf{C}_1\\) and \\(\\textbf{C}_2\\), then a suitable modification will also typically yield \\(\\textbf{C}^A_1 \\neq \\textbf{C}^A_2\\) for all oracles \\(A \\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^*\\).[41]  Baker, Gill, and Solovay (1975) famously established the existence of oracles \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) such that \\(\\textbf{P}^A = \\textbf{NP}^A\\) and \\(\\textbf{P}^B \\neq \\textbf{NP}^B\\). As we would expect a proof of \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\) based on diagonalization to relativize to both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), this suggests that it is not possible to use this method to separate \\(\\textbf{P}\\) and \\(\\textbf{NP}\\).\nDespite the negative character of this and other results which are often taken to bear on the status of \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\)?, resolving this and the other open questions remains an important topic of research in theoretical computer science. Several programs for separating complexity classes have recently been explored using techniques from circuit complexity (e.g. Razborov and Rudich 1994), proof theory (e.g. Buss 1999), and algebraic geometry (e.g. Mulmuley and Sohoni 2001). However, the current consensus (e.g. Fortnow 2009) is that these approaches are still in need of substantial refinement or that genuinely new methods will be required in order to yield the desired separations.\nIt thus seems reasonable to summarize the current status of the \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\)? problem as follows: (i) \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\) is widely believed to be true on the basis of convergent inductive and heuristic evidence; (ii) we currently have no reason to suspect that this statement is formally independent of the mathematical theories which we accept in practice; but (iii) a proof \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\) is still considered to be beyond the reach of current techniques.\n4.2 Satisfiability, validity, and model checking\nWe have seen that logic provides many examples of problems which are studied in complexity theory. Of these, the most often considered are satisfiability, validity, and model checking. In order to formulate these problems uniformly, it is convenient to take a logic \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) to be a triple \\(\\langle \\text{Form}_{\\mathcal{L}}, \\mathfrak{A}, \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} \\rangle \\) consisting of a set of formulas \\(\\text{Form}_{\\mathcal{L}}\\), a class of structures \\(\\mathfrak{A}\\) in which the members of \\(\\text{Form}_{\\mathcal{L}}\\) are interpreted, and a satisfaction relation \\(\\models_{\\mathcal{L}}\\) which holds between structures and formulas. We may assume that \\(\\text{Form}_{\\mathcal{L}}\\) is specified in the manner typified by propositional logic \u2013 i.e. as a set of syntactic primitives and inductive formulation rules. On the other hand, the definitions of both \\(\\mathfrak{A}\\) and \\(\\models_{\\mathcal{L}}\\) will vary according to the sort of logic in question \u2013 e.g. in the case of classical propositional logic, \\(\\mathfrak{A}\\) will be the class of atomic valuations \\(v:\\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}\\) and \\(v \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} \\phi\\) holds just in case \\(\\phi\\) is true with respect to \\(v\\) (as defined by the usual truth table rules), and in the case of modal logic \\(\\mathfrak{A}\\) will typically be a class of Kripke models satisfying a given frame condition and \\(\\models_{\\mathcal{L}}\\) is the standard forcing relation \\(\\mathcal{A},w \\Vdash \\phi\\) which holds between a model, a world, and a formula.\nGiven a logic \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) specified in this manner, we may now formulate the following problems:\n\\(\\sc{SATISFIABILITY}_{\\mathcal{L}}\\ \\)\nGiven a formula \\(\\phi \\in \\text{Form}_{\\mathcal{L}}\\), does there exist a structure \\(\\mathcal{A} \\in \\mathfrak{A}\\) such that \\(\\mathcal{A} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} \\phi\\)?\n\\(\\sc{VALIDITY}_{\\mathcal{L}}\\ \\)\nGiven a formula \\(\\phi \\in \\text{Form}_{\\mathcal{L}}\\), is it the case that for all \\(\\mathcal{A} \\in \\mathfrak{A}\\), \\(\\mathcal{A} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} \\phi\\)?\n\\(\\sc{MODEL}\\ \\sc{CHECKING}_{\\mathcal{L}}\\ \\)\nGiven a formula \\(\\phi \\in \\text{Form}_{\\mathcal{L}}\\) and a structure \\(\\mathcal{A} \\in \\mathfrak{A}\\), is it the case that \\(\\mathcal{A} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} \\phi\\)?\nTo specify these problems formally, a suitable encoding of the members of \\(\\text{Form}_{\\mathcal{L}}\\) and \\(\\mathfrak{A}\\) as finite binary strings must be provided. Although this is typically unproblematic in the case of \\(\\text{Form}_{\\mathcal{L}}\\), \\(\\mathfrak{A}\\) may sometimes include infinite structures. In this case, the model checking problem is only considered for finite structures (which we must also assume are encoded as finite strings \u2013 e.g. in the manner described by Marx 2007). And in cases where a logic is standardly characterized proof theoretically rather than semantically \u2013 i.e. as the set of formulas derivable from some set of axioms of \\(\\Gamma_{\\mathcal{L}}\\) rather than the class of formulas true in all structures \u2013 the validity problem is understood to coincide with the problem of deciding whether \\(\\phi\\) is derivable from \\(\\Gamma_{\\mathcal{L}}\\). In such cases, the satisfiability and model checking problems are generally not considered.\nThe problems \\(\\sc{SATISFIABILITY}_{\\mathcal{L}}\\), \\(\\sc{VALIDITY}_{\\mathcal{L}}\\), and \\(\\sc{MODEL}\\ \\sc{CHECKING}_{\\mathcal{L}}\\) have been studied for many of the logics employed in philosophy, computer science, and artificial intelligence. A number of results are summarized in Table 1, focusing on systems surveyed in other articles in this encyclopedia.

The complexity of the satisfiability, validity, and model checking problems for some common logics.\n\n4.3 Proof complexity\nWe have seen that the satisfiability and validity problems for propositional logic are respectively complete for \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) and \\(\\textbf{coNP}\\). Although these problems are characterized in terms of the semantics for propositional logic, certain questions about its proof theory may also be addressed using techniques from complexity theory. By a proof system \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) for propositional logic we understand a definition of the symbol \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{P}}\\) which characterizes what it means for a formula \\(\\phi\\) to be derivable from a given set of axioms and rules. We write \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{P}} \\phi\\) just in case there is a derivation \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) (e.g. a finite tree or sequence of formulas) with \\(\\phi\\) as its conclusion in the system \\(\\mathcal{P}\\). Examples of such formalisms include standard definitions of Hilbert systems \\(\\mathcal{P}_1\\),[43] natural deduction systems \\(\\mathcal{P}_2\\), and sequent systems \\(\\mathcal{P}_3\\) for propositional logic (see, e.g., Troelstra and Schwichtenberg 2000; Negri and Von Plato 2001). Each of these systems may be shown to be sound and complete for propositional validity \u2013 i.e. for all propositional formulas \\(\\phi\\), \\(\\phi \\in \\sc{VALID}\\) if and only if \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{P}_i} \\phi\\) for \\(i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}\\).\nIn the context of complexity theory, it is convenient to reformulate the definition of a proof system as a mapping \\(\\mathcal{P}: \\{0,1\\}^* \\rightarrow  \\sc{VALID}\\) whose domain consist of all binary string and whose range is the class of all valid formulas. Recall, for instance, that a Hilbert derivation is a finite sequences of formulas \\(\\psi_1,\\ldots,\\psi_n\\) each of whose members is either a logical axiom or follows from earlier members by modus ponens.  A finite sequence of formulas  can be encoded as a binary string so that it is may be recognized in polynomial time if  \\(x \\in \\{0,1\\}^*\\) is the code of a well-formed proof.  \\( \\mathcal{P}\\) can now be defined so if \\( x\\) encodes such a derivation, then \\( \\mathcal{P}(x) = \\psi_n \\) (i.e. the conclusion of the derivation) and \\( \\mathcal{P}(x)\\) is some fixed tautology otherwise.\n\nSuch a system is said to be polynomially bounded if there exists a polynomial \\(p(n)\\) such that for all \\(\\phi \\in \\sc{VALID}\\), there is a derivation \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) such that \\(\\mathcal{P}(\\ulcorner \\mathcal{D} \\urcorner) = \\phi\\) and \\(\\lvert \\ulcorner \\mathcal{D}\\urcorner \\rvert \\leq p(\\lvert \\phi \\rvert)\\) \u2013 i.e. just in case all tautologies of size \\(n\\) possess \\(\\mathcal{P}\\)-proofs of size at most \\(p(n)\\).\nThe basic observation about such systems is as follows:\n\nTheorem 4.1 (Cook and Reckhow 1979) There exist a polynomially bounded proof system if and only if \\(\\textbf{NP} = \\textbf{coNP}\\).[44]\nSince it is strongly suspected that \\(\\textbf{NP} \\neq \\textbf{coNP}\\) (see \n Section 3.4.1), the current consensus is that polynomial proof systems do not exist. At present, however, the failure of polynomial boundedness has not been proven for most familiar proof systems, inclusive of \\(\\mathcal{P}_1\\), \\(\\mathcal{P}_2\\), and \\(\\mathcal{P}_3\\).\nA natural question to ask about a proof system \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) is thus whether it is possible to identify classes of tautologies \\(H\\) which are \u2018hard\u2019 in the sense that any \\(\\mathcal{P}\\)-proof demonstrating that \\(\\phi \\in H\\) is valid must be infeasibly long relative to the size of \\(\\phi\\). A positive answer was obtained by Haken (1985) for the system known as resolution on which many automated theorem-provers are based. Haken\u2019s proof made use of Cook and Reckhow\u2019s (1979) observation that we may formulate the Pigeon Hole Principle (PHP) \u2013 i.e. the statement that any assignment of \\(n+1\\) pigeons to \\(n\\) holes must assign two pigeons to some hole \u2013 in propositional logic by using the atomic letter \\(P_{ij}\\) to express that pigeon \\(i\\) gets placed in hole \\(j\\). The formula\n\n\\[\n\\text{PHP}_n = \\bigwedge_{0 \\leq i \\leq n} \\ \\bigvee_{0 \\leq j \\lt n} P_{ij} \\rightarrow \\bigvee_{0 \\leq i \\lt m \\leq n} \\bigvee_{0 \\leq j \\lt n} (P_{ij} \\wedge P_{mj})\n\\]\n\nwhich formalizes the \\(n\\)-pigeon version of PHP is thus a tautology for each \\(n\\). \\(\\text{PHP}_n\\) is hence provable in any complete proof system for propositional logic.\nHaken showed that any resolution proof of \\(\\text{PHP}_n\\) must have size at least exponential in \\(n\\). From this it follows that resolution is not polynomially bounded. However, it was later shown by Buss (1987) that the system \\(\\mathcal{P}_1\\) (and hence also systems like \\(\\mathcal{P}_2\\), \\(\\mathcal{P}_3\\) which can be shown to efficiently simulate \\(\\mathcal{P}_1\\)) do admit proofs of \\(\\text{PHP}_n\\) which are of size polynomial in \\(n\\).  One subsequent direction of research in proof complexity has been to identify additional proof systems for which PHP or related combinatorial principles are also hard.  See, e.g., Buss (2012), Segerlind (2007).\n4.4 Descriptive complexity\nAnother connection between logic and computational complexity is provided by the subject known as descriptive complexity theory. As we have seen, a problem \\(X\\) is taken to be \u2018complex\u2019 in the sense of computational complexity theory in proportion to how difficult it is to decide algorithmically. On the other hand, descriptive complexity takes a problem to be \u2018complex\u2019 in proportion to the logical resources which are required to describe its instances. In other words, the descriptive complexity of \\(X\\) is measured according to the sort of formulas which is needed to define its instances relative to an appropriate background class of finitary structures.\nDescriptive complexity begins with the observation that since computational problems are comprised by finite combinatorial objects (e.g. strings, graphs, formulas, etc.), it is possible to describe their instances as finite structures in the conventional sense of first-order model theory. In particular, given a problem \\(X\\), we associate with each of its instances \\(x \\in X\\) a finite structure \\(\\mathcal{A}_x\\) over a relational signature \\(\\tau\\) whose non-logical vocabulary will depend on the type of objects which comprise \\(X\\).[45]\nGiven such a signature \\(\\tau\\), we define \\(\\text{Mod}(\\tau)\\) to be the class of all \\(\\tau\\)-structures with finite domain. In the context of descriptive complexity theory, a logic \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is taken to be an extension of the language of first-order logic with one or more classes of additional expressions such as higher-order quantifiers or fixed-point operators. These are treated semantically as logical symbols. If \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is such a logic, and \\(\\tau\\) a signature, we write \\(\\text{Sent}_{\\mathcal{L}(\\tau)}\\) to denote the class of well-formed sentences constructed using the logical symbols from \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) and the relational symbols from \\(\\tau\\). A sentence \\(\\phi \\in \\text{Sent}_{\\mathcal{L}(\\tau)}\\) is said to define a problem \\(X\\) just in case \\(X\\) is coextensive with the set of \\(\\tau\\)-structures satisfying \\(\\phi\\) \u2013 i.e.\n\n\\[\n\\{\\mathcal{A}_x \\mid x \\in X \\} = \\{\\mathcal{A} \\in \\text{Mod}(\\tau) \\mid \\mathcal{A} \\models \\phi \\}\n\\]\n\nIf \\(\\textbf{C}\\) is a complexity class, then a logic \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is said to capture \\(\\textbf{C}\\) just in case for every problem \\(X \\in \\textbf{C}\\), there is a signature \\(\\tau\\) and a formula \\(\\phi \\in \\text{Form}_{\\mathcal{L}(\\tau)}\\) which defines \\(X\\).\nDescriptive characterizations have been obtained for many of the major complexity classes considered in Section 3, several of which are summarized in Table 2. The first such characterization was established with respect to second-order existential logic (\\(\\mathsf{SO}\\exists\\)). The language of this system includes formulas of the form \\(\\exists Z_1 \\ldots \\exists Z_n \\phi(\\vec{x},Z_1,\\ldots,Z_n)\\) where the variables \\(Z_i\\) are second-order and \\(\\phi\\) itself contains no other second-order quantifiers. Fagin (1974) established the following:\nTheorem 4.2 \n\\(\\textbf{NP}\\) is captured by the logic \\(\\mathsf{SO}\\exists\\).\nThis result provided one of the first machine independent characterizations of an important complexity class \u2013 i.e. one whose formulation does not make reference to a specific model of computation such as \\(\\mathfrak{T}\\) or \\(\\mathfrak{A}\\). The availability of such characterizations is often taken to provide additional evidence for the mathematical robustness of classes like \\(\\textbf{NP}\\).\nTheorem 4.2 generalizes to provide a characterization of the classes which comprise the Polynomial Hierarchy. For instance, the logics \\(\\Sigma^1_i\\) and \\(\\Pi^1_i\\) uniformly capture the complexity classes \\(\\Sigma^P_i\\) and \\(\\Pi^P_i\\) (where \\(\\mathsf{SO}\\exists = \\Sigma^1_1\\) ). Moreover \\(\\mathsf{SO}\\) (i.e. full second-order logic) captures \\(\\textbf{PH}\\) itself. On the other hand, it can also be shown that first-order logic (\\(\\mathsf{FO}\\)) captures only a very weak complexity class known as \\(\\textbf{AC}^0\\) consisting of languages decidable by polynomial size circuits of constant depth.\nIn order to characterize additional classes, other means of extending the expressive capacity of first-order logic must be considered such as adding least fixed point or transitive closure operators. Consider, for instance, a formula \\(\\psi(R,\\vec{x})\\) in which the \\(n\\)-ary relation \\(R\\) only appears positively (i.e. in the scope of an even number of negations) and \\(\\vec{x}\\) is of length \\(m\\). If \\(A\\) is the domain of a structure \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), then such a formula will induce a monotone mapping of type \\(\\Phi_{\\psi(R,\\vec{x})}\\) from the power set of \\(A^n\\) to the power set of \\(A^m\\) defined by \\(\\Phi_{\\psi(R,\\vec{x})}(B) = \\{\\vec{a} \\in A^m \\mid \\mathcal{A}^R_B \\models \\psi(R,\\vec{a}) \\}\\) where \\(\\mathcal{A}^R_B\\) denotes the model in which the symbol \\(R\\) is interpreted as \\(B \\subseteq A^n\\) and is just like \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) otherwise. In such a case it follows that there will exist a least fixed point for the mapping \\(\\Phi_{\\psi(R,\\vec{x})}\\) \u2013 i.e. a set \\(F \\subseteq A^n\\) such that \\(\\Phi_{\\psi(R,\\vec{x})}(F) = F\\) and which is contained in all other sets with this property (see, e.g., Moschovakis 1974). Let us denote this set by \\(\\text{Fix}^{\\mathcal{A}}(\\psi(R,\\vec{x}))\\).[46]\nThe logic \\(\\textsf{FO}(\\texttt{LFP})\\) can now be defined as the extension of first-order logic with the new relation symbols \\(\\texttt{LFP}_{\\psi({R,\\vec{x}})}\\) for each formula \\(\\psi(R,\\vec{x})\\) in which the relation variable appears only positively and with new atomic formulas of the form \\(\\texttt{LFP}_{\\psi({R,\\vec{x}})}(\\vec{t})\\). Such formulas are interpreted as follows: \\(\\mathcal{A} \\models \\texttt{LFP}_{\\psi({R,\\vec{x}})}(\\vec{t})\\) if and only if \\(\\vec{t}^{\\mathcal{A}} \\in \\text{Fix}^{\\mathcal{A}}(\\psi(R,\\vec{x}))\\). The logic \\(\\textsf{FO}(\\texttt{TC})\\)is similarly defined by adding a transitive closure operator \\(\\texttt{TC}_{\\psi(\\vec{x})}(\\vec{x})\\) which holds of a term \\(\\vec{t}\\) just in case \\(\\vec{t}^{\\mathcal{A}}\\) is in the transitive closure of the relation denoted by \\(\\psi(\\vec{x})\\) in \\(\\mathcal{A}\\).  The logic \\(\\textsf{SO}(\\texttt{LFP})\\) and \\(\\textsf{SO}(\\texttt{TC})\\) are defined analogously by adding these operators to \\(\\textsf{SO}\\) and allowing them to apply to formulas containing second-order variables.\nWe may now state another major result of descriptive complexity theory:\nTheorem 4.3 (Immerman 1982; Vardi 1982) \\(\\textbf{P}\\) is captured by \\(\\textsf{FO}(\\texttt{LFP})\\) relative to ordered models (i.e. models \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) for structures interpreting \\(\\leq\\) as a linear order on \\(A\\)).\nImmerman (1999, p. 61) describes Theorem 4.3 as \u201cincreas[ing] our intuition that polynomial time is a class whose fundamental nature goes beyond the machine models with which it is usually defined\u201d.  Taken in conjunction with Theorem 4.2 it also provides a logical reformulation of the \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}?\\) problem itself \u2013 i.e. \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\) if and only if there exists a class of ordered structures definable in existential second-order logic which is not definable by a formula of \\(\\textsf{FO}(\\texttt{LFP})\\).\n On the other hand, the restriction to ordered structures in the formulation of Theorem 4.3 is known to be essential in the sense that there are simply describable languages in \\(\\textbf{P}\\) \u2013 e.g.\n\n\\[\n \\sc{PARITY} = \\{w \\in \\{0,1\\}^* : w \\text{ contains an odd number of 1s}\\}\n\\] \n\n\n\u2013 which cannot be define over \\(\\textsf{FO}(\\texttt{LFP})\\) without using \\(\\leq\\). More generally, the question of there exists a logic which captures  \\( \\textbf{P}\\) over unordered structures is currently one of the major open questions in descriptive complexity.  See, e.g., (Ebbinghaus and Flum 1999) and (Chen and Flum 2010).\n\n\n\nComplexity class\nLogic\nReference\n\n\n\\(\\textbf{AC}^0\\)\n\\(\\mathsf{FO}\\)\n(Immerman 1999)\n\n\n\\(\\textbf{NL}\\)\n\\(\\textsf{FO}(\\texttt{TC})\\)\n(Immerman 1987)\n\n\n\\(\\textbf{P}\\)\n\\(\\textsf{FO}(\\texttt{LFP})\\)\n(Immerman 1982), (Vardi 1982)\n\n\n\\(\\textbf{NP}\\)\n\\(\\textsf{SO}\\exists\\)\n(Fagin 1974)\n\n\n\\(\\Sigma^P_i\\)\n\\(\\textsf{SO}\\Sigma^1_i\\)\n(Stockmeyer 1977)\n\n\n\\(\\Pi^P_i\\)\n\\(\\textsf{SO}\\Pi^1_i\\)\n(Stockmeyer 1977)\n\n\n\\(\\textbf{PH}\\)\n\\(\\textsf{SO}\\)\n(Stockmeyer 1977)\n\n\n\\(\\textbf{PSPACE}\\)\n\\(\\textsf{SO}(\\texttt{TC})\\)\n(Immerman 1987)\n\n\n\\(\\textbf{EXP}\\)\n\\(\\textsf{SO}(\\texttt{LFP})\\)\n(Immerman 1999)\n\n\nTable 2. Descriptive characterization of complexity classes.\n\n4.5 Bounded arithmetic\nAnother connection between logic and computational complexity is provided by first-order arithmetical theories which are similar in form to familiar systems such as Primitive Recursive Arithmetic and Peano arithmetic. Connections between formal arithmetic and computability theory have been known since the 1940s \u2013 e.g. the sets of natural numbers definable by \\(\\Delta^0_1\\)-formulas and \\(\\Sigma^0_1\\)-formulas in the standard model of arithmetic respectively correspond to the recursive and recursively enumerable sets, the provably total functions of \\(\\textrm{I}\\Sigma^0_1\\) correspond to the primitive recursive functions while those of \\(\\mathsf{PA}\\) correspond to the \\(\\epsilon_0\\)-recursive functions (cf., e.g.,   Schwichtenberg 2011). From the 1970s onwards, a number of similar results have been obtained which link the levels of the Polynomial Hierarchy to a class of first-order theories collectively known as bounded arithmetics.\nIn the course of studying the relationship between arithmetic and complexity theory, it is often useful to consider functions in addition to sets. For instance we may consider the class \\(\\textbf{FP} =_{\\text{df}}\\Box^P_1\\) of functions computable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. Similarly, we define \\(\\Box^P_{n+1}\\) to be the class of functions computable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time with the use of an oracles for a set in level \\(\\Sigma^P_n\\) of \\(\\textbf{PH}\\). As in the case of \\(\\textbf{PH}\\), it is not known whether the hierarchy \\(\\Box^P_1 \\subseteq \\Box^P_2 \\subseteq \\ldots\\) collapses.\nA first link between formal arithmetic and complexity was provided by Cobham\u2019s (1965) original characterization of \\(\\textbf{FP}\\) in terms of a functional algebra similar to that by which the primitive recursive functions are defined. The class in question is generated by the following class of basis functions \\(\\mathcal{F}_0\\):\n\n\\[\nz(x) = 0, s_0(x) = 2 \\cdot x, s_1(x) = 2 x + 1, \\pi^i_n(x_1, \\dots ,x_n) = x_i, x \\# y = 2^{\\lvert x\\rvert \\cdot \\lvert y\\rvert}\n\\]\n\nWe also define the following variant of primitive recursion:\n\nDefinition 4.1  The function \\(f(\\vec{x},y)\\) is said to be defined from \\(g(\\vec{x}), h_0(\\vec{x},y,z), h_1(\\vec{x},y,z)\\) and \\(k(\\vec{x},y)\\) by limited recursion on notation just in case\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n f(\\vec{x},0) &= g(\\vec{x})\\\\\n f(\\vec{x},s_0(y)) &= h_0(\\vec{x},y,f(\\vec{x},y)) \\\\\n f(\\vec{x},s_1(y)) &= h_1(\\vec{x},y,f(\\vec{x},y))\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nand \\(f(\\vec{x},y) \\leq k(\\vec{x},y)\\) for all \\(\\vec{x},y\\).\n\nWe define the class \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) of functions definable by limited recursion on notation to be the least class containing \\(\\mathcal{F}_0\\) and closed under composition and the foregoing scheme. A slight variant of Cobham\u2019s original result may now be stated as follows:\nTheorem 4.4  (Cobham 1965; Rose 1984) \\(f(\\vec{x}) \\in \\textbf{FP}\\) if and only if \\(f(\\vec{x}) \\in \\mathcal{F}\\).\nLike Theorems 4.2 and 4.3, Theorem 4.4 is significant because it provides another machine-independent characterization of an important complexity class. Recall, however, that Cobham was working at a time when the mathematical status of the notion of feasibility was still under debate. So it is also reasonable to ask if the definition of \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) can  be understood as providing an independently motivated analysis of feasible computability akin to the analyses which Church and Turing are often said to have provided for effective computability.\nRelative to the standards discussed in  Section 1.1 \n it seems reasonable to maintain  that the basis functions \\(\\mathcal{F}_0\\) are feasibly computable and also that this property is preserved under composition. Now suppose that \\(f(x,y)\\) is defined by limited recursion on notation from \\(g(x), h_0(x,y,z), h_1(x,y,z)\\) and \\(k(x,y)\\). In this case, \\(f(x,y) = h_i(x,\\lceil \\frac{y}{2} \\rceil,f(x,\\lceil \\frac{y}{2} \\rceil))\\) depending on whether \\(y \\gt 0\\) is even (\\(i = 0\\)) or odd (\\(i = 1\\)). From this it follows that the depth of the recursion required to compute the value of \\(f(x,y)\\) will be proportional to \\(\\log_2(y)\\) \u2013 i.e. proportional to the length of \\(y\\)\u2019s binary representation, as opposed to \\(y\\) itself as when \\(f(x,y+1)\\) is defined as \\(h(x,y,f(x,y))\\) by ordinary primitive recursion. This suggests that feasibility is also preserved when a function is defined by limited recursion on notation.\nIt is harder to motivate the inclusion of the function \\(x \\# y\\) in \\(\\mathcal{F}_0\\) and of the condition \\(f(x,y) \\leq k(x,y)\\) in Definition 4.1 on pre-theoretical grounds alone. For these features of the definition of \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) can be see to have precisely the effect of placing a polynomial bound on the auxiliary functions which can be computed during the sort of length-bounded recursion just described. On the other hand, such indirect reference to polynomial rates of growth is avoided in similar functional characterizations of \\(\\textbf{FP}\\) due to Leivant (1994) (using a form of positive second-order definability over strings) and Bellantoni and Cook (1992) (using a structural modification of the traditional primitive recursion scheme).\nDirect reference to polynomial rates of growth is also avoided in the formulation of the first-order arithmetical theory now known as \\(\\text{I}\\Delta_0\\) (which was originally introduced by Parikh (1971) under the name \\(\\textsf{PB}\\)). \\(\\text{I}\\Delta_0\\) is formulated over the traditional language of first-order arithmetic \u2013 i.e. \\(\\mathcal{L}_a = \\{0,s,+,x,\\lt\\}\\) \u2013 and consists of the axioms of Robinson\u2019s \\(\\mathsf{Q}\\) together with the restriction of the induction scheme of \\(\\mathsf{PA}\\) arithmetic to \\(\\Delta_0\\)-formulas \u2013 i.e. those containing only bounded quantifiers of the form \\(\\forall x \\leq t\\) or \\(\\exists x \\leq t\\) where \\(t\\) is a term not containing \\(x\\).\nPrior to this Bennett (1962) had shown that there exists a \\(\\Delta_0\\)-formula \\(\\varepsilon(x,y,z)\\) which defines the graph of the exponentiation function relative to the standard model of arithmetic. \\(\\text{I}\\Delta_0\\) proves that \\(\\varepsilon(x,y,z)\\) satisfies the standard defining equations for exponentiation. But it may also be shown that this theory does not prove the totality of exponentiation under this or any other definition in the following sense:\nTheorem 4.5  (Parikh 1971) \nSuppose that \\(\\text{I}\\Delta_0 \\vdash \\forall \\vec{x}  \\exists y \\phi(\\vec{x},y)\\) where \\(\\phi(\\vec{x},y)\\) is itself \\(\\Sigma_1\\) . Then for some \\(\\mathcal{L}_a\\)-term \\(t(\\vec{x})\\), \\(\\text{I}\\Delta_0 \\vdash \\forall \\vec{x} \\exists y \\leq t(\\vec{x}) \\phi(\\vec{x},y)\\).\nRecall that a function \\(f(\\vec{x})\\) is provably total in a theory \\(\\mathsf{T}\\) just in case there is a \\(\\Sigma_1\\)-formula \\(\\phi_f(\\vec{x},y)\\) defining the graph of \\(f(\\vec{x})\\) in the language of \\(\\mathsf{T}\\) such that \\(\\mathsf{T} \\vdash \\forall \\vec{x} \\exists ! y \\phi_f(\\vec{x},y)\\). Since terms in the language of arithmetic are polynomials with positive coefficients, it follows from Theorem 4.3 that all of the provably total functions of \\(\\text{I}\\Delta_0\\) are of polynomial rate of growth. In particular, exponentiation is not provably total in this theory.  For this reason Parikh referred to \\(\\text{I}\\Delta_0\\) as an \u201canthropomorphic system\u201d.[47]\n In order to obtain arithmetical theories which describe \\(\\textbf{P}\\) and the higher levels of \\(\\textbf{PH}\\) precisely, two approaches have been pursued, respectively due to Buss (1986) and to Zambella (1996). Buss presented a sequence of first-order theories\n\n\\[\n\\mathsf{S}^1_2 \\subseteq \\mathsf{T}^1_2 \\subseteq \\mathsf{S}^2_2 \\subseteq \\ldots \\mathsf{S}^i_2 \\subseteq \\mathsf{T}^i_2 \\subseteq \\mathsf{S}^{i+1}_2 \\subseteq \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhose provably total functions correspond to the levels of the hierarchy \\(\\Box^P_i\\). These theories are stated over the language \\(\\mathcal{L}^b_a = \\{0,s,+,x,\\lt,\\lvert \\cdot\\rvert,\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\rfloor, \\#\\}\\), where the intended interpretation of \\(\\lvert x\\rvert\\) is \\(\\lceil \\log_2(x+1) \\rceil\\), and of \\(x\\#y\\) is \\(2^{\\lvert x\\rvert \\cdot \\lvert y\\rvert}\\) as above. Whereas a traditional bounded quantifier is of the form \\(\\forall x \\lt t\\) or \\(\\exists x \\lt t\\), a so-called sharply bounded quantifier is of the form \\(\\forall x \\lt \\lvert t\\rvert\\) or \\(\\exists x \\lt \\lvert t\\rvert\\) (for \\(t\\) an \\(\\mathcal{L}^b_a\\)-term not involving \\(x\\)). The syntactic classes \\(\\Sigma^b_i\\) and \\(\\Pi^b_i\\) are defined in a manner reminiscent to how the classes \\(\\Sigma^0_i\\) and \\(\\Pi^0_i\\) are defined in the traditional arithmetical hierarchy \u2013 i.e. by counting alternations of bounded quantifiers, ignoring sharply bounded ones.\nThe theories \\(\\mathsf{S}^i_2\\) and \\(\\mathsf{T}^i_2\\) both extend a base theory known as \\(\\textsf{BASIC}\\). \\(\\textsf{BASIC}\\) contains 32 axioms, which include those of \\(\\mathsf{Q}\\), as well as others which axiomatize the intended interpretations of \\(\\lvert \\dots\\rvert\\), \\(\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\rfloor\\) and \\(\\#\\) (see, e.g., H\u00e1jek and Pudl\u00e1k 1998, 321\u201322). We also define the following induction schemas:\n\\(\\Sigma^b_i\\)-\\(\\text{IND}\\ \\ \\) \\(\\phi(0) \\wedge \\forall x(\\phi(x) \\rightarrow \\phi(x+1)) \\rightarrow \\forall x \\phi(x)\\)\nfor all \\(\\phi(x) \\in \\Sigma^b_i\\).\n\\(\\Sigma^b_i\\)-\\(\\text{PIND}\\ \\ \\ \\) \\(\\phi(0) \\wedge \\forall x (\\phi(\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\rfloor) \\rightarrow \\phi(x)) \\rightarrow \\forall x \\phi(x)\\) \nfor all \\(\\phi(x) \\in \\Sigma^b_i\\).\nFinally, we define the theories \\(\\mathsf{S}^i_2 = \\mathsf{BASIC} + \\Sigma^b_i\\)-\\(\\text{PIND}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{T}^i_2 = \\mathsf{BASIC} + \\Sigma^b_i\\)-\\(\\text{IND}\\) and also \\(\\mathsf{S}_2 = \\bigcup_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\mathsf{S}^i_2\\) and \\(\\mathsf{T}_2 = \\bigcup_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\mathsf{T}^i_2\\).\nSome basic results linking the language \\(\\mathcal{L}^b_a\\) and these theories to the Polynomial Hierarchy are as follows:\nTheorem 4.6 (Kent and Hodgson 1982) A set \\(X\\) belongs to \\(\\Sigma^P_i\\) if and only \\(X\\) is definable by a \\(\\Sigma^b_i\\)-formula \\(\\phi(x)\\) in the standard model \u2013 i.e. \\(X = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\mathcal{N} \\models \\phi(\\overline{n}) \\}\\).\nTheorem 4.7 (Buss 1986) A function \\(f(\\vec{x})\\) belongs to \\(\\Box^P_i\\) if and only if \\(f(\\vec{x})\\) is provably total in \\(\\mathsf{S}^i_2\\) relative to a \\(\\Sigma^b_i\\)-definition \u2013 i.e. if and only if there is a \\(\\Sigma^b_i\\)-formula \\(\\phi_f(\\vec{x},y)\\) such that \\(\\mathsf{S}^i_2 \\vdash \\forall \\vec{x} \\exists ! y \\phi_f(\\vec{x},y)\\).\nIt follows from Theorem 4.7 that \\(f(\\vec{x})\\) is computable in polynomial time just in case it is provably total in \\(\\mathsf{S}^1_2\\) relative to a \\(\\Sigma^b_1\\)-definition. Buss (1986) also showed that \\(\\mathsf{S}^i_2 \\subseteq \\mathsf{T}^i_2 \\subseteq \\mathsf{S}^{i+1}_2\\), that \\(\\mathsf{S}^i_2\\) and \\(\\mathsf{T}^i_2\\) are finitely axiomatizable, and that \\(\\mathsf{S}_2 = \\mathsf{T}_2\\). It is not known if either of the hierarchies of theories displayed above collapses or whether either \\(\\mathsf{S}_2\\) or \\(\\mathsf{T}_2\\) is finitely axiomatizable. However, either the existence of an \\(i\\) such that \\(\\mathsf{T}^i_2 = \\mathsf{S}^{i+1}_2\\) or the finite axiomatizability of \\(\\mathsf{S}_2\\) or \\(\\mathsf{T}_2\\) can be shown to entail the collapse of the Polynomial Hierarchy.\nThe second approach for relating formal arithmetic to \\(\\textbf{PH}\\) employs a series of second-order theories \\(\\mathsf{V}^0 \\subseteq \\mathsf{V}^1 \\subseteq \\ldots\\) originally introduced by Zambella (1996) (see also Cook and Kolokolova (2001) and Cook and Nguyen 2010). These extend the first-order language \\(\\mathcal{L}_a\\) with symbols \\(\\in\\) and \\(\\lvert \\cdot\\rvert\\) as well as the quantifiers \\(\\forall X\\) and \\(\\exists X\\) intended to range over finite sets of natural numbers. The theory \\(\\mathsf{V}^1\\) extends \\(\\mathsf{Q}\\) with second-order quantifier axioms, extensionality for sets, axioms formalizing that \\(\\lvert X\\rvert\\) is intended to denote the largest element of \\(X\\), and a second-order comprehension schema for \\(\\Sigma^B_1\\)-formulas \u2013 i.e. formulas containing only bounded first-order quantifiers and set quantifiers of the form \\(\\exists  X(\\lvert X\\rvert \\leq t)\\) (where \\(t\\) is a first-order term not containing \\(X\\)). In parallel to Theorem 4.7, it can be shown that a function \\(f(\\vec{x})\\) is in \\(\\textbf{FP}\\) just in case it is definable by a \\(\\Sigma^B_1\\)-formula relative to which it is provably total in \\(\\mathsf{V}^1\\). Similar characterizations of the classes \\(\\Box^P_i\\) may be obtained by considering the theories \\(\\mathsf{V}^i\\) (for \\(i > 1\\)) obtained by extending comprehension to wider classes of bounded second-order formulas.\n4.6 Strict finitism\nThe most direct links between philosophy of mathematics and computational complexity theory have thus far arisen in the context of discussions of the view traditionally known as strict finitism. This view is most prominently associated with Yessenin-Volpin (1961; 1970), who is in turn best known for questioning whether expressions such as \\(10^{12}\\) or \\(2^{50}\\) denote natural numbers. Presuming that such expressions denote at all, Yessenin-Volpin contended that they cannot be taken to describe what he referred to as feasible numbers \u2013 i.e. numbers up to which we may count in practice. On this basis, he outlined a foundational program wherein feasibility is treated as a basic notion and traditional arguments in favor of the validity of mathematical induction and the uniqueness of the natural number series are called into question. Antecedents for such a view may be found in (e.g.) Bernays (1935), van Dantzig (1955), and Wang (1958).[48]\nRecall that one tenet of the traditional form of finitism associated with the Hilbert Program is that the natural numbers should not be conceived as comprising a completed infinite totality. Strict finitists are sometimes described as going one step further than this and actively denying that there are infinitely many natural numbers. However, the following are more characteristic of claims which such theorists explicitly endorse:\n\n(S1)\n\nIt is possible to identify a class of natural numbers corresponding to those which can be constructed in practice by counting or whose values are otherwise explicitly representable as numerals, either concretely or in intuition.\n(S2)\n\nWe possess notations \u2013 e.g. decimal numerals such as \\(10^{10^{10}}, 67^{257^{729}}, 10^{12}\\) \u2013 which do not denote numbers in this class.\n\nIn emphasizing the practical aspects of how we use numerals to represent natural numbers in the course of performing arithmetical computations, it is evident that the concerns which motivate strict finitism anticipate some of those which also inspired the development of complexity theory. Nonetheless, strict finitism has attracted few followers. To see why this is so, observe that (S1) makes clear that strict finitists propose to identify natural numbers with numerals such as the familiar sequence \\(0,0',0'',\\ldots\\) of unary numerals.\nIf we regard such expressions as tokens rather than types, then it makes sense to consider the task of concretely \u2018counting up to\u2019 a number by \nconstructing its unary representation in the sense described by Yessenin-Volpin.  For recall that it is a characteristic feature of numerals that they may be generated from certain initial symbols by the application of a finite set of syntactic formation rules \u2013 e.g. the unary numerals are generated by applying the formation rule \\(\\sigma \\mapsto \\sigma'\\) to the initial symbol \\(0\\). But once this is acknowledged, it also seems difficult to resist the following additional thesis:\n\n(S3)\n\nIf a numeral \\(\\sigma\\) can be feasibly constructed, then so can \\(\\sigma'\\) (i.e. the unary numeral denoting the successor of the number denoted by \\(\\sigma\\)).[49]\n\nIn attempting to accommodate (S1)\u2013(S3) simultaneously, we must confront a tension which has led many authors to follow Dummett (1975) in concluding that strict finitism lacks a coherent formulation. For suppose we let \\(F(x)\\) symbolize that \\(x\\) denotes a feasible number in Yessenin-Volpin\u2019s sense. Then it would seem to follow from (S1) that we ought to accept\n\n\\(F(0)\\)\n\nBut it would also seem to follow from (S3) that we should also accept\n\n\\(\\forall x(F(x) \\rightarrow F(x+1))\\)\n\nand from (S2) that we should accept\n\n\\(\\neg F(\\tau)\\)\n\nwhere \\(\\tau\\) is an expression denoting an \u2018infeasible number\u2019 such as  \\(10^{12}\\), \\(10^{10^{10}}\\) or \\(67^{257^{729}}\\).\nDummett observed that two different forms of the classical sorites paradox now intervene to show that (i)\u2013(iii) are inconsistent. For on the one hand, by applying mathematical induction \u2013 i.e. the principle that for all definite properties \\(P(x)\\) of natural numbers, we may infer \\(\\forall x P(x)\\) from \\(P(0)\\) and \\(\\forall x(P(x) \\rightarrow P(x+1))\\) \u2013 to the predicate \\(F(x)\\), we may conclude that \\(\\forall x F(x)\\) from (i) and (ii). But then \\(F(\\tau)\\) follows by universal instantiation, in contradiction to (iii). And on the other hand, even without appealing to induction, a contradiction can also be derived in the form of a conditional sorites argument by deriving \\(F(\\tau)\\) as the result of repeatedly applying modus ponens to the series \\(F(0), F(0) \\rightarrow F(0'), F(0') \\rightarrow F(0''), \\ldots\\) obtained from (ii) by universal instantiation.\nAlthough it would be uncharitable to think that Yessenin-Volpin was unaware of these observations, the first person to directly reply to the charge that (S1)-(S3) are inconsistent appears to have been Parikh (1971).[50] His response can be understood as consisting of two parts, both of which bear on the analysis of the informal notion of feasibility considered in Sections \n 1.1 and \n 2.2. \n On the one hand, Parikh considers what he refers to as the almost consistent theory \\(\\mathsf{PA}^F\\). This theory is formulated over the language \\(\\mathcal{L}_a \\cup \\{F(x)\\}\\) supplemented with terms for all closed primitive recursive functions and contains the statement \\(\\neg F(\\tau)\\) where \\(\\tau\\) is some fixed primitive recursive term intended to denote an \u2018infeasible\u2019 number such as \\(10^{12}\\). Finally, \\(\\mathsf{PA}^F\\) contains the axioms of \\(\\mathsf{PA}\\) with the induction schema restricted to formulas not containing \\(F(x)\\).\nIn light of the latter restriction, it is not possible to mimic the inductive form of the sorites argument in \\(\\mathsf{PA}^F\\). But of course \\(\\mathsf{PA}^F\\) is still inconsistent in virtue of the conditional form of the argument. Nonetheless, Parikh showed that for appropriate choices of \\(\\tau\\), any proof of a contradiction in \\(\\mathsf{PA}^F\\) must itself be very long.  For instance, if we consider the super-exponential function \\(2 \\Uparrow 0 = 1\\) and \\(2 \\Uparrow (x+1) = 2^{2 \\Uparrow x}\\) and let \\(\\tau\\) be the primitive recursive term \\(2 \\Uparrow 2^k\\), it is a consequence of Parikh\u2019s result that any proof of a contradiction in \\(\\mathsf{PA}^F\\) must be on the order of \\(2^k\\) steps long. For example if \\(\\tau = 2 \\Uparrow 2^{1000}\\), then such a proof must be at least \\(2^{1000}\\) lines \n long.[51] \nThis suggests the possibility of a two-part reply on behalf of the strict finitist to Dummett\u2019s argument against strict \n finitism:[52]\n\n\nThe inductive form of the sorites is ruled out in virtue of the fact that \\(F(x)\\) is not a definite (i.e. non-vague) property of natural numbers.\n\nAt least for certain choices of \\(\\tau\\), the conditional form is also not a threat because the only derivation of a contradiction from (i)\u2013(iii) is too long to be carried out in practice.\n\nThe possibility of such a reply notwithstanding, it is also natural to ask at this point whether the notion of feasibility considered in complexity theory might also be vague in a manner which could render it susceptible to the sort of soritical argument envisioned by Dummett (1975). Note, however, that our discussion thus far suggests that the notion of feasibility in which strict finitists have been interested is a property of individual natural numbers. This is out of keeping with the way we have seen that this notion is treated in complexity theory. For instance, in order to employ the Cobham-Edmond\u2019s Thesis to judge whether a problem \\(X\\) is feasibly decidable, we consider the order of growth of the time complexity \\(t(n)\\) of the most efficient algorithm for deciding \\(X\\). From the perspective of complexity theory, feasibility is thus a notion which applies not to individual natural numbers \\(n\\), but either to time complexity functions of type \\(\\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}\\) or their rates of growth.\nNext observe that the following are consequences of the Cobham-Edmonds thesis:\n\n\n\\(O(1)\\) (i.e. constant time) is a feasible rate of growth.\n\nSince all polynomial orders of growth are feasible, it follows that if \\(O(n^k)\\) is feasible, then so is \\(O(n^{k+1})\\).\n\nSuper-polynomial orders of growth such as \\(O(2^n)\\) are not feasible.\n\nOn this basis one might indeed fear that the intuitions about feasibly computable functions codified by the Cobham-Edmonds thesis exhibit the same kind of instability as do intuitively acceptable principles about feasibly constructible numbers.\nTo see that this is not the case, however, observe that we compare the growth rates of \\(f,g: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}\\) not by the standard ordering \\(\\lt\\) on the natural numbers but rather the following ordering \\(\\prec\\):\n\n\\[\n O(f(n)) \\prec O(g(n)) \\text{ if and only if there exists } \n n_0,c \\in \\mathbb{N} \\text{ such that for all } \n n \\gt n_0, f(n) \\lt c \\cdot g(n)\n\\]\n\nIt is a consequence of this definition that \\(O(1) \\prec O(n) \\prec O(n^2) \\prec O(n^3) \\ldots\\) \u2013 i.e. the polynomial orders of growth do form an \\(\\omega\\)-sequence with respect to \\(\\prec\\). However, it also follows that \\(O(n^k) \\prec O(2^n)\\) for all \\(k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) \u2013 i.e. \\(O(2^n)\\) is a \u2018point at infinity\u2019 sitting above each polynomial order of growth with respect to this ordering (as are all other super-polynomial rates of growth).[53] And from this it follows that such orders cannot be reached from below by a sorties-like sequence of feasible orders of growth \\(O(1) \\prec O(n) \\prec O(n^2) \\prec O(n^3) \\ldots\\) When analyzed according to the Cobham-Edmonds thesis, it hence appears that the \u2018naive\u2019 notion of feasible computability does not suffer from the sort of instability which Dummett takes to plague the notion of a feasibly constructible number.\nThese observations point to another theme within the writings of some strict finitists which suggests that they also anticipate the way in which predicates like \u2018feasible\u2019 and \u2018infeasible\u2019 are now employed in complexity theory. For instance, while van Dantzig (1955) suggests that the feasible numbers are closed under addition and multiplication, Yessenin-Volpin (1970) explicitly states that they should not be regarded as closed under exponentiation. The possibility that exponentiation should be understood to play a role in the formulation of strict finitism itself is also suggested by the fact that the particular examples of \u2018infeasible numbers\u2019 which have been put forth by Yessenin-Volpin and others have typically employed exponential or iterated exponential notations of the forms such as \\(n_1^{{n}_2}\\) or \\(n_1^{n_2^{n_3}}\\). This in turn suggests another reply to the sorties-based argument against strict finitism.\nRecall that the theory \\(\\text{I}\\Delta_0\\) introduced in \n Section 4.5 \n allows us to define the graph of the exponential function \\(x^y\\) via a \\(\\Delta_0\\)-formula \\(\\varepsilon(x,y,z)\\) in the sense that \\(\\text{I}\\Delta_0 \\vdash \\forall x\\varepsilon(x,0,1)\\) and \\(\\text{I}\\Delta_0 \\vdash \\forall x \\forall y \\forall z(\\varepsilon(x,y,z) \\rightarrow \\varepsilon(x,y+1,z \\cdot x))\\). But as we have seen, \\(\\text{I}\\Delta_0\\) does not prove the totality of the exponential function nor (as can be also be shown) does Buss\u2019s theory \\(\\mathsf{S}^1_2\\). From this it follows that the theory \\(\\mathsf{S}^1_2 + \\exists y \\neg \\exists z \\varepsilon(2,y,z)\\) is proof-theoretically consistent. By the completeness theorem for first-order logic, there thus exists a model \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) for the language of bounded of arithmetic such that \\(\\mathcal{M} \\models \\mathsf{S}^1_2 + \\exists y \\neg \\exists z \\varepsilon(2,y,z)\\). But although it follows from Theorem 4.5 that all the polynomial time computable functions are defined for all inputs in \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), there also exists an object \\(a\\) in the domain of \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) satisfying \\(\\neg \\exists z \\varepsilon(2,a,z)\\). And from this it follows that the expression we would conventionally write as \u2018\\(2^a\\)\u2019 fails to denote a value in \\(\\mathcal{M}\\).[54]\nOf course any model \\(\\mathcal{M} \\models \\mathsf{S}^1_2 + \\exists y \\neg \\exists z \\varepsilon(2,y,z)\\) must be nonstandard. Thus not only must the domain of \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) be infinite, but also there will exist \u2018natural numbers\u2019 in the sense of \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) which will have infinitely many predecessors when viewed from the outside of \\(\\mathcal{M}\\). One might thus at first think that the use of structures like \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) to explore the consequences of strict finitism would be antithetical to its proponents.\nNote, however, that such theorists are typically careful to avoid explicitly asserting that there are only finitely many feasible numbers. Instead they give examples of expressions whose denotations (were they to exist) would be infeasibly large \u2013 e.g. those given in the formulation of (S2). Certainly the claim that there is a largest feasibly constructible number would invite the challenge that the strict finitist nominate such a number \\(n\\). And any such nomination would in turn invite the rejoinder that if \\(n\\) is feasibly constructible, then \\(n+1\\) must be as well. But in the sort of model \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) under consideration the definite description \u2018the largest \\(x\\) such that \\(2^x\\) exists\u2019 will be non-denoting in virtue of the fact that the elements \\(n \\in \\mathcal{M}\\) such that \\(\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists z \\varepsilon(2,n,z)\\) form a proper initial segment. The existence of such models might thus be taken to elucidate Yessenin-Volpin\u2019s (1970) claim that there are distinct natural number sequences which are distinguished by the primitive recursive functions under which they are closed.[55]\n4.7 Logical knowledge and the complexity of deductive reasoning\nThe most direct links between complexity theory and epistemology which have thus far been discussed are mediated by the observation that deciding logical validity (and related properties) is generally a computationally difficult task. For on the one hand, a traditional view in epistemology is that logical knowledge \u2013 e.g. knowledge that certain statements are logical validities \u2013 is a paradigm case of a priori knowledge. If this is correct, then it would seem that we should credit normal epistemic agents with knowledge of the class of logically valid sentences of systems such as propositional and first-order logic which are commonly taken to underlie everyday reasoning. But on the other hand, the results presented in \n Section 4.2  make clear that the problem of deciding whether \\(\\phi\\) is a validity of one of these systems is computationally intractable.\nThe apparent clash between philosophical views about knowledge which predict that logical validities ought to be easy to come to know (e.g. in virtue of the fact that they do not require empirical confirmation) and the technical fact that the validity and satisfiability problems for even the weakest familiar systems are intractable is the origin of two developments which traditionally have been of interest to epistemologists: the problem of logical omniscience and the study of theories of minimal or bounded rationality.\nThe problem of logical omniscience is often presented as having originated from within the subject known as epistemic logic. In this setting, knowledge is treated as a modal operator \\(K_i\\) where sentences of the form \\(K_i \\phi\\) are assigned the intended interpretation agent \\(i\\) knows that \\(\\phi\\). The goal is to then set down axioms and rules which characterize how we should reason about statements of this form. For instance the principle that knowledge of a statement entails its truth is rendered as \\(K_i \\phi \\rightarrow \\phi\\) and the principle that knowledge of a conjunction entails knowledge of its conjuncts is rendered as \\(K_i(\\phi \\wedge \\psi) \\rightarrow (K_i \\phi \\wedge K_i \\psi)\\). Other principles \u2013 e.g. \\(\\neg K_i \\phi \\rightarrow K_i \\neg K_i \\phi\\), which expresses that \\(i\\)\u2019s failure to know \\(\\phi\\) entails that he knows of this failure \u2013 are considered more controversial. However the consensus view (e.g., Hintikka 1962; Lenzen 1978; Fagin et al. 1995) is that the most defensible choices of logics of knowledge lie between the modal systems \\(\\textsf{S4}\\) and \\(\\textsf{S5}\\).\nThe precise axiomatization which is adopted for \\(K_i\\) notwithstanding, the use of modal logic to model reasoning about knowledge has the following two consequences:\n\n\n\\(K_i \\phi\\) for all \\(\\phi \\in \\sc{VALID}\\)\n\nif \\(\\Gamma \\models \\phi\\) and \\(K_i \\psi\\) for all \\(\\psi \\in \\Gamma\\), then \\(K_i \\phi\\)\n\n(i) and (ii) respectively report that an agent\u2019s knowledge includes all propositional tautologies and that the set of sentences he knows is closed under logical consequence.[56] Note, however, that both of these results seem prima facie implausible relative to our everyday understanding of knowledge. For on the one hand, not only are there infinitely many distinct propositional tautologies, but there are even relatively short ones which many otherwise normal epistemic agents will fail to recognize as such. And on the other, it is generally acknowledged that the set of sentences which we know or believe (at least in an explicit sense) is not closed under logical consequence. This is often illustrated by observing that an otherwise competent epistemic agent might know the axioms of a mathematical theory (e.g. \\(\\mathsf{PA}\\)) without knowing all of its theorems (e.g. the Infinitude of Primes).\nThe results summarized in Sections \n 4.2 and \n 4.3 underscore just how severe these problems are. Note first that the problem of deciding whether a given formula is a tautology is \\(\\textbf{coNP}\\)-complete, and hence very likely to be intractable. But we have also seen that results from proof complexity strongly suggest that any proof system which an agent is likely to adopt for reasoning about propositional logic (e.g. natural deduction) will be such that there are infinitely many statements whose simplest proofs are of length at least exponential relative to their size. It is thus likely that there will exist \u2018short\u2019 tautologies \u2013 e.g. with fewer than 100 propositional letters \u2013 whose shortest proof in a conventional natural deduction system will be astronomically long. Similar remarks apply to the problem of determining whether a finite set of sentences \\(\\{\\psi_1, \\ldots, \\psi_n\\}\\) is consistent \u2013 a task which is surely of epistemic import in everyday reasoning. In particular, it is readily seen that consistency checking is simply a re-description of the canonical \\(\\textbf{NP}\\)-complete problem \\(\\sc{SAT}\\).\nIt is already a consequence of the Cobham-Edmonds Thesis (together with the expected positive answers to Open Questions 1 and 2) that such problems are computationally intractable. But if we abandon the simplifying assumption that everyday reasoning is based on classical propositional logic, then validity and consistency checking only become harder. For instance, if we think that agents can reason about their own knowledge or that of others using a modal logic such as \\(\\mathsf{S4}\\) or \\(\\mathsf{S5}_2\\), then the corresponding validity and satisfiability problems become \\(\\textbf{PSPACE}\\)-complete. And if we assume that they reason in propositional relevance logic, classical first-order logic, or intuitionistic first-order logic, then the validity problem becomes \\(\\textbf{RE}\\)-complete (i.e. as hard as the Halting Problem).\nOne common reaction to these observations is to acknowledge that as plausible as the axioms of traditional epistemic logics may appear, they formalize not our everyday understanding of knowledge but rather an idealized or \u2018implicit\u2019 notion more closely resembling \u2018knowability in principle\u2019 (e.g. Levesque 1984; Stalnaker 1991; 1999). Another reaction has been to attempt to modify the interpretation of the language of epistemic logic to mitigate the effects of (i) and (ii). This can be achieved by altering the account of semantic validity for the modal language in question \u2013 e.g. through the use of so-called impossible worlds (Rantala 1982), awareness models (Fagin and Halpern 1988), or local models (Fagin and Halpern 1988). But although these techniques can be used to circumvent particular cases of (i) and (ii), they also typically complicate the task of explaining why the set of sentences known by an agent may exhibit some potentially desirable closure properties (e.g. that knowledge of a conjunction entails knowledge of its conjuncts).\nAn approach to logical omniscience which explicitly takes computational complexity into account is proposed by Artemov and Kuznets (2014). They suggest that a logic of knowledge should formalize not just statements of the form \u2018\\(\\phi\\) is knowable by agent \\(i\\)\u2019 but also ones of the form \u2018\\(\\phi\\) is known by agent \\(i\\) on the basis of evidence \\(t\\)\u2019. They then exhibit a family of Justification Logics for reasoning about statements of the latter form which satisfy the so-called Strong Logical Omniscience Test \u2013 i.e. if a statement of the form \u2018\\(\\phi\\) is known by agent \\(i\\) on the basis of evidence \\(t\\)\u2019 is derivable, then a proof of \\(\\phi\\) can be found in time polynomial in the size of \\(t\\) and \\(\\phi\\).\nThe foregoing modifications to epistemic logic fall broadly within the scope of the subject which has come to be known as bounded rationality \u2013 c.f., e.g., (Simon 1957; Simon 1972; Rubinstein 1998; Gigerenzer and Selten 2002; Kahneman 2003). This development can be traced to work in decision theory and cognitive psychology which attempts to take into account that human agents face resource limitations in everyday decision making. The attempt to develop models of decision which take resource limitations into account is sometimes presented as a counterpoint to the normative models of rational choice which are often employed in economics and political science. In this context, decision making is often modeled as a form of optimization. In particular, it is traditionally required that fully rational agents be able to find an optimal choice among an array of alternatives,  the potential infeasibility of carrying out a search amongst them notwithstanding.\nThese developments serve as part of the background to a debate in epistemology which originated with Cherniak\u2019s (1981; 1984; 1986) theory of minimal rationality. Cherniak attempts to provide a characterization of rationality which is responsive to both traditional normative characterizations as well as complexity theoretic results about the difficulty of deductive inference of the sort discussed above. According to his account, a minimally rational agent need only make some of the valid inferences which follow from his beliefs in a proof system for classical logic. He further suggests that the inferences which are selected may depend on the sorts of heuristics considered by cognitive psychologists such as Tversky and Kahneman (1974). As such, Cherniak proposes that the use of heuristics which may be of benefit to an agent in certain circumstances \u2013 even potentially unsound ones \u2013 should be regarded as falling under a generalized account of rationality informed by computational complexity theory. Related themes are discussed by Harman (1986) and Morton (2004; 2012).\n5. Further reading\nHistorical surveys of the early development of computational complexity theory by the Western and Soviet schools are respectively provided in (Fortnow and Homer 2003) and (Trakhtenbrot 1984). (Wagner and Wechsung 1986) and (Emde Boas 1990) provide detailed treatments of machine models, simulation results, the status of the Invariance Thesis, and the distinction between the first and second machine classes. Basic topics in complexity theory are presented in semi-popular form in (Allender and McCartin 2000), (Harel 2006), (Cook 2012), and (Fortnow 2013). Introductory presentations can also be found in many general undergraduate textbooks on theoretical computer science such as (Hopcroft and Ulman 1979), (Lewis and Papadimitriou 1998), and (Sipser 2006). More advanced textbook treatments of complexity theory include (Papadimitriou 1994), (Du and Ko 2000), (Hemaspaandra and Ogihara 2002), (Arora and Barak 2009), and (Goldreich 2010). Many of these books cover topics which are not surveyed here but which may be of interest to philosophers \u2013 e.g. randomized algorithms, probabilistically checkable proofs, natural proofs, zero-knowledge proofs, and interactive proof systems. (Van Leeuwen 1990) contains survey articles on several complexity-related topics. The standard reference on \\(\\textbf{NP}\\)-completeness remains (Garey and Johnson 1979) which contains a list of over 300 \\(\\textbf{NP}\\)-complete problems. A similar reference on \\(\\textbf{P}\\)-completeness is (Greenlaw, Hoover, and Ruzzo 1995). Structural complexity theory \u2013 i.e. the study of different reduction notions and the corresponding degree structures \u2013 is developed in (Balc\u00e1zar, Diaz, and Gabarr\u00f3 1988) and (Odifreddi 1999). Textbook treatments of proof complexity, descriptive complexity, and bounded arithmetic are respectively provided by (Cook and Nguyen 2010), (Immerman 1999), and (H\u00e1jek and Pudl\u00e1k 1998). (Moore and Mertens 2011) and (Aaronson 2013b) also provide recent philosophically-oriented surveys of complexity theory.",
