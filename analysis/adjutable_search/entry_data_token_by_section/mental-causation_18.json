    "main_text": "Problem III: Exclusion || Autonomy Solutions\n6.3 Autonomy Solutions\n\nThe Exclusion Problem presents us with a picture on which higher-level\nmental properties compete with their lower-level physical realizers.\nPhysical properties are unproblematically relevant in the production\nof behavior, and so mental properties must either find a way to do the\nwork that their realizers are already doing or face exclusion. But\nsome philosophers would insist that this picture is deeply misleading:\nmental properties enjoy causal relevance in their own right and are\nnot threatened by exclusion from physical properties.\n\nThis \u201cautonomy solution\u201d (Jackson 1996, \u00a72) can take\na variety of forms. One version starts by observing that psychological\nexplanations\u2014and more generally, explanations in the special\nsciences\u2014are in an important sense independent of physical\nexplanations. Psychological explanations typically abstract away from\ndetails of lower-level implementation, appealing instead to their own\ndistinctive kinds and laws. Explanations in the special sciences can\nthus proceed independently of those in the lower-level physical\nsciences. If the structure of the causal order reflects these\nexplanatory practices, mental properties need not be threatened by\nexclusion. Mental and physical causes can peacefully coexist.\n(Variations on this theme appear in Dennett 1973; Baker 1993; Van\nGulick 1993; Garrett 1998; Hardcastle 1998; Marcus 2001; Menzies 2003;\nRaymont 2003; Ross and Spurrett 2004; Woodward 2008; Zhong 2014; see\nalso \u00a77.5.)\n\nThis appeal to explanation can naturally lead to (though it does not\nentail) another autonomy solution, the dual explanandum\nstrategy. The Exclusion Problem presents a mental (functional)\nproperty M and its physical realizer P as competing\nto be causally relevant to the same effect, namely a bit of behavior.\nBut M might not be threatened with exclusion if M\nand P are causally relevant to different properties of the\neffect. Return for a moment to the paperweight example from \u00a73.\nThe shape of the paperweight is relevant, not to the impression\nsimpliciter, but to the impression\u2019s shape. In\ngeneral, a causally relevant property is relevant to some particular\nproperty of the effect (Horgan 1989). Perhaps, then, M and\nP do not causally compete because they are parts of separate,\nautonomous causal lines to different properties of the effect.\n\nConsider one way this might work. Behavioral properties, just like\nmental properties, appear to be multiply realizable. For example,\nthere is more than one way to hail a cab, many different physical\nrealizations of this kind of behavior. Now suppose a belief causes you\nto hail a cab. In accordance with Completeness, some physical\nproperty P of the belief is sufficient for your behavior. But\nstrictly speaking, P is relevant only to the particular\nway in which you hailed the cab, the particular physical\nrealization of your hailing. What, then, is responsible for your\nbehavior\u2019s higher-level property of simply being a\ncab-hailing? It\u2019s natural to suppose that it\u2019s a\nhigher-level property of your belief, namely, some mental property,\nsuch as the belief\u2019s representational content. (For proposals\nalong these lines, see Yablo 1992; Thomasson 1998; Marras 1998; Crisp\nand Warfield 2001; Gibbons 2006; Schlosser 2009; see also\n\u00a7\u00a77.3\u20134.)\n\nA strength of autonomy solutions is that they secure a causal role for\nmental properties without running afoul of Completeness, as\nthe physical realization of behavior is always matched with some\nphysical properties of its cause. But do autonomy solutions respect\nNo Overdetermination? Here matters are not as\nstraightforward. Autonomy solutions present us with two properties,\nP and M, each sufficient for the behavioral effect.\nIt might seem as if the dual explanandum strategy avoids this\nawkwardness, since P and M are relevant to different\nproperties of the effect. But even here, overdetermination threatens,\nas the effect\u2019s behavioral property is produced twice: directly\nby M, and indirectly by P, which produces the\nbehavioral property\u2019s physical realizer, which itself\nnecessitates the behavioral property.\n\nProponents of autonomy solutions might grant these points but claim\nthat such \u201coverdetermination\u201d is innocuous, far from the\n\u201cintolerable coincidence\u201d threatening Cartesian dualist\naccounts of mental causation (\u00a72.4), for the two causal lines\npresent are not independent. (The nature of overdetermination has\nitself become the subject of a literature inspired, in part, by the\nExclusion Problem. See, e.g., Funkhouser 2002; Bennett 2003; Sider\n2003; Walter 2008; Carey 2011; Bernstein 2016; Kroedel 2019.)\n",
