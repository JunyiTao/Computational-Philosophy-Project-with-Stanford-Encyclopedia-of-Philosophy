In World and the Individual he wrote: \u201cAt any\nmoment your ideas, in so far as they are rational, embody a\npurpose\u201d (1900, 441\u20132). \u201cAnd so,\u201d he said\nelsewhere, \u201cthe empirical world is a whole, a life fulfilling\nthe purposes of our ideas. It is that or it is nothing\u201d (1900,\n368). The logic that Royce proposed is therefore a logic of action\nwhere actions are taken as purposive.\n\nAs an ontological starting point, modes of action should be understood\nas \u201cgeneral\u201d terms, in the sense proposed by C. S. Peirce.\nGenerals, for Peirce, are like habits in that they specify a general\nstate of affairs that can be realized in multiple different ways\n(Peirce, 1931, 2:148). Generals stand in contrast to universals. While\nuniversals are deductively complete categories, generals are emergent\ncategories where some particulars fit closely to the features\nspecified by the general concept and others less so. The category of\noak tree, for example, can be realized by a wide range of particular\noak trees from tall, full trees, to small, stunted trees, to trees\nbroken by ice and wind. Each is, in a general sense, an oak tree, but\neach realizes the concept in a particular way. The concept of species\nis likewise general in that a species includes marginal cases that are\nnot clearly in the category or clearly out of it. While it is tempting\n(especially in the case of terms that are defined in a particular\nfield of inquiry) to suppose that categories are the nominal\nconstructs of inquirers, Peirce argued that generals are themselves\nreal (not nominal), so that natural kinds or categories are the\nproducts of evolving and intersecting activities, and as such are as\nmuch discovered as they are created for purposes of inquiry (Peirce,\n8:12; Mayorga, 2007).\n\nModes of action are similarly general. Talk about the relation between\nactions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is talk about\nthe relation between two general ways of acting. When \\(A\\)\nis actually taken, then it is a particular token of\nthe type of action \\(A\\) and it stands in a distinctive\nrelation with other modes of action with which it is compatible and\nstill other modes of action with which it is not. By framing his logic\nas a logic of modes of action, Royce could include both categories of\ncommonly understood actions (walking, talking, reading, judging), but\nwas also able to include any sort of persistent being by seeing a\nbeing as a process involving distinctive characteristic actions in\nrelation to general categories or modes of action. An apple is a thing\nthat acts like an apple; a mountain is a thing that acts like a\nmountain; a fine pinot noir is thing that acts like a fine pinot noir.\nThe power of this approach is that the objects of logic are\nnecessarily understood as ongoing activities that both close off\npossibilities and open new ones with each action.\n3.1.2 Fundamental Operations\n\nThe primary operation in Royce\u2019s logic is the exclusive\n disjunction[6],\n an operation or possible operation that divides actions into two\n\u201cobverse\u201d or incompatible categories where if one action\nfrom a category is taken, it eliminates the possibility of taking an\naction in the other. For example, an exclusive disjunction is present\nwhen an agent selects a candidate on a ballot. To select the candidate\nis to lose the option to choose another or to simply opt out of\nvoting. Put another way, actions are exclusively related when they are\nincompatible, that is, they cannot be taken together. Royce\u2019s\nlogic is founded on the relation that expresses the operation of\njudgment, that is, the selection by an agent of one alternative over\nanother where the alternatives are incompatible. System \\(\\Sigma\\) is\na logic of modes of action and a logic of agency.\n\nExclusively-related actions also introduce the operation of\nnegation. When an action is negated, it is not taken (or is\nexcluded from the possibility of being taken). So, if action \\(A\\)\nand action \\(B\\) are related by\nexclusive disjunction, then if action \\(A\\) is taken,\naction \\(B\\) is negated, \\(\\neg B\\).\n\nThe exclusive relation that holds between incompatible actions also\nprovides a context for Royce\u2019s notion of equivalence\n(Royce 1905, 391). An action, \\(A\\), is logically\nequivalent to another action, \\(B\\), if and only if\nthey are compatible (one can be taken without excluding the other).\nSo, for example, if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are\ncompatible and \\(B\\) and \\(\\neg B\\) are incompatible,\nthen \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg B\\) are also incompatible. If so,\nthen \\(A = B\\). In the case of voting just mentioned, the three-term\nrelation (voting for candidate \\(M\\), voting for\nsomeone else, and not voting at all) are together incompatible. If we\nconsider the first option, voting for \\(M\\), then the\nother two options are equivalent because they equally eliminate voting\nfor \\(M\\) if one or the other is taken. Equivalence\nthen is relative to compatibility in a given situation defined by a\nset of incompatible or \u201cobverse\u201d possibilities.\n\nExclusive disjunction and equivalence suggest two other basic\nrelations among actions: symmetry and asymmetry (Royce 1905,\n379\u2013385; 1913a, 97\u2013100). Exclusive disjunctions are\nsymmetrical in that their order in relation to the disjunctive terms\ndoes not matter. That is, if \\(A\\) or \\(\\neg A\\) is an\nexclusive disjunction, then \\(\\neg A\\) or \\(A\\) is\nalso. Equivalence is also symmetrical in that if \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) are equivalent, then \\(B\\) and\n\\(A\\) are also equivalent. In either case, the actions\nare not ordered with respect to each other. When actions are ordered\nsuch that \\(A\\) is antecedent to \\(B\\)\n(or vice versa), then the relation is asymmetrical.\n\nIn general, the process of ordering is a twofold transformation.\nPossibilities of action emerge as symmetrical exclusive disjunctions\nand are transformed into asymmetrical relations such that one action\nis antecedent to the other. If \\(A\\) or \\(B\\)\nis an exclusive disjunction, then taking action \\(A\\)\nresults in the negation of action \\(B\\),\nsuch that \\(\\neg B\\) is a consequence of the\nantecedent taking of \\(A\\). The symmetrical exclusive\ndisjunction is transformed by the action of an agent into the\nasymmetrical antecedent/consequent relation.\n",
