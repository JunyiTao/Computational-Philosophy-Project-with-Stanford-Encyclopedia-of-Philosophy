Statistical methods for hypothesis testing\n\nDespite the many difficulties that philosophers encountered in trying\nto providing a clear methodology of conformation (or refutation),\nstill important progress has been made on understanding how\nobservation can provide evidence for a given theory. Work in\nstatistics has been crucial for understanding how theories can be\ntested empirically, and in recent decades a huge literature has\ndeveloped that attempts to recast confirmation in Bayesian terms. Here\nthese developments can be covered only briefly, and we refer to the\nentry on\n confirmation\n for further details and references.\n\nStatistics has come to play an increasingly important role in the\nmethodology of the experimental sciences from the 19th\ncentury onwards. At that time, statistics and probability theory took\non a methodological role as an analysis of inductive inference, and\nattempts to ground the rationality of induction in the axioms of\nprobability theory have continued throughout the 20th\ncentury and in to the present. Developments in the theory of\nstatistics itself, meanwhile, have had a direct and immense influence\non the experimental method, including methods for measuring the\nuncertainty of observations such as the Method of Least Squares\ndeveloped by Legendre and Gauss in the early 19th century,\ncriteria for the rejection of outliers proposed by Peirce by the\nmid-19th century, and the significance tests developed by\nGosset (a.k.a. \u201cStudent\u201d), Fisher, Neyman & Pearson\nand others in the 1920s and 1930s (see, e.g., Swijtink 1987 for a\nbrief historical overview; and also the entry on\n C.S. Peirce).\n\nThese developments within statistics then in turn led to a reflective\ndiscussion among both statisticians and philosophers of science on how\nto perceive the process of hypothesis testing: whether it was a\nrigorous statistical inference that could provide a numerical\nexpression of the degree of confidence in the tested hypothesis, or if\nit should be seen as a decision between different courses of actions\nthat also involved a value component. This led to a major controversy\namong Fisher on the one side and Neyman and Pearson on the other (see\nespecially Fisher 1955, Neyman 1956 and Pearson 1955, and for analyses\nof the controversy, e.g., Howie 2002, Marks 2000, Lenhard 2006). On\nFisher\u2019s view, hypothesis testing was a methodology for when to\naccept or reject a statistical hypothesis, namely that a hypothesis\nshould be rejected by evidence if this evidence would be unlikely\nrelative to other possible outcomes, given the hypothesis were true.\nIn contrast, on Neyman and Pearson\u2019s view, the consequence of\nerror also had to play a role when deciding between hypotheses.\nIntroducing the distinction between the error of rejecting a true\nhypothesis (type I error) and accepting a false hypothesis (type II\nerror), they argued that it depends on the consequences of the error\nto decide whether it is more important to avoid rejecting a true\nhypothesis or accepting a false one. Hence, Fisher aimed for a theory\nof inductive inference that enabled a numerical expression of\nconfidence in a hypothesis. To him, the important point was the search\nfor truth, not utility. In contrast, the Neyman-Pearson approach\nprovided a strategy of inductive behaviour for deciding between\ndifferent courses of action. Here, the important point was not whether\na hypothesis was true, but whether one should act as if it was.\n\nSimilar discussions are found in the philosophical literature. On the\none side, Churchman (1948) and Rudner (1953) argued that because\nscientific hypotheses can never be completely verified, a complete\nanalysis of the methods of scientific inference includes ethical\njudgments in which the scientists must decide whether the evidence is\nsufficiently strong or that the probability is sufficiently high to\nwarrant the acceptance of the hypothesis, which again will depend on\nthe importance of making a mistake in accepting or rejecting the\nhypothesis. Others, such as Jeffrey (1956) and Levi (1960) disagreed\nand instead defended a value-neutral view of science on which\nscientists should bracket their attitudes, preferences, temperament,\nand values when assessing the correctness of their inferences. For\nmore details on this value-free ideal in the philosophy of science and\nits historical development, see Douglas (2009) and Howard (2003). For\na broad set of case studies examining the role of values in science,\nsee e.g. Elliott & Richards 2017.\n\nIn recent decades, philosophical discussions of the evaluation of\nprobabilistic hypotheses by statistical inference have largely focused\non Bayesianism that understands probability as a measure of a\nperson\u2019s degree of belief in an event, given the available\ninformation, and frequentism that instead understands probability as a\nlong-run frequency of a repeatable event. Hence, for Bayesians\nprobabilities refer to a state of knowledge, whereas for frequentists\nprobabilities refer to frequencies of events (see, e.g., Sober 2008,\nchapter 1 for a detailed introduction to Bayesianism and frequentism\nas well as to likelihoodism). Bayesianism aims at providing a\nquantifiable, algorithmic representation of belief revision, where\nbelief revision is a function of prior beliefs (i.e., background\nknowledge) and incoming evidence. Bayesianism employs a rule based on\nBayes\u2019 theorem, a theorem of the probability calculus which\nrelates conditional probabilities. The probability that a particular\nhypothesis is true is interpreted as a degree of belief, or credence,\nof the scientist. There will also be a probability and a degree of\nbelief that a hypothesis will be true conditional on a piece of\nevidence (an observation, say) being true. Bayesianism proscribes that\nit is rational for the scientist to update their belief in the\nhypothesis to that conditional probability should it turn out that the\nevidence is, in fact, observed (see, e.g., Sprenger & Hartmann\n2019 for a comprehensive treatment of Bayesian philosophy of science).\nOriginating in the work of Neyman and Person, frequentism aims at\nproviding the tools for reducing long-run error rates, such as the\nerror-statistical approach developed by Mayo (1996) that focuses on\nhow experimenters can avoid both type I and type II errors by building\nup a repertoire of procedures that detect errors if and only if they\nare present. Both Bayesianism and frequentism have developed over\ntime, they are interpreted in different ways by its various\nproponents, and their relations to previous criticism to attempts at\ndefining scientific method are seen differently by proponents and\ncritics. The literature, surveys, reviews and criticism in this area\nare vast and the reader is referred to the entries on\n Bayesian epistemology\n and\n confirmation.\n",
