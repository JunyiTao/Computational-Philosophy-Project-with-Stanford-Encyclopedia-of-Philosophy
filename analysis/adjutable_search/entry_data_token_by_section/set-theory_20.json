    "main_text": "Large cardinals || Consequences of large cardinals\n11. Forcing axioms\n\nForcing axioms are axioms of set theory that assert that certain\nexistential statements are absolute between the universe \\(V\\) of all\nsets and its (ideal) forcing extensions, i.e., some existential\nstatements that hold in some forcing extensions of \\(V\\) are already\ntrue in \\(V\\). The first forcing axiom was formulated by Donald Martin\nin the wake of the Solovay-Tennenbaum proof of the consistency of\nSuslin\u2019s Hypothesis, and is now known as Martin\u2019s\nAxiom (MA). Before we state it, let us say that a partial\nordering is a non-empty set \\(P\\) together with a binary relation\n\\(\\leq\\) on \\(P\\) that is reflexive and transitive. Two elements,\n\\(p\\) and \\(q\\), of \\(P\\) are called compatible if there\nexists \\(r\\in P\\) such that \\(r\\leq p\\) and \\(r\\leq q\\). An\nantichain of \\(P\\) is a subset of \\(P\\) whose elements are\npairwise-incompatible. A partial ordering \\(P\\) is called ccc\nif every antichain of \\(P\\) is countable. A non-empty subset \\(G\\) of\n\\(P\\) is called a filter if (i) every two elements of \\(G\\)\nare compatible, and (ii) if \\(p\\in G\\) and \\(p\\leq q\\), then also\n\\(q\\in G\\). Finally, a subset \\(D\\) of \\(P\\) is called dense\nif for every \\(p\\in P\\) there is \\(q\\in D\\) such that \\(q\\leq p\\).\n\nMA asserts the following:\n\n\nFor every ccc partial ordering \\(P\\) and every set \\(\\{ D_\\alpha\n:\\alpha <\\kappa \\}\\), where \\(\\kappa \\lt 2^{\\aleph_0}\\), of dense\nsubsets of \\(P\\), there exists a filter \\(G\\subseteq P\\) that is\ngeneric for the set, i.e., \\(G\\cap D_\\alpha \\ne\n{\\varnothing}\\), for all \\(\\alpha <\\kappa\\).\n\n\nSince MA follows easily from the CH, MA is only of interest if the CH\nfails. Martin and Solovay (1970) proved that MA plus the negation of\nthe CH is consistent with ZFC, using iterated forcing with the ccc\nproperty. At first sight, MA may not look like an axiom, namely an\nobvious, or at least reasonable, assertion about sets, but rather like\na technical statement about ccc partial orderings. It does look more\nnatural, however, when expressed in topological terms, for it is\nsimply a generalization of the well-known Baire Category Theorem,\nwhich asserts that in every compact Hausdorff topological space the\nintersection of countably-many dense open sets is non-empty. Indeed,\nMA is equivalent to:\n\n\nIn every compact Hausdorff ccc topological space, the intersection of\nless than \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\)-many dense open sets is non-empty.\n\n\nMA has many different equivalent formulations and has been used very\nsuccessfully to settle a large number of open problems in other areas\nof mathematics. For example, MA plus the negation of the CH implies\nSuslin\u2019s Hypothesis and that every \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^1_2\\) set\nof reals is Lebesgue measurable and has the Baire property. It also\nimplies that \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\) is a regular cardinal, but it does not\ndecide what cardinal it is. See Fremlin (1984) for many more\nconsequences of MA and other equivalent formulations. In spite of\nthis, the status of MA as an axiom of set theory is still unclear.\nPerhaps the most natural formulation of MA, from a foundational point\nof view, is in terms of generic absoluteness. Namely, MA is\nequivalent to the following:\n\n\nFor every ccc partial ordering \\(P\\), if an existential statement,\ncontaining subsets of some cardinal less than \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\) as\nparameters, holds in an (ideal) generic extension of \\(V\\) obtained by\nforcing with \\(P\\), then the statement is true, i.e., it holds in\n\\(V\\). In other words, if a set having a property that depends only on\nbounded subsets of \\( 2^{\\aleph_0}\\) exists in some (ideal) generic\nextension of \\(V\\) obtained by forcing with a ccc partial ordering,\nthen a set with that property already exists in \\(V\\).\n\n\nThe notion of ideal generic extension of \\(V\\) can be made precise in\nterms of so-called Boolean-valued models, which provide an alternative\nversion of forcing.\n\nMuch stronger forcing axioms than MA (for \\(\\omega_1\\)) were\nintroduced in the 1980s, such as J. Baumgartner\u2019s Proper\nForcing Axiom (PFA), and the stronger Martin\u2019s\nMaximum (MM) of Foreman, Magidor, and Shelah (1988). Both the PFA\nand MM are consistent relative to the existence of a supercompact\ncardinal. The PFA asserts the same as MA, but for partial orderings\nthat have a property weaker than the ccc, called properness,\nintroduced by Shelah. And MM asserts the same for the wider class of\npartial orderings that, when forcing with them, do not destroy\nstationary subsets of \\(\\omega_1\\).\n\nStrong forcing axioms, such as the PFA and MM imply that all\nprojective sets of reals are determined (PD), and have many other\nstrong consequences in infinite combinatorics. Notably, they imply\nthat the cardinality of the continuum is \\(\\aleph_2\\).\n\nA different forcing axiom is Woodin\u2019s Axiom \\((\\ast)\\), which\nresulted from his analysis of \\(\\mathbb{P}_{{\\rm max}}\\) forcing\nextensions over models of AD. Even though a stronger form of MM known\nas \\({\\rm MM}^{++}\\) and Axiom \\((\\ast)\\) have similar and very rich\nconsequences, both their motivation and their formulation are very\ndifferent, to the point that they were seen as competing axioms. Their\nconnection was far from being clear, until Asper\u00f3 and Schindler\n(2021) showed that, in the presence of large cardinals, Axiom\n\\((\\ast)\\) is equivalent to a bounded form of \\({\\rm MM}^{++}\\), and\ntherefore to a natural generic absoluteness principle.\n",
