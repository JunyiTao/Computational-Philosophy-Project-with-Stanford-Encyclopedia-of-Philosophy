Fans return to theaters to see films multiple times \nand buy DVDs so they can watch movies yet again. Although it is \nsomething of a received dogma in philosophy and psychology that \nsuspense requires uncertainty, many of the biggest box office \nsuccesses are action movies that fans claim to find suspenseful on \nrepeated viewings. The conflict between the theory of suspense and \nthe accounts of viewers generates a problem known as the paradox \nof suspense, which we can boil down to a simple question: If \nsuspense requires uncertainty, how can a viewer who knows the outcome\nstill feel suspense? \n\n\nThere is a related problem concerning \u201cmusical suspense\u201d: How can one\ncan feel suspense in response to sonic movements with which one is \nintimately acquainted? Unlike paradigmatic suspense, musical suspense\nis typically unaccompanied by fear. Accordingly, it is better \ndescribed as mere tension. Given the controversy over the nature of \nthe response to music, this entry will deal solely with the paradox of\nsuspense in regard to narrative artworks. \n\n\nI will consider four different solutions to the paradox of suspense: \n(1) the thought theory of entertained uncertainty, (2) the \ndesire-frustration theory of suspense, (3) the \nmoment-by-moment forgetting theory, and (4) the emotional \nmisidentification view. The thought theory of entertained \nuncertainty explains the paradox by denying that actual \nuncertainty is necessary for suspense; instead, all that is required \nis for viewers to engage the fiction as they normally \nwould\u2014entertaining thoughts of the story as if they were \nundecided. The desire-frustration theory holds that \nuncertainty, entertained or actual, is not necessary for suspense. To\ncreate suspense, one merely needs to frustrate a desire to affect the\noutcome of an imminent event. The moment-by-moment forgetting \nview is the position that while viewers are immersed in a fictional \nscenario, they effectively cannot remember the outcome. The \nemotional misidentification view holds that it is impossible \nfor viewers who know the outcome to feel suspense, and the best \nexplanation of the claims of audiences to the contrary is that \nviewers must be confusing their actual fear and anxiety with what \nthey take to be suspense. \n\n\nRather than provide an exhaustive survey of the literature on \nsuspense, in what follows I discuss representatives of the four types\nof solutions to the paradox. I begin with a description of the \nparadox of suspense and then explain which claims the various \nsolutions reject. \n", "toc": [{"#ParSus": "1. The Paradox of Suspense"}, {"#EntUnc": "2.

The Paradox of Suspense\n\n\nCognitive psychologists Ortony, Clore, and Collins put forth a useful\ntheory of suspense that we might call the standard account. They \nargue that suspense is composed of fear, hope, and the \u201ccognitive \nstate of uncertainty\u201d (131). They define fear as a feeling of \ndispleasure about the prospect of an undesirable event; and hope as a\nfeeling of pleasure about the prospect of a desirable event. On the \nstandard account, people feel suspense when they fear a bad outcome, \nhope for a good outcome, and are uncertain about which outcome will \ncome to pass. In real life, we might feel suspense when walking \nthrough an unfamiliar, reputedly dangerous neighborhood at night. We \nfear that we might be mugged, hope that we will be safe, and are \nuncertain which will occur. \n\n\nOrtony, Clore, and Collins argue that as \u201cprospect emotions,\u201d fear \nand hope depend on the desirability and likelihood of a prospective \noutcome\u2014the yet to be determined outcome of an event. For \nexample, fear is amplified as the degree of danger, the \nundesirability and/or likelihood of an outcome, increases. If I am \nfearful of being attacked, I am more fearful if the prospective \nattack is more undesirable: Given equal likelihood, I would be more \nfearful of being stabbed in the gut with a knife or a beaten about \nthe torso with a pillowcase full of oranges than merely punched \nrepeatedly. Similarly, the more likely I believe an undesirable \noutcome to be, the more fearful I may be of that outcome. The \nconverse is true concerning hope: The more desirable and likely an \noutcome seems the more hopeful we may feel. \n\n\nThe intensity of our feelings of suspense seems to rely on two \nfeatures of an event\u2019s outcome: (1) its uncertainty and (2) the \nsignificance of what is at stake. Although the standard view does not\nclaim a direct relationship between uncertainty, what is at stake, \nand suspense, it does suggest that the greatest suspense is felt in \ncases where the outcome is very uncertain and the stakes are very \nhigh. The standard view also tells us that you can have suspense with\nlow stakes if there is great uncertainty, or with low uncertainty if \nthere are high stakes. However, on the standard view, if there is no \nuncertainty, there can be no suspense. Similarly, if nothing is at \nstake, there can be no desirable or undesirable outcome, hence no \nfear or hope, and consequently no suspense. \n\n\nThe preceding analysis of suspense generates a \ntroublesome paradox. If uncertainty is required in order for one to \nfeel suspense, how is it that some narrative artworks can still \nseem suspenseful on repeated encounters? For example, if we have \nalready seen a movie, and we remember it well, then we are certain \nhow it will end. Although we may not feel suspense as intensely as we\ndid upon first viewing, it is undeniable that we can feel some \nsuspense upon repeated viewings. But if suspense requires \nuncertainty, it should be impossible to feel suspense during \nsubsequent viewings. This problem is known as the paradox of \nsuspense. It can be stated more formally as follows: \n\nSuspense requires uncertainty.\nKnowledge of a story\u2019s outcome precludes uncertainty.\nPeople feel suspense in response to some stories when they have knowledge of the outcome.\n\n\n\nAlthough none of these claims seems objectionable in isolation, \ntogether, they are inconsistent. The four solutions to the paradox \nthat I discuss in the next section each question one or another of \nthe claims that make up the paradox. The entertained uncertainty and \ndesire-frustration theories reject the first claim. The \nmoment-by-moment forgetting theory rejects the second premise. And \nthe emotional misidentification theory takes issue with the third. \n2. Entertained Uncertainty\n\n\nNo\u00ebl Carroll qualifies the first claim of the paradox; he argues\nthat suspense merely requires entertained uncertainty, not \nactual uncertainty (Carroll 2001). In \u201cThe Paradox of \nSuspense,\u201d Carroll offers a persuasive account of how we might \ndissolve this paradox. He argues that even if we know that a film \nwill end a certain way, we can still imagine while watching it, that \nit will not end that way. He argues that merely imagining that an \nevent\u2019s outcome is uncertain is enough to create suspense, thereby \nqualifying the first premise of the paradox\u2014only entertained \nuncertainty is necessary for suspense. \n\n\nNarrative, according to Carroll, is something akin to guided \nimagination, a process he describes as entertaining thoughts or \nholding propositions non-assertively (Carroll 1990). People can work \nthemselves into a variety of emotional states by merely imagining \nsituations that they know are untrue, such as being passed over for a\npromotion, cheated on by one\u2019s spouse, or having one\u2019s child \nkidnapped. The thought theory of emotional response is the \ntheory that fiction taps this power of the imagination for its energy\nto produce emotional reactions. This seems to solve the paradox of \nsuspense, since we can know that the hero will not die, but still \nfear the outcome simply by imagining that he might. On this view, \nsuspense does not require genuine uncertainty, only entertained \nuncertainty. Although we cannot be genuinely uncertain about the \noutcome of a familiar narrative, we can willfully entertain \nuncertainty. And we can entertain uncertainty on any number of \nencounters with the same story. \n\n\nAlthough Carroll\u2019s thought theory seems to explain how it is possible\nto feel suspense in response to a familiar narrative, it does not \ngive an explanation for the typical scenario of diminishing suspense.\nIf all it takes is entertained uncertainty (in addition to the \nunnamed other contributing factors), why do some fictions loose their\npower for many viewers? A perfectly willing viewer may eagerly sit \ndown to re-watch a suspenseful film without feeling nearly the same \namount of suspense as on the first viewing. This scenario\u2014that \nof diminishing returns (to the same narrative)\u2014is not merely \npossible, it is common. This shows that entertained uncertainty is \ninsufficient for recidivist suspense\u2014suspense felt \nin response to a familiar narrative. Perhaps the defender of the \nentertained uncertainty theory could reply by simply supplementing \nthe theory with an account of why it becomes more difficult or just \nless likely for audiences to entertain narrative outcomes as \nuncertain the more familiar they are with a story. \n\n\nRegardless, the theory faces bigger problems, one of which is that \nthere is reason to believe that entertained uncertainty is not \nnecessary for suspense. There are numerous cases where knowledge of \nthe outcome can make a narrative more, not less suspenseful. For \ninstance, the first time one watches Hitchcock\u2019s Psycho \n(1960), one may feel mild fear for Marion Crane as she chats with \nNorman Bates in the hotel office. Filled with stuffed, menacing \nbirds, the office creates an aura of danger, but viewers have no \nreason to suspect that in the next couple of minutes Norman will bury\na carving knife in Marion\u2019s chest as she showers. However, on a \nsecond viewing, one feels a great deal more suspense during the \noffice scene. Norman\u2019s disturbance seems obvious on repeated \nviewings. How could Marion fail to see it? One wants to scream \u201cGet \nout of there!\u201d The reason why the office scene in Psycho is \nmore suspenseful on subsequent viewings cannot be that audiences are \nentertaining the idea that the outcome is as uncertain as it was on \ntheir first viewing, since the first viewing is not as suspenseful as\nthe second. \n\n\nThis objection rests on the claim that normal people do indeed feel \nsuspense on the second viewing of Psycho, but one might simply\ndeny this claim. Perhaps audiences merely feel tension or \nanticipation, but not suspense. As we shall see, this is precisely \nwhat defenders of the emotional misidentification view say in \nresponse to all reports of recidivist suspense. If the defender of the \nentertained uncertainty view were to make a similar response to cases\nlike that of Psycho\u2014cases where one seemingly feels more\nsuspense when the outcome is certain\u2014she risks undermining the \nsupport for her central claim that recidivist suspense is common. \nThe defender of entertained uncertainty would owe us a clear \nexplanation for why we should trust the phenomenology in some cases \nand not in others. \n\n\nHowever, if we trust the phenomenology, if we trust audience members\u2019\naccounts of what they feel when they watch Psycho, then we \nhave additional reason to reject the claim of the paradox\u2014the \nclaim that suspense requires uncertainty. But we lack an explanation \nfor how this is possible. The next theory that we will consider \nattempts to provide an answer. \n3. The Desire-Frustration Theory of Suspense\n\n\nAaron Smuts defends the desire-frustration theory of suspense, which \nholds that the frustration of a desire to affect the outcome of an \nimmanent event is both necessary and sufficient to create suspense. \nWhereas Carroll revises the first claim, Smuts simply denies that \nuncertainty is necessary for suspense (Smuts 2008). Smuts appeals to \nexamples such as Psycho\u2014which are more suspenseful on \nrepeated to encounters\u2014and historical re-enactments such as \nTouching the Void (2004)\u2014where the audience knows the \noutcome before the first viewing\u2014to support the claim that \nuncertainty is unnecessary for suspense. \n\n\nSmuts argues that in all suspenseful narratives and in all \nsuspenseful situations in real life we find factors that partially \nfrustrate one\u2019s ability to satisfy a desire, factors that suspend \none\u2019s efficacy. He argues that even when the stakes are high, if one \nis actively working towards the realization of a desired outcome, \nthere can be no suspense. Smuts\u2019 explanation of why fictions are \nextremely effective at creating suspense and how suspense in response\nto fictions is possible when we know the outcome is this: In contrast\nwith our engagement with real situations, where we can actively work \ntowards the satisfaction of a desire, in engaging with fictions we \nare completely powerless. \n\n\nSmuts notes that our inability to affect fictions is something we are\noften aware of, and something the masters of suspense frequently make\nprominent. For instance, one of the most suspenseful episodes in \nHitchcock\u2019s Rear Window (1954) is that in which Lisa (Grace \nKelly) is looking for evidence of murder in the apartment across the \nway. Through binoculars, Jeff (James Stewart) sees Thorwald enter his\napartment as Lisa is hunting around in the bedroom. Jeff\u2019s position \nmirrors that of the audience: We are unable to warn Lisa of the \ndanger, utterly incapable of using our knowledge to affect the \noutcome. Similarly, Smuts and Frome argue that the most suspenseful \nvideogames are those where the player is temporarily taken out of \ncontrol, having to wait to see how a jump turns out or whether his or\nher character will be discovered by sniffing guard dogs. Smuts\u2019 \nexplanation is that the partial frustration of our ability to satisfy\nour desires is necessary to the creation of suspense. \n\n\nThere are at least two important questions unanswered by the \ndesire-frustration theory. First, why do suspenseful events need to \nbe imminent? This element of the theory is under-developed, raising \ndoubts about its claims to sufficiency. The defender of the \ndesire-frustration theory might be able to reply that this is merely \na function of the way we desire\u2014near events provoke much \nstronger responses than those that are distant. But, as it stands, \nthe account is incomplete. \n\n\nSecond, one can feel suspense in response to situations where one \nmight not readily consent to having a desire. If so, the frustration \nof a desire would not be necessary for suspense. For instance, in \nMichael Clayton (2008) the two thugs hired to kill the \nprotagonist try to install a tracking device in his car radio. Before\nthey can finish, Michael starts walking back to his car. The scene is\nincredibly suspenseful, but what desire is frustrated? I cannot \nrecall desiring to warn Michael. Is it the desire to see the thugs \nget away unnoticed? That would be odd. It is not clear why audiences \nwould desire to see the installation complete, since our sympathies \ncertainly lie with Michael and not his pursuers. But neither does it \nseem that we want to do something to stop the installation of the \ntracking device. \n\nAn additional worry that has been raised for the desire frustration\ntheory is that the desire to change a fictional world is a desire that\nnecessarily can\u2019t be satisfied. As such it is a deviant desire that\nmay be seen as implausibly weird (Uidhir 2011a, 2011b). On the other\nhand, such desires may be thought of as \u201cwishes\u201d. For\ninstance, if I regret some past action, it is plausible to say that I\nwish I could change the past. It is a common sort of desire, even\nthough it can\u2019t be satisfied.\n4. Moment By Moment Forgetting\n\n\nRichard Gerrig argues for what we can call the moment-by-moment \nforgetting theory. Unlike the previous two explanations, Gerrig \nthinks that suspense requires uncertainty. His solution to the \nparadox is to deny the second premise\u2014that knowing the outcome \nof a narrative precludes uncertainty. Despite appearances, Gerrig \nclaims that one can both know how a story turns out and be uncertain \nabout the result while the story unfolds. \n\n\nBy appealing to some putative features of our cognitive architecture, \nGerrig claims that people are unable to effectively make use of their\nknowledge of the outcome of a story in such a way that would preclude\nsuspense. Gerrig offers an evolutionary psychological explanation of \nhow this could be possible. He argues that evolution has not equipped\nhumans with the ability to look up known outcomes to repeated events.\nSince there are no exactly repeated events in nature, there was \nsimply no selective pressure to develop such an ability. As such, \nrepeaters can feel suspense, because while they are caught in the \ngrips of a story they are unaware of the outcome. In this way, Gerrig\nargues, fictional scenarios can be effectively uncertain for viewers \neven if they know the outcome. \n\n\nThis may seem plausible in relation to cases in which suspenseful \nsituations occur rapidly, but take a movie such as Speed (Jan \nde Bont, 1994) where a series of dangerous situations put the \ncharacters in jeopardy, and each situation unfolds over the course of\nseveral minutes. It\u2019s hard to imagine that recall could take \nso long. The ability to make decisions rapidly in stressful \nsituations, such as how to escape a coming attacker or how to avoid \nbeing hit by a car, involves knowing how pursuers and drivers behave \nby recalling similar scenarios. This mechanism seems close to what is\ninvolved into forecasting the outcome of a fictional event. If we can\nforecast, then surely we can remember in the span of several minutes \nwhether or not our forecast is correct based on our knowledge of the \nstory. Given the prevalence of similar cognitive capacities and the \ngradual unfolding of suspense scenarios, Gerrig\u2019s portrait of the \nlazy mind of repeaters is prima facie unconvincing. \n\n\nA related problem with Gerrig\u2019s account is that if viewers really do \nsuffer from such mental handicaps as a matter of our evolutionary \nmakeup, then he lacks an explanation of why suspense diminishes for \nmany viewers. It would be strange to say that some of us have evolved\na special cognitive ability to recall the outcomes of identically \nrepeating events when there are no evolutionary pressures for such a \ntrait. What seems to be the problem is that Gerrig has miscast the \nkind of skill that is involved. As stated previously, our ability to \nforecast the outcomes of familiar types of events can plausibly \naccount for our ability to remember the outcomes of familiar \nfictional scenarios. \n\n\nA further problem with Gerrig\u2019s theory is that it cannot account for \na common phenomenon of repeated viewing, namely that with knowledge \nof the outcome of a story we are able to notice things that we might \notherwise find unexceptional. Take Hitchcock\u2019s Shadow of a \nDoubt (1943) as an example. Early in the film, aspects of Uncle \nCharlie\u2019s behavior that might otherwise go unnoticed seem like \nobvious evidence of his murderous past on repeated viewings. This \ncommon experience requires the same kind of recall abilities that \nGerrig thinks are necessarily retarded. If there were, as Gerrig \nsuggests, \u201ca systematic failure of memory processes to produce \nrelevant knowledge as the narrative unfolds\u201d then our ability when \ninformed by knowledge of the narrative outcome to notice new clues \nupon a reviewing is utterly mysterious (Gerrig 1997, 172). Since the \nmoment-by-moment forgetting theory implies that one cannot both feel \nsuspense on a reviewing of Shadow of a Doubt and notice new \nclues during the same scenes, it appears to conflict with the \nevidence. \n5. Emotional Misidentification\n\n\nRobert Yanal offers a resolution to the paradox by denying the third \npremise, that repeaters feel genuine suspense on repeated encounters \nwith familiar narratives. Yanal\u2019s emotional misidentification view \nholds that there are no true repeaters, only misidenitifiers. He \nargues that since suspense requires uncertainty, the best account for\nthe any claim that the same movie was just as suspenseful on the 4th,\n5th, or 6th viewing is that the recidivist is confused, mislabeling \nhis emotional response. The recidivist is not feeling suspense, \nonly anticipation. Uncertainty is necessary for suspense, but not for\nmere anticipation. \n\n\nHowever, feeling suspense upon repeated viewings after a great span \nof time is an altogether different phenomenon. We often forget how a \nstory unfolds and are genuinely uncertain about what happens. So, in \na sense, the fiction is new for forgetters. On Yanal\u2019s account, one \ncan be a confused recidivist, a forgetter, or a virgin viewer; but, \none cannot be a true repeater. True repeaters are not possible, since\nthey lack the cognitive uncertainty necessary for suspense. \n\n\nYanal\u2019s solution rests on the distinction between anticipation and \nsuspense. But lacking a clear phenomenal distinction between the kind\nof anticipation that viewers putatively confuse with suspense and \ngenuine suspense, we have cause to be suspicious. Since this kind of \nanticipation and suspense appear to feel the same, the principal \ndifference, on Yanal\u2019s account, must be that the reaction cannot be \nsuspense proper without the cognitive state of uncertainty. If so, \nYanal has simply defined the problem under the rug. Why, we must ask,\ndo viewers feel \u201canticipation\u201d in response to narrative situations \nwhere they know the characters will survive unharmed? \n\n\nWithout much exposition, Yanal seizes upon the notion that suspense \nrequires uncertainty. From there he constructs an a priori \nargument to the effect that it is impossible that suspense occur when\nthe outcomes are known. On this definition alone, he concludes that \neither repeaters have forgotten the outcome, and they are not true \nrepeaters, or they have misidentified the emotion they are \nexperiencing. \n\n\nOn the same line of reasoning, audience members must be \nmisidentifying a range of emotional responses, including fear. The \ngeneration of suspense in repeaters is no less mysterious than the \ngeneration of fear. We feel fear in response to familiar fictional \nevents that we know will turn out well. But how could this be \npossible? How can we fear an event that we know will result in a \ndesired outcome? The same question arises concerning both \nfirst-person fear (fear for one\u2019s self) and fear for others. \n\n\nYanal argues that \u201cexperiencing fear is neither itself suspenseful \nnor is it contingent upon ignorance. (I may know with certainty that \nmy friend will be executed tomorrow, and yet feel fear for him, \nanxiety over his welfare, etc)\u201d (Yanal 1999, 139). Without any hope \nthat your friend will be executed, you would most likely feel dread, \nnot fear. But this is beside the point, since the situation with most\nfictions is that you feel fear where you know with certainty, say if \nyou have seen the movie before, that nothing bad will happen to the \nhero. Again, consider Speed: If you have seen the film or know\nthe genre conventions, then you know that nothing bad will happen to \nthe main characters, though it is possible to feel fear upon repeated\nviewings. At least, it appears to be possible if we have any faith at\nall in the phenomenological reports of audiences. \n\n\nIf the relevant form of fear is best described as a prospect emotion,\nthen the cognitive state of uncertainty would plausibly be necessary \nfor fear. Are we to conclude that audience members must be confusing \nwhat they take to be fear with some other emotion? If so, what could \nit possibly be? Although we may not be infallible introspectors, we \ncannot help but assume that people can reliably identify when they \nfeel fear. An a priori assumption that fear requires \nuncertainty is not sufficient to warrant the attribution of pervasive\nemotional misidentification. The same goes for suspense. \n\n\nOne reason why it may sound more plausible to hypothesize radically \nfallible introspective abilities regarding suspense but not fear, is \nthat suspense seems to be a composite emotional state, lacking the \ncorresponding kind of clear specifications. Rather than a pure \nemotional kind, suspense is better described as an emotional amalgam,\ncomprised of fear and hope, where uncertainty, if it is required, is \nimplied in the components: As such, suspense is a best thought of as \na composite emotion. \n6. Suspense and Surprise\n\n\nSome explanation is in order for why Yanal and others think it \nunquestionable that uncertainty is required for suspense. Often \nsuspenseful fictions include many surprises, and one can feel \nsuspense if they think a surprise is up ahead. Picking up on this, \nmany discussions of suspense, such as Kendall Walton\u2019s, lump together\ntheir treatments of suspense and surprise (Walton, 1990: 259\u2013271). \nThe tendency to think of suspense as intimately related to surprise, \nfor which uncertainty appears to be required, may be one reason why \nmany people think suspense requires the same. But this assumption is \nmistaken in two ways. \n\n\nFirst, surprise does not require uncertainty, although it might first\nappear otherwise. If I think that something will happen and it does, \nthen I will not feel surprise. For example, if I think that my \nfriends have gathered at my apartment for my birthday, I will not \nfeel surprise when I come home and find them in my living room. Based\non failed surprise parties, one may conclude that surprise requires \nuncertainty. But this is too hasty. Surprise does not require that we\nbe in a cognitive state of uncertainty. And it is fairly easy to see \nwhy. I may be certain that my beer sits on the table in front of me, \nbut if it disappears when I reach for it, I will be surprised. Hence,\nI can feel surprise without uncertainty. To be mistaken is not the \nsame as to be uncertain. Surprise results from the sudden subversion \nof an expectation, not the resolution of cognitive uncertainty. \n\n\nSecond, although suspense and surprise are often found in the same \nfictions, and the prospect of a surprise can be the source of some \nsuspense, the connection stops there: Surprise is not involved in all\nor even most cases of suspense. Hence, whether suspense requires \nuncertainty is a matter independent of that concerning the conditions\nnecessary for surprise. \n7. Summary\n\n\nFour solutions to the paradox of suspense have been surveyed above:\nthe thought theory of entertained uncertainty, the desire-frustration\ntheory, the moment-by-moment forgetting view, and the emotional\nmisidentification view. The first two theories attempt to solve the\nparadox by explaining how it is that we feel suspense under conditions\nof certainty. The moment-by-moment forgetting theory effectively\ndenies that we do have knowledge of the outcome of a story, even if we\nhave read it before. And the emotional misidentification view denies\nthat we do feel suspense on repeated encounters with a narrative,\ndespite appearances. \n\n\nThe problems with the four theories are various, but it pays to note \nthat a theory of suspense should be able to do more than simply \nprovide a solution to the paradox of suspense; it should also be able\nto explain two additional facts. First, as noted above, suspense \noften diminishes after we have watched a movie, and continues to \ndiminish on subsequent viewings.
