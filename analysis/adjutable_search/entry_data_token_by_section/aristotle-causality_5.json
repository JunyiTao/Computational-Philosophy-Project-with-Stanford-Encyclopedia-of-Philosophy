    "main_text": "The Explanation of a Lunar Eclipse\n6. The Explanation of a Lunar Eclipse\n\nWe have already seen that Aristotle is not committed to the view that\neverything has all four kinds of causes, Rather, his view is that a\nscientific explanation requires up to four kinds of causes. We may\nillustrate this point with the help of an example. Consider, in\nparticular, the case of a lunar eclipse. In the Metaphysics,\nAristotle says that an eclipse of the moon does not have a final cause\n(Metaph. VIII 4, 1044 b 12). He also says that, strictly\nspeaking, a lunar eclipse does not have matter. Rather, it has a cause\nthat plays a role analogous to matter. This second claim can\nbe inferred from what Aristotle says about the things that exist by\nnature but are not substances. With respect to these things, Aristotle\nsays that they do not have matter but rather something that underlies\n(Metaph. VIII 4, 1044 b 8\u20139). In the case of a lunar\neclipse, that which underlies is the subject affected by the eclipse,\nthat is, the moon. The moon is not strictly speaking the matter of the\neclipse but rather the subject that undergoes an eclipse when the\nearth comes in the middle between the moon and the sun. Should we give\nthe earth as the efficient cause of a lunar eclipse? We have to be\ncareful here. By saying that the moon is a deprivation of light caused\nby the earth, we distinguish this particular deprivation of light from\nother kinds of deprivation of light. Still, by citing the earth as the\nefficient cause of a lunar eclipse, we are not yet giving the most\nprecise description of the efficient cause. More directly, we are not\nyet saying what the earth is doing to cause a lunar eclipse. A lunar\neclipse is a deprivation of light caused by the interposition of the\nearth between the sun and the moon. By coming in the middle of the\nmoon and the sun the earth blocks the light and causes the moon to\nsuffer an eclipse. Hence, it is the interposition of the earth between\nthe sun and the moon is the proximate efficient cause of a\nlunar eclipse. Citing the proximate efficient cause is also giving the\nmost accurate description, and indeed the full explanation, of a lunar\neclipse. (An insightful discussion of how Aristotle explains natural\nphenomena such as a lunar eclipse and sleep can be found in Code 2015:\n11\u201345).\n\nThis brief discussion of the explanation of an eclipse of the moon\nbrings us back to a point that was already made in connection with\nAristotle\u2019s explanation of the production of an artifact such as\na bronze statue. There too we are required to look for the most\naccurate description of the efficient cause, which is to be identified\nwith the art of bronze-casting a statue rather than the artisan. It is\npossible to build on both examples to conclude that Aristotle is\nconcerned not only with finding the relevant kinds of causes but also\nwith giving the most accurate description of those causes. By his\nlights, it is only the most accurate description of all the relevant\ncauses that gives us the full explanation, and thereby scientific\nknowledge, of something.\n",
