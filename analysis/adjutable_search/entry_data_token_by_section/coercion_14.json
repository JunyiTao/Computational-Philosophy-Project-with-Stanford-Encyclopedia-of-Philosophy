    "main_text": "Uses for thought about coercion || Coercion, freedom, and voluntariness\n3.4 Political/legal theory and coercion\n\nAs the historical section of this entry suggests, the relationship\nbetween states, law, and coercion has been a subject of vast\ndiscussion throughout Western philosophical history. Many of the most\npressing issues belong to a discussion of states and law rather than\nto a discussion of\n coercion.[26]\n However, some theorists have attempted to draw some fairly\nrevisionist lessons about politics and law from their theoretical\ndiscussions of coercion. This work is worth consideration here, since\ntheir conclusions may impact how we understand the nature of coercion,\nand its place in law and politics.\n3.4.1 The coerciveness of law\n\nAs noted above, there are a number of accounts of coercion that insist\nthat coercion is a violation of right, or otherwise normatively\ndefective, of which Alan Wertheimer\u2019s Coercion is the\nmost prominent. But if coercion is necessarily immoral action, then it\nis hard to explain how an act of coercion could count as\n justified.[27]\n Among other implications, this view is in apparent contradiction with\nthe traditional approach to coercion which treats states as\nparadigmatically, even necessarily users of coercion. As William\nEdmundson has pointed out (and as Nozick 1969, had noticed), if the\nstate is justified in punishing wrongdoers, then when it threatens to\ndo so, it does not threaten to make them worse off than they ought to\nbe (Edmundson 1995 and 1998, chs. 4\u20136). Hence on an approach to\ncoercion that insists it is immoral activity, the state\u2019s use of\npolice powers to enforce the law is not coercive.\n\nCould this be right? It hinges, first, on whether one accepts a\nmoralized analysis of coercion; if one can give a non-moralized\naccount of coercion, then the grounds for the claim are much more\ntenuous. It would also seem to depend on whether the moral evaluation\nof the coercer\u2019s action is an \u201call things\nconsidered\u201d judgment, or merely a pro tanto one. While\nthe government\u2019s use of coercion may be all-things-considered\nmorally benign, the threat of jailing someone may count as pro\ntanto wrong in a way that, say, paying a reward is not. If so,\nthen even on a moralized account we may suppose that government\ncoercion requires special justification before it can be accepted.\nWertheimer, Haksar, Lamond, and Oberdiek, for instance, seem to find\nno problem accepting that there is \u201cjustified coercion\u201d\n\u2014 that is, acts which are coercive on a moralized theory of\ncoercion (baseline or otherwise), yet which are ultimately justified\nby other considerations (Oberdiek 1976; Haksar 1976; Wertheimer 1987;\nand Lamond 2000 and 2001). Edmundson, however, argues that such a view\nis unmotivated and not required by a moralized theory, properly\nunderstood. If he is right, then the uses of what are normally thought\nof as coercive techniques do not call for special scrutiny if they are\nconstrained to the support of just, procedurally sound law.\n\nEdmundson\u2019s criticism of the canonical view of the state as\ncoercive reveals a deeper root to some disagreements over coercion. In\neffect, Edmundson provides a reason to question how special or\nimportant coercion really is. Coercion may make some actions\nnecessary, but human beings in any natural world will be constrained\nby necessities of many sorts: the physical limits of our bodies in our\nenvironments, and our needs for things such as nourishment, shelter,\nprotection, and even perhaps community, recognition, and love. To be\ncoerced adds to or alters in some ways what it is necessary for one to\ndo. But being subject to a coercive set of laws might also provide one\ngreater opportunities or freedom from necessity, as arguably the\ncriminal law does, at least if well-drafted and\n enforced.[28]\n If just laws provide us protection from wrong-doers while leaving us\nat liberty to take any morally justifiable act (assuming here that the\ncriminal law prohibits only unjust acts), then the law\u2019s\nthreatened use of force against lawbreakers may not merit any special\nscrutiny. We might instead regard it as a shifting, regularization,\nand rationalization of the necessities to which human beings are\nanyways subject. Edmundson and those he disputes with can all agree\nthat coercion used for illicit ends is a matter of moral significance\nand a cause for special scrutiny and opposition. What Edmundson shows\nis that moralized approaches to coercion make it hard to see why the\ntechnique itself and the agents who can use it are especially worthy\nof our attention.\n\nOne might thus object to moralized accounts on the grounds that we\nhave reason to track and scrutinize uses of this technique whether\nperformed well or badly, justly or unjustly. This is because when an\nagent has the power to coerce willy nilly, as the state does, it is up\nto such an agent to decide what purposes it will use its powers for.\nNatural necessities are typically predictable, stable requirements on\nour actions, persisting without regard to us as individuals. By\ncontrast, powerful agents are not necessarily predictable, stable, or\nindifferent to us as individuals. Rather, they can target and direct\ntheir powers to suit their purposes. Of course we hope that they are\nconstrained by justice, but even mostly just governments are likely to\nenact bad laws or have rogue elements within them. Hence there is\nvalue in having a concept to pick out the sort of technique used in\nlaw enforcement, forced migrations, mafia protection rackets,\nback-alley robbery, and the training of some recalcitrant children,\nsince one and the same state might use the same tools and techniques\nto engage any or all of these sorts of activities, with only the whim\nof the leader or parliament to decide which it shall be.\n\nA slightly less radical, though still revisionist claim about the\ncoerciveness of law, holds that the coerciveness of law resides in its\nclaim to a right to use (or authorize the use of) enforcement power.\nDrawing a distinction between the state and its apparatuses on the one\nhand, and the law on the other, Grant Lamond argues that the\ncoerciveness of law should not be thought to depend on the fact that\nthe state has such things as police departments and prisons as its\nenforcement mechanisms. Rather, he argues that the coerciveness of law\nresides in its claim to a \u201cright to authorize the\nenforcement of [its subjects duties, responsibilities,\netc.]\u2026 It is not that legal duties are sanction-based, nor that\nevery law must ultimately be linked to coercive measures, but that law\nclaims the right to back up its directives with force\u201d\n(Lamond 2001, 55). He later clarifies this view to point out that the\nlaw claims indeterminate authority to enforce its\ndictates.\n\nLamond\u2019s aim in making this distinction is to clarify what he\nsees to be several possible confusions. First, he argues that the\nlaw\u2019s coerciveness need not depend directly on the state\u2019s\nown enforcement apparatus; the state might use vigilantes, private\ncontractors, or other private means for this\n function.[29]\n Moreover, he aims to limit law\u2019s responsibility for coercive\nacts to just those that it in fact authorizes: extra-legal uses of\ncoercion by the state should not be chalked up to law\u2019s\ncoerciveness. He also argues that some of the coercive enforcements\nthat law uses are not themselves uses of force; instead, one might\nconfiscate bank accounts or take away rights in non-tangible property\n(such as intellectual property protections) as means to pressure\nsubjects to comply with the law. Lamond holds that if such\ninterventions exert sufficient pressure on the will of those\nconsidering a particular option, such that they change course, then\nthey may be counted as coercive, even if they do not involve the\nthreat or imposition of sanctions conditioned on the activities of the\npeople governed (Lamond 2000, 56\u201357). Lastly, like Edmundson, he\naims to downplay the supposed role that coercion plays in our\nappreciation of the law, holding that many of law\u2019s functions do\nnot depend specifically on its function of authorizing (or not\nauthorizing) enforcements on the subjects. \u201cIt is easy to\nexaggerate the role of coercion in maintaining the efficacy of the\nlegal system, and to overestimate its capacity to sustain\nefficacy\u201d (Lamond 2001, 57).\n\nLamond\u2019s claim about law\u2019s coerciveness stems from a\nnumber of considerations, but undoubtedly one is his understanding of\nthe nature of coercion itself, which was discussed in Section 2.5\nabove. Whether or not his account of coercion is tenable, what Lamond\nsays about why law is coercive generates independent difficulties.\nEven if the law claims to authorize the enforcement of its\nsubjects\u2019 duties, it is not clear why the mere claiming\nof such authorization would suffice to make the claiming coercive. The\nlaws of a state may well provide for and instruct agencies or\nmechanisms to serve as its enforcers (e.g., police, vigilantes, or\nrobots); but if these enforcers quit, or are bought/killed/shut off,\nthe coerciveness of the law will quickly evaporate. If, for instance,\nthe army decides to side with the protestors rather than the\ngovernment, the law loses its force in a hurry, no matter how\nlegitimate. Moreover, were a private association or other institution\nto \u201clay claim\u201d to use such indeterminately bounded\nenforcement powers, what would determine whether in fact they ended up\nbeing coercive is whether in fact they managed to engage in\nenforcement activities through agencies or mechanisms similar to those\nthat states regularly use, or so Lucas points out. (Lucas 1966,\n61\u20132) A church, for instance, might even leverage its threats\nwith claims about the final disposition of one\u2019s mortal soul.\nBut this sort of claim to reward and punish does not give the church\nthe ability to coerce, at least as this concept is usually understood\nin political contexts.\n\nSome have argued directly that law does not require coercive backing\nin order to count as law (e.g., Raz 1975), holding that what is\ninstead important is that law is made by the appropriate authority\n(see also Oberdiek 1976). Going further than this, Robert Hughes\nargues that there can be laws a state is entitled to make but not\nentitled to enforce. \u201cWhether a government is entitled to\nenforce any given legal restriction coercively depends on concrete\nempirical facts, not only on abstract truisms about human nature, and\non moral features of the restriction in question\u201d (Hughes 2013,\n184). Such empirical factors on Hughes\u2019 account include whether\ncompliance can be obtained through non-coercive means, and what the\ncosts of using coercion to secure compliance would be. Responding to\nJoseph Raz, Edmundson, and Lamonde, inter alia, Ekow Yankah\ndefends the traditional view connecting law and coercion, contending\nthat \u201cLegal norms must be ultimately enforceable by coercion to\nbe included in the core concept of the law\u201d (Yankah 2008, 1198).\nAfter developing his own non-moralized conception of coercion, Yankah\nargues that law requires not only authority but the ability to compel\nobedience. There are, after all, many different possible normative\nsystems, for example religious ones, that claim to have moral\nauthority to command obedience, but law is distinctive among them\nbecause it has the possibility to compel compliance with the edicts of\njustified authorities. Countering Raz\u2019s view that coercion might\nbe merely instrumentally needed, Yankah asserts, \u201cthe inability\nof any structure to even theoretically compel [a lawbreaker] to obey\nwould cast serious doubt on the system\u2019s claim to be the\nlaw\u201d (Yankah, 2008, 1236; for others on this side of the dispute\nsee Himma 2016 and Woodbury-Smith 2020).\n3.4.2 The coerciveness of states\n\nMoving from the question of how law relates to coercion to the broader\nquestion of how states and politics more generally relate to coercion,\nthere are a number of ways that political theory addresses the role of\ncoercion as a tool of statecraft, and offers arguments about how\ncoercion conditions the scope and legitimacy of political action. Max\nWeber famously defined the state in terms of its legitimate\nmonopolization of physical coercive force within a territory:\n\n\nA political organisation will be called a \u201cruling\norganisation\u201d to the extent that its existence and the validity\nof its orders can be continually guaranteed within a given\ngeographical area by the application and threat of physical coercion\nby an administrative staff. An institutionally organised political\nenterprise (Anstaltsbetrieb) will be called a state if, and\nto the extent that, its administrative staff can lay claim to a\nmonopoly of legitimate physical force in the execution of its orders\n(Weber 2019 [1921], \u00a717, 135\u2013136; See also Weber 1946\n[1921]).\n\n\nLiberals, broadly construed, have been impressed with the power of the\nstate and its potential both for misuse as well as partisan domination\nover and sectarian interference with dissenters, and thus have\nidentified its employment of coercion as generating a distinctive set\nof political concerns. For instance, G. E. M. Anscombe argues that if\nstates are to be distinguished from mafias, it is only because they\nmay, if well ordered, earn authority over their subjects, which she\nunderstands as \u201ca right to be obeyed\u201d (Anscombe 1981,\n132). Judith Shklar, in her \u201cLiberalism of Fear,\u201d draws\nattention to the distinctiveness and historical rarity of the modern\nliberal state as one in which the power of the government is\nconstrained by foreswearing the use of cruelty and fear as tools of\nstatecraft (Shklar 1989). Others, such as Charles Larmore and Gerald\nGaus, take coercion to be a distinctively problematic interpersonal\nimposition. Hence, because states are understood to be the\npreeminently coercive agents, the justification of the state depends\nin significant part on whether there is sufficient justification for\nits use of coercion to secure compliance with its decisions (see\nLarmore 1996, ch. 6; Gaus 2003).\n\nEchoing Weber, in A Theory of Justice, Rawls distinguishes\nthe \u201clegal system\u201d of a state by \u201cits comprehensive\nscope and its regulative powers with respect to other associations.\nThe constitutional agencies that it defines generally have the\nexclusive legal right to at least the more extreme forms of coercion.\nThe kinds of duress that private associations can employ are strictly\nlimited\u201d (Rawls 1999 [1971], 207), and \u201cBy enforcing a\npublic system of penalties government removes the grounds for thinking\nthat others are not complying with the rules. For this reason alone, a\ncoercive sovereign is presumably always necessary, even though in a\nwell-ordered society sanctions are not severe and may never need to be\nimposed\u201d (Rawls 1999 [1971], 211). In his later Justice as\nFairness: A Restatement, he regards coercion as an intrinsic\nfeature of state political activity: \u201cPolitical power is always\ncoercive power applied by the state and its apparatus of\nenforcement\u201d (Rawls 2001, 40). He goes so far as to suggest that\nif people in a society could attain their goods harmoniously, without\nresorting to private coercion or relying on public coercion to resolve\nconflicts, it would be \u201ca society in a certain sense beyond\njustice. It has eliminated the occasions when the appeal to the\nprinciples of right and justice is necessary\u201d (Rawls 1999\n[1971], 249). Rawls goes on to argue for the importance of justice as\nthe primary regulative virtue of the basic structure and institutions\nthat determine the distribution of benefits and burdens to members of\nsociety (Rawls 1999 [1971], 4).\n\nAlthough Rawls does not offer a detailed explication or defense of his\nunderstanding of coercion, due to the outsized influence of his\npolitical theory, his thinking about the place of coercion in politics\nhas set the terms for several debates in this area. One issue that\nbears the distinctive mark of his thinking is whether and why the\nprincipal object of justice is the basic structure of a society, and\nhow that structure should be delimited. Expressed in terms somewhat\nless specific to Rawls, we may query whether the state is distinctly a\nuser of coercion, and what difference this might make to the question\nof its activities should be regulated. Another area for inquiry\nconsiders whether there are special limits to a state\u2019s use of\ncoercion, and/or whether it needs to meet some special condition for\nits justification (for this way of structuring the concerns here, see\nKolodny 2017 and 2018). Some, following Rawls, argue that some form of\npublic justification that speaks to all reasonable members of society\nis required to justify the state\u2019s use of coercion; others\nreject this requirement, while supporting other grounds of\njustification instead. And still others hold that the state\u2019s\nuse of coercion does not require distinctive justification or need to\nbe limited to only a specific range of purposes. A third line of\ninquiry asks whether there are implications from the state\u2019s use\nof coercive power for determining the scope of the obligations of\njustice. Some, again following Rawls, hold that because members of a\nsingle polity are mutually subject to the power of coercion that they\nmaterially facilitate, they have distinctive obligations of\ndistributive justice to one another that do not apply to those not\nsimilarly part of the same polity. Others object to this argument on a\nnumber of grounds.\n3.4.3 Are states distinctively coercive?\n\nThe first set of inquiries here concerns whether the state\u2019s\ncoercive activities are distinctively coercive, compared to other\nsocial institutions and practices. One reason Rawls offers for\napplying his principles of justice to the \u201cbasic\nstructure\u201d of society (which includes such things as the\npolitical constitution, the major social institutions and practices\nthat structure human relationships, such as the family) is\n\u201cbecause its effects are so profound and present from the\nstart\u201d (Rawls 1999 [1971], 7). While it appears clear that the\nstate, via its coercive determination of law and institutions like the\neconomic system, constitutes much of the \u201cbasic\nstructure,\u201d it is hardly the only source of profound\nconstraining effects on the lives of its subjects. This point is\npressed by G. A. Cohen, who argues regarding Rawls\u2019s principles\nof justice that their application should not be limited to just those\nparts of the \u201cbasic structure\u201d of society that are the\noutgrowth of the state\u2019s coercive institutions. Cohen then\nargues that a social institution such as the structure of the family\nis something that is largely determined by conventional social\npractices rather than by the coercively-backed laws of the state. Yet\nfew aspects of a society\u2019s structure will have more profound\neffects on the life prospects and possibilities for action than the\nway family structures are organized. Since these are not defined by\nthe state\u2019s coercive apparatus (or so Cohen suggests),\nthere\u2019s no reason why the principles of justice should be\nlimited to regulating just the parts of the social structure that owes\nits existence to the state\u2019s coercive impetus (Cohen 1997).\nWhether or not one holds that the social structures one is born into,\nsuch as a particular set of family arrangements, count as coercive,\ntheir structure is largely outside the bounds of the state coercive\nenforcement, even though they constrain choice and possibility in a\nway little different from state coercive decisions.\n\nWhile accepting that the family, in some of its aspects, should be\ncounted within the \u201cbasic structure\u201d and thus is\naccountable to principles of justice, Blain Neufeld argues that there\nis good reason to restrict concern with social justice to just those\nsocial institutions that are \u201corganized and maintained through\nthe collective exercise of coercive power\u201d (Neufeld 2009, p.\n37). The state\u2019s use of power is distinctive in two ways: it is\nan activity of the whole collective body, so requires justification to\nall of those who are part of that body. And the whole of that society\nis subject to it; it is normally very difficult or impossible for\nindividuals to exempt themselves from a state\u2019s coercive\njurisdiction. The use of coercion here is not arbitrary, since the\nfunctioning of these public institutions depends on their being able\nto provide assurance to society\u2019s members that everyone will be\nsubject to the same terms and obligations, and that their\ncontributions and cooperation will be reciprocated by others (Neufeld\n2009, 43). While other social institutions in a well-ordered society,\nsuch as religions or cultural institutions, may have profound effects\nof many members of a society, it remains possible for individual to\nreject their authority and jurisdiction. Hence they are\n\u201cvoluntary\u201d associations in a way that the state is not\n(Neufeld 2009, 42).\n\nNeufeld, following Susan Moller Okin (See Okin 1994 and 2005), argues\nthat in Rawls\u2019 later writings he treats the structure of the\nfamily in particular as more like one of these voluntary associations,\nrather than properly part of the basic structure, and so does not fall\nwithin the scope of principles of justice. However, Neufeld points out\nthat in contemporary liberal states there are a wide range of coercive\nlaws and state-organized facilities that regulate family structure and\nthe possibilities for association there, thus making it much more an\neffect of state coercive power than are religions, cultural\nassociations, and many other forms of private association. Thus the\nstate is more directly implicated in the structure of the family than\nRawls or Cohen seem to register. (See here also Brake 2012 for the\nways in which state power constitutes legal marriage.)\n3.4.4 Does state coercion need special justification?\n\nA different aspect of Rawls\u2019 approach holds that coercion is\nitself a distinctive political activity, and distinctively in need of\njustification to the members of a polity. Rawls here accepts what\nseems to be a broadly held view that coercion is an especially\nproblematic way for one party or entity to treat another party, which,\nif right, makes the issue of how to justify its use by the state\npressing. One might ground this view in the concern Kant expresses in\nthe \u201cformula of humanity\u201d: \u201cSo act that you use\nhumanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other,\nalways at the same time as an end, never merely as a means\u201d\n(Kant 1997 [1787], AK 4:429). To coerce someone appears to be a\nparadigmatic way of overriding their own decision about what they\nshould do, and directing their will to serve one\u2019s own purposes,\nrather than purposes of their own, thus treating them solely as a\nmeans rather than as an end themselves. As Charles Larmore puts the\npoint, \u201cthe distinctive feature of persons is that they are\nbeings capable of thinking and acting on the basis of reasons. If we\ntry to bring about conformity to a political principle simply by\nthreat, we will be treating people solely as means, as objects of\ncoercion. We will not also be treating them as ends, engaging directly\ntheir distinctive capacity as persons\u201d (Larmore 1996, 137; see\nalso Pallikkathayil 2016, 174).\n\nFor this reason, many liberals hold that state coercion must be\nsubjected to some further constraint or justification that that\nexplains how at least some exercises of coercion are consistent with\ntreating those who are coerced as ends in themselves, and not merely\nmeans. Perhaps the dominant approach is one Gerald Gaus and\nChristopher J. Eberle have called \u201cjustificatory\nliberalism\u201d (which Eberle associates also with the work of\nliberals such as Rawls, Larmore, and Robert Audi) which makes the\njustification of coercion its central mission. \u201cThe claim that\nrespect requires public justification provides a basis for the central\ncomponent of the justificatory liberal\u2019s ethic of citizenship:\nthe norm of respect imposes an obligation on each citizen to\ndiscipline herself in such a way that she resolutely refrains from\nsupporting any coercive law for which she cannot provide the requisite\npublic justification\u201d (Eberle 2002, 12, emphasis omitted; see\nalso Gaus 2010).\n\nThere is now a very large literature, arising out of\nRawls-interpretive scholarship, attempting and criticizing this\njustificatory task, which extends well beyond the issues raised by\nstate coercion; this entry is not suited to address it in any detail.\n(See instead the Stanford Encyclopedia entries on\n\u201cPublic Reason,\u201d \u201cPublic Justification,\u201d\n\u201cLiberalism\u201d and \u201cPolitical Legitimacy.\u201d) But\nrelevant here are some rebuttal arguments that reject or qualify the\nclaim that the state\u2019s use of coercion is especially in need of\nsuch justification. Several authors have argued that state uses of\ncoercion are not necessarily problematic in a way that encumbers them\nwith a special justificatory burden, or at least not a burden that is\nowed to those subjected to state coercion.\n\nIn response to the presumption against state coercion that motivates\nthe liberal justificatory projects, Andrew Lister raises a number of\nobjections to such a presumption (Lister 2010). While Lister\nacknowledges that paternalistic uses of coercion\u2014aimed at the\nwell-being of those coerced\u2014would be hard to justify against\nthose whose choices are overridden for their own good, he argues that\nother exercises of state coercion may be more defensible than the\n\u201creasonable rejectability\u201d test would seem to allow. He\nargues that although there may be disagreements based in publicly\nacceptable reasons about whether a particular use of coercion may be\nwarranted or desirable, a polity\u2019s citizens might reasonably\nagree to accept, say, authorizing a government to enact a set of\ncoercive policies (which may include some that some individuals would\nreject), rather than requiring that each individual policy be tested\nfor reasonable rejectability, which might result in all of them being\nrejected by someone or another. That is, it may be reasonably\nunrejectable to adopt as a compromise a process that enacts some\ncoercive state policies that are, as a package, preferred by everyone\nin comparison to a situation in which nearly all uses of coercion are\ndisabled by one or another party\u2019s specific reasonable objection\nto it. This solution is one Joseph Chan, developing the idea from\nThomas Nagel, calls the \u201cprinciple of higher-order\nunanimity\u201d: if people can and should unanimously agree that a\nstate must use coercion out of practical necessity, then this\nprinciple can be adopted as reasonably unrejectable, and then used to\njustify specific coercive policies even if some citizens might\nsubsequently have reasonable objections to those particular policies\n(Chan 2000, Nagel 1995).\n\nLister defends this proposal against objections from Gaus\u2019s\nliberal neutrality (Gaus 2003) that hold state coercion to be\ndistinctively problematic, and so demand that every coercive state\naction be individually vetted for reasonable rejectability. For one\nthing, Lister points out that policies that invoke state coercion may\ndiffer in their acceptability depending on what other policies are in\nplace. He offers as an illustration that it may be reasonable to favor\nstronger property rights against the state in a society with broadly\negalitarian distribution of wealth, whereas it may be more justifiable\nto allow eminent domain to override property owners\u2019 rights\nwhere there is broad inequality of ownership and little redistributive\ntaxation (Lister 2010, 158). Moreover, state coercion is often used to\ncombat private coercion, or other harms of a similarly disruptive\ncharacter; it is not obvious that we should prefer a state that allows\nprivate coercion to one that uses coercion itself against private\ncoercion. Furthermore, Lister argues, it is also unclear how to\nmeasure the extent of coercion as an output of a state\u2019s policy\nchoices, which is another obstacle to a presumption against state\ncoercion for the sake of avoiding coercion more generally.\n\nColin Bird also argues against the view that being coerced by the\nstate is a distinctive ground necessitating that coercers justify\ntheir actions to the coercees. He argues that other ways in which a\nmajority might exclude equal protection to minorities not involving\ncoercion would be similarly problematic, suggesting that the problem\nwith state coercion is not specifically due to the effect of coercion\non those coerced. For instance, if a state organized a voluntary cash\nlottery to fund some sectarian mission, making it independent of the\nuse of taxation, he argues that this would raise similar problems of\nreasonable rejectability by those whose interests are ignored by this\nprogram. Moreover, he notes that objections to coercion need not be\ndue to its effect on those coerced: people might even reasonably\nobject to a coercive policies even if they are immune to that\ncoercion, as a male might reasonably object to laws forbidding\nabortion even if he is not liable to suffer its enforcement (Bird\n2014, 198). Bird instead thinks that because the state acts on behalf\nof all of its citizens, the requirement of public justification\nattaches to its decision because they speak on behalf of everyone, and\nso should be justifiable to all as co-authors of those decisions. But\nthis then severs the need for public justification from the coercive\nquality of some of those decisions.\n\nIn a similar vein, Niko Kolodny and Christopher Morris contest the\nsignificance of the state\u2019s use of coercion to the question of\nwhether state power can be legitimate by liberalism\u2019s lights.\nKolodny registers the concerns of civic republicans that it\u2019s\nthe state\u2019s superior power to coerce that makes it suspect.\nHowever, he thinks that this is based in a misdiagnosis of the concern\nabout the state; our worry about the state would be justified even if\nthe state maintained its supremacy without the use of coercion, but\nrather just had widespread public assent to its decisions. Ultimately,\nhe holds that concern with coercion stems more from how the power of\nthe state seems to impugn the equality and self-sovereignty of the\nmembers of society, and not from any special threat it poses to the\nfreedom of its subjects (Kolodny 2016, 2017 and 2018). Morris argues\ncoercion is just one tool that states use to gain compliance with\ntheir decisions. Possessing \u201cauthority\u201d is sufficient to\ngain compliance in many decisions from at least many people, and so is\nsimilarly in need of justification if coercion is. \u201cOne does not\nunderstand law and, more generally, states if one does not see\ncoercion and force as supplementary to authority. Coercion\nand force are needed when the state\u2019s claimed authority is\nunappreciated, defective, or absent. Unjust states, recognized widely\nas such, will need to rely heavily on force; just states presumably\nneed much less force\u201d (Morris 2012, 40 (Morris\u2019\nemphasis)). On these views, then, even if state coercion requires\njustification, it isn\u2019t a distinctively important factor in need\nof special justification.\n\nLastly, Pallikkathayil argues that the question of how state coercion\ncan be justified to those coerced is wrongly posed. Developing a\nKantian approach (similar to that elaborated at greater length by\nArthur Ripstein in Ripstein 2009), Pallikkathayil argues that states\nare instituted to allow people to live their lives in association with\nothers in a way that allows all to be mutually independent through a\nsystem of rights that prevent unjust interference in one\nanother\u2019s choices. States are required in order to specify those\nrights, adjudicate claims in the breach, and enforce those judgments\nso people may rely on them. With this story as background,\nPallikkathayil asks:\n\n\n[W]hat I am doing when I coerce someone by subjecting her to liberal\npolitical institutions and laws. I am actually trying to treat her as\nindependent by putting her in the only circumstances in which she can\nbe free to live her life as she sees fit consistently with everyone\nelse doing so as well. And this remains the case even if she\nreasonably disagrees with me about the justification for the state\njust given. So, on this view, what is distinctive about permissible\ncoercion is that it is consistent with\u2014and in the case of the\nstate\u2019s use of coercion, needed for\u2014mutual independence,\nrather than that it makes contact with the viewpoints of others in a\nparticular way. (Pallikkathayil 2016, 177)\n\n\nPallikkathayil then argues that this account of the function of a\nstate, with coercion being an essential tool for it to carry out this\nfunction, has the advantage of restricting uses of state power to\nthose that facilitate or at least are compatible with this aim of\nmutual independence, while providing a justification for necessary\ncoercion that doesn\u2019t depend on the particular values of the\nsociety\u2019s members. \u201c[A]n advantage of the Kantian\u2019s\naccount of permissible coercion is that it looks to capture what is\nintuitively most problematic about impermissible coercion.\nImpermissible coercion involves trying to make a decision for another\nthat one is not entitled to make. The possibility that we might\ndisagree about what decision to make is orthogonal to this\nconcern\u201d (Pallikkathayil 2016, 183). Hence, similar to the way\nthe Nagel/Lister appeal to a principle of higher-order unanimity\nshort-cuts the need to justify specific policies involving coercion,\nPallikkathayil\u2019s Kantian approach justifies the coerciveness of\nthe state more generally, with justification of specific coercive\npolicies coming in at a subsidiary step where the use of coercion is\nalready pre-cleared, in a sense.\n3.4.5 Does state coercion generate special obligations for its citizens?\n\nThe third topic arising from Rawls\u2019 framework is the issue of\nwhether participation in a society governed by a coercive state\ngenerates distinctive obligations to co-nationals, because of that\nmutual susceptibility to coercion, or whether political obligations\nare unaffected by this mutual susceptibility. Rawls famously limited\nthe applicability of the principles of justice to the boundaries of a\nsingle polity, \u201ca closed system isolated from other\nsocieties\u201d (Rawls 1999 [1971], 7; see also Rawls 1993);\nrelations between different polities and people across borders were\ntaken to be governed according to other principles. For Rawls, the\nsubject of justice is \u201cthe major social institutions [that]\ndistribute fundamental rights and duties and determine the division of\nadvantages from social cooperation,\u201d (Rawls 1999 [1971], 6), the\nprinciples of justice apply only to those united in a society that\nforms the basis of such social cooperation.\n\nWhile this limitation has been contested, Michael Blake and Mathias\nRisse argue that it can be supported by consideration of the coercive\nnature of the state. The necessity of state coercion puts citizens of\na single state in a kind of relationship to one another that differs\nfrom their relationship to those outside their state. Blake holds that\na duty to promote economic equality as a matter of justice \u201cis a\nplausible interpretation of liberal principles only when those\nprinciples are applied to individuals who share liability to the\ncoercive network of state governance\u201d (Blake, 2002, 258). Risse\nsimilarly accepts that states (though not just states) may bear\nspecial obligations to those they govern due to their use of coercion\nover those under their authority (Risse 2006). Risse however stresses\nthat it is the immediacy of the sort of legal and political coercion\nstates exercise over their subjects that gives those subjects special\nclaim to just treatment from their states and fellow citizens.\n\nThomas Nagel reasons likewise to a similar conclusion, and extends it\nto justify the exclusion of immigrants from a state.\n\u201cImmigration policies are simply enforced against the nationals\nof other states; the laws are not imposed in their name, nor are they\nasked to accept and uphold those laws. Since no acceptance is demanded\nof them, no justification is required that explains why they should\naccept such discriminatory policies, or why their interests have been\ngiven equal consideration. It is sufficient justification to claim\nthat the policies do not violate their prepolitical human\nrights\u201d (Nagel 2005, 129\u201330). Against this view, the use\nof coercion to exclude non-citizens from a state has been argued to\nviolate basic rights (Huemer 2010) and principles of democratic theory\n(Abizadeh 2008; for objections and replies, see Miller 2009 and 2010;\nand Abizadeh 2010). As the next section will further explore, coercion\nacross state borders is also a contentious issue.\n\nIn response to positions like that of Blake, Risse, and Nagel, Andrea\nSangiovanni argues that people do not accrue special obligations to\ntheir fellow citizens just because they are mutually and\nnon-voluntarily liable to being coerced for the sake of their common\nwell-being (Sangiovanni 2012). While justice may constrain what sort\nor extent of coercive \u201cwill-bending\u201d can be justified,\nSangiovanni argues that being mutually subjected to coercion does not\nchange what obligations one has to others similarly situated. While\nnot ruling out that there may be obligations arising from being\nmembers of the same society, if such members have more demanding\nobligations to share the wealth with fellow members than with\noutsiders, this can\u2019t be explained just by their common\nsubjection to coercion. (For a reply to Sangiovanni friendly to\nBlake\u2019s position, see MacKay 2016.)\n\nFor a discussion of the sub-legal and super-legal uses of coercion in\ndomestic and international settings, see the supplementary\ndocument:\n\nApplications for Theories of Coercion\n\n",
