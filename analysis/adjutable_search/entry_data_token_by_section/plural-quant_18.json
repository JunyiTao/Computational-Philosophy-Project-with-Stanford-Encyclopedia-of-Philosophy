    "main_text": "Ontological Innocence? || The direct argument\n5.3 The direct argument\n\nPerhaps the most popular argument for Ontological Innocence is the one\nto which I now turn. In its simplest form, this argument is based on\nour intuitions about ontological commitments. When you assert\n (18),\n you don\u2019t have the feeling that you are committing yourself\nontologically to a collection or to any other kind of\n\u201cset-like\u201d object. Nor do you have any such feeling when\nyou assert the Geach-Kaplan sentence or any other translation of a\nsentence of PFO or PFO+ into English. Or so the argument goes.\n\nIn this simple form the argument is vulnerable to the objection that\npeople\u2019s intuitions provide a poor basis for settling\ntheoretical disputes about ontological commitments. We have seen that\nthere are competent speakers of English, such as Michael Resnik, who\ndon\u2019t share these intuitions. Moreover, as Davidson\u2019s\npopular analysis of action sentences in terms of events makes clear,\nordinary people\u2019s intuitions about ontological commitments\ncannot always be trusted (Davidson 1967). For instance, someone may\nsincerely assert that John walked slowly, without being aware that he\nhas committed himself to the existence of an event (namely a walking\nwhich was by John and which was slow).\n\nAlthough this objection has force, the argument can be sharpened by\nundertaking a more careful study of what forms of existential\ngeneralization are warranted on a sentence containing plural\nexpressions (Boolos 1984: 447 [1998a: 70]; McKay 2006: ch. 2; Yi 2002:\n7\u201315 and 2005: 469\u2013472). For instance, we may ask whether\nthe following can be inferred from\n (18):\n\n(21)\n There is an object such that Boolos ate all of its elements (or\nconstituents) for breakfast on January 1, 1985.\n\n\nThis inference would no doubt be quite peculiar. This provides\nevidence that\n (18)\n isn\u2019t committed to any kind of \u201cset-like\u201d\nentity.\n\nHowever, this evidence is not incontestable. For there are analogous\ninferences that seem quite natural. For instance, from\n\n(22)\n Some students surrounded the building.\n\n\nmost speakers of English would be perfectly happy to infer that \n\n(23)\n A group of students surrounded the building.\n\n\nSo perhaps the peculiarity of the inference from\n (18)\n to\n (21)\n is a pragmatic rather than a semantic phenomenon. Perhaps it has to\ndo with the fact that it is less natural to regard some Cheerios as a\nset (or some other sort of plural entity) than it is to regard some\nstudents as a group. \n\nHowever, let\u2019s assume that the defenders of the Direct Argument\nare right that\n (18)\n does not entail\n (21).\n What would follow? It would follow that\n (18)\n does not incur any additional ontological commitments of the sort\nthat can be incurred by singular first-order quantifiers. But\nthis conclusion falls short of the argument\u2019s desired conclusion\nthat\n (18)\n does not incur any additional ontological commitments of any\nsort. In order to get from the actual conclusion to the desired\none, we would in addition have to assume that all ontological\ncommitments are of the sort incurred by singular first-order\nquantifiers. But there is an influential philosophical tradition that\ndenies this assumption and instead holds that all kinds of quantifiers\nincur ontological commitments, not just singular first-order\n ones.[15]\n The most famous exponent of this tradition is Frege, who claims that\nsecond-order quantifiers are committed to concepts, just as singular\nfirst-order quantifiers are committed to objects. This tradition ties\nthe notion of ontological commitment very closely to that of a\nsemantic value. This will be the topic of the next and final\nsubsection.\n",
