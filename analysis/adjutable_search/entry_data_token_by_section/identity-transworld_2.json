    "main_text": "Transworld identity and Leibniz\u2019s Law\n2. Transworld identity and Leibniz\u2019s Law\n\nThere may seem to be an obvious objection to the employment of\ntransworld identity to interpret or paraphrase statements such as\n\u2018Bertrand Russell could have been a playwright\u2019 or\n\u2018George Eliot might have been a scientist\u2019. A fundamental\nprinciple about (numerical) identity is Leibniz\u2019s Law: the\nprinciple that if A is identical with B, then any\nproperty of A is a property of B, and vice versa. In\nother words, according to Leibniz\u2019s Law, identity requires the\nsharing of all properties; thus any difference between the properties\nof A and B is sufficient to show that A and\nB are numerically distinct. (The principle here referred to\nas \u2018Leibniz\u2019s Law\u2019 is also known as the\nIndiscernibility of Identicals. It must be distinguished from another\n(more controversial) Leibnizian principle, the Identity of\nIndiscernibles, which says that if A and B share all\ntheir properties then A is identical with B.)\nHowever, the whole point of asserting a transworld identity is to\nrepresent the fact that an individual could have had somewhat\ndifferent properties from its actual properties. Yet does not\n(for example) the claim that a philosopher in the actual world is\nidentical with a non-philosopher in some other possible world conflict\nwith Leibniz\u2019s Law?\n\nIt is generally agreed that this objection can be answered, and the\nappearance of conflict with Leibniz\u2019s Law eliminated. We can\nnote that the objection, if sound, would apparently prove too much,\nsince a parallel objection would imply that there can be no such thing\nas genuine (numerical) identity through change of properties over\ntime. But it is generally accepted that no correct interpretation of\nLeibniz\u2019s Law should rule this out. For example, Bertrand\nRussell was thrice married when he received the Nobel Prize for\nLiterature; the one-year-old Bertrand Russell was, of course,\nunmarried; does Leibniz\u2019s Law force us to deny the identity of\nthe prize-winning adult with the infant, on the grounds that they\ndiffer in their properties? No, for it seems that the appearance of\nconflict with Leibniz\u2019s Law can be dispelled, most obviously by\nsaying that the infant and the adult share the properties of being\nmarried in 1950 and being unmarried in 1873, but\nalternatively by the proposal that the correct interpretation of\nLeibniz\u2019s Law is that the identity of A and B\nrequires that there be no time such that A and B\nhave different properties at that time (cf. Loux 1979,\n42\u201343; also Chisholm 1967). However, it seems that exactly\nsimilar moves are available in the modal case to accommodate\n\u2018change\u2019 of properties across possible worlds. Either we\nmay claim that the actual Bertrand Russell and the playwright in some\npossible world (say, w2) are alike in possessing\nthe properties of being a philosopher in the actual world and\nbeing a non-philosopher in w2, or we may argue\nthat Leibniz\u2019s Law, properly interpreted, asserts that the\nidentity of A and B requires that there be no time,\nand no possible world, such that A and B have\ndifferent properties at that time and world. The moral\nappears to be that transworld identity claims (combined with the view\nthat some of an individual\u2019s properties could have been\ndifferent) need no more be threatened by Leibniz\u2019s Law than is\nthe view that there can be identity over time combined with change of\nproperties (Loux 1979, 42\u201343).\n\nIt should be mentioned, however, that David Lewis has argued that the\nreconciliation of identity through change over time with\nLeibniz\u2019s Law suggested above is oversimplified, and gives rise\nto a \u2018problem of temporary intrinsics\u2019 that can be solved\nonly by treating a persisting thing that changes over time as composed\nof temporal parts that do not change their intrinsic properties. (See\nLewis 1986, 202\u2013204, and for discussion and further references,\nHawley 2001; Sider 2001; Lowe 2002; Haslanger 2003.) In addition, it\nis partly because Lewis regards the analogous account of transworld\nidentity in terms of modal parts as an unacceptable solution to an\nanalogous \u2018problem of accidental intrinsics\u2019 that Lewis\nrejects transworld identity in favour of counterpart theory (Lewis\n1986, 199\u2013220; cf. Section 1.2 above).\n",
