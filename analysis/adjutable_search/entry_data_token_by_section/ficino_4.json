This number encompassed all those works contained in the nine\ntetralogies (some now considered spurious), an arrangement attributed\nby Diogenes Laertius (Diog.  Laert., 3.59) to Thrasyllus (possibly the\notherwise unknown court astrologer to Tiberius); included were\nthirty-five dialogues and the Platonic\nLetters. All of these translations were complete in draft\nform by 1468\u201369 (Hankins 1989, 300\u201318). After the\ncompletion of the Platonic Theology, Ficino returned to them,\nwriting commentaries along the way, and in October 1484, the work was\nprinted. This year was almost certainly chosen for astrological\nreasons, since it appeared to contemporary astrologers to portend\ngreat matters, occurring as it did during a conjunction of Jupiter and\nSaturn (Hankins 1989, 303). Ficino was especially eager to get this\nwork into print, it seems, as he included only a few commentaries;\nalthough he did provide \u201cargumenta,\u201d or short summaries of\nthe Platonic works, his fuller Commentaries on Plato waited\nanother twelve years for publication.\n\n\nAs mentioned, Ficino lived in an era when\ninterpretive exegesis represented a form of philosophical\ncomposition. He believed, on the one hand, that he needed to bring out\nthe philosophical truth for his own times and, moreover, that the\ntruth was contained in Plato\u2019s works. On the other hand, these works\nwere filled with dialogical ambiguity and passages which, if not read\ncarefully, could prove dangerous if not overtly heretical. So Ficino\u2019s\nenterprise of translation was as much designed to render the texts\nthemselves from Greek into Latin as it was to translate Plato, and\nindeed the entire \u201cancient theology\u201d of which Plato had\nbeen the prime representative, into the cultural idiom of the late\nmedieval and Renaissance world in which Ficino found himself.\n",
