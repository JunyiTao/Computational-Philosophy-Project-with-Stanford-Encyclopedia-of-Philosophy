But what does this freedom come to? The freedom to do\notherwise is clearly a modal property of agents, but it is\ncontroversial just what species of modality is at stake. It must be\nmore than mere possibility: to have the freedom to do\notherwise consists in more than the mere possibility of something\nelse\u2019s happening. A more plausible and widely endorsed\nunderstanding claims the relevant modality is ability or\npower (Locke 1690 [1975], II.xx; Reid 1788 [1969],\nII.i\u2013ii; D. Locke 1973; Clarke 2009; Vihvelin 2013). But\nabilities themselves seem to come in different varieties (Lewis 1976;\nHorgan 1979; van Inwagen 1983, ch. 1; Mele 2003; Clarke 2009; Vihvelin\n2013, ch. 1; Franklin 2015; Cyr and Swenson 2019; Hofmann 2022;\nWhittle 2022), so a claim that an agent has \u2018the ability to do\notherwise\u2019 is potentially ambiguous or indeterminate; in\nphilosophical discussion, the sense of ability appealed to needs to be\nspelled out. A satisfactory account of the freedom to do otherwise\nowes us both an account of the kind of ability in terms of which the\nfreedom to do otherwise is analyzed, and an argument for why this kind\nof ability (as opposed to some other species) is the one constitutive\nof the freedom to do otherwise. As we will see, philosophers sometimes\nleave this second debt unpaid.\n\nThe contemporary literature takes its cue from classical\ncompatibilism\u2019s recognized failure to deliver a satisfactory\nanalysis of the freedom to do otherwise. As we saw above, classical\ncompatibilists (Hobbes 1654 [1999], 1656 [1999]; Locke 1690 [1975];\nHume 1740 [1978], 1748 [1975]; Edwards 1754 [1957]; Moore 1912;\nSchlick 1939; Ayer 1954) sought to analyze the freedom to do otherwise\nin terms of a simple conditional analysis of ability:\n\nSimple Conditional Analysis: An agent \\(S\\) has the\nability to do otherwise if and only if, were \\(S\\) to choose to do\notherwise, then \\(S\\) would do otherwise.\n\n\nPart of the attraction of this analysis is that it obviously\nreconciles the freedom to do otherwise with determinism. While the\ntruth of determinism entails that one\u2019s action is inevitable\ngiven the past and laws of nature, there is nothing about determinism\nthat implies that if one had chosen otherwise, then one would\nnot do otherwise.\n\nThere are two problems with the Simple Conditional\nAnalysis. The first is that it is, at best, an analysis of\nfree action, not free will (cf. Reid 1788 [1969]; Chisholm 1966; 1976,\nch. 2; Lehrer 1968, 1976). It only tells us when an agent has the\nability to do otherwise, not when an agent has the ability to\nchoose to do otherwise. One might be tempted to think that\nthere is an easy fix along the following lines:\n\nSimple Conditional Analysis*: An agent \\(S\\) has the\nability to choose otherwise if and only if, were \\(S\\) to desire or\nprefer to choose otherwise, then \\(S\\) would choose otherwise.\n\n\nThe problem is that we often fail to choose to do things we want to\nchoose, even when it appears that we had the ability to choose\notherwise (one might think the same problem attends the original\nanalysis). Suppose that, in deciding how to spend my evening, I have a\ndesire to choose to read and a desire to choose to watch a movie.\nSuppose that I choose to read. By all appearances, I had the ability\nto choose to watch a movie. And yet, according to the Simple\nConditional Analysis*, I lack this freedom, since the\nconditional \u2018if I were to desire to choose to watch a movie,\nthen I would choose to watch a movie\u2019 is false. I do desire to\nchoose to watch a movie and yet I do not choose to watch a movie. It\nis unclear how to remedy this problem. On the one hand, we might\nrefine the antecedent by replacing \u2018desire\u2019 with\n\u2018strongest desire\u2019 (cf. Hobbes 1654 [1999], 1656 [1999];\nEdwards 1754 [1957]). The problem is that this assumes, implausibly,\nthat we always choose what we most strongly desire (for criticisms of\nthis view see Reid 1788 [1969]; Campbell 1951; Wallace 1999; Holton\n2009). On the other hand, we might refine the consequent by replacing\n\u2018would choose to do otherwise\u2019 with either \u2018would\nprobably choose to do otherwise\u2019 or \u2018might choose to do\notherwise\u2019. But each of these proposals is also problematic. If\n\u2018probably\u2019 means \u2018more likely than not\u2019, then\nthis revised conditional still seems too strong: it seems possible to\nhave the ability to choose otherwise even when one\u2019s so choosing\nis unlikely. If we opt for \u2018might\u2019, then the relevant\nsense of modality needs to be spelled out.\n\nEven if there are fixes to these problems, there is a yet deeper\nproblem with these analyses. There are some agents who clearly lack\nthe freedom to do otherwise and yet satisfy the conditional at the\nheart of these analyses. That is, although these agents lack the\nfreedom to do otherwise, it is, for example, true of them that\nif they chose otherwise, they would do otherwise. Picking up\non an argument developed by Keith Lehrer (1968; cf. Campbell 1951;\nBroad 1952; Chisholm 1966), consider an agoraphobic, Luke, who, when\nfaced with the prospect of entering an open space, is subject not\nmerely to an irresistible desire to refrain from intentionally going\noutside, but an irresistible desire to refrain from even\nchoosing to go outside. Given Luke\u2019s psychology, there\nis no possible world in which he suffers from his agoraphobia and\nchooses to go outside. It may well nevertheless be true that\nif Luke chose to go outside, then he would have gone outside.\nAfter all, any possible world in which he chooses to go outside will\nbe a world in which he no longer suffers (to the same degree) from his\nagoraphobia, and thus we have no reason to doubt that in those worlds\nhe would go outside as a result of his choosing to go outside. The\nsame kind of counterexample applies with equal force to the\nconditional \u2018if \\(S\\) desired to choose otherwise, then \\(S\\)\nwould choose otherwise\u2019.\n\nWhile simple conditional analyses admirably make clear the species of\nability to which they appeal, they fail to show that this species of\nability is constitutive of the freedom to do otherwise. Agents need a\nstronger ability to do otherwise than characterized by such simple\nconditionals. Some argue that the fundamental source of the above\nproblems is the conditional nature of these analyses\n(Campbell 1951; Austin 1961; Chisholm 1966; Lehrer 1976; van Inwagen\n1983, ch. 4). The sense of ability relevant to the freedom to do\notherwise is the \u2018all-in sense\u2019\u2014that is, holding\neverything fixed up to the time of the decision or action\u2014and\nthis sense, so it is argued, can only be captured by a categorical\nanalysis of the ability to do otherwise:\n\nCategorical Analysis: An agent \\(S\\) has the ability\nto choose or do otherwise than \\(\\phi\\) at time \\(t\\) if and only if\nit was possible, holding fixed everything up to \\(t\\), that \\(S\\)\nchoose or do otherwise than \\(\\phi\\) at \\(t\\).\n\n\nThis analysis gets the right verdict in Luke\u2019s case. He lacks\nthe ability to do otherwise than refrain from choosing to go outside,\naccording to this analysis, because there is no possible world in\nwhich he suffers from his agoraphobia and yet chooses to go outside.\nUnlike the above conditional analyses, the Categorical\nAnalysis requires that we hold fixed Luke\u2019s agoraphobia\nwhen considering alternative possibilities.\n\nIf the Categorical Analysis is correct, then free\nwill is incompatible with determinism. According to the thesis of\ndeterminism, all deterministic possible worlds with the same pasts and\nlaws of nature have the same futures (Lewis 1979; van Inwagen 1983,\n3). Suppose John is in deterministic world \\(W\\) and refrains from\nraising his hand at time \\(t\\). Since \\(W\\) is deterministic, it\nfollows that any possible world \\(W^*\\) that has the same past and\nlaws up to \\(t\\) must have the same future, including John\u2019s\nrefraining from raising his hand at \\(t\\). Therefore, John lacked the\nability, and thus freedom, to raise his hand.\n\nThis argument, carefully articulated in the late 1960s and early 1970s\nby Carl Ginet (1966, 1990) and Peter van Inwagen (1975, 1983) and\nrefined in important ways by John Martin Fischer (1994), has come to\nbe known as the Consequence Argument. van Inwagen offers the following\ninformal statement of the argument:\n\n\nIf determinism is true, then our acts are the consequences of the laws\nof nature and events in the remote past. But it is not up to us what\nwent on before we were born [i.e., we do not have the ability to\nchange the past], and neither is it up to us what the laws of nature\nare [i.e., we do not have the ability to break the laws of nature].\nTherefore, the consequences of these things (including our present\nacts) are not up to us. (van Inwagen 1983, 16; cf. Fischer 1994, ch.\n1)\n\n\nLike the Simple Conditional Analysis, a virtue of the\nCategorical Analysis is that it spells out clearly\nthe kind of ability appealed to in its analysis of the freedom to do\notherwise, but like the Simple Conditional Analysis,\ncritics have argued that the sense of ability it captures is not the\nsense at the heart of free will. The objection here, though, is not\nthat the analysis is too permissive or weak, but rather that it is too\nrestrictive or strong.\n\nWhile there have been numerous different replies along these lines\n(e.g., Lehrer 1980; Slote 1982; Watson 1986. See the entry on\n arguments for incompatibilism\n for a more extensive discussion of and bibliography for the\nConsequence Argument), the most influential of these objections is due\nto David Lewis (1981). Lewis contended that van Inwagen\u2019s\nargument equivocated on \u2018is able to break a law of\nnature\u2019. We can distinguish two senses of \u2018is able to\nbreak a law of nature\u2019:\n\n(Weak Thesis) I am able to do something such that, if I did it, a law\nof nature would be broken.\n\n(Strong Thesis) I am able to do something such that, if I did it, it\nwould constitute a law of nature\u2019s being broken or would cause a\nlaw of nature to be broken.\n\nIf we are committed to the Categorical Analysis, then\nthose desiring to defend compatibilism seem to be committed to the\nsense of ability in \u2018is able to break a law of nature\u2019\nalong the lines of the strong thesis. Lewis agrees with van Inwagen\nthat it is \u201cincredible\u201d to think humans have such an\nability (Lewis 1981, 113), but maintains that compatibilists need only\nappeal to the ability to break a law of nature in the weak sense.\nWhile it is absurd to think that humans are able to do something that\nis a violation of a law of nature or causes a law of\nnature to be broken, there is nothing incredible, so Lewis claimed, in\nthinking that humans are able to do something such that if\nthey did it, a law of nature would be broken. In essence, Lewis is\narguing that incompatibilists like van Inwagen have failed to\nadequately motivate the restrictiveness of the Categorical\nAnalysis.\n\nSome incompatibilists have responded to Lewis by contending that even\nthe weak ability is incredible (van Inwagen\n2004). But there is a different and often overlooked problem for\nLewis: the weak ability seems to be too weak. Returning to the case of\nJohn\u2019s refraining from raising his hand, Lewis maintains that\nthe following three propositions are consistent:\n\n(i)\nJohn is able to raise his hand.\n(ii)\nA necessary condition for John\u2019s raising his hand fails to\nobtain (i.e., that the laws of nature or past are different than they\nactually are).\n(iii)\nJohn is not able to do anything that would constitute this\nnecessary condition\u2019s obtaining or cause this necessary\ncondition to obtain (i.e., he is unable to do anything that would\nconstitute or cause a law of nature to be broken or the past to be\ndifferent).\n\n\nOne might think that (ii) and (iii) are incompatible with (i).\nConsider again Luke, our agoraphobic. Suppose that his agoraphobia\naffects him in such a way that he will only intentionally go outside\nif he chooses to go outside, and yet his agoraphobia makes it\nimpossible for him to make this choice. In this case, a necessary\ncondition for Luke\u2019s intentionally going outside is his choosing\nto go outside. Moreover, Luke is not able to choose or cause himself\nto choose to go outside. Intuitively, this would seem to imply that\nLuke lacks the freedom to go outside. But this implication\ndoes not follow for Lewis. From the fact that Luke is able to go\noutside only if he chooses to go outside and the fact that Luke is not\nable to choose to go outside, it does not follow, on\nLewis\u2019s account, that Luke lacks the ability to go outside.\nConsequently, Lewis\u2019s account fails to explain why Luke lacks\nthe ability to go outside (cf. Speak 2011). (For other important\ncriticisms of Lewis, see Ginet [1990, ch. 5] and Fischer [1994, ch.\n4].)\n\nWhile Lewis may be right that the Categorical\nAnalysis is too restrictive, his argument, all by itself,\ndoesn\u2019t seem to establish this. His argument is successful only\nif (a) he can provide an alternative analysis of ability that entails\nthat Luke\u2019s agoraphobia robs him of the ability to go outside\nand (b) does not entail that determinism robs John of the ability to\nraise his hand (cf. Pendergraft 2010). Lewis must point out a\nprincipled difference between these two cases. As should be clear from\nthe above, the Simple Conditional Analysis is of no\nhelp. However, some recent work by Michael Smith (2003), Kadri\nVihvelin (2004; 2013), and Michael Fara (2008) have attempted to fill\nthis gap. What unites these theorists\u2014whom Clarke (2009) has\ncalled the \u2018new dispositionalists\u2019\u2014is their attempt\nto appeal to recent advances in the metaphysics of dispositions to\narrive at a revised conditional analysis of the freedom to do\notherwise. The most perspicuous of these accounts is offered by\nVihvelin (2004), who argues that an agent\u2019s having the ability\nto do otherwise is solely a function of the agent\u2019s intrinsic\nproperties. (It is important to note that Vihvelin [2013] has come to\nreject the view that free will consists exclusively in the kind of\nability analyzed below.) Building on Lewis\u2019s work on the\nmetaphysics of dispositions, she arrives at the following analysis of\nability:\n\nRevised Conditional Analysis of Ability: \\(S\\) has\nthe ability at time \\(t\\) to do \\(X\\) iff, for some intrinsic property\nor set of properties \\(B\\) that \\(S\\) has at \\(t\\), for some time\n\\(t'\\) after \\(t\\), if \\(S\\) chose (decided, intended, or tried) at\n\\(t\\) to do \\(X\\), and \\(S\\) were to retain \\(B\\) until \\(t'\\),\n\\(S\\)\u2019s choosing (deciding, intending, or trying) to do \\(X\\)\nand \\(S\\)\u2019s having \\(B\\) would jointly be an \\(S\\)-complete\ncause of \\(S\\)\u2019s doing \\(X\\). (Vihvelin 2004, 438)\n\n\nLewis defines an \u2018\\(S\\)-complete cause\u2019 as \u201ca cause\ncomplete insofar as havings of properties intrinsic to [\\(S\\)] are\nconcerned, though perhaps omitting some events extrinsic to\n[\\(S\\)]\u201d (cf. Lewis 1997, 156). In other words, an\n\\(S\\)-complete cause of \\(S\\)\u2019s doing \\(\\phi\\) requires that\n\\(S\\) possess all the intrinsic properties relevant to \\(S\\)\u2019s\ncausing \\(S\\)\u2019s doing \\(\\phi\\). This analysis appears to afford\nVihvelin the basis for a principled difference between agoraphobics\nand merely determined agents. We must hold fixed an agent\u2019s\nphobias since they are intrinsic properties of agents, but we need not\nhold fixed the laws of nature because these are not intrinsic\nproperties of agents. (It should be noted that the assumption that\nintrinsic properties are wholly separable from the laws of nature is\ndisputed by \u2018dispositional essentialists.\u2019 See the entry\non\n metaphysics of causation.)\n Vihvelin\u2019s analysis appears to be restrictive enough to exclude\nphobics from having the freedom to do otherwise, but permissive enough\nto allow that some agents in deterministic worlds have the freedom to\ndo otherwise.\n\nBut appearances can be deceiving. The new dispositionalist claims have\nreceived some serious criticism, with the majority of the criticisms\nmaintaining that these analyses are still too permissive (Clarke 2009;\nWhittle 2010; Franklin 2011b). For example, Randolph Clarke argues\nthat Vihvelin\u2019s analysis fails to overcome the original problem\nwith the Simple Conditional Analysis. He writes,\n\u201cA phobic agent might, on some occasion, be unable to choose to\nA and unable to A without so choosing, while\nretaining all that she would need to implement such a choice, should\nshe make it. Despite lacking the ability to choose to A, the\nagent might have some set of intrinsic properties B such\nthat, if she chose to A and retained B, then her\nchoosing to A and her having B would jointly be an\nagent-complete cause of her A-ing\u201d (Clarke 2009, p.\n329).\n\nThe Categorical Analysis, and thus incompatibilism\nabout free will and determinism, remains an attractive option for many\nphilosophers precisely because it seems that compatibilists have yet\nto furnish an analysis of the freedom to do otherwise that implies\nthat phobics clearly lack the ability to choose or do otherwise that\nis relevant to moral responsibility and yet some merely determined\nagents have this ability.\n",
