    "main_text": "The Ontological Status of Species || Species as Homeostatic Property Cluster Kinds\n2.4 Species as Homeostatic Property Cluster Kinds\n\nAnother response to the species are individuals thesis is offered by\nproponents of an alternative approach to natural kinds. According to\nBoyd (1999a, 1999b), Griffiths (1999), Wilson (1999), Millikan (1999),\nand Wilson et al. (2007), species are natural kinds on a\nproper conception of natural kinds. These authors adopt Boyd\u2019s\nHomeostatic Property Cluster (HPC) theory of natural kinds. HPC theory\nassumes that natural kinds are groups of entities that share stable\nsimilarities. HPC theory does not require that species are defined by\ntraditional essential properties. The members of Canis\nfamiliaris, for example, tend to share a number of common\nproperties (having four legs, two eyes, and so on), but given the\nforces of evolution, no biological property is essential for\nmembership in that species. For HPC theory, the similarities among the\nmembers of a kind must be stable enough to allow better than chance\npredictions about the properties found among the members of a kind.\nFor instance, given that we know that Lizzy is a dog, we can predict\nwith greater than chance probability that Lizzy will have four\nlegs.\n\nHPC kinds are more than groups of entities that share stable clusters\nof similarities. HPC kinds also contain \u201chomeostatic causal\nmechanisms\u201d that are responsible for the similarities found\namong the members of a kind. The members of a biological species\ninterbreed, share common developmental programs, and are exposed to\ncommon selection regimes. These \u201chomeostatic mechanisms\u201d\ncause the members of a species to have similar features. Dogs, for\ninstance, tend to have four legs and two eyes because they share\ngenetic material and are exposed to common environmental pressures. An\nHPC kind consists of entities that share similarities induced by that\nkind\u2019s homeostatic mechanisms. According to Boyd, species are\nHPC kinds and thus natural kinds because \u201cspecies are defined\n\u2026 by \u2026 shared properties and by the mechanisms\n(including both \u201dexternal\u201c mechanisms and genetic\ntransmission) which sustain their homeostasis\u201d (1999b, 81).\n\nHPC theory provides a more promising account of species as natural\nkinds than essentialism. HPC kinds need not have a common essential\nproperty, so the criticisms of species essentialism are avoided.\nFurthermore, HPC theory allows that external relations play a\nsignificant role in causing similarity among the members of a kind.\nTraditional essentialism assumes that the essence of a kind is an\ninternal or intrinsic property of a kind\u2019s members, such as the\natomic structure of gold or the DNA of tigers. HPC theory is more\ninclusive because it recognizes that both the internal properties of\norganisms and the external relations of organisms are important causes\nof species-wide similarities. For instance, HPC theory but not\nessentialism cites interbreeding as a fundamental cause of similarity\namong the organisms of many species.\n\nWhile HPC theory is better at capturing the features of species than\nessentialism, does HPC theory provide an adequate account of species\nas natural kinds? Here are two potential problems with HPC theory. HPC\ntheory\u2019s objective is to explain the existence of stable\nsimilarities within groups of entities. However, species are also\ncharacterized by persistent differences. Polymorphism (stable\nvariation within a species) is an important feature of nearly every\nspecies. Species polymorphisms are easy to find. Consider sexual\ndimorphism: within any mammalian species there are pronounced\ndifferences between males and females. Or consider polymorphism in the\nlife cycles of organisms. The lives of organisms consist of\ndramatically different life stages, such as the difference between the\ncaterpillar and butterfly stages of a single organism. HPC theorists\nrecognize the existence of polymorphism, but they do not recognize\npolymorphism as a central feature of species in need of explanation.\nHPC theorists privilege and attempt to explain similarities. In\naddition to Boyd\u2019s \u2018homeostatic\u2019 mechanisms we need\nto recognize \u2018heterostatic\u2019 mechanisms that maintain\nspecies variation. (For further discussion of polymorphism in species\nsee Ereshefsky and Matthen 2005 and Magnus 2008.)\n\nA second concern with HPC theory involves the identity conditions of\nspecies. The members of a species vary in their traits. Moreover, they\nvary in their homeostatic mechanisms. Over time and across geographic\nregions, the members of a single species are often exposed to\ndifferent homeostatic mechanisms. Given such variation, what causes\norganisms with different traits and exposed to different homeostatic\nmechanisms to be members of the same species? The common answer is\ngenealogy: the members of a species form a continuous genealogical\nentity on the tree of life. A species\u2019 homeostatic mechanisms\nare mechanisms of one species because they affect organisms that form\na unique lineage. Boyd and promoters of HPC theory recognize the\nimportance of genealogy and see historical relations as one type of\nhomeostatic mechanism. However, Boyd does not see genealogy as the\ndefining aspect of species, and this goes against a fundamental\nassumption of biological systematics: species are first and foremost\ncontinuous genealogical entities. Boyd is quite clear that similarity\nand not genealogical connectedness is the final arbitrator of species\nsameness (1999b, 80). This assumption makes sense given that Boyd\nbelieves that species are kinds and kinds are ultimately\nsimilarity-based classes that play a role in induction. But this view\nof the identity conditions of species conflicts with the standard view\nin biological systematics that species are continuous genealogical\nlineages (Ereshefsky 2007).\n",
