The original Nagel model was faulted as too narrow\nbecause it allows only for theory reduction (Wimsatt 1972; Hull 1976;\nDarden & Maull 1977: 43; Sarkar 1992), whereas an appropriate\nmodel would cover cases of reduction of mere models and the\nlike\u2014sciences like biology and neuroscience should be regarded\nas being possible candidates for reduction, although they do not\ncontain full-fledged theories (see also the entry on\n reductionism in biology;\n for a discussion of this and the following criticisms, see van Riel\n2011).\n\nIn a more general sense, the Nagel model has been criticized as\nexemplifying all the shortcomings of the orthodox view on science. For\nexample, it conceives of theories as syntactic entities, and it views\nreduction as explanation cashed out in terms of the DN model (Hempel\n& Oppenheim 1948), which has itself been challenged on many\ngrounds, especially those regarding the asymmetry of explanation (for\nan overview that focuses on problems arising from reduction as\nexplanation, see Craver (2007: chap. 2), and for problems concerning\nthe DN model, see Salmon 1989).\n\nThe Nagel model describes reduction in terms of direct theory\nexplanation, whereas an appropriate model of reduction should shape\nthe notion in terms of indirect theory explanation, that is, in terms\nof explanation of the phenomena of a theory (Kemeny & Oppenheim\n1956; Schaffner 1967; Friedman 1982).\n\nThree formal worries of the Nagel model merit mention: if reduction is\nderivation plus (sometimes) bridge laws, then any theory would reduce\nto itself (because any theory is derivable from itself); moreover, any\ntheory would reduce to any inconsistent theory; and contrary to what\none might expect, reduction would not turn out to be an asymmetric\nrelation\u2014derivability does not entail asymmetry.\n\nFeyerabend (1962, 1966), Churchland (1986), Schaffner (1993), and\nBickle (1998), amongst others, have argued that Nagel\u2019s model\nallows neither for correction in the reducing theory nor for\nreplacement, and that, therefore, it is fundamentally misguided.\nRecall, however, that Nagel suggests that at least some interesting\nreductions involve correction. He writes that:\n\n\n[t]he [reducing] theory must also be fertile in usable suggestions for\ndeveloping the secondary science, and must yield theorems referring to\nthe latter\u2019s subject matter which augment or correct its\ncurrently accepted body of laws. (Nagel 1961: 360)\n\n\nAt first sight, it is not clear how correction is possible if\ndeduction is the basis for reduction. The truth of the reducing\ntheories entails the truth of the reduced theories. This is what\ndeduction is about. So, it is worth noting that Nagel introduced this\ncriterion, even though it seems hardly compatible with his official\nmodel. However, as suggested by Putnam (1965: 206ff., esp. n. 3),\nthere are a number of ways to incorporate correction within\nNagel\u2019s model: by speaking of approximate truth, by\ncontextualizing the reduced theory, or by introducing probabilistic\nnotions. Moreover, in discussing Feyerabend\u2019s criticisms based\non the alleged incommensurability of expressions in different\nsciences, Nagel explicitly stated that reductions may rely on\napproximations (1970: 120\u201321, 133). A similar idea seems tied to\nNagel\u2019s suggestion that some reductions may require boundary\nconditions (Nagel 1961: 434) in order to connect the relevant kind\nterms in an appropriate bridge law, thereby altering and adjusting one\nof the terms\u2019 extensions. As has been pointed out by Endicott\n(1998), any account that allows for boundary conditions, correction,\napproximation and the like (such as the account proposed by Schaffner)\nwill be able to cover such cases. Kemeny and Oppenheim suggest that\nidealization may be justified in developing models of reduction,\nnoting that without idealization things would become \u201chopelessly\ncomplex\u201d (Kemeny & Oppenheim 1956: 13).\n\nFinally, Nagel\u2019s model has been criticized for the role it\nattributes to bridge-laws. New Wave reductionists in particular have\nargued that bridge-laws do not play the role they are supposed to play\nin discovering reduction-relations. Contrary to Nagel, we do not use\nbridge-laws when discovering for example that parts of chemistry\nreduce to atomic physics. Rather, we infer bridge-laws from the\ndiscovery of relevant similarities between the two theories (for the\nexplanatory role of bridge-laws and identity statements, see also\nMarras (2005: 351) and Block & Stalnaker (1999: 28)).\n\nIn response to those critiques, some, like Schaffner and\nDizadji-Bahmani et al. (2010) and Butterfield (2011a&b) have\ndeveloped variants of the Nagel model that retain its spirit but avoid\nmany of the problems faced by the original. Prominent suggestions\nconcern refinements of the logical framework in which Nagelian\nreduction is described (Dizadji-Bahmani, Frigg, and Hartmann (2010)\nand Butterfield (2011a)) as well as a relaxation of the condition that\nreductions must be complete. The idea is that even in physics,\nreductions are \u201cmost likely partial, and thus not fully\nsystematic\u201d (Schaffner 2012: 559). As Schaffner observed, even\n\u201calmost sweeping reductions\u201d (Schaffner 2006: 379) in\nphysics, such as the reduction of physical optics by Maxwell\u2019s\nelectromagnetic theory, fail at some point. Partial reductions are\nconceived of as \u201clargely completed reductions containing\nexceptions or failures of attempted reductions\u201d (Schaffner 2012:\n563). An interpretation of partial reductions for sciences such as\nbiology has been developed in Schaffner (2006) and further developed\nby Winther (2009). His suggestion heavily draws on explanatory notions\nand mereological relations: In a partial reduction, the objects\nreferred to in the explanans are parts, or a microstructure of the\nphenomenon to be explained. The phenomenon to be explained is a\nmacro-object. The microstructure needs to be linked via\n\u201cconnectability assumptions\u201d to the macro-object. These\nassumptions may suggest causal links or, in more straightforward\ncases, identity. Such explanations may turn out to be partial for\nvarious reasons: For example, they often do not explain all cases of\nthe target phenomenon, the reduction base may span levels of\norganization, and they may fall short of straightforward derivations\nof the target phenomenon. Such partial reductions share important\nfeatures with mechanistic explanations; for example, they are local,\npostulate a causal mechanism that is responsible for the occurrence of\nthe target phenomenon, refer to constituents in the explanation, and\nmay span different levels.\n\nPartial reductions thus allow for emergence; we get a partial\nreduction only, some aspects of the target phenomenon are emergent. On\nSchaffner\u2019s interpretation, this sort of emergence is purely\npragmatic (Schaffner 2006: 382).\n\nOthers have rejected the Nagel model and used different frameworks to\naccount for reduction. The most relevant alternatives will be\ndiscussed in the next sections.\n",
