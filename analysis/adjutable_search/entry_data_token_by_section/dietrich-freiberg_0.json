    "main_text": "Life of Dietrich of Freiberg\n1. Life of Dietrich of Freiberg\n\n\nLittle is known with certainty about the life of Dietrich of\nFreiberg. He was born in Freiberg in Saxony around the year 1250. He\nis sometimes referred to as \u201cDietrich of Saxony,\u201d and\noften as \u201cTheodoricus Teutonicus.\u201d He is also mentioned in\nmedieval documents as \u201cMagister\u201d or \u201cMaster,\u201d\nindicating that he had advanced university training. He joined the\nDominican order at a young age. We know that he was still a youth when\nAlbertus Magnus was coming to the end of his career. But it is not\nknown whether Dietrich studied under Albert or ever met him. Around\nthe year 1271 he served as lector in the Dominican convent at Freiberg\nin Saxony. That he studied at Paris is clear, that it was sometime\nduring the period between 1272\u20131274 is probable. But it is not\nknown with whom he studied. There is evidence provided by Dietrich\u2019s\nown hand, found in chapter thirty of the second part of his\nTractatus de intellectu et intelligibili and in other places\nin his works that suggests he may have studied under Henry of Ghent.\nDietrich mentions a certain \u201csolemn master\u201d whom he heard\ndispute in Paris. Henry was known to his students as \u201cdoctor\nsolemnis\u201d and perhaps \u201cmagister solemnis\u201d as\nwell. An examination of Dietrich\u2019s writings suggests some themes that\ncould possibly owe their origins to Henry of Ghent. But the matter is\nuncertain, and it does not seem that a careful study of the writings\nof either of these great masters will reveal their historical\nrelations to one another.\n\n\nDietrich returned to Germany in 1280 and held the post of lector in\nthe city of Trier until 1281. He returned to Paris in 1281 in order to\nhold lectures on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, perhaps at\nSaint-Jacques. He may have remained in Paris until 1293. Although the\ndocuments are not clear, most historians agree that he was appointed\nprior of the Dominican convent in W\u00fcrzburg. In 1293 he was named\nProvincial Superior of his order for the province of Germany, Albert\nthe Great\u2019s old post. Somewhere between 1296 and 1297 he was made\n\u201cMaster of Theology\u201d at Paris. He continued to teach in\nParis until 1300. In 1304 he was present at the general chapter of the\nDominican order held at Toulouse. His name last appears in the acts of\nthe general chapter of the order held in Piacenza in 1310. There he\nwas appointed Vicar Provincial of Germany. After this time his name\ndrops out of the documents.(Eckert 1957/1959; Kandler 2009)\n",
