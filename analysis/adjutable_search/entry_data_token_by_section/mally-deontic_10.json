    "main_text": "Alternative Deontic Principles\n11. Conclusion\n\nMally\u2019s deontic logic is unacceptable for the reasons stated by Menger\n(1939). But it is not as bad as it may seem at first sight. Only\nrelatively minor modifications are needed to turn it into a more\nacceptable system. One may either change the non-deontic basis to get\neither a system that is similar to Anderson\u2019s system or a system that\nis identical with intuitionistic or constructive propositional logic\nwith double negation as an obligation-like operator, or apply two\npatches to the deontic postulates to obtain a system similar to\nstandard deontic logic.\n\nSome authors have refused to view Mally\u2019s deontic logic as a\n\u201creal\u201d deontic system and say that they \u201cmention it\nonly by way of curiosity\u201d (Meyer and Wieringa 1993, p.\u00a04).\nThe above shows that this judgment is too harsh. It is only a small\nstep, not a giant leap, from Mally\u2019s system to modern systems of\ndeontic logic, so Mally\u2019s pioneering effort deserves rehabilitation\nrather than contempt.\n",
