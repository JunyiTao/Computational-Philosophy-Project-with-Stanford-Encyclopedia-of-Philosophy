    "main_text": "Life and Main Works\n1. Life and Main Works\n\nJohn Norris was born on January 2, 1657 in Collingbourne Kingston,\nWiltshire. His father was a minister, and Norris was the second of\nfour siblings. His early training was a Puritan one. In 1671, he began\na course of study at Winchester School, where he received a classical\neducation; the curriculum included Greek and Latin literature, and the\nyoung Norris excelled at his studies. He matriculated at Exeter\nCollege, at Oxford, spending the years from 1676 \u2013 1680 studying\nthe Scholastic and ancient authors. In 1680, Norris was elected a\nFellow of All Souls College, a distinction he enjoyed for nine years\nand would always recall fondly. He was ordained in 1684 and sometime\nbefore 1688 he also discovered the works of Malebranche, who would\nbecome one of his philosophical heroes.\n\nIt was during his stay at All Souls that Norris published several of\nhis most popular works. He published the first edition of A\nCollection of Miscellanies in 1687, which would culminate in a\nninth edition printed in 1730. At this time he also published\n\u201cThe Root of Liberty,\u201d a sermon in which he defended human\nfreedom by an appeal to the Augustinian concept of attention. In these\npublications, Norris\u2019 own thought is pronounced; they exhibit an\nindependence from the heavy influence Malebranchean doctrine would\nexert upon Norris\u2019 subsequent works. The Theory and Regulation of\nLove, a piece characterizing love as the summons of God, was\npublished in 1688, and the first text in which Norris clearly adopted\nMalebranchean arguments. Norris appended to this text his\ncorrespondence with Henry More, the Cambridge Platonist. Finally in\n1689, he published Reason and Religion, which would be\nreissued seven times until 1724.\n\nHe resigned the fellowship in 1689, married, and began a two-year\noccupation as rector at Newton St. Loe in Somersetshire. There, he\npublished one of his most popular texts, Christian\nBlessedness, in 1690. One year later, Locke appealed to the Earl\nof Pembroke on Norris\u2019 behalf; consequently, Norris assumed the duties\nof rector at Bemerton near Salisbury. In general, he preferred study\nand meditation, and found his duties as rector to impinge upon his\nscholarly activities. Nonetheless, he maintained various\ncorrespondences. He engaged in correspondences with Elizabeth Thomas\n(\u201cCorinna\u201d), Damaris Cudworth (Lady Masham), Mary Astell\nand Locke, among others. In 1695, Norris published his correspondence\nwith Astell and entitled it, Letters concerning the Love of God,\nbetween the Author of the Proposal to the Ladies and Mr. John\nNorris. Moreover, he found the time to publish pamphlets and\ntreatises on a variety of topics including the Toleration Act,\nChristian morality, the immortality of the soul, and the difference\nbetween the Ideal Philosophy he endorsed and the enthusiasm of the\nQuakers. Norris made clear these differences in an addendum to\nReflections upon the Conduct of Human Life in 1691. Richard\nVickris, the Quaker, replied irately to this addendum. This generated\na heated reply from Norris, in which he further elucidated the\ndifferences between the \u201cdivine light\u201d of his own\nphilosophy and that of the Quaker doctrines. This work was entitled\nTwo Treatises concerning the Divine Light and was issued in\n1692. Locke and Norris shared the objective of debunking the Quakers\u2019\nclaim to direct enlightenment from God. But their differences far\noutweighed their similarities.\n\nIn 1690, Norris issued criticisms of Locke\u2019s An Essay concerning\nHuman Understanding\u00b8 the first edition of which was\npublished in December 1689. Norris\u2019 review, entitled Cursory\nReflections upon a Book called An Essay concerning Human\nUnderstanding, prompted Locke to modify the second edition of the\nEssay at 2.10.2. Otherwise, Locke did not reply publicly to\nNorris\u2019 criticisms. It was only after Locke and Norris quarreled that\nLocke published his estimation of Norris\u2019 works. Lady Masham had\nentrusted a letter for Locke to Norris, but news reached Locke that\nNorris had opened the letter. Locke suspected Norris in spite of his\nprotests, and from that time forward, which was the end of 1692, they\nwere not on friendly terms (Cranston 1957, 364\u2013365). Shortly\nthereafter (1693), Locke wrote Remarks upon some of Mr. Norris\u2019\nBooks, Wherein he asserts P. Malebranche\u2019s Opinion of seeing all\nThings in God and Examination of Malebranche. Charlotte\nJohnston has argued that the impetus and target for Locke\u2019s critical\nevaluation of Malebranche\u2019s thought was Norris, whom he viewed as\nreiterating Malebranche\u2019s thought (1958). In the Cursory\nReflections, Norris stated that he would soon publish a treatise,\nin which he would present his own philosophy at length.\n\nBut it was not until 1701 that Norris completed the first volume of\nhis magnum opus, An Essay Towards the Theory of the Ideal or\nIntelligible World. The second volume was issued in 1704.\n(Hereafter, Theory I and Theory II, respectively.)\nNorris examines the divine nature in Theory I and in\nTheory II he details the nature of creation, specifically the\nnature of humanity and animals. These highly theoretical works did not\nenjoy the popular success of his other writings. One of these, An\nAccount of Reason and Faith, in Relation to the Mysteries of\nChristianity, was so well-read that it was issued in a fourteenth\nedition as late as 1790. His last two theoretical works concerned the\nnature of the soul: A Philosophical Discourse concerning the\nNatural Immortality of the Soul, published in 1708, and A\nLetter to Mr. Dodwell concerning the Immortality of the Soul of\nMan, issued in 1709. It would seem that his many duties as rector\ndid not hinder him completely from engaging in his beloved\nintellectual pursuits, as his publication record demonstrates. His\nfinal publication within his own lifetime, A Treatise concerning\nChristian Prudence, was printed just a year before his death. He\ndied in February of 1711, aged fifty-six years, at Bemerton, and was\ninterred there.\n\nIt is puzzling that a figure as popular and widely-read as Norris has\nreceived such little recognition from intellectual historians of the\nearly modern period. Perhaps Norris has not been paid much attention\nbecause his philosophical writings appear to contain an eclectic\nmixture of many divergent, incompatible sources rather than a coherent\nsynthesis of those sources. Charles McCracken notes that Norris has\nbeen dubbed in a variety of ways, but that the \u201cEnglish\nMalebranche\u201d seems most appropriate (179). Norris was heavily\ninfluenced by Malebranche, and goes so far as advising his own\nchildren that Malebranche\u2019s Search after Truth should\n\u201calways be read, studied, dwelt and fed upon till it be\ndigested, made your own, and converted as it were into the very\nSubstance of your Souls\u201d (Spiritual Counsel 501).\nNorris was also a follower of Descartes, whom Norris viewed as\nconstructing \u201cthe only intelligible Frame of Natural Science\nthat has yet appear\u2019d in the World, and the only intire System that\ndeserves the name of Philosophy\u201d (500). Norris also\ndraws liberally from his Scholastic background, and frequently uses\ntheoretical tools borrowed from the canonical thinkers taught at the\nuniversities, such as Aquinas, Augustine and Suarez. His heavy\nreliance on diverse intellectual sources, especially Descartes and\nMalebranche, is apparent in his writings. Nonetheless, his arguments\nare tremendously valuable for understanding better the debates of his\ntime. His rehearsal of Descartes\u2019 real distinction proof and his\nevaluation of Locke\u2019s thinking matter hypothesis exposes some critical\nLockean assumptions, bringing into sharp relief the disagreements\nbetween the rationalists and empiricists of that era. He also\ninfluenced the views of other minor figures, most notably, Mary Astell\nand Arthur Collier. Finally, Norris\u2019 adaptation and expansion of\nMalebranche\u2019s twin doctrines of Vision in God and occasionalism are\nalso central to understanding the continuation of the Cartesian\nproject in late 17th and early 18th century\nEngland.\n",
