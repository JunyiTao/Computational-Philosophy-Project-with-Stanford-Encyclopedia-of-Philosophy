    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe Austrian philosopher Ernst Mally (1879\u20131944) is one of the\nmost important representatives of Meinong\u2019s School. Though he is best\nknown for his work on Meinong\u2019s theory of objects (Gegenstandstheorie)\nand for his development of deontic logic, he has also gained some\nnotoriety for his German-nationalist convictions and his support of\nNational Socialist ideology. On the one hand, Mally\u2019s contribution to\nMeinong\u2019s theory of objects is not a mere extension of his teacher\u2019s\nwork, but rather a real alternative that, in turn, influenced Meinong\u2019s\nown conceptions. Moreover, he was the first philosopher to establish a\nformal system of deontic logic (see the entry on\n Mally\u2019s deontic logic),\n and though, according to most philosophers, it was\nseriously flawed, it was a major undertaking and only recently received\nthe attention it was due. On the other hand, some of Mally\u2019s later\nwritings were particularly influenced by his sympathies for National\nSocialism. In what follows, we will identify and outline the various\nstrands of his thought, and also address the delicate question of\nwhether and how his sympathies for National Socialism affected his\nlater philosophical work.\n",
