    "main_text": "The Syncategoreumata\n4. The Syncategoreumata\n\nPeter\u2019s treatise on syncategorematic words forms part of a\nseparate genre that developed from the beginning of the thirteenth\ncentury. The term syncategorema comes from a famous passage\nin Priscian\u2019s Institutiones grammatice II, 15, which\nintroduces two types of wordclasses (partes orationis)\ndistinguished by logicians, viz. nouns and verbs on the one hand, and\nsyncategoremata, or consignificantia, on the other.\nThe latter are defined as words that do not have a definitive meaning\non their own, but acquire one only in combination with other,\ncategorematic words.\n\nLike the treatises of the Tractatus kind, the\nSyncategoreumata were developed from the (twelfth-century)\ntheories on fallacies, as well as from grammatical doctrines (from the\nsame period). From the second half of the twelfth century, there was a\ngrowing interest in the linguistic elements that are considered to lie\nat the basis of ambiguity and fallacious reasoning. Hence the increase\nof treatises presenting a systematic account of these terms. The\nconnection between these treatises and Priscian\u2019s grammar can be\ngathered from the attention different authors pay to the signa\nquantitatis (or quantifiers) and their interest in the meaning\nand function of syncategorematic terms.\n\nThe list of words to be included among the syncategoreumata\nwas not always the same. Generally speaking it comprised exclusive\nwords tantum (only), solus (alone), exceptive words\nsuch as preter (except), nisi (unless), consecutive\nwords such as si (if) and nisi (if not), the words\nincipit (begins) and desinit (ceases), the modal\nterms necessario (necessarily) and contingenter\n(contingently), the conjunctives an (or), et (and),\nnisi (unless), in eo quod (in that), and\nquin (that not). In Peter\u2019s work we also find a\ndiscussion of the terms quanto (\u2018how much\u2019 or\n\u2018as much as\u2019) quam (\u2018than\u2019 or\n\u2018as\u2019) and quicquid (whatever). Unlike that of\nsome other authors (such as William of Sherwood and Robert Bacon), his\nlist does not include the word omnis.\n\nIn the opening of his Syncategoreumata, Peter presents his\nrationale for this investigation, viz. that there is a close link\nbetween the use of these kinds of words in sentences and their\ntruth-value. His idea is that the syncategoreumata must have\nsome sort of signification, but not the same as the categorematic\nwords. For this special kind of signification he uses the words\nconsignificatio and dispositio.\n\nThe first two separate chapters of the Syncategoreumata are\ndevoted to the words est and non respectively, which\nare said to be implied in all other syncategorematic words.\nPeter\u2019s account of the first word focuses on the notion of\ncompositio (composition), which is explained in great detail,\nby looking into the signification of nouns and verbs (signifying a\ncomposition of a quality with a substance, and that of an act with a\nsubstance respectively). Considerable attention is given to the\ncomposition featuring in the verb \u2018is\u2019, in the form of the\nquestion of whether the composition involved can be counted among\nbeings or not, considering the fact that it can be used to express\ndifferent kinds of states of affairs. The chapter on negation\nintroduces the important distinction between an act as conceived of or\nin the manner of a concept (ut concepta sive per modum\nconceptus) and an act as carried out (ut exercita) (see\nNuchelmans 1988). Among the former type we acts as expressed by the\nnoun \u2018negation\u2019 and the verb \u2018to deny, whereas an\nact of the latter type is what is expressed by the negative particle\n\u2018not\u2019. The remainder of this chapter deals with the\nfunction of the negation, which is to remove the composition found in\nwhatever it covers, and discusses some well-known sophisma-sentences\nwhich turn on the specific function of negation.\n\nThe third chapter of the Syncategoreumata discusses the\nexclusive words solus and tantum. They are called\nexclusives because they carry out an exclusion, not because they\nsignify one. An exclusion, furthermore, requires four things, namely,\nwhat is excluded, what is excluded from, the respect in which it is\nexcluded, and the act of exclusion. The kinds of exclusion are divided\ninto general and specific: the former involves an exclusion from\nsomething generic, whereas the latter from something specific.\nQuestions that come up in this section have to do with the results of\nadding an exclusive term to different kinds of words, such as to a\nterm falling under the category of Substance: does it exclude only\nother substances, or does it also exclude from things listed under\nanother category? And what if it is added to a term listed under the\ncategory of Accident (such as colour, quantity, and so on)? The next\nquestion deals with the sorts of terms that can be meaningfully\nassociated with an exclusion. For example, is it possible to exclude\nsomething from \u2018being\u2019 (as in \u2018Only being is,\ntherefore nothing other than being is\u2019)? The tract proceeds with\nthe kinds of things that can qualify for an exclusion. The fourth\nchapter, which deals with exceptive words, is compiled in a similar\nmanner.\n\nThe fifth chapter is about the word si, which is said to\nsignify causality in or via antecedence. The chapter also discusses\nthe kinds of consecution or consequence, problems of inference\nconnected with the referents of terms used in consecutive sentences,\nand how to contradict a conditional sentence. Special attention is\ngiven to the problem whether from an impossible antecedent anything\nfollows.\n\nThe chapter on \u2018begins\u2019 and \u2018ceases\u2019 is a good\nexample of the way in which extra-logical considerations found their\nway into medieval treatises on logic. Thus, apart from the semantics\nand inferential problems connected with the use of these words in\npropositions, the chapter also looks into the notions of motion and\ntime. An important part of Peter\u2019s ontological views can be\ngathered from chapter seven, which covers issues connected with the\nuse of modal terms. Chapter eight discusses the signification and use\nof connectives, and the final chapter on syncategorematic words proper\nis concerned with the expressions quanto, quam and\nquicquid. A very short, concluding chapter of Peter\u2019s\nSyncategoreumata deals with a somewhat isolated topic, i.e.,\nthe proper modes of response in an argument. The topics looked into\nare solution, the quantity and quality of syllogisms, and the ways to\ngo about proving a syllogism.\n",
