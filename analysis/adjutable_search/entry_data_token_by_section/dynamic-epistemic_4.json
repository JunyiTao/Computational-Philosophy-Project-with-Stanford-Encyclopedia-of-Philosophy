    "main_text": "Complex epistemic interactions\n3. Complex epistemic interactions\n\nIn the previous section, we focused on one kind of model-transforming\naction: the public announcement. In this section, we look at the\npopular \u201caction model\u201d generalization of public\nannouncements due to Baltag, Moss, and Solecki (Baltag, Moss, and\nSolecki 1998), together referred to as \u201cBMS\u201d. Action\nmodels are simple relational structures that can be used to describe a\nvariety of informational actions, from public announcements to more\nsubtle communications that may contain degrees of privacy,\nmisdirection, deception, and suspicion, to name just a few\npossibilities. \n",
