    "main_text": "New approaches to ability || Other approaches\n5.3 Other approaches\n\nStill other approaches to ability reject (CA) and (MA) while rejecting\nalso the thought that some appeal to power \u2014 be it a\ndisposition, a potentiality, or a two-way power \u2014 is needed to\naccount for abilities.\n\nOne recurrent thought is that, despite the various challenges that\nhave been brought against it, ability is still intimately connected to\nsome kind of relation between an agent\u2019s volitions (tryings,\nintendings) and her actions. One semantically sophisticated\ndevelopment of this thought is Mandelkern et al, 2017, which proposes\nto take as basic a notion of \u2018practically available\nactions,\u2019 and to develop in terms of these a semantics for\nagentive modality, one on which conditionals linking volitions to\nactions continue to play an essential role. Another approach, in a\nrecent book-length treatment of ability (Jaster 2020), proposes that\nabilities should be thought of in terms of proportions of cases where\nan agent successfully does what she intends to do (compare the\napproach to dispositions advocated in Manley and Wasserman 2008). Both\nof these approaches are explicit in their denial of (CA), but they\nshare \u2014 with the new dispositionalists \u2014 the thought that\nthe analysis of ability should somehow appeal to a pattern of\ndependence between volition and action.\n\nThis is not surprising. The conditional analysis is a redoubtable\nproposal, endorsed by many of the major figures in English-language\nphilosophy. In light of that, it seems reasonable to try to discard\nthe letter of (CA), but retain its spirit. For it may be that the\nhistorical failure of (CA) is due to difficulties and oversights that\nour perhaps firmer grasp of technical issues allows us to overcome.\nThis is a sensible and well-motivated project, though it remains to be\nseen whether it will be, in the end, a successful one.\n\nThere remain still other accounts that do not fit easily into the\ntaxonomy provided here. These include primitivist proposals, which\ntake ability or some closely related notion as analytically\nfundamental. One development of this idea is Maier 2015, who proposes,\ncontrary to most authors, that specific ability is fundamentally prior\nto general ability. He argues that we should give an account of\ngeneral ability in terms of specific abilities, which he calls\n\u2018options\u2019: roughly, an agent has the general ability to A\niff she normally has A as an option. Options, in turn, are primitives.\nMuch here will hang on saying more about options, and in what sense\nthey figure as primitives in the theory of agency.\n\nFinally, an outline of a proposal by David Lewis (dated to 2001 but\nonly recently published as Lewis 2020) offers an altogether different\napproach to ability. Lewis is motivated, like many proponents of (CA),\nby the goal of defending compatibilism, but he takes (CA) to be\nunsatisfactory. He therefore proposes a non-conditional analysis of\nability. His analysis, roughly, is that S has the ability to\nperform an action B just in case there is some basic\naction A such that (i) S\u2019s doing A\nwould cause or constitute S\u2019s doing B and (ii)\nthere is no obstacle to S\u2019s doing A. The\nproblem of giving a theory of ability then becomes the problem of\ngiving a theory of obstacles, something at which Lewis, in his\noutline, makes a beginning. (See\u00a0Beebee et al 2020\u00a0for\nadditional discussion).\n\nLewis\u2019s proposal is an inspiration for further research in at\nleast two ways. First, it indicates that Lewis, a systematic philosopher of modality, saw the\nproblem of giving an analysis of ability as a significant outstanding\nproject. Second, it demonstrates that genuinely novel approaches to\nability remain available, and the project of giving a theory of\nability may yet be in its early stages.\n",
