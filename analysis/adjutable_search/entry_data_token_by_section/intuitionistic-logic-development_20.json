    "main_text": "The Proof Interpretation Made Explicit || Kolmogorov 1932 and Heyting 1934\n5.3 Kolmogorov 1932 and Heyting 1934\n\nIn 1932, Kolmogorov presented a logic of problems and their solutions,\nand pointed out that the logic this explanation validates is formally\nequivalent to the intuitionistic propositional and predicate logic\npresented by Heyting in 1930. Moreover, he suggests that this provides\na better interpretation than Heyting\u2019s.\n\nKolmogorov\u2019s idea is this:\n\n\nIf \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are two problems,\nthen \\(a \\wedge b\\) designates the problem \u201cto solve both\nproblems \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\u201d, while\n\\(a \\vee b\\) designates the problem \u201cto solve at least one of\nthe problems \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\u201d.\nFurthermore, \\(a \\supset b\\) is the problem \u201cto solve \\(b\\)\nprovided that the solution for \\(a\\)\nis given\u201d or, equivalently, \u201cto reduce the solution of \\(b\\)\nto the solution of \\(a\\)\u201d\n\\(\\ldots \\neg a\\) designates the problem \u201cto obtain a\ncontradiction provided that the solution of \\(a\\) is\ngiven\u201d \\(\\ldots(x)a(x)\\) stands in general for the problem\n\u201cto give a general method for the solution of \\(a(x)\\) for every\nsingle value of \\(x\\)\u201d. (Kolmogorov 1932: 59\n[Mancosu 1998: 329])\n\n\nHe then lists Heyting\u2019s axioms for propositional logic (with\nHeyting\u2019s numbering) and, by discussing an example, makes it\nclear that these all hold when interpreted as statements about\nproblems and their solutions. He also points out that \\(a \\vee \\neg\na\\) is the problem\n\n\nto give a general method that allows, for every problem \\(a\\),\neither to find a solution for \\(a\\),\nor to infer a contradiction from the existence of a solution for \\(a\\)!\n\nIn particular, if the problem \\(a\\) consists in the\nproof of a proposition, then one must possess a general method either\nto prove or to reduce to a contradiction any proposition. (Kolmogorov\n1932: 63 [Mancosu 1998: 332]).\n\n\nIn the second part of his paper, Kolmogorov argues that, given the\nepistemological tenets of intuitionism,\n\n\nintuitionistic logic should be replaced by the calculus of problems,\nfor its objects are in reality not theoretical propositions but rather\nproblems. (Kolmogorov 1932: 58 [Mancosu 1998: 328])\n\n\nThat he considers his interpretation an alternative to\nHeyting\u2019s, and a preferable one, is again emphasized in a note\nadded in proof:\n\n\nThis interpretation of intuitionistic logic is closely connected with\nthe ideas Mr. Heyting has developed in the last volume of\nErkenntnis 2, 1931: 106 [Heyting 1931]; yet in Heyting a\nclear distinction between propositions and problems is missing.\n(Kolmogorov 1932: 65 [Mancosu 1998: 334])\n\n\nBut it is not at all clear that Heyting would want to make that\ndistinction. If the notion of proposition is understood in such a way\nthat a proposition is true or false independently of our knowledge of\nthis fact, then Heyting would readily agree with Kolmogorov that a\nproposition is different from a problem; but as soon as one adopts the\nview that propositions express intentions that are fulfilled (and the\nproposition made true) or disappointed (and the proposition made\nfalse) by our mathematical constructions, which is the view that\nHeyting actually held, then there would seem to be no essential\ndifference between propositions and problems. Kolmogorov himself had\nalready indicated that a problem may consist in finding the proof of a\nproposition; exploiting this, one can argue that the following two\nnotions of proposition coincide:\n\npropositions express intentions towards constructions\npropositions pose problems which are solved by carrying out\nconstructions\n\n\nThe basic idea is that a proposition in sense 1 gives rise to the\nproblem of finding a construction that fulfills the expressed\nintention, and that a solution to a problem posed in a proposition in\nsense 2 also serves to fulfill the intention towards constructions\nthat solve that problem; this is made fully explicit in a little\nargument due to Martin-L\u00f6f, given in detail in Sundholm 1983:\n158\u2013159.\n\nIn a letter to Heyting of October 12, 1931, Kolmogorov in effect\nagrees that the difference between Heyting and him is mainly a\nterminological matter (Troelstra 1990: 15).\n\nHeyting later claimed that Kolmogorov\u2019s meaning explanation and\nhis own amounted to the same (Heyting 1958C: 107). By 1937, Kolmogorov\nseems to have come to believe the same, as in a review in the\nZentralblatt of an exchange between Freudenthal and Heyting\n(discussed in Section 1 of the supplementary document\n Objections to the Proof Interpretation), he consistently speaks of \u201cintention or problem\u201d\n(Kolmogorov 1937). In that exchange itself, Freudenthal (1937: 114)\nhad said that between Heyting\u2019s and Kolmogorov\u2019s\nexplanations there was \u201cno essential difference\u201d. Finally,\nOskar Becker, in a letter to Heyting of September 1934, had remarked\nthat Heyting\u2019s interpretation is a generalization of\nKolmogorov\u2019s, as a \u201cproblem\u201d and its\n\u201csolution\u201d are special cases of an intention and its\nfulfillment. \u201cIntuitionistic logic is therefore a\n\u2018calculus of\n intentions\u2019\u201d.[30]\n\nHowever, a complication for the identification of Heyting\u2019s and\nKolmogorov\u2019s explanations of logic is introduced by\nKolmogorov\u2019s also accepting, in a particular case, solutions\nthat do not consist in a carrying out a concrete construction.\nKolmogorov said that \u201cAs soon as \\(\\neg a\\) is solved, then the\nsolution of \\(a\\) is impossible and the problem \\(a\n\\rightarrow b\\) is without content\u201d (Kolmogorov 1932: 62\n[Mancosu 1998: 331]), and proposed that \u201cThe proof that a\nproblem is without content [owing to an impossible assumption] will\nalways be considered as its solution\u201d (Kolmogorov 1932: 59:\n[Mancosu 1998: 329]). Taken together, this yields a justification of\nEx Falso, \\(\\neg a \\rightarrow(a \\rightarrow b)\\).\n\nIt seems not altogether unreasonable to extend the meaning of the term\n\u201csolution\u201d this way, for, just like a concrete solution,\nan impossibility proof also provides what might be called\n\u201cepistemic closure\u201d: like a concrete solution, it provides\na completely convincing reason to stop working on a certain problem.\n(This kind of \u201chigher-order\u201d solution is also familiar\nfrom Hilbert\u2019s Program, e.g., Hilbert 1900: 51.) Note that this\njustification of Ex Falso makes no attempt to describe a\ncounterfactual mathematical construction process; thus,\nKolmogorov\u2019s justification in 1932 is not really incompatible\nwith the ground for his rejection of Ex Falso in 1925,\nnamely, that one cannot constructively assert consequences of\nsomething impossible. Rather, the solution from 1932 introduces a\nstipulation to achieve completion of the logical theory for its own\nsake.\n\nOn the other hand, although Kolmogorov\u2019s stipulation is neither\nunreasonable nor unmotivated, on Brouwer\u2019s descriptive\nconception of logic there is of course no place for stipulation. For\nthis reason, \u201cProof Interpretation\u201d seems to be a more\nappropriate name for an explanation of Brouwerian logic than\n\u201cBHK Interpretation\u201d.\n\nOn Heyting\u2019s explanation, however, a justification of Ex\nFalso parallel to Kolmogorov\u2019s would seem to be impossible:\nwhile a problem may find a \u201chigher-order\u201d solution when it\nis shown that a solution is impossible, it makes no sense to say that\nan intention finds \u201chigher-order\u201d fulfillment when it is\nshown that it cannot be fulfilled. The notion of a solution seems to\npermit a reasonable extension that the notion of fulfillment does not.\nIn his book from 1934, Heyting explains Ex Falso in\nKolmogorov\u2019s terms, not his own. After stating the axiom \\(\\neg\na \\supset (a \\supset b)\\), he says:\n\n\nIt is appropriate to interpret the notion of \u201creducing\u201d in\nsuch a way, that the proof of the impossibility of solving \\(a\\)\nat the same time reduces the solution of any problem\nwhatsoever to that of \\(a\\). (Heyting 1934: 15;\ntranslation mine)\n\n\nClearly there is a difference between Kolmogorov\u2019s own\nexplanation and Heyting\u2019s explanation in Kolmogorov\u2019s\nterms. Where Heyting says that a proof of \\(\\neg a\\) establishes a\nreduction of the solution of any problem to that of \\(a\\),\nKolmogorov had said that it established that the\nproblem of reducing the solution of any problem to that of \\(a\\)\nhas become without content. One has the impression\nthat Heyting in his explanation of Ex Falso tries to\napproximate as closely as possible the explanation for ordinary\nimplications in terms of a concrete constructive connection between\nantecedent and consequent; this is even clearer in the explanation he\nwould give of Ex Falso in 1956 (see\n section 5.4\n below). (Note that neither Heyting nor Kolmogorov ever justified\nEx Falso by giving the traditional argument (based on the\ndisjunctive syllogism) also stated in Glivenko\u2019s paper from\n1929; see\n section 4.3\n above.)\n\nMore generally, the explanation of logic in Heyting 1934 is for the\nmost part given Kolmogorov style, and not Heyting\u2019s own in terms\nof intentions and their fulfillment. (The latter is only mentioned for\nits explanation of the implication (Heyting 1934: 14).) Perhaps the\nreason for this is that Heyting (1934: 14) agrees with Kolmogorov\n(1932: 58) that the interpretation in terms of problems and solutions\nprovides a useful interpretation Heyting\u2019s formal system also\nfor non-intuitionists (while for intuitionists they come to the same\nthing). In his short note 1932C, titled \u201cThe application of\nintuitionistic logic to the definition of completeness of a logical\ncalculus\u201d, Heyting uses Kolmogorov\u2019s interpretation\ninstead of his own. Given the subject matter, that is what one might\nexpect.\n",
