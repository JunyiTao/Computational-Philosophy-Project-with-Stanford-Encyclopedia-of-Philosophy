    "main_text": "Classical Theories of the Doctrine of Atonement || Moral Influence\n4.5 Moral Influence\n\nMoral influence views say that Christ atones for human sin by\ninfluencing humans to live a morally good life. In effect, these views\nemphasize the moral transformation aspect of atonement. This view is\noften attributed to the twelfth century theologian\n Abelard.[45]\n Contemporary scholarship has tended to see Abelard\u2019s view as\nmore sophisticated (Quinn 1993; Weingart 1970), although some still\nargue that Abelard is best understood as embracing a moral influence\ntheory (Pugh 2014). Many theologians of the German\nAufkl\u00e4rung endorsed moral influence views (McGrath\n1985), as did Socinus (1668), Kant (1793 [1998]), Rashdall (1920) and,\nmore recently, Hick (1993 [2005]).\n\nMoral influence views differ regarding the mechanism by which humans\nare influenced to live morally. The moral exemplar view says that\nChrist is an example of a morally excellent life. The mechanism of\ninfluence is inspiration\u2014Christ\u2019s example inspires us to\ngreater moral heights. This view has been repeatedly criticized for\n(i) downplaying the fact that humans have sinned and thus need to be\nreconciled to God, not just inspired to live better (McGrath 1985),\nand (ii) offering too thin a mechanism (Crisp 2020b). To be a model\nfor inspiration does not make us righteous and does not overcome the\nforces preventing us from being righteous. To put it another way, on\nthe moral exemplar view Christ does not atone for humans, but at most\nhe motivates humans to atone.\n\nMore sophisticated moral influence views work around the above\nobjections. They can say that Christ\u2019s death shows the depth of\nhuman depravity, inspiring humans not just to want to be better\npeople, but also to see more clearly their own sins and to repent for\nthose sins. Furthermore, the Holy Spirit\u2014the third person of the\nTrinity\u2014works to bring about transformation within a person who\nis open to receiving it (Moberly 1924). The Holy Spirit can transform\npeople and undo obstacles to transformation that would be difficult or\nimpossible to manage without God\u2019s help.\n\nHowever, even these more sophisticated views face a host of\nobjections:\n\nthey do not adequately account for the Biblical ideas that\nChrist\u2019s atoning work is substitutionary, representative, and\nexpiatory (Crisp 2020b),\nthey cannot explain why Christ\u2019s death is crucial for\natonement (Pugh 2014: 132), and\nthey cannot account for the Biblical language of sacrifice.\n\n",
