    "main_text": "The Frame Problem in Logic\n2. The Frame Problem in Logic\n\n\nPut succinctly, the frame problem in its narrow, technical form is\nthis (McCarthy & Hayes 1969). Using mathematical logic, how is it\npossible to write formulae that describe the effects of actions without\nhaving to write a large number of accompanying formulae that describe\nthe mundane, obvious non-effects of those actions? Let's take a look at\nan example. The difficulty can be illustrated without the full\napparatus of formal logic, but it should be borne in mind that the\ndevil is in the mathematical details. Suppose we write two formulae,\none describing the effects of painting an object and the other\ndescribing the effects of moving an object.\n\nColour(x, c) holds after\nPaint(x, c)\nPosition(x, p) holds after\nMove(x, p)\n\n\n\nNow, suppose we have an initial situation in which\nColour(A, Red)\nand Position(A, House) hold. According to\nthe machinery of deductive logic, what then holds after the action\nPaint(A, Blue) followed by the\naction Move(A, Garden)?  Intuitively, we\nwould expect Colour(A, Blue) and\nPosition(A, Garden) to hold. Unfortunately,\nthis is not the case. If written out more formally in classical\npredicate logic, using a suitable formalism for representing time and\naction such as the situation calculus (McCarthy & Hayes 1969), the\ntwo formulae above only license the conclusion\nthat Position(A, Garden) holds.  This is\nbecause they don't rule out the possibility that the colour of\nA gets changed by the Move action.\n\n\nThe most obvious way to augment such a formalisation so that the\nright common sense conclusions fall out is to add a number of formulae\nthat explicitly describe the non-effects of each action. These formulae\nare called frame axioms. For the example at hand, we need a\npair of frame axioms.\n\nColour(x, c) holds after Move(x, p) if Colour(x, c) held\nbeforehand\nPosition(x, p) holds after Paint(x, c) if Position(x, p) held\nbeforehand\n\n\n\nIn other words, painting an object will not affect its position, and\nmoving an object will not affect its colour. With the addition of these\ntwo formulae (written more formally in predicate logic), all the\ndesired conclusions can be drawn. However, this is not at all a\nsatisfactory solution. Since most actions do not affect\nmost properties of a situation, in a domain comprising\nM actions and N properties we will, in general, have\nto write out almost MN frame axioms. Whether these formulae\nare destined to be stored explicitly in a computer's memory, or are\nmerely part of the designer's specification, this is an unwelcome\nburden.\n\n\nThe challenge, then, is to find a way to capture the non-effects of\nactions more succinctly in formal logic. What we need, it seems, is\nsome way of declaring the general rule-of-thumb that an action can be\nassumed not to change a given property of a situation unless\nthere is evidence to the contrary. This default assumption is known as\nthe common sense law of inertia. The (technical) frame problem\ncan be viewed as the task of formalising this law.\n\n\nThe main obstacle to doing this is the monotonicity of\nclassical logic. In classical logic, the set of conclusions that can be\ndrawn from a set of formulae always increases with the\naddition of further formulae. This makes it impossible to express a\nrule that has an open-ended set of exceptions, and the common sense law\nof inertia is just such a rule. For example, in due course we might\nwant to add a formula that captures the exception to Axiom 3 that\narises when we move an object into a pot of paint. But our not having\nthought of this exception before should not prevent us from applying\nthe common sense law of inertia and drawing a wide enough set of\n(defeasible) conclusions to get off the ground.\n\n\nAccordingly, researchers in logic-based AI have put a lot of effort\ninto developing a variety of non-monotonic reasoning\nformalisms, such as circumscription (McCarthy 1986), and\ninvestigating their application to the frame problem. None of this has\nturned out to be at all straightforward. One of the most troublesome\nbarriers to progress was highlighted in the so-called Yale shooting\nproblem (Hanks & McDermott 1987), a simple scenario that gives\nrise to counter-intuitive conclusions if naively represented with a\nnon-monotonic formalism. To make matters worse, a full solution needs\nto work in the presence of concurrent actions, actions with\nnon-deterministic effects, continuous change, and actions with indirect\nramifications. In spite of these subtleties, a number of solutions to\nthe technical frame problem now exist that are adequate for logic-based\nAI research. Although improvements and extensions continue to be found,\nit is fair to say that the dust has settled, and that the frame\nproblem, in its technical guise, is more-or-less solved (Shanahan\n1997; Lifschitz 2015).\n",
