    "main_text": "Life and works\n1. Life and works\n\nSources for Catharine Macaulay\u2019s early life are scarce, and modern\nhistorians have relied on the account published by Mary Hays in her\nFemale Biography (Hays 1803, 5.287\u2013307; Hill 1992,\n1\u201324). Hays represents Macaulay\u2019s childhood as a romance of\nmiraculous self-education. She was born Catharine Sawbridge on April\n2, 1731 (March 23, 1730, old style) the second child of John Sawbridge\nand Dorothy Wanley, at Olantigh in Kent, a property that had been a\ngift from her grandfather, who had made a fortune, and then lost much\nof it as well as his reputation, as a result of his position as one of\nthe directors of the South Sea Company. Having given birth to two\ndaughters and two sons, John and Wanley, Catharine\u2019s mother died\nleaving her and her siblings to the care of their father, who was often absent, while their uncle Jacob, who was married to Anne Brodnax from the neighboring Godmersham, remained at Olantigh. Though Macaulays cousins by this marriage appear to have had a greater claim, Godmersham was later inherited by Jane Austen\u2019s brother, Edward (Green 2017). According to Hays, Macaulay was educated by \u201can\nantiquated, well-recommended, but ignorant governess,\u201d who could\nnot satisfy her intellectual curiosity, and \u201chaving\nfound her way into her father\u2019s well-furnished library, she became her\nown purveyor, and rioted in intellectual luxury\u201d (Hays 1803,\n5.288\u20139). It is here, according to Hays, that she first became\ninterested in the history of the Greeks and Romans, \u201ctheir laws\nand manners interested her understanding, the spirit of patriotism\nseized her, and she became an enthusiast in the cause of\nfreedom.\u201d (Hays 1803, 5.289\u201390) While perhaps exaggerated,\nthis rather romantic account can be accepted as in essence accurate,\nsince Hay\u2019s informant, \u201cMrs Arnold of Leicester\u201d was the\nsister of Macaulay\u2019s second husband. It echoes Macaulay\u2019s own\nassertion, in the introduction to the first volume of her History\nof England that,\n\n\nFrom my early youth I have read with delight those histories which\nexhibit Liberty in its most exalted state, the annals of the Roman and\nthe Greek republics. Studies like these excite that natural love of\nFreedom which lies latent in the breast of every rational being.\n(Macaulay 1763\u201383, 1.7)\n\n\nAt the age of twenty-six, she spent an afternoon conversing with\nElizabeth Carter, who was then soliciting subscriptions for her\ntranslation of Epictetus, and subscribed to her translation. This\nfriend and correspondent of the Bluestocking, Elizabeth Montagu,\ninitially represented Macaulay quite favourably as \u201cmore deeply\nlearned than becomes a fine lady\u201d who \u201cbetween the Spartan\nlaws, the Roman politics, the philosophy of Epicurus, and the wit of\nSt Evremond\u201d had formed \u201ca most extraordinary\nsystem.\u201d (Carter 1808, 2. 260; Hill 1992, 11)\n\n\nAlthough Macaulay has been associated with the Bluestockings, and\nalong with Montagu and Carter, was included in Richard Samuel\u2019s,\n1779, painting, \u201cThe Nine Living Muses of Great Britain\u201d,\nshe was too radical for their taste (Guest 2002; Eger and Peltz 2008;\nO\u2019Brien 2009). This, despite the fact that Montagu and her\nsister, Sarah Scott, were acquainted with the Sawbridges, who were\nneighbours in Kent. On hearing of the publication of the first volume\nof Macaulay\u2019s history, Montagu commented dismissively, \u201cIf\nshe took her sentiments from her Father, & her language from Mrs\nFuzzard it must be an extraordinary performance\u201d (Elizabeth\nMontagu to Matthew Robinson-Morris, 2nd Baron Rokeby, 4 December 1763,\nNewcastle. Huntington Library MSS MO 4763). After her second marriage\nto the twenty-one year old William Graham, even Carter was shocked,\ndubbing her \u201ca genius of [a] very eccentric a kind\u201d while\nSarah Scott wrote to her sister that they, being \u201cpure virgins\nand virtuous matrons\u201d, should \u201cdrown her in the Avon, and\ntry if she can be purified by water\u201d (Carter 1817,\n3. 88\u20139; Sarah Scott to Elizabeth Montagu, 27 November 1778,\nBath. Huntington Library, MSS MO 5391).\n\n\nMacaulay was almost thirty when she married her first husband, a\nScottish physician, George Macaulay, on 18 June 1760. Their marriage\nlasted only six years; he died in 1766. But during these years,\nMacaulay began to write her histories with his encouragement and with that of their neighbor Thomas Hollis.  The first volume of A History of England from\nthe Accession of James I. to that of the Brunswick Line appeared\nin 1763, the following three volumes were published at regular\nintervals in 1765, 1767 and 1768; these were printed for the author\nand sold by various booksellers. There was then a gap in production.\nVolume five was published by Edward and Charles Dilly in 1771.Volume\nsix and seven did not appear until ten years later, in 1781, and they\nwere published with a slightly different title, A History of\nEngland from the Accession of James I. to the Revolution, as was\nthe last volume, which came out in 1783. In 1767 she\npublished her Loose remarks on certain positions to be found in\nMr. Hobbes\u2019s Philosophical Rudiments of Government and Society,\nand in 1770 her first attack on Edmund Burke, Observations on a\nPamphlet entitled \u201cThoughts on the Cause of the Present\nDiscontents\u201d.\n\nMacaulay\u2019s brother John Sawbridge, a member of parliament, who was\nelected a London Alderman in 1769, became in the same year a founding\nmember of the Society of the Gentleman Supporters of the Bill of\nRights. This society was established with John Horne Tooke and others\nto support John Wilkes, who had been denied the parliamentary seat he\nhad won for Middlesex, as a result of being outlawed for having\npublished articles criticizing the ministry and the King (Hill 1992,\n55\u201362). However, by 1771, Sawbridge and Tooke had left this\nsociety because of its too narrow focus on Wilkes\u2019s interests.\nMacaulay\u2019s early volumes of history constitute a thinly veiled\ncritique of contemporary political events, and set out the broader\nprinciples of the Society of the Bill of Rights, by rehearsing the\narguments for the rights of the parliament and the liberties of the\npeople that fuelled the English Revolution.\n\nDuring the decade in which she let her major history lapse, she lived\nfor about two years at Bath in the house of a Reverend Wilson, who\nadopted her daughter, and had a statue made of the historian as Clio,\nwhich was controversially placed in the nave of the church of St\nStephen\u2019s Walbrook. During this period her health was not good, and in\n1777 she travelled to France with Elizabeth Arnold. While their aim\nwas the South of France, they did not get further than Paris, where\nMacaulay enjoyed the vibrant cultural life, though she was shocked by\nthe extent of French social inequality (Hays 1803, 5.295\u201396).\nShe wrote A History of England, from the Revolution to the present\ntime, in a series of letters to the Reverend Doctor Wilson during\nthis period, but the friendship came to an abrupt, bitter end with her\nsecond marriage to twenty-one year old William Graham in 1778. Graham\nwas the younger brother of Elizabeth Arnold and Dr James Graham, whose\nunconventional remedies Macaulay had followed as a cure for her\ncontinual ill health. This act brought a storm of gossip and\nrecrimination; she was accused by Wilson and Wilkes of having had an\naffair with the older Graham, and generally ridiculed for marrying a\nman who was her inferior in status and twenty-six years her\njunior.\n\nThe years of her second marriage appear to have been happy and\nfruitful; during this period she completed her History of\nEngland and wrote the Treatise on the Immutability of\nTruth, which was published in 1783. With her husband she toured\nthe United States, made a particular friend of Mercy Otis Warren, and\nvisited George Washington at Mount Vernon. Her last works were The\nLetters on Education and her response to Burke\u2019s Reflections\non the Revolution in France both of which appeared in 1790. She\ndied on 22 June 1791.\n",
