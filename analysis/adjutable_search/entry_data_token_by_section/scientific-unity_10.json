    "main_text": "Disunity and pluralism || The Stanford School\n5.1 The Stanford School\n\nAn influential picture of disunity comes from related works by members\nof the so-called Stanford School such as John Dupr\u00e9, Ian\nHacking, Peter Galison, Patrick Suppes and Nancy Cartwright. Disunity\nis, in general terms, a rejection of universalism and uniformity, both\nmethodological and metaphysical. Through their work, the rubric of\ndisunity has acquired a visibility parallel to the one once acquired\nby unity, as an inspiring philosophical rallying cry.\n\nFrom a methodological point of view, members of the school have\ndefended, from analysis of actual scientific practice, a model of\nlocal unity such as the so-called trading-zone, (Galison 1998), a\nplurality of scientific methods (Suppes 1978), a plurality of\nscientific styles with the function of establishing spaces of\nepistemic possibility and a plurality of kinds of unities (Hacking\n1996; Hacking follows the historian A.A. Crombie; for a criticism of\nHacking\u2019s historical epistemology see Kusch 2010).\n\nFrom a metaphysical point of view, the disunity of science can be\ngiven adequate metaphysical foundations that make pluralism compatible\nwith realism (Dupr\u00e9 1993; Cartwright 1983, 1999). Dupr\u00e9\nopposes a mechanistic paradigm of unity characterized by determinism,\nreductionism and essentialism. The paradigm spreads the values and\nmethods of physics to other sciences that he thinks are scientifically\nand socially deleterious. Disunity appears characterized by three\npluralistic theses: against essentialism\u2014there is always a\nplurality of classifications of reality into kinds; against\nreductionism\u2014there exists equal reality and causal efficacy of\nsystems at different levels of description (that is, the microlevel is\nnot causally complete, leaving room for downward causation); and\nagainst epistemological monism\u2014there is no single methodology\nthat supports a single criterion of scientificity, nor a universal\ndomain of its applicability, leaving only a plurality of epistemic and\nnon-epistemic virtues. The unitary concept of science should be\nunderstood, following the later Wittgenstein, as a family-resemblance\nconcept. (For a criticism of Dupr\u00e9\u2019s ideas, see Mitchell\n2003; Sklar 2003.)\n\nAgainst the universalism of explanatory laws, Cartwright has argued\nthat laws cannot be both universal and exactly true, as Hempel\nrequired in his influential account of explanation and demarcation;\nthere exist only patchworks of laws and local cooperation. Like\nDupr\u00e9, Cartwright adopts a kind of scientific realism but\ndenies that there is a universal order, whether represented by a\ntheory of everything or a corresponding a priori metaphysical\nprinciple (Cartwright 1983). Theories apply only locally, where and to\nthe extent that their interpretive models fit the phenomena studied,\nceteris paribus (Cartwright 1999). Cartwright\u2019s\npluralism is not just opposed to vertical reductionism but also\nhorizontal imperialism, or universalism and globalism. She explains\ntheir more or less general domain of application in terms of causal\ncapacities and arrangements she calls nomological machines\n(Cartwright 1989, 1999). The regularities they bring about depend on a\nshielded environment. As a matter of empiricism, this is the reason\nthat it is in the controlled environment of laboratories and\nexperiments, where causal interference is shielded off, that factual\nregularities are manifested. The controlled, stable, regular world is\nan engineered world. Representation rests on intervention (cf. Hacking\n1983; for criticisms see Winsberg et al. 2000; Hoefer 2003; Sklar\n2003; Howhy 2003; Teller 2004; McArthur 2006; Ruphy 2016).\n\nDisunity and autonomy of levels have been associated, conversely, with\nantirealism, meaning instrumentalist or empiricist heuristics. This\nincludes, for Fodor and Rosenberg, higher-level sciences such as\nbiology and sociology (Fodor 1974; Rosenberg 1994; Huneman 2010). It\nis against this picture that Dupr\u00e9\u2019s and\nCartwright\u2019s attacks on uniformly global unity and reductionism,\nabove, might seem surprising by including an endorsement, in causal\nterms, of\n realism.[4]\n Rohrlich has defended a similar realist position about weaker,\nconceptual (cognitive) antireductionism, although on the grounds of\nthe mathematical success of derivational explanatory reductions\n(Rohrlich 2001). Ruphy, however, has argued that antireductionism\nmerely amounts to a general methodological prescription and is too\nweak to yield uncontroversial metaphysical lessons; these are in fact\nbased on general metaphysical commitments external to scientific\npractice (Ruphy 2005, 2016).\n",
