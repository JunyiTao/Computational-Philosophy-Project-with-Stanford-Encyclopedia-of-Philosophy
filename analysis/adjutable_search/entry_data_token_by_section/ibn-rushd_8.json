    "main_text": "Medicine\n7. Medicine\n\nWritings in medicine occupy an important place in Ibn Rushd\u2019s\ncareer. The practice of medicine was not his profession: \u201cit is\nthis part of medicine that I believe restrains me from being perfect\nin this art. And that I haven\u2019t had much practice\u201d\n(Kulliyy\u0101t VII.517). Even so, he left many interesting\ntexts: a Commentary on Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s Medical\nPoem, his al-Kulliyy\u0101t (General Principles of\nMedicine), and various writings and commentaries on Galen.\nIndeed, it has been suggested that, near the end of Ibn Rushd\u2019s\ncareer, he was forced to set aside his philosophical project of\nwriting the long commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s texts, and turn\ninstead to Galen\u2019s text on medicine (Al-\u02bfAlaw\u012b\n1986a).\n\nThe commentary on Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 challenges the usual conception\nof a rivalry between the two great Islamic philosophers. He says that\nhe chose to comment on Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s Poem\nbecause it is \u201cbetter than many of the introductions written in\nmedicine\u201d (CommIbnS\u012bn\u0101 40). Even so, during\nthe last decade of Ibn Rushd\u2019s life, it is Galen who becomes one\nof his principal authorities. Still, Galen is often a target of\ncriticism. In al-Kulliyy\u0101t, for example, a work that he\nrepeatedly revised (G\u00e4tje 1986), the revisions often move in a\ndirection that is increasingly critical of Galen\n(Kulliyy\u0101t II.162, II.184, etc.).\n\nMedicine, for Ibn Rushd, is an art rather than a science, concerned\nwith practice rather than theory (Chandelier 2019). According to the\nprologue of al-Kulliyy\u0101t,\n\nThe art of medicine is an art that acts (sin\u0101\u02bfa\nf\u0101\u02bfila) based on true principles; we seek through it to\npreserve the health of the human body and to eliminate disease as much\nas possible in each body. So the goal of this art is not to heal\nwithout fail (l\u0101 budda), but rather to act\nappropriately, to the appropriate extent and time, while waiting to\nachieve its goal, as with the art of navigation and the command of an\narmy. (prol. 127)\n\n\nThis definition is based on the famous division of the arts into what\nbelongs to the sphere of necessity and what belongs to the sphere of\npossibility. The art of medicine does not belong to the sphere where\nconsequences follow actions necessarily, as with arts like carpentry.\nIn medicine, even if the physician acts based on scientific\nprinciples, the intended end does not necessarily follow. As he puts\nit, \u201cApparently, we do not have any of the premises that bring\nus certainty in many of these pursuits. But even so we must try,\ninsofar as we are able\u201d (Kulliyy\u0101t II.208). The\npractical dimension of medicine is similarly central to his commentary\non Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, which begins with Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s\nstatement that \u201cMedicine is preserving health and curing\ndisease,\u201d and comments: \u201cThis is the definition of\nmedicine, and its completion would be to say that medicine is an art\nwhose action is preserving health and curing disease, based on science\nand experience\u201d (CommIbnS\u012bn\u0101 46; see also\nKulliyy\u0101t prol.131). As one may notice, Ibn Rushd\ninsists on acting in both texts.\n\nThe purpose of al-Kulliyy\u0101t, according to its prologue,\nis to draw from the art of medicine\n\na summary (jumla), sufficiently concise and brief to serve as\nan introduction for those who would like to explore the parts of the\nart, and also as a memorandum (tadhkira) for those who would\nlike to reflect on the art. We seek those statements that correspond\nto the truth, even if they contradict the opinions of people who\nbelong to the art. (prol. 127)\n\n\nHowever, al-Kulliyy\u0101t is not a book of medical\ngeneralities, as some translations tend to suggest. It is rather a\nbook on the universals of medicine (kulliyy\u0101t f\u012b\nal-\u1e6dibb), as its title suggests\u2014that is, on the\nfoundations, principles, and basic rules that regulate medical theory\nand practice. It thus provides the foundations\n(us\u1e6duqs\u0101t) of the medical art\n(Kulliyy\u0101t III.282).\n\nIn the same vein, al-Kulliyy\u0101t is far from being a\ntextbook (kunn\u0101sh); it is rather written against the\ntradition of textbooks that prevailed in the art of medicine. It is a\ndefense of the art of \u201csyllogistic\u201d medicine against\nexperiential medicine. He says: \u201cAs for those who limit\nthemselves to the method of the textbooks without knowing the\nuniversal method, they will certainly make mistakes, as do the doctors\nof our time. As for limiting oneself to universal matters, this may be\npossible if the doctor is very skilled. Therefore, one of the\nconsidered conditions of perfection in the arts is that the craftsman\nhave the power to deduce what he needs to deduce\u201d\n(Kulliyy\u0101t VII.552). The status of experience in\nmedicine is limited but not entirely excluded: \u201cOnce the\nuniversals of the art of medicine are acquired, one needs the\nexperience from which particular premises are acquired in order to be\nused in each particular case. These premises cannot be written in a\nbook, because they are unlimited\u201d (Kulliyy\u0101t\nVII.517). Ibn Rushd makes an exception, however, in criticizing the\nmanuals and textbooks on medical particulars, for Ab\u016b Marw\u0101n\nIbn Zuhr, whose al-Tays\u012br can be trusted because the\nparticulars it contains conform to the universal teachings of\ntheoretical medicine (Kulliyy\u0101t VII.583).\n\nIn sum, al-Kulliyy\u0101t is an attempt to advance medical\npractice from the level of the infinite particulars, which cannot be\nassembled in a book, to the level of the rules\n(q\u0101n\u016bn) and established principles\n(dust\u016br) that govern them (Kulliyy\u0101t\nIII.282). It is an attempt to upgrade medical discourse to the level\nof a science, linking its premises and principles to the Aristotelian\nnatural sciences (Al-\u02bfAlaw\u012b 1986a, 180). This holistic\nmethodology is characteristic of how Ibn Rushd approached the arts and\nsciences of his time. It shows his inclination to organize them in a\nway that protects them from chaos and elevates them to the level of\nscientific practice, established on the basis of universal principles\nand foundations. Particular cases, since they are unlimited, cannot be\ndealt with unless there are general laws that help us to deduce\ndecisions about particulars on the basis of principles and\nfoundations.\n",
