    "main_text": "The Argument from Cognitive Science || Articulability\n7.3 Articulability\n\nAccording to C3, propositional knowledge corresponds to\n\u201cdeclarative\u201d knowledge\u2014to a sort of knowledge that\nis, at least in principle, verbalizable. Opponents of intellectualism\noften uses C3 in a novel argument against intellectualism: if\npropositional knowledge has to be verbalizable, then knowledge-how\ncannot be propositional knowledge, for often subjects know how to\nperform tasks even though they cannot explain how they do it (Schiffer\n2002; Devitt 2011; Adams 2009; Wallis 2008). On behalf of\nintellectualism, there do seem to be cases in which you come to know\nhow to do something precisely by consulting a manual and learning some\npropositions (see, e.g., Snowdon 2004: 12; Bengson and Moffett 2011a:\n8; and Katzoff 1984: 65ff). Moreover, it is not clear that the\nanti-intellectualist demand that propositional knowledge be always\nverbalizable is motivated. In fact, it seems to conflate knowing how\nto perform a task with knowing how to explain how the task is\nperformed (cf. Fodor 1968: 634; Stalnaker 2012). Stanley (2011b:\n161) points out that there is a sense in which knowledge-how\nis always verbalizable. A punch-drunk boxer who can at best\ndemonstratively refer to his re-enactment of the way of boxing against\nsouthpaws, and says, \u201cThis is the way I fight against a\nsouthpaw\u201d intuitively knows that this is the way he fights\nagainst southpaws. This knowledge has an essential demonstrative or\nindexical component. But the same goes for much other propositional\nknowledge like, for example, the knowledge we express by saying,\n\u201cThis is the tool for the job\u201d, or \u201cThat is going to\nbe trouble\u201d. This reply assumes that ways to execute tasks are\nostensible and as such can be picked up by a demonstrative.\nThis does not need to be so: on any single occasion, one may only act\non parts of a way. So, one will not thereby be able to pick\nup the general way one\u2019s knowledge-how is about.\nAnother reply on behalf of intellectualism is to point out that\npractical concepts for tasks differ from \u201csemantic\u201d\nconcepts for the same tasks precisely in that, even if propositional,\nthey are not necessarily verbalizable. \n",
