    "main_text": "\n\nTo say you are in a state that is (phenomenally) conscious is to\nsay\u2014on a certain understanding of these terms\u2014that you\nhave an experience, or a state there is something\nit\u2019s like for you to be in. Feeling pain or dizziness,\nappearances of color or shape, and episodic thought are some widely\naccepted examples. Intentionality, on the other hand, has to do with\nthe directedness, aboutness, or reference of mental states\u2014the\nfact that, for example, you think of or about\nsomething. Intentionality includes, and is sometimes seen as\nequivalent to, what is called \u201cmental representation\u201d.\n\nConsciousness and intentionality can seem to pervade much or all of\nmental life\u2014perhaps they somehow account for what it is to have\na mind; at any rate they seem to be important, broad aspects of it.\nBut achieving a general understanding of either is an enormous\nchallenge. Part of this lies in figuring out how they are related. Are\nthey independent? Is one (or each) to be understood in terms of the\nother? How we address the issues to which these questions give rise\ncan have major implications for our views about mind, knowledge, and\nvalue.\n\nSections (1) and (2) offer introductory accounts of what is meant by\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d and \u201cintentionality\u201d\nrespectively, highlighting relevant difficulties of interpretation.\nThen influential perspectives that have emerged in phenomenological\n(Section 3) and analytic (Section 4) philosophy are sketched so as to\nfacilitate recognition of some common, recurrent themes. These\nconcern, first: the question of whether either consciousness or\nintentionality is \u201cinternal to the subject\u201d or instead\nessentially tied to environment\u2014the theme of\ndetachability. The second concerns the issue of how (or\nwhether) to distinguish basic kinds of intentionality\u2014e.g.,\nintellectual and sensory; conceptual and non-conceptual\u2014and\nwhere to place consciousness with respect to such divisions: this is\nthe theme of basic forms. Third, there are questions about\nhow consciousness is related to self-consciousness\u2014the theme of\nreflexivity. Section (5) describes diverse perspectives on\nthe consciousness-intentionality relationship engaging with the themes\nof detachability and basic forms. Here separatist views that divorce\nconsciousness from intentionality are contrasted with various\nintentionalist views that bind them together: externalist and\nnon-externalist; reductive and non-reductive; restrictive and\ninclusive; reflexivist and non-reflexivist. This section links to two\nsupplementary discussions: one summarizes recent ways of arguing for\nintentionalism; the other considers how intentionalism figures in\nclassic phenomenological writings. Section (6) focuses on the\nrestrictive/inclusive contrast, and on issues regarding\n\u201ccognitive phenomenology\u201d. Section (7) returns to the\nreflexivist theme, and higher-order representationalist and\nself-representationalist accounts of consciousness\u2014linking to a\nsupplementary discussion of consciousness of self. Section (8)\nconsiders how one\u2019s view of the relationship of consciousness to\nintentionality might figure in one\u2019s understanding of its place\nin the mind generally. Finally, Section (9) suggests some ways in\nwhich the issues of previous sections impinge on four broad areas of\nphilosophical interest: the nature and boundaries of mind and self;\nthe place of consciousness and intentionality in explanation; forms of\nknowledge and justification; and kinds and instances of value.\n",
