    "main_text": "Steady-state Cosmology || Return of the Cosmological Principle\n8.4 Return of the Cosmological Principle\n\nHere Bondi speaks of Milne\u2019s cosmological principle. According\nto Milne\u2019s principle, every observer in the universe should get\nthe same world picture, that is, should make precisely the same\nobservations of the universe at the same moment as any other observer\n(Milne 1934b). Uniformity over spatial slices is guaranteed by\nMilne\u2019s invoking of the principle. Yet Milne\u2019s universe\nevolves, it changes its form over time. Hence it has no temporal\nuniformity. Bondi felt that this raised the possibility that physics\nitself might change over time. Because of this risk, Bondi generalized\nMilne\u2019s cosmological principle into what he called the\nperfect cosmological principle [= PCP]. According to this\nprinciple, all observers at all places and at all\ntimes will look out upon the same unchanging, unevolving,\nuniverse. Such a universe is a universe in a steady-state\u2014hence\nthe name.\n\nClearly, PCP is a daring, indeed heroic, interpretation of a\nmethodological necessity. Forty years after the fact, Bondi described\nthe \u201cphilosophical attitude\u201d which underlay his\n\u201cimplausible\u201d PCP:\n\nBut the essential point of the philosophy was and is that if the\nuniverse was evolving and changing, then there is no reason to trust\nwhat we call the laws of physics, established by experiments performed\nhere and now, to have permanent validity. (Bondi 1990, p. 192)\n\n\nHence, or so Bondi\u2019s argument goes, since there is reason\nnot to trust the laws of physics if the universe is\nevolving, let us presume that the universe is not\nevolving and changing; that is, let us presume PCP. Although the\nprinciple (and the theory which results from it\u2014steady state\ncosmology) is, as McVittie remarked, \u201cmuch more restrictive than\ngeneral relativity\u201d; (McVittie 1990, p. 45) it is this very\nrestrictiveness which satisfies Bondi\u2019s Popperian wishes:\n\nFor the correct argument has always been that the steady state model\nwas the one that could be disproved most easily by observation,\nTherefore, it should take precedence over other less disprovable ones\nuntil it has been disproved. (Bondi and Kilmister 1959, p. 55\u20136)\n\n\nIn another place, Bondi makes a similar point: \u201cComparison with\nobservation becomes then possible and renders the PCP liable to\nobservational disproof. This possibility of a clear-cut disproof\nestablishes the scientific status of PCP\u201d (Bondi 1957, p. 198).\nComments such as this make clear Bondi\u2019s committment to a\nPopperian addition to the basic deductive methodology he inherited\nfrom Milne.\n",
