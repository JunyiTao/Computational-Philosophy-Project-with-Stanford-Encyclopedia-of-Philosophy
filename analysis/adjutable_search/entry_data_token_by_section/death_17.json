    "main_text": "The Timing Puzzle || Priorism\n4.2 Priorism\n\nIf we reject intrinsic hedonism, we might conclude that death can make\nus worse off not just while we die but at other times as well. If we\nadopt some form of preferentialism, we can take the view that things\nmay make us worse off at the time one of our desires is thwarted.\nSuppose that, as George Pitcher (1984) suggested, a desire that you\nhave now may be thwarted by your death, even though you will die\nseveral months from now. In that case, it might be now that your death\nmakes you worse off than you would have been had you not died.\nPitcher\u2019s assumptions suggest that priorism is true:\ndeath may make you worse off before you die. It may harm you\nretroactively.\n\nIdentifying a time something makes us worse off seems rather easy in\ncases, such as the examples of infection or thwarted desire, in which\nit brings us have pain or other things that are intrinsically bad for\nus. But what about cases in which something is bad for us due to the\nfact that it precludes our having things that are intrinsically good\nfor us? In cases like this, the victim incurs deprivation\nharm. But at what time are such persons worse off than they\notherwise would be? When, in particular, does dying painlessly make a\nperson worse off?\n\nIs it possible to defend a concurrentist answer to this question about\ndeath? Julian Lamont (1998) says we incur deprivation harm at the time\nsome event ensures that we will not retain or attain some good that is\notherwise available. Call such an event an ensuring event.\nDeath may itself be an ensuring event, he thought, so death and\ndeprivation harm may occur simultaneously.\n\nBut this suggestion appears doubtful. Recall the earlier case in which\nwe come to be infected and only later experience any symptoms. The\nevent of coming to be infected is overall bad for us, but it seems\nimplausible to say that this makes us worse off than we otherwise\nwould be at the time we are infected. Instead, it seems,\ncoming to be infected makes us worse off later, while we are sick. We\nare unlikely to adopt concurrentism as our story concerning catching\nthe flu, which makes it doubtful as our story concerning deprivation\nharm.\n",
