    "main_text": "The Grandfather Paradox\n2. The Grandfather Paradox\nThe most important objection to the logical possibility of\nbackwards time travel is the so-called Grandfather paradox. This\nparadox has actually convinced many people that backwards time travel\nis impossible:\n The dead giveaway that true time-travel is flatly\nimpossible arises from the well-known \u201cparadoxes\u201d it\nentails. The classic example is \u201cWhat if you go back into the\npast and kill your grandfather when he was still a little\nboy?\u201d\u2026So complex and hopeless are the\nparadoxes\u2026that the easiest way out of the irrational chaos that\nresults is to suppose that true time-travel is, and forever will be,\nimpossible. (Asimov 1995 [2003, 276\u20137])\ntravel into one\u2019s past\u2026would seem to give rise to all\nsorts of logical problems, if you were able to change history. For\nexample, what would happen if you killed your parents before you were\nborn. It might be that one could avoid such paradoxes by some\nmodification of the concept of free will. But this will not be\nnecessary if what I call the chronology protection conjecture\nis correct: The laws of physics prevent closed timelike curves\nfrom appearing. (Hawking, 1992,\n604)[14]\n\nThe paradox comes in different forms. Here\u2019s one version:\n If time travel was logically possible then the time\ntraveller could return to the past and in a suicidal rage destroy his\ntime machine before it was completed and murder his younger self. But\nif this was so a necessary condition for the time trip to have\noccurred at all is removed, and we should then conclude that the time\ntrip did not occur. Hence if the time trip did occur, then it did not\noccur. Hence it did not occur, and it is necessary that it\ndid not occur. To reply, as it is standardly done, that our time\ntraveller cannot change the past in this way, is a petitio\nprincipii. Why is it that the time traveller is constrained in\nthis way? What mysterious force stills his sudden suicidal rage?\n(Smith, 1985, 58)\n\nThe idea is that backwards time travel is impossible because if it\noccurred, time travellers would attempt to do things such as kill\ntheir younger selves (or their grandfathers etc.). We know that doing\nthese things\u2014indeed, changing the past in any way\u2014is\nimpossible. But were there time travel, there would then be nothing\nleft to stop these things happening. If we let things get to the stage\nwhere the time traveller is facing Grandfather with a loaded weapon,\nthen there is nothing left to prevent the impossible from\noccurring. So we must draw the line earlier: it must be impossible for\nsomeone to get into this situation at all; that is, backwards time\ntravel must be impossible.\n\n\nIn order to defend the possibility of time travel in the face of this\nargument we need to show that time travel is not a sure route to doing\nthe impossible. So, given that a time traveller has gone to the past\nand is facing Grandfather, what could stop her killing Grandfather?\nSome science fiction authors resort to the idea of chaperones or time\nguardians who prevent time travellers from changing the past\u2014or\nto mysterious forces of logic. But it is hard to take these ideas\nseriously\u2014and more importantly, it is hard to make them work in\ndetail when we remember that changing the past is impossible. (The\nchaperone is acting to ensure that the past remains as it\nwas\u2014but the only reason it ever was that way is because of his\nvery\n actions.)[15] \n Fortunately there is a better\nresponse\u2014also to be found in the science fiction literature, and\nbrought to the attention of philosophers by Lewis (1976). What would\nstop the time traveller doing the impossible? She would fail\n\u201cfor some commonplace reason\u201d, as Lewis (1976, 150) puts\nit. Her gun might jam, a noise might distract her, she might slip on a\nbanana peel, etc. Nothing more than such ordinary occurrences is\nrequired to stop the time traveller killing Grandfather. Hence\nbackwards time travel does not entail the occurrence of impossible\nevents\u2014and so the above objection is defused.\n",
