    "main_text": "Deliberation and Choice || Rational Eligibility\n4.3 Rational Eligibility\n\nThe idea expressed in the distinction between optimization and\nmaximization in subsection 4.1 can be expressed more generally in\nterms of the idea of rational eligibility. To say that an alternative\nis rationally eligible is to mean that choosing it would not be an\nunjustified choice. Which alternatives are judged rationally eligible\nmay vary with the theory of justified choice. According to\nmaximization as a theory of justified choice, an alternative is\nrationally eligible if and only if there is no better alternative.\n\nIsaac Levi (1986; 2004) argues for\n\u201cv-admissibility\u201d as a criterion of justified\nchoice. For v-admissibility, value incomparability does not\npose a problem for the possibility of justified choice. An alternative\nis v-admissible if and only if it is optimal according to at\nleast one of the relevant considerations at hand. In some conflicts of\nvalue, maximization and v-admissibility specify the same\nalternatives as rationally eligible. Suppose that alternative\nX is better than alternative Y with respect to\nconsideration A and alternative Y is better than\nalternative X with respect to consideration B.\nAccording to maximization as a theory of justified choice, both\nX and Y are rationally eligible; neither alternative\nis better than the other with respect to A and B\ntaken together. Both alternatives are also rationally eligible\naccording to v-admissibility; X is optimal with\nrespect to A and Y is optimal with respect to\nB.\n\nIn some conflicts of value, maximization and v-admissibility\nspecify different sets of alternatives as rationally eligible.\nV-admissibility is more restrictive than maximization (Levi\n2004). Add to the above example alternative Z. Suppose that\nX is better than Z, which is better than Y,\nall with respect to A. Suppose also that Y is better\nthan Z, which is better than X, all with respect to\nB. According to maximization as a theory of justified choice,\nX, Y, and Z are rationally eligible; no\nalternative is better than the other with respect to A and\nB taken together. However, Z is not rationally\neligible according to v-admissibility. Z is not\noptimal with respect to A. Nor is it optimal with respect to\nB. Only X and Y are rationally eligible\naccording to v-admissibility. According to Levi,\nv-admissibility captures what he takes to be a plausible\njudgment\u2014namely, that it would be unjustified to choose the\nalternative that is second worse on all relevant respects (Levi 2004).\nThe plausibility of this judgment might be questioned. Suppose that\nZ is only slightly worse than X with respect to\nA and Z is only slightly worse than Y with\nrespect to B. Does the judgment still hold?\n\nFor Joseph Raz, incomparability also does not pose a problem for the\npossibility of justified choice (1997). If incomparable options give\nus reasons to choose both alternatives, they are both rationally\neligible from the perspective of justified choice. As such, the choice\nof either alternative is justified on the basis of reason.\n\nOne question that arises is this. If an agent has reason to choose\neither alternative and they are not equally good, what makes her\nchoice of one alternative over another intelligible to her? For Raz,\nwhat explains the choice of one alternative over the other is the\nexercise of the will. By the will, Raz has in mind \u201cthe ability\nto choose and perform intentional actions\u201d and \u201cthe most\ntypical exercise or manifestation of the will is in choosing among\noptions that reason merely renders eligible\u201d (1997, 111).\n\nJohn Finnis advances a similar view in response to the question of\nintelligibility. Finnis writes, \u201cin free choice, one has reasons\nfor each of the alternative options, but these reasons are not\ncausally determinative.\u2026 No factor but the choosing itself\nsettles which alternative is chosen\u201d (1997, 220). In a\nchoice between alternatives each favored by different, incomparable\nvalues, even though there are reasons to choose both alternatives,\nbecause reasons are not causally determinative, the lack of a reason\nto choose one alternative over another need not render the choice\nunintelligible.\n\nDonald Regan challenges this view. According to Regan, unless grounded\nin an adequate reason, \u201ca decision to go one way rather than\nanother will be something that happened to the agent rather than\nsomething she did\u201d and hence be unintelligible to the agent\nherself (1997, 144). Suppose the agent has no more reason to choose\none alternative over another and the choice, as suggested above, is\nsettled by her wants. On Regan\u2019s view, if the agent\u2019s\nchoice is to be intelligible to her, her wants must be grounded in\nreasons. Because she has no more reason to choose one alternative over\nanother initially, the reasons grounding her wants must be available\nto her only after the initially relevant reasons are exhausted. This\nstrikes Regan as implausible (1997, 150). Regan concludes that no\nchoice between incomparable bearers of value is intelligible in the\nways suggested by Raz or Finnis.\n",
