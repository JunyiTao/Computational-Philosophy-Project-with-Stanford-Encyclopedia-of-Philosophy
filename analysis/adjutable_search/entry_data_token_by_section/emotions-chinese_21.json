    "main_text": "Emotions in Early Chinese Philosophical Texts || The Laozi (Dao De Jing)\n5.6 The Zhuangzi\n\nThe Zhuangzi is a Daoist text in the late Warring States\nperiod. It is believed to be written by a Daoist philosopher Zhuangzi\n(369\u2013286 BCE) but his authorship is debated especially in the\nouter chapters (wai pian \u5916\u7bc7, chapters 8 through\n22) and the miscellaneous chapters (za pian \u96dc\u7bc7,\nchapters 23 through 33) of the text. It consists of stories and\nanecdotes that deliver the insightful and intriguing messages of\nDaoism and the Daoist way of life. It also develops an inspiring\napproach to emotions and their foundations in the natural inclinations\nof the human mind.  Although qing refers to the essential\nnature of things in some passages of the Zhuangzi, in other\npassages it refers to the psychological foundation of affective\ndispositions. Therefore, it is important to see how he\nunderstands qing and how\nqing and emotions are related in the Zhuangzi.\n\nZhuangzi believes that emotions are natural phenomena like wind, rain,\nand thunder. As we cannot change wind, rain, and thunder, we cannot\navoid naturally arising feelings. He states that\n\n\nJoy, anger, grief, delight, worry, regret, fickleness, inflexibility,\nmodesty, willfulness, candor, insolence\u2014 music from empty holes,\nmushrooms springing up in dampness, day and night replacing each other\nbefore us, and no one knows where they sprout from. Let it be! Let it\nbe! (Zhuangzi, 2.2; Watson 2013: 8)\n\n\nIn this passage, Zhuangzi lists emotions along with natural events\nsuch as growing mushrooms and alternating day and night.\nZhuangzi\u2019s point in this passage is that, like natural\nphenomena, emotions are aroused spontaneously without any plans or\nforethoughts. This naturalistic approach, however, does not imply that\nemotions are unpredictable and unregulated chaos and one should not\nfeel or react to any emotions. Rather, it suggests that one should\nfeel emotions without any expectations or suppositions. Unlike early\nConfucian philosophers such as Mencius or Xunzi who searches for the\nontological or moral foundation of emotions in qing (\u60c5) or\nxin (\u5fc3 the heart-mind), Zhuangzi, in this passage, takes\nemotions as they are without relating them to their foundations or\nanalyzing them with their originations. He suggests that one should\nnot judge or inculcate them with social conventions or moral\nnorms.\n\nIt is, therefore, meaningless to feel emotions as positive, negative,\nattractive or repulsive as it is equally meaningless to describe day\nand night as positive or negative. Zhuangzi believes that developing\nlikes or dislikes (affective interpretations or evaluations of our\nsensory and perceptual interaction with the world) is an inappropriate\nway to feel or understand naturally arising emotions and can hurt\nindividuals who are caught by their likes and dislikes. Thus, he says\nthat one should not \u201cby his likes and dislikes do any inward\nharm to himself\u201d (Zhuangzi, 5.6). In the following\nconversation, he explains his thoughts on how one should approach\nfeelings and emotions.\n\n\nHuizi said to Zhuangzi, \u201cCan a man really be without feelings\n[qing]?\u201d\n\nZhuangzi: \u201cYes\u201d.\n\nHuizi: \u201cBut a man who has no feelings [qing] \u2014how\ncan you call him a man?\u201d\n\nZhuangzi: \u201cThe Way gave him a face; Heaven gave him a\nform\u2014why can\u2019t you call him a man?\u201d\n\nHuizi: \u201cBut if you\u2019ve already called him a man, how can he\nbe without feelings [qing]?\u201d\n\nZhuangzi: \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean by feelings\n[qing ]. When I talk about having no [qing]\nfeelings, I mean that a man doesn\u2019t allow likes or dislikes to\nget in and do him harm. He just lets things be the way they are and\ndoesn\u2019t try to help life along\u201d. (Zhuangzi, 5.6;\nWatson 2013: 40\u201341)\n\n\nIn this passage, Zhuangzi distinguishes two different forms of\nqing. When he says \u201ca man has no feelings\u201d, he is\ntalking about the feelings of likes and dislikes. This type of\nfeelings can affect us and motivate us to accept and follow certain\nviewpoints, rules, or norms. However, natural feelings come to\none\u2019s mind without bringing in any suppositions or judgments of\nacceptance and rejection. In their analysis of this passage, Ma and\nvan Brakel (2021: 137) state by quoting Graham (1981 [2001: 82]) that\n\n\n\nZhuangzi himself says explicitly that Huizi\u2019s and his\nunderstandings of qing are different: \u201cYou are\nmisunderstanding what I mean by qing\u201d (Legge 1891:\n235); \u201cshifei\u201d [evaluative judgments such as\nlikings and dislikings] is what I mean by\n\u201cqing\u201d.\n\n\nHere one can see Zhuangzi\u2019s naturalistic or phenomenological\napproach to emotions. According to him, having no feelings does not\nmean that one should feel no emotions. Instead, he suggests that one\nshould take emotions simply as spontaneously and naturally arising\nfeelings so that sadness and pleasure cannot find a way in to disturb\nand hurt one\u2019s mind. Thus he states that \u201cIf you are\ncontent with the time and willing to follow along, then grief and joy\nhave no way to enter\u201d (Zhuangzi 3.5; Watson 2013: 21).\nZhuangzi, therefore, does not promote asceticism, fatalism, or apathy.\nInstead, he emphasizes one\u2019s full acceptance of naturally given\nqing (xing ming zhi qing\n\u6027\u547d\u4e4b\u60c5 naturally given affective\ndisposition). Emotions come and go like day and night and we should be\nhappy and sad as they show up and strike us with certain moods and\nfeelings.\n\nFor this reason, Zhuangzi warns about one\u2019s desire (yu\n\u6b32) to satisfy and extend one\u2019s likes and dislikes and\nemphasizes the importance of accepting and accommodating the naturally\narising feelings of emotion. He states that \n\n\nIf you try to fulfill all your appetites and desires and indulge your\nlikes and dislikes, then you will bring affliction to the true form of\nyour inborn nature and fate [xing ming zhi qing\n\u6027\u547d\u4e4b\u60c5, naturally\ngiven qing]. (Zhuangzi, 24.1; Watson 2013: 199) \n\n\nIn this passage, he argues that one\u2019s desire is the foundation\nof one\u2019s likes and dislikes that cause the deviance from or\ndistortion of naturally flowing emotions. Once one\u2019s likes and\ndislikes distort or mislead one\u2019s natural feelings, one is\nlikely to be caught by mental struggle and psychological illness such\nas frustration, depression, and stress. Therefore, he suggests one\nshould preserve and follow the spontaneous nature of the mind in\none\u2019s feelings and emotions. He states that \n\n\nPeople of today, when they come to ordering their bodies and\nregulating their minds, too often do it in a manner like that which\nthe border guard described. They turn their backs on the Heavenly\npart, deviate from the inborn nature, destroy the true form\n[qing], and annihilate the spirit, just to be doing what the\ncrowd is doing. (Zhuangzi, 25.6; Watson 2013: 220)\n\n\nPerhaps one of the stimulating ways to understand Zhuangzi\u2019s\nview on emotions and naturally given qing (xing ming zhi\nqing \u6027\u547d\u4e4b\u60c5) is to compare his approach to qing\nwith that of Xunzi\u2019s. Xunzi believes that qing can be\nperfected by ritual, music, or other means of self-cultivation. To\nZhuangzi, the whole idea of modifying or transforming qing\nthrough Confucian propriety and self-cultivation for the purpose of\nsocial order and moral edification misses critically important\nproperties of qing, i.e., its natural spontaneity and\nunbiased openness. According to him, our feelings and emotions are\nimportant to us not because they can be perfected or matured but\nbecause they help us to sense and feel things without any premeditated\nor predetermined viewpoints or biases imposed upon by social\nconventions and moral norms. He stresses that one should preserve\none\u2019s naturally given qing because one\u2019s\nachievement of the ultimate rightness consists in not losing\none\u2019s natural qing. (Zhuangzi, 8.1).\nTherefore, he criticizes Confucian virtues of benevolence\n(ren) and righteousness (yi) by stating that \n\n\nMy definition of expertness has nothing to do with benevolence and\nrighteousness; it means following the true form of your inborn nature\n[xing ming zhi qing \u6027\u547d\u4e4b\u60c5 naturally given\nqing]. (Zhuangzi, 8.3; Watson 2013: 63) \n\n\nHansen (1995: 21) explains these contrastive approaches to\nqing by stating that \n\n\nZhuangzi\u2026is normally positive about \u60c5\nqingreality responses. Xunzi is notoriously\nnegative. Zhuangzi is negative about Confucian traditions and\nconventions. Xunzi is positive about them. \n\n\nAs Hansen describes in his comparison between Xunzi\u2019s and\nZhuangzi\u2019s views, there are at least two contrastive approaches\nto emotions in early Chinese philosophy. According to Xunzi\u2019s\nConfucian approach, emotions are understood as the manifestations of\nhuman nature and the developmental potential of virtue. According to\nZhuangzi\u2019s Daoist approach, however, the ontological foundation\nand moral cultivation of emotions are neither important nor necessary\nin understanding and feeling emotions. Emotions are spontaneously and\nnaturally arising feelings that we should not attempt to judge and\nmodify for the sake of human nature, moral norms or social\nconventions.\n",
