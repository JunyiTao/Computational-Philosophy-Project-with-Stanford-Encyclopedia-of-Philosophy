    "main_text": "\n\nGabriel Marcel (1889\u20131973) was a philosopher, drama critic,\nplaywright and musician. He converted to Catholicism in 1929 and his\nphilosophy was later described as \u201cChristian\nExistentialism\u201d (most famously in Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s\n\u201cExistentialism is a Humanism\u201d) a term he initially\nendorsed but later repudiated. In addition to his numerous\nphilosophical publications, he was the author of some thirty dramatic\nworks. Marcel gave the Gifford Lectures in Aberdeen in\n1949\u20131950, which appeared in print as the two-volume The\nMystery of Being, and the William James Lectures at Harvard in\n1961\u20131962, which were collected and published as The\nExistential Background of Human Dignity.\n",
