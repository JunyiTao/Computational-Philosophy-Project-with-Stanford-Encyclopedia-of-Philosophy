    "main_text": "The Commentaries of the Book of Changes || . The Divination Approach\n3. Face Changes with Courage and Dignity\n\nOn the surface, these three approaches\u2014the cosmological\napproach, the rational humanistic approach, and the divination\napproach\u2014appear to steadily narrow the scope of philosophizing\nchange. They seem to continuously move away from the cosmos to the\nhuman world, and from the human world to an individual\u2019s moral\ncogitations. One may even say that in this narrowing of the scope, we\nsee a retreat from the empirical to the intellectual, and from the\nobjective to the subjective.\n\nYet, in their own ways, these three approaches offer answers to the\nhuman anxiety over uncertainty. They give hope to readers by\ntransforming the trigrams and hexagrams into symbols to discuss the\nhuman roles in the unfolding of the universe (Cheng 2003; Cheng &\nNg 2009; Redmond & Hon 2014: 140\u201357; R. Smith 2008:\n31\u201348). Together, they make three arguments:\n\nBecause the universe is an open system that is self-generative and\nself-transformative, we must live with ceaseless change;\nBecause changes take place all the time, we must find ways to\nunderstand their patterns and to navigate their complexity;\nIn every moment, we must be ready to make difficult decisions in\norder to find peace and comfort in life.\n\n\nBy emphasizing our need to make difficult decisions in the world of\nconstant changes, the authors of Changes are not suggesting\nus to be over-worried. Rather, they remind us of our limited ability\nin understanding the complexity and fluidity of our world. After\nhonestly accepting our finitude, the authors of Changes\nsuggest us to be active and aggressive in reshaping our situation.\nHere, the turnaround rests on our wisdom of knowing what we can and\ncannot do. We must remain humble and circumspective in our every step.\nBut based on what we know, we make plans to gradually improve our\nenvironment. Like a droplet, we rise and fall with the wave of the\nocean. Since both the objective reality and the subjective condition\nare perpetually shifting, the moment of finding a harmonious\nintegration between attainable and unattainable is always transient.\nWhen either the objective reality and the subjective condition\nchanges, or worse still, both of them change, the whole equilibrium is\nupset, and the process of searching for a new equilibrium has to begin\nanew. On this note, that is no better ending to the Changes\nthan hexagram Weiji \u672a\u6fdf (\u4dff Ferrying\nIncomplete, #64) because the act of balancing the competing claims and\nfinding certainty in an uncertain world are going to be continuous\nwithout end.\n\nFor us today, this philosophy of change is refreshing and energizing\nbecause it encourages us to be spontaneous, creative, and experimental\nin coping with the complexity in life. It also draws our attention to\nthe reality of the 21st century world that is dynamic,\nfluid, multi-layered, and multi-causal due to the global economy and\nthe transnational networks of circulation. More importantly, it\nreminds us that we are both a subject and an object in making\ndecisions. On the one hand, we are the products of our environment; on\nthe other hand, we are active players in reshaping our environment. In\nthe end, we are who we are\u2014constantly finding our paths in an\never-changing world. \n",
