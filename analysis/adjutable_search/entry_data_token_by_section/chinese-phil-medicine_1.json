    "main_text": "Introduction: Shared Intellectual Contexts || Yin-yang, Qi and Wuxing\n1.1 Yin-yang, Qi and Wuxing\n\n\nTheories of qi and yin and yang also are\nimportantly pursued in early philosophical works. Several Warring\nStates texts contain references to the nature of qi,\nyin and yang, and their relation to health and\nlongevity. The Zhuangzi clearly identifies qi as the\nbasis of the physical constitution of the body: \u201cHuman birth is\ncaused by the gathering together of qi\u201d (22, 733,\nmisleadingly translated by Watson (2013, 180) as \u201cpurity\u201d).\nThe Zhuangzi also describes harmonizing or taking charge of\nthe six qi.\n\n\nThe qi of heaven is not in harmony, the qi of\nearth is tangled and snarled. The six qi are maladjusted, the\nfour seasons are disordered. Now I want to harmonize the essences\nof the six qi in order to nurture life (Zhuangzi 11, 386, emphasis\nadded, cf. Watson 2013, 80).\n\n\nSimilarly, the Springs and Autumns of Master L\u00fc\n(L\u00fcshi chunqiu) describes sages as making their numinous\nessences (jing shen \u7cbe\u795e) tranquil, and preserving\nand increasing their longevity (3.2, pp. 3b-4a, trans. Knoblock and\nRiegel 2000, 3/2.1, 99).\n\n\nIn all these texts a sage or numinous person achieves that status\nthrough both meta-physical and physical means. This is the focus of\nDaoist \u201cNurturing Life\u201d techniques (discussed in section\n2).\n\n\nWe find a different account of these concepts in technical\nworks. The apocryphal \u201cfounder\u201d of scientific thought\nin China was Zou Yan \u9112\u884d (305\u2013240 BCE), who is credited\nwith combining and systematizing yin-yang and wuxing\ntheory. No works attributed to him survive. Sima Qian\u2019s\nbiography in Shi ji 76 describes him as a member of the Jixia\n\u7a37\u4e0b Academy, originally from the state of Qi in present\nday Shandong (Needham 1956: 231\u201334). By contrast, the Han\nshu describes him as a Recipe Master (fang shi). \nThis is important because of the connection between fang shi\nand medicine.\n\nFang shi practiced medicine and divination and claimed to\npossess secret texts and formulae. They gained great influence during\nthe earlier part of the Han dynasty, though their influence waned by\nthe later Han. The fang shi used yin-yang and Five Agents cosmology.\nThey seem to have originated from the Shandong peninsula, and were\nparticularly associated with the mantic arts, including the use of the\nsexagenary cycle of stems and branches, the Yi jing, and\ndivination by stars, dreams, physiognomy, the winds, and by the use of\npitch pipes (Ngo 1976).\n",
