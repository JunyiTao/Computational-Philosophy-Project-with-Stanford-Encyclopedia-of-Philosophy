    "main_text": "The Comparative Approach || The Attitude Toward the Work of Art\n4. Conclusion\n\n\nThe subject, as he said in his opening line, is very big and entirely\nmisunderstood. It is very big in its scope\u2014in the reach of the\naesthetic dimension throughout human life.\n\n\nBut we can now, at the end of his lectures, see that it is a big\nsubject in other senses too: aesthetics is conceptually expansive in\nits important linkages to the philosophy of language, to the\nphilosophy of mind, to ethics, and to other areas of philosophy, and\nit resists encapsulation into a single, unifying problem. It is a\nmulti-faceted, multi-aspected human cultural phenomenon where\nconnections, of diverging kinds, are more in play than causal\nrelations. The form of explanation we find truly satisfying will thus\nstrikingly diverge from the form of explanation in science \u2013 the\nmodels of explanation in Naturwissenschaften are misapplied\nin Geisteswissenschaften, and the viewing of the latter\nthrough the lens of the former will yield reduction, exclusion, and\nultimately distortion. The humanities are thus, for Wittgenstein, in\nthis sense autonomous.\n\n\nAll of this, along with the impoverishing and blinding superimposition\nof conceptual models, templates, and pictures onto the extraordinarily\nrich world of aesthetic engagement, also now, at the end of his\nlectures, gives content to what Wittgenstein meant at the beginning\nwith the words \u201centirely misunderstood\u201d. For now, at this\nstage of Wittgenstein's development, where the complexity-accepting\nstance of the later Philosophical Investigations (1958) and\nother work is unearthing and uprooting the philosophical\npresuppositions of the simplification-seeking earlier work, examples\nthemselves have priority as indispensable instruments in the struggle\nto free ourselves of misconception in the aesthetic realm. And these\nexamples, given due and detailed attention, will exhibit a\ncontext-sensitive particularity that makes generalized pronouncements\nhovering high above the ground of that detail look otiose,\ninattentive, or, more bluntly, just a plain falsification of\nexperience. What remains is not, then\u2014and this is an idea\nWittgenstein's auditors must themselves have struggled with in those\nrooms in Cambridge, as many still do today\u2014another theory built\nupon now stronger foundations, but rather a clear view of our\nmultiform aesthetic practices. Wittgenstein, in his mature, later\nwork, did not generate a theory of language, of mind, or of\nmathematics. He generated, rather, a vast body of work perhaps united\nonly in its therapeutic and intricately labored search for conceptual\nclarification. One sees the same philosophical aspiration driving his\nforay into aesthetics.\n",
