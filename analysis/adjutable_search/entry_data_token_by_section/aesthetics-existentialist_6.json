Theory of expression\n\n\nThe emphasis on the capacity of human consciousness to\n\u2018derealise\u2019 the world amounts to a defence of the creative\nfreedom of the artist. The artwork is the most striking example of the\npower of human consciousness to turn towards the world in such a way\nthat it takes in from it certain elements and blanks out others, in\naccordance to a fundamental existential project. Artistic practice is\none of the most eminent demonstrations of human freedom because it\nshows how human practice can recreate (Camus, Sartre, de Beauvoir,\nMerleau-Ponty) or recover (Marcel) a new, more ordered world out of the\ngiven world. Camus offers a concise formulation for a central principle\nof existentialist aesthetics: \u201cTo write is already to\nchoose\u201d (Camus 1951, 271).\n\n\nThe existentialist philosophers did not refrain from formulating\ninternal (aesthetic) and external (ethical and political) constraints\nto artistic practice, but their aesthetics fundamentally proclaims the\nradical freedom of the artist, also seeing in it the privileged\nexemplar of human freedom in general. Camus, for example, makes\nartistic activity, the choice of becoming an artist, one of the\nprivileged modes for humans to deal with the absurd (Camus 1942b,\n86\u201388). Many existentialist texts dedicated to aesthetic matters\nemphasise the \u2018mystery\u2019 of creativity, the amazing\n\u2018solution\u2019 that an artwork represents, the \u2018miracle\nof expression\u2019 that elicits admiration from the audience and the\nphilosopher.\n\n\nBut radical freedom is ambiguous, as it must work with a\nfacticity (a term the existentialists adopted from Heidegger),\nviz., a set of given factors (physical, social and so on) that it has\nnot created. In the case of the artist, the ambiguity resides already\nin the decision and the passion to become an artist. Although a set of\ngenetic and social preconditions influences that decision, it is\nequally the product of an individual decision in that specific\nsituation.\n\n\nThe work of art is caught up in the same ambiguity. On the one hand,\nit is the free creation of an unconstrained person, a purely\nidiosyncratic expression of an individuality. On the other, it is\nconstrained by various factors that exert influence on its very\nstructure: the audience, the historical period that will receive the\nwork, the material elements that make up the artwork, and in\nparticular, the already signifying elements that the artist reuses and\nrecomposes to create a new work.\n\n\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s writings of the 1950s advance an original\nexistentialist theory of expression that addresses this latter\ndimension in particular. It can be argued that this theory of\nexpression captures and makes explicit thoughts that a number of other\nexistentialist writers shared on these questions.\n\n\nIn The Prose of the World (1964), Merleau-Ponty explored the emergence and logic of meaning and meaning-giving activity, of\nsignification and expression, using the example of literary works\n(particularly the novel). Stendhal provided him with a paradigmatic\ncase study. Such an attempt to draw deep philosophical conclusions from\nartworks is typical of existentialist practice.\n\n\nFirstly, the literary work can help us understand the phenomenon of\nmeaning and meaning-giving by seeing the writer as creating new\nmeanings, indeed a new language (a Joycean version of English, a\nFlaubertian French, and so on) by recomposing a language he or she\nshares with an entire historical community. This is a truly ambiguous\naspect that can be taken (on one hand) as the proof of the mystery of\nexpression, evidence of a creative power required to make possible the\nemergence of the new out of the old, while (on the other hand) this new\nis possible only on the basis of the already-instituted. But this\ninitial remark points to a much deeper level; here, it is painting that\noffers the most precious indications. In discussing Andr\u00e9\nMalraux\u2019s seminal essays on the history of painting (Malraux\n1953), Merleau-Ponty articulated a detailed existentialist theory of\nmeaning where the artwork plays the central role. The Husserlian\nmetaphor of \u2018perspective\u2019 is appropriated and transformed\ninto a general formula for both the power of perception and the\nmetaphysical condition of the human being.\n\n\nIntentionality can be said to coincide with the establishment of a\nperspective in a world where there is, prior to human presence, none.\nFor reality to appear in all its different qualities and structures,\nhuman consciousness is required. What distinguishes the artist from\nother language-users is the consistency and coherence of a specific\noutlook onto the world. Such coherent perspective introduces an element\nof regularity and structure in the chaos of the world. It introduces\ndirections: a high and a low, a right and a left. That is, it\nintroduces sense.\n\n\nThis link between artistic expression and meaning leads to a major\nre-evaluation of the notion of style. Rather than a superficial way of\nformulating meanings that remain unchanged by their expression, style\nin this context now indicates a fundamental perspective from which the\nworld can be approached; it indicates a perspective that would not have\nexisted prior to the expressive act. It designates an\n\u201cirreplaceable deviation\u201d that is possible only from a\nspecific way of being-in-the-world, and which is subsequently\nrecaptured in symbolic language, whether the linguistic form of\nliterature, or the \u201cindirect language\u201d of painting. Style\nis a coherent perspective, a \u201ccoherent deformation,\u201d a way\nof being-in-the-world and of approaching the world from a certain\nangle. On this model, style does not express pre-existing meaning, but\ncreates it. Camus, in the pages of The Rebel devoted to the\naesthetic dimensions of rebellion, developed a concomitant conception\nof artistic expression:\n\n\n\u2026 unity in art appears at the limit of the transformation\nwhich the artist imposes on reality. This correction, which the artist\nimposes by his language and by a redistribution of the elements\nextracted from reality, is called style and gives the recreated\nuniverse its unity and its boundaries (Camus 1951, 270).\n\n\nThis in turn gives a more specific meaning to the relation of the\nnew and the old in expression. True expression (whether the first\ngenuine self-expression of the learning speaker, a new scientific\nmeaning, or true artistic achievement) is both totally idiosyncratic,\nand a re-composition of shared elements; it transforms the old. For\ntrue expression to occur, two forms of speech are thus required:\n\u201cspeaking speech\u201d and \u201cspoken speech\u201d\n(Merleau-Ponty, 1945a, 197). This explains the puzzling fact that a\ntrue expression must be at once a true creation, something unheard of,\nand yet can be understood only if the language it uses (natural,\nscientific or artistic) is known. In other words, expression is always\nalso a form of communication between one \u201cspeaker\u201d and the\ncommunity of speakers. Assuming that Merleau-Ponty\u2019s analyses are\nrepresentative of views that were shared by the other existentialist\nwriters (see Sartre, 1948a, 56, in which the germane concept of\n\u201cmediation\u201d is used; \u201ccommunication\u201d is the\ncentral notion in Marcel\u2019s philosophy of theatre), we can note\nthat once again existentialist aesthetics seems at odds with many\nmodern artistic currents, which have insisted on drawing a radical\ndistinction between the functions and uses of artistic and everyday\nlanguages. For example, a major poet and theorist of literature like\nPaul Val\u00e9ry was inspired by Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s famous\ncharacterisation of poetry as \u201cgiving a purer sense to the words\nof the tribe.\u201d We can also mention surrealist and expressionist\npainters and film directors who sought to break through everyday\nimagery in order to transfigure reality.\n\n\nArtistic communication also has a certain capacity to transcend the\nages and cut across languages. Beyond the historical situatedness of\nartistic communication (the fact that an artistic language re-uses the\nlanguage of its contemporaries), the task of giving sense on the basis\nof being-in-the-world is part of the metaphysical condition of being\nhuman, and so applicable to all humans throughout history. As a result,\nconsidering that art is a \u2018higher degree\u2019 of communication,\nthe work of art is not just a striking example of genuine expression,\nbut also exemplifies the fact that every act of meaning is open to the\npast and the future of other human acts of expression.\n\n\nAt this point, we can note a tension within the aesthetics of many\nexistentialist writers (a tension that is quite acute in Sartre\u2019s\nwork) between the relative trans-historical meaningfulness of artworks\nand their utter situatedness: artworks offer an image of\nengaged freedom in particular situations that are truly accessible only\nto its contemporaries (Sartre 1948a, 50\u201352). Merleau-Ponty, for his\npart, insists on the underlying unity of the history of painting, which\nallows us to find traces and echoes of past painters in modern ones.\nThe history of painting is a microcosmic image of history, and a\ntestament to the capacity of present generations to understand the\nactions and passions of the past (Merleau-Ponty 1964b, 72).\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s vision of the possibility of empathy across the\nages does not deny the historical relativity of sense formations. It\nshows how, despite the spatiotemporal distance that separates\nhistorical contexts, humans can still understand each other, historians\ncan understand previous times, anthropologists other peoples, and we\ncan somehow access some of the meanings of past artistic practices. The\nexpressive achievements of other peoples are both radically alien, and\nyet the result of expressive gestures that are commensurable to ours,\ninasmuch as they are the product of a common human capacity, viz., the\ncapacity to transcend the natural world and recreate it as a meaningful\nand ordered universe.\n",
