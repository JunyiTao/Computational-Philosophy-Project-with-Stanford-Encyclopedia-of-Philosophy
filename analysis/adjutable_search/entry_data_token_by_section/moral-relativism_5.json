Metaethical Moral Relativism\n\nEven if it were established that there are deep and widespread moral\ndisagreements that cannot be rationally resolved, and that these\ndisagreements are more significant than whatever agreements there may\nbe, it would not immediately follow that MMR is correct.\nOther nonobjectivist conclusions might be drawn. In particular,\nopponents of objectivism might argue for moral skepticism, that we\ncannot know moral truths, or for a view that moral judgments lack\ntruth-value (understood to imply a rejection of relative truth-value).\nHence, proponents of MMR face two very different groups of\ncritics: assorted kinds of moral objectivists and various sorts of\nmoral nonobjectivists. The defender of MMR needs to establish\nthat MMR is superior to all these positions, and this would\nrequire a comparative assessment of their respective advantages and\ndisadvantages. It is beyond the scope of this article to consider the\nalternative positions (see the entries on\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism,\n moral anti-realism,\n moral epistemology,\n moral realism, and\n moral skepticism).\n What can be considered are the challenges the proponent of\nMMR faces and what may be said in response to them. Some\ncritics of MMR have raised questions about the coherence of\nthe position (for example, Boghossian 2011 and 2017).\n\nFor example, it might be thought that MMR, with respect to\ntruth-value, would have the result that a moral judgment such as\n\u201csuicide is morally right\u201d (S) could be both true and\nfalse\u2014true when valid for one group and false when invalid for\nanother. But this appears to be an untenable position: most people\nwould grant that nothing can be both true and false. Of course, some\npersons could be justified in affirming S and other persons justified\nin denying it, since the two groups could have different evidence. But\nit is another matter to say S is both true and false.\n\nA standard relativist response is to say that moral truth is relative\nin some sense. On this view, S is not true or false\nabsolutely speaking, but it may be true-relative-to-X and\nfalse-relative-to-Y (where X and Y refer to\nthe moral codes of different societies). This means that suicide is\nright for persons in a society governed by X, but it is not\nright for persons in a society governed by Y; and, the\nrelativist may contend, there is no inconsistency in this conjunction\nproperly understood.\n\nIt might be objected that the notion of relative truth fails to\ncapture the sense in which \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018wrong\u2019\nare normative terms about what ought to be as opposed to what is the\ncase. The statement \u201csuicide is morally right\u201d is\nnormative in this sense, but the statement \u201csuicide is morally\nright for persons in a society governed by moral code X\u201d is not\nnormative, but descriptive: it tells us what persons who accept moral\ncode X think, and as such it is something everyone could agree with,\nirrespective of their own moral code, if in fact this is what moral\ncode X says. In response, it might be said that there are expressions\nof relativist moral statements that are normative. For instance,\n\u201csuicide is morally right for us,\u201d spoken by and to\nmembers of the group referred to by \u2018us\u2019, is not merely a\ndescription of what they believe: it tells them what they are morally\npermitted to do (in this sense, it is action-guiding).\n\nSuch relativist formulations may also give rise to a related and very\ncommon objection. Relativism often presents itself as an\ninterpretation of moral disagreements: It is said to be the best\nexplanation of rationally irresolvable or faultless moral\ndisagreements. However, once moral truth is regarded as relative, the\ndisagreements seem to disappear. For example, someone accepting\nX who affirms S is saying suicide is right for\npersons accepting X, while someone accepting Y who\ndenies S is saying suicide is not right for persons accepting\nY. It might well be that they are both correct and hence that\nthey are not disagreeing with one another (rather as two people in\ndifferent places might both be correct when one says the sun is\nshining and the other says it is not, or as two people in different\ncountries may both be correct when one says something is illegal and\nthe other says it is not). The relativist explanation dissolves the\ndisagreement. But, then, why did it appear as a disagreement in the\nfirst place? An objectivist might say this is because people thinking\nthis assume that moral truth is absolute rather than relative. If this\nwere correct, the relativist could not maintain that MMR\ncaptures what people already believe. The contention would have to be\nthat they should believe it, and the argument for relativism would\nhave to be formulated in those terms. For example, the relativist\nmight contend that MMR is the most plausible position to\nadopt insofar as moral judgments often give practically conflicting\ndirectives and neither judgment can be shown to be rationally superior\nto the other.\n\nAnother common objection, though probably more so outside philosophy\nthan within it, is that MMR cannot account for the fact that\nsome practices such as the holocaust in Germany or slavery in the\nUnited States are obviously objectively wrong. This point is usually\nexpressed in a tone of outrage, often with the suggestion that\nrelativists pose a threat to civilized society (or something of this\nsort). Proponents of MMR might respond that this simply begs\nthe question, and in one sense they are right. However, this objection\nmight reflect a more sophisticated epistemology, for example, that we\nhave more reason to accept these objectivist intuitions than we have\nto accept any argument put forward in favor of MMR. This\nwould bring us back to the arguments of the last section. Another\nrelativist response would be to say that the practices in question,\nthough widely accepted, were wrong according to the fundamental\nstandards of the societies (for example, there were arguments against\nslavery presented in the United States prior to the Civil War). This\nwould not show that the practices are objectively wrong, but it might\nmitigate the force of the critique. However, though this response may\nbe plausible in some cases, it is not obvious that it always would be\nconvincing.\n\nThis last response brings out the fact that a proponent of\nMMR needs a clear specification of that to which truth is\nrelative. For example, if S is true-relative-to the moral\ncode of a society, does this mean it is true-relative-to what people\nin the society think the moral code says or to what the fundamental\nstandards of the moral code actually imply? These might not be the\nsame. It is often supposed that truths can be undiscovered or that\npeople can make mistakes about them. As just noted, a moral relativist\ncould make sense of this by supposing that it is the fundamental\nstandards of a moral code that are authoritative for people in a\nsociety that accepts that code. Hence, what is morally\ntrue-relative-to the moral code of a society is whatever the\nfundamental standards of the code would actually warrant. By this\ncriterion, there could be moral truths that are unknown to people in\nthe society that accepts the code, or these people could be mistaken\nin thinking something is a moral truth.\n\nA similar point arises from the fact that it is sometimes thought to\nbe an advantage of MMR that it maintains a substantial notion\nof intersubjective truth or justification: It avoids the defects of\nmoral objectivism, on the one hand, and of moral skepticism and\ntheories that disregard moral truth-value altogether, on the other\nhand, because it maintains that moral judgments do not have truth in\nan absolute sense, but they do have truth relative to the moral code\nof a society (and similarly for justification). This is thought to be\nan advantage because, notwithstanding the supposed difficulties with\nmoral objectivism, morality is widely regarded as \u201cnot merely\nsubjective,\u201d and MMR can capture this. However, this\npurported advantage raises an important question for relativism: Why\nsuppose moral judgments have truth-value relative to a society as\nopposed to no truth-value at all? If the relativist claims that a set\nof fundamental standards is authoritative for persons in a society, it\nmay be asked why they have this authority. This question may arise in\nquite practical ways. For example, suppose a dissident challenges some\nof the fundamental standards of his or her society. Is this person\nnecessarily wrong?\n\nVarious answers may be given to these questions. For example, it may\nbe said that the standards that are authoritative in a society are\nthose that reasonable and well-informed members of the society would\ngenerally accept. This might seem to provide a basis for normative\nauthority. However, if this approach were taken, it may be asked why\nthat authority rests only on reasonable and well-informed members of\nthe society. Why not a wider group? Why not all reasonable and\nwell-informed persons?\n\nA different response would be to say that the standards that are\nauthoritative for a society are the ones persons have agreed to follow\nas a result of some negotiation or bargaining process (as seen above,\nHarman has argued that we should understand some moral judgments in\nthese terms). Once again, this might seem to lend those standards some\nauthority. Still, it may be asked whether they really have authority\nor perhaps whether they have the right kind. For example, suppose the\nagreement had been reached in circumstances in which a few members of\nsociety held great power over the others (in the real world, the most\nlikely scenario). Those with less power might have been prudent to\nmake the agreement, but it is not obvious that such an agreement would\ncreate genuine normative authority\u2014a point the dissident\nchallenging the standards might well make. Moreover, if all moral\nvalues are understood in this way, how do we explain the authority of\nthe contention that people should follow a set of values because they\nagreed to do so? Must there be a prior agreement to do what we agree\nto do?\n\nA related objection concerns the specification of the society to which\nmoral justification or truth are said to be relative. People typically\nbelong to many different groups defined by various criteria: culture,\nreligion, political territory, ethnicity, race, gender, etc. Moreover,\nwhile it is sometimes claimed that the values of a group defined by\none of these criteria have authority for members of the group, such\nclaims are often challenged. The specification of the relevant group\nis itself a morally significant question, and there appears to be no\nobjective map of the world that displays its division into social\ngroups to which the truth or justification of moral judgments are\nrelative. A proponent of MMR needs a plausible way of\nidentifying the group of persons to which moral truth or justification\nare relative.\n\nMoreover, not only do people typically belong to more than one group,\nas defined by the aforementioned criteria, the values that are\nauthoritative in each group a person belongs to may not always be the\nsame. If I belong to a religion and a nationality, and their values\nconcerning abortion are diametrically opposed, then which value is\ncorrect for me? This raises the question whether there is a basis for\nresolving the conflict consistent with MMR (the two groups\nmight have conflicting fundamental standards) and whether in this\ncircumstance MMR would entail that there is a genuine moral\ndilemma (meaning that abortion is both right and wrong for me). This\npoint is not necessarily an objection, but a defender of MMR\nwould have to confront these issues and develop a convincing position\nconcerning them.\n\nThe fact that social groups are defined by different criteria, and\nthat persons commonly belong to more than one social group, might be\ntaken as a reason to move from relativism to a form of subjectivism.\nThat is, instead of saying that the truth or justification of moral\njudgments is relative to a group, we should say it is relative to each\nindividual (as noted above, relativism is sometimes defined to include\nboth positions). This revision might defuse the issues just discussed,\nbut it would abandon the notion of intersubjectivity with respect to\ntruth or justification\u2014what for many proponents of MMR\nis a chief advantage of the position. Moreover, a proponent of this\nsubjectivist account would need to explain in what sense, if any,\nmoral values have normative authority for a person as opposed to\nsimply being accepted. The fact that we sometimes think our moral\nvalues have been mistaken is often thought to imply that we believe\nthey have some authority that does not consist in the mere fact that\nwe accept them.\n\nAnother set of concerns arises from purported facts about similarities\namong and interactions across different societies vis-\u00e0-vis\nmorality. People in one society sometimes make moral judgments about\npeople in another society on the basis of moral standards they take to\nbe authoritative for both societies. In addition, conflicts between\nsocieties are sometimes resolved because one society changes its moral\noutlook and comes to share at least some of the moral values of the\nother society. More generally, sometimes people in one society think\nthey learn from the moral values of another society: They come to\nbelieve that the moral values of another society are better in some\nrespects than their own (previously accepted) values. The Mondrian\nimage of a world divided into distinct societies, each with it own\ndistinctive moral values, makes it difficult to account for these\nconsiderations. If this image is abandoned as unrealistic, and is\nreplaced by one that acknowledges greater moral overlap and\ninteraction among societies (recall the Pollock image), then the\nproponent of MMR needs to give a plausible account of these\ndynamics. This is related to the problem of authority raised earlier:\nThese considerations suggest that people sometimes acknowledge moral\nauthority that extends beyond their own society, and a relativist\nneeds to show why this makes sense or why people are mistaken in this\nacknowledgement.\n",
