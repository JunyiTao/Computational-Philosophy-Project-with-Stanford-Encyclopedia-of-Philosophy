    "main_text": "Punishment, Crime, and the State\n2. Punishment, Crime, and the State\n\nLegal punishment presupposes crime as that for which punishment is\nimposed, and a criminal law as that which defines crimes as crimes; a\nsystem of criminal law presupposes a state, which has the political\nauthority to make and enforce the law and to impose punishments. A\nnormative account of legal punishment and its justification must thus\nat least presuppose, and should perhaps make explicit, a normative\naccount of the criminal law (why should we have a criminal law at\nall?) and of the proper powers and functions of the state (by what\nauthority or right does the state make and declare law, and impose\npunishments on those who break it?). (See generally Duff 2018: ch.\n1.)\n\nRecent scholarship has thus seen a growing interest in grounding\nanalysis of the justification of punishment in a political theory of\nthe state. Many of these accounts are based on Rawls\u2019s political\ntheory or on other versions of constructivism (see Matravers 2000 and\n2011b; Dolovich 2004; Brettschneider 2007; Flanders 2017; for\ncritiques of such accounts, see Garvey 2004, Dagger 2011b). Several\nothers are based on versions of republicanism (see Pettit 1997; Duff\n2001; Dagger 2007 and 2011a; Yankah 2015; for other recent\ncontributions showing the importance of political theory, see Brudner\n2009; Brooks 2011; Sigler 2011; Markel 2012; Chiao 2016 and 2018). How\nfar it matters, in this context, to make explicit a political theory\nof the state depends on how far different plausible political theories\nwill generate different accounts of how punishment can be justified\nand should be used. We cannot pursue this question here (for two\nsharply contrasting views on it, see Philips 1986; M. Davis 1989),\nsave to note one central point. For any political theory that takes\nseriously the idea of citizenship as full membership of the polity,\nthe problem of punishment takes a particularly acute form, since we\nhave now to ask how punishment can be consistent with citizenship (how\ncitizens can legitimately punish each other): if we are not to say\nthat those who commit crimes thereby forfeit their status as citizens\n(see s. 6 below), we must \u2014 if we are to justify punishment at\nall \u2014 show how the imposition of punishment can be consistent\nwith, or even expressive of, the respect that citizens owe to each\nother. (Punishment is also, of course, imposed on non-citizens who\ncommit crimes within a state\u2019s territory: on the primacy of\ncitizenship in understanding criminal law and its authority, and on\nthe status of non-citizens, see Duff 2013 and 2018: ch. 3; Wringe\n2021.)\n\nBefore we tackle such theories of punishment, however, we should look\nbriefly at the concept of crime, since that is one focus of the\nabolitionist critique of punishment.\n\nOn a simple positivist view of law, crimes are kinds of conduct that\nare prohibited, on pain of threatened sanctions, by the law; and for\npositivists such as Bentham, who combine positivism with a normative\nconsequentialism, the questions of whether we should maintain a\ncriminal law at all, and of what kinds of conduct should be\ncriminalised, are to be answered by trying to determine whether and\nwhen this method of controlling human conduct is likely to produce a\nnet increase in good. Such a perspective seems inadequate, however:\ninadequate both to the claims of the criminal law, which presents its\ndemands as something other or more than those of a gunman writ large\n\u2014 as something other or more than \u2018Behave thus, or\nelse!\u2019 \u2014 and to the normative issues at stake when we ask\nwhat kinds of conduct should be criminalised. For the criminal law\nportrays crime not merely as conduct which has been prohibited, but as\na species of wrongdoing: whether our inquiry is analytical (into the\nconcept of crime) or normative (as to what kinds of conduct, if any,\nshould be criminal), we must therefore focus on that notion of\nwrongdoing.\n\nCrimes are, at least, socially proscribed wrongs \u2014 kinds of\nconduct that are condemned as wrong by some purportedly authoritative\nsocial norm. That is to say that they are wrongs which are not merely\n\u2018private\u2019 affairs, which properly concern only those\ndirectly involved in them: the community as a whole \u2014 in this\ncase, the political community speaking through the law \u2014 claims\nthe right to declare them to be wrongs. But crimes are\n\u2018public\u2019 wrongs in a sense that goes beyond this. Tort\nlaw, for instance, deals in part with wrongs that are non-private in\nthat they are legally and socially declared as wrongs \u2014 with the\nwrong constituted by libel, for instance. But they are still treated\nas \u2018private\u2019 wrongs in the sense that it is up to the\nperson who was wronged to seek legal redress. She must decide to\nbring, or not to bring, a civil case against the person who wronged\nher; and although she can appeal to the law to protect her rights, the\ncase is still between her and the defendant. By contrast, a criminal\ncase is between the whole political community \u2014 the state or the\npeople \u2014 and the defendant: the wrong is \u2018public\u2019 in\nthe sense that it is one for which the wrongdoer must answer not just\nto the individual victim, but to the whole polity through its criminal\ncourts.\n\nIt is notoriously difficult to give a clear and plausible account of\nthe distinction between civil and criminal law, between\n\u2018private\u2019 and \u2018public\u2019 legal wrongs, whether\nour interest is in the analytical question of what the distinction\namounts to, or in the normative question of which kinds of wrong\nshould fall into which category (see Murphy and Coleman 1984: ch. 3; a\nsymposium in Boston University Law Review vol. 76 (1996):\n1\u2013373; Lamond 2007). It might be tempting to say that crimes are\n\u2018public\u2019 wrongs in the sense that they injure the whole\ncommunity: they threaten social order, for instance, or cause\n\u2018social volatility\u2019 (Becker 1974); or they involve taking\nunfair advantage over those who obey the law (H. Morris 1968:\n477\u201380; Murphy 1973; Dagger 1993 and 2008); or they undermine\nthe trust on which social life depends (Dimock 1997). But such\naccounts distract our attention from the wrongs done to the individual\nvictims that most crimes have, when it is those wrongs that should be\nour central concern: we should condemn the rapist or murderer, we\nshould see the wrong he has done as our concern, because of what he\nhas done to his victim. Another suggestion is that\n\u2018public\u2019 wrongs are those that flout the community\u2019s\nessential or most basic values, in which all members of the community\nshould see themselves as sharing: the wrong is done to\n\u2018us\u2019, not merely to its individual victim, in the sense\nthat we identify ourselves with the victim as a fellow citizen (see\nMarshall and Duff 1998; Duff 2007: ch. 6; and see further section 6 of\nthe entry on\n theories of criminal law).\n\nSome abolitionists, however, argue that we should seek to eliminate\nthe concept of crime from our social vocabulary: we should talk and\nthink not of \u2018crimes\u2019, but of \u2018conflicts\u2019 or\n\u2018troubles\u2019 (Christie 1977; Hulsman 1986). One motivation\nfor this might be the thought that \u2018crime\u2019 entails\npunishment as the appropriate response: but that is not so, since we\ncould imagine a system of criminal law without punishment. To define\nsomething as a \u2018crime\u2019 does indeed imply that some kind of\npublic response is appropriate, since it is to define it as a kind of\nwrong that properly concerns the whole community; and it implies that\nthat response should be a condemnatory one, since to identify wrongs\nas wrongs is to mark them out as apt for condemnation: but that\npublic, condemnatory response could consist in nothing more than, for\ninstance, some version of a criminal trial which calls the alleged\nwrongdoer to answer for her alleged wrongdoing, and condemns her for\nit, through a criminal conviction, if she is proved guilty. One can of\ncourse count a criminal conviction as a kind of punishment: but it\ndoes not entail the kind of materially burdensome punishment, imposed\nafter conviction, with which penal theorists are primarily\nconcerned.\n\nAnother possible motivation for the abolitionist objection to the\nconcept of crime is a kind of moral relativism that objects to the\n\u2018imposition\u2019 of values on those who might not share them\n(Bianchi 1994: 71\u201397): but since abolitionists are very ready to\ntell us, insistently, how we ought to respond to conflicts or\ntroubles, and how a state ought or ought not to treat its citizens,\nsuch an appeal to relativism reflects serious confusion (see Williams\n1976: 34\u201339). More plausibly, the abolitionist claim could be\nthat rather than take wrongdoing as our focus, we should focus on the\nharm that has been done, and on how it can be repaired; we will return\nto this suggestion in section 7 below.\n\nAnother abolitionist concern is that by defining and treating conduct\nas \u2018criminal\u2019, the law \u2018steals\u2019 the conflicts\nwhich crime involves from those to whom they properly belong (Christie\n1977): instead of allowing, and helping, those who find themselves in\nconflict to resolve their trouble, the law takes the matter over and\ntranslates it into the professionalised context of the criminal\njustice system, in which neither \u2018victim\u2019 nor\n\u2018offender\u2019 is allowed any appropriate or productive role.\nNow it is a familiar and disturbing truth that our existing criminal\nprocesses \u2014 both in their structure and in their actual\noperations \u2014 tend to preclude any effective participation by\neither victims or offenders, although an adequate response to the\ncriminal wrong that was done should surely involve them both. One\nresponse is to argue, as some abolitionists do, that our response to\ncrime should consist not in punishment, but in a process of mediation\nor \u2018restoration\u2019 between victim and offender (see s. 7\nbelow); but another is to insist that we should retain a distinctive\ncriminal process of trials, and punishment, in which the polity as a\nwhole, acting on behalf of the victim as well as on its own behalf,\ncalls the criminal wrongdoer to account \u2014 but that victims and\noffenders should be given a more active role in that process (see\nfurther Duff et al 2007, esp. chs. 3\u20135, 7). Such an insistence\non the need for a public criminal process reflects two aspects of the\nconcept of crime: first, it is sometimes important to recognise that a\nsituation involves not just people in \u2018conflict\u2019, but a\nvictim who has been wronged and an offender who has done the wrong;\nsecond, some such wrongs are \u2018public\u2019 wrongs in the sense\nsketched above \u2014 wrongs that properly concern not just those\ndirectly affected, but all members of the political community. Faced,\nfor instance, by feuding neighbours who persistently accuse each other\nof more or less trivial wrongs, it might indeed be appropriate to\nsuggest that they should forget about condemning each other and look\nfor a way of resolving their conflict. But faced by a rapist and the\nperson he raped, or by a violent husband and the wife he has been\nbeating up, it would a betrayal both of the victim and of the values\nto which we are supposedly committed to portray the situation merely\nas a \u2018conflict\u2019 which the parties should seek to resolve:\nwhatever else or more we can do, we must recognise and declare that\nhere is a victim who has been seriously wronged; and we must be\ncollectively ready to censure the offender\u2019s action as a wrong\n(for a useful discussion of the significance of criminal law in the\ncontext of domestic violence, see Dempsey 2009).\n\nHowever, to argue that we should retain the concept of crime, that we\nshould maintain a criminal law which defines and condemns a category\nof \u2018public\u2019 wrongs, is not yet to say that we should\nmaintain a penal system that punishes those who commit such wrongs;\nwhile a system of criminal law might require something like a system\nof criminal trials that will authoritatively identify and condemn\ncriminal wrongdoers, it does not of its nature require the imposition\nof further sanctions on such wrongdoers. So, we must turn now to the\nquestion of what could justify such a system of punishment.\n",
