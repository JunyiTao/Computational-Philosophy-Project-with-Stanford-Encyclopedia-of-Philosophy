The Fabric of Moral Being\n\n(B) Beyond her expansion of moral agency to include inner mental life,\nMurdoch proposes the notion of a person\u2019s total moral being,\nwhich transcends agency itself. In discussing M she says that\nher inner mental acts of attention contribute to \u201ca continuous\nfabric of being\u201d (IP: 22/316) that she says \n\n\nis shown in their mode of speech or silence, their choice of words,\ntheir assessment of others, their conception of their own life, what\nthey think attractive or praiseworthy, what they think funny. (VCM\n1956/EM: 80f) \n\n\nIn discussing the fabric of being idea, Diamond refers to\n\u201cthoughts, jokes, patterns of attention, fantasies, imaginative\nexplorations, and a thousand other things\u201d (Diamond 2010: 72.\nSee also Crary 2007: 47). In Metaphysics Murdoch says\n\u201cMorality is and ought to be connected with the whole of our\nbeing\u201d. (MGM 1992: 495).\n\nMurdoch is saying that our thoughts, modes of speech, emotions,\nimaginings, contemplatings, and the like, are responses to our\nperceived reality, just as the exercise of moral agency is. If we are\namused by someone making fun of a disabled person, that is part of our\nmoral being; it reflects on us morally. Such responses are part of us,\nbut are not always doings, exercisings of agency.\n\nThis metaphor of the fabric of being connects with Murdoch\u2019s\nsaying that morality is \n\n\nsomething that goes on continually, not something that is switched off\nin between the occurrence of explicit moral choices. (IP: 37/329) \n\n\na key criticism of\n point 4\n (morality consists fundamentally in choice-making in specifiable\nsituations). We are in a constant state of moral formation,\nand we bring our fabric of being to (what we experience as) choice\nsituations. Actions and other responses flow from the background\nfabric of being that has been constructed by this moral formation.\nThis metaphor also connects with Murdoch\u2019s defense of the moral\nimportance of the inner life, of the individual\u2019s consciousness,\nthat is ignored or demoted in the moral philosophy of her time\n (point 5),\n a development she thinks due partly to a partial misunderstanding of\nWittgenstein\u2019s emphasis on public criteria for the meaning of\nconcepts (IP 1970, e.g., 15/311; Wiseman 2020).\n",
