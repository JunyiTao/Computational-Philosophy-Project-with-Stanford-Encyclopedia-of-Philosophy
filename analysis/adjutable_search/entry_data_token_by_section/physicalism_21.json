    "main_text": "The Case Against Physicalism || Methodological Issues\n5.4 Methodological Issues\n\nThe final argument I will consider against physicalism is of a more\nmethodological nature. It is sometimes suggested, not that physicalism\nis false, but that the entire \u2018project of physicalism\u2019\n\u2014 the project in philosophy of mind of debating whether\nphysicalism is true, and trying to establish or disprove its truth by\nphilosophical argument \u2014 is misguided. This sort of argument has\nbeen mounted by a number of writers, but perhaps its most vocal\nadvocate has been Noam Chomsky (2000; see also Searle 1992, 1999).\n\n\nIt is easiest to state Chomsky\u2019s criticism by beginning with two\npoints about methodological naturalism. In general it seems rational\nto agree with the methodological naturalists that the best hope for a\ntheoretical understanding of the world is by pursuing the methods\nwhich are typical of the sciences. It would then seem rational as a\nspecial case that our best hope for a theoretical understanding of\nconsciousness or experience is by pursuing the methods of the sciences\n\u2014 by pursuing, as we might put it, the naturalistic project with\nrespect to consciousness. So Chomsky\u2019s first point is that it is\nrational to pursue the naturalistic project with respect to\nconsciousness.\n\nChomsky\u2019s second point is that the physicalist project in\nphilosophy of mind is on the face of it rather different from the\nnaturalistic project. In the first place, the physicalist project is,\nas we have noted, usually thought of a piece of metaphysics. But there\nis nothing obviously metaphysical about the naturalistic project, it\nsimply raises questions about what we can hope to explain. In the\nsecond place, the physicalist project is normally thought of as being\namenable to philosophical argument, whereas it is unclear where\nphilosophical argument (if this is different from scientific argument)\nwould enter the naturalistic project. In short, there doesn\u2019t\nseem anything particularly \u2018philosophical\u2019 about the\nnaturalistic project \u2014 it simply applies the methods of science\nto consciousness. But the physicalist project is central to analytic\nphilosophy.\n\nIt is precisely at the place where the physicalist project departs\nfrom the naturalistic project that Chomsky\u2019s criticism begins to\ntake shape. For insofar as it is different from the naturalistic\nproject, there are a number of ways in which the physicalist project\nis questionable. First, it is hard to see what the project might be\n\u2014 it is true that throughout the history of philosophy and\nscience one encounters suggestions that one might find out about the\nworld in ways that are distinct from the ones used in the sciences,\nbut these suggestions have always been rather obscure. Second, it is\nhard to see how this sort of project could recommend itself to\nphysicalists themselves \u2014 such a project seems to be a\ndeparture from methodological naturalism but most physicalists endorse\nmethodological naturalism as a matter of fact. On the other hand, if\nthe physicalist project does not depart from the naturalistic project,\nthen the usual ways of talking and thinking about that project are\nhighly misleading. For example, it is misleading to speak of it as a\npiece of metaphysics as opposed to a piece of ordinary science.\n\nIn sum, Chomsky\u2019s criticism is best understood as a kind of\ndilemma. The physicalist project is either identical to the\nnaturalistic project or it is not. If it is identical, then the\nlanguage and concepts that shape the project are potentially extremely\nmisleading; but if it is not identical, then there are a number of\nways in which it is illegitimate.\n\nHow is one to respond to this criticism? In my view, the strongest\nanswer to Chomsky accepts the first horn of his dilemma and suggests\nthat what philosophers of mind are really concerned with is the\nnaturalistic project. Now, of course, what concerns them is not so\nmuch the details of the project \u2014 that would not distinguish\nthem from working scientists. Rather they are concerned with what the\nnature of the project and what its potential limits might be.\n\nThis theme might be developed in several ways, but one well-known\ndevelopment of it has been suggested by Thomas Nagel (1983) and\nBernard Williams (1985). According to them, any form of scientific\ninquiry will at least be objective, or will result in an objective\npicture of the world. On the other hand, we have a number of arguments\n\u2014 the most prominent being the knowledge argument \u2014 which\nplausibly show that there is no place for experience or qualia in a\nworld that is described in purely objective terms. If Nagel and\nWilliams are right that any form of scientific inquiry will yield a\ndescription of the world in objective terms, the knowledge argument is\nnothing less than a negative argument to the effect that the\nnaturalistic project with respect to consciousness will not\nsucceed.\n\nIf what is at issue is the limits of the naturalist project, why is\nthe debate so often construed as a metaphysical debate rather than a\ndebate about the limits of inquiry? In answer to this question, we\nneed to sharply divorce the background metaphysical framework within\nwhich the problems of philosophy of mind find their expression, and\nthe problems themselves. Physicalism is the background metaphysical\nassumption against which the problems of philosophy of mind are posed\nand discussed. Given that assumption, the question of the limits of\nthe naturalistic project just is the question of whether\nthere can be experience in a world that is totally physical.\nNevertheless, when properly understood, the problems that philosophers\nof mind are interested in are not with the framework themselves, and\nto that extent are not metaphysical. Thus, the common phrase\n\u2018metaphysics of mind\u2019 is misleading.\n",
