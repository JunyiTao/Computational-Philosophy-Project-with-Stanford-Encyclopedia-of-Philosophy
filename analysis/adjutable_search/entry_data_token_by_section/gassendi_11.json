Recent Commentary on Gassendi\n\n\nThe precise place of Gassendi in the history of early modern\nphilosophy and science is only partly articulated by recent\nscholarship, which has tended to focus on one aspect or another of his\nthought, and to portray Gassendi primarily as an opponent of one or\nanother contemporary, to the neglect of his positive theses. The\nlaudable goal of such contextualist studies is to demonstrate his key\nrole in important debates of the era, yet the picture that emerges\nfrom deliberation on these commentaries is rather Gassendi's relative\neclipse by other figures, notably Descartes. For example, one\nhistorical approach (Brundell, 1987) highlights a strong\nanti-Aristotelian strain which guides Gassendi's earlier criticisms of\nthe Scholastics as well as his later Epicurean works.  From this\nperspective, Gassendi may be seen as fighting the same battles as\nDescartes, and losing in any such comparison because he engages his\nfoes with generally lesser flash and apparently less sophisticated, or\nat least less novel, weaponry. Another common approach (Joy, 1987;\nDarmon, 1998; Mazauric, 1998; Taussig, 2001 and 2003) is to emphasize\nhistoricist and rhetorical elements of Gassendi's method, as employed\nin his conversations and correspondence with members of the Mersenne\ncircle. Gassendi's role in that context was by no means marginal, and\nit is impossible to downplay the centrality of that circle in early\nmodern scientific debate. Yet the most important figure to this group\nwas not actually an active participant in it, and this was\nDescartes. Mersenne, of course, is the other core personality in this\ncontext, and so Gassendi by default is at best a third. Gassendi\nperhaps fares worst in comparison with Descartes in recent discussions\nof their direct conflict over the Meditations, where\nGassendi's anti-Cartesian views are presented as a prism through which\nwe may best perceive the spectrum of his views (Osler 1994, Lennon\n1993, Grene and Ariew 1995). There is undoubtedly a case to be made\nthat he represents the most prominent alternative to Descartes in his\ntimes. However, highlighting this story encourages the view that\nGassendi deserves no more than footnote status and emphasizes, at\nleast historically speaking, his role as the losing\nalternative.\n\n\nAnother fashion has it that Gassendi's doctrinal beliefs form the\nfoundation of, or otherwise influence, his philosophical and\nscientific views. One such perspective suggests that his spiritual\nconcerns and materialist ontology jointly shape the character of his\nmetaphysics\u2014leading to irresolvable internal conflict (Bloch\n1971, Sortais 1922). Another perspective has it that his theological\nviews, and specifically his voluntarism, lead him to his empiricism\n(Osler 1994, Sarasohn 1996). But it is not clear that Gassendi is best\nunderstood as laboring in service of a doctrinal credo, or as\nmotivating his philosophical views by appeal to his theological\nsensibility. He indeed tailors his Epicurean views to meet theological\nconstraints and endorses the only astronomical world-view he believes\nacceptable to the Church, that of Tycho Brahe. Yet Gassendi's\ndefinitive criterion for any physical, metaphysical, or\nepistemological thesis is approximation to the truth, which is\nempirically-determined.  On the other hand, some theologically\ninspired claims are woven into the fabric of his metaphysics and\npsychology. For example, there are two souls, one sensitive and the\nother spiritual, and the latter is required in order to satisfy\nreligious demands for an immortal unity attached to, but not\nsusceptible to the fate of, the material body. But in such cases\nGassendi is generally clear about non-philosophical motives,\nintroducing such corrections or additions to his reasoned or\nempirically demonstrated views as are necessary by the dictates of\nfaith or Scripture. He frequently defends the primacy of Roman\nCatholicism and faith over natural reason (O I 5a, O I 49a, O II\n237a-b) yet easily distinguishes between objects of scientific and\ntheological investigation and reflection (O III (De\nProportione) 636a). To suggest that he arrives at the core tenets\nof his metaphysics or epistemology in order to draw out the ultimate\nconsequences of his theology thereby misconstrues his broad\nphilosophical motives as well as his particular reflective and\ninvestigative strategies.\n\n\nBy contrast, another element of recent scholarship highlights\nGassendi's philosophical motivations and strategies in sensu\nstrictu. In the years during and following the Second World War,\nBernard Rochot began this trend by bringing to light numerous\nlesser-known texts as well as the manuscript background to Gassendist\natomism. More recently, Fred and Emily Michael have called attention\nto empiricist sources and features of Gassendi's psychology and\nepistemology. Others offering assessments of Gassendi's views in\nsimilarly strict philosophical terms include Wolfgang Detel, Marco\nMesseri, and Antonia LoLordo. In this interpretive tradition, Richard\nPopkin elegantly poses the global character of the empiricism linking\nGassendist philosophy and science. Popkin (1967) ties together two\ncentral facets of Gassendi's thought, proposing that the\n\u2018constructive skepticism\u2019 at the core of his epistemology\nis an attempt (among other things) to show how to have an atomist\nscience\u2014through inferences based on our data concerning\nappearances.\n\n\nThe starting point of Gassendi's philosophy, in Popkin's view, is\nskepticism about knowledge of essences, mitigated by allowance for\nwarranted beliefs about appearances and causal knowledge to which we\nare entitled just because it helps us to make sense of beliefs about\nappearances. Among the intriguing elements of Popkin's assessment is\nthe suggestion that Gassendi promotes an early prototype of inference\nto the best explanation (IBE), defending atomism by appealing to its\nexplanatory value. Gassendi's strategy is a bit more complicated, for\nhe cannot grant that the evidence could be equally compelling for all\ncompeting theses, given his view that atomism is the physical thesis\nwhich best makes intelligible our experiential data to begin with. The\nunderlying methodological suggestion is that, in considering among\nphysical theses, the way we understand and interpret correlative data\nabout appearances may depend on which such thesis we are\nentertaining. In calling attention to Gassendi's appeal to IBE, Popkin\nidentifies a principal challenge in binding together principal themes\nof Gassendi's corpus, how to be an atomist and a thoroughgoing\nempiricist at once (Fisher 2005).\n",
