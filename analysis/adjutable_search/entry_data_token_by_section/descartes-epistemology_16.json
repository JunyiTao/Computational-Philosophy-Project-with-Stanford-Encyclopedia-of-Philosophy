    "main_text": "Perfect Knowledge, Circularity, and Truth || Another Cartesian Circle?\n6.3 Another Cartesian Circle?\n\nMichael Della Rocca has recently argued that a further circle arises\nfrom considerations in the Fourth Meditation \u2013 a problem he\nsuspects is \u201cmore difficult to get out of than the traditional\nproblem of circularity\u201d (2011, 98). To help clarify this further\ncircle, Della Rocca focuses on a twofold question:\n\nWhy, for Descartes, should we not assent to ideas that are not clear\nand distinct and why is there no such obligation not to assent to\nclear and distinct ideas? The reason Descartes offers seems to be that\nwe should not assent to ideas that are not clear and distinct because\nthey, unlike clear and distinct ideas, are not guaranteed to be true.\n(2011, 96)\n\n\nAs Della Rocca understands the broader Fourth Meditation argument, the\nclaim that we should assent only to what we clearly and distinctly\nperceive is an essential step in the ongoing argument to establish the\ndivine guarantee of clear and distinct perception. Since this step\npresupposes the eventual conclusion, that conclusion is based on\ncircular reasoning:\n\nOne of the premises needed for arguing that clear and distinct ideas\nare true is, as we have seen, that we should assent only to clear and\ndistinct ideas. This claim, in turn, requires argument, and the\nargument for it seems to be based on the claim that clear and distinct\nideas are guaranteed to be true. So, one of the premises of the\nargument for the claim that clear and distinct ideas are true is that\nclear and distinct ideas are guaranteed to be true. Here, the\nconclusion \u2013 indeed, a strengthened version of the conclusion\n\u2013 is itself a premise in the argument. (2011, 98)\n\n\nPerhaps we can avoid this alleged circle. The linchpin of Della\nRocca\u2019s charge of circularity is his contention that\n\u201cDescartes\u2019s reason for saying that we should assent only\nto clear and distinct ideas is that such ideas are guaranteed to be\ntrue and ideas that are not clear and distinct are not guaranteed to\nbe true\u201d (2011, 97). Though Descartes can be read in this way,\nthe texts support the following alternative understanding of the\nbroader argumentative narrative. In the First Meditation, the\nmeditator initially resolves that he should withhold assent to\nanything which is \u201cnot completely certain and indubitable\u201d\n(AT 7:18, CSM 2:12). Early in the Third Meditation, having reflected\non the epistemic impressiveness of the cogito, the meditator\ndiscovers that all, but only, clear and distinct\nperceptions are utterly assent-compelling. As a practical consequence,\nhis initial resolve effectively implies that he should assent only to\nclear and distinct perceptions \u2013 not because of presupposing the\nconclusion of the eventual proof of the C&D Rule, but because\nthese are the only perceptions to which he can\u2019t but\nassent. This provides a practical answer to Della Rocca\u2019s\nquestion, concerning why we should \u201cnot assent to ideas that are\nnot clear and distinct and why is there no such obligation not to\nassent to clear and distinct ideas.\u201d It is in the Fourth\nMeditation that the meditator purports to demonstrate the divine\nguarantee of the C&D Rule. However, no step of that demonstration\npresupposes that clear and distinct perceptions have already been\nestablished as true; i.e., the conclusion of the demonstration is not,\nas Della Rocca contends, \u201cbased on the claim that clear and\ndistinct ideas are guaranteed to be true.\u201d Rather (as we saw in\n Section 5.3),\n the conclusion purports to be based on an analysis of the respective\ncontributions of the intellect and the will, to judgment formation.\nSummarizing the key steps:\n\nSo what then is the source of my mistakes? It must be simply this: the\nscope of the will is wider than that of the intellect; but instead of\nrestricting it within the same limits, I extend its use to matters\nwhich I do not understand. (AT 7:58, CSM 2:40)\n\n\nGranted, the meditator needs each of the demonstrative steps to be\nclearly and distinctly perceived. However, he needs this not because\nof presupposing the conclusion to be proved, but in order to be in\ncompliance with his own initial resolve, stated in the First\nMeditation \u2013 to withhold assent to anything which is\n\u201cnot completely certain and indubitable.\u201d\n\nCentral to the above account avoiding Della Rocca\u2019s circle is\n(among other claims) the thesis that clear and distinct perceptions\nare assent-compelling \u2013 i.e., as Descartes writes, that\n\u201cthe nature of my mind is such that I cannot but assent to these\nthings, at least so long as I clearly perceive them.\u201d It it thus\nworth noting that Della Rocca wavers on whether Descartes holds this\nthesis: he interprets a remark in Descartes\u2019 correspondence (9\nFeb 1645, AT 4:173, CSMK 245) to suggest \u201cthat we can withhold\nassent from even a current clear and distinct perception\u201d (2006,\n155).\n",
