    "main_text": "Life and Work || A.W. Schlegel\u2019s Writings and Their Reception\n1.2 A.W. Schlegel\u2019s Writings and Their Reception\n An anthology of some of A.W. Schlegel\u2019s critical essays,\nselected by the author himself, was published in Berlin in 1828.\nDespite his opposition to the publication of the rest of his essays,\nA.W. Schlegel\u2019s \u2018collected works\u2019 were edited by E.\nB\u00f6cking and published in 16 volumes between 1846 and 1848 (the\ncollection is not complete). Since then, there has been no standard,\ncritical edition of his works. A critical edition of his Vienna\nlectures was edited by E. Behler in 1989 (the edition of his complete\nlectures is still in progress), and (some of his) his letters were\nedited by J. K\u00f6rner and published in 1930. All in all, the\nsituation of A.W. Schlegel\u2019s texts leaves much to be\ndesired.\n\nEspecially during the Athenaeum period, Schlegel\u2019s\nwritings are witty, original, and sagacious in both form and content\n(e.g., Die Sprachen, Die Gem\u00e4lde). After this\nperiod, i.e., once he started lecturing at the University, his style\nseems to lose its boldness and wit, gaining perhaps in depth and\nerudition. Some scholars suggest that these two developments are not\nunconnected (cf. Paulin 2016: 126).  Thus, while stressing their\nformal perfection, critics of his literary writings\n(Gedichte, 1800;\nIon, 1803; Poetische Werke, 1811) tend to justify\nhis lack of success as a poet. It is as if A.W. Schlegel was not able\nto follow the aesthetics standards that he himself had developed\ntheoretically. Other scholars, however, consider his play Ion\na great success. But, on the whole, Heinrich Heine\u2019s view that\nboth Friedrich and August Wilhelm Schlegel \u201cwere critics and\ninterpreters rather than poets\u201d (Heine [1833] 1985: 2) seems to be\nwidely accepted (cf. Craig 2000: 863; Ziolkowski 2016: 270), even by\nthose who are critical towards Heine\u2019s extremely negative and\nsarcastic outbursts against the Schlegels.\n\nBy contrast, Schlegel\u2019s lectures as well as his translations\n(some of which are still used today) were very successful and\ninfluential. It was indeed A.W.  Schlegel\u2019s lectures, with their\nparticular view of world literature as an organic whole, that were to\ninfluence many authors.  F.W.J. Schelling (the most Romantic of the\nGerman idealist philosophers) and G.W. Hegel, for instance, used\nSchlegel\u2019s Jena lectures as a basis for the elaboration of\ntheir Lectures on the Philosophy of Art (1802\u20131804)\nand Lectures on Aesthetics (1818) respectively. But\nA.W. Schlegel\u2019s influence was not restricted to Germany\nalone. His lectures, having been translated into many languages and\nsuccessfully promoted by authors such as Mme de Sta\u00ebl (Grundmann\n2005: 40), were also extremely influential abroad\u2014S.T. Coleridge\nbeing perhaps the most notable example (cf. Helmholtz-Phelan 1907). In\nthe preface to his critical essays (Kritische Schriften,\nBerlin, 1828), Schlegel explains how many of the\n\u2018revolutionary\u2019 ideas he had formerly defended in his\nessays and lectures had been internalized and normalized by those very\ncritics who had once rejected them with\ncontempt. A.W. Schlegel\u2019s response to this was modest: he said,\nhe had just been able to foresee the coming shift of taste and\nevaluative parameters in the understanding and the interpretation of\nworks of art (KS: I, vi).\n\nSome critics have argued that, as a literary critic, A.W. Schlegel is\nmore empirical and less philosophical than his brother Friedrich\n(cf. Welleck 1955: 72\u201373). And it has even been questioned\nwhether A.W. Schlegel is the genuine creator of the ideas laid out in\nhis writings and lectures (Heine [1833] 1985: 47). Yet, however convincing\nthe distinction between \u2018having\ncreated\u2019 the ideas as opposed to merely \u2018having\ndisseminated\u2019 them may seem, this claim is quite\ndisputable. Schlegel\u2019s philosophical analyses of art and the\nartist were undoubtedly inspired by his reading of and/or encounters\nwith Herder, Kant, Fichte, Goethe, Schiller, and Schelling among\nothers, but he developed his own poetology. A.W. Schlegel\u2019s\nlectures had a unique dialectic character (Schlegel himself suggest\nthat his lectures are to be understood as a dialogue), combining high\ntheoretical standards with an appealing, empirical approach, thus\noffering \u201cone of the first narratives of the historical and\nphilosophical interrelation of all art forms\u201d (Franzel 2014:\n351). In the development and presentation of his theoretical position,\nhe was indeed less speculative than other German philosophers (such as\nHegel). But as Walter Benjamin notes, this is the result of a\nconscious decision to make room for a more critical approach, which\nrenders Schlegel\u2019s position surprisingly modern (Benjamin [1920]\n1996: 118). In a mixture of pride and censure, Schlegel frequently\nnotes how German authors are more speculative than practical (LDA: 16\nand 440). Moreover, his aesthetical essays can be seen as a comment on\nand criticism of those more speculative Germanic approaches in which\nthe particular work of art and the artist seem to be relegated to a\nsecondary level and are treated like the piece of a theoretical\n\u2018whole\u2019. Die Gem\u00e4lde, a dialogue on painting\nas well as a fictive visit through the gallery of Dresden (cf. Penzel\n2007: 77ff.) that he co-wrote with Caroline Michaelis, is a good\nexample of this, precisely for the attentive way in which it\napproaches and engages with the individual paintings (Paulin 2016:\n160). Overall, though, A.W. Schlegel\u2019s writings are prolific,\nbut remain somewhat unfocused and repetitive. As Schlegel himself had\noften regretted, by taking too many different topics into\nconsideration, his work lost the intensity of its philosophical and\ncritical insights.\n\nAlthough Schlegel\u2019s lectures were \u201cavidly devoured by\nintellectuals from all of the European countries\u201d (Engel and\nLehmann 2004: 84) and in spite of what could be regarded as quite a\nsuccess during his lifetime\u2014Schlegel himself was proud to have\nbeen read \u201cfrom Cadiz to Edinburgh, Stockholm and St.\nPetersburg\u201d (Schirmer 1986: 233) \u2013, the works of A.W.\nSchlegel have suffered from an arguably unfair and prejudiced neglect.\nA first full-scale biography was only published in 2016 (!). In this\nbiography, Roger Paulin argues that Schlegel\u2019s reputation\n\u201cnever quite recovered from Heine\u2019s devastating attack in\nDie Romantische Schule of 1835\u201d (Paulin 2016: 3).\n\u201cApart from the Vienna Lectures and the Shakespeare\ntranslations\u201d, he writes, \u201cit is Heine\u2019s attack that\nremains in the general consciousness\u201d, so that in the end the\nimage that pervades is one of \u201cdecline,\nd\u00e9ch\u00e9ance, decrepitude, impotence\u201d\n(Paulin 2016: 542). Nonetheless, the recent rising number of\ndissertations, articles, and even monographies (such as\nPaulin\u2019s) dedicated to different aspects A.W. Schlegel\u2019s\nwritings, seem to suggest that there is a slow but steady change of\nattitude towards his work.\n",
