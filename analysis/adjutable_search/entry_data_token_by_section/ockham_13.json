    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy\n5. Natural Philosophy\n\nOckham\u2019s \u201cphysics\u201d or natural philosophy is of a\nbroadly Aristotelian sort, although he interprets Aristotle in his own\nfashion. Ockham wrote a great deal in this area; indeed his\nExposition of Aristotle\u2019s Physics is his longest work\nexcept for his Commentary on the\n Sentences.[36]\n\nAs a nominalist about universals, Ockham had to deal with the\nAristotelian claim in the Posterior Analytics that science\npertains to certain propositions about what is universal and\nnecessary. He discusses this issue in the Prologue to his\nExposition of the\n Physics,[37]\n and there agrees with Aristotle. But he interprets Aristotle\u2019s\ndictum as saying that knowledge bears upon certain propositions with\ngeneral (universal) terms in them; it is only in that sense that\nscience deals with the universal. This of course does not mean that\nfor Ockham our scientific knowledge can never get beyond the level of\nlanguage to actual things. He distinguishes various senses of\n\u2018to know\u2019 (scire, from which we get\nscientia or \u201cscience\u201d):\n\nIn one sense, to \u201cknow\u201d is to know a proposition, or a\nterm in that proposition. It is in this sense that the object of a\nscience is universal, and this is what Aristotle had in mind.\nIn another sense, we can be said to \u201cknow\u201d what the\nproposition is about, what its terms have supposition for. What we\n\u201cknow\u201d in that sense is always metaphysically individual,\nsince for Ockham there isn\u2019t anything else. This is not the\nsense in which Aristotle was speaking.\n\n\nAs described\n earlier,\n Ockham holds that we do not need to allow special entities in all ten\nof Aristotle\u2019s categories. In particular, we do not need them in\nthe category of quantity. For Ockham, there is no need for real\n\u201cmathematical\u201d entities such as numbers, points, lines,\nand surfaces as distinct from individual substances and qualities.\nApparent talk about such things can invariably be parsed away, via the\ntheory of connotation or exposition, in favor of talk about substances\nand qualities (and, in certain theological contexts, a few relations).\nThis Ockhamist move is illustrative of and influential on an important\ndevelopment in late medieval physics: the application of mathematics\nto non-mathematical things, culminating in Galileo\u2019s famous\nstatement that the \u201cbook of nature\u201d is written in the\n\u201clanguage of mathematics.\u201d\n\nSuch an application of mathematics violates a traditional Aristotelian\nprohibition against metabasis eis allo genos, grounded on\nquite reasonable considerations. The basic idea is that things cannot\nbe legitimately compared in any respect in which they differ in\nspecies. Thus it makes little sense to ask whether the soprano\u2019s\nhigh C is higher or lower than Mount Everest\u2014much less to ask\n(quantitatively) how much higher or lower it is. But for\nAristotle, straight lines and curved lines belong to different species\nof lines. Hence they cannot be meaningfully compared or measured\nagainst one another. The same holds for rectilinear motion and\ncircular motion. \n\nAlthough the basic idea is reasonable enough, Ockham recognized that\nthere are problems. The length of a coiled rope, for example, can\nstraightforwardly be compared to the length of an uncoiled rope, and\nthe one can meaningfully be said to be longer or shorter than, or\nequal in length to, the other. For that matter, a single rope\nsurely stays the same length, whether it is coiled or extended\nfull-length. Ockham\u2019s solution to these problems is to note\nthat, on his ontology, straight lines and curved lines are not\nreally different species of lines\u2014because lines are not\nextra things in the first place. Talk about lines is simply a\n\u201cmanner of speaking\u201d about substances and qualities.\n\nThus, to compare a \u201ccurved\u201d (coiled) rope with a\n\u201cstraight\u201d (uncoiled) one is not really to talk about the\nlengths of lines in two different species; it is to talk about two\nropes. To describe the one as curved (coiled) and the other\nas straight (uncoiled) is not to appeal to specifically different\nkinds of entities\u2014curvature and straightness\u2014but merely to\ndescribe the ropes in ways that can be expounded according to two\ndifferent patterns. Since such talk does not have ontological\nimplications that require specifically different kinds of entities,\nthe Aristotelian prohibition of metabasis does not apply.\n\nOnce one realizes that we can appeal to connotation theory, and more\ngenerally the theory of exposition, without invoking new entities, the\ndoor is opened to applying mathematical analyses (all of which are\nexponible, for Ockham) to all kinds of things, and in particular to\nphysical nature.\n\nOckham\u2019s contributions were by no means the only factor in the\nincreasing mathematization of science in the fourteenth century. But\nthey were important\n ones.[38]\n",
