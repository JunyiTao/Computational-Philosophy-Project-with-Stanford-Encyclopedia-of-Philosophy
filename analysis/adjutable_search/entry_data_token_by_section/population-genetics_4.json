    "main_text": "Population-Genetic Models of Evolution || Selection-Mutation Balance\n3.2 Selection-Mutation Balance\n\nMutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation, preventing\npopulations from becoming genetically homogeneous. Once mutation is\ntaken into account, the conclusions drawn in the previous section need\nto be modified. Even if one allele is selectively superior to all\nothers at a given locus, it will not become fixed in the population;\nrecurrent mutation will ensure that other alleles are present at low\nfrequency, thus maintaining a degree of polymorphism. Population\ngeneticists have long been interested in exploring what happens when\nselection and mutation act simultaneously.\n\nContinuing with our one locus, two allele model, suppose that the\n\\(A_1\\) allele is selectively superior to\n\\(A_2\\), but recurrent mutation from\n\\(A_1\\) to \\(A_2\\) prevents\n\\(A_1\\) from spreading to fixation. The rate of\nmutation from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_2\\) per\ngeneration, i.e., the proportion of \\(A_1\\) alleles\nthat mutate every generation, is denoted \\(u\\). (Empirical\nestimates of mutation rates are typically in the region of\n\\(10^{-6}\\).) Back mutation from \\(A_2\\) to\n\\(A_1\\) can be ignored, because we are assuming that\nthe \\(A_2\\) allele is at a very low frequency in the\npopulation, thanks to natural selection. What happens to the gene\nfrequency dynamics under these assumptions? Recall equation (1) above,\nwhich expresses the frequency of the \\(A_1\\) allele in\nterms of its frequency in the previous generation. Since a certain\nfraction \\((u)\\) of the \\(A_1\\) alleles will have\nmutated to \\(A_2\\), this recurrence equation must be\nmodified to:\n\n\\[\np' = \\frac{(p^2 w_{11} + pq w_{12}) (1 - u)}{w}\n\\]\n\n\nto take account of mutation. As before, equilibrium is reached when\n\\(p' = p\\), i.e., \\(\\Delta p = 0\\). The\ncondition for equilibrium is therefore:\n\n\\[\\tag{3}\np = p^* = \\frac{(p^2 w_{11} + pq w_{12}) (1 - u)}{w}\n\\]\n\n\nA useful simplification of equation (3) can be achieved by making some\nassumptions about the genotype fitnesses, and adopting a new notation.\nLet us suppose that the \\(A_2\\) allele is completely recessive (as is\noften the case for deleterious mutants). This means that the \\(A_1\nA_1\\) and \\(A_1 A_2\\) genotypes have identical fitness. Therefore,\ngenotypic fitnesses can be written \\(w_{11} = 1,\\) \\(w_{12} = 1,\\)\n\\(w_{22} = 1 - s,\\) where \\(s\\) denotes the difference in fitness of\nthe \\(A_2 A_2\\) homozygote from that of the other two\ngenotypes. \\((s\\) is known as the selection coefficient\nagainst \\(A_2 A_2)\\). Since we are assuming that the \\(A_2\\) allele is\ndeleterious, it follows that \\(s \\gt 0\\). Substituting these genotype\nfitnesses in equation (3) yields:\n\n\n\\[\np^* = \\frac{p (1 - u)}{p^2 + 2pq + q^2 (1 - s)}\n\\]\n\n\nwhich reduces to:\n\n\\[\np^* = 1 - \\left(\\frac{u}{s}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n\nor equivalently (since \\(p + q = 1)\\):\n\n\\[\\tag{4}\nq^* = \\left(\\frac{u}{s}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n\nEquation (4) gives the equilibrium frequency of the \\(A_2\\) allele,\nunder the assumption that it is completely recessive. Note that as\n\\(u\\) increases, \\(q\\)* increases too. This is highly intuitive: the\ngreater the mutation rate from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_2\\), the greater the\nfrequency of \\(A_2\\) that can be maintained at equilibrium, for a\ngiven value of \\(s\\). Conversely, as \\(s\\) increases, \\(q\\)*\ndecreases. This is also intuitive: the stronger the selection against\nthe \\(A_2 A_2\\) homozygote, the lower the equilibrium frequency of\n\\(A_2\\), for a given value of \\(u\\).\n\nIt is easy to see why equation (4) is said to describe\nselection-mutation balance\u2014natural selection is\ncontinually removing \\(A_2\\) alleles from the population, while\nmutation is continually re-creating them. Equation (4) tells us the\nequilibrium frequency of \\(A_2\\) that will be maintained, as a\nfunction of the rate of mutation from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_2\\) and the\nmagnitude of the selective disadvantage suffered by the \\(A_2 A_2\\)\nhomozygote. Though equation (4) was derived under the assumption that\nthe \\(A_2\\) allele is completely recessive, it is straightforward to\nderive similar equations for the cases where the \\(A_2\\) allele is\ndominant, or partially dominant. In those cases, \\(A_2\\)\u2019s\nequilibrium frequency will be lower than if it is completely\nrecessive; for selection is more efficient at removing it from the\npopulation. A deleterious allele that is recessive can\n\u2018hide\u2019 in heterozygotes, and thus escape the purging power\nof selection, but a dominant allele cannot.\n\nOur discussion in this section has focused on deleterious mutations,\ni.e., ones which reduce the fitness of their host organism. This may\nseem odd, given that beneficial mutations play a key role in the\nevolutionary process. The reason is that in population genetics, a\nmajor concern is to understand the causes of the genetic variability\nfound in biological populations. If a gene is beneficial, natural\nselection is likely to be the major determinant of its equilibrium\nfrequency; the rate of sporadic mutation to that gene will play at\nmost a minor role. It is only where a gene is deleterious that\nmutation plays a major role in maintaining it in a population.\n",
