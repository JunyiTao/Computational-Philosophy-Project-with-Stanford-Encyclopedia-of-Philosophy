    "main_text": "The Basic Dutch Book Argument for Probabilism || A Detailed Version of the Dutch Book Argument\n1.2 A Detailed Version of the Dutch Book Argument\n\nThe Dutch Book argument has often been presented as establishing that\ndegrees of belief that violate the axioms are irrational because they\ncan (or do) lead to bad consequences. It assumes that an agent\u2019s\ndegrees of belief are associated with her betting quotients such that\n(1) for an agent with degree of belief \\(q\\) in \\(M\\)\na bet on or against \\(M\\) at\ncorresponding odds will be acceptable. With payoffs in dollars and\nstake \\(S\\), this amounts to the claim that the agent\nshould be willing to take either direction of a bet with a cost of\n$\\(Sq\\) that pays\n\n\n\n\\($S\\)\nif \\(M\\) \n\n\\($0\\)\notherwise  \n\n\nBut then (2) by the Dutch Book theorem a cunning bettor could assure\nhimself a profit from someone who violates the probability axioms.\nSince (3) violating the axioms leaves the bettor open to being Dutch\nBooked (that is, being on the losing side of the Dutch Book) because\nher degrees of belief make acceptable bets leading to a sure loss, it\nis concluded that (4) one ought to satisfy the probability axioms\n(i.e. that probabilism is true). In some presentations, the first\npremise is strengthened to the claim that the agent actually will\naccept those bets on \\(M\\) for which her degree of\nbelief matches the betting quotient, in an effort to tighten the\nconnection between violating the axioms and the sure loss.\n\nA bit of terminology is in need of clarification here. De Finetti\nidentified degrees of belief with betting quotients and termed degrees\nof belief that are susceptible to a Dutch Book incoherent;\nthose that are not so susceptible he called coherent (de Finetti\n1937). \u2018Susceptible\u2019 here should be understood in the\nsense of the above theorem, namely that bets are specifiable\ncorresponding to those degrees of belief that will produce a sure loss\nto one side. Given the theorem, coherence amounts to satisfaction of\nthe probability axioms, with incoherence involving their violation,\nand accordingly the terms are often used as a shorthand way of\nspecifying whether the axioms are satisfied. However, both Ramsey and\nde Finetti understood incoherence to be a kind of inconsistency, and\nsome use the term in this sense. There are various questions about\nunderstanding violation of the probability axioms and susceptibility\nto a Dutch Book as a  kind of inconsistency, as will be\ndiscussed, and so here it will be best to use \u2018incoherent\u2019\nfor degrees of belief that violate the probability axioms, and that by\nthe Dutch Book theorem are associated with susceptibility to a sure\nloss, and leave open whether incoherence understood as such involves a\nform of inconsistency.\n",
