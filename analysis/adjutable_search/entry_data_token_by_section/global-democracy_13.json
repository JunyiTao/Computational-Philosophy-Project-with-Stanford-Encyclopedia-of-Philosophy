This is particularly problematic because IR\ntheorists have, for many years, highlighted the anarchical and\npower-laden nature of international politics (Morgenthau 1954). This\nview is especially prominent among realists and neo-realists who claim\nthat states are the fundamental units of world politics, and that\npower\u2014understood as material capabilities\u2014is the main\ncurrency of transnational interaction. Drawing parallels with\nHobbes\u2019s state of nature, realists argue that anarchy forces\nstates into a situation of self-help which, in turn, creates security\ndilemmas as states seek to defend their sovereign borders.\nInternational institutions, when they do exist, reflect the prevailing\ndistribution of power and the interests of dominant states. Although\nneo-liberal theorists (such as Robert Keohane) and constructivists\n(such as Alexander Wendt) have argued that cooperation between states\ncan be attained under anarchy, these camps still agree that power\npolitics dominates transnational affairs.\n\n\nGlobal democracy, as should be clear, requires the equal inclusion\nof individuals in transnational decision-making processes. For most IR\ntheorists, this is simply impossible. States are the key players in\nworld politics, and individuals have standing only through their\nnational political system. Although Pareto optimal (i.e.\nmutually-beneficial) forms of international cooperation can occur in\nworld politics, states will always strive for more power and exploit\nrelative differentials in material capabilities to fulfill national\npreferences. The drive and desire of each national government to\nmaximize their absolute and relative power vis-\u00e0-vis other\nstates directly undercuts the cosmopolitan ideal upon which global\ndemocracy is (typically) predicated.\n\n\nAlthough realist theories have much explanatory power, neo-liberal and\nconstructivist scholars increasingly point to the constraining nature\nof law and ideas in world politics. Constructivists, in particular,\nhave forcefully noted that \u2018anarchy is what states make of\nit\u2019 (Wendt 2003, 491). In other words, the realist\ninterpretation of world politics is precisely that:\na cultural and historical interpretation. The\nfundamental nature of international society can and does change over\ntime, and therefore new forms of social and political interactions are\nalways possible. This suggests that power politics is not some\nimmutable condition of international affairs, but rather a situation\nthat can be overcome through new forms of cognition, cooperation, and\ncontestation. As such, cosmopolitan notions of global democracy are\ncertainly conceivable. As Linklater (1998) argues, emerging dialogical\ncommunities of affected peoples are creating transnational social\nrelations that are more universalistic, less unequal, and have greater\nsensitivity to cultural differences.\n\n\nIn sum, global democrats would do well to tackle more directly issues\nof power politics and engage with core debates in IR. This may allow\nfor insights to be shed on both topics. IR schools\u2014such as\nrealism, neo-realism, neo-liberalism, constructivism, and\ncommunicative action\u2014have traditionally been concerned with\nsocial-scientific, historical, and explanatory analysis. These camps\nhave been less willing or able to question their own normative\nunderpinnings or offer critical prescriptions for future design.\nInversely, global democrats have had a predominantly normative\norientation, but neglected to engage rigorously with social-scientific\nmethodology or make full use of the empirical analysis offered by IR\nscholars. As such, fruitful cross-fertilization may be possible as we\nseek to understand how normative values can be pursued under existing\nconditions of material differentials where the threat of international\nand civil war, climate change disaster, financial crises, and many\nother issues still loom large.\n",
