    "main_text": "Central Results || Cognitive diversity\n4.3 Cognitive diversity\n\nAs we have seen in\n Section 2.1,\n the problem of cognitive diversity concerns the relation between the\ndiversity of cognitive features of scientists (including their\nbackground beliefs, reasoning styles, research preferences, heuristics\nand strategies) and the inquiry of the scientific community.\nPhilosophers of science have especially been interested in how the\ndivision of labor across different research heuristics impacts the\nperformance of the community.\n\nA particularly influential ABM tackling this issue is the epistemic\nlandscape model by Weisberg and Muldoon (2009). The model examines the\ndivision of labor catalyzed by different research strategies, where\nscientists can act as the \u201ccontrols\u201d,\n\u201cfollowers\u201d or \u201cmavericks\u201d (see above\n Section 3.1).\n In view of the simulations, Weisberg and Muldoon argue that, first,\nmavericks outperform other research strategies. Second, if we consider\nthe maverick strategy to be costly in terms of the necessary\nresources, then introducing mavericks to populations of followers can\nlead to an optimal division of labor. While Weisberg and\nMuldoon\u2019s ABM eventually turned out to include a coding error\n(Alexander et al. 2015), their claim that cognitive diversity improves\nthe productivity of scientists received support from adjusted versions\nof the model, albeit with some qualifications.\n\nFirst, Thoma\u2019s (2015) model showed that cognitively diverse\ngroups outperform homogeneous ones if scientists are sufficiently\nflexible to change their current approach and sufficiently informed\nabout the research conducted by others in the community. Second,\nP\u00f6yh\u00f6nen (2017) confirmed that if we consider the maverick\nstrategy to be slightly more time-consuming, mixed populations of\nmavericks and followers may outperform communities consisting only of\nmavericks in terms of the average epistemic significance of the\nobtained results. According to P\u00f6yh\u00f6nen, another condition\nthat needs to be satisfied if cognitive diversity is to be beneficial\nconcerns the topology of the landscape: diverse populations outperform\nhomogeneous ones only in case of more challenging inquiries\n(represented in terms of rugged epistemic landscapes), but not in case\nof easy research problems (represented by landscapes such as Weisberg\nand Muldoon\u2019s one,\n Figure 2).\n The importance of the topology of the landscape was also emphasized\nby Alexander and colleagues (2015) who use NK-landscapes to show that\nwhether social learning is beneficial or not crucially depends on the\nlandscape\u2019s topology. Finally, there are other research\nstrategies (such as Alexander and colleagues\u2019\n\u201cswarm\u201d one, see\n Section 3.1.1)\n that outperform Weisberg and Muldoon\u2019s mavericks, while small\nchanges in the follower strategy may significantly improve its\nperformance (Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto & Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto\n2018).\n\nAnother aspect of cognitive diversity that received attention in the\nmodeling literature concerns the relationship between diversity and\nexpertise. This issue was first studied in economics by Hong and Page\n(2004). The model examined how heuristically diverse groups,\nconsisting of agents with diverse problem-solving approaches, compare\nwith groups consisting solely of experts with respect to finding a\nsolution to a particular problem. Hong and Page\u2019s original\nresult suggested that \u201cdiversity trumps ability\u201d in the\nsense that groups consisting of individuals employing diverse\nheuristic approaches outperfom groups consisting solely of experts,\nthat is, agents who are the best \u201cproblem-solvers\u201d. While\nthis finding became quite influential, subsequent studies showed that\nit does not hold robustly once more realistic assumptions about\nexpertise are added to the model (Grim, Singer, Bramson, et al. 2019;\nReijula & Kuorikoski 2021; see also Singer 2019).\n\nThe problem of cognitive diversity and the division of labor in\nscientific communities was also studied by Hegselmann and\nKrause\u2019s bounded-confidence model (Hegselmann & Krause 2006;\nsee above\n Section 3.3).\n The ABM examines opinion dynamics in a community that is diverse in\nthe sense that only some individuals are active truth seekers, while\nothers adjust their beliefs by exchanging opinions with those agents\nwho have sufficiently similar beliefs to their own. Hegselmann and\nKrause investigate conditions under which such a community can reach\nconsensus on the truth, combining agent-based modeling and analytical\nmethods. They show that, on the one hand, if all agents in the model\nare truth seekers, they achieve a consensus on the truth. On the other\nhand, if the community divides labor, its ability to reach a consensus\non the truth will depend on the number of truth seeking agents, the\nposition of the truth relative to the agents\u2019 opinions, the\ndegree of confidence determining the scope of opinion exchange and the\nrelative weight of the truth signal (in contrast to the weight of\nsocial information). For instance, under certain parameter settings\neven a single truth-seeking agent will lead the rest of the community\nto the truth.\n",
