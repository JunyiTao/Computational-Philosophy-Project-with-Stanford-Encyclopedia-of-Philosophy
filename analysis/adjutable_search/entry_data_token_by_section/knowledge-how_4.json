    "main_text": "The Regress Argument || Lewis Carroll\u2019s Regress\n1.4 Lewis Carroll\u2019s Regress\n\nA less discussed regress that can be found in Ryle (1946: 6\u20137)\nis an adaptation of Lewis Carroll\u2019s (1895) regress. Suppose a\nstudent understands the premises of an argument and also its\nconclusion but fails to see that the conclusion follows. In order to\nhelp him, the teacher teaches him another proposition\nP\u2014i.e., if the premises are true, then the conclusion is\ntrue. The student understands this and yet fails to see how from the\npremises and the additional premise P the conclusion follows. A\nsecond hypothetical proposition is added to his store, the proposition\nthat if the premises is true, the conclusion is true too. The student\nstill fails to see. And so on. Ryle concludes: \n\n\nKnowing a rule of inference is not possessing a bit of extra\ninformation but being able to perform an intelligent operation.\nKnowing a rule is knowing how. It is realized in performances which\nconform to the rule, not in theoretical citations of it. (1946: 7)\n\n\n\nOne might respond (cf. Stanley 2011b) to this regress challenge that\nthe student does not really understand the premises of an argument by\nmodus ponens (p, if p then q), for that\ninvolves grasping the concept of a conditional, and on an\ninferentialist understanding (Boghossian 1996, 2003), that would\ndispose one to accept the conclusion of an inference by that rule.\nInferentialism about meaning is, however, a controversial doctrine\n(for several criticisms, see Williamson 2011, 2012). Other replies\nmight be available. Maybe the student does not represent the rule\npractically (see next section), or she is simply incapable of granting\nthat the rule applies to this case, for that would explain her failure\nto be appropriately disposed to arrive at the conclusion, given the\ntruth of the premises. (For yet other versions of the regress\nchallenge, see No\u00eb 2005: 285\u20136 and Hetherington 2006).\n",
