    "main_text": "Moral principles\n3. Moral principles\n\nThe discerning, inferring and elaborating of moral principles is a\ntask for practical reasonableness. The judgments one makes in doing\nthis are together called one\u2019s conscience, in a sense\nprior to the sense in which conscience is the judgments one passes or\ncould pass on one\u2019s own acts considered retrospectively. Someone\nwhose conscience is sound has in place the basic elements of sound\njudgment and practical reasonableness, that is of the intellectual and\nmoral virtue which Aquinas calls prudentia. Full\nprudentia requires that one put one\u2019s sound judgment\ninto effect all the way down, i.e. into the particulars of choice and\naction in the face of temptations to unreasonable but perhaps not\nunintelligent alternatives.\n",
