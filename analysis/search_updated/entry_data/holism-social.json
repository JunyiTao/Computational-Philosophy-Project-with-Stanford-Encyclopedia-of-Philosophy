    "preamble": "\n\nThe debate between methodological holists and methodological\nindividualists concerns the proper focus of explanations in the social\nsciences: to what extent should social scientific explanations revolve\naround social phenomena and individuals, respectively? The discussion\ntakes two main forms.\n\nThe most enduring debate surrounds the issue of dispensability.\nMethodological holists engaged in this debate defend the view that\nexplanations that invoke social phenomena (e.g., institutions, social\nstructures or cultures) should be offered within the social sciences:\ntheir use is indispensable. Explanations of this sort are variously\nreferred to as holist, collectivist, social (-level), or macro\n(-level) explanations. They are exemplified by claims such as\n\u201cthe unions protested because the government wanted to lower the\nnational minimum wage\u201d, or \u201cthe rise in unemployment led\nto a higher crime rate\u201d. Holist explanations may be contrasted\nwith explanations that are expressed in terms of individuals, their\nactions, beliefs, desires, and the like. The latter are variously\ntermed individualist, individual (-level), or micro (-level)\nexplanations. They are illustrated by claims such as \u201cAnna baked\na cake because Susan wanted it\u201d, or\n\n\nas a result of individuals a, b, c, etc.\nlosing their jobs, and feeling very frustrated about having little\nmoney and no job opportunities, the crime rate went up.\n\n\nMethodological holists may or may not hold that individualist\nexplanations should be offered in addition to holist explanations.\nWhatever methodological holists\u2019 stand on this issue, they are\nopposed by methodological individualists who insist that individualist\nexplanations alone should be provided within the social sciences, and\nthus, that holist explanations should be dispensed with.\n\nThe other, more recent dispute between methodological holists and\nindividualists is concerned with the issue of microfoundations.\nMethodological holists involved in this debate defend the view that in\nsome cases, purely holist explanations (i.e., explanations stated\nsolely in terms of social phenomena) may stand on their own: they do\nnot invariably need individual-level microfoundations. A purely holist\nexplanation might be \u201cthe economic depression was the main\nreason why the war broke out\u201d. Methodological holists may\nmaintain that this explanation is fine as it stands; it need not be\nsupplemented with further details specifying how the economic\ndepression incited individuals to adopt certain beliefs, act in\ncertain ways, etc., that in turn led to the outbreak of the war.\nMethodological individualists disagree, insisting that such additional\naccounts must always be provided.\n\nWithin philosophy and the social sciences, whether in the context of\nthe dispensability or the microfoundations debate, proponents of\nmethodological holism do not necessarily describe their position in\nsuch terms. In fact, this is seldom so within the social sciences. In\ncertain cases, some alternative label is used, for example, when\n\u201cexplanatory holism\u201d and \u201ccollectivism\u201d are\nemployed to denote the view that holist explanations are\nindispensable. In other cases, no label at all is attributed to one or\nboth of the views that are here described as methodologically holist.\nIn this entry, differences of terminology will be disregarded: the\nterm \u201cmethodological holism\u201d is used to describe both the\nthesis that holist explanations are indispensable, as well as the\nthesis that purely holist explanations do not always need\nindividual-level microfoundations.\n\nThe methodological individualism-holism debate that concerns the\nproper focus of social scientific explanations is just one among\nseveral individualism-holism disputes. Most notably, there are\nindividualism-holism debates about ontology, confirmation, and\nmorality. Within these discussions, holism is the view that social\nphenomena exist sui generis, or in their own right (the\nontological debate); that social scientific explanations need not\nalways be confirmed by looking at what happens at the level of\nindividuals (the debate on confirmation); and that moral\nresponsibility may sometimes be ascribed to social entities such as\ngroups (one version of the moral debate). It is perfectly possible,\nand in fact quite common, to subscribe to methodological holism in the\nsense defined in this entry without endorsing these other forms of\nholism. Though interesting, these debates will not be directly\naddressed here.\n\nThe following discussion of methodological holism consists of two\nparts. Sections 1 and 2 examine the dispensability debate, and\nSections 3 and 4 consider the microfoundations debate. Both parts\nfocus on methodological holists\u2019 views\u2014and\narguments\u2014in these disputes. For a characterization of\nmethodological individualism, see the entry on\n methodological individualism.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Dispensability Debate\n\nThe defense of methodological holism dates back to at least the turn\nof the nineteenth century. Around this time, Emile Durkheim advocated\nthe indispensability of holist explanations in a number of writings\n(see e.g., Durkheim 1938[1895], 1951[1897]). He famously stated that\nthe\n\n\ndetermining cause of a social fact should be sought among the\nsocial facts preceding it and not among the states of the individual\nconsciousness. (Durkheim 1938 [1895]: 110\u2014italics in the\noriginal)\n\n\nHis work is typically juxtaposed to that of Max Weber, who is regarded\nas the main proponent of methodological individualism during this\nperiod. In the subsequent history of the debate, there are two phases\nthat particularly stand out. The first began around the 1950s, when\nFriedrich Hayek, Karl Popper, and J.W.N. Watkins argued ardently in\nsupport of methodological individualism. In response, Ernest Gellner,\nLeon G. Goldstein, Maurice Mandelbaum, and others maintained that\nthere were alternative ways of cashing out, and defending,\nmethodological holism that were left unscathed by Hayek\u2019s,\nPopper\u2019s and Watkins\u2019 objections (see Gellner 1973 [1956];\nGoldstein 1973a [1956], 1973b [1958]; Mandelbaum 1955, 1973 [1957].\nThey all appear in O\u2019Neill 1973, which also contains other\nimportant contributions from this period).\n\nThe second significant period stretches from around the 1980s up until\ntoday. From the perspective of methodological holism, this phase is\nmarked by the appearance of a number of new, or new versions of,\narguments in support of the indispensability of holist explanations.\nIn this phase, seminal contributions to the dispensability debate were\nmade by Roy Bhaskar, Alan Garfinkel, Harold Kincaid, Frank Jackson and\nPhilip Pettit to mention just a few (see Bhaskar 1979; Garfinkel 1981;\nKincaid 1996, 1997; Jackson and Pettit 1992a, 1992b). The following\nsection focuses on the most important arguments advanced during this\nlast\u2014and still unfolding\u2014period. (See Zahle and Collin\n2014a for a collection of papers from this period.) The remainder of\nthe present section is concerned with the further introduction of the\npositions at play within the dispensability debate. As noted above,\nspecial attention will be paid to the methodological holist\nstance.\n\nThere are three basic views within the debate:\n\n\nStrong methodological holism: Holist explanations alone\nshould be offered within the social sciences; they are indispensable.\nIndividualist explanations may, and should, be dispensed with.\n\nModerate methodological holism: In certain cases, holist\nexplanations should be advanced; in other cases individualist\nexplanations should be advanced; both holist and individualist\nexplanations are indispensable within the social sciences.\n\nMethodological individualism: Individualist explanations\nalone should be put forward within the social sciences; they are\nindispensable. Holist explanations may, and should, be dispensed\nwith.\n\n\nAmong these positions, the thesis of strong methodological holism has\nenjoyed relatively little support and today it has few, if any,\nproponents. The vast majority of methodological holists are of the\nmoderate variety. Accordingly, the debate has mainly played itself out\nbetween the moderate holist view and the individualist position.\nBecause both parties agree that individualist explanations should be\nadvanced, their efforts have first and foremost been directed toward\nthe question of whether holist explanations are indispensable or\nnot.\n\nThe three basic positions may be further characterized in three ways.\nFirst, each relies on a distinction between holist and individualist\nexplanations. This raises the issue of exactly how to differentiate\nbetween these two categories of explanation. The answer to this\nquestion is a matter of dispute among participants in the debate. One\npossible formulation of the distinction is that holist explanations\nappeal to social phenomena, whereas individualist explanations invoke\nindividuals, their actions, beliefs, etc. To elaborate further on this\nsuggestion, it may be specified that holist explanations contain\nsocial terms, descriptions, or predicates set apart by their reference\nto, and focus on, social phenomena. By contrast, individualist\nexplanations contain individualist terms, descriptions, or predicates\ndistinguished by their reference to, and focus on, individuals, their\nactions, beliefs, desires, etc.\n\nOne issue still left open by this supplementary characterization is\nhow to understand the notion of a social phenomenon. Methodological\nholists commonly take the following list of items to exemplify social\nphenomena: (a) Organizations\u2014like universities, firms, and\nchurches; (b) social processes\u2014like revolutions and economic\ngrowth; (c) statistical properties\u2014like the literacy rate or the\nsuicide rate within a group; (d) cultures and traditions\u2014like\nthe Mayan culture or a democratic tradition; (e) beliefs, desires, and\nother mental properties ascribed to groups\u2014like the\ngovernment\u2019s desire to stay in power; (f) norms and\nrules\u2014like the proscription of sex with family members and the\nrule requiring cars to drive on the right-hand side of the road; (g)\nproperties of social networks\u2014like their density or cohesion;\n(h) social structures, typically identified with one or more of the\nitems already listed; and (i) social roles\u2014like being a bus\ndriver or a nurse. The list includes social phenomena in the form of\nsocial entities, social processes, and social properties. The latter\nare first and foremost properties ascribed to social groups or\nconstellations of individuals. Yet social properties also include\ncertain features ascribed to individuals, such as an\nindividual\u2019s social role. These properties are social\nproperties, it is sometimes suggested, because they presuppose the\nsocial organization of individuals, or the existence of social\nentities. (For a discussion of different kinds of social properties,\nsee also Ylikoski 2012, 2014.)\n\nMethodological individualists typically disagree that all the items\nlisted above constitute social phenomena. They contend that some\nexemplify individualist properties because they are properties of\nindividuals. For instance, some methodological individualists maintain\nthat norms and rules are individualist properties since they express\nindividuals\u2019 beliefs as to how they should\u2014or should\nnot\u2014act. Likewise, many hold that social roles are individualist\nproperties because they are ascribed to individuals. (For holist\ndefenses of the view that social roles should be classified as social\nproperties, see e.g., Kincaid 1997; Lukes 1968; Elder-Vass 2010;\nHodgson 2007.) In this fashion, the dispute about how to distinguish\nbetween holist and individualist explanations translates into a\ndifference in opinion concerning what constitutes social phenomena.\nMethodological holists consider more phenomena to be social and hence\nthey classify more explanations as holist, whereas methodological\nindividualists view fewer phenomena as social, the result being that\nthey categorize fewer explanations as holist and more as\nindividualist. Due to such disagreements, methodological holists and\nindividualists often talk past one another: each offers arguments\npresupposing a distinction between holist and individualist\nexplanations that is at odds with that relied upon by their opponent\n(see Zahle 2003, 2014).\n\nThe question of how to differentiate between holist and individualist\nexplanations may also be approached by drawing on the analysis of\nexplanations as consisting of an explanans, i.e., what does the\nexplaining, and an explanandum, i.e., what is in need of explanation.\nConsider the following options: (a) both the explanans and the\nexplanandum are expressed in terms of social phenomena (e.g., the\ngovernment\u2019s decision to lower the national minimum wage led to\nprotests from the unions); (b) the explanans is stated in terms of\nsocial phenomena while the explanandum is described in terms of\nindividuals, their actions, etc. (e.g., the government\u2019s\ndecision to lower the national minimum wage resulted in several\nindividuals writing public letters of protest); (c) both the explanans\nand the explanandum are expressed in terms of individuals, their\nactions, etc. (e.g., because the small children started crying, a\nnumber of people came over to help out); (d) the explanans is stated\nin terms of individuals, their actions, etc. while the explanandum is\ndescribed in terms of social phenomena (e.g., the fact that many\nindividuals withdrew their money at once had the result that the bank\nexhausted its cash reserves). With these options in mind, three\ndifferent ways of circumscribing holist and individualist explanations\nmay be registered:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u2013\nHolist explanations: The explanans is stated in terms of\nsocial phenomena; the explanandum is expressed either in terms of\nsocial phenomena, or in terms of individuals, their actions, etc.\n\u2013\nIndividualist explanations: The explanans is stated in\nterms of individuals; the explanandum is expressed either in terms of\nsocial phenomena, or in terms of individuals, their actions, etc.\n \n(2)\n\n\n\u2013\nHolist explanations: The explanans is stated in terms of\nsocial phenomena; the explanandum is described in terms of social\nphenomena.\n\u2013\nIndividualist explanations: The explanans is stated in\nterms of individuals, their actions, etc.; the explanandum is\ndescribed in terms of social phenomena.\n \n(3)\n\n\n\u2013\nHolist explanations: The explanans is stated in terms of\nsocial phenomena; the explanandum is expressed in terms of social\nphenomena.\n\u2013\nIndividualist explanations: The explanans is stated in\nterms of individuals, their actions, etc.; the explanandum is\nexpressed in terms of individuals, their actions, etc.\n \n\n\nAll three conceptions have been advocated in the dispensability\ndebate. Among them, the first position is the most inclusive, while\nalso being the most widespread.\n\nSecond, the basic positions of strong methodological holism, moderate\nmethodological holism and methodological individualism can be further\ncharacterized by noting that holist and individualist explanations may\nbe categorized into different types. For instance, both holist and\nindividualist explanations may be classified according to whether they\nare functional, intentional, or straightforward causal explanations.\nThis point may be illustrated in relation to holist explanations.\nHolist explanations of the functional variety state that the continued\nexistence of a social phenomenon is explained by its function or\neffect. For instance, it may be suggested that \u201cthe state\ncontinues to exist because it furthers the interests of the ruling\nclass\u201d. In the past, but no longer today, methodological holism\nhas often been associated with the advancement of holist explanations\nof this type. (On the use of functional holist explanations, see e.g.,\nMacdonald and Pettit 1981: 131ff.) Intentional holist explanations\npurport to explain an action ascribed to a group by reference to the\ngroup\u2019s reasons for performing it. For example, it may be\naffirmed that \u201cthe government decided to call a general election\nin May because it believed this would increase its chances of being\nreelected\u201d. (On the use of intentional holist explanations, see\ne.g., Tollefsen 2002; List and Pettit 2011.) Nowadays, both functional\nand intentional explanations are often regarded as special kinds of\ncausal explanation to be distinguished from more straightforward\ncausal explanations. This latter kind of causal explanation is\nillustrated by assertions such as \u201cthe rise in unemployment led\nto an increase in crime\u201d, or \u201cthe government\u2019s\nlowering of the taxes led to an increase in the consumption of luxury\ngoods\u201d.\n\nAlternatively, to note an additional example, holist and individualist\nexplanations may be categorized by reference to their focus. In this\nspirit, holist explanations may be classified according to whether\nthey focus on, say, the statistical properties of social groups, on\nsocial organizations and their actions, and so on. Likewise,\nindividualist explanations may be categorized according to whether,\nsay, their descriptions of individuals are informed by rational choice\nmodels, by accounts that stress how actions are largely habitual and\nbased on various forms of tacit knowledge, etc. The advocacy of a\nbasic position may go together with the favoring of certain types of\nholist or individualist explanations over others.\n\nThird, the positions of strong methodological holism, moderate\nmethodological holism and methodological individualism can be further\nexplicated by observing that each stance may either be formulated as a\nclaim about explanations in general, that is, all explanations\nadvanced within the social sciences, or as pertaining to final\nexplanations only, that is, explanations that are satisfactory rather\nthan being merely tolerable in the absence of better ones. Sometimes\nmethodological individualists tend to regard the discussion as\nrevolving solely around final explanations. Accordingly, they maintain\nthat though holist explanations may be advanced, they are only\ntolerable as stopping points that are temporarily acceptable in\nanticipation of individualist explanations that, alone, will qualify\nas final explanations. Among both strong and moderate methodological\nholists, it is less commonly maintained that the debate concerns final\nexplanations only.\n\nThere are additional dimensions along which the three basic positions\nwithin the dispensability debate may be clarified. For instance, each\nstance is compatible with different views of what constitutes an\nexplanation, different notions of causation, and so on. Occasionally,\nthe divergence of opinion with respect to these issues will surface in\nthe discussion that follows.\n2. Why Holist Explanations are Indispensable\n\nThis section examines some of the most important arguments offered in\nsupport of the claim that holist explanations are indispensable within\nthe social sciences. All the arguments have been advocated by moderate\nmethodological holists. Only the first version of the first argument\nhas also, and perhaps mainly, been propounded by strong methodological\nholists. The arguments should all be read as defenses of the\nindispensability of holist explanations understood as final\nexplanations.\n2.1 The Argument from Social Phenomena as Causes\n\nThe argument from social phenomena as causes takes it that holist\nexplanations are indispensable if social phenomena are causally\neffective. The basic structure of the argument is as follows. First, a\ncharacterization of social phenomena as causally effective is\npresented. Next, it is maintained that in order to explain the events\ngenerated by the causally effective social phenomena, holist\nexplanations must be offered: holist explanations alone state how\nsocial phenomena bring about certain events. Lastly, it is concluded\nthat since the events brought about by social phenomena should not be\nleft unexplained, holist explanations are indispensable. The argument\ncomes in various versions set apart by the way in which they\ncharacterize social phenomena as causally effective.\n\nAccording to one line of reasoning, social entities like nations and\nsocieties have causal powers that are independent of, and override,\nthe causal powers of the individuals who comprise these entities. For\ninstance, it is held that nations develop in such a way so as to\nrealize some goal, yet without the implicated individuals having any\ninfluence on this development. Alternatively, it is contended that\nsocietal structures may ensure that individuals perform certain\nfunctions in society; the individuals have no choice in this matter.\nHowever specified, social phenomena that have these independent and\noverriding causal powers produce effects that cannot be accounted for\nby offering individualist explanations; individuals are simply not\ncausally responsible for these effects. The explanation of such social\nphenomena is only possible by way of holist explanations that lay out\nhow the phenomena brought about the effects in question.\n\nThe contention that social entities have independent and overriding\ncausal powers is often ascribed to Comte, Hegel, Marx, and their\nfollowers. Today the claim enjoys very few adherents. One important\nreason for this is that the claim is regarded as incompatible with the\nwidely held view that social phenomena are noncausally determined by\nindividuals and their properties, and sometimes by material artifacts\ntoo. Particularly since the 1980s, the notions of supervenience,\nrealization, and emergence have received a lot of attention as ways of\nspelling out this non-causal dependency relation between social\nphenomena, on the one hand, and individuals and their properties, on\nthe other. These notions have served as the basis for alternative\nversions of the argument from social phenomena as causes.\n\nConsider first the notions of supervenience and realization.\nSupervenience is a relationship between properties, kinds, or facts.\nRoughly speaking, social properties supervene upon individualist\nproperties if and only if there can be no change at the level of\nsocial properties unless there is also a change at the level of\nindividualist properties. Otherwise put, the individualist properties\nfix the social properties. Too see how this works, assume that a\nfootball club supervenes on a constellation of individuals with\ncertain beliefs, bearing certain relations to each other, and so on.\nThis being the case, the football club cannot transform into a golf\nclub, say, unless the individuals change some of their beliefs, the\nrelations they stand in, or the like. The individuals\u2019 beliefs,\nrelations, etc. fix the property of their being a football club. The\nnotion of supervenience is often used interchangeably with the notion\nof realization. Thus, it is said that a constellation of individuals\nwith certain beliefs, relationships, etc. realizes the property of\nbeing a football club. Several moderate methodological holists have,\nin varying ways, expanded on the account of social properties as\nsupervenient properties by presenting considerations in support of\nsupervenient social properties being, in certain cases, causally\neffective properties (see e.g., Kincaid 1997, 2009; List and\nSpiekermann 2013; Sawyer 2003, 2005). Their reflections are a response\nto the so-called exclusion argument, which states that supervenient\nproperties are epiphenomenal because all the causal work is done by\nthe properties that they supervene upon (on this argument, see e.g.,\nKim 2005). Here is how Christian List and Kai Spiekermann purport to\nestablish that some supervenient social properties are causally\neffective (List and Spiekermann 2013).\n\nList and Spiekermann begin by appealing to the difference-making or\ncounterfactual conception of causation, which asserts that \u201ca\nproperty C (within a system of interest) is the cause of\nanother property E if and only if C systematically\nmakes a difference to E\u201d (2013: 636). By implication, a\nsupervenient social property, S, qualifies as a cause of\nE, when S makes a systematic difference to\nE. This means that, other things being equal, if S\noccurred E would do so too, and that if S did not\noccur, then neither would E. Now assume that S is\nmicrorealization-robust: S would also have brought about\nE if it had been realized by a compound of individualist\nproperties other than the one that actually realizes it. In situations\nof this sort, the compound of individualist properties that realizes\nS does not make a systematic difference to E. While\nit is the case that if the particular compound occurred then so would\nE, it is not the case that if the compound did not occur,\nE would not occur either. Hence it is S, rather than\nthe compound of individualist properties realizing S, that\nqualifies as the cause of E. List and Spiekermann underline\nthat in these circumstances, a holist explanation\u2014that is, an\nexplanation describing how a given supervenient social property\nbrought about some effect\u2014is needed.\n\nAs an anecdotal illustration of these points, they refer to the failed\nclimate summit in Copenhagen in 2010 (2013: 637). They suggest that\nthe summit failed at least in part because there were so many parties,\nand no common interest. Moreover, they note that these\u2014and\nother\u2014social properties of the situation are\nmicrorealization-robust: even had they been realized by individuals\nwith somewhat different individualist properties, the social\nproperties would have still resulted in a failed summit. The social\nproperties of the meeting should thus be regarded as the cause of the\nfailure; that is, a holist explanation must be offered in order to\nexplain why the summit was unsuccessful.\n\nTurn now to the notion of emergence. While emergent properties are\nsometimes regarded as identical to, or as a special class of,\nsupervenient properties, emergent properties may also be differently\ncharacterized. These alternative specifications of social properties\nas emergent properties have similarly served as the basis for\ninsisting that holist explanations are indispensable. Currently, this\nline of reasoning is often associated with the social scientific\nschool of Critical Realism, founded by Roy Bhaskar and further\ndeveloped by many others (see e.g., Archer 1995, 2000; Bhaskar 1979,\n1982; Elder-Vass 2007, 2010, 2014). Main representatives of the\nmovement have offered a variety of specifications of the notion of\nemergence. Among these, Dave Elder-Vass\u2019 account will be briefly\ndiscussed.\n\nAccording to Elder-Vass, social entities like firms and universities\nare composed of individuals (and sometimes material things as well)\nthat stand in certain relations to one another (Elder-Vass 2007: 31).\nIn virtue of being composed, at a given moment in time, of\ninterrelated individuals, social entities have various causally\neffective social properties. Most notably, they have emergent social\nproperties, of which there are two kinds. The first is constituted by\nemergent social properties that are ascribed to social entities as\nwholes. These are exemplified by a government\u2019s power to\nintroduce a new tax, or a quartet\u2019s ability to deliver a\nharmonized performance. The second kind consists in emergent social\nproperties that are ascribed to individuals. These are illustrated by\na boss\u2019s power to hire or fire employees. Individuals have these\nproperties in virtue of being interrelated so as to form a social\nentity, and that\u2019s why they constitute emergent social\nproperties (Elder-Vass 2010: 74). Individuals who form part of social\nentities have non-emergent properties too. These are the causally\neffective properties, like the ability to read or talk, which\nindividuals have independently of being, at a given moment in time,\npart of a social entity. From these reflections, Elder-Vass contends,\nit follows that holist explanations cannot be dispensed with. The\neffects of emergent social properties should be explained. To this\nend, it is necessary to offer holist explanations\u2014that is,\nexplanations that state how a social property partially brought about\nsome effect. Individualist explanations are not up to this task\ninasmuch as they are confined to describing how individuals, in virtue\nof their non-emergent properties, partially brought about some effect.\nSimply pointing to the properties that individuals have independently\nof being, at a given moment in time, part of social entities, does not\nadd up to an explanation of the effects of emergent social properties\n(see 2010: 66).\n\nContemporary moderate methodological holists largely agree that social\nphenomena are non-causally determined by individuals and their\nproperties, and occasionally by material artifacts too. As illustrated\nin the foregoing, some defend the claim that thus conceived, social\nphenomena are causally effective, while such defenses often depend\nheavily on the particular notion of causation espoused. Many moderate\nmethodological holists, however, see no need for arguments in support\nof social phenomena being causally effective. They simply assume this\nto be the case while pursuing alternative strategies in the attempt to\nestablish that holist explanations are indispensable.\n2.2 The Argument from the Impossibility of Translation\n\nThe argument from the impossibility of translation takes it that the\nindispensability of holist explanations is a matter of these\nexplanations being untranslatable into individualist explanations. The\nargument begins by observing that holist explanations contain social\ndescriptions or concepts, and goes on to note that the meaning of\nsocial descriptions cannot be captured by specifications that contain\ndescriptions of individuals alone. Or, put otherwise, social concepts\nare not reductively definable solely in terms of individualist\nconcepts. As a result, it is impossible to translate holist\nexplanations into individualist ones: holist explanations cannot be\nreplaced by individualist explanations through translation. Finally,\nthe argument concludes that since the events accounted for by holist\nexplanations should not go unexplained holist explanations are\nindispensable.\n\nThe argument from the impossibility of translation is famously\npresented by Maurice Mandelbaum in a paper from 1955 (Mandelbaum\n1955). Here Mandelbaum defines social concepts as concepts that refer\nto forms of organization within a society. He remarks that concepts of\nthis sort \u201ccannot be translated into psychological [i.e.,\nindividualist] concepts without remainder\u201d (1955:\n310\u2014italics in the original). In order to drive this point home,\nMandelbaum considers the social concept of a bank teller. In order to\nspecify what a bank teller is, it is necessary to invoke the social\nconcept of a bank. The definition of a \u201cbank\u201d, in turn,\nmust contain social concepts such as \u201clegal tender\u201d and\n\u201ccontract\u201d. And these social concepts, too, can only be\ndefined in ways that involve yet other social concepts, such that the\ndefinition of a social concept inevitably contains other social\nconcepts. Given that the distinctive feature of holist explanations is\ntheir very containment of social concepts, these explanations can thus\nnot be translated into, and as such replaced by, individualist\nexplanations.\n\nMandelbaum\u2019s argument, including his example of the bank teller,\nis widely cited in subsequent contributions to the debate between\nmoderate methodological holists and individualists (see e.g., Bhargava\n1992; Danto 1973 [1962]; Epstein 2015; Gellner 1973 [1956]; Goldstein\n1973b [1958]; James 1984; Kincaid 1986, 1997; Zahle 2003). However,\nfew moderate methodological holists have followed Mandelbaum in\nholding that holist explanations are indispensable if they indeed\ncannot be translated into individualist explanations.\n2.3 The Argument from the Impossibility of Intertheoretic Reduction\n\nThe argument from the impossibility of intertheoretic reduction\npresumes that holist explanations cannot be dispensed with if holist\ntheories are irreducible to individualist ones. The argument rests on\nthe view that holist explanations draw on social theories, whereas\nindividualist explanations involve individualist theories. From within\nthis context, it is argued that social theories are oftentimes\nirreducible to, and hence irreplaceable by, individualist theories.\nAccordingly, when holist explanations make use of irreducible social\ntheories, they cannot be substituted by individualist explanations\nthat appeal to individualist theories. Since the events that are\nexplained by appeal to irreducible social theories should not go\nunexplained, holist explanations are therefore indispensable.\n\nTypically, discussions of the argument rely on some version of the\nNagelian model of intertheoretic reduction. The model conceives of\ntheories as statements issued mainly in the form of laws. Adapted to\nthe present focus, it requires that two conditions be fulfilled in\norder to reduce a social theory to an individualist one. The first\nrequirement is the condition of connectability, which must be met\nbecause it is assumed that holist theories are distinguished by their\nuse of social predicates or descriptions, whereas individualist\ntheories are characterized by containing individualist predicates or\ndescriptions only. Following one common interpretation, the condition\nstates that the social predicates in the social theory to-be-reduced\nmust be linked, on a one-to-one basis, to individualist descriptions\nin the reducing individualist theory. The resulting bridge laws, as\nthey are called, express that the linked descriptions are\nco-extensive, that is, that they have the same reference, in a\nlaw-like manner. (Note that this is a weaker condition than the demand\nconsidered in\n 2.2,\n requiring that the meaning of social terms must be captured by\nspecifications that contain descriptions of individuals only.) The\ncondition of connectability implies that if, say, the social term\n\u201cchurch\u201d occurs in the social theory to-be-reduced, then\nit must be demonstrated that this term is co-extensive, in a law-like\nmanner, with a single individualist description of individuals and\ntheir properties as realizing a church. Once this condition has been\nmet, the second requirement, the condition of derivability, should be\nfulfilled. It states that the social theory to-be-reduced must be\ndeduced from, and in that sense explained by, the reducing\nindividualist theory, plus the bridge laws.\n\nModerate methodological holists have primarily focused on\ndemonstrating that social theories cannot be reduced to individualist\ntheories because of difficulties that relate to meeting the\nrequirement of connectability. The most prominent argument to this\neffect is the argument from multiple realization (other arguments\ninclude, e.g., Kincaid 1996, Wahlberg 2019). The argument from\nmultiple realization originates from within philosophy of mind, from\nwhence it was developed into a generalizable argument against\nintertheoretic reduction (see Putnam 1967 and Fodor 1974). In the\n1980s, it began to appear as an argument against the possibility of\nreducing social to individualist theories (see e.g., Kincaid 1986,\n1996, 1997; Little 1991; Rios 2005; Sawyer 2002, 2005, Wright et al.\n1992; Tollefsen 2002, 2015).\n\nThe argument begins by noting that social properties supervene on, or\nare realized by, individualist properties. It is then pointed out that\nthis relationship between social and individualist properties is\ncompatible with social properties being realizable not only by a\nsingle compound of individualist properties, but by different\u2014in\nfact indefinitely many\u2014compounds of individualist properties. An\nempirical claim is made next, asserting that many social properties\nare indeed multiply realizable. This point is typically supported by\nway of example. For instance, Kincaid lists several social predicates\nsuch as \u201crevolution\u201d, \u201cbureaucracy\u201d, and\n\u201cpeer group\u201d, and remarks that \u201cany number of\ndifferent relations between individuals, individual psychological\nstates, beliefs, etc. could realize the referent of these terms\u201d\n(Kincaid 1986: 497). In a similar vein, Keith Sawyer states that\n\u201c\u2018being a church\u2019 could be realized in disjunctive\n[and hence multiple] ways in different cultures and social\ngroups\u201d (Sawyer 2002: 550). Finally, it is observed that the\ncondition of connectability cannot be met whenever social theories\ncontain social predicates that refer to social properties that have\nmultiple and highly different, or indefinitely many, realizations. In\nthese cases, the social predicates cannot be linked via bridge laws to\nsingle individualist descriptions. Instead, they will have to be\nlinked to a disjunction of individualist descriptions. To see this,\nreturn to the example of the social property of being a church.\nInsofar as a church is multiply realizable, the term\n\u201cchurch\u201d will have to be linked up with a disjunction of\nindividualist descriptions, each characterizing a possible compound of\nindividualist properties that may realize a church. The upshot is that\nsocial theories that refer to multiply realizable social properties\ncannot be reduced to individualist theories. Thus, holist explanations\nthat appeal to these theories cannot be substituted by individualist\nexplanations.\n\nWithin recent discussions in the philosophy of science, the Nagelian\nmodel of intertheoretic reduction has been criticized on a number of\ngrounds that likewise challenge its suitability as a model of\nreduction in the context of the dispensability debate. Insofar as the\nmodel is deemed inadequate, arguments in favor of the indispensability\nof holist explanations that rest on this model lose their\nsignificance.\n2.4 The Argument from Explanatory Regress\n\nThe argument from explanatory regress focuses on the tenability of a\nstandard reason for holding that holist explanations should be\ndispensed with. The standard reason in question is the following.\nGiven that holist explanations focus on larger units in the form of\nsocial entities and processes, they are less preferable than\nindividualist explanations that zero in on the components of these\nlarger units, viz. individuals, their actions, etc. The argument from\nexplanatory regress states that this claim may likewise be used to\njustify the contention that individualist explanations are less\npreferable than explanations that focus on the biological components\nof individuals. The claim may be further used to motivate the\nassertion that these explanations, too, should be dismissed in favor\nof explanations that concentrate on the chemical components of\nindividuals\u2019 biological units, and so on. To avoid this\nundesirable consequence, the argument continues, the standard reason\nfor holding that holist explanations are always less preferable than\nindividualist ones should be dismissed. Accordingly, since explanatory\npractices should not be changed unless there are good reasons to do\nso, the existing practice of offering holist explanations should not\nbe discontinued. From the perspective of carrying on existing\nexplanatory practices, holist explanations are indispensable.\n\nConsiderations of this sort have been presented by a number of\ntheorists (see e.g., Hodgson 2007; Jackson and Pettit 1992a; Jones\n1996; Tannsj\u00f6 1990). It should be noted that the regress argument\nmakes a purely negative point in that it offers no guidance as to\nwhen\u2014and why\u2014holist explanations are indispensable in the\nsocial sciences as they are currently practiced. In this respect, the\nargument differs from the others considered in this section.\n2.5 The Argument from Differing Explanatory Interests\n\nThe argument from differing explanatory interests asserts that holist\nexplanations are indispensable insofar as they are capable of\nsatisfying explanatory interests that are distinct from the interests\nthat individualist explanations are able to satisfy. The argument has\nthe following basic structure. First, it is made clear that a certain\nnotion of explanation is adopted. By appeal to this notion, it is then\nargued that some holist explanations may serve explanatory interests\nthat cannot be satisfied by individualist explanations. It is\nconcluded that since the social sciences should satisfy these\nexplanatory interests, holist explanations are indispensable.\n\nThe argument has mainly been advanced since the early 1980s. One\ncommon version of it relies on the erothetic model of explanation,\naccording to which an explanation is an answer to a why-question. It\nhas been presented by Alan Garfinkel, and subsequently by other\ntheorists as well (see e.g., Garfinkel 1981; Haslanger 2016, 2018;\nKincaid 1996, 1997; Risjord 2000; Weber and Van Bouwel 2002). The\nprincipal point made is that some why-questions can only be adequately\nanswered by offering holist explanations. Consequently, since an\ninterest in answers to these why-questions should be met, holist\nexplanations are indispensable. Another well-known version of the\nargument from differing explanatory interests relies on the causal\ninformation view of explanation. It states that an explanation\nprovides information about the causal process leading to the event in\nneed of explanation. The key idea is that some information can only be\nprovided via holist explanations. Since an interest in this\ninformation should be satisfied, holist explanations are thus\nindispensable. This version of the argument has been presented by\nFrank Jackson and Philip Pettit (see Jackson and Pettit 1992a, 1992b;\nfor a comparison of the erothetic and the causal information view of\nexplanation, see Marchionni 2007). Their influential account will be\nexamined in more detail.\n\nEquipped with the causal information view of explanation, Jackson and\nPettit consider the explaining of particular events (Jackson and\nPettit 1992a). A holist explanation provides information about the\nmanner in which the instantiation of a social property, S,\nresulted in a certain event. Now, due to social properties being\nsupervenient on individualist ones, it is always possible to offer a\ncorresponding individualist explanation of the same event: the\nindividualist explanation offers information as to how the individuals\nwho realized S produced the event in question. For example,\nassume that the particular event in need of explanation is a rise in\ncrime. Here, the holist explanation might be that the rise in crime\nwas the result of a rise in unemployment, whereas the individualist\nexplanation might state that the crime rate went up because individual\na, b, c, etc. lost their jobs, and felt\nfrustrated about having little money and no job opportunities.\n\nThe key claim made by Jackson and Pettit is that these two\nexplanations provide different information. The holist explanation\nconveys that given the rise in unemployment, an increase in crime was\nalmost bound to occur. The reason is that\n\n\nhad the motivations and opportunities of those particular individuals\nnot changed, the motivations of others would have done so. (1992a:\n11)\n\n\nThus the holist explanation provides modally comparative information,\nthat is, information that brings out that what happened in the actual\nworld would also have taken place in a variety of possible worlds. By\ncontrast, the individualist explanation confines itself to pointing\nout that these particular individuals, with their changed job\nsituations and altered motivations, were responsible for the rise in\ncrime. As such, it offers modally contrastive information, that is,\ninformation that sets the actual world apart from other possible\nworlds. Because of this divergence in the information provided,\nJackson and Pettit conclude that holist explanations are\nindispensable. Unlike individualist explanations, holist explanations\nmay satisfy an explanatory interest in modally comparative\ninformation, and an interest in this sort of information should be\nmet.\n\nJackson and Pettit\u2019s version of the argument from differing\nexplanatory interests has been criticized for not taking into account\nthat pragmatic considerations may determine whether the information\nprovided by a holist explanation is considered to be of more\u2014or\nless\u2014interest than that offered by an individualist explanation\n(see Weber and Van Bouwel 2002). The idea that pragmatic\nconsiderations have a role to play is given center stage in the\nargument from pragmatic concerns.\n2.6 The Argument from Pragmatic Concerns\n\nThe argument from pragmatic concerns states that whether holist\nexplanations are indispensable is a matter of whether they are\npragmatically preferable to individualist explanations. The argument\nrests on the assumption that whenever a holist explanation of an event\nis possible, an individualist explanation of that same event is\nlikewise feasible. It is claimed that the choice between these two\nexplanations should be made by appeal to pragmatic considerations. It\nis maintained, moreover, that it is sometimes preferable from a\npragmatic perspective to offer a holist, rather than an individualist\nexplanation. On this basis, it is concluded that holist explanations\nare indispensable.\n\nAn argument along these lines has been offered by Jones (1996). He\nnotes that it is sometimes less costly to establish a holist rather\nthan an individualist explanation of some event (1996: 126). What he\nlikely has in mind is that gathering evidence about individuals, their\ndoings, intentions, etc. with the aim of offering an individualist\nexplanation may take more time, and hence come with a higher monetary\ncost, than producing the evidence needed to advance a holist\nexplanation. Jones additionally asserts that a holist explanation is\nsometimes easier to teach: because holist explanations tend to be\nsimpler in that they do not include an abundance of detail about\nindividuals, their doings, beliefs, etc. (1996), they may be easier\nfor individuals to grasp. In these sorts of situations, Jones contends\nthat holist explanations are preferable to individualist ones: in view\nof pragmatic concerns like those outlined above, holist explanations\nare indispensable.\n3. The Microfoundations Debate\n\nThe microfoundations debate gained prominence around the beginning of\nthe 1980s when a number of philosophers and social scientists began to\ndefend the view that purely holist explanations, as they may be\ntermed, should be supplemented by an account of the underlying\nindividual-level mechanisms. Jon Elster and Daniel Little, among\nothers, argued in favor of this view in the context of Marxist social\ntheorizing (Elster 1983, 1985, 1989; Little 1986, 1991, 1998). Raymond\nBoudon was also an early and important proponent (Boudon 1976, 1979).\nTheir contention that social theorists must pay attention to\nindividual-level microfoundations was soon met by opposition from\nmethodological holists, and a debate developed. Within current\nphilosophical discussions, the advocacy of the methodological\nindividualist stance is often associated with the approach of\nanalytical sociology or with key representatives thereof\n(Hedstr\u00f6m 2005; Hedstr\u00f6m and Swedberg 1996; Demeulenaere\n2011). Yet the view is also defended by others, both from within and\noutside sociology. Arguments in support of the opposing holist stance\nare not tied to any specific approach within the social sciences or\nphilosophy.\n\nThere are two basic positions within the microfoundations debate:\n\n\nMethodological holism: Purely holist explanations may\nsometimes stand on their own; they need not always be supplemented by\naccounts of the underlying individual-level microfoundations.\n\nMethodological individualism: Purely holist explanations may\nnever stand on their own; they should always be supplemented by\naccounts of the underlying individual-level microfoundations.\n\n\nThe debate may be further characterized by considering its key\nnotions, possible qualifications of the individualist stance, and the\nstandard motivation behind the demand for microfoundations.\n\nTo begin, purely holist explanations are ones in which both the\nexplanans and the explanandum are expressed in terms of social\nphenomena. They are exemplified by claims such as \u201cthe\nprotestant ethic caused the rise of capitalism in Western\nEurope\u201d, or \u201cthe country\u2019s high economic growth was\npartly due to its stable political environment\u201d. Drawing on the\ndiscussion of holist explanations in connection with the\ndispensability debate, the explanans and explanandum may be said to be\nin terms of social phenomena when they contain social terms,\ndescriptions, or predicates set apart by their reference to, and focus\non, social phenomena. In turn, social phenomena may then be specified\nas social entities, social processes and social properties as\nexemplified by universities, revolutions, the literacy rate, and so\non. Moreover, it is possible to distinguish between different types of\npurely holist explanation. For instance, purely holist explanations\nmay be classified according to whether they are of the functional,\nintentional, or straightforward causal type, as introduced above. Or,\npurely holist explanations may be individuated according to their\nfocus on, say, organizations, the statistical properties of groups,\netc.\n\nTurn now to the accounts of the individual-level microfoundations.\nThese are specifications of the underlying individual-level mechanisms\nunderstood as causal chains of events, that occur at the level of\nindividuals, and that link some cause in the form of a social\nphenomenon to its effect in the form of another social phenomenon.\nVery often, accounts of this sort are taken to consist of three parts.\nPart I lays out how a social phenomenon resulted in individuals\nforming various beliefs and desires, and having certain opportunities.\nPart II states how these beliefs, desires, and opportunities gave rise\nto individuals acting and interacting in a certain manner. Part III\noutlines how these actions and interactions, intentionally or\nunintentionally, brought about a certain social phenomenon. As an\nillustration of an account along these lines, consider the example of\nthe purely holist explanation that \u201cthe protestant ethic caused\nthe rise of capitalism in the West\u201d. A very rough three-part\naccount of the underlying individual-level mechanisms might go as\nfollows. The protestant ethic compelled individuals to adopt certain\nvalues. These, in turn, induced them to engage in certain new forms of\neconomic behavior. Those, finally, caused the rise of capitalism in\nthe West. Frequently, Coleman\u2019s well-known boat model is used to\ndepict how purely holist explanations must include such three-part\naccounts of the underlying individual-level mechanisms (Coleman 1986,\n1990). The model uses a boat form to illustrate the move from one\nsocial phenomenon down to individual-level events and up again to\nanother social phenomenon.\n\nAs may already be clear, the accounts of the underlying mechanisms are\nindividual-level accounts in the sense that they invariably contain\ndescriptions of what happens to, and what is made to happen by,\nindividuals. It is standard to invoke descriptions of individuals by\nreference to their roles and other properties they possess as a result\nof being part of social organizations. In this sense, a permissive\nnotion as to what counts as individual-level descriptions is endorsed.\nThe accounts of individuals may draw on different theories of the\nactor. In earlier phases of the debate, there was a clear tendency to\nbase the accounts on rational-choice models. Today, other models are\nused as well.\n\nThe claim that purely holist explanations are in need of\nmicrofoundations may be qualified in various ways. Sometimes, it is\nmade clear that purely holist explanations should always be\naccompanied by accounts of the underlying individual-level mechanisms.\nVery often, this position is motivated by appeal to the\n\u201cmechanism model\u201d of explanation. It states that to\nexplain is to show how one phenomenon, via underlying mechanisms,\nbrought about another phenomenon; to borrow Elster\u2019s words, to\nexplain is \u201cto provide a mechanism, to open up the black box and\nshow the nuts and bolts, the cogs and wheels\u201d (Elster 1985: 5).\nAccordingly, purely holist explanations do not actually constitute\nexplanations unless they are supplemented by accounts of the\nunderlying individual-level mechanisms. In other instances, it is only\nheld that purely holist explanations must be supplemented by accounts\nof the underlying individual-level mechanisms in order to qualify as\nsatisfying or complete explanations. This view is\ncommonly motivated by a weaker version of the mechanism model of\nexplanation, according to which a satisfactory or complete\nexplanation, rather than an explanation as such, must describe how one\nphenomenon, via underlying mechanisms, brought about another.\n\nHowever qualified, the assertion that purely holist explanations are\nalways in need of microfoundations is a weaker form of methodological\nindividualism than the one defended within the indispensability\ndispute. Methodological individualists who are engaged in the\nmicrofoundations debate do not insist that holist explanations should\nbe dispensed with. The target is only purely holist explanations,\ni.e., ones in which both the explanans and the explanandum are\nexpressed in terms of social phenomena, and it is simply held that\nthese explanations are in need of supplementation by accounts of\nindividual-level mechanisms. Also, there is no objection to the use of\nholist explanations in which the explanans is stated in terms of\nsocial phenomena and the explanandum is described in terms of\nindividuals, their actions, etc. In fact, explanations along these\nlines are offered as part of the accounts of the individual-level\nmechanisms when it is specified how a social phenomenon resulted in\nindividuals forming various beliefs and desires, and having certain\nopportunities. Even though the demand for microfoundations is a weaker\nform of methodological individualism, the position has nonetheless met\nwith opposition. As noted, methodological holists who are engaged in\nthe microfoundations debate insist that purely holist explanations may\nsometimes stand on their own in that they need not be supplemented by\naccounts of the individual-level mechanisms; purely holist\nexplanations qualify as explanations, or as satisfying or complete\nexplanations.\n4. Why Purely Holist Explanations Can Sometimes Stand on Their Own\n\nMethodological holists have offered a number of arguments in support\nof the claim that purely holist explanations can sometimes stand on\ntheir own. In the following, some of their main arguments are\nexamined.\n4.1 The Argument from Underlying Social-Level Mechanisms\n\nThe argument from underlying social-level mechanisms purports to\nestablish that purely holist explanations may sometimes be accompanied\nby underlying social-level rather than individual-level mechanisms\n(see e.g., Kaidesoja 2013; Kincaid 1997: 111; Mayntz 2004; Vromen\n2010; Wan 2012; Ylikoski 2012).\n\nThe argument begins by noting that social phenomena are at a higher\nlevel of organization than individuals. Note that this is why accounts\nof individual-level mechanisms qualify as specifications of the\nunderlying mechanisms. What is sometimes overlooked, the\nargument continues, is that social phenomena may themselves be at\nhigher or lower levels of organization. For instance, a nation or a\nstate is typically at a higher level of organization than a small firm\nor a school. This observation paves the way for the contention that a\npurely holist explanation should sometimes be accompanied by an\naccount of the underlying mechanisms involving lower-level social\nphenomena. These explanations are still holist explanations.\nAccordingly, it is concluded, holist explanations may sometimes stand\non their own in that they do not need individual-level\nmicrofoundations.\n\nThe argument from underlying social-level mechanisms makes it plain\nthat the adoption of the mechanism model of explanation does not lend\nsupport to the view that purely holist explanations need always be\naccompanied by accounts of individual-level microfoundations. The\nmodel states that an explanation, or a satisfactory or complete\nexplanation, describes how one phenomenon, via underlying mechanisms,\nbrought about another phenomenon, and this is perfectly compatible\nwith accounts of the underlying mechanisms consisting in descriptions\nof mechanisms at the level of other (though lower-level) social\nphenomena. Thus the argument from underlying social-level mechanisms\ndoes not challenge the mechanism model of explanation. Other arguments\noffered by methodological holists, however, aim to do exactly\nthis.\n4.2 The Argument from Mechanism Regress\n\nThe argument from mechanism regress is directed at the mechanism model\nof explanation. The endorsement of this model is taken to support the\ninsistence that purely holist explanations must always be accompanied\nby accounts of the underlying individual-level mechanisms (see e.g.,\nVan Bouwel 2006; Norkus 2005; Kincaid 1997: 26; Opp 2005).\n\nThe starting point of the argument involves the observation that when\ntwo social phenomena are linked by a causal chain of events at the\nlevel of individuals, then these events are themselves connected by\nunderlying mechanisms involving events that are, in turn, linked by\nunderlying mechanisms, and so on. In this fashion, it is mechanisms\nall the way down until some physical bottom-level mechanisms are\nprobably reached. According to the argument from mechanism regress,\nthis point brings into view a problem faced by the mechanism model of\nexplanation. The model requires that the underlying mechanisms that\ncausally link two phenomena must be specified. Consequently, due to\nsocial phenomena being connected by underlying mechanisms that extend\nall the way down to some bottom physical level, the model seems to\nrequire that all such mechanisms be specified each time a purely\nholist explanation is offered. But, of course, this is an absurd\nrequirement, and so the mechanism view of explanation should be\nrejected. Without it, there is no longer any basis for holding that\npurely holist explanations can never stand on their own.\n4.3 The Argument from Explanatory Practices\n\nThe argument from explanatory practices likewise targets the mechanism\nview of explanation that is taken to underwrite the claim that purely\nholist explanations must be complemented by accounts of the underlying\nindividual-level mechanisms. The argument has been presented by\nKincaid, who observes that both in everyday and scientific contexts,\nwe offer explanations that lack specifications of the underlying\nmechanisms while still regarding these explanations as being perfectly\nacceptable (Kincaid 1997: 28). For instance, that a flying ball hit\nthe window is typically regarded as a successful explanation as to why\nthe window broke, even though no account of the underlying mechanisms\nis offered. This shows that our standard explanatory practices\nconflict with the mechanism model of explanation and, on this ground,\nthe model should be dismissed. If this is so, there is no longer any\nreason for holding that purely holist explanations must always be\naccompanied by accounts of the underlying individual-level\nmicrofoundations.\n\nThe argument from explanatory practices and the earlier argument from\nmechanism regress intend to reject the mechanism model of explanation,\nso that it cannot serve as justification for the claim that purely\nholist explanations can never stand on their own. This makes it\nnatural to wonder whether the demand for accounts of individual-level\nmicrofoundations may be upheld without appeal to this model of\nexplanation. This issue has also been addressed in the debate.\n4.4 The Argument from Non-Mechanistic Explanatory Considerations\n\nThe argument from non-mechanistic explanation purports to show that if\nnon-mechanistic considerations as to what constitutes an explanation\n(or at least a satisfactory or complete explanation) are adopted, then\npurely holist explanations may sometimes stand on their own.\n\nOne version of the argument takes as its starting point the erothetic\nmodel of explanation, according to which explanations are, roughly\nspeaking, answers to why-questions. Equipped with this model of\nexplanation, Jeroen Van Bouwel considers the contrastive question as\nto why the French Revolution broke out in 1789, and not in 1750 (Van\nBouwel 2006). Following Theda Skocpol\u2019s work, he suggests that\ncertain structural conditions made the revolution possible in 1789,\nand that these conditions were not present in 1750. In 1789, but not\nin 1750, the French state was economically weak because of the\nsubstantial resources that had gone into the American War of\nIndependence, and because of the growing economic competition with\nEngland. This contrastive explanation is expressed in purely holist\nterms. Moreover, Van Bouwel contends that it constitutes a perfectly\nsatisfactory\u2014and complete\u2014answer to the contrastive\nquestion. Adding an account of how the state\u2019s weakness led\nvarious individuals to adopt certain beliefs and desires, and to act\nin ways that ultimately led to the French Revolution, would not render\nthe explanation any better. Elaborating on this point, Van Bouwel\nconcludes that in response to contrastive questions, purely holist\nexplanations do not invariably need to be complemented by accounts of\nthe underlying individual-level mechanisms.\n\nAnother version of the argument has been offered by Julian Reiss, who\ndraws attention to the fact that two types of social phenomena may be\ncausally linked by many different types of underlying individual-level\nmechanisms (Reiss 2013: 111). As an illustration of this point, he\nnotes that an increase in the supply of currency tends to make prices\ngo up, and that this may happen via multiple types of underlying\nindividual-level mechanisms. Consequently, when faced with the task of\nexplaining a particular case of prices having gone up, there are two\noptions. One option is to appeal to the tendency of an increase in the\nmoney supply to make the prices go up; the other is to refer to this\ntendency while supplementing this with an account of the underlying\nindividual-level mechanisms. The point is that we may sometimes prefer\nexplanations that are applicable to a large number of individual\ncases, in which case we should opt for the purely holist explanation.\nIf an account of the underlying individual-level mechanisms is\nincluded, the explanation will not hold for all the cases in which the\nmechanisms are of a different type (2013: 114). Therefore, Reiss\nargues, it is not correct that purely holist explanations should\nalways be accompanied by accounts of the individual-level\nmicrofoundations; sometimes purely holist explanations may stand on\ntheir own.\n",
