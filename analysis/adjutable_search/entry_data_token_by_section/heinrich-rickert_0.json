    "main_text": "Southwestern Neo-Kantianism vs. Marburg Neo-Kantianism\n1. Southwestern Neo-Kantianism vs. Marburg Neo-Kantianism\n \n\nRickert is considered the head of the so-called Southwestern or\nBaden school of Neo-Kantianism, whose exponents worked in the\nphilosophy departments at Freiburg and Heidelberg, both in the region\nof Baden in southwestern Germany. The Southwestern school stands in\ncontrast to the so-called Marburg school, spearheaded by Hermann Cohen\n(1842\u20131918) and continued by Paul Natorp (1854\u20131924) and\nErnst Cassirer (1874\u20131945). (For an overview of the two schools\nsee Crowell 1999.)\n\n\nIn spite of their fierce opposition, the two schools present\nelements of similarity alongside the numerous elements of difference.\nThese have been recently debated among Neo-Kantianism scholars (Krijnen\n2001, 77\u201393; Krijnen/Noras 2012). One indisputably common element\nbetween the two schools is the preoccupation with the problem of\nvalidity, or Geltung, which is arguably the systematic core of\nNeo-Kantianism in general (Krijnen 2001, 84). Philosophy for the\nNeo-Kantians is concerned with the systematic elucidation of the a\npriori principles that allow for valid thinking in various\nspheres of knowledge. In keeping with Kant\u2019s first\nCritique, valid thinking is not merely logically consistent\nthinking. Valid thinking requires, over and above the adherence to the\nlaws of formal logic, thinking in accordance with the a priori\nprinciples governing the intelligibility of a given area of reality.\nThese will be, for instance, the principles of causality,\nsubstantiality etc. in the sphere of physical nature and principles\nsuch as good and evil, responsibility, freedom, etc. in the sphere of\nethics. It is the task of philosophy to identify these a priori\nprinciples in all the different spheres of culture, including politics,\nbiology, art, history, etc. Helmuth Plessner captures metaphorically\nthe spirit of Neo-Kantianism when he characterizes the Neo-Kantians as\n\u201cbotanists in the garden of the a priori\u201d (Plessner 1974,\n185).\n\n\nIn their attempt to clarify the way in which we should think of such\nprinciples, both the Southwestern and the Marburg Neo-Kantians reject\nany kind of psychological reading, which dominated among early\n19th Century interpretations of Kant. The a priori\nprinciples of valid thinking are not mere facts about human psychology;\nthey do not describe merely how our mind happens to function. Their\nvalidity is objective, that is, it is part of the formal\nstructure of the objects of investigation and not merely an extrinsic\nmental scheme that exemplars of the species homo sapiens\ncontingently apply to them.\n\n\nMoreover, both schools were rather unenthusiastic about the label\n\u2018Neo-Kantianism\u2019. Their goal was not to go \u201cback to\nKant\u201d, as Otto Liebmann (1840\u20131912) famously urged philosophers\nto do in his Kant und die Epigonen (Liebmann 1865), but,\nrather, to move forward beyond Kant building on his original views.\nWindelband, Rickert\u2019s mentor and the forefather of Southwestern\nNeo-Kantianism, pronounced: \u201cTo understand Kant means to move\nbeyond him\u201d (Windelband 1915, IV). Likewise, the Marburg school\nleader Cohen pointed out: \u201cFrom the very beginning I was\nconcerned with developing Kant\u2019s system further\u201d (Cohen\n1902, VII).\n\n\nThe two schools, however, diverge significantly in their\ninterpretation of Kant. While the Marburg school was predominantly\ninterested in the Critique of Pure Reason (Cohen 1885) and\nconsidered it to be an essay in the philosophical foundation of\nNewtonian science (a reading that is still prominent among contemporary\nKant scholars, such as Friedmann 1992), Rickert and the Southwesterners\nemphasized the importance of reading Kant as a whole and considered the\ncenterpiece of his philosophical program to be the system of the\nfaculties outlined in the introduction to the Critique of\nJudgment (Rickert 1924b, 167). For Rickert, in particular, already\nin Kant\u2019s first Critique \u201cthe focal point\n[\u2026] is not in the transcendental aesthetic and analytic but\nrather in the dialectic, and this means that the main problem\nof this work is not a theory of the experiential sciences\n(Erfahrungswissenschaften). Rather, it revolves around the\nold, ever-recurring problems of metaphysics. The work on these\nproblems becomes the foundation for an encompassing theory of worldview\nculminating in the treatment of issues in the philosophy of religion.\nThe theory of mathematics and physics is merely preparatory\nfor the treatment of these issues\u201d (Rickert 1924b, 153).\nRickert\u2019s Kant is primarily a philosopher of human culture at\nlarge, interested in questions about the meaning and value of our life\nin the world, whereas Cohen\u2019s Kant is primarily (albeit not\nexclusively) a philosopher of the natural sciences. Incidentally, the\nlargely ignored influence of Rickert\u2019s Kant-interpretation is\nstill vivid in Heidegger\u2019s acclaimed book Kant and the\nProblem of Metaphysics (Heidegger 1997).\n\n\nFrom these diverging interpretations of Kant flows another\nfundamental theoretical difference between the two schools. This\ndifference has been effectively phrased by Rickert\u2019s student,\nEmil Lask in terms of \u201cpan-logism\u201d, attributed to the\nMarburg Neo-Kantians, versus the \u201cpan-archy of\nlogos\u201d, attributed to the Southwestern Neo-Kantians\n(Lask 1923, 133; Crowell 2010). If we take the distinction between\nintuition (Anschauung) and concept (Begriff) to be\nthe fundamental paradigm of Kantian transcendentalism, then in\nLask\u2019s eyes the Marburg Neo-Kantians are committed to a kind of\n\u2018pan-logism\u2019 to the extent that they tend to minimize the\nrole of intuition. As is particularly evident, for instance, in Natorp\n(1911, 26\u201367), for the Marburg Neo-Kantians whatever we might be\ntempted to consider a pure given or a raw datum of experience can be\nanalyzed into an underlying thought-process, whereby the given is\nactually constructed according to a conceptually articulable (i.e.,\nlogical) pattern. Every alleged pure given (Gegebenes) is\nactually a task (Aufgegebenes) for conceptual thinking and can\nbe resolved into an underlying thought process governed by logical a\npriori principles.\n\n\nBy contrast, Rickert and the Southwestern Neo-Kantians emphasize\nthe ultimate irreducibility of what is given in intuition to conceptual\nforms. While everything can be grasped by concepts, and therefore no\ndomain of reality and cultural life eludes in principle conceptual\nmastery (pan-archy), nothing can be grasped\nexhaustively by concepts, and therefore our rationality has to\nconstantly take into account an irrational residue intrinsic\nto every conceptual construction. To conceptualize, for Rickert, is to\nrecast the materials delivered immediately by the senses into\na conceptual form. In so doing, we necessarily have to be\nselective, that is, we have to leave out of consideration an\noverwhelming amount of elements and take up in our conceptuality only\nthose elements that match the criteria originally established for the\npurpose of solving our theoretical task. To give a simple example, in\norder to conceptualize, say, linear motion we have to isolate from the\noverwhelming amount of data stemming from the senses only those\nfeatures that pertain to the movement of bodies (spatial location,\nspeed, reciprocal position, etc.) and leave out of consideration\neverything else. This general characterization can serve as a prelude\nto Rickert\u2019s theory of knowledge, which is the theme of the next\nsection.\n",
