    "main_text": "Logic and Philosophy of logic || Opaque contexts\n3.3 Opaque contexts\n\nWhile provers (s\u0101dhana), i.e., logical reasons and\nexamples, can of course be expressed in words, as in a\n\u201cpublic\u201d inference-for-others, they are not themselves\nwords. Although Dharmak\u012brti et al. speak in terms of one\nstate of affairs, or one entity (artha), proving another, in\nfact the picture has all the complex features of the scheme-content\ngap and its bridges: logical reasoning is a mental process that\ndirectly treats of fictional proxies, i.e., concepts, which are in\nturn connected in apoha-fashion to real particular entities.\nNot surprisingly, the idea that provers are apoha-properties\nrather than words has its philosophical complexities. When do we have\nthe same property and when do they differ? When a pervasion is\nbidirectional, or \"equal\" (samavy\u0101pti), as in the case\nof being impermanent (anityatva) and being produced\n(k\u1e5btakatva), it\u2019s quite easy to see that the\nimpermanent particulars will be identical with the produced\nparticulars. Given that the bidirectional pervasion analyzes as\n\u201cfor all x, x is produced if and only if\nx is impermanent\u201d, the extension of the two concepts\n(i.e., the set of impermanent particulars and the set of produced\nparticulars) is the same for Buddhists. Nonetheless, substitutivity of\none term for the other would seem to lead to an invalid inference\nwhere the premises are true but the conclusion is not. To bring out\nthe problem, take the following tempting, but invalid, inference:\n\n\n\n\nBeing a product is a good reason for proving that sound is\nimpermanent. \n\nBeing a\nproduct is coextensive with being impermanent (i.e., for all\nx: x is a product if and only if x is\nimpermanent). \n\nTherefore, being impermanent is a good reason for proving that\nsound is impermanent.  \n\n\n\nWe go from two true premises to a false conclusion, for it is clear\nthat for a Buddhist (as for most people) arguing that something is so\nsimply because it is so is not giving a good reason. And yet\nit might also be thought that the move from premises to conclusion is\nan acceptable application of the principle of substitutivity of\nidenticals for identicals salva veritate. What went\nwrong?\n\nDharmak\u012brti, in Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika I verse\n40 et sq. and Svav\u1e5btti, diagnosed the problem as one of\nbidirectional pervasions (i.e., coextensive concepts) seeming to force\nus to accept pratij\u00f1\u0101rthaikade\u015bahetu\n\u201creasons that are one part of the thesis\u201d (e.g., when one\nsays \u201csound is impermanent because it is impermanent,\u201d\nthen the reason \u201cbeing impermanent\u201d is also a part of the\nthesis that is being proved). He saw this undesirable consequence as\none of the main challenges to logical thought, i.e.,\n\u201cinference,\u201d being a source of knowledge\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a), for unless one can somehow rule out the\nproblematic substitutions in what I have called the \u201ctempting\ninference,\u201d we would be saddled with having to accept as good a\nhuge number of singularly uninformative reasons.\n\nThe problem is recognizably the familiar one of substitutivity in\nreferentially opaque contexts, such as propositional attitudes and\nmodal\n contexts.[52]\n Talk of good reasons being ones where the debater has a desire to\nknow P but not an equivalent Q is indeed an opaque\ncontext. To analyse what goes wrong in the tempting inference,\nDharmak\u012brti, in effect, made a recognizable move by\ndistinguishing between types of identities: \u201cbeing\nimpermanent\u201d and \u201cbeing produced\u201d are extensionally\nidentical, but somehow not intensionally so\u2014what he terms being\nthe same concept, i.e., exclusion (apoha;\nvy\u0101v\u1e5btti). And in the opaque context substitution\nshould only be made between conceptually identical terms.\n\nIn fact, though, it could be said that the usual idea of an\nintensional identity (one that is understood to hold between\nproperties F and G when the biconditional for\nall x: x is F if and only if x is G is true in all possible\nworlds) will not get us very far out of the woods, as being\nimpermanent and being produced are arguably identical in that\nway, and it would thus seem that if that is what conceptual\nidentity is about for a Buddhist Epistemologist it should be\npossible to make the substitution in the opaque contexts under\ndiscussion. Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s idea of concepts F and\nG being identical thus demands a much stronger criterion than\nthe necessary truth of the biconditional for all x: x is F iff x\nis G. In his Svav\u1e5btti ad verse 40 and in\nconsiderable detail in the Tibetan Geluk (dge lugs)\n\u201cCollected Topics\u201d (bsdus grwa) literature and\ncommentaries on Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika, we find the\nmakings of an idea of \u201cconceptual identity/difference\u201d\n(Tibetan ldog pa gcig/tha dad) such that to each meaningful\nsubject or predicate term in a language there is a different\nconcept\u2014synonyms, for example, will express different concepts.\nInterestingly enough, although this individuation of\nexclusions/concepts might seem to lead to an undesirable proliferation\nof strange ultra-intensional entities, at least certain\nEpistemologists\u2014e.g., \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita,\nKamala\u015b\u012bla and very clearly the twelfth-thirteenth century\nTibetan Sa skya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita (in the first chapter of his\nTshad ma rigs gter)\u2014emphasized that concepts were just\nfictions, fa\u00e7ons de parler for different states of\nmind, and even that concepts were not to be reified as any\nkind of object (vi\u1e63aya; Tibetan yul) at all.\nThe states of mind could be individuated unproblematically, and so\nderivatively we could somehow perhaps individuate the concepts too\nwithout committing ourselves to a plethora of occult objects, one for\neach word. It remains to be seen, however, whether shifting the burden\nto states of mind gets us out of the woods or still leaves us with\n\u201csubsistent\u201d entities that should make ontologically\nscrupulous nominalists cringe in horror.\n",
