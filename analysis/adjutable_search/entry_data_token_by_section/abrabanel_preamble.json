    "main_text": "\n\n\nJudah Abrabanel (ca. 1465\u2013after 1521), also known as Leone Ebreo, is\nan important transitional figure in the history of Jewish\nphilosophy. Common to any transitional figure, however, is the problem\nof contextualization. In the case of Judah Abrabanel, do we regard him\nas the last of the medieval Jewish philosophers or the first of the\nearly modern ones?  His work, for example, is certainly in\nconversation with a number of themes found in Renaissance Platonism\nand Humanism. Yet at the same time he freely draws upon the cosmology\nand metaphysics of his Jewish and Islamic predecessors.\n\n\nAbrabanel\u2019s magnum opus, the Dialoghi d\u2019amore\n(\u201cDialogues of Love\u201d) belongs to the genre of the\ntrattato d\u2019amore (\u201ctreatise on love\u201d) that was\nintimately connected to both the Renaissance and the development of\nthe Italian vernacular. Although Abrabanel\u2019s dialogue provides one of\nthe genre\u2019s most important philosophical discussions in this, it\nnonetheless is confined to its literary and stylized form. The work\nitself consists of three dialogues, with the third one providing the\nlongest and most sustained philosophical discussion. Some contend that\nAbrabanel originally composed an introduction to the work and a fourth\ndialogue, neither of which\n survives.[1] \n In essence, the Dialoghi offers the transcript of a\nconversation between two individuals, Philo and Sophia, two courtiers,\nwho discourse on the nature of love as both a sensual and cosmic\nprinciple.  Philo, the male character, is portrayed as an\naccomplished philosopher, and Sophia, the female character, as a\nstudent of philosophy.  Despite this, Sophia is not just a\nconvenient textual strategy, but becomes a character in her own right,\nsomeone who significantly contributes to the philosophical unfolding\nof the work. Moreover, many of the dialogic exchanges that take place\nbetween Philo and Sophia are very playful, with Philo, on one level,\neither answering Sophia\u2019s questions about love or responding to\nher criticisms; yet, on another level, he physically desires Sophia\nand wishes to consummate this desire. Philo\u2019s desire for Sophia,\nthus, reflects the same desire of God (the superior) for the world\n(the inferior). As a Renaissance artist, then, Abrabanel cleverly and\nartfully weaves the philosophical principles of love, beauty, and\ndesire into the very literary structure of his Dialoghi.\n",
