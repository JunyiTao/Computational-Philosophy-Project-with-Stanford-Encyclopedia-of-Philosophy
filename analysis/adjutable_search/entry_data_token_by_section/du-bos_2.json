Du Bos\u2019s impact on the development of aesthetics\n\nNo single person deserves to be credited as the inventor of modern\naesthetics. Several figures in the early eighteenth century\nindependently made contributions to criticism and philosophy that\nwould become modern aesthetics. In England, Shaftesbury\u2019s\nCharacteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, and Times (1711)\nand Joseph Addison\u2019s Pleasures of the Imagination\n(1712) laid some of the groundwork for aesthetics. On the Continent,\nJean-Pierre de Crousaz\u2019s Trait\u00e9 de beau (1715)\nand Christian Wolff\u2019s Rational Thoughts on God, the World,\nand the Soul of Man (1720) were pioneering contributions to\naesthetics. All of these works appeared in the second decade of the\neighteenth century, as did Du Bos\u2019s Critical\nReflections. Du Bos deserves to be recognized as among the\noriginators of modern aesthetics and philosophy of art. His importance\nwas widely recognized in the eighteenth century. Johann Georg Sulzer,\nin his General Theory of the Fine Arts (1771\u201374)\ndescribed Du Bos as \u201cthe first of modern critics to construct a\ntheory of art upon general principles\u201d (Baker and Christensen\n1995, 25).\n\nThe influence of Du Bos on aesthetics in France began with his impact\non Voltaire (Williams 1966). He described Du Bos as \u201ca very\nwise, very learned, and very esteemed man\u201d and, according to\nVoltaire, \u201cAll artists read with profit his Reflections\non poetry, painting, and music\u201d (Voltaire 1877\u201385, vol. 3,\n10; vol. 14, 66). Du Bos\u2019s influence is found at a number of\npoints in Voltaire\u2019s writings. He adopts Du Bos\u2019s\nsubjectivism, writing that, \u201cIn order to judge poets, it is\nnecessary to know how to feel\u201d (Voltaire 1877\u201385, vol. 8,\n319). Voltaire agreed with Du Bos that there have been four ages where\nthe arts particularly flourished and he agreed with Du Bos\u2019s\nassessment of which ages they have been. Voltaire also adopted one of\nDu Bos\u2019s controversial views: the belief that national character\nis affected by matters such as climate.\n\nDu Bos had a significant impact on the Encyclopaedia of\nDiderot and d\u2019Alembert. Louis, chevalier de Jaucourt was the\nauthor of many of this work\u2019s articles on the fine arts and he\ncites Du Bos in the articles on Painting, Modern Painting,\nInscription, Landscape Painting, and Landscape Painter. In fact, a\nlarge chunk of the article on Landscape Painting is lifted wholesale\nout of Critical Reflections, vol. 1, chapter\n6 (d\u2019Alembert et al. 2003).\n\nThe influence of Du Bos on Jean Jacques Rousseau has long since been\nestablished (Jones 1974). This influence is particularly apparent in\nthe Lettre \u00e0 mr d\u2019Alembert sur les spectacles\n(1758). Rousseau agrees with Du Bos that theatre does not aim to\narouse in audience members the sentiment that the characters\nrepresented feel. Rousseau agrees that, on the contrary, theatre\narouses quite opposed sentiments. For example, if a character in a\ntragedy is represented as feeling fear and despair, audience members\nwill have pity aroused in them.\n\nDu Bos seems to have been one of the important sources of the\nresemblance theory of musical expression in the eighteenth century.\nBatteux is known to have read the Critical Reflections and\nwas apparently influenced by Du Bos when he wrote that gestures and\nsounds are \u201cnatural means of expression\u201d that are\n\u201cespecially suited to the expression of emotion\u201d. He adds\nthat \u201cmusic is half-formed in the words that express some\nemotion. It takes only a little art to turn the words into music\n\u201d (Batteux 1746/2015, 129; 133). These passages from The\nFine Arts are little more than paraphrases of passages from the\nCritical Reflections.\n\nDu Bos had a significant influence on aesthetics in Britain. His\ninfluence is found, for example, in James Harris\u2019s Three\nTreatises, particularly in the second of these treatises,\n\u2018A Discourse on Music, Painting and Poetry\u2019 (Harris 1744).\nIn fact, this treatise is little more than a brief reprisal of central\nthemes from the Critical Reflections. Harris, like Du Bos,\ndistinguishes between the fine arts according to their means of\nexpression. Painting employs natural signs and poetry artificial ones.\nThey agree that this gives painting an advantage when it comes to the\narousal of emotion, but both believe that the power of poetry can be\nenhanced by music and staging to the point where it has the advantage\nover poetry. They agree that art owes its value to its capacity to\narouse sentiments.\n\nSince Jones (1982) it has been known that Du Bos had an impact on\nHume\u2019s thinking about art. Hume owned the 1732 edition of the\nCritical Reflections (Norton and Norton, 1996, 88). He must\nhave acquired it soon after his move to France to begin writing his\nTreatise.\n\nHume\u2019s discussion of Du Bos in \u2018Of Tragedy\u2019 has\nalready been noted, but Jones (1982) argues that Du Bos\u2019s\ninfluence is also apparent in \u2018Of the Standard of Taste\u2019.\nHume\u2019s views on art were influenced by several of his\ncontemporaries, including Francis Hutcheson, and it can be difficult\nto disentangle their contributions to his thought. (See the article on\nScottish Philosophy in the 18th Century, section 4 for a discussion of\nHutcheson\u2019s influence on Hume.) The difficulty is compounded by\nthe fact that the views of Hutcheson and Du Bos are similar in certain\nrespects. Nevertheless, Jones (1982) finds significance in the fact\nHume, like Du Bos, believed that we have an internal sense of beauty.\nBoth believe that this sense of beauty, not reason, is the means by\nwhich the beauty of work is determined. Moreover, there is an uncanny\nsimilarity between the ways in which they express these views. Du Bos,\nin the Critical Reflections, and Hume, in \u2018Of the\nStandard of Taste,\u2019 say that they are opposed to\n\u201cgeometrical\u201d criticism. Both believe that rules of\ncriticism can be given, but that they can be violated by great works\nof art. Both give Ariosto as an example of a poet who violates the\nrules of criticism.\n\nJones (1982) noted the impact of Du Bos on Hume\u2019s essays, but\ndid not remark on the impact of the Frenchman on Hume\u2019s\nTreatise. Norton and Norton, in their edition of the\nTreatise (Hume 1739\u201340 [2007]) noted some passages\nwhere Du Bos influenced Hume, but many more passages have recently\nbeen identified (Mazza and Mori 2016; Young and Cameron 2018).\nVirtually every passage in the Treatise where the fine arts\nare mentioned shows signs of Du Bos\u2019s influence. Young and\nCameron (2018) have argued that several passages in the\nTreatise so closely resemble passages in the Critical\nReflections that the similarity cannot be coincidental. For\nexample, both Du Bos and Hume agree that poetry and painting arouse\nthe same emotions that we feel in ordinary life, but that the emotions\naroused by the arts are fainter. Hume, like Du Bos, believes that\npassions that are displeasing when experienced in daily life can be\npleasing when aroused by art. A passage in the Treatise\n(2.2.4.4) refers to Du Bos\u2019s view that humans are plagued by\nennui and they seek to escape it by gaming and other activities. On\nthe other hand, Hume explicitly rejects Du Bos\u2019s view on the\ninfluence of climate on national character. Goldhaber (2021) argues\nthat Hume adopted a four humor psycholgy under the influence of Du\nBos. \n\nLombard (1913) judged that Du Bos\u2019s impact was greatest in\nGermany. Du Bos was responsible for a move away from a rationalist\napproach to criticism there as in France. His influence in Germany is\nfound as early as Johann Jakob Breitinger\u2019s Critische\nDichtkunst (1740). Subsequently, Baumgarten, Herder, Lessing,\nMendelssohn, and Winckelmann either adopted some of Du Bos\u2019s\nviews or argued against them. Lessing translated part of the\nCritical Reflections into German and was deeply influenced by\nhim. For a study of the relationship between Du Bos and Lessing see\nLeysaht (1874).\n",
