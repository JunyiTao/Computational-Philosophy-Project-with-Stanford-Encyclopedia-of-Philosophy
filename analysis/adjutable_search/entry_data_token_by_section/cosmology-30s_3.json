    "main_text": "The Lead-up to the Debate || Hubble\u2019s Expanding Universe\n2.2 Hubble\u2019s Expanding Universe\n\nMost cosmologists\u2014with the interesting exception of Hubble\nhimself\u2014came to the immediate conclusion that the red shift\ncould only mean that the universe was expanding. Immediately the\nrelativity theorists were able to interpret the expansion as a\ncontinuous change in the geometry of spacetime, which was thoroughly\naccounted for by the General Theory of Relativity. After over a decade\nof stagnation in face of the meager choice between just two models of\nthe cosmos, Hubble\u2019s observations spurred theorists on to the\nconstruction of a melange of new models, each vying in competition\nwith the other.\n\nIn the end,  it was the Belgian astronomer Georges\nLeMa\u00eetre\u2019s theory of an expanding, three-stage universe\nthat came to be accepted. LeMa\u00eetre\u2019s model was publicly\nproclaimed as appropriate and generally correct by de Sitter at the\nend of a special session of the British Association for the\nAdvancement of Science, 31 Oct 1931. Modern scientific cosmology had\nbeen officially born; because of its birth within the context of\nEinstein\u2019s theory of relativity, the new cosmology became\nquickly and broadly known as Relativistic Cosmology. The\nmodel of this cosmology is most famously that of the blowing up of a\nballoon painted with dots to represent galaxies. Over time, the radius\nof the model\u2019s spherical space (the balloon) increases, thereby\ndecreasing the curvature of the space (the balloon\u2019s skin), and\nincreasing the distance between the dots.\n\nAlthough cosmologists came from Europe and America as well as Britain,\nmost of the work in theoretical cosmology took place in London,\nCambridge and Oxford. Americans Hubble, Tolman and Robertson did their\nwork at CalTech in Pasadena, but were frequently in England; and most\nof the European and British workers cycled through Pasadena at one\ntime or another. De Sitter, from Holland, and LeMa\u00eetre, from\nBelgium, spent important periods in England, as did various of the\nGerman workers. Thus, even though cosmology was done throughout the\nWestern world, its major concentrating point was England; our focus in\nwhat follows will be the same.\n",
