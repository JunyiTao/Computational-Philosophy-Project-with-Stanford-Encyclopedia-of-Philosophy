    "main_text": "Further Philosophical Issues || Distributive Justice\n4.5 Distributive Justice\n\nRegarding distributive justice, federal political orders must manage\ntensions between ensuring member unit autonomy and securing the\nrequisite redistribution within and among the member units. Indeed,\nthe Federalists regarded federal arrangements as an important\nsafeguard against \u201cthe equal division of property\u201d\n(Federalist 10). The political scientists Linz and Stepan may be seen\nas finding support for the Federalists\u2019 hypothesis: Compared to\nunitary states in the OECD, the \u2018coming together\u2019\nfederations tend to have higher child poverty rate in solo mother\nhouseholds and a higher percentage of population over-sixty living in\npoverty. Linz and Stepan explain this inequality as stemming from the\n\u2018demos constraining\u2019 arrangements of these federations,\nseeking to protect individuals and member units from central\nauthorities, combined with a weak party system. By comparison, the\nConstitution of Germany (not a \u2018coming together\u2019\nfederation) explicitly requires equalization of living conditions\namong the member units (Art. 72.2). Presbey argues that ethnic\nfederalism further exacerbates unfair distribution of resources among\nindividuals of different ethnic groups in Africa (Presbey 2003).\nNormative arguments may also support some distributive significance of\nfederal arrangements, for instance owing to trade-offs between member\nunit autonomy and redistributive claims among member units\n(F\u00f8llesdal 2001), or the relevance of a shared\n\u2018identity\u2018 (Gr\u00e9goire and Jewkes 2015, de Schutter\n2011). A central normative issue is to what extent a shared culture\nand bonds among citizens within a historically sovereign state reduce\nthe claims on redistribution among the member units.\n",
