    "main_text": "Climate Justice in a Nonideal World\n9. Concluding Remarks\n\nIt is time to conclude. This entry has provided an overview of eight\nquestions of justice that arise in the context of climate change. It\nis salutary to end by noting two points\n\nFirst, it is worth noting that the focus has been on climate\njustice and that justice is not the only relevant value. When\nconfronting the challenges of climate change (and the Anthropocene\nmore generally) justice clearly plays a large role, but many would\nargue for the relevance of other kinds of moral consideration,\nincluding a recognition of the intrinsic value of the natural world.\nClimate ethics, one might say, includes more than justice.\n\nSecond, it is also worth noting that taking climate justice seriously\nmay have major implications for existing economic institutions and\nideologies (such as the valorisation of economic growth), as well as\nfor political institutions (Gardiner 2011; Jamieson 2014). Some\ncritics of the status quo believe that capitalism cannot cope with\nclimate change. Some doubt the ability of our contemporary\ninstitutional architecture to address the current challenges facing\nhumanity. Evaluating such claims clearly requires extensive empirical\nanalysis. Only with the help of climate science, history, politics,\neconomics, anthropology, political economy, sociology, science and\ntechnology studies, and law can we begin to address such claims. But\nphilosophical analysis has its part to play and without an\nunderstanding of climate justice we lack a compass to guide us.\n",
