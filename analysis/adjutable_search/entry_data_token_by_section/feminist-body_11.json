    "main_text": "Bodily Practices || Materialisation\n5.3 Materialisation\n\nFor some commentators such a performative account of the formation of\nsexed bodies, fails to capture how the materiality of the body enters\ninto our sense of self. In the preface to Bodies that Matter\nButler reports a common response to her work: \n\n\nWhat about the materiality of the body, Judy? \u2026 an effort\n\u2026 to recall me to a bodily life that could not be theorized\naway \u2026 for surely bodies live and eat; eat and sleep; feel pain\nand pleasure; endure illness and violence; and these facts \u2026\ncannot be dismissed as mere construction. (1993: ix) \n\n\nButler answers such questions by giving an account of the materiality\nof the body in terms of a process of materialisation. Here\nshe is \u201ccalling into question the model of construction whereby\nthe social unilaterally acts on the natural and invests it \u2026\nwith \u2026 meaning\u201d (1993: 4). Instead she offers us a\npicture in which what we count as the material, as nature, as the\ngiven, is not something to which we have unmediated access. It is\nitself a product of particular modes of conceptualizing, modes which\ndo not escape the workings of power. \u201cSex posited as prior to\nconstruction will, by virtue of being posited, become the effect of\nthat very positing\u201d (1993: 5). She concurs with the position of\nSpivak: \n\n\nIf one thinks of the body as such, there is no possible outline of the\nbody as such. There are thinkings of the systematicity of the body,\nthere are value codings of the body. The body, as such, cannot be\nthought, and I certainly cannot approach it. (Spivak 1989)\n\n\nFor Butler, we have to think of matter in terms of \u201ca process of\nmaterialisation that stabilises over time to produce the effect of\nboundary, fixity \u2026 we call matter\u201d (1993: 9). We cannot,\nthen, ask questions about what limits are set by something outside of\nwhat we conceptualize. We can, however, explore the possibilities of\nconceptualizing otherwise. This does not mean that there is nothing\noutside of discourse. Butler makes clear that the body\nexceeds any attempt to capture it in discourse. It is just\nsuch excessiveness which allows the possibility of alternative\nformations of it, for the body outruns any of the ways we might have\nof thinking about it. But we cannot approach the extra-discursive\nexcept by exploring discursive possibilities.\n",
