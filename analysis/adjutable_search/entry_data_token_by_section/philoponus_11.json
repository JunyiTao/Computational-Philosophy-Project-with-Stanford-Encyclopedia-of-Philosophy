    "main_text": "Theological Treatises || Tritheism\n4.3 Tritheism\n\n\nBesides monophysitism, Philoponus\u2019 name is associated with the\ndoctrine of tritheism. However, one needs to be aware of an important\ndifference: Whereas monophysitism was a reputable and powerful\ntheological movement in the Eastern church, tritheism was little more\nthan a hostile label given to certain intellectuals who tried to make\nthe mystery of the Trinity intelligible in philosophical\nlanguage. Philoponus was one such intellectual who, again, resorted to\nAristotelian terminology to clarify and settle the trinitarian\ndispute. Already in the Arbiter it was clear that Philoponus\ntended to understand the crucial term\n\u2018hyp\u00f3stasis\u2019 as meaning something like\n\u2018primary substance\u2019 in the sense of Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories, i.e. an individual organic being. The fragments\nof the very late treatise On the Trinity confirm this. Since\nhyp\u00f3stasis is certainly not an accident of divinity,\nPhiloponus argues, it must be the case that the three\nhypost\u00e1seis of the Trinity are three particular divine\nsubstances with distinct properties. Only on this assumption, too, is\nit reasonable to speak of the consubstantiality of the three Persons,\nfor if there were only one divine substance, what sense would it make\nto speak of consubstantiality at all? When Basil and Gregory of Nyssa\nspoke of the Trinity as \u2018one ous\u00eda, three\nhypost\u00e1seis,\u2019 they were not, Philoponus\ncontinues, enunciating four primary substances, but used\n\u2018substance\u2019 (ous\u00eda) in the secondary,\nabstract sense of essence or universal nature. In accordance with\nAristotle, Philoponus claims that universals exist only in the\nmind. Thus, the claim that there is only one God appears to be true of\nthe unity constituted by the concept of divinity. In actual\nfact, there are three separate divinities, Father, Son, and Spirit. In\norder to fend off any reminiscences of pagan polytheism, Philoponus\npoints out that unlike the individually differentiated gods of the\npagans the three divinities of the Trinity are all of the same, single\ndivine nature in the universal sense of \u2018nature\u2019.  It is important to keep in mind that so-called \u2018tritheists\u2019 like Philoponus would not have conceded that they thereby abandoned monotheism. Although\nPhiloponus had his followers, trinitarian philosophy of this kind\ncould hardly be palatable to anyone not committed before all else to\nAristotle\u2019s ontology. The so-called tritheists faced immediate and\nsevere criticism, and Philoponus himself was condemned by the Council\nof Constantinople of 680\u201381. Only recently, his views seem to have received increased attention and appreciation among philosophically-minded historians of the Church (see Erismann (2008) and Zachhuber (2018)).\n\n\n Philoponus is often celebrated for having been one of the very\nfirst thinkers to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy with\nChristianity. To some extent, this is true, but crucially, his\ncontemporaries must have taken a different view. Pagan philosophers\nabhorred the way in which Philoponus used Christianity as a vantage\npoint from which, in their opinion, he recklessly disturbed the\nharmony of the Greek philosophers, and Christian theologians could not\nbut castigate his attempt to comprehend in Aristotelian terms what was\nfor them, essentially, a profound spiritual mystery demanding belief just because it was philosophically unacceptable.\n",
