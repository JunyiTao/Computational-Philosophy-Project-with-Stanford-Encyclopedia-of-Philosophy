Philosophy of Education\n\nJefferson\u2019s views on education fit hand in glove with his\npolitical\n philosophy.[29]\n To facilitate a government of and for the people, there must be\neducational reform to allow for the general education of the citizenry\nfor fullest political participation, to enable citizens to carry on\ndaily affairs without governmental intervention, and to funnel the\nmost talented and virtuous to a first-tier institution like the\nUniversity of Virginia.\n\nThe sources of Jefferson\u2019s views on education were many. From\nthe French, Jefferson learned that education ought to be equalitarian,\nsecular, and philosophically grounded (Arrowood 1930 [1970]:\n49\u201350). He likely studied the works of Condorcet, La Chalotais,\nDiderot, Charon, and Turgot, and was influenced by men such as\nLafayette, Correa de Serra, Cuvier, Buffon, Humboldt, and Say.\nMoreover, Jefferson corresponded with or read the works of Britons and\nAmericans such as John Adams, Priestley, Locke, Thomas Cooper, Pictet,\nStewart, Tichnor, Richard Price, William Small, Wythe, Fauquier,\nPeyton Randolph, and Patrick Henry (Holowchak 2014a, 69). That\neducation ought to be scientific and useful was emphasized by William\nSmall at William and Mary College as well as his uptake of the\nempirical philosophers of his day and their disdain of metempirical\nsquabbling.\n",
