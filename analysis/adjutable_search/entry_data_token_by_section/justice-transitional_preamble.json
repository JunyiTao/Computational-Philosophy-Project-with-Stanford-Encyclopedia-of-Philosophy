    "main_text": "\n Once violent conflict between two groups has subsided, what is the\nbest way to transition to a civil society? Do former enemies need to\n\u201ccome to terms with their past\u201d if they are to live\npeacefully? If such a reckoning is required, what are the strategies\nof transition available to the parties?\n\n\nThe field of transitional justice, which investigates such questions,\ninvolves the philosophical, legal, and political investigation of the\naftermath of war. This entry will provide an introduction to the\ncentral problems animating this relatively new field. It will do so by\nexamining the history and difficulties associated with the operation\nof three important transitional policies: war crime tribunals, truth\ncommissions, and lustration\n policies.[1]\n We will consider, among others questions,\ntensions between the desire for peace and stability after war and the\nimportance of putting human rights violators on trial, the need, as\npart of a political transition, to create a reliable historical record\nof past abuses, the promise and limitations of international criminal\nlaw, and the coherence of forgiveness in politics.\n\n\nPart 1 provides a theoretical introduction to the nature of\ntransitional justice by highlighting the tensions between peace and\njustice typical of transitional settings. Part 2 examines the\ndifficulties associated with war crime tribunals. Part 3 concentrates\non the dilemmas involved in the operation of truth commissions. Part 4\nfocuses on administrative purges or lustration policies. The final\nsection considers the possibility of forgetting as a response to\n mass\natrocity.[2]\n\n",
