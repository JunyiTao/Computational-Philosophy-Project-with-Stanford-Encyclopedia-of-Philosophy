Paradoxes Resolved\nThe histories approach resolves, or one might say\n\u201ctames\u201d, all the usual quantum paradoxes in the sense of\nproviding a clear explanation of why certain results which seem\npeculiar from the perspective of classical physics are perfectly\nconsistent with quantum theory, and can thus serve as useful\nillustrations of its basic principles. As the explanations have for\nthe most part already been published, what is found below is mostly\njust a few comments along with references.\n",
