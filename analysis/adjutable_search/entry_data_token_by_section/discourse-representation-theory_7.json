    "main_text": "Beyond the basics\n5. Beyond the basics\nHaving focussed thus far on the interpretation of anaphoric\npronouns, the purpose of this section is to illustrate how the ideas\nlying at the heart of DRT have been applied to other phenomena. We\nwill restrict ourselves to three topics: tense, presupposition, and\npropositional attitudes. In the first two cases, we will encounter\ninterpretative dependencies reminiscent of the dependency relation\nbetween an anaphor and its antecedent, and we will describe, if only\nin outline, how basic DRT has been extended so as to capture the\nsimilarities. DRT\u2019s representationalism comes into its own in its\ntreatment of attitudes and attitude ascriptions, which is the third\ntopic on our list. In section 6 we introduce SDRT, a significant extension of the DRT framework designed to model discourse structure more accurately.\n5.1 Tense\nIn the early 1970s, it was pointed out that there are systematic\nparallels between tenses and pronouns (Partee 1973), and DRT was\npartly born from the conviction that a theory of interpretation should\naccount for these parallels. Partee (1984) herself worked out some of\nthese ideas in the DRT framework. In the following we will briefly\ndiscuss some of Partee\u2019s observations, and outline a DRT\ntreatment.\n\n[1a]\nPedro owns a\ndonkey. He beats it. \n[1b]\nYesterday, Pedro\ntried to kiss Juanita. She slapped him. \n\nIntuitively, the indefinite description \u201ca donkey\u201d in\nthe opening sentence of [1a] serves to introduce an entity that is\nsubsequently picked up by the pronoun \u201cit\u201d in the second\nsentence, and the DRT account of indefinites and pronouns seeks to\nformalize this intuitive picture. [1b] shows that a very similar\nphenomenon occurs in the temporal domain, for in this case it is\nnatural to construe the past tense of the second sentence as being\nanaphorically dependent on the content of the first: presumably,\nJuanita slapped Pedro right after he tried to kiss her. In order to\ncapture this idea, DRT adopts an event-based semantics, treating\nevents as semantic values of a designated class of discourse\nreferents. Sentences are now construed like indefinite descriptions in\nthat they, too, serve to introduce discourse referents. For example,\nthe first sentence in [1b] introduces a discourse referent of the\nevent type that represents Pedro\u2019s attempting to kiss Juanita, and the\ntense morpheme in \u201cslapped\u201d is construed as referring\nback, very much like an anaphoric pronoun, to that event: by default,\nthe time of Juanita\u2019s slapping Pedro will be taken to be immediately\nafter the time of him trying to kiss her.\nOur second example involves what one might call \u201cdonkey\ntense\u201d:\n\n[2a]\nEvery farmer who\nowns a donkey beats it. \n[2b]\nWhenever Pedro\ntried to kiss Juanita, she slapped him.\n\nIn an event-based semantics, it is natural to construe [2b] as\nquantifying over events, just like [2a] quantifies over\nindividuals. In conjunction with the DRT treatment of quantification,\nthis allows us to interpret the tense in \u201cslapped\u201d as\nreferring back to the event introduced in the subordinate clause,\nalong the following lines (where \u2283\u2282 stands for\nthe \u201cright after\u201d\nrelation, e\u2033 is the variable\nintroduced by the tense in \u201cslapped\u201d,\nand e\u2033 indicates\nthat e\u2033 requires an\nantecedent):\n\n[3a]\n[x,\ny: Pedro(x), Juanita(y),\n[e: try-to-kiss(e,x,y)](\u2200e)[e\u2032, e\u2033 : e\u2033 \u2283\u2282 e\u2032, slap(e\u2032,y,x)] ]\n[3b]\n[x,\ny: Pedro(x), Juanita(y),\n[e: try-to-kiss(e,x,y)](\u2200e)[e\u2032: e \u2283\u2282 e\u2032, slap(e\u2032,y,x)] ]\n\nIn [3a] the tense introduces an anaphoric element, which can be\nbound in the restrictor of the quantifier, just as an ordinary donkey\npronoun might be bound. The result, after a minor simplification, is\n[3b], which says that every event e of Pedro trying to kiss Juanita is\nimmediately followed by an event e\u2032 of her slapping him. Note\nthat, although this DRS captures the most natural interpretation of\nthe past tense in \u201cslapped\u201d, it leaves the past tense in\n\u201ctried\u201d unaccounted for. But this is as it should be, for\nif tense is anaphoric, then that tense, too, should be linked to a\nsalient time point, which seems to be right: in the absence of a\ncontext that furnishes such a time, [2b] is simply infelicitous; it is\nlike saying \u201cHe is handsome\u201d when it is not clear whom the\npronoun is intended to refer to.\n5.2 Presupposition\nPresuppositions are chunks of information associated with\nparticular lexical items or syntactic constructions. There are many\nsuch items and constructions, and the following is just a small\nselection: \n\nFactive verbs\n\n[4a]\nJuan knows that\nPedro beats his donkey.\n[4b]\nPedro beats his\ndonkey.\n\nIt-clefts\n\n[5a]\nIt\u2019s in the stable\nthat Pedro beats his donkey.\n[5b]\nPedro beats his\ndonkey.\n\nDefinites\n\n[6a]\nPedro beats his\ndonkey.\n[6b]\nPedro has a\ndonkey.\n\n\nSomeone who utters any of the [a] sentences commits himself to the\ntruth of the respective [b] sentence. Of course, this does nothing to\ndistinguish presuppositions from ordinary entailments, but the\ndifference becomes apparent when we embed presuppositional expressions\nor constructions in non-entailing environments, as in:\n\n[7a]\nIt isn\u2019t in the\nstable that Pedro beats his donkey.\n[7b]\nMaybe it\u2019s in the\nstable that Pedro beats his donkey.\n\nHere [5a] is embedded in the scope of a negation and a modal\noperator, respectively, and it appears that these sentences commit a\nspeaker to the truth of [5b] just as much as [5a] does. This behavior\nsets presuppositions apart from ordinary entailments.\nGenerally speaking, presuppositions tend to escape\nfrom any embedded position in the sense that, if a\nsentence S contains a presupposition-inducing\nexpression P, an utterance of S will usually imply\nthat P holds. This is only generally speaking, because this\nrule, though correct in the majority of cases, does not hold without\nexceptions:\n\n[8a]\nIt may be that\nPedro is a mean farmer, and that he beats his donkey.\n[8b]\nIt may be that\nPedro has a donkey, and that he beats his donkey.\n[9a]\nIf Pedro is a mean\nfarmer, he beats his donkey.\n[9b]\nIf Pedro has a\ndonkey, he beats his donkey.\n\nWhile the [a] sentences would normally commit a speaker to the\nclaim that Pedro has a donkey, the same does not hold for the [b]\nsentences.  It appears, therefore, that presuppositions are typically\nthough not invariably inherited by the sentences in which they\noccur. This is the so-called \u201cprojection problem\u201d for\npresuppositions.\nConsidering that anaphora and presupposition were widely discussed\nfrom the late 1960s onwards, it took a remarkably long time before it\nwas discovered that, in some respects at least, the two phenomena are\nvery similar (van der Sandt 1992, Kripke 2009). To see how, consider\nthe following pairs:\n\n[10a]\nPedro owns a\ndonkey. Juan knows {it / that he owns a donkey}.\n[10b]\nIf Pedro owns a\ndonkey, Juan knows {it / that he owns a donkey}.\n[10c]\nEvery farmer who\nowns a donkey knows {it / that he owns a donkey}.\n\nIt is true that the variants with the\n\u201cthat\u201d-complements are slightly odd, but actually the fact\nthat they are proves the point we want to make; for it is clear that,\nin these examples, the pronoun \u201cit\u201d and the clause\n\u201cthat he owns a donkey\u201d perform the same duty, and if the\nlatter sounds somewhat off it is presumably because the former does\nthe job just as well.\nWhile the factive verb \u201cknow\u201d triggers the\npresupposition that its clausal complement is true, this\npresupposition is neutralized in [10b] and [10c]. If presuppositions\nbehave similarly to anaphoric pronouns, it is clear why that should be\nso: in both cases, the presupposition is bound\nsentence-internally, just like the neuter pronoun is bound.\nPresupposed information is information that is presented as given,\nand according to the so-called \u201cbinding theory\u201d of\npresupposition this means that presuppositions want to have discourse\nreferents to bind to (van der Sandt 1992, Geurts 1999).  However,\nwhereas anaphoric pronouns are rarely interpretable in the absence of\na suitable antecedent, the same does not hold for all\npresupposition-inducing expressions. For instance, a speaker may\nfelicitously assert that he met \u201cPedro\u2019s sister\u201d even if\nhe knows full well that his audience wasn\u2019t aware that Pedro has a\nsister. In such cases, Karttunen (1974) and Stalnaker (1974)\nsuggested, presuppositions are\ngenerally accommodated, which is to say that the\nhearer accepts the information as given, and revises his\nrepresentation of the context accordingly. Accommodation, thus\nunderstood, is a form of exploitation in Grice\u2019s sense: the purpose of\npresuppositional expressions is to signal that this or that\ninformation is given, and if some information is new but not\nparticularly interesting or controversial (like the fact that somebody\nhas a sister) the speaker may choose to \u201cget it out of the\nway\u201d by presuppositional means.\nThe binding theory incorporates the notion of accommodation as\nfollows. Presuppositions, according to the theory, introduce\ninformation that prefers to be linked to discourse referents that are\nalready available in the DRS, and in this respect they are like\npronouns. However, if a suitable discourse referent is not available,\na new one will be accommodated, and the presupposition is linked to\nthat.  Generally speaking, accommodation is not an option in the\ninterpretation of pronouns, and a possible reason for this is that a\npronoun\u2019s descriptive content is relatively poor. Being told that\n\u201cshe\u201d is wonderful is not particularly helpful if it isn\u2019t\nclear who the pronoun is meant to refer to. By contrast, if the\nspeaker refers to \u201cPedro\u2019s sister\u201d there is more to go on,\nand accommodation becomes feasible. Hence, the binding theory views\npronouns as a special class of presuppositional expressions. While all\npresupposition triggers prefer to be bound, pronouns almost always\nmust be bound. According to the binding theory, this is because\npronouns are descriptively attenuated, and therefore cannot be\nconstrued by way of accommodation.\n5.3 Attitudes and attitude ascriptions\nPropositional attitudes (mental states like belief, desire, or\nimagination) and attitude ascriptions (sentences like \u201cJohn\nthinks/hopes that Mary likes him\u201d) have been a rich source of\nphilosophical puzzles. DRT\u2019s representationalism offers fresh\nsolutions to some of them.\nA central issue in the treatment of attitudes is that of logical\nomniscience: humans are cognitively limited agents, and are not aware\nof all the consequences of their beliefs and desires. On this basis,\nKamp (1990) argues that the objects of thought should not be seen as\npurely model-theoretic entities, for example a set of belief worlds,\nas is common in logics of belief from Hintikka (1962) onwards. Rather,\nthe logic of belief and other attitudes must involve structured mental\nrepresentations. The problem of logical omniscience is then resolved\nin terms of the failure of human agents to perform logically complete\ncomputations over these representations. Modeling the objects of\nattitudes in this way, as representational entities, allows us to make\nthe fine distinctions necessary to distinguish between believing that\nit is raining and believing that if it is not raining then 37 is not\nprime. However, traditional versions of such a sententialist or\nLanguage-of-Thought approach to omniscience typically run into the\nproblem of intentionality: to be useful to us, our attitudes must\nsomehow be about the external world we live in, so we still have to\nexplain how these syntactic representations connect with reality. In a\nHintikka-style possible worlds semantics the link between world and\nattitude is hardwired into the semantics: believing that John is happy\nmeans that the agent takes the actual world to be an element of the\nset of worlds where John is happy. The DRT approach combines these two\nstrategies: use the classic, model-theoretic semantics of the DRS\nlanguage to cash out intentionality in terms of possible worlds, but\nhold on to the representational level to model resource-bounded\ncomputations in practical reasoning.\n A special type of intentionality is that of singular or de\nre attitudes: beliefs and desires that directly involve objects\nthe attitude holder is acquainted with. To capture such attitudes,\nKamp (1990) introduces anchors. An internal anchor is a descriptive\nmode of presentation, in the form of a DRS with a distinguished\ndiscourse referent, while an external anchor maps that discourse\n  referent to an actual individual. A full-fledged entity representation comprises an internal and an external anchor, and is a construct closely related to the Mental Files of Recanati (2012) and other neo-Fregean approaches to reference.\nA complete mental state\nrepresentation then consists of (i) a set of internal anchors and\nattitude descriptions, each consisting of a DRS paired with a mode\nindicator (e.g., ANCH, \nBEL, \nDES) and possibly sharing discourse\nreferents, and (ii) an external anchor mapping the internally anchored\ndiscourse referents to objects of acquaintance. By way of\nillustration, the mental state representation below describes\nmy de re belief that this cup c I\u2019m holding now\ncontains coffee, along with the desire that it is still warm:\n\n[1a]\ninternal mental state: {\u00a0\u00a0<ANCH x, [x: cup(x), hold(i,x)]>, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<BEL, [y: contains(x,y), coffee(y)]>, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<DES, [: warm(y)]> }\n[1b]\n\n external anchor: {<x,c>}\nCompartmentalized mental state representations like this have been\nturned into semantic theories of attitude ascriptions and used to\nsolve a variety of familiar puzzles, such as those involving Kripke\u2019s\n(1979) Pierre who believes Londres is pretty but London is not (Asher\n1986, Kamp 2015), Geach\u2019s (1967) Hob who believes a witch killed his\ncow while Nob believes she, the same witch, blighted his mare (Asher\n1987), specific indefinites (Kamp and Bende-Farkas 2019), presupposition projection out of\n(non-doxastic) attitude ascriptions (Maier 2015), and referring to fictional entities (Maier 2017).\nNot all DRT treatments of attitude reports rely on a\nrepresentational theory of the underlying mental states\nthemselves. For example, Geurts (1999) and Maier (2010) develop\nanalyses of attitude ascriptions in versions of DRT that use only a\nstandard Hintikka-style possible worlds semantics for attitudes. In\nthe same vein, Maier (2009) and Hunter (2013) explore extensions of\nDRT to deal with directly referential expressions like indexicals and\nproper names without resorting to anchors or mental state\nrepresentations.\n6. Discourse relations in SDRT\nWe\u2019ve seen in sections 3 and 4 above how anaphora resolution\nis constrained by accessibility. But there are many other factors that play a role in\nthe resolution process, from local, grammatical factors like subject\nantecedents being generally more prominent than object antecedents in pronoun\nresolution, to more global, discourse structural factors. Focusing on the latter,\nHobbs (1979) argues that the interpreter\u2019s desire to create a maximally coherent\ninterpretation will often play a decisive role in choosing between multiple\naccessible antecedents for a pronoun, as he illustrates with the following contrast:\n\n[1a]\n\n John can open Bill\u2019s safe. He knows the combination. \n[1b]\n John can open Bill\u2019s safe. He\u2019ll have to change the combination soon.\n  \n\nIn [1a] the pronoun binds to John, because that delivers the most coherent\ninterpretation of the two-sentence discourse as a whole. In [1b], by contrast, the\npronoun is bound to Bill. This difference corresponds to a difference in the kind of\ncoherence relations exemplified by the two discourses: [1a] exemplifies a coherence\nrelation known as Elaboration, while [1b] is an instance of Result. That discourse\nrelations play an important role in discourse interpretation is shown by examples like\n  [2] (again from Hobbs 1979).\n\n[2]\n\n John took a train from Paris to Istanbul. He likes spinach.  \n  \n\n Reading [2] you might wonder if Turkish spinach is really that much better than\nwhat you can get in France, which shows to what lengths we go to accommodate a\nsuitable coherence relation, in this case Explanation, before we give up our quest for\n  a coherent interpretation.\n   Asher and Lascarides (2003) take the idea that pronoun resolution and the\ninference of coherence relations between discourse units are closely related processes\nas the starting point for their Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT),\ncombining DRT with insights from discourse coherence theories like Hobbs\u2019s. SDRT\nassumes a set of discourse relations (Narration, Result, Contrast, Explanation,\nElaboration, Correction, to name a few) that we may infer to connect the\npropositions expressed by the individual sentences (or clauses), in order to create a\nmaximally coherent interpretation of the discourse as a whole. Different discourse\nrelations may impose different constraints on anaphora resolution over and\nabove DRT\u2019s accessibility. Take the example in [3] (Asher and Lascarides\n  2003).\n\n[3a]\n\nJohn had a great evening last night. \n  \n[3b]\n\nHe had a great meal. \n  \n[3c]\n\nHe ate salmon.\n  \n[3d]\n\n[3d] He devoured lots of cheese.\n  \n[3e]\n\nHe won a dancing competition.\n  \n[3f]\n\n??It was a beautiful pink.\n  \n\nIn standard DRT the salmon introduced in [3c] would provide a suitable and\naccessible antecedent for the pronoun in [3f], but in fact this resolution appears to be\nunavailable. SDRT explains this observation in terms of a discourse structural\nconstraint known as the Right Frontier Constraint. This constraint is best illustrated\nby drawing a discourse structure graph like the one below. A horizontal arrow in this\ngraph indicates a coordinating discourse relation (where neither relatum dominates\nthe other), in this case Narration. A vertical arrow indicates a subordinating\ndiscourse relation (where a nucleus dominates a satellite), in this case Elaboration.\n\n\n\n[3a]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2193Elaboration\n\n\n\n\n\n[3b]\n\u2192\n[3e]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2193Elaboration\n\u00a0\u00a0Narration\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n[3c]\n\u2192\n[3d]\n\n\n\nNarration\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSDRT\u2019s version of the Right Frontier Constraint says that the pronoun in [3f] can\nonly find an antecedent introduced in the node that was just introduced ([3e]), or one\n  that dominates it ([3a]).\n   More formally, an SDRS consists of such a discourse structure graph, where each\nvertex corresponds to a discourse relation and each node to a DRS. A common SDRS\nnotation extends the familiar box notation of DRT (see section 4) with labels for\n  elementary and complex discourse units:\n\n\u03c01 \u03c06\n\u03c01:[x: John(x), great-time(x)]\n\n\n\u03c06:\n\n\u03c02 \u03c05 \u03c07\n\u03c02:[: great-meal(x)]\n\u03c05:[: won-dance(x)]\nNarration(\u03c02,\u03c05)\n\n\n\u03c07:\n\n\u03c03  \u03c04\n\u03c03:[: ate-salmon(x)]\n\u03c04:[: devoured-cheese(x)]\nNarration(\u03c03,\u03c04)\n\n\nElaboration(\u03c02,\u03c07)\n\n\nElaboration(\u03c01,\u03c06)\n\nAnaphora and presupposition resolution rely on a modified notion of\naccessibility that incorporates the Right Frontier Constraint. The\nmodel-theoretic interpretation of an SDRS is built around a set of\nspecial interpretation rules for the various discourse\nrelations. Narration for instance comes with a semantic interpretation\nrule that states that the both relata hold and moreover the main\nevents they introduce stand in a relation of temporal\nprogression. Some notational\nshortcuts: K\u03c0 is the DRS\nassociated with label \u03c0 (i.e. the K such\nthat \u03c0 : K occurs somewhere in the\nSDRS); e\u03c0 is the unique event\ndiscourse referent that occurs\nin U(K\u03c0) (for readability\nwe left out event referents from the example SDRS above, but for the purpose of modelling narrative temporal progression in SDRT we should treat every verb phrase as introducing an event discourse referent).\n\nf verifies Narration(\u03c01,\u03c02) iff there is an embedding function g such that f[K\u03c01]g\nand g verifies K\u03c01, and there is an embedding h such that g[K\u03c02]h and h verifies K\u03c02 and moreover h(e\u03c01) \u2283\u2282h(e\u03c02)\n\nNote that conditions of the form \u03c0n : K are not interpreted directly as semantic conditions on their own, but instead serve to associate DRS contents with\n proposition labels.\n7. Representationalism and compositionality\nDRT is a representational theory of interpretation. In the DRT\nframework, sentences have meanings, if at all, only in a derivative\nsense: a sentence prompts the hearer to modify his DRS, and it is DRSs\nthat have a truth-conditional interpretation. Thus, a sentence causes\na DRS Ki to be\ntransformed into a\nDRS Ki+1 (usually,\nthough not invariably, the process will consist in adding information\nto Ki), and at a remove\nthere is an associated transition at the semantical level,\nfrom Ki\u2019s\ninterpretation\nto Ki+1\u2019s.  Hence, if\nwe could cut out the representational middleman, we would have a\ntheory that defines sentence meaning in dynamic terms, as a transition\nfrom one semantic object to another. Thus arises the question of\nwhether or not the representational level can be dispensed with. Kamp\n(1981) claimed that representations were essential to\nhis ur-version of DRT, which was a subset of our\nbasic DRT, but in the meantime he was proved wrong by a slew of\ndynamic theories that recast classical DRT in purely semantical terms:\nBarwise (1987), Rooth (1987), Groenendijk and Stokhof (1989, 1991),\nMuskens (1996), and many more. However, Kamp\u2019s claim still holds for\nvarious extensions of classical DRT, like the theories of\npresupposition and attitude ascription discussed in the foregoing.\nThese theories are allegedly \u201cnon-representational\u201d,\nbut what exactly does that mean? Consider, for example, Groenendijk\nand Stokhof\u2019s (1991) Dynamic Predicate Logic (DPL), which provides a\ndynamic semantics for the language of classical predicate logic, in\nwhich \u201cPedro owns a donkey and beats it\u201d may be rendered\nas follows:\n\n[1]\n\n\u2203x[donkey(x) & own(Pedro,x)]\n& beat(Pedro,x)\n\nDPL\u2019s semantics ensures that, unlike in classical logic, the last\noccurrence of x is bound by the existential quantifier. The\nway this works is that DPL analyzes sentence meanings in terms of\nvariable assignments, which are manipulated by the logical constants\nin such as way that [1] is true in a model M iff M\u2019s\ndomain features an individual which, when assigned to the\nvariable x, makes each of the atomic sentences in [1] come\nout true in M. Formally, this is implemented by stipulating\nthat the meaning of a sentence is a relation between variable\nassignments.\nA variable assignment is a mapping from variables to individuals,\nand variables are linguistic expressions, so it can hardly be claimed\nthat assignments are non-representational entities. Therefore, it is a\nbit puzzling that, in contrast to DRT, DPL is widely seen as a\nnon-representational variety of dynamic semantics. True, DRT\u2019s\nrepresentationalism goes quite a bit further than DPL\u2019s, and the two\ntheories are obviously very different in this respect, but both\ntheories import representational elements into semantics, and this\nholds for dynamic theories of semantics generally (though see Dekker\n2012 for exceptions).\nNote, incidentally, that DRT\u2019s representationalism is not\nparticularly troubling from a psychological point of view. For if we\nadopt a cognitivist perspective, and view DRT as a (somewhat abstract)\ntheory of the psychology of interpretation, then its\nrepresentationalism wouldn\u2019t be particularly controversial, since for\nmost psychologists, the controversy is not over whether there exist\nmental representations, but over what they are like.\n One way in which DRT\u2019s representationalism manifests itself as\nbeing more radical than other theories\u2019 is that it is a\nnon-compositional theory as well. These two features are intertwined.\nConsider, for instance, the way pronouns are interpreted in basic DRT,\nby first setting up a discourse referent, which is subsequently linked\nto another discourse referent. This is a non-deterministic process,\nbut even if it were not, it is clear that the anaphoric link is not\npart of the meaning of the pronoun. A standard statement of\ncompositionality would say that the meaning of a compound expression\nmust be a function of the meaning of their components and their mode\nof combination. But if some of the components, like pronouns, do not\nintroduce into the DRS any object that can naturally be described as\nthe meaning of that object, then it is clear that we do not have a\ncompositional system.\nHow bad is it that we lose compositionality? It is generally agreed\nthat some of the standard arguments for compositionality are not\nparticularly compelling. In particular, we don\u2019t need compositionality\nto explain why people can understand an indefinite number of\nsentences, and we don\u2019t need it for explaining how languages can be\nlearned. To explain such facts, it suffices that there is some\nprocedure for establishing the meanings of sentences, but it is not\nstrictly necessary for this procedure to be compositional.\nCompositionality is often viewed as a methodological principle\n(Groenendijk and Stokhof 1989, 1991; Janssen 1997; Dever 1999), since\nany model of interpretation can be made compositional if we are\nsufficiently relaxed about the nature of lexical meanings and/or the\nsyntactic structures over which the compositional theory is\ndefined. In the case of DRT, the standard approaches to making the\nsystem compositional involve dispensing with Kamp\u2019s construction\nalgorithm, and replacing it with a system in which DRSs can be\ncomposed either through suitable merge operations (Zeevat 1989b), or,\nin dynamic semantic systems like those of Groenendijk and Stokhof\n(1989) and Muskens (1996), through use of function application in a\nlambda calculus. But while most such systems capture meanings for\nsentences that are closely related to those of original DRT, they do\nnot capture every aspect of DRT. In particular, whereas anaphora\nresolution is an integral part of DRT, in compositional theories anaphora resolution is\nassumed to be performed by a separate component of the theory.\nRepresentationalism and compositionality are issues that have\nproduced great disagreement amongst semanticists and philosophers of\nlanguage, though less so nowadays than they did in the 1980s. The\nmethodological view of compositionality has reduced what appeared once\nto be a substantive argument to a matter of taste, and as regards DRT\nit has been shown that researchers who care about compositionality are\nfree to adopt a variant of the original system with many of its\nfeatures, but none of its non-compositionality. But\nrepresentationalism may be a more serious issue, for if it is true, as\nwe have suggested, that dynamic theories generally rely on a notion of\nmeaning that contains at least some form of representation, then that\nnotion could do with a bit more philosophical attention than it has\nreceived so far. \n7.
