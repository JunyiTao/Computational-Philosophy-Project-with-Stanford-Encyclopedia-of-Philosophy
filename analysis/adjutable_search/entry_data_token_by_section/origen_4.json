The Work of Christ\n\nNevertheless, since the fall has darkened our minds and subjected our\nbodies to corruption, we cannot effect our own salvation without the\nassistance of God\u2019s word made flesh. For Origen the virgin birth\nis a datable event, an appropriation by the Word of full humanity in\nbody, soul and spirit. The union can be described as an\nanakrasis or mixture (Cels. 3.41), a voluntary\ncleaving of the flesh or soul to the Word, and (in defiance of\nchemical facts) as the sublimation of the humanity by the divinity, as\niron loses its form when held in an incandescent flame\n(Princ. 2.6.4) The humanity, for all that, is not\nannihilated, and Christ can speak at times as man and at others with\nGod without being guilty of dissimulation (CommJohn 19.2.6).\nHis own words \u201cmy soul is sorrowful unto death\u201d reveals\nhis possession of a soul, which mediates between the flesh and the\ndivinity which would otherwise destroy it. While the soul (for Christ\nas for us) is invariably the seat of passion, some of his passions\noriginate in his spirit, which, though human, is divinely irradiated\nby the Word. By virtue of this irradiation, he foresees his own death,\nand his prescience gives rise not to a commotion of the\nspirit but to a commotion in the spirit, which is experienced\nas a passion of the soul (CommJohn\n32.18.221\u2013224). The body which clothes him before the\ncrucifixion is as palpable as ours, and equally vulnerable to physical\naffections. After his resurrection, he does not show himself to\nCaiaphas and Pilate because he is visible only to the eye of faith\n(Cels. 2.60\u201365). This means not, however, that his body\nis no real body, but that it no longer suffers the consequences of the\nfall.\n\nThe blood of Christ, first in his circumcision and then on the Cross,\nis a ransom paid to Satan (Commentary on Romans 2.13.29; cf.\n1 Corinthians 6.23), whose prisoners we become, willingly if\nunwittingly, when we allow his image to oust that of god in our souls\n(Genesis Homilies 1.13). Yet Satan is never master of our\nwills: if he enters the soul of a Judas Iscariot, it is because the\nthought that he plants there has received assent and ripened into a\nsinful disposition (CommJohn 32.281\u2013285; see further\nLayton 2004: 129\u2013131.) We are taught to suppress such thoughts\nand to refrain from sin, by the teaching of Christ, the chief of his\nbounties during his earthly sojourn, which we now receive in even\ngreater measure through the scriptures. As the primordial Word of God,\nhe is present in every word from God that the church has canonised\nunder the direction of the Spirit; the many words of scripture, in\nfact, are one (Philokalia 5.4). When we are instructed to eat\nthe flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man, it is clear that the\nwords cannot be taken literally; while Origen does not deny the\nallusion to the eucharist, he argues that the higher sense\u2014but\nalso the quotidian sense\u2014of the saying is that believers must\ndraw nourishment from the scriptures in which Christ \u201cas it\nwere, takes flesh and speaks with a literal voice\u201d in order to\ndraw us on to the invisible mysteries (Cels. 4.15; On\nPrayer 27.10\u201314). The scriptures, then, are the daily bread\nfor which Christians are taught to pray; to accept eating as a\nmetaphor for reading is to acknowledge that whenever the scriptures\nspeak of tasting, hearing or seeing God, they are not only imparting\nwhat we might call a spiritual sense to these words, but appealing to\nour own spiritual senses (Princ. 1.1.9), the loftier\nfaculties which were freely exercised by Adam and Eve before the fall\n(Cels. 7.39; see further Rahner 1979).\n\nTo distinguish only two senses of scripture is to forget that Christ,\nthe true Word, became incarnate in a threefold human nature. At\nFirst Principles 4.2.4, Origen asserts that the body, the\nsoul and the spirit of the human reader find their respective\nanalogues in the text that is being read. The body is the plain text,\nwhether narrative or didactic, construed according to common\ngrammatical or semantic norms. The spirit, which must generally be\nsought beneath the surface, acquaints us with the work of Christ and\nthe mysteries of faith, and thus corresponds to the typological sense\nin mediaeval and modern exegesis. The soul of scripture is illustrated\nby Paul\u2019s translation of the Mosaic precept, \u201cthou shalt\nnot muzzle the ox which treadeth the corn\u201d, to ministers of the\nchurch (Princ. 4.2.6). For this reason, and because the\nchurch is the bride of Christ in Origen\u2019s exposition of the soul\nof the Song of Songs, the term \u201cecclesiastical\u201d has been\napplied to this intermediate plane of reference. In works which\nsurvive in Latin certain passages are said to be amenable to a\nliteral, a moral and a spiritual exposition, but we cannot say whether\nOrigen employed a Greek equivalent to the term \u201cmoral\u201d. It\nis possible that he offers us a further clue to the content of the\npsychic sense in the prologue to his Commentary on the Song of\nSongs (ed. Baehrens 1925: 75), where he argues that each of the\nthree books ascribed to Solomon in the Hebrew canon corresponds to a\nbranch of Greek philosophy, and also to one stage in the\nbeliever\u2019s progress from the foothills to the summit of\nunderstanding. Ethics is represented in this itinerary by Proverbs,\nphysics by Ecclesiastics, the science of contemplation (theorics,\nepoptics or enoptics) by the Song. The first of these texts is phrased\nand may be understood somatically; the third, in which Solomon forgoes\nhis own name and becomes the bridegroom, lifts the veil between the\nenlightened soul and her Redeemer (see further King 2005:\n222\u2013263). If we pursue this seductive analogy, the second book\nof Solomon, which reveals our place in the cosmos, is a mine of\ncosmological or sapiential teaching which may be said to represent the\nsoul of scripture.\n\nThis pattern would appear to have been suggested not by the usual\ndivision of philosophy into ethics, physics and logic, but by a\npassage in Clement of Alexandria, where three edifying senses are\naccorded to the scriptures, the last of which is the\nepopteia, or discernment of the mysteries (Stromateis\n1.176.1\u20132). Origen may also have been aware that certain\nteachers had sorted Plato\u2019s dialogues into different categories,\neach suited to a different level of aptitude in the pupil (Edwards\n1997). If, as some manuscripts indicate, he gave the name\n\u201ctheoric\u201d (either instead of or in addition to\n\u201cepoptic\u201d) to the most elevated level of understanding, he\nmay have had in mind a Platonic or Pythagorean division of philosophy\ninto ethics, physics and theology, which is attested in a commentary\nby Iamblichus on Nicomachus of Gerasa\u2019s Introduction to\nMathematics. In attributing this taxonomy to the Hebrew king, however,\nhe is making a claim for the chronological primacy of the scriptures.\nNo Platonist before him had undertaken a sustained allegorical reading\nof any text, as Porphyry confessed when he inaccurately charged him\nwith forcing Stoic techniques of exegesis on a barbarous text\n(Eusebius, Church History 6.19). Commenting line by line on a\nsacred text was not, so far as our evidence goes, a typical enterprise\nfor a Stoic. Among the Greeks the commentator who most resembles\nOrigen is Alexander of Aphrodisias; his concern, however, is to smooth\nthe surface of Aristotle, not to dig beneath it (see further\nBendinelli 1997). Origen\u2019s true predecessor is Philo of\nAlexandria, who had teased moral and metaphysical profundities from\nthe Torah, verse by verse, in order to demonstrate that nothing taught\namong the Greeks had been concealed from the Lawgiver of the Jews (see\nfurther Dawson 1992).\n\nPhilo is called a mystic because of passages which thirstily\nanticipate the mind\u2019s bacchanalian ecstasy in the presence of\nthe ineffable. For Origen the term mystikos denotes the most\narcane sense of the scriptures, and the encounter with the Bridegroom,\n\u201cwhich no-one can understand who has not experienced it\u201d,\nis described in his Homilies on the Song of Songs (I.7 [ed.\nBaehrens 1925: 39]). Whether it is a true ecstasy or a sense of\nhermeneutic illumination (Louth 2000: 69), this transient rapture\nforeshadows the culmination of the soul\u2019s journey after death,\nwhen God will at last be all in all. In answer to the jibes of Celsus,\nOrigen asserts that, while the church teaches the resurrection of the\nbody, the \u201cspiritual body\u201d of which Paul speaks will be of\na rarer and hence more durable texture than the gross flesh which now\nensheathes the soul (Cels. 5.18\u20135.23). In a dialogue\nwhich now survives only in excerpts, the soul is said to retain the\neidos, or form, of the body, perhaps a counterpart to the\ntenuous vehicle which the soul carries into the afterlife in the\neschatology of some Platonists (Methodius, On the\nResurrection 22 [ed. Bonwetsch 1899: 93]; see further Schibli\n1992). Most souls, having failed to purge their sins in this life,\nwill be required to pass the flaming sword that bars the entrance to\nthe earthly paradise (see further Crouzel 1972). Once its cleansing\nthere is complete, the soul will pass through the seven planetary\nspheres, acquiring a more comprehensive knowledge of the cosmos and\nour place in it than is vouchsafed to us in this world\n(Princ. 1.11.6). Once again, kindred notions can be found in\nPlatonic and Hermetic literature; the posthumous itinerary mirrors the\ntransition from the ethical to the sapiential teachings of Solomon,\nand we see here in an inchoate form the purgative and illuminative\nways of the western mystical tradition. A body of some kind is\npresupposed by this celestial topography; nevertheless, at the point\nwhere God becomes all in all, we hear nothing of a body, but only that\nsoul will be entirely subsumed in spirit. Some scholars hold that a\nbody must be either retained or imparted to us, since only the persons\nof the Trinity can subsist without one (e.g., Crouzel 1980); others,\ninvoking the maxim that the end will be like the beginning, argue that\nwe shall return to the incorporeal state in which we were first\ncreated (e.g., Scott 2012, with further discussion of this intricate\ntopic in Blosser 2012 and Rankin 2017). If that is so, the final state\nmust lie beyond the paradise of the saints, of which Origen says in\nthe plainest terms that the church does not hold it to be incorporeal\n(First Principles 2.36; cf. Edwards 2021). In any case, this union\nwith God appears to correspond to the last stage in the perusal of the\nSolomonic canon, and to the \u201cunitive way\u201d of the mystic in\nlater Christian literature. \n\nThis purgatory after death is not confined to those who have died at\npeace with God; if any should fail to be saved, it is not because the\nopportunity to repent has been withdrawn, but because the soul has\nbecome so brutish that it is incapable of amendment (Princ.\n1.5.5). This is the only truth that Origen thinks can be ascribed to\nPlato\u2019s doctrine of transmigration into beasts (Princ.\n3.4.3), and it cannot be presumed that even the demons will remain\nobdurate for ever. Commenting on Paul\u2019s promise that \u201cthe\nlast enemy, death\u201d will be vanquished, Origen surmises that\ndeath will not be annihilated but will cease to molest the saints\n(Princ. 3.6.5). It is generally assumed that the proper\nsubject of this passage is the devil, and the word diabolus\ndoes indeed occur in a ninth-century quotation (Eriugena, Periphyseon,\nPatrologia Latina 122, 930C). On the other hand, in a letter\nto his friends in Alexandria, Origen is said to have exclaimed that\nonly a lunatic would prophesy the salvation of the devil (Crouzel\n1973). Perhaps he means only that Satan is not destined for beatitude;\nthis need not preclude his release from torment on the last after his\npeaceful acquiescence in the victory of God (see Edwards 2010).\n",
