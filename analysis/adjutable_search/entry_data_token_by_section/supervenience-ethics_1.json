    "main_text": "Theorizing Ethical Supervenience || What does the ethical supervene on?\n1.1 What does the ethical supervene on?\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, the idea of ethical supervenience can be made\nto seem plausible despite the fact that it is difficult to provide a\ncharacterization of what the ethical supervenes on that is at\nonce uncontroversial and theoretically interesting (see\n Section 5.4\n for further discussion of this point). This section briefly sketches\nthe options for characterizing what the ethical supervenes on, and\nsome difficulties that these options face.\n\nThe thesis used to introduce supervenience\nabove\u2014Initial\u2014suggested that the ethical supervenes on the\nnatural properties. This is the most common way of\ncharacterizing ethical supervenience in the literature. However, there\nare at least two difficulties with this idea. The first difficulty is\nambiguity: the term \u2018natural\u2019 has been characterized in\nwildly varying terms in metaethics (see the introductory section of\nthe entry on\n moral non-naturalism\n for a brief survey of characterizations of the natural; see McPherson\n2015, \u00a73\u20134 for one constructive proposal). The second\ndifficulty is that on many conceptions of the natural there will be\ncounterexamples to Initial. For example, many philosophers want to\ncontrast natural properties with supernatural\nproperties. Even if we assume that there are no actually instantiated\nsupernatural properties, we might allow that such entities are\npossible. But this might in turn seem to suggest that two\npossible states of affairs could be naturalistically identical, but\nethically different. For example, they might be different because of\nethically significant interactions between supernatural beings (Klagge\n1984, 374\u20135; for some complications see McPherson 2015,\n134\u20135).\n\nThis sort of worry might lead one to reject the common assumption that\nthe ethical supervenes on the natural as misguided; instead,\none might propose that the ethical supervenes on the\nnon-ethical. This might seem promising: the point of the\nembezzling bank manager case might seem to be that there would need to\nbe some non-ethical difference between cases\u2014natural or\nnot\u2014in order for there to be an ethical difference in the bank\nmanager\u2019s actions. However, there is an important worry about\nthis way of characterizing the supervenience base (compare Sturgeon\n2009, 70\u201372), which can be brought out briefly by example. Some\nphilosophers are sympathetic to ambitious reductive hypotheses about\nethics. On one such example, the ethical property of goodness is just\nidentical to the property of pleasantness. Because identicals have all\nof the same properties, this would entail that pleasantness is an\nethical property. Some philosophers also think that certain\nexperiential or \u201cphenomenal\u201d properties, such as\npleasantness, are metaphysically fundamental, such that two possible\ncircumstances could differ only in how much pleasantness they\ncontained. Together, the points entail the conclusion that two worlds\ncould differ from each other solely in an ethical respect: how much\ngoodness/pleasantness they include. This is inconsistent with the\nsupervenience of the ethical on the non-ethical, but it is not clear\nthat we should be prepared to dismiss out of hand the assumptions that\ngenerate this conclusion. This might in turn lead us to think that\nthere can at least be reasonable controversy concerning the\nsupervenience of the ethical on the non-ethical.\n\nOne can avoid this problem by proposing that the ethical supervenes on\nthe distribution of all of the properties. But this\nformulation purchases plausibility at the price of triviality. Ethical\ndifferences are differences, so there can obviously be no ethical\ndifference without some difference. In light of its\ntriviality, this sort of supervenience thesis fails to identify\nanything in ethical supervenience that is of philosophical\ninterest.\n\nAn influential alternative way of characterizing what the ethical\nsupervenes on begins with a distinction in language. Some philosophers\nthink that we can intuitively distinguish between broadly\nevaluative predicates (like \u2018is right\u2019, \u2018is\ngood\u2019, \u2018is virtuous\u2019, etc.) from\ndescriptive predicates (like \u2018is round\u2019,\n\u2018is accelerating\u2019, \u2018is a badger\u2019 etc.). We can\nthen ask about the relationship between the properties that are picked\nout by these two sets of predicates. Frank Jackson has argued that\nthis allows us to state an ethical supervenience thesis: there is no\npossible difference that can be stated using evaluative predicates\nbetween states that are identical with respect to all properties\npicked out by descriptive predicates (1998, 118\u2013125).\n\nJackson\u2019s proposal seemingly avoids triviality, because\nevaluative and descriptive predicates appear to be distinct. However,\nthe detour through language faces significant challenges. One\nchallenge concerns the expressive power of a language like ours: if it\nis limited, then there seemingly might be ethical differences between\nstates of affairs that are not correlated with descriptive differences\nexpressible in a language like ours (for related worries, see Sturgeon\n2009, 73\u201379). A second challenge questions whether the\ndistinction between description and evaluation is characteristically a\ndistinction in the semantic properties of predicates, as Jackson\nassumes. On one contrasting view, evaluation might instead\ncharacteristically be a pragmatic property of whole speech acts (see\nV\u00e4yrynen 2013b for extended defense of this idea for the case of\n\u201cthick\u201d evaluation.)\n\nIn the face of these difficulties, some philosophers have sought to\ndevelop accounts of the class of properties which subvene the ethical\nwhich are substantive enough for ethical supervenience to do\ndialectical work, but avoid some of the difficulties just sketched.\nFor example, it has been proposed that the ethical supervenes on the\ndisjunctive class of non-ethical or descriptive properties\n(Ridge 2007). In the context of discussing arguments concerning\nsupervenience and non-naturalism, it has been proposed that the\nethical supervenes on the set of properties that are not ethical\nproperties as those are understood by the non-naturalist (McPherson\n2012).\n\nThere is a cross-cutting distinction that may be important for our\nthinking about the supervenience of the ethical. Most properties are\nrepeatable, in the sense that they can be possessed by\ndistinct possible individuals. But some properties are not repeatable.\nFor example, the property of being identical to Emad Atiq is\nnot repeatable: it can only be borne by a single individual, across\nmodal space. It appears plausible that the ethical properties\nsupervene on a set of repeatable properties (Atiq forthcoming).\n\nAs this brief survey makes clear, it is not obvious how to\ncharacterize what the ethical supervenes on, in a way that makes an\nethical supervenience thesis both plausible and theoretically\ninteresting. Now that the difficulties here have been made clear\n(especially by Sturgeon 2009), this is an important potential locus\nfor future research. The following discussion largely sets aside these\ndebates, speaking of the supervenience of the ethical properties on\nthe base properties,where \u2018base\u2019 serves as a\nplaceholder for a more illuminating characterization of the class of\nproperties that subvene the ethical.\n",
