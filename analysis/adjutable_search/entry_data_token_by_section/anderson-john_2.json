Difficulties in Understanding Anderson\u2019s Work\n\nGilbert Ryle listed Anderson among the \u201cseniors\u201d who had\npreceded his own generation: philosophers such as Russell, Moore,\nWittgenstein, Bradley, Stout, McTaggart, Alexander, Laird, and Kemp\nSmith. For Ryle, Anderson\u2019s generation represented \u201cthe\nold gang\u201d, many the products of \u201cthose dominating Scots\nteachers\u201d who had established philosophy as an academic\ndiscipline in English-speaking universities around the world. Anderson\nwas an exact contemporary of Wittgenstein and Heidegger, yet only\nseven years older than Ryle himself. But Ryle seems to have a point in\nsuggesting a generational gap that separated him from that earlier\ngeneration\u2019s \u201cpieties, lores, sagacities, equipments\n\u2013 yes, and fetishes too\u201d (Ryle 1976: 383). Ryle was\ndescribing the generation of philosophers who were adult prior to or\nduring the Great War. He only became acquainted with Anderson in the\n1950s and was struck by the manner in which Anderson had continued a\nform of philosophy into modern times that had given way elsewhere to\nphilosophies more concerned with linguistic usage. Despite this\nrecognition of interpretive challenges, for many of Anderson\u2019s\nfollowers Ryle at that time radically misunderstood Anderson\u2019s\nwork (Ryle 1950), reading it from the perspective of the\n\u201clinguistic turn\u201d.\n\nFor current readers there are indeed several obstacles to approaching\nAnderson\u2019s work. His published works, primarily articles for the\nAustralasian Journal of Philosophy and Psychology and in\nlocal journals and newspapers, are difficult without the context of\nAnderson\u2019s broader teaching. They are generally regarded as\nsubsidiary to the lectures and syllabus of an Andersonian\napprenticeship. It seems that they were written for the benefit of the\nstudents who already had the value of his personal contact. Without\nthis contact, we must rely on the publication of several series of\nlecture notes from Anderson\u2019s papers by Sydney University Press\n(see Bibliography). Anderson\u2019s isolation from his intellectual\npeers and his seeming reluctance to engage in international debate\nalso deprives contemporary students of the opportunity to locate his\nwork within more familiar territory.\n\nOne point of access to Anderson\u2019s work for contemporary\nstudents, of course, lies in the work of his students such as D. M.\nArmstrong, John Passmore, and J. L. Mackie. But there is a danger even\nhere that their specialisations may distort our view of\nAnderson\u2019s work as a whole. Anderson, as Passmore noted, was a\ngeneralist (Passmore, Introduction to Anderson\u2019s posthumous\nwork, Studies in Empirical Philosophy, hereafter\nEMP). Unlike the next generation, he expected all\nspheres of philosophical inquiry to open up to his investigation and\nhis philosophy extended to all spheres: logic, metaphysics, ethics,\npolitical thought, aesthetics, education.\n\nAnderson describes his position variously as empiricist, realist,\nnaturalist, physicalist, positivist and pluralist, conceiving each of\nthese as different aspects of the one truly empirical philosophy. But\nhis use of these terms is problematic for the uninitiated.\nAnderson\u2019s empiricism has no time for representational\nviews of truth, nor for the traditional empiricist entities of sense\ndata or ideas. Empiricism for Anderson is an ontological doctrine\nasserting a single way of being to which we as investigators belong.\nWhile undoubtedly committed to empirical investigation and the\nfallible nature of all propositional claims, Anderson\u2019s\nempiricism is only secondarily an epistemological viewpoint relating\nto how we come to know things within this spatio-temporal world.\nAnderson\u2019s realism rejects the traditional\nrealist-nominalist options concerning the existence of universals.\nUniversals are brought down to (spatio-temporal) earth, but there are\nno such things as pure universals nor pure particulars outside their\nroles within complex states of affairs. Mentality is a\nproduct of physico-chemical processes in the brain but this does not\npreclude our inquiry into the nature of mind as a field of conflicted\ntendencies, feelings and emotions. Whatever the special sciences tell\nus about their particular subject matters, philosophy retains its\nauthority in questions of logic, that is to say, concerning the\nconditions of possibility of discourse. Indeed, modern science is\nbadly infected by instrumentalist and technological views of its\ninvestigations and needs to become more truly philosophical and\ncritical, more concerned with establishing what is the case within\nspecific fields, and less with being practical and useful in relation\nto perceived societal needs (EMP, 290).\nPositivism then is for Anderson a commitment to what is\nobjectively and positively the case, and not a program of instrumental\nor operational truth, nor a means of distinguishing meaningful from\nmeaningless utterances. Anderson\u2019s call for a \u201cscience of\nethics\u201d is not an assimilation of ethical inquiry to the\nstandards of the special sciences. It is a plea for an objective\ninvestigation of the ethical, focussed on the existing ethical\nqualities of human activities, rather than on the pieties of\ntraditional moral philosophy: the questions of right, obligation, duty\nand so forth. \n\nRyle was only the first of many to be accused of misreading Anderson.\nCriticisms of Anderson\u2019s position from within mainstream\nEnglish-language philosophy have always seemed to his followers to\nmiss their mark. They have generally failed to recognise the\nontological, non-representational, non-semantic basis for his\nempiricism. Robert Brandom\u2019s recent criticism and rejection of\nthe \u201ctheoretical, explanatory and strategic commitments\u201d\nmotivating Anglo-American philosophy in the 20th century lists these\nas: empiricism, naturalism, representationalism, semantic atomism,\nformalism about logic, instrumentalism about practical norms (Brandom\n2000). Anderson would reject all of these criticisms of his own work\nas they stand. Brandom regards the notion of \u201cfacts\u201d and\n\u201cstates of affairs\u201d as emblematic of atomistic,\nrepresentationalist thought. Anderson would have replied imperiously\nas he did to Gilbert Ryle\u2019s \u201crepresentationist\u201d\ncriticisms: \u201cThat is nothing to me\u201d. \n\nMany of the problems contemporary readers encounter in\nAnderson\u2019s work result from his relative international\nisolation. But for many of his students it was precisely\nAnderson\u2019s secessionist traditional stance that was the key to\nthe great value of an Andersonian education. He may have failed in his\nproject, but he kept alive at Sydney enduring values of traditional\nphilosophical inquiry at a time when mainstream philosophy was either\nobsessed with linguistic usage on the one hand or in deference to the\nnatural sciences on the other. Many of Anderson\u2019s students\nexpected his philosophy to re-emerge stronger following the inevitable\ndecline of linguistic philosophy and the renewed interest in\nmetaphysical questions which followed this decline. But if his work\nplayed any role in this renewal it was only indirectly through the\nwork of his student D. M. Armstrong. Contemporary philosophers\ninterested in metaphysical questions do not refer to Anderson\u2019s\nwork and are frankly baffled by Armstrong\u2019s enthusiasm for his\nteacher\u2019s work. Anderson exists today almost exclusively in the\nfootnotes of his more engaged and accomplished students.\n",
