    "main_text": "The Rights and Duties of Gamete Donors || The Transferability of Parental Responsibilities\n1.3 The Transferability of Parental Responsibilities\n\nOne way we might sidestep concerns about the parental status of gamete\ndonors is to argue that parental responsibilities can be transferred\nto others. If such transfers are possible then presumably gamete\ndonors do so when they make their gametes available to others. That\nsuch transfers are at least sometimes possible is a view that is held\nby many (O\u2019Neill 1979; Bayne 2003; Fuscaldo 2006; Benatar\n1999). Those who defend the transferability of parental\nresponsibilities argue that parents often transfer some of their\nresponsibilities to others, such as school teachers, nannies, and\ndoctors. So long as gamete donors have reason to believe that those to\nwhom the responsibilities are transferred will do an adequate job,\nsuch transfers are unproblematic. On this view, we ought to treat\ngamete donation as a comprehensive transfer of responsibilities that\nis no different in kind from these other commonplace transfers of\nresponsibility. However, accepting the transferability of parental\nresponsibilities does not imply that current practice is morally\npermissible. We might think that many gamete donors fail to take the\nnecessary steps to ensure that their biological offspring will be\nadequately reared (Benatar 1999). \n\nThe transferability of parental responsibilities is however\ncontroversial. Many argue that the move from some transfers of\nresponsibility to the complete abdication of parental responsibility\nis too quick (Velleman 2008; Weinberg 2008; Nelson 1991; Brandt 2016).\nFor instance, Velleman (2008) argues that while adoption is acceptable\nwhen there is no other means to provide a child with an adequate life,\nthis should not be confused with the intentional creation of children\nwhose social link to their genetic parents will be severed. Because\nVelleman believes that preserving the social connection between\nchildren and genetic parents is important for the wellbeing of\nchildren, he argues that, unless there is pressing reason to do\notherwise, children ought to be parented by their genetic\nprogenitors.\n\nWeinberg (2008) argues that parental responsibilities cannot be\ntransferred in full because certain kinds of intimate responsibilities\ncan only be fulfilled by particular individuals: individuals in the\nright intimate relationship. For instance, parents cannot transfer the\nobligation to celebrate their children\u2019s achievements to others\nby having strangers attend their children\u2019s music recitals or\naward ceremonies. Weinberg thinks that gamete donors have a\nresponsibility to love their children and that the responsibility to\nlove a particular person is paradigmatic of the kind that cannot be\ntransferred. Consequently, at least some parental responsibilities are\nnot transferable.\n\nBrandt (2006) disputes the claim that partial transfers of parental\nresponsibilities are commonplace. When a responsibility is delegated\nbut not transferred, the individual delegating the responsibility must\nstill ensure that the responsibility is fulfilled. For instance,\nparents have a duty to ensure that their children are in fact\nreceiving proper education from their teachers, and must take\ncorrective measures if this is not the case. The duty to educate is\nthus delegated to teachers, but not transferred to them. In general, the\nexamples offered to show that partial transfers of parental\nresponsibility are commonplace tend to be in fact examples of\ndelegation. This undermines the claim that a complete transfer of\nparental responsibility is merely an extension of already accepted\npractices because it is delegation that is the norm, not transfer.\n\n",
