    "main_text": "Principal Contributions || Religion\n3.3 Religion\n\nBosanquet\u2019s philosophical views on religion were in large part\ninfluenced by early nineteenth century biblical\nstudies\u2014initially, mediated through the writings of Green,\nEdward Caird, and Benjamin Jowett.\n\nThe work of David Strauss, Ferdinand Baur, and others, at the\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, marked a turn in the scholarly\napproach to religion and scripture, towards what is now called\n\u2018the scientific study of religion\u2019. Religious experience,\nsacred texts, and religious practice were now to be seen as phenomena\nopen to critical investigation and which could\u2014and\nshould\u2014be examined independently of one\u2019s religious\ncommitment, and according to the principles of literary and historical\nanalysis. Strauss and his followers challenged the tendency to equate\nreligious dogmas and creeds with original religious experience, and\nthey were particularly doubtful whether one could recover much\nknowledge of such experience from \u2018events\u2019 recorded in\nscripture.\n\nBy the mid-nineteenth century, this approach to the study of religion\nhad established itself in Britain, particularly in Oxford. Figures\nsuch as Jowett and Caird, and others in the Church of England\n\u2018Broad Church movement\u2019 (such as Frederick Temple, Bishop\nJ.W. Colenso, and Thomas Arnold) argued for a more analytical and\nrational approach to understanding religious belief\u2014though they\nwere frequently criticised for this by Church authorities.\n\nThe distinction of practice from dogma and experience from creeds was,\nhowever, also a feature of the evangelical movement within the Church\nof England. Bosanquet, like many of his fellow idealists, was raised\nin an Evangelical household; his later philosophical views, then, can\nbe seen as an evolution, rather than an interruption or contradiction,\nof his early religious convictions.\n\nDespite his conventional religious upbringing, Bosanquet was not an\northodox Christian. While he did claim that religion was not only\ncentral to one\u2019s life, but was that which made life worth\nliving, he held that, taken literally or at face value, many\nparticular religious beliefs are either incoherent or false. Bosanquet\nnotes that, in religion, \u201crationalism, curiosity, metaphor, and\ndeduction from metaphor, operate by way of distortion\u201d (What\nReligion Is, p. 68), and that, to help one read biblical texts,\none must engage in a hermeneutical enterprise, and \u201clearn to\ninterpret\u201d them\u2014though, even here, he doubted whether\n\u201cthe sacred books of a Church\u201d can ever be\n\u201cunderstood in their actual meaning\u201d (Essays and\nAddresses, p. 132). Moreover, some religious beliefs do not mean\nwhat many take them to mean. Bosanquet argues, for example, that, if\nwe examine the idea of God\u2014who is often described as an\n\u2018infinite individual\u2019\u2014we will find that to attribute\n\u2018infinity\u2019 to a being would be inconsistent with\n\u201cevery predicate which we attach to personality\u201d. Finally,\nBosanquet held that religious belief in general is not about some\nsupernatural being or transcendent realm, entering into our daily\nlives. It focuses, rather, on what takes place in the world. His\nanalysis of religion and religious belief is, then,\n\u2018immanentist\u2019.\n\nBosanquet distinguished religious beliefs about particular persons or\nevents from \u2018religion\u2019 (or, what was the same thing for\nhim, \u2018faith\u2019 or \u2018religious consciousness\u2019).\nStill, he did not see himself as either an agnostic or atheist, or as\nreducing \u2018religion\u2019 to the \u2018ethical\u2019. While he\nstates that there is much in Christianity that is no longer\nintelligible, he insists that religion\u2014in the sense of religious\nconsciousness\u2014is needed for morality, and that an ethics cut off\nfrom religion is \u201cwithout sap or life\u201d. Similarly,\nBosanquet\u2019s opposition to seeing religion or religious belief as\na faith in something supernatural does not mean that he denied the\nexistence of the spiritual or held a reductionist view of reality.\nWhen it comes to human consciousness, he argued, the\nspiritual\u2014the \u2018inward\u2019 transfiguration of the\n\u2018outward\u2019 aspects of life\u2014is at least as much a part\nof what exists as the visible and material. This\n\u2018infinite\u2019 here is what Bosanquet called the\n\u2018Absolute\u2019.\n\nHuman beings are, Bosanquet noted, aware of something infinite that\nbears directly on their lives, and in his entry on Philosophy of\nReligion, for J.M. Baldwin\u2019s Dictionary of Philosophy and\nPsychology (1902), he writes that it is this awareness, and\none\u2019s commitment to \n\n\nthat set of objects, habits, and convictions, whatever it might prove\nto be, which [one] would rather die for than abandon, or at least\nwould feel himself excommunicated from humanity if he did abandon \n\n\nthat constitutes what religion is (Collected Works, vol. 1,\np. 33). (While some idealists, such as Pringle-Pattison, seem to have\nheld that such an Absolute is God, Bosanquet did not\u2014though\nneither does he explicitly reject the existence of God.) Still,\nreligious belief is neither the same as, nor tied essentially to,\nrituals and practices. Neither does it require adherence or assent to\na set of propositions or dogmas\u2014and certainly not to a set of\npropositions focusing on beings or events in the history of a\ncommunity of believers. Religious belief is, in short, quite distinct\nfrom theism. In this, Bosanquet brings to completion views\ncharacteristic of many of the nineteenth-century British idealist\nphilosophers (see Sweet 2014).\n\nWhile one finds religious belief and religious consciousness\nthroughout history and throughout the world, Bosanquet rejects the\nview that all religions are on a par. Religious consciousness has\nevolved, and higher forms of religion\u2014i.e., those which show a\nunity of the Divine and human nature\u2014are the more\n\u2018true\u2019. What Bosanquet is ultimately interested in, then,\nis religion in its highest or most developed form\u2014what Caird\ncalled \u201cAbsolute Religion\u201d. Though Bosanquet does not\ndevelop what, specifically, this means, his Gifford lectures give some\nhint as to the direction of his thought.\n\nDespite his criticisms of, and challenges to, Christianity, Bosanquet\nbelieved that the world had benefitted from Christian civilisation and\nculture, and that Christianity was a progress over earlier stages of\nreligion. Moreover, he not only frequently employed allusions to\nChristian religious belief and practice to illustrate his general\nviews, but retained elements from Christian doctrine, such as the\nideas of the atonement and of justification by faith\u2014though in a\nhighly modified form. The doctrines of the atonement (to which\nBosanquet often referred, using the words of Goethe, as \u2018dying\nin order to live\u2019) and of \u2018justification by faith\u2019\n(which emphasised the presence of religious consciousness in\n\u2018works\u2019) have a practical rather than a doctrinal\nsignificance. The former reflected the notion of\n\u2018self-sacrifice\u2019, involved in the achievement of\nself-realisation\u2014where one had to \u2018die\u2019 to the\ndesires of one\u2019s \u2018private will\u2019 in order to\n\u2018live\u2019 as a more complete moral agent. And the latter was\na reminder that one\u2019s actions could have a moral and spiritual\ncharacter only so far as they were carried out, out of a set of\n\u201cdominant ideas\u201d to which one was committed.\n\nGiven his explanation of what religion is, Bosanquet holds that\nreligion is entirely consistent with reason. He insists that religious\nbelief as a whole is not superstition, and that it is true so far as\nit is an expression of a \u201cnisus towards the whole\u201d\n(Principle of Individuality and Value, p. 98). Again, since\nparticular religious beliefs purport to be cognitive, they must, at\nleast in principle, be able to be known by believers and non-believers\nalike. (He is, however, sceptical about the relevance of traditional\napologetics.) In both cases, the standard that Bosanquet employs in\norder to assess truth in religion is the same as that which he uses to\nassess the truth in general\u2014namely, coherence.\n\nIn his 2006 The God of Metaphysics, T.L.S. Sprigge endorses a\nbroadly Bosanquetian account of religion, but raises a number of\ncriticisms of Bosanquet\u2019s account\u2014particularly concerning\nits implications for ethics. Sprigge argues, for example, that by his\nassimilation of evil into the Absolute, Bosanquet not only fails to\ntake evil seriously, but encourages passivity, assuming that evil is\neither inevitable or will eventually disappear on its own. The claim\nthat Bosanquet\u2019s absolute idealism entails such an attitude\ntowards evil seems difficult, however, to square with\nBosanquet\u2019s concern for public welfare and interest in social\nreform (see Sweet 2007). \n\nThough Bosanquet\u2019s analysis of religious belief reflects an\nunderstanding that, broadly speaking, was shared by a number of his\nfellow idealists, it is significantly different from other late\n19th century and early 20th century\nperspectives, such as those of William Clifford, John Henry Newman,\nand William James, and can be seen as an alternative to them. Given\nits immanentist character and insistence on separating religion or\nfaith from dogma and theology, it is close to the view of religion\nthat one finds in twentieth-century authors, such as R.B. Braithwaite,\nR.M. Hare, and W. Cantwell Smith. Bosanquet\u2019s views, like those\nof these authors, have been challenged (for example, by C.C.J. Webb,\nFran\u00e7ois Houang, and Alan P.F. Sell) for not only being\ninconsistent with any orthodox theism, but as presenting in its stead\na non-realist, generic religion (which, some critics hold, is not\nreligion at all). It is, however, important to recognise that\nBosanquet is not advancing a non-cognitivist or fideist view of\nreligion, and that he maintains that both religious belief as a whole\nand particular religious beliefs must meet appropriate rational\nstandards (see Sweet 2000).\n",
