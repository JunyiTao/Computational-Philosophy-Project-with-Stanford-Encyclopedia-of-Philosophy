    "main_text": "Religious Views || Boyle on arguments for the existence of God\n2.1 Boyle on arguments for the existence of God\n\nApart from a brief reference to it in the printed works Boyle does not\nmention the ontological argument (BW 9:413; Boyle 1772,\n4:461\u20132). This distancing was not uncommon at the time. Ralph\nCudworth, though clearly fascinated by the ontological argument,\nrecognized that most would \u201cDistrust, the Firmness and\nSolidity of such thin and Subtle\nCobwebs,\u201d and offered an alternative argument in the\nhope that it would prove more \u201cConvictive of the\nExistence of a God to the Generality\u201d (Cudworth 1678,\n725).\n\nThe language of the ontological argument was acceptable, even when the\nargument\u2019s validity was rejected. Gassendi, for example, agreed\nthat God is that than which nothing greater can be conceived, but\ndenied the validity of the argument which offers this as its main\npremise (See further Osler 1994, ch. 2). Nor was the argument from\ninnate ideas more popular. After his dialogue character Cuphophron has\nespoused it, Henry More has his down to earth Hylobares burst out:\n\nWell, Cuphophron, you may hug your self in your high\nMetaphysicall Acropolis as much as you will, and\ndeem those Arguments fetched from the frame of Nature mean and\npopular: but for my part, I look upon them as the most sound and solid\nPhilosophicall Arguments that are for the proving the Existence of a\nGod (More 1668,\n 53).[20]\n\n\nBoyle, too, held that design arguments were both available and the\nmost likely to persuade rational, open-minded hearers. Such arguments\nwere intended to form a large part of a book on atheism, something he\nworked on throughout his adult life but never published, though parts\nof it were used in various other works of a theological\n nature.[21]\n Boyle did, however, leave a plan of the intended work, and in the\nmanuscript remains \u2014 seven volumes of correspondence, forty-six\nvolumes of miscellaneous papers and eighteen volumes of notebooks\n\u2014 there are still a number of unpublished fragments and some\nlonger selections which he intended for this work.\n\nBoyle intended \u201cthe little Tract about Atheism\u201d to have\nthree sections:\n\n\nIn the First of these, the Author represents some Reasons why it\nshould not be thought strange if it be found somewhat difficult to\ndemonstrate the Existence of a Deity.\n\nThe First of these Reasons is, that by reason of the selfe\nexistence and Primity of God, his Essence cannot be Causable.\nThe Vitious Affections & Habits and the depravd frame of mind\nto be met with in most Atheists do very much indispose them to be\nconvinc\u2019d by the proofes of a Deity that might other wise be\nsufficient.\nSince God is a Being whose Nature is the most singular of all,\nthere must necessarily belong to him divers things, not to be\nparalleld.\nThe Difficulty of such speculations as belong to the\nContemplations of Gods Attributes keeps the generality of Atheists\n& Libertines from being qualifyed for such Enquiries.\n\n\n\nIn the second section <the Author> haveing premisd, that the\nforegoing Reasons make it Equitable not to expect metaphysical or\nrigid Demonstrations of a Deity, but to be content with a moral one,\nif no better can be had, proceeds to the mediums whereof such a\nDemonstration can be made up. Such as are\n\nThe innate Idea of a Deity\n\n\nThe general Consent of mankind. (To one of which or both may be\nreferrd the Epicurean Anticipation.)\n\nThe Reproaches or Boadings & Disquieting Terrors of a Guilty\nConscience\n\nThe Fabrick & Conservation of the world, especially of Animals\n\nThe Nature & Propertys of the Soul of Man\n\nThe Lawes of its Union with the\n Body[22]\n\nThe Universal Providence that directs the Affairs of Mankind.\n\nSupernatural Effects whether of good or Evil Spirits (as their\nApparitions Action Oracles Predictions &c)\n\nThe Patefactions that God has made of himselfe by true miracles. (To\nwhich Prophecies are reduc\u2019d.)\n\n\nThe Third section is spent in shewing some of the Reasons why the\nArguments proposd in the Second are often unprevalent.\n\nAnd among the Intellectual Impediments the First is, That Atheists\noften injuriously attribute to the notion of a Deity the fond Opinions\nor rash Assertions of unskillfull men.\nAtheists on the other side do sometimes no less injuriously father\ntheir owne Errors & mistakes on the notion of a Deity.\nThey do not equitably consider the Nature of the Thing to be\nproved, & the necessity that thence arises, that the Theory of the\nDivine Attributes should be lyable to specious Objections.\nThey do not duely consider, that their owne Hypothesis is lyable\nto some of the same difficulties & Objections, and to others that\nthey cannot solve.\nThe Objections are more popular & easy that are to be made\nagainst the notion of a Deity than the Answers to those Objections\n& the Arguments which prove that Notion.\n\n\nWell, that was the plan, and Boyle certainly thought that the design\narguments he intended for section two should convince the open-minded.\nMoreover, he thought, such arguments should particularly convince\nthose who were knowledgeable about nature, who knew enough about the\ndetails of the world to be impressed by the intricacy of the\npresumed workmanship. \u201c[T]here are,\u201d he wrote,\n\u201cpositive Reasons afforded by Philosophy to prove a Deity,\nnamely \u2026 the Cartesian Id\u00e6a, the Originall of Motion, the\nuse of Parts in Animalls, especially the Eye, the valves of the heart,\nthe musculi perforantes &\n perforati,[23]\n & the temporary\n [parts][24]\n of a foetus <& the Mother>.\u201d\n\nThe argument from design, said Kant, \u201calways deserves to be\nmentioned with respect. It is the oldest, the clearest, and the most\naccordant with the common reason of mankind\u201d (Kant 1781,\nA623/B651). But, he pointed out, there was a problem with it, a\nproblem which in fact had already been pointed not only by David\n Hume,[25]\n but by Boyle\u2019s younger contemporary, Charles Blount, who\nwrote,\n\ncould we conclude any thing from Miracles, yet we could never\nthence conclude of the Existence of God. For since a Miracle\nis Work limited, and never implies any but a certain and\nlimited Power: most certain and evident it is, that from such an\nEffect we cannot rightly infer the Existence of a Cause whose Power is\ninfinite, but at most of a Cause whose Power is greater: I\nsay, at most; because from many Causes concurring there may\nfollow some Work, whose Force and Power is indeed less than the Power\nof all its Causes put together, but far greater than the Power of any\none of them taken singularly (Blount 1683, 11).\n\n\nTo a large extent Boyle accepted these points. He notes explicitly\nthat none of the proofs he was prepared to offer amounted to a\ndemonstration of God\u2019s existence, and indeed he felt\nthat a demonstration was not possible. A\ndemonstration was typically held to proceed from necessarily\ntrue premises (often Aristotelian\n principles[26])\n via a valid argument to a necessarily true conclusion, and part of\nwhat was at issue was whether we should be looking for a demonstration\nof God\u2019s existence, or something less which would nonetheless\nstill be useful in the fight against atheism . \u201cTo haue the\nScience of a thing,\u201d said Pierre du Moulin the elder, \u201ctwo\ncertainties are required. The one is, that the thing be certaine of it\nselfe and unchangeable. The second is, that the perswasion which wee\nhaue of it be firme and cleare\u201d (Du Moulin 1624, 162). Gassendi\nagreed, as did Arnauld and Nicole in the Port Royal Logic (Gassendi\n1658, Canon XVI, 144; Arnauld 1662, part IV, ch 8, 323\u20134,\npagination as in the 5th, 1683 edition).\n\nThe persuasive alternative to a demonstration was sometimes styled a\nproof, but often people spoke of moral\ndemonstrations as opposed to strict, or mathematical, demonstrations.\nBoyle wrote:\n\nbesides the Demonstrations wont to be treated of in vulgar Logick,\nthere are among Philosophers three distinct, whether kinds or\ndegrees, of Demonstration. For there is a\nMetaphysical Demonstration, as we may call that, where the\nConclusion is manifestly built on those general Metaphysical Axioms,\nthat can never be other than true; such as Nihil potest simul esse\n& non esse \u2026 &c. (Nothing can both be and not be\nat the same time) There are also Physical Demonstrations,\nwhere the Conclusion is evidently deduc\u2019d from Physical\nPrinciples; such as \u2026 Ex nihilo nihil fit \u2026\n&c. (From nothing, nothing comes) which are not so absolutely\ncertain as the former, because, if there be a God, He may (at least\nfor ought we know) be able to create & annihilate Substances\n\u2026. And lastly, there are Moral Demonstrations \u2026\nwhere the Conclusion is built, either upon some one such\nproof cogent in its kind, or some concurrence of Probabilities, that\nit cannot but be allowed, supposing the truth of the most\nreceiv\u2019d Rules of Prudence and Principles of Practical\nPhilosophy.\n\n\nAnd this third kind of Probation, though it come behind the\ntwo others in certainty, yet it is the surest guide, which the\nActions of Men, though not their Contemplations,\nhave regularly allow\u2019d them to follow (BW, 8:281; Boyle 1772,\n4:182\u20133).\n\n\nThis moral certainty, Locke remarked, \u201cis not only as great as\nour frame can attain to, but as our Condition needs\u201d (Locke\n1690, 4.11.8).\n\nWhen we look in detail at Boyle\u2019s discussions of the various\nmoral demonstrations outlined in his proposed second section it\nbecomes clear that he fancied some considerably more than others. He\noften mentions the importance of conscience, but concentrates, as far\nas proofs go, on various design arguments, on arguments based on the\nincorporeality of the human soul, and on arguments involving miracles.\nUnlike the clerical authors of the time he pays little or no attention\nto the arguments from \u201cthe innate Idea of the Deity,\u201d from\n\u201cthe general Consent of Mankind,\u201d or from \u201cthe\nUniversal Providence that directs the Affairs of Mankind.\u201d\n\nBoyle did not expect his (or anyone\u2019s) proofs to convince most\natheists:\n\nyou need not thinke it strange, that I never pretended to convert\nresolved Atheists. For, besides the difficulty of treating clearly and\ncogently of such abstruse subjects as are many that relate to Atheism;\nthe Will and Affections have so great an influence upon some mens\nUnderstandings, that \u2019tis almost as difficult to make them\nbeleive, as to make them Love, against their Will.\nAnd it must be a very dazzleing Light, that makes an impression upon\nthose that obstinately shut their Eyes against it. \u2019Tis not by\nGods ordinary workes, but by his Extraordinary Power, that such men\nmust be reclaimd to an acknowledgement of his <Existence>. For\nthey that would find the Truth, especially in matters of Religion,\nmust be diligent Inquirers after it, and may be strict\nExaminers of it, but must not beresolved Enemies to it. For\nto such, if to any, God is a Sun, that is not to be discover\u2019d\nbut by <his> owne Light (BP 2:64, BOA \u00a74.6.9 , p 384).\n\n",
