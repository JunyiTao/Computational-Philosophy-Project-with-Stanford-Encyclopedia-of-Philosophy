    "main_text": "Liberal vs Common Good Constitutionalism\n11. Liberal vs Common Good Constitutionalism\n\nOne\u2019s understanding of how constitutions limit power and how\nthey ought to be interpreted depends, as noted above, on one\u2019s\nconception of their role. For some, that role must be set against the\nbackground of the value pluralism that is characteristic of many\nmodern societies. In light of this pluralism, they say, constitutions\nshould not be committed to a particular understanding of the good but\nshould, rather, serve to guarantee those essentials of political\njustice adherence to which is necessary for legitimating government\npower to citizens who hold a variety of comprehensive doctrines, that\nis, conceptions of justice and the good life. This so-called\n\u2018liberal principle of legitimacy\u2019 is taken to issue in an\naustere list of \u2018constitutional essentials\u2019 (Rawls 1996,\n227ff; Michelman 2022, 51ff; Sager 2004, ch 8). According to one\nsuggestion, the liberal principle of legitimacy sits more comfortably\nwith the fixed view of constitutions and their meaning. Arguably, it\nis better served when the interpretation of constitutional essentials\ntrack their \u2018central range\u2019 (Rawls 1996, 273), thus\npresumably eliciting broad convergence. However, for other authors\nsuch as Michelman, the liberal principle of legitimacy might in fact\nbe satisfied by a certain mode of constitutional argument, one\noriented towards reciprocity, even when its application to concrete\nconstitutional issues is disputed (Michelman 2022, 105 ff). In this\npicture, reciprocity takes seriously the fact of value pluralism and\nthe corresponding requirement that constitutional arrangements be\nacceptable to all. But its precise contours are sensitive to the\nsuitably constrained moral judgment of citizens and officials.\n\nOpposing this approach is common good constitutionalism, according to\nwhich constitutions, even of pluralistic societies like the United\nStates, are geared towards advancing \u2013 and must be interpreted in\nlight of \u2013 a robust, unitary vision of the common good of society.\nAccording to its foremost contemporary proponent, Adrian Vermeule,\nconstitutions and constitutional interpretation \u201cshould be based\non the principles that government helps direct persons, associations,\nand society generally toward the common good, and that strong rule in\nthe interest of attaining the common good is entirely\nlegitimate\u201d (Vermeule 2020). More specifically:\n\n[t]his approach should take as its starting point substantive moral\nprinciples that conduce to the common good, principles that officials\n(including, but by no means limited to, judges) should read into the\nmajestic generalities and ambiguities of the written Constitution.\nThese principles include \u2026 a candid willingness to\n\u2018legislate morality\u2019 \u2013 indeed, a recognition that\nall legislation is necessarily founded on some substantive conception\nof morality, and that the promotion of morality is a core and\nlegitimate function of authority. Such principles promote the common\ngood and make for a just and well-ordered society. (Vermeule 2020)\n\n\nVermeule\u2019s constitutional theory, further developed in his\nCommon Good Constitutionalism, arguably represents a new\nalternative to the constitutional theories discussed above. But\nperhaps not. Vermeule himself characterizes his view as\n\u2018methodologically Dworkinian,\u2019 noting that it\n\u201cadvocates a very different set of substantive moral commitments\nand priorities from Dworkin\u2019s, which were of a conventionally\nleft-liberal bent\u201d (Vermeule 2020). This may lead one to wonder\nwhether Vermeule\u2019s theory truly is an alternative to\nDworkin\u2019s theory of constitutions and their interpretation, or\ninstead an alternative account of the conclusions Dworkin\u2019s\nideal judge, Hercules, (a mythical judge who always gets things right\nand whose decisions set the standard fallible judges strive to meet)\nwould draw were he to set out to offer a grand interpretation of US\nconstitutional law. (On Hercules, see Dworkin 1986, 239 ff.) Whatever\nanswer one provides to this question, it is nevertheless worth\nconsidering whether the moral vision underlying Vermeule\u2019s\ncommon good constitutionalism is one that only religious conservatives\nwho share his moral views can endorse. And if it is, then should it\nframe our understanding of the nature and role of the constitutions of\nwestern liberal democracies? There is also the concern that common\ngood constitutionalism has the potential to untether constitutional\ninterpretation from both constitutional text and constitutional\nprecedent, thus providing judges with far too much power to use the\nlaw to further that particular moral vision.
