    "main_text": "Voluntary Action, Moral Responsibility, and What is \u201cUp to Us\u201d || Aristotle on voluntary action\n2.1 Aristotle on voluntary action\n\nThe first extended treatment of moral responsibility is\nAristotle\u2019s in NE 3.1\u20135. Voluntary actions, says\nAristotle, are subject to praise and blame, whereas involuntary ones\nare excused (NE 3.1 1109b30\u201332). Voluntary actions are ones\nwith their origin in the agent themself, where they know the\nparticular circumstances of the action (NE 3.1 1111a23\u201324).\nTo say that the origin of an action is the agent simply means that the\ncause or explanation of an action is the person\u2019s own beliefs,\ndesires, states of character, and other psychological states. If I\ndecide to poison my mother for the sake of getting my inheritance, the\naction of putting cyanide into a mug of chamomile and almond tea can\nbe explained by my greed and callousness, by my resulting desire for\nthe inheritance and disregard for the welfare of my mother, and by my\nbelief that poisoning my mother would be an effective means to\nobtaining the inheritance. On the other hand, forced actions are\ninvoluntary\u2014for instance, the movement of a sea voyager who is\nblown astray by a wind or carried away by kidnappers. In such cases,\nthe person\u2019s movements have an external origin, and they\nthemself don\u2019t contribute anything to their movements.\n\nBesides force, another excusing condition is non-culpable ignorance of\nparticular matters of fact regarding the circumstances of the action.\nIf my mother\u2019s joints are aching, and I bring her some Tylenol\ncapsules that, unbeknownst to me, have been laced with cyanide, I\nshould not be blamed for her death. Even though my action of bringing\nthe capsules has an \u201cinternal origin\u201d, I did not willingly\nkill my mother\u2014rather, it was inadvertent, and my action evinces\nno malevolent desires or character flaws. (Nonetheless, says\nAristotle, I should regret what I have done and feel pain at it. If I\ndo not, then something is wrong with me, and so the action is not\nentirely involuntary, but \u201cnon-voluntary\u201d (NE 3.1\n1110b18\u201324).) But not all ignorance excuses. For instance, if I\nwillingly get drunk, and therefore I don\u2019t notice a stop sign\nand end up inadvertently harming somebody when I run the stop sign, I\nam responsible for putting myself into the state of ignorance, and\nhence responsible for my subsequent actions. Also, Aristotle believes\nthat ignorance of what is good and bad does not excuse a person. If I am\ndepraved enough, I might sincerely believe that I am doing nothing\nwrong when I poison my mother, that I am simply being savvy and\nappropriately ruthless in pursuing my self-interest. That\nkind of ignorance, says Aristotle, is what makes people vicious, and\nbeing a bad person isn\u2019t an excuse for acting badly (NE\n3.1 110b28\u20131111a2). (As we shall see, Aristotle believes that people\nare at least partly responsible for their own characters.)\n\nAristotle also discusses \u201cmixed actions\u201d, ones that are\ndone knowingly but unwillingly. He gives the examples of a captain\ntossing their cargo overboard to save their ship during a storm, and a\nperson doing something dishonorable at the order of a tyrant in order\nto save the lives of their family. These are not the sorts of actions\nthey would normally perform, but they feel forced to do so under the\ncircumstances. Such actions, says Aristotle, are voluntary,\nand the agent is responsible for them\u2014after all, the origin of\nthe action was inside the agent, and they knew the particular\ncircumstances of their actions. However, when assessing actions, we\nneed to take those circumstances in account, so that actions that\nnormally would be wrong, like tossing cargo overboard, are sometimes\nactually praiseworthy and reflect well on the agent.\n\nFinally, Aristotle says that sometimes people do wrong actions\n\u201cunder pressure which overstrains human nature and which no one\ncould withstand\u201d, and such actions are forgiven (NE 3.1\n1110a23\u201325). Unfortunately, he does not give an example or explain why\nsuch actions are pardoned. But a plausible example would be in the\nnovel 1984, when Winston Smith betrays his lover Julia at the\npoint where O\u2019Brien threatens to have his face chewed off by\nrats, after months of torture in the bowels of the Ministry of Love.\nWhile the betrayal does have an \u201cinternal origin\u201d in\nSmith\u2019s terror of the rats and his belief that betraying Julia\nwould spare him, almost any human being would have been broken under\nthe circumstances. Therefore, when we wish to explain why Smith\nbetrays Julia, it is not because of any character flaws or disordered\ndesires particular to Smith\u2014instead, we say that no matter\nwhether a person was virtuous or vicious, they would have acted as\nSmith did in such a situation, so Smith\u2019s betrayal doesn\u2019t reflect\nbadly on him.\n\nWhen an action is voluntary and its origin is within us, it is up to\nus either to perform the action or not (NE 3.1 1110a17\u201318),\nso if it\u2019s up to us to perform some action which is noble, we\nalso have the ability not to act, which would be base (NE 3.5\n1113b5\u201314). Since we have the ability to do otherwise in the case of\nall voluntary actions, and it is only for voluntary actions that\npeople are rightly held responsible, Aristotle endorses the Principle\nof Alternate Possibilities (PAP): a person is morally responsible for\nwhat they have done only if they could have done otherwise.\n\nWhether Aristotle\u2019s theory of what is voluntary is compatibilist\nor incompatibilist with regard to causal determinism is highly\ncontested. But the question itself may be misguided, as Aristotle\nnever formulates the thesis of causal determinism or asks whether\ndeterminism is compatible with people engaging in voluntary actions.\nThe best we can do is ask whether, given his other philosophical\ncommitments, Aristotle\u2019s conditions on voluntary action are best\nunderstood as compatible with determinism, or incompatible with it.\nSome contemporary philosophers believe that causal determinism is\nincompatible with an agent genuinely being the source of his action,\nas his action could be traced back to environmental, genetic, and\nother factors outside of and prior to the agent. But Aristotle seems\nnot to be working with that strong a notion of sourcehood when he says\nthat the agent is the origin of his actions: he says that choice is\norigin of action, while desire and practical reason are the origin of\nchoice (NE 6.2 1139a32\u201333). So Y can be the origin of Z,\nwhile Y itself has an origin in X. Likewise, many philosophers believe\nthat PAP is incompatible with causal determinism, while others believe\nthat they are compatible. Aristotle himself is silent on the issue,\nand he never produces an explication of what exactly he means when he\nsays an agent who acts voluntarily could have done otherwise. However,\nhe does think that virtue is a perfection of a person\u2019s\ncharacter, one that reliably produces virtuous actions. The virtuous\nperson has both correct beliefs about what to do, and correct desires,\nso he would seem to have no motive to do anything other than the right\nthing, and Aristotle does say that the virtuous person would never\nvoluntarily do anything vicious (NE 4.9 1128b25\u201330). So it\nseems that, while the virtuous person who voluntarily performs a\nvirtuous action could have acted otherwise and done something\nvicious, nonetheless there are sufficient conditions\u2014ones that\ninclude his own virtue\u2014which preclude him from exercising this\nability. While opinions on the question are divided, perhaps the\nsafest thing to say is that Aristotle\u2019s theory is compatible\nwith compatibilism. (See Destr\u00e9e (2011) for an incompatibilist\ninterpretation of Aristotle based on \u2018sourcehood\u2019 and\nAristotle\u2019s acceptance of PAP, and Bobzien (2014) for\ncriticisms. Meyer (2011) gives an interpretation on which\nAristotle\u2019s theory of voluntary action and of character\nformation is compatible with compatibilism.)\n",
