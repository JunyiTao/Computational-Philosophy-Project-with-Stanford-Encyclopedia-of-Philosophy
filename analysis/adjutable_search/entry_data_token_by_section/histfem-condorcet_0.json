    "main_text": "Political Context\n1. Political Context\n\nGender equality was not the only controversial cause espoused by\nCondorcet: Even before publicly addressing the woman question, he\nargued vociferously for the humanity and rights of enslaved Africans,\nand proposed the abolition of slavery in France\u2019s overseas colonies.\nHis 1781 work R\u00e9flexions sur l\u2019esclavage des\nn\u00e8gres [Reflections on Black Slavery] helped incite the\nabolitionist movement in France, which came together in early 1788 in\nthe newly created Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Amis des Noirs [Society of\nthe Friends of Blacks], of which Condorcet became president in January\n1789: a counter-lobby to the influential pro-planter Club\n Massiac.[5]\n Condorcet published actively throughout the 1780s and later drafted\nnumerous legislative bills for the National Assembly on the question\nof colonial reform and the slave trade. In addition, he advocated for\nfreedom of commerce, the rights of religious minorities, and criminal\nlaw reform. He considered neither sodomy nor suicide as crimes because\nthey \u201cdo not violate the rights of any other man\u201d, unlike\nrape, which \u201cviolates the property which everyone has in her\nperson\u201d (\u201cNotes on Voltaire [1789]\u201d, in Condorcet\nO\u2019Connor and Arago 1968 [orig. 1847\u20139], vol. IV, 561, 563, 577,\ncited in McLean and Hewitt 1994, 56). He believed in the right of a\nwoman to plan her pregnancies. His views on female education were\nespecially progressive for his time, as he proposed that girls be\neducated alongside boys within universal, co-educational institutions;\nand he would have provided for women\u2019s admission to all professions\nfor which they showed talent.\n\nFeminist, abolitionist, and, in his final years, a democratic\nrepublican, Condorcet acted in public life to expand the claims of\njustice, morality, and human rights. Friend, prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and\nally of Jean Le Rond d\u2019Alembert, disciple of Voltaire, collaborator of\nthe Encyclop\u00e9die, perpetual secretary of the Academy\nof Sciences, member of the French Academy and numerous European\nacademies, renowned mathematician and author of biographies of\nAnne-Robert-Jacques Turgot and Voltaire and many other prominent\nintellectuals of his time, he also participated actively in the world\nof political affairs\u2014first under Turgot\u2019s short ministry\n(1774\u20131776), and then again during the French Revolution. Before\nthe Revolution, he published essays on the application of the theory\nof probability to popular voting, on the American Revolution and the\nConstitutional Convention; and he actively polemicized on behalf of\nTurgot\u2019s attempted reforms of economic and political life. He was\nperhaps the only one of the contributors to Diderot and d\u2019Alembert\u2019s\ncelebrated Encyclop\u00e9die to live long enough to\nparticipate in the French Revolution, helping to draft the 1789\nD\u00e9claration des droits de l\u2019homme et du citoyen\n[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]. Tragically, he\nwas also one of the Revolution\u2019s most prominent casualties:\nParticipant in the preparations for the Convocations of the Estates\nGeneral, elected representative to the Legislative Assembly in 1791\nand later to the National Convention, he wrote a report on public\n instruction[6]\n and drafted a constitution for France embodying his ideal voting\nprocedures, which was never adopted. The year 1793 was a fateful one\nfor Condorcet. He came under an order of proscription by the\nConvention in 1793 following his publicly voiced objections to the\nscrapping of his draft constitution in favor of a hastily prepared\nversion supported by the increasingly dominant Jacobin faction of the\nConvention, his protests over press censorship and the arrests of the\nGirondins, and his scathing comparisons of the Jacobins of 1793 to the\nroyalists of 1791. After eight months in hiding, during which time he\nwrote his unfinished Esquisse [Sketch] (which included the\nsection published first in 1804 as Fragment on the New Atlantis,\nor Combined Efforts of the Human Species for the Advancement of\nScience), he fled Paris but was arrested on March 27, 1794, and\nimprisoned in Bourgla-Reine, where he was found dead in his prison\ncell on March 29\u2014the cause of his death remains unknown. In the\nflorid phrasing of one of his nineteenth-century admirers:\n\n\nOf the illustrious thinkers and writers who for two generations had\nbeen actively scattering the seed of revolution in France, only\nCondorcet survived to behold the first bitter in-gathering of the\nharvest. Those who had sown the wind were no more; he only was left to\nsee the reaping of the whirlwind, and to be swiftly and cruelly swept\naway by it. Voltaire and Diderot, Rousseau and Helv\u00e9tius, had\nvanished, but Condorcet both assisted at the Encyclopaedia and sat in\nthe Convention; the one eminent man of those who had tended the tree,\nwho also came in due season to partake of its fruit; at once a\nprecursor, and a sharer in the fulfillment. (Morley 1871, 37)\n\n",
