    "main_text": "A Progressive Alternative: The Higher-Brain Approach || The Appeal to Prudential Value\n2.4 The Appeal to Prudential Value\n\nThe idea here is to defend the higher-brain approach on the basis of\nclaims about prudential value (for a discussion, see DeGrazia 2005,\n134\u20138). Conscious life, it is argued, is a precondition for\nvirtually everything that we value in our lives. We have an enormous\nstake in continuing our lives as persons and little or no stake in\ncontinuing them when we are permanently unconscious. The capacity for\nconsciousness is therefore essential not in a metaphysical\nsense connected to our persistence conditions, but in the evaluative\nsense of indispensable to us. One need not claim that the\ncapacity for consciousness underlies everything of prudential value,\njust that it underlies the overwhelmingly greater part of what matters\nto us prudentially. And although, for many people, consciousness may\nnot be sufficient for what matters prudentially\u2014insofar\nas they find indispensable, say, some degree of self-awareness and\nmeaningful interaction with others\u2014it is certainly necessary;\nand the basic capacity for consciousness (as opposed to\nself-consciousness or personhood) is the only safe place to demarcate\ndeath for policy and social purposes. We should therefore regard\nirreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness as a human being's\ndeath\u2014even if the original concept of death is biological and\nbiological considerations favor some less progressive standard.\n\nHow persuasive is this case for the higher-brain approach? One might\nchallenge the assumption that prudential, as opposed to moral,\nconsiderations ought to be decisive in adopting a standard for human\ndeath. On the other hand, as suggested in our discussion of the\nprevious argumentative strategy, moral considerations may not favor a\nparticular standard of death except insofar as they rest on prudential\nconsiderations\u2014our present concern. But even if we accept the\nclaim that human death should be understood on the basis of prudential\nvalues, we confront the prospect of reasonable pluralism about\nprudential value. While supporters of the higher-brain approach (who\ntend to be liberal intellectuals) are likely to have prudential values\nin line with this approach, many other people do not. If a patient has\na stake in his family's need for closure should he enter a\nPVS\u2014an interest that may be self-regarding as well as\nother-regarding\u2014this fact would count against allowing the PVS\nto constitute death in his case. If an Orthodox Jew or conservative\nChristian believes that (biological) life is inherently precious to\nits possessor, even if the individual cannot appreciate its value at a\ngiven time, this would count against the higher-brain standard in the\ncase of the individual in question. Perhaps, then, the appeal to\nprudential value favors not the higher-brain standard for everyone but\na pro-choice view about standards of death. A jurisdiction\nmight, for example, have one default standard of death but permit\nconscientious exemption from that standard and selection of a\ndifferent one within some reasonable range of options (Veatch 2019).\n\nIn reply to this argument, a proponent of the appeal to prudential\nvalue might contend that it is simply irrational to value biological\nexistence without the possibility of returning to consciousness. But\nthis reply assumes the experience requirement: that only\nstates of affairs that affect one's experience can affect one's\nwell-being (for a discussion, see Griffin 1986, 16\u201319). The\nexperience requirement is not self-evident. Some people believe that\nthey are worse off for being slandered even if they never learn of the\nslander and its repercussions never affect their experience. Some even\nbelieve, following Aristotle's suggestion, that the quality of one's\nlife as a whole can be affected by posthumous states of affairs such\nas tragedy befalling a loved one. Although the intelligibility of this\nbelief in posthumous interests might be challenged, the following is\nsurely intelligible: States of affairs that don't affect one's\nexperience but connect importantly with one's values can affect one's\ninterests at least while one exists. Desire-based accounts of\nwell-being (see, e.g., Hare 1981) standardly accept this principle,\nfor what is desired may occur without one's awareness of its\noccurrence and without affecting one's experience. These\nconsiderations illuminate the intelligibility of one's prudential\nvalues extending to a period of time when one is alive but\nirreversibly unconscious.\n\nIn view of apparently reasonable pluralism regarding prudential\nvalues, including reasonable disagreement about the experience\nrequirement, it seems doubtful that appeal to prudential value alone\ncan support the higher-brain standard for everyone. At the same time,\nand more generally, the higher-brain approach remains an important\ncontender in the debate over the definition of death.\n3. A Proposed Return to Tradition: An Updated Cardiopulmonary Approach\n\nPrior to the brain-death movement, death was traditionally understood\nalong the lines of the cardiopulmonary standard: death as the\nirreversible cessation of cardiopulmonary function. In the\nsupportive background of this consensus on the cardiopulmonary\nstandard hovered several general definitions or conceptualizations of\ndeath. Some champions of the traditional standard (e.g., Becker 1975)\nhave conceptualized death in the same organismic terms that proponents\nof the whole-brain standard invoke: death as the irreversible\ncessation of functioning of the organism as a whole. Other champions\nof tradition have conceptualized death in more spiritual terms such as\nthe departure of the animating (or vital) principle or\nloss of the soul.\n\nIn determining whether someone was dead, one could check for a pulse,\nmoisture on a mirror held in front of the mouth, or other indications\nthat the heart and lungs were working. Before the development of\nrespirators and other modern life-supports, a working heart and lungs\nindicated continuing brainstem function. As we have seen, however,\nmodern life-supports permitted cardiopulmonary function without brain\nfunction, setting up a competition between traditional and whole-brain\ncriteria for determining death. Although, as noted above, the\nwhole-brain approach achieved near-consensus status, this approach is\nincreasingly questioned and faces significant difficulties. Its\ndifficulties and those facing the more radical higher-brain\nalternative have contributed to renewed interest in the traditional\napproach.\n\nFurther contributing to renewed interest in the traditional\napproach\u2014and warranting a brief digression\u2014is an approach\nto organ donation that capitalizes on the fact that current American\nlegal standards for death are disjunctive, permitting satisfaction of\neither the whole-brain standard or the cardiopulmonary standard,\nwhichever applies first, for a declaration of death. This approach to\norgan donation, called donation after cardiac death (DCD) or\nnon-heart-beating organ donation, was very rare until\ninstituted with much publicity by the University of Pittsburgh in the\nearly 1990s in response to a perception that awaiting a neurological\ndetermination of death for (heart-beating, respirator-maintained)\norgan donors was insufficient to meet the demand for viable organs. In\nthe Pittsburgh program, a respirator-dependent patient who had\npreviously agreed to forgo life supports and donate vital organs is\ntaken to an operating room and disconnected from the respirator,\nleading predictably to cardiac arrest. Two minutes after cardiac\narrest, the patient is declared dead on the basis of the\ncardiopulmonary standard: \u201cirreversible cessation of circulatory\nand respiratory functions.\u201d This procedure allows organ\nprocurement to commence very shortly after cardiac arrest, providing\nrelatively fresh organs for transplant. (Organs, of course, would not\nbe viable if medical staff awaited a declaration of total brain\nfailure\u2014which requires confirmatory tests hours after initial\ntests\u2014in the patients in question, who will not incur total\nbrain failure unless respirator support is discontinued.)\n\nThe practice of DCD, which has expanded to several medical centers,\nhas provoked considerable controversy. Critics have charged that in\nDCD vital organs are removed before patients are really dead, implying\nthat organ procurement kills the patients. Some proponents of the\nwhole-brain approach argue that the patients are not yet dead because\nonly total brain failure (or perhaps that of the brainstem)\nconstitutes human death. But current American law in its disjunctive form\nsuggests otherwise\u2014at least for legal purposes. Other critics of\nDCD charge that a patient cannot be dead two minutes after cardiac\narrest because the loss of cardiopulmonary functioning is not\nirreversible: Victims of heart attack are sometimes revived more than\ntwo minutes after the arrest. One might reply that the loss of\nfunctioning is irreversible because, the patient having requested\nremoval of life supports, no one may violate the patient's\nrights by resuscitating him or her (Tomlinson 1993). It seems fair to\nreply, however, that a decision not to resuscitate does not mean that\nresuscitation is impossible as suggested by the concept of\nirreversibility. Has the latter concept been conflated in DCD\nwith the concept of permanence? Permanent loss of function\ndoes not imply that resuscitation is impossible, just that it will not\n occur.[3]\n These concerns about abandoning the standard of irreversible loss of\ncardiopulmonary function apply even to more modest proposals, such as\nthat advanced by the Institute of Medicine (2000), in which a\ndeclaration of death and DCD proceed after a waiting period of\nfive minutes: Resuscitation is sometimes possible more than\nfive minutes after a heart attack. Proponents of DCD might reply that\npermanence, rather than irreversibility, is the appropriate standard\nin this context (see, e.g., Bernat 2006, 41) or that DCD represents an\ninstance where it is permissible to remove vital organs from someone\nwho is dying but not yet dead. Certainly, any proponent of DCD will\nsee the current law's (disjunctive) acceptance of cardiopulmonary\ncriteria for death as offering a major practical advantage over any\npolicy that accepted only whole-brain criteria.\n\nWe return to the view of those who champion only the\ncardiopulmonary standard. Proponents of this approach believe that it\ncorrectly implies, contrary to competing standards, that a human body\nthat is breathing and maintaining circulation is alive regardless of\nwhether continuation of these functions requires external support (as\nwith \u201cbrain-dead\u201d patients, locked-in patients, and normal\nfetuses) (Shewmon 2001; Potts 2001). At the same time, the usual\ncharacterization of the traditional approach is problematic in\nsuggesting that the difference between human life and death comes down\nto the state of two organs: heart and lungs. This reductionistic\npicture arguably obscures the holistic nature of bodily\nfunctioning.\n\nA more realistic picture, some argue, features integrative unity as\nexisting diffusely throughout the organism. As a leading proponent\nputs it, \u201cWhat is of the essence of integrative unity is neither\nlocalized nor replaceable: namely the anti-entropic mutual interaction\nof all the cells and tissues of the body, mediated in mammals by\ncirculating oxygenated blood\u201d (Shewmon 2001, 473). On this view,\nthe brain, like the heart and lungs, is a very important component of\nthe interaction among body systems, but is not the supremely important\nintegrator as suggested by the (mainstream) whole-brain approach. Nor\nis the functioning of other organs and bodily systems passively\ndependent on the brain. The brain's capacity to augment other systems\npresupposes their preexisting capacity to function. This is true even\nof a brain function as somatically integrating as the maintenance of\nbody temperature: the \u201cthermostat\u201d may be in the brain,\nbut the \u201cfurnace\u201d is the energy metabolism diffused\nthroughout the body. If not covered with blankets, brain-dead bodies\nmaintained on respirators will grow colder\u2014but not comparably to\ncorpses (ibid, 471).\n\nAlthough a realistic picture of organismic functioning must be\nholistic, according to this updated traditional approach, it should\nalso portray certain functions as central. Tradition is correct that\nrespiration and circulation are especially crucial, but respiration is\nnot simply lung function and circulation is not just a working heart.\nBoth organs, after all, can be artificially replaced as the organism\nmaintains integrated functioning. Respiration and circulation occur\nthroughout the body as oxygenated blood circulates to different organs\nand bodily systems\u2014a condition necessary and sufficient for the\nintegrated organismic functioning that constitutes life. Unlike\nwhole-brain and higher-brain death, loss of respiration and\ncirculation leads relentlessly to the breakdown of cells, tissues,\norgans, bodily systems, and eventually the organism as a whole. Hence\nan updated traditional standard, which we might call the\ncirculatory-respiratory standard: death as the\nirreversible cessation of circulatory-respiratory\nfunction.\n\nThe chief advantage of such an updated traditional approach, according\nto proponents, is that it most adequately characterizes the difference\nbetween life and death\u2014where the latter is understood in terms\nof organismic functioning\u2014in a full range of cases. Such cases\ninclude several that the whole-brain and higher-brain standards handle\nless plausibly such as prenatal human organisms prior to brain\ndevelopment as well as locked-in patients and \u201cbrain-dead\u201d\nindividuals whose vital functions are maintained with mechanical\nassistance. The present approach also avoids some of the conceptual\nproblems facing the higher-brain approach, as discussed earlier.\n\nNevertheless, the traditional approach, whether updated or not, faces\nsignificant issues. One concern is that the approach overemphasizes\nour biological nature, suggesting we are nothing more than organisms,\nand by demoting the brain from prominence underemphasizes the mental\nlife that is generally thought to distinguish our species from others.\nWe human beings are not merely organisms or animals, the argument\ncontinues; we are also (after normal development) conscious beings and\npersons whose nature, one might say, is to transcend nature with\nculture. Our conception of human death should be faithful to a species\nself-image that does justice not only to our animality but also to our\npersonhood (cf. Pallis 1999, 96).\n\nWhole-brain (or brainstem) theorists and higher-brain theorists will\nextend this line of argument in different directions. The higher-brain\ntheorist will suggest that our capacity for consciousness, a\nprecondition for higher capacities and personhood, is so important\nthat permanent loss of the basic capacity should count as death. The\nwhole-brain theorist who develops the present line of reasoning will\nmaintain greater contact with the organismic conception of death,\nstressing the brainstem's role in integrating vital functions and\nclaiming either that (a) consciousness is a critical function of the\norganism, permitting it to interact adaptively to its environment\n(Bernat 1998), (b) consciousness is a characteristic aspect of the\nfundamental work of organisms like us, or (c) consciousness is crucial\nto our personhood, a feature no less important to what we are than our\nanimality. The latter option, in effect, would move the whole-brain\ntheorist to a dual-aspect understanding of human nature, as just\ndiscussed: human persons as essentially both persons\nand animals (cf. Schechtman 2014).\n\nA second major challenge confronting any traditional approach is the\nspecter of highly unpalatable practical consequences (Magnus, Wilfond, and Caplan 2014). Currently the\nwhole-brain standard is enshrined in law. Suppose we reversed\nlegislative course and returned to traditional criteria (whether\nupdated in formulation or not). Then a patient who satisfied\nwhole-brain criteria but not traditional criteria would count as alive. Unless we overturned the\n\u201cdead-donor rule\u201d\u2014the policy of permitting\nextraction of vital organs only from dead bodies\u2014then it would\nbe illegal to procure organs from these living patients who have\nincurred total brain failure; yet the viability of their organs would\nrequire maintaining respiration and circulation with life-supports.\nThere is broad agreement that having to wait until traditional\ncriteria are met to harvest organs would constitute a great setback to\norgan transplantation (even if donation after cardiac death, which\ninvokes traditional criteria, is permitted). Moreover, a legal return\nto traditional criteria for death might lead physicians to feel they\nhad lost the authority to discontinue treatment\nunilaterally\u2014when a family requests continued\ntreatment\u2014upon a determination of total brain failure despite\nwhat many would consider the futility of further treatment.\nFurthermore, laws for determining death would have to be revised.\n\nA defender of tradition might respond that we can avoid most of these\nunsavory consequences while legally adopting traditional criteria for\ndetermining death (see, e.g., DeGrazia 2005, 152\u20138). We could,\nfor one thing, abandon the dead-donor rule, permitting the harvesting\nof vital organs when authorized by appropriate prospective consent of\nthe donor even though taking the organs, by causing the donor's death,\nwould instantiate killing (Truog and Robinson 2003; Sade 2011). We\ncould also authorize physicians\u2014through hospital policies,\nprofessional guidelines, or laws\u2014to withdraw\nlife-supports unilaterally upon a declaration of total brain failure (perhaps even\nupon a determination of irreversible unconsciousness) in cases where\ncontinued treatment is unnecessary for organ procurement and appears\notherwise futile. Not all of what are traditionally considered\n\u201cdeath behaviors\u201d need to be permanently anchored to a\ndeclaration of death. Thus we currently use advance directives and\nother considerations to justify withdrawal of life-supports in some\ncircumstances, although several decades ago such withdrawal had to\nawait a determination of death. There is no reason to regard further\nreforms of our practices surrounding death as beyond responsible\nconsideration. Thus, despite rowing against the tide of the\nbrain-death movement, the traditional approach has reclaimed the\nstatus of a serious contender in the debate over the definition of\ndeath.\n4. Further Possibilities\n\nIn recent decades, the debate over the definition of death has\ngenerally been understood as a competition between the approaches\ndiscussed here: traditional, whole-brain (or brainstem), and\nhigher-brain standards and their corresponding conceptualizations.\nEach of these approaches, however, makes certain assumptions that\nmight be contested: (1) that death is more or less determinate, more\nevent-like than process-like, (2) that there is a uniquely correct\ndefinition of death, which can be formulated in terms of necessary and\njointly sufficient conditions, and (3) that human death is morally a\nvery important marker. Now we will consider three nonstandard ways of\nthinking about death, each of which directly challenges one of these\nassumptions.\n4.1 Death as a Process, Not a Determinate Event\n\nEach of the approaches considered so far asserts the correctness of a\nsingle standard of death. Might different standards be appropriate for\ndifferent purposes? If so, then the debate characterized in previous\nsections has reflected, to some extent, an exercise in futility: a\nsearch that wrongly seeks a determinate event, which can be captured\nby a single standard, rather than a process.\n\nAccording to two authors who develop this line of reasoning, the\nnearly simultaneous emergence of organ transplantation and mechanical\nventilators provoked three practical questions: (1) When may doctors\ntake organs for transplantation? (2) When may doctors unilaterally\ndiscontinue treatment? (3) When is a patient dead for legal purposes\nand appropriately transferred to an undertaker? (Halevy and Brody\n1993). Rather than assuming that one standard for death will\nadequately answer these three questions\u2014a possibility rendered\ndoubtful by the interminable debate over standards\u2014we should\nanswer each question on its merits, disaggregating death\naccordingly.\n\nProviding one example of how these practical questions might be\nanswered, the authors argue that organ procurement is appropriate when\nthe whole-brain standard has been met (apparently precluding DCD),\nunilateral discontinuation of treatment is appropriate when the\nhigher-brain standard has been met, and a patient should legally count\nas dead when traditional criteria have been met (ibid). (Here we need\nnot consider the authors' specific arguments for these\ndeterminations.)\n\nBut why must each answer invoke a standard of death? An alternative\nwould be to adopt an updated traditional standard, which would supply\nlegal criteria for death, while denying that unilateral\ndiscontinuation of treatment and organ procurement must await death.\nTo be sure, harvesting vital organs from living patients would require\nan exception to the dead-donor rule, the social risks of which might\nwell be avoided if death were disaggregated along the lines suggested.\nBut the alternative possibility of separating death from particular\n\u201cdeath behaviors\u201d motivates the question of whether there\nare further grounds for disaggregating death into a process.\n\nA possible further ground is the thesis that life and death, although\nmutually exclusive states, are not exhaustive: \u201cAlthough no\norganism can fully belong to both sets [life and death], organisms can\nbe in many conditions (the very conditions that have created the\ndebates about death) during which they do not fully belong to either.\n\u2026 Death is a fuzzy set,\u201d (Brody 1999, 72). What are we to\nthink of this proposal?\n\nIt seems undeniable that the boundary between life and death is not\nperfectly \n sharp.[4] \n The specification of any\nstandard will require some arbitrary line-drawing. Operationalizing\nthe whole-brain standard requires a decision about which brain\nfunctions are too trivial to count and need not be tested for. Making\na traditional standard clinically useful requires a cut-off point of\nsome number of minutes without heartbeat or respiration for the loss\nof functioning to count as irreversible. A higher-brain approach needs\ncriteria for determining what sorts of brain damage constitute\nirreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness and which count as\nreversible. Yet, while some arbitrariness is inevitable, and\nhighlights a blurred boundary, the blurring in each instance concerns\nvery specific criteria and clinical tests for determining that a\nstandard has been met, not the standard itself. None of the blurred\nboundaries just considered is inconsistent with the claim that some\nstandard is uniquely correct. Moreover, if essentialism regarding\nhuman persons is true\u2014that is, if we human persons have an\nessence locating us in our most basic kind (e.g., animal, minded\nbeing)\u2014this would strengthen the case for a uniquely correct\nstandard by suggesting a foundation for one.\n\nBut we must consider the possibility that there is no correct\nstandard. Perhaps death is no more determinate than adulthood. Some\npeople are clearly adults and some people are clearly not adults. But,\nas any college professor knows, many people are ambiguously\nadults\u2014mature enough to count as adults in some ways but not in\nothers. Socially and legally, we treat 16-year-olds as adults for\npurposes of driving, 18-year-olds as adults for purposes of voting and\nbearing the full weight of criminal law, 21-year-olds as adult enough\nto drink alcoholic beverages, and so on. Nor is this disaggregation of\nadulthood incoherent or even particularly awkward; rather, it seems to\nfit the facts about the gradual development of maturity, acquisition\nof experience, and accumulation of birthdays. Disaggregating death,\none might argue, would be similarly faithful to facts about the\nfrequently very gradual demise of human persons.\n\nEven if this argument persuades us that death is more process-like\nthan event-like\u2014and to do this it must persuade us that it is\ndeath itself, not dying, that is process-like\u2014it does\nnot follow that we ought to draw several lines for the determination\nof death. Consider the confusion that would likely result from such\nstatements as \u201cGrandmother is partly dead, but less dead than\nGrandfather, although he's not fully dead.\u201d People are so\naccustomed to thinking of life and death as mutually exclusive,\nexhaustive sets that there would be considerable practical advantage\nin insisting on some sensible line that demarcates death in this way.\nIt is true that disaggregating adulthood poses no insuperable\npractical difficulties, but death is importantly different. For we\ngenerally assume that one goes out of existence (at least in this\nworld) at death, a rather momentous change with\u2014at least in the\nstatus quo\u2014far-reaching social and legal ramifications.\nConfusion as a result of plural lines for death may be more troubling\nand more likely, for the idea of someone's only partly existing is of\nquestionable intelligibility. On the other hand, a proponent of\ndisaggregating death might reply that (1) we could either reserve the\nlanguage of death for the traditional standard or get used to the\nlanguage of someone's being partially dead, and (2) we should\nappreciate that existence is sometimes partial as in the case\nof a half-assembled car.\n4.2 Death as a Cluster Concept not Amenable to Classical Definition\n\nMost discussions of the definition and determination of death assume\nthat there is a uniquely correct definition of death. Definitions,\nclassically understood, are supposed to state necessary and jointly\nsufficient conditions for the correct application of a word or\nconcept. They may be thought to capture de re essences\nexisting independently of human thought, language, and interests, or\nde dicto essences determined solely by linguistic meaning.\nThe major approaches we have considered have tried both to define\ndeath by capturing its essence and to advance a standard for\ndetermining human death that coheres with the definition. But what if\nthe term \u201cdeath\u201d cannot be defined in any such way?\n\nOne might insist that death can be defined, as the competing\ndefinitions demonstrate. But, of course, the trick is to define the\nterm adequately. For example, the organismic definition\u2014death as\nthe irreversible cessation of functioning of the organism as a\nwhole\u2014makes no reference to consciousness. Yet surely, one might\nargue, any organism that maintains consciousness should count as alive\neven if the organism as a whole has irreversibly ceased to function\n(whether or not this possibility is merely theoretical). Definitions\nassociated with the higher-brain approach\u2014such as human death as\nthe irreversible loss of mind\u2014implausibly imply that a PVS\npatient is dead despite exhibiting spontaneous breathing and\ncirculation, brainstem-mediated reflexes, and the like. The best\nexplanation for the shortcomings of leading efforts to define death,\nthe argument continues, is that death is not amenable to definition in\nterms of necessary and sufficient conditions (Chiong 2005). Let's\nconsider two distinct ways this thesis might be developed.\n\nFirst, one might argue that the concept of death exhibits only\n\u201cfamily resemblance\u201d relations among its instances, as\nWittgenstein argued was the case for the concepts of game,\nlanguage, and many others (Wittgenstein 1953). There are\nvarious features of an organism that count towards its being dead, yet\nthere is no authoritative list of features all of which must be\nsatisfied for it to be dead. Each of the following, for example, seems\nrelevant: unconsciousness, absence of spontaneous efforts to breathe,\nabsence of heartbeat, inertness, lack of integrated bodily functions,\nincapacity to grow, and physical decay. If all of these conditions are\npresent, an organism has surely died. But producing an authoritative\nshortlist of necessary and sufficient conditions seems futile. One\nscholar has advanced a parallel claim about the concept of life:\n\nWhen some property is central to the cluster\u2014as I've argued\nconsciousness is\u2014then possessing only this one property may be\nsufficient for membership in [the class of living things]. However,\nmerely possessing one or several properties that are peripheral to the\ncluster may not be sufficient for membership. [S]ome robots are\norganizationally complex and functionally responsive, though\nintuitively not alive (Chiong 2005, 26).\n\n\nAnother direction in which to take the thesis that death is not\namenable to classical definition is to argue that death is a natural\nkind whose essence may be obscure. Kripke influentially argued that\nnatural kinds\u2014kinds determined by nature rather than by human\nthinking, language, or interests\u2014often resist adequate\ndefinition because their essential features may be entirely unknown to\nthose referring to the kind in question (Kripke 1970). To define a\nterm by reference to the features people originally used to pick out\nthe kind in question won't do, because those features may be\naccidental, not essential, and speakers may even be mistaken about\nthem. Those naming the kind whale might have thought whales\nwere the largest fish in the ocean, but whales are not fish and their\nsize relative to other creatures is a contingent matter. We can refer\nmeaningfully to whales, to the creatures picked out by the term\nwhale (the name for the kind), without knowing the essential\nfeatures of whales, features likely to involve subtle biological\ndetails. Perhaps death, too, is a natural kind whose essence is\nobscure (a possibility entertained in Chiong 2005, 24\u201325). A\nlikely challenge to this argument is that we already know a great deal\nabout the physical processes involved in death, making it unlikely\nthat death has a hidden essence the failure to discover which impedes\nadequate definition.\n\nImportantly, though, one can claim that death is a natural kind\nwithout accepting any kind of essentialism. An alternative to the\nessentialist conception is the homeostatic property cluster theory of\nnatural kinds (Millikan 1999). On this view, natural kinds do not, or\nat least need not, share essential properties. They are comprised by\nmembers sharing a stable cluster of similarities, which are brought\nabout by \u201chomeostatic causal mechanisms\u201d (such as, in the\ncase of species, common developmental programs and selective\npressures). On this view, X (e.g., a fetus) might be a member of a\nnatural kind (e.g., our species) despite lacking one of the properties\n(e.g., the potential for rationality) among the cluster of\nsimilarities. Death and its opposite, life, might similarly be natural\nkinds lacking essences, each kind being associated with a cluster of\nproperties that tend to go together and support one another without\nbeing necessarily coinstantiated (see, e.g., Chiong 2005). If\nso, death cannot be defined in a set of necessary and sufficient\nconditions\u2014in which case no such definition can justify a\nparticular standard.\n\nIf death has no essence and resists definition, what is the upshot?\nOne possible inference\u2014that the boundaries of death are\nvague\u2014would partially merge this approach with the previous one,\nwhich construed death as a process. We have noted that one response to\nthe claim of vague boundaries (the response favored in the previous\napproach) is to embrace several lines, each for a different purpose,\nin determining death. Another possibility is to understand the vague\nboundaries as inviting discretion in the matter of producing a single\nstandard of death. So long as a particular standard does not have\nclear and highly implausible implications, it is admissible for\nconsideration on this view. Society may then select, among admissible\nstandards, whichever is most attractive for practical purposes. It has\nbeen argued, along these lines, that the higher-brain standard is\ninadmissible for implying that those in PVS are dead while the\ntraditional cardiopulmonary standard is inadmissible for implying (in\nprinciple) that a still-conscious individual might be dead, clearing\nthe ground for the whole-brain standard, which has no fatal\nimplications and is attractive from a practical standpoint (Chiong\n2005).\n\nHaving already explored difficulties (and strengths) of each standard,\nhow might we evaluate the more general thesis that death is not\namenable to classical definition? One strategy open to critics of this\nreasoning, of course, is to argue that some definition is adequate.\nAnother is to defend the disaggregation of death, as previously\ndiscussed. A third strategy would be to argue that our failure thus\nfar to produce an adequate definition does not mean that none is\npossible. Some concepts can be adequately captured by classical\ndefinitions even if it is difficult to produce them. It would appear\npremature, therefore, to render a judgment on the success of the\npresent approach to understanding human death.\n4.3 Death as Separable from Moral Concerns\n\nA final assumption underlying the mainstream discussion of the\ndefinition of death is that human death is a morally crucial marker.\nWere it not, then accuracy in the definition of death would be of\npurely ontological, conceptual, or scientific interest. This attitude,\nof course, is not the prevailing one. Not only do we tend to regard\nmany behaviors as appropriate only if an individual has died; the\ncriminal law treats as momentous the question of whether one person\nhas killed\u2014that is, caused the death of\u2014another person,\neven if such considerations as motive, deliberation, and special\ncircumstances are also important.\n\nIt is not difficult to see, though, how one might challenge this\npresumption of death's moral salience. After all, we have already\nbegun to remove certain behaviors from the class of death behaviors.\nFor example, in many circumstances termination of life supports need\nnot await a patient's death. And, as we have noted, there are calls to\nabandon the dead-donor rule in the context of organ transplantation.\nWe might go further in separating death from the cluster of moral\nconcerns traditionally associated with it. For example, without\nembracing the higher-brain approach to death, we could hold that\nirreversible loss of the capacity of consciousness entails a loss of\nmoral status, at which point traditional death behaviors are\nappropriate (Persson 2002). We might even overhaul the criminal law\nwith respect to killing:\n\nIt is then the irrevocable loss of the capacity for consciousness that\nis the great loss; so it is for the causing of it that criminal law\nshould mete out the severest punishment. Killing, or the causing of\n(biological) death, should be punished to this degree only if, as is\nnormally the case, it brings along the irrevocable loss of the\ncapacity for consciousness (ibid, 32).\n\n\nOne implication of this proposal is that harvesting organs from PVS\npatients, thereby killing them, would not be punishable insofar as\nthese patients, having irrevocably lost the capacity for\nconsciousness, have already suffered \u201cthe great loss\u201d and\nno longer possess moral status. Some attracted to this approach will\nwant to argue further that the crime of murder is really that of\ncausing the irrevocable loss of the capacity for consciousness\nwithout first obtaining voluntary, informed consent from the\nperson to be killed. The\nitalicized qualification would create conceptual space for a\njustification of active euthanasia (see the entry on\n voluntary euthanasia).\n\nThe present proposal to separate the issue of death from what is\nmorally important is somewhat radical. Yet its chief ground for doing\nso, the claim that the capacity for consciousness is what underlies\nmoral status, cannot be dismissed. On the other hand, this claim\napparently relies on the thesis (which we considered in connection\nwith the higher-brain approach) that only what affects one's\nexperience can affect one's interests. As we saw, this thesis is far\nfrom self-evident. For those who disagree with it, the time of\ndeath\u2014the time at which one no longer exists (at least in this\nworld)\u2014is likely to retain some of the moral importance\ntraditionally accorded to it. Moreover, even if the philosophical case\nfor demoting the moral importance of death were airtight, we cannot\nresponsibly dismiss widely held sensibilities, including those at odds\nwith the present approach, in constructing public policies concerning\ndeath. Certainly it is contestable to what extent the public could\nembrace further demotion of the moral importance of death, and to what\nextent its limited ability to do so matters for public policy.",
