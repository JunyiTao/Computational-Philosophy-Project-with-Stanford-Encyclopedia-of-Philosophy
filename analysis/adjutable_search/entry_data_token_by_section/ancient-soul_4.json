    "main_text": "Plato's Theories of Soul || The Republic's Theory of Soul\n3.2 The Republic's Theory of Soul\n\n The Phaedo was also known to ancient readers as Plato's On\nthe Soul, whereas the Republic has On Justice as an\nalternative ancient title. Plato, however, conceives of justice as the\nexcellent state of the soul, and so it is not surprising that the\nRepublic sheds a great deal of light on Plato's conception of\nthe soul. One way in which it does so is by explicitly integrating a\nnumber of central features of the ordinary notion of soul, features\nwhich, in the Phaedo, coexist somewhat uneasily: namely,\nresponsibility for the life of an organism (that is, in the human\ncase, responsibility for its being and remaining alive as a human\nbeing), for cognitive and (especially) intellectual functions, and for\nmoral virtues such as courage and justice.  Towards the end of\nRepublic 1, Socrates offers Thrasymachus an elaborate argument\nto the conclusion that \u201cinjustice is never more profitable than\njustice\u201d (354a). If we set aside, as irrelevant to the\ndialectical context, the possibility that injustice and justice are\nequally profitable, it is clear that the conclusion here is\nequivalent to the position that the Republic is designed to\nestablish, in response to Glaucon's request, at the beginning of Book\n2, to be convinced by Socrates \u201cthat it is better in every way\nto be just than to be unjust\u201d (357a). The argument at the end of\nBook 1 proceeds by attempting to prove an interim conclusion that is\nunnecessarily strong, namely that the just person is happy, whereas\nthe unjust person is wretched. To establish the desired conclusion, it\nis enough to prove that the just person is always happier than\nthe unjust person, which, unlike the unnecessarily strong interim\nconclusion, is compatible with the view that justice is not sufficient\nfor (fully completed) happiness, since that requires suitable external\ncircumstances in addition to justice. Nothing in Socrates' long answer\nto Glaucon (and Adeimantus) commits him to the view that justice is\nsufficient for (complete) happiness (cf. Irwin 1999). However, that\nview is not implied by the conception of the soul that Socrates relies\non in this (Book 1) argument.  Moreover, nothing in the\nRepublic contradicts or modifies this conception of the soul\n(on the contrary: cf.  445a9f., 609b f.), and so there is no reason\nnot to take it seriously as a contribution to Plato's on-going\nreflection on the soul, even though the argument that surrounds it is\ndesigned to support a conclusion that Socrates subsequently succeeds\nin avoiding. \n\n The argument begins with the premise that things perform their\nfunction well if they have the virtue appropriate to them, and badly\nif they have the relevant vice (353c). It then attributes to the soul\nthe function of \u201ccaring for things, ruling and deliberating (and\nall the things of this kind)\u201d, and adds that living is\nalso part of the function of soul (353d). This yields an interim\nconclusion, that a good soul cares, rules, deliberates (etc.) and\nlives well, whereas a bad soul does these things badly. A third\npremise is that justice is the virtue appropriate to the soul,\ninjustice being its vice. Hence another interim conclusion: a just\nsoul lives well; an unjust one, badly. But living well, says the next\npremise, is being happy (and living badly is being wretched). And so\nSocrates can draw the interim conclusion that we have encountered\nalready, which is that the just person (the person, that is, whose\nsoul is just) is happy, whereas the person whose soul is unjust is\nwretched.\n\n We make nonsense of the argument if we suppose (with Robinson 1995,\n36) that when Socrates introduces living as part of the\nfunction of soul, he has being alive in mind. The idea of being\ngood (or bad) at being alive is, obviously, very odd, as is the idea\nof being alive well or badly. But there is no need to suppose that\nsuch ideas are involved here, or that Socrates passes from one sense\nof \u2018living\u2019 [to z\u00ean] to another. It is, after\nall, open to us to interpret what Socrates is saying in terms of a\nconception that integrates the things that Socrates attributes to the\nsoul as functions, or as parts or aspects of its function, namely in\nterms of the conception of living a life, and not just any kind of\nlife, but a distinctively human one. Caring for the right sorts of\nthings in the right way, ruling or regulating oneself and (when\nappropriate) others, and deliberating about how to act are not just\nnecessary, but central aspects of living a human life, and all of\nthese things can be done well or badly. Depending on the condition of\ntheir soul, a person can be better or worse at doing these things. The\njust person, whose soul is in the best condition, is truly excellent\nat living a human life, in that they are excellent at doing the\nvarious things that are importantly involved in leading a\ndistinctively human life. If this is along the right lines, we might\nbe in a position to see Plato's answer to the question how it can be\nthat one thing, the soul, accounts for the life of an organism as well\nas for its cognitive and intellectual functions, and is also the\nbearer of virtues or excellences. The answer suggested by the Book 1\nargument is this. The way in which the human soul accounts for the\nlife of a human organism is by accounting for the distinctively human\nlife that the individual in question leads. But to account for such a\nlife, it must also account for the cognitive and intellectual\nfunctions which guide and shape such a life. Moreover, the dramatic\ndifferences in how good people are at leading lives, and relatedly the\ndramatic differences in how well they exercise their cognitive and\nintellectual functions, are due to differences in the conditions of\ntheir souls, namely the presence or absence of the virtues of justice,\nwisdom, courage and temperance. This answer significantly clarifies\n(the relevant aspects of) the ordinary Greek notion of soul (see\nsection 1).\nThe Republic also puts forward a new theory of soul, which\ninvolves the claim that the embodied human soul has (at least) three\nparts or aspects, namely reason, spirit and appetite. The argument for\nthis claim is presented in Book 4, and proceeds in roughly the\nfollowing way. Socrates begins by enunciating a principle to the\neffect that opposite actions, affections and states cannot be assigned\nto one thing in respect of the same part of it, in relation to the\nsame object and at the same time. It is then agreed that desiring and\nbeing averse are opposites, and hence that desiring to do something\nand being averse to doing that same thing are opposites in relation to\nthe same object. But it does frequently happen, Socrates points out\nand Glaucon agrees, that the soul desires to do something and at the\nsame time is averse to doing that same thing. This happens, for\ninstance, when a person is thirsty and on that basis wants to drink,\nbut at the same time wishes not to drink, on the basis of some\ncalculation or deliberation, and in fact succeeds in refraining from\ndrinking, thirsty though they are. It follows from the premises stated\nthat the human soul includes at least two distinct subjects, so that\none opposite (the desire to drink) can be assigned to one of them and\nthe other (the aversion to drinking) can be assigned to the\nother. Taking himself to have identified reason and appetite as\ndistinct parts of the soul, Socrates draws attention to other kinds of\nconflict between desires, which are meant to bring to light spirit,\nthe third part of the soul. \n\n The Republic contains a great deal of information that we can\nrely on in characterizing the three parts of the soul that Socrates\nintroduces, information that can be found not only in Book 4 itself,\nbut also (among other places) in the catalogue of corrupt forms of\ncity and soul in Books 8 and 9.  Here is an outline of what\nemerges. Reason is the part of the soul that is, of its own nature,\nattached to knowledge and truth. It is also, however, concerned to\nguide and regulate the life that it is, or anyhow should be, in charge\nof, ideally in a way that is informed by wisdom and that takes into\nconsideration the concerns both of each of the three parts separately\nand of the soul as a whole (442c); these concerns must be supposed to\ninclude a person's bodily needs, presumably via the concerns of\nappetite. The natural attachment of spirit is to honor and, more\ngenerally, to recognition and esteem by others (581a). As a motivating\nforce it generally accounts for self-assertion and ambition. When its\ndesires are frustrated, it gives rise to emotional responses such as\nanger and indignation, and to behavior that expresses and naturally\nflows from such responses.  Socrates takes spirit to be a natural ally\nof reason, at least part of its function being to support reason in\nsuch conflicts as may arise between it and appetite (440ef, 442ab). To\nassign it this function is neither to say nor to imply that spirit\ncannot, in the case of a corrupt and de-natured soul, turn against\nreason, even if well brought-up individuals like Glaucon are not\nfamiliar with such corruption either in their own case or in the case\nof others (440b). (Pace Robinson 1995, 45, who thinks Socrates\nis contradicting himself here.) Appetite is primarily concerned with\nfood, drink and sex (439d, 580e). It gives rise to desires for these\nand other such things which in each case are based, simply and\nimmediately, on the thought that obtaining the relevant object of\ndesire is, or would be, pleasant. Socrates also calls appetite the\nmoney-loving part, because, in the case of mature human beings at\nleast, appetite also tends to be strongly attached to money, given\nthat it is most of all by means of money that its primary desires are\nfulfilled (580e-581a). The idea must be that given suitable\nhabituation and acculturation in the context of a life lived in human\nsociety, appetite tends to become attached to money in such a way that\nit begins to give rise to desires for money which in each case are\nbased, simply and immediately, on the thought that obtaining money is,\nor would be, pleasant; and this idea is natural and plausible\nenough. (Irwin 1995 & Price 1995, 57-67, offer an alternative and\nincompatible interpretation.)\n\n Viewed from the perspective of the theory of soul presented in the\nPhaedo, the Republic theory involves not so much a\ndivision of soul as an integration into soul of mental or\npsychological functions that had been assigned, somewhat\nproblematically, to the body. In both dialogues, Socrates appeals to\nthe same Odyssey passage (Od. 20.17-18 at Phaedo\n94d, Od.  20.17 at Republic 4, 441b), in which Odysseus\nprevails over his own anger: in the Phaedo, to exemplify a\nconflict between soul and body; in the Republic, to exemplify a\nconflict between two parts or aspects of the soul, reason and spirit.\nWhat the Republic offers is a theory of soul which, among other\nthings, allows attribution of (in principle) all mental or\npsychological functions to a single subject, the soul. The theory thus\nrespects the unity of the mind, in a way that the Phaedo theory\ndoes not. Moreover, the Republic theory also offers an\nattractive and well-supported articulation of desire into different\nkinds, which has profound implications both for what it is to have\none's soul (or mind) in optimal condition and for how it is that this\ncondition is best brought about. (To see that Plato is acutely aware\nof these implications, one only needs to look at what the\nRepublic has to say about virtue and education.)  However, it\nmay be worth insisting once more that we should not disregard the fact\nthat the conception of the soul that features in the Republic\nis broader than our concept of mind, in that it continues to be part\nof this conception that it is soul that accounts for the life of the\nrelevant ensouled organism. But if it is soul that accounts for the\nlife of, say, human organisms, there must be some sense in which the\nhuman soul accounts not only for mental functions like thought and\ndesire, but also for other vital functions such as the activities and\noperations of the nutritive and reproductive systems. To the extent\nthat it leaves unclear how exactly it is that the soul is related to a\nbroad range of activities (etc.) that are crucially involved in the\nlives of ensouled organisms, Plato's theory of the soul, in the\nRepublic and beyond, remains incompletely developed. It is, of\ncourse, not surprising that the Republic does not confront the\nquestion how it is that the soul is related to life-functions that, as\nAristotle recognizes (Nicomachean Ethics 1.13, 1102b11-2), are\nirrelevant to the ethical and political concerns of the\nRepublic. However, context and subject matter impose no such\nconstraints on the \u2018plausible myth\u2019 of the Timaeus,\nand also that dialogue, in presenting a somewhat revised version of\nthe Republic's account (Tim. 69c ff.), fails to address\nthe question how the soul is related to non-mental vital\nfunctions.\n",
