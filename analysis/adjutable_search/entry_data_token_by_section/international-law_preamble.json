    "main_text": "\n\nThe English phrase \u201cinternational law\u201d was first coined by\nthe utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham (Janis 1984). But\nphilosophical engagement with international legal themes stretches\nback to writings on natural law in ancient Greece and Rome.\nPhilosophers in this tradition\u2014such as Plato, Aristotle, Cicero,\nand the Stoics\u2014advanced the idea of a universal normative order\nover and above the laws and customs found in particular societies that\nis discoverable through the exercise of ordinary human, or\n\u201cnatural\u201d, reason (Nussbaum 2019: 18\u201396). In the\nMiddle Ages, Christian beliefs framed the idea of normative\nuniversalism which, at times, was cynically deployed to justify the\nwrongs of Christian rulers but, at its best, provided the basis for\nsubjecting their conduct to moral censure, as the criticisms of the\nConquistadores in some of the Spanish Scholastics illustrate\n(Pagden 2003; Pagden & Lawrence 1991).\n\nIn the modern era, the Dutch natural lawyer Hugo Grotius is credited\nwith laying the foundations for the rise of international law as a\ngenuine system of positive law, rather than simply a source of\nuniversal moral or \u201cnatural law\u201d principles. By insisting\nthat his system of law would be justifiable even if it were assumed\nthat God does not exist, i.e., the \u201cetiamsi\ndaremus\u201d argument in the Prolegomena to his De Jure\nBelli ac Pacis (1625: para. XI), Grotius paved the way for a more\ngenuinely universalist conception of international law, independent of\nChristian beliefs and thus more ideologically inclusive (Nussbaum\n2019: 97\u2013140). Subsequently, important contributions were made\nby other major philosophers, including Pufendorf, Kant, Hegel,\nBentham. Although the two leading legal philosophers of the twentieth\ncentury\u2014Hans Kelsen and H.L.A. Hart\u2014devoted attention to\ninternational law, and extensively so in the case of the former\n(Bernstorff 2010), international law was neglected by the Anglophone\nlegal and political philosophers who followed them, and important\nworks by international law scholars with potential significance to\nphilosophical debate\u2014e.g., Brierly (1928) or Lauterpacht\n(1933)\u2014seldom resonated outside the field of international law.\nBy the end of the last century, however, there was a surge in\nphilosophical engagement with international law. This change is\nreflected in the publication of The Law of Peoples, the last\nbook written by John Rawls (1999), and also in the more\nphilosophically inclined works of prominent international lawyers,\nsuch as Thomas Franck (1995).\n\nThe focus of this entry is on developments that have occurred since\nWorld War II. In the aftermath of World War II, an unprecedentedly\nsophisticated international architecture of legal norms and\ninstitutions, to a large extent associated with the United Nations\nsystem, was established. With the end of the Cold War, and the spread\nof globalization, this architecture reached new heights of ambition,\nclaiming authority over a diverse range of governmental matters that\nwere formerly treated as falling within the exclusive province of\nstate authority. The scope of international law expanded to cover new\nsubject-matter, such as the relationship between the individual and\nthe State, migration, or the environment. Many now perceive the\n\u201cinternational rule-based order\u201d to be imperilled by the\nrise of authoritarian powers, on the one hand, and of populist forces\nin the Western world, on the other; both are said to be hostile to\ninternational law, especially to certain aspects of it like human\nrights (Alston 2017; Ginsburg 2020; Neuman 2020; Wuerth 2017). For\nothers, the expansion of international law poses a challenge to the\nliberal foundations of domestic sovereignty. This entry is inevitably\nselective, focusing on some general conceptual and normative\nquestions, but discussions of the discrete domains of international\nlaw can be found elsewhere in the Stanford Encyclopedia (see e.g., the\nentry on\n human rights).\n",
