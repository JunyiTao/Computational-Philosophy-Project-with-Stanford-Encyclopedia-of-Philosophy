Some Influential Accounts of the Normatively Salient Needs\n\n\nPhilosophers have suggested various ways to identify the needs that\nwarrant normative attention. While there are several common elements\nin these accounts, they also reveal important differences. We review\nhere five of the more prominent accounts in the philosophical\nliterature on needs.\n\n\nHarry Frankfurt (1984) asks how needs must be understood if they are\nto have the special moral significance that we attribute to them\nrelative to mere desires. He argues that we must distinguish between\nfree volitional needs, where an item is needed only to satisfy a\ndesire over which a person has control\u2014he could choose not to\nhave it; constrained volitional needs, where an item is needed to\nsatisfy a desire a person cannot rid himself of, such as an\naddiction; and non-volitional needs that are entirely independent of\ndesires, such as a sick person\u2019s need for medicine. Only in the\ncase of the latter two categories of need will a person be harmed by\nbeing denied what she needs, Frankfurt argues, and it is only these\nneeds that have the special moral force that the language of\n\u2018need\u2019 is usually understood to convey.\n\n\nHarm arising from factors beyond one\u2019s control is also central\nto why needs matter, when they do, on David Wiggins\u2019s account\n(1987, 1998). Wiggins develops these ideas and introduces various\nterms to reflect central features of the concept. There is the gravity\nof the harm that would ensue if the need is not met\n(\u2018badness\u2019), which is different from the\nurgency to prevent harm from ensuing. Needs may be\nentrenched when they are inflexible to modification, or\nsubstitutable when they are not. A need is basic if\nit results from a law of nature, an unalterable and invariable\nenvironmental fact, or a fact about human constitution. Using this\nterminology, Wiggins defines vital needs as ones that are bad in a way\nthat is entrenched and scarcely substitutable, and it is these vital\nneeds that matter morally according to him.\n\n\nDavid Braybrooke (1987) develops an account of basic needs that\nconnects needs to social functioning. For Braybrooke something is a\nbasic need if, without its satisfaction, one would be unable to carry\nout four basic social roles, namely, those of citizen, parent,\nhouseholder, and worker. By reflecting on what is needed to have the\ngenuine choice to adopt the role or carry out tasks associated with\nit, we can arrive at a list of needs. To assist in this process he\nalso examines several proposed lists and extracts many common elements\nthat, over the course of a life, are necessary for the four roles he\nidentifies as important. Focusing on what humans typically do (through\nconsideration of these roles) provides Braybrooke with a good\nreference point for compiling this list. The needs that make the list\nare the need for a life-supporting relation to the environment; for\nwhatever is indispensable to preserving the body intact in important\nrespects (including food, water, exercise, and periodic rest); for\ncompanionship; for education; for social acceptance and recognition;\nfor sexual activity; for recreation; and for freedom from harassment,\nincluding not being continually frightened.\n\n\nLen Doyal and Ian Gough (1991) offer a highly influential account that\naims to connect philosophical and empirical disciplines. On their\nview, needs are universalizable preconditions that enable non-impaired\nparticipation in any form of life. Physical health and autonomy (by\nwhich they mean the mental competence to deliberate and choose) are\nthe two basic needs. An additional class of intermediate needs connect\nthese two basic needs with social science knowledge that can be useful\nin measuring needs fulfilment. The intermediate needs are nutritious\nfood and clean water, protective housing, a non-hazardous work\nenvironment, a non-hazardous physical environment, appropriate health\ncare, security in childhood, significant primary relationships,\nphysical security, economic security, appropriate education, safe\nbirth control, and safe child-bearing. Armed with these intermediate\nneeds they drill down even further, offering specific ideas about the\nkinds of metrics we should adopt to help gain a sense of whether needs\nare being met. These metrics are also helpful in measuring progress\nwith respect to meeting needs over time.\n\n\nDavid Miller (1999, ch. 10; 2007, ch. 7) follows Wiggins conceptually\nin defining needs as conditions that must be met if a person is not to\nsuffer harm. But the harm in question is not merely\nphysiological. Instead, on Miller\u2019s view, a person is harmed\nwhen she is unable to live a minimally decent life in the society to\nwhich she belongs. Needs, therefore, cannot be identified without\nreference to the social norms that define the requirements of decency\nin a particular place. Since this will depend on cultural factors\npeculiar to each society, Miller further distinguishes\nbetween basic needs and societal needs, where the\nformer are understood as the conditions required for a decent life\nin any society, and the latter as the larger set of\nrequirements for a decent life in the particular society to which a\nperson belongs. Thus food is a basic need, while literacy is a\nsocietal need in any technologically advanced society. Miller argues\nthat this societal variability does not impugn the objectivity or\nmoral force of need claims.\n\n\nThere are some important common elements to these and other recent\naccounts of normatively salient needs. The needs that matter morally\nare those that are necessary, indispensable, or inescapable, at least\nwith respect to some important goals such as human functioning in\nsocial groups (Braybrooke 1987, Thomson 1987, Wiggins 1998), our\nability to function as human agents (Copp 1998, Gewirth 1978,\nO\u2019Neill 1998, Shue 1980), or promoting human flourishing (Reader\n2005) especially when we consider the many ways in which human agents\ntypically engage with their social environments. While needs theorists\nare of the view that normatively salient needs must be importantly\nconnected to functioning in social settings, they vary on\nwhether only widely shared needs can have this standing or\nwhether needs that are specific to particular people can have this\nstanding as well. Reader (2007, chs. 4\u20135) is notable for her\nclaim that there is nothing normatively special about needs that are\nrooted in common human nature, though she adds that while this holds\ntrue in moral philosophy, in political philosophy and policy it is\nunderstandable that widely recognized and entrenched needs should be\nthe focus of attention.\n",
