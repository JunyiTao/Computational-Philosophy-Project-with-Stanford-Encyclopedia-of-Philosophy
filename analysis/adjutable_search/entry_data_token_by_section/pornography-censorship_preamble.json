    "main_text": "\n\nCan a government legitimately prevent consenting adults from\npublishing and viewing pornography in private, or would this be an\nunjustified violation of basic freedoms?\n\nThis question lies at the heart of a debate that raises fundamental\nissues about just when, and on what grounds, the state is justified in\nusing its coercive powers to limit individual freedom.\n\nTraditionally, liberals defended the freedom of consenting adults to\npublish and consume pornography in private from moral and religious\nconservatives who wanted pornography banned for its (alleged) obscenity\nand morally corrupting influence on consumers. In more recent times,\nhowever, the pornography debate has taken on a somewhat new and\nsurprising shape. Some feminists have found themselves allied with\ntheir traditional conservative foes in calling on the state to regulate\n(some) pornography\u2014although the primary focus of feminist concern\nis not obscenity, but rather on (alleged) harms to women. And some\nliberals have joined pro-censorship feminists in suggesting that the\nharms that violent, degrading and misogynistic pornography causes to\nwomen\u2019s social standing and opportunities may be sufficiently great to\njustify legal regulation of it. Many others, both liberals and\nfeminists, remain unconvinced. They are doubtful that pornography is a\nsignificant cause of sexual oppression, or that the \u201cblunt and\ntreacherous\u201d instrument of the law is the best solution to\npornography\u2019s harms. As we shall see, debates over whether and how\n(some) pornography is harmful, and what should be done about harmful\ntypes of pornography, are very much alive (Altman and Watson 2018;\nMcGowan 2019; Mikkola 2019).\n",
