    "main_text": "Influence on Philosophical Debates || Culture and Extended Cognition\n4.1 Culture and Extended Cognition\n\nThe cognitive science of culture has become relevant to one of the\nmost provocative and productive ideas put forward in the philosophy of\nmind in recent decades, namely the extended mind thesis (Clark &\nChalmers 1998). This is the claim that minds (human minds, anyway,\nthough perhaps others as well; see Japyass\u00fa & Laland 2017)\ncan and frequently do extend beyond brains and out into the world. The\nthesis can be understood as a particular expression of a broader set\nof ideas that also includes embodied, embedded, and enactivist\napproaches to cognition, and which are often discussed in terms of\nexternalism about the mind (Rowlands, Lau, & Deutsch 2020). The\ncommon thread running through positions characterized as externalist\nis the thought that the boundary between a biological organism and its\nenvironment is less psychologically important than it may\npretheoretically seem. Rather, insists the externalist, many\ninteresting and important mental phenomena span that physical border,\nand what is external to an individual\u2019s skull and skin can be\ndeterminative and even constitutive of their mind and its contents (R.\nWilson 2004).\n\nThis core idea has been developed in several ways. Initial versions of\nexternalism focused on semantics and mental content, holding\nthat what some intentional mental states are about is at least in part\ndetermined by factors outside the body, including social arrangements,\ncultural patterns of expertise and deference, and norms that structure\nthe division of linguistic labor (McGinn 1977; Burge 1979; Fodor 1987,\n1994; cf. Putnam 1975a). Later and more contentious forms of\nexternalism focused on the vehicles of content, holding that\nsome cognitive processes and mental states are themselves located\noutside the head and body. According to this more \u201cactive\u201d\nversion of externalism, when a part of the environment or piece of\ntechnology becomes sufficiently integrated with an individual\u2019s\nother mental processes, that bit of the world external to the skull\nis, strictly speaking, just as much a part of her mind as what\u2019s\ngoing on in her brain. Her cognition extends into the world beyond her\nhead.\n\nThe extended mind thesis is controversial (Rupert 2004; Gertler 2007,\n2012; Adams & Aizawa 2008) and portions of the debates it has\nsparked are informed by an array of views about how to understand the\nrelationship between cognition and different aspects of culture. For\ninstance, Sterelny (2003, 2012) develops the conceptual resources of\nniche construction theory to show how humans actively engineer the\ncultural niches in which they live, learn, and raise children. He\naccepts that the accumulated structure and adaptive information found\nin human environments are key factors for explaining human\nintelligence and behavior, but he stops short of fully embracing the\nextended mind thesis. He holds that human cognitive functioning is\ngreatly enhanced and amplified\u2014scaffolded\u2014by\nsocial, epistemic, and technological resources that are culturally\ntransmitted and located outside the head. But he argues that genuinely\nextended mentality is rare, and should be understood as an\nextreme, limiting case of the more common and theoretically important\nphenomena of cognitive scaffolding (Sterelny 2010).\n\nOthers have explored more specific ideas about how the hallmarks of\nextended cognition are related to human culture and cultural\ncognition. Many have examined aspects and implications of our ability\nto smoothly \u2018couple\u2019 our minds with our technology (Clark\n2007; Palermos 2014; Carter & Palermos 2016) as well as with our\nphysically and socially constructed environments (Hutchins 2008, 2011;\nDavidson & Kelly 2020). Others have explored the idea that culture\nwas part of the design problem that selected for minds that are\ncultural\u2014porous, technologically extendable, deeply socially\npermeable\u2014in exactly these ways (Tomasello 1999; R. Boyd,\nRicherson, & Henrich 2011; Dennett 2017; Kelly & Hoburg 2017;\nMuthukrishna, Doebeli, et al. 2018). Some of this work focuses on\nmaterial culture and technology (Jeffares 2010; Malafouris 2013;\nSterelny 2018), including how artifacts might scaffold or extend\nspecific psychological faculties like memory (Clark 2005; Heersmink\nforthcoming), mathematical cognition (Menary 2015), or economic\nreasoning (Clark 1997b). Other work focuses on sociality and social\norganization (Gallagher 2013; Sterelny 2016, 2021; Carter, Clark,\n& Palermos 2018b; Gallagher, Mastrogiorgio, & Petracca 2019).\nContributors to this strand of research have also explored the ways in\nwhich investigations into the nature of culture and extended cognition\ncan dovetail with and help inform investigations into the nature of\ndistributed cognition, collective mental states, and group agency\n(Hutchins 1995; Tollefsen 2006; Donald 2007; Huebner 2008; Smaldino\n& Richerson 2013; Jablonka 2017). This line of thought has even\ninspired hypotheses about the evolution of human brain size, linking\nincreases in collective intelligence, the division of cognitive labor,\nand the externalization of knowledge with the decrease in the size of\nindividual human brains that appears to have occurred around 3000\nyears ago (DeSilva et al. 2021).\n",
