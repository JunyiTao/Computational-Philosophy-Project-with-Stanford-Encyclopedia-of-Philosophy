    "main_text": "Personal Relationship Goods for Children || The Right to be Loved\n4.2 The Right to be Loved\n\nOn one view (Liao 2006, 2015) children have a right to be loved on\ngrounds of the huge instrumental value that love has for childhood\nwellbeing and development. He claims that the empirical literature\nshows that children who lack love suffer in terms of physical health\nand development, learning ability, interest in interacting with the\nenvironment, ability to sleep and mental health. The right is said to\nbe held by each child primarily against her biological biological\nparents, but all of us have secondary duties to ensure that all\nchildren are loved. A similar claim, that love is irreplaceably\ninstrumental to children leading meaningful childhoods has been\nrecently endorsed (Ferracioli 2014) but also criticized (Grahle\n2016).\n\nThere are several objections to Liao\u2019s thesis. The most\nprominent is that there cannot be rights without correlative duties,\nand there cannot be a duty to do what we cannot do; since we cannot\nfully control our love for particular persons, there cannot be a right\nto love (Cowden 2012b; Brighouse & Swift 2014). Against this\nobjection, (which he anticipates) Liao (2006) argues that we can do\nmore than it is commonly assumed in order to control our feelings of\nlove. However, as Brake (2011) noted, love is responsive to the\nqualities of the beloved\u2014which are outside of the lover\u2019s\ncontrol and which can change\u2014and therefore there are important\nlimits to agent\u2019s abilities to control their loving. This may be\nenough to show that there cannot be a duty to love.\n\nA different objection to the claim that children have a right to be\nloved is that, contra Liao\u2019s interpretation, all that\nthe empirical literature shows is that children require certain\nparental behavior in order the thrive (Cowden 2012a, 339):\n\n\nthe internal emotion of love is neither necessary nor sufficient for\nthe child\u2019s best interests and does not constitute a primary\nessential condition for a good life.\n\n\nIf so, then children have an interest, and possibly a right, only in\nthe behavioral aspects of love which, presumably are possible to\ncontrol. In addition, it may be impossible to measure the impact of\nlove as emotion, rather than as behavior, on children (Cowden 2012a,\n2012b).\n\nFinally, it is possible that some of the intrinsic value of love\nconsists in the confirmation, or maybe conferral, of value on the\nbeloved. This validation depends on the lover enjoying the beloved for\nher own (the lover\u2019s) sake, independently from the lover\u2019s\nwill (or duty) to enjoy her. In turn, this requires that the emotional\nresponse to the beloved is not fully controlled by the lover but\nconsists, at least in part, in a spontaneous reaction to the beloved\n(Gheaus 2017). In this case, too, there cannot be a duty (and hence a\nright) to be loved, because these would be incompatible with the full\nvalue of love. This is the reason why even a perfect love drug, one\ninducing all the subjective experiences and behaviors associated with\nlove, would not be capable of creating the same value that genuine\nlove creates (Nyholm 2015).\n",
