    "main_text": "Works || Bessarion the Theologian\n2.1 Bessarion the Theologian\n\nDuring his years in Greece, Bessarion adopted traditionalist\npositions, which included hostility toward the tenets of the Roman\nChurch and Scholastic theology, which conflicted with the Hesicastic\ncontemplative doctrines still dominant in Greece at that time. The\nexperience of the Council of Ferrara-Florence led him to question and\nabandon some of his previous convictions. This is evident in the\nRefutationes of two writings, respectively by Maximus\nPlanudes (13\u201314th c.) and Marcos Eugenikos (d. 1444,\npresent himself at the Council), in which Bessarion defended the\nprocession of the Spirit from the Son. In other writings, and\nparticularly in the Encyclical letter to the Greeks, composed\nwhen he became Patriarch of Constantinople, he emphasized the primacy\nof the Roman Pontiff, inviting the Greeks to restore the union of the\ntwo Churches which had fallen apart after the Council. In On the\nEucharist, which he translated from Greek to Latin and\nre-elaborated several times over more than two decades, Bessarion\ndefended the epiclesis in the Orthodox Eucharist.\n \nOne of the most interesting theological writings by Bessarion,\nnonetheless, was prompted by a quarrel with George of Trebizond, which\nalong with their disagreements over George\u2019s translations of the\nAristotelian Problemata and Ptolemy\u2019s\nAlmagestus, ultimately led to the deterioration of their\nrelationship. When commenting on John 21:22 during a banquet,\nBessarion had observed that the Latin text of the Vulgate Gospel was\ncorrupted, and rather than reading \u201csic volo eum manere donec\nveniam, quid ad te?\u201d, with reference to John, should have read\n\u201csi volo eum manere donec veniam, quid ad te?\u201d. George of\nTrebizond opposed the Cardinal, defending the Vulgate. Bessarion\nreacted with a short writing, largely based on the philological\nteachings of Nicholas Maniacutia (12th c.), which affirmed\nthe necessity of verifying the Latin text of the Gospels against the\noriginal Greek. For Bessarion, rejection of George\u2019s\nphilological views went hand in hand with a dismissal of his\nmillenarian beliefs: by defending the version containing\n\u201csic\u201d, George had in fact shown that he accepted the idea\nthat John was alive and awaiting the second coming of\nChrist. George\u2019s millenarianism resurfaced\u2014with wider and\ndifferent implications\u2014during the Plato-Aristotle controversy,\nwhich represented the crux of his dispute with Bessarion (see\nbelow).\n",
