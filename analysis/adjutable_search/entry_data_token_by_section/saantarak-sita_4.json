Although there were\nother Indian M\u0101dhyamikas who attempted to incorporate dimensions\nof Yog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra (Mind-Only) thought into their\nMadhyamaka perspective (including \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s\nown disciples Kamala\u015b\u012bla and Haribhadra, as well as\npredecessors like \u0100rya Vimuktisena, \u015arigupta,\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha), \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita is undoubtedly\nthe most noteworthy and most famous Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-Madhyamaka\n synthesizer.[10]\n There are two primary areas where we find Yog\u0101c\u0101ra ideas\nincorporated into \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s thought: his\npresentation of conventional truths where he describes them as being\nof the nature of consciousness, and his conventional acceptance of\nself-cognizing consciousness or reflexive awareness\n(svasa\u1e43vedana).\n\nOne of the fundamental tenets of the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra schools of Buddhist thought is the\nassertion that phenomena are not of an utterly distinct nature from\nconsciousness. The pan-Mah\u0101y\u0101na idea of emptiness is in fact\ndescribed in this way Yog\u0101c\u0101ras/Cittam\u0101tras, by\nclaiming that emptiness refers to an object\u2019s lack of a nature\nthat is distinct from the consciousness perceiving it. This is\ncontrasted with the common Madhyamaka description of emptiness as\nreferring to an object\u2019s lack or emptiness of its own nature or\nessence in and of itself. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita incorporates\nthis Yog\u0101c\u0101ra line of thinking into his presentation of\nconventional truths when he writes in the ninety-first stanza of\nMA:\n\nThat which is cause and result is mere consciousness only. Whatever is\nestablished by itself abides in\n consciousness.[11]\n\n\nThis statement refers to his earlier descriptions of conventional\ntruths (cited above) where he describes conventional truths as\nphenomena that have the ability to function and which generate and\ndisintegrate. In M\u0101dhyamika discourse, \u201cThat which is cause\nand result,\u201d is simply another way of referring to conventional\ntruths. It refers to that which is impermanent, dependently-arisen,\nand causally efficacious, the three being co-extensive with each other\nand with conventional truths in general. Thus, by stating that,\n\u201cthat which is cause and result is mere consciousness,\u201d\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita is stating that conventional truths are\nof the nature of consciousness. This is an ultimate description of\nreality for proponents of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra\nsystems, but for \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita here, this is part of\nhis presentation of conventional truths, thus, incorporating a\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra orientation for his presentation of\nconventional truths.\n\nA further development of this philosophical synthesis that\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita is putting forth is described even more\nexplicitly in the next stanza, the ninety-second:\n\nBy relying on the Mind-Only (Cittam\u0101tra, Sems tsam pa)\nsystem, know that external entities do not exist. And by relying on\nthis [Middle Way (Madhyamaka, dbU ma)] system, know that no\nself exists at all, even in that\n [mind].[12]\n\n\nHere we find a particularly important and unique aspect of\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s presentation of the two truths.\nIt is not merely that he incorporates aspects of Mind-Only thinking\ninto his presentation that makes it unique. It is unique because for\nvirtually all of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s Madhyamaka\npredecessors in India, the two truths are utilized solely as a vehicle\nfor presenting the ontological status of entities. It is done by way\nof describing the mode of being for various objects of knowledge\n(ultimate truths and conventional truths). This common Madhyamaka way\nof approaching the two truths is present in\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita as well, but there is more here. In\naddition to stating the ultimate truths exist in x way and\nconventional truths exist in y way,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita is also using his presentation of\nconventional truths as a stepping stone for his readers. A proper\nunderstanding of conventional truths takes a person part of the way\ntowards an understanding of the ultimate. Previous Madhyamaka\npresentations of conventional truths do not incorporate this practical\ndimension. For \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, conventional truths are\nnot completely mistaken. By properly understanding conventional truths\n(i.e., as a follower of Cittam\u0101tra tenets understands\nthe ultimate), one is well on the way to a proper understanding of the\nultimate from his Madhyamaka perspective\u2014the most subtle and\naccurate philosophical presentation of reality. There is a dynamic\nstep at work in \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s presentation of\nthe two truths; first one understands that entities are not of a\ndistinct nature from that of the mind (as Mind-Only proponents claim)\nand then they progress to realize that nothing exists in and of itself\n(the Madhyamaka perspective), even the mind. This dynamic engagement\nwith conventional truths is unique among Madhyamaka thinkers and a\ncritical innovation in the thought of\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita.\n",
