    "main_text": "Principia Ethica\n3. Principia Ethica\n\n\nThe main achievement of Moore's early period is his book\nPrincipia Ethica. It was published in 1903 but was the\nculmination of the reflections which Moore commenced in his 1897\ndissertation on \u2018The Metaphysical basis of Ethics\u2019. The\nmain impetus, however, came from a series of lectures in London on\n\u2018The Elements of Ethics\u2019 which Moore gave late in 1898.\nMoore had the text of these lectures typed up with a view to publishing\nthem; but as his thoughts progressed he reworked his text and\nPrincipia Ethica is the result of this reworking (the lectures\nhave recently been published as The Elements of Ethics). Most\nof the first three chapters come from the 1898 lectures; whereas the\nlast three chapters are largely new material.\n\n\nIn the first three chapters Moore sets out his criticisms of\n\u2018ethical naturalism\u2019. At the core of these criticisms is\nthe thesis that the position involves a fallacy, the\n\u2018naturalistic fallacy\u2019, of supposing that goodness, which\nMoore takes to be the fundamental ethical value, can be defined in\nnaturalistic terms, in terms, say, of pleasure or desire or the course\nof evolution. As against all such claims Moore insists that goodness is\nindefinable, or unanalysable, and thus that ethics is an autonomous\nscience, irreducible to natural science or, indeed, to metaphysics.\nMoore's main argument against the possibility of any such definition of\ngoodness is that when we confront a putative definition, such as that\nto be good is to be something which we desire to desire, we can tell\nthat this is not a claim that is true by definition because its truth\nremains for us an \u2018open question\u2019 in the sense that it\nremains sensible to doubt it in a way which would not be possible if it\nwere just a definition which makes explicit our understanding of the\nwords. The merits of this argument are questionable; in many cases we\ncan sensibly doubt the truth of a definition, especially where the\ndefinition makes use of discoveries that have not been part of our\nordinary understanding, as is normally the case with definitions in the\nnatural sciences. But there is, I think, a way of modifying Moore's\nargument which takes it around this objection, namely by taking it to\nrest on the epistemological thesis that ethical questions cannot be\nanswered without the explicit involvement of ethical beliefs. The\nreason that this thesis is inimical to naturalistic definitions of\nethical values is that an important role of definitions in the natural\nsciences and elsewhere is that they enable one to answer questions in\nnew ways that would not otherwise be possible: it is thanks to the\ndefinition of water as H2O, and not in terms of its familiar\nphenotype, that we can be confident that some comets are mainly\ncomposed of water. But there is no way in which we would accept that\nthe answer to a novel ethical question, for example concerning the\nacceptability of the use of human embryos for stem cell research, is to\nbe found by finding a definition of ethical values which enables us to\nanswer this question without drawing on beliefs that are expressed with\nthe familiar ethical \u2018phenotype\u2019, i.e., explicitly ethical\nconcepts.\n\n\nThis defence of Moore's argument does not address a different\nconcern, namely that the argument applies only to versions of ethical\nnaturalism which involve a definition of ethical value, and thus that\nnaturalist positions which maintain that ethical value is an\nirreducible natural property are not touched by the argument. Moore's\nargument against positions of this kind rests on the claim that the\nethical value of a situation is not a feature of it which is\nindependent of its other properties; on the contrary it depends on its\nother properties. As he puts it in the preface he composed for the\nsecond edition of Principia Ethica, but never actually\npublished, a thing's \u2018intrinsic value\u2019 depends on its\n\u2018intrinsic nature\u2019, and he glosses this dependence in terms\nof the relationship which we now call \u2018supervenience\u2019\n(though Moore does not use the term): things with the same intrinsic\nnature, or natural properties, must have the same intrinsic value (see\n\u2018The Conception of Intrinsic Value\u2019 286). Moore took it\nthat supervenience was not an inherently reductive relationship, and\nthus that it was consistent for him to hold that goodness is not a\nnatural property even though it supervenes upon natural properties;\nbut, he assumed, if one takes the view that goodness is itself a\nnatural property, the fact that it supervenes upon other natural\nproperties makes it impossible to avoid a reductive thesis. So the\nsupervenience of intrinsic value removes the option of a non-reductive\nnaturalism without contradicting his version of ethical\nnon-naturalism.\n\n\nSubsequent discussion has shown that the relationship between\nsupervenience and reduction is a complicated matter, and though I think\nthat Moore's position is defensible this is not the place to take the\nissue further. Instead I want to turn to the concept of intrinsic value\nwhich is central to Moore's theory. One aspect of this is easy, namely\nthe distinction between the \u2018intrinsic\u2019 value of a\nsituation and its \u2018instrumental\u2019 value: this is the\ndistinction between the value inherent in a situation and that which\ndepends only on the situation's consequences. Despite this distinction\nit remains the case that intrinsic value is the fundamental type of\nethical value, since instrumental value is definable in terms of the\nintrinsic value of a situation's consequences. But intrinsic value is\nnot merely non-instrumental value; for it is also to be distinguished\nfrom what Moore calls the \u2018value as a part\u2019 of a situation,\nnamely the extra contribution which the situation makes to the value of\na complex situation of which it is a \u2018part\u2019, over and above\nits intrinsic value. This is not a conception which is familiar to us,\nbut Moore illustrates the point by the following case: although\nknowledge has little intrinsic value, the value of the aesthetic\nappreciation of a beautiful work of art (which is, according to Moore,\npotentially one of the most valuable things there is) is greatly\nenhanced by knowledge about it. So this kind of knowledge can have a\nsubstantial \u2018value as a part\u2019 even though it has little\nintrinsic value. As before intrinsic value remains the fundamental\nconception of value, since a situation's value as a part is defined in\nterms of the overall intrinsic value of a complex situation to which it\nmakes a contribution beyond its own intrinsic value. Nonetheless this\npoint implies that a thing's intrinsic value is not simply its value\nirrespective of its consequences; it is also its value irrespective of\nits context. Hence the concept of intrinsic value is to be such that a\ntype of situation has the same intrinsic value in all contexts \u2014\nwhich is why Moore holds that its intrinsic value depends only on its\n\u2018intrinsic nature\u2019.\n\n\nThere are two connected problems here: the first concerns the way in\nwhich something's \u2018value as a part\u2019 depends on accepting\nthat when it occurs as an element of a complex situation it may affect\nthe latter's value in a way which is not simply the result of taking\nits intrinsic value into account. This judgement is enshrined by Moore\nin his \u2018principle of organic unities\u2019, which declares that\nthis kind of non-aggregative valuation of complex situations is liable\nto occur. The problem here is not that Moore's principle is incorrect,\nbut rather that it seems irrational since it puts a block on moral\nreasoning. The second problem concerns the thesis that intrinsic value\nis the same in all contexts. For this just seems wrong, in that the\nvalue of, say, friendship differs from one context to another.\nAlthough, as Moore rightly says, friendship is normally one of the most\nvaluable things there is, it has no value at all where claims of\njustice are at stake, as in a court of law. So Moore's conception of\nabsolutely universal intrinsic values should be replaced by a\nconception which allows for the \u2018bracketing\u2019 of normal\nvalues in certain contexts; and once this is in place, along with a\nmore sophisticated account of normative values than Moore provides, it\nis reasonable to hope that the phenomena captured by Moore's irrational\nprinciple of organic unities will find a more comprehensible\ninterpretation.\n\n\nAnother area where Moore's ethical theory is problematic is his\naccount of ethical knowledge. Because of his hostility to ethical\nnaturalism Moore denies that ethical knowledge is a matter of empirical\nenquiry. But, as we have seen, he is equally hostile to Kant's\nrationalist thesis that fundamental ethical truths are truths of\nreason. Instead he holds that ethical knowledge rests on a capacity for\nan intuitive grasp of fundamental ethical truths for which we can give\nno reason since there is no reason to be given. The trouble with this\nis that if we can say nothing to support a claim to such knowledge,\nthose who disagree with it can only register their disagreement and\npass on; hence ethical debate is liable to turn into the expression of\nconflicting judgements which admit of no resolution. In the light of\nthis, it is not surprising that Moore's ethical theory was regarded as\nundermining the cognitive status of morality, and thus that it led\ndirectly to the development of ethical non-cognitivism by those who\nwere influenced by Moore, such as A. J. Ayer and C. L. Stevenson. Yet\nthere was another side to Moore's discussion of ethical issues, in\nwhich he found himself arguing against the hedonist thesis that\npleasure is the only thing with positive intrinsic value, despite the\nfact that officially he held that no such arguments could be given.\nWhen engaged in this kind of \u2018indirect\u2019 method of argument,\nMoore sees himself as seeking to obtain agreement rather than to\nestablish the truth, though he also acknowledges that from a\nfirst-person point of view there is little difference here. Because\nthis indirect method is not integrated into his official method of\nethical inquiry, he says little about its presuppositions. But it seems\nto me that one can find here the beginnings of a \u2018common\nsense\u2019 approach to ethics which is distinctly preferable to his\nofficial appeal to intuitive judgments concerning the relative\nintrinsic value of situations of arbitrary complexity.\n\n\nSo far I have discussed Moore's \u2018metaethics\u2019, his views\nabout the metaphysics of ethical value and the nature of ethical\nknowledge. This emphasis reflects the fact that this aspect of Moore's\nethical theory has been most influential; but it is also worth\nmentioning briefly some points from his moral theory. Moore presents a\nstraightforward consequentialist account of the relationship between\nthe right and the good: the right action is that which will produce the\nbest outcome. In practice, because it is so difficult for us to\ndetermine by ourselves what is the best outcome, he allows that we\nprobably do best if we follow established rules; thus Moore ends up\nrecommending a conservative form of rule consequentialism, for which he\nwas criticised by Keynes and Russell. Later critics such as W. D. Ross\nargued that because Moore subjects our personal responsibilities to the\nimpersonal test of producing the best outcome his position does not\nadequately capture the way in which they arise from our relationships\nwith particular people; as recent critics put it, Moore's moral theory\nis resolutely \u2018agent-neutral\u2019 and for that reason\ninadequate as an account of the personal responsibilities which involve\nirreducibly \u2018agent-relative\u2019 values.\n\n\nFinally, in the last chapter of Principia Ethica,Moore sets\nout his \u2018ideal\u2019 \u2014 a deliberately unsystematic list of\nintrinsic goods (such as friendship and the appreciation of beauty) and\nintrinsic evils (such as consciousness of pain). Moore's choice of\nvalues is striking: it connects with the \u2018Bloomsbury\u2019 ideal\nof life devoted to Art and Love, and excludes social values such as\nequality and freedom. The individualism of the resulting morality is\nenhanced by the fact that Moore maintains that these intrinsic values\nare incommensurable, and thus that the assessment of priorities among\nthem is inescapably a matter of individual judgment. As Keynes put it,\nMoore's ideal was a kind of secular \u2018religion\u2019 - not much\nuse for public policy but fine for talented individuals who could agree\nto differ in their detailed value judgments.\n",
