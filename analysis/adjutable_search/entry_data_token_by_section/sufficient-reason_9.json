    "main_text": "The PSR in Eighteenth-Century Philosophy and German Idealism\n7. The PSR in Contemporary Philosophy\n\nIt has recently been proposed by Dasgupta that a version of the PSR\ncould be formulated in terms of grounds. Grounding is said to be a\nkind of explanation distinct from causal explanation. It is a\nmetaphysical or constitutive explanation. It is generally taken to be\nasymmetric, irreflexive, and transitive. Alleged examples of grounding\nrelations are: dispositions (e.g., fragility) are grounded in\ncategorical features (e.g., molecular structure); semantic facts\n(e.g., Jones means addition by \u201c+\u201d) are grounded\nby non-semantic facts (e.g., Jones is disposed to draw certain\ninferences); mental properties (e.g., pain) are grounded by physical\nproperties (e.g., c-fibers firing; see Rosen 2010 and Fine 2012). The\nproposal is formulated as follows:\n\n\nPSR: For every substantive fact \\(Y\\) there are some facts, the\n\\(X\\)s, such that (i) the \\(X\\)s ground \\(Y\\) and (ii)\neach one of the \\(X\\)s is autonomous. (Dasgupta 2016: 12)\n\n\nHere substantive means apt for grounding and\nautonomous means not apt for grounding. For example, perhaps\nessentialist facts are autonomous where essentialist facts are facts\nof the form: it is essential to \\(x\\) that \\(\\phi\\). The\nidea is that just as definitions are not apt for proof, essentialist\nfacts are not apt for grounding explanations, that is, they are\nautonomous (Dasgupta 2016: 6\u20139). The notion of an autonomous\nfact allows the adherent of this version of the PSR to avoid the\nAgrippan Trilemma without allowing for self-explanatory facts or\ninfinite regresses. Chains of explanation terminate with autonomous\nfacts, which are not brute because they are not apt for\nexplanation.\n\nFollowing Bolzano (Theory of Science: vol. II,\n259\u2013264), most contemporary theories of grounding affirm the\nirreflexivity of this relation (see Fine 2001: 15; Schaffer 2009: 364;\nand Rosen 2010: 115). More recently, Fine showed that given certain\nplausible premises, one may point out counterexamples to irreflexivity\n(Fine 2010; cf. Kr\u00e4mer 2013), and the issue has been further\nchallenged by Jenkins (2011).\n\nJonathan Schaffer has relied on the notion of ground to revive an\nAristotelian, structured metaphysics, i.e., a metaphysics which is\nordered by priority relations (Schaffer 2009), and to defend Priority\nMonism (see the entry on\n monism).\n In response, Michael Della Rocca (2014) has argued that strict\nadherence to the PSR\u2014and to Ockham\u2019s Razor (see the entry\non\n simplicity)\u2014undermines\n Schaffer\u2019s structured metaphysics (and Priority Monism), since\ninsofar as all the features of the grounded are already present in the\nground, the existence of the grounded is just redundant. (See also the\nentry on\n metaphysical grounding).\n More recently, in his audacious 2020 book, Della Rocca expanded his\nargument. Relying on what he takes to be a strict adherence to the\nPSR, and assisted by F.H. Bradley\u2019s critique of the reality of\nrelation, Della Rocca argues that we are entitled to assert only the\nexistence of undifferentiated being that stands in no relations of\ndistinction. According to Della Rocca, our major philosophical\nconcepts \u2013 substance, action, knowledge, meaning, and\nexplanation \u2013 fail to meet the strict requirements of the PSR.\nToward the end of the book, Della Rocca launches a powerful attack on\nthe widespread reliance on intuitions among analytic philosophers\n(Della Rocca, 2020, 260\u2013290).\n\nThe question of the justification for the employment of the PSR has\nbeen addressed in some recent literature (see, for example, Della\nRocca (2010)). Fatema Amijee has argued that from a practical point of\nview, participants in structural inquiry (i.e., an inquiry which\nattempts to explain why a given fact obtains) must assume the PSR as\nlong as they do not discover that any fact is brute. Since structural\ninquiry is intrinsically valuable (and assists us in discovering new\ntruths), it is rationally non-optional for us, and consequently, we\nmust be committed to the PSR (Amijee 2022).\n\nImplications for the PSR might also be discerned in recent discussions\nof surprisingness or strikingness, (although such\nimplications are not typically stated explicitly). These discussions,\nwhich cut across such diverse subfields as epistemology, philosophy of\nscience, metaethics, and philosophy of religion, have their origin in\nPaul Horwich\u2019s observation that there is an intuitive difference\nbetween an event or fact being unlikely and its being\nsurprising (Horwich 1982). For example, it is equally\nunlikely that, on a given occasion, a monkey typing randomly on a\ntypewriter will type the string \u2018sdlek93 91\u2019 and that it\nwill type \u2018I want a banana.\u2019 But although the\nprobabilities of both events are the same, the latter string is\nsurprising in a way that the former is not. The difference between\nsurprising events or facts and unlikely fact is sometimes thought to\nmap onto the distinction between events or facts that call out for\nexplanation and those that do not. How can we account for the\ndifference between the merely improbable\u2014which some believe does\nnot call out for explanation\u2014and the surprising\u2014which\ndoes? Often it is said that the surprising requires us to challenge\nour background beliefs and confirms hypotheses that are alternatives\nto those beliefs. Alternatively, that a theory T treats something\nsurprising as inexplicable is a reason to disbelieve T (White 2007;\nSchechter 2013). Thus, such inquiry is guided by the presumption that\nthe surprising is explicable. Principles such as these have led\nphilosophers to substantive conclusions as diverse as: (1) the\nuniverse was designed by an intelligent agent (White 2017; van Inwagen\n1993); (2) moral realism is false (Street 2006; Enoch 2011); (3) there\nexists a multiverse (Leslie 1989; Parfit 1998); and Platonism about\nmathematics is false (Field 1989, 2005). Unfortunately, we cannot\ndiscuss the details of the arguments from the improbable/surprising\ndistinction to these claims here. Nevertheless, this methodological\nassumption has interesting repercussions for the PSR. First of all,\nthose who advocate the distinction tend to suggest that, if the PSR is\ntrue, then it is so only in a restricted form. After all, the point of\nthe distinction is that some things call out for explanation and\nothers do not. But it also suggests that something like a restricted\nPSR is true. A principle that says that we have an epistemic\nreason to believe a hypothesis that would transform a surprising event\nof fact into an unsurprising one would only be truth conducive if we\nlived in a world in which events and facts are\u2014at least for the\nmost part\u2014explicable. Why this is so can be illuminated by\nanalogy with induction. As Hume observed, induction is truth conducive\nonly if nature is uniform (T. 1.3.6.4). So, by committing ourselves to\nthe method of induction, we thereby presuppose the truth of the\nprinciple of the uniformity of nature. Similarly, by taking\nourselves to have an epistemic reason to believe a theory because it\nrenders explicable what is otherwise surprising, we thereby presuppose\nthe truth of a restricted PSR. \n\nThe role of the PSR in ethics and political theory has not been\nseriously studied so far. Clearly, the PSR may be marshaled in order\nto question our reliance on mere intuitions. The repugnance of a\ncertain view cannot be taken at face value, but rather requires a\njustification. In the past, various conservative views relied merely\non the alleged repugnance of certain sexual acts (e.g., homosexuality,\ninterracial relations). The requirement to dig deeper and ask a person\nto justify her intuitions may help the person understand the maxims\nguiding her specific moral beliefs. Adherence to the PSR may also\nshift the onus of proof in the debate between those who consider our\npreferential evaluation of human beings over other things in nature as\nsimply brute (Williams 2006: 195) and those who insist that if human\nbeings have a special value, there must be a reason for the ascription\nof such value (Buss 2012: 343).\n",
