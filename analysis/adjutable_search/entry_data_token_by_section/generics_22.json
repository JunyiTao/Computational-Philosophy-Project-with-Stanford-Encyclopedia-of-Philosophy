    "main_text": "Beyond Language: Philosophical Applications of Generics || Generics, Stereotyping and Prejudice\n5.2 Generics and Philosophy More Generally\n\nSome philosophers have recently applied the study of generics to a\nrange of long-standing philosophical issues and puzzles. As a\nfascinating illustration, Roy Sorensen (2012) argues that a proper\nunderstanding of generics can solve the sorites paradox. An example of\nthe sorites paradox is the following: 1 is a small number; small\nnumbers have small successors; therefore 1,000,000,000 is a small\nnumber. The second premise is the inductive step, and is here\nformulated as a generic. Sorensen proposes that, like most generics,\nthe inductive step admits of exceptions: there are some (or at least\none) small numbers whose successor is not itself a small number. If\nthis is so, then the paradox is resolved: the argument is simply\ninvalid. In order for the argument to be valid, the inductive step\ncannot be an exception-tolerating generic, but rather an exceptionless\nuniversal, e.g., for all n, if n is a small\nnumber, so is \\(n+1\\). Indeed, the paradox is often formulated in\nthis way\u2014i.e., with a universal as the inductive step. Here,\nhowever, Sorensen argues that we are simply interpreting the universal\nas a generic, just as when adults accept \u201call ducks lay\neggs\u201d despite knowing that male ducks do not lay eggs (Leslie et\nal. 2011).\n\nA similar strategy is applied by Mahrad Almotahari (2022) to the\nkal\u0101m cosmological argument: Everything that begins\nto exist has a cause for its existence; the universe began to exist;\ntherefore the universe has a cause for its existence. Almotahari\nargues that acceptance of the first premise of the argument rests on\nthe generic overgeneralization effect. Certainly, anything that we\nencounter in ordinary life that begins to exist has a cause, and it is\nentirely reasonable to accept the corresponding generic things\nthat begin to exist have causes for their existence. But the\nkal\u0101m cosmological argument requires a universal\ngeneralization, not a generic one, and Almotahari argues that this is\na step to which we are not entitled.\n\nAdditionally, generics have been said to solve, or at least\nilluminate, other long-standing philosophical puzzles. For example,\nKai Yuan Cheng (2011) argues that a proper understanding of generics\nand habituals can help resolve the Kripke/Wittgenstein rule-following\nparadox. Bernhard Nickel (2010, 2014) has argued that generics can be\nused to analyze ceteris paribus laws; similarly, Asher and\nDaniel Bonevac (1996, 1997) have relied on a normalcy-based approach\nto generics to provide an account of prima facie obligation.\nMichael Graff Fara (2005) and Ryan Wasserman (2011) both recruit\ngenerics and habituals to give accounts of dispositions.\n\nReflection on generics has also influenced debates about philosophical\nmethodology. Mark Johnston (2016) suggests that certain well-known\ninadequacies of the \u201cmethod of cases\u201d in the philosophy of\npersonal identity can be explained by the fact that we as philosophers\nhave treated what is in fact merely generic-based\u2014and thus\nexception-tolerating\u2014knowledge of the application conditions of\nour concepts as if it were knowledge of universal necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the application of the relevant concepts.\nJohnston and Leslie (2012, 2019) rely on similar considerations to\nquestion the philosophical methodology known as the Canberra Plan.\nLastly, Lerner and Leslie (2013) argue that a greater understanding of\nthe role of generics in moral cognition undermines certain\napplications of the method of reflective equilibrium within normative\nethics.\n",
