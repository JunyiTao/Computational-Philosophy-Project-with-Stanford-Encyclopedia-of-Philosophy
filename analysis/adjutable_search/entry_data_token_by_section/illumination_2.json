    "main_text": "Augustine\n3. Augustine\n\n\nThroughout his long literary career, Augustine (354\u2013430) stresses the\nrole of divine illumination in human thought. One could choose almost\nany work to illustrate this point; here I will focus on the most\nfamiliar of all, the Confessions, where Augustine invokes\ndivine illumination constantly, and makes bold claims for its global\nnecessity: \nThe mind needs to be enlightened by light from outside\nitself, so that it can participate in truth, because it is not itself\nthe nature of truth. You will light my lamp, Lord (IV.xv.25). \n\n\n\nNone other than you is teacher of the truth, wherever and from\nwhatever source it is manifest (V.vi.10).\n\n\nYou hear nothing true from me which you have not first told me\n(X.ii.2).\n\n\nTruth, when did you ever fail to walk with me, teaching me what to\navoid and what to seek\u2026. Without you I could discern none of these\nthings (X.xl.65).\n\n\n\nEven during the Middle Ages, Augustine\u2019s readers disagreed on the\nprecise nature of his theory. One thing that seems clear from these\npassages alone is that divine illumination is an influence that we\nreceive in an ongoing way throughout our lives. Thomas Aquinas would\nlater understand illumination as an infusion all at once at the start\n(see below), but this seems untenable as an interpretation of\nAugustine. The mind needs to be enlightened \u201cfrom outside itself\u201d; \u201cit\nis not itself the nature of truth\u201d; \u201cyou will light my lamp,\nLord\u201d (he has not done so already); truth \u201cwalk[s] with me,\u201d rather\nthan merely setting me in motion at the start.\n\n\nTo speak of this influence as an illumination is of course to use a\nmetaphor, one not likely to be unpacked fully. Our own minds present\nenough of a puzzle to us: when we try to understand how the divine mind\nmight influence our own, we must inevitably fall back on metaphor.\nStill, there are a variety of ways in which we might seek some\nclarification. In particular, it is helpful to distinguish two ways in\nwhich God might provide illumination. First, he might simply give us\ninformation of certain kinds, telling us how things are. This is how\nillumination is most often understood, at least implicitly. But a\nsecond possibility is that God would provide not the information\nitself, but the insight into the truth of the information. On this\nsecond model, we would frame beliefs on our own, and God would\nilluminate our minds so that we could see the truth. In other words,\nGod would supply the justification. It is clear that sometimes\nillumination takes the first form: much of Biblical revelation just is\nillumination in this sense. But Augustine\u2019s theory of illumination\nseems largely to be of the second kind. Consider this famous passage\nfrom the Confessions:\nIf we both see that what you say is true, and we both see\nthat what I say is true, then where do we see that? Not I in you, nor\nyou in me, but both of us in that unalterable truth that is above our\nminds (XII.xxv.35).\n\n\nAt issue here is biblical interpretation. When a reading is advanced\nthat seems clearly correct, how is it that everyone listening grasps\nthe truth of that reading? It is not that God gives us the\ninterpretation itself, but that he allows us to see that the\ninterpretation is true. \n\n\nThis understanding of illumination is particularly apparent in the\nDe magistro, where Augustine argues that only God can teach\nus. Of course, other people can tell us things, and can thereby\ncommunicate ideas to us. And we can believe what others tell us:\nindeed, our lives would be impoverished if we didn\u2019t regularly accept\nwhat others tell us. But all of this stays at the level of mere belief.\nIt is not knowledge unless we grasp with our minds the truth of what we\nare hearing:\nWhen I speak the truth, I do not teach someone who sees\nthese truths. For he is taught not by my words but by the things\nthemselves made manifest within when God discloses them\n(12.40).\n\n\nThe speaker\u2019s role is not irrelevant in this process. My words give \nlisteners an idea that they can then verify for themselves in light of God\u2019s\nillumination. Illumination is what allows us to go from mere true\nbelief to knowledge. Illumination provides justification. \n\n\nThis account is most attractive in cases of a priori knowledge or\npure reasoning, where we grasp through the mind alone that an argument\nis valid or that a conclusion is necessary. But there is another strain\nof thought running through Augustine, one that focuses on the mind\u2019s\nability to transcend the untrustworthy senses and grasp the truth that\nlies beyond mere appearances. The following passage is very often cited\nin this connection:\nEverything that the bodily senses attain, that which is\nalso called sensible, is incessantly changing\u2026. But what is not\nconstant cannot be perceived; for that is perceived that is\ncomprehended in knowledge. But something that is incessantly changing\ncannot be comprehended. Therefore we should not expect pure truth from\nthe bodily senses (Eighty-three Different Questions,\nq.9).\n\n\nIn one stroke, this argument rules out the physical world as an object\nof pure truth, and rules out the senses as a source for that truth. It\nmust be the mind, then, with which we attain truth, and that truth must\nbe something beyond the sensible world. Plainly, the mind cannot rely\non the senses. But what else is there? The conclusion we are invited to\nreach is that the mind must rely on God. \n\n\nOne might try assimilating this line of thought to those passages\nwhere Augustine has in mind necessary a priori truths. But it is more\nnatural to take this in a different way, as an account of how the mind\ngoes beyond the sensible data to a grasp of the real essences of\nthings. Accordingly, the theory of divine illumination would be put to\ntwo very different sorts of work in the later Middle Ages: as an\naccount of a priori knowledge, and as an account of concept formation.\nEach account raises its own set of issues. Taken in the first way,\ndivine illumination has to compete against the claim that the mind is\nnaturally capable of grasping such truth. Taken in the second way,\nquestions immediately arise about the nature of conceptual knowledge.\nDo essences (or properties in general) exist in the physical world? Do\nthey exist only in the divine mind? Do the senses play any role in the\nprocess of concept formation? Later medieval philosophers would handle\nthese issues in interestingly different ways.\n",
