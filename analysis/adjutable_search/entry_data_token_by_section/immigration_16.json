    "main_text": "Applied Questions in Immigration || Recruiting Immigrants\n3.3 Recruiting Immigrants\n\n\nThe vast bulk of the discussion concerning the morality of\nimmigration concerns the exclusion of outsiders, but some also worry\nabout the way in which wealthy countries currently admit skilled\nworkers from poorer states, especially when the specialists are\nactively recruited away from their native lands. This practice\nwould not garner the attention of moral theorists if it were restricted\nto countries like the United States targeting the most talented\nlong-distance runners from Kenya, for instance, but it is thought to\nrise to the level of injustice when the wealthiest countries actively\nrecruit professionals from developing countries where people with their\nskill sets are already in terribly short supply. Perhaps the most\nnoteworthy and worrisome instance of this is the manner in which\nwealthy, western states actively recruit medical professionals away\nfrom Africa. As Gillian Brock comments, \u201cArguably, it is\nnot the total number of health care professionals that exist in the\nworld today that is a problem, but rather their distribution.\nConsider how, for instance, while only 21 per cent of the world\u2019s\npopulation resides in Europe and North America, it commands 45 per cent\nof the world\u2019s doctors and 61 of its nurses. Africa, which\ncontains 13 per cent of the world\u2019s population, has only 3 per\ncent of its doctors and 5 per cent of its nurses. An estimated\n1.3 per cent of the world\u2019s health care workers provide services\nto 13.8 per cent of the world\u2019s population in a region suffering\n25 per cent of the world\u2019s disease burden.\u201d (Brock 2009:\n200)\n\n\nGiven both the relative shortage of health care professionals in\nAfrica and the fact that many posit a human right to a decent minimum\nlevel of health care, the recruitment (if not the mere admission) of\ndoctors and nurses from developing countries would seem to raise human\nrights issues. An obvious response, then, would be to issue a\nblanket prohibition on the emigration of health care professionals from\ncountries where they are in desperately short supply. This\nextreme measure strikes many as problematic, though, for the way in\nwhich it curtails the individual liberty of the skilled workers in the\npoor countries. A more subtle response, then, would be to insist\nonly that the adoptive countries provide adequate compensation to the\nstates from which the talented individuals emigrate. Thus, just\nas those who worry about deforestation urge that all those who chop\ndown mature trees should be held responsible for planting even more\nyoung trees in their place, authors like Brock (2009) suggest that it\nwould not be too much to ask those countries who admit skilled workers\nfrom countries where they are already in short supply to provide\ncompensatory resources which will assist these poor countries in their\nfuture efforts to train and retain the next generation of such\nprofessionals.\n",
