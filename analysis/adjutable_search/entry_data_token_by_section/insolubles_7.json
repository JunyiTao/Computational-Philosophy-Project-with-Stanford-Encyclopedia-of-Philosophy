    "main_text": "Early Developments to the 1320s || The Theory of Transcasus\n2.2 The Theory of Transcasus\n\nThe theory of transcasus has nothing to do with the fallacy\nsecundum quid et simpliciter, although it too seems to have\nhad its origins in antiquity. The word transcasus is not a\ncommon Latin word. It seems to be a literal translation of Greek\nmetaptosis. In Stoic logic, propositions that change their\ntruth value over time were called metapiptonta (from the same\nroot). Walter Burley in fact used the word transcasus exactly\nthis way in 1302 in two short logical works (Spade 1987:\n33\u201334).\n\nNevertheless, in the particular context of insolubles, while the term\ntranscasus does have an association with time, it does not\nimply any change of truth value over time. Rather the theory\nof transcasus held that in the proposition \u201cThis\nstatement is false\u201d, the term \u201cfalse\u201d refers\nnot to the proposition in which it occurs, but rather to some\nproposition uttered earlier. Thus, when the liar says \u201cI am\nlying\u201d, what he really means is \u201cWhat I said just a moment\nago was a lie\u201d. If the speaker did not in fact say anything\nearlier, then his present statement is simply false and no paradox\n arises.[14]\n\nThis view, like the last of those discussed in\n Section 2.4\n below, amounts in practice to a restriction on self-reference. But it\nis not clear exactly what motivated it. In any event, the theory of\ntranscasus appears to have disappeared as a theory actually\nheld by anyone after the early period, although it continued to be\nmentioned in later authors\u2019 surveys of earlier\n views.[15]\n",
