    "main_text": "Intersubstantial Causation\n4. Intersubstantial Causation\n\nSince Leibniz seems to think that intersubstantial causation requires\nphysical influx and physical influx is unacceptable, he concludes,\nlogically enough, that we must reject intersubstantial causation. But\nNicholas Jolley notes that Leibniz does not always argue this way. For\nwhile consistently rejecting the existence of influx, sometimes\nLeibniz will not at the same time reject outright the existence of\nintersubstantial causation. \u201cLeibniz sometimes suggests that our\nordinary statements about causal interaction can be understood in such\na way that they come out true\u201d (Jolley 1998, 595). Nevertheless,\nJolley continues, \u201cWhen Leibniz simply denies the existence of\ncausal interaction between created substances, he tends to accept the\ninflux analysis; he does not look around for a better analysis that\nwould preserve the truth of our ordinary causal statements\u201d\n(Jolley 1998, 595). So, on the whole, Leibniz does not take seriously other\nalternative accounts of intersubstantial causation.\n\nPerhaps because he thinks he already has an account that will work for\nhim\u2014the pre-established harmony\u2014Leibniz does not believe\nthat a plausible theory of causation need be intersubstantial in kind.\nIn other words, Leibniz does not face a problem so many of his\ncontemporaries face: his metaphysics\u2014unlike their\nown\u2014includes the necessary (and sufficient?) elements to sustain\na properly and purely intrasubstantial theory of causation; a\nLeibnizian created substance is self-sufficient (possessing an inner\nprinciple of change that explains all of its property-instances),\npermanently causally efficacious (acting does not diminish its power),\nand equipped with a complete concept that conforms to the complete\nconcepts of all other created substances (perceiving or representing\none and the same universe). Thus, it makes sense that Leibniz would\nnot feel compelled to defend intersubstantial causation. Like\nreference to miracles, it would be an unnecessary move, and therefore\nmethodologically invalid. \n\nThis point can be alternatively expressed. A difficult problem in\ngiving an account of intrasubstantial causation concerns the\nexplanation of the difference between causation among systems and\ncausation within a system. For instance, do the works of a watch\nconstitute an isolated system? For even Rolexes, constructed for\ndeep-sea divers, are affected at extreme temperatures and depths. So\nthere is a problem giving an account of causation within a Rolex. A\nsimilar problem arises for a seventeenth century philosopher who holds\na mechanistic and materialist notion of substance. But Leibniz has no\nproblem with explaining the difference between systems that are\ncausally isolated and systems that cannot be made absolute; his\nmonadic ontology is readily equipped to handle causally isolated units\nor unities. For his substances are \u201cwindowless,\u201d not at\nall causally compromised by external substances.\n\nThere is \u2026 no way in which it could make sense for a monad to\nbe altered or changed internally by any other created thing. Because\nthere is nothing to rearrange within a monad, and there is no\nconceivable internal motion in which it could be excited, directed,\nincreased, or diminished, in the way that it can in a composite, where\nthere is change among the parts. Monads have no windows, through which\nanything could come in or go out. And accidents cannot detach\nthemselves and stroll about outside of substances, as the\nScholastics\u2019 sensible species used to; so neither substance nor\naccident can come into a monad from outside. (Monadology\n\u00a77 GP vi, 608/WF 268)\n\n\nIn other words, Leibniz writes, \u201csubstances can never prevent\none another from performing those works in this universe as far as is\npossible\u201d (Letter to Arnauld April 30, 1687 \u00a76 WF 125).\n\nIn what follows, I will focus on Leibniz\u2019s positive account of\ncausation. The only real causation present in Leibniz\u2019s\nmetaphysics is that within each finite substance and that of God who\npre-establishes the harmony among minds and bodies (and minds and\nminds, and bodies and bodies). So the rest of this entry will address\nintrasubstantial and divine causation.\n",
