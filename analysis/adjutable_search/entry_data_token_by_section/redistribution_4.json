    "main_text": "The Baseline Distribution || .2 Moralized Subjunctive Baselines\n3. Conclusion\n\n\nThere are, no doubt, reasons for considering certain economic\nsystems just, and others unjust, but it has turned out to be difficult\nto use the concept of redistribution to mark out differences between\nthem. Redistribution in any of the three diachronic senses, and in\neither of the unmoralized synchronic senses appears to lack basic moral\nsignificance. Redistribution as tax and transfer or as rights\ninfringement may indeed have basic moral significance. The\nclassification of policies and institutional arrangements as\nredistributive in either of these senses, however, has been shown to\ndepend on our moral assessment of these practices, and cannot thus be\nused as a basis for such assessments.\n\n\nBut couching discussions of distributive justice in terms implied by\nredistribution smuggles in associations of forceful takings and rights\ninfringements, which are not obviously appropriate in the context of\nevaluating social programs funded through taxation, or to discussions\nof reforms of the global economy. Moreover, focusing on the\npermissibility of \u2018helping\u2019 and \u2018aiding\u2019 poorer\npeople through \u2018redistributive\u2019 transfers seems tacitly to\naccept the existing distribution of holdings as a morally unproblematic\nbenchmark. This focus will tend to privilege the status quo, and foster\nresistance to more egalitarian social arrangements.\n",
