    "main_text": "The Dynamical Approach\n4. The Dynamical Approach\n\nSince 2000, a new \u2018dynamical\u2019 approach to spacetime\nstructure has emerged in the works of Robert DiSalle (2006) and\nespecially Oliver Pooley and Harvey Brown (2001, 2006). This approach\nis to be situated against an opposing, supposedly orthodox\n\u2018geometrical\u2019 approach to spacetime structure, as\nencapsulated in the works of e.g. Janssen (2009) and Maudlin (2012).\n(This is not to say that either the dynamical view or the opposing\ngeometrical view is a unified edifice, as we will see below.) The\ndynamical-geometrical debate has many facets, but one can take the\ncentral bone of contention to pertain to the arrow of explanation: is\nit the case that the geometrical structures of spacetime explain why\nmaterial bodies behave as they do (as the geometrical view would have\nit), or is it rather the case that the geometrical structure of\nspacetime is explained by facts about the behaviour of material bodies\n(as the dynamical view would have it)? Although this debate connects\nwith historical debates between substantivalists and relationists, it\nshould be regarded as a distinct dispute, for reasons to which we will\ncome.\n\nWhile it is important to keep in mind the above disagreement regarding\nthe arrow of explanation when one is considering the\ndynamical-geometrical debate, it will be helpful in this article to\nhone in on two more specific claims of the dynamical approach, as\npresented by Brown (2005), consistent with the above claim that it is\nfacts about the dynamics of material bodies which explain facts about\nspatiotemporal structure, rather than vice versa. These two claims are\nthe following (Read 2020a):\n\nFixed background space-time structures, such as the Minkowski\nspace-time of STR, or Newton\u2019s absolute space, are to be\nontologically reduced to the symmetries of the dynamical equations\ngoverning matter fields.\nNo piece of space-time structure, whether fixed or dynamical (in\nthe latter case, as in GTR) is necessarily surveyed by physical\nbodies; rather, in order to ascertain whether this is so, one must\nattend carefully to the details of the dynamics governing the\nparticular matter fields which constitute physical bodies.\n\n\nOn the first of these two points: proponents of the dynamical approach\nmaintain that the spacetime structure of our world is what it is\nbecause of the dynamical laws of nature and their symmetries.\nThat is, the dynamical laws are (at least, relative to spacetime)\nfundamental, and spacetime structure is derivative; in this sense, the\nview is (at least in some cases) a modern-day form of relationism\n(Pooley 2013, \u00a76.3.2) \u2013 albeit of a very different kind\nfrom the relationist approaches considered up to this point. (Note,\nthough, that this relationism is a corollary of the above\nexplanatory contention of the dynamical approach; moreover, it is one\nwhich is applicable only to theories which fixed spacetime structure\nsuch as Newtonian mechanics or STR \u2013 and therefore not\nto theories with dynamical spacetime structure, such as GTR. For this\nreason, as already indicated above, proponents of the dynamical view\nare not to be identified na\u00efvely with relationists.)\n\nOn the second of these two points: the idea \u2013 what Butterfield\n(2007) calls \u2018Brown\u2019s moral\u2019 \u2013 is that one\ncannot simply posit a piece of geometrical structure in one\u2019s\ntheory, e.g. a Minkowski metric field in STR, and know ab\ninitio that material bodies (in particular rods and clocks) will\nread off intervals of that structure; rather, whether this is the case\nor not will depend upon the constitution of, and dynamics governing,\nthose material bodies. We will see below specific theories in which\nany such assumption seems to fail. Note that this second point is\nagain consistent with the explanatory contention taken above to be\ncharacteristic of the dynamical approach: a given piece of structure\ninherits its operational significance as spacetime by dint of the\nbehaviour of material bodies.\n\nBefore addressing the second of these two points, we should consider\nthe first in greater detail. The claim that fixed spatiotemporal\nstructure is to be ontologically reduced to facts about material\nbodies invites many questions, chief among which is perhaps the\nfollowing: to what could this ontological reduction possibly amount?\nIn the following section, we will see one particular metaphysical\nprogramme which promises to make good on this claim.\n",
