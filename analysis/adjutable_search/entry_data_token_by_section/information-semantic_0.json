    "main_text": "Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s Theory of Semantic Information\n1. Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s Theory of Semantic Information\n\nThe most natural starting point for any overview of semantic\nconceptions of information is Carnap and Bar-Hillel\u2019s \u201cAn\nOutline of a Theory of Semantic Information\u201d (1952). Bar Hillel\nand Carnap\u2019s theory of semantic information is a quantitative\ntheory that emerged from more general theories of information (see \nsection 4.2 on Shannon in the entry on\n information).\n Their theory was designed with the goal of giving us a usable\nframework for calculating the amount of semantic information\nencoded by a sentence in a particular language. In their case the\nlanguage in question is monadic predicate logic. The philosophical\ndetails are grounded on an idea that has come to be known as the\ninverse range principle (IRP). Loosely, IRP states that the\namount of information carried or encoded by a sentence is inversely\nproportional to something else, where this something else is something\nto which one can attach a precise numerical value. Once this has been\ndone, one can use this numerical value to calculate the measure of\nsemantic information as understood by the theory of semantic\ninformation.\n\nFor Bar-Hillel and Carnap, the amount of semantic information\nencoded by a sentence is inversely proportional to the likelihood of\nthe truth of that sentence. So for them, the likelihood of truth\nis the \u201csomething else\u201d to which we can attach a precise\nnumerical value. To illustrate, we start with their method of\ncalculating a qualitative individuation of semantic information,\ncontent or \u201cCont\u201d.\n\nWhere \\(s\\) is a sentence and \\(W\\) is\nthe set of all possible worlds, content is defined as follows:\n\\[\\tCont(s) := \\{x\\in W : x\\vdash \\neg s\\}\\]\n\nGiven that the intension of a sentence \\(s\\)\nis the set of all worlds in which the sentence if true, and\nthat the content of a sentence is the set of all worlds in which \\(s\\)\nis false, the intension and the content of a\nsentence \\(s\\) form a partition on the set of all\nworlds \\(W\\).\n\nBar-Hillel and Carnap define two distinct methods for\nquantitative calculations of semantic information\u2014a\ncontent measure (cont), and an information measure\n(inf). They start with an a priori probability measure of a\nsentence \\(s\\), \\(p(s)\\), which is gotten from an a\npriori distribution. The a priori distribution onto \\(W\\)\nsums to 1, and we assume that all assignments are\nequiprobable, hence the a priori probability measure is the\nvalue of \\(p(s)\\) that results from this distribution. In this case,\ncont and inf can be defined as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align} \\tcont(s) &:= 1 - p(s)\\\\ \\inf(s) &:= \\log_2\\frac{1}{1 - \\tcont(s)} \\end{align}\\]\n\nThe two measures are required for technical reasons\u2014in order to\ncapture additivity on content independence and inductive\nindependence respectively. Two sentences \\(s\\) and\n\\(s'\\) are content independent when they do not have any worlds in\ncommon. Two sentences \\(s\\) and \\(s'\\) are inductively\nindependent when the conditional probability of each sentence given\nthe other is identical to their initial unconditional probability.\nAdditivity on inductive independence fails for cont, since it might be\nthe case that \\(\\tcont(s\\wedge s') \\neq \\tcont(s) + \\tcont(s')\\) on\naccount of \\(p(s)\\) and \\(p(s')\\) having worlds in common\u2014that\nis, on account of them not being content independent in spite of their\nbeing inductively independent. For additivity to hold on cont, it is\ncontent independence, as opposed to inductive independence\nthat is required. By contrast, additivity on inductive independence\ndoes not fail for inf. Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s proof is\nnon-trivial (found on their 1952: 244\u20135).\n",
