    "main_text": "Mature Period\n3. Mature Period\n\nTsongkhapa formulated the philosophy for which he is best known some\nten years after finishing the Golden Garland. He\ncharacterized the vision that led him to his philosophy as a pristine\nMiddle Way. Reflecting back on his insight he would write in his\nIn Praise of Dependent Origination (brTen 'brel bstod\npa) (translation by Tupten Jinpa, undated)\n\n\n\u201cNonetheless, before the stream of this life\n\nFlowing towards death has come to cease\n\nThat I have found slight faith in you\u2014\n\nEven this I think is fortunate.\n\nAmong teachers, the teacher of dependent origination,\n\nAmongst wisdoms, the knowledge of dependent origination\u2014\n\nYou, who're most excellent like the kings in the worlds,\n\nKnow this perfectly well, not others.\u201d\n\n\nTsongkhapa first sets forth this mature philosophy linking dependent\norigination and emptiness in a special section at the end of his\nGreat Exposition. There, in the context of an investigation\ninto the end-product of an authentic, intellectual investigation into\nthe truly real (Sk. tattva, Tib. de kho na), and\ninto the way things finally are at their deepest level (Sk.\ntathat\u0101, Tib. de bzhin\n nyid),[2]\n he says you have to identify the object of negation (Tib. dgag\nbya), i.e., the last false projection to appear as reality, by\navoiding two errors: going too far (Tib. khyab che ba) and\nnot going far enough (Tib. khyab chung ba) (Drefus et al,\n2011, chapter 5).\n\nThat his project does not presuppose a privileged, soul-like, state of\nconsciousness that surveys and categorizes phenomena is evident from\nhis assertion that these two errors originate in a latent\npsychological tendency in philosophers: first, to hold on to vestiges\nof truth (reality) where there is in fact an absence of it, and\nsecond, to fall back on some version of truth (reality) in ordinary\nappearance after failing to avoid nihilism in a futile quest for\nmeaning.\n\nThis section of Tsongkhapa's work is based on the opening verse of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna's Root Verses on the Middle Way\n(M\u016bla-madhyamaka-k\u0101rik\u0101). Tsongkhapa's\nOcean of Reasoning (Garfield and Samten 2006) is a detailed\nexegesis of this work. In it, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna says nothing is\nproduced because it is not produced from itself, other, both or\nneither. In Tsongkhapa's Great Exposition, the subject of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna's syllogism is primarily the embodied person,\nreflecting the trend that runs throughout Buddhist philosophical\nliterature, in general, to stress the application of philosophical\nanalysis to praxis. Furthermore, for Tsongkhapa, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's\nstatement is about a first moment in the continuum of the\ninvestigating person. By implication, reflecting the continuing\ninfluence of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, it is the person engaged in\nthe philosophical investigation in the immediate moment. It is\naxiomatic for Buddhist philosophers that there is no independent\nsubject (soul) other than the five heaps (skandhas), so the\nsubject of the syllogism becomes the complex or continuum of\nsense-faculties in the present instant. Such a subject makes\nexcellence sense of Tsongkhapa's otherwise confusing juxtaposition of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna's analysis with Dharmak\u012brti's epistemology,\nin which it is axiomatic that direct sense perception is an\nauthoritative means of knowledge (Sk.\npram\u0101\u1e47a).\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna's statement that such a person was never produced\nseems paradoxical, to say the least, because it appears to undercut\nthe reality of the very intellectual act in which the thinker is\nself-evidently engaged. Tsongkhapa makes it abundantly clear that in\nhis view not only is the intellectual act itself utterly devoid of any\nessential reality, even the sense-faculties (the complex eye, ear and\nso on) also lack any essential reality, never mind the sense data they\nconvey to the knowing individual.\n\nTsongkhapa's choice of the opening line's of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's\nwork as a point of departure for his philosophy stems from his belief\nthat he has gained a true insight into dependent origination\n(prat\u012btya-samutp\u0101da). This insight, he believes,\nresolves the paradox between his apparent nihilism and his insistence\non the weight of authoritative statements and cognitions. Thus he says\nin his Great Exposition,\n\n\n\u201cTherefore, the intelligent should develop an unshakeable\ncertainty that the very meaning of emptiness is\ndependent-arising\u2026 Specifically, this is the subtle point\nthat the noble N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and his spiritual son \u0100ryadeva\nhad in mind and upon which the master Buddhap\u0101lita and the\nglorious Candrak\u012brti gave fully comprehensive commentary. This is\nhow dependent-arising bestows certain knowledge of the absence of\nintrinsic existence; this is how it dawns on you that it is things\nwhich are devoid of intrinsic existence that are causes and\neffects\u201d (Lamrim Chenmo Translation Committee Vol. 3, 139).\n\n\nTsongkhapa set out the ramifications of his view in \u201ceight\npoints that are difficult to understand\u201d (Tib. dka' gnas\nbrgyad) first enumerated in notes (rjes byang) to one of\nhis lectures by his contemporary and disciple, Darma rin chen (also\ncalled rGyal tshab rje \u201cthe regent\u201d). Tillemans\n(1998) has nicely rendered the opening of the text as follows,\n\n\n\u201cConcerning the [ontological] bases, there are the following\n[three points]: (1) the conventional nonacceptance of particulars and\nof (2) the storehouse consciousness, and (3) the acceptance of\nexternal objects. Concerning the path, there are the following [four\npoints]: (4) the nonacceptance of autonomous reasonings as being means\nfor understanding reality and (5) the nonacceptance of self-awareness;\n(6) the way in which the two obscurations exist; (7) how it is\naccepted that the Buddha's disciples and those who become awakened\nwithout a Buddha's help realize that things are without any\nown-nature. Concerning the result, there is: (8) the way in which the\nbuddhas know [conventional] things in their full extent.\nThus, there are four accepted theses and four unaccepted\ntheses.\u201d \n\n\nThey have been discussed by a number of writers (Ruegg 2002, Cabezon\n1992, 397, Cabezon and Dargyay 2006, 76-93, 114-201).\n\nI have surveyed Tsongkhapa's early work on the\n\u0101laya-vij\u00f1\u0101na (Tilleman's \u201cstorehouse\nconsciousness\u201d) above. For Tsongkhapa, until the correct view is\nunderstood, it is necessary to assert the\n\u0101laya-vij\u00f1\u0101na in order to save cause and\neffect, and avoid falling into nihilism. When the correct view is\nobtained, the \u0101laya-vij\u00f1\u0101na stands\ninvalidated (Tillemans's second point). For Tsongkhapa, it is only\npossible to understand cause and effect (in particular, as experienced\nin the immediate moment by an embodied person), by correctly\nunderstanding that dependent origination precludes any essential\nexistence whatsoever.\n\nTsongkhapa asserts that a specific mark (Sk.\nsva-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a), for instance a mark that makes blue\nblue, instead of red or any other color, has not even a nominal\nexistence. This is the first of Tillemans's eight difficult\npoints.\n\nIn his monograph Essence of Eloquence, Tsongkhapa employs a\nhermeneutics that treats language and knowledge as equally semiotic in\nnature. This is consistent with Tsongkhapa's view that any\nintellectual act is itself utterly devoid of any essential reality,\nyet functions on a conventional level through the natural workings of\ndependent origination (Sk. dharmat\u0101). This view allows\nhim to conclude that Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti's\nLogico-epistemological school is equivalent to Asa\u1e45ga's\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra school insofar as the former school asserts a\nspecific mark, seen by direct sense perception, that is necessary in\norder to retain the reality of the conventional world. Tsongkhapa\ntakes the strong position that no datum that appears to (or is there\nbut unknown to) thought or sense perception, has any essential\nreality. All are, equally, simply labeled by thought construction\n(Tib. rtog pas btags tsam). Only convention makes the actual\nsense-faculties, for example, real, and success or failure experienced\nin a dream, for example, false. This dependent origination (between a\nlabel and what is labeled) precludes the essential existence implicit\nin the Epistemologist's sva-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a.\n\nTsongkhapa's strong rejection of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra idealism leads him\nto assert the existence of external objects (the third point). His\n(discredited) Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school, based on either the works of\nAsa\u1e45ga or the Epistemologists, explains the absence of\nsubject-object bifurcation as non-dual with thought or mind (Sk.\ncitta). Realizing this in a non-conceptual, meditational\nstate constitutes a liberating vision. Ultimately, therefore, external\nobjects are projections of a deluded mind. Tsongkhapa rejects this,\nthough he suggests only those who have understood the emptiness of\ninherent existence through reflecting on the natural workings of\ndependent origination can set it aside. As he says in his Ocean of\nReasoning,\n\n\n\u201cThe meaning of the statement that the conventional designation\nof subject and objects stops is that the designation of these two\nstops from the perspective of meditative equipoise, but it does not\nmean that the insight in meditative equipoise and the ultimate truth\nare rejected as subject and object. This is because their being\nsubject and object is not posited from the perspective of analytic\ninsight, but from the perspective of conventional understanding\u201d\n(Garfield and Samten 2006, p. 26). \n\n\nFrom the perspective of ordinary convention there are external\nobjects, so it is sufficient, on that level, to assert that they are\nthere.\n\nTsongkhapa does not accept sv\u0101tantra\n(\u201cautonomous\u201d) reasoning (the fourth point). He asserts\nthat it is enough, when proving that any given subject is empty of\nintrinsic existence, to lead the interlocutor, through reasoning, to\nthe unwelcome consequences (prasa\u1e45ga) in their own\nuntenable position; it is not necessary to demonstrate the thesis\nbased on reasoning that presupposes any sort of intrinsic\n(=autonomous) existence. This gives Tsongkhapa's philosophy its name\n*Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika-madhyamaka, i.e., a philosophy of a middle way\n(between nihilism and eternalism) arrived at through demonstrating the\nunwelcome consequences (in any given position that presupposes\nintrinsic existence).\n\nIn the context of this assertion, Tsongkhapa offers a distinctive\nexplanation of the well-known Nay\u0101yika objection to\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna's philosophy, namely, if the statements he uses to\nprove his thesis are themselves without any final intrinsic reality,\nthey will be ineffective as proofs. Tsongkhapa says\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika-madhyamakas do not simply find faults in all\npositions and reject all positions as their own. They only deny any\nthesis that presupposes an intrinsic existence. They do hold a\nspecific thesis, to wit, that all phenomena lack an intrinsic\nexistence. They use reasoning and logic that lacks any essential\nreality to establish this thesis. Such reasoning derives its\nefficacity on a conventional level through the natural workings of\ndependent origination. This is one of the most contentious assertions\nof Tsongkhapa.\n\nTsongkhapa's rejection of any form of self-referential consciousness\n(Sk. sva-sa\u1e43vitti, sva-sa\u1e43vedana) (the\nfifth point) is in essence a rejection of\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita's position that such self-referential or\nreflexive awareness is necessary to explain the self-evidential nature\nof consciousness, and to explain the privileged access the conscious\nperson has to their own consciousness as immediate and veridical\n(Garfield\n 2006).[3]\n At issue is the status of the knowing subject engaged in the\nintellectual pursuit of the truly real. Tsongkhapa holds that such a\nknowing subject has no essential reality at all.\n\nSuch a position requires of Tsongkhapa an explanation of memory. His\nsolution is to deny that when you remember seeing object X\nyou also remember the conscious act of seeing it. (Were you to do so,\nthere would have to be an aspect of the earlier consciousness of the\nobject that was equally conscious of itself, i.e., self-referential.)\nInstead, Tsongkhapa argues, memory is simply the earlier consciousness\nof object X, now designated \u201cpast.\u201d When\ndesignated past, inexorably (or inferentially, as it were) the\npresence of a consciousness of the past object X is required\nto make sense of the present reality.\n\nTsongkhapa characterizes basic ignorance (Sk. avidy\u0101),\nthe root cause of suffering in Buddhist philosophy, not as a latent\ntendency, but as an active defiling agency (Sk.\nkle\u015b\u0101vara\u1e47a) that projects a reality onto\nobjects that is in fact absent from them. This ignorance affects even\nsense perception and explains the veridical aspect that is, in fact,\njust error. The residual impressions left by distortion (literally\n\u201cperfumings\u201d Sk. v\u0101san\u0101) explain the\nmere appearance of things as real. Beyond that, he asserts that\nhabituation to this distortion prevents conventional and ultimate\nreality from appearing united in an appearing object. This explanation\nof the psychology of error differs markedly from earlier Tibetan\nexplanations and constitutes the sixth difficult point.\n\nIn Tsongkhapa's mature philosophy the Mah\u0101y\u0101na altruistic\nprinciple (bodhicitta) is the sole criterion for\ndistinguishing authentic Mah\u0101y\u0101na views and practices from\nnon-Mah\u0101y\u0101na ones. By privileging the principle in this way\nhe is able to assert that any authentic realization of truth is a\nrealization of the way things are, namely, a realization of no\nsva-bh\u0101va (Sk.) (\u201cown-being, own-nature, intrinsic\nidentity\u201d). For Tsongkhapa, therefore, H\u012bnay\u0101nists (by\nwhich he intends followers of the basic Buddhist doctrine of the Four\nNoble Truths set forth in the earliest scriptures), necessarily have\nthe same authentic knowledge of reality. Were they not to have such\nknowledge, he argues, they could not have reached the goals they\nreached (the seventh point).\n\nFinally, Tsongkhapa has a robust explanation of the difference between\ntrue and false on the covering or conventional level. He denies any\ndifference between a false object (a dream lottery ticket, for\nexample) and a real one; as appearances, he asserts, both are equally\nfalse, only convention decides which is true. All phenomena equally\nlack truth. In Tsongkhapa's mature philosophy, therefore, all\nappearance is false\u2013\u2013to appear is to appear as being truly\nwhat the appearance is of, and the principle of dependent origination\nprecludes such truth from according with the way things actually\nare.\n\nTsongkhapa holds that sentences and their content and minds and what\nappears to them function in the same way. Saying (1) of a set of\n\u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d statements that they are\nall equally untrue, and (2) saying of unmediated sense-based\nperception or mistaken ideas that they are equally untrue is to say\nthe same thing. The truth in both is decided by convention, not by\nsomething inhering in the true statement (or its content), or the\nvalid perception (or its object). For Tsongkhapa, therefore, since all\nappearance is false, the Buddha knows, but without any appearance of\ntruth (the eighth difficult point).\n\nTowards the very end of his life, in his Medium-Length Exposition\nof the Path and Elucidation of the Intention Tsongkhapa\ndefends his views against Rongt\u00f6n's (rong stong shes bya kun\nrig) (1367-1449) criticism that his earlier and later works are\ninconsistent. Tsongkhapa extends his comparison of Candrak\u012brti's\nand Bh\u0101viveka's interpretations of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna to more\nclearly identify a less subtle object of negation in the works of\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra-sv\u0101tantrika-madhyamaka writers, particularly\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha (8th century) and \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\n(Hopkins 2008, Part One, Yi 2015). Tsongkhapa finds in their works an\nanalysis leading beyond the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra's mere absence of a\nsubstantial difference between known object and knowing subject, but\nlimited insofar as it negates the ultimate truth of all objects\nappearing to conventional awareness while still allowing room for an\nobject of negation that does not appear to sense perception. \n\nDreyfus et al (2011) and Falls (2010) suggest parallels between the\nissues raised by the Sv\u0101tantrika\u2013Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\ndifference and some recent work in Western philosophy. They are\nhelpful for those familar with Western philosophy but unfamiliar with\nTsongkhapa, surveying questions that arise from the interaction of\nphilosophical traditions from different cultures. Falls argues\nTsongkhapa's philosophy is a therapeutea not a theoria and draws\nparallels between issues raised by Tsongkhapa and John McDowell's\ninterpretation of Wilfrid Sellars in particular. \n",
