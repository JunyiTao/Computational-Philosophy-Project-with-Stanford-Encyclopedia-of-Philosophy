    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard was born to Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard and\nAnne (Lund) Kierkegaard in Copenhagen on 5 May 1813, the youngest of\nseven children. He spent most of his life in and around the Danish\ncapital, traveling abroad on only a handful of occasions (mostly to\nBerlin, including to hear Schelling\u2019s lectures).\nKierkegaard\u2019s father, who had been born to a poor family in\nJutland, had become wealthy as a merchant in Copenhagen. Michael was\ndevoutly religious, and young S\u00f8ren was brought up as a\nLutheran but was also shaped by a Moravian congregation in which his\nfather played a prominent role. Kierkegaard was in turn deeply\ninfluenced by his father, about whose \u201cmelancholy\u201d much\nhas been written. One alleged cause of this, much speculated upon,\nconcerns the story that Kierkegaard\u2019s father believed he and his\nfamily to have been living under a curse because of his having cursed\nGod as a cold and hungry child.\n\nAfter a prolonged period of study at the University of Copenhagen,\nS\u00f8ren received a first degree in theology and a\nMagister degree in philosophy, with a dissertation dealing\nwith irony as practiced by Socrates (On the Concept of Irony with\nContinual Reference to Socrates). The Magister degree\nwas the equivalent of a contemporary doctorate, the title being\nchanged to \u201cdoctor\u201d some years later. He then completed\nthe pastoral seminary program that qualified him to become a priest in\nthe Lutheran state church. However, Kierkegaard was never ordained and\nnever became a pastor, though he preached on occasions in various\nCopenhagen churches.\n\nIn 1840 Kierkegaard became engaged to the eighteen-year-old Regine\nOlsen. He quickly came to believe that he had made a terrible mistake\nand that he could not marry her. His reasons are not fully known but\nhave been the subject of a great deal of speculation, much of it bound\nup with Kierkegaard\u2019s own \u201cmelancholy\u201d and\nrelationship to his by then deceased father. In the letter returning\nher ring, Kierkegaard asks Regine to forgive him, the one who\n\u201cwhatever else he was capable of could not make a girl\nhappy\u201d (cited in Hannay 2001: 155). In his journals, he expands\non this, reflecting several years later that within six months of\nmarriage to him she would have \u201cgone to pieces\u201d, as there\nwas \u201csomething spectral about me\u201d, which would make a\n\u201creal relationship\u201d with him impossible (PJ 421\u20132).\nRegine vigorously opposed ending the engagement. After fruitlessly\nseeking to change her mind, S\u00f8ren embarked on a misguided (and\nunsuccessful) scheme to free her from attachment to him by pretending\nto be a scoundrel who had trifled with her affections. Finally, in\n1841 he broke the engagement for good and fled to Berlin for a brief\ntime, perhaps in part to escape the public scandal of the whole\naffair. Kierkegaard remained unmarried for the rest of his life, his\nwill bequeathing to Regine what remained of his worldly goods, to make\nthe point that to him the engagement was just as binding as a\nmarriage. Regine\u2014or rather, her husband on her\nbehalf\u2014declined to accept the bequest, except for a few personal\nitems that Regine wanted.\n\nThe period following the end of the engagement was one of the most\nproductive of Kierkegaard\u2019s authorship. Work on the text that he\nconsidered properly to begin his authorship, Either/Or, began\nalmost as soon as he arrived in Berlin, and it was published in 1843.\nBetween that year and 1846, several other works appeared: Fear and\nTrembling (1843), Repetition (1843), Philosophical\nFragments (1844), The Concept of Anxiety (1844), several\ncollections of Upbuilding Discourses (1843, 1844),\nPrefaces (1844), Three Discourses on Imagined\nOccasions (1845), Stages on Life\u2019s Way (1845),\nConcluding Unscientific Postscript (1846), and A Literary\nReview, better known in English as Two Ages (1846).\n\nIt is clear enough that some of Kierkegaard\u2019s early writings\ncontained disguised communications to Regine, who soon married another\nman (Johan Frederik Schlegel, later Governor-General of the Danish\nWest Indies), which meant that Kierkegaard could not communicate\ndirectly with her. He hoped she might come to realize that he still\nloved her, but also understand why he could not go through with the\nmarriage. Biographies of Kierkegaard often focus on the broken\nengagement in detail, and commentators have sometimes gone to great\nlengths to find \u201cmessages to Regine\u201d in\nKierkegaard\u2019s texts, some more plausible than others. However,\nRegine was far from the only person who could be described as\n\u201cthat individual\u201d to whom Kierkegaard dedicated many of\nhis works.\n\nTwo other biographical episodes are worth mentioning. First, in\n1845\u20136 Kierkegaard became embroiled in a controversy with\nThe Corsair, a satirical literary magazine that included\ncartoons mocking many of Denmark\u2019s most prominent public\nfigures. Initially Kierkegaard was spared this treatment, and indeed\nwas on friendly terms with Meir Goldschmidt, a Jewish intellectual who\nwas the magazine\u2019s editor. However, after Kierkegaard (in the\npersona of one of his pseudonyms) goaded the magazine by attacking P.\nL. M\u00f8ller, an aspiring scholar who wrote for The\nCorsair, Kierkegaard became the object of a series of nasty\nattacks, which included mocking his personal appearance. This might\nseem inconsequential, but all the main figures involved had their\nlives dramatically changed. S\u00f8ren, whose chief recreational\noccupation had been daily walks around Copenhagen, in which he\nconversed with many people, taking what he called \u201cpeople\nbaths\u201d, became reclusive, unable to endure the curious and\nsometimes jeering groups of people who stared at him. As a result, he\ngave up the idea of becoming a pastor, feeling a call to \u201cremain\nat his post\u201d as an author. Following the \u201cCorsair\naffair\u201d, Kierkegaard\u2014who had intended the Concluding\nUnscientific Postscript to bring his authorship to an\nend\u2014embarked upon a second, highly productive period of writing,\nthe fruits of which include Upbuilding Discourses in Various\nSpirits (1847), Works of Love (1847), Christian\nDiscourses (1848), The Sickness Unto Death (1849),\nPractice in Christianity (1850) and several more discourses\n(for the full list, see the Chronology below).\n\nSecond, in the last two years of his life, Kierkegaard, known as a\ndefender of Christian faith, embarked on a controversial attack on the\nDanish state church, a target that symbolized all that he thought was\nwrong with \u201cChristendom\u201d as a whole. The attack on the\nChurch was made in the name of \u201cNew Testament\nChristianity\u201d, which Kierkegaard thought the Church had\nbetrayed. The war was waged in newspapers and in a pamphlet\n(\u00d8jeblikket, variously translated as The\nMoment or The Instant) that Kierkegaard himself founded\nand for which he wrote ten issues. These writings are markedly\ndifferent from the rest of his work. Obviously intended for a broad\naudience, they employed searing wit and satire, making no attempt to\nbe subtle or nuanced. Amid this public battle, Kierkegaard collapsed\non the street, paralyzed, and was taken to hospital. He died there a\nfew weeks later, on 11 November 1855. A tentative diagnosis of the\ncause was tuberculosis of the spine marrow. Towards the end,\nKierkegaard affirmed to Emil Boesen\u2014a lifelong friend and a\npriest in the church that Kierkegaard had attacked\u2014that he was\nstill a believer in Christ.\n\nKierkegaard\u2019s biographers paint dramatically different pictures\nof these events. Walter Lowrie\u2019s early biography (Lowrie 1938)\nis a work of loving devotion, as Lowrie spent a great deal of his\nlater life translating Kierkegaard into English. Joakim Garff\u2019s\nportrait (2000, English translation 2005) is far more critical and\nprovides unflattering interpretations of many of the key events in\nKierkegaard\u2019s life. The biographies by Alastair Hannay (2001),\nStephen Backhouse (2016), and Clare Carlisle (2019) all fall somewhere\nin between these two extremes.\n\nAlthough Kierkegaard died aged only 42, his writings are vast. One\naspect of these writings likely to strike those encountering him for\nthe first time as peculiar is the fact that\u2014aside from the\n\u201cattack upon Christendom\u201d writings of the final years and\na voluminous body of journal and notebook entries\u2014the authorship\ndivides broadly into two distinct kinds of text: those written under a\nvariety of pseudonyms (the \u201cpseudonymous\u201d authorship) and\nthose written under his own name (the \u201csigned\u201d or\n\u201cveronymous\u201d authorship). Several of the pseudonymous\nauthors, some of whose names are significant, represent different\nlife-views, such as the contrast between the \u201caesthetic\u201d\nand \u201cethical\u201d lives sketched through the multiple voices\nof Either/Or (more of which below). Others represent figures\nwho explore the life of faith from perspectives outside Christianity\n(such as Johannes de silentio, the author of Fear and\nTrembling) and Johannes Climacus (a self-described\n\u201chumorist\u201d whose two books, Philosophical\nFragments and its Concluding Unscientific Postscript,\nare written from a standpoint that falls short of the paradoxical\n\u201cReligiousness B\u201d that represents Christianity in the\nlatter work). One way of characterizing this pseudonymous authorship\nis to think of it as one vast novel, with the various pseudonymous\nauthors who figure in the works being characters therein. Although\nsome (e.g., Mackey 1986) have claimed that \u201cS.\nKierkegaard\u201d is ultimately just another pseudonym, this remains\na minority view.\n\nAmongst the signed literature, there are different types of texts,\nsuch as \u201cupbuilding\u201d or \u201cedifying\u201d discourses\n(Taler: speeches; talks); \u201cdeliberations;\u201d\n(Overveielser) and reviews. In the early 1840s, Kierkegaard\noften published a collection of such discourses at the same time as a\npseudonymous work, describing them as offered with the right and left\nhand respectively. Scholars have sometimes distinguished these earlier\nreligious discourses from later, explicitly Christian discourses,\nwhich latter group would include one of the most important works of\nKierkegaard\u2019s mature ethics, Works of Love.\nTechnically, the essays about Christian love that make up that text\nconsist not of \u201cdiscourses\u201d (Taler) but\n\u201cdeliberations\u201d (Overveielser). According to\nKierkegaard\u2019s own explanation of the distinction in his\njournals, whereas an upbuilding \u201cdiscourse\u201d presupposes\nthat people know what, say, love is and aims to win them over to it, a\n\u201cdeliberation\u201d must first unsettle a comfortable way of\nthinking, and so also aims to awaken; provoke; and sharpen thought. As\nnoted, in addition to his published works Kierkegaard kept extensive\njournals and notebooks, clearly expecting\u2014correctly\u2014that\nthese too would eventually be published.\n\nThe use of pseudonyms gives the reader the additional\u2014some would\nsay prior\u2014task of wondering where Kierkegaard stands in all\nthis. One figure with a peculiar status amongst the pseudonyms is\nAnti-Climacus, the only pseudonym other than Johannes Climacus to\nauthor more than one book (The Sickness Unto Death and\nPractice in Christianity). Many scholars have treated\nAnti-Climacus as only \u201cweakly\u201d pseudonymous, taking him to\narticulate views Kierkegaard himself holds, but which he considers\nhimself to lack the authority to pronounce in his own name. In this\nsense, Anti-Climacus has often been read as the \u201chighest\u201d\nKierkegaardian voice.\n\nSome strategies have been defended as giving a window into\nKierkegaard\u2019s own views in relation to the pseudonyms. One is to\nlook for common themes and conceptual perspectives that are shared by\nmost or (in some cases) nearly all the pseudonyms, such as the view\nthat there are distinct \u201cstages\u201d or \u201cspheres\u201d\nof existence (to be discussed below). It is reasonable to see these\ncommon elements as distinctively \u201cKierkegaardian\u201d. Another\nstrategy is to compare the pseudonymous works to the signed works, on\nthe assumption that the latter provide a baseline because they embody\nwhat Kierkegaard wanted to put forward under his own name. This\nsometimes makes it possible to have some idea of what Kierkegaard\nhimself thought of the pseudonyms. Some, such as Johannes Climacus,\nseem closer to Kierkegaard than others, such as Judge William and the\nSeducer in Either/Or. Part of the evidence for this is that\nKierkegaard inserted his own name on the title page as editor of the\ntwo Climacus books, describing this as a \u201chint\u201d for those\nwho care about such things.\n\nIt certainly seems rash to attribute all the things said by the\npseudonyms to Kierkegaard, especially since Kierkegaard himself\nexplicitly requested that anyone citing these works should make the\nattribution to the pseudonyms rather than himself (CUP I 627/SKS 7,\n571). On the other hand, even if the pseudonyms had been actual\nindividuals distinct from Kierkegaard, it would not follow that they\nnever say things he would agree with, and it seems reasonable to think\nthat Kierkegaard had some ends of his own that he seeks to accomplish\nby the creation of the pseudonyms.\n\nWhat were those ends? In The Point of View for My Work as an\nAuthor (written 1848, published posthumously)\nKierkegaard\u2014in his own voice\u2014claims that he was from first\nto last a religious author, and thus that the pseudonymous works also\nserve religious ends, despite the fact that many of those works are\nnot explicitly religious in character. This claim has been hotly\ncontested, with some critics arguing that The Point of View\nrepresents what Kierkegaard later wanted his readers to think rather\nthan being an honest account of his intentions\u2014and that other\nelements of his writings, such as the journals, are similarly\nunreliable (see, e.g., Fenger 1976 [1980], Mackey 1986, Garff 2000\n[2005]). Interestingly, Kierkegaard seems in part to concede his\ncritics\u2019 point, since he admits that the unity he sees in the\nauthorship was not one he had in mind from the beginning, but rather\none that he came to understand as the authorship developed. In any\ncase, Kierkegaard agrees that an author\u2019s assertions about his\nwork should not always be taken at face value, and he asks his readers\nto discern for themselves whether the unity he claims to be present\nhelps to make sense of the whole. A rough characterization of the\nunity Kierkegaard himself sees could be summarized as follows:\nKierkegaard believes that genuine religious faith requires\n\u201cinwardness\u201d or \u201csubjectivity\u201d as its\npresupposition. The pseudonymous works, including those not explicitly\nreligious, can be seen as intended \u201cindirectly\u201d to\nencourage readers to \u201cbecome subjective\u201d, thus providing a\nbetter possibility of an understanding of religious existence. One\npiece of evidence Kierkegaard brings forward in support of the\nreligious character of the writings is the fact that the early\npseudonymous works were always \u201caccompanied\u201d by signed\nreligious works. Thus, one cannot reasonably claim that the religious\nis something that only emerges relatively late in the course of his\nauthorship.\n\nOne can therefore understand why, at least in retrospect, Kierkegaard\nsaw the whole of his authorship, including the pseudonymous works, as\ndevoted to the cause of \u201creintroducing Christianity into\nChristendom\u201d, one of the characteristic ways he describes the\ngoal of his writings. This phrase captures both the idea that\nKierkegaard saw himself as a defender of \u201cNew Testament\nChristianity\u201d and the way he saw himself as a critic of the\n\u201ccultural Christianity\u201d found in Denmark at the time,\nwhich assumed that virtually every Dane was a Christian and\nthus\u2014Kierkegaard thought\u2014conflated even lukewarm\n\u201cnominal\u201d Christianity with genuine faith.\nKierkegaard\u2019s critique of \u201cChristendom\u201d led to\ntensions with his older brother, Peter Christian Kierkegaard, who was\na follower of N. F. S. Grundtvig, a hugely influential Danish pastor\nand author who had, in S\u00f8ren\u2019s eyes, blended Scandinavian\nculture and Christian faith in a way that was detrimental to the\nlatter.\n\nOne interesting feature of Kierkegaard\u2019s reception is that,\ndespite his own Christian motivations, the writings have often had a\nhuge influence on non-Christian thinkers, who have found inspiration\nin elements of his thought\u2014such as the analysis of human\nexistence (see\n section 2\n below)\u2014that can be detached from Kierkegaard\u2019s own\nreligious framework. These would include such figures as Heidegger and\nthe Swiss psychiatrist and pioneer of existential psychotherapy,\nLudwig Binswanger, who judged The Sickness Unto Death as a\ntext which more than any other had the potential to \u201cadvance the\nexistential-analytic interpretation of schizophrenia\u201d\n(Binswanger 1958: 297; cf. also Laing 1960). It is also intriguing\nthat Kierkegaard was translated into Japanese before he was translated\ninto English (albeit initially via German rather than directly from\nDanish). The influence of Kierkegaard is clear in later Japanese\nthinkers such as Kitaro Nishida\u2019s attempt to create a synthesis\nbetween eastern Buddhist thought and European philosophy. (On\nKierkegaard in Japan, see Otani 1957 [2011], Mortensen 1996, Giles\n2008; for Kierkegaard\u2019s reception in other non-western\nEuropean/north American contexts, see Stewart 2007\u201317, Vol. 8\nTome III.) In some ways this breadth of reception is not surprising\nsince the \u201cinwardness\u201d Kierkegaard sought to cultivate is\nhuman inwardness, and many of his analyses and descriptions do not\npresuppose any dogmatic foundations.\n\nOne theme that can be found in both the pseudonymous and signed\nwritings is the distinction between direct and indirect communication.\nKierkegaard consistently maintains that ethical and religious truth\ncannot be directly or \u201cimmediately\u201d communicated to\nothers. Understanding such truths requires a \u201cdouble\nreflection\u201d. Since they are truths that pertain essentially to\nexistence or how life should be lived, it is possible to have a purely\nverbal or conceptual understanding of such truths that is nonetheless\na misunderstanding. To successfully grasp such communications, the\nrecipient must not only understand the sentences communicated, but\nmust think through what it would mean to embody or\n\u201creduplicate\u201d those ideals in existence. Kierkegaard\nthinks that the communicator must keep this in mind and artistically\nattempt to communicate in a manner that will discourage purely verbal\nunderstanding and encourage appropriation. The use of the pseudonyms\nis in part an attempt to do this. Rather than simply tell us in a\ndidactic manner about the various forms human existence can take, such\nas the aesthetic, ethical, and religious lives, the pseudonyms embody\nthese various ways of understanding human life. Kierkegaard hopes that\nreaders who engage with the pseudonymous characters might come to\nunderstand their own lives better, in much the same way as\nencountering the characters in a great novel can foster greater\nself-understanding, whether one sees oneself as like those characters\nor as very different from them. There is thus a strong novelistic or\n\u201cpoetic\u201d character to the pseudonymous authorship, and it\nseems right to pay attention to the literary form of\nKierkegaard\u2019s work, just as Plato scholars often pay close\nattention to the literary form of Plato\u2019s dialogues.\n",
