For example, if you can infer p from p\nand q, then you can also infer m from m and\nn. The systematicity of thinking requires explanation. Why is it\nthat thinkers who can infer p from p and\nq can also infer m from m and\nn?\n\nRTT+COMP+CCTM gives a compelling explanation. During an inference from\np and q to p, you transit from believing* mental\nsentence \\(S_1 \\amp S_2\\) (which means that p and q) to\nbelieving* mental sentence \\(S_{1}\\) (which means that p).\nAccording to CCTM, the transition involves symbol manipulation. A\nmechanical operation detaches the conjunct \\(S_{1}\\) from the\nconjunction \\(S_1 \\amp S_2\\). The same mechanical operation is\napplicable to a conjunction \\(S_{3} \\amp S_{4}\\) (which means that\nm and n), corresponding to the inference from m and\nn to n. An ability to execute the first inference entails\nan ability to execute the second, because drawing the inference in\neither case corresponds to executing a single uniform mechanical\noperation. More generally, logical inference deploys mechanical\noperations over structured symbols, and the mechanical operation\ncorresponding to a given inference pattern (e.g., conjunction\nintroduction, disjunction elimination, etc.) is applicable to any\npremises with the right logical structure. The uniform applicability\nof a single mechanical operation across diverse symbols explains\ninferential systematicity. Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) conclude that\ninferential systematicity provides reason to accept RTT+COMP+CCTM.\n\nFodor and Pylyshyn (1988) endorse an additional thesis about the\nmechanical operations corresponding to logical transitions. In keeping\nwith FSC, they claim that the operations are sensitive to formal\nsyntactic properties but not semantic properties. For example,\nconjunction elimination responds to Mentalese conjunction as a piece\nof pure formal syntax, much as a computer manipulates items in a\nformal language without considering what those items mean.\n\nSemantic computationalists reject FSC. They claim that mental\ncomputation is sometimes sensitive to semantic properties. Semantic\ncomputationalists can agree that drawing an inference involves\nexecuting a mechanical operation over structured symbols, and they can\nagree that the same mechanical operation uniformly applies to any\npremises with appropriate logical structure. So they can still explain\ninferential systematicity. However, they can also say that the\npostulated mechanical operation is sensitive to semantic properties.\nFor example, they can say that conjunction elimination is sensitive to\nthe meaning of Mentalese conjunction.\n\nIn assessing the debate between FSC and semantic computationalism, one\nmust distinguish between logical versus non-logical\nsymbols. For present purposes, it is common ground that the meanings\nof non-logical symbols do not inform logical inference. The\ninference from \\(S_1 \\amp S_2\\) to \\(S_{1}\\) features the same\nmechanical operation as the inference from \\(S_{3} \\amp S_{4}\\) to\n\\(S_{4}\\), and this mechanical operation is not sensitive to the\nmeanings of the conjuncts \\(S_{1}\\), \\(S_{2}\\), \\(S_{3}\\), or\n\\(S_{4}\\). It does not follow that the mechanical operation is\ninsensitive to the meaning of Mentalese conjunction. The meaning of\nconjunction might influence how the logical inference proceeds, even\nthough the meanings of the conjuncts do not.\n",
