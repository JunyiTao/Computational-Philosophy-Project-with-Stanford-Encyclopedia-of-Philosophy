    "main_text": "The Ontology of Nonexistence (abh\u0101va) and the Semantics of Negative Statements || Temporally and Spatially Located Absence\n11.3 The Logic of Negation\n\nThe Manual of Reason (TS 89) makes some very interesting\nobservations about the logical properties of absence or negation.\n\nReference versus description. It is claimed that\nthere is a distinction between a qualified absence\n(vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101bh\u0101va) and a mere absence\n(keval\u0101bh\u0101va). Consider the following pair of\nsentences:\n\nAnnambha\u1e6d\u1e6da is not in the room, and\nThe author of The Manual of Reason is not in the\nroom.\n\n\nThe idea is that in (3) the \u2018mere\u2019 absence of\nAnnambha\u1e6d\u1e6da is located in the room, whereas in (4) a\nqualified absence (of Annambha\u1e6d\u1e6da as qualified by\nauthorhood) is located in the room. Do (3) and (4) really have\ndistinct logical forms? Perhaps we find here a realisation that\nnominal expressions such as \u201cThe author of The Manual of\nReason\u201d have two distinct logical functions, namely those\nof referring to an individual and describing an\nindividual via his properties. (4) can thus be read either as\nasserting the same as (3), that Annambha\u1e6d\u1e6da is not in the\nroom, or as saying that the author of The Manual of Reason,\nwhoever it or she is, is not in the room, i.e. that the properties\n\u201cbeing the author of The Manual of Reason\u201d and\n\u201cbeing in the room\u201d are not collocated. If that is the\nsense in which (4) involves a qualified absence, then (3) and (4) do\nhave different logical forms.\n\nUniversal Quantification. The Manual of\nReason draws another very important distinction, between a\nspecific absence (vi\u015be\u1e63\u0101bh\u0101va) and a\ngeneric absence (s\u0101m\u0101ny\u0101bh\u0101va). These are\nillustrated by the following sentences:\n\n(This) pot is not in the room, and\n(Any) pot is not in the room\n\n\n(N.B. they would be expressed by the same sentence in Sanskrit; hence\nthe brackets). To say that there is a specific absence of pot in the\nroom is to say that some particular pot is not in the room, but to say\nthat generic absence of pot in the room is to say that any pot is not\nin the room (i.e. no pot is in the room). The distinction is thus\nlinked to the formulation of universally quantified constructions.\nIndeed, in Ny\u0101ya logical theory, generic absences are used to\nformulate the pervasion (vy\u0101pti) relation: \u201cwhere\nthere is smoke there is fire\u201d is contraposed to give\n\u201cwhere there is no fire there is no smoke\u201d, and this is\nexpressed by saying that there is a generic absence of smoke in places\nwhere there is a generic absence of fire (cf. Ingalls 1951:\n54\u20135). It is clear that (5) and (6) do have distinct logical\nforms. In the Ny\u0101ya technical language, the distinction is made\nout by saying that the property which delimits the counterpositiveness\nof the absence (i.e. the pratiyogit\u0101vacchedaka) is\nthis-pot-hood in (5), but pothood in (6).\n\nLogical Connectives and De Morgan\u2019s Laws.\nThe Manual of Reason touches on the meaning of conjunctive\nand disjunctive absence, i.e. absence of (both A and\nB) (ubhay\u0101bh\u0101va) and absence of (either\nA or B) (anyatar\u0101bh\u0101va). It\nobserves that an awareness that two pots are absent is consistent with\nan awareness that one pot is present (and the other absent). In fact,\nas Ingalls shows (1951: 63\u201367) the Ny\u0101ya recognised the\nvalidity of two general equations:\n\n\nabsence of (both A and B) = (absence of A)\nor (absence of B), and\n\nabsence of (either A or B) = (absence of A)\nand (absence of B).\n\n\nThese are recognisably versions of De Morgan\u2019s Laws, that\n\u00ac(A & B) \u2261 \u00acA \u2228\n\u00acB, and that \n\u00ac (A\u2228B) \u2261 \u00acA & \u00acB. \nAs an example of the second of\nthese laws, consider Mathuran\u0101tha\u2019s remark (1951: 66) that\na \u2018heap\u2019 of (specific) absences\n(abh\u0101va-k\u016b\u1e6da) is equivalent to a generic\nabsence. A place which is the locus of generic absence of fire is a\nplace at which every particular fire is absent, and conversely, if\nevery specific fire is absent, then fire is generically absent. Thus\nthe \u2018heap\u2019 (conjunction) of specific absences of fire, is\nequivalent to the absence of any fire at all (the disjunction of\nspecific fires).\n",
