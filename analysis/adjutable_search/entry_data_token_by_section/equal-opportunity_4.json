    "main_text": "Substantive Equality of Opportunity\n5. Substantive Equality of Opportunity\n\nThe meritocratic conception above is a relatively formal view of\nEquality of Opportunity. It holds that persons enjoy equal\nopportunities in the relevant sense provided they are not obstructed\nby legal or certain technical obstacles or by some forms of\ndiscrimination, and that under such conditions persons should compete\nfor positions under a process designed to select the best qualified.\nIn one sense, the meritocratic conception is quite a strict one\nconcerning the factors which are allowed to determine who successfully\ntakes advantage of their opportunities, in that, under the \u201cbest\nqualified\u201d criteria, only qualities appropriate to the position\nor good rightly determine the outcome of competitive applications.\nHowever, the meritocratic conception remains relatively formal in that\nit does not take into account broader obstacles to getting qualified\n(or, indeed, which qualifications ought to be rewarded) and so does\nnot take into account a wider range of factors which might have a\nsubstantial bearing on persons\u2019 chances to successfully compete\nfor social advantages (B. Barry 2005: ch.8)\n\nA famous illustration of this concern is given by Bernard Williams,\nwho offers the example of a society in which great prestige is\nattached to membership in a certain warrior class (Williams 1962\n[1973]).  Historically, members of the class were recruited from the\nwealthy class in society only, but reforms have resulted in the\ncompetition for membership now becoming open to all members in\nsociety. Under the terms of the competition the warriors are selected\nbased on their physical strength. Although the competition for\nselection is now an open one, it transpires that warriors are still\nonly selected from the wealthy class in society because the population\nin other social classes is so under-nourished that they lack the\nphysical strength to successfully compete for warrior status. It might\nbe argued that meaningful Equality of Opportunity for membership in\nthe warrior class has not really been achieved because the means to\ncompete on relevantly equal terms are denied to some\ncompetitors\u2014those from poorer social classes lack a realistic\nprospect for successfully satisfying the criteria for selection, in\nthis case physical strength.  One response here might be to argue that\nEquality of Opportunity\nis satisfied because those from poorer social classes are not\nbeing excluded because they are poor, but simply because they\nare physically weaker, which is a relevant criterion for selection to\nthe warrior class. In reply, it might be argued that this would amount\nto a merely formal and insubstantial way of thinking about Equality of\nOpportunity, given that those from the poorer social classes are\neffectively excluded, even if they are not explicitly barred (see\nWilliams 1962 [1973: 244\u2013245]).\n\nFor this reason, it might be thought that Equality of Opportunity\nrequires that people enjoy the substantive means to take advantage of\nthe formal opportunities available to them through open competition.\nViews which take this line can be broadly categorized as\nsubstantive conceptions of Equality of Opportunity. As with\ndifferent formal conceptions of Equality of Opportunity, substantive\nconceptions differ with respect to the way in which the opportunities\nshould be substantive.\n\nSuppose we complicate slightly Williams\u2019 warrior society example\nand say that warrior selection is based on physical strength, agility,\nand sword skills. Suppose that adequate nutrition is necessary for\nphysical strength, and sufficient physical strength is in turn\nrequired to develop the right agility and wield the heavy sword that\nthe warriors use. One substantive view might hold that Equality of\nOpportunity is secured when, and only when, citizens from all social\nclasses enjoy adequate nutrition. All citizens then have some\nrealistic prospect of developing the physical strength which is\nnecessary to procuring the further qualities that enable them to\nmeaningfully compete for warrior positions. However, suppose further\nthat the schools to which members of the wealthy class send their\nchildren offer agility training and sword skills classes as part of\nthe curriculum, whereas children from poorer classes go to schools\nwithout these lessons. It might be argued that although children have\nnutrition sufficient to give them some degree of meaningful\ncompetition, they do not have a relevantly equal prospects, given the\nother educational disadvantages they face relative to others. These\neducational inequalities might be countered by instituting an outreach\nprogram which rolls out the same forms of training in education to all\nother schools in less wealthy parts of the society.\n\nOne might take the view that this would now be sufficient to create\nthe conditions for Equality of Opportunity, given that these\neducational inequalities across different social classes have been\naddressed. The elimination of those educational inequalities is likely\nto result in increased competition for selection to the warrior class,\ngiven that a larger pool of children possess a more meaningful\nprospect of developing the necessary qualities. As a consequence,\nsuppose that wealthy families begin investing in private sword skill\ntuition for their children and that the tuition is far too expensive\nfor parents in poorer social classes to afford. If this tuition gives\nchildren from wealthy social classes a competitive advantage, it might\nbe argued that this undermines Equality of Opportunity, given that\nopportunities for children to successfully enter the warrior class are\nnot relevantly equal. It should be clear from this, then, that\ndifferent substantive views can be distinguished depending on the\nrange of factors they identify as those which undermine Equality of\nOpportunity.\n",
