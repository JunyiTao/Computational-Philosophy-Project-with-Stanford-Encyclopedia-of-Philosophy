    "main_text": "Large cardinals || Consequences of large cardinals\n10.2 Consequences of large cardinals\n\nThe existence of large cardinals has dramatic consequences, even for\nsimply-definable small sets, like the projective sets of real numbers.\nFor example, Solovay (1970) proved, assuming that there exists a\nmeasurable cardinal, that all \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^1_2\\) sets of reals\nare Lebesgue measurable and have the Baire property, which cannot be\nproved in ZFC alone. And Shelah and Woodin (1990) showed that the\nexistence of a proper class of Woodin cardinals implies that the\ntheory of \\(L(\\mathbb{R})\\), even with real numbers as parameters,\ncannot be changed by forcing, which implies that all sets of real\nnumbers that belong to \\(L(\\mathbb{R})\\) are regular. Further, under a\nweaker large-cardinal hypothesis, namely the existence of infinitely\nmany Woodin cardinals, Martin and Steel (1989) proved that every\nprojective set of real numbers is determined, i.e., the axiom of PD\nholds, hence all projective sets are regular. Moreover, Woodin showed\nthat the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals, plus a\nmeasurable cardinal above all of them, implies that every set of reals\nin \\(L(\\mathbb{R})\\) is determined, i.e., the axiom\n\\(AD^{L(\\mathbb{R})}\\) holds, hence all sets of real numbers that\nbelong to \\(L(\\mathbb{R})\\), and therefore all projective sets, are\nregular. He also showed that Woodin cardinals provide the optimal\nlarge cardinal assumptions by proving that the following two\nstatements:\n\n\n\nThere are infinitely many Woodin cardinals.\n\n\n\\(AD^{L({\\Bbb R})}\\).\n\n\nare equiconsistent, i.e., ZFC plus 1 is consistent if and only if ZFC\nplus 2 is consistent. See the entry on\n large cardinals and determinacy\n for more details and related results.\n\nAnother area in which large cardinals play an important role is the\nexponentiation of singular cardinals. The so-called Singular\nCardinal Hypothesis (SCH) completely determines the behavior of\nthe exponentiation for singular cardinals, modulo the exponentiation\nfor regular cardinals. The SCH follows from the GCH, and so it holds\nin \\(L\\). A consequence of the SCH is that if\n\\(2^{\\aleph_n}<\\aleph_\\omega\\), for all finite \\(n\\), then\n\\(2^{\\aleph_{\\omega}}=\\aleph_{\\omega +1}\\). Thus, if the GCH holds for\ncardinals smaller than \\(\\aleph_\\omega\\), then it also holds at\n\\(\\aleph_\\omega\\). The SCH holds above the first supercompact cardinal\n(Solovay). But Magidor (1977) showed that, remarkably, assuming the\nexistence of large cardinals it is possible to build a model of ZFC\nwhere the GCH first fails at \\(\\aleph_\\omega\\), hence the SCH fails.\nLarge cardinals stronger than measurable are actually needed for this.\nIn contrast, however, ZFC alone suffices to prove that if the SCH\nholds for all cardinals smaller than \\(\\aleph_{\\omega_1}\\), then it\nalso holds for \\(\\aleph_{\\omega_1}\\). Moreover, if the SCH holds for\nall singular cardinals of countable cofinality, then it holds for all\nsingular cardinals (Silver).\n",
