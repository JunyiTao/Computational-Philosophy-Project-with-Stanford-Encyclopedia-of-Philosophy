    "main_text": "Collective Responsibility and the Question of Consequences\n7. Forward Looking Collective Responsibility\n\nWhile the majority of those now writing on collective responsibility\ncontinue to focus on the kind of responsibility explored above, i.e.,\nbackward looking collective responsibility, a small but growing number\nof philosophers have chosen to focus instead on forward looking\ncollective responsibility. Two things appear to explain such a shift\nin focus. The first is the recognition that collective entities such\nas states, corporations, and movements may now be the only agents\ncapable of preventing particular kinds of suffering in the world. The\nsecond is the publication of David Miller\u2019s National\nResponsibility and Global Justice (Miller 2007), Iris\nYoung\u2019s Responsibility for Justice (Young 2011), and\nPeter French and Howard Weinstein\u2019s edited collection\nForward Looking Collective Responsibility (French and\nWeinstein 2014).\n\nWhat is forward looking responsibility? Forward looking\nresponsibility, like its backward looking counterpart, refers to a\ncollective agent\u2019s responsibility for a particular state of\naffairs in the world. But, unlike its backward looking counterpart, it\ndoes not make responsibility out to be a matter of having caused an\nexisting (morally problematic) state of affairs. Instead, it makes\nresponsibility out to be a matter of being morally charged\nwith\u2014responsible for\u2014bringing about a state of affairs\nwhich we as a community consider to be better. Hence, when we ascribe\nforward looking responsibility to a collective agent, we do not tell a\ncausal story about the agent. Instead, we specify what the agent\nshould be doing in the world.\n\nNot surprisingly, we often end up pointing to the particular tasks\nthat we think the agent should be carrying out and refer to these\ntasks as the agent\u2019s responsibilities. But we need to\nbe careful here. For forward looking responsibility is not simply a\nmatter of carrying out tasks. Instead, it is a matter of being morally\ncharged with bringing about a state of affairs that is, by virtue of\nthe ascription of forward looking responsibility itself, now part of\nthe agent\u2019s moral business. Hence, in discussions of forward\nlooking responsibility, we do not simply say of an agent that the\nagent has responsibilities X, Y, and Z. Instead, we say that the agent\nis responsible for making sure that a particularly desirable state of\naffairs X, Y, or Z comes into existence.\n\nSince forward looking responsibility requires that an agent bring\nabout a particular state of affairs, it has a lot in common with\nbeing morally obliged to do something. But the emphasis is\ndifferent. So, too, is the level of flexibility associated with moral\nagency. In cases where we use the language of moral obligation, we\nsignal that the agent has to perform a particular act. In cases where\nwe use the language of responsibility, we allow the agent to use its\nown judgment in deciding how to bring about the desired state of\naffairs. Likewise, we charge it with exercising its judgment\nwisely.\n\nWhat is morally salient about forward looking collective\nresponsibility? Backward looking collective responsibility, as we have\nseen, is morally salient because of its association with\nblameworthiness. Forward looking responsibility is not completely\nremoved from considerations of blame\u2014we sometimes blame those\nwho fail to take their responsibilities seriously\u2014but it is not\nmorally salient because blame sometimes enters the picture. Instead,\nit is morally salient because we think that such responsibility may,\nif taken seriously by those who are being held responsible, help to\nbring about a desirable (or better) state of affairs in the world.\n\nThe requirements associated with forward looking collective\nresponsibility are not as steep as those associated with its backward\nlooking counterpart. Nor are they as metaphysical. For, unlike its\nbackward looking counterpart, forward looking collective\nresponsibility is not designed to capture an agent\u2019s will.\nInstead, it is designed to distribute moral labor. Hence, while\nforward looking collective responsibility only works with purposeful\nagents, it does not require either a \u201ccollective mind\u201d or\nthat an agent be able to form \u201cwe intentions\u201d. Instead, it\nrequires only that the agent be able to do something in the\nworld and take responsibility for making things happen.\n\nWhile forward looking collective responsibility is thus not saddled\nwith controversial metaphysical conditions in the way that its\nbackward looking counterpart is, it is not without its own\ncontroversies. In some cases, these controversies are about what kinds\nof groups are capable of forward looking collective responsibility.\nBill Wringe (Wringe 2014) and Felix Pinket (Pinket 2014) cover these\ncontroversies nicely. In other cases, they are about how\u2014on what\nnormative basis\u2014we can ascribe forward collective looking\nresponsibility in practice. What principles should we invoke to do so?\nHow should we order these principles?\n\nInterestingly enough, not everyone thinks that such principles are\nnecessary. Indeed, a few key figures in the field still assume that\nforward looking (remedial) responsibility is grounded in causal\nresponsibility for the harm now deemed in need of a remedy. David\nLyons (Lyons 2004) feels comfortable assuming that because the U.S.\nwas causally responsibility for poverty and racism in the past, it now\nhas a responsibility for doing everything that it can to create\nopportunities for the poor and minorities. David Schmidtz (Schmidtz\n1998), who, in contrast to Lyons, takes the poor to be causally\nresponsible for many of their own problems, also moves directly from\ncausal to remedial responsibility. So, too, does Iris Young (Young\n2011).\n\nBut, again, we need to be careful. For, forward looking (remedial)\nresponsibility is not ascribed for the purpose of gauging moral agency\nper se. Instead, it is ascribed for the purpose of ensuring the\nsuccess of a particular, morally justifiable, project, e.g.,\nalleviating poverty, hunger, or racism. Hence, when it comes to\nforward looking responsibility, we need to think about who is in the\nbest position to do something about the harm, and when we do, as\nRobert Goodin (1998) points out, we may\u2014and probably\nwill\u2014discover in some cases that the agent who caused the harm\nis not the agent who is now able to remedy it in practice.\n\nNone of this suggests that we should abandon judgments of causal\nresponsibility altogether when ascribing forward looking\nresponsibility. Indeed, as we suggest shortly, such judgments may\nbecome relevant to matters of fairness in ascribing remedial\nresponsibility. But it does suggest that we cannot move directly from\ncausal to remedial responsibility, i.e., ground the latter exclusively\nin the former. Likewise, it does suggest that we need intermediary\nconsiderations. Carol Rovane (Rovane 2014), Tracy Isaacs (Isaacs 2011;\nIsaacs 2014), Ludger Jansen (Jansen 2014), Derrick Darby and Nyla\nBranscombe (Darby and Branscombe, 2014) and Marion Smiley (Smiley\n2014) all make this clear from their own theoretical perspectives.\n\nHow, then, are we to ascribe forward looking collective responsibility\nin practice? At the very least, we need to make room for various kinds\nof practical judgments, including those that draw attention to who is\nbest able to remedy the harm in question and at what cost. But such\npractical judgments, which are very important, are not the only\nnon-causal matters that we need to take into consideration when\nascribing forward looking responsibility. Indeed, as recent debates\nconcerning our responsibility for remedying health care problems at\nhome, starvation abroad, and environmental disasters everywhere\nattest, judgments about the relative value of our projects in the\nworld are also crucial. So, too, are judgments about fairness and\nobligation.\n\nNot surprisingly, we incorporate judgments about relative value\nprimarily in cases where we cannot pursue all of our\nprojects\u2014eradicating hunger, bringing up healthy children,\ncreating jobs, reversing global warming\u2014at once or even at all.\nBut we make these judgments in other kinds of cases as well, including\nthose in which a supposed cause of harm, say, capitalism, is also the\ncause of something that we value. In these cases, we may think that\nour choice to focus on a particular state of affairs is\nuncontroversial. But it is in fact steeped in our own priorities.\n\nTake, for example, Young\u2019s ascriptions of responsibility for\nalleviating poverty, hunger, and violence around the world cited\nabove. Young may be correct that capitalism (or at least unregulated\ncapitalism) is causally responsible for these problems. (There would\nof course be other agents to consider as well.) But if she is going to\ngo on to ascribe remedial responsibility to those who benefit from\ncapitalism\u2014which is what she is concerned to do\u2014then she\nhas to take into consideration that capitalism (or at least regulated\ncapitalism) may also be causally responsible for things in the world\nthat we value, e.g., significant improvements in health care,\neducation, and food production, as well as the separation of economic\nfrom political power.\n\nMoreover, she has to take these things into consideration because of\nthe very nature of remedial responsibility itself as organized and\ndistributed across cases. Remedial responsibility, as we have seen, is\nattached to a particular project. (Who, we ask, is responsible for\ncarrying out this project?) But it cannot be formulated in isolation.\nInstead, it has to be formulated with an eye to our other projects.\nFor, we are limited with respect to both moral energy and resources.\nHence, we have to prioritize our projects as well as to coordinate our\nascriptions of remedial responsibility across them. Likewise, we have\nto be aware of the priorities that others, e.g., Young, incorporate\ninto their own ascriptions of remedial responsibility.\n\nAll of this is to suggest that if we want to ascribe remedial\nresponsibility in a justifiable fashion\u2014 in a way that avoids\narbitrariness and bias\u2014 we will have to argue openly about the\nrelative value of our projects and proceed with an overview in mind.\nWhat projects, we will have to ask, are most valuable to us and how do\nthey rank in importance with respect to other projects? Whose needs\nand interests are being taken into consideration by these projects?\nHow might we ensure that everyone\u2019s needs and interests are\ntaken into consideration? What is the relative cost of the projects in\nquestion and how does cost itself rank in importance here?\n\nRobert Goodin defends this kind of pragmatic approach to forward\nlooking collective responsibility in his arguments for why the U.S.\nshould be held responsible for providing the poor with welfare\nbenefits. In distancing himself from the practice of blame, he\nwrites:\n\nIt is forward-looking, task oriented, collective responsibility that I\nam championing.\u2026 There are good reasons for pursuing certain\nsorts of goals through some sort of coordinated, collective apparatus\nlike the state.\u2026Responsibilities get collectivized simply\nbecause that is the only realistic way (or anyway, much the most\neffective way) of discharging them. (Goodin 1998, p. 50)\n\n\nThe pragmatic approach to forward looking collective responsibility\ngestured to here is very valuable (and sound). But we cannot treat it\nin isolation from other approaches. In other words, we cannot simply\nreplace causal responsibility with capacity for remedying\na problem as a basis for ascribing forward looking\nresponsibility. Instead, we have to incorporate other values and\nprinciples into our ascriptions of responsibility. What might they be?\nAs things now stand, the value of fairness is frequently invoked, if\nnot thoroughly explored, in this context. So, too, are the values of\ncitizenship and collective obligation, as well as the principle of a\nsocial contract.\n\nAdmittedly, those who invoke the value of fairness in ascribing\nforward looking responsibility do not always have the same thing in\nmind by the term. Alexander Brown [2009] incorporates judgments about\nwho caused harm into his arguments about who can fairly be held\nresponsible for remedying such harm and, in doing so, treats fairness\nas a response to causal agency. Brown\u2019s concern is with the\nbehavioral lapses of the poor in a welfare state.\n\nIf a person is causally responsible for becoming an addict, then he\ncannot fairly expect our assistance in getting him off of\ndrugs.\u2026The government can only be expected to do so much.\n(Brown 2009, p. 151)\n\n\nMichael Walzer also considers fairness to be very important to\nascriptions of forward looking collective responsibility in a welfare\nstate. But he does not consider fairness in this context to rest on\nconsiderations of who caused harm. Instead, he considers it to rest on\nthe norms of communal membership. According to Walzer, a fair\ndistribution of responsibilities in a welfare state will always come\ndown to what we owe each other as members of a community\u2014which,\nfrom his perspective, translates into all of those things that will\nmake communal membership possible among those in the community, e.g.,\nfinancial security, health care, education, peace, and security,\nregardless of whether members caused harm to themselves. (Walzer\n2008)\n\nChristian Neuhauser, who underscores the importance of distributive\njustice in the organization of forward looking collective\nresponsibility, concurs on the importance of fairness to the\nascription of remedial responsibility. But he takes things in a\nsomewhat different direction from both Brown and Walzer by treating\nfairness as a matter of doing one\u2019s fair share.\nMoreover, Neuhauser places fairness in the context of various\ncollective action scenarios. Hence, he is naturally led to talk about\nfairness as a motivating force. \u201cThe motivation of\nagents to embrace a forward looking responsibility also depends on\nwhether other actors contribute their fair share\u201d. (Neuhauser\n2014, p. 246)\n\nWhile the value of fairness is commonly invoked by those concerned to\nlocate criteria for ascribing (or organizing or distributing) forward\nlooking collective responsibility in practice, it is not the only\nvalue or principle in play. Indeed, many of those in the field\ncontinue to look to collective obligations as a basis for remedial\nresponsibility. In some cases, the collective obligations in question\nare thought to be built into the collective itself. (Miller 2007) In\nother cases, they are thought to derive from various other norms of\nmoral and political life.\n\nIn her discussion of forward looking collective responsibility and the\nprospects of war, Neta Crawford locates the source of these\nobligations in the sphere of citizenship. According to Crawford,\n\u201cordinary citizens have a collective moral and political\nresponsibility to participate in decisions about wars that are\nundertaken by their governments and they have a responsibility to\nprotest unjust wars or immoral conduct during wars.\u201d (Crawford,\n2014, p. 141) Moreover, they have such responsibility, according to\nCrawford, by virtue of their identity as citizens in a democratic\ncommunity. Bill Wringe takes such an analysis to the global level\n(Wringe 2014), as do many others in the field of global justice,\nincluding David Miller (2007).\n\nDerrick Darby and Nyla Branscombe, in their work on responsibility for\novercoming social, political, and economic inequality, choose to look,\nnot to the identities of democratic citizens, but to the kinds of\nsocial, political, and economic institutions that democratic citizens\nwould choose within a Rawlsian social contract, as a basis for\nascribing remedial responsibility. In doing so, they manage not only\nto bring both shared interests and rational choice together, but, in\ndoing so, to make clear what is unique about forward looking\nresponsibility.\n\nThe shift to a forward looking account of political responsibility\nrequires placing greater emphasis on the interest that we all share in\nsustaining the major social institutions that so profoundly shape our\nlife prospects.\u2026Hence, we should take political responsibility\nfor inequality given our vital interest in sustaining the system of\ncooperation and institutions that give rise to both permissible and\nimpermissible inequalities. (Darby and Branscombe 2014, p. 133)\n\n\nTracy Isaacs, who develops a full-blown account of collective\nobligations and their relationship to collective responsibility\n[Isaacs 2011 and 2014], points to many of the norms cited above and\nemphasizes the centrality of identity. But, interestingly enough, she\ndoes not steer clear of causal responsibility in doing so. Instead,\nshe offers a sophisticated view of how causal responsibility helps\nshape our criteria for ascribing remedial responsibility fairly.\n\nAgents who are causally implicated and who benefit do indeed bear a\nheavier burden of obligation for alleviating harmful circumstances.\nWhere collective obligation is concerned, these connections to the\nharm or wrong doing make some collective agents more obligated than\nothers\u2026and play a role in determining the identity of the\ncollective agent who has the collective obligation. (Isaacs 2014, p.\n41)\n\n\nAll of these arguments underscore the cluster of values and principles\nthat go into ascribing forward looking collective responsibility in\npractice. Isaac\u2019s work in particular provides a way of bringing\ncausal responsibility back into play without either blurring the\ndistinction between backward and forward looking responsibility or\ntreating the latter as a natural extension of the former. How, if at\nall, should we prioritize all of these values, principles, and causal\njudgments, in ascribing remedial responsibility? It has been suggested\n(Smiley 2014) that instead of treating one of them as primary and the\nothers as secondary we bring all of them together into a pluralistic\nnormative account of forward looking collective responsibility.\n\nIn doing so, we would undoubtedly make the project of forward looking\ncollective responsibility out to be more complicated than it now\nappears to be in the hands of those who choose one value to place at\nthe center of our attention in this context. But we would also make it\nmore sensitive to the various ethical demands that we rightly place on\neach other in holding each other responsible for harm in the\nworld.\n\nWhat about the practical constraints associated with forward looking\ncollective responsibility? Two such constraints (or possible\nconstraints) have come to the fore in recent years. The first has to\ndo with structured injustice. The second has to do with how we can (or\ncannot) move forward in cases where our collective is not yet\norganized, i.e., in cases where the kind of collective required for\nremedial action, namely one that is capable of acting, still has to be\ncreated or at least organized.\n\nIris Young introduces the matter of structural injustice in her\narguments for why we should now be focussing on forward looking rather\nthan backward looking, collective responsibility. According to Young,\nwe should be focussing on forward looking collective responsibility\nbecause the source of much injustice in the world is located in\nsocial, economic, and political structures, and only forward looking\ncollective responsibility can deal with confronting these structures\nhead-on. Robert Goodin and Christian Barry (2021) argue persuasively\nagainst the sharp distinction that Young relies on here between\nindividualized responsibility for past structural injustice and\ncollective responsibility for preventing structural injustice in the\nfuture. Moreover, Young herself relies on backward looking causal\nhistories of various collectives that bring about harm to sustain her\nnotion of forward looking collective responsibility. Nevertheless, her\ninsistence on viewing both backward and forward looking collective\nresponsibility through the lens of structural injustice sets a very\nimportant precedent for future theorizing in the field.\n\nThe second practical challenge to the practice of forward looking\ncollective responsibility pertains to the dilemma that we face when\ntrying to hold disorganized collectives responsible for preventing\nharm in the future that they could, if they were organized, prevent.\nThe problem is that they are not now organized and hence cannot act as\na collective. A transformation is necessary. But we cannot expect a\ndisorganized group (say, a mob or a group of persons who are not in\nany way institutionally connected) to instigate such a transformation.\nFor such a group is by definition not organized enough to act as a\ncollective.\n\nWhat, then, are we to do? How can we transform a disorganized group\ninto one that is organized enough to take on a collective obligation\nto prevent harm? A promising solution here might be to revisit the\nplace of individual moral agents in ascribing forward looking\ncollective responsibility in cases where a group is not yet organized\nenough to be ascribed such responsibility. In particular, we might\nwant to ask how, if at all, individual moral agents might be motivated\nand even obligated to create the kind of organized collective that is\nneeded here.\n\nNot surprisingly, the value of self-interest comes to the fore here,\nespecially with the recognition that moral agents may have\nintergenerational interests moving forward. But we need not rely on\nself-interest. Nor need we forgo the possibility that existing moral\nsystems of a non-utilitarian kind can provide the necessary moral\nmotivation. Indeed, we may even be able to argue that individual moral\nagents in a not-yet-organized collective (that, if organized, could\nprevent harm) have a moral duty to create (together) the kind of\ncollective capable of performing the required actions.\n\nFrank Hindriks takes on this challenge in \u201cThe Duty to Join\nForces: When Individuals Lack Control\u201d (Hindriks, 2019) and\nelsewhere (Blomberg and Hindriks, 2020). Hindriks argues very\npersuasively that we can create the required organized collective if\nwe can substantiate a duty on the part of the individual moral agents\nto join forces: to approach others, to convince them to contribute to\nthe joint efforts, and to become part of a collective action. This\nduty is initially associated with individual moral agents. But,\nHindriks claims, since it focuses on mobilizing others rather than on\npreventing harm per se, it is \u201cirreducibly\ncollective\u201d (Hindriks, p. 204).\n\nWhether or not the duty expressed here is \u201cirreducibly\ncollective\u201d (as distinct from being a fusion of individual and\ncollective responsibility) it does appear to be a very promising\nsolution to one of the thorniest problems associated with forward\nlooking collective responsibility, namely, how to bring organized\ncollectives about in cases where their existence is crucial to the\nprevention of harm.\n\nSuffice it here to underscore three more general points suggested by\nefforts such as Hindriks\u2019. The first is that reliance on\nindividual moral duties and other kinds of individually based\nincentives to create new (or newly recognized) collective entities\ndoes not undermine the integrity of forward looking collective\nresponsibility, but instead makes the latter possible. The second is\nthat the creation (or recognition) of these new collective entities is\nabsolutely crucial in cases where we are faced, in Stephen\nGardiner\u2019s words (Gardiner, 2017), with \u201cparadigmatically\nglobal, intergenerational and ecological problems such as climate\nchange\u201d (Gardiner, 2017, p. 22) that require an expanded\ncommunity of both concern and action. The third is that when we step\nback and ask how these expanded communities of concern and action can\nbe created, we confront the importance of thinking about individual\nand collective responsibility, not as mutually exclusive, but, at\nleast in some cases, as mutually supportive in both theory and\npractice.\n",
