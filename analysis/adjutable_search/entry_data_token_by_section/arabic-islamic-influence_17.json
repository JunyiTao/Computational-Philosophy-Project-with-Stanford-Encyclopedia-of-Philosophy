    "main_text": "Metaphysics || The First Cause and the Emanation of the Intelligences\n6.4 The First Cause and the Emanation of the Intelligences\n\nThe influence of Avicenna\u2019s concept of the first cause as the\nonly necessary being in itself (w\u0101jib al-wuj\u016bd\nbi-\u1e0f\u0101tih\u012b, necesse esse per se) and of\nhis theory of emanation is apparent already in the twelfth century.\nDominicus Gundisalvi, the Avicenna translator, distinguishes in his\nProcession of the World (De processione mundi)\nbetween the first cause, which is the \u201cnecessary being\u201d\n(necesse esse), and the created beings, which in themselves\nare only possible beings. The entire universe proceeds from the first\ncause. The principles first created, however, are not the\nintelligences, as in Avicenna\u2019s metaphysics, but the material\nand formal principles of the things (Jolivet 1988, 138\u2013140;\nPolloni 2017, 532\u2013538).\n\nThe anonymous author of The Book of First and Second Causes (Liber\nde causis primis et secundis), which dates from the turn of the\nthirteenth century, does not adopt the distinction between necessary\nand possible beings, but describes the process of emanation in\nstrongly Avicennian terms: From the first cause issues a first created\nbeing, an intellect. From this intellect, in turn, emanates a series\nof intelligences, the lowest of which is the active intellect.\nEmanation happens in triads: From an intelligence emanates, in virtue\nof its intellectual activity, the form of a celestial sphere, the body\nof a sphere, and another intelligence (ch. 4). The anonymous author\nalso draws on the Book of Causes (see the beginning of\nsection 6 above), for instance when describing the hierarchy of\nintelligences as a decrease in power and unity (ch. 6).\n\nWilliam of Auvergne (d. 1249) is much attracted by Arabic metaphysical\nand pyschological theories (which he often indiscriminately attributes\nto \u201cAristotle and his followers\u201d) and discusses them at\nlength, but often rejects them in the end as conflicting with\nChristian faith. In On the Universe (De universo\nII.1), William discusses and rejects the Avicennian emanation system:\nthe necessity of causation through the first cause; the emanation of\nthe intelligences from the first intelligence down to the active\nintellect; the active intellect as the efficient cause of human souls.\nHe nevertheless tacitly adopts the metaphysical principle \u201cFrom\none arises only one\u201d (de uno non nisi unum) from\nAvicenna (Teske 1993), in particular within the context of Trinitarian\ntheology (Fischer 2015), and describes the first cause as the\n\u201cbeing necessary through itself\u201d (Teske 2002, Fischer\n2018).\n\nThomas Aquinas adopts from Avicenna the description of God as the\nnecessary being, whose essence is its own existence (Summa contra\ngentiles I.22). Avicenna\u2019s influence is also apparent in a\nwell-known passage: the \u201cfive ways\u201d (quinque\nviae) of proving God\u2019s existence in the Summa\ntheologiae (Ia q. 2 a. 3). The third proof advances via\n\u201cthe possible and the necessary\u201d: It establishes the\nexistence of something necessary in virtue of itself. The proof is\nmuch coloured by Avicennian metaphysics, but its direct source is\nMaimonides\u2019 Guide for the Perplexed (II.1), from which\nit deviates only in minor respects. A conspicuous element of\nMaimonides\u2019 and Thomas\u2019 proof is the premise, not\nexplicitly formulated by Avicenna, that, in an eternal world, every\npossibility is eventually realized, which is a version of the\nso-called \u201cprinciple of plenitude\u201d (Davidson 1987,\n378\u2013388). Thomas, however, rejects the Avicennian theory of\nemanation. The creation of the world is not a necessary process, and\nit does not occur through intermediaries, that is, intelligences or\nangels. He also rejects Avicenna\u2019s theory of a separate active\nintellect as the giver of the forms of the sublunar world and as the\nontological place of the intelligibles, a theory against which Thomas\nadvances epistemological arguments in the first place (Summa\ncontra gentiles II.42 and II.76). Albertus Magnus, in contrast,\ntacitly adopts much of the dator formarum theory in several\nof his writings, even though he often voices his criticism of it\n(Hasse 2012).\n\nThe attraction of Avicenna\u2019s position is evident in the work of\nSiger of Brabant. In some of his writings, Siger teaches that God as\nthe first being creates only one being immediately, the first\nimmaterial substance, from which emanate the other intelligences, the\ncelestial spheres and finally the sublunar world, in an eternal and\nnecessary process. The necessity is not universal, however, but finds\nits limits in the contingency and in the free will which exists in the\nsublunar world (De necessitate et contingentia causarum; Van\nSteenberghen 1991, 346). Duns Scotus, in contrast, is very critical of\nAvicenna\u2019s theory of necessary causation through the first\ncause. He advances several reasons against it, the most important\nbeing that there can only be contingency in the world if the first\ncause does not act by necessity (Ordinatio I d. 8 p. 2 q.\nun).\n\nSeveral theses on the first cause and the intelligences which are\ninspired by Avicenna are condemned by the Parisian bishop in 1277,\namong them: that God is the first necessary cause of the first\nintelligence and of the celestial movements (art. 58 and 59), that God\ndoes necessarily what is immediately produced by him (art. 53), that\nthe active intellect is a substance separate from the human intellect\n(art. 123), that the rational souls are created by the intelligences\n(art. 30). Avicenna\u2019s theory of the first cause nevertheless\ncontinued to influence the scholastic discussion. This is true, for\ninstance, of the proof for the existence of God, which had been cited\nby Thomas Aquinas. Peter of Auvergne, Henry of Ghent and Duns Scotus\ntoo draw on Avicenna\u2019s argument from the possible and necessary\nbeing (Druart 2002; Janssens 2003; Pickav\u00e9 2007, ch. 6).\n\nThe 1270 and 1277 condemnations were also directed against another\ntheory based on Arabic sources: astrological determinism (art. 143,\n161, 167, 195, 206, 207). The condemnations do not testify to the\ninfluence of Arabic philosophers proper: Avicenna was critical of\nastrology for epistemological reasons and Averroes embedded\nastrological doctrines in Peripatetic mainstream theories about the\ninfluence of the stars. Rather, the condemnations indicate that Arabic\nastrologers such as Albumasar and Alcabitius were very influential in\nthe Latin West already in the thireenth century.\n",
