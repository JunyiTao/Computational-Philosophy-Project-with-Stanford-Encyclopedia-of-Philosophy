    "main_text": "\n\nThe basic idea of counterfactual theories of causation is that the\nmeaning of causal claims can be explained in terms of counterfactual\nconditionals of the form \u201cIf A had not occurred,\nC would not have occurred\u201d. Most counterfactual\nanalyses have focused on claims of the form \u201cevent c\ncaused event e\u201d, describing \u2018singular\u2019 or\n\u2018token\u2019 or \u2018actual\u2019 causation. Such analyses\nhave become popular since the development in the 1970s of possible\nworld semantics for counterfactuals. The best-known counterfactual\nanalysis of causation is David Lewis\u2019s (1973b) theory. However,\nintense discussion over forty years has cast doubt on the adequacy of\nany simple analysis of singular causation in terms of counterfactuals.\nRecent years have seen a proliferation of different refinements of the\nbasic idea; the \u2018structural equations\u2019 or \u2018causal\nmodelling\u2019 framework is currently the most popular way of\ncashing out the relationship between causation and counterfactuals.\n\n",
