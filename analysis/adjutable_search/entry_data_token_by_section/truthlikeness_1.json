    "main_text": "The Logical Problem || What\u2019s the problem?\n1.1 What\u2019s the problem?\n\nSuppose we are interested in what is the number of planets in the\nsolar system. With the demotion of Pluto to planetoid status, the\ntruth of this matter is that there are precisely 8 planets. Now, the\nproposition the number of planets in our solar system is 9\nmay be false, but quite a bit closer to the truth than the proposition\nthat the number of planets in our solar system is 9 billion.\n(One falsehood may be closer to the truth than another falsehood.) The\ntrue proposition the number of the planets is between 7 and 9\ninclusive is closer to the truth than the true proposition that\nthe number of the planets is greater than or equal to 0. (So\na truth may be closer to the truth than another truth.) Finally, the\nproposition that the number of the planets is either less than or\ngreater than 9 may be true but it is arguably not as close to the\nwhole truth as its highly accurate but strictly false\nnegation: that there are 9 planets.\n\nThis particular numerical example is admittedly simple, but a wide\nvariety of judgments of relative likeness to truth crop up both in\neveryday parlance as well as in scientific discourse. While some\ninvolve the relative accuracy of claims concerning the value of\nnumerical magnitudes, others involve the sharing of properties,\nstructural similarity, or closeness among putative laws.\n\nConsider a non-numerical example, also highly simplified but quite\ntopical in the light of the recent rise in status of the concept of\nfundamentality. Suppose you are interested in the truth about\nwhich particles are fundamental. At the outset of your inquiry all you\nknow are various logical truths, like the tautology either\nelectrons are fundamental or they are not. Tautologies are pretty\nmuch useless in helping you locate the truth about fundamental\nparticles. Suppose that the standard model is actually on the right\ntrack. Then, learning that electrons are fundamental edges you a\nlittle bit closer to your goal. It is by no means the complete truth\nabout fundamental particles, but it is a piece of it. If you go on to\nlearn that electrons, along with muons and tau particles, are a kind\nof lepton and that all leptons are fundamental, you have presumably\nedged closer.\n\nIf this is right, then some truths are closer to the truth about\nfundamental particles than others.\n\nThe discovery that atoms are not fundamental, that they are in fact\ncomposite objects, displaced the earlier hypothesis that atoms are\nfundamental. For a while the proposition that protons,\nneutrons and electrons are the fundamental components of atoms\nwas embraced, but unfortunately it too turned out to be false. Still,\nthis latter falsehood seems closer to the truth than its predecessor\n(assuming, again, that the standard model is true). And even if the\nstandard model contains errors, as surely it does, it is presumably\ncloser to the truth about fundamental particles than these other\nfalsehoods.\n\nSo again, some falsehoods may be closer to the truth about fundamental\nparticles than other falsehoods.\n\nAs we have seen, a tautology is not a terrific truth locator, but if\nyou moved from the tautology that electrons either are or are not\nfundamental to embrace the false proposition that electrons\nare not fundamental you would have moved further from your\ngoal.\n\nSo, some truths are closer to the truth than some falsehoods.\n\nBut it is by no means obvious that all truths about fundamental\nparticles are closer to the whole truth than any falsehood. The false\nproposition that electrons, protons and neutrons are the\nfundamental components of atoms, for instance, may well be an\nimprovement over the tautology.\n\nIf this is right, certain falsehoods are closer to the truth than some\ntruths.\n\nInvestigations into the concept of truthlikeness only began in earnest\nin the early nineteen sixties. Why was truthlikeness such a\nlatecomer to the philosophical scene? It wasn\u2019t until the latter\nhalf of the twentieth century that mainstream philosophers gave up on\nthe Cartesian goal of infallible knowledge. The idea that we are quite\npossibly, even probably, mistaken in our most cherished beliefs, that\nthey might well be just false, was mostly considered\ntantamount to capitulation to the skeptic. By the middle of the\ntwentieth century, however, it was clear that many of our commonsense\nbeliefs, as well as previous scientific theories, are strictly\nspeaking, false. Further, the increasingly rapid turnover of\nscientific theories suggested that, far from being certain, they are\never vulnerable to refutation, and typically are eventually refuted\nand replaced by some new theory. The history of inquiry is one of a\nparade of refuted theories, replaced by other theories awaiting their\nturn at the guillotine. (This is the \u201cdismal induction\u201d,\nsee also the entry\n on realism and theory change in science.)\n\nRealism holds that the constitutive aim of inquiry is the\ntruth of some matter. Optimism holds that the history of\ninquiry is one of progress with respect to its constitutive aim. But\nfallibilism holds that our theories are false or very likely\nto be false, and to be replaced by other false theories. To combine\nthese three ideas, we must affirm that some false propositions better\nrealize the goal of truth \u2013 are closer to the truth \u2013 than\nothers. We are thus stuck with the logical problem of\ntruthlikeness.\n\nWhile a multitude of apparently different solutions to the problem\nhave been proposed, they can be classified into three main\napproaches, each with its own heuristic \u2013 the content\napproach, the consequence approach and the likeness\napproach. Before exploring these possible solutions to the logical\nproblem, it could be useful to dispel a couple of common confusions,\nsince truthlikeness should not be conflated with either epistemic\nprobability or with vagueness. We discuss this latter notion in the\n supplement Why truthlikeness is not probability or vagueness (see\n also the entry on\n vagueness);\n as for the former, we shall discuss the difference between (expected)\ntruthlikeness and probability when discussing the epistemological\nproblem (\u00a72).\n",
