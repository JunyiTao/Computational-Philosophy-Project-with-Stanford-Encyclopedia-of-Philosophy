    "main_text": "Payment || Payment and the Welfare of the Child\n4.3 Egg Sharing\n\nSome countries (notably the United Kingdom) either prohibit or\nstrictly limit payments to egg donors but allow an exception whereby\n\u2018egg sharers\u2019 (women who are themselves undergoing\ninfertility treatment and wish to donate in return for reduced fees)\ncan receive unlimited benefits-in-kind in the form of cut-price\ninfertility treatment services. The UK, for example, limits payments\nto egg donors to \u00a3750 (approx. US$900) and yet egg sharers can\nhave their own treatment costs reduced by many thousands of pounds\n(HFEA 2017: guidance note 13).\n\nThis raises the question of whether ethically egg sharing is\npreferable to egg selling and, if so, why\u2014along with the closely\nrelated question of whether egg sharing should be treated more\nfavourably in law and professional regulation (Blyth & Golding\n2008).\n\nThe main reason offered in favour of egg sharing is that\n\u2018sharers\u2019 are exposed to less additional harm and/or risk\nthan donors (paid or otherwise), since they are already\nundergoing most of the required interventions as part of ongoing\ntreatment. It is supposed to follow from this that incentivising egg\nsharing (other things being equal) is less morally problematic than\nincentivising egg donation: either because of the putative wrongness\nof encouraging people to take \u2018excessive\u2019 risks, or\nbecause financial incentives may vitiate consent to those risks\n(Wilkinson 2013).\n\nThis does seem like a sound prima facie reason to prefer egg\nsharing although several caveats must be noted. First, some special\ntypes of risk may apply to egg sharers: for example, older women who\ndon\u2019t have many viable eggs left might reduce their chances of\nhaving a child by giving away \u2018surplus\u2019 eggs (Scott,\nWilliams, Ehrich, & Farsides 2012). Second, and similarly,\nconcerns about consent may apply just as forcefully to egg sharers as\nto egg sellers, especially if some of these are\n\u2018desperate\u2019 to have a child and egg sharing is their only\nway of paying for infertility treatment services (Blyth & Golding\n2008). Thirdly, as already mentioned, this argument\u2014if it\nworked\u2014would show egg sharing to be superior not only to paid\ndonation but also to altruistic donation, since the additional risks\nare the same whether paid or not (Wilkinson 2013).\n\nA different kind of reason for treating egg sharing more favourably\nthan egg selling is based on the idea that egg sharers\u2019 motives\nwill typically by morally preferable to those of egg sellers. In\nparticular, it has been claimed that whereas egg sellers are typically\nmotivated by the desire for money, egg sharers act partly out of a\nsense of solidarity with potential recipients\u2014in particular\nbecause both the sharer and the recipient are in similar positions.\nBoth need, or want, infertility treatment services in order to have a\nchild (HFEA 2011; Prainsack & Buyx 2011).\n\nHowever, whether this really justifies the differential treatment of\nbenefits-in-kind (treatment services) and monetary reward is far from\nclear. One reason for doubt is that, as the HFEA notes:\n\n\nWhat is known about donor motivation \u2026 is that it is\nmultifaceted. People make decisions for a range of reasons, and\ncompetent adults are capable of assessing the relative benefits,\nburdens and likely impact of a range of options available to them. An\nincentive to donate does not necessarily mean people will do so purely\nbecause of that incentive. Indeed, the literature suggests that both\ndonors and sharers have mixed motives for donating. (HFEA 2011:\nsection 2, 4.4 [p. 8])\n\n\nThis suggests that, in relation to solidarity, there is no categorical\ndifference between payment and benefits-in-kind. While some egg\nsharers may be motivated mainly by feelings of solidarity, others may\nbe more interested simply in saving money. Conversely, while some paid\ndonors would be \u2018in it just for the money\u2019, others\n(perhaps those whose close friends or relatives have fertility\nproblems, or who have experienced health problems of their own) could\nbe moved to donate because of feelings of solidarity (the fact that\nthey are financially rewarded notwithstanding). As such, it is by no\nmeans obvious that all egg sharers are motivated by feelings of\nsolidarity, or that all paid donors would fail to have this feeling.\nIndeed, it is by no means obvious even that most egg sharers\nare motivated by feelings of solidarity and there is empirical\nevidence suggesting that the number of sharers significantly decreases\nwhen state funded treatment is made widely available (Pennings\n2009).\n\nFinally, and more fundamentally, even if donations motivated\nby altruism or solidarity were morally preferable to more\nself-interested ones (donations motivated purely by the desire for\nmoney, for example) it would not necessarily follow that the latter\nare wrong or should be prohibited. For, it may just be that the former\nare supererogatory: that while paid donation is merely\npermissible, unpaid donation is an act of generosity or solidarity that\ngoes beyond what is morally permitted or required (Wilkinson &\nGarrard 1996).\n",
