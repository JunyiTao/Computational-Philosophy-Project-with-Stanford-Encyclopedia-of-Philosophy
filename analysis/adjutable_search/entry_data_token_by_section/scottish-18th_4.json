    "main_text": "Kames on aesthetics and religion\n5. Kames on aesthetics and religion\n\nHenry Home, Lord Kames, likewise held a version of providential\nnaturalism. In his Essays on the Principles of Morality and\nNatural Religion (1779) he has a good deal to say about the\nsenses external and internal, treating them as enabling us, by the\noriginal frame of our nature, to gain access, without the use of\nreasoning processes, to the realities in the corresponding domains,\nincluding the moral domain. Kames\u2019s moral sense has as much to\ndo with aesthetics as with morality; or rather, for Kames, no less\nthan for Hutcheson, virtue is a kind of beauty, moral beauty, as vice\nis moral deformity. Beauty itself is ascribed to anything that gives\npleasure. And as there are degrees of pleasure and pain, so also there\nare degrees of beauty and ugliness. In the lowest rank are things\nconsidered without regard to an end or a designing agent. The\npossibility of greater pleasure, and of the ascription of greater\nbeauty, arises when an object is considered with respect to the\nobject\u2019s end. A house, considered in itself, might be beautiful,\nbut how much more beautiful is it judged to be if it is seen to be\nwell designed for human occupancy.\n\nApprobation, as applied to works of art, is our pleasure at them when\nwe consider them to be well fitted or suited to an end. The\napprobation is greater if the end for which the object is well suited\nalso gives pleasure. A ship may give pleasure because it is so\nshapely, and also give pleasure because it is well suited to trade,\nand also give pleasure because trade also is a fine thing. If these\nfurther things are taken into account the beauty of the ship is\nenhanced. Kames argues that these kinds of pleasure can also be taken\nin human actions, and that human acts can cause pleasure additionally\nby the special fact about them that they proceed from intention,\ndeliberation and choice. In the case of, for example, an act of\ngenerosity towards a worthy person, the act is intentionally well\nsuited, or fitted, to an end whose beauty is recognised by the agent.\nThe fact that observation of acts displaying generosity, and other\nvirtues, gives us pleasure is due to the original constitution of our\nnature. The pleasure arises unbidden, and no exercise of will or\nreason is required, any more than we require to use our reason to see\nthe beauty of a landscape or a work of art.\n\nKames wrote extensively on revealed and natural theology. As regards\nthe latter, he often has Hume in his sights, particularly Hume\u2019s\nDialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1779), with whose\ncontents Kames was familiar decades before the work\u2019s\npublication. Hume held that in an inference from effect to cause no\nmore should be assigned to the cause than is sufficient to explain the\neffect. In particular, if we argue from the existence of the natural\nworld to the existence of God we should ascribe to God only such\nattributes as are requisite for the explanation of the world. And\nsince the world is imperfect, why not say that we are not constrained\nby the facts in the natural order to ascribe perfection to God? Kames,\non the other hand, holds that there are principles implanted in our\nnature that permit us to draw conclusions that reason alone does not\nsanction. If something is a tendency of our nature then we have to\nrely on it as a source of truth. Invoking just such a tendency Kames\naffirms that though we see both good and evil around us we do not\nconclude that the cause of the world must also be a mixture of good\nand evil: \u201cit is a tendency of our nature to reject a mixed\ncharacter of benevolence and malevolence, unless where it is\nnecessarily pressed home upon us by an equality of opposite effects;\nand in every subject that cannot be reached by the reasoning faculty,\nwe justly rely on the tendency of our nature\u201d (Essays,\np. 353). In any case Kames sees a world which is predominantly good\neven though it has \u2018a few cross instances\u2019. But the few\ncross instances might not look so cross, or even at all cross, if we\nhad a fuller perspective, and Kames anticipates the time when that\nperspective will be granted us.\n\nThis latter position did not raise the hackles of the zealots among\nthe Presbyterian clergy in Scotland, but Kames\u2019s position on\nfree will caused a furore and he had to defend himself from attempts\nto expel him from the Kirk. Kames, accepting the concept of history,\nnatural and human, as the gradual realisation of a divine plan,\nbelieved in universal necessity. The laws ordained by God\n\u201cproduce a regular train of causes and effects in the moral as\nwell as material world, bringing about those events which are\ncomprehended in the original plan, and admitting the possibility of\nnone other\u201d (Essays, p. 192). On the other hand, if we\nare to fulfill our role in the grand scheme we must see ourselves as\nable to initiate things, that is, to be the free cause of their\noccurrence. God has therefore, according to Kames, concealed from us\nthe necessity of our acts and he is therefore a deceitful God. Kames\nsought to explain how this divine deceit enables us to live as morally\naccountable beings, but this latter part of his philosophy did nothing\nto placate those in the Kirk for whom the affirmation of a deceitful\nGod was a sacrilege. Kames, however, could not see any difference\nbetween the deception by which we believe ourselves to be free when in\nfact we are necessitated and the deception by which we believe\nsecondary qualities, such as colours and sounds, to be in the external\nworld and able to get along without us, when in fact they depend for\ntheir existence upon the exercise of our own sensory powers.\n",
