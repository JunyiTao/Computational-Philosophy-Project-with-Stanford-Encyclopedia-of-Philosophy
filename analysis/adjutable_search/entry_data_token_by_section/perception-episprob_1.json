    "main_text": "Metaphysical Solutions to the Central Problem\n2. Metaphysical Solutions to the Central Problem\n\nThe Indirectness Principle is a metaphysical principle: it\nsays something about the nature of perception. The Metaevidential\nPrinciple and the No-Good-Reason Claim are epistemic\nprinciples: one lays down specifically normative requirements for\njustified belief and the other denies that these requirements are\nsatisfied. Because PEW can be challenged by denying any of the\npremises, there are two main classes of solution to the central\nproblem: metaphysical solutions, which challenge the Indirectness\nPrinciple; and epistemological solutions, which challenge the\nMetaevidential Principle and/or the No-Good-Reason Claim. This section\naddresses the first class of solutions to the central problem.\n Section 3\n addresses the second class.\n\nPEW starts with the Indirectness Principle, and it has often been\nthought that the central skeptical worry is due to a metaphysics of\nperception that holds that, although worldly objects do exist outside\nof the mind, they are never directly present to the mind, but only\nindirectly so, through mental intermediaries. Thomas Reid, for\nexample, held that \u201cDes Cartes\u2019 system, which I shall beg\nleave to call the ideal system, \u2026 hath some original\ndefect; that this skepticism is inlaid in it, and reared along with\nit\u201d (1785: 1.vii). Consequently, a great deal of philosophy\nsince Descartes has involved various attempts to block PEW by doing\naway with the intermediaries between the mind and the objects of\nperception, by offering a metaphysics of perception that puts these\nobjects directly before the mind. If perception is direct in the\nrelevant sense, then the skeptical problem never even gets off the\nground.\n\nThere are two main branches to this tradition. The more obvious and\ncommonsensical one originates with Reid (1764, 1785) who insists that\nphysical objects and their properties can be directly present to the\nmind as well as mental objects can. This is the direct realist option.\nEarlier on the scene, however, is a tradition tracing back to George\nBerkeley (1710, 1713), which agrees with Descartes that only mental\nitems are directly present to the mind but which holds that the\nobjects of perception\u2014tables, rocks, cats, etc.\u2014are really\nmental items after all. This is the idealist/phenomenalist option.\nDespite the manifest differences between realist and idealist\nmetaphysics, both branches of the \u201cdirect presence\u201d\ntradition are united in rejecting the Indirectness Principle,\ninsisting that tables and such are indeed directly present to the mind\nin perception. If perception is thus direct, the Indirectness\nPrinciple is false, and support for the Metaevidential Principle is\nundercut, and PEW ceases to pose a threat to knowledge.\n",
