Uncertainty relations for inaccuracy and disturbance\n\nBoth the standard deviation and the alternative measures of\nuncertainty considered in the previous subsection (and many more that\nwe have not mentioned!) are designed to indicate the width or spread\nof a single given probability distribution. Applied to quantum\nmechanics, where the probability distributions for position and\nmomentum are obtained from a given quantum state vector, one can use\nthem to formulate uncertainty relations that characterize the spread\nin those distribution for any given state. The resulting inequalities\nthen express limitations on what state-preparations quantum mechanics\nallows. They are thus expressions of what may be called a\npreparation uncertainty principle:\n\n\nIn quantum mechanics, it is impossible to prepare any system in a\nstate \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) such that its position and momentum\nare both precisely predictable, in the sense of having both the\nexpected spread in a measurement of position and the expected spread\nin a momentum measurement arbitrarily small.\n\n\nThe relations\n (9,\n 16,\n 19)\n all belong to this category; the mere difference being that they\nemploy different measures of spread: viz. the standard deviation, the\nbulk width or the Shannon entropy.\n\nNote that in this formulation, there is no reference to simultaneous\nor joint measurements, nor to any notion of accuracy like the\nresolving power of the measurement instrument, nor to the issue of how\nmuch the system in the state that is being measured is\ndisturbed by this measurement. This section is devoted to\nattempts that go beyond the mold of this preparation uncertain\nprinciple.\n",
