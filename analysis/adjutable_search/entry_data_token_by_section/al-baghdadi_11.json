    "main_text": "Good and bad Epistemologies and Practices || Medical Epistemology\n5.1 Medical Epistemology\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif in the first part of his above mentioned\nautobiographical work (Joosse 2011, 2014) focuses on the\nepistemological status of the art of medicine using different\ncomparisons which seem to be in contradiction: medicine is like both\nmathematics and the art of archery (Joosse & Pormann 2008).\nMedicine is an art concerned with universals. For this reason it does\nnot make errors. Mathematics is also a science which considers\nabstract concepts, but even in this theoretical science approximation\noccurs (the examples are that of the impossibility of squaring a\ncircle and the approximation in writing an irrational number).\nConcerning the physicians, they are like the expert in the art of\narchery \u201cwho hits the mark in most cases\u201d (Joosse 2014:\n66), but they can make mistakes because they are concerned with\nparticulars. Good physicians, even if they do not hit the target, do\nnot miss it entirely. For \u2018Abd al-Latif his contemporaries are\nlike those whose arrows which do not hit the targets, but on the\ncontrary, fall in the opposite direction (Joosse & Pormann\n2010).\n\nThe pitiful state of contemporary medicine, in contrast to the\nmedicine of the Ancients Hippocrates, Dioscorides and Galen, is caused\nfirst of all because the contemporaries do not follow a medical\nepistemology. \u2018Abd al-Latif observes that, even in antiquity,\nmedical sects had existed which taught false medicine. \u2018Abd\nal-Latif recalls, in particular, the Empirical and Methodist sects\nwhich were in opposition to the Dogmatic or Rationalist one, according\nto the classic tripartite division of medical schools which were known\nto Arabic authors due precisely to the Arabic translation of many\nintroductory works by Galen and pseudo-Galen. The Empirical sect of\nSceptical inspiration, in fact, was neither concerned to study the\nanatomical structure of the human body nor the internal secrets of\nillnesses. It rejected any possible analogy between the dead body and\nthe living body. It denied any general theory. The medicine which it\ntaught, therefore, translated itself into a medical practice totally\nalien to the anatomic-physiological basis of symptoms and was wholly\nlinked to clinical phenomena and the classification of symptoms and\nmedicines. The Methodist sect of Stoic and Epicurean inspiration, for\nwhich human life was the natural place for moral and physical\nsuffering, held that the human body was formed of atoms which could\nnot be perceived by the senses and which were in continual movement\nthrough pores and channels. According to this sect, illness came about\nin the case of an alteration in the quality and the movement of the\ncorpuscles or in the case of an excessive tightening or relaxing of\nthe pores through which the atoms moved. Therapy, therefore, was\nreduced to baths designed to provoke sweat in cases of the tightening\nof the pores and astringents and tonics in the case of dilation, in\norder to return to an intermediate perviousness. \u2018Abd al-Latif\nholds that the above sects are far removed from the medicine practiced\nby the Dogmatic doctors of Platonic and Aristotelian inspiration who\nconsidered anatomy and physiology to be the basic sciences and for\nwhom the detailed study of the internal causes of an illness was\nprimary and necessary. Nevertheless, the criteria followed by the\nEmpirical and the Methodist sects were thus far scientific: the\nphysicians followed a theory and did not proceed by pure and simple\nsupposition, as most contemporary physicians did (Joosse & Pormann\n2010).\n\nIn \u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s opinion, the medicine of his age must\nrediscover and apply Greek medicine with its principles, descriptions\nof diseases, and therapies. Greek theoretical medicine is concerned\nwith universals and is founded on the ground of universal principles\nwhich are valid everywhere. In this respect, according to him, Greek\nmedicine is far superior to his contemporaries\u2019 practice and\nmust be learned by the physicians of his age according to the\nprinciple of accumulation of knowledge which also guides \u2018Abd\nal-Latif\u2019s philosophical project.\n",
