    "main_text": "History of the Term and the Concept of Information || Classical Philosophy\n2.1 Classical Philosophy\n\nIn classical philosophy \u201cinformation\u201d was a technical\nnotion associated with a theory of knowledge and ontology that\noriginated in Plato\u2019s (427\u2013347 BCE) theory of forms,\ndeveloped in a number of his dialogues (Phaedo, Phaedrus,\nSymposium, Timaeus, Republic). Various imperfect individual\nhorses in the physical world could be identified as horses, because\nthey participated in the static atemporal and aspatial idea of\n\u201chorseness\u201d in the world of ideas or forms. When later\nauthors like Cicero (106\u201343 BCE) and Augustine (354\u2013430\nCE) discussed Platonic concepts in Latin they used the terms\ninformare and informatio as a translation for\ntechnical Greek terms like eidos (essence), idea\n(idea), typos (type), morphe (form) and\nprolepsis (representation). The root \u201cform\u201d still\nis recognizable in the word in-form-ation (Capurro &\nHj\u00f8rland 2003). Plato\u2019s theory of forms was an attempt to\nformulate a solution for various philosophical problems: the theory of\nforms mediates between a static (Parmenides, ca. 450 BCE) and a\ndynamic (Herakleitos, ca. 535\u2013475 BCE) ontological conception of\nreality and it offers a model to the study of the theory of human\nknowledge. According to Theophrastus (371\u2013287 BCE) the analogy\nof the wax tablet goes back to Democritos (ca. 460\u2013380/370 BCE)\n(De Sensibus 50). In the Theaetetus (191c,d) Plato\ncompares the function of our memory with a wax tablet in which our\nperceptions and thoughts are imprinted like a signet ring stamps\nimpressions in wax. Note that the metaphor of imprinting symbols in\nwax is essentially spatial (extensive) and can not easily be\nreconciled with the aspatial interpretation of ideas supported by\nPlato.\n\nOne gets a picture of the role the notion of \u201cform\u201d plays\nin classical methodology if one considers Aristotle\u2019s\n(384\u2013322 BCE) doctrine of the four causes. In Aristotelian\nmethodology understanding an object implied understanding four\ndifferent aspects of it:\n\n\nMaterial Cause:: that as the result of whose presence\nsomething comes into being\u2014e.g., the bronze of a statue and the\nsilver of a cup, and the classes which contain these\n\nFormal Cause:: the form or pattern; that is, the\nessential formula and the classes which contain it\u2014e.g., the\nratio 2:1 and number in general is the cause of the octave-and the\nparts of the formula.\n\nEfficient Cause:: the source of the first beginning\nof change or rest; e.g., the man who plans is a cause, and the father\nis the cause of the child, and in general that which produces is the\ncause of that which is produced, and that which changes of that which\nis changed.\n\nFinal Cause:: the same as \u201cend\u201d; i.e.,\nthe final cause; e.g., as the \u201cend\u201d of walking is health.\nFor why does a man walk? \u201cTo be healthy\u201d, we say, and by\nsaying this we consider that we have supplied the cause. (Aristotle,\nMetaphysics 1013a)\n\n\nNote that Aristotle, who rejects Plato\u2019s theory of forms as\natemporal aspatial entities, still uses \u201cform\u201d as a\ntechnical concept. This passage states that knowing the form or\nstructure of an object, i.e., the information, is a necessary\ncondition for understanding it. In this sense information is a crucial\naspect of classical epistemology.\n\nThe fact that the ratio 2:1 is cited as an example also illustrates\nthe deep connection between the notion of forms and the idea that the\nworld was governed by mathematical principles. Plato believed under\ninfluence of an older Pythagorean (Pythagoras 572\u2013ca. 500 BCE)\ntradition that \u201ceverything that emerges and happens in the\nworld\u201d could be measured by means of numbers (Politicus\n285a). On various occasions Aristotle mentions the fact that Plato\nassociated ideas with numbers (Vogel 1968: 139). Although formal\nmathematical theories about information only emerged in the twentieth\ncentury, and one has to be careful not to interpret the Greek notion\nof a number in any modern sense, the idea that information was\nessentially a mathematical notion, dates back to classical philosophy:\nthe form of an entity was conceived as a structure or pattern that\ncould be described in terms of numbers. Such a form had both an\nontological and an epistemological aspect: it explains the essence as\nwell as the understandability of the object. The concept of\ninformation thus from the very start of philosophical reflection was\nalready associated with epistemology, ontology and mathematics.\n\nTwo fundamental problems that are not explained by the classical\ntheory of ideas or forms are 1) the actual act of knowing an object\n(i.e., if I see a horse in what way is the idea of a horse activated\nin my mind) and 2) the process of thinking as manipulation of ideas.\nAristotle treats these issues in De Anime, invoking the\nsignet-ring-impression-in-wax analogy:\n\n\nBy a \u201csense\u201d is meant what has the power of receiving into\nitself the sensible forms of things without the matter. This must be\nconceived of as taking place in the way in which a piece of wax takes\non the impress of a signet-ring without the iron or gold; we say that\nwhat produces the impression is a signet of bronze or gold, but its\nparticular metallic constitution makes no difference: in a similar way\nthe sense is affected by what is coloured or flavoured or sounding,\nbut it is indifferent what in each case the substance is; what alone\nmatters is what quality it has, i.e., in what ratio its constituents\nare combined. (De Anime, Book II, Chp. 12)\n\nHave not we already disposed of the difficulty about interaction\ninvolving a common element, when we said that mind is in a sense\npotentially whatever is thinkable, though actually it is nothing until\nit has thought? What it thinks must be in it just as characters may be\nsaid to be on a writing-tablet on which as yet nothing actually stands\nwritten: this is exactly what happens with mind. (De Anime,\nBook III, Chp. 4)\n\n\nThese passages are rich in influential ideas and can with hindsight be\nread as programmatic for a philosophy of information: the process of\ninformatio can be conceived as the imprint of characters on a\nwax tablet (tabula rasa), thinking can be analyzed in terms\nof manipulation of symbols.\n",
