    "main_text": "The Paradoxes of Camus\u2019s Absurdist Philosophy\n1. The Paradoxes of Camus\u2019s Absurdist Philosophy\n\nThere are various paradoxical elements in Camus\u2019s approach to\nphilosophy. In his book-length essay, The Myth of Sisyphus,\nCamus presents a philosophy that contests philosophy itself. This\nessay belongs squarely in the philosophical tradition of\nexistentialism but Camus denied being an existentialist. Both The\nMyth of Sisyphus and his other philosophical work, The\nRebel, are systematically skeptical of conclusions about the\nmeaning of life, yet both works assert objectively valid answers to\nkey questions about how to live. Though Camus seemed modest when\ndescribing his intellectual ambitions, he was confident enough as a\nphilosopher to articulate not only his own philosophy but also a\ncritique of religion and a fundamental critique of modernity. While\nrejecting the very idea of a philosophical system, Camus constructed\nhis own original edifice of ideas around the key terms of absurdity\nand rebellion, aiming to resolve the life-or-death issues that\nmotivated him.\n\nThe essential paradox arising in Camus\u2019s philosophy concerns his\ncentral notion of absurdity. Accepting the Aristotelian idea that\nphilosophy begins in wonder, Camus argues that human beings cannot\nescape asking the question, \u201cWhat is the meaning of\nexistence?\u201d Camus, however, denies that there is an answer to\nthis question, and rejects every scientific, teleological,\nmetaphysical, or human-created end that would provide an adequate\nanswer. Thus, while accepting that human beings inevitably seek to\nunderstand life\u2019s purpose, Camus takes the skeptical position\nthat the natural world, the universe, and the human enterprise remains\nsilent about any such purpose. Since existence itself has no meaning,\nwe must learn to bear an irresolvable emptiness. This paradoxical\nsituation, then, between our impulse to ask ultimate questions and the\nimpossibility of achieving any adequate answer, is what Camus calls\nthe absurd. Camus\u2019s philosophy of the absurd explores\nthe consequences arising from this basic paradox.\n\nCamus\u2019s understanding of absurdity is best captured in an image,\nnot an argument: of Sisyphus straining to push his rock up the\nmountain, watching it roll down, then descending after the rock to\nbegin all over, in an endless cycle. Like Sisyphus, humans cannot help\nbut continue to ask after the meaning of life, only to see our answers\ntumble back down. If we accept this thesis about life\u2019s\nessential absurdity, and Camus\u2019s anti-philosophical approach to\nphilosophical questions, we cannot help but ask: What role is left for\nrational analysis and argument? Doesn\u2019t Camus the philosopher\npreside over the death of philosophy in answering the question whether\nto commit suicide by abandoning the terrain of argument and analysis\nand turning to metaphor to answer it? If life has no fundamental\npurpose or meaning that reason can articulate, we cannot help asking\nabout why we continue to live and to reason. Might not Silenus be\nright in declaring that it would have been better not to have been\nborn, or to die as soon as\n possible?[1]\n And, as Francis Jeanson wrote long before his famous criticism of\nThe Rebel that precipitated the rupture between Camus and\nSartre, isn\u2019t absurdist philosophy a contradiction in terms,\nstrictly speaking no philosophy at all but an anti-rational posture\nthat ends in silence (Jeanson 1947)?\n\nWas Camus actually a philosopher? He himself said no, in a famous\ninterview with Jeanine Delpech in Les Nouvelles\nLitt\u00e9raires in November of 1945, insisting that he did\n\u201cnot believe sufficiently in reason to believe in a\nsystem\u201d (Camus 1965, 1427). This was not merely a public\nposture, since we find the same thought in his notebooks of this\nperiod: he describes himself as an artist and not a philosopher\nbecause \u201cI think according to words and not according to\nideas\u201d (Camus 1995, 113). Still, Jean-Paul Sartre saw\nimmediately that Camus was undertaking important philosophical work,\nand in his review of The Stranger in relation to\nSisyphus, had no trouble connecting Camus with Pascal,\nRousseau, and Nietzsche (Sartre 1962). After they became friends\nSartre spoke publicly of his friend\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of the\nabsurd,\u201d which he distinguished from his own thought for which\nhe accepted the \u201cexistentialist\u201d label that Camus\nrejected. In the years since, the apparent unsystematic, indeed,\nanti-systematic, character of his philosophy, has meant that\nrelatively few scholars have appreciated its full depth and\ncomplexity. They have more often praised his towering literary\nachievements and standing as a political moralist while pointing out\nhis dubious claims and problematic arguments (see Sherman 2008). A\nsignificant recent exception to this is Ronald Srigley\u2019s\nAlbert Camus\u2019 Critique of Modernity (Srigley 2011).\n\nThis entry will negotiate Camus\u2019s deliberate ambivalence as a\nphilosopher while discussing his philosophy. It is not just a matter\nof giving a philosophical reading of this playwright, journalist,\nessayist, and novelist but of taking his philosophical writings\nseriously\u2014exploring their premises, their evolution, their\nstructure, and their coherence. To do so is to see that his writing\ncontains more than a mood and more than images and sweeping,\nunsupported assertions, although it contains many of both. Camus takes\nhis skepticism as far as possible as a form of methodical\ndoubt\u2014that is, he begins from a presumption of\nskepticism\u2014until he finds the basis for a non-skeptical\nconclusion. And he builds a unique philosophical construction, whose\npremises are often left unstated and which is not always argued\nclearly, but which develops in distinct stages over the course of his\nbrief lifetime. Camus\u2019s philosophy can be thus read as a\nsustained effort to demonstrate and not just assert what is entailed\nby the absurdity of human existence. In the process Camus answers the\nquestions posed by The Myth of Sisyphus, \u201cWhy should I\nnot kill myself?\u201d, and by The Rebel, \u201cWhy should\nI not kill others?\u201d\n",
