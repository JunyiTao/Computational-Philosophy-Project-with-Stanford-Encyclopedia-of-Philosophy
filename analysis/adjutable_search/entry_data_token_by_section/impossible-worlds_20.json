    "main_text": "Objections to Impossible Worlds || Counterpossible Reasoning\n6.5 Counterpossible Reasoning\n\nTimothy Williamson (2007, Chapter 5) has objected to non-trivial\ntreatments of counterpossibles, in particular (though not perforce)\nwhen they resort to impossible worlds. Consider the claim:\n\nIf \\(5 + 7\\) were 13, then \\(5 + 6\\) would be 12.\n\n\nPrima facie, this is a non-trivially true counterpossible.\nHowever, Williamson argues, other non-trivial consequences of the\nsupposition would then be that \\(5 + 5 = 11\\), and \\(5 + 4 = 10\\), and\n\u2026 , and \\(0 = 1\\). Therefore,\n\nIf the number of answers I gave to a given question were 0, then\nthe number of answers I gave would be 1.\n\n\nBut (2) is clearly false.\n\nBrogaard and Salerno (2007) pose a dilemma for Williamson: either we\nhold the context fixed in this kind of counterpossible reasoning, or\nwe don\u2019t. If we don\u2019t, then (2) does not follow from (1).\nIn particular, the context at which (2) comes out false is one at\nwhich the closest antecedent worlds are possible and, to be sure, at\nthose worlds, 0 is not 1. But if we hold the context fixed, then what\ndoes follow is just the following counterpossible:\n\nIf 0 were 1 and the number of right answers I gave were 0, then\nthe number of right answers I gave would be 1.\n\n\nNow this is intuitively true, and non-trivially so.\n\nWilliamson (2007) also argues that non-trivial treatments of\ncounterpossibles create opaque contexts, in which the substitutivity\nof co-referential terms fails. Supporters of non-trivial\ncounterpossibles will take the following conditional as false:\n\nIf Hesperus had not been Phosphorus, then Phosphorus would not\nhave been Phosphorus.\n\n\nGiven the necessity of identity, (4) is a counterpossible: as Hesperus\nis Phosphorus, its antecedent can only be true at impossible worlds.\nThat\u2019s false, supposedly, because even if Hesperus and\nPhosphorus had been distinct, Phosphorus would have remained\nself-identical. However, all accept that\n\nIf Hesperus had not been Phosphorus, then Hesperus would not have\nbeen Phosphorus\n\n\nsince it is an instance of \u2018if it had been that \\(A\\), then it\nwould have been that \\(A\\)\u2019. Yet substituting\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019 for the first occurrence of\n\u2018Hesperus\u2019 in the consequent of (5) gives (4). Since (5)\nis true and (4) is (supposedly) false, substitution of identicals has\nfailed. This failure of substitutivity, Williamson claims, is a bad\nresult, for counterfactuals should not create opaque\ncontexts.\n\nBrogaard and Salerno (2013) accept that counterpossibles do create\nopaque contexts. They argue that the impossible worlds similarity\nsemantics for counterpossibles should be \u201cpartially\nepistemic\u201d (Brogaard and Salerno 2013: 654), and this epistemic\ncomponent explains the failure of substitution.\n\nAn alternative reply to Williamson is that the objection is\nquestion-begging. It is clearly false that counterfactuals allow\nsubstitution of identical terms (of arbitrary type). \u2018Had\nAristotle never taught, Aristotle would still have been\nAristotle\u2019 is true, and Aristotle is the teacher of Alexander,\nyet \u2018had Aristotle never taught, Aristotle would still have been\nthe teacher of Alexander\u2019 is clearly false. The substitution\nprinciple must (at the least) be restricted to rigid\ndesignators: terms that denote the same entity in all\nmetaphysically possible worlds. But if the definition of\n\u2018rigid designator\u2019 is to be restricted to\npossible worlds, then the application of the corresponding\nsubstitution principle should likewise be restricted to contexts which\ndo not invoke impossible worlds. Viewed from this perspective, it is\nquestion-begging to insist at the outset that the substitution\nprinciple (for rigid designators) is valid for all counterfactuals\n(including counterpossibles).\n\nBerto et al. 2018 is an extensive discussion of a number of\nWilliamsonian objections to non-trivial treatments of\ncounterpossibles.\n",
