Philosophizings Born of Struggles: Conditions of Emergence of Africana Philosophy\n\n\nThe metaphilosophical efforts to map out and order a complex\ndiscursive field of articulations and practices as Africana\nphilosophy are, indeed, emergent disciplinary ventures of\nthe late twentieth century. However, many of the instances of\nthoughtful articulation and aesthetic expressiveness that are being\nidentified and explored as instances of philosophizing were neither\nproduced nor guided by norms and agendas of the discipline of academic\nphilosophy as institutionalized for centuries in various countries of\nWestern European and North America. The same is true for the needs,\nmotivations, objectives, and many of the principal intellectual\nresources that motivated and oriented those instances of articulation\nand creative expression and the formation of the networks of\nidea-spaces and discursive communities that nurtured them. For African\nand African-descended peoples were of little or no philosophical or\nanthropological significance to those who have been the designators,\nhistorians, practitioners, and mediators of the discipline\u2019s\ninstitutionalized canons of issues, figures, agendas, conceptual and\nmethodological traditions, problem-sets, texts or text-analogs,\norganizations, and institutions. The pre-Modern histories of African\nand African-descended peoples; the centuries-long colonized, enslaved,\nand otherwise utterly dehumanizing unfreedom of Black peoples\nthroughout the continents of Africa, Europe, the Americas, and the\nCaribbean; the rapacious unjust exploitation of their bodies, lands,\nresources, and life-opportunities\u2014all of these went mostly\nwithout explicit comment in the discipline of Philosophy, not even as a\nfocus of protest, notwithstanding all of the vaunted concern within the\ndiscipline for conceptions of freedom, justice,\nequality, human nature, and human well-being\ngenerally. Even as European and European-descended philosophes\nof the eighteen, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries fashion decidedly\nnew philosophical anthropologies, socio-political philosophies, and\nphilosophies of histories into complex Enlightenments to ground and\nguide quests to realize the global instantiations of Modernities in\nwhich reason-guided freedom and justice would be foundational to the\nspread of the racialized, capitalist civilizational projects of\nEurocentrism (Amin 1989), there was almost total silence about the intended and\nunintended consequences for peoples African and of African\ndescent\u2014except for claims that colonization and enslavement would\nbring them much needed \u201ccivilizing.\u201d\n\n\nEvolving academic, and subsequently professionalized, Philosophy\nthus aided and abetted, and was a substantial institutionalized\nbeneficiary of, these projects well into the twentieth century when the\nvarious forms and movements of resistance of African and\nAfrican-descended peoples to dehumanization were made more challenging\nwhile animated by motivating declarations of their claims to their\nhumanity and their rights to freedom, justice, and full citizenship. By\nthe middle of the twentieth century, throughout Africa, the Caribbean,\nand the Americas these movements had won major victories of liberation\nfrom the oppressive regimes of Eurocentric racial apartheid and\nexploitation. The movements were also contributing to progressive\ntransformations of these regimes that helped to open them to\nsubstantive measures of real freedom and justice not only for persons\nand peoples African and of African descent, but for other persons and\npeoples of color and, even, for women of European descent.\n\n\nThese historic movements and developments provided contemporary\npioneers of Africana philosophy rich, exemplary ideas, idea-spaces,\nagendas, and social networks on which to draw for motivations,\nmissions, and other resources to forge intellectual agendas and\nstrategies and social networks needed for philosophizing in the\ninterests of people African and of African descent. Hence, the\ntwentieth-century emergence of Africana philosophy as an international\nfield of and for discursive intellectual and expressive aesthetic work\nwith a distinctive mission: to gather up and explore critically\nthoughtful articulations and aesthetic expressions by and about persons\nand peoples African and of African descent as instances of\nphilosophizing; and to fashion revised or new articulations and artful\nexpressions in keeping with, and as aids to, quests for freedom,\njustice, and human dignity by and for these persons and peoples.\n\n\nExamples of such mission-driven creative intellectual and expressive\nwork in service to the liberation and redemption of Black peoples were\nalready at hand in several other disciplines: in history and sociology,\nmusic and literature, art and dance, religion and theology. Moreover,\noutside of academic disciplines, many among several generations of\nfiercely independent, extraordinarily formally and informally educated\n(and in some instances self-taught) socially, politically, and\naesthetically engaged female and male black intellectuals and artists,\nwho devoted much of their lives to service as uplifters of Black\npeoples, had pursued their often very highly productive, and certainly\nvery influential, intellectual and expressive work without ongoing\naffiliations with institutions of higher education, and without the\nassistance of sources of support for articulation and expression, that\nwere dominated and controlled by Europeans and people of European\ndescent. This independence was crucial to the production of their\nseminal reflections, articulations, and artistic creations and\nexpressions. Many of them helped to found and were affiliated with and\nsupported by religious and educational institutions, character-building\nwomen\u2019s and men\u2019s clubs and literary societies;\ninternational missionary ventures; benevolent and political\norganizations; publishing and commercial enterprises; and with local,\nregional, and international anti-colonial and liberatory organizations\nfounded and operated by and devoted to the uplift, freedom, and\nwell-being of African and African-descended peoples. As inspiring role\nmodels, much of their work became resource-reservoirs for new\ngenerations of women and men determined to continue the quests for\nliberation and justice for Black peoples. A matter of significant\ninfluence was that many of these important figures had become\ninternationalists in understanding the similarities and commonalities of\nthe plights suffered by African and African-descended peoples due to\nthe shared agendas for racialized oppression and exploitation forged\nand fostered by White peoples of various nation-states. Consequently,\nmore than a few of the new generations of twentieth-century African and\nAfrican-descended fighters for freedom and justice cultivated\ninternationalist, \u201cPan African\u201d (Geiss 1974) understandings of and\naspirations for what would be needed in the way of intellectual\nresources and strategies to assist with claiming and realizing the full\nhumanity of and just freedom for African and African-descended\npeoples.\n\n\nMany of the contemporary disciplinary pioneers of the\nphilosophizings that are now being gathered under the umbrella of\nAfricana philosophy, though participants in institutionalized,\nprofessional philosophy, have also been intellectual and spiritual\nmembers of the new generations of freedom fighters or otherwise\nsubstantially influenced by them. Thus, many have drawn their\nmotivations, aspirations, and resources for philosophical work from\nbeyond the canonized motivations and traditions of thought\ninstitutionalized in the discipline. Energized and emboldened by the\nlegacies of the role models and liberatory movements, they have taken\non the work of challenging the discipline in order to create room\nwithin its intellectual and organizational structures and processes\nwherein they could pursue agendas of giving consideration to matters of\nphilosophical import to persons and peoples African and of African\ndescent, and of particular import to themselves as persons African and\nof African descent engaged in philosophizing formally and\nprofessionally.\n\n\nAmong the challenges was the need, first, to reconsider\nlong-prevailing defining assumptions regarding the nature of properly\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d thought: namely, that such thought is\ncharacterized by a loving quest for wisdom pursued by persons who have\nthe most highly cultivated forms of disciplined thought, and whose\nlives are materially conditioned such that they have the leisure to\ndevote substantial amounts of their time and energy to reflective\nthought and to working out their thinking for articulate,\nsystematic expression in writing.\n\n\nIt became apparent to many\u2014though by no means to all\u2014of\nthe contemporary pioneers of Africana philosophy within academic\nphilosophy that this image of the ideal philosopher was not appropriate\nfor respectfully identifying or characterizing many of the\nphilosophically thoughtful and expressive persons African and of\nAfrican descent, those, especially, who lived several centuries ago.\nCertainly, throughout the centuries of radically disruptive and\ndehumanizing encounters between peoples African and of African descent\nand peoples of Europe and of the Euro-Americas, and others, the\nphilosophizing efforts of Black people have, indeed, been \u201cborn\nof struggle,\u201d as the philosopher Leonard Harris has so aptly\nnoted. The experiences, thus the philosophizing, of many of these\npersons\u2014and of generations of millions who were their\ncontemporaries, millions more who came before them, and millions more\nwho came after them\u2014were conditioned profoundly by racialized and\ngendered exploitative settler-colonialism in their homelands; for\nothers by racialized and gendered capture, relocation, enslavement, and\noppression in The New World thousands of miles from their or\ntheir ancestors\u2019 homelands; and in all such cases by racialized\nand gendered imperialist encroachments on the very core of their\nbeing by which they were forced to become and to be colonized\n\u201cnatives\u201d and slaves, ontologically as well as\nsocio-economically. Survival and endurance of such conditions by those\nwho managed to do so required coordinated efforts of recovery and\nretention, or the recreation, of the integrity of personhood and\npeoplehood, even of basic humaneness, thus required thoughtful\nontological and political work of the most fundamental significance.\nSo, too, crucial intellectual efforts of the kinds designated moral,\nethical, epistemological, social, religious, theological, and\naesthetic.\n\n\nThus, survival and endurance of conditions of racialized and\ngendered colonization, enslavement, and oppression\u2014not conditions\nof leisured freedom\u2014compelled more than a few African\nand African-descended persons to philosophize. Almost daily, even on\nwhat seemed the most mundane of occasions, oppressed Black people were\ncompelled to consider the most fundamental existential\nquestions: Continue life during what would turn out to be\ncenturies-long colonization and enslavement, of brutal, brutalizing and\nhumiliating gendered and racialized oppression? Or, seek\n\u201cfreedom\u201d in death? Suffer despair until mad? Or, find\nresources for continued living through surreptitiously nurtured\nappreciations of the sacred and beautiful, of irony and tragic comedy,\nwhile cultivating hope and patience aided by discoveries and creations\nof beauty and humaneness in the midst of the physical and\nsoul-distorting psychological brutalities of enforced impoverishments\nof conditions that were not in any way \u201cmundane\u201d living?\nDie at one\u2019s own initiation? Or, capitulate to dehumanization?\nOr, struggle to find and sustain faith and hope for a better life, on\nearth as well as in the afterlife, through creativity and beauty in\nspeech, dance, and song while at work and rest; in thought and\nartistry; in finding and making truth and right; in seeking and doing\njustice; in forging and sustaining relations of family and community\nwhen such relations were largely prohibited; in rendering life\nsacred?\n\n\nFor centuries, persons African and of African descent, for\nthemselves as well as for their associates and successors, have\nhad to ponder the most fundamental questions of existence as a\ndirect consequence of their life-constraining, life-distorting\nencounters with various self-racializing and other-racializing peoples\nof Europe, the Euro-Americas, and elsewhere. And in choosing to live\nand endure, peoples African and of African descent have had to\nforge, test out with their lives, and then refine and further live out\nexplicit strategies by which to avoid being broken by brutality and\nhumiliation and succumbing to fear, despair, or the soul-devouring\nobsession with vengeance. They have had to share with their\nassociates, and those succeeding them, their creative and sustaining\nlegacies for infusing life with spirit-lifting artfulness and their\narticulated ponderings and strategies for surviving, living, and\nenduring with hope despite the circumstances. They have\nhad to philosophize, and to share their philosophizings, in\norder to forge the cross-generational bonds of respectful,\nextended-family, community-sustaining love and mutuality without which\nneither survival nor endurance would have been possible.\n\n\nIndeed, endurance of gendered and racialized colonization,\nenslavement, and oppression that would be continued for centuries\nrequired very compelling, sustaining, persuasive beliefs and nurtured\ninvestments in finding and creating soul-nurturing art and\nexperience-verified praxis-guiding thoughtfulness. These beliefs and\naesthetic considerations had to be articulated and communicated for\nsharing, sometimes surreptitiously, in order that persons and peoples\nendure. And enduring required that the brutalities and humiliations had\nto be countered that were directed, first and foremost, at the defining\ncore of their very being\u2014that is, at their foundational\nnotions of themselves as persons and as distinctive, racialized\npeoples\u2014so as to bring about their cross-generational living of\nsocial death (Patterson 1982). This particular persons did, throughout Africa\nand African Diasporas, and without either the guidance or sanction of\nacademic Philosophy and the discipline\u2019s most canonical\npractitioners even as some among the latter subjected African and\nAfrican-descended peoples to their ontological racism.\n\n\nIt has been instances of such compelled, articulated thoughtfulness\nthat contemporary proponents of Africana philosophy have brought into\nthe discipline of academic Philosophy as the initial historic instances\nof philosophizing constituting the new field. The identification and\ncareful exploration of and commentary on the forms and efficacies of\nthis growing collection of works of thoughtful articulation and\naesthetic expression are now principal forms of endeavor in Africana\nphilosophy. The creation and expression of new articulations and\nexpressions of thoughtfulness by persons African and of African\ndescent, and by other philosophers not African or of African descent,\non these works as well as on old, continuing, or emergent issues\npertinent to Africans and people of African descent make for other\nforms of endeavor in Africana philosophy.\n\n\nThese efforts of recovery, exploration, commentary, and critique\nconstitute an ongoing project-of-projects with several agendas. A first\nagenda involves, as just noted, the identification and recovery of\ninstances and legacies of the \u2018philosophizings born of\nstruggles\u2019. Another very important agenda is the identification\nand recovery of philosophizings that were engaged in long before the\ncenturies-long struggles with peoples of Europe began. A third agenda\nis to learn from the philosophizings the lessons of the considerations\nthat governed or substantially conditioned the organization and living\nof life in the various circumstances in which peoples of Africa forged\ntheir evolutionary adaptations. Another agenda: to understand and\nappreciate fully those philosophizings that nurtured endurance in the\nface of brutalizing assaults on peoples\u2019 being in order\nto learn from the life-affirming, very passionate intellectual and\nemotional endeavors of those among severely abused peoples who have\nbeen, and continue to be, those who work at gathering themselves, their\npeoples, and even those who have abused them into humane integrity,\nindividually and collectively. It is to learn how and why it was and is\nthat from among peoples abused and degraded for centuries in conditions\nof continuous terrorism there have been steady successions of persons\nwho have spared substantial portions of the emotional and intellectual\nenergies they managed to preserve and cultivate, along with nurtured\nsenses of their sacred humanity, to devote to quests for freedom and\njustice, hardly ever to quests for vengeance.\n\n\nYet another agenda is to compare the philosophizings of persons\nAfrican and of African descent intra-racially and inter-racially, as it\nwere\u2014that is, to seek out the similarities and differences in the\nvarious instances and modes of thought and expression of persons\nsituated in similar and different times and places in order to learn\nmore about the forms and agendas of human species-being as manifested\nin philosophizing. An important consequence of pursuing this agenda\nshould be significant contributions to inventories of thoughtfulness\nand aesthetic expression in the storehouses of human civilizations,\ncontributions to the enlargement and enrichment of canons of Philosophy,\nand contributions to revisions of histories and of historiography in the\ndiscipline.\n\n\nStill another agenda is to make of Africana philosophy a collection\nof resources that inspire philosophizing, now and in the future, and\nthat guide such philosophizings by the best lessons found in the\ncollection, among them lessons in how to gain and sustain integrity of\nbody and soul, of person, of womanhood and manhood, of childhood and\nyoung-adulthood, of family and community, of \u201cracial\u201d and\ncultural being, of belief in the sacred sanctity of truth, of justice,\nand of freedom through the exercise of faith and\nhope-sustaining, pragmatically focused reasoning and creative\naesthetic expression in cross-generational conditions of\ndehumanizing brutality. Among the lessons to be relearned: how\nnot to abuse persons and peoples; how not to\nrationalize abuse; how not to live massive lies and\ncontradictions and lives of hypocrisy.\n\n\nWhat follows are brief surveys of several historically contextualized\ndevelopments of philosophizing now being explored as instances of the\nphilosophizing constitutive of the field of \u201cAfricana\nphilosophy.\u201d The survey is not meant to be exhaustive, but one\nthat provides examples and solicits additional contributions in order\nto make the account more comprehensive and accurate.\n",
