    "main_text": "\n\nThought experiments are basically devices of the imagination. They are\nemployed for various purposes such an entertainment, education,\nconceptual analysis, exploration, hypothesizing, theory selection,\ntheory implementation, etc. Some applications are more controversial\nthan others. Few would object to thought experiments that serve to\nillustrate complex states of affairs, or those that are used in\neducational contexts. The situation is different, however, with\nrespect to the appropriation of imagined scenarios to investigate\nreality (very broadly conceived to include things like electrons,\ntables, rain, beliefs, morals, people, numbers, universes, and even\ndivine beings). It is this use of thought experiments that attracts\nmost of the attention inside and outside of philosophical discourse.\nSignificant is the overlap here with many other central philosophical\ntopics, such as the nature of the imagination, the importance of\nunderstanding in contrast to explanation, the role of intuition in\nhuman cognition, and the relationship between fiction and truth.\nMoreover, thought experiments are interdisciplinary in two important\nrespects. Firstly, not only philosophers study them as a research\ntopic, but also historians, cognitive scientists, psychologists, etc.\nSecondly, they are used in many disciplines, including biology,\neconomics, history, mathematics, philosophy, and physics (although,\ninterestingly, not with the same frequency in each).\n\nMost often thought experiments are communicated in narrative form,\nfrequently with diagrams. It is important to distinguish between the\nimagined scenarios that are featured in thought experiments, on the\none hand, and the narratives that establish those scenarios in\npeople\u2019s mind, on the other. Once a scenario is imagined it may\nassume a life on its own, and this explains partly the creative power\nof a good thought experiment. Experimental results may obtain that\nactually run counter to the narrative that initiated the discussion of\nan imagined scenario. Besides, thought experiments should be\ndistinguished from thinking about experiments, from merely imagining\nany experiments to be conducted outside the imagination, and from\npsychological experiments with thoughts, though there may be some\noverlap. They should also be distinguished from counterfactual\nreasoning in general, as they seem to require a palpable element,\nwhich explains the impression that something is experienced in a\nthought experiment (i.e., being seen, felt, heard, etc.; not\nliterally, of course). In other words, though many call any\ncounterfactual or hypothetical situation a thought experiment (see,\ne.g., Rescher 1991), this appears too encompassing.\n\nIt is a quite different matter as to whether there is a logical\nstructure common to all of thought experiments. Based on such\nconsiderations of logical structure, a taxonomy has been proposed\naccording to which all thought experiments fall into two classes:\n\u201cNecessity Refuters\u201d and \u201cPossibility\nRefuters\u201d (see Sorensen 1992, 132\u2013160). Such proposals\nespecially fuel the debate about identity conditions of thought\nexperiments. What modifications to logical structure does a thought\nexperiment tolerate before it ceases to exist and a new one is born?\nIn other words, how much emphasis on propositional characteristics is\nappropriate in the analysis of thought experiments?\n\nLooking at the development of the discussion about thought experiments\nover the past thirty years, it is fair to say that thought experiments\nwere primarily an important topic in the philosophy of science and the\nphilosophy of philosophy (\u201cmetaphilosophy\u201d), before the\nscope widened up at a later point. There is a simple reason for that\npath. At the core of the discussion sits a relatively simple\nepistemological challenge that is presented in a particularly powerful\nmanner by numerous thought experiments that the history of science has\nto offer. They suggest that we can learn about the real world by\nvirtue of merely thinking about imagined scenarios. But how can we\nlearn about reality (if we can at all), just by thinking? This is the\ncentral question. Are there really thought experiments that enable us\nto acquire new knowledge about nature without new empirical data? If\nso, where does the new information come from, assuming that it takes\nnew information to learn anything new about the world by means of\nthought experiments? Finally, how can we distinguish good from bad\ninstances of thought experiments? These questions seem urgent with\nrespect to scientific thought experiments, because many\n\u201crecognize them as an occasionally potent tool for increasing\nour understanding of nature\u201d (Kuhn 1977, p. 241).\n\u201cHistorically their role is very close to the double one played\nby actual laboratory experiments and observations. First, thought\nexperiments can disclose nature\u2019s failure to conform to a\npreviously held set of expectations. Second, they can suggest\nparticular ways in which both expectation and theory must henceforth\nbe revised\u201d (Kuhn 1977, p. 261). Yet, questions surrounding the\nepistemological challenge that certain scientific thought experiments\npose, are equally urgent with respect to thought experiments outside\nof the natural sciences. This is especially true with respect to\nphilosophy itself. Philosophy offers numerous examples of thought\nexperiments that play a role similar in importance to some scientific\nthought experiments. And this fact provokes in turn further inquiries\ninto the relationship between the natural sciences and philosophy,\nespecially with respect to phenomena that implicate both the natural\nsciences and philosophy, such as the mind and free will (see, e.g.,\nWilkes 1988; Young 2013).\n\nIf scientific practice has room for thought experiments, then the\nquestion arises as to why we would want philosophical methodology to\nbe more discriminatory in this respect. One reason that is often\noffered is that results of scientific thought experiments may be\nsubjected to further empirical testing. Obviously, this can\u2019t be\ndone for philosophical thought experiments. But, it seems difficult to\naccept a categorical separation of science and philosophy along these\nlines. The 17th century saw some of the most brilliant practitioners\nof thought experimentation in Galileo, Descartes, Newton, and Leibniz,\nall of whom pursued the project of \u201cnatural philosophy.\u201d\nAnd in our own time, the creation of quantum mechanics and relativity\nare almost unthinkable without the crucial role played by thought\nexperiments, most of which relate to important philosophical issues\nthat arise from these scientific theories. Besides, much of ethics,\nphilosophy of language, and philosophy of mind is based on the results\nof thought experiments in a way that seems very similar to scientific\nthought experiments (though some might contest this), including\nSearle\u2019s Chinese room, Putnam\u2019s twin earth, and\nJackson\u2019s Mary the colour scientist. Philosophy, even more than\nthe sciences, would be severely impoverished without thought\nexperiments. These observations partly explain why it has been argued\nthat a more \u201cunified\u201d account of thought experiments is\ndesirable (see Boniolo 1997; Cooper 2005, pp. 329\u2013330;\nG\u00e4hde 2000). Of course, it is important not to downplay the\nsignificant differences between the sciences and philosophy. But an\naccount of thought experiments seems more powerful if it can do\njustice to the fact that not only in the sciences we find many of\nthem.\n\nThere have been several attempts to define \u201cthought\nexperiment\u201d along the lines of traditional conceptual analysis\n(see, e.g., Picha 2011; McComb 2013), but likely it will be better to\nleave the term loosely characterized, so as not to prejudice the\nongoing investigation. Of course, we need to have some idea as to what\nthought experiments are to guide a proper philosophical analysis (see\nH\u00e4ggqvist 2009), but this does not mean that we need to begin\nwith a technical definition, specifying necessary and sufficient\nconditions. In fact, many of the most important concepts we deal with\nremain rather loosely defined when philosophical inquiry begins, e.g.,\nreligion or democracy. Luckily, there are plenty of examples to refer\nto in order to circumscribe our subject matter well enough. As well as\nthose already mentioned, there are Newton\u2019s bucket,\nHeisenberg\u2019s gamma-ray microscope, Einstein\u2019s elevator,\nLeibniz\u2019s mill, Parfit\u2019s people who split like amoebas,\nand Thomson\u2019s violinist. Everyone is probably familiar with some\nof these. Less familiar thought experiments include the mouse that\nbreaks into the tabernacle of a medieval Roman Catholic Church\nbuilding to feed on the consecrated wafers kept in there (see Fehige\n2018). Roman Catholic Christians believe that a consecrated wafer is\nthe \u201cbody of Christ\u201d. The \u201csubstance\u201d of the\nwafer, understood in terms of Aristotelian categories, is believed to\nbe replaced. In its place is the \u201csubstance\u201d of\nChrist\u2019s body after consecration by a priest. Only the\nAristotelian \u201caccidents\u201d of the wafer remain intact\n(smell, colour, texture, etc.). Does the mouse eat the \u201cbody of\nChrist\u201d (if any human actually does)? If not, then the\n\u201cbody of Christ\u201d seems to be less than an objective\nreality; if yes, the \u201cbody of Christ\u201d must be able to do\ngood in the absence of a believing human soul. Another example less\nknown is \u201cthe dome\u201d thought experiment, which is to prove\nindeterminism in Newtonian physics. Imagine a mass sitting on a\nradially symmetric surface in a gravitational field. Guided by\nNewton\u2019s laws of motion one comes to realize that the mass can\neither remain at rest for all times, or spontaneously move in an\narbitrary direction (see Norton 2008). This thought experiment\ntriggers a number of very interesting questions concerning the nature\nof Newtonian theory, the meaning of \u201cphysical\u201d, and the\nrole of idealizations in physics. And, of course, does it show what it\nclaims? (see Malament 2008).\n\nThis entry continues with an overview of the characteristics of\nthought experiments in light of examples in Section 1. Section 2\nreviews several taxonomies for classfying thought experiments and\nSection 3 sketches a history of philosophical inquiry into the nature\nof thought experiments. Section 4 covers several views representing\nthe current state of the debate. The entry concludes by highlighting\nsome trends in discussions surrounding the so-called laboratory of the\nmind.\n",
