The most prominent argument against reductionism stems\nfrom the observation that straightforward reductions hardly ever\noccur. Hence, reductionism cannot be regarded as yielding a coherent\npicture of what actually goes on in science. As long as reductionism\nis supposed to be more than a purely metaphysical position and is\nintended to say something significant about scientific change or\nnorms, the value and relevance of the notion of reduction seems to\ndepend in part upon how well the reductionist positions fit the facts,\nwhich their critics argue they do not (see, for example, Sarkar 1992;\nScerri & McIntyre 1997).\n\nProponents of reduction have responded in different ways. Some have\nsuggested more flexible and liberal interpretations of reduction\n(Wimsatt 1976; Schaffner 1993; Dizadji-Bahmani et al. 2010), to ensure\nthat the term \u2018reduction\u2019 still serves a purpose in\ndescribing actual scientific practice. A case in point is\nSchaffner\u2019s suggestion (Schaffner 2006&2012) that we should\nreconsider the relevance of merely partial reductions or of scientific\nexplanations, broadly construed, that are reductionist in spirit,\ndespite the fact that they do not comply with more traditional\nstandards of full-fledged theory-reductions (see also Winther\n2009).\n\nOthers have opted for a more radical stance: Bickle has recently\nsuggested that philosophical theorizing about reduction should best be\nconstrued as reconstructing whatever cases scientists judge to be\nreductions (Bickle 2008).\n\nA much more modest position consists in the idea that, though\nstraightforward reductions might be rare, reductionism might play a\nrole as a regulative ideal (Schaffner 1993); the notion of reduction\ncan, on this view, be used to characterize one extreme of a spectrum\nof possible relations between different stages of scientific\ndevelopments. It comes with a specific normative power: If a reduction\ncan be effected, it should be effected.\n\nIn addition, the notion of reduction obviously plays an important role\nin the characterization of non-reductive physicalism; a careful\ninvestigation of what reductionism consists in is required to\nadequately determine in what respects, if any, a theory of mind could\nbe coherently both non-reductivist and materialist about the\nmental.\n\nFinally, the concept obviously plays an important role in the field of\nmetaphysics which often extends far into the realm of possibilities.\nEven if reductionism should fail to apply to our world and our\nscientific history, it might be of interest to consider what reality\nwould be like in other worlds where reductionism does hold, worlds\nsimilar to ours in containing many different theories or conceptual\nframeworks but ones tied together by reductive links.\n\nThe hope that the actual progress of science can be successfully\ndescribed in terms of reduction has vanished. Concepts of reduction,\nexcept for those re-adapted to actual scientific practice, are\nnowadays studied primarily in the more theoretically oriented parts of\nthe metaphysics of science.\n\nStill, the question of what the concept of reduction amounts to can be\nsatisfactorily answered even if no theory actually reduces to any\nother theory and no property reduces to any other property. Answering\nthis question may serve two closely related purposes. First, a precise\ncharacterization of what reduction is supposed to consist in will help\njudging whether or not a given theory, such as folk psychology, or a\ngiven property, such as being in pain, actually reduce to their neural\ncounterparts. Secondly, an appropriate definition of reduction is\ncalled for when it comes to evaluating anti-reductionist\npositions.\n\nAs we have seen, reduction has been conceived of as a relation that\nprimarily holds between theories, properties, substances, concepts, or\nevents. It has been described as an explanatory relation that can be\ncashed out in terms of derivation, and it could be tied to mechanistic\nor ontological dependence, supervenience and identity. It has been\nargued that theory-reduction is prior to ontological reduction; and it\nhas been argued that ontological reduction is more fundamental than\ntheory reduction. Reduction has been couched in structuralist,\nempiricist and functionalist frameworks, and it has been one of the\ncore notions of theories defending one form or another of scientific\nunification. Most philosophers have abandoned this latter view. But\neven if the outlook for strong general reductionism, a form of\nreductionism that amounts to scientific as well as ontological unity\nmight be dim, exploring the question of what it takes for a property\nor theory to reduce to another property or theory will help not only\nunderstand what the search for unity consists in, a search that\ndominated large parts of the philosophy of science in the last\ncentury; it will also help judging and understanding its rivals, such\nas non-reductive physicalism, versions of dualism, or even the\nrecently defended rainforest pluralism (Wimsatt 1994). If we know the\nconditions imposed by the reduction relation on pairs of theories or\nproperties, we will also know what these anti-reductionist theories\nare bound to deny.\n",
