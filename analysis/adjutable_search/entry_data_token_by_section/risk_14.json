    "main_text": "Risk in economic analysis || Measures of economic risks\n7.1 Measures of economic risks\n\nPortfolio analysis, which was developed in the 1950s by Harry\nMarkowitz (1952), James Tobin (1958) and others, was an important step\nforward in the economic analysis of risk. These authors employed a\nsimple statistical measure, namely the standard deviation (or\nalternatively the variance, that is the square of the standard\ndeviation) as a measure of riskiness. Hence, in a comparison between\ntwo investment alternatives, the one whose economic outcome is\ncalculated to have the largest standard deviation is regarded as the\nmost risky one. In a comparison between different such alternatives,\neach of them can be characterized by two numbers, namely its\nexpectation value and its standard deviation or riskiness. Investors\ntypically prefer investments with as high expectation values and as\nlow riskiness as possible. However, investors differ in the relative\nweight that they assign to expectations respectively risk avoidance.\nGiven these decision weights, an individual\u2019s optimal portfolio\ncan be determined.\n\nSince the late 1960s, alternative measures of risk have been\ndeveloped. Perhaps the most influential of these was provided by\nMichael Rothschild and Joseph Stiglitz (1970): If we move probability\nmass from the centre to the tails of a probability distribution, while\nkeeping its mean unchanged, then we increase the risk associated with\nthe distribution. A measure based on this principle (mean preserving\nspread) can be constructed that has more attractive mathematical\nproperties than those of the older standard deviation measure.\n",
