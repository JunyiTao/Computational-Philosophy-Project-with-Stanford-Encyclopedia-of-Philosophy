    "main_text": "The Arguments for Occasionalism || The No Knowledge Argument\n3.2 The No Knowledge Argument\n\nThe \u201cno knowledge\u201d (hereafter \u201cNK\u201d) argument\naims to secure the occasionalist conclusion by presenting an\nintriguing, if controversial, epistemic condition on causal\n agency.[19]\n As noted earlier, Geulincx had argued that \u201cyou are not the\ncause of that which you do not know how to bring about\u201d\n(MV 2 150\u20131). Malebranche presents his version of the\nargument in numerous places, including the following passage from the\nElucidations, where he denies that our minds are true causes,\nbased on our lack of knowledge of the intended effects:\n\nBut I deny that my will is the true cause of my arm\u2019s movement,\nof my mind\u2019s ideas, and of other things accompanying my\nvolitions, for I see no relation whatever between such different\nthings. I even see clearly that there can be no relation between the\nvolition I have to move my arm and the agitation of the animal\nspirits, i.e., of certain tiny bodies whose motion and figure I do not\nknow and which choose certain nerve canals from a million others I do\nnot know in order to cause in me the motion I desire through an\ninfinity of movements I do not desire. (OCM III\n226/Search 669)\n\n\nThough not explicitly stated, many commentators have read Malebranche\nas endorsing, in places such as this passage, the claim that the agent\nmust know how to bring about the effect in order to be its\ncause.\n\nThis \u201cknowledge principle\u201d (hereafter \u201cKP\u201d)\nraises a number of questions. One question concerns the scope of its\napplicability. For the principle to be plausible, it might be thought,\none ought to restrict it to intelligent, volitional agents. As long as\nwe accept the traditional conception of the will as being\n\u201cblind\u201d on its own and dependent on the guidance of the\nintellect, we might think that there is something to be said for the\nclaim that we can only bring about what we know. That is, bringing\nabout a volitional effect seems to presuppose our intending the\neffect, and we seem to intend only what we, through our intellect,\nactually represent or know. While most commentators seem to favor\nreading Malebranche as restricting the knowledge principle to minds,\nthere is, as Steven Nadler has argued, at least one passage that seems\nto suggest that Malebranche is endorsing the wide scope applicability\nof KP (Conversations Chr\u00e9tiennes, OCM 4:15\u20136).\nAnd, as Nadler has also pointed out, Geulincx and some Islamic\noccasionalists indeed pressed the view that the principle applies\nubiquitously to all cases of genuine efficacy (Nadler 1999,\n263\u201374).\n\nIf Geulincx and Al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b (and, arguably, even Malebranche)\ndid hold KP to be applicable to chairs and rocks as well as thinking\nsubstances, our next question then is why they would hold such a\ncounter-intuitive view. Nadler has made the interesting suggestion\nthat the wide-scope application of KP could have been motivated by the\nview that takes \u201cvolitional agency to be the paradigm\nof causality\u201d (Nadler 1999, 270). Why take volitional agency to\nbe paradigmatic? According to Nadler, the critical link is divine\ncausal activity, which was the paradigmatic case of causality for the\noccasionalists in question. For if we take God\u2019s causal activity\nto be fundamentally intentional and volitional in character, then it\nseems indeed a short step to taking volitional agency to be also\nparadigmatic of causality.\n\nThat the occasionalist would take divine causality to be the paradigm\ncase, of course, is no surprise, and this might indeed explain why\nGeulincx and Al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b held the wide-scope view. For, if\nthey further assumed that all cases of genuine causation resemble the\nparadigmatic case of causation in this way, then insofar as KP is a\ncritical feature of divine causality, they would think that KP should\nbe satisfied in all cases of creaturely causation. This last\nassumption, however, is not trivial. For one wonders whether\ncreaturely causation ought to resemble divine causation in this\nrespect. Consider the fact that not all the features of the\nparadigmatic divine substance are replicated in created substances.\nFor instance, knowledge and intentionality are key divine features\nthat are not present in bodily substances. But this absence does not\nprevent extended substances from being the substances they are. But if\nknowledge and intentionality are not necessary for substancehood, as\nis the case for bodies, we might wonder whether they are necessary for\ncausal activity in bodies.\n\nThe second question about KP concerns the plausibility of the\nprinciple itself. Even if we just consider the best case\nscenarios\u2014that is, when its application is restricted to\nthinking substances\u2014it is not obvious that KP is without\nproblems. As mentioned earlier, on the assumption that volitional\npower is blind, the requirement that the intentional agent possess\nsome degree of knowledge of the effect does not seem completely\nimplausible in and of itself. The key issue, however, concerns the\nlevel of detail in the description of the intended outcome that is\nrequired for KP to be satisfied. For instance, returning to\nMalebranche\u2019s example, when I intentionally will to raise my\narm, I do seem to represent the outcome of my arm going up, insofar as\nthe description of this outcome is left at a fairly general level. It\nis obvious, however, that I do not have knowledge of the outcome, if\nthe description of the outcome is at the level of detail that\nMalebranche wants it to be, such that it would involve the movements\nof the minute components of my arm, such as the minute organic matter\nmaking up the muscle, nerves, bones, etc. So depending on the level of\ndescription, one might think that I do satisfy KP. For the NK argument\nto work, then, Malebranche has to restrict the description of outcomes\nin KP to the highest level of detail. And it is not clear that\nMalebranche can provide non-question begging reasons to support this\nrestriction.\n",
