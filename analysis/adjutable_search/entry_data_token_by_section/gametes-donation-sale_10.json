    "main_text": "Donor Anonymity || Fundamental Rights\n2.4 Fundamental Rights\n\nThe arguments against donor anonymity considered thus far focus on\nharms that might arise as a result of the practice. Another kind of\nargument is that individuals have a fundamental right to knowledge\nabout their origins. In the legal literature, some have argued that\nthe UN\u2019s Declaration on The Rights of The Child and the European\nConvention on Human Rights establishes individuals\u2019 rights to\ninformation about the circumstances of their conception, including\ninformation about their progenitors (Blyth & Farrand 2004). Apart\nfrom appeals to such declarations of rights, some attempts have been\nmade to motivate recognition of a fundamental right to know via appeal\nto other fundamental goods.\n\nOne strategy is to tie the right to know to the right to an identity.\nHere the argument is that individuals require genuine facts about\ntheir biological history in order to develop a proper personal\nidentity (Ravitsky 2010). However, one response is that while\nchildren have a right to an identity, they do not have a right to a\nparticular kind of identity, such as one based primarily on\nhistorical biological ties (Allen 1996). Another route is to argue\nthat children have a right to be respected, and that hiding facts\nabout their origins is a form of deception that we ought not permit\n(Freeman 1996). However, deception about origins is only a severe form\nof disrespect if we think that biological ties are important in the\nfirst place, and thus this argument risks begging the question.\n",
