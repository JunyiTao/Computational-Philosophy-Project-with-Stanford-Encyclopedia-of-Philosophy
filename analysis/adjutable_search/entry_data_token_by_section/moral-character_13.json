    "main_text": "Moral character and empirical studies || The challenge posed by situationism\n5.1 The challenge posed by situationism\n\nThis section will begin with a brief discussion of some recent\nphilosophical work on character that relies on results in experimental\nsocial psychology. This philosophical work calls into question the\nconceptions of character and virtue that are of concern especially to\nthe ancient Greek moralists and to contemporary philosophers whose\nwork derives from ancient views. Philosophers impressed by this\ntradition in experimental social psychology \u2013 which is often\nlabeled \u201csituationism\u201d\u2013 have denied that traits of\ncharacter are stable, consistent, or evaluatively integrated in the\nway that ancient or contemporary philosophers suggest. The ancient\nmoralists assumed that virtues are, in John Doris\u2019s description,\n\u201crobust traits: if a person has a robust trait, they\ncan be confidently expected to display trait-relevant behavior across\na wide variety of trait-relevant situations, even where some or all of\nthese situations are not optimally conducive to such behavior\u201d\n(2002, 18). Doris and others argue that traits are not robust in this\nsense. They are not stable or consistent and are wrongly invoked to\nexplain why people act as they do. Rather, these philosophers argue,\nand as the experimental tradition indicates, much of human behavior is\nattributable to seemingly trivial features of the situations in which\npersons find themselves. Hence the appropriateness of the label\n\u201csituationist\u201d for the philosophers espousing these views.\nFor variations on this view, see Harman (1999, 2000), Doris (2002),\nand Vranas (2005). \n\nIt is beyond the scope of this entry to discuss this work in detail.\nSome summary remarks, however, are in order. (For a detailed\ndiscussion, see the entries on\n empirical approaches to moral character,\n section 1, and\n moral psychology: empirical approaches,\n section 4.)\n\nSkepticism about robust traits of character emerges from some famous\nexperiments in social psychology. For example, in one experiment\npersons who found a dime in a phone booth were far more likely to help\na confederate who dropped some papers than were those who did not find\na dime. Another experiment involved seminary students who agreed to\ngive a talk on the importance of helping those in need. On the way to\nthe building where their talks were to be given, they encountered a\nconfederate slumped over and groaning. Those who were told they were\nalready late were much less likely to help than those who were told\nthey had time to spare. These experiments are taken to show that minor\nfactors without moral significance (finding a dime, being in a hurry)\nare strongly correlated with people\u2019s helping behavior.\n\nPerhaps most damning for the robust view of character are the results\nof the experiments conducted by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s. In these\nexperiments the great majority of subjects, when politely though\nfirmly requested by an experimenter, were willing to administer what\nthey thought were increasingly severe electric shocks to a screaming\n\u201cvictim.\u201d These experiments are taken to show that if\nsubjects did have compassionate tendencies, these tendencies cannot\nhave been of the type that robust traits require.\n\nPhilosophers influenced by the experimental tradition in social\npsychology conclude that people do not have the broadly based, stable,\nconsistent traits of character that were of interest to the ancient\nand modern moralists, or to contemporary philosophers working with\nsome version of those views. Rather, the psychological studies are\ntaken to show that persons generally have only narrow,\n\u201clocal\u201d traits that are not unified with other traits into\na wider behavioral pattern. Persons are helpful when in a good mood,\nsay, but not helpful when in a hurry, or they are honest at home but\nnot honest at work. This skepticism about robust traits thus poses a\nchallenge to contemporary philosophers, especially those who work with\nsome version of the ancient views, to develop an account of character\nthat is consistent with empirical results.\n",
