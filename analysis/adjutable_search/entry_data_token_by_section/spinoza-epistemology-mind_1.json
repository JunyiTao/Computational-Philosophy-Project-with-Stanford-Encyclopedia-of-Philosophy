    "main_text": "Guiding commitments || Attribute barrier\n1.2 Attribute barrier\n\nA second guiding but unintuitive commitment of Spinoza\u2019s\nepistemology has come to be known as the \u201cattribute\nbarrier\u201d. A Spinozistic \u201cattribute\u201d is a descendant\nof the Cartesian \u201cprincipal attribute\u201d (AT 8a.25):\nroughly, it is the most basic qualitative kind under which something\ncan fall. For example, to say that something is a mental thing or a\nphysical thing \u2013 or, in Spinoza\u2019s and Descartes\u2019s\nterminology, \u201cthinking\u201d or \u201cextended\u201d \u2013\nis to understand it in terms of its particular\n\u201cattribute\u201d.\n\nMost commentators take Spinoza to uphold a total explanatory\nclosure of mental and physical realms: pace Descartes, no\nphysical thing can enter into conceptual or explanatory relations with\nanything mental, and vice versa. For example, regardless of how we\nmight experience things, no physical occurrence, such as shaking a\nfist at someone, can be made intelligible by appealing to anything\nmental, like a menacing intention. Analogously, no bodily injury can\nmake intelligible the feeling of pain.\n\nThis prohibition on any \u201cexplanatory flow\u201d (Bennett 1984)\nbetween mental and physical realms is the core meaning of\nSpinoza\u2019s attribute barrier doctrine. Given Spinoza\u2019s\ncommitment to universal intelligibility (see 1.1), derivatively, the\nimpossibility of conceptual relations between minds and bodies implies\nthe impossibility of causal relations between them (E3p2s).\nFor if something is in principle unintelligible (as any purported\ncausal relation between minds and bodies would be), it is also\nmetaphysically impossible. This prohibition on causal interactions\nbetween mental and physical things is the key secondary meaning of the\nbarrier doctrine.\n\nGiven that ordinarily we do appeal to intentions in\nexplaining our physical actions and to bodily states in explaining\nsensations, what would lead Spinoza to such a prima facie implausible\ndoctrine? The reason ultimately has to do with how Spinoza understands\nthe nature of the most fundamental entity in his metaphysics,\n\u201csubstance\u201d. Building on philosophical tradition that goes\nback to Aristotle, Spinoza associates being a \u201csubstance\u201d\nwith existential and explanatory self-sufficiency or independence\n(E1def3). Each essential quality or \u201cattribute\u201d of\nsubstance also must, Spinoza believes, manifest this independence\nproper to substance: \u201cEach attribute of a substance must be\nconceived through itself\u201d (E1p10). As a result, we cannot look\nfor an explanation of the fact that substance thinks, or of how it\nthinks, anywhere else but in substance\u2019s thinking nature (for\nexample, we cannot appeal to the fact that it is also a material\nthing, i.e., a substance with the attribute of\n\u201cextension\u201d). In this sense substance as thinking is\n\u201cconceived through itself\u201d. The same reasoning will be\ntrue of any other substantial attribute.\n\nThis gives us the basic application of the barrier doctrine: the fact\nthat God is a physical thing cannot explain God\u2019s nature as a\nthinking thing; nor is explanation possible in the other direction.\nBut the barrier doctrine also extends to creaturely\nintentions, sensations, and movements. Ontologically, all the things\nfamiliar to us from ordinary experience \u2013 animals, plants,\ninanimate objects \u2013 are for Spinoza merely modifications or\n\u201cmodes\u201d of the single substance, \u201cways\n[modis]\u201d that God is, just as (to borrow examples from\nLin 2018) a wrinkle in a rug is one way a rug can be, and a fist one\nway a hand can be. Spinoza explicitly applies the barrier doctrine\nalso to modes, stating that no modification of the thinking substance\ncan require for its explanation the concept extension, and no\nmodification of the extended substance can require for its explanation\nthe concept thought:\n\neach attribute is conceived through itself without any other (by\n1p10). So the modes of each attribute involve the concept of their own\nattribute, but not of another one. (E2p6d)\n\n\n(On attributes, see e.g. Gueroult 1958, Deleuze 1968, Shein 2009, Lin\n2019.)\n",
