    "main_text": "Thomas Aquinas || Secular and Spiritual Power\n9.1 Secular and Spiritual Power\n\nThe relationship between secular and spiritual power is discussed\nbriefly at the end of an early work, the Scripta super libros\nsententiarum (see\n 2, dist. 44, Expositio textus).\n When two authorities conflict, Thomas asks, how should we decide\nwhich to obey? He answers that if one authority originates totally\nfrom the other (as, he says, the authority of a bishop derives from\nthe pope), greater obedience in all matters is due to the originating\nauthority. If, however, both powers originate from a higher authority,\nthe higher authority will determine which of them takes precedence on\nwhich occasion. Spiritual and secular power, he says, both come from\nGod, so we should obey the spiritual over the secular only in matters\nwhich God has specified, namely matters concerning the salvation of\nthe soul, and in civic matters we should obey the secular power\u2014\n\n\n\nunless spiritual and secular power are joined in one person, as they\nare in the pope, who by God\u2019s arrangement holds the apex of both\nspiritual and secular powers. \n\n\nIn other words, the pope has supreme authority in both secular and\nspiritual matters.\n\nIn De regno Thomas constructs an Aristotelian teleological\nargument to the same conclusion. A polity has an end, purpose or goal,\nwhich may be sought in a variety of ways, effectively or not, and it\nis a composite entity consisting of many individuals with their own\nindividual purposes. For both reasons there is needed some directing\nagency to guide the potentially conflicting individuals effectively to\ntheir common goal. Every being is in some way one; a composite entity\nhas a unity of order, i.e., of direction to a single end. In\npreserving its being, therefore, the directing agency has to preserve\nthe polity in peace and unity by ordering it to a common goal. There\nis a hierarchy of goals, that is, there are intermediate ends which\nare also means to higher ends. A polity exists to secure its\ncitizens\u2019 lives, but above living there is living well, i.e.,\nvirtuously, and above that there is living so as to attain the\n\u201cbeatific vision\u201d of God (the Christian heaven). If all\nthese ordered ends were attainable simply by human effort, the one\nsupreme directing agency would be concerned with them all; however, to\nattain the beatific vision requires \u201cgrace\u201d, i.e.,\nGod\u2019s special help, which natural human activity cannot earn.\nBesides the state, humanity therefore needs the Church, a human agency\nGod has established to confer grace through the sacraments. Hence\nthere is a distinction between secular government, which uses\nnaturally available means to guide citizens to their final goal, and\necclesiastical government, which uses supernatural means, the\nsacraments. Secular rulers must be subject to the pope, \u201cfor\nthose to whom pertains the care of intermediate ends should be subject\nto him to whom pertains the care of the ultimate end\u201d.\n\nFor more detail see the section on Political Community in the entry on\n Aquinas\u2019s moral, political and legal philosophy.\n",
