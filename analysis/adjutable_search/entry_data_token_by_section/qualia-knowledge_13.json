    "main_text": "The Dualist View About the Knowledge Argument\n5. The Dualist View About the Knowledge Argument\n\nThere has not been much discussion of the knowledge argument from a\ndualist perspective. This is unsurprising given the small number of\ncontemporary philosophers who defend a dualist position (for a\nprominent exception see Chalmers (1996); the knowledge argument is\ndiscussed on pp. 140\u2013146). There are two possible strategies for\na dualist to take who wishes to defend the knowledge argument. The\nfirst is merely defensive or \u2018destructive\u2019 in that it\ntries to refute the positive theoretical proposals one by one that\nhave been used by physicalists in their objections against the\nknowledge argument. The second is more \u2018constructive\u2019 in\nthat it aims at developing an alternative positive dualist account of\nphenomenal concepts, phenomenal properties and their relations such\nthat on that account Mary does learn new and nonphysical facts upon\nrelease. Examples (or partial examples) for the first strategy may\noccasionally be found in the literature (compare Warner 1986, Gertler\n1999, Raymont 1995, 1999 and Connell 1994). Examples for the second\nare hard to find, but Chalmers (1996, 2002) and Nida-R\u00fcmelin\n(2007) exemplify the second strategy. Using his framework of primary\nand secondary intensions he develops a positive account of what he\ncalls \u201cpure phenomenal concepts\u201d that can be described as\nincorporating the old and natural intuition that in the case of qualia\n(phenomenal characters) there is no distinction between appearance and\nreality, in other words: qualia \u2018reveal their nature\u2019 in\nexperience.\n\nThe intuitive idea just mentioned has been expressed in different\nways. Some say that qualia \u2018have no hidden sides\u2019. Others\nsay that qualia are not natural kind terms in that it is not\nup to the sciences to tell us what having an experience of a\nparticular kind amounts to (we know what it amounts to by having them\nand attending to the quality at issue). It is quite clear that an\naccount of this intuitive idea has to be one of the ingredients of a\ndualist defense of the knowledge argument. Nida-R\u00fcmelin (2007)\ndevelops a technical notion of grasping properties which is intended\nto serve the purposes of dualists who argue against materialism using\nthe assumption that in the special case of phenomenal concepts the\nrelation that the thinker bears to the property he conceptualizes is\nmore intimate than in other cases: the thinker understands what having\nthe property essentially consists in. This idea can be used to block\nfamiliar objections to the knowledge argument in particular those\nfalling into the Old fact/ New Knowledge category. A similar basic\nidea but formulated within a different theoretical framework is\nelaborated in Stephen White (2007). \n\nAccording to mainstream opinion the most serious problem for property\ndualism is the danger of being driven into epiphenomenalism. If\nphenomenal characters are non-physical properties and if every\nphysical event has a physical cause and if we exclude the possibility\nof overdetermination (where something is caused by two different\ncauses that are both sufficient), then, arguably, whether or not a\nstate has a particular phenomenal character cannot have any causal\nrelevance. But if qualia are causally impotent, how can a person know\nthat she has an experience with a particular phenomenal character?\nMany take it to be obvious that a person cannot know that she now has\na blue experience unless her blue experience plays a prominent causal\nrole in the formation of her belief at issue. This particular problem\nhas been formulated as an objection against the knowledge argument in\nWatkins (1989). Until some time ago Jackson was one of the very few\nphilosophers who embraced epiphenomenalism. But Jackson changed his\nmind. Jackson (1995) argues that knowledge about qualia is impossible\nif qualia are epiphenomenal and he concludes that something must be\nwrong with the knowledge argument. In Jackson (2003) and Jackson\n(2007) he argues that the argument goes wrong in presupposing a false\nview about sensory experience and that it can be answered by endorsing\nstrong representationalism: the view that to be in a phenomenal state\nis to represent objective properties where the properties represented\nas well as the representing itself can be given a physicalist account.\nJackson admits that there is a specific phenomenal way of representing\nbut he now insists that the phenomenal way of representing can be\naccounted for in physicalist terms. Doubts about the latter claim are\ndeveloped in Alter (2007). Other possible reactions to the threat of\nepiphenomenalism for dualism would be either to doubt that a property\ndualist must embrace epiphenomenalism or to develop an account of\nknowledge about one\u2019s own phenomenal states that does not imply a\ncausal relation between qualia and phenomenal knowledge about qualia\n(see Chalmers 2002).\n",
