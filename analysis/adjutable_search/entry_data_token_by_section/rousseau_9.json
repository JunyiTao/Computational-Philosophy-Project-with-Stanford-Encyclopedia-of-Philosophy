    "main_text": "Language\n4. Language\n\nRousseau\u2019s writings on language and languages are contained in\ntwo places, the unpublished Essay on the Origin of Languages\nand in a section of the Discourse on the Origins of\nInequality. In the Essay, Rousseau tells us that human\nbeings want to communicate as soon as they recognize that there are\nother beings like themselves. But he also raises the question of why\nlanguage, specifically, rather than gesture is needed for this\npurpose. The answer, strangely enough, is that language permits the\ncommunication of the passions in a way that gesture does not, and that\nthe tone and stress of linguistic communication are crucial, rather\nthan its content. This point enables Rousseau to make a close\nconnection between the purposes of speech and melody. Such vocabulary\nas there originally was, according to Rousseau, was merely figurative\nand words only acquire a literal meaning much later. Theories that\nlocate the origin of language in the need to reason together about\nmatters of fact are, according to Rousseau, deeply mistaken. While the\ncry of the other awakens our natural compassion and causes us to\nimagine the inner life of others, our purely physical needs have an\nanti-social tendency because they scatter human beings more widely\nacross the earth in search of subsistence. Although language and song\nhave a common origin in the need to communicate emotion, over time the\ntwo become separated, a process that becomes accelerated as a result\nof the invention of writing. In the south, language stays closer to\nits natural origins and southern languages retain their melodic and\nemotional quality (a fact that suits them for song and opera).\nNorthern languages, by contrast, become oriented to more practical\ntasks and are better for practical and theoretical reasoning.\n\nIn Part I of the Second Discourse, Rousseau\u2019s focus is\nslightly different and occurs in the context of a polemic against\nphilosophers (such as natural law theorists like Condillac) who\nattribute to primitive human beings a developed capacity for abstract\nreasoning. Rousseau proposes need as the cause of the development of\nlanguage, but since language depends on convention to assign arbitrary\nsigns to objects, he puzzles about how it could ever get started and\nhow primitive people could accomplish the feat of giving names to\nuniversals.\n",
