    "main_text": "Metaphysics || The Soul\n3.4 The Soul\n\nIn response to Henry Dodwell\u2019s argument that the soul is\nnaturally mortal but is made immortal by God only at a baptism\nperformed by someone properly ordained, Clarke wrote an open letter\ndefending the soul\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d immortality on the\nbasis that the soul cannot be material, because what is material is\ndivisible, and what is divisible cannot be the source of the unity of\nconsciousness. (He assumes throughout that if the soul is immaterial\nthen it is immortal.) In response, the freethinker Anthony Collins\ndefended the position that consciousness can be an emergent property\nof matter, opening the door for a materialist theory of mind. Although\nhe opposed the natural mortality of the soul, Clarke thinks that God\ndestroys the souls of all the persons that are not admitted to heaven,\nso there is no hell of eternal suffering, perhaps justifying calling\nhim a \u201cmortalist\u201d (Wigelsworth 2009; 58ff). Clarke clearly\nendorsed the following: all souls survive bodily death; the soul\nremains in a state of (literal or metaphorical) sleep until the final\njudgment; the souls of sinners are destroyed at the final judgment.\n(See especially Obligations 179\u2013180 of 1706 edition; sermon preached\nOct 11 1709; Whiston 1730, 146; Sermon CXXI, 2.38\u201339; Snobelen 2004,\n275\u2013284).\n\nLoosely following Locke\u2019s distinctions, Clarke argues that there\nare three kinds of properties: those that inhere in the substance\n(real properties), those that are commonly but improperly believed to\nreside in the substance (secondary qualities), and \u201cmerely\nabstract names to express the effects\u201d of material\nsubstances or systems (CC 56\u201358). The third category includes\nmagnetism and gravity, which are properly descriptions of a different\nsubstance (in this case, divine activity and not matter). The second\ncategory are the traditional secondary qualities; the discussed\nexample is the smell of a rose. Consciousness falls in the first\ncategory, but, unlike the other members of that category such as\nmagnitude and figure, it does not divide or sum.\n\nEmploying what Kant (1781, A351) famously dubbed the \u201cAchilles\nargument,\u201d Clarke claims that the essential unity of\nconsciousness is incompatible with the divisibility and composability\nof matter, because the consciousness must be distributed among the\nvarious component parts, rendering each part conscious. Clarke is not\nclear on what exactly it is about consciousness that requires this\nunity (Rozemond 2003, 175\u2013177). Officially, consciousness is a\nreflexive act in which I recognize my thoughts as my own and is\ntherefore prior to memory, although Clarke sometimes writes\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d when he seems to mean \u201cmemory\u201d\n(Thiel 2011, 231).\n\nClarke\u2019s version of the Achilles argument rests on two\nprinciples. The Homogeneity Principle says that \u201ca power can\nreally inhere in a composite only if it is of the same kind as the\npowers of the parts\u201d (Vailati 1993, 395). Strictly, the\nHomogeneity Principle only applies to the first category of qualities\n(Rozemond 2009, 180). The Composition Principle says that \u201cthe\nproperties of the parts will sum to the same properties of the whole\n(and that the properties of the whole can be divided into the\nparts)\u201d (Uzgalis 2011, 23). William Uzgalis finds versions of\nthe Homogeneity Principle in Cudworth and Bayle, and in all three\ncases it is used to argue that thought or consciousness cannot arise\nfrom motion or figure because they are not of the same kind. A less\noften discussed variation on Clarke\u2019s core argument (but see\nRozemond 2003, 182ff) is that \u201cfigure, divisibility, mobility\nand other such like qualities of matter\u201d cannot produce\nconscious thought (a real power) because they are \u201cnot real,\nproper, distinct, and positive powers, but only negative qualities,\ndeficiencies, and imperfections,\u201d which appeals to the principle\nthat there can be no perfection or power in the effect that is not in\nthe cause (D 41, W 2.545).\n\nThe enduring soul serves as Clarke\u2019s explanation for personal\nidentity. Collins, following Locke, argued for a memory theory of\npersonal identity. Clarke\u2019s original attack on Collins claims\nthat God could put one person\u2019s memories into multiple people;\nthey would be distinct people but each would be identical to the\noriginal person, so identity is not transitive. Although\nClarke\u2019s argument became popular in the eighteenth century\n(Barresi and Martin 2004, 33\u201349), it seems to have been\nforgotten then reintroduced in the 1950s (Uzgalis 33, citing Flew\n1951, Prior 1957, and Williams 1957). Collins pointed out that\nClarke\u2019s theory faces an unpleasant dilemma, in that either animals\n(who do exhibit self-motion) do not think or have experiences\n(implausible) or God has to deal with an animal\u2019s soul (animal\nheaven? annihilation?) (Garrett 2013, 181).\n\nClarke\u2019s claim that the unity of consciousness is incompatible\nwith divisible matter is complicated by his apparent belief that souls\nare extended. At least, he refused to rule out the possibility that\nsouls are extended because \u201cas the parts of space or expansion\nitself can demonstrably be proved to be absolutely\nindiscerptible [indivisible], so it ought not to be reckoned an\ninsuperable difficulty to imagine that all immaterial thinking\nsubstances (upon supposition that expansion is not excluded out\nof their idea) may be so likewise\u201d (CC 62, W 3.763). The issue,\nas Clarke tries to frame it, is not that consciousness is incompatible\nwith extension but that it is incompatible with anything divisible\ninto parts. Because, following Newton, Clarke denies that space is\nactually divisible into parts, it cannot be ruled out that the soul is\nextended. His acceptance of the principle that there is no action at a\ndistance and of the claim that immaterial beings (both finite and God)\nact in space perhaps push him to accept that the soul is extended. If\nso, he does not provide details, for instance, whether the soul\noccupies the same space as the whole body, the brain, or some part of\nthe brain, or how souls move from place to place if not affected by\nbodies. Richard Price, defending Clarke, and Joseph Priestley both\nread Clarke as accepting extended souls. Priestley objects that souls\nmust therefore have shape (which he takes to be implausible) and must\ninterpenetrate God\u2019s spiritual substance (which he takes to be\nimpossible, as in the case of physical substances) (Price and\nPriestley 1777, 58\u201362).\n",
