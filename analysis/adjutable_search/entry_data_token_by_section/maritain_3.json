One also finds a number of important essays\non the topic in Raison et raisons, essais\nd\u00e9tach\u00e9s (1948, The Range of Reason).\nMaritain, again, largely follows the realist view of Thomas\nAquinas\u2014though he was significantly influenced by John of St\nThomas (John Poinsot), St John of the Cross, and St Augustine, and the\nstructure of Les degr\u00e9s du savoir is similar to the\nprocedure traced in the Itinerarium mentis in Deum [Journey of the Soul into God, 1259 [1938, 2002] of St Bonaventure.\n\nAgainst \u2018modern philosophy\u2019, Maritain insisted on the\npriority of metaphysics over epistemology\u2014in fact, he held that\n\u201cthe critique of knowledge is part of metaphysics\u201d\n(The Range of Reason, 1948 [1952: 25])\u2014and also\nmaintained that the structure and method of the various sciences were\ndetermined by the nature of the object to be known.\n\nMaritain called his view \u201ccritical realism\u201d, and argued\nparticularly against the then-dominant rationalist and empiricist\naccounts of knowledge. He maintained that, despite the differences\namong them, Kantianism, idealism, pragmatism, and positivism all\nreflected the influence of nominalism\u2014that universal notions are\ncreations of the human mind and have no foundation in reality.\nMaritain\u2019s critical realism holds that what the mind knows is\nidentical with what exists. To know a thing is for its\n\u2018essence\u2019 to exist immaterially in the mind. This is not\nto say that the mind mirrors or copies that which it knows, but that,\nin virtue of the properties apprehended, it \u2018becomes\u2019 the\nthings it knows. Maritain held that our knowledge of reality was\nthrough the \u2018concept\u2019\u2014the esse\nintentionale\u2014which was immaterial and universal, though the\nconcept itself was something known only by reflection. Thus, when it\ncomes to knowledge of sensible objects, for example, the mind has both\na passive role (receiving sense impressions) and an active one\n(constructing knowledge from these impressions) (see Deely 1997, Munoz\n2012).\n\nMaritain\u2019s epistemology sought to explain the nature of\nknowledge found not just in science and philosophy, but in religious\nfaith and mysticism, and one of his aims was to show the different\n\u2018kinds\u2019 of knowledge and their relations to one another.\nHe argued that there were different \u2018orders\u2019 of knowledge\nand, within them, different \u2018degrees\u2019 determined by the\nnature of the object to be known and the \u2018degree of\nabstraction\u2019 involved.\n\nFirst, in the order of rational knowledge, one can speak of the\nknowledge of sensible nature (i.e., of the objects of experimental\nscience), which is different from the knowledge of mathematics or of\n\u2018physico-mathematical\u2019 objects (which is limited because\nits objects do not have a direct relation to the actual), which is, in\nturn, distinct from the knowledge of trans-sensible or metaphysical\nnature.\n\nThese \u2018degrees of knowledge\u2019 are not, however, independent\nof one another, and they have in common the requirement that to know\nsomething is to know why it is \n\n\nthe mind is not satisfied when it merely attains a thing [\u2026],\nbut only when it grasps that upon which that datum is founded in being\nand intelligibility. (Degrees of Knowledge, 1932 [1959: 23])\n\n\n\nFor example, natural science, which is based on sense perception, aims\nat formulating laws which reflect certain features of the objects\nperceived. The scientist, then, is primarily concerned with looking\nfor regularities in nature, employing what Maritain calls an\n\u201cempiriological\u201d approach (see Degrees of\nKnowledge, 1932 [1959: 178\u2013180]; Philosophy of\nNature, 1935 [1951: 49]). (An empiriological analysis is a\nnon-philosophical and, specifically, non-ontological approach to\nunderstanding natural beings that does not seek to know them \u201cin\nterms of their type of being or reality\u201d, but only \u201cin\nterms of their empirical manifestations\u201d (Carlson 2012: 37).\nSuch an analysis does not provide knowledge of the essence of natural\nbeings. Maritain offers mathematical physics as an illustration of\nthis approach.) The product of this method is what Maritain calls\n\u201cperinoetical\u201d knowledge.\n\nBut for natural science to achieve the status of a science, it\npresupposes the capacity of human beings to know things apart from\ntheir particular individuating characteristics (though not apart from\nthe existence of matter), i.e., natural philosophy. Natural philosophy\n\u2018gets behind\u2019 phenomena in order to discover essential\nconnections and causes. Thus, from that which is presented in sense\nperception, the mind constructs an object (the essence) which is\nuniversal. (This is possible because, Maritain maintains, there are\nessences or natures of things.) This process of \u2018thinking\nthrough\u2019 to the nature of the thing is called by Maritain\ndianoetical knowledge. So, while natural science and natural\nphilosophy both focus on the physical, the natural\nphilosopher\u2014unlike the scientist\u2014is concerned with the\nessence of the object and its definition (or, at the very least, an\naccount of its various properties). This is knowledge at the level of\nthe first \u2018degree of abstraction\u2019.\n\nPhysico-mathematical objects (e.g., quantity, number, and extension)\nstand at a second \u2018degree\u2019 of abstraction. While they\ncannot exist without the existence of material things, once known,\nthey can be conceived of without any reference to such objects.\nFinally, metaphysical or speculative knowledge deals with objects\nexisting at a third degree of abstraction (i.e., independently of\nmatter), such as substance, quality, goodness, and the divine. Because\nof the nature of the objects of metaphysics, this latter kind of\nknowledge does not involve logical inference as much as reasoning by\nanalogy or what Maritain calls ananoetic knowledge. Such\nknowledge (e.g., of the divine) is not through any direct\napprehension, but indirectly, through creatures.\n\nThere is a hierarchy among these \u2018degrees of knowledge\u2019.\nThose objects which are highest in intelligibility, immateriality, and\npotential to be known are the objects of the highest degree of\nknowledge. Maritain writes, \n\n\n[t]he metaphysician considers an object of knowing of a specifically\nhigher nature and intelligibility, and from it he acquires a proper\nknowledge, a scientific knowledge, by means that absolutely transcend\nthose of the physicist or the mathematician. (Degrees of\nKnowledge, 1932 [1959: 37]) \n\n\nNevertheless, while there are different \u2018orders\u2019 and\n\u2018degrees\u2019 of knowledge, one should not conclude that there\nare different \u2018knowledges\u2019.\n\nMaritain points out that philosophical demonstration is different from\nnatural scientific or mathematical demonstrations: \n\n\nphilosophy is concerned with an objectively distinct field of\nknowledge and constitutes a really autonomous discipline, possessing\nits own adequate means of explaining this field of knowledge.\n(Range of Reason, 1948 [1952: 5]) \n\n\nThus, Maritain writes, natural philosophy penetrates to the nature of\nits object. Metaphysics\u2014which is also a kind of philosophic\nknowing\u2014is concerned with purely intelligible being. Science,\nhowever, is at best \u2018empiriological\u2019\u2014it does not\nlead us to being itself, but only to the observable and measurable.\nConsequently, to employ a method of scientific demonstration to\nestablish or to criticize claims about the object of metaphysical\nknowledge is, to use Ryle\u2019s classic term, a category mistake. It\nis precisely because he holds that empiricist and rationalist\nepistemologies do this, that Maritain takes issue with them.\n\nJust as there is an order of rational knowledge with its\n\u2018degrees\u2019, there is another order and degrees of\nsuprarational knowledge\u2014of a higher wisdom\u2014that is beyond\n\u2018natural knowledge\u2019. These are, on the one hand,\n\u2018the science of revealed mysteries\u2019 or \u2018theological\nwisdom\u2019 and, on the other, \u2018mystical theology\u2019.\nHere, Maritain\u2019s debt to Augustine and John of the Cross is\nparticularly evident (see Barreiro 2008). According to Maritain, in\ntheological wisdom, the divine is known by drawing not just on reason\nbut on faith. (This is distinct from metaphysical knowledge which, so\nto speak, approaches the divine from the \u2018outside\u2019.)\nMystical knowledge stands one level higher still\u2014where there is\nno mediation by concepts\u2014and \u201cconsists in knowing\n[\u2026] Deity as such\u2014according to a mode that is\nsuprahuman and supernatural\u201d (The Degrees of\nKnowledge, 1932 [1959: 253]). This is a knowledge by\nconnaturality, but also a knowledge that can be pursued through the\npractical discipline of \u2018mystical contemplation\u2019. In this\nway, human beings acquire a kind of knowledge that makes them more\nloving and more spiritual. (It is worth noting that, for Maritain,\nthis mysticism extended beyond the Christian tradition. Not only did\nhe refer to the example of Ramanuja, but he encouraged the future\nIndologist Olivier Lacombe to direct his \u201cphilosophical work\ntowards the study of Indian mysticism\u201d [Lardinois 2017: 314].)\n\n\nThe development of the notion of \u2018knowledge by\nconnaturality\u2019 (or \u2018connatural knowledge\u2019 or\n\u2018knowledge by inclination\u2019), latent in Aquinas (Summa\ntheologiae, II-II, q. 45, a 2), is one of Maritain\u2019s major\ncontributions to epistemology. Maritain places this knowledge at the\nlevel of the preconscious intellect. It is \u201cnon-conceptual and\nnon-rational\u201d, (Natural Law, 2001: 18); he describes it\nas \n\n\nobscure, unsystematic, vital knowledge, by means of instinct or\nsympathy, and in which the intellect, in order to make its judgments,\nconsults the inner leanings of the subject. (Man and the\nState, 1951: 91) \n\n\nNor is it, as much knowledge is, a knowledge of essences.\nNevertheless, it is still connected to \u201cintellectual act\u201d\nand is a genuine knowledge of reality. This kind of knowledge lies at\nthe basis, not only of mystical experience, but of artistic activity\nand morality; it provides a knowledge of God, of the first principles\nof morality, and a knowledge of one\u2019s own subjectivity. \n\nA number of questions have been raised concerning Maritain\u2019s\nepistemology, particularly concerning his characterization of\nphilosophical knowledge. Moreover, while Maritain claims that there is\na difference in method between the sciences and philosophy, some have\nargued that it is not clear what exactly that difference is (Vitoria\n2011). For example, Maritain would follow Aquinas in holding that\nmetaphysics uses demonstratio quia\u2014demonstration from\neffects. But it would seem that science also sometimes uses such a\nmethod of demonstration. Thus, it is not clear what it is in the\nmethod (as distinct from the content of the premises) that\ndifferentiates a metaphysical proof (e.g., of God\u2019s existence)\nfrom a scientific argument establishing the existence of a cause of a\nnatural object.\n\nSecond, Maritain holds that scientific knowledge is distinguished from\nphilosophical knowledge in terms of their different methods and\ndifferent objects. But if scientific knowledge and philosophical\nknowledge are, as it were, incommensurable, it is not clear how\nphilosophy can judge, or be corrective of, the sciences.\n\nSome Thomist scholars have been reluctant to adopt Maritain\u2019s\ndevelopment of Aquinas\u2019 notion of \u2018knowledge by\nconnaturality\u2019, preferring instead to speak of \u201cknowledge\nrelative to inclination\u201d (Dewan 2010). Yet others have argued\nthat this development is of far-reaching significance, as\nMaritain\u2019s notion of the intuition of being led him, in the\nyears following the publication of The Degrees of Knowledge,\nto recognise a greater role to be played by \u201cthe unconscious and\npreconscious life of the mind\u201d (The Range of Reason,\n1948 [1952: 80]; Arraj 2006). \n\nFinally, it would seem that the model of demonstration that Maritain\nemploys is foundationalist and, thus, has to answer to those\ncriticisms that modern anti-foundationalism draws attention\nto\u2014e.g., that a foundationalist theory sets a standard for\nknowledge that is not only without justification, but is a standard\nthat it cannot itself satisfy. Some defences of Thomistic epistemology\n(e.g., Veatch 1990),\nhowever, suggest ways in which such a concern might be addressed.\n",
