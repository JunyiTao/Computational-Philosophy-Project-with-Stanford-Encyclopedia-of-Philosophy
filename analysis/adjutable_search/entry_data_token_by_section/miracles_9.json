    "main_text": "Arguments against Miracle Claims || Particular arguments\n3.2 Particular arguments\n\n\nBecause the field of arguments for miracles is so wide, a\nconsideration of all of the criticisms that have been leveled against\nparticular arguments for miracles would fill many volumes. But four\nparticular arguments raised by Hume are sufficiently well known to be\nof interest to philosophers.\n\n\nIn Part 2 of his essay \u201cOf Miracles,\u201d Hume argues that\nthere never was a miraculous event established on evidence so full as\nto amount to an \u201centire proof.\u201d The considerations Hume\nmarshals in this section had, for the most part, been canvassed\nthoroughly during the deist controversy in the preceeding half century;\nHume\u2019s credit in this Part is not that of originating the\narguments but rather that of stating them clearly and forcefully.\n3.2.1 The argument from inauspicious conditions\n\n\nFirst, Hume lists a set of conditions that would, in his view, be\nnecessary in order for an argument from testimony to have its full\nforce, and he argues that no miracle report has ever met these\nconditions:\n\n\n[T]here is not to be found, in all history, any miracle attested by\na sufficient number of men, of such unquestioned good sense, education,\nand learning, as to secure us against all delusion in themselves; of\nsuch undoubted integrity, as to place them beyond all suspicion of any\ndesign to deceive others; of such credit and reputation in the eyes of\nmankind, as to have a great deal to lose in case of their being\ndetected in any falsehood; and at the same time attesting facts,\nperformed in such a public manner, and in so celebrated a part of the\nworld, as to render the detection unavoidable: All which circumstances\nare requisite to give us a full assurance in the testimony of men.\n(Hume 1748/2000: 88)\n\n\nHume does not elaborate on these conditions, and it is difficult to\nsay how he might have responded to Leland\u2019s charge that they are\nnot necessary and would in some cases cut the other direction. For\nexample, Leland argues that meeting the condition of \u201ccredit and\nreputation\u201d would actually have weakened the evidence for the\nChristian miracles:\n\n\nIt might have been said with some shew of plausibility, that such\npersons by their knowledge and abilities, their reputation and\ninterest, might have it in their power to countenance and propagate an\nimposture among the people, and give it some credit in the world.\n(Leland 1755: 90\u201391; cf. Beckett 1883: 29\u201337)\n3.2.2 The argument from the passions of surprise and wonder\n\n\nThomas Morgan (1739: 31) raises a second charge in these words:\n\n\nMen are the more easily imposed on in such Matters, as they love to\ngratify the Passion of Admiration, and take a great deal of\nPleasure in hearing or telling of Wonders.\n\n\nThe implication is twofold: miracle stories are more likely than\nother falsehoods to be told, since they cater to a natural\nhuman desire to be amazed; and they are more likely than other\nfalsehoods to be believed, since the same passions conduce to\ntheir uncritical reception. Hume, perhaps following Morgan, makes much\nthe same point in nearly the same words. But he goes beyond Morgan in\nspecifying a further exacerbating factor: the religious context of a\nmiracle claim, he urges, makes the telling of a miracle story even more\nlikely.\n\n\n[I]f the spirit of religion join itself to the love of wonder, there\nis an end of common sense; and human testimony, in these circumstances,\nloses all pretensions to authority. A religionist may be an enthusiast,\nand imagine he sees what has no reality: He may know his narrative to\nbe false, and yet persevere in it, with the best intentions in the\nworld, for the sake of promoting so holy a cause: Or even where this\ndelusion has not place, vanity, excited by so strong a temptation,\noperates on him more powerfully than on the rest of mankind in any\nother circumstances; and self-interest with equal force. (Hume\n1748/2000: 89)\n\n\n\n\nBut as George Campbell points out (1762/1839: 48\u201349), this\nconsideration cuts both ways; the religious nature of the claim may\nalso operate to make it less readily received:\n\n\n[T]he prejudice resulting from the religious affection, may just as\nreadily obstruct as promote our faith in a religious\nmiracle. What things in nature are more contrary, than one religion is\nto another religion? They are just as contrary as light and darkness,\ntruth and error. The affections with which they are contemplated by the\nsame person, are just as opposite as desire and aversion, love and\nhatred. The same religious zeal which gives the mind of a Christian a\npropensity to the belief of a miracle in support of\nChristianity, will inspire him with an aversion from the\nbelief of a miracle in support of Mahometanism. The same principle\nwhich will make him acquiesce in evidence less than sufficient\nin one case, will make him require evidence more than\nsufficient in the other\u2026.\n\n\n\u2026 [T]hat the evidence arising from miracles performed in proof\nof a doctrine disbelieved, and consequently hated before, did in fact\nsurmount that obstacle, and conquer all the opposition arising thence,\nis a very strong presumption in favour of that evidence; just as strong\na presumption in its favour, as it would have been against it, had all\ntheir former zeal, and principles, and prejudices, co-operated with the\nevidence, whatever it was, in gaining an entire assent.\n\n\n\nMoreover, as Campbell (1762/1839: 49) immediately points out,\n\n\nthere is the greatest disparity in this respect, a disparity which\ndeserves to be particularly attended to, betwixt the evidence of\nmiracles performed in proof of a religion to be established,\nand in contradiction to opinions generally received; and the\nevidence of miracles performed in support of a religion\nalready established, and in confirmation of opinions\ngenerally received.\n\n\nIt is, therefore, a debatable question whether the consideration of\nthe passions evoked by tales of the miraculous works for or against the\nmiracle claim in any given instance. This is not an issue that can be\nsettled in advance of a detailed consideration of the facts.\n3.2.3 The argument from ignorance and barbarism\n\n\nA third general argument is that miracle stories are most popular in\nbackward cultures. As John Toland (1702: 148) puts it,\n\n\nit is very observable, that the more ignorant and barbarous any\nPeople remain, you shall find \u2019em most abound with Tales of this\nnature \u2026\n\n\nThe unstated moral to be drawn is that both the production and the\nreception of miracle stories are due to a failure to understand the\nsecondary causes lying behind phenomena, while increasing knowledge and\nculture leaves no room for such stories. Hume (2000: 90\u201391) also\nborrowed this line of reasoning.\n\n\nBut the supposed trajectory of societies from ignorant superstition\nto enlightened rationalism owes a good deal more to selective\nillustration than one would suspect from reading Toland and Hume.\nCampbell (1762/1839: 70) points out that in the Qur\u2019an\nMohammed made no claim to work public miracles, though by\nToland\u2019s (and Hume\u2019s) reasoning the circumstances would\nhave been most propitious for such tales. Coming forward in time,\nmiracle stories abounded in the 18th century, as Hume well knew. And\nrenowned scientists such as Isaac Newton and Robert Boyle were well\nknown defenders of the Christian miracle claims. Other forces are at\nwork in the creation and acceptance of miracle stories besides the\nrelative level of civilization and education.\n3.2.4 The argument from parity\n\n\nAs a fourth and final argument, Hume sketches some accounts of\npurported miracles outside of the canonical Christian\nscriptures\u2014two cures ascribed to Vespasian, one Catholic miracle\nreported to have been worked at Saragossa, and some cures ascribed to\nthe influence of the tomb of the Jansenist Abbe Paris in the early\n1700s\u2014and suggests that their affidavits are in various respects\nas good as one could wish for. Hume clearly expects his Protestant\nreaders to reject these stories with disdain. He leaves unstated the\nobvious conclusion: by parity, his readers should also reject the\nmiracles of the New Testament.\n\n\nSetting Protestants and Catholics by the ears over the miracles of\nlater ecclesiastical history was an old game by Hume\u2019s time, and\na small industry had grown up on the Protestant side providing criteria\nfor sifting the genuine apostolic miracles from their Catholic\ncounterfeits (Leslie 1697/1815, Douglas 1757, Warfield 1918). Hume\u2019s\ncontemporary critics rose to the challenge and argued vigorously that\nhis descriptions of the alleged \u201cmiracles,\u201d Pagan,\nCatholic, and Jansenist, distorted the historical sources and were\nhopelessly one sided (Leland 1755: 102 ff, Adams 1767: 74 ff, Campbell\n1762/1839: 96 ff, Douglas 1757: 96 ff).\n\n\nAside from these specific criticisms, one important general line of\nargument emerges in the criticisms, articulated well by Adams (1767:\n73):\n\n\nThere is a wide difference betwixt establishing false miracles, by\nthe help of a false religion, and establishing a false religion by the\nhelp of false miracles. Nothing is more easy than the former of these,\nor more difficult than the latter.\n\n\nAll attempts to draw an evidential parallel between the miracles of\nthe New Testament and the miracle stories of later ecclesiastical\nhistory are therefore dubious. There are simply more resources for\nexplaining how the ecclesiastical stories, which were promoted to an\nestablished and favorably disposed audience, could have arisen and been\nbelieved without there being any truth to the reports.\n",
