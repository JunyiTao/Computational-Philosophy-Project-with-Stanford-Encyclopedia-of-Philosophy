Albert the Great, Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas\n\nFollowing Avicenna\u2019s faculty psychology and the new division\nbetween concupiscible and irascible emotions, Albert the Great and\nThomas Aquinas treated emotions as acts of the sensory moving powers.\nWhile Albert employed the Stoic-based classifications of Nemesius of\nEmesa and John Damascene in his works (De homine q.\n66\u201367; De bono 3.5.2\u20133), Thomas Aquinas put\nforward a new taxonomy (Summa theologiae II-1, 22\u201348)\nwhich was probably influenced by John of la Rochelle. Albert argued\nthat emotions should be regarded as qualities as Aristotle described\nthem in Categories 8 (De bono 3.5.1, 3.5.3). Aquinas\ndefended the characterization of them as movements of the soul,\nfinding the basic classificatory principles of emotions in\nAristotle\u2019s doctrine of contrary movements in Physics\nV.5. Bonaventure differed from these authors in relativizing the\ndifference between sensory and intellectual moving powers and\nattributing emotions to the intellectual soul in a proper sense and\nnot merely metaphorically as was traditionally done. In addressing the\nsoul of Christ in the third book of his Commentary on the\nSentences, Bonaventure argues that there were concupiscible and\nirascible parts in Christ\u2019s intellectual will as well as\npassions of joy and distress. Similar ideas were also put forward\nearlier in the so-called Summa Halensis (Bonaventure,\nSent. III.16.2.1 (354); III.33.1.3 (717); see also Prentice\n1957; Vaura 2017). Even though Bonaventure\u2019s account remained\nsketchy, it influenced the Franciscan view of the emotions of the will\nthat came to be more systematically analyzed by John Duns Scotus.\n\nIn discussing emotions in Summa theologiae II-1.22\u201348,\nAquinas first divided them in terms of their generic objects: the\nconcupiscible emotions react to what seems good or evil at the sensory\nlevel, whereas the irascible emotions react to arduous sense-good and\nsense-evil. The sensory moving faculties are activated by objects\nthrough cognition, and the modes of the resulting emotional movements\nserve as further qualifications in defining particular emotions. In\nemploying the Avicennian conception of the estimative power that\ngrasps the emotionally relevant aspects of objects, Aquinas says that\nthis could be called particular reason in humans (Summa\ntheologiae I.78.4) The recognizable evaluative property (such as\nbeing dangerous) could be called the formal object of emotion\n(Summa theologiae II-1.43.1; cf. Kenny 1963: 189; King\n2011).\n\nIn his attempt to classify emotions with the help of Aristotle\u2019s\nphysical theory of movements, Aquinas distinguishes between two types\nof the contraries of movements: the approach to something and retreat\nfrom it, and movements associated with contrary endpoints. The\ncontrary movements of the concupiscible power are of the second type,\ntowards contrary ends (sense-good and sense-evil). The contrary\nmovements of the irascible power are of the first type, with respect\nto the same objects.\n\nAquinas classifies (1) love, (2) desire and (3) pleasure or joy as the\nthree self-regarding concupiscible emotions with respect to the\nsense-good; the contrary movements with respect to sense-evil are (4)\nhate, (5) aversion and (6) pain or distress. As for the irascible\nemotions, the arduous future sense-good may give rise to (7) hope or\n(8) despair, the arduous future sense-evil to (9) fear or (10)\ncourage, and the arduous present sense-evil to (11) anger\u2014this\nis without a contrary pair (Summa theologiae II-1.\n24.2\u20134, 25.2; see also King 1999.) \n\nAquinas\u2019s attempt to combine the Avicennian view of emotions as\nthe act of the sensory moving power with Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of\nmovement involves some theoretical problems. In distinguishing between\nlove, desire and pleasure as the incipient movement, actual movement,\nand rest, Aquinas treats emotions as the behavioral changes that the\nmoving power is supposed to cause rather than the moving acts\nthemselves (Summa theologiae II-1. 25.2; for moving acts, see\n30.2; 23.4.) This is confusing, but he apparently assumes that the\nvarious acts of the moving power could be distinguished as causing\nvarious behavioral movements if these are not prevented. Aquinas also\ndistinguishes between the formal constituent of emotion, which is the\ngeneric content of emotional evaluation, and the material constituent,\nwhich is the particular intentional object, and further between the\nmovements of the moving power that constitute the form of emotions\nwith respect to their material constituents such as the movements of\nthe heart, the spirits and the humors (Summa theologiae II-1.\n28.5, 30.2, 43.1, 44.1). The behavioral movements to which\nAristotle\u2019s physics is applied are not mentioned in these\ncontexts. Emotions are essentially psychosomatic in Aquinas, and thus\nnot possible for bodiless beings such as God and angels (Summa\ntheologiae II-1.22.3). \n\nAs for pleasure and distress, Aquinas explains that while one might\nspeak about a stone as loving its natural place and desiring to be\nthere, it does not make sense to speak about the pleasure or pain of a\nstone because it does not feel. He holds that pleasure or distress is\na pleasant or unpleasant awareness and this is an aspect of emotions\nin general since some kind of pleasure is involved in positive\nemotions and some kind of pain in negative ones (Summa\ntheologiae II-1.43.1). Giles of Rome, who mostly followed\nAquinas\u2019s taxonomy, remarked that pleasure and distress as\nemotions are states of having moved rather than movements. He also\nwanted to add meekness, an opposite to anger in Aquinas\u2019s\ntaxonomy (see Marmo 1991). \n\nAquinas\u2019s discussion of emotions, the most extensive in medieval\nliterature, involves detailed terminological, psychological and\nethical remarks on each emotion type. Like all medieval authors,\nAquinas argues that the intellectual soul should keep emotions under\nstrict control, but he also criticized the Stoic apatheia and\nPlotinus\u2019s version of freedom from emotions (Summa\ntheologiae II-1.24.3, 59.2, 61.5). As in Aristotle, the virtues\nof the sensory soul are habits to feel emotions in accordance with the\njudgments of practical reason. Emotions themselves do not provide a\nsufficient guidance for a good life. Aquinas\u2019s theory and\ntaxonomy were very influential until the seventeenth century.
