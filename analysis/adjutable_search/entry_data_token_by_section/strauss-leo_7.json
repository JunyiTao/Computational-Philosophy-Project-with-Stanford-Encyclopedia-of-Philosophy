Philosophy and Revelation Revisited\n\nThat the right way of life remains questionable and hence the claim\nfor philosophy\u2019s modesty regarding its own capabilities brings\nus back to philosophy\u2019s relation to revelation. Without a\ncompleted metaphysics, philosophy cannot refute revelation. This\ninability to refute revelation has serious consequences for\nphilosophy\u2019s self-understanding. As Strauss puts it in\nNatural Right and History, in what is probably his most well\nknown statement on the topic:\n\nPhilosophy has to grant that revelation is possible. But to grant that\nrevelation is possible means to grant that the philosophic life is not\nnecessarily, not evidently, the right life. Philosophy, the\nlife devoted to the quest for evident knowledge available to man as\nman, would rest on an unevident, arbitrary, or blind decision. This\nwould merely confirm the thesis of faith, that there is no possibility\nof consistency, of a consistent and thoroughly sincere life, without\nbelief in revelation. The mere fact that philosophy and revelation\ncannot refute each other would constitute the refutation of philosophy\nby revelation. (NRH, p. 75)\n\n\nHere we see that, for Strauss, the tension between revelation and\nphilosophy is not one between irrationality and rationality but\nbetween fundamentally irreconcilable criteria for what constitutes the\nrational starting point of truth. Philosophy begins and ends\nfor Strauss with the philosopher\u2019s sense of wonder, while\nrevealed religion begins and ends with adherence to the divine law.\nYet as Strauss suggests, this situation puts philosophy at a\ndisadvantage and revelation at an advantage. Never claiming to rest on\nevident knowledge, revelation can rationally approach its truth\nclaims, not to prove them but to understand them. But philosophy,\nwhich values reason first and foremost, is led to the unpleasant truth\nthat it is in fact predicated on something that is and remains\nunevident: that the human question for knowledge is the right\nlife.\n\nStrauss\u2019s simultaneous criticism of the self-sufficiency of\nreason and defense of the rational plausibility (though not the\ncertainty) of revelation bears an important affinity to arguments of\ncontemporary Christian philosophers of religion, such as Alvin\nPlantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff, who point out that philosophers\nand others take many things for granted for which we do not have\ncertain evidence, such as sense perception, memory, or the inner lives\nof other people. Like Strauss, these philosophers of religion\ncriticize the hubris of Enlightenment attempts to define knowledge\nonly in terms of scientific evidence. Once we dispense with modern\nphilosophy\u2019s overreaching claims for reason, the fact that\nrevelation cannot be proven definitively does not rule out the\npossibility of making rational arguments about God\u2019s revelation.\nSuch arguments become impossible only when absolute proof for\nGod\u2019s existence is the prerequisite for reasoning about\nrevelation.\n\nHowever, unlike Plantinga and Wolterstorff, Strauss\u2019s project is\nnot to make rational arguments for God\u2019s revelation but only to\nsuggest that such arguments are in theory possible. Because Strauss\nclearly is not interested in offering a constructive theology, some\ninterpreters have concluded that, despite appearances to the contrary,\nhe did not really take the possibility of revelation seriously.\nPerhaps most notably, the eminent Strauss scholar, Heinrich Meier,\nmaintains that Strauss purposely overstates the problem posed by\nrevelation for philosophy in order to inspire philosophical readers in\ntheir quest for the philosophical life. Meier further understands the\ntheologico-political problem in terms of what he claims is\nStrauss\u2019s life-long effort to create a philosophical school.\nMeier\u2019s basic contention is that the quarrel between revelation\nand philosophy as Strauss describes it leaves the careful reader many\nopportunities to consider whether revelation really does constitute\nthe refutation of philosophy and to realize that philosophy does in\nfact have philosophical and moral resources from which to respond to\nrevelation.\n\nIt is true that some of Strauss\u2019s sketches of revelation do not\nmake revelation compelling from a philosophical point of view. If the\nquestion about the relation between revelation and philosophy pertains\nto a decision for faith or philosophy, Strauss\u2019s conception of\nrevelation sounds very much like Kierkegaard\u2019s conception\naccording to which a leap of faith defines revelation. This\ntheological vantage point is similar to Strauss\u2019s description of\nFranz Rosenzweig and Karl Barth\u2019s reawakening of theology. Yet\nStrauss explicitly rejects this sort of theological decisionism\nbecause, he argues, this position amounts to a \u201cfarewell to\nreason.\u201d By mistakenly assuming that Strauss defines revelation\nas blind faith, many of Strauss\u2019s interpreters have concluded\nthat he does not in the end take revelation seriously from a\nphilosophical point of view. In support of this position, Meier in\nfact quotes Julius Guttmann\u2019s critical response to Strauss,\nwhich is that Strauss shows an \u201cindifference towards the content\nof revelation\u2026 Whether Jewish or Christian revelation is of\nconcern makes no difference whatsoever\u201d (as quoted in Meier\n2006, p. 20). For Guttmann, this supposed indifference to\nrevelation\u2019s content means that Strauss gets medieval Jewish\nrationalism wrong. For Meier, this supposed indifference means that\ndespite what seems to be Strauss\u2019s defense of revelation\u2019s\ncapacity to criticize philosophy, revelation is in the end for Strauss\na straw man. As Meier puts it, \u201cWhat appears to the believer to\nbe \u2018indifference\u2019 proves on closer inspection to be a\nconscious dissociation and ultimately a rejection\u201d (Meier 2006,\np. 20, note 25). \n\nYet Strauss was not indifferent to the content of revelation and\ncertainly not to the difference between Jewish and Christian notions\nof revelation. In fact, Strauss strongly criticizes what he regards as\na particularly Christian view of revelation not in order to banish\nrevelation from intellectual conversation once and for all but to\nsuggest that modernity\u2019s intellectual ills stem in large part\nfrom the legacy of Christian theology. In a 1952 letter to Gershom\nScholem, Strauss rejects his early reading of Maimonides in\nPhilosophy and Law as the \u201cJewish equivalence of Thomas\nAquinas.\u201d  Describing the development of his views on Maimonides,\nStrauss writes to Scholem that he has \u201cmoved, so to speak, contrary to\nG.\u2019s [Guttmann\u2019s] moderate rationalism\u2026to\n\u2018radical\u2019 rationalism\u201d (GS 3, 728).  Strikingly, it was on\nthe basis of the Islamic, as opposed to the Christian, reception of\nclassical political philosophy that Strauss turned to the possiblity\nof \u201cradical rationalism\u201d by reconsidering the meanings of philosophy,\nrevelation, and politics.  Strauss\u2019s very attempt to move beyond\nmodern philosophy is predicated on a distinction between the Jewish\nand Islamic conception of revelation on the one hand, and the\nChristian conception, on the other hand:\n\nFor the Christian, the sacred doctrine is revealed theology; for the\nJew and the Muslim, the sacred doctrine is, at least primarily the\nlegal interpretation of the Divine Law (talmud or\nfiqh). The sacred doctrine in the latter sense has, to say\nthe least, much less in common with philosophy than the sacred\ndoctrine in the former sense. It is ultimately for this reason that\nthe status of philosophy was, as a matter of principle, much more\nprecarious in Judaism and in Islam than in Christianity: in\nChristianity philosophy became an integral part of the officially\nrecognized and even required training of the student of the sacred\ndoctrine\u2026.The precarious position of philosophy in the\nIslamic-Jewish world guaranteed its private character and therewith\nits inner-freedom from supervision. The status of philosophy in the\nIslamic-Jewish world resembled in this respect its status in classical\nGreece. (PAW, pp. 18\u201319, 21)\n\n\nStrauss problematizes the Christian view of revelation as doctrinal\nknowledge that must be believed. From his early to his mature\nwritings, Strauss contends that the making of revelation into\nknowledge in scholastic theology ultimately led to modern\nphilosophy\u2019s far too over-reaching claims. As Strauss puts it\nrather succinctly, \u201cOn the querelle des anciens et des\nmodernes: I do not deny, but assert, that modern philosophy has\nmuch that is essential in common with Christian medieval philosophy;\nbut that means that the attack of the moderns is directed\ndecisively against ancient philosophy\u201d (CCM, p. 106).\nOr, as he puts it elsewhere, \u201cmodern philosophy emerged by way\nof transformation of, if in opposition to, Latin or Christian\nscholasticism\u201d (JPCM, p. 252).\n\nStrauss\u2019s distinction between Judaism and Islam, on the one\nhand, and Christianity, on the other, is decisive for understanding\nhis conception of the relation between Jerusalem and Athens as well as\nfor appreciating his conception of the theologico-political problem,\nas a diagnosis of modernity\u2019s philosophical, theological, and\npolitical ills. On an epistemological level, philosophy may well have\ngood arguments to make in response to revelation. Strauss explicitly\ncriticizes what he regards as Rosenzweig\u2019s and Karl\nBarth\u2019s decisionist conception of revelation, i.e. revelation as\na leap of faith, which, he maintains, holds no promise of rationalism.\nFrom an epistemological point of view, philosophy understood as a way\nof life, concerned with problems and unconvinced of promises of\nabsolute solutions, will appear more rational to potential\nphilosophers.\n\nYet for Strauss the serious argument with which revelation challenges\nphilosophy is not epistemological but moral. This is not to deny the\nimportance of the pursuit of truth for Strauss, but it is to return to\nhis criticism of the modern depreciation of pre-scientific or\npre-philosophical knowledge. Again, Strauss is a critic of the\nEnlightenment\u2019s view of the self-sufficiency of reason. If\nphilosophy is to have critical potential, argues Strauss, philosophy\nmust be skeptical even of itself. This means that philosophers should\nnot only tolerate religion for their own instrumental purposes but\nthat philosophy is challenged by revelation, understood as law and not\nas knowledge, on moral grounds.\n",
