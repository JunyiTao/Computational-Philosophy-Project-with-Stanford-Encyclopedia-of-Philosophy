    "main_text": "Connexive logics and consequential logics\n6. Summary\n\nIn summary, it may be said that connexive logic, although it is\ncontra-classical and unusual in various respects, is not just a formal\ngame or gimmick. There are several kinds of systems of connexive\nlogics with different kinds of semantics and proof systems, and in the\n21st century the subject has been experiencing a renaissance. The\nintuitions captured by systems of connexive logic can be traced back\nto ancient roots, and applications of connexive logics range from\nAristotle\u2019s syllogistic to Categorial Grammar, the study of\ncausal implications, and connexive mathematics. \n",
