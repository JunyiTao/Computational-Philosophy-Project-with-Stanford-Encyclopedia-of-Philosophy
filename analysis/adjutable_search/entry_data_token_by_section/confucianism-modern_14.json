    "main_text": "Political Thought || Democracy through Self-Restriction of Morality\n5.1 Democracy through Self-Restriction of Morality\n\nMou Zongsan\u2019s political thought features two important\ninnovations. The first is his idea of an indirect or dialectical\nconnection between Confucian ethical thought and democracy. The\nsecond, closely related, is the belief that objective, democratic\ninstitutions are necessary to make possible the Confucian ideal of\nsagely rulership. This is how Mou addresses the complete absence of\ndemocratic institutions in the history of Confucian thought while\nstill arguing for their importance.\n\nMou argued that traditional Confucianism failed by assuming too tight\na relationship between ethics and politics. He distinguishes two types\nof connections between them: direct (zhitong\n\u76f4\u901a) and indirect (qutong \u66f2\u901a).\nDeveloping democracy requires an indirect connection (MZCW 10:\n61\u201362). In politics, direct connection is between a virtuous\nleader and moral politics: the belief that a morally good ruler is\nnecessary and sufficient for good government. Politics cannot be\nlinked so closely to morality and needs to have some independence (Lee\n2017: 85). The way Mou justifies this is through his famous concept of\nself-restriction (or self-negation) (ziwo kanxian\n\u81ea\u6211\u574e\u9677) (MZCW 10: 64). Morality has to limit\nitself to allow for the development of amoral political\nstructures.\n\nThe moral reasoning at the foundation of Confucian thought must\nrestrict itself to allow for the development of theoretical or\nconstructive reason so politics can be partly separated from morality.\nDemocracy is not a moral system. Elections are not limited to the\nvirtuous. In the traditional ideal of sagely rulers and worthy\nministers, government is not independent from morality, as the\npossibility of good government depends on moral rulers and officials.\nHowever, traditional Confucian thought had no system to transmit power\nreliably only to sages and worthies. That system was inherently\nunstable. In democracy, political virtue is embodied in objective\nstructures, not individuals. Realizing morality in politics thus\ndemands moral reason restrict itself so theoretical reason can\ndevelop, as only theoretical reason can produce value-neutral\ndemocratic institutions (MZCW 10: 65, 151\u201352). This indirect\nconnection between morality and politics realizes moral goals better\nthan a direct connection can.\n\nThe philosophical foundation for democracy is Mengzi\u2019s doctrine\nthat human nature is good. Mou argues that democracy is in fact\nnecessary to realize the goal of Confucian morality, to allow each\nperson to realize their good nature. However, we must be precise about\nthe kind of necessity this is. It is not logical necessity. There is\nno logical contradiction in an autocratic government allowing people\nto realize the goodness of human nature. It simply does not often work\nout. The necessity Mou talks about is dialectical or practical. It is\na question of what kind of government is most likely to make possible\nthe goal of realizing Confucian morality.\n",
