    "main_text": "Iamblichus\u2019 System || Lower entities\n3.3 Lower entities\n\nThrough a comparison between Julian and Proclus (see Lecerf 2012), one\nmay conclude that Iamblichus had conceived of a variety of Demiurges,\nthe main one (identified with Zeus) acting as a principle or\n\u201cmonad\u201d for the others. While Zeus creates the world\ninsofar as it is governed by rational laws and populated with beings\npertaining to species and genera (themselves of intelligible nature),\nother demiurgic entities are tasked with informing matter and bodies\n(which undergo a process of generation and corruption) according to\nsuch laws.\n\nIamblichus already uses the terminology \u201chypercosmic\u201d vs.\n\u201cencosmic\u201d or \u201cpericosmic\u201d (e.g., Reply to\nPorphyry VIII, 8 [SS-2013: 200.25\u201327]), inherited from\nMiddle Platonism but destined to become technical in later\nNeoplatonism. In anticipation of this later use, they are meant to\nbridge the gap between the Demiurge and the sublunar realm, although\ntheir exact role in Iamblichus remains unclear (the aforementioned\npassage speaks of the help they give to souls in their ascent). Such\nlower entities seem to be produced according to a geometric\nprogression (cf. In Timaeum [D-1973: Fr. 79]). The\nterminological continuity allows one to conceive of Iamblichus\u2019\nsystem as the matrix for later variations, particularly Proclus\u2019\none, although it is to be noted that no text bears witness to the\npresence of Proclus\u2019 intermediate\n\u201cintelligible-intellective\u201d and\n\u201chypercosmic-encosmic\u201d levels in Iamblichus.\n\nThe hierarchies of \u201chigher genera\u201d will be considered in\n Section 6.1.\n",
