    "main_text": "The Second Sex || The Body and Others\n2.3 The Body and Others\n\nThe way in which the young girl and then the woman experiences her\nbody is, for Beauvoir, a consequence of a process of internalizing the\nview of it under the gaze of others. \n\n\nThrough compliments and admonishments, through images and words, she\ndiscovers the meaning of the words pretty and ugly; she soon knows\nthat to be pleased is to be pretty as a picture; she tries to resemble\nan image, she disguises herself, she looks at herself in the mirror,\nshe compares herself to princesses and fairies from tales. (1949\n[2010: 304]) \n\n\nHere is the beginning of the way in which women live their bodies as\nobjects for another\u2019s gaze, something which has its origin not\nin anatomy but in \u201ceducation and surroundings\u201d (1949\n[2010: 304]). Beauvoir\u2019s account of the way in which women live\ntheir bodies in such an objectified way, internalizing the gaze and\nproducing their bodies as objects for others, has been one of her most\nimportant contributions to a phenomenology of female embodiment,\nanticipating and influencing the work of later feminists such as\nBartky and Young (see below sections 5.1 and 7.1)   .\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s phenomenology of women\u2019s experience was also,\nitself, influential on, and in conversation with, philosophers\ntheorizing raced embodiment. The phenomenological writer Franz Fanon,\n(Black Skins White Masks, 1952 [1968]) describes how, on his\narrival in France, he discovers his blackness: \n\n\nI discovered myself as an object among other objects\u2026the other\nfixes me, just like a dye is used to fix a chemical\nsolution\u2026.It is not a question of the Black being black\nanymore, but rather of his being Black opposite the White\u2026we\ncame to have to confront the white gaze \u2026. I was all at once\nresponsible for my body, responsible for my race, for my ancestors. I\nran an objective gaze over myself, discovering my blackness, my ethnic\ncharacteristics and then I was deafened by cannibalism, intellectual\ndeficiency fetishism, racial defects, slave ships, and above all,\nabove all else, \u201cSho good Banana\u201d. (1952 [1968:\n185\u2013186]) \n\n\nLater theorists have, however, pointed out that in, offering her own\naccount, Beauvoir herself failed to recognize the way in which both\nrace and gender intersect in providing a phenomenology of\nlived corporeality (Gines 2017; see the discussion of\nintersectionality in\n section 4 below).\n",
