    "main_text": "Preclassical Period || Yamaka\n2.1 Yamaka\n\nThe Yamaka (Couplets) is the sixth of the seven\nworks comprising the Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma. Were it printed in its\nentirety, it would be run to some 2,500 pages, according to von\nHin\u00fcber (1996, II.3.6). The printed editions are therefore highly\nabridged.\n\nThe Yamaka comprises ten chapters, most with up to three\nsections. Each chapter asks for various pairs, or yamakas, of\nterms falling under the chapter\u2019s rubric whether or not the\ncorresponding universal categorical proposition holds. Here is chapter\n2, section 1, in schematic form:\n\n\n\n1.1 Are all M MA?\n5.1 Are all -M -MA? \n\n1.2 Are all MA M?\n5.2 Are all -MA -M? \n\n2.1 Are all M MA?\n6.1 Are all -M -MA? \n\n2.2 Are all A SA?\n6.2 Are all -SA -A? \n\n3.1 Are all M A?\n7.1 Are all -M -A? \n\n3.2 Are all A M?\n7.2 Are all -A -MA? \n\n4.1 Are all M A?\n8.1 Are all -M -A? \n\n4.2 Are all A SA?\n8.2 Are all -A -SA?  \n\n\nwhere M is matter, A is aggregate, MA is matter-aggregate and SA\nsensation aggregate. We note the repetition in 1.1 and 2.1, 3.1 and\n4.1, 2.2 and 4.2, 5.1 and 6.2, 7.1 and 8.1 as well as in 6.2 and 8.2.\nWe also notice that 1.1 and 5.2 are contrapositives, as are 1.2 and\n5.1. Though the text contains no arguments, the fact that the same\nform of question is reinstantiated again and again reveals an\nawareness of the importance of linguistic form, an essential aspect of\nreasoning. However, while the systematicity of the text is evident,\nits logical point definitely is not.\n",
