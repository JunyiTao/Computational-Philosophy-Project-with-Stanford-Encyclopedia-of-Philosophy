    "main_text": "The Completeness Question || Supervenience and Necessity Physicalism\n2.1 Supervenience and Necessity Physicalism\n\nThe idea of supervenience has its origins in meta-ethics but was\nimported into philosophy of mind mainly by Davidson 1970; for a\nsurvey, see\n supervenience.\n For our purposes, the general idea might be introduced via an example\ndue to David Lewis of a dot-matrix picture:\n\nA dot-matrix picture has global properties \u2014 it is symmetrical,\nit is cluttered, and whatnot \u2014 and yet all there is to the\npicture is dots and non-dots at each point of the matrix. The global\nproperties are nothing but patterns in the dots. They supervene: no\ntwo pictures could differ in their global properties without\ndiffering, somewhere, in whether there is or there isn\u2019t a dot\n(1986, p. 14).\n\n\nThis gives us one way to think about the basic idea of physicalism.\nThe basic idea is that the physical features of the world are like the\ndots in the picture, and the psychological or biological or social\nfeatures of the world are like the global properties of the picture.\nJust as the global features of the picture supervene on the dots, so\ntoo everything supervenes on the physical, if physicalism is true.\n\nIt is desirable to have a more explicit statement of physicalism, and\nhere too Lewis\u2019s example gives us direction. He says that, in\nthe case of the picture, supervenience means that \u201cno two\npictures can be identical in the arrangement of dots but different in\ntheir global properties\u201d. Similarly, one might say that, in the\ncase of physicalism, no two possible worlds can be identical in their\nphysical properties but differ, somewhere, in their mental, social or\nbiological properties. To weaken this slightly, we might say that if\nphysicalism is the case at our world \u2013 that is, is true of\nour universe and everything in it \u2013 then no other world can\nbe physically identical to our world without being identical to it in\nall respects. This suggests the following general account of what\nphysicalism is (in the following formulation and in subsequent ones,\nwe use \u201ciff\u201d to abbreviate \u201cif and only\nif\u201d):\n\n(1)\n Physicalism is true at a possible world w iff any world\nwhich is a physical duplicate of w is a duplicate of\nw simpliciter.\n\n\nIf physicalism is construed along the lines suggested in (1), we have\nan answer to the completeness question. The completeness question\nasks: what relation does everything bear to the physical if\nphysicalism is true?  According to (1), the answer is that everything\nmust supervene on the physical; or, to put it more technically, there\nis no possible world which is identical to our world in every physical\nrespect but which is not identical to it in a biological or social or\npsychological respect. It will be useful to have a name for\nphysicalism so defined, so let us call it supervenience\nphysicalism. \n\nSupervenience offers one modal formulation of physicalism, but it is\nworth taking note of a second modal formulation too. Suppose we say\nthat a property G is necessitated by a property F\njust in case, in all possible worlds, if something is F then\nit is G; in this sense, for example, being red necessitates\nbeing colored, and being square necessitates having some extension in\nspace. This suggests a formulation of physicalism along the following\nlines:\n\n(2)\n Physicalism is true at a possible world w iff every\nproperty instantiated at w is necessitated by a physical\nproperty.\n\n\nWhat is the relation between physicalism so defined, which we might\ncall necessity physicalism, and supervenience\nphysicalism? At least if necessitation is understood as a sort of\nentailment, then these are not equivalent; for discussion of this\npoint, see\n supervenience.\n However, (1) and (2) are clearly similar, in particular they are\nmodal formulations of physicalism. In what follows we will concentrate\non supervenience physicalism, but what we will say will apply also to\nnecessity physicalism.\n\nSupervenience physicalism was for many years the dominant version of\nphysicalism; perhaps because of this, many different problems have\nbeen raised for it; some of these problems are discussed in the\nsupplement on:\n\nSupervenience Physicalism: Further Issues\n\n\nBut the most influential objection to supervenience physicalism (and\nto modal formulations generally) is what might be called the\nsufficiency problem. This alleges that, while (1) articulates a\nnecessary condition for physicalism it does not provide a sufficient\ncondition. The underlying rationale is that, intuitively one thing can\nsupervene on another and yet be of a completely different nature. To\nuse Fine\u2019s famous (1994) example, consider the difference between\nSocrates and his singleton set, the set that contains only Socrates as\na member. The facts about the set supervene on the facts about\nSocrates; any world that is like ours in respect of the existence of\nSocrates is like ours in respect of the existence of his singleton\nset. And yet the set is quite different from Socrates. This in turn\nraises the possibility that something might be of a completely\ndifferent nature from the physical and nevertheless supervene on\nit.\n\nOne may bring out this objection further by considering positions in\nphilosophy which entail supervenience and yet deny physicalism. A good\nexample is necessitation dualism, which is an approach that\nweaves together elements of both physicalism and its traditional\nrival, dualism. On the one hand, the necessitation dualist wants to\nsay that mental facts and physical facts are metaphysically\ndistinct\u2014just as a standard dualist does. On the other hand, the\nnecessitation dualist wants to agree with the physicalist that mental\nfacts are necessitated by, and supervene on, the physical facts. If\nthis sort of position is coherent, (1) does not articulate a\nsufficient condition for physicalism. For if necessitation dualism is\ntrue, any physical duplicate of the actual world is a duplicate\nsimpliciter. And yet, if dualism of any sort is true,\nincluding necessitation dualism, physicalism is false.\n\nHow to respond to the sufficiency problem? Some respond by denying the\ncoherence of the position that causes the problem. Necessitation\ndualism as we have just described it violates (what is known as)\nHume\u2019s dictum that there are no necessary connections between\ndistinct existences. According to necessitation dualism, mental and\nphysical properties are metaphysically distinct, and yet are\nnecessarily connected. However, Hume\u2019s dictum is itself a matter\nof controversy (see Jackson 1993, Stalnaker 1996, Stoljar 2010, and\nWilson 2005, 2010). Another approach appeals to a priori physicalism\nwhich will examine below (see Jackson 2006). But by far the most\ncommon response has been to concede that the sufficiency problem shows\nthat supervenience formulation of physicalism is too weak (e.g. Kim\n1998), and to look for an alternative. \n",
