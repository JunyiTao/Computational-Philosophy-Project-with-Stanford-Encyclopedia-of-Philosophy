    "main_text": "Varieties of Non-Evidentialism || Practical non-evidentialism\n6.1 Practical non-evidentialism\n\nAs noted above, William James famously sniffs at the impracticable\nstringency of Clifford's Principle, advocating instead the more\nliberal policy that we sometimes have the \u201cright to\nbelieve\u201d even when we lack sufficient evidence (and even when we\nknow that we lack it). In places, James goes further and\nsuggests that in certain cases\u2014especially cases involving\nreligious and moral belief\u2014it is not merely permitted but\npositively commendable or even required that we\nbelieve on insufficient evidence.\n\nWhen I look at the religious question as it really puts itself to\nconcrete men, and when I think of all the possibilities which both\npractically and theoretically it involves, then this command that we\nshall put a stopper on our heart, instincts, and courage, and\nwait\u2014acting of course meanwhile more or less as if\nreligion were not true\u2014till doomsday, or till such time\nas our intellect and sense working together may have raked in evidence\nenough,\u2014this command, I say, seems to me the queerest idol ever\nmanufactured in the philosophic cave. (1896, 11)\n\n\nWe saw earlier that there are difficult conceptual and psychological\nproblems facing an ethics of belief that says, quite strictly, that we\nmust always and only believe what is prudentially beneficial. Thus\nwhile pragmatism is sometimes characterized casually as the view that\nwe should believe whatever \u201cworks,\u201d most self-described\npragmatists are very careful to specify the conditions under which a\nsubject can reasonably depart from, ignore, or go beyond her evidence\n(see\n pragmatism).\n These conditions typically involve the absence of really compelling\nevidence; thus, as James reminds his reader, pragmatic belief is not\nsimply wild-eyed believing \u201cwhat you know ain't true\u201d\n(1896, 29). Pragmatists also typically require the existence of some\nsort of exigency or \u201cpassional\u201d interest on the part of\nthe subject that makes suspension of belief in that context impossible\n(or at least exceedingly ill-advised). We saw earlier how James\ndefines a \u201cgenuine option\u201d in an effort to specify these\nconditions.\n\nThe emphasis on the \u201cprimacy of the practical\u201d in James\nwas clearly anticipated by earlier ethicists of belief. Blaise Pascal\nfamously argues in the Pens\u00e9es that wager-like\nreasoning should lead us to set the goal of believing in God; thus his\nfocus tends to be less on the moral or epistemic and more on the\nprudential motives for belief (Pascal 1670, H\u00e1jek 2003, Jordan\n2006; see also the entries on\n Pascal,\n Pascal's Wager, and\n pragmatic arguments and belief in God).\n For Immanuel Kant, by contrast, considerations that can justify\nbelief (or faith) in the absence of sufficient theoretical evidence\nare typically (though not exclusively) moral. If, for\ninstance, there is no sufficient evidence one way or the other for a\ncertain proposition p (the proposition, say, that the human\nwill is incompatibilistically free), and if one has set a moral end\nthat requires one to take a stand on the truth of p, and if\nany evidence that one does have points in the direction of the truth\nof p, then one is permitted (and sometimes even required) to\ntake p to be true. This \u2018taking-to-be-true\u2019\n(German: \u2018F\u00fcrwahrhalten\u2019) is thereby\njustified on \u201cmoral\u201d rather than \u201ctheoretical\u201d\ngrounds, and it counts as \u201cbelief\u201d (Glaube) or\n\u201cacceptance\u201d (Annehmung) rather than\n\u201cknowledge\u201d (Wissen) (Kant 1781/1787, Chignell\n2007).\n\nA convenient label that captures both broadly pragmatist and broadly\nKantian theories is Practical Non-Evidentialism, where the\npragmatic/prudential and the moral are the two main species of\n\u201cpractical\u201d value (for more on moral reasons for belief\nand whether they count as evidence see Pace 2010; for a survey of the\ndebate about pragmatic reasons for belief see Reisner 2017).\n",
