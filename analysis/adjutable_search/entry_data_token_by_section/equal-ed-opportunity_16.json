However, when we are concerned with\nequality of opportunity we may be concerned that each individual has\nthe same opportunities or that certain groups (classified by race,\ngender, socio-economic class, sexuality or religion) have the same\nopportunities. In other words, our concern may be that people\u2019s\nopportunities are not affected by their membership of some\ndisadvantaged group rather than being concerned that each individual\nhas equal opportunity within groups. Imagine two societies. In society\nA, all those who gain entrance to selective colleges on the\nbasis of test scores are white. In society B, all those who\ngain entrance on the basis of test scores are white or non-white in\nproportionate to their percentages in the overall population. Should\nwe care about whether we are in society A or B? If\nour concern is with individuals alone, then so long as our conception\nof equality of opportunity is met, then there is no difference between\nsociety A and B. Of course, we may suspect that\nsociety A violates our conception of equality of opportunity.\nBut suppose that it does not.\n\nDo we have any reason to favor a college admissions policy that moves\nus from A to B? Those who advocate for affirmative\naction in admissions argue that we have reason to depart from a\ncolor-blind standard. Some of those arguments appeal to the\nillegitimacy of the standards used (e.g., tests scores), which critics\nsay are biased. Others argue that we should expect to see equality of\noutcomes with respect to relevant social groups. For example, John\nRoemer (1998) defends a conception of equality of opportunity\naccording to which members of groups that have been subordinated\n(women, racial minorities) should have the same probabilities of\nachieving success as the members of the dominant group. This is\nbecause he thinks the obstacles these groups face should be the same\nand if we assume that they have equal distributions of talent within\nthem, then different outcomes means there are different obstacles.\nRoemer uses the example of smoking to illustrate this. Smoking rates\nvary by social class: the poorer you are, the more likely it is that\nyou will smoke. On Roemer\u2019s view, this means that it is harder\nfor a poor person to stop smoking than a wealthy person. So we should\nnot penalize a poor person who smokes to the same extent that we\npenalize a wealthy person. Of course, which social groups should be\nincluded in this exercise is controversial. Conservatives and liberals\ndiffer as to whether individuals face different obstacles simply by\nvirtue of their group membership.\n\nA different argument for moving to society B is given by\nGlenn Loury (1987) who argues that the dynamic effects of a society\nlike A would prevent poor but talented minorities from\nachieving equality of educational opportunity because they would lack\naccess to the social networks upon which jobs and other opportunities\ndepend. In society A, disadvantages would cluster. Because\nequality of opportunity does not, as we have seen, easily extend to\nthe private sphere of family and intimate associations, it is\ncompatible with the continued practice of racial discrimination in\nsuch practices, even when there is legal, formal equality.\n\nLoury thus sees a role for preferential policies in higher education\nthat would move us from a society like A to a society like\nB. One of the more controversial reforms associated with\nhigher education and equality of opportunity is affirmative action,\nwhich reserves preferential treatment for historically disadvantaged\ngroups. Affirmative action has been criticized by those who think that\nmerit, and not race or class, should be the only criterion for\nselecting college applicants. Others argue that it can lead to the\nunintended stigmatization of members of disadvantaged groups who\nattend college as not deserving of their place. However, this is to\nforget that opportunities to develop merit are themselves unfairly\ndistributed between groups historically. Notwithstanding this\nresponse, affirmative action remains a controversial response to a\nvery difficult social problem (Guinier 2016).\n",
