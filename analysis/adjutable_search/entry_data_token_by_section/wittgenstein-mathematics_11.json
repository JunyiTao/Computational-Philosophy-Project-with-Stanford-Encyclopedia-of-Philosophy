    "main_text": "The Later Wittgenstein on Mathematics: Some Preliminaries || The Later Wittgenstein on Decidability and Algorithmic Decidability\n3.3 The Later Wittgenstein on Decidability and Algorithmic Decidability\n\nOn one fairly standard interpretation, the later Wittgenstein says\nthat \u201ctrue in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d is identical to\n\u201cprovable in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d and, therefore, that a\nmathematical proposition of calculus \\(\\Gamma\\) is a concatenation of\nsigns that is either provable (in principle) or refutable (in\nprinciple) in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\) (Goodstein 1972: 279, 282; Anderson\n1958: 487; Klenk 1976: 13; Frascolla 1994: 59). On this\ninterpretation, the later Wittgenstein precludes undecidable\nmathematical propositions, but he allows that some undecided\nexpressions are propositions of a calculus because they are\ndecidable in principle (i.e., in the absence of a known, applicable\ndecision procedure).\n\nThere is considerable evidence, however, that the later Wittgenstein\nmaintains his intermediate position that an expression is a meaningful\nmathematical proposition only within a given calculus and\niff we knowingly have in hand an applicable and effective\ndecision procedure by means of which we can decide it. For example,\nthough Wittgenstein vacillates between \u201cprovable in PM\u201d\nand \u201cproved in PM\u201d at (RFM App. III, \u00a76,\n\u00a78), he does so in order to use the former to consider the\nalleged conclusion of G\u00f6del\u2019s proof (i.e., that there exist\ntrue but unprovable mathematical propositions), which he then rebuts\nwith his own identification of \u201ctrue in calculus\n\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d with \u201cproved in calculus\n\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d (i.e., not with \u201cprovable in\ncalculus \\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d) (Wang 1991: 253; Rodych 1999a: 177). This\nconstrual is corroborated by numerous passages in which Wittgenstein\nrejects the received view that a provable but unproved\nproposition is true, as he does when he asserts that (RFM\nIII, \u00a731, 1939) a proof \u201cmakes new connexions\u201d,\n\u201c[i]t does not establish that they are there\u201d because\n\u201cthey do not exist until it makes them\u201d, and when he says\n(RFM VII, \u00a710, 1941) that \u201c[a] new proof gives the\nproposition a place in a new system\u201d. Furthermore, as we have\njust seen, Wittgenstein rejects PIC as a non-proposition on the\ngrounds that it is not algorithmically decidable, while admitting\nfinitistic versions of PIC because they are algorithmically\ndecidable.\n\nPerhaps the most compelling evidence that the later Wittgenstein\nmaintains algorithmic decidability as his criterion for a mathematical\nproposition lies in the fact that, at (RFM V, \u00a79, 1942),\nhe says in two distinct ways that a mathematical\n\u2018question\u2019 can become decidable and that when\nthis happens, a new connexion is \u2018made\u2019\nwhich previously did not exist. Indeed, Wittgenstein cautions us\nagainst appearances by saying that \u201cit looks as if a\nground for the decision were already there\u201d, when, in fact,\n\u201cit has yet to be invented\u201d. These passages strongly\nmilitate against the claim that the later Wittgenstein grants that\nproposition \\(\\phi\\) is decidable in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\) iff it is\nprovable or refutable in principle. Moreover, if Wittgenstein\nheld this position, he would claim, contra (RFM V,\n\u00a79), that a question or proposition does not become\ndecidable since it simply (always) is decidable. If it is\nprovable, and we simply don\u2019t yet know this to be the case,\nthere already is a connection between, say, our axioms and\nrules and the proposition in question. What Wittgenstein says,\nhowever, is that the modalities provable and\nrefutable are shadowy forms of reality\u2014that possibility\nis not actuality in mathematics (PR \u00a7\u00a7141, 144,\n172; PG 281, 283, 299, 371, 466, 469; LFM 139).\nThus, the later Wittgenstein agrees with the intermediate Wittgenstein\nthat the only sense in which an undecided mathematical\nproposition (RFM VII, \u00a740, 1944) can be\ndecidable is in the sense that we know how to decide\nit by means of an applicable decision procedure.\n",
