One answer is\nthat insofar as the cogito is the first cognition noticed to\nresist any efforts at a direct doubt, it can be said to play\nan Archimedean role. For it exemplifies the kind of cognitions the\nmeditator thereafter employs, in all subsequent constructive efforts\nto overcome the sceptical problem.\n\nDescartes indeed uses the cogito to clarify the epistemically\nprivileged status of clear and distinct perception, even formulating\nclarity and distinctness as underwriting a general rule for\ndiscovering truth. The passage occurs in the second paragraph of the\nThird Meditation:\n\nIn this first item of knowledge there is simply a clear and distinct\nperception of what I am asserting; this would not be enough to make me\ncertain of the truth of the matter if it could ever turn out that\nsomething which I perceived with such clarity and distinctness was\nfalse. So I now seem [videor] to be able to lay it down as a\ngeneral rule that whatever I perceive very clearly and distinctly is\ntrue. (AT 7:35, CSM 2:24)\n\n\nI shall refer to this general rule the \u2018C&D Rule\u2019.\nThough interpretations differ, the context of the passage indicates\nthe rule is treated as provisional \u2013 i.e., further work\nwill be needed before the rule can be regarded as finally established.\nOn two counts, the announcement of the rule is carefully tinged with\ncaution, in anticipation of the revelation to come (two paragraphs\nlater) that even clearly and distinctly perceived matters are\nvulnerable to the Evil Genius Doubt. First, the passage notes that\nbeing clearly and distinctly perceived \u201cwould not be enough to\nmake me certain of the truth of the matter,\u201d if the truth of\nsuch matters could be undermined. Second, the announcement includes an\nimportant qualification, in saying that it does \u201cnow seem\u201d\n(videor) that this is a justified rule. Because it soon\nemerges that the Evil Genius Doubt undermines the veracity of the\nC&D Rule, Descartes assumes the burden of trying to establish \nthe rule \u2013 a proof he takes to occur not in this early Third\nMeditation passage, but only later, after having argued for an\nall-perfect God: Descartes writes that it is \u201cin the Fourth \nMeditation [that] it is proved that everything that we clearly and \ndistinctly perceive is true\u201d (Synopsis, AT 7:15, CSM 2:11).\n (Section 5.3\n discusses Descartes\u2019 Fourth Meditation argument for the C&D\nRule.)\n5.2 Strategy for Constructive Proofs \nMoving Forward\n\nIf even clear and distinct perception is subject to doubt, how is\nthe meditator to make progress? How can he construct arguments in\nthe effort to solve the sceptical problem? This brings into focus\nthe issue of whether Descartes\u2019 procedure is viciously\ncircular. For it seems that in the very process of\narguing for a truth rule, he is already employing that \nvery rule. For now, we\u2019ll set to the side the issue of \ncircularity (returning to it in\n Section 6).\n\nIn his strategy for making constructive arguments, Descartes builds on\nthe fact that clearly and distinctly perceived matters appear to us to\nbe utterly conclusive, i.e., while our perception is clear and\ndistinct. So, by employing none other than premises and reasoning that\nare clearly and distinctly perceived, we can \u2013 in some sense\n\u2013 make rational progress, notwithstanding that those very same \nproofs fall vulnerable to indirect doubt, once our attention is no \nlonger clear and distinct. The following Fifth Meditation passage illustrates the point:\n\nAdmittedly my nature is such that so long as I perceive something very\nclearly and distinctly I cannot but believe it to be true. But my\nnature is also such that I cannot fix my mental vision continually on\nthe same thing, so as to keep perceiving it clearly; and often the\nmemory of a previously made judgement may come back, when I am no\nlonger attending to the arguments which led me to make it. And so\nother arguments can now occur to me which might easily undermine my\nopinion, if I were unaware of [the true] God; and I should thus never\nhave true and certain knowledge about anything, but only shifting and\nchangeable opinions. For example, when I consider the nature of a\ntriangle, it appears most evident to me, steeped as I am in the\nprinciples of geometry, that its three angles are equal to two right\nangles; and so long as I attend to the proof, I cannot but believe\nthis to be true. But as soon as I turn my mind\u2019s eye away from\nthe proof, then in spite of still remembering that I perceived it very\nclearly, I can easily fall into doubt about its truth, if I am unaware\nof God. For I can convince myself that I have a natural disposition to\ngo wrong from time to time in matters which I think I perceive as\nevidently as can be. (Med. 5, AT 7:69f, CSM 2:48; cf. AT 3:64f; AT\n8a:9f).\n\n\nOf course, Descartes will need some sort of final solution to the\nproblem of ongoing indirect doubt. In the meantime, he has his\nmeditator attempting to move forward, by constructing clearly and\ndistinctly perceived anti-sceptical arguments.\n\nThe broader argumentative strategy is revealed at the end of the\npivotal fourth paragraph of the Third Meditation: \u201cin order to\nremove even this slight reason for doubt, as soon as the opportunity\narises I must examine whether there is a God, and, if there is,\nwhether he can be a deceiver.\u201d So, in the effort to establish\nthe C&D Rule, the meditator makes arguments to the conclusion that\nhis creator is not an evil genius, but an all-perfect creator who\nwould not allow him to be deceived about what he clearly and\ndistinctly perceives.\n\nThe broader argument encompasses two main steps. The first main\nstep involves Third Meditation arguments for the existence of an\nall-perfect God. From these arguments the meditator concludes:\n\nI recognize that it would be impossible for me to exist with the\nkind of nature I have \u2013 that is, having within me the idea\nof God \u2013 were it not the case that God really existed. By\n\u2018God\u2019 I mean the very being the idea of whom is within me,\nthat is, the possessor of all the perfections which I cannot grasp,\nbut can somehow reach in my thought, who is subject to no defects\nwhatsoever. It is clear enough from this that he cannot be a deceiver,\nsince it is manifest by the natural light that all fraud and deception\ndepend on some defect. (Med. 3, AT 7:51f, CSM 2:35)\n\n\nThere is much of interest in Descartes\u2019 Third Meditation\narguments for an all-perfect creator God. (Note that the Fifth\nMeditation advances a further argument for God.) In the interests\nof space, and of focusing on epistemological concerns, however,\nthese arguments will not be considered here. (For an overview of\nDescartes\u2019 proofs, see Nolan 2014 and Nolan & Nelson\n2006.)\n\nThe second main step involves an argument from the premise (now\nestablished) that an all-perfect God exists, to the general veracity\nof the C&D Rule \u2013 whereby, whatever is clearly and\ndistinctly perceived is guaranteed to be true. It is this second\nmain step of the broader argument to which we now turn. (As will\nemerge, a yet further, third step is required on some\ninterpretations.)\n5.3 Fourth Meditation Proof of the C&D Rule\n\nIt might seem that a separate argument for the C&D Rule is\nunneeded \u2013 that having demonstrated a non-deceiving God, the\nveracity of the rule is a straightforward consequence. But this is too\nfast. Why should only the C&D Rule be a straightforward\nconsequence, but not also a more general infallibility of all\nour judgments? Essentially this point is made in the First Meditation,\nat the introduction of the Evil Genius Doubt. As we saw, the meditator\nthere observes that what seems to follow from the standard view\n\u2013 whereby God \u201cis said to be supremely good,\u201d rather\nthan a deceiver \u2013 is that God would not allow us ever\nto be mistaken in our judgments:\n\nBut if it were inconsistent with his goodness to have created me such\nthat I am deceived all the time, it would seem equally foreign to his\ngoodness to allow me to be deceived even occasionally; yet this last\nassertion cannot be made. (Med. 1, AT 7:21, CSM 2:14)\n\n\nIn short, the most straightforward consequence of an all-perfect\ncreator would seem to be the universal rule: If I form a judgment,\nthen it is true. Yet quite clearly, this rule\ndoesn\u2019t hold. What emerges is an instance of the problem of\nevil, here applied to judgment error. As the passage reasons:\n\nJudgment error occurs.\nThat judgment error occurs is incompatible with the hypothesis\nthat I am the creation of an all-perfect God.\nTherefore, I am not the creation of an all-perfect God.\n\n\nThese First Meditation remarks set the stage for the discussion\nthat comes in the Fourth Meditation. Descartes needs a theodicy\nfor error \u2013 theodicy being an effort to explain how\nan all-perfect God is compatible with evil. The theodicy needs to\nshow that the existence of such a God is compatible with some forms\nof judgment error, but not others; somehow, God allows error in our \nsensory judgments, while guaranteeing the inerrancy of judgments\nbased on clear and distinct perception. In contrast with the First \nMeditation setting, the context of the Fourth Meditation comes on\nthe heels of a demonstration of the existence of an all-perfect\nGod. The argument of the Fourth Meditation thus begins by reviewing\nthe problem where the First Meditation left it, but in the light of\nthe meditator\u2019s newfound conclusion \u2013 \u201cto begin\nwith, I recognize that it is impossible that God should ever deceive \nme.\u201d The passage continues:\n\nNext, I know by experience that there is in me a\nfaculty of judgement which, like everything else which is in me, I\ncertainly received from God. And since God does not wish to deceive\nme, he surely did not give me the kind of faculty which would ever\nenable me to go wrong while using it correctly.\nThere would be no further doubt on this issue\nwere it not that what I have just said appears to imply that I am\nincapable of ever going wrong. For if everything that is in me comes\nfrom God, and he did not endow me with a faculty for making mistakes,\nit appears that I can never go wrong. (Med. 4, AT 7:53f, CSM 2:37f)\n\n\nSeeking to resolve the problem, the meditator investigates the\ncauses of error. In the course of the discussion, Descartes puts \nforward his theory whereby judgment arises from the cooperation\nof the intellect and the will: the role of the \nintellect is to consider a perceptual content \u2013 i.e.,\nsomething seeming to be the case, thereby functioning as a\npossible judgment; the role of the will is to give assent (or\ndissent), or withhold assent, to the perceptual content under \nconsideration.\n\nThe investigation concludes that the blameworthy cause of error\nlies in our improper use of our free will. Neither the intellect\nnor the will is inherently defective (though each is, of course,\nfinite), nor is there inherent defect in the design of how they \ncooperate \u2013 i.e., their design does not render error\ninevitable. The design does make for the possibility of error,\nin that \u201cthe scope of the will is wider than that of the \nintellect\u201d: my will is able to assent to further matters\nthan just those that I clearly and distinctly understand; \u201cbut \ninstead of restricting it within the same limits, I extend its use\nto matters which I do not understand\u201d (AT 7:58, CSM 2:40).\nIn short, actual mistakes of judgment arise from user error:\n\n[If] I simply refrain from making a judgement in cases where I do not\nperceive the truth with sufficient clarity and distinctness, then it\nis clear that I am behaving correctly and avoiding error. But if in\nsuch cases I either affirm or deny, then I am not using my free will\ncorrectly. (Med. 4, AT 7:59, CSM 2:41)\n\n\nThe theodicy that emerges is a version of the free will defense.\nAccordingly, we should thank God for giving us free will, but the cost\nof having free will is the possibility of misusing it. Since error is\nthe result of misusing our free will, we should not blame God.\n\nNot only is the theodicy used to explain the kinds of error God\ncan allow, it serves to clarify the kinds of error God\ncannot allow. From the latter arises a proof of the C&D\nRule. God can allow errors that are our fault, but not errors\nthat would be God\u2019s fault. On occasions when my\nperception is clear and distinct, my assent is involuntary and thus\nnot a result of a misuse of my free will. In such cases,\nassent is a necessary consequence of my cognitive nature \u2013 a\npoint made in many passages, as we\u2019ve seen: \u201cour mind is\nof such a nature that it cannot help assenting to what it clearly\nunderstands\u201d (AT 3:64, CSMK 147). Since, on occasions of clarity\nand distinctness, my assent is the unavoidable consequence of my\nGod-given cognitive nature, God would properly get the blame if those\njudgments resulted in error. Therefore, they are not in error; indeed\nthey could not be. That an evil genius might have created me\ncasts doubt on my clear and distinct judgments. That, instead, an\nall-perfect God created me guarantees that these judgments are true. A\nclever strategy of argument thus unfolds \u2013 effectively inverting\nthe usual reasoning in the problem of evil:\n\nI am the creation of an all-perfect God.\nThat I am the creation of an all-perfect God is incompatible with\nthe sceptical hypothesis that I am in error about what I clearly and\ndistinctly perceive.\nTherefore, I am not in error about what I clearly and distinctly\nperceive.\n\n\nThe first premise is argued in the Third Meditation. The second\npremise arises from the discussion of the Fourth Meditation. The\nresult is a divine guarantee of the C&D Rule. Whatever I perceive\nclearly and distinctly is guaranteed true, because I am the creature\nof an all-perfect God.\n\nIt might seem that, by the end of the Fourth Meditation, \nDescartes\u2019 broader case to overcome radical doubt is complete. \nAt that stage, the meditator is in position to reproduce a \ndemonstration \u2013 each step of which he clearly and distinctly \nperceives \u2013 which supports the grand conclusion that he\u2019s\nthe creation of an all-perfect God who would not allow him to be \nmistaken about whatever he perceives clearly and distinctly. However,\nthere are significant issues that must be addressed. Among the\nphilosophical concerns is that the demonstration itself looks \nsuspiciously circular \u2013 the so-called Cartesian Circle. A\nfurther issue arises in connection with the interpretation we\nhave been developing: for when the meditator is no longer clearly\nand distinctly perceiving the steps of the demonstration, the\ngrand conclusion can then be undermined by means of the Evil Genius\nDoubt; i.e., it would seem that perfect knowledge is not yet within\nthe meditator\u2019s grasp. Perhaps related is that at the close\nof the Fourth Meditation one finds no announcement of victory over\nthe Evil Genius Doubt; instead, the announcement comes at the end\nof the Fifth Meditation. But why? It is to such issues that we\nnow turn.\n\n6. Perfect Knowledge, Circularity, and Truth\n6.1 The Cartesian Circle\n\nStudents of philosophy can expect to be taught a longstanding\ninterpretation according to which Descartes\u2019 broader argument\nis viciously circular. He first argues from clearly and distinctly\nperceived premises to the conclusion that an all-perfect God exists;\nhe then argues from the premise that an all-perfect God exists to the\nconclusion that whatever is clearly and distinctly perceived is true.\nThe worry is that he presupposes the C&D Rule in the effort to\nprove the C&D Rule. Despite its prima facie plausibility,\nDescartes scholarship generally resists the vicious circularity\ninterpretation, based on numerous textual considerations. But even\nputting those texts to the side, it should be surprising that the\nproject would be viciously circular. As Thomas Lennon notes:\n\n[I]t would be nothing less than astonishing if the central argument\nof the central text of the central figure of the central period in\nthe history of philosophy were obviously circular. How could the\nfather of modern philosophy, the source of the epistemological turn, \nhave produced such an obviously loopy argument? (2008, 158)\n\n\nConsider first what every plausible interpretation must concede:\nthat the two main steps of the broader argument unfold in a manner\nsuggestive of a circle \u2013 let us indeed refer to them as\n\u2018arcs\u2019. The Third Meditation arguments for God define one\narc:\n\nArc 1: The conclusion that an all-perfect God exists\nis derived from premises that are clearly and distinctly perceived.\n\n\nThe Fourth Meditation argument defines a second arc:\n\nArc 2: The general veracity of propositions that are\nclearly and distinctly perceived (i.e., the C&D Rule) is derived\nfrom the conclusion that an all-perfect God exists.\n\n\nThat the broader argument unfolds in accord with these two steps is\nuncontroversial. The question of interest concerns whether, strictly\nspeaking, these arcs form an epistemic circle. The statement\nof Arc 1 admits of some ambiguity. How one resolves this ambiguity \ndetermines whether the arcs strictly form a circle. Let\u2019s begin \nby clarifying what Arc 1 would have to mean to generate vicious \ncircularity. We\u2019ll then consider the main alternative \ninterpretations of that arc by which commentators seek to avoid \ncircularity.\n\n\nVicious Circularity interpretation:\n\nArc 1: The conclusion that an all-perfect God exists\nis derived from premises that are clearly and distinctly perceived\n\u2013 i.e., premises that are accepted only because of having\nfirst accepted the general veracity of propositions that are clearly\nand distinctly perceived.\n\nArc 2: The general veracity of propositions that are\nclearly and distinctly perceived is derived from the conclusion that\nan all-perfect God exists.\n\n\nThus rendered, Descartes\u2019 broader argument is viciously\ncircular. The italicized segment of Arc 1 marks an addition to the\noriginal statement of it, thereby clarifying the circularity reading.\nInterpreted in this way, Descartes begins his Third Meditation proofs\nof God by presupposing the general veracity of clear and distinct\nperception. That is, he starts by assuming the C&D Rule and then\nuses the rule in the course of demonstrating it. Evidently, this way\nof reading Descartes\u2019 argument has pedagogical appeal, for it is\nwidely taught (outside of Descartes scholarship) despite the absence\nof serious textual merit. If there is one point of general agreement\nin the scholarly literature, it is that the texts do not sustain this\ninterpretation.\n\nHow then should Arc 1 be understood? There are multiple\ninterpretations that avoid vicious circularity, along with\nnumerous schemes for cataloguing them. For present purposes, \nwe\u2019ll catalogue the various accounts according to two\nmain kinds of non-circular strategies that commentators attribute\nto Descartes. (The secondary literature offers multiple variations\non each of these main kinds of interpretations, though the\nvariations won\u2019t here be explored. For further alternative \nschemes for cataloguing interpretations, see Hatfield 2006 and\nNewman & Nelson 1999. For an anthology devoted largely to the \nCartesian Circle, see Doney 1987.)\n\n\nBounded Doubt interpretations:\n\nArc 1: The conclusion that an all-perfect God exists\nis derived from premises that are clearly and distinctly perceived\n\u2013 indeed, premises belonging to a special class of truths\nthat are fully immune to doubt prior to establishing the general\nveracity of propositions that are clearly and distinctly\nperceived.\n\nArc 2: The general veracity of propositions that are\nclearly and distinctly perceived is derived from the conclusion that\nan all-perfect God exists.\n\n\nAgain, the italicized segment marks an addition to the original\nstatement of Arc 1. Call this a \u2018Bounded Doubt\u2019\ninterpretation, because this kind of interpretation construes\nhyperbolic doubt as bounded. More precisely, the Evil Genius\nDoubt is (on this reading) bounded in the sense that its sceptical\npotency does not extend to all judgments: a special class of truths is\noutside the bounds of doubt. Exemplary of this special class are the\ncogito and, importantly, the premises of the Third Meditation\nproofs of God. Propositions in this special class can be perfectly\nknown, even by atheists.\n\nOn this interpretation, there is no vicious circularity in the broader\nargument, because the truths serving as premises in the arguments for\nthe C&D Rule are perfectly knowable independently of that rule.\nThat is, throughout the arguments of Arcs 1 and 2, the premises\nemployed count as perfectly knowledge prior to the knowledge\nof the C&D Rule they help establish.\n\nProponents of this interpretation are apt to cite the Third Meditation\npassage distinguishing what\u2019s revealed by the natural\nlight, and what\u2019s taught by nature (see\n Section 4.3).\nIn order to extend perfect knowledge beyond the privileged class of\ntruths (revealed by the natural light), it is necessary to establish\nthe general veracity of the C&D Rule. Thus, the need (on this\ninterpretation) for Arc 2 in the broader project.\n\nThe other main kind of interpretation avoids circularity in a\ndifferent manner. Let\u2019s consider that alternative.\n\n\nUnbounded Doubt interpretations:\n\nArc 1: The conclusion that an all-perfect God exists\nis derived from premises that are clearly and distinctly perceived\n\u2013 i.e., premises that are accepted despite being vulnerable\nto Evil Genius Doubt, because our cognitive nature compels us to\nassent to clearly and distinctly perceived propositions.\n\nArc 2: The general veracity of propositions that are\nclearly and distinctly perceived is derived from the conclusion that\nan all-perfect God exists.\n\n\nAgain, the italicized segment marks an addition to the original\nstatement of Arc 1. Let\u2019s call this an \u2018Unbounded\nDoubt\u2019 interpretation, because this kind of interpretation\nconstrues hyperbolic doubt as unbounded. More precisely,\nthe Evil Genius Doubt is (on this reading) unbounded in the sense\nthat it undermines all manner of judgments \u2013 even\nthe cogito, even the premises of the Third Meditation\nproofs of God \u2013 when the mind is no longer attending to them \nclearly and distinctly. Insofar as the meditator assents to the\nsteps of these proofs, he does so not because of having an \nunderstanding of clear and distinct perceptions as being guaranteed \ntrue, but because the mind cannot but assent to them \nwhile attending clearly and distinctly.\n\nImportantly, if doubt is thus unbounded there is no circularity. For,\non this reading of Arc 1, the arguments therein do not presuppose the\ngeneral veracity of the C&D Rule. The premises contributing to\nthe conclusion of an all-perfect God remain vulnerable to hyperbolic\ndoubt. Throughout this stage of the inquiry, none of the\nmeditator\u2019s judgments based in clear and distinct perception\nconstitutes perfect knowledge. It is the unboundedness of hyperbolic\ndoubt that underwrites the No Atheistic Perfect Knowledge Thesis.\n\nA central feature of this interpretation is worth repeating. It\nis natural for critics to ask why the arguments of Arc 1 are\naccepted by the meditator if, indeed, Evil Genius Doubt\nremains in play. The answer lies in the indirect manner\nin which the doubt undermines clear and distinct perception\n (Section 4.3).\nWhile clearly and distinctly attending to a proposition,\nthe mind cannot but assent: \u201cmy nature is such that\nso long as I perceive something very clearly and distinctly I\ncannot but believe it to be true.\u201d Therefore, while\nthe meditator attends to the steps of the Third Meditation arguments \nfor God, he cannot but accept them. However, the meditator does not \n(yet) have perfect knowledge of those premises, nor of their \nconclusions. How, then, do those matters finally rise to the status\nof perfect knowledge? We return to this issue, below. At present,\nthe focus is on the issue of circularity.\n\nThough bounded and unbounded doubt interpretations can both avoid \nvicious circularity, each confronts further difficulties \u2013\nboth textual and philosophical. Avoiding the charge of vicious \ncircularity marks the beginning of the interpreter\u2019s work,\nnot the end. Bounded doubt interpreters must explain why, in the \nfirst place, the Evil Genius Doubt\u2019s potency does\nnot extend to propositions in the special class. Unbounded doubt \ninterpreters must explain why, in the final analysis,\nthe Evil Genius Doubt eventually loses it undermining potency. \nLet\u2019s consider each of these further problems.\n\nGranting a bounded doubt interpretation, why \u2013 in the first\nplace \u2013 does the Evil Genius Doubt\u2019s potency not extend\nto propositions in the special class? How is it that the doubt\ndoes undermine the proposition \u201cthat two and three\nadded together make five,\u201d but not the proposition\n\u201cthat there must be at least as much [reality] in the efficient\nand total cause as in the effect of that cause\u201d? The first\nproposition is included in the list of examples that are\nundermined by the Evil Genius Doubt (see the fourth paragraph of the\nThird Meditation). The second proposition is a premise in a Third\nMeditation argument for God \u2013 a proposition immune to doubt,\naccording to bounded doubt interpretations. What is supposed to be\nthe relevant difference between these propositions? Given the indirect\nmanner in which Evil Genius Doubt operates, there seems no clear\nexplanation of why the doubt succeeds in undermining the first\nproposition but is somehow resisted by the second. Further awkward for\nthis interpretation is that the cogito is included in the\nlist of examples that that same fourth paragraph passage implies is\nvulnerable to doubt.\n\nGranting an unbounded doubt interpretation, why \u2013 in the final\nanalysis \u2013 does the Evil Genius Doubt eventually lose its\nundermining potency? Putting the point ironically: Why doesn\u2019t\nthe Evil Genius Doubt undermine the very arguments intended to refute\nthe Evil Genius Doubt, as soon as the mind is no longer attending to\nthose premises? Consider Descartes\u2019 own explanation of how\nhyperbolic doubt undermines the conclusions of arguments once their\npremises are no longer in the mind\u2019s view:\n\nThere are other truths which are perceived very clearly by our\nintellect so long as we attend to the arguments on which our knowledge\nof them depends; and we are therefore incapable of doubting them\nduring this time. But we may forget the arguments in question and\nlater remember simply the conclusions which were deduced from them.\nThe question will now arise as to whether we possess the same firm and\nimmutable conviction concerning these conclusions, when we simply\nrecollect that they were previously deduced from quite evident\nprinciples (our ability to call them \u2018conclusions\u2019\npresupposes such a recollection). (Replies 2, AT 7:146, CSM 2:104)\n\n\nSo, when we\u2019re no longer clearly and distinctly perceiving the\nsteps of an argument, we do not \u201cpossess the same firm and\nimmutable conviction\u201d of its conclusion. But precisely such\nmoments are when hyperbolic doubt does its undermining work. This\nmeans that upon diverting attention from the premises of Arcs 1 and\n2, it would then be possible to run the Evil Genius Doubt on their conclusions. It would thus seem that unbounded doubt interpretations \nleave us in a Sisyphus-like predicament. According to the myth, each \ntime Sisyphus pushes his boulder near to the top of the hill, the \nboulder slips away, rolling to the very bottom, and the whole process \nmust start all over. By carefully constructing the arguments of Arcs\n1 and 2, the meditator gains anti-sceptical momentum, pushing his \nproject near to the goal of perfect knowledge. But each time, once\nhis attention is diverted from the steps of the arguments, he finds\nhimself back at the bottom of the hill, wondering about the\ncredibility of those proofs that had seemed so evident: that is\n(as Descartes states the comparable problem, above), the question\nnow arises \u201cas to whether we possess the same firm and\nimmutable conviction concerning these conclusions, when we simply\nrecollect that they were previously deduced from quite evident\nprinciples.\u201d As Michael Ayers writes:\n\nDescartes\u2019s enterprise might well look worthless. For even\nif it were granted that his argument is both valid and simple enough\nto be grasped intuitively, as soon as it is no longer so grasped it \nwould seem to fall open to the very same doubt as it refutes. What\nis the value of such a momentary triumph over scepticism? (1998,\n1013)\n\n\nLet\u2019s turn to an account that purports to solve this problem\narising with unbounded doubt interpretations.\n\n(For examples of bounded doubt interpretations, see Broughton 2002, \nDoney 1955, Della Rocca 2005, Kenny 1968, Morris 1973,\nRickless 2005, and Wilson 1978. For examples of unbounded doubt \ninterpretations, see Carriero 2009, Curley 1978 and 1993, DeRose \n1992, Loeb 1992, Newman 2012, Newman & Nelson 1999, Sosa \n1997a and 1997b, and Van Cleve 1979.)\n6.2 Self-Evident God Interpretation\n\nAgain, the hard question for unbounded doubt interpretations: Why,\nin the final analysis, does the Evil Genius Doubt eventually lose it\nundermining potency? One recent unbounded doubt interpretation (Newman\n& Nelson 1999) offers a solution, including an explanation of why\nDescartes waits until the end of the Fifth Meditation to claim final\nvictory over the sceptical problem. Here is a sketch of the\naccount.\n\nDescartes claims that his final solution to the sceptical problem\nmakes it \u201cimpossible for us ever to have any reason for\ndoubting what we are convinced of.\u201d Yet how is this \nimpossibility supposed to be achieved? We have seen\nthat the sticking point in the account is indirect doubt. \nDescartes rejects that we could overcome the problem via\nuninterrupted clear and distinct perception: \u201cmy nature is\nalso such that I cannot fix my mental vision continually on the\nsame thing, so as to keep perceiving it clearly; and often the\nmemory of a previously made judgement may come back, when I am\nno longer attending to the arguments which led me to make it.\u201d\nAt such moments of inattention, an indirect doubt remains possible\nso long as we can make sense of the evil genius scenario, or any\nother scenario wherein we have a defective cognitive nature. It\nthus seems that a final solution to the problem would need (somehow)\nto make it no longer possible to make sense of the relevant sceptical \nscenarios. Indeed, the proposed interpretation has it the sceptical \nscenarios become self-evidently incoherent. We come to have an\nutterly basic apprehension that we\u2019re the creation of an\nall-perfect creator who would not allow us to be deceived about\nwhat we clearly and distinctly perceive.\n\nThe needed apprehension of God would have to be self-evident. \nFor suppose my apprehension is grounded in a demonstration. In that \ncase, it\u2019s possible to think of the conclusion of that \ndemonstration without also thinking of the premises; and on such \noccasions, my confidence in the demonstration is vulnerable to an \nindirect doubt. Thus, the needed apprehension of God is a self-evident, \nclear and distinct conception that renders \u2013 as literally \nunthinkable \u2013 the very sceptical scenarios that underwrite \nindirect doubt.\n\nA useful analogy lies in the doubt-resisting character of the\ncogito. If I attempt a direct doubt of own my\nexistence, the effort is self-stultifying; I immediately apprehend\nthat I must exist, in order to attempt the doubt. What Descartes\nneeds is a similarly strong and immediate doubt-resisting outcome\nin connection with the very attempt at running an indirect \ndoubt. That is, on occasions of trying to undermine clearly and \ndistinctly perceived matters \u2013 e.g., by doubting God\u2019s \nexistence, or benevolence, or the like \u2013 the very effort at\ndoubt would be immediately thwarted.\n\nMultiple texts suggest that this is the account Descartes intends,\nand that the Fifth Meditation is the locus of the meditator\u2019s\ndiscovery of an enhanced, self-evident apprehension of God. The\nFifth Meditation introduces various themes about innate truths, \nincluding the positive epistemic effects of repeated meditation:\ntruths initially noticed only by means of inference might eventually \ncome to be apprehended self-evidently. In the build-up to the\npassage claiming that the Evil Genius Doubt is finally and fully \novercome, Descartes writes:\n\nSome of the things I clearly and distinctly perceive are obvious to\neveryone, while others are discovered only by those who look more\nclosely and investigate more carefully; but once they have been\ndiscovered, the latter are judged to be just as certain as the former.\nIn the case of a right-angled triangle, for example, the fact that the\nsquare on the hypotenuse is equal to the square on the other two sides\nis not so readily apparent as the fact that the hypotenuse subtends\nthe largest angle; but once one has seen it, one believes it just as\nstrongly. But as regards God, if I were not overwhelmed by\npreconceived opinions, and if the images of things perceived by the\nsenses did not besiege my thought on every side, I would certainly\nacknowledge him sooner and more easily than anything else. For what is\nmore self-evident [ex se est apertius] than the fact that the\nsupreme being exists, or that God, to whose essence alone existence\nbelongs, exists?\nAlthough it needed close attention for me to\nperceive this, I am now just as certain of it as I am of everything\nelse which appears most certain. And what is more, I see that the\ncertainty of all other things depends on this, so that without it\nnothing can ever be perfectly known. (AT 7:69, CSM 2:47f)\n\n\nDescartes reiterates the theme in the Second Replies:\n\nI ask my readers to spend a great deal of time and effort on\ncontemplating the nature of the supremely perfect being. Above all\nthey should reflect on the fact that the ideas of all other natures\ncontain possible existence, whereas the idea of God contains not only\npossible but wholly necessary existence. This alone, without a formal\nargument, will make them realize that God exists; and this will\neventually be just as self-evident [per se notum] to them as\nthe fact that the number two is even or that three is odd, and so on.\nFor there are certain truths which some people find self-evident,\nwhile others come to understand them only by means of a formal\nargument. (AT 7:163f, CSM 2:115)\n\n\nThese passages convey that one\u2019s apprehension of God eventually\nupgrades from being inferential, to being transparently self-evident.\nGranting that the meditator has achieved an apprehension of God of\nthis kind, it plausibly explains why Descartes would think he\u2019s\nachieved a final solution to the sceptical problem. Given his newfound\nepistemic standing, the meditator would be unable to make coherent\nsense of the Evil Genius Doubt. His clear and distinct perceptions\nwould be fully indubitable, thereby counting as perfect knowledge.\n\nThe interpretation helps explain two passages wherein Descartes\npurports to be detailing the final solution to the sceptical problem.\nIn both passages, he can seem simply to be asserting that\nsceptical doubts are impossible, as if having forgotten the\nindirect manner in which his own hyperbolic doubt operates.\nBut if we take Descartes to be assuming that the apprehension of God\nhas become utterly self-evident, both passages make more sense. The\none passage arises in the Second Replies, in the context of rebutting\nan objection to the effect that, in the final analysis, it remains\npossible to doubt clear and distinct perception. Descartes replies\nthat the objector is \u201cstill stuck fast\u201d in doubts\n\u201cput forward in the First Meditation,\u201d but \u201cvery\ncarefully removed in the succeeding Meditations,\u201d adding:\n\n[O]nce we have become aware that God exists it is necessary for us to\nimagine that he is a deceiver if we wish to cast doubt on what we\nclearly and distinctly perceive. And since it is impossible to\nimagine that he is a deceiver, whatever we clearly and distinctly\nperceive must be completely accepted as true and certain. (AT 7:144,\nCSM 2:103; italics added)\n\n\nThe other passage arises in the Fifth Meditation, in the concluding\nsummary explanation of how the sceptical problem is finally overcome.\nImportantly, on the present interpretation, is the context in which\nthe summary explanation occurs: namely, on the heels of revealing the\nnewly discovered thesis, that nothing \u201cis more self-evident than\nthe fact that the supreme being exists.\u201d In that context,\nDescartes explains that a final solution to the sceptical problem has\nbeen achieved.\n\nNow, however, I have perceived that God exists, and at the same time I\nhave understood that everything else depends on him, and that he is no\ndeceiver; and I have drawn the conclusion that everything which I\nclearly and distinctly perceive is of necessity true. Accordingly,\neven if I am no longer attending to the arguments which led me to\njudge that this is true, as long as I remember that I clearly and\ndistinctly perceived it, there are no counter-arguments which can be\nadduced to make me doubt it, but on the contrary I have true and\ncertain knowledge of it. And I have knowledge not just of this matter,\nbut of all matters which I remember ever having demonstrated, in\ngeometry and so on. For what objections can now be raised? That the\nway I am made makes me prone to frequent error? But I now know that I\nam incapable of error in those cases where my understanding is\ntransparently clear. Or can it be objected that I have in the past\nregarded as true and certain many things which I afterwards recognized\nto be false? But none of these were things which I clearly and\ndistinctly perceived: I was ignorant of this rule for establishing the\ntruth, and believed these things for other reasons which I later\ndiscovered to be less reliable. So what is left to say? (AT 7:70, CSM\n2:48f)\n\n\nAbsent a self-evident apprehension of God, the two passages appear\ninexplicable, with Descartes seeming to misunderstand the sceptical\nimplications of his own Evil Genius Doubt. But on the self-evident God\ninterpretation, both passages read as a summary of the anti-sceptical\neffects of it being impossible to conceive of God as a deceiver. As\nDescartes writes to Voetius, the very thought of God as a deceiver\n\u201cimplies a conceptual contradiction \u2013 that is, it cannot\nbe conceived\u201d (May 1643 letter, AT 8b:60, CSMK 222). The\ninterpretation also makes sense of why the final victory over\nscepticism is announced not at the end of the Fourth Meditation, but\nat the end the Fifth \u2013 i.e., after the enhanced, self-evident \napprehension of God is supposed to have been achieved.\n\n(For further discussion see Newman & Nelson 1999, Nolan 2005,\nand Nolan &and Nelson 2006.)\n6.3 Another Cartesian Circle?\n\nMichael Della Rocca has recently argued that a further circle arises\nfrom considerations in the Fourth Meditation \u2013 a problem he\nsuspects is \u201cmore difficult to get out of than the traditional\nproblem of circularity\u201d (2011, 98). To help clarify this further\ncircle, Della Rocca focuses on a twofold question:\n\nWhy, for Descartes, should we not assent to ideas that are not clear\nand distinct and why is there no such obligation not to assent to\nclear and distinct ideas? The reason Descartes offers seems to be that\nwe should not assent to ideas that are not clear and distinct because\nthey, unlike clear and distinct ideas, are not guaranteed to be true.\n(2011, 96)\n\n\nAs Della Rocca understands the broader Fourth Meditation argument, the\nclaim that we should assent only to what we clearly and distinctly\nperceive is an essential step in the ongoing argument to establish the\ndivine guarantee of clear and distinct perception. Since this step\npresupposes the eventual conclusion, that conclusion is based on\ncircular reasoning:\n\nOne of the premises needed for arguing that clear and distinct ideas\nare true is, as we have seen, that we should assent only to clear and\ndistinct ideas. This claim, in turn, requires argument, and the\nargument for it seems to be based on the claim that clear and distinct\nideas are guaranteed to be true. So, one of the premises of the\nargument for the claim that clear and distinct ideas are true is that\nclear and distinct ideas are guaranteed to be true. Here, the\nconclusion \u2013 indeed, a strengthened version of the conclusion\n\u2013 is itself a premise in the argument. (2011, 98)\n\n\nPerhaps we can avoid this alleged circle. The linchpin of Della\nRocca\u2019s charge of circularity is his contention that\n\u201cDescartes\u2019s reason for saying that we should assent only\nto clear and distinct ideas is that such ideas are guaranteed to be\ntrue and ideas that are not clear and distinct are not guaranteed to\nbe true\u201d (2011, 97). Though Descartes can be read in this way,\nthe texts support the following alternative understanding of the\nbroader argumentative narrative. In the First Meditation, the\nmeditator initially resolves that he should withhold assent to\nanything which is \u201cnot completely certain and indubitable\u201d\n(AT 7:18, CSM 2:12). Early in the Third Meditation, having reflected\non the epistemic impressiveness of the cogito, the meditator\ndiscovers that all, but only, clear and distinct\nperceptions are utterly assent-compelling. As a practical consequence,\nhis initial resolve effectively implies that he should assent only to\nclear and distinct perceptions \u2013 not because of presupposing the\nconclusion of the eventual proof of the C&D Rule, but because\nthese are the only perceptions to which he can\u2019t but\nassent. This provides a practical answer to Della Rocca\u2019s\nquestion, concerning why we should \u201cnot assent to ideas that are\nnot clear and distinct and why is there no such obligation not to\nassent to clear and distinct ideas.\u201d It is in the Fourth\nMeditation that the meditator purports to demonstrate the divine\nguarantee of the C&D Rule. However, no step of that demonstration\npresupposes that clear and distinct perceptions have already been\nestablished as true; i.e., the conclusion of the demonstration is not,\nas Della Rocca contends, \u201cbased on the claim that clear and\ndistinct ideas are guaranteed to be true.\u201d Rather (as we saw in\n Section 5.3),\n the conclusion purports to be based on an analysis of the respective\ncontributions of the intellect and the will, to judgment formation.\nSummarizing the key steps:\n\nSo what then is the source of my mistakes? It must be simply this: the\nscope of the will is wider than that of the intellect; but instead of\nrestricting it within the same limits, I extend its use to matters\nwhich I do not understand. (AT 7:58, CSM 2:40)\n\n\nGranted, the meditator needs each of the demonstrative steps to be\nclearly and distinctly perceived. However, he needs this not because\nof presupposing the conclusion to be proved, but in order to be in\ncompliance with his own initial resolve, stated in the First\nMeditation \u2013 to withhold assent to anything which is\n\u201cnot completely certain and indubitable.\u201d\n\nCentral to the above account avoiding Della Rocca\u2019s circle is\n(among other claims) the thesis that clear and distinct perceptions\nare assent-compelling \u2013 i.e., as Descartes writes, that\n\u201cthe nature of my mind is such that I cannot but assent to these\nthings, at least so long as I clearly perceive them.\u201d It it thus\nworth noting that Della Rocca wavers on whether Descartes holds this\nthesis: he interprets a remark in Descartes\u2019 correspondence (9\nFeb 1645, AT 4:173, CSMK 245) to suggest \u201cthat we can withhold\nassent from even a current clear and distinct perception\u201d (2006,\n155).\n6.4 Is Truth a Condition of Perfect Knowledge?\n\nWe noted in\n Section 1.1\n that Descartes\u2019 clearest statements appear to indicate a\njustified belief analysis of perfect knowledge. Consider\nagain the relevant Second Replies passage:\n\nHence you see that once we have become aware that\nGod exists it is necessary for us to imagine that he is a deceiver if\nwe wish to cast doubt on what we clearly and distinctly perceive. And\nsince it is impossible to imagine that he is a deceiver, whatever we\nclearly and distinctly perceive must be completely accepted as true\nand certain.\nBut since I see that you are still stuck fast in\nthe doubts which I put forward in the First Meditation, and which I\nthought I had very carefully removed in the succeeding Meditations, I\nshall now expound for a second time the basis on which it seems to me\nthat all human certainty can be founded.\nFirst of all, as soon as we think that we\ncorrectly perceive something, we are spontaneously convinced that it\nis true. Now if this conviction is so firm that it is impossible for\nus ever to have any reason for doubting what we are convinced of, then\nthere are no further questions for us to ask: we have everything that\nwe could reasonably want. What is it to us that someone may make out\nthat the perception whose truth we are so firmly convinced of may\nappear false to God or an angel, so that it is, absolutely speaking,\nfalse? Why should this alleged \u201cabsolute falsity\u201d bother\nus, since we neither believe in it nor have even the smallest\nsuspicion of it? For the supposition which we are making here is of a\nconviction so firm that it is quite incapable of being destroyed; and\nsuch a conviction is clearly the same as the most perfect certainty.\n(AT 7:144f, CSM 2:103)\n\n\nThe last part of the passage emphasizes two conditions: a belief\ncondition, expressed in terms of conviction, and a\njustification condition, expressed in terms of indubitability\nor unshakability \u2013 \u201cconviction based on a reason so strong\nthat it can never be shaken by any stronger reason.\u201d\nConspicuously missing is any further condition stipulating that\nthe conviction must be true. The passage does clarify,\nof anything that would count as perfect knowledge, that it is\n\u201ccompletely accepted as true\u201d; that we are\n\u201cconvinced that it is true,\u201d indeed, that we are\n\u201cfirmly convinced.\u201d But these remarks speak to the\nbelief condition, not to an expressed truth condition. \nIndeed, the passage is plausibly read even more strongly: i.e.,\nnot merely as omitting mention of a truth condition, but as\nallowing for some broad possibility that what we regard\nas indubitable truths are, \u201cabsolutely speaking, \nfalse.\u201d\n\nWhy, then, is Descartes dismissive of the stated objection, indicating\nthat it shouldn\u2019t \u201cbother\u201d us? On one plausible \nreading of the passage, Descartes is assuming that the \npossibility in question is simply a further iteration of\nEvil Genius Doubt \u2013 \u201cI see that you are still stuck fast\nin the doubts which I put forward in the First Meditation.\u201d \nWhether a deceiving God is really possible, it\u2019s \nsomething Descartes has argued to be unimaginable for perfect\nknowers, i.e., for successful graduates of the Meditations \n\u2013 \u201cit is impossible to imagine that he [God] is a \ndeceiver.\u201d On a plausible reading, therefore, Descartes is \ndismissive of the objection not on metaphysical grounds of absolute \nimpossibility, but on epistemic grounds of indubitability:\nthe \u201calleged \u2018absolute falsity\u2019,\u201d noted in\nthe objection, should in no way \u201cbother us\u201d because our \nconviction is \u201cso firm that it is quite incapable of being \ndestroyed.\u201d\n\nWhy does Descartes not add a truth condition, thereby ensuring that\nbeliefs counting as perfect knowledge are true? In an \ninfluential 1970 book, Harry Frankfurt offers a provocative answer.\nHe argues that Descartes\u2019 goal, truth-wise, is to establish\nthe consistency of our beliefs, but not their correspondence with\nan external reality. Writes Frankfurt:\n\nThe point of Descartes\u2019s validation of reason is that if reason\nis properly employed \u2013 that is, if we give assent only to what\nwe clearly and distinctly perceive \u2013 we are not led to doubt\nthat reason is reliable. \u2026 The crux of Descartes\u2019s\nvalidation of reason is not so much the discovery that a benign deity\nexists, but that reason leads to the conclusion that such a deity\nexists. (1970, 176)\n\n\nFrankfurt thinks that Descartes\u2019 novel plan involves arguing\nthat our best rational efforts show that our best rational efforts are\nlogically consistent: it is \u201can attempt to show that there are\nno good reasons for believing that reason is unreliable \u2013 that\nthe mistrust of reason is not supported by reason and that it is\naccordingly irrational\u201d (1970, 175). Frankfurt adds that\n\u201cthe conception of truth involved in [Descartes\u2019] question\nabout the truth of what is clearly and distinctly perceived is, in\nother words, a conception of coherence rather than of\ncorrespondence\u201d (1970, 170).\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s coherentist interpretation is at odds with a number\nof textual and doctrinal considerations. Descartes writes to Mersenne\nthat \u201cthe word \u2018truth\u2019, in the strict sense, denotes\nthe conformity of thought with its object\u201d (16 Oct 1639, AT\n2:597, CSMK 139). The suggestion here is of some version of a\ncorrespondence theory. Also, on the most straightforward reading of\nthe epistemic moves in the Meditations, Descartes is\npresupposing that at least some truths involve extramental\nmetaphysical relations. Consider that Evil Genius Doubt is,\nfundamentally, a worry not about whether our various clear and\ndistinct judgments cohere, but about whether they accurately\nrepresent an extramental reality \u2013 i.e., a doubt about\n\u201cwhether things do in reality correspond to our perception of\nthem\u201d (Replies 4, AT 7:226, CSM 2:159). Interestingly, Frankfurt\nhimself came to renounce the interpretation:\n\nI now think, however, that it was a mistake on my part to suggest that\nDescartes entertained a coherence conception of truth. The fact is\nthat there is no textual evidence to support that suggestion; on the\ncontrary, whenever Descartes gives an explicit account of truth he\nexplains it unequivocally as correspondence with reality. (1978, 36f)\n\n\nHow then should we interpret the Second Replies passage, and how\nshould we understand the absence of a truth condition? I suggest that\nthe lack of a truth condition need not reflect an indifference about\ntruth, as opposed to a view about how a concern for truth is properly\nexpressed in an account of knowledge. We can understand Descartes as\nwanting a fully internalist account whereby all\nconditions of knowledge are accessible to the would-be knower. Putting\nthe point another way, if the question of whether the\nconditions of knowledge had been met were answerable only by\n\u201cGod or an angel,\u201d it would impose an unacceptably\nexternalist element on the theory. On a justified\nbelief rendering, his account of perfect knowledge is\nfully internalist; yet, with the addition of a truth condition, it is\nnot \u2013 at least, not given a correspondence theory of\ntruth, in the context of metaphysical realism. Importantly, then, in\nattributing to Descartes a justified belief account, we need not\nthereby attribute to him an indifference concerning truth.\nRather, we can attribute to him the view that the way properly to\nexpress one\u2019s concern for truth is by enforcing high\njustificatory standards. Again, from that same passage:\n\nNow if this conviction is so firm that it is impossible for us ever to\nhave any reason for doubting what we are convinced of, then there are\nno further questions for us to ask: we have everything that we could\nreasonably want.\n\n\nOne possible objection to a justified belief account is expressed by\nLennon, who worries that on such accounts the desired cognitive state\n(indubitability) \u201ccould as well be achieved by a pill\u201d;\nadding that \u201cDescartes would not be satisfied with such a pill\nbecause his aim is not just to arrive at certainty, but truth, which\nhe cannot help but think he has achieved\u201d (2008, 167). (Cf.\nHatfield 2006, 135, who expresses a related objection.)\n\nGranted, if the pill simply prevented me from apprehending any reasons\nfor doubting my beliefs, we\u2019d be loath to regard such beliefs as\nknowledge. Descartes himself makes a related point in connection with\nan atheist geometer who happens never to doubt his beliefs, simply\nbecause the Evil Genius Doubt never occurs to him:\n\n[A]lthough this doubt may not occur to him, it can still crop up if\nsomeone else raises the point or if he looks into the matter himself.\nSo he will never be free of this doubt until he acknowledges that God\nexists. (Replies 2, AT 7:141, CSM 2:101)\n\n\nPresumably, Descartes\u2019 point holds whether the doubt simply\nnever occurs to him, or is instead prevented from occurring by a\npill. Note further that the spirit of the objection presupposes that \nthe achieved indubitability is merely psychological, in that \nthe person simply runs up against an inexplicable inability\nto doubt. Yet we have seen clear texts which have Descartes \ncharacterizing the desired states of clarity and distinctness not \nmerely psychologically, but, further, in epistemic terms implying a \nsort of cognitive luminance, or rational insight.\nHe uses light metaphors including the association of clarity and \ndistinctness with the natural light.  The meditator\u2019s \nability to ward off the evil demon \u2013 during occurrent clarity\nand distinctness \u2013 is described in terms of perceiving \n\u201cutterly clearly with [the] mind\u2019s eye\u201d; and of\nbeing \u201cconvinced\u201d of all matters the denial of which\nleads one to \u201csee a manifest contradiction\u201d (Med. 3,\nAT 7:36, CSM 2:25). In Descartes\u2019 view, our inability to doubt \nthe matters we clearly and distinctly perceive is not simply a causal \nresult, but also a rational result of what such perception enables\nus to understand. Were there a pill that would induce both the\ncausal and the rational outcomes that Descartes associates with\nperfect knowledge, then, arguably, he would endorse taking the pill.  \nFor we would then \u201chave everything that we could reasonably \nwant.\u201d\n\nAnother possible objection is that Descartes\u2019 high justificatory\nstandards generate a de facto truth condition: because having\nCartesian certainty entails that one\u2019s beliefs are\ntrue, truth is a necessary condition of knowledge. But this objection\nmisses a key point. As suggested in the Second Replies passage,\nCartesian certainty \u2013 understood in terms of\nindubitability \u2013 does not, strictly speaking, rule out\nthe broad possibility that we are in error. The notions of\nindubitability and truth are different: that\n\u201cp is indubitable\u201d entails not that\n\u201cp is true,\u201d but that \u201cthere can be no\nreasons for doubting p.\u201d Descartes\u2019 final\nsolution to the Evil Genius Doubt entails not that an evil genius\ncannot be, but that it cannot be coherently\nconceived. And that it cannot be coherently conceived, thinks\nDescartes, gives us \u201ceverything that we could reasonably\nwant\u201d \u2013 not because such coherence is the goal, but\nbecause of what it establishes, truth-wise.\n\n(For further discussion of the role of truth in perfect knowledge, see\nFrankfurt 1970 and 1978, Hatfield 2006, Lennon 2008, Loeb\n1992, and Newman & Nelson 1999.)\n7. Proving an External Material World\n\nThe opening line of the Sixth Meditation makes clear its principal\nobjective: \u201cIt remains for me to examine whether material things\nexist\u201d (AT 7:71, CSM 2:50). At this juncture, the meditator\nperfectly knows of his own existence and of God\u2019s. It follows\nthat there\u2019s an external world with at least one object, namely,\nGod. However, the existence of an external material world\nremains in doubt. Establishing the existence of material bodies is not\na straightforward matter of perceiving them, because, in\nDescartes\u2019 view, \u201cbodies are not strictly perceived by the\nsenses\u201d (see\n Section 9.1).\n\nIn his eventual argument, Descartes\u2019 strategy for proving an\nexternal material world has two main parts: first, he argues for the\nexternality of the causes of sensation; second, he argues for\nthe materiality of these external causes. (Calling the ideas\nin question \u201csensations\u201d can seem circular, if one\nconceives of sensations as having a physiological component. But note\nthat for Descartes, \u201cwhat is called \u2018having a sensory\nperception\u2019,\u201d strictly encompasses only a mental aspect\nMed. 2, AT 7:29, CSM 2:19). From these two steps, it follows that there\nexists an external material world. Let\u2019s consider each phase of\nthe argument.\n7.1 Case for the Externality\nof the Causes of Sensation\n\nDescartes builds on a familiar line of argument in the history of\nphilosophy, itself appealing to the involuntariness of sensations.\nThe familiar argument is first articulated in the Third Meditation.\nSpeaking of his apparently adventitious ideas (sensations), the\nmeditator remarks:\n\nBut the chief question at this point concerns the ideas which I take\nto be derived from things existing outside me \u2026 I know by\nexperience that these ideas do not depend on my will, and hence that\nthey do not depend simply on me. Frequently I notice them even when I\ndo not want to: now, for example, I feel the heat whether I want to or\nnot, and this is why I think that this sensation or idea of heat comes\nto me from something other than myself, namely the heat of the fire by\nwhich I am sitting. (AT 7:38, CSM 2:26)\n\n\nThough some such involuntariness argument has convinced many\nphilosophers, the inference does not hold up to methodical doubt, as\nthe meditator explains:\n\nThen again, although these [apparently adventitious] ideas do not\ndepend on my will, it does not follow that they must come from things\nlocated outside me. Just as the impulses which I was speaking of a\nmoment ago seem opposed to my will even though they are within me, so\nthere may be some other faculty [of my mind] not yet fully known to\nme, which produces these ideas without any assistance from external\nthings; this is, after all, just how I have always thought ideas are\nproduced in me when I am dreaming. (Med. 3, AT 7:39, CSM 2:27)\n\n\nWe first examined this passage in regard to the Always Dreaming Doubt.\nThat sceptical hypothesis raises the problem of the existence of\nexternal things. For all I know, my \u201cwaking\u201d experiences \nare produced not by external things, but by processes similar to those\nproducing my dreams. This sceptical possibility explains why the\nfamiliar involuntariness argument fails: the inference presupposes\nexactly what is at issue \u2013 namely, whether involuntarily\nreceived sensory ideas are produced by external things, rather than\nby a subconscious faculty of my mind.\n\nMany philosophers have assumed that we lack the epistemic resources to\nsolve this sceptical problem. For example, Hume writes:\n\nBy what argument can it be proved, that the perceptions of the mind\nmust be caused by external objects \u2026 and could not arise either\nfrom the energy of the mind itself \u2026 or from some other cause\nstill more unknown to us? It is acknowledged, that, in fact, many of\nthese perceptions arise not from anything external, as in dreams,\nmadness, and other diseases. \u2026 It is a question of fact,\nwhether the perceptions of the senses be produced by external objects\n\u2026 But here experience is, and must be entirely silent.\n(Enquiry Sec. 12)\n\n\nInterestingly, Descartes would agree that experiential\nresources cannot solve the problem. By the Sixth Meditation, however,\nDescartes purports to have the innate resources he needs to\nsolve it \u2013 notably, innate ideas of mind and body. Among the\nmetaphysical theses he develops is that mind and body have wholly\ndistinct essences: the essence of thinking substance is pure thought;\nthe essence of body is pure extension. In a remarkable maneuver,\nDescartes invokes this distinction to refute the sceptical worry that\nsensations are produced by a subconscious faculty of the mind:\n\u201cnothing can be in me, that is to say, in my mind, of which I am\nnot aware,\u201d and this \u201cfollows from the fact that the soul\nis distinct from the body and that its essence is to think\u201d (13\nDec 1640 letter to Mersenne, AT 3:273, CSMK 165f). This result allows\nDescartes to supplement the involuntariness argument, thereby\nstrengthening the inference. For from the additional premise that\nnothing can be in my mind of which I am unaware, it follows\nthat if sensations were being produced by some activity in my mind,\nI\u2019d be aware of that activity on the occasion of its operation.\nSince I\u2019m not thus aware, it follows that the sensation\nI\u2019m having is produced by a cause external to my mind. As\nDescartes writes, this cause\n\n\u2026 cannot be in me, since clearly it presupposes no intellectual\nact [of awareness] on my part, and the ideas in question are produced\nwithout my cooperation and often even against my will. So the only\nalternative is that it is in another substance distinct from me\n\u2026 (Med. 6, AT 7:79, CSM 2:55)\n\n\nIt follows that my sensations are caused by external world objects\n\u2013 i.e., objects external to my mind. It remains to be shown that\nthese external causes are material objects.\n7.2 Case for the Materiality\nof the Causes of Sensation\n\nOn Descartes\u2019 analysis, there are three possible options for the\nkind of external thing causing sensations:\n\nGod\nMaterial/corporeal substance\nSome other created substance\n\n\nThat is, the cause is either infinite substance (God), or finite\nsubstance; and if finite, then either corporeal, or something else.\nDescartes thinks he eliminates options (a) and (c) by appeal to God\nbeing no deceiver:\n\nBut since God is not a deceiver, it is quite clear that he does not\ntransmit the ideas to me either directly from himself, or indirectly,\nvia some creature [other than corporeal substance] \u2026 For God\nhas given me no faculty at all for recognizing any such\nsource for these ideas; on the contrary, he has given me a great\npropensity to believe that they are produced by corporeal things.\nIt follows that corporeal things exist. (Med. 6, AT 7:79f, CSM 2:55;\nitalics added)\n\n\nThis is a problematic passage. The \u201cgreat propensity\u201d\nhere cited is not the irresistible compulsion of clear and distinct\nperception. (If it were, the conclusion that sensation is caused by\nmaterial objects would follow straightaway from this clear and\ndistinct perception, via the C&D Rule.) But unless each step of\nthe argument is clearly and distinctly perceived, Descartes should not\nbe making the argument. Adding to the difficulties of the passage, he\nexpressly cites the conclusion as following from the fact that\n\u201cGod is not a deceiver,\u201d implying that he thinks this\ninference is supported by a divine guarantee.\n\nOn one kind of interpretation, Descartes relaxes his epistemic\nstandards in the Sixth Meditation (cf. Schmitt 1986, 493f). He no\nlonger insists on perfect knowledge, now settling for probabilistic\narguments. Though no decisive texts support the interpretation, it\ndoes find some support. For instance, in the Synopsis to the\nMeditations, Descartes writes of his Sixth Meditation\narguments:\n\nThe great benefit of these arguments is not, in my view, that they\nprove what they establish \u2026 The point is that in considering\nthese arguments we come to realize that they are not as solid or as\ntransparent as the arguments which lead us to knowledge of our own\nminds and of God \u2026 (AT 7:15f, CSM 2:11)\n\n\nThe remark can be read as a concession that the Sixth Meditation\narguments are weaker than the earlier arguments about minds and God\n\u2013 that these later arguments do not \u201cprove what they\nestablish.\u201d Of course, one need not read the remark this way.\nAnd other texts are unfavorable to this interpretation. For example,\nin the opening paragraphs of the Sixth Meditation, Descartes considers\na probabilistic argument for the existence of external bodies. Though\nhe accepts the proposed account as offering the best explanation, he\nnonetheless dismisses it for the express reason that it grounds\n\u201conly a probability\u201d \u2013 it does not provide the\n\u201cbasis for a necessary inference that some body exists\u201d\n(AT 7:73, CSM 2:51). This is a puzzling dismissal, assuming Descartes\nhas relaxed his standards to probable inference.\n\nThe relaxed standards interpretation falls short for another reason.\nIt leaves unexplained why Descartes cites a divine guarantee for the\nconclusion that sensations are caused by material objects.\n\nOn another kind of interpretation, the troubling passage appealing to\na \u201cgreat propensity\u201d does not mark a relaxing of epistemic\nstandards. Instead, Descartes is extending the implications of his\ndiscussion of theodicy in the Fourth Meditation to encompass further\ncases of natural belief \u2013 such beliefs deriving from our\nGod-given cognitive nature. It was noted above\n (Section 5.2)\n that Descartes thinks the divine guarantee of the C&D Rule\nfollows, in part, from the fact that God wouldn\u2019t allow us to be\nmistaken when our assent is a natural consequence of our God-given\ncognitive nature. Suppose Descartes holds that there are further cases\nin which an all-perfect God would not allow us to be in error, in part\nbecause the beliefs in question arise naturally from our God-given\ncognitive nature. And suppose the further cases involve a\nnatural propensity to believe which cannot be\ncorrected by our cognitive faculties. Given these assumptions,\nthe resulting rule for truth would look something like the\nfollowing:\n\nI am not in error in cases in which (i) I have a natural propensity to\nbelieve, and (ii) God provided me no faculty by which to correct a\nfalse such belief.\n\n\nThis rule is more expansive than the C&D Rule, in that it\nlicenses more kinds of judgments. Clauses (i) and (ii) are tailored to\nthe problematic passage wherein, as we\u2019ve seen, Descartes\ninvokes two conditions: \u201cGod has given me no faculty at all\nfor recognizing any such source for these ideas; on the contrary,\nhe has given me a great propensity to believe that they are\nproduced by corporeal things.\u201d If this is on the right\ninterpretive track, then Descartes needs some way to justify this\nrule. Assuming a proof similar in structure to the proof of the\nC&D Rule, the justification might run as follows:\n\nThere is an all-perfect God.\nAn all-perfect God cannot allow me to be in error in cases in\nwhich (i) I have a natural propensity to believe, and (ii) God\nprovided me no faculty by which to correct a false such belief.\nTherefore, I am not in error in cases in which (i) I have a\nnatural propensity to believe, and (ii) God provided me no faculty\nby which to correct a false such belief.\n\n\nIf Descartes affirms premise 2, it explains why he thinks he\u2019s\nentitled to this more expansive rule, and without relaxing his\nepistemic standards. Indeed, a number of texts indicate that he\nholds some version of premise 2. The relevant Sixth Meditation\npassage states that from \u201cthe very fact that God is not a \ndeceiver\u201d there is a \u201cconsequent impossibility of there \nbeing any falsity in my opinions which cannot be corrected by some \nother faculty supplied by God\u201d (AT 7:80, CSM 2:55f). Another \npassage adds that we would be \u201cdoing God an injustice\u201d\nif we implied \u201cthat God had endowed us with such an imperfect \nnature that even the proper use of our powers of reasoning allowed\nus to go wrong\u201d (Prin. 3:43, AT 8a:99, CSM 1:255).\nAnd in the Second Replies, Descartes addresses case of judgments\nthat \u201ccould not be corrected by any clearer judgements or by \nmeans of any other natural faculty,\u201d adding that \u201cin\nsuch cases I simply assert that it is impossible for us to be \ndeceived\u201d (Replies 2, AT 7:143f, CSM 2:102f). These passages\nmake a strong case that something like premise 2 is in play,\nindeed implying that God\u2019s benevolent nature entails a more\nexpansive rule of truth than the C&D Rule. (As will emerge,\nDescartes looks again to call on this more expansive rule\nin his effort to prove that he is not dreaming.)\n\nEarlier, we noted another apparent problem in the Sixth Meditation\npassage wherein Descartes concludes that the external cause of\nsensation is something corporeal. One of his premises cites a\ngreat propensity to believe, yet the propensity is not\nitself the irresistible compulsion of clear and distinct perception. \nDoes not the methodic procedure of the Meditations restrict \nDescartes to using clear and distinct premises? By way of reply, \ndistinguish (a) that my sensation has an external cause, and (b)\nthat I have a great propensity to believe my sensation has\nan external cause. In context, the meditator lacks clear and distinct \nperception of (a). However, the relevant premise of the argument (as \nopposed to its conclusion) is not (a), but (b). And there is no \nprincipled reason that the meditator cannot clearly and distinctly \nperceive this premise.\n\nA final observation. It goes regularly unnoticed that the conclusion\nof Descartes\u2019 argument for the existence of an external material\nworld leaves significant scepticism in place. Granting the success of\nthe argument, my sensations are caused by an external material world.\nBut for all the argument shows \u2013 for all the broader argument of\nthe Meditations shows, up to this point \u2013 my mind might\nbe joined to a brain in a vat, rather than a full human body.\nThis isn\u2019t an oversight on Descartes\u2019 part. It\u2019s all\nhe thinks the argument can prove. For even at this late stage\nof the project, the meditator has not yet established himself to be\nawake \u2013 a line of inquiry to which we now turn.\n\n(For further discussion of Descartes\u2019 effort to prove the\nexistence of an external material world, see Carriero 2009 [146ff],\nFriedman 1997, Garber 1992, and Newman 1994.)\n8. Perfect Knowledge of Being Awake\n\nBy design, the constructive arguments of the Meditations\nunfold even though the meditator remains in doubt about being awake.\nThis of course reinforces the ongoing theme that perfect knowledge\ndoes not properly encompass judgments of external sense. (The judgment\nthat an external material world exists is not strictly a judgment of\nexternal sense \u2013 as if knowing its existence simply by sensing\nit. Rather, as we\u2019ve seen, the judgment arises from an complex\ninference about the possible causes of sensations.) In the closing\nparagraph of the Sixth Meditation, Descartes revisits the issue of\ndreaming. He claims to show how, in principle \u2013 even if not\neasily in practice \u2013 it is possible to achieve perfect knowledge\nthat one is presently awake.\n\nA casual reading of that final paragraph might suggest that Descartes\noffers a naturalistic solution to the problem (i.e., a\nnon-theistic solution), in the form of a continuity test: since\ncontinuity with past experiences holds only of waking but not\ndreaming, checking for the requisite continuity provides a test for\nascertaining that one is awake. The following remarks can be read in\nthis way:\n\nI now notice that there is a vast difference between the two\n[\u201cbeing asleep and being awake\u201d], in that dreams are never\nlinked by memory with all the other actions of life as waking\nexperiences are. \u2026 But when I distinctly see where things come\nfrom and where and when they come to me, and when I can connect my\nperceptions of them with the whole of the rest of my life without a\nbreak, then I am quite certain that when I encounter these things I am\nnot asleep but awake. (AT 7:89f, CSM 2:61f)\n\n\nThis naturalistic \u201csolution\u201d prompts two obvious\ncriticisms, both raised by Hobbes in the Third Objections. First, the\nsolution runs contrary to Descartes\u2019 No Atheistic Perfect\nKnowledge Thesis: since the continuity test (on the naturalistic\nreading of it) does not invoke God, it thus appears, as Hobbes notes,\n\u201cthat someone can know he is awake without knowledge of\nthe true God\u201d (AT 7:196, CSM 2:137). Second, it seems that one\ncould dream the requisite continuity: one could \u201cdream\nthat his dream fits in with his ideas of a long series of past\nevents,\u201d thus undermining the credibility of the continuity test\n(AT 7:195, CSM 2:137).\n\nMirroring our discussion in\n Section 7.2,\n one kind of interpretation has Descartes relaxing his epistemic\nstandards. He\u2019s aware that the naturalistic solution does not\nstand up to methodic doubt, but he\u2019s not attempting to overcome\nthe Now Dreaming Doubt with perfect knowledge. A problem for this\ninterpretation is that it doesn\u2019t square with the following\nreply Descartes makes to Hobbes\u2019 first objection: \u201can\natheist can infer that he is awake on the basis of memory of his past\nlife\u201d (via the continuity test); but \u201che cannot know that\nthis criterion is sufficient to give him the certainty that he is not\nmistaken, if he does not know that he was created by a non-deceiving\nGod\u201d (Replies 3, AT 7:196, CSM 2:137). Evidently,\nDescartes\u2019 solution is not supposed to be available to the\natheist. Taken at face value, this reply rules out a relaxed standards\ninterpretation; it indeed rules out any interpretation involving a\nnaturalistic solution to the problem of dreaming.\n\nOn closer inspection, the Sixth Meditation passage puts forward not a\nnaturalistic solution, but a theistic one. The meditator\nfinally concludes that he\u2019s awake because, as the passage\nexplicitly reads, \u201cGod is not a deceiver\u201d (AT 7:90, CSM\n2:62).\n\nHow does his argument go? Recall, in the proof of the external\nmaterial world\n (Section 7.2),\n that Descartes mysteriously invokes the following (divinely\nguaranteed) truth rule:\n\nI am not in error in cases in which (i) I have a natural propensity to\nbelieve, and (ii) God provided me no faculty by which to correct a\nfalse such belief.\n\n\nThe dreaming passage looks to have Descartes again invoking this rule.\nThe passage opens with the meditator observing the following:\n\nI can almost always make use of more than one sense to investigate the\nsame thing; and in addition, I can use both my memory, which connects\npresent experiences with preceding ones, and my intellect, which has\nby now examined all the causes of error. Accordingly, I should not\nhave any further fears about the falsity of what my senses tell me\nevery day; on the contrary, the exaggerated doubts of the last few\ndays should be dismissed as laughable. This applies especially to\n\u2026 my inability to distinguish between being asleep and being\nawake. (AT 7:89, CSM 2:61)\n\n\nReferring to the worry that he\u2019s presently dreaming as\nexaggerated suggests that condition (i) is met \u2013 i.e.,\nsuggesting that the present circumstance includes a \u201cnatural\npropensity\u201d to believe he\u2019s awake. As such, he needs only\nto establish condition (ii), and he\u2019ll have a divine guarantee\nof being awake. Here, notice that an important theme of the above\npassage concerns the meditator\u2019s faculties for correcting\nsensory error \u2013 a theme suggestive of condition (ii). In\ncontext, Descartes\u2019 appeal to the continuity test is perhaps\nbest understood in conjunction with condition (ii). As the meditator\nsays (speaking of his apparently waking experience):\n\n[W]hen I distinctly see where things come from and where and when they\ncome to me, and when I can connect my perceptions of them with the\nwhole of the rest of my life without a break, then I am quite certain\nthat when I encounter these things I am not asleep but awake. And I\nought not to have even the slightest doubt of their reality if,\nafter calling upon all the senses as well as my memory and my\nintellect in order to check them, I receive no conflicting reports\nfrom any of these sources. For from the fact that God is not\na deceiver it follows that in cases like these I am\ncompletely free from error. (AT 7:90, CSM 2:62; italics added)\n\n\nCentral to the inference is the meditator\u2019s effort to check the\ncorrectness of his belief, by means of his various faculties. The\ncases like these to which Descartes refers look to be those\nwhere conditions (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. Recall what\nDescartes writes in conjunction with the proof of the external\nmaterial world: from \u201cthe very fact that God is not a\ndeceiver\u201d there is a \u201cconsequent impossibility of there\nbeing any falsity in my opinions which cannot be corrected by some\nother faculty supplied by God\u201d (AT 7:80, CSM 2:55f). Perhaps,\ntherefore, we can understand Descartes\u2019 theistic solution to the\nNow Dreaming Doubt as building on the same rule he employs in\nhis proof for the external material world.\n\nWhat about Hobbes\u2019s other objection \u2013 in effect, that one\ncould dream both (i) and (ii)? Descartes\u2019 response:\n\u201cA dreamer cannot really connect his dreams with the ideas of\npast events, though he may dream that he does. For everyone admits\nthat a man may be deceived in his sleep\u201d (AT 7:196, CSM 2:137).\nPerhaps Descartes thinks the situation with dreaming parallels that of\nwaking life: those who are sufficiently tired, or otherwise\nperceptually inattentive, \u201ccannot really\u201d perceive truths\nclearly and distinctly, though it may seem to them that they\ndo. Whether in waking or dreaming, the Fourth Meditation theodicy has\nGod allowing us to make judgment errors, provided that they are\ncorrectable. Descartes is committed to holding that when our\nperception is confused, we can in principle come to discover the\nconfusion \u2013 even if not easily. When we lack clear and distinct\nperception, we are at fault (not God) for any resulting judgments, in\npart because we can discover that our perception is confused.\nDescartes needs it that the same principle holds even while dreaming.\n(And again, nearly the entirety of the Meditations unfolds\nunder the supposition that, for all we know, we may presently be\ndreaming.) For the case at hand \u2013 i.e., the possibility of\nmistakenly judging that I\u2019m awake, while in a dream\n\u2013 Descartes needs it that we could, in principle, discover that\nwe\u2019re mistaken. Apropos of condition (ii), therefore, is whether\nGod has provided us a faculty by which to discover that we\u2019re\ndreaming, on occasions when we wrongly believe ourselves to be awake.\nEvidently, Descartes thinks so, as he tells Gassendi:\n\nWhen, for example, we are asleep and are aware that we are dreaming,\nwe need imagination in order to dream, but to be aware that we are\ndreaming we need only the intellect. (Replies 5, AT 7:358f, CSM 2:248)\n\n\nImportantly, Descartes does not say we can easily correct the\nmistake of dreaming that we\u2019re awake. To the contrary,\nthe Sixth Meditation treatment of the Now Dreaming Doubt closes with a\nconcession that his solution is perhaps more theoretical than\npractical:\n\nBut since the pressure of things to be done does not always allow us\nto stop and make such a meticulous check, it must be admitted that in\nthis human life we are often liable to make mistakes about particular\nthings, and we must acknowledge the weakness of our nature. (AT 7:90,\nCSM 2:62)\n\n\nThus the importance of Descartes\u2019 First Meditation remark that\n\u201cno danger or error will result\u201d from the program of\nmethodical doubt, \u201cbecause the task now in hand does not involve\naction\u201d (AT 7:22, CSM 2:15). Methodical doubt should not be\napplied to practical matters. Prudence dictates that when making\npractical decisions I should assume I\u2019m awake, even if I\ndon\u2019t perfectly know that I\u2019m awake. Judgment errors made\nwhile mistakenly assuming I\u2019m awake do not have\nactual practical consequences, unlike those made while mistakenly\nassuming I\u2019m dreaming.\n\n(For further discussion, see Newman 1999, Williams 1978, and\nWilson 1978.)\n9. Self-Knowledge\n9.1 That Mind is Better-Known than Body\n\nDescartes holds that our judgments about our own minds are\nepistemically better-off than our judgments about bodies. In our\nnatural, pre-reflective condition, however, we\u2019re apt to confuse\nthe sensory images of bodies with the external things themselves, a\nconfusion leading us to think our judgments about bodies are\nepistemically impressive. The confusion is clearly expressed\n(Descartes would say) in G. E. Moore\u2019s famous claim to knowledge\n\u2013 \u201cHere is a hand\u201d \u2013 along with his more\ngeneral defense of common sense:\n\nI begin, then, with my list of truisms, every one of which (in my own\nopinion) I know, with certainty, to be true. \u2026 There\nexists at present a living human body, which is my body. This\nbody was born at a certain time in the past, and has existed\ncontinuously ever since \u2026 But the earth had existed also for\nmany years before my body was born \u2026 (1962, 32f)\n\n\nIn contrast, Descartes writes:\n\n[I]f I judge that the earth exists from the fact that I touch it or\nsee it, this very fact undoubtedly gives even greater support for the\njudgement that my mind exists. For it may perhaps be the case that I\njudge that I am touching the earth even though the earth does not\nexist at all; but it cannot be that, when I make this judgement, my\nmind which is making the judgement does not exist. (Prin.\n1:11, AT 8a:8f, CSM 1:196)\n\n\nMethodical doubt is intended to help us appreciate the folly of the\ncommonsensical position \u2013 helping us recognize that perception\nof our own minds is \u201cnot simply prior to and more certain\n\u2026 but also more evident\u201d than perception of our own\nbodies (Prin. 1:11, AT 8a:8, CSM 1:196). \u201cDisagreement\non this point,\u201d writes Descartes, comes from \u201cthose who\nhave not done their philosophizing in an orderly way\u201d; from\nthose who, while properly acknowledging the \u201ccertainty of their\nown existence,\u201d mistakenly \u201ctake \u2018themselves\u2019\nto mean only their bodies\u201d \u2013 failing to \u201crealize\nthat they should have taken \u2018themselves\u2019 in this context\nto mean their minds alone\u201d (Prin. 1:12, AT 8a:9, CSM\n1:196).\n\nIn epistemological contexts, Descartes purports to establish the\nmind-better-known-than-body doctrine with methodical doubt. For\nexample, while reflecting on his epistemic position in regard both to\nhimself, and to the wax, the Second Meditation meditator says: \n\nSurely my awareness of my own self is not merely much truer and more\ncertain than my awareness of the wax, but also much more distinct and\nevident. For if I judge that the wax exists from the fact that I see\nit, clearly this same fact entails much more evidently that I myself\nalso exist. It is possible that what I see is not really the wax; it\nis possible that I do not even have eyes with which to see anything.\nBut when I see, or think I see (I am not here distinguishing the two),\nit is simply not possible that I who am now thinking am not something.\n(AT 7:33, CSM 2:22)\n\n\nFurther reasons might be helping to motivate Descartes\u2019 view.\nOn the kind of representational theory of perception that is widely \nattributed to him, our sense organs and nerves serve as literal mediating links in the causal chains generating sense perception:\nthey stand between (both spatially and causally) external things themselves, and the brain events occasioning our perceptual\nawareness (cf. Prin. 4:196). In veridical sensation, the \nobjects of immediate sensory awareness are not external bodies \nthemselves, nor are we immediately aware of the states of our sense \norgans or nerves. Rather, the objects of immediate awareness are \n\u2013 whether in veridical sensation, or in dreams \u2013 the \nmind\u2019s own ideas. Descartes indeed holds that the\nfact of physiological mediation helps explain delusional ideas,\nbecause roughly the same kinds of physiological processes that\nproduce waking ideas are employed in producing delusional ideas:\n\n[I]t is the soul which sees, and not the eye; and it does not see\ndirectly, but only by means of the brain. That is why madmen and those\nwho are asleep often see, or think they see, various objects which are\nnevertheless not before their eyes: namely, certain vapours disturb\ntheir brain and arrange those of its parts normally engaged in vision\nexactly as they would be if these objects were present.\n(Optics, AT 6:141, CSM 1:172; cf. AT 7:85ff and AT 11:248f)\n\n\nVarious passages of the Meditations lay important groundwork\nfor this theory of perception. For instance, one of the messages of\nthe wax passage is that sensory awareness does not reach to external\nthings themselves: \n\nWe say that we see the wax itself, if it is there before us, not that\nwe judge it to be there from its colour or shape; and this might lead\nme to conclude without more ado that knowledge of the wax comes from\nwhat the eye sees, and not from the scrutiny of the mind alone. But\nthen if I look out of the window and see men crossing the square, as I\njust happen to have done, I normally say that I see the men\nthemselves, just as I say that I see the wax. Yet do I see any more\nthan hats and coats which could conceal automatons? I judge\nthat they are men. (Med. 2, AT 7:32, CSM 2:21)\n\n\nDescartes thinks we\u2019re apt to be \u201ctricked by ordinary\nways of talking\u201d (ibid.). In ordinary contexts we \ndon\u2019t say that it seems there are men outside the \nwindow; we say that we see them. Nor, in such contexts,\nare our beliefs about those men apt to result from conscious, \ninferentially complex judgments, say, like this one: \u201cWell,\nI appear to be awake, and the window pane looks clean, and \nthere\u2019s plenty of light outside, and so on, and I thus\nconclude that I am seeing men outside the window.\u201d Even\nso, our ordinary ways of speaking and thinking often mislead. \nDescartes\u2019 view is that the mind\u2019s immediate perception \ndoes not, strictly speaking, extend beyond itself, to external\nbodies. This is an important basis of the mind-better-known-than-body \ndoctrine. In the concluding paragraph of the Second Meditation, \nDescartes writes:\n\nI see that without any effort I have now finally got back to\nwhere I wanted. I now know that even bodies are not strictly\n[proprie] perceived by the senses or the faculty of\nimagination but by the intellect alone, and that this perception\nderives not from their being touched or seen but from their being\nunderstood; and in view of this I know plainly that I can achieve an\neasier and more evident perception of my own mind than of anything\nelse. (AT 7:34, CSM 2:22f)\n\n\nThe understanding of ideas as the only immediate objects of\nawareness arises in a number of texts. In the Sixth Meditation,\nwhile discussing sense perception and our ideas of external things, \nDescartes writes that the mind\u2019s sensation extends strictly\nand immediately only to the ideas: \u201cthe ideas were, strictly \nspeaking, the only immediate objects of my sensory awareness\n[solas proprie et immediate sentiebam]\u201d (AT 7:75,\nCSM 2:52). The Second Replies defines thought \u201cto \ninclude everything that is within us in such a way that we are \nimmediately aware of it\u201d; it defines idea in\nterms of the \u201cimmediate perception\u201d that makes us \n\u201caware of the thought\u201d (AT 7:160, CSM 2:113). And\nin the Third Replies Descartes writes: \u201cI make it quite\nclear in several places \u2026 that I am taking the word \n\u2018idea\u2019 to refer to whatever is immediately perceived\nby the mind\u201d (AT 7:181, CSM 2:127).\n\nComplicating an understanding of such passages is that Descartes\nscholarship is divided on whether to attribute to him some version of\nan indirect theory of perception, or instead some version of a direct\ntheory. According to indirect perception accounts, in normal sensation\nthe mind\u2019s perception of bodies is mediated by an awareness of\nits ideas of those bodies. By contrast, direct perception\ninterpretations allow that in normal sensation the mind\u2019s ideas\nplay a mediating role, though this role doesn\u2019t have ideas\nfunctioning as items of awareness; rather, the objects of direct\nawareness are the external things, themselves. On both accounts, ideas\nmediate our perception of external objects. On direct theory accounts,\nthe mediating role is only a process role. By analogy, various brain\nprocesses mediate our perception of external objects, but in the\nnormal course of perception we are not consciously aware of\nthose processes; and likewise for the mind\u2019s ideas,\naccording to direct perception accounts. On one recent version of an\nindirect perception interpretation, sensory ideas mediate our\nperception of the external bodies they\u2019re of, in much the same\nway that pictures (or other representational media) mediate our\nperception of what they portray (Newman 2009). More generally,\nDescartes seems to view all ideas as mental pictures, of a sort. As he\nwrites: \u201cthe term \u2018idea\u2019 is strictly\nappropriate\u201d only for thoughts that \u201care as it were the\nimages of things\u201d (Med. 3, AT 7:37, CSM 2:25); he adds that\n\u201cthe ideas in me are like {pictures, or} images\u201d (Med. 3,\nAT 7:42, CSM 2:29). \n\nIndirect perception interpretations have figured prominently in the\nhistory of Descartes scholarship. A number of recent commentators,\nhowever, have challenged this traditional view. For example,\nCarriero defends a direct perception interpretation: \u201cI don\u2019t read Descartes as holding that I am (immediately)\naware only of my sensory ideas and only subsequently (and perhaps \nindirectly) aware of bodies or their qualities\u201d (2009, 25).\nThus on Carriero\u2019s reading, Descartes\u2019 broader argument \nrebutting our doubts about the external world is not to be understood \nas an effort to get on the other side (as it were) of our ideas:\n\nThe argument (as I understand it) is not intended to get us from a\nrealm of inner mental objects (\u201csensory ideas\u201d) to some\nother realm of outer, physical objects (\u201cbodies\u201d); rather,\nit is to confirm our instinctive feeling that we have been receiving\ninformation (\u201cdirectly\u201d) from outer objects, bodies, all\nalong. (2009, 26)\n\n\n(For further discussion of Descartes\u2019 theory of ideas and\nperception, see Carriero 2009, Chappell 1986, Cunning 2010,\nHoffman 1996 and 2009, Jolley 1990, Nadler 2006, Nelson 1997, \nNewman 2009, 2011, and Smith 2014.)\n9.2 Whether We Perfectly Know Our Own Minds\n\nWe have seen that the proper use of our cognitive faculties requires\nus to withhold assent except when our perception is clear and distinct\n\u2013 indeed, that forming judgments in accord with the C&D Rule\nprovides the only guarantee of truth. Let\u2019s apply this standard\nto introspective judgments. Suppose that the present contents of my \nmind include a confused array of ideas \u2013 say, a confused \nassemblage of auditory ideas, or color ideas, or perhaps I am\npresently flooded with a confused assortment of ideas of emotion.\nIn such cases, the proper use of my faculties requires me to withhold \njudgment about the present state of my mind.\n\nIt is surprising, therefore, to learn that on the standard view in\nDescartes scholarship, he holds a strong view of privileged access\nguaranteeing the truth of all introspective judgments about\nthe present contents of our own minds. The usual result is an\ninfallibility thesis whereby judgments about our own mental states\ncannot be mistaken if based on introspective awareness: if\nI seem to be in mental state x, then I am\nin x. (A variety of related doctrines are also sometimes\nattributed to him, including the indubitability of the mental\n\u2013 roughly, that introspective judgments are indubitable;\nand omniscience with respect to the mental \u2013 roughly,\nthat one has knowledge of every true proposition about one\u2019s own\npresent contents of consciousness. There is some variation in the way\nthese doctrines are formulated in the literature.)\n\nAt least two lines of argument are widely cited in support of this\nstandard interpretation. One draws on the transparency doctrine. The\nother draws on texts interpreted as providing support. Let\u2019s \nexamine both.\n\nThe transparency doctrine has it that we are aware of everything\noccurring in our minds \u2013 this, a result of Descartes\u2019 view\nthat thinking constitutes the whole essence of\nmind:\n\nAs to the fact that there can be nothing in the mind, in so far as it\nis a thinking thing, of which it is not aware, this seems to me to be\nself-evident. For there is nothing that we can understand to be in the\nmind, regarded in this way, that is not a thought or dependent on a\nthought. \u2026 and we cannot have any thought of which we are not\naware at the very moment when it is in us. (Replies 4, AT 7:246, CSM\n2:171f)\n\n\nAdd to this that, unlike with external sensation, there is no\nintrospective appearance/reality gap, and there can seem to be no room\nfor introspective errors. Zeno Vendler explains:\n\nIf the mind, at any given time, is identical with a certain complex of\nthoughts \u2026 then the very idea of a medium between the\nmind and its thoughts is impossible from the outset. Accordingly, it\nis an understatement to say that the mind knows its thoughts;\nthe mind is these thoughts. (1972, 191)\n\n\nKenny adds:\n\nThe occurrence of thoughts is not open to doubt or error. Thoughts\ncannot occur without our knowing that they occur, and we cannot think\nthat a thought is occurring unless that thought actually is occurring.\n(1968, 72)\n\n\nIn opposition to this standard interpretation, note that from the\nfact that I have awareness of whatever is occurring in my mind, it\ndoes not follow that I have distinct awareness. If\nwhat\u2019s occurring in my mind is a confused muddle of ideas, then\nI\u2019ll be aware of a confused muddle of ideas. But in that case,\nforming a judgment about the present state of my mind is a recipe for\nerror \u2013 i.e., given the Fourth Meditation account of proper\njudgment. The situation is arguably better in cases in which I\nam experiencing fewer and simpler ideas; this is because such ideas\nare generally easier to render clear and distinct. Even so, such\nideas must actually be rendered as clear and distinct.\nNoteworthy is that Descartes writes, of \u201csensations, emotions\nand appetites,\u201d that \u201cwe are frequently wrong in our \njudgements concerning them\u201d; adding, that we can avoid such\nerrors \u201cprovided we take great care in our judgements\nconcerning them to include no more than what is strictly contained\nin our perception \u2013 no more than that of which we have inner\nawareness\u201d (Prin 1:66, AT 8a:32, CSM 1:216).\n\nConsider another case that seems at odds with the standard\ninterpretation. Were Descartes committed to introspective\ninfallibility, then he should say that we could never\nbe mistaken as to whether our occurring ideas are ideas of\nsensation, or instead ideas of imagination\noccurring in a dream. Yet as we\u2019ve seen, he takes\ndreaming-based scepticism utterly seriously.\n\nWhat about the textual line of argument regularly cited in support\nof the standard interpretation? Consider two Meditations\npassages that can seem to entail the infallibility thesis:\n\n\nI certainly seem to see, to hear, and to be warmed. This\ncannot be false; what is called \u201chaving a sensory\nperception\u201d is strictly just this, and in this restricted sense\nof the term it is simply thinking. (Med. 2, AT 7:29, CSM 2:19)\n\nNow as far as ideas are concerned, provided they are considered solely\nin themselves and I do not refer them to anything else, they cannot\nstrictly speaking be false; for whether it is a goat or a chimera that\nI am imagining, it is just as true that I imagine the former as the\nlatter. As for the will and the emotions, here too one need not worry\nabout falsity; for even if the things which I may desire are wicked or\neven non-existent, that does not make it any less true that I desire\nthem. (Med. 3, AT 7:37, CSM 2:26)\n\n\nPrima facie, it is plausible to take such passages to entail that if\nI seem to be having an idea of blue, or an idea of a noise,\nor of warmth, etc., then I am. Indeed, one might take such\npassages to convey that judgments to this effect \u201ccannot be\nfalse\u201d because introspective judgments are infallible.\nBut note the continuation of the second passage: \u201cThus the only\nremaining thoughts where I must be on my guard against making a\nmistake are judgements.\u201d This suggests that these passages can\nbe read in a very different way. Accordingly, a mere seeming\n\u201ccannot be false\u201d because it is not the kind of mental\nstate that could be false; on Descartes\u2019 view,\nfalsity arises not simply from the mind\u2019s awareness\nof its ideas, but from judgments \u2013 i.e., from acts of will \nassenting to those items of awareness. Read in this way, these\npassages anticipate the Fourth Meditation theory of judgment:\n\nNow all that the intellect does is to enable me to perceive the ideas\nwhich are subjects for possible judgements; and when regarded strictly\nin this light, it turns out to contain no error in the proper sense of\nthat term. (AT 7:56, CSM 2:39)\n\n\nArguably, Descartes\u2019 mind-better-known-than-body\ndoctrine is intended as a comparative rather than a\nsuperlative thesis. We have seen that, for Descartes, the\nonly superlative perceptual state is that of clarity and distinctness.\nThis suggests that the only guarantee of truth in our introspective \njudgments is, like all other judgments, that they be based on clear \nand distinct perception: if I clearly and distinctly perceive myself\nto be in mental state x, then I am in x.\n\n(For further discussion of related issues in Descartes, see Alanen \n2003, Broughton 2008, Curley 2006, Jolley 2013, Kenny 1968,\nLoLordo 2005, McRae 1972, Newman 2023, Nolan & Whipple 2005,\nVendler 1972, and Wilson 1978.)",
