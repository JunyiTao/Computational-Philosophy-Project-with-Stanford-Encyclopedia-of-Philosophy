    "main_text": "\n\nLevels of organization are structures in nature, frequently identified\nby part-whole relationships, with things at higher levels being\ncomposed of things at the next lower level. Typical levels of\norganization that one finds in the literature include the atomic,\nmolecular, cellular, tissue, organ, organismal, group, population,\ncommunity, ecosystem, landscape, and biosphere levels. References to\nlevels of organization and related leveled depictions of nature are\nprominent in the life sciences and their philosophical study, and\nappear not only in introductory textbooks and lectures, but also in\ncutting-edge research articles and reviews. In philosophy, perennial\ndebates such as reduction, emergence, mechanistic explanation,\ninterdisciplinary relations, natural selection, and many other topics,\nalso rely substantially on the notion.\n\nYet, in spite of the ubiquity of the notion, levels of organization\nhave received little explicit attention in biology or its philosophy.\nUsually the concept appears in the background as an implicit\nconceptual framework that is associated with vague intuitions.\nAttempts at providing general and broadly applicable definitions of\nlevels of organization have not met wide acceptance. In recent years,\nseveral authors have put forward localized accounts of levels, and\nothers have raised doubts about the usefulness of the notion as a\nwhole.\n\nThough there are many phrases that qualify \u2018levels\u2019 in\nphilosophy, science, and everyday life, such as levels of abstraction,\nrealization, being, analysis, processing, theory, science, or\ncomplexity, in this article we will focus only on levels of\norganization and debates associated with this concept. Other\nlevel-phrases will only be discussed insofar as they are relevant to\nthis main topic.\n",
