    "main_text": "Criteria and Meaning\n13. Criteria and Meaning\n\nThe problems with Beardsley\u2019s argument are significant enough to\nconclude that it needn\u2019t be accepted. The question still\nremains, however, whether an author\u2019s intention that\n\u2018S\u2019 means M is criterial evidence for\nits meaning M. That question can be asked independently of\nBeardsley\u2019s argument, but on the assumption that his preferred\ntheory of meaning is correct (thereby, as in much of the above,\nputting to the side general objections to speech act theory and speech\nact theories of meaning) or on the assumption that another theory of\nmeaning is correct. As far as the question at issue is concerned, in\nother words, it probably doesn\u2019t make much difference whether\nthe Beardsley/Alston theory is correct, or some other theory is. In\nall likelihood, the result would be the same. But regardless of\nwhether it would or wouldn\u2019t, exploring alternative theories of\nmeaning is impossible in this context, so only the Alston/Beardsley\ntheory will be considered below.\n\nIn addition, though, and as Beardsley\u2019s argument in effect\nreminds us, there might be important differences between non-literary\nand literary discourse, such that what holds (or doesn\u2019t hold)\nin one doesn\u2019t hold (or holds) in the other. The very nature of\nliterature might itself make a difference. Two determinations are\nneeded, then, one respecting the relevance or irrelevance of an\nauthors\u2019 intentions in non-literary discourse and one respecting\nwhether the fact that a discourse is literary makes it importantly\ndifferent from non-literary discourse as far as the relevance of\nauthors\u2019 intentions is concerned. In what follows, the issue\nconcerning non-literary discourse will be discussed first and at\nlength; the issue concerning literary discourse, second and much more\nbriefly.\n\nOn a speech act theory of meaning, the inference from\n\n(1)\nThe author intended x to mean p in work\nw\n\n\nto\n\n(2)\nx means p in work w\n\n\nis the inference from\n\n(A)\nThe author intended x to mean p in writing work\nw\n\n\nto\n\n(B)\nx means p in work w.\n\n\nFurther glossed in terms of speech acts (but slurring over\nconsiderations of intensionality), this is the inference from\n\n(C)\nThe author intended x to have illocutionary act potential\nz in writing x in work w\n\n\nto\n\n(D)\nx has illocutionary act potential z in work\nw,\n\n\nwhere the inference is supposedly criterial, and z is the\ntotal illocutionary act potential\u2014the potential to perform\nillocutionary acts I, J, K\u2014that\nconstitutes the meaning of x. The question at issue here is a\nspecies of a genus, the genus being whether intending that s\nis p is criterial evidence for s\u2019s being\np, with the differentia being that s is a piece of\nnon-literary discourse and p a meaning, a speech act\npotential.\n\nAnswering this question requires taking a slight detour. In the 1950s\nand 1960s premises respecting behavior were frequently said to be\ncriterial evidence for the existence of mental states of certain kinds\n(though the matter wasn\u2019t very clearly delineated or explained,\nand the term \u201ccriterial evidence\u201d didn\u2019t exist). The\nmost discussed example, originating in the work of Wittgenstein,\nconcerned pain behavior and pain: a person\u2019s pain behavior was\nsaid to be criterial evidence for his being in pain. The inference\nfrom (C) to (D) is, near enough, the converse inference, from a mental\nstate to behavior or, more properly, from a mental state to an effect,\nan object (a piece of discourse) having a certain property (a certain\nspeech act potential).\n\nThe central question to ask about any supposed criterial inference is\nwhether we understand the nature of the phenomena mentioned in the\npremise and conclusion to be necessarily caught up with other, but not\nin such a way that the presence of either entails the other. If\nA is a criterion of B, then it\u2019s a necessary\ntruth that A is evidence for, or counts toward,\nB\u2014so says Anthony Kenny in speaking of a criterion in\nthe sense intended here. If a criterion is understood in this\nway\u2014and the term is certainly being used in a technical,\nnon-everyday sense if it is\u2014there\u2019s a fair amount of\nintuitive appeal to the claim that pain behavior is a criterion for\nbeing in pain. Our understanding of what pain and pain behavior are\nseems to connect the two necessarily. That\u2019s true even if no one\nin pain ever exhibits pain behavior, or everyone exhibits pain\nbehavior when not in pain. (Admittedly, the scenarios for either state\nof affairs would be very strange. Neither is impossible, though.)\nLikewise, although every act of lying could turn out to be right, and\nevery act of non-lying turn out to be wrong, our understanding of what\nwrongness and lying are is such that the latter necessarily counts\ntoward the former. On the other hand, our understanding of drinking\narsenic and dying\u2014of what they are\u2014isn\u2019t such that\ndrinking arsenic is criterial for dying. It\u2019s not that our\nunderstanding of dying is somehow necessarily caught up with the idea\nof drinking arsenic the way it is in the pain-pain behavior and\nlying-wrongness cases. Even if every time a person drank arsenic he\ndied, and every time a person died he had drunk arsenic, the\nconnection between the two is purely inductive.\n\nHow is it then with the inference from\n\n(C)\nThe author intended x to have illocutionary act potential\nz in writing x in work w\n\n\nto\n\n(D)\nx has illocutionary act potential z in work\nw?\n\n\nConsider an example discussed on a number of occasions by Beardsley\nand already cited above: Humpty Dumpty. Humpty Dumpty says,\n\u201cThere\u2019s glory for you!\u201d, and his sentence, he\nclaims, means there\u2019s a nice knockdown argument for you. Alice\ndoesn\u2019t believe him. It means that, Humpty Dumpty explains,\nbecause \u201cwhen I use a word, it means just what I choose\nit to mean\u2014neither more nor less\u201d. Alice doubts that he\ncan make the sentence mean that just by choosing that it mean that.\nCommon sense is certainly on her side. Beardsley\u2019s reply is a\nlittle different. He says that because Humpty Dumpty has provided no\nstipulative definition of \u201cglory\u201d, he knows that Alice\ncan\u2019t be expected to \u201csecure uptake\u201d, that is,\nunderstand the novel meaning he attaches to use of the word, and thus\ncan\u2019t intend to perform the speech act of boasting that his\nargument for the superiority of unbirthdays to birthdays is a\nconclusive one. Since meaning is constituted by speech act potential,\nhe therefore can\u2019t intend to mean \u201cnice knockdown\nargument\u201d by \u201cglory\u201d (II: 202\u2013203).\n\nWhat Beardsley says here is basically correct. To show that the\nintentional fallacy is indeed a fallacy, however, to show that (C)\nisn\u2019t criterial evidence for (D), the premise concerning the\nauthor\u2019s intention should be assumed to be true, and the\nstrength of the inference gauged on that assumption. If a fallacy has\nindeed been committed, the premise, considered simply by itself, will\nlend no support to the conclusion. But instead of examining the case\nof Humpty Dumpty as just indicated, Beardsley questions the truth of\nthe premise, and correctly finds it wanting. That isn\u2019t to the\npoint.\n\nIn fact, several things might be said in favor of a criterial relation\nbetween (C) and (D). First, the cases of moral rightness and pain\nsuggest that a natural home for criteria is in phenomena that are\nundeniable but unobservable. Much, if not all, of what can\u2019t be\nobserved but is obviously real needs a criterion or criteria to gain a\nfoothold in our thinking and discourse. (It could even be argued that\neverything that figures in our thinking and discourse, whether\nobservable or non-observable, stands in need of a criterion or\ncriteria. Kenny, for one, holds as much.) Linguistic meaning seems to\nbe just that sort of thing. Second, rightness, pain, and meaning,\nthough real, seem to be ontologically slighter than paradigmatically\nreal things, such as physical objects (stars), forces\n(electro-magnetism), or even everyday properties and property\ninstantiations (weighing five pounds, Philadelphia\u2019s being in\nPennsylvania). Their conceptual connections to the well-anchored items\nof everyday life\u2014rocks, gravity, shapes\u2014are few in number,\nand re-identification of one and the same pain, for example, more\ninherently problematic. A pain is not something and not nothing,\nWittgenstein wrote, and though the remark is cryptic, much the same\nseems to be true of meaning. Part of its life needs to be breathed\ninto it by criteria. Third, there\u2019s Beardsley\u2019s own\nconcession that \u201conly intentional text production can generate\nillocutionary actions\u201d, and therefore meaning, on his theory of\nmeaning. If an author\u2019s intention is necessary for a text to\nhave a meaning at all, that suggests that the intention that\nx mean m is criterial\u2014not logically necessary\nbut criterial\u2014for x\u2019s meaning m. Bolstering this\nsuggestion is the fact that it\u2019s hard to imagine that x\nmeans m, but that no one has ever intended that x mean\nm in producing a text that contains x.\n\nThese considerations, however, are more inconclusive hints at\narguments than arguments themselves. First, the fact that meanings are\nunobservable but real suggests that we should be on the lookout for\ncriteria; it doesn\u2019t mean that they have criteria. More is\nneeded to show that. Numbers, it might be argued, are also\nunobservable but real, yet stand in need of no criteria. Second, apart\nfrom the obscurity of the notion of ontological slightness, meanings\nare surely no more ontologically slender than numbers, which, again,\nseem to require no criteria. Finally, there\u2019s the point that\neven if the promissory notes that really are the first two\nconsiderations can be made good on, all that would show is that\nmeaning in general stands in need of a criterion or criteria. It\nwouldn\u2019t show that a criterion of a text\u2019s having meaning\nis an author\u2019s intention that it have meaning, much less that a\ncriterion for a text\u2019s having the meaning that it has is the\nauthor\u2019s intention that it have that meaning.\n\nBut the third consideration may come to the rescue here. Beardsley\nhimself says that intentional text production is necessary for a text\nto have a meaning (an admission, incidentally, which goes against a\nnumber of things he wrote earlier in his career), and it\u2019s a\nnatural step from there to an author\u2019s intention as criterial\nfor textual meaning, indeed, as criterial for a conceptual\ncorrespondence between the two (intending to mean m, meaning m). In\naddition, even if it\u2019s not a necessary truth that if\n\u2018S\u2019 means m, someone at some time intended that\n\u2018S\u2019 mean m in producing a token of\n\u2018S\u2019, the former is at least criterial for the\nlatter.\n\nBut why the claim just mentioned isn\u2019t a necessary truth is\ninstructive. It\u2019s not because it\u2019s possible that\nA, the first and only user of \u2018S\u2019,\nmistakenly thought there was a linguistic convention according to\nwhich \u2018S\u2019 means n. Operating on that assumption,\nhe uttered \u2018S\u2019, intending it to mean n. However,\nbecause of contextual clues respecting the surroundings in which\n\u2018S\u2019 was used, because of the topic under\ndiscussion when it was used, and because of ignorance and\nmisunderstanding (of the language and of what A was driving at) on the\npart of his listeners, all his listeners took it that there was\nalready a linguistic convention according to which\n\u2018S\u2019 means m. That\u2019s how they understood\n\u2018S\u2019, and they thus believed and acted\naccordingly. A, oblivious to the misunderstanding on their part, soon\nforgets about \u2018S\u2019 and the meaning he attached to\nit. In these circumstances, \u2018S\u2019 means m\nbecause that\u2019s what the language-using community takes it to\nmean: in effect, their beliefs and behavior establish a convention\naccording to which \u2018S\u2019 means m. The meaning rests\non what might be called \u201ccommunity uptake\u201d, not individual\nuptake of speech act performance, as Beardsley has it, and not the\nspeaker\u2019s intention, as intentionalists have it.\n\nThis strange little scenario is important not so much because\nit\u2019s a counterexample to the claim that if\n\u2018S\u2019 means m, then at some time someone means\nm in using \u2018S\u2019, but as illustrating\nsomething of greater importance: the existence of a linguistic\nconvention that \u2018S\u2019 means m is a\ncriterion, in the technical sense explained above, for\n\u2018S\u2019 meaning m. It\u2019s not a logically\nsufficient condition, not definitive evidence, at least as far as the\nmeaning of a token sentence is concerned, for in specific\ncircumstances other factors may override the meaning specified by the\nconvention. That, in fact, has to be the case if metaphor, synecdoche,\nmetonymy, and irony are to be possible at all. (Briefly, a token\nsentence is a sentence considered as a concrete particular, with a\nspecifiable spatio-temporal location. Token sentences contrast with\ntype sentences. A type sentence is an abstract particular, not\nlocatable in space and time. All token sentences are tokens of a type,\nin much the same way that all token 2023 Toyota\nCorollas\u2014spatio-temporal objects found on streets and\nhighways\u2014are tokens of a single type, 2023\u00a0Toyota Corolla.\nAs far as sentences are concerned, what this amounts to is that a\nsingle type sentence, \u2018S\u2019, can have many tokens.\nThere\u2019s only one type sentence \u201cThe door is open\u201d,\nbut there are many tokens of that type, a number of which can be found\nin this article.) Linguistic conventions are one factor that has to be\nconsidered in every case of token sentence meaning. They may not be\nthe last word in determining token sentence meaning\u2014though they\nfrequently are just that\u2014but they\u2019re always the first\nword.\n\nPerhaps paradoxically, given what was just said, the counterexample\nalso illustrates a more important claim, that a speaker\u2019s\nintention that \u2018S\u2019 mean m is a criterion\nfor its meaning m, or at least very nearly so. This is because: (1)\nlinguistic convention is a criterion for token sentence meaning, and a\nlinguistic convention, as the example shows, is a function of overall\ncommunity understanding, treatment, and belief. (2) A speaker\u2019s\nintention is one component in such understanding, treatment, and\nbelief, and thus is criterial for linguistic convention. In other\nwords, since a speaker of a language is a member of the linguistic\ncommunity in which he speaks, and since, as Beardsley himself holds,\nan intention that \u2018S\u2019 means m involves a\nbelief that \u2018S\u2019 means m, the speaker\u2019s\nintention figures into the overall function that determines the\ncreation or maintenance of a convention. (3) The relation \u201cis\ncriterial for\u201d is transitive, or at least very nearly so. If\nX\u2019s being criterial for Y and Y\u2019s being criterial for Z\ndoesn\u2019t entail that X is criterial for Z, it still\nlends some near criterial support for Z. More briefly but slightly\ninaccurately, the argument is that since a speaker\u2019s intention\nthat \u2018S\u2019 means m is criterial for the\nexistence of a convention that \u2018S\u2019 means m, and\nthe existence of a convention that \u2018S\u2019 means\nm is criterial for \u2018S\u2019\u2019s meaning\nm, a speaker\u2019s intention that \u2018S\u2019 means\nm is criterial for \u2018S\u2019 meaning m. A\nspeaker\u2019s intention must thus be regarded as having some\nevidential weight in determining his sentence\u2019s meaning. As far\nas everyday discourse is concerned, then, the intentional fallacy is\nno fallacy at all, strictly speaking.\n",
