    "main_text": "Other Approaches to Computability || Post\n3.2 Post\n\nBy 1936, Post had arrived independently at an analysis of\neffectiveness that was substantially the same as Turing\u2019s (Post\n1936; Davis & Sieg 2015). Post\u2019s idealized human\n\u201cworker\u201d\u2014or \u201cproblem\nsolver\u201d\u2014operated in a \u201csymbol space\u201d\nconsisting of \u201ca two way infinite sequence of spaces or\nboxes\u201d. A box admitted\n\n\nof but two possible conditions, i.e., being empty or unmarked, and\nhaving a single mark in it, say a vertical stroke. (Post 1936:\n103)\n\n\nThe problem solver worked in accordance with \u201ca fixed\nunalterable set of directions\u201d and could perform a small number\nof \u201cprimitive acts\u201d (Post 1936: 103), namely:\n\ndetermine whether the box that is presently occupied is marked or\nnot;\nerase any mark in the box that is presently occupied;\nmark the box that is presently occupied if it is unmarked;\nmove to the box to the right of the present position; and\nmove to the box to the left of the present position.\n\n\nPost\u2019s paper was submitted for publication in October 1936, some\nfive months after Turing\u2019s. It contained no analog of\nTuring\u2019s universal computing machine, and nor did it anticipate\nChurch\u2019s and Turing\u2019s result that the Entscheidungsproblem\nis unsolvable. Curiously, though, Post had achieved far more than he\nlet on in his 1936 paper. In an article subtitled \u201cAccount of an\nAnticipation\u201d, published in 1965 but written in about 1941, he\nexplained that during the early 1920s he had devised a system\u2014he\ncalled it the \u201ccomplete normal system\u201d, because \u201cin\na way, it contains all normal systems\u201d\u2014and this, he said,\n\u201ccorrespond[ed]\u201d to Turing\u2019s universal machine (Post\n1965: 412). Furthermore, he argued during the same period that the\ndecision problem is unsolvable in the case of his \u201cnormal\nsystems\u201d (1965: 405ff). But it seems he did not extend this\nargument to anticipate the Church-Turing result that the decision\nproblem for the predicate calculus is unsolvable (1965: 407).\n\nTuring later generously acknowledged Post\u2019s 1936 paper,\ndescribing Turing machines as \u201cthe logical computing machines\nintroduced by Post and the author\u201d (Turing 1950b: 491).\n",
