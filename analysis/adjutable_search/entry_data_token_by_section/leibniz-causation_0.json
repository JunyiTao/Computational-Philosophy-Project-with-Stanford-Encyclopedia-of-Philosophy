    "main_text": "Competing Theories of Causation\n1. Competing Theories of Causation\n\nLeibniz assumes that all events have causes\u2014they do not just\nhappen\u2014and typically considers only three theories of causation\nworthy of philosophical consideration: physical influx, occasionalism,\nand parallelism. Interestingly, Leibniz excludes from this list\nSpinoza\u2019s aspect theory of causation. For it is apparent that\nLeibniz thinks that any view that entails the existence of one and\nonly one genuine substance can not even begin to offer a proper theory\nof causation. Let\u2019s summarize in turn each of the theories that\nLeibniz does take seriously.\n\nAccording to the theory of physical influx, there is an inflow between\ncause and effect; in other words, there is intersubstantial causation\namong finite (i.e., non-divine) substances. So, for instance, when\nJimi Hendrix appears to strum his guitar, he really is the cause of\nthe vibration of the strings. In this case, motion is a mode or state\nof the body of Hendrix and is transferred or communicated to the body\nof his guitar. Interestingly, the term \u2018physical\u2019\nnotwithstanding, the theory of physical influx is not limited to\nmaterial finite substances. For physical influx sometimes is invoked\nto explain the causal interaction among immaterial finite substances\n(e.g., minds) and material finite substances (e.g., bodies).\nAccordingly, it is more accurate to take the term\n\u2018physical\u2019 to mean natural rather than material. Francisco\nSuarez, Thomas Hobbes, Pierre Gassendi, and Robert Boyle, among\nothers, subscribed to some variety of physical influx.\n\nOccasionalism denies causation not only among finite substances, and\nso rules out any inflow between cause and effect, but also within\nfinite substances. In other words, regarding finite substances, there\nis neither intersubstantial nor intrasubstantial causation. Taken\nindividually or jointly, finite substances have no genuine causal\nefficacy. When the strings of Hendrix\u2019s guitar vibrate, Hendrix\nis not the real cause of the vibration. Nor are his fingers, wrist,\nand arm real causes. Is the vibration then uncaused for the\noccasionalist? No, for there is God. God, thought by many of\nLeibniz\u2019s contemporaries to be the only infinite substance, is\nconsidered to be the only real cause. God causes the strings on\nHendrix\u2019s guitar to vibrate on the occasion of Hendrix\u2019s\nvolition\u2014itself caused by God\u2014to strum the strings on his\nguitar. Al-Ghazali, Nicolas Malebranche, and Louis La Forge, among\nothers, were occasionalists.\n\nLike occasionalism, the theory of parallelism holds that there is no\nintersubstantial causation among finite substances. And like\noccasionalism, when the strings of Hendrix\u2019s guitar vibrate,\nHendrix is not the real cause of the vibration. Nor, again, are his\nfingers, wrist, or arm real causes. Nevertheless, it is not God who is\nthe total real cause of this vibration. According to parallelism,\nfinite substances can be real causes. Rather the strings themselves\nare causing themselves to vibrate. Due to the special harmony between\nmind and body and not because of any direct causal relation, when\nHendrix is in a state of willing his fingers to strum the strings on\nhis guitar, the strings are in a physical state that would result in\ntheir vibration.\n\nLeibniz was and is the most famous proponent of parallelism. His\nversion is properly called \u201cpre-established harmony\u201d and\nis usually interpreted to encompass five main tenets:\n\nno change in the states of a created substance is due to another\ncreated substance (i.e., there is no intersubstantial causation);\nall (non-initial, natural) change in the states of a created\nsubstance is due (at least in part) to that substance itself (i.e.,\nthere is intrasubstantial causation);\neach created substance has a \u201cblueprint\u201d (i.e., a\ncomplete concept or law of the series) that \u201clists\u201d or\nincludes all of its states, \neach \u201cblueprint\u201d conforms with the blueprints of all\nother created substances (i.e., each of a created substance\u2019s\nnatural states cohere with all the natural states of every other\ncreated substance); and, \nthis conformity between the states of substances is set up by a\nuniversal cause, namely, God. \n\n\nFor expression of these four tenets, see, for example, Leibniz\u2019s\nletters to Arnauld, Nov. 28/Dec. 8 1686 and Apr. 30 1687, and\nMonadology \u00a781. Consider also this 1704 articulation of\nthe pre-established harmony:\n\nEach of these souls expresses in its own manner what occurs outside\nitself, and it cannot do so through any influence of other particular\nbeings (or, to put it a better way, it has to draw up [devant] this\nexpression from the depths of its own nature); and so necessarily each\nsoul must have received this nature\u2014this inner source of the\nexpression of what lies without\u2014from a universal cause\n[cause universelle], upon which all of these beings depend\nand which brings it about that each of them perfectly agrees with and\ncorresponds to the others. (New Essays A vi, 6, 440)\n\n\nAs to be expected, there is some controversy regarding the\ninterpretation of these tenets; for instance, tenet 2 is sometimes\nextended to also include non-initial states (see Whipple, 206). There\nis another important aspect of the pre-established harmony. A\nsubstance\u2019s expressions arising \u201cfrom the depths of its\nown nature\u201d are also called perceptions by Leibniz. Perception\nis \u201c[t]he passing state which involves and represents a\nmultitude in a unity\u201d (Monadology \u00a714 GP vi,\n608/AG 214). The pre-established harmony consists in the isomorphic\nmapping of perceptions and bodily motions. Whenever a substance has a\nperception x there will be a corresponding bodily state y expressing\nthat perception x. So when I perceive myself as putting a log in the\nfire \u201c[my] animal spirits and [my] blood [take] on, at exactly\nthe right moment, the motions required to correspond to the passions\nand the perceptions of [my] soul\u201d (New System GP iv,\n484/L 458).\n\nNote, however, that the five main tenets of Leibniz\u2019s\npre-established harmony leave room for God\u2019s supernatural causal\nactivity even in the actions of finite substances. In other words,\npre-established harmony, in Leibniz\u2019s hands at least, is a form\nof concurrentism. More of this will be addressed in the section on\ndivine causation, but for now it is enough to say that God\u2019s\ncausal role in the actions of finite substances at the very minimum is\nto pre-establish the concomitance or conjunction between\n\u201ccauses\u201d and \u201ceffects,\u201d without which\nGod\u2019s aim of producing universal and maximum harmony\n(Monadology \u00a7\u00a785ff) would be frustrated.\n\nWhy is Leibniz drawn to the rather bizarre-sounding pre-established\nharmony? In other words, why does he reject the more terrene physical\ninflux and the more celestial occasionalism?\n",
