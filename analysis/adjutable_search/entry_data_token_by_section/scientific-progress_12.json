    "main_text": "Theories of Scientific Progress || Knowledge and Understanding\n4. Is Science Progressive?\n\nIn Section 3.5., we made a distinction between real and estimated\nprogress in terms of the truthlikeness measures. A similar distinction\ncan be made in connection with measures of empirical success. For\nexample, one may distinguish two notions of the problem-solving\nability of a theory: the number of problems solved so far,\nand the number of solvable problems. Real progress could be\ndefined by the latter, while the former gives us an estimate of\nprogress.\n\nThe scientific realist may continue this line of thought by arguing\nthat all measures of empirical success in fact are at best indicators\nof real cognitive progress, measured in terms of truth or\ntruthlikeness. For example, if \\(T\\) explains \\(e\\), then it can be\nshown that \\(e\\) also confirms \\(T\\), or increases the\nprobability of \\(T\\) (Niiniluoto 1999b). A similar reasoning can be\nemployed to give the so-called \u201cultimate argument\u201d or\n\u201cno miracle argument\u201dfor scientific realism: theoretical\nrealism is the only assumption that does not make the empirical\nsuccess of science a miracle (Putnam, 1978; Psillos 1999; Niiniluoto\n2017; Kuipers 2019; cf. criticism in Laudan 1984b). This means that\nthe best explanation of the empirical progress of science is the\nhypothesis that science is also progressive on the level of\ntheories.\n\nThe thesis that science is progressive is an overall claim about\nscientific activities. It does not imply that each particular step in\nscience has in fact been progressive: individual scientists make\nmistakes, and even the scientific community is fallible in its\ncollective judgments. For this reason, we should not propose such a\ndefinition that the thesis about the progressive nature of science\nbecomes a tautology or an analytic truth. This undesirable consequence\nfollows if we define truth as the limit of scientific inquiry\n(this is sometimes called the consensus theory of truth), as then it\nis a mere tautology that the limit of scientific research is the truth\n(Laudan 1984a). But this \u201ctrivialization of the self-corrective\nthesis\u201d cannot be attributed to Peirce who realized that truth\nand the limit of inquiry coincide at best with probability one\n(Niiniluoto 1980). The notion of truthlikeness allows us to make sense\nof the claim that science converges towards the truth. But the\ncharacterization of progress as increasing truthlikeness, given in\nSection 3.5, does not presuppose \u201cteleological\nmetaphysics\u201d (Stegm\u00fcller 1976), \u201cconvergent\nrealism\u201d (Laudan 1984), or \u201cscientific eschatology\u201d\n(Moulines 2000), as it does not rely on any assumption about the\nfuture behavior of science.\n\nThe claim about scientific progress can still be questioned by the\ntheses that observations and ontologies are relative to theories. If\nthis is true, the comparison of rival theories appears to be\nimpossible on cognitive or rational grounds. Kuhn (1962) compared\nparadigm-changes to Gestalt switches (Dilworth 1981). Feyerabend\n(1984) concluded from his methodological anarchism that the\ndevelopment of science and art resemble each other.\n\nHanson, Popper, Kuhn, and Feyerabend agreed that all observation\nis theory-laden, so that there is no theory-neutral observational\nlanguage. Accounts of reduction and progress, which take for granted\nthe preservation of some observational statements within\ntheory-change, thus run into troubles. Even though Laudan\u2019s\naccount of progress allows Kuhn-losses, it can be argued that the\ncomparison of the problem-solving capacity of two rival theories\npresupposes some kind of correlation or translation between the\nstatements of these theories (Pearce 1987). Various replies have been\nproposed to this issue. One is the movement from language to\nstructures (Stegm\u00fcller 1976; Moulines 2000), but it turns out\nthat a reduction on the level structures already guarantees\ncommensurability, since it induces a translation between conceptual\nframeworks (Pearce 1987). Another has been the point that an evidence\nstatement \\(e\\) may happen to be neutral with respect to rival\ntheories \\(T_{1}\\) and \\(T_{2}\\), even though it is laden with some\nother theories. The realist may also point that the theory-ladenness\nof observations concerns at most the estimation of progress (EP), but\nthe definition of real progress (RP) as increasing truthlikeness does\nnot mention the notion of observation at all.\n\nEven though Popper accepted the theory-ladenness of observations, he\nrejected the more general thesis about incommensurability as\n\u201cthe myth of the framework\u201d (Lakatos and Musgrave 1970).\nPopper insisted that the growth of knowledge is always revolutionary\nin the sense that the new theory contradicts the old one by correcting\nit, but there is still continuity in theory-change, as the new theory\nshould explain why the old theory was successful to some extent.\nFeyerabend tried to claim that successive theories are both\ninconsistent and incommensurable with each other, but this combination\nmakes little sense. Kuhn argued against the possibility of finding\ncomplete translations between the languages of rival theories, but in\nhis later work he admitted the possibility that a scientist may learn\ndifferent theoretical languages (Hoyningen-Huene 1993). Kuhn kept\ninsisting that there is \u201cno theory-independent way to\nreconstruct phrases like \u2018really there\u2019,\u201d i.e., each\ntheory has its own ontology. Convergence to the truth seems to be\nimpossible, if ontologies change with theories. The same idea has been\nformulated by Putnam (1978) and Laudan (1984a) in the so-called\n\u201cpessimistic meta-induction\u201d: as many past theories in\nscience have turned out to be non-referring, there is all reason to\nexpect that even the future theories fail to refer\u2014and thus also\nfail to be approximately true or truthlike. But the optimistic reply\nby comparative realists points out that for all rejected theories in\nLaudan\u2019s list the scientists have been able to find a better,\nmore truthlike alternative (Niiniluoto 2017; Kuipers 2019).\n\nThe difficulties for realism seem to be reinforced by the observation\nthat measures of truthlikeness are relative to languages. The choice\nof conceptual frameworks cannot be decided by means of the notion of\ntruthlikeness, but needs additional criteria. In defense of the\ntruthlikeness approach, one may point to the fact that the comparison\nof two theories is relevant only in those cases where they are\nconsidered (perhaps via a suitable translation) as rival answers to\nthe same cognitive problem. It is interesting to compare\nNewton\u2019s and Einstein\u2019s theories for their truthlikeness,\nbut not Newton\u2019s and Darwin\u2019s theories. When definitions\nRP and EP are applied to rival theories in different languages, they\nhave to be translated into a common conceptual framework. \n\nAnother line is to appeal to theories of reference in order to show\nthat rival theories can after all be regarded as speaking about the\nsame entities (Psillos 1999). For example, Thompson, Bohr, and later\nphysicists are talking about the same electrons, even though their\ntheories of the electron differ from each other. This is not possible\non the standard descriptive theory of reference: a theory \\(T\\) can\nonly refer to entities about which it gives a true description.\nKuhn\u2019s and Feyerabend\u2019s meaning holism, with devastating\nconsequences for realism, presupposes this account of reference. A\nsimilar argument is used by Moulines (2000), who denies that progress\ncould be understood as \u201cknowing more about the same,\u201d but\nhis own structuralist reconstruction of progress with \u201cpartial\nincommensurability\u201d assumes that rival theories share some\nintended applications. Causal theories of reference allow that\nreference is preserved even within changes of theories (Kitcher 1993).\nThe same result is obtained if the descriptive account is modified by\nintroducing a Principle of Charity (Putnam 1975; Smith 1981;\nNiiniluoto 1999a): a theory refers to those entities about which it\ngives the most truthlike description. An alternative account,\nillustrated by the relation of phlogiston theory and oxygen theory, is\ngiven by Schurz (2011) by his notion of structural correspondence.\nThis makes it possible that even false theories are referring.\nMoreover, there can be reference invariance between two successive\ntheories, even though both of them are false; progress means then that\nthe latter theory gives a more truthlike description about their\ncommon domain than the old theory. \n",
