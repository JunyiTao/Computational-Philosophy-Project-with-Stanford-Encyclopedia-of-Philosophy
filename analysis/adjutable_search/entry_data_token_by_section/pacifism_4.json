    "main_text": "Defining Peace || Positive Peace\n1.4 Positive Peace\n\nPositive definitions of peace go beyond merely dialectical definitions\nof peace as the opposite of war and instead focus on peace as a state\nof rest, wholeness, or completion. The peace of a just and tranquil\norder points toward something like a condition of wholeness in which\nthere is solidarity, mutual respect, and satisfaction of needs. In\nthis vision of peace there is genuine community and human flourishing.\nThis includes not only the absence of direct violence but also the\nabsence of structural violence (Galtung 1969). The concept of\nstructural violence has been widely discussed in recent years in\nconnection with racism, sexism, and other forms of oppression.\nStructural violence involves very generally practices and institutions\nthat undermine human flourishing and create social tension. One\ncentral concern from the standpoint of positive peace is the project\nof criticizing and remediating structural violence. This may include\nwhat Llewellyn (2018) has called \u201cemancipatory peace,\u201d i.e., peace\nrelated to liberation or emancipation from structures of oppression.\nThis also includes the work of peace education, as well as work on\nnonviolent conflict resolution and mediation (see Fitz-Gibbon 2010).\nRelated concerns point toward the importance of justice, with a\nspecial focus on restorative justice and community building. However,\nrecent work (Davenport, Melander, and Regan, 2018) in the field of\npeace studies has argued that positive peace is both too broad and too\nvague to be of use for empirical work in peace studies. The worry is\nthat the notion of positive peace includes a broad range of social and\npolitical concerns (equality, economic justice, environmental\nsustainability, and so on) that stray far from the core idea of peace\nas the absence of direct violence. Despite this criticism, the notion\nof positive peace remains in use.\n\nThe positive ideal of peace can be found in religious conceptions of\npeace. Stanley Hauerwas has explained that some Christian pacifists\nclaim that the concept of shalom (Hebrew for \u201cpeace\u201d) is focused\non positive peace: it is more than the absence of war; rather, it is\n\u201charmony, health, and well-being in all human relations\u201d (Hauerwas\n155). Shameer Mondongal maintains that something similar is found in\nIslam, where salaam is more than the absence of war, \u201cit also\nrequires the presence of justice and an atmosphere that promotes\nself-actualization\u201d (Mondongal 2023, 18). In some traditions, this\nappears to point beyond the merely political realm and aim toward\nspiritual transformation. In Christian contexts this is related to the\npeace of God that surpasses all understanding (as in Philippians 4.7).\nIn Buddhism, this is related to the idea propounded by Thich Nhat Hanh\n(1987) of \u201cbeing peace\u201d that is connected to Buddhist\npractice. The Dalai Lama claims that peace is more than the absence of\nwar and he connects his vision of world peace to peacefulness as a\nstate of mind: \u201cpeace is a state of tranquility founded on the\ndeep sense of security that arises from mutual understanding,\ntolerance of others\u2019 point of view, and respect for their\nrights\u201d (Dalai Lama, 202). This is closely related to the ideal\nof social stability; but the Dalai Lama also connects it to the deeper\nprocess of personal transformation.\n",
