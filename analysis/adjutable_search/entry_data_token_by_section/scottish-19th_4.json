    "main_text": "Alexander Bain (1818\u20131903)\n5. Alexander Bain (1818\u20131903)\n\nAlexander Bain was Regius Professor of Logic at the University of\nAberdeen from 1860 to 1880. A man of remarkable gifts, he was\nappointed to the Chair largely on the strength of distinguished\nphilosophical work he had published while working as a journalist in\nLondon. It was there that he made the acquaintance of John Stuart Mill\nwith whom he formed a lasting friendship. Dissertations on Leading\nPhilosophical Questions (1903), is a collection of his essays\npublished in retirement, though almost all had originally appeared in\nthe journal Mind, a journal he was instrumental in founding,\nIn several of these essays, Bain takes Reid and Hamilton as his\nstarting point and, broadly, follows the same methods. But, his\nsympathy with Mill and anti-metaphysical inclinations led him to push\nthem in a much more strongly empirical direction. The most interesting\nof his Dissertations, in this connection, is entitled\n\u201cAssociationist Controversies\u201d and at the heart of these\ncontroversies we can find a distinction between philosophy and\npsychology that both reveals the significant difference between Bain\nand Ferrier, and establishes the discipline of experimental psychology\nin its own right.\n\nWe are, at the moment, in the midst of a conflict of views as to the\npriority of Metaphysics and Psychology. If indeed the two are closely\nidentified as some suppose, there is no conflict; there is in fact,\nbut one study. If, on the other hand, there are two subjects, each\nought to be carried on apart for a certain length, before they can\neither confirm or weaken each other. I believe that in strictness, a\ndisinterested Psychology should come first in order, and that, after\ngoing on a little way in amassing the facts, it should revise its\nfundamental assumptions\u2026I do not see any mode of attaining a\ncorrect Metaphysics until Psychology has at least made some way upon a\nprovisional Metaphysics (Bain 1903, 38)\n\n\nBain can be interpreted as a practitioner of the \u201cscience of\nmind\u201d no less than Reid or Hume. But whereas in Reid and Hume\n(and Ferrier) the distinction between philosophy and psychology as the\nmodern world understands it, was unclear, it is one of Bain's chief\nclaims to enduring significance that, as this quotation reveals, he\nbrought the distinction between psychological and metaphysical\nquestions to prominence, and in what would now be called his research\nprogramme he gave priority to the former. The conclusion to be drawn\nis that Bain, like Ferrier, can be seen to stand in the tradition of\nScottish philosophy in the sense that he adopted its methods. But in\ncontrast to Ferrier, he did so in ways that further removed the\nquestion of sensation and perception from the realms of traditional\nmetaphysics, and pressed the study of the mind in the direction of\nempirical psychology.\n\nOne notable feature of this development lies in the fact that Bain was\none of the principal exponents and defenders of\n\u201cassociationism\u201d, whose origins, arguably, are to be found\nmost clearly in Hume's Treatise. Associationism is the\napplication of empirical observation to the relation between ideas and\nexperiences. What it seeks is observed regularities, in the hope of\nformulating psychological laws that will enable us to order the\ncontents of mind. Two such principles\u2014Contiguity and\nSimilarity\u2014were widely accepted, and identified by Bain as being\nemployed by Reid and Hamilton. A third\u2014Contrast\u2014was more\ndisputable, and in \u201cAssociationist Controversies\u201d Bain is\nprincipally concerned with the nature and identifiable independence of\nprinciples such as these.\n\nHowever, in the present context his arguments are chiefly interesting\nnot so much for their elaboration of associationism, as for the light\nthey throw on the development of Scottish philosophy in the nineteenth\ncentury. One point in particular seems to me illuminating. In the\ndispute between Reid and Hume with respect to the operations of the\nmind one of the fundamental points of difference is this. Reid is\ntrying, in the main, to establish basic principles of the mind's\noperation which will vindicate its rationality, and hence avoid the\ndepths of skepticism into which Hume's account forces it. Hume, on the\ncontrary, declares that \u201creason is nothing but a wonderful and\nunintelligible instinct in our souls which carries us along a certain\ntrain of ideas\u2026[and that this] habit is nothing but one of the\nprinciples of nature, and derives all its force from that\norigin\u201d (Hume 1888, 179), Reid's purpose is precisely to show\nthat the basic operations of the mind are more than psychological\nregularities. They are exercises of intelligibility. Now in terms of\nthis difference, Bain is of Hume's persuasion. This is revealed not\nmerely in his striking deployment of decidedly Humean terminology\nwhen, for instance, he contrasts the perception and the memory of a\nthing in terms of \u201cvividness\u201d (Bain 1903, 42). It is even\nmore evident when he asserts that \u201cThe flow of representations\nin dreaming and madness offers the best field of observation for the\nstudy of associations as such\u201d (ibid., 45).\n\nWhat this remark reveals is that Bain is interested first in\nestablishing empirical laws with respect to the contents of the human\nmind. The reason that he thinks dreaming and madness are the best\nplaces to start is precisely because he sees that the pursuit of\nrational principles, that is to say, philosophically coherent\nprinciples, is likely to distort our observation by inclining us to\nsee rational connections rather than empirical associations, or as he\nputs it \u201cassociations as such\u201d. In this respect he is\nemploying Hume's rather than Reid's conception of human nature.\nCertainly he reserves judgement on the final outcome of these\ninvestigations with respect to philosophy, arguing only for the\npriority of psychology over metaphysics and not, as Hume may be said\nto do, for the elimination of the second by the first. But so far as\nthe science of mind that had been such a marked feature of Scottish\nphilosophy goes, Bain clearsightedly pursues its more empirical\nambitions.\n\nFor Ferrier the empirical laws of association that Bain seeks are not\n\u201ctruths in philosophy\u201d. No one can be called a philosopher\nwho merely knows and says, that in dreaming or madness this mental\nrepresentation tends to be associated with that. The philosopher\naspires, rather, to make sense of experience, and the whole point\nabout the experience of the dreamer or the madman is that no sense is\nto be made of it. By contrast, the empirical psychologist, seriously\ncommitted to the experimental method, does not, in the end, render\nconsciousness intelligible; he or she simply describes how the mind\nworks.\n\nWith Ferrier and Bain, then, the tension within Scottish philosophy\nthat Davie has identified is resolved in radically different ways, the\nfirst by a return to metaphysics, the second by an advance to\npsychology. Both can claim to be inheritors of the Scottish tradition,\nand yet both, in quite different ways, may be said to have implied its\ndemise. With Bain, the nature of the demise is evident; the philosophy\nof mind is replaced by empirical psychology. With Ferrier, the nature\nof the demise is rather different. Faced with the prospect of\nreturning to Berkeleyan metaphysics, several prominent Scottish\nphilosophers preferred to look elsewhere, namely to Germany and Hegel.\nThe result was that as the century ended a group of philosophers based\nchiefly in the Universities of Glasgow and St Andrews and known as the\nScottish Idealists came to prominence.\n",
