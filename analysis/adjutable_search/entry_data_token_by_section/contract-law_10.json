    "main_text": "Philosophical Themes in the Law of Contracts || Intentionality\n2.4 Distributive fairness and the ethics of surplus sharing\n\nContract law raises questions of distributive fairness. Should the\ndesign of legal doctrine be sensitive to its distributive effects?\nShould parties consider distributive fairness in fixing the contents\nof particular agreements? The individual and institutional questions\nare of course related. Interpersonal obligations arising out of\ncontract\u2019s internal normative structure might serve as a basis\nfor institutional design.\n\nBeginning with legal doctrine, we can distinguish rules that seem more\nconcerned with procedural aspects of justice, especially freedom and\nautonomy in the lead up to agreement, than justice in the final\ndistribution of benefits and burdens. Any number of\ndoctrines\u2014fraud, duress, and undue influence, for\nexample\u2014protect weaker parties from being deceived, coerced, or\nmanipulated into contractual obligations (see\n \u00a72.2).\n Moreover, the duty of good faith in performance, one of the few\nmandatory duties that the law imposes on every contract (UCC\n\u00a71-304; R2: \u00a7205), prevents one party from exploiting her\ncounterparty\u2019s strategic vulnerabilities (often incurred on\naccount of the contract itself) to \u201crecapture opportunities\nforgone at formation\u201d (Burton 1980: 387). This approach to good\nfaith is procedural insofar as it makes the contract\u2014the\nallocation of opportunities the parties opted into \u2014the measure\nof what good faith requires.\n\nHowever, a few contract law doctrines address distributive concerns\nmore directly. For a time, it looked as if the doctrine of\n\u201cunconscionability\u201d might inscribe substantive limits on\ncontractual inequality into consumer law, at least with respect to\nlow-income consumers (UCC: \u00a72-302). The doctrine of\nunconscionability has two components: \u201cprocedural\nunconscionability\u201d arises when one side exploits inequalities of\nbargaining sophistication or power to its advantage; and\n\u201csubstantive unconscionability\u201d arises when the terms\nstruck unreasonably, and extremely, favor one side. Traditionally,\nboth elements must be separately demonstrated to establish\nunconscionability, but for a brief period, it looked as if substantive\nunconscionability, standing alone, might allow a consumer to avoid an\nonerous contractual obligation (see, e.g., Jones v. Star Credit\nCorp., 1969). This line of doctrine was quickly narrowed (see,\ne.g., Patterson v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co., Inc., 1971).\nToday, unconscionability requires (to varying degrees in different\njurisdictions) a procedural element, so that a contract\u2019s\nsubstantive injustice is not, without more, sufficient to render it\nunenforceable. Moreover, on the conventional interpretation, the\nprocedural element requires some sort of bargaining abuse so that it\nis not enough that one contracting party is less economically\nprivileged and therefore more economically vulnerable. Other doctrines\nthat subject contractual terms to distributive scrutiny similarly\nemphasize procedural and transactional aspects of justice. The\ndoctrine of contra proferentum, for example, calls for\ncontracts to be interpreted against their drafters. And any number of\nprovisions in the UCC authorize courts to fill contractual gaps,\ninterpret ambiguous terms, or regulate renegotiation, with courts\noften exercising their discretion in ways that favor unsophisticated\n(and often poorer) parties (Rakoff 2016). For this reason, although\nthe application of doctrines like unconscionability might be driven by\nconsiderations of distributive justice, the law does not make\ndistributive justice a freestanding criterion for the enforceability\nof contracts. An argument might be made that the law embodies an\nAristotelian conception of commutative justice (Gordley\n1991), so that contractual exchange must deploy a \u201cjust\nprice,\u201d which allows neither party to enrich itself at the\nexpense of the other; but an analogous claim that the law exemplifies\na general concern for social and income inequality would be hard to\nmaintain.\n\nSeveral theorists have favored broadening the egalitarian doctrines of\ncontract law. On one proposal, forms of advantage-taking in\ncontractual exchange through non-disclosure of information should be\ntolerated only to the extent that permissive rules confer long-term\nbenefits on those who are most vulnerable (Kronman 1980). The proposal\ndraws support from a prioritarian principle of weighted beneficence,\naccording to which benefits to the worse off have greater moral\nweight. Along similar lines, Aditi Bagchi (2014) argues that ambiguous\nterms in contracts should be interpreted in ways that promote\ndistributive justice by benefiting the economically worse off. The law\nof contracts thus becomes a tool for improving the unequal background\nconditions in which exchange occurs, conditions that undermine the\nvalidity and authenticity of people\u2019s choices, and, relatedly,\nthe moral basis for enforcing contracts in the first place (Ackerman\n1983; Kennedy 1982).\n\nContract law egalitarianism draws support from an extensive literature\nin moral and political philosophy that has questioned the legitimacy\nof exchange relations in unequal societies. John Rawls\u2019 seminal\nwork has been especially influential. Rawls (2005: 266\u2013267)\nobserves that the free market allows everyone to gain through private\nexchange, but it also allows those who are already more advantaged to\ncapture as much of the contractual surplus as they are able to, so\nthat \u201cthe invisible hand guides things in the wrong direction\n\u2026 maintaining unjustified inequalities and restrictions on fair\nopportunity.\u201d\n\n\nContract and property law, together with institutions of\ntax-and-transfer, arguably fall within the \u201cbasic\nstructure\u201d of society\u2014that is, the category of\ninstitutions that so pervasively influence people\u2019s lives as to\ndemand special justification (Murphy 1998: 260\u2013261). For Rawls,\nthe basic structure\u2019s justification depends on what parties\nwould rationally agree to ignorant of various aspects of their\nsituation, including their economic circumstances. Rawlsian\n\u201cmaximin principles\u201d prioritize the interests of those who\nare worse off. While a full analysis of Rawls\u2019 work and its\ninfluence on modern contract theory is beyond the scope of this entry,\nreaders can see related entries (on\n distributive justice\n and the\n original position)\n for more detail.\n\nRawlsians are hardly alone in questioning the legitimacy of private\nexchange in circumstances of inequality. Marx (Das Kapital,\n3:339\u201340) famously questions the alleged \u201cnatural\njustice\u201d of private exchange and the juristic treatment of\neconomic transactions \u201cas willful acts of the parties\nconcerned\u201d, viewing exchange relations in capitalist societies\nas invariably exploitative (see discussion in Arneson 1981: 205; cf.\nCohen 1995). Exploitation raises questions of meaningful consent and\ncoercion, some of which were discussed earlier (see\n \u00a72.2).\n But implicit in Marx\u2019s concept of exploitation (assuming the\nview to be less than fully skeptical of considerations of justice) is\na distinct moral notion: the failure of private exchange to ensure\nparties receive as much as they deserve based on their productive\ncontributions and sacrifices (cf. Cohen 1995: 116\u2013117; on moral\ndesert, see below).\n\nContract law egalitarianism at the institutional level confronts two\nstandard criticisms. First, it is not obvious that judges have the\nauthority or competence to promote distributive justice. A\ntax-and-benefit scheme may be a more effective means of promoting the\ninterests of the economically worse off than private law, though\nwhether this is true remains an open empirical question (Kaplow &\nShavell 1994; Lucy 2007: 352\u20136; Liscow 2021 [Other Internet\nResources]). Second, contract disputes are private affairs, and people\ndeserve protection from being singled out to bear the burdens\nassociated with the collective\u2019s moral responsibilities. Thomas\nNagel (1991: ch9) describes a division of moral labor between, on the\none hand, institutional actors responsible for the basic legal\nstructure, and, on the other, ordinary citizens acting in their\nprivate capacity. In general, persons may lead better lives if freed\nfrom the obligation to manage their exchange relations\naltruistically. The point seems consistent, however, with courts being\nobliged to enforce negative duties\u2014for instance, a duty not to\ntake advantage of the collective\u2019s failure to secure\ndistributive justice (Murphy 1998: 266; Bagchi 2014). The common\nlaw\u2019s unconscionability doctrine appears tailor-made to police\nthis kind of predation by the economically privileged of the\ndisadvantaged.\n\nWe turn from the institutional-level question to the question of what\ncontracting parties individually owe one another. Contracts generate\nsurplus from cooperation\u2014each side typically stands to benefit\nthrough exchange. How that surplus ought to be divided is not\nnecessarily settled by assuming that the parties transact from a place\nof equality. Robert Nozick\u2019s (1974) famous discussion of\n\u201cjustice in transfer\u201d provides a convenient starting point\nfor exploring the ethics of surplus sharing. Nozick suggests that\ninequalities arising out of voluntary transactions do not give rise to\na question of justice, given fair background conditions. On\nNozick\u2019s \u201cvoluntarist\u201d view, whatever sharing scheme\nis voluntarily agreed to (setting aside stealing, fraud, etc.) is\njust, or, alternatively, no question of justice is raised by a\ndivision the parties consented to (for a more detailed statement, see\nNozick 1974: 149\u2013182). There are other more qualified strains of\nvoluntarism. A \u201csufficientarian\u201d might insist that the\nconsented-to division must satisfy a minimal baseline. Sterba (1986:\n8) articulates a \u201cNeeds and Agreement Principle\u201d under\nwhich the results of voluntary agreement and private appropriation are\nmorally justified only insofar as each person is guaranteed the goods\nnecessary to meet the normal costs of satisfying her basic needs.\nSufficientarian constraints might entail, for example, that those\ninvolved in the provision of essential goods or services\u2014basic\nmedicine or education\u2014owe more robust duties to those with whom\nthey contract.\n\nMoving further away from pure voluntarism, a prominent approach\ndistinguishes between deserved and undeserved shares of cooperative\nsurplus. Nozick is sometimes criticized for assuming that persons are\nentitled to that portion of the market price for their goods and\nservices characterizable as \u201cscarcity rent\u201d (B. Fried\n1995: 230). Rent is defined as a gain that exceeds what is necessary\nto incentivize cooperative exchange. Excess gains in market exchange\nare often attributable to natural scarcity, including scarcity of\nnatural talents. Whether persons deserve such windfalls flowing from\nbrute luck in the birth lottery remains a deeply contested moral\nquestion. Some find a desert-basis in effort and other forms of\npersonal sacrifice, including delayed gratification (as in investment\ncontracts). On this view, parties are owed at least as much of the\nsurplus from a cooperative scheme as would constitute fair\ncompensation for their sacrifices (Reiman 1983; Sadurski 1985; Milne\n1986). Others finds a desert-basis in productive contribution. Parties\nto contractual exchange deserve fair remuneration for their marginal\nproduct (D. Miller 1976; Miller 1999; J. Riley 1989). Marginal product\nis defined as a factor\u2019s distinctive contribution to raising the\nvalue of goods and services, holding other factors constant. The\ncentral moral intuition, here, is that people ought to receive\nbenefits from exchange in proportion to how much they improve the\nwellbeing of others (Lamont 1994). The productive contribution theory\nis sometimes motivated on general consequentialist grounds (rather\nthan notions of moral desert), with rents explained as the premium\nnecessary for incentivizing parties to put their talents to productive\nand wellbeing-maximizing use (Arnold 1987).\n\nBoth the effort and productive contribution theories rely on concepts\nthat invite further specification. Consider the concept of marginal\nproduct. What is produced by one\u2019s efforts depends on the\nproductivity of the tools and raw materials one has at one\u2019s\ndisposal. The state is a contributing participant, also, in every\ncooperative exchange (B. Fried 1995). Given that many people make\ninterdependent contributions to social product, the link between any\nindividual\u2019s labor and output seems too attenuated to ground\nanything more determinate than the claim that people deserve\nsomething based on what they produce (Scanlon 2018: ch8). And\nit is hard to see how so general a normative claim could bear the\nweight of justifying any precise proposal for surplus division.\n\nGauthier (1986: 140\u2013141, 152\u2013153) suggests that\ncooperative surplus might be split according to the ratio of the\nparties\u2019 \u201cindividual relative benefit from\ncooperation\u201d. Each party\u2019s relative benefit from exchange\nis measured by their next best option. If A and B\ngenerate $10 of cooperative surplus, and A could have earned\n$3 acting independently of B, while B could have\nearned $4, then the maximum A can claim of the surplus is $6\nconsistent with inducing B\u2019s willing cooperation, and\nthe maximum B can claim is $7 for a parallel reason. When the\n$10 surplus is split based on a 6:7 ratio, each party receives such\nbenefits as she would expect apart from cooperation and, in addition,\nreceives a share of the surplus proportionate to her potential for\nbenefiting from the exchange. Gauthier defends the proposal as a\nsolution to a bargaining problem confronting self-interested rational\nagents, but it is morally contestable. It remains unclear why a party\nshould receive more just because they had a better alternative, since\nthe availability of an attractive alternative may be a function of\nbrute luck. Moreover, Gauthier\u2019s principle does not guarantee\nthat parties receive a share commensurate to sacrifice or productive\ncontribution (Van Parijs 1996).\n\nThe proposals considered so far invoke considerations of\npre-institutional morality and/or rationality. But the ethics of\nsurplus sharing might instead be traced to established customs.\nMacneil (1986) suggests that markets give rise to complex norms of\n\u201cgift-giving\u201d in commercial exchange. These gift-giving\nnorms encourage agents to refrain from claiming as much of the surplus\nas possible and have an important role to play in maintaining social\nbonds, especially in contexts where constant haggling undermines trust\nand creates impediments to contracting. For example, sellers of\nantiques will offer discounts to those who reveal their enthusiastic\ninterest in purchasing an item. By rewarding disclosures against\nself-interest, the sellers promote solidarity and cooperation in the\nmarket for antiques. Macneil observes that norms of gift-giving are\nmore likely to emerge where the cooperative surplus is large and\nrepeat interaction generates high interdependence.\n\nA question facing the social solidarity view is why market\nparticipants should feel obliged to comply with customary norms.\nCustom is sometimes portrayed \u201cas the embodiment of what parties\nin the relevant community actually, not fictitiously, consent to when\nthey manifest their intention to be legally bound\u201d (Barnett\n1992: 1192).\n\n\nOn this view, the parties\u2019 expectations become the grounds for\ncomplying with the relevant surplus sharing norms, although\nexpectations, even ones based on longstanding customs, are not always\nreasonable or fair. Another possibility is that the reasons for\ncompliance may be grounded in general, consequentialist considerations\nconcerning the importance of reinforcing socially beneficial customs.\nA third is that compliance produces additional surplus by lowering\ntransaction costs.\n\nIn the final analysis, a broad range of distributive considerations\narguably ought to shape bargaining behavior, and the above discussion\nis not intended to be exhaustive. As should be apparent from the lack\nof convergence among theorists, the moral question of justice in\ntransfer that is at the heart of contract remains far from\nsettled.\n",
