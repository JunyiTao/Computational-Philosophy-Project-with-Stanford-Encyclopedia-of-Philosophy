    "main_text": "Regular Cardinals || The Parallel Case for CH\n5.3 Assessment\nAssuming that the conjecture holds the case of CH parallels that of\n\u00acCH, only now\n\u03a322 takes\nthe place of the theory of H(\u03c92): Under the\nbackground assumptions we have: \n   there are A such that ZFC + A is\n\u03a9-complete for H(\u03c92) \nfor every such A the\nassociated TA contains \u00acCH, and \nthere is\na TA which is maximal,\nnamely, T(\u2217) and this theory contains\n2\u21350 = \u21352.\n\n\n  there are\n\u03a322-axioms A\nsuch that ZFC + A is \u03a9-complete for\n\u03a322 \nfor every such A the\nassociated TA contains CH, and \nthere is\na TA which is maximal.\n\n\n\n The two situations are parallel with regard to maximality but in\nterms of the level of \u03a9-completeness the first is stronger. For\nin the first case we are not just getting \u03a9-completeness with\nregard to the \u03a02 theory of H(\u03c92) (with\nthe additional predicates), rather we are getting \u03a9-completeness\nwith regard to all of H(\u03c92). This is\narguably an argument in favour of the case for \u00acCH, even granting\nthe conjecture. \n But there is a stronger point. There is evidence coming from inner\nmodel theory (which we shall discuss in the next section) to the\neffect that the conjecture is in fact false. Should this\nturn out to be the case it would break the parallel, strengthening the\ncase for \u00acCH. \n However, one might counter this as follows: The higher degree of\n\u03a9-completeness in the case for \u00acCH is really illusory since\nit is an artifact of the fact that under (\u2217) the theory of\nH(\u03c92) is in fact mutually interpretable with that of\nH(\u03c91) (by a deep result of Woodin). Moreover, this\nlatter fact is in conflict with the spirit of the Transcendence\nPrinciples discussed in Section 4.3. Those principles were invoked in\nan argument to the effect that CH does not have an answer. Thus, when\nall the dust settles the real import of Woodin's work on CH (so\nthe argument goes) is not that CH is false but rather that CH\nvery likely has an answer. \n It seems fair to say that at this stage the status of the local\napproaches to resolving CH is somewhat unsettled. For this reason, in\nthe remainder of this entry we shall focus on global approaches to\nsettling CH. We shall very briefly discuss two such\napproaches\u2014the approach via inner model theory and the approach\nvia quasi-large cardinal axioms. \n6. The Ultimate Inner Model\nInner model theory aims to produce \u201cL-like\u201d\nmodels that contain large cardinal axioms. For each large cardinal\naxiom \u03a6 that has been reached by inner model theory, one has an\naxiom of the form V = L\u03a6. This axiom has the\nvirtue that (just as in the simplest case of V = L) it provides an\n\u201ceffectively complete\u201d solution regarding questions\nabout L\u03a6 (which, by assumption,\nis V). Unfortunately, it turns out that the axiom V\n= L\u03a6 is incompatible with stronger\nlarge cardinal axioms \u03a6'. For this reason, axioms of this form\nhave never been considered as plausible candidates for new\naxioms. \n But recent developments in inner model theory (due to Woodin) show\nthat everything changes at the level of a supercompact cardinal. These\ndevelopments show that if there is an inner model N which\n\u201cinherits\u201d a supercompact cardinal from V (in the\nmanner in which one would expect, given the trajectory of inner model\ntheory), then there are two remarkable consequences: First, N\nis close to V (in, for example, the sense that for sufficiently\nlarge singular cardinals \u03bb, N correctly computes\n\u03bb+). Second, N inherits all known large\ncardinals that exist in V. Thus, in contrast to the inner\nmodels that have been developed thus far, an inner model at the level\nof a supercompact would provide one with an axiom that\ncould not be refuted by stronger large cardinal\nassumptions. \n The issue, of course, is whether one can have an\n\u201cL-like\u201d model (one that yields an\n\u201ceffectively complete\u201d axiom) at this level. There is\nreason to believe that one can. There is now a candidate\nmodel L\u03a9 that yields an axiom V\n= L\u03a9 with the following features: First, V\n= L\u03a9 is \u201ceffectively complete.\u201d\nSecond, V = L\u03a9 is compatible with all large\ncardinal axioms. Thus, on this scenario, the ultimate theory would be\nthe (open-ended) theory ZFC + V = L\u03a9 + LCA,\nwhere LCA is a schema standing for \u201clarge cardinal\naxioms.\u201d The large cardinal axioms will catch instances of\nG\u00f6delian independence and the axiom V\n= L\u03a9 will capture the remaining instances of\nindependence. This theory would imply CH and settle the remaining\nundecided statements. Independence would cease to be an issue. \n It turns out, however, that there are other candidate axioms that\nshare these features, and so the spectre of pluralism reappears. For\nexample, there are axioms V\n= L\u03a9S\nand V\n= L\u03a9(\u2217). These\naxioms would also be \u201ceffectively complete\u201d and compatible\nwith all large cardinal axioms. Yet they would resolve various\nquestions differently than the axiom V\n= L\u03a9. For example, the axiom, V\n= L\u03a9(\u2217)\nwould imply \u00acCH. How, then, is one to adjudicate between\nthem? \nFurther Reading: For an introduction to inner model\ntheory see Mitchell (2010) and Steel (2010). For more on the recent\ndevelopments at the level of one supercompact and beyond see Woodin\n(2010). \n7. The Structure Theory of L(V\u03bb+1)\nThis brings us to the second global approach, one that promises to\nselect the correct axiom from among V = L\u03a9, V\n= L\u03a9S,\nV\n= L\u03a9(\u2217),\nand their variants. This approach is based on the remarkable analogy\nbetween the structure theory of L(\u211d) under the assumption of\nADL(\u211d) and the structure theory of\nL(V\u03bb+1) under the assumption that there is an\nelementary embedding from L(V\u03bb+1) into itself\nwith critical point below \u03bb. This embedding assumption\nis the strongest large cardinal axiom that appears in the\nliterature. \n The analogy between L(\u211d) and\nL(V\u03bb+1) is based on the observation that\nL(\u211d) is simply L(V\u03c9+1). Thus, \u03bb\nis the analogue of \u03c9, \u03bb+ is the analogue of\n\u03c91, and so on. As an example of the parallel between\nthe structure theory of L(\u211d) under ADL(\u211d) and\nthe structure theory of L(V\u03bb+1) under the\nembedding axiom, let us mention that in the first case,\n\u03c91 is a measurable cardinal in L(\u211d) and, in the\nsecond case, the analogue of \u03c91\u2014namely,\n\u03bb+\u2014is a measurable cardinal in\nL(V\u03bb+1). This result is due to Woodin and is\njust one instance from among many examples of the parallel that are\ncontained in his work. \n Now, we have a great deal of information about the structure\ntheory of L(\u211d) under ADL(\u211d). Indeed, as we\nnoted above, this axiom is \u201ceffectively complete\u201d with\nregard to questions about L(\u211d). In contrast, the embedding axiom\non its own is not sufficient to imply that\nL(V\u03bb+1) has a structure theory that fully\nparallels that of L(\u211d) under ADL(\u211d). However,\nthe existence of an already rich parallel is evidence that the\nparallel extends, and we can supplement the embedding axiom by adding\nsome key components. When one does so, something remarkable happens:\nthe supplementary axioms become forcing fragile. This means\nthat they have the potential to erase independence and provide\nnon-trivial information about V\u03bb+1. For\nexample, these supplementary axioms might settle CH and much\nmore. \n The difficulty in investigating the possibilities for the\nstructure theory of L(V\u03bb+1) is that we have\nnot had the proper lenses through which to view it. The trouble is\nthat the model L(V\u03bb+1) contains a large piece\nof the universe\u2014namely,\nL(V\u03bb+1)\u2014and the theory of this\nstructure is radically underdetermined. The results discussed above\nprovide us with the proper lenses. For one can examine the structure\ntheory of L(V\u03bb+1) in the context of ultimate\ninner models\nlike L\u03a9, L\u03a9S, L\u03a9(\u2217),\nand their variants. The point is that these models can accommodate the\nembedding axiom and, within each, one will be able to compute the\nstructure theory of L(V\u03bb+1). \n This provides a means to select the correct axiom from among V\n= L\u03a9, V\n= L\u03a9S,\nV\n= L\u03a9(\u2217),\nand their variants. One simply looks at the\nL(V\u03bb+1) of each model (where the embedding\naxiom holds) and checks to see which has the true analogue of the\nstructure theory of L(\u211d) under the assumption of\nADL(\u211d). It is already known that certain pieces of\nthe structure theory cannot hold\nin L\u03a9. But it is open whether they can hold\nin L\u03a9S. \n Let us consider one such (very optimistic) scenario: The true\nanalogue of the structure theory of L(\u211d) under\nADL(\u211d) holds of the\nL(V\u03bb+1)\nof L\u03a9S\nbut not of any of its variants. Moreover, this structure theory is\n\u201ceffectively complete\u201d for the theory\nof V\u03bb+1. Assuming that there is a proper\nclass of \u03bb where the embedding axiom holds, this gives an\n\u201ceffectively complete\u201d theory of V. And,\nremarkably, part of that theory is that V must\nbe L\u03a9S. This\n(admittedly very optimistic) scenario would constitute a very strong\ncase for axioms that resolve all of the undecided statements. \n One should not place too much weight on this particular\nscenario. It is just one of many. The point is that we are now in a\nposition to write down a list of definite questions with the following\nfeatures: First, the questions on this list will have\nanswers\u2014independence is not an issue. Second, if the answers\nconverge then one will have strong evidence for new axioms settling\nthe undecided statements (and hence non-pluralism about the universe\nof sets); while if the answers oscillate, one will have evidence that\nthese statements are \u201cabsolutely undecidable\u201d and this\nwill strengthen the case for pluralism. In this way the questions of\n\u201cabsolute undecidability\u201d and pluralism are given\nmathematical traction. \nFurther Reading: For more on the structure theory of\nL(V\u03bb+1) and the parallel with determinacy see\nWoodin (2011b). \n",
