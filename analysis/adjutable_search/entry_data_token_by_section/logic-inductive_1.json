    "main_text": "Inductive Logic and Inductive Probabilities\n2. Inductive Logic and Inductive Probabilities\n\nPerhaps the oldest and best understood way of representing partial\nbelief, uncertain inference, and inductive support is in terms\nof probability and the equivalent\nnotion odds. Mathematicians have studied probability for over\n350 years, but the concept is certainly much older. In recent times a\nnumber of other, related representations of partial belief and\nuncertain inference have emerged. Some of these approaches have found\nuseful application in computer based artificial intelligence systems\nthat perform inductive inferences in expert domains such as medical\ndiagnosis. Nevertheless, probabilistic representations have\npredominated in such application domains. So, in this article we will\nfocus exclusively on probabilistic representations of inductive\nsupport. A brief comparative description of some of the most prominent\nalternative representations of uncertainty and support-strength can be\nfound in the supplement\n Some Prominent Approaches to the Representation of Uncertain Inference.\n",
