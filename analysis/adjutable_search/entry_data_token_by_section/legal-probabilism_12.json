    "main_text": "Bayesian Networks for Legal Applications || Bayesian networks to the rescue\n3.1 Bayesian networks to the rescue\n\nThe idea that Bayesian networks can be used for probabilistic\nreasoning in legal fact-finding started gaining traction in late\neighties (Friedman 1986) and early nineties (Edwards 1991). Two\nrecent books on the topic with an emphasis on legal applications are\nFenton and Neil 2013 [2018] and Taroni et al. 2014. A Bayesian\nnetwork comprises two components: first, a directed acyclic graph of\nrelations of dependence (represented by arrows) between variables\n(represented by nodes); second, conditional probability tables.\nConsider the graphical component first. The graph is acyclic because\nthe arrows connecting the nodes do not form loops. As an illustration,\nlet \\(H\\) be the claim that the suspect committed the murder,\nBT the presence of a blood type B match with a crime scene\nstain, and \\(W\\) the fact that an eyewitness observed the suspect near\nthe scene around the time of the crime. The graphical component of the\nBayesian network would look like this:\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nThe ancestors of a node \\(X\\) are all those nodes from which\nwe can reach \\(X\\) by following the arrows going forwards. The\nparents of a node \\(X\\) are those for which we can do this in\none step. The descendants of \\(X\\) are all which can be\nreached from \\(X\\) by following the arrows going forward. The\nchildren are those for which we can do this in one step. In\nthe example, \\(H\\) is the parent (and ancestor) of both \\(W\\) and\nBT, which are its children (and descendants). There are no\nnon-parent ancestors or non-children descendants.\n\nThe variables, which are represented by nodes and are connected by\narrows, stand in relation of probabilistic dependence. To describe\nthese relations, the graphical model is accompanied by conditional\nprobability tables. For parentless nodes such as \\(H\\), the tables\nspecify the prior probabilities of all their possible states. Assuming\n\\(H\\) stands for a binary random variable, with two possible states,\nthe prior probabilities could be:\n\nTable 3\n\n\n\nPrior  \n\n\n\\(H=\\text{murderer}\\)\n.01 \n\n\\(H=\\text{not.murderer}\\)\n.99  \n\n\nThe .01 figure for \\(H=\\text{murderer}\\) rests on the assumption that,\nabsent any incriminating evidence, the defendant is unlikely to be\nguilty. For children nodes, the tables specify their conditional\nprobability given combinations of their parents\u2019 states. If the\nvariables are binary, an assignment of values for them could be:\n\nTable 4\n\n\n\n\\(H=\\text{murderer}\\)\n\\(H=\\text{not.murderer}\\)  \n\n\n\\(W=\\text{seen}\\)\n.7\n.4 \n\n\\(W=\\text{not.seen}\\)\n.3\n.6  \n\n\nTable 5\n\n\n\n\\(H=\\text{murderer}\\)\n\\(H=\\text{not.murderer}\\)  \n\n\n\\(\\BT=\\text{match}\\)\n1\n.063 \n\n\\(\\BT=\\text{no.match}\\)\n0\n.937  \n\n\nAccording to the tables above, even if the defendant is not the\nculprit, the eyewitness testimony would still incriminate him with\nprobability of .4, while the blood evidence with probability equal to\nonly .063. The blood type frequency estimate is realistic (Lucy 2013:\n141), and so are the conditional probabilities for the eyewitness\nidentification. As expected, eyewitness testimony is assumed to be\nless trustworthy than blood match evidence (but for complications\nabout assessing eyewitness testimony, see Wixted and Wells 2017;\nUrbaniak et al. 2020).\n\nThe three probability tables above are all that is needed to define\nthe probability distribution. The tables do not specify probabilistic\ndependencies between nodes that are not in a relation of child/parent,\nsuch as BT and \\(W\\). Since there is no arrow between them,\nnodes BT and \\(W\\) are assumed to be independent conditional\non \\(H\\), that is, \\(\\Pr(W \\pmid H)=\\Pr(W \\pmid H \\wedge \\BT)\\). This\nfact represents, as part of the structure of the network, the\nindependence between eyewitness testimony and blood evidence. A\ngeneralization of this fact is the so-called Markov condition (see the\ntextbook by Neapolitan [2004] and the\n supplement on Bayesian networks\n of the entry on\n artificial intelligence.)\n\nWhile the Bayesian network above\u2014comprising a directed acyclic\ngraph along with probability tables\u2014is simple, a correct\nintuitive assessment of the probability of the hypothesis given the\nevidence is already challenging. Try to guess the probability that the\ndefendant committed the murder (\\(H=\\text{murderer}\\)) given the\nfollowing states of the evidence:\n\n\n\nThe suspect\u2019s blood type matches the crime stain but information\nabout the witness is unavailable.\n\n\nThe suspect\u2019s blood type matches the crime stain but the witness\nsays they did not see the suspect near the crime scene.\n\n\nThe suspect\u2019s blood type matches the crime stain and the witness\nsays they saw the suspect near the crime scene.\n\n\nAlready at this level of complexity, calculations by hand become\ncumbersome. In contrast, software for Bayesian networks (see, for\nexample, the \\(\\textsf{R}\\) package \\(\\textsf{bnlearn}\\) developed by\nMarco Scutari and described in Scutari and Denis 2015) will easily\ngive the following results:\n\nTable 6\n\n\n\n\\(H=\\text{murderer}\\)  \n\n\n\\(\\BT=\\text{match},W=?\\)\n.138 \n\n\\(\\BT=\\text{match},W=\\text{not.seen}\\)\n.074 \n\n\\(\\BT=\\text{match},\nW=\\text{seen}\\)\n.219  \n\n\nPerhaps surprisingly the posterior probability of \\(H\\) = murderer is about .22\neven when both pieces of evidence are incriminating\n(\\(\\BT=\\text{match}, W=\\text{seen}\\)).\n",
