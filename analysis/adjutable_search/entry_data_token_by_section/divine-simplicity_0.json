    "main_text": "Motivation\n1. Motivation\n\nWhat could motivate such a strange and seemingly incoherent doctrine?\nOne central consideration in its favor derives from the Anselmian\ndefinition of God as maximally perfect, as that than which no greater\ncan be conceived. A God who was less than maximally perfect would not\nbe an absolute reality and an appropriate object of worship. A God who\nwas less than ultimate and absolute would be an idol. Now an absolute\nreality must be a se, from itself, and so not dependent on\nanything distinct from itself either for its nature or for its\nexistence. If God had properties in the way creatures have them,\nhowever, he would be distinct from them and so dependent on them. This\nis the case whether one thinks of a property of x as a\nconstituent of x, or as an entity external to x to\nwhich x is tied by the asymmetrical relation (or\nnonrelational tie) of instantiation. If the properties of x\nare constituents or ontological (proper) parts of x, then\nx will depend on them in the same way that any whole composed\nof parts depends on its parts. But if x is tied to its\nproperties by the asymmetrical relation of instantiation, it is still\nthe case that x will depend on them: if x is\nF in virtue of x\u2019s instantiation of\nF-ness, then F-ness is a logically prior condition\nof x\u2019s being F. In sum, the divine aseity\nwould seem to require that God be rather than have\nhis attributes.\n\nOne can also arrive at the simplicity doctrine via the divine\nnecessity. As maximally perfect, as that than which no greater can be\nconceived, God must be a metaphysically necessary being, one that\ncannot not exist. A necessary being is one whose possibility entails\nits existence, and whose nonexistence entails its impossibility. But\nwhat could be the ground of this necessity of existence if not the\nidentity in God of essence and existence, possibility and actuality?\nSaying that God exists in all metaphysically possible worlds does not\nprovide a ground, but merely a graphic Leibnizian representation, of\nthe notion of necessary being. The possible worlds representation also\ndoes not distinguish the necessity of God from that of an abstract\nobject such as the set of even primes. God is not just another\nnecessary being among necessary beings; he is uniquely necessary as\nthe source and ground of everything distinct from himself, including\nall non-divine necessary beings. Indeed, God is uniquely unique, i.e.,\nunique in his mode of uniqueness, in that he is not one of a kind, or\nnecessarily one of a kind, but unique in transcending the\nkind-instance difference altogether. A divine being cannot possess\ncontingent modal status: if God exists, then he is necessary, and if\nhe does not exist, then he is impossible. So if God exists, then there\nis a very tight connection between the divine nature and the divine\nexistence. The simplicity doctrine in its traditional and strongest\nform assays this \u2018tightness\u2019 as identity. The divine\nsimplicity thus grounds the divine necessity. God is necessary because\nhe is simple. It is easy to see that the divine simplicity also\ngrounds God\u2019s possession of essential properties. God has his\nattributes essentially because he is identical to his attributes.\nNothing is more essential to a thing than something to which it is\nidentical.\n\nA third motivation for DDS lies in the fact that it provides a\nsolution to the ancient Euthyphro dilemma first presented by Plato in\nhis eponymous dialog. Does God command the good because it is good,\nand forbid the bad because it is bad, or is the good good and the bad\nbad because God commands/forbids it? If the former, God\u2019s\nwilling would be subject to an external standard logically antecedent\nto God to the detriment of the divine sovereignty. If the latter, the\ncontent of morality would be arbitrary because subject to God\u2019s\nfree will. On DDS, however, the dilemma is a false alternative. If God\nis goodness itself in its prime instance, then he is not subject to a\nstandard; he is the standard. And if God, being simple, just is his\nwilling, then he cannot will anything other than the good and the\nappearance of arbitrarity vanishes. See Feser (2009, 129) who draws on\nStump (2003).\n\nNote that while the traditional approach to divine simplicity is in\nterms of identity, this approach is open to what Dolezal (2011,\n136\u2013144) calls the \u201charmonist challenge\u201d according\nto which, on one variation, that of Immink (1987), the divine\nattributes are not identical but necessarily equivalent. Dolezal also\ncounts Swinburne (1994) among the harmonists. Harmonism will not be\ndiscussed further in this entry. See Dolezal (2011) for competent\ncritique of harmonism and for an overall excellent defense of DDS.\n\nBesides perfection and necessity, immateriality, eternity, and\nimmutability also seem to point to simplicity as their ground. Because\nGod is simple, he cannot have parts and so cannot have material or\ntemporal parts. And because God is simple, he cannot harbor any\nunrealized potentialities, and so must be immutable. The centrality of\nDDS to medieval philosophical theology is shown by its position in the\norder of topics in Aquinas\u2019 Summa Theologica. It occurs\nas Question 3 right after Question 2 on the existence of God.\n\nFinally, the triune nature of the God of classical Christian theism\nmay also be taken as motivating DDS within Christian theology, and\nthis despite the initial suspicion that Trinity is incompatible with\ndivine simplicity. According to Wedgeworth (2019, 62),\n\u201cAthanasius of Alexandria consistently used the doctrine of\ndivine simplicity to argue that the Son\u2019s eternal Generation\nfrom the Father proved his absolute deity \u2026.\u201d To pursue\nthis further lies beyond the scope of this entry.\n",
