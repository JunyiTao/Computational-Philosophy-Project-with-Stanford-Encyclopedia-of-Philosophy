All of this was\nhanded to him. He did not surround himself with governesses and\nwealth. He did not make himself. And yet he is to be compelled to pay\n(Darrow 1924: 65).\n\nLet\u2019s turn now to arguments for incompatibilism based on the\nidea that a free and responsible action is an action that is caused\nand controlled by its agent in a special \u201cthe buck stops\nhere\u201d way, a way that is incompatible with deterministic\nevent-causation.\n\nThe most popular instance of this kind of argument is an argument that\nwe will call \u201cthe desperate defense attorney\u2019s\nargument\u201d (Darrow 1924). The defense attorney\u2019s argument\nis simple:\n\nMy client is responsible for his crime only if he \u201cmade\nhimself\u201d\u2014that is, only if he caused himself to be\nthe kind of person he is.\nMy client did not make himself.\nTherefore my client is not responsible for his crime.\n\n\nThe defense attorney is trying to persuade the jurors that his client\nis not responsible for his action, but not for any of the standard\nexcusing conditions\u2014insanity, accident, mistaken belief, duress,\nmental handicap, and so on. Nor does he claim that there is anything\nthat distinguishes his client from any of the rest of us. His argument\nis that his client is not responsible because he did not make himself.\nBut none of us has made ourselves (at least not from scratch)\u2014we\nare all the products of heredity and environment. So if we accept the\ndefense attorney\u2019s argument, it appears that we are committed to\nthe conclusion that no one is ever responsible for\nanything.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that this is an argument for incompatibilism.\nIt\u2019s an argument for incompatibilism only if it\u2019s an\nargument for hard determinism\u2014that is, if it\u2019s an argument\nfor the thesis that determinism is true and because of\nthis we are never responsible for anything. Let\u2019s take a\ncloser look.\n\nWhat\u2019s the argument for premise (2)? After all, we do make our\nselves, at least in the garden-variety way in which we make other\nthings: we plant gardens, cook dinners, build boats, write books and,\nover the course of our lives, re-invent, re-create, and otherwise\n\u201cmake something of ourselves\u201d. Of course we don\u2019t do\nany of these things \u201cfrom scratch\u201d, without help from\nanyone or anything else, but it\u2019s impossible (or at least\nimpossible for human beings) to make anything from scratch. The truth\nor falsity of determinism has no bearing on this point.\n\n(See G. Strawson 1986 and 1994 for an argument for the\nimpossibility of \u201ctrue responsibility\u201d that is a\nmore sophisticated version of the defense attorney\u2019s argument.\nSee also Smilansky 2000. See Mele 1995 and Clarke 2005 for a critique\nof Strawson\u2019s argument.)\n\nIf we pressed our defense attorney (or brought in a philosopher to\nhelp him out), we might get the following reply: The kind of\ngarden-variety self-making possible at a deterministic world is not\ngood enough for the kind of moral responsibility required for deserved\nblame and punishment. Granted, we can never have complete\ncontrol over the actions we perform because of our\nchoices (Nagel 1979), and this limits the control we have\nover our self-making. But we are morally responsible for our\nactions only if we have at least some control over our\nself-making, and we have control over our self-making only if we have\ncontrol over the choices that are the causes of the actions whereby we\nmake our selves. And we have control over these choices only if we\ncause our choices and no one and nothing causes us to make them\n(Chisholm 1964).\n\nThe defense attorney (or philosopher) is defending premise (2) by\narguing for a certain interpretation of premise (1)\u2014that our\nresponsibility for our actions requires that we have \u201cmade\nourselves\u201d in the sense that, over the course of our lives, we\nhave frequently been the first cause of the choices that\nresult in actions and thus eventually (albeit often in ways we can\nneither predict nor control) to changes in our selves. In arguing this\nway, he has shifted the focus of the argument from the obviously\nimpossible demand that the freedom required for moral responsibility\nrequires entirely self-made selves to the intuitively\nappealing and at least not obviously impossible demand that the\nfreedom required for moral responsibility requires what Robert Kane\nhas called \u201cultimate responsibility\u201d (that we are the\nultimate sources or first causes of at least some of our\nchoices\u2014those choices that are the causes of \u201cself-forming\nactions\u201d). (See Kane 1996, 1999, 2008, 2011a. See also Chisholm\n1964; Clarke 1993, 1996, 2003; O\u2019Connor 1995a, 2000, 2011;\nPereboom 2001, 2009b, 2014; Steward 2012).\n\nThis brings us to the philosopher\u2019s version of the defense\nattorney\u2019s argument. (For variations on this kind of argument,\nsee Kane 1996, 1999, 2008, 2011a and Pereboom 2001, 2005, 2014.)\n\nWe act freely (in the way necessary for moral responsibility) only\nif we are the ultimate sources (originators, first causes) of\nat least some of our choices.\nIf determinism is true, then everything we do is ultimately caused\nby events and circumstances outside our control.\nIf everything we do is ultimately caused by events and\ncircumstances outside our control, then we are not the\nultimate sources (originators, first causes) of any of our\nchoices.\nTherefore, if determinism is true, we are not the ultimate sources\nof any of our choices.\nTherefore, if determinism is true, we never act freely and we are\nnever morally responsible.\n\n\nPremise (2) follows from the definition of determinism (at least given\ntwo widely accepted assumptions: that there is causation in a\ndeterministic universe and that causation is a transitive relation).\n(For some doubts about the latter assumption, see Hall 2000.) Premise\n(3) is clearly true. So if we want to reject the conclusion, we must\nreject Premise (1).\n\nCompatibilists have argued against (1) in two different ways. On the\npositive side, they have argued that we can give a satisfactory\naccount of the (admittedly elusive) notion of self-determination\nwithout insisting that self-determination requires us to be the first\ncauses of our choices (Frankfurt 1971, 1988; Watson 1975, 1987, 2004;\nDennett 1984; Wolf 1990; Fischer 1994; Fischer & Ravizza 1998; Bok\n1998; Nelkin 2011; Sartorio 2016). On the negative side,\ncompatibilists have challenged (1) by arguing that it is of no help to\nthe incompatibilist: if we accept (1), we are committed to the\nconclusion that free will and moral responsibility are\nimpossible, regardless of whether determinism is true or\nfalse.\n\nThe challenge to (1) takes the form of a dilemma: Either determinism\nis true or it\u2019s not. If determinism is true, then my choices are\nultimately caused by events and conditions outside my control, so I am\nnot their first cause and therefore, if we accept (1), I am neither\nfree nor responsible. If determinism is false, then something that\nhappens inside me (something that I call \u201cmy choice\u201d or\n\u201cmy decision\u201d) might be the first event in a\ncausal chain leading to a sequence of body movements that I call\n\u201cmy action\u201d. But since this event has no sufficient cause,\nwhether or not it happens is not under my control any more\nthan the spinning of a roulette wheel inside my brain is under my\ncontrol. Therefore, if determinism is false, I am not the\nfirst cause or ultimate source of my choices and, if we accept (1), I\nam neither free nor responsible (Ayer 1954; Wolf 1990).\n\nIn order to defend (1) against the \u201cdetermined or random\u201d\ndilemma, above, the incompatibilist has to offer a positive account of\nthe puzzling claim that persons are the first causes of their\nchoices. The traditional incompatibilist answer is that this claim\nmust be taken literally, at face value. We\u2014agents, persons,\nenduring things\u2014are causes with a very special property: we\ninitiate causal chains, but nothing and no one causes us to do this.\nLike God, we are uncaused causers, or first movers. If Joe\ndeliberately throws a rock, which breaks a window, then the\nwindow\u2019s breaking (an event) was caused by Joe\u2019s throwing\nthe rock (another event), which was caused by Joe\u2019s choice\n(another event). But Joe\u2019s choice was not caused by any further\nevent, not even the event of Joe\u2019s thinking it might be fun to\nthrow the rock; it was caused by Joe himself. And since Joe\nis not an event, he is not the kind of thing which can be caused. (Or\nso it is argued, by agent-causalists. See Chisholm 1964;\nO\u2019Connor 1995a, 2000, 2011; Pereboom 2001.)\n\nMany philosophers think that agent-causation is either incoherent or\nimpossible, due to considerations about causation. What sense does it\nmake to say that a person, as opposed to a change in a\nperson, or the state of a person at a time, is a cause? (Bok\n1998). (See also Clarke 2003 for a detailed and sympathetic\nexamination of the metaphysics of agent-causation, which ends with the\nconclusion that there are, on balance, reasons to think that\nagent-causation is impossible.)\n\nOthers (van Inwagen 2000; Mele 2006) have argued that even if\nagent-causation is possible, it would not solve the problem of\ntransforming an undetermined event into one which is in our\ncontrol in the way that our free choices must be. And others have\nargued that if agent-causation is possible, it is possible at\ndeterministic as well as non-deterministic worlds (Markosian 1999;\nNelkin 2011; Franklin 2016).\n\nSome incompatibilists have responded to the \u201cdetermined or\nrandom\u201d dilemma in a different way: by appealing to the idea of\nprobabilistic causation (Kane 1996, 1999, 2008, 2011a). If our choices\nare events which have probabilistic causes (e.g., our beliefs,\ndesires, and other reasons for acting), then it no longer seems\nplausible to say that we have no control over them. We make\nchoices for reasons, and our reasons cause our choices, albeit\nindeterministically. Kane\u2019s reply may go some way towards\navoiding the second (no control) horn of the dilemma. But it\ndoesn\u2019t avoid the first horn. If our choices are caused by our\nreasons, then our choices are not the first causes of our actions. And\nour reasons are presumably caused, either deterministically or\nprobabilistically, so they are not the first causes of our actions\neither. But then our actions are ultimately caused by earlier events\nover which we have no control and we are not the ultimate sources of\nour actions.\n",
