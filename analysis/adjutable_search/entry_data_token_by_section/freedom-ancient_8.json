    "main_text": "Voluntary Action, Moral Responsibility, and What is \u201cUp to Us\u201d || Epicurus on reason, character formation, and what \u201cdepends on us\u201d\n2.3 Epicurus on reason, character formation, and what \u201cdepends on us\u201d\n\nLike Aristotle, Epicurus believes that our ability to shape the\ndevelopment of our character is central to our being responsible for\nour actions, and that we have this ability because of our reason.\nFurthermore, the person who argues that our actions do not depend on\nus refutes themself in the very act of arguing for their thesis.\n\nThe Epicureans think that all of our actions are explained by our desire\nfor pleasure, our aversion to pain, and our beliefs about how best to\nobtain pleasure and avoid pain (Ep. Men 128, Fin.\n1.23, 1.30 1.46). People engage in wrongdoing because they have\nincorrect beliefs about what will bring them pleasure (KD 7,\n10, SV 16, Fin. 1.32\u201333, 1.55). If a person wrongly\nbelieves that pursuing great wealth will make them happy, then they\nwill pursue wealth. But this psychological hedonism does not render us\nhelpless, because our beliefs are under our control, and it is reason\nwhich gives us this control over our beliefs. We can learn to\ndistinguish which of our desires are for things we really need, and\nwhich desires cause us harm, and thereby reject the harmful desires\n(KD 18\u201322, 29\u201330). Using our reason, we can overcome hate,\nenvy, contempt, and other emotions that might lead us to wrongdoing\n(DL 10.117).\n\nThis reasons-responsiveness is what distinguishes us from other\nanimals and allows us to control our own development, while other\nanimals cannot. Other animals have in-born temperaments: for instance,\nlions are naturally irascible because their minds contain many fire\natoms, while stags are timid because they have more wind atoms\n(DRN 3.288\u2013306). People also have natural temperaments: some\nare easily moved to anger, while others are too fearful (DRN\n3.307\u2013318). But we can use our reason to expel any harmful\ndispositions, so that only trivial traces of these temperaments\nremain, and we are able to achieve a life worthy of the gods\n(DRN 3.319\u2013322).\n\nIn book 25 of his treatise On Nature (LS 20B\u2013C), Epicurus\nalso asserts that how we develop depends on us, and then he tries to\nshow that it is self-refuting to maintain that all things occur of\nnecessity. Unfortunately, while this is an important text for\nunderstanding Epicurus, it is also extremely unclear. Epicurus has a\ncontorted and jargon-ridden writing style, and the text as we have it\nis full of gaps, because it is preserved on charred scrolls from an\nEpicurean villa buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE. So\nthe summary of his arguments below, like any summary of this text, is\nbound to be controversial, and it is considerably more clear than\nEpicurus\u2019 own arguments.\n\nEpicurus says some people have disordered congenital dispositions,\ne.g., they are naturally hotheaded due to their atomic make-up. But\nunlike wild animals, we blame a person who develops badly and remains\na hothead as an adult, because the way we actually develop depends on\nus, and not on the nature of our atoms. We each have\n\u201cseeds\u201d, psychological potentials to develop one way or\nthe other, and which \u201cseeds\u201d develop depend on us and on\nbeliefs of our own making. Further evidence for our control over\nourselves, says Epicurus, is that we rebuke, oppose, and reform each\nother as if the responsibility for what we do lies also \u201cin\nourselves\u201d, not just in our congenital dispositions and in our\nenvironment. If somebody argues against this thesis and maintains that\neverything we do is necessitated, he refutes himself. That is because\nin his action of engaging in debate, the person is assuming that he is\nresponsible for reasoning correctly and that his opponent is\nresponsible for talking nonsense.\n\nAt first blush, this self-refutation argument appears quite\nunpromising, as Epicurus\u2019 opponent has an obvious reply: they\ncan maintain that the actions of the people engaging in the debate,\nincluding their own, are necessitated, and nonetheless try to show\nthat their own position is better-supported and thereby convince their\nopponent to change their mind. Epicurus, however, thinks that this\nreply fails. We have a concept of what it means for something to be\nnecessitated, versus for something to depend on us. And the empirical\nbasis for these concepts is observing ourselves in action\u2014in\nparticular, observing our actions of rebuking, opposing, and reforming\none another. We see that we can dissuade other people from an action,\ne.g., I can talk to my friend and convince him not to give in to a\nbully\u2019s demands and to stand up to him instead. We also see that\nsometimes we decide to do things we don\u2019t feel like doing, e.g.,\nI undergo painful dental work in order to avoid greater pain in the\nfuture. From these observations, we form the distinction between\nthings that depend on us, versus ones that are necessitated, and we\nshow our understanding of this distinction in our actions, as we try\nto dissuade one another from things that \u201cdepend on us\u201d,\nwhile it would be pointless to do so for those that are necessitated.\nAccording to Epicurus, if his opponent claims that all of our actions\nare necessitated, and they do not challenge the empirical basis of our\ndistinction, they are merely \u201cchanging a name\u201d. To show\nthat our actions are necessitated in a substantial way, the opponent\nwould have to show how we are mistaken when we think that we can use\nour reason to persuade one another to act differently, that we can\ndecide to undergo short-term pain for the sake of long-term gain, and\nthe like. But the action of trying to persuade somebody to change\ntheir mind, by giving them reasons to think that their current\nconviction is mistaken, is precisely the sort of thing that forms the\nbasis for the conceptions that Epicurus\u2019 opponent is trying to\nchallenge (see Castagnoli 2010: 145\u2013159 for more on this\nargument).\n",
