    "main_text": "The Concept of Progress || Progress, Quality, Impact\n2.3 Progress, Quality, Impact\n\nFor many goal-directed activities it is important to distinguish\nbetween quality and progress. Quality is primarily\nan activity-oriented concept, concerning the skill and competence in\nthe performance of some task. Progress is a result-oriented concept,\nconcerning the success of a product relative to some goal. All\nacceptable work in science has to fulfill certain standards of\nquality. But it seems that there are no necessary connections between\nquality and progress in science. Sometimes very well-qualified\nresearch projects fail to produce important new results, while less\ncompetent but more lucky works lead to success. Nevertheless, the\nskillful use of the methods of science will make progress highly\nprobable. Hence, the best practical strategy in promoting scientific\nprogress is to support high-quality research. \n\nFollowing the pioneering work of Derek de Solla Price (1963) in\n\u201cscientometrics,\u201d quantitative science indicators\nhave been proposed as measures of scientific activity (Elkana et\nal. 1978). For example, output measures like publication\ncounts are measures of scholarly achievement, but it is\nproblematic whether such a crude measure is sufficient to indicate\nquality (cf. Chotkowski La Follette 1982). The number of articles in\nrefereed journals is an indicator of the quality of their author, but\nit is clear that this indicator cannot yet define what progress means,\nsince publications may contribute different amounts to the advance of\nscientific knowledge. \u201cRousseau\u2019s Law\u201d proposed by\nNicholas Rescher (1978) marks off a certain part (the square root) of\nthe total number of publications as \u201cimportant\u201d, but this\nis merely an alleged statistical regularity.\n\nAnother example of a science indicator, citation index, is an\nindicator for the \u201cimpact\u201d of a publication and for the\n\u201cvisibility\u201d of its author within the scientific\ncommunity. Martin and Irvine (1983) suggest that the concept of\nscientific progress should be linked to the notion of impact,\ni.e., the actual influence of research to the surrounding scientific\nactivities at a given time. It is no doubt correct that one cannot\nadvance scientific knowledge without influencing the epistemic state\nof the scientific community. But the impact of a publication as such\nonly shows that it has successfully \u201cmoved\u201d the scientific\ncommunity in some direction. If science is goal-directed, then we must\nacknowledge that movement in the wrong direction does not\nconstitute progress.\n\nThe failure of science indicators to function as definitions of\nscientific progress is due to the fact that they do not take into\naccount the semantic content of scientific publications. To\ndetermine whether a work \\(W\\) gives a contribution to scientific\nprogress, we have to specify what \\(W\\) says (alternatively: what\nproblems \\(W\\) solves) and then relate this content of \\(W\\) to the\nknowledge situation of the scientific community at the time of the\npublication of \\(W\\). For the same reason, research assessment\nexercises may use science indicators as tools, but ultimately they\nhave to rely on the judgment of peers who have substantial knowledge\nin the field.\n",
