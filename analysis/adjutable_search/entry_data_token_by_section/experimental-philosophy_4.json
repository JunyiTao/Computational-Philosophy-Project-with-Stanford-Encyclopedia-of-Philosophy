    "main_text": "Research in Experimental Philosophy || Impact of Moral Judgment\n2.3 Impact of Moral Judgment\n\nIt is common to distinguish between two kinds of judgments that people\nmake about morally significant situations. On one hand, people can\nmake straightforwardly moral judgments (e.g., judgments about\nmoral wrongness, about obligation, about blameworthiness). On the\nother, they can make judgments that might be morally relevant but that\nstill appear to be in some important sense non-moral\njudgments (about whether the agent acted intentionally, whether\nshe caused certain outcomes, whether she knew what she was doing). A\nquestion now arises as to how to understand the relationship between\nthese two different kinds of judgments.\n\nOne possible view would be that the relationship is entirely\nunidirectional. Thus, it might be thought that (a) people\u2019s\nmoral judgments depend on prior non-moral judgments, but (b)\npeople\u2019s non-moral judgments do not depend on prior\nmoral judgments. We can illustrate this view with the example of the\nrelationship between people\u2019s moral judgments and their\nintentional action judgments. It seems clear that people\u2019s moral\njudgments about whether an agent is deserving of blame might depend on\nprior non-moral judgments about whether this agent acted\nintentionally. However, one might think that things do not go in the\nopposite direction. It is not as though your non-moral judgment that\nthe agent acted intentionally could depend on a prior moral judgment\nthat her action was wrong.\n\nAlthough this view might seem intuitively compelling, a series of\nstudies in experimental philosophy have called it into question. These\nstudies suggest that people\u2019s moral judgments can impact their\njudgments even about what might appear to be entirely non-moral\nquestions. Such results have been obtained for a wide variety of\ndifferent apparently non-moral judgments. \n\n When an agent knows that she will bring about an outcome but is\nnot specifically trying to bring it about, people are more inclined to\nsay that she brought it about intentionally when it is\nmorally bad than when it is morally good (Knobe 2003).\n When an agent correctly believes that an outcome will arise but\nis only correct in this belief as the result of a coincidence, people\nare more inclined to say that she has knowledge when the\noutcome is morally bad than when it is morally good (Beebe & Shea\n2013; Buckwalter 2014).\n When an agent has a lot of positive emotion and a high opinion of\nher life, people are less inclined to say that she is truly\nhappy when her life is morally bad than when it is morally\ngood (Phillips, Nyholm & Liao 2014).\n When a number of different factors are each individually\nnecessary for an outcome to arise, people are more inclined to regard\none of the factors as a cause when it is morally bad than\nwhen it is morally good (Alicke 1992; Hitchcock & Knobe\n2009).\n\n\nEffects of moral judgment have also been observed on numerous other\njudgments, including everything from action individuation (Ulatowski,\n2012) to attributions of weakness of will (May & Holton 2012) to\nthe semantics of gradable adjectives (Egr\u00e9 & Cova\n2015).\n\nThese findings might be philosophically relevant at two different\nlevels. On one hand, each individual effect might be relevant to\nphilosophical work that aims to understand the corresponding concept\nor property. Thus, the findings about intentional action judgments\nmight be relevant to philosophical work about intentional action,\nthose about happiness judgments might be relevant to philosophical\nwork about happiness, and so forth. At the same time, the general\nfinding that moral judgment has this pervasive influence might be\nrelevant to philosophical work that focuses on the human mind and the\nway people make sense of the world. For example, these findings could\nhelp us to understand the nature of folk psychology or the\nrelationship between our ordinary folk theories and more systematic\nscientific theories.\n\nTo make progress on these two issues, research has focused on trying\nto understand why these effects arise. That is, researchers have aimed\nto provide hypotheses about the precise cognitive processes that give\nrise to the patterns observed in people\u2019s judgments. These\nhypotheses then, in turn, have implications for philosophical\nquestions both about specific concepts and properties and about the\nhuman mind.\n\nExisting research has led to a proliferation of hypotheses, drawing on\ntheoretical frameworks from a variety of fields (see Cova 2016 for a\nreview of seventeen hypotheses about the intentional action effect).\nStill, although there are numerous distinct specific hypotheses, it\nseems that the basic approaches can be grouped into four broad\nfamilies.\n\nFirst, it might be that the effect is not truly driven by moral\njudgment. Existing studies show that people make different\njudgments depending on whether the agent is doing something helpful or\nharmful, but of course, there are many differences between helpful and\nharmful actions other than their moral status. For example, a number\nof researchers have argued that the effect is in fact driven by\npeople\u2019s beliefs about the mental states of the agents in the\nvignettes (Sloman, Fernbach & Ewing 2012; Sripada & Konrath\n2011). Agents will tend to have different sorts of mental states when\nthey are doing something helpful than when they are doing something\nharmful, and it might be that this difference in mental states is\ndriving all of the observed effects.\n\nSecond, it might be that the effect is indeed driven by moral judgment\nbut that it is the result of an error. On this view, moral\nconsiderations do not play any real role in the concepts at work here\n(people\u2019s concepts of intentional action, of happiness, etc.).\nRather, people\u2019s judgments are being biased or distorted by some\nfurther process which gets in the way of their ability to correctly\napply their own concepts. For example, some researchers have argued\nthat the effect is due to a process of motivated cognition (Alicke,\nRose & Bloom 2011). People believe the agent to be blameworthy and\nwant to justify that belief. This desire to justify blame then\ndistorts their judgments about what might seem to be purely factual\nmatters.\n\nThird, it might be that the effect is driven by moral judgment and\ndoesn\u2019t involve an error but nonetheless simply reflects a\nfact about how people use words, rather than a fact about their\napplication of the corresponding concepts. Researchers often make\ninferences from facts about how people use certain words\n(\u2018intentionally,\u2019 \u2018happy,\u2019\n\u2018knows\u2019) about how people apply the corresponding concepts\n(the concept of intentional action, of happiness, of knowledge).\nHowever, it is also possible for factors to influence the use of our\nwords without influencing the use of these concepts, and some\nresearchers have suggested that this is the process at work in the\npresent effects. For example, it has been suggested that these effects\narise as a result of conversational pragmatics, with people trying to\navoid the pragmatic implicatures that would be generated by making\ncertain claims that are in fact literally true (Adams & Steadman\n2004). Alternatively, it has been suggested that the relevant words\n(e.g., \u2018intentionally\u2019) are actually associated with more\nthan one different concept and that the impact of morality arises not\nbecause morality plays a role in any of these concepts but rather\nbecause it plays a role in the way people resolve the ambiguity of the\nword itself (Nichols & Ulatowski 2007). On these sorts of views,\npeople are not necessarily making a mistake when their use of language\nis impacted by moral judgment, but all the same, moral judgment is not\nplaying a role in their more basic capacities to make sense of the\nworld.\n\nFourth, it might be that moral judgment actually plays a role in\npeople\u2019s basic capacities to apply the relevant concepts.\nFor example, it has been argued that the concept of happiness is\nitself a value-laden concept (Phillips et al. 2014). Similarly, it has\nbeen suggested the concepts of intentional action and causation make\nuse of a form of counterfactual thinking in which moral judgments play\na key role (Icard, Kominsky & Knobe 2017; Phillips, Luguri &\nKnobe 2015). On this last view, the effects observed in these\nexperiments point to a genuine role for moral judgment in the most\nbasic capacities underlying people\u2019s application of the relevant\nconcepts.\n\nDebates between these rival views remain ongoing. Within the more\nrecent literature, discussion of these questions has become\nincreasingly interdisciplinary, with many of the key contributions\nturning to methods from cognitive neuroscience, developmental\npsychology, or computational cognitive science.\n",
