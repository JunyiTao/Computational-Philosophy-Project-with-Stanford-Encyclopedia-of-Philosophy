    "main_text": "Underdetermination || Underdetermination in Cosmology\n2.1 Underdetermination in Cosmology\n\nGiven the grand scope of cosmology, one might expect that many\nquestions must remain unresolved. Basic features of the SM impose two\nfundamental limits to the ambitions of cosmological theorizing. First,\nthe finitude of the speed of light ensures that we have a limited\nobservational window on the universe due to existence of the visual\nhorizon, representing the most distant matter from which we can\nreceive and information by electromagnetic radiation, and the particle\nhorizon, representing the most distant matter with which we can have\nhad any causal interaction (matter up to that distance can influence\nwhat we see at the visual horizon). Recent work has precisely\ncharacterized what can be established via idealized astronomical\nobservations, regarding spacetime geometry within, or outside, our\npast light cone (the observationally accessible region). Second, in\naddition to enormous extrapolations of well-tested physics in the SM,\ncosmologists have explored speculative ideas in physics that can only\nbe tested through their implications for cosmology; the energies\ninvolved are too high to be tested by any accelerator on Earth. Ellis\n(2007) has characterized these speculative aspects of cosmology as\nfalling on the far side of a \u201cphysics horizon\u201d. We will\nbriefly discuss how this second type of horizon poses limits for\ncosmological theorizing. In both cases, the type of underdetermination\nthat arises differs from that discussed in the philosophical\nliterature.\n",
