    "main_text": "Leibniz and Wolff: Perfection and Truth\n1. Leibniz and Wolff: Perfection and Truth\n\n\nThe traditional idea that art is a special vehicle for the expression\nof important truths is the basis for the work of the philosopher who\nestablished the framework for German thought for much of the\n18th century, namely, Christian Wolff\n(1679\u20131754). Wolff never devoted a whole work to aesthetics, but\nmany of the ideas that would influence subsequent aesthetic theory are\ncontained in his Rational Thoughts on God, the World, and the Soul\nof Man, his \u201cGerman Metaphysics,\u201d first published in\n1719.\n\n\nOriginally appointed to teach mathematics at the Pietist-dominated\nuniversity of Halle, Wolff was inspired by both the mathematical and\nphilosophical genius of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716),\nbut published a vast systematic statement of a philosophy that was\nconstructed partly although by no means wholly on Leibnizian lines in\na way that Leibniz himself never did. Wolff\u2019s collected works (over\nthirty volumes in German and forty in Latin) include German versions\nof his logic, metaphysics, ethics, political philosophy, and teleology\nas well as a four-volume encyclopedia of mathematical subjects. In\naddition, there are expanded Latin versions of the logic, the\ncomponents of metaphysics including ontology, rational cosmology,\nempirical psychology, rational psychology, and natural psychology, as\nwell as another four-volume mathematical compendium, seven volumes on\nethics, and no fewer than twelve volumes on political philosophy and\neconomics. In all of this vast output, the only thing that might look\nlike a work specifically in aesthetics is a treatise on architecture\nincluded in his encyclopedia of mathematics. That very placement\nindicates that Wolff regarded the discussion of architecture as part\nof the theory of science; and in the Preliminary Discourse on\nPhilosophy in General that prefaces his Latin restatement of his\nsystem, Wolff states more generally that a \u201cphilosophy of the\narts\u201d is possible, but as part of \u201ctechnics or\ntechnology,\u201d \u201cthe science of the arts and of the works of\nart\u201d (Wolff, Preliminary Discourse, \u00a771,\np. 38). Here Wolff uses the term \u201cart\u201d (ars) in\nthe ancient sense of techne, which means any form of craft\nrequiring both aptitude and training, rather than in the specifically\nmodern sense of \u201cfine art.\u201d In his German works, Wolff\nuses the word Kunst in the same broad way. Even with regard\nto something closer to the fine arts, however, he says that\n\u201cThere could also be a philosophy of the liberal arts, if they\nwere reduced to the form of a science\u2026.one might talk about\nrhetorical philosophy, poetical philosophy, etc.\u201d (ibid.,\n\u00a772, p. 39). Wolff certainly does not have the idea of the fine\narts as a domain of human production and response that differs in some\nessential way from all other forms of human production and response,\nthus he does not have the idea of aesthetics as a discipline that will\nfocus on what distinguishes the fine arts and our response to them\nfrom everything else.  Nevertheless, in the course of his works he\nintroduces some ideas about both the fine arts and our response to\nthem that will be seminal for the next half-century of German\nthought.\n",
