    "main_text": "Requirements of Structural Rationality || Process vs. State Requirements\n2.3 Process vs. State Requirements\n\nWhile most authors take requirements of structural rationality to\ngovern attitude-states, such as beliefs or intentions, some have\nargued that they should rather be understood as requirements on\nprocesses, such as reasoning or, more generally, the forming,\ndropping or retaining of attitudes (Kolodny 2005,\n2007b; Podgorski 2017). Since processes are temporally extended, all\nprocess requirements are diachronic. What is less often recognized is\nthat the reverse is not true: diachronic requirements need not be\nprocess-requirements, since they can govern states at\ndifferent points in time (Podgorski 2017). Thus, the\nsynchronic/diachronic debate is distinct from the process/state\ndebate.\n\nIn support of the process-oriented view, Kolodny (2005) holds that\nrequirements can be response-guiding and potentially normative\n(\u00a72.2) only if they govern processes rather than states. He also\nargues that state-requirements are redundant once all plausible\nprocess requirements have been specified. Critics of the\nprocess-oriented view have responded by drawing an analogy to\nreasons for belief and other attitudes, which can be\nresponse-guiding and normative even though they are for states rather\nthan processes, and have challenged Kolodny\u2019s redundancy claim\n(Kiesewetter 2017: 73\u201379).\n\nWhile it is very controversial whether all instances of structural\nirrationality can be explained in terms of process requirements, it is\nless controversial that there are process requirements that\ncannot be reduced to state requirements. For example, what seems\nirrational about wishful thinking is not necessarily the belief or the\nwish, or the combination of these states, or their occurrence in a\ncertain chronological order, but specifically the process\nthrough which the belief was formed. More generally, it seems\nplausible that there are basing prohibitions (Broome 2013)\n\u2013 rational requirements not to base certain attitudes\non others \u2013 which cannot be reduced to state-requirements.\n",
