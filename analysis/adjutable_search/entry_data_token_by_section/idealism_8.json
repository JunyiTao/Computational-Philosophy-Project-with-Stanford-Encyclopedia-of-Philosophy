    "main_text": "British and American Idealism\n9. The Fate of Idealism in the Twentieth Century\n\nBoth epistemological and ontological idealism came under massive\nattack in Britain at the turn of the twentieth century by George\nEdward Moore (1873\u20131958) and Bertrand Russell (1872\u20131970),\nwhile in the United States Royce\u2019s position was attacked by a\nschool of younger \u201cNew Realists\u201d, to some extent inspired\nby his life-long interlocutor William James, who included E.B. Holt\nand his younger Harvard colleague Ralph Barton Perry, and later Roy\nWood Sellars (the father of Wilfrid Sellars, who later moved back to a\nform of Kantianism), and Arthur Lovejoy. Both Moore and Russell had\nmore of an enduring influence on the course of analytic philosophy\nthan did the American New Realists, but also reveal the continuing\nimpulse to idealism in spite of their own efforts, so we will focus on\nthem. Both of them take idealism to be spiritualism in the spirit of\nBerkeley and Bradley (neither of them mentions their own Cambridge\ntutor McTaggart!), i.e., they think of idealism as a position\ncharacterized by the claim that the universe (Moore) or whatever\nexists or whatever can be known to exist (Russell) is spiritual\n(Moore) or in some sense mental (Russell). Although their attack was\nso influential that even more than a hundred years later, any\nacknowledgment of idealistic tendencies is viewed in the\nEnglish-speaking world with reservation, it is by no means obvious\nthat they actually thought they had disproved idealism. On the\ncontrary, neither Moore nor Russell claimed to have demonstrated that\nthe universe or what exists or can be known to exist is not spiritual\nor mental. All that they take themselves to have shown is that there\nare no good philosophical (in contradistinction to, e.g., theological\nor psychological) arguments available to support such a claim. Moore\nespecially is very explicit about this point. He devotes the first\nfive pages of his famous piece from 1903, \u201cThe Refutation of\nIdealism\u201d, to assuring the reader over and over that\n\n\nI do not suppose that anything I shall say has the smallest tendency\nto prove that reality is not spiritual. \u2026 Reality may be\nspiritual, for all I know; and I devoutly hope it is. \u2026 It is,\ntherefore, only with idealistic arguments that I am\nconcerned; \u2026 I shall have proved that Idealists have no\nreason whatever for their conclusion. (Philosophical\nStudies, pp. 2 f.)\n\n\nAnd Russell in his The Problems of Philosophy (1912), in a\nsimilar vein, warns the reader, after emphasizing the strangeness of\nan idealistic position from a common sense point of view:\n\n\n[I]f there were good reasons to regard them [viz. physical objects] as\nmental, we could not legitimately reject this opinion merely because\nit strikes us as strange. (1912 [1974: 38])\n\n\nMoore and Russell found two main arguments for idealism to be\nfallacious. The first concerns Berkeley\u2019s idealistic principle\nthat being consists in being perceived, the second the converse claim,\nattributed to Bradley, that thought entails being. Their criticism of\nthe first as well as their rebuttal of the second argument stems from\ncertain convictions they share as to the nature of knowledge. The\nassault on Berkeley is staged by Moore most extensively in \u201cThe\nRefutation of Idealism\u201d (1903). Here he holds that if there is\nan argument to prove the idealistic claim that the universe is\nspiritual (1903: 433) then this reasoning must rely either at the\nbeginning or at some point later in the argument on the premise\nesse est percipi: \n\n\nI believe that every argument ever used to show that reality is\nspiritual has inferred this (validly or invalidly) from\n\u201cesse is percipere\u201d as one of its\npremisses; and that this again has never been pretended to be proved\nexcept by use of the premiss that esse is percipi.\n(1903: 437) \n\n\nAccording to Moore the proposition esse is percipi\n\u201cdoes at least assert that whatever is, is\nexperienced\u201d (1903: 437) which is meant in turn to\nassert \n\n\nthat wherever you have x [esse] you also have\npercipi; that whatever has the property x also has\nthe property that it is experienced. (1903: 440) \n\n\nAfter a lengthy analysis of this proposition he points out that the\nconception of the connection between an experience and what is\nexperienced that the idealist is entertaining has tenuous consequences\nthat give rise to the question: \n\n\nif we never experience anything but what is not an inseparable aspect\nof that experience, how can we infer that anything whatever,\nlet alone everything is an inseparable aspect of any\nexperience? (1903: 451) \n\n\nAn inference to such a conclusion cannot be justified. He concludes\nthat in order to avoid an idealistic position one is better off to\nendorse a view according to which \n\n\nI am as directly aware of the existence of material things in space as\nof my own sensations, and what I am aware of with regard to\neach is exactly the same\u2014namely that in one case the material\nthing, and in the other case my sensation does really exist (1903:\n453) \n\n\nThis line of reasoning, remarkably similar to what Kant had argued in\nthe Fourth Antinomy in the first edition of the Critique of Pure\nReason but rejected as an inadequate refutation of idealism in\nthe second edition, was picked up in an abbreviated form by Russell\nten years later in the chapter on idealism in his The Problems of\nPhilosophy, while the attack on Bradley, although foreshadowed in\nRussell\u2019s Problems, is spelled out rather lengthily\n(and a bit nastily) by Moore in \u201cThe Conception of\nReality\u201d from 1917\u201318. Their main objection against the\ntwo idealistic arguments seems to be that they rely on unjustly\npresupposing that the mental act of relating to an object (perceiving,\nthinking, knowing, experiencing) is a necessary condition for the\nexistence of this object. The fallacy involved here consists in\nfailing to make \u201cthe distinction between act and object in our\napprehending of things\u201d, as Russell (1912 [1974: 42]) puts it,\nor, in Moore\u2019s terminology of The Refutation, in\nwrongfully identifying the content of \u201cconsciousness\u201d with\nits object (1912 [1974: 19 ff.]). As soon as this identification is given up and that\ndistinction is made it is at least an open question whether things\nexist independently of the mind, and idealism insofar it neglects\nthis distinction and holds fast to that identification is refuted\nbecause based on an invalid argument.\n\nWhether this line of criticism of idealistic positions is indeed\nsuccessful might be controversial, and even if it strikes home against\nBerkeley the charge that they simply conflate knowledge and object\nhardly seems to do justice to the elaborate arguments of the late\nnineteenth-century idealists. However, if one is convinced of the\ncorrectness of this criticism (as no doubt Moore and Russell were)\nthen it makes way for interesting new perspectives in epistemology and\nmetaphysics. This is so because if this criticism is taken to be\nsuccessful it permits us to explore the possibility of a theory of\nknowledge that starts from the assumptions (a) that objects exist\nindependently of us and (b) that to know an object means to be\nimmediately related to the object as it is in itself (i.e., as it is\nundistorted by and independent from any mental activity). Both Moore\nand Russell can be understood to have embarked on this exploration in\nthe course of which they came to conceive a position which is aptly\ncalled by Peter Hylton \u201cPlatonic Atomism\u201d (2013: 329).\n\nThe basic idea of this Platonic atomism seems to be the following:\nKnowledge consists in standing in an immediate relation to an\nindependent individual object (assumption b). This immediate relation\nto individual objects is best known under Russell\u2019s term\n\u201cacquaintance\u201d. If, by stipulation, knowledge is\nultimately knowledge \u201cby acquaintance\u201d, then knowledge is\nrestricted to knowledge of individual objects. Knowledge basically is\nknowledge of something or non-propositional knowledge.\nHowever, although this rather frugal conception of knowledge might be\nsufficient to give an account of the possibility of non-propositional\nknowledge, it is not that easy to see how such a conception can give a\nsensible explanation of propositional knowledge, i.e., of knowledge\nthat something is so-and-so. Moore and Russell seem to have\nbeen acutely aware of this difficulty as is documented in their very\nexplicit efforts to avoid it. It might have been their different\nreactions to this difficulty which in the years to come led them to\nproceed on diverging routes in philosophy. As is easy to imagine,\nthere are two obvious reactions to the problem of propositional\nknowledge provided that assumption (b) is agreed upon. The first is to\nclaim that propositions (Moore prefers the term \u201cjudgment\u201d\nin this context) are individual objects with which the subject is\nacquainted (if he or she claims to know that something is\nso-and-so). The second is to broaden the concept of knowledge by not\nrestricting knowledge to knowledge by acquaintance but to allow for\nother forms of knowledge as well. The first reaction\napparently was the reaction of Moore and is formulated most\nprominently in his early piece \u201cThe Nature of Judgment\u201d\n(1899), while the second can be attributed to Russell and is\ndocumented most vividly in his The Problems of\nPhilosophy.\n\nAccording to Moore a proposition is composed out of concepts. If we\nare to be acquainted with propositions we have to take their elements,\ni.e., concepts, to have independent existence (because of assumption\na). Moore points out:\n\n\n\u2026 we have approached the nature of a proposition or judgment. A\nproposition is composed not of words, nor yet of thoughts, but of\nconcepts. Concepts are possible objects of thought; but that is no\ndefinition of them. It merely states that they may come into relation\nwith a thinker; and in order that they may do anything, they\nmust already be something. It is indifferent to their nature\nwhether anyone thinks them or not. They are incapable of change; and\nthe relation into which they enter with the knowing subject implies no\naction or reaction. It is a unique relation which can begin to cease\nwith a change in the subject; but the concept is neither cause nor\neffect of such a change. The occurrence of the relation has, no doubt,\nits causes and effects, but these are to be found only in the subject.\n(1899: para. 9)\n\n\nMoore is well aware that this analysis of the nature of a proposition\nleads to some version of what could be called \u201cconceptual\nrealism\u201d, according to which that what is \u201creally\u201d\nreal are concepts because they are the ultimate objects of\nacquaintance. He explicitly states:\n\n\nIt would seem, in fact, \u2026that a proposition is nothing other\nthan a complex concept. The difference between a concept and a\nproposition, in virtue of which the latter alone can be called true or\nfalse, would seem to lie merely in the simplicity of the former. A\nproposition is a synthesis of concepts; and, just as concepts are\nthemselves immutably what they are, so they stand in infinite\nrelations to one another equally immutable. A proposition is\nconstituted by any number of concepts, together with a specific\nrelation between them; and according to the nature of this relation\nthe proposition may be either true or false. What kind of relation\nmakes a proposition true, what false, cannot be further defined, but\nmust be immediately recognized (1899: para. 12)\n\n\nMoore also is very well aware that his view of the nature of concepts\ncommits him to the claim that the world insofar as it is an object\nof propositional knowledge consists of concepts because these are\nthe only things one can be acquainted with if acquaintance is a\ncondition of knowledge. Thus he writes:\n\n\nIt seems necessary, then, to regard the world as formed of concepts.\nThese are the only objects of knowledge. They cannot be regarded\nfundamentally as abstractions either from things or from ideas; since\nboth alike can, if anything is to be true of them, composed of nothing\nbut concepts. A thing becomes intelligible first when it is analyzed\ninto its constituent concepts. The material diversity of things, which\nis generally taken as starting-point, is only derived; and the\nidentity of the concept, in several different things, which appears on\nthat assumption as the problem of philosophy, will now, if it instead\nbe taken as the starting-point, render the derivation easy. Two things\nare then seen to be differentiated by the different relations in which\ntheir common concepts stand to other concepts. The opposition of\nconcepts to existents disappears, since an existent is seen to be\nnothing but a concept or complex of concepts standing in a unique\nrelation to the concept of existence. (1899: para. 16).\n\n\nMoore confesses that \u201cI am fully aware of how paradoxical this\ntheory must appear, and even how contemptible\u201d (1899: para. 14).\nAnd indeed one wonders whether such an account does not raise more\nproblems than it answers. Fortunately we do not have to be concerned\nwith this question here. However, if we ask whether Moore\u2019s\ntheory really manages to avoid idealism, it is hard not to conclude\nthat its metaphysical commitments are precisely a form of idealism,\neven if he has been led to his theory by an attempt to maintain\nepistemological realism! After all, to claim that only concepts are\nreal, that they have a mode of being outside of space and time, that\nthey are non-physical and completely unaffected by any activity of a\nthinking subject, does not sound very different from statements that\ncan rightly be attributed to, e.g., Hegel, or even ultimately Plato,\nand that are meant to assert idealism. The main difference in this\ncase is that Moore\u2019s conception of what a concept is has\nvirtually nothing to do with what Hegel means by\n\u201cconcept\u201d, but this does not suffice to establish\nontological anti-idealism. Although Moore might avoid identifying\nconcepts with the mental states of subjects by his insistence upon the\nmetaphysical independence of concepts, he comes dangerously close to\nthe point where the difference between ontological idealism and\nontological realism vanishes and this distinction becomes a question\nof terminology.\n\nRussell chooses a different path in the attempt to somehow reconcile\nthe idea that knowledge has to be understood as a relation of\nacquaintance with objects with the phenomenon of propositional\nknowledge. He is more flexible both with respect to kinds of knowledge\nand with respect to kinds of objects with which we can be acquainted\nthan Moore is. First of all, he distinguishes between knowledge of\nthings and knowledge of truths. He recognizes two kinds of knowledge\nof things: knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description.\nKnowledge by acquaintance obtains whenever\n\n\nwe have acquaintance with anything of which we are directly\naware, without the intermediary of any process of inference or any\nknowledge of truths. (1912 [1974: 46])\n\n\nKnowledge by (definite) description obtains\n\n\nwhen we know that it [i.e., the object] is \u201cthe\nso-and-so\u201d, i.e., when we know that there is one object, and no\nmore, having a certain property. (1912 [1974: 53])\n\n\nThe relation between these two kinds of knowledge is the\nfollowing:\n\n\n[K]nowledge concerning what is known by description is ultimately\nreducible to knowledge concerning what is known by acquaintance. (1912\n[1974: 58])\n\n\nKnowledge of truths is distinguished from these two kinds of\nknowledge of things. Knowledge of truths consists in pieces\nof knowledge that although they cannot be proven by experience are\nsuch that we nevertheless \u201csee\u201d their truth (1912 [1974:\n74]). Examples of truths that can be known this way are logical\nprinciples, the principle of induction, and everything we know a\npriori. This taxonomy of kinds of knowledge, Russell believes,\ncan account both for the possibility of non-propositional and\npropositional knowledge and at the same time retain the claim as to\nthe primacy of the acquaintance-relation for knowledge.\n\nThe obvious question now is: if all knowledge is ultimately based on\nacquaintance, what is it we can be acquainted with, i.e., what are the\nlegitimate objects of acquaintance? Because, according to Russell, the\nacquaintance relation is a relation to individual things this question\ntranslates into \u201cwhat are the individual things we can be\nacquainted with?\u201d Russell\u2019s answer to this question is\nthat there are exactly two kinds of things we can be acquainted with,\nnamely particulars, i.e., things that exist, and universals, i.e.,\nthings that subsist (cf. 1912 [1974: 100]). Particulars comprise\nsense-data, thoughts, feelings, desires and memories of \u201cthings\nwhich have been data either of the outer senses or of the inner\nsense\u201d (1912 [1974: 51]). Universals are\n\n\nopposed to the particular things that are given in sensation. We speak\nof whatever is given in sensation, or is of the same nature as things\ngiven in sensation, as a particular; by opposition to this, a\nuniversal will be anything which may be shared by many\nparticulars. (1912 [1974: 93])\n\n\nUniversals are conceptual entities: \u201cThese entities are such as\ncan be named by parts of speech which are not substantives; they are\nsuch entities as qualities or relations\u201d (1912 [1974: 90]).\nBecause universals and particulars alike are possible objects of\nacquaintance both have to be real. However, according to Russell they\nare real in a different sense. Particulars have existence in time\nwhereas universals have timeless being. The first ones exist, the\nother subsist. They form two different worlds in that the world of\nparticulars consists of items that are \u201cfleeting, vague, without\nsharp boundaries\u201d whereas the world of universals \u201cis\nunchangeable, rigid, exact\u201d (1912 [1974: 100]).\n\nThis rough outline of Russell\u2019s epistemic universe is meant to\nemphasize only those aspects of his position that are of relevance for\nan assessment of idealistic tendencies in his approach to knowledge.\nAs in the case of Moore it is tempting to interpret his commitment to\na timeless world of universals as pointing if not to an endorsement at\nleast to a toleration of a position that is difficult to distinguish\nfrom some version of an ontological idealism. But again one has to\nacknowledge that such a verdict is not very significant because one\ncould as well describe this position as a version of ontological\nrealism. It just depends on what is claimed to be the distinctive\nfeature of idealism. If idealism is a position characterized by taking\nfor granted the reality of conceptual entities that are not\nmind-dependent then both Moore and Russell endorse it. If idealism is\nmeant to be a position which takes conceptual items to be\nmind-dependent, that is, dependent on particular minds, then both are\nrealists with respect to concepts. However, it is hard to see how\nRussell can avoid the epistemological path to idealism given his views\nabout physical objects. This is so because of his sense-datum theory,\naccording to which what is immediately present to us, i.e., what we\nare acquainted with when we are acquainted with particulars, are just\nsense-data and not objects in the sense of individual things with\nqualities standing in relations to each other. For him \u201camong\nthe objects with which we are acquainted are not included physical\nobjects (as opposed to sense-data)\u201d (1912 [1974: 52]). Physical\nobjects are constructions we form out of sense-data together with some\ndescriptive devices, and only with respect to these constructions can\nwe have knowledge by description, i.e., propositional knowledge. If\nidealism is understood (as has been done here) as involving the claim\nthat what we take to be objects of knowledge are heavily dependent on\nsome activity of the knowing subject, then the very idea of an object\nas a construction guarantees the endorsement of idealism. Thus, in\ncontrast to their self-proclaimed revolt against the idealism of\nBerkeley and Bradley, the positions of both Moore and Russell are by\nno means free of traits that connect them rather closely to well known\ncurrents in modern idealism; and these features, above all the\nsupposition that knowers may be immediately presented with some sorts\nof informational atoms, whether properties, sense-data, or whatever,\nbut that all further knowledge, or all knowledge beyond immediate\nacquaintance, involves constructive activities of the mind, are common\nthroughout a great deal of recent philosophy.\n\nTo trace the subterranean presence of at least epistemological\nidealism throughout the remainder of twentieth-century philosophy\nwould exceed the brief for this entry. There is room here for just a\nfew hints of how such an account would go. At Oxford, some influence\nof idealism continued until World War II in the person of Robin George\nCollingwood, who was influenced by Hegel and the Italian philosopher\nBenedetto Croce but was a very original thinker. Collingwood\u2019s\nmost characteristic position might be his claim that metaphysics is\nthe study of the presuppositions of human knowledge, at various\nhistorical periods, rather than of independently existing entities;\nthus he might be considered as adopting a fundamental epistemological\npremise for idealism, although he does not seem to have drawn an\nontological conclusion from it\u2014perhaps as a practicing\narchaeologist as well as a philosopher, the physical world was just\ntoo real to him for that. In Germany, Neo-Kantianism, especially of\nthe Marburg school, from Hermann Cohen to Ernst Cassirer, thus from\nthe 1870s to the 1940s, stressed human conceptualization, in\nCassirer\u2019s case in the guise of \u201csymbolic forms\u201d,\nwhile trying to steer clear of traditional metaphysical questions;\ntheir position might thus also be considered a form of epistemological\nrather than ontological premise for but not outright acceptance of\nmetaphysical idealism. Neo-Kantianism in turn influenced the broader\nstream of analytic philosophy through the person of Rudolf Carnap,\nwhose Logical Construction of the World (1928) analyzes\nknowledge in terms of relations constructed on perceived similarities\nin qualities of objects, thus taking a subjectivist starting-point and\nthen adding constructive activities of the mind to it\u2014a form of\nepistemological idealism. Nelson Goodman\u2019s Structure of\nAppearance (1951) undertook a similar project. Subsequent to the\nLogical Construction, Carnap distinguished between questions\n\u201cinternal\u201d to a conceptual framework or system and\n\u201cexternal\u201d questions about which conceptual framework to\nadopt, which can be decided only on pragmatic or even aesthetic\ngrounds, and this too might be considered a form of epistemological\nidealism. Thomas Kuhn\u2019s famous conception of\n\u201cparadigms\u201d of science which are not automatically\nrejected because of refractory evidence but are given up only when an\nalternative paradigm comes to seem preferable can be seen as being in\nthe Carnapian tradition, as can Hilary Putnam\u2019s \u201cinternal\nrealism\u201d of the 1980s, and both these positions thus reflect\nsome of the motives for epistemological idealism. Even W.V. Quine, who\nwas a committed physicalist in the sense of believing that other\nsciences are in principle reducible to physics, nevertheless shared an\naspect of idealist epistemology in his conception of the \u201cweb of\nbelief\u201d, that is, the idea that knowledge consists in a body of\nbeliefs, from particular observation statements down to logical\nprinciples, which faces experience only as a whole and which can be\nmodified at any point within it in order to accommodate refractory\nexperience, as seems best. A similar idea was already to be found in\nCassirer\u2019s early work Substance and Function (1912),\nwhich points to the underlying impulse to epistemological idealism.\nWilfrid Sellars\u2019s conception of the \u201cspace of\nreasons\u201d, taken up in Robert Brandom\u2019s inferentialism,\nalso reflects this impulse, although Sellars always considered\nhimself, like his father, a scientific realist, and his most\nexplicitly Kantian work, Science and Metaphysics (1968),\ngives what might be regarded as a pragmatist rather than idealist spin\nto Kant\u2019s phenomena/noumena distinction, interpreting the\nnoumenal as what would be known if science were complete, an idea\nclearly inspired by Charles Sanders Peirce rather than by\nKant\u2014although not completely different in spirit from\nRoyce\u2019s idea that the error of our particular beliefs can be\nunderstood only by comparison to a body of complete and completely\ntrue beliefs, not to some independent, non-belief reality. These are\njust a few examples of how some of the most prominent paradigms, to\nborrow Kuhn\u2019s term, of analytic philosophy still reflect the\nimpulse to epistemological idealism even though the name\n\u201cidealism\u201d was anathematized by Moore, Russell, and the\nNew Realists.\n\nHowever, one mid-twentieth century philosopher who had no qualms about\nidentifying himself as an idealist was Brand Blanshard\n(1892\u20131987). The difference between Blanshard and many of the\nmid-twentieth century analytic philosophers is precisely that\nBlanshard accepted the assumption that there must be a necessary\nisomorphism between knowledge and its object, and so was not content\nto posit something real outside of the web of belief or space of\nreasons, but brought reality into the realm of thought. \n\nBlanshard was an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, then won\na Rhodes scholarship to Merton College, Oxford, where his tutor was\nH.W.B. Joseph and he also met Bradley, a lifelong research fellow at\nMerton. After earning an MA at Columbia, where he participated in a\nresearch project under John Dewey, and then World War I service in\nFrance, he completed his Oxford BA and then a PhD at Harvard under the\nsupervision of C.I. Lewis\u2014so he had a very diverse philosophical\neducation. He taught at Swarthmore College from 1925 to 1944 and at\nYale from 1944 until 1961. Remarkably, Blanshard was at different\npoints in this career in the same department as each of the\nSellarses\u2014he was an undergraduate at Michigan when Roy Wood\nSellars was a young teacher there, and was then Wilfrid\nSellars\u2019s colleague during the latter\u2019s tenure at Yale\nfrom 1958 to 1963. There are affinities between his views and theirs,\nespecially with Wilfrid Sellars\u2019s conception of\nconceptually-informed perception; but they differ decidedly on the\nissue of idealism vs. material realism. Blanshard\u2019s idealism was\nat full-strength in the two volumes of The Nature of Thought\n(1939), which was dedicated to the Oxford idealists H.H. Joachim and\nE.F. Carritt; many arguments remained the same but the inference to\nidealism was somewhat toned-down in his later trilogy, Reason and\nGoodness (1961), Reason and Analysis (1962), and\nReason and Belief (1974).\n\nThe affinity with Wilfrid Sellars lies in Book I of The Nature of\nThought, \u201cThought in Perception\u201d, in which Blanshard\nargues that we always perceive something \u201cas this rather than\nthat\u201d, thus that \u201cthe recognition of the universal and the\nplacing it in relation to other universals\u201d are always\ninseparable from perception (1939: volume I, p. 65). This recognition\nof the conceptually-infused character of perception, the position\nadopted by such Sellarsians as John McDowell (McDowell 1994) and\ncurrently known as \u201cconceptualism\u201d, does not by itself\nentail idealism. Rather, Blanshard\u2019s idealism is on display in\nVolume II, Book III of his work, \u201cThe Movement of\nReflection\u201d, where he offers his theory of truth. Here he argues\nthat coherence rather than correspondence is not only the\n\u201ctest\u201d but also the \u201cnature\u201d of truth: \n\n\nIt is hard to see \u2026 how anyone could consistently take\ncoherence as the test of truth unless he also took it as a character\nof reality. (1939: vol. II, p. 267) \n\n\nHere Blanshard evinces the premise that knowledge must be isomorphic\nwith the known that underlies many arguments for idealism. His next\nmove, the characterization of coherence as a character of reality in\nterms of systematicity, seems sufficiently abstract to remain neutral\nabout the ontology of reality. But he also argues that knowledge or\nthought must be part of a single system with its object, the\nworld, (1939: vol. II, p. 292), which, since knowledge is\nincontrovertibly mental, pushes the whole system in that direction.\nHis idealism becomes even clearer in his defense of the Bradleian\ndoctrine that all relations are internal relations, and as such\nnecessary relations, so that \n\n\nThese old sharp lines of mutual exclusion between essence, property,\nand accident are like the lines of a surveyor, of great convenience,\nno doubt, to ourselves, but misleading when taken as divisions marked\nout by nature. (1939: vol. II, p. 480) \n\n\nand when he further asserts \n\n\n(i) that all things are causally related, directly or\nindirectly; (ii) that being causally related involves being\nlogically related. (1939: vol. II, p. 492) \n\n\nThis makes sense if the character of reality is ultimately either\nconceptual or mental in nature, subject to logical relations, and not\npurely physical, subject merely to causal relations. Blanshard\u2019s\nstatement that the \u201cold sharp lines\u201d between essence and\naccident are not so sharp after all might sound like W.V.O.\nQuine\u2019s thesis that there is no sharp distinction between the\nanalytic and the synthetic (Quine 1951), but while this leads Quine to treat all our\nbeliefs as if they are synthetic, ultimately dependent upon our total\nresponse (the web of belief) to observation of external reality,\nBlanshard\u2019s position is more that all our beliefs are ultimately\nanalytic, that is, analyses of the conceptual structure of reality, or\nof reality as a conceptual structure. Blanshard concludes his lengthy\nargument with claims reminiscent of Hegel: \n\n\nThe aim of thought from its very beginning \u2026 was at\nunderstanding. The ideal of complete understanding would be achieved\nonly when this system that rendered it necessary was not a system that\nitself was fragmentary and contingent, but one that was all-inclusive\nand so organized internally that every part was linked to every other\nby intelligible necessity\u2026 . If our account of the end is\naccepted, it will be found to throw light backward alone the whole\ncourse of the inquiry. For it presents the goal which thought, from\nits first stirrings in perception, has more or less unknowingly been\nseeking, the end potential in every idea, the whole implicitly at work\nat every stage in the movement of reflection, exercising its steady\npressure against irrelevant excursions and toward the completion of\nfragmental knowledge into stable system. (1939: vol. II, p. 518) \n\n\nKnowledge must be knowledge of necessary connections, and reality\nitself must be an intrinsically intelligible system of connections or\ninternal relations. Blanshard\u2019s combination of the premise of\nthe necessary isomorphism of knowledge and the known with the doctrine\nof internal relations exemplifies both an epistemological and an\nontological argument for idealism.\n\nSince the work of Blanshard in the 1930s, very few Anglophone\nphilosophers have attempted an explicit defense of idealism. Both John\nFoster, in The Case for Idealism (1982) and Timothy Sprigge\nin The Vindication of Absolute Idealism (1983) constructed\ndefenses of what Foster defined by the three theses \n\n\n(1) Ultimate contingent reality is wholly mental. (2) Ultimate\ncontingent reality is wholly non-physical. (3) The physical world is\nthe logical product of facts about human sense-experience (Foster\n1982: 3) \n\n\nand what Sprigge called \u201cpanpsychism\u201d. In both cases their\ndefenses were based on the epistemological premise that the object of\nperception is fully present in the act of perception; Sprigge\nadded the argument that we must presuppose some noumenal ground for\nour phenomenal objects; but unlike Kant, who after he stripped things\nin themselves of their spatiality and/or temporality, insisted that we\nremain otherwise agnostic about their nature, Sprigge argued that \n\n\nthe noumenal backing or \u201cin itself\u201d of the physical by\nsaying that it consists in innumerable mutually interacting centres of\nexperience, or, what comes to the same, of pulses and flows of\nexperience. (Sprigge 1983: 85) \n\n\nIn other words, the noumenal \u201cbacking\u201d of the phenomenal\nis nothing but the sum total of actual and possible human experience,\nwhich Sprigge considers, in terms going back to Bradley, a\n\u201cconcrete universal\u201d. One could argue that this confused\nthe sum total of experience or thought about reality with reality\nitself, but Sprigge rejects that kind of distinction from the\nbeginning of his argument; basically, he holds all knowledge to be\nknowledge by acquaintance, and what we have when we subsume any\nexperience under a concept or universal is an immediate relation to\npart of a concrete universal\u2014so all of reality is itself mental\nin nature.\n\nThese arguments have remained outliers, for analytical philosophy has\nbeen overwhelmingly influenced by the paradigm of the natural\nsciences, and often committed to some form of naturalism. Or so it\nwould seem; however, as the examples of Green and Royce as well as\nearlier idealists such as Schelling make clear, there is no necessary\nincompatibility between idealism and some forms of naturalism. In\nparticular, naturalism, especially broadly understood as a methodology\nrather than ontology, is not automatically committed to the kinds of\nrealism, especially the na\u00efve realism of assuming that our\nrepresentations reproduce the physical constitution of external\nobjects, that were initially opposed to idealism. One might even get\nthe impression that in contemporary scientifically-oriented philosophy\nidealism is no longer considered a threat. The way in which in current\ndiscussions in the philosophy of mind some idealistic conceptions\nunder the general name of \u201cPanpsychism\u201d, already used by\nSprigge, are taken seriously (Thomas Nagel, David Chalmers) seems to\nbe a good indicator of this tendency.\n\nIn so-called \u201ccontinental\u201d philosophy, we might suggest,\nthe main alternative to the idealism of the nineteenth century and\nlingering tendencies to idealism in both Neo-Kantianism and Husserlian\nphenomenology has not been any straightforward form of realism, but\nrather the \u201clife philosophy\u201d (Lebensphilosophie)\npioneered by Wilhelm Dilthey (1833\u20131916), then extensively\ndeveloped by Martin Heidegger (1889\u20131976), and, without\nHeidegger\u2019s political baggage, by the French philosopher Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty (1908\u20131961). The central idea of this approach to\nphilosophy is that the starting-point of thought and knowledge is\nneither anything \u201csubjective\u201d like sense-data or ideas nor\nanything simply objective like the objects of science, but the lived\nexperience of \u201cbeing-in-the-world\u201d, from which both the\n\u201csubjective\u201d such as sense-data and the\n\u201cobjective\u201d such as objects theorized by science are\nabstractions or constructions made for specific purposes, but which\nshould not be reified in any way that creates a problem of getting\nfrom one side to the other, let alone any possibility of reducing one\nside to the other and thus ending up with a choice between idealism\nand realism. Apart from all issues of style, and whether this has been\nclear to the two parties or not, perhaps the deepest reason for the\non-going divide between \u201canalytical\u201d and\n\u201ccontinental\u201d philosophy is the on-going tension between\nthe impulse to epistemological idealism and the attraction of the idea\nthat \u201cbeing-in-the-world\u201d precedes the very distinction\nbetween subjective and objective. But then again, this underlying idea\nof the Heideggerian approach to philosophy may already be suggested in\nthe work of Schelling, so perhaps the fundamental debate within\ntwentieth-century philosophy has taken place within a framework itself\ninspired by a form of idealism, namely phenomenology. But this would\nbe a long story, for another day.\n\nAt the beginning of the twenty-first century, however, idealism,\nunderstood as a philosophical program, may be sharing the fate of many\nother projects in the history of modern philosophy. Originally\nconceived in the middle of the eighteenth century as a real\nalternative to materialistic and naturalistic perspectives, it may now\nbecome sublated and integrated into views about the nature of reality\nthat ignore metaphysical oppositions or epistemological questions\nconnected with the assumption of the priority of mind over matter or\nthe other way round. Instead the focus may be shifting to establishing\na \u201cneutral\u201d view according to which \u201canything\ngoes\u201d (Feyerabend) as long as it does not contradict or at least\nis not incompatible with our favored metaphysical, epistemological and\nscientific (both natural and social) methods and practices.\n",
