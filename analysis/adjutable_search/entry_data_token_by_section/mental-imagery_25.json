Many conceptual artworks actively try to engage our mental\nimagery in an unexpected manner. Here are two illustrative (and\nfamous) examples, but the point can be generalized.\n\nMarcel Duchamp\u2019s L.H.O.O.Q. Ras\u00e9e (1965) is a\npicture that is perceptually indistinguishable from a faithful\nreproduction of Leonardo\u2019s Mona Lisa. But Duchamp\nearlier made another picture (L.H.O.O.Q.) where he drew a\nmoustache and beard on the picture of Mona Lisa.\nDuchamp\u2019s L.H.O.O.Q. Ras\u00e9e (as\n\u2018ras\u00e9e\u2019 means \u2018shaven\u2019) is a reference\nto this earlier picture and we, presumably, see it differently from\nthe way we see Leonardo\u2019s original: the missing moustache and\nbeard is part of our experience, whereas it is not when we look at\nLeonardo\u2019s original. And it is difficult to see how we can\ndescribe our experience of L.H.O.O.Q. Ras\u00e9e without\nsome reference to the mental imagery of the missing beard and\nmoustache. What is interesting in this example is that the mental\nimagery of the beard and moustache is influenced in a top-down manner\nnot just by our prior knowledge (about how the world is) but also by\nour prior art historical knowledge.\n\nThe second example is Robert Rauschenberg\u2019s Erased de\nKooning drawing (1953), which is just what it says it is: all we\nsee is an empty paper (with hardly visible traces of the erased\ndrawing on it). Again, it is difficult to look at this artwork without\ntrying to discern what drawing might have been there before\nRauschenberg erased it. And this involves trying to conjure up mental\nimagery of the original drawing. Again, these were two classic\nexamples. But there are more. All of Ai Wei Wei\u2019s works, for\nexample, rely heavily on our mental imagery.\n\nNot all works of conceptual art evokes mental imagery this way. One\nexception would be Robert Barry\u2019s All the things I\nknow, which is nothing but the following sentence written on the\ngallery wall with simple block letters: \u201cAll the things I know\nbut of which I am not at the moment thinking \u2013 1:36 PM; June 15,\n1969\u201d. It would be difficult to argue that this work has much\ninterest in enticing the viewer\u2019s mental imagery. But it is not\neasy to find an example of a conceptual artwork where mental imagery\nplays no role. So in the vast majority of conceptual artworks, mental\nimagery is a necessary feature of appreciating the artwork.\n",
