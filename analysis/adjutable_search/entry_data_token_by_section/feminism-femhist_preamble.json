    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe past twenty-five years have seen an explosion of feminist writing on the\nphilosophical canon, a development that has clear parallels in other\ndisciplines like literature and art history. Since most of the writing\nis, in one way or another, critical of the tradition, a natural\nquestion to ask is: Why does the history of philosophy have importance\nfor feminist philosophers? This question assumes that the history of\nphilosophy is of importance for feminists, an assumption that is\nwarranted by the sheer volume of recent feminist writing on the canon.\nThis entry explores the different ways that feminist philosophers are\ninteracting with the Western philosophical tradition. \n\n\nFeminist philosophers engaged in a project of re-reading and\nre-forming the philosophical canon have noticed two significant areas\nof concern. The first is the problem of historical exclusion. Feminist\nphilosophers are faced with a tradition that believes that there are no\nwomen philosophers and, if there are any, they are unimportant. Of\ncourse, women are not entirely absent from the history of philosophy,\nand that brings us to the second challenge we face. Canonical\nphilosophers have had plenty to say about women and what we are like.\nIn general terms, we often find that philosophical norms like reason\nand objectivity are defined in contrast to matter, the irrational or\nwhatever a given philosopher associates with women and the feminine.\nOur tradition tells us, either implicitly through images and metaphors,\nor explicitly in so many words, that philosophy itself, and its norms\nof reason and objectivity, exclude everything that is feminine or\nassociated with women.\n\n\nIn response, feminist philosophers have criticized both the\nhistorical exclusion of women from the philosophical tradition, and the\nnegative characterization of women or the feminine in it. Feminist\nhistorians of philosophy have argued that the historical record is\nincomplete because it omits women philosophers, and it is biased\nbecause it devalues any women philosophers it forgot to omit. In\naddition, feminist philosophers have argued that the philosophical\ntradition is conceptually flawed because of the way that its\nfundamental norms like reason and objectivity are gendered\nmale.[1]\n By means of these criticisms, feminist\nphilosophers are enlarging the philosophical canon and re-evaluating\nits norms, in order to include women in the philosophical \u201cus\u201d.\n\n\nThe following entry contains 4 major sections. Section 1 (\u201cFeminist\nCriticisms of the Canon as Misogynist\u201d) describes feminist readings of\nthe philosophical canon that challenge its derogatory characterizations\nof women. These are of three kinds: (a) readings that record the\nexplicit misogyny of great philosophers (like Aristotle's description\nof a female as a deformed male); (b) readings that argue for gendered\ninterpretations of theoretical concepts (like matter and form in\nAristotle); (c) synoptic interpretations of the canon (like the view\nthat, historically, reason and objectivity are gendered male). The\nthird category of feminist criticisms of the canon diagnoses where\nphilosophy as a whole went most deeply wrong, and, in doing so, it\nconstructs a negative canon of philosophy. The negative canon exposes\nthe ways in which the views of canonical philosophers throughout the\nhistory of philosophy are explicitly or implicitly misogynist or\nsexist. Section 2 (\u201cFeminist Revisions of the History of Philosophy\u201d)\ndiscusses the response of feminist philosophy to the myths that there\nare no women philosophers and, in any case, no important ones. One\nresponse has been the retrieval of women philosophers for the\nhistorical record. A related development is the elevation to the canon\nof women philosophers like Mary Wollstonecraft, Hannah Arendt and\nSimone de Beauvoir. Finally, feminist revisions to the history of \nphilosophy and the canon raise important and pressing questions \nconcerning how to weave women philosophers securely into the story \nof philosophy so that they begin to appear in the philosophical \ncurriculum.  Section 3 (\u201cFeminist Appropriation of Canonical\nPhilosophers\u201d) examines the way that feminist philosophers have been\nengaged in rereading the canon looking for antecedents to feminist\nphilosophy in the work of those philosophers (e.g. Hume) and those\ntheories (e.g. Arisotle's virtue ethics) that are most congenial to\ncurrent trends in feminism or which provide most fuel for feminist\nthought. This is to use the canon as other movements have done\u2014as a\nresource, and as confirmation that a feminist perspective or problem is\nsecurely rooted in our philosophical culture. Section 4 (Feminist \nMethodological Reflections on the History of Philosophy) discusses \nthe methodological issues raised by feminist work on the history of \nphilosophy.  Feminists who are critical of traditional methods of \nreading the history of philosophy have proposed several alternative \nreading strategies that they argue are better suited to feminist \npurposes than traditional methods.  These writers are particularly \nskeptical of the appropriation project outlined in section 3 and \ntheir skepticism provokes interesting questions about what it is \nwe do when we do the history of philosophy.\n",
