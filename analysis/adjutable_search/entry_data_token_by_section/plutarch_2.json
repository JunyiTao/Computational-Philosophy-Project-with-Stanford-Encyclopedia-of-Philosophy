    "main_text": "Logic/Epistemology\n3. Logic/Epistemology\n\n\nLike the Hellenistic Philosophers and Antiochus, Plutarch appears to\nbe particularly sensitive to the question of how we acquire\nknowledge. Plutarch sets out to defend the interpretation of Plato's\nepistemology maintained in the skeptical Academy.  According to this\ninterpretation, suspension of judgment (epoch\u00ea) is the\nbest way to avoid overhasty commitment to opinions (doxai),\nsince the appearances on which they are based can be\ndeceitful. Plutarch defends this epistemological position against the\nStoic accusation that such an attitude leads to inaction, making life\nimpossible, and also against the Epicurean claim that\nsense-experiences are always true. Plutarch distinguishes between\nthree different movements in the soul, which are identical to those\nassumed by the Stoics, namely those of sensation\n(phantastikon), impulse (horm\u00ea), and assent\n(synkatathetikon; Adv. Col. 1122B). The first two\nalone, Plutarch argues, against the Stoics, suffice to produce action\n(Adv. Col. 1122C-D). Since suspension of judgment does not\ninterfere with either perception/sensation or impulse, it does not\naffect our actions but only eliminates opinions\n(ibid. 1122B). Consequently, Plutarch argues, suspension of judgment\nsaves us from making mistakes (1124B) but does not prevent us at all\nfrom acting. Opsomer (1998, 88) has rightly noted that Plutarch's\nargument is very similar to that of the Pyrrhonian skeptics. Plutarch\nrecommends suspension of judgment as a method of testing and\nevaluating knowledge obtained through the senses (Adv. Col.\n1124B). This is not only because the senses often deceive us (De\nprimo frigido 952A, De E392E); the problem according to\nPlutarch rather is that the world is a place that cannot be known\nperfectly. This, however, does not amount to dismissal of the senses,\nwhich is how Colotes criticized Plato\n(Adv. Col. 1114D-F). According to Plutarch, the senses are of\nlimited application because they can at best inform us only about the\nsensible world, which is a world of generation, of appearances, not of\nbeing (De E 392E). For a Platonist like Plutarch, perfect\nknowledge can only be of being, and for that we need to transcend the\nsensible world and move our thought to the intelligible one (De\nIside 382D-383A).\n\nPlutarch makes a sharp distinction between sensible and intelligible\nknowledge, which corresponds to the fundamental ontological\ndistinction between sensible or physical and intelligible reality\n(Plat.  Quest. 1002B-C). He appears to distinguish two\ndistinct faculties of human knowledge, the sensory and the\nintellectual, each of which grasps the corresponding part of reality\n(Plat. Quest. 1002D-E). The cognitive faculty for\nintelligibles, the human intellect, is external to the embodied soul\n(De an. procr. 1026E, Plat.  Quest. 1001C, 1002F;\ncf. Numenius fr. 42 Des Places); the sensory faculty, on the other\nhand, comes about when the soul enters the body (De virtute\nmorali 442B-F; see below, sect. 5), and provides the means for\ndealing effectively in daily life with our needs and circumstances in\nthe physical world as it appears to our senses. In Plutarch's view,\nhuman beings come to understand through the intellect by making use of\nthe notions or concepts (ennoiai), apparently identifiable\nwith the Forms (Plat. Quest. 1001E), with which the intellect\nis inherently equipped. That is, the embodied soul recollects what it\nknows from its inherent familiarity with the intelligible realm, as\nPlato argued in the discussion of anamn\u00easis or\nrecollection in the Meno (Plat. Quest. 1001D, 1002E;\nOpsomer 1998, 193\u2013198). This knowledge of intelligibles is\nsuperior to sensory \u201cknowledge,\u201d which can only remain at\nthe level of belief (pistis) and conjecture\n(eikasia; Plat. Quest. 1001C). Indeed, knowledge of\nintelligibles can take one as far as to understand the divine realm\n(ibid. 1002E, 1004D). But we can achieve this kind of knowledge,\nPlutarch suggests, only when \u201csouls are free to migrate to the\nrealm of the indivisible and the unseen\u201d (De Iside\n382F). This is the main task of philosophy for Plutarch. Philosophy in\nhis view must be inspired by the Socratic practice of inquiry, and\nthis practice amounts to the continuous search for truth, which\npresupposes that, following the example of Socrates, one admits\nignorance (Adv. Col. 1117D, De adulatore et amico\n72A).\n\nAccording to Plutarch, knowledge of intelligibles through\nanamn\u00easis is not in tension with the Academic\nprescription for suspension of judgment; rather, knowledge can be\nadvanced by suspension of judgment, since the latter puts aside\nopinion (doxa) as well as egoism (philautia), both\nof which prevent us from finding the truth\n(Plat. Quest. 1000C). To be in a position to carry out this\nsearch for truth, however, one must search oneself and purify one's\nsoul, Plutarch argues (Adv. Col.  1118C-E). And he points out\nthat Socrates promoted precisely this practice, using the\nelenchus as a purgative medicine, trying to remove false\nclaims to knowledge and arrogance from the souls of his interlocutors,\nand to seek truth along with them, instead of defending his own view\n(Plat. Quest. 999E-F, 1000B, 1000D; Opsomer 1988, 145-150,\nShiffman 2010). Socrates, Plutarch claims, was in a position to do\nthat because he had purified his soul from passions (De genio\nSocratis 588E), hence he was capable of understanding the voice\nof his daim\u00f4n, his intellect (see below, sect. 5).\n\nPlutarch does not defend the Socratic-Academic epistemology only at\nthe theoretical level, but also applies it practically. While\ndiscussing in On the Principle of Cold whether cold is a\nprinciple rather than a privation and whether earth is the primary\ncold element, he defends suspension of judgment as the right attitude\nto take on the matter (955C; see Babut 2007, 72\u201376 contra\nBoys-Stones 1997b). This is indicative of Plutarch's attitude to\nnatural phenomena quite generally. He maintains that natural phenomena\ncannot be understood merely by means of investigating their natural\ncauses. The discovery of the immediate, natural causes, Plutarch\nargues, is only the beginning of an investigation into the first and\nhighest causes, which are intelligible (De primo frigido\n948B-C; Donini 1986a, 210-211, Opsomer 1998, 215\u20136). In other\nwords, a metaphysical explanation in terms of the Forms and god, the\ncreator of the universe, must be sought (De def.  or.\n435E-436A). This is what, for Plutarch, demarcates the philosopher\nfrom the mere natural scientist (physikos; De primo\nfrigido 948B-C), a distinction further exploited by later\nPlatonists (e.g. Atticus fr. 5 Des Places, Porphyry in Simplicius,\nIn Physica 9.10\u201313; fr. 119 Smith). Plutarch is guided\nhere by the dichotomy between natural and intelligible causes found in\nPhaedo 97B-99D and Timaeus 68E-69D (Opsomer 1998,\n183). Explaining the physical world through an appeal to natural\ncauses alone is insufficient, Plutarch argues, since such an explanation\nignores the agent (god) and the end for which something happens in the world\n(De def. or. 435E). The fundamental ontological and\nepistemological distinction between the sensible and intelligible\nrealms suggests to Plutarch an analogous distinction of corresponding\nlevels of explanation (Donini 1986a, 212, Opsomer 1998, 217). Plutarch\nmaintains that there are two levels of causality, physical and\nintelligible, and full understanding of natural phenomena requires the\ngrasping of both. While in the case of natural phenomena suspension of\njudgment maintains an unfailing spirit of research, in the case of\nthe divine realm, where human understanding is seriously limited,\nsuspension of judgment, Plutarch suggests, is due also as a form of\npiety towards the divine (De sera 549E; Opsomer 1998,\n178\u2013179).\n",
