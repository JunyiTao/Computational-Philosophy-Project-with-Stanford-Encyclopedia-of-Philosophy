    "main_text": "\n\nThe purpose of this entry is to explore how atheism and agnosticism\nare related to theism and, more importantly, to each other. This\nrequires examining the surprisingly contentious issue of how best to\ndefine the terms \u201catheism\u201d and \u201cagnosticism\u201d.\nSettling this issue, at least for the purposes of this entry, will set\nthe stage for discussing an important distinction between global\natheism and local atheism, which in turn will be helpful for\ndistinguishing different forms of agnosticism. Examination of an\nargument in support of a modest form of agnosticism will ensue,\nfollowed by discussion of three arguments for atheism and one argument\nagainst a more ambitious form of agnosticism.\n",
