    "main_text": "The Long Reach of Microbiome Research || Individuality issues\n5.1 Individuality issues\n\nPerhaps the most basic philosophical issue that awareness of microbes\nleads to is that of individuality: individuating where one biological\nentity starts and another begins. Are microbes in and on human bodies\npart of those bodies or not? If they are deemed a part, in what way is\nthat parthood conceptualized? Rather than answering this question with\ntraditional tools of mereology (see\n SEP entry on mereology),\n philosophers of biology have focused on biological and evolutionary\ncriteria. In particular, the question of whether hosts and their\nmicrobes evolve as one Darwinian unit has become central to the\ndiscussion (e.g., Clarke 2013; Booth 2014; Godfrey-Smith 2015; Pradeu\n2016; Roughgarden et al. 2018). Criteria for evaluating when symbiotic\nbiological units have become a single evolutionary unit of selection\nare still disputed and promise considerably more philosophical\ndiscussion (see\n SEP entry on individuality).\n What is central to this entry is that such debates are rarely\ninspired by relationships between macroorganisms. The smallness and\nability of microbes to invade host bodies and even cells is what marks\nout microorganisms as the relevant focus of philosophical attention.\nTheir systemic effects on their environments is the other aspect that\nmakes them such important research foci. For example, microbes in the\nintestines are repeatedly linked to host brain states such as\nemotional well-being and depression (e.g., Valles-Colomer et al.\n2019).\n\nWe note, however, that the sheer excitement and novelty of unexpected\nfindings can also lead to exaggerated views of the relationship\nbetween human hosts and their microbes. Exactly how responsible\nmicrobiomes are for human experiences such as anxiety, depression,\nlearning and memory is uncertain and at least sometimes dubious (for\ndiscussion see Hooks et al. 2019). A similarly inflated claim is that\nknowledge of microbiomes necessitates a new view of self, or of what\nit means to be human (e.g., Rees et al. 2018; Ironstone 2018). While\ndozens of microbiome authors have made claims to this effect, with\nsome attempting to explain what it actually means for the microbiome\nto challenge or change our sense of self (e.g., Rees et al. 2018),\nthis claim still needs a great deal of clarification and substantiation (Parke et al. 2018). A\nvast range of things could be meant by \u201cself\u201d or\n\u201cwhat it means to be human\u201d in the context of these\nmicrobiome claims, ranging from something controversial about the\nnature of human biological individuality (see discussion above), to\nsomething factual about the composition of human bodies (i.e., people\nused to think their bodies were made of only human cells but now know\nthey are made of microbial cells as well), to something\nphenomenological about first-person human experience (to date, there\nis no evidence that microbes influence this). So, these claims about\nthe influence of microbiomes on \u201cwho we are\u201d are at best\nspeculative and exaggerated. Some of these conceptual problems\nprobably come about because of unclarity about how to investigate the\ncausal powers of microbiomes, and more generally about causal\nexplanation in microbiome research.\n",
