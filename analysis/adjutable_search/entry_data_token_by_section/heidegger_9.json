    "main_text": "The Later Philosophy || Safeguarding\n3.5 Only a God can Save Us\n\n\nHeidegger sometimes uses the term \u2018god\u2019 to mean the\nsecularized notion of the sacred already indicated, such that to\nembrace a god would be to maintain due sensitivity to the thought that\nbeings are granted to us in the essential unfolding of Being.\nWhen, in the Contributions, Heidegger writes of the last or\nultimate god of the other beginning (where \u2018other\u2019 is in\nrelation to the \u2018first beginning\u2019 of Western thought in\nancient Greece\u2014the beginning of metaphysics), it often seems to\nbe this secularized sacredness that he has in mind (cf. Thomson 2003;\nsee Crownfield 2001for an alternative reading of the last god that\nmaintains a more robust theological dimension, although one which is\nconcrete and historicized). However, Heidegger sometimes seems to use\nthe term \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018divinity\u2019 to refer to a\nheroic figure (a cultural template) who may initiate (or help to\ninitiate) a transformational event in the history of Being by opening\nup an alternative clearing (for this interpretation, see e.g., Young\n2002, 98). These heroic figures are the grounders of the abyss, the\nrestorers of sacredness (Contributions 2: 6, see Sallis 2001\nfor analysis and discussion). It might even be consistent with\nHeidegger's view to relax the requirement that the divine\ncatalyst must be an individual being, and thus to conceive of certain\ntransformational cultural events or forces themselves as divinities\n(Dreyfus 2003). In any case, Heidegger argues that, in the present\ncrisis, we are waiting for a god who will reawaken us to the poetic,\nand thereby enable us to dwell in the fourfold. This task certainly\nseems to be a noble one. Unfortunately, however, it plunges us into the\nmurkiest and most controversial region of the Heideggerian intellectual\nlandscape, his infamous involvement with Nazism.\n\n\nHere is not the place to enter into the historical debate over\nexactly what Heidegger did and when he did it. However, given his\ndeliberate, albeit arguably short-lived, integration of Nazi ideology\nwith the philosophy of Being (see above), a few all-too-brief comments\non the relationship between Heidegger's politics and his\nphilosophical thought are necessary. (For more detailed evidence and\ndiscussion, as well as a range of positions on how we should interpret\nand respond to this relationship, see e.g., Farias 1989; Neske and\nKettering 1990; Ott 1993; Pattison 2000; Polt 1999; Rockmore 1992;\nSluga, 1993; Wolin 1990, 1993; Young 1997). There is no doubt that\nHeidegger's Nazi sympathies, however long they lasted, have a\nmore intimate relationship with his philosophical thought than might be\nsuggested by apologist claims that he was a victim of his time (in\n1933, lots of intelligent people backed Hitler without thereby\nsupporting the Holocaust that was to come) or that what we have here is\n\u2018merely\u2019 a case of bad political judgment, deserving of\ncensure but with no implications for the essentially independent\nphilosophical programme. Why does the explanation run deeper? The\nanswer is that Heidegger believed (indeed continued to believe until he\ndied) that the German people were destined to carry out a monumental\nspiritual mission. That mission was nothing less than to be at the helm\nof the aforementioned transformation of Being in the West, from one of\ninstrumental technology to one of poetic dwelling. In mounting this\ntransformation the German people would be acting not imperialistically,\nbut for all nations in the encounter with modern technology. Of course\ndestining is not a fate that compels, so some divine catalyst would be\nneeded to awake the German nation to its historic mission, a catalyst\nprovided by the spiritual leaders of the Nazi Party.\n\n\nWhy did Heidegger believe that the German people enjoyed this\nposition of world-historical significance? In the later writings\nHeidegger argues explicitly that \u201c[t]hinking itself can be\ntransformed only by a thinking which has the same origin and\ncalling\u201d, so the technological mode of Being must be transcended\nthrough a new appropriation of the European tradition. Within this\nprocess the German people have a special place, because of the\n\u201cinner relationship of the German language with the language of\nthe Greeks and with their thought\u201d. (Quotations from\nOnly a God can Save Us 113.) Thus it is\nthe German language that links the German people in a privileged way\nto, as Heidegger sees it, the genesis of European thought and to a\npre-technological world-view in which bringing-forth as poiesis is\ndominant. This illustrates the general point that, for Heidegger, Being\nis intimately related to language. Language is, as he famously put it\nin the Letter on Humanism (217), the \u201chouse of\nBeing\u201d. So it is via language that Being is linked to particular\npeoples.\n\n\nEven if Heidegger had some sort of argument for the world-historical\ndestiny of the German people, why on earth did he believe that the Nazi\nParty, of all things, harboured the divine catalyst? Part of the reason\nseems to have been the seductive effect of a resonance that exists\nbetween (a) Heidegger's understanding of traditional German rural\nlife as realizing values and meanings that may counteract the insidious\neffects of contemporary technology, and (b) the Nazi image of rustic\nGerman communities, rooted in German soil, providing a bulwark against\nforeign contamination. Heidegger certainly exploits this resonance in\nhis pro-Nazi writings. That said there is an important point of\ndisagreement here, one that Heidegger himself drew out. And once again\nthe role of language in Being is at the heart of the issue. Heidegger\nsteadfastly refused to countenance any biologistic underpinning to his\nviews. In 1945 he wrote that, in his 1934 lectures on logic, he\n\u201csought to show that language was not the biological-racial\nessence of man, but conversely, that the essence of man was based on\nlanguage as a basic reality of spirit\u201d (Letter to\nthe Rector of Freiburg University, November 4, 1945, 64). In words\nthat we have just met, it is language and not biology that, for\nHeidegger, constitutes the house of Being. So the German Volk\nare a linguistic-historical, rather than a biological, phenomenon,\nwhich explains why Heidegger officially rejected one of the keystones\nof Nazism, namely its biologically grounded racism. Perhaps Heidegger\ndeserves some credit here, although regrettably the aforementioned\nlectures on logic also contain evidence of a kind of historically\ndriven \u2018racism\u2019. Heidegger suggests that while Africans\n(along with plants and animals) have no history (in a technical sense\nunderstood in terms of heritage), the event of an airplane carrying\nHitler to Mussolini is genuinely part of history (see Polt 1999,\n155).\n\n\nHeidegger was soon disappointed by his \u2018divinities\u2019. In\na 1935 lecture he remarks that theworks that are being peddled\n(about) nowadays as the philosophy of National Socialism, but have\nnothing whatever to do with the inner truth and greatness of this\nmovement (namely, the encounter between global technology and\ncontemporary man), have all been written by men fishing the troubled\nwaters of values and totalities. (An Introduction to\nMetaphysics 166) So Heidegger came to believe that the spiritual\nleaders of the Nazi party were false gods. They were ultimately agents\nof technological thought and thus incapable of completing the historic\nmission of the German people to transcend global technology.\nNonetheless, one way of hearing the 1935 remark is that Heidegger\ncontinued to believe in the existence of, and the philosophical\nmotivation for, that mission, a view that Rockmore (1992, 123\u20134) calls\n\u201can ideal form of Nazism\u201d. This interpretation has some\nforce. But perhaps we can at least make room for the thought that\nHeidegger's repudiation of Nazism goes further than talk of an\nideal Nazism allows. For example, responding to the fact that Heidegger\ndrew a parallel between modern agriculture (as a motorized\nfood-industry) and \u201cthe manufacturing of corpses in gas chambers\nand extermination camps\u201d, Young (1997) argues that this would\ncount as a devaluing of the Holocaust only on a superficial reading.\nAccording to Young, Heidegger's point is that both modern\nagriculture and the Final Solution are workings-out of the\ntechnological mode of Being, which does not entail that they should be\ntreated as morally equivalent. (Heidegger draws the parallel in a\nlecture called The Enframing given in 1949. The quotation is\ntaken from Young 1997, 172. For further discussion, see Pattison\n2000).\n\n\nHeidegger's involvement with Nazism casts a shadow over his\nlife. Whether, and if so to what extent, it casts a more concentrated\nshadow over at least some of his philosophical work is a more difficult\nissue. It would be irresponsible to ignore the relationship between\nHeidegger's philosophy and his politics. But it is surely\npossible to be critically engaged in a deep and intellectually\nstimulating way with his sustained investigation into Being, to find\nmuch of value in his capacity to think deeply about human life, to\nstruggle fruitfully with what he says about our loss of dwelling, and\nto appreciate his massive and still unfolding contribution to thought\nand to thinking, without looking for evidence of Nazism in every twist\nand turn of the philosophical path he lays down. \n",
