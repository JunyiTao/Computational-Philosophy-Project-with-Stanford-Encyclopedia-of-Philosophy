    "main_text": "Can Normativity Be Given a Naturalistic Explanation? || Normative Objectualism\n3.5 Normative Objectualism\n\nObjectualist theories, unlike conceptualist ones, hold that there are\nworldly states of affairs and properties that are themselves\nnormative. Objectualist theories take it that normativity is found in\nthe world, and not merely in the realm of thought about the world. It\nholds that certain properties and facts instantiate a normativity\nproperty.\n\nAs we saw, normative realism is compatible with both normative\nformalism and normative conceptualism, but it is typically\nobjectualist. In this section, then, we return to normative realism in\nits objectualist form. In\n section 3.1,\n we saw that normativity formalism provides an affirmative answer to\nour guiding question, since it explains normativity by reference to\nrules or norms or social practices. We set aside normativity formalism\nbecause the controversial issue is whether a robust or authoritative\nnormativity can be given a constitutive naturalistic explanation. In\n section 3.2\n we discussed the explanatory challenge faced by realist theories, and\nin\n section 3.3,\n we considered primitivist realist theories, which deny that any\nconstitutive explanation of normativity is possible.\n Section 3.4\n considered both anti-realist and realist versions of normativity\nconceptualism. Non-cognitivist expressivism is a kind of normativity\nconceptualism that offers a naturalistic constitutive explanation of\nthe normativity of normative judgments and concepts. Realist versions\nof conceptualism would either be primitivist, or they would aim to\nprovide a constitutive explanation of the normativity of normative\njudgments and concepts. In this section, we turn to objectualist forms\nof ethical realism and the question whether theories of this kinds are\nable to answer our guiding question.\n\nThere are both naturalist and non-naturalist forms of normativity\nobjectualism. Non-naturalism, however, is typically primitivist. It\ngives a negative answer to our guiding question. As we saw, ethical\nnaturalism can also be primitivist. But if a theory is going to offer\na constitutive explanation of normativity, or constitutive accounts of\nthe normative properties and concepts, in each case the explanans\nproposed by the theory is almost certain to be a natural property or\ncondition. That is, the theory is almost certain to be a kind of\nreductive normative naturalism. Accordingly, this section\ndiscusses theories of this kind.\n\nThere are many varieties of normative naturalism, as we have seen. All\nsuch theories have in common the realist claim that there are worldly\nstates of affairs that are represented by, and that are the truth\nconditions of, normative truths, and that there are properties that\nare referred to and ascribed by normative predicates. Objectualist\nviews add that these properties and states of affairs are normative.\nNaturalist views add that these states of affairs and properties are\nnatural ones.\n\nReductive normative naturalism claims that naturalistic\nconstitutive explanations of normativity and of the normative\nproperties and concepts are available, at least in principle. We began\n section 3\n with the question whether normativity can be given a naturalistic\nconstitutive explanation. Reductive normative naturalism offers an\naffirmative answer. Some naturalists might merely have the\naspirational view that although an adequate reduction is not yet\navailable, we should expect there to be one in the offing, since the\nnormative states of affairs and properties are natural. But the most\ninteresting forms of reductive normative naturalism offer accounts of\nthe nature of normativity, or at least sketches of such. Theories of\nthis kind propose, for each normative explanandum and for the property\nof normativity itself, a natural property as its explanans.\n\nA distinction needs to be drawn between analytic and non-analytic\nreductive normative naturalism. Both kinds of theory claim that\nnormative properties are natural ones and both offer sketches of\nnaturalistic constitutive explanations of these properties. Analytic\ntheories contend that their analyses are conceptual truths,\nwhereas non-analytic ones do not contend this.\n\nThere are many objections to normative naturalism in general and to\nreductive normative naturalism in particular. In this entry, we do not\ninvestigate these objections in detail, or arguments in favor of\nnaturalism. For an examination of these objections and arguments, see\nentries on\n moral naturalism\n and\n moral non-naturalism.\n\nOne might think it is obvious that there could not be a\ncorrect naturalistic constitutive explanation of normativity or of the\nnormative properties. Consider the property wrongness,\nassuming there is such a thing. Assuming that this property is\nnormative, a correct constitutive explanation of the essential nature\nof this property would need to identify a natural property (or\nnaturalistic condition) as the explanans, and this natural property\nwould have to be normative. According to a kind of meta-ethical\nutilitarian naturalism, for example, for an action to be wrong is for\nit to fail to maximize the general happiness. Since wrongness\nis normative, this theory is correct only if the property failing\nto maximize the general happiness is normative. But it might seem\nobvious that this property is not normative, and therefore that the\nutilitarian naturalist view cannot be correct. It is part of the\nessential nature of wrongness that it is normative, but, one\nmight think, it obviously is not part of the essential nature\nof the property of failing to maximize the general happiness that it\nis normative. Indeed, it might seem, this property obviously is not\nnormative. Failing to maximize the general happiness is normatively\nrelevant, the utilitarian thinks, because an action that\nfails in this way is wrong for this reason \u2013 but this is not a\nmatter of its nature. Or so one might think. And, generalizing, one\nmight think that there could not be a correct naturalistic\nconstitutive explanation of the nature of any of the normative\nproperties because natural properties are not normative.\n\nFor a similar reason, one might think there could not be a correct\nnaturalistic constitutive explanation of the (second-order)\nproperty of being normative, or of any of the normativity properties.\nA correct naturalistic account of the essential nature of any such\nproperty would need to identify a natural property (or naturalistic\ncondition) as the explanans, where this explanans would be the\nessential nature of the normative property. But if natural properties\nand conditions are not normative, no such thing could be the essential\nnature of the property of being normative.\n\nThese arguments simply raise the issue whether it is correct that no\nnatural property is normative. A utilitarian naturalist might respond\nto the above argument, for example, by claiming that the nature of the\nproperty of failing to maximize the general happiness is such that\nactions with this property are wrong, and, since wrongness is\nessentially normative, normativity is inherent as well in the nature\nof the property failing to maximize the general\nhappiness.\n\nAt the root of all of the objections to normative naturalism is\nperhaps the \u201cJust too Different\u201d objection, the claim that\nnormative properties are just too different in their nature from\nnatural properties for them to be natural properties (Parfit\n2011; Enoch 2011; Copp 2020a). This is an intuitive claim rather than\nan argument. Derek Parfit contends, for example, that the normative\nconcepts rule out naturalism; that wrongness could no more be\nidentical to some natural property than heat could be identical to a\ncabbage (Parfit 2011, vol. II: 325). A naturalist might respond that,\nsimilarly, heat seems to be too different from mean molecular kinetic\nenergy for it to be identical to that, yet the consensus seems to be\nthat heat is identical to mean molecular kinetic energy, or\nsomething like that. So \u201cjust too different\u201d intuitions\nare hardly decisive.\n\nIn the next section of this entry, we briefly consider several\nexamples of proposed constitutive explanations of normativity,\nincluding both naturalist explanations and other kinds.\n",
