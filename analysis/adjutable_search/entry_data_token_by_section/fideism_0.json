    "main_text": "A Formal Definition\n1. A Formal Definition\n\nAlvin Plantinga has noted that fideism can be defined as an\n\u201cexclusive or basic reliance upon faith alone, accompanied by a\nconsequent disparagement of reason and utilized especially in the\npursuit of philosophical or religious truth\u201d (87).\nCorrespondingly, Plantinga writes, a fideist is someone who\n\u201curges reliance on faith rather than reason, in matters\nphilosophical and religious\u201d and who \u201cmay go on to\ndisparage and denigrate reason\u201d (87). Notice, first, that what\nthe fideist seeks, according to this account, is truth.\nFideism claims that truths of a certain kind can be grasped only by\nforegoing rational inquiry and relying solely on faith. Insofar as\nfideism insists that knowledge of these truths is possible, it must be\ndistinguished from various forms of skepticism with which it otherwise\nshares certain common features. Notice too that this definition is\nlargely formal; the plausibility of fideism as a philosophical\ndoctrine and the proper extension of the term will therefore depend on\nthe content given to the terms \u201cfaith\u201d and\n\u201creason.\u201d\n",
