We can follow this pattern here: We can\ndistinguish between \u201cStrong\u201d and \u201cWeak\u201d AI by\ntaking note of the different goals that these two versions of AI\nstrive to reach. \u201cStrong\u201d AI seeks to create artificial\npersons: machines that have all the mental powers we have, including\nphenomenal consciousness. \u201cWeak\u201d AI, on the other hand,\nseeks to build information-processing machines that appear to\nhave the full mental repertoire of human persons (Searle 1997).\n\u201cWeak\u201d AI can also be defined as the form of AI that aims\nat a system able to pass not just the Turing Test (again, abbreviated\nas TT), but the Total Turing Test (Harnad 1991). In TTT, a\nmachine must muster more than linguistic indistinguishability: it must\npass for a human in all behaviors \u2013 throwing a baseball, eating,\nteaching a class, etc. \n\nIt would certainly seem to be exceedingly difficult for philosophers\nto overthrow \u201cWeak\u201d AI (Bringsjord and Xiao 2000). After\nall, what philosophical reason stands in the way of AI\nproducing artifacts that appear to be animals or even humans?\nHowever, some philosophers have aimed to do in \u201cStrong\u201d\nAI, and we turn now to the most prominent case in point. \n",
