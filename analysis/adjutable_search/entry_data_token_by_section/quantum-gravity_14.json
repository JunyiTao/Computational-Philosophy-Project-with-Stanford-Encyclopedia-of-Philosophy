Of course, in general relativity the metric is what\none solves for: the metric is a dynamical variable, which implies that\nthe geometry of spacetime is dynamical. This intuitive notion is\nbundled into the concept of background freedom, or background\nindependence. In general, background independence is understood to be\nthe freedom of a theory from background structures, where the latter\namount to some kind of absolute, non-dynamical objects in a theory.\nThe extent to which their respective theories incorporate background\nstructures has recently proven to be a divisive subject amongst string\ntheorists and loop quantum gravity theorists and others. It is often\nclaimed that the central principle that distinguishes general\nrelativity from other theories is its (manifest) background\nindependence. But background independence is a slippery notion meaning\ndifferent things to different people. We face a series of questions\nwhen considering background independence: What, exactly, is it (beyond\nthe simple intuitive notion)? Why is it considered to be such an\nimportant principle? What theories incorporate it? To what\nextent do they incorporate it?\n\nThe debate between strings and loops on this matter is severely\nhampered by the fact that there is no firm definition of background\nindependence on the table and, therefore, the two camps are almost\ncertainly talking past each other when discussing this issue. It seems\nprima facie reasonable to think that in order to reproduce a\nmanifestly background independent theory like general relativity, a\nquantum theory of gravity should be background independent too, and so\nbackground independence has begun to function as a constraint on\nquantum gravity theories, in much the same way that renormalizability\nused to constrain the construction of quantum field theories.\nAdvocates of loop quantum gravity often highlight the background\nindependence of their theory as a virtue that it has over string\ntheory. However, there is no proof of this implication, and aspects of\nthe so-called \u2018holographic principle\u2019 seem to suggest that\na background independent theory could be dual to a background\ndependent theory (see the contributions to Biquard, ed., 2005).\nFurthermore, depending on how we define the intuitive notion of\nbackground independence, and if \u2018clues\u2019 from the duality\nsymmetries of M-theory are anything to go by, it looks like string\ntheory might even be more background independent than loop\nquantum gravity, for the dimensionality of spacetime becomes a\ndynamical variable too (cf. Stelle, 2000, p. 7).\n\nIndeed, various string theorists claim that their theory is background\nindependent. In many cases it seems that they have a different\nunderstanding of what this entails than loop quantum gravity\nresearchers\u2014this takes us to the first, definitional, question.\nIn particular some seem to think that the ability to place a general\nmetric in the Lagrangian amounts to background independence. This\nfalls short of the mark for how the majority of physicists understand\nit, namely as a reactive dynamical coupling between spacetime and\nmatter. Though one can indeed place a variety of metrics in the\nstringy Lagrangian, one does not then vary the metric in the action.\nThere is no interaction between the strings and the ambient spacetime.\nIndeed, this is not really distinct from quantum field theory of point\nparticles in curved spacetimes: the same freedom to insert a general\nmetric appears there too.\n\nThere is an alternative argument for the background independence of\nstring theory that comes from the field theoretic formulation of the\ntheory: string field theory. The idea is that classical spacetime\nemerges from the two dimensional conformal field theory on the strings\nworldsheet. However, in this case one surely has to say something\nabout the target space, for the worldsheet metric takes on a metric\ninduced from the ambient target spacetime. Yet another argument for\nthe background independence of string theory might point to the fact\nthat the dimensionality of spacetime in string theory has to satisfy\nan equation of motion (a consistency condition): this is how the\ndimensionality comes out (as 26 or 10, depending on whether one\nimposes supersymmetry). One contender for the definition of background\nindependence is a structure that is dynamical in the sense that one\nhas to solve equations of motion to get at its values. In this case we\nwould have extreme background independence stretching to the structure\nof the manifold itself. However, the problem with this is that this\nstructure is the same in all models of the theory; yet we intuitively\nexpect background independent theories to be about structures that can\nvary across a theory\u2019s models.\n\nThe issues here are clearly subtle and complex, and philosophers have\nonly just begun to consider them. The central problem faced, as a\nphilosopher, when trying to make sense of claims such as these is that\nthere is no solid, unproblematic definition of background structure\n(and therefore background independence and dependence) on the table.\nWithout this, one simply cannot decide who is right; one cannot decide\nwhich theories are background independent and which are not. Hence, an\nurgent issue in both physics and the philosophy of physics is to work\nout exactly what is meant by \u2018background independence\u2019 in\na way that satisfies all parties, that is formally correct, and that\nsatisfies our intuitive notions of the concept. Until this is\nachieved, background independence cannot be helpfully used to\ndistinguish the approaches, nor can we profitably discuss its merits.\nA serious attempt to define background independence in such a way as\nto make these tasks possible has been made by Domenico Giulini (2007).\nBut Giulini admits that a general definition still eludes us. The\nstumbling block might be that background independence simply\nisn\u2019t a formal property of theories at all. Gordon Belot (2011b)\nhas recently argued that background independence is partly an\ninterpretive matter, and that one can have varying levels of\nbackground independence (the latter notion is also defended by Lee\nSmolin, 2006). Rickles (2008b) argues that the place to seek a notion\nof background independence that can be put to use in the quantum\ngravitational context is by focusing on the kinds of\nobservables that an approach employs, rather than squarely on\nproperties of the equations of motion.\n",
