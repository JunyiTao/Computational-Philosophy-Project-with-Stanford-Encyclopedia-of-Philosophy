    "main_text": "Leibniz || Where Did the Folk Go Wrong?\n6.4 Where Did the Folk Go Wrong?\n\nSo the folk reading simply ignores Leibniz\u2019s metaphysics of\nmotion, it commits Leibniz to a mathematical howler regarding his\nlaws, and it is arguable whether it is the best rendering of his\npronouncements concerning relativity; it certainly cannot be accepted\nunquestioningly. However, it is not hard to understand the temptation\nof the folk reading. In his Correspondence with Clarke,\nLeibniz says that he believes space to be \u201csomething merely\nrelative, as time is, \u2026 an order of coexistences, as time is an\norder of successions\u201d (LIII.4), which is naturally taken to mean\nthat space is at base nothing but the distance and temporal relations\nbetween bodies. (Though even this passage has its subtleties, because\nof the ideality of space discussed above, and because in\nLeibniz\u2019s conception space determines what sets of relations are\npossible.) And if relative distances and times exhaust the\nspatiotemporal in this way, then shouldn\u2019t all\nquantities of motion be defined in terms of those relations?\n\nWe have seen two ways in which this would be the wrong conclusion to\ndraw. Force seems to involve a notion of speed that is not\nidentified with any relative speed. And (unless the equivalence of\nhypotheses is after all a principle of general relativity), the laws\npick out a standard of constant motion that need not be any constant\nrelative motion. Of course, it is hard to reconcile these quantities\nwith the view of space and time that Leibniz proposes \u2013 what is\nspeed in size times speed2 or\nconstant speed if not speed relative to some body or to\nabsolute space? Given Leibniz\u2019s view that space is literally\nideal (and indeed that even relative motion is not \u2018entirely\nreal\u2019) perhaps the best answer is that he took force\nand hence motion in its real sense not to be determined by\nmotion in a relative sense at all, but to be primitive monadic\nquantities. That is, he took x moves to be a 1-place\npredicate, but he believed that it could be fully analyzed in terms of\nstrictly monadic predicates: x moves iff x\npossesses-non-zero-derivative-active-force. And this reading\nexplains just what Leibniz took us to be supposing when we\n\u2018supposed certain bodies to be unchanged\u2019 in the\nconstruction of the idea of space: that they had no force, nothing\ncausing, or making real any motion.\n",
