    "main_text": "Conception of Being and God\u2019s Existence\n4. Conception of Being and God\u2019s Existence\n\nAvicenna\u2019s proof of God\u2019s existence, famously known as\n\u201cBurh\u0101n al-\u1e63idiqin\u201d, Demonstration of\nthe Truthful (Mayer 2001), occupies a good deal of Albalag\u2019s critical\ndiscussion. The proof is meant to be a metaphysical proof, one that\ntakes place in the science of Metaphysics and proceeds from analyses\nof the conception of existence qua existence.\n\nAvicenna divides \u201cactual\u201d beings, as opposed to impossible\nthings, into necessary in itself and possible in itself but necessary\nthrough another (Davidson 1987: 292\u20133; McGinnis 2010:\n159\u2013164). The necessary in itself is that which has existence in\nits essence and an impossibility arises whenever it is assumed not to\nexist. By contrast, the possible in itself but necessary through\nanother is that which \u201chas no existence in essence\u201d and\n\u201cno impossibility\u201d arises whether it is assumed to exist\nor not (Avicenna al-Naj\u0101t: 546; cf.\nal-\u02beishar\u0101t: 122; cf. al-Ghazali\nMaq\u0101\u1e63id: 100\u2013101). In other words, both\nexistence and non-existence are equal states with respect to it. This\nlatter point is crucial to Avicenna\u2019s proof, for it stipulates\nthat there must be an external cause that ultimately preponderates\nexistence over non-existence in things that are possible. This cause\nmust be necessary in itself. Considering all possible things as an\n\u201caggregate\u201d (jumlah), two alternatives arise in\nregard to the cause of that aggregate (Avicenna,\nal-Naj\u0101t: 567\u20138): either the aggregate of possible\nthings is self-caused or caused by something external. Avicenna\ndismisses the former alternative as impossible because the nature of\nwhat is possible in itself does not change independently of a cause;\npossible things become necessary only through other causes. Hence, an\naggregate of possible things is also possible in itself and cannot be\nself-caused. Furthermore, \u201ca chain\u201d (silsilah) of\npossible things cannot continue ad infinitum and it must end\nto a being that is necessary in itself. The trait of \u201cnecessary\nexistence\u201d further entails a number of divine attributes such as\noneness, simplicity and goodness, which permits identifying the\nNecessary Existent with the deity (Adamson 2013: 172).\n\nTo Albalag, Avicenna\u2019s proof of God as Necessary Existent\nappeared to involve flagrant deviations from Aristotle. Firstly,\nAvicenna\u2019s procedure for establishing the existence of the First\nPrinciple in the science of metaphysics is methodologically incorrect.\n(Tiqqun n.8: 13\u201314). Appealing to Averroes, Albalag\nargues that the existence of the prime mover must be accepted from\nnatural philosophy\u2014not insofar as it is the deity\u2014while\nmetaphysicians proceed therefrom in examining its states and\nattributes. Obviously, the theoretical basis for this argument is\nAristotle\u2019s rule that \u201cno master of any art can\ndemonstrate the proper principles of his art\u201d\n(Metaphysics IV 1003a21\u201322), which, according to\nAverroes, means that a given science does not demonstrate the\nexistence of its subject, but must concede to their existence either\nas something which is \u201cself-evident\u201d or as\n\u201csomething that has been demonstrated in another science\u201d\n(Wolfson 1950\u20131 : 691). Since the First\nPrinciple is the subject matter of metaphysics, its existence cannot\nbe established in that specific science.\n\nSecondly, Avicenna breaks away from Aristotle in that he proceeds in\nestablishing the existence of the First Principle from analyses of the\nconception of being rather than motion and moved objects (for\nAristotle\u2019s argument see Physics 7 & 8). In order\nto establish the Necessary Existent, Avicenna proceeds from a\nconception of being that Albalag, following Averroes, dismisses as\nspurious (for Averroes see al-kashf: 14). His discomfort with\nthis conception has to do primarily with the fact that it is alien to\nAristotle. But Albalag additionally speaks of errors and absurd implications,\nespecially in the science of metaphysics, that follow from\nAvicenna\u2019s method of distinguishing two types of necessary\nexistents, i.e., that which is necessary in itself and that which is\nnecessary by another. One implication pertains to the nature of\nseparate intellects. Assuming that anything which is not\nnecessary in itself involves two modes, necessity and possibility, as\nAvicenna holds, then separate intellects would also involve both\nnecessity and possibility. This, however, absurdly clashes with the\nessential nature of separate intellects as immaterial beings, since\npossibility must reside in a substratum (Tiqqun n.8: 14, \nn.29: 27).\n\nThese deviations from Aristotle provided Albalag with sufficient\nreason to reject the metaphysical proof of God. Moreover,\nAvicenna\u2019s supplementary arguments, as reproduced by al-Ghazali\nin the Maq\u0101\u1e63id, to the effect that the Necessary\nExistent is one, simple and incorporeal fall short of satisfying the\nepistemic criterion of dispelling doubt (i.e., certainty), unlike\nAristotle\u2019s argument from motion which, as Albalag asserts,\n\u201cdispels doubt\u201d (Tiqqun n.33: 53). But although\nAlbalag only trusts Aristotle\u2019s argument, he points to a subtle\nproblem whose origin goes back to ancient commentaries on Aristotle:\nthe problem of the relation of the Prime Mover to the deity (for this\nproblem see Avicenna Shif\u0101\u02be\n[Metaphysics]: 13). Aristotle\u2019s argument from motion\narrives at the existence of a mover that is not a body or a force in a\nbody. But whether that mover is the First Principle/Cause, i.e., the\ndeity, or a first effect remains an open question (Tiqqun\nn.8: 14, n.38: 61). Philosophers hold no unanimous answer to this\nquestion. While Avicenna concludes that the deity is ontologically\nsuperior to the Prime Mover known from Aristotle\u2019s analyses of\nmotion (Tiqqun n.38: 61), Averroes identifies the Prime Mover\nwith the deity in all his writings (see for instance the\nCommentary on Metaphysics: 172)\u2014the exclusion being, as\nAlbalag correctly notes, the Epitome of Metaphysics (see\nTal\u1e96\u012b\u1e63 m\u0101 ba\u02bfd\nal-\u1e6dabi\u02bfah: 149) where Averroes follows\nAvicenna\u2019s standpoint (Tiqqun n.69: 96).\n\nCuriously, Albalag does not immediately side with either camp.\nHowever, his discussions of the relation of the Prime Mover to the\ncelestial and sublunary realms confirm Averroes\u2019 standpoint by\nestablishing the primacy of the Prime Mover as a cause of all\nsublunary and celestial entities, and Its absolute unity and\nsimplicity, two essential specifications of the deity (see below).\n",
