    "main_text": "Socrates as the dominant speaker\n7. Socrates as the dominant speaker\n\nIf we take Plato to be trying to persuade us, in many of his works, to\naccept the conclusions arrived at by his principal interlocutors (or\nto persuade us of the refutations of their opponents), we can easily\nexplain why he so often chooses Socrates as the dominant speaker in\nhis dialogues. Presumably the contemporary audience for whom Plato was\nwriting included many of Socrates\u2019 admirers. They would be\npredisposed to think that a character called \u201cSocrates\u201d\nwould have all of the intellectual brilliance and moral passion of the\nhistorical person after whom he is named (especially since Plato often\nmakes special efforts to give his \u201cSocrates\u201d a life-like\nreality, and has him refer to his trial or to the characteristics by\nwhich he was best known); and the aura surrounding the character\ncalled \u201cSocrates\u201d would give the words he speaks in the\ndialogue considerable persuasive power. Furthermore, if Plato felt\nstrongly indebted to Socrates for many of his philosophical techniques\nand ideas, that would give him further reason for assigning a dominant\nrole to him in many of his works. (More about this in section 12.)\n\nOf course, there are other more speculative possible ways of\nexplaining why Plato so often makes Socrates his principal speaker.\nFor example, we could say that Plato was trying to undermine the\nreputation of the historical Socrates by writing a series of works in\nwhich a figure called \u201cSocrates\u201d manages to persuade a\ngroup of na\u00efve and sycophantic interlocutors to accept absurd\nconclusions on the basis of sophistries. But anyone who has read some\nof Plato\u2019s works will quickly recognize the utter implausibility\nof that alternative way of reading them. Plato could have written into\nhis works clear signals to the reader that the arguments of Socrates\ndo not work, and that his interlocutors are foolish to accept them.\nBut there are many signs in such works as Meno,\nPhaedo, Republic, and Phaedrus that point\nin the opposite direction. (And the great admiration Plato feels for\nSocrates is also evident from his Apology.) The reader is\ngiven every encouragement to believe that the reason why Socrates is\nsuccessful in persuading his interlocutors (on those occasions when he\ndoes succeed) is that his arguments are powerful ones. The reader, in\nother words, is being encouraged by the author to accept those\narguments, if not as definitive then at least as highly arresting and\ndeserving of careful and full positive consideration. When we\ninterpret the dialogues in this way, we cannot escape the fact that we\nare entering into the mind of Plato, and attributing to him, their\nauthor, a positive evaluation of the arguments that his speakers\npresent to each other.\n",
