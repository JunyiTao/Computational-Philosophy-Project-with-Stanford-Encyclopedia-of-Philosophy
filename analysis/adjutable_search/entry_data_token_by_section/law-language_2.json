    "main_text": "The use of language in law || Language and legal interpretation\n2.2 Language and legal interpretation\n\nWhat is the relationship between the language that is used to make\nlegal standards, and the law itself? If the law provides that a form\nof words determines the content of a standard (such as a term of a\ncontract, or a criminal offence, or a duty of the executor of a will),\nwhat is the effect of the use of the words? The question seems to\ndemand general theories of the meaning of language and of the\ninterpretation of communicative acts. If there are no general theories\nto be had, then there is no general answer to the question. A theory\nof meaning and interpretation of legal language would not be very much\nless general than a theory of meaning and interpretation of\nlanguage.\n\nLegal theorists have tried to construct theories of the meaning of\nlegal language, and theories of legal interpretation, based on\nspecific features of law, of legal systems, and of the use of language\nin making law. The entries on\n constitutionalism\n (see section 7, \u2018Constitutional Interpretation\u2019),\n interpretation and coherence in legal reasoning,\n legal interpretation,\n legal interpretivism,\n the nature of law, and\n naturalism in legal philosophy\n all address theories of legal interpretation. This section addresses\nfeatures of language that raise challenges for philosophy of law and\nfor philosophy of language. Any good account of the legal effect of\nthe use of language in law making depends on the context of its use\n(addressed in this section). Section 2.3 addresses\n\u2018pragmatic\u2019 effects of language use, such as\ncontext-dependence, which have long been the matter of jurisprudential\ndebate; recently the use of Gricean and post-Gricean\n pragmatics\n has become a major field of debate among philosophers of language and\nphilosophers of law. These pragmatic features of communication raise\ninsuperable difficulties for any attempt to give a true account of\nlegal interpretation that is well enough organised to deserve to be\ncalled a \u2018theory\u2019. Debates over the pragmatics of legal\nlanguage are often premised on the view that the effect of a lawmaking\nuse of language is that the content of the linguistic communication in\nquestion determines the content of the law. But we will see in section\n3 that even this premise is controversial; it has been denied by\ntheorists who account for the law as being determined by moral reasons\nfor conclusions as to what rights, duties, powers, and liabilities\npeople have, given the facts of legal practice and history.\n\nAs an instance of controversy over the effect of the use of language\nin law, consider the case of Garner v Burr [1951] 1 KB 31.\nThe legislature had made it an offence to use a \u2018vehicle\u2019\non a road without pneumatic tires. Lawrence Burr fitted iron wheels to\nhis chicken coop, and pulled it down the road behind his tractor. Burr\nwas prosecuted under the statute. The magistrates acquitted him,\napparently on the ground that a chicken coop is not a\n\u2018vehicle\u2019. The appeal court reversed that decision. The\nLord Chief Justice wrote,\n\nThe regulations are designed for a variety of reasons, among them the\nprotection of road surfaces; and, as this vehicle had ordinary iron\ntyres, not pneumatic tyres, it was liable to damage the roads. [The\nmagistrates] have put what is in my opinion too narrow an\ninterpretation on the word \u2018vehicle\u2019 for the purposes of\nthis Act. It is true that, according to the dictionary definition, a\n\u2018vehicle\u2019 is primarily to be regarded as a means of\nconveyance provided with wheels or runners and used for the carriage\nof persons or goods. It is true that the [magistrates] do not find\nthat anything was carried in the vehicle at the time; but I think that\nthe Act is clearly aimed at anything which will run on wheels which is\nbeing drawn by a tractor or another motor vehicle. Accordingly, an\noffence was committed here. It follows that [the magistrates] ought to\nhave found that this poultry shed was a vehicle within the meaning of\ns. 1 of the Road Traffic Act of 1930. ([1951] 1 KB 31 at 33)\n\n\nThe magistrates and the appeal court seem to have disagreed over the\neffect of two principles: a principle that statutes should only be\nread as imposing criminal liability if they do so unequivocally, and a\nprinciple that the purposes for which Parliament passed the statute\nshould be pursued. Assume that those principles are legal\nprinciples, in the sense that a decision in accordance with the law\nmust respect them. The apparent tension between the principles might\nbe resolved in one of the following two ways. We do not have the\nmagistrates\u2019 reasons, but let\u2019s presume that they resolved\nthe tension in the first way; the appeal court resolved it in the\nsecond way:\n\n1. by concluding that Parliament\u2019s purposes can be respected\nappropriately while still construing the prohibition narrowly (so that\nit is no offence to pull a chicken coop down the road on iron wheels,\nbecause the chicken coop is not undeniably a vehicle), or\n\n\n2. by concluding that Parliament\u2019s purpose is sufficiently clear\nthat it can be pursued by convicting Mr.Burr, without jeopardising the\nprinciple that criminal liabilities ought to be clearly spelled out,\neven if someone might reasonably claim that a chicken coop on wheels\nis not a \u2018vehicle\u2019.\n\n\nIt may seem that this common sort of disagreement tells us nothing\nabout language, except perhaps that language is of no particular\nimportance in law. It may seem that the two courts did not disagree\nover any question of language (after all, everyone involved was\ncompetent in English), but only over whether they ought to give effect\nto Parliament\u2019s evident purpose of protecting roads by\nconvicting Mr.Burr, or whether that would be unfair to him.\n\nOne explanation of the decision would be that the appeal court ignored\nthe word \u2018vehicle\u2019, and treated the pneumatic tires rule\nas if it applied to anything that moves on wheels (instead of applying\nto vehicles, which is what the legislation said). But the Lord Chief\nJustice did not explain his decision that way. He did not hold that,\nbecause Parliament aimed to protect roads from iron wheels, Burr\nshould be convicted regardless of the meaning of the word\n\u2018vehicle\u2019. He held that the magistrates ought to have\nfound that the chicken coop was a vehicle, \u2018for the\npurposes\u2019 of the Road Traffic Act. Presumably the magistrates,\ntoo, considered themselves to be giving effect to the language of the\nAct, rather than ignoring (in the interests of fairness) what\nParliament had enacted.\n\nNo doubt, legal decisionmakers sometimes depart from what the\nlegislature provided in a valid enactment (or a testator provided in a\nvalid will...). They may do so corruptly, or in the exercise of an\nequitable jurisdiction to depart from the law, or because they\nconsider that justice demands it even if the law accords them no power\nto depart from the enactment or the will. But in Garner v\nBurr, the magistrates and the appeal judges evidently saw\nthemselves as giving effect to the Road Traffic Act. And the sort of\ndisagreement that arose in that case (disagreement over the legal\neffect of the use of a word) is so common that we seem to find a\nparadox:\n\nThe apparent paradox of legislative language:\n\nCompetent speakers of the English language share a knowledge of the\nmeaning of the word \u2018vehicle\u2019, and the law that is made by\nlegislation using the word must be determined by the meaning of the\nword, yet English speakers disagree\u2014apparently\nsincerely\u2014over the effect of legislation using the word.\n\n\nTo resolve the apparent paradox of legislative language, we can say\nthat what speakers of the English language share, in virtue of their\ngrasp of the meaning of a word like \u2018vehicle\u2019, is an\nability to use the word in a way that depends on the context. The\nquestion of whether a chicken coop on wheels counts as a\n\u2018vehicle\u2019 would be a different question (and might have a\ndifferent answer), if another statute or regulation imposed a tax on\n\u2018vehicles\u2019. The relevant considerations might be different\nagain if a statute or regulation required \u2018vehicles\u2019 to\nkeep to the left-hand side of the road. The Lord Chief Justice was\nright that a dictionary definition of \u2018vehicle\u2019 could not\nconclude the question of whether the chicken coop was a vehicle in\nGarner v Burr, because the purpose of a dictionary definition\nis to point the reader to features of the use of the word that can be\nmore-or-less important in a variety of more-or-less analogical ways in\nvarious contexts. A definition of \u2018vehicle\u2019 as a mode of\nconveyance offers the reader one central strand in the use of that\nword, but does not tell the reader whether a more-or-less analogical\nextension of the word to a chicken coop on wheels is warranted or\nunwarranted by the meaning of the word. Another way of stating this\nresolution of the apparent paradox of legislative language is by\ndistinguishing between the meaning of a word (which the magistrates\nand the appeal judges all knew) and the way in which a communicative\nact using the word ought to be understood (over which they disagreed).\nThe judges and magistrates in Garner v Burr shared a\nknowledge of the meaning of the word \u2018vehicle\u2019; they could\nall share mastery of that word, while disagreeing over the effect of\nthe legislature\u2019s use of the word. The evident good sense of\nthat proposition has led some philosophers to theories that state or\nimply that law is not made by the use of language; see section 3\nbelow.\n",
