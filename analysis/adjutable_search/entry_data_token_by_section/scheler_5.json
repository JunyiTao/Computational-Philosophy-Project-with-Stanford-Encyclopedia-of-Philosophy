    "main_text": "Social and Political Theory\n6. Social and Political Theory\n\nScheler\u2019s social and political thought matures in the fertile\nintellectual ground of the sociological and political debates of the\nearly 20th century. The context of Scheler\u2019s thought\nis the creation of sociology as a discipline and Scheler seeks to\nplace himself in the critical exchange with the major players of this\ntime in sociology and politics, such as Max Weber, Emile Durkheim,\nWilhelm Dilthey, Oswald Spengler, Herbert Spencer, Ferdinand\nT\u00f6nnies and Karl Schmitt. Scheler\u2019s socio-political thought\nwas born from within the cultural crisis experienced in Germany both\npreceding and most emphatically following World War I.\n\nEarly in his writings, Scheler represents the Christian voice of the\nleft. The central question for Scheler and for socio-political thought\nat this time in Germany was whether an alternative to either\nliberalism or socialism was possible. Scheler argues early that\nChristian democracy is the most profound and viable alternative,\nshowing how the resource for a cultural and political renewal is the\nChristian notion of love and solidarity. The explicitly religious\naspect of Scheler\u2019s socio-political thought lessens to a degree\nin the latter stages of his thought, but he never abandons the idea of\nsolidarity as the basis for a more just and peaceful future, a future\nwhere the people collectively and in solidarity take up the task of\ntransforming the world in which we live.\n\nScheler\u2019s premature death would prevent him from experiencing\nfirsthand the unthinkable and horrific consequences of the social and\npolitical crises Germany faced during the early 20th\ncentury. The crisis was for him not merely a German problem, but the\nproblem of modernity in general. Scheler did not hesitate to speak in\ngeneral and singularizing terms like \u201cthe German culture,\u201d\n\u201cthe European culture\u201d or even \u201cthe West.\u201d\nWith such generalities as \u201cthe modern worldview,\u201d Scheler\ncould identify the underlying ethos, i.e., the order of valuing, of a\nculture and describe the dominant tendencies responsible for the\nsocial and cultural crisis. However, Scheler used the terms \u201cthe\nGerman culture\u201d or \u201cthe European culture\u201d as a means\nto preserve a unique and irreplaceable spiritual development of a\npeople. The attempt to defend the meaning and culture of a people\ncontinued to be a cause for tension in Scheler\u2019s thought, a\ntension that would lead him to defend German aggression at the outset\nof World War I and a tension that motivated his critique of fascism\nand his support for the necessity of the ideal of peace.\n\nThe crisis of modernity was, for Scheler, the result of three central\nfactors or mindsets: (1) the rise of late capitalism, (2) the\nmechanization of nature, and (3) liberal individualism.\nScheler\u2019s description of these three as \u201cmindsets\u201d\n(Denkformen) is purposeful. Particularly in respect to\ncapitalism, he wants to distinguish his work from that of Weber and\nSombart, specifically from their work on the \u201cspirit\u201d of\ncapitalism. On the other hand, he wants to retain an understanding of\ncapitalism, for instance, as not merely an economic system, but as an\napproach and a way of configuring the world.\n\nCapitalism, the mechanization of nature and liberal individualism are\nreductive mindsets. A reductive mindset is a way of viewing the world\nthat devalues all other possible views. The mechanization of nature,\nfor example, becomes not merely one form of knowledge of nature, but\nthe only way in which to know it. All reductive mindsets are, for\nScheler, ultimately rooted in a value reversal. The value reversal\nthat all three of these mindsets share is the promotion of utility\nover the value of life. As a consequence, a living being only has\nvalue in so far as it is useful. Late capitalism is the economic\nexpression of the value reversal. All goods, objects and beings are\nvaluable only in so far as they are able to generate more wealth. The\nmechanization of nature is the reduction of a living being to a\nmechanism or a machine for the purposes of manipulation and control\nand for achieving some useful end for human beings. Liberal\nindividualism is the reduction of all forms of community to society.\nAs a result, all interpersonal relations are regarded as artificial\nand contractual, relations formed for the benefit of the\nindividual\u2019s interests.\n\nTogether these different but related mindsets create a worldview, the\nmodern Weltanschauung, and succeed in transforming the world\ninto an object of utility. The value reduction to utility poses not\nonly a threat to the life and the welfare of living beings, but also\nto the cultural and spiritual values. Utility, as the dominant value,\ndoes not destroy the higher values. It cultivates, rather, a type of\nvalue blindness. People lose sight of the value of spiritual pursuits\nsuch as the arts, philosophy and religion. Spiritual values are only\nnoticed through their usefulness. When a culture becomes blind to the\nhigher values, it also loses sight of its uniqueness as a culture and\nas a people. At the level of utility, people are more alike. Cultural\ndifferences matter very little when the goals become efficiency and\nproductivity. It is the higher, spiritual values that reveal the\nuniqueness of a specific culture. The end of the modern worldview,\nScheler maintains, is an internationalization of all cultures, a\nmaking of all peoples and cultures one and the same (GW IV, 600).\n\nScheler has little interest in merely remaining a spectator to the\ncrisis and his writing offers the means to overcome it. While he\nanalyzes the main factors responsible for the crisis of modernity,\nScheler\u2019s suggestions for overcoming it change dramatically. His\nfirst and most troublesome response to the crisis was war. During his\ntime earning a living as a freelance writer, Scheler worked for the\nstate\u2019s office of propaganda during the year leading up to and\nimmediately following the outbreak of World War I. Like many\nintellectuals at the time, Scheler was a vociferous defender of German\naggression and thought that the war could function as a means to\nawaken the German people from cultural slumber and value blindness. In\nhis major work on the war, Der Genius des Krieges und der deutsche\nKrieg (The Genius of War and the German War) Scheler\ndistinguishes three different levels on which war functions as a\ncultural renewal.\n\n\n\nScheler argues that war is quite natural to life as it is a natural\nconsequence of the organism\u2019s growth. More importantly, these\nconflicts among living beings function as an important reminder of the\nvalue of life and the types of trusting and communal relations that\nemerge through a sharing of life with other human beings.\n\n\nWar is also a significant factor in the growth of a culture. The Great\nWar was a war of culture and lifestyles. Through this conflict,\nGermany would be reminded of its uniqueness. Conflict serves as an\nincredibly stark reminder of how one\u2019s own culture differs from\nsomeone else\u2019s. This must not necessarily be a judgment of which\nculture is better, but rather functions as an awakening to one\u2019s\nown particular culture and one\u2019s particular role in preserving\nand promoting one\u2019s own culture.\n\n\nFinally, Scheler discusses the value level of the holy and it is at\nthis level that the war finds its greatest significance. Scheler\nbegins this analysis by showing first how war and violence are not\nanti-religious acts, but are very much a part of religious belief,\nattempting to make sense of loving one\u2019s enemy on the\nbattlefield. These remarks are only preparatory. The genuine holy\nsignificance of the war for Germany comes from the realization that\nthe war is a battle for justice. Scheler is not pro-war and argues\nthat the only justified war is a defensive war that defends against\nthe annihilation of the significant values of a culture (GW IV, 101).\nFor Scheler, Germany is not the aggressor, but England is. This\naggression is only made explicit through the type of worldview and\nmindset analysis that Scheler gives. At stake is the annihilation of\nthe German people, a wholly unjust act. Hence, when Germany rises to\nbattle, it is defending not only itself, but also justice, fighting\nagainst tyrannical forces aiming to destroy a culture and a\npeople.\n\n\nScheler\u2019s analysis and justification of German aggression\nleading to the war is confused for many reasons, many of which Scheler\nhimself acknowledges in his later writings. A central confusion\nScheler recognizes concerns the meaning and the possibility of\nrenewal. Renewal, as Scheler writes later, only takes place through an\nact of repentance and thus can never be motivated by hatred. Scheler\nwrites specifically with respect to the possibility of a political\nreconstruction that what is necessary is a collective proclamation of\nguilt, not merely for the war, but also for the cultural depression\nand value degradation for which every member of the German and\nEuropean community is responsible (GW V, 416). Acts of repentance,\nindividual or collective, assume a moral transformation. Whereas war\nfinds its resource for renewal through the violent conflict with the\nenemy, repentance grounds its renewal in the ethical insight into the\nperson I ought to be. The act of repentance and the expression of\nguilt are acts of disclosure, revealing what kind of person one ought\nto be in contrast to the kind of person one has been. These acts\ndemonstrate that the person has become a more loving human being.\nTransformation, either for the individual or for a people, is\nmotivated by this moral ideal disclosed in the act of repentance.\n\nScheler describes this sense of transformation as a transformation\n\u201cfrom above\u201d (GW IV, 397). It is a rejection of what\nScheler takes to be the socialist form of transformation, a\ntransformation from below. What Scheler thinks is lacking in socialism\nand Marxism is a sense of the absolute value of the person. A\ntransformation from below, a transformation fueled by class conflict\nor other economic factors, fails to recognize the uniqueness and the\nvalue of each person. Such recognition is possible only at the\nspiritual or ideal level of insight. Socialism, according to Scheler,\nregards the person only in terms of the basic life values and\nconsequently seeks only to transform the given social and political\ncontext from this perspective, a perspective which treats all person\nas if they were the same.. A transformation from above takes the\nperson as the highest value and transforms the given conditions in\naccord with uniqueness of each and every individual.\n\nScheler is not interested in a revolution and at no time speaks of a\npossible overthrow of the existing governments in Germany or in\nEurope. The revolutionary act comes in the form of an act of\nresurgence in the community and the specific sense of responsibility\ndeveloped through the bonds of solidarity. Solidarity is the principle\nthat guides the generation of a Christian community and it is on this\nform of community that Scheler hopes to found a new Germany and Europe\n(GW VI, 264). In this second phase of Scheler\u2019s social and\npolitical thought, he was attracted to the manner by which the person\nas absolute value was realized in the bonds of solidarity. In\nsolidarity, a person comes to realize not only his or her\nco-responsibility for every member of the group, but also his or her\nunique calling to act on behalf of the good and the just. The bonds of\nsolidarity not only overcome the individualism of liberalism and the\nvalue reduction of socialism, but they also reveal the call to act and\nthus to participate in the social and political reconstruction.\n\n\u201cChristian democracy\u201d is the title Scheler gives to the\npolitical expression of the sense of solidarity he develops in the\nsecond phase of his social and political thought (GW IV,\n676\u2013687). Scheler does not return to this notion again, but it\ndoes isolate the three basic aspects of his political thought that\ngrew out of this period of his thought and that informed his later\nthought as well. These three aspects of Christian democracy are as\nfollows: (1) Each and every member is called to act by virtue of a\nsense of co-responsibility for every other member and for the group as\na whole, an expression of collective self-governance, (2) the basic\nvital needs and goods are provided to all, preserving the\nlife-community of a people, and (3) dignity and humility are the\ncentral virtues that preserve the radical uniqueness of each and every\nperson. A Christian democracy is a model of collective governance\nwherein each person is concerned about the basic welfare of all while\npromoting what makes each person unique. Or, in Scheler\u2019s words,\nit maintains an aristocracy \u201cin the heavens\u201d and a\ndemocracy \u201con earth\u201d (GW II, 500).\n\nThe beginning of the third phase in Scheler\u2019s social and\npolitical thought is marked by the publication of his work,\nProblems of a Sociology of Knowledge. Although this idea of a\nsociology of knowledge is a new approach for Scheler, it does not\nraise a new question. In this work, Scheler investigates the manner in\nwhich values and ideals determine the course of history, i.e., what is\nboth possible and actual for a culture. This is the same concern that\nScheler raised in his work on value theory. What is novel about his\nlater approach is an understanding of history as an interplay between\ntwo wholly distinct factors, real and ideal. Whereas Scheler\u2019s\nearlier work focused primarily on the ideal or on the role of values\nin history, the later work places much greater emphasis on the\nso-called \u201creal\u201d factors or drives of life. This change of\nemphasis was motivated in part by his disappointment with the\nreconstructive efforts immediately after the war and the recognition\nthat ideals and values are incapable on their own of instituting\nchange.\n\nThere are, for a human society, three basic real factors: family,\npolitics and economics. These three factors are rooted in the basic\nlife-drive structure of the human being. The family is rooted in the\nsex drive, politics \u2013 in the power drive and economics \u2013\nin the appetitive or the acquisition drive (GW VIII, 19). Life or\nexistence is a basic urge to be (Drang) and in the human\nbeing, this urge to be is expressed in terms of the three basic\ndrives. These drives are what makes all that is possible and in terms\nof the development of history, the drives are what makes history\npossible.\n\nIdeal factors are activities such as art, philosophy, science and\nreligion. These factors are rooted in spirit, a movement expressed in\neach human being that discloses the higher values and ideals. The\nideal factors enjoy a development independent of the real and have\ntheir own logic of development. The real or actual does not determine\nwhat is or what can be thought. Culture is the arena in which spirit\nunfolds, but this unfolding is particular to each and every culture.\nScheler adamantly rejects any idea of a world-spirit or eternal\nobjective logos directing the course of human history and of every\nculture (GW VIII, 27). There is, by the very nature of spirit itself,\na diversity of cultures, each having its own organizational structure\nand function (GW VIII, 25). The development of a culture rests on the\nparticular insights of its people and proceeds along the course\nparticular to that culture.\n\nWith respect to existence, however, the ideal factors are powerless.\nThey cannot on their own accord realize any idea or value. Their power\nlies in their ability to direct and channel the real factors of\nhistory. They are parasitic in this manner upon the real factors,\nhaving power only in so far as they are able to determine the course\nof the real factors. The life drives are what gives spirit its power\nto exist. History, therefore, takes place through the interplay of the\nreal and the ideal factors. Its course is determined by which ideas\nand values become dominant in directing the life drives.\n\nThis process of determining the real factors and realizing the ideal\nis the process of spiritualization and it defines the task of being\nhuman. A sociology of knowledge is an examination of how certain ideas\nand values have shaped the real factors, giving rise to diverse\nexpressions of the family, politics and economics. Politically,\nspiritualization is not only the process by which the drive to power\nis directed by the higher values of spirit, the transformation of\nphysical power into political power, but also an understanding that\nideas alone do not change the course of history. Politics is an\nactivity that engages the real and thus must unfold through action.\nThe loving bonds of solidarity may give rise to deeper insights\nregarding the value of a person, but these insights only come to have\nan effective force if they are realized in the acts of persons.\n\nThroughout his political writings, Scheler was prone to raising\nultimatums for Germany and Europe. During the events leading up to\nWorld War I, either Germany would fight for its and Europe\u2019s\ncultural dignity, or Europe would cease to exist. Immediately after\nthe war, it was once again an \u201ceither/or\u201d frame in terms\nof the existence of Europe: either Europe would generate itself again\nfrom the loving bonds of community and solidarity, or it would\ncollapse under the pressures of capitalism, liberalism and the\nmechanization of nature. Scheler never stopped fearing the destructive\nideals and values inherent to modernity. Yet, his greatest political\nfear was political indifference (GW XIII, 72). Indifference leads only\nto despotism, he writes, and with the looming threat of fascism\nthroughout Europe it was more important than ever for the people of\nEurope to act. Despite a history that only knows violence and war,\npeace remains a possibility. In his essay on the eternal ideal of\npeace, Scheler writes that peace is always a future possibility, but\nthat this eternal ideal will not realize itself. The realization of\npeace requires direct political action that must spring collectively\nfrom each and every member (GW XIII, 121). Scheler\u2019s mature\nsocial and political thought demonstrates the necessity of action and\nthe possible terror that will ensue when indifference and apathy\nbecome the cultural norm.\n",
