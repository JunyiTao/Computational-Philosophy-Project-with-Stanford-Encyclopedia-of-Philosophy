The issue here is whether the pleasure can produce\ndesire from itself. Kant admits that we have certain general\nconcerns with beauty that mean that desire may follow from a judgment\nof beauty, but according to Kant, such desires do not have their\nsource solely in pleasure in the beautiful (Kant 1790, sections 41 and\n42, on \u201cempirical interest\u201d and \u201cintellectual\ninterest). It may be that we have desires concerning beautiful things,\nas Kant allows in sections 41 and 42 of the Critique of\nJudgment, but so long as those desires are not intrinsic to the\npleasure in beauty, the doctrine that all pleasure in beauty is\ndisinterested is undisturbed. (Critics of Kant sometimes miss this\npoint.)\n\nThe less ambitious thesis is controversial because of the second\ncomponent. An opponent of Kant might claim, not implausibly, that\npleasure in beauty can produce desire by itself. It is not\nclear who is right on this point.\n\nMoreover, whether only pleasure in beauty is disinterested,\nand no other kind of pleasures are disinterested\u2014the ambitious\nthesis\u2014is also controversial. These are live issues.\nKant\u2019s views have much to be said for them. But we can also\nsympathize with those who are doubtful.\n\nHume would probably deny Kant\u2019s separation of pleasure in beauty\nfrom the motivations that lead us to act. Like other British\nsentimentalists, Hume thinks that sentiment and passion both fall on\nthe active side of the human mind. So, sentiments are active in\nthemselves. However, this aspect of the British sentimentalist views\nlooks like a general weakness since they have no convincing place for\na faculty of practical reason, and that means, in turn, that they lack\nany intelligible conception of human action (Korsgaard 1996, 2009).\nHume\u2019s psychology has no plausible understanding of human\nagency; we are pushed around by our passions.\n\nIn his Genealogy of Morals, Friedrich Nietzsche targets\nKant\u2019s separation of pleasure in beauty from desire, a\nseparation that is designed to make beauty available to all\nhuman beings (Nietzsche 1887 [1998], book 3, section 6, the first\npage, but not what follows, which targets Schopenhauer). This\ncriticism is distinct from criticism of the idea that judgments of\nbeauty are valid for all human beings. Nietzsche protests\nthat the idea of pleasure in beauty is cut-off from the\nparticularities and idiosyncrasies of our passionate lives is\nunrealistic and undesirable. It is not clear who is right here. The\nnub of the issue is the nature of pleasure in the beautiful. Does it\nhave its source in what Human beings share, or in what distinguishes\nthem? Kant might argue, against Nietzsche, that seeing pleasure in\nbeauty as springing from what varies between people, not only places\npeople at the mercy of their good or bad aesthetic upbringing, but\nalso makes untenable the normative claims to correctness or universal\nvalidity that are part of judgments of beauty, as we ordinarily\nconceive of them. \u201cOught\u201d, in this case, seems to imply\n\u201ccan\u201d. If we lack what it takes to appreciate a certain\nbeauty, then it cannot be required of us, and the normativity of the\njudgment of taste would be lost. Or so it seems. If judgments of\nbeauty were based on variable pleasures or displeasures, then it seems\nthat the claim to correctness is fraudulent.\n\nBut this only follows if we follow Kant in locating pleasure in\nbeauty, and our right to make judgments of beauty, in faculties that\nall human beings share. Perhaps there are rarefied beauties that only\nNietzsche\u2019s elite special souls can appreciate. For Kant, there\nis an aesthetic \u201cought\u201d that binds all human beings only\nbecause we share the cognitive faculties that it takes to have the\npleasure in question. But this is not the only conceivable source of\nthe aesthetic \u201cought\u201d. One non-Kantian suggestion would be\nto locate the source of normativity of the judgment of taste, in the\nworld, not in what human beings share. This would be to invoke a kind\nof \u201caesthetic realism\u201d, whereby beauty and ugliness are\ngenuine properties of the world, which make our judgments better or\nworse. That view might seem metaphysically extravagant. The trouble,\nthough, is how to understand the aesthetic \u201cought\u201d without\nthat kind of view. Not easy! On a realist view, beauty need not be\nuniversally available. But if so, it seems that the rationale for\nKant\u2019s doctrine(s) of disinterestedness falls away. The Kantian\nand perhaps Humean view locates the source of normativity in what we\nshare. But Nietzsche would ask: is there, and should there, be\nsomething that humans share in their responses to beauty? Do we want\naristocratic or democratic\n aesthetics?[3]\n",
