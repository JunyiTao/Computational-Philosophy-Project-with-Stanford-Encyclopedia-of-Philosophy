Although he received\nonly the basic training of a \u201cmagister\u201d and was\nprofessionally oriented towards theology at the beginning of his\ncareer, he rapidly became known for his mathematical skills and\ntheoretical creativity. As a convinced Copernican, Kepler was able to\ndefend the new system on different fronts: against the old astronomers\nwho still sustained the system of Ptolemy, against the Aristotelian\nnatural philosophers, against the followers of the new \u201cmixed\nsystem\u201d of Tycho Brahe\u2014whom Kepler succeeded as Imperial\nMathematician in Prague\u2014and even against the standard Copernican\nposition according to which the new system was to be considered merely\nas a computational device and not necessarily a physical reality.\nKepler\u2019s complete corpus can be hardly summarized as a\n\u201csystem\u201d of ideas like scholastic philosophy or the new\nCartesian systems which arose in the second half of the 17th century.\nNevertheless, it is possible to identify two main tendencies, one\nlinked to Platonism and giving priority to the role of geometry in the\nstructure of the world, the other connected with the Aristotelian\ntradition and accentuating the role of experience and causality in\nepistemology. While he attained immortal fame in astronomy because of\nhis three planetary laws, Kepler also made fundamental contributions\nin the fields of optics and mathematics. To the little-known facts\nregarding Kepler\u2019s indefatigable scientific activity belong his\nefforts to develop different technical devices, for instance, a water\npump, which he tried to patent and apply in different practical\ncontexts (for the documents, see KGW 21.2.2., pp. 509\u201357 and\n667\u2013691). To his contemporaries he was also a famous\nmathematician and astrologer; for his own part, he wanted to be\nconsidered a philosopher who investigated the innermost structure of\nthe cosmos scientifically.\n", "toc": [{"#LifWor": "1.

Life and Works\n\nJohannes Kepler was born on December 27, 1571 in Weil der Stadt, a\nlittle town near Stuttgart in W\u00fcrttemberg in southwestern\nGermany. Unlike his father Heinrich, who was a soldier and mercenary,\nhis mother Katharina was able to foster Kepler\u2019s intellectual\ninterests. He was educated in Swabia; firstly, at the schools Leonberg\n(1576), Adelberg (1584) and Maulbronn (1586); later, thanks to support\nfor a place in the famous T\u00fcbinger Stift, at the\nUniversity of T\u00fcbingen. Here, Kepler became Magister\nArtium (1591) before he began his studies in the Theological\nFaculty. At T\u00fcbingen, where he received a solid education in\nlanguages and in science, he met Michael Maestlin, who introduced him\nto the new world system of Copernicus (see Mysterium\nCosmographicum, trans. Duncan, p. 63, and KGW 20.1, VI, pp.\n144\u2013180).\n\nBefore concluding his theology studies at T\u00fcbingen, in\nMarch/April 1594 Kepler accepted an offer to teach mathematics as the\nsuccessor to Georg Stadius at the Protestant school in Graz (in\nStyria, Austria). During this period (1594\u20131600), he composed\nmany official calendars and prognostications and published his first\nsignificant work, the Mysterium Cosmographicum (= MC), which\ncatapulted him to fame overnight. On April 27, 1597 Kepler married his\nfirst wife, Barbara M\u00fcller von M\u00fchleck. As a consequence of\nthe anti-Protestant atmosphere in Graz and thanks also to the positive\nimpact of his MC on the scientific community, he abandoned Graz and\nmoved to Prague in 1600, to work under the supervision of the great\nDanish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546\u20131601). His first contact\nwith Tycho was, however, extremely traumatic, particularly because of\nthe Ursus affair (see below Section 4.1). After Tycho\u2019s\nunexpected death on October 1601 Kepler succeeded him as Imperial\nMathematician. During his time in Prague, Kepler was particularly\nproductive. He completed his most important optical works,\nAstronomiae pars optica (=APO) and\nDioptrice (=D), published several treatises on astrology\n(De fundamentis astrologiae certioribus, Antwort auf\nRoeslini Diskurs; Tertius interveniens), discussed\nGalileo\u2019s telescopic discoveries (Dissertatio cum nuncio\nsidereo), and composed his most significant astronomical work,\nthe Astronomia nova (=AN), which contains his first two laws\nof planetary motion.\n\nOn August 3, 1611 Kepler\u2019s wife, Barbara M\u00fcller, died. In\n1612 he moved to Linz, in Upper Austria, and became a professor at the\nLandschaftsschule. There, he served as Mathematician of the\nUpper Austrian Estates from 1612 to 1628. In 1613, he married Susanne\nReuttinger, with whom he had six children. In 1615, he completed the\nmathematical works Stereometria doliorum and Messekunst\nArchimedis. At the end of 1617 Kepler successfully defended his\nmother, who had been accused of witchcraft. In 1619 he published his\nprincipal philosophical work, the Harmonice mundi (=HM), and\nwrote, partially at the same time, the Epitome astronomiae\ncopernicanae (=EAC). In 1624 Kepler continued his investigations\non mathematics, publishing his work on logarithms (Chilias\nlogarithmorum\u2026).\n\nIn pursuit of an accurate printer for the Tabulae\nRudolphinae, he moved to Ulm near the end of 1626 and remained\nthere until the end of 1627. In July 1628 he went to Sagan to enter\nthe service of Albrecht von Wallenstein (1583\u20131634). He died on\nNovember 15, 1630 at Regensburg, where he was to present his financial\nclaims before the imperial authorities (for Kepler\u2019s life,\nCaspar\u2019s biography (1993) is still the best work. KGW 19\ncontains biographically relevant documents).\n2. Philosophy, theology, cosmology\n\nThere is probably no such thing as \u201cKepler\u2019s\nphilosophy\u201d in any pure form. Nevertheless, many attempts to\ndeal with the \u201cphilosophy of Kepler\u201d have been made, all\nof which are very valuable in their own way. Some studies have\nconcentrated on a particular text (see, for instance, Jardine 1988,\nfor the Defense of Tycho against Ursus), or have followed\nsome particular ideas of Kepler over a longer period of his life and\nscientific career (see, for instance, Martens 2000, on Kepler\u2019s\ntheory of the archetypes). Others have tried to determine from a\nphilosophical point of view his place in the development of the\nastronomical revolution from the 15th to the\n17th centuries (Koyr\u00e9 1957 and 1961) or in the more\ngeneral context of the scientific movement of the 17th\ncentury (Hall, 1963 and especially Burtt, 1924). Still others have\ndiscussed a long list of philosophical principles operating in\nKepler\u2019s scientific world, and have claimed to have found, by\nmeans of such an analysis, compelling evidence for the interaction\nbetween science, philosophy, and religion (Kozhamthadam, 1994). If, in\nthe particular case of Kepler, philosophy is immediately related to\nastronomy, mathematics and, finally, \u201ccosmology\u201d (a notion\nwhich arises much later), the core of these speculations is to be\nsought in the spectrum of problems with which he dealt in his\nMysterium Cosmographicum and Harmonice Mundi (on\nthis topic, Field 1988 is one of the most representative works on\nKepler). In addition, because of the particular circumstances of his\nlife and his fascinating personality and genius, the literature on\nKepler is extremely wide-ranging, covering a spectrum from literary\npieces like Max Brod\u2019s Tycho Brahes Weg zu Gott\n(1915)\u2014though still not free from mistakes concerning\nKepler\u2014to general introductions in the genre of historical\nnovels, and even fictional stories and charlatanry on astrology or,\nrunning for some years now, portraying him as the assassin of Tycho\nBrahe. However, according to recent reports, it is still a matter of\ncontroversy whether Tycho was assassinated at all (see the\n report at phys.org).\n\nKepler mastered, like the best scientists, the most complicated\ntechnical issues, especially in astronomy, but he always emphasized\nhis philosophical, even theological, approach to the questions he\ndealt with: God manifests himself not only in the words of the\nScriptures but also in the wonderful arrangement of the universe and\nin its conformity with the human intellect. Thus, astronomy represents\nfor Kepler, if done philosophically, the best path to God (see\nH\u00fcbner 1975; Methuen 1998 and 2009; Jardine 2009, Kirby 2019). As\nKepler at the core of his greatest astronomical work confesses (AN,\nPart II, chap. 7, KGW 6, p. 108, Engl. trans., p. 183), at the\nbeginning of his career he \u201cwas able to taste the sweetness of\nphilosophy \u2026 with no special interest whatsoever in\nastronomy.\u201d And, even in his later work, after having calculated\nmany ephemerides and different astronomical data, Kepler writes in a\nletter of February 17, 1619 to V. Bianchi: \u201cI also ask you, my\nfriends, that you do not condemn me to the treadmill of mathematical\ncalculations; allow me time for philosophical speculation, my only\ndelight!\u201d (KGW 17, let. N\u00b0 827, p. 327, lin. 249\u2013\n51).\n\nEspecially where Kepler deals with the geometrical structure of the\ncosmos, he always returns to his Platonic and Neoplatonic framework of\nthought. Thus, the polyhedral hypothesis (see Section 3 below) he\npostulated for the first time in his MC represents a kind of\n\u201cformal cause\u201d constituting the foundational structure of\nthe universe. In addition, an \u201cefficient cause,\u201d which\nrealizes this structure in the corporeal world, is also needed. This\nis, of course, God the Creator, who accomplished His work according to\nthe model of the five regular polyhedra. Kepler reinterprets the\ntraditional statements about the Creation as an image of the Creator\ngiving to the ancient ideas a more systematic and a quantitative\ncharacter. Even the doctrine of the Trinity could be geometrically\nrepresented, taking the center for the Father, the spherical surface\nfor the Son, and the intermediate space, which is mathematically\nexpressed in the regularity of the relationship between the point and\nthe surface, for the Holy Spirit. In Kepler\u2019s model, we have to\nbe able to reduce all appearances to straightness and curvature as\nproviding the foundation for the geometrical structure of the\nworld\u2019s creation. The very first category, through which God\nproduced a fundamental similitude of the created World to Himself, is\nthat of quantity (see MC, chapter 2, KGW pp. 23\u201326).\nFurthermore, quantity was also introduced into the human soul for the\nspecific purpose that this fundamental symmetry could be apprehended\nand known scientifically.\n\nThis kind of speculation also belongs to the basic principles of\nKepler\u2019s philosophical optics. In Chapter 1 of APO (\u201cOn\nthe Nature of Light\u201d), Kepler gives a new account of this\n\u201cTrinitarian Cosmogony.\u201d As he admits in a letter to\nThomas Harriot (1560\u20131621), his approach here is more\ntheological than optical (KGW 15, let. 394, p. 348, lin. 18). Similar\nto his speculations in MC, Kepler explains again the symmetry between\nGod and the Creation, but now he goes slightly beyond the limits of a\ntheologico-geometrical reflection. Firstly, he seems to assume that\nthe bodies of the world were provided in the Creation with some powers\nwhich enable them to exceed their geometrical limits and to act on\nother bodies (magnetic power is a good example of this). Secondly, the\nprinciple of symmetry introduced into matter constitutes \u201cthe\nmost excellent thing in the whole corporeal world, the matrix of the\nanimate faculties, and the chain linking the corporeal and spiritual\nworld\u201d (APO, Engl. trans., p. 19). Thirdly, as expressed by\nKepler in a wonderful, long Latin sentence, with multiple\nsubordinations, this principle \u201chas passed over into the same\nlaws (in leges easdem) by which the world was to be\nfurnished\u201d (ibid., p. 20; the original passage is in KGW 2, p.\n19: the marginal note in the edition is \u201clucis\nencomium\u201d). Finally, these reflections are concluded with a\nremark, in which\u2014as with Copernicus, Marsilio Ficino, and\nothers\u2014the central position of the Sun is legitimated because of\nits function in spreading light and, indirectly, life. Similar\nspeculations are still present in EAC (KGW 7, pp. 47\u201348 and\n267). It is also worth noting that these speculations are of vital\nimportance to the special way in which Kepler conceived of astrology\n(see, for instance, De fundamentis astrologiae certioribus\nwith Engl. trans. and commentary in Field 1984).\n3. The five regular solids\n\nPhilosophical, geometrical and even theological speculations related\nto the five regular polyhedra, the cube or hexahedron, the\ntetrahedron, the octahedron, the icosahedron and the dodecahedron,\nwere known at least from the time of the ancient Pythagoreans. Since\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus, these five geometrical solids played a\nleading role, and for the later tradition they became known as the\n\u201cfive Platonic solids\u201d.\n\n\nFigure 1.\nTable 3 in Mysterium Cosmographicum, with Kepler\u2019s\nmodel illustrating the intercalation of the five regular solids\nbetween the imaginary spheres of the planets (cf. KGW 1,\npp. 26\u201327).\n\n\nPlato establishes at the physical and chemical level a correspondence\nbetween them and the five elements\u2014earth, water, air, fire and\nether\u2014and tries to provide this correspondence with geometrical\ngrounds. A further source of historically decisive importance is the\nfact that the five regular polyhedra are treated in Euclid\u2019s\nElements of Geometry, a work that for Kepler, especially in\nthe Platonic approach of Proclus, has a central position. At the very\nbeginning of HM Kepler complains about the fact that the modern\nphilosophical and mathematical school of Peter Ramus (1515\u20131572)\nhad not been able to understand the architectonic structure of the\nElements, which are crowned with the treatment of the five\nregular polyhedra. In addition, a revival of Platonic philosophy was\ntaking place in Kepler\u2019s time and inspired not only philosophers\nand mathematicians but also architects, artists and illustrators (see\nField 1997).\n\nAmidst this general interest in the regular polyhedra during the\nRenaissance, Kepler was specifically concerned with their application\nin the resolution of a cosmological problem, namely the reality of the\nCopernican system (see Section 5 below). To achieve this goal, he\nintroduced his polyhedral hypothesis already in MC, where he looked\nfor an \u201ca priori\u201d foundation of the Copernican system (see\nAiton 1977, Di Liscia 2009). The background for such an approach seems\nto be that the \u201ca posteriori\u201d way, which according to\nKepler was taken over by Copernicus himself, cannot lead to a\nnecessary affirmation of the reality of the new world system, but only\nto a probable, and hence to an \u201cinstrumental\u201d,\nrepresentation of it as a computational device. This is the\n\u201cOsiander\u201d or \u201cWittenberg Interpretation\u201d of\nCopernicus which Kepler directly attacked not only in his MC but also\nlater in his AN (see Westman 1972, 1975 and 2011). In MC, he claimed\nto have found an answer to the following three main questions: 1) the\nnumber of the planets; 2) the size of the orbits, i.e., the distances;\n3) the velocities of the planets in their orbits. By referring to the\npolyhedral hypothesis (see Figure 1), Kepler found a definitive and\nsimple answer to the first question. By intercalating the polyhedra\nbetween the spheres which carry the planets, one must inevitably\nfinish with the sphere of Saturn surrounding the cube\u2014there are\nno more polyhedra to be intercalated and, as remains the standard case\nfor Renaissance and modern astronomy, there are no more planets to be\ncarried by the spheres. It is absolutely decisive for the consistency\nof the argument that the necessity of the hypothesis is guaranteed by\nthe fact that it already exists as a mathematical demonstration (by\nEuclid, Elements XIII, prop. 18, schol.), according to which\nthere are only five regular (\u201cPlatonic\u201d for the tradition)\npolyhedra. For the second and third questions the answer is, of\ncourse, not as evident as for the first one. However, Kepler was able\nto show that distances which are derived from the geometrical model of\nthe five regular bodies fit much better with the Copernican system\nthan with that of Ptolemy. The answer to the third question needs, in\naddition, the introduction of a notion of power that emanates from the\nSun and extends to the outer limit of the universe (see Stephenson\n1987, pp. 9\u201320).\n\nIn HM, Kepler continues his investigations of the polyhedra at a\ncosmological as well as a mathematical level. In the second book,\ndealing with \u201ccongruence\u201d (which here does not mean, as it\ndoes today, \u201cthe same size and shape\u201d, but the property of\nfigures filling the surface together with other regular polygons\n\u2013 on the plane\u2014or, to build closed geometric solids\n\u2013 hence, in space), Kepler made new mathematical discoveries\nworking with tessellations. He discovered two new solids, the\nso-called \u201csmall and great stellated dodecahedrons\u201d.\n\nThe treatment of the regular polyhedra constitutes one of the two\nprincipal pillars of HM, Book 5 (chapters 1\u20132), where the third\nlaw is formulated (see Caspar in KGW 6, Nachbericht, p. 497, and Engl.\ntrans. p. xxxiii). Following his approach from MC and complementing it\nwith occasional references to his EAC, Kepler makes use again of the\nPlatonic solids to determine the number of the planets and their\ndistances from the Sun. Meanwhile, he has learned that the application\nof his old polyhedral hypothesis has limits. As he tells us in a\nfootnote in the second edition of his MC from 1621, he was earlier\nconvinced of the possibility of explaining the eccentricities of the\nplanetary orbits by values derived \u201ca priori\u201d from this\nhypothesis (MC, Engl. trans., p. 189). Now, with access to the\nobservational data of Tycho, Kepler had to exclude this explanation\nand look for another. And this is one of the most significant\nachievements of his basic harmonies (which in turn are derived from\nthe regular polygons), constituting the second great pillar of Book\n5.\n4. Epistemology and philosophy of sciences\n\nAlmost all of Kepler\u2019s scientific investigations reflect a\nphilosophical background, and many of his philosophical questions find\ntheir final answer, even if they are of scientific interest, in the\nrealm of theology. From a very modern point of view, one could\nhighlight Kepler\u2019s epistemological thought in terms of four\ndifferent items: realism; causality; his philosophy of mathematics;\nand his\u2014own particular\u2014empiricism.\n4.1 Realism\n\nRealism is a constant and integral part of Kepler\u2019s thought, and\none which appears in sophisticated form from the outset. The reason\nfor this is that his realism always runs parallel to his defense of\nthe Copernican worldview, which appeared from his first public\npronouncements and publications.\n\nMany of Kepler\u2019s thoughts about epistemology can be found in his\nDefense of Tycho against Ursus or Contra Ursum\n(=CU), a work which emerged from a polemical framework, the plagiarism\nconflict between Nicolaus Raimarus Ursus (1551\u20131600) and Tycho\nBrahe: causality and physicalization of astronomical theories, the\nconcept and status of astronomical hypotheses, the polemic\n\u201crealism-instrumentalism\u201d, his criticism of skepticism in\ngeneral, the epistemological role of history, etc. It is one of the\nmost significant works ever written on this subject and is sometimes\ncompared with Bacon\u2019s Novum organum and\nDescartes\u2019 Discourse on Method (Jardine 1988, p. 5; for\nan excellent new edition and complete study of this work see Jardine /\nSegonds 2008).\n\nThe focus of the epistemological issues could be ranked mutatis\nmutandi with modern discussion surrounding the scientific status\nof astronomical theories (however, as Jardine has pointed out, it\nwould be sounder to read Kepler\u2019s CU more as a work against\nskepticism than in the context of the modern realism/instrumentalism\npolemic). For Pierre Duhem (1861\u20131916), for instance, the\nposition of Andreas Osiander, which was adopted by Ursus and which\nwas, according to Duhem, naively criticized by Kepler in his MC,\nrepresents the modern approach known as \u201cinstrumentalism\u201d.\nAccording to this epistemological position, held by Duhem himself,\nscientific theories are not to be closely linked to the concepts of\ntruth and falsehood. Hypotheses and scientific laws are nothing more\nthan \u201cinstruments\u201d for describing and predicting phenomena\n(seldom for explaining them). The aim of physical theories is not to\noffer a causal explanation or to study the causes of phenomena, but\nsimply to represent them. In the best-case scenario, theories are able\nto order and classify what is decisive for their predictive capacity\n(Duhem 1908, 1914).\n\nContrary to Tycho and Kepler, Ursus held a fictionalist position in\nastronomy. Yet in the very beginning of his work De\nhypothesibus, Ursus makes a clear declaration about the nature of\nastronomical theories, which is very similar to the approach suggested\nby Osiander in his forward to Copernicus\u2019 De\nrevolutionibus: a hypothesis is a \u201cfictitious\nsupposition\u201d, introduced just for the sake of \u201csaving the\nmotions of the heavenly bodies\u201d and to \u201ccalculate\nthem\u201d (trans. Jardine 1988, p. 41)\n\nFollowing his approach in MC and anticipating the opening pages of his\nlater AN (see particularly AN, II.21: \u201cWhy, and to what extent,\nmay a false hypothesis yield the truth?\u201d Engl. trans., pp.\n294\u2013301), Kepler addresses the question of Copernicanism and its\nreception by thinkers such as Osiander, who emphasized that the truth\nof astronomical hypotheses cannot necessarily be deduced from the\ncorrect prediction of astronomical facts. According to this\ninterpretation, Copernican hypotheses are not necessarily true even if\nthey are able to save the phenomena, otherwise one would commit a\nfallacia affirmationis consequentis. However, according to\nKepler, \u201cthis happens only by chance and not always, but only\nwhen the error in the one proposition meets another proposition,\nwhether true or false, appropriate for eliciting the truth\u201d\n(trans. Jardine, p. 140). To be noted is that, as Jardine (2005, p.\n137) has pointed out, the modern scientific realist departs from a\nreal independent world, while Kepler\u2019s notion of truth\npresupposes that neither nature nor the human mind are independent of\nGod\u2019s mind (Jardine 2005, p. 137).\n4.2 Causality\n\nThe reality of astronomical hypotheses\u2014and hence the superiority\nof the Copernican world system\u2014implied a physicalization of\nastronomical theories and, in turn, an accentuation of causality.\nDespite Kepler\u2019s criticism of Aristotle, this aspect can\nactually be considered the realization in the field of astronomy of\nthe old Aristotelian ideal of knowledge: \u201cknowledge\u201d means\nto grasp the causes of the phenomena.\n\nThus, on the one hand, \u201ccausality\u201d is a notion implying\nthe most general idea of \u201cactual scientific knowledge\u201d\nwhich guides and stimulates each investigation. In this sense, Kepler\nalready embarked in his MC on a causal investigation by asking for the\ncause of the number, the sizes and the \u201cmotions\u201d\n(= the speeds) of the heavenly spheres (see Section 3 above).\n\nOn the other hand, \u201ccausality\u201d implies in Kepler,\naccording to the Aristotelian conception of physical science, the\nconcrete \u201cphysical cause\u201d, the efficient cause which\nproduces a motion or is responsible for keeping the body in motion.\nOriginal to Kepler, however, and typical of his approach is the\nresoluteness with which he was convinced that the problem of\nequipollence of the astronomical hypotheses can be resolved and the\nconsequent introduction of the concept of causality into astronomy\n\u2013 traditionally a mathematical science. This approach is already\npresent in his MC, where he, for instance, relates for the first time\nthe distances of the planets to a power which emerges\nfrom the Sun and decreases in proportion to the distance of each\nplanet, up to the sphere of the fixed stars (see Stephenson 1987, pp.\n9\u201310).\n\nOne of Kepler\u2019s decisive innovations in his MC is that he\nreplaced the \u201cmean Sun\u201d of Copernicus with the real Sun,\nwhich was no longer merely a geometrical point but a body capable of\nphysically influencing the surrounding planets. In addition, in notes\nto the 1621 edition of MC Kepler strongly criticizes the notion of\n\u201csoul\u201d (anima) as a dynamical factor in planetary\nmotion and proposes to substitute \u201cforce\u201d (vis)\nfor it (see KGW 8, p. 113, Engl. trans. p. 203, note 3).\n\nOne of the most important philosophical aspects of Kepler\u2019s\nAstronomia Nova from 1609 (=AN) is its methodological\napproach and its causal foundation (see Mittelstrass 1972). Kepler was\nsufficiently conscious of the change of perspective he was introducing\ninto astronomy. Hence, he decided to announce this in the full title\nof the work: Astronomia Nova, Aitiologetos, seu physica coelestis,\ntradita commentariis de motibus stellae Martis. Ex observationibus G.\nV. Tychonis Brahe: New Astronomy Based upon Causes or\nCelestial Physics Treated by Means of Commentaries on the Motions of\nthe Star Mars from the observations of Tycho Brahe \u2026\n(trans. Donahue). In the introduction to AN Kepler insists on his\nradical change of view: his work is about physics, not pure\nkinematical or geometrical astronomy. \u201cPhysics\u201d, as in the\ntraditional, Aristotelian understanding of the discipline, deals with\nthe causes of phenomena, and for Kepler that constitutes his ultimate\napproach to deciding between rival hypotheses (AN, Engl. trans., p.\n48; see Krafft 1991). On the other hand, since his celestial physics\nuses not only geometrical axioms but also other, non-mathematical\naxioms, the knowledge obtained often has a kernel of guesswork.\n\nIn the third part of AN, chapters 22\u201340, Kepler deals with the\npath of the Earth and intends to offer a physical account of the\nCopernican theory. By so doing he includes the idea that a certain\nnotion of power should be made responsible for the regulation of the\ndifferences in velocities of the planets, which in turn have to be\nestablished in relation to the planets\u2019 distances. Now, the\nCopernican planetary theory departs from the general principle that\nthe Earth moves regularly on an eccentric circle. For Kepler, on the\ncontrary, the planets are moved irregularly, and the slower they are\nmoved, the greater their distance is from the center of power, the\nSun. Addressing the physical aspects of his new astronomy, he deals in\nchapters 32\u201340, perhaps the most idiosyncratic of the work, with\nhis notion of motive power. Here, he combines different approaches and\nsources, sometimes producing\u2014for the purpose of simplifying the\nwhole geometrical construction of geometrical astronomy by introducing\na power causing motions\u2014a new confusion at the dynamical level.\nTo begin with, it is not always absolutely clear what kind of power\nKepler has in mind. He inclines, above all, to the idea of a magnetic\npower residing in the Sun, but he also mentions light and, at least\nindirectly, gravity (which he does not bring into operation in the\ncentral chapters of the AN but which is to a certain extent implied in\nhis explanations using the model of the balance and which he surely\naccepts as true for the Sun-Moon system, as he explains in the general\nintroduction). Secondly, it is not always clear what this power is and\nhow it acts, especially when he is speaking merely analogically,\n\u201cas if\u201d (particularly in the case of light). Essentially,\nKepler breaks down the motions of the planets into two components. On\nthe one hand, the planets move around the Sun\u2014at this state of\nthe discussion\u2014circularly. On the other hand, they exhibit a\nlibration on the Sun-planet vector. The rotation of the Sun is\nresponsible for the motion of the planets. Irradiating from the\nrotating Sun is a power which spreads at the ecliptic plain. This\npower diminishes with distance to the source of the power, that is, to\nthe Sun. A decisive work for Kepler\u2019s development in his\nphysical astronomy is William Gilbert\u2019s (1544\u20131603) De\nmagnete (London, 1600), a work which also intends to offer a new\nphysics for the new Copernican cosmology and which surely influenced\nKepler\u2019s thoughts about this power. One of the main problems\nwas, of course, how to apply the general principles of magnetism to\nplanetary motion, first to explain the difference in velocity on a\ncircular path, and later to give an account of the motion on an\nellipse. Kepler conceives of a model with parallel magnetic fibers\nwhich links the Sun with the planets in such a way that the rotation\nof the Sun causes the motion of the planets around it. The fibers are\nborn in the planets parallel and perpendicular to the lines of apsides\nby a kind of \u201canimal power\u201d. The planets themselves are\npolarized, that is, with one pole they are attracted to the Sun, with\nthe other pole they are pushed away from it. This explains very well\nthe direction of planetary motion: the planets all move in one\ndirection because the Sun rotates in that direction.\nNevertheless, a further problem still seems to remain unresolved:\naccording to Kepler\u2019s explication, the planets should move\naround the Sun as fast as the Sun itself rotates, which is not the\ncase. This phenomenon can be explained by referring to a property of\nmatter, which for Kepler has an axiomatic character: the\ninclinatio ad quietem, that is, the tendency to rest (see\nespecially AN, chap. 39; KGW 3, p. 256). As a consequence, the planets\nare moved around the Sun slower than they would be if the power of the\nSun were at work alone.\n\nKepler\u2019s causal approach is above all present in his\nEpitome, a voluminous work which exercised a considerable\ninfluence on the later development of astronomy. In the second part of\nBook 4, he deals with the motion of the world\u2019s parts. Not the\ntwo first laws but rather the third law, which he had recently\nannounced in his HM, is Kepler\u2019s starting point; for this law,\nrather than a calculational device for the path of one planet,\nrepresents a general cosmological statement, and thus it is more\nconvenient for his approach here. At the same time, it should be\npointed out that the third law is not necessarily the best point of\ndeparture for a dynamical, causal approach to motion, as Kepler\nintends here; for, in comparison with the previous causal approaches,\nthe question of the location of the cause of power responsible for the\nproduction of motion remains relevant. The spheres, which in the\ntraditional view transported the planets, had been abolished since the\ntime of Tycho. Furthermore, Kepler is clearly against the\n\u201cmoving intelligences\u201d of the Aristotelian tradition. The\nfact that the orbits are elliptical and not circular, shows that the\nmotions are not caused by a spiritual power but rather by a natural\none, which is internal to the composition of matter. The planets\nthemselves are provided with \u201cinertia\u201d, a\nproperty, as Kepler understood it, that inhibits motion and represents\nan impediment to it. The motive power (vix motrix) comes\nindeed from the Sun, which sends its rays of light and power in all\ndirections. These rays are captured by the planets. Kepler, however,\ntries to explain this behavior of the planets less through astrology\nand much more through magnetism (a physical phenomenon which was by no\nmeans clearly understood in his time). Firstly, the Sun rotates and,\nby so doing, sets in motion the planets around it. Secondly, since the\nplanets are poles of magnets and the Sun itself acts with magnetic\npower, the planets are, at different parts of their orbits, either\nattracted or repelled; in this way the elliptical path is causally\nproduced. Kepler partially gives up the mechanical approach by\npostulating a soul in the Sun which is responsible for its regular\nmotion of rotation, a motion on which, finally, the entire system\ndepends. In fact, the planets are also supposed by Kepler to rotate\nand are therefore provided with \u201ca sort of soul\u201d or some\nsuch principle which produces the rotation.\n\nIn addition to astronomy and cosmology Kepler expanded his causal\napproach to include the fields of optics (see Section 6 below) and\nharmonics (Section 7 below).\n4.3 Philosophy of mathematics\n\nBeyond his own original talent, it is clear that Kepler was trained in\nmathematics from his earliest studies at T\u00fcbingen. At least\nofficially, his positions at Graz, Prague, Linz, Ulm and Sagan can be\ncharacterized as the typical professional occupations of a\nmathematician in the broadest sense, i.e., including astrology and\nastronomy, theoretical mechanics and pneumatics, metrology, and every\ntopic that could in some way be related to mathematics. Besides the\nfield of astronomy and optics, where mathematics is ordinarily applied\nin different ways, Kepler produced original contributions to the\ntheory of logarithms and above all within his favorite field, geometry\n(especially with his stereometrical investigations. For the medieval\nproportions theory as a background for Kepler's logarithms, see\nRommevaux-Tani, 2018). Thus, on account of his natural predilection\nand talent and the importance of mathematics, particularly of\ngeometry, for his thought, it is not surprising to find many different\npassages in his works where he articulated his philosophy of\nmathematics. However, Kepler\u2019s principal exposition on this\ntopic is to be found in his HM, a work in which the first two books\nare purely mathematical in content. As he himself declares, in HM he\nplayed the role \u201cnot of a geometer in philosophy but of a\nphilosopher in this part of geometry\u201d (KGW 6, p. 20, Engl.\ntrans., p. 14).\n\nWhile in philosophical questions related to mathematics, Proclus and\nPlato were Kepler\u2019s most important inspirational sources, he did\nnot always see Plato and Aristotle as completely opposed, for the\nlatter\u2014in Kepler\u2019s interpretation\u2014also accepted\n\u201ca certain existence of the mathematical entities\u201d (KGW\n14, let. N\u00b0 226, p. 265; see Peters, p. 130). To a great extent\nKepler understood his mathematical investigations of HM as a\ncontinuation of Euclid\u2019s Elements, especially of the\nanalysis of irrationalities in Book 10. The central notion that he\nworks out here is that of \u201cconstructability\u201d. According to\nKepler, each branch of knowledge must, in principle, be reducible to\ngeometry if it is to be accepted as knowledge in the strong sense\n(although, in the case of the physics, this condition is, as the AN\nemphasizes, only a necessary and not a sufficient condition). Thus,\nthe new principles he was elaborating over the years in astrology were\ngeometrical ones. A similar case occurs with the basic notions of\nharmony, which, after Kepler, could be reduced to geometry. Of course,\nnot every geometrical statement is equally relevant and equally\nfundamental. For Kepler, the geometrical entities, principles and\npropositions which are especially fundamental are those that can be\nconstructed in the classical sense, i.e., using only ruler (without\nmeasurement units) and compass. On this are based further notions\naccording to different degrees of \u201cknowability\u201d\n(scibilitas), which begins with the circle and its diameter.\nOnce again, Kepler understood this within the framework of his\ncosmological and theological philosophy: geometry, and especially\ngeometrically constructible entities, have a higher meaning than other\nkinds of knowledge because God has used them to delineate and to\ncreate this perfect harmonic world. From this point of view, it is\nclear that Kepler defends a Platonist conception of mathematics, that\nhe cannot assume the Aristotelian theory of abstraction and that he is\nnot able to accept algebra, at least in the way he understood it. So,\nfor instance, there are figures that cannot be constructed\n\u201cgeometrically\u201d, although they are often assumed as safe\ngeometrical knowledge. The best example of this is perhaps the\nheptagon. This figure cannot be described outside of the circle, and\nin the circle its sides have, of course, a determinate magnitude, but\nthis is not knowable. Kepler himself says that this is important\nbecause here he finds the explanation for why God did not use such\nfigures to structure the world. Consequently, he devotes many pages to\ndiscussing the issue (KGW 6, Prop. 45, pp. 47\u201356, see also KGW\n9, p. 147). Certainly for a geometer like Kepler, approximations\nconstitute \u2013 as mathematical theory\u2014a painful and\nprecarious way to progress. The philosophical background for his\nrejection of algebra seems to be, at least partially, Aristotelian in\nsome of its basic suppositions: geometrical quantities are continuous\nquantities which therefore cannot be treated with numbers that are, in\nthe inverse, discrete quantities. But the difference from the\nAristotelian ideal of science remains an important one: for Aristotle,\na crossover between arithmetic and geometry is allowed only in the\ncase of the \u201cmiddle sciences\u201d, while for Kepler all\nknowledge must be reduced to its geometrical foundations. Recent\nresearch has tried to show that Kepler has followed the criteria of a\n\u201cPythagorean methodology\u201d when studying the phenomena of\nlight refraction. This would be evident in Kepler\u2019s application\nof the principle of \u201csameness is knowable by sameness\u201d\nand, additionally, in his tendency to avoid the infinite or, rather,\nto set limits to infinite magnitudes (Cardona Su\u00e1rez 2016).\n4.4 Empiricism\n\nA general presentation of Kepler\u2019s philosophical attitude and\nprinciples is not complete without reference to his link to the world\nof experience. For, despite his mainly theoretical approach in the\nnatural sciences, Kepler often emphasized the significance of\nexperience and, in general, of empirical data. In his correspondence\nthere are many remarks about the significance of observation and\nexperience, as for instance in a letter to Herwart von Hohenburg from\n1598 (KGW 13, let. N\u00b0 91, lines 150\u2013152) or from 1603 to\nFabricius (KGW 14, let. N\u00b0 262, p. 191, lines 129\u2013130), to\nmention only two of his most important correspondents. Looking for\nempirical support for the Copernican system, Kepler compares different\nastronomical tables in his MC, and in AN he makes extensive use of\nTycho\u2019s observational treasure trove. In MC (chapter 18) he\nquotes a long passage from Rheticus for the sake of rhetorical support\nwhen, as was the case here, the data of the tables he used did not fit\nperfectly with the calculated values from the polyhedral hypothesis.\nIn this passage, the reader learns that the great Copernicus, whose\nworld system Kepler defends in MC, said one day to Rheticus that it\nmade no sense to insist on absolute agreement with the data, because\nthese themselves were surely not perfect. After all, it is\nquestionable whether Kepler, using for instance the Prutenic\nTables (1551) of Erasmus Reinhold (1511\u20131553), had access\nto complete and correct empirical information to confirm the\nCopernican hypothesis in grand style, as he claimed (for an analysis\nof Reihold\u2019s tables and their influence see Gingerich 1993, pp.\n205\u2013255).\n\nThe situation changed completely when Kepler came into contact at\nPrague with Tycho\u2019s observations (which, as Kepler often\nreports, were seldom at his disposal). However, a change of attitude\nis evident in AN, where he used Tycho\u2019s observations without\nrestriction (which is something he makes clear in the work\u2019s\ntitle). In part 2 (chap. 7\u201321), he presents the \u201cvicarious\nhypothesis\u201d, which in the end he refutes. This hypothesis\nrepresents the best result which can be reached within the limits of\ntraditional astronomy. This works with circular orbits and with the\nsupposition that the motion of a planet appears regular from a point\non the lines of apsides. Against the traditional method, here, Kepler\ndoes not cut the eccentricity into equal parts but leaves the\npartition open. To check his hypothesis, he needs observations of Mars\nin opposition, where Mars, the Earth, and the Sun are at midnight on\nthe same line. From Tycho, he \u201cinherited\u201d ten such\nobservations between the years 1580 and 1600, and to them he added\nanother two for 1602 and 1604. In chapters 17\u201321, Kepler carries\nout an observational and computational check of his vicarious\nhypothesis. On the one hand, he points out that this hypothesis is\ngood enough, since the variations of the calculated positions from the\nobserved positions fall within the limits of acceptability (2 minutes\nof arc). In fact, Kepler presents this hypothesis as the best\nhypothesis which can be proposed within the framework of a\n\u201ctraditional astronomy\u201d, as opposed to his new astronomy,\nwhich he will offer in the following parts of the work. On the other\nhand, this hypothesis can be falsified if one takes the observations\nof the latitudes into consideration. Further calculations with these\nobservations produce a difference of eight minutes, something that\ncannot be assumed because the observations of Tycho are reliable\nenough. Kepler\u2019s famous sentence runs: \u201cthese eight\nminutes alone will have led the way to the reformation of all of\nastronomy\u201d (AN, KGW 3, p. 286; Engl. trans., p. 286). There\nseems to be agreement that Kepler\u2019s AN contains the first\nexplicit consideration of the problem of observational error (for this\nquestion see Hon 1987 and Field 2005).\n\nKepler also gave an important place to experience in the field of\noptics. As a matter of fact, he began his research on optics because\nof a disagreement between theory and observation, and he made use of\nscientific instruments he had designed himself (see, for instance, KGW\n21.1, p. 244). Recent research on the problem of the camera\nobscura and the \u201cimages in the air\u201d shows, however,\nthe limits of a traditional approach to Kepler\u2019s optics\nfollowing the main current of the history of physics. Rather, his\nnotion of experimentum needs to be contextualized within the\nsocial practices and epistemological commitments of his time (see\nDupr\u00e9 2008).\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that a similar significance is\nassigned to experience and empirical data in Kepler\u2019s\nharmonic-musical and astrological theories, two fields which are\nsubordinated to his greater cosmological project of HM. For astrology,\nhe uses meteorological data, which he recorded for many years, as\nconfirmation material. This material shows that the Earth, as a whole\nliving being, reacts to the aspects which occur regularly in the\nheavens (see Boner 2013, pp. 69\u201399). In his musical theory Kepler was\na modern thinker, especially because of the role he gave to\nexperience. As has been noted (Walker, 1978, p. 48), Kepler made\nacoustic experiments with a monochord long before he wrote his HM. In\na letter to Herwart von Hohenburg (KGW 15, ep. 424, p. 450), he\ndescribes how he checked the sound of a string at different lengths,\nestablishing in which cases the ear judges the sound to be\npleasurable. Kepler does not accept that this limitation is founded on\narithmetical speculations, even if this was already assumed by Plato,\nwhom he often follows, and by the Pythagoreans. On the basis of his\nexperiments, Kepler found that there are other divisions of the string\nthat the ear perceives as consonant, i.e., thirds and sixths.\n\nIf cosmology is the main framework of Kepler\u2019s interest, there\nis no doubt that, as Field has pointed out, he \u201cfelt the need to\nseek observational support for his model of the Universe\u201d (Field\n1988, p. 28; see also Field 1982).\n5. Copernicanism reformed and the three planetary laws\n\nToday Kepler is remembered in the history of sciences above all for\nhis three planetary laws, which he produced in very specific contexts\nand at different times. While it is questionable whether he would have\nunderstood these scientific statements as \u201claws\u201d\u2014and\nit is even arguable that he used this term with a different meaning\nthan we do today\u2014it seems to be clear that all three laws (as a\nlinguistic convention, we may continue to use the term) suppose some\nfundamentals of Kepler\u2019s philosophy: (a) realism, (b) causality,\n(c) the geometric structure of the cosmos. Besides this, it should be\nremarked that the common denominator of all three laws is\nKepler\u2019s defense of the Copernican worldview, a cosmological\nsystem which he was not able to defend without reforming it radically.\nIt is noteworthy that already at the very beginning of his career\nKepler vehemently defended the reality of the Copernican worldview in\na way that he characterized, taking over the terminology from the\nstandard Aristotelian epistemology, as \u201ca priori\u201d (see\nabove Section 3 above and Di Liscia 2009).\n\n\nFigure 2. \nKepler\u2019s first law of ellipse and second law of areas (modern\nrepresentation with greatly exaggerated eccentricity).\n\n\nThe first two laws were published initially in AN (1609), although it\nis known that Kepler had arrived at these results much earlier. His\nfirst law establishes that the orbit of a planet is an ellipse with\nthe Sun in one of the foci (see Figure 2). According to the second\nlaw, the radius vector from the Sun to a planet P sweeps out equal\nareas, for instance \\(SP_1P_2\\) and \\(SP_3P_4\\), in equal times. The\nplanet P is therefore faster at perihelion, where it is\ncloser to the Sun, and slower at aphelion, where it is farther from\nthe Sun. In accordance with his dynamical approach, Kepler first found\nthe second law and, then, as a further result because of the effect\nproduced by the supposed force, the elliptical path of the planets\n(for the two first planetary laws see especially Aiton 1973, 1975a,\nDavis 1992a\u2013e, and 1998a; Donahue 1994; Wilson 1968 and 1972; for\nKepler\u2019s system of conics in connection with his optics see the\nrecent study by Del Centina, 2016).\n\nPerhaps the most significant impact of Kepler\u2019s two laws can be\nfound by considering their cosmological consequences. The first law\nabolishes the old axiom of the circular orbits of the planets, an\naxiom which was still valid not only for pre-Copernican astronomy and\ncosmology but also for Copernicus himself, and for Tycho and Galileo.\nThe second law breaks with another axiom of traditional astronomy,\naccording to which the motion of the planets is uniform in swiftness.\nThe Ptolemaic tradition in astronomy was, of course, aware of this\ndifficulty and applied a particularly effective device for saving the\n\u201cappearance\u201d of acceleration: the equant. Copernicus, for\nhis own part, insisted on the necessity of the axiom of uniform\ncircular motion. Ptolemy\u2019s equant was understood by Copernicus\nas a technical device based on the violation of this axiom. Kepler, on\nthe contrary, affirms the reality of changes in the velocities of the\nplanetary motions and provides a physical account for them. After\nstruggling strenuously with established ideas which were located not\nonly in the tradition before him but also in his own thinking, Kepler\nabandoned the circular path of planetary motion and in this way\ninitiated a more empirical approach to cosmology (though see\nBrackenridge 1982).\n\nKepler published the third law, the so-called \u201charmonic\nlaw\u201d, for the first time in his Harmonice mundi (1619),\ni.e., ten years later. In his Epitome, he provided a more\nsystematic approach to all three laws, their grounds and implications\n(see Davis 2003; Stephenson 1987). In Book 5, chapter 3, as point 8 of\n13 (KGW 6, p. 302; Engl. trans., pp. 411\u201312), Kepler expresses,\nalmost accidentally, his fundamental relationship connecting elapsed\ntimes with distances, which in modern notation could be expressed\nas:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{a_1}{a_2}\\right)^3\n\\]\n\n\nwith \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) representing the periodic times of two\nplanets and \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\) the length of their semi-major axes. A\nfurther formulation of this relationship, which is often found in the\nliterature, is: \\(a^3/T^2 = K\\), which expresses with \\(K\\) that\nthe relationship between the third power of the distances and the\nsquare of the times is a constant (however, see Davis 2005,\npp. 171\u2013172; for the third planetary law see especially\nStephenson 1987). As a consequence of the third law, the time a planet\ntakes to travel around the Sun will significantly increase the farther\naway it is or the longer the radius of its orbit. Thus, for instance,\nSaturn\u2019s sidereal period is almost 30 years, while Mercury needs\nfewer than 88 days to go around the Sun. For the history of cosmology,\nit is important to make clear that the third law fulfils\nKepler\u2019s search for a\nsystematic representation and defense of the Copernican\nworldview, in which planets are not absolutely independent of each\nother but integrated in a harmonic world system.\n6. Optics and metaphysics of light\n\nKepler contributed to the special field of optics with two seminal\nworks, the Ad Vitellionem paralipomena (=APO) and\nthe Dioptrice (=DI), the latter motivated in large part by\nthe publication in 1610 of Galileo\u2019s Sidereal Messenger\n(Sidereus Nuncius). In his Conversation with the Sidereal\nMessenger (Dissertatio cum Nuncio Sidereo \u2026 a\nGalillaeo Galilaeo, KGW 4, pp. 281\u2013311), he supported the\nfactual information given by Galileo, indicating at the same time the\nnecessity of giving an account of the causes of the observed\nphenomena. The background for his investigation into optics was\nundoubtedly the different particular questions of astronomical optics\n(see Straker 1971). In this context he concentrated his efforts on an\nexplanation of the phenomena of eclipses, of the apparent size of the\nMoon and of atmospheric refraction. Kepler investigated the theory of\nthe camera obscura very early and recorded its general\nprinciples (see commentary by M. Hammer in KGW 2, pp. 400\u20131 and\nStraker 1981). In addition, he worked intensively on the theory of the\ntelescope and invented the refracting astronomical or\n\u2018Keplerian\u2019 telescope, which involved a considerable\nimprovement over the Galilean telescope (see especially DI, Problem\n86, KGW 4, pp. 387\u201388). Besides these impressive contributions,\nKepler expanded his research program to embrace mathematics as well as\nanatomy, discussing for instance conic sections and explaining the\nprocess of vision (see Crombie 1991 and especially Lindberg\n1976b).\n\nIn Chapter 1 of APO (\u201cOn the Nature of Light\u201d), Kepler\nexpounds 38 propositions concerning different properties of light:\nlight flows in all directions from every point of a body\u2019s\nsurface; it has no matter, weight, or resistance. Following\u2014but\nalso inverting\u2014the Aristotelian argument for the temporality of\nmotion, he affirms that the motion of light takes place not in time\nbut in an instant (in momento). Light is propagated by\nstraight lines (rays), which are not light itself but its motion. It\nis important to note that although light travels from one body to\nanother, it is not a body but a two-dimensional entity which tends to\nexpand to a curved surface. The two-dimensionality of light is\nprobably the main reason why it is incorporeal. Motion in general\nplays a significant role in Kepler\u2019s philosophy of light. For\nStraker, the supposed link between optics and physics (especially in\nProp. 20, where the mechanical analyses are introduced) \u201creveals\nthe full extent of his commitment to a mechanical physics of\nlight\u201d (Straker 1971, p. 509).\n\nTwo questions are intensively discussed by modern specialists.\nFirstly, to what extent is the attribution of a mechanistic approach\nto Kepler justified? Secondly, how should one determine his place in\nthe history of sciences, especially in the field of optics: do the\nmain lines of thought in Kepler\u2019s optics indicate a\ncontinuity or rather a rupture with tradition? There\nare well\u2013grounded arguments for different positions on both\nquestions. For Crombie (1967, 1991) and Straker, Kepler develops a\nmechanical approach, which can be particularly appreciated in his\nexplanation of vision using the model of the camera obscura.\nBesides this, Straker stresses that Kepler\u2019s basic mechanicism\nis also powerfully assisted by his conception of light as a\nnon-active, passive entity. In addition, the concept of motion and the\nexplanations using the model of the balance are indicative of a\ncommitment to mechanicism (Straker 1970, pp. 502\u20133). On the\ncontrary, Lindberg (1976a), who supports the \u201ccontinuity\nside\u201d of the dispute, has quite convincingly showed that, for\nKepler, light has a constructive and active function in the universe,\nnot only in optics but also in astrology, astronomy, and natural\nphilosophy (for Kepler\u2019s criticism of the medieval tradition see\nalso Chen-Morris / Unguru, 2001).\n7. Harmony and Soul\n\nFrom a philosophical point of view, Kepler considered the HM to be his\nmain work and the one he most cherished. Containing his third\nplanetary law, this work represents definitively a seminal\ncontribution to the history of astronomy. But he did not reduce his\nlong prepared project to an astronomical investigation\u2014his first\nthoughts on the notion of \u201charmony\u201d arose already in 1599,\nalthough he did not publish his work until 1619\u2014but instead\nextensively discussed its mathematical foundations and its\nphilosophical implications, including astrology, natural philosophy\nand psychology. Thus, Kepler\u2019s third planetary law appears in a\ncontext which goes far beyond astronomy and to a great extent takes up\nagain the perspective of his youthful MC. When talking about\n\u201charmony\u201d in Kepler, one needs to keep in mind that the\nbackground giving its full significance to this notion goes far beyond\nmusic theory. Of course, music is involved and plays a determining\nrole \u2013 and along with it the corresponding mathematical concepts\nstemming from the Pythagorean tradition. However, in Kepler\n\u201charmony\u201d represents the most general idea, the very core\nof the world as an ordered whole and, therefore, the ultimate goal to\nbe pursued in his philosophical investigations. Social and political\naspects are also included. It is surely not a minor detail that\nKepler, on the threshold of the Thirty Years\u2019 War, dedicated his\nHM to King James I of England \u201cthe man whom Kepler believed was\nbest suited to apply its lessons to the most pressing harmony of all:\nthe harmony of church and state\u201d (Rothman 2017, p. 6).\n\nAccording to Kepler, it is necessary to distinguish\n\u201csensible\u201d from \u201cpure\u201d harmony. The first is\nto be found among natural, sensible entities, like sounds in music or\nrays of light; both could be in proportion to one another and hence in\nharmony. He resolves this matter by combining three of the\nAristotelian categories: quantity, relation and, finally, quality.\nThrough the function of the category of relation Kepler passes over to\nthe active function of the mind (or soul). It turns out that two\nthings can be characterized as harmonic if they can be compared\naccording to the category of quantity. But the fact that at least two\nthings are needed shows that the property of \u201cbeing\nharmonic\u201d is not a property of an isolated thing. Furthermore,\nthe relationship between the things cannot be found in the things\nthemselves either; rather, it is produced by the mind: \u201cin\ngeneral every relation is nothing without mind apart from the things\nwhich it relates, because they do not have the relation which they are\nsaid to have unless the presence of some mind is assumed, to relate\none to another\u201d (KGW 6, p. 212; Engl. trans., p. 291). This\nprocess takes place through the comparison of different sensible\nthings with an archetype (archetypus) present in the\nmind.\n\nThe next central question directly concerns gnoseology, for Kepler\ngives a psychological account of the path followed by sensible things\ninto the mind. He resumes the scholastic species theory: immaterial\nspecies radiate from the sensible things and affect the sense organs\nby acting firstly on the \u201cforecourts\u201d and then on the\ninternal functions (for the notion of \u2018species\u2019 in Kepler\nsee Rabin 2005, which has found both favorable and critical reception\nin the literature). They arrive at the imagination and from there go\nover to the sensus communis, so that, according to the\ntraditional teaching, the sensible information received is now able to\nbe processed and used in statements. From here onwards, the sensible\nthings are \u201cpreserved in the memory, brought forth by\nrecollection, [and] distinguished by the higher faculty of the\nsoul\u201d (Caspar 1993, p. 269, cf. KGW 6, p. 214, lines\n18\u201323; Engl. trans., p. 293). While harmony arises as an\nactivity of the soul/mind consisting in relating quantitatively,\nKepler adds, taking over the Aristotelian doctrine of categories, that\nharmony is a \u201cqualitative relation\u201d as well, involving the\n\u201cquality of shape, being formed from the regular figures\u201d,\nwhich provides the grounds for comparison (KGW 6, p. 216, lines\n37\u201341; Engl. trans., p. 296). If this is how\n\u201cthings\u201d, i.e., sensible entities, find their way into the\nsoul in order to be compared, it by no means represents\u2014as\nKepler admitted\u2014a sufficient explanation of how non-sensible\nthings, i.e., mathematical entities, find their way into the mind. How\ndo they come into the soul? Kepler accepted Aristotle\u2019s\ncriticism of Pythagorean philosophy concerning numbers: both Kepler\nand Aristotle are convinced that numbers constitute ontologically a\nlower class within mathematical entities (for Kepler, they are derived\nfrom geometrical entities). Nevertheless, Aristotle\u2019s philosophy\nis insufficient to grasp the essence of mathematics. By aligning\nhimself with Proclus, from whom he quotes a long passage of his\nCommentary on Euclides, Kepler defends Plato\u2019s theory\nof anamn\u00easis against Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of the\ntabula rasa. His discussion lies at the origin of the\nclassical debate between empiricism and rationalism which was to\ndominate the philosophical scene for generations to come. A connection\nwith idealism is, of course, apparent (see, for instance, Caspar 1993,\nEngl. trans., p. 269), and it is a fact that Kepler was positively\nreceived within German Idealism of the 19th century\n(Schwaetzer 2016, esp. 217\u201319). Historically, however, it seems\nto be more accurate to link his position with the philosophical\ntradition of St. Augustine.\n\nBesides psychology and gnoseology, the other main spectrum of\nquestions Kepler deals with in Book 4 is his theory of\n\u201caspects\u201d, i.e., astrology (HM, IV, Cap. 4\u20137), a\nfurther field of application of his psychology and further evidence of\nthe role of geometry in his philosophy. The \u201caspects\u201d,\ni.e., the angles between the planets, Moon and Sun, are all he wishes\nto save from the old astrology, which he harshly criticizes; for the\naspects are or can be reduced to geometrical structures, the\narchetypes, which can be recognized by the soul. According to Kepler,\nthere is no \u201cmechanical influence\u201d of the heavens (stars\nand constellations are not relevant in his astrology) which exerts a\ndetermining effect on the Earth and on human life. Rather, both the\nEarth and human beings, ultimately, like all other living entities,\nare provided with a soul in which the geometrical archetypes are\npresent. By the formation of an aspect in the heavens, symmetry arises\nand stimulates the soul of the Earth or of human beings. \u201cThe\nEarth,\u201d Kepler writes, responds to \u201cwhat the aspects\nwhistle\u201d (KGW 11.2, p. 48; for his astrology see especially\nField 1984 and Rabin 1997, Boner 2005 and 2006).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriSou\">A.
