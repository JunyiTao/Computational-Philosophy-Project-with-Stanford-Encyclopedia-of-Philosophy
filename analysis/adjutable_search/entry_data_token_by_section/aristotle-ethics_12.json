    "main_text": "Friendship\n10. Three Lives Compared\n\nIn Book I Aristotle says that three kinds of lives are thought to be\nespecially attractive: one is devoted to pleasure, a second to\npolitics, and a third to knowledge and understanding\n(1095b17\u201319). In X.6\u20139 he returns to these three\nalternatives, and explores them more fully than he had in Book I. The\nlife of pleasure is construed in Book I as a life devoted to physical\npleasure, and is quickly dismissed because of its vulgarity. In X.6,\nAristotle concedes that physical pleasures, and more generally,\namusements of all sorts, are desirable in themselves, and therefore\nhave some claim to be our ultimate end. But his discussion of\nhappiness in Book X does not start from scratch; he builds on his\nthesis that pleasure cannot be our ultimate target, because what\ncounts as pleasant must be judged by some standard other than pleasure\nitself, namely the judgment of the virtuous person. Amusements will\nnot be absent from a happy life, since everyone needs relaxation, and\namusements fill this need. But they play a subordinate role, because\nwe seek relaxation in order to return to more important\nactivities.\n\nAristotle turns therefore, in X.7\u20138, to the two remaining\nalternatives\u2014politics and philosophy\u2014and presents a series\nof arguments to show that the philosophical life, a life devoted to\ntheoria (contemplation, study), is best. Theoria is\nnot the process of learning that leads to understanding; that process\nis not a candidate for our ultimate end, because it is undertaken for\nthe sake of a further goal. What Aristotle has in mind when he talks\nabout theoria is the activity of someone who has already\nachieved theoretical wisdom. The happiest life is lived by someone who\nhas a full understanding of the basic causal principles that govern\nthe operation of the universe, and who has the resources needed for\nliving a life devoted to the exercise of that understanding. Evidently\nAristotle believes that his own life and that of his philosophical\nfriends was the best available to a human being. He compares it to the\nlife of a god: god thinks without interruption and endlessly, and a\nphilosopher enjoys something similar for a limited period of time.\n\nIt may seem odd that after devoting so much attention to the practical\nvirtues, Aristotle should conclude his treatise with the thesis that\nthe best activity of the best life is not ethical. In fact, some\nscholars have held that X.7\u20138 are deeply at odds with the rest\nof the Ethics; they take Aristotle to be saying that we\nshould be prepared to act unethically, if need be, in order to devote\nourselves as much as possible to contemplation. But it is difficult to\nbelieve that he intends to reverse himself so abruptly, and there are\nmany indications that he intends the arguments of X.7\u20138 to be\ncontinuous with the themes he emphasizes throughout the rest of the\nEthics. The best way to understand him is to take him to be\nassuming that one will need the ethical virtues in order to live the\nlife of a philosopher, even though exercising those virtues is not the\nphilosopher\u2019s ultimate end. To be adequately equipped to live a\nlife of thought and discussion, one will need practical wisdom,\ntemperance, justice, and the other ethical virtues. To say that there\nis something better even than ethical activity, and that ethical\nactivity promotes this higher goal, is entirely compatible with\neverything else that we find in the Ethics.\n\nAlthough Aristotle\u2019s principal goal in X.7\u20138 is to show\nthe superiority of philosophy to politics, he does not deny that a\npolitical life is happy. Perfect happiness, he says, consists in\ncontemplation; but he indicates that the life devoted to practical\nthought and ethical virtue is happy in a secondary way. He thinks of\nthis second-best life as that of a political leader, because he\nassumes that the person who most fully exercises such qualities as\njustice and greatness of soul is the man who has the large resources\nneeded to promote the common good of the city. The political life has\na major defect, despite the fact that it consists in fully exercising\nthe ethical virtues, because it is a life devoid of philosophical\nunderstanding and activity. Were someone to combine both careers,\npracticing politics at certain times and engaged in philosophical\ndiscussion at other times (as Plato\u2019s philosopher-kings do), he\nwould lead a life better than that of Aristotle\u2019s politician,\nbut worse than that of Aristotle\u2019s philosopher.\n\nBut his complaint about the political life is not simply that it is\ndevoid of philosophical activity. The points he makes against it\nreveal drawbacks inherent in ethical and political activity. Perhaps\nthe most telling of these defects is that the life of the political\nleader is in a certain sense unleisurely (1177b4\u201315). What\nAristotle has in mind when he makes this complaint is that ethical\nactivities are remedial: they are needed when something has gone\nwrong, or threatens to do so. Courage, for example, is exercised in\nwar, and war remedies an evil; it is not something we should wish for.\nAristotle implies that all other political activities have the same\nfeature, although perhaps to a smaller degree. Corrective justice\nwould provide him with further evidence for his thesis\u2014but what\nof justice in the distribution of goods? Perhaps Aristotle would reply\nthat in existing political communities a virtuous person must\naccommodate himself to the least bad method of distribution, because,\nhuman nature being what it is, a certain amount of injustice must be\ntolerated. As the courageous person cannot be completely satisfied\nwith his courageous action, no matter how much self-mastery it shows,\nbecause he is a peace-lover and not a killer, so the just person\nliving in the real world must experience some degree of\ndissatisfaction with his attempts to give each person his due. The\npleasures of exercising the ethical virtues are, in normal\ncircumstances, mixed with pain. Unalloyed pleasure is available to us\nonly when we remove ourselves from the all-too-human world and\ncontemplate the rational order of the cosmos. No human life can\nconsist solely in these pure pleasures; and in certain circumstances\none may owe it to one\u2019s community to forego a philosophical life\nand devote oneself to the good of the city. But the paradigms of human\nhappiness are those people who are lucky enough to devote much of\ntheir time to the study of a world more orderly than the human world\nwe inhabit.\n\nAlthough Aristotle argues for the superiority of the philosophical\nlife in X.7\u20138, he says in X.9, the final chapter of the\nEthics, that his project is not yet complete, because we can\nmake human beings virtuous, or good even to some small degree, only if\nwe undertake a study of the art of legislation. The final section of\nthe Ethics is therefore intended as a prolegomenon to\nAristotle\u2019s political writings. We must investigate the kinds of\npolitical systems exhibited by existing Greek cities, the forces that\ndestroy or preserve cities, and the best sort of political order.\nAlthough the study of virtue Aristotle has just completed is meant to\nbe helpful to all human beings who have been brought up\nwell\u2014even those who have no intention of pursuing a political\ncareer\u2014it is also designed to serve a larger purpose. Human\nbeings cannot achieve happiness, or even something that approximates\nhappiness, unless they live in communities that foster good habits and\nprovide the basic equipment of a well-lived life.\n\nThe study of the human good has therefore led to two conclusions: The\nbest life is not to be found in the practice of politics. But the well\nbeing of whole communities depends on the willingness of some to lead\na second-best life\u2014a life devoted to the study and practice of\nthe art of politics, and to the expression of those qualities of\nthought and passion that exhibit our rational self-mastery.\nGlossary\n\nappearances: phainomena\nbeautiful: kalon\nclear: saphes\ncomplete (verb, also: to perfect): telein\ncondition: hexis\ncontinence (literally: mastery): enkrateia\ncontinent: enkrat\u00eas\ndisposition: hexis\nemotion: pathos\nevil: kakos, phaulos\nexcellence: aret\u00ea\nfeeling: pathos\nfine: kalon\nflourishing: eudaimonia\nfriendship: philia; philein (the verb cognate to\nthe noun \u201cphilia\u201d, can sometimes be translated\n\u201clike\u201d or even \u201clove\u201d)\nfunction: ergon\ngood will: eunoia\nhappiness: eudaimonia\nhappy: eudaimon\nimpetuosity: propeteia\nincontinence (literally: lack of mastery): akrasia\nincontinent: akrat\u00eas\nintuitive understanding: nous\nlive well: eu z\u00ean\npractical wisdom: phron\u00easis\nscience: epist\u00eam\u00ea\nstandard: horos\nstate: hexis\ntask: ergon\nvirtue: aret\u00ea\nweakness: astheneia\nwork: ergon\n\n",
