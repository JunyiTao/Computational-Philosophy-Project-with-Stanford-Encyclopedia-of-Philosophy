    "main_text": "Averroes (Ibn Rushd) and Some of His Followers\n9. Averroes (Ibn Rushd) and Some of His Followers\n\nAverroes (Ibn Rushd, 1126\u20131198) is usually regarded to have been\nthe major \u201cmaster\u201d of Islamic philosophy among Jews in the\nLate Middle Ages \u2013 although he might have had to share this key\nposition with Avicenna and al-Ghazali. Almost all his philosophical\nworks were translated from Arabic into Hebrew in the period\n1230\u20131330, sometimes even more than once (only one of them was\nlater translated from Latin into Hebrew, around 1480); almost all of\nthem were quoted, summarized, paraphrased, annotated and commented on\nby a number of philosophers during the 14th and\n15th centuries. As a matter of fact, some of these texts\nare preserved only through these translations, due to the loss of\ntheir original versions, and their success among Jewish philosophers\nwas surely wider than the success they gained among Arabic thinkers,\nand probably equal to the success they gained among Latin Christian\nones. A real history of \u201cJewish Averroism\u201d has not yet\nbeen written, so that most information about it can be found in\nSteinschneider\u2019s book about Medieval Jewish translations\n(Steinschneider 1893, 49\u2013339).\n\nMaimonides set the tone of this Jewish approach to Averroes by\naffirming in his letter to Samuel Ibn Tibbon: \u201cTake care not to\nread Aristotle\u2019s books without the commentaries on them: those\nby Alexander (of Aphrodisias), those by Themistius, and those by\nAverroes\u201d (Marx 1934\u20131935, 378). There are some clues to\nthe fact that Maimonides and Averroes agreed in some key points of\ntheir doctrines, especially in the fields of metaphysics and theology;\nhowever, Maimonides explicitely declared in a letter to his disciple\nJoseph ben Judah, written when he had just completed some parts of the\nGuide, that he had received a copy of most of Averroes\u2019\ncommentaries on Aristotle, but had not yet read them (about the\nrelationship between Maimonides and Averroes, see Pines\u2019\nobservations in Moses Maimonides 1963, 1:cviii-cxxi). As a matter of\nfact, a concrete, sure proof of Averroes\u2019 influence on\nMaimonides\u2019 philosophical thought has not yet been found; but\nthis does not exclude that he really knew well Averroes\u2019\nphilosophy. In any case, Maimonides opened the way to a sort of\nadoption of Averroes as an unofficial, \u201cJudaizing\u201d\ninterpreter of Aristotle: the many Western European Jewish followers\nof Maimonides\u2019 thought (active in Spain, Provence, and Italy in\nthe 13th-15th centuries) seem to have referred\nto the above words as a justification for employing the commentaries\nof Averroes in reading and interpreting Aristotle\u2019s works.\nSignificantly, they did not usually employ either Alexander or\nThemistius, i.e., the other two commentators recommended by\nMaimonides. Their particular choice of Averroes might be explained\neither because of the example given by contemporary Latin Christian\ncommentators, or because of the easier availability of his\ncommentaries in Spain (where they had been written and had spread\nduring Averroes\u2019 life) with respect of those by al-Farabi,\nAvicenna and Ibn Bajja, or because of the didactic usefulness of them\nfor knowing in detail Aristotle\u2019s words and the opinions of all\nthe other Greek and Arabic commentators, whom Averroes quoted and\ndiscussed in his works. Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera, in the introduction to\nhis work The Opinions of the Philosophers (a detailed\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s physics and metaphysics), affirms:\n\u201cAll that I have written here corresponds to Aristotle\u2019s\nwords, as they are commented on by the sage Averroes. He was the last\nof the commentators (of Aristotle), and collected the cream of the\nworks of the previous commentators, as well as of Aristotle\u2019s\nwords\u201d.\n\nA key role in transmitting to Jewish philosophers a direct knowledge\nof Averroes\u2019 philosophy was obviously played by the\nArabic-into-Hebrew translations of his works, including\nAverroes\u2019 various commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s texts. This\ntranslation process involved a number of scholars: in approximate\nchronological order, they were Jacob Anatoli (who finished in Naples\nin 1232 his translation of Averroes\u2019 \u201cmiddle\ncommentaries\u201d [talkhisat] on Porphyry\u2019s\nIsagoge, as well as on Aristotle\u2019s Categories\n[both published in a critical edition in Averrois Cordubensis 1969],\nDe interpretatione, Prior and Posterior Analytics),\nMoses Ibn Tibbon (who wrote in Provence in the period 1244\u20131261\nhis translations of Averroes\u2019 summaries of Aristotle\u2019s\nPhysics, De caelo, De generatione [critical edition:\nAverrois Cordubensis 1958], Meteorology, De anima, De sensu et\nsensato [critical edition: Averrois Cordubensis 1954],\nMetaphysics, as well as that of the \u201cmiddle\ncommentary\u201d on the De anima [critical edition: Ivry\n2003]), Solomon Ibn Ayyub (who wrote in B\u00e9ziers in 1259 his\ntranslation of the \u201cmiddle commentary\u201d on the De\ncaelo), Shem Tov ben Isaac of Tortosa (who wrote around\n1255\u20131260 his translation of the \u201cmiddle commentary\u201d\non the De anima), Zerahyah Hen (who finished in Rome in 1284\nhis translation of the \u201cmiddle commentaries\u201d on the\nPhysics and the Metaphysics [critical edition: Zonta\n2011]), Jacob ben Makhir (who finished in Provence in 1289 his\ntranslation of the summaries of Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge and\nAristotle\u2019s Organon, including Rhetoric and\nPoetics, and translated in 1302 Averroes\u2019 \u201cmiddle\ncommentary\u201d on Aristotle\u2019s De partibus and De\ngeneratione animalium), Qalonymos ben Qalonymos (who translated\nin Arles in the period 1313\u20131317 the \u201cmiddle\ncommentaries\u201d on Aristotle\u2019s Topics, Sophistical\nConfutations, Physics, De generatione [critical edition: Averrois\nCordubensis 1958], Meteorology, and Metaphysics [see\nZonta 2010 and 2011], as well as the \u201clong commentaries\u201d\non the Posterior Analytics, the Physics, and\npossibly on the Metaphysics too [about the last work,\nhowever, see Halper 2010 and 2013]), Samuel of Marseilles (who\ntranslated in Beaucaire in 1320\u20131322 the \u201cmiddle\ncommentary\u201d on the Nicomachean Ethics [critical\nedition: Berman 1999], as well as that on Plato\u2019s\nRepublic [critical edition: Rosenthal 1956, 1966], and\nrevised the previous Arabic-to-Hebrew versions of Averroes\u2019\nEpitome of the Organon and Middle Commentary on\nPorphyry's Isagoge), Moses of Salon (who translated around 1320\nthe \u201clong commentary\u201d on the Metaphysics,\npossibly employing Qalonymos\u2019 previous translation), and Todros\nTodrosi (who translated in Trinquetaille in 1337 the \u201cmiddle\ncommentaries\u201d on Rhetoric and Poetics\n[critical editions: Goldenthal 1842, Lasinio 1872]). Also the first\npart of Averroes\u2019 commentary on the De intellectu\nascribed to Alexander of Aphrodisias was translated into Hebrew\n(critical edition: Davidson 1988). Other philosophical works by\nAverroes are known through the Arabic-into-Hebrew versions made in the\n14th century: they include Averroes\u2019 Questions on\nLogic (some of which were written by some Spanish Arabo-Islamic\nfollowers of him) and Questions on Physics (English\ntranslation: Goldstein 1990), the De substantia orbis (Fi\nl-jirm al-samawi) \u2014 which is lost in Arabic, but is\npreserved in an anonymous Medieval Hebrew translation published in a\ncritical edition by Arthur Hyman (Averroes 1986; about another aspect\nof the Medieval Hebrew tradition of this work, see Rigo 1992) \u2014\nthe Epistle on the Possibility of the Conjunction of the\nIntellect \u2014 which is lost in Arabic, but is preserved in an\nanonymous Hebrew translation commented on by Moses Narboni (critical\nedition by Kalman P. Bland in Ibn Rushd 1982) \u2014 and the treatise\nOn the First Mover (Fi l-muharrik al-awwal) \u2013\nwhich is lost in Arabic, and is preserved in some Medieval Hebrew\nquotations by Moses ha-Levi (see Wolfson 1950) and Shem Tov Ibn\nFalaquera. Moreover, Averroes\u2019 defence of Aristotelian (and his\nown) philosophy against al-Ghazali\u2019s attacks, The\nIncoherence of the Incoherence (Tahafut al-tahafut), was\nfirst employed as a major source for Falaquera\u2019s Guide to\nthe Guide, and then translated twice into Hebrew in Provence\nbefore 1340, by an anonymous author (Moses Narboni?) and by Qalonymos\nben David Todrosi (maybe, a Jewish Averroist) \u2013 by the former\nfor defending Aristotelianism, and by the latter for showing its\ninternal contradictions (Steinschneider 1893, 332\u2013337). Finally,\neven a very short work on the intellect by Averroes\u2019 son, Abu\nMuhammad \u2018Abdallah Ibn Rushd, was translated into Hebrew and\nmight have had some influence on Late Medieval Judaic thought (Burnett\nand Zonta 2000).\n\nAlmost all these works were quoted and commented on by a number of\n14th- and 15th-centuries Jewish philosophers (as for the important\ncase of Aristotle\u2019s Physics, see Glasner 2011). More or\nless literal passages taken from the commentaries on Aristotle are\nfound in part one of Judah ben Solomon ha-Cohen\u2019s encyclopedia,\nThe Learning of Science (Midrash ha-hokhmah),\nwritten in Judaeo-Arabic and then translated into Hebrew in the period\n1235\u20131247 (Fontaine 2000), and in Falaquera\u2019s Opinions\nof the Philosophers (Harvey 2000). However, the influence of this\ncommentaries was widespread in Provence, in the first half of the\n14th century, when a number of supercommentaries on them\nwas written down. The famous Jewish philosopher and scientist Levi ben\nGershom (Gersonides, 1288\u20131344), active in Avignon and in other\nProven\u00e7al places from 1319 onwards, wrote a series of\nsupercommentaries on Averroes\u2019 commentaries on Aristotle in the\nperiod 1320\u20131324; some of his \u201cstudents\u201d (S.\nha-Levi, Porfash, Solomon of Urgul, Vital), as well as the\nProven\u00e7al Jewish philosopher Yeda\u2018yah ha-Penini of\nB\u00e9ziers (1280\u20131340 circa), followed his example (see\nGlasner 1995). Due to his innovative and sometimes critical approach\nto the study of Averroes\u2019 Aristotelianism, Gersonides was surely\nthe most original 14th-century Jewish interpreter of\nAverroes\u2019 philosophy; but he was not the only major one. A more\nfaithful approach to Averroes is found in Moses Narboni, who wrote a\nnumber of still unpublished commentaries on his works (not only\nsupercommentaries on his Aristotelian commentaries, but also\ncommentaries on some other philosophical texts by Averroes), and\nregarded him as the ideal interpreter of Aristotelianism. He affirmed\nthat there was no need to verify Aristotle\u2019s teaching, since it\nwas surely true, as confirmed by Averroes\u2019 assertion that\nAristotle had the first and the last word on everything.\n\nJewish Averroism, in the sense of a substantial agreement with\nAverroes\u2019 interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s works, continued\nin 15th-century Spain and Italy. For example, it was found\nin the philosophical supercommentaries on Averroes\u2019\n\u201cmiddle commentaries\u201d on the Posterior Analytics\nand the Metaphysics written around 1450 by the Aragonese Jew\nAbraham Bibago, as well as in the works of a member of a family of\nSpanish Jewish philosophers, the Ibn Shem Tovs: Isaac ben Josef Ibn\nShem Tov, active in the period 1470\u20131490, wrote a series of\nsupercommentaries on Averroes\u2019 commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s\nPhysics (Wolfson 1929b). Evident traces of it can be found\nalso in Elijah Delmedigo (1460\u20131493), who praised Averroes as\nthe best philosopher after Aristotle and Alexander of Aphrodisias.\nHowever, in some cases it seems that this form of Averroism was\ncuriously influenced by some Latin Scholastic trends, like Thomism and\nLatin Averroism. This might have happened in the anonymous Hebrew\nsupercommentary on Averroes\u2019 \u201cmiddle commentary\u201d on\nthe Nicomachean Ethics, probably written in Spain around\n1440, as well as in the works written by a 15th-century\nItalian author: Judah Messer Leon (1425\u20131498 circa), whose bulk\ncommentary on books one, two and three of Aristotle\u2019s\nPhysics was explicitly based upon Averroes\u2019\n\u201cmiddle\u201d and \u201clong commentaries\u201d on Aristotle,\nbut employed a lot of direct or indirect Scholastic sources (see Zonta\n2006b, 214\u2013217). In other cases, some 15th-century\nSpanish Jewish philosophers even openly attacked Averroism as an\nold-fashioned trend: Eli Habillo did this around 1470, in introducing\nhis own translation of Antonius Andreas\u2019 questions on\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that even some of Averroes\u2019\n\u201creligious\u201d works were translated into Hebrew and employed\nas sources by some Jewish philosophers: the Decisive Treatise\n(Fasl al-maqal) (a critical edition of the Hebrew translation\nappeared in Golb 1956\u20131957), the Appendix\n(Damima) to it (see Vajda 1954), and the Disclosure of\nthe Proof Methods Concerning the Principles of Religion\n(Kashf fi manahig al-adilla fi \u2018aqa\u2019id al-milla)\n(see Di Donato 2006). All these works inspired some parts of\nFalaquera\u2019s commentary on Maimonides\u2019 Guide, as\nwell as his defence of philosophy in the Epistle of Debate for\nExplaining the Concordance between Religious Law and Science\n(Iggeret ha-wikkuah be-ve\u2019ur ha-haskamah asher beyn ha-Torah\nwe-ha-hokhmah; critical edition: Harvey 1987); however, apart\nfrom this case, they seems to have had no extensive influence on Late\nMedieval Jewish philosophy.\n",
