    "main_text": "\n\nIn Derek Parfit\u2019s original formulation the Repugnant Conclusion\nis stated as follows: \u201cFor any possible population of at least\nten billion people, all with a very high quality of life, there must\nbe some much larger imaginable population whose existence, if other\nthings are equal, would be better even though its members have lives\nthat are barely worth living\u201d (Parfit 1984). The Repugnant\nConclusion highlights a problem in an area of ethics which has become\nknown as population ethics. The last three decades have\nwitnessed an increasing philosophical interest in questions such as\n\u201cIs it possible to make the world a better place by creating\nadditional happy people?\u201d and \u201cIs there a moral obligation\nto have children?\u201d The main problem has been to find an adequate\ntheory about the moral value of states of affairs where the number of\npeople, the quality of their lives (or their life-time welfare or\nwell-being\u2014we shall use these terms interchangeably here), and\ntheir identities may vary. Since, arguably, any reasonable moral\ntheory has to take these aspects of possible states of affairs into\naccount when determining the normative status of actions, the study of\npopulation ethics is of general import for moral theory. As the name\nindicates, Parfit finds the Repugnant Conclusion unacceptable and many\nphilosophers agree. However, it has been surprisingly difficult to\nfind a theory that avoids the Repugnant Conclusion without implying\nother equally counterintuitive conclusions. Thus, the question as to\nhow the Repugnant Conclusion should be dealt with and, more generally,\nwhat it shows about the nature of ethics has turned the conclusion\ninto one of the cardinal challenges of modern ethics.\n",
