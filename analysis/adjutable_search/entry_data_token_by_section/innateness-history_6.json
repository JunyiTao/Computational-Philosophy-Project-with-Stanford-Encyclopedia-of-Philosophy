    "main_text": "The (Temporary) Triumph of Anti-Nativism\n7. Conclusion: Choosing Sides\n\n\nAlthough the battleground for the historical controversy over\ninnateness was epistemology, if we take one step back we see the\nRationalist defense of the doctrine as part of a broader set of\nmetaphysical, theological, and ethical commitments. Different\nNativists would highlight different elements, but the underlying\npicture of human nature that emerges from the Nativist side of the\nhistorical debate is something like this. We human beings,\ndistinct from all other created things, are not fully of this material\nworld. We are guided in our thought and action by a special gift\nfrom our creator, who has seen fit to implant in our souls the deeper\ntruth of the nature of the world, and special guidance about how we are\nto act in it. We must discover this inner truth, and adhere to it\nin the face of the often-distracting course of our experience.\n\n\nLooking at Locke as the voice for the other side of the controversy,\nwe find a very different set of motivations. Nativism makes\nunderstanding seem too much like inherited wealth. It suggests\nthat without our innate legacy we would not have the resources to\nunderstand the world we live in. To this extent, Nativism stands\nagainst the ethos of individual initiative. It can also be too\neasily abused as a tool of intellectual authoritarianism, because those\nwho are not up to the task of uncovering these rarified innate truths\nmust take their lead from those who are. For the Empiricist this\nis an invitation to superstition, obscurity, and abuse. The\nEmpiricist does not see our understanding as in any way given to us as\na gift. It is the product of our individual labor. God has\ngiven all of us the general ability to reason, and this includes the\nability to acquire knowledge from experience; it is our job to exercise\nthat ability. We fully own our knowledge: we collect the raw\nmaterials and add our mental labor to create it. Locke is more\ndrawn to the dignity of the worker than to the status of the aristocrat\nwho has received a special inherited honor.\n\n\nThe factors that drove Locke\u2019s rejection of Nativism\nultimately led, in no small part through Hume\u2019s philosophy, to\nthe now-dominant naturalistic picture of human beings. On this\npicture we humans are material beings continuous with the rest of the\nnatural world, we have no divine element in our nature and no divine\nguidance to help us along, and no recourse but to build our\nunderstanding of our world on our experience. But I close with\ntwo points about these developments. The first has to do with\nLocke, our arch anti-Nativist, and it is that he would have been\nhorrified at what his Empiricism has wrought. The underlying\nRationalist picture I sketched two paragraphs back is a picture that\nLocke would, with some small reservations, have accepted. He was\na dualist and a theist, he believed in an afterlife, and he saw our\ngod-given faculty of Reason as capable of discovering the most\nimportant truths about our world and our lives \u2013 i.e., the\nexistence of God and the nature of our moral duties. The second\npoint is that even though our contemporary naturalism was inspired by\nanti-Nativist Empiricism, it has seen a revival of Nativist\nthinking. The turning point in this revival, Chomsky\u2019s work\nin linguistics, is an area set apart from the concerns that energized\nthe historical controversy over\n innateness.[17]\nBut contemporary\nresearch in cognitive development, genetics, evolutionary psychology,\nand other fields has extended Chomsky\u2019s Nativist thinking to the\nvery concepts and principles that were at the heart of the historical\ndebate (god, morality, personhood/mind, causality, mathematics, basic\nontology, etc.).\n",
