Highlights of Historical Western Thought This section outlines the main currents of historical\nphilosophical thought about suicide in \u2018the West\u2019 (Europe,\nthe Middle East, and North America). Such an emphasis should not\nobscure the rich traditions of thought originating outside those\ngeographical confines, however. Important thinkers from Africa, Asia,\nand the indigenous populations of the Western hemisphere took a\nphilosophical interest in suicide. Little appears to unite\nphilosophical thinking about suicide from these traditions aside from\nthe fact that they are far less influenced by monotheism than is the\nWestern tradition. Some of the ethical considerations concerning\nsuicide raised in these traditions are also found in Western thought.\nFor instance, the claim that suicide may violate ethical duties to\nothers is addressed by Confucius, who primarily views the matter\nthrough the lens of filial piety (Confucius 2003). Others, for example\nthe Jain practice of sallekhana, a type of spiritual fasting\nintended to hasten death, do not seem to have correlates in the\nWestern tradition (Umaswati 1992). Unfortunately, the diversity of\npositions within the non-Western traditions preclude easy summation.\nThose interested in these traditions are urged to consult Battin\n(2015). (The\n online archive\n of Battin (2015) is particularly useful in this regard; users can\nsearch for philosophical writings on suicide based on geographic\norigin and intellectual tradition.)\n\n",
