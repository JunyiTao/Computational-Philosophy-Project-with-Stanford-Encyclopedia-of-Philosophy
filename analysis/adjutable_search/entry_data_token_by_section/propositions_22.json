    "main_text": "Propositions, Facts, and States of Affairs\n9. Propositions, Facts, and States of Affairs\n\nFrege famously wrote, \u201c\u2018Facts, facts, facts\u2019 cries\nthe scientist if he wants to bring home the necessity of a firm\nfoundation for science. What is a fact? A fact is a thought that is\ntrue.\u201d (1918, p. 25)\n\nIs a fact just a true proposition? There are metaphysical and\nlinguistic arguments to the contrary. Here is a standard metaphysical\nargument. The fact that snow is white couldn\u2019t exist if snow\nwasn\u2019t white, but the true proposition would (only it would be\nfalse). Therefore, the fact isn\u2019t the true proposition (See\nMoore 1953, p. 308). Facts might be, still, in some sense,\nderivative from true propositions, even if the identity claim fails.\nFollowing Moore (1953, pp. 261\u20132) and Slote (1974, p. 99), Kit\nFine (1982, pp. 52\u20133) suggests that facts may be conceived as\nconcretizations of true propositions. Thus, the fact that \\(p\\) is the\ntruth of \\(\\ltb p\\gtb\\). However, so construing facts makes them poor\ncandidates for truthmakers: the truth of \\(p\\), presumably, is not\nwhat makes \\(\\ltb p\\gtb\\) true.\n\nOne well-known linguistic argument against identifying facts with true\npropositions is closely related to the Ambiguity Response to The\nSubstitution Problem, considered in Section 5.4. Substitution of\n\u2018the fact that \\(p\\)\u2019 for \u2018the true proposition that\n\\(p\\)\u2019, or vice versa, produces peculiarities such as\n\u201cJohn believes the fact that Obama is president\u201d, or\nHarman\u2019s (2003) \u201cThe true proposition that fires are hot\nmakes it the case that fires are hot.\u201d If facts were true\npropositions, so it is argued, one would expect the substitutions to\npreserve truth.\n\nNonetheless, there are other uses of \u2018fact\u2019 that support\nthe identification:\n\nSnow is white. That\u2019s a fact. But it wouldn\u2019t have been a\nfact if snow were not white. So, some things that are facts might not\nhave been facts.\n\n\nUsed in this way, \u2018fact\u2019 seems to apply to entities that\nresemble propositions, in that they have two modes of being: existence\nand something akin to truth (e.g., obtaining) (see McGrath\n 2003).[12]\n\nOne option, in the face of apparently conflicting uses of\n\u2018fact\u2019, is to posit an ambiguity. (Fine 1982, p. 54) There\nare two kinds of entity associated with different uses of\n\u2018fact\u2019: one kind has one mode of being (it simply exists),\nthe other has having two modes of being (it may exist without\nobtaining). \u201cBipolar\u201d facts correspond, roughly, to what\nsome philosophers call possible states of affairs.\n\nHowever, some philosophers would want to distinguish even such bipolar\nfacts from propositions. Bipolar facts, the argument goes, are states\nof affairs, rather than true propositions. Clearly, not all\npropositions can be possible states of affairs, because there are\npropositions that are not possibly true, whereas possible states of\naffairs must obtain in at least some possible world. We might wish to\nextend the notion of a state of affairs to include impossible ones.\nWhether states of affairs, understood in this extended sense, are\npropositions clearly depends on the answers to questions about their\nidentity conditions. See the entry on\n states of affairs,\n as well as Richard (2013) for a recent view identifying propositions\nwith states of affairs.\n\nKing (1995, 2007, 2014) argues that all propositions are facts,\nalthough not the ones that we might expect. The proposition that Mary\nloves John is not the fact that Mary loves John but rather (to a first\napproximation) the following fact: Mary, loving, and John being the\nsemantic values of linguistic items standing in a certain syntactic\nrelation (represented by a phrase marker tree) which encodes\ninstantiation. King argues that his account has many virtues. It helps\nsolve the problem of the unity of the proposition (see the previous\nsection), insofar as the structure of a proposition derives from the\nsyntactic structure of a corresponding sentence. It requires\nrelatively minimal ontological commitments: if one accepts that there\nare languages with expressions designating objects and properties and\nin which certain syntactic relations encode instantiation, then one\nwill accept King-propositions. The account also provides for finely\nindividuated propositions: differences in syntactic structure of\nsentences will carry over to differences in the propositions\nexpressed. Given that the existence of King-propositions seems to\ndepend on their being language-users who use language in certain ways,\nKing is a conceptualist about propositions. (See section 7.2\nabove).\n",
