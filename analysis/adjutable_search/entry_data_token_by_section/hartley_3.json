    "main_text": "Perception and Action: The Role of \u201cJoint Impression\u201d\n4. Perception and Action: The Role of \u201cJoint Impression\u201d\n\nHartley\u2019s starting point is the living organism, and\nspecifically the physical \u201cvibrations\u201d present in brain\nand nervous system and in the universe with which the organism\ninteracts. From this starting point, two important considerations\nfollow. The first is that sensations and ideas are products, not\ngivens, and their \u201cgeneration\u201d and \u201craising\u201d\nrequire explanation. The second involves the recognition that\norganisms are active beings. Like other animals, humans move about in,\nexplore, and interact with their environments. What is more, humans\nbecome adept at performing various kinds of learned, highly skilled\nactions\u2014e.g., playing the violin. The \u201cideas\u201d humans\nhave largely occur within, and guide, such practices.\n\nConcerning the first consideration: although \u201cassociation\u201d\nis a central concept in the Observations, it is not primarily\na name for the process by which discrete experiential entities link\nup; rather, the process of neurological association generates ideas,\nincluding our categories of perception. In proposition 11, Hartley\nstates that \u201cideas, and miniature vibrations, must first be\ngenerated \u2026 before they can be associated.\u201d He adds:\n\nBut then (which is very remarkable) this power of forming ideas, and\ntheir corresponding miniature vibrations, does equally presuppose the\npower of association. For since all sensations and vibrations are\ninfinitely divisible, in respect of time and place, they could not\nleave any traces or images of themselves, i.e. any ideas, or miniature\nvibrations, unless their infinitesimal parts did cohere together\nthrough joint impression, i.e. association. (OM 1, prop. 11)\n\n\nBy stating that \u201call sensations and vibrations are infinitely\ndivisible,\u201d Hartley is elaborating on a point made by George\nBerkeley, in his Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision ([1709]\n1948), that a being born \u201cblind\u201d to bodily feeling and\npossessing only sight would have no concept of space and would be\nunable to perceive a geometrically ordered world. To such a being,\nsensations would be \u201cinfinitely\u201d\u2014i.e.,\narbitrarily\u2014divisible. No stable, repeatable \u201cideas\u201d\ncould arise from them.\n\nHartley also agrees with Berkeley\u2019s solution to this problem: we\nperceive a coherent world thanks to the generation of\n\u201cideas\u201d (cognitive, semantic, and pragmatic responses to\nthe world) through the \u201cjoint impression\u201d of sensations\nfrom distinct sensory modalities\u2014sight, hearing, and especially\ntouch. As does Berkeley, Hartley identifies feeling or touch as\n\u201cthe fundamental source of information in respect of the\nessential properties of matter\u201d and \u201cour first and\nprinciple key to the knowledge of the external world\u201d\n(OM 1, prop. 30). Thus, Hartley writes, \u201cwe call the\ntouch the reality, light the representative.\u201d The sense of sight\n\u201cmay be considered, agreeably to Bishop Berkeley\u2019s remark,\nas a philosophical language for the ideas of feeling\u201d (see\nBerkeley [1709] 1948, sections 6.4, 6.8, and 9.4).\n\nA \u201cphilosophical language\u201d is one \u201cwithout any\ndeficiency, superfluity, or equivocation\u201d (OM 1, prop.\n83), and what makes sight a \u201cphilosophical language\u201d for\nfeeling is that the two match each other: \u201cThe same qualities\nare made by means of light to impress vibrations on our eyes, which\ncorrespond in great measure to those made on the sense of feeling, so\nas to vary with their varieties\u201d (OM 1, prop. 30).\nFeeling and vision flow in tandem, with no missing, extraneous, or\nequivocal moves. It is thus joint impression, the correlation of the\nflows of sensation through two (or more) sensory modalities, so that\nthe sensations one \u201cvary with the varieties\u201d of another,\nthat accounts for the fact that we have ideas at all.\n\nIn contrast, a person whose visual inputs are dissociated from his\nother sensory modalities, and especially his own movement and feeling,\nis unable to consistently identify any \u201cvisual ideas.\u201d\nSuch is the condition of a person suffering from a visual agnosia (see\nJames 1890, 1:48\u201350).\n\nThis first consideration thus naturally leads to the second, for both\nHartley, and Berkeley before him, are talking about the actions of an\nembodied being. A living being\u2019s capacities for sensory\ndiscrimination, feature detection, and perceptual categorization are\nall involved with the repertoires of action that being performs,\neither innately or through learning.\n\nFor many animals, the ways in which physical movements vary with the\nvarieties of visual cues is relatively fixed: cats pounce on mice\n(some of cloth), and swat at moths (or moving shadows on a sunlit\nwall). For human beings, thanks to the brain\u2019s plasticity in\nforming \u201cjoint impressions,\u201d there are many ways in which\nthe \u201cvarieties\u201d of one sensation \u201cvary with the\nvarieties\u201d of another: at the sight of notes on a staff, fingers\nmove determinately upon a piano keyboard. Expert musicians, at the\nsight of the notes, hear the tune in their mind\u2019s ear.\n\nBut how to explain what it is that the expert musician (or any expert\npractitioner) does? And how does one learn to do this?\n",
