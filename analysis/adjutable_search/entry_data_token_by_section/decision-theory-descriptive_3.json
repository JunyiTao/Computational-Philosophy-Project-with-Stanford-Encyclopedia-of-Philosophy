    "main_text": "The Standard Model: Subjective Expected Utility || The probability triangle\n1.3 The probability triangle\n\nThe probability triangle (aka \u201cMarschak-Machina\ntriangle\u201d) offers a helpful visual representation of preferences\nover the space of lotteries over \\(\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}\\), with\n\\(x_3\\succ x_2 \\succ x_1\\). Since, for any \\(P\\in \\mathcal{P}\\),\n\\(P(x_2)= 1- P(x_1)-P(x_3)\\), one can represent the situation\ntwo-dimensionally, with lotteries appearing as points in a unit\ntriangle in which the horizontal axis gives us \\(P(x_1)\\) and the\nvertical one gives us \\(P(x_3)\\). The northwestern, southwestern and\nsoutheastern corners respectively correspond to the lotteries yielding\n\\(x_3, x_2\\) and \\(x_1\\) for sure.\n\nNow, as is easily demonstrated, SEU is committed to\n\n\nStochastic Dominance For all acts \\(f\\) and \\(g\\):\nif, for any outcome \\(x\\), the probability according to \\(P_f\\) of\nobtaining an outcome that is weakly preferred to \\(x\\) is at least as\ngreat as the corresponding probability according to \\(P_g\\) (in other\nwords: \\(\\sum_{\\{y\\in\\mathcal{X}: y\\succeq x\\}} P_f(y)\\) \\(\\geq\\)\n\\(\\sum_{\\{y\\in\\mathcal{X}: y\\succeq x\\}} P_g(y)\\)), then \\(P_f\\succeq\nP_g\\).\n\n\nIndeed, the above principle follows from Independence and is in fact\nequivalent to Savage\u2019s Eventwise Monotonicity\ncondition, given the other conditions in place (Grant 1995). Therefore\nlotteries become increasingly preferred both as one moves north and as\none moves west, since, in doing either, one shifts probability from a\nless to a more preferred outcome (from \\(x_2\\) to \\(x_3\\) when moving\nnorth and from \\(x_1\\) to \\(x_2\\) when moving west). The indifference\ncurves are hence upward-sloping. Steeper slopes correspond to greater\nrisk aversion, in the following sense: northeastern movements increase\nthe spread of the distribution, i.e., the degree of risk involved,\nshifting probabilities from the middle outcome (\\(x_2\\)) to the\nextremal ones (\\(x_1\\) and \\(x_3\\)). The steeper the indifference\ncurve, the greater an increase in probability of the best outcome is\nrequired in order to compensate for this increased risk. SEU clearly\nalso requires that indifference curves be both linear and\n parallel.[2]\n To illustrate:\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nAlthough SEU continues to enjoy widespread support as a normative\nmodel of choice behaviour (though see\n Section 5\n below), it is no longer generally taken to be descriptively adequate.\nA number of substantial deviations from its predictions were noted as\nearly as the 1950s and early 1960s by the likes of Allais (1953a,b)\nand Ellsberg (1961) and further investigated in the 1970s. These\nobservations led to the development of alternative models whose own\npredictive consequences have become the focus of extensive testing in\nthe past three decades or\n so.[3]\n\n",
