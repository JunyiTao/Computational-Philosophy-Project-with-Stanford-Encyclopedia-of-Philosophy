    "main_text": "\n\nThe concept of empathy is used to refer to a wide range of\npsychological capacities that are thought of as being central for\nconstituting humans as social creatures allowing us to know what other\npeople are thinking and feeling, to emotionally engage with them, to\nshare their thoughts and feelings, and to care for their\nwell\u2013being. Ever since the eighteenth century, due particularly\nto the influence of the writings of David Hume and Adam Smith, those\ncapacities have been at the center of scholarly investigations into\nthe underlying psychological basis of our social and moral nature.\nYet, the concept of empathy is of relatively recent intellectual\nheritage. Moreover, since researchers in different disciplines have\nfocused their investigations on very specific aspects of the broad\nrange of empathy-related phenomena, one should probably not be\nsurprised by a certain amount of conceptual confusion and a\nmultiplicity of definitions associated with the empathy concept in a\nnumber of different scientific and non-scientific discourses. The\npurpose of this entry is to clarify the empathy concept by surveying\nits history in various philosophical and psychological discussions and\nby indicating why empathy was and should be regarded to be of such\ncentral importance in understanding human agency in ordinary contexts,\nin the human sciences, and for the constitution of ourselves as social\nand moral agents. More specifically, after a short historical\nintroduction articulating the philosophical context within which the\nempathy concept was coined, the second and third sections will discuss\nthe epistemic dimensions associated with our empathic capacities. They\nwill address the contention that empathy is the primary epistemic\nmeans for knowing other minds and that it should be viewed as the\nunique method distinguishing the human from the natural sciences.\nSections 4 and 5 will then focus on claims that view empathy as the\nfundamental social glue and that understand empathy as the main\npsychological mechanism enabling us to establish and maintain social\nrelations and taking an evaluative stance towards each other. \n",
