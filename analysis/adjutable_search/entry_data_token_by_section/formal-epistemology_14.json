    "main_text": "Fourth Case Study: The Limits of Knowledge || The Knowability Paradox (a.k.a. the Church-Fitch Paradox)\n4.2 The Knowability Paradox (a.k.a. the Church-Fitch Paradox)\n\nCan everything that is true be known? Or are there some truths that\ncould never be known, even in principle? A famous argument popularized\nby Fitch (1963) and originally due to Alonzo Church (Salerno 2009)\nsuggests not: some truths are unknowable. For if all truths were\nknowable in principle, we could derive that all truths are actually\nknown already, which would be absurd.\n\nThe argument requires a slight extension of our epistemic logic, to\naccommodate the notion of knowability. For us, \\(K\\) means known (or\nentailed by the known), whereas knowability adds an extra modal layer:\nwhat it\u2019s possible to know. So we\u2019ll need a\nsentential operator \\(\\Diamond\\) in our language to represent\nmetaphysical possibility. Thus \\(\\Diamond \\phi\\) means\n\u201cit\u2019s metaphysically possible for \\(\\phi\\) to be\ntrue\u201d. In fact, \\(\\Diamond \\phi\\) is just short for \\(\\neg \\Box\n\\neg \\phi\\), since what doesn\u2019t have to be false can be true. So\nwe can actually add the \\(\\Box\\) instead and assume that, like the\n\\(K\\) operator, it obeys the NEC rule. (As with the\nNEC rule for the \\(K\\) operator, it\u2019s okay that\nwe can always derive \\(\\Box \\phi\\) from \\(\\phi\\), because we can only\nderive \\(\\phi\\) in the first place when \\(\\phi\\) is a logical truth.)\n\\(\\Diamond\\) is then just \\(\\neg \\Box \\neg\\) by definition.\n\nWith this addition to our language in place, we can derive the\nfollowing lemma (see the\n technical supplement\n for the derivation):\n\nLemma (Unknowns are Unknowable). \\( \\neg \\Diamond\nK(\\phi \\wedge \\neg K \\phi)\\)\n\nThis lemma basically says you can\u2019t know a fact of the sort,\n\u201c\\(\\phi\\) is true but I don\u2019t know it\u2019s true\u201d,\nwhich seems pretty sensible. If you knew such a conjunction, the\nsecond conjunct would have to be true, which conflicts with your\nknowing the first conjunct. (This is where\n\\(\\bwedge\\)-distribution proves useful.)\n\nYet this plausible looking lemma leads almost immediately to the\nunknowability of some truths. Suppose for reductio that\neverything true could be known, at least in principle. That is,\nsuppose we took as an axiom:\n\nKnowledge Without Limits\n\n\\(\\phi \\supset \\Diamond K \\phi\\) \n\nWe would then be able to derive in just a few lines that everything\ntrue is actually known, i.e., \\(\\phi \\supset K \\phi\\).\n\\begin{array}{rll} 1.& (\\phi \\wedge \\neg K \\phi) \\supset \\Diamond\nK (\\phi \\wedge \\neg K \\phi)& \\textbf{Knowledge Without Limits}\\\\\n2.& \\neg (\\phi \\wedge \\neg K\\phi)& 1,\\ \\textbf{Unknowns are\nUnknowable, P}\\\\ 3.& \\phi \\supset K\\phi& 2,\\ \\textbf{P}\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\n\nIf \\(K\\) represents what God knows, this would be fine. But if \\(K\\)\nrepresents what you or I know, it seems absurd! Not only are there\ntruths we don\u2019t know, most truths don\u2019t even follow from\nwhat we know. Knowledge Without Limits appears to be\nthe culprit here, so it seems there are some things we could not know,\neven in principle. But see\n the entry on Fitch\u2019s paradox of knowability\n for more discussion.\n",
