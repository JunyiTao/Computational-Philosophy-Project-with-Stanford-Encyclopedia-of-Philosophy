    "main_text": "General Critiques of Intellectual Property || Information is Not Property\n4.1 Information is Not Property\n\nCritics argue that information is not the kind of thing that can be\nowned or possessed and is not something that can be property, as that\nnotion is typically defined. Information objects, such as numbers and\npropositions are abstract objects, which cannot causally interact with\nmaterial objects, and hence cannot be owned or possessed. The idea,\nfor example, that one could, in the relevant sense, possess and hence\nown the novel expressed by the book A Tale of Two Cities\nmakes as little sense as the idea that one could possess and hence own\nthe entity denoted by the symbol \u201c2.\u201d Whatever concepts\nmight properly be applied to abstract objects, on this view, the\nconcept of property, according to these theorists, does not. As a\nconceptual matter, the term \u201cintellectual property,\u201d at\nbest, applies to nothing and, at worst, is incoherent.\n\nThis analysis is vulnerable to at least two objections. First, it is\nnot clear that ownership, as a conceptual matter, requires physical\npossession. One can argue that the essence of ownership consists in a\npower \u2014 the power to exclude others from certain behaviors\ninvolving the relevant entity \u2014 and not in physical control or\npossession of the entity. Second, the claim that information objects\ncannot be property does not imply that it is illegitimate to grant to\nauthors or content-creators a legal right to exclude others from\nappropriating those objects without their consent. That some entity E\nis not \u201cproperty\u201d implies only that it should not be\nlegally protected qua property; it does not imply that E should not be\nprotected in very similar ways. It might be that such legal rights\nshould be called something other than \u201cintellectual property\nrights,\u201d but these rights could be called something else, such\nas, for example, \u201cintellectual content rights.\u201d\n",
