He argues that\nthe selfish beings Hobbes described in his state of nature bear no\nresemblance to humans as they actually are. He takes the theory to be\nbased on the claim that humans originally existed in a state of nature\nthat was an unsociable war of all against all. Such a picture is\nflatly contradicted by the facts of human nature as Shaftesbury\nunderstands them. Our innate constitution compels us toward society.\nOur inborn \u201cFacultys\u201d move us directly toward\n\u201cFellowship or Community\u201d (C 2.317). Sociability is as\nnatural to humans\u2014as inextricably built into human\nnature\u2014as self-interest (C 2.78; 2.318-19).\n\nShaftesbury also argues that there is an incoherence in Hobbes\u2019s\ncombination of the claims that it is not wrong to kill or maim other\nhumans in the state of nature and that the original compact justifies\nallegiance to government:\n\n\u2019Tis ridiculous to say, there is any Obligation on Man to act\nsociably, or honestly, in a form\u2019d Government; and not in that\nwhich is commonly call\u2019d the State of Nature. For, to\nspeak in the fashionable Language of our modern Philosophy:\n\u201cSociety being founded on a Compact; the Surrender made of every\nMan\u2019s private unlimited Right, into the hands of the Majority,\nor such as the Majority shou\u2019d appoint, was of free Choice, and\nby a Promise.\u201d Now the Promise it-self was made in the\nState of Nature: And that which cou\u2019d make a\nPromise obligatory in the State of Nature, must make\nallother Acts of Humanity as much our real Duty, and natural\nPart. Thus Faith, Justice, Honesty, and\nVirtue, must have been as early as the State of Nature, or they\ncou\u2019d never have been at all. The Civil Union, or\nConfederacy, cou\u2019d never make Right or Wrong; if\nthey subsisted not before. He who was free to any Villany before his\nContract, will, and ought to make as free with his Contract, when he\nthinks fit. The Natural Knave has the same reason to be a\nCivil one; and may dispense with his politick Capacity as oft as\nhe sees occasion: \u2019Tis only his Word stands in his\nway\u2014A Man is oblig\u2019d to keep his Word. Why? Because\nhe has given his Word to keep it\u2014Is not this a notable\nAccount of the Original of moral Justice, and the Rise of Civil\nGovernment and Allegiance! (C 1.109\u2013110; see also\n2.310\u2013321)\n\nShaftesbury\u2019s argument is in the form of a dilemma. Either\npromises in the state of nature have obligatory force, or they do not.\nIf promises in the state of nature do have obligatory force, then\nHobbes can account for our obligation to obey government but only by\nabandoning his story about a state of nature in which violence toward\nothers is not wrong. For someone who acknowledges that promises are\nnaturally obligatory will have no grounds for denying that other\nthings are naturally obligatory as well: \u201cIf in original and\npure Nature, it be wrong to break a Promise, or be treacherous;\n\u2018tis as truly wrong to be in any respect in human, or any way\nwanting in our natural part towards human kind\u201d (C 1.110). If,\non the other hand, Hobbes claims that promises do not have obligatory\nforce in the state of nature, then he has to abandon his account of\nour obligation to obey government. For if a promise in the state of\nnature has no obligatory force, and if the only difference between a\nknave in the state of nature and knave in the commonwealth is that the\nlatter made a promise in the state of nature, then the\ncommonwealth-knave is no more in violation of his obligations than the\nnature-knave.\n\nHumans are naturally sociable. Society is humankind\u2019s natural\ncondition.\n\n\nIn short, if Generation be natural, if natural Affection and\nthe Care and Nurture of the Offspring be natural, Things\nstanding as they do with Man, and the Creature being of that Form and\nConstitution he now is; it follows, \u201cThat Society must be also\nnatural to him; And That out of Society and Community he\nnever did, nor ever can subsist\u201d. (C\n2.318\u201319)\n\n\nSocial contract theory, according to Shaftesbury, is based on false\nviews of human psychology.\n",
