    "main_text": "\u201cParticularism\u201d and \u201cGeneralism\u201d are said in many ways\n2. \u201cParticularism\u201d and \u201cGeneralism\u201d are said in many ways\n\nParticularists are united in their opposition to moral principles and\ngeneralists are united in their allegiance to them. What, though, is a\nmoral principle? At least three conceptions of principles are worth\ndistinguishing. First, there are principles qua\nstandards. Standards purport to offer explanations\nof why given actions are right or wrong, why a given consideration is\na reason with a certain valence and weight, why a given character\ntrait is a virtue, and the like. An especially robust metaphysical\nspin on this conception understands standards as being\ntruth-makers for moral propositions (cf. Armstrong 2004).\nSecond, there are principles qua guides. These\npurport to be well suited to guiding action. Third, there are\nprinciples purporting to play both of these roles\nsimultaneously\u2014action-guiding standards.\n\nIt is not hard to see these different conceptions of moral principles\nat work in the history of moral philosophy. In the utilitarian\ntradition in moral philosophy, the principle of utility (however it is\nformulated) is characteristically understood as a standard. Even if\nsome politically minded utilitarians see advantages to using the\nprinciple of utility to guide public choice and justification, moral\nphilosophers tend to follow Mill in thinking that the principle is\nseldom apt for use in individual moral decision-making. They thus deny\nthat it should be understood as a principle qua\nguide. Indeed, some utilitarians go further and argue that\nthe principle of utility is self-effacing, in the sense that\nit recommends its own rejection (cf. Railton 1984; see also Parfit\n1984). Utilitarians instead hold that various maxims of common sense\nmorality should be understood as heuristics which work well enough for\nnormal human beings, so there is room in this picture for principles\nqua guides.\n\nKant, on the other hand, seemed to have understood the categorical\nimperative as a kind of action-guiding standard. Kant\u2019s\ndiscussion of examples in the Groundwork (1785) and his\ncharacterization of the Formula of Universal Law as appropriate method\nfor testing our maxims makes clear that he thinks of it as\nappropriately guiding the actions of the morally virtuous agent.\nEqually clearly, the categorical imperative is to be understood as the\nmost fundamental explanation of why given actions are right or wrong,\nand so also counts as a principle qua standard. On a\nconstitutivist reading, the categorical imperative is meant to play\nboth of these roles in virtue of its constituting our rational agency.\nFinally, it is worth noting in this context that a principle can\nfunction usefully as a guide even if its application requires\njudgment and sensitivity; principles qua guides need not be\nalgorithmic.\n\nPrinciples can also be distinguished in terms of their scope.\nSome principles have purely non-moral antecedents (e.g., the principle\nof utility), whereas others use moral concepts in both their\nantecedents and consequents (e.g., \u201cif an action is just then it\nis morally permissible\u201d). Finally, principles can be\ndistinguished in terms of whether they are in some sense\n\u201chedged\u201d, including a ceteris paribus clause of\nsome kind (e.g., \u201cother things equal, lying is wrong\u201d), or\nunhedged.\n\nOne might be a particularist or a generalist about moral principles\nunderstood in any of these ways. Whether being a particularist or\ngeneralist about principles in one sense drives one to be a\nparticularist or a generalist about principles in another sense is not\na trivial question. Further complicating matters, there is more than\none way to oppose principles (however those principles are conceived.)\nLast, the form a particularist\u2019s opposition takes might\nreasonably vary across different types of principle. Let us now review\ndifferent ways one might oppose principles.\n\nThe simplest form of opposition, Principle Eliminativism,\nsimply denies that there are any moral principles. Of course, it must\nbe borne in mind here and below that a principle eliminativist may\ndeny that there are any principles of one sort, while allowing for\nprinciples of another sort. For example one might be an eliminativist\nabout principles purporting to give the application conditions for\nmoral predicates in entirely non-normative terms (McNaughton 1988) or\nan eliminativist about exceptionless principles (Little 2000).\nPrinciple Scepticism holds, more modestly, that we do not\nhave sufficient reason to believe there are any moral principles.\nPrincipled Particularism holds that while any given moral\ntruth is explained by a moral principle, no finite set of moral\nprinciples can explain all the moral truths (Holton 2002).\nAnti-Transcendental Particularism, which at one point at\nleast was Dancy\u2019s favoured gloss of the view, holds that moral\nthought and judgment does not depend on the supply of a suitable stock\nof moral principles. Finally, Principle Abstinence asserts a\nmore practical opposition to moral principles, holding that we ought\nnot be guided by moral principles. For each of these forms of\nparticularism, there is a corresponding form of generalism which is\nsimply the denial of the particularist thesis in question.\n\nAlthough this taxonomy entails that the logical space for\nparticularist (and generalist) views is wide and heterogeneous, it\nwould be a mistake to assume that all of the positions which can be\nderived from a matrix constructed on the basis of these distinctions\nreally are distinct in any deep way. For example, Principle\nEliminativism about principles qua guides\narguably is equivalent to Principle Abstinence about\nprinciples tout court.\n",
