    "main_text": "History\n2. History\n\nIn 1821, Karl Krause (1781\u20131832) used the explicit label of\n\u201cpanentheism\u201d for apparently the first time. (See Pfeifer\n2020, 123, especially n. 1 for a brief discussion about the first\nexplicit use of the term \u201cpanentheism\u201d.) However, various\nadvocates and critics of panentheism find evidence of incipient or\nimplicit forms of panentheism present in religious thought as early as\n1300 BCE. Hartshorne discovers the first indication of panentheistic\nthemes in Ikhnaton (1375\u20131358 BCE), the Egyptian pharaoh often\nconsidered the first monotheist. In his poetic description of the sun\ngod, Ikhnaton avoids both the separation of God from the world that\nwill characterize theism and the identification of God with the world\nthat will characterize pantheism (Hartshorne 1953, 29\u201330). Early\nVedantic thought implies panentheism in non-Advaita forms that\nunderstand non-dualism as inclusive of differences. Although there are\ntexts referring to Brahman as contracted and identical to Brahman,\nother texts speak of Brahman as expanded. In these texts, the perfect\nincludes and surpasses the total of imperfect things as an\nappropriation of the imperfect. Although not the dominant\ninterpretation of the Upanishads, multiple intimations of\npanentheism are present in the Upanishads (Whittemore 1988,\n33, 41\u201344). Hartshorne finds additional religious concepts of\nGod that hold the unchanging and the changing together in a way that\nallows for the development and significance of the non-divine in\nLao-Tse (fourth century BCE) and in the Judeo-Christian scriptures\n(1953, 32\u201338).\n\nIn philosophical reflection, Plato (427/428\u2013348/347 BCE) plays a\nrole in the development of implicit panentheism although there is\ndisagreement about the nature of that role. Hartshorne drew a dipolar\nunderstanding of God that includes both immutability and mutability\nfrom Plato. Hartshorne understood Plato\u2019s concept of the divine\nto include the Forms as pure and unchanging being and the World soul\nas changing and in motion. Although he concluded that Plato never\nreconciled these two elements in his understanding of the divine, both\naspects were present (1953, 54). J. Cooper maintains that Plato\nretained an essential distinction between the Good and the other\nbeings that Plato called gods. According to J. Cooper, Plotinus\n(204\u2013270 CE) rather than Plato provided the basis for\npanentheism with his description of the physical world as an emanation\nof being from the One making the world part of the Ultimate (2006,\n35\u201339). However, Baltzly finds evidence in the Timaeus\nof a polytheistic view that can be identified as panentheistic\n(2010).\n\nFrom Plato to Schelling (1775\u20131854 CE), various theologians and\nphilosophers developed ideas that are similar to themes in\ncontemporary panentheism. These ideas developed as expressions of\ntheism. Proclus (412\u2013485 CE) and Pseudo-Dionysus (late Fifth to\nearly Sixth century) drawing upon Plotinus developed perspectives in\nwhich the world came from God and understood the relationship between\nGod and the world as a dialectical relationship in which the world\ncame from God and returned to God (J. Cooper 2006, 42\u201346). In\nthe Middle Ages, the influence of Neoplatonism continued in the\nthought of Eriugena (815\u2013877 CE), Eckhart (1260\u20131328 CE),\nNicholas of Cusa (1401\u20131464 CE), and Boehme (1575\u20131624\nCE). Although accused of pantheism by their contemporaries, their\nsystems can be identified as panentheistic because they understood God\nin various ways as including the world rather than being the world and\nbecause they used a dialectical method. The dialectical method\ninvolved the generation of opposites and then the reconciliation of\nthe opposition in God. This retained the distinct identity of God in\nGod\u2019s influence of the world (J. Cooper 2006, 47\u201362).\nDuring the early modern period, Bruno (1548\u20131600 CE) and Spinoza\n(1631\u20131677 CE) responded to the dualism of classical theism by\nemphasizing the relationship between God and the world to the point\nthat the nature of any ontological distinction between God and the\nworld became problematic. Later thinkers such as the Cambridge\nPlatonists (Seventeenth century), Jonathan Edwards (1703\u20131758\nCE) (Crisp 2009), and Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768\u20131834 CE)\nthought of the world as in some way in God or a development from God.\nAlthough they did not stress the ontological distinction between God\nand the world, they did emphasize the responsive relationship that\nhumans have to God. Human responsiveness assumed some degree of human\ninitiative if not freedom, which indicates some distinction between\nGod and humans. The assumption of some degree of human initiative was\na reaction against the loss of freedom due to Spinoza\u2019s close\nidentification between God and the world (J. Cooper 2006,\n64\u201390).\n\nThe nineteenth and twentieth centuries saw the development of\npanentheism as a specific position regarding God\u2019s relationship\nto the world. The awareness of panentheism as an alternative to\nclassical theism and pantheism developed out of a complex of\napproaches. Philosophical idealism and philosophical adaptation of the\nscientific concept of evolution provided the basic sources of the\nexplicit position of panentheism. Philosophical approaches applying\nthe concept of development to God reached their most complete\nexpression in process philosophy\u2019s understanding of God being\naffected by the events of the world.\n\nHegel (1770\u20131831) and Schelling (1775\u20131854) sought to\nretain the close relationship between God and the world that Spinoza\nproposed without identifying God with the world. Their concept of God\nas developing in and through the world provided the means for\naccomplishing this. Prior to this time, God had been understood as\nunchanging and the world as changing while existing in God (J. Cooper\n2006, 90). Schelling\u2019s understanding of God as personal provided\nthe basis for the unity of the diversity in the world in a manner that\nwas more open than Hegel\u2019s understanding. Schelling emphasized\nthe freedom of the creatures in relation to the necessity of\nGod\u2019s nature as love. For Schelling, God\u2019s free unfolding\nof God\u2019s internal subjective necessity did not result in an\nexternal empirical necessity determining the world (Clayton 2000,\n474). This relationship resulted in vitality and on-going development.\nHartshorne classified this as a dipolar understanding of God in that\nGod is both necessary and developing (1953, 234). J. Cooper describes\nSchelling\u2019s thought as dynamic cooperative panentheism (2006,\n95). Hegel found Schelling inadequate and sought a greater unity for\nthe diversity. He united Fichte\u2019s subjective idealism and\nSchelling\u2019s objective idealism to provide a metaphysics of\nsubjectivity rather than substance (Clayton 2008a, 125). Hegel\u2019s\nunification of Fichte and Schelling resulted in a more comprehensive\nand consistent system still based upon change in God. God as well as\nnature is characterized by dialectical development. In his rejection\nof pantheism, Hegel understood the infinite as including the finite by\nabsorbing the finite into its own fuller nature. This retained divine\ntranscendence in the sense of the divine surpassing its parts although\nnot separate from the parts (Whittemore 1960, 141\u2013142). The\ndivine transcendence provided unity through the development of the\nAbsolute through history. Karl Krause (1781\u20131832) in 1828\nlabeled Schelling\u2019s and Hegel\u2019s positions as\n\u201cpanentheism\u201d in order to emphasize their differences from\nSpinoza\u2019s identification of God with the world (Atmanspacher and\nvon Sas 2017, 1032). J. Cooper describes Hegel\u2019s panentheism as\ndialectical historical panentheism (2006, 107).\n\nAs Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution introduced history into the\nconceptualization of biology, Samuel Alexander (1859\u20131938),\nHenri Bergson (1859\u20131941), and C. Lloyd Morgan (1852\u20131936)\nintroduced development into the ways in which all of physical reality\nwas conceptualized. They then worked out positions that in a variety\nof ways understood God and the world as growing in relationship to\neach other. Although Hartshorne\u2019s classification of\n\u201cpanentheism\u201d did not include Alexander in the category of\n\u201cpanentheism,\u201d only occasionally mentioned Bergson, and\nmade no reference to Morgan, Whitehead referred to all three of these\nthinkers positively. It may be too strong to claim that they\ninfluenced Whitehead (Emmett 1992), but they did provide the\nbackground for Whitehead\u2019s and then Hartshorne\u2019s\nsystematic development of process philosophy as an expression of\npanentheism. Hartshorne popularized the modern use of the term\n\u201cpanentheism\u201d and considered Whitehead to be the\noutstanding panentheist (Hartshorne 1953, 273). Although Hartshorne\nmade several modifications to Whitehead\u2019s understanding of God,\nthe basic structures of Whitehead\u2019s thought were continued in\nHartshorne\u2019s further development of Whitehead\u2019s philosophy\n(Ford 1973, Cobb 1965). God, for process philosophy, is necessary for\nany actual world. Without God, the world would be nothing more than an\nunchanging existence radically different from the actual world of\nexperience. God as both eternal and temporal provides possibilities\nthat call the world to change and develop. God as eternal provides an\nactual source of those possibilities. However, if God is only eternal,\nthe possibilities would be unrelated to the actual world as it\npresently exists. Thus, Whitehead and Hartshorne understand the world\nto be present in God in order for the possibilities that lead to\ndevelopment to be related to the world (Hartshorne 1953, 273). The\nimplication of God\u2019s inclusion of the world is that God is\npresent to the world and the world influences God. Although the\npresence of the world in God could be understood as a form of\npantheism, process philosophy avoids collapsing the world into God or\nGod into the world by maintaining a distinction between God and the\nworld. This distinction is manifest in the eternality of God and the\ntemporality of the world. It is also apparent in the freedom of the\nevents in the world. Although God presents possibilities to the events\nin the world, each event \u201cdecides\u201d how it will actualize\nthose possibilities. The freedom of each event, the absence of divine\ndetermination, provides a way for process thought to avoid God being\nthe cause of evil. Since God includes the events of the world, God\nwill include the evil as well as the good that occurs in the world and\nthis evil will affect God since the world affects God\u2019s\nactualization. But, because God does not determine the response of\neach event to the possibilities that God presents, any event may\nreject God\u2019s purpose of good through the intensification of\nexperience and actualize a less intense experience. God does take this\nless intense, evil, experience into God\u2019s self, but redeems that\nevil by means of relating it to the ways in which good has been\nactualized. Thus, God saves what can be saved from the world rather\nthan simply including each event in isolation from other events (J.\nCooper 2006, 174, 180).\n",
