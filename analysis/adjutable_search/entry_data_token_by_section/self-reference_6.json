    "main_text": "Why the Paradoxes Matter\n2. Why the Paradoxes Matter\n\nAfter having presented a number of paradoxes of self-reference and\ndiscussed some of their underlying similarities, we will now turn to a\ndiscussion of their significance. The significance of a\nparadox is its indication of a flaw or deficiency in our understanding\nof the central concepts involved in it. In case of the semantic\nparadoxes, it seems that it is our understanding of fundamental\nsemantic concepts such as truth (in the liar paradox and\nGrelling\u2019s paradox) and definability (in Berry\u2019s\nand Richard\u2019s paradoxes) that are deficient. In case of the\nset-theoretic paradoxes, it is our understanding of the concept of a\nset. If we fully understood these concepts, we should be able\nto deal with them without being led to contradictions. \n\nTo illustrate this, consider the case of Zeno\u2019s classical\nparadox on Achilles and the Tortoise (see the entry\n Zeno\u2019s paradoxes\n for details). In this paradox we seem able to prove that the tortoise\ncan win a race against the 10 times faster Achilles if given an\narbitrarily small head start. Zeno used this paradox as an argument\nagainst the possibility of motion. It has later turned out that the\nparadox rests on an inadequate understanding of infinity. More\nprecisely, it rests on an implicit assumption that any infinite series\nof positive reals must have an infinite sum. The later developments of\nthe mathematics of infinite series has shown that this assumption is\ninvalid, and thus the paradox dissolves. The original acceptance of\nZeno\u2019s argument as a paradox was a symptom that the concept of\ninfinity was not sufficiently well understood at the time. In analogy,\nit seems reasonable to expect that the existence of semantic and\nset-theoretic paradoxes is a symptom that the involved semantic and\nset-theoretic concepts are not yet sufficiently well understood. \n\nAnother possible answer could be that it is our understanding of the\nvery concept of \u201ccontradiction\u201d that is flawed. The\nreasoning involved in the paradoxes of self-reference all end up with\nsome contradiction, a sentence concluded to be both true and false. We\nconsider this an impossibility, hence the paradox, but maybe we\ndon\u2019t have to? Dialetheism is the view that there can\nbe \u201ctrue contradictions\u201d, meaning that it is not\nimpossible for a sentence to be both true and false. If adopting the\nview of dialetheism, all the paradoxes of self-reference dissolve and\ninstead become existence proofs of certain \u201cdialetheia\u201d:\nsentences being both true and false. Priest (1987) is a strong\nadvocate of dialetheism, and uses his principle of uniform solution\n(see Section 1.4 above) to defend the dialetheist solution. See the\nentries on\n dialetheism\n and\n paraconsistent logic\n for more information.\n\nCurrently, no commonly agreed upon solution to the paradoxes of\nself-reference exists. They continue to pose foundational problems in\nsemantics and set theory. No claim can be made to a solid foundation\nfor these subjects until a satisfactory solution to the paradoxes has\nbeen provided. Problems surface when it comes to formalising semantics\n(the concept of truth) and set theory. If formalising the intuitive,\n\u201cnaive\u201d understanding of these subjects, inconsistent\nsystems linger as the paradoxes will be formalisable in these\nsystems.\n",
