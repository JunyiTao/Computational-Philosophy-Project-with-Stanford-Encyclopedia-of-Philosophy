    "main_text": "Two Kinds of Analysis of the Concept || Monothetic approaches\n2.1 Monothetic approaches\n\nMonothetic approaches use a single property (or a single set\nof properties) as the criterion that determines whether a concept\napplies. The key to a monothetic approach is that it proposes\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for membership in the given class.\nThat is, a monothetic approach claims that there is some\ncharacteristic, or set of them, found in every religion and that if a\nform of life has it, then that form of life is a religion. Most\ndefinitions of the concept religion have been of this type.\nFor example, as we saw above, Edward Tylor proposes belief in\nspiritual beings as his minimal definition of religion, and this\nis a substantive criterion that distinguishes religion from\nnon-religion in terms of belief in this particular kind of entity.\nSimilarly, Paul Tillich proposes ultimate concern as a\nfunctional criterion that distinguishes religion from non-religion in\nterms of what serves this particular role in one\u2019s life. These\nare single criterion monothetic definitions.\n\nThere are also monothetic definitions that define religion in terms of\na single set of criteria. Herbert\u2019s five Common Notions are an\nearly example. More recently, Clifford Geertz (1973: ch. 4) proposes a\ndefinition that he breaks down into five elements:\n\na system of symbols\nabout the nature of things,\nthat inculcate dispositions for behavior\nthrough ritual and cultural\n performance,[3]\nso that the conceptions held by the group are taken as real.\n\n\nOne can find each of these five elements separately, of course: not\nall symbols are religious symbols; historians (but not novelists)\ntypically consider their conceptions factual; and so on. For Geertz,\nhowever, any religious form of life will have all five. Aware of\nfunctional approaches like that of Tillich, Geertz is explicit that\nsymbols and rituals that lack reference to a metaphysical\nframework\u2014that is, those without the substantive element he\nrequires as his (2)\u2014would be secular and not religious, no\nmatter how intense or important one\u2019s feelings about them are\n(1973: 98). Reference to a metaphysical entity or power is what marks\nthe other four elements as religious. Without it, Geertz writes,\n\u201cthe empirical differentia of religious activity or religious\nexperience would not exist\u201d (1973: 98). As a third example,\nBruce Lincoln (2006: ch. 1) enumerates four elements that a religion\nwould have, namely:\n\n\u201ca discourse whose concerns transcend the human, temporal,\nand contingent, and that claims for itself a similarly transcendent\nstatus\u201d,\npractices connected to that discourse,\npeople who construct their identity with reference to that\ndiscourse and those practices, and\ninstitutional structures to manage those people.\n\n\nThis definition is monothetic since, for Lincoln, religions always\nhave these four features \u201cat a minimum\u201d (2006:\n 5).[4]\n To be sure, people constantly engage in practices that generate\nsocial groups that then have to be maintained and managed by rules or\nauthorities. However, when the practices, communities, and\ninstitutions lack the distinctive kind of discourse that claims\ntranscendent status for itself, they would not count for Lincoln as\nreligions.\n\nIt is worth noting that when a monothetic definition includes multiple\ncriteria, one does not have to choose between the substantive and\nfunctional strategies for defining religion, but can instead\ninclude both. If a monothetic definition include both strategies,\nthen, to count as a religion, a form of life would have to refer to a\ndistinctive substantive reality and also play a certain role in the\nparticipants\u2019 lives. This double-sided approach avoids the\nresult of purely substantive definitions that might count as religion\na feckless set of beliefs (for instance, \u201csomething must have\ncreated the world\u201d) unconnected from the believers\u2019\ndesires and behavior, while also avoiding the result of purely\nfunctional definitions that might count as religion some universal\naspect of human existence (for instance, creating collective\neffervescence or ranking of one\u2019s values). William James\u2019s\ndefinition of religion (\u201cthe belief that there is an unseen\norder, and our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves\nthereto\u201d) is double-sided in this way, combining a belief in the\nexistence of a distinctive referent with the spiritual disciplines\nwith which one seeks to embody that belief. Geertz\u2019s definition\nof religion also required both substantive and functional aspects,\nwhich he labelled \u201cworldview\u201d and \u201cethos\u201d\n(1973: ch. 5). To treat religion as \u201cboth/and\u201d in this way\nis to refuse to abstract one aspect of a complex social reality but\ninstead recognizes, as Geertz puts it, both \u201cthe dispositional\nand conceptual aspects of religious life\u201d (1973:\n 113).[5]\n\nThese \u201cmonothetic-set definitions\u201d treat the concept of\nreligion as referring to a multifaceted or multidimensional complex.\nIt may seem avant garde today to see religion described as a\n\u201cconstellation\u201d, \u201cassemblage\u201d,\n\u201cnetwork\u201d, or \u201csystem\u201d, but in fact to treat\nreligion as a complex is not new. Christian theologians traditionally\nanalyzed the anatomy of their way of life as simultaneously\nfides, fiducia, and fidelitas. Each of\nthese terms might be translated into English as \u201cfaith\u201d,\nbut each actually corresponds to a different dimension of a social\npractice. Fides refers to a cognitive state, one in which a\nperson assents to a certain proposition and takes it as true. It could\nbe translated as \u201cbelief\u201d or \u201cintellectual\ncommitment\u201d. Beliefs or intellectual commitments distinctive to\nparticipation in the group will be present whether or not a religious\nform of life has developed any authoritative doctrines. In contrast,\nfiducia refers to an affective state in which a person is\nmoved by a feeling or experience that is so positive that it bonds the\nrecipient to its source. It could be translated as \u201ctrust\u201d\nor \u201cemotional commitment\u201d. Trust or emotional commitment\nwill be present whether or not a religious form of life teaches that\nparticipation in their practices aims at some particular experience of\nliberation, enlightenment, or salvation. And fidelitas refers\nto a conative state in which a person commits themselves to a path of\naction, a path that typically involves emulating certain role models\nand inculcating the dispositions that the group considers virtuous. It\ncould be translated as \u201cloyalty\u201d or\n\u201csubmission\u201d. Loyalty or submission will be present\nwhether or not a religious form of life is theistic or teaches moral\nrules. By the time of Martin Luther, Christian catechisms organized\nthese aspects of religious life in terms of the \u201cthree\nC\u2019s\u201d: the creed one believed, the cult or worship one\noffered, and the code one followed. When Tillich (1957: ch. 2) argues\nthat religious faith is distorted when one treats it not as a complex\nbut instead as a function of the intellect alone, emotion alone, or\nthe will alone, he is speaking from within this tradition. These three\ndimensions of religious practices\u2014symbolically, the head, the\nheart, and the hand\u2014are not necessarily Christian. In fact,\nuntil one adds a delimiting criterion like those discussed above,\nthese dimensions are not even distinctively religious. Creed, cult,\nand code correspond to any pursuit of what a people considers true,\nbeautiful, and good, respectively, and they will be found in any\ncollective movement or cultural tradition. As Melford Spiro says, any\nhuman institution will involve a belief system, a value system, and an\naction system (Spiro 1966: 98).\n\nMany have complained that arguments about how religion should\nbe defined seem unresolvable. To a great extent, however, this is\nbecause these arguments have not simply been about a particular aspect\nof society but rather have served as proxy in a debate about the\nstructure of human subjectivity. There is deep agreement among the\nrival positions insofar as they presuppose the\ncognitive-affective-conative model of being human. However, what we\nmight call a \u201cCartesian\u201d cohort argues that cognition is\nthe root of religious emotions and actions. This cohort includes the\n\u201cintellectualists\u201d whose influence stretches from Edward\nTylor and James Frazer to E. E. Evans-Pritchard, Robin Horton, Jack\nGoody, Melford Spiro, Stewart Guthrie, and J. Z. Smith, and it shapes\nmuch of the emerging field of cognitive science of religion (e.g.,\nBoyer\n 2001).[6]\n A \u201cHumean\u201d cohort disagrees, arguing that affect is what\ndrives human behavior and that cognition serves merely to justify the\nvalues one has already adopted. In theology and religious studies,\nthis feelings-centered approach is identified above all with the work\nof Friedrich Schleiermacher and Rudolf Otto, and with the tradition\ncalled phenomenology of religion, but it has had a place in\nanthropology of religion since Robert Marett (Tylor\u2019s student),\nand it is alive and well in the work of moral intuitionists (e.g.,\nHaidt 2012) and affect theory (e.g., Schaefer 2015). A\n\u201cKantian\u201d cohort treats beliefs and emotions regarding\nsupernatural realities as relatively unimportant and argues instead\nthat for religion the will is\n basic.[7]\n This approach treats a religion as at root a set of required actions\n(e.g., V\u00e1squez 2011; C. Smith 2017). These different approaches\ndisagree about the essence of religion, but all three camps operate\nwithin a shared account of the human. Thus, when William James\ndescribes religion as\n\n\nthe feelings, acts, and experiences of individual [people] in their\nsolitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to\nwhatever they may consider the divine. (1902 [1985: 34])\n\n\nhe is foregrounding an affective view and playing down (though not\ndenying) the cognitive. When James\u2019s Harvard colleague Alfred\nNorth Whitehead corrects him, saying that \u201c[r]eligion is what a\nperson does with their solitariness\u201d (1926: 3, emphasis\nadded), Whitehead stresses the conative, though Whitehead also insists\nthat feelings always play a role. These are primarily disagreements of\nemphasis that do not trouble this model of human subjectivity. There\nhave been some attempts to leave this three-part framework. For\nexample, some in the Humean camp have suggested that religion is\nessentially a particular feeling with zero cognition. But that\nromantic suggestion collapses under the inability to articulate how an\naffective state can be noncognitive but still identifiable as a\nparticular feeling (Proudfoot 1985).\n\nAlthough the three-sided model of the true, the beautiful, and the\ngood is a classic account of what any social group explicitly and\nimplicitly teaches, one aspect is still missing. To recognize the\nalways-presupposed material reality of the people who constitute the\nsocial group, even when this reality has not been conceptualized by\nthe group\u2019s members, one should also include the contributions\nof their bodies, habits, physical culture, and social structures. To\ninclude this dimension mnemonically, one can add a \u201cfourth\nC\u201d, for community. Catherine Albanese (1981) may have been the\nfirst to propose the idea of adding this materialist dimension. Ninian\nSmart\u2019s famous anatomy of religion (1996) has seven dimensions,\nnot four, but the two models are actually very similar. Smart calls\nthe affective dimension the \u201cexperiential and emotional\u201d,\nand then divides the cognitive dimension into two (\u201cdoctrinal\nand philosophical\u201d and \u201cnarrative and\nmythological\u201d), the conative into two (\u201cethical and\nlegal\u201d and \u201critual\u201d), and the communal into two\n(\u201csocial and institutional\u201d and \u201cmaterial\u201d).\nIn an attempt to dislodge the focus on human subjectivity found in the\nthree Cs, some have argued that the material dimension is the source\nof the others. They argue, in other words, that the cognitive,\naffective, and conative aspects of the members of a social group are\nnot the causes but rather the effects of the group\u2019s structured\npractices (e.g., Asad 1993: ch. 1\u20134; Lopez 1998). Some argue\nthat to understand religion in terms of beliefs, or even in terms of\nany subjective states, reflects a Protestant bias and that scholars of\nreligion should therefore shift attention from hidden mental states to\nthe visible institutional structures that produce them. Although the\nstructure/agency debate is still live in the social sciences, it is\nunlikely that one can give a coherent account of religion in terms of\ninstitutions or disciplinary practices without reintroducing mental\nstates such as judgements, decisions, and dispositions (Schilbrack\n2021).\n\nWhether a monothetic approach focuses on one essential property or a\nset, and whether that essence is the substance or the function of the\nreligion, those using this approach ask a Yes/No question regarding a\nsingle criterion. This approach therefore typically produces\nrelatively clear lines between what is and is not religion. Given\nTylor\u2019s monothetic definition, for instance, a form of life must\ninclude belief in spiritual beings to be a religion; a form of life\nlacking this property would not be a religion, even if it included\nbelief in a general order of existence that participants took as their\nultimate concern, and even if that form of life included rituals,\nethics, and scriptures. In a famous discussion, Melford Spiro (1966)\nworks with a Tylorean definition and argues exactly this: lacking a\nbelief in superhuman beings, Theravada Buddhism, for instance, is\nsomething other than a\n religion.[8]\n For Spiro, there is nothing pejorative about this classification.\n\n\nHaving combatted the notion that \u201cwe\u201d have religion (which\nis \u201cgood\u201d) and \u201cthey\u201d have superstition (which\nis \u201cbad\u201d), why should we be dismayed if it be discovered\nthat that society x does not have religion as we have defined\nthe term?
