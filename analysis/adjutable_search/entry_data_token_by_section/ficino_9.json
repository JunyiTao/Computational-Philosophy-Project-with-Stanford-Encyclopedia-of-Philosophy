    "main_text": "Philosophical themes || Ethics, Love\n3.4 Ethics, Love\n\n\nPart of the reason for this \u201cactivist\u201d conception of Soul\non Ficino\u2019s part had to do with a search to find forces binding human\nbeings to one another. For Ficino, love linked all things together;\nand love flowed first from God into all existing things, which\nconsequently shared the property of similarity, outwardly different as\nthey might be on the surface. It is for this reason that\n\u201cspirit,\u201d or spiritus, was so important in\nFicino\u2019s thought. Ficino suggests: \u201cSpirit is defined by doctors\nas a vapor of blood \u2013 pure, subtle, hot, and clear. After being\ngenerated by the heat of the heart out of the more subtle blood, it\nflies to the brain; and there the soul uses it continually for the\nexercise of the interior as well as the exterior senses\u201d (Ficino\nin Kaske and Clark 1988, 1.2, 11\u201315, p. 110). This blurring, to\nmodern eyes, of the metaphysical and the physical, in which the\n\u201cimmaterial\u201d soul can use a vaporous material entity to\nhave effects on the physical world, presents Ficino at his most\ncharacteristic. Love between people occurs when the lover\u2019s spirit is\nexhaled toward the beloved and the beloved returns the gesture\nreciprocally; unreciprocated love can thus become a kind of homicide,\nas one human being loses a vital element to another. \u201cWhen we\nspeak about Love,\u201d Ficino writes (and here he means earthly\nlove), \u201cyou should understand this as meaning the desire for\nbeauty. For this is the definition of love among all\nphilosophers.\u201d Ficino goes on: \u201cThe purpose of love is the\nenjoyment of beauty\u201d (Ficino 1576, 1322\u201323; Kristeller\n1988, 282).\n\n\nFor Ficino, in classic Platonic fashion, it is the manner in which one\nenjoys beauty which differentiates true from false love. Beauty is\n\u201cbait\u201d and a \u201chook\u201d for Ficino: \u201cThe\nsplendor of the highest good is refulgent in individual things, and\nwhere it blazes the more fittingly, there it especially attracts\nsomeone gazing upon it, excites his consideration, seizes and occupies\nhim as he approaches, and compels him both to venerate such splendor\nas the divinity beyond all others, and to strive for nothing else but\nto lay aside his former nature and to become that splendor\nitself\u201d (Allen and Hankins 2001\u201306, 14.1.4, vol. 4,\n222\u201323). Once this attraction has taken place, \u201c\u2026\nthe soul burns with a divine radiance which is reflected in the man of\nbeauty as in a mirror, and \u2026 caught up by that radiance\nsecretly as by a hook, he is drawn upwards in order to become\nGod\u201d (ibid.). And God would be a \u201cwicked tyrant\u201d if\nhe implanted in human beings this aspiration without allowing the\npossibility of its eventual fulfillment (ibid.).\n\n\nThe development of the whole person was of paramount importance to\nFicino, and it is for this reason that his \u201ceducational\u201d\nmission must be fore-grounded. As we have seen, Ficino taught only\nonce, and very briefly, at the Florentine studio (Davies\n1992); and there would be no chair in any European university devoted\nto the teaching of Plato until later in the sixteenth century.  This\nabsence of Plato and Platonism from university faculties is\nunderstandable: Aristotle\u2019s more pedagogically suitable work had,\nsince late antiquity and even among Platonists, been deemed basic to\neducation; this fact is unsurprising, given that Aristotle\u2019s work was\npreserved in the form of lecture notes. And the medieval university\ncurriculum reflected a similar propensity to begin with Aristotelian\ntexts in the arts faculties, before a student, having graduated with a\nbachelor of arts degree (baccalaureus artium), would move on\nto the higher faculties of medicine, law, or theology. This intense\nfocus on Aristotelian texts, especially logic, was useful, providing\nmedieval university students with a common vocabulary and similar\napproaches to argumentation.  Yet by Ficino\u2019s era, the number of\nuniversities had risen dramatically, and unsurprisingly the\nAristotelian curricula came under scrutiny (Celenza 2007). For some,\nearlier in the fifteenth century, it was the seemingly inelegant Latin\nof scholastic philosophers that was unappealing. But for Ficino, the\nproblems had less to do with language and more to do with morality.\nCharacter needed to be developed before dialectic was taught. As\nFicino wrote in his commentary on Plato\u2019s dialogue Philebus,\nPlato \u201cshows that [dialectic] must not be given to adolescents\nbecause they are led by it into three vices: pride, lewdness,\nimpiety. For when they first taste the ingenious subtlety of arguing,\nit is as if they have come upon a tyrannous power of rebutting and\nrefuting the rest of us\u201d (Comm. In Philebum, ed.\nFicino, in Allen 2000, 230; Hankins 1989, 272). The natural prideful\nignorance of youth, when fueled by a capacity to win arguments, could\nbe heightened and led into undesirable directions by the unrestrained\npower of dialectic.\n",
