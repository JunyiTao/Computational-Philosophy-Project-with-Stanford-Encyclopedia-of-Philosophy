    "main_text": "Modern Versions of the Church-Turing Thesis || Brain simulation and the Church-Turing thesis\n6.3 Brain simulation and the Church-Turing thesis\n\nIt is sometimes said that the Church-Turing thesis has implications\nconcerning the scope of computational simulation. For example, Searle\nwrites:\n\n\nCan the operations of the brain be simulated on a digital computer?\n\u2026 The answer seems to me \u2026 demonstrably\n\u201cYes\u201d \u2026 That is, naturally interpreted, the\nquestion means: Is there some description of the brain such that under\nthat description you could do a computational simulation of the\noperations of the brain. But given Church\u2019s thesis that anything\nthat can be given a precise enough characterization as a set of steps\ncan be simulated on a digital computer, it follows trivially that the\nquestion has an affirmative answer. (Searle 1992: 200)\n\n\nAnother example:\n\n\nwe can depend on there being a Turing machine that captures the\nfunctional relations of the brain,\n\n\nfor so long as\n\n\nthese relations between input and output are functionally well-behaved\nenough to be describable by \u2026 mathematical relationships\n\u2026 we know that some specific version of a Turing machine will\nbe able to mimic them. (Guttenplan 1994: 595)\n\n\nAndr\u00e9ka, N\u00e9meti and N\u00e9meti state a more general\nthesis about the power of Turing machines to simulate other\nsystems:\n\n\n[T]he Physical Church-Turing Thesis \u2026 is the conjecture that\nwhatever physical computing device (in the broader sense) or physical\nthought-experiment will be designed by any future civilization, it\nwill always be simulateable by a Turing machine. (Andr\u00e9ka,\nN\u00e9meti, & N\u00e9meti 2009: 500)\n\n\nAndr\u00e9ka, N\u00e9meti, and N\u00e9meti even say that the\nthesis they state here \u201cwas formulated and generally accepted in\nthe 1930s\u201d (ibid.).\n\nYet it was not a thesis about the simulation of physical\nsystems that Church and Turing formulated in the 1930s, but rather a\ncompletely different thesis concerning human computation\u2014and it\nwas the latter thesis that became generally accepted during the 1930s\nand 1940s.\n\nIt certainly muddies the waters to call a thesis about simulation\n\u201cChurch\u2019s thesis\u201d or the \u201cChurch-Turing\nthesis\u201d, because the arguments that Church and Turing used to\nsupport their actual theses go no way at all towards supporting the\ntheses set out in the several quotations above. Nevertheless, what can\nbe termed the \u201cSimulation thesis\u201d has its place in the\npresent catalogue of modern forms of the Church-Turing thesis:\n\n\nSimulation thesis:\n\nAny system whose operations can be characterized as a set of steps\n(Searle) or whose input-output relations are describable by\nmathematical relationships (Guttenplan) can be simulated by a Turing\nmachine.\n\n\nIf the Simulation thesis is intended to cover all possible systems\nthen it is surely false, since Doyle\u2019s envisaged equilibrating\nsystems falsify it\n (Section 5.3.3).\n If, on the other hand, the thesis is intended to cover only actual\nphysical systems, including brains, then the Simulation thesis is,\nlike the Extended Church-Turing thesis, an empirical\nthesis\u2014and so is very different from Turing\u2019s thesis and\nChurch\u2019s thesis. The truth of the \u201cactual physical\nsystems\u201d version of the Simulation thesis depends on the laws of\nphysics.\n\nOne potential objection that any upholder of the Simulation thesis\nwill need to confront parallels a difficulty that Gandy raised for\nThesis M\n (Section 5.1).\n Physical systems that are not discrete\u2014such as Gandy\u2019s\n\u201cessentially analogue machines\u201d\u2014appear to falsify\nthe Simulation thesis, since the variables of a system with continuous\ndynamics take arbitrary real numbers as their values, whereas a Turing\nmachine is restricted to computable real numbers, and so\ncannot fully simulate the continuous system.\n\nThis brings the discussion squarely to one of the most interesting\ntopics in the area, so-called \u201cphysical versions\u201d of the\nChurch-Turing thesis.\n",
