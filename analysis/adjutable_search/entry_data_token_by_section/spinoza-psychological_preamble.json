    "main_text": "\n\n\nIn Part III of his Ethics, \u201cOn the Origin and Nature of\nthe Affects,\u201d which is the subject of this article, Spinoza\naddresses two of the most serious challenges facing his thoroughgoing\nnaturalism. First, he attempts to show that human beings follow the\norder of nature. Human beings, on Spinoza\u2019s view, have causal natures\nsimilar in kind to other ordinary objects, other \u201cfinite\nmodes\u201d in the technical language of the Ethics, so they\nought to be analyzed and understood in the same way as the rest of\nnature. Second, Spinoza attempts to show that moral concepts, such as\nthe concepts of good and evil, virtue, and perfection, have a basis in\nhuman psychology. Just as human beings are no different from the rest\nof nature, so moral concepts are no different from other\nconcepts. Spinoza\u2019s detailed account of the human affects\u2014the\nactions and passions of the human mind\u2014is crucial to both\ntasks. For his argument to succeed, the theory of the affects must be\nboth a plausible account of human psychology and also a plausible\nbasis for ethics.\n\n",
