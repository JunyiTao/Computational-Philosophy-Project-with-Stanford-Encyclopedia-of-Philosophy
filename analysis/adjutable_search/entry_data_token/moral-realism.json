Moral\nrealists are those who think that, in these respects, things should be\ntaken at face value\u2014moral claims do purport to report facts and\nare true if they get the facts right. Moreover, they hold, at least\nsome moral claims actually are true. That much is the common and more\nor less defining ground of moral realism (although some accounts of\nmoral realism see it as involving additional commitments, say to the\nindependence of the moral facts from human thought and practice, or to\nthose facts being objective in some specified way).\n\n\nAs a result, those who reject moral realism are usefully divided\ninto (i) those who think moral claims do not purport to report facts in\nlight of which they are true or false (noncognitivists) and (ii) those\nwho think that moral claims do carry this purport but deny that any\nmoral claims are actually true (error theorists).\n\n\nIt is worth noting that, while moral realists are united in their\ncognitivism and in their rejection of error theories, they disagree\namong themselves not only about which moral claims are actually true\nbut about what it is about the world that makes those claims true.\nMoral realism is not a particular substantive moral view nor does it\ncarry a distinctive metaphysical commitment over and above the\ncommitment that comes with thinking moral claims can be true or false\nand some are true. Still, much of the debate about moral realism\nrevolves around either what it takes for claims to be true or false at\nall (with some arguing that moral claims do not have what it takes) or\nwhat it would take specifically for moral claims to be true (with some\narguing that moral claims would require something the world does not\nprovide).\n\n\nThe debate between moral realists and anti-realists assumes, though,\nthat there is a shared object of inquiry\u2014in this case, a range\nof claims all involved are willing to recognize as moral\nclaims\u2014about which two questions can be raised and answered: Do\nthese claims purport to report facts in light of which they are true\nor false? Are some of them true? Moral realists answer\n\u2018yes\u2019 to both, non-cognitivists answer \u2018no\u2019 to\nthe first (and, by default, \u2018no\u2019 to the second) while\nerror theorists answer \u2018yes\u2019 to the first and\n\u2018no\u2019 to the second. (With the introduction of\n\u201cminimalism\u201d about truth and facts, things become a bit\nmore complicated. See the section on semantics, below.) To note that\nsome other, non-moral, claims do not (or do) purport to report facts\nor that none (or some) of them are true, is to change the\nsubject. That said, it is strikingly hard to nail down with any\naccuracy just which claims count as moral and so are at issue in the\ndebate. For the most part, those concerned with whether moral realism\nis true are forced to work back and forth between an intuitive grasp\nof which claims are at issue and an articulate but controversial\naccount of what they have in common such that realism either is, or is\nnot, defensible about them.\n\n\nBy all accounts, moral realism can fairly claim to have common sense\nand initial appearances on its side. That advantage, however, might be\neasily outweighed; there are a number of powerful arguments for\nholding that it is a mistake to think of moral claims as true.\n", "toc": [{"#1": "1.

Moral Disagreement\n\n\nPerhaps the longest standing argument is found in the extent and\ndepth of moral disagreement. The mere fact of disagreement does not\nraise a challenge for moral realism. Disagreement is to be found in\nvirtually any area, even where no one doubts that the claims at stake\npurport to report facts and everyone grants that some claims are\ntrue.\n\n\nBut disagreements differ and many believe that the sort of\ndisagreements one finds when it comes to morality are best explained by\nsupposing one of two things: (i) that moral claims are not actually in\nthe business of reporting facts, but are rather our way of expressing\nemotions, or of controlling others\u2019 behavior, or, at least, of\ntaking a stand for and against certain things or (ii) that moral claims\nare in the business of reporting facts, but the required facts just are\nnot to be found.\n\n\nTaking the first line, many note that people differ in their\nemotions, attitudes and interests and then argue that moral\ndisagreements simply reflect the fact that the moral claims people\nembrace are (despite appearances) really devices for expressing or\nserving their different emotions, attitudes, and interests.\n\n\nTaking the second line, others note that claims can genuinely\npurport to report facts and yet utterly fail (consider claims about\nphlogiston or astrological forces or some mythical figure that others\nbelieved existed) and then argue that moral disagreements take the form\nthey do because the facts that would be required to give them some\norder and direction are not to be found.\n\n\nOn either view, the distinctive nature of moral disagreement is seen\nas well explained by the supposition that moral realism is false,\neither because cognitivism is false or because an error theory is\ntrue.\n\n\nInterestingly, the two lines of argument are not really compatible.\nIf one thinks that moral claims do not even purport to report facts,\none cannot intelligibly hold that the facts such claims purport to\nreport do not exist. Nonetheless, in important ways, the considerations\neach mobilizes might be used to support the other. For instance,\nsomeone defending an error theory might point to the ways in which\nmoral claims are used to express or serve peoples\u2019 emotions,\nattitudes, and interests, to explain why people keep arguing as they do\ndespite there being no moral facts. And someone defending\nnoncognitivism might point to the practical utility of talking as if\nthere were moral facts to explain why moral claims seem to purport to\nreport facts even though they do not.\n\n\nMoreover, almost surely each of these views is getting at something\nthat is importantly right about some people and their use of what\nappear to be moral claims. No one doubts that often peoples\u2019\nmoral claims do express their emotions, attitudes, and do serve their\ninterests and it is reasonable to suspect that at least some people\nhave in mind as moral facts a kind of fact we have reason to think does\nnot exist.\n\n\nMoral realists are committed to holding, though, that to whatever\nextent moral claims might have other uses and might be made by people\nwith indefensible accounts of moral facts, some moral claims, properly\nunderstood, are actually true. To counter the arguments that appeal to\nthe nature of moral disagreement, moral realists need to show that the\ndisagreements are actually compatible with their commitments.\n\n\nAn attractive first step is to note, as was done above, that mere\ndisagreement is no indictment. Indeed, to see the differences among\npeople as disagreements\u2014rather than as mere differences\u2014it seems\nas if one needs to hold that they are making claims that contradict one\nanother and this seems to require that each side see the other as\nmaking a false claim. To the extent there is moral disagreement and not\nmerely difference, moral realists argue, we need at least to reject\nnoncognitivism (even as we acknowledge that the views people embrace\nmight be heavily influenced by their emotions, attitudes, and\ninterests). While this is plausible, noncognitivists can and have\nreplied by distinguishing cognitive disagreement from other sorts of\ndisagreement and arguing that moral disagreements are of a sort that does\nnot require cognitivism. Realists cannot simply dismiss this\npossibility, though they can legitimately challenge noncognitivists to\nmake good sense of how moral arguments and disagreements are carried on\nwithout surreptitiously appealing to the participants seeing their\nclaims as purporting to report facts.\n\n\nIn any case, even if the nature of disagreements lends some\nplausibility to cognitivism, moral realists need also to respond to the\nerror theorist's contention that the arguments and disagreements all\nrest on some false supposition to the effect that there are actually\nfacts of the sort there would have to be for some of the claims to be\ntrue. And, however moral realists respond, they need to avoid doing so\nin a way that then makes a mystery of the widespread moral disagreement\n(or at least difference) that all acknowledge.\n\n\nSome moral realists argue that the disagreements, widespread as they\nare, do not go very deep\u2014that to a significant degree moral\ndisagreements play out against the background of shared fundamental\nprinciples with the differences of opinion regularly being traceable to\ndisagreements about the nonmoral facts that matter in light of the\nmoral principles. On their view, the explanation of moral disagreements\nwill be of a piece with whatever turns out to be a good explanation of\nthe various nonmoral disagreements people find themselves in.\n\n\nOther moral realists, though, see the disagreements as sometimes\nfundamental. On their view, while moral disagreements might in some\ncases be traceable to disagreements about nonmoral matters of fact,\nthis will not always be true. Still, they deny the anti-realist's\ncontention that the disagreements that remain are well explained by\nnoncognitivism or by an error theory. Instead, they regularly offer\nsome other explanation of the disagreements. They point out, for\nexample, that many of the disagreements can be traced to the\ndistorting effects of the emotions, attitudes, and interests that are\ninevitably bound up with moral issues. Or they argue that what appear\nto be disagreements are really cases in which the people are talking\npast each other, each making claims that might well be true once the\nclaims are properly understood (Harman 1975, Wong 1984). And they\noften combine these explanatory strategies holding that the full range\nof moral disagreements are well explained by some balanced appeal to\nall of the considerations just mentioned, treating some disagreements\nas not fundamentally moral, others as a reflection of the distorting\neffects of emotion and interest, and still others as being due to\ninsufficiently subtle understandings of what people are actually\nclaiming. If some combination of these explanations works, then the\nmoral realist is on firm ground in holding that the existence of moral\ndisagreements, such as they are, is not an argument against moral\nrealism. Of course, if no such explanation works, then an appeal\neither to noncognitivism or an error theory (i.e. to some form of\nanti-realism) may be the best alternative.\n2. Metaphysics\n\n\nPutting aside the arguments that appeal to moral disagreement, a\nsignificant motivation for anti-realism about morality is found in worries\nabout the metaphysics of moral realism and especially worries about whether\nmoral realism might be reconciled with (what has come to be called)\nnaturalism. It is hard, to say the least, to define naturalism in a\nclear way. Yet the underlying idea is fairly easy to convey. According\nto naturalism, the only facts we should believe in are those\ncountenanced by, or at least compatible with, the results of science.\nTo find, of some putative fact, that its existence is neither\nestablished by, nor even compatible with science, is to discover, as\nnaturalism would have it, that there is no such fact. If moral realism\nrequires facts that are incompatible with science (as many think it\ndoes) that alone would constitute a formidable argument against it.\n\n\nNoncognitivists and error theorists alike have no trouble respecting\nnaturalism while offering their respective accounts of moral claims. In\nboth cases, their accounts appeal to nothing not already embraced by\nnaturalism. Of course noncognitivists and error theories disagree in\ncrucial ways about the nature of moral thought, and noncognitivists and\nerror theorists disagree among themselves too about which versions of\ntheir preferred accounts are better. But they all are, from the point\nof view of naturalism, on safe ground.\n\n\nMoral realists, in contrast, are standardly seen as unable to\nsustain their accounts without appealing, in the end, to putative facts\nthat fly in the face of naturalism. This standard view can be traced to\na powerful and influential argument offered by G.E. Moore (1903). As\nMoore saw things, being a naturalist about morality required thinking\nthat moral terms could be defined correctly using terms that refer to\nnatural properties. Thus one might define \u2018good\u2019 as\n\u2018pleasant\u2019, thus securing naturalistic credentials for\nvalue (so long as pleasure was a natural property) or one might define\n\u2018good\u2019 as \u2018satisfies a desire we desire to\nhave\u2019 or as \u2018conforms to the rules in force in our\nsociety\u2019 or \u2018promotes the species.\u2019 Any one of these\nproposed definitions, if true, would establish that the facts required\nto make claims about what is good true or false were compatible with\nnaturalism. Yet, Moore argued, no such definition is true.\nAgainst every one, he maintain, a single line of argument was decisive.\nFor in each case, whatever naturalistic definition of moral terms was\non offer, it always made sense to ask, of things that had the\nnaturalistic property in question, whether those things were (really)\ngood.\n\n\nConsider someone who held not merely that pleasure was something good\nbut (as a definition would have it) that pleasure was\ngoodness\u2014that they were one and the same property. According to\nthat person, in claiming that something is pleasant one is claiming\nthat it is good, and vice versa. In that case, though, it\nwould not make sense for people to acknowledge that something is\npleasant and then wonder, nonetheless, whether it was good. That would\nbe like acknowledging that something is a triangle and then wondering,\nnonetheless, whether it has three sides. Yet, Moore maintained, the\ntwo cases are not alike. A person who wonders whether a triangle has\nthree sides shows he does not understand what it is to be a\ntriangle. His competence with the terms in question is revealed to be\ninadequate. In contrast, Moore observed, for any natural property\nwhatsoever it was always an open question whether things that had that\nnatural property were good.  A person who raised that question did not\nthereby reveal himself not to be competent with the terms in\nquestion. What this shows, Moore argued, was that moral terms did not\nrefer to natural properties and so a proper account of moral claims\nwould have to recognize that they purport to report non-natural\nfacts.\n\n\nNow of course moral realists can consistently acknowledge this and\nthen argue against naturalism\u2014perhaps, at least in part, on the\ngrounds that naturalism is incompatible with acknowledging moral facts. This\nwas, in fact, Moore\u2019s position. Yet one then has the burden of\nexplaining how moral facts are related to natural facts and the burden\nof explaining how we might manage to learn of these non-natural facts.\nA good deal of the work that has been done defending moral realism is\ndevoted either to meeting these burdens or to showing that they do not\npose a special problem just for morality. Moral realists of this sort\nallow that moral facts are not natural facts, and moral knowledge is\nnot simply of a piece with scientific knowledge, even as they defend\nthe idea that there are moral facts and (at least in principle) moral\nknowledge. They thus reject the idea that science is the measure and\ntest of all things (Shafer-Landau 2003, Parfit 2011, Scanlon 2014).\n\n\nImpressed by the plausibility of naturalism, though, many moral\nrealists have tried, in one way or another, to show that the moral\nfacts they are committed to are either themselves natural facts or are\nat least appropriately compatible with such facts (Boyd 1988, Brink\n1989, Railton 1986). If they are right, then naturalism poses no\nspecial threat to moral realism.\n \n\nFor a long time, people thought that Moore\u2019s Open Question\nArgument (as it has come to be called) established that no version of\nmoral naturalism was defensible. However, recent developments in the\nphilosophy of language and metaphysics have raised concerns about\nMoore\u2019s argument. Of special concern is the fact that the\nargument seems to rule out inappropriately the possibility of\nestablishing\u2014on grounds other than semantic analysis\u2014that\ntwo terms actually refer to the same property, substance, or\nentity.\n\n\nThe problem becomes clear if one thinks of, for instance, the claim\nthat water is H2O. That water is H2O cannot be\ndiscovered simply by appreciating the meanings of the terms involved,\nso if a person were to wonder of some water whether it is really\nH2O he would not thereby be revealing some incompetence\nwith the terms in question. His question would be, in the relevant\nway, an Open Question, even if, in fact, water is\nH2O. Similarly, some moral realists argue that value might,\nin fact, be properly identified with, say, what satisfies desires we\ndesire to have (to take one proposal Moore considered) even though\nthis cannot be discovered simply by appreciating the meanings of the\nterms involved. As a result, a person might intelligibly wonder\nwhether something that satisfied a desire she desired to have was\nactually good. The question might be, in the relevant way, an Open\nQuestion, even if, in fact, value is whatever satisfies a desire we\ndesire to have. Of course the point here is not that one or another\nsuch proposal is true, but that the openness of the Open Question is\nnot good grounds for supposing such proposals could not be true.\n\n\nPursing a different response to Moore's Open Question Argument, others\nhave defended the possibility of a successful semantic analysis\nreducing moral claims to claims expressible in entirely naturalistic\nterms (Jackson 1998, Finlay 2014). Accordingly, they argue that the\nopenness Moore points to, such as it is, is compatible with a correct\nsemantic analysis\u2014albeit not obvious\u2014showing that\nmoral facts are nothing over and above natural facts. \n\n\nOnce the Open Question is sidelined as being, at least, not\ndecisive, room is left for thinking a correct account of the moral\nfacts might identify them as natural facts. Just which facts those\nmight be, and what arguments one might offer for one account rather\nthan another, remains open, but the idea that we can know ahead of time\nthat there are no good arguments for such an account is no longer\nwidely accepted.\n3. Psychology\n\n\nNonetheless, realists and anti-realists alike are usually inclined\nto hold that Moore\u2019s Open Question Argument is getting at\nsomething important\u2014some feature of moral claims that makes\nthem not well captured by nonmoral claims.\n\n\nAccording to some, that \u2018something important\u2019 is that\nmoral claims are essentially bound up with motivation in a way that\nnonmoral claims are not (Ayer 1936, Stevenson 1937, Gibbard 1990,\nBlackburn 1993). Exactly what the connection to motivation is supposed\nto be is itself controversial, but one common proposal (motivation\ninternalism) is that a person counts as sincerely making a moral claim\nonly if she is motivated appropriately. To think of something that it\nis good, for instance, goes with being, other things equal, in favor of\nit in ways that would provide some motivation (not necessarily\ndecisive) to promote, produce, preserve or in other ways support it. If\nsomeone utterly lacks such motivations and yet claims nonetheless that\nshe thinks the thing in question is good, there is reason, people note,\nto suspect either that she is being disingenuous or that she does not\nunderstand what she is saying. This marks a real contrast with nonmoral\nclaims since the fact that a person makes some such claim sincerely\nseems never to entail anything in particular about her motivations.\nWhether she is attracted by, repelled by, or simply indifferent to some\ncolor is irrelevant to whether her claim that things have that color\nare sincere and well understood by her.\n\n\nNoncognitivists often appeal to this apparent contrast to argue that\nmoral claims have this necessary connection to motivation precisely\nbecause they do not express beliefs (that might be true or false) but\ninstead express motivational states of desire, approval, or commitment\n(that might be satisfied or frustrated but are neither true nor false).\nNonmoral claims, they maintain, commonly express beliefs and for that\nreason are rightly seen as purporting to report facts and as being\nevaluable as true or false. Yet, because beliefs alone are\nmotivationally inert, the fact that someone is sincerely making such a\nclaim (that is, is expressing something she actually believes) is\ncompatible with her having any sort of motivation, or none at all. In\ncontrast, claims that commonly express desires, preferences, and\ncommitments do not purport to report facts and are not evaluable as\ntrue or false. Yet, because these are all motivationally loaded, the\nfact that someone sincerely makes such a claim (that is, is expressing\nsomething she actually feels) is incompatible with her failing to have\nthe corresponding motivations. As soon as the contrast is in place,\nnoncognitivists argue, we can well explain the motivational force of\nsincere moral claims and explain too the insight behind Moore\u2019s\nOpen Question Argument, by seeing moral claims as not beliefs but\n(perhaps a distinctive kind of) desire, preference, or commitment.\n\n\nSome moral realists respond to this line of argument by rejecting\nthe idea that beliefs are all motivationally inert (Platts 1979).\nAccording to them moral beliefs stand as a counter example. But it is\nnot the only apparent counter example. Consider, for instance, first\nperson claims concerning the prospect of pain. If a person claimed that\nan experience would be painful and yet had no motivation whatsoever,\nother things equal, to resist, oppose, or in some way avoid that\nexperience, there would be reason to suspect either that she is being\ndisingenuous or that she does not understand what she is saying. That,\nthough, is no reason to think a sincere claim that some experience\nwould be painful does not express a belief, purport to report a fact,\nand open itself to evaluation as true or false. This all suggests,\nthese realists argue, that moral claims might well carry motivational\nimplications, and that might be the insight behind Moore\u2019s Open\nQuestion Argument, even though those claims express beliefs and, as a\nresult, purport to report facts and can be evaluated as true or\nfalse.\n\n\nOther moral realists reject the idea that moral claims are as\ntightly bound up with motivation as the noncognitivist argument\nsupposes. They point out that, while an absence of appropriate\nmotivation would raise questions, there might be answers. The person\nmaking the claims might be so depressed or so weak-willed or so evil,\nthat she remains utterly unmoved even when she sincerely thinks action\nwould secure something valuable. To suppose this is not possible is to\nbeg the question against those who would grant that beliefs are\nmotivationally inert while holding that moral claims express\nbeliefs.\n\n\nThose that take this line can, and often do, go on to argue\nnonetheless both (i) that there is a distinctive connection between\nmoral claims and action and (ii) that the connection helps to explain\nthe insight behind Moore\u2019s Open Question Argument. However, they\nmaintain, the distinctive connection is either itself a normative\nconnection between the claims and motivation or else it is a conceptual\nconnection between the claims (or their truth) and which actions a\nperson has reason to perform (Smith 1994). On the first suggestion, a\nperson might well fail to be motivated appropriately by the moral\nclaims she sincerely embraces, but in failing to be appropriately\nmotivated she would thereby count as irrational. On the second\nsuggestion, again a person might well fail to be motivated\nappropriately by the moral claims she sincerely embraces, but either\nthe fact that she sincerely embraces the claims or the truth of the\nclaims she embraces (if they are true) provide reasons for her to act\nin certain ways. All of these views involves rejecting motivational\ninternalism even as they each maintain that there is a conceptual\nconnection of some sort between moral claims (or their truth) and\naction (or the motivation to act). (The resulting views are often\ncharacterized as versions of reason internalism.) Nonmoral claims alone\nnever imply anything in particular about what people have reason to do\nor refrain from doing, but moral claims, in contrast, do have such\nimplications, they argue. On this view, there is a necessary connection\nbetween moral claims and action, but it is between these claims (or\ntheir truth) and reason (or rationality), and is not such that\nsincerely embracing a moral claim guarantees appropriate\nmotivation.\n\n\nNone of this is to defend, as realists must, the idea that some of\nthe claims are actually true. But it does suggest that moral realists\ncan acknowledge a necessary connection between moral claims and action\nwithout abandoning the cognitivism that is central to their\nposition.\n\n\nSome error theorists do argue that combining cognitivism with\nmotivational internalism results in an untenable position (Mackie\n1977). According to them, the moral facts that would make motivating\nbeliefs true would themselves have to be, in some way, intrinsically\nmotivating states of the world. And, they add, there is no reason to\nthink there are such states. Yet if the motivational internalism one\nembraces for moral claims has a parallel for pain claims, then this\nargument must be wrong (assuming it is true of some experiences that\nthey are painful). Either motivational internalism does not require\nintrinsically motivating states of the world in order for the relevant\nclaims to be true or else we have independent reason (provided by our\nawareness of pain) to think there are such states. While there may well\nbe reason to think there are no moral facts, this argument does not\nprovide it.\n4. Epistemology\n\n\nSuppose, for the sake of the argument, that there are moral facts.\nSuppose even that the moral facts are properly thought of as at least\ncompatible with science. One thing Moore\u2019s Open Question\nArgument still seems to show is that no appeal to natural facts\ndiscovered by scientific method would establish that the moral facts\nare one way rather than another. That something is pleasant, or\nuseful, or satisfies someone\u2019s preference, is perfectly\ncompatible with thinking that it is neither good nor right nor worth\ndoing. The mere fact that moral facts might be compatible with natural\nfacts does nothing to support the idea that we could learn about the\nmoral facts.  David Hume seems to have been, in effect, pressing this\npoint long before Moore, when he argued that no moral conclusion\nfollows non-problematically from nonmoral premises (Hume 1739). No\n\u201cought,\u201d he pointed out, followed from an\n\u201cis\u201d\u2014without the help of another (presupposed)\n\u201cought.\u201d More generally, there is no valid inference from\nnonmoral premises to moral conclusions unless one relies, at least\nsurreptitiously, on a moral premise. If, then, all that science can\nestablish is what \u201cis\u201d and not what ought to be, science\ncannot alone establish moral conclusions.\n\n\nBut from where, then, can we get the moral premises needed? Of\ncourse no answer is to be found in a claim that certain norms are in\nforce or that a powerful being commanded something since, in both\ncases, nothing about what ought to be done follows from these claims\nwithout assuming some further moral claim (e.g. that one ought to obey\nthe norms in force or that one owes allegiance to the powerful being).\nIf at least some fundamental moral principles were self-evident, or\nanalytic truths, or at least reasonably thought to enjoy widespread\nconsensus or to be such that eventually all would converge on those\nprinciples, there might be some plausible candidates. Yet the few\nprinciples that might be candidates\u2014one ought to treat people with\nrespect or one ought to promote human welfare or, other things equal,\npleasure is good\u2014are all either so abstract or inspecific in\ntheir implications that they could hardly alone work to justify the\nfull range of moral claims people are inclined to make.\n\n\nThese considerations highlight a crucial difficulty moral realists\nface even if one grants the existence of moral facts: they need some\naccount of how we might justify our moral claims. Otherwise, whatever\nthe moral facts are, we would have reasonable grounds for worrying that\nwhat we count as evidence for any particular claim is no evidence at\nall.\n\n\nIn light of this concern, it is worth noting that the challenge\nposed here for our moral claims actually plagues a huge range of other\nclaims we take ourselves to be justified in making. For instance, just\nas no collection of nonmoral premises will alone entail a moral\nconclusion, no collection of nonpsychological premises will alone\nentail a psychological conclusion, and no collection of nonbiological\npremises will alone entail a biological conclusion. In each case the\npremises will entail the conclusions only if, at least surreptitiously,\npsychological or biological premises, respectively, are introduced. Yet\nno one supposes that this means we can never justify claims concerning\npsychology or biology. That there are these analogues of course does\nnot establish that we are, in fact, justified in making the moral\nclaims we do. But they do show that granting the inferential gap\nbetween nonmoral claims and moral claims does not establish that we can\nhave no evidence for the moral claims. And they refocus the challenge\nfacing moral realists. Under what conditions, and why, are\npsychological and biological claims reasonably thought justified? Might\nsimilar conditions and considerations hold for moral claims?\n\n\nAt one time, philosophers thought there was a quick and easy answer to\nthese questions, an answer that immediately discredited moral\nclaims. That answer was that in psychology and biology our\njustifications can and do ultimately ground out in empirical\nobservations, whereas nothing of the kind is available for moral\ntheory. If true, this would explain in a sharp way why psychology and\nbiology might have a real claim on our opinions while morality and\nalchemy and various crackpot theories do not. The former can be tested\nagainst experience and pass the test, while the latter, while\ntestable, can be seen to fail utterly.\n\n\nMoral realists have three sorts of reply to the epistemic challenge\nthey face. One is to argue that a proper appreciation of the ways in\nwhich all observation is theory laden leaves no real contrast between\nthe observations that support psychology and biology and those that are\nappealed to supporting moral theories. As proponents of this view would\nhave it, the process of justifying various scientific theories, which\ninvolves moving back and forth between particular specific claims and\nmore general principles seeking a mutually supporting system, is\nmatched step for step by when people develop and defend moral theories.\nIn both cases specific judgments (concerning observations or the\nbadness of a certain act, for instance) are tentatively accepted and an\nattempt is made to make sense of them by appeal to more general\nprinciples that explain the judgments. When the more general principles\nare available the specific judgments are taken as evidence for the\nprinciples and the principles reciprocate by helping to justify the\nthought that the specific judgments are accurate. But if no general\nprinciples are available the specific judgments are called into\nquestion and the suspicion is rightly raised that they might be\nillusory or misleading. Whether they are taken to be warranted is\ndecided in large part, and rightly, by appealing to other principles\nthat so far have themselves found support in their fit with still other\nspecific judgments. The process is of necessity tentative and piecemeal\nbut it is, many argue, nonetheless no different in science than in\nmorality. All of this is, of course, compatible with thinking the\nprocess might end in failure\u2014alchemy and crackpot theories are\nprime examples of how the attempt to sustain a systematic and mutually\nsupporting set of beliefs can fail. But absent special arguments that\nmorality fails in the way they do, morality no less than psychology and\nbiology can claim that experience may well provide confirmation for our\nmoral claims (Sayre-McCord 1996).\n\n\nSome moral realists, particularists, reject the general picture of\nsystematic justification just described and yet argue that, when it\ncomes to the role of observation, moral claims are nonetheless actually\non a par with non-moral claims (Dancy 1993). According to them, our\njustification for our particular nonmoral observations depends not at\nall on our having any sort of articulatable general grounds to offer\nas support. To suppose otherwise is to succumb to a misguided picture\nof when and why people are justified in believing as they do\nconcerning what they observe. The situation is exactly the same,\nparticularists maintain, with our moral claims. Here too someone can\nbe perfectly justified in claiming, for instance, that some particular\naction was wrong or that some response was obligatory, without having\narticulatable general ground to offer as support. Such moral claims\nmight, of course, still prove to be mistaken, but then the same is\ntrue of what people take themselves to have seen.\n\n\nAnother realist reply to the epistemic challenge is to argue that\nmathematics and logic, not science, are the right models of moral\ntheory (Scanlon 2014). Neither mathematics nor logic, some maintain, rely on\nexperience for their confirmation. They are, instead, supportable a\npriori by appeal to the nature of the concepts they involve. On\nthis view, a sound defense of the principles we need to ground moral\narguments can be found in a suitably subtle and careful bit of\nconceptual analysis. In light of Moore\u2019s Open Question Argument,\nthose who advocate an epistemology of conceptual analysis acknowledge\nthat the correct analysis, whatever it is, is likely not at all\nobvious. And, they point out, this means that people who are genuinely\ncompetent with the relevant concepts might themselves not recognize the\ncorrect analysis as correct (Jackson 1998). Nonetheless, the analysis might be\ncorrect. If there is some such analysis to be had, and if it is rich\nenough to provide the sort of substantive principles needed to\nunderwrite our various particular judgments, realism will have met well\nits epistemic burden. Of course putting things this way assumes we have\na good epistemology of conceptual analysis, which might well be called\ninto question. But worries about conceptual analysis are not specific\nto morality. And if they prove decisive, then those worries leave\nmathematics and logic, no less than morals, in need of some grounding\nor other. Whatever might be advanced on behalf of mathematics and\nlogic, many think, should work as well for morality.\n\n\nStill another reply, compatible with the first two but relying\nspecifically on neither, shifts attention from science and from\nmathematics and logic, to epistemology itself. To think of any set of\nconsiderations that they justify some conclusion is to make a claim\nconcerning the value (albeit the epistemic as opposed to moral value)\nof a conclusion. To hold of science, or mathematics, or logic, that\nthere is a difference between good evidence or good arguments and bad\nones is again to commit oneself evaluatively. This raises an obvious\nquestion: under what conditions, and why, are epistemic claims\nreasonably thought justified? Whatever answer one might begin to offer\nwill immediately provide a model for an answer to the parallel question\nraised about moral judgments. There is no guarantee, of course, that\nour moral judgments will then end up being justified. The epistemic\nstandards epistemology meets might well not be met by moral theory. But\nthere is good reason to think the kinds of consideration that are\nappropriate to judging epistemic principles will be appropriate too\nwhen it comes to judging other normative principles, including those\nthat we might recognize as moral. This means that any quick dismissal\nof moral theory as obviously not the sort of thing that could really be\njustified are almost surely too quick.\n5. Semantics\n\n\nMoral realists have here been characterized as those who hold that\nmoral claims purport to report facts, that they are evaluable as true\nor false in light of whether the facts are as the claims purport, and\nthat at least some such claims are actually true. Many have thought\nthere are good reasons\u2014even decisive reasons\u2014for\nrejecting moral realism so conceived.\n\n\nYet, with the development of (what has come to be called) minimalism\nabout talk of truth and fact, it might seem that this characterization\nmakes being a moral realist easier than it should be. As minimalism\nwould have it, saying that some claim is true is just a way of\n(re-)asserting the claim and carries no commitment beyond that\nexpressed by the original claim. Thus, if one is willing to claim that\n\u201cmurdering innocent children for fun is wrong\u201d one can\ncomfortably claim as well that that \u201cmurdering innocent children\nfor fun is wrong is true\u201d without thereby taking on any\nadditional metaphysical baggage. Since even noncognitivists would\npresumably be willing to claim that \u201cmurdering innocent children\nfor fun is wrong,\u201d they can acknowledge that the claim is true\ntoo and it would be a mistake to see that addition as any sort of\nrenunciation of their noncognitivism. Having said that \u201cit is\ntrue that murdering innocent children for fun is wrong,\u201d it\nseems similarly innocuous for the non-cognitivists to grant that it is\na fact. After all, they can argue, to say of some claim that what it\nsays is a fact is itself just a way of (re-)asserting the claim and it\ntoo carries no commitment beyond that expressed by the original\nclaim. Grammar alone, it seems, renders talk of truth and fact\nappropriate and does so without incurring the sort of metaphysical\ncommitments that are rightly associated with genuine realism (see\nGibbard 2003, Dreier 2005).\n\n\nPutting things this way, though, is misleading. It involves supposing\nthat the noncognitivist has somehow made out what her position comes\nto without appealing to a contrast between, on the one hand, those\nclaims that are properly seen as truth-evaluable and, on the other\nhand, those that are not.  Traditional noncognitivism embraces this\ncontrast and so traditional noncognitivists are able to argue\nintelligibly that moral claims are among those for which truth is\ngenuinely not at issue. They often, against the background of the\ncontrast, go on to explain why moral claims nonetheless mimic so well\nclaims that might actually be true and why we might even talk of them\nbeing \u201ctrue\u201d in a sense (albeit not in the sense in which\nclaims properly understood as cognitive might be true). If, though,\nthe contrast cannot be drawn in terms of whether the claims are\ntruth-evaluable, the noncognitivist needs to offer an alternative\naccount of what marks the difference between the claims concerning\nwhich one should be a noncognitivist and those concerning which one\nshould be a cognitivist. Absent such a contrast, the noncognitivists\nhave no distinctive thesis.\n\n\nError theorists also can find no special comfort in minimalism about\ntruth and fact. After all, to defend their view, error theorists need\nto advance grounds for thinking that, while moral claims are\ntruth-evaluable, none of them are actually true. This requires\nresisting the minimalist urge to make truth so cheap that any sort of\nclaim can have it. That is not to say that an error theorist cannot be\na minimalist about truth and fact. But it is to say that the\nminimalism does not make her position easier (and it may actually make\nher position more difficult) to sustain.\n\n\nMinimalism is, then, no panacea for moral anti-realists.  But it is\nnot poison for them either.  Although minimalism undermines the\nstandard way in which anti-realists mark out their distinctive\nterritory, there is still room for them to defend some alternative\ngrounds for drawing the contrast between the areas about which one is\na realist and those about which one is an anti-realist. For instance,\none might argue that to be a realist about some area (morality or\nwhatever) is to hold that the properties distinctive to that area (in\nthis case moral properties) figure in some fundamental way in our\nexplanations. To be an anti-realist, on this view, is to hold that\nsuch properties do not so figure.  Drawing the contrast in this way\nwould allow an anti-realist still to acknowledge that the properties\nexist (albeit not as fundamental explainers) and that claims ascribing\nthem are sometimes true.  But it is unclear whether the main issues\nthat divide those who consider themselves realists from their\nopponents are best seen as being about whether moral properties\nqualify as fundamental explainers.  Alternatively, one might argue\nthat to be a realist about some area is to hold that the truths\nexpressed by the relevant claims are not mind-dependent. And, the\nsuggestion would be, to be an anti-realist is to think that if there\nare such truths, they are mind-dependent.  This way of drawing the\ncontrast risks ruling out as impossible realism about psychology,\nwhich seems draconian.  And it would immediately count as anti-realist\nthose metaethical views that treat moral facts as response dependent\nor in other ways dependent upon human thought and practice.  So,\nagain, it is unclear whether this contrast lines up properly with the\nmain issues that have divided realists from\nanti-realists. Nonetheless, one might rely on either explanation or\nmind-independence to mark an important contrast between various\nmetaethical views. Paying attention to the stand particular views take\non explanation and mind-independence inevitably helps to keep them in\nfocus and works to mark important questions. \n\n\nWhatever one thinks of minimalism, of the importance of explanation, and\nof mind-independence, moral realism travels with the burden of making\nsense of the semantics of moral terms in a way that will support\nseeing claims that use them as genuinely truth-evaluable. Various\nfeatures of the way in which people rely on such claims in their\nthought and talk support the idea that they are. At the same time,\nthough, some aspects of the ways in which children acquire moral terms\nand the ways in which those terms are bound up with various emotions\npull against seeing the terms as simply on a par with nonmoral\nterms. Working through the ways in which moral claims differ from, as\nwell as the ways in which they are the same as, other claims that\npeople make is essential to getting a full understanding of our moral\nthought and practice. Whether such a full understanding will involve\nseeing us as having moral beliefs (and not just moral reactions) that\nmight be true, is not at all clear. Perhaps even less clear is whether\nand why we might reasonably hold that some of those beliefs are\nactually true. Yet it is pretty clear that people do generally regard\ntheir moral claims, and the moral claims of others, as purporting to\nreport facts, and to the extent they themselves sincerely advance such\nclaims they seem to be regarding at least some such claims as actually\ntrue. The burden is on the anti-realists about morality to argue that\nthat this involves a mistake of some sort.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ayer, A.
