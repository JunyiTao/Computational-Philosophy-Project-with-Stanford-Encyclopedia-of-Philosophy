    "main_text": "The Concept of Taste || Immediacy\n1.1 Immediacy\n\nRationalism about beauty is the view that judgments of beauty are\njudgments of reason, i.e., that we judge things to be beautiful by\nreasoning it out, where reasoning it out typically involves inferring\nfrom principles or applying concepts. At the beginning of the 18th\ncentury, rationalism about beauty had achieved dominance on the\ncontinent, and was being pushed to new extremes by \u201cles\ng\u00e9om\u00e8tres,\u201d a group of literary theorists who\naimed to bring to literary criticism the mathematical rigor that\nDescartes had brought to physics. As one such theorist put it:\n\nThe way to think about a literary problem is that pointed out by\nDescartes for problems of physical science. A critic who tries any\nother way is not worthy to be living in the present century. There is\nnothing better than mathematics as propaedeutic for literary\ncriticism. (Terrasson 1715, Preface, 65; quoted in Wimsatt and Brooks\n1957, 258)\n\n\nIt was against this, and against more moderate forms of rationalism\nabout beauty, that mainly British philosophers working mainly within\nan empiricist framework began to develop theories of taste. The\nfundamental idea behind any such theory\u2014which we may call\nthe immediacy thesis\u2014is that judgments of beauty are\nnot (or at least not canonically) mediated by inferences from\nprinciples or applications of concepts, but rather have all the\nimmediacy of straightforwardly sensory judgments. It is the idea, in\nother words, that we do not reason to the conclusion that things are\nbeautiful, but rather \u201csense\u201d that they are. Here is an\nearly expression of the thesis, from Jean-Baptiste Dubos\u2019s\nCritical Reflections on Poetry, Painting, and Music, which\nfirst appeared in 1719:\n\nDo we ever reason, in order to know whether a ragoo be good or bad;\nand has it ever entered into any body\u2019s head, after having\nsettled the geometrical principles of taste, and defined the qualities\nof each ingredient that enters into the composition of those messes,\nto examine into the proportion observed in their mixture, in order to\ndecide whether it be good or bad? No, this is never practiced. We have\na sense given us by nature to distinguish whether the cook acted\naccording to the rules of his art. People taste the ragoo, and\ntho\u2019 unacquainted with those rules, they are able to tell\nwhether it be good or no. The same may be said in some respect of the\nproductions of the mind, and of pictures made to please and move us.\n(Dubos 1748, vol. II, 238\u2013239)\n\n\nAnd here is a late expression, from Kant\u2019s 1790 Critique of\nthe Power of Judgment:\n\nIf someone reads me his poem or takes me to a play that in the end\nfails to please my taste, then he can adduce Batteux or Lessing, or\neven older and more famous critics of taste, and adduce all the rules\nthey established as proofs that his poem is beautiful\u2026 . I will\nstop my ears, listen to no reasons and arguments, and would rather\nbelieve that those rules of the critics are false \u2026 than allow\nthat my judgment should be determined by means of a priori\ngrounds of proof, since it is supposed to be a judgment of taste and\nnot of the understanding of reason. (Kant 1790, 165)\n\n\nBut the theory of taste would not have enjoyed its eighteenth-century\nrun, nor would it continue now to exert its influence, had it been\nwithout resources to counter an obvious rationalist objection. There\nis a wide difference\u2014so goes the objection\u2014between judging\nthe excellence of a ragout and judging the excellence of a poem or a\nplay. More often than not, poems and plays are objects of great\ncomplication. But taking in all that complication requires a lot of\ncognitive work, including the application of concepts and the drawing\nof inferences. Judging the beauty of poems and plays, then, is\nevidently not immediate and so evidently not a matter of taste.\n\nThe chief way of meeting this objection was first to distinguish\nbetween the act of grasping the object preparatory to judging it and\nthe act of judging the object once grasped, and then to allow the\nformer, but not the latter, to be as concept- and inference-mediated\nas any rationalist might wish. Here is Hume, with characteristic\nclarity:\n\n[I]n order to pave the way for [a judgment of taste], and give a\nproper discernment of its object, it is often necessary, we find, that\nmuch reasoning should precede, that nice distinctions be made, just\nconclusions drawn, distant comparisons formed, complicated relations\nexamined, and general facts fixed and ascertained. Some species of\nbeauty, especially the natural kinds, on their first appearance\ncommand our affection and approbation; and where they fail of this\neffect, it is impossible for any reasoning to redress their influence,\nor adapt them better to our taste and sentiment. But in many orders of\nbeauty, particularly those of the fine arts, it is requisite to employ\nmuch reasoning, in order to feel the proper sentiment. (Hume, 1751,\nSection I)\n\n\nHume\u2014like Shaftesbury and Hutcheson before him, and Reid after\nhim (Cooper 1711, 17, 231; Hutcheson 1725, 16\u201324; Reid 1785,\n760\u2013761)\u2014regarded the faculty of taste as a kind of\n\u201cinternal sense.\u201d Unlike the five \u201cexternal\u201d\nor \u201cdirect\u201d senses, an \u201cinternal\u201d (or\n\u201creflex\u201d or \u201csecondary\u201d) sense is one that\ndepends for its objects on the antecedent operation of some other\nmental faculty or faculties. Reid characterizes internal sense as\nfollows:\n\nBeauty or deformity in an object, results from its nature or\nstructure. To perceive the beauty therefore, we must perceive the\nnature or structure from which it results. In this the internal sense\ndiffers from the external. Our external senses may discover qualities\nwhich do not depend upon any antecedent perception\u2026 . But it is\nimpossible to perceive the beauty of an object, without perceiving the\nobject, or at least conceiving it. (Reid 1785, 760\u2013761)\n\n\nBecause of the highly complex natures or structures of many beautiful\nobjects, there will have to be a role for reason in their perception.\nBut perceiving the nature or structure of an object is one thing.\nPerceiving its beauty is another.\n",
