The idea that\nempathy produces altruistic motivation may seem improbable given the\ndominance of Western thought by the doctrine of universal egoism. Yet,\nin the words of Sherlock Holmes, \u201cWhen you have eliminated the\nimpossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the\ntruth\u201d. It seems impossible for any known egoistic explanation\nof the empathy-helping relationship\u2014or any combination of\nthem\u2014to account for the research evidence we have reviewed. So\nwhat remains? The empathy-altruism hypothesis. Pending new evidence or\na plausible new egoistic explanation of the existing evidence, we seem\nforced to accept this improbable hypothesis as true. (Batson 2011:\n 160)[21]\n\n\n\nBatson\u2019s research program is compelling, and he certainly has\nshown that the empathy-altruism hypothesis is \u201cin the\nhunt\u201d, but his findings are not conclusive.  There are a number\nof reasonable challenges to the methodology and the conclusions in some\nof Batson\u2019s studies.  Setting these out in detail is a\nsubstantial project (see Stich, Doris, & Roedder 2010). But there\nis also a plausible egoistic hypothesis that has not been\nsystematically explored. \n\nIn recent years, a number of authors have made an impressive case for\nthe hypothesis that belief in a \u201cBig God\u201d\u2014a\nsupernatural being who is omniscient, morally concerned, and acts as a\npolicing agent in human affairs\u2014played a crucial role in the\ntransition from face-to-face \u201cband level\u201d human groups\nmade up of at most a few hundred individuals to much larger tribal\ngroups, and ultimately to chiefdoms and nation states (Norenzayan et\nal. 2016). These are provocative and controversial ideas. Much less\ncontroversial is the claim that many people believe that even when no\nother human can observe them, a supernatural being of some sort is\naware of what they are doing and thinking, and that this being may\npunish thoughts and behavior it disapproves of and reward thoughts and\nbehavior it approves of, with the punishments and rewards delivered\neither during the agent\u2019s lifetime or after she\n dies.[22]\n In the experiments, described in\n section 5.1,\n designed to test the empathy-altruism hypothesis against the social\npunishment hypothesis, Batson and his colleagues went to great lengths\nto insure that participants in the \u201clow potential for negative\nsocial evaluation\u201d condition would think that no one knew of\ntheir decisions, and thus that no one would think badly of them or\nsanction them if they decided not to help. But, of course, none of the\nsteps taken to insure secrecy would be effective in keeping an\nomniscient God from knowing what these participants had decided. So if\nwe assume that many people believe an omniscient God wants them to\nhelp others in need, and that they believe Divine sanctions for not\nhelping are more likely when the target engenders\n empathy,[23]\n the experiments do nothing to rule out a variation of the social\npunishment hypothesis which maintains that participants are motivated\nby a desire to avoid punishments administered by God.\n\nThe egoistic alternative just sketched, which might be called\n\u201cthe divine punishment hypothesis\u201d, also leads to\nthe pattern of predictions derived from the empathy-altruism\n hypothesis sketched in\n Table 5,\n and the results reported in\n Table 6.\nThe bottom line is that using the Sherlock Holmes standard that Batson\nfavors, there is still a lot of work to do. There is a family of\negoistic hypotheses invoking beliefs in supernatural\npunishments\u2014or supernatural rewards\u2014that still needs to be\nruled out before we accept the \u201cimprobable hypothesis\u201d as\ntrue.[24]\n\n",
