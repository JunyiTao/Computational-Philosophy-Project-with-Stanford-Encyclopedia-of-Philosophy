    "main_text": "Second Kind of Position in Feminist Environmental Philosophy: Ecofeminist Philosophy || Historical Perspectives\n3.4 Historical Perspectives\nHistorical perspectives on the causes of the unjustified\ndominations of women and nature are conflicting and inconclusive. One\nof the earliest and most widely referenced is ecofeminist historian\nCarolyn Merchant's perspective (Merchant 1980). Merchant argues that\nthe separation of culture from nature (or, the culture/nature dualism)\nis a product of the scientific revolution. She describes two\nconflicting images of nature: an older, Greek image of nature as\norganic, benevolent, nurturing female, and a newer,\n\u201cmodern\u201d (1500\u20131800s) image of nature as inert, dead, and\nmechanistic. Merchant argues that the historical shift from an organic\nto a mechanistic model helped to justify the exploitation of the earth\nby conceiving of it as inert matter. For example, mining was\nprohibited in antiquity because it was thought to be \u201cmining the\nearth's womb\u201d; early Greek metaphors of nature as alive and\n\u201cnurturing female\u201d supported the view that mining was\nwrong. According to Merchant, a conception of nature as inert matter\nremoved moral barriers to mining that were in place when nature was\nconceived as organic, nurturing female. For many ecofeminist philosophers,\nMerchant's historical perspective informs their analyses of the deep\nconceptual roots of the unjustified dominations of women and nature.\n\n\n",
