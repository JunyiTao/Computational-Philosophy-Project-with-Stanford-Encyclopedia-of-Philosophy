    "main_text": "Ethics || Authentic Being-for-Others\n6.1 Authentic Being-for-Others\n\n\nSartre and Beauvoir argue that we generally exist as \u201ca\nbeing-for-others\u201d (un \u00eatre-pour-autrui), which is\nto say that I understand or see myself in the way that I do through\n\u201cthe look\u201d (le regard) of the Other. And the look\nhas the power to strip away my freedom and turn me into an object.\nHuman relations, on this account, are best understood as a form of\nconflict, a dyadic power struggle where I try to assert my freedom and\nsubjectivity by turning the Other into an object, while the Other tries\nto do the same to me. \u201cWhile I attempt to free myself from the\nhold of the Other,\u201d writes Sartre, \u201cthe Other is trying to\nfree himself from mine; while I seek to enslave the Other, the Other\nseeks to enslave me\u2026 Conflict is the original meaning of\nbeing-for-others\u201d (1943 [1956, 475]). This struggle for\nself-assertion leads to Sartre\u2019s famous claim in his play\nHuis Clos (No Exit) that \u201cHell is\u2014other\npeople\u201d (1944 [1989, 45]).\n\n\nBut the struggle to objectify and possess the Other by stripping\nthem of their freedom is a manifestation of inauthentic\nbeing-for-others. There is an authentic counterpart. Beauvoir, for\nexample, explores what it means to develop and cultivate freedom for\nothers with her account of \u201cauthentic love\u201d\n(l\u2019amour authentique), describing it as a relationship\nwhere we acknowledge and nurture the other\u2019s freedom and\ntranscendence while at the same time resisting the temptations of bad\nfaith, that is, to see the Other as an object or thing to be manipulated\nand possessed. As a moral stance, authentic being-for-others is a form\nof reciprocity that involves \u201cthe mutual recognition of two\nfreedoms [\u2026] [where] neither would give up transcendence [and]\nneither would be mutilated\u201d (1949 [1952, 667]). In this way\nauthenticity and morality belong together, whereby we have a shared\nobligation to liberate or free each other so that we can create\nourselves and take responsibility for the life we lead. Therefore, as\nBeauvoir puts it, \u201cto will oneself moral and to will oneself free\nare one and the same decision\u201d (1947 [1948, 24]).\n \n\n\nHeidegger develops a similar idea in Being and Time with\nhis account of \u201cliberating concern\u201d (befreiend\nF\u00fcrsorge), a form of care where the central aim is to free\nthe Other from patterns of self-deception so that they can anxiously\nface and create their own existence. It is a relational stance that\n\u201chelps the Other become transparent to himself in his care and to\nbecome free for it\u201d (1927 [1962, 122]). When we care in\nthis way, we resist the temptation to \u201cleap-in\u201d\n(einspringen) for the Other, as if the Other were a dependent\nthing or object that needs to be sheltered from the unsettling question\nof existence. Heidegger refers to this sheltering tendency in terms of\na kind of tacit mastery or \u201cdomination\u201d\n(Beherrschung) that strips the Other of the anxious\nresponsibility they have for their own life. Instead of\nleaping-in for the Other and disburdening them of their responsibility,\nan authentic relation is one that \u201cleaps-ahead\u201d\n(vorausspringt) of the Other, giving them back their anxiety\nand the freedom to care for and confront their condition. As Heidegger\nwrites, we leap-ahead of the Other, \u201cnot in order to take away\nhis \u2018care\u2019 but rather to give it back to them authentically\nas such for the first time\u201d (1927 [1962, 122]). Here, we see the\ndevelopment of an ethical maxim: to act in such a way as to will the\nrealization of your own freedom and the realization of freedom for\nothers.\n",
