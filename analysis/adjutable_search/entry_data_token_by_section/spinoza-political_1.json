    "main_text": "Historical Background || Theological and Political Background\n1.1 Theological and Political Background\n\n\nDespite being perhaps the most tolerant country in early-modern\nEurope\u2014a sanctuary for free thinkers and members of religious\nminorities\u2014the United Provinces were riven by religious conflict,\nas the Dutch sought to establish their identity after gaining\nindependence from Spain. The confessional rifts of the seventeenth\ncentury were certainly an important part of context in which Spinoza\ncomposed his Tractatus Theologico-Politicus [hereafter:\nTTP].\n\n\nThe early part of the seventeenth century was marked by a religious\nschism that rapidly took on political significance. In 1610,\nforty-four followers of liberal theologian Jacobus\nArminius\u2014referred to as Arminians\u2014wrote a formal\n\u201cRemonstrance,\u201d which articulated the ways in which they\ndeviated from orthodox Calvinism, particularly with respect to\nthe issues of self-determination and grace. The Arminians, or\nRemonstrants, defended religious toleration on the grounds that faith\nis expressed in the conscience of the individual, and so is not subject to the\ncoercive power of the state. The doctrinal and political views of the\nRemonstrants were opposed by the conservative Gomarists (followers of\nFranciscus Gomarus), or Counter-Remonstrants. For a little over a\ndecade (roughly 1607\u20131618), the dispute raged on, expanding outward\nfrom Holland and Utrecht.  Finally, in 1618, a national synod convened\n(the Synod of Dort) to define the public faith more clearly. The\nfallout from the Synod of Dort was disastrous for the tolerant\nArminians. The Advocate of the States of Holland, Johan\nOldenbarnevelt, who staunchly defended the Remonstrants, was put to\ndeath. And Arminians throughout the country were purged from town\ncouncils and universities (Israel 1995, 452ff).\n\n\nThe second half of the century witnessed its own major\ntheologico-political dispute in the United Provinces. At the center,\nonce again, were two theologians: Johannes Cocceius, a liberal theology\nprofessor at Leiden, and Gisbertus Voetius, Dean of the University of\nUtrecht. Disputes between Cocceian and Voetians began over abstruse\ntheological matters, but developed into a larger political and cultural\naffair. The Voetians led the assault on the Cartesian philosophy being\ntaught in the universities. They thought that the new science advocated\nby Descartes, with its mechanistic view of the material world, posed a\nthreat to Christianity in a variety of ways (Nadler 1999, 151\u20132 and\n308\u2013310). Spinoza\u2019s philosophy was reviled not only by the\nVoetians, but also by moderate Cocceian-Cartesians, who sought to\ndistance themselves from radicals.\n\n\nSpinoza was no stranger to religious persecution. As is well known,\nhe was himself excommunicated from the Jewish community in Amsterdam in\n1656. While Spinoza apparently endured the excommunication with\ncharacteristic equanimity, fellow Dutch apostate Jew, Uriel da Costa,\nwas unable to bear the indignity of excommunication from the Amsterdam\nJewish community. In 1640\u2014when Spinoza was only eight years\nold\u2014da Costa, who had denied the immortality of the soul and\nchallenged the status of the Torah as divine revelation, took his own\nlife.\n\n\nDa Costa\u2019s suicide surely made a lasting impression on\nSpinoza, but it did not affect him as personally as did the treatment\nof his friend Adriaan Koerbagh at the hands of Dutch authorities in the\nyears leading up to the publication of the TTP. In 1668 Koerbagh\npublished two treatises that provoked the wrath of the Calvinist\nclergy. In the more scandalous of the two\u2014Een Bloemhof van\nallerley lieflijkheyd (A Flower Garden of all Kinds of\nLoveliness)\u2014Koerbagh ridiculed a number of traditional religious\ndoctrines and practices, and, in the process, articulated his own\nreligious and metaphysical views. Among the shocking views that he\nadvanced were that Jesus is not divine, that God is identical with\nnature, that everything is necessitated by the laws of nature (the laws\nof God), and that miracles are impossible. These are all positions that\nSpinoza consistently endorsed. However, while Spinoza was famously\ncautious, Koerbagh was not, publishing the works in Dutch (thereby\nmaking them accessible to the general literate public) under his own\nname. Consequently, Koerbagh was tried and sentenced on charges of\nblasphemy. During his subsequent imprisonment under squalid conditions\nKoerbagh became ill. He died soon thereafter (in 1669). It is\ngenerally supposed that it was Koerbagh\u2019s imprisonment and death\nabove all else that precipitated the publication of the TTP (Nadler\n1999, 170).\n\n\nLiberal republicans were dealt a major blow in\n1672. In this so-called disaster year (rampjaar), French\ntroops, under the command of Louis XIV, invaded the United Provinces,\ncapturing a number of Dutch cities (Nadler 1999, 305). Grand\nPensionary (chief statesman and legal advisor) Johan de Witt\nshouldered much of the blame for this military embarrassment. De Witt\nwas the leader of the States of Holland for much of the republican\nperiod that followed the death of Stadholder (a quasi-monarchical\nposition held by the House of Orange) William II in 1650. After the\nFrench invasion, the stadholdership was reinstituted in the person of\nWilliam III, and De Witt was forced to resign. Shortly afterward he\nand his brother, Cornelis, were brutally killed by a zealous mob. This incident\nevoked uncommon anger in Spinoza, who was an admirer of de Witt and\nthe republican ideals for which he stood. According to one famous\naccount, Spinoza had to be restrained by his landlord from taking a\nsign reading ultimi barbarorum [\u201cultimate of\nbarbarians\u201d] to the site of the massacre (Freudenthal 1899,\n201). Spinoza\u2019s Tractatus Politicus was composed in the\naftermath of, and perhaps prompted by, the events of 1672.\n",
