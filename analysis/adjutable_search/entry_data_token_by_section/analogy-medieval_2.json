In\nscriptural exegesis, according to Aquinas, analogy was the method of\nshowing that one part of scripture did not conflict with another. In\nrhetoric and grammar, analogy was the method of settling a doubt about\na word\u2019s form by appeal to a similar and more certain case.\nSeveral twelfth-century theologians use the word in this sense. In\ntranslations of Pseudo-Dionysius, the term had a strictly ontological\nsense, for it refers to a being\u2019s capacity for participation in\ndivine perfections as this relates to lower or higher beings. In\nlogic, authors were aware that the Greek word\n\u2018\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u2019,\nsometimes called \u2018analogia\u2019 in Latin, but often\ntranslated as \u2018proportio\u2019 or\n\u2018proportionalitas\u2019, referred to the comparison\nbetween two proportions. However, by the 1220s the word came to be\nlinked with the phrase \u201cin a prior and a posterior sense\u201d\nand by the 1250s terms said according to a comparison of proportions\nwere normally separated from terms said according to a prior and a\nposterior sense.\n\nThe phrase \u201cin a prior and a posterior sense\u201d seems to\nhave been derived from Arabic philosophy. H.A. Wolfson has presented\nevidence for Aristotle\u2019s recognition of a type of term\nintermediate between equivocal and univocal terms, some instances of\nwhich were characterized by their use according to priority and\nposteriority. He showed that Alexander of Aphrodisias called this type\nof term \u2018ambiguous\u2019 and that the Arabic philosophers,\nstarting with Alfarabi, made being said in a prior and a posterior\nsense the main characteristic of all ambiguous terms. So far as the\nmedieval Latin west is concerned, the main sources for the notion of\nan ambiguous term said in a prior and a posterior sense are Algazel\nand Avicenna, both of whom became known in the second half of the\ntwelfth century, and both of whom used the notion to explain uses of\nthe word \u2018being\u2019.\n\nThe word \u2018analogical\u2019 soon became linked with the word\n\u2018ambiguous\u2019 in Latin authors. Speaking of the cuttlefish\nexample in his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Posterior\nAnalytics, Grosseteste says that Aristotle\u2019s use of analogy\nto find a common term produces ambiguous names said according to a\nprior and a posterior sense, and he uses the phrase\n\u201cambiguum analogum\u201d. In the same decade, the\nGlossa of the theologian Alexander of Hales links being said\nin a prior and a posterior sense with ambiguity and (in one possibly\nunreliable manuscript) with analogy, and the writings of Philip the\nChancellor also link being said in a prior and a posterior sense with\nanalogy. In logic textbooks, the word \u2018analogy\u2019 in the new\nsense appears in the Summe metenses, once dated around 1220,\nbut now thought to be by Nicholas of Paris, writing between 1240 and\n1260. The new use of \u2018analogy\u2019 rapidly became standard in\nboth logicians and theologians.\n",
