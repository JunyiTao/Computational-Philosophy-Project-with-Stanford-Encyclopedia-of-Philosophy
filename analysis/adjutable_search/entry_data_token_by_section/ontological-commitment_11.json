    "main_text": "Truthmaker Accounts of Ontological Commitment || Deep vs. Shallow Ontological Commitment\n3.2 Deep vs. Shallow Ontological Commitment\nThe truthmaker criterion for ontological commitment to kinds, as\nformulated above, strengthens the modal entailment criterion\n(\u00a72.2) since, necessarily,\nif Ks are among the truthmakers for T,\nthen Ks exist. Thus, on a truthmaker account, for a theory\nto be ontologically committed to Ks, it is required not only\nthat there exist Ks if the theory is true, but that there\nexist Ks that are truthmakers for the theory, if\nthe theory is true. The chief reason given for the strengthening\n(Cameron 2008, 2010) is this: if the Ks are\nnot fundamental entities, if they lack real\nexistence, then a theory can entail that Ks exist\nwithout thereby incurring ontological commitment to Ks. For\nexample, suppose one holds that, although it can truly be said that\nchairs exist, only (mereological) simples (or states of affairs\ninvolving those simples) are fundamental, or have real\nexistence. Moreover, suppose that only entities that are fundamental,\nor have real existence, can play the truthmaking role, in line with\nthe grounding account of truthmaking. Then, the (true) sentence\n\u2018chairs exist\u2019 is made true, not by chairs, but only by\nsimples arranged chairwise. It then follows on the truthmaker account\nof ontological commitment that \u2018chairs exist\u2019 is\ncommitted only to simples arranged chairwise, not to chairs. And,\narguably, this is the right result: chairs should not be counted\namong the ontological commitments of \u2018chairs exist\u2019\nbecause, on the view being supposed, they do not add to the\nontological cost of accepting \u2018chairs exist\u2019. In\nArmstrong's memorable phrase: they are \u201can ontological free\nlunch\u201d (Armstrong 1997: 12\u20133).  This result cannot be had\nby the quantifier account or the entailment account because these\naccounts are both insensitive to the crucial distinction between\nexistence and real existence. These accounts inevitably\novergenerate commitments, thus ruling out by fiat a minimal ontology\nthat accepts only simples.\nMuch more would have to be said in a defense of the truthmaker\naccount about the distinction between existence and real\nexistence.[32]\nBut let us suppose for what follows that the distinction is\nlegitimate, and has the ontological significance attributed to\nit. Still, one might wonder whether we have just changed the\nsubject. On the traditional notion of ontological commitment, as\nintroduced by Quine, it is supposed to be trivially true that\n\u2018Ks exist\u2019 is ontologically committed\nto Ks (see \u00a71.6.4). Instead of\nproviding an account of a theory's ontological commitment as\ntraditionally understood, the truthmaker account is an account of a\ntheory's fundamental ontological commitments. Looked at in\nthis way, the quantifier account and the truthmaker account are not\nin competition, and can live side by side (see Schaffer 2008). \nEven if the dispute is partly terminological, however, sometimes\nthe choice of terminology matters. It is important to be clear on what\nthe different notions of ontological commitment are, and how they fit\nin to the general project of ontology. Given a distinction between\nexistence and real existence, the notion of ontological commitment\nbifurcates into two distinct notions, one shallow and\none deep. On the shallow notion, entities that exist but do\nnot really exist are to be counted among the ontological commitments\nof a theory: it is trivial or analytic that \u2018Socrates\nexists\u2019 is committed to Socrates, and that \u2018elephants\nexist\u2019 is committed to elephants, whether or not Socrates or\nelephants have real existence. On the deep notion, only entities that\nreally exist count towards the theory's ontological\ncommitments. Ontological commitment, arguably, has traditionally been\ngiven the shallow interpretation; but that is because, within the\northodox Quinean setting, there simply is no ontologically relevant\ndistinction between existence and real existence. Once the distinction\nis accepted, however, and the project of ontology is construed to be\nthe project of discovering not what there is, but what\nthere really is, then it is only the deep notion of\nontological commitment that resonates with the ontological\n enterprise.[33] \nIt is an analysis of this deep notion, as given by the truthmaker \naccount, that matters for ontology.\nJust as there are shallow and deep notions of ontological\ncommitment, so there are shallow and deep notions of truthmaking.  On\nthe necessitation account of truthmaking, truthmaking is shallow:\nSocrates is a truthmaker for \u2018Socrates exists\u2019 and\nelephants are truthmakers for \u2018elephants exist\u2019, whether\nor not Socrates or elephants have real existence. On the grounding\naccount of truthmaking, truthmaking is deep: only real existents can\nserve as truthmakers.  Clearly, if we pair a shallow interpretation of\nontological commitment with a deep interpretation of truthmaking, then\na truthmaker account of ontological commitment is off the table: the\nontological commitments and the truthmakers of a theory will not be\naligned.  In evaluating a truthmaker account, then, it must be\nsupposed from the start that either both notions are taken to be\nshallow or both notions are taken to be deep. In what follows, both\nwill be taken to be deep in accord with the truthmaker theorist's\nintentions.\n",
