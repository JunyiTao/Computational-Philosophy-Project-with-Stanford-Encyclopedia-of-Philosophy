    "main_text": "\n\nHigher-order theories of consciousness try to explain the difference between unconscious and conscious mental states in terms of a relation obtaining\nbetween the conscious state in question and a higher-order\nrepresentation of some sort (either a higher-order perception of that\nstate, or a higher-order thought about it). The most\nchallenging properties to explain are those involved in\nphenomenal consciousness\u2014the sort of state that has a\nsubjective dimension, that has \u2018feel\u2019, or that it\nis like something to undergo. These properties will\nform the focus of this article. \n",
