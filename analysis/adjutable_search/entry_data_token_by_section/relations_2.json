We distinguished 3 senses of \u201cinternal\nrelation\u201d in our preliminary discussion: internal relations are\ndetermined by the mere existence of the things they relate, or\ninternal relations are determined by the intrinsic characters of the\nthings they relate, or internal relations supervene upon the intrinsic\ncharacters of the things they relate. So, in one sense or another, it\nsuffices for the obtaining of an internal relation that either the\nthings it relates exist or that the things it relates have\nsuch-and-such intrinsic characters. On this basis, some philosophers\nhave concluded that there is no need to admit internal relations as\nadditional pieces of furniture in the Universe (Fisk 1972:\n146\u20139; Armstrong 1978b: 86; Campbell 1990: 99\u2013101; Simons\n2010: 204\u20135; 2014: 314\u20135; Lowe 2013: 242, 2016:\n105\u20136; Heil 2009: 316\u20137, 2012: 144\u20136, 2016: 130,\nLowe 2016:102\u201311, Kein\u00e4nen 2020). Why do they think this?\nTruths about internal relations aren\u2019t necessarily equivalent to\ntruths about the things they relate or the intrinsic characters of the\nthings they relate. Nevertheless, all the truths about internal\nrelations are determined by the existence or the intrinsic characters\nof the things they relate, or supervene upon them. So internal\nrelations are variously declared to be \u201cno addition of\nbeing\u201d (Armstrong) or \u201cabsent from the fundamental\nontology\u201d (Heil) or, more clearly, \u201cthere are no such\nthings\u201d (Simons).\n\nConsider an example:\n\nBen Vorlich, a Scottish mountain, is taller than Ben Vane, its\nneighbour.\nBen Vorlich is 3094 ft high whilst Ben Vane is 3002 ft.\n\n\n(1) and (2) aren\u2019t necessarily equivalent because Ben Vorlich\nmight have been taller than Ben Vane even if Ben Vorlich and Ben Vane\nhad had different heights from the ones they actually have, i.e., (2)\ndoesn\u2019t follow from (1). Nevertheless, Ben Vorlich\u2019s being\ntaller than Ben Vane is determined by its having the height it does\n(3094 ft) and Ben Vane\u2019s having the height it does (3002 ft); it\nisn\u2019t possible for these mountains to have the heights they do\nwhilst Ben Vorlich fail to be taller than Ben Vane. So the being\ntaller than relation is internal in Armstrong\u2019s sense. This\nrelation is also internal in Lewis\u2019s sense which, recall, relies\nupon comparison between pairs of a relation\u2019s relata (Lewis\n1986: 62). Ben Lomond doesn\u2019t stand to Ben More as Ben Vorlich\ndoes to Ben Vane, because Ben Lomond is 3196 ft, Ben More, 3852 ft.\nHence Ben Vorlich\u2019s being taller than Ben Vane supervenes, in\nLewis\u2019s sense, upon the heights of Ben Vorlich and Ben Vane. So\nonce Ben Vorlich and Ben Vane have been bestowed with their respective\nheights there is no need to admit a further (internal) relation to\naccount for Ben Vorlich\u2019s being taller than Ben Vane (Campbell\n1990: 100, 103; Lewis 1994: 294).\n\nThis, broadly speaking, reductionist argument is open to question in a\nvariety of respects. Some philosophers have maintained that it cannot\nbe effective because we literally perceive proportions and other\ninternal relations (Mulligan 1991; Hochberg 2013: 232). These\nrelations must exist, otherwise we couldn\u2019t perceive them. So,\nthey conclude, something must have gone wrong with this argument\nbecause it leads to the mistaken conclusion that there aren\u2019t\nany internal relations out there to be perceived.\n\nMore generally, this reductionist argument assumes that if an internal\nrelation \\(R\\) isn\u2019t required to perform the role of determining\nthat \\(R\\) holds between the things it relates, because that role has\nalready been discharged by the intrinsic characteristics of the things\nit relates, then \\(R\\) doesn\u2019t exist at all or doesn\u2019t\nconstitute \u201can addition to the world\u2019s furniture\u201d\n(Armstrong 1997: 87). But from the fact that \\(R\\) doesn\u2019t\nfulfill one role it doesn\u2019t follow that it isn\u2019t required\nto fulfill another. It doesn\u2019t follow because there may still be\nother good reasons for us to believe that internal relations exist, or\nconstitute \u201can addition to the world\u2019s\nfurniture\u201d.\n\nTo bring the issues here into focus we will need to take on board two\nfurther distinctions. First, the distinction between\ntruth-making and ontological commitment. A\ntruth-maker for a statement \\(S\\) is (at least) something the\nexistence of which determines (necessitates) that \\(S\\) is true\n(Armstrong 2004: 5\u20137). By contrast, something \\(x\\) is an\nontological commitment of \\(S\\) if, roughly speaking, \\(S\\) could not\nbe true unless \\(x\\) existed (Quine 169: 95). Typically, a statement\n\\(S\\) incurs ontological commitment to an entity or some entities\nbecause we refer to it or quantify over them when we make the\nstatement. It\u2019s easy to run truth-making and\nontological commitment together but it\u2019s important to\nkeep them separate. A statement \\(S\\) cannot be true unless the\nentities to which \\(S\\) is ontologically committed exist. So\nit\u2019s a necessary condition of the truth of \\(S\\) that\nthe entities to which \\(S\\) is ontologically committed exist. By\ncontrast, it\u2019s a sufficient condition for the truth of\n\\(S\\) that a truth-maker for \\(S\\) exist because a truth-maker for\n\\(S\\) determines that \\(S\\) is true.\n\nArmed with the distinction between truth-making and ontological\ncommitment, we are now able to state a very general shortcoming of the\nargument. Let it be agreed that Ben Vorlich\u2019s being the height\nit is and Ben Vane\u2019s being the height it is together make true\nthe claim that Ben Vorlich is taller than Ben Vane; so no further\ntruth-makers are required for this claim to be true. But it\ndoesn\u2019t follow that we aren\u2019t ontologically committed to\nthe existence of an internal relation between Ben Vorlich and Ben Vane\nwhen we make this claim. We surely are ontologically committed to Ben\nVorlich and Ben Vane when we make the claim that one is taller than\nthe other even though they\u2019re not themselves truth-makers for\nthis claim. They\u2019re not truth-makers for this claim because they\nmight have existed even though Ben Vane was taller than Ben Vorlich or\nthe same height. But recognising that the class of ontological\ncommitments and the class of truth-makers for a given claim may be\ndifferent classes opens up the possibility that we may be\nontologically committed to an internal relation between Ben Vorlich\nand Ben Vane even though this relation isn\u2019t a truthmaker for\nthis claim either (MacBride 2011: 162\u20136).\n\nThe second distinction we need is between thick and\nthin relations (Mulligan 1998: 342\u20137). Some examples.\nThick relations: loves, kills, gives. Thin\nrelations: identity, resemblance, greater\nthan. Thick relations have more of a \u201cmaterial\u201d\ncontent and are less \u201cformal\u201d than thin relations. It\ncorrespondingly makes more sense to think of thick relations as\n\u201ctopic-neutral\u201d. Thin relations, by contrast to thick\nrelations, are typically internal (see Clementz 2014 and Johansson\n2014 for further discussion of the thick/thin distinction).\n\nWe are now equipped state another, more specific gap in the\nreductionist argument. Whilst Ben Vorlich and Ben Vane\u2019s having\nthe heights they do avoids the need to admit the existence of a thick\n(internal) relation that Ben Vorlich bears to Ben Vane, this\ndoesn\u2019t avoid the need to admit the existence of a thin\n(internal) relation. This is because we need to explain why Ben\nVorlich\u2019s having the height it does (3094 ft) and Ben\nVane\u2019s having the height it does (3004 ft) entails that Ben\nVorlich is taller than Ben Vane. The answer is that the thin relation\nbeing greater than holds between the number of feet in height\nthat Ben Vorlich has and the number of feet in height that Ben Vane\nhas (Russell 1903: \u00a7214; Bigelow & Pargetter 1990:\n55\u20136. So internal relations may not (in general) be required to\nperform the role of truth-makers for comparative claims. Nonetheless\nthin internal relations may perform an indispensable role in\nexplaining why the truth-makers for comparative claims are equipped to\nmake such claims true, rather than leaving this a matter of brute\ninexplicable necessity\u2014because, in this case, the heights of the\nmountains in question lie in a certain relation of proportion to one\nanother. Similarly Ben Vorlich\u2019s being taller than Ben\nVane\u2019s supervenes upon their heights but this is only\nintelligible because the height of Ben Vorlich is larger than the\nheight of Ben Vane.\n\nThis leaves us a choice. Either we can rewind the argument and admit\ninternal relations, whether thick or thin, as additions to the\nworld\u2019s furniture (Bigelow & Pargetter 1990: 56\u201360).\nOr we can adopt the more austere view that only admits thin (internal)\nrelations to hold amongst intrinsic characteristics (Mulligan 1998:\n347).\n\nThe situation may be summed up in schematic terms. There are true\ncomparative claims of the form \\(a\\Rel b\\) which are either determined\nto be true by, or supervene upon, the intrinsic natures of the things\nthey relate, \\(Fa \\amp Gb\\). Philosophers of a reductionist persuasion\nhave argued that this shows there is no need to admit an internal\nrelation \\((R)\\) over and above the intrinsic characteristics or\nmonadic foundations of the things related \\((F, G)\\). But the\nintrinsic characteristics of the things related only determine the\ntruth of the claim that \\(a\\Rel b\\), or the truth of the claim that\n\\(a\\Rel b\\) only supervenes upon \\(Fa \\amp Gb\\), because these\ncharacteristics stand in an internal relation themselves, \\(F \\fR G\\).\nBecause the monadic foundations, \\(Fa\\) and \\(Gb\\), are only empowered\nto determine that \\(a\\Rel b\\) because \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) lie in this\ninternal relation, \\(\\fR\\), it follows that internal relations still\nperform an indispensable role in our theorising about the world. One\nline of response to this argument is to deny that the ontological\ncommitments and the truth-makers for a claim might come apart by\ndefining ontological commitment in terms of truth making, by roughly\nspeaking, maintaining that to be is to be a truth-maker, but then an\nalternative theory of truth will need to be provided for ordinary and\nformal languages if quantificational structure is never ontologically\ncommitting and it unclear whether this can be done (Heil 2016: 129;\nMacBride 2018: 157).\n\nThe case against reductionism about internal relations has proceeded\nso far from a relatively a priori basis. But there\u2019s\nalso a case to be made against it on a posteriori grounds.\nGrant for the sake of argument the claim that if a relation is\ninternal then it doesn\u2019t count as an ontological addition. The\nsignificance of this claim, when it comes to providing an inventory of\nthe world\u2019s furniture, depends upon the extent to which\nrelational truths have monadic foundations. But relativity theory,\nquantum theory and even classical mechanics provide an a\nposteriori basis for doubting that there are very many, if any,\n\\(F\\)s and \\(G\\)s capable of serving as monadic foundations for target\n\\(R\\)s, i.e., intrinsic properties to which a significant range of\nrelations may be reduced.\n\nIt is often taken for granted by metaphysicians that the fundamental\nquantities of physics provide a ready source of monadic foundations\nbecause physical quantities are intrinsic characteristics. The vision\nof reality metaphysicians typically ascribe to physics is akin to\nLewis\u2019s doctrine of \u201cHumean Supervenience\u201d,\naccording to which there are intrinsic properties which need nothing\nbigger than a point to be instantiated and there\u2019s no difference\nwithout a difference in the arrangement of intrinsic properties over\npoints (Lewis 1986: ix\u2013xvi). And certainly some metaphysicians\nhave endeavoured to make good upon this vision, arguing, for example,\nthat velocity is an intrinsic property (Tooley 1988; Bigelow &\nPargetter 1990: 62\u201382). But not only is this view contentious,\nthere are many other notions in classical mechanics, such as force,\nstress, strain and elasticity, represented using vectors and tensors,\nthat belie the conception of fundamental physical quantities as\nintrinsic (Butterfield 2006, 2011).\n\nWhen we turn from classical mechanics to relativity theory and quantum\ntheory, the a posteriori case against conceiving physical\nquantities as intrinsic is even stronger. Consider mass and charge,\nmost metaphysicians\u2019 favourite and commonly relied upon examples\nof intrinsic properties of a piece of matter (in particular a point\nparticle). In relativity theory, mass is identified with energy\n(\u201cmass-energy\u201d). In a relativistic field theory, such as\nMaxwell\u2019s theory of electromagnetism, the all-pervading\nelectromagnetic field has mass-energy. It also has momentum, stress\nand other traditionally mechanical properties. So mass is no longer\nconceived as an intrinsic property of localized lumps of stuff, let\nalone of point particles. Furthermore, the attribution of mass,\nmomentum, stress, etc., to the electromagnetic field, or to a matter\nfield such as a continuous fluid, depends upon the metrical structure\nof spacetime. So these quantities are not intrinsic, but, rather,\nrelational properties. They are properties that the radiation or\nmatter field in question has in virtue of its relation to spacetime\nstructure (Lehmkuhl 2011).\n\nIn quantum theory there are even fewer candidates for intrinsic\nproperties. Even in elementary quantum mechanics, the closest analogue\nof a point particle as classically understood (\u201ca quantum\nparticle\u201d) is an all-pervading field, viz. an\nassignment, for each instant of time, of a (complex) number to every\npoint of space. Here, the mass of the quantum particle cannot be\nattributed to any single point of space, but must be associated with\nthe whole field, although not in the simple manner of \u201cspreading\nthe mass out\u201d as a classical mass density distribution. (The\nsame remark applies to the quantum particle\u2019s charge.) Turning\nto quantum field theory: here again, the notion of particle is\nradically changed from the idea of a classical point particle\nand from the idea of a quantum particle. There are not\nvarious quantum particles, each of them represented by a\ncomplex-valued field as above, and each of them, say, electrons.\nRather there is a single all-pervading electron field and\neach electron, as treated in elementary quantum mechanics, is replaced\nby a unit of energetic excitation of the electron field. The same goes\nfor other types of matter, such as quarks. According to quantum field\ntheory, quarks are really excitations of an all-pervading quark field.\nBesides, quantum field theory exhibits a second, and fundamentally\ndifferent, way in which mass and charge fail to be intrinsic\nproperties. This goes under the label of\n\u201crenormalization\u201d. In short, the mass and charge of a\nparticle \u00e0 la quantum field theory, i.e., a unit of\nexcitation of an all-pervading field, depends upon the length-scale at\nwhich you choose to describe, or to experimentally probe, the field\n(Butterfield 2014, 2015).\n\nSo, to sum up this case against reductionism about relations: there\nseem to be far fewer (if any) monadic physical properties than the\nreductionist view needs. But this it is not the only case that has\nbeen made. It has also been argued on the basis of quantum\nentanglement, the fact that the quantum states of entangled particles\ncannot be described independently of one another, that physics is\ncommitted to relations that don\u2019t supervene upon intrinsic\nproperties (Teller 1986). More radically, it has been argued that a\nconsideration of quantum entanglement pushes us towards the\nmetaphysical outlook that there are no intrinsic properties (Esfeld\n2004, 2016) or even that there are no objects but only relations\n(French & Ladyman 2003; Ladyman & Ross 2007: 130\u201389,\nLadyman 2016; for objections see Psillos 2001, 2006, Brince\u00f1o\n& Mumford 2016).\n\nConsider next the related suggestion that spatio-temporal relations\nare internal relations between, variously, space-time points, regions\nor events (Simons 2010: 207\u20138, 2014: 312\u20134; Simons 2016:\n2010: 207\u20138; Heil 2012: 147; Lowe 2016: 109\u2013111). General\nrelativity makes serious trouble for this suggestion. The thinking\nbehind the suggestion is that it belongs to the essential natures of\nspace-time points, etc., that they bear the catalogue of\nspatio-temporal relations they do. In philosophy of physics, the view\nis called \u201cmetrical essentialism\u201d, the doctrine that\npoints have their metrical properties and relations essentially\n(Maudlin 1988). From metrical essentialism it follows that the mere\nexistence of a point, etc., already suffices to determine that it\ninhabits this network of spatio-temporal relations. Hence, it is\nargued, there is no need to admit spatio-temporal relations, or at\nleast consider spatio-temporal relations as ontological additions to\nthe furniture of the Universe. But, as well as the a priori\nconcerns already aired, this argument for refusing to admit\nspatio-temporal relations as ontological additions is encumbered by\nthe a posteriori difficulties of the metrical essentialism it\npresupposes.\n\nThese difficulties for metrical essentialism arise from the fact that\nin general relativity space-time structure varies from one model,\ni.e., possible world, to another (Butterfield 1989: 16\u201327). We\ncannot leave points or regions to themselves to settle their internal\nrelations, because general relativity denies the idea of a\nspatial-temporal framework whose make-up is settled independently of\nthe matter or radiation. So there isn\u2019t a stable\nonce-and-for-all class of points or regions which once posited suffice\nfor the purposes of modern physics, hence no stable class of\ntruth-makers that suffice for making all the distance-duration claims\ntrue.\n\nIt may help to understand this debate about space-time points if we\nconsider the following line of response on behalf of metrical\nessentialism. According to metrical essentialism, points have their\nmetrical properties and relations, i.e., space-time framework,\nessentially. So if the space-time framework differs between models\nthen the points must differ between models too. But this view\nisn\u2019t compromised by the fact, as Butterfield (1989) points out,\nthat in general relativity the space-time framework varies from one\nmodel to another; it only follows that the points must vary between\nthese models too. What, however, this line of response fails to take\ninto account is how extremely fragile spatio-temporal relations must\nbe conceived to be when metrical essentialism is combined with general\nrelativity.\n\nTake a possible world which is truly described by a dynamical theory\nof space-time (i.e., described by general relativity and any likely\nsuccessor to it). Now take a second possible world which differs from\nthe first only with respect to a tiny change, on a millimeter scale as\nregards length, and on a milligram scale as regards mass. This\ninvolves altering spatio-temporal relations throughout the entire\nuniverse. Hence it\u2019s a consequence of metrical essentialism that\nin the second possible world, all space-time points are non-identical\nto those in the first. But surely it\u2019s implausible that such a\nsmall adjustment should add up to such a world-altering difference\n(thanks here to Jeremy Butterfield).\n\nWe are now in a position to evaluate David Lewis\u2019s claim that\nwhilst distance relations fail to supervene on the intrinsic\ncharacters of the things they relate, there is nevertheless a\ndifferent way in which relations of distance do supervene on intrinsic\ncharacter:\n\n\nIf, instead of taking a duplicate of the electron and a duplicate of\nthe proton, we take a duplicate of the whole atom, then it will\nexhibit the same electron-proton distance as the original atom.\nAlthough distance fails to supervene on the intrinsic nature of the\nrelata taken separately, it does supervene on the intrinsic nature of\nthe composite of the relata taken together \u2013 in this case the\ncomposite hydrogen atom. (1986: 62)\n\n\nThis remark has suggested to some philosophers that we can do away\nwith relations generally because we need only posit the composites\nupon whose intrinsic nature the relation supervenes (Parsons 2009:\n223\u20135). But Lewis\u2019s view and the more general form of\nreductionism inspired by it encounter a dilemma. Either (1) the\ncomposite is just the proton and electron taken together. But then the\ndistance between them fails to supervene upon the intrinsic character\nof the composite, because there are duplicates of the proton and\nduplicates of the electron that vary in distance. Or (2) the composite\nis more than just the proton and electron, i.e., the proton and\nelectron related together in some (external) way. But then we\nhaven\u2019t gotten rid of external relations in favour of internal\nones but only presupposed them.\n\nCan this dilemma for Lewis be sidestepped by the following manoeuvre?\nSuppose the composite is the mereological fusion of the proton and the\nelectron. Then can\u2019t we say that the fusion has its intrinsic\ncharacter, and the distance relation between the parts of the fusion\nsupervenes on this character?\n\nBut this can\u2019t be enough to say. We don\u2019t really have any\nidea of what the intrinsic properties of fusions are because the\naxioms of mereology are silent about the intrinsic characters of\nfusions. So we don\u2019t really have any idea of whether the\ndistance relations of their parts supervene upon their properties.\nPerhaps fusions don\u2019t have much, if any, intrinsic character!\nSince we don\u2019t know much about these things, we\u2019re not in\na position to rule out the possibility of a duplicate of Lewis\u2019s\nproton-electron fusion being a fusion that has parts which are a\ndifferent distance apart than the original proton and electron Lewis\ndescribed.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no logical bar to putting forward a theory\nthat posits a rich supply of fusions whose intrinsic natures are such\nthat the distance relations that hold between the parts of these\nfusions supervenes upon their intrinsic characters. But why believe\nsuch a theory? It\u2019s difficult to see how the supervenience of\ndistance relations upon intrinsic characters of fusions could ever be\nexplained (\u2019superdupervenience\u2019), because it\u2019s\ndifficult to see how an intrinsic property \\(F\\) of one thing \\(X\\)\ncan intelligibly give rise to an external relation \\(R\\) between two\nother things \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), even if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are parts of\n\\(X\\).\n\nFinally, in the light of the foregoing discussion, Lewis\u2019s view\nis open to an objection from physics: there is no absolute fact of the\nmatter about the distance between the electron and proton\nindependently of facts about the physical fields more generally, e.g.,\nthe electromagnetic field and the electron field, i.e., facts\nconcerning what is happening elsewhere. So the distance relation of\nthe electron and fusion cannot supervene upon the intrinsic character\nof the proton-electron fusion. It follows that distance relations\ncannot be external in Lewis\u2019s sense.\n",
