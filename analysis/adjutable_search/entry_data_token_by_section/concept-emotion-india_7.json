    "main_text": "The Buddhist account of the emotions || Buddhist emotions\n4.4 Buddhist emotions\n\nFrom the preceding arguments by the Buddhist philosophers\nDharmak\u012brti, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and\nKamala\u015b\u012bla it becomes clear that Buddhist philosophers do\nnot operate with the psychological category \u201cemotion\u201d; at\nleast not in the way that other Indian (and Western) philosophers do.\nFor example, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and Kamala\u015b\u012bla do\nnot consider love and hatred to be irrational because they involve\nnon-cognitive feelings that do not represent an external reality.\nKamala\u015b\u012bla in particular makes it clear that for him love\nand hatred do not require a relationship to objects in the external\nworld. He argues that not having an external object is a salient\nfeature of love and hatred. In Western philosophy of mind we often use\nthe presence or absence of an object of love in order to distinguish\nbetween rational and irrational love. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and\nKamala\u015b\u012bla, however, do not use this distinction in order to\nargue that love and hatred should be eliminated. As Buddhists, their\nconcern lies with the afflictions that prevent the mind from becoming\nliberated and whatever mental state is an affliction ought to be\neliminated. Emotions then are vij\u00f1\u0101nas and as\nsuch they always have an object. This position stands in contrast to\nphilosophical traditions, be they Indian or Western, in which feelings\nand emotions are often distinguished from cognitions because they lack\nan object.\n",
