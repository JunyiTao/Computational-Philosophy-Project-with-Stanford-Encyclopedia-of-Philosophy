    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\nAustin was born in Lancaster, England 26 March 1911 to Geoffrey\nLangshaw Austin and his wife Mary Austin (n\u00e9e Bowes-Wilson).\nThe family moved to Scotland in 1922, where Austin\u2019s father\nwas Secretary of St. Leonard\u2019s School, St. Andrews.\n\nAustin took up a scholarship in Classics at Shrewsbury School in 1924,\nand, in 1929, went on to study Classics at Balliol College, Oxford. In\n1933, he received a First in Literae Humaniores (Classics and\nPhilosophy) in 1933 and was elected to a Fellowship at All Souls\nCollege, Oxford. He undertook his first teaching position in 1935, as\nfellow and tutor at Magdalen College, Oxford.\n\nAustin\u2019s early interests included Aristotle, Kant, Leibniz, and\nPlato (especially Theaetetus). His more contemporary\ninfluences included especially G.E. Moore, John Cook Wilson, and H.A.\nPrichard. (Austin attended Prichard\u2019s undergraduate lectures\nwith such vigour that Prichard is reported to have made an\nunsuccessful attempt to exclude him.) It\u2019s plausible that some\naspects of Austin\u2019s distinctive approach to philosophical\nquestions derived from his engagement with the last three. All three\nphilosophers shaped their views about general philosophical questions\non the basis of careful attention to the more specific judgments we\nmake. And they took our specific judgments (for instance, in\nMoore\u2019s case, \u201cI know that I have hands\u201d) to be, in\ngeneral, more secure than more general judgments (for instance, again\nin Moore\u2019s case, \u201cI know things about external\nreality\u201d). Moreover, there are some continuities of doctrine,\nespecially with Cook Wilson and Prichard, which align Austin with an\n\u201cOxford Realist\u201d school of philosophy. The core components\nof the latter view are, first, that perception and knowledge are\nprimitive forms of apprehension and, second, that what we apprehend\nare ordinary elements of our environments that are independent of our\napprehending them. (All three thinkers were at one or another time\ncommitted to versions of both components of the position but for\ncomplex reasons sometimes wavered about the second. See e.g., Travis\nand Kalderon 2013.)\n\nDuring the Second World War, Austin served in the British Intelligence\nCorps. It has been said of him that, \u201che more than anybody was\nresponsible for the life-saving accuracy of the D-Day\nintelligence\u201d (reported in Warnock 1963: 9). Austin left the\narmy in September 1945 with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was\nhonoured for his intelligence work with an Order of the British\nEmpire, the French Croix de Guerre, and the U.S. Officer of the Legion\nof Merit. \n\nAustin married Jean Coutts in 1941. They had four children, two girls\nand two boys.\n\nAfter the War, Austin returned to Oxford. He became White\u2019s\nProfessor of Moral Philosophy in 1952. In the same year, he took on\nthe role of delegate to Oxford University Press, becoming Chairman of\nthe Finance Committee in 1957. His other administrative work for the\nUniversity included the role of Junior Proctor (1949\u201350), and\nChairman of the Sub-Faculty of Philosophy (1953\u201355). He was\npresident of the Aristotelian Society 1956\u201357. He gave the\nWilliam James Lectures in Harvard in 1955 (a version of the lectures\nwas published as How to Do Things With Words \u2013 see\n1962b in the Bibliography). He invented the card game CASE in 1951.\n\nDuring this period, Austin edited H.W.B. Joseph Lectures on the\nPhilosophy of Leibniz (1949) and produced a translation of\nGottlob Frege\u2019s Grundlagen der Arithmetik, so that it\ncould be set as an exam (1950). Austin wrote little and published\nless. Much of his influence was through teaching and other forms of\nsmall-scale engagement with philosophers. He also instituted a series\nof \u201cSaturday Morning\u201d discussion sessions, which involved\ndetailed discussions of a number of philosophical topics and works,\nincluding Aristotle\u2019s Nichomachean Ethics,\nFrege\u2019s Grundlagen, Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s\nPhilosophical Investigations, Merleau-Ponty\u2019s\nPhenomenology of Perception, and Noam Chomsky\u2019s\nSyntactic Structures.\n\nAustin died in Oxford on 8 February 1960.\n\n(For more detail about Austin\u2019s life, work, and influences see\nAyer 1978; Baldwin 2010; Berlin 1973b; Dancy 2010; Garvey 2014;\nGustaffson 2011; Hacker 2004; Hampshire 1960; Travis and Kalderon\n2013; Marion 2000a,b, 2009; Passmore 1957; Pears 1962; Pitcher 1973;\nSearle 2014; Urmson and Warnock 1961; Urmson 1967; Warnock 1963,\n1973a; Warnock 1989: 1\u201310.)\n",
