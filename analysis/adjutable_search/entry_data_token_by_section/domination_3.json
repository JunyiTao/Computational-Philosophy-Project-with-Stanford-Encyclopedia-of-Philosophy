    "main_text": "Does Domination Require the Exercise of Power? || Domination as a Power Structure\n3.1 Domination as a Power Structure\n\nOne of the most persistent recent disagreements concerns whether or\nnot domination requires the exercise of power. Neorepublicans tend to\nlink domination to what agents are in a position to do or\nhave the capacity to do rather than what agents actually do.\nThis is mostly because of the role domination plays within\nneorepublican ideas of freedom. The classical liberal theory of\nfreedom\u2014the neorepublican\u2019s primary competitor and\nfoil\u2014is supposedly defective just because it identifies freedom\nwith the absence of actual choice-interference.\nNeorepublicans say their advantage is the way they highlight how\npotential interference reduces freedom. This is the point of\nthe most famous example from the republican tradition: the slaves of a\nkind or lazy master are slaves nonetheless, and so are\nparadigmatically unfree even though their master is too kind or lazy\nto interfere with them.\n\nWhat does it look like to have power that counts as domination even\nthough unexercised? In addition to the language encountered above\nhighlighting the \u201ccapacities\u201d of the powerful,\nneorepublicans emphasize what Lovett (2010) calls the\nstructure instead of the outcome of dominating power\nrelations. Whether or not an employer can fire their employees at will\nis about how the employer/employee relationship is structured; whether\nor not an employer actually fires an employee, or whether or not the\nemployee manages not to starve because they have the job, manifests\nthe outcome of the relationship. This way of examining social\nrelationships looks away from how empowered agents exercise their\npower to the nature of that power itself. We do not stop objecting to\nparadigmatic dominators merely because they promise to make kind and\njudicious use of their powers; emancipation seems to require that they\ncease to have that kind of power. This highlights\nneorepublican doubts about whether self-regulation by the powerful can\nreduce domination (Lovett 2010: 97). At an extreme, Pettit has said\nthat domination persists without \u201cexternal checks that remove or\nreplace the interference option or put it cognitively off the\nmenu\u201d; that domination is reduced only by\n\u201cexogenous\u201d forces; or, if internal, forces that\n\u201cdisable\u201d in the manner of deep-seated neuroses (2012:\n63). \n",
