    "main_text": "Exceptions to informed consent || Benign interventions\n7.1 Benign interventions\n\nThe reality is that informed consent procedures are not legally\nmandated for the lion\u2019s share of medical care, e.g. standard\nblood draws, in contrast to more invasive interventions like surgery.\nIndeed, form filling, mandatory disclosures, and so forth are\nintuitively unnecessary for the former (Manson and O\u2019Neill 2007,\n81f). In medical research, United States federal regulations authorize\nreview boards to omit informed consent requirements on many occasions\nwhen \u201cresearch involves no more than minimal risk to the\nparticipants\u201d, a provision expanded in 2018. Again, this seems\nto make sense in many cases. A relatively safe and low-impact study\ncomparing two widely used drugs to ascertain which is best seems\nmorally permissible, even without a full-fledged informed consent\nprocess (Truog et al. 1999).\n\nSome authors have used such examples to downplay the need for informed\nconsent, criticizing what they call bioethicists\u2019\n\u201cfixation\u201d with informed consent (O\u2019Neill 2002,\n47\u20138; Brownsword 2004, 224). In response, some proponents of\ninformed consent insist that, in many of the alleged counter-examples,\nsomething in the way of informed consent remains vital. In blood\ndraws, in particular, when the patient is shown the needle and\nsilently stretches her arm forward, she is said to give tacit or\nnon-verbal consent (Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 107; and see also\nManson and O\u2019Neill 2007, 11). This particular response may be\ninsufficient. For example, when a busy nurse with many patients in\nline realizes that a patient is very ignorant about a blood draw, such\nthat her tacit consent is uninformed, intuitively the nurse does\nnot owe the patient a long explanation of the risks from a\nsanitized needle prick, which are remote and minor. \n\nTo some, this may suggest that fully-fledged informed consent\nrequirements simply do not apply to highly benign interventions.\nSurely the need to protect health and welfare, at least, through\ninformed consent procedures is lesser when that risk is negligible in\nthe first place. Interestingly, similar logic suggests that when an\nintervention is not benign yet informed consent cannot improve upon\nother protections, informed consent may be unnecessary. A possible\ncase in point is observational studies of anonymized electronic health\nrecords, where the main risk comes from breach of data security and\nconfidentiality\u2014a serious yet technical matter that few\nindividual patients could assess reliably\u2014and thus informed\nconsent (on top of expert input and democratic decision making) might\nbe an ineffective, unhelpful protection.\n\nStill, some elements of the requirement of informed consent must\nremain in place, even in standard blood draws and other benign\ninterventions (Dickert et al. forthcoming). Physical duress against a\nrefusing patient and the intentional exploitation of a patient\u2019s\nignorance about blood draws both usually remain wrong. This may\nsuggest that informed consent bundles together several requirements\nwith different levels of stringency. Some are necessary in more\ncontexts than others. It may also be thought to substantiate other\ntheories on the ground for informed consent. For example, above we\nmentioned the view that informed consent is necessary as a\npreventative bulwark against coercive or fraudulent practices. But on\nthat view, any exception for benign interventions might be impossible,\nsince these interventions would be just as coercive or fraudulent as\ninvasive ones. Thus, if sometimes it is correct for benign studies not\nto require informed consent, this calls this view into question. \n",
