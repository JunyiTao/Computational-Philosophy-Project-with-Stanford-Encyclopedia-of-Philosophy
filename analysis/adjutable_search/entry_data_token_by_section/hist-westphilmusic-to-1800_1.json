    "main_text": "Antiquity || The Universe as Harmony: Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans\n1.1 The Universe as Harmony: Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans\n\nNo writings survive that are directly attributable to Pythagoras (c.\n570\u2013c. 490 BCE). His view of music must therefore be\nreconstructed from the works of other Pythagoreans, or from more or\nless sympathetic accounts provided by other authors (a useful\ncollection of texts is found in Barker 1990: chapter 1). Central to\nPythagorean philosophy is the notion of harmony as the unity of\nvarious parts. In this sense, the concept has a much broader\napplication than to music, for harmony regulates the motion of\ncelestial bodies as well as the human soul (on the concept of harmony\nin ancient Greek philosophical thought, see Lippman 1964: chapter 1).\nIn the Pythagorean tradition, mathematics is the discipline that\ninvestigates harmony. Musical harmony is no exception to this, as the\ninterval of the octave may be expressed as a numerical ratio (2:1).\nThe octave may in turn be considered as the sum of a fifth (3:2) and a\nfourth (4:3). Pythagoras was generally credited with the discovery of\nthe relations between these intervals. These are best illustrated\nusing a monochord, an instrument constituted by a single string, the\nvibrating sections of which are determined by the position of a\nmovable bridge. However, it is unclear whether the monochord was in\nfact used by Pythagoras (Barker 2014: 186), and it is also plausible\nto assume that instrument makers had some understanding of these\nrelations before they became the object of intellectual\nspeculation.\n\nThe series of numbers involved in these ratios (1 to 4, thus adding up\nto 10) was considered sacred by the Pythagoreans, who named it\ntetraktys. This metaphysical view of music as a reflection of\ncosmic order proved to be enormously influential in Western musical\nthought. As the harmony found in music is essentially the same\nprinciple as the one that regulates both the cosmos and the human\nsoul, at least some Pythagoreans thought that their view could explain\nthe effects of music on the listener\u2019s mood and character.\n\nThe most notable opponent of the Pythagorean notion of celestial\nharmony was Aristotle. He offers two main reasons to reject this idea.\nFirst, he argues that physical bodies could not be composed of\nnumbers, for the latter have no weight, whereas the former do\n(Metaphysics, 14.3). Second, he observes that loud sounds\nshatter glass and produce a physical effect upon us. The movement of\nplanets in space, Aristotle argues, would produce an even greater\neffect on us, the absence of which is proof that celestial bodies\nproduce no sound (On the Heavens, 2.9). In addition to\nrejecting the idea of a celestial harmony, Aristotle also rejects the\nrelated notion that the human soul is a kind of harmony (On the\nSoul, 1.4).\n",
