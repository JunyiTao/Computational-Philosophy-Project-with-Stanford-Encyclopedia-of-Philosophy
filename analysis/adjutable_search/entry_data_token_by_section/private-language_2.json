    "main_text": "Overview: Wittgenstein\u2019s Argument and its Interpretations || Are Claims Affirming the Possibility of a Private Language False or Nonsense?\n1.2 Are Claims Affirming the Possibility of a Private Language False or Nonsense?\n\nIf someone were to insist that a private language is possible, one way\nto argue against him would be by employing the method of reductio\nad absurdum: assume that it is true that a private language is\npossible, show that that assumption leads to certain absurdities or a\ncontradiction, and then conclude that it is actually false that a\nprivate language is possible. This is the way in which the argument\nwas typically understood. But this understanding has come into\nquestion. In contrast to his earlier commentaries, for example, Gordon\nBaker has since called into question whether the private language\nsections should not be read as attempting to show that the notion of a\nprivate language is intelligible but false, but rather that it is\nnonsense masquerading as an important possibility (Baker, 1998).\n\nThere is, however, in Wittgenstein\u2019s thinking an inclination to think\nof contradiction in terms of the disintegration of sense, so that even\nargument by reductio might be understood not in terms of\nfalsehood. (The appearance of this inclination in Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus, for example, is well mapped by Fogelin\n[1995, Ch. IV].) And it is characteristic of Wittgenstein to talk of\nphilosophical error in terms of nonsense. In \u00a7119 of\nPhilosophical Investigations he writes, e.g., \u2018The\nresults of philosophy are the discovery of some piece of plain\nnonsense and of bumps that the understanding has got by running up\nagainst the limits of language. They\u00a0\u2014 these bumps \u2014\nmake us see the value of that discovery.\u2019 And in \u00a7464:\n\u2018What I want to teach is: to pass from unobvious nonsense to\nobvious nonsense.\u2019 In the discussion of the possibility of a\nprivate language it may well at first seem as though we understand the\npossibility under consideration. After all we seem to understand the\nquestion in \u00a7256, \u2018Now, what about the language which\ndescribes my inner experiences and which only I myself can\nunderstand?\u2019 But is Wittgenstein suggesting we only\nseem to understand this question? \n\nThe matter may not be clear. Shortly after the main private language\nsections, the following remark occurs as part of a dialogue, \u2018It\namounts to this: that only of a living human being and what resembles\n(behaves like) a living human being can one say: it has sensations; it\nsees; is blind; hears; is deaf; is conscious or unconscious\u2019\n(\u00a7281). The dialogue continues in \u00a7282:\n\n\n\u201cBut in a fairy tale a pot too can see and hear!\u201d\n(Certainly; but it can also talk.)\n\n\u201cBut a fairy tale only invents what is not the case: it does not\ntalk nonsense, does it?\u201d \u2014 It\u2019s not as simple as\nthat. Is it untrue or nonsensical to say that a pot talks? Does one\nhave a clear idea of the circumstances in which we\u2019d say of a pot that\nit talked? (Even a nonsense poem is not nonsense in the same way as\nthe babble of a baby.)\n\n\nHere the question of how the Investigations is to be read\nintrudes. For example, part of the distinction between what Mulhall\ncalls resolute and substantial readings of Wittgenstein concerns the\nsense in which Wittgenstein aimed to \u2018overcome our attraction to\nthe idea that there is something that we cannot do in\nphilosophy\u2019 (Mulhall, 2007, p. 8; cf. Philosophical\nInvestigations \u00a7374). Mulhall claims that that idea goes\nagainst the moral of Investigations \u00a7500:\n\u2018When a sentence is called senseless, it is not, as it were, its\nsense that is senseless. Rather, a combination of words is being\nexcluded from the language, withdrawn from circulation.\u2019\nFurther, this substantial reading attributes to Wittgenstein an\nimplicit philosophical theory of meaning, \u2018of the (now\ngrammatical) conditions of sense\u2014quite as if our everyday\nabilities to distinguish sense from nonsense require at the very least\na philosophical grounding or foundation (perhaps a criterial\nsemantics, or a theory of language-games, or an anthropology of the\nhuman life form\u2019 (Mulhall, 2007, p. 9). By contrast, on a\nresolute reading of Philosophical Investigations,\nWittgenstein\u2019s appeal to the notion of a grammatical investigation\ninvolves the deployment of \u2018our everyday capacity to distinguish\nsense from nonsense in a philosophical context, and hence as depriving\nitself of any claim to expertise or authority that exceeds that form\nof practical ability\u2014an ability that can equally well be laid\nclaim to by any competent speaker, and hence by any philosophical\ninterlocutor\u2019 (ibid., p. 10). Further, the resolute reading is\nespecially firm in rejecting the idea that there is something\ndeterminate that we cannot do, the idea that there is something,\nnamely, a private language, that cannot be achieved; there is not a\nlimitation on language. Rather, the idea is simply nonsense, or as\nMulhall later puts it (ibid. p. 18): no sense can be given to the idea\nof a philosophically substantial private language.\n\nThough Mulhall claims that the private language sections can\njustifiably be read either resolutely or substantially\u2014because\n\u2018each reading can \u2026 point to an aspect of the text that\nit fully acknowledges, and whose proper acknowledgment by the other is\nat the very least an issue for it, it would seem profitless to insist\nthat one reading is essentially faithful to Wittgenstein\u2019s text and\nthe other intrinsically faithless\u2019 (ibid., p. 20)\u2014it is\nplain that he thinks the resolute reading is to be preferred. However,\nwe may not need to choose. We might view the private language sections\nas Wittgenstein\u2019s asking, \u2018Do we have a clear picture of the\ncircumstances in which we should say that someone spoke a private\nlanguage?\u2019 The line of reasoning that follows \u00a7243 can be\nread as various attempts to achieve a clear picture of what it might\nmean to speak a private language, where the attempts ultimately fail,\nwith the result that what at first sight seemed intelligible (\u2018a\nlanguage which describes my inner experiences and which only I myself\ncan understand\u2019) turns out not to be intelligible after all. And\nin so far as we cannot make intelligible the circumstances in which\nthere could be a private language, we should say that the idea of a\nprivate language is nonsense. However, as we saw above, in \u00a7282\nWittgenstein seems to suggest that the border between nonsense and\nfalsehood is itself unclear; and moreover, in trying to make sense of\nthe possibility of a private language, we may find, in different parts\nof the chain of reasoning, suggestions of falsehood as well as of\nnonsensicality. \n",
