    "main_text": "The Singular Term Argument || Logical Objects\n4.6 Logical Objects\n\nFrege (1884, 1893\u20131903) appealed to sentences like the\nfollowing:\n\n(D) The number of Fs is identical to the number of\nGs if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence\nbetween the Fs and the Gs.\n\n\n(E) The direction of line a is identical to the direction of\nline b if and only if a is parallel to\nb.\n\n(F) The shape of figure a is identical to the shape of figure\nb if and only if a is geometrically similar\nto b.\n\n\nOn Frege's view, principles like these are true, and so they commit us\nto the existence of numbers, lines, and shapes. Now, of course, we\nhave already gone through a platonistic argument \u2014 indeed, a\nFregean argument \u2014 for the existence of numbers. Moreover, the\nstandard platonist view is that the argument for the existence of\nmathematical objects is entirely general, covering all branches of\nmathematics, including geometry, so that on this view, we already have\nreason to believe in lines and shapes, as well as numbers. But it is\nworth noting that in contrast to most contemporary platonists, Frege\nthought of numbers, lines, and shapes as logical objects, because on\nhis view, these things can be identified with extensions of\nconcepts. What is the extension of a concept? Well, simplifying a\nbit, it is just the set of things falling under the given concept.\nThus, for instance, the extension of the concept white is\njust the set of white\n things.[13]\n And so the idea here is that since logic is centrally concerned with\npredicates and their corresponding concepts, and since extensions are\ntied to concepts, we can think of extensions as logical objects. Thus,\nsince Frege thinks that numbers, lines, and shapes can be identified\nwith extensions, on his view, we can think of these things as logical\nobjects.\n\nFrege's definitions of numbers, lines, and shapes in terms of\nextensions can be formulated as follows: (i) the number of Fs\nis the extension of the concept equinumerous with F (that is,\nit is the set of all concepts that have exactly as many objects\nfalling under them as does F); and (ii) the direction of line\na is the extension of the concept parallel to a; and\n(iii) the shape of figure a is the extension of the concept\ngeometrically similar to a. A similar approach can be used to\ndefine other kinds of logical objects. For instance, the truth value\nof the proposition p can be identified with the extension of\nthe concept equivalent to p (i.e., the concept true if\nand only if p is true).\n\nIt should be noted that contemporary neo-Fregeans reject the\nidentification of directions and shapes and so on with extensions of\nconcepts. They hold instead that directions and shapes are sui\ngeneris abstract objects.\n\nFor contemporary work on this issue, see, e.g., Wright (1983), Boolos\n(1986\u201387), and Anderson and Zalta (2004).\n",
