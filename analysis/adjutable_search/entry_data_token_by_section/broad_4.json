    "main_text": "Perception || Na\u00efve Realism Dismantled\n2.3 Na\u00efve Realism Dismantled\n\nNa\u00efve Realism, properly articulated, says that when we perceive a\nphysical object it is only a part of the apple that is sensuously\nmanifested to us: this, and only this, is an objective constituent in\nthe perceptual situation. Now can this view be defended? Broad does\nnot think so. He levels several arguments against Na\u00efve Realism,\ntwo of which will receive attention here.\n\nThe Argument from Hallucination. Consider a\nveridical perception and compare it with a subjectively\nindistinguishable delusive or hallucinatory perception, for example\nthat of a drunkard hallucinating a pink rat. Neither a pink rat nor a\npart of a pink rat could be a sensuously manifested constituent in the\ndelusive situation.\n\nAnd, since there is no relevant internal difference between the\nveridical and the delusive perceptual situation, it is reasonable to\nsuppose that in no case does a perceptual situation contain\nas a constituent the physical object which corresponds to its\nepistemological object, even when there is such a physical object.\n(1925, p. 156; italics added.)\n\n\nIt might be held that the subjective indistinguishability of a\nveridical perceptual and a hallucinatory situation entails\nthat the experiences have an identical constitution (and that,\ntherefore, no material object is a constituent even in the veridical\nsituation). That is, however, not Broad\u2019s position: it\ncould be that a material object is an objectively\nmanifested constituent in a veridical situation (whilst not in the\nindistinguishable hallucinatory situation). He holds, however, that\nthat is not the more reasonable view of the matter.\n\nThe Argument from Illusion. Consider a person perceiving a\npenny from a series of slightly different angles and distances. He\nwould unhesitatingly assume that in each of the slightly differing\nperceptual situations the facing brownish surface of a certain penny\nis sensuously manifested to him. But in Broad\u2019s view this could\nnot be so: \u201cIf he carefully inspects the objective constituents\nof these perceptual situations he will certainly find that they seem\nto be of different shapes and sizes\u201d (1925, p. 158). The\nobjective constituent will in most of the situations seem\nelliptical rather than circular. This indicates, Broad\nclaims, that in each perceptual situation, the constituent\u2014the\nsensuously manifested item\u2014cannot be the top of the penny. What\nhappens is that instead of being immediately aware of the circular\nsurface of the penny (as he takes himself to be) he is immediately\naware of an elliptical item, an elliptical sensum. Hence it is an\nelliptical sensum rather than the circular surface of the penny that\nis manifested to the subject. The same holds mutatis mutandis\nwhen we perceive a white sheet of paper dimly lit by a candle. On\ncareful consideration it seems clear that the paper looks yellowish to\nus. So what we are immediately aware of is a yellowish sensum rather\nthan the white sheet of paper we are looking at.\n\nIn order to bring out at least some of the facets of Broad\u2019s\ntheory it seems advisable to turn to a few of the many objections that\nhave been raised against it.\n\n(1) It has sometimes been objected that the argument from illusion is\nflawed from the start since there is usually no risk of anyone being\ntaken in by the situation. Broad\u2019s response to this objection is\nclear. When we look at the penny from an oblique angle it appears\nelliptical, but not in the sense that anyone is taking in by\nthe situation, and mistakenly comes to believe or judge that the penny\nis elliptical. He is explicit on the point: \u201c\u2018looking\nelliptical to me\u2019 stands for a peculiar experience, which,\nwhatever the right analysis of it may be, is not just a mistaken\njudgement about the shape\u201d (1923, p. 237). The penny\nsensibly appears elliptical. And it is this rather than any\nsupposed tendency to be deceived which creates problem for Na\u00efve\nRealism (pace Austin 1962, p. 26).\n\n(2) It has often been objected that philosophers who have made use of\nthe argument from illusion that they neglect the fact of\nperceptual constancy. In his later works Broad admits that\nthis complaint is justified. However, the \u201crecognition of the\nphenomenon of constancy merely shifts the point of application of the\nargument\u201d (1947b, p. 112). There is a class of perceptual\nexperiences of a material object, X, where constancy holds;\nthere is also a class of experiences of X where constancy\nbreaks down. In theory it is logically possible to hold that the\nfacing surface of X is sensuously presented in the perceptual\nexperiences belonging to the first class but not in the experiences\nbelonging to the second class. \u201cBut, in view of the continuity\nbetween the most normal and the most abnormal cases of seeing, such a\ndoctrine would be utterly implausible and could be defended only by\nthe most desperate special pleading\u201d (1952a, p. 9).\n\nWhat I just said might create the impression that Broad\u2019s\nphenomenology is rather unsophisticated or crude. On the whole that is\ncertainly not the case. For example, he points out that \u201cthe\nvisual field\u201d is three-dimensional: \u201cA sphere does\nlook different from a circle, just as a circle looks\ndifferent from an ellipse\u201d (1923, p. 290; Broad\u2019s\nemphasis). And the same holds, mutatis mutandis, for the\nintimately related characteristics distance and depth; these are also\npurely visual characteristics of the visual field (pp.\n 295\u2013300).[5]\n\n(The constancy objection to any argument of illusion that appeals to\ncases such as the penny seen obliquely is a compelling one, to say the\nleast. In spite of that I will, for convenience of exposition,\noccasionally make use of the example below.)\n\n(3) A stock objection to sense-data theories has been that they invite\nscepticism with regard to the external world. Broad regrets the\nsceptical consequences but\u2014given the strength of the case for\nthe sense-datum theory\u2014does not consider them sufficient grounds\nfor dismissal. Seeking to preserve as much as possible of the common\nsense notion of material objects he argues for the existence of such\nobjects conceived of as having \u201cprimary qualities\u201d such as\nshape, size, and position (apart from such properties as electric\ncharge and mass). (1925, pp. 195\u2013204.) Not surprisingly, he\nrejects the idea that material objects have \u201csecondary\nproperties\u201d such as (phenomenal) redness or (phenomenal)\nhotness. Broad is perfectly clear that it does not follow\nfrom the fact that such properties are never sensuously manifested in\nour perceptual experiences that the material objects causing our\nexperiences lack these properties: it does remain possible that there\nare red and green, hot and cold material objects even though they are\nnot objects of acquaintance. He argues, however, that there is no\nreason to believe that material objects have these properties. (1925,\npp. 205\u20136.)\n",
