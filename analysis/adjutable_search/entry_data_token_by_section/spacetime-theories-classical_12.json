    "main_text": "Leibniz || The Ideality of Space\n6.1 The Ideality of Space\n\nArguably, Leibniz\u2019s views concerning space and motion do not\nhave a completely linear logic, starting from some logically\nsufficient basic premises, but instead form a collection of mutually\nsupporting doctrines. If one starts questioning why Leibniz held\ncertain views \u2013 concerning the ideality of space, for instance\n\u2013 one is apt to be led in a circle. Still, exposition requires\nstarting somewhere, and Leibniz\u2019s argument for the ideality of\nspace in the Correspondence with Clarke is a good place to\nbegin. But bear in mind the caveats made here \u2013 this argument\nwas made later than a number of other relevant writings, and its\nlogical relation to Leibniz\u2019s views on motion is complex.\n\nLeibniz (LV.47 \u2013 this notation means Leibniz\u2019s Fifth\nletter, section 47, and so on) says that (i) a body comes to have the\n\u2018same place\u2019 as another once did, when it comes to stand\nin the same relations to bodies we \u2018suppose\u2019 to be\nunchanged (more on this later); (ii) that we can define \u2018a\nplace\u2019 to be that which any such two bodies have in common (here\nhe claims an analogy with the Euclidean/Eudoxan definition of a\nrational number in terms of an identity relation between ratios); and\nfinally that (iii) space is all such places taken together. However,\nhe also holds that properties are particular, incapable of\nbeing instantiated by more than one individual, even at different\ntimes; hence it is impossible for the two bodies to be in\nliterally the same relations to the unchanged bodies. Thus the thing\nthat we take to be the same for the two bodies \u2013 the place\n\u2013 is something added by our minds to the situation, and only\nideal. As a result, space, which is constructed from these ideal\nplaces, is itself ideal: \u2018a certain order, wherein the mind\nconceives the application of relations\u2019.\n\nContrast this view of space with those of Descartes and of Newton.\nBoth Descartes and Newton claim that space is a real, mind-independent\nentity; for Descartes it is matter, and for Newton a\n\u2018pseudo-substance\u2019, distinct from matter. And of course\nfor both, these views are intimately tied up with their accounts of\nmotion. Leibniz simply denies the mind-independent reality of space,\nand this too is bound up with his views concerning\n motion.[10]\n",
