    "main_text": "The Modal Collapse Objection to DDS || Solutions to the Problem of Modal Collapse\n7.4 Concluding Aporetic Postscript\n\nNone of the above responses to the modal collapse objection to divine\nsimplicity is without problems. And so it is fitting that we end on an\naporetic note. If there is a way beyond the impasse it will have to\ninvolve a deeper dive into the metaphysics of divine action in its\nrelation to the metaphysics of modality. How are to to understand\ndivine creation? Does God create out of nothing? Out of himself? Out\nof pre-given possibilities? The MCA\u2019s main value is as a\nconcrete point of entry into this constellation of difficult\nquestions.\n\nWhat holds for MCA holds also for all the problems surrounding DDS\ndetailed above. This final subsection therefore serves as a fitting\nconclusion to the entire entry.\n",
