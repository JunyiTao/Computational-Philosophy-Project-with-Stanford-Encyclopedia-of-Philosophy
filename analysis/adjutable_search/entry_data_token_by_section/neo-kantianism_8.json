    "main_text": "The Southwest School || Theory of Knowledge\n3.3 Philosophy of Historical Sciences\n\nWindelband\u2019s most influential and widely-read work, and indeed,\nthe most influential and widely-read of all of the SW Neo-Kantian\nwritings, is his essay, \u201cHistory and Natural Science\u201d.\nThis essay is a contribution to the philosophical debate sparked by\nthe 19th century explosion in what we might call the human\nsciences\u2014principally history, but also comparative linguistics,\nanthropology, and comparative religion\u2014that seemed rigorous and\nso \u201cscientific\u201d, but that seemed to differ fundamentally\nfrom paradigm mathematical natural sciences such as\n physics.[24]\n Windelband\u2019s chief claim is that there is an irreducible\nmethodological difference (or, as he puts it, a \u201clogical\u201d\ndifference) between history and the natural sciences.\n\n\n[W]e have before us a purely methodological classification of the\nempirical sciences that is grounded upon sound logical concepts. The\nprinciple of classification is the formal property of the theoretical\nor cognitive objectives of the science in question. One kind of\nscience is an inquiry into general laws. The other kind of science is\nan inquiry into specific historical facts. In the language of formal\nlogic, the objective of the first kind of science is the general,\napodictic judgment; the objective of the other kind of science is the\nsingular, assertoric proposition. (Windelband 1894: 291)\n\n\nThose sciences, such as mathematical physics, whose goal is to produce\ngeneral laws are called \u201cnomothetic\u201d; those sciences, such\nas history, whose goal is to know a unique, singular individual, are\ncalled \u201cidiographic\u201d. The individual that is the subject\nof idiographic sciences need not be an individual human being, such as\nCaesar. It could be a unique event or sequence of events (the fall of\nthe Roman empire); an individual nation, language, religion, or\nculture (Florence during the Renaissance); or a unique artifact of\nliterature, art, or science (Homer\u2019s Iliad). The\nimportant point is that an idiographic science has as its goal to\nunderstand an individual in all its\n uniqueness.[25]\n Nomothetic sciences want to know laws; idiographic sciences want to\nknow unique processes. The nomothetic seeks the general, and what\nhappens invariably; the idiographic seeks the particular, and what\nonly happens once. Nomothetic sciences begin with what is given to\nintuition [Anschauung], but ascend to what is abstract and no\nlonger intuitive; idiographic sciences proceed in the opposite\ndirection, attempting to resurrect and reproduce a unique individual\nin all its vitality, detail, and intuitiveness\n[Anschaulichkeit].\n\nWindelband\u2019s chief target is the positivist philosophy of\nhistory, defended by Comte, Mill, and others. On this view, the method\nof history ought to be fundamentally the same as that of the natural\nsciences, and its goal ought to be the discovery of general laws that\nexplain and predict historical\n events.[26]\n A secondary target of this essay is the view that history and the\nnatural sciences can be distinguished principally in terms of their\nsubject matter. This view is expressed by the terms\n\u201cNaturwissenschaften\u201d (sciences of nature) and\n\u201cGeisteswissenschaften\u201d (sciences of\n\u201cmind\u201d or \u201cspirit\u201d), which Dilthey introduced\nin his 1883 book Introduction to the Geisteswissenschaften.\nWindelband objects that when the distinction among the sciences is\ndrawn in this way, psychology ends up as a\nGeisteswissenschaft like history; indeed psychology, as the\nempirical science of the mind, ought to be the fundamental\nGeisteswissenschaft on which all other\nGeisteswissenschaften depend. But, Windelband argues,\npsychology is methodologically just as much a \u201cnomothetic\u201d\nscience as physics is: both try to discover mathematical laws of their\nphenomena through controlled\n experimentation.[27]\n And the amount of psychology that a historian needs does not go\nbeyond what is supplied by reflective common sense; the new\ndiscoveries of empirical psychologists have been, and are likely to\nbe, of no special significance for\n historians.[28]\n\nThe conception of history first sketched in Windelband\u2019s\n\u201cHistory and Natural Science\u201d was thoroughly elaborated\nand expanded in Rickert\u2019s The Limits of Concept Formation in\nNatural Science. Rickert improves on Windelband\u2019s view in\ntwo principal ways: he systematically develops Windelband\u2019s idea\nthat the distinction between history and natural science must be\ngrounded in logic, and he connects the distinction in kinds\nof sciences to the characteristic SW distinction between fact and\nvalue.\n\nAs Rickert\u2019s title emphasizes, he conceived of history as a\nlogical notion, as a certain way of forming concepts. The traditional\nlogic, he claims, considers only concepts formed by abstracting away\nfrom individual particularities to form general representations. But\nthis method has its limit: it cannot explain how we form concepts of\nindividuals. History is a logical procedure for forming\nconcepts of individuals, as, for instance, a historical work on Caesar\nwould produce a concept of Caesar. In calling the products of\nhistorical research \u201cconcepts\u201d, Rickert is combating the\nview that a historian merely collects facts and reports them. Rather,\nthe historian sifts through the potentially infinite number of facts\nabout her subject and isolates, using some principle of selection, the\nfacts about her subject that are essential for\n history.[29]\n Though Rickert employs the traditional logical notion of an\nindividual to characterize the subject of historical concepts, he uses\nthe term in a distinctive way. Individuals are unique and\nthey are indivisible or irreplaceable. An adequate\nhistorical concept of Julius Caesar needs to include those features\nthat make him unique, and unlike any other individual. Rickert uses\nthe example of the Koh-i-noor diamond to illustrate the indivisibility\nor irreplaceability of an historical individual. Of course there are\ndistinctive facts about this diamond that distinguish it from all\nother hunks of carbon; but the same could be said of any lump of coal.\nHowever, from the point of view of history, it is indifferent whether\none lump of coal that was used to power a locomotive carrying Queen\nVictoria would have been destroyed and replaced by some other lump of\ncoal. But, from the point of view of history, the massive diamond that\nthe Queen herself was wearing is hardly replaceable. Furthermore,\nRickert insisted that historical concepts, although they are of an\nindividual, are nonetheless general in the sense that the\nprinciples of selection employed in forming these concepts are\nuniversally valid for all\n historians.[30]\n\nWhen Rickert insists that concepts of historical individuals are\nformed through employing principles of selection that are universally\nvalid, he is bringing into the philosophy of history the\ncharacteristic SW distinction between fact and value. The principles\nof selection are given by values. The Koh-i-noor diamond is a\nhistorical individual because it is widely held to be uniquely\nbeautiful, and it forms a central part of the crown jewels of the\nBritish monarch; it is thus related, say, to the values of beauty,\nsocial order, and national\n identity.[31]\n Rickert therefore concludes that \u201cthe claim that historical\nconcepts have an unconditionally general validity presupposes the\nacknowledgment of unconditionally general values\u201d (Rickert 1902:\n360). The SW view of history thus attempts to thread the needle\nbetween positivism and more radical forms of historicism: it makes\nhistory an autonomous science, without falling into relativism.\n(Clearly, in arguing that the concepts of history are objectively\nvalid, despite the fact that history does not include universal laws,\nthe SW Neo-Kantians are rejecting the Marburg view that objective\nvalidity depends on laws. This is a paradigm case where their\ndiffering conceptions of objective validity, as normative or\nnomological, are brought to bear.) Indeed, Rickert claims that there\nare certain a priori conditions of history, just as Kant had claimed\nin the first Critique that there are certain a priori\nconditions for natural science. It is a priori that every historical\nindividual is value-relevant. It is also a priori that there are\ncertain values, such as beauty or social order, that are universally\nvalid. Inasmuch as a culture is a collection of values, or\nvalue-relevant individuals, the most apt way of characterizing the\nsubject matter of a science like history is as a science of\nculture, as opposed to a science of mind\n (Geisteswissenschaft).[32]\n",
