    "main_text": "Building Blocks of Modern Theories of Information || Physics\n3.4 Physics\n\nGalileo (1623) already had suggested that the analysis of phenomena\nlike heat and pressure could be reduced to the study of movements of\nelementary particles. Within the empirical methodology this could be\nconceived as the question how the sensory experience of the secondary\nquality of heat of an object or a gas could be reduced to movements of\nparticles. Bernoulli (Hydrodynamica published in 1738) was\nthe first to develop a kinetic theory of gases in which\nmacroscopically observable phenomena are described in terms of\nmicrostates of systems of particles that obey the laws of Newtonian\nmechanics, but it was quite an intellectual effort to come up with an\nadequate mathematical treatment. Clausius (1850) made a conclusive\nstep when he introduced the notion of the mean free path of a particle\nbetween two collisions. This opened the way for a statistical\ntreatment by Maxwell who formulated his distribution in 1857, which\nwas the first statistical law in physics. The definitive formula that\ntied all notions together (and that is engraved on his tombstone,\nthough the actual formula is due to Planck) was developed by\nBoltzmann: \n\\[\nS = k \\log W\n\\]\n\n\nIt describes the entropy S of a system in terms of the\nlogarithm of the number of possible microstates W, consistent\nwith the observable macroscopic states of the system, where k\nis the well-known Boltzmann constant. In all its simplicity the value\nof this formula for modern science can hardly be overestimated. The\nexpression \u201c\\(\\log W\\)\u201d can, from the perspective of\ninformation theory, be interpreted in various ways:\n\nAs the amount of entropy in the system.\nAs the length of the number needed to count all possible\nmicrostates consistent with macroscopic observations.\nAs the length of an optimal index we need to identify the\nspecific current unknown microstate of the system, i.e., it is a\nmeasure of our \u201clack of information\u201d.\nAs a measure for the probability of any typical specific\nmicrostate of the system consistent with macroscopic\nobservations.\n\n\nThus it connects the additive nature of logarithm with the extensive\nqualities of entropy, probability, typicality and information and it\nis a fundamental step in the use of mathematics to analyze nature.\nLater Gibbs (1906) refined the formula: \n\\[\nS = -\\sum_i p_i \\ln p_i,\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(p_i\\) is the probability that the system is in the\n\\(i^{\\textrm{th}}\\) microstate. This formula was adopted by Shannon\n(1948; Shannon & Weaver 1949) to characterize the communication\nentropy of a system of messages. Although there is a close connection\nbetween the mathematical treatment of entropy and information, the\nexact interpretation of this fact has been a source of controversy\never since (Harremo\u00ebs & Tops\u00f8e 2008; Bais & Farmer\n2008).\n",
