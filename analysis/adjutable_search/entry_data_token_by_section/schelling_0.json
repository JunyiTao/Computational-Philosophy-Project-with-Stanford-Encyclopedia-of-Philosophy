    "main_text": "Career\n1. Career\n\nSchelling was born in Leonberg near Stuttgart on 27 January 1775. He\nattended a Protestant seminary in T\u00fcbingen from 1790 to 1795,\nwhere he was close friends with both Hegel and the poet and\nphilosopher Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin. He moved to Leipzig in 1797,\nthen to Jena, where he came into contact with the early Romantic\nthinkers, Friedrich Schlegel and Novalis, and, via Goethe\u2019s\ninfluence, took up his first professorship from 1798 to 1803. From\n1803 to 1806 he lived in W\u00fcrzburg, whence he left for Munich,\nwhere he mainly lived from 1806 onwards, with an interruption from\n1820 to 1827, when he lived in Erlangen. He moved to Berlin in 1841 to\ntake up what had, until Hegel\u2019s death in 1831, been\nHegel\u2019s chair of philosophy. Although his lectures in Berlin\nwere initially attended by such luminaries as Kierkegaard, Engels,\nBakunin, Ranke, Burkhardt, and Alexander von Humboldt, he soon came to\nbe largely ignored by most of the leading thinkers of the day. It is\nclear, however, that his philosophical thought still influenced many\nwho rejected him on mainly political grounds. He died on 20 August\n1854 in Bad Ragaz, Switzerland. Schelling\u2019s influence on many\ndirections in modern philosophy has been seriously underestimated in\nthe English-speaking world, though sustained new attention to his work\nin recent years has increasingly brought him into contemporary debates\nabout naturalism, freedom, aesthetics, epistemology, and ontology.\n",
