    "main_text": "Aristotelian Tenets, Platonic Tenets, and More\n4. Aristotelian Tenets, Platonic Tenets, and More\n\nThe principal tenets of the Aristotelian natural philosophy were: the\ndoctrine of form and matter, the four causes, the rigid separation of\nthe world into opposed spheres, and the finite nature of the universe.\nDuring the Renaissance, these precepts were both defended and revised\nby Aristotelian professors, or challenged by others who sought to\ndismantle traditional philosophy. While these new philosophers could\nrely on new evidence, methods, and observations to define the nature\nof the universe, in other cases the rejection of Aristotelian\ndoctrines and their substitution with new paradigms was mainly based\non speculative arguments. \n",
