    "main_text": "Honesty with Respect to Property || The Origin of Material Honesty\n10.2 The Origin of Material Honesty\n\n\nHume next poses two questions about the rules of ownership of property\nand the associated virtue of material honesty: what is the artifice by\nwhich human beings create them, and why do we attribute moral goodness\nand evil to the observance and neglect of these rules?\n\n\nBy nature human beings have many desires but are individually\nill-equipped with strength, natural weapons, or natural skills to\nsatisfy them. We can remedy these natural defects by means of social\ncooperation: shared strength, division of labor, and mutual\naid in times of individual weakness. It occurs to people to form a\nsociety as a consequence of their experience with the small family\ngroups into which they are born, groups united initially by sexual\nattraction and familial love, but in time demonstrating the many\npractical advantages of working together with others. However, in the\nconditions of moderate scarcity in which we find ourselves, and given\nthe portable nature of the goods we desire, our untrammeled greed and\nnaturally \u201cconfined generosity\u201d (generosity to those dear\nto us in preference to others) tends to create conflict or undermine\ncooperation, destroying collaborative arrangements among people who\nare not united by ties of affection, and leaving us all materially\npoor. No remedy for this natural partiality is to be found in\n\u201cour natural uncultivated ideas of morality\u201d (T 3.2.2.8);\nan invention is needed.\n\n\nHume argues that we create the rules of ownership of property\noriginally in order to satisfy our avidity for possessions for\nourselves and our loved ones, by linking material goods more securely\nto particular individuals so as to avoid conflict. Within small groups\nof cooperators, individuals signal to one another a willingness to\nconform to a simple rule: to refrain from the material goods others\ncome to possess by labor or good fortune, provided those others will\nobserve the same restraint toward them. (This rule will in time require\nmore detail: specific rules determining who may enjoy which goods\ninitially and how goods may be transferred.) This signalling is not a\npromise (which cannot occur without another, similar convention), but\nan expression of conditional intention. The usefulness of such a custom\nis so obvious that others will soon catch on and express a similar\nintention, and the rest will fall in line. The convention develops\ntacitly, as do conventions of language and money. When an individual\nwithin such a small society violates this rule, the others are aware of\nit and exclude the offender from their cooperative activities. Once the\nconvention is in place, justice (of this sort) is defined as conformity\nwith the convention, injustice as violation of it; indeed, the\nconvention defines property rights, ownership, financial obligation,\ntheft, and related concepts, which had no application before the\nconvention was introduced. So useful and obvious is this invention that\nhuman beings would not live for long in isolated family groups or in\nfluctuating larger groups with unstable possession of goods; their\ningenuity would quickly enable them to invent property, so as to reap\nthe substantial economic benefits of cooperation in larger groups in\nwhich there would be reliable possession of the product, and they would\nthus better satisfy their powerful natural greed by regulating it with\nrules of justice.\n\n\nGreed, and more broadly, self-interest, is the motive for inventing\nproperty; but we need a further explanation why we think of justice\n(adherence to the rules of ownership) as virtuous, and injustice (their\nviolation) as vicious. Hume accounts for the moralization of property\nas follows. As our society grows larger, we may cease to see our own\nproperty violations as a threat to the continued existence of a stable\neconomic community, and this reduces our incentive to conform. But\nwhen we consider violations by others, we partake by sympathy in the\nuneasiness these violations cause to their victims and all of society. Such\ndisinterested uneasiness, and the concomitant pleasure we feel on\ncontemplating the public benefits of adherence, are instances of moral\ndisapproval and approval. We extend these feelings to our own behavior as a\nresult of general rules. This process is \u201cforwarded by the\nartifice of politicians\u201d (T 3.2.2.25), who assist nature by\ncultivating widespread esteem for justice and abhorrence of injustice in order to\ngovern more easily. Private education assists in this further artifice.\nThus material honesty becomes a virtue.\n",
