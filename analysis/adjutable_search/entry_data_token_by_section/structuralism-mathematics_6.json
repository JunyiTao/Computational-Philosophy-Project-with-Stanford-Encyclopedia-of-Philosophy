    "main_text": "Category-Theoretic Structuralism || Category Theory as the Study of Mathematical Structures\n3.1 Category Theory as the Study of Mathematical Structures\n\nOver the past two decades, different proposals have been made to\nformulate a theory of mathematical structuralism based on category\ntheory, thus a theory, or theories, of \u201ccategorical\nstructuralism\u201d.  We are now in a better position to consider\nthese proposals, although we will still proceed indirectly, starting\nwith more background. Category theory was first introduced as a branch\nof abstract algebra in Eilenberg & Mac Lane\u2019s famous\narticle, \u201cGeneral Theory of Natural Equivalences\u201d\n(1945). It subsequently developed into an autonomous mathematical\ndiscipline, in work by Mac Lane, Grothendieck, Kan, Lawvere, and many\nothers, with important, wide-ranging applications in algebraic\ntopology and homological algebra and, more recently, in computer\nscience and logic (cf. Landry & Marquis 2005, also the\n entry on category theory\nin this encyclopedia).\n\nBuilding on these developments, the philosophical discussion of\ncategorical structuralism was initiated by Awodey, Landry, Marquis,\nand McLarty in the 1990s.  To understand their contributions better,\nit helps to go back to our distinction between\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d and \u201cmethodological\nstructuralism\u201d, which is drawn explicitly in Awodey (1996).  Or\nrather, Awodey distinguishes between the use of category theory as a\nframework for \u201cmathematical\u201d and for \u201cphilosophical\nstructuralism\u201d. He describes mathematical structuralism as a\ngeneral way of \u201cpursuing a structural approach to the\nsubject\u201c, i.e., a particular style of practicing mathematics\nthat employs structural concepts and methods.  He then argues that\ncategory theory provides the best way of capturing structural\nmathematics in this sense. However, he also presents it as a framework\nfor philosophical structuralism, i.e., \u201can approach to the\nontology and epistemology of mathematics\u201d.  Let us first\nconsider the former argument. (We will return to the latter in\n section 3.3).\n\nCategory theory, understood as a branch of pure mathematics, has\nfrequently been described as a \u201cgeneral theory of mathematical\nstructures\u201d, e.g., by Mac Lane (1986, 1996). But what exactly is\nmeant by \u201cstructure\u201d here?  At least two relevant notions\nare mentioned in the literature. First, a structure can be understood\nin the set- and model-theoretic sense, i.e., as a tuple consisting of\na domain and an ordered sequence of relations, functions, and\ndistinguished elements used for the interpretation of a formal\nlanguage. (This is the notion of \u201crelational system\u201d we\nappealed to above more informally.)  Such structures are often called\n\u201cBourbaki structures\u201d in this context. Their properties\nare usually defined axiomatically, e.g., by the group axioms or the\nDedekind-Peano axioms for arithmetic.\n\nSecond and alternatively, there is a categorical notion of structure\nbased on the primitive concept of morphisms between mathematical\nobjects. Typically, a category consists of two types of entities,\nnamely objects and morphisms between them, i.e., mappings represented\nby arrows that preserve some of the internal structural composition of\nthe objects. An axiom system that defines the general concept of a\ncategory, along such lines, was first introduced by Eilenberg and Mac\nLane (1945). It describes a suitable composition operation on arrows,\nits associativity, as well as the existence of an identity morphism\nfor each object (cf. Awodey 2010 for a textbook presentation of\ncategory theory).\n\nWhy might category theory be considered a more adequate framework for\na mathematical structuralism than other disciplines, in particular\ntraditional (Cantorian, Zermelo-Fraenkel) set theory? It is helpful to\nconsult Awodey (1996) on this issue. According to him, the Bourbaki\nnotion of structure is a direct result of the modern axiomatic\ntradition of Dedekind, Hilbert, and the Bourbaki group. This tradition\neventually led to a structuralist perspective on mathematics. Yet set\ntheory is not an ideal framework for capturing a structuralist\nunderstanding of mathematical objects. To begin with, set theory is\nclosely tied to a model-theoretic conception of mathematical theories,\nincluding the view that such theories study their models only\n\u201cup to isomorphism\u201d. But central to a structuralist point\nof view is the principle (more on which below) to \u201cidentify\nisomorphic objects\u201d; and this principle is well motivated from a\ncategory-theoretic viewpoint, but less so if mathematical objects are\nrepresented set-theoretically. \n\nA second advantage of category theory over set theory, also mentioned\nin Awodey (1996), is that the categorical notion of structure is\n\u201csyntax invariant\u201d.  That is to say, unlike in standard\nmodel theory the categorical specification of objects in terms of\ntheir mapping properties is independent of the choice of a particular\nsignature used for their description (a choice of basic relations,\nfunctions, and distinguished elements). Third and most importantly,\ncharacteristic for category theory is its focus on morphisms and\ntransformations between mathematical objects that preserve (some of)\ntheir internal structure. It is the emphasis on structure-preserving\nmappings in the specification of objects that is often viewed as a\ncentral feature of the structuralist turn in modern mathematics. As\nsuch, it was present in various parts of nineteenth- and early\ntwentieth-century mathematics, including Galois theory, Klein\u2019s\nErlangen program, Dedekind\u2019s foundational writings, as well as\nin work on abstract algebra by the Noether school (cf. again Reck\n& Schiemer forthcoming).\n\nCategory theory was first developed, against the background of these\ndevelopments, as a unifying framework for the study of the relations\nbetween different mathematical structures (cf.  Landry & Marquis\n2005, Marquis 2009). Different types of mappings were introduced for\nthis task. One type involves the morphisms between the objects of the\nsame category, e.g., group homomorphisms in the category of groups, or\nlinear maps in the category of vector spaces. Another important type\nof mappings are \u201cfunctors\u201d between different\ncategories. (Roughly, a functor between two categories is a mapping of\nobjects to objects and arrows to arrows that preserves the categorical\nproperties in question.) It is such functors that are the central\ntools in category-theory for comparing the objects of different\nmathematical categories, and thus, to \u201crelate structures of\ndifferent kinds\u201d (Awodey 1996).  As such, they are central to\ncategorical structuralism.\n",
