    "main_text": "Suggested Meaning and Speaker\u2019s Intention || Insufficiency of Existing Capacities\n3.1 Insufficiency of Existing Capacities\n\u0100nandavardhana proceeds by citing passages which are generally accepted to have various kinds of poetic effects, and then analyzing how these effects are attained by suggestion. He divides the content of what is suggested into implied meanings, implied figures, and aesthetic moods (rasa). He also distinguishes among varieties of suggested meaning according to other criteria such as the speaker\u2019s intention, how rapidly the hearer recovers the suggested content, and whether expressions or phonemes are the basis for what is suggested. When suggestion is a way of conveying the rasa, the dominant aesthetic mood described or intimated within a poem, it is called rasa-dhvani. \u0100nandavardhana tries to give an account of when it is that suggestion causes poetic beauty, and argues that rasa is the proper aim of all poetry. It is important to mark that, for \u0100nandavardhana, rasa is found within the text, and not the reader. The reader simply comes to have a cognition of the text\u2019s rasa. Thus it is easily understood as meaning, and not a reader\u2019s emotional state. After Abhinavagupta\u2019s commentary on \u0100nandavardhana, the emphasis shifts onto the reader\u2019s emotive experience, and how to understand rasa in relation to other kinds of meaning becomes more difficult. Even though many things may be suggested (figures of speech, facts), the ultimate aim of dhvani or suggestion in the poetic context is to suggest rasa.\nTake the case of \u201cThe village is on the Ganges.\u201d Here, \u0100nandavardhana argues that suggestion operates after both primary and secondary meaning. What is suggested is the purity of the village which is on the bank of the holy Ganges river. Note, though, that he does not think that both primary and secondary meaning are always necessary for suggestion. For instance, the word \u201cGanges\u201d itself could suggest purity without being in a metaphorical or otherwise figurative context (here, it is metonymical for the bank). \u0100nandavardhana also contrasts the function of suggestion with the primary meaning function. As for the latter, he says the relationship between the composition of words in a sentence and its primary meaning is a \u201cnatural relation.\u201d The sense in which the word\u2013referent relation is \u201cnatural\u201d is that it is fixed. A word\u2019s primary meaning is that meaning which is cognized in every single instance the word is employed. Suggestion, in contrast, is an \u201cartificial relation\u201d since it is a meaning that is not given by its natural word, and the relationship between suggested meaning and a suggestive word is not one\u2013to\u2013one.\nOn \u0100nandavardhana\u2019s view, the suggested meaning is a further step beyond the secondary meaning, but is not always understood through what is secondarily meant. For example, what is suggested in this case is understood through the primary meaning of \u201cGanges,\u201d since it is the river and not the bank which is associated with suggested properties (specified as its purity and coolness, according to later thinkers). The crucial aspect of \u0100nandavardhana\u2019s view is that while secondary meaning requires a failure of semantic fit, suggestion does not. A hearer\u2019s understanding of \u201con the Ganges\u201d as meaning \u201con the bank of the Ganges\u201d is necessary in order for the sentence not to cause a cognition of a village as floating upon the Ganges. In contrast, the suggested sense does not rectify any apparent semantic incompatibility in the literal meaning of the sentence.\n",
