    "main_text": "Knowledge\n3. Knowledge\n\nModern Confucian epistemic thought typically divides knowledge into\ntwo broad kinds: knowledge of the world or things and knowledge of\nmorality or the person. This is often discussed in terms from\nSong-Ming Confucianism, knowledge from seeing and hearing (jianwen\nzhi zhi \u898b\u805e\u4e4b\u77e5) and knowledge of the\nvirtuous nature (dexing zhi zhi\n\u5fb7\u6027\u4e4b\u77e5). Each of the philosophers examined\nhere approaches this distinction in a slightly different way, while\nsharing the insistence that morality and values cannot be approached\nobjectively and empirically, but are still realities that can be\nknown. They admired the achievements of science in increasing\nknowledge about the world, but held that science could not be the\nroute to understand morality (Ro\u0161ker 2016: 101). However, this\ndoes not mean there are no moral truths or that human beings cannot\ngrasp them: relativism or skepticism were never seriously entertained.\nIt means that moral knowledge has to be understood in a different way.\nA common philosophical problem is interpreting and defending the\nConfucian way of acquiring moral knowledge, especially the intuitive\napproach of Wang Yangming.\n\nXiong Shili established the basic distinction which Mou, Tang, and Xu\nfollowed. In Xiong\u2019s thought, wisdom (zhi \u667a) is\nthe cognition of fundamental reality, which he also identifies as the\ntrue mind. Discernment (hui \u6167) is cognition of mundane\nthings and what is ordinarily called knowledge. Wisdom is non-dual,\nwithout separation of self and other (Xiong 1932 [2015: 21\u201322]).\nHe also employed the terms \u201cderivative knowledge\u201d and\n\u201cdirect knowledge\u201d (Guo 2021: 100\u2013103). Throughout\nthe New Treatise, Xiong emphasizes the interdependence and\nunity of the mind and cognitive objects, and the importance of wisdom\nover discernment. Knowledge (discernment) is useful for navigating the\nworld of phenomena, but useless for understanding fundamental reality,\nwhich has to be sought within one\u2019s own mind (Xiong 1932 [2015:\n25\u201326]; Ng Yu-kwan 2003: 231; Tan 2009: 544). Treating it as an\nobject will get nowhere:\n\n\nThe absolute [quality] of principle does not belong to the realm of\nthe conceivable. It can be known only through internal\nself-realization. (Xiong 1932 [2015: 159])\n\n\nThis focus on the internal and knowing in a non-conceptual manner was\npicked up by each of his followers.\n",
