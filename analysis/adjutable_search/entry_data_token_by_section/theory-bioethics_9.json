    "main_text": "Bioethics and High Moral Theory || The Attractions of High Theory\n3.1 The Attractions of High Theory\n\nThe attractions of high theory were, and are, significant, and indeed,\nsuch moral theories have provided the groundwork for many an approach\nto bioethical issues. Examples here include Alan Donagan\u2019s\nKantian-inspired work on informed consent (Donagan 1977), Tristram\nEngelhardt\u2019s libertarian critique of redistribution in health\ncare (Engelhardt 1986 [1996]), and Joseph Fletcher\u2019s utilitarian\napproach to a broad range of issues in bioethics (Fletcher 1974).\n\nWhat might explain such recourse to high moral theory? What are the\nattractions of high moral theory for the bioethicist? Let us consider\nthree important possibilities. First, in bioethics as in everyday\nlife, our routine moral coping skills work often enough. When they do\nnot, though, we need recourse to more structured and systematic moral\nguidance. On these occasions, high moral theory, such as\nconsequentialism and deontology, looks helpful and attractive. Besides\noffering guidance, such theory provides the resources for moral\njustification, especially helpful when we are pressed to explain our\nbioethical or everyday moral decisions. Second, when we appeal to\nmid-level principles (such as the principle of justice or the\nprinciple of beneficence), we sometimes need help in weighing,\nbalancing, and adjudicating between those principles. High moral\ntheory could well provide such help, by providing a form of moral\nstandard. Recall Sidgwick\u2019s argument in support of\nutilitarianism, that it could provide guidance in resolving conflicts\namong ordinary duties that everyday (non-theoretical) moral thinking\ncannot resolve on its own (Sidgwick 1874). In a similar vein, Martha\nNussbaum defends the need for moral theory in part by emphasizing what\nshe takes to be its power in helping us weigh various rules against\neach other in varying circumstances through its setting of a normative\nstandard (Nussbaum 2000). Third, high moral theory can help us achieve\nconsistency in our moral lives, as well as a systematic perspective.\nThere is benefit, the thought goes, to bringing moral theory to bear\nupon various facets of our ordinary and bioethical lives, because of\nthe systematicity and coherence it can provide. Bernard Gert is one\nfor whom such systematization, at least within bioethics, takes\npriority (Gert, Culver, & Clauser 2006).\n",
