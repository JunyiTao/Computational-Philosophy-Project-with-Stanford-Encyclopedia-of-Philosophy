    "main_text": "Two Problems of Theoretical Terms || Theoretical Entities\n3.1 Theoretical Entities\n\nA proper semantics for theoretical terms involves an account of\nreference and one of meaning and understanding. Reference fixing needs\nto be related to meaning as we want to answer the following question:\nhow do we come to refer successfully to theoretical entities? This\nquestion calls for different answers depending on what particular\nconception of a theoretical entity is adopted. The issue of realism\nand its alternatives, therefore, comes into play at this point.\n\nFor the realist, theoretical entities exist independently of our\ntheories about the world. Also, natural kinds that classify these\nentities exist independently of our theories (cf. Psillos 1999; Lewis\n1984). The instrumentalist picture is commonly reported to account for\ntheoretical entities in terms of mere fictions. The formalist variant\nof instrumentalism denies that theoretical terms have referents in the\nfirst place. Between these two extreme cases there is a number of\nintermediate\n positions.[1]\n\nCarnap (1958; 1966: ch. 26) attempted to attain a metaphysically\nneutral position so as to avoid any commitment to or denial of\nscientific realism. In his account of the theoretical language of\nscience, theoretical entities were conceived of as mathematical\nentities that are related to observable events in certain determinate\nways. An electron, for example, figures as a certain distribution of\ncharge and mass in a four-dimensional manifold of real numbers, where\ncharge and mass are real-valued functions. These functions and the\nfour-dimensional manifold itself are to be related to observable\nevents by means of universal axioms. Notably, Carnap would not have\naccepted a characterization of his view as antirealist or non-realist\nsince he thought the metaphysical doctrine of realism to be void of\ncontent.\n\nThere thus are different metaphysical views of theoretical entities in\nscience, each of which is consistent with the understanding that a\ntheoretical entity is inaccessible by means of unaided perception.\nFirst, theoretical entities are mind and language independent. Second,\ntheoretical entities are mind and language dependent in some way or\nother. Third, they are conceived of as mathematical entities that are\nrelated to the observable world in certain determinate ways. We may\nthus distinguish between (i) a realist view, (ii) a collection of\nnon-realist views and (iii) a Pythagorean view of theoretical\nentities.\n\nNow, there are three major accounts of reference and meaning that have\nbeen used, implicitly or explicitly, for the semantics of theoretical\nterms: (i) the descriptivist picture, (ii) causal and\ncausal-historical theories and (iii) hybrid ones that combine\ndescriptivist ideas with causal elements (Reimer 2010). Accounts of\nreference and meaning other than these play no significant role in the\nphilosophy of science. Hence, we need to survey at least nine\ncombinations consisting, first, of an abstract characterization of the\nnature of a theoretical entity (realist, non-realist and Pythagorean),\nand, second, a particular account of reference (descriptivist, causal\nand hybrid). Some of these combinations are plainly inconsistent and,\nhence, can be dealt with very briefly. Let us start with the realist\nview of theoretical entities.\n3.1.1 The realist view\n\nThe descriptivist picture is highly intuitive with regard to our\nunderstanding of expressions referring to theoretical entities on the\nrealist view. According to this picture, an electron is a\nspatiotemporal entity with such and such a mass and such and such a\ncharge. We detect and recognize electrons when identifying entities\nhaving these properties. The descriptivist explanation of meaning and\nreference makes use of theoretical functions, mass and electric charge\nin the present example. The semantics of theoretical entities,\ntherefore, is connected with the semantics of theoretical relations\nand functions, which will be dealt with in the next subsection. It\nseems to hold, in general, that theoretical entities in the sciences\nare to be characterized in terms of theoretical functions and\nrelations.\n\nThe descriptivist account, however, faces two particular problems with\nregard to the historic evolution of scientific theories. First, if\ndescriptions of theoretical entities are constitutive of the meaning\nof corresponding unary predicates, one must wonder what the common\ncore of understanding is that adherents of successive theories share\nand whether there is such a core at all. Were Rutherford and Bohr\ntalking about the same type of entities when using the expression\n\u2018electron\u2019? Issues of incommensurability arise with the\ndescriptivist picture (Psillos 1999: 280). A second problem arises\nwhen elements of the description of an entity in a given theory\nT are judged wrong from the viewpoint of a successor theory\n\\(T'\\). Then, on a strict reading of the descriptivist account, the\ncorresponding theoretical term failed to refer in T. For if\nthere is nothing that satisfies a description, the corresponding\nexpression has no referent. This is a simple consequence of the theory\nof description by Russell in his famous \u201cOn Denoting\u201d\n(1905). Hence, an account of weighting descriptions is needed in order\nto circumvent such failures of reference.\n\nAs is well known, Kripke (1980) set forth a causal-historical account\nof reference as an alternative to the descriptivist picture. This\naccount begins with an initial baptism that introduces a name and goes\non with causal chains transmitting the reference of the name from\nspeaker to speaker. In this picture, Aristotle is the man once\nbaptized so; he might not have been the student of Plato or done any\nother thing commonly attributed to him. Kripke thought this picture to\napply both to proper names and general terms. It is hardly indicated,\nhowever, how this picture works for expressions referring to\ntheoretical entities (cf. Papineau 1996). Kripke\u2019s story is\nparticularly counterintuitive in view of the ahistorical manner of\nteaching in the natural sciences. There, up-to-date textbooks and\nrecent journal articles are more important than the original,\nhistorical introduction of a theoretical term. The Kripkean causal\nstory may also be read as an account of reference fixing without being\nread as a story of grasping the meaning of theoretical terms.\nReference, however, needs to be related to meaning so as to ensure\nthat scientists know what they are talking about and are able to\nidentify the entities under investigation. Notably, even for\nexpressions of everyday language, the charge of not explaining meaning\nhas been leveled against Krikpe\u2019s causal-historical account\n(Reimer 2010). The same charge applies to Putnam\u2019s (1975) causal\naccount of reference and meaning, which Putnam himself abandoned in\nhis (1980).\n\nA purely causal or causal-historical account of reference does not\nseem a viable option for theoretical terms. More promising are hybrid\naccounts that combine descriptivist intuitions with causal elements.\nSuch an account has been given by Psillos (1999: 296):\n\nA term t refers to an entity x if and\nonly if x satisfies the core causal description\nassociated with t.\nTwo terms \\(t'\\) and t denote the same entity if and only\nif (a) their putative referents play the same causal role with respect\nto a network of phenomena; and (b) the core causal description of\n\\(t'\\) takes up the kind-constitutive properties of the core causal\ndescription associated with t.\n\n\nThis account has two particular merits. First, it is much closer to\nthe way scientists understand and use theoretical terms than purely\ncausal accounts. Because of this, it is not only an account of\nreference but also one of meaning for theoretical terms. In purely\ncausal accounts, by contrast, there is a tendency to abandon the\nnotion of meaning altogether. Second, it promises to ensure a more\nstable notion of reference than in purely descriptivist accounts of\nreference and meaning. Notably, the kind of causation that\nPsillos\u2019s hybrid account refers to is different from the\ncausal-historical chains that Kripke thought responsible for the\ntransmission of reference among speakers. No further explanation,\nhowever, is given of what a kind-constitutive property is and how we\nare to recognize such a property. Psillos (1999: 288n) merely infers\nthe existence of such properties from the assumption of there being\nnatural kinds.\n3.1.2 Non-realist views\n\nNon-realist and antirealist semantics for theoretical terms are\nmotivated by the presumption that the problem of theoretical terms has\nno satisfying realist solution. What does a non-realist semantics of\ntheoretical terms look like? The view that theoretical entities are\nmere fictions often figures in realist portrays of antirealism. This\nview is hardly seriously maintained by any philosopher of science in\nthe twentieth century. If one were to devise a formal or informal\nsemantics for the view that theoretical entities are mere fictions, a\npurely descriptive account seems most promising. Such an account could\nin particular make heavy use of the Fregean notion of sense. For one\nimportant motivation for introducing this notion is to explain our\nunderstanding of expressions like \u2018Odysseus\u2019 and\n\u2018Pegasus\u2019.\n\nFormalist variants of instrumentalism are a more serious alternative\nto realist semantics than the fiction view of theoretical entities.\nFormalist views in the philosophy of mathematics aim to account for\nmathematical concepts and objects in terms of syntactic entities and\noperations thereupon within a calculus. Such views have been carried\nover to theoretical concepts and objects in the natural sciences, with\nthe qualification that the observational part of the calculus is\ninterpreted in such a way that its symbols refer to physical or\nphenomenal objects. Cognitive access to theoretical entities is thus\nexplained in terms of our cognitive access to the symbols and rules of\nthe calculus in the context of an antecedent understanding of the\nobservation terms. Formalist ideas were sympathetically entertained by\nHermann Weyl (1949). He was driven towards such ideas by adherence to\nHilbert\u2019s distinction between real and ideal elements and the\ncorresponding distinction between real and ideal propositions (Hilbert\n1926). Propositions of the observation language were construed as real\nin the sense of this Hilbertian distinction, while theoretical\npropositions are construed as ideal. The content of an ideal\nproposition is understood in terms of the (syntactic) consistency of\nthe whole system consisting of ideal and real propositions being\nasserted.\n3.1.3 The Pythagorean view\n\nThere remains to discuss the view that theoretical entities are\nmathematical entities which are related to observable events in\ncertain determinate ways. This theory is clearly of the descriptivist\ntype, as we shall see more clearly when dealing with the formal\naccount by Carnap in\n Section 4.\n No causal elements are needed in Carnap\u2019s Pythagorean\nempiricism.\n\nThe Pythagorean view shifts the problem of theoretical terms to the\ntheory of meaning and reference for mathematical expressions. The\nquestion of how we are able to refer successfully to electrons is\nanswered by the Pythagorean by pointing out that we are able to refer\nsuccessfully to mathematical entities. Moreover, the Pythagorean\nexplains, it is part of the notion of an electron that corresponding\nmathematical entities are connected to observable phenomena by means\nof axioms and inference rules. The empirical surplus of theoretical\nentities in comparison to \u201cpure\u201d mathematical entities is\nthus captured by axioms and inference rules that establish connections\nto empirical phenomena. Since mathematical entities do not, by\nthemselves, have connections to observable phenomena, the question of\ntruth and falsehood may not be put in a truth-conditional manner for\nthose axioms that connect mathematical entities with phenomenal events\n(cf.\n Section 4.2).\n Carnap (1958), therefore, came to speak of postulates when\nreferring to the axioms of a scientific theory.\n\nHow do we come to refer successfully to mathematical entities? This,\nof course, is a problem in the philosophy of mathematics. (For a\nclassical paper that addresses this problem see Benacerraf (1973)).\nCarnap has not much to say about meaning and reference of mathematical\nexpressions in his seminal \u201cThe Methodological Character of\nTheoretical Concepts\u201d (1956) but discusses these issues in his\n\u201cEmpiricism, Semantics, and Ontology\u201d (1950). There he\naims at establishing a metaphysically neutral position that avoids a\ncommitment to Platonist, nominalist or formalist conceptions of\nmathematical objects. A proponent of the Pythagorean view other than\nCarnap is Hermann Weyl (1949). As for the cognition of mathematical\nentities, Weyl largely followed Hilbert\u2019s formalism in his later\nwork. Hence, there is a non-empty intersection between the Pythagorean\nview and the formalist view of theoretical entities. Unlike Carnap,\nWeyl did not characterize the interpretation of theoretical terms by\nmeans of model-theoretic notions.\n3.2 Theoretical Functions and Relations\n\nFor theoretical functions and relations, a particular problem arises\nfrom the idea that a theoretical term is, by definition, semantically\ndependent upon a scientific theory. Let us recall the above\nexplanation of T-theoreticity: a term t is\nT-theoretical if and only if any method of determining the\nextension of t, or some part of that extension, rests upon\nsome axiom of T. Let \\(\\phi\\) be such an axiom and m\nbe a corresponding method of determination. The\npresent explanation of T-theoreticity, then, means that m\nis valid only on condition of \\(\\phi\\) being true.\nThe latter dependency holds because \\(\\phi\\) is used either explicitly\nin calculations to determine t or in the calibration of\nmeasurement devices. Such devices, then, perform the calculation\nimplicitly. A case in point is measurement of temperature by a gas\nthermometer. Such a device rests upon the law that changes of\ntemperature result in proportional changes in the volume of gases.\n\nSuppose now t is theoretical with respect to a theory\nT. Then it holds that in order to measure t, we need\nto assume the truth of some axiom \\(\\phi\\) of T. Suppose,\nfurther, that t has occurrences in \\(\\phi\\), as is standard\nin examples of T-theoreticity. From this it follows that, in\nstandard truth-conditional semantics, the truth value of \\(\\phi\\) is\ndependent on the semantic value of t. This leads to the\nfollowing epistemological problem: on the one hand, we need to know\nthe extension of t in order to find out whether \\(\\phi\\) is\ntrue. On the other hand, it is simply impossible to determine the\nextension of t without using \\(\\phi\\) or some other axiom of\nT. This mutual dependency between the semantic values of\n\\(\\phi\\) and t makes it difficult, if not even impossible, to\nhave evidence for \\(\\phi\\) being true in any of its applications (cf.\nAndreas 2008).\n\nWe could, of course, use an alternative measurement method of\nt, say one resting upon an axiom \\(\\psi\\) of T, to\ngain evidence for the axiom \\(\\phi\\) being true in some selected\ninstances. This move, however, only shifts the problem to applications\nof another axiom of T. For these applications the same type\nof difficulty arises, viz., mutual dependency of the semantic values\nof \\(\\psi\\) and t. We are thus caught either in a vicious\ncircle or in an infinite regress when attempting to gain evidence for\nthe propriety of a single measurement of a theoretical term. Sneed\n(1979: ch. II) was the first to describe that particular difficulty in\nthe present manner and termed it the problem of theoretical\nterms. Measurement of the force function in classical mechanics\nexemplifies this problem well. There is no method of measuring force\nthat does not rest upon some law of classical mechanics. Likewise, it\nis impossible to measure temperature without using some law that\ndepends upon either phenomenological or statistical\nthermodynamics.\n\nAlthough its formulation is primarily epistemological, Sneed\u2019s\nproblem of theoretical terms has a semantic reading. Let the meaning\nof a term be identified with the methods of determining its extension,\nas suggested in\n Section 1.2.\n Then we can say that our understanding of T-theoretical\nrelations and functions originates from the axioms of the scientific\ntheory T. In standard truth-conditional semantics, by\ncontrast, one assumes that the truth value of an axiom is determined\nby the semantic values of those descriptive symbols which have\noccurrences in \\(\\phi\\). Among these symbols, there are theoretical\nterms of T. Hence, it appears that standard truth-conditional\nsemantics does not accord with the order of our grasping the meaning\nof theoretical terms. In the next section, we will deal with indirect\nmeans of interpreting theoretical terms. These proved to be ways out\nof the present problem of theoretical terms.\n4. Formal Accounts\n\nA few notational conventions and preliminary considerations are\nnecessary to explain the formal accounts of theoretical terms.\nEssential to all of these accounts is the division of the set of\ndescriptive symbols into a set \\(V_o\\) of observational and another\nset \\(V_t\\) of theoretical terms. (The descriptive symbols of a formal\nlanguage are simply the non-logical ones.) A scientific theory thus be\nformulated in a language \\(L(V_o,V_t)\\). The division of the\ndescriptive vocabulary gives rise to a related distinction between\nT- and C-axioms among the axioms of a scientific\ntheory. The T-axioms contain only \\(V_t\\) symbols as\ndescriptive ones, while the C-axioms contain both \\(V_o\\) and\n\\(V_t\\) symbols. The latter axioms establish a connection between the\ntheoretical and the observational terms. TC designates the\nconjunction of T- and C-axioms and \\(A(\\TC)\\) the\nset of these axioms. Let \\(n_1 ,\\ldots ,n_k\\) be the elements of\n\\(V_o\\) and \\(t_1 ,\\ldots ,t_n\\) the elements of \\(V_t\\). Then,\nTC is a proposition of the following type: \n\n\\[\\tag{\\(\\TC\\)} \\TC(n_1 ,\\ldots ,n_k, t_1 ,\\ldots ,t_n).\\]\n\n\nRamsey ([1929] 1931) assumes that there is but one domain of\ninterpretation for all descriptive symbols. Carnap (1956, 1958), by\ncontrast, distinguishes between a domain of interpretation for\nobservational terms and another for theoretical terms. Notably, the\nlatter domain contains exclusively mathematical entities. Ketland\n(2004) has emphasized the importance of distinguishing between an\nobservational and a theoretical domain of interpretation. TC\nis a first-order sentence in Ramsey\u2019s seminal article\n\u201cTheories\u201d ([1929] 1931). Carnap (1956; 1958), however,\nworks with higher-order logic to allow for the formulation of\nmathematical propositions and concepts.\n4.1 The Ramsey Sentence \n\nThe Ramsey sentence of a theory TC in the language \\(L(V_o,V_t)\\) is obtained by the following two transformations of the conjunction of T- and C-axioms. First, replace all theoretical symbols in this conjunction by higher-order variables of appropriate type. Second, bind these variables by higher-order existential quantifiers. As result one obtains a higher-order sentence of the following form: \\[\\tag{\\(\\TC^R\\)} \\exists X_1 \\ldots \\exists X_n \\TC(n_1 , \\ldots ,n_k, X_1 , \\ldots ,X_n)\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(X_1 , \\ldots ,X_n\\) are higher-order variables. This sentence\nsays that there is an extensional interpretation of the theoretical\nterms that verifies, together with an antecedently given\ninterpretation of the observation language \\(L(V_o)\\), the axioms\nTC. The Ramsey sentence expresses an apparently weaker\nproposition than TC, at least in standard truth-conditional\nsemantics. If one thinks that the Ramsey sentence expresses the\nproposition of a scientific theory more properly than TC, one\nholds the Ramsey view of scientific theories.\n\nWhy should one prefer the Ramsey view to the standard one? Ramsey\n([1929] 1931: 231) himself seemed to have a contextual theory of\nmeaning in mind when proposing the replacement of theoretical terms\nwith appropriate higher-order variables:\n\n\nAny additions to the theory, whether in the form of new axioms or\nparticular assertions like \\(\\alpha(0, 3)\\) are to be made within the\nscope of the original \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\). They are not,\ntherefore, strictly propositions by themselves just as the different\nsentences in a story beginning \u2018Once upon a time\u2019 have not\ncomplete meanings and so are not propositions by themselves.\n\n\n\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) figure in this explanation as\ntheoretical terms to be replaced by higher-order variables. Ramsey\ngoes on to suggest that the meaning of a theoretical sentence \\(\\phi\\)\nis the difference between\n\n\\((\\TC \\wedge A \\wedge \\phi)^R\\)\n\n\nand\n\n\\((\\TC \\wedge A)^R\\)\n\n\nwhere A stands for the set of observation sentences\nbeing asserted and (...)\\(^R\\) for the operation of Ramsification,\ni.e., existentially generalizing on all theoretical terms. This\nproposal of expressing theoretical assertions clearly makes such\nassertions dependent upon the context of the theory TC.\nRamsey ([1929] 1931: 235n) thinks that a theoretical assertion\n\\(\\phi\\) is not meaningful if no observational evidence can be found\nfor either \\(\\phi\\) or its negation. In this case there is no stock\nA of observation sentences such that (1) and (2)\ndiffer in truth value.\n\nAnother important argument in favor of the Ramsey view was given later\nby Sneed (1979: ch. III). It is easy to show that Sneed\u2019s\nproblem of theoretical terms (which concerns relations and functions)\ndoes not arise in the first place on the Ramsey view. For \\(\\TC^R\\)\nonly says that there are extensions of the theoretical terms such that\neach axiom of the set \\(A(\\TC)\\) is satisfied in the context of a\ngiven interpretation of the observational language. No claim, however,\nis made by \\(\\TC^R\\) as to whether or not the sentences of \\(A(\\TC)\\)\nare true. Nonetheless, it can be shown that \\(\\TC^R\\) and TC\nhave the same observational consequences:\n\n\nProposition 1. For all \\(L(V_o)\\) sentences \\(\\phi\\),\n\\(\\TC^R\\) \\(\\vdash \\phi\\) if and only if \\(\\TC \\vdash \\phi\\), where\n\\(\\vdash\\) designates the relation of logical consequence in classical\nlogic.\n\n\nHence, the Ramsey sentence cannot be true in case the original theory\nTC is not consistent with the observable facts. For a\ndiscussion of empirical adequacy and Ramsification see Ketland\n(2004).\n\nOne difficulty, however, remains with the Ramsey view. It concerns the\nrepresentation of deductive reasoning, for many logicians the primary\nobjective of logic. Now, Ramsey ([1929] 1931: 232) thinks that the\n\u2018incompleteness\u2019 of theoretical assertions does not affect\nour reasoning. No formal account, however, is given that relates our\ndeductive practice, in which abundant use of theoretical terms is\nmade, to the existentially quantified variables in the Ramsey\nsentence. We lack a translation of theoretical sentences (other than\nthe axioms) that is in keeping with the view that the meaning of a\ntheoretical sentence \\(\\phi\\) is the difference between \\((\\TC \\wedge\nA \\wedge \\phi)^R\\) and \\((\\TC \\wedge A)^R\\). As Ramsey observes, it\nwould not be correct to take \\((\\TC \\wedge A \\wedge \\phi)^R\\) as\ntranslation of a theoretical sentence \\(\\phi\\) since both \\((\\TC\n\\wedge A \\wedge \\phi)^R\\) and \\((\\TC \\wedge A \\wedge \\neg \\phi)^R\\)\nmay well be true. Such a translation would not obey the laws of\nclassical logic. These laws, however, are supposed to govern deductive\nreasoning in science. A proper semantics of theoretical terms should\ntake the semantic peculiarities of these terms into account without\nrevising the rules of deductive reasoning in classical logic.\n\nThere thus remains the challenge of relating the apparent use of\ntheoretical terms in deductive scientific reasoning to the Ramsey\nformulation of scientific theories. Carnap was well aware of this\nchallenge and addressed it using a sentence that became labeled later\non the Carnap sentence of a scientific theory (Carnap 1958;\n1966: ch. 23): \n\n\\[ \\tag{\\(A_T\\)} \\TC^R \\rightarrow \\TC.\\]\n\n\nThis sentence is part of a proposal to draw the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction at the global level of a scientific theory (as this\ndistinction proved not to be applicable to single axioms): the\nanalytic part of the theory is given by its Carnap sentence \\(A_T\\),\nwhereas the synthetic part is identified with the theory\u2019s\nRamsey sentence in light of Proposition 1. Carnap (1958) wants \\(A_T\\)\nto be understood as follows: if the Ramsey sentence is true, then the\ntheoretical terms be interpreted such that TC comes out true\nas well. So, on condition of \\(\\TC^R\\) being true, we can recover the\noriginal formulation of the theory in which the theoretical terms\noccur as constants. For, obviously, TC is derivable from\n\\(\\TC^R\\) and \\(A_T\\) using Modus Ponens.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of standard truth-conditional semantics, however,\nthis instruction to interpret the Carnap sentence appears arbitrary,\nif not even misguided. For in standard semantics, the Ramsey sentence\nmay well be true without TC being so (cf. Ketland 2004).\nHence, the Carnap sentence would not count as analytic, as Carnap\nintended. Carnap\u2019s interpretation of \\(A_T\\) receives a sound\nfoundation in his (1961) proposal to define theoretical terms using\nHilbert\u2019s epsilon operator, as we shall see in\n Section 4.3.\n4.2 Indirect Interpretation\n\nThe notion of an indirect interpretation was introduced by Carnap in\nhis Foundations of Logic and Mathematics (1939: ch.\n23\u201324) with the intention of accounting for the semantics of\ntheoretical terms in physics. It goes without saying that this notion\nis understood against the background of the notion of a direct\ninterpretation. Carnap had the following distinction in mind. The\ninterpretation of a descriptive symbol is direct if and only if (i) it\nis given by an assignment of an extension or an intension, and (ii)\nthis assignment is made by expressions of the metalanguage. The\ninterpretation of a descriptive symbol is indirect, by contrast, if\nand only if it is specified by one or several sentences of the object\nlanguage, which then figure as axioms in the respective calculus. Here\nare two simple examples of a direct interpretation:\n\n\n\u2018R\u2019 designates the property of being\nrational.\n\n\u2018A\u2019 designates the property of being an\nanimal.\n\n\nThe predicate \u2018H\u2019, by contrast, is interpreted in\nan indirect manner by a definition in the object language:\n\n\\[\\forall x(Hx \\leftrightarrow Rx \\wedge Ax).\\]\n\n\nInterpretation of a symbol by a definition counts as one type of\nindirect interpretation. Another type is the interpretation of\ntheoretical terms by the axioms of a scientific theory. Carnap (1939:\n65) remains content with a merely syntactic explanation of indirect\ninterpretation:\n\n\nThe calculus is first constructed floating in the air, so to speak;\nthe construction begins at the top and then adds lower and lower\nlevels. Finally, by the semantical rules, the lowest level is anchored\nat the solid ground of the observable facts. The laws, whether general\nor special, are not directly interpreted, but only the singular\nsentences.\n\n\nThe laws \\(A(\\TC)\\) are thus simply adopted as axioms in the calculus\nwithout assuming any prior interpretation or reference to the world\nfor theoretical terms. (A sentence \\(\\phi\\) being an axiom of a\ncalculus C means that \\(\\phi\\) can be used in any formal\nderivation in C without being a member of the premises.) This\naccount amounts to a formalist understanding of the theoretical\nlanguage in science. It has two particular merits. First, it\ncircumvents Sneed\u2019s problem of theoretical terms since the\naxioms are not required to be true in the interpretation of the\nrespective language that represents the facts of the\ntheory-independent world. The need for assuming such an interpretation\nis simply denied. Second, the account is in line with the contextual\ntheory meaning for theoretical terms as our understanding of such\nterms is explained in terms of the axioms of the respective scientific\ntheories (cf.\n Section 1.2).\n\nThere are less formalist accounts of indirect interpretation in terms\nof explicit model-theoretic notions by Przelecki (1969: ch. 6) and\nAndreas\n (2010).[2]\n The latter account is based on ideas about theoretical terms in\nCarnap (1958). It emerged from an investigation into the similarities\nand dissimilarities between Carnapian postulates and definitions.\nRecall that Carnap viewed the axioms of a scientific theory as\npostulates since they contribute to the interpretation of theoretical\nterms. When explaining the Carnap sentence \\(\\TC^R \\rightarrow \\TC\\),\nCarnap says that, if the Ramsey sentence is true, the theoretical\nterms are to be understood in accordance with some interpretation that\nsatisfies TC. This is the sense in which we can say that\nCarnapian postulates contribute to the interpretation of theoretical\nterms in a manner akin to the interpretation of a defined term by the\ncorresponding definition. Postulates and definitions alike impose a\nconstraint on the admissible, or intended, interpretation of the\ncomplete language \\(L(V)\\), where V contains basic\nand indirectly interpreted terms.\n\nYet, the interpretation of theoretical terms by axioms of a scientific\ntheory differs in several ways from that of a defined term by a\ndefinition. First, the introduction of theoretical terms may be joined\nwith the introduction of another, theoretical domain of\ninterpretation, in addition to the basic domain of interpretation in\nwhich observation terms are interpreted. Second, it must not be\nassumed that the interpretation of theoretical terms results in a\nunique determination of the extension of these terms. This is an\nimplication of Carnap\u2019s doctrine of partial interpretation\n(1958), as will become obvious by the end of this section. Third,\naxioms of a scientific theory are not conservative extensions of the\nobservation language since they enable us to make predictions.\nDefinitions, by contrast, must be conservative (cf. Gupta 2009).\nTaking these differences into account when observing the semantic\nsimilarities between definitions and Carnapian postulates suggests the\nfollowing explanation: a set \\(A(\\TC)\\) of axioms that interprets a\nset \\(V_t\\) of theoretical terms on the basis of a language \\(L(V_o)\\)\nimposes a constraint on the admissible, or intended, interpretations\nof the language \\(L(V_o,V_t)\\). An \\(L(V_o,V_t)\\) structure is\nadmissible if and only if it (i) satisfies the axioms\n\\(A(\\TC)\\) and (ii) extends the intended interpretation of \\(L(V_o)\\)\nto include an interpretation of the theoretical terms.\n\nIn more formal terms (Andreas 2010: 373; Przelecki 1969: ch. 6):\n\n\nDefinition 3 (Set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) of admissible\nstructures)\n\nLet \\(\\mathcal{A}_o\\) designate the intended interpretation of the\nobservation language. Further, \\(\\MOD(A(\\TC))\\) designates the set of\n\\(L(V_o,V_t)\\) structures that satisfy the axioms \\(A(\\TC)\\).\n\\(\\EXT(\\mathcal{A}_o,V_t,D_t)\\) is the set of \\(L(V_o,V_t)\\)\nstructures that extend \\(\\mathcal{A}_o\\) to interpret the theoretical\nterms, where the domain of interpretation may be extended by a domain\n\\(D_t\\) of theoretical entities.\n\n\\(\\mathcal{S} := \\MOD(A(\\TC)) \\cap \\EXT(\\mathcal{A}_o,V_t,D_t)\\)\nif \\(\\MOD(A(\\TC)) \\cap \\EXT(\\mathcal{A}_o,V_t,D_t) \\ne\n\\varnothing\\);\n\\(\\mathcal{S} := \\EXT(\\mathcal{A}_o,V_t,D_t)\\) if \\(\\MOD(A(\\TC))\n\\cap \\EXT(\\mathcal{A}_o,V_t,D_t) = \\varnothing\\).\n\n\n\nGiven there is a range of admissible, i.e., intended structures, the\nfollowing semantic rules for theoretical sentences suggest\nthemselves:\n\n\nDefinition 4 (Semantics of theoretical sentences)\n\n\\(\\nu : L(V_o,V_t) \\rightarrow \\{T, F, I\\}.\\)\n\n\\(\\nu(\\phi) := T\\) if and only if for all structures \\(\\mathcal{A}\n\\in \\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A} \\vDash \\phi\\);\n\\(\\nu(\\phi) := F\\) if and only if for all structures \\(\\mathcal{A}\n\\in \\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A} \\not\\vDash \\phi\\);\n\\(\\nu(\\phi) := I\\) (indeterminate) if and only if there are\nstructures \\(\\mathcal{A}_1, \\mathcal{A}_2 \\in \\mathcal{S}\\) such that\n\\(\\mathcal{A}_1 \\vDash \\phi\\) but not \\(\\mathcal{A}_2 \\vDash\n\\phi\\).\n\n\n\nThese semantic rules are motivated by supervaluation logic (van\nFraassen 1969; Priest 2001: ch. 7). A sentence is true if and only if\nit is true in every admissible structure. It is false, by contrast, if\nand only if it is false in every admissible structure. And a sentence\ndoes not have a determinate truth value if and only if it is true in,\nat least, one admissible structure and false in, at least, another\nstructure that is also admissible.\n\nA few properties of the present semantics are noteworthy. First, it\naccounts for Carnap\u2019s idea that the axioms \\(A(\\TC)\\) have a\ntwofold function, viz., setting forth empirical claims and determining\nthe meaning of theoretical terms (Carnap 1958). For, on the one hand,\nthe truth values of the axioms \\(A(\\TC)\\) depend on empirical,\nobservable facts. These axioms, on the other hand, determine the\nadmissible interpretations of the theoretical terms. These two\nseemingly contradictory properties are combined by allowing the axioms\n\\(A(\\TC)\\) to interpret theoretical terms only on condition of there\nbeing a structure that both extends the given interpretation of the\nobservation language and that satisfies these axioms. If there is no\nsuch structure, the theoretical terms remain uninterpreted. This\nsemantics, therefore, can be seen to formally work out the old\ncontextual theory of meaning for theoretical terms.\n\nSecond, Sneed\u2019s problem of theoretical terms\n (Section 3.2)\n does not arise in the present semantics since the formulation of this\nproblem is bound to standard truth-conditional semantics. Third, it is\nclosely related to the Ramsey view of scientific theories as the\nfollowing biconditional holds:\n\n\nProposition 2  \\(\\TC^R\\) if and only if for all\n\\(\\phi \\in A(\\TC), \\nu(\\phi) = T\\).\n\n\nUnlike the Ramsey account, however, the semantics of indirect\ninterpretation does not dispense with theoretical terms. It can rather\nbe shown that allowing for a range of admissible interpretations as\nopposed to a single interpretation does not affect the validity of\nstandard deductive reasoning (Andreas 2010). Hence, a distinctive\nmerit of the indirect interpretation semantics of theoretical terms is\nthat theoretical terms need not be recovered from the Ramsey sentence\nin the first place.\n\nThe label partial interpretation is more common in the\nliterature to describe Carnap\u2019s view that theoretical terms are\ninterpreted by the axioms or postulates of a scientific theory (Suppe\n1974: 86\u201395). The partial character of interpretation is\nretained in the present account since there is a range of admissible\ninterpretations of the complete language \\(L(V_o,V_t)\\). This allows\nfor the interpretation of theoretical terms to be strengthened by\nfurther postulates, just as Carnap demanded in his 1958 and 1961. To\nstrengthen the interpretation of theoretical terms is to further\nconstrain the range of admissible interpretations of\n\\(L(V_o,V_t)\\).\n\nWhat happens if the axioms A(TC) are inconsistent or fail to be\nempirically adequate? In other words, what happens if there is no\ninterpretation of the theoretical terms such that this interpretation\nsatisfies all the axioms and agrees with the antecedent interpretation\nof the observation terms? In this case, the axioms of the respective\ntheory fail to interpret the theoretical terms. The set of admissible\nstructures, as defined by Definition 3, is empty. At the same time, we\nthink we have some understanding of the theoretical terms, even if the\nrespective theory fails to be fully consistent with the empirical\ndata. For example, we think we have some understanding of the\ntheretical terms in classical mechanics, even though classical\nmechanics is not universally applicable. Moreover, we seem to have\ninconsistent, yet non-trivial scientific theories, such as classical\nelectrodynamics.\n\nConsequently, Andreas (2018) generalized the present semantics so as\nto capture scientific reasoning in a paraconsistent setting. The\nproposal is based on a preferred-models semantics: satisfaction of a\ntheory and agreement with empirical data comes in degrees. Some\ninterpretations score better than others. This idea leads to a strict\npartial order of interpretations. And we understand the theoretical\nterms in such a manner that the set of instances of all the axioms is\nsatisfied to a maximal extent in the context of a given interpretation\nof the observation terms. This proposal parallels certain adaptive\nlogics, developed by Batens (2000) and Meheus et al. (2016). Notably,\nit allows us to capture scientific reasoning with ceteris paribus\nlaws, i.e., laws that hold true most of the time but have exceptions.\nThis could be helpful for the analysis of theoretical terms in\nscientific disciplines other than physics.\n\nRelatively little research has been done on the semantics of\ntheoretical terms in theories from scientific disciplines other than\nphysics. It has remained an open question whether or not formal\nsemantics that were primarily developed to capture theories in physics\nare applicable to theories in biology, chemistry, psychology,\neconomics, etc. For the structuralist framework by Balzer et al.\n(1987) it could be shown that such applications are feasible (see\nBalzer et al. 2000). Rakover (2020) and McClimans (2017) studied\ntheoretical terms in psychology, albeit without explicit\nconsiderations of their formal semantics.\n4.3 Direct Interpretation\n\nBoth the Ramsey view and the indirect interpretation semantics deviate\nfrom standard truth-conditional semantics at the level of theoretical\nterms and theoretical sentences. Such a deviation, however, was not\nfelt to be necessary by all philosophers that have worked on\ntheoretical concepts. Tuomela (1973: ch. V) defends a position that he\ncalls semantic realism and that retains standard\ntruth-conditional semantics. Hence, direct interpretation is assumed\nfor theoretical terms by Tuomela. Yet, semantic realism for\ntheoretical terms acknowledges there to be an epistemological\ndistinction between observational and theoretical terms.\nTuomela\u2019s (1973: ch. I) criterion of the theory-observation\ndistinction largely coincides with Sneed\u2019s above expounded\ncriterion. Since direct interpretation of theoretical terms amounts\njust to standard realist truth conditions, there is no need for a\nfurther discussion here.\n4.4 Defining Theoretical Terms\n\nIn Weyl (1949), Carnap (1958), Feyerabend (1962) and a number of other\nwritings, we find different formulations of the idea that the axioms\nof a scientific theory determine the meaning of theoretical terms\nwithout these axioms qualifying as proper definitions of theoretical\nterms. Lewis, however, wrote a paper with the title \u201cHow to\nDefine Theoretical Terms\u201d (1970). A closer look at the\nliterature reveals that the very idea of explicitly defining\ntheoretical terms goes back to Carnap\u2019s (1961) use of\nHilbert\u2019s epsilon operator in scientific theories. This operator\nis an indefinite description operator that was introduced by Hilbert\nto designate some object x that satisfies an open\nformula \\(\\phi\\). So \n\n\\[\\varepsilon x \\phi(x)\\]\n\n\ndesignates some x satisfying \\(\\phi(x)\\), where x\nis the only free variable of \\(\\phi\\) (cf. Avigad and\nZach 2002). Now, Carnap (1961: 161n) explicitly defines theoretical\nterms in two steps: \n\n\\[\\tag{\\(A_{T(0)}\\)} \\bar{t} = \\varepsilon \\bar{X} \\TC(\\bar{X}, n_1 ,\\ldots ,n_k)\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\bar{X}\\)is a sequence of higher-order variables and\n\\(\\bar{t}\\) a corresponding instantiation. So, \\(\\bar{t}\\) designates\nsome sequence of relations and functions that satisfies TC in\nthe context of an antecedently given interpretation of \\(V_o\\). Once\nsuch a sequence has been defined via the epsilon-operator, the second\nstep of the definition is straightforward: \n\n\\[ \\tag{\\(A_{T(i)}\\)} t_i = \\varepsilon x (\\exists u_1 \\ldots \\exists u_n (\\bar{t} = \\langle u_1 ,\\ldots ,u_n\\rangle \\wedge x = u_i)).\\]\n\n\nCarnap showed that these definitions imply the Carnap sentence\n\\(A_T\\). Hence, they allow for direct recovery of the theoretical\nterms for the purpose of deductive reasoning on condition of the\nRamsey sentence being true.\n\nLewis (1970) introduced a number of modifications concerning both the\nlanguage of the Carnap sentence and its interpretation in order to\nattain proper definitions of theoretical terms. First, theoretical\nterms are considered to refer to individuals as opposed to relations\nand functions. This move is made coherent by allowing the basic\nlanguage \\(L(V_o)\\) to contain relations like \u2018x\nhas property y\u2019. The basic,\ni.e., non-theoretical language is thus no observation language in this\naccount. Yet, it serves as the basis for introducing theoretical\nterms. The set \\(V_o\\) of \u2018O-terms\u2019 is best described as\nour antecedently understood vocabulary.\n\nSecond, denotationless terms are dealt with along the lines of free\nlogic by Dana Scott (1967). An improper description, for example,\ndenotes nothing in the domain of discourse. Atomic sentences\ncontaining denotationless terms are either true or false. An identity\nstatement that contains a denotationless term on both sides is always\ntrue. If just one side of an identity formula has an occurrence of a\ndenotationless term, this identity statement is false.\n\nThird, Lewis (1970) insists on a unique interpretation of theoretical\nterms, thus rejecting Carnap\u2019s doctrine of partial\ninterpretation. Carnap (1961) is most explicit about the indeterminacy\nthat this doctrine implies. This indeterminacy of theoretical terms\ndrives Carnap to using Hilbert\u2019s \\(\\varepsilon\\)-operator there,\nas just explained. For Lewis, by contrast, a theoretical term is\ndenotationless if its interpretation is not uniquely determined by the\nRamsey sentence. For a scientific theory to be true, it must have a\nunique interpretation.\n\nUsing these modifications, Lewis transforms the Carnap sentence into\nthree Carnap-Lewis postulates, so to speak: \n\n\\[ \\begin{align*} \\tag{CL1} \\exists y_1 &\\ldots \\exists y_n \\forall x_1 \\ldots \\forall x_n \\\\ &(\\TC(n_1 ,\\ldots ,n_k, x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n) \\leftrightarrow y_1 = x_1 \\wedge \\ldots \\wedge y_n = x_n) \\rightarrow \\\\ & \\TC(n_1 ,\\ldots ,n_k, t_1 ,\\ldots ,t_k) \\\\ &\\\\ \\tag{CL2} \\,\\,\\neg \\exists x_1 &\\ldots \\exists x_n \\TC(n_1 ,\\ldots ,n_k, x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n) \\rightarrow \\\\ & \\neg \\exists x(x = t_1) \\wedge \\ldots \\wedge \\neg \\exists x(x = t_n) \\\\ &\\\\ \\tag{CL3} \\exists x_1 &\\ldots \\exists x_n \\TC(n_1 ,\\ldots ,n_k, x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n) \\wedge \\mathord{}\\\\ &\\neg \\exists y_1 \\ldots \\exists y_n \\forall x_1 \\ldots \\forall x_n \\\\ & (\\TC(n_1 ,\\ldots ,n_k, x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n) \\leftrightarrow y_1 = x_1 \\wedge \\ldots \\wedge y_n = x_n) \\rightarrow \\\\ &\\neg \\exists x(x = t_1) \\wedge \\ldots \\wedge \\neg \\exists x(x=t_n). \\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nThese postulates look more difficult than they actually are. CL1 says\nthat, if TC has a unique realization, then it is realized by\nthe entities named by \\(t_1,\\ldots,t_k\\). Realization of a theory\nTC, in this formulation, means interpretation of the\ndescriptive terms under which TC comes out true, where the\ninterpretation of the \\(V_o\\) terms is antecedently given. So, CL1 is\nto be read as saying that the theoretical terms are to be understood\nas designating those entities that uniquely realize TC, in\nthe context of an antecedently given interpretation of the \\(V_o\\)\nterms. CL2 says that, if the Ramsey sentence is false, the theoretical\nterms do not designate anything. To see this, recall that \\(\\neg\n\\exists x(x=t_i)\\) means, in free logic, that \\(t_i\\) is\ndenotationless. In case the theory TC has multiple\nrealizations, the theoretical terms are denotationless too. This is\nexpressed by CL3.\n\nCL1\u2013CL3 are equivalent, in free logic, to a set of sentences\nthat properly define the theoretical terms \\(t_i (1 \\le i \\le\nn)\\): \n\n\\[ \\begin{align} \\tag{\\(D_i\\)} t_i = \\iota y_i \\exists y_1 &\\ldots \\exists y_{i-1} \\exists y_{i+1}\\ldots \\exists y_n \\forall x_1 \\ldots \\forall x_n \\\\ &(\\TC(n_1 , \\ldots ,n_k, x_1 , \\ldots ,x_n) \\leftrightarrow \\\\ & y_1 = x_1 \\wedge \\ldots \\wedge y_i = x_i \\wedge \\ldots \\wedge y_n = x_n). \\end{align} \\]\n\n\n\\(t_i\\) designates, according to this definition schema, the\ni-th component in that sequence of entities that uniquely\nrealizes TC. If there is no such sequence, \\(t_i (1 \\le i \\le\nn)\\) is denotationless. But even if a theoretical term \\(t_i\\) fails\nto have a denotation, the definition \\(D_i\\) of this term remains true\nas long as the complete language \\(L(V_o,V_t)\\) is interpreted in\naccordance with the postulates CL1\u2013CL3, thanks to the use of\nfree logic.\n\nA few further properties of Lewis\u2019s definitions of theoretical\nterms are noteworthy. First, they specify the interpretation of\ntheoretical terms uniquely. This property is obvious for the case of\nunique realization of TC but holds as well for the other\ncases since assignment of no denotation counts as interpretation of a\ndescriptive symbol in free logic. Second, it can be shown that these\ndefinitions do not allow for the derivation of any \\(L(V_o)\\)\nsentences except logical truths, just as the original Carnap sentence\ndid. Lewis, therefore, in fact succeeds in defining\ntheoretical terms. He does so without attempting to divide the axioms\n\\(A(\\TC)\\) into definitions and synthetic claims about the\nspatiotemporal world.\n\nThe replacement of theoretical relation and function symbols with\nindividual terms was judged counterintuitive by Papineau (1996). A\nreformulation, however, of Lewis\u2019s definitions using second- or\nhigher-order variables is not difficult to accomplish, as Schurz\n(2005) has shown. In this reformulation the problem arises that\ntheoretical terms are usually not uniquely interpreted since our\nobservational evidence is most of the time insufficient to determine\nthe extension of theoretical relation and function symbols completely.\nTheoretical functions, such as temperature, pressure, electromagnetic\nforce etc., are determined only for objects that have been subjected\nto appropriate measurements, however indirect. In view of this\nproblem, Schurz (2005) suggests letting the higher-order quantifiers\nrange only over those extensions that correspond to natural\nkind properties. This restriction renders the requirement of\nunique interpretation of theoretical terms plausible once again. Such\na reading was also suggested by Psillos (1999: ch. 3) with reference\nto Lewis\u2019s (1984) discussion of Putnam\u2019s (1980)\nmodel-theoretic argument. In that paper, Lewis himself suggests the\nrestriction of the interpretation of descriptive symbols to extensions\ncorresponding to natural kind properties.\n\nOne final note on indirect interpretation is in order. Both Carnap\n(1961) and Lewis (1970) interpret theoretical terms indirectly simply\nbecause any definition is an instance of an indirect interpretation.\nFor this reason, Sneed\u2019s problem of theoretical terms\n (Section 3.2)\n does not arise. Yet, the pattern of Carnap\u2019s and Lewis\u2019s\nproposals conforms to the pattern of a definition in the narrow sense\nand not to the peculiar pattern of indirect interpretation that Carnap\n(1939) envisioned for the interpretation of theoretical terms. This is\nwhy the indirect interpretation semantics has been separated from the\npresent discussion of defining theoretical terms.\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe idea that there are scientific terms whose meaning is determined\nby a scientific theory goes back to Duhem and Poincar\u00e9. Such\nterms came to be referred to as theoretical terms in\ntwentieth century philosophy of science. Properties and entities that\nare observable in the sense of direct, unaided perception did not seem\nto depend on scientific theories as forces, electrons and nucleotides\ndid. Hence, philosophers of science and logicians set out to\ninvestigate the semantics of theoretical terms. Various formal\naccounts resulted from these investigations, among which the Ramsey\nsentence by Ramsey ([1929] 1931), Carnap\u2019s notion of indirect\ninterpretation (1939; 1958) and Lewis\u2019s (1970) proposal of\ndefining theoretical terms are the most prominent ones. Though not all\nphilosophers of science understand the notion of a theoretical term in\nsuch way that semantic dependence upon a scientific theory is\nessential, this view prevails in the literature.\n\nThe theory-observation distinction has been attacked heavily and is\npresumably discredited by a large number of philosophers of science.\nStill, this distinction continues to permeate a number of important\nstrands in the philosophy of science, such as scientific realism and\nits alternatives and the logical analysis of scientific theories. A\ncase in point is the recent interest in the Ramsey account of\nscientific theories which emerged in the wake of Worral\u2019s\nstructural realism (cf. Ladyman 2009). We have seen, moreover, that\nthe formal accounts of theoretical terms work well with a\ntheory-observation distinction that is relativized to a particular\ntheory. Critics of that distinction, by contrast, have commonly\nattacked a global and static division into theoretical and\nobservational terms (Maxwell 1962; Achinstein 1965). Note finally that\nCarnap assigned no ontological significance to the theory-observation\ndistinction in the sense that entities of the one type would be\nexistent in a more genuine way than ones of the other.",
