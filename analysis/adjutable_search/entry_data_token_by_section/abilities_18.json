Abilities and the free will debates\n\nThus far our questions about abilities have been formal ones: we have\nbeen asking what it is to have an ability without concerning ourselves\nwith the substantive work that a theory of ability might have to do.\nBut there is much work to be had for a theory of ability: abilities\nhave figured as unexplained explainers in a range of philosophical\ntheories, for example in accounts of concepts (Millikan 2000), of\nknowledge (Greco 2009, Sosa 2007), and of \u2018knowing what it\u2019s\nlike\u2019 (Lewis 1988). Perhaps the most prominent substantive role\nfor a theory of ability\u00a0has been the uses to which accounts of\nability have been put in the free will debates. So let us close with a\nbrief survey of what work a theory of ability might be expected to do\nin those debates.\n\nQuestions about abilities have figured most prominently in debates\nover compatibilism. \u2018Compatibilism\u2019 is used in many ways,\nbut let us understand it here as the thesis that the ability to\nperform actions one does not perform is compossible with the truth of\ndeterminism, which we may take to be the view that the facts about the\npast and the laws jointly determine the facts about the present and\nall future moments. (We should sharply distinguish this view, which we\nmight call classical compatibilism, from more recent views\nsuch as the \u2018semi-compatibilism\u2019 of Fischer and Ravizza\n1998). Insofar as compatibilism, so understood, has been explicitly\ndefended, these defenses have made appeal to theories of ability,\nnotably the conditional analysis and its variants, as well as the\ndispositionalist analysis favored by the new dispositionalists.\n\nIn the discussion of the conditional analysis, we distinguished\nbetween global and local counterexamples to\nhypothetical theories of ability, where the former appealed to the\nfact that any such theory would render ability compatible with\ndeterminism which, according to the objector, it is not. There we\nnoted the dialectical limitations of such counterexamples, namely the\ncontentiousness of their main premise. But compatibilists have often\nbeen guilty of what seems to be the opposite mistake. Namely, they\nhave offered theories of ability which show abilities to be compatible\nwith determinism, and have argued from this to the claim that\nsuch abilities are indeed compatible with determinism.\n\nThe shortcomings of this strategy are nicely diagnosed by Peter van\nInwagen. After surveying the local counterexamples that arise for\nvarious hypothetical theories of ability, van Inwagen imagines that we\nhave arrived at the best possible hypothetical theory of ability,\nwhich he labels \u2018the Analysis\u2019. van Inwagen then\nwrites:\n\nWhat does the Analysis do for us? How does it affect our understanding\nof the Compatibility Problem? It does very little for us, so far as I\ncan see, unless we have some reason to think it is correct.\nMany compatibilists seem to think that they need only present a\nconditional analysis of ability, defend it against, or modify it in\nthe face of, such counter-examples as may arise, and that they have\nthereby done what is necessary to defend compatibilism. That is not\nhow I see it. The particular analysis of ability that a compatibilist\npresents is, as I see it, simply one of his premisses; his central\npremiss, in fact. And premisses need to be defended. (van Inwagen\n1983, 121)\n\n\nvan Inwagen\u2019s point is that, provided the incompatibilist has\noffered arguments for the claim that such abilities are\nincompatible with determinism\u2014as, in van Inwagen\u2019s\npresentation, the incompatibilist has\u2014the production of an\nanalysis is as yet no answer to those arguments. For those arguments\nare also arguments, inter alia, against the\ncompatibilist\u2019s favored account of ability.\n\nThere are, then, several obstacles for the compatibilist who wishes to\nappeal to an account of ability in defense of compatibilism. First,\nthere is the general difficulty of actually giving an extensionally\nadequate theory of ability. In addition, we have now turned up a\ncouple of more specific challenges to the compatibilist. There is van\nInwagen\u2019s point just outlined, namely that arguments for the\nincompatibility of abilities and determinism are, inter alia,\narguments against any theory of ability that is congenial to the\ncompatibilist. And, finally, there is the point that we encountered in\nour discussion of the new dispositionalism in Section 5.1, which is\nthat certain platitudes about ability \u2014 in particular, those\ninvolved in certain judgments about moral responsibility \u2014 may\nbe recalcitrant to compatibilist treatments. Taken together, these\npoints seem to pose a serious obstacle to any theory of ability that\nis both compatible with determinism and in accord with our ordinary\njudgments about what ability requires.\n\nWhat is the compatibilist to say in light of these obstacles? One\nresponse is to make a distinction between two kinds of compatibilist\nproject. (Compare Pryor 2000 on responses to skepticism). One project\nis to convince someone moved by the incompatibilist\u2019s\narguments to retreat from her position. Call this ambitious\ncompatibilism. For precisely the reasons van Inwagen gives, it is\ndoubtful that any theory of ability will suffice for a defense of\nambitious compatibilism. There is another project, however, that the\ncompatibilist might be engaging in. Let us say that, for some reason\nor other, she herself is not convinced by the incompatibilist\u2019s\nargument. She is still left with an explanatory burden, namely to\nexplain, if only to her own satisfaction, how it could\nbe that abilities are compatible with the truth of determinism.\nHere the compatibilist\u2019s aim is not to convince the\nincompatibilist of the error of her ways, but simply to work out a\nsatisfactory conception of compatibilism. Let us call this\nmodest compatibilism. This distinction is not often made, and\nit is not always clear which of these projects classical\ncompatibilists are engaged in. If the latter project is indeed part of\nclassical compatibilism, then we may grant many of the above points\nwhile still granting the theory of ability a central place in defenses\nof compatibilism. For it may be that, though a theory of ability is of\nno use to the ambitious compatibilist, it has a crucial role to play\nin the defense of modest compatibilism.\n\nEven these compatibilist aspirations, however, may be overly\noptimistic, or at least premature. For in surveying theories of\nability we have turned up serious difficulties, for both hypothetical\nand non-hypothetical approaches, which do not appear to turn on issues\nabout determinism. So it may be that the best hope for progress is to\npursue theories of ability while setting to one side the problems\nraised in the free will debates. For given the difficulties posed by\nabilities, and given the significance of theories of ability for areas\nof philosophy quite removed from the free will debates, there is\nsomething to be said for pursuing a theory of ability while embracing,\nif only temporarily, a certain quietism about the puzzles that\ndeterminism may pose.\n",
