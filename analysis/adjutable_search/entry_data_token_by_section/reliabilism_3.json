Challenges and Replies\n\nBy now, a number of problems have been raised for process reliabilism.\nHere we review some of the main challenges, focusing on the three that\nhave received the most attention in the literature: the clairvoyance\nproblem\n (\u00a72.1),\n the new evil demon problem\n (\u00a72.2),\n and the generality problem\n (\u00a72.3).\n Afterwards, we will briefly survey some challenges of a more recent\nvintage\n (\u00a72.4).\n",
