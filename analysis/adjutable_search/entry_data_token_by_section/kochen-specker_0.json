    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nQM has the peculiar property that quantum-mechanical states imply, in\ngeneral, only statistical restrictions on the results of\nmeasurements.  The natural conclusion to be drawn is that these\nstates are incomplete descriptions of quantum systems. QM, thus,\nwould be incomplete in the sense that a typical QM state description\nof an individual system could be supplemented with a more complete\ndescription in terms of an HV theory. In an HV description of the\nsystem the QM probabilities would be naturally interpreted as\nepistemic probabilities of the sort that arise in ordinary\nstatistical mechanics. Such an HV description might not be\npractically useful, but one is tempted to think that it should at\nleast be possible in principle. There are, however, two powerful\ntheorems to the effect that such a description is subject to severe \nconstraints: QM, given certain at least prima facie plausible premises, \ncannot be supplemented by an HV theory. The more famous of these two \ntheorems is Bell\u2019s theorem which states that, given a premise of\nlocality, an HV model cannot match the statistical predictions of\nQM. The second important no-go theorem against HV theories is the\ntheorem of Kochen and Specker (KS) which states that, given a premise\nof noncontextuality (to be explained presently) certain sets of QM\nobservables cannot consistently be assigned values at all (even\nbefore the question of their statistical distributions arises).\n\n\nBefore seeing the workings of the KS theorem in some detail, we must\nclarify why it is of importance to philosophers of science. The\nexplicit premise of HV interpretations, as understood throughout\nbelow, is one of value\ndefiniteness:\n(VD) All observables defined for a QM system have definite\nvalues at all times.\n\n\n(Note that for \nBohmian Mechanics\n often viewed as an HV interpretation of QM, this statement would have \nto be qualified.)\n[1]\nVD is motivated by an apparently innocuous assumption about\nexperimental results, which is reflected in the custom of referring to\nquantum experiments as \"measurements,\" namely, that these experiments\nreveal vales that exist independently of being measured. (Note that we\ndo not need to assume here that the values are faithfully revealed by\nmeasurement, but only that they exist!) This suggest a second,\nseemingly innocuous assumption, that of noncontextuality:\n(NC) If a QM system possesses a property (value of an\nobservable), then it does so independently of any measurement\ncontext, i.e. independently of how that value is eventually\nmeasured.\n\n\nWhen applied to specific properties that can be measured in different\nincompatible measurements, NC says that these properties are the same\nin these different measurement situations.\n\nNow, suppose we adopt the usual association of properties of a quantum\nsystem, that is, yes-no observables, and projection operators on the\nsystem\u2019s Hilbert space.\n(O) There is a one-one correspondence between properties\nof a quantum system and projection operators on the system\u2019s Hilbert\nspace\n\nThe KS theorem establishes a contradiction between VD + NC + O  and QM;\nthus, acceptance of QM logically forces us to renounce either VD or\nNC or O.\n\nIf a HV theory satisfying these conditions were feasible, we would\nhave a natural explanation of the statistical character of QM, and an\nelegant way of resolving the infamous measurement problem haunting all\ninterpreters of QM (see the entry on\n quantum mechanics\n and the section on the measurement problem in the entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory\n for details). What the KS theorem shows is that a HV theory of the most\n straightforward sort, satisfying these conditions, is not an option.  \nThe HV program is left with  only options that violate one or more of\n these conditions; see entries on\n Bohmian mechanics and\n modal interpretations of quantum mechanics.\n",
