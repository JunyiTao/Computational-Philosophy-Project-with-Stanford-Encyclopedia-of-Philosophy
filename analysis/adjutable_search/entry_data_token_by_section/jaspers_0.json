    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nKarl Theodor Jaspers was born on 23rd February 1883 in the\nNorth German town of Oldenburg near the North Sea, where his ancestors\nhad lived for generations. He was the son of a banker and a\nrepresentative of the parliament (Landtagesabgeordneten), Carl Wilhelm\nJaspers (1850\u20131940) and Henriette Tantzen (1862\u20131941), who\nalso came from a family that was involved in local parliament.\nJaspers\u2019s family milieu was strongly influenced by the political\nculture of North German liberalism, and he often referred to the\nclimate of early liberal democratic thought as a formative aspect of\nhis education. Moreover, although he claimed not to have been\ninfluenced by any specifically ecclesiastical faith, his thought was\nalso formed by the spirit of North German Protestantism, and his\nphilosophical outlook can in many respects be placed in the\nreligiously inflected tradition of Kant and Kierkegaard.\n\nJaspers was a pupil at the Altes Gymnasium in Oldenburg.\nSince his early childhood, Jaspers suffered from chronic\nbronchiectasis that impaired his physical capabilities and awareness\nof his physical disabilities shaped his routine throughout his adult\nlife and formed his sensitivity to psychological issues, including\nhuman suffering. Jaspers attributed his ability to conduct a normative\nroutine and to devote his life to his creative work to his strict\ndiscipline regarding his health.\n\nIn 1910 he married Gertrud Mayer (1879\u20131974), who came from a\npious German-Jewish merchant family. At the time, she was working as\nan assistant in the sanatorium of the neurologist and psychiatrist\nOskar Kohnstamms (1871\u20131917) and was the sister of his close\nfriends Gustav Mayer and the philosopher Ernest Mayer. Only thanks to\nher marriage to the already known philosopher Karl Jaspers was Gertrud\nMayer able to stay in Germany during the Nazi period.\n",
