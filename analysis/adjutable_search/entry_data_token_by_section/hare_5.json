    "main_text": "Possible People\n6. Possible People\n\n\nOutside Moral Thinking itself, a striking application of\nHare\u2019s framework was to possible people, that is, to people who may\nexist, with preferences and interests to be satisfied, if we choose to\nbring them into existence. Ought we to do so, so long as this will\nincrease the total satisfaction of preference? A positive answer has\nimplications\u2014though not, Hare argued, very radical\nones\u2014for population policy, and the morality of such practices\nas abortion and IVF. Hare reasons that, if I am glad that I exist, I\ntenselessly prescribe, ceteris paribus, that my parents bring\nme into existence; universalizing the prescription, I must\nprescribe, ceteris paribus, the bringing into existence of\nothers relevantly like me (1975, 1988b, 1988c).\n\n\nThis is intriguing, though not unproblematic. We may be struck by its\ninvocation, in effect, of past imperatives (such as Gerald Manley\nHopkins\u2019s \u201cHave fair fallen, O fair, fair have\nfallen\u201d, addressed to Henry Purcell, which Hopkins explained, in\na letter to Bridges on Feb. 3 1883, as \u2018the singular imperative\n(or optative if you like) of the past, a thing possible and actual\nboth in logic and grammar, but naturally a rare one\u2019). Not that\nthis is new: Hare had had already to defend them in prescriptivist\nanalysis of \u201cI ought to have done that\u201d. A further\nquestion is whether Hare has correctly isolated the initial\nattitude. If what I am glad of is the kind of life I experience, in\npreference to there simply being less life of this kind in the world\n(cf. 1988c: 173\u20134), then, if universalization generates a\ngolden-rule argument, it should indeed lead me to\nprescribe, ceteris paribus, creating other similar lives\n(unless it is the uniqueness of the life that I value).  But Hare also\nsupposes that what Jane Doe is grateful for is that she, Jane\nDoe, exist and not someone else, even equally privileged, in her place\n(1988b: 87\u20138). Yet it is less clear that we can expect her to\nhave that attitude, let alone its analogue, within Hare\u2019s\nframework, of being specially glad that Dick Hare (or someone with all\nhis universal qualities) exists\u2014supposing that he is glad to\nexist\u2014in that possible world in which she is (or has all the\nuniversal qualities of) Dick Hare.\n",
