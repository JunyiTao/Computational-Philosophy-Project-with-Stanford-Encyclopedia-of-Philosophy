    "main_text": "Teachings || Metaphysics\n2.3 Metaphysics\n\nAlthough metaphysics cannot surpass the limits of human knowledge,\nMarsilius considered it to be the entry point to theology. Natural\nreason is capable of forming some adequate and true concepts of God,\nand also of forming true propositions about God. It is able to prove\nthat God exists and possesses knowledge and will. But it cannot\ndemonstrate that God has free will or infinite power. This, Marsilius\nclaimed, was also true for philosophers such as Aristotle, whose\nteachings equal those of natural reason\n itself.[23]\n\nFrom Buridan, Marsilius took the idea that God according to Aristotle\nand Averroes is not only the final cause of the heavens and separate\nsubstances, but also their efficient cause. On this point Buridan and\nMarsilius were following the view of Scotus and Ockham against that of\nJohn of Jandun, Johannes Baconis, and Gregory of Rimini. It is worth\nnoting in this connection that in the Puncta super libros\nMetaphysicae (i.e., brief abstracts of Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics for teaching purposes) attributed to Johannes de\nSlupcza and written in Krakow in 1433, some of the views that\nMarsilius adopted from Buridan, including the one just mentioned, are\nattributed to Marsilius instead of Buridan \u2014 notwithstanding the\nfact that the author was familiar with both Marsilius\u2019s and\nBuridan\u2019s commentaries. This illustrates the strong influence\nMarsilius\u2019s work exerted on fifteenth-century students and\n commentators.[24]\n\nOn other points, however, Marsilius was critical of Buridan. For\nexample, Marsilius considered Buridan\u2019s solution to the problem\nof the possible separation of accidents from their substance as not in\naccordance with the teachings of Aristotle, and therefore not truly\nmetaphysical (metaphysicaliter), but rather in line with\ntheological concerns. Only miraculously could God take over the\nsupporting power of the substance, thus separating the accident from\nits natural bearer. According to Marsilius, however, such possible\ndivine intervention should not be taken into account in metaphysics,\nwhere the philosopher must use natural reason\n alone.[25]\n\nMarsilius was the first rector of the University of Heidelberg.\nAccording to the oldest Statutes of the Arts Faculty of this\nuniversity, every master must inform the students that whenever\nAristotle contradicts faith, e.g. in his claim that the world is\neternal, he is following natural reason and although his arguments in\nthese cases are wrong and faith must be accepted, natural reason\ncannot help but follow Aristotle and therefore cannot prove the\nconclusions of\n faith.[26]\n This paragraph clearly echos Marsilius\u2019s view on the issue.\nOther contemporary universities, like that of Vienna, were less\nrigorous and prescribed a more harmonious procedure, stipulating that\nwhenever there was a conflict with faith, the masters had to argue in\nfavor of faith against Aristotle to the best of their\n possibilities.[27]\n",
