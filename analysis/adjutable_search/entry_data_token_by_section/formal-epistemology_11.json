    "main_text": "Third Case Study: The Regress Problem || Foundationalism\n3.2 Foundationalism\n\nFoundationalists hold that some beliefs are justified without being\njustified by other beliefs. Which beliefs have this special,\nfoundational status? Foundationalists usually identify either beliefs\nabout perceived or remembered matters, like \u201cthere\u2019s a\ndoor in front of me\u201d or \u201cI had eggs yesterday\u201d, or\nelse beliefs about how things seem to us, like \u201cthere appears to\nbe a door in front of me\u201d or \u201cI seem to remember having\neggs yesterday\u201d. Either way, the challenge is to say how these\nbeliefs can be justified if they are not justified by any other\nbeliefs.\n\nOne view is that these beliefs are justified by our perceptual and\nmemorial states. When it looks like there\u2019s a door in front of\nme, this perceptual state justifies me in believing that there is a\ndoor there, provided I have no reason to distrust this appearance. Or,\nat least, I am justified in believing that there appears to\nbe a door there. So foundational beliefs are not arbitrary, they are\njustified by closely related perceptual and memorial states. Still,\nthe regress ends there, because it makes no sense to ask what\njustifies a state of perception or memory. These states are outside\nthe domain of epistemic normativity.\n\nA classic criticism of foundationalism now arises, a version of the\ninfamous\n Sellarsian dilemma.\n Must you know that your (say) vision is reliable to be justified in\nbelieving that there\u2019s a door in front of you on the basis of\nits looking that way? If so, we face the first horn of the dilemma:\nthe regress of justification is revived. For what justifies your\nbelief that your vision is reliable? Appealing to previous cases where\nyour vision proved reliable just pushes things back a step, since the\nsame problem now arises for the reliability of your memory. Could we\nsay instead that the appearance of a door is enough by itself to\njustify your belief in the door? Then we face the second horn: such a\nbelief would seem to be arbitrary, formed on the basis of a source you\nhave no reason to trust, namely your vision (Sellars 1956; Bonjour\n1985; Cohen 2002).\n\nThis second horn is sharpened by White (2006), who formalizes it in\nprobabilistic terms. Let \\(A(D)\\) be the proposition that there\nappears to be a door before you, and \\(D\\) the proposition that there\nreally is a door there. The conjunction \\(A(D) \\wedge \\neg D\\)\nrepresents the possibility that appearances are misleading in this\ncase. It says there appears to be a door but isn\u2019t really. Using\nthe probability axioms, we can prove that \\(p(D\\mid A(D)) \\leq p(\\neg\n(A(D) \\wedge \\neg D))\\) (see\n technical supplement \u00a73).\n In other words, the probability that there really is a door given\nthat there appears to be one cannot exceed the initial probability\nthat appearances are not misleading in this case. So it seems that any\njustification \\(A(D)\\) lends to belief in \\(D\\) must be preceded by\nsome justification for believing that appearances are not misleading,\ni.e., \\(\\neg (A(D) \\wedge \\neg D)\\). Apparently then, you must know\n(or have reason to believe) your sources are reliable before you can\ntrust them. (Pryor 2013 elucidates some tacit assumptions in this\nargument.)\n\nLying in wait at the other horn of the Sellarsian dilemma is the\nPrinciple of Indifference (PoI). What is the initial probability that\nthe appearance as of a door is misleading, according to the PoI? On\none way of thinking about it, your vision can be anywhere from 100%\nreliable to 0% reliable. That is, the way things appear to us might be\naccurate all the time, none of the time, or anywhere in between. If we\nregard every degree of reliability from 0% to 100% as equally\nprobable, the effect is the same as if we just assumed experience to\nbe 50% reliable. The PoI will then assign \\(p(D\\mid A(D))=1/2\\). This\nresult effectively embraces skepticism, since we remain agnostic about\nthe presence of the door despite appearances.\n\nWe saw earlier\n (\u00a72.1)\n that the PoI assigns different probabilities depending on how we\ndivide up the space of possibilities. What if we divide things up this\nway instead:\n\n\n\n\\(D\\)\n\\(\\neg D\\) \n\n\\(A(D)\\)\n\\(1/4\\)\n\\(1/4\\) \n\n\\(\\neg A(D)\\)\n\\(1/4\\)\n\\(1/4\\) \n\n\nOnce again, we get the skeptical, agnostic result that \\(p(D\\mid\nA(D))=1/2\\). Other ways of dividing up the space of possibilities will\nsurely deliver better, anti-skeptical results. But then some argument\nfor preferring those ways of dividing things up will be wanted,\nlaunching the regress of justification all over again.\n\nSubjectivists, who reject the PoI and allow any assignment of initial\nprobabilities as long as it obeys the probability axioms, may respond\nthat it\u2019s perfectly permissible to assign a high initial\nprobability to the hypothesis that our senses are (say) 95% reliable.\nBut they must also admit that it is permissible to assign a high\ninitial probability to the hypothesis that our senses are 0% reliable,\ni.e., wrong all the time. Subjectivists can say that belief in the\nexternal world is justified, but they must allow that skepticism is\njustified too. Some foundationalists may be able to live with this\nresult, but many seek to understand how experience justifies external\nworld beliefs in a stronger sense\u2014in a way that can be used to\ncombat skeptics, rather than merely agreeing to disagree with\nthem.\n",
