    "main_text": "Slurs, Code Words, and Dogwhistles || Slurs\n3.1 Slurs\n\nPerhaps the type of expression most often cited as the paradigm case\nof hate speech is slurs. Slurs are typically characterized as a type\nof insult that targets race, gender, sexual orientation, nationality,\nability, politics, immigrant status, geographic region, and other\ncategories. Much of the literature on slurs focuses primarily on the\nsemantic and pragmatic properties of this linguistic class, with the\nexpectation that such analyses also provide an account of how they in\nfact derogate their targets. There are, of course, competing accounts,\nsome of which may be better suited than others for the purposes of\nlegal and ordinary concepts of hate speech.\n\nBefore delving into competing accounts, it is good to put a working\ndefinition of \u2018slur\u2019 on the table. Typically, slurs are\nunderstood as conventionalized ways of demeaning and derogating\nindividuals or groups of individuals and are contrasted with a\nco-referring neutral counterpart (Jeshion, 2013a; 2013b; Camp, 2013;\nCepollaro, 2015). For instance, the following differ in regard to\noffense but are otherwise taken to make similar claims,\n\n(3.1)\nCrackers make up about 80% of Congress.\n(3.2)\nWhite people make up about 80% of Congress.\n\n\nFor many, (3.1) is regarded as offensive whereas (3.2) is simply a\ndescriptive statement. The expression \u2018cracker\u2019 in (3.1)\nis a slur, while \u2018white people\u2019 in (3.2) is its purported\nneutral counterpart.\n\nThough there seems to be widespread consensus that slurs have or could\nhave neutral counterparts, not everyone shares this sentiment. Lauren\nAshwell (2016), for example, denies that neutral counterparts (which\nshe refers to as \u2018neutral correlates\u2019) play an essential\nrole in identifying slurs. Ashwell claims that gendered slurs like\n\u2018bitch,\u2019 \u2018slut,\u2019 and \u2018sissy\u2019\nderogate in ways similar to racial and ethnic slurs like\n\u2018n***er,\u2019 \u2018k*ke,\u2019 \u2018cracker,\u2019 and\n\u2018sp*c,\u2019 yet lack neutral counterparts. As a result, a\ndefinition need not include reference to neutral counterparts. In\nfact, making neutral counterparts central to defining slurs renders\none incapable of accounting for terms that function similarly to slurs\nyet lack this purportedly central feature.\n\nAshwell makes a compelling case for the claim that gendered slurs lack\nneutral counterparts. Her larger claim that counterparts\u2019\ninessentiality for defining slurs has implications for pragmatic and\nsemantic accounts that are also worth taking seriously. According to\nAshwell, both sorts of accounts depend on the existence of neutral\ncounterparts in their explanations of slurs.\n\nExisting pragmatic accounts of slurs\u2019 derogating capabilities\nare in particular trouble, for they tend to hold that a slur\u2019s\nsemantic contribution to a sentence is identical to the contribution\nthat its neutral correlate would have had if it were used instead.\nThis kind of account also leaves open the possibility that the slur\ncould be sanitized\u2014cleansed of its derogatory\naspect\u2014without semantic meaning change. \u2026 Existing\nsemantic accounts, however, are not much better off\u2014they are\nalso structured to require the existence of a neutral correlate.\n(2016, 229)\n\n\nFor Ashwell, pragmatic and semantic accounts of slurs structurally\nrequire neutral counterparts, and so simply cannot jettison them.\nOne response proponents of these kinds of accounts could give is that\nthe gendered insults Ashwell highlights might exhibit properties that\ncall their status as slurs into question. It could be open to these\ntheorists to suggest that the terms they have identified as a matter\nof fact do carry neutral counterparts, that this is part of what\ndistinguishes them as a class. And while the expressions Ashwell\nidentifies seem to pattern in some ways like slurs, they also exhibit\nfeatures that make them dissimilar. Thus, there is no need to wedge\nall insulting expressions into one class; there is room to expand our\nclassifications in a way that preserves clarity.\n\nAnother important issue about slurs is their power to offend. Part of\nwhat makes them prime candidates for paradigmatic instances of hate\nspeech is a widespread belief in their offensive potency. Indeed, much\nof the literature on slurs simply assumes they are offensive without\noffering much (if any) defense of that claim. It is not always clear\nwhether the reader is supposed to understand offense as the\nprovocation of a disliked mental state or as the violation of\nwidely-accepted public norms.\n\nRen\u00e9e Bolinger (2017) discusses three ways to understand the\nclaim that slurs are offensive:\n\nAn audience actually took offense at a slurring utterance;\nThe utterance warranted offense;\nWhether or not offense was warranted, it was rational for the\naudience to take offense.\n\n\nThe sense of \u2018offense\u2019 in (1) tracks how audiences\nactually respond at the moment of utterance. This could not be the\nsense in which offense is understood for at least two reasons. First,\ndoing so would make the claim \u2018slurs are offensive\u2019 too\nstrong. Since we would be tracking cases of actual offense, we would\nbe focusing on particular uses of slurs, explaining what\nmakes those utterances offensive rather than explicating the\noffensiveness of a linguistic class. As a result, the most natural\ninterpretation of the claim would be that slurring utterances are\ninvariably offensive, i.e., the use of slurs always provokes disliked\nmental states.\n\nThis, of course, raises a couple of questions. To begin with, does the\nstrong claim deny the existence of non-offensive slur uses? Given\nthings like linguistic reappropriation, some instances of indirect\nreports, and even instances of direct reports\u2014especially by\nmembers of the slur\u2019s targeted group\u2014in which it is\npossible to utter slurs without provoking a disliked mental state in\nthe speaker\u2019s audience, the claim is obviously false. Further,\nthere are also questions about who constitutes the audience.\nIs the relevant audience the one intended by the speaker? Everyone who\nwitnesses the utterance? Only those who are present in the utterance\nsituation? Because the claim must now be understood to be about\nparticular slur utterances rather than the linguistic type, the claim\nmust reflect the diversity of reactions provoked by different\ntokenings of slurs. A second reason is related to the questions about\nthe audience: does everyone in the audience have to be offended, or is\nit sufficient if one, some, or a few are? What is the scope of the\nclaim with respect to offended reactions? The answers to these\nquestions will likely render the strong version of the claim untenable\nand weaker versions suspect. Thus, it is probably not the sense of\n\u2018offense\u2019 one should start with.\n\nThe sense expressed in (2) concerns moral justification for taking\noffense. Bolinger identifies three grounds for warranted offense at an\nutterance: intention, inappropriateness, and associations. A speaker\nmay intend to offend, often doing so with expressions that are taboo,\nand thus considered inappropriate. Vulgar expletives like\n\u2018fuck,\u2019 \u2018dick,\u2019 or \u2018shithead\u2019 are\ntypically viewed as inappropriate terms, at least in certain\n\u201cpolite\u201d settings. Some expressions, like slurs, are not\nonly inappropriate, but also carry associated attitudes and/or\npractices that amplify their offense. The swastika and confederate\nflag, for example, are both deeply associated with oppressive and\ngenocidal practices towards Jewish people and African Americans,\nrespectively.\n\nThis sense of offense still concerns one\u2019s response to\nsomething, though it is not simply about how one reacts but\none\u2019s warrant to do so: \u201cAn utterance may warrant, but\nfail to actually generate offense merely because either there is no\nhearer, or the hearer fails to find the utterance offensive (perhaps\nbecause she shares the offensive attitude, fails to take it seriously,\nor misinterprets the utterance)\u201d (Bolinger, 2017, 441). Bolinger\nnotes that the associational offense category in particular is the one\nthat is often the subject of hate crime legislation (ibid., 442). Such\nterms are often backed by formal social institutions,\n\u201cadequately visible practices,\u201d or a combination of\nboth.\n\nIn (3), Bolinger uses \u2018rational\u2019 or \u2018license\u2019\nto refer to the epistemic justification an audience has in\ntaking offense at a slurring utterance. Here a gap opens up between\nwhat an audience member may be warranted in taking offense at as\nopposed to when it may be rational to do so. For instance, if a\nnon-native speaker used a slur to refer to someone and we come to find\nout they were ignorant of the expression\u2019s status as a slur, the\ntarget would still have been rational to take offense even if\nunwarranted. Undoubtedly, any of the three senses discussed may factor\ninto an explanation of a given slur\u2019s offense. However, theories\nof slurs are more appropriately aimed at capturing warranted and\nrational offense.\n\nConsider again the following pair of statements:\n\n(3.1)\nCrackers make up about 80% of Congress.\n(3.2)\nWhite people make up about 80% of Congress.\n\n\nThe most straightforward explanation of the difference between (3.1)\nand (3.2) is that \u2018cracker\u2019 differs in some\nsemantic respect from \u2018white people\u2019. Two of the\nmost well-known versions of this approach are from Chris Hom (2008)\nand Elisabeth Camp (2013). On Hom\u2019s account,\n\u2018cracker\u2019 as opposed to \u2018white people,\u2019\ncontains derogatory content. Slurs\u2019 derogatory content is\ndetermined by the social institutions that undergird them, which\nconsists of two components: an ideology and a set of\npractices. Hom defines an ideology as \u201ca set of (usually)\nnegative beliefs about a particular group of people\u201d (431). As\nfor the set of practices, these are racist practices that \u201ccan\nrange from impolite social treatment to genocide\u201d (ibid.). The\ntwo components combine to produce slurs\u2019 semantic content, which\ncontains a normative claim about the way individuals ought to be\ntreated, because of possessing certain characteristics in virtue of\nbeing a member of an identifiable social group. (For alternative\naccounts of the relationship between slurs and ideology, see Kukla\n(2018) and Swanson (2015, Other Internet Resources).)\n\nThe pair of sentences in the example used here is illustrative of an\nobservation many will have noticed when considering different\nexamples. The slur in (3.1) is typically experienced as less offensive\nthan ones that target members of marginalized groups. Language users\nrecognize variation in offensive potency among slurs, some being more\noffensive than others. Hom refers to this as derogatory\nvariation. Difference in the virulence of those backing racist\ninstitutions explains variation in offense on Hom\u2019s account.\nThus, \u2018cracker\u2019 is less offensive than slurs like\n\u2018n***er,\u2019 \u2018sp*c,\u2019 and \u2018f*g\u2019\nbecause the racist and homophobic institutions backing them are much\nmore virulent. (One might also wonder if there is any racist\ninstitution backing slurs for members of dominant groups at all.)\n\nOne objection raised against Hom\u2019s view is that the semantic\ncontent he proposes of slurs is overwrought (Jeshion, 2013b). Robin\nJeshion argues that Hom\u2019s view \u201cattributes highly specific\nsets of ideologies and modes of treating the group, yet it is doubtful\nthat anything so semantically rich and well defined is semantically\nencoded in the slur\u201d (318). That is, it is doubtful the racist\nmeans anything this racialized. Jeshion denies that slurs\nexpress anything as robust as Hom claims.\n\nCamp offers an alternative semantic account in which slurs bear a\nclose relationship to a perspective, which are\n\u201copen-ended ways of thinking, feeling, and more generally\nengaging with the world and certain parts thereof\u201d (2013,\n335\u2013336). According to Camp, a speaker\u2019s slur use\n\u201csignals a commitment to an overarching perspective on the\ntargeted group as a whole\u201d (ibid., 337). The perspective is a\nnegative one that highlights certain characteristics or properties\nspecifically associated with particular groups, ones that are presumed\nto warrant certain affective and evaluative responses.\n\nWhat makes slurring perspectives a semantic feature for Camp is that\nthey do not \u201cmerely signal \u2026 allegiance to a certain\nperspective,\u201d but do so \u201cin an overt and nondefeasible\nway, precisely in virtue of employing that expression\u201d (ibid.,\n340). The use of a slur inserts a willful and noncancelable way of\nthinking about the target into a conversation. This is codified in the\nexpression itself, and not something audiences \u201cfigure\nout\u201d through the use of pragmatic mechanisms. This appears to be\nbolstered by the fact that one typically cannot erase a slur\u2019s\nderogation by following up with a statement intending to do so,\ne.g.,\n\n(3.3)\nThey gave the job I applied for to a s**c, but I don\u2019t\nmean to suggest there is anything bad about being Hispanic.\n\n\nThe tension of the contrast is one an audience might generally think\nfinds its source in the meaning of the slur itself, rather than from\nfeatures that emerge from the way language is used in a particular\ncontext. Further, as we saw in Jeshion\u2019s objection to\nHom\u2019s view, the information slurs manage to convey isn\u2019t\nvery specific. This point is consistent with the open-ended nature of\nthe perspectives Camp associates with slurs.\n\nThough Camp\u2019s account represents a marked improvement, critics\nstill see shortcomings they believe should give us pause. Geoff\nNunberg (2018), for instance, argues that Camp\u2019s\ncharacterization of perspectives is too vague to capture the more\nspecific colorings of slurs for specific groups: \u201cWhatever\ndistinguishes redskin from injun or nigger\nfrom coon, it\u2019s more precise and richer than simply a\ndisposition to think about the referents in certain ways\u201d\n(Nunberg, 2018, 260\u2013261). According to Nunberg, what is central\nfor how slurs work is not the perspective the user employs to think\nabout their target, but the allegiance it signals to a group or\ncommunity disposed to think negatively of the target.\n\nTo take an obvious case, when you call a woman a shiksa you\u2019re\nnot just allying yourself with a disposition to think about gentile\nwomen in certain ways, but with the people who have that disposition.\nThat group affiliation is primary and prior to the perspective it\nevokes: you can use shiksa appropriately without having any\nspecific views of gentile women at all, but not without identifying\nwith Jews. (ibid., 261)\n\n\nFor some theorists, the accounts offered by Hom and Camp leave out\nwhat they regard as an important aspect of slurring, namely, the role\nattitudinal expression plays in their derogatory power. These views\nagree that the difference between slurs and their purported\ncounterparts is located in the realm of semantics; the previous\naccounts just leave out an important aspect. Jeshion (2013a)\nidentifies three components of slurs\u2019 semantics: (i) a\ntruth-conditional component, (ii) an expressivist\ncomponent, and (iii) an identifying component. The\ntruth-conditional component of slurs corresponds to the same group\nreferenced by its purported neutral counterpart. The expressivist\ncomponent captures slurs\u2019 ability to express contempt towards\nmembers of socially relevant groups in virtue of their group\nmembership. Finally, the identifying component ascribes a property to\nthe group that is seen as central to its identity. Mark Richard (2010)\nalso proposes a view in which negative attitudes are included in the\nexplanation of what slurs express. Jeshion and Richard\u2019s\naccounts are typically referred to as expressivist views.\n\nOne issue expressivist views have been thought to have trouble with is\nderogatory variation. Derogatory variation refers to the\nsociolinguistic datum that slurs vary in their offensive potency. If\nwe represent degrees of offense on a scale, slurs like\n\u2018n***er\u2019 and \u2018k*ke\u2019 are higher up on the scale\nthan slurs like \u2018cracker\u2019 and \u2018wop.\u2019\nExpressivist views have typically attributed one sort of attitude to\nslurs\u2014contempt\u2014which seems inadequate to capture\nthe complexity of their offense profiles. For instance, consider\nco-referring slurs that vary in offense. Expressivist accounts appear\nto lack the resources to account for this variation. Thus,\nexpressivism fails as an account of slurs for this reason.\n\nJeshion (2013a) attempts to answer this objection by arguing that her\nexpressivist view \u201cis only incompatible with versions of\nderogatory variation that stipulate that the variation derives from\nthe semantics\u201d (243). Jeshion maintains that focusing on\nslurring terms rather than particular utterances of those terms causes\nus to reflect on various factors at play that contribute to their\npower to offend. In effect, such focusing obscures the various factors\nbrought to bear on judgments of offensiveness. Thus, Jeshion claims we\nought to think our intuitive judgments about varying offense support\nthe following thesis:\n\nDerogatory Variation-Utterance:\n\nUtterances of different slurring terms engender different degrees of\nintensity of offensiveness. (2013a, 244)\n\n\nJeshion argues that this thesis is compatible with her account because\nweaponized uses of slurs are offensive for several reasons: semantic,\npragmatic, sociocultural, and historical. As a result, there should be\nno expectation that a semantic view like hers need explain derogatory\nvariation semantically.\n\nInferentialism describes slurs in terms of the kinds of\ninferences they license. Proponents of this kind of view include\nRobert Brandom (1994), Michael Dummett (1993), Lynne Tirrell (1999)\nand Daniel Whiting (2008). Tirrell, for instance, remarks that the\n\u201cmeaning of a word or expression is a matter of its various\nactual and possible sentential roles\u201d (1999, 46). In\ncharacterizing the meaning of the now-outdated slur\n\u2018boche,\u2019 Dummett remarks,\n\nThe condition for applying the term to someone is that he is of German\nnationality; the consequences of its application are that he is\nbarbarous and more prone to cruelty than other Europeans. We should\nenvisage the connections in both directions as sufficiently tight as\nto be involved in the very meaning of the word: neither could be\nsevered without altering its meaning. (1993, 454)\n\n\nOn Dummett\u2019s account, to know the meaning of \u2018boche\u2019\nis to make the inference from the referent being German to his being\nbarbarous and more prone to cruelty than other Europeans.\n\nInferentialism also has its challenges. Timothy Williamson (2009), for\nexample, opposes inferentialism by charging that it has difficulty\nexplaining how non-bigots, who are not disposed to draw negative\ninferences, still understand their use. \u201cWe find racist and\nxenophobic abuse offensive because we understand it, not because we\nfail to do so\u201d (257). We should note the inferentialist is not\nwithout resources to respond to Williamson\u2019s charge. For\nexample, Brandom\u2019s (1994) inferentialism determines\nunderstanding in terms of grasping the broad network of inferential\nconnections in which an expression is situated. An important\nimplication is thought to be that different speakers will understand\nthe expression similarly while associating it with different\ninferential roles, escaping Williamson\u2019s charge that one must be\ndisposed to draw slurring inferences to understand the term (see\nSteinberger and Murzi, 2017). However, Brandom\u2019s view is itself\ncontroversial (For further objections to inferentialism, see Anderson\nand Lepore (2013b); Hornsby (2001).)\n\nThe last view we mention here is a stark alternative to the previous\naccounts, opting for a socioculturally-driven explanation. According\nto Luvell Anderson and Ernie Lepore, slurs are prohibited expressions\nwhose tokenings provoke offense from those who value and respect their\nprohibitions: \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that no matter what its\nhistory, no matter what it means or communicates, no matter who\nintroduces it, regardless of its past associations, once relevant\nindividuals declare a word a slur, it becomes one\u201d (2013a,\n39). The prohibition is meant to apply not only to uses but\nmentions of expressions as well, including direct and\nindirect reports.\n\nOne objection raised against prohibitionism comes from Camp (2018).\nCamp asserts that though the view is simple and powerful, \u201cit\nthreatens to work too well\u201d by failing to account for some\ncomplexities. In particular, Camp claims \u201cslur\u2019s\ntruth-assessibility and projective behavior are more variable than\n[prohibitionism] predicts\u201d (2018, 33). She believes, for\ninstance, that it is sometimes easy to \u201cquarantine\u201d a\nslur\u2019s offensiveness within a report like,\n\nJohn thinks that the s**cs will have taken over the whole neighborhood\nin another couple years. But of course, I think it\u2019s great that\nwe\u2019re developing such a vibrant Latino community.\n\n\nThe offense of the slur in this statement is judged to be relativized\nto John rather than the person reporting it.\n\nWhich view of slurs one adopts has implications for how one conceives\nof their harm. For instance, adopting a content-based view of slurs\nmay encourage one to adopt a content-based definition of hate speech,\nwhich suggests that the harm produced is in the message being\ncommunicated. Adopting an expressivist view, on the other hand, could\nlead one to lean more towards an intrinsic property account.
