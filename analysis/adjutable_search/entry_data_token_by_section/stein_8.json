A committed feminist from\nher youth, she was aware of the \u201cgreat cultural upheaval\u201d\n(2000c: 133[152]) in which she, following the suffragettes in England\nand similar movements in Germany, was participating. She vigorously\ndefended the right of women to enter all professions and\nbranches of education without exception (2000c: 132[105]). She rejected\ndescriptions of women as \u201cthe weaker sex\u201d (2000c: 136[157])\nand defended their capacity to work in physically demanding jobs. But\nwomen also had special expertise and should also, for instance, be\ninvolved in framing laws that affected women or children. Stein\npersonally campaigned for women to be admitted to higher education,\nespecially for the Habilitation required for university teaching. As\nan educator of women at the Dominican boarding school in Speyer, she\nwrote on the nature, status, and calling of women. Most of her public\naddresses were given to the Catholic Women Teachers Association.\n\nStein criticized the one-sided development of women in contemporary\nsociety (2000c: 87[96]). The demand for equality has sometimes meant\nthat the unique nature of women is neglected or downplayed. Stein\ncriticized the early twentieth-century suffragettes, who, in their\ngoal to establish equality between men and women, were driven to deny\nthe distinctiveness of the feminine nature (2000c: 2[254]). Women have\nnatural vocations to be spouse and mother, but they also have\nother talents: scientific, technical, artistic, and so on. All must be\nnurtured. She recognized that women of her time had \u201cthe double\nburden of family duties and professional life\u201d (2000c: 26[54])\nwhich challenged the possibility of personal fulfillment.\n\nWomen are essentially different from men. For Stein, women\u2019s\nrelation of soul to body is different from man\u2019s; the\nwoman\u2019s soul is more intimately connected to the body (2000c:\n86[95]). Moreover, women have deeper and fuller emotional lives (2000c:\n87[96]); accordingly, women have a crucial political-social role as\nthe educators of humanity. Stein insists that all education must take\ncognizance of the specific nature of woman (2000c: 141[162]), their\nspecific spirituality. She claims, whereas men can be abstract, women\nare more interested in the concrete totality: \u201cabstraction\nin every sense is alien to the feminine nature\u201d (2000c:\n19[45]). Women, furthermore, are uniquely oriented to the\npersonal dimension\u2014something that can be a virtue or a\ndefect. Women have a unique sensitivity to moral values. Women also\nlive more intensely through their bodies (2000c: 86[95]). But there is a\ndanger of the body controlling the soul. Stein, following Aquinas,\nargues that the soul is the form of the body, and as men and women\nhave different bodies, so they must have different kinds of souls\n(2000c: 18[45]). It is not the case, as some maintain, that men and\nwomen differ in bodies only and that their minds are unaffected by\nthis difference (2000c: 162[183]). Men, for Stein, are focused on their\nown concerns, women are primarily focused empathetically on\nothers.\n\nStein discussed the meaning of \u201cprofession\u201d\n(Beruf) and \u201ccalling\u201d (Ruf), discussions\nwe also find in the later Husserl. For Stein, the essence of all\neducation is religious. Men and women are called, in the first\ninstance, by God. She defends the specifically religious profession\nfor women\u2014a \u201csupernatural\u201d vocation, requiring\ngrace. Entrusting the soul to God frees religious women of their\nburden; participation in the divine life is \u201cliberating\u201d.\nIndeed, she supported the idea that married women could practice their\nreligious vocation (2000c: 92[102]). In public talks, Stein even\ntackled the contentious topic of women priests (2000c:\n76\u201377[83]). The contemporary Church, Stein maintained, has need\nof \u201cfeminine energies\u201d (2000c: 77[83]), and there is no\ndogma preventing women\u2019s ordination (2000c: 77, 139[83, 160]).\n\n\nStein also endorses the traditional account of woman as serving and\nobedient to the spouse who protects her (2000c: 19[46]). Every soul is\nunique (Stein 2000c: 80[88]). Yet there are also different\n\u201ctypes\u201d (Arten) of \u201cwomen\u2019s\nsoul\u201d. While she acknowledges that the historical relationship\nbetween the sexes (since the biblical Fall) has been one of lordship\nand bondage (2000c: 67[72]), Stein defends the essential difference\nbetween men and women (attested, she believes, in the Genesis story of\nAdam and Eve). Male and Female are equal in that both made in the\nimage of God. For her the prototype for men was Jesus, for women it\nwas Mary (2000c: 176[198]). Yet, she was aware that \u201cmodern youth\nhas proclaimed its sexual rights\u201d (2000c: 130[149]) and believed\nit urgent for Catholics to have a broadminded approach to sexuality to\nanswer these demands (2000c: 131[150]). Therefore, sex education should\nbe provided in school for boys and girls alike (2000c: 131[150]).\n\nIn summary, Stein held firm views about women\u2019s and men\u2019s\nspecific natures. But woman\u2019s role is not limited to being\ncaretakers of the young and \u201chelpmate\u201d to man. Women have\ntheir own specific talents which may contribute to social and public\nlife in many different ways, based on their individuality. She also\nheld that women were by nature not just public actors but also had a\nspecific responsibility for children. Moreover, women were more in\ntune with their affective lives, and the highest expression of their\nessence was in self-giving love. Thus, she believed in the equal but\ncomplementary status of males and females.\n",
