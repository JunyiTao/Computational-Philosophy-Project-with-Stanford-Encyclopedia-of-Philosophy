    "main_text": "The Cosmogonic Turn || Immanence\n3.3 Immanence\n\nThe third common point is that the ultimate is immanent in the world.\nVerbs in classical Chinese are not modified for tense, and this\nintroduces a fundamental ambiguity into all of these\ncosmogonies\u2014while they can be read as describing something that\nhappened in the past, they can just as well describe an ongoing\nprocess in which the generative function is always present. In one\npassage, Zhuangzi is asked where dao is and he replies that\nthere is no place from which dao is absent. Pushed to give an\nexample, he says dao is in ants and crickets. When asked to\ngo lower, Zhuangzi says dao is in weeds, broken tiles, and\neven in piss and dung (Guo 1978, 22: 750; cf. Ziporyn 2009: 89).\nSimilar statements would later be made about Buddha-nature,\nparticularly in the tradition of Chan \u79aa (Zen) Buddhism. The\nimmanence of the source is demonstrated most of all by the fact that\nit remains accessible to cultivated people. In the Laozi,\ndao is something one can use in the world:\n\n\nDao is constantly without name. Although in its unhewn\nsimplicity it is minute, heaven and earth do not dare subordinate it.\nIf princes and kings can preserve it, the ten thousand things will\nmake themselves their guests. (Ch 32)\n\n\nIt is difficult to find the right language to describe the\nrelationship between dao and human beings. The dao\nis not external and it is not an object that could be grasped, so it\nis not a matter of getting or reaching it. Since the self-so\nspontaneity to which dao refers is always present, what is\nrequired is a negative process of removing obstacles. Ziran\nis what remains if we free ourselves from striving and conventional\ngoals. Thus this same process is described as wuwei\n\u7121\u70ba, which literally means \u201clacking action\u201d\nbut refers to giving up actions that are coercive, effortful, or\nforced. The Zhuangzi describes this process as the\n\u201cfasting of the heart/mind\u201d (xinzhai\n\u5fc3\u9f4b), which allows us to rely directly on vital energy\n(qi) and respond spontaneously to whatever appears before us\n(Guo 1978, 4: 147; cf. Ziporyn 2009: 26).\n",
