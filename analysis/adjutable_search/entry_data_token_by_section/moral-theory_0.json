    "main_text": "Morality\n1. Morality\n\n\nWhen philosophers engage in moral theorizing, what is it that they are\ndoing? Very broadly, they are attempting to provide a systematic\naccount of morality. Thus, the object of moral theorizing is morality,\nand, further, morality as a normative system.\n\nAt the most minimal, morality is a set of norms and principles that\ngovern our actions with respect to each other and which are taken to\nhave a special kind of weight or authority (Strawson 1961). More\nfundamentally, we can also think of morality as consisting of moral\nreasons, either grounded in some more basic value, or, the other way\naround, grounding value (Raz 1999).\n\nIt is common, also, to hold that moral norms are universal\nin the sense that they apply to and bind everyone in similar\ncircumstances. The principles expressing these norms are also\nthought to be general, rather than specific, in that they are\nformulable \u201cwithout the use of what would be intuitively\nrecognized as proper names, or rigged definite descriptions\u201d\n(Rawls 1979, 131). They are also commonly held to be\nimpartial, in holding everyone to count equally.\n",
