    "main_text": "Slow Switching Arguments || Reply 2: Relevant Alternatives\n3.2 Reply 2: Relevant Alternatives\n\nA different reply to slow switch arguments may have seemed obvious\nfrom the start. It is that the slow switch thought experiment is a\nbizarre piece of science fiction, and is simply irrelevant to whether\nwe know our own thoughts from the armchair. After all, unlike\nOscar, we are not the victims of covert switches. So how\ncould the experiment bear on our capacity for armchair\nself-knowledge?\n\nThe point is often framed in terms of a \u201crelevant\nalternatives\u201d epistemology (cf. Goldman 1976; 1986). The\nsuggestion is that in order to know that p, one does not need\nto rule out every possible scenario where ~p. Rather,\nit suffices just to rule out the \u201crelevant alternatives\u201d\nwhere ~p. And ordinarily, deviant skeptical possibilities are\nnot among the relevant alternatives that a knower needs to exclude.\nThus, while driving along the countryside, one can ordinarily know if\none sees a barn\u2014even without excluding the possibility of a mere\nbarn fa\u00e7ade. For barn fa\u00e7ades are ordinarily irrelevant.\nIn the same way, slow switch possibilities ordinarily are irrelevant\nto knowing what content a thought has (Warfield 1992, Falvey &\nOwens 1994, Gibbons 1996, Brown 2004, ch. 2). Accordingly, it is\nnormally unnecessary to rule out such a possibility in order to know\nfrom the armchair one\u2019s own thought.\n\nBut what determines relevance exactly? A popular answer comes from the\nepistemic contextualists (DeRose 1995; 2009, Lewis 1998; see also the\nentry on\n epistemic contextualism).\n Contextualism in the first instance is a view about knowledge, yet it\nimplies that whether an alternative is relevant is determined by the\nevidential standards in the context. Consider that in order\nto know whether it is raining, normally one can just take a look out\nthe window. When engaging a Cartesian skeptic, however, that is\ninsufficient. For the skeptic \u201craises the bar\u201d on the\nevidence needed to know by imagining bizarre alternatives that he\nwants ruled out, e.g., the possibility that you are dreaming.\nSimilarly, some compatibilists regard slow switching as a bizarre\nskeptical possibility which makes exceedingly high the evidential\nstandards for knowledge (Hohwy 2002; Neta 2003 is also pertinent). So\nif context makes that possibility relevant, one may lose the ability\nto self-know from the armchair. Still, if switching possibilities are\nirrelevant, contextualism says that even an externalist can know her\nown thoughts from the armchair.\n\nWhen first championing the memory argument, Boghossian (1989) noted\nthe reply from relevant alternatives, yet maintained that the slow\nswitch experiment still shows a conflict between EXT and SK. For one\ncan imagine cases where slow switching is a relevant\nalternative. And in those cases, one could not rule out this\npossibility just from the armchair. Even the relevant alternatives\naccount denies the externalist armchair self-knowledge in such a\nscenario. Still, why does this reveal a problem with our\nself-knowledge? If slow switching actually occurred on a regular\nbasis, it would be a relevant alternative that could not be excluded\nfrom the armchair, and the externalist would lose SK. But to\nacknowledge a possible scenario of this sort does not mean that EXT\nand SK are incompatible (Warfield 1992). It shows merely that\nif EXT is true, self-knowledge is not necessarily within\nreach from the armchair.\n\nIn reply, some incompatibilists subversively suggest that switches\ndo occur on a regular basis (Ludlow 1995b; Butler 1997). In\nsection\n 1,\n we saw that one \u201cTwin Earth\u201d scenario might occur in the\nactual world: Recall the superficially indiscernible extensions of\n\u2018chicory\u2019 and \u2018endive\u2019, which are swapped\nbetween British and Standard American English. An American ex-patriot\nthus could be unwittingly fooled into denoting chicory when speaking\nor thinking about \u201cendive.\u201d Still, this seems like an\natypical case. But to the contrary, the potential for an undetected\nswitch might be as common as the potential for polysemy in the\nlanguage (Ludlow 1995b). Consider that between different philosophical\ncircles, the term \u2018pragmatism\u2019 denotes different yet\nsuperficially similar philosophical theses. So thanks to unnoticed\nswitches between subgroups, one might be fooled into saying or\nbelieving things about different kinds of pragmatism. Such variation\namong linguistic subgroups seems entirely commonplace. It is the\nprevalence of these switches, moreover, that makes them\nrelevant even if no actual switch occurs in a given instance.\n\nIn her defense, a compatibilist can observe that these cases are not\ncases of slow switching, and the usual view is that contents\ndo not change in a \u201cquick switch.\u201d (Though the\nindividuation of some cognitive processes may switch immediately; see\nClark & Chalmers 1998). Yet even if slow switches regularly occur,\nthis still does not show that EXT and SK are incompatible (Warfield\n1997). It might mean that EXT and SK are not jointly true in our\nworld. Nevertheless, they still might hold in some other possible\nworld; so no incompatibility strictly follows.\n\nRegardless, it may be troubling enough if an externalist cannot\nactually have armchair self-knowledge (Ludlow 1997). It is\nstandardly agreed, moreover, that the externalist should concede one\ntype of armchair self-knowledge\u2014namely, knowledge that is\ndiscriminatory between water contents and twin contents, a.k.a.\n\u201ccomparative knowledge\u201d of content (Falvey & Owens\n1994; see also Mendola 2008). But this may not be a huge concession,\nsince one may remain capable of knowing a self-verifying judgment that\n(W) from the armchair, absent any comparisons with twin contents.\nBesides, there is independent reason to reject such comparative\nknowledge anyway (see Owens 1990; 1992).\n\nA different issue is that if a compatibilist concedes SK when switches\nare relevant, she may be conceding too much (Goldberg 2006a). For\nthere is a persistent Cartesian intuition that armchair self-knowledge\nshould be unaffected by skeptical hypotheses about the external world.\nFollowing Meditation Two, even if an evil demon is deceiving\nme, it still seems I can know what I am currently thinking. Yet the\nslow switch experiment suggests that this Cartesian intuition is\nmistaken. For if a slow switch hypothesis is relevant, then even a\nrelevant alternatives epistemology demands that we discriminate water\nthoughts from twin water thoughts. Yet one is unable to do so from the\narmchair. So apparently, some deviant hypotheses about the external\nworld can undermine armchair knowledge of one\u2019s own\noccurrent thoughts, contra the Cartesian intuition. Something\nimportant about armchair self-knowledge may be lost.\n\nBut a relevant alternatives compatibilist might still rescue the\nCartesian intuition. First, note that in many slow switch arguments,\nthe issue is not whether Oscar knows that he thinks that\np from the armchair; rather, it is whether Oscar knows\nwhat he thinks. And unlike ascriptions of \u201cknowledge\nthat,\u201d ascriptions of \u201cknowledge what\u201d are\nappropriate only relative to one\u2019s goals or\npurposes in a context (Bo\u00ebr & Lycan 1986, Braun 2006,\nDeRose 2009, ch. 2,\n appendix).[22]\n Hence, whether it is apt to say \u201cOscar knows what he\nthinks\u201d partly depends on contextually salient goals or\npurposes. Granted, if Oscar\u2019s goal is to discriminate between a\ncontent and a twin content, then he cannot \u201cknow what\u201d he\nthinks from the armchair. However, it may be that for other\nanti-skeptical purposes, Oscar can indeed \u201cknow what\u201d\n(Parent 2015b, 2017, chs. 5 and 10). For instance, suppose the skeptic\nchallenges Oscar on whether he knows the truth of anything with\ncertainty. Then, if Oscar points to his self-verifying judgment (W)\n(\u201cI am thinking forthwith that water is wet\u201d) this could\ncount as meeting the challenge. It is a case where the truth of\nhis judgment is certain, even if its content is in question. So\nat least relative to that goal, Oscar may know what he thinks (Parent\n2015b, 2017, ch. 5).\n\nBefore closing this section, it is worth noting that compatibilists\nsometimes prefer not to insist on the irrelevance of slow switches,\nbut rather to contest whether their relevance undercuts armchair\nself-knowledge (Falvey & Owens 1994, Gibbons 1996, Butler 1997,\nMcLaughlin & Tye 1998a, Vahid 2003, Brown 2004, Morvarid 2015). A\nvariety of inferential principles might lead to the\nincompatibilist\u2019s conclusion from the relevance of slow\nswitching. As a more noteworthy example, the principle here might be\nsome kind of \u201ctruth tracking\u201d condition; cf. Nozick 1981\n(Falvey & Owens 1994). On this approach, the slow switch argument\nassumes that (W) does not express knowledge, since the subject S fails\nto track the truth in the following sense:\n\n\n\n(TC)\nS \u2019s justification for the belief that p is\nsuch that, if some relevant alternative were true instead, S\nwould still believe that p.  \n\n\n\nAccording to (TC), S fails to know since her justification\nwould not divert her judgment, in a relevant scenario where the\njudgment is false. However, if this is the principle operative in the\narguments, it seems they can be resisted (Falvey & Owens 1994).\nPlausibly, we do not satisfy (TC) when it comes to\nself-verifying judgments (see section\n 3.1).\n For if we consider a counterfactual where I have twin water thoughts\nin lieu of water thoughts, I cannot believe I have water\nthoughts. A self-attribution expressed as \u201cI am thinking that\nwater is wet\u201d would inevitably attribute a twin water thought\ninstead. My self-attribution \u201ctracks the truth\u201d perfectly\nin the counterfactual circumstances.\n",
