Whilst it may seem plausible to some\nthat moral values or perhaps even colours might disappear with the\nextinction of sentient life on Earth, it is not at all plausible to\nthink that trees, rocks and microbes would follow in their train. \n\nThis is not how Putnam understands his idea of conceptual relativity,\nhowever, which thesis he distinguishes from conceptual relativism. As\nhe sees things, we accept a theory which licenses us to assert\n\u201cElectrons exist\u201d and also licenses us to assert \u201cif\nhumans were to disappear from this planet, electrons need not follow\nin their train\u201d since the theory assures us that the existence\nof electrons in no way causally depends on the existence of humans.\nFor the anti-realist our well-founded practices of assertion ground at\none and the same time our conception of the world and our conception\nof humanity\u2019s place within it.\n\nRealists might still worry that whether there are to be any electrons\nin the anti-realist\u2019s ontology apparently depends upon the\nconceptual schemes humans happen to chance upon and Putnam himself\nencourages this interpretation: \u201c\u2018objects\u2019 do not\nexist independently of conceptual schemes\u201d [Putnam 1981]. The\nrelativity of existence to conceptual scheme is, in this respect,\nquite unlike the relativity of simultaneity to frame of reference.\n\nStill, anti-realists maintain that there are actual instances of\nconceptual schemes that explain the same phenomena equally well,\nschemes which, they aver, realists must judge to be logically\nincompatible. The earlier example of competing theories of space-time\nwas a case in point. On one theory, \\(T_1\\), space-time consists of\nunextended spatiotemporal points and regions of space-time are sets of\nthese points. According to the second theory, \\(T_2\\), space-time\nconsists of extended spatiotemporal regions and points are logical\nconstructions\u2014convergent sets of regions. Realists will judge\nthat only one of the two theories can be true if they really are\nlogically incompatible. Anti-realists respond that the two theories\n\\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) cannot differ in truth-value since they are\ndescriptively equivalent. \n\nAnti-realists regard two theories as descriptively equivalent if each\ntheory can be interpreted in the other and both theories explain the\nsame phenomena. Is there nothing more to the notion of descriptive\nequivalence than this? Realists might not accept that there\nisn\u2019t.\n\nConsider our two competing theories of space-time \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\)\nagain. Are \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) descriptively equivalent? At the stroke\nof midnight Cinderella\u2019s carriage changes into a\npumpkin\u2014it is a carriage up to midnight, a pumpkin thereafter.\nAccording to the region-based theory \\(T_2\\) which takes temporal\nintervals as its primitives, that\u2019s all there is to it. But if\nthere are temporal points, instants, as \\(T_1\\) affirms, there is a\nfurther issue left undecided by this story\u2014viz, at the moment of\nmidnight is the carriage still a carriage or is it a pumpkin?\n\nSo does the region-based theory fail to recognize certain facts or are\nthese putative facts merely artefacts of the punctate theory\u2019s\ndescriptive resources, reflecting nothing in reality? We cannot\ndeclare the two theories \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) descriptively equivalent\nuntil we resolve this question at least.\n\nIn fact, there is no reason why realists cannot agree with\nanti-realists in regarding the conflict between a punctate geometry\nand a region-based geometry as merely apparent. Thomas\nWilliam Barrett and Hans Halvorson argue that the two theories \u201c\n\u2026 are simply convenient ways of expressing the geometric facts that\nare more fully expressed by a comprehensive theory\u201d that\nquantifies over both points and lines. \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) cannot be\nincompatible according to Barrett and Halvorson because they are in\nessence the same theory [Barrett and Halvorson 2017].\nHowever, the geometric case is a rather special one.\n\nConsider another Putnam-styled case [Putnam 2004]. Ernie looks into\nhis bag and sees there are 3 coins and nothing else and announces\n\u201cThere are exactly 3 objects in my bag.\u201d Maxi looks into\nErnie\u2019s bag and shakes her head \u201cNo Ernie there are 7\nobjects in your bag!\u201d she corrects him. The Carnapian pluralist\nfeels she can defuse the conflict and accommodate both points of view\nby maintaining that whilst 3 objects exist-in-\\(E\\) (where \\(E\\) is\nErnie\u2019s everyday framework), 7 objects exist-in-\\(M\\) (with\n\\(M\\) Maxi\u2019s mereological framework). But even if Maxi can\nendorse both of these claims (since the mereological objects include\nErnie\u2019s 3 coins), it is not at all certain Ernie can do so. If\nErnie is unpersuaded that mereological fusions of objects are\nthemselves objects, then Maxi\u2019s putative truthmaker for her\nframework-relative existence claim \u201c7 objects\nexist-in-\\(M\\)\u201d will be unconvincing to him.\n\nFor this case, the pluralist\u2019s suggestion that 3 objects\nexist-in-\\(E\\) but 7 objects exist-in-\\(M\\) is not clearly warranted.\nThere are simpler explanations: one is that by \u2018object\u2019\nErnie means ordinary object, by \u2018object\u2019 Maxi means\nmereological object. Nothing deeper than that is required to explain\ntheir disagreement. Rather than existence or truth that is\nrelativized, the meanings of their terms differ. On this account,\npluralists have mistaken a plurality of meanings for a plurality of\nmodes of being. However, other explanations are also possible: for\ninstance, it may be that Ernie and Maxi do mean the same thing by\n\u2018object\u2019 but hold incompatible theories about what counts\nas an object. More importantly, as a reviewer noted, the debate\nneed not turn on the notion of an object: it can proceed with\nquantifiers, for example. The disagreement then would arise from\ndivergent interpretations of those quantifiers.\n\nPutnam\u2019s pluralism has provoked very different reactions from\nrealists. Some argue that conceptual pluralism is consistent with\nrealism [Lynch 1998; Horgan and Timmons 2002; Sosa 2003], others take\nPutnam\u2019s pluralism to amount to the claim that ontological\nexpressions are either indeterminate or that alternative ontologies\nare equally good, both alternatives being problematic [Eklund 2008].\nRealists cannot make sense of the Carnapian idea that existence and\ntruth are relative to a conceptual scheme [Brueckner 1998]. Peter van\nInwagen provides a trenchant criticism of Putnam\u2019s claims [van\nInwagen 2002]: \n\nI cannot grant that \u2018Carnap\u2019s\u2019 [DK: Ernie\u2019s]\nand \u2018The Polish logician\u2019s\u2019 [DK: Maxi\u2019s]\ndescriptions are equally good or equivalent descriptions of the\npopulation of a world [DK: e.g. the contents of Ernie\u2019s\nbag]\u2014not at least if Carnap\u2019s description is \u2018a\nworld that contains three mereological simples and nothing\nelse\u2019. I cannot grant that they could be \u2018equally\ngood or equivalent descriptions of the population of a world\u2019\nsince they are straightforwardly incompatible.\n\n\nRecently, however, some impressive neo-Carnapian defences of\nconceptual pluralism have been proposed that bring new considerations\nto bear on these debates. We briefly review some of these in section\n5.\n",
