Methodological Issues\n4.1 On Generalizations Cultural and Philosophical\n Deciding whether to be basically narrative or dialogical is\nprobably the first issue facing the exegete. Another issue\ninterpreters of Chinese texts must take into consideration in\nadvancing their positions is the extent to which one may make\ngeneralizations about Chinese civilization and culture writ large.\n This question arises because the conceptual categories within\nwhich Chinese authors thought and wrote differ sufficiently from the\ncontemporary English reader\u2019s that the former will be very\ndifficult to understand without being placed in a larger cultural and\nphilosophical overall conceptual framework, at least at first\nperusal. At the same time, however, if Western scholars are inclined\nto shudder when they hear sweeping generalizations about the history\nof Western culture and philosophy, knowing how diverse they really\nhave been and are, we should perhaps want to embrace the Golden Rule,\nand do unto other cultures what we would have done with our own.  And\nit can also be highly misleading, as a number of sinologists have been\narguing recently against their generalizing colleagues.\nThis is a perplexing problem. If we do not generalize to the larger\nmilieu in which a particular text is placed it is difficult to\nappreciate either what it says or the significance it has in the\nculture that grew it. But if the best we can do\u2014like a number of\nlate 19th century German scholars\u2014is characterize\nChina as a land of ewigen Stillstand we are surely better off\nwith no generalizations whatsoever; making vague or erroneous\ngeneralizations tend to stereotypes, and there are already a\nsuperfluity of these for China, from Charlie Chan to Fu Manchu.\n Thus the historian Michael Puett warns us that\nAll of these interpretive\n  strategies\u2014reading in terms of schools, essentialized\n  definitions of culture, evolutionary frameworks\u2014have the\n  consequence of erasing the unique power that particular claims had\n  at the time,\n  \n and recommends that \nwe dispense with \u2026 frameworks\u2026\n[and] \u2026 should instead work on a more nuanced approach\u2026.\n(Puett 2004: 23\u201325).\n \nBut on the other side is the Shang Dynasty historian David\nKeightley, who believes it important to essay major generalizations\nand who addresed the issue by asking \u201cWhat made China\nChinese?\u201d (Keightley 2014). The reader of that paper will see\nthat in addressing the grand question Keightley throws light on\nanother, closer to home: what makes us \u201cus?\u201d\nYet at the same time Puett was not simply crying\n\u201cwolf\u201d. A disturbingly large number of scholars have made\ngeneralizations that were not simply misleading in their consequences,\nbut have had racist, or \u201corientalist\u201d undertones, or, more\ncommonly, have just been plain flat-out wrong. To take only a few more\negregious examples, although not a trained sinologist, Kant studied\nChina and lectured on Chinese thought in his geography classes\nincluding statements that Confucius taught nothing but manners for the\nelite, and referred to the views of the Daodejing as\n\u201cthe monster system of Laotse\u201d; generalizing his remarks\nto \u201ca concept of virtue and morality never entered the heads of\nthe Chinese\u201d (Ching 1978: 168\u201369). These examples could be\nmultiplied many times over, and are not relics from the past:\n \nIt can be argued that almost every change China\n has ever undergone originated from abroad or because of some foreign\n stimulus. (Deeker 2013: 70)\nMoreover, there is an additional reason for eschewing\ngeneralizations (Goldin 2008: 21):\n \nIf there is one valid generalization about China,\nit is that China defies generalization.  Chinese civilization is\nsimply to huge, too diverse and too old for neat\nmaxims.\nUndercutting the image of a multimillenia, monolithic static\nculture is certainly a good thing, politically as well as\nintellectually.  Arguably more nonsense and worse has been written\nabout China than any other non-Western culture, and it is ongoing, as\nabove. But perhaps we should not eschew generalizations about China\naltogether. Shifting the angle of vision only very slightly Roger Ames\ngave an important rejoinder to the anti-generalizers (Ames 2011: 21):\n \nI would maintain that the only thing more\ndangerous than striving to make responsible cultural generalizations\nis failing to make them\u2026 .  Philosophical interpreters must\nsensitize the student of Chinese philosophy to the ambient uncommon\nassumptions that have made the Chinese philosophical narrative so\ndifferent from our own.\nPerhaps Keightley should have the last word on this issue. As\njustification for his asking \u201cWhat makes the Chinese\nChinese?\u201d He said:\nThe Chinese, after all, have probably fed more\npeople more successfully than any or other culture in world\nhistory. How they developed the social capital to do this is well\nworth our study. (2014: 83)\nGiven that it is nigh unto impossible to give an interpretation of\na text without making generalizations that go considerably beyond it,\nwe should give the nod to the pros rather than the cons in this\nparticular debate, but the latter perform the salutary function of\nwarning students to take the generalizations lightly at all times, and\nabandon them for others in the light of further study.\n4.2 Translating the Truth\n Davidson\u2019s focus on propositional truth\n(\u00a72.2 above) is altogether in\nkeeping with the concern of most Anglophone 20th century\nphilosophers to analyze language as the main means of communicating\nfacts about the world to our fellow human beings. When the facts are\nindeed as communicated, we say the statements expressing them are\n\u201ctrue\u201d. The precise nature of the relation between the\nfacts and the statements of them has generated different theories of\ntruth\u2014correspondence, coherence, pragmatic, semantic, even\n\u201cdeflationary\u201d\u2014with the question remaining an open\none today, although fewer philosophers are pursuing an answer to\nit.\n No matter which theory one adopts, elaborating this concept of\n\u201ctruth\u201d involves a cluster of related\nconcepts: sentence, proposition, statement, fact, semantics,\nreference, connotation, denotation, plus a few others. There is\nanother conception of \u201ctruth\u201d, however, where the direct\nconveying of information is not central to the definition, and\nconsequently \u201cknowledge\u201d is also conceived somewhat\ndifferently. Other uses of language might be equally or more important\nfor some philosophers. Remember Chad Hansen\u2019s claim\n(\u00a72.2) that all of the\nearly Chinese philosophers held that \u201clanguage is a social\npractice. Its basic function is guiding discourse \u201d (1992:\n3). If so, then the standard translation of the graph zhi as\n\u201cknowledge\u201d becomes problematic, identified as it is with\n\u201cjustified true belief\u201d. Rosemont argues that \u201cWe\nare inclined to focus on the informative uses of language, that is,\nthe transmission of knowledge that\u201d. On his account\nreaders will profit more if zhi is translated as\n\u201crealize\u201d instead of \u201cknowledge\u201d, following\nHall and Ames (1987). \u201cIf \u2018to personalize\u2019 means\n\u2018to make personal\u2019, then \u2018to realize\u2019 is\n\u2018to make real\u2019 in the sense of knowing how, knowing\nabout, knowing to\u201d (Rosemont 2012: 47). Much the same thing\nhas been noted by Stephen Angle and Justin Tiwald in a forthcoming\nbook on Neo-Confucianism, in which they say they will focus on\n\u201cknowledge as an activity rather than knowledge as a set of\ntruths\u201d (2015: 5, 1).\nThis, too, may be construed as \u201ctruth\u201d, even though not\npropositional, and with a different concept-cluster around\nit: authenticity, engagement, trustworthy,\nintegrity, honesty, upright, and more. In\n2014 a Symposium celebrating the inauguration of a new online journal\nof cross-cultural philosophy (Confluence, 1, 1) was devoted\nto the question of whether the concept of truth was useful in the\npursuit of cross-cultural philosophical research. The four symposiasts\nrepresented Japanese philosophy, Confucianism, Aztec philosophy and\nTibetan Buddhism. None of them found close approximations for\n\u201ctruth\u201d in the propositional sense in the cultures they\nstudied, but all four said there were analogues for the terms\nassociated with truth as \u201ctruthfulness\u201d in the lexicons of\nthe thinkers and traditions they worked with. This non-propositional\nsense of truth is of course not unknown in the West; everyone\nunderstands what Vaclav Havel meant when he entitled an anthology of\nhis essays Living in Truth (1990). But it has not been a\nmajor concern among English-speaking philosophers since the analytic\nmovement got under way a little over a century ago.\nHelping people to hold true beliefs is a very worthwhile endeavor,\nand so is helping them transform themselves to lead meaningful\nlives. The translator/interpreter must be aware of which approach is\nreflected in the text under examination. If we believe the author(s)\nwere concerned with the way things are in the world, we will employ\ninterpretive methods to ascertain the truth of the claims made,\nnamely, those methods concerned with propositional truth: logical and\nlinguistic analysis, especially in the Anglophone tradition, and/or\nhermeneutics or phenomenology among continental philosophers.\n If we understand the ancient Chinese philosophers as having\nanother basic aim, however, we might pause at using Western\ninterpretive strategies adopted for propositional truth-seeking to\nstudy the praxis-guiding normative statements of the Chinese. In\npraxis-guiding discourse(s) human flourishing for oneself and others\nwas the basic concern. Put another way, the standard style of Western\nphilosophical writings tends to be explanatory and justificatory,\nwhereas the Chinese style tends to be narrative (of experience) and\nnormative. There are exceptions in both cases of course; normativity\nis no more unknown in the West than explanations are in China. But in\ngeneral truth is associated with facts and propositions in modern\nWestern philosophical texts, and with values and the conduct of\none\u2019s life in China\u2019s classical texts. If so, it is by no\nmeans clear that the methodologies developed for philosophical\ncritiques and exegeses in the modern Western tradition are suitable\nfor application mutatis mutandis to Chinese classical\nwritings; attempting to uncover and explicate one kind of truth may\nwell hinder acquiring insights about the other.\n4.3 Translating the Sounds of Silence\nThese two different senses of \u201ctruth\u201d bespeak two\ndifferent orientations toward philosophy and its purposes; we might\nloosely refer to them as truth- seeking and way-making. The\ntruth-seeking approach is familiar to us, being at the heart of the\nWestern intellectual tradition, in science no less than\nphilosophy. And philosophical analysis, hermeneutics and phenomenology\nare all tried and true methods for teasing the (propositional) truth\nfrom texts. The model for writing in this philosophical tradition is\nclarity and precision of expression (at least in the analytic\nschool).\nIt is not at all clear, however, that those methods are equally\nappropriate for working with Chinese texts much of the time. There are\ntwo reasons for this, the first of which is the Chinese model of\nwriting. Hark back to the discussion of classical Chinese earlier\n(\u00a71\u20131.4) while reading the following two quotes. First,\nfrom some NLP computer scientists:\n\nClassical Chinese poetry \u2026 is particularly concise, finely\nrich, highly rhetorical and thus linguistically complex, requiring a\nhigh degree of creativity in writing it, sophisticated interpretation\nin reading it, and difficulty in understanding it. (Fang, et\nal. 2009).\nThe comment is specifically about poetry but the point is fairly\ngeneral, especially for the canonical texts of the early period. For\nthe next quote, readers should keep in mind the Western philosophical\nmodel of writing, with clarity and precision the most valued narrative\nqualities. Michael Nylan again (2011: 66):\n Polysemy eminently suits the serious classical\nturn. For where words have more than one meaning, their appearance is\napt to induce an initial state of confusion. This confusion proves\nuseful if it makes readers aware that it is context and context alone\nthat determines the values and valences that words assume in any piece\nof writing, binding author to reader in the construction and\nreconstruction of meaning.\nIf analytic and hermeneutic methods do not get us to the\n\u201ctruths\u201d found in the classical texts, what other methods\nmight be employed? Leigh Jenco (2007) has argued that while the\nnon-Western orientation in comparative philosophy is clear from the\ntexts studied, the possibilities for using\nnon-western methodologies for philosophical inquiry into\nthose texts are not, and hence the adequacy of Eurocentric approaches\nto the discipline can be maintained, as well as the \u201cnot really\nphilosophy\u201d charge frequently levelled against Chinese texts\nbecause they do not contain arguments, are ambiguous, have little\nempirical or logical content, etc. Put another way, while Chinese\ntexts can become objects of study for the ideas contained in them,\ntheir methods of scholarly inquiry never enter the picture, continuing\nthereby to legitimate a Eurocentric approach to scholarly\nmethodologies.\nKalmanson (2017) picks up on Jenco\u2019s themes,\ndescribing Chinese methods for gaining insights from Chinese texts\nsuch as ritual preparation before reading them, meditation,\nmemorization and recitation. At first blush it might seem bizarre to\nsuggest that the performance of rituals, memorization and recitation\nshould be called \u201cmethods\u201d for interrogating philosophical\ntexts. But the bizarreness can lessen if we can get away from\npropositional truth, knowing-that, and expository models of clarity\nand precision.  The classical Chinese texts are composites more or\nless, are neither clear nor precise, are extremely terse, appeal to\nthe eye and the ear equally, and are replete with ambiguities. Yet the\nChinese have long held that those texts, composed and/or edited by the\nsages, contain all the truths needed to lead an exemplary life, a\nbelief firmly held by many for over 2000 years\u2014and still held by\nmore than a few today. Is it possible that we may gain more insight\ninto the \u201ctruths\u201d of the Daodejing by memorizing\nand then reciting it than by subjecting it to logical and linguistic\nanalysis?  The famous scholar-philosopher Zhu Xi of the\n13th century suggested how we should read, and his advice\nis perhaps an appropriate coda to this entry on issues in translating\nand interpreting Chinese philosophy:\n There is layer upon layer [of meaning] in the words of\nthe sages. In your reading of them, penetrate deeply. If you simply\nread what is on the surface you will misunderstand. Steep yourself in\nthe words; only then will you grasp their meaning.
