    "main_text": "Knowledge of causal powers || Al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s skeptical argument\n4.3 Averroes\u2019 argument from natural science\n\nIn response to the skeptical argument, Averroes appeals to the fact of\nnatural science: We do have (some) knowledge of the natural world.\nFurthermore, knowledge of the natural world just is knowledge of the\nnatural causes of change (Averroes ITI: 318\u201319). Such knowledge\nmust be derived, at least in part, from repeated observation of\nbodies. He also suggests that none of us sincerely doubts that this is\nso: he claims that his occasionalist opponent \u201cdenies with his\ntongue what is present in his mind\u201d (Averroes ITI: 318). So, as\nAverroes sees it, the fact of natural science is sufficient reason to\nreject the skeptical argument. Still, he acknowledges that we lack\ncomplete knowledge of nature, that much remains to be investigated and\nthat this endeavor faces various obstacles.\n\nWhile Averroes\u2019 argument from natural science may succeed\nagainst some versions of the skeptical argument, it is not clear that\nit succeeds against its immediate target, al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s\nskeptical argument. The latter argument may leave open the possibility\nthat natural bodies, such as fire, are causes (McGinnis 2006). For\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b does not conclude his skeptical argument by\ndenying that fire is a cause of the burning tout court;\nrather, he denies that it has action on the ground that it is\ninanimate and he denies that the fire alone is the agent of burning.\nSo, al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b may hold that the fire is a (non-active)\ncause of the burning, while God is its active cause.\n\nOn this interpretation, al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s skeptical\nargument merely denies that the evidence of repeated observation shows\nthat natural bodies are the sole causes of change. So, that argument\nis compatible with the claim that the evidence of repeated observation\nindicates that natural bodies are among the causes of change.\nAverroes, however, suggests that al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b denies the\nlatter claim. So, his argument from natural science does not succeed\nagainst al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s skeptical argument. On the other\nhand, to allow that natural bodies are among the causes of change may\nnot be sufficient to avoid a problem raised by Averroes\u2019\nargument from natural science. Averroes\u2019 argument involves the\nidea that repeated observation of bodies gives us insight into their\nnatures. By \u201cnature\u201d is meant an intrinsic principle of\nmotion and coming to rest. So, the argument demands more than the\nconcession that natural bodies make some causal contribution to\nchange. It demands that the causality of natural bodies is rooted in\nand explained by their natures.\n\nAl-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s Ash\u2019arite predecessors tend to deny\nthe existence of Aristotelian natures because these would impose\nrestrictions on God\u2019s action. If a body has an Aristotelian\nnature, it has an internal principle, which restricts the sorts of\nchanges it can undergo from one moment to the next. For example, the\ndead cannot be raised and a staff cannot become a snake. According to\nIslamic theology, however, God can raise the dead and turn a staff\ninto a snake. Thus, bodies do not have Aristotelian natures, since the\nexistence of such natures would conflict with the doctrine of divine\nomnipotence.\n\nAl-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b appears to reject this more traditional\nAsh\u2019arite view when he argues that the existence of bodily\nnatures is compatible with the occurrence of miracles. This argument\nmay reflect a concern to reconcile theology with natural science. It\nproposes that, even if we suppose that bodies have natures as\nconstrued by the philosophers, God could still cause miracles in two\nmain ways. On the one hand, he could impede the operation of natural\ncausal powers. For example, God could prevent the burning of Abraham\nin the fiery furnace by causing the fire\u2019s heat to be contained\nwithin the fire or by causing Abraham to be covered in talc. On the\nother hand, God could cause a miracle by causing a series of natural\nchanges to occur with astonishing speed. For example, God could change\nthe staff in a serpent by causing matter to take on successive forms\nat an accelerated rate:\n\n\nThus, earth and the rest of the elements change into plants,\nplants-when eaten by animals-into blood, blood then changing into\nsperm. Sperm is then poured into the womb and develops in stages as an\nanimal; this, in accordance with habit, takes place in a lengthy\nperiod of time. Why, then, should the opponent deem it impossible that\nit lies within God\u2019s power to cycle matter through these stages\nin a time shorter than has been known? (al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b IP:\n172)\n\n\nSo, the affirmation of bodily natures is compatible with the belief\nmiracles.\n\nWhether this argument shows al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b to hold that it is\npossible that bodies have natures is a matter or dispute (Marmura\n1981b; Frank 1992; Griffel 2009). Averroes takes the argument to\nconcede the philosophers\u2019 view that bodies have natures by which\nthey function as causes of change (Averroes ITI: 330). Still, there\nremains a crucial difference between al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s view\nand that of the philosophers. Even if al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b allows that\nbodies may have natures, he also considers divine choice and action to\ngovern particular events in the sublunary world. God can plan and\nexecute particular events, which deviate from or accelerate the course\nof nature. The latter aspect of his view is incompatible with the\nphilosophers\u2019 accounts of God, as discussed above in\n \u00a73.3.\n",
