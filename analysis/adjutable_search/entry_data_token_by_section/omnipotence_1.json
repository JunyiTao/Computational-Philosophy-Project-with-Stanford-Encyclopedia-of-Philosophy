    "main_text": "The Scope of Omnipotence\n2. The Scope of Omnipotence\n\nThe intelligibility of the notion of omnipotence has been challenged\nby the so-called paradox or riddle of the stone. Can an omnipotent\nagent, Jane, bring it about that there is a stone of some mass, \\(m\\),\nwhich Jane cannot move? If the answer is\n\u2018yes\u2019, then there is a state of affairs that Jane cannot\nbring about, namely, (S1) that a stone of mass \\(m\\)\nmoves. On the other hand, if the answer is\n\u2018no\u2019, then there is another state of affairs that Jane\ncannot bring about, namely, (S2) that there is a stone of mass \\(m\\)\nwhich Jane cannot move. Thus, it seems that\nwhether or not Jane can make the stone in question, there is some\npossible state of affairs that an omnipotent agent cannot bring about.\nAnd this appears to be paradoxical.\n\nA first resolution of the paradox comes into play when Jane is an\nessentially omnipotent agent. In that case, the state of\naffairs of Jane\u2019s being non-omnipotent is impossible. Therefore,\nJane cannot bring it about that she is not omnipotent. Since,\nnecessarily, an omnipotent agent can move any stone, no matter how\nmassive, (S2) is impossible. But, as we have seen, an omnipotent agent\nis not required to be able to bring about an impossible state of\naffairs.\n\nIf, on the other hand, Jane is an accidentally omnipotent\nagent, both (S1) and (S2) are possible, and it is\npossible for some omnipotent agent to bring it about that (S1) obtains\nat one time, and that (S2) obtains at a different time. Thus,\nthere is a second solution to the paradox. In this case, Jane\u2019s\nbeing non-omnipotent is a possible state of affairs; thus, we may\nassume that it is possible for Jane to bring it about that\nshe is non-omnipotent. So, Jane can create and move a stone, \\(s\\),\nof mass, \\(m\\), while omnipotent, and\nsubsequently bring it about that she is not omnipotent and\npowerless to move \\(s\\). As a consequence, Jane can\nbring about both (S1) and (S2), but only if they obtain at different\ntimes.\n\nIt might now be conjectured that omnipotence can be analyzed simply as\nthe power to bring it about that any contingent state of\naffairs obtains. However, the following list of contingent states of\naffairs shows that there can be contingent states of affairs that an\nomnipotent agent is powerless to bring about, and hence that this\nsimple analysis is inadequate:\n\nthat a raindrop fell;\nthat a raindrop falls at \\(t\\) (where \\(t\\)\nis a past time);\nthat Parmenides lectures for the first time;\nthat the Amazon River floods an odd number of times less than\nfour;\nthat a snowflake falls and no omnipotent agent ever exists;\nand\nthat Plato freely decides to write a dialogue.\n\n\nNote that (a) is a past state of affairs. Presumably, it is not\npossible for an efficient cause to occur later than its\neffect. However, an agent\u2019s bringing about a state of affairs is\na kind of efficient causation. Therefore, it is not possible for an\nagent to bring about anything that is in the past. In other\nwords, it is impossible for any agent to have power over what\nis past. Hence, no agent, not even an omnipotent one, can bring it\nabout that (a) obtains. Likewise, despite the fact that (b) can be\nbrought about prior to \\(t\\), the\nimpossibility of an agent\u2019s having power over what is past\nimplies that after t even an omnipotent agent cannot bring it\nabout that (b) obtains. In the case of (c), prior to\nParmenides\u2019s first lecture, an omnipotent agent can bring about\n(c). But once Parmenides has lectured, even an omnipotent agent cannot\nbring it about that (c) obtains. As for (d), prior to the\nAmazon\u2019s third flooding, an omnipotent agent can bring it about\nthat (d) obtains, while after the Amazon\u2019s third flooding, even\nan omnipotent agent cannot bring it about that (d) obtains. (e)\nintroduces a special difficulty. Although it is obvious that (e) could\nnot be brought about by an omnipotent agent, it can be argued\nplausibly that it is possible for a non-omnipotent agent to\nbring about (e) by causing a snowflake to fall, provided that\nno omnipotent agent ever\n exists.[1]\n But, as we argued earlier, a maximally powerful being need not have\nthe power to bring about every state of affairs that any other being\ncould. Lastly, while if the libertarian theory of free will is\ncorrect, an omnipotent agent (who is, of course, other than\nPlato) cannot bring about (f), apparently a non-omnipotent agent,\nnamely, Plato, can bring it about that (f) obtains.\n\nConsequently, a satisfactory analysis of omnipotence ought not to\nrequire that an omnipotent agent have the power to bring about (a),\n(b), (c), (d), (e), or (f), if it is assumed, arguendo, in\nthe case of (f), that libertarianism is true.\n\nBecause of the wide disparity among contingent states of affairs,\n(a)\u2013(f), one might despair of finding an analysis of omnipotence\nthat both deals satisfactorily with all of these states of affairs and\nimplies that an omnipotent being has, intuitively speaking, sufficient\npower. Is such pessimism warranted, or is omnipotence analyzable?\n\nThere are at least two approaches to analyzing omnipotence that hold\nout some hope of success. The first utilizes the notion of an\nunrestrictedly repeatable state of affairs, and the second\nutilizes the notion of two worlds sharing their histories up to a\ntime. Although these approaches to analyzing omnipotence differ\nin important ways, they are in broad agreement on the leading idea\nthat maximal power has logical and temporal limitiations, including\nthe limitation that an omnipotent agent cannot bring about, i.e.,\ncause, another agent\u2019s free decision in the libertarian sense.\nIn the following two sections, some recent instances of these\napproaches are set forth and compared.\n",
