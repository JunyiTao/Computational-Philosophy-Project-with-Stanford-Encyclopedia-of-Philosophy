    "main_text": "Isaac Israeli\u2019s Philosophical Sources\n2. Isaac Israeli\u2019s Philosophical Sources\n\nRegrettably, in his surviving treatises, Israeli does not discuss his\nphilosophical studies. We do know that by Isaac Israeli\u2019s\nlifetime, several Greek books of philosophy translated into Arabic as\nwell as original Arabic philosophical works were available, though\nperhaps some of these treatises, mostly produced in Baghdad and its\nenvirons, had not yet journeyed westward to North Africa. Much of\nAristotle\u2019s corpus had been translated in the previous century,\nas had Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge, often studied as an\nintroduction to Aristotle\u2019s works. Further, an Arabic partial\nparaphrase of Plotinus\u2019 Enneads circulated under the\npseudepigraphic title The Theology of Aristotle in two\nrecensions, the shorter of which is called the Vulgate Theology of\nAristotle (due to its larger number of manuscripts) while the\nother recension is called the Longer Theology of Aristotle.\nThere are both significant parallels and significant variances between\nIsraeli\u2019s writings and the Longer Theology of\nAristotle. Thus, the influences of Aristotle and Plotinus on\nIsraeli\u2019s philosophy are strong, and he likely read translations\nof their works as well as commentaries on them.\n\nS.M. Stern argues for the existence of a lost pseudepigraphic Arabic\ntreatise which influenced the longer recension of The Theology of\nAristotle and Isaac Israeli, and was quoted without proper\nattribution by both. Further, he argues that this same treatise is\nidentical to a philosophical excursus which was appended to the\nliterary tale The Tale of the Prince and the Ascetic (Hebrew:\nSefer ben ha-melech veha-nazir) when Abraham Ibn Hasday\ntranslated the text from Arabic (Bilawhar wa-Yudasaf) into\nHebrew in the thirteenth century. Although one may be tempted to\nconjecture that the Neoplatonist appendix is an original work by Ibn\nHasday which largely paraphrases Israeli\u2014a hypothesis\nstrengthened by the fact that Ibn Hasday had translated\nIsraeli\u2019s Book of the Elements\u2014Stern disproves\nthis possibility by demonstrating that Israeli\u2019s Book of\nSubstances is largely a commentary on the metaphysics of Ibn\nHasday\u2019s treatise, and Israeli\u2019s Book on Spirit and\nthe Soul is an attempt to reconcile Ibn Hasday\u2019s treatise\nwith scriptural proof texts. Hence, according to Altmann and Stern,\nIsraeli was strongly influenced by this treatise they call \u201cIbn\nHasday\u2019s Neoplatonist.\u201d Further, we know that Israeli did\nnot author this treatise, for when he quoted it, he cited \u201cthe\nphilosopher,\u201d thereby indicating that he thought he was quoting\nAristotle.\n\nMore recently, Fritz Zimmerman has argued that Stern\u2019s\nhypothesis of an otherwise unattested \u201cNeoplatonist\u201d as\nsource for Israeli is superfluous. Israeli\u2019s source may have\nbeen the Longer Theology of Aristotle, while Ibn\nHasday\u2019s source may simply have been Israeli, either\nsynthesizing the view\u2019s in Israeli\u2019s extant treatises, or\nparaphrasing a lost treatise of Israeli\u2019s. In the absence of\nfurther documentary evidence, neither Stern\u2019s nor\nZimmerman\u2019s theory can be definitively ruled out.\n\nIsaac Israeli\u2019s passages on intellection, interpreted by Stern\nas a misreading of al-Kindi, actually mirrors a passage in John of\nDamascus\u2019 (c. 676\u2013c. 749) De Fide Orthodoxa,\nwhich was translated into Arabic in the tenth century (Wolfson, 1961:\n279\u2013280). While it is within the realm of possibility that\nIsraeli read this translation, it is also possible that both authors\nare citing a previous source which is no longer extant.\n\nA clear and strong influence of the Arab philosopher al-Kindi (d. 873)\nis evident in the work of Isaac Israeli. Like the former, he wrote a\nbook of definitions, many of which are strongly similar to definitions\nin al-Kindi\u2019s Fi Hudud al-ashya\u2019 wa-rusumiha.\nScholars Altmann and Stern illustrate the extensive similarities\nbetween the two books in their commentary on Israeli\u2019s Book\nof Definitions in their study Isaac Israeli: A Neoplatonic\nPhilosopher of the Early Tenth Century. Further, Israeli uses\nmuch of al-Kindi\u2019s terminology for both astronomical and\nterrestrial objects. Nonetheless, it would be wrong to call the book a\nparaphrase of al-Kindi, as there are numerous divergences as well.\n\nThough we see overlap with The Theology of Aristotle and\nal-Kindi, we do not have any evidence that Israeli read the works of\nhis younger contemporary al-Farabi (ca. 870\u2013ca. 950), nor do we\nsee the influence of his younger coreligionist philosopher Saadya Gaon\n(882\u2013942 C.E.).\n",
