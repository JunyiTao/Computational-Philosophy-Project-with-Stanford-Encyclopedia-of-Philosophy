Frege\u2019s Theory of Extensions: Basic Law V\n\nThough the present section is not required for understanding the proof\nof Frege\u2019s Theorem, we include it so that the reader can get\nsome sense of how second-order logic (with comprehension) gives rise\nto Russell\u2019s paradox when one adds Frege\u2019s theory of\ncourses-of-values and extensions. Though we shall briefly discuss\nFrege\u2019s notation for courses-of-values, we\u2019ll subsequently\nswitch to simpler notation for naming the extensions of concepts. For\nthe purposes of this section, let us suppose that we have primitive\nfunction terms \\(f\\), \\(g\\), \\(h\\), \u2026 in our language and that\nfunctional applications such as \\(f(x)\\), \\(g(y)\\), etc., are\nallowed.\n\nThe principle that undermined Frege\u2019s system, Basic Law V, was\none that attempted to systematize the notions \u2018course-of-values\nof a function\u2019 and \u2018extension of a concept\u2019. The\ncourse-of-values of a function \\(f\\) is something like a set of\nordered pairs that records the value \\(f(x)\\) for every argument \\(\nx\\). For example, the course-of-values of the function father of\nx records, among other things, that Bill Clinton is the value of\nthe function when Chelsea Clinton is the argument. The\ncourse-of-values for the function \\(x^2\\) records, among other things,\nthat the number 4 is the value when the number 2 is the argument, that\n9 is the value when 3 is the argument, etc. When a function \\(f\\) is a\nconcept, Frege called the course-of-values for that concept its\nextension. The extension of a concept is something like the\nset of all objects that fall under the concept, for the extension\nrecords all of the objects that the concept maps to The True. For\nexample, the extension of the concept \\(x\\) is a positive even\ninteger less than 8 is something like the set consisting of the\nnumbers 2, 4, and 6.\n",
