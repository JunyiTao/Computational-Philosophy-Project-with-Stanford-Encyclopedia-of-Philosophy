    "main_text": "A Brief History of Descartes\u2019 Scientific Work || Suggested Readings\n1.2 Suggested Readings\n\nFor recent in-depth examinations of Descartes\u2019 physics, see\nGarber 1992a and Des Chene 1996. Schuster 2014 covers Descartes\u2019\nearly physics, from 1618 to 1633. A concise survey of Cartesian\nphysics can be found in Garber 1992b. The scientific career of\nDescartes, with special emphasis on his physics, is presented in Shea\n1991; see also Gaukroger, Schuster, Sutton 2000 for the many aspects\nof his natural philosophy. Gaukroger 2002 examines the Principles\nof Philosophy, especially the physics, whereas Slowik 2002\nfocuses primarily on Cartesian space and relational motion. The\nhistorical background to much in Descartes\u2019 physics is also\ntreated in Ariew 2011. On methodology in Descartes\u2019 natural\nphilosophy, see Smith 2009, while Hattab 2009 and Machamer and McGuire\n2009 cover the development of various ideas important to his physics.\nOn the reception of Descartes\u2019 work and early forms of\nCartesianism, with special attention devoted to physics, see Schmaltz\n2005, 2017, and Dobre 2017.\n",
