    "main_text": "The Birth of Collapse Theories\n4. The Birth of Collapse Theories\n\nThe debate on the macro-objectification problem continued for many\nyears after the early days of quantum mechanics. In the early 1950s an\nimportant step was taken by D. Bohm who presented (Bohm 1952) a\nmathematically precise deterministic completion of quantum mechanics\n(see the entry on Bohmian Mechanics), which was anticipated by de\nBroglie in the 1920s. In the area of Collapse Theories, one should\nmention the contribution by Bohm and Bub (1966), which was based on\nthe interaction of the statevector with Wiener-Siegel hidden\nvariables. But let us come to Collapse Theories in the sense currently\nattached to this expression. \n\nImportant investigations during the 1970s can be considered as\npreliminary steps for the subsequent developments. In the years 1970\nthe school of L. Fonda in Italy concerned with quantum decay processes\nand in particular with the possibility of deriving, within a quantum\ncontext, the exponential decay law (Fonda, Ghirardi, and Rimini 1978).\nSome features of this approach turned out to be relevant for the\nsubsequent development of Collapse Theories:\n\nThe focus is on individual physical systems, not ensembles;\nThe statevector is supposed to undergo random processes at random\ntimes, inducing sudden changes, which drive it either within the\nlinear manifold of the unstable state or within that of the decay\nproducts;\nTo make the treatment quite general (the apparatus is insensitive\nof which kind of unstable system it is testing) one is led to identify\nthe random processes with localization processes of the relative\ncoordinates of the decay fragments. Such an assumption, combined with\nthe peculiar resonant dynamics characterizing an unstable system,\nyields, completely in general, the desired result. The \u2018relative\nposition basis\u2019 is the preferred basis of this theory;\nAnalogous ideas have been applied to measurement processes;\nThe final equation for the evolution at the ensemble level is of\nthe quantum dynamical semigroup type and has a structure extremely\nsimilar to the final equation of the GRW theory.\n\n\nObviously, in these papers the considered reduction processes were not\nassumed to be \u2018spontaneous and fundamental\u2019 natural\nprocesses, but due to system- environment interactions. Accordingly,\nthese attempts did not represent original proposals for solving the\nmacro-objectification problem, yet they have paved the way for the\nelaboration of the GRW theory. \n\nAround the same years, P. Pearle (1976, 1979), and subsequently N.\nGisin (1984a,b) and Diosi (1988), had developed models which accounted\nfor the reduction process in terms of stochastic differential\nequations. While they were looking for a new dynamical equation\noffering a solution to the macro-objectification problem, they did not\nsucceed in identifying the states to which the dynamical equation\nshould lead. The these states were assumed to depend on the particular\nmeasurement process one was considering, leaving the program of\nformulating a universal dynamics accounting for the quantum properties\nof microscopic systems together the classical properties of\nmacroscopic objects incomplete. In those years N. Gisin formulated\nsubsequently an interesting argument (Gisin 1989) according to which\nnonlinear modifications of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in general\nare unacceptable, since they imply the possibility of sending\nsuperluminal signals. This argument eventually proved that only a very\nspecific class of nonlinear (and stochastic) modifications of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation is physically acceptable (Caiaffa, Smirne\n& Bassi 2017, and references therein), the class which collapse\nmodels belong to.\n",
