    "main_text": "Libertarian Paternalism || Normative Issues\n4.2 Normative Issues\n\nGiven that nudges are not coercive, that they are intended to promote\nthe good of individuals as they themselves perceive that good, that\nthey have been shown to often be effective, are there any plausible\nnormative objections to their use?\n\nAs with any policy intervention, either by the state or by private\norganizations, there are possible misuses to worry about. Perhaps\nthere are slippery-slopes to be avoided. Perhaps proponents of nudging\nover-estimate the amount and seriousness of faulty reasoning by\nagents; mistakes that nudgers wish to harness to promote the agents\nwelfare. Perhaps they are mistaken about what agents really value when\nthey claim people prefer health to more sugary beverages.\n\nBut these objections are not objections to nudging but to the misuse\nof this type of behavioral intervention. Are there objections to the\nvery nature of nudging itself?\n\nThere is one feature of many nudges that must be considered which,\nalthough not intrinsic to the concept of a nudge, is often present in\nthe background as a crucial feature. One author actually links these\nbackground conditions to the definition of Libertarian\nPaternalism.\n\n\nLibertarian Paternalism is the set of interventions aimed at\novercoming the unavoidable cognitive biases and decisional\ninadequacies of an individual by exploiting them in such a way as to\ninfluence her decisions (in an easily reversible manner) towards the\nchoices she herself would make under idealised conditions. (Rebanato\n2012: 6) \n\n\nAn example of this use of cognitive biases is changing opt-in to\nopt-out. It is because of cognitive bias to doing nothing to change\nthe status quo that there are relatively fewer opt-outs than might be\nexpected.\n\nGiven this background, there are at least three objections that have\nobjected to features intrinsic to some\u2014by no means\nall\u2014nudges. The first is that nudging often occurs without the\nnudged being aware they are being nudged. The second is that nudging\noften works by harnessing defects in the thinking of those being\nnudged. The third is that some nudges (besides those subject to the\nfirst two objections) are forms of objectionable manipulation.\n",
