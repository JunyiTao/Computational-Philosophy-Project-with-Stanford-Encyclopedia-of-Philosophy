    "main_text": "The evidence from bodies that the sexes have different natures || Temperature\n5.1 Temperature\n\nTemperature, on Marinella\u2019s view, is the physical cause (the\nmaterial cause) of the superiority of women\u2019s souls: \n\n\nit is necessary that I should clarify to some extent the nature of the\nbody, because nearly all of its virtues and defects depend on its\ntemperature, so that reason, even though it is master, is frequently\ndazzled and blinded by the senses. (1601b, 77)\n\n\nThe right, moderate, temperature, will ensure that reason is not\nblinded by the senses, and hence will allow reason to retain control\nover desire; and moderate temperature is, on Marinella\u2019s\naccount, most often found in women. The philosophical foundation for\nthe claim that the temperature of women\u2019s bodies is a sign of\ntheir virtue is an interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s natural\nphilosophy. (It is possible that she also had Galen in mind.)\nMarinella claims that the lower temperature of women\u2019s bodies\ncauses them to have superior moral virtues, and in this she is\noriginal; Castiglione had argued that women were more temperate\nphysiologically, but he did not draw the connection to moral\ntemperance so explicitly (see Castiglione 1528, 219). Marinella\nreports that Aristotle says that women are \u201cLess hot than men\nand therefore more imperfect and less noble,\u201d (130). She agrees\nwith Aristotle that relative to men women are cooler in temperature,\nbut she disagrees that women are cold in absolute terms. She then\ndevelops an argument that demonstrates, in part by pointing out\ndiscrepancies in Aristotle\u2019s own account of the effects of heat\nand cold on certain soul functions, that the relative coolness of the\nfemale is a moral, and ultimately an intellectual, advantage.\n\nAristotle believed that the fundamental difference between male and\nfemale animals was a different capacity to concoct excess blood in the\nbody into semen through a process that involved the transmission of\nheat to the blood; ultimately this difference was caused by a\ndifference in heat, or the capacity to transmit heat, in the hearts of\nmales and females (Marinella cites History of Animals IX, but\nthere is considerable evidence for this view in the Generation of\nAnimals as well; see, for example GA IV. 1 766a31\u20136). That\nis, the distinction between male and female animals resides in their\nheart, which is the source of natural heat, such that women are less\ncapable of producing vital heat.\n\nAristotle consistently says that animals that are more intelligent\nhave the \u201cpurest\u201d blood; and more generally, he asserts\nthat the quality of blood affects the intelligence and temperament of\nanimals (see, e.g., Generation of Animals 2.6\n744a28\u201332, Parts of Animals 2.4 650b19\u201325,\n651a12\u201316). Moreover, Aristotle suggests that these differences\nin blood occur not only across animal species, but also between the\nsexes in a species. His claim is that hot, thin, pure blood is best,\nbecause such blood correlates both with courage (manliness) and with\npractical wisdom (Parts of Animals II. 2 748a2\u201314). The\nimplication is clearly that those animals that benefit from hot, thin,\npure blood are superior both with respect to deliberative reasoning\nand with respect to the moral virtue of courage. So men, in virtue of\ntheir body temperature, have an advantage, both intellectual and\nmoral, over women.\n\nBut Aristotle\u2019s views on the effects of temperature on the\nblood, and through the blood on the soul\u2019s faculties, present\ncertain challenges of interpretation: in the same passage of the\nParts of Animals just cited, Aristotle says first that cold,\nthin blood is best for intelligence, and then that hot, thin blood is\nbest. Marinella exploits this ambiguity, elaborating on\nCastiglione\u2019s point that women are, in themselves, temperate\nrather than cold (see Castiglione 1528, 219). She agrees that women\nare colder, and embraces the notion that cold blood is intelligent\nblood. But she goes further than Castiglione in asserting that hot\nblood is associated with intemperate passions, and deduces the\nsuperiority of women with respect to intelligence, temperance, and\ngeneral virtue or nobility. She says,\n\n\nI now believe that Aristotle did not consider the workings of heat\nwith a mature mind, nor what it signifies to be more or less hot, nor\nwhat good and bad effects derive from this. (1601b, 130) \n\n\nShe links here maturity with femininity, and femininity with relative\ncoldness of temperature, thus extending the claim that cold blood\nsupports greater intelligence to the claim that cold blood supports\nsuperior moral strength, by claiming that cooler blood encourages\ntemperance with respect to pleasure and desire. Passi, and other\nopponents of women, accused women of intemperance, lasciviousness, and\ninconstancy; Marinella argues in response that the cooler temperature\nwomen enjoy allows them to keep their desires in check so that they\ncan reason more effectively than men, who are over-heated relative to\nwomen.\n\nThe degree of heat in a living body affects directly the specific\ncharacter of the operations of the soul, making, for example,\nreasoning or desiring more or less principled, or more or less\nimpulsive. Marinella asserts (citing Plutarch as her authority) that\n\u201cheat is an instrument of the soul,\u201d (1601b, 130). That\nis, the soul will operate in some instances through the mechanism of\nheat; the soul must use the body\u2019s heat as an instrument to\nconduct its operations\u2014where those operations are not only\nrational activities, but are also the operations of desire and\nappetite. Now, since these operations of the soul affect in turn the\nactions that a person takes, the effects of body temperature extend\nbeyond the direct effects on the activities of the soul, to the\nchoices and actions the person takes, causing them to be virtuous or\nvicious. This is borne out by what Marinella says about the relation\nbetween temperate body heat and both moral and intellectual virtues.\n\u201cLittle and failing heat, as in old people, is powerless for the\nsoul\u2019s operations,\u201d whereas excessive heat \u201cmakes\nsouls precipitous and unbridled,\u201d (1601b, 130). So insufficient\nheat makes the soul\u2019s operations (cognitive and moral)\nineffectual, but excessive heat makes the soul\u2019s operations\nunprincipled and impulsive. Now, the effects of insufficient or\nexcessive heat are deeds, good or bad. Insufficient heat will lead to\ninaction, and excessive heat will lead to vicious action.\n\nIn response, then, to Passi and Aristotle, Marinella concedes the\nempirical point, that women are colder but (i) disputes that women are\ncolder absolutely (because, as Castiglione pointed out, temperature is\nrelative, and hence women might be colder than men and yet temperate\n\u2018in themselves\u2019), and (ii) disputes the relation between\nheat and nobility, first citing various examples of those who are\nhotter than, but not nobler than, some others. She points out that\nregional climactic differences historically considered to affect body\ntemperature exceed and confound sex differences\u2014so African and\nSpanish women will be hotter than German men. If, as Marinella\u2019s\nopponents believe, greater heat necessarily leads to greater virtue,\nthen they should concede that African women will be more virtuous than\nGerman men. But those who argue that women are less noble than men\nbecause they have less heat than men, will not allow that men living\nin colder climates are less noble than women living in warmer\nclimates. So they should abandon the general principle that heat\ncorrelates with greater nobility. Moreover, Marinella claims that some\nindividuals will have had \u2018natures\u2019 hotter than Plato and\nAristotle (it is not clear what the evidence for this is, but it is\nclear that she supposes there is some independent measure of heat\nother than virtue). And she assumes we can all agree that no one has\never been more virtuous than Plato and Aristotle. So, once again, her\nopponents must concede that it is not a universal truth that greater\nheat leads to greater virtue. We might expect Marinella, having\ndisputed the relation between heat and nobility, to abandon any\nattempt to argue that women are superior to men in virtue of their\nbody temperature. But she does not acknowledge an inconsistency in\narguing both that there is no correlation between greater heat and\ngreater virtue and that women are superior because they are colder. If\none were to object to her argument that men who live in colder\nclimates ought to be cooler than women who live in warmer climates,\nand therefore better than those women, she would reply that those men\nhad effectively become women:\n\n\n\u2026if a man performs excellent deeds it is because his nature is\nsimilar to a woman\u2019s, possessing temperate but not excessive\nheat, and because his years of virile maturity have tempered the\nfervor of that heat he possessed in his youth and made his nature more\nfeminine so that it operates with greater wisdom and maturity. (1601b,\n131)\n\n\nThis suggests also that in those places where women become hotter\nbecause of the climate, they will become worse\u2014but not relative\nto men who live in the same climate. If there is a correlation between\nlower body temperature and virtue, and one allows that in warmer\nclimates everyone will have a higher body temperature, but that women\nwill generally have a lower body temperature than men in the same\nclimate, then women will be more virtuous than men in any given\nregion.\n\nMarinella argues, then, that Aristotle was correct to conclude that\nwomen are usually, if not always, cooler than men, but she insists\nthat women are temperate rather than cold. She then links, causally,\nthe physical state of a cooler body temperature with a capacity to\nexecute the soul\u2019s operations with sufficient force, but without\nexcessive passion: those who are physically temperate are also\npsychologically and morally temperate. When men succeed in virtuous\ndeeds, it will be because they have become more feminine\u2014more\nmoderate in temperature\u2014often with maturity, which Marinella\nassumes brings with it moderation in temperature. If women are\n(generally) the right temperature for virtue, and men are (generally)\nhotter than women, then clearly men are too hot. Moreover, there is\nindependent evidence for men\u2019s excessive heat in their actions,\nin particular in the intemperance they exhibit and the passionate love\nthey indulge in. The greater nobility of women\u2019s moral character\nallows them to perform more noble intellectual acts, because of the\nrelation between desire and intellect. A person has a better character\nwhen the faculty of desire submits willingly to the faculty of reason.\nAnd when that is the case, reason is freer to exercise its own\nfunctions, without interference from desire. So the nobler moral\ncharacter of women permits their intellects to focus on rational\nactivities, without the distraction of having to control unbridled or\nmistaken desires. This accounts for the greater intellectual ability,\nas well as the superior moral character, that Marinella attributes to\nwomen.\n",
