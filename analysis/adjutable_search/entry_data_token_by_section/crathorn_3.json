    "main_text": "Philosophy of Language\n4. Philosophy of Language\n\nOne of the most important debates at Oxford around 1320\u201330\nconcerned the proper object of scientific knowledge. When we know\nsomething scientifically, is our knowledge about external things (the\nearth interposed between the sun and the moon), propositions\n(\u2018The moon is eclipsed\u2019), or some other more complex state\nof affairs? Crathorn is believed to have participated in the\ndevelopment of the idea that the proper object of science is neither\nthe external thing nor the proposition (as Ockham and Holkot had\nargued), but the \u2018total significate\u2019 of that proposition\n(Tachau 1987). Typically, the total significate would include not only\nexternal things but also the premises and other assumptions that\ngenerate our assent to the proposition as the conclusion of a piece of\ndemonstrative reasoning.\n\nAnother debate concerned the nature of mental language, specifically\nwhether it is conventional or natural (Gelber 1984; Panaccio 1996)\nOckham had argued that thinking occurs in a universal language made of\nconcepts acquired naturally, i.e. through natural relations of\ncausality and similitude. All conventional languages used for human\ncommunication are subordinated to this mental language, which is\nshared by everyone. But Crathorn could not accept such a position\nbecause of his cognitive theory according to which there are only\nqualities in the mind. So there can be natural signs of extra-mental\nqualities. What about substance-terms (the equivalent of proper and\ncommon names), verbs, and syncategorems, i.e., logical particles and\nconnectives such as \u2018or\u2019, \u2018but\u2019,\n\u2018all\u2019, and \u2018if\u2019? Accordingly, Crathorn argues\nthat except for natural signs of qualities, no natural likeness in the\nmind can explain the signification of these terms. Mental language is\ntherefore as conventional as spoken and written languages and is in\nfact derived from conventional languages (I Sent., q. 2; Cf.\nPanaccio 1996, Perler 1997, Robert 2009b and 2010b). Just as thought\ndepends on the species or likenesses of external things,\nmental words are likenesses of conventional words and have exactly the\nsame semantic properties. Depending upon which language(s) you learn\nto speak, your mental language will be a likeness of Latin, English,\nFrench, etc. This does not mean that we do not have natural\nrepresentations of the external world, but these mental\nqualia do not form a language. Crathorn was the only thinker\nof his time to affirm that conventional words are prior to their\nmental counterparts. Meaning is first given by a community of\nspeakers; mental language is simply the internalization of these\nspoken and written languages. When we think about the world with\npropositions and syllogisms, we always think in a conventional\nlanguage or, more precisely, in its mental reflection.\n",
