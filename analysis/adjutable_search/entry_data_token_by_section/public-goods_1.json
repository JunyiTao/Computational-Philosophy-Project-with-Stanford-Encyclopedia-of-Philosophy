    "main_text": "Defining Public Goods and Distinguishing Between Different Kinds of Public Goods || Porous Boundaries\n1.2 Porous Boundaries\n\nThe boundaries between these different types of goods are neither\nsharp nor fixed. For example, whether or not Bob\u2019s enjoyment of\na movie in a theatre is affected by Sally\u2019s watching the movie\nin the same theatre at the same time depends on Bob\u2019s values or\ntastes as well as details of the context. Sally might sit in front of\nBob and partially block his view. Or she might be one of those people\nwho sits right next to you even though fifty other seats are\navailable. Or Bob might be bothered by anyone sitting in the same\ntheatre at the same time, or enjoy watching the movie together with\nothers. Thus, even supposing that Sally doesn\u2019t alter\nBob\u2019s viewing of the movie as such, her presence can have a\npositive or negative effect on Bob\u2019s enjoyment of it. Thus,\nwhether or not a good is rivalrous in consumption depends on many\ncontextual details and not just the nature of the good alone.\n\nThe same good can be excludable at one time, but non-excludable at\nanother, or excludable in one society, but non-excludable in another.\nFor example, radio broadcasts used to be a public good because it was\nnot (easily) possible to prevent individuals from tuning in, but this\nis no longer the case in the digital age. But technology is only part\nof the story. A particular plot of land\u2014a prime example of a\nprivate good\u2014can be protected by building a fence around it. But\nthere is no fence that cannot be overcome. In reality, a fence is more\nlike a signal indicating that the owner prefers to keep others out, or\nit makes it more costly for them to do so. What matters for the\ncharacterisation of land as a private good is that the landowner has\nthe right to stop potential trespassers and that this right\nwill be enforced by the legal system. Of course, which sets of rights\nare attached to property depends on the norms prevailing in a society.\nProperty rights are never absolute (property in a chain saw gives me\nthe right to use it to cut my own trees but not to cut my\nneighbour\u2019s trees, much less to use it to hurt anyone), and\nalways the result of past negotiations.\n\nTo give a silly example, not everyone enjoys the sight of\n(particularly, white) socks in sandals. In our society, the sight of\nsocks in sandals is something individuals have to endure because it is\nconsidered to be within the rights of the owners of white socks that\nthey can wear them in public, in sandals or in other types of shoes.\nIt is easy, however, to imagine societies that define the rights of\nsock-owners differently and value the tastes of those who are bothered\nby the blight of socks in sandals more highly. Indeed, even in modern\nliberal societies social norms regulate what is decent to wear in\npublic. Since a good\u2019s degree of excludability depends in part\non property rights, and what property rights entail may differ between\nsocieties and, within societies, may change over time, a good\u2019s\nexcludability may differ between societies and change over time. \n\nAnother, related aspect is that the cost of enforcing property rights\ndiffers between cases, partly for technological, partly for legal and\npolitical reasons. That automobiles are private goods depends on the\nrelatively cheap availability of suitable locks and also on the fact\nthat the government enforces property rights in automobiles. If the\nprice of locks were higher, or the government made it illegal to\nsecure one\u2019s car using a lock, or the government stopped\nprosecuting theft, automobiles would be \u201cnon-excludable\u201d\n(Demsetz 1964).\n\nA corollary of the non-excludability characteristic is that there are\nlimitations to consumers\u2019 consumption decisions regarding the\npublic good, if it is produced. Individuals might have different\npreferences for the level of security provided by national defence,\nbut once national defence is in place, they will consume the level\nthat has been produced, not more or less of it. One cannot \u201copt\nout\u201d of the consumption of a public good. Similarly, while\neveryone might like clean air, individuals will differ in their degree\nof tolerance of pollution. But once \u201cclean air\u201d has been\nproduced, consumers must consume it independently of their\npreferences.\n\nIt has been suggested that the \u201cpublic\u201d nature of a public\ngood may be an effect of its provision by the public rather\nthan its cause (Cowen 1992: 6 credits unpublished work from 1987 by\nBoudewijn Bouckaert). If a good is provided by government, private actors\nhave no reason to develop technologies that allow the exclusion of\nnon-paying individuals. Accordingly, public investment in the good\nthereby makes a good that could be private a public good. Even if this\nidea is mistaken, it illustrates the fact that the boundary between\nprivate and public goods is not fixed because what is technologically\npossible depends in part on investment in research and\ndevelopment.\n\nThe physical characteristics of a good, then, together with the\ncontext of its consumption, values, tastes, legal, moral and social\nnorms as well as technological possibilities determine the proper\ncategorisation of a good as a private, common pool, club, or public\ngood.\n",
