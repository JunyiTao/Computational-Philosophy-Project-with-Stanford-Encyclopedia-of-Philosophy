    "main_text": "Moral Phenomenology and Normative Ethics || Atomism vs. holism\n3.4 Further issues\n\nTwo further issues in normative ethics that deserve mention, if only\nbriefly, are these.\n\nRegarding three of the most prominent types of ethical\ntheory\u2014consequentialism, deontology, and virtue\nethics\u2014phenomenological considerations specific to each can help\nilluminate them. Some versions of consequentialism hold that pleasure\nand pain have positive and negative value respectively that figure in\ndetermining the deontic status of actions. Since these experiences\narguably have a phenomenological element to them, one can expect\nphenomenological analysis to help explain the value they do have.\nTaking a Kantian view as a model of deontology with the emphasis on\nrespect for persons, the phenomenology of respect for persons will\nbear importantly in fully illuminating this kind of theory (see\nDrummond 2006, Kriegel 2018, Kriegel & Timmons 2021) And, we have\nalready noted work on the phenomenology of virtue (Annas 2008) that\ncan be brought to bear on virtue ethics. (These points are taken from\nKriegel 2019).\n\nMoreover, as touched upon above in\n section 2.2\n and\n section 2.5,\n Phenomenologists go beyond mere description of the feelings or\nemotions as apprehending value to bring their analyses to bear on\nnormative issues. While some, for example, Levinas, adopt a\nstraightforward deontic approach, others who adopt an axiological\napproach also address the normative. Recall that for Scheler the\nfeeling-apprehension of the ideal, a priori value motivates\n(in an unspecified manner) the awareness of a moral ought-to-do that\nwill instantiate the value. Hence, we can think of such thinkers as\ndeontologists. Others, however, who adopt a weaker version of value\nrealism move in the direction of virtue ethics and an aretaic, rather\nthan deontic, conception of \u201cright\u201d action.\nHusserl\u2019s notion of \u201cabsolute loves\u201d as generating\n\u201cabsolute oughts\u201d is a case in point. The mother\u2019s\nabsolute love generates an \u201cought\u201d in the sense that the\nmother feels she must do her \u201cbest\u201d for the child.\nIt\u2019s the right action insofar as it is the best action available\nrather than a deontic demand. Drummond (2006, 2010), while claiming\nthat respect imposes obligations upon an agent, nevertheless locates\nrespect within a eudaimonistic, virtue framework, and Irene McMullin\n(2019) develops an account of the virtues that incorporates\nfirst-person, second-person, and third-person perspectives.\n\nFinally, phenomenological evidence has been brought to bear on the\nvarious roles that morally relevant reasons for action might\nplay. Dwelling on the controversial category of the supererogatory,\nHorgan and Timmons (2010a) argue that making sense of the\nsupererogatory as it is normally experienced requires recognizing that\nin addition to such reasons playing requiring and justifying roles\n(Gert 2004), we must recognize what they call a\n\u201cmerit-conferring\u201d role for reasons\u2014reasons that\nmorally favor a course of action without prima facie\nrequiring it, let alone requiring it all-things-considered.\nConclusion\n\nThere has been a growing tendency on the part of philosophers to put\naside the distinction between \u201cContinental\u201d and analytic\nphilosophy and to focus on problems of common concern. This\ndevelopment is perhaps most evident in the philosophy of mind. See,\nfor example, Shaun Gallagher and Dan Zahavi\u2019s The\nPhenomenological Mind (2012), which situates Phenomenology in\nrelation to the analytic philosophy of mind and the cognitive\nsciences. Think, too, of the recent explosion in the study of the\nemotions. We have mentioned a number of moral phenomenologists who\nexplore the emotions, and their work involves dialogue with others\nworking on the emotions who do not explore their moral dimension.\nDrummond and Rinofner-Kreidl\u2019s (2018) collection on emotional\nexperiences, for example, has brought together Phenomenological and\nanalytic philosophers of mind. More important, if you look at the list\nof references in the separate articles, almost all of them cite\nauthors from multiple traditions. Conversely, analytic philosophers of\nmind are looking to Phenomenological thinkers and to new possibilities\nfor conceiving moral experience. The work outlined in this\ncontribution is an instance of these more inclusive approaches and\nsuggests an agenda for further research.\n",
