    "main_text": "New approaches to fallacies || The formal approach to informal fallacies\n3.4 The formal approach to informal fallacies\n\nJohn Woods also despairs of the standard treatment but he sees in it\nsomething of importance; namely that the fallacies most often reviewed\nin introductory level logic textbooks \u201care a kind of caricature\nof their associated improprieties, which lie deeply imbedded in human\npractice\u201d (Woods 1992, 25). The fallacies are then behavioural\nsymptoms of kinds of irrationality to which humans are highly\nsusceptible, and that makes them an important subject for study\nbecause they say something about human nature. Therefore, the problem\nwith the standard treatment, according to Woods, is not that it is a\nmisdirected research programme, but rather that it has been poorly\ncarried out, partly because logicians have failed to appreciate that a\nmulti-logical approach is necessary to understand the variety of\nfallacies. This idea, pursued jointly by Woods and Douglas Walton\n(1989), is that, for many of the fallacies standard formal logic is\ninadequate to uncover the unique kind of logical mistakes in\nquestion\u2014it is too coarse conceptually to reveal the unique\ncharacter of many of the fallacies. To get a satisfactory analysis of\neach of the fallacies they must be matched with a fitting logical\nsystem, one that has the facility to uncover the particular logical\nweakness in question. Inductive logic can be employed for analysis of\nhasty generalization and post hoc ergo propter hoc;\nrelatedness logic is appropriate for ignoratio elenchi;\nplausible reasoning theory for the ad verecundiam, and\ndialectical game theory for begging the question and many questions.\nWoods (1992, 43) refers to this approach to studying the fallacies as\nmethodological pluralism. Thus, like the informal logicians, there is\nhere an interest in getting the analyses of each of the fallacies\nright, but the Woods and Walton approach involves embracing formal\nmethods, not putting them aside.\n\nWoods (2013) has continued his research on fallacies, most recently\nconsidering them in the context of what he calls a naturalized logic\n(modelled on Quine\u2019s naturalized epistemology). The main point\nof this naturalizing move is that a theory of reasoning should take\ninto account the abilities and motivations of reasoners. Past work on\nthe fallacies has identified them as failing to satisfy the rules of\neither deductive or inductive logic, but Woods now wants to consider\nthe core fallacies in light of what he calls third-way reasoning\n(comparable to non-monotonic reasoning), an account of the cognitive\npractices that closely resemble our common inferential practices. From\nthe perspective of third-way reasoning the \u201crules\u201d implicit in the\nfallacies present themselves as heuristic directives to reasoners\nrather than as fallacies; hence, it may be that learning from feedback\n(having errors corrected) is less trouble than learning the rules to\navoid fallacies in the first place (Woods 2013, p. 215). Woods\nillustrates his point by recalling many of the fallacies he originally\nidentified in his 1992 paper, and subjecting them to this revised\nmodel of analysis thereby overturning the view that these types of\nargument are always to be spurned.\n",
