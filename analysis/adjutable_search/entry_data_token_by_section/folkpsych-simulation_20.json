    "main_text": "Simulation Theory: Pros and Cons || Self and Others\n6.2 Self and Others\n\nST\u2019s central claim is that we reuse our own cognitive\nmechanisms to arrive at a representation of other\npeople\u2019s mental states. This claim raises a number of issues\nconcerning how ST conceptualizes the self-other relation. We will\ndiscuss a couple of them.\n\nGallagher (2007: 355) writes that \n\n\ngiven the large diversity of motives, beliefs, desires, and behaviours\nin the world, it is not clear how a simulation process \u2026 can\ngive me a reliable sense of what is going on in the other\nperson\u2019s mind. \n\n\nThere are two ways of interpreting Gallagher\u2019s worry. First, it\ncan be read as saying that if mindreading is based on mental\nsimulation, then it is hard to see how mental state attributions could\nbe epistemically justified. This criticism, however, misses\nthe mark entirely, since ST is not concerned with whether mental state\nattributions count as knowledge, but only with how, as a matter of\nfact, we go about forming such attributions. A second way to\nunderstand Gallagher\u2019s remarks is this: as a matter of\nfact, we are pretty successful in understanding other minds;\nhowever, given the difference among individual minds, this pattern of\nsuccesses cannot be explained in terms of mental simulation.\n\nST has a two-tier answer to the second reading of Gallagher\u2019s\nchallenge. First, human beings are very similar with regard to\ncognitive processes such as perception, theoretical reasoning,\npractical reasoning, etc. For example, there is a very high\nprobability that if both you and I look at the same scene, we will\nhave the same visual experience. This explains why, in the large\nmajority of cases, I can reuse my visual mechanism to successfully\nsimulate your visual experiences. Second, even though we are quite\ngood at recognizing others\u2019 mental states, we are nonetheless\nprone to egocentric errors, i.e., we tend to attribute to a\ntarget the mental state that we would undergo if we were in\nthe target\u2019s situation, rather than the actual mental state the\ntarget is in (Goldman 2006). A standard example is the curse of\nknowledge bias, where we take for granted that other people know\nwhat we know (Birch & Bloom 2007). ST has a straightforward\nexplanation of such egocentric errors (Gordon 1995; Goldman 2006): if\nwe arrive at attributing mental states via mental simulation, the\nattribution accuracy will depend on our capacity to\n\u201cquarantine\u201d our genuine mental states, when they do not\nmatch the target\u2019s, and to replace them with more appropriate\nsimulated mental states. This \u201cadjustment\u201d process,\nhowever, is a demanding one, because our genuine mental states exert a\npowerful tendency. Thus, Gallagher is right when he says that, on some\noccasions, \u201cif I project the results of my own simulation onto\nthe other, I understand only myself in that other\u2019s situation,\nbut I don\u2019t understand the other\u201d (Gallagher 2007: 355).\nHowever, given how widespread egocentric errors are, this counts as a\npoint in favour of ST, rather than as an argument against it (but see\nde Vignemont & Mercier 2016, and Saxe 2005).\n\nCarruthers (1996, 2009, 2011) raises a different problem for ST: no\nversion of ST can adequately account for self-attributions of mental\nstates. Recall that, according to Goldman (2006), simulation-based\nmindreading is a three-stage process in which we first mentally\nsimulate a target\u2019s mental state, we then introspect\nand categorize the simulated mental state, and we finally attribute\nthe categorized state to the target. Since Goldman\u2019s model has\nit that attributions of mental states to others asymmetrically depend\non the ability to introspect one\u2019s own mental states, it\npredicts that: (A) introspection is (ontogenetically and\nphylogenetically) prior to the ability to represent others\u2019\nmental states; (B) there are cases in which introspection works just\nfine, but where the ability to represent others\u2019 mental states\nis impaired (presumably, because the mechanism responsible for\nprojecting one\u2019s mental states to the target is damaged).\nCarruthers (2009) argues that neither (A) nor (B) are borne out by the\ndata. The former because there are no creatures that have\nintrospective capacities but at the same time lack the ability to\nrepresent others\u2019 mental states; the latter because there are no\ndissociation cases in which an intact capacity for introspection is\npaired with an impairment in the ability to represent others\u2019\nmental states.\n\nHow might a Simulation Theorist respond to this objection? As we said\nin\n section 4,\n Gordon\u2019s (1986, 1995, 1996) Radical Simulationism does\nnot assign any role to introspection in mindreading. Rather, Gordon\nproposes that self-ascriptions are guided by ascent routines through\nwhich we answer the question \u201cDo I believe that p?\u201d\nby answering the lower-order question \u201cIs it the case that\np?\u201d Carruthers (1996, 2011) thinks that this won\u2019t\ndo either. Here is one of the many problems that Carruthers raises for\nthis suggestion\u2014we can call it \u201cThe Scope\nProblem\u201d: \n\n\nthis suggestion appears to have only a limited range of application.\nFor even if it works for the case of belief, it is very hard to see\nhow one might extend it to account for our knowledge of our own goals,\ndecisions, or intentions\u2014let alone our knowledge of our own\nattitudes of wondering, supposing, fearing, and so on. (Carruthers\n2011: 81)\n\n\nCarruthers\u2019 objections are important and deserve to be taken\nseriously. To discuss them, however, we would need to introduce a lot\nof further empirical evidence and many complex philosophical ideas\nabout self-knowledge. This is not a task that we can take up here (the\ninterested reader is encouraged to read, in addition to Gordon (2007)\nand Goldman (2009), the SEP entries on\n self-knowledge\n and on\n introspection).\n The take-home message should be clear enough nonetheless: anybody who\nputs forward an account of mindreading should remember that such an\naccount has to cohere with a plausible story about the cognitive\nmechanisms underlying self-attribution.\n",
