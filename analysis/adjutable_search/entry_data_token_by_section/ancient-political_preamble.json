    "main_text": "\n\nAncient political philosophy is understood here to mean ancient Greek\nand Roman thought from the classical period of Greek thought in the\nfifth century BCE to the end of the Roman empire in the West in the\nfifth century CE, excluding the development of Jewish and Christian\nideas about politics during that period. Political philosophy as a\ngenre was developed in this period by Plato and, in effect, reinvented\nby Aristotle: it encompasses reflections on the origin of political\ninstitutions, the concepts used to interpret and organize political\nlife such as justice and equality, the relation between the aims of\nethics and the nature of politics, and the relative merits of\ndifferent constitutional arrangements or regimes. Platonic models\nremained especially important for later authors throughout this\nperiod, even as the development of later \u201cHellenistic\u201d\nschools of Greek philosophy, and distinctively Roman forms of\nphilosophical adaptation, offered new frameworks for construing\npolitics from a philosophical point of view. Engagement in these Greek\nand Roman traditions of political philosophy among late antique\nscholars continued through and beyond the eventual abdication of the\nlast pretenders to the Roman imperial throne in the Western part of\nthe empire in 476 CE, and further still among medieval scholars and\ntheir successors writing in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and (later on)\nArabic.\n",
