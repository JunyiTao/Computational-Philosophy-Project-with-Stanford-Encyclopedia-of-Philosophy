    "main_text": "The Justification of Revelatory Claims || Traditional Views\n2.1 Traditional Views\n\nIn historical Christian thought, the concepts of (special) revelation\nand faith go together. Faith is the believing response to the\ndivine revelation (Dulles 1992: 4). There has been a broad consensus\nthat the act of faith requires grace in the sense of an internal,\ndivine influence or assistance. However, classical Christian thinkers\nalso agree that the act of faith is reasonable, and that Christian\nbelief is epistemically justified to an eminent degree (Lamont 2004:\n46). In modern parlance, \u201cfaith\u201d is often understood as\nsynonymous with \u201cunsupported belief\u201d, but this\nunderstanding is alien to the historical tradition, for which faith\nconstitutes a form of knowledge. It is traditionally agreed, moreover,\nthat faith has this rational status because it is based on the\nauthority of God\u2019s own testimony. In much pre-modern theology it\nis unclear, however, exactly how God\u2019s testimony or speech is\nidentified as such, and what warrants this identification. \n\nImportant church fathers such as Clement of Alexandria, Origen,\nChrysostom and Augustine all held that there are good arguments from\npublicly accessible evidence for the veridicality of the Christian\nrevelation\u2014arguments that establish the claim that God has\nspoken beyond reasonable doubt. Patristic arguments typically appeal\nto fulfilled prophecies, miracles, \n\n\nthe extension and holiness of the Church, the transformative power of\nthe Christian message and the independently establishable goodness and\ntruth of Christian teaching. (Lamont 2004: 46, 38) \n\n\nHowever, the major church fathers did not seem to view these\napologetic arguments as necessary for proper faith, or as the\nepistemic basis for faith. Instead, the divine revelation\nitself\u2014the word of God\u2014is often portrayed as having the\npower to non-inferentially justify Christian beliefs. As Clement of\nAlexandria writes, \n\n\nHe who has believed in the divine Scriptures, with a firm judgement,\nreceives as an irrefutable demonstration the voice of God who gave us\nthose Scriptures. So faith is no longer something that is confirmed by\ndemonstration. (Stromate II, 2, 9, quoted in Lamont 2004: 32)\n\n\n\nAugustine, likewise, emphasized that Christian belief is produced by\nGod working internally in the believer through grace.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Thomas Aquinas affirms both the supernatural,\ngrace-induced character of Christian belief and its rational warrant.\nSince Aquinas is a common reference point in contemporary discussions\nabout faith and revelation, it will be helpful to consider his thought\nin a bit more detail. (For a comparison between Aquinas\u2019s\nthought on revelation with Jewish and Islamic medieval perspectives,\nsee Dobie 2019.) Aquinas believes that the Christian revelatory claim\ncan be justified, at least to a significant degree, by inferential\narguments (see, e.g., Summa Contra Gentiles I, Ch. 6).\nSometimes he seems to suggest that arguments are necessary for\nrational assent to revelation (Summa Theologiae II-II, q. 2,\na. 9, ad. 3). At other times, however, it appears that faith is\njustified without arguments (ST II-II, q. 27, a. 3, ad. 2.\nSee also Niederbacher 2012: 342\u2013343). Due to this tension, there\nare different interpretations of Aquinas. John Jenkins has helpfully\ndistinguished between the Naturalist Interpretation, the\nVoluntarist Interpretation, and the Supernatural\nExternalist Interpretation (Jenkins 1997: Ch. 6). These\ninterpretations emphasize different elements of Aquinas\u2019s\nthought that are also found in traditional theology in general. As we\nwill see in the following sections, similar elements recur in\ncontemporary theories. \n\nAccording to the Naturalist Interpretation, at least some\npersons assent to the articles of the Creed because, first, they\naccept a cluster of arguments from natural theology, second, they\nbelieve on the basis of human testimony and other evidence that\nmiracles and other signs have occurred in biblical history and in the\nhistory of the church. From these considerations they conclude that\nGod has made a revelation in history, which is contained, in its\nessence, in the Creed. The Christian revelatory claim is justified on\nthis inferential basis. Grace and God\u2019s supernatural influence\nhas little epistemic significance in this process\u2014grace just\nmakes the believer accept God\u2019s revelation without\nreluctance (Penelhum 1977: 146; see also Hick 1988:\n11\u201331).\n\nThe Voluntarist Interpretation, on the other hand, claims\nthat a consideration of the evidence is insufficient to elicit firm\nassent to revelation. What brings this forth, instead, is something\nlike \u201cwishful thinking\u201d or utilitarian considerations.\nAquinas says: \n\n\nWe are moved to believe the words of God insofar as the reward of\neternal life is promised to us if we have believed; and this moves the\nwill to assent. (De Veritate, q. 14, a. 1, quoted in Jenkins\n1997: 176) \n\n\nAn act of the will compensates for the \u201cgap in the\nevidence\u201d. However, since the activity of the will\u2014when it\ncomes to belief in God\u2014is part of a reliable belief-forming\nprocess put in place by grace, the beliefs that it produces are\nwarranted. Aquinas, hence, was an epistemological reliabilist of\nsorts, according to this view (Ross 1985; Stump 1991).\n\nThe Supernatural Externalist Interpretation gives arguments\nfrom public evidence a role in preparing a person for the assent of\nfaith. However, the actual assent is the product of a supernaturally\ninfused cognitive habit. The supernatural \u201clight of faith\u201d\nmakes it possible for a person immediately and non-inferentially to\ngrasp the articles of the Creed as divinely revealed. Belief\nin the revelatory claim is hence a basic belief, and it is\njustified \n\n\nbecause it was arrived at by the proper operation of a cognitive\nprocess which, though infused and not [natural], was nevertheless\ndesigned to attain the truth in this sphere. (Jenkins 1997:\n190\u2013191)\n\n\nMost contemporary Aquinas scholars now reject the Naturalist\nInterpretation, which cannot do justice to the textual evidence.\nHence, even though Aquinas indeed presents a collection of credibility\narguments, he seems to have held that belief in divine revelation can\nbe\u2014and usually is\u2014justified in some other, non-inferential\nway. It is therefore unfortunate that the view represented by the\nNaturalist Interpretation is sometimes taken to be \u201cthe\ntraditional view\u201d of how revelatory claims are justified\n(Penelhum 1997: 67\u201386). \n\nAlthough Aquinas might not be a good fit for \u201cthe traditional\nview\u201d, some later thinkers are. Starting with Duns Scotus, the\nrole of inferential arguments in the rational acceptance of revelation\nwas gradually expanded and made more precise in mainstream Christian\nthought. From the seventeenth century to the mid-twentieth century,\nmost Catholic theologians saw \u201ccredibility arguments\u201d as\nnecessary for faith and as capable of establishing beyond reasonable\ndoubt that God has revealed the Christian religion (Lamont 2004:\n87\u201388). The act of faith was reduced to the drawing of the\nnecessary inference from this insight to the conclusion that Christian\nbeliefs are true. On the Protestant side, this development continued\nand culminated in thinkers such as William Chillingworth, John\nTillotson and John Locke, whose views\u2014ironically\u2014are the\nclosest matches to what Penelhum describes as the \u201ctraditional\nview\u201d. As we have seen, however, the church fathers and Thomas\nAquinas held more complex views in which elements of both inferential\nand non-inferential justification are found, and where supernatural\ngrace and the will play important epistemic roles. Below we will\nencounter again these elements in the accounts of contemporary\nphilosophers and theologians. \n",
