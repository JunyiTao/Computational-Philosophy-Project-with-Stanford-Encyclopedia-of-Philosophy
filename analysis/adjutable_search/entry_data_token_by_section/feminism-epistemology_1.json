    "main_text": "Feminist Standpoint Theory\n2. Feminist Standpoint Theory\n\nStandpoint Epistemology in General. Standpoint\ntheories claim to represent the world from an epistemically advantaged\nsocially situated perspective. A complete standpoint theory must\nspecify (i) the social location of the advantaged\nperspective, (ii) its scope: the subject matters over which\nit claims advantage, (iii) the aspect of the social location\nthat generates epistemic advantage: for example, social role, or\nsubjective identity; (iv) the ground of its advantage: what\njustifies its claim to superiority; (v) the type of epistemic\nsuperiority it claims: for example, greater accuracy, or greater\nability to represent fundamental truths; (vi) the other\nperspectives relative to which it claims advantage, and (vii)\nmodes of access to that perspective: is occupying the social location\nnecessary or sufficient for getting access to the perspective? Many\nlimited claims to epistemic advantage on behalf of particular\nperspectives are uncontroversial. Auto mechanics are in a better\nposition than auto consumers to know what is wrong with their cars.\nPractical experience in fulfilling the mechanic\u2019s role grounds\nmechanics\u2019 epistemic advantage, which claims superior\nreliability. \n\nStandpoint theories usually claim that the perspectives of\nsubordinated social groups have an epistemic advantage regarding\npolitically contested topics related to their subordination, relative\nto the perspectives of the groups that dominate them.\nClassically, standpoint theory claims that the standpoint of\nthe subordinated is advantaged (1) in revealing fundamental\nsocial regularities; (2) in exposing social arrangements as\ncontingent and susceptible to change through concerted\naction; and (3) in representing the social world in relation to\nuniversal human interests. By contrast, dominant group standpoints\nrepresent only surface social regularities in relation to dominant\ngroup interests, and misrepresent them as necessary, natural,\nor universally advantageous. \n\nMarxist Standpoint Theory. Marxism offers the classic\nmodel of standpoint theory, claiming an epistemic advantage over\nfundamental questions of social science and history, on behalf of the\nstandpoint of the proletariat (Marx 1964, Luk\u00e1cs 1971). Workers\nattain this standpoint by gaining collective consciousness of their\nrole in the capitalist system. In virtue of their oppression, they\nhave an interest in the truth about whose interests capitalism serves.\nIn virtue of their centrality, they have experiential access to the\nfundamental relations of capitalist production. In virtue of their\npractical productive activity, they represent it in terms of use\nvalues (labor values), which are the terms in which the fundamental\nlaws of economics and history are expressed. In virtue of their\nstanding as the agents for the universal class they will become under\ncommunism, they represent the social world in relation to universal\nhuman interests. (Capitalists, by contrast, represent the world\nideologically in superficial (exchange value) and parochial (class\ninterested) terms.) Finally, the collective self-consciousness of the\nworkers involves, like all successful intentional action, a\nself-fulfilling prophecy. Workers\u2019 collective insight into their\ncommon predicament and the need to overcome it through revolutionary\naction generates a self-understanding which, when acted upon, gets\nrealized. The epistemic advantage of the standpoint of the proletariat\nis thus also grounded in the epistemic privilege that autonomous\nagents have over what they are consciously doing.\n\nGrounds of Feminist Standpoint Theory. Feminist\nstandpoint theory claims that the standpoint of women has an epistemic\nadvantage over phenomena in which gender is implicated, relative to\ntheories that make sexist or androcentric assumptions. Variants of\nfeminist standpoint theory ground this epistemic advantage in\ndifferent features of women\u2019s social situation, by analogy with\ndifferent strands of Marxist epistemology.\n\nCentrality. Marxist feminists, such as Hartsock (1987) and\nRose (1987) focus on women\u2019s centrality to the system of\nreproduction\u2014of childrearing and caring for bodies. Because\nwomen tend to the needs of everyone in the household, they are in a\nbetter position than men to see how patriarchy fails to meet\npeople\u2019s needs. Men, in virtue of their dominant position, can\nignore how patriarchy undermines subordinates\u2019 interests.\n\nCollective self-consciousness. MacKinnon (1989) argues that\nmen constitute women as women by sexually objectifying them, i.e., by\nrepresenting their natures as essentially sexually subordinate to men\nand treating them accordingly. Women unmask these ideological\nmisrepresentations by achieving and acting on a shared understanding\nof themselves as women\u2014as a group unjustly constituted by sexual\nobjectification. Through collective feminist actions in which women\nrefuse to act as sexual objects\u2014as in campaigns against sexual\nharassment and rape\u2014 women show that representations of women as\nsexual objects are not natural or necessary. Their privileged\nknowledge is collective agent self-knowledge, made true by being put\ninto action in feminist campaigns.\n\nCognitive style. Some early versions of standpoint theory\n(Flax 1983, Hartsock 1987, Rose 1987) accept feminist object relations\ntheory, which explains the development of gender identity in male and\nfemale children raised by female caregivers. Males acquire a masculine\nidentity by distinguishing themselves from their mothers, through\ncontrolling and denigrating the feminine. Females acquire their gender\nidentity through identification with their mothers, blurring\nboundaries between self and other. Males and females thereby acquire\ndistinct cognitive styles. The masculine cognitive style is abstract,\ntheoretical, emotionally detached, atomistic, and oriented toward\ncontrol or domination. The feminine cognitive style is concrete,\npractical, emotionally engaged, relational, and oriented toward care.\nThese cognitive styles are reinforced by the gendered division of\nlabor\u2014men having a near monopoly on positions of political,\neconomic, and military power calling for detachment and control; and\nwomen being assigned to emotional care for others. The feminine\ncognitive style claims epistemic advantage because ways of knowing\nbased on caring for everyone\u2019s needs produce more valuable\nrepresentations than ways of knowing based on domination (Hartsock\n1987). Institutionalizing feminine ways of knowing requires overcoming\nthe division of mental, manual, and caring labor that characterizes\ncapitalist patriarchy (Rose 1987).\n\nOppression. Women have an interest in representing social\nphenomena in ways that reveal their oppression. They also have\npersonal experience of sexist oppression, unlike men, whose power\nenables them to ignore how their actions affect women. If epistemic\nadvantage is grounded in oppression, the multiply oppressed have\nadditional epistemic authority. Thus, Collins (1990) grounds black\nfeminist epistemology in black women\u2019s personal experiences of\nracism and sexism. She uses this epistemology to supply black women\nwith self-representations that enable them to resist demeaning racist\nand sexist images of black women, and to take pride in their\nidentities. The epistemic advantage of the oppressed is sometimes\nfounded on\u201cbifurcated consciousness\u201d: the ability to see\nboth from the perspective of the dominant and from the perspective of\nthe oppressed (Harding 1991, Collins 1990).\n\nAccess to the Feminist Standpoint. Every standpoint\ntheory must explain how one gains access to it. Most standpoint\ntheories represent the epistemically advantaged standpoint not as\ngiven, but as achieved through critical reflection on the power\nstructures constituting group identities. If the group and its\ninterests are defined objectively, the facts that constitute the group\nand its interests are publicly accessible. So anyone can theorize\nphenomena in relation to the interests of that group. However, if\nepistemic advantage lies in collective agent-knowledge, its site lies\nin the group defining itself as a collective agent. The privileged\nstandpoint is not that of women, but of feminists (MacKinnon 1989).\nMen can participate in the feminist movement. But they cannot assume a\ndominant role in defining (hence knowing) its aims, given the feminist\ninterest in overcoming male dominance.\n\nGoals of Feminist Standpoint Theory. Feminist\nstandpoint theory is a type of\n critical theory.\n Critical theories aim to empower the oppressed. To serve this aim,\nsocial theories must (a) represent the world in relation to the\ninterests of the oppressed; (b) enable the oppressed to understand\ntheir problems; and (c) be usable by the oppressed to improve their\ncondition. Claims of superiority for critical theories are thus\nfundamentally based on pragmatic virtues (Harding 1991, Hartsock\n1996).\n\nCriticisms of Feminist Standpoint Theory. Longino\n(1993b) argues that standpoint theory cannot provide a noncircular\nbasis for deciding which standpoints have epistemic privilege. Crenshaw (1999) argues\nthat it is implausible to hold that any group inequality is\ncentral to all the others; they intersect in complex ways. Hence,\nwomen cannot have privileged access to understanding their oppression,\nsince this takes different forms for different women, depending on\ntheir race, sexual orientation, and other identities. This critique\nhas been developed by feminist postmodernists, who question the\npossibility of a unified standpoint of women, and see, behind the\nassertion of a universal woman\u2019s viewpoint, the perspective of\nrelatively privileged white women (Lugones & Spelman 1983).\n",
