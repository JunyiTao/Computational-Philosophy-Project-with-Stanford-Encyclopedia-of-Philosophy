Dingle, his stew having finally boiled over, wrote privately\nto the editor of Nature, first castigating the rampant\ncosmological \u2018mysticism\u2019 passing itself off for science,\nand then offering to produce an article taking the sword to the\nmystics themselves. His offer was immediately accepted. The result was\nDingle\u2019s notorious \u201cModern Aristotelianism\u201d, a\npolemical diatribe chiefly against Milne, but aimed as well at\nEddington and Dirac on account of their \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the\nscientific method of Newton and his fellow members of the Royal\nSociety (Dingle 1937).\n",
