    "main_text": "Normative Issues || Sex and Technology\n3. The Value of Sex\n\nWhat is the value of sex? How important (or valuable!) is this value?\nProcreation, love, and pleasure are obvious answers to the first\nquestion. Sex is usually the way to procreate, so sex is valuable\ninsofar as procreation is valuable. But this value is instrumental,\nand it is contingent given technology\u2019s ability to separate\nprocreation from sex. There is also anti-natalism (Schopenhauer 1851,\n1859, ch. 46; Benatar 2006, 2015), which implies that sex has negative\nvalue in its procreative aspect. The value of sex in regard to\nprocreation is thus precarious.\n\nAnother instrumental value of sex is that X\u2019s sexual\ndesire for Y can (help) cause X to love Y\n(Bertocci 1949, ch. 2). Here, sex\u2019s value is contingent on\nlove\u2019s, and, despite sounding strange, the value of romantic\nlove, especially in its early, passionate stages, is not obvious given\nits negative effects on the lover and others. Still, if sex leads to\nthe settled stage of love (via the passionate one), it is valuable for\nthat. Sex can also express love and affection for one\u2019s partner\nand cement their relationship. Natasha McKeever argues that many goods\nof sex\u2014pleasure, union, intimacy, and care\u2014are shared with\nthose of love, so sexual interaction enhances and strengthens the love\n(McKeever 2016; see also McKeever 2017, but see Vannoy 1980: ch. 1).\nEven if true, all this still makes sex\u2019s value dependent on and\ninstrumental to love\u2019s, especially since the two are very\ndifferent (Goldman 1977, 272\u2013275; Soble 2008, ch. 9 [which adds\nmarriage to the mix]; Vannoy 1980, 7\u201312).\n\nDoes sex have intrinsic value? If it does, it is probably sexual\npleasure, as-sensation or as-enjoyment, a pleasure that provides\npeople with a crucial motive for having sex, often with drastic\nconsequences. So then how valuable is the pleasure of sex? Perhaps we\nshould regard our appetite for sex like we do that for food to avoid\nobsessing about it (Russell 1929 [1970, 289]). But can we go\nfurther?\n\nPeople spend much time pursuing projects and activities they enjoy or\nconsider worthwhile. Some do so only when time, work, or family time\npermit, and some do so much of the time (they are, say, independently\nwealthy). Writing, pursuing Hollywood or Bollywood stardom, playing\nchess, swimming, traveling, and, of course, building a family are\nexamples. Other than philosophical far-fetched examples of worthless\npursuits (counting blades of grass, collecting bottle caps), most\nprojects and activities have some worth, unless we are\nwilling to condemn most human beings of having worthless lives.\nPerhaps some projects are more worthwhile than others (though how to\nargue for this is difficult), but almost all have some worth, and an\nintellectual one at that, including what many might consider to be\nmentally passive, such as watching reality television or reading junk\nfiction (Carroll 1998, esp. ch. 1 and 2).\n\nNow consider X, whose life project is the pursuit of sexual\npleasures. X says,\n\n\nI am young, moderately good-looking, and, with current technology, I\ncan easily sexually hook up with others. I enjoy sex, and it makes me\nfeel good. In between bouts of sex, I can see friends, go to the gym,\nmovies, whatever. But my deepest enjoyment\u2014my life-plan, to use\nphilosophical jargon\u2014is to pursue the pleasures of sex.\n\n\nIs there something we can say to prove X wrong, especially if\nX has the talent for something considered more important?\nPerhaps we can claim that pursuing sex is not as worthy as reading\nRussian literature, but even here we are on insecure ground.\n\nOne can argue that X is not using X\u2019s\nintellectual powers. But this underestimates the reliance on intellect\nin sexual pursuits or presumes that such use is unimportant.\nAlternatively, one can argue that X is not using\nX\u2019s intellectual powers deeply or in a theoretical way.\nBut this would rule out many a life as good. One can argue that there\nare more important things in life than pursuing sexual pleasure. But\nX need not live without friends, family, and other important\nthings present in normal lives. One can argue that sex objectifies, so\nit is wrong to make it central to one\u2019s life. But unless one\nwere a die-hard Kantian, the objectification involved in sex can be\nredeemed by other factors.\n\nOne can argue that sexual sensory pleasure \u201cwill not be at the\ncenter of a rational life plan,\u201d and that these pleasures are\n\u201cintermittent and short-lived,\u201d their value ultimately\ndepending \u201centirely on the interpersonal relationships into\nwhich they fit and which constitute their context\u201d (Goldman\n2016: 98). But it is unclear why the pleasures\u2019 brevity and\nintermittency are problems. One can argue that someone who prefers\nmasturbation to sex with others \u201ccould reflect a failure to\nunderstand the importance and value of sex and sexual pleasure\u201d\n(Scanlon 1998, 175) because the importance of sex is its expression in\nrelations with other people (Scanlon seems not to have in mind casual\nor promiscuous sex). But X can have affectionate sexual\nrelationships with others, and friendships, etc., with different\nothers. Even casual hookups have their bonding aspects. Finally, one\ncan argue that sex \u201cachieves a level of passion\u201d with\n\u201cno equal in other forms of interaction,\u201d especially when\nit occurs between lovers\n\n\nit defines a most significant moment of goodness between two people,\nwhere each achieves a most profound moment of affirmation and\nsatisfaction that is inextricably tied to the endeavor to please the\nother (Thomas 1999, 59).\n\n\nBut note how the affirmation and satisfaction here can as easily apply\nto passionate yet love-less sex.\n\nThus, even if pursuing sexual pleasure is not as intellectually\nstimulating as reading classical Arabic poetry, it is not worthless,\nwhether intellectually or non-intellectually, and it is on a par with\nmany other pursuits that people undertake that are far from having\nintellectual depth. Moreover,\n\n\n[I]sn\u2019t being a provider of sexual pleasure an important and\nvaluable attribute, one to be cherished? Maybe we should construct a\ntheory of human dignity based on our sexual capacities \u2026\ninstead of looking for something \u201cfiner\u201d beyond or above\nthe sexual (Soble 2002, 58\u201359).\n\n\nIf X conducts X\u2019s life morally, and if\nX develops some talents or hobbies for those rainy\ndays (sure to come) when X is no longer sexually desirable\nand X\u2019s friends are busy with other things, then\nX\u2019s life is not less worthwhile than most human lives.\nClaiming otherwise is philosophically haughty and pretentious.\n",
