Beyond Coherence\n\nAnalytic literature on the Trinity has been laser-focused on the\nlogical coherence of \u201cthe\u201d doctrine, addressing an\nimagined critic arguing that the doctrine is clearly incoherent. They\ndo this by suggesting models of the Trinity, intelligible and arguably\ncoherent interpretations of most or all of the traditional language.\nBut in recent work the tools of analytic philosophy have been applied\nto several closely related issues.\n",
