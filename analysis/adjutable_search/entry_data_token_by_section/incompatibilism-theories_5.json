    "main_text": "Event-Causal Theories || Deliberative Indeterminism\n2.1 Deliberative Indeterminism\n\nSome writers accept that indeterminism located in the immediate\ncausation of a decision or other action would diminish the\nagent\u2019s control but hold that indeterminism confined to earlier\nstages in the process leading to a decision need not do so. Laura\nEkstrom (2000: ch. 4 and 2003) and Alfred Mele (1995: ch. 12, 1996,\n1999b, and 2006: 9\u201314) have advanced the most fully developed\naccounts of this sort. Such views have also been sketched by Daniel\nDennett (1978) and John Martin Fischer (1995).\n\nOvert action is sometimes preceded by a decision, and decision is\nsometimes preceded by a deliberative process in which the agent\nconsiders reasons for and against alternatives and makes an evaluative\njudgment concerning which alternative is best (or better or good\nenough). Focusing on decisions that follow such deliberation, Mele\nadvances a view that allows (but does not require) the deterministic\ncausation of the decision by the making of the judgment, and of the\novert action by the decision. Indeterminism is required only at an\nearlier stage of the deliberative process. For example, the account is\nsatisfied when it is undetermined which of a certain subset of the\nagent\u2019s nonoccurrent beliefs come to mind in the process of\ndeliberation, where their coming to mind combines with other events to\nbring about the agent\u2019s evaluative judgment. (The subset in\nquestion consists of \u201cbeliefs whose coming or not coming to mind\nis not something that one would control even if determinism were\ntrue\u201d [1995: 216].)\n\nMele argues that indeterminism of the sort required here does not\ndiminish (at least not to any significant extent) what he calls\n\u201cproximal control,\u201d a variety of control constituted by\nthe relatively direct causation of behavior, and one that is\ncompatible with determinism. The required indeterminism nevertheless\nsuffices, he holds, to provide the agent with \u201cultimate\ncontrol\u201d over her decision, which an agent has only if at no\ntime prior to the decision is there any causally sufficient condition\nfor the agent\u2019s making that decision that consists entirely of\nevents or states external to the agent.\n\nEkstrom (2019) has recently criticized her older account and defended\na centered view of the sort discussed in the next section. But her\nprevious account is worthy of consideration. Ekstrom\u2019s account\nemphasized preference rather than evaluative judgment. A preference,\nas she understands it, is a desire \u201cformed by a process of\ncritical evaluation with respect to one\u2019s conception of the\ngood\u201d (2000: 106). The formation of a preference, she\nmaintained, is an action. She required indeterminism only in the\nproduction of these preferences. A decision or other action is free,\non her view, just in case it is brought about, in an appropriate way,\nby an active formation of a preference (favoring that decision or\naction), which preference-formation is in turn the result of an\nuncoerced exercise of the agent\u2019s evaluative faculty, the inputs\nto which nondeterministically cause that preference-formation.\n\nEkstrom held that an agent is her preferences and acceptances\n(reflectively held beliefs), together with her faculty of forming\nthese by reflective evaluation. When the formation of a preference is\nnondeterministically caused and it deterministically causes a decision\nand subsequent action, then a preference that partly constitutes the\nagent, one that is generated by an evaluative faculty that partly\nconstitutes the agent, and one that the agent could have prevented (by\nnot forming that preference) causally determines the decision and\nsubsequent action. What the agent does is then, Ekstrom claimed, up to\nher.\n\nBoth Mele\u2019s and Ekstrom\u2019s deliberative theories allow that\na decision or other action can be free even if it is causally\ndetermined by events none of which is a free action, and to none of\nwhich has the agent contributed by performing any prior free action.\nIndeed, given the basic features of these accounts, both of them must\n(on pain of regress) allow this. Incompatibilists do not typically\nallow for such a thing.\n\nIf an event is not itself a free action, and if no free action by the\nagent in question contributed to that event, then, we may say, it is\nnot up to the agent whether that event occurs. Incompatibilists\ngenerally hold that if one event determines another, then it is not up\nto anybody whether if the first event occurs then the second event\noccurs. And arguments for incompatibilism often employ a principle\nlike the following: if it is not up to a given agent whether a certain\nevent occurs, and it is not up to that agent whether if that event\noccurs then the agent performs a certain action, then it is not up to\nthe agent whether she performs that action. Given this principle, it\nwill have to be said of certain decisions that deliberative theorists\ncount as free that it is not up to us whether we make those decisions.\nDeliberative theorists, then, apparently reject this principle; but\nthe rejection raises the question whether their incompatibilism is\nwell motivated.\n",
