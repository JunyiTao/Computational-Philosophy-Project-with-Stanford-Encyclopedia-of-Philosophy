    "main_text": "The importance of happiness || Is happiness overrated?\n4.3 Is happiness overrated?\n\nThe preceding section discussed ways that happiness might figure\nprominently even in non-mental state theories of well-being. The\nquestion there concerned the role of happiness in theories of\nwell-being. This is a different question from how important happiness\nis for well-being itself. Even a theory of well-being that includes no\nmention at all of happiness can allow that happiness is nonetheless a\nmajor component or contributor to well-being, because of its relation\nto the things that ultimately constitute well-being. If you hold a\ndesire theory of well-being, for instance, you will very likely allow\nthat, for most people, happiness is a central aspect of well-being,\nsince most people very much desire to be happy. Indeed, some desire\ntheorists have argued that the account actually yields a form of\nhedonism, on the grounds that people ultimately desire nothing else\nbut happiness or pleasure (Sidgwick 1907 [1966], Brandt 1979,\n1989).\n\nHappiness may be thought important even on theories normally believed\nto take a dismissive view of it. Aristotelians identify well-being\nwith virtuous activity, yet Aristotle plainly takes this to be a\nhighly pleasant condition, indeed the most pleasant kind of life there\nis (see, e.g., NE, Bk. I 8; Bk. VII 13). You cannot flourish,\non Aristotelian terms, without being happy, and unhappiness is clearly\nincompatible with well-being. Even the Stoics, who notoriously regard\nall but a virtuous inner state as at best indifferent, would still\nassign happiness a kind of importance: at the very least, to be\nunhappy would be unvirtuous; and virtue itself arguably entails a kind\nof happiness, namely a pleasant state of tranquility. As well,\nhappiness would likely be a preferred indifferent in most cases, to be\nchosen over unhappiness. To be sure, both Aristotelian and Stoic\naccounts are clear that happiness alone does not suffice for\nwell-being, that its significance is not what common opinion takes it\nto be, and that some kinds of happiness can be worthless or even bad.\nBut neither denies that happiness is somehow quite important for human\nwell-being.\n\nIn fact it is questionable whether any major school of philosophical\nthought denies outright the importance of happiness, at least on one\nof the plausible accounts of the matter. Doubts about its significance\nprobably owe to several factors. Some skeptics, for example, focus on\nrelatively weak conceptions of happiness, such as the idea that it is\nlittle more than the simple emotion of feeling happy\u2014an\nidea that few hedonists or emotional state theorists would accept. Or,\nalternatively, assuming that a concern for happiness has only to do\nwith positive states. Yet \u2018happiness\u2019 also serves as a\nblanket term for a domain of concern that involves both positive\nand negative states, namely the kinds of mental states\ninvolved in being happy or unhappy. Just as \u201chealth\u201d care\ntends to focus mainly on ill health, so might happiness researchers\nchoose to focus much of their effort on the study and alleviation of\nunhappiness\u2014depression, suffering, anxiety, and other conditions\nwhose importance is uncontroversial. The study of happiness need be no\nmore concerned with smiles than with frowns.\n",
