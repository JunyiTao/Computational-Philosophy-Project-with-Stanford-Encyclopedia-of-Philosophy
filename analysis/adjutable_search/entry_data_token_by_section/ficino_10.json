    "main_text": "Philosophical themes || Ethics, Love\n4. Legacy\n\n\nFicino died in 1499, leaving a significant cultural legacy.\nTextually, he provided western European thinkers with authoritative\nversions of Plato, Plotinus, and other Platonizing thinkers.  Ficino\u2019s\nLatin translations of those texts became standard ones for over three\ncenturies after his death. Ficino\u2019s theories on love permeated\nsixteenth-century literature, as writers from Baldassare Castiglione\nand Pietro Bembo in Italy to Joachim du Bellay and Pierre de Ronsard\nin France took up \u201cPlatonic\u201d love in their literary\nworks.\n\n\nFicino also helped legitimize, for a time, a style of thinking that\none sixteenth-century thinker, Agostino Steuco, termed\n\u201cperennial philosophy\u201d (philosophia perennis), a\ndesignation that became more famous when Gottfried Leibniz took it up\nin a 1714 letter (Leibniz, DPS, 3: 624\u201325; Schmitt\n1966, 506, n.11).  Adherents believed that there was a discernible\ncore of truth in many philosophies seen as different on the\nsurface. The late sixteenth century saw the teaching of Platonism at\nthe University of Ferrara, with the Croatian-born Francesco Patrizi\n(1529\u20131597) holding the chair from 1578\u201392, moving thence\nto teach Platonic thought at the University of Rome from 1592 until\nhis death.\n\n\nAs the new science took hold in the seventeenth century and as, in the\neighteenth century, new styles of thinking about the history of\nphilosophy grew, Ficino\u2019s reputation declined. The canon-making\nhistorian of philosophy Johann Jakob Brucker wrote in the 1740s that\nFicino \u201cobtained a humble rank\u201d because, \u201ccaptivated\nby the trifles of later Platonists, he feigns, re-feigns, and changes\nPlato\u201d (Brucker, 4.1: 55). For Brucker, as for many who followed\nhim, the enterprise of philosophy needed to become a\n\u201ccritical,\u201d rationalistic enterprise; and philosophy\nitself, separating itself from natural philosophy, grew ever more\nconcerned with questions of epistemology. This is to say that\nphilosophers\u2019 concerns began to revolve, if sometimes only obliquely\nand unconsciously, around the question of how a formally distinct,\n\u201cextension-less\u201d mind could know things about and within\nan exterior world to which it was fundamentally unconnected. Citizens\nof this new philosophical republic had little time for semi-mythical\nancient sages, hidden natural sympathies, and the interpretive style\nof philosophizing (concerned more with styles of life and less with\nsystematic theories) at which Ficino so excelled. Yet his thought\npermeated many aspects of western intellectual life. Making Plato and\nPlatonism respectable subjects of research and philosophical\nreflection; embracing a broad view of human religious history; and\nfocusing overtly, through practice as well as theory, on the\nimportance of teaching the young: these aspects of his achievements\nand more make Ficino a Renaissance philosopher worth remembering\ntoday.\n",
