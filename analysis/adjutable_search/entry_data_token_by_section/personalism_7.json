    "main_text": "Characteristics of personalist thought || The dignity of the person\n6.2 The dignity of the person\n\n\nIn stressing the uniqueness of persons vis-\u00e0-vis all other\nentities, personalists influenced by Thomism designate the essential\ndividing line of reality as that which separates personal and\nnon-personal being. Dealings with persons, therefore, require a\ndifferent ethical paradigm from that used to describe dealings with\nnon-personal realities. The \u201crules\u201d of dealing with\nnon-personal reality do not hold when dealing with persons, and\nvice-versa. This radical dichotomy between persons and non-persons is\nessentially ontological, or transcendental-constitutive, but produces immediate consequences on the\nethical level.\n\n\nAt the center of this personalism stands an affirmation of the dignity\nof the person, the quality, insisted on already by medieval thinkers,\nwhich constitutes the unique excellence of personhood and which gives\nrise to specific moral requirements. Dignity refers to the inherent\nvalue of the person, as a \u201csomeone\u201d and not merely\n\u201csomething,\u201d and this confers an absoluteness not found in\nother beings. Here classical-realist personalists reject the Hobbesian\nnotion of dignity as the price set on an individual by the\ncommonwealth, and ally themselves rather with Kant in his assertion\nthat dignity is inherent and sets itself beyond all price. The\nlanguage of dignity rules out the possibility of involving persons in\na trade-off, as if their worth were a function of their utility. Every\nperson without exception is of inestimable worth, and no one is\ndispensable or interchangeable. The person can never be lost or\nassimilated fully into the collectivity, because his interrelatedness\nwith other persons is defined by his possession of a unique,\nirreplaceable value. The agreement with Kant in this regard can be\nsaid to constitute a bridge between personalism in the broader sense\nand personalism in the narrow sense.\n\n\nAttributing a unique dignity or worth to the human person also throws\nlight on the cardinal virtue of justice. Rendering \u201cto each his\ndue\u201d hinges on one\u2019s understanding of what each deserves, and\nthis cannot be correctly ascertained without taking into account the\ndignity and worth that are at the same time general qualities of all\npersons, and inseparable from the singularity of each of\nthem. Personalists in the broader sense therefore lay special stress\non what persons deserve by the very fact of their personhood, and on\nthe difference between acting toward a person and acting toward any\nother reality. When the person is the object of one\u2019s action, a whole\nethical structure enters into play that is absent when the object of\none\u2019s action is a thing.  How persons should be treated forms an\nindependent ethical category, separate in essence and not only in\ndegree from how non-persons (things) are to be treated. Whereas\ntraditional ethical systems stress the internal mechanisms of the\nmoral agent (conscience, obligation, sin, virtue, etc.) and the effect\nthat free actions have on moral character, personalists add to this a\nparticular concern for the transcendent character of human action and\nthe dignity of the one being acted upon. The person\u2019s absolute\ncharacter provides for the possibility of absolute moral norms when\ndealing with persons.\n\n\nFor personalists, human dignity as such does not depend on variables\nsuch as native intelligence, athletic ability or social prowess. Nor\ncan it result merely from good conduct or moral merit. It must rather\nbe rooted in human nature itself, so that on the deepest level,\ndespite the variations of moral conduct and the resultant differences\nin moral character, all members of the species share this dignity. The\ndifference between being something and someone has been seen as so\nradical that it does not admit of degrees. Most personalists have\ndenied that personhood is something that can be gradually attained. It\nis like a binary function (1 or 0) or a toggle switch (on or off),\nthat admits no middle ground.\n\n\nBut as we have seen, these positions can be related to a not wholly\nunproblematic view of non-human nature. Personalists in the narrow\nsense accept, as far as it goes, the view of the dignity of man as\nfound in Kant\u2019s ethics or practical philosophy, but modify and add to\nit not least from the perspective of a more thoroughgoingly\npersonalist understanding of the importance of individual\nuniqueness. And since they do not merely emphasize the importance of\nthe person within the framework of a pre-existing metaphysics and a\nphilosophical and theological anthropology, there is available to them\na theoretical space for conceiving of the non-human world of\n\u201csomethings\u201d in a less objectifying and exploitative\nmanner. The early, idealistic personalists were much more inclined to\nsee external nature too as ultimately expressive of personal reality,\nand to account for its impersonal appearance in terms of the\nlimitations of finite perception.\n",
