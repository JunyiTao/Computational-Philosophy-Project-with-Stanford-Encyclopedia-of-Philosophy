    "main_text": "\n\nConsider this case: Tonya plans to do Y, but Irving wants her\nto do X instead. Irving has tried unsuccessfully to provide\nTonya with reasons for doing X rather than Y. If\nIrving is unwilling to resort to coercion or force, he might deploy\nany of the following tactics to try to influence Tonya\u2019s choice.\nFor example, Irving might \u2026\n\nCharm Tonya into wanting to please Irving by doing\nX.\nExaggerate the advantages of doing X and the\ndisadvantages of doing Y, and/or understate the disadvantages\nof doing X and the advantages of doing Y.\nMake Tonya feel guilty for preferring to do Y.\nInduce Tonya into an emotional state that makes doing X\nseem more appropriate than it really is.\nPoint out that doing Y will make Tonya seem less worthy\nand appealing to her friends.\nMake Tonya feel badly about herself and portray Y as a\nchoice that will confirm or exacerbate this feeling, and/or portray\nX as a choice that will disconfirm or combat it.\nDo a small favor for Tonya before asking her to do X, so\nthat she feels obligated to comply.\nMake Tonya doubt her own judgment so that she will\nrely on Irving\u2019s advice to do X.\nMake it clear to Tonya that if she does Y\nrather than X, Irving will withdraw his friendship, sulk, or\nbecome irritable and generally unpleasant.\nFocus Tonya\u2019s attention on some aspect of doing Y\nthat Tonya fears and ramp up that fear to get her to change her mind\nabout doing Y.\n\n\nEach of these tactics could reasonably be called manipulation. Many\nalso have more specific, commonplace names, such as \u201cguilt\ntrip\u201d (tactic 3), \u201cgaslighting\u201d (tactic 8),\n\u201cpeer pressure\u201d (tactic 5), \u201cnegging\u201d (tactic\n6), and \u201cemotional blackmail\u201d (tactic 9). Perhaps not\neveryone will agree that every tactic on this list is\nproperly described as manipulation. And in some cases, whether the\ntactic seems manipulative may depend on various details not specified\nin the case as described. For example, if Y is seriously\nimmoral, then perhaps it is not manipulative for Irving to induce\nTonya to feel guilty about planning to do Y. It is also\npossible that we might revise our judgments about some of these\ntactics in light of a fully worked out and well supported theory of\nmanipulation\u2014if we had one. Nevertheless, this list should\nprovide a reasonably good sense of what we mean by\n\u201cmanipulation\u201d in ordinary discourse. It should also serve\nto illustrate the wide variety of tactics commonly described as\nmanipulation.\n\nManipulation is often characterized as a form of influence that is\nneither coercion nor rational persuasion. But this characterization\nimmediately raises the question: Is every form of influence\nthat is neither coercion nor rational persuasion a form of\nmanipulation? If manipulation does not occupy the entire logical space\nof influences that are neither rational persuasion nor coercion, then\nwhat distinguishes it from other forms of influence that are neither\ncoercion nor rational persuasion?\n\nThe term \u201cmanipulation\u201d is commonly thought to include an\nelement of moral disapprobation: To say that Irving manipulated Tonya\nis commonly taken to be a moral criticism of Irving\u2019s behavior.\nIs manipulation always immoral? Why is manipulation immoral\n(when it is immoral)? If manipulation is not always immoral, then what\ndetermines when it is immoral?\n",
