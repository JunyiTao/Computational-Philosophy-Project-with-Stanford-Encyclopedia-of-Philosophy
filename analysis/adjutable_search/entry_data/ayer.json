    "preamble": "\n\n\nA.J. Ayer (1910\u20131989) was only 24 when he wrote the book that made his\nphilosophical name, Language, Truth, and Logic (hereafter\nLTL), published in 1936. In it he put forward what were\nunderstood to be the major theses of logical positivism, and so\nestablished himself as the leading English representative of the\nmovement, Viennese in origin. In endorsing these views Ayer saw\nhimself as continuing in the line of British empiricism established by\nJohn Locke and David Hume, an empiricism whose most recent\nrepresentative was Bertrand Russell. Throughout his subsequent career\nhe remained true to this tradition\u2019s rejection of the\npossibility of synthetic a priori knowledge, and so he saw\nthe method of philosophy to be the analysis of the meaning of key\nterms, such as \u2018causality\u2019, \u2018truth\u2019,\n\u2018knowledge\u2019, \u2018freedom\u2019, and so on. The major\nportion of his work was devoted to exploring different facets of our\nclaims to knowledge, particularly perceptual knowledge and knowledge\nthat depended on inductive inference for its credence. Along the way\nhe defended a \u2018justified true belief\u2019 account of\nknowledge, a Humean account of causation, and compatibilism with\nrespect to freedom.  In\nLTL he put forward an emotivist theory of ethics, one that he\nnever abandoned.\n\nAyer always wrote with stylish crispness and clarity; he could lay\nbare the bones of a philosophical difficulty in a few paragraphs of\nstrikingly simple prose. On many a philosophical problem Ayer cannot\nbe bettered for providing a lucid, informative, and revealing\ndescription of its contours. Above all, on reading an essay of his,\nwhether it be on basic propositions, sense data, induction, or\nfreedom, one comes away recognizing that the aim of the author has\nbeen to reach the truth, no matter what that turned out to be.\nUnfortunately, he sometimes rushed to reach it, which, together with\nthe directness of his style, gave him a reputation for mere cleverness\nthat he never lived down. Nevertheless, amongst British philosophers\nof the 20th Century he has been ranked as second only to\nRussell (Foster 1985); P.F. Strawson, at his memorial service, stated\nthat his contribution to the theory of knowledge and general\nmetaphysics was \u201cin no way inferior to Russell\u2019s\u201d\n(see Rogers 1999, 358).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\n\nAlfred Jules Ayer was born in London on October 29, 1910. His mother,\nReine, was descended from Dutch Jews, whilst his father, Jules Louis\nCypress Ayer, came from a Swiss Calvinist background. As recounted in\nRogers 1999, Ayer was a precocious but mischievous child, and so was\nsent to boarding school (outside Eastbourne) at the age of seven, from\nwhich he won a scholarship to Eton in 1923. There he impressed his\npeers with his intelligence and competitiveness, the latter trait\nmanifesting itself in the way he played games. Ayer nevertheless felt\nan \u2018outsider\u2019, and it is clear that his fellow-students\ndid not warm to him, perhaps due to the excessive zeal with which he\nattempted to convert them to atheism.  Feeling \u2018an\noutsider\u2019 was something that remained with him all his life. At\nthe age of sixteen he specialized in classics and at the same time\nstarted reading some philosophy. Bertrand Russell\u2019s\nSceptical Essays made an impression, particularly Russell\u2019s\nargument for the claim that it is undesirable to believe a proposition\nwhen there is no ground for believing its truth.  Ayer said that this\nremained a motto for him throughout his philosophical career (see\nRogers 1999, 45). At the same time a reading of G.E. Moore\u2019s Principia\nEthica also had a lasting effect, particularly Moore\u2019s\narticulation of the Naturalistic Fallacy.\n\n\nThe Easter before leaving Eton, Ayer spent some time in Paris, where he\nmet Renee Lees, whom he subsequently married (in 1933). The following\nyear (1929) he won a classics scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford,\nwhere he studied both Greek and philosophy, one of his tutors being\nGilbert Ryle. It was Ryle who suggested that Ayer read Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s\nTractatus Logico-Philosophicus, a work that immediately\nimpressed him. Ryle was also instrumental in getting Ayer to go to\nVienna in 1933 to study with Moritz Schlick, then leader of the\ninfluential Vienna Circle of philosophers, scientists and other\nintellectuals, joining W. V. O. Quine in being one of only two\nvisitors to be members of the Vienna Circle. His philosophical\nexperience in Vienna was somewhat limited by his uncertain knowledge\nof German, but he knew enough to pick up the basic tenets of logical\npositivism.\n\n\nAfter leaving Vienna, Ayer lectured for a short time at Christ Church,\nwhere in 1935 he was elected to a five-year research fellowship. In\nthe same year he finished LTL, which caused a great deal of\ncontroversy and debate, partly for its sweeping dismissal of\nmetaphysics, but especially for the metaethical emotivism Ayer\nchampioned in one of its most notorious chapters. During the next few\nyears, Ayer worked at defending and refining some of the positions\nadopted in LTL, not least at meetings in Oxford with Isaiah\nBerlin, Stuart Hampshire, and J.L.  Austin; the confrontations with\nAustin were to prove long-lasting. The product of this refining\nprocess was the book Foundations of Empirical Knowledge.\nDuring this time he also enjoyed life to the full; he was a good\ndancer, once confessing that he would have preferred to be a\ntap-dancer rather than a professional philosopher, but had given up on\nthe idea when he recognized that he would never be as good as Fred\nAstaire. His marriage to Renee started to disintegrate; Ayer had\nnumerous affairs, and Renee formed an enduring relationship with\nStuart Hampshire.\n\n\nIn the immediate pre-war years, Ayer had become passionate about\npolitics. He supported the Republican side in Spain, flirted with\njoining the Communist Party, but instead became an active member of\nthe Labour Party. When war was declared he joined the Welsh Guards\n(and was helped to do so by Gilbert Ryle). He worked for a while in\nCambridge interrogating prisoners, then was sent to America to join a\nsecret service mission, one which seemed to involve gathering\ninformation about Fascist sympathizers in America. Whilst in New York\nhe reviewed films for the Nation, fathered a daughter (Sheila\nGraham was the mother), and made a record with Lauren Bacall. On being\nrepatriated to England, Ayer found himself given the job of helping\nwith the organization of the French resistance movements in\nLondon. Shortly after the war he was posted to Paris, where he took\nthe opportunity to study French existentialism, writing articles on\nSartre and Camus in Horizon.\n\n\nOn his release from Army service Ayer accepted the offer of a tutorial\nfellowship at Wadham College, Oxford, but was there only a short while\nbefore becoming the Grote Professor of Philosophy at University\nCollege, London, at the age of 36. He quickly appointed Hampshire to a\nlectureship (making up for having cited Hampshire as co-respondent in\nhis divorce from Renee), then Richard Wollheim. The department grew\nand became a thriving philosophical center.  Ayer also ventured into\nthe world of radio, being involved in many BBC Third Programme\nbroadcasts, including panel discussions with the scientists Zuckerman,\nHuxley and Medawar, and a famous debate with the Jesuit priest\nFrederick Copleston on the existence of God. Later he became a regular\nperformer on BBC television\u2019s \u201cThe Brains Trust\u201d. In\n1948 he lectured at Bard College in New York, but it proved to be an\nunhappy experience. Back in London C.E.M. Joad had published an\narticle in the\nNew Statesman arguing that LTL was responsible for\ncreating an environment in which Fascism flourished, and Time\nmagazine published an unflattering short article claiming that Ayer\ntaught his students that \u201cThat man is good to support his\nmother\u201d was a meaningless statement (Rogers 1999,\np. 232). On his return to Europe he started a hectic schedule of\nlecture tours, visiting France, Belgium, Italy, Sweden, Denmark, Peru,\nChile, Uruguay, and Brazil, all in the early 1950s.\n\n\nIn 1958 Ayer took the opportunity to return to Oxford as Wykeham\nProfessor of Logic. He later said that this decision was made in order\nto combat the growing influence of Austin, who had made a point of\nattacking Ayer\u2019s views on perception. Austin was, however, soon\nto die, making Ayer\u2019s \u2018sacrifice\u2019 of his life in\nLondon somewhat pointless. Not that it was completely sacrificed; he\nbi-located, spending long weekends in London with his second wife, Dee\nWells, and at most three nights in New College during the week. He\ncontinued to travel widely: China, Russia, India, and Pakistan were\nadded to the itinerary. He also continued his political activity,\ncontinuing to support the Labour Party, campaigning against British\ninvolvement in Vietnam, and being at one time Vice-President of the\nSociety for the Reform of the Abortion Law, Chairman of the Campaign\nAgainst Racial Discrimination in Sport, and President of the\nHomosexual Law Reform Society. His support for the decriminalization\nof homosexual behavior, he once quipped, could not be thought by\nanyone acquainted with him to involve a vested interest. Ayer\u2019s\nsupport for the Labour Party came to an end with the formation of the\nSocial Democratic Party in 1981. His support for the SDP was a protest\nat the leftward trend of the Labour Party, and particularly its\nanti-Europeanism.\n\n\nThe arrangement of spending long weekends in London and some of the\nworking week in Oxford added to Ayer\u2019s turbulent domestic\nlife. In 1963 he and Dee Wells had a son, Nicholas, of whom Ayer said,\n\u201cMy love for this child has been a dominating factor in the\nremainder of my life\u201d (Rogers 1999, 278.) He formed a relationship\nwith Vanessa Lawson, whom he would see whilst in Oxford. During this\ntime, Ayer continued to be philosophically productive,\ndoing some of his most original work. The Origins of\nPragmatism was published in 1968, following this Russell and\nMoore: the Analytical Heritage (the product of the William James\nlectures he delivered at Harvard in 1970), and Probability and\nEvidence (the Dewey lectures delivered at Columbia University in\n1970). Shortly thereafter came Russell, a small paperback,\nand The Central Questions of Philosophy (1973, originally\ngiven as the Gifford Lectures at the University of St. Andrews), in\nwhich he elaborated on the sophisticated realism first put forward in\nThe Origins of Pragmatism. He visited Canada on a couple of\noccasions, giving the Gilbert Ryle lectures at Trent University (1979)\nresulting in his book on Hume, and the Whidden lectures at McMaster\n(1983) giving rise to Freedom and Morality.\n\n\nShortly after being divorced from Dee Wells, Ayer married Vanessa\nLawson in 1982. Shortly before that Renee, his first wife, had died\n(1980), followed by Valerie, their daughter, who died suddenly of\nHodgkin\u2019s disease in 1981. Tragically Vanessa was to die of liver\ncancer in 1985, leaving Ayer grief-stricken. He himself had a close\nencounter with death, being \u2018technically\u2019 dead for a few\nminutes after choking on a piece of smoked salmon. On reviving he\nreported his experience whilst \u2018dead\u2019 in such a way as to\nprovide fodder for those who thought the famous atheist had recanted\nand found God. He moved quickly to dispel these rumours. By this time\nhe had become something of a philosophical Grand Old Man, with volumes\npublished in his honour, and a full-length critical study by John\nFoster in the prestigious Routledge \u201carguments of the\nphilosophers\u201d series. He spent most of the remaining couple of\nyears responding to articles that were to appear in the Ayer volume in\nthe Library of Living Philosophers series, edited by L.E. Hahn. He\nremarried Dee Wells, but not long afterwards Ayer was admitted to\nhospital with a collapsed lung in the early summer of 1989 and died on the\n27th, June.\n\n\nAyer wrote two autobiographies, Part of My Life, and More\nof My Life. His circle of friends included many famous and\ninfluential people; the following (in no particular order) is only a\nbrief list. Cyril Connolly, Graham Greene, George Orwell, ee cummings\nand his wife Marianne, Meyer Schapiro, Arthur Koestler, Bertrand\nRussell, Stephen Spender, W.H. Auden, Philip Toynbee, Isaiah Berlin,\nHugh Gaitskell, Roy Jenkins, Michael Foot, Richard Crossman, Jonathan\nMiller, Angus Wilson, Alan Bennett, Alice Thomas Ellis, Joan Fontaine,\nIris Murdoch, V.S. Pritchett, and Christopher Hitchens. He believed,\nmaybe truly, that the character of George Moore in Tom\nStoppard\u2019s play Jumpers was modeled on him. Ayer was a\nvain man whose vanity was part of his considerable charm. He made a\ndistinction between vanity and egotism; an egotist, he said, thought\nhe should have more medals, whilst a vain person just enjoyed showing\noff the medals he had. Among the many \u2018medals\u2019 given to\nAyer were his knighthood, Fellow of the British Academy, honorary\nmember of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Member of the\nBulgarian Order of Cyril and Methodius, 1st class, and\nChevalier of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur.\n2. Meaning and Truth\n2.1 Meaning\n\n\nThe empiricist basis of Ayer\u2019s attitude to meaning was laid first in\nhis reading of Hume. The thought that no idea had any empirical\nsignificance unless it was suitably related to an impression stayed\nwith him, and was reinforced both by his reading of Wittgenstein\u2019s\nTractatus and by the time spent in Vienna with the Logical\nPositivists. His first formulation of a criterion of meaning, the\nprinciple of verification, was in the first edition of LTL\n(1936), where he claimed that all propositions were analytic\n(true in virtue of their meaning) or else either strongly verifiable\nor weakly verifiable. Strong verification required that the truth of a\nproposition be conclusively ascertainable; weak verification required\nonly that an observation statement be deducible from the proposition\ntogether with other, auxiliary, propositions, provided that the\nobservation statement was not deducible from these auxiliaries\nalone. This rapidly proved defective: any proposition P\nconjoined with \u2018if P then O\u2019, where\n\u2018O\u2019 is an observation statement, will yield\nO, without this being deducible from \u2018if P\nthen O\u2019 alone. So in the second edition Ayer amended\nthe principle to read: a statement is directly verifiable if it is\neither an observation statement or is such that an observation\nstatement is derivable from it in conjunction with another observation\nstatement (or observation statements), such derivability not being\npossible from the conjoined observation statement(s) alone. And a\nstatement is indirectly verifiable if, first, in conjunction with\ncertain other premises it entails one or more directly verifiable\nstatements that are not derivable from these other premises alone,\nand, second, that these other premises \u201cdo not include any\nstatement that is not either analytic, or directly verifiable, or\ncapable of being independently established as indirectly\nverifiable.\u201d (LTL 2nd ed. P. 17).\n\n\nThis principle generated further criticism, most significantly from\nAlonzo Church (1949), who claimed to show that, again, it allowed\nany statement to be meaningful. Take O1,\nO2, and O3 as logically\nindependent observation statements, and S any statement\nwhatsoever. Then\n\n\n(1) (\u00acO1&O2) v\n(O3&\u00acS)\n\n\nis directly verifiable, as (1) in conjunction with\nO1 entails O3. S\nbecomes indirectly verifiable, as O2 follows from\nS and (1), and (1) is directly verifiable. Should\nO2 follow from (1) alone, then\nO2 follows from\nO3&\u00acS, which means that\n\u00acS is directly verifiable (O2 and\nO3&\u00acS being logically\nindependent).\n\n\nDespite the failure of these attempts to provide a rigorous empiricist\ncriterion of meaning, Ayer continued to hold that there was a close\nconnection between evidence and meaning, maintaining that a\nsatisfactory account of confirmation was needed before a fool-proof\ncriterion of empirical meaning could be supplied. Given later doubts\nabout whether any theory of confirmation could provide a foundation\nfor a theory of meaning (Quinean doubts relating to the impossibility\nof ruling out any facts as possibly bearing on the truth of any\nsentence), it remains unclear as to how the evidence-meaning\nconnection can be circumscribed. (For a review of other attacks on,\nand adjustments to, the verification principle, see Wright 1986,\n1989.)\nIn addition to the technical difficulties surrounding the proper\nformulation of the meaning-criterion, Ayer later acknowledged that he\nhad been vague as to whether the criterion was intended in a \u2018weak\u2019 or\n\u2018strong\u2019 sense: if weak, verifiability merely demarcated sense from\nnonsense, whilst the strong version meant that the method of\nverification provided the meaning of the sentence. It was the strong\nversion that was used in his discussion of the meaning of sentences\nabout the past and other minds, but in his discussion of the latter\nanother difficulty emerged. It had not been made clear whether the\n\u2018method of verification\u2019 was intended to be neutral between people\nemploying the sentences in question, and so provide a standard meaning\nfor these sentences, or whether such a method could provide an\nidiosyncratic meaning for one individual\u2019s use of the sentence, the\nmethod of verification being peculiar to that person. In his\ndiscussion of mental experiences, Ayer had implicitly taken the second\nroute, and so sentences attributing such experiences to himself were\ngiven a \u2018mentalistic\u2019 analysis, and those attributing experiences to\nothers were given a behaviorist analysis (see the introduction to the\nsecond edition of LTL. At the same time, however, he construed\nanother\u2019s self-attribution of experience mentalistically, whereas, as\nhe later acknowledged, to be consistent these should also have been\ngiven a behaviorist analysis (see the discussion between Bernard Williams and\nAyer in Macdonald 1979).\n\n\nThe strong interpretation of the criterion required there to be some\ndecision made as to what evidence contributed to the meaning of\nverifiable sentences. For Ayer it was clear that not all evidence for\na statement was to be included in the meaning of the statement: a\nstatement about the blood on Jack\u2019s jacket was not included in the\nmeaning of the assertion that Jack was the murderer. Further, although\nonly present evidence is available to anybody making a statement about\nthe past, the meaning of such a statement is not restricted to such\npresent evidence; one is entitled to include in the meaning evidence\nthat would be available if one were able to transport oneself to that\npast time. Moral statements were, in Ayer\u2019s view, not verifiable, and\nso could not be construed as assertions of fact, being interpreted\ninstead as expressions of emotion. This is examined again in Section\n7.\n\n\nThe only class of statements that Ayer allowed to be meaningful\nwithout such a connection to evidence was that comprised of\ntautologies, which included all analytic propositions. These were the\nonly propositions knowable a priori, their meaning being\ndependent on how language was used, and on the conventions governing\nthat use. Ayer insisted that the necessity attaching to these\npropositions was only available once the conventions governing\nlanguage-use were in play.\n2.2 Truth\n\n\nIn LTL Ayer, following Ramsey (as he thought, but see Field\n1986 for a dissenting view), put forward a redundancy (deflationary)\nview of truth: \u201c\u2026in all sentences of the form\n\u2018p is true\u2019, the phrase \u2018is true\u2019 is\nlogically superfluous\u201d (LTL p. 117). The function of\nsuch a phrase is simply to mark an assertion (or denial, in the case\nof \u2018is false\u2019), so there is no \u2018real\u2019 relation\nof truth, and so no problem of truth for philosophers to worry\nabout. Similarly, when we say a proposition is probable, or probably\ntrue, we are not assigning any intrinsic property to the proposition,\nnor saying that there is any relation it bears to any other\nproposition. We are simply expressing our confidence in that\nproposition, or, more accurately, it expresses the degree of\nconfidence it is rational to possess in the proposition.\n\n\nThis deflationary attitude to truth was supported by his\nverificationism about meaning; Ayer did not have to provide\ntruth-conditions for the meaning of sentences. Assertions had meaning\nin virtue of their verification conditions, and propositions were\ndefined just as an equivalence class of sentences with the same\nverification conditions.\n\n\nDeflationism about truth replaces a concern for a substantial theory\nof truth with a concern about which sentences, or utterances, are\ndeemed to be truth-apt. Ayer denied that moral utterances were\ntruth-apt. Given that he thought that asserting that p was\nequivalent to saying that p was true, he had to deny that\nmoral utterances could be assertions (see section 7).\n\n\nSee the entry\n on the deflationary theory of truth\n for further discussion.\n3. Perception\n\n\nIn his early work on perception Ayer espoused a strict form of\nphenomenalism, defending the view that statements about material\nobjects are translatable into statements about actual and possible\n\u2018sense-contents\u2019. These latter statements were the\nultimate verifiers, forming the basis upon which our empirical world\nwas constructed. Although he later abandoned the reductionism inherent\nin the translatability requirement (beginning with\n\u201cPhenomenalism\u201d in 1947), believing that he had been wrong\nto think that any statement about a physical object could be entailed\nby a set of statements about sensory experience (sense-data), Ayer\ncontinued to hold that our claims about physical objects were\njustified by reference to such sensory experience. He consistently\nopposed the view, espoused by Rudolf Carnap, Otto Neurath, and Karl\nPopper, that the only justifiers were sentences, whether\nNeurath\u2019s \u2018protocols\u2019 or Popper\u2019s \u2018basic\nstatements\u2019. His criticism of such views was that the favoured\nclass of statements could not be picked out in the right way without\nan appeal to relevant experience. So a criterion for membership of the\nfavored class of statements that required only those statements\naccepted by the scientists of the time to be members of the class was\nnot going to be successful without knowing which sentences were thus\naccepted, and this, Ayer claimed, could only be known by\nexperience. The alternative of using yet another sentence, one stating\nthat these (p,q,r, \u2026) were the\nsentences in the relevant class (those accepted by the scientists),\nwould make the foundations of science entirely arbitrary.\n\n\nEven on Ayer\u2019s later view, called \u2018sophisticated\nrealism\u2019(in Ayer 1973), where our perception of physical objects\nwas indirect, the ultimate bases for perceptual judgments were\nsense-data, which were now called \u2018qualia\u2019 (or, if\nparticularized, \u2018percepts\u2019). It was this continuing\ncommitment to sense-data as the objects of perception that drew J.L.\nAustin\u2019s (often sarcastic) criticism in Sense and Sensibilia\n(1962). On Ayer\u2019s view, qualia formed the patterns constituting a primary\nsystem, and it was on the basis of this system that we posited the\nexistence of physical objects, this being the\n\u2018theoretical\u2019 secondary system. Once we have this theory,\nwe are able reinterpret the quale as mental states and claim that they\nare caused by the physical objects. This causal claim is only merited\nonce the theoretical system is in place, and so cannot be a primitive\nelement in any account of perception. The physical objects are\nrequired to be there before any causal hypothesis involving them makes\nsense.\n\n\nPart, but only a part, of Ayer\u2019s reason for embracing such indirect\nrealism was what has been called the argument from illusion, the\ncentral idea of which is that, for any perceptual state of ours, we\ncould be in a state indiscriminable from it but which did not involve\nperception of any material object or scene, it being an illusion that\nthere was any such object or scene to be perceived. That is,\nnon-veridical perceptions could share their intrinsic properties with\nveridical perceptions, this possibility leading Ayer to claim that it\nwas plausible that the object of perception in both cases was\n(non-material) experience, and not, as na\u00efve realism would have\nit, the physical objects themselves. As a consequence, ordinary\nperceptual judgments, those making claims about such objects, go\nbeyond what is \u2018strictly available\u2019 in our perceptual\nexperience, and so they form a theory about that which is available to\nperception.\n\n\nThere are many ways of querying Ayer\u2019s conclusion. Austin attacked the\nway he saw the argument from illusion being deployed. He questioned\njust about everything in it: the distinction between veridical and\nnon-veridical perception, the supposed generalization from \u2018some\n(real) perceptual experience is indiscriminable from a (mere)\nperceptual appearance\u2019 to \u2018all such perceptions are\nindiscriminable from their counterpart appearances\u2019, and the\nassumption that when we have defective perceptions there are\nnon-material objects of those perceptions, sense-data.\n\n\nStrawson (1979) argued that the primary system, that purporting to\ndescribe no more than what was \u2018strictly available\u2019 to\nperception, could only be described using concepts available to those\nalready acquainted with the secondary system. A consequence of this,\nhe claimed, was that the secondary system embodied in ordinary\nperceptual judgments could not be a theory with respect to which the\nprimary system was the data \u2013 the data have to be describable in\nterms that do not presuppose the very theory for which they are the\ndata.  Although, he argued, it may be possible, though difficult, for\nus to strip our vocabulary describing our experience of such\nsecondary-system concepts, such an effort on our part would be\nunusual, and not at all like what is involved in our common-sense\nperceptual judgments, those that Ayer supposes to be the result of\nsome theorizing on our part. For Strawson, our commitment to a\nconceptual scheme of a realist character is \u2018something given\nwith the given\u2019 (Strawson 1979, p. 47).\n\n\nAyer was unmoved by the objections. He replied to Austin\u2019s attack in\n\u201cHas Austin Refuted Sense-data Theory\u201d (Ayer 1967), with\nAyer defending the viability of the distinction between veridical and\nnon-veridical perception, and maintaining that the argument from\nillusion was only one source of the case for sense-data.  (For an\nin-depth discussion of the dispute between Austin and Ayer, see Mike\nThau, \u201cWhat is Disjunctivism\u201d 2004). Against Strawson\n(\u201cReplies\u201d 1979) he noted that there was considerable\nagreement between them: in particular, they both agreed that\nperceptual judgments contain implications going beyond those carried\nby a \u2018strict\u2019 account of our sensible experience. The\ndisagreement was primarily about whether the perceptual judgments were\nbased on, or were inferred from, awareness of sense-data. Ayer\nconceded that such an inference would be only implicit. The point\nabout language he conceded as well, maintaining only that the\nassumptions often built into concepts descriptive of physical objects\n\u2013 the accessibility of such objects to other observers, that\nthey continued to exist unperceived, and so on, would not be in play\nwhen these concepts were used to provide the \u2018strict\u2019\naccount of perceptual experience.\n4. Induction and Probability\n\n\nHume was an influential figure in the formation of Ayer\u2019s\nphilosophical views, so it is no surprise to find Ayer\u2019s approach to\ninductive inference modeled on Hume\u2019s. Ayer defined inductive\ninference in negative terms, as involving all factual inference in\nwhich the premises did not entail the conclusion. All such inferences,\nAyer claimed, presumed the uniformity of nature, an assumption he put\nin terms of assuming that the future will, in relevant respects,\nresemble the past (1956, p. 72). To unambiguously cover cases of\nretrodiction, the assumption is better put in terms of the unobserved\nresembling, in relevant respects, the observed. Ayer agreed with Hume\nthat relying on any \u2018principle\u2019 of the uniformity of\nnature was not going to help justify inductive inference, given that\nsuch a principle was itself not demonstrable. A similar argument\napplied to any other principles that may have been thought to supply\nthe missing ingredient, such as an appeal to universal causality, or\nto laws of nature. These were also not demonstrably true, so would\nrequire justification themselves, and any appeal to these principles\nin such a justification would be viciously circular.\n\n\nThe fundamental problem here is that the inductive gap can be closed\nonly if the premises can somehow be made to entail their conclusion,\nand Ayer denied that this could be done. Na\u00efve realism tried to\ndo it by making the evidence \u2018move up\u2019 to the conclusion\n\u2013 by making it the case that in perception our evidence was\ndirectly of physical objects, rather than of sense-data from which\nphysical objects were inferred. This could work, if it did, only for\nperception, and not for other inductive inferences. Reductive attempts\nto close the gap tried to make the conclusion \u2018move down\u2019\nto the premises, as in phenomenalism. Ayer by now thought\nphenomenalism was unsuccessful in this attempt, and again reductionism\nwould not work for the future cases. In his 1956 he thought that the\nbest we could do was to admit the gap and be content to describe the\nways in which we actually went about justifying such inferences.\n\n\nAyer went on in later work to examine the problem of induction in\ngreater detail, in particular in relation to attempts to make the\nproblem tractable by appeal to notions of probability. In 1957 he\nwrote an important article attacking the idea that the logical\nconception of probability could be a useful guide to the future. Given\na proposition, a, that a horse is going to win the race, and\nvarious sources of evidence, h1,\nh2,\nh3\u2026hn, one can estimate\nthe probability of a given h1 to be\np1, given h2 to be\np2, and so on. One can also estimate the\nprobability of a given all of h1\n\u2026hn. Call this probability\npn, it being the probability of a given\nall of the evidence available to the person wishing to place a bet on\nthe horse. Which of these probabilities, asks Ayer, would it be\nrational for this person to base their bets on? Common sense dictates\nthat pn is the best estimate, but Ayer argues that\non the logical conception of probability, all of the estimates\np1\u2026pn are logically\ntrue, and so it is impossible to single out one as being\n\u2018better\u2019 than any of the others.\n\n\nAyer notes that common sense (and Carnap) say that a probability based\non \u2018total\u2019 evidence is what is needed. But why do we have\nto take into account total evidence? Given that all of the different\nestimates are logically true, there can be nothing wrong in relying on\none rather than another. Saying that if one takes into account all the\navailable evidence one is more likely to be right is equivalent to\nsaying that the hypothesis that \u2018those with total\nevidence\u2019 are more often right has a certain probability, and\nthat gets us no further forward. Ayer took this result as a reason to\nreject the logical interpretation of probability statements, a\nrejection repeated in his more extended treatment of probability in\nProbability and Evidence 1972, and again in his reply to J.L.\nMackie\u2019s attempt to rebut his objections (see Mackie 1979, Ayer\n1979).\nIn Probability and Evidence Ayer also criticised the\nfrequency interpretation of probability, noting that under this\ninterpretation the probability of an event will change with any change\nin the reference class to which that event is assigned. The frequency\ninterpretation itself cannot determine whether the choice of one\nreference class over another is better for the determination of the\nrelevant probability, and so suffers from a critical defect if it is\nto be of any use in solving problems associated with inductive\ninference. (For further discussion of Ayer\u2019s views on probability and\ninduction see Bela Juhos 1969, and Foster 1985, pp.198\u2013227.)\n5. Knowledge\n\n\nIn The Problem of Knowledge (1956), Ayer defended a\ncontext-based account of knowledge that had as its essential\ningredients that some claim, p, counted as knowledge for a\nperson, A, iff p was true, A was sure that\np, and A had, in the relevant context, \u2018the\nright to be sure\u2019 about the truth of p. The contextual\nelement is apparent in the discussion after Ayer outlines what is\nrequired to have the \u2018right to be sure\u2019 in the\nmathematical case. One avenue to knowledge in this case lies in the\nability of the agent to provide a proof of the relevant\nproposition. In the case of perception, or memory, it is clear that it\nis impossible to possess such a proof, so a more relaxed standard is\nrequired. To state in general how strong the backing needs to\nbe for a believer to have the right to be sure that their belief is\ntrue is not possible; doing so would require drawing up a list of\nconditions \u201cunder which perception, or memory, or testimony, or\nother forms of evidence are reliable.\u201d (1956, p. 32.) Ayer\nthought this would be too complicated a task, if at all possible. The\n\u2018correct\u2019 standard to set for claims to knowledge is to be\ndecided pragmatically, on grounds of practical convenience. The\nskeptic\u2019s ploy of setting an impossible standard, one requiring the\nimpossibility of error, should be resisted, as one has the right to be\nsure even where error is possible.\n\n\nThe account offered was intended as an analysis of knowledge, but\nrevealingly Ayer did not require that believers be aware of how they\nhave the right to be sure. It was allowed that somebody who invariably\ncorrectly predicted the outcome of a lottery could be said to\nknow that their prediction was true, even though they, nor anyone\nelse, had any idea of how the predictions came to be reliable. Ayer\nadmitted that this case, and others like it, may cause some dispute:\nit was not clearly covered by the meaning of the term\n\u2018knowledge\u2019, and so left room for some stipulation.\n\n\nAyer\u2019s particular analysis, or one closely resembling it, came\nunder attack in a famous paper by Gettier (1963), in which\nsatisfaction of the three clauses (the truth of p, the belief\nin p, and the right to be sure that\np) was held to be insufficient for knowledge.  Gettier\u2019s\nargument requires that someone, A, could be justified in\nbelieving a false proposition, and that if A was justified in\nbelieving p and q is deducible from p, and\nA accepted q by deducing it from p, then\nA would be justified in believing q. An example used\nby Gettier has the following structure: (i) Jones owns a Ford. (ii)\nEither Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Boston. Smith believes, and\nhas ample evidence for, (i). He deduces (ii) from (i), and so is\njustified in believing (ii), even though, in fact, he has no idea of\nwhere Brown is. It turns out that (i) is false, but (ii) is true\n\u2013 unbeknownst to Smith, Brown is indeed in Boston. Gettier\nconcluded that in this case all three clauses of the analysis of\nknowledge are satisfied, but that we should judge in this case that\nSmith did not know (ii). The suggestion was that additional clauses might be needed.\n\n\nThe literature spawned by the Gettier counter-examples is huge, nearly\nall of it attempting to pin down the elusive additional\nclause(s). Ayer himself did not think that any such additional clauses\nwere needed. The counter-examples, he thought, showed that what was\nneeded was a more careful account of what \u2018being\njustified\u2019 consisted in. He disputed Gettier\u2019s claim that any\ndeduction from a justified, but false, proposition preserves\njustification. We already knew, he claimed, that the notion of having\nevidence for a claim is very difficult to elucidate; Carl Hempel\u2019s\nparadoxes succeeded in showing that. Once we had managed to throw more\nlight on the justification relation, we would see that his proposed\nanalysis was sufficient for knowledge.\n6. Necessity, Causality, and Freedom\n\n\nWe have seen that in LTL Ayer maintained that all necessary\ntruths were true in virtue of the meanings of the terms used in\nexpressing them, this in turn depending on the conventions governing\nthe use of those terms. One can see in the expression of this early\nview unease about the source of logical necessity. He describes the\nnecessity of logical truths as dependent on the rules governing the\nuse of logical constants. Although such rules are neither true nor\nfalse, they elucidate the \u201cproper\u201d use of such constants,\na formulation suggesting that the source of the necessity is deeper\nthan mere linguistic usage.\n\n\nLater, cleaving (or perhaps clinging) to his \u201call necessity is\nde dicto\u201d starting point, he consistently refused to\ncountenance any de re necessities. He strenuously resisted\nthe essentialism that became fashionable following the work of Putnam\nand Kripke in the 1970s, but his reasons for doing so were not always\nto the point. In his argument against essence-based de re\nnecessities Ayer would say that \u201cCaesar is necessarily\nhuman\u201d is not true, since he could have called his dog\n\u201cCaesar\u201d. Here he lost sight of his own insistence (in the\nIntroduction to the 2nd. Edition of LTL) that\nnecessary truths were expressed in a language whose terms had already\nbeen assigned meaning and reference, so changing the reference of\n\u201cCaesar\u201d is irrelevant to the necessary truth of a\nsentence employing the term with its \u2018normal\u2019\nreference.\n\n\nOf greater relevance was his suspicion of the move from conceivability\nto possibility, and inconceivability to impossibility, thinking that\nanswers to questions about conceivability were dependent upon the\nstate of knowledge and imaginative powers of the person entertaining\nthem. Was it inconceivable that Caesar (the Julius of old) be\nnon-human? Ayer thought it consistent with everything he knew of\nCaesar (apart from his being human) that Caesar was a robot, so he\ncould \u201ceasily conceive of it as a possibility\u201d\n(\u201cReplies\u201d p. 308). On the other hand, if asked whether\nCaesar was a tortoise, he would suspect that the word\n\u201cCaesar\u201d was here used with a different reference in mind.\nAyer buttressed this thought by suggesting that the descriptions\nsecuring the referent of the term \u201cCaesar\u201d would normally\nmake it logically inconsistent that the satisfier of the descriptions\nbe a tortoise, but that this did not establish de re\nnecessities; it does not follow that the Caesar in question\nnecessarily satisfies the descriptions associated with the\nuse of the name. To the suggestion that something other than\ndescriptions might secure the proper reference, such as the causal\norigin of the use of the term, Ayer was dismissive: \u201c\u2026the\nidea \u2026that one can explain the nature of reference by saying\nthat what makes A\u2019s use of a sign s a\nreference to an object O is its causal derivation from\nsomeone\u2019s original use of s to refer to O is a\nmanifest absurdity. If one does not understand what it is for\ns to refer to O, one is none the wiser; and if one\ndoes, the causal flummery is otiose.\u201d (\u201cReplies\u201d\n1979 p. 309.)\n\n\nAyer\u2019s rejection of these kind of de re necessities was, at\nroot, a consequence of his epistemological approach to their\nevaluation. The senses of terms, he thought, were dependent on their\nassociated descriptions, these being dependent on what we knew of\ntheir reference, and these senses accounted for the presence or\nabsence of necessity. So it is identity of sense in \u201cHesperus is\nHesperus\u201d that makes that sentence necessarily true, whilst\nabsence of sense-identity renders \u201cHesperus is\nPhosphorous\u201d contingently true. He rejected the thought that\nnatural kind terms have their sense fixed by their internal\nconstitution on the grounds that many, if not most, users of natural\nkind terms are ignorant of the nature of the relevant internal\nconstitutions. In this he is in agreement with those who recognize the\nkind of necessity arising from primary intensions (Chalmers 2004) or\n\u2018A intensions\u2019 (Jackson 1998), such intensions\nbeing determined by (some) phenomenal properties of the kinds referred\nto.\n\n\nAyer also repudiated causal necessity. Following Hume, he\nthought causation could be reduced to regularity: \u201cc\ncauses e\u201d is equivalent to \u201cwhenever c\nthen e\u201d. This latter proposition is then a law of\nnature, which is just a generalization to which we have a certain\nattitude. So contingent generalizations and laws of nature are much\nthe same; they differ only in that we rely on the latter more than the\nformer, and are prepared to treat the law as though it possessed some\nstronger modality, though in fact it does not.\n\n\nThe lack of necessity attaching to causes made Ayer\u2019s acceptance of\nhuman freedom undemanding. Having denied the existence of any causal\nnecessity it was open to Ayer to be a compatibilist: determinism could\nbe true (all action could be caused), but one could still accept that\nthis left it open as to whether the agent could have done otherwise,\ngiven that the existence of the cause did not necessitate the\naction. Ayer argued that the relevant contrast to freedom was not\ncausality, but constraint, or compulsion, which are a\n\u2018special\u2019 sort of cause. So if our actions could be caused\nwhilst not being \u2018constrained\u2019 in any way, then\ndeterminism could be true and we could still be free. It was just as\nwell that this position was available, claimed Ayer, because being\nheld morally responsible for our actions required that these be not\nthe result of sheer chance.\n\n\nThis leaves, as Ayer recognized, a problem: if freedom is possible\nbecause causes don\u2019t necessitate, then am I ever unfree?\nAyer\u2019s reply was straightforward. It is only some causes that deprive\nus of freedom; if a robber puts a pistol to my head and demands my\nmoney, he has left me without a reasonable alternative, so I am not\nmorally responsible for the action I am made to do. So to say that I\ncould have done otherwise is just to say that I would have done\notherwise had I so chosen, that my action was voluntary in the way in\nwhich the kleptomaniac\u2019s isn\u2019t, and that nobody compelled me to\nact in the way that I did. (See \u201cFreedom and Necessity\u201d,\n1954). This \u2018resolution\u2019 of the problem remains\nunsatisfactory; Ayer\u2019s type of compatibilist does not have an\nacceptable account of why it is that some causes are sufficient to\nmake my action not free, whilst others contain no such threat. As he\nsays, all causes are equally necessitating \u2013 none of them\nnecessitate, not even the \u2018special\u2019 sort of causes that,\nhe alleges, threaten our freedom.\n7. Ethics\n\n\nThe emotivism espoused by Ayer in LTL was supported by his\nbelief in the distinction between fact and value. Given, he thought,\nthat there were no moral facts to be known, there could be no\nverification of such facts, and so moral utterances could have no\ncognitive significance. And given the connection between moral\n\u2018judgment\u2019 and motivation, and the connection between\nmotivation and feeling, it was natural to see moral utterances as\nhaving the function of expressing our feelings, or\n\u2018emoting\u2019. This view, Ayer was careful to point out, was\nnot that associated with subjectivism, that in making moral claims we\nare describing our feelings. This latter view would make\nmoral claims truth-evaluable, and Ayer\u2019s moral emotivism denied that\nthey were so evaluable. So when we say: \u201cCruelty towards\nchildren is wrong\u201d we are really expressing a negative attitude\ntowards killing children, and when we say \u201cBeing kind to old\npeople is good\u201d we are expressing positive feelings towards such\nacts of kindness. The expression of such positive or negative\nfeelings, he later thought, also contained a prescriptive element, so\nin such expressions we are also encouraging others to share those\nfeelings, and to act accordingly. As this makes clear, the attitudes\nexpressed were towards classes of acts, and not particular acts.\n\n\nEmotivism was thought by some to be the reductio ad absurdum\nof the verificationist theory of meaning, and indeed it was not the\npreferred metaethical position of other positivists, some of whom\npreferred a consequentialist approach, and so emotivism could be seen\nas separable from verificationism. In fact, in the\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d to the second edition of LTL Ayer\nstated that his commitment to emotivism would survive any demise of\nhis positivism, and it later became clear that it was because Ayer\nthought moral judgments to be not fact-stating that he concluded they\nwere unverifiable (see \u201cThe Analysis of Moral Judgments\u201d\nin Ayer 1954). Emotivism was given additional support by\nC.L.Stevenson, who had developed his ideas independently of Ayer, in\nhis book Ethics and Language (1944). In subsequent decades,\nit spawned a family of what came to be called\n\u201cexpressivist\u201d views in metaethics, which sought to state\nthe view with a sensitivity to the logical problems Ayer\u2019s\nformulation raised. \n\n\nIt has been suggested (Dreier 2004) that Ayer faced a particular\ndifficulty in defending this brand of non-cognitivism; the combination\nof affirming a redundancy theory of truth with the denial that moral\nclaims can be true looks suspicious. Although the two views are not\nincompatible (Ayer denied that moral claims were assertions, and the\nredundancy of the truth-predicate held only for assertions), the\ntension between the two is symptomatic of the worry that moral claims\nhave so many of the features of truth-evaluable assertions that one\nhas to be unjustifiably revisionist in construing them as\nnon-meaningful. They are, after all, typically expressed in indicative\nsentences, and people appear to dispute moral claims. This latter\npoint Ayer did respond to: moral disagreements were, he (and\nStevenson) claimed, either genuine disputes about non-moral facts, or\nsimply not genuine disagreements.  (For an examination of the trouble\nthat moral disagreement makes for emotivism, see Smith 1986.) There\nwas, however, a further, more troubling, point about the role of moral\nterms in arguments: moral terms can be used in arguments in which the\nmoral term appears in a conditional, and so is not there contributing\nto the expressive force of the utterance, so not expressing any\nemotion of the speaker. This latter point has been developed into a\nline of reasoning (called the \u201cFrege-Geach\u201d problem)\nagainst expressivism in general.  The problem for the expressivist is\nto make sense of simple arguments such as the following: (1) If John killed\nJane, he did something wrong. (2) John killed Jane. So (3) John did\nsomething wrong. The argument appears to be valid, and so not to\ninvolve any ambiguity, but the moral term can be construed as having\nexpressive force only in (3), not in (1).  Expressivism, and so\nemotivism, seems to introduce an unwarranted equivocation into the\nargument.\n\n\nIt is perhaps these \u2018surface\u2019 features of moral discourse,\nthose that make it look like moral claims are assertions, and hence\nexpressions of belief, and so truth-evaluable, and that moral\ndisagreement appears to be genuine moral disagreement, that\nlater tempted Ayer to consider Mackie\u2019s \u2018error\u2019 theory of\nmoral language (Mackie 1977) as closer to the truth (in Ayer\n1984). The details of emotivism tended to disappear from the\nmetaethical scene in the latter half of the twentieth century, but\nits guiding thoughts have remained very much alive in the expressivism\nof Blackburn 1984, 1998, and Gibbard 1990. (See Altham, 1979, for a\nsympathetic defense of these guiding thoughts, and Schroeder, 2010,\nfor a thorough treatment of the development of expressivism, with\nparticular attention paid to subsequent attempts to tackle the Frege-Geach\nproblem.)\n",
