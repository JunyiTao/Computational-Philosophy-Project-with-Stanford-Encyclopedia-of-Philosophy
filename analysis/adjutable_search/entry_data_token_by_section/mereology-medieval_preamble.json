    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u201cmereology\u201d is sometimes used to refer to any one\nof the formal languages that describe the part-to-whole relation. In\nthis article, I will use the term more broadly to refer to any\ntheoretical study (formal or informal) of parts, wholes, and the\nrelations (logical or metaphysical) that obtain between them. In what\nfollows I will survey some of the ways that philosophers in the\nmedieval Latin West thought about parts and wholes. (While there is\nvery little contemporary scholarship on medieval Arabic, Hebrew, or\nByzantine mereology (although now see Thom 2019), many of the Latin\nnotions and distinctions surveyed in this article surely have\ncorrelates in these traditions.) The article will highlight many of\nthe key medieval mereological concepts and principles, and it will\noutline some of the fundamental issues that confront mereologists in\nthe Middle Ages. Specific philosophers and their doctrines will be\nused to illustrate some of these concepts, principles, and puzzles.\nMany of these concepts and principles may seem strange to the modern\nstudent of parts and wholes, but behind this alien veneer one will see\nthat medieval mereologists share many of our concerns about wholes,\ntheir parts, and the metaphysical implications of mereology.\n",
