    "main_text": "Technoscientific Hybridity and Fetishism\n3. Technoscientific Hybridity and Fetishism\n\nTechnology and science have had and continue to have an enormous\nimpact on the contemporary world. The weapons, medicines, automobiles,\nelectronics, and other goods they produce have been both beneficial to\nand problematic for human and non-human animal life. Important to\nunderstanding the particular impact of technology and science is to\nfocus not just on their products, however, but also on the processes\nby which those products come into existence\u2014and, moreover, not\nonly the mechanical, but also the social processes as well. The\nproducts of contemporary technoscience are hybrid compilations of\nmaterial goods, human labor, and social relations that often are\noppressive. As such, they cannot be understood if they are conceived\nof as mere things, abstracted away from their social contexts. Doing\nso interferes with the ability to ask questions about whom\ntechnoscience benefits and whom it exploits or otherwise harms.\n\nMuch of Donna Haraway\u2019s work stresses the importance of asking these\nquestions. In Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of\nNature (1991), Donna Haraway introduces the figure of the cyborg,\nan \u201cimpure\u201d creature who scrambles orderly divisions\nbetween the natural and artificial/technical, and the human and the\nnon-human/animal. Continuing her exploration of \u201contological\nconfusing bodies\u201d in\nModest_Witness@Second_Millennium.FemaleMan\u00a9_Meets_\n\nOncoMouse\u2122: Feminism and\nTechnoscience (1997, 186), Haraway speaks as a cyborgian\n\u201cmodest witness\u201d to contemporary technoscience, at once\nboth implicated in and suspicious of its processes and products.\nExtending her earlier insights into how humans \u201cpolish an animal\nmirror to look for ourselves\u201d (1991, 22), Haraway criticizes the\nway that science takes nature as a static given, congealing and\nobscuring social relations such that they can be taken as\ndecontextualized things-in-themselves. (It should be noted, however,\nthat other feminists have taken issue with Haraway\u2019s characterization\nof science. Mary Magada-Ward (2014) in particular has argued from a\npragmatic feminist perspective that Haraway\u2019s willingness to criticize\nscience as one narrative among others is irresponsible, and endangers\nthe very liberatory projects with which feminists are aligned.) \n\nFor Haraway, Western culture is extremely fetishistic, mistaking\n\u201ca fixed thing for the doings of power-differentiated lively\nbeings\u201d (1997, 135). To analyze the web of economic,\npsychological, and philosophical threads that compose this fetishism,\nHaraway appeals to the work of Marx, Freud, and Whitehead.\nEconomically, socio-technological relations often are taken to be\ncommodities whose value is intrinsic rather than the product of the\nlabor and practices of organic life. Hand-in-hand with this\npolitico-economic fetishism goes a psychological denial of this\nsubstitution that makes the \u201cmistake\u201d of taking things for\nprocesses very difficult to recognize. Finally, wound up with these\ntwo strands is the philosophical error that misunderstands concrete,\nrelational processes as fixed, simple abstractions (1997, 147). All\nthree threads of this fetishism are bound up in, for example, the\ncomputer chip, which is incredibly valuable and necessary to late\ncapitalist, technological society. Locating its value in pieces of\nmetal and plastic and electronic codes, however, we lose sight of the\nhistorical and labor processes that produce and sustain the computer\u2019s\nexistence. A product of World War II, the computer was developed to\nhelp calculate artillery trajectories so that bombs would be more\neffective (read: destroy more property and kill more people). Today,\ncomputer chips and mother boards often are produced by Asian women in\nthe U.S. and various third-world countries, who are seen as especially\nappropriate for such jobs because of their \u201cOriental\u201d\nnimble finger work and attentiveness to small details (1991, 154,\n177). When we fetishize the chip, we are incapable of seeing this\n\u201cfinal appropriation of women\u2019s bodies in a masculinist orgy of\nwar\u201d (1991, 154). That is to say, we render ourselves incapable\nof understanding how the materials, processes, and concerns of a\nhighly militarized, technoscientific culture shape the world and our\nvery selves.\n\nThe process philosophy of Whitehead subtly provides crucial support\nfor Haraway\u2019s analysis of fetishism and, indeed, much of her critique\nof technoscience. As Haraway explains in a footnote to\nModest_Witness (1997, 297n21), Whitehead has been important\nto her work since at least her days as a graduate student, and she\nbelieves that the general thrust of his ideas can be discerned in a\ngreat deal of feminist science studies and philosophy of science. For\nWhitehead, everything in the world is a \u201cconcrescence of\nprehensions,\u201d prehensions being the grasping or feeling of one\nthing by another in their on-going relations of becoming (1997, 47). A\nconcrescence of prehensions, then, is a growing together of processes\nof becoming that allows some relations to function as a unified,\ndistinct thing, or \u201cactual entity.\u201d What Whitehead calls\nthe fallacy of misplaced concreteness occurs when abstract logical\nconstructions\u2014such as the notion of a thing\u2019s primary qualities\nor of its simple location in space-time\u2014are (mis)taken for the\nconcreteness of processual, actual entities. The effect of this\nmistake, in Haraway\u2019s terms, is the fetishization of things. Allying\nherself with Whitehead, Haraway emphasizes the prehensional\n\u201creachings into each other in the tissues of the world\u201d\n(1997, 147)\u2014for example, genes, computer chips, fetuses,\nOncoMouse\u2122\u2014that are the concrete, actual materials of\nWestern technoscience.\n\nAlthough she argues against fetishism, it would be misleading to\nconclude that Haraway is thus also arguing \u201cfor\u201d the\nontologically messy hybridity that results when one gives fetishism\nup. Neither, however, is Haraway \u201cagainst\u201d hybridity. Both\nof these positions are too categorical for the issue at hand. In\nHaraway\u2019s view, hybridity presents possible dangers and potential\nbenefits alike and thus must be examined in its various\nparticularities. Haraway\u2019s task, thus, is to pragmatically ask,\n\u201cfor whom and how [do] these hybrids work?\u201d (1997, 280 n1)\nWho benefits, for example, from OncoMouse\u2122, the mouse with human\ngenes for developing breast cancer that has been developed and\ntrademarked by DuPont? This question not only points to the issue of\nhuman beings\u2019 taking \u201cnoninnocent responsibility\u201d for the\nuse of non-human animals as research tools (1997, 82). It also points\nto questions about environmental toxins, environmental racism, and the\navailability and affordability of health care for African American\nwomen in light of their increasing death rates from cancer while those\nof white women remain the same (1997, 113). Asking questions such as\nthese would help enable contemporary technoscience to engage in\npractices of \u201cwitnessing,\u201d that is to \u201cstan[d]\npublicly accountable for, and psychically vulnerable to [its]\nvisions and representations\u201d (1997, 267). For Haraway, such\naccountability would open up the possibility that technosciences\n\u201cknowledge products\u201d might at the same time be\n\u201cfreedom projects\u201d as well (1997, 269).\n",
