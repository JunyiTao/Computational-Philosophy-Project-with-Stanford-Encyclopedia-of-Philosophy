    "main_text": "\n\nPopulation genetics is a field of biology that studies the genetic\ncomposition of biological populations, and the changes in genetic\ncomposition that result from the operation of various factors,\nincluding natural selection. Population geneticists develop abstract\nmathematical models of gene frequency dynamics, extract predictions\nabout the likely patterns of genetic variation in actual populations,\nand test the predictions against empirical data. A number of the more\nrobust generalizations to emerge from population-genetic analysis are\ndiscussed below.\n\nPopulation genetics is intimately bound up with the study of evolution\nand natural selection, and is often regarded as the theoretical\ncornerstone of evolutionary biology. This is because\n\u201cevolution\u201d has traditionally been defined as any\nchange in a population\u2019s genetic composition (though this\ndefinition has been criticized); and natural selection is one\nimportant factor (though not the only one) that can lead to such a\nchange. Natural selection occurs when some variants in a population\nout-reproduce other variants as a result of being better adapted to\nthe environment, or \u2018fitter\u2019. Presuming the fitness\ndifferences are at least partly due to genetic differences, this will\ncause the population\u2019s genetic makeup to change, as the genetic\nvariants associated with higher fitness increase in frequency. By\ndevising models of gene frequency change, population geneticists are\nthus able to shed light on the genetic basis of evolutionary change, and to\npermit the consequences of different evolutionary hypotheses to be\nexplored in a quantitatively precise way.\n\nPopulation genetics came into being in the 1920s and 1930s, thanks to\nthe work of R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright. Their\nachievement was to integrate the principles of Mendelian genetics,\nwhich had been rediscovered at the turn of century, with Darwinian\nnatural selection. Though the compatibility of Darwinism with\nMendelian genetics is today taken for granted, in the early years of\nthe twentieth century it was not. Many of the early Mendelians did not\naccept Darwin\u2019s \u2018gradualist\u2019 account of evolution,\nbelieving instead that novel adaptations must arise in a single\nmutational step; conversely, many of the early Darwinians did not\nbelieve in Mendelian inheritance, often because of the erroneous\nbelief that it was incompatible with the process of evolutionary\nmodification as described by Darwin. By working out mathematically the\nconsequences of selection acting on a population obeying the Mendelian\nrules of inheritance, Fisher, Haldane and Wright showed that Darwinism\nand Mendelism were not just compatible but excellent bed fellows; this\nplayed a key part in the formation of the \u2018neo-Darwinian\nsynthesis\u2019, and explains why population genetics came to occupy\nso pivotal a role in evolutionary theory.\n\nPopulation genetics is an important branch of science, but why should\nphilosophers care about it? There are a number of reasons. Firstly,\nDarwinian evolution has long been a fruitful source of ideas for\nphilosophers working in a variety of areas, including philosophy of\nmind, ethics and political philosophy. (Recall Darwin\u2019s famous\ncomment \u201che who understands baboon would do more for metaphysics\nthan Locke\u201d). To properly understand evolution requires a grasp\nof basic population genetics, which provides one motivation for\nphilosophers to learn about this field. Secondly, population genetics\nis a possible \u201ctesting ground\u201d for ideas developed in\ngeneral philosophy of science about idealization, explanation, the\nrole of abstract models, and the interplay between theory and data.\nThirdly, population genetics features prominently in many debates in\nphilosophy of biology over issues including the nature of evolutionary\ncausation, the logic of selective explanation, the role of chance in\nevolution, and the relation between population-level and\nindividual-level processes. Finally, population genetics is indirectly\nrelevant to certain other philosophical debates, such as the debate\nover the reality of biological race, for example.\n\nThe discussion below is structured as follows. Section 1 briefly\noutlines the origins of population genetics, focusing on major themes\nand controversies. Section 2 explains the Hardy-Weinberg principle,\nthe starting point of much population-genetic analysis. Section 3\noutlines some elementary models in population genetics and their\nconsequences. Section 4 discusses random drift (the chance\nfluctuations in gene frequency that arise in finite populations), and\ncoalescence (the joining up of gene lineages as we trace them back in\ntime). Section 5 discusses the status of population genetics in\nbiology. Section 6 examines some of the philosophical issues raised by\npopulation genetics.\n",
