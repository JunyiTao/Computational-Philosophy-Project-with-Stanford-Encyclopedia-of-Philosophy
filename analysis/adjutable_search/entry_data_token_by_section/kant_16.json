    "main_text": "The highest good and practical postulates\n6. The highest good and practical postulates\n\nKant holds that reason unavoidably produces not only consciousness of\nthe moral law but also the idea of a world in which there is both\ncomplete virtue and complete happiness, which he calls the highest\ngood. Our duty to promote the highest good, on Kant\u2019s view, is\nthe sum of all moral duties, and we can fulfill this duty only if we\nbelieve that the highest good is a possible state of affairs.\nFurthermore, we can believe that the highest good is possible only if\nwe also believe in the immortality of the soul and the existence of\nGod, according to Kant. On this basis, he claims that it is morally\nnecessary to believe in the immortality of the soul and the existence\nof God, which he calls postulates of pure practical reason. This\nsection briefly outlines Kant\u2019s view of the highest good and his\nargument for these practical postulates in the Critique of\nPractical Reason and other works.\n",
