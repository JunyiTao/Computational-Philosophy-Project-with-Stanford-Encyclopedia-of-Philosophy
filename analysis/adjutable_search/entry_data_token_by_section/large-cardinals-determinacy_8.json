    "main_text": "Classical Descriptive Set Theory || Classical Results\n2.3  Classical Results\n\nDuring the early 20th century there were many advances\nby the French and Russian analysts in establishing that definable sets\nhad the above regularity and structural properties. We shall limit our\ndiscussion to the crowning achievements: \n\nTheorem 2.1 (Luzin, Suslin 1917).Assume ZFC. The \u03a3\u033011 sets have the perfect set property, the property of Baire, and are Lebesgue measurable. \n\n Notice that the property of Baire and Lebesgue measurability have\nthe feature that if they hold of A then they hold of the\ncomplement of A. However, the perfect set property does not\nhave this feature. It remained open whether\nall \u03a0\u033011\nsets have the perfect set property and whether\nall \u03a3\u033012\nsets have the property of Baire and are Lebesgue measurable. \n\n Theorem 2.2 (Kond\u00f4 1937). Assume ZFC. Then Unif(\u03a3\u033012) holds. \n\n\n It remained open whether all sets of reals\nin \u03a0\u033012, \u03a3\u033013,\netc. have the uniformization property. \n",
