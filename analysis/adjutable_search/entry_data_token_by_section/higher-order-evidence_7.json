    "main_text": "Accommodating the Import of Higher-Order Evidence || Level-bridging principles\n3.2 Level-bridging principles\n\nWhile Independence principles tell us what to set aside,\nlevel-bridging principles specify how our first-order beliefs should\ncohere with our higher-order beliefs. (As mentioned above, however,\nthese principles aren\u2019t always presented separately.\nLevel-bridging principles also often include some element of\nIndependence, or are meant to apply alongside an Independence\nprinciple.)\n\nSome epistemologists argue that our first-order beliefs should line up\nsomehow with our beliefs about rationality. (See Smithies\n2019 and Titelbaum 2015, 2019, for example.) Others argue that our\nfirst-order beliefs should line up somehow with our beliefs about\nreliability. And still others incorporate elements of both.\nSome literature discusses both notions together and other literature\ndistinguishes explicitly between the two. (See Christensen 2016b,\nSliwa & Horowitz 2015, and Schoenfield 2015a for a few examples of\nmore explicit discussions. See also Dorst [forthcoming] for a\ncomprehensive overview of some of the principles proposed in the\nliterature and the relationship between them, and the entry on\n epistemic self-doubt\n for discussion of some other level-bridging principles in greater\ndetail.)\n\nI will highlight the choice by first describing an intuitively\nplausible level-bridging principle that focuses on rationality, and a\nproblem case for this principle which has motivated some\nepistemologists to move towards reliability instead. Although the\nsecond principle, too, has come under criticism, the case is a useful\nillustration of some of the complications that arise in this\nchoice.\n3.2.1 Rationality-focused principles\n\nThe general thought behind rationality-focused level-bridging\nprinciples is that your beliefs about the world should line up with\nyour beliefs about what\u2019s rational for you to believe. If you\nthink it\u2019s rational to believe P (or, if it\u2019s\nrational for you to think that\u2019s rational\u2026) you should\nbelieve P. If you think it\u2019s rational to believe\n~P, you should believe ~P. This line of thought\ninvolves deferring to rationality as you would defer to an expert.\n\nWhat if you\u2019re uncertain about what\u2019s rational? Arguably,\nthis is Aisha\u2019s situation: she\u2019s unsure whether her\nevidence rationally supports G, as she initially thought it\ndid, or whether hypoxia has confused her and her evidence\ndoesn\u2019t support G after all. One initially plausible\nresponse to this sort of situation is to say that when we\u2019re\nuncertain, our beliefs should reflect a kind of weighted average of\nthe responses we take to be possibly rational. This yields the result\nthat if we\u2019re about equally confident that we should believe\nP and that we should believe ~P, the thing to do is\nto suspend judgment.\n\nThe principle Rational Reflection makes this thought more precise in a\ndegreed-belief, or \u201ccredence\u201d setting. (Christensen\n[2010b] introduces and discusses the principle at length. Salow [2018]\nand Skipper [2021] are proponents of the principle. Elga [2013] and\nDorst [2020] amend it, as we\u2019ll see later.) Roughly, according\nto Rational Reflection, one\u2019s credences (\u201cCr\u201d in the\nformulation below) should align with those that one regards as\nrational (\u201cPr\u201d):\n\n\nRational Reflection: \\(\\Cr(A\\mid \\Pr(A) = n) =\nn\\)\n\n\nIf this principle were a true rational requirement, then rational\nagents in situations like Aisha\u2019s would end up with a strong\ncoherence between their first-order beliefs and their beliefs about\nwhat is rational. Rational Reflection says, for instance, that it\ncannot be rational for Aisha to be rationally certain that it\nis rational to have .9 confidence in G, without also\nhaving .9 confidence in G. And it cannot be rational for\nAisha to be uncertain, without also adopting a weighted average of the\ncredences that she regards as possibly rational (weighted by her\ncredence, in each, that it is rational). In the version of the case\ndiscussed in the introduction, one might interpret Aisha\u2019s\nhigher-order evidence as indicating that her high confidence in\nG is only 50% likely to be rational, given her first-order\nevidence. If it is 50% likely that high confidence is rational, and\n50% likely that low confidence is rational, Aisha should plausibly\nadopt the weighted average of these possibilities and arrive at a\nmiddling level of credence. Rational Reflection supports this\nexplanation of the story.\n\nHowever, Rational Reflection has counterintuitive consequences in some\ncases, such as the \u201cUnmarked Clock\u201d case, introduced in\nWilliamson (2014). Here is that case (based on the presentation in\nChristensen 2010b; see also Elga 2013; see Horowitz 2014 for a similar\ncase, discussed in connection with epistemic akrasia, and see also\nSliwa & Horowitz 2015 for a non-perceptual case with similar\nfeatures):\n\n\nThe Unmarked Clock: Chloe is looking at an unmarked\nclock with just a minute hand, which jumps discretely between its\npositions. The hand is pointing somewhere around where the 4 would be,\nif it were marked, which of course it isn\u2019t. Chloe is wondering:\nis the hand pointing to the 19? The 20? The 21? (call those\npropositions \u201cP19\u201d, \u201cP20\u201d, and\n\u201cP21\u201d).\n\n\nWilliamson, Christensen, and Elga (among others) all agree on the\nfollowing about this case:\n\n(1)\nChloe shouldn\u2019t be certain of any of P19, P20, or P21.\n(2)\nChloe\u2019s credence in whichever of these propositions is\nactually her evidence should be highest, and should taper off as\npossibilities become more remote. (In other words, if the hand is\nreally at 20 minutes after the hour, she should have highest credence\nin P20, a bit lower credence in P19 and P21, and lower credence still\nin P18 and P22.)\n\n\nAnd finally,\n\n(3)\nChloe can figure out all of these facts about her epistemic\nsituation simply by thinking about the setup of the case, as we just\nhave.\n\n\nThe problem is that (1), (2), and (3) together entail that Chloe\nshould violate Rational Reflection.\n\nHere is why: suppose the hand is at 20 minutes after the hour, and\nChloe\u2019s credence is in fact distributed as it should be, with\nP20 receiving the highest value. Since Chloe is rational, then by\n (2)\n above, she should also give significant credence to P19 and P21. Now\nconsider the implications for what Chloe thinks her credence\nshould be. In P20, Chloe\u2019s current credence is\nrational. But in P19 and P21 (which we have just said she gives\nsignificant credence to), her current credence in P20 is too high. So\nshe is in a position to conclude the following about her credence in\nP20: it\u2019s definitely not too low, but it may well be too high.\nThis unbalanced state violates Rational Reflection, and also looks\nlike an instance of epistemic akrasia.\n\nAdam Elga (2013) argues that this sort of situation motivates a\ndifferent principle, which he calls \u201cNew Rational\nReflection\u201d (following Ned Hall\u2019s \u201cNew Principal\nPrinciple\u201d, and the argument in favor of it; see Hall 1994).\nElga argues that just as we should not in general defer (directly) to\nexperts when we know more than they do, we should not in general defer\nto rationality in cases where it is rational to doubt one\u2019s\nrationality. If we use \u201cCr\u201d for an agent\u2019s credence,\nand \u201cPr\u201d for a candidate ideally rational credence, we can\nexpress Elga\u2019s principle as follows:\n\n\nNew Rational Reflection: \\(\\Cr(A\\mid \\textrm{Pr is\nideal}) = \\Pr(A\\mid \\textrm{Pr is ideal})\\)\n\n\nBoth Rational Reflection and New Rational Reflection have us defer to\nrationality as we would defer to an expert. But whereas Rational\nReflection has us defer to rationality as an expert with exactly\nour evidence, New Rational Reflection has us defer to rationality\nas an expert who has our evidence and is certain that it is an\nexpert. Elga argues that this is the right way to defer to\nexperts more generally, making New Rational Reflection (on his view)\nsimply a more carefully-formulated expert deference principle. (See\nPettigrew & Titelbaum 2014 for a concurrent view.)\n\nIn the clock case, New Rational Reflection also allows for epistemic\nakrasia: Chloe\u2019s beliefs about the clock come apart from her\nestimate of what\u2019s rational for her to believe about the clock.\nBut New Rational Reflection offers us an explanation for why this is\nunproblematic. In normal cases, what\u2019s rational is a\ngood guide to what\u2019s true: if it\u2019s rational to\nbelieve it will rain, it\u2019s also likely to be true that it will\nrain. But in the clock case, this generality doesn\u2019t hold. We\ncan predict that rationality and truth will come apart. So when\nChloe\u2019s belief matches her best estimate of what\u2019s true,\nit will diverge from her best estimate of what\u2019s rational.\nFurthermore, this divergence comes about because of uncertainty about\nwhat\u2019s rational. So by eliminating that uncertainty\u2014by\ndeferring to rationality only on the condition that rationality is not\nuncertain about its own expertise\u2014New Rational Reflection aims\nto eliminate that gap between rationality and truth. (See Elga 2013,\nas well as Horowitz 2014, for further discussion of this feature of\nthe case.)\n\nSeveral authors agree with this line of thought, accepting both the\nsetup of the clock case and Elga\u2019s general line of thought\nregarding how it should be treated. These authors take the clock case\nto be one in which epistemic akrasia is rationally permissible after\nall, showing that any anti-akrasia norms must be formulated carefully.\nFor similar discussion, see Horowitz\u2019s (2014) discussion of the\ndartboard case (which is modeled after the unmarked clock). There,\nHorowitz argues that epistemic akrasia is rationally permissible when\nwe expect the evidence to be \u201cfalsity-guiding\u201d; though see\nWeatherson (2019: ch. 10), and Hawthorne, Isaacs, and Lasonen-Aarnio\n(2021) for arguments that this condition is too narrow. Sliwa and\nHorowitz (2015) present an alternative level-bridging principle,\n\u201cEvidential Calibration\u201d, and argue that, like New\nRational Reflection, it can help differentiate between rational and\nirrational cases of epistemic akrasia, as well as rule out\nbootstrapping. Christensen (2016a) proposes what he calls the\n\u201cIdealized Thermometer Model\u201d, and makes similar points in\nits favor. Dorst (2020; see also his 2019) proposes another principle,\n\u201cTrust\u201d, which is a weakening of Rational Reflection.\nDorst argues that Trust allows us to be uncertain about rationality,\nwhile still treating rationality as an expert; this vindicates the\nidea that we should defer to our evidence, and (following I. J. Good)\nthat more evidence is always epistemically beneficial. All of these\nlevel-bridging principles take higher-order evidence into account, but\nalso allow some instances of epistemic akrasia.\n\nIf we agree with this line of thought, we might draw two lessons.\nFirst: treating rationality as an expert is a complicated job, and any\nrational expert deference principle must be formulated carefully. If\nwe can predict that rationality and truth will come apart, we should\nnot defer unrestrictedly to rationality. And relatedly, we might take\ncases like this to show that epistemic akrasia can be rational: it can\ncrop up even on some views according to which higher-order evidence is\nepistemically significant.\n\nSome epistemologists disagree with these lessons, and moreover, with\nthe entire setup of the clock case. One camp of detractors objects to\nclaims\n (1),\n (2), and\n (3)\n as set out above. These epistemologists argue that we cannot be\nrationally uncertain about what our evidence is (as Chloe is) or about\nwhat it supports. See, for example, Stalnaker (2009), Smithies (2019:\nch. 11), and Skipper (2021). Salow (2018) argues that the conception\nof evidence required to get the puzzle going can be used to allow\n\u201cbiased inquiry\u201d. Cases like the unmarked clock thus\npresent a choice point for epistemologists who want to accommodate\nhigher-order defeat: accept that such cases are possible and reject\nRational Reflection, or reject such cases and adopt a strong\ntransparency requirement about evidence and rationality.\n\nOthers disagree from the opposite side: Maria Lasonen-Aarnio (2015)\nargues that even the modified principle, New Rational Reflection,\npresupposes too much self-knowledge. She advocates rejecting all\nlevel-bridging principles, at least as far as our theory of evidential\nsupport is concerned (though see\n section 4\n for discussion of her view on cases like Aisha\u2019s).)\n\nFinally, Christensen (2021a) argues that New Rational Reflection\ndoesn\u2019t go far enough. New Rational Reflection says we should\ndefer, to some extent, to any theory of rationality we think\nmight possibly be right. But what if we think it\u2019s possible that\nrationality can come apart from the truth\u2014as it does in the\nclock case, or even more broadly, as it does on views that allow moral\nencroachment? (On the extreme end, consider views on which rationality\nis about believing what makes you happy.) Surely we should not defer\nto them, even a little bit. (If one of them is right, of course, we\nshould follow it\u2014but the present question is just about\nwhether we should treat different candidates for rationality as\nexperts.) So Christensen argues we should reject New Rational\nReflection, and focus on attaining beliefs we take to be\naccurate, rather than beliefs we take to be rational. This\nmay mean moving away entirely from rationality-focused level-bridging\nprinciples.\n3.2.2 Reliability-focused principles\n\nSo far we have focused on Rational Reflection and New Rational\nReflection, which are motivated by the thought that in accommodating\nhigher-order evidence, we should calibrate our first-order beliefs to\nour higher-order beliefs about rationality. Another way to\napproach the question begins with reliability. The thought\nhere is that higher-order evidence affects our first-order beliefs\nbecause of its bearing on our reliability\u2014that is, our\npropensity to get to the truth, under the relevant\ncircumstances. Examples of this approach include Elga\u2019s\n\u201cEqual Weight View\u201d, quoted above; Christensen\n(2007a)\u2019s \u201cIntegration\u201d; the \u201cCalibration\nRule\u201d, discussed by White (2009); Weatherson\u2019s\n(ms\u2014see Other Internet Resources) \u201cJudgments Screen\nEvidence\u201d (which he argues against); \u201cGuess\nCalibration\u201d, discussed in Sliwa and Horowitz 2015;\n\u201cCalibration\u201d, discussed in Schoenfield 2015a; and the\n\u201cSimple Thermometer Model\u201d discussed in Christensen 2016a.\nAs a representative example, here is White\u2019s \u201cCalibration\nRule\u201d, which he presents as a consequence of the Equal Weight\nView:\n\n\nCalibration Rule: If I draw the conclusion p\non the basis of any evidence e, my credence in p\nshould equal my prior expected reliability with respect to\np.\n\n\nThere are various complications involved in interpreting this rule\n(for instance, it refers to \u201cdrawing a conclusion\u201d, which\nis an all-or-nothing judgment, as well as credences). But notice that,\nunlike Rational Reflection, the Calibration Rule makes no reference to\nrationality. (It does specify that the conclusion is drawn on\nthe basis of some evidence, but as White points out in his discussion\nof the rule, the evidence plays no part in determining what we should\nbelieve.)\n\nReliability-based level-bridging principles must also be formulated\ncarefully in order to navigate worries in the vicinity of the\ngenerality problem. (Among other things, one\u2019s reliability\nestimate on a particular occasion must take base rates into account;\nsee Isaacs 2021.) But just as we saw before, such principles are\nalways put forth in conjunction with\u2014or incorporate some element\nof\u2014Independence principles. If we can answer the question of how\nto circumscribe Independence, presumably that will answer the\ngenerality problem in this domain as well.\n\nFocusing on reliability, rather than rationality, has advantages and\ndisadvantages. An important advantage is that this approach allows us\nto accommodate cases like the unmarked clock, discussed in the\nprevious section. But the disadvantage is that reliability-based\nlevel-bridging principles do not answer certain questions which, for\nmany epistemologists, lie at the heart of the higher-order evidence\ndebate: can epistemic akrasia be rational? And should we in some sense\ntreat rationality as an expert to which we should defer? If our\nlevel-bridging principle does not mention rationality, it will not\nhave immediate consequences for these questions, which may seem\nunsatisfying to some.\n\nDistinguishing between rationality-focused and reliability-focused\nlevel-bridging principles highlights another choice point for\nepistemologists. Some take questions about akrasia to be central, and\ndefend rationality-based level-bridging principles for that reason\n(Smithies 2019 is a paradigmatic example; see also Neta 2019).\nOthers\u2014even those who support level-bridging\u2014take cases\nlike the unmarked clock to show that these questions aren\u2019t so\ncentral after all, and that perhaps epistemic akrasia is not so\nsignificant (Christensen 2016a and 2021a are paradigmatic examples of\nthis approach). A third strategy is to say that anti-akrasia, or\nlevel-coherence principles, have a special sort of normative status\nthat differs from other rational requirements. Some of the proposals\ndiscussed in the next section defend this view.\n4. Dilemmas and Two-Norm Views\n\nWe began by discussing a puzzle raised by higher-order evidence: it\nseems that agents in situations like Hypoxia should reduce confidence,\nbut also that if they do, they will be ignoring evidence in a\nproblematic way. We have seen some arguments against reducing\nconfidence, and some proposals for how Aisha should reduce\nconfidence. But some epistemologists think that neither of these\npossibilities gives us the full story. Maybe level-bridging principles\nare genuine rational requirements, but there is still\nsomething wrong with Aisha if she reduces confidence. Or maybe they\nare not genuine rational requirements, yet there is something\nelse wrong with Aisha if she does not reduce\nconfidence. Maybe they are both rational requirements, and Aisha is\nfacing an epistemic dilemma. (An alternative way to frame the puzzle\nfocuses on epistemic akrasia: maybe Aisha is rationally required to be\nepistemically akratic in her situation, but there is something else\nwrong with her if she is epistemically akratic, and so forth.)\n\nThis section discusses two strategies which acknowledge the remaining\npuzzle and attempt to solve it. One, defended most prominently by\nDavid Christensen, holds that higher-order evidence gives rise to\nepistemic dilemmas, where there is no fully rational response\navailable (though there may be a rationally best response). So Aisha\nis both required to believe G and to doubt G, and\nshe is just unfortunately unable to do both. Another family of\nresponses, here called \u201ctwo-norm views\u201d, aim to separate\ndifferent modes of epistemic evaluation, and argue that Aisha\u2019s\nconflicting requirements somehow issue from different normative\nrealms. The common goal of all these strategies is to explain the\napparent conflict of norms in cases like Hypoxia, without denying the\nlegitimacy of any of these conflicting norms.\n4.1 Dilemmas\n\nChristensen takes the puzzles surrounding higher-order evidence to\nshow that the requirements of rationality sometimes conflict with one\nanother, putting agents like Aisha in an epistemic bind. This proposal\ndiffers from the two-norm views discussed below, in that there is just\none notion of epistemic rationality at work. According to the dilemma\nview, in some circumstances, it is impossible to satisfy all the\nrational requirements at once.(see Christensen 2007a, 2010a, 2013,\n2016b, and 2021c). In his more recent work (see Christensen 2021c),\nChristensen sees the norms in conflict, in Aisha\u2019s case, as one\nrequiring us to believe what our evidence entails, and another\nrequiring us to revise in light of higher-order evidence. (An\nalternative possibility, which Christensen suggests in earlier work\n[see his 2013], is that the second norm is explicitly an anti-akratic\nnorm.)\n\nAn important feature of Christensen\u2019s view is that, although\nAisha is subject to conflicting requirements, there is still a\nbest epistemic response in her situation. (Christensen holds\nthat the best response is to reduce confidence.) This raises a\nquestion: what determines which response is best? See Leonard 2020 for\narguments against the dilemma view; Leonard defends a nearby view\naccording to which there are conflicting norms, but it\u2019s\nindeterminate (among a restricted set of possibilities) what\nAisha should believe. Knoks (2021) defends a view along similar lines,\narguing that Aisha\u2019s situation is permissive (again, among a\nsimilarly-restricted set of possibilities). The possibility of\ndilemmas in epistemology raises several questions: how can epistemic\nrequirements relate (or not) to notions of epistemic blame, and how\ncan they guide our beliefs? See Hughes 2019 and 2021, e.g., for\nfurther discussion of these issues (though mostly focused on a\ndifferent putative source of conflicting requirements); Hughes defends\nthe position that we should accept epistemic dilemmas.\n4.2 Ideal vs. non-ideal modes of evaluation\n\nA few authors have suggested that while higher-order evidence has\ngenuine normative significance, this significance belongs only to some\nnon-ideal normative realm. So while a rationally ideal\nagent\u2019s higher-order evidence would have no effect on her\nfirst-order beliefs, a non-ideal agent\u2019s evidence should have\nsuch an effect\u2014precisely because she is non-ideal.\n\nJoshua DiPaolo (2019) develops one version of this view. Drawing on\nwork in political philosophy, he argues that we need an\nepistemological \u201ctheory of the second best\u201d. On his\nproposed view, the norms that apply to ideal agents are different from\nthe norms that apply to non-ideal agents. While the ideal norms define\na standard of perfection for all of us, non-ideal norms tell us how to\napproach that standard, taking our imperfections into account. DiPaolo\nargues that this approach allows us to resolve the apparent tensions\ninvolved in accommodating higher-order evidence: ideal rationality\nrequires ignoring higher-order evidence, but non-ideal rationality\nrequires respecting it.\n\nWhile non-ideal agents are limited in their reasoning abilities, they\nare also limited in their abilities to double-check and\n\u201cpolice\u201d themselves. Appealing to this consideration,\nJoshua Schechter (2013) makes a suggestion that cuts in the opposite\ndirection from DiPaolo\u2019s: he argues that perhaps our epistemic\nimperfections cap our responsibility to respond to higher-order\nevidence. This means that while our available evidence may call for\nextensive belief revision\u2014and while a more ideal agent\nwould revise her beliefs in response to higher-order\nevidence\u2014non-ideal believers like us are permitted to stop when\nwe\u2019ve done what we can.\n\nDeclan Smithies (2019) also defends a view on which the\nideal/non-ideal distinction comes into play. This is discussed in more\ndetail below.\n4.3 Best plans to follow vs. best plans to make\n\nAnother kind of two-norm view comes from Miriam Schoenfield (see her\n2015b and 2018). Schoenfield interprets judgments about rationality,\nin cases like Aisha\u2019s, as plans. She points out that we\ncan evaluate plans in (at least) two different ways: by looking at\nwhat will happen if they are followed perfectly, and by looking at\nwhat will happen if they are made. If you need to leave the house at\n10:30, but are habitually running late, \u201cleave the house at\n10\u201d might be the best plan to make, even if \u201cleave the\nhouse at 10:30\u201d is the best plan to follow. This is similar to\nDiPaolo\u2019s suggestion in that the difference between the best\nplan to make and the best plan to follow depends on a person\u2019s\n(predicted) rational shortcomings: the best plan to make is one that\ntakes these shortcomings into account in a particular way. However,\nSchoenfield\u2019s view is not that higher-order evidence\nonly has rational import for non-ideal agents; rather, it has the\nimport it has for anyone who rationally believes that they\nare non-ideal.\n\nAn advantage of this approach is that it allows us to focus on\naccuracy as the primary target of epistemic rationality. Schoenfield\nframes both modes of evaluation in terms of accuracy: specifically,\nthe accuracy-related consequences of the plan. So if she is\nright that the best-plan-to-make/best-plan-to-follow distinction can\nexplain higher-order evidence, we would end up with a relatively\nuniform two-norm view. See Horowitz 2019 for two objections: first,\nthat focusing on consequences seems to open the door to non-epistemic\nplans, such as \u201chave a sandwich before reasoning\u201d; second,\nthat the best plan to make might differ among different believers, in\nwhich case this strategy would not yield anything like a general\ndefense of revising in response to higher-order evidence. This second\nworry also raises questions about DiPaolo\u2019s proposal and how\nuniversal we can expect a non-ideal rationality to be.\n4.4 Reasons vs. rationality\n\nAlex Worsnip (2018) argues that we can explain the oddness of\nhigher-order evidence by distinguishing between two kinds of epistemic\nrequirements: evidence responsiveness and coherence.\nIf Aisha maintains her belief that G, and believes\nthat her evidence may well not support this belief, she will believe\neverything her evidence supports. If she revises her belief that she\nhas enough fuel (aligning it with her estimate of what the evidence\nsupports) she will be coherent. This view is one that explicitly\nappeals to epistemic akrasia, as Worsnip\u2019s coherence norms are\neffectively anti-akrasia norms.\n4.5 Evidence vs. dispositions\n\nMaria Lasonen-Aarnio (2020) argues that the conflict comes from two\ndifferent modes of evaluation which we can apply to Aisha\u2019s\ncase. In addition to evaluating whether believers have correctly\nfollowed the epistemic requirements that apply to them, or have\ncorrectly accommodated their evidence, we can also evaluate their\nbelief-forming dispositions. If Aisha holds onto her belief about\nG, while recognizing the danger of hypoxia in her own case,\nshe is responding appropriately to her evidence and is (if her belief\nis formed in the right way) following the requirements that apply to\nher. But she is also manifesting a disposition that is unlikely to\nserve her well in the long term: ignoring what appears to be\na conclusive reason for belief (her belief that she\u2019s likely to\nbe hypoxic, and therefore likely to be responding inappropriately to\nher evidence) will often involve actual conclusive reasons\nfor belief. We can criticize Aisha for manifesting this disposition,\neven if this particular case is not one of the situations in which it\ngoes wrong. (A relevant comparison here is Rule versus Act\nUtilitarianism: a good rule might occasionally lead to imperfect\noutcomes, whereas a good outcome might occasionally be the result of a\nbad rule. See Coates [2012] for a similar suggestion about rules in\nthis context.)\n\nSmithies (2019) defends a similar view, discussed in more detail in\nthe next subsection.\n4.5 Propositional justification vs. doxastic justification\n\nFinally, Paul Silva (2017) and Declan Smithies (2019) each\nargue\u2014though in different ways\u2014that we can resolve the\nconflict by distinguishing between propositional and doxastic\njustification. (Also see Ye 2020 for objections to the move to\ndoxastic justification in this context.) Let us consider Silva\u2019s\nproposal first. An agent like Aisha, he argues, is\npropositionally justified in believing G, and in\nbelieving that her evidence may well not support G. But she\ncannot come to rationally hold the belief that G: in\nother words, she cannot be doxastically justified in\nbelieving G. Silva\u2019s argument for this claim is in part\nan inference to the best explanation: although Aisha\u2019s evidence\nsupports G, it seems irrational for Aisha to act on that\nbelief, suggesting that Aisha lacks knowledge of G. If\nAisha\u2019s belief is propositionally justified but not known, this\nin turn suggests that the belief is not doxastically justified. (See\nalso van Wietmarschen 2013 for a similar proposal in the case of peer\ndisagreement. Van Wietmarschen\u2019s argument does not appeal to\nknowledge; rather, he argues directly that an agent\u2019s belief is\nnot well-grounded, or doxastically justified, if her basis for holding\nit does not respond to her higher-order evidence.)\n\nSmithies (2019) invokes this distinction to a slightly different end.\nAs mentioned above, he argues that we can never be propositionally\njustified in believing falsehoods about what our evidence\nsupports\u2014so, Aisha is propositionally justified in believing\nG, and propositionally justified in believing that\nher evidence supports this. But assuming that Aisha is a normal,\nnon-ideal believer, her own doxastic dispositions won\u2019t be\nsensitive enough to the evidence to safely track her propositional\njustification. This means that she can\u2019t be doxastically\njustified in believing that her evidence supports G.\nInterestingly, Smithies argues that in this case a non-ideal agent\nlike Aisha should be epistemically akratic; the ideal,\nnon-akratic state isn\u2019t available to her, and an akratic state\nis, he argues, the best she can do.\n5. Conclusion\n\nWe began by noting that higher-order evidence gives rise to a puzzle.\nIt seems that \u201chigher-order evidence\u201d\u2014information\nabout our own irrationality or unreliability\u2014should prompt us to\nrevise our beliefs about the world, but if we do so, we must ignore\nevidence and reasoning that is directly relevant to the truth of those\nbeliefs. Much of the literature on higher-order evidence revolves\naround this puzzle: arguing that we should reject one side of the\npuzzle or the other, or finding ways to hold onto both.\n\nAs of this writing, two related questions emerge as central to the\ndebate going forward. First: is higher-order evidence significant\nbecause it gives us information about our own rationality? Or\nbecause it gives us information about our own reliability?\nAnd second: are there genuine norms prohibiting epistemic akrasia?\n(So, should our beliefs about what\u2019s rational line up\nwith our beliefs about the world?) Or does the appearance of these\nnorms merely arise because of nearby norms regarding\nreliability\u2014or, perhaps, because there are multiple, conflicting\nmodes of epistemic normativity? Untangling the puzzles surrounding\nhigher-order evidence will ultimately involve answering these\nquestions as well, as well as broader questions about the relationship\nbetween rationality and truth.",
