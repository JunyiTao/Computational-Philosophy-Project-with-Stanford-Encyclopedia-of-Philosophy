Contemporary Practical Transcendental Arguments\n\nKant ethical writings (1785, 1788) feature several widely and\nintensely discussed transcendental arguments (see the entry\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy).\n As in metaphysics and epistemology, in recent times anti-skeptical\ntranscendental arguments have also been developed in the practical\nsphere.\n\nOne of P. F. Strawson\u2019s most influential works is his essay on\nmoral responsibility, \u201cFreedom and Resentment\u201d (Strawson\n1962). The reasoning in this article has not traditionally been\ninterpreted as a transcendental argument, but recently Justin Coates\nhas made a strong case for such a reading (Coates 2016; cf. Pereboom\n2016). In Coates\u2019s account, the argument begins with the premise\nto which the moral responsibility skeptic would agree, that meaningful\nadult interpersonal relationships are possible for us. It continues by\npointing out that relationships of this sort require that the\nparticipants show each other good will and respect, and that they be\njustified in expecting this of one another. Expectations for good will\nand respect in turn require susceptibility to the reactive attitudes,\nsuch as moral resentment, indignation, and gratitude, and in\nparticular, justified expectations for good will and respect\npresuppose that the participants are apt recipients of these reactive\nattitudes. But to be an apt target of the reactive attitudes is just\nwhat it is to be a morally responsible agent. Consequently, that we\nare morally responsible agents is a necessary condition of the\npossibility for us of meaningful adult interpersonal\nrelationships.\n\nNote that not all the connections among the steps of the argument are\nplausibly instances of appeals to logical or even metaphysical\nnecessary conditions. True, some are: if being an apt target of the\nreactive attitudes is what it is to be a morally responsible agent,\nthe necessary connection invoked would be conceptual or metaphysical.\nBut if expectations for good will and respect do require\nsusceptibility to the reactive attitudes, this would be plausibly a\ncase of nomological necessitation, where the relevant laws are\npsychological. But given the sort of skepticism targeted, nomological\nnecessitation is not too weak a connection; it is not called into\nquestion by the arguments of the moral responsibility skeptic.\n\nCritics have in effect taken issue with a number of steps of this\nargument, for example that expectations for good will and respect\nrequire susceptibility to the reactive attitudes, and that justified\nexpectations for good will and respect presuppose that the\nparticipants are apt recipients of the reactive attitudes. Perhaps\nhuman relationships do not require susceptibility to moral resentment\nand indignation, but only to the nonreactive attitudes of moral\nprotest, disappointment, and sorrow (Pereboom 2022). Another avenue of\ncriticism involves separating moral responsibility from being an apt\ntarget of the reactive attitudes. It may be that a forward-looking,\nthat is, what Strawson calls an \u2018optimistic\u2019 notion of\nresponsibility, is all that\u2019s required for good relationships,\nand it is not characterized by being an apt target of the reactive\nattitudes. But these criticisms are controversial, and\nStrawson\u2019s argument is widely accepted and acclaimed.\n\nAnother prominent transcendental argument in the practical sphere is\nthe sort Christine Korsgaard (1996) develops for Kantian claim that we\nmust value ourselves as rational agents. Here is Robert Stern\u2019s\n(2017) representation of one argument of this sort. The initial\npremise concerns rational choice, and crucially features the notion of\nan agent\u2019s practical identity, the distinctive nature of a\nperson as an agent, which may include, for example, being a parent or\na philosophy professor:\n\nTo rationally choose to do X, you must take it that doing X is the\nrational thing to do.\nSince there is no reason in itself to do X, you can take it that X\nis the rational thing to do only if you regard your practical identity\nas making X the rational thing to do.\nYou cannot regard your practical identity as making doing X the\nrational thing to do unless you can see some value in that practical\nidentity.\nYou cannot see any value in any particular practical identity as\nsuch, but can regard it as valuable only because of the contribution\nit makes to giving you reasons and values by which to live.\nYou cannot see having a practical identity as valuable in this way\nunless you think your having a life containing reasons and values is\nimportant.\nYou cannot regard it as important that your life contain reasons\nand values unless you regard your leading a rationally structured life\nas valuable.\nYou cannot regard your leading a rationally structured life as\nvaluable unless you value yourself qua rational agent.\nTherefore, you must value yourself qua rational agent, if you are\nto make any rational choice.\n\n\nStern (2017) explains this argument as follows. To act is to do or\nchoose something for a reason. However, an agent has reasons to act\nonly because of her practical identity; she does not have reasons to\nact independently of that identity. But a practical identity can yield\nsuch a reason only if she regards that identity as valuable. Merely\nbeing a parent gives one no reason to care for one\u2019s children.\nRather, valuing one\u2019s parenthood has this force. At the same\ntime, an agent cannot regard a particular practical identity as\nvaluable in itself; Korsgaard argues that this sort of realism about\nvalue is implausible. The only remaining explanation is that she\nregards it as valuable because of the contribution it makes to\nproviding her with reasons and values by which to live. But then she\nmust believe that it matters that her life has the sort of rational\nstructure that having such identities provides. However, to see that\nas mattering, she must regard leading a rationally structured life as\nvaluable. Then, in conclusion, to regard leading such a life as\nvaluable, an agent must see her rational nature as valuable.\n",
