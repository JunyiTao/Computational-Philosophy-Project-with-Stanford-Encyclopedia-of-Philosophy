    "main_text": "The ends and means of corporate governance || Ends: shareholder primacy or stakeholder balance?\n3.1 Ends: shareholder primacy or stakeholder balance?\n\nThere are two main views about the proper ends of corporate\ngovernance. According to one view, firms should be managed in the best\ninterests of shareholders. It is typically assumed that managing firms\nin shareholders\u2019 best interests requires maximizing their wealth\n(cf. Hart & Zingales 2017; Robson 2019). This view is called\n\u201cshareholder primacy\u201d (Stout 2012) or\u2014in order to\ncontrast it more directly with its main rival (to be discussed below)\n\u201cshareholder theory\u201d. Shareholder primacy is the dominant\nview about the ends of corporate governance in business schools and in\nthe business world.\n\nA few writers argue for shareholder primacy on deontological grounds,\ni.e., by appealing to rights and duties. On this argument,\nshareholders own the firm, and hire managers to run it for them on the\ncondition that the firm is managed in their interests. Shareholder\nprimacy is thus based on a promise that managers make to shareholders\n(Friedman 1970; Hasnas 1998). In response, some argue that\nshareholders do not own the firm. They own stock, a type of corporate\nsecurity (Bainbridge 2008; Stout 2012); the firm itself may be unowned\n(Strudler 2017). Others argue that managers do not make, explicitly or\nimplicitly, any promises to shareholders to manage the firm in a\ncertain way (Boatright 1994). More writers argue for shareholder\nprimacy on consequentialist grounds. On this argument, managing firms\nin the interests of shareholders is more efficient than managing them\nin any other way (Hansmann & Kraakman 2001; Jensen 2002). In\nsupport of this, some argue that, if managers are not given a single\nobjective that is clear and measurable\u2014viz., maximizing\nshareholder value\u2014then they will have greater opportunity for\nself-dealing (Stout 2012). The consequentialist argument for\nshareholder primacy run into problems that afflict many versions of\nconsequentialism: in requiring all firms to aim at a certain\nobjective, it does not allow sufficient scope for personal choice\n(Hussain 2012). Most think that people should be able to pursue\nprojects, including economic projects, that matter to them, even if\nthose projects do not maximize shareholder value.\n\nThe second main view about the proper ends of corporate governance is\ngiven by stakeholder theory. This theory was first put forward by\nFreeman in the 1980s (Freeman 1984; Freeman & Reed 1983), and has\nbeen refined by Freeman and collaborators over the years (see, e.g.,\nFreeman 1994; Freeman et al. 2010; Freeman, Harrison, &\nZyglidopoulos 2018; Jones, Wicks, & Freeman 2002; Phillips,\nFreeman, & Wicks 2003). According to stakeholder theory\u2014or\nat least, early formulations of it\u2014instead of managing the firm\nin the best interests of shareholders only, managers should seek to\n\u201cbalance\u201d the interests of all stakeholders, where a\nstakeholder is anyone who has a \u201cstake\u201d, or interest\n(including a financial interest), in the firm. Blair and Stout\u2019s\n(1999) \u201cteam production\u201d theory of corporate governance\noffers similar guidance.\n\nTo be clear, in a firm in which shareholders\u2019 interests are\nprioritized, other stakeholders will benefit too. Employees will\nreceive wages, customers will receive goods and services, and so on.\nThe debate between shareholder and stakeholder theorists is about what\nto do with the residual revenues, i.e., what\u2019s left over after\nfirms meet their contractual obligations to employees, customers, and\nothers. Shareholder theorists think they should be used to maximize\nshareholder wealth. Stakeholder theorists think they should be used to\nbenefit all stakeholders.\n\nTo its critics, stakeholder theory has seemed both incompletely\narticulated and weakly defended. With respect to articulation, one\nquestion that has been pressed is: Who are the stakeholders (Orts\n& Strudler 2002, 2009)? The groups most commonly identified are\nshareholders, employees, the community, suppliers, and customers. But\nother groups have stakes in the firm, including creditors, the\ngovernment, and competitors. It makes a great deal of difference where\nthe line is drawn, but stakeholder theorists have not provided a clear\nrationale for drawing it in one place rather than another. Another\nquestion is: What does it mean to \u201cbalance\u201d the interests\nof all stakeholders, other than not always giving precedence to\nshareholders\u2019 interests (Orts & Strudler 2009)? With respect\nto defense, critics have wondered what the rationale is for managing\nfirms in the interests of all stakeholders. In one place, Freeman\n(1984) offers an instrumental argument, claiming that balancing\nstakeholders\u2019 interests is better for the firm strategically\nthan maximizing shareholder wealth (see also Blair & Stout 1999;\nFreeman, Harrison, & Zyglidopoulos 2018). (Defenders of\nshareholder primacy say the same thing about their view.) In another,\nhe gives an argument that appeals to Rawls\u2019s justice as fairness\n(Evan & Freeman 1988; cf. Child & Marcoux 1999).\n\nIn recent years, questions have been raised about whether stakeholder\ntheory is appropriately seen as a genuine competitor to shareholder\nprimacy, or is even appropriately called a \u201ctheory\u201d. In\none article, Freeman and collaborators say that stakeholder theory is\nsimply \u201cthe body of research \u2026 in which the idea of\n\u2018stakeholders\u2019 plays a crucial role\u201d (Jones et al.\n2002). In another, Freeman describes stakeholder theory as \u201ca\ngenre of stories about how we could live\u201d (1994: 413). It may\nbe, as Norman (2013) says, that stakeholder is now best regarded as\n\u201cmindset\u201d, i.e., a way of looking at the firm that\nemphasizes its embeddedness in a network of relationships. In this\ncase, there may be no dispute between shareholder and stakeholder\ntheorists.\n\nResolving the debate between shareholder and stakeholder theorists\n(assuming they are competitors) will not resolve all or even most of\nthe ethical questions in business. This is because it is a debate\nabout the ends of corporate governance. It cannot answer\nquestions about the moral constraints that must be observed\nin pursuit of those ends (Goodpaster 1991; Norman 2013), including\nduties of beneficence (Mejia 2020). Neither shareholder theory nor\nstakeholder theory is plausibly interpreted as the view that corporate\nmanagers should do whatever is possible to maximize\nshareholder wealth and balance all stakeholders\u2019 interests,\nrespectively. Rather, these views should be interpreted as views that\nmanagers should do whatever is consistent with the requirements of\nmorality to achieve these ends. A large part of business ethics\nis trying to determine what these requirements are.\n",
