    "main_text": "Cultural Politics || Ethnocentrism and Relativism\n3.2 Ethnocentrism and Relativism\n\nOne result of Rorty\u2019s naturalism is that he is an avowed\nethnocentrist. If vocabularies are tools, then they are tools with a\nparticular history, having been developed in and by particular\ncultures. In using the vocabulary one has inherited, one is\nparticipating in and contributing to the history of that vocabulary\nand so cannot help but take up a position within the particular\nculture that has created it. As he puts it,\n\n\n\u2026one consequence of antirepresentationalism is the recognition\nthat no description of how things are from a God\u2019s-eye point of\nview, no skyhook provided by some contemporary or yet-to-be-developed\nscience, is going to free us from the contingency of having been\nacculturated as we were. Our acculturation is what makes certain\noptions live, or momentous, or forced, while leaving others dead, or\ntrivial, or optional. (ORT, 13)\n\n\nThis view looks to many readers like a version of cultural relativism.\nGranted, Rorty does not say that what is true, what is good, and what\nis right is relative to some particular ethnos, and so in that sense\nhe is no relativist. But the worry about relativism \u2013 that it\nleaves us with no rational way to adjudicate conflict \u2013 seems to\napply equally to Rorty\u2019s ethnocentric view. Rorty\u2019s answer\nis to say that in one sense of \u201crational\u201d that is true,\nbut that in another sense it is not, and to recommend that we drop the\nformer (TP, 186\u2013201). Rorty\u2019s position is that we have no\nnotion of rational warrant that exceeds, or transcends, or grounds,\nthe norms that liberal intellectuals take to define thorough,\nopen-minded, reflective discussion. It is chimerical, Rorty holds, to\nthink that the force or attractiveness of these norms can be enhanced\nby argument that does not presuppose them. It is pointless, equally,\nto look for ways of convicting those who pay them no heed of\nirrationality. Persuasion across such fundamental differences is\nachieved, if at all, by concrete comparisons of particular\nalternatives, by elaborate description and redescription of the kinds\nof life to which different practices conduce. In his own work,\nRorty\u2019s offers such comparisons, descriptions, and\nredescriptions, with the goal of making liberalism the most attractive\nalternative.\n",
