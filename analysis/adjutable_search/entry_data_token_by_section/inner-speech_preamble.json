    "main_text": "\n\nInner speech is known as the \u201clittle voice in the head\u201d or\n\u201cthinking in words.\u201d It attracts philosophical attention\nin part because it is a phenomenon where several topics of perennial\ninterest intersect: language, consciousness, thought, imagery,\ncommunication, imagination, and self-knowledge all appear to connect\nin some way or other to the little voice in the head. Specific\nquestions about inner speech that have exercised philosophers include\nits similarities to, and differences from, outer speech; its\nrelationship to reasoning and conceptual thought; its broader\ncognitive roles\u2014especially within metacognition and\nself-knowledge; and the role it can play in explanations of auditory\nverbal hallucinations and \u201cthought insertion\u201d.\n\nA more formal characterization of inner speech (yet one that still\naims at theoretical neutrality) is to say that inner speech is a\nmental phenomenon that is both keyed to a natural language and often\navailable to introspection. To say that inner speech is\n\u201cavailable to introspection\u201d is to say that each person\nhas an introspective way of knowing about their own inner speech\nepisodes that others lack (Schwitzgebel 2010 [2019]); our access to\nour own inner speech is\u2014at least often\u2014comparable to our\naccess to others of our conscious mental episodes. To say that inner\nspeech is \u201ckeyed to\u201d a natural language is to say that it\neither occurs in a natural language (like words spoken aloud) or\nrepresents words of a natural language (like an audio recording of a\nspeech), or that it does both. In specifying that the language in\nquestion is a \u201cnatural\u201d language, we mean to include any\nlanguage one may acquire through learning\u2014such as English,\nJapanese, or American Sign Language\u2014and to exclude any innate\nmental languages that may exist (such as a Fodorian [1975]\nMentalese, or other innate \u201clanguage of\nthought\u201d). This characterization leaves open several questions\nof controversy including: (1) whether all inner speech is\navailable to introspection; (2) whether inner speech is literally a\nform of speech, a form of thought, or both, or neither; and (3)\nwhether inner speech occurs in a natural language, or represents items\nof a natural language, or both.\n\nInner speech is a subject of study in many distinct disciplines,\nincluding neuroscience, speech pathology, developmental psychology,\npsychiatry, computer science, and linguistics, as well as philosophy.\nFor this reason, there are a variety of distinct theoretical tools and\nconcepts one might use to describe its nature and cognitive roles,\nwith correspondingly distinct aims, methods, and literatures. We focus\nhere on the accounts contemporary philosophers have given of its\nnature and on the explanatory purposes to which inner speech is most\ncommonly put in philosophical work. Nevertheless, much of the\ncontemporary philosophical work on inner speech is itself\ninterdisciplinary in nature and aims to be consistent with, and\ninformed by, results in allied disciplines, including, especially,\nexperimental psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience. We discuss\nthose sources where relevant to the issues that have exercised\nphilosophers, while directing readers most interested in the empirical\nwork to other reviews, such as Alderson-Day & Fernyhough (2015),\nLangland-Hassan (2021), and Perrone-Bertolotti et al. (2014). For\nanother philosophically-oriented review, see Vicente &\nMart\u00ednez-Manrique (2011). Also, we focus on inner speech linked\nto the auditory modality, as opposed to inner speech that may occur in\na gestural or visual modality (as may be the case with gestural sign\nlanguages), because nearly all of the existing research on inner\nspeech concerns a phenomenon that is in some way linked to\naudition.\n\nFinally, the phenomenon of speaking to oneself audibly is\nusually referred to as \u201cprivate speech\u201d. Some parts of the\ndiscussion in this entry are easily transferable to private speech,\ne.g., the matter of whether we can perform speech acts in inner\nspeech. Others are not. For example, the question of whether inner\nspeech, as a mental phenomenon, is actually a kind of speech has no\ncounterpart in the context of private speech, as private speech is\nuncontroversially a kind of speech. It is typically easy to determine\nwhether a question about inner speech also applies to private speech,\nso we will not comment on this further.\n",
