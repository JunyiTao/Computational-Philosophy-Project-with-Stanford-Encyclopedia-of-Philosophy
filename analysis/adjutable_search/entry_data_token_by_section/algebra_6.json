    "main_text": "Abstract Algebra || Groups\n2.2 Groups\n\nWhen two elements \\(x, y\\) of a monoid satisfy \\(xy = 1\\) we say that\n\\(x\\) is the left inverse of \\(y\\) and \\(y\\) is the right inverse of\n\\(x\\). An element \\(y\\) that is both a left and right inverse of \\(x\\)\nis called simply an inverse of \\(x\\).\n\nA group is a monoid every element of which has an\ninverse. The cardinality of a group is traditionally referred to\nas its order. A group element \\(g\\) is said to be of order\n\\(n\\) when \\(n\\) is the least positive integer for which \\(g^n = 1\\).\n\n\nExamples\n\nThe monoid of integers under addition, because every integer \\(x\\)\nhas inverse \\(-x\\).\nThe set \\(\\{0, 1\\}\\) of bits (binary digits) under the operation\n\\(\\XOR\\), because each bit is its own inverse: \\(0 \\XOR 0 = 1 \\XOR 1 =\n0\\). This is just the case \\(n = 2\\) of the monoid\n\\(\\{0,1,2,\\ldots,n-1\\}\\) of integers mod(ulo) \\(n\\) under addition mod\n\\(n\\) (e.g. \\(3 + 4 = 2\\) (mod 5)). Here 0 is its own inverse and the\ninverse of \\(m\\) when nonzero is \\(n - m\\).\nThe monoid \\(S_X\\) of bijections or permutations \\(f: X\n\\rightarrow X\\) under composition, because every permutation has an\ninverse \\(f^{-1}\\). When \\(X\\) has \\(n\\) elements \\(S_n\\) is of order\n\\(n!\\). \\(S_n\\) is abelian if and only if \\(n \\le 2\\).\nThe monoid of rotations of the plane about a point under\ncomposition, because every rotation can be reversed. This group is\ncalled the circle group, denoted SO(2).\nThe monoid of rotations of three-dimensional space about a point\nunder composition, again because every rotation can be reversed. This\ngroup is denoted SO(3).\nThe monoid of symmetries (rotations and reflections) of the\nregular \\(n\\)-gon about its center that carry the \\(n\\)-gon into\nitself, again by reversibility. This group is called the dihedral\ngroup \\(D_n\\), and is of order \\(2n\\). Like \\(S_n, D_n\\) is\nabelian if and only if \\(n \\le 2\\); in particular \\(D_3 = S_3\\).\n\n\n\nA subgroup of a group \\(G\\) is a submonoid of \\(G\\) closed\nunder inverses. The monoids of natural numbers and of even integers\nare both submonoids of the monoid of integers under addition, but only\nthe latter submonoid is a subgroup, being closed under negation,\nunlike the natural numbers.\n\nAn abelian group is a group whose operation is commutative.\nThe group operation of an abelian group is conventionally referred to\nas addition rather than multiplication, and abelian groups are\nsometimes called additive groups.\n\nA cyclic group is a group \\(G\\) with an element \\(g\\) such\nthat every element of \\(G\\) is of the form \\(g^i\\) for some positive\ninteger \\(i\\). Cyclic groups are abelian because \\(g^{i}g^j = g^{i +\nj} = g^j g^{i}\\). The group of integers under addition, and the groups\nof integers mod \\(n\\) for any positive integer \\(n\\), all form cyclic\ngroups, with 1 as a generator in every case. All cyclic groups are\nisomorphic to one of these. There are always other generators when the\ngroup is of order 3 or more, for example \\(-1\\), and for groups of\nprime order every nonzero element is a generator.\n",
