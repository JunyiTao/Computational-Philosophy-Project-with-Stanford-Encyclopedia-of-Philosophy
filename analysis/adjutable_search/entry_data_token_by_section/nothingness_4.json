    "main_text": "The contingency dilemma\n5. The contingency dilemma\n\nEarth would not have existed had the matter which now constitutes our\nsolar system formed, as usual, two stars instead of one. If no\nconcrete thing is a necessary being, then no concrete thing can\nexplain the existence of concrete things.\n\nEven if God is not concrete, proof of His existence would raise hope\nof explaining the existence of concrete things. For instance, the\nGenesis creation story suggests that God made everything\nwithout relying on any antecedent ingredients. The story also suggests\nthat God had a reason to create. If this account could be corroborated\nwe would have an explanation of why there are some concrete\nthings.\n\nThis divine explanation threatens to over-explain the data. Given that\nGod is a necessary being and that the existence of God necessitates\nthe existence of Earth, then Earth would be a necessary being rather\nthan a contingent being.\n\nThe dilemma was generalized by William Rowe (1975). Consider all the\ncontingent truths. The conjunction of all these truths is itself a\ncontingent truth. On the one hand, this conjunction cannot be\nexplained by any contingent truth because the conjunction already\ncontains all contingent truths; the explanation would be circular. On\nthe other hand, this conjunction cannot be explained by a necessary\ntruth because a necessary truth can only imply other necessary truths.\nThis dilemma suggests that \u2018Why are there any contingent\nbeings?\u2019 is impossible to answer.\n\nRowe presupposes that an answer would have to be a deductive\nexplanation. If there are \u2018inferences to the best\nexplanation\u2019 or inductive explanations, then there might be a\nway through the horns of Rowe\u2019s dilemma.\n\nThere also remains hope that Rowe\u2019s dilemma can be bypassed by\nshowing that the empty world is not a genuine possibility. Then the\nretort to \u2018Why is there something rather than nothing?\u2019 is\n\u2018There is no alternative to there being something!\u2019.\n\n\u2018There might be nothing\u2019 is false when read epistemically.\n(Roughly, a proposition is epistemically possible if it is consistent\nwith everything that is known.) For we know that something\nactually exists and knowledge of actuality precludes all\nrival epistemic possibilities. But when read metaphysically,\n\u2018There might be nothing\u2019 seems true. So \u2018Why is\nthere something rather than nothing?\u2019 is, so far, a live\nquestion.\n\nThe question is not undermined by the a priori status of\nknowledge that something exists. (I know a priori that\nsomething exists because I know a priori that I exist and\nknow this entails \u2018Something exists\u2019.) Knowledge, even\na priori knowledge, that something is actually true is\ncompatible with ignorance as to how it could be true.\n\nResidual curiosity is possible even when the proposition is known to\nbe a necessary truth. A reductio ad absurdum proof that 1\n\u2212 1/3 + 1/5 \u2212 1/7 + \u2026 converges to \u03c0/4 might\npersuade one that there is no alternative without illuminating how it\ncould be true. For this brute style of proof does not explain how \u03c0\nwandered into the solution. (Reductio ad absurdum just shows\na contradiction would follow if the conclusion were not true.) This\nraises the possibility that even a logical demonstration of the\nmetaphysical necessity of \u2018Something exists\u2019 might still\nleave us asking why there is something rather than nothing (though\nthere would no longer be the wonder about the accidentality of there\nbeing something). This leads Andrew Brenner (2016) to deny that\n\u2018Why is there something rather than nothing?\u2019 is\nrestricted to contingent entities. Brenner argues the question is\nhighly ambiguous. At best there is only a family resemblance between\nthe questions under discussion. What appears to be disagreement is too\noften a verbal dispute.\n",
