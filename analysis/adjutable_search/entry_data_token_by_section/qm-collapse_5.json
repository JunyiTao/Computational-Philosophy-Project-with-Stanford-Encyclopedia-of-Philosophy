    "main_text": "The Continuous Spontaneous Localization Model (CSL)\n6. The Continuous Spontaneous Localization Model (CSL)\n\nThe model just presented (QMSL) has a serious drawback: it does not\nallow to deal with systems containing identical constituents, because\nit does not respect the symmetry or antisymmetry requirements for such\nparticles. A quite natural idea to overcome this difficulty is to\nrelate the hitting process not to the individual particles but to the\nparticle number density averaged over an appropriate volume. This can\nbe done by introducing a new phenomenological parameter in the theory\nwhich however can be eliminated by an appropriate limiting procedure\n(see below).\n\nAnother way to overcome this problem derives from injecting the\nphysically appropriate principles of the GRW model within the original\napproach of P. Pearle. This line of thought has led to what is known\nas the CSL (Continuous Spontaneous Localization) model (Pearle 1989;\nGhirardi, Pearle, and Rimini 1990) in which the discontinuous jumps\nwhich characterize QMSL are replaced by a continuous stochastic\nevolution in the Hilbert space (a sort of Brownian motion of the\nstatevector).\n\nThe basic working principles are CSL are similar to those of the GRW\nmodel, though the technical detail might different significantly. For\na review see (Bassi and Ghirardi 2003; Adler 2007, Bassi, Lochan, et\nal. 2013). At this regard, it is interesting to note (Ghirardi,\nPearle, & Rimini 1990) that for any CSL dynamics there is a hitting\ndynamics which, from a physical point of view, is \u2018as close to\nit as one wants\u2019. Instead of entering into the details of the\nCSL formalism, it is useful, for the discussion below, to analyze a\nsimplified version of it.\n\nWith the aim of understanding the physical implications of the CSL\nmodel, such as the rate of suppression of coherence, we make now some\nsimplifying assumptions. First, we assume that we are dealing with\nonly one kind of particles (e.g., the nucleons), secondly, we\ndisregard the standard Schr\u00f6dinger term in the evolution and,\nfinally, we divide the whole space in cells of volume \\(d^3\\). We\ndenote by \\(\\ket{n_1, n_2 ,\\ldots}\\) a Fock state in which there are\n\\(n_i\\) particles in cell \\(i\\), and we consider a superposition of\ntwo states \\(\\ket{n_1, n_2 , \\ldots}\\) and \\(\\ket{m_1, m_2 , \\ldots}\\)\nwhich differ in the occupation numbers of the various cells of the\nuniverse. With these assumptions it is quite easy to prove that the\nrate of suppression of the coherence between the two states (so that\nthe final state is one of the two and not their superposition) is\ngoverned by the quantity:  \n\n\\[\\tag{6}\n\\exp\\{-f [(n_1 - m_1)^2 + (n_2 - m_2)^2 +\\ldots]t\\},\n\\]\n\n\nall cells of the universe appearing in the sum within the square\nbrackets in the exponent. Apart from differences relating to the\nidentity of the constituents, the overall physics is quite similar to\nthat implied by QMSL. \n\nEquation 6 offers the opportunity of discussing the possibility of\nrelating the suppression of coherence to gravitational effects. In\nfact, with reference to this equation we notice that the worst case\nscenario (from the point of view of the time necessary to suppress\ncoherence) is that corresponding to the superposition of two states\nfor which the occupation numbers of the individual cells differ only\nby one unit. In this case the amplifying effect of taking the square\nof the differences disappears. Let us then ask the question: how many\nnucleons (at worst) should occupy different cells, in order for the\ngiven superposition to be dynamically suppressed within the time which\ncharacterizes human perceptual processes? Since such a time is of the\norder of \\(10^{-2}\\) sec and \\(f = 10^{-16}\\text{ sec}^{-1}\\),\nthe number of displaced nucleons must be of the order of \\(10^{18}\\),\nwhich corresponds, to a remarkable accuracy, to a Planck mass. This\nfigure seems to point in the same direction as Penrose\u2019s\nattempts to relate reduction mechanisms to quantum gravitational\neffects (Penrose 1989).\n",
