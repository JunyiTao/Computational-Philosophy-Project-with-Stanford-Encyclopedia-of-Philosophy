    "main_text": "Responding to Civil Disobedience || Accommodating Civil Disobedience\n5. Conclusion\n\nThere have been shifts in the paradigm forms and goals of civil\ndisobedience over the past century, from the suffragettes\u2019\nmilitant activism in pursuit of their basic rights of citizenship to\nthe youth climate movement\u2019s school walkouts and mass\ndemonstrations to demand governments take urgent action to combat the\nclimate crisis. Even so, civil disobedience remains an enduring,\nvibrant part of political activism and, increasingly, benefits from\ntransnational alliances.\n\nTheorists have long assumed that civil disobedience only begs\njustification in liberal, democratic societies \u2013 the best\nreal-world candidates for legitimate states. However, civil\ndisobedience also raises questions in undemocratic and illegitimate\ncontexts, regarding its overall role, strategic value, and tactical\nefficacy. For instance, disobedient protests in support of democracy\nin Hong Kong may not be presumptively impermissible given\nChina\u2019s authoritarian rule. Yet they still beg significant\nquestions concerning the proper contours of extra-institutional\ndissident politics and the justification of uncivil and forceful\ntactics in repressive contexts, including violence against police and\nthe destruction of pro-China shops and Chinese banks.\n\nFinally, whereas theorists have tended to think of civil disobedience\nas generally undertaken to achieve worthy public goals, liberal\ndemocratic states have recently witnessed much disobedience in pursuit\nof anti-democratic and illiberal goals, including conscientious\nrefusal to abide by antidiscrimination statutes and violations of, and\nprotests against, laws requiring the provision of reproductive\nservices and the public health measures enacted to slow the spread of\nthe coronavirus. We may need a different lens than liberal and\ndemocratic theorists have offered to evaluate the full range of\nconservative social movements, counter-movements, and reactionary\nmovements which resort to civil (and other forms of) disobedience.\n",
