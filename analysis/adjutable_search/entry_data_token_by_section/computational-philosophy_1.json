Anticipations in Leibniz\n\n\nThe only way to rectify our reasonings is to make them as tangible as\nthose of the Mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a\nglance, and when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say:\nLet us calculate, without further ado, to see who is right. \u2014Leibniz,\nThe Art of Discovery\u00a0(1685\u00a0[1951:\u00a051])\n\n\nFormalization of philosophical argument has a history as old as\n logic.[1]\n Logic is the historical source and foundation of contemporary\n computing.[2]\n Our topic here is more specific: the application of contemporary\ncomputing to a range of philosophical questions. But that too has a\nhistory, evident in Leibniz\u2019s vision of the power of\ncomputation.\n\nLeibniz is known for both the development of formal techniques in\nphilosophy and the design and production of actual computational\nmachinery. In 1642, the philosopher Blaise Pascal had invented the\nPascaline, designed to add with carry and subtract. Between 1673 and\n1720 Leibniz designed a series of calculating machines intended to\ninstantiate multiplication and division as well: the stepped reckoner,\nemploying what is still known as the Leibniz wheel (Martin 1925). The\nsole surviving Leibniz step reckoner was discovered in 1879 as workmen\nwere fixing a leaking roof at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. In\ncorrespondence, Leibniz alluded to a cryptographic encoder and decoder\nusing the same mechanical principles. On the basis of those\ndescriptions, Nicholas Rescher has produced a working conjectural\nreconstruction (Rescher 2012).\n\nBut Leibniz had visions for the power of computation far beyond mere\narithmetic and cryptography. Leibniz\u2019s 1666 Dissertatio De\nArte Combinatoria\ntrumpets the \u201cart of combinations\u201d as a method of\nproducing novel ideas and inventions as well as analyzing complex\nideas into simpler elements (Leibniz 1666 [1923]). Leibniz describes it as the \u201cmother\nof inventions\u201d that would lead to the \u201cdiscovery of all\nthings\u201d, with applications in logic, law, medicine, and physics.\nThe vision was of a set of formal methods applied within a perfect\nlanguage of pure concepts which would make possible the general\nmechanization of reason (Gray\n 2016).[3]\n\nThe specifics of Leibniz\u2019s combinatorial vision \ncan be traced back to the mystical mechanisms of Raymond Llull circa 1308, combinatorial mechanisms lampooned in\nJonathan Swift\u2019s Gulliver\u2019s Travels of 1726 as allowing one to \n\n\nwrite books in philosophy, poetry, politics, mathematics, and\ntheology, without the least assistance from genius or study. (Swift\n1726: 174, Lem 1964 [2013: 359])\n\n\n\nCombinatorial specifics aside, however, Leibniz\u2019s vision of an\napplication of computational methods to substantive questions remains.\nIt is the vision of computational physics, computational biology,\ncomputational social science, and\u2014in application to perennial\nquestions within philosophy\u2014of computational philosophy.\n",
