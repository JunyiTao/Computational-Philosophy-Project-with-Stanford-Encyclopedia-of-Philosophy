    "main_text": "Why Public Reason? || Community or Civic Friendship\n1.4 Community or Civic Friendship\n\nAn alternative, though largely neglected, basis for public reason\nappeals to the importance of a particular conception of political\ncommunity or civic friendship (Ebels-Duggan 2010; Leland 2019; Leland\nand van Wietmarschen, 2017; Lister 2013). On this account, the\npractice of public reason is a constitutive part of a valuable\nrelationship. This relationship might be characterized in several\nways. The relationship might have the same structure as other\ncommunitarian relationships. In the same way relationships between\nco-nationals might be intrinsically valuable, and constituted by\nparticular social practices (e.g. shared language and cultural\ntraditions), membership in a pluralistic political community might be\nvaluable, and constituted, in part, by a practice of public reasoning\namongst citizens with regard to political rules and institutions. Only\nwhen our political community is regulated by laws that can be\njustified to each of us, despite our diverse perspectives, do we stand\nin the appropriate sort of valuable communal relationship with our\nfellow citizens (Lister 2013, ch. 5). A related, but slightly\ndifferent view, appeals to a conception of reciprocity that obtains\nwhen people are willing to propose and abide by fair principles of\ncooperation acceptable to others, provided those others are likewise\nwilling (Rawls 1996, 49\u201350). Rawls suggests that one role for\nthis criterion of reciprocity \u2018as expressed in public\nreason\u2026is to specify the nature of the political relationship\nin a constitutional democratic regime as one of civic\nfriendship\u2019 (Rawls 1996, li. Also see Leland and van\nWietmarschen, 2017). Rawls has presented public reason as part of the\nidea of democracy itself, especially the relationship in a democratic\nsociety between free and equal citizens (Rawls 1996, 213; Rawls 1999b,\n573). On this view, \u201cthe idea of public reason specifies at the\ndeepest level the basic moral and political values that are to\ndetermine a constitutional democratic government\u2019s relationship\nto its citizens and their relation to one another. In short, it\nconcerns how the political relation [of free and equal citizens] is to\nbe understood\u201d (Rawls 1999b, 574). The value of this\nrelationship might thus provide at least part of the moral basis for\npublic reason.\n\nThis potential basis for public reason is currently one of the less\nwell-developed in the literature, and thus important features of the\nview require elaboration. For example, does this view presuppose a\nparticular and controversial conception of the good life? And why\nshould we believe that the value of civic friendship has enough weight\nto ground a very particular conception of the type of reasons that can\nbe appropriately deployed in political deliberation? A full evaluation\nof this alleged basis for public reason would need to consider these\nand other issues.\n",
