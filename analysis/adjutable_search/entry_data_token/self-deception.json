Paradoxes, Puzzles, and Problems of Self-Deception\n\n\u201cWhat is self-deception?\u201d sounds like a straightforward\nquestion, but the more philosophers have sought to answer it, the more\npuzzling it has become. Traditionally, self-deception has been modeled\non interpersonal deception, where A intentionally gets\nB to believe some proposition p, all the while\nknowing or believing truly that ~p. Such deception is\nintentional and requires the deceiver to know or believe that\n~p and the deceived to believe that p. One reason\nfor thinking self-deception is analogous to interpersonal deception of\nthis sort is that it helps us to distinguish self-deception from mere\nerror since the acquisition and maintenance of the false belief are\nintentional, not accidental. It also helps to explain why we think\nself-deceivers are responsible for and open to the evaluation of their\nself-deception. If self-deception is properly modeled on interpersonal\ndeception, self-deceivers intentionally get themselves to believe that\np, all the while knowing or believing truly that ~p.\nOn this traditional model, then, self-deceivers apparently must (1)\nhold contradictory beliefs\u2014the dual-belief requirement\u2014and\n(2) intentionally get themselves to hold a belief they know or believe\ntruly to be false.\n\nThe traditional model of self-deception, however, has been thought to\nraise two paradoxes: One concerns the self-deceiver\u2019s state of\nmind\u2014the so-called static paradox. How can a person\nsimultaneously hold contradictory beliefs? The other concerns the\nprocess or dynamics of self-deception\u2014the so-called\ndynamic or strategic paradox. How can a person\nintend to deceive herself without rendering her intentions\nineffective? (Mele 1987a; 2001)\n\nThe dual-belief requirement raises the static paradox since\nit seems to pose an impossible state of mind, namely, consciously and\nsimultaneously believing that p and ~p. As deceiver,\nshe believes that ~p, and, as deceived, she believes that\np. Accordingly, the self-deceiver consciously believes that\np and ~p. But if believing both a proposition and\nits negation in full awareness is an impossible state of mind,\nself-deception, as it has traditionally been understood, seems\nimpossible as well. Static paradoxes also arise regarding\nmotivation, intention, emotion, and the like insofar as self-deceivers\nseem to harbor psychological states of these kinds that seem deeply\nincompatible (Funkhouser 2019).\n\nThe requirement that the self-deceiver intentionally gets herself to\nhold a belief she knows to be false raises the dynamic or\nstrategic paradox since it seems to involve the self-deceiver\nin an impossible project, namely, both deploying and being duped by\nsome deceitful strategy. As deceiver, she must be aware that\nshe\u2019s deploying a deceitful strategy; but, as deceived, she must\nbe unaware of this strategy for it to be effective. And yet it\u2019s\ndifficult to see how the self-deceiver could fail to be aware of her\nintention to deceive. A strategy known to be deceitful seems bound to\nfail. How could I be taken in by your efforts to get me to believe\nsomething false if I know what you\u2019re up to? But if it\u2019s\nimpossible to be taken in by a strategy one knows is deceitful, then,\nagain, self-deception, as it has traditionally been understood, seems\nto be impossible as well.\n\nThese paradoxes have led a minority of philosophers to be skeptical\nthat self-deception is conceptually possible or even coherent (Paluch\n1967; Haight 1980; Kipp 1980). Borge (2003) contends that accounts of\nself-deception inevitably give up central elements of our\nfolk-psychological notions of \u201cself\u201d or\n\u201cdeception\u201d to avoid paradox, leaving us to wonder whether\nthis framework itself is what gets in the way of explaining the\nphenomenon. Such skepticism toward the concept may seem warranted,\ngiven the obvious paradoxes involved. Most philosophers, however, have\nsought some resolution to these paradoxes instead of giving up on the\nnotion itself, not only because empirical evidence suggests that\nself-deception is not only possible but pervasive (Sahdra and Thagard\n2003) but also because the concept does seem to pick out a distinct\nkind of motivated irrationality.\n\nPhilosophical accounts of self-deception roughly fall into two main\ngroups: those that maintain that the paradigmatic cases of\nself-deception are intentional and those that deny this. Call these\napproaches intentionalist and revisionist,\nrespectively. Intentionalists find the model of intentional\ninterpersonal deception apt since it helps to explain the selectivity\nof self-deception and the apparent responsibility of self-deceivers,\nas well as provide a clear way of distinguishing self-deception from\nother sorts of motivated belief, such as wishful thinking. To avoid\nparadox, these approaches introduce a variety of divisions that shield\nthe deceiving from the deceived mind. Revisionists are skeptical of\nthese divisions and the \u2018psychological exotica\u2019 (Mele\n2001) apparently needed to avoid the static and dynamic paradoxes.\nInstead, they argue that revision of the intention requirement, the\nbelief requirement, or both offers a simpler account of self-deception\nthat avoids the paradoxes raised by modeling it on intentional\ninterpersonal deception.\n2. Intentionalist Approaches\n\nThe chief problem facing intentional models of self-deception is the\ndynamic paradox, namely, that it seems impossible to form an intention\nto get oneself to believe what one currently disbelieves or believes\nis false. For one to carry out an intention to deceive oneself, one\nmust know what one is doing; to succeed, one must be ignorant of this\nsame fact. Intentionalists agree that self-deception is intentional\nor, at least, robustly purposive, but divide over whether it requires\nholding contradictory beliefs and, thus, over the specific content of\nthe alleged intention involved (see\n \u00a73.2 Revision of Belief).\n Insofar as even the bare intention to acquire the belief that\np for reasons having nothing to do with one\u2019s evidence\nfor p seems unlikely to succeed if directly known, most\nintentionalists introduce some sort of temporal or psychological\npartition to insulate self-deceivers from their deceptive stratagems.\nWhen self-deceivers are not consciously aware of what they truly\nbelieve or intend, it\u2019s easier to see how they can play the role\nof the deceiver and the deceived. By dividing the mind into parts,\ntemporally or psychologically, these approaches seek to show that\nself-deception does not involve paradox.\n2.1 Temporal Partitioning\n\nSome intentionalists argue that self-deception is a complex,\ntemporally extended process during which a self-deceiver can\nconsciously set out to deceive herself that p, knowing or\nbelieving that ~p, and along the way lose her belief that\n~p, either forgetting her original deceptive intention\nentirely or regarding it as having, albeit accidentally, brought about\nthe true belief she would have arrived at anyway (Sorensen 1985;\nBerm\u00fadez 2000). So, for instance, an official involved in some\nillegal behavior might destroy any records of this behavior and create\nevidence that would cover it up (diary entries, emails, and the like),\nknowing that she will likely forget having done these things over the\nnext few months. When her activities are investigated a year later,\nshe has forgotten her tampering efforts and, based upon her falsified\nevidence, comes to believe falsely that she was not involved in the\nillegal activities of which she is accused. Here, the self-deceiver\nneed never simultaneously hold contradictory beliefs even though she\nintends to bring it about that she believes that p, which she\nregards as false at the outset of the process of deceiving herself and\ntrue at its completion.\n\nThe self-deceiver need not even forget her original intention to\ndeceive. Take an atheist who sets out to get herself to believe in God\nbecause it seems the best bet if God turns out to exist. She might\nwell remember such an intention at the end of the process and deem\nthat by God\u2019s grace even this misguided path led her to the\ntruth. What enables the intention to succeed in such cases is the\noperation of what Johnston (1988) terms \u2018autonomous means\u2019\n(e.g., the normal degradation of memory, the tendency to believe what\none practices, etc.), not the continued awareness of the intention,\nhinting that the process may be subintentional (See\n \u00a73.1 Revision of Intention).\n\nWhile such temporal partitioning accounts appear to avoid the static\nand dynamic paradoxes, many, if not most, cases of self-deception\naren\u2019t of this temporally extended type. Regularly,\nself-deception seems to occur instantaneously (Jordan 2022), as when a\nphilosopher self-deceives that her article is high quality even while\nreading the substantive and accurate criticisms in the rejection\nletter from the prestigious peer-reviewed journal she submitted it to\n(example due to Mele 2001). Additionally, many of these temporally\nextended cases lack the distinctive opacity, indirection, and tension\nassociated with garden-variety cases of self-deception (Levy\n2004).\n2.2 Psychological Partitioning\n\nAnother strategy employed by intentionalists is the division of the\nself into psychological parts that play the role of the deceiver and\ndeceived, respectively. These strategies range from positing strong\ndivision in the self, where the deceiving part is a relatively\nautonomous subagency capable of belief, desire, and intention (Rorty\n1988), to more moderate division, where the deceiving part still\nconstitutes a separate center of agency (Pears 1984, 1986; 1991), to\nthe relatively modest division of Davidson (1982, 1986), where there\nneed only be a boundary between conflicting attitudes and\nintentions.\n\nSuch divisions are prompted in large part by the acceptance of the\ndual-belief requirement. It isn\u2019t simply that self-deceivers\nhold contradictory beliefs, which though strange, isn\u2019t\nimpossible since one can believe that p and believe that\n~p without believing that p & ~p. The\nproblem such theorists face stems from the appearance that the belief\nthat ~p motivates and thus forms a part of the intention to\nbring it about that one acquires and maintains the false belief that\np (Davidson 1986). So, for example, the Nazi official\u2019s\nrecognition that his actions implicate him in serious evil motivates\nhim to implement a strategy to deceive himself into believing he is\nnot so involved; he can\u2019t intend to bring it about that he holds\nsuch a false belief if he doesn\u2019t recognize it is false, and he\nwouldn\u2019t want to bring such a belief about if he didn\u2019t\nrecognize the evidence to the contrary. So long as this is the case,\nthe deceiving self, whether it constitutes a separate center of agency\nor something less robust, must be hidden from the conscious self being\ndeceived if the self-deceptive intention is to succeed.\n\nWhile these psychological partitioning approaches seem to resolve the\nstatic and dynamic puzzles, they do so by introducing a picture of the\nmind that raises puzzles of its own. On this point, there appears to\nbe consensus even among intentionalists that self-deception can and\nshould be accounted for without invoking speculative or stipulative\ndivisions not already used to explain non-self-deceptive behavior,\nwhat Talbott (1995) calls \u2018innocent\u2019 divisions. That said,\nrecent, if controversial, research (e.g., Bargh and Morsella 2008;\nHassin, Bargh, and Zimmerman 2009; Huang and Bargh 2014) seems to\nsupport the possibility of the sort of robust unconscious but flexible\ngoal pursuit that could explain the way self-deceivers are able to\npursue their deceptive goal while retaining the beliefs necessary for\nnavigating the shifting evidential terrain (see Funkhouser and Barrett\n2016, 2017 and Doody 2016 for skepticism about the applicability of\nthis research to self-deception). If this kind of research shows that\nno \u2018psychological exotica\u2019 are necessary to explain\nself-deception, there is less pressure to deflate the phenomenon in\nways that minimize the active, strategic role self-deceivers play in\nthe process.\n3. Revisionist Approaches\n\nA number of philosophers have moved away from modeling self-deception\ndirectly on intentional interpersonal deception, opting instead to\nrevise either the intention or the belief requirement traditional\nintentionalist models assume. Those revising the intention requirement\ntypically treat self-deception as a species of motivationally biased\nbelief, thus avoiding the problems involved with intentionally\ndeceiving oneself. Call these non-intentionalist and\ndeflationary approaches.\n\nThose revising the belief requirement do so in a variety of ways. Some\nposit other, non-doxastic or quasi-doxastic attitudes toward the\nproposition involved (\u2018misrepresentation\u2019 Jordan 2020,\n2022; \u2018hope,\u2019 \u2018suspicion,\u2019\n\u2018doubt,\u2019 \u2018anxiety\u2019 Archer 2013;\n\u2018besires\u2019 Egan 2009; \u2018pretense\u2019 Gendler 2007;\n\u2018imagination\u2019 Lazar 1999). Others alter the content of the\nproposition believed (Holton 2001; Funkhouser 2005; Fern\u00e1ndez\n2013), while others suggest the doxastic attitudes involved are\nindeterminate, somehow \u2018in-between believing\u2019\n(Schwitzgebel 2001; Funkhouser 2009) or subject to shifting degrees of\ncredulity throughout the process of self-deception (Chan and Rowbottom\n2019). Call these revision of belief approaches.\n\nDeflationary approaches focus primarily on the process of\nself-deception, while the revision of belief approaches focus on the\nproduct. A revision of either of these aspects, of course, has\nramifications for the other. For example, if self-deception\ndoesn\u2019t involve belief, but some other non-doxastic attitude\n(product), then one may well be able to intentionally enter that state\nwithout paradox (process). This section considers non-intentional and\ndeflationary approaches and the worries such approaches raise\n (\u00a73.1).\n It also considers revision of belief approaches\n (\u00a73.2).\n3.1 Revision of Intention: Non-Intentionalist and Deflationary Approaches\n\nNon-intentionalists argue that most \u2018garden-variety\u2019 cases\nof self-deception can be explained without adverting to subagents, or\nunconscious beliefs and intentions, which, even if they resolve the\nstatic and dynamic puzzles of self-deception, raise puzzles of their\nown. If such non-exotic explanations are available, intentionalist\nexplanations seem unwarranted and unnecessary.\n\nSince the central paradoxes of self-deception arise from modeling\nself-deception on intentional interpersonal deception,\nnon-intentionalists suggest this model be jettisoned in favor of one\nthat takes \u2018to be deceived\u2019 to be nothing more than\nbelieving falsely or being mistaken in believing something (Johnston\n1988; Mele 2001). For instance, Sam mishears that it will be a sunny\nday and relays this misinformation to Joan with the result that she\nbelieves it will be a sunny day. Joan is deceived into believing it\nwill be sunny, and Sam has deceived her, albeit unintentionally.\nInitially, such a model may not appear promising for self-deception\nsince simply being mistaken about p or accidentally causing\noneself to be mistaken about p doesn\u2019t seem to be\nself-deception at all but some sort of innocent error.\nNon-intentionalists, however, argue that in cases of self-deception,\nthe false belief is not accidental but, rather, motivated by desire\n(Mele 2001), emotion (Lazar 1999), anxiety (Johnston 1988; Barnes\n1997), or some other attitude regarding p or related to\np. So, for instance, when Allison believes, against the\npreponderance of evidence available to her, that her daughter is not\nhaving learning difficulties, non-intentionalists will explain the\nvarious ways she misreads the evidence by pointing to such things as\nher desire that her daughter not have learning difficulties, her fear\nthat she has such difficulties, or anxiety over this possibility. In\nsuch cases, Allison\u2019s self-deceptive belief that her daughter is\nnot having learning difficulties fulfills her desire, quells her fear,\nor reduces her anxiety, and it\u2019s this function\u2014not an\nintention\u2014that explains why her belief formation process is\nbiased. Allison\u2019s false belief is not an innocent mistake but a\nconsequence of her motivational states.\n\nNon-intentionalists divide over the dual-belief requirement. Some\naccept the requirement, seeing the persistent efforts to resist the\nconscious recognition of the unwelcome truth or to reduce the anxiety\ngenerated by this recognition as characteristic of self-deception\n(Bach 1981; Johnston 1988). So, in Allison\u2019s case, her belief\nthat her daughter is having learning difficulties, along with her\ndesire that this not be the case, motivates her to employ means to\navoid this thought and to believe the opposite.\n\nOthers, however, argue the needed motivation can as easily be supplied\nby uncertainty or ignorance whether p, or suspicion that\n~p (Mele 2001; Barnes 1997). Thus, Allison need not hold any\nopinion regarding her daughter\u2019s having learning difficulties\nfor her false belief to count as self-deception since it\u2019s her\nregarding evidence in a motivationally biased way in the face of\nevidence to the contrary, not her recognition of this evidence, that\nmakes her belief self-deceptive. Accordingly, Allison needn\u2019t\nintend to deceive herself nor believe at any point that her daughter,\nin fact, has learning difficulties. If we think someone like Allison\nis self-deceived, then self-deception requires neither contradictory\nbeliefs nor intentions regarding the acquisition or retention of the\nself-deceptive belief. Such approaches are \u2018deflationary\u2019\nin the sense that they take self-deception to be explicable without\nreaching for exotic cognitive architecture since neither intentions\nnor dual-beliefs are required to account for self-deception. (For more\non the dual-belief requirement, see\n \u00a73.2 Revision of Belief.)\n\nMele (2001, 2012) has offered the most fully articulated deflationary\naccount, and his view has been the target of the most scrutiny, so it\nis worth stating what he takes to be the jointly sufficient conditions\nfor entering self-deception:\n\nThe belief that p, which S acquires, is\nfalse\nS treats data relevant, or at least seemingly relevant,\nto the truth value of p in a motivationally biased way\nThis biased treatment is a nondeviant cause of S\u2019s\nacquiring the belief that p\nThe body of data possessed by S at the time provides\ngreater warrant for ~p than for p\nS consciously believes at the time that there is a\nsignificant chance that ~p\nS\u2019s acquiring the belief that p is a\nproduct of \u201creflective, critical reasoning,\u201d and\nS is wrong in regarding that reasoning as properly\ndirected\n\n\nMele (2012) added the last two conditions to clarify his account in\nview of some of the criticisms of this kind of approach addressed in\nthe next section.\n\nTo support non-intentionalism, some have looked to the purposive\nmechanisms of deception operating in non-human organisms as a model\n(Smith 2014), while others have focused on neurobiological mechanisms\ntriggered by affect to explain the peculiarly purposive responses to\nevidence involved in self-deception (Lauria et al. 2016).\nDeflationary Worries and Modifications\n\nCritics contend these deflationary accounts do not adequately\ndistinguish self-deception from other sorts of motivated believing\n(such as wishful thinking), nor can they explain the peculiar\nselectivity associated with self-deception, its characteristic\n\u2018tension,\u2019 the way it involves a failure of\nself-knowledge, or the agency of the self-deceiver.\n\nSelf-Deception and Wishful Thinking: What distinguishes\nwishful thinking from self-deception, according to intentionalists,\njust is that the latter is intentional while the former is not\n(Berm\u00fadez 2000). Specifically, wishful thinking does not seem\n\u2018deceptive\u2019 in the requisite sense. Non-intentionalists\nrespond that what distinguishes wishful thinking from self-deception\nis that self-deceivers recognize evidence against their self-deceptive\nbelief whereas wishful thinkers do not (Bach 1981; Johnston 1988) or\nthat they merely possess, without recognizing it, greater\ncounterevidence than wishful thinkers (Mele 2001). In either case,\nself-deceivers exert more agency than wishful thinkers over their\nbelief formation. In wishful thinking, motivation triggers a belief\nformation process in which the person does not play an active,\nconscious role, \u201cwhile in self-deception the subject is a\nwilling participant in directing cognition towards the doxastic\nembrace of the favored proposition\u201d (Scott-Kakures 2002; see\nalso Szabados 1973). While the precise relationship between wishful\nthinking and self-deception is clearly a matter of debate,\nnon-intentionalists offer plausible ways of distinguishing the two\nthat do not invoke the intention to deceive.\n\nSelf-Deception and Selectivity: Another worry\u2014termed\nthe \u2018selectivity problem\u2019\u2014originally raised by\nBerm\u00fadez (1997, 2000) is that deflationary accounts don\u2019t\nseem to be able to explain the selective nature of self-deception\n(i.e., why motivation seems only selectively to produce bias). Why is\nit, such intentionalists ask, that we are not rendered biased in favor\nof the belief that p in many cases where we have a very\nstrong desire that p (or anxiety or some other motivation\nrelated to p)? Intentionalists argue that an intention to get\noneself to acquire the belief that p offers the most\nstraightforward answer to this question.\n\nOthers, following Mele (2001, 2012, 2020), contend that selectivity\nmay be explained in terms of the agent\u2019s assessment of the\nrelative costs of erroneously believing that p or ~p\n(see Friedrich (1993) and Trope and Lieberman (1996) on lay hypothesis\ntesting). Essentially, this approach suggests that the minimization of\ncostly errors is the central principle guiding hypothesis testing. So,\nfor example, Josh would be happier believing falsely that the gourmet\nchocolate he finds so delicious isn\u2019t produced by exploited\nfarmers than falsely believing that it is since he desires that it not\nbe so produced. Because Josh considers the cost of erroneously\nbelieving his favorite chocolate is tainted by exploitation to be very\nhigh\u2014no other chocolate gives him the same pleasure\u2014it\ntakes a great deal more evidence to convince him that his chocolate is\nso tainted than it does to convince him otherwise. It\u2019s the low\nsubjective cost of falsely believing the chocolate is not tainted that\nfacilitates Josh\u2019s self-deception. But we can imagine Josh\nhaving the same strong desire that his chocolate not be tainted by\nexploitation and yet having a different assessment of the cost of\nfalsely believing it\u2019s not tainted. Say, for example, he works\nfor an organization promoting fair trade and non-exploitive labor\npractices among chocolate producers and believes he has an obligation\nto accurately represent the labor practices of the producer of his\nfavorite chocolate and would, furthermore, lose credibility if the\nchocolate he himself consumes is tainted by exploitation. In these\ncircumstances, Josh is more sensitive to evidence that his favorite\nchocolate is tainted\u2014despite his desire that it not\nbe\u2014since the subjective cost of being wrong is higher for him\nthan it was before. It is the relative, subjective costs of falsely\nbelieving p and ~p that explain why desire or other\nmotivation biases belief in some circumstances and not others.\n\nWhile error-cost accounts offer some explanation of selectivity, one\nmight still complain that even when these conditions are met,\nself-deception needn\u2019t follow (Berm\u00fadez 2000, 2017). Some\nnon-intentionalist respond that these conditions are as complete an\nexplanation of self-deception as is possible. Given the complexity of\nthe factors affecting belief formation and the lack of a complete\naccount of its etiology, we shouldn\u2019t expect a complete\nexplanation in each case (Funkhouser 2019; Mele 2020). Others argue\nthat attention to the role of emotion in assessing and filtering\nevidence sheds further light on the process. According to such\napproaches, affect plays a key role in triggering the conditions under\nwhich motivation leads to self-deception (Galeotti 2016a; Lauria\net al. 2016; Lauria and Preissmann 2018). Our\nemotionally-loaded appraisal of evidence, in combination with\nevidential ambiguity and our potential to cope with the threatening\nreality, helps to explain why motivation tips us toward\nself-deception. Research on the role of dopamine regulation and\nnegative somatic markers provides some empirical support for this sort\nof affective model (Lauria et al. 2016; Lauria and Preissmann\n2018).\n\nNon-intentionalists also point out that intentionalists have\nselectivity problems of their own since it isn\u2019t clear why\nintentions are formed in some cases rather than others (Jurjako 2013)\nor why some intentions to acquire a self-deceptive belief succeed\nwhile others do not (Mele 2001, 2020) See Berm\u00fadez (2017) for a\nresponse to these worries.\n\nSelf-Deception and Tension: A number of philosophers have\ncomplained that deflationary accounts fail to explain certain\n\u2018tensions\u2019 or conflicts supposed to be present in cases of\ngenuine self-deception (Audi 1997; Bach 1997; Nelkin 2002; Funkhouser\n2005; Fern\u00e1ndez 2013; Jordan 2022). Take Ellen, who says she is\ndoing well in her biology class but systematically avoids looking at\nthe results on her quizzes and tests. She says she doesn\u2019t need\nto look; she knows she didn\u2019t miss anything. When her teacher\ntries to catch her after class to discuss her poor grades, she rushes\noff. Similarly, when she sees an email from her teacher with the\nsubject line \u201cyour class performance,\u201d she ignores it. The\nprospect of looking at the test results, talking with her teacher, or\nreading her email sends a flash of dread through her and a pit to her\nstomach, even as she projects calm and confidence. Ellen\u2019s\nbehavior and affective responses suggest to these critics that she\nknows she isn\u2019t doing well in her biology class, despite her\navowals to the contrary. Ellen\u2019s case highlights a variety of\ntensions that may arise in the self-deceived. Philosophers have\nfocused on tensions that arise with respect to evidence (since there\nis a mismatch between what the evidence warrants and what is believed\nor avowed); to unconscious doxastic attitudes (since they are at\nvariance with those consciously held); to self-knowledge (since one\nhas a false second-order belief about what one believes); to the\nvarious components of belief\u2014behavioral, verbal, emotional,\nphysical\u2014(since what one does, says, feels, or experiences can\ncome apart in a number of ways) (Funkhouser 2019); and to authorship\n(since one may be aware of authoring her self-deception and presenting\nher self-deception to herself as not having been authored, i.e., as\nthe truth) (Jordan 2022). These tensions seem to be rooted in the\nself-deceiver\u2019s awareness of the truth. But, since deflationary\naccounts deny the dual-belief requirement, specifically, that\nself-deceivers must hold the true belief that ~p, it\u2019s\nnot clear why self-deceivers would experience tension or display\nbehaviors in conflict with their self-deceptive belief p.\n\nDeflationary theorists counter that suspicion that ~p,\nthinking there\u2019s a significant possibility that ~p, may\nsuffice to explain these kinds of tensions (Mele 2001, 2009, 2010,\n2012). Clearly, a person who self-deceptively believes that p\nand suspects that ~p may experience tension; moreover, such\nattitudes combined with a desire that p might account for the\nbehaviors highlighted by critics.\n\nWhile these attitudes may explain some of the tension in\nself-deception, a number of critics think they are inadequate to\nexplain deep-conflict cases in which what self-deceivers say about\np is seriously at odds with non-verbal behavior that\njustifies the attribution of the belief that ~p to them\n(Audi, 1997; Patten 2003; Funkhouser 2005; Gendler 2007;\nFern\u00e1ndez 2013). While some propose these cases are just a\ntype of self-deception that deflationary approaches cannot\nexplain (Funkhouser 2009, 2019; Fern\u00e1ndez 2013), others go\nfurther, suggesting these cases show that deflationary approaches\naren\u2019t accounts of self-deception at all but of\nself-delusion since deflationary self-deceivers seem\nsingle-mindedly to hold the false belief (Audi 2007; Funkhouser 2005;\nGendler 2007).\n\nSome defenders of deflation acknowledge that the significant\ndifference between what deflationary accounts have in view (namely,\npeople who do not believe the unwelcome truth that ~p, having\na motivation-driven, unwarranted skepticism toward it) and what\ndeep-conflict theorists do (namely, people who know the unwelcome\ntruth that ~p and avoid reflecting on it or encountering\nevidence for it) warrants questioning whether these phenomena belong\nto the same psychological kind, but argue that it\u2019s the\ndeep-conflict cases that represent something other than\nself-deception. Those who unconsciously hold the warranted belief and\nmerely say or pretend they hold the unwarranted one (Audi 1997;\nGendler 2007) hardly seem deceived (Lynch 2012). They seem more to\nresemble what Longeway (1990) calls escapism, the avoidance\nof thinking about what we believe to escape reality (See Lynch\n2012).\n\nFunkhouser (2019) suggests that this dispute over the depth of\nconflict and intensity of tension involved in self-deception is, in\npart, a dispute over which cases are central, typical, and most\ninteresting. Whether deep-conflict cases constitute a distinct\npsychological kind or whether they reflect people\u2019s\npre-theoretical understanding of self-deception remains unclear, but\ndeflationary approaches seem to be capable of explaining at least some\nof the behavior such theorists insist justifies attributing an\nunconscious belief that ~p. Deep-conflict theorists need to\nexplain why we should think when one avows that p, one does\nnot also believe it to some degree, and why the behavior in question\ncannot be explained by nearby proxies like suspicion or doubt that\np (Mele 2010, 2012). Some deflationary theorists contend that\na degree of belief model might render deep-conflict cases more\nsensible (see Shifting Degrees of Belief).\n\nSelf-Deception and Self-Knowledge: Several theorists have\nargued that deflationary approaches miss certain failures of\nself-knowledge involved in cases of self-deception. Self-deceivers,\nthese critics argue, must hold false beliefs about their own belief\nformation process (Holton 2001; Scott-Kakures 2002), about what\nbeliefs they actually hold (Funkhouser 2005; Fern\u00e1ndez 2013),\nor both. Holton (2001), for instance, argues that Mele\u2019s\nconditions for being self-deceived are not sufficient because they do\nnot require self-deceivers to hold false beliefs about themselves. It\nseems possible for a person to acquire a false belief that p\nas a consequence of treating data relevant to p in a\nmotivationally biased way when the data available to her provides\ngreater warrant for p and still retain accurate\nself-knowledge. Such a person would readily admit to ignoring certain\ndata because it would undermine a belief she cherishes. She makes no\nmistakes about herself, her beliefs, or her belief formation process.\nSuch a person, Holton argues, would be willfully ignorant but\nnot self-deceived. If, however, her strategy was sufficiently opaque\nto her, she would be apt to deny she was ignoring relevant evidence\nand even affirm her belief was the result of what Scott-Kakures (2002)\ncalls \u201creflective, critical reasoning.\u201d These erroneous\nbeliefs represent a failure of self-knowledge that seems, according to\nthese critics, essential to self-deception, and they distinguish it\nfrom wishful thinking (see above), willful blindness, and other nearby\nphenomena.\n\nIn response to such criticisms, Mele (2009, 2012) has offered the\nfollowing sufficient condition: S\u2019s acquiring the\nbelief that p is a product of \u201creflective, critical\nreasoning,\u201d and S is wrong in regarding that reasoning as\nproperly directed. Some worry that meeting this condition requires a\ndegree of awareness about one\u2019s reasons for believing that would\nrule out those who do not engage in reflection on their reasons for\nbelief (Fern\u00e1ndez 2013) and fails to capture errors about what\none believes that seem essential for dealing with deep-conflict cases\n(Fern\u00e1ndez 2013; Funkhouser 2005). Whether Mele\u2019s (2009)\nproposed condition requires too much sophistication from\nself-deceivers is debatable but suggests a way of accounting for the\nintuition that self-deceivers fail to know themselves without\nrequiring them to harbor hidden beliefs or intentions.\n\nSelf-Deception and Agency: Some worry that deflationary\nexplanations render self-deceivers victims of their own motivations;\nthey don\u2019t seem to be agents with respect to their\nself-deception but unwitting patients. But, in denying self-deceivers\nengage in intentional activities for the purpose of deceiving\nthemselves, non-intentionalists needn\u2019t deny self-deceivers\nengage in any intentional actions. It\u2019s open to them to accept\nwhat Lynch terms agentism: \u201cSelf-deceivers end up with\ntheir unwarranted belief as a result of their own actions motivated by\nthe desire that p\u201d (Lynch 2017). According to agentism,\nmotivation affects belief by means of intentional actions, not simply\nby triggering biasing mechanisms. Self-deceivers can act with\nintentions like \u201cfind any problem with unwelcome evidence\u201d\nor \u201cfind any p-supporting evidence\u201d with a view\nof determining whether p is true. These kinds of intentions\nmay explain the agency of self-deceivers and how they could be\nresponsible for self-deception and not merely victims of their own\nmotivations. It isn\u2019t perfectly clear whether Mele-style\ndeflationists are committed to agentism, but even if they are,\nquestions remain about whether such unwittingly deceptive intentional\nactions are enough to render self-deceivers true agents of their\ndeception since they think that they are engaging in actions to\ndetermine the truth, not to deceive themselves.\n3.2 Revision of Belief: Adjustment of Attitude or Content\n\nApproaches that focus on revising the notion that self-deception\nrequires holding that p and ~p, the dual-belief\nrequirement implied by traditional intentionalism, either introduce\nsome \u201cdoxastic proxy\u201d (Baghramian and Nicholson 2013) to\nreplace one or both beliefs or alter the content of the\nself-deceiver\u2019s belief in a way that preserves tension without\ninvolving outright conflict. These approaches resolve the doxastic\nparadox either by denying that self-deceivers hold the unwelcome but\nwarranted belief ~p (Talbott 1995; Barnes 1997;\nBurm\u00fadez 2000; Mele 2001), denying they hold the welcome but\nunwarranted belief p (Audi 1982, 1988; Funkhouser 2005;\nGendler 2007; Fern\u00e1ndez 2013; Jordan 2020, 2022), denying they\nhold either belief p or ~p (Archer 2013; Porcher\n2012), or contending they have shifting degrees of belief regarding\np (Chan and Rowbottom 2019). Lauria et al. (2016)\nargue for an integrative approach that accommodates all these products\nof self-deception on the basis of empirical research on the role\naffect plays in assessments of evidence.\n\nDenying the Unwelcome Belief: Both intentionalists and\nnon-intentionalists may question whether self-deceivers must hold the\nunwelcome but warranted belief. For intentionalists, what\u2019s\nnecessary is some intention to form the target belief p, and\nthis is compatible with having no views at all regarding p\n(lacking any evidence for or against p) or believing p is merely\npossible (possessing evidence too weak to warrant belief that\np or ~p) (Berm\u00fadez 2000). Moreover, rejecting\nthis requirement relieves the pressure to introduce deep divisions\n(Talbott 1995). For non-intentionalists, the focus is on how the false\nbelief is acquired, not whether a person believes it\u2019s\ncontradictory. For them, it suffices that self-deceivers acquire the\nunwarranted false belief that p in a motivated way (Mele\n2001). The selectivity and tension typical of self-deception can be\nexplained without attributing ~p since nearby proxies like\nsuspicion that ~p can do the same work. Citing Rorty\u2019s\n(1988) case of Dr. Androvna, a cancer specialist who believes she does\nnot have cancer but who draws up a detailed will and writes\nuncharacteristically effusive letters suggesting her impending\ndeparture, Mele (2009) points out that Androvna\u2019s behavior might\neasily be explained by her holding that there\u2019s a significant\nchance I have cancer. And this belief is compatible with\nAndrovna\u2019s self-deceptive belief that she does not, in fact,\nhave cancer.\n\nDenying the Welcome Belief: Another strand of revision of\nbelief approaches focuses on the welcome belief that p,\nproposing alternatives to this belief that function in ways that\nexplain what self-deceivers typically say and do. Self-deceivers\ndisplay ambiguous behavior that not only falls short of what one would\nexpect from a person who believes that p but seems to justify\nthe attribution of the belief that ~p. For instance,\nAndrovna\u2019s letter-writing and will-preparation might be taken as\nreasons for attributing to her the belief that she won\u2019t\nrecover, despite her verbal assertions to the contrary. To explain the\nspecial pattern of behavior displayed by self-deceivers, some of these\ntheorists propose proxies for full belief, such as sincere avowal\n(Audi 1982, 1988); pretense (Gendler 2007); an intermediate state\nbetween belief and desire, or \u2018besire\u2019 (Egan 2009); some\nother less-than-full belief state akin to imaginations or fantasies\n(Lazar 1999); or simply \u2018misrepresentation\u2019 (Jordan 2020,\n2022). Such states may guide and motivate action in many, though not\nall, circumstances while being relatively less sensitive to evidence\nthan beliefs.\n\nOthers substitute a higher-order belief to explain the behavior of\nself-deceivers as another kind of proxy for the belief that p\n(Funkhouser 2005; Fern\u00e1ndez 2013). On such approaches,\nself-deceivers don\u2019t believe p; they believe that they\nbelieve that p, and this false second-order\nbelief\u2014\u201cI think that I believe that\np\u201d\u2014underlies and underwrites their sincere avowal\nthat p as well as their ability to entertain p as\ntrue. Self-deception, then, is a kind of failure of self-knowledge, a\nmisapprehension or misattribution of one\u2019s own beliefs. By\nshifting the content of the self-deceptive belief to the second-order,\nthis approach avoids the doxastic paradox and explains the\ncharacteristic \u2018tension\u2019 or \u2018conflict\u2019\nattributed to self-deceivers in terms of the disharmony between the\nfirst-order and second-order beliefs, the latter explaining their\navowed belief and the former their behavior that goes against that\navowed belief (Funkhouser 2005; Fern\u00e1ndez 2013).\n\nDenying both the Welcome Belief and the Unwelcome\nBelief: Given the variety of proxies that have been\noffered for both the welcome and the unwelcome belief, it should not\nbe surprising that some argue that self-deception can be explained\nwithout attributing either belief to self-deceivers, a position Archer\n(2013) refers to as \u2018nondoxasticism.\u2019 Porcher (2012)\nrecommends against attributing beliefs to self-deceivers on the\ngrounds that what they believe is indeterminate since they are, as\nSchwitzgebel (2001, 2010) contends,\n\u201cin-between-believing,\u201d neither fully believing that\np nor fully not believing that p. For Porcher\n(2012), self-deceivers show the limits of the folk psychological\nconcepts of belief and suggest the need to develop a dispositional\naccount of self-deception that focuses on the ways that\nself-deceivers\u2019 dispositions deviate from those of stereotypical\nfull belief. Funkhouser (2009) also points to the limits of folk\npsychological concepts and suggests that in cases involving deep\nconflict between behavior and avowal, \u201cthe self-deceived produce\na confused belief-like condition so that it is genuinely indeterminate\nwhat they believe regarding p.\u201d Archer (2013), however,\nrejects the claim that the belief is indeterminate or that folk\npsychological concepts are inadequate, arguing that folk psychology\noffers a wide variety of non-doxastic attitudes such as\n\u2018hope,\u2019 \u2018suspicion,\u2019 \u2018anxiety,\u2019\nand the like that are more than sufficient to explain paradigm cases\nof self-deception without adverting to belief.\n\nShifting Degrees of Belief: Some contend that\nattention to shifting degrees of belief offers a better explanation of\nparadigm cases of self-deception\u2014especially the behavioral\ntensions\u2014and avoids the static paradox (Chan and Rowbottom\n2019). In their view, many so-called non-doxastic attitudes entail\nsome degree of belief regarding p. Shifts in these beliefs\nare triggered by and track shifts in information and non-doxastic\npropositional attitudes such as desire, fear, anxiety, and anger. For\ninstance, a husband might initially have a high degree of belief in\nhis spouse\u2019s fidelity that plummets when he encounters\nthreatening evidence. His low confidence reveals afresh how much he\nwants her fidelity and prompts him to despair. These non-doxastic\nattitudes trigger another shift by focusing his attention on evidence\nof his spouse\u2019s love and fidelity, leaving him with a higher\ndegree of confidence than his available evidence warrants. On this\nshifting belief account, the self-deceiver holds both p and\n~p at varying levels of confidence that are always greater\nthan zero (example due to Chan and Rowbottom 2019).\n\nWhile revision of belief approaches suggest a number of\nnon-paradoxical ways of thinking about self-deception, some worry that\nthose approaches denying that self-deceivers hold the welcome but\nunwarranted belief that p eliminate what is central to the\nnotion of self-deception, namely, deception (see, e.g., Lynch\n2012; Mele 2010). Whatever the verdict, these revision of belief\napproaches suggest that our way of characterizing belief may not be\nfine-grained enough to account for the subtle attitudes or\nmeta-attitudes that self-deceivers bear on the proposition in\nquestion. Taken together, these approaches make it clear that the\nquestion regarding what self-deceivers believe is by no means\nresolved.\n4. Twisted or Negative Self-Deception\n\n\u2018Twisted\u2019 or negative self-deception differs from\n\u2018straight\u2019 or positive self-deception because it involves\nthe acquisition of an unwelcome as opposed to a\nwelcome belief (Mele 1999, 2001; Funkhouser 2019). Roughly,\nthe negatively self-deceived have a belief that is neither warranted\nnor wanted in consequence of some desire, emotion, or combination of\nboth. For instance, a jealous husband, uncertain about his\nwife\u2019s fidelity, comes to believe she\u2019s having an affair\non scant and ambiguous evidence, something he certainly doesn\u2019t\nwant to be the case. Intentionalists may see little problem here, at\nleast in terms of offering a unified account, since both positive and\nnegative self-deceivers intend to produce the belief in question, and\nnothing about intentional deception precludes getting the victim to\nbelieve something unpleasant or undesirable. That said,\nintentionalists typically see the intention to believe p as\nserving a desire to believe p (Davidson 1985; Talbott 1995;\nBerm\u00fadez 2000, 2017), so they still face the difficult task of\nexplaining why negative self-deceivers intend to acquire a belief they\ndon\u2019t want (Lazar 1999; Echano 2017). Non-intentionalists have a\nsteeper hill to climb since it\u2019s difficult to see how someone\nlike the anxious husband could be motivated to form a belief that he\ndoesn\u2019t at all desire. The challenge for the non-intentionalist,\nthen, is to supply a motivational story that explains the acquisition\nof such an unwelcome belief. Ideally, the aim is to provide a unified\nexplanation for both the positive and negative varieties with a view\nto theoretical simplicity. Attempts to provide such an explanation now\nconstitute a significant and growing body of literature that centers\non the nature of the motivations involved and the precise role affect\nplays in the process.\n\nSince the desire for the welcome belief cannot serve as the motive for\nacquiring the unwelcome one, non-intentionalists have sought some\nulterior motive (Pears 1984), such as the reduction of anxiety (Barnes\n1997), the avoidance of costly errors (Mele 1999, 2001), or denial\nthat the motivation is oriented toward the state of the world at all\n(Nelkin 2002).\n\nThe jealous husband might be motivated to believe his wife is\nunfaithful because it supports the vigilance needed to eliminate all\nrival lovers and preserve the relationship\u2014both of which he\ndesires (Pears 1984). Similarly, I might be anxious about my house\nburning down and come to hold the unwelcome belief that I\u2019ve\nleft the burner on. Ultimately, acquiring the unwelcome belief reduces\nmy anxiety because it prompts me to double-check the stove (Barnes\n1997). Some are skeptical that identifying such ulterior desires or\nanxieties is always possible or necessary (Lazar 1999; Mele 2001).\nMany, following Mele (2001, 2003), see a simpler explanation of\nnegative cases in terms of the way motivation, broadly speaking,\naffects the agent\u2019s assessment of the relative costs of error.\nThe jealous husband\u2014not wanting to be made a fool\u2014sees the\ncost of falsely believing his spouse is faithful as high, while the\nperson anxious about their house burning down sees the cost of falsely\nbelieving the burner is on as low. Factors such as what the agent\ncares about and what she can do about the situation affect these error\ncost assessments and may explain, in part, the conditions under which\nnegative self-deception occurs.\n\nSince negative self-deception often involves emotions\u2014fear,\nanxiety, jealousy, rage\u2014a good deal of attention has been given\nto how this component is connected to the motivation driving negative\nself-deception. Some, like Mele (2001, 2003), acknowledge the\npossibility that emotion alone or in combination with desire is\nfundamental to what motivates bias in these cases but remain reluctant\nto say such affective motives are essential or entirely\ndistinguishable from the desires involved. Others worry that leaving\nmotivation so ambiguous threatens the claim to provide a unified\nexplanation of self-deception (Galeotti 2016a). Consequently, some\nhave sought a more central role for affect, seeing emotion as\ntriggering or priming motivationally biased cognition (Scott-Kakures\n2000, 200; Echano 2017) or as operating as a kind of evidential filter\nin a pre-attentive\u2014non-epistemic\u2014appraisal of threatening\nevidence (Galeotti 2016a). On this latter affective-filter view, our\nemotions may lead us to see evidence regarding a situation we consider\nsignificant to our wellbeing as ambiguous and therefore potentially\ndistressing, especially when we deem our ability to deal with the\nunwelcome situation as limited. Depending on how strong our affective\nresponse to the distressing evidence is, we may end up discounting\nevidence for the situation we want, listening instead to our negative\nemotions (anxiety, fear, sorrow, etc.), with the result that we become\nnegatively self-deceived (see Lauria and Preissmann 2018). Research on\nthe role of dopamine regulation and negative somatic markers provides\nsome neurobiological evidence in support of this sort of\naffective-filter model and its potential to offer a unified account of\npositive and negative self-deception (Lauria et al. 2016; Lauria and\nPreissmann 2018).\n\nWhile the philosophers considered so far take the relevant motives to\nbe about the state of the world, some hold that the relevant motives\nhave to do with self-deceivers\u2019 states of mind. If this latter\ndesire-to-believe approach is taken, then there may be just one\ngeneral motive for both kinds of self-deception. Nelkin (2002, 2012),\nfor instance, argues that the motivation for self-deceptive belief\nformation should be restricted to a desire to believe that p\nand that this is compatible with not wanting p to be true. I\nmight want to hold the belief that I have left the stove\nburner on but not want it to be the case that I have actually left it\non. The belief is desirable in this instance because holding it\nensures it won\u2019t be true. What unifies cases of\nself-deception\u2014both twisted and straight\u2014is that the\nself-deceptive belief is motivated by a desire to believe that\np; what distinguishes them is that twisted self-deceivers do not\nwant p to be the case, while straight self-deceivers do.\nSome, like Mele (2009), argue that such an approach is unnecessarily\nrestrictive since a variety of other motives oriented toward the state\nof the world might lead one to acquire the unwelcome belief; for\nexample, even just wanting to not be wrong about the welcome belief\n(see Nelkin 2012 for a response). Others, like Galeotti (2016a), worry\nthat this desire-to-believe account renders self-deceivers\u2019\nepistemic confusion into something bordering on incoherence since it\nseems to imply self-deceivers want to believe p regardless of\nthe state of the world, and such a desire seems absurd even at an\nunconscious level.\n\nWhether the motive for self-deception aims at the state of the world\nor the state of the self-deceiver\u2019s mind, the role of affect in\nthe process remains a significant question that further research in\nneurobiology may shed light upon. The role of affect has been\nunderappreciated but seems to be gathering support and will no doubt\nguide future theorizing, especially on negative self-deception.\n5. Morality and Self-Deception\n\nEven though much of the contemporary philosophical discussion of\nself-deception has focused on epistemology, philosophical psychology,\nand philosophy of mind, historically, the morality of self-deception\nhas been the central focus of discussion. Self-deception has been\nthought to be morally wrong or, at least, morally dangerous insofar as\nit represents a threat to moral self-knowledge, a cover for immoral\nactivity, or a violation of authenticity. Some thinkers, what Martin\n(1986) calls \u2018the vital lie tradition,\u2019 however, have held\nthat self-deception can, in some instances, be salutary, protecting us\nfrom truths that would make life unlivable (e.g., Rorty 1972, 1994).\nThere are two major questions regarding the morality of\nself-deception: First, can a person be held morally responsible for\nself-deception, and if so, under what conditions? Second, is there\nanything morally problematic with self-deception, and if so, what and\nunder what circumstances? The answers to these questions are clearly\nintertwined. If self-deceivers cannot be held responsible for\nself-deception, then their responsibility for whatever morally\nobjectionable consequences self-deception might have will be mitigated\nif not eliminated. Nevertheless, self-deception might be morally\nsignificant even if one cannot be taxed for entering it. To be\nignorant of one\u2019s moral self, as Socrates saw, may represent a\ngreat obstacle to a life well lived, whether or not one is at fault\nfor such ignorance.\n5.1 Moral Responsibility for Self-Deception\n\nWhether self-deceivers can be held responsible for their\nself-deception is largely a question of whether they have the\nrequisite control over the acquisition and maintenance of their\nself-deceptive belief. In general, intentionalists hold that\nself-deceivers are responsible since they intend to acquire the\nself-deceptive belief, usually recognizing the evidence to the\ncontrary. Even when the intention is indirect, such as when one\nintentionally seeks evidence in favor of p or avoids\ncollecting or examining evidence to the contrary, self-deceivers seem\nto intentionally flout their own normal standards for gathering and\nevaluating evidence. So, minimally, they are responsible for such\nactions and omissions.\n\nInitially, non-intentionalist approaches may seem to remove the agent\nfrom responsibility by rendering the process by which she is\nself-deceived subintentional. If my anxiety, fear, or desire triggers\na process that ineluctably leads me to hold the self-deceptive belief,\nit seems I cannot be held responsible for holding that belief. How\ncould I be held responsible for processes that operate without my\nknowledge and which are set in motion without my intention? Most\nnon-intentionalist accounts, however, do allow for the possibility\nthat self-deceivers are responsible for individual episodes of\nself-deception or for the vices of cowardice and lack of self-control\nfrom which they spring. To be morally responsible in the sense of\nbeing an appropriate target for praise or blame requires, at least,\nthat agents have control over the actions in question. Mele (2001),\nfor example, argues that many sources of bias are controllable and\nthat self-deceivers can recognize and resist the influence of emotion\nand desire on their belief acquisition and retention, particularly in\nmatters they deem to be important\u2014morally or otherwise. The\nextent of this control, however, is an empirical question. Nelkin\n(2012) argues that since Mele\u2019s account leaves the content of\nmotivation driving the bias unrestricted, the mechanism in question is\nso complex that \u201cit seems unreasonable to expect the\nself-deceiver to guard against\u201d its operation.\n\nOther non-intentionalists take self-deceivers to be responsible for\ncertain epistemic vices, such as cowardice in the face of fear or\nanxiety and lack of self-control with respect to the biasing\ninfluences of desire and emotion. Thus, Barnes (1997) argues that\nself-deceivers \u201ccan, with effort, in some circumstances, resist\ntheir biases\u201d (83) and \u201ccan be criticized for failing to\ntake steps to prevent themselves from being biased; they can be\ncriticized for lacking courage in situations where having courage is\nneither superhumanly difficult nor costly\u201d (175). Whether\nself-deception is due to a character defect or not, ascriptions of\nresponsibility depend upon whether the self-deceiver has control over\nthe biasing effects of her desires and emotions.\n\nSome question whether self-deceivers do have such control. For\ninstance, Levy (2004) has argued that deflationary accounts of\nself-deception that deny the contradictory belief requirement should\nnot suppose that self-deceivers are typically responsible since it is\nrarely the case that self-deceivers possess the requisite awareness of\nthe biasing mechanisms operating to produce their self-deceptive\nbelief. Lacking such awareness, self-deceivers do not appear to know\nwhen or on which beliefs such mechanisms operate, rendering them\nunable to curb the effects of these mechanisms, even when they operate\nto form false beliefs about morally significant matters. Lacking the\ncontrol necessary for moral responsibility in individual episodes of\nself-deception, self-deceivers seem also to lack control over being\nthe sort of person disposed to self-deception.\n\nNon-intentionalists may respond by claiming that self-deceivers often\nare aware of the potentially biasing effects their desires and\nemotions might have and can exercise control over them (DeWeese-Boyd\n2007). They might also challenge the idea that self-deceivers must be\naware in the ways Levy suggests. One well-known account of control,\nemployed by Levy, holds that a person is responsible just in case she\nacts on a mechanism that is moderately responsive to reasons\n(including moral reasons), such that were she to possess such reasons,\nthis same mechanism would act upon those reasons in at least one\npossible world (Fischer and Ravizza 1999). Guidance control, in this\nsense, requires that the mechanism in question be capable of\nrecognizing and responding to moral and non-moral reasons sufficient\nfor acting otherwise. Nelkin (2011, 2012), however, argues that\nreasons-responsiveness should be seen as applying primarily to the\nagent, not the mechanism, requiring only that the agent has\nthe capacity to exercise reason in the situation under scrutiny. The\nquestion isn\u2019t whether the biasing mechanism itself is\nreasons-responsive but whether the agent governing its operation\nis\u2014that is, whether self-deceivers typically could recognize and\nrespond to moral and non-moral reasons to resist the influence of\ntheir desires and emotions and instead exercise special scrutiny of\nthe belief in question. According to Nelkin (2012), expecting\nself-deceivers to have such a capacity is more likely if we understand\nthe desire driving their bias as a desire to believe that\np, since awareness of this sort of desire would make it\neasier to guard against its influence on the process of determining\nwhether p. Van Loon (2018) points out that discussion of\nmoral responsibility and reasons-responsiveness have focused on\nactions and omissions that indirectly affect belief formation when it\nis more appropriate to focus on epistemic reasons-responsiveness.\nAttitudinal control, not action control, is what is at issue in\nself-deception. Drawing on McHugh\u2019s (2013, 2014, 2017) account\nof attitudinal control, Van Loon argues that self-deceivers on\nMele-style deflationary accounts are responsible for their\nself-deceptive beliefs because they recognize and react to evidence\nagainst their self-deceptive belief across a wide-range of\ncounter-factual scenarios even though their recognition of this\nevidence does not alter their belief and their reaction to such\nevidence leads them viciously to hold the self-deceptive belief.\n\nGaleotti (2016b) rejects the idea that control is the best way to\nthink about responsibility in cases of self-deception since\nself-deceivers on deflationary approaches seem both confused and\nrelatively powerless over the process. Instead, following a modified\nversion of Sher\u2019s (2009) account of responsibility, she contends\nthat self-deceivers typically have, but fail to recognize, evidence\nthat their acts related to belief formation are wrong or foolish and\nso fall below some applicable standard (epistemic, moral, etc.). The\nself-deceiver is under motivational pressure, not incapacitated, and\non exiting self-deception, recognizes \u201cthe faultiness of her\ncondition and feels regret and shame at having fooled herself\u201d\n(Galeotti 2016b). This ex-post reasons-responsiveness\nsuggests self-deceivers are responsible in Sher\u2019s sense even if\ntheir self-deception is not intentional.\n\nIn view of these various ways of cashing out responsibility,\nit\u2019s plausible that self-deceivers can be morally responsible\nfor their self-deception on deflationary approaches and certainly not\nobvious that they couldn\u2019t be.\n5.2 The Morality of Self-Deception\n\nInsofar as it seems plausible that, in some cases, self-deceivers are\napt targets for censure, what prompts this attitude? Take the case of\na mother who deceives herself into believing her husband is not\nabusing their daughter because she can\u2019t bear the thought that\nhe is a moral monster (Barnes 1997). Why do we blame her? Here we\nconfront the nexus between moral responsibility for self-deception and\nthe morality of self-deception. Understanding what obligations may be\ninvolved in cases of this sort will help to clarify the circumstances\nin which ascriptions of moral responsibility are appropriate. While\nsome instances of self-deception seem morally innocuous, and others\nmay even be thought salutary in various ways (Rorty 1994), most\ntheorists have thought there to be something morally objectionable\nabout self-deception or its consequences in many cases. Self-deception\nhas been considered objectionable because it facilitates harm to\nothers (Linehan 1982; Gibson 2020; Clifford 1877) and to oneself,\nundermines autonomy (Darwall 1988; Baron 1988), corrupts conscience\n(Butler 1726), violates authenticity (Sartre 1943), manifests a\nvicious lack of courage and self-control that undermines the capacity\nfor compassionate action (Jenni 2003), violates an epistemic duty to\nproperly ground self-ascriptions (Fern\u00e1ndez 2013), violates a\ngeneral duty to form beliefs that \u201cconform to the available\nevidence\u201d (Nelkin 2012), or violates a general duty to respect\nour own values (MacKenzie 2022).\n\nLinehan (1982) argues that we have an obligation to scrutinize the\nbeliefs that guide our actions that is proportionate to the harm to\nothers such actions might involve. When self-deceivers induce\nignorance of moral obligations in connection with the particular\ncircumstances, likely consequences of actions, or nature of their own\nengagements, by means of their self-deceptive beliefs, they may be\nculpable for negligence with respect to their obligation to know the\nnature, circumstances, likely consequences, and so forth of their\nactions (Jenni 2003; Nelkin 2012). Self-deception, accordingly,\nundermines or erodes agency by reducing our capacity for self-scrutiny\nand change (Baron 1988). If I am self-deceived about actions or\npractices that harm others or myself, my abilities to take\nresponsibility and change are also severely restricted.\n\nJoseph Butler (1726), in his well-known sermon \u201cOn\nSelf-Deceit,\u201d emphasizes the ways in which self-deception about\none\u2019s moral character and\nconduct\u2014\u2018self-ignorance\u2019 driven by inordinate\n\u2018self-love\u2019\u2014not only facilitates vicious actions but\nhinders the agent\u2019s ability to change. Such ignorance, claims\nButler, \u201cundermines the whole principle of good \u2026 and\ncorrupts conscience, which is the guide of life\u201d (1726). Holton\n(2022) explores the way our motivation to see ourselves as morally\ngood may play a role in this lack of moral self-knowledge.\nExistentialist philosophers such as Kierkegaard and Sartre, in very\ndifferent ways, view self-deception as a threat to\n\u2018authenticity\u2019 insofar as self-deceivers fail to take\nresponsibility for themselves and their engagements in the past,\npresent, and future. By alienating us from our own principles,\nself-deception may also threaten moral integrity (Jenni 2003).\nMacKenzie (2022) might be seen as capturing precisely what\u2019s\nwrong with this sort of inauthenticity when she contends that we have\na duty to properly respect our values, even non-moral ones. Since\nself-deception is always about something we value in some way, it\nrepresents a failure to properly respect ourselves as valuers. Others\nnote that self-deception also manifests a certain weakness of\ncharacter that disposes us to react to fear, anxiety, or the desire\nfor pleasure in ways that bias our belief acquisition and retention in\nways that serve these emotions and desires rather than accuracy\n(Butler 1726; Clifford 1877). Such epistemic cowardice (Barnes 1997;\nJenni 2003) and lack of self-control may inhibit the ability of\nself-deceivers to stand by or apply moral principles they hold by\nbiasing their beliefs regarding particular circumstances,\nconsequences, or engagements or by obscuring the principles\nthemselves. Gibson (2020), following Clifford (1877), contends that\nself-deception increases the risk of harm to the self and others and\nthe cultivation of epistemic vices like credulity that may have\ndevastating social ramifications. In all these ways and a myriad of\nothers, philosophers have found some self-deception objectionable in\nitself or for the consequences it has, not only on our ability to\nshape our lives but also for the potential harm it may cause to\nourselves and others.\n\nEvaluating self-deception and its consequences for ourselves and\nothers is a difficult task. It requires, among other things:\ndetermining the degree of control self-deceivers have; what the\nself-deception is about (Is it important morally or otherwise?); what\nends the self-deception serves (Does it serve mental health or as a\ncover for moral wrongdoing?); how entrenched it is (Is it episodic or\nhabitual?); and, whether it is escapable (What means of correction are\navailable to the self-deceiver?). As Nelkin (2012) contends,\ndetermining whether and to what degree self-deceivers are culpably\nnegligent will ultimately need to be determined on a case-by-case\nbasis in light of answers to such questions about the stakes at play\nand the difficulty involved. Others like Mackenzie (2022) hold that\nevery case of self-deception is a violation of a general duty to\nrespect our own values, though some cases are more egregious than\nothers.\n\nIf self-deception is morally objectionable for any of these reasons,\nwe ought to avoid it. But, one might reasonably ask how that\nis possible given the subterranean ways self-deception seems to\noperate. Answering this question is tricky since strategies will vary\nwith the analyses of self-deception and our responsibility for it.\nNevertheless, two broad approaches seem to apply to most accounts,\nnamely, the cultivation of one\u2019s epistemic virtues and the\ncultivation of one\u2019s epistemic community (Galeotti 2016b). One\nmight avoid the self-deceptive effects of motivation by cultivating\nvirtues like impartiality, vigilance, conscientiousness, and\nresistance to the influence of emotion, desire, and the like.\nAdditionally, one might cultivate an epistemic community that holds\none accountable and guides one away from self-deception (Rorty 1994;\nGaleotti 2016b, 2018). By binding ourselves to communities we have\nauthorized to referee our belief formation in this way, we protect\nourselves from potential lapses in epistemic virtue. These kinds of\nstrategies might indirectly affect our susceptibility to\nself-deception and offer some hope of avoiding it.\n6. Origin of Self-Deception: Adaptation or Spandrel\n\nQuite aside from the doxastic, strategic, and moral puzzles\nself-deception raises, there is the evolutionary puzzle of its origin.\nWhy do human beings have this capacity in the first place? Why would\nnatural selection allow a capacity to survive that undermines the\naccurate representation of reality, especially when inaccuracies about\nindividual ability or likely risk can lead to catastrophic errors?\n\nMany argue that self-deceptively inflated views of ourselves, our\nabilities, our prospects, or our control\u2014so-called\n\u2018positive illusions\u2019\u2014confer direct benefits in terms\nof psychological well-being, physical health, and social advancement\nthat serve fitness (Taylor and Brown 1994; Taylor 1989; McKay and\nDennett 2009). Just because \u2018positive illusions\u2019 make us\n\u2018feel good,\u2019 of course, it does not follow that they are\nadaptive. From an evolutionary perspective, whether an organism\n\u2018feels good\u2019 or is \u2018happy\u2019 is not significant\nunless it enhances survival and reproduction. McKay and Dennett (2009)\nargue that positive illusions are not only tolerable; evolutionarily\nspeaking, they contribute to fitness directly. Overly positive beliefs\nabout our abilities or chances for success appear to make us more apt\nto exceed our abilities and achieve success than more accurate beliefs\nwould (Taylor and Brown 1994; Bandura 1989). According to Johnston and\nFowler (2011), overconfidence is \u201cadvantageous, because it\nencourages individuals to claim resources they could not otherwise win\nif it came to a conflict (stronger but cautious rivals will sometime\nfail to make a claim, and it keeps them from walking away from\nconflicts they would surely win).\u201d Inflated attitudes regarding\nthe personal qualities and capacities of one\u2019s partners and\nchildren would also seem to enhance fitness by facilitating the\nthriving of offspring (McKay and Dennett 2009).\n\nAlternatively, some argue that self-deception evolved to facilitate\ninterpersonal deception by eliminating the cues and cognitive load\nthat consciously lying produces and by mitigating retaliation should\nthe deceit become evident (von Hippel and Trivers 2011; Trivers 2011,\n2000, 1991). On this view, the real gains associated with\n\u2018positive illusions\u2019 and other self-deceptions are\nbyproducts that serve this greater evolutionary end by enhancing\nself-deceivers\u2019 ability to deceive. Von Hippel and Trivers\n(2011) contend that \u201cby deceiving themselves about their own\npositive qualities and the negative qualities of others, people are\nable to display greater confidence than they might otherwise feel,\nthereby enabling them to advance socially and materially.\u201d\nCritics have pointed to data suggesting high self-deceivers are deemed\nless trustworthy than low self-deceivers (McKay and Dennett 2011).\nOthers have complained that there is little data to support this\nhypothesis (Dunning 2011; Van Leeuwen 2007a, 2013a), and what data\nthere is shows us to be poor lie-detectors (Funkhouser 2019; Vrij\n2011). Some challenge this theory by noting that a simple disregard\nfor the truth would serve as well as self-deception and have the\nadvantage of retaining true representations (McKay and Prelec 2011) or\nthat often self-deceivers are the only ones deceived (Van Leeuwen\n2007a; Kahlil 2011). Van Leeuwen (2013a) raises the concern that the\nwide variety of phenomena identified by this theory as self-deception\nrender the category so broad that it is difficult to tell whether it\nis a unified phenomenon traceable to particular mechanisms that could\nplausibly be sensitive to selection pressures. Funkhouser (2019)\nworries that the unconscious retention of the truth that von Hippel\nand Trivers (2011) propose would generate tells of its own and that\nthe psychological complexity of this explanation is unnecessary if the\ngoal is to deceive others (which is itself contentious) since that\ngoal would be easier to achieve through self-delusion. So, von Hippel\nand Trivers\u2019 (2011) theory may explain self-delusion but not\ncases of self-deception marked by deep conflict (Funkhouser\n2017b).\n\nIn view of these shortcomings, Van Leeuwen (2007a) argues the capacity\nfor self-deception is a spandrel\u2014a byproduct of other\naspects of our cognitive architecture\u2014not an adaptation in the\nstrong sense of being positively selected. While Funkhouser (2017b)\nagrees that the basic cognitive architecture that allows motivation to\ninfluence belief formation\u2014as well as the specific tools used to\nform or maintain biased belief\u2014were not selected for the sake of\nself-deception, it nevertheless makes sense to say, for at least some\ncontents, that self-deception is adaptive (2017b).\n\nWhether it is an adaptation or a spandrel, it\u2019s possible this\ncapacity has nevertheless been retained as a consequence of\nits fitness value. Lopez and Fuxjager (2011) argue that the broad\nresearch on the so-called \u201cwinner effect\u201d\u2014the\nincreased probability of achieving victory in social or physical\nconflicts following prior victories\u2014lends support to the idea\nthat self-deception is at least weakly adaptive since self-deception\nin the form of positive illusions, like past wins, confers a fitness\nadvantage. Lamba and Nityananda (2014) test the theory that\nself-deceived are better at deceiving others\u2014specifically,\nwhether overconfident individuals are overrated by others and\nunderconfident individuals underrated. In their study, students in\ntutorials were asked to predict their own performance on the next\nassignment as well as that of each of their peers in the tutorial in\nterms of absolute grade and relative rank. Comparing these predictions\nand the actual grades given on the assignment suggests a strong\npositive relationship between self-deception and deception. Those who\nself-deceptively rated themselves higher were rated higher by their\npeers as well. These findings lend suggestive support to the claim\nself-deception facilitates other deception. While these studies\ncertainly do not supply all the data necessary to support the theory\nthat the propensity to self-deception should be viewed as adaptation,\nthey do suggest ways to test these evolutionary hypotheses by focusing\non specific phenomena.\n\nWhether or not the psychological and social benefits identified by\nthese theories explain the evolutionary origins of the capacity for\nself-deceit, they may well shed light on its prevalence and\npersistence, as well as point to ways to identify contexts in which\nthis tendency presents high collective risk (Lamba and Nityananda\n2014).\n7. Collective Self-Deception\n\nCollective self-deception has received scant direct philosophical\nattention as compared with its individual counterpart. Collective\nself-deception might refer simply to a group of similarly\nself-deceived individuals or to a group-entity (such as a corporation,\ncommittee, jury, or the like) that is self-deceived. These\nalternatives reflect two basic perspectives that social\nepistemologists have taken on ascriptions of propositional attitudes\nto collectives. On the one hand, such attributions might be taken\nsummatively as simply an indirect way of attributing those\nstates to members of the collective (Quinton 1975/1976). This\nsummative understanding, then, considers attitudes attributed to\ngroups to be nothing more than metaphors expressing the sum of the\nattitudes held by their members. To say that students think tuition is\ntoo high is just a way of saying that most students think so. On the\nother hand, such attributions might be understood\nnon-summatively as applying to collective entities,\nthemselves ontologically distinct from the members upon which they\ndepend. These so-called \u2018plural subjects\u2019 (Gilbert 1989,\n1994, 2005) or \u2018social integrates\u2019 (Pettit 2003), while\nsupervening upon the individuals comprising them, may well express\nattitudes that diverge from individual members. For instance, saying\nNASA believed the O-rings on the space shuttle\u2019s booster rockets\nto be safe need not imply that most or all the members of this\norganization personally held this belief, only that the institution\nitself did. The non-summative understanding, then, considers\ncollectives to be, like persons, apt targets for attributions of\npropositional attitudes and potentially of moral and epistemic censure\nas well. Following this distinction, collective self-deception may be\nunderstood in either a summative or non-summative sense.\n\nIn the summative sense, collective self-deception refers to a\nself-deceptive belief shared by a group of individuals whom each come\nto hold the self-deceptive belief for similar reasons and by similar\nmeans, varying according to the account of self-deception followed. We\nmight call this self-deception across a collective. In the\nnon-summative sense, the subject of collective self-deception is the\ncollective itself, not simply the individuals comprising it. The\nfollowing sections offer an overview of these forms of collective\nself-deception, noting the significant challenges posed by each.\n7.1 Summative Collective Self-Deception: Self-Deception Across a Collective\n\nUnderstood summatively, we might define collective self-deception as\nthe holding of a false belief in the face of evidence to the contrary\nby a group of people as a result of shared desires, emotions, or\nintentions (depending upon the account of self-deception) favoring\nthat belief. Collective self-deception is distinct from other forms of\ncollective false belief\u2014such as might result from deception or\nlack of evidence\u2014insofar as the false belief issues from the\nagents\u2019 own self-deceptive mechanisms (however these are\nconstrued), not the absence of evidence to the contrary or presence of\nmisinformation. Accordingly, the individuals constituting the group\nwould not hold the false belief if their vision weren\u2019t\ndistorted by their attitudes (desire, anxiety, fear, or the like)\ntoward the belief. What distinguishes collective self-deception from\nsolitary self-deception is just its social context; namely, that it\noccurs within a group that shares both the attitudes bringing about\nthe false belief and the false belief itself.\n\nMerely sharing desires, emotions, or intentions favoring a belief with\na group does not entail that the self-deception is properly social\nsince these individuals may well self-deceive regardless of the fact\nthat their motivations are shared with others (Dings 2017; Funkhouser\n2019); they are just individually self-deceiving in parallel. What\nmakes collective self-deception social, according to\nDings (2017), is that others are a means used in each\nindividual\u2019s self-deception. So, when a person situates herself\nin a group of like-minded people in response to an encounter with new\nand threatening evidence, her self-deception becomes social.\nSelf-deception also becomes social in Dings\u2019 (2017) view when a\nperson influences others to make them like-minded with regard to her\npreferred belief, using their behavior to reinforce her\nself-deception. Within highly homogeneous social groups,\nhowever, it may be difficult to tell who is using the group\ninstrumentally in these ways, especially when that use is unwitting.\nMoreover, one may not need to seek out such a group of like-minded\npeople if they already comprise one\u2019s community. In this case,\nthose people may become instrumental to one\u2019s self-deception\nsimply by dint of being there to provide insulation from threatening\nevidence and support for one\u2019s preferred belief. In any case,\nthis sort of self-deception is both easier to foster and more\ndifficult to escape, being abetted by the self-deceptive efforts of\nothers within the group.\n\nVirtually all self-deception has a social component, being wittingly\nor unwittingly supported by one\u2019s associates (see Ruddick 1988).\nIn the case of collective self-deception, however, the social\ndimension comes to the fore since each member of the collective\nunwittingly helps to sustain the self-deceptive belief of the others\nin the group. For example, my cancer-stricken friend might\nself-deceptively believe her prognosis to be quite good. Faced with\nthe fearful prospect of death, she does not form accurate beliefs\nregarding the probability of her full recovery, attending only to\nevidence supporting full recovery and discounting or ignoring\naltogether the ample evidence to the contrary. Caring for her as I do,\nI share many of the anxieties, fears, and desires that sustain my\nfriend\u2019s self-deceptive belief, and as a consequence, I form the\nsame self-deceptive belief via the same mechanisms. In such a case, I\nunwittingly support my friend\u2019s self-deceptive belief, and she\nmine\u2014our self-deceptions are mutually reinforcing. We are\ncollectively or mutually self-deceived, albeit on a very small scale.\nRuddick (1988) calls this \u2018joint self-deception,\u2019 and it\nis properly social just in case each person is instrumental in the\nformation of the self-deceptive belief in the other (Dings 2017).\n\nOn a larger scale, sharing common attitudes, large segments of a\nsociety might deceive themselves together. For example, we share a\nnumber of self-deceptive beliefs regarding our consumption patterns.\nMany of the goods we consume are produced by people enduring labor\nconditions we do not find acceptable and in ways that we recognize are\nenvironmentally destructive and likely unsustainable. Despite our\nbeing at least generally aware of these social and environmental\nramifications of our consumptive practices, we hold the overly\noptimistic beliefs that the world will be fine, that its peril is\noverstated, that the suffering caused by the exploitive and\necologically degrading practices are overblown, that our own\nconsumption habits are unconnected to these sufferings, and even that\nour minimal efforts at conscientious consumption are an adequate\nremedy (see Goleman 1989). When self-deceptive beliefs such as these\nare held collectively, they become entrenched, and their consequences,\ngood or bad, are magnified (Surbey 2004).\n\nThe collective entrenches self-deceptive beliefs by providing positive\nreinforcement through others sharing the same false belief as well as\nby protecting its members from evidence that would destabilize the\ntarget belief. There are, however, limits to how entrenched such\nbeliefs can become and remain. Social support cannot be the sole or\nprimary cause of the self-deceptive belief, for then the belief would\nsimply be the result of unwitting interpersonal deception and not the\ndeviant belief formation process that characterizes self-deception. If\nthe environment becomes so epistemically contaminated as to make\ncounter-evidence inaccessible to the agent, then we have a case of\nsimple false belief, not self-deception. Thus, even within a\ncollective, a person is self-deceived just in case her own motivations\nskew the belief formation process that results in her holding the\nfalse belief. But, to bar this from being a simple case of solitary\nself-deception, others must be instrumental to her belief formation\nprocess such that if they were not part of that process, she would not\nbe self-deceived (Dings 2017). For instance, I might be motivated to\nbelieve that climate change is not a serious problem and form that\nfalse belief as a consequence. In such a case, I\u2019m not socially\nself-deceived, even if virtually everyone I know shares a similar\nmotivation and belief. But, say I encounter distressing evidence in my\nenvironmental science class that I can\u2019t shake on my own. I may\nseek to surround myself with like-minded people, thereby protecting\nmyself from further distressing evidence and providing myself with\nreassuring evidence. Now, my self-deception is social, and this social\ncomponent drives and reinforces my own motivations to\nself-deceive.\n\nRelative to solitary self-deception, the collective variety presents\ngreater external obstacles to avoiding or escaping self-deception and\nis, for this reason, more entrenched. If the various proposed\npsychological mechanisms of self-deception pose an internal challenge\nto the self-deceiver\u2019s power to control her belief formation,\nthen these social factors pose an external challenge to the\nself-deceiver\u2019s control. Determining how superable this\nchallenge is will affect our assessment of individual responsibility\nfor self-deception as well as the prospects of unassisted escape from\nit.\n7.2 Non-Summative Collective Self-Deception: Self-Deception of a Collective Entity\n\nCollective self-deception can also be understood from the perspective\nof the collective itself in a non-summative sense. Though there are\nvarying accounts of group belief, generally speaking, a group can be\nsaid to believe, desire, value, or the like just in case its members\n\u201cjointly commit\u201d to these things as a body (Gilbert 2005).\nA corporate board, for instance, might be jointly committed as a body\nto believe, value, and strive for whatever the CEO recommends. Such\ncommitment need not entail that each individual board member\npersonally endorses such beliefs, values, or goals, only that they do\nso as members of the board (Gilbert 2005). While philosophically\nprecise accounts of non-summative self-deception remain largely\nunarticulated\u2014an exception is Galeotti\u2019s (2018) detailed\nanalysis of how collective self-deception occurs in the context of\npolitics\u2014the possibilities mirror those of individual\nself-deception. When collectively held attitudes motivate a group to\nespouse a false belief despite the group\u2019s possession of\nevidence to the contrary, we can say that the group is collectively\nself-deceived in a non-summative sense.\n\nFor example, Robert Trivers (2000) suggests that \u2018organizational\nself-deception\u2019 led to NASA\u2019s failure to represent\naccurately the risks posed by the space shuttle\u2019s O-ring design,\na failure that eventually led to the Challenger disaster. The\norganization as a whole, he argues, had strong incentives to represent\nsuch risks as small. As a consequence, NASA\u2019s Safety Unit\nmishandled and misrepresented data it possessed that suggested that\nunder certain temperature conditions, the shuttle\u2019s O-rings were\nnot safe. NASA, as an organization, then, self-deceptively believed\nthe risks posed by O-ring damage were minimal. Within the institution,\nhowever, there were a number of individuals who did not share this\nbelief, but both they and the evidence supporting their belief were\ntreated in a biased manner by the decision-makers within the\norganization. As Trivers (2000) puts it, this information was\nrelegated \u201cto portions of \u2026 the organization that [were]\ninaccessible to consciousness (we can think of the people running NASA\nas the conscious part of the organization).\u201d In this case,\ncollectively held values created a climate within NASA that clouded\nits vision of the data and led to its endorsement of a fatally false\nbelief.\n\nCollective self-deceit may also play a significant role in\nfacilitating unethical practices by corporate entities. For example, a\ncollective commitment by members of a corporation to maximizing\nprofits might lead members to form false beliefs about the ethical\npropriety of the corporation\u2019s practices. Gilbert (2005)\nsuggests that such a commitment might lead executives and other\nmembers to \u201csimply lose sight of moral constraints and values\nthey previously held.\u201d Similarly, Tenbrunsel and Messick (2004)\nargue that self-deceptive mechanisms play a pervasive role in what\nthey call \u2018ethical fading,\u2019 acting as a kind of\n\u2018bleach\u2019 that renders organizations blind to the ethical\ndimensions of their decisions. They argue that such self-deceptive\nmechanisms must be recognized and actively resisted at the\norganizational level if unethical behavior is to be avoided. More\nspecifically, Gilbert (2005) contends that collectively accepting that\n\u201ccertain moral constraints must rein in the pursuit of corporate\nprofits\u201d might shift corporate culture in such a way that\nefforts to respect these constraints are recognized as part of being a\ngood corporate citizen. In view of the ramifications this sort of\ncollective self-deception has for the way we understand corporate\nmisconduct and responsibility, understanding its specific nature in\ngreater detail remains an important task.\n\nCollective self-deception, understood in either the summative or\nnon-summative sense, raises significant questions, such as whether\nindividuals within collectives bear responsibility for their\nself-deception or the part they play in the collective\u2019s\nself-deception and whether collective entities can be held responsible\nfor their epistemic failures (see Galeotti 2016b, 2018 on these\nquestions). Finally, collective self-deception prompts us to ask what\nmeans are available to collectives and their members to resist, avoid,\nand escape self-deception. Galeotti (2016b, 2018) argues for a variety\nof institutional constraints and precommitments to keep groups from\nfalling prey to self-deception.\n\nGiven the capacity of collective self-deception to entrench false\nbeliefs and to magnify their consequences\u2014sometimes with\ndisastrous results\u2014collective self-deception is not just a\nphilosophical puzzle; it is a problem that demands attention.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ames, R.T., and W.
