    "main_text": "\n\nThe medieval name for paradoxes like the famous Liar Paradox\n(\u201cThis proposition is false\u201d) was \u201cinsolubles\u201d\nor insolubilia,\n [1]\n though besides semantic paradoxes, they included epistemic paradoxes,\ne.g., \u201cYou do not know this proposition\u201d. From the\nlate-twelfth century to the end of the Middle Ages and beyond, such\nparadoxes were discussed at length by an enormous number of authors.\nYet, unlike twentieth century interest in the paradoxes, medieval\ninterest seems not to have been prompted by any sense of theoretical\n\u201ccrisis\u201d.\n\nThe history of the medieval discussions can be divided into three main\nperiods: (a) an early stage, from the late-twelfth century to the\n1320s; (b) a period of especially intense and original work, during\nroughly the second quarter of the fourteenth century; (c) a late\nperiod, from about 1350 on. The discussion in this article will be\norganized as follows:\n",
