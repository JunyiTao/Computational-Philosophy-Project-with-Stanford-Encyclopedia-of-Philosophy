    "main_text": "Virtues || The cardinal virtues\n4.4 The cardinal virtues\n\nAquinas accepts the Platonic-Aristotelian thesis that there are four\nvirtues which are cardinal, that is on which the moral life and all\nother virtues hinge or depend: prudentia, justice, courage,\nand temperantia. Each is a strategic element in one\u2019s\nintegrating of the good of practical reasonableness into one\u2019s\ndeliberations, choices and execution of choices (prudentia),\nin one\u2019s dealings with others justice), and in integrating and\ngoverning one\u2019s desires by genuine reasons\n(temperantia) and enabling one to face down intimidating\nobstacles (courage, fortitudo).\n4.4.1 Prudentia and love\n\nPractical reasonableness involves not only (i) an intelligent and\nrationally integrated understanding of practical reason\u2019s\nprinciples and of the implications that, under the auspices of the\nmaster principle of love of neighbor as self, they have in the form of\nmoral standards, but also (ii) the personal self-governance needed to\nput those conscientious judgments into effect by choices and\ncorresponding action. So prudentia has many phases or, as\nAquinas says, parts, and enters into every other virtue. It is far\nremoved from \u201cprudence\u201d in the sense of \u201crational\nself-interest\u201d, for by prudentia one is actively aware\nthat self-interest is self-stunting or indeed self-destructive unless\none transcends it by one\u2019s dispositions and acts of justice and\nfriendship or love. (And see 2.7 above.)\n\nAlthough Aquinas subscribes to Aristotle\u2019s thesis that practical\nreasonableness (phronesis, prudentia) concerns means\nrather than ends, he eliminates any quasi-Humeian reading of that\nthesis by emphasizing that what \u201cmoves\u201d prudentia\nis not one\u2019s passions but one\u2019s underivative understanding\nof the first practical principles and of the intelligible goods to\nwhich they point (synderesis movet prudentiam: ST\nII-II q. 47 a. 6 ad 3). Moreover, since he holds that virtually all\nmeans are also ends, the Aristotelian thesis in no way inhibits him\nfrom holding that prudentia is what guides one in identifying\nmoral standards and the \u201cmean\u201d of every virtue:\nprudentia \u201cdirects the moral virtues not only in\nchoosing means but also in establishing ends\u201d: I-II q. 66 a. 3\nad 3.\n4.4.2 Justice\n\nJustice is the steady and lasting willingness to give to others what\nthey are entitled to (their right: jus [or ius]\nsuum). Aquinas works with this Roman Law definition\n(ST II-II q. 58 a. 1c), and with Aristotle\u2019s division\nof justice into (i) distributive (good judgment about how to\ndivide up and parcel out beneficial or burdensome wholes or sets in a\nway that is fair because guided by appropriate criteria) and (ii) what\nAquinas calls commutative justice (good judgment going far\nwider than Aristotle\u2019s \u201ccorrective\u201d justice, and\nconcerned with all other kinds of dealings between persons). His\nprioritizing of the concept of right (jus), conceived as\nsomething that belongs to another, brings him to the brink of\narticulating a concept of human rights, a concept certainly implicit\nin his thesis that there are precepts of justice each imposing, on me\nand my communities, a duty to everyone without discrimination\n(indifferenter omnibus debitum: ST II-II q. 122 a.\n6). For his definition of justice immediately entails that correlative\nto such duties of justice there must be rights that belong to everyone\nindifferenter. Many duties of justice are positive\n(affirmative duties to give, do, etc.), and Aquinas treats the duties\nof relieving poverty both under justice and under love (of neighbor,\nfor God\u2019s sake). The duties in either case are essentially the\nsame, and Aquinas\u2019 understanding of them strongly affects his\nunderstanding of justified private property rights, which are valid\nbecause needed for prosperity and development, but are subject to a\nduty to distribute, directly or indirectly, one\u2019s\nsuperflua \u2013 that is, everything beyond what one needs\nto keep oneself and one\u2019s family in the state of life\nappropriate to one\u2019s (and their) vocation(s). For the natural\nresources of the world are \u201cby nature\u201d common; that is,\nreason\u2019s principles do not identify anyone as having a prior\nclaim to them other than under some customary or other socially\nposited scheme for division and appropriation of such resources, and\nsuch schemes could not be morally authoritative unless they\nacknowledged some such duty to distribute one\u2019s\nsuperflua.\n4.4.3 Fortitudo and temperantia\n\nThough one\u2019s passions, that is one\u2019s emotional desires and\naversions, support one\u2019s reason in deliberation, choice and\naction, they are also always capable of deflecting one from reasonable\nand right choice. So the ready disposition to keep these passions in\ntheir proper role is an essential element of a virtuous character and\nlife. By temperantia one integrates one\u2019s desires,\nparticularly but not only for sexual pleasure, with reason, lest\nreason be enslaved by passion and become its ingenious servant, as it\nreadily can. Temperantia is the mean, for example, between\nlust and frigidity or apathy (Aquinas everywhere rejecting any\n\u201cStoic\u201d ideal of passionlessness, and holding that there\nis good as well as bad concupiscentia).\n\nBy fortitudo one keeps one\u2019s aversions, particularly\nbut not only fear, in check lest one shirk one\u2019s moral\nresponsibilities in situations of danger or other adversity. It is the\nmean between recklessness or over-boldness and cowardice or\ndefeatism.\n",
