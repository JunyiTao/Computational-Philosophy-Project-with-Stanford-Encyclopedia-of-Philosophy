    "main_text": "Argumentation and Logic || Limitations of the Methods\n7.3 Limitations of the Methods\n\nDespite the Mohists\u2019 general optimism about the power of\ndisputation (bi\u00e0n \u8faf) to resolve scientific,\nethical, and political problems, an important aim of the \u201cLesser\nSelection\u201d is to warn against blindly relying on its formal\nmethods. Unlike a valid deductive argument, analogical\ndistinction-drawing is not invariably reliable. According to the\nMohists\u2019 characterization of the four techniques, a typical\npiece of disputation might involve giving an analogy to support an\nassertion; presenting pairs or series of syntactically parallel\nstatements and contending that since we accept some, we should accept\nothers; appealing to an opponent\u2019s precedent and challenging the\nopponent to explain how the case at hand is different; or asserting a\nstatement on grounds we take to be similar to those for one our\nopponent has already accepted. The Mohists see four sorts of problems\nthat may arise in drawing distinctions and thus making assertions on\nthese grounds, one for each of the four procedures. (1) Analogies are\nnot always reliable, because things similar in some respects may be\nimportantly different in others. (2) Formal parallels hold only up to\na point. (3) The grounds by which an opponent\u2019s precedent and\nour own assertion are \u201cso\u201d (correct) or not may be quite\ndifferent. (4) Likewise, an opponent\u2019s reasons for accepting\nsome assertion may be different from ours. The \u201cLesser\nSelection\u201d explains: \n\nThings have respects in which they are similar, yet it doesn\u2019t\nfollow that they are completely similar. Parallels between expressions\nare correct only up to a point. When things are \u201cso,\u201d\nthere is that by which they are \u201cso.\u201d Their being\n\u201cso\u201d is the same, but that by which they are\n\u201cso\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily the same. When people accept\nthings, there is that by which they accept them. Their accepting them\nis the same, but that by which they accept them isn\u2019t\nnecessarily the same. Hence expressions in analogies, paralleling,\n\u201cpulling,\u201d and \u201cpushing\u201d become different as\nthey proceed, become dangerous as they change direction, fail when\ntaken too far, and leave their roots as they flow, and so one cannot\nfail to be cautious and cannot invariably use them. Thus statements\nhave many methods, separate kinds have different reasons, and so one\ncannot look at only one side.\n\n\nWhether something is \u201cso\u201d (r\u00e1n\n\u7136)\u2014that is, whether some term is correctly predicable of\nit\u2014depends on \u201cthat which makes it so,\u201d in effect\nthe satisfaction conditions for the term. Things may be similar in\nsome respects without fulfilling the satisfaction conditions for the\nsame term. Linguistic expressions may be similar in structure while\nhaving dissimilar satisfaction conditions. Hence we must be cautious\nin using the techniques of disputation. Any guidance provided by\nsimilarities between things or parallels between expressions must\nalways be checked against our know-how concerning the\n\u201creasons\u201d (g\u00f9 \u6545, the grounds or\ncriteria) for using various expressions.\n\nThe Mohists appear to have been particularly concerned about\npotentially misleading formal parallels. We can illustrate their\nworries by considering a series of examples that contrast parallels\nthey accept with others they reject. Recall that they affirm the\nparallel utterances \u201cwhite horses are horses, riding white\nhorses is riding horses\u201d and \u201cblack horses are horses,\nriding black horses is riding horses.\u201d As they see it, this sort\nof parallel could provide analogical grounds for also affirming\n\u201cJane is a person, caring about Jane is caring about\npeople\u201d and presumably also \u201cneighbors are people, helping\nneighbors is helping people.\u201d This category of cases the Mohists\ncall \u201cthis and so,\u201d (sh\u00ec \u00e9r\nr\u00e1n \u662f\u800c\u7136) because the first part of\nthe utterance correctly states that something is \u201cthis\u201d\n(sh\u00ec \u662f) with respect to some kind name (as\nwhite or black horses are \u201cthis\u201d with respect to\n\u2018horse\u2019), while the second part correctly states that some\naction is \u201cso\u201d (r\u00e1n \u7136) with respect\nto some predicate (as riding white or black horses satisfies the\npredicate \u2018riding horses\u2019). Cases of the \u201cthis and\nso\u201d kind (l\u00e8i \u985e) can be offered as\nanalogical parallels to support other \u201cthis and so\u201d\nutterances on the grounds that they present the same kind of case.\n\n\nNow consider the utterance \u201ccarts are wood, riding carts is\nriding wood.\u201d Structurally, this is parallel to the examples\nabout horses. Yet the Mohists reject this utterance, presumably\nbecause they think the predicate \u201criding wood\u201d is a\nnonsense phrase that is never \u201cso,\u201d since nothing\nsatisfies it. The correct utterance to make in this case is\n\u201ccarts are wood, riding carts is not riding\nwood.\u201d Rather than \u201cthis and so,\u201d then, the cart\nexample is of the kind \u201cthis but not so\u201d (sh\u00ec\n\u00e9r b\u00f9 r\u00e1n \u662f\u800c\u4e0d\u7136).\nAs with \u201cthis and so,\u201d parallels between \u201cthis but\nnot so\u201d utterances can be drawn to support further \u201cthis\nbut not so\u201d utterances. For example, \u201ccarts are wood,\nriding carts isn\u2019t riding wood\u201d might be cited as a\nparallel to support \u201cboats are wood, getting in boats\nisn\u2019t getting in wood\u201d and \u201chouses are brick, living\nin houses isn\u2019t living in brick.\u201d Since paralleling\nreliably guides utterances only when used in cases of the same kind,\nhowever, dialecticians must carefully distinguish between cases\nproperly treated as \u201cthis and so\u201d and those properly\ntreated as \u201cthis but not so.\u201d Otherwise, they may draw\nfaulty parallels, such as thinking that, since helping neighbors is\nhelping people, living in houses is living in brick. \n\nThe underlying aim of the second half of the \u201cLesser\nSelection\u201d is to clear up such confusion and by so doing lay the\ngroundwork for defending Mohist positions. (Two positions mentioned\nspecifically are those on capital punishment for bandits and on the\nrejection of\n fatalism.)\n Toward this end, the text identifies five kinds of cases in which\n\u201cexpressions\u201d (c\u00ed \u8fad) are used\ndifferently. The first two are \u201cthis and so\u201d and\n\u201cthis but not so\u201d; the others are \u201cnot this but\nso,\u201d \u201cone universal and one not,\u201d and \u201cone\nthis and one not this.\u201d An effective way to illustrate the\nMohists\u2019 approach here is to consider their defense of capital\npunishment, which turns on the distinction between the first two kinds\nof cases. Mohist communities prohibited murder, punishing it by\n death.[34]\n They also apparently advocated capital punishment for, or at least\nlethal self-defense against, the roving gangs of robbers who\nterrorized small communities and traveling merchants. The\n\u201cLesser Selection\u201d implies that they were accused of\ninconsistency for these positions. Robbers are people, so killing\nrobbers is killing people. If killing people is wrong, isn\u2019t\nkilling robbers wrong? Moreover, Mohist ethics advocates caring\ninclusively about all people. Since robbers are people, caring about\nrobbers is caring about people. Killing them seems inconsistent with\ncaring about them. \n\nIn response, the \u201cLesser Selection\u201d contends that the\ncritics are mistaken to claim that killing robbers is killing people\nand caring about robbers is caring about people. In the Mohists\u2019\nview, these are in fact cases of the kind \u201cthis but not\nso\u201d: robbers are people, but killing robbers is not\nkilling people, and caring about robbers is not caring about\npeople. The \u201cLesser Selection\u201d employs paralleling\n(m\u00f3u \u4f94) to give the following explanation of\nthe Mohist stance: \n\n\nJill\u2019s parents are people; [but] Jill\u2019s serving her\nparents isn\u2019t serving people [it is not being employed as a\nservant].\n\nHer brother is a handsome man; [but] caring about her brother\nisn\u2019t caring about a handsome man [it is not sexual attraction].\n\nCarts are wood; [but] riding carts isn\u2019t riding wood.\n\nBoats are wood; [but] getting in boats isn\u2019t getting in wood.\n\nRobber-people are people; [but] there being many robbers isn\u2019t\nthere being many people;\n\nthere being no robbers isn\u2019t there being no people. \n\nHow do we clarify it?\n\nDetesting there being many robbers isn\u2019t detesting there being\nmany people;\n\ndesiring there be no robbers isn\u2019t desiring there be no people.\n\n\nAll the world accompany each other in together deeming these right\n(sh\u00ec \u662f). If it is like this, then although\nrobber-people are people,\n\ncaring about robbers isn\u2019t caring about people [it is not\npracticing inclusive care];\n\nnot caring about robbers isn\u2019t not caring about people [it is\nnot failing to practice inclusive care];\n\nkilling robber-people isn\u2019t killing people.\n\nThere\u2019s no difficulty in this. These cases and those previous\nones [the preceding, purportedly uncontroversial examples] are the\nsame kind. The world accepts those without condemning themselves; the\nMohists accept these but the world condemns them.\u2026These are\ncases of \u201cthis but not so.\u201d\n\n\nOn the grounds of parallelism with (supposedly) uncontroversial\nutterances that \u201call the world\u201d purportedly agree are\nright, we are expected to affirm that killing robbers is not killing\npeople and that not caring about robbers\u2014being unconcerned for\ntheir benefit\u2014is not failing to care about people. Since we\nacknowledge other, parallel \u201cthis but not so\u201d cases, the\ntext asserts, we should accept these as well. Just as lacking robbers\nisn\u2019t lacking people, working on behalf of one\u2019s parents\nisn\u2019t working as a servant, and riding carts isn\u2019t riding\nwood, executing robbers isn\u2019t murdering people and not caring\nabout them isn\u2019t failing to practice inclusive care. \n\nIn contemporary terms, of course, we could reconstruct the passage as\noffering a somewhat bizarre analogical argument for the conclusion\nthat \u201ckilling robber-people isn\u2019t killing people.\u201d\nThe Mohists themselves do not understand it that way, however. They do\nnot see the passage as presenting a series of premises for the\none-sentence conclusion \u201ckilling robber-people isn\u2019t\nkilling people.\u201d They see it as laying out a series of\nsyntactically parallel utterances to illustrate that utterances like\n\u201crobber-people are people, [but] killing robber-people\nisn\u2019t killing people\u201d and \u201crobber-people are people,\n[but] caring about robbers isn\u2019t caring about people\u201d fit\ninto an accepted pattern of statements describing a familiar kind of\nsituation in which, although x is y, Fx is\nnot deemed an act of the kind Fy. \n\nThe text gives no further, substantive explanation of this stance. The\nMohists simply declare that the robbers case is \u201cthis but not\nso,\u201d rather than \u201cthis and so,\u201d and thus despite the\nobvious formal similarity between \u201criding black horses is riding\nhorses\u201d and \u201ckilling robber-people is killing\npeople,\u201d drawing parallels (m\u00f3u \u4f94)\nbetween them is misleading. Previously, of course, the text explained\nthat expressions of different kinds rest on different grounds\n(g\u00f9 \u6545, reasons). On the Mohists\u2019 behalf,\nthen, we can conjecture that the grounds (g\u00f9) that\njustify applying the predicate \u2018killing robbers\u2019 diverge\nfrom those for \u2018killing people\u2019, such that when\n\u2018killing robbers\u2019 is \u201cso,\u201d \u2018killing\npeople\u2019 is \u201cnot so.\u201d Killing people is murder, the\nunjustified killing of innocents; killing robbers is the morally\njustified, legally sanctioned execution of guilty criminals. Similar\nconsiderations would apply to the predicates \u2018caring about\npeople\u2019 and \u2018caring about robbers\u2019. For example, to\nthe Mohists, caring about people entails concern for all\npeople\u2019s benefit; perhaps they hold that since robbers harm\nothers, caring about them is incompatible with concern for all\npeople\u2019s benefit.\n\nStill, what makes killing robbers a case of \u201cthis but not\nso\u201d rather than \u201cthis and so\u201d? Indeed, what is the\nbasis for the entire fivefold taxonomy of cases? The Mohists answer\nneither question\n explicitly.[35]\n Nor do they offer a principled or systematic diagnosis of the\nfailures of syntactic parallelism. They simply stipulate that killing\nrobbers belongs with the other examples under \u201cthis but not\nso.\u201d A critic might respond that the entire \u201cthis but not\nso\u201d group looks suspiciously ad hoc. Why isn\u2019t\nJill\u2019s caring about her good-looking brother an instance of\ncaring about a handsome man? Granted that sibling affection is\ndifferent from sexual attraction, it is still care, in this case\ndirected at a man who happens to be handsome. Similarly, granted that\nexecuting criminals is different from murder, it is still an event in\nwhich people are killed. The Mohists could probably have found a more\ncompelling way to do justice to the distinctions at stake than by\ninsisting on the apparently paradoxical claim\u2014later attacked by\nXunzi\u2014that although robbers are people, killing robbers\nisn\u2019t killing people. One promising alternative consistent with\ntheir program might have been to distinguish between different kinds\nof killing. They could have pointed out that \u2018killing\npeople\u2019 refers generally to all kinds of actions in which one\nperson causes another to die. These include a range of more specific\nkinds of actions, among them intentional, morally wrong killing of the\ninnocent (murder) and community-sanctioned, morally justified killing\nof criminals (execution). Thus killing robbers could be an action of\nthe kind killing people without being of the kind morally\nwrong killing. \n\nThis is roughly the approach that\n Xunzi\n adopts in handling a related issue. He contends that a general term,\nsuch as \u2018honor\u2019 or \u2018disgrace\u2019, can have two or\nmore distinct uses, grounded in different bases or \u201cstarting\npoints\u201d (du\u0101n \u7aef). The different uses can be\nspecified by compounding (ji\u0101n \u517c) names in a way\nthat narrows their extension. He argues, for instance, that there are\ntwo kinds of honor and disgrace, \u201cmoral honor and\ndisgrace\u201d and \u201cstatus honor and disgrace.\u201d A person\ncould be honored with high status while in fact being morally\ndisgraceful or held in disgrace while in fact being morally\n honorable.[36]\n The Mohists could similarly distinguish two kinds of killing people,\n\u201cmoral killing\u201d and \u201cimmoral killing.\u201d\n\nWhy don\u2019t they? Part of the explanation, of course, may be\nsimply that this route didn\u2019t occur to them. Writing after the\nMohists and probably building on their work, Xunzi (or his\nghostwriter) seems to have improved on their semantic theory in this\n respect.[37]\n Unlike the Mohists, who as we saw distinguish only\n three sorts\n of names\u2014reaching, kind, and personal\u2014Xunzi distinguishes\nmany possible levels of general terms (g\u00f2ng\nm\u00edng \u5171\u540d), specifically explaining that,\namong general terms, a \u201ccompound\u201d name (such as\n\u2018moral killing\u2019) and a \u201csingle\u201d name (such as\n\u2018killing\u2019) can both refer to the same thing, the single\nname being more general. Xunzi\u2019s approach might help to resolve\nsome of the Mohists\u2019 concerns about name compounding.\n\nBut there may be another, deeper explanation as well. The Mohists seem\nnever to have moved fully beyond the one-name-one-thing view. The idea\nthat each unit of language should denote some discrete kind\n(l\u00e8i \u985e), or part of reality, lingers in their\ntreatment of the robbers example. Their study of name compounding\nshowed that the extension of most phrases is not determined merely by\nsumming the extensions of their component words. Unlike the case of\n\u2018oxen-and-horses\u2019, \u2018white horse\u2019 does not\ndenote the sum of all white things and all horses. The semantics of\nphrases or \u201cexpressions\u201d (c\u00ed \u8fad)\nrequires a separate explanation of its own, beyond our explanation of\nthe semantics of names (m\u00edng \u540d). Yet the\nrobbers example shows the Mohists treating phrases the same way they\nhandle names, attempting to pin down a one-to-one referential relation\nbetween \u2018killing robbers\u2019 or \u2018caring about handsome\nmen\u2019 and distinct kinds of sh\u00ed \u5be6 (stuff,\nsituations). They still seem to assume that the key to distinguishing\nkinds correctly and reliably lies in specifying the discrete kind of\nsh\u00ed denoted by each expression. Specifying one-to-one\nreference relations in this way, so as to eliminate uncertainty or\nambiguity in distinguishing the things denoted by each name, is\nprecisely what texts such as the\n Analects,\n Xunzi, and The Annals of L\u00fc Buwei call\n\u201crectifying names\u201d (zh\u00e8ng m\u00edng\n\u6b63\u540d). So, as Hansen observes (1992, 251), in the\n\u201cLesser Selection\u201d the Mohists are in effect aiming to\nrectify phrases, instead of only names. They stipulate, for instance,\nthat \u2018killing people\u2019 be used to refer only to a certain\nkind of sh\u00ed (stuff, event, situation), distinct from\nthat denoted by \u2018killing robbers\u2019. The simple\none-name-one-thing view has no room for referential ambiguity or for\nterms of different scope, some of whose extensions fall within others.\nIt holds that the extensions of different phrases must be\ndistinct\u2014as, on a commonsense interpretation, those of\n\u2018killing robbers\u2019 and \u2018killing people\u2019 are\nnot\u2014or confusion and error will result. But this view has\ncounterintuitive consequences, and there are more compelling\nalternatives, as we have seen. To more fully exploit the resources\nprovided by their approach to semantics, the Mohists needed to break\nwith the one-name-one-thing model more decisively. \n",
