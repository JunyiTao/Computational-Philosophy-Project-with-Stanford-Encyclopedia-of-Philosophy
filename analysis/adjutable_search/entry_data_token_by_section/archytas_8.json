    "main_text": "Archytas as Mathematician and Harmonic Theorist || Music and Mathematics\n2.2 Music and Mathematics\n\nOne of the most startling discoveries of early Greek science was that\nthe fundamental intervals of music, the octave, the fourth, and the\nfifth, corresponded to whole number ratios of string length. Thus, if\nwe pluck a string of length x and then a string of length\n2x, we will hear the interval of an octave between the two\nsounds. If the two string lengths are in the ratio 4 : 3, we will hear\na fourth, and, if the ratio is 3 : 2, we will hear a fifth. This\ndiscovery that the phenomena of musical sound are governed by whole\nnumber ratios must have played a central role in the Pythagorean\nconception, first expressed by Philolaus, that all things are known\nthrough number (DK 44 B4). The next step in harmonic theory was to\ndescribe an entire octave length scale in terms of mathematical\nratios. The earliest such description of a scale is found in Philolaus\nfr. B6. Philolaus recognizes that, if we go up the interval of a\nfourth from any given note, and then up the interval of a fifth, the\nfinal note will be an octave above the first note. Thus, the octave is\nmade up of a fourth and a fifth. In mathematical terms, the ratios\nthat govern the fifth (3 : 2) and fourth (4 : 3) are added by\nmultiplying the terms and thus produce an octave (3 : 2 \u00d7 4 : 3\n= 12 : 6 = 2 : 1). The interval between the note that is a fourth up\nfrom the starting note and the note that is a fifth up was regarded as\nthe basic unit of the scale, the whole tone, which corresponded to the\nratio of 9 : 8 (subtraction of ratios is carried out by dividing the\nterms, or cross multiplying: 3 : 2 / 4 : 3 = 9 : 8). The fifth was\nthus regarded as a fourth plus a whole tone, and the octave can be\nregarded as two fourths plus a whole tone. The fourth consists of two\nwhole tones with a remainder, which has the unlovely ratio of 256 :\n243 (4 : 3 / 9 : 8 = 32 : 27 / 9 : 8 = 256 : 243). Philolaus\u2019\nscale thus consisted of the following intervals: 9 : 8, 9 : 8, 256 :\n243 [these three intervals take us up a fourth], 9 : 8, 9 : 8, 9 : 8,\n256 : 243 [these four intervals make up a fifth and complete the\noctave from our staring note]. This scale is known as the Pythagorean\ndiatonic and is the scale that Plato adopted in the construction of\nthe world soul in the Timaeus (36a-b).\n\nArchytas took harmonic theory to a whole new level of theoretical and\nmathematical sophistication. Ptolemy, writing in the second century\nAD, identifies Archytas as having \u201cengaged in the study of music\nmost of all the Pythagoreans\u201d (A16). First, Archytas provided a\ngeneral explanation of pitch, arguing that the pitch of a sound\ndepends on the speed with which the sound is propagated and travels\n(B1). Thus, if a stick is waved back and forth rapidly, it will\nproduce a sound that travels rapidly through the air, which will be\nperceived as of a higher pitch than the sound produced by a stick\nwaved more slowly. Archytas is correct to associate pitch with speed,\nbut he misunderstood the role of speed. The pitch does not depend on\nthe speed with which a sound reaches us but rather on the frequency of\nimpacts in a given period of time. A string that vibrates more rapidly\nproduces a sound of a higher pitch, but all sounds, regardless of\npitch, travel at an equal velocity, if the medium is the same.\nAlthough Archytas\u2019 account of pitch was ultimately incorrect, it\nwas very influential. It was taken over and adapted by both Plato and\nAristotle and remained the dominant theory throughout antiquity\n(Barker 1989, 41 n. 47; Barker 2014: 187). Second, Archytas introduced\nnew mathematical rigor into Pythagorean harmonics. One of the\nimportant results of the analysis of music in terms of whole number\nratios is the recognition that it is not possible to divide the basic\nmusical intervals in half. The octave is not divided into two equal\nhalves but into a fourth and a fifth, the fourth is not divided into\ntwo equal halves but into two whole tones and a remainder. The whole\ntone cannot be divided into two equal half tones. On the other hand,\nit is possible to divide a double octave in half. Mathematically this\ncan be seen by recognizing that it is possible to insert a mean\nproportional between the terms of the ratio corresponding to the\ndouble octave (4 : 1) so that 4 : 2 :: 2 : 1. The double octave can\nthus be divided into two equal parts each having a ratio of 2 : 1. The\nratios which govern the basic musical intervals (2 : 1, 4 : 3, 3 : 2,\n9 : 8), all belong to a type of ratio known as a superparticular ratio\n\u2013 roughly speaking, ratios of the form (n + 1) :\nn. Archytas made a crucial contribution by providing a rigorous\nproof that there is no mean proportional between numbers in\nsuperparticular ratio (A19) and hence that the basic musical intervals\ncannot be divided in half. Archytas\u2019 proof was later taken over\nand modified slightly in the Sectio Canonis ascribed to\nEuclid (Prop. 3; see Barker 1989, 195). On Archytas\u2019 proof see\nHuffman 2005: 451\u201370 and Barker 2007: 303\u20135.\n\nArchytas\u2019 final contribution to music theory has to do with the\nstructure of the scale (for a more detailed account than what follows\nsee Huffman 2005: 402\u201325 and Barker 2007: 292\u2013302). The\nGreeks used a number of different scales, which were distinguished by\nthe way in which the fourth, or tetrachord, was constructed. These\nscales were grouped into three main types or genera. One genus was\ncalled the diatonic; one example of this is the Pythagorean diatonic\ndescribed above, which is built on the tetrachord with the intervals 9\n: 8, 9 : 8 and 256 : 243 and was used by Philolaus and Plato. There is\nno doubt that Archytas knew of this diatonic scale, but his own\ndiatonic tetrachord was somewhat different, being composed of the\nintervals 9 : 8, 8 : 7 and 28 : 27. Archytas also defined scales in\nthe two other major genera, the enharmonic and chromatic.\nArchytas\u2019 enharmonic tetrachord is composed of the intervals 5 :\n4, 36 : 35 and 28 : 27 and his chromatic tetrachord of the intervals\n32 : 27, 243 : 224, and 28 : 27. There are several puzzles about the\ntetrachords which Archytas adopts in each of the genera. First, why\ndoes Archytas reject the Pythagorean diatonic used by Philolaus and\nPlato? Second, Ptolemy, who is our major source for Archytas\u2019\ntetrachords (A16), argues that Archytas adopted as a principle that\nall concordant intervals should correspond to superparticular ratios.\nThe ratios in Archytas\u2019 diatonic and enharmonic tetrachords are\nindeed superparticular, but two of the ratios in his chromatic\ntetrachord are not superparticular (32 : 27 and 243 : 224). Why are\nthese ratios not superparticular as well? Finally, Plato criticizes\nPythagorean harmonics in the Republic for seeking numbers in\nheard harmonies rather than ascending to generalized problems (531c).\nCan any sense be made of this criticism in light of Archytas\u2019\ntetrachords? The basis for an answer to all of these questions is\ncontained in the work of Winnington-Ingram (1932) and Barker (1989,\n46-52). The crucial point is that Archytas\u2019 account of the\ntetrachords in each of the three genera can be shown to correspond to\nthe musical practice of his day; Ptolemy\u2019s criticisms miss the\nmark because of his ignorance of musical practice in Archytas\u2019\nday, some 500 years before Ptolemy (Winnington-Ingram 1932, 207).\nArchytas is giving mathematical descriptions of scales actually in\nuse; although mathematical considerations did play a role (Barker\n2007: 295\u2013302), he arrived at his numbers in part by observation\nof the way in which musicians tuned their instruments (Barker 1989,\n50\u201351). He did not follow the Pythagorean diatonic scale because\nit did not correspond to any scale actually in use, although it does\ncorrespond to a method of tuning. The unusual numbers in\nArchytas\u2019 chromatic tetrachord do correspond to a chromatic\nscale in use in Archytas\u2019 day. Ptolemy was wrong to suggest that\nArchytas adhered to the principle that all concordant intervals should\nhave superparticular ratios (Huffman 2005: 422\u20133), although\nBarker suggests that he may have been following a different but\nrelated principle (2007: 301). Archytas thus provides a brilliant\nanalysis of the music of his day, but it is precisely his focus on\nactual musical practice that draws Plato\u2019s ire. Plato does not\nwant him to focus on the music he hears about him (\u201cheard\nharmonies\u201d) but rather to ascend to consider quite abstract\nquestions about which numbers are harmonious with which. Plato might\nwell have welcomed a principle of concordance based solely on\nmathematical considerations, such as the principle that only\nsuperparticular ratios are concordant, but Archytas wanted to explain\nthe numbers of the music he actually heard played. There is an\nimportant metaphysical issue at stake here. Plato is calling for the\nstudy of number in itself, apart from the sensible world, while\nArchytas, like Pythagoreans before him, envisages no split between a\nsensible and an intelligible world and is looking for the numbers\nwhich govern sensible things. For discussions of Archytas as the\ntarget of Plato\u2019s complaints in the  Republic see\nHuffman 2005: 423\u20135 and Barker 2014:192\u20133.\n",
