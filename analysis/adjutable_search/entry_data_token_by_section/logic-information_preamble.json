    "main_text": "\n\nAt their most basic, logic is the study of consequence, and\ninformation is a commodity. Given this, the interrelationship between\nlogic and information will centre on the informational consequences of\nlogical actions or operations conceived broadly. The explicit\ninclusion of the notion of information as an object of\nlogical study is a recent development. It was by the beginning of the\npresent century that a sizable body of existing technical and\nphilosophical work (with precursors that can be traced back to the\n1930s) coalesced into the new emerging field of logic and information\n(see Dunn 2001). This entry is organised thematically, rather than\nchronologically. We survey major logical approaches to the study of\ninformation, as well as informational understandings of logics\nthemselves. We proceed via three interrelated and complementary\nstances: information-as-range, information-as-correlation, and\ninformation-as-code.\n\nThe core intuition motivating the Information-as-range\nstance, is that an\ninformational state may be characterised by the range of possibilities\nor configurations that are compatible with the information available\nat that state. Acquiring new information corresponds to a reduction of\nthat range, thus reducing uncertainty about the actual configuration\nof affairs. With this understanding, the setting of possible-world\nsemantics for epistemic modal logics proves to be rewarding for the\nstudy of various semantic aspects of information. A prominent\nphenomenon here is information update, which may occur in\nboth individual and social settings, due to the interaction between\nboth agents and their environment via different types of epistemic\nactions. We will see that an epistemic action is any action that\nfacilitates the flow of information, hence we will return to epistemic\nactions themselves throughout.\n\nThe Information-as-correlation stance focuses\non information flow as it is licensed within structured systems formed\nby systematically correlated components. For example: the number of\nrings of a tree trunk can give you information about the time when the\ntree was born, in virtue of certain regularities of nature that\n\u2018connect\u2019 the past and present of trees. Central themes of\nthis stance include the aboutness, situatedness, and accessibility\nof information in structured information environments.\n\nThe key concern of the third stance, Information-as-code,\nis the syntax-like\nstructure of information pieces (their encoding) and the\ninference and computation processes that are licensed by\nvirtue (among other things) of that structure. A most natural logical\nsetting to study these informational aspects is the algebraic proof\ntheory underpinned by a range of substructural logics.\nSubstructural logics have always been a natural home for informational\nanalysis, and the recent developments in the area enrich the\ninformation-as-code stance.\n\nThe three stances are by no means incompatible, but neither are they\nnecessarily reducible to each other. This will be expanded on later in\nthe entry, and some further topics of research will be illustrated,\nbut for a preview of how the three stances can live together, take the\ncase of a structured information system composed of several parts.\nFirstly, the correlations between the parts naturally allow for\n\u2018information flow\u2019 in the sense of the\ninformation-as-correlation stance. Secondly, they also give rise to a\nlocal ranges of possibilities, since the local information available\nat one part will be compatible with a certain range of global states\nof the system. Thirdly, the combinatorial, syntax-like,\nproof-theoretical aspects of information can be brought to this\nsetting in various ways. One of them is treating the correlational\nflow of information as a sort of combinatorial system by which local\ninformation states are combined in syntactic-like ways, fitting a\nparticular interpretation of substructural logic. One could also add\ncode-like-structure to the modelling explicitly, for example by\nassigning local deductive calculi to either the components or local\nstates of the system. We begin however with information as\nrange\n",
