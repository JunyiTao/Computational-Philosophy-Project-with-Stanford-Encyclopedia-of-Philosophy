Can states of affairs be the\ncontents of propositional attitudes? Prima facie, the answer\nis No. We have already seen that states of affairs are too\ncoarse-grained to be the contents of propositional attitudes. I can\nbelieve that Hesperus is a planet, without believing that Phosphorus\nis a planet (and vice versa). Hence, the contents of the attitudes\ndiffer. But the state of affairs Hesperus\u2019s being a\nplanet is just the state of affairs Phosphorus\u2019s being\na planet. Propositional attitudes are, at best, mediated\nrelations to states of affairs. For example, a belief represents a\nstate of affairs if, and only if, the believer assents to a thought\nthat describes a state of affairs.\n\nBarcan Marcus has challenged this view. She argued that belief is\n\u201ca relation between a subject or agent and a state of affairs\nthat is not necessarily actual but that has actual objects as its\nconstituents\u201d (Barcan Marcus 1993 [1990]: 240). Her\nobject-centered account of belief identifies belief with a\ndifferential disposition to a state of affairs:\n\n\nx believes that S just in case, under certain\nagent-centered circumstances including x\u2019s\ndesires and needs as well as external circumstances, x\nis disposed to act as if S, that actual or nonactual state of\naffairs, obtains. (Barcan Marcus 1993 [1990]: 241)\n\n\nBelieving that so-and-so does not require concept possession. For\nexample, believing that the sun is shining is a differential\ndisposition to the state of affairs the sun\u2019s shining,\nhowever described or presented.\n\nThe object-centered account of belief contrasts with\nmode-of-presentation-centered or language-centered accounts. The\nobject-centered theory allows us to take belief-ascriptions to\nnon-linguistic creatures to be literally true. However, it runs into\nproblems when it comes to assertoric utterances of sentences\ncontaining empty singular terms. According to the object-centred view,\nthese don\u2019t express beliefs (see Barcan Marcus 1993 [1990]:\n247). While the state of affairs a\u2019s being\nF can exist, although a is not F; it cannot\nexist, if either a or being F doesn\u2019t\nexist. Now take the belief that Napoleon was French. I satisfy all\nintuitive criteria for the possession of this belief. Imagine that we\nfind out that, after all, there was never such a person as Napoleon.\nIt was all a very elaborate hoax. Then there is no state of affairs\ncomposed of Napoleon and being French. Hence, although all\nintuitive criteria may have told us that I believed that Napoleon was\nFrench, we now find out that I never had that belief. This is\ncounter-intuitive and artificial.\n\nTo sum up: Thoughts and states of affairs are different things.\nThoughts cannot be reduced to states of affairs and the reduction of\nstates of affairs to sets of referentially equivalent thoughts is\nunwarranted. We need both thoughts and states of affairs in order to\nfulfill different roles.\n",
