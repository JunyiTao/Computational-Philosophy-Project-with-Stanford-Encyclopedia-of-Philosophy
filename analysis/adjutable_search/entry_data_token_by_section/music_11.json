    "main_text": "Music and Value || Music\u2019s Artistic Value\n5.1 Music\u2019s Artistic Value\n\nMost philosophical discussions of the value of music are implicitly\nrestricted to the artistic value of purely instrumental musical works.\nTo the extent that such discussions are motivated by the\nabstract nature of such music (see below), it is not clear to\nwhat extent they can be extended to musical hybrids such as song.\nMoreover, as we saw in section 1.2, it is not obvious that all music\nis art. Perhaps non-art music can be artistically valuable, but it\npresumably has other values; a complete theory of the value of music\nwould apparently have to account for those values. (Presumably, art\nmusic can also have non-artistic value.)\n\nFollowing the literature, however, the remainder of this subsection\nconsiders the artistic value of purely musical works. This is not the\nplace to go into the many disputes about the nature of aesthetic and\nartistic value. (For an excellent introduction, see Stecker 2003b.)\nFor our purposes, we can note there are two central points about\nartistic value on which there is some consensus. First, most\nphilosophers take the value of artworks to be intrinsic (or\ninherent) to them, in the sense that the value of a work is\ntied essentially to the experience that the work affords. Thus,\nartworks are not (properly) valued merely instrumentally, as means to\nsome end, but \u201cfor\u201d or \u201cin\u201d themselves (Budd\n1995: 1\u201316; S. Davies 1987: 198\u2013200; Scruton 1997:\n374\u20136; Levinson 1992: 15\u201317).\n\nThe question that naturally arises next is what it is about the\nexperience an artwork affords that makes it valuable. That\npleasure is a non-negligible part of the answer to this\nquestion is the second point upon which there is some consensus (S.\nDavies 1987: 198\u2013205; Levinson 1992; Kivy 1997b: 212\u201317).\nHowever, concomitant with this consensus is an acknowledgment that\nsimple pleasure taken, say, in the sensuousness of the musical sounds\nis too trivial to ground the great value widely attributed to music.\nIn looking for other sources, the puzzle that arises is that music is\nsupposed to be an abstract art, par excellence. If this means\nthat music is divorced from everything else that concerns us in the\n\u201creal world\u201d (that is, extra-musical life), it is puzzling\nwhy we should find so valuable the experiences musical works\nafford.\n\nThere are a couple of dimensions to most solutions of the puzzle of\npure music\u2019s value. One is the extent to which it is agreed that\nmusic really is abstract. To the extent that one thinks that music is\nnot divorced from the real world, one will be able to argue\nthat music\u2019s value is at least no more puzzling than the value\nof arts more obviously related to the real world, such as literature\nand representational painting and sculpture. The other dimension to\nmost solutions of the puzzle of pure music\u2019s value is the extent\nto which one thinks the abstractness of music is the source of its\nvalue. Thus, two theorists might agree on the extent to which music is\nrelated to the real world (by being expressive, say), yet one locate\nits primary value in that expressiveness while the other locates it in\nits abstract, purely formal features.\n\nUnsurprisingly, those who take the experience of music\u2019s\nexpressiveness to be a more intimately emotional one (through being\npredicated on imaginative engagement with the music, say), tend to\nemphasize that experience as more central to musical understanding,\nand thus attribute a larger part of music\u2019s value to its\nexpressiveness. Those, on the other hand, whose theory of the\nexperience of musical expressiveness is more distanced (a matter of\nnoticed resemblance, say), tend to place less weight on this element\nin their theories of musical value. At one extreme of this spectrum is\nthe position that denies music to be expressive at all, and thus\ncannot attribute any of music\u2019s value to its expressiveness\n(most notably Hanslick 1854; see also Zangwill 2004). Most theorists\nagree, however, that music\u2019s value is to be located in different\nkinds of experience, including the experience of formal and expressive\nfeatures; their disagreements are mostly about the relative weight of\nthese different kinds of experiences in a complete account of musical\nvalue.\n\nThe extent of the disagreement between various parties to this dispute\nis not clear. Those defending the value of music\u2019s\nexpressiveness tend to claim that its contribution to overall musical\nvalue is significant, but many stop short even of according it primary\nvalue, and do not argue against the value of formal elements of\nmusical works (Ridley 1995: 192\u20136; Levinson 1982, 1992:\n20\u20132, 1996a: 124\u20135; Robinson 2005: 413; Young 2014:\n150\u20134). They content themselves rather with pointing out the\nways in which expressiveness can be valuable, focusing largely on the\nvalue of the emotional responses such expressiveness elicits in us.\nThese include many of the features discussed above with respect to our\ninterest in listening to music that arouses negative affective states\nin the listener. To recap, our emotional responses to music\u2019s\nexpressiveness can enable us to savor, understand, and even (to some\nextent) experience emotions in a \u201csafe\u201d way. They can\nprovide us with a cathartic release, and enable us to participate in a\nkind of communication with the composer or communion with other\nmembers of our musical culture (Levinson 1982, 1996a; Higgins 1991,\n2012; S. Davies 1994: 271). Emphasizing this last point, Roger Scruton\nargues that music\u2019s value is quasi-moral, in that the kinds of\nmusic one responds to, or those valued in a particular culture,\nreflect the state of that individual\u2019s or culture\u2019s\n\u201csoul\u201d (1997: 380\u201391; see also S. Davies 1994:\n275\u20136.) Stephen Davies (1987: 207\u201312) has argued that\nthere are beneficial consequences of an interest in music in\ngeneral, such as heightened emotional and aural sensitivity,\nwhich are not properly valued as consequences of listening to\nindividual pieces, but which lead us to value musical culture as a\nwhole (just as we value kindness for its consequences in general,\nwhile rejecting instrumental motivations for kind acts as\ninappropriate).\n\nBy contrast, those who defend the value of formal features tend to\nargue that the value of those features is primary, and that the value\nof music\u2019s expressiveness is overrated. Peter Kivy, for\ninstance, argues that expressive properties serve merely to\nhighlight musical structure, as color might be used by the painter to\nemphasize contour or mass. Other expressive properties serve as\nstructural properties in their own right (1990: 196). (See also\nSharpe 2000: 1\u201383, and Zangwill 2004.)\n\nAlan Goldman (1992) argues against the idea that music is particularly\nsuited to the expression of emotion, claiming that representational\narts such as painting and literature are better at this. Moreover, he\ndisputes the grounds of the value of expressiveness given above. For\nexample, he denies that music can teach us much about the emotions,\nand that we can savor our negative emotional responses to expressive\nmusic. Similarly, after an extensive discussion of the nature of\nmusical expressiveness, Malcolm Budd argues that such expressiveness\ncannot come close to explaining music\u2019s value (1995:\n155\u20137). He points to the facts that much valuable music is not\nexpressive and that the equal expressiveness of different pieces would\nbe outweighed in a comparative evaluation by the differences between\nthem in terms of formal value.\n\nBoth Goldman and Budd locate the value of pure music precisely in the\nabstractness that to some seems the greatest obstacle to explaining\nthat value. Budd (1995: 164\u201371) points out that we have an\nextensive interest in abstract forms outside the realm of music, such\nas those of natural formations and in the decorative arts, and that\nsuch forms are capable of possessing valued aesthetic properties, such\nas beauty, elegance, and so on. Thus, it is no surprise that we value\nhighly the works of an art of abstract forms. Goldman (1992),\nby contrast, emphasizes the detachment from the world of practical\naffairs implied by music\u2019s abstractness. The complexity of great\nmusical works demands the active engagement of our cognitive\nfaculties, which we find rewarding, yet not in the pursuit of some\npractical goal that could be frustrated.\n\nThese issues are thrown into sharp relief in the debate over how\ninstrumental musical works could be \u201cprofound.\u201d See Kivy\n1990: 202\u201318, 1997b: 140\u201378, 2003; Levinson 1992; White\n1992; Ridley 1995, 2004: 132\u201365; S. Davies 2002b; Dodd\n2014b.\n\nThere is no space here to discuss the evaluation of musical works and\nperformances. See S. Davies 1987, Levinson 1990e, and Gracyk 2011.\n",
