    "main_text": "The Conciliar Movement\n15. The Medieval Tradition of Political Philosophy\n\nAlthough political philosophy was not part of the core curriculum in\nthe universities, and although the writings surveyed above were\ngenerally not produced with the idea of contributing to a\nphilosophical discipline, by the end of the middle ages the discipline\nof political philosophy (or political theology) had attained\nself-consciousness and a sense of constituting a tradition. Manuscript\ncopies of political writings by different authors were often bound\ntogether as volumes (Ouy 1979). There was a readership to which such\nworks could be addressed (Miethke 1980, 2000b). Su\u00e1rez and\nother late scholastic writers gave an outline of the history of a\nproblem and surveyed what others had said about it. In the sixteenth\nand seventeenth centuries a number of collections of political\nwritings were published, e.g., by Dupuy (1655) and Goldast\n (1611\u20134).[77]\n Early modern writers such as Hooker, Grotius, Hobbes, and Locke could\neasily find the works of at least some writers who had written on\npolitics during the middle ages or would know of their ideas at least\nby\n hearsay.[78]\n\n\nIf there is a theme to this history, it is perhaps the development of\npolitical\n liberalism,\n though, to be sure, ideals of\n constitutionalism\n (see, e.g., Tierney 1982, Pennington 1993a, Lee 2016),\n civic humanism,\n and\n republicanism\n (on these last two, see, e.g., Skinner 1978; Hankins 2000) may be\nfound among different medieval\n authors.[79]\n The liberal trend was helped, perhaps paradoxically, by the close\ninterweaving of religion with other threads of medieval life. This\nmeant not only that religion influenced all aspects of life, but also,\nreciprocally, that the other departments of life influenced religious\nthinking. The influence of the Roman Law and Aristotle, and of the\nculture of late antiquity familiar to the Fathers of the Church, also\nmeant that ideas originating outside the framework of the Christian\nreligion had an impact on religious thinking. The duality between\nkingship and priesthood (perhaps originally due merely to the fact\nthat Christians had no political power), and the conflicts that\nresulted from that duality, meant that religious thinking had to\naccommodate the concerns of powerful people who were not officials in\nthe religious institutions.\n\nFrom the time of Constantine, and in the west especially from the time\nof Augustine, Christians practiced the coercion of heretics and the\nrepression of unbelief. However, their regime was never completely\nrepressive. Among medieval political philosopher-theologians there was\nalways some acknowledgment of the rights of unbelievers (e.g., of the\nrights of Jewish parents, the Church\u2019s lack of jurisdiction over\n\u201cthose without\u201d, the property rights of unbelievers).\nThere was a recognition of the duty to reason and persuade (\u201cA\nman cannot believe unless he is willing\u201d). In social relations\nthere was a belief in an underlying liberty and equality, and a belief\nthat originally government and slavery did not exist, an idea that\ngovernment, law, and property arose by \u201cpact\u201d or custom,\nand an idea that originally government belonged to \u201cthe\npeople\u201d and was entrusted to rulers by the consent of the\npeople. These beliefs were akin to the modern liberal presumption in\nfavour of personal liberty. There was a belief in the \u201crule of\nlaw\u201d, in a distinction between good government and tyranny, in\n\u201cnatural rights\u201d. There was a belief in limited government\n(see Ockham in\n \u00a713.3)\n and in a distinction (not yet a separation) between Church and State.\nConcerning the constitution of the Church, a strong claim for\nunfettered papal power was made by some popes and their supporters,\nbut this was strongly resisted by writers who argued that a heretic or\nsinful pope, including one who violated the rights of the laity and of\nunbelievers, could be deposed. Something like freedom of speech was\nembodied in the practice of disputation. Ockham explicitly advocated\nfree discussion of disagreements among Christians. Where all this\nstill fell short of political liberalism was the absence of any\nargument for equal freedom of all religions. Locke,\n Bayle,\n and others in the seventeenth century advocated toleration, though\nnot for Catholics, since Catholics themselves rejected equal freedom\nof religion and were dangerous to others.\n\nThe arguments of medieval political philosophers are only partly\navailable in modern political philosophy. Non-believers cannot make\nmuch use of arguments with theological premises. But even for us,\nthere is perhaps some value in the reminder that, under some\ncircumstances, a religious tradition is capable of\ndeveloping\u2014not only in response to external pressure but even\nout of its own resources\u2014in the direction of peace and\ncooperation between members of the two cities.\n",
