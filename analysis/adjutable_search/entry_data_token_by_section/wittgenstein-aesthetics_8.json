The Comparative Approach\n\n\nComparison, and the intricate process of grouping together certain\ncases\u2014where such comparative juxtaposition usually casts certain\nsignificant features of the work or works in question in higher\nrelief, where it leads to the emergence of an organizational\n gestalt,[6]\n where it shows the evolution of a style, or where it shows what is\nstrikingly original about a work, among many other things\u2014also\nfocuses our attention on the particular case in another way. In\nleading our scrutiny to critically and interpretatively relevant\nparticularities, it leads us away from the aesthetically blinding\npresumption that it is the effect, brought about by the\n\u201ccause\u201d of that particular work, that matters (so that any\nminuet that gives a certain feeling or awakens certain images would do\nas well as any other).\n",
