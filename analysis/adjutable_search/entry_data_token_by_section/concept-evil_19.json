    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Evil Character/Personhood || Motivation-Based Accounts\n4.3 Motivation-Based Accounts\n\nAccording to motivation-based accounts, to be an evil person is to be\nmotivated in a certain sort of way. For instance, Todd Calder argues\nthat to be an evil person it is sufficient to have a regular\npropensity for e-desires. An e-desire is a motivational state that\nconsists in a desire for what is correctly believed to be someone\nelse\u2019s significant harm for an unworthy goal or for what would\ncorrectly be believed to be someone else\u2019s significant harm for\nan unworthy goal in the absence of self-deception (see Section 3.5.3\nfor more on self-deceptive evil). According to Calder, significant\nharm is desired for an unworthy goal if a state of affairs\nconsisting of the achievement of the goal together with the harm would\nbe less valuable than if the goal was not achieved and the harm was\navoided (Calder 2003 and 2009. See also Card, 2002, 21 for a similar\nview).\n\nA problem for motivation-based accounts is to explain why we should\njudge someone as evil based solely on her motivations. In other words,\nwhy judge someone as the morally worst sort of person for having\ncertain desires if these desires do not result in significant harm?\nWhy not judge people as evil only if they actually cause significant\nharm? One way to respond to this objection is to point out that even\nif e-desires do not result in significant harm on some particular\noccasion or for some particular person, e-desires do, for most people\nmost of the time, lead to significant harm (Julia Driver\u2019s\nconsequentialist theory of virtue and vice (2001) uses a similar line\nof thought). Or else, a proponent of a motivation-based account could\ninsist that judgments of evil character look inward to an\nagent\u2019s psychology and not to the effects (or likely effects) of\nher actions (See Calder 2007b for a similar view about virtue and\nvice).\n\nHowever, if we insist that judgements of evil character look inward to\nan agent\u2019s psychology and not to the effects of her actions, why\njudge evil character solely on the basis of her motives? Why not take\ninto account the agent\u2019s affective states as well? (Haybron\n2002b, 267)\n",
