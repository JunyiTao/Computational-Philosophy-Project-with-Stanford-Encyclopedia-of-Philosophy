    "main_text": "Arguments for and Objections to Russellian Monism || Arguments for Russellian Monism\n3.1 Arguments for Russellian Monism\n\nRussellian monists usually support their theory by arguing that it has\nsignificant theoretical benefits. We will describe three such\narguments, which appeal to closely related considerations. (For other\narguments for Russellian monism see, for example, Rosenberg 2004;\nStrawson 2006a; Goff 2017; Schneider 2018.)\n\nThe first argument is based on the claim that Russellian monism\ncombines theoretical virtues of traditional dualism with those of\ntraditional physicalism, while avoiding their main drawbacks (Chalmers\n2013). The reasoning behind that claim could be stated as follows.\nTraditional physicalism has the virtue of allowing consciousness to be\nintegrated into physical causation. But this comes at the cost of\ndisregarding or distorting the distinctive features of consciousness.\nTraditional dualism avoids that cost. But by separating consciousness\nfrom the physical world, traditional dualism prevents consciousness\nfrom being integrated into physical causation. The latter cost is\nfamously articulated by Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, in her\ncriticism of Cartesian dualism (Elisabeth to Descartes, 21 May, 1643\n[1984: v. 3, 218; AT III 665]; see the entry\n Elisabeth, Princess of Bohemia),\n and by related causal arguments for physicalism such as the\nfollowing:\n\n\nMany effects that we attribute to conscious causes have full physical\ncauses. But it would be absurd to suppose that these effects are\ncaused twice over. So the conscious causes must be identical to some\npart of those physical causes. (Papineau 2002: 17; cf. Kim 1989,\n1998).\n\n\nBy contrast, Russellian monism seems to avoid those costs of both\ntraditional physicalism and traditional dualism. On Russellian monism,\nthe properties that constitute consciousness\u2014quiddities and\n(perhaps) structural properties\u2014play indispensable roles in\nphysical causation. Consciousness \u2014or at least the components of\nconsciousness \u2014is thus integrated into physical causation. Yet\nthe distinctive features of consciousness are neither disregarded nor\ndistorted. Those features are attributed to quiddities and their\nspecial (e.g., constitutive) relationship to consciousness.\n\nA second argument for Russellian monism is based on the claim that\nthis theory offers an elegant, unified solution to two distinct\nphilosophical problems (Lockwood 1989, 1992; Chalmers 1996, 2013\n[2015: 254]; Rosenberg 2004; Goff 2017; cf. Russell 1927a, 1927b:\n116). One of those problems is how to provide a foundation for the\nspatiotemporal structure physics describes. The other is how to\nintegrate consciousness into physical causation. When considered from\nthe perspective of a Russellian monist, these two problems seem made\nfor each other. The requisite foundation of spatiotemporal structure\nis provided by (proto)phenomenal quiddities. Because those same\nquiddities (partly or wholly) constitute consciousness, consciousness\nthereby plays a distinctive role in physical causation\u2014or at\nleast the components of consciousness play that role. Thus, the\nreasoning runs, both problems are solved at once.\n\nA third argument for Russellian monism is based on the claim that\nRussellian monism provides a plausible response to anti-materialist\narguments such as the conceivability argument and the knowledge\nargument (see the entries\n zombies\n and\n qualia: the knowledge argument\n and Alter 2023). The conceivability argument is often formulated in\nterms of a zombie world (Chalmers 1996): a physical and\nfunctional duplicate of the actual world but without consciousness. It\nis first argued that a zombie world is ideally conceivable, which\nmeans roughly that such a world cannot be ruled out as incoherent by\na priori reasoning (Chalmers 2002). It is then argued that\nthe ideal conceivability of such a world entails its metaphysical\npossibility. Finally, it is argued that the metaphysical possibility\nof such a world entails that physicalism is false. The knowledge\nargument begins with Frank Jackson\u2019s (1982, 1986, 1995) case of\nMary, the brilliant scientist in the black-and-white room, who comes\nto know the complete physical truth by reading black-and-white science\nbooks and watching science lectures on a black-and-white monitor. If\nphysicalism were true, Jackson reasons, then Mary would thereby know\neverything there is to know about seeing in color: she could deduce\nthat information from her physical knowledge. But, he claims, this is\nnot the case. On the contrary, when Mary leaves the room she learns\ntruths about what it is like to see in color \u2013 truths she did\nnot already know.\n\nAccording to Russellian monism, those arguments might show that\nstructure alone does not fully determine (metaphysically necessitate)\nthe nature or even the existence of consciousness. But it does not\nfollow that physicalism is false. At most, it follows that\ntraditional physicalist theories are false, because those\ntheories limit the physicalist\u2019s resources to the structural.\nRussellian physicalism, on which the class of physical truths\nincludes not only structural truths but quiddistic truths as well, is\nnot threatened (Stoljar 2001). Further, this anti-structuralist thesis\ncomports well with the claim that consciousness consists at least\npartly in non-structural quiddities\u2014a claim that is central to\nRussellian monism generally, not just the physicalist variety\n (section 1).\n\nThat response can be developed in different ways, such as rejecting\nepistemic premises on which the anti-materialist arguments rely (for\nother ways, see Chalmers 2010: 134\u2013135; Pereboom 2011; Alter and\nNagasawa 2012: 83\u201386). Regarding the conceivability argument,\nRussellian physicalists can argue as follows. On reflection, a zombie\nworld is not ideally conceivable. If such a world initially appears\nconceivable, this is because we mistake a zombie world for a\nstructural zombie world: a consciousness-free world that\n(minimally) duplicates all of the actual world\u2019s structural\nfeatures. If there is an ideally conceivable world in the vicinity,\nthen that world is a structural zombie world. There is no good reason\nto accept the ideal conceivability of a full-fledged zombie world,\nwhich would lack consciousness despite duplicating not only the actual\nworld\u2019s structural features but its quiddistic features as well.\nRegarding the knowledge argument, Russellian physicalists can argue\nthat because Mary\u2019s black-and-white science lessons leave out\nquiddistic information, those lessons teach her only part of the\nphysical truth. If so, then the truths she learns when she leaves\nmight be physical. They would be non-structural quiddistic truths but\nphysical truths nonetheless.\n",
