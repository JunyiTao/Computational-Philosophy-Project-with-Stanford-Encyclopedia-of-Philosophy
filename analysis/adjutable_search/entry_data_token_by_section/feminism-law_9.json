These are among the few\nuncontroversial principles accepted in all moral systems and form the\ncore of the criminal law in every society. Keeping peace and order has\nlong been considered a fundamental justification for the very\nexistence of the state or legal authority. Many philosophers have\nexplicitly supported this idea, even those who argue for limitations\non the state.\n J.S. Mill,\n for example, argued that the only legitimate reason for interference\nby the state in the affairs of individuals is to prevent one person\nfrom harming another. Thomas Hobbes argued that peace (i.e., personal\nsecurity) is the ultimate political value for which a rational\nindividual would sign on to the social contract justifying state power\nto protect the security of every man from the potential threat of\nevery other (see the entry on\n Hobbes\u2019 moral and political philosophy).\n And\n Montesquieu\n defined political liberty as the tranquility of mind that comes from\nnot being subject to fear for one\u2019s safety. To achieve such\ntranquility of mind he proposed the separation of (governmental)\npowers to retard the abuse of power that could so threaten the\nsecurity of citizens. From\n Confucius\n and Lao Tzu to Mohammed or Gandhi, and from the Ten Commandments to\nthe Code of Hammurabi, personal security\u2014freedom from\nfear\u2014is a value that the state is expected to secure and\nmaintain.\n\nUntil the 20th century, however, these commitments did not\nprotect women from a frequent source of danger, their intimates: \nhusbands, lovers, relatives, friends, or employers. Indeed, for much\nof history these common threats to the personal security of women were\nnot recognized as harms at all that it was the business of the state\nto address. Instead, they were frequently taken to be inevitable, a\nmatter of right, or justifiable. Not surprisingly, a great deal of\nfeminist legal scholarly attention and reform effort has been directed\nto revealing and changing the many ways in which law fails to protect\nwomen and girls against forms of violence such as rape (including date\nrape and marital rape), domestic abuse, sexual harassment, and other\ntypes of abuse. Although some countries do not collect official data\nand the nature and incidence of such violence varies widely by\nculture, many studies indicate that no society is exempt from these\nforms of violence. The 2012\n United Nations Millennium Development Goals Report\n observed that although equal numbers of boys and girls are now\nattending school across the globe, violence against women continues to\nundermine progress towards all goals. \n\nIn legal theory about gendered violence, the possibility of separating\nthe public from the private sphere is critical. Historically law did\nnot address injuries inflicted by intimates. So, while the single\ngreatest civil purpose of law has been to keep men from violating one\nanother (the only greater being to repel foreign invasion), much\nviolation of women by men has been considered as a private matter\nbeyond the purview of law. Domestic chastisement was once considered\nlegitimate discipline of one\u2019s wife and marital rape was\nexcluded from the definition of rape in many criminal law statutes.\nFeminists criticized the presumption that such behavior among\nintimates was beyond the purview of the criminal law and these\nlimitations have largely been overcome, at least in the United States\nand Europe.\n\nMany other problematic aspects of rape law have also been revised in\nlight of feminist critiques. Historically, rape by an acquaintance was\nnot seen as \u201creal rape\u201d (Estrich 1987) but as more likely\nconsensual sex. Acquaintance rape was made virtually impossible to\nprove by strict corroboration requirements and other rules of\nevidence. Another hurdle to proof of rape presented by the rules of\nevidence was the requirement of active resistance: victims who did not\nactively resist\u2014including those who were most terrorized or who\nfeared harm from resistance\u2014were judged to have consented to\nwhatever happened to them, or at least to have reasonably appeared to\ntheir attackers as consenting (McGregor 2007). Victims also were\ndiscouraged from pursuing complaints by evidence rules that permitted\nthem to be examined about past sexual histories, thus forcing them to\nreveal intimate private matters and subjecting them to judgment as\nimmoral themselves. Victims who delayed reporting alleged rapes,\nperhaps out of shame or fear, were considered not to have made a fresh\ncomplaint and thus to be less credible. Many of these rules have been\nformally overturned but it is less clear whether as a practical matter\nthey continue to infect decisions such as whether to prosecute, how to\nexamine witnesses, or how to assess the credibility of witnesses.\n\nContemporary discussions of the definition and proof of rape continue\nto struggle with questions such as what consent to sex really means.\nSome feminists have argued that there is a domain of wrongful sex that\nis different from rape; Cahill (2016), for example, argues that sex\nthat occurs within context of structural injustice is unjust sex that\nmay be within a gray area of ambiguity. She distinguishes cases in\nwhich the woman is less than fully willing, cases in which the\nwoman\u2019s will is clearly overcome, and cases in which the victim\ncannot fully consent due to incapacity. What distinguishes these types\nof cases, Cahill says, is how the victim\u2019s sexual agency is\ndeployed. She characterizes as unjust sex in the gray area in which\nthe woman\u2019s sexual agency is actively sought but undermined for\nexample in circumstances in which her consent is simply expected or in\nwhich it is difficult for her to express unwillingness. Subtle\ndiscussions such as this illuminate why some rape cases are so\ndifficult for law to handle, as law deals in bright line\ndeterminations such as whether conduct was criminal. Allegations of\nrape in contexts in which one of the parties is under the influence of\ndrugs or alcohol also place pressure on the idea of agency in the\ncontext of sex. Heyes (2016) explores the phenomenology of agency and\nthe harms of assaults involving victims who are semiconscious or\nunconscious.\n\nDifficulties about consent and proof attend other forms of violence\nagainst women as wll. Incest, like rape, was always illegal but rarely\nadmitted, let alone prosecuted. Prosecutors were all too willing to\ndrop charges when women chose not to press them, potentially confusing\nrespect for the victim\u2019s choices with her fear of embarrassment\nor coercion. And sexual harassment (like sex discrimination) simply\ndid not exist as legal claims until the 1960s or later (MacKinnon\n& Siegel 2004; MacKinnon 1979). So it is clear not only that equal\nprotection of law for women was not recognized until recently, but\nalso that the force of law was used to back male dominance. If a man\nwere attacked on the street he could pursue his attacker in the courts\nof law. If a woman were attacked in her home she had no legal cause of\naction as it was considered a private matter. Many feminist critics\ncontend that in important respects such domestic violence amnesia\ncontinues to characterize how law functions (Dempsey 2009). This is\ntrue in both criminal law and the law of private damages, according to\nthese critics (Chamallas & Wriggins 2010).\n\nOver the past 30 years or so, many jurisdictions across the globe have\nenacted major improvements in formal legal protections against\nviolence once considered private. Rape laws have been reformed to\nvarying degrees in many societies, although even the best arguably\nstill have far to go (McGregor 2005; Estrich 2001; Taslitz 1999;\nSchulhofer 1998). For example, most western nations no longer require\ncorroboration of rape by witnesses. In many jurisdictions, consent is\nno longer presumed from the absence of resistance and far stricter\nrequirements for the relevance of evidence are in place. Feminist\nlawyers have worked hard to secure these legal reforms and they\nrepresent important achievements. International law too has recognized\nthe rape of women in war as a crime against humanity (see the United\nNations International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia page on\n Crimes of Sexual Violence),\n and prosecutions for this crime have recently taken place for the\nfirst time in history. Sexual harassment and sex discrimination are\nnow rather widely recognized as wrongful behavior and legal causes of\naction in a variety of forms.\n\nDespite this significant progress in formal law, crime statistics\ncontinue to verify that violence against women remains a problem of\nmajor proportions. Reporting rates are low. Conviction rates in no\nsense reflect a full commitment to punishing these crimes on a par\nwith punishment of other crimes (Estrich 2001; Schulhofer 1998). The\nresult of such enforcement failure, feminists contend, is that in\npractice men have almost the same powers over women that were\nhistorically enshrined in law. A woman may no longer be legally\nrequired to remain with a husband who beats her, but if she has\nnowhere to go, no income or employment opportunities but children to\nsupport, then her restriction is in practice the same as it was in the\npast (see Gendercide Watch;\n WomenWatch).\n Given long-standing customs of subordination, the traditional\ndisparity of power, and the typical difference in size and strength\nbetween men and women, the threat of physical harm and the\ndifferential exercise of economic and political power are sufficient\nto maintain male dominance unless the law intercedes to counteract\nthese forces (Husseini 2007; Manderson 2003; Schneider 2000; Rhode\n1997). Both in the US and elsewhere, immigrant or undocumented women\nmay be particularly vulnerable both to their partners and to\nenforcement failures.\n\nSo, why hasn\u2019t the law interceded more successfully? Feminist\ntheorists give different answers to this question. Liberal feminists\nmay focus on biased attitudes of police officers, prosecutors, and\njudges, the majority of whom are male. Other feminists point to\npersistent economic inequality between women and men, with resulting\ndependency that makes it difficult for women to leave abusive\nrelationships or to resist harassment. For example, Schultz (2003)\nargues that opposition to sexual harassment should not be identified\nwith opposition to sex in the workplace but instead with opposition to\npractices that tend to exclude women from jobs and with a vision of\ngenuine equality at work.\n\nDominance feminists offer the more radical critique that the\npervasiveness, seriousness, and tenacity of male threats and the\ninadequacy of official responses reflect the patriarchal construction\nof gender itself on a model of dominance and submission. That is, the\nlaw reflects a way of thinking on which masculinity means strength,\nforcefulness, aggressiveness, and domination and femininity means\ndelicacy, resistance, submission, and subordination. The distinction\nbetween persuasion and force appears as a fine line that is easy to\ncross. If the distinction between normal sexual behavior and rape\nturns on a last minute decision by a woman to stop resisting and\nsubmit, then it will hardly be surprising if rape turns out to be both\nvery pervasive and widely denied (McGregor 2005; MacKinnon 1989).\nFurthermore, if the very concept of masculinity is not just strength\nbut domination, then resorting to violence to enforce female\nsubordination is a clear correlate of the model. If standards of\nreasonableness\u2014what it is reasonable to expect partners to\nunderstand, to ask, and to do\u2014are male, the boundaries of\nacceptable behavior will look very different than if judgments of\nreasonableness are understood to be gendered\u2014and, largely, male.\nFinally, if the natural relation between the sexes is taken to be both\nhierarchical and adversarial, then a male dominated legal system\nformulated by men from a male perspective is bound to protect the\ninterests of men at the expense of women whenever the two conflict or\nare perceived to conflict. Thus, the patriarchal construction of\ngender makes domination the model of masculinity and rape (or at least\npower and submission) the model of sex (MacKinnon & Siegel 2004;\nEstrich 2001, 1987; Schneider 2000; Schulhofer 1998; MacKinnon\n1989).\n\nThis dominance critique has been widely misunderstood, however.\nCritics of the dominance approach characterize it as condemning all\nsex and indicting all men as rapists, but this criticism is to some\nextent unfair. A few exaggerated claims made by some feminists, highly\npublicized in the early 1970s, did condemn all sex. But in a more\nenduring sense the dominance critique relies on several observations\nthat illustrate the truth of feminist claims about the entrenchment of\npatriarchy as the status quo and the domination model of sexuality.\nMany feminists claim that the use of sex to dominate is pervasive,\naffecting how people think and interact in all cultures (Schneider\n2000; MacKinnon 1989). Critics interpret this observation as a claim\nthat every sexual act is an act of domination (or rape), an inference\nthat does not follow from the general observation about the role of\nsex in oppression. Part of the reason for reinterpretation is that\nonce again feminists are arguing against the norm. If feminists are\ncorrect that domination is the patriarchal model of sexuality and\npatriarchy is the status quo, then it is not surprising if they appear\nto be arguing against all sex itself, at least according to anyone who\ncannot envision an alternative model of sex.\n\nInitially, feminists were divided in how to address the dominance\nmodel of sexuality in law and society. Focusing on causes or\ninfluences, some feminists attempted to challenge media stereotypes,\nan approach for which they were criticized as censors. Some challenged\nthe fashion and beauty industry with minuscule impact while suffering\nconsiderable personal ridicule for their efforts. Some focused on\nopposing pornography (especially violent pornography) as the symbol of\nthe dominance model and developed model anti-pornography statutes for\njurisdictions to enact (see the entry on\n pornography and censorship).\n When one jurisdiction\u2014Indianapolis\u2014did enact a statute\nproviding injunctive relief and a damages remedy for violent\npornography, it was quickly held to be an unconstitutional violation\nof free speech\n (American Booksellers v. Hudnut,\n (771 F.2d 323 (7th Cir. 1985)).  That the feminist message of\nopposing female subordination was criticized as a Victorian\ncondemnation of immoral sex, some feminists contended, illustrated the\ndeep entrenchment of the domination model. Instead, feminists\nsuggested developing better models of masculinity (MacKinnon &\nSiegel 2004; Estrich 2001; Rhode 1997). More recently, many feminists\nhave explored the role of structural injustice in maintaining gender\noppression (e.g. Parekh 2011))\n\nConflicts continue to this day over the permissible limits on free\nspeech, both where sex is involved and more generally. The development\nof video and robotic technologies that allow highly realistic\nsimulations of degrading or violent sexual acts have placed additional\nchallenges to regulatory efforts, as these depictions do not require\nhuman performance and thus do not directly harm individuals creating\nthe depictions. Some argue that viewing these materials should be\ncriminalized because this conduct is wrongful and it can be the proper\nobject of the criminal law to punish wrongdoing even when it does not\nharm others directly (Danaher 2017). Feminists have pointed out that\ndrawing the line for state intervention at direct harm to others hews\nclosely to problematic distinctions between the public and the private\ndrawn by Millian liberals. Bracewell (2016) observes in addition that\nthe earlier ordinances advocated by MacKinnon and others proposed\ndamage remedies and injunctive relief rather than criminalization; the\ncarceral turn against violent speech is more readily aligned with\nliberalism\u2019s delineation of the proper role of the state as\nharm-prevention. Indeed, the U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down\nCalifornia\u2019s statute imposing civil fines for the sale of\nviolent video games to minors rested on the liberal view that\ncontent-based regulation of speech is impermissible,\n Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association,\n 564 U.S. 786 (2011).\n\nFinally, feminist legal scholars have proposed legislation and trial\npractice procedures that would treat domestic violence as part of a\nsystematic cultural environment that discriminates against women\n(Schneider 2000). These proposals are regularly undermined by (well\nmeaning) therapeutic models that treat domestic violence as individual\npsychological problems of anger management or substance abuse or the\nlike, rather than as part of a widespread social problem. Medical\napproaches often depersonalize the issue as family dysfunction. The\nmale perpetrator seems to disappear and responsibility fades as though\nthe harm were caused by a disease rather than by a violent man, a\nresponsible human agent. Clearly countering entrenched acceptance of\nmale violence against women will take long-term, concerted effort.\nImpressive gains have been made, but much more is needed (MacKinnon\n2006; Husseini 2007; Manderson 2003; Schneider 2000; Hassan 1998).\n",
