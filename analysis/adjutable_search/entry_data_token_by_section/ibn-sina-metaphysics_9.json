Indeed, even unity is\nan attribute or a concomitant added to quiddity as it exists\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, V, 1, 200, 13\u2013201, 3; 201,\n8\u201313). So, while for Aristotle \u201cbeing\u201d and\n\u201cone\u201d are coextensive\u2014being one is a per se\nattribute of being\u2014(they are not identical in meaning, although\nAristotle presents this possibility: Metaph. 1003b25), for\nAvicenna being and one are per se attributes of a thing, so\nthat being and one are coextensive, although not identical in meaning,\nand this is so whenever we can speak of a \u201cthing\u201d (Druart\n2001; Wisnovsky 2003a, esp. 158\u201360) i.e., always excepting the\nPrinciple. Consequently there is the difficulty of conceiving\n\u201cone\u201d as both univocal and transcendental: being and being\none coincide only because they are both said of every category and do\nnot indicate a substance (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, III, 2, 103,\n7\u20139). Unity\u2014which is an accident in the category of\nquantity\u2014is indivisibility; it is said in terms of priority and\nposteriority\u2014with a certain ambiguity or modulation\n(bi-l-ta\u0161k\u012bk)\u2014of several things\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, III, 2, 97, 4\u20135; 99, 13\u201314;\nbut cf. Averroes on Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics,\n39\u201342; Menn 2013) and cannot coincide with being because\notherwise multiplicity could not be (unity and\nmultiplicity\u2014which derives from unity\u2014cannot be opposite:\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, III, 3, 104, 6\u20137; 6, 129,\n11\u2013130, 7).\n",
