    "main_text": "Procreative Autonomy || Defenses of a right to procreate\n2.1 Defenses of a right to procreate\n\nA negative moral right to procreate\u2014also discussed under the\nlabel of \u201creproductive liberty\u201d or \u201cprocreative\nliberty\u201d\u2014may be grounded in autonomy rights to control\none\u2019s body and make certain important decisions for oneself\n(Dworkin 1993). Violations could involve direct physical coercion such\nas rape or forced abortion or sterilization, or coercive interference\nwith decisions regarding sexual activity or contraception. Involuntary\nphysical interventions such as forced contraception, sterilization, or\nabortion were practiced in twentieth-century eugenic movements. Their\nwrongness is now generally acknowledged, but critics see continuity\nbetween such racist policies and contemporary moderately coercive\npolicies such as making contraceptive implants the condition of\nmedical aid for impoverished women, particularly for women of color\n(see Roberts 1997).\n\nA right to procreate may also be grounded in the strong interest\npeople have in creating a child, giving birth, and parenting\n(Robertson 1994). Because this justification does not concern a right\nto use one\u2019s body, but to realize the important interest in\ncreating and rearing a child, it can be taken to imply a positive (as\nwell as a negative) right to procreate. Such a positive right could\nalso entail a claim to sufficient environmental resources to raise\nchildren justly (Gheaus 2016a; Roberts 2015) or to funding for ART\n(Robertson 1994). Given that a distinct right to parent could be met\nthrough adoption, some suggest that financial barriers to ART where\nchildren are available for adoption would be justified (De Wispelaere\nand Weinstock 2014). Others have criticized the way that focusing on a\nright to procreate perpetuates the \u201cbiogenetic bias\u201d that\nfavors genetic ties over social ones (Boucai 2016) or challenged the\nidea that the value of establishing a parenting relationship can\nground a right to create someone with the special vulnerabilities of\nchildren to their parents (Hannan and Leland 2018).\n\nLiberal theory has tended to support some sort of right to procreative\nautonomy. At its strongest, the \u201crepro-libertarian\u201d\napproach opposes regulations on reproductive decisions and ART unless\nthey can be shown to threaten harm to others. Repro-libertarianism is\ngrounded in the values of individual equality and autonomy (Feinberg\n1986; Dworkin 1993). The basic thought is that interfering in\nprocreation involves illiberal interference with the person and her\nchoices. Further, some authors hold that ART ought to be universally\navailable provided it does not harm others, because any restrictions\nwould constitute unequal treatment of those who cannot conceive\nthrough sexual intercourse (whether due to infertility or because they\ndo not form a \u201ctraditional\u201d family) (Harris 1998).\n\nRepro-libertarians have been concerned to show that assumptions about\nthe inherent wrongness or harmfulness of ART are not justified. In\nparticular, they have argued that conservative opposition to cloning,\ngenetic selection, surrogacy, and harvesting fetal ovarian tissue is\nbased in undefended traditionalism (Harris 1998; cf. Glover 1998;\nBuchanan et al. 2000, chap. 2).\n",
