    "main_text": "Prehistory of the notion of proof\n1. Prehistory of the notion of proof\n\n\nProof theory can be described as the study of the general structure \nof mathematical proofs, and of arguments with demonstrative force as \nencountered in logic. The idea of such demonstrative arguments, i.e.,\nones the conclusion of which follows necessarily from the assumptions\nmade, is central in Aristotle's Analytica Posteriora: a \ndeductive science is organised around a number of basic concepts that\nare assumed understood without further explanation, and a number of \nbasic truths or axioms that are seen as true immediately. Defined \nconcepts and theorems are reduced to these two, the latter through \nproof. Aristotle's account of proof as demonstrative argument fits \nvery well to the structure of ancient geometry as axiomatized in \nEuclid. The specific form of \n Aristotle's logic,\n the theory of syllogism has instead, so it seems, almost nothing to \ndo with proofs in Euclidean geometry. These proofs remained intuitive\nfor more than two thousand years.\n\n\nBefore the work of Frege in 1879, no one seems to have maintained that\nthere could be a complete set of principles of proof, in the sense\nexpressed by Frege when he wrote that in his symbolic language,\n\n\nall that is necessary for a correct inference is expressed in\nfull, but what is not necessary is generally not indicated; nothing is\nleft to guesswork.\n(Begriffsschrift, p. 3)\n\n (One might contend that Boole is an\nexception as far as classical propositional logic is concerned.)\nFrege's step ahead was decisive for the development of logic and\nfoundational study. The contrast to the ancients is great: Aristotle\ngave a pattern for combining arguments, but the idea of a finite\nclosed set of rules was, philosophically, beyond the dreams of anyone\nbefore Frege, with the possible exception of Leibniz.\n\n\nAs we know today, Frege's principles of proof are complete for \nclassical predicate logic.\n\nAround 1890, Giuseppe Peano gave a formalization of logical inference,\nwith the aim of representing formally proofs in arithmetic. His\nseminal paper Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita,\nwritten originally in Latin, is included in English translation in the\ncollection  From Frege to G\u00f6del (1967) that Jean van Heijenoort\nedited. Unfortunately, the editor failed to recognize what Peano did\nwith formal inference, and the view spread that Peano formalized only\nthe language of logic and arithmetic, not its principles of proof. If\nPeano's proofs are read with even a little care, it transpires that\nthey are purely formal derivations that use two principles:\n\n Axioms imply their instances. Such implications can be written as lines in\nproofs.\n An implication and its antecedent imply together the\nconsequent. \n\nPeano is very careful to list, on every line of his\nderivations, what the formal ground for writing the line is.\n\nRussell\n took up Frege's logic, but used the notation and formal rules of\nproof of Peano, in a paper of 1906 with the title \u201cThe theory of\nimplication.\u201d  Its formal machinery is exactly the same as\nPeano's. In later work, Russell changed the axiomatic system and the\none of Principia Mathematica (Whitehead and Russell 1910\u201313) became\nstandard. Russell's philosophical idea, and here he followed Frege,\nwas that the axioms express basic logical truths, and other logical\ntruths are derived from these through modus ponens and universal\ngeneralization, the two principles Frege had identified. Mathematics\nwas to be reduced to logic, so that its proofs would become presented\nin the same axiomatic pattern.\n\n\nFrege's and Peano-Russell's approach to logic became the universally \naccepted one, especially through the influence of Hilbert and his \nco-workers in the 1920s. In the 19th century, Frege was a marginal \nfigure, and the algebraic approach to logic, as in Boole and \nespecially Ernst Schr\u00f6der, was the dominant one. It is clear \nthat there was a good understanding of the principles of predicate \nlogic in this tradition, for how could there have been a \nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem otherwise? Skolem found out about \nFrege's logic through Principia Mathematica only after having \nworked out the theorem in his paper of 1920. The first section of \nthat paper, widely read because of the English translation in Van \nHeijenoort's From Frege to G\u00f6del, marks the end of the \nalgebraic tradition of logic that merged silently with lattice \ntheory. Other sections of the paper contain a remarkable beginning of\nthe analysis of proofs in lattice theory and in projective geometry: \nSkolem considered the axioms of a mathematical theory from a purely \ncombinatorial and formal point of view, as means for producing \nderivations of a formula from given formulas used as assumptions. It \nwas found out in the early 1990s that the part on lattice theory \ncontains the solution of a decision problem, called the word problem \nfor freely generated lattices, the known solution of which stemmed \nfrom 1988! Skolem's terminology and notation in lattice theory are \nthose of Schr\u00f6der and that is part of the reason why his work \nwas a lost opportunity for proof theory.\n",
