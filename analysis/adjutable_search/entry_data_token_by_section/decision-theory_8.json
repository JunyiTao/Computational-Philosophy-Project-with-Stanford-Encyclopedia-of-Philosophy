    "main_text": "Broader significance of Expected Utility (EU) theory || On rational belief\n4.1 On rational belief\n\nSome refer to EU theory as Bayesian decision theory. This\nlabel brings to the forefront the commitment to probabilism,\ni.e., that beliefs may come in degrees which, on pain of\nirrationality, can be represented numerically as probabilities. So\nthere is a strong connection between EU theory and probabilism, or\nmore generally between rational preference and rational belief. (The\nfiner details of rational preference and associated rational belief\nare not the focus here; challenges to EU theory on this front are\naddressed in\n Section 5\n below.)\n\nSome take the connection between rational preference and rational\nbelief to run very deep indeed. At the far end of the spectrum is the\nposition that the very meaning of belief involves preference. Indeed,\nrecall this manoeuvre in Savage\u2019s theory, discussed earlier in\n Section 3.1.\n Many question the plausibility, however, of equating comparative\nbelief with preferences over specially contrived prospects. A more\nmoderate position is to regard these preferences as entailed by, but\nnot identical with, the relevant comparative beliefs. Whether or not\nbeliefs merely ground or are defined in terms of preference, there is\na further question as to whether the only justification for rational\nbelief having a certain structure (say, conforming to the probability\ncalculus) is a pragmatic one, i.e., an argument resting on the\nagent\u2019s preferences being otherwise inconsistent or\nself-defeating. A recent defender of this kind of pragmatism (albeit\ncast in more general terms) is Rinard (e.g., 2017). Others contend\nthat accounts of rational belief can and should be ultimately\njustified on epistemic grounds; Joyce (1998), for instance, offers a\nnon-pragmatic justification of probabilism that rests on the notion of\noverall \u201cdistance from the truth\u201d of one\u2019s beliefs.\n(For further developments of this position, see the entry on\n epistemic utility arguments for probabilism.)\n\nNotwithstanding these finer disputes, Bayesians agree that pragmatic\nconsiderations play a significant role in managing beliefs. One\nimportant way, at least, in which an agent can interrogate her degrees\nof belief is to reflect on their pragmatic implications. Furthermore,\nwhether or not to seek more evidence is a pragmatic issue; it depends\non the \u201cvalue of information\u201d one expects to gain with\nrespect to the decision problem at hand. The idea is that seeking more\nevidence is an action that is choice-worthy just in case the expected\nutility of seeking further evidence before making one\u2019s decision\nis greater than the expected utility of making the decision on the\nbasis of existing evidence. This reasoning was made prominent in a\npaper by Good (1967), where he proves that one should always seek\n\u201cfree evidence\u201d that may have a bearing on the decision at\nhand. (Precursors of this theorem can be found in Ramsey 1990,\npublished posthumously, and Savage 1954.) Note that the theorem\nassumes the standard Bayesian learning rule known as\n\u201cconditionalisation\u201d, which requires that when one\u2019s\nlearning experience has the form of coming to know some proposition\n(to which one had assigned positive probability) for sure, one\u2019s\nnew degrees of belief should be equal to one\u2019s old degrees of\nbelief conditional on the proposition that now has probability one.\nIndeed, the fact that conditionalisation plays a crucial role in\nGood\u2019s result about the non-negative value of free evidence is\ntaken by some as providing some justification for this learning\nrule.\n\nSo EU theory or Bayesian decision theory underpins a powerful set of\nepistemic norms. It has been taken as the appropriate account of\nscientific inference, giving rise to a school of statistical inference\nand experimental design and inviting formal interpretations of key\nconcepts like \u201cevidence\u201d, \u201cevidential\nsupport\u201d, \u201cinduction\u201d versus\n\u201cabduction\u201d, and the bearing of \u201ccoherence\u201d\nand \u201cexplanatory power\u201d on truth (see the relevant\n related entries).\n The major competitor to Bayesianism, as regards scientific inference,\nis arguably the collection of approaches known as Classical or Error\nstatistics, which deny the sense of \u201cdegrees of support\u201d\n(probabilistic or otherwise) conferred on a hypothesis by evidence.\nThese approaches focus instead on whether a hypothesis has survived\nvarious \u201csevere tests\u201d, and inferences are made with an\neye to the long-run properties of tests as opposed to how they perform\nin any single case, which would require decision-theoretic reasoning\n(see the entry on\n philosophy of statistics).\n",
