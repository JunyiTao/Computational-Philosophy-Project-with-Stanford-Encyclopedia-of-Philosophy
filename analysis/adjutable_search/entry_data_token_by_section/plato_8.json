Does Plato change his mind about forms?\n\nThis way of reading Plato\u2019s dialogues does not presuppose that\nhe never changes his mind about anything\u2014that whatever any of\nhis main interlocutors uphold in one dialogue will continue to be\npresupposed or affirmed elsewhere without alteration. It is, in fact,\na difficult and delicate matter to determine, on the basis of our\nreading of the dialogues, whether Plato means to modify or reject in\none dialogue what he has his main interlocutor affirm in some other.\nOne of the most intriguing and controversial questions about his\ntreatment of the forms, for example, is whether he concedes that his\nconception of those abstract entities is vulnerable to criticism; and,\nif so, whether he revises some of the assumptions he had been making\nabout them, or develops a more elaborate picture of them that allows\nhim to respond to that criticism (see Meinwald 2016). In\nParmenides, the principal interlocutor (not Socrates\u2014he\nis here portrayed as a promising, young philosopher in need of further\ntraining\u2014but rather the pre-Socratic from Elea who gives the\ndialogue its name: Parmenides) subjects the forms to withering\ncriticism, and then consents to conduct an inquiry into the nature of\noneness that has no overt connection to his critique of the forms.\nDoes the discussion of oneness (a baffling series of\ncontradictions\u2014or at any rate, propositions that seem, on the\nsurface, to be contradictions) in some way help address the problems\nraised about forms? That is one way of reading the dialogue. And if we\ndo read it in this way, does that show that Plato has changed his mind\nabout some of the ideas about forms he inserted into earlier\ndialogues? Can we find dialogues in which we encounter a \u201cnew\ntheory of forms\u201d\u2014that is, a way of thinking of forms that\ncarefully steers clear of the assumptions about forms that led to\nParmenides\u2019 critique? It is not easy to say. But we cannot even\nraise this as an issue worth pondering unless we presuppose that\nbehind the dialogues there stands a single mind that is using these\nwritings as a way of hitting upon the truth, and of bringing that\ntruth to the attention of others. If we find Timaeus (the principal\ninterlocutor of the dialogue named after him) and the Eleatic visitor\nof the Sophist and Statesman talking about forms in\na way that is entirely consistent with the way Socrates talks about\nforms in Phaedo and Republic, then there is only one\nreasonable explanation for that consistency: Plato believes that their\nway of talking about forms is correct, or is at least strongly\nsupported by powerful considerations. If, on the other hand, we find\nthat Timaeus or the Eleatic visitor talks about forms in a way that\ndoes not harmonize with the way Socrates conceives of those abstract\nobjects, in the dialogues that assign him a central role as director\nof the conversation, then the most plausible explanation for these\ndiscrepancies is that Plato has changed his mind about the nature of\nthese entities. It would be implausible to suppose that Plato himself\nhad no convictions about forms, and merely wants to give his readers\nmental exercise by composing dialogues in which different leading\ncharacters talk about these objects in discordant ways.\n",
