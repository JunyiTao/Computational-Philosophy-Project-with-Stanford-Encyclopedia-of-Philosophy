    "main_text": "Life and Works || Life\n1.1 Life\n\nLittle is known about Iamblichus\u2019 life and career, since\nEunapius of Sardis\u2019 biography of Iamblichus (Lives of\nPhilosophers and Sophists V [Goulet 2014, Baltussen 2023])\nis merely hagiographical in nature. His birthplace is traditionally\ntaken to be Chalcis ad Belum (modern Qinnasrin), although support has\nbeen voiced in favor of a different Chalcis, Chalcis sub Libanum\n(Aliquot 2010: 307 and n. 7). What is uncontroversial is that\nIamblichus hailed from a very influential Syrian family, the\nSampsigeramids of Emesa (Damascius, Philosophical History,\nAthanassiadi 1999: 334.10\u201314 [Zintzen 1967: 2.8\u201310]), who\nhad gained access to the Imperial throne along with Elagabalus\n(218\u2013222).\n\nEunapius gives Anatolius and then Porphyry as Iamblichus\u2019 two\nteachers, and there are no decisive reasons to doubt this: on the one\nhand, it is evident that he was influenced by the kind of theological\narithmology Anatolius championed; on the other hand, Porphyry\ndedicated his treatise On the \u201cKnow thyself\u201d to\nIamblichus (Stobaeus, Anthology III, 21, 26) and provides\ninformation about the philosopher\u2019s son (Life of\nPlotinus 9). Since this son is said by Porphyry to have married a\nRoman aristocrat, it is very likely that Iamblichus studied in Rome\nunder Porphyry, who would have carried on the philosophical circle\nPlotinus had founded in 244. Dalsgaard Larsen\u2019s (DL-1972: I,\n38\u201339) supposition of a prolonged stay at Alexandria is dubious\nat best.\n\nAfter a break with Porphyry that seems impossible to date with\nprecision, Iamblichus settled in Syria. Although he is known to have\nowned an estate in Antioch\u2019s suburb of Daphne, it is now\naccepted that he settled in Apamea, where Plotinus\u2019 first\ndisciple Amelius had previously moved. There, welcomed by a wealthy\nnotable, Sopater, he founded a flourishing school: we know about a\ndozen of his students (see below,\n Section 2.4),\n among whom the most conspicuous are Sopater himself, who died because\nof a plot at Constantine\u2019s court; Aedesius, who moved the school\nto Pergamon; and Dexippus, the only disciple of whom we still have a\nphilosophical work (a commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories). Apart from Eunapius, evidence about\nIamblichus\u2019 whereabouts in Apamea is to be found mainly in\nLibanius (e.g. Ep. 1389.13\u201314) and, above all, in the\nletters by an anonymous Syrian sophist whose correspondence with\nIamblichus was preserved among the genuine letters of the emperor\nJulian (e.g. Pseudo-Julian, Ep. 78 and 79 Wright).\n",
