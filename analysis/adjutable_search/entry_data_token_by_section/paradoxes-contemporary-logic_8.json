    "main_text": "Paradoxes, predicativism and the doctrine of types: 1905\u20131913 || Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types\n3.2 Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types\n\nThe Russellian theory of types is widely known and investigated in the\nliterature (see the entries on\n type theory\n and\n Bertrand Russell):\n it is of current interest and has descendants in logic and its\napplications. It was first developed by Russell in the fundamental\nmemoir Mathematical Logic as based on the theory of types of\n1908.\n\nThe doctrine of types is based upon the observation that universal\nquantification\u2014understood as full generality, i.e., when \\(x\\)\nranges \u2018over the whole universe\u2019\u2014does not make\nsense: when we state that \\(\\forall x\\phi(x)\\) is true, we only claim\nthe function \\(\\phi(x)\\) has the value \u2018true\u2019 for all\narguments \\(x\\) for which it is meaningful. The essential\npoint is that each propositional function has a range of significance,\ni.e., a type, and quantification is legitimate only over\ntypes. Formally speaking, each variable must have a preassigned\ntype. The paradoxes (or reflexive fallacies) prove that certain\ncollections, such as the totality of all propositions, of all classes\nand so on, cannot be types. So we can quantify over the collection of\nmen, but we cannot properly state \u2018all propositions of the form\n\\(p\\vee \\neg p\\) are true\u2019. Therefore, the logical entities\ndivide into types, and, in particular, every propositional\nfunction must have a higher type than its arguments. Moreover, in\nthe light of the vicious circle principle, the notion of\norder must also be introduced. No object can be defined by\nquantifying over a totality which contains the object itself as\nelement; hence the order of every propositional function must be\ngreater than the order of propositional functions over which it\nquantifies.\n\nThe main idea is clarified in Russell 1908 (pp. 163\u2013164) by\nconsidering how propositions can be arranged into a suitable\n\u201cramified\u201d hierarchy, according to their order and so as\nto satisfy the vicious circle principle. First of all, there are\nelementary propositions, i.e., those containing no bound variables at\nall, while the lowest type consists of individuals.\nIndividuals are entities without logical structure and can be regarded\nas the subjects of elementary propositions. The second logical type\nembraces the first order propositions, i.e., those whose\nquantifiers (if any) range only over individuals. Quantification over\nfirst order propositions gives rise to a new type, consisting exactly\nof second order propositions. In general, the \\((n + 1)\\)th\nlogical type comprises propositions of order \\(n\\), which contain\nquantification only up to the \\((n - 1)\\)th order.\n\nSince a propositional function can be obtained from a proposition\n\u2018by treating one or more of its constituents as\nvariables\u2019, the hierarchy of types and orders is naturally\nlifted to propositional functions, and it makes sense to speak of\norder of a function, its order being roughly the order of the\nvalue (i.e., a proposition) which the function assumes when it is\napplied to an argument for which it makes sense. So, for instance, a\nfunction which applies to individuals and takes first-order\npropositions as values is first-order.\n\nFollowing the doctrine of types, we must replace \u2018all\npropositions\u2019 by \u2018all propositions of order \\(n\\)\u2019\nfor a given \\(n\\). Hence the Liar sentence becomes \u201cit is not\ntrue of all propositions \\(p\\) of order \\(n\\), that if I affirm \\(p,\np\\) is true\u201d, which is a proposition of order \\(n + 1\\). Then\nthe Liar is simply false rather than contradictory; and this solves\nthe paradox. Similar arguments solve the other paradoxes.\n\nIn this theory, predicative functions of one argument, i.e.,\nthose having as order the successor of the order of their argument,\nplay a crucial role. For instance, a predicative function of an\nindividual variable must have order 1 (in current terminology, it is\nelementarily definable and quantifies only over individuals).\nThe axiom of reducibility (AR) states that every\npropositional function is equivalent, for all its values, to a\npredicative function of the same variables. So, for instance, we\nmight have a definition of a property \\(P(n)\\) of natural numbers\n(regarded as individuals) which quantifies over, say, second-order\npropositions. But AR implies that there exists a function \\(P^* (n)\\)\nwhich is satisfied by exactly the same numbers as \\(P(n)\\) and is\npredicative, i.e., it involves quantification only on\nnumbers.\n\nThus, according to the axiom of reducibility, statements about\narbitrary functions can be replaced by statements about predicative\nfunctions; and predicative functions play the role of classes, i.e.,\ncanonical representatives of arbitrary complex concepts (e.g., among\nthe possible properties of different order which have the same\nextension as \\(P(n)\\), \\(P^*(n)\\) canonically represents the class of\nnumbers satisfying \\(P(n))\\).\n\nBesides the axiom of infinity, AR is an essential tool for\nreconstructing classical mathematics, but it is a strong existential\nprinciple, apparently in conflict with the philosophical idea that\nlogical and mathematical entities are to be constructively generated\naccording to the vicious circle principle. Nonetheless, it was adopted\nin the (first edition of the) monumental Principia\nMathematica, written in collaboration with A.N. Whitehead and\npublished in 1910 (vol. 1), 1912 (vol. 2) and 1913 (vol. 3).\n\nInterestingly, the basic idea underlying Russell\u2019s ramified\nhierarchy of types is a crucial ingredient in G\u00f6del\u2019s later\nconsistency proof of the continuum hypothesis via its inner model\n\\(L\\) of constructible sets. Also, as already observed in G\u00f6del\n(1944), a form of AR becomes true in \\(L\\) in the sense that, roughly,\nan arbitrary propositional function of natural numbers is\nextensionally equivalent to some function of order \\(\\alpha\\), for\nsome countable ordinal \\(\\alpha\\) (see the entry\n Kurt G\u00f6del).\n Other important applications of ramified hierarchies have been given\nsince the late fifties in different fields (from recursion theory to\nproof theory; see the entry on\n type theory).\n",
