    "main_text": "Strong Substantive and Socio-relational Conceptions\n9. Conclusion\n\nFeminist theories of autonomy analyze the effects of internalized\noppression and the circumstances of oppression on agents\u2019 global\nand local autonomy. There is no consensus as to which theoretical\nposition is correct. To some extent, the answer depends on intuitions\nabout which view best captures the notion of agency that is\none\u2019s own. There is considerable consensus, however,\nthat oppressive socialization and oppressive practices diminish\nautonomy and perhaps undermine it altogether. The relational\nconceptions of autonomy surveyed here are important contributions to\ntheoretical debates on the nature of autonomy as well as to our\nunderstanding of how oppression interferes with the psychological\nstates and social conditions required for autonomy.\n",
