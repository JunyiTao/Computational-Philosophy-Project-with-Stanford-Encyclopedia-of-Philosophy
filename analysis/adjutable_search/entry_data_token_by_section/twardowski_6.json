This included developing a\ntheory of concepts and a theory of judgment.\n\nIn Content and Object, Twardowski had given a coherent account\nof how judgments such as \u2018The aether does not exist\u2019 work\non the basis of the systematization of the notion of \u2018object of\na presentation.\u2019 That systematization however had implications\nfor the theory of judgment which went far beyond the account of\njudgments such as \u2018The aether does not exist.\u2019 Although\nContent and Object contains little on the theory of judgment,\nTwardowski was well aware of those implications. A letter to Meinong\nis evidence that Twardowski was developing a theory of judgment which\ncontinued the work initiated by Content and Object, whose first\nmain outline can be found in Twardowski's manuscripts Logik\n1894/5 and Logika 1895/6 (Betti & van der Schaar 2004,\nBetti 2005).\n\nIn his \u2018Self-Portrait\u2019 Twardowski also remarks that it was\nthe question of the nature of concepts that brought him to Content\nand Object. The issue ensued from Twardowski's research on a\nparticular concept in his doctoral dissertation, Descartes' concept of\nclear and distinct perception. Since concepts are a species of\npresentations, Twardowski saw that he had first to investigate\npresentations in general, and thus to dispel the ambiguities that the\nnotion of \u2018the presented\u2019 carried with itself (Twardowski\n1926, 10). Work on concepts is to be found in the manuscript Logik\n1894/5, where concepts are defined as presentations with\nwell-defined content, in Images and Concepts (1898) and in\nThe Essence of Concepts (1924), where presentations with\nwell-defined content (i.e. fixed by a definition) are called\n\u2018logical concepts.\u2019 An important role in Twardowski's\ntheory of concepts and definitions is played by the notion of\npresented judgment, i.e. judgments not really passed, but merely\npresented (in the modified sense). Twardowski's investigation of the\nnotion of (logical) concept is important to understand his attitude\ntowards objectivity and unicity of meaning, i.e. his relationship to\npsychologism on the one hand, and the role of the theorizations in\nContent and Object of two notions: that of the object of a\ngeneral presentation (which disappears for instance in Logik\n1894/5) and that of indirect presentations on the other hand.\n",
