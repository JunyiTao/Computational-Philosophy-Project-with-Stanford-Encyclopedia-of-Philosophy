    "main_text": "Applications || Artificial Intelligence\n4.8 Artificial Intelligence\n\nSince its inception, the field of automated theorem proving has had\nimportant applications in the larger field of artificial intelligence\n(AI). Automated deduction is at the heart of AI applications like\nlogic programming (see section 4.1 Logic Programming, in this\narticle) where computation is equated with deduction; robotics and\nproblem solving (Green 1969) where the steps to achieve goals are\nsteps extracted from proofs; deductive databases (Minker et\nal. 2014) where factual knowledge is expressed as atomic clauses\nand inference rules, and new facts are inferred by deduction; expert\nsystems (Giarratano & Riley 2004) where human expertise in a given\ndomain (e.g. blood infections) is captured as a collection of IF-THEN\ndeduction rules and where conclusions (e.g. diagnoses) are obtained by\nthe application of the inference rules; and many others. An\napplication of automated reasoning in AI which is bound to have deep\nphilosophical implications is the increased use of BDI computational\nlogics for describing the beliefs, desires, and intentions of\nintelligent agents and multi-agent systems (Meyer 2014) and, in\nparticular, endowing future intelligent systems, such as\ndecision-support systems or robots, with legal and ethical behaviour.\nDeontic logic can be automated for the task (Furbach et al.\n2014) but given that there is no agreement on a universal system of\ndeontic logic, ethics \u201ccode designers\u201d need a way to\nexperiment with the different deontic systems (i.e., to lay out axioms\nand see what conclusions follow from them) to help them identify the\ndesired ethic code for the specific application at hand;\n(Benzm\u00fcller et al. 2018) discusses an environment for this. If\nactual, physical, robots were to be used in these experiments, the\nterm \u201cdeontic laboratory\u201d would be quite descriptive\nalbeit somewhat eerie.\n\nRestricting the proof search space has always been a key consideration\nin the implementation of automated deduction, and traditional\nAI-approaches to search have been an integral part of theorem provers.\nThe main idea is to prevent the prover from pursuing unfruitful\nreasoning paths. A dual aspect of search is to try to look for a\npreviously proved result that could be useful in the completion of the\ncurrent proof. Automatically identifying those results is no easy task\nand it becomes less easy as the size of the problem domain, and the\nnumber of already established results, grows. This is not a happy\nsituation particularly in light of the growing trend to build large\nlibraries of theorems such as the Mizar Problems for Theorem Proving\n(MPTP) (Urban et al. 2010, Bancerek & Rudnicki 2003) or the\nIsabelle/HOL mathematical library (Meng & Paulson 2008), so\ndeveloping techniques for the discovery, evaluation, and selection of\nexisting suitable definitions, premises and lemmas in large libraries\nof formal mathematics as discussed in (K\u00fchlwein et al.\n2012) is an important line of research. \n\nAmong many other methods, and in stark contrast to automated provers,\nmathematicians combine induction heuristics with deductive techniques\nwhen attacking a problem. The former helps them guide the\nproof-finding effort while the latter allows them to close proof gaps.\nAnd of course all this happens in the presence of the very large body\nof knowledge that the human possesses. For an automated prover, the\nanalogous counterpart to the mathematician\u2019s body of knowledge is a\nlarge library like MPTP. An analogous approach to using inductive\nheuristics would be to endow the theorem prover with inductive,\ndata-driven, machine learning abilities. Urban & Vyskocil 2012\nrun a number of experiments to determine any gains that may result\nfrom such an approach. For this, they use MPTP and theorem provers\nlike E and SPASS enhanced with symbol-based machine learning\nmechanisms. A detailed presentation and statistical results can be\nfound in the above reference but in summary, and quoting the authors,\n\u201cthis experiment demonstrates a very real and quite unique\nbenefit of large formal mathematical libraries for conducting novel\nintegration of AI methods. As the machine learner is trained on\nprevious proofs, it recommends relevant premises from the large\nlibrary that (according to the past experience) should be useful for\nproving new conjectures.\u201d Urban 2007 discusses MaLARea (a\nMachine Learner for Automated Reasoning), a meta-system that also\ncombines inductive and deductive reasoning methods. MaLARea is\nintended to be used in large theories, i.e. problems with a large\nnumber of symbols, definitions, premises, lemmas, and theorems. The\nsystem works in cycles where results proved deductively in a given\niteration are then used by the inductive machine-learning component to\nplace restrictions in the search space for the next theorem-proving\ncycle. Albeit simple in design, the first version of MaLARea solved\n142 problems out of 252 in the MPTP Challenge, outperforming the more\nseasoned provers E (89 problems solved) and SPASS (81 problems\nsolved).\n\nBesides using large mathematical libraries, tapping into web-based\nsemantic ontologies is another possible source of knowledge. Pease\n& Sutcliffe 2007 discuss ways for making the SUMO ontology\nsuitable for first-order theorem proving, and describes work on\ntranslating SUMO into TPTP. An added benefit of successfully reasoning\nover large semantic ontologies is that this promotes the application\nof automated reasoning into other fields of science. Tapping into its\nfull potential, however, will require a closer alignment of methods\nfrom automated reasoning and artificial intelligence.\n",
