    "main_text": "Modeling Agreement || Aggregation\n3.3 Aggregation\n\nWe can distinguish bargaining from aggregation models of agreement.\nRather than seeking an outcome that (as, roughly, the\nKalai-Smorodinsky solution does) splits the difference between various\nclaims, we might seek to aggregate the individual rankings into an\noverall social choice. Arrow\u2019s theorem and related problems with\nsocial choice rules casts doubt on any claim that one specific way of\naggregating is uniquely rational: all have their shortcomings (Gaus\nand Thrasher 2021, chap. 8). Harsanyi (1977, chaps. 1 and 2; 1982)\ndevelops a contractual theory much like Rawls\u2019s using this\napproach. In Harsanyi\u2019s approach, reasoning behind a veil of\nignorance in which people do not know their post-contract identities,\nhe supposes that rational contractors will assume it is equally\nprobable that they will be any specific person. Moreover, he argues\nthat contractors can agree on interpersonal utility comparisons, and\nso they will opt for a contract that aggregates utility at the highest\naverage (see also Mueller 2003, chap. 26). This, of course, depends on\nthe supposition that there is a non-controversial metric that allows\nus to aggregate the parties\u2019 utility functions. Binmore (2005)\nfollows Harsanyi and Amartya Sen (2009, Chap. 13) in arguing that\ninterpersonal comparisons can be made for the purposes of aggregation,\nat least some of the time. John Broome (1995) develops something like\nHarsanyi\u2019s approach that relies on making interpersonal\ncomparisons.\n\nOne of the problems with this approach, however, is that if the\ninterpersonal comparisons are incomplete they will not be able to\nproduce a complete social ordering. As Sen points out, this will lead\nto a maximal set of alternatives where no alternative is dominated by\nany other within the set but also where no particular alternative is\noptimal (Sen, 1997). Instead of solving the aggregation problem, then,\ninterpersonal comparisons may only be able to reduce the set of\nalternatives without being able to complete the ordering of\nalternatives.\n\nBecause of the problems with indeterminacy, many theorists have\nrejected the aggregation approach as being either unworkable or as\nbeing incomplete in some way. Gaus (2011), for instance, uses an\nevolutionary mechanism to generate determinacy in his aggregation\nmodel. Brian Kogelmann (2017) argues, however, that under reasonable\nassumptions about the preferences of the representative agents,\naggregation alone is sufficient to generate determinacy.\n",
