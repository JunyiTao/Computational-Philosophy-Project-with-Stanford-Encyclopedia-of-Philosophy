    "main_text": "\n\nHealth and disease are critical concepts in bioethics with\nfar-reaching social and political implications. For instance, any\nattempt to educate physicians or regulate heath insurance must employ\nsome standards that can be used to assess whether people are ill or\nnot. Concepts of health and disease also connect in interesting ways\nwith issues about function and explanation in philosophy of the\nbiomedical sciences, and theories of well-being in ethics.\n",
