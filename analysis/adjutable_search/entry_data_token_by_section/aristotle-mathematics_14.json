    "main_text": "Unit (monas) and Number (arithmos) || Time\n10.3 Time\n\n\nAristotle's treatment of time (Physics iv.10-14) includes some\nobservations about numbers which come closest to being an account of\nnumber. Aristotle defines time as the number or count of change and\nthen proceeds to distinguish two senses of number, what is counted\n(e.g., ten cows as measured by the cow-unit, or ten feet as measured by\nthe foot-unit) and that by which we count. Time is number in the first\nsense, not as so-many changes, but as so-much change as measured by a\nunit of change. Aristotle clarifies the distinction between what is\ncounted (or is countable) and that by which we count. These five black\ncats (number as what is counted) are different from these five brown\ncats, but their number (that by which we count) is the same. \n\n\n\nBut what are the numbers by which we count? Aristotle says nothing, but\nwe may speculate that the five by which we count is the single formal\nexplanation of what makes the five black cats five and what makes the\nfive brown cats five. Hence, Aristotle probably subscribes to an\nAristotelian version of the distinction between intermediate and\nForm-numbers. \n\n\nAristotle's discussion of time also gives us some insight into the\nunity problem. What gives the five black cats unity is just that they\ncan be treated as a unity. From this it follows for Aristotle that\nthere can be no number without mind. Nothing is countable unless there\nexists a counter.\n",
