    "main_text": "Applied Questions in Immigration || Refugees\n3.1 Refugees\n\n\nThe 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees defines a\nrefugee as someone who \u201cowing to a well-founded fear of being\npersecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a\nparticular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country\nof his nationality, and is unable to or, owing to such fear, is\nunwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\u201d\n(Article 1A[2]) Critics like Andrew Shacknove (1985) have\nquestioned this definition on at least three grounds. First, why\nfocus exclusively on victims of group-based persecution? And even\nif we do think in terms of groups, why restrict ourselves to these\nparticular groups? What if someone is persecuted qua\nwoman or qua homosexual, for instance? Second, given the\nvariety of threats to living a minimally decent human life, why insist\nthat only those vulnerable to persecution can qualify as\nrefugees? What about so-called \u201ceconomic refugees\u201d or\npeople fleeing a civil war, for instance? Third, why stipulate\nthat someone who is not \u201coutside the country of his\nnationality\u201d cannot be a refugee? What if an individual is\nbeing detained at the border or simply lacks the means to migrate\nwithout assistance, for example?\n\n\nShacknove speculates that this narrow understanding of refugees is\nlikely the consequence of real-world political pressures from leaders\nwho are wary of the international legal obligations that would follow\nfrom a more expansive definition. As he puts it,\n\u201c\u2026states reason in reverse from their fear that they will\nbe forced to shoulder the burden of assisting refugees unilaterally to\na narrow conception of refugeehood which limits the number of\nclaimants.\u201d (Shacknove 1985: 277) Whether one accepts the\ninternational legal definition or lobbies on behalf of a more expansive\nconception, however, there is broad-based support for the view that\nrefugees constitute a special category of potential immigrants who\npossess particularly urgent claims to admittance. Thus, while\ntheorists may vehemently disagree as to whether a country has a right\nto design and enforce its own immigration policies, even those who\naffirm a state\u2019s general right to exclude foreigners typically\nmake an exception in the case of refugees. It is one thing for\nthe United States to refuse to admit a Russian ballerina who would like\nto study and perform in New York, for instance, but is another thing\naltogether for it to turn away a political dissident who rightly fears\npersecution by the oppressive regime in her home state. In the\nlatter case, the dire nature of the refugee\u2019s circumstances are\nthought to give her a pressing claim which trumps whatever presumptive\nright a state generally has to reject hopeful immigrants. More\nrecently, however, some have come to question this line of\nthinking. Few suggest that a state has no duties to imperiled\nforeigners, but theorists increasingly question whether a state\u2019s\nduty to assist refugees must come in the form of admitting them.\nConsider the Kurds in Northern Iraq, for instance. Given the\nabuses they suffered under Saddam Hussein\u2019s rule, many would\nargue they should have qualified as refugees. One way to offer\nassistance would have been to provide them refuge in various foreign\ncountries. But as history shows, this was not the only way to\nhelp. Another option was to protect the Kurds where they lived,\nby securing a safe-haven fortified by a no-fly zone in Northern\nIraq. (A third possible option might be for rich countries to pay\npoorer countries to admit the refugees.) Of course, for a variety\nof reasons, countries might prefer not to intervene in the affairs of a\nforeign state, but the important point is the more general lesson that,\neven if we take for granted that stable, wealthy countries can have\nstringent duties to refugees, it does not follow that these duties must\nbe paid in the currency of open borders.\n",
