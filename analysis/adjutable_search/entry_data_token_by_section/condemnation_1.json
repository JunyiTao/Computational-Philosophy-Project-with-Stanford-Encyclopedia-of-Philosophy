    "main_text": "The juridical context of Tempier\u2019s condemnation\n2. The juridical context of Tempier\u2019s condemnation\n\nTempier\u2019s condemnation is only one of the approximately sixteen\nlists of censured theses that were issued at the University of Paris\nduring the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Most of these lists of\npropositions were put together into systematic collections of\nprohibited articles. One of the earliest of these collections of\nmedieval condemned articles originated towards the end of the\nthirteenth century under the name of Parisian Articles or also\nCollectio errorum in anglia et parisius condempnatorum.\nInitially this collection consisted of twenty-two chapters presenting\nthe errors condemned in 1277 by Archbishop Robert Kilwardby at Oxford,\nin 1241 by Bishop William of Alvernia in Paris, and in 1270 and 1277\nby Bishop Stephen Tempier in Paris (in this order).\n\nDuring the fourteenth century, this Collection grew significantly, so\nthat, in fact, a second, augmented Collection came into existence. All\nthe propositions that were added to the first compilation had been\ncondemned in the fourteenth century at the University of Paris. It can\nbe seen as a collection of verdicts, which at the opening of each new\nset of verdicts provides information about the parties involved and\nthe date. The verdicts are not motivated, nor does the collection\nprovide an account of the events (narratio).\n\nThe collection of Parisian Articles must have had some kind of\nofficial status, and must have circulated among medieval scholars.\nBachelors in theology were required by oath not to maintain anything\n\u201cin favor of articles that have been condemned at the Roman\ncuria or in Paris.\u201d Moreover, many medieval philosophical and\ntheological texts contain references to and quotations from the\n\u201cParisian articles,\u201d which by no means should always be\nidentified with Tempier\u2019s list of condemned articles.\n\nIf one compares Tempier\u2019s 1277 syllabus to the other lists of\nerrors assembled in the compilation of Parisian Articles two features\nstand out, namely the anonymity of its targets and its promulgation by\na bishop. Tempier does not specify the persons behind the false views,\nbut merely states that the errors were disseminated by \u201ccertain\nscholars at the faculty of arts.\u201d The other condemnations,\nhowever, all concern specific scholars whose names are explicitly\nmentioned in the Collectio errorum. In addition, it is one of\nthe few censures in which a bishop was involved right from the start,\nand not, for instance, at a later stage of the proceedings as judge of\nan appeal.\n\nIn his introductory letter to the syllabus of errors, Tempier\nindicates that he responded to information received from important\npeople (magnarum et gravium personarum crebra zeloque fidei\naccensa insinuavit relatio). The allegations were that\n\u201csome scholars of arts at Paris\u201d (nonnulli Parisius\nstudentes in artibus) had been transgressing the limits of their\nown faculty (proprie facultatis limites excedentes). In all\nlikelihood, this complaint stemmed from theological circles.\n\nIn his introductory letter, Tempier also reports that he sought the\nadvice \u201cnot only of the doctors of Sacred Scripture, but also of\nother wise men\u201d (tam doctorum sacrae Scripturae, quam\naliorum prudentium virorum communicato consilio). From other\ncases of suspect teaching we know that the task of the theologians was\nto examine certain works and draw up a list of errors. In cases where\na list of alleged errors already existed, the theologians were charged\nwith assessing the degree of error of the listed propositions. The\ntheologian John of Pouilly reports that sixteen masters of theology\nwere Tempier\u2019s assessors for the condemnation. One of the\nmembers of the commission was Henry of Ghent, as he himself testifies\nin his Quodlibet II. It is unknown when these masters met,\nbut it must have been after Henry of Ghent had become a regent master\nin theology, a position that he obtained in 1276. That there were some\ntensions between Tempier and the theologians is attested by Giles of\nRome, a contemporary witness of the events of 1277: he claimed that\nsome articles were condemned not on the basis of the advice of the\nmasters, but rather due to the \u201cobstinacy of a few.\u201d This\nobservation has been taken to concern Tempier, but it might also have\nincluded some of the \u201cwise men\u201d who had assisted him.\n\nThe identity of these other wise men is unknown. Since, however, they\nare so clearly distinguished from the theologians, they have to be\nsought among the prelates. Of these, only the involvement of the\nchancellor, John of Alleux, is directly substantiated by the textual\nevidence: the introductory letter to Tempier\u2019s condemnation\nstipulated that offenders had to report either to the bishop himself\nor to the chancellor. Other likely candidates are Simon of Brion, the\npapal legate, and Ranulph of Houblonnire, Tempier\u2019s future\nsuccessor as bishop of Paris.\n\nIn addition, mention should be made of the possible role of the\ninquisitor of France, Simon du Val. On November 23, 1276 he had\nsummoned three ex-scholars from Paris, now residing in Li\u00e8ge,\nto appear before his court \u201cprobably and gravely suspect of the\ncrime of heresy\u201d (de crimine heresis probabiliter et\nvehementer suspectos). They were Siger of Brabant, canon at Saint\nPaul\u2019s, and Goswin of Chapelle and Bernier of Nivelles, canons\nat Saint Martin\u2019s, all in Li\u00e8ge. At least one of them,\nSiger of Brabant, was also implicated in Tempier\u2019s condemnation\n(see below). Although there is no firm textual evidence, it is\ntempting to speculate that the inquisitor\u2019s dossier concerning\nthese three arts masters was known to Bishop Tempier.\n",
