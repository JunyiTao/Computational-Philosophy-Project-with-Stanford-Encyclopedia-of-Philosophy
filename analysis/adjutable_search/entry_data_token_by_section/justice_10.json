    "main_text": "The Scope of Justice\n3. The Scope of Justice\n\nWhen we raise questions about the scope of justice, we are asking\nabout when principles of justice take effect and among\nwhom. We have already, when discussing Hume, encountered the idea\nthat there might be circumstances in which justice becomes irrelevant\n\u2013 circumstances in which resources are so abundant that it is\npointless to allocate individual shares, or, as Hume also believed, in\nwhich resources are so scarce that everyone is permitted to grab what\nhe can in the name of self-preservation. But even in circumstances\nthat are less extreme than these, questions about scope arise. Who can\nmake claims of justice, and who might have the corresponding\nobligation to meet them? Does this depend on the kind of thing that is\nbeing claimed? If comparative principles are being applied, who should\nbe counted as part of the comparison group? Do some principles of\njustice have universal scope \u2013 they apply whenever agent\nA acts towards recipient B, regardless of the\nrelationship between them \u2013 while others are contextual in\ncharacter, applying only within social or political relationships of a\ncertain kind? The present section examines some of these questions in\ngreater detail.\n",
