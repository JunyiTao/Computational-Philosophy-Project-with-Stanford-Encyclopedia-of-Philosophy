    "main_text": "Major Works || The Inhuman and the Event\n3.4 The Inhuman and the Event\n\nReturning to themes in The Postmodern Condition, 1988\u2019s\nThe Inhuman returns to the problems of consumer capitalism.\nThis set of essays, most first given as lectures, are remarkable in\ntheir literary and philosophical quality, with each indirectly, as the\nsubtitle suggests, taking up the problem of temporality, that is, our\nopenness to the unphraseable events given in a future worthy of the\nname. Like other French thinkers of his day, Lyotard was a\nthoroughgoing critic of humanism and its pretension to define and thus\nlimit what the human was to be. The Inhuman begins by\ndissociating two forms that the \u201cinhuman\u201d has taken in\npostmodernity: on the one hand, there is the dehumanizing inhumanism\nof contemporary capitalism and its reduction of the human to modes of\nefficiency and the needs of the technocratic order, specifically\nthrough the ideology of \u201cdevelopment\u201d. Under this rubric,\nwhat is dubbed the human is constrained to become more like machines\nin their functioning, or indeed that the machines we have built will\nreplace us in terms of the thinking we thought integral to the human\nbeing. The opening essay, \u201cCan Thought Go on without a\nBody?\u201d takes this up as the ultimate dream of technoscience,\narguing, in a dialogue between a \u201che\u201d and a\n\u201cshe\u201d, that \u201cthe sole serious question to face\nhumanity today\u201d is the fact that in 4.5 billion years, the sun\nwill burn out and take all of human thought, including the entire\narchive that human beings ever existed, with it (Inhuman, 9).\nTechno-science, the \u201che\u201d claims, has its telos in escaping\nthis fate, which \u201che\u201d calls a \u201cpure event\u201d,\none that, in the terms of The Differend, could never be put\ninto a phrase since no one would be there to think it. \u201cAll the\nevents and disasters we\u2019re familiar with and try to think\nof\u201d, \u201che\u201d writes, \u201cwill end up as no more than\npale simulacra\u201d (Inhuman, 11). While hyperbolic,\nLyotard\u2019s surmise is that technoscience is driven by a need to\nconquer our being-towards-death and indeed, the possibility of the\nultimate finitude of any living-on of any memory or history of\nhumanity marked by the coming solar catastrophe. Digital technologies\noffer the hope of a becoming-inhuman of thought, of thought going on\nwithout a body, one that \u201cshe\u201d offers would have to\ntranscend \u201cthe differend of gender\u201d and corporeal\nexistence (Inhuman, 22\u20133). \u201cShe\u201d argues\nthat suffering and pain can only exist within a body, and thus any\nimpetus to resistance to the literal programming of phrase regimens\n(computer programming being the most purified form of what Lyotard had\ncalled discourse in Discourse, Figure) would disappear. This\nsurmise is no longer hyperbolic: there are myriad research programs in\nSilicon Valley and elsewhere for performing precisely what Lyotard\nsuggests, namely making thought go on without a body, though whether\none could call this thought in the full sense is precisely why Lyotard\ncalls this the \u201csole question\u201d facing humanity, given that\nit goes to what we mean by the word human.\n\nAgainst this notion of the inhuman, akin to what Lyotard years earlier\nhad called the figural, is the inventiveness of another form of the\ninhuman, what would get us beyond the human of humanism and its grand\nnarratives. This event is one that Lyotard links to the youth of the\nchild, since it has ever present possibilities that are nevertheless\nnot presentable or speakable within the phrase regimens of the\npresent, and thus provides a site of resistance to the dominant modes\nof \u201creality\u201d. \u201cBeing prepared to receive what\nthought is not prepared to think\u201d, he writes, \u201cis what\ndeserves the name of thinking\u201d (Inhuman, 73). This form\nof the inhuman, against those who would think of Lyotard as a\ncelebrant of the 1960s death of man and the end of humanism, stands as\na testament to the inventiveness of the human and its irreducibility\nto the machinic\u2014to the point where it can transcend what we\nthought the human was to be. As in Discourse, Figure, it is\nnot that one form of the inhuman exists without the other: the\ntechnical and the artistic are not easily separable, and the arts\nsurvive using techniques and known grammars in order to coming into\nbeing. This is why Lyotard argues that the postmodern, despite\nsuggestions otherwise in The Postmodern Condition, is not a\n\u201cperiod\u201d that comes after the modern. On his view, the\npostmodern is that which exists within the modern itself.\n\nIn any case, computerization seeks the repetition of what exists now\nin modes of efficiency, while the child in the human is open to\npossibilities of the future, the events to come that cannot be\nprogrammed or pre-figured. To attempt the latter, Lyotard claims\nthroughout his later works, is an attempt to control and therefore\nescape time:\n\n\n[I]t must never be forgotten that if thinking indeed consists in\nreceiving the event, it follows that no-one can claim to think without\nbeing ipso facto in a position of resistance to the\nprocedures for controlling time. To think is to question everything,\nincluding thought, and question, and the process. To question requires\nthat something happen that reason has not yet known. In thinking, one\naccepts the occurrence for what it is: \u201cnot yet\u201d\ndetermined. (Inhuman, 74)\n\n\nIn the Inhuman, Lyotard thinks the event not through the\nphrase \u201cWhat is happening\u201d, which presumes that all one\nhas to do is await a form of information, as one does when watching\ntelevision news. Rather the event arrives, as suggested above, through\na questioning, specifically the question \u201cis it happening\u201d\n(\u201carrive-t-il?\u201d), which opens up the possibility\nthat \u201cnothing might happen\u201d (Inhuman, 92). This\nis the terror and pleasure found in Immanuel Kant\u2019s\n(1724\u20131804) account of the sublime in The Critique of\nJudgment (1790), wherein one experiences a feeling that explodes\none\u2019s capacities for imagination and causes both pleasure and\ndispleasure at once (Inhuman, 85). This, for Lyotard, is at\nthe heart of all creation, which comes with the \n\n\nmisery that the painter faces with a plastic surface, of the musician\nwith the acoustic surface, the misery the thinker faces with a desert\nof thought, and so on. (Inhuman, 91)\n\n\nBarnett Newman\u2019s (1905\u20131970) paintings, which often are\nmerely monochromatic with single, straight \u201czips\u201d or lines\ntraversing them, is a paradigm of this. Newman\u2019s paintings offer\nthe \u201cpostmodern sublime\u201d, for Lyotard. Everything in\nNewman\u2019s paintings arrives in an instant, yet what arrives is\nwhat Lyotard calls the postmodern: the unpresentable in presentation\nitself. The paintings have no allusions, no modernist story to them.\nTo their surfaces one can only ask \u201cis it happening?\u201d Any\nanswer to the question fails since it would be attempting to represent\nwhat is not offered in the painting itself. In this way, the\npostmodern artist is modernist in the sense of seeking out what is\nnew, not according to pre-established phrase regimens, but by\nexploring means for finding what cannot be articulated within\nany phrase regimens. Lyotard\u2019s essays on Newman have\nhad an indelible impact on aesthetics and understanding what has been\nunderway in so-called postmodern art. When spectators complain that\npostmodern artists do not present anything to be understood or that\ntheir works withstand interpretation, Lyotard\u2019s claim is that\nthis is precisely the point: to stand against being recuperated within\ndominant modes of thinking. This is the ultimate argument that art is\nfor art\u2019s sake. Art need not provide a political message,\nrepresent reality properly, or morally guide us. Rather postmodern art\nwould be that taking place of a self-enclosed event that withstands\ninterpretation and is irreducible, as art, to any use value.\n",
