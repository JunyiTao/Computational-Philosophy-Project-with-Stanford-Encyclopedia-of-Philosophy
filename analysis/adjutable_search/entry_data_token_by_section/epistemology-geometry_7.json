The task was taken up by\nMoritz Pasch, and most energetically by Italian geometers Pieri,\nPeano, and others in the second half of the 19th century,\nand they succeeded in giving a rigorous account of real and complex\nprojective geometry in two and three dimensions (see Marchisotto and\nSmith 2007). But they managed at the same time to reduce the subject\nto a rigorous training for geometry teachers, and did not appreciate\nthe avenues for research that they had opened. It was left to David\nHilbert to revitalise the axiomatic approach to geometry (see Hallett\nand Majer 2004).\n\nHilbert had been introduced to a number of controversies about\nelementary projective geometry that concerned what results in what\nsettings implied what other results. The most notable concerned\nDesargues\u2019s theorem (see Arana and Mancosu 2012). In\n3-dimensional projective geometry, Desargues\u2019s theorem is a\nconsequence of the incidence axioms alone, but it is a theorem about\npoints and lines in a projective plane (and so in 2-dimensional\ngeometry) yet no-one had been able to derive it from the incidence\naxioms of 2-dimensional projective geometry. It had come to be\nsuspected that it might not be deducible from those axioms alone, and\nGiuseppe Peano was able to show that indeed it could not be deduced\nwithout some extra assumptions. Independently, Hilbert also gave an\nexample of a geometry meeting all the incidence axioms of\n2-dimensional projective geometry but in which Desargues\u2019s\ntheorem was false. It was replaced by the simpler example found by the\nAmerican mathematician and astronomer F.R. Moulton in all later\neditions of Hilbert\u2019s Grundlagen der Geometrie\n(1899).\n\nIn the axiomatic geometries that Hilbert put forward, the fundamental\nobjects (points, lines, planes) are not defined. Instead, Hilbert\nspecified the network of relations that links them, which determines\nhow they can be used and what can be said about them. He presented\nfive families of axioms, sorted according to the concepts they\ncodified. He then created a variety of geometries obeying a variety of\naxioms systems, and established the consistency of them by giving them\ncoordinates over suitable rings and fields\u2014often his geometries\nadmit many interpretations or models. Here Hilbert took advantage of\nhis expertise in the novel theories of number fields and rings. This\ngave these geometries all the consistency of arithmetic, and increased\nHilbert\u2019s interest in attempts to ground arithmetic in some form\nof set theory and logic.\n\nHilbert\u2019s approach thrived because he had come to realise that\nthere was a mathematics of axioms, a study of different but\ninter-related axiom schemes and their implications, and of the axioms\nand their possible interpretations (models). He employed this new\nmethod to solve questions about independence and consistency, hoping\nto find also new insights into simplicity, the solubility of\nmathematical problems, and decidability. Poincar\u00e9, in his\nreview (1902) of Hilbert\u2019s book, accepted the new geometries as\nvalid, but regretted that they were, as he put it, incomplete, because\nthey lacked a psychological component. By this he meant that they\ncould not be accommodated in his explanation of how we develop our\nknowledge of the geometry of physical space on the basis of\nexperience (see section 6.2 below). \n",
