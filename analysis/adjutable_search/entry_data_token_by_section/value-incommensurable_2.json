    "main_text": "Value Incommensurability || Incommensurable or Incomparable?\n1.2 Incommensurable or Incomparable? \n\nBecause the idea of comparison is closely tied to the topic of value\nincommensurability, this has led to use of the term\n\u201cincomparable\u201d alongside \u201cincommensurable\u201d in\nthe literature. Some authors use the terms interchangeably (e.g., Raz\n1986). Others use them to refer to distinct concepts (e.g., Chang\n1997b). This entry will use the term \u201cincomparable\u201d to\nrefer to the possibility that no positive value relation holds between\ntwo value bearers (Chang 1997b). Positive value relations specify how\ntwo items compare (e.g., \u201cbetter than\u201d) rather than how\ntwo items do not compare (e.g., \u201cnot better than\u201d).\n\nIncomparability is often taken to be a three-place relation: A is\nincomparable with B with respect to V. \u201cV\u201d is here some\nspecific consideration for which the items are being compared. One\ncareer may be incomparable to another with respect to the sense of\npurpose it will bring to your life, yet they may be comparable with\nrespect to financial stability since one is clearly better than the\nother in this regard. Some argue that without specifying this\n\u201ccovering consideration\u201d the comparative claim makes no\nsense (Chang 1997; Thomson 1997; Andersson 2016b). Often, however, the\ncovering consideration is not explicitly expressed, but implicitly\nassumed by the context of utterance.\n\nSpecifying the covering consideration also allows us to identify\n\u201cnoncomparability\u201d. If no single covering consideration is\napplicable to the things we are comparing, then the things are\nnoncomparable. For example, the number four is noncomparable with the\ncolor blue with respect to their tastiness. This form of comparative\nfailure is considered to be of no interest from the perspective of\npractical reasoning and is consequently not given much consideration\nin the literature.\n\nFrom the fact that two things are incommensurable i.e., lack a common\nunit of measurement, it does not follow that they are incomparable. It\nis possible to correctly judge that one thing is better than the other\nwhile it being impossible to measure how much better it is. However,\nwhen there is incomparability there is also incommensurability. If no\npositive value relation holds between two things, then they cannot be\nplaced on the same cardinal scale.\n\nWhile both incommensurability and incomparability are important\nconcepts, much of the recent research has focused on the more specific\npossibility of incomparable value bearers. Different competing\naccounts have been given for examples that seem to point to the\npossibility of things being incomparable. These examples often take\nthe form similar to that of Joseph Raz\u2019s example in which a\nperson faces the choice between two successful careers: one as a\nlawyer and one as a clarinetist. Neither career seems better than the\nother, and they also do not appear to be equally good. If they were of\nequal value, then a slightly improved version of the legal career\nwould be better than the musical career, but this judgment appears\nincorrect (Raz 1986, 332).\n\nThe focus on incomparability can be motived by its possible\nsignificance for rational choice. Comparing alternatives are central\nfor rational choice, we want to know what alternative is the best, and\nthus examples of incomparability are taken to be a threat to rational\ndecision-making. Incommensurability on the other hand is mostly of\ntheoretical interest. The possibility of incommensurable values\nintroduces restrictions for normative theories, in the sense that they\nshould not assume that all values can be represented on the same\ncardinal scale. The focus on incomparability can thus be justified by\nreferring to its relation to practical reason and rational choice.\n\nThe remainder of section 1 considers proposed ways in which to\nconceive of value incommensurability.\n",
