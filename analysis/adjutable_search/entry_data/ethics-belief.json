    "preamble": "\n\nThe \u201cethics of belief\u201d refers to a cluster of questions at\nthe intersection of epistemology, ethics, philosophy of mind, and\npsychology.\n\nThe central question in the debate is whether there are norms of some\nsort governing our habits of belief-formation, belief-maintenance, and\nbelief-relinquishment. Is it ever or always morally wrong (or\nepistemically irrational, or practically imprudent)\nto hold a belief on insufficient evidence? Is it ever or always\nmorally right (or epistemically rational, or\npractically prudent) to believe on the basis of sufficient\nevidence, or to withhold belief in the perceived absence of it? Is it\never or always obligatory to seek out all available epistemic evidence\nfor a belief? Are there some ways of obtaining evidence that are\nthemselves immoral, irrational, imprudent?\n\nRelated questions have to do with the nature and structure of the\nnorms involved, if any, as well as the source of their authority. Are\nthey instrumental norms grounded in contingent ends that we set for\nourselves? Are they categorical norms grounded in ends set for us by\nthe very nature of our intellectual or moral capacities? Are there\nother options? And what are the objects of evaluation in this\ncontext\u2014believers, beliefs, or both?\n\nFinally, assuming that there are norms of some sort governing\nbelief-formation, what does that imply about the nature of belief?\nDoes it imply that belief-formation is voluntary or under our control?\nIf so, what sort of control is this? If not, then is talk of an\nethics of belief even coherent?\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Ethics of Belief: A brief history\n1.1 Origins of the debate\n\nThe locus classicus of the ethics of belief debate is,\nunsurprisingly, the essay that christened it. \u201cThe Ethics of\nBelief\u201d was published in 1877 by Cambridge mathematician and\nphilosopher William Kingdon Clifford, in a journal called\nContemporary Review. At the outset of the essay, Clifford\ndefends the stringent principle that we are all always\nobliged to have sufficient evidence for every one of our\nbeliefs. Indeed, the early sections of \u201cThe Ethics of\nBelief\u201d are so stern that William James would later characterize\nClifford as a \u201cdelicious enfant terrible\u201d who\ndefends doxastic self-control \u201cwith somewhat too much of\nrobustious pathos in the voice\u201d (1896, 8). \n\nJames's more permissive view\u2014initially a commentary on Clifford\npresented to the Philosophy Clubs of Yale and Brown, then published as\n\u201cThe Will to Believe\u201d in 1896\u2014has become a kind of\ncompanion piece, and together the two essays constitute the touchstone\nfor later discussions.\n\nClifford's essay is chiefly remembered for two things: a story and a\nprinciple. The story is that of a shipowner who, once upon a time, was\ninclined to sell tickets for a transatlantic voyage. It struck him\nthat his ship was rickety, and that its soundness might be in\nquestion. Knowing that repairs would be costly and cause significant\ndelay, the shipowner managed to push these worries aside and form the\n\u201csincere and comfortable conviction that his vessel was\nthoroughly safe and seaworthy.\u201d He sold the tickets, bade the\npassengers farewell, and then quietly collected the insurance money\n\u201cwhen she went down in mid-ocean and told no tales\u201d (1877,\n70).\n\nAccording to Clifford (who himself once survived a shipwreck, and so\nmust have found this behavior particularly loathsome), the owner in\nthe story was \u201cverily guilty of the death of those men,\u201d\nbecause even though he sincerely believed that the ship was sound,\n\u201che had no right to believe on such evidence as was before\nhim.\u201d Why did he have no such right? Because, says Clifford,\n\u201che had acquired his belief not by honestly earning it in\npatient investigation, but by stifling his doubts\u201d (1877, 70).\nAfter making this diagnosis, Clifford changes the end of the story:\nthe ship doesn't meet a liquid demise, but rather arrives safe and\nsound into New York harbor. Does the new outcome relieve the shipowner\nof blame for his belief? \u201cNot one jot,\u201d Clifford declares:\nhe is equally guilty\u2014equally blameworthy\u2014for believing\nsomething on insufficient evidence. \n\nClifford goes on to cite our intuitive indictments of the\nshipowner\u2014in both versions of the story\u2014as grounds for his\nfamous principle: \n\n(Clifford's Principle) \u201cIt is wrong always,\neverywhere, and for anyone to believe anything on insufficient\nevidence.\u201d\n\n\nDespite the synchronic character of his famous Principle,\nClifford's view is not merely that we must be in a certain state at\nthe precise time at which we form a belief. Rather, the obligation\nalways and only to believe on sufficient evidence governs our\nactivities across time as well. With respect to most if not all of the\npropositions we consider as candidates for belief, says Clifford, we\nare obliged to go out and gather evidence, remain open to new\nevidence, and consider the evidence offered by others. The\ndiachronic obligation here can be captured as follows:\n\n(Clifford's Other Principle) \u201cIt is wrong\nalways, everywhere, and for anyone to ignore evidence that is relevant\nto his beliefs, or to dismiss relevant evidence in a facile\nway.\u201d (Van Inwagen 1996, 145)\n\n\nThere might be at least two kinds of diachronic obligation here: one\ngoverning how we form and hold beliefs over time, and the other\ngoverning how we relinquish or revise beliefs over time. If someone\nviolates such a diachronic obligation by \u201cpurposely avoiding the\nreading of books and the company of men who call in question\u201d\nhis presuppositions, Clifford warns, then \u201cthe life of that man\nis one long sin against mankind\u201d (1877, 77). \n\nDespite the robustious pathos, it is not clear in the end that\nClifford's considered position is as extreme as these two principles\nmake it sound. In the later part of his essay Clifford puts forward a\nview about what it is for evidence to be \u201csufficient\u201d that\nsuggests a more moderate stance. Still, the story about the shipowner\ntogether with the sternly-worded Principles turned Clifford into the\niconic representative of a strict \u201cEvidentialist\u201d position\nin the ethics of belief\u2014the position, roughly, that we are\nobliged to form beliefs always and only on the basis of sufficient\nevidence that is in our possession. (For more on the notion of\n\u201cevidence\u201d and the varieties of Evidentialism, see\n\u00a74-\u00a75 below).\n\nJames's Non-Evidentialist alternative to Clifford is far more\npermissive: it says that there are some contexts in which it is fine\nto form a belief even though we don't have sufficient\nevidence for it, and even though we know that we don't. In fact, James\nand many of his \u201cpragmatist\u201d followers claim that\nsometimes we are positively obliged to form beliefs on\ninsufficient evidence, and that it would be a significant prudential,\nintellectual, or even moral failure to do otherwise. \u201cOur\npassional nature not only lawfully may, but must, decide an option\nbetween propositions, whenever it is a genuine option that cannot by\nits nature be decided on intellectual grounds\u201d (1896, 11).\n\nAs permissive as this sounds, however, James is by no means writing a\nblank doxastic check. In \u201cThe Will to Believe\u201d he lays out\na series of strict conditions under which an \u201coption\u201d\ncounts as \u201cgenuine\u201d and believing without sufficient\nevidence is permitted or required. For instance, the option must be\nbetween \u201clive\u201d hypotheses\u2014i.e. hypotheses that are\n\u201camong the mind's possibilities\u201d (thus, belief in the\nancient Greek gods is not a live option for us these days). There must\nalso be no compelling evidence one way or the other, the option must\nbe \u201cforced\u201d such that doing nothing also amounts to making\na choice, and the option must concern a \u201cmomentous\u201d issue.\nIn the absence of those conditions, James reverts happily to a broadly\nEvidentialist picture (see Gale 1980, 1999, Kasser and Shah 2006, and\nAikin 2014). (For more on the varieties of Non-Evidentialism, see\n\u00a76 below).\n1.2 The ethics of belief before the 19th-century\n\nThe phrase may be of 19th-century coinage, but there were\nobviously ethics of belief well before Clifford and James. Descartes\nsays in the Meditations that when forming a judgment,\n\u201cit is clear by the natural light that perception of the\nintellect should always precede (praecedere semper debere)\nthe determination of the will\u201d (1641, 7:60). In the context of a\nsearch for certain knowledge (scientia), Descartes maintains,\nwe have the obligation to withhold assent from all propositions whose\ntruth we do not clearly and distinctly perceive (clear and distinct\nperceptions themselves, by contrast, will produce belief ineluctably).\nIn other contexts, it may be both permissible and prudent to form a\nmere \u201copinion\u201d (opinio) whose truth we do not\nclearly and distinctly perceive. Even then, however, we are obliged to\nhave some sort of evidence before giving our assent. Thus\nDescartes advises Elizabeth that \u201cthough we cannot have certain\ndemonstrations of everything, still we must take sides, and in matters\nof custom embrace the opinions that seem the most probable,\nso that we may never be irresolute when we need to act\u201d (1645,\n4:295, my emphasis). \n\nLocke's ethics of belief is at least as strict: in the search for\nscientific knowledge as well as in all matters of \u201cmaximal\nconcernment,\u201d Locke says, it is to \u201ctransgress against our\nown light\u201d either to believe on insufficient evidence, or to\nfail to proportion our degree of belief to the strength of the\nevidence. In his discussion of \u201cFaith\u201d in the Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding, Locke famously moralizes:\n\nHe that believes without having any Reason for believing, may be in\nlove with his own Fancies; but neither seeks Truth as he ought, nor\npays the Obedience due to his Maker, who would have him use those\ndiscerning Faculties he has given him, to keep him out of Mistake and\nErrour. (1690, 687)\n\n\nTo form a belief about important matters without possessing sufficient\nevidence\u2014or to believe anything with a degree of firmness that\nis not proportioned to the strength of our evidence\u2014is to misuse\nour faculties and court all manner of error. It is also, for Locke, to\ncontravene the will of our \u201cMaker.\u201d Given his divine\ncommand theory of ethical rightness, it thus appears that such\nbehavior will be morally as well as epistemically wrong.\n\nBy contrast, Blaise Pascal and Immanuel Kant anticipated James by\nemphasizing that there are some very important issues regarding which\nwe do not and cannot have sufficient evidence one way or the other,\nbut which deserve our firm assent (on practical grounds) nonetheless.\n(For more on Pascal and Kant on Non-Evidentialism, see \u00a76.1\nbelow).\n2. Doxastic Norms\n2.1 Kinds of norms: prudential, moral, epistemic\n\nThis last point makes it clear that there may be different types of\nnorms governing practices of belief-formation, and that these will\ncorrespond to different types of value. The ethicist of belief will\nthus need to specify the type of value she is invoking, why and how\nshe thinks it can ground doxastic norms, whether it is the only kind\nof value that does that, and (if not) what the priority relations are\nbetween norms based in different kinds of value. \n\nClifford and Locke, as we have seen, claim that the issue of whether\nwe have done our doxastic best is an epistemic one and also\n(given a few further premises) a moral one. James, on the\nother hand, focuses on the important role played by\nprudential value in the ethics of belief, saying in one\npassage that Clifford's Principle not only puts us at \u201crisk of\nlosing the truth\u201d and thus of violating an epistemic norm, but\nthat it articulates an \u201cinsane logic\u201d\u2014an\n\u201cabsurdity\u201d that guarantees prudential disaster (1896,\n25). The general idea is that if something is beneficial, and\nbelieving that p will help us achieve, acquire, or actualize\nthat thing, then it is prima facie prudent for us to believe\nthat p. This will be true even if we lack sufficient evidence\nfor the belief that p, and even if we are aware of that\nlack.\n\nConsider for example someone who reads in the psychological literature\nthat people are much more likely to survive a cancer diagnosis if they\nfirmly believe that they will survive it. Upon being diagnosed with\nthe disease himself, and in light of the fact that his goal is to\nsurvive, it will be prudent for this person to believe that he will\nsurvive, even if he knows that he (and his doctors) lack sufficient\nevidence for that belief. James refers to such cases as ones\n\u201cwhere faith in a fact can help create the fact\u201d (1896,\n25).\n\nSomeone might suggest that the patient's knowledge that his\n\u201cfaith helps create the fact\u201d itself counts as a\nkind of evidence in its favor. If this is right, then the case would\nnot be in tension with Clifford's Principle after all. But other cases\ncan be used to make the same point: Pascal famously argues that it is\nrequired by prudential rationality that we believe in God,\neven though we lack sufficient evidence for that belief, and even\nthough such belief would play no role in \u201ccreating\u201d the\nfact that it describes (Pascal 1670).\n\nHere\u2019s a non-religious example: suppose that you would like to\nretain a good relationship with your teenage son, and you are aware\nthat this requires believing the best of him whenever possible. You\nalso have some moderate but not compelling olfactory evidence that he\nis using drugs in the house when you are away (in response to your\nqueries, he claims that he has recently taken up transcendental\nmeditation, and that the funny smell when you come home is just\nincense). Suppose too that you know yourself well enough to know that\nyour relationship with your son will be seriously damaged if you come\nto view him as a habitual drug-user. This suggests that you would\nviolate a prudential norm if you go ahead and believe that he is. In\nother words, it is prudent, given your ends, to withhold belief about\nthe source of the aroma altogether, or even to believe, if possible,\nthat he is not smoking pot but rather burning incense in your absence.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if you regard the occasional use of recreational\ndrugs as harmless fun that expresses a healthy contempt for\noverweening state authority (in some states, at least), then it might\nbe prudent for you\u2014confronted with the telltale odor\u2014to\nform the belief that your son has indeed taken up the habit in\nquestion. Either way, the recommendation here aims at a kind of\nprudential or pragmatic value, and not at the truth per se.\n(For some recent arguments in favor of prudential evidence for belief,\nsee Reisner 2008 and 2009; for arguments against, see Adler 2002 and\nShah 2006). \n2.2 Structures of norms: hypothetical vs. categorical\n\nIn addition to being sorted according to the type of value\ninvolved, doxastic obligations can be sorted according to their\nstructure. The main distinction here is between\nhypothetical and categorical structure.\n\nPrudential norms usually have a hypothetical structure: if\nyou have prudential reason to survive the disease, and if\nbelieving that you are going to do so will help you achieve this end,\nthen you have a prima facie obligation to believe that you\nare going to survive. Likewise, if you want to protect your\nrelationship with your son, and if believing that he is\ndeceiving you and taking drugs will damage your ability to trust him,\nthen you are prima facie obliged to withhold that belief.\n\nPut more generally: if you have a prudential end E, and\nbelief that p is likely to make E obtain, then you\nhave a prima facie obligation to believe that p. The\nobligation will be particularly powerful (though still prima\nfacie) if E cannot be achieved other than through belief\nthat p, and if you are (or should be) aware of that fact.\n(For more on hypothetical norms generally, see Broome 1999 and\nSchroeder 2005)\n\nThe structure of moral and epistemic norms can also be construed\nhypothetically in this way. The ends in question will presumably be\ndoing the morally right thing or promoting the moral\ngood, on the one hand, and acquiring significant\nknowledge or minimizing significant false belief, on the\nother (see Foley 1987). Achieving these ends clearly does involve an\nincrease in well-being on most conceptions of the latter.\n\nHowever, because these ends are putatively set for us not by a\ncontingent act of will but rather by our nature as morally engaged,\nknowledge-seeking beings, some philosophers regard them as\ncategorical rather than instrumental imperatives. In other\nwords, they take these norms to say not merely that if we\nwant to achieve various hypothetical ends, then we have the\nprima facie obligation to believe in such-and-such ways.\nRather, the norms say that we do have these ends as a matter\nof natural or moral necessity, and thus that we prima facie\nought to believe in such-and-such ways.\n\nNote, however, that the most general prudential end\u2014something\nlike surviving, say\u2014may be thought to have an equal\nclaim to the title of a \u201cnecessary\u201d end: it is set for us\nby our nature as living members of a species that has evolved through\nnatural selection. And so by the same logic it might be taken to\nunderwrite a categorical\u2014albeit still prudential\u2014norm of\nbelief, especially in life-or-death cases such as that of the cancer\ndiagnosis above.\n2.3 Degrees of reflective access\n\nSo far the norms involved in the ethics of belief have been\ncharacterized without attention to reflective access requirements. A\nreflective access requirement has to do with the\nsubject\u2019s own reflective awareness of some of the relevant\nfacts.\n\nIn order to see how such requirements can play a role, consider the\nfollowing prudential doxastic norm:\n\n(A) If S has end E, and if S's believing\nthat p is likely to make E obtain, then S has a\nprima facie prudential obligation to believe that p.\n\n\nThis is a purely objective or \u2018unreflective\u2019 account of\nthe prudential obligation in question: it is simply concerned with\nwhether the subject in fact has a certain end and whether\nin fact the belief that p is likely to lead to the\naccomplishment of that end. If (A) were the right way to articulate\nobligations in the ethics of belief, then we would have far more\nprima facie doxastic obligations than we realize.\n\nReflective or \u2018subjective\u2019 components can be added to\nnorms in order to make the results more plausible:\n\n(B) If S knows that she has an end\nE, and if S knows that believing that p is\nlikely to make E obtain, then S has a prima facie\nprudential obligation to believe that p.\n\n\n(B) is towards the top of the scale in terms of reflective access\nrequirements: S has to know that he has E and that believing\nthat p is likely to make E obtain . As a sufficient\ncondition for having a doxastic obligation, it may be acceptable, but\nmost ethicists of belief will not want to make the reflective\nknowledge necessary in order for there to be genuine\nprima facie prudential obligations.\n\nIntermediate positions would replace \u201cknows\u201d in one or\nboth parts of the antecedent of (B) with something weaker: \u201cis\nin a position to know,\u201d \u201cjustifiably believes,\u201d\n\u201cis justified in believing,\u201d, believes, and so on.\n\nNote that an ethicist of belief who wants to include a reflective\naccess requirement in a doxastic norm would need to do so in a way\nthat doesn't generate an infinite regress. Note too that the norms we\nconsidered above govern the positive formation of belief. An\naccount of the plausible conditions of reflective access may be\nsomewhat different for norms of maintaining, suspending, and\nrelinquishing belief (for suspending, see Tang 2015 and Perin\n2015).\n2.4 Relations between doxastic norms\n\nAnother closely-related debate has to do with the types of value that\ncan generate doxastic norms and obligations. Value monists in the\nethics of belief argue that only one type of value (usually some kind\nof epistemic value) can generate such norms. A prominent kind of\nmonism, often called \u201cveritism\u201d, says that truth is the\nfundamental doxastic good: its value is not grounded in knowledge or\nanything else (see Pritchard 2011, Gardiner 2012, Ahlstrom-Vij\n2013).\n\nOther more permissive accounts go beyond the three types of value\nconsidered above\u2014prudential, moral, and epistemic\u2014to\nsuggest that there are other types that can generate doxastic\nobligations as well. Perhaps there are aesthetic norms that\nguide us to beliefs that have some sort of aesthetic merit, or that\nmake us qua subjects more beautiful in virtue of believing them. There\nmay also be social norms that govern beliefs we form in our\nvarious communal roles (as lawyers, priests, psychiatrists, friends,\nparents, etc. (regarding the doxastic obligations of friends, see\nKeller 2004, Stroud 2006, and Aikin 2008)) and political\nnorms that govern beliefs we form as citizens, subjects, voters, and\nso on (here see the second half of Matheson and Vitz 2014). \n\nIt's an interesting and open question whether such aesthetic, social,\nor political norms could be cashed out in terms of epistemic, moral,\nand prudential norms (e.g. perhaps being someone's lawyer or being\nsomeone's friend underwrites certain moral or\nprudential norms of belief regarding his or her innocence).\nIn any case, the three types of underlying value considered above are\nthe ones most frequently discussed under the rubric of the\n\u201cethics of belief.\u201d\n\nNorms, and types of norms, can be related in different ways. According\nto the interpretation of Clifford presented above, there is a strong\nconnection between the epistemic and the moral types: the fact that\nthere is an epistemic norm to believe always and only on sufficient\nevidence entails that there is an analogous moral norm. The\nreasoning here seems to be as follows:\n\n\n(P1) We have an epistemic obligation to possess\nsufficient evidence for all of our beliefs;\n\n(P2) We have a moral obligation to uphold our\nepistemic obligations;\n\n(C) Thus, we have a moral obligation to possess\nsufficient evidence for all of our beliefs.\n\n\nThis formulation keeps the types of values distinct while still\nforging a link between them in the form of (P2). But of course we\nwould need to find a sound sub-argument in favor of (P2) (see\nDougherty 2014).\n\nIn some places, Clifford seems simply to presume that epistemic duty\nis a species of ethical duty. That would make sense of why he thinks\nit just obvious that the shipowner is \u201cequally\nguilty\u201d\u2014regardless of whether the ship sinks. Elsewhere\nClifford defends (P2) by reference to our need to rely on the\ntestimony of others in order to avoid significant harm and advance\nscientific progress. No belief is without effect, he claims: at the\nvery least, believing on insufficient evidence (even with respect to\nan apparently very insignificant issue) is liable to lead to the\nlowering of epistemic standards in other more important contexts too.\nAnd that could, in turn, have bad moral consequences.\n\nElsewhere still Clifford seems not to recognize a distinction between\nepistemic and moral obligations at all (see Van Inwagen 1996, Haack\n1997, Wood 2002, and Zamulinski 2002 for further discussion of\nClifford on this issue).\n\nIt was noted earlier that one way to read Locke is as arguing for (P2)\nvia the independent theoretical premise that God's will for us is that\nwe follow Evidentialist norms, together with a divine command theory\nof moral rightness (see Wolterstorff 1996). But Locke can also be read\nas primarily interested in defending (P1) rather than (P2) or (C) (see\nBrandt Bolton 2009).\n\nA virtue-theoretic approach, by contrast, might defend (P2) by\nclaiming not that a particular unjustified belief causes moral harm,\nbut rather that regularly ignoring our epistemic obligations is a bad\nintellectual habit, and that having a bad intellectual habits is a way\nof having a bad moral character (Zagzebski 1996, Roberts and Wood\n2007).\n\nIn addition to using theoretical arguments like these, ethicists of\nbelief can connect doxastic norms by appealing to empirical data. If\nwe discover through investigation that it is on the whole prudent to\nbe morally good, then prudential norms may be able support some of the\nmoral norms. Similarly, if we discover that following moral norms of\nbelief reliably leads to the acquisition of knowledge, then there may\nbe a track-record argument that goes from epistemic norms to moral\nnorms (this would effectively be an empirical argument in support of\n(P2) above). And if we empirically find that adhering to epistemic\nnorms also promotes the moral good, then there will be an argument\nfrom the moral to the epistemic. \n\nFinally, norms and types of norms can be in outright tension. The\nprudential norm recommending belief that your son is not smoking pot\nwhen you're gone conflicts with the epistemic norm to follow your\nperceptual evidence. Likewise, the moral norm to believe the best of\nothers is often tragically in tension with the epistemic norm to\nbelieve what the evidence supports, with the prudential norm to\nbelieve whatever it takes in order to get ahead, and so on.\n\nTension or conflict can also exist between doxastic obligations of a\ndiachronic sort. The epistemic norm to gather as much evidence as\npossible may conflict with the prudential norm to believe in such a\nway as to save time and effort (example: the fastidious boss who never\nhires anyone until he has investigated a candidate's entire past,\ncalled every reference, and confirmed every qualification). It also\nconflicts with the moral norm not to believe on the basis of evidence\ngathered in an immoral fashion (example: the doctor who gathers\nevidence about human diseases by performing inhumane experiments on\nprisoners).\n\nEthicists of belief who are not value monists often claim that there\nis a way of ordering norms or types of norms in terms of the relative\nstrength or relative ease with which their claims on us can be\ndefeated. This means that in a given situation there will be a\ndeterminate answer about what one ought to believe \u201call things\nconsidered.\u201d Others argue, however, that at least some of the\nnorms are incommensurable, and that in many cases there will simply be\nno answer to the question of what it is right to believe all things\nconsidered (Feldman 2000). Still others think that one category of\nnorm collapses into another and that this can give us an all things\nconsidered conclusion (for discussion of whether epistemic rationality\ncollapses into prudential rationality, for example, see Kelly\n2003)\n\nIn sum: a full-blown ethics of belief will say something about the\naxiological sources of the different types of norms, about the\ninferential relations between them, about their temporal range\n(synchronic/diachronic) and about what to do when norms conflict. (See\nBroome 1999 and Kolodny 2005)\n3. Belief, its Aims, and Our Control Over It\n3.1 The nature of belief\n\nQuestions about what\n belief\n is and how it is formed have typically played a marginal role in the\nethics of belief debate. There is agreement among most analytic\nphilosophers that belief is (roughly) a dispositional, affirmative\nattitude towards a proposition or state of affairs. To believe that\np is to take it that p is true\u2014to take it that\nthe state of affairs described by the sentence\n\u201cp\u201d obtains. Note that this doesn't mean that the\nsubject explicitly believes the proposition that p is true,\nhowever, since the latter is a different and higher order belief (mere\nbelief that p doesn't require possession of the concept of\n\u201ctruth\u201d, for instance, whereas the belief that p is\ntrue does). It is also widely agreed that the majority of our\nbeliefs are not occurrent at any given time, and that belief comes in\ndegrees of strength, confidence, or firmness.\n\nAfter this, however, agreement breaks down. Representationalists\nregard beliefs as structures in the mind that represent the\npropositions they affirm\u2014usually in something like a mental\nlanguage (see Fodor 1975 and the entry on\n language of thought).\n Behavioralist-dispositionalists regard beliefs as dispositions to\nact in certain ways in certain circumstances (see Braithwaite\n1932\u20131933). Eliminativists regard talk of \u201cbeliefs\u201d\nas designating convenient fictions that we ascribe to people in folk\npsychology (see Churchland 1981 and the entry on\n eliminative materialism).\n Primitivists think of beliefs as basic mental states which do not\nadmit of analysis. And so on. There is also a big controversy\nregarding whether the most fundamental concept here is of degrees of\nbelief (or credences). \n\nThis disagreement about the nature of belief has (thus far at least)\nnot been taken to impinge on the ethics of belief debate in\nsignificant ways. Of course, eliminativists and behavioralists will\nhave to say that doxastic norms\u2014if there are any\u2014apply at\nbottom to non-doxastic states. Still, modulo those kinds of changes,\nthese and other ontological analyses of belief seem compatible with\nmany different accounts of its ethics.\n3.2 The aim(s) of belief\n\nBy contrast, theories about the aim or goal of\nbelief typically have an immediate and substantive impact on\nconceptions of its ethics, and can be used, in particular, to answer\nquestions about the relative importance of various norms, whether\nthere are \u201call things considered\u201d obligations in a given\nsituation, and so on (see Velleman 2000, Wedgwood 2002,\nSteglich-Peterson 2009, and the essays in Chan 2013 for general\ndiscussion; see C\u00f4t\u00e9-Bouchard forthcoming for a critique\nof the move from aim of belief to doxastic norm).\n\nA few philosophers and psychologists argue that simply acquiring\nsignificant truth while avoiding significant\nfalsehood is the only aim of belief, and thus that any doxastic\nobligations will be structured accordingly (see David 2001). Others\nargue that there are important aims in addition to, or even in lieu\nof, the aim of truth-acquisition\u2014aims that can underwrite other\ndoxastic norms (Velleman 2000, Sosa 2000, Sosa 2003, Gibbons 2013). A\ncommon candidate here, of course, is knowledge itself (see Williamson\n2000, Pritchard 2007, Simion et al. 2016 and the entry on the\n value of knowledge),\n but some authors claim that justification (Adler 2002, Gibbons 2013)\nand/or doxastic \u201cvirtue\u201d is the aim (Zagzebski 2004, Sosa\n2011, Wright 2014), while still others plump for a more structurally\ncomplex aim such as \u201cunderstanding\u201d (Kvanvig 2003, Kvanvig\n2009, Grimm 2012). (Note, though, that other authors argue that\nunderstanding doesn\u2019t even involve belief (Hunter 1998;\nDells\u00e9n forthcoming)). \n\nAs mentioned earlier, in cognitive science and evolutionary biology,\nit is often assumed that the aim of belief (as well as of almost every\nother process) is something like \u201csurvival.\u201d There are\nongoing disagreements, however, about the extent to which that is\ncorrect and, even if it is, whether it is necessarily or even\ncontingently connected to the aim of truth-acquisition (Stich 1990,\nPlantinga 2002, Street 2006).\n\nA very different kind of candidate for the aim of belief would be\nsomething like pleasure broadly-speaking, or perhaps\n\u201cfeeling at home in the world.\u201d If one of these is the\naim, then the norms it underwrites might at times lead away\nfrom truth. For example: suppose Smith is the sort of guy who feels\ngreat pleasure when he believes that everyone he knows thinks highly\nof him, and pleasure is an aim that underwrites a doxastic norm. Then\nSmith has a prima facie obligation to believe that his friend\nJones thinks the world of him.\n\nThis is clearly one of the places where debates about psychological\nstrategies such as self-deception, \u201cbad faith,\u201d\nwish-fulfillment, \u201cirony,\u201d and the like become germane in\nthe ethics of belief (see Wisdo 1991, Wisdo 1993, Mele 2001, Wood\n2002, and the entry on\n self deception).\n If the aims of belief can plausibly be regarded as wide\nenough to include truth-neutral states such as pleasure or\n\u201cfeeling at home in the world,\u201d and if these aims can\nunderwrite genuine norms, then Evidentialism as characterized below\nclearly delivers a far-too-narrow characterization of its ethics.\n\nWe have seen that our conception of the aim of belief can influence\nour conception of doxastic norms. But it can also affect the extent to\nwhich parallels can be drawn between the ethics of belief and the\nethics of action generally. If one adopts \u201cvalue monism\u201d\nin the ethics of belief (whether it be veritism of some other\nkind of value), then there will be a strong parallel to monistic\nconsequentialist theories in the ethics of action (DePaul 2001). \n\nA remaining difference between consequentialism in epistemology and in\nethics, however, is that a belief\u2019s success at achieving its aim\nis typically evaluated by epistemologists all at once in the moment it\nis formed, whereas in the case of an action, subsequent consequences\nare relevant to the evaluation of its moral rightness, and many of\nthese consequences won\u2019t be known (if at all) until much later\n(for an extended comparison of these two kinds of consequentialism,\nsee Briesen 2017). That said, it is possible to imagine a diachronic\nethics of belief according to which truth is the sole aim of belief,\nbut we evaluate particular beliefs not just on whether they are true\nbut also on their ability to enable or produce the subsequent\nacquisition of other true beliefs.\n\nIf we have a theory according to which the aim of belief is complex,\nhowever, then parallels to the ethics of action become more\ncomplicated. An ethicist of belief who holds that acquiring\nsignificant truth in the right way is the aim of belief, and\nanalyzes the \u201crightness\u201d of a belief-forming practice in\nterms of its ability to lead to truth, may find that the relevant\nparallel is to rule-consequentialism. By contrast, the view that the\naim of belief is simply to believe in the right way,\nregardless of whether that \u201cright way\u201d reliably leads to\nsignficant truth, looks like the analogue of a deontological position\nin ethics that emphasizes the intentional following of right\nprinciples rather than the achievement of some aim external to the act\nitself. Whether or not these parallels are illuminating, and whether a\nview in the ethics of belief constrains our options in the ethics of\naction, is still an open question (see Kornblith 1983, Dougherty\n2014).\n\nThere are many other variations here. It seems possible to defend the\nview, for instance, that we ought only to believe on sufficient\nevidence\u2014as the Evidentialists teach\u2014but that our\nconception of the aims of belief might provide further and more\ndeterminate necessary conditions for permissible belief. It is also\npossible to argue that the aim of belief makes it the case that we\nhave practical reasons for thinking that only epistemic\nreasons can license belief (Whiting 2014). \n\nFinally, it may be possible to defend the view that belief by its\nnature has no specific aim, but is rather a state that can\nconstitute or lead to any number of different goods. If that is right,\nthen we obviously cannot look to the aim of belief to underwrite an\naccount of its ethics.\n3.3 Knowledge as the norm of belief\n\nWe have already seen that some theorists take knowledge to be the (or\nat least an) aim of belief. Some philosophers go further and say that\nknowledge is also the norm of belief - that is, that any\nbelief that does not also count as knowledge is impermissible or\nirrational or vicious or defective. Put another way: knowing that p is\nboth a necessary and a sufficient condition for permissibly\n(rationally, virtuously) believing that p. \n\nOne argument for the claim that knowledge is the norm of belief seeks\nto infer that result from the claim that knowledge is the aim of\nbelief. The aim generates the norm, and any belief that fails to\nachieve the aim also fails to obey the norm. Perhaps the most\nprominent argument along these lines starts with the related claim\nthat knowledge is the \u201cnorm of assertion \u201d\u2014i.e.,\nthat we ought not assert a proposition if we don\u2019t know it (see\nWilliamson 2000). But if that\u2019s the case, and if belief is the\n\u201cinner\u201d analogue of assertion, then it looks as though we\nalso ought only to believe a proposition when the belief counts as\nknowledge. The debate then has to do with whether knowledge really is\nthe norm of assertion, and, if so, whether \u201cbelief\u201d is an\ninner analogue of assertion in such a way that the norm carries over\n(see Sutton 2005, Huemer 2007b, Bach 2008, Goldberg 2009). \n\nOne reason that this position can seem counterintuitive is that an\nimportant role that norms often play is that of guiding action. The\nprinciple that we should only believe what we know is not a very\nhelpful action-guiding norm, since we often don\u2019t know what we\nknow (according to most epistemologists, at least). Of course, if I\nadopt this norm, and know that I don\u2019t know that p,\nthen I\u2019ll see that I shouldn\u2019t believe that p either (this\nnegative formulation is what Williamson uses in 2000, 256). But,\nagain, most epistemologists do not think we are typically able to\ntell, from the inside, whether we would know the proposition in\nquestion if we believed it. And yet that ability seems to be\npresupposed by the idea that this is an action-guiding norm. Another\nobjection to the idea that knowledge is the norm of belief is more\nintuitive: knowledge seems to most of us like a different sort of\naccomplishment than belief, or even justified belief, or (after\nGettier) even justified true belief. It is one thing to say that we\nacquire the concept of belief by looking at paradigm cases of\nknowledge and then subtracting different elements from them (for\ninstance: \u201cjustified belief would be just like knowledge but\nwithout truth\u201d). It is quite another to say that no belief can\ncount as properly formed unless it also counts as knowledge (for more\non all this, see Benton, Other Internet Resources) \n3.4 Belief-control\n\nA third foundational issue related to the nature of belief has to do\nwith whether or not belief-formation is in some way voluntary or under\nthe control of the will. This issue, too, has an effect on the ethics\nof belief. Many philosophers and psychologists have concluded that\nbelief is a more or less involuntary response to perceived evidence.\nBut if a behavior isn't \u2018up to us\u2019 in any important sense,\nthen it is hard to see how we could be responsible for performing it\n(see Alston 1989 for an influential argument along these lines).\n\nIn response to this \u201cdoxastic involuntarist\u201d challenge ,\nsome philosophers argue that we do have direct control over at least\nsome of our beliefs (Ginet 2001, Weatherson 2008), or that we at least\nhave control over which beliefs are suspended or relinquished (Rott\nforthcoming). Others develop a kind of hybrid view that allows certain\nkinds of belief-formation to count as free and \u2018up to us,\u2019\neven if they are also caused in us (see Steup 2000, Ryan 2003). Some\nexplicitly reject any parallel between free will and free belief\n(Wagner forthcoming). Still others focus on the fact that we can be\npraised and blamed for beliefs (as well as actions) that are not under\nour control, even if there are no obligations on belief-formation.\n(Adams 1985, Hieronymi 2006, Southwood and Chuard 2009). \n\nYet another response, compatible with many of those list above,\ninvolves an account of indirect ways in which\nbelief-formation counts as voluntary and thus susceptible to normative\nevaluation (e.g., Pascal 1670, Feldman 2000, Audi 2001, Yee 2002, Leon\n2002, Audi 2008b). Another option is to take the doxastic\ninvoluntarist challenge to motivate a new focus on positive\npropositional attitudes that are by definition voluntary\n\u2013 \u201cacceptances,\u201d for instance (see Cohen 1992,\nBratman 1992, Engel 2000, Audi 2008a, and \u00a77 below). Finally,\nsome ethicists of belief seek to argue that there are some\nobligations on direct belief-formation while also absorbing the\nputative empirical datum that much of it is not under the control of\nthe will (see Feldman and Conee 1985, Feldman 2000, Adler 2005,\nHieronymi 2006 and 2008).\n4. Evidentialism: an overview\n4.1 Strict vs. moderate\n\nEvidentialism of some sort is far and away the dominant ethic of\nbelief among early modern and contemporary philosophers alike. The\ncentral principle, as mentioned earlier, is that one ought only to\nbase one's beliefs on relevant evidence (i.e. evidence that bears on\nthe truth of the proposition) that is in one's possession. Many\nEvidentialists (Locke, Hume, and Clifford, for example) add the\ncondition that the amount of evidence in one's possession must be\nproportioned to one's degree of belief, and that one should only\nfirmly believe on the basis of \u201csufficient\u201d\nevidence (where \u201csufficient\u201d involves the evidence being\nstrong enough for the belief to count as knowledge if true). Some also\nadd one of the reflective access requirements mentioned above: for\ninstance, that we ought to know (or being a position to know, or\njustifiably believe, or be justified in believing) that we have\nevidence for the original belief or even that the amount of evidence\nwe have is sufficient (for a survey of these positions and their\ncritics, see the essays in Dougherty 2011).\n\nOnce a principle along these lines has been chosen, the relative\nstrictness of a given Evidentialist position will be a function of how\nmany exceptions it allows. The strictest sort of\nEvidentialist\u2014Clifford, at least on standard readings\u2014says\nthat the principle holds \u201calways, everywhere, and for\nanyone\u201d (though note, again, that Clifford himself qualifies\nthis later in his essay). There are problems with such a strict\nposition, however, including the threat of the infinite regress that\narises if the strict Evidentialist also requires that we\nbelieve that we have sufficient evidence for all of our\nbeliefs.\n\nIn contrast, moderate Evidentialists take their principles to be\nexceptionable; thus they allow that there are some circumstances in\nwhich subjects are rationally permitted to form beliefs in the absence\nof sufficient evidence. They might hold that the Cliffordian view\napplies, say, to the beliefs formed by a military pilot about the\nlocation of a legitimate bombing target in the midst of a residential\narea, or the beliefs formed by a government health official regarding\nthe efficacy of a pharmaceutical trial, at least insofar as these\nbeliefs lead to morally or prudentially significant actions. But at\nthe same time they might think it permissible to abandon these strict\nstandards in ordinary contexts where not much is at stake\u2014for\ninstance, the everyday belief that there is still some milk in the\nfridge. If the number of exceptions is very large, then the position\nends up looking more like one of the Non-Evidentialist positions\ndescribed below. As a result, the boundary between a very moderate\nEvidentialism and full-blown Non-Evidentialism can be quite\nblurry.\n\nAs difficult as it is to defend strict or thoroughgoing Evidentialism,\nit is even harder to defend the view that Evidentialism is\ninappropriate in every domain. The cases of the pilot and the\nhealth official are ones in which the subject's beliefs (largely as a\nresult of the actions to which they lead) simply must, we think, meet\nsome very high standards of evidence. Accordingly, at least some sort\nof moderate or context-specific Evidentialism seems overwhelmingly\nplausible.\n\nWe have seen that the distinction between strict Evidentialism and\nmoderate Evidentialism is quite sharp but that the line between\nmoderate Evidentialism and Non-Evidentialism is rather blurry. Perhaps\nthe best place to make a distinction between moderate Evidentialism\nand full-blown Non-Evidentialism is over whether a subject can be not\nonly permitted but also obliged to form a belief on\ninsufficient evidence (or, depending on the reflective access\nconditions, on what she takes to be insufficient evidence) in certain\nsituations. An ethicist of belief who affirms this, it seems\nreasonable to say, has thereby abandoned even the most moderate form\nof Evidentialism and moved into the Non-Evidentialist camp (see\n\u00a76 below).\n4.2 Synchronic vs. diachronic\n\nIt was noted earlier that doxastic norms can be either synchronic or\ndiachronic. Clifford's Principle itself is articulated as a synchronic\nnorm, but in the later portions of the \u201cEthics of Belief,\u201d\nhe is more concerned to articulate diachronic principles regarding\nevidence-collection and evidence-assessment. It is from these portions\nof his discussion that we get \u201cClifford's Other\nPrinciple.\u201d\n\nMany early ethicists of belief modeled their accounts on deontological\nethical theories that tend to formulate principles synchronically.\nRecently, however, virtue epistemologists have emphasized what they\ntake to be the diachronic character of our fundamental doxastic\nobligations, and suggest that synchronic principles requiring\nsufficient evidence for a belief at a time are plausibly viewed as\nunderwritten by more fundamental diachronic principles enjoining the\ncultivation of virtuous intellectual character (Zagzebski 1996,\nRoberts and Wood 2007, Sosa 2007, Audi 2008b).\n4.3 Evidence and its possession\n\nCrucial to any theory in the ethics of belief\u2014and especially an\nEvidentialist theory\u2014will be some account of the nature of\nevidence itself. Some philosophers construe evidence in terms\nof demonstrative proof, others in terms of objective and/or subjective\nprobability, and others simply in terms of anything that belief is\nresponsive to (see the entry on\n evidence).\n A fully articulate Evidentialism will also provide an account of how\nevidence supports belief (see the entry on the\n epistemic basing relation),\n and of what it is to have or possess such\nevidence.\n\nIt will also, perhaps, say something about whether there can be\nevidence (arguments) in favor of having a belief that p or\nbringing about the belief that p, in addition to evidence in\nfavor of p itself (see Reisner 2008). It will presumably also\nhave something to say about disagreement between epistemic peers, and\nthe impact that such disagreement can have on our conception of the\ndoxastic norms, especially if the disagreement is not based on a\ndifference in evidence (van Inwagen 1996, Kelly 2005). Finally, it\nmight take a stand on the more general issue of how higher-order\nevidence interacts with first-order evidence. For example: in the case\nof peer disagreement, knowing that a peer disagrees with you is a\npiece of higher-order evidence regarding your first-order belief.\n\nWith respect to reflective access conditions, it was noted earlier\nthat Evidentialists cannot require that a rational subject\nalways base beliefs on sufficient evidence that she knows or\njustifiably believes she has, for fear of an infinite regress. If that\nis correct, then another less demanding sort of principle must be in\nthe offing, one according to which at least some beliefs can simply be\nheld on the basis of sufficient evidence, regardless of whether the\nsubject has any beliefs about that evidence.\n\nOn the issue of evidence-possession generally: if we regard evidence\nas wholly constituted by mental states (experiences, beliefs,\nmemories, etc.), then an account of what it is to\n\u201cpossess\u201d evidence will be relatively\nstraightforward\u2014we must simply have these mental states. If\nevidence is not merely in the head, so to speak, then the possession\ncondition in Evidentialist norms may turn out to be quite complex.\nWhat is our evidence for the belief that \u201cit's raining\u201d?\nIs it our awareness or experience of something, such as the street's\nbeing wet? Or is it simply the street's being wet? When asked why we\nbelieve that it is raining, we typically say something like\n\u201cbecause the street is wet.\u201d Is this merely shorthand or\ndoes it say something about the nature of evidence? (For arguments\nthat extra-mental facts in the world often constitute evidence, see\nMcDowell 1994 and Ginsborg 2007; for further discussion see Williamson\n2000 and Dancy 2000, ch.6).\n5. Varieties of Evidentialism\n\nIn light of the fact that there are different types of value\nunderwriting different types of obligation, there must also be\ndifferent types of Evidentialism: prudential, epistemic, and moral at\nthe very least.\n5.1 Prudential evidentialism\n\nStrict prudential Evidentialism doesn't enjoy much of a\nfollowing; indeed, as with most strict forms of Evidentialism, it is\nhard to see how it could be motivated. Perhaps it is prudent in\ngeneral to follow one's evidence, but there will always be cases\nin which prudential considerations push in the direction of playing\nfast and loose with the evidence. Wouldn't it be better for the\ngrief-stricken widower to believe that his wife is enjoying life in\nheaven, or for the devoted spouse to fight off the belief that her\nhusband is unfaithful, even though she regularly finds lipstick on his\ncollar?\n\nOne move that the prudential Evidentialist can make in response to\nsuch objections is to adopt the doxastic analogue of rule\nconsequentialism. Even if there are particular cases in which it is\nimprudent to follow one's evidence, the general rule that one\nshould believe on the basis of, and in proportion to, sufficient\nevidence in one's possession produces the best distribution of\nprudential outcomes overall.\n\nThis kind of moderate prudential Evidentialism can handle a lot of\ncommon counterexamples, but there is still the concern that entire\nclasses of beliefs\u2014rather than individual\ninstances\u2014violate the principle and yet seem to produce more\nbeneficial overall results. For instance, wouldn't it be better all\naround if each of us were as a rule to think more highly of\none another's worth, intentions, and capacities than our evidence\nactually supports?\n\nIn response, it might be claimed that the source of the prudential\nvalue of always believing on sufficient evidence is that it tends to\nresult in our having knowledge. If that were right, then there would\nbe a clear connection between prudential and epistemic norms (see\n\u00a72.4 above and \u00a75.3 below). The challenge for such a\nposition, however, is to show that justification or knowledge adds\nsomething of genuine prudential value that mere true belief\nlacks.\n5.2 Moral evidentialism\n\nStrict moral Evidentialism is unlikely to be attractive to anyone but\nthe most zealous Cliffordian. In its more moderate forms, however,\nmoral Evidentialism is much more attractive and widespread. \u201cYou\nsimply shouldn't believe that about your\nfriend!\u201d\u2014expressed in a context where the friend's\ndisloyalty is not conclusively supported by the evidence\u2014sounds\nto many ears like the expression of a plausible moral obligation (see\nWood 2002, ch. 1\u20133).\n\nMoral rightness and wrongness is analyzed in many different ways, of\ncourse; a moral Evidentialist will presumably either adopt one of\nthose analyses and develop her position accordingly, or show that the\nethics of belief swings free of debates between deontologists,\nconsequentialists, virtue theorists, and the like. No matter which\ntheory of moral rightness and wrongness she adopts, however, there\nwill be the usual questions to settle about whether there are\nthresholds of harm beyond which Evidentialist principles are\nsuspended, even in a deontological context, about whether the\nfundamental objects of moral appraisal in the doxastic context are\nacts or rules, and about whether there is a \u2018unity\u2019 to the\nmoral as well as the intellectual virtues. Again, it is an open and\ninteresting question whether these issues need to be dealt with\ndifferently in an ethics of belief than they are in an ethics of\naction.\n5.3 Epistemic evidentialism\n\nBy far the most influential and widespread variety of Evidentialism is\nepistemic (see Chisholm 1957, Adler 2002, Conee and Feldman 2004, Shah\n2006). The central thesis of epistemic Evidentialism is that the norms\nof evidence governing belief are somehow based in the nature and aims\nof theoretical reason itself. To believe on insufficient evidence is\nat bottom an epistemic failure\u2014a failure to use our\ncognitive faculties in such a way that we are likely to acquire\nsignificant knowledge and avoid significant unjustified belief. Some\nphilosophers in this tradition also defend Locke's proportionality\nthesis according to which our degree of belief must be in proportion\nto the strength of our evidence (see White 2005). \n\nA major challenge facing proponents of epistemic Evidentialism is to\nfind an adequate motivation for it: if there are not sufficient\nprudential or moral grounds for the obligation to believe on\nsufficient evidence, then what is the source of its normativity? In\nresponse to the challenge, epistemic Evidentialists take a number of\ndifferent tacks. Some argue that the norms are underwritten by\nnecessary, conceptual truths. On this view, the very concept\nof belief reveals that it is a truth-aimed attitude that is only\nproperly formed on the basis of sufficient evidence in the possession\nof the subject. Thus an attitude that is not formed in this way is\neither not a genuine belief at all, or at best a deficient instance of\nit (see Adler 2002, Textor 2004).\n\nOther epistemic Evidentialists argue that doxastic norms arise not\nfrom analysis of the concept of belief, but rather from reflection on\nthe fact that our belief-forming faculties are simply set up to be\nsensitive to evidence. The faculties of perception, memory, testimony,\nintrospection, reasoning, and so on, typically generate beliefs on the\nbasis of sufficient evidence, and we usually regard these faculties as\nmalfunctioning, maladjusted, or misused when they generate beliefs in\nother ways. Pieces of apparent evidence\u2014epistemic reasons,\nbroadly-speaking\u2014reliably provide us with important information\nabout the world, and we have evolved to be sensitive to such reasons\nin our quest to survive and flourish.\n\nNote that the epistemic Evidentialist does not hold that the\nacquisition of significant truth\u2014even truth that promotes\nsurvival\u2014is the only relevant consideration in this region: our\nbelief-forming faculties are not mere thermometers or\nmotion-detectors. The idea is rather that, as evidence-sensitive\nbelievers, we don't merely want to believe significant\ntruths; rather, we want to have good grounds for taking propositions\nto be true, and to base our belief on those grounds (Feldman 2000;\nthough again see David 2001). This putative fact is then taken to\nunderwrite a norm: we ought to seek not just true belief but\nknowledge, or, more specifically, we ought to seek\nwidespread significant knowledge without widespread significant\nerror. To seek knowledge in this way is, among other things, to\nseek to have sufficient evidence for true beliefs and to base them on\nthat evidence.\n\nAnother kind of defense of epistemic Evidentialism says that the\ncentral Evidentialist principle\u2014that we ought to believe on the\nbasis of sufficient evidence that is in our possession\u2014is not an\nanalytic truth drawn from the concept of belief, and not a\n\u2018functional norm\u2019 arising from reflection on the way our\nfaculties are set up or designed, but rather a synthetic principle\nthat we simply rationally intuit in the course of reflecting on\nconcepts and thought-experiments. This approach seems coherent and in\nsome ways attractive, though it has not found many defenders in the\nliterature.\n6. Varieties of Non-Evidentialism\n\nWe have already seen that there are any number of ways in which one\ncan fail to be a strict Evidentialist. One might hold, for instance,\nthat belief need not always be based on evidence (though of\ncourse the moderate Evidentialist could agree with that), or that\nbelief requires evidence but its degree needn't be\nproportioned to the strength of the evidence, or that belief\nrequires evidence but need not be based on that evidence, or\nthat belief requires that there be evidence even if the\nsubject doesn't possess that evidence. No doubt there are\nother ways as well, and the question of whether a particular\nphilosopher counts as an Evidentialist will ultimately hang on how\nEvidentialism itself is construed.\n\nMost important for present purposes, however, is to note that the fact\nthat someone is not a prudential Evidentialist, say, does not\nentail that she is a Non-Evidentialist for prudential\nreasons\u2014or for any other reasons. Indeed, she might still be an\nEvidentialist, but for moral or epistemic rather than prudential\nreasons. As I will use the term, being a Non-Evidentialist\nwith respect to a certain domain of beliefs requires, as a necessary\ncondition, that one is not an Evidentialist of any sort about that\ndomain of beliefs.\n\nI suggested earlier that a natural place to draw the line between\nmoderate Evidentialists and Non-Evidentialists about a domain of\nbeliefs rests on the question of whether belief on the basis of\ninsufficient evidence is ever reasonably required. Are we\never obliged to believe, even in the absence of sufficient evidence?\nStrict and moderate Evidentialists will say no, Non-Evidentialists\nwill say yes. Naturally, the reasons that motivate this putative\nrequirement will be different according to different types of\nNon-Evidentialism. Here the focus will be on the three main types of\nNon-Evidentialism that are prevalent among contemporary philosophers:\nPractical Non-Evidentialism (which includes what is sometimes called\n\u201cpragmatism\u201d), Conservativism, and Fideism.\n6.1 Practical non-evidentialism\n\nAs noted above, William James famously sniffs at the impracticable\nstringency of Clifford's Principle, advocating instead the more\nliberal policy that we sometimes have the \u201cright to\nbelieve\u201d even when we lack sufficient evidence (and even when we\nknow that we lack it). In places, James goes further and\nsuggests that in certain cases\u2014especially cases involving\nreligious and moral belief\u2014it is not merely permitted but\npositively commendable or even required that we\nbelieve on insufficient evidence.\n\nWhen I look at the religious question as it really puts itself to\nconcrete men, and when I think of all the possibilities which both\npractically and theoretically it involves, then this command that we\nshall put a stopper on our heart, instincts, and courage, and\nwait\u2014acting of course meanwhile more or less as if\nreligion were not true\u2014till doomsday, or till such time\nas our intellect and sense working together may have raked in evidence\nenough,\u2014this command, I say, seems to me the queerest idol ever\nmanufactured in the philosophic cave. (1896, 11)\n\n\nWe saw earlier that there are difficult conceptual and psychological\nproblems facing an ethics of belief that says, quite strictly, that we\nmust always and only believe what is prudentially beneficial. Thus\nwhile pragmatism is sometimes characterized casually as the view that\nwe should believe whatever \u201cworks,\u201d most self-described\npragmatists are very careful to specify the conditions under which a\nsubject can reasonably depart from, ignore, or go beyond her evidence\n(see\n pragmatism).\n These conditions typically involve the absence of really compelling\nevidence; thus, as James reminds his reader, pragmatic belief is not\nsimply wild-eyed believing \u201cwhat you know ain't true\u201d\n(1896, 29). Pragmatists also typically require the existence of some\nsort of exigency or \u201cpassional\u201d interest on the part of\nthe subject that makes suspension of belief in that context impossible\n(or at least exceedingly ill-advised). We saw earlier how James\ndefines a \u201cgenuine option\u201d in an effort to specify these\nconditions.\n\nThe emphasis on the \u201cprimacy of the practical\u201d in James\nwas clearly anticipated by earlier ethicists of belief. Blaise Pascal\nfamously argues in the Pens\u00e9es that wager-like\nreasoning should lead us to set the goal of believing in God; thus his\nfocus tends to be less on the moral or epistemic and more on the\nprudential motives for belief (Pascal 1670, H\u00e1jek 2003, Jordan\n2006; see also the entries on\n Pascal,\n Pascal's Wager, and\n pragmatic arguments and belief in God).\n For Immanuel Kant, by contrast, considerations that can justify\nbelief (or faith) in the absence of sufficient theoretical evidence\nare typically (though not exclusively) moral. If, for\ninstance, there is no sufficient evidence one way or the other for a\ncertain proposition p (the proposition, say, that the human\nwill is incompatibilistically free), and if one has set a moral end\nthat requires one to take a stand on the truth of p, and if\nany evidence that one does have points in the direction of the truth\nof p, then one is permitted (and sometimes even required) to\ntake p to be true. This \u2018taking-to-be-true\u2019\n(German: \u2018F\u00fcrwahrhalten\u2019) is thereby\njustified on \u201cmoral\u201d rather than \u201ctheoretical\u201d\ngrounds, and it counts as \u201cbelief\u201d (Glaube) or\n\u201cacceptance\u201d (Annehmung) rather than\n\u201cknowledge\u201d (Wissen) (Kant 1781/1787, Chignell\n2007).\n\nA convenient label that captures both broadly pragmatist and broadly\nKantian theories is Practical Non-Evidentialism, where the\npragmatic/prudential and the moral are the two main species of\n\u201cpractical\u201d value (for more on moral reasons for belief\nand whether they count as evidence see Pace 2010; for a survey of the\ndebate about pragmatic reasons for belief see Reisner 2017).\n6.2 Conservative non-evidentialism\n\nConservatism (sometimes also called dogmatism,\nthough the latter is usually thought to be a view about perceptual\nbelief in particular; see Pryor 2000, White 2006) is the view that one\nis prima facie justified in believing that p if in\nfact one does believe that p (Harman 1986, Owens 2000).\nAnother version of it says that one is prima facie justified\nin believing that p if it seems to one that p is\ntrue (Huemer 2007a) or at least perceptually seems to one\nthat p is true (Pryor 2000). In order to be all things\nconsidered justified on either of these conservatisms, one must be\naware of no undefeated defeaters for p. But the absence of\nundefeated defeaters for p, even if one is aware of it, is\nnot positive evidence for p, and any\n\u201cimpulsional\u201d urge towards p or seeming that\np is true is not the kind of evidence that Evidentialists\nthink we should seek (see Conee and Feldman 2004, ch. 3; for\nimpulsional evidence see Plantinga 1993, 192). So on at least most\naccounts of what \u201cevidence\u201d is, conservatism is an\nimportant kind of Non-Evidentialism according to which some justified\nbeliefs\u2014the immediately justified ones\u2014are not based on\nsufficient evidence.\n\nConservatism is regarded by some philosophers as a useful tool against\nskepticism (Christensen 1994, Huemer 2007a), and its\n\u201cdogmatic\u201d flavor is sometimes made more palatable by\ncombining it with various moderate or localized Evidentialisms. Thus,\nfor example, conservatism about beliefs that go into the foundation of\nour knowledge structure (including beliefs about basic mathematical or\nmoral truths) might very naturally be combined with a kind of\nEvidentialism about beliefs that are not in the foundation (for more\non foundationalism in epistemology, see\n foundationalist theories of epistemic justification).\n\nNote that conservatives need not say that any of the beliefs we have\nare infallible or incapable of being undermined. Indeed, they might be\nquite open to the fallibilist thought that our current justified\nbeliefs can be defeated (either rebutted or undercut) by new evidence.\nSo the view doesn't promote belief that is \u201cdogmatic\u201d or\n\u201cconservative\u201din some disparaging sense: it says merely\nthat some beliefs that we have, or some \u201cimpelling\u201d\nbeliefs, needn't be based on positive evidential (or practical)\nsupport in order to be justified (Harman 1986, Lycan 1988, Chisholm\n1989, McGrath 2007).\n6.3 Fideistic non-evidentialism\n\nA third Non-Evidentialist position in the ethics of belief, similar to\nbut distinct from dogmatism, is sometimes called fideism,\nthough it needn't have anything to do with religious doctrine in\nparticular. According to the fideist, we can legitimately hold\npropositions on faith without having any evidence for them,\nwithout feeling impelled towards them, and even in the face of strong\nevidence against them (note that this is just one way of defining\n\u201cfideism,\u201d see the entry on\n fideism\n for others). Someone might hold on the basis of faith, for instance,\nthat there has been at least one bodily resurrection at some point in\nthe past, even though he has never witnessed such a thing first-hand,\nand his best scientific, testimonial, and everyday inductive evidence\nconstitutes a powerful case against it.\n\nFideism of this radical sort is not itself required by most religions,\nbut is typically associated with religious thinkers like Tertullian in\nthe ancient period (perhaps unfairly: see Sider 1980), and Kierkegaard\n(1846) in the modern (also perhaps unfairly: see Evans 1998). Apart\nfrom wearing its irrationality on its sleeve, fideism is vulnerable to\npsychological objections about the lack of direct control over belief.\nIf belief just is an attitude that necessarily responds to\nperceived evidence with a positive \u2018direction of fit,\u2019 it\nis hard to see how a well-functioning subject could believe that\np in the face of strong evidence that not-p.\nConsider someone who has normal sensory faculties and who, despite\nstrong perceptual and testimonial evidence to the contrary, repeatedly\ndeclares\u2014without claiming to have any hidden evidence\u2014that\nthere is, say, a huge abyss opening up in front of him. It would take\na very long time for us to become convinced that he really\nbelieves that there is an abyss in front of him. But if, in the end,\nwe are convinced by his actions and speech that he has this belief,\nand we know that his sensory faculties are functioning properly, then\nwe will probably think the belief is the product of an undesirable and\npartly involuntary state such as self-deception, wish-fulfillment, or\nparanoia. We won't think that he has simply chosen to believe.\n\nA more moderate sort of fideism would say that we are permitted to\nform a \u201cfaith\u201d-based belief only if the evidence regarding\nthe proposition in question is not compelling either way, or is absent\naltogether. Only under those circumstances can we (directly or\nindirectly) make a \u201cleap of faith\u201d into belief (Adams\n1987). Typically, however, those who have recommended \u201cleaps of\nfaith\u201d have cited pragmatic or moral grounds for those leaps,\nand so given the taxonomy we have so far, they would ultimately count\nas practical non-Evidentialists rather than bona fide fideists.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the claim is that in the complete absence of\npractical or theoretical reasons in favor, a subject is still\npermitted to adopt a certain belief, then the view seems to have\nabandoned aspirations to developing a principled position, and is no\nlonger obviously an \u201cethics\u201d of belief. This is not a\nknockdown argument against that kind of fideism, of course: it may be\nthat such a fideist can give reasons to think that trying to formulate\nan ethics of belief is an ill-conceived project in the first\nplace.\n\nA final alternative for the fideist is to admit that he is not really\nfocused on belief at all, but is rather trying to make room for\nanother kind of positive propositional attitude that is not guided by\nevidence. Many philosophers and religious people who embrace the\nfideist label construe \u201cfaith\u201d (Latin: fides) as\nsomething different from belief\u2014hope, perhaps, or something like\n\u201cacceptance\u201d (see \u00a77 and the entry on\n fideism).\n On such a conception, faith that p might very well be able\nrationally to co-exist in the same psychology with a lot of evidence\nfor not-p.\n7. The ethics of acceptance\n\nThis last point shows that Evidentialism about belief\u2014even of a\nstrict and uncompromising sort\u2014can be combined with\nNon-Evidentialism about some other positive, categorical propositional\nattitudes in order to make it seem less stern (see Audi 2008a for a\nlist of possible meanings of \u201cfaith\u201d). Perhaps the most\nprominent candidate here is acceptance conceived as a\npositive categorical attitude towards a proposition that is by\ndefinition voluntary and figures significantly in our deliberation,\naction, argumentation, and assertion. Some philosophers focus on the\nrole that acceptance plays in scientific inquiry, theory-construction,\nand decision theory (van Fraasen 1984, Stalnaker 1987, Cohen 1992).\nOthers focus on the role that it plays in ethical, juridical,\nreligious, and everyday contexts (Bratman 1992, Cohen 1992, Alston\n1996, Audi 2008a). A warning is in order here: acceptance is typically\na technical notion and characterizations of its nature and ethics\ndiffer radically in the literature. There is also some dispute about\nwhether acceptance is able to play the various roles that its\nadvocates intend (Radford 1990, Maher 1990, Moore 1994).\n\nThe ethicist of belief who wants to soften or supplement her view by\nappealing to some notion of permissible acceptance would need to say\nwhat acceptance is, how the two sorts of attitude differ, what sorts\nof norms govern each, and how they interact in a single subject. One\nof the main advantages of a hybrid view like this is that acceptance\nis usually taken to be by definition voluntary, and thus it\nis much easier to see how a genuine \u201cethics\u201d (complete\nwith praise and blame ascriptions) could be built around it. As we saw\nearlier, a notion of acceptance (as \u201cfaith\u201d) is the sort\nof thing that a fideist might want to appeal to against those who say\nthat one can't just decide to believe that p in the face of\nstrong opposing evidence. A moderate fideist, by contrast, might argue\nthat we are only permitted to accept that p if we lack\nstrong evidence about p either way. This is still\nconsistent with our having weak evidence for not-p,\nand even a (weakly held) belief that not-p.\n",
