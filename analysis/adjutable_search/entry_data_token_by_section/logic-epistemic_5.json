    "main_text": "The Modal Approach to Knowledge || Kripke Models and The Indistinguishability Interpretation of Knowledge\n2.4 Kripke Models and The Indistinguishability Interpretation of Knowledge\n\nSince the 1960s Kripke models, defined below, have served as\nthe basis of the most widely used semantics for all varieties of modal\nlogic. The use of Kripke models in the representation of epistemic\nconcepts involves taking a philosophical stance with respect to those\nconcepts. One widespread interpretation, especially in theoretical\neconomics and theoretical computer science, understands knowledge in\nterms of informational indistinguishability between possible worlds.\nWhat we will refer to here as the indistinguishability\ninterpretation goes back to Lehmann (1984), and Aumann (1976) has\nan equivalent partition-based framework.\n\nAs the indistinguishability interpretation concerns knowledge, but not\nbelief, we will be working with a language without belief operators.\nTherefore, let the language \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) be given by the\nBackus-Naur form \n\\[\\varphi::=p\\mid \\neg\\varphi\\mid (\\varphi\\wedge\\varphi)\\mid K_{a}\\varphi\\text{ for } p\\in \\Atom.\\]\n\n\nAs we shall see, the indistinguishability interpretation involves very\nstringent requirements in order for something to qualify as knowledge.\nWe introduce it here for pedagogical purposes, putting the formal\ndetails of the interpretation in place so as to introduce and explain\nrelatively less extreme positions thereafter.\n\nConsider again the case of Zoe, the hen, and the dog. The example\ninvolves two propositions, which we will identify with the formal\natoms:\n\n\np read as \u201cthere is a hen in the yard\u201d.\n\nand\n\nq read as \u201cthere is a dog in the yard\u201d.\n\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that for the purposes of our formalization of\nthis scenario, these two are the only propositions of\ninterest. We are restricting our attention to \\(\\Atom=\\{p,q\\}\\). In\nearly presentations of epistemic logic and in much of standard\nepistemic logic at present, all the atoms of interest are\nincluded from the outset. Obviously, this is an idealized scenario. It\nis important to notice what this approach leaves out. Considerations\nthat are not captured in this way include the appearance of novel\natoms; the idea that other atomic propositions might be introduced at\nsome future state via some process of learning for example, or the\nquestion of an agent\u2019s awareness of propositions; the scenario\nin which an agent might be temporarily unaware of some atom\ndue to some psychological or other factor (see\n Section 5\n for references to so-called awareness logic). For now, the\nmain point is that standard epistemic logic begins with the assumption\nthat the set Atom exhausts the space of propositions for the\nagent.\n\nWith two atoms, there are four different ways a world could\nconsistently be. We can depict each by a box:\n\n\n\n\nThe four boxes may be formally represented by a set\n\\(W=\\{w_{1},w_{2},w_{3},w_{4}\\}\\), typically called a set of\npossible worlds. Each world is further\nlabeled with the atoms true at that world. They are labeled by a\nfunction V, the valuation. The\nvaluation specifies which atoms are true at each world in the\nfollowing way: Given an atom p, \\(V(p)\\) is the subset of\nworlds at which p is\n true.[2]\n That \\(w_{1}\\) is labeled with p and q thus means that\n\\(w_{1}\\in V(p)\\) and \\(w_{1}\\in V(q)\\). In the illustration,\n\\(V(p)=\\{w_{1},w_{2}\\}\\) and \\(V(q)=\\{w_{1},w_{3}\\}\\).\n\nFor presentational purposes, assume that there really is a hen in the\nyard, but no dog. Then \\(w_{2}\\) would represent the\nactual world of the model. In illustrations,\nthe actual world is commonly highlighted:\n\n\n\n\nNow, assume that the hen is always clucking, but that the dog never\nbarks, and that although Zoe has acute hearing, she cannot see the\nyard. Then there are certain possible worlds that Zoe cannot\ndistinguish: possible ways things may be which she cannot\ntell apart. For example, being in the world with only a hen \\((p,\\neg\nq)\\), Zoe cannot tell if she is in the world with both hen and dog\n\\((p,q)\\): her situation is such that Zoe is aware of two ways things\ncould be but her information does not allow her to eliminate\neither.\n\nTo illustrate that one possible world cannot be distinguished from\nanother, an arrow is typically drawn from the former to the\nlatter:\n\n\n\n\nHere, arrows represent a binary relation on possible worlds.\nIn modal logic in general, it is referred to as the\naccessibility relation. Under the\nindistinguishability interpretation of epistemic logic, it is\nsometimes called the indistinguishability\nrelation. Formally, denote the relation \\(R_{a}\\), with\nthe subscript showing the relation belongs to agent a. The\nrelation is a subset of the set of ordered pairs of possible\nworlds, \\(\\{(w,w')\\colon w,w'\\in W\\}\\). One world w\n\u201cpoints\u201d to another \\(w'\\) if \\((w,w')\\in R_{a}\\). In this\ncase, \\(w'\\) is said to be accessible\n(indistinguishable) from w. In the literature, this is\noften written \\(wR_{a}w'\\) or \\(R_{a}ww'\\). The notation\n\u2018\\(w'\\in R_{a}(w)\\)\u2019 is also common: the set \\(R_{a}(w)\\)\nis then the worlds accessible from w, i.e., \n\\[R_{a}(w):=\\{w'\\in W:(w,w')\\in R_{a}\\}.\\]\n\n\nA final note: the set \\(\\{(w,w')\\colon w,w'\\in W\\}\\) is often written\n\\(W\\times W\\), the Cartesian product of W with\nitself.\n\nFor \\(R_{a}\\) to faithfully represent a relation of\nindistinguishability, what worlds should it relate? If Zoe was plunged\nin \\(w_{1}\\) for example, could she tell that she is not in \\(w_{2}\\)?\nNo: the relation of indistinguishability is\nsymmetric\u2014if one cannot tell a from b,\nneither can one tell b from a. That a relation is\nsymmetric is typically drawn by omitting arrow-heads altogether or by\nputting them in both directions:\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the remaining worlds are indistinguishable? Given that the\nhen is always clucking, Zoe has information that allows her to\ndistinguish \\(w_{1}\\) and \\(w_{2}\\) from \\(w_{3}\\) and \\(w_{4}\\) and\nvice versa, cf. symmetry. Hence, no arrows between these. The\nworlds \\(w_{3}\\) and \\(w_{4}\\) are indistinguishable. This brings us\nto the following representation:\n\n\n\n\nSince no information will ever allow Zoe to distinguish something from\nitself, any possible world is thus related to itself and the\nindistinguishability relation is reflexive:\n\n\n\n\nThe standard interpretation of the Zoe example in terms of a possible\nworlds model is now complete. Before turning to a general presentation\nof the indistinguishability interpretation, let us look at what Zoe\nknows.\n\nRecall the informal modal semantics of the knowledge operator from\nabove:\n\n\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) is true in world w if, and only if,\n\\(\\varphi\\) is true in every world \\(w'\\) compatible with the\ninformation a has at w.\n\n\nTo approach a formal definition, take \u2018\\(w\\vDash\\varphi\\)\u2019\nto mean that \\(\\varphi\\) is true in world w. Thus we can,\ndefine truth of \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) in w by\n\n\n\\(w\\vDash K_{a}\\varphi\\) iff \\(w'\\vDash\\varphi\\) for all \\(w'\\) such\nthat \\(wR_{a}w'\\).\n\n\nThis definition states that a knows \\(\\varphi\\) in world\nw if, and only if, \\(\\varphi\\) is the case in all the worlds\n\\(w'\\) which a cannot distinguish from w.\n\nSo, where does that leave Zoe? First off, the definition allows us to\nevaluate her knowledge in each of the worlds, but seeing as \\(w_{2}\\)\nis the actual world, it is the world of interest. Let a denote\nZoe, here are some examples of what we can say about Zoe\u2019s\nknowledge in \\(w_{2}\\):\n\n\\(w_{2}\\vDash K_{a}p\\). Zoe knows that the hen is in the yard as\nall the worlds indistinguishable from \\(w_{2}\\) that would be\n\\(w_{1}\\) and \\(w_{2}\\) make p true.\n\\(w_{2}\\vDash\\neg K_{a}q\\). Zoe does not know the dog is in the\nyard, as one of the indistinguishable worlds in fact \\(w_{2}\\) itself\nmakes q false.\n\\(w_{2}\\vDash K_{a}K_{a}p\\). Zoe knows that she knows p\nbecause\n\n\n \\(w_{2}\\vDash K_{a}p\\) (cf. 1.) and\n \\(w_{1}\\vDash K_{a}p\\).\n\n\\(w_{2}\\vDash K_{a}\\neg K_{a}q\\). Zoe knows that she does not know\nq because\n\n\n \\(w_{2}\\vDash\\neg K_{a}q\\) (cf. 2.) and \n \\(w_{1}\\vDash\\neg K_{a}q\\).\n\n\n\nWe could say a lot more about Zoe\u2019s knowledge: every formula of\nthe epistemic language without belief operators may be evaluated in\nthe model. It thus represents all Zoe\u2019s higher-order information\nabout her own knowledge of which points 3. and 4. are the first\nexamples.\n\nOne last ingredient is required before we can state the\nindistinguishability interpretation in its full generality. In the\nexample above, it was shown that the indistinguishability relation was\nboth symmetric and reflexive. Formally, these\nproperties may be defined as follows:\n\n\nDefinition: A binary relation \\(R\\subseteq W\\times\nW\\) is\n\nreflexive iff for all \\(w\\in\nW,wRw\\),\nsymmetric iff for all \\(w,w'\\in W,\\) if\n\\(wRw'\\), then \\(w'Rw\\).\n\n\n\nThe missing ingredient is then the relational property of\ntransitivity. \u2018Shorter than\u2019 is an example of a\ntransitive relation: Let x be shorter than y, and let\ny be shorter than z. Then x must be shorter than\nz. So, given \\(w_{1},w_{2}\\) and \\(w_{3}\\), if the relation\nR holds between \\(w_{1}\\) and \\(w_{2}\\) and between \\(w_{2}\\)\nand \\(w_{3}\\), then the arrow between \\(w_{1}\\) and \\(w_{3}\\) is the\nconsequence of requiring the relation to be transitive:\n\n\n\n\nFormally, transitivity is defined as follows:\n\n\nDefinition: A binary relation \\(R\\subseteq W\\times\nW\\) is transitive iff for all \\(w,w',w''\\in\nW,\\) if \\(wRw'\\) and \\(w'Rw''\\), then \\(wRw''\\)\n\n\nA relation that is both reflexive, symmetric and transitive is called\nan equivalence relation.\n\nWith all the components in place, let us now define the Kripke\nmodel:\n\n\nDefinition: A Kripke model\nfor \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) is a tuple \\(M=(W,R,V)\\) where\n\nW is a non-empty set of possible worlds,\nR is a binary relation on W, and\n\\(V\\colon \\Atom \\longrightarrow\\mathcal{P}(W)\\) is a\nvaluation.\n\n\n\nIn the definition, \u2018\\(\\mathcal{P}(W)\\)\u2019 denotes the\npowerset of W: It consists of all the subsets of\nW. Hence \\(V(p)\\), the valuation of atom p in the model\nM, is some subset of the possible worlds: Those where p\nis true. In this general definition, R can be any relation on\nW.\n\nTo specify which world is actual, one last parameter is added to the\nmodel. When the actual world is specified a Kripke model is commonly\ncalled pointed:\n\n\nDefinition: A pointed Kripke\nmodel for \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) is a pair \\((M,w)\\)\nwhere\n\n\\(M=(W,R,V)\\) is a Kripke model, and\n\\(w\\in W\\).\n\n\n\nFinally, we may formally define the semantics that was somewhat\nloosely expressed above. This is done by defining a relation between\npointed Kripke models and the formulas of the formal language. The\nrelation is denoted \u2018\\(\\vDash\\)\u2019 and is often called the\nsatisfaction relation.\n\nThe definition then goes as follows:\n\n\nDefinition: Let \\(M=(W,R_{a},V)\\) be a Kripke model\nfor \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) and let \\((M,w)\\) be a pointed Kripke model.\nThen for all \\(p\\in \\Atom\\) and all\n\\(\\varphi,\\psi\\in\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\)\n \n\\[ \\begin{align}\n(M,w)&\\vDash p & \\textrm{ iff }& w\\in V(p)\\\\\n (M,w)&\\vDash\\neg\\varphi& \\textrm{ iff }& \\textrm{not } (M,w)\\vDash\\varphi\\\\\n (M,w)&\\vDash(\\varphi\\wedge\\psi)& \\textrm{ iff }& (M,w)\\vDash\\varphi \\textrm{ and }(M,w)\\vDash\\psi\\\\\n (M,w)&\\vDash K_{a}\\varphi &\\textrm{ iff }& (M,w')\\vDash\\varphi \\textrm{ for all } w'\\in W \\textrm{ such that } wR_{a}w'. \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\n\nThe formula \\(\\varphi\\) is satisfied in the\npointed model \\((M,w)\\) iff \\((M,w)\\vDash\\varphi\\).\n\n\nIn full generality, the indistinguishability interpretation holds that\nfor \\(K_{a}\\) to capture knowledge, the relation \\(R_{a}\\) must be an\nequivalence relation. A pointed Kripke model for which this is\nsatisfied is often referred to as an epistemic\nstate. In epistemic states, the relation is denoted by a\ntilde with a subscript: \\(\\sim_{a}\\).\n\nGiven pointed Kripke models and the indistinguishability\ninterpretation, we have a semantic specification of one concept of\nknowledge. With this approach, we can build models of situations\ninvolving knowledge as we did with the toy example of Zoe and the\nhens. We can use these models to determine what the agent does or does\nnot know. We also have the formal foundations in place to begin asking\nquestions concerning how the agent\u2019s knowledge or uncertainty\ndevelops when it receives new information, a topic studied in\n dynamic epistemic logic.\n\nWe may also ask more general questions concerning the concept of\nknowledge modeled using pointed Kripke models with\nindistinguishability relations: Instead of looking at a particular\nmodel at the time and asking which formulas the model makes true, we\ncan ask which general principles all such models agree on.\n",
