    "main_text": "Peer Disagreements || The Total Evidence View\n5.4 The Total Evidence View\n\n\nLike the Justificationist View, the Total Evidence View lies somewhere\nbetween the Steadfast View and the Equal Weight View. The Total\nEvidence View claims that in cases of peer disagreement, one is\njustified in believing what one\u2019s total evidence supports (Kelly\n2010). While this might sound like something of a truism, central to\nthe view is an additional claim about the relation between first-order\nevidence and higher-order evidence. Let\u2019s first revisit the\nEqual Weight View. According to the Equal Weight View, in a peer\ndisagreement where one individual has a 0.7 degree of belief that\n\\(P\\) and the other has a 0.3 degree of belief that \\(P\\), both peers\nshould split the difference and adopt a 0.5 degree of belief that\n\\(P\\). On the Equal Weight View, then, the attitude that you are\njustified in adopting toward the disputed proposition is entirely\ndetermined by the higher-order evidence. The justified attitude is the\nmean between the two peer attitudes, which ignores what their shared\nfirst-order evidence supports. According to the Total Evidence View,\nthis is a mistake \u2013 the first-order evidence must also factor in\nto what the peers are reasonable in believing. Such an incorporation\nof the first-order evidence is what leads to the name \u201cTotal\nEvidence View\u201d.\n\n\nKelly gives the following case to motivate the view:\n\nBootstrapping. At time \\(t_0\\), each of us has access to a\nsubstantial, fairly complicated body of evidence. On the whole this\nevidence tells against hypothesis \\(H\\): given our evidence, the\nuniquely rational credence for us to have in \\(H\\) is 0.3. However, as\nit happens, both of us badly mistake the import of this evidence: you\nadopt a 0.7 degree of belief toward \\(H\\) while I adopt a 0.9 degree\nof belief. At time \\(t_1\\), we meet and compare notes and we then\nsplit the difference and converge on a 0.8 degree of belief. (Kelly\n2010, 125\u2013126.)\n\n\nWhile the Equal Weight View seems to be committed to the peers being\njustified in adopting the 0.8 degree of belief in \\(H\\), Kelly finds such a\nconsequence implausible. After all, both peers badly misjudged the\nfirst-order evidence! This argument can be seen as an argument against\nIndependence. In these cases, the disputed first-order\nevidence can exert an \u2018upwards epistemic push\u201d to mitigate\nthe impact of the higher-order evidence. Kelly takes Independence on\ndirectly with the following case:\n\nHolocaust Denier. I possess a great deal of evidence that the\nHolocaust occurred, and I judge it to strongly support that\nhypothesis. Having adopted a high amount of credence that the\nHolocaust occurred, I encounter an individual who denies that the\nHolocaust ever occurred (because he is grossly ignorant of the\nevidence). (Kelly 2013b, 40)\n\nIndependence claims that my reasons for believing \\(P\\) cannot\nbe used to discount my interlocutor\u2019s opinion about \\(P\\). Absent\nthose first-order reasons, however, Kelly doubts that there is much\nleft to work with the discount the interlocutor, and the drastic\nconciliation that should result without a good reason to discount his\nopinion is implausible.\n\n\nThis motivation for the Total Evidence View has been responded to in\nseveral different ways. One route of response is deny Kelly\u2019s\nassessment of the cases (Matheson 2015a). According to this response,\nthe individuals in Bootstrapping were both presented with powerful,\nthough misleading, higher-order evidence. However, misleading evidence\nis evidence nevertheless. Given this, it can be argued that the\nindividuals still correctly responded to their total body of evidence.\nFor instance, we can imagine a logician working on a new proof. Suppose\nthat it seems to him that he has successfully completed the proof, yet\nhe nevertheless has made a subtle error rendering the whole thing\ninvalid. In such a case, the logician has significantly mis-evaluated\nhis first-order evidence, yet he has strong higher-order evidence that\nhe is good at things like this. Suppose he then shows his work to a\ncapable colleague who also maintains that the proof is successful. In\nthis case, it may seem that it is rational for the logician to believe\nthat the proof is successful, and perhaps be quite confident, even\nthough this conclusion is significantly different from what the\nfirst-order evidence supports. According to this rejoinder, the call to\nsplit the difference is best seen as addressing the Belief\nQuestion.\n\n\nA second route of response is to emphasize the distinction between\nthe Response Question and the Belief Question. According to this\nresponse, while there may be something epistemically defective about\nthe final doxastic states of the individuals in Bootstrapping, they\nnevertheless had the rational response to the higher-order evidence\n(Christensen 2011). The fact that they each misjudged the original\nevidence is an epistemic flaw that carries over to their final doxastic\nattitude, but on this line of thinking the doxastic response that each\nparty made upon comparing notes was nevertheless rational. According to\nthis rejoinder, the call to split the difference is best seen as\naddressing the Response Question.\n",
