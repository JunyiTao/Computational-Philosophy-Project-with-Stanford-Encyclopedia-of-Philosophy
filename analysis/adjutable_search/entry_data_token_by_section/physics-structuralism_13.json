Hence most\nof the structuralistic literature concerns the Sneedean variant.\nPerhaps this is partly also due to the circumstance that only\nSneed\u2019s approach is intended to apply (and has been applied) to\nother sciences and not only physics.\n\nA more comprehensive account of the historical roots of structuralism\nin philosophy of science can be found in Bolinger (2016), although\nthis book is not yet translated into English. The seminal book was\nSneed (1971) which presented a meta-theory of physics in the\nmodel-theoretical tradition connected with P. Suppes, B. C. van\nFraassen, and F. Suppe. This approach was adopted and popularized by\nthe German philosopher W. Stegm\u00fcller (1923\u20131991), see e.g.,\nStegm\u00fcller (1979b) and further developed mainly by his disciples.\nIn its early days the approach was called the \u201cnon-statement\nview\u201d of theories, emphasizing the r\u00f4le of set-theoretical\ntools as opposed to linguistic analyses. Later this aspect was\nconsidered to be more of practical importance than a matter of\nprinciple, see Balzer et al. (1987, 306 ff). Recently, H.\nAndreas (2014) and G. Schurz (2014) have proposed two slightly\ndifferent frameworks that reconcile semantical and syntactical\nformulations of Sneed\u2019s program. Nevertheless, the almost\nexclusive use of set-theoretic tools remains one of the characteristic\nstylistic features of this program and one that distinguishes it\nconspicuously from the other programs.\n5.1.2 Central notions of Sneed\u2019s program\n\nAccording to Moulines, in Balzer and Moulines (1996, 12\u201313), the\nspecific notions of the Sneedean program are the following. We\nillustrate these notions by simplified examples, inspired by Balzer\net al. (1987), which are based on a system of \\(N\\) classical\npoint particles coupled by springs satisfying Hooke\u2019s law. For a\nrecent introduction into the basic concepts see also H. Andreas and F.\nZenker (2014).\n\n\\(M_p\\): A class of potential models (the theory\u2019s\nconceptual framework.\n\n\n[One potential model contains a set of particles, a set of springs\ntogether with their spring constants, the masses of the particles, as\nwell as their positions and mutual forces as functions of time.]\n \n\\(M\\): A class of actual models (the theory\u2019s empirical\nlaws).\n\n\n[\\(M\\) is the subclass of potential models satisfying the\nsystem\u2019s equation of motion. ]\n \n\\(\\langle M_p,M\\rangle\\): A model-element (the absolutely\nnecessary portion of a theory)\n\\(M_{pp}\\): A class of partial potential models (the\ntheory\u2019s relative non-theoretical basis).\n\n\n[One partial potential model contains only the particles\u2019\npositions as functions of time, since the masses and forces are\nconsidered as \\(T\\)-theoretical.]\n \n\\(C\\): A class of constraints (conditions connecting different\nmodels of one and the same theory).\n\n\n[The constraints say that the same particles have the same masses and\nthe same springs have the same spring constants.]\n \n\\(L\\): A class of links (conditions connecting models of different\ntheories).\n\n\n[Among the conceivable links are:\n\n\nLinks to the theory of classical spacetime\nLinks to the theory of weights and balances, where mass ratios can\nbe measured\nLinks to theories of elasticity, where spring constants can be\ncalculated]\n\n \n\\(A\\): A class of admissible blurs (degrees of approximation\nadmitted between different models).\n\n\n[The functions occurring in the potential models are complemented by\nsuitable error bars. These may depend on the intended applications,\nsee below.]\n \n\\(K = \\langle M_p,M,M_{pp}, C,L,A\\rangle\\): A core (the\nformal-theoretical part of a theory)\n\\(I\\): The domain of intended applications (\u201cpieces of the\nworld\u201d to be explained, predicted or technologically\nmanipulated).\n\n\n[This class is open and contains, for example\n\n\nsystems of small rigid bodies, connected by coil springs or rubber\nbands\nany vibrating mechanical system in the case of small amplitudes,\nincluding almost rigid bodies consisting of \\(N\\) molecules]\n\n \n\\(T = \\langle K,I\\rangle\\): A theory-element (the smallest unit to\nbe regarded as a theory).\n\\(\\sigma\\): The specialization relation between theory-elements.\n\n\n[\\(T\\) could be a specialization of similar theory-elements with more\ngeneral force laws, e.g., including friction and/or time-dependent\nexternal forces. One could also imagine more abstract force laws which\nfix only some general properties such as\n\u201caction=reaction\u201d. \\(T\\) in turn could be specialized to\ntheory-elements of systems with equal masses and/or equal spring\nconstants. ]\n \n\\(N\\): A theory-net (a set of theory-elements ordered by\n\\(\\sigma\\) \u2014 the \u201ctypical\u201d notion of a theory).\n\n\n[An obvious theory-net containing our example of a theory-element is\nCPM = \u201cclassical particle mechanics\u201d, conceived as a\nnetwork of theory-elements essentially ordered by the degree of\ngenerality of its force laws.]\n \n\\(E\\): A theory-evolution (a theory-net \u201cmoving\u201d\nthrough historical time).\n\n\n[Special interesting new force laws could be discovered in the course\nof time, e.g., the Toda chain in 1967, as well as new applications of\nknown laws.]\n \n\\(H\\): A theory-holon (a complex of theory-nets tied by\n\u201cessential\u201d links).\n\n\n[It is difficult to think of examples which are smaller than \\(H =\\)\nall physical theory-nets.]\n \n\n",
