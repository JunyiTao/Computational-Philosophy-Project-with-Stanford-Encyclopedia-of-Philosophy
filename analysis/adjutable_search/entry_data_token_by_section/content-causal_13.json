    "main_text": "General Objections to Causal Theories of Mental Content || Causal Theories Conflict with the Theory Mediation of Perception\n4.6 Causal Theories Conflict with the Theory Mediation of Perception\n\nCummins (1997) argues that causal theories of mental content are\nincompatible with the fact that one\u2019s perception of objects in\nthe physical environment is typically mediated by a theory. His\nargument proceeds in two stages. In one stage, he argues that, on a\ncausal theory, for each primitive \u201cX\u201d there must be some\nbit of machinery or mechanism that is responsible for detecting Xs.\nBut, since a finite device, such as the human brain, contains only a\nfinite amount of material, it can only generate a finite number of\nprimitive representations. Next, he observes that thought is\nproductive\u2014that it can, in principle, generate an unbounded\nnumber of semantically distinct representations. This means that to\ngenerate the stock of mental representations corresponding to each of\nthese distinct thoughts, one must have a syntactically and\nsemantically combinatorial system of mental representation of the sort\nfound in a language of thought (LOT). More explicitly, this scheme of\nmental representation must have the following properties:\n\nIt has a finite number of semantically primitive expressions.\nEvery expression is a concatenation of one or more primitive\nexpressions.\nThe content of any complex expression is a function of the\ncontents of the primitives and the way those primitives are\nconcatenated into the whole expression.\n\n\nThe conclusion of this first stage is, therefore, that a causal theory\nof mental representation requires a LOT. In the other stage of his\nargument, Cummins observes that, for a wide range of objects, their\nperception is mediated by a body of theory. Thus, to perceive\ndogs\u2014for dogs to cause \u201cdogs\u201d\u2014one has to know\nthings such as that dogs have tails, dogs have fur, and dogs four\nlegs. But, to know that dogs have tails, fur, and four legs, one needs\na set of mental representations, such as \u201ctail\u201d,\n\u201cfur\u201d, \u201cfour\u201d, and \u201clegs\u201d. Now the\nproblem fully emerges. According to causal theories, having an\n\u201cX\u201d representation requires the ability to detect dogs.\nBut, the ability to detect dogs requires a theory of dogs. But, having\na theory of dogs requires already having a LOT\u2014a system of\nmental representation. One cannot generate mental representations\nwithout already having\n them.[12]\n",
