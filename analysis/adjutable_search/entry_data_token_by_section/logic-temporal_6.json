The operators \\(P\\) and \\(F\\) are often referred to as the\n\u2018weak\u2019 temporal operators, while \\(H\\) and \\(G\\) are known\nas the \u2018strong\u2019 ones. The respective past and future\noperators are duals of each other, i.e., they are interdefinable by\nmeans of the following equivalences: \n\n\\[\nP\\varphi \\equiv \\neg H\\neg \\varphi, H\\varphi \\equiv \\neg P\\neg\n\\varphi \\text{ and } F\\varphi \\equiv \\neg G\\neg \\varphi, G\\varphi \\equiv \\neg\nF\\neg \\varphi.\n\\]\n\n\nIn light of these equivalences, the set of formulae of TL can be\nrecursively defined as follows, over a given set of atomic\npropositions \\(PROP\\): \n\n\\[\n\\varphi := p \\in {PROP} \\mid \\bot \\mid \\lnot \\varphi \\mid (\\varphi \\land \\varphi) \\mid\nP\\varphi \\mid F\\varphi.\n\\] \n\n The truth-functional connectives\n\\(\\vee,\\to,\\) and \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) are definable in terms of\n\\(\\lnot\\) and \\(\\land\\) as usual. Besides, we can define \\(A\\varphi\n=H\\varphi \\wedge \\varphi \\wedge G\\varphi\\) and, dually, \\(E\\varphi\n=P\\varphi \\vee \\varphi \\vee F\\varphi,\\) which on linear flows of time\nmean \u201calways\u201d and \u201csometime\u201d,\nrespectively.\n\nAs said, Prior\u2019s introduction of the temporal operators was\ninitially motivated by the use of tense in natural language, and\nvarious tenses in natural language can, at least approximately, be\ncaptured in TL. For example:\n\n\\(P\\varphi\\) \ncorresponds to \u201c\\(\\varphi\\) was the case\u201d or\n\u201c\\(\\varphi\\) has been the case\u201d.\n\\(F\\varphi\\) \ncorresponds to \u201c\\(\\varphi\\) will be the\ncase\u201d.\n\\(PP\\varphi\\) corresponds\nto \u201c\\(\\varphi\\) had been the\ncase\u201d.\n\\(FP\\varphi\\) corresponds\nto \u201c\\(\\varphi\\) will have been\nthe case\u201d.\n\\(PF\\varphi\\) corresponds\nto \u201c\\(\\varphi\\) would be the\ncase\u201d or \u201c\\(\\varphi\\) was going to be the\ncase\u201d.\n\n\nHamblin and Prior showed that, in models of linear time, any sequence\nof temporal operators reduces to a sequence of at most two operators.\nIn total, they identified 15 different such combinations \u2014 or\ntenses, as they call them \u2014 that can be expressed in TL\nover linear flows of time (see Prior 1967, Chapter III.5). Even though\nthese combinations seem to surpass the number of verbal tenses in e.g.\nEnglish, there are also temporal properties of natural language that\ncannot be captured in TL: Prior\u2019s temporal operators are, for\ninstance, not very well suited to model distinctions of aspect (e.g.\nthe distinction between \u201cI wrote a letter\u201d and \u201cI\nwas writing a letter\u201d), which are arguably more adequately dealt\nwith in an interval-based framework. For details, see Kuhn and Portner\n(2006) and the entry on\n tense and aspect.\n",
