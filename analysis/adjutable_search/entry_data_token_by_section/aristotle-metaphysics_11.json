Actuality and Potentiality\n\nIn Metaphysics \u0396, Aristotle introduces the distinction\nbetween matter and form synchronically, applying it to an individual\nsubstance at a particular time. The matter of a substance is the stuff\nit is composed of; the form is the way that stuff is put together so\nthat the whole it constitutes can perform its characteristic\nfunctions. But soon he begins to apply the distinction diachronically,\nacross time. This connects the matter/form distinction to another key\nAristotelian distinction, that between potentiality (dunamis)\nand actuality (entelecheia) or activity (energeia).\nThis distinction is the main topic of Book \u0398.\n\nAristotle distinguishes between two different senses of the term\ndunamis. In the strictest sense, a dunamis is the\npower that a thing has to produce a change. A thing has a\ndunamis in this sense when it has within it \u201ca\nstarting-point of change in another thing or in itself insofar as it\nis other\u201d (\u0398.1, 1046a12; cf. \u0394.12). The\nexercise of such a power is a kin\u00easis\u2014a movement\nor process. So, for example, the housebuilder\u2019s craft is a power\nwhose exercise is the process of housebuilding. But there is a second\nsense of dunamis\u2014and it is the one in which Aristotle\nis mainly interested\u2014that might be better translated as\n\u2018potentiality\u2019. For, as Aristotle tells us, in this sense\ndunamis is related not to movement (kin\u00easis)\nbut to activity (energeia)(\u0398.6, 1048a25). A\ndunamis in this sense is not a thing\u2019s power to produce\na change but rather its capacity to be in a different and more\ncompleted state. Aristotle thinks that potentiality so understood is\nindefinable (1048a37), claiming that the general idea can\nbe grasped from a consideration of cases. Activity is to potentiality,\nAristotle tells us, as \u201cwhat is awake is in relation to what is\nasleep, and what is seeing is in relation to what has its eyes closed\nbut has sight, and what has been shaped out of the matter is in\nrelation to the matter\u201d (1048b1\u20133).\n\nThis last illustration is particularly illuminating. Consider, for\nexample, a piece of wood, which can be carved or shaped into a table\nor into a bowl. In Aristotle\u2019s terminology, the wood has (at\nleast) two different potentialities, since it is potentially a table\nand also potentially a bowl. The matter (in this case, wood) is linked\nwith potentialty; the substance (in this case, the table or the bowl)\nis linked with actuality. The as yet uncarved wood is only potentially\na table, and so it might seem that once it is carved the wood is\nactually a table. Perhaps this is what Aristotle means, but it is\npossible that he does not wish to consider the wood to be a table. His\nidea might be that not only can a piece of raw wood in the\ncarpenter\u2019s workshop be considered a potential table (since it\ncan be transformed into one), but the wood composing the completed\ntable is also, in a sense, a potential table. The idea here is that it\nis not the wood qua wood that is actually a table, but the wood qua\ntable. Considered as matter, it remains only potentially the thing\nthat it is the matter of. (A contemporary philosopher might make this\npoint by refusing to identify the wood with the table, saying instead\nthat the wood only constitutes the table and is not identical to the\ntable it constitutes.)\n\nSince Aristotle gives form priority over matter, we would expect him\nsimilarly to give actuality priority over potentiality. And that is\nexactly what we find (\u0398.8, 1049b4\u20135). Aristotle\ndistinguishes between priority in logos (account or\ndefinition), in time, and in substance. (1) Actuality is prior in\nlogos since we must cite the actuality when we give an\naccount of its corresponding potentiality. Thus, \u2018visible\u2019\nmeans \u2018capable of being seen\u2019;\n\u2018buildable\u2019 means \u2018capable of being\nbuilt\u2019(1049b14\u201316). (2) As regards\ntemporal priority, by contrast, potentiality may well seem to be prior\nto actuality, since the wood precedes the table that is built from it,\nand the acorn precedes the oak that it grows into. Nevertheless,\nAristotle finds that even temporally there is a sense in which\nactuality is prior to potentiality: \u201cthe active that is the same\nin form, though not in number [with a potentially existing thing], is\nprior [to it]\u201d (1049b18\u201319). A particular acorn\nis, of course, temporally prior to the particular oak tree that it\ngrows into, but it is preceded in time by the actual oak tree that\nproduced it, with which it is identical in species. The seed\n(potential substance) must have been preceded by an adult (actual\nsubstance). So in this sense actuality is prior even in time.\n\n(3) Aristotle argues for the priority in substance of actuality over\npotentiality in two ways. (a) The first argument makes use of his\nnotion of final causality. Things that come to be move toward an end\n(telos)\u2014the boy becomes a man, the acorn becomes an\noak\u2014and \u201cthe activity is the end, and it is for the sake\nof this that the capacity [or potentiality] is acquired. For animals\ndo not see in order that they may have sight, rather they have sight\nin order that they may see \u2026 matter is potentially something\nbecause it may come in the form of it\u2014at any rate, when it is\nactively something, then it is in the form of it\u201d\n(1050a9\u201317). Form or actuality is the end toward\nwhich natural processes are directed. Actuality is therefore a cause\nin more than one sense of a thing\u2019s realizing its potential. As\nwe noted in Section 11, one and the same thing may be the final,\nformal, and efficient cause of another. Suppose an acorn realizes its\npotential to become an oak tree. The efficient cause here is the\nactual oak tree that produced the acorn; the formal cause is the\nlogos defining that actuality; the final cause is the\ntelos toward which the acorn develops\u2014an actual\n(mature) oak tree.\n\n(b) Aristotle also offers (1050b6\u20131051a2)\nan \u201ceven stricter\u201d argument for his claim that actuality\nis prior in substance to potentiality. A potentiality is for either of\na pair of opposites; so anything that is capable of being is also\ncapable of not being. What is capable of not being might possibly not\nbe, and what might possibly not be is perishable. Hence anything with\nthe mere potentiality to be is perishable. What is eternal is\nimperishable, and so nothing that is eternal can exist only\npotentially\u2014what is eternal must be fully actual. But the\neternal is prior in substance to the perishable. For the eternal can\nexist without the perishable, but not conversely, and that is what\npriority in substance amounts to (cf. \u0394.11, 1019a2).\nSo what is actual is prior in substance to what is potential.\n",
