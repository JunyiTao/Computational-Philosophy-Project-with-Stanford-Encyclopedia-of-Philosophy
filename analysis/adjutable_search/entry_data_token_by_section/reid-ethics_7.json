    "main_text": "The Moral Sense\n4. The Moral Sense\n\nWe noted earlier that contemporary philosophers tend to think of\nmodern philosophers as being either rationalists or sentimentalists\nabout morality. We also noted that Reid does not fit comfortably in\neither category, as his views tend to blend together both rationalist\nand sentimentalist commitments. This becomes especially evident in\nReid\u2019s discussion of the moral sense. (See Davis 2006 for a\ndiscussion of how Reid\u2019s account of the moral sense is\ninfluenced by the legal practices of his day.)\n\nIt was Francis Hutcheson who first developed the claim that we are\nendowed with a moral sense. While Hutcheson\u2019s position has been\nvariously interpreted, his considered position appears to run as\nfollows. Rationalists tell us that our moral judgments are the output\nof reason. But many of our ordinary, nonmoral judgments are not the\noutput of reason. Our perceptual judgments concerning the external\nworld, our judgments about our own pain and pleasure, and our\naesthetic judgments, for example, are not the products of reason.\nRather, they are the products of various \u201csenses\u201d or\n\u201cdeterminations of our minds to receive Ideas independently of\nour Will\u201d (ONC, 17). Moral judgments, Hutcheson claims, are no\ndifferent in this respect. They are also the product not of reason but\nof a sense, in this case, the moral sense. Although Hutcheson\nhimself describes this sense in different ways, it is probably best to\nthink of it as a faculty that has two basic functions.\n\nIn the first place, it is that faculty by which we form moral ideas or\nconcepts and in such a way that does not involve any sort of reasoning\nor calculation. Rather, the \u201cauthor of Nature\u201d has\ndesigned us in such a way that, in a certain range of circumstances,\nwhen an agent is aware of the behavior of himself or others, this\nawareness evokes in him states of approbation. These states of\napprobation, in turn, elicit states of love and esteem for the person\nwhose behavior of which he\u2019s aware. States of approbation,\nHutcheson indicates, thus function as signs of an\nagent\u2019s benevolence, indicating its presence. Love and esteem,\nby contrast, do not indicate benevolence but are rather appropriate\naffective responses to it. Second, these affective states move us to\nbenevolent action. The moral sense at once puts us in contact with\nmoral reality and motivates us to act (see Cuneo 2013; Kail 2007).\n",
