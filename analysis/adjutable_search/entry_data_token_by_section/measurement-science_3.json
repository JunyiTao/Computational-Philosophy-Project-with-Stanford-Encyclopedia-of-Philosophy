Bertrand Russell similarly stated that measurement is \n\n\nany method by which a unique and reciprocal correspondence is\nestablished between all or some of the magnitudes of a kind and all or\nsome of the numbers, integral, rational or real. (1903: 176) \n\n\nNorman Campbell defined measurement simply as \u201cthe process of\nassigning numbers to represent qualities\u201d, where a quality is a\nproperty that admits of non-arbitrary ordering (1920: 267).\n\nDefining measurement as numerical assignment raises the question:\nwhich assignments are adequate, and under what conditions? Early\nmeasurement theorists like Helmholtz (1887), H\u00f6lder (1901) and\nCampbell (1920) argued that numbers are adequate for expressing\nmagnitudes insofar as algebraic operations among numbers mirror\nempirical relations among magnitudes. For example, the qualitative\nrelation \u201clonger than\u201d among rigid rods is (roughly)\ntransitive and asymmetrical, and in this regard shares structural\nfeatures with the relation \u201clarger than\u201d among numbers.\nMoreover, the end-to-end concatenation of rigid rods shares structural\nfeatures\u2014such as associativity and commutativity\u2014with the\nmathematical operation of addition. A similar situation holds for the\nmeasurement of weight with an equal-arms balance. Here deflection of\nthe arms provides ordering among weights and the heaping of weights on\none pan constitutes concatenation.\n\nEarly measurement theorists formulated axioms that describe these\nqualitative empirical structures, and used these axioms to prove\ntheorems about the adequacy of assigning numbers to magnitudes that\nexhibit such structures. Specifically, they proved that ordering and\nconcatenation are together sufficient for the construction of an\nadditive numerical representation of the relevant magnitudes.\nAn additive representation is one in which addition is empirically\nmeaningful, and hence also multiplication, division etc. Campbell\ncalled measurement procedures that satisfy the conditions of\nadditivity \u201cfundamental\u201d because they do not involve the\nmeasurement of any other magnitude (1920: 277). Kinds of magnitudes\nfor which a fundamental measurement procedure has been\nfound\u2014such as length, area, volume, duration, weight and\nelectrical resistance\u2014Campbell called \u201cfundamental\nmagnitudes\u201d. A hallmark of such magnitudes is that it is\npossible to generate them by concatenating a standard sequence of\nequal units, as in the example of a series of equally spaced marks on\na ruler.\n\nAlthough they viewed additivity as the hallmark of measurement, most\nearly measurement theorists acknowledged that additivity is not\nnecessary for measuring. Other magnitudes exist that admit of ordering\nfrom smaller to greater, but whose ratios and/or differences cannot\ncurrently be determined except through their relations to other,\nfundamentally measurable magnitudes. Examples are temperature, which\nmay be measured by determining the volume of a mercury column, and\ndensity, which may be measured as the ratio of mass and volume. Such\nindirect determination came to be called \u201cderived\u201d\nmeasurement and the relevant magnitudes \u201cderived\nmagnitudes\u201d (Campbell 1920: 275\u20137).\n\nAt first glance, the distinction between fundamental and derived\nmeasurement may seem reminiscent of the distinction between extensive\nand intensive magnitudes, and indeed fundamental measurement is\nsometimes called \u201cextensive\u201d. Nonetheless, it is important\nto note that the two distinctions are based on significantly different\ncriteria of measurability. As discussed in\n Section 2,\n the extensive-intensive distinction focused on the intrinsic\nstructure of the quantity in question, i.e., whether or not it is\ncomposed of spatio-temporal parts. The fundamental-derived\ndistinction, by contrast, focuses on the properties of measurement\noperations. A fundamentally measurable magnitude is one for\nwhich a fundamental measurement operation has been found.\nConsequently, fundamentality is not an intrinsic property of a\nmagnitude: a derived magnitude can become fundamental with the\ndiscovery of new operations for its measurement. Moreover, in\nfundamental measurement the numerical assignment need not mirror the\nstructure of spatio-temporal parts. Electrical resistance, for\nexample, can be fundamentally measured by connecting resistors in a\nseries (Campbell 1920: 293). This is considered a fundamental\nmeasurement operation because it has a shared structure with numerical\naddition, even though objects with equal resistance are not generally\nequal in size.\n\nThe distinction between fundamental and derived measurement was\nrevised by subsequent authors. Brian Ellis (1966: Ch. 5\u20138)\ndistinguished among three types of measurement: fundamental,\nassociative and derived. Fundamental measurement requires ordering and\nconcatenation operations satisfying the same conditions specified by\nCampbell. Associative measurement procedures are based on a\ncorrelation of two ordering relationships, e.g., the correlation\nbetween the volume of a mercury column and its temperature. Derived\nmeasurement procedures consist in the determination of the value of a\nconstant in a physical law. The constant may be local, as in the\ndetermination of the specific density of water from mass and volume,\nor universal, as in the determination of the Newtonian gravitational\nconstant from force, mass and distance. Henry Kyburg (1984: Ch.\n5\u20137) proposed a somewhat different threefold distinction among\ndirect, indirect and systematic measurement, which does not completely\noverlap with that of\n Ellis.[4]\n A more radical revision of the distinction between fundamental and\nderived measurement was offered by R. Duncan Luce and John Tukey\n(1964) in their work on conjoint measurement, which will be discussed\nin\n Section 3.4.\n",
