    "main_text": "\n\nIs there a moral difference between doing harm and\n merely[1]\n allowing harm? If not, there should be no moral objection to active\neuthanasia in circumstances where passive euthanasia is permissible;\nand there should be no objection to bombing innocent civilians where\ndoing so will minimize the overall number of deaths in war. There\nshould, however, be an objection\u2014indeed, an outcry\u2014at our\nfailure to prevent the deaths of millions of children in the third\nworld from malnutrition, dehydration, and\n measles.[2]\n Moreover, it seems that the question is pertinent to whether\nconsequentialism is true, as consequentialists believe that doing harm\nis no worse than merely allowing harm while anti-consequentialists,\nalmost universally, disagree. But is there a moral difference between\ndoing harm and merely allowing harm? We might divide approaches to\nthis question into two broad kinds. First, those that attempt to\nanswer it without saying anything about the nature of the distinction\neither by use of examples (\u2018the contrast strategy\u2019) or by\nappealing to considerations that are purportedly independent of the\nprecise nature of distinction. And, second, those that analyze the\ndistinction in depth and try to show that its underlying nature\ndictates an answer to the moral question.\n",
