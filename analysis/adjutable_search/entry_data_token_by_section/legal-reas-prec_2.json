    "main_text": "Precedent || Precedents as laying down rules\n2.1 Precedents as laying down rules\n\n\nOn the first approach precedents operate by laying down rules which\nlater courts are then bound to apply to the facts before them. \n(For versions of this view, see Raz 1979; MacCormick 1978 (especially\n82\u20136, 213\u201328) and 1987; Alexander 1989; and Schauer 1989,\n469\u201371 and 1991,\n 174\u201387.[7])\n In holding that (i)\u2013(iii) were the crucial facts for the\nresolution of the case, the court is creating a rule that whenever\ntrust property is transferred in breach of trust to a volunteer (i.e.,\none who does not pay for the property), the volunteer must restore the\nproperty to the beneficiary. The case decides a particular dispute,\nbut the court creates a rule to deal with that type of dispute and\napplies it to the case at hand. On this view, then, precedents are\nakin to statutes in that they lay down rules which apply to later\ncases whose facts satisfy the conditions for application.\n\n\nIn favour of this interpretation of precedent is the distinction drawn\nin legal practice between what is known as the \u2018ratio\ndecidendi\u2019 of a case and \u2018obiter\ndicta\u2019. The ratio of a case represents the\n\u2018holding\u2019 or \u2018ruling\u2019, i.e., the proposition\nof law for which the case is authority\u2014it is the aspect of the\ncase which is binding on later courts. Obiter dicta, by\ncontrast, represent other statements and views expressed in the\njudgment which are not binding on later courts. On this view of\nprecedent, the rule laid down in the earlier case is represented by\nthe ratio. \n\n\nThere are a range of criticisms of the rule-making account of\nprecedent which argue that it does not fit legal practice very well\n(see e.g. Moore 1987, 185\u20137). Two issues stand out: (i) the form\nin which judgments are presented, and (ii) the practice of\ndistinguishing.\n2.1.1 The form of judgments\n\n\nAlthough the idea of the ratio decidendi is a staple\nof legal practice, it is notable that it is a construct from\na precedent rather than an explicit feature of most legal\njudgments. Judgments are highly discursive texts and very rarely\nidentify their own rationes. What is more, even if a court\nchooses to explicitly formulate the ratio of its decision,\nthis precise formulation is not itself regarded as binding on\nlater courts. (See Perry 1987, 235\u20137; Schauer 1989, 455; Simpson\n1973, 372; Moore 1987, 185\u20136; Stone 1985, 123\u20139.)\n\n\nIt is often said that this creates a marked contrast with statutes,\nwhere a canonical formulation of the legal rule being laid down\nis provided. Given the flexibility open to later courts\nto determine the ratio of the earlier decision, it is\nmisleading to think that decisions lay down binding rules for later\ncourts. However, although there is a contrast with legislation\nhere, it can be exaggerated. In both situations the propositions\nof law for which a case or statutory provision is authority must be\nderived from the case or statute and is not identical with the\ntext of either. The real difference between precedent and statute\nlies in the fact that in the case of statutes legal systems have\nelaborate conventions of interpretation to assist in the process of\nderiving the law from a legislative text, whereas in the case of\nprecedents they do not. But this simply shows that the law\nderived from precedents may be vaguer and more indeterminate than that\nderived from (many) statutes; it does not establish that precedents do\nnot create legal rules.\n2.1.2 The practice of distinguishing\n\n\nAn integral part of legal reasoning using precedents is the practice\nof distinguishing. Distinguishing involves a precedent not\nbeing followed even though the facts of the later case fall within the\nscope of the ratio of the earlier case. As the later case\nfalls within the scope of the earlier ratio (i.e., within the\nscope of the rule), one might expect that the decision in the later\ncase must be the same (unless the court has the power to overrule the\nearlier case and decides to do so). In legal reasoning using\nprecedents, however, the later court is free not to follow the earlier\ncase by pointing to some difference in the facts between the two\ncases, even though those facts do not feature in the\nratio of the earlier case.\n\n\nTake the trust example: in a later case the recipient of trust\nproperty may not have paid for the property, but may have relied on\nthe receipt in entering into another arrangement (e.g. in using the\nproperty as security for a loan). The later court may hold that the\nrecipient is entitled to retain the property and justify its decision\nby ruling that where (i) the defendant has received trust property\n(ii) in breach of trust and (iii) has not paid for the property, but\nhas (vii) relied upon the receipt to disadvantageously alter her\nposition, then the defendant is entitled to retain the property.\n(This result would still leave the beneficiary with a claim against\nthe trustee for the value of the property.)\n\n\nThe effect of distinguishing, then, is that the later court is free\nnot to follow a precedent that, prima facie, applies to it,\nby making a ruling which is narrower than that made in the precedent\ncase. The only formal constraints on the later court are that: (1) in\nformulating the ratio of the later case, the factors in the\nratio of the earlier case (i.e., (i)\u2013(iii)) must be\nretained, and (2) the ruling in the later case must be such that it\nwould still support the result reached in the precedent\ncase. In short, the ruling in the second case must not be inconsistent\nwith the result in the precedent case, but the court is otherwise free\nto make a ruling narrower than that in the precedent. Hence the more\naccurate statements of the doctrine of precedent are to the effect\nthat a later court must either follow or distinguish\na binding precedent\u2014a disjunctive obligation.\n\n\nAt a formal level the practice of distinguishing can be reconciled\nwith the view that rationes are rules by arguing that later\ncourts have the power to modify the rule in the earlier\ncase. An analogy can be drawn to the power to overrule earlier\ndecisions: just as judges can overrule earlier cases, they\ncan also modify earlier law, thereby paralleling the power of\nlegislators to either repeal or amend the law. The analogy, however,\nis very imperfect. There are two difficulties: (a) Common Lawyers do\nnot conceptualise overruling and distinguishing in this parallel way,\nand (b) the rationale for a power with this particular scope is\nunclear.\n\n\nOn the first point, Common Lawyers ordinarily think of precedents as\nconstituting the law up and until they are overruled. Once overruled\nthe later decision is (normally) given retroactive effect, so the law\nis changed for the past as well as the future. But when a case is\ndistinguished it is not often thought that the law was one thing until\nthe later decision of a court, and now another thing.  The law will be\nregarded prior to the later decision as already subject to various\ndistinctions not mentioned by the earlier court.  Indeed part of the\nskill of a good common lawyer is grasping the law as not\nstated by the earlier court: learning that cases are\n\u2018distinguishable\u2019 is a staple part of common law\neducation, and no common lawyer would be competent who did not\nappreciate that the law was not to be identified simply with the\nratio of an earlier decision. Common lawyers do not, then,\nconceptualise distinguishing along lines analogous to overruling.\n\n\nOn the second point, one of the peculiarities of distinguishing is\nthat it cuts across the normal justifications for having rules, namely\nto have a class of cases treated in a certain way despite individual\nvariation between them, with attendant gains in predictability and\ntransparency in the decision-making process. Instead, the later court\nis free to avoid the result indicated by the earlier ratio so\nlong as it can find some difference in facts between the two cases\nthat narrows the earlier ratio while still supporting the\nresult in the earlier case. What is more, this power is not merely\ngiven to courts of the same level of authority as the one laying down\nthe precedent (as is the case with overruling), but is given to every\ncourt lower in the judicial hierarchy.  So the Court of\nAppeal in England cannot overrule a decision of the House of Lords\n(nor even its own decisions ordinarily), but it is free to distinguish\na decision of the House of Lords even when the case before it falls\nwithin the ratio of the House of Lords decision. So on the\nrule-making view of precedent lower courts have the power to narrow\nthe rules laid down by higher courts, just so long as the narrower\nrule would still support the result reached in the earlier case. It is\nunclear why lower courts should be given a power to narrow rulings of\nhigher courts in this particularly circumscribed manner.\n\n\nTwo ways in which distinguishing can be made less idiosyncratic are\nthese: (a) to argue that the later court is restricted to making a\nmodification which the earlier court would have made if confronted\nwith the current facts (cf. Raz 1979, 187\u20138), i.e., that\ndistinguishing is a form of reinterpretation of the original\nratio; or (b) to argue that there is a presumption\nagainst distinguishing (Schauer 1989, 469\u201371; 1991,\n174\u201387).  Each of these approaches echo forms of legal reasoning\nfound in statutory construction. The first, in asking what the earlier\ncourt would have done, assimilates the task of distinguishing to that\nof determining the law-maker's intent behind their ruling.  This\nis parallel to the practice of interpreting statutes in terms of\nlegislative intent. The alternative approach of there being a\npresumption against distinguishing parallels the creation of\nexceptions to statutory\n rules.[8]\n\n\nThe problem with these two suggestions is that the practice of\ndistinguishing does not conform to either of these constraints: while\ncourts do consider the earlier decision in order to see if\nthe ratio can be reinterpreted, they also introduce\ndistinctions without recourse to the earlier court's views; and\nthey do not typically approach the task of distinguishing as if there\nis a presumption against it. As a matter of legal practice, then,\nthere are no legal restrictions of this kind on the later court.\nDistinguishing, then, does not seem to fit easily with the\nunderstanding of rationes as creating binding legal\nrules. (See also Perry 1987, 237\u20139 on\ndistinguishing.)\n\n\nA third way which purports to deal with the problem of\ndistinguishing on the rule model is to argue that the\n\u2018rule\u2019 for which the decision is binding is not the\nprecedent court's ruling, but something narrower\u2014the\n\u2018material facts\u2019 that were \u2018necessary\u2019 for the\nresult of the case. (See Goodhart 1930, 1959; and see also Burton\n1995, 25\u201358, 60\u20135 on \u2018case-specific facts\u2019 and\nEisenberg 1988, 51\u20134 on \u2018minimalist\u2019 and\n\u2018result-centred\u2019 techniques.)  This approach makes use of\nthe fact that decisions do not provide canonical formulations of the\nratio to argue that the ratio is not to be\nidentified with the court's stated ruling on the\nissue. The effect of such an approach is to narrow what is regarded as\nbinding in the case to those facts which were crucial to the actual\noutcome, rather than the stated ruling applied to those facts. The\ndifficulties with this approach are three-fold:\n\n\n (1) it goes against general legal practice, which usually does\nidentify the ratio with the ruling made by the precedent\ncourt (see Simpson 1961, 168\u20139; MacCormick 1978, 82\u20133,\n1987, 157\u20138; Raz 1979, 184; Eisenberg 1988,\n 51\u201361)[9];\n\n\n(2) if the precedent court's own characterisation of its ruling\nis abandoned, there is no coherent way to settle on the\n\u2018material facts\u2019 (Stone 1964, 267\u201380, 1985,\n123\u20139). Take the case of the recipient of trust property\ntransferred in breach of trust. A key aspect of the facts is that the\nrecipient did not pay for the property. But why is this\n\u2018material\u2019?  If the court's own reasoning is put to\none side, is it because no consideration was given (so had a\ntoken been provided that would have been sufficient); or that\ninadequate consideration was provided (so more than a token\nwould be necessary); or that a reasonable price was not paid;\nor that the price was not what the beneficiary would have been willing\nto accept for the transfer; or that the price is not the best which\nthe trustee could have obtained on the open market?  All of the\npreceding descriptions of the facts are true, but which is\n\u2018material\u2019?  The requirement for any of them would\ninvalidate the transfer. \n\n\n(3) Even if there is some way to characterise the\n\u2018material\u2019 facts, it does not eliminate\ndistinguishing. Take later trust case, for example, in which the\nrecipient has paid nothing for the trust property but has\nacted detrimentally in reliance on the receipt. The recipient is still\na \u2018volunteer\u2019 who has not transferred anything to the\ntrustee for the property, but there has been reliance upon\nthe receipt. This may well lead a later court to distinguish the\nearlier case, although the facts are otherwise identical to those in\nthe original case. On the other hand, if the claim is that the\nprecedent case is only binding when both (a) the\n\u2018material facts\u2019 are present, and (b) no other\nrelevant facts are present, then it is no longer a\n\u2018rule-based\u2019 account of precedent\u2014it is simply\nreasserting the minimal requirement that the decision in the later\ncase must not be inconsistent with the result reached in the precedent\ncase.\n\n",
