    "main_text": "Political Obligation in Historical Perspective\n1. Political Obligation in Historical Perspective\n\nThe phrase \u201cpolitical obligation\u201d is apparently no older\nthan T. H. Green\u2019s Lectures on the Principles of Political\nObligation, delivered at Oxford University in 1879\u201380\n(D\u2019Entr\u00e8ves, p. 3). The two words from which Green formed the\nphrase are much older, of course, and he apparently thought that\ncombining them required no elaborate explanation or defense. In any\ncase, there was nothing novel about the problem Green addressed in his\nlectures: \u201cto discover the true ground or justification for\nobedience to law\u201d (Green 1986, p. 13). Sophocles raised this\nproblem in his play Antigone, first performed around 440 BCE,\nand Plato\u2019s Crito recounts Socrates\u2019 philosophical response\nto the problem, in the face of his own death, some forty years\nlater.\n",
