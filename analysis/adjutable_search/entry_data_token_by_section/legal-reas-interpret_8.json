    "main_text": "The Role of Coherence in Legal Reasoning: || Coherence of What?\n3.2 Coherence of What?\n\n\nThe next issues to consider are (1) what is to be made coherent in\ncoherence accounts of legal reasoning, and (2) what role coherence\nplays in explaining or justifying judicial decisions on such accounts.\nRegarding the question of what is to be made coherent in coherence\naccounts of legal reasoning, Raz 1994a contends that coherence\naccounts, when applied to law, require a \u2018base\u2019 or\nsomething which is to be made coherent, which differs in character in\nsome crucial respects from the sort of base which features in coherence\naccounts in other areas of philosophy. Raz points out that while\ncoherence accounts of justified belief take each person's belief set as\ntheir \u2018base\u2019 or as that which is to be made coherent,\ncoherence accounts of law cannot be person-relative in this way, on\npain of failing to offer an account which is in touch with the concrete\nreality of law in the jurisdiction under consideration. Raz's\ncontention is that the law of a given jurisdiction does not vary with\nthe beliefs of those subject to it, and in his view, that law is\nobjective in this way means that there must be a common base to which\ncoherence accounts in law are addressed. His suggestion in this regard\nis that coherence accounts in law take court decisions and legislative\nand regulatory acts as their base, and hold law to be the set of\nprinciples that makes the most coherent sense of that base. Raz further\ndistinguishes between coherence accounts of law and coherence accounts\nof adjudication. The essential difference between them is the stage at\nwhich considerations of coherence come into play. In the case of a\ncoherence account of law, the whole of what the law is is\ndetermined by applying a coherence test to those court decisions and\nlegislative and regulatory acts of a given jurisdiction. A coherence\naccount of adjudication, however, accepts that the vagaries of politics\nand the influence of political considerations on legislative and\njudicial decisions make it unlikely that the settled law of a\njurisdiction will exhibit coherence to any great extent. This being so,\nif we are to apply a coherence account in order to determine how judges\nought to decide cases according to law (legal reasoning in sense (b)),\nthen we should assume a coherence-independent test to identify the\nsettled law of a jurisdiction first, and then bring in considerations\nof coherence at a later stage, and hold that courts ought to adopt that\noutcome to a case which is favoured by the most coherent set of\npropositions which, were the settled rules of the system justified,\nwould justify them. \n\n\nMacCormick 1984 espouses a similar view of the role which coherence\ncan play in adjudication and gives an indication of how we might think\nof the links between interpretation and coherence in legal reasoning.\nAccording to MacCormick, in deciding a case according to law, courts\nshould first of all interpret the existing law in order to establish a\ncoherent view of some branch of the law, and they should do this by\nshowing how that branch of law is justified according to some coherent\nset of principles or values which underlie it. The court should then\nuse this view of the law in order to justify its decision in a new case\nwhich comes before it. On such an approach, then, once courts establish\nwhat the settled law is, they should then interpret law in applying it\nto a new case such that their decision is in accord with the most\ncoherent account which justifies that settled law.\n",
