    "main_text": "Pragmatism\u2019s Contribution in Other Areas of Philosophy || Aesthetics\n6.4 Philosophy of Education\n\nPeirce had some insightful things to say about pedagogy which\nanticipate today\u2019s \u2018inquiry-based learning\u2019 and\n\u2018research-led teaching\u2019, but they are scattered across his\nwritings (Strand 2005). The giant figure in philosophy of education is\nof course Dewey, who pioneered and established it as a separate sphere\nof study when he first assumed the chair in Philosophy at University\nof Chicago in 1894. Dewey\u2019s career coincided with a period in\nwhich North America\u2019s population was rapidly growing,\nindustrializing and urbanizing, shifting education delivery out of the\nhome into public institutions, and his ideas had enormous impact. Many\nof his suggestions derive from his vision of democracy as not merely a\nsystem of voting but the idea that every societal institution might be\ndesigned to foster maximum flourishing in every citizen. Viewed from\nthis angle, traditional modes of schooling whereby teachers deliver an\napproved (often employer-sanctioned) set of facts for children to\nmemorise count as despotic. Instead the emphasis should be on enabling\nchildren to grow from within, according to their present interests and\ncapabilities, and become lifelong learners, although Dewey equally\ncriticises certain romantic, \u2018child-centred\u2019 educational\ntheorists of his day for neglecting to direct or guide the\nchild\u2019s interests in any particular direction (Hildebrand 2008:\n127). It\u2019s also worth noting that Dewey sees education as\nprimarily a social not an individual process since, as noted above, he\nviews human identity formation as irremediably social. \n\nThe result is a \u2018problem-centred pedagogy\u2019 which looks to\npragmatist epistemology understood as the theory of inquiry for its\nstructure. The teacher begins by facilitating contact with some\nphenomenon which proves genuinely puzzling to the students, then\nguides them through a cycle of inquiry which (if all goes well)\nresolves the problematic situation to the satisfaction of all present.\nThis cycle of inquiry includes as stages: articulating the problem and\nquestions which might need to be answered in its resolution, gathering\ndata, suggesting hypotheses which might potentially resolve the\nproblem, and testing or otherwise evaluating those hypotheses. Opening\nup the classroom to such \u2018live\u2019 thinking generates\nunpredictability which can be challenging for the teacher to manage,\nbut if the genuine indeterminacy of the problematic situation can be\nsuccessfully navigated, the reward will be students who have learned\nnot just how to know, but how to think. In that regard,\nDewey claimed that his writings on education summed up his entire\nphilosophical position (Hildebrand 2008: 124). For Dewey, all\nphilosophy was philosophy of education.\n",
