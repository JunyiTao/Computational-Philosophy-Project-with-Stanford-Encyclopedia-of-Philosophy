    "main_text": "Why care about others? || Impartial Reason\n4.2 Impartial Reason\n\nWe turn now to the idea, central to one modern approach to ethics,\nthat when we think morally, we reason from an impartial or impersonal\nperspective. Moral thinking is not self-centered. Of course we all\nhave an emotional bias that attaches special weight to self-interest,\nand we are often partial to our particular circle of friends or our\ncommunity. But when we look at the world from a moral point of view,\nwe try to set aside this self-centered framework. Taking a god\u2019s\neye perspective on things, we ask ourselves what one ought to\ndo in this or that situation\u2014not what would be good for me or my\nfriends. It is as though we forget about locating ourselves as this\nparticular person; we abstract away from our normal self-centered\nperspective and seek the solution to a practical problem that anyone\nsimilarly impartial would also arrive at.\n\nWe can find anticipations or analogues of this idea in ancient\nethics\u2014for example, in Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s\nrecognition that the political community serves the common\ngood rather the interest of some one class or faction; and in the\nStoic belief that the cosmos is governed by a providential force that\nassigns to each of us a distinctive role by which we serve not just\nourselves but also the whole. In the ideal city of Plato\u2019s\nRepublic, the family and private property are abolished\nwithin the elite classes, because these institutions interfere with\nthe development of a common concern for all individuals. It is not\nclear how these ideas can be made to fit within a eudaimonistic\nframework. How can the good of the community serve as the highest\nstandard of evaluation if one\u2019s own good alone is one\u2019s\nhighest end? One way of looking at the history of ethics would be to\nsay that modern ethics salvages the impartialism that occasionally\nappears in ancient ethics, and rightly abandons its attempt to derive\na justification of altruism from a prior commitment to self-interest.\nContemporary eudaimonists, of course, would tell a different story\n(see, for example Annas 1993; LeBar 2013; Russell 2012).\n\nThe notion of impartiality has thus far been described in highly\ngeneral terms, and it is important to see that there are different\nways of making it more concrete. One way of doing so is adopted by\nutilitarians, and more generally, by consequentialists. (The\nutilitarianism of Bentham 1789, Mill 1864, and Sidgwick 1907 holds\nthat one is to maximize the greatest balance of pleasure over\npain\u2014treating pleasure and the absence of pain as the sole\nconstituents of well-being. Consequentialism abstracts away from this\nhedonistic component of utilitarianism; it requires one to maximize\nthe greatest balance of good over bad. See Driver 2012.) In their\ncalculus, no individual\u2019s good is given greater weight or\nimportance than any other\u2019s. Your own good, therefore, is not to\nbe treated by you as having greater weight as a reason than anyone\nelse\u2019s, simply because it is your own good. The well-being of a\nhuman being (or of a sentient creature) is what provides one with a\nreason to act: that is why one has a reason to take one\u2019s own\ngood into consideration in practical thinking. But the same point\napplies equally and with equal force to the well-being of anyone\nelse.\n\nBut that is not the only way of taking the general notion of\nimpartiality and making it more specific. The general idea, as stated\nearlier, is that moral thinking, unlike prudential thinking, is not\nself-centered. One can make this idea more concrete by taking it to\nmean that there is a single set of rules or norms that apply equally\nto all human beings, and so the standard by which one answers the\nquestion, \u201cwhat should I do in this situation?\u201d is the\nstandard by which one answers the question, \u201cwhat should anyone\ndo in this situation?\u201d Someone whose practical reasoning is\nguided by this condition is abiding by an ideal of impartiality. He\nmakes no special exceptions for himself or his friends.\n\nSuppose, for example, that you are a lifeguard and one afternoon you\nmust choose between swimming north to rescue one group and swimming\nsouth to rescue another. The northern group includes your friend, but\nthe southern group, full of strangers, is much larger. The ideal of\nimpartiality described in the previous paragraph does not by itself\ndetermine what one should do in this situation; what it requires is\nsimply that it should make no difference that the lifeguard faced with\nthis dilemma is you (and the northern group includes\nyour friend). What you should do, if you are the\nlifeguard, is what any lifeguard ought to do in that\nsituation. If it is right to take friendship into consideration, when\nmaking this decision, then it would be right for anyone to do so.\n(What would be right, in that case, would be for each individual to\nchoose the good of his or her friend over the good of\nstrangers.)\n\nThe consequentialist has a more radical interpretation of what\nimpartiality means and requires. His ideal of impartiality does not\nallow the lifeguard to take into consideration the fact that by\nswimming north he will be able to save his friend. After all,\nthe well-being of his friend is not made more valuable simply\nbecause that person is his friend. Just as my good is not\nmade more valuable than the good of others simply because it is\nmy good, so too the well-being of my friend deserves no extra\nweight because he is a friend of mine. So, the lifeguard,\naccording to the consequentialist, must choose to save one group\nrather than the other solely on the basis of the greater balance of\ngood over bad. \n\nThe consequentialist will correctly point out that quite often one is\nin a better position to promote one\u2019s own good than that of\nothers. As a rule, I have more knowledge about what is good for me\nthan I have about what is good for strangers. It often requires fewer\nresources for me to benefit myself than to benefit others. I know\nimmediately when I am hungry without having to ask, and I know what\nkind of food I like. But additional steps are needed to find out when\nothers are hungry and which food they like. These sorts of facts about\none\u2019s special relationship to oneself might allow the\nconsequentialist to justify giving somewhat more attention to\none\u2019s own well-being than that of anyone else. Even so, there is\nonly one individual who is me; and the number of other individuals\nwhom I can benefit, if I make the effort, is very large. When all of\nthese factors are taken into consideration, it will often be the case\nthat self-interested reasons ought to give way to altruistic\nmotives.\n\nConsequentialism evidently does not recognize certain ways in which\neach human being has a special relation to her own well-being\u2014a\nrelation different from the one she has to the well-being of others.\nWhen each of us becomes an adult, we are normally charged with the\nspecial responsibility of having to look after our own welfare. Young\nchildren are not expected to be in command of their own lives; they\nare not yet competent to occupy this role. But the point of their\neducation is to train them so that as adults they can be responsible\nfor themselves. A fully mature person is rightly expected by others to\ncare for someone in particular\u2014namely herself. She is given room\nto make decisions about her own life but is not given the same kind\nand degree of authority over the lives of others. If she would like to\ndevote herself to others, she cannot simply do so without receiving\ntheir permission, or without taking other steps that make her entry\ninto their lives permissible. Consequentialism, by contrast, regards\nall adult human beings as equally responsible for the well-being of\nall. It does not take seriously the idea that our social relations are\ngoverned by a division of labor that charges each with a special\nresponsibility for herself\u2014and certain others as well\n(one\u2019s children, one\u2019s friends, and so on.)\n\nAccording to the weaker interpretation of impartiality described\nabove, moral rules reflect this division of labor. (By the\n\u201cweaker interpretation\u201d is meant the thesis that moral\nthinking avoids being self-centered because it upholds a single set of\nrules or norms that apply equally to all human beings.) Consider, for\nexample, the duty we normally have to help others, even when they are\nstrangers. If someone is in need, and asks for your assistance, that\ngives you a reason to help him, and you should do so, provided\nthat compliance with such appeals is not overly burdensome.\nNotice the escape clause: it builds into the duty to aid others a\nrecognition of the importance of each person having a significant\ndegree of control over his own life. Common sense morality assumes\nthat what we owe to others might call for some sacrifice of our own\ngood, but also that in the ordinary business of life the degree of\nsacrifice should fall within certain limits, so that we can make good\nuse of the responsibility we have been given as adults to seek our own\ngood. The balance struck by moral rules between the claims of\nself-interest and the claims of others is what makes it possible for\nthose rules to be recognized and accepted as appropriate. These rules\nleave us free to volunteer to make greater sacrifices; but such\ngreater sacrifices are not required of us except in extraordinary\ncircumstances (wars, disasters, emergencies).\n\nThe three approaches to altruism that we have examined thus far give\nthree rather different answers to the question: \u201cwhy should one\nact for the sake of others and not only for one\u2019s own\nsake?\u201d \n\nEudaimonism replies that those who act for the sake of others are\nbenefited by having an altruistic disposition.\n\nThe consequentialist\u2019s answer begins with the claim that\none\u2019s own well-being ought to be of concern to oneself simply\nbecause it is someone\u2019s well-being; it should not be of\nimportance to oneself simply because it is one\u2019s own well-being.\nThere is, in other words, no reason why a benefit should go to you\nrather than someone else just because you are the one who would be\nreceiving it. Accordingly, if one assumes, as one should, that one\nshould act for one\u2019s own sake, then one has no less a reason to\nact for the good of anyone and everyone else.\n\nIf we adopt a weaker interpretation of impartiality, we see the\njustification of altruism simply by seeing that we have a duty to aid\nother people in certain circumstances. The moral rule that requires us\nto help others is a rule that calls upon us to help them not as a\nmeans to our own good, but simply in virtue of their need. And we see\nthe rule as justified by recognizing that it strikes a proper balance\nbetween our self-concern and the appropriate claims of others.\n\nNotice that both consequentialism and the weaker impartialist position\nare compatible with the eudaimonist\u2019s thesis that having\naltruistic motives is a component of one\u2019s own well-being. What\nthese two forms of impartialism reject is the stronger eudaimonistic\nthesis that one\u2019s ultimate goal should be one\u2019s own\nwell-being and that alone.\n\nThat stronger eudaimonistic thesis and consequentialism stand at\nopposite poles from each other, in the following respect: The first of\nthese poles elevates the self to a position of primacy, since it is\nonly one\u2019s own well-being that constitutes one\u2019s ultimate\ngoal; by contrast, consequentialism, at the opposite extreme, deflates\nthe self to the point where it has no more claim to one\u2019s\nattention than does any other individual. The weak impartialist\nattempts to occupy a middle ground.\n",
