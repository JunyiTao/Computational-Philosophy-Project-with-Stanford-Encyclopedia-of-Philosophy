On-going suspension of judgment in the light of doubt about\na possible solution is not critical thinking (Dewey 1910: 108).\nCritique driven by a dogmatically held political or religious ideology\nis not critical thinking; thus Paulo Freire (1968 [1970]) is using the\nterm (e.g., at 1970: 71, 81, 100, 146) in a more politically freighted\nsense that includes not only reflection but also revolutionary action\nagainst oppression. Derivation of a conclusion from given data using\nan algorithm is not critical thinking.\n",
