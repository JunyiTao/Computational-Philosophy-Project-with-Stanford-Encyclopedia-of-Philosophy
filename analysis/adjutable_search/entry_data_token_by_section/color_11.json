    "main_text": "Theories of Color || Color Relationalism\n2.5 Color Relationalism\n\nOne of the most important developments in recent philosophy of color\nhas been the emergence of a radical relationalist view of colors.\nAverill (1992) proposed a relational view of color, one that involves\na strong modification of the standard dispositional position. He\npresents two arguments against both physicalist and dispositionalist\naccounts, which depend on raising difficult questions for their\ndependence on normal observers and standard viewing conditions. In\ntheir place, he offers an account according to which colors of bodies\nare relational properties. In explanation, he asks us to: \n\n\nSuppose that \u201cyellow\u201d is regarded as a relational term\nhaving two suppressed argument places, one argument takes populations\nas values and ties any instance of being yellow to the normal\nobservers of a population, the other takes environments as values and\nties any instance of being yellow to the optimal viewing conditions of\nan environment. (Averill 1992: 555) \n\n\nCohen (2004, 2009) holds a similar position, though he has produced a\nmore general argument. For Cohen, Color Relationalism is the\nmetaphysical thesis that colors are relational properties of a certain\nsort\u2014relational with respect to perceivers and circumstances of\nviewing. According to Color Relationalism, there are no such\nproperties as blue, red, yellow,\norange, etc. To be more precise, there are no such properties\nas blue simpliciter, red simpliciter, and so on. What there\nare, instead, are relational properties: blue-for-perceiver\nA-in-circumstances C1, red-for-perceiver\nB-in-circumstances C2, yellow-for-perceiver\nD-in-circumstances C3, and so on.\n\nAt the heart of Cohen\u2019s account is a certain argument, which he\ncalls his \u201cMaster Argument\u201d. This argument depends on\npointing out the extent to which the colors things look to have, vary\nwith different viewing conditions, different classes of perceivers,\nand different types of animals. In short, it is built upon the premise\nthat there is a vast range of situations in which there are variations\nin the way something looks, either to the same subject under different\nviewing conditions, or to different subjects under the same\nconditions.\n\nThen follows the crucial question: Can we select one amongst these\nperceptual variants that should be regarded as veridically\nrepresenting the color of the object (where this would mean that the\nother variants are representing the object\u2019s color erroneously)?\nIt is just this question, Cohen suggests, to which it is difficult to\nimagine a well-motivated, principled, and non-question-begging answer,\nand thus leads to the formulation of the Master Argument. Given that\nthere is no well-motivated reason for singling out any single variant\n(at the expense of the others), he argues, an ecumenical\nreconciliation of the variants is preferable to an unmotivated\nstipulation in favor of just one of them. He concludes: the best way\nto implement such an ecumenical reconciliation between apparently\nincompatible variants is to view them as the result of relativizing\ncolors to different values of different parameters (Cohen 2009:\n24).\n\nThe thrust of the Master Argument, powerful as it is, is largely\nnegative. It seems to rebut all objectivist theories of color, whether\nthe objectivist theory is one of the standard forms of color\nrealism\u2014physicalist realism or primitivist realism\u2014or\nwhether it is framed in terms of a disposition to appear, in\ncharacteristic ways, to normal perceivers in standard circumstances.\nOn the face of it, only two candidates remain: Color Relationalism and\nColor Irrealism. Cohen holds that Color Relationalism provides the\nbest solution to the problem outlined, but he concedes that Color\nIrrealism also offers a solution. He thinks that that view ought to be\nrejected, on independent grounds. The argument against Color Irrealism\nis that it is a \u201ctheory of last resort\u201d, one that we\nshould accept only after all other candidates have been rejected, when\nno other alternative remains. The crucial issue between these two\ntheories, it would seem, is when Color Relationalism can account\nadequately for the phenomenology of visual experience. Cohen\u2019s\nresponse to this problem is similar to that of Levin, in her defense\nof Color Dispositionalism (see Maund 2012).\n",
