    "preamble": "\n\n\nFrancis Bacon (1561\u20131626) was one of the leading figures in\nnatural philosophy and in the field of scientific methodology in the\nperiod of transition from the Renaissance to the early modern era. As a\nlawyer, member of Parliament, and Queen's Counsel, Bacon wrote on\nquestions of law, state and religion, as well as on contemporary\npolitics; but he also published texts in which he speculated on\npossible conceptions of society, and he pondered questions of ethics\n(Essays) even in his works on natural philosophy (The\nAdvancement of Learning).\n\n\nAfter his studies at Trinity College, Cambridge and Gray's\nInn, London, Bacon did not take up a post at a university, but instead\ntried to start a political career.

    "main_text": "\n1. Biography\n\n\nFrancis Bacon was born January, 22, 1561, the second child of Sir\nNicholas Bacon (Lord Keeper of the Seal) and his second wife Lady Anne\nCooke Bacon, daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke, tutor to Edward VI and one\nof the leading humanists of the age. Lady Anne was highly erudite: she\nnot only had a perfect command of Greek and Latin, but was also\ncompetent in Italian and French. Together with his older brother\nAnthony, Francis grew up in a context determined by political power,\nhumanist learning, and Calvinist zeal. His father had built a new house\nin Gorhambury in the 1560s, and Bacon was educated there for some seven\nyears; later, along with Anthony, he went to Trinity College, Cambridge\n(1573\u20135), where he sharply criticized the scholastic methods of\nacademic training. Their tutor was John Whitgift, in later life\nArchbishop of Canterbury. Whitgift provided the brothers with classical\ntexts for their studies: Cicero, Demosthenes, Hermogenes, Livy,\nSallust, and Xenophon (Peltonen 2007).  Bacon began his studies\nat Gray's Inn in London in 1576; but from 1577 to 1578 he\naccompanied Sir Amias Paulet, the English ambassador, on his mission in\nParis. According to Peltonen (2007): \n During his stay in France, perhaps in autumn 1577,\nBacon once visited England as the bearer of diplomatic post,\ndelivering letters to Walsingham, Burghley, Leicester, and to the\nQueen herself.\n\nWhen his father died in 1579, he returned to England. Bacon's small\ninheritance brought him into financial difficulties and since his\nmaternal uncle, Lord Burghley, did not help him to get a lucrative\npost as a government official, he embarked on a political career in\nthe House of Commons, after resuming his studies in Gray's Inn. In\n1581 he entered the Commons as a member for Cornwall, and he remained\na Member of Parliament for thirty-seven years. He was admitted to the\nbar in 1582 and in 1587 was elected as a reader at Gray's Inn. His\ninvolvement in high politics started in 1584, when he wrote his first\npolitical memorandum,\nA Letter of Advice to Queen Elizabeth. Right from the\nbeginning of his adult life, Bacon aimed at a revision of natural\nphilosophy and\u2014following his father's example\u2014also tried\nto secure high political office. Very early on he tried to formulate\noutlines for a new system of the sciences, emphasizing empirical\nmethods and laying the foundation for an applied science (scientia\noperativa). This twofold task, however, proved to be too\nambitious to be realized in practice. Bacon's ideas concerning a\nreform of the sciences did not meet with much sympathy from Queen\nElizabeth or from Lord Burghley. Small expectations on this front led\nhim to become a successful lawyer and Parliamentarian. From 1584 to\n1617 (the year he entered the House of Lords) he was an active member\nin the Commons. Supported by Walsingham's patronage, Bacon played a\nrole in the investigation of English Catholics and argued for stern\naction against Mary Queen of Scots. He served on many committees,\nincluding one in 1588 which examined recusants; later he was a member\nof a committee to revise the laws of England. He was involved in the\npolitical aspects of religious questions, especially concerning the\nconflict between the Church of England and nonconformists. In a tract\nof 1591, he tried to steer a middle course in religious politics; but\none year later he was commissioned to write against the Jesuit Robert\nParson (Jardine and Stewart 1999, p. 125), who had attacked English\nsovereignty.\n\n\nFrom the late 1580s onwards, Bacon turned to the Earl of Essex as\nhis patron. During this phase of his life, he particularly devoted\nhimself to natural philosophy. He clearly expressed his position in a\nfamous letter of 1592 to his uncle, Lord Burghley:\n I confess that I have as vast contemplative ends, as I\nhave moderate civil ends: for I have taken all knowledge to be my\nprovince; and if I could purge it of two sorts of rovers, whereof the\none with frivolous disputations, confutations, and verbosities, the\nother with blind experiments and auricular traditions and impostures,\nhath committed so many spoils, I hope I should bring in industrious\nobservations, grounded conclusions, and profitable inventions and\ndiscoveries; the best state of that province. This, whether it be\ncuriosity, or vain glory, or nature, or (if one take it favourably)\nphilanthropia, is so fixed in my mind as it cannot be removed. And I\ndo easily see, that place of any reasonable countenance doth bring\ncommandment of more wits than of a man's own; which is the thing I\ngreatly affect. (Bacon 1857\u201374, VIII, 109)\n\n\nIn 1593 Bacon fell out favor with the queen on account of his\nrefusal to comply with her request for funds from Parliament. Although\nhe did not vote against granting three subsidies to the government, he\ndemanded that these should be paid over a period six, rather than\nthree, years. This led Sir Robert Cecil and Sir Walter Raleigh to argue\nagainst him in Parliament. Bacon's patron, the Earl of Essex, for\nwhom he had already served as a close political advisor and informer,\nwas not able to mollify the queen's anger over the subsidies; and\nall Essex's attempts to secure a high post for Bacon\n(attorney-general or solicitor-general) came to nothing. Nevertheless,\nthe queen valued Bacon's competence as a man of law. He was\ninvolved in the treason trial of Roderigo Lopez and later on in the\nproceedings against the Earl of Essex. In his contribution to the\nGesta Grayorum (the traditional Christmas revels held in\nGray's Inn) of 1594\u20135, Bacon had emphasized the necessity of\nscientific improvement and progress. Since he failed to secure for\nhimself a position in the government, he  considered the\npossibility of giving up politics and concentrating on natural\nphilosophy. It is no wonder, then, that Bacon engaged in many scholarly\nand literary pursuits in the 1590s. His letters of advice to the Earl\nof Rutland and to the Earl of Essex should be mentioned in this\ncontext. The advice given to Essex is of particular importance because\nBacon recommended that he should behave in a careful and intelligent\nmanner in public, above all abstaining from aspiring to military\ncommands. Bacon also worked in this phase of his career for the\nreform of English law. In 1597 his first book was published, the\nseminal version of his Essays, which contained only ten pieces\n(Klein 2004b). His financial situation was still insecure; but his\nplan to marry the rich widow Lady Hatton failed because she was\nsuccessfully courted by Sir Edward Coke. In 1598 Bacon was unable to\nsell his reversion of the Star Chamber clerkship, so that he was\nimprisoned for a short time on account of his debts. His parliamentary\nactivities in 1597\u201398, mainly involving committee work, were\nimpressive; but when the Earl of Essex in 1599 took command of the\nattempt to pacify the Irish rebels, Bacon's hopes sank. Essex did\nnot solve the Irish question, returned to court and fell from grace, as\nBacon had anticipated he would. He therefore lost a valuable patron and\nspokesman for his projects. Bacon tried to reconcile the queen and\nEssex; but when the earl rebelled against the crown in 1601, he could\ndo nothing to help him. The queen ordered Bacon to participate in the\ntreason trial against Essex. In 1601 Bacon sat in Elizabeth's\nlast parliament, playing an extremely active role.\n\n\n           \nBacon looked forward to the next reign and tried to get in contact with\nJames VI of Scotland, Elizabeth's successor. During James'\nreign Bacon rose to power. He was knighted in 1603 and was created a\nlearned counsel a year later. He took up the political issues of the\nunion of England and Scotland, and he worked on a conception of\nreligious toleration, endorsing a middle course in dealing with\nCatholics and nonconformists. Bacon  married Alice Barnhem, the\nyoung daughter of a rich London alderman in 1606. One year later he was\nappointed Solicitor General. He was also dealing with theories of the\nstate and developed the idea, in accordance with Machiavelli, of a\npolitically active and armed citizenry. In 1608 Bacon became clerk of\nthe Star Chamber; and at this time, he made a review of his life,\njotting down his achievements and failures. Though he still was not\nfree from money problems, his career progressed step by step. In the\nperiod from 1603 to 1613 Bacon was not only busy within English\npolitics. He also created the foundations of his philosophical work by\nwriting seminal treatises which prepared the path for the\nNovum Organum and for the Instauratio Magna.\nIn 1613 he became Attorney General and began the rise to the peak of\nhis political career: he became a member of the Privy Council in 1616,\nwas appointed Lord Keeper of the Great Seal the following year\u2014thus achieving the same position as his father\u2014and was granted\nthe title of Lord Chancellor and created Baron of Verulam in 1618. In\n1621, however, Bacon, after being created Viscount of St Alban, was\nimpeached by Parliament for corruption. He fell victim to an intrigue\nin Parliament because he had argued against the abuse of monopolies,\nindirectly attacking his friend, the Duke of Buckingham, who was the\nking's favorite. In order to protect Buckingham, the king\nsacrificed Bacon, whose enemies had accused him of taking bribes in\nconnection with his position as a judge. Bacon saw no way out for\nhimself and declared himself guilty.  His fall was contrived by\nhis adversaries in Parliament and by the court faction, for which he\nwas a scapegoat to save the Duke of Buckingham not only from public\nanger but also from open aggression (Mathews 1996). He lost all his\noffices and his seat in Parliament, but retained his titles and his\npersonal property. Bacon devoted the last five years of his life\u2014the famous quinquennium\u2014entirely to his philosophical\nwork. He tried to go ahead with his huge project, the Instauratio\nMagna Scientiarum; but the task was too big for him to accomplish\nin only a few years. Though he was able to finish important parts of\nthe Instauratio, the proverb, often quoted in his works,\nproved true for himself: Vita brevis, ars longa. He died in\nApril 1626 of pneumonia after experiments with ice.\n2. Natural Philosophy: Struggle with Tradition\n\n\nBacon's struggle to overcome intellectual blockades and the\ndogmatic slumber of his age and of earlier periods had to be fought on\nmany fronts. Very early on he criticized not only Plato, Aristotle and\nthe Aristotelians, but also humanists and Renaissance scholars such as\nParacelsus and Bernardino Telesio.\n\n\nAlthough Aristotle provided specific axioms for every scientific\ndiscipline, what Bacon found lacking in the Greek philosopher's\nwork was a master principle or general theory of science, which could\nbe applied to all branches of natural history and philosophy (Klein\n2003a). For Bacon, Aristotle's cosmology, as well as his theory\nof science, had become obsolete and consequently so too had many of the\nmedieval thinkers who followed his lead. He does not repudiate\nAristotle completely, but he opposes the humanistic interpretation of\nhim, with its emphasis on syllogism and dialectics (scientia\noperativa versus textual hermeneutics) and the metaphysical\ntreatment of natural philosophy in favor of natural forms (or\nnature's effects as structured modes of action, not artifacts),\nthe stages of which correspond\u2014in the shape of a pyramid of\nknowledge\u2014to the structural order of nature itself.\n\n\nIf any\n \u2018modern\u2019 Aristotelians came near to Bacon, it was\nthe Venetian or Paduan branch, represented by Jacopo Zabarella. On the\nother hand, Bacon criticized Telesio, who\u2014in his view\u2014had only halfway succeeded in overcoming Aristotle's\ndeficiencies. Although we find the debate with Telesio in an\nunpublished text of his middle period (De Principiis atque\nOriginibus, secundum fabulas Cupidinis et Coelum or On\nPrinciples and Origins According to the Fables of Cupid and\nCoelum, written in 1612; Bacon V [1889], 461\u2013500), Bacon\nbegan to struggle with tradition as early as 1603. In Valerius\nTerminus (1603?) he already repudiates any mixture of natural\nphilosophy and divinity; he provides an outline of his new method and\ndetermines that the end of knowledge was \n  \u201ca discovery of all\noperations and possibilities of operations from immortality (if it were\npossible) to the meanest mechanical practice\u201d (Bacon III [1887],\n222). He opposes Aristotelian anticipatio naturae, which\nfavored the inquiry of causes to satisfy the mind instead of those\n  \u201cas will direct him and give him light to new experiences and\ninventions\u201d (Bacon III [1887], 232).\n\n\nWhen Bacon introduces his new systematic structure of the\ndisciplines in The Advancement of Learning (1605), he\ncontinues his struggle with tradition, primarily with classical\nantiquity, rejecting the book learning of the humanists, on the grounds\nthat they \u201chunt more after words than matter\u201d (Bacon III\n[1887], 283). Accordingly, he criticizes the Cambridge University\ncurriculum for placing too much emphasis on dialectical and sophistical\ntraining asked of \u201cminds empty and unfraught with matter\u201d\n(Bacon III [1887], 326). He reformulates and functionally transforms\nAristotle's conception of science as knowledge of necessary\ncauses. He rejects Aristotle's logic, which is based on his\nmetaphysical theory, whereby the false doctrine is implied that the\nexperience which comes to us by means of our senses (things as they\nappear) automatically presents to our understanding things as\nthey are. Simultaneously Aristotle favors the application of\ngeneral and abstract conceptual distinctions, which do not conform to\nthings as they exist. Bacon, however, introduces his new conception of\nphilosophia prima as a meta-level for all scientific\ndisciplines.\n\n\nFrom 1606 to 1612 Bacon pursued his work on natural philosophy,\nstill under the auspices of a struggle with tradition. This tendency is\nexemplified in the unpublished tracts Temporis partus\nmasculus, 1603/1608 (Bacon III [1887], 521\u201331),\nCogitata et Visa, 1607 (Bacon III, 591\u2013620),\nRedargutio Philosophiarum, 1608 (III, 557\u201385), and\nDe Principiis atque Originibus\u2026, 1612 (Bacon V [1889],\n461\u2013500). Bacon rediscovers the Pre-Socratic philosophers for\nhimself, especially the atomists and among them Democritus as the\nleading figure. He gives preference to Democritus' natural philosophy\nin contrast to the scholastic\u2014and thus Aristotelian\u2014focus\non deductive logic and belief in authorities. Bacon does not expect\nany approach based on tradition to start with a direct investigation\nof nature and then to ascend to empirical and general knowledge. This\ncriticism is extended to Renaissance alchemy, magic, and astrology\n(Temporis partus masculus), because the \u2018methods\u2019\nof these \u2018disciplines\u2019 are based on occasional insights,\nbut do not command strategies to reproduce the natural effects under\ninvestigation. His criticism also concerns contemporary technical\nliterature, in so far as it lacks a new view of nature and an\ninnovative methodological program. Bacon takes to task the ancients,\nthe scholastics and also the moderns. He not only criticizes Plato,\nAristotle, and Galen for these failings, but also Jean Fernel,\nParacelsus, and Telesio, while praising the Greek atomists and Roger\nBacon.\n\n\nBacon's manuscripts already mention the doctrine of the idols\nas a necessary condition for constituting scientia operativa.\nIn Cogitata et Visa he compares deductive logic as used by the\nscholastics to a spider's web, which is drawn out of its own\nentrails, whereas the bee is introduced as an image of scientia\noperativa. Like a bee, the empiricist, by means of his inductive\nmethod, collects the natural matter or products and then works them up\ninto knowledge in order to produce honey, which is useful for healthy\nnutrition.\n\n\nIn Bacon's follow-up paper, Redargutio\nPhilosophiarum, he carries on his empiricist project by referring\nto the doctrine of twofold truth, while in De Principiis atque\nOriginibus he rejects alchemical theories concerning the\ntransformation of substances in favor of Greek atomism. But in the same\ntext he sharply criticizes his contemporary Telesio for propagating a\nnon-experimental halfway house empiricism. Though Telesio proves to be\na moderate \u2018modern\u2019, he clings to the Aristotelian\nframework by continuing to believe in the quinta essentia and\nin the doctrine of the two worlds, which presupposes two modes of\nnatural law (one mode for the sublunary and another for the superlunary\nsphere).\n3. Natural Philosophy: Theory of the Idols and the System of Sciences\n3.1 The Idols\n\n\nBacon's doctrine of the idols not only represents a stage in\nthe history of theories of error (Brandt 1979) but also functions as\nan important theoretical element within the rise of modern empiricism.\nAccording to Bacon, the human mind is not a tabula rasa.\nInstead of an ideal plane for receiving an image of the world in toto,\nit is a crooked mirror, on account of implicit distortions (Bacon IV\n[1901], 428\u201334). He does not sketch a basic epistemology but\nunderlines that the images in our mind right from the beginning do not\nrender an objective picture of the true objects. Consequently, we have\nto improve our mind, i.e., free it from the idols, before we start any\nknowledge acquisition.\n\n\nAs early as Temporis partus masculus, Bacon warns the\nstudent of empirical science not to tackle the complexities of his\nsubject without purging the mind of its idols: \n\nOn waxen tablets\nyou cannot write anything new until you rub out the old. With the mind\nit is not so; there you cannot rub out the old till you have written in\nthe new. (Farrington 1964, 72)\n\n\nIn Redargutio Philosophiarum Bacon reflects on his method,\nbut he also criticizes prejudices and false opinions, especially the\nsystem of speculation established by theologians, as an obstacle to the\nprogress of science (Farrington 1964, 107), together with any\nauthoritarian stance in scholarly matters.\n\n\nBacon deals with the idols in the Second Book of The Advancement\nof Learning, where he discusses Arts intellectual\n(Invention, Judgment, Memory, Tradition). In his paragraph on judgment\nhe refers to proofs and demonstrations, especially to induction and\ninvention. When he comes to Aristotle's treatment of the\nsyllogism, he reflects on the relation between sophistical fallacies\n(Aristotle, De Sophisticis Elenchis) and the idols (Bacon III\n[1887], 392\u20136). Whereas induction, invention, and judgment\npresuppose \u201cthe same action of the mind\u201d, this is not true\nfor proof in the syllogism. Bacon, therefore, prefers his own\ninterpretatio naturae, repudiating elenches\nas modes of sophistical \u2018juggling\u2019 in order to persuade\nothers in redargutions (\u201cdegenerate and corrupt use\n\u2026 for caption and contradiction\u201d). There is no finding\nwithout proof and no proof without finding. But this is not true for\nthe syllogism, in which proof (syllogism: judgment of the consequent)\nand invention (of the \u2018mean\u2019 or middle term) are distinct.\nThe caution he suggests in relation to the ambiguities in\nelenches is also recommended in face of the idols:\n\nthere is yet a much more important and profound kind of\nfallacies in the mind of man, which I find not observed or enquired at\nall, and think good to place here, as that which of all others\nappertaineth most to rectify judgment: the force whereof is such, as it\ndoth not dazzle or snare the understanding in some particulars, but\ndoth more generally and inwardly infect and corrupt the state thereof.\nFor the mind of man is far from the nature of a clear and equal glass,\nwherein the beams of things should reflect according to their true\nincidence, nay, it is rather like an enchanted glass, full of\nsuperstition and imposture, if it be not delivered and reduced. For\nthis purpose, let us consider the false appearances that are imposed\nupon us by the general nature of the mind \u2026. (Bacon III\n[1887], 394\u20135)\n\n\nBacon still presents a similar line of argument to his reader in\n1623, namely in De Augmentis (Book V, Chap. 4; see Bacon IV\n[1901], 428\u201334). Judgment by syllogism presupposes\u2014in a\nmode agreeable to the human mind\u2014mediated proof, which, unlike\nin induction, does not start from sense in primary objects. In order to\ncontrol the workings of the mind, syllogistic judgment refers to a\nfixed frame of reference or principle of knowledge as the basis for\n\u201call the variety of disputations\u201d (Bacon IV [1901], 491).\nThe reduction of propositions to principles leads to the middle term.\nBacon deals here with the art of judgment in order to assign a\nsystematic position to the idols. Within this art he distinguishes the\n\u2018Analytic\u2019 from the detection of fallacies (sophistical\nsyllogisms). Analytic works with \u201ctrue forms of consequences in\nargument\u201d (Bacon IV [1901], 429), which become faulty by variation and\ndeflection. The complete doctrine of detection of fallacies, according\nto Bacon, contains three segments:\n\n Sophistical fallacies, \nFallacies of interpretation, and \n False appearances or Idols.\n\n\nConcerning (1) Bacon praises Aristotle for his excellent handling of\nthe matter, but he also mentions Plato honorably. Fallacies of\ninterpretation (2) refer to \u201cAdventitious Conditions or Adjuncts\nof Essences\u201d, similar to the predicaments, open to physical or\nlogical inquiry. He focuses his attention on the logical handling when\nhe relates the detection of fallacies of interpretation to the wrong\nuse of common and general notions, which leads to sophisms. In the last\nsection (3) Bacon finds a place for his idols, when he refers to the\ndetection of false appearances as \n\nthe deepest fallacies of the\nhuman mind: For they do not deceive in particulars, as the others do,\nby clouding and snaring the judgment; but by a corrupt and ill-ordered\npredisposition of mind, which as it were perverts and infects all the\nanticipations of the intellect. (IV, 431)\n\nIdols are productions of the human imagination (caused by the crooked\nmirror of the human mind) and thus are nothing more than\n\u201cuntested generalities\u201d (Malherbe 1996, 80).\n\n\nIn his Preface to the Novum Organum Bacon promises the\nintroduction of a new method, which will restore the senses to their\nformer rank (Bacon IV [1901], 17f.), begin the whole labor of the mind\nagain, and open two sources and two distributions of learning,\nconsisting of a method of cultivating the sciences and another of\ndiscovering them. This new beginning presupposes the discovery of the\nnatural obstacles to efficient scientific analysis, namely seeing\nthrough the idols, so that the mind's function as the subject of\nknowledge acquisition comes into focus (Brandt 1979, 19).\n\n\nAccording to Aphorism XXIII of the First Book, Bacon makes a\ndistinction between the Idols of the human mind and the Ideas of the\ndivine mind: whereas the former are for him nothing more than\n\u201ccertain empty dogmas\u201d, the latter show \u201cthe true\nsignatures and marks set upon the works of creation as they are found\nin nature\u201d (Bacon IV [1901], 51).\n3.1.1 Idols of the Tribe\n\n\nThe Idols of the Tribe have their origin in the production of false\nconcepts due to human nature, because the structure of human\nunderstanding is like a crooked mirror, which causes distorted\nreflections (of things in the external world).\n3.1.2 Idols of the Cave\n\n\nThe Idols of the Cave consist of conceptions or doctrines which are\ndear to the individual who cherishes them, without possessing any\nevidence of their truth. These idols are due to the preconditioned\nsystem of every individual, comprising education, custom, or accidental\nor contingent experiences.\n3.1.3 Idols of the Market Place\n\n\nThese idols are based on false conceptions which are derived from\npublic human communication. They enter our minds quietly by a\ncombination of words and names, so that it comes to pass that not only\ndoes reason govern words, but words react on our understanding.\n3.1.4 Idols of the Theatre\n\n\nAccording to the insight that the world is a stage, the Idols of the\nTheatre are prejudices stemming from received or traditional\nphilosophical systems. These systems resemble plays in so far as they\nrender fictional worlds, which were never exposed to an experimental\ncheck or to a test by experience. The idols of the theatre thus have\ntheir origin in dogmatic philosophy or in wrong laws of\ndemonstration.\n\n\nBacon ends his presentation of the idols in Novum Organum,\nBook I, Aphorism LXVIII, with the remark that men should abjure and\nrenounce the qualities of idols, \u201cand the understanding [must be]\nthoroughly freed and cleansed\u201d (Bacon IV [1901], 69). He\ndiscusses the idols together with the problem of information gained\nthrough the senses, which must be corrected by the use of experiments\n(Bacon IV [1901], 27).\n3.2 System of Sciences\n\n\nWithin the history of occidental philosophy and science, Bacon\nidentifies only three revolutions or periods of learning: the heyday of\nthe Greeks and that of the Romans and Western Europe in his own time\n(Bacon IV [1901], 70ff.). This meager result stimulated his ambition\nto establish a new system of the sciences. This tendency can already be\nseen in his early manuscripts, but is also apparent in his first major\nbook, The Advancement of Learning. In this work Bacon presents\na systematic survey of the extant realms of knowledge, combined with\nmeticulous descriptions of deficiencies, leading to his new\nclassification of knowledge. In The Advancement (Bacon III\n[1887], 282f.) a new function is given to philosophia prima,\nthe necessity of which he had indicated in the Novum Organum,\nI, Aphorisms LXXIX\u2013LXXX (Bacon IV [1901], 78\u20139). In both\ntexts this function is attributed to philosophia naturalis,\nthe basis for his concept of the unity of the sciences and thus of\nmaterialism.\n\n\nNatural science is divided by Bacon into physics and metaphysics.\nThe former investigates variable and particular causes, the latter\nreflects on general and constant ones, for which the term form\nis used. Forms are more general than the four Aristotelian\ncauses and that is why Bacon's discussion of the forms of\nsubstances as the most general properties of matter is the last step\nfor the human mind when investigating nature. Metaphysics is distinct\nfrom philosophia prima. The latter marks the position in the\nsystem where general categories of a general theory of science are\ntreated as (1) universal categories of thought, (2) relevant for all\ndisciplines. Final causes are discredited, since they lead to\ndifficulties in science and tempt us to amalgamate theological and\nteleological points of doctrine. At the summit of Bacon's pyramid\nof knowledge are the laws of nature (the most general principles). At\nits base the pyramid starts with observations, moves on to invariant\nrelations and then to more inclusive correlations until it reaches the\nstage of forms. The process of generalization ascends from natural\nhistory via physics towards metaphysics, whereas accidental\ncorrelations and relations are eliminated by the method of exclusion.\nIt must be emphasized that metaphysics has a special meaning\nfor Bacon. This concept (1) excludes the infinity of individual\nexperience by generalization with a teleological focus and (2) opens\nour mind to generate more possibilities for the efficient application\nof general laws.\n3.3 Matter Theory and Cosmology\n\n\nAccording to Bacon, man would be able to explain all the processes\nin nature if he could acquire full insight into the hidden structure\nand the secret workings of matter (P\u00e9rez-Ramos 1988,  101).\nBacon's conception of structures in nature, functioning according\nto its own working method, concentrates on the question of how natural\norder is produced, namely by the interplay of matter and motion. In\nDe Principiis atque Originibus, his materialistic stance with\nregard to his conception of natural law becomes evident. The\nSummary Law of Nature is a virtus\n(matter-cum-motion) or power in accordance with matter theory, or\n\nthe force implanted by God in these first particles, form the\nmultiplication thereof of all the variety of things proceeds and is\nmade up. (Bacon V [1889], 463)\n\nSimilarly, in De Sapientia Veterum he attributes to this\nforce an \n appetite or instinct of primal matter; or to speak\nmore plainly, the natural motion of the atom; which is indeed the\noriginal and unique force that constitutes and fashions all things out\nof matter. (Bacon VI [1890], 729)\n\nSuffice it to say here that Bacon, who did not reject mathematics in\nscience, was influenced by the early mathematical version of chemistry\ndeveloped in the 16th century, so that the term\n\u2018instinct\u2019 must be seen as a keyword for his theory of\nnature. The natural philosopher is urged to inquire into the\n appetites and inclination of things by which all that\nvariety of effects and changes which we see in the works of nature and\nart is brought about. (Bacon III [1887], 17\u201322; V [1889],\n422\u20136 and 510ff.: Descriptio Globi Intellectualis; cf.\nIV [1901], 349)\n\nBacon's theory of active or even vivid force in matter accounts for\nwhat he calls Cupid in De Principiis atque Originibus (Bacon\nV [1889], 463\u20135). Since his theory of matter aims at an\nexplanation of the reality which is the substratum of appearances, he\ndigs deeper than did the mechanistic physics of the 17th\ncentury (Gaukroger 2001, 132\u20137). Bacon's ideas concerning\nthe quid facti of reality presuppose the distinction \n between understanding how things are made up and of\nwhat they consist, \u2026 and by what force and in what manner they\ncome together, and how they are transformed. (Gaukroger 2001,\n137)\n\n\nThis is the point in his work where it becomes obvious that he tries\nto develop an explanatory pattern in which his theory of matter, and\nthus his atomism, are related to his cosmology, magic, and\nalchemy.\n\nIn De Augmentis, Bacon not only refers to Pan and his\nnymphs in order to illustrate the permanent atomic movement in matter\nbut in addition revives the idea of magic in a \n\u2018honourable meaning\u2019 as \n\nthe knowledge of the universal consents of\nthings \u2026. I \u2026 understand [magic] as the science which\napplies the knowledge of hidden forms to the production of wonderful\noperations; and by uniting (as they say) actives with passives,\ndisplays the wonderful works of nature. (Bacon IV [1901],\n366\u20137: De Augmentis III.5)\n\n\nBacon's notion of form is made possible by integration into\nhis matter theory, which (ideally) reduces the world of appearances to\nsome minimal parts accessible and open to manipulation by the\nknower/maker. In contrast to Aristotle, Bacon's knowing-why type\nof definition points towards the formulation of an efficient\nknowing-how type (P\u00e9rez-Ramos 1988, 119). In this sense a\nconvergence between the scope of definition and that of causation takes\nplace according to a \u2018constructivist epistemology\u2019. The\nfundamental research of Graham Rees has shown that Bacon's\nspecial mode of cosmology is deeply influenced by magic and\nsemi-Paracelsian doctrine. For Bacon, matter theory is the basic\ndoctrine, not classical mechanics as it is with Galileo. Consequently,\nBacon's purified and modified versions of chemistry, alchemy, and\nphysiology remain primary disciplines for his explanation of the\nworld.\n\n\nAccording to Rees, the Instauratio Magna comprises two\nbranches: (1) Bacon's famous scientific method, and (2) his\nsemi-Paracelsian world system as \u201ca vast, comprehensive system\nof speculative physics\u201d (Rees 1986, 418). For (2) Bacon conjoins\nhis specific version of Paracelsian cosmic chemistry to Islamic\ncelestial kinematics (especially in Alpetragius [al-Bitruji]; see Zinner 1988, 71). The chemical\nworld system is used to support Bacon's explanation of celestial\nmotion in the face of contemporary astronomical problems (Rees 1975b,\n161f.). There are thus two sections in Bacon's Instauratio,\nwhich imply the modes of their own explanation.\n\n\nBacon's speculative cosmology and matter theory had been\nplanned to constitute Part 5 of Instauratio Magna. The theory\nput forward refers in an eclectic vein to atomism, criticizes\nAristotelians and Copernicans, but also touches on Galileo, Paracelsus,\nWilliam Gilbert, Telesio, and Arabic astronomy.\n\n\nFor Bacon, \u2018magic\u2019 is classified as applied science,\nwhile he generally subsumes under \u2018science\u2019 pure science\nand technology. It is never identified with black magic, since it\nrepresents the \u201cultimate legitimate power over nature\u201d\n(Rees 2000, 66). Whereas magia was connected to crafts in the\n16th and 17th centuries, Bacon's science\nremains the knowledge of forms in order to transform them into\noperations. Knowledge in this context, however, is no longer\nexclusively based on formal proof.\n\n\nBacon's cosmological system\u2014a result of thought\nexperiments and speculation, but not proven in accordance with the\ninductive method\u2014presupposes a finite universe, a geocentric\nplenum, which means that the earth is passive and consists of\ntangible matter. The remaining universe is composed of active\nor pneumatic matter. Whereas the interior and tangible matter\nof the earth is covered by a crust which separates it from the\npneumatic heaven, the zone between earth and the \u201cmiddle region\nof the air\u201d allows a mixture of pneumatic and tangible matter,\nwhich is the origin of organic and non-organic phenomena. Bacon speaks\nhere of \u201cattached spirit\u201d (Rees 1986, 418\u201320), while\notherwise he assumes four kinds of free spirit: air and terrestrial\nfire, which refer to the sublunary realm; ether and sidereal fire,\nwhich are relevant to the celestial realm. Ether is explained as the\nmedium in which planets move around the central earth. Air and ether,\nas well as watery non-inflammable bodies, belong to Bacon's first\ngroup of substances or to the Mercury Quaternion.\n\n\nTerrestrial fire is presented as the weak variant of sidereal fire;\nit joins with oily substances and sulphur, for all of which Bacon\nintroduces the Sulphur Quaternion. These quaternions comprise\nantithetical qualities: air and ether versus fire and sidereal fire.\nThe struggle between these qualities is determined by the distance from\nthe earth as the absolute center of the world system. Air and ether\nbecome progressively weaker as the terrestrial and sidereal fire grow\nstronger. The quaternion theory functions in Bacon's thought as a\nconstructive element for constituting his own theory of planetary\nmovement and a general theory of physics. This theory differs from all\nother contemporary approaches, even though Bacon states that\n\u201cmany theories of the heavens may be supposed which agree well\nenough with the phenomena and yet differ with each other\u201d (Bacon\nIV [1901], 104). The diurnal motion of the world system (9th\nsphere) is driven by sympathy; it carries the heavens westward around\nthe earth. The sidereal fire is powerful and, accordingly, sidereal\nmotion is swift (the stars complete their revolution in 24 hours).\nSince the sidereal fire becomes weaker if it burns nearer to the earth,\nthe lower planets move more slowly and unevenly than the higher ones\n(in this way Bacon, like Alpetragius, accounts for irregular planetary\nmovement without reference to Ptolemy's epicycle theory). He\napplies his theory of consensual motion to physics generally (e.g.,\nwind and tides) and thus comes into conflict with Gilbert's\ndoctrine of the interstellar vacuum and Galileo's theory of the\ntides (for Bacon, the cycle of tides depends on the diurnal motion of\nthe heavens but, for Galileo, on the earth's motion).\n\n\nWith quaternion theory we see that, in the final analysis, Bacon was\nnot a mechanist philosopher. His theory of matter underwent an\nimportant transformation, moving in the direction of\n\u2018forms\u2019, which we would nowadays subsume under biology or\nthe life sciences rather than under physics. Bacon distinguishes\nbetween non-spiritual matter and spiritual matter. The latter, also\ncalled \u2018subtle matter\u2019 or \u2018spirit\u2019, is more\nreminiscent of Leibniz' \u2018monads\u2019 than of mechanically\ndefined and materially, as well as spatially, determined atoms. The\nspirits are seen as active agents of phenomena; they are endowed with\n\u2018appetition\u2019 and \u2018perception\u2019 (Bacon I [1889],\n320\u201321: Historia Vitae et Mortis; see also V, 63:\nSylva Sylvarum, Century IX:\n\u201cIt is certain that\nall bodies whatsoever, though they have no sense, yet they have\nperception: for when one body is applied to another, there is a kind of\nelection to embrace that which is agreeable, and to exclude or expel\nthat which is ingrate\u201d).\n\n\nThese spirits are never at rest. In the Novum Organum,\nthen, Bacon  rejected the \u201cexistence of eternal and\nimmutable atoms and the reality of the void\u201d (Kargon 1966, 47).\nHis new conception of matter was therefore \u201cclose to that of the\nchemists\u201d in the sense of Bacon's semi-Paracelsian\ncosmology (Rees 2000, 65\u201369). The careful natural philosopher\ntries to disclose the secrets of nature step by step; and therefore\n he says of his method:  \u201cI propose to establish\nprogressive stages of certainty\u201d (Bacon IV [1901], 40: Novum\nOrganum, Preface). This points towards his inductive procedure and\nhis method of tables, which is a complicated mode of induction by\nexclusion. It is necessary because nature hides her secrets. In\nAphorism XIX of Book I in his Novum Organum Bacon writes:\n\nThere are and can be only two ways of searching into and\ndiscovering truth. The one flies from the senses and particulars to the\nmost general axioms, and from these principles, the truth of which it\ntakes for settled and immoveable, proceeds to judgment and to the\ndiscovery of middle axioms. And this way is now in fashion. The other\nderives axioms from the senses and particulars, rising by gradual and\nunbroken ascent, so that it arrives at the most general axioms last of\nall. This is the true way, but as yet untried. (Bacon IV [1901],\n50)\n\n\nThe laws of nature, which Bacon intended to discover by means of his\nnew method, were expressed in the  \u2018forms\u2019, in which\nthe \u2018unbroken ascent\u2019 culminates. Through these forms the\nnatural philosopher understands the general causes of phenomena\n(Kargon 1966, 48). In his endeavor to learn more about the secret\nworkings of nature, Bacon came to the conclusion that the atomist\ntheory could not provide sufficient explanations for the \u201creal\nparticles, such as really exist\u201d (Bacon IV [1901], 126:\nNovum Organum, II.viii), because he thought that the\nimmutability of matter and the void (both necessary assumptions for\natomism) were untenable. His language turned from that of Greek physics\nto the usage of contemporary chemists. This is due to his insight that\n\u201csubtlety of investigation\u201d is needed, since our senses are\ntoo gross for the complexity and fineness of nature, so that method has\nto compensate for the shortcomings of our direct comprehension. Only\nmethod leads to the knowledge of nature: in Sylva Sylvarum,\nCentury I.98  Bacon deals explicitly with the question of the\nasymmetrical relationship between man's natural instrument (i.e.,\nthe senses) and the intricacy of nature's structures and\nworkings.\n\n\nBacon distinguishes \u2018animate\u2019 or vital spirits, which\nare continuous and composed of a substance similar to fire, from\nlifeless or inanimate spirits, which are cut off and resemble air: the\nspirits interact with gross matter through chemical processes (Bacon\nIV, 195\u20136 (Novum Organum, II.xl)). These spirits\nhave two different desires: self-multiplication and attraction of like\nspirits. According to Kargon (1966, 51):\n\n Bacon's later\ntheory of matter is one of the interaction of gross, visible parts of\nmatter and invisible material spirits, both of which are physically\nmixed.\n\nSpirits interact with matter by means of concoction, colliquation and\nother non-mechanical chemical processes, so that Bacon's scientific\nparadigm differs from Descartes' mechanist theory of matter in\nhis Principia Philosophiae (1644), which presupposes res\nextensa moving in space.  Bacon's theory of matter is thus\nclosely related to his speculative philosophy:\n\n The distinction between tangible and\npneumatic matter is the hinge on which the entire speculative system\nturns. (Rees 1996, 125; Paracelsus had already stated that\nknowledge inheres in the object: see Shell 2004,  32)\n\n\nBacon's theory of matter in its final version was more\ncorpuscular than atomist (Clericuzio 2000, 78). Bacon's\nparticles are semina rerum:  they are endowed  with\npowers,  which make a variety of motions possible and allow the\nproduction of all possible forms. These spirits are constitutive for\nBacon's  theory of matter. As material, fine substances,\ncomposed of particles, combined from air and fire, they can, as we have\nseen, be either inanimate or animate. Bacon thus suggests a corpuscular\nand chemical chain of being:\n\n\ninanimate objects\n\u2192\ninaugurate spirits\n\n\nvegetables\n\u2192\ninanimate + vital spirits\n\n\nanimals\n\u2192\nvital spirits\n\n\n\n\nSmall wonder, then, that Bacon's spirits are indispensable for\nhis conception of physiology: \n the vital spirits regulate all vegetative functions of\nplants and animals. Organs responsible for these functions, for\ndigestion, assimilation, etc., seem to act by perception, mere\nreaction to local stimuli, but these reactions are coordinated by the\nvital spirit. These functions flow from the spirit's airy-flamy\nconstitution. The spirit has the softness of air to receive\nimpressions and the vigour of fire to propagate its actions. (Rees in\nOFB VI, 202\u20133) \n\nThis physiological stratum of Bacon's natural philosophy was\ninfluenced by his semi-Paracelsian cosmology (on Paracelsus see\nM\u00fcller-Jahncke 1985, 67\u201388), which Graham Rees (Rees and\nUpton 1984, 20\u20131) has reconstructed from the extant parts of the\nInstauratio Magna. Detailed consideration therefore has to be\ngiven to Bacon's theory of the \u2018quaternions\u2019.\n\n\nBacon's speculative system is a hybrid based on different sources\nwhich provided him with seminal ideas: e.g., atomism, Aristotelianism,\nArabic astronomy, Copernican theory, Galileo's discoveries, the works\nof Paracelsus, and Gilbert. In his theory he combines astronomy,\nreferring to Alpetragius (see Dijksterhuis 1956, 237\u201343; Rees\nand Upton 1984, 26; Gaukroger, 2001, 172\u20135; and see Grant\n1994, 533\u201366, for discussion of the cosmology of Alpetragius),\nand chemistry (Rees 1975a, 84\u20135): \n[i]t was partly designed to fit a kinematic skeleton\nand explain, in general terms, the irregularities of planetary motion\nas consequences of the chemical constitution of the universe. (Rees\n1975b, 94) \n\nBacon had no explanation for the planetary retrogressions and saw the\nuniverse as a finite and geocentric plenum, in which the earth\nconsists of the two forms of matter (tangible and pneumatic). The\nearth has a tangible inside and is in touch with the surrounding\nuniverse, but through an intermediate zone. This zone exists between\nthe earth's crust and the pure pneumatic heavens; it reaches some\nmiles into the crust and some miles into air. In this zone, pneumatic\nmatter mixes with tangible matter, thus producing \u2018attached\nspirits\u2019, which must be distinguished from \u2018free\nspirits\u2019 outside tangible bodies.  Bacon's four kinds of free\nspirits are relevant for his \u2018quaternion theory\u2019:\n\n\n\u2013 air\n\n\u2013 ether\n\n\n\n\nsublunary\n\ncelestial\n\n\n\u2013 terrestrial fire\n\n\u2013 sidereal fire\n\n\n\n\nThe planets move around the earth in the ether (a tenuous kind of\nair), which belongs to the \u2018mercury quaternion\u2019: it\nincludes watery bodies and mercury. Terrestrial fire is a weakened\nform of sidereal fire. It is related to oily substances and sulphur,\nand constitutes the \u2018sulphur quaternion\u2019. The two\nquaternions oppose each other: air/ether vs. fire/sidereal fire. Air\nand ether loose power when terrestrial and sidereal fires grow more\nenergetic\u2014Bacon's sulphur and mercury are not principles in the\nsense of Paracelsus, but simply natural substances. The Paracelsian\nprinciple of salt is excluded by Bacon and the substance, which plays\na role only in the sublunary realm, is for him a compound of natural\nsulphur and mercury (Rees and Upton 1984, 25).\n\n\n           \nBacon used his quaternion theory for his cosmology, which differs\ngreatly from other contemporary systems (Rees 2000, 68):\n\nthe diurnal motion turns\nthe heavens about the earth towards the west;\nunder powerful sidereal\nfire (i.e., principle of celestial motion) the motion is swift: the\nrevolution of the stars takes place in twenty-four hours;\nunder weaker sidereal\nfire\u2014nearer to the earth\u2014planets move more slowly and\nmore erratic.\n\n\n\nBacon, who tried to conceive of a unified physics, rejected\ndifferent modes of motion in the superlunary and in the sublunary world\n(Bacon I [1889], 329). He did not believe in the existence of\nthe (crystalline) spheres nor in the macrocosm-microcosm analogy. He\nrevised Paracelsian ideas thoroughly. He rejected the grounding of his\ntheories in Scripture and paid no attention at all to Cabbalistic and\nHermetic tendencies (Rees 1975b, 90\u20131). But he extended the\nexplanatory powers of the quaternions to earthly phenomena such as wind\nand tides.\n\nBacon's two systems were closely connected:\n\nSystem 1: (The Two Quaternions) explained and comprised the\ncosmological aspect of his natural philosophy.\nSystem 2: (Theory of Matter) explained terrestrial nature, that is,\nit \u201cdealt with the manifold changes in the                 \nanimal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms of the frontier zone between\nthe celestial heavens and the Earth's interior\u201d (Rees\n1996, 130; the two tables are taken from Rees). \n\n\n\nSystem 2 depends on System 1, since explanations for terrestrial\nthings were subordinated to explanations of the cosmological level. The\ntable of System 2 shows Bacon's matter theory. His quaternion\ntheory is relevant for System 1. System 2 is explained in terms of\n\u2018intermediates\u2019, which combine the qualities of the items\nin one quaternion with their opposites in the other.\n\n\nBacon's system is built in a clear symmetrical way: each\nquaternion has four segments, together eight and there are four types\nof intermediates. Thus, the system distinguishes twelve segments in\nall. He wanted to explain all natural phenomena by means of this\napparatus:\n\n\nThe Two Quaternions\n\n\n Sulphur Quaternion \nMercury Quaternion\n\n\n\nTangible\nSubstances \n(With Attached Spirits) \n\nSulphur (subterranean) \nMercury (subterranean)\n\n\nOil and oily\ninflammable \nsubstances\n(terrestrial) \n\nWater and \u2018crude\u2019\nnon-inflammable\nsubstances (terrestrial)\n\n\n\n\nPneumatic Substances\n \n\nTerrestrial fire\n(sublunary) \n Air\n(sublunary)\n\n\nSidereal fire\n(planets) \nEther (medium of the planets) \n\n\n\nThe Theory of Matter\nSulphur QuaternionIntermediatesMercury Quaternion\n\nTangible Substances (with attached spirits)\nSulphur (subterranean) Salts (subterranean and in organic beings)\nMercury (subterranean)\n\n\nOil and oily inflammable substances  (terrestrial) \nJuices of animals and plants \nWater and \u2018crude\u2019 non-inflammable substances (terrestrial)\n\n\nPneumatic substances\n Terrestrial fire (sublunary) \n Attached animate and inanimate spirits (in tangible bodies)\n Air (sublunary)\n\n\nSidereal fire (planets) \n Heaven of the fixed stars \nEther (medium of planets)\n\n\n\n\nThere are two principal intermediates:\n\n\n \nThe fire-air intermediates\n\n\u2193\u2193\n\n\n\u2018attached\u2019 animate spirits\ninanimate spirits\n\n\n\u2193\u2193\n\n\n only in living bodies\n in all tangible bodies (including living bodies)\n\n\n\n\nBacon's bi-quaternion theory necessarily refers to the\nsublunary as well as to the superlunary world. Although the quaternion\ntheory is first mentioned in Thema Coeli (1612; see Bacon V\n[1889], 547\u201359), he provides a summary in his Novum\nOrganum (Bacon II [1887], 50):\n it has not been ill observed by the chemists in their\ntriad of first principles, that sulphur and mercury run through the\nwhole universe \u2026 in these two one of the most general consents\nin nature does seem to be observable. For there is consent between\nsulphur, oil and greasy exhalation, flame, and perhaps the body of a\nstar. So is there between mercury, water and watery vapors, air, and\nperhaps the pure and intersiderial ether. Yet these two quaternions or\ngreat tribes of things (each within its own limits) differ immensely\nin quantity of matter and density, but agree very well in\nconfiguration. (Bacon IV [1901], 242\u20133; see also V [1889],\n205\u20136; for tables of the two quaternions and Bacon's theory of\nmatter see Rees 1996, 126, 137; Rees 2000, 68\u20139) \n\nBacon regarded his cosmological\nworldview as a system of anticipations, which was open to revision in\nlight of further scientific results based on the inductive method\n(Rees 1975b, 171). It was primarily a qualitative system, standing\naside from both mathematical astronomers and Paracelsian chemists. It\nthus emphasized the priority which he gave to physics over mathematics\nin his general system of the sciences.\n\n\nBacon's two quaternions and his matter theory provide a\nspeculative framework for his thought, which was open to the future\nacquisition of knowledge and its technical application. His Nova\nAtlantis can be understood as a text which occupies an\nintermediate position between his theory of induction and his\nspeculative philosophy (Klein 2003c; Price 2002).\n\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that Bacon's speculative\nsystem was his way out of a dilemma which had made it impossible for\nhim to finish his Instauratio Magna. His turn towards\nspeculation can only be interpreted as an intellectual anticipation\nduring an intermediate phase of the history of science, when a gigantic\namount of research work was still to be accomplished, so that empirical\ntheories could neither be established nor sufficiently guaranteed.\nSpeculation in Bacon's sense can therefore be seen as a\npreliminary means of explaining the secrets of nature until methodical\nresearch has caught up with our speculations. The speculative stance\nremains a relative and intermediate procedure for the \u2018man of\nscience\u2019.\n4. Scientific Method: The Project of the Instauratio Magna\n\nThe Great Instauration, Bacon's main work, was\npublished in 1620 under the title: Franciscus de Verulamio Summi\nAngliae Cancellaris Instauratio magna. This great work remained a\nfragment, since Bacon was only able to finish parts of the planned\noutline. The volume was introduced by a Prooemium, which gives\na general statement of the purpose, followed by a Dedication\nto the King (James I) and a Preface, which is a summary of all\n\u201cdirections, motifs, and significance of his life-work\u201d\n(Sessions 1996, 71). After that, Bacon printed the plan of the\nInstauratio, before he turned to the strategy of his research\nprogram, which is known as Novum Organum Scientiarum.\nAltogether the 1620 book constitutes the second part of Part II of the\nInstauratio, the first part of which is represented by De\nAugmentis and Book I of The Advancement of Learning. When\nBacon organized his Instauratio, he divided it into six parts,\nwhich reminded contemporary readers of God's work of the six days\n(the creation), already used by writers like Guillaume Du Bartas\n(La Sepmaine, ou Cr\u00e9ation du Monde, 1579, transl. by\nJoshua Sylvester, Bartas His Devine Weekes &\nWorkes, 1605) and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola\n(Heptaplus, 1489).\n\n\nBacon sees nature as a labyrinth, whose workings cannot be\nexclusively explained by reference to \u201cexcellence of wit\u201d\nand \u201crepetition of chance experiments\u201d: \n\nOur steps\nmust be guided by a clue, and see what way from the first perception of\nthe sense must be laid out upon a sure plan. (Bacon IV [1901],\n18)\n\n\nBacon's Plan of the Work runs as follows (Bacon IV\n[1901], 22):\n\nThe Divisions of the Sciences.\nThe New Organon; or Directions concerning the Interpretation of\nNature.\nThe Phenomena of the Universe; or a Natural and Experimental\nHistory for the foundation of Philosophy.\nThe Ladder of Intellect.\nThe Forerunners; or Anticipations of the New\nPhilosophy.\nThe New Philosophy; or Active Science.\n\n\n\nPart 1 contains the general description of the sciences including\ntheir divisions as they presented themselves in Bacon's time.\nHere he aimed at a distinction between what was already invented and\nknown in contrast to \u201cthings omitted which ought be there\u201d\n(Bacon IV [1901], 23). This part could be taken from The\nAdvancement of Learning (1605) and from the revised and enlarged\nversion De Dignitate et Augmentis Scientiarum (1623).\n\n\nPart 2 develops Bacon's new method for scientific\ninvestigation, the Novum Organum, equipping the intellect to\npass beyond ancient arts and thus producing a radical revision of the\nmethods of knowledge; but it also introduces a new epistemology and a\nnew ontology. Bacon calls his new art Interpretatio Naturae,\nwhich is a logic of research going beyond ordinary logic, since his\nscience aims at three inventions: of arts (not arguments), of\nprinciples (not of things in accordance to principles), and of\ndesignations and directions for works (not of probable reasons). The\neffect Bacon looks for is to command nature in action, not to overcome\nan opponent in argument. The Novum Organum is the only part of\nthe Instauratio Magna which was brought near to\ncompletion.\n\n\nPart 3 was going to contain natural and experimental history or the\nrecord of the phenomena of the universe. According to De Augmentis\nScientarum (Bacon IV [1901], 275), natural history is split up\ninto narrative and inductive, the latter of which is supposed \u201cto\nminister and be in order to the building up of\nPhilosophy\u201d. These functional histories support human memory\nand provide the material for research, or the factual\nknowledge of nature, which must be certain and reliable. Natural\nhistory starts from and emphasizes the subtlety of nature or her\nstructural intricacy, but not the complexity of philosophical systems,\nsince they have been produced by the human mind. Bacon sees this part\nof Instauratio Magna as a foundation for the reconstruction of\nthe sciences in order to produce physical and metaphysical knowledge.\nNature in this context is studied under experimental conditions, not\nonly in the sense of the history of bodies, but also as a history of\nvirtues or original passions, which refer to the desires of matter\n(Rees 1975a). This knowledge was regarded by Bacon as a preparation\nfor Part 6, the Second Philosophy or Active Science,\nfor which he gave only the one example of Historia Ventorum\n(1622); but\u2014following his plan to compose six prototypical\nnatural histories\u2014he also wrote Historia vitae et\nmortis(1623) and the Historia densi, which was left in\nmanuscript. The text, which develops the idea of Part 3, is called\nParasceve ad Historiam Naturalem et Experimentalem.\n\n\nPart 4, which Bacon called The Ladder of Intellect or\nScala Intellectus, was intended to function as a link between\nthe method of natural history and that of Second Philosophy/Active\nScience. It consists not only of the fragment Filum labyrinthi\n(Bacon III [1887], 493\u2013504), but also includes the\nAbecedarium nouum naturae (OFB XIII, xxi), which was\nplanned as a preface to all of section 4 \u201c[to] demonstrate the\nwhole process of the mind\u201d (OFB XIII, xxii). Filum\nlabyrinthi is similar to, but not identical with, Cogitata et\nVisa. Speaking of himself in an authorial voice, Bacon reflects on\nthe state of science and derives his construction of a research program\nfrom the gaps and deficiencies within the system of disciplines:\nsciences of the future should be examined and further ones should be\ndiscovered. Emphasis must be laid on new matter (not on controversies).\nIt is necessary to repudiate superstition, zealous religion, and false\nauthorities. Just as the Fall was not caused by knowledge of nature,\nbut rather by moral knowledge of good and evil, so knowledge of natural\nphilosophy is for Bacon a contribution to the magnifying of God's\nglory, and, in this way, his plea for the growth of scientific\nknowledge becomes evident.\n\n\nPart 5 deals with the forerunners or anticipations of the new\nphilosophy, and Bacon emphasizes that the \u2018big machinery\u2019\nof the Instauratio Magna needs a good deal of time to be\ncompleted. Anticipations are ways to come to scientific inferences\nwithout recourse to the method presented in the Novum Organum.\nMeanwhile, he has worked on his speculative system, so that portions of\nhis Second Philosophy are treated and finished: De Fluxu et Refluxu\nMaris and Thema Coeli. For this part of the Great\nInstauration, texts are planned that draw philosophical\nconclusions from collections of facts which are not yet sufficient for\nthe use or application of Bacon's inductive method.\n\n\nPart 6 was scheduled to contain Bacon's description of the new\nphilosophy, as the last part of his Great Instauration; but\nnothing came of this plan, so that there is no extant text at all from\nthis part of the project.\n5. Scientific Method: Novum Organum and the Theory of Induction\n\n\nAlready in his early text Cogitata et Visa (1607) Bacon\ndealt with his scientific method, which became famous under the name of\ninduction. He repudiates the syllogistic method and defines\nhis alternative procedure as one \u201cwhich by slow and faithful toil\ngathers information from things and brings it into understanding\u201d\n(Farrington 1964, 89). When later on he developed his method in\ndetail, namely in his Novum Organum (1620), he still noted\nthat \n\n[of] induction the logicians seem hardly to have taken any\nserious thought, but they pass it by with a slight notice, and hasten\nto the formulae of disputation. I on the contrary reject demonstration\nby syllogism \u2026. (Bacon IV [1901], 24)\n\n\nBacon's method appears as his conceptual plot, \n applied to all stages of knowledge, and at every phase\nthe whole process has to be kept in mind. (Malherbe 1996, 76)\n\nInduction implies ascending to axioms, as well as a descending to\nworks, so that from axioms new particulars are gained and from these\nnew axioms. The inductive method starts from sensible experience and\nmoves via natural history (providing sense-data as guarantees) to\nlower axioms or propositions, which are derived from the tables of\npresentation or from the abstraction of notions. Bacon does not\nidentify experience with everyday experience, but presupposes that\nmethod corrects and extends sense-data into facts, which go together\nwith his setting up of tables (tables of presence and of absence and\ntables of comparison or of degrees, i.e., degrees of absence or\npresence). \u201cBacon's antipathy to simple enumeration as the\nuniversal method of science derived, first of all, from his preference\nfor theories that deal with interior physical causes, which are not\nimmediately observable\u201d (Urbach 1987, 30; see: sect. 2).  The\nlast type can be supplemented by tables of counter-instances, which\nmay suggest experiments: \n To move from the sensible to the real requires the\ncorrection of the senses, the tables of natural history, the\nabstraction of propositions and the induction of notions. In other\nwords, the full carrying out of the inductive method is\nneeded. (Malherbe 1996, 85)\n\n\nThe sequence of methodical steps does not, however, end here,\nbecause Bacon assumes that from lower axioms more general ones can be\nderived (by induction). The complete process must be understood as the\njoining of the parts into a systematic chain. From the more general\naxioms Bacon strives to reach more fundamental laws of nature\n(knowledge of forms), which lead to practical deductions as new\nexperiments or works (IV, 24\u20135). The decisive instruments in this\nprocess are the middle or \u2018living axioms,\u2019 which mediate\nbetween particulars and general axioms. For Bacon, induction can only\nbe efficient if it is eliminative by exclusion, which goes beyond the\nremit of induction by simple enumeration. The inductive method helps\nthe human mind to find a way to ascertain truthful knowledge.\n\nNovum Organum, I, Aphorism CXV (Bacon IV [1901], 103) ends\nthe \u201cpulling down\u201d of \u201cthe signs and causes of the\nerrors\u201d within the sciences, achieved by means of three\nrefutations, which constituted the condition for a rational\nintroduction of method: refutation of \u2018natural human\nreason\u2019 (idols); refutation of \u2018demonstrations\u2019\n(syllogisms) and refutation of \u2018theories\u2019 (traditional\nphilosophical systems).\n\n\nThe Second Part of the Novum Organum deals with\nBacon's rule for interpreting nature, even if he provides no\ncomplete or universal theory. He contributes to the new philosophy by\nintroducing his tables of discovery (Inst.\nMagna, IV), by presenting an example of particulars\n(Inst. Magna, II), and by observations on history\n(Inst. Magna, III). It is well known that he worked\nhard in the last five years of his life to make progress on his natural\nhistory, knowing that he could not always come up to the standards of\nlegitimate interpretation.\n\n\nBacon's method presupposes a double starting-point: empirical\nand rational. True knowledge is acquired if we want to proceed from a\nlower certainty to a higher liberty and from a lower liberty to a\nhigher certainty. The rule of certainty and liberty in Bacon converges\nwith his repudiation of the old logic of Aristotle, which determined\ntrue propositions by the criteria of generality, essentiality, and\nuniversality. Bacon rejects anticipatio naturae\n(\u201canticipation of nature\u201d) in favor of interpretatio\nnaturae (\u201cinterpretation of nature\u201d), which starts\nwith the collecting of facts and their methodical (inductive)\ninvestigation, shunning entanglement in pure taxonomy (as in Ramism),\nwhich establishes the order of things (Urbach 1987, 26; see also \nFoucault 1966 [1970]), but does not produce knowledge. For\nBacon, making is knowing and knowing is making (Bacon IV [1901],\n109\u201310). In accordance with the maxim \u201ccommand nature\n\u2026 by obeying her\u201d (Sessions 1996, 136; Gaukroger 2001,\n139ff.), the exclusion of superstition, imposture, error, and\nconfusion are obligatory. Bacon introduces variations into \u201cthe\nmaker's knowledge tradition\u201d as the discovery of the forms\nof a given nature lead him to develop his method for acquiring factual\nand proven knowledge.\n\n\nBacon argues against \u201canticipation of nature\u201d, which he\nregards as a conservative method, leading to theories that recapitulate\nthe data without producing new ones conducive to the growth of\nknowledge. Moreover, such theories are considered to be final, so that\nthey are never replaced.\n\n\n\u201cAnticipation of nature\u201d resembles\n\u201cconventionalism\u201d (Urbach 1987, 30\u201341), according to\nwhich theories refer to unobservable entities (e.g., atoms, epicycles).\nThe theories are \u201ccomputation rules\u201d or \u201cinference\nlicences\u201d within this given framework, which give explanations\nand predictions of particular kinds of observable events. The\nconventionalist acceptance of making predictions concerning future\nevents cannot be separated from the question of probability.\nBacon's procedure of knowledge acquisition goes against\n\u201cconventionalism\u201d, because \u201canticipation of\nnature\u201d does not reject authoritative and final speculations\nconcerning \u201cunobservables\u201d and because it permits \u201cad\nhoc adjustments\u201d.  Nowadays, however,\n philosophers would not accept the idea that just\nbecause we can't observe something directly \u2026 it follows that\nthere is no such thing. (Huggett 2010, 82. See also Von\nWeizs\u00e4cker and Juilfs 1958, pp.67\u201370; Rae 1986 [2000], 1\u201327\nand passim)\n\n\nConventionalist deep-level theories of the world are chosen from among\nalternative ways of observing phenomena. Although theories revealing\nthe world structure are not directly provable or disprovable by means\nof observation or experiment, conventionalists might maintain their\nchosen theory even in the face of counter-evidence. They therefore\navoid changes of theory. Any move to a new theory is not taken on the\nbasis of new evidence, but because a new theory seems to be simpler,\nmore applicable or more beautiful. Laws of nature are generally\nunderstood as being unrevisable (O'Hear 1995, 165).  The famous\ndebate, sparked by Thomas Kuhn, on paradigmatic and non-paradigmatic\nscience and theory is relevant here. Bacon's position\u2014open to\nscientific progress\u2014is nearer to Kuhn than to Duhem or\nPoincar\u00e9. For Bacon, \u201canticipation of nature\u201d (as\na mode of \u201cconventionalism\u201d) produces obstacles to the\nprogress of knowledge. Traditional methods shun speculation concerning\nthings which are not immediately visible; Bacon's speculation,\nhowever, is an element of \u201cinterpretation of nature\u201d. He\npresupposes hypothetical theories, but these do not go beyond the\ncollected data. His acceptance of hypotheses is connected with his\nrejection of\n\u201canticipation of nature\u201d. Thus, hypotheses are\nrelated to the axioms of \u201cinterpretation of nature\u201d, which\ngo beyond the original data. The amount of established facts is not\nidentical with that of possible data (Gillies 1998, 307).\nAnticipation is rejected, only if it \u201cflies from the senses and\nparticulars to the most general axioms\u201d (OFB XI, xxv). \nBecause of the dangers of premature generalization, Bacon is careful\nabout speculations and rigorously rejects any dogmatic defense of them\nand the tendency to declare them infallible.\n\n\n\u2026the philosophy that we now possess clutches to its breast\ncertain tenets with which (if we look into it carefully) they want\nwholly to conceive men that nothing difficult, nothing with real power\nand influence over nature, should be expected from art or human\neffort; [\u2026] These things, if we examine them minutely, tend\nwholly towards a wicked circumscription of human power and an\nintentional and unnatural despair which not only confounds the\npresages of hope but breaks every nerve and spur of industry, and\nthrows away the chances afforded by experience itself\u2014while all\nthey care about is that their art be considered perfect, expending\ntheir effort to achieve the most foolish and bankrupt glory of having\nit believed that whatever has not been found out or understood so far\ncannot be found out or understood in the future. (OFB XI,\n141) \n\nBacon sees nature as an extremely subtle complexity, which affords all\nthe energy of the natural philosopher to disclose her secrets.\n\n\nFor him, new axioms must be larger and wider than the\nmaterial from which they are taken. At the same time,\n\u201cinterpretation of nature\u201d must not leap to remote axioms.\nIn terms of his method, he rejects general ideas as simple\nabstractions from very few sense perceptions. Such abstract words may\nfunction as conventions for organizing \u201cnew observations\u201d,\nbut only in the sense of means for taxonomical order. Such a sterile\nprocedure is irrelevant for \u201cinterpretation of nature\u201d,\nwhich is not final or infallible and is based on the insight that\nconfirming hypotheses do not provide strict proofs. Bacon's method is\ntherefore characterized by openness: \n\nNevertheless, I do not\naffirm that nothing can be added to what I prescribe; on the contrary,\nas one who observes the mind not only in its innate capacity but also\ninsofar as it gets to grips with things, it is my conviction that the\nart of discovering will grow as the number of things discovered will\ngrow. (OFB, XI, 197)\n\nPeter Urbach's commentary exactly underlines Bacon's openness:\n\n He believed that theories\nshould be advanced to explain whatever data were available in a\nparticular domain. These theories should preferably concern the\nunderlying physical, causal mechanisms and ought, in any case, to go\nbeyond the data which generated them. They are then tested by drawing\nout new predictions, which, if verified in experience, may confirm the\ntheory and may eventually render it certain, at least in the sense that\nit becomes very difficult to deny. (Urbach 1987, 49) \n\nBacon was no seventeenth-century Popperian. Rather, on account of his\ntheory of induction, he was:\n\nthe first great theorist of experimentalism\u201d: \u201cthe\nfunction of experiment was both to test theories and to establish\nfacts\u201d (Rees, in OFB XI, xli). \n\nEncyclopaedic repetition with an Aristotelian slant is being displaced\nby original compilation in which deference to authority plays no part\nwhatever. Individual erudition is being dumped in favour of collective\nresearch. Conservation of traditional knowledge is being discarded in\nthe interest of a new, functional realization of natural\nhistory, which demands that\nlegenda\u2014things worth reading\u2014be supplanted by\nmaterials which will form the basis of a thoroughgoing attempt to\nimprove the material conditions of the human race. (Rees, in OFB\nXI, xlii)\n\n\n\nForm is for Bacon a structural constituent of a natural entity or a\nkey to its truth and operation, so that it comes near to natural law,\nwithout being reducible to causality. This appears all the more\nimportant, since Bacon\u2014who seeks out exclusively causes which\nare necessary and sufficient for their effects\u2014rejects\nAristotle's four causes (his four types of explanation for a complete\nunderstanding of a phenomenon) on the grounds that the distribution\ninto material, formal, efficient, and final causes does not work well\nand that they fail to advance the sciences (especially the final,\nefficient, and material causes). Consider again the passage\nquoted in Section 3.3: \n There are and can be only two ways of searching into\nand discovering truth. The one flies from the senses and particulars\nto the most general axioms, and from these principles, the truth of\nwhich it takes for settled and immovable, proceeds to judgment and to\nthe discovery of middle axioms.  And this way is now in fashion. The\nother derives axioms from the senses and particulars, rising by a\ngradual and unbroken ascent, so that it arrives at the most general\naxioms at last. This is the true way, but as yet untried. (Bacon IV\n[1901], 50: Novum Organum, I, Aphorism XIX).\n\n\nSince for Bacon the formal necessity of the syllogism does not\nsuffice to set up first principles, his method comprises two basic\ntasks: (1) the discovery of forms, and (2) the transformation of\nconcrete bodies. The discovery from every case of generation and motion\nrefers to a latent process according to which efficient and material\ncauses lead to forms; but there is also the discovery of latent\nconfigurations of bodies at rest and not in motion (Bacon IV [1901],\n119\u201320).\n\n\nBacon's new mode of using human understanding implies a\nparallelism between striving towards human power and constituting human\nknowledge. Technical know-how leads to successful operations, which\nconverge with the discovery of forms (P\u00e9rez-Ramos 1988, 108;\nBacon IV [1901], 121). To understand the workings of nature\npresupposes an arrangement of facts which makes the investigative\nanalysis of cause and effect possible, especially by means of new\nexperiments. At this point the idea of scientia\noperativa comes in again, since the direction for a true and\nperfect rule of operation is parallel to the discovery of a true form.\nBacon's specific non-Aristotelian Aristotelianism\n(P\u00e9rez-Ramos 1988, 113, 115) is one of the main features of his\ntheory. Other indispensable influences on Bacon, apart from a modified\nversion of Aristotle, are critically assessed Hermeticism, rhetoric\n(Vickers) and alchemy (Rees).\n\n\nTwo kinds of axioms correspond to the following division of\nphilosophy and the sciences: the investigation of forms or\nmetaphysics; and the investigation of efficient cause and\nmatter, which leads to the latent process and configuration in\nphysics. Physics itself is split up by Bacon into\nMechanics, i.e., the practical, and Magic, i.e., the\nmetaphysical.\n\n\nNowadays the view that Bacon \u201cmade little first-hand\ncontribution to science\u201d (Hesse 1964, 152) no longer coincides\nwith the opinion that we have to assume an underestimation of the\n\u201cplace of hypothesis and mathematics\u201d in his work (Urban\n1987; Sessions 1999, 139; Rees 1986). But there were few doubts in\nthe past that Bacon \u201cencouraged detailed and methodical\nexperimentation\u201d (Hesse 1964, 152); and he did this on account\nof his new inductive method, which implied the need for negative\ninstances and refuting experiments. Bacon saw that confirming instances\ncould not suffice to analyze the structure of scientific laws, since\nthis task presupposed a hypothetical-deductive system, which, according\nto Lisa Jardine, is closely connected to \u201cthe logical and\nlinguistic backgrounds from which Bacon's New Logic proceeds\n\u2026\u201d (Sessions 1999, 140; Jardine 1974, 69ff.).\n\n\nBacon's interpretation of nature uses \u201cTables\nand Arrangements of Instances\u201d concerning the natural phenomena\nunder investigation, which function as a necessary condition for\ncracking the code of efficient causation. His prerogative\ninstances are not examples or phenomena simply taken from nature\nbut rather imply information with inductive potential which show\npriority conducive to knowledge or to methodological relevance when\ninserted into tables. The instances do not represent the order of\nsensible things, but instead express the order of qualities (natures).\nThese qualities provide the working basis for the order of abstract\nnatures. Bacon's tables have a double function: they are\nimportant for natural history, collecting the data on bodies\nand virtues in nature; and they are also indispensable for\ninduction, which makes use of these data.\n\n\nAlready in Temporis Partus Masculus (1603) Bacon had\ndisplayed a \u201cfacility of shrewd observation\u201d (Sessions\n1999, 60) concerning his ideas on induction. In his Novum\nOrganum the nature of all human science and knowledge was seen by\nhim as proceeding most safely by negation and exclusion, as opposed to\naffirmation and inclusion. Even in his early tracts it was clear to\nBacon that he had to seek a method of discovering the right forms, the\nmost well known of which was heat (Novum Organum II,\nAph. XI\u2013XII) or \u201cthe famous trial investigation of the form\nof heat\u201d (Rees 2000, 66; see Bacon IV [1901], 154\u20135).\n\n\nIn his \u201c[m]ethod of analysis by exclusion\u201d (Sessions\n1999, 141), negation proved to be \u201cone of Bacon's strongest\ncontributions to modern scientific method\u201d (Wright 1951, 152).\nMost important were his tables of degrees and of exclusion. They were\nneeded for the discovery of causes, especially for supreme causes,\nwhich were called forms. The method of induction works in two\nstages:\n\nLearned experience from the known to the unknown has to be\nacquired, and the tables (of presence, absence, degrees) have to be set\nup before their interpretation can take place according to the\nprinciple of exclusion. After the three tables of the first\npresentation have been judged and analyzed, Bacon declares the\nFirst Vintage or the first version of the interpretation of\nnature to be concluded.\nThe second phase of the method concentrates on the process of\nexclusion. The aim of this procedure is the reduction of the empirical\ncharacter of experience, so that the analysis converges with an anatomy\nof things. Here, too, tables of presence and of absence are set up. The\nresearch work proper consists of finding the relationship of the two\nnatures of qualities. Here exclusion functions as the process of\ndetermination. Bacon's method starts from material determination\nin order to establish the formal determination of real causes, but does\nnot stop there, because it aims at the progressive generalization of\ncauses. Here, again, the central element of the inductive method is the\nprocedure of exclusion.\n\n\n\nForms, as the final result of the methodical procedure, are:\n\nnothing more than those laws and determinations of absolute\nactuality which govern and constitute any simple nature, as heat,\nlight, weight, in every kind of matter and subject that is susceptible\nof them (Bacon IV [1901], 145\u20136);\nThey are not identical with natural law, but with definitions of\nsimple natures (elements) or ultimate ingredients of things from which\nthe basic material structure has been built (Gaukroger 2001,\n140). Forms are the structures constituted by the elements in nature\n(microphysics). This evokes a cross-reference to Bacon's atomism,\nwhich has been called the \u201cconstructivist component\u201d\n(P\u00e9rez-Ramos 1988, 116) of his system, including an alchemical\ntheory about basic kinds of matter. He aims at \u201cunderstanding\nthe basic structures of things \u2026 as a means to transforming\nnature for human purposes\u201d (Gaukroger 2001, 140; Clericuzio\n2000, 78ff.); and thus he \u201cends\u201d the unfinished Novum\nOrganum with a list of things which still have to be achieved or\nwith a catalogue of phenomena which are important and indispensable\nfor a future natural history.\n\n\nHistorians of science, with their predilection for mathematical\nphysics, used to criticize Bacon's approach, stating that\n\u201cthe Baconian concept of science, as an inductive science, has\nnothing to do with and even contradicts today's form of\nscience\u201d (Malherbe 1996, 75). In reaching this verdict, however,\nthey overlooked the fact that a natural philosophy based on a theory of\nmatter cannot be assessed on the grounds of a natural philosophy or\nscience based on mechanics as the fundamental discipline. One can\naccount for this chronic mode of misunderstanding as a specimen of the\nparadigmatic fallacy (Gaukroger 2001, 134ff.; see Rees 1986).\n\n\nBacon came to the fundamental insight that facts cannot be\ncollected from nature, but must be constituted by methodical\nprocedures, which have to be put into practice by scientists in order\nto ascertain the empirical basis for inductive generalizations. His\ninduction, founded on collection, comparison, and exclusion of factual\nqualities in things and their interior structure, proved to be a\nrevolutionary achievement within natural philosophy, for which no\nexample in classical antiquity existed. His scala intellectus\nhas two contrary movements \u201cupwards and downwards: from\naxiomata to experimenta and opera and back\nagain\u201d (P\u00e9rez-Ramos 1988, 236). Bacon's induction\nwas construed and conceived as an instrument or method of discovery.\nAbove all, his emphasis on negative instances for the procedure of\ninduction itself can claim a high importance with regard to knowledge\nacquisition and has been acclaimed as an innovation by scholars of our\ntime. Some have detected in Bacon a forerunner of Karl Popper in\nrespect of the method of falsification. Finally, it cannot be denied\nthat Bacon's methodological program of induction includes aspects\nof deduction and abstraction on the basis of negation and exclusion.\nContemporary scholars have praised his inauguration of the theory of\ninduction. This theory has been held in higher esteem since the 1970s\nthan it was for a long period before (see the work of Rees, Gaukroger\nand P\u00e9rez-Ramos 1988, 201\u201385). Nevertheless, it is\ndoubtful that Bacon's critics, who were associated with the\ntraditions of positivism and analytical philosophy, acquired sufficient\nknowledge of his writings to produce solid warrants for their\ncriticisms (Cohen 1970, 124\u201334; Cohen 1985, 58ff.; on the\ngeneral problem of induction see, e.g.,  Hempel 1966; Swinburne\n(ed.) 1974; Lambert and Brittan 1979 [1987]).  In comparison to the\nneglect of Bacon in the twentieth century, a more recent and deeper\nassessment of his work has arisen in connection with the \u201cOxford\nFrancis Bacon\u201d project, which was launched in the late 1990s by\nGraham Rees, who directed it until his death in 2009; it is now under\nthe general editorship of Brian Vickers.\n6. Science and Social Philosophy\n\n\nIn Bacon's thought we encounter a relation between science and\nsocial philosophy, since his ideas concerning a utopian transformation\nof society presuppose an integration into the social framework of his\nprogram concerning natural philosophy and technology as the two forms\nof the maker's knowledge. From his point of view, which was\ninfluenced by Puritan conceptions, early modern society has to make\nsure that losses caused by the Fall are compensated for, primarily by\nman's enlargement of knowledge, providing the preconditions for a\nnew form of society which combines scientia nova and\nthe millennium, according to the prophecy of Daniel 12:4 (Hill 1971,\n85\u2013130). Science as a social endeavor is seen as a collective\nproject for the improvement of social structures. On the other hand, a\nstrong collective spirit in society may function as a conditio sine\nqua non for reforming natural philosophy. Bacon's famous\nargument that it is wise not to confound the Book of Nature with the\nBook of God comes into focus, since the latter deals with God's\nwill (inscrutable for man) and the former with God's work, the\nscientific explanation or appreciation of which is a form of Christian\ndivine service. Successful operations in natural philosophy and\ntechnology help to improve the human lot in a way which makes the\nhardships of life after the Fall obsolete. It is important to note that\nBacon's idea of a\u2014to a certain extent\u2014Christian\nsociety by no means conveys Christian pessimism in the vein of\npatristic thinkers but rather displays a clear optimism as the result\nof compounding the problem of truth with the scope of human freedom and\nsovereignty (Brandt 1979, 21).\n\n\nWith regard to Bacon's Two Books\u2014the Book of God and\nthe Book of Nature\u2014one has to keep in mind that man, when given\nfree access to the Book of Nature, should not content himself with\nmerely reading it. He also has to find out the names by which things\nare called. If man does so, not only will he be restored to his status\na noble and powerful being, but the Book of God will also lose\nimportance, from a traditional point of view, in comparison to the Book\nof Nature. This is what Blumenberg referred to as the \u201casymmetry\nof readability\u201d (Blumenberg 1981, 86\u2013107). But the process\nof reading is an open-ended activity, so that new knowledge and the\nexpansion of the system of disciplines can no longer be restricted by\nconcepts such as the completeness and eternity of knowledge (Klein\n2004a, 73).\n\n\nAccording to Bacon, the Book of God refers to his will, the Book of\nNature to his works. He never gives a hint in his works that he has\nconcealed any message of unbelief for the sophisticated reader; but he\nemphasized: (1) that religion and science should be kept separate\nand,  (2) that they were nevertheless complementary to each other.\nFor Bacon, the attack of theologians on human curiosity cannot be\nfounded on a rational basis. His statement that \u201call knowledge is\nto be limited by religion, and to be referred to use and action\u201d\n(Bacon III [1887], 218)  does not express a general verdict on\ntheoretical curiosity, but instead provides a normative framework for\nthe tasks of science in a universal sense. Already in the dedicatory\nletter to James I in his Advancement of Learning, Bacon\nattacks \u201cthe zeal and jealousy of divines\u201d (Bacon III, \n264) and in his manuscript Filum Labyrinthi of 1607, he\n\u201cthought  \u2026 how great opposition and prejudice\nnatural philosophy had received by superstition, and the immoderate and\nblind zeal of religion\u201d (Bacon VI [1863], 421). As Calvin\nhad done long before him in the Institutes, Bacon stated that\nsince God created the physical world, it was a legitimate object of\nman's knowledge, a conviction which he illustrated with the\nfamous example of King Solomon in The Advancement of Learning\n(Zagorin 1999, 49\u201350; see also Kocher 1953,\n27\u20138). Bacon praises Solomon's wisdom, which seems to\nbe more like a game than an example of man's God-given thirst for\nknowledge: \n\nThe glory  of God is to conceal a thing, but the\nglory of the king is to find it out; as if, according to the innocent\nplay of children, the Divine Majesty took delight to hide his works, to\nthe end to have them found out; and as if kings could not obtain a\ngreater honour than to be God's playfellows in that game,\nconsidering the great commandment of wits and means, whereby nothing\nneedeth to be hidden from them. (Bacon III [1887], 299;\nBlumenberg, 1973, 196\u2013200)\n\nFrom this perspective, the punishment of mankind on account of the\nvery first disobedience by Adam and Eve can be seen in a different\nlight from that of theological interpretations. In Bacon's view, this\ndisobedience and its consequences can be remedied in two ways: (1) by\nreligion and moral imperatives, and (2) by advancement in the arts and\nsciences: \u201cthe purpose in advancing arts and sciences is the\nglory of God and the relief of man's estate\u201d (Wormald 1993,\n82).\n\n\nThe two remedies, which are interconnected with the moral dimension,\nrefer to the advancement of learning and religion. All three together\n(the advancement of learning, religion, and morality) are combined in\nsuch a way that they promote each other mutually; consequently, limited\noutlooks on coping with life and knowledge are ruled out completely in\nthese three fields.\n7. The Ethical Dimension in Bacon's Thought\n\n\nThe ethical dimension of Bacon's thought has been underrated\nby generations of scholars. Time and again a crude utilitarianism has\nbeen derived from Book I, Aphorism 1 of the Novum Organum;\nthis cannot, however, withstand a closer analysis of his thought. Since\nBacon's philosophy of science tries to answer the question of how\nman can overcome the deficiencies of earthly life resulting from the\nFall, he enters the realm of ethical reflection. The improvement of\nmankind's lot by means of philosophy and science does not start\nfrom a narrow utilitarian point of view, involving sheer striving for\nprofit and supporting the power or influence of select groups of men,\nbut instead emphasizes the construction of a better world for mankind,\nwhich might come into existence through the ascertaining of truths\nabout nature's workings (Bacon III [1887], 242). Thus, the\nperspective of the universal in Bacon's ethical thought is given\npredominance. The range of science and technology in their ethical\nmeaning transcends the realm of the application of tools and/or\ninstruments, in so far as the aim is the transformation of whole\nsystems. Since causality and finality can interact on the basis of\nhuman will and knowledge, a plurality of worlds becomes feasible\n(Bacon V [1889], 506\u20137). Moral philosophy is closely connected\nto ethical reflections on the relationship between the nature of\nvirtues\u2014habitual or innate?\u2014and their use in life,\nprivately and collectively. Any application of the principles of virtue\npresupposes for Bacon the education of the mind, so that we learn what\nis good and what should be attained (Gaukroger 2006, 204\u20135 and\npassim):\n\n\nThe main and primitive division of moral knowledge seemeth to\nbe into the Exemplar or Platform of Good, and the Regimen of Culture of\nthe Mind; the one describing the nature of good, the other prescribing\nrules how to subdue, apply, and accommodate the will of man\nthereunto (Bacon III [1887], 419).\n\n\n\nSo, already in his Advancement of Learning Bacon\nstudied the nature of good and distinguished various kinds of good. He\ninsisted on the individual's duty to the public. Private moral\nself-control and the concomitant obligations are relevant for behavior\nand action in society. One's ethical persona is\nconnected to morality by reference to acceptable behaviour. Though what\nwe can do may be limited, we have to muster our psychological powers\nand control our passions when dealing with ourselves and  with\nothers. We need to apply self-discipline and rational assessment, as\nwell as restraining our passions, in order to lead an active moral life\nin society.\n\n\nThus, for Bacon, the acquisition of knowledge does not simply\ncoincide with the possibility of exerting power. Scientific knowledge\nis a condition for the expansion and development of civilization.\nTherefore, knowledge and charity cannot be kept separate:\n\n\nI humbly pray \u2026 that knowledge being now discharged of\nthat venom which the serpent infused into it, and which makes the mind\nof man to swell, we may not be wise above measure and sobriety, but\ncultivate truth in charity\u2026. Lastly, I would address one general\nadmonition to all; that they consider what are the true ends of\nknowledge, and that they seek it not either for pleasure of the mind,\nor for contention, or for superiority to others, or for profit, or\nfame, or power, or any of these inferior things; but for the benefit\nand use of life; and that they perfect and govern it in charity. For it\nwas from the lust of power that the angels fell, from lust of knowledge\nthat man fell; but of charity there can be no excess, neither did angel\nor man ever come in danger by it (Bacon IV [1901], 20f.:\nInstauratio Magna, Preface).\n\n\n\nFinally, the view that Bacon's Nova Atlantis\n\u201cconcerns a utopian society that is carefully organized for the\npurposes of scientific research and virtuous living\u201d (Urbach\n1988, 10) holds true for his entire life's work. In Nova\nAtlantis, social, political, and scholarly life are all organized\naccording to the maxim of efficiency; but the House of Solomon is a\nseparate and highly esteemed institution for research, which\nnevertheless is closely connected to the overall system of Bensalem. In\nhis utopian state, Bacon presents a thoroughgoing collective life in\nsociety and science, both of which are based on revealed religion.\nReligion\u2014Christian in essence\u2014is not dogmatic, but it\ninstills into the people of Bensalem veneration for the wise and\nmorally exemplary members of society, and\u2014which is of the utmost\nimportance\u2014the strictest sense of discipline (Gaukroger 2001,\n128\u201330). Discipline is indispensable for those involved in the\nreligious life as well as for the researchers, since both must proceed\nmethodically. The isomorphic structures of nature and science, on the\none hand, society and religion, on the other, prescribe patterns of\npolitical procedure, social processes, and religious attitudes, which\novercome any craving for individuality. If religion and scientific\nresearch are both shown as truthful in Bensalem, then, according to\nBacon, the imagination functions as a means of illustrating scientific\nrevelation: \u201cBacon's purpose is \u2026 to show that\nscientific research properly pursued is not inconsonant with religious\npropriety and social stability\u2026\u201d (Bierman 1963, 497). The\nscientists in Bensalem are sacred searchers for truth: ethics,\nreligion, and science merge. Bacon's parabolic strategy, which we\nshould not separate from the power of the idols, enables him to make\nmuch of his trick of introducing new ideas like a smuggler: his colored\nwares are smuggled into the minds of his readers by being visualized in\nterms of sacred and highly symbolic rituals (Peltonen 1996, 175).\nScience and religion are separated in Nova Atlantis, but they are also\ninterrelated through the offices of the society of Bensalem. What Bacon\nobviously wants to make clear to his readers is that the example of\nBensalem should free them from any fear that scientific progress will\nlead to chaos and upheaval. This crucial point has made by J\u00fcrgen\nMittelstrass, who understands Bacon's Nova Atlantis as a\nutopia and regards utopias as \n\nblueprints of practical reason,\nnot of theoretical, that is: they set in exactly there, where the early\nmodern idea of progress  appears meagre with regards to the\ncontents: within ethics and political theory. (Mittelstrass\n1960, 369)\n",
