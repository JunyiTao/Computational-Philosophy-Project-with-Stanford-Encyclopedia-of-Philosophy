They accept that, while our knowledge of our own\nmental states is direct, our knowledge of the mental states of others\nmust proceed by reasoning from what we observe\u2014the other\u2019s\nbehavior\u2014to what we cannot observe\u2014the other\u2019s\nmental\n states.[3]\n The idea that the mind of another is not directly observable is one\nthat seems common to many philosophers. As early as the fifth century\nAD, St. Augustine writes: \u201cFor even when a living body is moved,\nthere is no way opened to our eyes to see the mind, a thing which\ncannot be seen by the eyes\u2026\u201d (De Trinitate 140;\ncf. Descartes 1641, Second Meditation; and Berkeley 1710, Principle\n148) The idea that we should have direct knowledge of another\u2019s\nmental states has also come under fire more recently by Colin McGinn,\nwho writes that direct perceptual reports specifying the mental states\nof another \u201cseem definitely wrong\u201d (1984: 123, n. 2; cf.\nPlantinga 1966: 441).\n\nDirect knowledge is often associated with perception and it is this,\nas we have just seen, that so many philosophers have rejected in\nassociation with other minds. While our knowledge of the world of\nthings around us is taken to come about through perception, it has\nbeen thought that knowledge of another\u2019s mind cannot come about\nby this\n means.[4]\n Nonetheless, we find Nathalie Duddington writing, \u201cMy object in\nthe present paper is to maintain that our knowledge of other minds is\nas direct and immediate as our knowledge of physical things\u201d\n(1919: 147). It is not at all clear that philosophers at the time paid\nmuch attention to this very interesting paper, but philosophers today\nhave found in Duddington\u2019s work a precursor for an idea that has\ncome to be taken very seriously\u2014at least in some\n circles.[5]\n\nMany analytic philosophers in the past few decades have written in\ndefense of the idea that our knowledge of other minds comes about\nthrough perception (e.g., McDowell 1978 and 1982, Dretske 1969 and\n1976, Cassam 2007, McNeil 2012, Stout 2010, and Green, 2010). The idea\nis also defended by some philosophers writing in the phenomenological\ntradition\n (\u00a71.4.2).\n Many philosophers working today bring together work in both\ntraditions in defense of this idea (e.g., Overgaard 2019, Krueger\n2014, and J. Smith 2010). Consideration of issues to do with the self\nin relation to others has been thought by some to have the power to\nbridge the chasm between these two traditions in philosophy.\n1.4.1 McDowell and Dretske on perceptual knowledge of other minds\n\nThose attracted by the idea that our knowledge of other minds comes\nabout through perception often appeal to the following in defense of\ntheir position: we all acknowledge that we often claim to be in the\nposition where we can just see that another is angry, in\npain, and the like. These philosophers are careful to point out that\nwe don\u2019t always claim that this is the case and we do not claim\nit with respect to all mental states, but they hold that attention to\nsuch cases can teach us that the mental is not always \u201cwithdrawn\nfrom direct engagement with the world\u201d (McDowell 1995: 413).\nDuddington writes that to say that knowledge of another\u2019s mind\ncan be direct and immediate is to say that there is no veil or barrier\nintervening between the knowing subject and what is known\u2014it is\nnot to say either that our knowledge here is complete or that there\nare no difficulties that stand in the way of our attainment of such\nknowledge (1919: 167; cf. McDowell 1982).\n\nMcDowell has written that\n\n\nwe should not jib at, or interpret away, the common-sense thought that\n\u2026 one can literally perceive, in another person\u2019s facial\nexpression or his behavior, that he is in pain, and not just infer\nthat he is in pain from what one perceives. (1978: 305)\n\n\nMcDowell\u2019s perceptual account involves two crucial moves, one\nconcerning our understanding of experience and the other concerning\nour understanding of behavior. He proposes that we think of our\nexperience as being \u201copen\u201d to the world, allowing objects\nto figure in it directly; and in a parallel fashion he proposes that\nwe think of behavior as giving expression to mental states thereby\nallowing them to figure in behavior (McDowell 1982, 1986). According\nto McDowell, when one has an experience of genuinely expressive\nbehavior, one is not actually experiencing the mental state of the\nother; nonetheless, behavior in the veridical case should not be\nthought to fall short of mind in such a way as to allow for the\npossibility of its total absence. McDowell believes that this\nunderstanding of experience and behavior can support (sceptic-proof)\nknowledge of both the world and other minds.\n\nThe challenge for McDowell is to explain how error can arise in both\ncases. To accommodate error, McDowell introduces a disjunctive\nunderstanding of both experience and behavior (McDowell 1982; Soteriou\n2016). Considering the former we can say: either our\nexperience is such as to yield access to the world or it is\nsuch as to yield only apparent access. Considering the latter we can\nsay: either the observed behavior is such as to be expressive\nof the other\u2019s mentality or it only appears to be such.\nIn both cases the way things seem to the experiencing subject is such\nas to fall short of infallible knowledge as to which disjunct is in\nquestion (McDowell 1986 [1998: 240]). We may be fallible with respect\nto how things are in the world, but McDowell insists that we must be\ncareful to locate this fallibility in the right place. We should not\nconclude, as so many have, that all experience may be fallible; this\nis the move that paves the way for radical scepticism. It is, rather,\nour perceptual capacities that are fallible: sometimes they provide us\nwith experience which is veridical and sometimes they do not (McDowell\n2006). The important thing is that, when experience is veridical, we\ncan take it to give us (sceptic-proof) knowledge of the world.\n\nWhen it comes to our knowledge of other minds, the disjunctive move\nallows us to hold that, where behavior is genuinely expressive of\nanother\u2019s mental life, there our experience of her behavior will\nyield (sceptic-proof) knowledge of another\u2019s mental life.\nGenuinely expressive behavior is being thought of not as evidence (a\nsymptom) of another\u2019s mental life but as a criterion of it.\nThis, McDowellian, understanding of criteria\u2014in contrast to\nWright\u2019s\n (\u00a71.3)\u2014requires\n that we accept behavior in at least some cases to be expressive of, a\ncriterion of, mental states. So understood, behavioral criteria are\nindefeasible. This is not to say that error is not possible,\nas the person I encounter may be deceiving me. However, in such cases\nthe criterion for the mental state is not satisfied. The important\nthing is that this possibility should not be taken to negate the fact\nthat, when the other person is not deceiving me, my experience of her\nbehavior can result in (sceptic-proof) knowledge that she is, for\nexample, in pain. The genuine possibility that others may deceive me\nshould not be taken to open up the possibility that all others may be\nzombies and that I am in the world\n alone.[6]\n (We may here consider something Wittgenstein writes (1992, 94e):\n\u201cBut of course it isn\u2019t true that we are never certain\nabout the mental processes in someone else. In countless cases we\nare.\u201d)\n\nDretske\u2019s defense of our direct, perceptual knowledge of another\nmind differs significantly from the one that is found in the work of\nMcDowell or Duddington. Dretske is not interested in scepticism, or in\ngiving an account of knowledge that is sceptic-proof. He is interested\nonly in saying how it is that we come to know what others think and\nfeel, to identify the source of our knowledge here (cf.\n \u00a71).\n While we often say that we just can see what another is thinking or\nfeeling, it is also thought that there is an obstacle to taking\nperception to be a possible source of this knowledge. Dretske\nidentifies the obstacle here to arise from the fact that it is\ngenerally thought that another\u2019s mind is unobservable: while one\ncan see the smile, the clenched fist or the hunched shoulder, one\ncannot see what lies behind these things (Dretske 1973: 36). While\nDretske agrees that you cannot see another\u2019s joy, anger or\ndepression, he believes you can see (the fact) that another is happy,\nangry or depressed. The distinction here goes along with another that\nDretske draws between what he calls \u201cnon-epistemic\u201d and\n\u201cepistemic seeing\u201d. The former is a relation between a\nperson and a thing (Dretske likens this relation to stepping on a\nbug), while the latter has \u201cpositive belief content\u201d\n(Dretske 1966). He points out that just as one can see that someone is\nwealthy without seeing their wealth, or see that the metal rod is hot\nwithout seeing the heat, so one can see that another is happy, angry,\ndepressed and the like without seeing the other\u2019s joy, anger or\ndepression (Dretske 1966 and 1973). Dretske suggests an analysis of\nepistemic seeing, which analysis contains an all-important reliability\ncondition: the conditions under which, for example, Sally sees that\nTom is angry must be such that Tom would not look angry to Sally\nunless he was angry. It is the satisfaction of this reliability\ncondition that allows the satisfaction of the analysis to amount to\nboth a visual and an epistemic\n achievement.[7]\n\nDretske appreciates that a given behavior on Tom\u2019s part is not\nalways a reliable indicator of, say, anger. What he holds is that\nunder certain conditions and to those who know Tom well\u2014such as\nhis wife\u2014his behavior can be taken to be a reliable indicator of\nhis anger (for a critique of this idea see Avramides 2019). Therefore,\naccording to Dretske, we can have direct perceptual knowledge of\nanother\u2019s mental states in the following sense: we can see what\nothers are feeling andand thinking, even though we cannot see\nanother\u2019s mental states or know that solipsism is\n false.[8]\n\nQuassim Cassam brings the work of Dretske together with that of\nMcDowell in his defense of a perceptual account of our knowledge of\nother minds (Cassam 2007, ch. 5). Cassam uses Dretske\u2019s work to\nshow that one can know what another thinks and feels despite the fact\nthat one cannot see another\u2019s mental states. But rather than\nfollow Dretske in holding that behaviour is a reliable indicator of\nanother\u2019s mental states, Cassam follows McDowell and holds that\nbehaviour manifests another\u2019s mental states. Behaviour,\naccording to Cassam, is revealing of another\u2019s state of mind\nwithout being that state of mind (Cassam 2007, 165). The result of\nbringing the work of these two philosophers together allows Cassam to\nclaim that I can know both what another thinks and feels\nand that he is a thinking, feeling being. Dretske, on the\nother hand, holds that I can only know what another thinks and feels.\nAccording to Dretske, that another is a genuine thinking, feeling\nbeing is not something that can be known; rather, this is a\npresumption or presupposition (for a discussion of Cassam\u2019s work\nin relation to McDowell and Dretske see Avramides 2023). \n1.4.2 Perceptual knowledge of other minds and the phenomenological tradition\n\nThe late 19th and early twentieth centuries saw the\nemergence of the phenomenological movement associated with such\nfigures as Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty and Sartre. One important\ndimension of the work of these philosophers is discussion of\nintersubjectivity. There are two other philosophers in this tradition\nwhose work is also strongly associated with intersubjectivity, Max\nScheler and Edith Stein. It can be said of the phenomenological\napproach as a whole that it rejects the isolationism of the self that\ncharacterizes Cartesian philosophy. Scheler specifically criticizes\nthe argument from analogy, claiming (i) that it is mistaken in its\nstarting point or first premise and (ii) that it wrongly assumes that\nwe cannot have access to another\u2019s mind.\n\nThe first premise of the argument from analogy is, in effect, the\nCartesian starting point: one is secure in the knowledge that one has\nof one\u2019s own conscious experience. These phenomenologists reject\nthis starting point. In its place Husserl (1931) adopts the starting\npoint of embodied subjectivity, Heidegger (1927) insists that the\nstructure of human experience is such as to involve a relation to the\nworld and to others (Dasein is essentially characterized by\nMitsein), and Merleau-Ponty holds that \u201cI find myself\nalready situated and involved in a physical and social world\u201d\n(1945 [2003: 419]). Sartre takes things further and draws attention to\nthe extent to which the encounter with another is an encounter with\nsomeone who takes me as an object (1943).\n\nThese philosophers refuse to allow themselves to be pre-occupied by\nthe epistemological issues that they see as arising from a mistaken\nstarting point. Instead of asking how I can justify my belief in the\nworld and others, they take for granted that the individual\u2019s\nexperience is such as to exist in a world and for others and address\nquestions that concern this starting point, such as: what makes this\nstarting point possible (Husserl & Merleau-Ponty); how can we\nexplain/understand the structures of the being of subjectivity in such\na way as to include the world and others (Heidegger); how do I\nencounter the Other (Sartre). Crucial to the defense of this\nnon-Cartesian starting point is a non-Cartesian conception of mind in\nrelation to body. The conceptual divide between mind and body that one\nfinds in Descartes\u2019 philosophy is taken by these thinkers to be\n\u201cinadequate to phenomenology\u201d (Overgaard 2006).\n\nThese phenomenologists also reject the idea that we cannot have access\nto the mind of another. Scheler points out that\n\n\nwe believe ourselves to be directly acquainted with another\nperson\u2019s joy in his laughter, with his sorrow and pain in his\ntears, with his shame in his blushing\n\n\nand the like (1913 [1954: 260]). And in the same paragraph Scheler\ninsists that we should not allow philosophical theory to tempt us away\nfrom the obvious: that we know the minds of others through perception.\nIn a similarly vein, Merleau-Ponty (1945 [2003: 415]) writes:\n\n\nI perceive the grief or the anger of the other in his conduct, in his\nface or his hands, without recourse to any \u2018inner\u2019\nexperience of suffering or anger\u2026.\n\n\nScheler suggests that philosophical theory tries to turn us away from\nthe obvious by insisting that \u201cthere is certainly no sensation\nof another person\u2019s mind nor any stimulus from such a\nsource\u201d, and he insists that to think like this is to turn\none\u2019s back on the \u201cexpressive unity\u201d of behavior\n(1913 [1954: 181]). He writes: \u201cWe can \u2026 have insight\ninto others, in so far as we treat their bodies as a field of\nexpression for their experiences\u201d (1913 [1954: 10]). Whether we\ntake knowledge here to come about either as the reult of an inference\n(as in the argument from analogy) or though perception turns,\naccording to Scheler, on the question of how one views the\nrelationship between mind and behavior.\n\nScheler considers a crying child and the various responses that one\nmay have to her. Firstly there is the possibility that one sees the\nface but does not see it as expressing distress. Secondly there is the\npossibility that one sees the face as expressive of distress while\nremaining indifferent. And finally, there is the situation where one\nsees the child\u2019s distress and responds emotionally. Scheler\nassociates empathy with the second situation, and labels the emotional\nresponse in the final situation\n \u201csympathy.\u201d[9]\n The relationship between perception and empathy is explored in\nsomewhat more detail in the work of both Husserl and his student Edith\nStein. While Husserl struggles with the idea of empathy in relation to\nothers throughout his career we find in Stein\u2019s work a more\nsettled view (Zahavi 2014). Stein distinguishes empathy from\nperception, holding that empathy \u201cis a kind of act of perceiving\nsui generis\u201d (Stein 1917 [1989: 5]): it is like\nperception in so far as it is direct (like Scheler, Stein\nrejects the idea that knowledge of others comes about through\ninference); it is unlike perception in the way in which it gives us\nits object. Empathy is the way in which we experience foreign\nconsciousness. Stein follows Scheler in holding that our experience of\nthe other is an experience of a soul which is \u201calways\nnecessarily a soul in a body\u201d (1917 [1989: 44]), but she\nemphasizes the way in which this experience is always imperfect: there\nis always a distance between what I am aware of when I empathize with\nthe other and what the other is experiencing; I experience the other\nas other, as a center of intentionality or as a perspective\non the world that is different from mine (cf. Zahavi 2014: 192).\nWithout the distance introduced by an imperfect understanding\u2014if\nunderstanding here could be perfect\u2014I would be the other (cf.\nLevinas 1979: 89: \u201cthe absence of the other is exactly his\npresence as other\u201d). It is this distance that Stein accuses\nScheler of failing to capture in his more straightforwardly perceptual\n account.[10]\n As well as appreciating the otherness of the other, there is an\nappreciation in the work of Stein and Scheler of the ethical nature of\nmy encounter with the other (cf. Levinas, Wittgenstein and\nCavell).\n1.4.3 Indirect vs direct accounts\n\nIt is sometimes taken to be the case that perception and inference\nexhaust the alternatives when we consider how we might account for our\nknowledge of others. But, as we have seen in\n \u00a71.4.2,\n Stein\u2019s account eschews a straightforwardly perceptual account\nof our knowledge here without yet succumbing to an inferential one. It\nmay be more fruitful if one thought of the opposition here to be\nbetween indirect and direct accounts of our knowledge of others. What\nmany who oppose inference are against is the mind-body relationship\nupon which it is based. Many who reject indirect accounts are opposed\nto an idea that they see as lying at the heart of such accounts\n\u2013 the idea that the behaviour of the other acts as a veil\ncutting me off from the other\u2019s mental states. Once this idea is\nrejected, it remains open how to understand direct accounts. McDowell\nsuggests two possible interpretations. On the first, the fact of the\nother\u2019s mental states is presented to view; on the other,\n\n\n\u2026 we might think of what is directly available to experience in\nsome such terms as \u201chis giving expression to his being in the\n\u2018inner\u2019 state\u201d: this is something that, while not\nitself actually being the \u201cinner\u201d state of affairs in\nquestion, nevertheless does not fall short of it\u2026. (McDowell\n1982, 472\u20133). \n\n\nThose that advocate a direct account of our knowledge of other minds\nare faced with the following question: does their account entail a\nrejection of the asymmetry that philosophers have identified between\nknowledge of one\u2019s own and another\u2019s mind (see\n \u00a71)?\n Some philosophers who propose a direct account would insist that they\ncan still allow for an asymmetry here, just so long as we are careful\nhow we understand\n it.[11]\n They believe that we must be careful not to understand the asymmetry\nhere as committing us to a picture of mind as lying behind behavior.\nOne alternative to this picture can be found in the work of\nMerleau-Ponty who writes,\n\n\nThe grief and anger of another have never quite the same significance\nfor him as they have for me. For him these situations are lived\nthrough, for me they are displayed. (Merleau-Ponty 1945 [2003:\n415])\n\n\n(Cf. Wittgenstein 1992: 10e, who writes: \u201cMy words and my\nactions interest me in a completely different way than they do someone\nelse \u2026 I do not relate to them as an observer\u201d.)\n2. The Conceptual Problem of Other Minds\n\nThomas Nagel once wrote:\n\n\nThe interesting problem of other minds is not the epistemological\nproblem\u2026. It is the conceptual problem, how I can\nunderstand the attribution of mental states to others. (1986:\n19\u201320)\n\n\nBilgrami agrees (1992). Some philosophers go further than Nagel and\ninsist that the conceptual is the fundamental problem; others see\nlittle in it (Hyslop 1995). How one understands this problem is a\nmatter of some contention (Gomes 2011). What all agree is that the\nproblem is associated with the work of Wittgenstein, and in particular\nsection 302 from the Philosophical Investigations:\n\n\nIf one has to imagine someone else\u2019s pain on the model of\none\u2019s own, this is none too easy a thing to do: for I have to\nimagine pain which I do not feel on the model of pain which I\ndo feel. That is, what I have to do is not simply to make a\ntransition in imagination from one place of pain to another. As, from\nthe pain in the hand to pain in the arm. For I am not to imagine that\nI feel pain in some region of his body\u2026.\n\n\nMalcolm understands 302 as providing an \u201cexternal attack\u201d\non the possibility of a private language (contrast the argument of\n \u00a71.1).\n That is to say, 302 is designed to show the difficulty that one runs\ninto if one begins with the idea that one knows from one\u2019s own\ncase what it is to feel pain: one risks conceptual solipsism.\n [12]\n Colin McGinn has suggested that the problem raised in 302 can be\nthought of in the following way: if I learn through introspection what\nit is, say, to be in pain, then there is a \u201ca way of thinking\nabout my experiences which (a) only I have and (b) enters into my\nunderstanding of the concept in question\u201d (1984: 127). The way I\nlearn about the object of my thought here is as something that has a\n\u201cdistinctively first-person element\u201d from which it seems\nimpossible to prescind (ibid). This explains why I can make a\ntransition from the pain in my hand to the pain in my arm, but it is\n\u201cnone too easy a thing\u201d to make a transition from a pain\nthat I feel in my hand to a pain that you feel somewhere in your body\n(for a very different interpretation of the 302, see Kripke 1982,\nPostscript).\n\nSome associate the conceptual problem here with the problem of coming\nto have mental concepts that are completely general. Gareth Evans has\nproposed that to have a thought about an object to the effect that it\nis F (consider: Tom is angry) requires the exercise of the\nfollowing two capacities:\n\n\nOne being the capacity to think of x, which could be equally\nexercised in thoughts about x to the effect that it is\nG or H; and the other being a conception of what it\nis to be F, which could be equally exercised in thoughts\nabout other individuals, to the effect that they are F.\n(1982: 75)\n\n\nEvans labels this the \u201cgenerality constraint\u201d\n(Ibid, ftnt. 15), and it has been thought to raise a problem\nfor thoughts about mental states if one takes it that one comes to\nknow what a mental state is by inward reflection alone. The problem,\nreflected in 302, is how to understand the extension to others of a\nconcept acquired in this way.\n\nP.F. Strawson in effect acknowledges the generality constraint when he\nwrites:\n\n\nIt is a necessary condition of one\u2019s ascribing states of\nconsciousness, experiences, to oneself, in the way that one does, that\none should also ascribe them, or be prepared to ascribe them, to\nothers who are not oneself. (1959: 99)\n\n\nStrawson considers how it is that one ascribes mental states to others\nand concludes that one cannot do this if we insist on divorcing mental\nstates from the behaving body. Strawson claims that we must\nacknowledge what he calls the \u201cprimitiveness of the concept of a\nperson\u201d, the concept of\n\n\na type of entity such that both predicates ascribing states\nof consciousness and predicates ascribing corporeal\ncharacteristics \u2026 are equally applicable\u2026. (1959:\n101\u20132)\n\n\nWhile many will accept that the conceptual problem is the\nfirst problem we encounter in connection with others, others\ngo further and claim that once one addresses the conceptual problem\nthere is no room for the epistemological one. This is because our way\nof thinking and talking about mind will have application to others\nbuilt into it from the start. It has been pointed out that to say what\nis required for grasp of a concept is not yet to show that that\nconcept is\n instantiated.[13]\n It can be said in reply that it is a particular proposed solution to\nthis conceptual problem that may be thought to make the\nepistemological question otiose. As we can see with Strawson\u2019s\nproposal, the idea is that we break down the gap between mind and\nbehavior and understand what one experiences when one sees\nanother\u2019s behavior as itself requiring mental state attributions\nto the other. Some can only see in this proposal a retreat into\nbehaviorism. Others, however, insist that this is not the\ncase\u2014at least if behaviorism is understood as a reductionist\nthesis. It is not reductionist to hold that behavior is expressive of\nanother\u2019s mental life; genuinely expressive behavior is held to\nbe distinguishable from \u2018mere behavior\u2019 (cf. Austin\n1946).\n\nMcDowell claims to echo Strawson\u2019s work when he writes in this\nconnection that we must regain the concept of a human being\nfrom what he takes to be a \u201cphilosophically generated\u201d\nconcept of a human body (McDowell 1982: 469; cf. Cook 1969).\nSome take issue with McDowell over whether the latter is only a\nphilosophically generated concept (Wright 1998), but it is hard to\ndeny that the move from the former concept to the latter is deeply\nsignificant.\n3. The Naturalist Turn\n\nAlvin Goldman (2006) has distinguished a descriptive from a normative\nepistemological problem of other minds.\n Section 1\n and\n section 2\n were largely concerned with the latter; this section will concern\nitself with the former. The descriptive problem is associated with\nwhat Goldman terms mind reading (or mentalizing).\nMind reading involves the capacity to think about mind and is a second\nor higher order activity that involves representing or conceptualizing\nothers (as well as oneself) as \u201cloci of mental\nlife\u201d (Goldman 2006: 3). While many species of animal may be\nthought to have minds, only some will be capable of representing\nanother as having minds. Questions of justification and conceptual\ndifficulty are not of concern to the descriptive theorist, nor are\nmetaphysical questions concerning the nature of mind; what concerns\nthe descriptive epistemologist is how what she says measures up with\nwhat is being learned in the empirical disciplines of developmental\npsychology and neuroscience. Work on the descriptive problem is\ndeveloping at a rapid pace and, while at first attention in all the\nrelevant disciplines was concentrated on two prominent accounts of\nmind reading\u2014theory-theory and simulation theory\u2014a variety\nof accounts now exist which challenge both of these accounts (see\n \u00a73.2).\n3.1 Theory-Theory and Simulation Theory\n\nTheory-theory has its roots in a paper by Premack and Woodruff (1978),\nwhich argued that certain problem-solving behavior observed in\nchimpanzees should be taken as evidence that they possess a theory of\nmind, as evidence that they are able to make predictions about the\nbehavior of others that impute to them unobservable mental states.\nPremack and Woodruff take this imputation to be a rather primitive and\nunsophisticated reaction to the observation of certain behavior, so\nnatural in both humans and chimpanzees that it would take an effort to\nsuppress\n it.[14]\n\nIn their commentaries on this paper (1978), Dennett, Bennett, and\nHarman pointed out that further experimentation was required in order\nto determine whether a creature possesses the concept of belief (which\nconcept is required in order to have thoughts about another\u2019s\nmental states). In particular, it would need to be shown that the\ncreature possesses the concept of false belief. Wimmer and\nPerner (1983) devised a test that purported to show just that. The\noriginal test was carried out with normally developing human children\nand taken to show that the capacity to represent false beliefs is\npresent in 4 to 6 year olds, but absent in 3 year\n olds.[15]\n Two different proposals have been put forward to explain this\ndevelopmental change. One proposal (see, e.g., Gopnik & Wellman\n1992) suggests that the child possesses a na\u00efve psychological\ntheory that it uses to explain and predict the behavior of others and\nthat gets revised by the child over time. The other proposal (see,\ne.g., Leslie & Roth 1993) suggests a native, domain-specific (or\nmodular) mechanism that matures at a certain point as what explains\nthe child\u2019s success with the false-belief test.\n\nThis approach to understanding how we attribute mental states to\nothers has several notable features: (i) it dovetails with the\ndominant approach to solving the knowledge-of-other-minds problem as\nit proposes that our belief here is the result of postulating mental\nstates as the best explanation of observed behavior; (ii) it dovetails\nwith a functionalist account of mind; and (iii) it can solve the\nasymmetry problem, as some hold the child comes to attribute mental\nstates to herself on the same model as she does others (Gopnik 2009).\nAll three features of this theory have come under criticism. This\napproach has also been challenged by further empirical work that\npurports to show that infants as young as 15 months have the concept\nof false belief (Onishi & Baillargeon 2005). One suggestion to\naccommodate this data is that we postulate two systems: one that\noperates in the infant and that is fast, efficient, inflexible and\nnon-normative, and another that develops later (and operates in tandem\nwith the earlier one in the mature human) and that is effortful,\ninflexible, normative and language-dependent (Apperly and Butterfill\n2009; for a good summary of this work and a critique of it, see Jacob\n2019). Much recent work has challenged the conclusion that the child\nwho fails the false belief test lacks a competence, suggesting instead\nthat the young child\u2019s failure with the false belief test should\nbe accounted for in terms of performance factors (in this connection\nsee work by Fabricius and Oktay-G\u00fcr & Rakoczy). Questions\nhave been raised about various aspects of the design of the original\nfalse belief test, including questions regarding the way national or\ncommunity identity may be thought to play a role in the performance\nand understanding of the tasks.\n\nRobert Gordon, Jane Heal and Alvin Goldman propose an alternative to\nthe theory-theory account of how to understand the attribution of\nmental states to others. Heal identifies in theory-theory a scientific\nmotivation that runs roughshod over important differences between\nhuman beings and the rest of the natural world. While theory-theorists\nextend a style of understanding from its application in connection\nwith the latter to the former, Heal and others propose that we come to\nunderstand what the other persons are thinking \u201cfrom the\ninside\u201d, that we \u201cexploit the fact that we are or have\nminds\u201d (Heal 1998 [2003: 84]). Heal is particularly concerned\nwith the question, What further thoughts will a person have given what\nthoughts I already know her to have? (Heal (1998) also traces out\nfurther questions about others that may concern us.) Gordon (1986,\n1995) insists that simulation theory must be formulated in such a way\nas to avoid reliance on both introspection and inference from oneself\nto the other. Rather than imagine what I would do in your situation,\nhe suggests that I imagine being you in your situation. In this way,\nthinking about others is taken to parallel understanding of\none\u2019s own future behavior: one predicts what one will do by\nimagining or pretending that the world is a certain way. Simulation\ntheory has its roots in Verstehen theories favored by\nsociologists and historians such as Collingwood and Dilthey (as well\nas work by Lipps on empathy; for an overview here see Stueber 2018).\nSimulation theory was thought to be given neurophysiological backing\nby the discovery of mirror neurons in the pre-motor cortex and in\nBroca\u2019s area of the human brain that are activated both when an\nindividual acts and when she observes the actions of another (Gallese\nand Goldman 1998; Gallese 2001; Rizzolatti et al. 1996). (For an\noverview of the different versions of simulation theory that have been\nadvocated see Barlassina and Gordon 2017.)\n3.2 The Second Person and Person Model Theory\n\nOver the years theory-theory and simulation theory have moved closer\ntowards each other, giving rise to various hybrid accounts of how it\nis that we attribute minds to others. But there are those who\nchallenge both theories and any hybrid versions that they have\nspawned. One such challenge arises from Gallagher & Zahavi 2008\nwho urge that we cast aside both third-person (theory) and\nfirst-person (simulation) approaches, and concentrate instead on\nsecond-person interaction. (In its development in Gallagher\u2019s\nwork, this approach has come to be known as \u201cinteraction\ntheory\u201d.) Influenced by work in phenomenology and embodied\ncognition, Gallagher and Zahavi propose that our attribution of mental\nstates to others is the result of perception of and reaction to\nbehavior understood as expressive of mental life. Furthermore, they\nsuggest that the activation of mirror neurons be understood as serving\naction or response preparation (rather than as supporting simulation,\ncf.\n \u00a73.1).\n Drawing on the work of developmental psychologists such as Meltzoff,\nTrevarthen, and Hobson, they identify two forms of intersubjectivity:\na primary form identifiable in early infancy that involves a\ndifferential response to persons and inanimate objects; and a\nsecondary form when the behavior of persons is interpreted \u201cin\nterms of their goals and intentions set in contextualized\nsituations\u201d (Gallagher & Zahavi 2008: 190). In addition to\nprimary and secondary intersubjectivity, and at the point when the\nchild has language, it is suggested that a more nuanced way of\nunderstanding others becomes possible through the development of\ncommunicative and narrative practices (Hutto 2008; Gallagher &\nHutto 2008). Gallagher and Zahavi reject inferential accounts of how\nwe know others in favor of a direct perceptual one, and they\nunderstand behavior (e.g., gesture, facial expressions, contextualized\nactions) to be constitutive of mental life. Importantly, they point\nout that one shouldn\u2019t conceive of interpersonal understanding\nas if it was merely and primarily a question of bridging the gap\nbetween two isolated subjects. Interpersonal understanding occurs in a\ncontext and through \u201cour shared engagement in the common\nworld\u201d (Gallagher & Zahavi 2008: 190; cf. Gurwitsch 1977\n[1979]).\n\nThis work aims to move us away from an overly-intellectualized way of\nthinking of other minds and to turn our attention to the world that we\nlive and act in with others. The emphasis here is less on individual\nbeliefs and desires than in shared intentions and goals. As Gallagher\nsays in one place, \u201csocial cognition is often nothing more than\n\u2026 social interaction\u201d (2008: 541).\n\nInteraction theory can be seen as an extension of enactivist theories\nof perception that understand perception as a highly complex\naction-oriented phenomenon, incorporating both meaning and emotion: to\nsee an object is to see it as affording me opportunity for action, and\nthis opportunity is taken to be part of how I make sense of the world\nand what gives the world value for me (cf. Clarke, Noe, Varela et\nal). The extension of this idea allows that social interactions\nalso constitute for me \u201cnovel domains of possibilities for sense\nmaking\u201d (De Jaegher 2009). To see the other person is to see her\nas affording interaction; in this regard, direct perception is direct\nenactive perception. Interactionist theorists have suggested concrete\nproposals for empirical work in psychology and neuroscience in the\nhopes of moving this research away from what they see as individualism\nand methodological solipsism (De Jaegher, DiPaulo, & Gallagher\n2010). Rather than taking individual agents to be constitutive of\nsocial interaction, these interaction theorists take them to be\nconstituted by their interaction with others.\n\nPerson model theory challenges theory-theory (TT) and simulation\ntheory (ST)\u2014as well as interaction theory (IT; Newen 2015, Newen\n& Schlicht 2009). Person model theory finds certain limitations in\neach of the theories that it opposes. In the place of the two forms of\nintersubjectivity recommended by Gallagher and Zahavi, person theory\nsuggests that the infant works with a \u201cnon-conceptual\nperson-schema\u201d which develops\u2014through the combined work of\nobservation and narrative\u2014into \u201cconceptualized\nperson-images\u201d. Thus, it is proposed that the understanding of\npersons is a step-by-step process of enrichment, central to which is\nthe acceptance of a multiplicity of strategies (TT, ST, and IT among\nthem). Which strategy is deployed is dependent upon such things as\ncontext, how similar or different the other is from oneself, whether\nthe understanding is of an emotion or a propositional attitude, and\nthe complexity of the mental state. The idea of the deployment of a\nmultiplicity of strategies is not unique to Person Theory. Gallagher\nand Fiebich (2019) argue for what they call a \u201cpluralist\napproach\u201d to the understanding of others, drawing on inference,\nsimulation, direct perception, and/or interaction\u2014depending on\nthe situation (cf. Nichols & Stich 2003). What this work\nhighlights is how much may be involved when it comes to understanding\nothers.\n\nIt is possible to see a connection between ideas that are fundamental\nto interaction theory (which brings together work from phenomenology\nand embodied cognition) and some ideas that can be found in the work\nof Stanley Cavell (which aims to interpret and develop the work of\nAustin and Wittgenstein, as well as integrating work from\nphenomenology with work in analytic philosophy). Where Gallagher and\nZahavi emphasize social interaction, Cavell writes of a duality in the\nproblem of other minds. Cavell understands this duality to be what the\nradical Cartesian sceptic overlooks when she presses her question\nabout our knowledge of the mind of another. What we must appreciate,\naccording to Cavell, is that in so far as there is a problem about how\nI know you, there is equally a problem about how you know me (herein\nlies the duality in the problem). Cavell holds that appreciating this\nduality will help us to see the error of the sceptic\u2019s ways. The\nsceptic considers only one side of the problem and insists that we\nsuffer from an epistemological lack. Cavell draws attention to the\nside of the problem that the sceptic misses and finds in this a fear\non our part of not being understood by another. It is this fear that\ngets misunderstood by the sceptic and turned into a darkness which is\nprojected on to the other. Cavell thinks we must resist this\nprojection and understand that acknowledgment by another is made\npossible by expression on my part. Expression is what makes\nacknowledgement possible. We must take responsibility to give\nexpression to our mental states which can in turn be acknowledged by\nothers. Importantly, for Cavell acknowledgement is not the same as\nknowledge. While the latter is a form of cognition, the forner is to\nbe understood as behaviour oriented towards another (for more on the\nduality that Cavell finds in the problem of other minds see Avramides,\nforthcoming). According to Cavell, I must take responsibility for\nacknowledging the humanity in others, which acknowledgement is evident\nin the way I behave towards them.\n4. Thinking about Mind Prior to the Twentieth Century\n4.1 From Descartes to Mill\n\nAs so much of the debate concerning others in the heyday of its\ndiscussion in analytic philosophy in the twentieth century can be read\nas a reaction to Mill\u2019s formulation of the argument from\nanalogy, it is instructive to consider the context for Mill\u2019s\nwork\n here.[16]\n In proposing his argument, Mill was responding to a challenge laid\ndown by the eighteenth century philosopher Thomas Reid who argued that\nDescartes\u2019 philosophy, when traced through the work of\nphilosophers such as Malebranche, Locke, Hume and Berkeley, leads to\nsolipsism. In order to avoid this conclusion, Reid argued that\nphilosophers must jettison the Cartesian framework of ideas and its\ntrust in reason over the deliverances of sense. According to Reid, the\nfaculties of reason and perception should be regarded as being on an\nequal footing. Rather than insist that all human belief is regulated\nby reason, Reid holds that we should allow that our perceptions of the\nworld are guided by principles for which no proof can be offered.\nAmongst the regulative principles Reid identifies there are two\nconcerning others: (i) there is life and intelligence in our fellow\nmen; and (ii) certain features of the countenance, sounds of the voice\nand gestures of the body indicate certain thoughts and dispositions of\nmind (Reid 1785). Mill\u2019s work is designed as a defense of the\nCartesian framework in response to Reid\u2019s claim that it leads\ninexorably to solipsism. According to Mill, all truths are known in\none of two ways: either directly, through the authority of\nconsciousness, or indirectly, by inference from truths known directly.\nMill believes that knowledge arrived indirectly in this way is\nsufficient to avoid the concern of solipsism.\n\nWhile there is little direct discussion of this question in\nDescartes\u2019 work, one can find passages devoted to it in\npost-Cartesian\n philosophy.[17]\n Malebranche, for example, differentiates knowledge of one\u2019s own\nmind, of bodies, and of other men\u2019s mind: the first is through\nconsciousness, the second through ideas, and the third through\nconjecture (1674\u20135 [1980: 239]). In the case of another\nman\u2019s sensations, Malebranche first considers the possibility\nthat everyone has the same sensations when confronted with the same\nobjects, but then notes that it can happen that \u201cthe internal\nfibers of the optic nerve do not produce the same sensation for\ndifferent people\u201d (Ibid, 66). Despite this possibility,\nMalebranche thinks there is reason to believe that God arranged things\nso that the same physical conditions do produce the same sensations\n(i.e., that nature is uniform). Nonetheless, he argues that we cannot\nknow another\u2019s sensations as there is \u201ca great deal of\ndiversity in different people\u2019s organs of sight as well as of\nhearing and taste\u201d\n (ibid).[18]\n Writing in response to Malebranche, Arnauld (1683) insists that we do\nknow other men\u2019s minds through ideas: we have ideas of their\nbodies and must reason from these to the conclusion that they have\nminds. In Arnauld\u2019s work we have, arguably, an early formulation\nof the argument from analogy.\n\nIt may be worth remembering that, in so far as Descartes\u2019\nphilosophy raises a problem about other minds, it is a thick or\nradical sceptical problem. What one finds in Malebranche\u2019s work\nis a thin sceptical problem. Malebranche appears to take it for\ngranted that others have minds; what interests him is whether the\nsensations that others feel are the same as those that I feel. John\nLocke follows Malebrance in not taking seriously the thick or radical\nsceptical problem here. Locke asks whether the idea produced in one\nman\u2019s mind by a violet may not be exactly the same as the idea\nproduced in another man\u2019s mind by a marigold (Locke 1689, II,\nxxxii, 15). But as Locke is concerned less with the\n\u201cmetaphysical Sense of the word Truth\u201d and more with\n\u201cthe more ordinary Acceptation of those words\u201d he allows\nthat \u201cthe sensible Ideas, produced by any Object in\ndifferent Men\u2019s Minds, are most commonly very near and\nundiscernible alike\u201d (Locke 1689, II, XXXii, 13 & 15). \n\nThe threat of solipsism is particularly problematic for the idealism\nof George Berkeley. Without proof of other minds, idealism will amount\nto nothing but solipsism. Berkeley admits that I cannot have immediate\nevidence of the mind of another; what he holds is that there is\n\u201ca certain collection of ideas, as directs us to think there is\na distinct principle of thought and motion like until ourselves,\naccompanying and represented by it\u201d (Berkeley 1710: Principle\n148). While some find in Berkeley\u2019s work another early\nformulation of the argument from analogy (Urmson 1982), others argue\nthat his work should be read as putting forwards a causal argument: in\nthe case of God, I reason that He is the cause or Author of everything\nin nature that I see around me; in the case of other finite spirits, I\nreason that they are the cause of the movements in the bodies I\nobserve and the words that I hear (Bennett 1971 and Falkenstein\n1990).\n\nSome philosophers also find an argument from analogy in the work of\nDavid Hume, while others interpret his work in a more naturalistic\nvein. One thing that cannot be denied is that Hume introduces an\nimportant element into the discussion of others when he writes in\nThe Treatise, \u201cNo quality of human nature is more\nremarkable, both in itself and in its consequences, than that\npropensity we have to sympathize with others\u201d (1738\u201340\n[1888: 316]). It is by means of sympathy that we are affected by the\npassions and mental states of others, which otherwise \u201cremain\nconcealed in the minds of others\u201d (ibid, 593).\nPrecisely how this remarkable capacity operates is a matter of some\ndebate. There are those who agree with Reid and find Hume unable to\nescape the confines of his own mind. These philosophers argue that\nHume recognizes the problem of other minds that arises for the\nCartesian framework that he endorses, and holds that sympathy can do\nno more than get us to feel our own feelings in response to what we\nobserve in the other. But there are others who take Hume to turn his\nback on scepticism and the very business of providing reasons for the\nbelief that others have thoughts and feelings. They read Hume\u2019s\nwork as giving us a psychological account of how it is that we are\nable to understand the thoughts and feelings of our fellow men through\nthe operation of sympathy (Greco 2012; see also work by Waldow\n2009).\n\nHume\u2019s understanding of the working of sympathy was challenged\nby his contemporary Adam Smith. Smith rejects the idea that I can feel\nwhat another feels. He writes,\n\n\nThough our brother is upon the rack, as long as we ourselves are at\nour ease, our senses will never inform us of what he suffers. They\nnever did, and never can, carry us beyond our own person, and it is by\nthe imagination only that we can form any conception of what are his\nsensations\u2026.\n\n\nA little later he writes,\n\n\nThat this is the source of our fellow-feeling for the misery of\nothers, that it is by changing places in fancy with the sufferer, that\nwe come either to conceive or to be affected by what he feels, may be\ndemonstrated by many obvious observations, if it should not be thought\nsufficiently evident of itself. (1759: I.i.i.2\u20133)\n\n\nWith Smith\u2019s work we take a step closer to the work of the\nsimulation theorists of more recent times (cf.\n \u00a73.1).\n\nIt is Reid\u2019s contention that, so long as one is working within a\nCartesian framework of ideas, our relations to others must be a taken\nto be a matter of probability, hypothesis, or conjecture, and this he\ntakes to be at odds with the conviction with which, for example, the\nchild interacts with her nurse. While the Cartesian recognizes only\nthe solitary operations of mind, Reid proposes that we also recognize\nthe social operations of mind (Reid 1785 [1969: 71]).\n4.2 Before Descartes\n\nPhilosophers are inclined to trace the problem of other minds back to\nthe writing of Descartes. If it is true that there is something in\nDescartes\u2019 philosophy that gives rise to this problem, then one\nmay expect to find the \u2018problem of other minds\u2019 less\npressing in the work of pre-Cartesian philosophy. With the possible\nexception of Augustine (whose work is taken by some to be a pre-cursor\nto Descartes\u2019), this is arguably the case.\n\nWhile philosophers in ancient Greece raise sceptical questions\nconcerning others, it is has been suggested that the problems they\nraise tend to be \u2018thin\u2019 rather than \u2018thick\u2019\nones (see\n \u00a71\n and Avramides 2001). Plato and Aristotle, for example, discuss the\nvalue of friendship, but do not ask why we should think others exist\nto be friends. Sorabji claims that \u201cit never occurs to Aristotle\nto raise doubts about other minds\u201d (1974: 88). According to\nSextus Empiricus, sceptics of the Cyrenaic school raise problems about\nthe minds of others, but it is not clear that the problem they raise\ngoes beyond the \u2018thin\u2019 one, How can I know what\nanother thinks and feels? (Tsouna\n 1998a).[19]\n4.3 Another History\n\nWhile philosophers in the West trace their lineage back to ancient\nGreece, it is worth remembering that philosophical ideas were also\nbeing discussed elsewhere in the world. One tradition that has a long\nhistory of concern with issues to do with the minds of others is the\nclassical Indian tradition. While one should not read texts from other\nphilosophical traditions only to find parallels with one\u2019s own,\nit is striking that these early Eastern philosophers may be thought to\nhave grappled with many of the same issues concerning others as have\nphilosophers in the Western tradition. It is possible to find\ndiscussion of both epistemological and conceptual problems in\nconnection with others in these texts. There are two important works\nin this tradition devoted to questions concerning others, one by\nDharmak\u012brti in the seventh century and another by Ratnakirti in\nthe 11th. Indeed, Sharma (1985) writes that\n\u201cDharmak\u012brti is perhaps the first ever thinker to make a\nsystematic attempt to come to grips with this problem [of other\nminds]\u201d. Dharmak\u012brti is an idealist who denies the reality\nof the external world and whose work, therefore, is open to the charge\nof solipsism. In his Proof of the Existence of Other Streams of\nConsciousness, Dharmak\u012brti first points out that the mind of\nanother is imperceptible; he then goes on to argue that other minds\nare inferred from observed speech and action. Many find in the writing\nof Dharmakirti an argument not dissimilar to the one found in the\nwriting of John Stuart Mill (see, for example, Chakrabarti 2020, Pt.\n3) Dharmak\u012brti is careful to acknowledge that there are limits to\nour understanding of others (we cannot know what it is like for them)\n(Inami 2001). Ganeri (2012) suggests that what we find in\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s text is \u201ca sort of argument from\nanalogy\u201d for the existence of others. Responding to\nDharmak\u012brti here, Ratnakirti points out the difficulties in\nreasoning to the mind of another that one can never be in a position\nto verify. In effect, Ratnakirti argues that other minds cannot be\ntaken to exist, and solipsism must be accepted. However, Ratnakirti is\ncareful to draw a distinction between conventional and ultimate\nexistence\u2014while other minds do not exist ultimately, they do\nexist conventionally. It is this conventional existence that explains\nour actions with regards to others. According to Ganeri, we can also\nfind in Ratnakirti\u2019s work arguments to show that it is not\npossible even to form a conception of another mind (2012: 203). This\nproblem is particularly pressing for the Buddhist philosopher for, as\nGaneri reminds us (2012: 202), without a conception of others it is a\nquestion how one can cultivate compassion.",
