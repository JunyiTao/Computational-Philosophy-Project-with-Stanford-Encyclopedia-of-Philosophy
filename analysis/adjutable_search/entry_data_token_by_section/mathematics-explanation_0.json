    "main_text": "Mathematical explanation in the empirical sciences\n1. Mathematical explanation in the empirical sciences\n\nNearly all of our most successful empirical sciences employ a great\ndeal of mathematics. In addition, scientists often emphasize the value\nof explaining some phenomenon that they have discovered. It is natural\nto wonder, then, if mathematics is well-suited to contribute to the\nexplanation of natural phenomena and what these contributions might\nbe. In the philosophy of science most accounts of explanation identify\nan explanation with an appropriate description of a cause (see Salmon\n1984, Cartwright 1989, Woodward 2003, Strevens 2008, and Beebee,\nHitchcock & Menzies 2010 for an overview). Nearly everyone can\nadmit that mathematical tools are an excellent means of tracking or\nrepresenting causes. For example, mathematics can be used to explain\nwhy Halley\u2019s comet\u2019s orbit has a period of 75 years. Much\nof the debate about mathematical explanation in the empirical sciences\nhas focused on more contentious cases: what role might mathematics\nplay in non-causal explanations, if there are any, and how might these\ncases challenge this or that account of causal explanation (Reutlinger\n& Saatsi 2018)?\n\nOne kind of case that has been emphasized aims to explain the\npossibility or impossibility of some process. For example, why can we\nnot divide our 23 strawberries equally among three friends (Lange\n2013), or why can we arrange 81 stamps into a 9 by 9 array? The\nlegitimate explanations seem to be that 23 is not divisible by 3\nwithout remainder and that \\(9 \\times 9 = 81.\\) Neither mathematical\nfact is a cause of the feature of the process in question, so we seem\nto have a non-causal explanation where mathematics is part of the\nexplanation. The possibility or impossibility of other processes are\nexplained by other areas of mathematics that investigate structures or\nformal features of natural systems. For example, why can we not make a\ncircuit of the bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg that involves crossing each\nof the bridges exactly once (Pincock 2007, Molinini 2012)? This is\nexplained by the abstract structure of the bridge network. Why is it\npossible for there to be stable planetary orbits? One explanation that\nhas been proposed appeals to the dimensions of space-time (Woodward\n2003).\n\nAnother kind of non-causal mathematical explanation deals with a\nstriking or surprising feature of a phenomenon, where that feature can\nbe identified through a mathematical analysis of the situation. The\nfeature may be tied to a minimization process, or be especially\nresilient or stable for what is arguably a mathematical reason.\nPerhaps the most discussed case is the length in years of the\nlife-cycle of three species of periodic cicada: why are these lengths\neither 13 or 17 years (Baker 2005, 2017)? An explanation is that 13\nand 17 are prime numbers and that prime numbered life-cycles confer a\nrelative fitness advantage in avoiding predators and competition for\nscarce resources like food. Other broadly evolutionary cases include\nthe hexagonal shape of honeycomb cells (Lyon & Colyvan 2008,\nR\u00e4z 2017, Wakil & Justus 2017) and the pattern of seeds in a\nsunflower (Lyon 2012). There is an extensive literature on how these\noptimality explanations might work in biology and economics (Potochnik\n2007, Rice 2015, 2021). However, this explanatory contribution from\nmathematics can be found in other domains as well. For example, why do\nsoap films obey Plateau\u2019s laws (Lyon 2012, Pincock 2015a)? This\ncan be explained through a process of surface minimization, subject to\nconstraints. The mathematics of the situation is central to the\ncharacter that the laws take on. Other cases turn on a mathematical\nanalysis of the stability or instability of some process. For example,\nwhy do the so-called Kirkwood gaps appear in our solar system\u2019s\nasteroid belt (Colyvan 2010)? Occupying some spatial regions is\nunstable, so that an asteroid that starts in such a region is\noverwhelmingly likely to leave it. Similar analyses explain patterns\nin the rings of Saturn or the collapse of an engineered structure like\na bridge. (See also Ashbaugh, Chicone & Cushman 1991, Colyvan\n2001, Lipton 2004, Baker 2015a and Lange 2017 for a range of other\nexamples.)\n\nThe rest of section 1 will consider some of the history of the debates\nabout non-causal mathematical explanations (section 1.1) and their\nsignificance for various theories of scientific explanation (1.2). The\nsection then turns to two other debates that are closely related to\nthese features of these explanations: how mathematical models may\nexplain despite their highly idealized character (1.3) and how the\nexplanatory role of mathematics in science could support a platonistic\ninterpretation of pure mathematics (1.4).\n",
