    "main_text": "The Problem of the Direction of Time I\n2. The Problem of the Direction of Time I\n\nThe first \u201cproblem of the direction of time\u201d is: what\naccounts for the time asymmetry of thermodynamics? Thermodynamics is\nnot a fundamental physical science. Hence it must inherit its massive\ntime asymmetry from the microworld. But where? In virtue of what,\nfundamentally, is thermodynamics time asymmetric? The puzzle is\nusually said to arise due to fundamental physics being time symmetric,\nor more precisely, time reversal invariant. (A theory is time reversal\ninvariant, loosely speaking, if its laws don\u2019t care about the\ndirection of time.) No asymmetry in, no asymmetry out; therefore there\nis a puzzle over where the asymmetry enters. However, even if\nfundamental physics is time asymmetric one can and should still demand\nan answer to the question of what accounts for thermodynamics time\nasymmetry. The answer could be non-trivial because the time asymmetry\nof fundamental physics may have nothing to do with the time asymmetry\nof thermodynamics. This situation actually appears to be the case, as\nweak interactions between quarks and leptons can violate time symmetry\nyet these violations don\u2019t appear to be responsible for\nthermodynamic behavior.\n\nHistorically the problem arose in a wonderful series of debates and\narguments between the great physicist Ludwig Boltzmann and some of his\ncontemporaries, notably, Johann Loschmidt, Ernst Zermelo and Edward\nCulverwell. Boltzmann was one of the founders and most influential\ndevelopers of the field of statistical mechanics, as well as (later in\nlife) a philosopher. While seeking a mechanical underpinning of the\nSecond Law, he discovered a particularly ingenious explanation for why\nsystems tend toward equilibrium.\n\nIgnoring historical details (Brush 1976, Frigg & Werndl 2011,\nSklar 1993, Uffink 2006), here is the core idea loosely reconstructed\nfrom Boltzmann\u2019s later writings. Consider an isolated gas of\n\\(N\\) particles in a box, where \\(N\\) is large enough to make the\nsystem macroscopic \\((N \\approx 10^{23}+)\\). For the sake of\nfamiliarity we will work with classical mechanics. We can characterize\nthe gas by the coordinates and momenta \\(x_{in}, p_{in}\\) of each of\nits particles and represent the whole system by a point \\(X = (q,p)\\)\nin a \\(6N\\)-dimensional phase space known as \\(\\Gamma\\), where \\(q =\n(q_1 \\ldots q_{3N})\\) and \\(p = (p_1 \\ldots p_{3N})\\).\nBoltzmann\u2019s great insight was to see that the thermodynamic\nentropy arguably \u201creduced\u201d to the volume in \\(\\Gamma\\)\npicked out by the macroscopic parameters of the system. The key\ningredient is partitioning \\(\\Gamma\\) into compartments, such that all\nof the microstates \\(X\\) in a compartment are macroscopically (and\nthus thermodynamically) indistinguishable. To each macrostate \\(M\\),\nthere corresponds a volume of \\(\\Gamma\\), \\(\\lvert\\Gamma_M\\rvert\\),\nwhose size will depend on the macrostate in question. For\ncombinatorial reasons, almost all of \\(\\Gamma\\) corresponds to a state\nof thermal equilibrium. There are simply many more ways to be\ndistributed with uniform temperature and pressure than ways to be\ndistributed with nonuniform temperature and pressure. There is a vast\nnumerical imbalance in \\(\\Gamma\\) between the states in thermal\nequilibrium and the states in thermal nonequilibrium.\n\nWe now introduce Boltzmann\u2019s famous formula (up to an additive\nconstant) for what we might call the \u201cBoltzmann entropy\u201d\n\\(S_B\\): \n\\[ S_B (M(X)) = k \\log \\lvert\\Gamma_M\\rvert \\]\n where \\(\\lvert\\Gamma_M\\rvert\\) is the volume in\n\\(\\Gamma\\) associated with the macrostate \\(M\\), \\(X\\) is the\nmicrostate of the system, and \\(k\\) is Boltzmann\u2019s constant.\n\\(S_B\\) provides a relative measure of the amount of \\(\\Gamma\\)\ncorresponding to each \\(M\\).\n\nGiven the mentioned asymmetry in \\(\\Gamma\\), almost all microstates\nrealizing non-equilibrium macrostates are such that their\nentropy value is overwhelmingly likely to increase with time. When the\nconstraints are released on systems initially confined to small\nsections of \\(\\Gamma\\), typical systems will evolve into\nlarger compartments. Since the new equilibrium distribution occupies\nalmost all of the newly available phase space, nearly all of\nthe microstates originating in the smaller volume will tend toward\nequilibrium. Except for those incredibly rare microstates conspiring\nto stay in small compartments, microstates will evolve in such a way\nas to have \\(S_B\\) increase. Substantial questions can be raised about\nthe details of this approach. What justifies, for instance, the\nstandard probability measure on \\(\\Gamma\\)? Nonetheless, the\nBoltzmannian explanation seems to offer a plausible and powerful\nframework for understanding why the entropy of systems tends\nto increase with time. (For further explanation and discussion see\nBricmont 1995; Frigg 2008, 2009; Goldstein 2001; Hemmo & Shenker\n2012; Klein 1973; Lavis 2005; Lebowitz 1993; Uffink 2006.)\n\nTrouble looms over this explanation of time asymmetry (see Brown,\nMyrvold, & Uffink 2009). Before Boltzmann explained entropy\nincrease as described above, he proposed a now notorious\n\u201cproof\u201d known as the \u201c\\(H\\)-theorem\u201d to the\neffect that entropy must always increase. Loschmidt 1876/1877 and\nZermelo 1896 launched objections to the \\(H\\)-theorem. If we take as\npremises classical mechanical dynamics, they pointed out, it\u2019s\nimpossible to get any function of the classical state to monotonically\nincrease. Loschmidt focused on the time reversal invariance of the\nclassical dynamics and Zermelo on its recurrence property (roughly,\nthat a bounded system, left to itself, will eventually return\narbitrarily close to its initial state, for any given initial state).\nThey were right: time reversal means that for every entropy-increasing\nsolution to the classical equations there is a mirror\nentropy-decreasing solution; and recurrence means that every solution\nwill at some point have its entropy decrease if we wait long enough.\nSome time asymmetric ingredient that had not been properly announced\nhad been smuggled into the theorem.\n\nThe reader can find this story in many textbooks and in many\nreferences cited above. An objection in their spirit (specifically,\nLoschmidt\u2019s) can also be advanced against Boltzmann\u2019s\nlater view sketched above. Loosely put, because the classical\nequations of motion are time reversal invariant, nothing in the\noriginal explanation necessarily referred to the direction of time\n(see Hurley 1986). Although we just stated the Boltzmannian account of\nentropy increase in terms of entropy increasing into the future, the\nexplanation can be turned around and made for the past\ntemporal direction as well. Given a gas in a box that is in a\nnonequilibrium state, the vast majority of microstates that are\nantecedents of the dynamical evolution leading to the present\nmacrostate correspond to a macrostate with higher entropy\nthan the present one. Therefore, not only is it highly likely that\ntypical microstates corresponding to a nonequilibrium state will\nevolve to  higher entropy states, but it is also highly likely\nthat they evolved from higher entropy states.\n\nConcisely put, the problem is that given a nonequilibrium state at\ntime \\(t_2\\), it is overwhelmingly likely that\n\n(1)\n the nonequilibrium state at \\(t_2\\) will evolve to one closer to\nequilibrium at \\(t_3\\)\n\n\nbut that due to the reversibility of the dynamics it is also\noverwhelmingly likely that\n\n(2)\n the nonequilibrium state at \\(t_2\\) has evolved from one closer\nto equilibrium at \\(t_1\\)\n\n\nwhere \\(t_1 \\lt t_2 \\lt t_3\\). However, transitions described by\n (2)\n do not seem to occur; or phrased more carefully, not both\n (1)\n and\n (2)\n occur. However we choose to use the terms \u201cearlier\u201d and\n\u201clater\u201d, clearly entropy doesn\u2019t increase in both\ntemporal directions. For ease of exposition let us dub\n (2)\n the culprit.\n\nThe traditional problem is not merely that nomologically possible\n(anti-thermodynamic) behavior does not occur when it could. That is\nnot straightforwardly a problem: all sorts of nomologically\nallowed processes do not occur. Rather, the problem is that\nstatistical mechanics seems to make a prediction that is falsified,\nand that is a problem according to anyone\u2019s theory of\nconfirmation.\n\nMany solutions to this problem have been proposed. Generally speaking,\nthere are two ways to solve the problem: eliminate transitions of type\n (2)\n either with special boundary conditions or with laws of nature. The\nformer method works if we assume that earlier states of the\nuniverse are of comparatively low-entropy and that\n(relatively) later states are not also low-entropy states.\nThere are no high-to-low-entropy processes simply because earlier\nentropy was very low. Alternatively, the latter method works if we can\nsomehow restrict the domain of physically possible worlds to those\nadmitting only low-to-high transitions. The laws of nature are the\nstraightjacket on what we deem physically possible. Since we need to\neliminate transitions of type\n (2)\n while keeping those of type\n (1)\n (or vice versa), a necessary condition of the laws doing this job is\nthat they be time reversal noninvariant. Our choice of strategy boils\ndown to either assuming temporally asymmetric boundary conditions or\nof adding (or changing to or restricting to) time reversal\nnoninvariant laws of nature that make entropy increase likely. Many\napproaches to this problem have thought to avoid this dilemma, but a\nlittle analysis of any proposed \u201cthird way\u201d arguably\nproves this to be false.\n\nMotivations for restrictions of type\n (2)\n transitions originate in both philosophy and in particular physical\ntheories. The rest of this section describes some of the wide range of\nviews found on the issue.\n",
