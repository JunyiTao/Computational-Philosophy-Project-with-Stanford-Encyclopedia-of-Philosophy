    "main_text": "The Reason-Statement-Based Conception\n2. The Reason-Statement-Based Conception\n\nThe second version of the distinction foregoes Nagel\u2019s appeal to\nthe \u2018general form\u2019 of the reason, but instead is\nformulated in terms of the reason itself. We call this the\n\u2018reason-statement-based version\u2019 of the distinction\nbecause it holds that whether a reason is agent-relative depends on\nwhether a full statement of the reason itself (forget about its\n\u201cgeneral form\u201d) involves pronominal back-reference to the\nagent for whom it is a reason. Philip Pettit puts forward a\nreason-statement-based version of the distinction:\n\nAn agent-relative reason is one that cannot be fully specified without\npronominal back-reference to the person for whom it is a reason. It is\nthe sort of reason provided for an agent by the observation that\nhe promised to perform the action in prospect, or that the\naction is in his interest, or that it is to the advantage of\nhis children. In each case, the motivating consideration\ninvolves essential reference to him or his.\u2026An agent-neutral\nreason is one that can be fully specified without such an indexical\ndevice. (Pettit 1987: 75)\n\n\nOn Pettit\u2019s account, whether a reason is agent-relative depends\non whether it (the reason) can be fully stated without pronominal\nback-reference to the agent for whom it is a reason. The use of\nanaphoric pronouns in Pettit\u2019s version of the distinction does\nnot really mark much of a departure from Nagel\u2019s formulation.\nFor Nagel\u2019s \u2018free agent variables\u2019 are really\ntechnical devices which function just like anaphoric pronouns by\nreferring back to the agent for whom the consideration is a reason.\nThe real difference between Nagel\u2019s formulation and\nPettit\u2019s is that Nagel\u2019s formulation is cast in terms of\nthe general form of a reason whereas Pettit\u2019s formulation is\ncast in terms of a full statement of the reason itself, which need not\ninvolve any mention of the general form of the reason. For Pettit, the\nfull statement of a reason need not involve a universal quantifier at\nall. One of Pettit\u2019s illustrative examples of a full statement\nof a reason is \u201cthat the action is in his\ninterest\u201d and this statement involves no universal\nquantification whatsoever. So Pettit\u2019s version of the\ndistinction, and more generally the reason-statement-based version of\nthe distinction, seems unlikely to offend against particularist\nsensibilities.\n\nMoreover, Pettit\u2019s distinction seems to do much the same\nphilosophical work as Nagel\u2019s version of the distinction. For in\nboth cases agent-relativity is characterized in terms of a certain\nsort of back-reference to the person for whom the consideration is a\nreason while agent-neutrality is in both cases characterized in terms\nof the absence of such back-reference. The only difference is that for\nNagel the relevant back-reference is to be found in the general form\nof the reason (which turns out to be a universally quantified\nprinciple giving a sufficient condition for the application of the\nreason predicate) whereas for Pettit the relevant back-reference is to\nbe found in a full statement of the reason itself. So far, it looks\nlike we have a kind of dominance argument for the\nreason-statement-based version of the distinction. It seems likely to\ndo much the same work as Nagel\u2019s distinction and mirrors the\nlogical form of Nagel\u2019s distinction, but does so without making\nthe distinction unavailable to particularists.\n\nHowever, the reason-statement-based version of the distinction has\nproblems of its own. Most significantly, this version of the\ndistinction seems to presuppose a particular ontology of reasons, in\nwhich case we end up inviting particularists to the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral party only by rescinding the invitations\nof those who hold opposing ontological views about reasons. For\nsuppose I think that reasons just are facts and also hold that there\nare no distinctively indexical facts. Rather, there are ordinary facts\nwhich can be characterized in indexical terms or characterized in\nnon-indexical terms. So the fact that having a beer at 6:13 p.m. on\nJanuary 17, 2005 would make MR happy is identical to the fact that\nhaving a beer now would make me happy. Here we have one fact which can\nbe expressed in two different ways. Given this package of ontological\nviews, the reason-statement-based version of the distinction looks\nunhelpful. For let us suppose that the fact that having a beer now\nwould give me pleasure provides an agent-relative reason for me to\nhave the beer\u2014a sort of egoistic reason. On the\nreason-statement-based version of the distinction, the reason is\nagent-relative only if a full statement of the reason must\ninvolve pronominal reference to the agent for whom it is a reason.\nHowever, if reasons just are facts (this is my ontology of reasons)\nthen it is simply not true that a full statement of this reason (read:\nthis fact) must involve pronominal back-reference to me. For\ninstead of saying that having a beer would make him happy, you could\nsay that my reason is that having a beer would make MR happy. On the\nontology under consideration, this seems like a full statement (what\nis left out?) of the fact which is my reason to have the beer just as\nmuch as the anaphoric pronominal statement of my reason. Indeed, given\nthese ontological views it is hard to see how any reason could be\nagent-relative since any fact can be given a full statement without\nthe use of indexicals of any kind. Moreover, the problem here is not\nlimited to this particular ontology. Someone who holds that reasons\nare true propositions or states of affairs and who also holds that\nthere are no irreducibly indexical propositions or states of affairs\n(only indexical \u2018modes of presentation\u2019 of such\npropositions or states of affairs) will have trouble making use of the\nreason-statement version of the distinction for just this reason.\n\nThis is not to say that there are not ontologies which would provide a\nframework in which the reason-statement version of the distinction\ncould be useful. Two ontologies spring to mind. First, those who hold\nthat a reason is not just a fact but a fact plus a particular mode of\npresentation (a particular way of grasping the fact, as it were) might\nwell be able to make good use of the reason-statement-based version of\nthe distinction. Second, those who hold that reasons are just facts\nbut also hold that there really are irreducibly indexical facts can\nalso make sense of the reason-statement-based version of the\ndistinction. Still, it seems like a considerable cost that this\nversion of the distinction seems to exclude so many reasonable\nontological views. So whereas Nagel\u2019s principle-based version of\nthe distinction excludes particularists, Pettit\u2019s\nreason-statement-based version of the distinction excludes those who\nhold any of a wide range of ontological views about reasons. We should\nsee if we can do better.\n",
