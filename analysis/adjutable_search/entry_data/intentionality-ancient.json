    "preamble": "\n\nIn recent decades, philosophers frequently refer to\n\u2018intentionality\u2019, roughly, that feature of beliefs,\ndesires, and other mental states in virtue of which they are\nof or about something or more generally, possess\ncontent; contrary to what ordinary usage of \u2018intentional\u2019\nmight suggest, it is not limited to practical states such as intending\nto do something or acting intentionally. The currency of the technical\nterm is due in large part to Edmund Husserl, who took it from his own\nteacher, Franz Brentano. In 1874, Brentano had proposed this feature\nas a criterion of the mental that could be used to demarcate\npsychology from the physical sciences, and he explicitly invoked\nmedieval scholastic terminology (intentio, esse\nintentionale) as a way of reintroducing the notion.\nBrentano\u2019s thesis about the criterion of the mental has had a\ncheckered fate in philosophy. But interest in intentionality in its\nown right has continued unabated.\n\nThis interest has naturally led to questions about the history of the\nnotion. Earlier accounts, following Brentano, looked to late medieval\ndiscussions in Latin and then to their roots in earlier Arabic\nphilosophy. But at that point, it was claimed, the trail peters out\n\u2013 nothing in Greek or Roman philosophy, allegedly, corresponds.\nThis narrative, as one might suspect, rests on questionable\nassumptions. Once the investigation is properly framed, it is clear\nthat philosophical interest in intentionality can be traced all the\nway back to the origins of Western philosophy. Intentionality is\nrecognized as raising serious puzzles already in the early- to\nmid-fifth century bce, arguably first by\nParmenides, but then indisputably by sophists responding to him,\nincluding Gorgias and Protagoras. The first extensive discussions are\nin Plato, who explicitly thematizes the difficulties in several\ndialogues and considers various solutions. Later philosophers develop\nother solutions, which include appeals to internal representations\n(Aristotle), or to nonexistent objects of thought (the first Stoics,\nZeno and Cleanthes), and propositions and other semantic entities\n(other Stoics, beginning with Chrysippus). Even the terminology of\nintentionality can be traced back, through Augustine, to Greek\norigins, namely in the Stoic theory of vision.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The history of the term\n\nThe received view, which takes the notion to originate in Arabic\nphilosophy, traces back to an article by the phenomenologist Herbert\nSpiegelberg, originally published in 1933 (for a translation of a\nrevised version, see Spiegelberg 1976). It turns entirely on\nphilosophical terminology: it only considers texts that use cognates\nof \u2018intention\u2019 in a specific technical sense, that of a\nmental act\u2019s being directed at or referring to\nsomething, in contrast with a usage that applies exclusively to\npractical contexts, where an agent intends to do something.\nSpiegelberg claims that before the high scholastic period, uses of the\nLatin intentio were exclusively practical and so have no\nbearing on the problem of the intentionality of mental states more\ngenerally. The closest antecedents, he claims, are the Arabic\nma\u2019na and ma\u2019qul, which were translated\ninto Latin in the high scholastic period by intentio.\n\nEven when considered simply as a history of the terminology, this\naccount is seriously mistaken. Late scholastic discussions often cite\nAugustine, in particular Book XI of his On the Trinity, in\nwhich intentio plays a central role. And while Augustine does\nidentify intentio there with will (uoluntas) and\neven love (amor), he does not have practical concerns\nexclusively or even primarily in mind. On the contrary, his focus is\non cognition, starting with vision and continuing on with memory,\nthought, and self-knowledge. It is just that he thinks that in order\nto account for the directedness of these states, their analysis must\nultimately include a certain practical element, rather than the other\nway around, where all practical attitudes must be explained in terms\nof cognition. Augustine argues that vision and perception generally\ncannot be analyzed simply into subject and object (as on\nAristotle\u2019s account). That would leave out something essential,\nwhich is needed to direct the sense to the perceptible object and keep\nit fixed on it. Augustine identifies this third element as the\nperceiver\u2019s intentio, which he characterizes as a kind of\nstriving or will. It is precisely because a trio of factors are\nrequired, in fact, that he believes psychology can be useful to\nTrinitarian theology. Since humans are made in God\u2019s image, each\nhuman (or more precisely, each \u201cinner man\u201d) must also\nreplicate God\u2019s triune structure. The role intentio\nplays in cognition is parallel to that of the Holy Spirit, mediating\nbetween the Father and the Son: it mediates between the object and the\ncognitive faculty. Later scholastics were thus right to cite\nAugustine\u2019s use of intentio in discussions of\ncognition, establishing a direct link to late antiquity, independent\nof the contributions of Arabic philosophy, in the history of what\nSpiegelberg called \u201cextra-practical\u201d intentionality.\n\nAugustine, moreover, is adapting and developing earlier Greek views.\nIn Book XII of his Literal Commentary on Genesis, he offers\nan extensive analysis of vision that relies heavily on Stoic theory.\nIn both theories, vision depends on the active role of the\nperceiver\u2019s pneuma (Greek) or spiritus (Latin),\n\u201cbreath\u201d in its original meaning and for the Stoics a kind\nof hot gaseous body, but for Augustine something immaterial. (The same\nwords, not insignificantly, are used in the Christian scriptures for\nthe Holy Spirit). Vision occurs when the pneuma extends\nthrough the optic nerve and the eye to the object, either by reaching\nout through the pupil to make contact with the object directly (as on\nAugustine\u2019s theory) or by pricking and tensing the intervening air\nbeginning at the pupil into a cone with its base at the object (as on\nthe Stoic theory). The words that the Stoic Chrysippus uses for the\nextension of the visual cone to the object are the Greek verb\nenteinein and noun entasis (Diogenes Laertius VII\n157), which are cognate with the Latin intendere and\nintentio. So if our goal was to find not just a continuous\ntransmission of technical terminology for intentionality, but cognates\nof intentio, we could trace it back at least to Greek\ntheories of vision in the third century bce,\nif not still earlier extromission theories of vision. (For further\ndiscussion of Augustine\u2019s theory, as well as the history of the\nterminology, see Caston 2001.)\n\nOther expressions and figures of speech familiar to us from modern\ndiscussions of intentionality can be found in ancient philosophy, even\nthough we cannot trace a continuous connection from them to our own\nusage. Throughout antiquity, for example, we find the antithesis of\n\u2018presence in absence\u2019 (par\u014dn ap\u014dn) to\ndescribe the way a mental state can make something\n\u201cpresent\u201d to the subject that is nevertheless absent from\nthe current surroundings and perhaps even from reality altogether.\nAristotle mentions such presence in absence explicitly as an\naporia or difficulty that must be resolved (On Memory and\nRecollection 1, 450a25 ff.). Certain Stoics speak of immanent\nobjects of thought, items that are literally present \u201cin\nthought\u201d (enno\u0113mata). Later thinkers use the\nphrase \u2018existing in mere thoughts alone\u2019 (en psilais\nepinoiais monais) to characterize merely intentional objects,\nwhich do not exist in reality. Even the metaphor of directedness\n\u2013 of aiming the mind at something (intendere animum\nin), like an arrow \u2013 can be found in ancient texts. In\nPlato\u2019s Cratylus (420b\u2013c),\nSocrates\nsuggests that the word for belief, doxa, derives\netymologically from the word for bow, toxon: it \u201cgoes\ntoward\u201d each thing and how it is in reality. Socrates then\nextends this analysis to the vocabulary for deliberative states: the\nword for plan, boul\u0113, for example, derives from the word\nfor shot, bol\u0113. The metaphor is repeated again in the\nTheaetetus (194a): someone who\nbelieves falsely is \u201clike a bad archer who, in shooting, goes\nwide of the mark and errs\u201d.\n2. The history of the problem\n\nA history of terminology, though, even when done correctly, tracks the\nwrong items. The same technical terms are often used to express very\ndifferent concepts: just consider the philosophical usage of terms\nlike \u2018substance\u2019, \u2018matter\u2019, or even\n\u2018concept\u2019 itself. Conversely, the same concept is often\nexpressed by different terms, some of which may not be technical at\nall, a situation that is especially likely at the beginning of inquiry\ninto a subject. So if terminology is to be used as evidence, much more\nmust be brought into consideration \u2013 simple word searches will\nnot do.\n\nThe terminology, moreover, holds little interest in its own right. In\norder for a history to be philosophically illuminating, it should\nfocus on the concept of intentionality itself or, better still, the\ndivergent conceptions of intentionality that philosophers have had and\ntheir resulting disagreements. These differences afford us the\ngreatest perspective on our own presuppositions and preoccupations, as\nwell as revealing paths and solutions we might not otherwise have\nconsidered. There is thus no need to settle on a single conception as\nthe concept of intentionality at the outset, which would in\nany case only produce a Whiggish history, of development towards and\ndeviations from some favored, but undoubtedly idiosyncratic view. On\nthe contrary, we should take the opposite approach: substantive\ndisagreements between philosophers are potentially the most\ninstructive philosophically.\n\nA philosophical history would therefore do better to focus on the\nhistory of the problem of intentionality: the difficulty,\nthat is, of providing a philosophically adequate account of the nature\nof intentionality in light of its various peculiarities, whatever\nterms may have been used to express it. Such an approach not only\nallows room for different theories of intentionality, but also\ndivergent conceptions, as well as attempts to dissolve the problem,\neither by dismissing the phenomenon entirely or by denying that there\nis any genuine difficulty involved. A history of intentionality that\ndid not include a Parmenides or a Quine would not be very informative,\nespecially if we are trying to understand the difficulty and what is\nat stake.\n\nThe problem of intentionality is the problem of explaining what it is\nin general for mental states to have content, as well as the\nparticular conditions responsible for specific variations in content.\nThe difficulty of providing such an account lies in explaining why\nmental states often seem to violate familiar entailment patterns\n(whether or not we take such violations to be criterial of\nintentionality). To begin with, the content of many mental states does\nnot correspond with what is in the world: what we imagine may not\nexist, our beliefs may be false, our desires may go unfulfilled. To\nput it more paradoxically, a mental state may be about something, even\nif there isn\u2019t any such thing in the world. This is one of a\nnumber of peculiarities that prove difficult to account for, and which\nare sometimes thought to pose a particular stumbling block for\nnaturalistic approaches to the mind. As Wittgenstein once quipped, you\ncan\u2019t hang a man unless he is there, but you can look for him\neven if he\u2019s not, or even if he does not exist at all\n(Philosophical Investigations 1.133, \u00a7462). There are\nother peculiarities as well, concerning our ability to focus\nselectively on certain aspects of objects, without having others in\nmind. For example, while I cannot greet a person without greeting a\nperson of some particular height, I can think of a person without\nthinking of a person of any particular height. I can also entertain\ndifferent attitudes to the same object at the same time, depending on\nthe aspect under which I consider it. So I might believe that the\nMorning Star is a star but that Venus is not one, despite the fact\nthat Venus is the Morning Star; yet for just the same reason,\nwe cannot land a space probe on the one without thereby landing it on\nthe other. These and other difficulties form a loose family of\nphenomena that give rise to the problem of intentionality. Different\nphilosophers may regard these phenomena differently, perhaps focusing\non some but not others, or even excluding some as not belonging\ntogether with the rest. A philosophical history should be generous\nabout such differences: what is important philosophically is that a\nphilosopher recognizes that some of them pose a difficulty, at least\nprima facie, in accounting for mental states. (For further\ndiscussion of the methodology, see Caston 2001)\n3. Before Plato\n\nParmenides of Elea (early 5th century bce) is\narguably the first Greek philosopher to have focused on the\nproblematic nature of intentionality. His poem (transmitted under the\ntitle On Nature) offers a startling revelation of the\nallegedly true nature of reality and appearance, in which the narrator\nis instructed by a goddess that \u201cyou cannot grasp or express\nwhat is not \u2013 it cannot be accomplished\u201d (B2), for\n\u201cthinking cannot be found apart from what is, upon which its\nexpression depends\u201d (B8.35\u201336) and \u201cwhat can be said\nand thought must be what is\u201d (B6). The Greek for the phrases\n\u2018what is\u2019 and \u2018what is not\u2019 are notoriously\nambiguous. But if, as many interpreters maintain (see Owen 1960; Furth\n1968), it should be construed here either in terms of (a)\nwhat does or does not exist, or (b) what is\nor is not the case, or perhaps (c) some fusion of\nthe two, then the goddess is denying the possibility of thinking or\nspeaking either about nonexistent objects, or about nonfactual\nstates-of-affairs, or both, on the basis of the following intuitions.\nIf one is to think or express anything at all, there must be\nsomething that one is thinking or expressing (thus quantifying in).\nBut what is not, by hypothesis, is not there to be thought of\n(cf. B3), since either it does not exist or is not in fact the case;\nand if there isn\u2019t anything there to be thought of, then we must\nnot be thinking of anything either. Parallel problems are supposed to\narise in the case of speech, for statements concerning a nonexistent\nor for false statements.\n\nConcerns about non-existent objects or non-factual states of affairs\nare not explicit in Parmenides\u2019 poem, though \u2013\nunsurprisingly, the goddess does not give examples of what she is\nproscribing. This leaves room for other construals of \u2018what is\nnot\u2019, such as the view that it always requires completion or\nspecification as \u2018what is not F\u2019 for some value\nof F, so that \u2018what is not\u2019 raises concerns about\nnegative predication instead, especially in explanatory and\ncosmological contexts. But of course the precise nature of the\ndifficulty here is not spelled out either, so speculative\nreconstruction is required. In any case, the goddess herself seems to\nuse negation and the phrase \u2018what is not\u2019 quite freely,\nthough perhaps this is just symptomatic of her liminal position at the\nborders of Night and Day (B1).\n\nWhatever Parmenides intended, it is clear that the subsequent\nreception of his poem is concerned precisely with the problem sketched\nabove about what does not exist and what is not the case. Numerous\nproscriptions similar to the goddess\u2019s are reported in the\nremainder of the 5th century, though offered by philosophers with\nquite different motivations and agendas, including Protagoras,\nGorgias, the author of pseudo-Hippocratic treatise On the\nArt, Anaxagoras, Metrodorus of Chios, Euthydemus, Cratylus, and\nAntisthenes. In many of these cases, the denial is explicitly\nformulated as a rejection of the possibility of falsehood, of thinking\nor speaking of what is not the case.\n\nThe sophists Protagoras and Gorgias are of particular interest.\nAccording to Plato, Protagoras held that one cannot believe what is\nnot and that whatever one experiences is true (Theaetetus\n167a). This fits snugly with Protagoras\u2019\nwidely attested doctrine that each human being is \u201cthe measure\nof all things,\u201d which, on any interpretation, excludes the\npossibility of error. But Protagoras\u2019 endorsement reveals an\ninteresting subtlety in the Parmenidean thesis that what is not cannot\nbe thought about \u2013 or more positively, the thesis that if\nsomething is had in mind, it must be. The goddess in Parmenides\u2019\npoem uses this thesis in a negative fashion, moving from the\nassumption that certain things \u2018are not\u2019 to the\nparadoxical conclusion that we cannot actually think about them\neither. But one might equally use it in a positive fashion, as\nProtagoras seems to have done, to move from the assumption that we\ncan in fact think of such things to the conclusion that they\nmust in fact \u2018be\u2019, i.e. exist or obtain, after all. In\nitself, the Parmenidean thesis only makes a conditional claim, and\nprima facie it seems open to employ either modus\ntollens or modus ponens. Depending on whether one\nretains commonplace assumptions about what we can think or about what\nthere is in the world, the Parmenidean thesis can lead to either a\nbloated ontology or a very restricted psychology.\n\nGorgias challenges this thesis in his treatise On Not Being\n(preserved in two slightly different versions in the\npseudo-Aristotelian On Melissus, Xenophanes, and Gorgias and\nin Sextus Empiricus\u2019 Adversus Mathematicos VII 65 ff.).\nIt takes direct aim at Eleatic assumptions, and especially those of\nParmenides, by arguing that (i) there isn\u2019t anything; (ii) even\nif there is something, it cannot be known; and finally, (iii) even if\nsomething can be known, one could not inform anyone of this. The\nsecond part is of particular interest, since Gorgias offers a\nreductio ad absurdum of the Parmenidean thesis, especially\nwhen deployed in the positive way we have just seen in Protagoras.\nGiven that we obviously can have in mind, for example, a chariot-team\nracing on the sea \u2013 in fact, just by reading this, you have put\nit in mind \u2013 it should follow from the Parmenidean thesis that\nthere is a chariot-team racing on the sea; but (pace\nProtagoras) plainly there is not. If both these intuitions are\nmaintained, the only option left is to reject the Parmenidean thesis\nitself: it is not the case that one can only think or speak\nof what is \u2013 thought is not so tightly bound to reality. Gorgias\nimmediately goes on to argue for a sceptical conclusion, on the\ngrounds that we have no basis for telling which mental states\ncorrespond to reality and which do not, and so cannot know anything at\nall. But this further argument rests on having shown that our ordinary\nintuitions about what we can think and what exists or obtains together\nundermine the Parmenidean thesis. (For further discussion, see Caston\n2002a)\n\nWhy should anyone be tempted by the Parmenidean thesis in the first\nplace? A simple intuition may lie behind it, namely, that thought\nconsists in a direct relation to what is thought about (and\nmutatis mutandis for other mental states and what they are\nabout). For given that a relation cannot obtain unless all its relata\nexist or obtain, it will follow that we cannot ever think of what does\nnot exist or obtain (\u201cwhat is not\u201d). To the extent that\nthis direct relational model has a grip on us, we will be forced to\neither Parmenidean or Protagorean conclusions. In fact, we can\nreformulate these assumptions together as an inconsistent triad (using\n\u2018thought\u2019 schematically for mental states more generally,\nand allowing for the ambiguity between \u2018exists\u2019 and\n\u2018obtains\u2019):\n\nThought consists in a direct relation to what is thought\nabout.\nNo relation can obtain unless all its relata exist/obtain.\nSometimes we can think about what does not exist/obtain.\n\n\nEach of these theses possesses a certain intuitive appeal. But taken\ntogether, they are inconsistent, and so at least one has to be given\nup. This does not entirely force our hand, however, since any two of\nthe three are mutually consistent. So there is still room for\ndisagreement among the disputants. As we have seen, some 5th century\nthinkers, including Parmenides himself (on some interpretations) chose\nto maintain (A) and (B), and reject (C). But if this seems too costly,\nas it does to most people, one would need to reject one of the other\ntwo theses instead. An obvious candidate for rejection is (A), that\nthought consists in a direct relation to what is thought about. But\nthere are different ways of going about it. Someone could simply (i)\nreject a relational analysis altogether. But one could also reject (A)\nwhile continuing to accept a relational analysis, so long as (ii) it\ninvolves a relation to something else other than what is\nthought about. Much of the subsequent discussion in ancient philosophy\ncan be seen as an attempt to pursue the latter strategy, (ii), by\nfinding a suitable intermediary: for example, certain Platonists\nappeal to Forms; Aristotle appeals to changes within our body that\nserve as internal representations; the Stoics from Chrysippus onwards\nappeal to abstract semantic objects like propositions; and Epicurus\nappeals to parts of the surfaces of bodies. A third main option,\nthough, would be to retain the direct relational model in (A)\nunchanged, while also preserving the phenomenological intuition in\n(C), and instead abandon the metaphysical assumption in (B), as the\nearliest Stoics did. Whenever one thinks, these Stoics insist, there\nis something that one is thinking about; but it needn\u2019t\nbe anything that exists or obtains. On this Stoic\nview, there are things that do not exist or obtain, which can serve as\nintentional objects of thought and other mental states.\n4. Plato\n\nThroughout his dialogues, Plato emphasizes the relational character of\nvarious mental states: sight, hearing, touch and perception generally,\nmemory, belief, knowledge, concepts, speech, love (Tht.\n152c, 160a\u2013b,\n163e, 188d\u2013189b;\nRep.\nV, 476e, 478b;\nParm. 132b\u2013c;\nSoph. 262e,\n263c; Symp. 199d).\nIn each case, Socrates (or the other main\nspeaker) asks whether the mental state in question is \u201cof\nsomething or of nothing\u201d, and the interlocutors agree that it is\nalways of something \u2013 it is impossible for such a state\nnot to be of anything at all. In the Charmides, Socrates gets\nCritias to agree to something stronger, namely, that many of these\nstates \u2013 seeing, hearing, and other forms of perception, desire,\nintention, love, fear, and belief \u2013 must have an object\nother than themselves; and he suggests that it would be odd\nif knowledge were not like this as well (167c\u2013168a).\nBut in this\nregard, mental states do not differ from other relatives, as he\nhimself emphasizes: Socrates sometimes adds nonintentional cases, such\nas siblings, parents and children, and doubles and halves, in order to\nillustrate his point. In some of the passages above, Socrates follows\nup this question with a further one, which has bearing only for the\nmental states, namely, whether they are always of something\n\u201cthat is\u201d rather than something \u201cthat is not\u201d.\nAlthough the speakers readily agree that these states must always be\nof something that is, the problem of intentionality already looms,\nmerely by his raising the possibility that on occasion some states\nmight be of what is not, either of what is not the case or of what\ndoes not exist. In the Philebus, this alternative is\nexplicitly taken up: just as one can believe something without that\nbelief being of anything that ever was, is, or will be, so one can\nfeel pleasure about something, or fear, anger, and so on, even if it\nis not about anything that ever was, is, or will be. In all such\ncases, the beliefs, pleasures, fears, and so on are said to be\n\u201cfalse\u201d (pseud\u0113, Phlb.40c\u2013e).\n\nMore importantly, there are several passages where Socrates discusses\nfalsehood in belief and speech at length, as a familiar and important\nproblem in need of resolution. In the Cratylus, Socrates says\nthat a great many people, both in the past and in the present, have\nheld that it is impossible to speak falsely, on the grounds that it is\nimpossible to say something without saying something that is;\nCratylus concludes that in such cases, instead of speaking falsely and\nsaying something that is not, the speaker would simply be making\nnoise, no more meaningful than banging a pot (429d\u2013430a).\nA similar\npuzzle about false speech is posed in the Euthydemus,\ninitially by the brothers Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, a visiting tag\nteam of Sophists who are displaying their eristic prowess (283e\u2013284e).\nIt is later\nreprised by Socrates, who attributes it explicitly to\n\u201cProtagoras\u2019 followers\u201d and still earlier thinkers,\nand it is explicitly extended to false belief as well (286c\u2013d).\nThese versions\nof the puzzle frame it in terms of whether one can speak (or think) of\n\u201cwhat is not\u201d: one cannot speak without there being\nsomething that one is saying (or thinking); yet it is impossible for\nthere to be such a thing and for it not to be. But that is what\nspeaking falsely would amount to, since on this view speaking falsely\njust is to say something that is not. Plato never explicitly questions\nthe relational character of speaking and believing or rejects the\nrequirement that the relata must exist or obtain. In the inconsistent\ntriad we considered above, it is the third proposition,\n\u201cSometimes we can think about what does not exist/obtain,\u201d\nwhich is consistently under pressure in these contexts. At the same\ntime, Socrates objects that such a position would be self-undermining\n(Euthyd. 287e\u2013288a),\nthough he does not offer a further diagnosis\nhere.\n\nThe puzzle about false belief recurs in the Theaetetus at a\ncrucial juncture in the dialogue\u2019s main argument. Socrates and\nTheaetetus have rejected the proposal that knowledge is perception and\nwith it the underlying Protagorean view that whatever appears to be\nthe case is the case. Theaetetus\u2019 new proposal, that knowledge\nis true belief, offers no advance, though, unless they can show that\nfalse belief is possible, against sophistic puzzles like we have just\nseen from the Euthydemus; and while Socrates says he has\n\u201coften\u201d worried about this, he claims that he is unable to\nsay what false belief is and how it comes about (187b\u2013e).\nHe then develops\nthe worry in much more elaborate ways than before. There is a fuller\nversion of the puzzle than we have seen so far, which explicitly\nequates believing something \u201cthat is not\u201d with not\nbelieving anything at all (188d\u2013189b).\nBut Socrates also introduces a distinct, new\npsychological worry into consideration. If one assumes that false\nbelief by its very nature has a certain structure, namely, of\nmistaking one thing for another, we must then ask what our cognitive\naccess is to each: do we know each of these, or only one, or neither?\n(188a\u2013c)\nSocrates makes this underlying structure explicit when he goes on to\nanalyze false belief as a kind of \u201cother-believing\u201d\n(allodoxia), where we say in thought that something is one\nthing instead of another (189c\u2013190e).\nThis analysis avoids the earlier difficulty,\nsince both items can be things that are, and it locates error in our\nhaving latched on to the wrong one. From a third-person point of view,\nthis is illuminating, since it exposes precisely why the belief is\nmistaken. But for just the same reason the description is unacceptable\nfrom a first-person point of view for the subject who is taken in: no\none, Socrates insists, would ever say to themselves that\nSocrates is Theaetetus or that one thing is something distinct from it\n(190a\u2013c). And in\nfact Plato repeatedly characterizes thinking as saying something to\noneself, both in this dialogue (189e\u2013190a)\nand later in\nthe Sophist (263e\u2013264a);\nan analogous view also seems to be implicit in\nthe image from Philebus  38e\u201339a\nof an internal\nscribe writing out our beliefs in our soul. This treatment of\nother-believing in the Theaetetus thus seems to presuppose\nthat both terms must be somehow present to thought in order for the\nsubstitution to occur (190d). The possibility\nthat one might have only one of them in the mind, through perception\nor in some other way, and somehow apply it to the wrong thing in the\nworld is not considered (even though it is something that Plato allows\nin the case of incorrect names at Cratylus 430a\u2013431b,\nwhere he\nspeaks of pointing or otherwise exhibiting the thing while applying a\nname to it).\n\nAt this point in the Theaetetus, Socrates proposes a model\nfor how false belief can occur, based on an analogy with how signet\nrings can be impressed into a wax block to produce a sealing: in a\nsimilar way, our thoughts and perceptions make an impression on our\nmemory, leaving behind traces which are signs or representations of\nthe original objects thought about or perceived (191c\u2013d;\n194c\u2013d).\nThese traces can\nthen be deployed in combination with fresh perceptions of objects,\nwith which they may or may not accord, to produce beliefs. When one of\nthese traces does not \u201cfit\u201d an incoming perception, like a\nshoe put on the wrong foot, the combination is incorrect and the\nresulting belief false (193c\u2013194b).\nThe model satisfies both constraints introduced\nby the earlier puzzles: it provides cases of falsehood where we are\nrelated exclusively to things that are, and where both items are in\nsome way present to thought. But as Socrates develops the suggestion,\nit is made to rely crucially on our having different kinds of\ncognitive access to the two items combined in the belief (memory\ntraces, on the one hand, and perceptions, on the other: 195c\u2013d).\nAs such, it does\nnot serve to explain cases where just thoughts are involved, as when\nsomeone incorrectly believes that the sum of 5 and 7 is 11 (195e\u2013196a).\nThis is\nenough to vitiate the account Socrates and Theaetetus have given of\nfalse belief. But there should no longer be an issue about whether\nfalse beliefs are possible, the challenge posed by the\noriginal puzzles, only about whether we have been given a fully\ncomprehensive account. Socrates tries to salvage the theory by\nproposing another model, where having different thoughts is compared\nto grabbing at birds in an aviary (197c\u2013200d).\nHere again\nthe constraints introduced by the earlier puzzles are met, but the\naccount does not seem any more promising, if taken as a general theory\nof false belief. It is soon given up after being subjected to a number\nof objections, and Socrates returns to the dialogue\u2019s main\nconcern with knowledge. \n\nThe Theaetetus does not have much to say about intentionality\nmore broadly, in particular about the intentionality of the\nperceptions and thoughts that are combined in belief \u2013 the\ndialogue\u2019s attention to these issues is limited, understandably,\nby the exigencies of the main argument. Perception had earlier been\ndismissed as not being in a position even to attain truth (186e),\nmuch less being capable of falsehood; but little\nis said about how perceptual content should be understood. The final\nsection of the dialogue briefly raises an important problem about the\nintentionality of thought, however, which is entirely distinct from\nthe problems involving falsehood or nonexistence. If one has a true\nbelief about something, but not knowledge, and in particular does not\ngrasp how that thing differs from all other things, Socrates worries,\nthen how does the belief manage to be about the very thing it is in\nfact about? How can thoughts of general characteristics, that are\nshared equally by other things, \u201cmake me think of Theaetetus\nrather than of Theodorus, or of the most distant Mysian, as the saying\ngoes?\u201d (209b) This is an especially\nclear statement (in all likelihood the first) of what Chisholm would\nlater call \u201cthe problem of objective reference.\u201d And his\nreading of the Theaetetus may well be what lies behind\nWittgenstein\u2019s own statement of the puzzle: \u201cWhat makes my\nrepresentation of him a representation of him? Not the\nsimilarity of the image.\u201d (Phil. Invest., II.177,\n\u00a7iii)\n\nPlato offers a solution to the puzzles about falsehood in the\nSophist. It goes unchallenged in the text and may well have\nbeen regarded by him as definitive. (It need not be a recent discovery\non Plato\u2019s part, as is often assumed; he needn\u2019t have been\nstumped by these puzzles himself when he composed the earlier\npassages: see Burnyeat 2002.) In this dialogue, when the Eleatic\nvisitor introduces the puzzles about false belief and speaking\nfalsely, he points out the danger of contradicting oneself, invoking\nParmenides\u2019 proscriptions against speaking of what is not\n(236e\u2013237c). But\nhe also insists that we must find a way of reconstruing such claims,\nif we are to show that falsehood is possible (240d\u2013241b)\nwithout\ncommitting patricide against \u201cFather Parmenides\u201d (241d).\nThe subsequent solution turns on recognizing a\ncomplexity in the structure of statements, between the subject, which\nis named in the statement, and what is said about it, as expressed by\nthe predicate (261d\u2013262d).\nStatements are no longer thought of on the model\nof names, which are true if they name something \u201cthat is.\u201d\nInstead, for a statement to be meaningful, one part of it must\nsuccessfully name something and the other say something about it,\nwhich may be either true or false of this. Something analogous will\nhold for belief, the visitor says, as belief is taken to be a kind of\ninternal assertion made by the soul (263d\u2013264b).\nAs we have\nseen, several features of this solution are already prefigured in the\nTheaetetus: both the requirement that thought and speech be\nrelated only to what is, and the insight that the complexity of\nstatements and beliefs allows for error to occur in a mismatch of the\nparts or a misapplication of one to the other. But it is only in the\nSophist that this mismatch is explicitly characterized in\nterms of the difference between things that are, rather than\nsimply being about \u201cwhat is not.\u201d A false statement\nasserts what is not the case regarding the subject, by stating that\nthe subject is other than it in fact is (263a\u2013d).\nThe analysis in\nthe Sophist appears incomplete as it stands, though, since it\nonly applies to subject-predicate sentences, where the subject\nsucceeds in referring to something (262e,\n263c): it is unclear how the visitor would\nhandle other types of statements, much less negative existentials\n(such as \u2018there are no witches\u2019). It also gives no account\nof naming or nonpropositional attitudes. But, again, if we consider\nonly the original challenge posed by Parmenides and the Sophists,\nnamely, to show that falsehood is possible, then Plato has clearly\nsucceeded in providing an answer.\n5. Aristotle\n\nMedieval theories of intentionality \u2013 not to mention more recent\nphilosophers influenced by these theories, such as Brentano (1874\n[1995]) \u2013 draw their inspiration from Aristotle\u2019s theory\nof perception and thought, in particular his doctrine that in\ncognition the form of the sensible or intelligible object is\n\u201creceived without the matter\u201d (On the Soul II 12,\n424a17\u201324; III 2, 425b23\u201324; III 4, 429a15\u201319; and\nIII 8, 431b26\u201329) and the doctrine that the object, or more\nprecisely its activity as an object of cognition, is \u201cone and\nthe same\u201d as the activity of cognition and is present in the\ncognizing subject (III 2, 425b25\u2013426a27). Both perception and\nthought are intentional states, and Aristotle\u2019s analyses of them\nare central to his psychological theory as a whole. But none of these\npassages gives clear evidence of Aristotle\u2019s awareness of the\nproblem of intentionality, much less provides a definition of\nintentionality or any of its essential features. To begin with, each\ndoctrine applies to more than just intentional states. The impression\nof signet ring in sealing wax is offered not merely as an analogy, but\nas a genuine example of a form\u2019s being received without the\nmatter, a point accepted even by commentators such as John Philoponus\nand Thomas Aquinas; Philoponus also mentions images in mirrors as\nanother example (Philoponus, On Aristotle\u2019s On the\nSoul, 444.17\u201326, 437.19\u201325; Thomas Aquinas On\nAristotle\u2019s On the Soul 2.24, 56\u201359 = \u00a7554). This\ndoctrine cannot therefore provide a sufficient condition for\nintentionality, still less for cognition or awareness. Similarly,\nAristotle defends his claim that the object\u2019s activity is one and\nthe same as the activity of cognition and present in the cognizing\nsubject as simply an instance of a much wider causal generalization:\nin every causal interaction, including inanimate and noncognitive\nones, the activity of the agent is one and the same as the activity of\nthe patient and occurs in the patient (On the Soul III 2,\n426a2\u201311). Further, neither of these doctrines holds for all\nintentional states: each fails to apply to paradigmatic cases of\nintentionality, like dreams or future hopes, where the problem of\nintentionality is most palpable. So neither doctrine provides a\nnecessary condition for intentionality either. They are rather general\ncausal doctrines that apply to a special class of intentional states,\nlike perception and thought, where the intentional state is about what\nbrings it about \u2013 that is, it is about its own cause \u2013\nsomething that is not true of intentional states in general. Even if\nthey prove to be central to his theory of intentionality,\nthey do not directly address the problem as such.\n\nAristotle is, however, keenly aware of the special character of\nintentional states. In fact, he excoriates his predecessors for\nfailing to account for intentional states whose objects are\nnot the causes that bring them about. In the second chapter\nof his essay On Memory and Recollection, he rejects the idea\nthat thought extends, like a ray, to its object, because we\n\u201cthink in the same way even when they do not exist\u201d: in\nsuch cases a ray will not work, since there won\u2019t be anything\nfor it to extend to (452b9\u201311). He goes further in his\npolemic On Ideas (81.25\u201382.1), when he rejects Platonic\ntheories that take our thoughts to be of Platonic forms. Because such\nobjects supposedly always exist, whether or not the individuals that\nfall under them do, this sort of theory evades the previous criticism:\ngiven such intermediaries, there is something thought can\nreach. But, Aristotle objects, they cannot account for the full range\nof thoughts we actually have, since we can think of particular\nindividuals who no longer exist, like Socrates, and mythical creatures\nthat \u201cdo not exist in any way at all,\u201d like the\nhippocentaur. In such cases, there is no Platonic form that can serve\nas the object of thought: by the Platonists\u2019 own lights, there\nis no form of Socrates or of Hippocentaur. So simply positing a\nspecial object of the same type as a Form won\u2019t suffice. \n\nAristotle seems confident that his own theory has the resources to\ndeal with both sets of counterexamples. He believes there are changes\nin our bodies that represent or model the objects in\nquestion (without being instances of the exact same type), and by\nundergoing these changes we are able to have thoughts with the\nrelevant contents, whether or not the corresponding objects exist in\nthe world at large. He describes such changes as phantasmata,\na term often translated as \u2018images.\u2019 But while such\nrepresentations are underlie imagistic experiences, such as\nvisualization and dreams, they also bear content in the absence of\nsuch experience. Aristotle deploys phantasmata throughout his\npsychology, both in cognitive states, like thought and memory, and in\ndesires, passions, and action. The underlying capacity, which he calls\nphantasia, is formally introduced in On the Soul III\n3 in response once again to the problem of intentionality. According\nto Aristotle, his predecessors are unable to explain how error could\never take place. On their view, all cognition is about what brings it\nabout, such that \u201clike is known by like,\u201d and this, he\nbelieves, precludes the possibility of error (427a9\u2013b6). But to\nthe extent Aristotle himself explains perception and thought along\nsimilar lines, he will be vulnerable to the same criticism; and\nconsistent with this, he actually regards both states (at least in\ntheir most basic forms, which we might call \u2019sensation\u2019\nand \u2019understanding\u2019) as incapable of falsehood. But unlike\nhis predecessors, Aristotle does not think that all mental\nstates are to be explained on this simple model. As he immediately\ngoes on to argue, phantasia is a distinct kind of mental\nstate that cannot be reduced to sensation, understanding, belief, or\neven a combination of belief and perception (428a24\u2013b9). It\nconsists in perceptual traces, which are capable of affecting the\ncentral organ in the same way that perceptual stimulations do and so\ncapable of producing similar experiences even in the absence of the\ncorresponding external objects. It is this, he claims, that makes\nfalsehood possible and so explains the actions and reactions of\nanimals (428b10\u2013429a8).\n\nThought, Aristotle insists, always requires a phantasma\n(On the Soul III 7, 431a16\u201317, b2; III 8,\n432a8\u201310; On Memory 1, 449b31). But the content of even\nthe simplest concept goes beyond that contained in any such\nquasi-perceptual representations (On the Soul III 8,\n432a12\u201314). At a minimum, in thought we are able to focus\nselectively on certain features, by ignoring many of the other\nfeatures in such representations, just as we can use a diagram of a\ntriangle for mathematical purposes without being concerned with its\nparticular dimensions, and so effectively abstract them\n(On Memory 1, 449b31\u2013450a17). But we are also capable\nof using one concept to form the opposite concept and of applying one\nconcept to another to result in a compound propositional thought\ncapable of truth or falsehood (On the Soul III 6;\nMetaphysics VI 4, IX 10; On Interpretation 1). The\nabstract content that results from such operations allows us to use\nsymbols to speak and understand one another (On\nInterpretation 1, 16a3\u20139).\n\nAristotle also considers higher-order perception and thought. He\noffers a regress argument at the beginning of On the Soul III\n2 to show that when we perceive that we see or hear, we have a\nhigher-order perceptual awareness of the first-order perceiving\n(425b12\u201325) and, while the precise details are a matter of\ncontroversy, it is arguably the same act of perception being directed\nat itself (Caston 2002b; for a response, see Johansen 2005).\nBut Aristotle elsewhere claims that in general states like knowledge,\nperception, belief, or thought are always directed at something\nelse primarily and themselves only peripherally or \u201con the\nside\u201d (en parerg\u014di); only God\u2019s\nself-reflexive thinking, which he characterizes as a \u201cthinking\nof thinking\u201d (no\u0113sis no\u0113se\u014ds), has\nitself as its primary object (Metaph. XII 9,\n1074b34\u201336). Self-directed intentionality raises a number of\nquestions, in particular whether Aristotle is committed to it being a\npart of every mental act \u2013 as he seems to claim at\nNicomachean Ethics IX 9, 1170a29\u2013b1, which Brentano\n1874 [1995], Book II, chs 2\u20134 takes up and champions \u2013 and\nwhether he thinks it is possible to be in error about the content or\ncharacter of the first-order state, even if not about its existence\n(Caston 2002b).\n6. The Stoics\n\nThe earliest Stoics seem committed to preserving the intuition that\nwhenever we are in a mental state, there is something that\nour mental state is of or about. But they reject the Parmenidean\nrequirement that this must be something \u201cthat is\u201d,\nsomething that exists or obtains. On the contrary, they claim that\n\u201cin the nature of things, some things are and some are\nnot,\u201d since the nature of things includes \u201canything that\ncomes to mind, such as centaurs, giants or anything else made up by a\nfalse thought.\u201d (Seneca Letter 58.15) Accordingly,\nthese Stoics regard Something as the highest genus, rather\nthan What is or What has being, as Plato had.\nWhenever a phantasia or representation is of something which\ndoes not in fact exist, there still is something our representation is\nof, which they call a phantasma, an \u201capparition\u201d\nor \u201cfigment\u201d. Even though it does not exist, on this view\nit is still something and so can serve as the object of our mental\nstate.\n\nThis position does not seem to have to have arisen from idle\nspeculation, but rather as part of a response to Plato. The first two\nheads of the school, Zeno of Citium and Cleanthes of Assos, argue that\nthere are no such things as Plato\u2019s forms. The concept\n(ennoia) of a kind, that is, of a genus or species, is a\nthought of what they call an enno\u0113ma, an object that is\nquite literally \u201cin a thought\u201d (en +\nno\u0113ma), an \u201cimmanent object\u201d, but is found\nonly in thought. The precise nature of these objects is\ncontroversial. According to one source (Stobaeus, 1.136.21 ff.), they\nare \u201cnot something\u201d and so not something\nqualified in a certain way, but only \u201cas if\u201d they were\nsomething and \u201cas if\u201d they were qualified; they are\nfurther said to be only \u201capparitions\u201d or\nphantasmata, something merely represented. On this basis,\nmost interpretations take the Stoics to hold that the objects of these\nthoughts are \u201cnot-somethings\u201d (outina): fictions\nor figments that are so beyond the pale, allegedly, that they do not\neven count as something. But so understood, the Stoic view\nwould be deeply obscure, if not actually incoherent. If the objects of\nthese thoughts are not something, they are not anything, on pain of\ncontradiction. That, after all, was the point of claiming that\nSomething is the highest or most comprehensive genus:\neverything is something. But if there are no such things,\nthen what is gained by replacing Platonic forms with\nenno\u0113mata, rather than simply eliminating Platonic forms\naltogether? Worse, what becomes of the intuition that whenever we have\na representation, there is something that our representation\nis of?\n\nThe earliest Stoics do think they have gained something by this move,\nthough. They appeal, unsurprisingly, to both genera and species in\ncharacterizing the methods of definition and division, which they take\nto be central to logic and reasoning. Far from being a blank nothing,\nthese objects are distinguished from one another in terms of their\ncommon features and differences, as they would have to be for the\nclassificatory system required for dialectic and science. The Stoics,\nmoreover, explicitly quantify over these objects: there is,\nin fact, a distinct object of thought for each number (Plotinus\nEnneads 6.6.12.13\u201329). In referring to them as\n\u201capparitions\u201d (phantasmata), moreover, the Stoics\nare not eliminating them. They are recognizing them as something that\nour mind is directed towards whenever something general\n\u201cappears\u201d to us or is represented (phantasia).\nFor as we have seen, they hold that whatever appears to us is\nsomething, even if it is not something that exists or obtains.\nThe natural move for the Stoics, then, would be to say that while\nPlatonic forms aren\u2019t anything at all \u2013 there are\nno such things \u2013 there are such things as\nenno\u0113mata; they just aren\u2019t anything that\nis, that exists or obtains. And in fact a parallel report in\nDiogenes Laertius can be read in precisely this way: although an\nenno\u0113ma is not anything that exists and so does\nnot possess qualities, it is nevertheless \u201cas if\u201d it were\nsomething that exists and \u201cas if\u201d it possessed\nqualities, \u201clike the impression of a horse when none is\npresent\u201d (Diogenes Laertius VII 61). In such a case, what I\nimagine is something and indeed something horse\u2013like; but it is\nnot a real horse or anything existent, and so on their view not\nsomething that can act or be acted upon and so not a body. It is\nmerely an object of thought.\n\nSuch generic objects will further be incomplete or indeterminate. It\nwill not be true to say that the generic human (genikos\nanthr\u014dpos) is Greek, for example, or equally to say that it\nis not Greek, even in an \u201cas if\u201d sort of way, since some,\nbut not all, humans are Greek (Sextus Empiricus, Adv. math.\nVII 246). A generic object will be \u201cas if\u201d it were\nF if, and only if, all the individuals falling under\nit are F. This claim need not violate the Principle of the\nExcluded Middle, since it would still be true of the generic human\nthat it is either Greek or not Greek, since it is\ntrue that all humans are either Greek or not Greek. But it would\nviolate the Principle of Bivalence, since it still will be neither\ntrue nor false to say that the generic human is Greek. (For further\ndiscussion of enno\u0113mata, see Caston 1999.)\n\nThe third head of the school, Chrysippus of Soli, avoids these\nproblems by appealing instead to \u201cthat which can be said\u201d\nor \u201cmeant\u201d (lekta, lit. \u2018sayables\u2019),\ncertain abstract objects that are signified by our words.\nLekta, like place, void, and time, cannot themselves either\nact or be acted upon, and so in the Stoics\u2019 view cannot be\nbodies, which are the only existents they recognize; all such entities\nare instead classified as \u201cincorporeals\u201d\n(as\u014dmata). But lekta will still be\nsomething, since in each case there is something that our\nwords signify; it is just that they \u201csubsist\u201d\n(huphestanai) rather than exist (einai), as the\nStoics sometimes say. Unlike enno\u0113mata, however, they\nwill not generally be the objects of mental states (except\nperhaps when we are thinking about Stoic semantics, for example). They\nserve rather as the contents of mental states, which can be\narticulated in language, regardless of which objects (if any) these\nstates are directed towards (Sextus Empiricus Adv. math. VIII\n11\u201312, 70, 409; Diogenes Laertius VII 63). There are\nlekta corresponding to general terms and predicates, as well\nas to sentences of all kinds: not only to simple and molecular\npropositions (axi\u014dmata), but also questions, commands,\noaths, suggestions, prayers, and so on (Sextus Empiricus Adv.\nmath. VIII 71\u201373; Diogenes Laertius VII 66\u20138). For\nChrysippus, moreover, a definition like \u2018a human is a rational\nmortal animal\u2019, should not be construed as being about a generic\nobject, even in an \u201cas if\u201d sort of way. Rather it has the\nsame meaning as the universal generalization, \u2018if something is a\nhuman, then that thing is a rational mortal animal\u2019 (Sextus\nEmpiricus Adv. math. XI 8\u201311). But such a proposition\ncommits us to nothing more than the relevant individuals that\nsatisfy it (if indeed there are any) and to the lekta\nsignified by its predicates. Finally, unlike generic objects,\nlekta are not indeterminate. It is simply false to\nclaim that what is expressed by the predicate \u2018is a human\u2019\nis itself a human (and likewise simply true that the predicate\n\u2018is a predicate\u2019 is itself a predicate). Therefore,\nlekta need not pose a threat to the Principle of\nBivalence.\n\nOne of the most tantalizing questions concerns the relationship\nbetween mental representations (phantasiai) and\nlekta. The Stoics effectively endorse a version of\nBrentano\u2019s Thesis that intentionality is the criterion of the\nmental, which demarcates the domain of psychology. The Stoics think\nthat representations are what set animals and humans apart from plants\nand inanimate substances: only things with psuch\u0113 or\nsoul have mental representations (phantasiai) of the world\nand make efforts (hormai) to move and change things (Origen\nOn Principles 3.1.2, 196.12\u2013197.8 Koetschau). But they also\nthink that representations are a pervasive feature of psychological\nphenomena: every mental state either is a representation or involves\none essentially, because it is an assent to a representation as\ncorrect or rejection of it as incorrect or withholding assent from it\naltogether. So representation (phantasia) is a feature of all\nand only mental states. Lekta constitute the content of these\nrepresentations. The Stoics in fact define them as \u201cwhat subsists in\ncorrespondence with a rational representation,\u201d where a rational\nrepresentation is one that belongs to rational animals like ourselves\n(Diogenes Laertius VII 63; Sextus Empiricus Adv. math. VII\n51).\n\nThis definition, though, also poses a difficulty. In recent decades,\nit has been thought to imply that lekta subsist only\nin connection with the representations of rational animals \u2013\nsomething not stated explicitly in our reports \u2013 even though\nthis would have problematic consequences: it would imply that\nnonrational animals and indeed very young humans, before they develop\nreason, would either paradoxically have representations without any\ncontent at all or solely with nonconceptual content that could not be\narticulated. (For a classic statement of the view, see Frede 1983\n[1987], 153\u201354, 156; for a discussion of the consequences, see\nSorabji 1993, 20\u201328.) Neither the Stoics nor their critics ever\nmention such consequences, and it would make it difficult, if not\nimpossible, for them to account for animal behavior, much less the\nemergence of reason itself in humans. They insist that we have no\nconcepts (ennoiai) at birth, comparing the mind to a blank\nsheet of papyrus, ready to be written upon: it is first inscribed by\nperceptions and then subsequently, through the sorting and collection\nof perceptual memories, by experience, issuing in our first natural\nconcepts, from which we can later construct even more complex\nconcepts. Reason only appears later \u2013 some sources say at age\nseven, others at fourteen \u2013 when there are sufficient concepts\nto form a stable, interrelated system (Aetius 4.11.1\u20134; Plutarch\nOn Common Conceptions 1084f\u20131085a;\nDiogenes\nLaertius VII 53). So on the Stoics\u2019 view, children will possess\nconcepts at some stage before they have reason, since reason\nemerges from the cumulative acquisition and systematization of\nconcepts, and evidently some of these concepts are formed naturally\nfrom perceptions and memories alone, unaided by reason, from which\nthey presumably derive their content at least in part. Since all these\nstates undoubtedly possess content, there is no principled ground for\ndenying analogous content in the case of representations in\nnonrational animals either, at least for perceptual\nrepresentations.\n\nIf lekta serve here, as elsewhere, as the content of these\nstates, then lekta will not correspond solely to\nrational representations. But how, one might reasonably ask, can the\nrepresenations in nonrational animals and very young humans, who are\nwithout concepts and incapable of articulate speech, have\nlekta corresponding to them? There is a widespread assumption\nin the secondary literature that whether a lekton corresponds\nto a representation depends upon which concepts (if any) an individual\npossesses. But the Stoics cannot accept this assumption. Quite the\ncontrary. They believe that a lekton is involved in\nevery causal interaction, whether animate or inanimate: one\nbody causes a lekton to become true or hold of another body,\nwhere the lekton specifies the fully determinate effect of\nthe agent on the patient (Stobaeus 1.138.14; Sextus Empiricus Adv.\nmath. 9.211; Clement of Alexandria Stromata\n8.9.3\u20134; this point is rightly emphasized by Frede 1994). But\nthis analysis of causation immediately becomes pertinent once we\nacknowledge that the Stoics also hold a causal theory of\nrepresentation: they define representations as the effect \u2013\nliterally, an \u201cimpression\u201d (tup\u014dsis) \u2013\nthat in the paradigmatic case the object of representation produces on\nthe soul (which on their view is a body); and they expressly compare\nthis to the impression a signet ring makes in wax (Diogenes Laertius\nVII 50; Aetius 4.12.1\u20134; Plutarch On Common Conceptions\n1084f\u20131085a),\nand they appeal to sigillary language again when they define the\n\u201csecure\u201d representation they regard as the criterion of\ntruth and foundation of knowledge (phantasia\nkatal\u0113ptik\u0113), which represents the object that produces\nit in such rich detail that it could be distinguished from anything\nelse, no matter how similar (Cicero Acad. 2.77\u201378; Sextus\nEmpiricus Adv. math. 7.248 ff.; Diogenes Laertius VII\n46).\n\nWhenever an object produces a representation, then, there will be a\ncorresponding lekton that specifies the object\u2019s fully\ndeterminate effect on the soul: not only that it is a representation\nand a representation of a certain sort, but one that represents\nobjects in the world as having various features and standing in\nvarious relations, potentially in extraordinarily rich detail.\nEmbedded within this complex lekton will be a clause that\nexhaustively expresses the content: if all such lekta can be\ncaptured with the schema, \u2018\u2026 forms a representation\nthat \u2013\u2019, whatever fills the second blank will express\nthe total content of the representation. None of this requires concept\npossession or even conceptual abilities: which lekton belongs\nto a representation is determined causally by the interaction of a\nspecific object and a specific subject in certain conditions, so long\nas the subject is capable of forming a representation when affected by\nappropriate objects in the right way. Perceptual representations even\nin nonrational animals will ordinarily have tremendously detailed\ncontents, which cannot be exhaustively expressed by a simple\nproposition, as part of the corresponding lekton. Humans can\ngo further than nonrational animals, though, through their ability to\nfocus selectively on individual parts of such content and respond\ndifferentially, assenting to some, rejecting others, and withholding\nassent on still others. This ability to consider isolated contents is\nwhat allows rational animals to entertain abstract representations,\nwhose total content can be expressed by a simple proposition;\nor indeed to entertain any content formed by logical operations upon\nthese (possibly recursively). It is therefore only by reference to the\ncontents of rational representations that we are able to capture the\nfull domain of lekta, much as the definition in Diogenes\nLaertius and Sextus Empiricus suggests, so as to include abstract as\nwell as perceptual representations. But this does not exclude\nnonrational animals from also having lekta corresponding to\ntheir representations, thus making intentional explanations of their\nbehavior possible and psychology more generally. (For more on Stoic\nrepresentations and a fuller defense of the interpretation above, see\nCaston forthcoming.)\n",
