Thus, if the clear evidence is that there are sense-data\nwith a certain character, then that must be accepted and incorporated\ninto one\u2019s theory of the world. And if the character of your\nexperiences means that you cannot be a body then that must also be\naccepted. He arrives with few metaphysical prejudices.\n\nHowever, Price\u2019s understanding of evidence is revealing. For\ninstance, his novel arguments against both materialism and Cartesian\nforms of dualism come down to their conflict with evidence\n\u201cdiscovered by straightforward empirical methods\u201d (1953b:\n45), for such phenomena as unconscious processes, those he calls\n\u201csupernormal cognition\u201d (such as telepathy), and the\ndivided self (especially 1953b: 43\u201347) (for discussion: Dilley\n1995: xviif; Martin 2000: 222).\n\nAlso, the evidence relevant to philosophical questions goes beyond\nwhat the sciences tell us: Price famously claims (1953a: 2ff),\nemploying a pattern of argument that he repeatedly uses (more examples\nbelow, e.g.,\n \u00a72.3),\n that, since our scientific beliefs depend on the beliefs that our\nexperiences give us, the scientific picture of the world cannot\nundermine those basic beliefs, because unless we can rely on those\nbasic beliefs we cannot rely on the science constructed on their basis\n(see also 1930a: 34\u201335). An important theme is to examine the\nexperiences upon which our beliefs are based and to inquire into the\nways they justify our beliefs. Evidence from experience is more\nimportant and basic for Price than scientific evidence.\n\nQuinton (1973: 195) attributes Price\u2019s argument\u2019s\ninfluence as the source of the discredit of\n\u201cscientifically-based reasoning\u201d about perception, at\nleast until Smart, Armstrong, and Pitcher reanimated such arguments in\nthe 1960s (for discussion: Bradie 1976: 42ff). Price declares, from\nour perspective somewhat oddly, that the investigation into perception\nis not a question for science: science does not tell us what seeing\nand touching are, but merely what their causes are (1932: 2). Price\ncontrasts physiological investigations, that is to say science, and\n\u201cimmanent or phenomenological\u201d ones, which is to say\nphilosophy (1932: 10; for discussion: Hamlyn 1961: 173, 178). Thus,\nphilosophy uniquely contributes to knowledge and evidence via his type\nof phenomenological investigations; it is no mere handmaiden to\nscience. He also articulates another role for philosophy independent\nof \u201cthe progress of empirical research\u201d, where\n\u201cgreat problems\u201d, \u201cpuzzles\u201d, are \n\n\ndissolved, rather than solved, by dragging to light ambiguities,\nconfusions, and unconscious preconceptions [\u2026and] by inventing\na more flexible and less equivocal terminology.
