    "main_text": "Consciousness and Cognition\n3. Consciousness and Cognition\n\n\nSpeculations on the nature and function of consciousness have a long \nand complex history in Indian Buddhism. In the canonical literature \nthe term that most often translates as consciousness \n(vij\u00f1\u0101na) is synonymously used for designating \n\u2018mind\u2019 or the \u2018life principle\u2019 in the most \ngeneric sense of those terms. In a technical sense, consciousness \ndesignates either the type of awareness that arises depending on any \nof the six sensory domains (\u0101yatana) or awareness as \none of the five aggregates of existence. In addition, consciousness \nis also listed as one of the twelve factors or causes \n(nidana) in the chain of dependently arising \n(prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da) phenomena. However, it is only\nin the Abhidharma scholastic that we come across systematic attempts \nto understand the dynamic processes of consciousness and cognition. \nIndeed, the Abhidharma synthesis may be rightly viewed as a theory of\nconsciousness (cf. Piatigorsky 1984, 8).\n",
