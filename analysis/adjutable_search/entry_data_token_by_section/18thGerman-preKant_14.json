    "main_text": "Women and Other Under-Represented Thinkers || Women and the Thomasian Philosophy\n6.1 Women and the Thomasian Philosophy\n\nWomen played crucial roles in the conception, refinement, and\npopularization of the key ideas and systems of the German\nEnlightenment, as can be seen by considering their contributions to\nand connections with the two major early philosophical schools of the\nperiod already discussed: the Leibnizian-Wolffian and the\nThomasian(-Pietist). With respect to Thomasius, it should be noted\nthat he makes quite clear himself that his intention in publishing his\nworks in logic and ethics in the vernacular was to reach a wider\naudience, including women. Thus, the subtitle of his Introduction\nto the Doctrine of Reason indicates that it will show\n\n\nin an intelligible manner [how] to distinguish the true, probable, and\nfalse from one another and to discover new truths, all without\nsyllogistics, for all reasonable people of whatever estate or gender\nthey might be.\n\n\nAmong those women impacted by Thomasius\u2019 logic is Dorothea\nChristiane Erxleben (n\u00e9e Leporin, 1715\u201362), who\nwould later receive the first doctorate in medicine in Germany from\nthe university in Halle in 1753. In 1742 she published a treatise\nentitled Gr\u00fcndliche Untersuchung der Ursachen, die das\nweibliche Geschlecht vom Studiren abhalten (Rigorous\nInvestigation of the Causes that Obstruct the Female Sex from\nStudy). While Erxleben there draws on a variety of sources,\nincluding Wolffian thought (cf. Stiening 2020), she makes good use of\ntwo aspects of Thomasius\u2019 logic, namely, his\npractically-oriented account of learnedness, and the doctrine\nof prejudice presented in the concluding chapter (cf. Dyck 2021c). So,\nin the Rigorous Investigation, Erxleben defines learnedness\n(\u201cGelehrsamkeit\u201d) as\n\n\na grounded knowledge of such necessary and useful truths whereby\nthe understanding and will, and consequently true human happiness, are\nimproved. (Erxleben 1742: \u00a721 [2019: 44]; italics in\noriginal)\n\n\nProceeding from this, she contends that it is important that and\nentirely possible for women to be able to attain such learnedness for\nsake of the concerns of ordinary life.\n\nFurther, Erxleben identifies the widespread conviction that the\nattainment of learnedness is unsuitable for women as the result of\nprejudice, of which Erxleben distinguishes four principal types: that\nwomen are unsuited (in virtue of their natural capacities) to attain\nlearnedness; that its attainment could not be useful for them; that\nlearnedness could only be misused by women; and that women would only\nseek to attain learnedness to distinguish themselves from their peers.\nBy way of rebutting these prejudices, Erxleben draws on an array of\nsources, including theological, philosophical, and medical\nauthorities, and argues generally that whatever disparities might\ncurrently obtain between the apparent talents and achievements on the\npart of each sex are not the result of a difference in natural\ncapacities but instead only evidence of the salutary effect of\neducation on the human being (cf. Erxleben 1742: \u00a771).\n",
