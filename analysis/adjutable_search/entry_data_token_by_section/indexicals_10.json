    "main_text": "Kaplan\u2019s Theory of Indexicals || An Example (Again) and Kaplan\u2019s Distinctions\n3.1 An Example (Again) and Kaplan\u2019s Distinctions\n\n\nLet us consider again an example that can motivate Kaplan\u2019s\ntheory.\n\n(11)\n\nMary: \u201cI am a philosopher.\u201d\nJohn: \u201cI am a philosopher.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nMary and John utter the same unambiguous sentence, yet they say\ndifferent things, for Mary says that she is a philosopher whereas John\nsays that he is a philosopher. Moreover, we can imagine that Mary is a\nphilosopher and John is not, so what Mary says is true whereas\nwhat John says is false. In view of these considerations,\nKaplan (1989a) proposes a distinction between two kinds of meaning,\ncharacter and content. The sentence \u2018I am a\nphilosopher\u2019 has a single character, but has different contents\nwith respect to different contexts. Kaplan usually identifies character\nwith linguistic meaning, which is a kind of meaning fixed by linguistic\nconvention.\n",
