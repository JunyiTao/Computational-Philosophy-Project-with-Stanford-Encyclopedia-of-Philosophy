    "main_text": "What Is Music? || The Definition of \u201cMusic\u201d\n1.2 The Definition of \u201cMusic\u201d\n\nExplications of the concept of music usually begin with the idea that\nmusic is organized sound. They go on to note that this\ncharacterization is too broad, since there are many examples of\norganized sound that are not music, such as human speech, or the\nsounds non-human animals and machines make. There are two further\nkinds of necessary conditions philosophers have added in attempts to\nfine tune the initial idea. One is an appeal to \u201ctonality\u201d\nor essentially musical features such as pitch and rhythm (Scruton\n1997: 1\u201379; Hamilton 2007: 40\u201365; Kania 2011a). Another is\nan appeal to aesthetic properties or experience (Levinson 1990a;\nScruton 1997: 1\u201396; Hamilton 2007: 40\u201365). As these\nreferences suggest, one can endorse either of these conditions in\nisolation, or both together.\n\nThe main problem with the first kind of condition is that every sound\nseems capable of being included in a musical performance, and thus\ncharacterizing the essentially musical features of sounds seems\nhopeless. (We need only consider the variety of \u201cuntuned\u201d\npercussion available to a conservative symphonist, though we could\nalso consider examples of wind machines, typewriters, and toilets, in\nRalph Vaughan Williams\u2019s Sinfonia Antartica, Leroy\nAnderson\u2019s The Typewriter, and Yoko Ono\u2019s\n\u201cToilet Piece/Unknown.\u201d) Defenders of such a condition\nhave turned to sophisticated intentional or response-dependent\ntheories of tonality in order to overcome this problem. If the\nessentially musical features of a sound are not intrinsic to it, but\nsomehow related to how it is produced or perceived, we can classify\njust one of two \u201cindiscernible\u201d sounds as music.\n\nIf one endorses only an aesthetic condition, and not a tonality\ncondition, one still faces the problem of poetry\u2014non-musical\naesthetically organized sounds. Levinson, who takes this approach,\nexcludes organized linguistic sounds explicitly (1990a: 272). This\nraises the question of whether there are further distinctions to be\nmade between arts of sound. Andy Hamilton defends a tripartite\ndivision, arguing that sound art, as opposed to both music\nand literature, was established as a significant art form in the\ntwentieth century (2007: 40\u201365). This is one reason that\nHamilton endorses both tonal and aesthetic conditions on music;\nwithout the former, Levinson is unable to make such a distinction. On\nthe other hand, by endorsing an aesthetic condition, Hamilton is\nforced to exclude scales and Muzak, for instance, from the realm of\nmusic. Kania (2020: 296\u2013301) suggests that it is a mistake to\nthink that music is necessarily an art. He argues that we should\ndistinguish the medium of music from its artistic uses, just\nas we do in the cases of language and literature, depiction and\npainting, and so on.\n\nJonathan McKeown-Green (2014) makes trenchant criticisms of\ndefinitions of music that assume that the nature of music is\nsettled by our conception of music (395, italics removed). He\nargues that no such definition could be future-proof, since it\nwould be hostage to our changing conception of music. At best, we\nwould end up with a kind of sociological history of music that would\nfail to fulfill any of the functions of a definition. McKeown-Green\nsingles out the definitions of Kania (2011a) and Levinson (1990a),\nstated in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, as of this\nhopeless kind. But Kania (2020: 302\u20135) argues that\nMcKeown-Green\u2019s criticisms apply equally to the looser\ndefinitions of Hamilton and S. Davies (2012).\n\nHaving discussed complications, it\u2019s worth returning to the\nbasic idea of \u201corganized sound.\u201d Most theorists note that\nmusic does not consist entirely of sounds. Most obviously, much music\nincludes rests. You might think that silence can function only to\norganize the sounds of music. One counterargument is that an\nunderstanding listener listens to the rests, just as she\nlistens to the sounds (Kania 2010). Another is to provide putative\ncases of music in which the silences do not structure sounds as\nordinary rests do. John Cage\u2019s 4\u203233\u2033 is\nfrequently discussed, though there is broad agreement that this piece\nis not silent\u2014its content is the ambient sounds that occur\nduring its performance. (See Dodd 2018 for dissent.) Anyway, S. Davies\n(1997a), Dodd (2018), and Kania (2010) all argue that Cage\u2019s\npiece is not music\u2014Davies and Dodd because its sounds (if any)\nfail to qualify as organized, Kania because they fail to meet a\ntonality condition. Wadle (forthcoming) argues that the piece\nis music, because of its contextual connections to previous\nmusical works. Kania considers several other contenders for the label\nof \u201csilent music,\u201d arguing that there are indeed extant\nexamples, most notably Erwin Schulhoff\u2019s \u201cIn\nFuturum\u201d from his F\u00fcnf Pittoresken, which predates\nCage\u2019s 4\u203233\u2033 by some 33 years.\n",
