    "main_text": "\n\nThe argument and thought-experiment now generally known as the Chinese\nRoom Argument was first published in a 1980 article by American\nphilosopher John Searle (1932\u2013 ). It has become one of the best-known\narguments in recent philosophy. Searle imagines himself alone in a\nroom following a computer program for responding to Chinese characters\nslipped under the door. Searle understands nothing of Chinese, and\nyet, by following the program for manipulating symbols and numerals\njust as a computer does, he sends appropriate strings of Chinese\ncharacters back out under the door, and this leads those outside to\nmistakenly suppose there is a Chinese speaker in the room. \n\nThe narrow conclusion of the argument is that programming a digital\ncomputer may make it appear to understand language but could not\nproduce real understanding. Hence the \u201cTuring Test\u201d is\ninadequate. Searle argues that the thought experiment underscores the\nfact that computers merely use syntactic rules to manipulate symbol\nstrings, but have no understanding of meaning or semantics. The\nbroader conclusion of the argument is that the theory that human minds\nare computer-like computational or information processing systems is\nrefuted. Instead minds must result from biological processes;\ncomputers can at best simulate these biological processes. Thus the\nargument has large implications for semantics, philosophy of language\nand mind, theories of consciousness, computer science and cognitive\nscience generally. As a result, there have been many critical replies\nto the argument.\n",
