    "main_text": "The Offense Principle and Free Speech || Joel Feinberg's Offense Principle\n3.1 Joel Feinberg's Offense Principle\n\nThe other response to the harm principle is that it does not reach far\nenough. One of the most impressive arguments for this position comes\nfrom Joel Feinberg who suggests that the harm principle cannot\nshoulder all of the work necessary for a principle of free speech. In\nsome instances, Feinberg suggests, we also need an offense\nprinciple that can guide public censure. The basic idea is that\nthe harm principle sets the bar too high and that we can legitimately\nprohibit some forms of expression because they are very offensive.\nOffending is less serious than harming so any penalties imposed should\nnot be severe. As Feinberg notes, this has not always been the case\nand he cites a number of instances in the U.S. where penalties for\n\u201coffensive\u201d acts like sodomy and consensual incest have ranged from\ntwenty years imprisonment to the death penalty. Feinberg's principle\nreads as follows: \u201cit is always a good reason in support of a\nproposed criminal prohibition that it would probably be an effective\nway of preventing serious offense...to persons other than the actor,\nand that it is probably a necessary means to that end...The principle\nasserts, in effect, that the prevention of offensive conduct is\nproperly the state's business\u201d (1985, 1). \n\nSuch a principle is hard to apply because many people take offense as\nthe result of an overly sensitive disposition, or worse, because of\nbigotry and unjustified prejudice. A further difficulty is that some\npeople can be deeply offended by statements that others find mildly\namusing. The furore over the Danish cartoons brings this starkly to\nthe fore. Despite the difficulty of applying a standard of this kind,\nsomething like the offense principle operates widely in liberal\ndemocracies where citizens are penalized for a variety of activities,\nincluding speech, that would escape prosecution under the harm\nprinciple. Wandering around the local shopping mall naked, or engaging\nin sexual acts in public places are two obvious examples. Given the\nspecific nature of this essay, I will not delve into the issue of\noffensive behavior in all its manifestations, and I will limit the\ndiscussion to offensive forms of speech. Feinberg suggests that many\nfactors need to be taken into account when deciding whether speech can\nbe limited by the offense principle. These include the extent,\nduration and social value of the speech, the ease with which it can be\navoided, the motives of the speaker, the number of people offended,\nthe intensity of the offense, and the general interest of the\ncommunity.\n",
