    "main_text": "Six central methodological problems || Abstraction, idealization, and ceteris paribus clauses in economics\n2.4 Abstraction, idealization, and ceteris paribus clauses in economics\n\nEconomics raises questions concerning the legitimacy of severe\nabstraction and idealization. For example, mainstream economic models\noften stipulate that everyone is perfectly rational and has perfect\ninformation or that commodities are infinitely divisible. Such claims\nare exaggerations, and they are clearly false. Other schools of\neconomics may not employ idealizations that are this extreme, but\nthere is no way to do economics if one is not willing to simplify\ndrastically and abstract from many complications. How much\nsimplification, idealization, abstraction or \u201cisolation\u201d\n(M\u00e4ki 2006) is legitimate?\n\nIn addition, because economists attempt to study economic phenomena as\nconstituting a separate domain, influenced only by a small number of\ncausal factors, the claims of economics are true only ceteris\nparibus \u2014 that is, they are true only if there are no\ninterferences or disturbing causes. What are ceteris paribus\nclauses, and when if ever are they legitimate in science? Questions\nconcerning ceteris paribus clauses are closely related to\nquestions concerning simplifications and idealizations, since one way\nto simplify is to suppose that the various disturbing causes or\ninterferences are inactive and to explore the consequences of some\nsmall number of causal factors. These issues and the related question\nof how well supported economics is by the evidence have been\nthe central questions in economic methodology. They will be\ndiscussed further below mainly in\n Section 3.\n",
