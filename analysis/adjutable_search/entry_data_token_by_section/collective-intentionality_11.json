    "main_text": "Specific Issues || Collective Responsibility\n4.2 Collective Responsibility\n\nThe debates about collective responsibility began at least six decades\nago and by now constitute a distinct field of research in moral,\npolitical, and legal philosophy (cf. the entry on collective\nresponsibility). Accounts of collective intentionality, of joint\naction and group agency, can contribute to clarifying the conceptual,\naction-theoretic and ontological foundations of the phenomena in\nquestion (cf. May & Tuomela (eds.) 2007). Indeed, some influential\ncontributions to the study of social phenomena stem from debates about\ncollective responsibility and they proved to be important points of\nreference in discussions about collective intentionality (cf., e.g.,\nCopp 1979, 1980; French 1979, 1984; see also May & Hoffman (eds.)\n1991 and Barzagan-Forward & Tollefsen (eds.) 2020).\n\nThe closest systematic connection between these two fields regards the\npreconditions of (ascriptions of) responsibility. Assuming, more or\nless uncontroversially, that there is no responsibility without\nagency, intentionality, freedom, or autonomy on the part of the entity\nto whom responsibility is ascribed or who is held accountable, an\naccount of collective responsibility will have to include conceptions\nof collective agency, collective intentionality, collective freedom,\nand/or collective autonomy (see, e.g., Hindriks 2008b, Smiley 2018).\nIn analogy to the now widely accepted differentiations between joint\naction and group agency, one may also ask under what conditions a\nnumber of agents, who do not form or belong to an organized group, can\nbe jointly responsible for an action they performed jointly, for an\nevent they brought about through the joint action, or for events that\noccurred as a consequence of a joint omission (cf. Petersson\n2008).\n\nAs with the most discussed issues in the theory of collective\nintentionality, there is a fundamental divide between individualist\nand non-individualist (or collectivist) conceptions of collective\nresponsibility (cf. May 1992; Miller & Makela 2005; Miller 2006).\nThe former hold that only individual agents or natural persons can be\nproperly held responsible, while the latter hold that some collectives\ndo count as subjects of responsibility (cf. Mathiesen 2006; Pettit\n2007b; Hindriks 2009); depending on context and group size, there may\nbe a number of tenable intermediate positions on this spectrum. In any\ncase, it seems plausible to assume that one\u2019s account of\ncollective responsibility should not be starkly discontinuous with\none\u2019s account of collective agency. And it seems hardly\nspectacular to assume that a differentiated account of collective\nintentionality can inform a differentiated account of collective\nresponsibility. Systematically minded social philosophers are called\nupon to take up these challenges.\n",
