    "main_text": "Cognitive phenomenology || Phenomenal contrast cases\n5.1 Phenomenal contrast cases\n\nPhenomenal contrast cases are cases of two thoughts that are\nalike in sensory phenomenal character but differ in thought content.\n\n\nSiewert (1998) asks his readers to compare an experience of hearing or\nreading a sentence without understanding, as when one reads a\ndifficult passage without paying attention to it, and an experience of\nhearing or reading a sentence with understanding. There is\nclearly a phenomenal difference between these cases. Siewert argues\nthat the difference is not a difference in verbal or perceptual\nimagery, since the verbal and perceptual imagery might be the same in\nboth cases. The best explanation of the phenomenal contrast is that\nthought involves proprietary cognitive phenomenology. \n\nStrawson (1994) argues for a kind of \u201cunderstanding\nexperience\u201d by contrasting the cases of a monolingual English\nspeaker and a monolingual French speaker listening to the news in\nFrench. The experiences of the two subjects differ in a way that is\nnot fully explained by a difference in sensory phenomenology. The best\nexplanation involves a difference in cognitive phenomenology. Siewert\n(1998) also employs examples involving the comparison of hearing\nsentences in familiar versus unfamiliar languages. \n\nAs it stands, Strawson\u2019s argument can only establish that\nthought has a proprietary phenomenology, but Kriegel (2011a: 49)\nextends it to argue that thought has an individuative phenomenology.\nHe asks us to imagine a case of two languages involving graphically\nand phonetically identical words such that the same report can be\ninterpreted in one language as describing a faraway war and in the\nother language a children\u2019s bedtime story. Monolingual speakers\nof each language will experience different phenomenal characters upon\nreading or hearing this report. The best explanation of this involves\na difference in cognitive phenomenology. This supports the claim that\ncognitive phenomenology is individuative. \n\nOther arguments from phenomenal contrast cases aim to create the\ncontrasting experiences in the reader herself. Horgan and Tienson\n(2002) present the reader with sentences that are likely to give rise\nto two different interpretations, such as the following: \n\n\n(Relatives)\nVisiting relatives can be boring.\n\n\nOn one reading, the sentence is about the act of visiting relatives.\nOn another reading, the sentence is about relatives that visit. Both\nreadings are likely to generate the same verbal imagery, but they\ndiffer in content. Horgan and Tienson encourage the reader to notice\nthat they also differ in phenomenal character. If this is right, then\nthis suggests that thought has a proprietary and individuative\nphenomenology. \n\nThe following sentences are also used to generate phenomenal contrast\ncases:\n\n\n(Dogs)\nDogs dogs dog dog dogs. (Horgan and Tienson 2002)\n\n(Time)\n Time flies! (Horgan and Tienson 2002)\n\n(Bar)\nBefore she had a chance to pass the bar, she decided to change\ndirections, but she was not so pleasantly surprised with where she\nwound up. (Siewert 1998: 279)\n\n\n(Dogs)\n might at first be read without understanding, but might\nsubsequently be read with understanding, giving rise to a phenomenal\ncontrast case.\n (Time)\n can be read as a clich\u00e9 or as a command at the insect races.\n (Bar)\n can be read as being about an aborted legal career or a trip around\ntown. Again, the claim is that these different readings of the\nsentences give rise to different phenomenal experiences and that the\nbest explanation of this is that thought has a proprietary and\nindividuative phenomenology. \n\nThough instances of pairs of thoughts differing in intentional content\nand differing in phenomenal character provide some evidence for the\nexistence of individuative cognitive phenomenology, in order for the\nthesis that thought has a individuative phenomenology to be true,\nthere have to be no cases of thoughts that are alike in content but\nthat differ in phenomenal character. This latter kind of case would be a counterexample to (Individuative). Wilson (2003) responds to Horgan\nand Tienson by accepting their observations in their phenomenal\ncontrast cases but attempting to provide such a counterexample: \n\n\nIn the spirit of Horgan and Tienson\u2019s appeal for a reader to\n\u201cpay attention to your own experience\u201d ([2002] p. 521), I\nhave just done the decisive experiment: I thought first that George\nBush is President of the United States, and had CNN-mediated auditory\nand visual phenomenology that focussed on one of his speeches. I then\ntook a short break, doodled a little, wandered around the room, and\nthen had a thought with that very same content and \u2026 nothing.\nOr at least nothing distinctly Bush-like, as in the first case.\n(Wilson 2003: 417) \n\n\nIf Wilson is right, this not only shows that arguments based on\nphenomenal contrast ultimately fail, but also provides positive\nconsiderations against (Individuative), since it shows that there can\nbe thoughts with the same contents that fail to have the same\nphenomenal character. \n\nVersions of PIT that\n require only a one-many relation\n between phenomenal intentional content and phenomenal character, and\nhence that do not need to endorse (Individuative), can accommodate\nobservations such as Wilson\u2019s putative observation, since they\nallow that multiple phenomenal characters can ground or constitute the\nsame phenomenal intentional content. \n\nAnother kind of objection to arguments from phenomenal contrast involves agreeing\nthat there is a phenomenal difference between the relevant cases but\nclaiming that this difference is exhausted by sensory phenomenology,\nwhere this might include the phenomenology of perceptual imagery,\naffective experience, or verbal imagery (see, e.g., Lormand 1996, Tye\nand Wright 2011, Levine 2011, Robinson 2011, Carruthers and Veillet\n2011). What makes the phenomenal contrast cases described above\nvulnerable to this kind of objection is that they do not control for\nall potential accompanying perceptual imagery. This leaves open the\npossibility that the observed phenomenal differences are fully\naccounted for by such imagery. \n\nChudnoff (2013) provides a phenomenal contrast case that he claims\navoids this reply. He asks his readers to compare the experience of an\narray of dots to an experience of the same array of dots experienced\nas part of a proof for a mathematical theorem. In the second\nexperience, but not in the first, the perceptual experience involves\ncognitive phenomenology. The array of dots is in some sense\nexperienced as part of a larger whole, representative of something, or\nin some sense meaningful. (Chudnoff 2015a,b also contain extensive\ncritical discussions of phenomenal contrast cases.)\n\nOne might worry that, like the original phenomenal contrast cases,\nChudnoff\u2019s case does not control for certain forms of\naccompanying imagery, in this case, verbal imagery. The adamant\nopponent of cognitive phenomenology might insist that just as the\nphenomenal differences in the phenomenal contrast cases involving\nsentences might be explained by perceptual imagery, the differences in\nChudnoff\u2019s cases can be accounted for by differences in verbal\nphenomenology. \n\nIt might seem that what is needed is a phenomenal contrast case that\nplausibly controls for both verbal and perceptual phenomenology, as\nwell other kinds of sensory phenomenology. Mendelovici (2010: 107)\nargues that thoughts about chiliagons (one-thousand sided figures) and\nmegagons (one-million sided figures) might involve the same mental\nimagery (both shapes effectively look like circles) and so might\nprovide the basis for such cases. Imagine a person who mistakenly uses\nthe word \u201cmegagon\u201d to mean chilliagon. Compare\nher experience of viewing a chilliagon and thinking that it is a\nchilliagon with your experience of viewing a megagon and thinking that\nit is a megagon. Since you both use the word \u201cmegagon\u201d to\ndescribe the shape you are thinking about, and since the two\nshapes are perceptually similar, you will likely have the same\nperceptual and verbal imagery. If there is a phenomenal difference\nbetween the two cases, it is plausibly attributed to a difference in\nthought content.\n",
