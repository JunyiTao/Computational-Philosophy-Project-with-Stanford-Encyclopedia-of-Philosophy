V. O. Quine. Davidson\u2019s ideas, presented\nin a series of essays (and one posthumous monograph) from the 1960s\nonwards, have had an impact in a range of areas from semantic theory\nthrough to epistemology and ethics. His work exhibits a breadth of\napproach, as well as a unitary and systematic character, that is\nunusual within twentieth century analytic philosophy. Although he\nacknowledged an important debt to Quine, Davidson\u2019s thought\namalgamates influences from a wide range of sources within philosophy\nas well as outside. And whilst often developed separately,\nDavidson\u2019s ideas nevertheless combine in such a way as to\nprovide a single integrated approach to the problems of knowledge,\naction, language, and mind. The breadth and unity of his thought, in\ncombination with the sometimes terse character of his prose, means\nthat Davidson is not an easy writer to approach. Given the demanding\nnature of his work, it is perhaps only to be expected that it would\nreceive a range of interpretations and assessments, and this is\nespecially true of much of the engagement with Davidson\u2019s\nthought that has developed in the last 20 years or so. In several\npublications, Kirk Ludwig, for instance, has advanced readings of\nDavidson\u2019s philosophy, frequently in collaboration with Ernest\nLepore, that although partly exegetical also take issue with many of\nDavidson\u2019s claims and arguments (see e.g. Lepore and Ludwig\n2005; see also the exchange between Lepore and Ludwig and Stoutland in\nBaghramian, 2013). This reflects a more general tendency for\nDavidson\u2019s thinking to appear as a focus more often for critique\nthan elaboration. Despite Davidson\u2019s pre-eminence in analytic\nfigure during the 1970s and 1980s, his influence has waned over the\nlast decade or more and his work is now largely taken up, not in any\nsystematic fashion, but in relation to specific issues, especially of\nmind and action (although this also reflects more general shifts in\nthe configuration of current philosophical thought and practice\n\u2013 see Brandom, 2020: 260). Yet neither the various critiques\nthat have been advanced nor disciplinary shifts in philosophical\ndirection or approach should be taken to undermine the significance of\nDavidson\u2019s contribution, and his work has nonetheless continued\nto have an influence in the work of a range of thinkers. At the same\ntime, the re-publication of Davidson\u2019s essays, especially those\nfrom later in his career, has disseminated his ideas to a wider, and\nsometimes newly appreciative audience. In addition, Davidson\u2019s\nwork remains an important, if sometimes contentious, point of focus\nfor philosophical interaction between analytic and so-called\n\u2018continental\u2019 thought (see e.g. Malpas, 2011), and for\nreflection on the history and character of analytic thought as such\n(see, e.g, Isaac, 2013; Braver, 2017).\n", "toc": [{"#BiogSket": "1.

Biographical Sketch\n\nDavidson was born on March 6th, 1917, in Springfield, Massachusetts,\nUSA. He died suddenly, as a consequence of cardiac arrest following\nknee surgery, on Aug. 30, 2003, in Berkeley, California. Remaining\nboth physically and philosophically active up until his death,\nDavidson left behind several important and unfinished projects\nincluding a major book on the nature of predication. The latter volume\nwas published posthumously (see Davidson 2005b), together with two\nadditional volumes of collected essays (Davidson 2004, 2005a), under\nthe guidance of Marcia Cavell.\n\nDavidson completed his undergraduate study at Harvard, graduating in\n1939. His early interests were in literature and classics and, as an\nundergraduate, Davidson was strongly influenced by A. N. Whitehead.\nAfter starting graduate work in classical philosophy (completing a\nMaster\u2019s degree in 1941), Davidson\u2019s studies were\ninterrupted by service with the US Navy in the Mediterranean from\n1942\u201345. He continued work in classical philosophy after the\nwar, graduating from Harvard in 1949 with a dissertation on\nPlato\u2019s \u2018Philebus\u2019 (1990b). By this time, however,\nthe direction of Davidson\u2019s thinking had already, under\nQuine\u2019s influence, changed quite dramatically (the two having\nfirst met at Harvard in 1939\u201340) and he had begun to move away\nfrom the largely literary and historical concerns that had preoccupied\nhim as an undergraduate towards a more strongly analytical\napproach.\n\nWhile his first position was at Queen\u2019s College in New York,\nDavidson spent much of the early part of his career (1951\u20131967)\nat Stanford University. He subsequently held positions at Princeton\n(1967\u20131970), Rockefeller (1970\u20131976), and the University\nof Chicago (1976\u20131981). From 1981 until his death, he worked at\nthe University of California, Berkeley. Davidson was the recipient of\nseveral awards and fellowships and was a visitor at many universities\naround the world. He was married three times, to the artist Virginia\nDavidson, from whom he was divorced but with whom he had his only\nchild, then to the psychologist Nancy Hirschberg, who died in 1979,\nand finally, in 1984, to Marcia Cavell. Davidson\u2019s posthumously\npublished essays are edited by Cavell, and she was also an important\ninfluence on Davidson as well as drawing on Davidson\u2019s thinking\nin her own work (see esp. Cavell 1993). For more on Davidson\u2019s\nbiography, including reminiscences from those who knew him, see\nBaghramian 2013. The Donald Davidson papers, which include course\nnotes, professional correspondence, administrative materials, and\nacademic writings, are held in the Bancroft Library at the University\nof California, Berkeley. In the late 1990s, under the auspices of the\nCentre for Philosophy of the Natural and Social Sciences, at the\nLondon School of Economics, Davidson participated in a series of\nrecorded one-on-one conversations with many of the leading figures in\nphilosophy at the time \u2013 including, among others, Quine, Nancy\nCartwright, Richard Rorty, Peter Strawson, and Michael Dummett\n(Davidson, 1997). These recordings, now available online and\nelsewhere, provide valuable additional insight into both the style and\ncontent of Davidson\u2019s thought.\n2. Action and Mind\n2.1 Reasons as Causes\n\nMuch of Davidson\u2019s early work was in decision theory (see\nDecision-Making: An Experimental Approach [1957]), and it was\nnot until the early 1960s that the work for which he is best known\nbegan to appear in print. Indeed, Davidson\u2019s first major\nphilosophical publication was the seminal paper \u2018Actions,\nReasons and Causes\u2019 (1963). In that paper Davidson sets out to\ndefend the view that the explanation of action by reference to reasons\n(something we do, for instance, when we refer to an agent\u2019s\nintentions or motives in acting) is also a form of causal explanation.\nIndeed, he argues that reasons explain actions just inasmuch as they\nare the causes of those actions. This approach was in clear opposition\nto the Wittgensteinian orthodoxy of the time. On this latter account\ncausal explanation was viewed as essentially a matter of showing the\nevent to be explained as an instance of some law-like regularity (as\nwe might explain the whistling of a kettle by reference to certain\nlaws involving, among other things, the behaviour of gases under\npressure). Since rational explanation was held, in general, not to\ninvolve any such reference to laws, but rather required showing how\nthe action fitted into some larger pattern of rational behaviour,\nexplanation by reference to reasons was held to be distinct from and\nindependent of explanation by reference to causes.\n\nAlthough directed against the Wittgensteinian-inspired view that\nreasons cannot be causes, Davidson\u2019s argument nevertheless\neffectively redeploys several Wittgensteinian ideas (see Stoutland, in\nMalpas 2011: 297\u2013324, for a sympathetic, but not uncritical,\nexamination of the Davidsonian view of action from a largely\nWittgensteinian perspective). Two ideas play an especially significant\nrole in the Davidsonian account \u2013 ideas that are also, in one\nform or another, important in Davidson\u2019s thinking elsewhere. The\nfirst of these ideas is the notion of a \u2018primary reason\u2019\n\u2013 the pairing of a belief and a desire (or\n\u2018pro-attitude\u2019) in the light of which an action is\nexplained. Thus, my action of flipping the light switch can be\nexplained by reference to my having the belief that flipping\nthe switch turns on the light in combination with my having the\ndesire to turn on the light (for most explanations explicit\nreference to both the belief and the desire is unnecessary). An action\nis thereby rendered intelligible through being embedded in a broader\nsystem of attitudes attributable to the agent \u2013 through being\nembedded, that is, in a broader framework of rationality. The\nsecond idea is that of action \u2018under a description\u2019 (a\nphrase originally appearing in G. E. M. Anscombe\u2019s\nIntention, published in 1959). As with the concept of a\nprimary reason, the idea here is simple enough: one and the same\naction is always amenable to more than one correct description. This\nidea is especially important, however, as it provides a means by which\nthe same item of behaviour can be understood as intentional under some\ndescriptions but not under others. Thus, my action of flipping the\nlight switch can be redescribed as the act of turning on the light\n(under which it is intentional) and also as the act of alerting the\nprowler who, unbeknown to me, is lurking in the bushes outside (under\nwhich it is unintentional). Generalising this point, we can say that\nthe same event can be referred to under quite disparate descriptions:\nthe event of alerting the prowler is the same event as my flipping the\nlight switch which is the same event as my moving of my body (or a\npart of my body) in a certain way.\n\nDavidson treats the connection between reason and action (where the\nreason is indeed the reason for the action) as a connection\nthat obtains between two events (the agent\u2019s believing and\ndesiring on the one hand and her acting on the other) that can be\nvariously described. The connection is both rational, inasmuch as the\nbelief-desire pair (the \u2018primary reason\u2019) specifies the\nreason for the action, but it is also causal, inasmuch as the one\nevent causes the other if it is indeed the reason for it. It is\nprecisely because the reason is causally related to the action that\nthe action can be explained by reference to the reason. Indeed, where\nan agent has several reasons for acting, and yet acts on the basis of\none reason in particular, there is no way to pick out just that reason\non which the agent acts other than by saying that it is the reason\nthat caused her action.\n\nUnderstood as rational, the connection between reason and action\ncannot be described in terms of any strict law. Yet inasmuch as the\nconnection is also a causal connection, so there must exist some\nlaw-like regularity, though not describable in the language of\nrationality, under which the events in question fall (an explanation\ncan be causal, then, even though it does not specify any strict law).\nDavidson is thus able to maintain that rational explanation need not\ninvolve explicit reference to any law-like regularity, while\nnevertheless also holding that there must be some such regularity that\nunderlies the rational connection just inasmuch as it is causal.\nMoreover, since Davidson resists the idea that rational explanations\ncan be formulated in the terms of a predictive science, so he seems\ncommitted to denying that there can be any reduction of rational to\nnon-rational explanation.\n2.2 The Anomalism of the Mental\n\nThe more developed argument for this latter claim, and for the more\ngeneral position in the philosophy of mind, of which it forms a part,\nappears at several places in Davidson\u2019s work. The first and\nbest-known presentation is that of \u2018Mental Events\u2019 (1970b)\nin which Davidson argues for the compatibility of three principles\n(all three of which are adumbrated in various ways in the argument of\n\u2018Actions, Reasons and Causes\u2019): (i) that at least some\nmental events interact causally with physical events \u2013 The\nPrinciple of Causal Interaction; (ii) that events related as\ncause and effect fall under strict laws (that is, laws that are\n\u2018precise, explicit and as exceptionless as possible\u2019)\n\u2013 The Principle of the Nomological Character of\nCausality; and (iii) that there are no strict laws (as opposed to\nmere generalisations) relating mental and physical events \u2013\nThe Anomalism of the Mental. Of these principles the first\ntwo would ordinarily be held to be incompatible with the third, and to\nimply, not the \u2018anomalism\u2019 of the mental, but rather, in\nthe case of mental and physical events related as cause and effect,\nthe existence of strict laws relating those events. To argue, as does\nDavidson, for the compatibility of the original principles is thus\nalso to argue for the truth of the third, that is, for the truth of\nanomalous monism.\n\nDavidson holds that events are particulars such that the same event\ncan be referred to under more than one description. He also holds that\nevents that are causally related must be related under some strict\nlaw. However, since Davidson takes laws to be linguistic entities, so\nthey can relate events only as those events are given under specific\ndescriptions. Thus, as was already evident in Davidson\u2019s\napproach to the theory of action, the same pair of events may\ninstantiate a law under one description, but not under others. There\nis, for example, no strict law that relates, under just those\ndescriptions, the formation of ice on the surface of a road to the\nskidding of a car on that road, and yet, under a different description\n(a description that will employ a completely different set of\nconcepts), the events at issue will indeed be covered by some strict\nlaw or set of laws. But while nomological relations between events\n(relations involving laws) depend on the descriptions under which the\nevents are given, relations of causality and identity obtain\nirrespective of descriptions \u2013 if the icing-up of the road did\nindeed cause the skid, then it did so no matter how the events at\nissue are described (the form of description, whether mental or\nphysical, is thus irrelevant to the fact that a particular causal\nrelation obtains). It follows that the same pair of events may be\nrelated causally, and yet, under certain descriptions (though not\nunder all), there be no strict law under which those events fall. In\nparticular, it is possible that a mental event (an event given under\nsome mental description) will be causally related to some physical\nevent (an event given under a physical description) and yet there will\nbe no strict law covering those events under just those\ndescriptions. My wanting to read Tolstoy may lead me to take\nWar and Peace from the shelf, and so my wanting may cause a\nchange in the physical arrangement of a certain region of space-time,\nbut there is no strict law that would relate my wanting to the\nphysical change. Similarly, while any mental event will be identical\nwith some physical event \u2013 it will indeed be one and the same\nevent under two descriptions \u2013 it is possible that there will be\nno strict law relating the event as described in mentalistic terms\nwith the event as physically described. In fact, Davidson is explicit\nin claiming that there can be no strict laws that relate the\nmental and the physical in this way. Thus, in the example just cited,\nthere is no strict law that relates wanting to read with a particular\nkind of brain activity.\n\nDavidson\u2019s denial of the existence of any strict\n\u2018psycho-physical\u2019 laws follows from his view of the mental\nas constrained by quite general principles of rationality that do not\napply, at least not in the same way, to physical descriptions:\nnormative considerations of overall consistency and coherence, for\ninstance, constrain our own thinking about events as physically\ndescribed, but they have no purchase on physical events as such. This\ndoes not mean, of course, that there are no correlations whatsoever to\nbe discerned between the mental and the physical, but it does mean\nthat the correlations that can be discerned cannot be rendered in the\nprecise, explicit and exceptionless form \u2013 in the form, that is,\nof strict laws \u2013 that would be required in order to achieve any\nreduction of mental to physical descriptions. The lack of strict laws\ncovering events under mental descriptions is thus an insuperable\nbarrier to any attempt to bring the mental within the framework of\nunified physical science. However, while the mental is not reducible\nto the physical, every mental event can be paired with some physical\nevent \u2013 that is, every mental description of an event can be\npaired with a physical description of the very same event. This leads\nDavidson to speak of the mental as \u2018supervening\u2019 on the\nphysical in a way that implies a certain dependence of mental\npredicates on physical predicates: predicate p supervenes on\na set of predicates S \u2018if and only if p does\nnot distinguish any entities that cannot be distinguished by\nS\u2019 (see \u2018Thinking Causes\u2019 [1993]). Put more\nsimply, events that cannot be distinguished under some physical\ndescription cannot be distinguished under a mental description\neither.\n\nOn the face of it, anomalous monism appears a highly attractive way to\nthink about the relation between the mental and the physical \u2013\ninasmuch as it combines \u2018monism\u2019 with\n\u2018anomalism\u2019 so it seems to preserve what is important\nabout physicalism while nevertheless retaining the ordinary language\nof so-called \u2018folk-psychology\u2019 (the language of beliefs\nand desires, actions and reasons). Yet anomalous monism has proved to\nbe a highly contentious position drawing criticism from both\nphysicalists and non-physicalists alike. The nomological conception of\ncausality (the second of the three principles defended in\n\u2018Mental Events\u2019) has often been seen as something for\nwhich Davidson fails to supply any real argument (a criticism he has\nattempted to address in \u2018Laws and Cause\u2019 [1995]); the\nDavidsonian account of supervenience has been viewed as incompatible\nwith other aspects of his position and sometimes as simply mistaken or\nconfused (the idea of supervenience is itself the focus for what is\nnow a very large body of discussion); and, perhaps the most serious\nand widespread criticism, anomalous monism has been seen as making the\nmental causally inert. These criticisms have not, however, gone\nunanswered (see especially \u2018Thinking Causes\u2019), and\nalthough Davidson modified aspects of his position over the years, he\ncontinued to hold to, and to defend, the basic theses first made\nexplicit in \u2018Mental Events\u2019.\n2.3 Problems of Irrationality\n\nDavidson\u2019s commitment to the rationality of the mental as one of\nthe cornerstones of anomalous monism (as well as to the account of\n\u2018radical interpretation\u2019 [see \u2018Meaning and\nTruth\u2019 below]) led him to take a special interest in the problem\nof apparently irrational belief and action \u2013 something first\naddressed in \u2018How is Weakness of the Will\nPossible?\u2019(1970a). While Davidson treats irrationality as a real\nfeature of our mental lives, he offers a way of dealing with it that\naims at preserving, in some sense, the overall rationality of the mind\n(see especially \u2018Two Paradoxes of Irrationality\u2019 [1982b]).\nA belief or desire in the mind of one person can cause a belief or\ndesire in the mind of another without this compromising the\nrationality of the mental. (Davidson\u2019s example is my growing of\na beautiful flower because I desire you to enter my garden \u2013 you\ndevelop a craving to see the flower as a result of my desire and my\ndesire has thereby caused, without being a reason for, your craving).\nDavidson suggests that we should view the same sort of relation as\nsometimes holding within a single mind. To this end we should view the\nmind as weakly \u2018partitioned\u2019 so that different attitudes\nmay be located within different \u2018territories\u2019 and need\nnot, therefore, be taken to come into direct conflict.\n\nDavidson\u2019s thinking about irrationality was increasingly\ninfluenced by an engagement with psychoanalytic thinking. Marcia\nCavell had strong psychoanalytic interests, and in The\nPsychoanalytic Mind (Cavell 1993), she connects Davidson\u2019s\nthought directly with that of Freud.\n2.4 Ontology and Logical Form\n\nDavidson\u2019s accounts of action and of mind call upon a\nwell-developed set of analyses concerning psychological concepts such\nas belief, desire and intention \u2013 concepts whose analysis is\ntaken further in a number of papers that follow on from, and develop\nor modify, the ideas first set out in \u2018Actions, Reasons and\nCauses\u2019 (papers such as \u2018Agency\u2019 (1971) and\n\u2018Intending\u2019 [1978a]) as well as in Davidson\u2019s\ndiscussions of epistemological and semantic issues (see below). But\nDavidson \u2018s work in this area is also dependent on his account\nof the notions of cause, event, and law and, in particular, on his\ndefence of the view that events are particulars and so constitute a\nfundamental ontological category. If events are indeed particulars,\nthen an important question concerns the conditions of identity for\nevents. In \u2018The Individuation of Events\u2019 [1969a] Davidson\nargues that events are identical if and only if they have identical\ncauses and effects. In \u2018Reply to Quine on Events\u2019 [1985b]\nhe abandons this criterion in favour of the Quinean suggestion that\nevents are identical if and only if they occupy exactly the same\nlocation in space and time.\n\nA characteristic feature of Davidson\u2019s approach to such\nontological questions has been to focus on the logical structure of\nsentences about the entities at issue rather than on those entities as\nsuch. Davidson\u2019s approach to events, for instance, is grounded\nin an analysis of the underlying logical form of sentences about\nevents; in the case of causal relations, in an analysis of the logical\nform of sentences that express such relations (see \u2018Causal\nRelations\u2019 [1967a]); and in his approach to action also,\nDavidson\u2019s approach involves an analysis of the logical form of\nsentences about actions (see \u2018The Logical Form of Action\nSentences\u2019 [1967b]). This reflects a more general commitment on\nDavidson\u2019s part to the inseparability of questions of ontology\nfrom questions of logic. This commitment is spelt out explicitly in\n\u2018The Method of Truth in Metaphysics\u2019 (1977) and it\nprovides a further point of connection between Davidson\u2019s work\nin the philosophy of action, event and mind and his work on questions\nof meaning and language.\n3. Meaning and Truth\n3.1 The Structure of a Semantic Theory\n\nAlthough Davidson wrote on a wide range of topics, a great deal of his\nwork, particularly during the late 1960s and early 1970s, is focussed\non the problem of developing an approach to the theory of meaning that\nwould be adequate to natural language. The characteristic feature of\nDavidson\u2019s approach to this problem is his proposal that meaning\nis best understood via the concept of truth, and, more particularly,\nthat the basic structure for any adequate theory of meaning is that\ngiven in a formal theory of truth.\n\nDavidson\u2019s thinking about semantic theory develops on the basis\nof a holistic conception of linguistic understanding (see \u2018Truth\nand Meaning\u2019 [1967c]). Providing a theory of meaning for a\nlanguage is thus a matter of developing a theory that will enable us\nto generate, for every actual and potential sentence of the language\nin question, a theorem that specifies what each sentence means. On\nthis basis a theory of meaning for German that was given in English\nmight be expected to generate theorems that would explicate the German\nsentence \u2018Schnee ist weiss\u2019 as meaning that snow is white.\nSince the number of potential sentences in any natural language is\ninfinite, a theory of meaning for a language that is to be of use to\ncreatures with finite powers such as ourselves, must be a theory that\ncan generate an infinity of theorems (one for each sentence) on the\nbasis of a finite set of axioms. Indeed, any language that is to be\nlearnable by creatures such as ourselves must possess a structure that\nis amenable to such an approach. Consequently, the commitment to\nholism also entails a commitment to a compositional\napproach according to which the meanings of sentences are seen to\ndepend upon the meanings of their parts, that is, upon the meanings of\nthe words that form the finite base of the language and out of which\nsentences are composed. Compositionality does not compromise holism,\nsince not only does it follow from it, but, on the Davidsonian\napproach, it is only as they play a role in whole sentences that\nindividual words can be viewed as meaningful. It is sentences, and not\nwords, that are thus the primary focus for a Davidsonian theory of\nmeaning. Developing a theory for a language is a matter of developing\na systematic account of the finite structure of the language that\nenables the user of the theory to understand any and every sentence of\nthe language.\n\nA Davidsonian theory of meaning explicates the meanings of expressions\nholistically through the interconnection that obtains among\nexpressions within the structure of the language as a whole.\nConsequently, although it is indeed a theory of meaning, a\ntheory of the sort Davidson proposes will have no use for a concept of\nmeaning understood as some discrete entity (whether a determinate\nmental state or an abstract \u2018idea\u2019) to which meaningful\nexpressions refer. One important implication of this is that the\ntheorems that are generated by such a theory of meaning cannot be\nunderstood as theorems that relate expressions and\n\u2018meanings\u2019. Instead such theorems will relate sentences to\nother sentences. More particularly, they will relate sentences in the\nlanguage to which the theory applies (the\n\u2018object-language\u2019) to sentences in the language in which\nthe theory of meaning is itself couched (the\n\u2018meta-language\u2019) in such a way that the latter effectively\n\u2018give the meanings of\u2019 or translate the former. It might\nbe thought that the way to arrive at theorems of this sort is to take\nas the general form of such theorems \u2018s means that\np\u2019 where s names an object-language sentence\nand p is a sentence in the meta-language. But this would be\nalready to assume that we could give a formal account of the\nconnecting phrase \u2018means that\u2019, and not only does this\nseem unlikely, but it also appears to assume a concept of meaning when\nit is precisely that concept (at least as it applies within a\nparticular language) that the theory aims to elucidate. It is at this\npoint that Davidson turns to the concept of truth. Truth, he argues,\nis a less opaque concept than that of meaning. Moreover, to specify\nthe conditions under which a sentence is true is also a way of\nspecifying the meaning of a sentence. Thus, rather than\n\u2018s means that p\u2019, Davidson proposes, as\nthe model for theorems of an adequate theory of meaning,\n\u2018s is true if and only if p\u2019 (the use of\nthe biconditional \u2018if and only if\u2019 is crucial here as it\nensures the truth-functional equivalence of the sentences s\nand p, that is, it ensures they will have identical\ntruth-values). The theorems of a Davidsonian theory of meaning for\nGerman couched in English would thus take the form of sentences such\nas \u201c\u2018Schnee ist weiss\u2019 is true if and only if snow\nis white.\u201d\n3.2 Tarski and \u2018Convention T\u2019\n\nOne of the great advantages of this proposal is that it enables\nDavidson to connect his account of a theory of meaning with an already\nexisting approach to the theory of truth, namely that developed by\nAlfred Tarski (in his seminal work \u2018The Concept of Truth in\nFormalised Languages\u2019, first published in Polish in 1933 and in\nEnglish translation in 1956). Tarski\u2019s theory of truth was\noriginally intended, not as a general account of the nature of truth,\nbut rather as a way of defining the truth-predicate as it applies\nwithin a formal language. Tarski suggests that we arrive at a formal\ndefinition of the predicate \u2018is true\u2019 by providing, for\nevery sentence s in the object language, a matching sentence\np in the meta-language that is a translation of s\n(here, in his use of the idea of translational synonymy, Tarski relies\nupon the concept of meaning in order to get at a theory of truth\n\u2013 Davidson reverses this approach). The resulting\n\u2018T-sentences\u2019 will have the form \u2018s is true\nin language L if and only if p\u2019. That an\nadequate theory should indeed be capable of generating a T-sentence\nfor every sentence in the object-language is the essence of\nTarski\u2019s \u2018Convention T\u2019 \u2013 a requirement that\nclearly matches the holistic requirement Davidson also specifies for\nan adequate theory of meaning. And just as a Davidsonian theory of\nmeaning treats the meaning of whole sentences as dependent on the\ncomponents of those sentences, so a Tarskian theory of truth also\noperates recursively by means of the technical notion of\nsatisfaction \u2013 a notion that stands to open sentences\n(expressions containing unbound variables) as does truth to closed\nsentences (expressions that contain no variables other than bound\nvariables) \u2013 such that the satisfaction conditions of more\ncomplex sentences are seen to depend on the satisfaction conditions of\nsimpler sentences.\n\nThe formal structure that Tarski articulates in his\n\u2018semantic\u2019 account of truth is identical to that which\nDavidson explicates as the basis for a theory of meaning: a Tarskian\ntruth theory can generate, for every sentence of the object-language,\na T-sentence that specifies the meaning of each sentence in the sense\nof specifying the conditions under which it is true. What\nDavidson\u2019s work shows, then, is that meeting the requirement of\nTarski\u2019s Convention T can be seen as the basic requirement for\nan adequate theory of meaning.\n\nA Tarskian truth theory defines truth using a logical apparatus that\nrequires little more than the resources provided within first-order\nquantificational logic as supplemented by set theory. Moreover, it\nalso operates to deliver a definition of truth that is purely\n\u2018extensional\u2019, that is, it defines truth by specifying\njust those instances to which the truth-predicate properly applies\nwithout any reference to \u2018meanings\u2019,\n\u2018thoughts\u2019 or other \u2018intensional\u2019 entities.\nBoth these features represent important advantages for the Davidsonian\napproach (Davidson\u2019s rejection of determinate meanings as having\na significant role to play in a theory of meaning already involves a\ncommitment to an extensional approach to language). However, these\nfeatures also present certain problems. Davidson wishes to apply the\nTarskian model as the basis for a theory of meaning for natural\nlanguages, but such languages are far richer than the well-defined\nformal systems to which Tarski had directed his attention. In\nparticular natural languages contain features that seem to require\nresources beyond those of first-order logic or of any purely\nextensional analysis. Examples of such features include indirect or\nreported speech (\u2018Galileo said that the earth moves\u2019),\nadverbial expressions (\u2018Flora swam slowly\u2019 where\n\u2018slowly\u2019 modifies \u2018Flora swam\u2019) and\nnon-indicative sentences such as imperatives (\u2018Eat your\neggplant!\u2019). An important part of Davidson\u2019s work in the\nphilosophy of language has been to show how such apparently\nrecalcitrant features of natural language can indeed be analysed so as\nto make them amenable to a Tarskian treatment. In \u2018On Saying\nThat\u2019 (1968) and \u2018Quotation\u2019 (1979b) he addresses\nthe question of indirect speech; in \u2018Moods and\nPerformances\u2019 (1979a) he deals with non-indicative utterances;\nand in \u2018Adverbs of Action\u2019 (1985a) he takes up the problem\nof adverbial modification. As in Davidson\u2019s analysis of actions\nand events, the notion of logical form plays an important part in his\napproach here \u2013 the problem of how to apply a Tarskian truth\ntheory to natural language is shown to depend on providing an analysis\nof the underlying logical form of natural language expressions which\nrenders them in such a way that they fall under the scope of a purely\nextensional approach employing only minimal logical resources.\n\nThere is, however, another more general problem that affects\nDavidson\u2019s appropriation of Tarski. Whilst Tarski uses the\nnotion of sameness of meaning, through the notion of translation, as\nthe means to provide a definition of truth (one of the requirements of\nConvention T is that the sentence on the right-hand side of a Tarskian\nT-sentence be a translation of the sentence on the left), Davidson\naims to use truth to provide an account of meaning. But in that case,\nit seems that Davidson needs some other way to constrain the formation\nof T-sentences so as to ensure that they do indeed deliver correct\nspecifications of what sentences mean. This problem is readily\nillustrated by the question of how we are to rule out T-sentences of\nthe form \u201c\u2018Schnee ist weiss\u2019 is true if and only if\ngrass is green.\u201d Since the biconditional \u2018if and only\nif\u2019 ensures only that the sentence named on the left will have\nthe same truth value as the sentence on the right, so it would seem to\nallow us to make any substitution of sentences on the right so long as\ntheir truth value is identical to that on the left. In one respect\nthis problem is met by simply insisting on the way in which\nT-sentences must be seen as theorems generated by a theory of meaning\nthat is adequate to the language in question as a whole (see\n\u2018Truth and Meaning\u2019). Since the meaning of particular\nexpressions will not be independent of the meaning of other\nexpressions (in virtue of the commitment to compositionality the\nmeanings of all sentences must be generated on the same finite base),\nso a theory that generates problematic results in respect of one\nexpression can be expected to generate problematic results elsewhere,\nand, in particular, to also generate results that do not meet the\nrequirements of Convention T. This problem can also be seen, however,\nas closely related to another important point of difference between a\nTarskian truth theory and a Davidsonian theory of meaning: a theory of\nmeaning for a natural language must be an empirical theory (it is,\nindeed, a theory that ought to apply to actual linguistic behaviour)\nand as such it ought to be empirically verifiable. Satisfaction of the\nrequirement that a theory of meaning be adequate as an empirical\ntheory, and so that it be adequate to the actual behaviour of\nspeakers, will also ensure tighter constraints, if such are needed, on\nthe formation of T-sentences. Indeed, Davidson is not only quite\nexplicit in emphasising the empirical character of a theory of\nmeaning, but he also offers a detailed account that both explains how\nsuch a theory might be developed and specifies the nature of the\nevidence on which it must be based.\n3.3 Radical Interpretation\n\nDavidson\u2019s strategy is to embed the formal structure for a\ntheory of meaning (the structure he finds in a Tarskian truth theory)\nwithin a more general theory of interpretation the broad outlines of\nwhich he draws from Quine\u2019s discussion in Word and\nObject (first published in 1960). \u2018Radical\ntranslation\u2019 is intended by Quine as an idealisation of the\nproject of translation that will exhibit that project in its purest\nform. Normally the task of the translator is aided by prior linguistic\nknowledge \u2013 either of the actual language to be translated or of\nsome related language. Quine envisages a case in which translation of\na language must proceed without any prior linguistic knowledge and\nsolely on the basis of the observed behaviour of the speakers of the\nlanguage in conjunction with observation of the basic perceptual\nstimulations that give rise to that behaviour. Davidson has a broader\nconception of the behavioural evidence available than does Quine (he\nallows that we may, for instance, identify speakers as having the\nattitude of \u2018holding true\u2019 with respect to sentences) and,\nin addition, rejects the Quinean insistence on a special role being\ngiven to simple perceptual stimulations. Moreover, since\nDavidson\u2019s interest is more properly semantic than Quine\u2019s\n(Quine sees radical translation as part of a primarily epistemological\ninquiry), while Davidson also views a theory of translation alone as\ninsufficient to ensure understanding of the language it translates\n(the translation may be into a language we do not understand), so the\nnotion of \u2018translation\u2019 is replaced in the Davidsonian\naccount with that of \u2018interpretation\u2019. Radical\ninterpretation is a matter of interpreting the linguistic\nbehaviour of a speaker \u2018from scratch\u2019 and so without\nreliance on any prior knowledge either of the speaker\u2019s beliefs\nor the meanings of the speaker\u2019s utterances. It is intended to\nlay bare the knowledge that is required if linguistic understanding is\nto be possible, but it involves no claims about the possible\ninstantiation of that knowledge in the minds of interpreters (Davidson\nthus makes no commitments about the underlying psychological reality\nof the knowledge that a theory of interpretation makes explicit).\n\nThe basic problem that radical interpretation must address is that one\ncannot assign meanings to a speaker\u2019s utterances without knowing\nwhat the speaker believes, while one cannot identify beliefs without\nknowing what the speaker\u2019s utterances mean. It seems that we\nmust provide both a theory of belief and a theory of meaning at one\nand the same time. Davidson claims that the way to achieve this is\nthrough the application of the so-called \u2018principle of\ncharity\u2019 (he refers to it briefly elsewhere as the principle of\n\u2018rational accommodation\u2019), a version of which is also to\nbe found in Quine. In Davidson\u2019s work this principle, which\nadmits of various formulations and cannot be rendered in any\ncompletely precise form, often appears in terms of the injunction to\noptimise agreement between ourselves and those we interpret, that is,\nit counsels us to interpret speakers as holding true beliefs (true by\nour lights at least) wherever it is plausible to do (see\n\u2018Radical Interpretation\u2019 [1973]). In fact the principle\ncan be seen as combining two notions: a holistic assumption of\nrationality in belief (\u2018coherence\u2019) and an assumption of\ncausal relatedness between beliefs, especially perceptual beliefs, and\nthe objects of belief (\u2018correspondence\u2019) (see \u2018Three\nVarieties of Knowledge\u2019 [1991]). The process of interpretation\nturns out to depend on both aspects of the principle. Attributions of\nbelief and assignments of meaning must be consistent with one another\nand with the speaker\u2019s overall behaviour; they must also be\nconsistent with the evidence afforded by our knowledge of the\nspeaker\u2019s environment, since it is the worldly causes of beliefs\nthat must, in the \u2018most basic cases\u2019, be taken to be the\nobjects of belief (see \u2018A Coherence Theory of Truth and\nKnowledge\u2019 [1983]). Inasmuch as charity is taken to generate\nparticular attributions of belief, so those attributions are, of\ncourse, always defeasible. The principle itself is not so, however,\nsince it remains, on the Davidsonian account, a presupposition of any\ninterpretation whatsoever. Charity is, in this respect, both a\nconstraint and an enabling principle in all interpretation. It is more\nthan just a heuristic device to be employed in the opening stages of\ninterpretative engagement.\n\nIf we assume that the speaker\u2019s beliefs, at least in the\nsimplest and most basic cases, are largely in agreement with our own,\nand so, by our account, are largely true, then we can use our own\nbeliefs about the world as a guide to the speaker\u2019s beliefs.\nAnd, provided that we can identify simple assertoric utterances on the\npart of a speaker (that is, provided we can identify the attitude of\nholding true), then the interconnection between belief and meaning\nenables us to use our beliefs as a guide to the\nmeanings of the speaker\u2019s utterances, thereby providing\nthe basis for both a rudimentary theory of belief and a rudimentary\naccount of meaning. So, for example, when the speaker with whom we are\nengaged uses a certain sequence of sounds repeatedly in the presence\nof what we believe to be a rabbit, we can, as a preliminary\nhypothesis, interpret those sounds as utterances about rabbits or\nabout some particular rabbit. Once we have arrived at a preliminary\nassignment of meanings for a significant body of utterances, we can\ntest our assignments against further linguistic behaviour on the part\nof the speaker, modifying those assignments in accordance with the\nresults. Using our developing theory of meaning we are then able to\ntest the initial attributions of belief that were generated through\nthe application of charity, and, where necessary, modify those\nattributions also. This enables us, in turn, to further adjust our\nassignments of meaning, which enables further adjustment in the\nattribution of beliefs, \u2026 and so the process continues until\nsome sort of equilibrium is reached. The development of a more finely\ntuned theory of belief thus allows us to better adjust our theory of\nmeaning, while the adjustment of our theory of meaning in turn enables\nus to better tune our theory of belief. Through balancing attributions\nof belief against assignments of meaning, we are able to move towards\nan overall theory of behaviour for a speaker or speakers that combines\nboth a theory of meaning and of belief within a single theory of\ninterpretation.\n3.4 Holism and Indeterminacy\n\nSince it is indeed a single, combined theory that is the aim here, so\nthe adequacy of any such theory must be measured in terms of the\nextent to which the theory does indeed provide a unified view of the\ntotality of behavioural evidence available to us (taken in conjunction\nwith our own beliefs about the world) rather than by reference to any\nsingle item of behaviour. This can be viewed as a more general version\nof the same requirement, made in relation to a formal theory of\nmeaning, that a theory of meaning for a language address the totality\nof utterances for that language, although, in the context of radical\ninterpretation, this requirement must be understood as also closely\ntied to the need to attend to normative considerations of overall\nrationality. A direct consequence of this holistic approach is that\nthere will always be more than one theory of interpretation that will\nbe adequate to any particular body of evidence since theories may\ndiffer in particular attributions of belief or assignments of meaning\nwhile nevertheless providing an equally satisfactory account of the\nspeaker\u2019s overall behaviour. It is this failure of uniqueness\nthat Davidson terms the \u2018indeterminacy\u2019 of interpretation\nand which provides a counterpart to the \u2018indeterminacy of\ntranslation\u2019 that also appears, though it has a more limited\napplication, in Quine. On the Davidsonian account, such indeterminacy\noften goes unnoticed and is indeed rather less for Davidson than for\nQuine (partly as a consequence of Davidson\u2019s employment of\nTarski and so of the need to read the structure of first-order logic\ninto the language interpreted). It nevertheless remains an\nineliminable feature of all interpretation. Moreover, such\nindeterminacy is not to be viewed merely as reflecting some\nepistemological limitation on interpretation, but rather derives from\nthe holistic character of meaning and of belief. Such concepts refer\nus to overall patterns in the behaviour of speakers rather than to\ndiscrete, entities to which interpretation must somehow gain access.\nIndeed, holism of this sort applies, not only to meanings and beliefs,\nbut also to the so-called \u2018propositional attitudes\u2019 in\ngeneral. The latter are most simply characterised as attitudes\nspecifiable by reference to a proposition (believing that there is\neggplant for dinner is a matter of holding true the proposition that\nthere is eggplant for dinner; desiring that there be eggplant for\ndinner is a matter of wanting it to be true that there be eggplant for\ndinner) and so the contents of attitudes of this sort are\nalways propositional. Davidsonian holism is thus a holism\nthat applies to meanings, to attitudes, and, thereby, to the content\nof attitudes. Indeed, we can speak of the Davidsonian account of\ninterpretation as providing a quite general account of how mental\ncontent is determined (such content being understood as the content of\npropositional mental states such as belief): through the causal\nrelation between speakers and objects in the world and through the\nrational integration of speakers\u2019 behaviour. Thus, as\nDavidson\u2019s approach to the theory of meaning turns out to imply\na more general theory of interpretation, so his holistic view of\nmeaning implies a holistic view of the mental, and of mental content,\nin general.\n\nDavidson\u2019s commitment to the indeterminacy that follows from his\nholistic approach has led some to view his position as involving a\nform of anti-realism about the mind and about beliefs, desires and so\nforth. Davidson argues, however, that the indeterminacy of\ninterpretation should be understood analogously with the indeterminacy\nthat attaches to measurement. Such theories assign numerical values to\nobjects on the basis of empirically observable phenomena and in\naccordance with certain formal theoretical constraints. Where there\nexist different theories that address the same phenomena, each theory\nmay assign different numerical values to the objects at issue (as do\nCelsius and Fahrenheit in the measurement of temperature), and yet\nthere need be no difference in the empirical adequacy of those\ntheories, since what is significant is the overall pattern of\nassignments rather than the value assigned in any particular case.\nSimilarly in interpretation, it is the overall pattern that a theory\nfinds in behaviour that is significant and that remains invariant\nbetween different, but equally adequate, theories. An account of\nmeaning for a language is an account of just this pattern.\n\nAlthough the indeterminacy thesis has sometimes been a focus for\nobjections to Davidson\u2019s approach, it is the more basic thesis\nof holism as developed in its full-blown form in the account of\nradical interpretation (and particularly as it relates to meaning)\nthat has often attracted the most direct and trenchant criticism.\nMichael Dummett has been one of the most important critics of the\nDavidsonian position (see especially Dummett 1975). Dummett argues\nthat Davidson\u2019s commitment to holism not only gives rise to\nproblems concerning, for instance, how a language can be learnt (since\nit seems to require that one come to understand the whole of the\nlanguage at one go, whereas learning is always piecemeal), but that it\nalso restricts Davidson from being able to give what Dummett views as\na properly full-blooded account of the nature of linguistic\nunderstanding (since it means that Davidson cannot provide an account\nthat explicates the semantic in terms of the non-semantic). Criticism\nhas also come from Jerry Fodor, amongst others, whose opposition to\nholism (not only in Davidson, but in Quine, Dennett and elsewhere) is\nlargely motivated by a desire to defend the possibility of a certain\nscientific approach to the mind (see especially, Fodor and Lepore\n1992).\n3.5 Language and Convention\n\nThe heart of a Davidsonian theory of interpretation is, of course, a\nTarskian truth theory. But a truth theory provides only the formal\nstructure on which linguistic interpretation is based: such a theory\nneeds to be embedded within a broader approach that looks to the\ninterconnections between utterances, other behaviour and attitudes; in\naddition, the application of such a theory to actual linguistic\nbehaviour must also take account of the dynamic and shifting character\nof such behaviour. This latter point is easily overlooked, but it\nleads Davidson to some important conclusions. Ordinary speech is full\nof ungrammatical constructions (constructions that may even be\nacknowledged to be ungrammatical by the speaker herself), incomplete\nsentences or phrases, metaphors, neologisms, jokes, puns and all\nmanner of phenomena that cannot be met simply by the application to\nutterances of a pre-existing theory for the language being spoken.\nLinguistic understanding cannot, then, be a matter simply of the\nmechanical application of a Tarski-like theory (although this is just\nwhat Davidson might be taken to suggest in the early essays). In\npapers such as \u2018A Nice Derangement of Epitaphs\u2019 (1986),\nDavidson addresses just this point, arguing that while linguistic\nunderstanding does indeed depend upon a grasp of the formal structure\nof a language, that structure always stands in need of modification in\nthe light of actual linguistic behaviour. Understanding a language is\na matter of continually adjusting interpretative presuppositions\n(presuppositions that are often not explicit) in accord with the\nutterances to be interpreted. Furthermore, this calls upon skills and\nknowledge (imagination, attentiveness to the attitudes and behaviour\nof others, knowledge of the world) that are not specifically\nlinguistic and that are part of a more general ability to get on in\nthe world and in relation to others \u2013 an ability that also\nresists any formal explication. In \u2018A Nice Derangement of\nEpitaphs\u2019, Davidson puts this point, in provocative fashion, by\nclaiming that \u2018there is no such thing as a language\u2019\n(adding the immediate qualification \u2018not if a language is\nanything like what many philosophers and linguists have\nsupposed\u2019). Put less provocatively, the essential point is that\nlinguistic conventions (and in particular linguistic conventions that\ntake the form of agreement over the employment of shared syntactic and\nsemantic rules), while they may well facilitate understanding, cannot\nbe the basis for such understanding.\n\nDavidson\u2019s denial of rule-based conventions as having a founding\nrole in linguistic understanding, together with his emphasis on the\nway in which the capacity for linguistic understanding must be seen as\npart as part of a more general set of capacities for getting on in the\nworld, underlie Davidson\u2019s much-discussed account of metaphor\nand related features of language (see \u2018What Metaphors\nMean\u2019 [1978b]). Davidson rejects the idea that metaphorical\nlanguage can be explained by reference to any set of rules that govern\nsuch meaning. Instead it depends on using sentences with their\n\u2018literal\u2019 or standard meanings in ways that give rise to\nnew or unexpected insights, and just as there are no rules by which we\ncan work out what a speaker means when she utters an ungrammatical\nsentence, makes a pun or otherwise uses language in a way that\ndiverges from the norm, so there are no rules that govern the grasp of\nmetaphor.\n4. Knowledge and Belief\n4.1 \u2018Three Varieties of Knowledge\u2019\n\nIn Davidson\u2019s work the question \u2018what is meaning?\u2019\nis replaced by the question \u2018What would a speaker need to know\nto understand the utterances of another?\u2019 The result is an\naccount that treats the theory of meaning as necessarily part of a\nmuch broader theory of interpretation and, indeed, of a much broader\napproach to the mental as such. This account is holistic inasmuch as\nit requires that any adequate theory must address linguistic and\nnon-linguistic behaviour in its entirety. As we have already seen,\nthis means that a theory of interpretation must adopt a compositional\napproach to the analysis of meaning; it must recognise the\ninterconnected character of attitudes and of attitudes and behaviour;\nand it must also attribute attitudes and interpret behaviour in a way\nconstrained by normative principles of rationality. Rationality is\nnot, however, the only principle on which Davidson\u2019s account of\nradical interpretation depends. It involves, in fact, a marriage of\nboth holistic and \u2018externalist\u2019 considerations:\nconsiderations concerning the dependence of attitudinal content on the\nrational connections between attitudes (\u2018holism\u2019) and\nconcerning the dependence of such content on the causal connections\nbetween attitudes and objects in the world\n(\u2018externalism\u2019). Indeed, this marriage is evident, as we\nsaw earlier, in the principle of charity itself and its combination of\nconsiderations of both \u2018coherence\u2019 and\n\u2018correspondence\u2019. Davidson holds, in fact, that attitudes\ncan be attributed, and so attitudinal content determined, only on the\nbasis of a triangular structure that requires interaction between at\nleast two creatures as well as interaction between each creature and a\nset of common objects in the world.\n\nIdentifying the content of attitudes is a matter of identifying the\nobjects of those attitudes, and, in the most basic cases, the objects\nof attitudes are identical with the causes of those same attitudes (as\nthe cause of my belief that there is a bird outside my window is the\nbird outside my window). Identifying beliefs involves a process\nanalogous to that of \u2018triangulation\u2019 (as employed in\ntopographical surveying and in the fixing of location) whereby the\nposition of an object (or some location or topographical feature) is\ndetermined by taking a line from each of two already known locations\nto the object in question \u2013 the intersection of the lines fixes\nthe position of the object (this idea first appears in \u2018Rational\nAnimals [1982]). Similarly, the objects of propositional attitudes are\nfixed by looking to find objects that are the common causes, and so\nthe common objects, of the attitudes of two or more speakers who can\nobserve and respond to one another\u2019s behaviour. In \u2018Three\nVarieties of Knowledge\u2019, Davidson develops the idea of\ntriangulation as a means to elaborate the three-way conceptual\ninterdependence that he argues obtains between knowledge of oneself,\nknowledge of others and knowledge of the world. Just as knowledge of\nlanguage cannot be separated from our more general knowledge of the\nworld, so Davidson argues that knowledge of oneself, knowledge of\nother persons and knowledge of a common, \u2018objective\u2019 world\nform an interdependent set of concepts no one of which is possible in\nthe absence of the others.\n\nThe idea of triangulation has important implications that go far\nbeyond questions of knowledge alone, and the idea is one of the most\nimportant and enduring, but also controversial elements in\nDavidson\u2019s later thinking (see Myers and Verheggen, 2016).\nMoreover, although the idea may appear at first sight to be intended\npurely as a metaphor, the structure of triangulation seems actually to\ndirect attention to the way in which knowledge, action, and content\nare fundamentally dependent on the genuinely embodied and located\ncharacter of speakers and agents. As Davidson presents matters, it is\nonly through their concrete engagement in the world, in relation both\nto objects and to other speakers or agents, that a putative speaker or\nagent can be capable of genuine speaking or agency; only then can they\nspeak, act, or think.\n\nThe emphasis on the holistic and externalist character of knowledge\nand of content that is so central to triangulation is also expressed\nin Davidson\u2019s well-known \u2018Swampman\u2019 example (in\n\u2018Knowing One\u2019s own Mind\u2019, Davidson 1987:\n443\u20134) Here we are asked to imagine a situation in which a\nlightning strike in a swamp reduces Davidson\u2019s body to its basic\nelements, while simultaneously transforming a nearby dead tree into an\nexact replica of him. Although the resulting \u2018Swampman\u2019\nbehaves exactly like the original author of \u2018Radical\nInterpretation\u2019, Davidson denies that the \u2018Swampman\u2019\ncould properly be said to have thoughts or its words have meaning\n\u2013 and the reason is simply that the Swampman would lack the sort\nof causal history that is required in order to establish the right\nconnections between itself, others and the world that underpin the\nattribution of thought and meaning. For all its notoriety, however,\nthe Swampman example is not elaborated upon by Davidson, and the\nexample has a very limited usefulness. In this respect, the attention\nSwampman has generated is quite disproportionate to his extremely\nbrief appearance in Davidson\u2019s writing.\n4.2 Against Relativism and Scepticism\n\nAlthough it is not simply an epistemological notion, the way Davidson\npresents the idea of triangulation tends to be such as to bring its\nepistemological implications to the fore. This is especially true of\nthe way Davidson develops the idea in \u2018Three Varieties of\nKnowledge\u2019. Since our knowledge of our own minds is not\nindependent of our knowledge of the world nor of our knowledge of\nothers, so we cannot treat self-knowledge as a matter of our having\naccess to some set of private \u2018mental\u2019 objects. Our\nknowledge of ourselves arises only in relation to our involvement with\nothers and with respect to a publicly accessible world \u2013 as well\nas a history of such involvement (this is indeed part of the point of\nthe Swampman example). Even so, we retain a certain authority over our\nown attitudes and utterances simply in virtue of the fact that those\nattitudes and utterances are indeed our own (see \u2018First-Person\nAuthority\u2019, [1984]). Moreover, because our knowledge of the\nworld is inseparable from other forms of knowledge, global\nepistemological scepticism (the view that all or most of our beliefs\nabout the world could be false) turns out to be committed to much more\nthan is usually supposed. Should it indeed turn out that our beliefs\nabout the world were all, or for the most part, false, then this would\nnot only imply the falsity of most of our beliefs about others, but it\nwould also have the peculiar consequence of making false most of our\nbeliefs about ourselves \u2013 including the supposition that we do\nindeed hold those particular false beliefs. Although this may fall\nshort of demonstrating the falsity of such scepticism, it surely\ndemonstrates it to be deeply problematic.\n\nThe way in which the Davidsonian rejection of scepticism does indeed\nderive quite directly from Davidson\u2019s adoption of a holistic,\nexternalist approach to knowledge, and to attitudinal content in\ngeneral, has sometimes been obscured by Davidson\u2019s presentation\nof his argument against scepticism through the employment (for the\nfirst time in \u2018Thought and Talk\u2019[1975]) of the rather\nproblematic notion of an \u2018omniscient interpreter\u2019 (the\nidea echoes one deployed by Wilfrid Sellars in an essay with which\nDavidson was certainly familiar [Sellars, 1948]). Such an interpreter\nwould attribute beliefs to others and assign meanings to their\nutterances but would nevertheless do so on the basis of her own (true)\nbeliefs. The omniscient interpreter would therefore have to find a\nlarge amount of agreement between her own beliefs and the beliefs of\nthose she interprets, and what was agreed would also, by hypothesis,\nbe true. Like the Swampman example, however, the omniscient\ninterpreter example has given rise to a number of complications and\nmisunderstandings (so much so that Davidson has expressed regret at\never having deployed those examples in the first place), and although\nthe omniscient interpreter appears at several places in\nDavidson\u2019s writings, the idea disappears from his later\ndiscussions, and does not play a crucial role in his thinking.\n\nA feature of both the triangulation argument, and the Davidsonian\naccount of radical interpretation, is that the attribution of\nattitudes must always proceed in tandem with the interpretation of\nutterances \u2013 identifying content, whether of utterances or of\nattitudes, is indeed a single project. An inability to interpret\nutterances (that is, an inability to assign meanings to instances of\nputative linguistic behaviour) will thereby imply an inability to\nattribute attitudes (and vice versa). A creature that we cannot\ninterpret as capable of meaningful speech will thus also be a creature\nthat we cannot interpret as capable of possessing contentful\nattitudes. Such considerations lead Davidson to deny that\nnon-linguistic animals are capable of thought \u2013 where thought\ninvolves the possession of propositional attitudes such as beliefs or\ndesires (see especially \u2018Thought and Talk\u2019). This does not\nmean that such animals have no mental life at all, nor does it mean\nthat we cannot usefully use mental concepts in explaining and\npredicting the behaviour of such creatures. What it does mean,\nhowever, is that the extent to which we can think of such creatures as\nhaving attitudes and a mental life like our own is measured by the\nextent to which we can assign determinate propositional content to the\nattitudes we would ascribe to those creatures. A further consequence\nof this view is that the idea of an untranslatable language \u2013 an\nnotion often found in association with the thesis of conceptual\nrelativism \u2013 cannot be given any coherent formulation\n(Davidson\u2019s argument here is suggestive, as Davidson notes, of a\nform of transcendental argumentation; see Davidson, 2001b: 72; but\nalso Davidson, in Hahn, 1999: 342\u20134). Inability to translate\ncounts as evidence, not of the existence of an untranslatable\nlanguage, but of the absence of a language of any sort (see \u2018On\nthe Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme\u2019 [1974])\n4.3 The \u2018Third Dogma\u2019 of Empiricism\n\nDavidson\u2019s rejection of the idea of an untranslatable language\n(and the associated idea, also common to many forms of conceptual\nrelativism, of a radically different, and so\n\u2018incommensurable\u2019 system of belief) is part of a more\ngeneral argument that he advances (notably in \u2018On the Very Idea\nof a Conceptual Scheme\u2019) against the so-called \u2018third\ndogma\u2019 of empiricism. The first two dogmas are those famously\nidentified by Quine in \u2018Two Dogmas of Empiricism\u2019 (first\npublished in the Philosophical Review, in 1951). The first is\nthat of reductionism (the idea that, for any meaningful statement, it\ncan be recast in the language of pure sensory experience, or, at\nleast, in terms of a set of confirmatory instances), while the second\nis the analytic-synthetic distinction (the idea that, with respect to\nall meaningful statements, one can distinguish between statements that\nare true in virtue of their meaning and those that are true in virtue\nof both their meanings and some fact or facts about the world). The\nrejection of both these dogmas can be seen as an important element\nthroughout Davidson\u2019s thinking. The third dogma, which Davidson\nclaims can still be discerned in Quine\u2019s work (and so can\nsurvive the rejection even of the analytic-synthetic distinction),\nconsists in the idea that one can distinguish within knowledge or\nexperience between a conceptual component (the \u2018conceptual\nscheme\u2019) and an empirical component (the \u2018empirical\ncontent\u2019) \u2013 the former is often taken to derive from\nlanguage and the later from experience, nature or some form of\n\u2018sensory input\u2019. While there are difficulties in even\narriving at a clear formulation of this distinction (particularly so\nfar as the nature of the relation between the two components is\nconcerned), such a distinction depends on being able to distinguish,\nat some basic level, between a \u2018subjective\u2019 contribution\nto knowledge that comes from us and an \u2018objective\u2019\ncontribution that comes from the world. What the Davidsonian account\nof knowledge and interpretation demonstrates, however, is that no such\ndistinction can be drawn. Attitudes are already interconnected with\nobjects and events in the world (causally, semantically and\nepistemically), whilst knowledge of self and others already\npresupposes knowledge of the world. The very idea of a conceptual\nscheme is thus rejected by Davidson along with the idea of any strong\nform of conceptual relativism. To possess attitudes and be capable of\nspeech is already to be capable of interpreting others and to be open\nto interpretation by them.\n4.4 Truth, Predication, and Realism/Anti-Realism\n\nDavidson emphasizes the holistic character of the mental (both in\nterms of the interdependence that obtains between various forms of\nknowledge as well as the interconnected character of attitudes and of\nattitudes and behaviour). He has, at times, also referred to his\nposition as involving a \u2018coherence\u2019 theory of truth and of\nknowledge (in \u2018A Coherence Theory of Truth and Knowledge\u2019\n[1983]). Nevertheless, Davidson is not a coherentist, in any standard\nsense, about either truth or knowledge. Nor, for all that he adopts a\nTarskian approach to meaning, does he espouse a correspondence theory\nof truth (in fact, he denies that a Tarskian truth theory is a\ncorrespondence theory in any conventional sense). In general, Davidson\neschews the attempt to provide an account of the nature of truth,\nmaintaining that truth is a central concept that cannot be reduced to\nor replaced by any other notion (see [Davidson 1990a] and [Davidson\n2005b]). Since he takes truth to belong to sentences or statements,\nand not to \u2018propositions\u2019 in any philosophically\nsignificant sense (in Truth and Predication [2005b], he is\nparticularly emphatic in rejecting the idea of the proposition as a\ntheoretical or explanatory concept), Davidson denies that truths can\nbe understood as timeless or eternal (or at least they are no more so\nthan are languages or sentences themselves). The only way of defining\ntruth, as Davidson sees it, is by means of a Tarskian truth theory and\nsuch a theory is not a definition of truth in any unqualified sense,\nbut only a definition of the truth predicate as it applies within a\nparticular language.\n\nDavidson\u2019s employment of the notion of coherence is best viewed,\nnot as a way of understanding truth, but rather as reflecting his\ncommitment to the fundamentally rational and holistic character of the\nmind. It also connects with Davidson\u2019s rejection of those forms\nof epistemological foundationalism that would attempt to ground\nknowledge or belief in the sensory causes of belief \u2013 beliefs,\nas one might expect given Davidson\u2019s holistic approach, can find\nevidential support only in other beliefs. Similarly, Davidson\u2019s\nsometime employment of the notion of correspondence is best\nunderstood, not as providing, any direct elucidation of the nature of\ntruth, but rather as deriving from his externalist commitment to the\nidea that the content of belief is dependent upon the worldly causes\nof belief. In \u2018True to the Facts\u2019 (1969b) Davidson does\ndefend what he there presents as a form of correspondence theory of\ntruth. However, not only does Davidson later relinquish the claim that\nhis is a \u2018correspondence\u2019 view of truth (this is already\nevident in \u2018The Structure and Content of Truth\u2019 [1990a],\nmuch of the material from which was later incorporated into Truth\nand Predication [2005b]), but the account set out in \u2018True\nto the Facts\u2019 is, in any case, far removed from what is usually\ntaken to be involved in any correspondence theory.\n\nThe strategy that Davidson employs in relation to the concept of truth\nreflects a more general approach that runs throughout his thinking.\nRather than trying to reduce key concepts, like truth, to something\nelse, his tendency is to retain the primitive character of those\nconcepts and instead to look to how they are worked out within the\nlarger structure to which they belong (in this respect, Davidson is a\nmoderate \u2018deflationist\u2019 about most of his key concepts).\nThe strategy Davidson adopts in respect of truth is therefore much the\nsame strategy as that which he adopts with respect to meaning (which\nshould not surprise us given the role Tarski plays): meaning belongs\nprimarily to sentences, it is not reducible to any other notion, and\nit is explicated only by reference to a larger linguistic structure.\nMoreover, this strategy is also one Davidson applies to the topic that\noccupies a large part of his last work \u2013 his inquiry into the\nproblem of the problem of predication or of the unity of the\nproposition (2005b). How are we to elucidate the relation between a\nsubject and that which is predicated of it in a standard predicative\nsentence such as \u2018Socrates is mortal\u2019? The problem, like\nthe problem that arises when one tries to use the truth predicate\nreflexively, is that any attempt to explicate the predicative relation\nseems to give rise to circularity or regress. Davidson\u2019s\nsolution is to deny that predication can be explained by resort to any\nprior notion of propositionality. Instead, Davidson takes predication\nas basic, irreducible, and able to be explicated only through the sort\nof structure that is revealed by a Tarski-style theory of meaning.\n\nThe question of truth lies at the heart of the realist/anti-realist\ncontroversy that was once a major concern of many Anglo-American\nphilosophers. Despite his insistence on the indispensability of an\nirreducibly basic concept of objective truth, and his rejection of\nboth sceptical and relativist positions, Davidson has been variously\nassimilated, at different times and by different critics, to both the\nrealist and the anti-realist camps. Yet realism and anti-realism are\nequally unsatisfactory from a Davidsonian point of view, since neither\nis compatible with the holistic and externalist character of knowledge\nand belief. Realism makes truth inaccessible (inasmuch as it admits\nthe sceptical possibility that even our best-confirmed theories about\nthe world could all be false), while anti-realism makes truth too\nepistemic (inasmuch as it rejects the idea of truth as objective). In\nthis respect, and as he himself makes clear (see 1990a, 2005b),\nDavidson does not merely reject the specific premises that underlie\nthe realist and anti-realist positions but views the very dispute\nbetween them as essentially misconceived. This reflects a\ncharacteristic feature of Davidson\u2019s thinking in general (and\nnot just as it relates to realism and anti-realism), namely its\nresistance to any simple classification using the standard\nphilosophical categories of the day.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "1957, <em>Decision-Making: An Experimental Approach</em>, with P.\nSuppes, Stanford: Stanford University Press, reprinted 1977, Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press, Midway Reprint Series.", "1963, \u2018Actions, Reasons and Causes\u2019, <em>Journal of\nPhilosophy</em>, 60: 685\u2013700; reprinted in Davidson 2001a.", "1967a, \u2018Causal Relations\u2019, <em>Journal of\nPhilosophy</em>, 64: 691\u2013703; reprinted in Davidson 2001a.", "1967b, \u2018The Logical Form of Action Sentences\u2019, in\nNicholas Rescher (ed.), <em>The Logic of Decision and Action</em>,\nPittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, reprinted in Davidson,\n2001a.", "1967c, \u2018Truth and Meaning\u2019, <em>Synthese</em>, 17:\n304\u201323; reprinted in Davidson 2001b.", "1968, \u2018On Saying That\u2019, <em>Synthese</em>, 19:\n130\u201346; reprinted in Davidson 2001b.", "1969a, \u2018The Individuation of Events\u2019, in Nicholas\nRescher (ed.), <em>Essays in Honor of Carl G.
