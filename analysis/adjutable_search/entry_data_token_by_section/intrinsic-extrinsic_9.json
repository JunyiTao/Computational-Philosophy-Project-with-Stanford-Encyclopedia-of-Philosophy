    "main_text": "Attempts at Analysis\n3. Attempts at Analysis\n\nOne reason to attempt an analysis of intrinsicality is that the\norientating characterisations of intrinsicality discussed in section\n 1\n and sections\n 2.2\n \u2013\n 2.4\n are all to some degree circular. (Cf Lewis 1983a and Yablo 1999.) For\nexample, a property \\(p\\) whose ascription to a thing \\(x\\) is about\n\\(x\\) is intrinsic only if it is about how \\(x\\) is\nintrinsically; \\(p\\) is not intrinsic if the ascription of\n\\(p\\) to \\(x\\) is about how \\(x\\) is extrinsically.\nSimilarly, a property \\(p\\) that is had by \\(x\\) in virtue of how\n\\(x\\) is is intrinsic only if \\(x\\) has \\(p\\) in virtue of how \\(x\\)\nis intrinsically; \\(p\\) need not be intrinsic if\n\\(x\\) has \\(p\\) in virtue of how \\(x\\) is extrinsically.\n\nSome of the following attempts to analyse intrinsicality are best seen\nas attempts to analyse the distinction between duplication preserving\nproperties and properties that aren\u2019t duplication preserving,\nwhile other attempts are best seen as attempts to analyse the\ndistinction between interior and exterior properties, or between local\nand non-local properties. For a discussion of whether we can give, or\nneed to give, a reductive analysis of intrinsicality, see Skiles 2014\nand Hoffman-Kolss 2018.)\n\nIn addition to the metaphysical project of determining what it is for\na property to be intrinsic, there is an epistemological project of\ndetermining how we can come to know with respect to particular\nproperties whether they are intrinsic, and whether such knowledge is\npossible. To some extent, the metaphysical project of determining what\nit is to be intrinsic can help with this epistemological project. For\nexample, if it can be shown that being intrinsic can be analysed as\nthe possession of such and such features, and we have knowledge of\nwhich properties have such and such features, then we can use this\nanalysis to explain how we can know of particular properties that they\nare intrinsic. In addition to employing such analyses of\nintrinsicality, however, we might hope to develop and describe further\nmethods for obtaining justified beliefs regarding what properties are\nintrinsic. For further discussion that bears on this issue, see\nMcQueen and van Woudenberg 2016.\n",
