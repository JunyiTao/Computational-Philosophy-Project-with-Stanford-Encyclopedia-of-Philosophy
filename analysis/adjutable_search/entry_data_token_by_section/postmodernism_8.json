    "main_text": "Postmodern Rhetoric and Aesthetics\n9. Habermas's Critique\n\nThe most prominent and comprehensive critic of philosophical\npostmodernism is J\u00fcrgen Habermas. In The Philosophical\nDiscourse of Modernity (Habermas 1987 [1985]), he confronts\npostmodernism at the level of society and \u201ccommunicative\naction.\u201d He does not defend the concept of the subject,\nconceived as consciousness or an autonomous self, against\npostmodernists' attacks, but defends argumentative reason in\ninter-subjective communication against their experimental,\navant-garde strategies. For example, he claims that Nietzsche,\nHeidegger, Derrida and Foucault commit a performative contradiction\nin their critiques of modernism by employing concepts and methods\nthat only modern reason can provide. He criticizes Nietzsche's\nDionysianism as a compensatory gesture toward the loss of unity in\nWestern culture that, in pre-modern times, was provided by religion.\nNietzsche's sense of a new Dionysus in modern art, moreover, is based\nupon an aesthetic modernism in which art acquires its experimental\npower by separating itself from the values of science and morality, a\nseparation accomplished by the modern Enlightenment, resulting in the\nloss of organic unity Nietzsche seeks to restore via art itself (see\nHabermas 1987 [1985], 81-105). Habermas sees Heidegger and Derrida as\nheirs to this \u201cDionysian messianism.\u201d Heidegger, for\nexample, anticipates a new experience of being, which has\nwithdrawn. However, says Habermas, the withdrawal of being is the\nresult of an inverted philosophy of the subject, where Heidegger's\ndestruction of the subject leads to hope for a unity to come, a unity\nof nothing other than the subject that is now missing (Habermas 1987\n[1985], 160). Derrida, he says, develops the notion\nof diff\u00e9rance or \u201carchi-writing\u201d in\nsimilar fashion: here, we see the god Dionysus revealing himself once\nagain in his absence, as meaning infinitely deferred (Habermas 1987\n[1985], 180-81).\n\nHabermas also criticizes Derrida for leveling the distinction between\nphilosophy and literature in a textualism that brings logic and\nargumentative reason into the domain of rhetoric. In this way, he\nsays, Derrida hopes to avoid the logical problem of self-reference in\nhis critique of reason. However, as Habermas remarks: \u201cWhoever\ntransposes the radical critique of reason into the domain of rhetoric\nin order to blunt the paradox of self-referentiality, also dulls the\nsword of the critique of reason itself\u201d (Habermas 1987 [1985],\n210). In similar fashion, he criticizes Foucault for not subjecting\nhis own genealogical method to genealogical unmasking, which would\nreveal Foucault's re-installation of a modern subject able to\ncritically gaze at its own history. Thus, he says, \u201cFoucault\ncannot adequately deal with the persistent problems that come up in\nconnection with an interpretive approach to the object domain, a\nself-referential denial of universal validity claims, and a normative\njustification of critique\u201d (Habermas 1987 [1985], 286).\n\nHabermas's critique of postmodernism on the basis of performative\ncontradiction and the paradox of self-reference sets the tone and the\nterms for much of the critical debate now under way. While\npostmodernists have rejected these criticisms, or responded to them\nwith rhetorical counter-strategies.  Lyotard, for example, rejects\nthe notion that intersubjective communication implies a set of rules\nalready agreed upon, and that universal consensus is the ultimate\ngoal of discourse (see Lyotard 1984 [1979], 65-66).  That\npostmodernists openly respond to Habermas is due to the fact that he\ntakes postmodernism seriously and does not, like other critics,\nreject it as mere nonsense. Indeed, that he is able to read\npostmodernist texts closely and discursively testifies to their\nintelligibility. He also agrees with the postmodernists that the\nfocus of debate should be upon modernity as it is realized in social\npractices and institutions, rather than upon theories of cognition or\nformal linguistics as autonomous domains. In this respect, Habermas's\nconcern with inter-subjective communication helps clarify the basis\nupon which the modernist-postmodernist debates continue to play\nout. \n",
