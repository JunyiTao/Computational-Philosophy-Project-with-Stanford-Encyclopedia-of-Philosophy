Human persons are not law\u2019s creatures but its proper point\n\n\nTalk of human flourishing\u2019s or wellbeing\u2019s aspects, and of principles\nof practical reason, should not be allowed to distract attention from\nan important truth, implicit both in classical Greek and Roman\nphilosophical and juristic treatments of justice and in modern\njuristic attributions of human rights. Indeed, the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights (1948) links the two traditions of\ndiscourse by placing at the head of its articulation of human rights\nthe core (\u201call human beings are born free and equal in dignity\nand rights\u201d) of the Roman juristic saying (Institutes\n1.2.2) that \u201cby nature, from the outset, all human beings were\nborn free and equal,\u201d a saying about iustitia, justice\nas a ground and standard for ius, law. The same Roman law\ntexts, promulgated as permanent law by Justinian 533\u2013535 AD,\nstate more than once that law\u2019s point (its \u201cfinal\u201d\ncausa, explanatory reason) is the human persons for whose\nsake it is made, that is, all human persons until the time\nwhen the ius gentium, the common law of peoples, was\ndistorted by wars and slavery. Law, fit to take a directive place in\npractical reasoning towards morally sound judgment, is for the sake of\nhuman persons: all the members of the community regulated by that law\nand all other persons within that law\u2019s ambit.\n\n\nThat thesis falls within those parts of legal theory that are\nacknowledged but not much explored by contemporary legal\npositivists. It was ignored and in effect denied by earlier forms of\nlegal positivism more ambitious to cover the whole of legal\nphilosophy, e.g., Kelsen\u2019s. Kelsen denied that persons were known\neither to law or to a proper legal theory or science of law, except\ninsofar as they were made the subject of a posited legal rule. But\nagainst this restriction, which has misled some courts which have\ntreated Kelsenian legal science as a guide to judicial reasoning, it\ncan be said (Finnis 2000) that the fundamental equality and dignity of\nhuman beings should defended as part of a rationally sound\nunderstanding (concept) of law. This defense requires an account of\nthe difference between capacities which are activated here and now, or\nare more or less ready to be so actuated, and radical\ncapacities such as exist in the epigenetic primordia of even very\nyoung human beings, and in the genetic and somatic constitution of\neven the severely disabled.  Though such an account makes possible a\ndefense of the fundamental equality of human beings, and thus a\nhumanist legal theory, the point of the account is not to privilege a\nbiological species as such, but to affirm the juridical significance\nof the status of persons\u2014substances of a rational\nnature\u2014as inherently the bearers (subjects) of\nrights of a kind different and more respect-worthy and\nend-like than the rights which are often, as a matter of\ntechnical means, attributed by law to animals, idols, ships\nor other objects of legal proceedings.\n",
