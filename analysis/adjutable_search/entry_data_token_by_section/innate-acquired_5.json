    "main_text": "Outline of scientific debates over nativism || Nativism and the study of language acquisition\n1.5 Nativism and the study of language acquisition\n\nClassical ethology flourished in the years immediately following World\nWar Two (Burkhardt 2005). At the same time others started to question\nthe emphasis on environmental factors in behavioral development which\nhad developed between the wars in the wake of the behaviorist\nrevolution in psychology. Numerous lines of evidence suggested that\npsychology would have to take account of species-specific biological\nendowments if it was to understand how different species interact with\ntheir environment and the distinctive things each species is able to\nlearn from these interactions (e.g. Harlow 1953; Tomkins 1962;\nSeligman 1970). By far the most influential criticism of behaviorism,\nhowever, came from linguistics. The linguist Noam Chomsky argued that\nexisting behaviorist accounts of the development of language were\nunworkable and offered a general argument for the conclusion that the\nability to acquire language is innate (Chomsky 1957; 1959; 1966).\nAccording to this \u2018poverty of the stimulus\u2019 argument, the\nexamples of speech to which children are exposed do not contain enough\nevidence to settle which utterances are grammatical in the language\nthey are trying to acquire. Nevertheless, children reliably acquire\nthe grammar of their native language. Therefore, Chomsky and his\nfollowers concluded, children must have innate knowledge about grammar\nwhich supplements the evidence to which they are exposed during\ndevelopment. If this argument is sound, every normal childhood is a\ndeprivation experiment that confirms the innateness of grammar. The\ndetails of the original poverty of the stimulus argument, its\nelaboration by Chomsky\u2019s followers, and the current state of the\nevidence for linguistic nativism are discussed in detail in the entry\n Innateness and Language.\n What matters for current purposes is that Chomsky\u2019s work\nproduced a very broad consensus in psychology that language\nacquisition is explained by a complex, evolved mechanism that is\npresent at birth and which can produce normal linguistic development\nin a wide range of environments, including those which are\n\u2018impoverished\u2019 with respect to language.\n\nThe \u2018language acquisition device\u2019 has served as an\nexemplar for research on whether other psychological and behavioral\ntraits are innate. Like the language acquisition device these\nputatively innate traits are supposed to explain patterns in the\ndevelopment of the child\u2019s mind. These patterns can be seen as\nrepresenting innate \u2018knowledge\u2019 or innate\n\u2018theories\u2019 about various cognitive domains. For example,\nthe eminent cognitive developmental psychologists Susan Carey and\nElizabeth Spelke argue that children possess four domains of innate\n\u2018core knowledge\u2019 which underlie much of their later\ncognitive development. These domains are \u2018objects, agents,\nnumbers and space\u2019 (Carey and Spelke 1996, 517). Children think\nabout each of these four domains in distinctive ways that do not seem\nto depend on the details of the child\u2019s environment. The\ndistinctive way in which children think about living, as opposed to\ninanimate, entities has also been proposed as a domain of innate\nknowledge (e.g. Medin and Atran 2004). The recent philosophical\nliterature on the concept of innateness which is outlined in later\nsections of this entry is mostly intended to analyse innateness as it\nis understood in this extensive body of \u2018neo-nativist\u2019\npsychology. The topic of\n innateness in language\n is covered separately. For a thorough introduction to this field and\nthe controversies arising from it, also see (Carruthers, et al. 2005;\n2007a; 2007b).\n",
