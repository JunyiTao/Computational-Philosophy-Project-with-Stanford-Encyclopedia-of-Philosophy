Logic in the First Editions of Leibniz\u2019s Works\n\n\nReferring to Leibniz was a common place in the initial period of\ndevelopment of modern mathematical logic. Obviously, the early\nlogicians saw some of their ideas represented in Leibniz, and in\naddition they had access to at least some of Leibniz\u2019s writings\nthat could lend support to this claim. But which of Leibniz\u2019s\nideas on logic could have been known in the middle of the 19th\ncentury?\n\n\nThe edition of Leibniz\u2019s philosophical works in Latin and\nFrench, published by Rudolph Erich Raspe (Leibniz 1765; cf. Hallo\n1934) contained some up to then unpublished letters and six pieces\nfrom the unpublished papers, of which two, \u201cDifficultates\nquaedam logicae\u201d and \u201cHistoria et commendatio linguae\ncharactericae\u201d, are relevant to logic. The most important\nfeature of Raspe\u2019s edition was the first publication of the\n\u201cNouveaux Essais sur l\u2019entendement humain\u201d which had\nbeen missing for sixty years. They influenced, e.g., Bernard Bolzano\nwho regarded Leibniz as an ally when writing his\nseminal Wissenschaftslehre (Bolzano 1837, 2014; Mugnai\n2011).\n\n\nIn 1768 Louis Dutens published the Opera omnia nunc primum\ncollecta in Classes distributa praefationibus & indicibus\nexornata (Leibniz 1768; cf. Heinekamp 1986), a rather complete\ncollection of Leibniz\u2019s published works. It contained some\nhitherto unpublished\ncorrespondences.\n\n\nThe \u201cNouveaux Essais\u201d count as Leibniz\u2019s main work\nin epistemology. They were written between 1703 and 1705 and contained\ncriticism of John Locke\u2019s An Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding (Locke 1690). Locke died in 1704\nwhen Leibniz was still working on the essays. The text caused a great\nsensation when it was published by Raspe. It can therefore be regarded\nas a key text for the reception of Leibniz in the late 18th and the\n19th century. Logical considerations can be found in the fourth book\n\u201cDe la connaissance\u201d. They concentrate on the theory of\nsyllogism, but all elements of Leibniz\u2019s theory of logic are\npresent, to the extent that they are regarded as a device for the\nevaluation of the validity of given theses (ars iudicandi) and\nfor finding new truths on the basis of given truths (ars\ninveniendi).\n\n\nLeibniz stresses in the \u201cNouveaux essais\u201d that\nsyllogistic is part of a sort of universal mathematics, an art of\ninfallibility (art d\u2019infaillibilit\u00e9). This art is\nnot restricted to syllogisms, but concerns all kinds of formal proofs,\ni.e. all reasoning in which inferences are executed by virtue of their\nform (NE, ch. XVII, \u00a74). According to Leibniz, there are\nsome problems with algebra in that it is still far from being an art of\ninvention. It has to be supplemented by a general art of signs or an\nart of characteristic (NE, ch. XVII, \u00a79).\n",
