The package of\nProbabilism and the Principle of Conditionalization seems to explain\nwell why one\u2019s credence in General Relativity ought to rise in\nEddington\u2019s Observation Case. But that particular Bayesian\nexplanation relies on a crucial feature of the case: the evidence\nE is entailed by the hypothesis H in question.\nBut such an entailment is missing in many interesting cases, such as\nthis one:\n\n\nExample (Enumerative Induction). After a day\nof field research, we observed one hundred black ravens without a\ncounterexample. So the newly acquired evidence is E = \u201cwe\nhave observed one hundred ravens and they all were black\u201d. We\nare interested in this hypothesis H = \u201cthe next raven to\nbe observed will be black\u201d.\n\n\n\nNow, should the credence in the hypothesis be increased or lowered,\naccording to the two core Bayesian norms? Well, it depends. Note that\nin the present case H entails neither E nor its\nnegation, so the possibilities in H can be categorized into two\ngroups: those compatible with E, and those incompatible with\nE. As a result of conditionalization, the possibilities\nincompatible with E will have their credences be dropped down\nto zero; those compatible, scaled up. If the scaling up outweighs the\ndropping down for the possibilities inside H, the credence in\nH will rise and thus behave inductively; otherwise, it will\nstay constant or even go down and thus behave counter-inductively. So\nit all depends on the specific details of the prior, which is\nshorthand for the assignment of credences that one has before one\nacquires the new evidence in question. To sum up: Probabilism and the\nPrinciple of Conditionalization, alone, are too weak to entitle us to\nsay whether one\u2019s credence ought to change inductively or\ncounter-inductively in the above example.\n\nThis point just made generalizes to most applications of Bayesian\nepistemology. For example, some coherent priors lead to enumerative\ninduction and some don\u2019t (Carnap 1955), and some coherent priors\nlead to Ockham\u2019s razor and some don\u2019t (Forster 1995: sec.\n3). So, besides the coherence norms (such as Probabilism), are there\nany other norms that govern one\u2019s prior? This is known as\nthe problem of the priors.\n\nThis issue divides Bayesians. First of all, there is the party of\nsubjective Bayesians, who hold that every prior is permitted\nunless it fails to be coherent. So, to those Bayesians, the correct\nnorms for priors are exhausted by Probabilism and the other coherence\nnorms if any. Second, there is the party of objective\nBayesians, who propose that the correct norms for priors include\nnot just the coherence norms but also a norm that codifies the\nepistemic virtue of freedom from bias. Those Bayesians think that\nfreedom from bias requires at least that, roughly speaking,\none\u2019s credences be evenly distributed to certain possibilities\nunless there is a reason not to. This norm, known as the Principle\nof Indifference, has long been a source of controversy. Last but\nnot the least, some Bayesians even propose to take seriously certain\nepistemic virtues that have been extensively studied in other\nepistemological traditions, and argue that those virtues need to be\ncodified into norms for priors. For more on those attempted solutions\nto the problem of the priors, see\n section 4\n below. Also see\n section 3.3 of the entry on interpretations of probability.\n\nSo far I have been mostly taking for granted the package of\nProbabilism and the Principle of Conditionalization. But is there any\ngood reason to accept those two norms? This is the next topic.\n\n\n",
