His view is difficult to interpret, even though\nthe texts dealing with this topic (Categories, Topics\nI, and Metaphysics V) are characteristically direct\nin style. Still, there is some consensus among scholars that Aristotle\nproposes three ways of understanding categories: as realities,\nconcepts, and linguistic terms. Much of the subsequent philosophical\ndiscussion of categories concerns the correctness of this view. Some\nfavor a position according to which categories are realities, which\nare then said to be reflected in thought and language; some endorse a\nview of them merely as concepts, which are also said to be reflected\nin language; some maintain that categories are merely linguistic\nterms, and reject any implication that they are real entities or\nconcepts; and still others maintain an inclusive view that contends\nthat categories are all three: words, concepts, and extra-mental\nentities.\n\n\nThe Greek term that Aristotle uses for category means predicate\n(categoria) so that categories would appear to be\nkinds of predicates, the most general kinds of predicates. However,\nsome commentators claim that Aristotle uses the term rather for kinds\nof predication and kinds of beings (for example in Topics\n103b20\u201327, and Metaphysics 1017a22\u201327; see Frede\n1987, 29\u201348). In Categories, Aristotle uses the term\ntechnically to refer to substance, quantity,\nquality, relation, place, time,\nposition, state, action, and\naffection (9a27, 11b37, 11b7), although he also speaks of\nless general terms, such as \u2018white,\u2019 \u2018half,\u2019\nand \u2018last year,\u2019 and trans-categorial terms such as\n\u2018good\u2019 and \u2018unity.\u2019 Aristotle's\ncategories are not, strictly speaking, the predicates we use when we\nspeak in ordinary language; rather, they are the most general kinds of\npredicates, or predications. Thus \u2018white\u2019 and\n\u2018here\u2019 do not refer to categories, but\n\u2018quality\u2019 and \u2018place\u2019 do. The Aristotelian\ncategories may be taken as the most general predicates which can be\npredicated or, alternatively, they are the most general kinds of\npredication into which the predicates we use in ordinary discourse may\nbe classified. They provide answers to direct questions such as when,\nwhere, how, what, and so on. Terms that extend to more than one\ncategory (e.g., \u2018good\u2019), or do not apply to categories\n(e.g., \u2018and\u2019) are treated separately.\n\n\nPredicability, then, is not a sufficient condition of categoricity,\nbut non-predicability is a sufficient disqualification. For Aristotle,\nthe individual is not, strictly speaking, predicable, although there\nare places in which he speaks of the individual as\npredicable. Examples of individuals are this horse and a\ncertain point of grammar present in the knower (1b5). The first\nis what Aristotle calls a primary substance, which he defines\nin Categories as that which is neither predicable of, nor\npresent in, a subject (2a11). The second is, like a primary substance,\nnon-predicable, but it can be present in a subject. Both are\nindividual and neither is predicable.\n\n\nThat Aristotle refers to categories with the Greek term which\ncorresponds roughly to the term \u2018predicate\u2019 in English\ndoes not mean that he understood categories to be merely linguistic\nterms.  Indeed, \u2018predicate\u2019 itself is used in a variety of\nways by philosophers. Some think of predicates as properties of some\nkind, some as concepts, some as words, and so on. Therefore, to say\nthat something is a predicate does not necessarily mean that it is a\nlinguistic term.  In the case of Aristotle, there is ample evidence in\nCategories itself which suggests that categories are not just\nlinguistic terms that reflect the fundamental ways in which we speak\nabout things, but also ways in which things are. The interpretative\ntradition that favors a linguistic or logical understanding of the\ncategories goes back at least to Porphyry (1887, 56), who tries to\nreconcile what he takes to be Aristotle's linguistic/logical position\nwith Plato's metaphysics (Ebbesen 1990). Consider for example how\nAristotle introduces the categories: \u201cOf things said without any\ncombination, each signifies either a substance or quantity or\nqualification or a relative or where or when or being-in-a-position or\nhaving or doing or being-affected\u201d (1b25). Clearly, he is\ntalking about language when he says, \u201cOf things said\nwithout combination, each signifies\u2026.\u201d for\nthings that are said and that signify are linguistic terms\n(Poetics 1456b38ff; our emphasis). The linguistic emphasis is\nreinforced elsewhere, when he adds that \u201cof things which are\nsaid without any combination none is either true or\nfalse\u2026\u201d (2a9).\n\n\nAt the same time, these statements do not imply that what is signified\nnecessarily has to be linguistic. Indeed, earlier in\nCategories, Aristotle unabashedly mixes the language of\n\u201clanguage\u201d with the language of \u201cbeing\u201d when\nhe notes: \u201cOf things that are: some are said\nof a subject but are not in any subject. For example, man is\nsaid of a subject, the individual man, but is not in any\nsubject\u201d (1a20; our emphasis). This text begins with a reference\nto things that are (ta onta), but goes on to speak about\nthings that are said (ta legomena). The same occurs in other\nplaces (2a11). In a text from Metaphysics (1017a23\u201325),\nthe isomorphism between being and language is openly expressed.\n\n\nAristotle is less explicit about the understanding of categories as\nconcepts. In Categories generally he does not speak about how\nthings are conceived; rather, he speaks about how things are\ncalled or how they are. At the same time, from what\nhe says elsewhere about signification and the way we think, it is not\nunreasonable to surmise that he also thinks of categories as concepts\nof some kind. For example, at the beginning of On\nInterpretation, he claims that \u201cspoken sounds are symbols\nof affections [or concepts] in the soul, and written marks symbols of\nspoken sounds. And just as written marks are not the same for all men,\nneither are spoken sounds. But what these are in the first place\nsounds of\u2013affections of the soul\u2013are the same for all; and\nwhat these affections are likenesses of\u2013actual things\u2013are\nalso the same\u201d (16a 4\u20138).\n\n\nNone of this, however, is very clear. Indeed, Aristotle never actually\nsays that categories are words, concepts, or realities; he only speaks\nof them as categories, that is, predicates. But\n\u2018predicate\u2019 can be used to mean realities, concepts, or\nlinguistic terms. Aristotle does speak of categories as if\nthey were realities or linguistic terms, and one can further infer\nthat he could have spoken of them as if they were\nconcepts. But this does not definitely clarify what he thinks about\nthem. Indeed, on the basis of what he says we cannot determine for\nsure that he even raises the question of the ultimate ontological\nstatus of categories.  The situation is further obscured because\nAristotle never identifies the discipline where categories are\nsupposed to be studied and he treats them in both logical\n(Categories, Topics) and metaphysical\n(Metaphysics) contexts.\n\n\nOne more point needs to be made clear. Aristotle never clearly and\nconsistently ties the categories to sentential or propositional\nstructure. In Categories he appears to consider them in\nisolation from their syntactical context, but in Topics\n(103b20\u201327) and Metaphysics (1017a23\u201325) he seems\nto tie them to predication and, thus, to consider them in relation to\na syntactical context. This ambiguity gives rise to different\ninterpretations, such as that of Frede, who considers them to be kinds\nof predications (1987), and that of Ryle, who views them as\nindependent from syntactical context (1971). In short, the picture is\nfar from clear, and this serves to separate Aristotle from authors who\nexplicitly and exclusively view categories as reflecting syntactical\ncontexts.\n\n\nThe same ambiguity with respect to the ontological status of\ncategories that we find in Aristotle is found in many of his medieval\ncommentators. Perhaps this can be taken as a sign that they believe\ncategories to be realities, concepts, and linguistic terms, that is,\nthat categories are ways in which the world is, ways in which we think\nabout the world, and ways in which we speak about the world. However,\nthere are some who argue for purely linguistic or conceptual ways of\nunderstanding categories. In modern philosophy, the emphasis shifts\ntoward the language of thought, a prime example of which is Immanuel\nKant (1724\u20131804; see Gracia 2000).\n",
