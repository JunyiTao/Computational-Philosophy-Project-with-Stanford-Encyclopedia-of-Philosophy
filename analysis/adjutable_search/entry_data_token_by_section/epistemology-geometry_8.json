Non-Euclidean geometry\n\nInvestigations of the parallel postulate began in Greek times,\ncontinued in the Islamic world, and were undertaken in the early\nmodern West. But, for reasons which are still unclear, after around\n1800 it became easier for people to imagine that Euclid\u2019s\nElements might not be the only possible system of metrical\ngeometry. Among the factors that can help explain how the unthinkable\nbecame thinkable even outside the community of mathematicians was the\naccumulation of theorems based on assumptions other than the parallel\npostulate. It would seem that the production of novel, consistent\nconsequences of such a radical assumption, and the failure to find a\ncontradiction, inclined some people to contemplate that there might\nindeed be a whole geometry different from Euclid\u2019s. It may also\nbe relevant that this process coincided with the full assimilation of\nimaginary numbers (and the rise of complex function theory); indeed,\nLobachevskii called his theory \"Imaginary geometry\".\n\nA change in attitudes can be noticed already by the late 18th century.\nIn 1759 d\u2019Alembert called the problem of parallel lines\n\u201cle scandale des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de\ng\u00e9om\u00e9trie.\u201d In 1763, the dissertation of G. S.\nKl\u00fcgel examined a large number of attempts to prove the parallel\npostulate, concluding that they were all faulty: the result can be\nproven on the basis of axioms \"that are not clearer or more\nsecure than Euclid\u2019s,\" and thus Euclid was indeed right to\ninclude among the axioms \"a proposition that cannot be\ndemonstrated in correct form.\" Kl\u00fcgel's discussion\ncalled special attention to Saccheri\u2019s work (1733) as the most\ndetailed treatment in Modern times, and stimulated Lambert to do his\nown detailed work on the topic (1786). Later on, in 1816, Gauss\nrestated in print that the constantly increasing number of attempts to\nprove the postulate do not fill the gap, and that one should honestly\nand openly admit that \"in essence we have not come farther than\nEuclid 2000 years ago.\"\n\nPerhaps the signal example of this shift is the Law Professor F. K.\nSchweikart, who in 1818 sent Gauss via Gerling, a colleague and former\nstudent of his at the University of Marburg, an account of a geometry\nquite different from Euclid\u2019s. Schweikart\u2019s geometry was\naccepted by Gauss, who replied that all the properties of the new\ngeometry could be derived once a value was given for a constant that\nappeared in Schweikart\u2019s account. But on what grounds\u00a0Gauss\nhad accepted it, is less clear. As the years went by he came to be\nentirely confident that there was a new, two-dimensional geometry\ndifferent from Euclidean plane geometry. This geometry could be\ndescribed by formulae that he, following Lambert, would have seen were\nakin to those of spherical geometry. But he did not describe a\nthree-dimensional geometry of this kind, leaving open the possibility\nthat the two-dimensional geometry was some kind of formal, meaningless\noddity. On the other hand, in correspondence with Bessel he made it\nclear that he could not ascribe to Euclidean geometry the certainty he\ngave to arithmetic, which was a priori. Both he and Bessel kept open\nthe possibility that astronomical regions of space might fail to be\nEuclidean.\n\nCredit for the first fully mathematical descriptions of space in terms\nother than Euclid\u2019s must go to J\u00e1nos Bolyai in Hungary\nand Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevskii in Russia independently. Bolyai in\nhis \u201cAppendix scientiam spatii absolute veram\nexhibens\u201d (1832) and Lobachevskii in his Neue\nAnfangsgr\u00fcnde der Geometrie (1835) and again in his\nGeometrische Untersuchungen (1840) replaced the parallel\npostulate with the assumption that given a line L and a point not on\nthat line, there are many lines through the point that lie in the\nplane defined by L and the given point, but that do not meet the line\nL. Of these, as they then showed, one line in each direction is\nasymptotic to L, and these asymptotic lines divide the family of all\nthe other lines in the given plane and through the given point into\ntwo families: those that meet L, and those that do not. Much work then\nfollowed, famously similar in each case, in particular to show that in\nthe three-dimensional space described by their assumptions there is a\nsurface upon which Euclidean geometry holds, and to deduce the\nexistence of trigonometrical formulae describing triangles in the\nplane. These formulae resemble the corresponding formulae for\ntriangles on the sphere.\n\nAll this convinced both Bolyai and Lobachevskii that the new geometry\ncould be a description of physical space and it would henceforth be an\nempirical task to decide whether Euclidean geometry or non-Euclidean\ngeometry was true. Lobachevskii even attempted to determine the matter\nby astronomical observations, but there were significant\nmethodological difficulties and his results were utterly\ninconclusive.\n\nIt is, of course, true, that no amount of consistent deductions in the\nnew geometry rules out the possibility that a contradiction does\nexist, but the intriguing relationship of the new geometry to\nspherical geometry, and the existence of trigonometric formulae for\ntriangles strongly suggested that the new geometry was at least\nconsistent. Those who did accept it, and they were very few before the\n1860s, nonetheless may well have welcomed a better account than the\none Bolyai and Lobachevskii provided. Even so, many geometers were to\nfind the formulae convincing \u2018proofs\u2019 of the validity of\nthe new geometry even after the reformulations of Riemann and Beltrami\n(for example, Enriques in his major essay (1907) on the principles of\ngeometry).\n\nIt is not just that there are formulae, but that they hint at an\nalternative formulation of geometry, one in which the geometry\ndescribed in Euclid\u2019s Elements might prove to be but a\nspecial case. If there could be another way to define geometry, one\nthat would lead to these formulae in various cases, the way would be\nopen to rethink all of the questions about geometry that critical\nexamination had opened. The person best placed to do this in the 1830s\nand 1840s was Gauss: he knew very well what Bolyai and Lobachevskii\nhad done, and his differential geometry gave him the means to proceed,\nbut, curiously, he did not do so. In the early 1840s he wrote some\nnotes that show he could connect the new two-dimensional geometry with\ngeometry on a surface of constant negative curvature, but he did\nnothing with this observation.\n\nOn the other hand, the mere existence of formulae would not suffice to\nmake them geometrical in character. This need to give them a\ngeometrical grounding was recognised by Lobachevskii in his earliest\npublications, but being in Russian they were not read outside Russia\n(nor were they appreciated by Russian mathematicians). He dropped his\nconsiderations of this kind in his pamphlet of 1840, upon which much\nof his reputation depends to this day, but brought them back in his\nlast presentation, the Pang\u00e9om\u00e9trie (1856),\nwhich, however, did no better than the earlier versions.\n\nLobachevskii argued firstly that geometry was a science of bodies in\nspace, and that space is three-dimensional. The most primitive concept\nwas that of contact, and its opposite, a cut separating two bodies.\nTwo bodies not in contact are separated and a suitable third body in\ncontact with both of them measures the distance between them -- a\nconcept that was otherwise undefined. With it, however, he could\ndefine a sphere with its centre at a given point as the collection of\nall points equidistant from that given point. He then showed how to\ndefine a plane capturing the intuition that a plane is the collection\nof points in space that lie the same distance from two given points.\nIn his terms, given two points, a plane is the set of points common to\ntwo spheres of equal radius, one centred on one of the points and the\nother on the other. A line can be defined similarly using circles on\nthe same plane.\n\nWith the intuition that distance is the primitive concept comes a\ngreater appreciation of motion, or at least the results of being able\nto move objects around without altering them. One can imagine\ntransporting a rigid body around, say a cube with sides of unit\nlength, and using one of its sides to mark out lengths. We shall see\nlater that the possibilities inherent in this process occasioned a\nchicken-and-egg debate between Bertrand Russell and Henri\nPoincar\u00e9 at the end of the 19th century.\n\nThe new geometry posed a radical challenge to Euclidean geometry,\nbecause it denied traditional geometry its best claim to certainty, to\nwit, that it was the only logical system for discussing\ngeometry at all. It also exploited the tension known to experts\nbetween the concepts of straightest and shortest. But in other ways it\nwas conventional. It offered no new definitions of familiar concepts\nsuch as straightness or distance, it agreed with Euclidean geometry\nover angles, it merely offered a different behaviour of parallel lines\nbased on a difference in the distant behaviour of straight lines. Its\nproponents did not offer a sceptical conclusion. Bolyai and\nLobachevskii did not say: \u201cSee, there are two logical but\nincompatible geometries, so we can never know what is true.\u201d\nInstead, they held out the hope that experiments and observations\nwould decide. The epistemological price people would have to pay if\nastronomical observations had come down in favour of the new geometry\nwould, in a sense, have been slight: it would have been necessary to\nsay that straight lines have an unexpected property after all, but one\nonly detectable at very long distances. To be sure, many of the\ntheorems of geometry would then have to be reworked, and their\nfamiliar Euclidean counterparts would appear only as very good\napproximations. But that is broadly comparable to the situation\nNewtonian mechanics found itself in after the advent of special\nrelativity.\n",
