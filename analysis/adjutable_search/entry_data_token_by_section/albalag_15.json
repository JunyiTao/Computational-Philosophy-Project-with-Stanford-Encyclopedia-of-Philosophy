    "main_text": "Political Thought\n11. Conclusion\n\nSefer Tiqqun ha de\u02bfot represents a significant\ndevelopment in the domain of Jewish thought in particular and\nphilosophy in general. In a time when post-Maimonidean philosophers\nexerted efforts to enhance the philosophical-religious\nenterprise of Maimonides (as they understood Maimonides\u2019\nenterprise to be), Albalag highlights the shortcomings of that\nenterprise, advocating as an alternative the double truth doctrine. In\napplication, however, this doctrine is strikingly restricted to a very\nnarrow scope, while the superiority of philosophy as a source of true\nknowledge and certainty is made noticeable throughout the\nTiqqun. Unlike the religious domain in which truth is\nqualified by degrees, the ultimate of which being exclusively\naccessible to prophets, and subject to human interpretations, truth in\nthe philosophical domain is absolute. It can be obtained through\ndemonstrative reasoning and learned from Aristotelian sciences. It is\nthis understanding of philosophical truth that motivated Albalag to\nundertake scrutiny of the philosophical discourse in order to purge it\nfrom errors and reinstate correct Aristotelianism, as he understands\nit through the writings of Averroes, the Commentator. On the whole,\nAlbalag\u2019s enterprise marks an attempt to break away from\nsome of the major Neo-Platonic trends that had characterized the\nAvicennian-Farabian interpretation of Aristotle.\n",
