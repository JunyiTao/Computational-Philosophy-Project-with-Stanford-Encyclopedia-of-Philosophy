    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nDoctors are called on to deal with many states of affairs. Not all of\nthem, on any theory, are diseases. A doctor who prescribes\ncontraceptives or performs an abortion, for example, is not treating a\ndisease. Some women cannot risk pregnancy for health reasons, and\nhistorically both pregnancy and childbirth have been major killers.\nNevertheless,they are not disease states, and modern women typically\nuse contraception or abortion in the service of autonomy and control\nover their lives. In addition, it is very difficult to find a\nphilosophically or scientifically interesting cleavage between\ndiseases and other complaints (Reznek 1987, 71\u201373).\n\nOne dominant strand in modern medicine sees a disease as essentially a\nprocess that recurs across individuals in slightly different forms: a\ndisease is an abstract kind that is realized in different ways (Carter\n2003: Whitbeck 1977). But since a disease is a biological insult,\ndistinguishing it from injury is very difficult. Perhaps injuries are\nnot processes in the relevant sense but events. This essay assumes\nthat the conceptual issues raised by illnesses, injuries and other\nmedical conditions are similar enough to let us put this demarcation\nproblem aside. Disability is another important and neglected topic in\nhealth and well-being. It will be addressed here only slightly, since\nthe contemporary debates on disease and disability tend to go on in\nisolation from each other. Only rarely do authors such as Glackin\n(2010) tackle both. It is worth noting, though, that the disability\ndebate is typically framed in a way that closely resembles the debate\nover disease. Medical model adherents judge disability to be the\nproduct of a functional impairment or failure in human physiology.\nThis resembles what will be called below the naturalistic model of\ndisease, at least as regards assessment of bodily impairment. It\ncontends that people with disabilities, like people with diseases, are\nrendered worse off in virtue of these functional impairments, and the\nexplanatory burden of their disadvantage is borne chiefly by the\nfailure of their physiology or psychology to perform a natural\nfunction. A concept of disability as dysfunction has been resisted by\nrival pictures of disability that have made headway in recent\ndecades.\n\nAccording to the rival \u201csocial model\u201d, disability is not a\ndeparture from normal or healthy human functioning which makes an\natypical condition a \u201cbad difference\u201d from the norm;\nrather it is a \u201cmere difference\u201d (Barnes 2016). Although\ndisabilities may make people worse off in general, this is due to the\nway society is set up, rather than any physical impairment. Disability\nin itself is just variation, analogous to features like sexuality,\ngender and race. The social model was pushed by disability activists\nwho defined disability as \u201cthe disadvantage or restriction of\nactivity caused by a contemporary social organisation which takes\nlittle or no account of people who have physical impairments and thus\nexcludes them from participation in the mainstream of social\nactivities\u201d (UPIAS 1975, quoted in Shakespeare 2010). The\nscientific basis for this position appeals to the idea that \u201cthe\npartitioning of human variation into the normal versus the abnormal\nhas no firmer footing than the partitioning into races. Diversity of\nfunction is a fact of biology\u201d (Amundson 2000, p. 34). The\nresulting partition, it is held, is a reflection of social norms\nrather than underlying physical impairments. This position resembles\nwhat will here be termed the constructivist position with regard to\nhealth.\n\nHealth has received less philosophical attention than disease, and\nthis essay will correspondingly have less to say about it. The\nconceptual terrain in the case of health is a little more complex than\nthat of disease; one way of thinking about health says that it is just\nthe absence of disease, so if disease is biological malfunction or\nabnormality, it follows that a healthy person is someone whose\nbiological systems are all in order. But another way of looking at\nhealth insists that it is not just the absence of disease but the\npresence of something more; a positive state. The constitution of the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) defines health \u201ca state of\ncomplete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the\nabsence of disease or infirmity\u201d (WHO 1948). According to views\nlike this, we should think in terms not of health and disease alone,\nbut in terms of health, disease and normality. This essay will look at\ntheories of health after first discussing disease. The focus\nthroughout is on individuals, although some theorists (e.g. Inkpen\n2019) have argued for a seeing humans and their associated microbiomes\nas part of an ecosystem that can be evaluated, like other ecosystems,\nas healthy or not. \n",
