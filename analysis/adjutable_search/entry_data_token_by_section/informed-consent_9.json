    "main_text": "The idea of consent\n3. The idea of consent\n\nLet us now review the different elements of fully free and informed\nconsent in some detail, starting with the notion of consent itself.\nEnglish admits of both psychological and behavioral senses of consent.\nPsychologically, consent can designate \u201ca state of mind of\nacquiescence\u201d (Westen 2003, 5), and \u201can act of\nwill\u2014a subjective mental state\u2026\u201d (Hurd 1996, 121).\nBut the medical requirement of informed consent seems to include at\nleast some behavioral expression of consent (Kleinig 2010,\n9\u201310), ranging from a patient\u2019s signature, to her\nnot protesting when a nurse approaches with a syringe\n(so-called implicit or tacit consent). That said, the need for some\ncomprehension and voluntariness means that mental states also affect\nwhen consent legitimizes medical intervention, perhaps supporting a\nhybrid view of one sort (Miller and Wertheimer 2010, 84) or another\n(Alexander 2014).\n\nWhen emergency intervention is needed but normal consent cannot be\nobtained, say, because the patient is unconscious and neither she nor\nher family\u2019s specific preferences can be identified in time,\nproponents of informed consent often justify intervention by invoking\na potentially different form of consent. They say that presumed\nconsent obtains, even if actual and express consent does not.\nPresumed consent is also often invoked in order to legitimize a\ngeneral policy of harvesting organs from healthy deceased persons to\nuse in transplantation unless they explicitly indicated their\nopposition, and a similar general policy of testing all incoming\npatients for HIV except those who explicitly request not to be tested.\nSuch policies reverse the usual default assumptions about what is\npermissible and place the onus on any individual who has reservations,\nto \u201copt out.\u201d The underlying thought is that when opting\nout remains easy, so-called presumed consent is perfectly consonant\nwith patient sovereignty (Sunstein and Thaler 2008).\n\nSome authors oppose the terminology of presumed consent as a contrived\n\u201cmyth\u201d or \u201cfiction\u201d of actual consent (Harmon\n1990; Brownsword 2004, 232\u20133; Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 107;\nDworkin 1988, 117). They concede that when a nurse approaches a\npatient with a syringe, the patient\u2019s failure to protest\nconstitutes actual, albeit tacit, consent per convention. But they add\nthat it is fraudulent to presume consent when consent is not\nexplicitly given and no relevant convention specifies that silence\nexpresses consent.\n\nThis opposition seems to interpret \u201cpresumed consent\u201d\nascriptions as meaning: Presumably, the patient has given actual\n(albeit tacit) consent. The opponents seem right on point: it\ngoes too far to assume that, just because a patient fails to carry in\nher pocket a directive forbidding care or organ harvesting in the\nevent of an emergency or death, she is consenting. However, on a\ndifferent interpretation, presumed consent ascriptions mean:\nPresumably, the patient would have consented to the intervention\nif, under the current circumstances, she were\ndecisionally-capacitated. A possible ground for such\ncounterfactual ascriptions is that there is no special information\nthat indicates that the patient would not consent, and most people\nwould consent. This interpretation seems to sidestep the\ndifficulty.\n\nOf course, if opt-out organ procurement policies are justified, it is\nnot necessary that one justify them in terms of consent (presumed or\notherwise) as long as one is prepared to argue that sometimes, certain\nvalues defeat individuals\u2019 consent rights. In the case of organs\nfrom the deceased, the primary pull for making consent not refusal\ninto the default may well be the huge benefit to the organ recipient\nand the far lower harm to the deceased. Together, these factors may\nmake high-quality informed consent less urgent.\n",
