    "main_text": "Anti-Absolutism || The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction and Likeness of Meaning\n2.2 The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction and Likeness of Meaning\nGoodman did, however, considerably depart from the logical\npositivists in denying the comprehensibility of the analytic/synthetic\ndistinction. This rejection and Goodman\u2019s gradual account of synonymy\n(or, rather, likeness of meaning) developed out of an exchange of\nletters between Morton White, Quine, and Goodman, which is also the\nhistorical background of Quine\u2019s famous \u201cTwo Dogmas of\nEmpiricism\u201d (Quine 1951a).\nOn 25 May 1947, Morton White wrote a letter to Quine asking for\nadvice on a paper in which he tried to deal with a solution to C.H.\nLangford\u2019s paradox of analysis proposed by Alonzo Church. White was\nespecially unhappy with Church\u2019s invocation of abstract objects in\norder to explicate the notion of synonymy. White sent his\ndiscontentment with the proposed solution to Quine (White\u2019s original\npaper appeared in print in 1948 under the title \u201cOn the\nChurch\u2013Frege Solution of the Paradox of Analysis\u201d) and\nthen sent Quine\u2019s answer to Goodman. In 1947 the three discussed the\nmatter by letter, until White was eventually chosen to write a survey\nof their discussion, which appeared in 1950 under the title \u201cThe\nAnalytic and the Synthetic: An Untenable Dualism\u201d. Quine\npresented his view on the matter in an address to the American\nPhilosophical Association, which was published in 1951 as \u201cTwo\nDogmas of Empiricism\u201d (Quine 1951a).\nAt that time the postulation of new abstract objects, such as\nFregean senses or other intensional objects, in order to explicate a\ncertain notion of synonymy seemed an unacceptable move for someone\nwith nominalist leanings such as Quine and a purist such as White. For\nQuine, an explication of \u201csynonymy\u201d or\n\u201canalyticity\u201d and the like should rather be given in\nbehavioristic terms. The explication should tell us in what way\n\u201canalyticity\u201d and \u201csynonymy\u201d make a difference\nin speaker behavior. To learn that the difference lies in postulated\nabstract objects did not seem to explicate the notions in any\npromising way.\nGoodman\u2019s original discontentment with the whole situation was more\nserious. In a letter to White and Quine he claimed that not only did\nhe find the explications of \u201csynonymy\u201d and\n\u201canalyticity\u201d so far provided to be problematic, but he\ndid not even understand what these terms were supposed to mean\npre-theoretically:\n\nWhen I say I don\u2019t understand the meaning of \u201canalytic\u201d\nI mean that very literally. I mean that I don\u2019t even know how to apply\nthe terms. I do not accept the analogy with the problem of defining,\nsay, confirmation. I don\u2019t understand what confirmation is, or let us\nsay projectibility, in the sense that I can\u2019t frame any adequate\ndefinition; but give me any predicate and (usually) I can tell you\nwhether it is projectible or not. I understand the term in\nextension. But \u201canalytic\u201d I don\u2019t even understand this\nfar; give me a sentence and I can\u2019t tell you whether it is analytic\nbecause I haven\u2019t even implicit criteria\u2026. I can\u2019t look for a\ndefinition when I don\u2019t know what it is I am defining. (Goodman in a\nletter to Quine and White, 2 July 1947, in White 1999, 347)\n\nGoodman\u2019s remark is instructive, since it undermines a move that\nGrice and Strawson would later make against Quine\u2019s argumentation in\n\u201cTwo Dogmas of Empiricism\u201d. In their \u201cIn Defense of\na Dogma\u201d (Grice and Strawson 1956) they argue that Quine\u2019s\nskepticism about the analytic-synthetic distinction as such is\nundermotivated in light of our pre-theoretic grasp of the\ndistinction. Goodman\u2019s claim is that there in fact is no such\npre-theoretic grasp of the distinction.\nThe official result of the exchange between White, Goodman, and\nQuine was that any sharp analytic-synthetic distinction is\nuntenable and should just be abandoned:\n\nI think that the problem is clear, and that all considerations\npoint to the need for dropping the myth of a sharp distinction between\nessential and accidental predication (to use the language of the older\nAristotelians) as well as its contemporary formulation\u2014the sharp\ndistinction between analytic and synthetic. (White 1950, 330)\n\nGoodman\u2019s view on the matter had already appeared in print in 1949\nunder the title \u201cOn Likeness of Meaning\u201d. In this paper\nGoodman proposes a purely extensional analysis of meaning, the upshot\nof which is that no two different expressions in a language are\nsynonymous. He discusses several objections to theories of meaning\nthat rely on intensional entities (such as, for example, Fregean\nsenses) to explicate the notion of synonymy in non-circular ways, such\nthat the question of whether two terms are \u201csynonymous\u201d is\ncomprehensible as well as scrutable. Goodman eventually rejects\nintensional approaches and opts for an extensional theory for sameness\nof meaning. According to such an extensional theory, two expressions\nhave the same meaning if and only if they have the same\nextension. This criterion is certainly intelligible, but also\nscrutable; we can\ndecide by induction, conjecture, or other means\nthat two predicates have the same extension without knowing exactly\nall the things they apply to. (PP, 225)\nBut an extensional theory is, of course, not thereby free of\nproblems. Consider, for example, the expression \u201cunicorn\u201d\nand \u201ccentaur\u201d, which have the same extension (namely the\nnull-extension) but differ in meaning. Hence, whereas sameness of\nextension is a necessary condition for sameness of meaning, sameness\nof extension does not seem to be sufficient for sameness of meaning.\nGoodman proposes an extensional fix to this problem that gives\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for sameness of meaning. He\nobserves that although \u201cunicorn\u201d and \u201ccentaur\u201d\nhave the same extension, simply because of the trivial fact that they\ndenote nothing, \u201ccentaur-picture\u201d and\n\u201cunicorn-picture\u201d do have different extensions. Clearly,\nnot all centaur-pictures are unicorn-pictures and vice\nversa. Thus the flight to compounds makes an extensional\ncriterion possible:\n[I]f we call the extension of a predicate by\nitself its primary extension, and the extension of its compounds as\nsecondary extension, the thesis is as follows: Two terms have the same\nmeaning iff they have the same primary and secondary extensions. (PP,\n227)\n The primary extensions of \u201cunicorn\u201d\n and \u201ccentaur\u201d are the same (the null-extension), but\n their secondary extensions do differ: the compounds\n \u201cunicorn-picture\u201d and \u201ccentaur-picture\u201d\n differ in extension.\nIf we allow all kinds of compounds equally, we arrive immediately\nat the result that by our new criterion no two different expressions\nhave the same meaning. Consider the expressions \u201cbachelor\u201d\nand \u201cunmarried man\u201d: \u201cis a bachelor but not an\nunmarried man\u201d is a bachelor description that is not an\nunmarried-man description. Hence, by Goodman\u2019s criterion, the\nsecondary extensions of \u201cbachelor\u201d and \u201cunmarried\nman\u201d differ because the primary extensions of at least one of\ntheir compounds do. Since the same trick can be pulled with any two\nexpressions, Goodman is left with the result that no two different\nexpressions are synonymous, but he is ready to bite this bullet.\nP-descriptions that are not Q-descriptions are easy to construct for\nany P and Q (provided these are different terms) and\nthese constructions might well be relatively uninteresting. If only\nsuch uninteresting constructs are available to make a difference in\nsecondary extension, P and Q, despite being not strictly\nsynonymous, might be more synonymous than a pair of predicates for\nwhich we are able to find interesting compounds (as in the case of\n\u201ccentaur\u201d and \u201cunicorn\u201d). This turns sameness\nof meaning of different terms into likeness of meaning, and synonymy\nand analyticity into a matter of degree.\n\n",
