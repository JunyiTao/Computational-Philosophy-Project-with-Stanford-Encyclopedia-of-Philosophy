    "main_text": "Epistemology: Direct realism and the doctrine of immediate justification || Kum\u0101rila\u2019s development of a general epistemological doctrine\n2.2 Kum\u0101rila\u2019s development of a general epistemological doctrine\n\n\nDespite, however, \u015aabara\u2019s probably warranted confidence\nthat his interlocutors could never be in a position to show\nthat sentences regarding the post-mortem careers of Vedic practitioners\nare falsified, the burden of proof will surely be thought by most to\nremain on him. It is at this point, though, that Kum\u0101rila more\nconvincingly shifted, in effect, the burden of proof. His\nground-breaking approach to epistemology involves raising a\nsecond-order question about the doxastic practices we take to be\nreliable (about, that is, pram\u0101\u1e47as). Of any way of\nknowing, then, that might be thought relevant to the adjudication of a\nclaim such as \u015aabara\u2019s (and Kum\u0101rila recognized that it\nis strategically advantageous in this regard to focus especially on\nperception), Kum\u0101rila asks:\u00a0 does it have its status\nas epistemically reliable\u2014does it have, as\nKum\u0101rila puts it, its pr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya, or\n\u201cbeing\na pram\u0101\u1e47a\u201d\u2014\u201cintrinsically\u201d\n(svata\u1e25), or does it have this property only on account of something else (parata\u1e25)? What\nKum\u0101rila thus asks is whether any cognition\u2019s having the\nepistemic qualities in virtue of which it is to be reckoned a reliable\nwarrant\u2014truth-conduciveness, say, or the capacity to confer\njustification\u2014is something that obtains immediately, or\nwhether instead justification is necessarily mediated by one\u2019s having\nhigher-order reasons for confidence in one\u2019s first-order\ncognitions.\n\n\nThe locus classicus for Kum\u0101rila\u2019s argument here\nis verse 47 of the codan\u0101 s\u016btra chapter of the\n\u015alokav\u0101rttika:\u00a0 \u201cIt should be understood\nthat all pram\u0101\u1e47as\u2019 have the property of\nbeing pram\u0101\u1e47as intrinsically; for a capacity not\nalready existing by itself (svata\u1e25) cannot be produced\nby anything else.\u201d (All of the passages given here from\nKum\u0101rila and his commentators can be found in Arnold 2005,\n57\u2013114.)  The argument Kum\u0101rila concisely expresses here in\nverse form is straightforward but compelling: if it is thought that\nany cognition finally counts as a reliable warrant only insofar as it\ncan be demonstrated to be such (for example, by appeal to a subsequent\ncognition of the causes of the initial one), infinite regress ensues;\nfor the subsequent, justifying cognition would, as itself a cognition,\nsimilarly require justification, and so on. Or, as Kum\u0101rila here\nsuggests, if the initial cognition isn\u2019t credited with the\nintrinsic \u201ccapacity\u201d for conferring justification, then no\nfurther cognition could be able to bestow that, either\u2014unless,\nof course, the further cognition is itself credited with immediately\nhaving that capacity, in which case, why not simply allow this with\nrespect to the initial cognition? As Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\ncommentators like to put it, if it is thought that we must await\nsecond-order justification before thinking we are justified in\ncrediting first-order cognitions, then \u201cthe whole world would be\nblind.\u201d\n\n\nAmong Kum\u0101rila\u2019s guiding intuitions here is the commonsensical\nthought that radical skepticism is not a tenable idea\u2014that, in\nother words, it is to be presumed that we\nare, simply as a matter of empirical fact, already justified\nin believing a great deal, and that the task of epistemology is\ntherefore to consider what must be the case in order for that to make sense.\nThe thrust of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s argument can be brought out by\nbriefly contrasting this epistemological position with what\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas not unreasonably took to be the\ncharacteristically Buddhist position in this regard (with its being\nparticularly the thought of Buddhists like Dign\u0101ga and\nDharmak\u012brti that M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas targeted with their epistemological arguments). Against the kind of\ncommon-sense realism exemplified by proponents of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, these Buddhists were inclined to\nencourage wariness with regard to our ordinary epistemic intuitions;\nBuddhists, after all, are chiefly concerned to argue that we are\nmistaken in inferring (what is perhaps among our most unshakable\nconvictions) that our manifestly episodic cognitions are the states of\nan underlying self. To that end, Buddhists like Dign\u0101ga\nand Dharmak\u012brti privileged what they took to be the constitutively\nnonconceptual, perceptual awareness that ultimately discloses,\nthey take it, only fleeting particulars. Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s\nintuition in this regard was that it is especially in virtue of the\ncausally describable character of perception that it is thus to be\nprivileged, since on his view, the capacity to interact causally with\nother particulars is what distinguishes anything as really\nexistent. (This intuition means, among other things, that\nBuddhists would also attack the strong linguistic realism of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, since the kinds of abstract objects posited\nto make sense of language cannot be thought to have causal\nefficacy.)\n\n\nIn characterizing what he takes to be the Buddhist position with regard\nto the issues we are here scouting following Kum\u0101rila, the later\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka commentator P\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra\ninvokes these central commitments of Dharmak\u012brti to motivate a\ncase for the direction of explanation that M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas\nwould reverse:\u00a0 \u201cSince we see that there is cognition of\na jar that is sometimes based on a jar, and sometimes not\nbased on a jar, a jar cannot be ascertained only by that [i.e., only by\na cognition that seems to us to have a jar as its content].\nAccordingly, it must be ascertained that the arising of a cognition of\na jar really is based on a jar only after ascertainment that there is a\njar which really exists as the cause of that cognition, [which\nascertainment can be] based only on perception of pragmatic\nefficacy.\u201d This credibly represents Buddhists in the tradition of\nDign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti as holding that we reach epistemic\nbedrock only when we have \u201ccognition whose phenomenal content is\npragmatic efficacy\u201d (arthakriy\u0101nirbh\u0101sa\u1e43\nj\u00f1\u0101nam)\u2014that, in other words, it is reasonable\nto doubt whether things really are as represented in cognition until we\nhave arrived at the kind of awareness that is causally related to what\nit is of (as, for example, when one not only sees that there is a jar,\nbut actually carries water with it).\n\n\nThat is what it might look like to suppose, against\nthe M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, that the status of first-order\ncognitions as epistemically reliable should be thought to\nrequire demonstration with reference to something over and above the\ninitial cognitions. Against this, Kum\u0101rila argues that the problem with\nsuch an appeal is that the second-order awareness that the\nthing perceived is pragmatically efficacious is itself just another\ncognition. Kum\u0101rila would allow, then, that a subsequent\ncognition concerning pragmatic efficacy could count as a potential\nsource of falsification; the impossibility of carrying water with what\nhad seemed to be a jar would indeed count as overriding the previously\njustified belief that one had seen a jar. What he refuses, however, is the\nclaim that the cognition of pragmatic efficacy provides a fundamentally\ndifferent kind of justification than the initial cognition.\nConfidence, to the contrary, that pragmatic efficacy does\nprovide something more\u2014that it tells us, e.g., that an\ninitially justified belief is also true\u2014could\nonly be based on the presupposition that \u201cpragmatic\nefficacy\u201d is somehow more immediately available to awareness\nthan, say, a jar; but this begs precisely the question at issue, and\nKum\u0101rila can not unreasonably ask why the Buddhist is willing to\ncredit the second-order cognition as intrinsically valid, but not the\nfirst.\n",
