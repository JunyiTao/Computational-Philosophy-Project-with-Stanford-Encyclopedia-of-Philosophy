    "main_text": "Pyrrhonian Skepticism || Rejecting Premise 7: Positism\n5.4 Rejecting Premise 7: Positism\n\nOne position that can be traced back to some ideas in\nWittgenstein\u2019s On Certainty (Wittgenstein\n1969)\u2014and, perhaps, also to Ortega\u2019s Ideas y\nCreencias (Ortega y Gasset 1940)\u2014is that evidential chains\nhave to terminate in beliefs that are not properly said to be either\njustified or unjustified. This position, which we shall call\n\u201cPositism\u201d (not to be confused with\n\u201cpositivism\u201d), shares many features with Foundationalism:\nfor instance, both positists and foundationalists agree that\ninferential chains have to be finite and non-circular. But, whereas\nthe foundationalist thinks that the starting points of inferential\nchains are beliefs that are justified by something other than beliefs,\nthe positist thinks that the starting points of inferential chains are\nbeliefs that are not justified by anything\u2014they are posits that\nwe have to believe without justification. Despite this difference\nbetween the positist and the foundationalist, the positions are\nstructurally similar enough that analogues of the questions posed to\nthe foundationalist can be asked of the\n positist.[21]\n\nFirst, then, which beliefs are such that they are not justified and\nyet are the starting points of every inferential chain\u2014in other\nwords, how do we identify which are the posits? One answer that can be\ngleamed from Wittgenstein\u2019s On Certainty, which we will\ncall \u201crelativistic Positism\u201d, is that this is a matter\nthat is relative both to time and society, because what the posits are\nis determined by some function of the actual positing practices of the\nmembers of one\u2019s society at a certain time. Thus, according to\nWittgenstein, the proposition that no one has been to the moon was a\nposit for a certain long period of time\u2014it was a proposition\nthat no one felt the need to justify, and that was presupposed in many\njustificatory practices. For obvious reasons, though, that proposition\ncan no longer appropriately function as a posit. Other\nepistemologists, \u201cnon-relativistic positists\u201d, think that\nwhich beliefs are properly posited depends on some objective truth\nabout which beliefs have to be presupposed in order to engage in the\npractice of justifying beliefs at all. One prime candidate for playing\nthis role is the first-person belief that I am not being deceived by\nan evil demon into thinking that I am a normally embodied and situated\nhuman being (this is the view advocated by Wright 2004 that we already\nalluded to in section 3.2).\n\nThe second question, regarding how posits must be related to inferred\nbeliefs in order to justify them, can receive answers that are\ncompletely analogous to the foundationalists\u2019.\n\nThe third question, applied to positism, is the question why certain\nbeliefs are properly posited. Relativistic positists answer that this\nis so because of a certain societal fact: because they are taken to be\nso by an appropriate sub-sector of a certain society at a certain\ntime. Non-relativistic positists answer that a certain belief is\nproperly taken as a posit just in case every justificatory act that we\nengage in presupposes that the belief in question is true.\n\nOne objection that positists of both sorts have to face is that they\nare transforming a doxastic necessity into an epistemic\nvirtue\u2014that is, they are concluding that certain beliefs can\nproperly serve as the starting points of inferential chains because\nthat is how in fact they are treated (relativistic Positism) or\nbecause otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be possible to engage in\ninferential practices at all (non-relativistic Positism). The\nPyrrhonian skeptic, of course, will reply that the mere fact that most\nmembers of a society accept a certain belief without justification, or\neven the fact that if we don\u2019t do so then we cannot justify\nanything else, doesn\u2019t mean that it should be accepted without\njustification.\n",
