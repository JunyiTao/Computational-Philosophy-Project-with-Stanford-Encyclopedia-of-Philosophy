    "main_text": "Epistemology as \u201cThoroughly Empirical\u201d || Knowledge and Epistemology\n4.1 Knowledge and Epistemology\n\nUnlike Quine, Kornblith retains knowledge as a central epistemological\nnotion. However, his position departs dramatically from TE in how it understands the\nnature of epistemological investigation. Here, in both\nits proper target and its methods, epistemology is held not to be as\nTE and its practitioners portray them. As to the first, recall\n (Section 1.3)\n that a, if not the, central task of analytic epistemology following\nthe demise of logical empiricism was \u201cthe analysis of\nknowledge\u201d, by which was meant the attempt to provide an\nanalysis, typically in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions,\nof the concept of knowledge. (See, for instance, the various\npapers in the aforementioned Roth and Galis volume.) Against this, it\nis suggested that the concept of knowledge is of little if any\ntheoretical interest; it is no more the proper target of\nepistemological theory than the concept of aluminum is a\nworthy target of inquiry for one trying to understand various metals.\nLikely, Kornblith says, our concept of knowledge is defective in\nvarious ways anyway. (For example, in spite of its now near-universal\nrejection among epistemologists, the idea that knowledge required\ncertainty enjoyed the favor of many, and is arguably still attractive\namong many non-philosophers.) What epistemologists should\nseek is \u201cto provide an account of a certain natural phenomenon,\nnamely, knowledge itself\u201d (1999: 161). \u201cIt is the\ninvestigation of knowledge as a phenomenon in the world\u201d, he\nwrites, \u201cwhich distinguishes naturalism from other approaches to\nknowledge\u201d (1995: 245).\n\nAs to method, the epistemologist should proceed as would our imagined\nmetallurgist: we begin by examining apparently clear cases of\nknowledge, and look to find what they have in common. Part of what\nhappens here, very likely, is that we will reclassify some of these\nexamples along the way. What emerges, however, is a picture of the\ntrue nature of knowledge. Specifically, and as is evident in the work\nof cognitive ethologists in particular\u2014that is, those whose job\nit is to study intelligent animal behavior\u2014what emerges is an\nessentially reliabilist picture, in which knowledge consists in\n\n\ntrue beliefs that are reliably produced, that are instrumental\nin the production of behavior successful in meeting biological needs\nand thereby implicated in the Darwinian explanation of the selective\nretention of traits. (Kornblith 2002: 62)\n\n\nKnowledge, on this view, is a natural kind, one that\u2019s realized\nin both human and non-human animals. It has a particular nature, and a\nparticular causal-explanatory role in our general understanding of the\nlife and success of certain types of biological organisms. In better\nunderstanding that place, and through an empirical investigation of\n\n\n\nthe various mechanisms of belief production and retention, we may\ndetermine where we are most in need of guidance, and what steps can be\ntaken, given our capabilities, to overcome our shortcomings.\n(Kornblith 1999: 163; on NE and epistemic improvement, see too\nKornblith\u2019s 1994b)\n\n\nSo, both at the stage of understanding the worldly epistemological\ntarget, and in recommending possible improvements to our epistemic\nstrategies, \u201ca proper naturalistic epistemology is empirical all\nthe way down\u201d (Kornblith 1995: 243). While epistemology thus has\nno distinctive method, there is a sense, Kornblith thinks, in\nwhich it retains its autonomy:\n\n\nQuestions about knowledge and justification, questions about theory\nand evidence, are...legitimate questions, and they are ones in which\nphilosophy has a special stake\u2026.If the autonomy of a discipline\nconsists in dealing with a distinctive set of questions, or in\napproaching certain phenomena with a distinctive set of concerns, then\nphilosophy is surely an autonomous discipline. There is no danger that\nthese questions and concerns will be somehow co-opted by other\ndisciplines. (Kornblith 2002: 26)\n\n",
