    "main_text": "Models of scientific reduction in the philosophy of science || Structuralist models of reduction\n2.4 Structuralist models of reduction\n\nOne alleged problem of Nagelian models is that they start from a\nmistaken background view of science in that they conceive of theories\nas syntactic objects and rely on dubious notions about the nature of\nlaws and theoretical terms. Structuralists tried to overcome these\nalleged problems (as well as others, such as the problem of\nincommensurability) by revising the notion of a theory.\n\nPart of the classical structuralist program consists in the idea that\nphilosophy of science, properly construed, pursues an ideal of\nrational reconstruction of science (cf. Stegm\u00fcller 1979; Balzer\n1984: 331), which is to be understood as a reconstruction of actual\nscientific developments. Since it is common knowledge that cases of\nstraightforward reductions are rare, if they exist at all,\nstructuralists focused primarily on cases of mere replacement or on\nsimilarities between theories, which are cashed out in terms of\napproximation or (semantic counterparts of) derivation under ideal\nconditions (Moulines 1984; Scheibe 1999; Stegm\u00fcller 1979 &\n1986: ch. 4).\n\nAccording to the structuralist picture (Sneed 1971; further developed\nin: Stegm\u00fcller 1979), to give an account of a theory T is\nto define the predicate \u2018_is a (model of) T\u2019 in\nset-theoretical terms. A theory basically consists of a set M,\na set of potential models MP, a set of potential partial models\nMPP and a set of intended applications I, which is\nsupposed to be \u201copen\u201d, or non-extensionally individuated.\nThe relation between the different variants or stages of I is,\nas Stegm\u00fcller suggests, best thought of as being pragmatically\nfixed (Stegm\u00fcller 1979). Building on such a notion of a theory,\nPatrick Suppes proposes the following characterization of inter-theory\nreduction:\n\n\nMany of the problems formulated in connection with the question of\nreducing one science to another may be formulated as a series of\nproblems using the notion of a representation theorem for the models\nof a theory. For instance, the thesis that psychology may be reduced\nto physiology would be for many people appropriately established if\none could show that, for any model of a psychological theory, it was\npossible to construct an isomorphic model within physiological theory.\n(Suppes 1967: 59)\n\n\nThese set-theoretical structures are then used to define a reduction\nrelation in terms of mapping functions from one structure to another.\nIt is worth noting, however, that structuralists believed their models\nof reduction to be advantageous because they believed their\nconcept of a theory to be more appropriate. The general status of\nstructuralism is an important factor in assessing the problems these\nmodels of reduction seem to face.\n",
