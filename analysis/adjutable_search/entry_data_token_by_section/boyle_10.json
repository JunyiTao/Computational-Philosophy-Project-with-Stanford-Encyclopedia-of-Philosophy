    "main_text": "Boyle\u2019s Law\n5. Boyle\u2019s Law\n\nMany of us learned at school that Boyle\u2019s Law holds for ideal\ngases and can be summarized as \\(PV = k,\\) where \\(k\\) is a constant, and \\(P\\)\nand \\(V\\) are pressure and volume respectively. This law does stem from\nBoyle\u2019s work, but it is not what Boyle took himself to have\n demonstrated.[51]\n\nBoyle was arguing specifically against a Jesuit scientist, Franciscus\nLinus, who claimed, not that ordinary atmospheric air does not have\nany pressure (a spring), but that its pressure was not sufficiently\npowerful for it to do all the things it does in fact do. So Boyle\ndecided on an experiment to show the way in which, as we would say,\nthe pressure and the volume of the air vary, when the air is, in\nBoyle\u2019s words, either \u2018compressed or dilated.\u2019\n\nHe and his assistant, at the time Robert Hooke, made a J shaped tube\nand began to make a few measurements, but \u201cwere hindered from\nprosecuting the trial at that time by the casual breaking of the\ntube.\u201d\n\nSubsequently they made another, larger, better piece of apparatus, and\ntaking particular care that the measurements should be accurate,\ntested the hypothesis \u201cthat supposes the pressures and\nexpansions to be in reciprocal proportion.\u201d The results are set\nout, with misprints, in two tables, and Boyle\u2019s conclusion was\nthat the experimental findings matched the predicted results very well\nin the case of compression, less well in the case of rarefaction.\nBoyle suggested that the divergence from the expected result in the\ncase of rarefaction may have been due to \u201csome little aerial\nbubbles in the quicksilver\u201d (\u201cso easy is it in such nice\nexperiments to miss of exactness,\u201d he added).\n\nNow, what did Boyle take himself to have shown? First, that there is,\nas a matter of experimental fact, a spring to the air: this is not in\nthe sense in which Boyle understands the term, any longer an\nhypothesis: it is now obvious from the experimental results: what\nexplains, or purports to explain this fact will be a theory or an\nhypothesis, but the result itself is in no sense an hypothesis. As\nBoyle said\n\n\u2026to determine whether the motion of restitution in bodies\nproceed from this, that the parts of a body of a peculiar structure\nare put into motion by the bending of the spring, or from the\nendeavour of some subtle ambient body, whose passage may be opposed or\nobstructed, or else its pressure unequally resisted by reason of the\nnew shape or magnitude, which the bending of a spring may give the\npores of it seems to me a matter of more difficulty, than at first\nsight one would easily imagine it. Wherefore I shall decline meddling\nwith a subject, which is much more hard to be explicated than\nnecessary to be so by him, whose business it is not \u2026 to assign\nthe adequate cause of the spring of the air, but only to manifest,\nthat the air hath a spring, and to relate some of its effects (BW,\n1:166, Birch 1772, I:12).\n\n\nSecondly, Boyle takes himself to have shown that, for atmospheric air,\nwithin the limits of his experimental set-up, \u201cthe pressures and\nexpansions [are] in reciprocal proportion,\u201d or, as we would say,\npressure and volume vary inversely. He doesn\u2019t take himself to\nhave shown anything more than this. He does remark that further\nexperiments may show that the relationship holds outside the boundary\nconditions imposed by the experimental set-up, but the experiments he\nhas just made certainly don\u2019t show that. What Boyle expressly\nsaid was,\n\ntill further trial hath more clearly informed me, I shall not venture\nto determine, whether or no the intimated theory will hold universally\nand precisely, either in condensation of air, or rarefaction: all that\nI shall now urge being, that\u2026the trial already made\nsufficiently proves the main thing, for which I here allege it; since\nby it, it is evident, that as common air, when reduced to half its\nwonted extent, obtained near about twice as forcible a spring as it\nhad before, so this thus comprest air being further thrust into half\nthis narrow room, obtained thereby a spring about as strong again as\nthat it last had, and consequently four times as strong as that of the\ncommon air (BW, 3:60, Birch 1772, I:159).\n\n\nThus Boyle\u2019s Law, for Boyle, was not a universal generalization\nabout ideal gases: it was a strictly limited claim about common or\natmospheric air. Boyle did add that \u201cthere is no cause to doubt,\nthat if we had been here furnished with a greater quantity of\nquicksilver and a very strong tube, we might, by a further compression\nof the included air, have made it counter balance the pressure of a\nfar taller and heavier cylinder of mercury.\u201d\n\nBut he did not claim that the same ratio between pressure and volume\nwould hold in such more extreme cases. Nor did he claim that there are\nno limits to the possible compression. It is worth stressing that\nBoyle had this limited view of his result, for Shapin and Schaffer\n1985 suggest that\n\nThe work Boyle undertook in reply to Linus was \u2026 done \u2026\nwith a specially constructed J-shaped tube in which pressures higher\nthan atmospheric could be attained. Using this apparatus Boyle showed\nthat if he compressed air twice as strongly as usual he could produce\ntwice as strong a spring. He concluded that the process could go on\nindefinitely, so that there were no limits to the power of the\nair\u2019s spring (Shapin and Schaffer 1985, 168\u20139).\n\n\nBut Boyle was quite happy not to draw such conclusions, simply because\nhis experiments didn\u2019t allow that kind of jump. There are other\nimportant ways in which he thought that generalizations about nature\nmight fail of universality. He had a very healthy notion of the\ncomplexity of the world, and an acute sense of the difficulties to\nwhich even apparently simple experiments could give rise. In fact,\nBoyle had was one of the first philosophers ever to develop a\nphilosophy of experiment.\n",
