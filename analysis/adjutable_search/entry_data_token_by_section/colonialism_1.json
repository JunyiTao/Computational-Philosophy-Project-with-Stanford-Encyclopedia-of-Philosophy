Natural Law and the Conquest of the Americas\n\nThe Spanish conquest of the Americas sparked a theological, political,\nand ethical debate about the use of military force to acquire control\nover foreign lands. This debate took place within the framework of a\nreligious discourse that legitimized military conquest as a way to\nfacilitate the conversion and salvation of indigenous peoples. The\nidea of a \u201ccivilizing mission\u201d was by no means the\ninvention of the British in the nineteenth century. The Spanish\nconquistadores and colonists explicitly justified their activities in\nthe Americas in terms of a religious mission to bring Christianity to\nthe native peoples. The Crusades provided the initial impetus for\ndeveloping a legal doctrine that rationalized the conquest and\npossession of lands that were held by non-Christians. Whereas the\nCrusades were initially framed as defensive wars to reclaim Christian\nlands that had been conquered, the resulting theoretical innovations\nplayed an important role in subsequent attempts to justify the\nconquest of the Americas. The core claim was that the \u201cPetrine\nmandate\u201d to care for the souls of Christ\u2019s human flock\nrequired Papal jurisdiction over temporal as well as spiritual\nmatters, and this control extended to non-believers as well as\nbelievers.\n\nThe conversion of the native peoples, however, did not provide an\nunproblematic justification for the project of overseas conquest. The\nSpanish conquest of the Americas was taking place during a period of\nreform when humanist scholars within the Church were increasingly\ninfluenced by the natural law theories of theologians such as St.\nThomas Aquinas. According to Pope Innocent IV, war could not be waged\nagainst infidels and they could not be deprived of their property\nsimply because of their non-belief. Under the influence of Thomism,\nInnocent IV concluded that force was legitimate only in cases where\ninfidels violated natural law. Nonbelievers had legitimate dominion\nover themselves and their property, but this dominion was abrogated if\nthey proved incapable of governing themselves according to principles\nthat every reasonable person would recognize. The Spanish quickly\nconcluded that the habits of the native Americans, from nakedness to\nunwillingness to labor to alleged cannibalism, clearly demonstrated\ntheir inability to recognize natural law. This account of native\ncustoms was used to legitimize the enslavement of the Indians, which\nthe Spanish colonists insisted was the only way to teach them\ncivilization and introduce them to Christianity.\n\nSome of the Spanish missionaries sent to the New World, however,\nnoticed that the brutal exploitation of slave labor was widespread\nwhile any serious commitment to religious instruction was absent.\nMembers of the Dominican order in particular noted the hypocrisy of\nenslaving the indigenous peoples because of their alleged barbarity\nwhile practicing a form of conquest, warfare, and slavery that reduced\nthe indigenous population of Hispaniola from 250,000 to 15,000 in two\ndecades of Spanish rule. Given the genocidal result of Spanish\n\u201ccivilization,\u201d they began to question the idea of a\ncivilizing mission. Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas and Franciscus de\nVictoria were two of the most influential critics of Spanish colonial\npractice. Victoria gave a series of lectures on Indian rights that\napplied Thomism to the practice of Spanish rule. He argued that all\nhuman beings share the capacity for rationality and have natural\nrights that stem from this capacity. From this premise, he deduced\nthat the Papal decision to grant Spain title to the Americas was\nillegitimate. Unlike the position of Pope Innocent IV, Victoria argued\nthat neither the Pope nor the Spaniards could subjugate the Indians in\norder to punish violations of natural law, such as fornication or\nadultery. He noted that the Pope had no right to make war on\nChristians and take their property simply because they were\n\u201cfornicators or thieves.\u201d If this were the case, then no\nEuropean king\u2019s dominion would ever be safe. Furthermore,\naccording to Victoria, the pope and Christian rulers acting on his\nmandate had even less right to enforce laws against unbelievers,\nbecause they were outside of the Christian community, which was the\ndomain of Papal authority (Williams 1990).\n\nDespite this strongly worded critique of the dominant modes of\njustifying Spanish conquest, Victoria concluded that the use of force\nin the New World was legitimate when Indian communities violated the\nLaw of Nations, a set of principles derivable from reason and\ntherefore universally binding. At first it might sound contradictory\nthat the Indians\u2019 supposed violation of the natural law did not\njustify conquest but their violation of the Law of Nations, itself\nderived from natural law, did. Victoria emphasizes that the Law of\nNations is binding because \u201cthere exists clearly enough a\nconsensus of the greater part of the whole world\u201d (391) and\nbecause the principles benefit \u201cthe common good of all.\u201d\nThis distinction seems to rely on the assumption that other principles\nusually associated with natural law (such as the prohibitions on\nadultery and idolatry) only affect those who consent to the practices,\nwhereas violations of the Law of Nations (e.g. prohibitions on\npeaceful travel and trade) have consequences for those who do not\nconsent. Ultimately, Victoria\u2019s understanding of the Law of\nNations led him to defend the practice of Spanish colonialism, even\nthough he emphasized that warfare should be limited to the measures\nrequired to attain the legitimate objectives of peaceful trade and\nmissionary work. Within Victoria\u2019s critique of the legality and\nmorality of Spanish colonialism was a rationalization for conquest,\nalbeit a restrictive one.\n",
