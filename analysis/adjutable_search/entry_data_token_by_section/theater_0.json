    "main_text": "Philosophy of Theater, Historical Diversity of Theatrical Traditions, and the \u201cAnti-Theatrical Prejudice\u201d || The Historical Diversity of Theatrical Traditions\n1.1 The Historical Diversity of Theatrical Traditions\n\nAlthough some of the following contrasts have more to do with the\nmeans of theater than with its ends, the point is that, historically,\ntheater never has had just one form.\n\nTheater might be thought of as singular and unified. One reason for\nbelieving this has to do with the phenomenon known as \u201cthe\nanti-theatrical prejudice\u201d, an animus towards theater that has\nbeen expressed by philosophers and theologians as well as theater\ntheorists and practitioners (and that is more fully described in\n \u00a71.3).\n While it has been alleged by some that distrust of theater practices\nis present in every culture, Jonas Barish, who coined the phrase\n\u201cthe anti-theatrical prejudice\u201d, does not claim this kind\nof ubiquity. The idea that it is ubiquitous may be mere speculation\nand not based on any historical evidence. If it is not a universal, it\nrepresents a preoccupation arising in only one of the four regions of\nthe globe in which theater originated as a distinct set of social\npractices aimed at portraying aspects of human life.\n\nOther traditions appear to have originated in ways that are\ndistinguishable from European theater (which originated in Athens).\nThe African (Yoruba) tradition of theater emerged initially from\nmasquerades celebrating ancestors (Adedeji 1969, 1972). Yet some\ntraditions seem to have arrived fully formed: the Sanskrit\nTreatise on Theatre (Natya Shastra, Ghosh (trans)\n1951) offers, at a very early time (somewhere between 200 BCE and 200\nCE), a reasonably complete list of topics any treatise on theater that\nis focused on dramatics should include (acting, dance, music, dramatic\nconstruction, architecture, costuming, make-up, props, the\norganization of theater companies, the nature of audiences, theater\ncompetitions, and so on) (Schwartz 2004). Unlike Athenian theater, and\nits legend about the first actor, Thespis, human actors were not\nalways the first evidence of theater. The early form of theater in the\nHan Dynasty in China consisted largely of shadow-puppet theater. The\nmuch later Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907) is most famous for developing\na form of theater that would be recognizable to Europeans as\ntheater, were it not for the fact it was largely musical.\n\nThe diversity of theatrical forms is also revealed by the study of\ntheatrical performances and their literatures that arose at different\ntimes within Japan. The oldest form is Noh theater (originating around\n1300 and continuing to the present), which can be characterized not\nonly by having different aims than its, possibly Chinese, predecessor\nform, but also by being largely dependent on its performers being\nproficient in either pantomime or vocal acrobatics or both. Bunraku,\nin contrast (originating around the mid-1500s and still being\nperformed), is a form of theater that consists of large puppets with\nvisible puppeteers dressed in black to imply invisibility,\nwith the dialogue spoken by a single person who uses extensive vocal\ntechnique and range to present the language and expression of the\ndifferent characters. Kabuki theater (beginning at the end of the\n1500s) is also distinguishable from Noh theater, if not in subject\nmatter (most of its subject matter comes from Noh or Bunraku theater),\nthen in form because it employs dance, singing, pantomime, as well as\nphysical acrobatics. Even more distinctive\u2014and as distant from\nthese predecessors as one can imagine\u2014is Butoh (originating\nafter World War II) that includes dance, performance, and abstract\nmovement, in the service of challenges to public authority by means of\npresenting grotesque imagery, \u201cforbidden\u201d topics, as well\nas absurd environments and situations. Butoh is performed in white\nmake-up and may be purely conceptual, having no movement at all.\n",
