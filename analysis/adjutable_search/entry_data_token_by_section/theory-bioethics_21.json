    "main_text": "Moral Theory and Clinical Bioethics || Clinical Ethics and Moral Theory\n8. Conclusion\n\nWhat is the relation between moral theory and bioethics? There is no\nstraightforward answer to this question. So much depends upon whether\nwe consider bioethics in its academic, clinical, or policy-oriented\ninstantiations. And further, there is wide variance in what we have in\nmind when we talk about moral theory. Besides this, the very\ndistinction between moral theory, on the hand, and the problems and\nissues to be addressed in the practical realm, on the other, has been\ncalled into serious question. Still and all, it is difficult to\nimagine bioethics (in any form) in the total absence of moral theory.\nEspecially if modestly conceived as a set of substantive organizing\nassumptions about morality, and a commitment to a certain approach to\nmoral reasoning, it is difficult to view moral theory as anything\nother than indispensable to bioethics.\n",
