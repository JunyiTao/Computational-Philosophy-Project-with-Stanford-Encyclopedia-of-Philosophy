    "main_text": "Toward the Aufbau || Beginnings\n2.1 Beginnings\n\nCarnap was born on 18 May 1891 in the small town of Ronsdorf, now part\nof Wuppertal, an industrial city near the Ruhr area of northwestern\nGermany. His mother was a schoolteacher, and her father, Friedrich\nWilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld (1824\u201393), had been a leading educator and\neducational thinker in the Herbartian tradition. Carnap was\nhome-schooled by his mother until secondary school, and brought up\nreligious, but the emphasis was on the ethical, rather than the\ndoctrinal, dimensions of religious life. As a result, Carnap said, he\nhad no crisis of conscience when he later abandoned any belief in God\nor the supernatural. In 1908 the family moved to Jena, into the house\nof another famous relative, Carnap\u2019s maternal uncle Wilhelm\nD\u00f6rpfeld (son of Friedrich Wilhelm), a well-known and highly\ninfluential archaeologist. Carnap made trips to Greece with his uncle\nduring this time. He subsequently finished secondary school in Jena\nand enrolled in the university there, studying philosophy, physics,\nand mathematics, vaguely intending to become a high-school science\nteacher.\n\nAt the University of Jena he soon encountered the \u201cSera\nCircle\u201d, an offshoot of the Youth Movement that swept Germany in\nthe years before World War I. He became enthralled with the idea, as\nhe later said, that social forms and behavioral standards did not have\nto be assimilated uncritically from the surrounding society, or from\ntradition, but could be freely invented. The \u201cvoluntarism\u201d\nthat suffuses every phase of his later philosophical career (Jeffrey\n1992) seems to have had its origins here. He became not only an\nenthusiastic participant in the Youth Movement but also a leader,\nrepresenting the Jena branch at the climactic national meeting of\nlocal Youth Movement groups at the Hoher Mei\u00dfner in 1913 (Werner\n2003).\n\nCarnap\u2019s first exposure to logic came from an obscure and\nreclusive professor of mathematics at Jena, Gottlob Frege. Carnap was\nso fascinated that he took every course Frege offered (including two\ncourses on Frege\u2019s Begriffsschrift and a course on Logic in\nMathematics). His resulting shorthand notes are sufficiently detailed\nto permit a reconstruction of Frege\u2019s response after the system\nof the Grundgesetze had been undermined by Russell\u2019s\nparadox (Reck & Awodey 2005). It would be another decade, though,\nbefore Carnap came to see Frege\u2019s logic as the key to a new way\nof doing philosophy. Carnap also studied with neo-Kantians and\nLebensphilosophen, including Bruno Bauch (whose course on\nKant\u2019s First Critique left a lasting impression), Herman Nohl (a\nstudent of Dilthey) and\u2014while in Freiburg for a\nsemester\u2014Heinrich Rickert, whose lectures Carnap was\nparticularly enthusiastic about.\n\nThe war interrupted this development. Carnap and his Youth Movement\nfriends, though hardly enthralled, felt they could not shirk their\nduty to serve. Carnap spent most of 1914\u201317 at the front (first\nthe eastern, then the western), and took part in some of the bloodiest\nengagements. In 1917 he was wounded, awarded the Iron Cross, and spent\nthe remainder of the war at a radio research facility in Berlin. He\nalso became politically active: he joined the (by then anti-war)\nIndependent Socialist Party, circulated excerpts from the world press,\nmostly critical of the German government, to friends with his comments\n(Werner 2015), and participated in the transformation of the Youth\nMovement (or parts of it) into a political force. He teamed up with\nKarl Bittel, another Youth Movement leader, to start the underground\nPolitical Circular, a newsletter for university Youth\nMovement adherents that appeared irregularly during the months\nimmediately preceding the German Revolution of 1918. In the first\nissue, Carnap reviewed two books on proposals for worldwide political\nunion (Carnap 1918a). He also prepared for publication a much longer\nand more detailed analysis of the entire political situation following\nGermany\u2019s military defeat, but the Revolution occurred just as\nit was to be published, and it never appeared. (See the editors\u2019\nintroduction to Carnap 2019; it has now been published, along with\nother early Carnap manuscripts, in Damb\u00f6ck, Sandner, & Werner\nforthcoming.)\n\nCarnap\u2019s newfound political orientation was a non-Marxist\nlibertarian socialism of a kind represented by Gustav Landauer\n(1870\u20131919), a writer much admired by both Bittel and Carnap\n(Carnap 1919: 124, as described in Carus 2007a: 59). What is most\nstriking about Carnap\u2019s unpublished analysis of the German\nsituation after the defeat, though, is how unpolitical it\nremains, in any literal sense. He certainly deplores the unwillingness\nof educated Germans to dirty their hands with politics, and urges a\nfundamental change in attitude, balancing the exclusive German\nemphasis on the contemplative life with greater involvement in the\nactive life. However, what Carnap calls \u201cpolitics\u201d in this\nanalysis is \u201ceverything\u2026 that has some connection with\nthe public social life of people\u201d\u2014which, as he makes quite\nexplicit, includes practically all human activities, including some\nvery ivory-tower ones. Indeed, the key to his advocacy of greater\n\u201cpolitical involvement\u201d is that he assigns intellectual\nwork a central and indispensable role in arriving at the \u201cform\nof community [Gemeinschaftsgestalt]\u201d that could serve\nto coordinate the vast and heterogeneous multitude of tasks and jobs\nthat have \u201csome connection with the public social life of\npeople\u201d. Only by virtue of such a \u201cform of\ncommunity\u201d can we hope to remove this otherwise anarchic hive of\nactivities \u201cfrom the realm of chaotic whim and subordinate them\nto goal-oriented reason\u201d [\u201cder choatischen\nWillk\u00fcr zu entziehen und der zielbewu\u00dften Vernunft zu\nunterwerfen\u201d] (Carnap 1918b: 17\u201318, translated and\nquoted in Carus 2007a: 63).\n",
