Introduction\n\nCompared with more widely discussed attitudes like belief and desire,\nthe phenomenon of hope presents some unique challenges for both\ntheories of the mind and theories of value. Hope is not only an\nattitude that has cognitive components\u2014it is responsive to facts\nabout the possibility and likelihood of future events. It also has a\nconative component\u2014hopes are different from mere expectations\ninsofar as they reflect and draw upon our desires. A classic analysis\nof hope\u2014the so-called \u201cstandard account\u201d (see\n section 3)\u2014takes\n hope to be a compound attitude, consisting of a desire for an outcome\nand a belief in that outcome\u2019s possibility. But not all outcomes\nthat we believe to be possible and that we desire are thereby objects\nof our hope. In order to hope one not only has to consider an outcome\npossible, one also has to affectively engage with this outcome in a\ndistinctive way. This raises the question as to whether hope can be\nreduced to beliefs and desires.\n\nPopular discourse often takes hope to be synonymous with optimism. But\nwhile optimism can be usefully analyzed as a desire for an outcome\ntogether with a belief that the outcome is more likely than not (or\nmore likely than the evidence leads other people to believe), many\nphilosophers hold that hope, properly understood, is independent of\nprobability assessments (see\n section 3).\n One can hope for outcomes that one considers to be very unlikely and\nthat one does not expect to happen, such as a miraculous cure of an\nillness. In such cases, optimism is not an appropriate response.\n\nIt is an open question whether the contribution of hope to human\nagency is to be identified with that of the underlying desires or\nwhether hope makes an independent contribution to motivation or\nreasoning. If one assumes that hope cannot make any independent\ncontribution to practical reasoning but still motivates, this raises\nthe suspicion that it distorts rational agency. While such an\nassessment can be found across the history of philosophy, many past\nand contemporary philosophers provide analyses of hope that add\nfurther elements to the belief-desire analysis and use these elements\nto explain why acting on one\u2019s hopes is (sometimes)\nrational.\n2. The Philosophical History of Hope\n\nHistorically, evaluations of hope change together with the prevailing\nview of the relationship between human action and the future. As long\nas the human condition is seen as essentially unchangeable, hope is\nmore often treated as arising from mere epistemic uncertainty and as\nhaving ambivalent effects on human happiness. In philosophical\ncontexts where either the possibility of a future life beyond this\nworld or the idea of human progress is emphasized, hope is more often\nseen as an appropriate and even virtuous attitude that enables humans\nto direct their agency towards these possibilities (see Miceli and\nCastelfranchi 2010).\n2.1 Ancient Accounts of Hope\n\nAlthough there are few explicit and systematic treatments of hope\n(elpis) in ancient Greek philosophies, they nevertheless\ncontain important approaches to the nature of hope and its role in the\ngood life and practical deliberation (Gravlee 2020). Ambivalent\nevaluations of hope can be found in many texts. On the one hand, hope\nis often seen as an attitude of those who have insufficient knowledge\nor are easily swayed by wishful thinking. It thus has a negative\nreputation (Vogt 2017) as an attitude that (at least potentially)\nmisleads actions and agents. Even Solon focuses on empty hopes (see\nLewis 2006: 85; Caston and Kaster 2016). On the other hand, hope is\npraised as a response to despair, e.g., in the dialogues of\nThucydides, who advances a nuanced view of the potential dangers and\nadvantages of hope (Schlosser 2013). An ambivalent evaluation of hope\nis also reflected in Hesiod\u2019s version of the tale of Pandora.\nWhen all the evils had escaped from Pandora\u2019s jar, famously,\nonly hope (elpis) remained (\u201cWorks and Days\u201d,\n\u00a790). This seems to suggest that hope can also sustain human agency\nin the face of widespread evil. It must be noted, however, that there\nare many competing interpretations of why elpis remained in\nthe jar (Verdenius 1985): Was it to keep hope available for humans or,\nrather, to keep hope from humankind? Is hope consequently to be regarded as\ngood (\u201ca comfort to man in his misery and a stimulus rousing his\nactivity\u201d, Verdenius 1985: 66) or as evil (\u201cidle hope in\nwhich the lazy man indulges when he should be working honestly for his\nliving\u201d, Verdenius 1985: 66)? These different interpretations of\nPandora\u2019s myth are taken up throughout the history of Philosophy\n(especially among existentialist authors, see\n section 2.5).\n\nIn Plato\u2019s dialogues, we find negative as well as positive\nassessments of hope. In particular, Plato even argues that hope can be\nrational. In the Timaeus, Plato adopts a rather negative\nattitude towards hope by recounting a myth according to which the\ndivine beings give us \u201cthose mindless advisers confidence and\nfear, (\u2026) and gullible hope\u201d (Timaeus, 69b). In the\nPhilebus, by contrast, he seems to also allow for a more\nfavorable view of the role of hope in human life. The relevant\ndiscussion of hope takes place in the context of an argument about\n\u201cfalse pleasures\u201d. Against Protarch\u2019s objection that\nonly opinions can be true or false, but not pleasures, Socrates\ndevelops an analogy between opinion and pleasure (Philebus,\n36d). In this context, he describes \u201cpleasures of\nanticipation\u201d, that is, expectations of future pleasures, that\nare called hopes (Philebus, 39e3). As Frede (1985) argues, in\nthe case of such pleasures of anticipation what we enjoy at present is\nonly a thought. As there can be a discrepancy between the thought that\nwe enjoy and what is in fact going to happen, the pleasure can be\ntrue\u2014in which case it seems appropriate to say that the\ncorresponding hope can be rationally endorsed\u2014or false (Frede\n1985: 174f.). The Philebus also presents hope as essential to\nhuman agency: Plato seems to suggest that all our agential\nrepresentations are concerned with the future, which connects them to\nhope (Vogt 2017). Plato\u2019s positive view of hope can also be\nfound in the Apology and the Phaedo, where he argues\nthat hope for the afterlife is rational (Gravlee 2020).\n\nAristotle\u2019s treatment of hope in the context of his discussion\nof the virtue of courage has received some attention (Gravlee 2000;\nLear 2006), as well as the role of hope in his practical philosophy in\ngeneral (Kontos 2021a). On the one hand, Aristotle describes the\nrelationship between hope and courage as a contrast. He identifies two\nsources of hopefulness that are non-courageous: First, it is possible\nto be hopeful \u201cat sea [\u2026] and in disease\u201d, but this hope\ndoes not involve courage, insofar as, in such situations, there is\nneither \u201copportunity of showing prowess\u201d, nor is death\n\u201cnoble\u201d in these cases, according to Aristotle\n(Nicomachean Ethics 3.6, 1115a35ff.). Second, one can be\nhopeful based on one\u2019s experience of good fortune\n(Nicomachean Ethics 3.8, 1117a10ff.). In this case, the\nbelief in the probability of a good outcome is not well grounded, but\nfounded on mere induction. Both kinds of hopefulness are\nnon-courageous. On the other hand, there is also a connection between\nhope and courage via the concept of confidence (Gravlee 2000). For\nexample, Aristotle says:\n\n\nThe coward, then, is a despairing sort of person; for he fears\neverything. The brave man, on the other hand, has the opposite\ndisposition; for confidence is the mark of a hopeful disposition.\n(Nicomachean Ethics 3.7, 1116a2)\n\n\nThus, even though not every hopeful person is courageous, every\ncourageous person is hopeful. Hopefulness creates confidence, which,\nif derived from the right sources, can lead to the virtue of courage.\nGravlee (2000: 471ff.) identifies two further considerations that are\nrelevant for hope\u2019s value in Aristotle\u2019s thought. First,\nhope underlies deliberation, which is needed for any exercise of a\nvirtuous disposition. Second, hopefulness is also presented as\nvaluable in its connection with youth and the virtue of\nmegalopsychia (high-mindedness): Hopefulness spurs us to the\npursuit of the noble. Kontos (2021a, 2021b) focuses both on the\nphenomenology of hope in Aristotle\u2019s thought, and the normative\nquestion of what the conditions are for \u201choping-well\u201d: He\nargues that hoping-well constitutes a correct engagement with moral\nluck, and it requires drawing on past experiences in a proper way as\nwell as reliably perceiving the present reality.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, hope received a less favorable treatment by\nthe Stoic philosophers. In particular, Seneca emphasizes hope\u2019s\nrelation to fear (an idea that is later taken up by Spinoza, see\n section 2.3):\n\n\n[t]hey are bound up with one another, unconnected as they may seem.\nWidely different though they are, the two of them march in unison like\na prisoner and the escort he is handcuffed to. Fear keeps pace with\nhope. Nor does their so moving together surprise me; both belong to a\nmind in suspense, to a mind in a state of anxiety through looking into\nthe future. Both are mainly due to projecting our thoughts far ahead\nof us instead of adapting ourselves to the present. (Seneca, Letter\n5.7\u20138; in: 1969: 38)\n\n\nAccording to Seneca, we should avoid both fear and hope and instead\nfocus on the present and cultivate tranquility of the soul.\n2.2 Christian Authors on Hope\n\nPre-Christian accounts see hope mostly as an attitude to reality that\nis based on insufficient insight into what is true or good. By\ncontrast, Christian philosophers such as Augustine and Thomas Aquinas\nanalyze hope as one of the most central virtues of a believer: Hope,\nprecisely in virtue of its capacity to justify action in a way which\nis not bound to knowledge, is a part of rational faith.\n\nEven in Saint Paul\u2019s argument for the extension of the Christian\ncommunity beyond the Jewish law, hope plays a central role. Paul\nstates that we can only hope for what is uncertain (Romans 8:24; see\nalso Augustine, City of God, book XIX, \u00a7IV, 1960: 139).\nNevertheless, such hope can be the product of the experience of\nsuffering, if this experience is seen through the lens of faith\n(Romans 5:3\u20135) and if the desire to be saved from this suffering\nis supported by confidence in not being disappointed. Instead of\nbackward-looking law-conformity (associated by Paul with the Jewish\nfaith), it is such forward-looking hope that characterizes the\nappropriate relation to God. As an illustration, Paul describes\nAbraham as \u201choping against hope\u201d (Romans 4:18),\nemphasizing the way in which hope goes beyond the evidence.\n\nAugustine of Hippo discusses hope systematically in his\nEnchiridion on Faith, Hope and Love (c. 420). Hope is\ndistinguished from faith\u2014which is also based on incomplete\nevidence\u2014by two features: First, hope is necessarily directed to\nfuture events, whereas faith can also relate to past events (such as\nChrist\u2019s resurrection). Second, hope only relates to what is\ngood for the hopeful person, whereas faith can also relate to what is\nbad (such as punishment for one\u2019s sins). Finally, hope, faith\nand love are seen as interconnected. Only if one loves the future\nfulfillment of God\u2019s will and thus hopes for it can one arrive\nat the correct form of faith (Enchiridion, II.7). As love\nprovides the normative outlook that underlies hope and faith (and\nthus, in some sense, the desire-component of hope), love is seen as a\nmore central virtue than hope (Enchiridion, XXX.114).\n\nThe hope for a life after death also plays an important role in\nAugustine\u2019s political philosophy. In the City of God,\nAugustine distinguishes the actual earthly city from the heavenly city\nthat only exists in the hope placed in God (City of God, book\nXV, \u00a7XXI, 1966: 541). The latter provides a reference point for a\nChristian view of politics. Hope, however, not only provides for a\nperspective on politics which surpasses the narrow perspective of\nclassical politics (Dodaro 2007), but an appropriate theorizing of\nhope also modifies the understanding of traditional political virtues,\nas it redirects their purpose from the earthly to the heavenly\ncity. One example of such a modification concerns punishment: Through\nhope, a Christian \u2018statesman\u2019 will redirect punishment\naway from an exclusive concern with proportionality towards the\npotential reform of the criminal (City of God, book V,\n\u00a7XXIV, 1963: 263).\n\nIn one of his letters to Macedonius, a public official, Augustine\nfinally emphasizes that the hope for a future life underlies all true\nhuman happiness, both on the level of the individual and of the state\n(Letter 155, Political Writings, \u00a74\u20138, pp.\n91\u201394). Thus, hope is not just of concern for individual\nbelievers but also for political leaders that are concerned with collective\nhappiness, as paying attention to hope allows them to pursue a\npolitical constitution that allows true virtue of citizens to emerge\n(see also Dodaro 2007).\n\nWhile Augustine is more or less exclusively concerned with the\nsignificance of hope for our pursuit of a good Christian life, Thomas\nAquinas\u2019 Summa Theologiae contains a systematic\ndiscussion of (ordinary) hope as a passion (ST I-II, q. 40) and as a\ntheological virtue (ST II-II, qq. 17\u201322). The former is directed to\nfinite, earthly goods, whereas hope as a theological virtue is\ndirected to ultimate happiness in the union with God. Even though the\ntwo kinds of hope are clearly distinct, Aquinas provides a unified\naccount of the formal features of their objects (I-II, q. 40, art.1)\n(see Bobier 2020a). The object of hope, he argues, is always thought\nto be good and future. Further, in contrast to mere desire, the\nobjects of hope must be difficult to obtain but nevertheless in the\nrealm of possibility (ST I-II 40.1). This rules out hope for that\nwhich is trivial to procure.\n\nRegarding the rationality of hope, Aquinas has a nuanced view. On the\none hand, he admits that a lack of experience can make one unaware of\nobstacles. This tendency (and drunkenness, ST I-II 40.6) can promote\n(irrational) hope. On the other hand, he assumes that hope can promote\nrational agency: As hope incorporates both knowledge of the possible\nand knowledge of the difficulties to reach the desired outcome, it can\nmotivate agents to devote energy to their activities.\n\nBecause of this ambivalence, hope in the ordinary sense is not a\nvirtue for Aquinas. As a passion, humans can display an excess and a\ndeficiency of hope (ST II-II 17.5); furthermore, passions are not\nvirtues by definition (Bobier 2018). This changes, however, as soon as\nwe examine theological hope, i.e., the hope we can put in God. First,\nas primarily directed towards God, such hope does not know any excess.\nSecond, we cannot understand theological hope as a passion. We must\nanalyze it as a habit of the will. While hope as a passion can only be\nincited by sensible goods (and subsequently motivates action insofar\nas the subject takes herself to be capable of realizing that good), we\ncan also hope for God\u2019s assistance (ST II-II 17.1) in reaching\neternal happiness (ST II-II 17.2). As eternal life and happiness are\nnot sensible goods, this kind of hope cannot be a passion but must\nreside in the will (ST II-II 18.1). Note, however, that Aquinas\ndescribes the theological virtues as habits of the will of a special\nsort: They cannot be acquired by habituation, but can only be given by\nGod\u2019s grace (ST II-II 17.1, see Pinsent 2020 for an\ninterpretation of hope as an \u201cinfused\u201d virtue).\n\nBecause of these two features, hope is a theological virtue (ST II-II\n17.5; see also 1 Corinthians 13). While love (or charity) is directed\nto God for the sake of unity, faith and hope are directed towards God\nwith a view to some good to be obtained from that unity: Faith relates\nto God as a source of knowledge, hope relates to God as a source of\ngoodness (ST II-II 17.6).\n\nThe rationality of theological hope can only be properly understood,\naccording to Aquinas, when we acknowledge that hope has to be preceded\nby faith (which underlies the belief in the possibility of salvation),\nbut, given faith, hope for the good of salvation is rational. In\ncontrast to most modern discussions of hope, Aquinas and other\nChristian authors therefore see hope as compatible with confidence or\neven certainty about the hoped-for outcome while still excluding\nknowledge (Jeffrey 2020: 44). Despair, as caused either by the absence\nof faith or the desire to be saved, is sinful (ST II-II 20.1). As hope\nis, by definition, future-directed, it is only possible for human\nbeings who are uncertain of whether they are blessed or damned,\nwhereas love can persist even after their ultimate fate has been\nrevealed (ST II-II 18.2\u20133).\n2.3 Hope in 17th and 18th Century Philosophy\n\nIn 17th and 18th century philosophy, many\nphilosophers reject Aquinas\u2019 division between different kinds of\npassions in favor of a moral psychology which classifies emotions and\ndesires together as passions that generate action, of which hope is\nusually conceived as a species. Almost all authors mentioned in the\nfollowing also embrace some version of the idea defining for the\n\u201cstandard account\u201d that hope is based on uncertainty in\nbelief together with a representation of an object as desirable\n(Bl\u00f6ser 2020a).\n\nAccording to Descartes, hope is a weaker form of confidence\n(Passions of the Soul, [1649] 1985: 389) and consists in a\ndesire (a representation of an outcome to be both good for us and\npossible) together with a disposition to think of it as likely but not\ncertain (Passions of the Soul, [1649] 1985: 350f, 389). This\nmeans that hope and anxiety always accompany each other (in contrast\nto both despair and confidence which are absolute opposites). Hobbes\nadopts a similar analysis. For him, hope is a complex passion or a\n\u201cpleasure of the mind\u201d, i.e., a pleasure that arises not\nfrom direct sensation but from thinking. For Hobbes, the simplest\nbuilding block underlying hope is appetite, and \u201cappetite with\nan opinion of obtaining\u201d is hope (Leviathan, 36,\nI.VI.14). As in Descartes, hope serves as a building block for more\ncomplex mental phenomena, such as courage or confidence\n(Leviathan, 36f, I.VI.17/19). But hope also plays a role in\nthe mental activity of deliberation which is defined as the\nalternation of hope and fear with appetites and aversion\n(Leviathan, 39, I.VI.49; see also Bobier 2020b). Hope\u2014a\nterm which Hobbes often uses more or less synonymously with\n(justified) expectation\u2014plays an important role in the political\napplication of his moral psychology: Not only is the equality in the\nstate of nature defined as an equality of hope (Leviathan,\n83, I.XIII.3)\u2014which makes it rational for everyone to pursue\ntheir individual advantage\u2014the laws of nature also command one\nto seek peace where one has hope for obtaining it (Leviathan,\n87, I.XIV.4). Both the collective agency problem in the state of\nnature and the solution to it thus depend on what hopes individuals\ncan rationally entertain.\n\nSpinoza also defines the passion of hope as a form of pleasure\n(Ethics III, P18, Spinoza [1677] 1985: 505) or joy that is\nmingled with sadness (due to the uncertainty of the outcome, see\nShort Treatise, book II, ch. IX, Spinoza [c. 1660] 1985:\n113). In contrast to more modern definitions, Spinoza distinguishes\nthe pleasure that is involved in hope from desire. Hope (in the\nEthics) is thus not necessarily connected to desire, but\nrather a way in which the mind is affected by the idea of a future\nevent. In contrast to Hobbes and Descartes, Spinoza understands hope\nas fundamentally irrational. He argues that it must be the result of\nfalse belief inasmuch as it does not correctly represent that\neverything is governed by necessity (Short Treatise, book II,\nch. IX, [c. 1660] 1985: 113). Additionally, in the Ethics,\nSpinoza describes hope as one of the causes of superstition,\nespecially as it is always accompanied by fear (Ethics III,\nP50, [1677] 1985: 521). Such fear necessarily precludes it from being\nintrinsically good (Ethics IV, P47, [1677] 1985: 573). This\nis also the reason why we should attempt to make ourselves independent\nfrom hope (although Gatens et al. (2021: 202) argue that Spinoza also\nhas room for the idea of reasonable hopes).\n\nSpinoza agrees with Hobbes, however, by ascribing political\nsignificance to hope. As he explains in the Theological-Political\nTreatise, the fact that people are governed by hope and fear makes\nthem easy victims of superstition and false belief\n(Theological-Political Treatise, [1670] 2002: 389); however,\ngood laws can also take advantage of this and motivate people by\narranging outcomes such that they can be motivated by hope\n(Theological-Political Treatise, [1670] 2002: 439; see Gatens\net al. 2021 for a discussion of the political significance of hope in\nSpinoza). The same importance he places on hope also underlies his\nsocial contract argument. Like Hobbes, he argues that the only reason\nwhy people remain faithful to the social contract or carry out the orders\nof a sovereign has to be found in their hope of obtaining a certain\ngood this way (Theological-Political Treatise, [1670] 2002:\n529). Even a people as a whole is always united by common hopes and\nfears (Political Treatise, [1675] 2002: 700), but hope rather\nthan fear is dominant in the case of free peoples (ibid.).\nThis leads Spinoza to proclaim hope and fear as the basis of political\npower in the Political Treatise ([1675] 2002: 686).\n\nHume\u2019s account is another example of an analysis of hope as a\npassion\u2014modified, however, by the specific approach he takes to\nhuman psychology. For Hume, hope is a \u201cdirect passion\u201d\nthat is produced when the mind considers events that have a\nprobability between absolute certainty and absolute impossibility.\nHume describes probability-beliefs as an effect of the mind\nentertaining contrary views\u2014of an event or object as either\nexistent or non-existent\u2014in quick succession after another. Each\nof these views gives rise to either joy or sorrow (when the object is\nsomething good or bad) which linger longer in the mind than the\noriginal imagination of the object\u2019s existence or non-existence.\nWhen considering objects that are probable, but not certain, the mind\nis thus affected by a mixture of joy and sorrow that, depending on the\npredominant element, can be called hope or fear.\n\n\nIt is after this manner that hope and fear arise from the different\nmixture of these opposite passions of grief and joy, and from their\nimperfect union and conjunction. (Treatise, [1738] 2007:\n283)\n\n\nAs Hume sees hope as a necessary effect of the consideration of an\nuncertain event, it follows that we cannot but hope for any positive\noutcome about which we are uncertain. The uncertainty in question can\nbe based on the actual uncertainty of the event but also on uncertain\nbelief.\n2.4 Immanuel Kant\n\nWhile hope is primarily discussed as a feature of the psychology of\nindividual humans in the 17th and 18th century\nand, as a non-cognitive attitude, taken to be neither essentially\nrational nor irrational, it is given much greater significance by\nImmanuel Kant who adopts a much more substantial (and complex) view of\nthe connection between hope and reason.\n\nKant\u2019s definition of hope as an \u201cunexpected offering of\nthe prospect of immeasurable good fortune\u201d (AE 7:255) in the\nAnthropology seems to remain within the traditional discourse\nabout hope. However, Kant eventually accords hope a central place in\nhis philosophical system by focusing on hope as an attitude that\nallows human reason to relate to those questions which cannot be\nanswered by experience. In the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant\nstates the question \u201cFor what may I hope?\u201d as one of the\nfundamental questions of philosophy, after \u201cWhat can I\nknow?\u201d and \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d (A805/B833). This\nquestion, as far as its answer depends on claims regarding the\nconsequences of moral righteousness and the existence of God, is\n\u201csimultaneously practical and theoretical\u201d (A805/B833) and\nit is answered by religion (AE 9:25). Kant\u2019s account of hope\nconsequently connects his moral philosophy with his views on religion.\nHe emphasizes the rational potential of such hope, but he also makes\nclear that rational hope is intimately connected to religious faith,\ni.e., the belief in God.\n\nKant considers three primary objects of hope in his writings: (1)\nOne\u2019s own happiness (as part of the highest good), (2)\none\u2019s own moral progress (in the Religion) and (3) the\nmoral improvement of the human race as a whole (in his\nhistorical-political writings).\n\n(1) In the Canon of the Critique of Pure Reason,\nKant states clearly: \u201call hope concerns happiness\u201d\n(A805/B833). However, it is not the hope for one\u2019s own happiness\nsimpliciter that is at stake, but the hope for happiness that\none deserves because of one\u2019s moral conduct (A809/B837). Kant\nargues that there is a necessary connection between the moral\nlaw and the hope for happiness. However, this connection exists only\n\u201cin the idea of pure reason\u201d, not in nature (A809/B837). A\nproportionality between happiness and morality can only be thought of\nas necessary in an intelligible, moral world, where we abstract from\nall hindrances to moral conduct. In the empirical world of experience,\nthere is no guarantee for a necessary connection between moral conduct\nand happiness. Thus, Kant concludes, we may reasonably hope for\nhappiness in proportion to morality only if we introduce the\nadditional non-empirical assumption of \u201ca highest reason, which\ncommands in accordance with moral laws, as [\u2026] the cause of\nnature\u201d (A810/B838). This way, Kant connects morality and\nhappiness in the object of hope and secures its possibility in a\nhighest reason, i.e., in God. Kant calls the connection between\n\u201chappiness in exact proportion with the morality of rational\nbeings, through which they are worthy of it\u201d the highest\ngood (A814/B842). A peculiarity of Kant\u2019s treatment of hope\nin the Canon is that hope for the highest good is apparently\nconsidered necessary for moral motivation (A813/B841)\u2014a thesis\nhe rejects in his later writings.\n\nKant\u2019s account of hope for happiness presents hope as very\nclosely connected to Kant\u2019s concept of faith. This becomes\nobvious in the Critique of Practical Reason. Kant argues that\nin order to believe in the possibility of the highest good\u2014and\nwe have to believe in this possibility, as it is prescribed by the\ncategorical imperative\u2014we have to believe in or\npostulate the existence of God and the immortality of the\nsoul. Kant himself uses both the concept of belief or faith\nand the concept of hope in explaining the content of the\npostulate of immortality: we must presuppose immortality in\norder to conceive of the highest good as \u201cpractically\npossible\u201d and we may therefore \u201chope for a further\nuninterrupted continuance of this [moral] progress, however long his\nexistence may last, even beyond this life\u201d (AE 5:123). Thus,\nKant can be understood as arguing in favor of a traditional religious\nform of hope\u2014hope for a life after death or immortality of the\nsoul. However, he points out that immortality is not a \u2018mere\u2019\nhope (i.e., a hope for an outcome where we lack evidence for the claim\nthat it is really possible), but that reason makes it necessary (as a\nconsequence of the categorical imperative) to assume that immortality\nis possible.\n\nWhereas some Kant interpreters do not clearly distinguish between hope\nand faith (Rossi 1982, Flikschuh 2010), Andrew Chignell emphasizes\nthat hope is an attitude that is distinct from faith or belief and\nthat Kant follows an \u201cassert-the-stronger\u201d policy: He\nasserts the strongest justified attitude towards p (justified\nbelief), even if one holds also weaker attitudes towards p\n(hope) (Chignell 2013: 198). O\u2019Neill interprets Kant as holding\nthat hope provides a reason for religious belief: Belief in\nGod and immortality is not \u201cmerely possible\u201d, but a matter\nof \u201ctaking a hopeful view of human destiny\u201d (O\u2019Neill\n1996: 281). According to O\u2019Neill, the reason for faith is the\nhope that moral action is successful, i.e., that our moral intention\ncan make a difference to the natural order.\n\n(2) In the Religion, Kant envisages one\u2019s own moral\nimprovement as an object of hope, which requires that one change\none\u2019s fundamental maxim from a bad one to a good one. The\nproblem is that on the one hand, we have a duty to improve morally and\nhence must be capable of doing so (AE 6:45), but on the other hand, it\nis unclear how this can be possible if one\u2019s fundamental maxim\nis corrupt. Since we cannot know how this is possible, moral\nimprovement remains an object of hope. Kant suggests two alternative\nhopes: the hope to, through one\u2019s \u201cown efforts\u201d,\nbecome a better person (AE 6:46) and the hope that what exceeds\none\u2019s power will be taken care of by God (AE 6:52).\n\n(3) In his political and historical writings, Kant considers another\nobject of reasonable hope: the hope for historical progress towards a\nmorally better, peaceful future. We find a similar relationship\nbetween rational belief and hope as with regard to God and\nimmortality: Kant sees the moral improvement of the human race as a\nhope that is based on a transcendental assumption (in the mode of\nfaith) in a teleological order of nature. Kant assigns \u201chope for\nbetter times\u201d an important function for moral motivation by\nclaiming that without it, the desire to benefit the common good would\n\u201cnever have warmed the human heart\u201d (AE 8:309). Kant\nrecommends a view of human history with a \u201cconfirmation\nbias\u201d (Kleingeld 2012: 175), i.e., with a view to the\nrealization of moral demands.\n\nAside from these systematic issues regarding hope in Kant\u2019s\nphilosophy, it is worth summarizing some general features that Kant\ntouches upon concerning hope. Regarding a descriptive account\nof what it means that a person hopes that p, one can extract\ntwo necessary conditions from Kant\u2019s remarks that are in line\nwith the standard account of hope: The object of hope must be\nuncertain, and the person must wish for it. Both conditions can be\nfound in the following passage from Perpetual Peace:\n\n\n[R]eason is not enlightened enough to survey the entire series of\npredetermining causes that foretell with certainty the happy or\nunhappy consequences of humankind\u2019s activities in accordance\nwith the mechanism of nature (although it does let us hope that these\nwill be in accord with our wishes). (AE 8:370)\n\n\nIn regard to the normative conditions under which hope is\nrational, Kant is sensitive to a theoretical and practical dimension:\nHe focuses on hopes that are (necessarily) connected with a moral duty\nand thus involve a practical necessity. From a theoretical\npoint of view, Kant\u2019s main concern is to show that these hopes\nare not impossible. While he holds that empirical evidence permits\nhoping as long as there is no proof to the contrary (AE 8:309f.), this\nminimal criterion is connected to the idea that hope is based on\ntranscendental assumptions (i.e., the existence of God, immortality,\nand a teleology of nature) (Bl\u00f6ser 2020b).\n\nKant\u2019s account of hope has recently attracted considerable\ninterest, both regarding matters of Kant scholarship and the\napplication and development of a Kantian notion of hope in various\ncontexts. As to Kant scholarship, D\u00fcring and D\u00fcwell (2017) follow\nBeyleveld and Ziche (2015) in emphasizing the relevance of the\nCritique of Judgment for an understanding of Kantian hope\n\u2013\u2013 they view hope as aesthetically structured.\nZuckert (2018) argues that Kantian hope is a feeling.\nDanziger (2020) makes the case that hope plays a role even in\nKant\u2019s theoretical philosophy.\n\nAs to the application and development of Kant\u2019s account of hope,\nChignell (2018) reconstructs Kant\u2019s moral argument for faith in\nthe existence of God (where hope plays a crucial role) and explores\nits relevance for political contexts (the food system), where the\nchances that an individual will make a difference are very low.\nSimilarly, Huber (2019) argues that Kantian hope can be seen as\nplaying an important role in preventing demoralization and sustaining\nthe commitment to political action when the prospects of success are\ndim. Dineen (2020) delineates a Kantian conception of hope that might\ninform practical education, because it warrants us in thinking that we\nare able to set and achieve ends, even in light of imperfection and\nvulnerability. Speight (2021) shows how Walter Benjamin took up and\ntransformed Kant\u2019s account of hope by shifting from a personal\nto a collective perspective on hope and to a concern with the\npast.\n2.5 Post-Kantian Philosophy and Existentialism\n\nIn Post-Kantian philosophy, the role of hope is disputed. One can\nidentify two distinct approaches. On the one hand, there are authors\nlike Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche and Albert Camus who\nreject hope, not so much as epistemically irrational but as an\nexpression of a misguided relationship to the world that is unable to\nface the demands of human existence. On the other hand, authors like\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Gabriel Marcel take hope to be a means to\novercome the limitations of ordinary experience.\n\nKierkegaard examines hope primarily as it is connected to religious\nfaith. However, whereas Kant aims to show that our belief in God and\nhope for the highest good is possible within the limits of reason,\nKierkegaard is keen to emphasize that (eternal) hope must transcend\nall understanding. As an antidote to despair, hope plays a positive\nrole in Kierkegaard\u2019s work, culminating in his advice: \u201ca\nperson\u2019s whole life should be the time of hope!\u201d\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 251). In Works of Love, Kierkegaard\ndefines hope in its most general form as a relation to the possibility\nof the good: \u201cTo relate oneself expectantly to the possibility\nof the good is to hope\u201d (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995:\n249).\n\nMost interpreters of Kierkegaard emphasize a distinction between\n\u201cheavenly\u201d (or eternal) hope and \u201cearthly\u201d (or\ntemporal) hope (Bernier 2015; Fremstedal 2012; McDonald 2014). In some\npassages, Kierkegaard indeed seems to assume that there is also\n\u201cnatural hope\u201d (Kierkegaard [1851] 1990: 82) or hope\n\u201cfor some earthly advantage\u201d (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995:\n261). However, strictly speaking, Kierkegaard considers this the\n\u201cwrong language usage\u201d (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 261). He\ncompletes his definition as follows: \u201cTo relate oneself\nexpectantly to the possibility of the good is to hope, which\ncannot be any temporal expectancy but is an eternal hope\u201d\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 249). On Kierkegaard\u2019s view,\nhope\u2014strictly speaking\u2014is thus always directed towards the\neternal, \u201csince hope pertains to the possibility of the good,\nand thereby to the eternal\u201d (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 249). This\nis connected to Kierkegaard\u2019s account of time. Hope, as a form\nof expectation, is an attitude towards the possible. While\nexpectation, generally speaking, relates to the possibility of both\ngood and evil (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 249), hope relates only to the\npossibility of good. The possibility of the good, on\nKierkegaard\u2019s account, is a feature of the eternal (\u201cin\ntime, the eternal is the possible, the future\u201d).\n\nWhile the expectation of earthly goods is often\ndisappointed\u2014either because it is fulfilled too late or not at\nall (Kierkegaard [1843\u20131844] 1990: 215)\u2014eternal hope\ncannot in principle be disappointed (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995:\n261\u20133, Kierkegaard [1843\u20131844] 1990: 216). Eternal hope\nmeans \u201cat every moment always to hope all things\u201d\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 249). Kierkegaard mostly equates eternal\nhope with Christian hope (McDonald 2014: 164).\n\nIn order to understand the relation between earthly and heavenly hope,\nit is helpful to consider the dialectical progression of hope that\nKierkegaard presents in the Nachla\u00df (Malantschuk (ed.) 1978:\n247). There is a kind of hope that occurs spontaneously in youth,\nwhich appears to be a pre-reflexive hope, a kind of immediate trust or\nconfidence (Fremstedal 2012: 52). It is followed by the\n\u201csupportive calculation of the understanding\u201d, i.e., by\nhope involving the reflection about the probability of the hoped-for\noutcome. This (earthly) hope is often disappointed by the lateness or\nnon-arrival of the expected goods. This disappointment is necessary in\norder to acquire eternal hope, which \u201cis against hope, because\naccording to that purely natural hope there was no more hope;\nconsequently this hope is against hope\u201d (Kierkegaard [1851]\n1990: 82). Kierkegaard\u2019s interpretation of Abraham\u2019s story\nin Fear and Trembling can be understood as an illustration of\nthis kind of hope (Lippitt 2015).\n\nWhereas earthly hope is judged by the understanding according to its\nprobability, eternal hope exceeds the limits of understanding. It is\ntherefore commonly judged as irrational or as \u201clunacy\u201d\n(Kierkegaard [1851] 1990: 83). Kierkegaard does not explicitly take up\nthe question of when hope is rational\u2014presumably because eternal\nhope exceeds reason\u2014but he frames the question of good or bad\nhope in terms of \u201chonor\u201d and \u201cshame\u201d\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 260f.). He observes that a person who\nentertained an earthly hope that has not been fulfilled is very often\ncriticized as imprudent (or \u201cput to shame\u201d (Kierkegaard\n[1847] 1995: 260)) because this is supposed to show that she\n\u201cmiscalculated\u201d (ibid.). Kierkegaard objects to this\nperspective of \u201csagacity\u201d that judges hope only with\nregard to its fulfillment. Rather, we should pay attention to the\nvalue of the hoped-for ends (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 261). Eternal\nhope, on this account, \u201cis never put to shame\u201d\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 260, see also 263). Further, and in line\nwith the Christian tradition, he argues that the value of hope depends\non its relation to love: We hope for ourselves if and only if we hope\nfor others, and only to the same degree. Love\n\n\nis the middle term: without love, no hope for oneself; with love, hope\nfor all others\u2014and to the same degree one hopes for oneself, to\nthe same degree one hopes for others, since to the same degree one is\nloving. (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 260)\n\n\nThus, similarly to Kant\u2019s account, one\u2019s hope stands in a\nproportional relationship to an ethical demand. However, Kierkegaard\ndoes not see hope limited by our meeting an ethical\ndemand.\n\n\nRather, Kierkegaard sees the proportional relation as determining\nwhether we are in fact hoping, and the actual degree of our\nexpectancy. Our hope for ourselves is only realizable in and through\nour hope for another. (Bernier 2015: 315)\n\n\nAs already mentioned, Schopenhauer represents the opposite approach in\npost-Kantian philosophy. Even though he holds that it is natural for\nhumans to hope (Parerga and Paralipomena II, 1851: \u00a7313), he\nalso claims that we generally ought to hope less than we are inclined\nto, calling hope a \u201cfolly of the heart\u201d (ibid.).\nAmbivalent remarks concerning the value of hope (he interprets\nPandora\u2019s box as containing all the goods, Parerga and\nParalipomena II, 1851: \u00a7200) can be found throughout his\nwritings, but on the whole, criticism prevails. There are two aspects\nto his critical evaluation of hope: hope\u2019s influence on the\nintellect and its role for happiness. In Schopenhauer\u2019s\ndichotomy of the will and the intellect, hope is an expression of the\nwill or, more precisely, an inclination. One reason why hope is\nproblematic with respect to its influence on the intellect is that it\npresents what we wish for as probable (The World as Will and\nRepresentation, vol. 2, [1818] 1958: 216, 218). Schopenhauer\nconcedes that hope sharpens our perception insofar as it makes certain\nfeatures of the world salient. But he links this thesis to the\nstronger claim that hope may make it (often) impossible to\ngrasp things that are relevant. Hope thus distorts cognition in a\nproblematic way because it hinders the intellect in grasping the\ntruth. However, Schopenhauer also concedes the possibility of a\npositive effect of hope, namely as motivation and support of the\nintellect (The World as Will and Representation, vol. 2,\n[1818] 1958: 221).\n\nWith regard to its contribution to personal happiness, Schopenhauer\nmentions a positive role of hope in his comparison of the life of\nanimals with that of humans. He states that animals experience less\npleasure than humans, because they lack hope and therefore the\npleasures of anticipation. But hope can not only lead to\ndisappointment when the hoped-for object is not realized, it can even\nbe disappointing when it is fulfilled if the outcome does not provide\nas much satisfaction as was expected (The World as Will and\nRepresentation, vol. 2 [1818] 1958: 573). Schopenhauer also\ncriticizes Kant\u2019s idea that we may hope for our own happiness in\nproportion to our moral conduct (the highest good). This conception of\nhope, according to Schopenhauer, leads Kant to remain implicitly\ncommitted to a form of eudaimonism (Basis of Morality II,\n\u00a73, 34).\n\nThus, even though Schopenhauer occasionally hints at positive aspects\nof hope, his overall evaluation of hope is negative. This is\nconsistent with his view that life is filled with unavoidable\nfrustration and suffering, and that suffering can be reduced only by\ngetting rid of one\u2019s desires. Ideally, this amounts to the\n\u201cnegation of the will to life\u201d (The World as Will and\nRepresentation, vol. 1, [1818] 2010: 405). The \u201ctemptations\nof hope\u201d (The World as Will and Representation, vol. 1,\n[1818] 2010: 419) function as obstacles to the negation of the will,\nwhereas hopelessness can help to transform one\u2019s mind and\nacquire \u201cgenuine goodness and purity of mind\u201d (The\nWorld as Will and Representation, vol. 1, [1818] 2010: 420).\nInterestingly, Schopenhauer does have sympathies with the idea of\nsalvation, which lies in the denial of the will (Schopenhauer [1818]\n1958: 610), that is, he seems to subscribe to a kind of transcendent\nhope for an end of all suffering (Schulz 2002: 125). Even though he\ndoes not say so, one could characterize his view as a \u201chope for\nthe end of hope\u201d.\n\nNietzsche is perhaps the most famous critic of hope in the\npost-Kantian tradition. In the third preface to Zarathustra,\nhe warns: \u201cdo not believe those who speak to you of\nextraterrestrial hopes!\u201d (Zarathustra, [1883\u201385]\n2006: 6) Similarly, in Beyond Good and Evil (1886) he opposes\nall notions of hope \u201cin hidden harmonies, in future blessedness\nand justice\u201d (Beyond Good and Evil, [1886] 2008: 562).\nIn his interpretation of Pandora\u2019s myth (Human, All Too\nHuman, 1878: \u00a771), he calls hope \u201cthe worst of all evils\nbecause it prolongs the torments of man\u201d. However, a closer look\nreveals that, outside his criticism of religious and metaphysical\nhopes, he also hints at a positive perspective on hope:\n\u201cthat mankind be redeemed from revenge: that to me is\nthe bridge to the highest hope and a rainbow after long\nthunderstorms\u201d (Zarathustra, [1883\u201385] 2006: 77).\nNietzsche counts hope among the \u201cstrong emotions\u201d\n(Nietzsche [1887] 2006: 103), next to anger, fear, voluptuousness, and\nrevenge. Furthermore, he repeatedly characterizes hope using the\nmetaphor of a rainbow: \u201chope is the rainbow over the cascading\nstream of life\u201d [\u201cDie Hoffnung ist der Regenbogen \u00fcber\nden herabst\u00fcrzenden j\u00e4hen Bach des Lebens\u201d] (as cited in\nBidmon 2016: 188). However, the metaphor of the \u201crainbow\u201d\nis ambivalent. On the one hand, it is connected to Nietzsches vision\nof the \u201coverman\u201d: \u201cDo you not see it, the rainbow\nand the bridges of the overman?\u201d (Zarathustra,\n[1883\u201385] 2006: 36). On the other hand, however, the rainbow is\nelusive and withdraws itself\u2014Nietzsche calls it an\n\u201cillusory bridge\u201d (Zarathustra, [1883\u201385]\n2006: 175; see also Bidmon 2016: 188f.). In Beyond Good and\nEvil, he finally claims that we should \u201cfix our\nhopes\u201d in \u201cnew philosophers\u201d, \u201cin minds strong\nand original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value\u201d\n(Beyond Good and Evil, [1886] 2008: 600). In Human, All\nToo Human, he similarly envisages change of the social order as\nan object of hope:\n\n\n[W]e are only reasonably entitled to hope when we believe that we and\nour equals have more strength in heart and head than the\nrepresentatives of the existing state of things. (Human, All Too\nHuman, 1878: \u00a7443)\n\n\nReasonable hope is thus grounded in a trust in one\u2019s capacity to\nbring about the desired outcome. However, Nietzsche adds that usually\nthis hope amounts to \u201cpresumption, an\nover-estimation\u201d (ibid.).\n\nCamus follows Nietzsche in declaring (religious) hope the worst of all\nevils (Judaken and Bernasconi 2012: 264). His critique of hope is\nlinked to the idea that the human existence is absurd.\nThe \u201celusive feeling of absurdity\u201d (Camus 1955: 12) is\ncharacterized by a discrepancy: The human mind asks fundamental\nquestions about the meaning of life, but the world does\nnot provide answers. Camus\u2019 understanding of the absurd is best\ncaptured in the image of Sisyphus, who exemplifies life\u2019s\nabsurdity in his \u201cfutile and hopeless labor\u201d (Camus 1955:\n119). The assumption that life is absurd goes hand in hand with the\ndenial of religious hope for salvation. In his early writing\nNuptials ([1938] 1970), Camus opposes religious ideas about\nthe immortal soul and hope for an afterlife. In fact,\n\u201c[h]ope is the error Camus wishes to\navoid\u201d (Aronson 2012). Even though Camus is often regarded as an\nexistentialist, he distances himself from this movement.\nOne reason is precisely his disagreement with the account of hope of\nthe existentialists, Kierkegaard in particular, of which he says that\n\u201cthey deify what crushes them and find reason to hope in what\nimpoverishes them. That forced hope is religious in all of them\u201d\n(Camus 1955: 32).\n\nAs already mentioned, one kind of hope that Camus flatly rejects is\nreligious hope for a life beyond death. A second kind of hope,\nprimarily discussed in The Rebel, is the hope founded on a\ngreat cause beyond oneself, i.e., \u201chope of another life one must\n\u2018deserve\u2019\u201d (Camus 1955: 8). The problem with hoping for\nsocial utopias, according to Camus, is that they tend to be\ndictatorial. A further reason to reject such hopes seems to be that\nthey distract from the life of the senses, from the here-and-now and\nfrom appreciating the beauty of this life. We also do not need hope to\ncope with the hardships of life and death: Instead of hoping for a\nlife after death (or committing suicide), one should be conscious of\ndeath as \u201cthe most obvious absurdity\u201d (Camus 1955: 59) and\n\u201cdie unreconciled and not of one\u2019s own free will\u201d\n(Camus 1955: 55). Sisyphus exemplifies the attitude of lucidity and\nconsciousness that Camus recommends. Even though he does not hope for\na better future,\u2014or rather because he does not hope for\na better future\u2014\u201c[o]ne must imagine Sisyphus happy\u201d\n(Camus 1955: 123).\n\nDespite his criticism of hope, Camus states that it is (nearly)\nimpossible to live without hope, even if one wishes to be free of hope\n(Camus 1955: 113). Presumably this claim is only descriptive, stating\na fact about human psychology. However, in a letter to his friend and\npoet Ren\u00e9 Char, Camus called The Rebel a \u201clivre\nd\u2019espoir\u201d [book of hope] (Schlette 1995: 130). On that\nnote, it has recently been suggested that Camus allows for a positive\nview of hope\u2014a kind of \u201c\u00e9trange espoir\u201d [strange\nhope] that is directed towards the possibilities inherent in the\npresent (Schlette 1995: 134) and that is characterized by humanism and\nsolidarity with all human beings (Bidmon 2016: 233).\n\nWhereas the positive role of hope in Camus is at best hidden, it\nsurfaces prominently in the writings of Marcel. At the heart of\nMarcel\u2019s account of hope is the distinction between \u201c\u2018I\nhope\u2026\u2019, the absolute statement, and \u2018I hope\nthat\u2026\u2019\u201d (Marcel [1952] 2010: 26). Marcel is mostly\ninterested in a general, absolute hope, which he conceives as\n\u201cthe act by which [\u2026] temptation to despair is actively or\nvictoriously overcome\u201d (Marcel [1952] 2010: 30f.). One way in\nwhich Marcel characterizes the \u201cmystery\u201d (Marcel [1952]\n2010: 29) of hope is by alluding to the connection between hope and\npatience (Marcel [1952] 2010: 33). Hope implies the respect for\n\u201cpersonal rhythm\u201d (ibid.) and \u201cconfidence in a\ncertain process of growth and development\u201d (Marcel [1952] 2010:\n34). Marcel takes up the question of the rationality of hope in asking\nwhether hope is an illusion that consists in taking one\u2019s wishes\nfor reality (Marcel [1952] 2010: 39). He answers that this objection\nagainst the value of hope applies primarily to hopes that are directed\ntowards a particular outcome (\u201cto hope that X\u201d), but it\ndoes not apply when hope transcends the imagination. Because the\nperson who hopes simpliciter does not anticipate a particular\nevent, her hope cannot be judged with regard to whether it is likely\nto be fulfilled. Marcel illustrates this with the example of an\ninvalid (Marcel [1952] 2010: 40). If this person hopes that he will be\nhealthy at a certain point in time, there is the danger of\ndisappointment and despair if it does not happen. However, absolute\nhope, Marcel explains, implies a \u201cmethod of surmounting\u201d:\nThe patient has absolute hope if he realizes that \u201ceverything is\nnot necessarily lost if there is no cure\u201d (Marcel [1952] 2010:\n40). Being a \u201ctheistic Existentialist\u201d (Treanor and\nSweetman 2016) like Kierkegaard, Marcel ultimately connects this\npossibility of absolute hope to the existence of God. Absolute hope is\nnecessarily connected to faith in God and is a \u201cresponse of the\ncreature to the infinite Being to whom it is conscious of owing\neverything that it has\u201d (Marcel [1952] 2010: 41).\n2.6 Pragmatism\n\nEven though hope rarely features explicitly in pragmatist writings, it\nhas been suggested that pragmatist accounts of hope can be found in\nthe works of William James and John Dewey (Fishman and McCarthy 2007;\nGreen 2008; Koopman 2006, 2009; Rorty 1999; Shade 2001). As Patrick\nShade notes, the issue of hope is \u201cimplicit in most pragmatic\nphilosophies\u201d, as it is related to central pragmatist topics,\nsuch as meliorism and faith, and particular hopes for social progress\n(Shade 2001: 9f.). Sarah Stitzlein (2020) argues that a conception of\nhope as a set of habits unites the understanding of hope in the\nwritings of the classical pragmatists (Charles Peirce, William James,\nJohn Dewey) and is further developed in the social and political\nwritings of recent pragmatists (Richard Rorty, Judith Green, Cornel\nWest, Patrick Shade, Colin Koopman).\n\nIndeed, James\u2019 concept of faith in The Will to Believe\nis closely linked to hope. In his essay, James aims to offer a\n\u201cjustification of faith, a defense of our right to adopt a\nbelieving attitude in religious matters\u201d (James [1897] 2015: 1).\nEven though his primary subject is religious faith, he points out that\na structurally similar justification of faith or trust can be applied\nto social questions. It can be rational to believe that the other is\ntrustworthy or likes us, even though we may not be able to prove it.\nThree criteria have to be fulfilled for faith to be rational: the\nquestion cannot be decided scientifically, the belief may be true, and\nwe are better off (even now) if we believe. In his argument, James\ndraws a link to the concept of hope when claiming that the skeptic or\nagnostic attitude is not more rational than the attitude of faith. The\nskeptic holds \u201cthat to yield to our fear of its being error is\nwiser and better than to yield to our hope that it may be true\u201d\n(James [1897] 2015: 27). James criticizes this attitude: \u201cwhat\nproof is there that dupery through hope is so much worse than dupery\nthrough fear?\u201d (James [1897] 2015: 27).\n\nA pragmatist conception of hope has often been seen as closely linked\nto the idea of meliorism and progress (e.g., in Dewey\u2019s work,\nsee Shade 2001: 139). In his lectures on Pragmatism, James\nsituates the doctrine of meliorism between pessimism and optimism:\n\u201cMeliorism treats salvation as neither necessary nor impossible.\nIt treats it as a possibility\u201d (James 2000: 125). For Dewey, the\nobject of hope or meliorism is first and foremost democracy, which is\n\u201cthe simple idea that political and ethical progress hinges on\nnothing more than persons, their values, and their actions\u201d\n(Dewey [1916] 1980: 107).\n\nDrawing on James\u2019 account of conversion in the Varieties of\nReligious Experience, Sheehey argues that James can be seen as\nadvocating a concept of hope that does not rely on the idea of\nprogress, but relies on a \u201ctemporality of crisis\u201d that\nallows for an understanding of historical change beyond progress or\ndecline (Sheehey 2019).\n3. The Standard Account and the Rationality of Hope\n\nThe contemporary debate about hope in analytic philosophy is primarily\nconcerned with providing a definition of hope, explicating standards\nof rationality and explaining the value of hope. The debate takes as\nits starting point what has been called the \u201corthodox\ndefinition\u201d (Martin 2013: 11) or the \u201cstandard\naccount\u201d (Meirav 2009: 217), which analyzes \u201chope that\np\u201d in terms of a wish or desire for p and a\nbelief concerning p\u2019s possibility. R.S. Downie is\nrepresentative of this position:\n\n\nThere are two criteria which are independently necessary and jointly\nsufficient for \u2018hope that\u2019. The first is that the object of\nhope must be desired by the hoper. [\u2026] The second [\u2026] is that the\nobject of hope falls within a range of physical possibility which\nincludes the improbable but excludes the certain and the merely\nlogically possible. (Downie 1963: 248f.)\n\n\nSimilarly, J. P. Day writes:\n\n\n\u201cA hopes that p\u201d is true iff\n\u201cA wishes that p, and A thinks that\np has some degree of probability, however small\u201d is\ntrue. (Day 1969: 89)\n\n\nThe desire-condition captures the intuition that we only hope for what\nwe take to be good (at least in some respect) or desirable. The belief\ncomponent is meant to capture the intuition that we do not normally\nhope for what we think is impossible (or certain), whereas this is not\na problem for desires or wishes (in e.g., \u201cI wish I could\nfly\u201d).\n\nMost authors implicitly assume that the hoped-for event is in the\nfuture. In ordinary usage however, people often express hopes\nregarding past events of which they do not have complete knowledge. An\nexample is the hope that someone did not suffer excessively when they\ndied. While some authors consider this use of language to be parasitic\non the future-directed case (McGeer 2004: 104), others argue that\nthese are genuine cases of hope (Martin 2013: 68).\n\nAnother question in this context concerns the concept of possibility\nthat is at issue: It seems clear that we cannot hope for the logically\nimpossible, but can we hope for the physically impossible, e.g., that\nthe dead will rise tomorrow? Downie, for example, holds that logical\npossibility is not enough (Downie 1963: 249), whereas Chignell does\nnot exclude the possibility of hope for something which is physically\nimpossible (Chignell 2013: 201ff.). Whatever the answer to this\nquestion, all views (except Wheatley 1958) allow for cases of hope in\nwhich the outcome is extremely improbable; in other words, no lower\nbound to the probability is required for hoping (Meirav 2009:\n219).\n\nObjections have been raised against the idea that the standard\ndefinition provides sufficient conditions for hope. There are two main\nlines of objections: the \u201cdespair objection\u201d and the\n\u201csubstantial hope objection\u201d (Milona 2020a: 103).\nAccording to the \u201cdespair objection\u201d, two people can have\nidentical desires and beliefs about the possibility of an outcome, and\nyet one of them may hope for the outcome while the other despairs of\nit (Meirav 2009). The \u201csubstantial hope objection\u201d holds\nthat even though the standard definition might capture a minimal sense\nof hope, it fails to explain the special value of more\n\u201csubstantial\u201d kinds of hope. In particular, it fails to\nexplain how hope can have special motivating force in difficult\ncircumstances, especially when the probability of the desired outcome\nis low (Pettit 2004; Calhoun 2018). These objections either lead to\nthe claim that the standard definition must be revised or motivate the\nproposal that hope is entirely different from desire and belief, and\nhence irreducible to them.\n\nLuc Bovens suggests that besides desire and belief, hope also involves\nmental imaging (Bovens 1999). However, it has been objected\nthat mental imaging is already entailed by desire (and hence, that the\nstandard definition can account for this) and that it is still not\nable to distinguish hope from despair, since a despairing person can\nstill form mental images about the desired outcome. Andrew Chignell\nsuggests a variant of Bovens\u2019 account, although he does not\nrequire imaging but a specific kind of attention: A subject who hopes\nis disposed to focus on the desired outcome under the aspect of\nits possibility, while a despairing subject focuses on the\noutcome under the aspect of its improbability (Chignell\nforthcoming).\n\nAccording to Meirav\u2019s \u201cExternal Factor Account\u201d\n(Meirav 2009: 230), hope also involves an attitude towards an external\nfactor (e.g., nature, fate, God) on which the realization of the\nhoped-for end causally depends. \u201cIf one views the external\nfactor as good, then one hopes for the prospect. If one views it as\nnot good, then one despairs of it\u201d (Meirav 2009: 230). However,\nit is doubtful whether Meirav\u2019s account is applicable to cases\nof hope where the realization of the outcome depends on luck (e.g.,\nhoping to win the lottery). Further, it seems that one might hope even\nin circumstances where one believes the external factor to be bad,\ne.g., in unjust political circumstances.\n\nWhile Meirav aims to answer the despair objection, Philip Pettit and\nCheshire Calhoun suggest solutions to the substantial hope objection.\nIn order to capture the motivating power of hope, Pettit distinguishes\nthe \u201csuperficial\u201d kind of hope described by the orthodox\ndefinition from a more \u201csubstantial\u201d hope (Pettit 2004:\n154). He construes substantial hope as acting on a belief that the\nagent does not really hold:\n\n\nHope will consist in acting as if a desired prospect is going to\nobtain or has a good chance of obtaining, just as precaution consists\nin acting as if this were the case with some feared prospect. (Pettit\n2004: 158)\n\n\nHowever, in typical cases, a hopeful person does not describe herself\nas acting as if the chances were higher, but as taking the\nchances as they are as good enough to try (Martin 2013: 23).\nCheshire Calhoun (2018) shares Adrienne Martin\u2019s criticism and argues\nthat we need to distinguish a \u2018planning idea\u2019 from a\n\u2018phenomenological idea\u2019 of the future: The third component\nof hope besides desire and belief, according to her, is \u201ca\nphenomenological idea of the determinate future whose content includes\nsuccess\u201d (Calhoun 2018: 86). This phenomenological idea,\nshe argues, has motivational effects independently of the\nagent\u2019s desires.\n\nAccording to Martin\u2019s suggestion (Martin 2013), hope involves\ntwo more elements in addition to belief and desire: First, the agent\nmust see or treat her belief about the possibility of the\noutcome\u2019s occurring as licensing hopeful activities,\ni.e., as not advising against some specific activities. Second, the\nagent must treat her attraction to the outcome as a practical\nreason to engage in the activities characteristic of hope. Martin\ncalls her account the Incorporation Thesis, which refers to\nthe fact that the hoping person incorporates the desire-element into\nher rational scheme of ends.\n\nMartin\u2019s proposal has been criticized as being overly reflective\nand unable to account for \u201crecalcitrant\u201d hopes where the\nhoping person does not see herself as justified in her\nhopeful activities (Milona and Stockdale 2018). Milona and Stockdale\noffer an account of hope that is inspired by the philosophy of\nemotions: They describe hope as a kind of perceptual state that\ninvolves a \u201chopeful\u201d feeling.\n\nThere is an ever-increasing number of accounts that aim to remedy the\nshortcomings of the standard definition (see also Kwong 2019,\nPalmqvist 2021). The discussion seems to come full circle with Michael\nMilona\u2019s return to the standard definition: Rather than\naugmenting the standard account, he suggests that one should employ a\nrich notion of desire and a suitable account of the relation\nbetween the desire and the belief\u2014the belief in the possibility\nof the outcome must be in the \u201ccognitive base\u201d of the\ndesire (Milona 2019).\n\nThe view that hope can be reduced to desires and beliefs (and a third\nfactor) is not without alternative, however. Segal and Textor (2015)\nargue that hope is a primitive mental state that can be\ncharacterized by its functional role; Bl\u00f6ser (2019) argues that hope\nis an irreducible concept. This latter view is compatible\nwith ontological variety and the view that different manifestations of\nhope are related in terms of family resemblance.\n\nAs for the norms of hope, there is consensus regarding the point that\nthere is a theoretical (or epistemic) and a practical aspect to the\nrationality of hope. On the theoretical side, the question is whether\nthe outcome is indeed possible (this amounts to evaluating hope in\nterms of its correctness) and whether the person is justified in her\ntaking the outcome to be possible (this amounts to evaluating hope in\nterms of justification or responsiveness to reasons). One question of\ndebate is whether the outcome must also be probable to a\ncertain degree in order for hope to be rational (for an affirmative\nanswer, see Moellendorf 2020 and Stockdale 2021). Andy Mueller\ncaptures the epistemic rationality of hope by specifying the idea that\n\u201choping that p\u201d is rationally incompatible with\n\u201cknowing that not-p\u201d (Mueller 2021: 45). (On the relation\nbetween hope and knowledge, see also Benton 2021).\n\nOn the practical side, most authors focus on the instrumental\nrationality of hope. Martin holds that hope is rational\n\u201cso long as it promotes her [the agent\u2019s] rational ends to\ndo these things [i.e. engage in hopeful activities such as acting to\npromote the end, fantasizing about the outcome, entertaining certain\nfeelings of anticipation]\u201d (Martin 2013). Similarly, Pettit\nemphasizes the instrumental value hope has for the pursuit of our ends\n(Pettit 2004: 161).\n\nHowever, the practical rationality of hope does not seem to be\nexhausted by instrumental considerations. Bovens argues that in\ncases where hoping has no instrumental value (because we cannot help\nbring about the desired state), hope can still have intrinsic\nvalue in virtue of its concomitant mental imaging: This characteristic\nof hope is responsible for its intrinsic value in three respects:\nFirst, hope has intrinsic value because the mental imaging connected to it (that is, the imaginative anticipation of the fulfillment of one\u2019s hope) is pleasurable\nin itself (Bovens 1999: 675f.). Second, hope has epistemic value\nbecause it increases one\u2019s self-understanding. Third, hope has\nintrinsic worth because it is constitutive of love towards others and\ntowards oneself, which are intrinsically valuable activities. It is in\nvirtue of mental imaging that hope is intimately connected to love,\nbecause spending mental energy in thinking about the well-being of\nanother person is constitutive of loving her. Bloeser and Stahl (2017)\nargue that certain hopes\u2014fundamental hopes\u2014can be rational\nin virtue of their contribution to the practical identity of the\nhoping person.\n\nFinally, it is a matter of debate how the theoretical and the\npractical dimension of rationality are related. On Martin\u2019s\naccount, the practical dimension has priority. Miriam Schleiffer\nMcCormick, by contrast, holds that the theoretical and practical\ndimensions equally contribute to hope\u2019s overall rationality and\nare intertwined (McCormick 2017).\n\nAnother approach to the value of hope explores the prospects of\nunderstanding hope as a virtue. Michael Milona interprets hope as a\nmoral virtue along the lines of \u201cgetting one\u2019s\npriorities straight\u201d (Milona 2020b). (For another attempt to\nunderstand hope as a moral virtue, see Han-Pile/Stern, forthcoming;\nfor a critical view of such an enterprise, see Bobier 2018.) Michael\nLamb aims to apply the structure of Thomas Aquinas\u2019 theological\nvirtue of hope to argue that hope can be a democratic virtue\nthat perfects acts of hoping in fellow citizens to achieve democratic\ngoods (Lamb 2016). Nancy Snow (2013) proposes that hope can be\nunderstood as an intellectual virtue. (For a critical\nassessment of Snow\u2019s approach, see Cobb 2015.)\n\nAccounts of hope as a virtue suggest that not all instances of hope\ncan be described as \u201chope that p\u201d, i.e., as\npropositional hopes that the standard definition and its successors\naim to analyze. There are two kinds of non-propositional hope that are\nsubject to debate (see Rioux 2021): First, as Lamb\u2019s account\nsuggests, we might have hope in a person, which Adrienne\nMartin calls \u201cinterpersonal hope\u201d (Martin 2020). Second,\nit has been suggested that there is an attitude of indeterminate hope\nthat is able to survive the loss of particular, determinate hopes. The\ndistinction between \u201chope that\u201d and hope without a\ndeterminate object has been introduced into the philosophical\ndiscourse by Gabriel Marcel and has recently been taken up (with or\nwithout explicit reference to Marcel) by otherwise different accounts.\nJoseph Godfrey calls hope without object \u201cfundamental\nhope\u201d and bases his account on an analysis of Bloch, Kant and\nMarcel (Godfrey 1987). Patrick Shade\u2019s pragmatist theory\ndistinguishes particular hopes and hopefulness as \u201can openness\nto possibilities that are meaningful and promising for us\u201d\n(Shade 2001: 139). Jonathan Lear similarly describes \u201cradical\nhope\u201d as a sense of a future in which \u201csomething good will\nemerge\u201d (Lear 2006: 94), even though all particular hopes were\ndestroyed; and Matthew Ratcliffe takes such radical hope as an\ninstance of \u201cpre-intentional hope\u201d, which is\n\n\na kind of general orientation or sense of how things are with the\nworld, in the context of which intentional states of the kind \u201cI\nhope that p\u201d are possible. (Ratcliffe 2013: 602)\n\n4. Analyses of Hope in the Psychological Literature\n\nPsychologists and psychoanalysts have systematically investigated hope\nsince the 1950s (Frank 1968, for an overview, see Gallagher et al.\n2020). In many of these first studies, hope was seen as a cognitive\nprocess of directing agency that rests on the perception of an outcome\nas important for an agent to achieve and as having a certain\nprobability (Stotland 1969). While this understanding of hope deviates\nfrom the standard philosophical account (see section 3) by requiring a\nminimal probability, it continues to play a major role in the current\npsychological literature.\n\nCurrently, the most influential psychological approach to hope is\nCharles Snyder\u2019s hope theory (for an overview, see Rand and\nCheavens 2009). Snyder defines hope as follows:\n\n\nWithin a goal-setting framework, we propose that there are two major,\ninterrelated elements of hope. First, we hypothesize that hope is\nfueled by the perception of successful agency related to goals. The\nagency component refers to a sense of successful determination in\nmeeting goals in the past, present, and future. Second, we hypothesize\nthat hope is influenced by the perceived availability of successful\npathways related to goals. (Snyder et al. 1991: 570)\n\n\nOn this basis, Snyder and others have developed various measures of\nhope, such as the Adult Hope Scale (ibid.), and the State Hope\nScale (Snyder et al. 1996) that have received strong\nexperimental support and are widely used globally (see Gallagher et\nal. 2020: 193\u2013196 and Rose and Sieben 2018 for discussion of other\nmeasures).\n\nSeveral objections have been raised against Snyder\u2019s analysis of\nhope. One is that the \u201cperception of agency\u201d relates both\nto the past and the future and therefore measures a general trait of\nhopefulness rather than the hope for specific outcomes. As a response,\npsychologists have developed further \u201cdomain-specific\u201d\nhope scales (Lopez et al. 2000: 61). A second question concerns the\nissue of whether Snyder\u2019s definition of hope is sufficiently\ndistinct from optimism (see Miceli and Castelfranchi 2010; Aspinwall\nand Leaf 2002). Snyder wants to distinguish hope from optimism by\nlinking hope to beliefs about self-efficacy (Snyder 2002; Snyder, Rand\nand Sigmon 2018; Magaletta and Oliver 1999) and reserving the term\n\u201coptimism\u201d for generalized expectations about positive\noutcomes. However, the ordinary use of the term is better captured by\nthe idea that hope can be upheld even if one does not assign a high\nprobability to the outcome.\n5. Hope in Political Philosophy\n\nHope can play three distinct roles in politics (see Stahl 2020): It\ncan be instrumentally valuable insofar as its motivating influence\nmakes it more likely that people achieve politically desirable goals.\nIt can also be constitutive of politics, in that it is necessary for\ncertain hopes to be present for the space of the political to emerge\nat all. For example, Spinoza argues that citizens can only act\ntogether politically if they have civic hope, through which they see\neach other as sources of potential benefits (Steinberg 2018: 90).\nLastly, hope can also play a justificatory role, insofar it is\npossible that certain policies can only be publicly justified by\nreference to hopes that those promoting them reasonably entertain.\n\nThe potential for hope to both motivate and mislead is widely\ndiscussed in ancient and modern philosophy, but systematic accounts of\nthe political relevance of hope stem only from the 20th century (for\nan overview, see Bl\u00f6ser, Huber and Moellendorf 2020). Many of these\ncontributions can be understood as raising questions about the\npossible justifications of being guided in one\u2019s political\nagency by hope, on the one hand, and about the benefits and risks of\nhope for politics on the other.\n\nRegarding the first question about the justification of hope, one of\nthe earliest and most ambitious accounts can be found in Ernst\nBloch\u2019s The Principle of Hope. Bloch advances his\nargument in the context of a debate in early 20th-century Marxism,\ndistinguishing between what he calls the \u201ccold\u201d and the\n\u201cwarm stream\u201d: The first designates the materialist\ninsight that all historical developments are conditioned and\nconstrained by concrete, existing material conditions, \u201cstrict\ndeterminations that cannot be skipped over\u201d (Bloch\n[1954\u201359] 1986: I:208), whereas the second acknowledges a\nprocessual constitution of reality which is captured by hope. Hope, in\nother words, is justified by its correctly grasping facts about the\nworld. In particular, Bloch describes hope as always related to the\n\u201cnot-yet-conscious\u201d that in turn reflects \u201cobjective\npossibilities\u201d. This idea is related to Bloch\u2019s processual\nmetaphysics, according to which objective tendencies and possibilities\ninteract with \u201cclosed\u201d matters of fact, such that the\nmoment of potentiality surpassing into actuality always opens up\nopportunities for the interventions of active decision-making. The\nright way to relate to these opportunities is, according to Bloch,\n\u201cmilitant optimism\u201d, i.e., not a mere assumption that\nthings will develop in a desirable direction, but an active attitude\ntowards real tendencies with the goal to realize them (Bloch\n[1954\u201359] 1986: I:201). Arguing from these premises, Bloch\ndevelops an integrated theory in which hope is not merely a subjective\ncombination of desires and beliefs about probabilities or facts, but\nrather a reflection of metaphysical possibilities in the world and\npart of a range of human capacities that make it possible to relate to\nthat which is not yet, but which is already prefigured in the\nobjective potentials of reality.\n\nWhile most contemporary political philosophers acknowledge that many\nof our political hopes are grounded in reality, few go as far as Bloch\nto also see a general attitude of hopefulness as justified by\nmetaphysical considerations. In Law of Peoples, Rawls, for\nexample, holds that political theories need to develop a\n\u201crealistic utopia\u201d of justice to reliably guide our\npolitical agency and to \u201csupport and strengthen\u201d our\npolitical hopes (Rawls 2003: 23). Howard (2019: 300) argues that such\na utopia refers to an outcome that is possible and reachable under\nfavorable conditions, but which may be extremely improbable\nnevertheless. Following Kant, Rawls seems to assume that the main\njustification for our political hopes for justice seems to come from\nthe fact that we need such hopes to be able to continue to be moved by\nconsiderations of justice, and that it would be unreasonable to give\nup political hope for that reason. Bourke (forthcoming) takes a\ncloser look at the similarities and differences between Kant and Rawls\nregarding their justifications of belief and hope.\n\nIn similar terms, some contemporary authors think of a disposition to\nhave certain hopes as a democratic virtue that can be fostered or\nundermined by states. Moellendorf (2006) makes an argument to this\neffect that is restricted to societies transitioning from severe\ninjustice towards justice: Because citizens need hopes to be\nmotivationally capable to engage in the risky activities necessary to\npursue societal change, and because hopes for a more just future can\nsupport their self-respect under unjust circumstances, institutions of\ntransitional societies must supply the \u201cinstitutional bases of\nhope\u201d, such as possibilities for free political campaigning and\nopen debate. Snow (2018: 414) argues that societies that do not offer\ncitizens \u201csecure attachment\u201d create \u201cworrier\u201d\ncitizens that are more likely to succumb to paranoid nationalism,\nwhereas \u201ccarers\u201d who are hopeful citizens are more likely\nto embrace a more inclusive national identity. More narrowly, Snow\ndefines \u201ccivic hope\u201d as an \u201centrenched disposition\nof openness to the political possibilities a democratic government can\nprovide. Hope must include the belief that the ends of democracy are\npossible\u201d (2018: 419) and argues\u2014drawing on the pragmatist\ntradition (see section 2.6 above)\u2014that this disposition is a\nvirtue that contributes to the flourishing of their lives as citizens\nas well as of the state they live in.\n\nWhile most contemporary liberal views follow these arguments in\nreplacing Bloch\u2019s metaphysical foundations of hope with moral\njustifications, defenders of \u201cunjustifiable\u201d political\nhope, such as Richard Rorty, argue for the more radical claim that we\ncannot, as a matter of principle, provide any fundamental\njustification for the desirability of the outcomes that we hope for.\nAs Rorty famously rejects the idea of a political philosophy that is\nbased on privileged knowledge or insight, he argues that\n\u201cliberal hope\u201d (i.e., hope for the emergence and\nsustenance of liberal societies) similarly cannot be based on any\nfoundations\u2014such as knowledge about probabilities. Rather, it is\nan attitude by which those who have it express their commitment to\ncertain forms of future interaction and their belief in their\npossibility. In Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity, Rorty\ncorrespondingly contrasts two forms of liberalism: The \u201cliberal\nmetaphysician\u201d expects social cooperation to be based on\nscientific or philosophical insight that penetrates individual\nidiosyncrasy and aims at the adoption of a universal, final vocabulary\nthat then leads to solidarity. By contrast, the \u201cliberal\nironist\u201d renounces the idea of a final vocabulary and instead\nassumes that only the contingent overlap between \u201cselfish\nhopes\u201d can be a source of the solidarity that grounds the\ncommitment to liberal principles (Rorty 1989: 93). As Smith (2005)\nnotes, Rorty does not intend to argue for unjustified hope (hope for\nwhich there is no adequate justification, although such justification\nis possible). Rather, he must refer to a form of hope for which the\nquestion of an ultimate justification does not arise, since it does\nnot incorporate the idea that it is based on any such\njustification.\n\nWhile the authors surveyed so far all agree on a positive role of hope\nin politics, there is also a more skeptical tradition in political\nthought that either questions whether hope in the standard sense is\nalways available to political agents or argues that, at least\nsometimes, hope ought to be abandoned for political reasons.\n\nOne set of arguments revolves around whether the positive aspects of\npolitical hope are accessible to everyone as classic liberal accounts\nof hope seem to assume. Stockdale (2021) argues that many hopes of\nmembers of oppressed groups are not forms of pleasurable anticipation,\nbut \u201cfearful hope\u201d, that is, hope for avoiding the worst\neffects of their oppression. In this sense, hope is not always\nsomething that ought to be preserved. Of course, this does not exclude\nmore positive hopes, such as hoping for a less oppressive future. A\nmore radical challenge to the idea that specific, objectual hopes are\nalways available as a response to injustice is to be found in\nLear\u2019s (2006) reflections on \u201cradical hope\u201d. Lear\nconsiders a situation\u2014such as that which members of the Crow\nnation may have faced after they were forced to live on reservations\nand, as a consequence, their traditional form of life became\nimpossible\u2014where, as a result of historical catastrophe, the\nvocabulary with which a group makes sense of the good collapses, and\nthe only thing they can hope for is that a new version of a good life\nwill become possible\u2014a version they currently lack the words to\nconceptualize.\n\nA second, skeptical argument is concerned with the objection that hope\nin politics might serve to encourage wishful thinking or undermine a\nrealistic, critical evaluation of social reality (see Bl\u00f6ser, Huber\nand Moellendorf 2020 for an overview): It is often equated with\noptimism (see Eagleton 2015 for an argument that does not do so) and\nthus a naive approach to politics. It is said to disempower since hope\ninvolves seeing the outcome as dependent on factors beyond one\u2019s\ncontrol, and to misdirect our agency towards Utopian goals. As\nMoellendorf (2019: 154) argues, all hope imposes opportunity costs,\nsince it precludes alternative attitudes which may be more\ninstrumentally valuable. Political realists (such as Sleat 2013) argue\nthat hope may be a necessary element of politics, but will by\nnecessity go beyond that which is actually possible and thus mislead\nour political agency. Although these arguments draw attention to the\ndangers of hope in politics that have to be taken seriously, a\nbalanced judgment must also take into account the dimensions of value\ndiscussed above. Indeed, philosophers working in the field of climate\nchange often emphasize the instrumental value of hope in sustaining\naction where the attainment of the ultimate goal\u2014managing\nclimate change\u2014is uncertain (McKinnon 2014, Roser 2019).\nMoellendorf highlights the need to develop hopeful politics when\ndiscussing climate issues (Moellendorf 2022).\n\nA third argument finally confronts the fundamental issue of whether\nhope and hopefulness are always as desirable in politics as much of\nthe preceding arguments have assumed. Warren (2015), for example,\nargues that the discourse and the valuation of political hope in Black\nAmerican politics, serves to appropriate a theological notion of hope\nand uses it to enforce a \u201ccompulsory investment\u201d of Black\npeople\u2019s hope in the political\u2014although the resulting\npolitics only prolongs and reinforces the racist structures towards\nthe ending of which their political hope is ostensibly directed.\nInstead, Warren advocates for \u201cBlack nihilism\u201d, that is,\nthe rejection of the metaphysical and political framework in which\npolitical hope operates (see Lloyd 2018, Winters 2019 for discussion).\nBut even Warren leaves space for \u201cspiritual hope\u201d as a\nhope for the end of political hope.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aristotle, <em>The Nicomachean Ethics</em>, D.
