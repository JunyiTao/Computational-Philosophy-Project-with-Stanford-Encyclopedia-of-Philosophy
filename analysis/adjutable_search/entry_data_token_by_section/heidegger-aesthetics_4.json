    "main_text": "Heidegger\u2019s Philosophical Critique of Aesthetics: Introduction || Heidegger\u2019s Critique of the Aesthetic Approach\n2.2 Heidegger\u2019s Critique of the Aesthetic Approach\n\n\nIn a provocatively-titled essay delivered in 1938, \u201cThe Age of\nthe World Picture,\u201d Heidegger provides a succinct formulation of\nwhat it means to approach art aesthetically that helps us reach the\ncore of his objection to aesthetics. When \u201cart gets pushed\ninto the horizon of aesthetics,\u201d he writes, this\n\n\nmeans [1] that the artwork becomes an object of lived experience\n[Gegenstand des Erlebens], and [2] in this way art comes to\ncount as an expression of human life [Lebens]. (QCT\n116/GA5 75)\n\n\nHeidegger is making two connected points here (which are numbered\naccordingly). The first is that when art is understood and\napproached \u201caesthetically,\u201d artworks become\nobjects for human subjects to experience in an especially\nintense, vital, or meaningful way. We can see this if we unpack\nhis typically dense language: As Heidegger frequently points out,\nin the modern, post-Cartesian world, an \u201cobject,\u201d\nGegenstand, is something that \u201cstands opposite\u201d a\nhuman subject, something external to subjectivity. In\norder to experience an object, the modern subject supposedly must first\nget outside the immanent sphere of its own subjectivity so as to\nencounter this \u201cexternal\u201d object, and then return back to\nits subjective sphere bearing the fruits of this encounter. Given\nthe modern subject/object dichotomy, such an adventure beyond\nsubjectivity and back again is required for the experience of any\nobject. But in the case of the art object, Heidegger is pointing\nout, the adventure beyond subjectivity and back again is a particularly\nintense, meaningful, or enlivening one: A \u201clived\nexperience\u201d is an experience that makes us feel \u201cmore\nalive,\u201d as Heidegger suggests by emphasizing the etymological\nconnection between Erleben and Lebens, \u201clived\nexperience\u201d and \u201clife.\u201d\n\n\nThe second point Heidegger is trying to make is that when artworks\nbecome objects for subjects to have particularly meaningful experiences\nof, these artworks themselves also get understood thereby as meaningful\nexpressions of an artistic subject\u2019s own life experiences.\nHeidegger does not ever develop any argument for this point; the\nthought simply seems to be that once aesthetics understands artworks as\nobjects of which we can have meaningful experiences, it is only logical\nto conceive of these art objects themselves in an isomorphic way, as\nmeaningful expressions of the lives of the artists who created\nthem. Still, this alleged isomorphism of aesthetic\n\u201cexpression and impression\u201d is not immediately\n obvious.[15]\nThink,\nfor example, about the seriously playful \u201cfound art\u201d\ntradition in Surrealism, dada, Fluxus, and their heirs, a tradition in\nwhich ordinary objects get seditiously appropriated as\n\u201cart.\u201d (The continuing influence of Marcel\nDuchamp\u2019s \u201creadymade\u201d remains visible in everything\nfrom Andy Warhol\u2019s meticulously reconstructed\n \u201cBrillo Boxes\u201d\n(1964) to Ruben Ochoa\u2019s\nlarge-scale installations of industrial detritus such as broken\nconcrete, rebar, and chain-link fencing, such as\n \u201cIdeal Disjuncture\u201d\n(2008). Vattimo thus suggests that\nDuchamp\u2019s \u201cFountain\u201d illustrates the way an artwork\ncan disclose a new world, a world in which high art comes to celebrate\nnot only the trivial and ordinary but also the vulgar and even\nthe\n obscene.)[16]\nThis tradition initially seems like a\nseries of deliberate counter-examples to the aesthetic assumption that\nartworks are meaningful expressions of an artist\u2019s own\nsubjectivity.\n\n\nEven in this tradition, however, the artists\u2019 appropriations\nare never truly random but invariably require some selection,\npresentation, and the like, and thus inevitably reopen interpretive\nquestions about the significance these art objects have for the\nartistic subject who chose them. (Why this particular object?\nWhy present it in just this way?) It is thus not surprising\nthat the founding work of found \u201canti-art,\u201d\nDuchamp\u2019s\n \u201cFountain\u201d\n(1917)\u2014his deliciously seditious\ninstallation of a deliberately inverted, humorously signed (by\n\u201cR. Mutt\u201d), and brilliantly re-titled urinal in an art\ngallery\u2014is typically treated in contemporary aesthetics as an\nextreme expression of Duchamp\u2019s own artistic subjectivity, not as\nits\n absence.[17]\nHere one could also point to the\nfailure of Robert Rauschenberg\u2019s attempt to deconstruct the found\nart ideal of unique and spontaneous invention in his incredible\n\u201ccombines,\u201d\n \u201cFactum I and Factum II,\u201d\nworks which, despite\nRauschenberg\u2019s painstaking efforts to make them identical, instead\nwork to suggest the stubborn uniqueness of any given artwork. So, even\nthe found art tradition of the readymade and its heirs reinforces\nHeidegger\u2019s point that, in the basic aesthetic approach to art,\nart objects are implicitly understood as meaningful expressions of\nartists\u2019 lives that are capable of eliciting particularly intense or\nmeaningful experiences in viewing subjects.\n\n\nIn this aesthetic approach, to put it simply, art objects\nexpress and intensify human subjects\u2019 experiences of\nlife. What Heidegger thus characterizes as the aesthetic\napproach to art will probably seem so obvious to most people that it\ncan be hard to see what he could possibly find objectionable about\nit. Art objects express and intensify human subjects\u2019\nexperiences of life; to many people, it might not even be clear what it\ncould mean to understand art in any other way. How should we\nunderstand and approach art, if not in terms of the meaningful\nexperiences that a subject might have of some art object, an art object\nwhich is itself a meaningful expression of the life of the artist (or\nartists) who created it? What exactly does Heidegger think is\nwrong with this \u201cpicture\u201d of art?\n\n\nDespite what one might expect from a phenomenologist like Heidegger,\nhis objection is not that the aesthetic view mischaracterizes the way\nwe late moderns ordinarily experience \u201cart.\u201d On the\ncontrary, Heidegger clearly thinks that what he characterizes as\n\u201cthe increasingly aesthetic fundamental position taken toward art\nas a whole\u201d (N1 88/GA43 103) does accurately describe the\nexperiences of art that take place\u2014when they do take\nplace\u2014in museums, art galleries, and installations; in\nperformance spaces, theaters, and movie houses; in cathedrals,\ncoliseums, and other ruins; in cityscapes as well as landscapes; in\nconcert halls, music clubs, and comic books; even when we listen to\nour speakers, headphones, ear-buds; and, sometimes (who could credibly deny\nit?), when we sit in front of our television screens, computer\nmonitors, iPhones, and so on. The experiences we have of what\nrises to the level of \u201cart\u201d in all such settings are indeed\n\u201caesthetic\u201d experiences, that is, particularly intense or\nmeaningful experiences that make us feel more alive; and, if we think\nabout it, we do tend to approach these art objects as expressions of\nthe life of the artists who created them. The aesthetic view\ncorrectly characterizes our typical experience of \u201cart\u201d in\nthe contemporary world\u2014and for Heidegger that is part of\nthe\n problem.[18]\n",
