The 1936 Thesis and its Context\n\nThe Church-Turing thesis concerns the concept of an effective\nor systematic or mechanical method, as used in\nlogic, mathematics and computer science. \u201cEffective\u201d and\nits synonyms \u201csystematic\u201d and \u201cmechanical\u201d are\nterms of art in these disciplines: they do not carry their everyday\nmeaning. A method, or procedure, \\(M\\), for achieving some desired\nresult is called \u201ceffective\u201d (or \u201csystematic\u201d\nor \u201cmechanical\u201d) just in case:\n\n\\(M\\) is set out in terms of a finite number of exact instructions\n(each instruction being expressed by means of a finite number of\nsymbols);\n\\(M\\) will, if carried out without error, produce the desired\nresult in a finite number of steps;\n\\(M\\) can (in practice or in principle) be carried out by a human\nbeing unaided by any machinery except paper and pencil;\n\\(M\\) demands no insight, intuition, or ingenuity, on the part of\nthe human being carrying out the method.\n\n\nA well-known example of an effective method is the truth-table test\nfor tautologousness. In principle, a human being who works by rote\ncould apply this test successfully to any formula of the propositional\ncalculus\u2014given sufficient time, tenacity, paper, and pencils\n(although in practice the test is unworkable for any formula\ncontaining more than a few propositional variables).\n",
