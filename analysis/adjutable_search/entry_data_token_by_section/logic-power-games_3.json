    "main_text": "The Basic Ingredients || Choices\n2.2 Choices\n\nA game is also a description of what players can achieve, on their own\nor within coalitions. To formalize this we use effectivity functions,\nan abstract model of power introduced to study voting strategies in\ncommittees (Moulin & Peleg 1982).\n\nAn effectivity function (Moulin & Peleg 1982) is\na function \n\\[E:2^{N} \\to 2^{2^{W}}\\]\n\n\nassociating to each group of players a set of sets of outcomes.\n\nThe idea is that, whenever it is the case that \\(X\\in E(C)\\), then\ncoalition \\(C\\) is able to decide that the outcome of the game lies\ninside the set \\(X\\), and can therefore rule out the outcomes \\(W\n\\setminus X\\) from being eventually chosen. In other words \\(X\\) is\nwithin the power of coalition \\(C\\).\n\nEffectivity functions of games are closed under\nsupersets, i.e., we have that \\(X\\in E(C)\\) and \\(X\\subseteq\nY \\subseteq W\\) imply that \\(Y \\in E(C)\\). In other words, if \\(X\\) is\nwithin the power of coalition \\(C\\) then so is each of \\(X\\)\u2019s\nsupersets. From this, notice, it follows that if an effectivity\nfunction of a certain coalition is not empty then it always contains\nthe set of all outcomes.\n\nFor \\(\\mathcal{X} \\subseteq {2^{W}}\\) we denote \\(\\mathcal{X}^{+}\\)\nits superset closure.\n\n\nExample 4. Going back to the main example, consider\nthe power of each individual country. Because of the rules of the\ngame, no country is alone in position to rule out any outcome.\n\nResorting to effectivity functions: for each \\(i\\in N\\), we have that\n\\(E(\\{i\\}) = \\{W\\}\\).\n\nThis is however also the case for coalitions that are not big enough.\nFor instance, take all coalitions of at least two Countries that can\nbe formed between The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nE(\\{\\mbox{Luxembourg, Belgium}\\}) &= \\\\\n E(\\{\\mbox{Luxembourg, The Netherlands}\\}) &= \\\\\n E(\\{\\mbox{Belgium, The Netherlands}\\}) &= \\\\\n E(\\{\\mbox{Luxembourg, Belgium, The Netherlands}\\}) &= \\{W\\}. \n\\end{align*} \\]\n\n\nBecause their total weight sums to at most to 5 votes, they are not,\non their own, able to settle for or rule out any possible agreement.\nIn fact, for acts proposed by the Commission, each coalition \\(C\\)\nwhose voting weight is not at least 12 has the same effectivity\nfunction \\(E(C) = \\{W\\}\\).\n\nFor the other coalitions, the situation is different. Consider for\ninstance the coalition made by France, Germany and Italy, which,\ntogether, have a voting weight of 12. For them we have that:\n\n\\[E(\\{\\textrm{France, Germany, Italy}\\}) = \\{\\{w\\} \\mid w \\in W\\}^{+}\\]\n\n\nThis means that the three members can, on their own, decide the\noutcome of the vote. This is true for every coalition of voting weight\n12 or more.\n\nWhat about the acts not proposed by the Commission? For them let us\nuse a different effectivity function, which we label \\(E^{*}\\).\n\nIn this case the winning coalition has to consist of at least four\nmembers.\n\nSo \\(E^{*}(\\{\\mbox{France, Germany, Italy}\\}) = \\{W\\}\\) while\n\\(E^{*}(\\{\\)France, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands\\(\\}) = \\{\\{w\\}\n\\mid w \\in W\\}^{+}\\).\n\nIn general, it holds that \\(E(C)=E^{*}(C)\\) whenever \\(|C|\\geq 4\\).\nBecause of the properties of the voting game, we also have that\n\\(E(C)=E^{*}(C)\\) whenever \\(|C|\\leq 2\\). The difference is made by\ncoalitions of size 3: with \\(E^{*}\\), they can never achieve more than\n\\(\\{W\\}\\), while with \\(E\\) they can achieve \\(\\{\\{w\\} \\mid w \\in\nW\\}^{+}\\), if their voting power is at least 12. Notice that\nLuxembourg is irrelevant when it comes to bills proposed by the\nCommission, i.e., \\(E(C) = E(C \\cup \\textrm{ Luxembourg})\\). This is\nnot the case for the other bills, as we have observed.\n\n\nProperties of effectivity functions can be expressed in modal logic.\nTo do so it is important to observe that a dynamic\neffectivity function, essentially an effectivity function in each\nstate of the model, corresponds to a (non-normal) relation in a\nrelational structure. So what effectivity functions do is to induce a\nspecial kind of neighborhood structure, which we refer to as\nCoalition Model.\n\n\nDefinition 6 [Coalition Models]. A Coalition\nModel is a triple \\((W,E, V)\\) where:\n\n\\(W\\) is a nonempty set of states;\n\\(E: W \\longrightarrow (2^{N} \\longrightarrow 2^{2^W})\\) is a\ndynamic effectivity function;\n\\(V: W \\longrightarrow 2^{\\texttt{Atoms}}\\) is a valuation\nfunction.\n\n\n\nA coalition frame is a model without the valuation function.\nCoalition models are, of course, relational game structures in\ndisguise. As the reader will notice, dynamic effectivity functions\nallow each state to possibly have different power distributions among\ncoalitions. This is strictu sensu irrelevant for the\ntreatment of power in games\n (Section 3),\n where the effectivity functions associated to outcomes could as well\nbe taken to be equivalent everywhere in the model, but the model is\ngeneral enough to treat extensive and repeated interaction, where the\nsequential structure of the interaction is defined explicitly. We will\nusually abbreviate \\(E(w)(C)\\) as \\(E_w(C)\\) or even \\(E(C)\\) when\nclear from the context.\n\nThe language used to talk about Coalition Models is Coalition\nLogic (Pauly 2001), a non-normal modal logic to express\nchoices of groups of players. Coalition Logic is an extension of\npropositional logic with \\(|2^{N}|\\) modalities of the form \\([C]\\),\nso a modal operator each indexed with a coalition.\n\nThe satisfaction relation of the formulas of the form \\([C]\\varphi\\)\nwith respect to a pair \\(M,w\\) is defined as follows: \n\\[M,w\\models [C]\\varphi \\enskip\\textrm{if and only if}\\enskip \\varphi^M\\in E_w(C) \\]\n\n\nwhere, \\(\\varphi^M = \\{w\\in W \\mid M,w\\models\\varphi\\}\\).\n\nIntuitively \\(\\varphi^M\\in E_w(C)\\) means that coalition \\(C\\) is able\nto achieve property \\(\\varphi\\).\n\nAs closure under superset, or outcome monotonicity,\nis taken to be a property of all effectivity functions, the rule of\nmonotonicity is valid in Coalition Logic, which is therefore a\nmonotonic modal logic (Hansen 2003).\n\nThe rule of monotonicity takes this form for each \\(C\\subseteq\nN\\): \n\\[\\frac{\\varphi \\to \\psi}{[C]\\varphi \\to [C]\\psi}\\]\n\n\nIntuitively, if \\(C\\) is able to achieve \\(\\varphi\\) and we have that\n\\(\\varphi\\) implies \\(\\psi\\), then \\(C\\) is also able to achieve\n\\(\\psi\\).\n\nMathematical properties of power Apart from outcome\nmonotonicity, many other properties can be deemed necessary to model\ncoalitional power in games. For instance an effectivity function\ntypically has the following properties:\n\n\nliveness: i.e., \\(\\emptyset \\not\\in E(C)\\), for\neach \\(C\\subseteq N\\);\nsafety: i.e., \\(W \\in E(C)\\), for each\n\\(C\\subseteq N\\);\nregularity: i.e., \\(X \\in E(C)\\) implies that\n\\(\\overline{X} \\not\\in E(\\overline{C})\\), for each \\(C\\subseteq N, X\n\\subseteq W\\);\nN-maximality: i.e., \\(\\overline{X} \\in\nE(\\emptyset)\\) implies that \\({X} \\in E(N)\\) and \\(X \\subseteq\nW\\);\nsuperadditivity: i.e., \\(X\\in E(C)\\) and \\(Y \\in\nE(D)\\) implies that \\(X\\cap Y \\in E(C \\cup D)\\), for each \\(C\\), \\(D\n\\subseteq N\\), \\(C \\cap D = \\emptyset\\), \\(X,Y \\subseteq W\\);\ncoalition monotonicity: i.e., \\(X \\in E(C)\\)\nimplies that \\(X \\in E(D)\\), for each \\(C\\subseteq D \\subseteq N\\),\n\\(X \\subseteq W\\);\nwell-foundedness: i.e., \\(X \\in E(N)\\) implies\nthat \\(\\{x\\} \\in E(N)\\), for some \\(x \\in X\\), for each \\(X \\subseteq\nW\\).\n\n\n\nAn effectivity function is called playable (Pauly\n2001) if it has liveness, safety, N-maximality and\nsuperadditivity. It is called truly playable\n(Goranko, Jamroga, & Turrini 2013) if it is playable and\nwell-founded. Observe that if \\(W\\) is finite, an effectivity function\nis playable if and only if it is truly playable (Goranko et\nal. 2013).\n\nTrue playability is a fundamental property of effectivity functions of\ngames, and connects one-shot coalitional games to one-shot\nnon-cooperative games, as will be clear later.\n\nExample 5. The effectivity functions of our working\nexample are all truly playable.\n\nIn neighborhood structures, relations between set-theoretical and\nlogical properties are often immediate and standard correspondence\nresults between class of frames and neighborhood functions (Chellas\n1980) can be automatically used for Coalition Logic.\n\nCoalition Logic is in fact expressive enough to characterize all the\nconstraints mentioned so far, except the last one.\n\n\nProposition 7. Let \\(F=(W,E)\\) be a Coalition Frame,\nand \\(C,C^{\\prime}, C''\\) be coalitions, such that \\(C \\cap\nC'=\\emptyset\\) and \\(C \\subseteq C''\\). The following results\nhold:\n\n\\(\\models_F [C] \\varphi \\to \\neg [\\overline{C}]\\neg \\varphi\\) if\nand only if \\(E\\) is regular;\n\\(\\models_F [C]\\top\\) if and only if \\(E\\) has safety;\n\\(\\models_F [C] \\varphi \\to [C'']\\varphi\\) if and only if \\(E\\) is\ncoalition monotonic;\n\\(\\models_F \\neg [C] \\bot\\) if and only if \\(E\\) has\nliveness;\n\\(\\models_F \\neg [\\emptyset] \\neg \\varphi \\to [N]\\varphi\\) if and\nonly if \\(E\\) is N-maximal;\n\\(\\models_F [C^{\\prime}] \\varphi \\wedge [C]\\psi \\to [C^{\\prime}\n\\cup C](\\varphi \\wedge \\psi)\\) if and only if \\(E\\) is\nsuperadditive;\n\\(\\varphi \\to \\psi \\models_F [C]\\varphi \\to [C]\\psi\\) if and only\nif \\(E\\) is outcome monotonic.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the axioms and deduction rule above are, in addition to\npropositional logic, sound and complete with respect to the class of\nall models with playable effectivity functions. For proofs, consult\nPauly 2001.\n\nCorrespondence results allow us to distinguish by modal means a number\nof classes of frames. However expressivity of the modal operators\nstrongly limit the capacity of the language to discern classes of\nstructures. To this extent the reader should notice that the logics of\nboth playable and truly playable effectivity frames share the fact\nthat \\(\\models_F [\\emptyset]\\top\\). However this proposition, whose\ninterpretation is that for each \\(w\\in W, \\{W\\} \\in E_w(\\emptyset)\\),\nis not sufficient to make a formal distinction between\n\\(E_w(\\emptyset)\\) in the two different classes of effectivity\nfunctions.\n\nAlong these lines, the following result tells us that Coalition Logic\nis also strong enough to reason about (or, if you prefer, too weak to\ndistinguish) truly playable effectivity functions.\n\nTheorem 8. (Goranko et al. 2013) Let\n\\(\\mathcal{P}\\) be the class of playable frames and\n\\(\\mathcal{P}^{*}\\) the class of truly playable ones. Then, for every\nformula of Coalition Logic \\(\\varphi\\) \n\\[\\models_\\mathcal{P} \\varphi \\textrm{ if and only if } \\models_{\\mathcal{P}^{*}} \\varphi\\]\n\n\nThis follows from the fact that Playable Coalition Logic has the\nfinite model property (Pauly 2001) and, in finite models, playable\neffectivity functions are truly\n playable.[5]\n\nAs pointed out earlier on, this entry will only mention how knowledge\nis implicit in game structures but will not delve into the study of\nepistemic preconditions of rational play. Related entries devoted to\n epistemic logic,\n dynamic epistemic logic, and in particular\n epistemic game theory\n explore in depth the role of knowledge in decision-making. A\ntreatment of modal logics for games which focuses instead on the role\nof information is Hoek & Pauly 2006.\n",
