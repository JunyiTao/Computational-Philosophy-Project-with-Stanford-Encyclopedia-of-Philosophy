    "main_text": "The Attraction of Pluralism || Value Conflicts and Rational Regret\n2.2 Value Conflicts and Rational Regret\n\nMichael Stocker (1990) and Bernard Williams (1973 and 1981) and others\nhave argued that it can be rational to regret the outcome of a correct\nmoral choice. That is, even when the right choice has been made, the\nrejected option can reasonably be regretted, and so the choice\ninvolves a genuine value conflict. This seems strange if the options\nare being compared in terms of a supervalue. How can we regret having\nchosen more rather than less of the same thing? Yet the phenomenon\nseems undeniable, and pluralism can explain it. If there are plural\nvalues, then one can rationally regret not having chosen something\nwhich though less good, was different.\n\nIt is worth noting that the pluralist argument is not that all cases\nof value conflict point to pluralism. There may be conflicts because\nof ignorance, for example, or because of irrationality, and these do\nnot require positing plural values. Stocker argues that there are (at\nleast) two sorts of value conflict that require plural values. The\nfirst is conflict that involves choices between doing things at\ndifferent times. Stocker argues that goods become different values in\ndifferent temporal situations, and the monist cannot accommodate this\nthought. The other sort of case (which Williams also points to) is\nwhen there is a conflict between things that have different advantages\nand disadvantages. The better option may be better, but it does not\n\u2018make up for\u2019 the lesser option, because it isn\u2019t\nthe same sort of thing. Thus there is a remainder\u2014a moral value\nthat is lost in the choice, and that it is rational to regret.\n\nBoth Martha Nussbaum (1986) and David Wiggins (1980) have argued for\npluralism on the grounds that only pluralism can explain akrasia, or\nweakness of will. An agent is said to suffer from weakness of will\nwhen she knowingly chooses a less good option over a better one. On\nthe face of it, this is a puzzling thing to do\u2014why would someone\nknowingly do what they know to be worse? A pluralist has a plausible\nanswer\u2014when the choice is between two different sorts of value,\nthe agent is preferring A to B, rather than preferring less of A to\nmore of A. Wiggins explains the akratic choice by suggesting that the\nagent is \u2018charmed\u2019 by some aspect of the choice, and is\nswayed by that to choose what she knows to be worse overall (Wiggins\n1980, p. 257). However, even Michael Stocker, the arch pluralist, does\nnot accept that this argument works. As Stocker points out, Wiggins is\nusing a distinction between a cognitive and an affective element to\nthe choice, and this distinction can explain akrasia on a monist\naccount of value too. Imagine that a monist hedonist agent is faced\nwith a choice between something that will give her more pleasure and\nsomething that will give her less pleasure. The cognitive aspect to\nthe choice is clear\u2014the agent knows that one option is more\npleasurable than the other, and hence on her theory better. However,\nto say that the agent believes that more pleasure is better is not to\nsay that she will always be attracted to the option that is most\npleasurable. She may, on occasion, be attracted to the option that is\nmore unusual or interesting. Hence she may act akratically because she\nwas charmed by some aspect of the less good choice\u2014and as\nStocker says, there is no need to posit plural values to make sense of\nthis\u2014being charmed is not the same as valuing. (Stocker 1990,\np.219).\n",
