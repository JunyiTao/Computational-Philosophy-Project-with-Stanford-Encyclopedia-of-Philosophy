    "main_text": "The Moral Status Framework\n6. The Moral Status Framework\n\n\nAccording to the Moral Status Framework (Streiffer 2005), what is\ndistinctively problematic about chimera research is the possibility\nthat the introduction of human material would enhance an animal\u2019s\nmoral status to the level of a normal human adult without respecting\nthe moral obligations entailed by that status. That is, such research\nmight cause an animal, which would have had a comparatively low moral\nstatus, to instead have the moral status of a normal human adult, and\nyet the animal might continue to be treated in ways typical of animal\nresearch subjects and which would be profoundly unethical given its\nnew moral status.\n\n\nLet us say that an individual\u2019s moral status is enhanced if it is\nraised from a (significantly) lower degree of moral status to the\nmoral status of a normal adult human. The Moral Status Framework\nraises two general questions about chimeric research. First, under\nwhat circumstances is it permissible to perform research in which an\nanimal\u2019s moral status is enhanced? (If animals already have the same\nmoral status as a normal human adult, then the Moral Status Framework\nbecomes otiose, except as a possible sociological explanation of why\nsome people who believe that animals normally have a significantly\nlower moral status than humans might object to some kinds of chimeric\nresearch.) Second, under what circumstances would the introduction of\nhuman material actually enhance an animal\u2019s moral status?\n\n\nThe moral permissibility of research in which an animal\u2019s moral status\nis enhanced can be evaluated both from the perspective of the research\nsubject and from the perspective of others. From the perspective of\nthe subject, there would seem to be the following main\npossibilities. First, an enhancement in moral status might always be\nan unequivocal good. Any deleterious effects an enhancement might have\non other factors that are relevant from the subject\u2019s perspective are\nalways outweighed by the enhancement itself. This can be labeled the\nMillian View, since it echoes Mill\u2019s remark that it is better to be\nSocrates unsatisfied than a pig satisfied. (If one links moral status\nto the Kantian good will, it also echoes Kant\u2019s remark that the good\nwill, \u201cregarded in itself, is to be valued incomparably higher\nthan all that could merely be brought about by it in favor of some\ninclination and indeed, if you will, of the sum of all\ninclination\u201d (Groundwork, AK 4: 394). \n\n\nSecond, there is the opposite of the Millian View, the No-Enhancing\nView, which holds that conferring an enhanced moral status on an\nindividual is always objectionable from the individual\u2019s\nperspective.\n\n\nIntermediate between these extreme views are various Instrumentalist\nViews, according to which the evaluation of an enhancement from the\nindividual\u2019s perspective depends (at least in large part) on how the\nindividual\u2019s life compares, in terms of other independently relevant\nfactors, to the life that it either would have had (the Instrumentalist\nView with the Non-Moral Baseline) or to the life to which it is\nentitled, given its enhanced moral status (the Instrumentalist View\nwith the Moral Baseline). The two Instrumentalist Views disagree on the\nevaluation of research in which an enhanced individual\u2019s life is better\nthan it would have been had its status not been enhanced, but given its\nnew moral status, it deserves to have its life be even better.\n\n\nBoth of the extreme views are implausible. Imagine conferring an\nenhanced moral status on an individual, and then ensuring that it\nlives a life in which it receives much better treatment than it would\nhave gotten otherwise and in which it is given everything it is owed\nin virtue of that enhanced moral status. It is hard to see how this\noutcome could be objectionable from the individual\u2019s perspective, as\nimplied by the No-Enhancing View. Nor does such research seem\nobjectionable from the perspective of others. It might be objected,\nfor example, that bringing new individuals into existence that have\nthe (previously) distinctive moral status of normal human adults\nsomehow lessens the value of that status for extant humans, as\nexpanding membership in an exclusive club might lessen its value to\nits already existing members. That objection, however, is belied by\nthe fact that every time people reproduce, they engage in just such an\nactivity, and they produce far more individuals with human moral\nstatus than would ever be produced by chimeric research. Another\nobjection might be that the extension of human moral status to\n\u201clesser animals\u201d somehow diminishes the value of that\nstatus for humans, as extending a university diploma to those who do\nnot deserve it lessens the value of that diploma for those who do. If,\nhowever, a transplant truly has enhanced the moral status of the\nchimeric research subject, then in whatever sense we humans\n\u201cdeserve\u201d our special status, it now does as well, and so\nthe value placed on human moral status will not be lessened.\n\n\nThe Millian View is also implausible: what kind of life an\nindividual with an enhanced status will lead surely matters. My life is\nbetter than the life of even a very satisfied pig, but if my\nlife were filled with enough pain and misery, and with extremely\nlimited prospects, it arguably would be worse. Indeed, the Millian view\nis even too extreme for Mill, who agrees that some people\u2019s lives are\nfilled with \u201cunhappiness so extreme\u201d that they would be better off\nexchanging \u201ctheir lot for almost any other, however undesirable in\ntheir own eyes\u201d (1979 [1861], 9).\n\n\nThis leaves the Instrumentalist Views. If one of the Instrumentalist\nViews is correct, then the question arises as to whether the moral\nbaseline or the non-moral baseline is relevant. To decide between these\ntwo options, consider an example from the literature on exploitation in\nwhich a transaction provides someone with a benefit, but with far less\nbenefit than they deserve: an employer who pays an employee a wage that\nis beneficial compared to the alternatives, but is still substantially\nless than what justice requires. In such cases, the relevant baseline\nfor the evaluation of the work is the moral baseline: given that the\nemployee deserves more, it is no defense of the employer\u2019s behavior to\nsay that the employee is better off than he would have been without the\njob (see Wertheimer (1996, 289\u2013291) for extended discussion of the\nanalogous case of an exploitative marriage). Similarly, the relevant\nquestion for evaluating status-enhancing research is surely whether the\nsubject\u2019s new entitlements are respected.\n\n\nBecause the relevant baseline is the moral baseline, research in which\na non-human animal\u2019s moral status is enhanced to that of a normal\nhuman adult raises the following problem. The view institutionalized\nby animal research oversight committees is that almost any valid\nresearch objective justifies sacrificing even the most fundamental\ninterests of non-human animals (Francione 1995). In contrast, the view\ninstitutionalized by human subjects research oversight committees is\nthat humans have a moral status which provides them with substantial\nmoral protections, including a very stringent prohibition on harmful\nresearch without informed consent. So long as experiments that involve\nthe transplantation of human stem cells into non-human animals are\noverseen by animal research oversight committees, or by human subjects\ncommittees attentive only to concerns of those who provided the\ngametes or embryos from which the stem cells were derived, the wrong\nset of moral protections is likely to be afforded to status-enhanced\nchimeric research subjects. If the relevant baseline were the\nnon-moral baseline, then transplants that enhanced moral status\nprobably would be no more problematic than other kinds of biomedical\nresearch on animals.  But because the relevant baseline is the moral\nbaseline, sacrificing the fundamental interests of the chimeric\nresearch subject as they would have been sacrificed in any other\nanimal research is the moral equivalent of sacrificing the fundamental\ninterests of a fully functional adult human being. In status-enhancing\nresearch, what would have been animal confinement, pain, suffering,\nand death, becomes the moral equivalent of\u2014and, on an\nanthropocentric view, also becomes\u2014human confinement, pain,\nsuffering, and death. On all but the most extreme animal rights views,\nthis makes status-enhancing chimeric research much worse than other\nbiomedical research on animals, and on any plausible view, makes it\nabsolutely unacceptable.\n\n\nAlternatively, if researchers adequately respected the chimeric\nresearch subject\u2019s newly enhanced status, then this objection would\nnot apply to the research. But respecting the subject\u2019s newly enhanced\nstatus would most likely frustrate the researcher\u2019s aims since most\nbiomedical research on non-human animals is done on non-humans\nprecisely because it involves procedures that plainly would be\nunethical if performed on individuals with the moral status of a\nnormal human adult. And even if the researchers were willing to try to\nrespect the subject\u2019s newly enhanced status, it is hard to imagine\nthat they could come close to succeeding: what kind of life are they\nproposing to provide for this individual they have created and who is\nnow under their care? Moreover, even if the research in question would\nbe compatible with the protections due to an individual with the moral\nstatus of a normal human adult, another objection would then apply, at\nleast when the research is intended to provide human-relevant\ninformation. Regular, non-chimeric humans will typically provide a\nbetter model in which to learn about human development and in which to\ntest possible therapies intended for human beings. Thus, it would be\nscientifically preferable to perform the research procedures on\nregular human beings rather than on chimeras. To insist on performing\nsuch research on enhanced human/non-human chimeras when they could\nethically be performed on human beings, then, would be scientifically\nunjustified and would arguably constitute unethical exploitation of\nthe chimera for the benefit of others.\n\n\nIf almost any status-enhancing research would be unethical, then it is\nimportant to know what kinds of transplants could enhance an animal\u2019s\nmoral status. Progress on this question can be made by asking why\nnormal adult humans possess their comparatively high moral status.  On\ncognitive capacity views of moral status, an individual\u2019s cognitive\ncapacities give them their moral status, and the high-level cognitive\ncapacities that normal human adults have is what gives them their\nrelatively high moral status (VanDeVeer 1979). Given that high-level\ncognitive capacities are intimately related to the individual\u2019s brain,\nthis view obviously justifies focusing on transplants that could\naffect the brain in a way that enhances cognitive capacities.\nHowever, there are many constraints on the ability of human stem cells\nto significantly enhance an animal\u2019s cognitive capacities. In some\ncases, the subject will be terminated before the development of the\nrelevant cognitive capacities, thus side-stepping the entire\nproblem. In many cases, cognitive enhancements would likely be\nprevented by the animal\u2019s smaller skull size and shorter gestation\nperiod, as well as by the surrounding non-human cellular environment\nthat would provide developmental cues to transplanted cells (Karpowicz\net al. 2005, 124\u2013126). In 2015, the National Institutes\nof Health hosted a workshop on research with animals containing human\ncells. Janet Rossant, chair of the workshop and a leading figure in\nchimera research, summarized several of presentations from current\nresearches as follows:\n\n\nThe state of the art today from all the contributors we heard was that\nyou can do these experiments, if you make the cells perhaps a bit more\nnaive then you can get cells into the blastocyst, but the\ncontributions that you see in post-implantation fetuses are very\nlow. They\u2019re not necessarily in all tissues, and the contributions are\nquite dispersed. So nobody showed us a very extensive contribution of\nhuman cells into an interspecies chimera (National Institutes of\nHealth 2015).\n\n\nFor the kinds of research currently underway, it seems highly\nimplausible that human cells could have significant effects on\ncognitive capacities. There are, however, a few caveats that should be\nnoted.\n\nFirst, following Rossant\u2019 summary, the scientists present had\nextensive discussion about strategies for improving the rates of\nchimerism. Considered purely as a scientific problem, there seems to\nbe significant interest in overcoming the current limitations which\nprevent human cells from having much of an impact. Moreover,\nexceptions to Rossant\u2019s generalization were mentioned later in the\nworkshop, including research in which human neural progenitor cells\nproliferated \u201cextensively\u201d when injected into the adult mouse brain,\nresearch in which some cell lineages continued to act like the\ndonor-species cell regardless of the surrounding animal environment,\nand research in which human-derived glial progenitor cells outcompeted\nthe corresponding mouse glial, \u201cultimately dominating the brain\u201d.\n Second, some researchers might be interested in designing experiments\nthat intentionally seek to overcome existing limitations on cognitive\ndevelopment in non-human animals. Some might want to do basic research\non the neurological development involved in language acquisition,\nmathematical concept acquisition, moral development, or any number of\nother cognitive capacities that are now limited to normally\nfunctioning human beings. Other researchers might be interested in creating chimeras\nin which the limitations on animal\u2019s cognition are overcome so that\nthey can be used as models to study diseases or injuries that impair\nhigh-level cognitive functions in humans. As noted by the NAS\nCommittee,\n\n\n\n[T]he idea that human neuronal cells might participate in\n\u201chigher-order\u201d brain functions in a nonhuman animal,\nhowever unlikely that may be, raises concerns that need to be\nconsidered. Indeed, if such cells are to be used in therapeutic\ninterventions, one needs to know whether they could participate in\nthat way in the context of a treatment. (NAS 2005, 33)\n\n\n\nStatus-enhancing research performed for such ends, were it ever to\nbecome more than science fiction, would be deemed impermissible by the\nMoral Status Framework.\n\n\nSecond, it is not yet clear what kinds of cognitive enhancements might\nbe possible even within a constrained environment. For example, it is\npossible to use genetic engineering to enhance the learning and memory\nof mice without modifying skull size or gestational period (Tang et\nal. 1999). Further, the incorporation of human glia and astrocytes\ninto the brains of neonatal mice was found to \u201csharply enhance\u201d their\nlearning (Han et al. 2013, Cossins 2013, Cole 2013). More extremely,\nif large quantities of hESCs are introduced during the early stages of\nembryonic development, it is possible that the cells themselves could\ninduce changes that would eliminate some of the constraints mentioned\nabove. Although some of the experiments cited above do involve the\nintroduction of hES and neural progenitor cells early in development,\nexperience in this area is limited. As the NAS Committee\nconcluded,\n\n\n\nThis approach [the introduction of human ES cells into a non-human\nblastocyst] is an obvious extension of techniques widely used in\nresearch with [mouse ES] cells\u2014namely, aggregation of\nmorulas from two mice or injection of mES cells into mouse blastocysts.\nIn both cases, the cells can contribute extensively to any mouse that\narises from implantation of such a chimeric blastocyst. Clearly, an\nanimal (e.g., mouse) blastocyst into which human cells are transplanted\nraises other issues because potentially the inner cell mass, the\nprogenitor of the fetus, would consist of a mixture of human and mouse\ncells. It is not now possible to predict the extent of human\ncontribution to such chimeras. (NAS 2005, 34; for further discussion\nsee Streiffer (2005, 355\u2013357, 363\u2013364).)\n\n\n\nIt therefore seems premature to place much confidence in our ability\nto draw a precise line between transplants during the embryonic stages\nof development that will, and those that will not, enhance an animal\u2019s\ncognitive capacities. Moreover, even among those who favor a\ncognitive-capacities view of moral status, it is contentious just what\nlevel of cognitive capacities is needed to attain full moral\nstatus.\n\n\nOn anthropocentric views of moral status, normal human adults have\nthe moral status they do simply because they are human beings, that is,\nbecause they are members of the species Homo sapiens (Noonan\n1970; Devine 1978; Schwarz 1990). As has often been noted,\nanthropocentric views seem to suffer from an explanatory gap: it is\nhard to see how being a member of a certain species could give an\nindividual its moral status (Regan 1978; Feinberg 1980; DeGrazia 1996,\n56\u201361). Nonetheless proponents of these views argue\nthat they provide the only way to adequately explain the equal moral\nstatus of all human beings, even human beings who lack high-level\ncognitive capacities, and thereby to avoid the so-called \u201cmarginal\ncases\u201d that afflict cognitive capacity views.\n\n\nAnthropocentric views raise difficult questions about how much human\nmaterial an individual needs in order to be a human being. Since normal\nhuman embryos are both human and organisms, they are human beings,\nalbeit ones at the earliest stages of development (Feinberg 1980,\n288\u2013291). But when faced with an organism that has\nsome human cells and some non-human cells, how is one to decide whether\nthe organism is human, and hence, whether it is a human being? It is\noverly narrow to focus on transplants that affect neural tissue, since\nit is not plausible to suppose that an individual must have a human\nbrain to be a human being: an anencephalic infant is a human being and\nwould possess human moral status on an anthropocentric view.\nPresumably, replacing the entire inner cell mass of an animal\nblastocyst with hESCs would suffice to make the resulting\nindividual a human being since, in normal human development, the inner\ncell mass is what goes on to form the fetus. In such cases, one could,\nat least in principle, end up with a human being surrounded by a\nnon-human trophectoderm (the layer of cells surrounding the embryo\nwhich goes on to form the placental structures). If an anthropocentric\nview of moral status is correct then the Moral Status Framework would\nclearly condemn such research. On the other hand, having only a few\nnon-human cells in the final individual would not suffice since a human\nwith a porcine heart valve is still a human being. But where to draw\nthe line is unclear, similar to the situation with objects that have\nvague identity conditions (Parfit 1984, 231\u2013243;\nThomson 1987; Thomson 1997; Piotrowska 2014).\n\n\nIn sum, then, although the Moral Status Framework appears to provide\na sound objection to status-enhancing research, its application is\nnonetheless hampered by the empirical uncertainties regarding the\neffects that various kinds of hESC transplants would have and the moral\nuncertainties regarding which effects would be status-enhancing.\n",
