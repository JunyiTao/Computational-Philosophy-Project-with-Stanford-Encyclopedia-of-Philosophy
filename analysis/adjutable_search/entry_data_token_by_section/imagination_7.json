    "main_text": "Imagination in Cognitive Architecture || Imagination, Imagery, and Perception\n2.3 Imagination, Imagery, and Perception\n\nTo have a (merely) mental image is to have a perception-like\nexperience triggered by something other than the appropriate external\nstimulus; so, for example, one might have \u201ca picture in the\nmind\u2019s eye or \u2026 a tune running through one\u2019s\nhead\u201d (Strawson 1970: 31) in the absence of any corresponding\nvisual or auditory object or event (see the entry on\n mental imagery).\n While it is propositional imagination that gets compared to\nbelief and desire, it is sensory or imagistic\nimagination that get compared to perception (Currie & Ravenscroft\n2002). Although it is possible to form mental images in any of the\nsensory modalities, the bulk of discussion in both philosophical and\npsychological contexts has focused on visual imagery.\n\nBroadly, there is agreement on the similarity between mental imagery\nand perception in phenomenology, which can be explicated as a\nsimilarity in content (Nanay 2016b; see, for example, Kind 2001; Nanay\n2015; Noordhof 2002). Potential candidates for distinguishing mental\nimagery and perception include intensity (Hume\u2019s Treatise of\nHuman Nature; but see Kind 2017), voluntariness (McGinn 2004;\nIchikawa 2009), causal relationship with the relevant object (Noordhof\n2002); however, no consensus exists on features that clearly\ndistinguish the two, in part because of ongoing debates about\nperception (see the entries on\n contents of perception\n and\n epistemological problems of perception).\n\nWhat is the relationship between imaginings and mental imagery?\n\nHistorically, mental imagery is thought to be an essential component\nof imaginings. Aristotle\u2019s phantasia, which is\nsometimes translated as imagination, is a faculty that produces images\n(De Anima; see entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s conception of imagination;\n but see Caston 1996). Ren\u00e9 Descartes (Meditations on First\nPhilosophy) and David Hume (Treatise of Human Nature)\nboth thought that to imagine just is to hold a mental image, or an\nimpression of perception, in one\u2019s mind. However, George\nBerkeley\u2019s puzzle of visualizing the unseen (Three Dialogues\nbetween Hylas and Philonous) arguably suggests the existence of a\nnon-imagistic hypothetical attitude.\n\nAgainst the historical orthodoxy, the contemporary tendency is to\nrecognize that there is at least one species of\nimagination\u2014propositional imagination\u2014that does not\nrequire mental imagery. For example, Kendall Walton simply states,\n\u201cimagining can occur without imagery\u201d (1990: 13). In turn, against\nthis contemporary tendency, Amy Kind (2001) argues that an image-based account can\nexplain three crucial features of imagination\u2014directedness,\nactive nature, and phenomenological character\u2014better than its\nimageless counterpart. As a partial reconciliation of the two, Peter Langland-Hassan (2015) develops\na pluralist position on which there exists a variety of imaginative\nattitudes, including ones that can take on hybrid contents that are\npartly propositional and partly sensorily imagistic. (For a nuanced\noverview of this debate, see Gregory 2016: 103\u2013106.)\n\nFinally, the relationship between mental imagery and perception has\npotential implications for the connection between imagination and\naction. The orthodoxy on propositional belief-like imagination holds\nthat imagination does not directly output to action-generation system;\nrather, the connection between the two is mediated by belief and\ndesire. In contrast, the enactivist program in the philosophy of\nperception holds that perception can directly output to\naction-generation system (see, for example, Nanay 2013). Working from\nthe starting point that imagistic imagination is similar to perception\nin its inclusion of mental imagery, some philosophers have argued for\na similar direct connection between imagistic imagination and\naction-generation system (Langland-Hassan 2015; Nanay 2016a; Van\nLeeuwen 2011, 2016b). That is, there exist imagery-oriented actions\nthat are analogous to perception-oriented actions. For example, Neil\nVan Leeuwen (2011) argues that an account of imagination that is\nimagistically-rich can better explain pretense behaviors than its\npropositional-imagination-only rivals. Furthermore, Robert Eamon Briscoe (2008, 2018) argues that representations that blend inputs from perception and mental imagery, which he calls \u201cmake-perceive\u201d, guide many everyday actions. For example, a sculptor might use a blend of the visual perception of a stone and the mental imagery of different parts of the stone being subtracted to guide their physical manipulation of the stone.\n",
