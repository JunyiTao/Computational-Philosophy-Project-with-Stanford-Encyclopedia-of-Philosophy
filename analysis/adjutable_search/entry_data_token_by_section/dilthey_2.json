The human sciences\n(Geisteswissenschaften) encompass both the humanities and the\nsocial sciences. They range from disciplines like philology, literary\nand cultural studies, religion and psychology, to political science\nand economics. Dilthey insists that the human sciences be related not\nby some logical construct on the order of August Comte or J.S. Mill,\nbut by means of reflective considerations that take their historical\ngenesis into account. Dilthey writes that \n\n\nthe human sciences as they exist and as they are practiced according\nto the reason of things that were active in their history \u2026\ncontain three classes of assertions. (1883/SW.I, 78) \n\n\nThese are 1) descriptive and historical statements, 2) theoretical\ngeneralizations about partial contents and 3) evaluative judgments and\npractical rules. The human sciences are more obviously normative in\nnature than the natural sciences for which formal norms related to\nobjective inquiry suffice. The fact that the human sciences are forced\nto confront substantive normative issues puts a limit on the kind of\ntheoretical regularities that can be established in the human\nsciences. Given the core role that human beings play in the\nsocio-historical world, the understanding of individuality is as\nimportant in the human sciences as are the explanations to be found\nthrough generalizations.\n\nBut the human science of psychology that deals with individual human\nbeings cannot examine them apart from interactions with society.\n\u201cMan as a fact prior to history and society is a fiction\u201d\n(1883/SW.I, 83). This means that psychology can be a foundational\nhuman science only if it is conceived as being primarily descriptive.\nPsychological explanations may still be possible, but only by starting\nwith a non-hypothetical base that describes how our experience\nassimilates social and cultural features. Many human character traits\nare not purely psychological. Thus when we speak of a person as\nthrifty we are combining economic and psychological features.\n\nIndividual human beings are important for the understanding of\nhistory, but instead of making them the monadic building blocks of\nhistory, they are to be considered as points of intersection of many\nforces. Only a multidisciplinary approach to human history can do it\njustice. Qua conscious living beings, individuals are the\ncarriers of history, but they are just as much the products of\nhistory. Individuals are not self-sufficient atoms. But neither are\nthey to be regarded as swallowed up by encompassing communities like\nnations or peoples. Concepts that posit the soul of a people\n\u201care no more usable in history than is the concept of life-force\nin physiology\u201d (1883/SW.I, 92). Suspicion of those who posit\noverriding self-sufficient entities like nations and peoples led\nDilthey to distance himself from the nationalism of his contemporary\nHeinrich von Treitschke and to ally himself with a political reformism\nreminiscent of Kant and Wilhelm von Humboldt.\n\nDilthey conceives of most of the human sciences as analyzing human\ninteractions at a level that can mediate between individual initiative\nand communal tradition. These sciences deal with what he calls\n\u201ccultural systems\u201d and \u201cexternal organizations of\nsociety\u201d. Cultural systems are associations that individuals\njoin voluntarily for certain purposes that they can only achieve\nthrough cooperation. These systems are cultural in the widest possible\nsense and include all aspects of our social life. They can be\npolitical, economic, artistic, scientific or religious in nature and\nare not normally bound by national or other overarching interests.\nExternal organizations of society by contrast are those more\ncontrolling institutional structures like a family and a state that we\nare born into. Here \u201cenduring causes bind the wills of many into\na single whole\u201d (1883/SW.I, 94) within which relations of power,\ndependence and property can be established. It is important to\ncross-reference cultural systems and institutional organizations.\nEnlightenment thinkers had focused on cultural systems such as\nscientific academies and their potential universal scope while\noverlooking how most educational institutions are controlled by local\nauthorities. Although Dilthey received his training from members of\nthe Historical School, he recognized that many of them had been\nequally one-sided by stressing the distinctive institutional\norganizations that separate different peoples while ignoring the role\nof generalizations made possible through the analysis of cultural\nsystems.\n\nDilthey aims to combine these two approaches to liberalize the\nhistoricist perspective and give it a methodological rigor. To\nunderstand the role of the law in historical life we must consider it\nboth as a cultural system that frames legal issues in universal terms\nand as an external organization of society that examines them in terms\nof the positive laws of particular institutions. The Historical School\nwas wrong to regard individuals as completely subordinate to the bonds\nof family and state and to think that the positive laws of\ninstitutions define the full reality of life. The authority of the\nstate \u201cencompasses only a certain portion \u2026 of the\ncollective power of the populace\u201d and even when state power\nexerts a certain preponderance it can do so only \u201cthrough the\ncooperation of psychological impulses\u201d (1883/SW.I, 132).\n\nIn the preface to the Introduction to the Human Sciences,\nDilthey refers to his project as a Critique of Historical Reason. We\ncan now see that this is first of all a critique of the metaphysical\nthesis that there can be an overarching \u201cuniversal explanatory\nframework for all historical facts\u201d (1883/SW.I, 141). If\nuniversal explanations are to be possible for history as well as for\nnature, then we must recognize that they are only possible for\ncorrelating partial contents of reality. The reason that the natural\nsciences have been so successful in discovering causal laws of nature\nis that they abstract from the full scope of the external world. \n\n\nThe conditions sought by the mechanistic explanation\nof nature explain only part of the contents of external\nreality. This intelligible world of atoms, ether, vibrations, is\nonly a calculated and highly artificial abstraction from what is given\nin outer and lived experience. (1883/SW.I, 203) \n\n\nThe human sciences cannot similarly construct an abstract phenomenal\nworld that focuses on physical and chemical processes and appeals to\nhypothetical atomic or even subatomic elements. It is incumbent on the\nhuman sciences to deal with the more complex networks of the\nhistorical world and the actual givens of human beings. Explanations\nthat are adequate for the historical world will require an analysis of\nthe multiple partial contents that are relevant in a particular\ncontext. According to Dilthey the human sciences must replace the\nabstract methodology of the natural sciences with an analytic\ncounterpart. \n\n\nAbstraction is distinguished from analysis in that the former singles\nout one fact and disregards the others, whereas the latter\nseeks to apprehend the majority of the facts that make up the factors\nof a complex whole. (ca. 1880\u20131893/SW.I, 433) \n\n\nThe more facts that explanations seek to correlate, the more limited\ntheir scope must be. Thus the laws to be discovered in the human\nsciences will apply not to history in general, but only to specific\ncultural systems or institutional organizations. It may be possible to\narrive at causal laws of economic growth, of scientific progress or of\nliterary development, but not at overarching historical laws of human\nprogress.\n\nSo far Dilthey has argued for a relative independence of the human\nsciences vis-\u00e0-vis the better established natural\nsciences. However, from the transcendental perspective that considers\nthe conditions our consciousness brings to experience, the human\nsciences must claim a reflective priority. The realization that the\nhuman sciences not only ascertain what is\u2014as do the natural\nsciences\u2014but also make value judgments, establish goals and\nprescribe rules, discloses that they are much more directly related to\nthe full reality of lived experience. The Kantian I-think that is the\nbasis of the conceptual cognition (Erkenntnis) of the natural\nsciences really derives from a direct knowing (Wissen) rooted\nin Dilthey\u2019s more inclusive thinking-feeling-willing of lived\nexperience (see 1883/SW.I, 228, and ca. 1880\u201393/SW.I,\n263\u201368). The natural sciences merely construct a phenomenal or\nideal world that abstracts from the real nexus of lived experience.\nThe world that is formed by the human sciences is the\nhistorical-social reality in which human beings participate. It is a\nreal world that is directly possessed or present in what Dilthey calls\nInnewerden. This term has sometimes been translated as\n\u201cinner awareness,\u201d but is is better to translate it as\n\u201creflexive awareness\u201d to indicate how things are\nthere-for-us. Reflexive awareness is a pre-reflective, indexical mode\nof consciousness that \u201cdoes not place a content over against the\nsubject of consciousness (it does not re-present it)\u201d (ca.\n1880\u201393/SW.I, 253). It is the direct know-how that reality is\npresent-for-me prior to any of the reflective act-content,\ninner-outer, or subject-object distinctions that characterize the\nrepresentational world of conceptual cognition.\n\nThe human sciences must hold on to the original presence of this\ndirectly known reality even as they proceed to use the intellectual\ntools of conceptual cognition in their analysis of partial contents.\nThe way the historical world is represented and analyzed must in some\nway still reflect the way history has been lived. The final\nunderstanding (Verstehen) aimed at by Dilthey\u2019s human\nsciences must draw on all our capacities and is to be distinguished\nfrom the mere intellectual and abstract understanding\n(Verstand) of Kant\u2019s natural sciences. \n\nIn attempting to convey the richness and depth of lived experience,\nthe human sciences must also consider the contribution of the arts.\nAesthetics constitutes an important cultural system in that it can\nprovide a sense of how the arts can contribute to human understanding\nin general. Dilthey\u2019s Poetics of 1887 represents an\neffort to develop certain psychological concepts to explicate the\nworkings of the poetic imagination. Even in ordinary life, the images\nwe extract from experience are subject to metamorphosis. With time all\nour images are transformed, for \u201cthe same image can no more\nreturn than the same leaf can grow back on a tree the following\nspring\u201d (1887/SW.V, 102). The first law of metamorphosis\ninvolves the exclusion of those constituents of images that are not\nvaluable to us. Not every apprehended constituent is worth\nremembering. According to Dilthey we do not just passively absorb\nevery impression that comes our way. We filter out what is not worth\nperceiving by a process of apperception. This apperception is guided\nby what is called an \u201cacquired nexus of psychic life\u201d.\nBecause this gradually acquired nexus differs for each subject, the\nprocess of exclusion never has the same outcome.\n\nSome of what has not been excluded by the first law of imaginative\nmetamorphosis can then become the focus of special attention.\nAccording to Dilthey\u2019s second law of imaginative metamorphosis\n\u201cImages are transformed when they expand or contract, when the\nintensity of the sensations of which they are composed is increased or\ndecreased\u201d (1887/SW.V, 102). Such a change in intensity can\napply to either the reproductive imagination of ordinary memory or the\nproductive imagination of poets or novelists. In the former case of\nmemory an increase of intensity tends to be as much a function of a\npresent practical interest as of acquired experience. In the latter\ncase of the imagination of poets an increase of intensity is more\nlikely to be primarily regulated by their overall acquired psychic\nnexus. What distinguishes the imagination of great poets according to\nDilthey is their capacity to ignore the constant distractions and\nmundane interests of daily life. Only they can unfold imagery in a way\nthat reflects our overall human values.\n\nThe third law of imaginative metamorphosis involves their completion,\nby which Dilthey means a process \u201cby which something outer is\nenlivened by something inner or something inner is made visible and\nintuitable by something outer\u201d (1887/SW.V, 104). In completion\nthere is an interpenetration between inner feeling and outer\nperception so that the very nucleus of an image can symbolize the\noverall acquired psychic nexus. Dilthey writes, \n\n\nOnly when the whole acquired psychic nexus becomes active can\nimages be transformed on the basis of it: innumerable,\nimmeasurable, almost imperceptible changes occur in their\nnucleus. And in this way, the completion of the particular originates\nfrom the fullness of psychic life. (1887/SW.V, 104)\n\n\nThis last law of imaginative completion applies only to artists and\nallows them to articulate the essential meaning of\nlife-situations\u2014through them we come to see what is typical in\nlife. These laws of metamorphosis are conceived as explanative to the\nextent that they appeal to an overall acquired psychic nexus as their\nultimate context. But a more comprehensive descriptive account shows\nthese laws to be rather schematic and unable to capture all the\nqualitative changes that result for our understanding of the world\nmore generally. And for that reason Dilthey backs away from pure\npsychological explanations after 1887. In the essay \u201cThree\nEpochs of Modern Aesthetics\u201d of 1892 he redescribes imaginative\nmetamorphosis more structurally. A portrait painter is said to order\nthe structure of what is objectively perceived \n\n\naround one especially noticeable point, which I will call the\naesthetic point of impression. Every carefully observed face is\nunderstood on the basis of such a dominant impression \u2026. On the\nbasis of this impression and repeated memory, indifferent features are\nexcluded, while telling features are stressed and refractory ones\nde-emphasized. The remaining whole is unified ever more decisively.\n(1892/SW.V, 217) \n\n\nNow exclusion, intensification and unifying completion are understood\nas part of a process of articulating the structure of our experience\nof reality.\n",
