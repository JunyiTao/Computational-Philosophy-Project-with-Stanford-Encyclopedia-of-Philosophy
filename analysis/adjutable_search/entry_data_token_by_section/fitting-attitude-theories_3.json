    "main_text": "Clarifying FA Theories: Some Choice Points || Fitting for Whom?\n1.4 Fitting for Whom?\n\nFA theories explain evaluative properties in terms of normative facts\nabout responses that are somehow called for by things that have those\nproperties. But who is to have the responses in question?\nThis is undertheorized, but the answer seems to be: it depends. In\nparticular, the answer seems to depend on the nature of the evaluative\nproperty that an FA theory seeks to explain. If the evaluative\nproperty is \u201cagent-neutral\u201d, then everyone, or just\nanyone, is to have the response in terms of which FA theories aim to\nexplain the relevant property; if the property is\n\u201cagent-relative\u201d, then at least someone, but not just\nanyone, is to have the response. Whether an evaluative property is\nneutral or relative can be a matter of debate, but consider\nawesomeness as a plausible example of the former and\nshamefulness as an example of the latter. The awesome calls\nfor everyone, or just anyone, to be in awe of it, but the same\nisn\u2019t so for shamefulness: not just anyone is to be ashamed of a\nshameful act; instead, a shameful act calls for shame only on the part\nof the person who performed it (or perhaps also on the part of those\nwho are somehow closely\n related).[1]\n\nA further, related question is whether the normative property of\nresponses that FA theories appeal to is (or should be)\nobjective, such that all facts are in principle relevant to\nwhether it obtains, or perspectival, such that only\nepistemically accessible or possessed facts are relevant. Here, too,\nit seems the FA theorist should say that it depends on the nature of\nthe evaluative property that an FA theory aims to explain. For\ninstance, facts about whether someone is blameworthy\ndon\u2019t seem to depend on anyone\u2019s epistemic position, so\nsomeone could be blameworthy without anyone knowing it. FA theorists\nshould therefore say that such facts are to be explained by appeal to\nan objective normative property of responses, i.e., a property the\nobtaining of which can be affected by facts unknown to the subject. In\ncontrast, since facts about the curiousness of a question or\nthe credibility of a proposition can seem to depend on a\nsubject\u2019s perspective, FA theorists should say that such facts\nare to be explained by appeal to a normative property that\u2019s\nsimilarly perspective dependent (Way 2020)\u2014for example,\nsubjective reasons (Fogal and Worsnip 2021) or perhaps\nwarrant (D\u2019Arms and Jacobson 2000a). This is a further\nway in which an evaluative property might be agent-relative, as\nopposed to agent-neutral: if it\u2019s perspectival, as opposed to\nobjective. To be clear: this doesn\u2019t mean that FA theories are\nnecessarily disunified, appealing to different normative properties\ndepending on their explanandum. Instead, FA theorists can seek to\nexplain whatever objective normative property they appeal to in terms\nof its perspectival counterpart or vice versa, and claim that\nevaluative properties can ultimately be explained by appeal to\nwhichever of these is more fundamental. For example, an FA theorist\nmight appeal to both objective and subjective reasons to explain the\nfull range of evaluative properties they aim to explain, but then\nexplain subjective reasons in terms of objective ones, and thus\nultimately appeal only to normative facts of a single kind in\nexplaining the evaluative facts.\n",
