    "main_text": "Traditional Arguments (B) Con (with Epiphenomenalists\u2019 Responses) || Natural Selection\n2.2 Natural Selection\n\nThe development of consciousness must be explainable through natural\nselection. But a property can be selected for only if it has an effect\nupon organisms\u2019 behavior. Therefore, consciousness (both qualia\nand intentional states) must have effects in behavior, i.e.,\nepiphenomenalism is false. (See Popper and Eccles 1977; James 1879;\nRomanes 1896; Klein 2019.)\n\nAccording to the same biology that embraces natural selection,\nhowever, behavior has muscular causes, which in turn have neural\ncauses. Barring neural events that are inexplicably in violation of\nbiological constraints on their conditions of activation, there must\nbe an adequate physical cause of every link in the causal chain\nleading to behavior. Thus, it is easily understood how certain kinds\nof neural events can be selected for. Epiphenomenalists hold that\nconscious events are effects of (certain) neural events. Thus, it fits\nwell in their view that we have the conscious events we do because the\nneural causes of these events have been selected for. Indeed, if\nneural causes of behavior are selected for, and are sufficient causes,\nthere cannot be any further effect attributed to\nnatural selection.\n\nWilliam James (1879; 1890; see also Bradley, 2011) offered an\nintriguing variant of the argument from natural selection. If pleasure\nand displeasure have no effects, there would seem to be no reason why\nwe might not abhor the feelings that are caused by activities\nessential to life, or enjoy the feelings produced by what is\ndetrimental. Thus, if epiphenomenalism (or, in James\u2019s own\nlanguage, automaton-theory) were true, the felicitous alignment that\ngenerally holds between affective valuation of our feelings and the\nutility of the activities that generally produce them would require a\nspecial explanation. Yet on epiphenomenalist assumptions, this\nalignment could not receive a genuine explanation. The felicitous\nalignment could not be selected for, because if affective valuation\nhad no behavioral effects, misalignment of affective valuation with\nutility of the causes of the evaluated feelings could not have any\nbehavioral effects either. Epiphenomenalists would simply have to\naccept a brute and unscientific view of pre-established harmony of\naffective valuation of feelings and the utility of their causes.\n\nEpiphenomenalists can respond to James\u2019s argument by offering\nsupport for the following two views. (I) There is a distinction\nbetween (a) neural events in sensory systems, which cause feelings,\nand (b) neural events in a reward system (where an event is a member\nof a reward system if and only if it contributes to continuance (or,\ndiscontinuance) or repetition (or avoidance) in similar circumstances,\nof any behavior that leads to that event). (II) What\n\u201cpleasure\u201d refers to in any possible world is the effect\nin consciousness of the events in (b) that contribute to continuance\nor repetition. Since both (a) events and (b) events have neural and,\nultimately, behavioral effects, they can be selected for, and so can\ntheir combination. The alignment of feelings caused by useful stimuli\nand pleasure (and, by parallel reasoning, alignment of feelings caused\nby harmful stimuli and displeasure) would then follow from alignment\nof neural events of the kinds described in (a) and (b). This latter\nalignment is independently plausible. A reward system that can lead to\nquick decisions and a sensory system that provides discriminations for\nuse in longer term planning would both confer advantages; and these\nsystems would, in general, have to work together in a successful\norganism. (For fuller discussion of James\u2019s argument see\nRobinson 2007, 2019; and for the structure of pleasure, see Robinson\n2006b, 2019.)\n",
