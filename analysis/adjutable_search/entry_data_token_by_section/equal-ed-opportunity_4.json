The Meaning of and Debates about Equality of Educational Opportunity\n\nDebates about the meaning and value of equality of educational\nopportunity\u2014and about whether equal educational opportunity\nrequires equality or adequacy\u2014can be considered in the light of\ntwo questions.\n\nThe first question is that given the diverse goals of\neducation\u2014preparing individuals for the job market, for\ndemocratic citizenship, and to experience the intrinsic goods of\neducation\u2014is there only one justified rubric for distributing\neducational resources? For instance, distributional policies that\nsupport career preparation may be very different from those that\nsupport other goals like preparation for democratic citizenship. Since\nthe labor market is a highly competitive sphere, education for labor\nmarket success appears to be a positional good, understood as a good\nwhose value depends on one\u2019s relative standing (i.e., the\nquality of my education for labor market success depends to a great\nextent on how good your education in this realm is since we will be\nvying for jobs). In a highly competitive job market with high stakes,\ndistributing educational resources equally becomes especially\nimportant.\n\nConversely, education for human flourishing can be seen as a\nnon-positional good because an individual\u2019s attainment of the\nintrinsic goods of education (e.g., to enjoy literature, to be\nintellectually curious) is not compromised by others\u2019 success in\nthis realm; it is not a competitive field. In fact, one\u2019s\nability to enjoy the arts might be increased by others\u2019 ability\nto do so too. An adequacy threshold for distributing educational\nopportunities directed at human flourishing may therefore be\njustified. As our educational goals vary, so too might the\ndistributive principles for educational resources need to change.\n\nThe second question we must consider is about the best interpretation\nof the ideal of equality of educational opportunity. Is equality of\nopportunity achieved when everyone with similar talent gets the same\nresults? When per pupil expenditures are equalized? When those with\nthe same natural talent potential get the same opportunities?\n\nAnswers to these two fundamental questions enable philosophers to\nconstruct a conception of equality of educational opportunity. Of\ncourse, philosophical controversies remain even supposing the content\nof the conception can be settled. Some of these controversies concern\nclashes with other values, including that of the family and diversity:\nWhat limits do parental rights put on the pursuit of equality of\neducational opportunity? Is affirmative action required by or contrary\nto equality of educational opportunity? Other issues arise when we try\nto interpret what equality of educational opportunity means for those\nwith disabilities, or when we attempt to define \u201cmerit\u201d\nand \u201cnative talent potential\u201d.\n\nThe following sections of this entry will describe the key maneuvers\nin different ways of answering these two questions: first, what the\nideal can mean and what distributive principles realize it; and\nsecond, how to navigate tensions between this ideal and other values.\nThe first section below introduces debates about the various\ndefinitions of equality of educational opportunity and its associated\ndistributive principles. Some of the material covered in this section\ncomes from the literature on equality of opportunity more generally,\nwhich we apply to educational aspects of these debates (for a recent\narticle in this spirit written for the education policy and research\ncommunity, see Levinson, Geron, and Brighouse, 2022). The subsequent\nsection surveys debates about how to negotiate the challenges faced by\nthose looking to realize the ideal of equality of educational\nopportunity, including whether equality of educational opportunity can\nbe reconciled with respecting the private sphere of the family.\n",
