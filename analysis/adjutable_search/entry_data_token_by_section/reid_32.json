    "main_text": "Philosophy of Religion || Arguments for God's Existence\n8.4 The Problem of Evil\n\n\nAs a parish minister, a philosopher, and someone with extensive\ntheological training\u2014as well as a father who had only one of six\nchildren survive him\u2014Reid no doubt reflected long and hard about\npain and suffering, and their relationship to God. But Reid writes\nlittle about the problem of evil. In Natural Theology, in\nwhat is labeled \u201cLect. 84th\u201d, he treats the subject\ndirectly and in less than two thousand words.\n\n\nNotes to Reid's lectures distinguish between three forms of evil:\n\u201c1. the evils of imperfection, 2. Evil which they call natural\nEvil, 3. Moral evil\u201d (Natural Theology\n101). The first refers to the fact that creatures could have been\ngiven greater degrees of perfection. The second form is\n\u201csuffering & pain which we see endured by beings in the\nUniverse.\u201d The third refers to the \u201cviolation of the laws\nof Virtue by moral & reasonable agents\u201d (Natural\nTheology 101).\n\n \nThe traditional problem of evil focuses on the second definition of\n\u2018evil\u2019. To this Reid offers a soul-making theodicy, and couples it\nwith an emphasis on human epistemic limits. First, \u201cit is by\nnatural evil that men are trained unto wisdom & prudence in their\nconduct.\u201d Then he adds that \u201cwe are not competent judges\n& cannot possibly determine\u201d whether these virtues could\nhave been achieved in humankind without the natural evil (and the\ndegree of natural evil) we witness in our world (Natural\nTheology 101). The addition of this second epistemic component\ngives rise to an internal tension. Reid juxtaposes this affirmation of\nignorance with substantive epistemic claims, for example, that\n\u201cfrom the present constitution of things we see they [natural\nevils] are necessary to our acquiring any prudence or wisdom...\u201d\n(Natural Theology 101\u2013102). Reid presents these comments as\nanswering the problem, but the Baird notes do not Reid's caveats or\nReid's attempt to justify the necessities to which he refers.\n\n \nThe cornerstone of Reid's reply to the third form of evil\u2014moral\nevil\u2014is human freedom. Lectures on Natural Theology\ndoes not revisit his theory of human freedom and agency, but these\nissues are discussed thoroughly in Active Powers. He applies\nthis theory of freedom to moral evil in order to conclude that\n\u201call moral evil then is not properly the doing of God but of\nmen, who by abusing their power are liable to misery & are then\njustly punished for their misconduct\u201d (Natural Theology\n103).\n\n \nTo conclude, Reid's two substantive contributions to the subsequent\ndevelopment of philosophy of religion are indirect. First, regarding\nGod's existence, Reid changes the field of play from metaphysics and\nproofs to epistemology and rationality. Second, Reid's development of\nan agent-causal account of freedom offered a foundation for responding\nto the problem of moral evil.\n",
