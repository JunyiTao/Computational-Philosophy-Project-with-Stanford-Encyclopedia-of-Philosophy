Life and Works\n1.1 Life\n\n\nAl-Kindi was a member of the Arab tribe of Kinda, which had played an\nimportant role in the early history of Islam. His lineage earned him\nthe title \u201cphilosopher of the Arabs\u201d among later writers.\nWe know that al-Kindi died after 866 CE, and his death date is usually\nput in the early 870s. His birth date is harder to pin down, but he\nis said to have served as a scholar under the caliph al-Ma\u2019mun,\nwhose reign ended in 833, and he was certainly associated with the\ncourt of the next caliph, al-Mu\u2018tasim (reigned\n833\u2013842). He is thus usually reckoned to have been born around\n800 CE. He was born in Basra and educated in Baghdad. His\nphilosophical career peaked under al-Mu\u2018tasim, to whom al-Kindi\ndedicated his most famous work, On First Philosophy, and\nwhose son Ahmad was tutored by al-Kindi.\n\n\nAl-Kindi\u2019s philosophical activities centered around the\ntranslation movement that had been initiated and supported by the\n\u2018Abbasid caliphs since prior to al-Kindi\u2019s birth (on this\nsee Endress 1987/1992, Gutas 1998). Al-Kindi oversaw one of the two\nmain groups of translators in the ninth century (the other group was\nled by Hunayn ibn Ishaq). The \u201cKindi circle\u201d (see Endress\n1997) translated numerous works of philosophy and science from Greek\ninto Arabic. (On the output of the circle see below, 2.1.) Al-Kindi\nseems to have been a mediator between the patrons of these translators\nand the scholars who actually did the translating, many of whom were\nSyrian Christians or of Syrian extraction. His own writings might be\nthought of as a sustained public relations campaign intended to display\nand advertise the value of Greek thought for a contemporary ninth\ncentury Muslim audience.\n1.2 Works\n\n\nWe are fortunate in having a list of titles of works ascribed to\nal-Kindi, which is found in the Fihrist of the tenth century\nbookseller Ibn al-Nadim. Thanks to Ibn al-Nadim we know that al-Kindi\nwrote hundreds of treatises on a very wide variety of scientific and\nphilosophical disciplines. Indeed the scientific and mathematical\ntitles far outnumber the philosophical titles. Many of the latter would\nnow be lost if not for a single manuscript, held in Istanbul, which\ncontains most of al-Kindi\u2019s extant philosophical writings (edited\nin Abu Rida 1950 and 1953; several important texts are edited and\ntranslated in Rashed and Jolivet 1998). This includes the work for\nwhich he is best known, On First Philosophy. Our version of\nthis treatise is incomplete, comprising only the first part, which is\ndivided into four sections. The first section is essentially an\nexhortation to the reader to honor Greek philosophical wisdom. The\nsecond contains al-Kindi\u2019s celebrated discussion of the eternity\nof the world. The third and fourth establish the existence of a\n\u201ctrue One,\u201d i.e. God, which is the source of unity in all\nother things, and consider the inapplicability of language to this true\nOne.\n\n\nThe Istanbul manuscript also includes one of the few copies of\nal-Kindi\u2019s On the Intellect to survive in Arabic (it is\nalso preserved in Latin translation). This is the first treatise in the\nArabic tradition to give a taxonomy of the types of intellect, such as\nwill become familiar in al-Farabi, Avicenna and Averroes. Other works\nshed further light on al-Kindi\u2019s psychology (i.e. theory of\nsoul): the Discourse on the Soul consists of supposed\nquotations from Greek philosophers, That There are Separate\nSubstances uses Aristotle\u2019s Categories to prove\nthat the soul is immaterial, and On Sleep and Dream gives an\naccount of prophetic dreams in terms of Aristotle\u2019s theory of the\nimagination. Related to al-Kindi\u2019s psychological theories is his\nonly significant surviving work on ethics, On Dispelling\nSorrows. (He also composed a collection of ethical anecdotes and\nsayings ascribed to Socrates, for which see Fakhry 1963.)\n\n\nAl-Kindi sets out his cosmological theories in two further texts\nfound in the same manuscript, On the Proximate Agent Cause of\nGeneration and Corruption and On the Prostration of the\nOutermost Sphere. Also relevant here are numerous works on\nmeteorology and weather forecasting. These apply the same cosmological\nideas to show how heavenly motion produces rain and other\nmeteorological phenomena in the lower world where we live. While these\nworks are influenced by Aristotle, al-Kindi also draws on other Greek\nsources, such as Ptolemy. His knowledge of the Greek scientific\ntradition was in fact extensive. For instance, he uses Euclid and ideas\nthat can be traced to Ptolemy in a well-known work on optics, On\nPerspectives, which is preserved only in Latin. Al-Kindi\u2019s\nextant scientific corpus is sizable and includes treatises on the\nmanufacture of drugs, music, astrology, and mathematics (see further\nRosenthal 1942). But the focus here will be on al-Kindi\u2019s\nphilosophical views.\n2. Influences on al-Kindi\n2.1 Greek influences\n\n\nAs one would expect given his prominent role in the translation\nmovement, al-Kindi\u2019s works are suffused with ideas from Greek\nthought. His philosophical works are indebted in part to the\nmathematical and scientific authors translated by his day, for\ninstance Nicomachus of Gerasa; Euclid influenced his methodology as\nwell as his mathematics (cf. Gutas 2004). But the most important\ninfluence on his philosophy was from Aristotle, whose corpus al-Kindi\nsurveys in a treatise called On the Quantity of Aristotle\u2019s\nBooks (Abu Rida 1950, 363\u201384; also Guidi and Walzer 1940,\nCortabarria Beitia 1972, Jolivet 2004, Ighbariah 2012). This work provides a fairly\nthorough overview of Aristotle\u2019s corpus, though al-Kindi clearly has\nnot read some of the treatises he discusses. When al-Kindi comes to\nmention the contents of the Metaphysics he gives the\nfollowing, rather surprising, summary:\n\n\nHis purpose in his book called Metaphysics is to explain\nthings that subsist without matter and, though they may exist together\nwith what does have matter, are neither connected nor united to matter;\nto affirm the oneness of God, the great and exalted, to explain His\nbeautiful names, and that He is the agent cause of the universe, which\nperfects [all things], the God of the universe who governs through His\nperfect providence and complete wisdom.\n\n\nWhile this may not look like an accurate description of Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics, it is a wholly accurate description of\nal-Kindi\u2019s own conception of the science of metaphysics. That he\nconflates metaphysics with theology is clear from the opening of\nOn First Philosophy, which says that since philosophy in\ngeneral is the study of truth, \u201cfirst philosophy\u201d is\n\u201cthe knowledge of the first truth who is the cause of all\ntruth.\u201d And indeed Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics is a major\ninfluence on this work. However, as is typical of al-Kindi\u2019s\nphilosophical writings, On First Philosophy also makes\nextensive use of ideas from translations of Neoplatonic writings. The\nproof for the existence of a \u201ctrue One\u201d is based in part\non Proclus (as shown in Jolivet 1979), and one can detect influences\nfrom the Arabic version of Plotinus produced in al-Kindi\u2019s circle, the\nso-called Theology of Aristotle. Perhaps the most important\nsingle influence, however, is an attack on Aristotle by the\nNeoplatonist Christian thinker John Philoponus, over the issue of the\nworld\u2019s eternity.\n\nOn First Philosophy, then, is a particularly good example of\nhow al-Kindi combines Neoplatonic and Aristotelian ideas in his vision\nof a coherent philosophy derived from the Greeks. The way for this\nsynoptic conception of the Greek inheritance had actually been prepared\nby the Neoplatonists themselves, whose commentaries on Aristotle\npresage the harmonizing tendencies obvious in al-Kindi. But as a\npromoter of Greek wisdom, al-Kindi would in any case have been eager to\ndeemphasize any tensions between Greek philosophers, or any failings on\nthe part of Greek thinkers. For example he gives no sign that his\nposition on the eternity of the world departs from that of Aristotle.\n(Interestingly he is more willing to recognize shortcomings on the part\nof Greek scientific thinkers, for instance in Euclid\u2019s optics,\nthough even here he emphasizes the need for a charitable approach.)\nLater in the first section of On First Philosophy, al-Kindi\nunleashes a torrent of abuse against unnamed contemporaries who\ncriticize the use of Greek ideas:\n\n\nWe must not be ashamed to admire the truth or to acquire it, from\nwherever it comes. Even if it should come from far-flung nations and\nforeign peoples, there is for the student of truth nothing more\nimportant than the truth, nor is the truth demeaned or diminished by\nthe one who states or conveys it; no one is demeaned by the truth,\nrather all are ennobled by it.\n\n\nAlthough al-Kindi was unyielding in his support for the ideas\ndisseminated in the translation project, he was inevitably influenced\nby the intellectual currents of his day. This comes out most clearly\nwhen al-Kindi uses Greek ideas to engage with the problems of his time,\nespecially in the arena of theology.\n2.2 Contemporary influences\n\n\nTwo examples of this engagement, to be discussed in more detail in\nthe next section, are al-Kindi\u2019s treatment of divine attributes,\nand his views on creation. As we will see al-Kindi held an austere view\non the question of attributes, on the basis that predication invariably\nimplies multiplicity, whereas God is unrestrictedly one. This has been\ncompared (Ivry 1974, Adamson 2003) to the position of the\nMu\u2018tazilites, who were the main contemporary theologians of the\nninth century. Mu\u2018tazilite influence may also be present in\nal-Kindi\u2019s theory that creation is a \u201cbringing to be of\nbeing from non-being,\u201d and especially in his denial that creation\ncan be eternal. (This may be related to the Mu\u2018tazilite claim\nthat the Koran is created and not eternal; see Adamson 2007, ch.4.)\n\n\nAl-Kindi uses philosophy to defend and explicate Islam in several\nworks. He wrote a short treatise attacking the Christian doctrine of\nthe Trinity, using concepts drawn from the Isagoge of Porphyry\n(al-Kindi\u2019s refutation was the subject of a counter-refutation by\nthe tenth century Christian philosopher, Yahya ibn \u2018Adi; see\nP\u00e9rier 1920). While this is the only extant work that engages in\ntheological controversy, we know from the Fihrist that he\nwrote other treatises on similar themes. The extant corpus also\ncontains passages in which al-Kindi expounds the meaning of passages\nfrom the Koran. Most striking, perhaps, is his discussion of creation\nex nihilo in the midst of On the Quantity of\nAristotle\u2019s Books. This passage is a commentary on Koran\n36: 79\u201382. Al-Kindi mentions the same Koranic passage, and discusses the\nspecial nature of prophetic knowledge, in a meteorological work\nentitled On Why the Higher Atmosphere is Cold (see Abu Rida\n1953, 92\u201393). The cosmological work On the Prostration of the\nOutermost Sphere, meanwhile, is entirely devoted to explaining the\nKoranic verse \u201cthe stars and the trees prostrate\nthemselves\u201d (55: 6) in terms of al-Kindi\u2019s account of\nheavenly influence on the sublunary world. Al-Kindi\u2019s remarks\nhere show his interest in the contemporary disciplines of grammar and\nKoranic exegesis.\n\n\nA desire to integrate Greek ideas into his own culture is shown in a\ndifferent way by On Definitions, a list of technical\nphilosophical terms with definitions (see Abu Rida 1950, 165\u201379;\nalso Allard 1972, Klein-Franke 1982). This work is ascribed to\nal-Kindi, and though its authenticity has been doubted it is almost\ncertainly at least a production of al-Kindi\u2019s circle. Most of the\ndefined terms correspond to Greek technical terms, and thus build up\nan Arabic philosophical terminology which is intended to be equivalent\nto that of the Greeks. It is striking that, so early in the Arabic\nphilosophical tradition, there was already a perceived need for a\nnovel technical language for communicating philosophical ideas in a\ndifferent setting (and of course for translating Greek into\nArabic). Some, though certainly not all, of the terms listed in On\nDefinitions will indeed become standard in the later\nphilosophical tradition.\n3. Metaphysics\n3.1 Divine simplicity\n\n\nAl-Kindi\u2019s most significant work, On First Philosophy\n(for which see Abu Rida 1950, 97\u2013162, Ivry 1974, Rashed and Jolivet\n1998, 9\u201399), is devoted to \u201cfirst philosophy\u201d or\nmetaphysics, a science al-Kindi immediately identifies with the study\nof God. Since all philosophy is an inquiry into truth, first philosophy\nis the knowledge of God, who is \u201cthe first truth and the cause of\nall truth.\u201d While this may not sound like it has much to do with\nAristotle\u2019s understanding of first philosophy as the science of\nbeing, al-Kindi closely associates being with truth (\u201ceverything\nthat has being has truth\u201d). For him, to say that God is the cause\nof all truth is tantamount to saying that God is the cause of all\nbeing, a point made more explicit at the end of what remains to us of\nOn First Philosophy (see further below, 3.2).\n\n\nThe central concept in the theology of On First Philosophy,\nhowever, is neither truth nor being, but oneness. Indeed al-Kindi\nargues for a first cause of being precisely by arguing for a first\ncause of oneness, and asserting that \u201cbringing something to\nbe\u201d means imposing unity of a certain kind. Al-Kindi\u2019s\nphilosophical theology thus has two main aspects: a proof that there\nmust be some \u201ctrue One\u201d that is the cause of the unity in\nall things, and a discussion of the nature of this true One. These\naspects are treated, respectively, in the third and fourth sections\nof On First Philosophy.\n\n\nIn the third section, al-Kindi first proves that nothing can be its\nown cause, a point that is not used explicitly in what follows, but\nmay be intended to show that nothing can be the cause of its own\nunity. He then undertakes an exhaustive survey of the various types of\n\u201cutterance (lafz).\u201d Following Porphyry\u2019s\nIsagoge, he classifies all predicates or terms\n(maqulat) into genus, species, difference, individual, proper\naccident, and common accident. Taking them in turn, al-Kindi argues\nthat each type of predicate implies both unity and multiplicity. For\nexample, animal is one genus, but it is made up of a\nmultiplicity of species; human is one species but is made up\nof many individuals; and a single human is one individual but made up\nof many bodily parts. Finally, al-Kindi seeks an explanation for the\nassociation of unity and multiplicity in all these things. He argues\nthat the association cannot be merely the product of chance; nor can\nit be caused by any part of the set of things that are both one and\nmany.  So there must be some external cause for the association of\nunity and multiplicity. This cause will be exclusively one, entirely\nfree of multiplicity: al-Kindi expresses this by saying that it is\n\u201cessentially\u201d one, whereas the other things are\n\u201caccidentally\u201d one. He also speaks of it as \u201cone in\ntruth,\u201d whereas other things are one\n\u201cmetaphorically.\u201d In short, the cause in question is the\n\u201ctrue One,\u201d or God.\n\n\nNow, since we have already seen that every sort of term or\nexpression implies multiplicity as well as unity, it is no surprise\nthat in section four of One First Philosophy al-Kindi goes on\nto argue that the various sorts of predicate are inapplicable to the\ntrue One. He sums up his conclusion as follows (Rashed and Jolivet\n1998, 95):\n\n\nThus the true One possesses no matter, form, quantity, quality, or\nrelation. And is not described by any of the other terms: it has no\ngenus, no specific difference, no individual, no proper accident, and\nno common accident. It does not move, and is not described through\nanything that is denied to be one in truth. It is therefore only pure\nunity, I mean nothing other than unity. And every unity other than it\nis multiple.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, this conclusion has been compared to the view of\nthose contemporary theologians referred to as Mu\u2018tazilites. They\nsimilarly took a strict view on the question of divine attributes,\narguing that God\u2019s simplicity ruled out the acceptance of any\nattributes distinct from God\u2019s essence. However it is Greek\nantecedents that are clearly the main influence on al-Kindi here. His\n\u201ctrue One\u201d bears a strong resemblance to the first\nprinciple of the Neoplatonists. Indeed we might be reminded of Plato\nhimself, insofar as al-Kindi\u2019s God seems to function like a\nPlatonic Form. Just as the Form of Equal is entirely equal and not at\nall unequal, and serves to explain equality in other things, so God is\nentirely one, not at all multiple, and explains the unity in other\nthings.\n3.2 Creation\n\n\nThis is, however, only a part of al-Kindi\u2019s view on divine\ncausation. Because, as we have seen, al-Kindi thinks that to be a thing\nof a certain kind is to be one in a certain way, he infers that the\ntrue One is the cause of being as well as unity (see further Adamson\n2002b). In particular, he believes that God is an \u201cagent\u201d\nor efficient cause. This view is expressed in a succinct text (possibly\na fragment from a longer, lost work) headed with the title On the\nTrue, First, Complete Agent and the Deficient Agent that is\nMetaphorically [an Agent] (Abu Rida 1950, 182\u20134). The\ntext begins as follows:\n\n\nWe say that the true, first act is the bringing-to-be of beings from\nnon-being. It is clear that this act is proper to God, the exalted, who\nis the end of every cause. For the bringing-to-be of beings from\nnon-being belongs to no other. And this act is a proper characteristic\n[called] by the name \u201corigination.\u201d\n\n\nAl-Kindi goes on to explain that whereas God is a \u201ctrue\u201d\nagent, since He is a cause of being and acts without being acted upon,\nall other agents are only \u201cmetaphorically\u201d agents, because\nthey both act and are acted upon. The force of the term\n\u201cmetaphorical\u201d here is the same as it was in On First\nPhilosophy: just as created things are both many and one, and thus\nnot \u201ctruly\u201d one, so they are both passive and active, and\nthus not \u201ctruly\u201d agents.\n\n\nThis short text raises two interesting questions about how al-Kindi\nconceived of divine action. First, what does he have in mind when he\ndescribes God\u2019s agency as being mediated by the action of\n\u201cmetaphorical agents\u201d (God \u201cis the proximate cause\nfor the first effect, and a cause through an intermediary for His\neffects that are after the first effect\u201d)? Second, what is\ninvolved in \u201cbringing being to be from non-being\u201d?\n\n\nRegarding the first question, one might suppose that al-Kindi is\nfollowing Neoplatonic texts, and that he has in mind a mediated\nemanation of effects from the first principle. If this is right, then\nthe \u201cfirst effect\u201d will be the \u201cworld of the\nintellect\u201d mentioned in other Kindian texts (e.g. the\nDiscourse on the Soul, repeating this phrase from the\nTheology of Aristotle). This is supported by a non-committal\nremark in On First Philosophy that \u201cone might think the\nintellect is the first multiple\u201d (Rashed and Jolivet 1998, 87).\nBut it seems at least as likely that the \u201cfirst effect\u201d\nmentioned here is the world of the heavens: by creating the heavens and\nsetting them in motion, God indirectly brings about things in the\nsublunary world (see further below, 5.2). This would be a more\nAristotelian version of the idea that divine causation is mediated.\n\n\nRegarding the second question, the idea that God is an agent\ncause of being may likewise seem at first to be a departure\nfrom Aristotle. But in fact Neoplatonist authors like Ammonius had\nexplicitly argued that Aristotle\u2019s God was an efficient cause of\nbeing, not just a final cause of motion. And a passage in On the\nQuantity of Aristotle\u2019s Books \u2014 the aforementioned\ndiscussion of Koran 36: 79\u201382 \u2014 understands creation on the\nmodel of Aristotelian change, in which something passes from one\ncontrary to another. In the case of creation, one contrary is\n\u201cnon-being\u201d and the other \u201cbeing.\u201d Al-Kindi\u2019s\ndiscussion of this has parallels in ninth century theological\ndiscussions of creation (see Adamson 2003). But his main source,\nsurprisingly, is Ammonius\u2019 student John Philoponus, a Christian\nNeoplatonist who had also spoken of creation as bringing something to\nbe \u201cfrom non-being.\u201d What separates al-Kindi and\nPhiloponus from Aristotle is their idea that this kind of\n\u201cchange\u201d from non-being to being requires no subject. For\nexample, for there to be a change from non-white to white, there must\nbe some subject or substrate for both the privation of the whiteness\nand the whiteness itself (for instance the fence that goes from being\nnon-white to being white when it is painted). God, by contrast, can\nbring about being ex nihilo, with no subject for the change.\nAl-Kindi emphasizes also that God\u2019s creative act requires no time to\nbe realized.\n3.3 Eternity of the world\n\n\nThese two points bring us to a more extensive use of Philoponus by\nal-Kindi, in the latter\u2019s well-known argument that the world is\nnot eternal (for which see Davidson 1969 and 1987, and Staley 1987).\nMost Greek philosophers followed Aristotle in holding that the world is\neternal, meaning not only that it will never cease to exist, but that\nit has always existed. This was the doctrine of Aristotle and the\nStoics, and also of orthodox Neoplatonists, who interpreted\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus as likewise committed to the past\neternity of the world. Philoponus was an exception to this rule. In a\nwork rebutting the Neoplatonist Proclus\u2019 arguments in favor of\nthe world\u2019s eternity, he argued at great length that\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus rightly envisions a world with a\nbeginning in time. And in another work directed against Aristotle,\nPhiloponus tried to undermine the arguments of the De Caelo\nand Physics by which Aristotle had shown that the world is\neternal.\n\n\nIn section two of On First Philosophy, and several other\nshort works that repeat the same arguments found in this section,\nal-Kindi follows arguments that derive from Philoponus. (Exactly which\ntext or texts by Philoponus he used is unclear, but it would seem that\nhe at least knew parts of Against Aristotle.) Interestingly,\nal-Kindi completely ignores a major aspect of Philoponus\u2019\npolemic: in the De Caelo, Aristotle had argued that the\nheavens must be eternal, because they have perfect, circular motion and\nare therefore not made out of any of the corruptible four elements of\nour lower world. Whereas Philoponus attacks this cosmology with a\nlengthy and detailed refutation, al-Kindi simply accepts that the\nheavens are made out of an ungenerable and indestructible fifth element\n\u2013 but blithely adds that they are nonetheless originally brought\ninto being by God with a beginning in time. (For this see the treatise\nThat the Nature of the Celestial Sphere is Different from the\nNatures of the Four Elements, edited at Abu Rida 1953, 40\u20136.)\n\n\nWhen al-Kindi comes to argue explicitly against the eternity of the\nworld, he uses Philoponus\u2019 strategy of using Aristotle against\nhimself. Aristotle famously held that there can be no such thing as an\nactual infinite. Thus, for instance, the body of the world cannot be\ninfinitely large. Because the cosmos is finite in spatial magnitude,\nargues al-Kindi, nothing predicated of the body of the cosmos can be\ninfinite. Since time is one of the things predicated of this body, time\nmust be finite; therefore the world is not eternal.\n\n\nThis argument seems to be a poor one. Even if Aristotle admits that\nnothing infinite can be predicated of a finite body, he will want to\nsay that al-Kindi\u2019s argument fails to take full account of the\ndistinction between actual and merely potential\ninfinities. An actual infinity is an infinity which is simultaneously\npresent in its entirety \u2013 for example, an infinitely large body,\nor in general any set with an infinite number of members existing at\nthe same time. A potential infinity is when a finite magnitude can be\nextended or multiplied indefinitely. For example, Aristotle thinks\nthat any finite magnitude of space or time is potentially infinite, in\nthat it can in principle be divided into as many parts as one wishes,\nwith smaller divisions still possible. The body of the cosmos, as\nal-Kindi admits himself, is also potentially infinite, in the sense\nthat there is nothing conceptually impossible about increasing its\nsize indefinitely. Notice, though, that in either case the actual\nresult of such a process will be finite: any determinate addition to\nthe size of a body will still yield a body of finite size. Likewise,\nno matter how finely I divide a body, any particular act of division\nwill yield a finite number of parts.\n\n\nNow, Aristotle believes that the eternity of the world commits him\nonly to a potential infinity. This is because saying that the\nworld has always existed does not imply that any infinity is\npresently actual. Rather, it implies only that \u201cthe\nworld has already existed for N years\u201d will be true for\nany value of N. One can, so to speak, go as far as one wishes into the\npast, positing increasingly large (but still finite) periods of past\ntime, just as one can divide a body as finely as one wishes. And it is\nfar from clear that this sort of potential infinity is\ninapplicable to a finite magnitude. Does al-Kindi have any response to\nthis?\n\n\nHe does, though his response comes only at the end of his treatment\nof the world\u2019s eternity. The response, found also in Philoponus,\nis that even to reach the present moment, an actually infinite number\nof moments must already have elapsed. In other words, there is\ncurrently an actually infinite number of moments (or years, or\nwhatever) that have elapsed \u201csince the world began.\u201d And,\nas Aristotle himself says, the infinite cannot be traversed. Whether\nthis argument is successful is unclear. It seems to presuppose that we\nselect an infinitely distant point in past time, and then reckon the\nnumber of years that have elapsed since then. But Aristotle will\npresumably want to block the initial move of selecting an infinitely\ndistant point in past time, insisting that any particular\npoint we choose in the past will be removed from the present by a\nmerely finite number of years.\n4. Psychology\n4.1 The human soul\n\n\nWe have two works by al-Kindi devoted to the ontology of the human\nsoul: That There are Incorporeal Substances and Discourse\non the Soul. The two depend on very different Greek sources, and\nare very different in rhetorical presentation. But the doctrine that\nemerges from them is not necessarily inconsistent.\n\nThat There are Incorporeal Substances (Abu Rida 1950,\n265\u201369, Adamson and Pormann 2009) is a creative application of\nideas from Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories to the problem of showing that the human soul is\nan immaterial substance. Al-Kindi takes up this task in stages, first\nproving that the soul is a substance, then showing that it is\nimmaterial. He argues that the soul is a substance by drawing on the\nopening chapters of the Categories to claim that the essence\nof something shares a name and definition with that thing. Since the\nsoul is the essence of the living being, and the living being is a\nsubstance, the soul is also a substance. Furthermore, it is an\nimmaterial substance: for the soul is \u201cthe intellectual form of\nthe living thing,\u201d and an intellectual form is a species. But\nspecies, al-Kindi argues, are immaterial; therefore the soul is\nimmaterial. Among the problematic moves in this train of argument is\nthe identification of the human soul with the species of human. This\nwould seem to be al-Kindi\u2019s attempt to bring together the idea of\nspecies, which is a \u201csecondary substance\u201d in the\nCategories, with the doctrine of form found in such works as\nthe De Anima and Metaphysics. Al-Kindi simply\nconflates the two, without argument \u2013 he does not address the\nobvious question of how there can be many human souls, all of which\nare identical with the single species human.\n\n\nApart from brief opening and closing remarks, Discourse on the\nSoul (Abu Rida 1950, 272\u201380; also D\u2019Ancona 1996,\nGenequand 1987, Jolivet 1996) consists entirely of supposed quotes\nfrom Greek authorities \u2013 Plato, Pythagoras, and Aristotle\n\u2013 about the nature of the soul. The actual sources used are\nunclear, though the Republic is the ultimate source for a\nsection describing Plato\u2019s tripartite soul. The section on Aristotle\nis a fable about a Greek king, and has nothing to do with any extant\nAristotelian work. The tenor of these remarks is hortatory, ascetic\nand even visionary: our task is to cleanse our souls from the\n\u201cstains\u201d that adhere to it from the body, and to ascend\nthrough the heavenly spheres, ultimately to the \u201cworld of the\nintellect\u201d where it will reside in \u201cthe light of the\nCreator.\u201d The soul in question here would seem to be the\nrational soul: the lower parts of Plato\u2019s tripartite soul (the\nirascible and concupiscent parts) are described as faculties seated in\nthe body.  The point of this psychological doxography is not unlike\nthat of Incorporeal Substances: the soul is a \u201csimple\nsubstance,\u201d separate from body. Indeed this is presented as the\noverall message of the treatise in al-Kindi\u2019s closing remarks.\n4.2 Epistemology\n\n\nThis rigorously dualist psychology has far-reaching effects in\nal-Kindi\u2019s epistemology and ethics. It is clear from the\nDiscourse that when al-Kindi speaks of the soul as separate\nfrom body, even during our worldly life, he is referring only to the\nintellective or rational soul. While this does not by itself rule out\nthat intellection and reason are somehow grounded in bodily experience,\nal-Kindi does not pursue an empiricist program in contexts where he\naddresses epistemological issues.\n\n\nThe most important text on epistemology is al-Kindi\u2019s\nbest-known work apart from On First Philosophy, namely On\nthe Intellect (Abu Rida 1950, 353\u20138; also McCarthy 1964,\nRuffinengo 1997). This treatise has received an unusual amount of\nattention, despite its brevity and compressed argument, because it is\nthe first Arabic work to show the influence of Greek taxonomies of the\nintellect into levels or types. (See especially Jolivet 1971, with\nEndress 1980.) These taxonomies, with various versions put forward by\nAlexander, Themistius, Philoponus and other commentators, were in turn\nattempts to systematize Aristotle\u2019s remarks on intellect in\nDe Anima book 3 and elsewhere.\n\n\nFar from grounding intellect in sensation, al-Kindi argues in On\nthe Intellect that the human intellect has a parallel, but\nseparate, function to human sense-perception. (For a similar contrast\nsee also On First Philosophy, section 2.) Just like sensation,\nthe human intellect in itself begins in a state of potentiality. This\nis the first type of intellect, the potential intellect, which is\nmerely an ability to grasp intellectual forms. Once it grasps a form\nand is actually thinking, it becomes \u201cactual intellect.\u201d We\nare then able to think about these forms at will. Our ability to do so\nis what al-Kindi calls the \u201cacquired intellect\u201d (not to be\nconfused with \u201cacquired intellect\u201d in al-Farabi, who means\nby this a comprehensive attainment of the many intellectual forms).\nNotice that these types of intellect are really only the same, human\nintellect in three different states: wholly potential, wholly actual,\nand temporarily potential but able to actualize at will.\n\n\nBut how in the first place do we get from potential intellect to\nactual intellection? It is here that al-Kindi might have told some sort\nof empiricist story, perhaps involving abstraction; such a story plays\nat least some role in al-Kindi\u2019s successors al-Farabi and\nAvicenna. But instead al-Kindi gives a thoroughly intellectualist\naccount of how we come to think, one which is parallel to, but distinct\nfrom, his account of sensation. Just as sensation is actualized by an\nexternal sensible form, so intellect is actualized by an external\nintelligible form. This form will reside in the final type of\nintellect, the \u201cfirst intellect,\u201d which is al-Kindi\u2019s\nversion of the infamous \u201cmaker intellect\u201d in\nAristotle\u2019s De Anima 3.5. While it is unclear what\nposition this first intellect is meant to have in al-Kindi\u2019s\nontology, it is clear that it is distinct from human intellect. The\nfirst intellect is \u201calways in act,\u201d which means that it can\nserve as an external source for intelligible forms, just as sensible\nobject serves as an external source for a sensible form.\n\n\nWe get some sense of how al-Kindi might have applied this highly\nintellectualist epistemology in specific contexts from works on\nrecollection and on dreams. His On Recollection (for which see\nEndress 1986 and 1994) argues explicitly that we cannot derive\nintelligible forms from sense-perception. Thus we do not\n\u201clearn\u201d these forms, but simply \u201cremember\u201d them\nfrom before the soul entered into the body. Here al-Kindi is of course\nbroadly following the account of recollection given by Plato in the\nMeno or Phaedo, though how he might have known of\nthis account remains obscure. (Most likely it is from an Arabic\nversion, perhaps in summary, of the Phaedo.)\n\n\nA longer and more detailed text is On Sleep and Dream (Abu\nRida 1950, 293\u2013311; also Ruffinengo 1997), which gives a naturalistic\naccount of why prophetic dreams occur, and how they may be interpreted.\nHere al-Kindi\u2019s chief source was Aristotle\u2019s Parva\nNaturalia, which include the works On Sleep, On\nDreams, and On Prophecy in Sleep. The extant Arabic\nversion of these texts, which may well be related to the version used\nby al-Kindi, is importantly different from the Greek version, in that\nit admits that genuinely prophetic dreams can be sent from God (cf.\nPines 1974). If al-Kindi knew this version then he follows it only in\npart: he embraces the idea of prophetic dreams, but does not claim that\nthey come to us from God. To explain dreams al-Kindi invokes a faculty\nwe have not yet discussed, namely imagination or phantasia.\nFollowing Aristotle, al-Kindi says that dreams occur when we are\nsleeping because the senses are no longer active, and the imagination\nhas free rein to conjure up forms on its own. We are also given a\nphysiological account of sleep, which departs from Aristotle by placing\nthe imaginative faculty in the brain. Whereas Aristotle has some\ndifficulty explaining, and is in fact rather skeptical about, the\nphenomenon of prophetic dreams, al-Kindi is enthusiastic about them. He\neven explains the various types of dream, with their accuracy\ndetermined by the physical state of the brain. But despite the\nphysiological aspects of al-Kindi\u2019s account, the fundamental\nexplanatory work is done by the incorporeal soul, which\n\u201cannounces\u201d its visions of the future to the imagination.\nAgain, the rational soul grasps its objects by itself. Tellingly,\nal-Kindi thinks that sensation hinders this power of the soul, rather\nthan contributing anything to it.\n4.3 Application to ethics\n\n\nGiven that al-Kindi sharply divides the rational soul from the body\nand the lower psychological faculties, and that he sees the rational\nsoul as our true \u201cself\u201d or \u201cessence\u201d and as the\nonly part of us that survives the death of the body, it is no surprise\nthat his ethical thought is likewise highly intellectualist.\nUnfortunately, the numerous works on ethical and political topics\nascribed to him in the Fihrist are almost all lost. The most\nsignificant remaining text is On Dispelling Sadness (Ritter\nand Walzer 1938, also Butterworth 1992, Druart 1993, Jayyusi-Lehn 2002,\nMestiri and Dye 2004). This is also the work of al-Kindi that will be\nmost often cited by subsequent thinkers, for example by Miskawayh in\nhis Tahdhib al-Akhlaq (The Refinement of\nCharacter).\n\nOn Dispelling Sadness, as its title indicates, is a work in\nthe genre of philosophical consolation. Much of the text consists in\npractical advice, maxims and anecdotes that one may bear in mind when\none finds oneself affected by sorrow. One particularly striking passage\nallegorizes our earthly life as a temporary landfall during a sea\nvoyage; this image derives ultimately from Epictetus. The philosophical\nfoundations of the treatise, though, are laid in the early sections,\nwhere al-Kindi gives a principled argument against placing value on\nphysical objects. By their very nature, he says, wealth and other\nphysical goods are vulnerable and transitory. No one can be sure that\ntheir possessions will not be taken from them \u2013 they may\n\u201cbe seized by any power.\u201d And more crucially, the very fact\nthat they are physical means that they are subject to generation and\ncorruption, and are therefore fleeting. Instead, we should value and\npursue things that are stable and enduring, and that cannot be taken\nfrom us: these will be the things in the now familiar \u201cworld of\nthe intellect.\u201d To the extent that one\u2019s desires are\ndirected solely towards intelligible things, one will be invulnerable\nto sadness. This argument, then, shows that sadness is always needless.\nThe anecdotes and more practical \u201cremedies\u201d offered in the\nrest of the treatise are intended to make it easier for us to accept\nand live in accordance with this conclusion.\n5. Science\n5.1 The use of mathematics\n\n\nDespite the anti-empiricist character of al-Kindi\u2019s epistemology noted\nabove, he devoted enormous energy to various branches of the physical\nsciences. Particularly well represented in the extant corpus are his\nwork on optics and medicine, especially the compounding of drugs (for\noptics see Rashed 1997; for medicine see Gauthier 1939, Klein-Franke\n1975, Celentano 1979; for these aspects of al-Kindi\u2019s thought\ngenerally see Adamson 2007, ch.7). What is characteristic about\nal-Kindi\u2019s approach to such topics is the use of mathematics. It has\nbeen persuasively argued that mathematics was fundamental to\nal-Kindi\u2019s own philosophical method (Gutas 2004, cf. Endress 2003); a\ngood example is his mathematical approach to Aristotle\u2019s categories,\nwhich makes quantity and quality fundamental for Aristotelian logic\n(Ighbariah 2012). Certainly he missed no opportunity to apply\nmathematical techniques to what we would now think of as\n\u201cscientific\u201d topics. In addition, he wrote numerous works\non music (edited in Zakariyya\u2019 1962), which for the ancients and\nal-Kindi himself was a branch of the mathematical sciences. He also\nwrote extensively on more recognizably mathematical topics, as is\nattested by the Fihrist, though again much of this material\nis lost.\n\n\nA good example of how al-Kindi applied mathematics to other fields\nis his use of geometry in optics (see further Lindberg 1971, Rashed\n1997, Adamson 2006). On this subject al-Kindi followed the tradition\ninaugurated by Euclid, and carried on by Ptolemy and others, in which\ngeometrical constructions were used to explain phenomena such as visual\nperspective, shadows, refraction, reflection, and burning mirrors. This\nprocedure implies that light and vision can be formalized as\ngeometrical lines, an implication that al-Kindi and his sources embrace\nby claiming that vision occurs when \u201crays\u201d emitted from the\neyes along straight lines strike a visual object. Likewise, objects are\nilluminated when a light source emits light rays that strike the\nobjects\u2019 surfaces. Aspects of al-Kindi\u2019s account anticipate\nthat of Ibn al-Haytham, who some decades later would be the first to\nexplain vision accurately.\n\n\nNow, this account based on \u201crays\u201d also seems to underlie\nal-Kindi\u2019s most ambitious work on the physical sciences: a\nlengthy treatise entitled On Rays (de Radiis, for\nwhich see D\u2019Alverny and Hudry 1974) and preserved only in Latin.\nThere is some question as to its authenticity, but it seems plausible\nthat On Rays represents al-Kindi\u2019s attempt to explain\nall physical interaction \u2013 from heating and cooling, to vision,\nto astral influence, to magical incantations \u2013 in terms of a\nfundamentally geometrical mechanism. (For connections to the optical\nworks, see Travaglia 1999.)\n5.2 Cosmology\n\n\nA central part of On Rays explains that the stars and\nplanets bring about events in the sublunary world by means of rays\nemitted from the heavenly bodies to points on the earth\u2019s\nsurface. This differs from an account found in several other\ncosmological treatises by al-Kindi, where he follows Alexander of\nAphrodisias in holding that the heavenly bodies literally heat up the\nlower world by means of friction as they pass over it. In either case,\nhowever, the account given is intended to explain the efficacy of the\nscience of astrology. Al-Kindi wrote numerous works on this subject,\nand his associate Abu Ma\u2018shar was the greatest figure in Arabic\nastrology. Both of them saw astrology as a rational science,\nundergirded by a well-worked out theory of physical causes (see further\nBurnett 1993, Adamson 2002a).\n\n\nAl-Kindi\u2019s corpus includes several treatises on cosmology,\nexplaining and defending a picture of the cosmos as four concentric\ncircles of elements, which are mixed together by the outer, heavenly\nspheres to yield complex compound substances like minerals, plants, and\nanimals. Though al-Kindi\u2019s main influences are works of Aristotle\nand his commentators, especially Alexander, he also knows something of\nthe Timaeus, as is shown by a treatise explaining why Plato\nassociated the elements and heavens with the Platonic solids (Abu Rida\n1953, 54\u201363; also Rescher 1968).\n\n\nOne respect in which al-Kindi follows Alexander is his conviction that\nthe heavenly spheres are the means by which God exercises providence\nover the sublunary world (see Fazzo and Wiesner 1993).  Al-Kindi\u2019s\nbold claims for astrology already commit him to the idea that a wide\nrange of specific events can be predicted on the basis of astral\ncausation. His doctrine of providence goes further by implying that\nall events in the lower world are caused by the stars,\nwhich are carrying out the benign \u201ccommand\u201d of God. This\ndoctrine is set out in On the Prostration of the Outermost\nSphere (Abu Rida 1950, 244\u2013261, Rashed and Jolivet 1998, 177\u201399)\nand On the Proximate Agent Cause of Generation and Corruption\n(Abu Rida 1950, 214\u2013237). The former explains that the heavens are\npossessed of souls, and freely follow God\u2019s command so as to move in\nsuch a way that the providentially intended sublunary things and\nevents will come about. This, according to al-Kindi, is what the Koran\nrefers to when it says that the stars \u201cprostrate\u201d\nthemselves before God. In Proximate Agent Cause, meanwhile,\nal-Kindi gives a more detailed account of the means by which the\nheavens cause things in the lower world (here he invokes friction, not\nrays). The most obvious effect of the stars on our world is of course\nthe seasons, because the sun (due to its size and proximity) is the\nheavenly body with the most powerful effect. If there were no such\nheavenly causation, according to al-Kindi, the elements would never\nhave combined at all, and the lower realm would consist of four\nspheres of unmixed earth, water, air and fire.\n\n\nAl-Kindi\u2019s account of astral causation and providence is a very good\nexample of his philosophical method: combining and building on ideas\ntaken from Aristotle, later Greek philosophers, and\n\u201cscientific\u201d authors like Ptolemy, he gives a rational\naccount of a central concept in Islam. Prostration shows that\nhe is even willing to use such an account to expound the Koran itself.\nAl-Kindi is confident that, once exposed to judicious presentations of\nGreek wisdom, his more enlightened contemporaries and sponsors will\nagree that these foreign texts can be used \u2014 jointly with\nautochthonous \u201cArabic\u201d disciplines like grammar \u2014 in\nthe service of a deeper understanding of Islam itself.\n6. Legacy\n\n\nAl-Kindi\u2019s optimism on this score was not necessarily borne\nout in subsequent generations. But among thinkers influenced by\nal-Kindi, one can discern a continuing tendency to harmonize\n\u201cforeign\u201d philosophy with the \u201cindigenous\u201d\ndevelopments of Muslim culture. This is one feature of what might be\ncalled the \u201cKindian tradition,\u201d an intellectual current\nthat runs up through the tenth century, which is most obviously\nrepresented by first and second generation students of\nal-Kindi\u2019s. Particularly prominent among these figures is\nal-\u2018Amiri, a well-known Neoplatonist thinker who was a second\ngeneration student of al-Kindi\u2019s (the link was al-Kindi\u2019s\nstudent Abu Zayd al-Balkhi). Also influenced by al-Kindi were the\nJewish thinker Isaac Israeli (on whom see Altmann and Stern 1958) and\nthe aforementioned tenth century polymath Miskawayh.\n\n\nWhile al-Kindi is only rarely cited by authors writing in Arabic\nlater than the tenth century, he was a significant figure for Latin\nmedieval authors. Most influential were his works on astrology (see\nBurnett 1999); but works like On the Intellect were also\ntranslated, and as noted above there are works in the Kindian corpus\nthat are extant only in Latin. One of these, On Rays, was the\ntarget of a polemic composed by Giles of Rome.\n\n\nTo this we might add that philosophy in the Islamic world was itself\na broader legacy of al-Kindi\u2019s, and this in two respects.\nFirstly, the translations produced in the Kindi circle would become\nstandard philosophical texts for centuries to come \u2013 particularly\ninfluential would be their translations of certain Aristotelian works\n(such as the Metaphysics) and of Plotinus, in the Theology\nof Aristotle. Secondly, though authors like al-Farabi and Averroes\nhardly mention al-Kindi by name (al-Farabi never does so, and Averroes\ndoes so only to criticize his pharmacological theory), they are\ncarrying on his philhellenic project, in which the practice of\nphilosophy is defined by an engagement with Greek philosophical\nworks.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abu Rida, M.\u2018A.H.
