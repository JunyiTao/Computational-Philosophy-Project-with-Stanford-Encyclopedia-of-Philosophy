She also explains\nhow and why this method works; in doing so, she employs her account of\nhuman nature and the way that it can degenerate into ignorance.\n\nFor Astell, the issue of knowledge and ignorance is always also an\nissue of health and disease. As stated above, Astell, like the\nCambridge Platonists, holds that the human being is\n\u201cdeiform,\u201d it is divinely imbued with a \u201cparticle of\nDivinity\u201d that exists \u201cwithin\u201d it\u2019s soul\n(Astell SP, 53). (For a discussion of deiform in Cambridge Platonists,\nsee Gill, chapters 1\u20133.) When a person is healthy, this divinity\nwithin expresses itself as a \u201cspark of Piety\u201d (107). But\nwhen people internalize prejudices that they have learned from the\n\u201cTyrant Custom\u201d (67), they do not nurture this particle of\nDivinity, but rather they develop a \u201cspiritual\u201d\n\u201cdisease\u201d (84, 88, 102, 74), a disease which comes with\nmany prejudices. Healing will come to the Ladies who enter the\nReligious Retirement when they learn how to transform every\n\u201cSpot\u201d that has turned into a prejudice that is marring\n\u201cthe beauty of [their] lovely Soul[s]\u201d (87).\n\nIn order to heal, the \u201cLadies\u201d at the Religious Retirement\nwill engage in individual and communal spiritual practices that teach\nthem how to \u201clook into\u201d their own souls (41),\n\u201cinto\u201d each other\u2019s souls (100), and into the\n\u201cSoul\u201d of the \u201chappy Society\u201d itself (87).\nWhen a person practices \u201clooking into\u201d the souls of\noneself, one\u2019s fellow, and one\u2019s community, her body and\nsoul will gather with these additional bodies and souls such that they\nform into \u201cone body, whose Soul is love\u201d (87). When each\nperson in the group does this, then each person\u2019s spark gathers\nwith each other person\u2019s spark. Together, these sparks unite\ninto one, \u201cbreathing forth it self in flames of holy desires\nafter GOD and acts of Benevolence to each other\u201d (87).\n\nAstell maintains that as these Ladies engage in these practices, they\nwill get closer to attaining a perfected spiritual condition that\nconsists in piety, apprehension of truth, generosity, and friendship,\neach of which is needed for these Ladies to engage in their proper\nvocations.\n",
