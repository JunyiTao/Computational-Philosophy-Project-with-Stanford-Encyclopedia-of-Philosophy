    "main_text": "Aristotelian Tenets, Platonic Tenets, and More || Old Cosmologies, New Cosmologies\n4.2 Old Cosmologies, New Cosmologies\n\nThe rigid peripatetic division of the universe into two different\nparts\u2014one immutable and made of crystalline spheres, situated\nbetween the fixed stars and the moon, the other mutable, under the\nmoon\u2014was also related in the Aristotelian paradigm to the\nconcept of the natural sublunar world formed by the four elements:\nfire, air, water, and earth. Every element behaves differently,\naccording to its so-called \u201cnatural movement\u201d. Light\nelements, such as fire and air, always tend to go upward, while heavy\nelements, such as water and earth, move downward following a\nrectilinear movement. Every element aims, in fact, to reach its own\nnatural place, unless an external force causes a movement opposite to\nits nature\u2014a \u201cviolent movement\u201d (e.g., a stone\nthrown into the air). In both cases, Aristotelian theory considers\nmovement as a quality common to all natural things because of the\nelements which compose them. By contrast, the heavens, since perfect\nand composed by a single element (aether), are immutable and travel in\nconstant circular motion around an immovable center represented by\nEarth. An important corollary to the theory of natural places was the\nfinite character of the world, because it implied the existence of a\nunique center (the Earth), while evidently it would not be possible\nfor an infinite universe to have a center.\n\nThese longstanding paradigms were destined to be challenged from the\nsixteenth century onward, both from a speculative and an empirical\nperspective. Observation of stellae novae and comets\ncondemned the crystalline spheres and raised doubts regarding the\ndoctrine of the immutability of heavens. According to the traditional\nAristotelian account, comets were phenomena in the sublunar\natmosphere. The great astronomer Johannes Regiomontanus\n(1436\u20131476) did not challenge this vision of the cosmos when he\ncalculated the distance of the 1472 comet by considering the angle of\nparallax, but about a century later, the Jesuit Christopher Clavius\n(1538\u20131612), observing a nova (1572), and Tycho Brahe\n(1546\u20131601), observing a comet (1577), both demonstrated that\nthe suddenly bright star and the comet must lie beyond the moon, and\nthat therefore the doctrine of the spheres was false. The demonstrated\nfluidity of heavens also compromised, more crucially, the doctrine of\ntheir immutability. Two factors made possible such an achievement: the\navailability of better measuring instruments, and a stronger emphasis\non mathematics. This emphasis on mathematics was probably the most\nimportant contribution of Platonism to the development of natural\nphilosophy, and in particular astronomy, during the Renaissance.\nThough it is true that Neoplatonic philosophers had proposed\nalternatives to the Peripatetic theories on the heavens (e.g.,\nMarsilio Ficino argued that the heavens were made of spiritus\nand rejected the division of the universe into spheres), it was their\ninsistence on the importance of geometry and mathematics that helped\nopening the way to the quantitative vision of the world, which\ngradually replaced the qualitative paradigm connected to the\nAristotelian tradition.\n\nThe decision of Nicolaus Copernicus (1473\u20131543) to propose a\nheliocentric system, remove the Earth from the center of the universe,\nand establish a relationship between the distances of the different\nplanets from the sun and the amplitude of their orbits was based on\nmathematical reasoning and the weaknesses of Aristotelian-Ptolemaic\nsystem in this regard. Johannes Kepler (1571\u20131630) defended the\nCopernican theory by re-utilizing geometrical arguments from\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus, and he also developed other theories\n(such as the elliptical form of the planetary orbits) founded on the\ngeometrical structure that he attributed to the universe. Despite the\nfact that aspects of his method, and in particular the\nregressus, were essentially Aristotelian, Galileo Galilei\n(1564\u20131642) has been often described as a Platonist, insofar as\nPlatonism endorsed a mathematical approach. Galileo denied the reality\nof the physical elements of the Aristotelian world and the theory of\ntheir natural movements, and replaced them with corporeal matter,\nwhose properties and motions could be described in mathematical terms.\nFurthermore, by relying on new instruments such as the telescope,\nGalileo was also able to make new observations which revealed the\nimperfections of the supralunar world. Galileo and the Copernican\ntheory met with the resistance of the Church, but also of the\nuniversities, whose professoriate was not eager to renounce one of the\ncentral pillars of its teaching. On the other hand, the Tychonic\nsystem elaborated by Brahe, which attempted to conciliate the\ntraditional Aristotelian-Ptolemaic cosmology with Copernicus,\nencountered support even among Jesuit scientists.\n\nHowever, neither mathematics nor fresh observations were capable of\nresolving the problem of the nature of the universe: was it finite or\ninfinite? Is there only one world or do multiple worlds exist?\nAccording to the Aristotelians the universe must be finite, because it\nis impossible to have an infinite body in act, and Copernicus and his\nfollowers also endorsed the finitude of the heavens. Theology,\nhowever, offered arguments against the finitude of the universe:\nNicholas of Cusa (1401\u20131464) connected the infinity of God to\nthe infinity of heavens, and Palingenio Stellato (or Pierangelo\nManzolli, 1500/3\u20131543 ca.), in his Zodiacus Vitae,\ncompiled themes from different traditions (e.g., the Aristotelian\nspheres and the Platonic ideas), describing a universe made of\ninfinite light in order to celebrate the glory of God. Francisco\nSuarez (1548\u20131617), and a few years later the\nConimbricenses, also defended the existence of an infinite\nspace, even if it was only an imaginary one, combining Peripatetic\ndoctrines with theological ones (above all the omnipresence of God,\nwhich cannot be limited by a finite space). Giordano Bruno used the\nrelationship between God and His creation to argue for the infinity of\nthe world. Bruno\u2019s position was in complete opposition to the\nAristotelian cosmology: the spheres are broken, there is no hierarchy\nbetween the different parts of the world and no center, and therefore\nthe natural movements are rejected. Bruno developed his theory of\ninfinity not only by relying on metaphysical arguments, but also on a\nradical revision of the Aristotelian definition of space, which he\nunderstood as a continuous quantity. Bruno\u2019s proposal provoked\nreactions all over Europe: Kepler rejected it several times in\ndifferent ways. Nevertheless, Kepler agreed with Bruno\u2019s belief\nin the plurality of worlds\u2014a problem which raised theological\nissues because of the question of salvation. Tommaso\nCampanella\u2014an author who denied the infinity of the\nuniverse\u2014resolved it by arguing that the inhabitants of the\nother worlds were not men, and therefore did not need to be saved by\nGod.\n",
