    "main_text": "Roots of Behaviorism\n3. Roots of Behaviorism\n\nEach of methodological, psychological, and analytical behaviorism has\nhistorical foundations. Analytical behaviorism traces its historical\nroots to the philosophical movement known as Logical Positivism (see\nSmith 1986). Logical positivism proposes that the meaning of\nstatements used in science must be understood in terms of experimental\nconditions or observations that verify their truth. This positivist\ndoctrine is known as \u201cverificationism.\u201d In psychology,\nverificationism underpins or grounds analytical behaviorism, namely,\nthe claim that mental concepts refer to behavioral tendencies and so\nmust be translated into behavioral terms.\n\nAnalytical behaviorism helps to avoid a metaphysical position known as\nsubstance dualism. Substance dualism is the doctrine that mental\nstates take place in a special, non-physical mental substance (the\nimmaterial mind). By contrast, for analytical behaviorism, the belief\nthat I have as I arrive on time for a 2pm dental appointment, namely,\nthat I have a 2pm appointment, is not the property of a mental\nsubstance. Believing is a family of tendencies of my body. In\naddition, for an analytical behaviorist, we cannot identify the belief\nabout my arrival independently of that arrival or other members of\nthis family of tendencies. So, we also cannot treat it as the cause of\nthe arrival. Cause and effect are, as Hume taught, conceptually\ndistinct existences. Believing that I have a 2pm appointment is not\ndistinct from my arrival and so cannot be part of the causal\nfoundations of arrival.\n\nPsychological behaviorism\u2019s historical roots consist, in part,\nin the classical associationism of the British Empiricists, foremost\nJohn Locke (1632\u20131704) and David Hume (1711\u201376). According\nto classical associationism, intelligent behavior is the product of\nassociative learning. As a result of associations or pairings between\nperceptual experiences or stimulations on the one hand, and ideas or\nthoughts on the other, persons and animals acquire knowledge of their\nenvironment and how to act. Associations enable creatures to discover\nthe causal structure of the world. Association is most helpfully\nviewed as the acquisition of knowledge about relations between events.\nIntelligence in behavior is a mark of such knowledge.\n\nClassical associationism relied on introspectible entities, such as\nperceptual experiences or stimulations as the first links in\nassociations, and thoughts or ideas as the second links. Psychological\nbehaviorism, motivated by experimental interests, claims that to\nunderstand the origins of behavior, reference to stimulations\n(experiences) should be replaced by reference to stimuli (physical\nevents in the environment), and that reference to thoughts or ideas\nshould be eliminated or displaced in favor of reference to responses\n(overt behavior, motor movement). Psychological behaviorism is\nassociationism without appeal to inner mental events.\n\nDon\u2019t human beings talk of introspectible entities, thoughts,\nfeelings, and so on, even if these are not recognized by behaviorism\nor best understood as behavioral tendencies? Psychological\nbehaviorists regard the practice of talking about one\u2019s own\nstates of mind, and of introspectively reporting those states, as\npotentially useful data in psychological experiments, but as not\npresupposing the metaphysical subjectivity or non-physical presence of\nthose states. There are different sorts of causes behind introspective\nreports, and psychological behaviorists take these and other elements\nof introspection to be amenable to behavioral analysis. (For\nadditional discussion, see Section 5 of this entry). (See, for\ncomparison, Dennett\u2019s method of heterophenomenology; Dennett\n1991, pp. 72\u201381)\n\nThe task of psychological behaviorism is to specify types of\nassociation, understand how environmental events control behavior,\ndiscover and elucidate causal regularities or laws or functional\nrelations which govern the formation of associations, and predict how\nbehavior will change as the environment changes. The word\n\u201cconditioning\u201d is commonly used to specify the process\ninvolved in acquiring new associations. Animals in so-called\n\u201coperant\u201d conditioning experiments are not learning to,\nfor example, press levers. Instead, they are learning about the\nrelationship between events in their environment, for example, that a\nparticular behavior, pressing the lever in the presences of a light,\ncauses food to appear.\n\nIn its historical foundations, methodological behaviorism shares with\nanalytical behaviorism the influence of positivism. One of the main\ngoals of positivism was to unify psychology with natural science.\nWatson wrote that \u201cpsychology as a behaviorist views it is a\npurely objective experimental branch of natural science. Its\ntheoretical goal is \u2026 prediction and control\u201d (1913, p.\n158). Watson also wrote of the purpose of psychology as follows:\n\u201cTo predict, given the stimulus, what reaction will take place;\nor, given the reaction, state what the situation or stimulus is that\nhas caused the reaction\u201d (1930, p. 11).\n\nThough logically distinct, methodological, psychological, and\nanalytical behaviorisms are sometimes found in one behaviorism.\nSkinner\u2019s radical behaviorism combines all three forms of\nbehaviorism. It follows analytical strictures (at least loosely) in\nparaphrasing mental terms behaviorally, when or if they cannot be\neliminated from explanatory discourse. In Verbal Behavior (1957) and\nelsewhere, Skinner tries to show how mental terms can be given\nbehavioral interpretations. In About Behaviorism (1974) he says that\nwhen mental terminology cannot be eliminated it can be\n\u201ctranslated into behavior\u201d (p. 18, Skinner brackets the\nexpression with his own double quotes).\n\nRadical behaviorism is concerned with the behavior of organisms, not\nwith internal processing (if treated or described differently from\novert behavior). So, it is a form of methodological behaviorism.\nFinally, radical behaviorism understands behavior as a reflection of\nfrequency effects among stimuli, which means that it is a form of\npsychological behaviorism.\n",
