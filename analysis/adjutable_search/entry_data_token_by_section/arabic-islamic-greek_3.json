The translations of Hunayn ibn Ishaq, his son Ishaq and their associates: the complete Aristotelian corpus and Alexander of Aphrodisias\u2019s universe\n\nAnother group of translators takes the floor a bit later: the one of\nthe Nestorian physician and scientist Hunayn ibn Ishaq (d. 873)\n(Bergstr\u00e4sser 1913, 1925; Gabrieli 1924; Meyerhof 1926a, 1926b;\nHaddad 1974; Strohmaier 1990) his son Ishaq ibn Hunayn (d. 911), and\ntheir associates. In addition to the medical corpus of\n Galen,[50]\n this group of translators made available in Syriac and/or in Arabic\nother works by Plato, Aristotle, Theophrastus, some philosophical\nwritings by Galen, as well as works by Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nPorphyry, perhaps Iamblichus, Themistius, Proclus, and John\nPhiloponus.\n\nPlato. The Arabic translation of the Timaeus\nmade by Ibn al-Bitriq within the circle of al-Kindi was either\ncorrected by Hunayn ibn Ishaq, or superseded by the latter\u2019s\n translation.[51]\n The Laws were also translated by\n Hunayn,[52]\n but neither translation has come down to us. Hunayn ibn Ishaq is\ncredited also with an exegesis of the\n Republic.[53]\n To his son Ishaq is attributed the translation of a dialogue which\nmight be the Sophist, together with a commentary, possibly by\n Olympiodorus.[54]\n\nAristotle. The K. al-Fihrist credits Hunayn\nibn Ishaq with the translation of the\n Categories.[55]\n Hunayn also translated the De Interpretatione into Syriac\nand Ishaq made the Arabic translation of\n it.[56]\n The Prior Analytics were translated into Syriac partly by\nHunayn and partly by Ishaq, and into Arabic by a certain\n Tayadurus.[57]\n The Posterior Analytics were translated into Syriac, partly\nby Hunayn and in their entirety by\n Ishaq.[58]\n The latter also made a Syriac translation of the\n Topics,[59]\n but the translation which has come down to us is the Arabic one, made\nby Abu \u02bfUthman\n al-Dimashqi[60]\n (books I\u2013VII) and by Ibrahim ibn \u02bfAbdallah (book\n VIII).[61]\n The K. al-Fihrist tentatively attributes to Ishaq a\ntranslation of the\n Rhetoric,[62]\n but the extant anonymous Arabic version does not bear the features of\nthe translations of this period and has been ascribed to an earlier\n stage.[63]\n Ishaq also translated the Physics into\n Arabic.[64]\n As for the De Caelo, the K. al-Fihrist mentions a\nrevision made by Hunayn on Ibn al-Bitriq\u2019s\n version.[65]\n Hunayn is also the author of a compendium of the\nMeteorologica (Daiber 1975). The De Generatione et\ncorruptione was translated into Syriac by Hunayn and into Arabic\nby Ishaq; two other translations are mentioned, by Abu \u02bfUthman\nal-Dimashqi and Ibn\n Bakkus.[66]\n All the translations mentioned are lost, although not without having\nleft some\n traces.[67]\n As for the De Anima, in the K. al-Fihrist we are\ntold that Hunayn translated it into Syriac in its entirety, and that\nIshaq made another partial translation, plus a complete translation\ninto\n Arabic.[68]\n Ishaq ibn Hunayn also retranslated (or revised) the\n Metaphysics.[69]\n He is also credited with the translation into Arabic of the\nNicomachean\n Ethics.[70]\n In addition to the genuine Aristotelian works, some spuria were also\ntranslated by Hunayn and his associates: Hunayn himself possibly\ntranslated the Problemata Physica (Filius 2003,\n593\u201398); also the compilation of the so-called De\nLapidibus has been ascribed to him (Zonta 2003, 652\u201354).\nIshaq ibn Hunayn made the Arabic version of the De Plantis\n(Drossaart Lulofs-Poortman 1989; Hugonnard-Roche 2003b,\n499\u2013505), and Abu \u02bfUthman al-Dimashqi is credited with the\ntranslation of the De Virtutibus et\n vitiis.[71]\n\nTheophrastus. The translation of the\nMetaphysics is attributed to Ishaq ibn Hunayn in one of the\nextant manuscripts, and linguistic analysis confirms this authorship,\neven though the K. al-Fihrist attributes the translation to\nYahya ibn\n \u02bfAdi.[72]\n\nNicolaus Damascenus. His compilation On the\nPhilosophy of Aristotle was translated into Syriac by Hunayn ibn\nIshaq: the extant fragments from the first five books are extant and\n edited.[73]\n The commentary on the De Plantis too was translated by\nHunayn ibn Ishaq (Drossaart-Lulofs 1965, 16).\n\nGalen. The compendium of Plato\u2019s\nTimaeus has been translated into Syriac by Hunayn ibn Ishaq\nand from Syriac into Arabic by Hunayn\u2019s pupil \u02bfIsa ibn\nYahya ibn Ibrahim: the Arabic text has come down to us and forms\nvolume I of the Plato\n Arabus.[74]\n\nAlexander of Aphrodisias. (i) Commentaries. The\ncommentary by Alexander on Book Lambda of the\nMetaphysics, lost in Greek together with the rest of\nAlexander\u2019s commentary beyond book Delta, is said to\nhave been translated into Syriac by Hunayn ibn\n Ishaq.[75]\n The Arabic translation, based in all likelihood on this Syriac\nversion, is lost, but several extracts of it survive in\nAverroes\u2019 commentary on the Metaphysics (Freudenthal\n1885; Bouyges 1952, clxxviii-clxxix). (ii) Personal works. Hunayn ibn\nIshaq translated Qu. III 3 on sense-perception (Ruland 1978),\nand his son Ishaq in all likelihood is the translator of\nAlexander\u2019s De\n Anima.[76]\n Two Arabic translations of the treatise On the Principles of the\n All[77]\n have come down to us: one by Ishaq ibn\n Hunayn[78]\n and the other by Abu \u02bfUthman al-Dimashqi (Genequand 2001,\n31\u20139; Genequand 2017, 14\u201316). Even more important for the\nsubsequent developments of falsafa was Ishaq\u2019s Arabic\ntranslation of the short treatise On Intellect (see Finnegan\n1956; Badawi 1971, 31\u201342; Goulet-Aouad 1989, 134; Geoffroy\n2002).\n\nPorphyry. The Isagoge, already known to some\nextent through a compendium of Aristotelian logic ascribed to Ibn\nal-Muqaffa\u02bf, was translated by Abu \u02bfUthman\n al-Dimashqi.[79]\n This is the only writing by Porphyry whose Arabic translation is\nextant; other translations are mentioned in the bio-bibliographical\nsources or otherwise attested by Arab authors. These sources mention\nan Introduction to the Categorical Syllogisms translated by\nAbu \u02bfUthman\n al-Dimashqi.[80]\n A commentary on the Categories is recorded in the K.\n al-Fihrist[81]\n and served as a source for Ibn\n Suwar\u2019s[82]\n \u201cedition\u201d of Hunayn\u2019s translation of the\nCategories (Elamrani Jamal 1989, 511). A commentary on the\nPhysics, lost in Greek, is also\n mentioned.[83]\n A translation of the commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics,\nlost in Greek, is attributed to Ishaq ibn\n Hunayn.[84]\n\nIamblichus. The anonymous translation of a commentary\non Pythagoras\u2019 Golden Verses attributed to Iamblichus\npossibly belongs to this\n period.[85]\n\n\nThemistius. Ishaq\u2019s Arabic translation of the\nparaphrasis of the De Anima, mentioned in the\nbio-bibliographical\n sources,[86]\n is extant and edited (Lyons 1973; see also Browne 1986, 1998 and the\noverview by Elamrani Jamal 2003, 352\u201353). The Arabic translation\nof a Letter by Themistius On Government is\nattributed to Abu \u02bfUthman al-Dimashqi (Gutas 1975, 47).\n\nNemesius of Emesa. The De Natura hominis was\ntranslated into Arabic either by Ishaq or by his father Hunayn (see\nSamir 1986, Zonta 1991, Chase 2005).\n\nProclus. Ishaq retranslated the Eighteen\nArguments on the Eternity of the Cosmos against the\n Christians.[87]\n\nJohn Philoponus. Even though there are no compelling\nreasons to ascribe it to the milieu of Hunayn, the translation of\nPhiloponus\u2019 treatise Against Aristotle on the Eternity of\nthe\n World[88]\n might trace back to this\n period.[89]\n\nOlympiodorus. A paraphrasis of the\nMeteorologica translated by Hunayn ibn Ishaq and corrected by\nhis son Ishaq (Badawi 1971, 13) has been discovered and edited by\n\u02bfA. Badawi (Badawi 1971, 95\u2013190). The text, however, is\nvery different from the one preserved in Greek (Schoonheim 2003,\n326).\n\nTogether with the translations of the Galenic corpus, Hunayn, Ishaq\nand other translators associated with them put at the disposal of\nlearned Muslims the Aristotelian corpus in its entirety. This\nenterprise paved the way to the understanding of Aristotle\u2019s\nthought as a systematic whole based on the theory of demonstrative\nscience and crowned by the Metaphysics, an understanding\nwhich is apparent both in al-Farabi and in\n Avicenna.[90]\n The translation of Alexander\u2019s treatises On the Principles\nof the All and On Intellect helped to shape the\nmetaphysical cosmology and noetics of Medieval Arabic philosophy. A\nhierarchy of separate, intellectual substances is seen as striving\ntowards Aristotle\u2019s Unmoved Mover, also called the \u201cTrue\nOne\u201d by both al-Farabi and Avicenna, in a purely Neoplatonic and\nKindian vein. In doing so, these separate substances imitate the\nmotionless causality of the First Principle by their eternal circular\nmovement (Pines 1986; Martini Bonadeo 2004). This warrants the\nregularity of the laws of nature in the sublunar world. The Agent\nIntellect also belongs to this hierarchy of separate substances: the\n\u201clight\u201d shed by the Agent Intellect is seen as the\ncondition for the intellect that is a faculty of the human soul,\nnamely the potential intellect, to actually know the intelligibles\n(Walzer 1970).\n\nIn texts in which al-Farabi lays down his program for philosophical\neducation, such as the Enumeration of the Sciences, he\nexplains that metaphysics has three parts. The first one studies\nbeings qua beings; the second studies the principles of the\ntheoretical sciences, such as logic and mathematics; the third studies\nbeings that are neither bodies nor in bodies and discovers that they\nform a hierarchy leading to the First or One, which gives existence,\nunity, and truth to all other beings. It also shows how all other\nbeings proceed from the One. (\u2026) The presentation of the third\npart shows that al-Farabi has abandoned al-Kindi\u2019s view of the\nOne as beyond being and intellect, and that he equates some features\nof Aristotle\u2019s Prime Mover who is an Intellect with those of the\nNeoplatonic One. He also distinguishes the First or God from the agent\nintellect. As the First knows only itself, emanation is necessary and\neternally gives rise to the world. Al-Farabi intends to tidy up all\nthe unresolved questions of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics and\nto develop a theological teaching. (Druart 2005, 334)\n\n",
