    "main_text": "Three Approaches to the Justification of Rights\n6. Three Approaches to the Justification of Rights\n\nThere are two leading philosophical approaches to explaining which\nfundamental rights of conduct there are, and why these rights should\nbe respected. These two approaches are broadly identifiable as\ndeontological and consequentialist. Status theories hold that human\nbeings have attributes that make it fitting to ascribe certain rights\nto them, and make respect for these rights appropriate. Instrumental\ntheories hold that respect for particular rights is a means for\nbringing about some optimal distribution of advantages. Each approach\nhas characteristic strengths and weaknesses; the long-running contest\nbetween them is ongoing.\n\nQuinn (1993, 170) sketches a modern status theory this way:\n\n\nA person is constituted by his body and his mind. They are parts or\naspects of him. For that very reason, it is fitting that he have\nprimary say over what may be done to them\u2014not because such an\narrangement best promotes overall human welfare, but because any\narrangement that denied him that say would be a grave indignity. In\ngiving him this authority, morality recognizes his existence as an\nindividual with ends of his own\u2014an independent being.\nSince that is what he is, he deserves this recognition.\n\n\nQuinn claims that there is some attribute of the person\u2014here,\nbeing \u201can individual with ends of his own\u201d\u2014that\nmerits recognition from others. The recognition that is due to each\nindividual can be accorded to that individual by respecting his\nfundamental rights.\n\nQuinn contrasts his status approach to rights with one that ascribes\nrights \u201cbecause such an arrangement best promotes overall human\nwelfare.\u201d His target is consequentialist theories of rights, the\nparadigm of which are utilitarian theories. We met such a utilitarian\ntheory of rights above in John Stuart Mill\u2019s conceptualization\nof rights as \u201csomething which society ought to defend me in the\npossession of.\u201d Mill believed that society ought to defend the\nindividual in possession of her rights because doing so would bring\nabout the greatest utility summed across the members of that society.\nFor Mill, as for other instrumental theorists, rights are a tool for\nproducing an optimal distribution of interests across some group.\n\nThe two approaches differ sharply over the role of consequences in the\njustification of ascribing rights. Status theorists hold that rights\nshould be respected because it is fitting to do so, and not because of\nthe good consequences that will flow from so doing. By contrast,\nwithin an instrumental theory good consequences are the justification\nfor promulgating and enforcing rights. As Quinn (1993, 173) says about\nthe status approach:\n\n\nIt is not that we think it fitting to ascribe rights because we think\nit is a good thing that rights be respected. Rather we think respect\nfor rights a good thing precisely because we think people actually\nhave them\u2014and\u2026 that they have them because it is fitting\nthat they should.\n\n\nWithin a status approach, rights are not means for the promotion of\ngood consequences. They are rather, in Nozick\u2019s phrase, side\nconstraints on the pursuit of good consequences (Nozick 1974,\n29). A status approach frowns on any rights violation, even for the\nsake of maximizing the non-violation of rights overall (as in a\n\u201cutilitarianism of rights\u201d). Such an approach emphasizes\nthe \u201cagent-relative\u201d reasons that each person has to avoid\nviolating the rights of others.\n\nA status-based justification thus begins with the nature of the\nrightholder and arrives immediately at the right. The instrumental\napproach starts with the desired consequences (like maximum utility)\nand works backward to see which rights-ascriptions will produce those\nconsequences.\n",
