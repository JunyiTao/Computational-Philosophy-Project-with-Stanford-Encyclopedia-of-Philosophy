Methodology I: the optics debates of the 1670s\n\nPhilosophers have long known about the aspects of Newton\u2019s work\nthat are salient for understanding debates in the early modern period.\nFor instance, no history of debates about the ontology of space and\ntime would exclude a discussion of Newton\u2019s famous conception of\n\u201cabsolute\u201d space (see below). Similarly, any discussion of\nthe role of hypotheses in philosophical reasoning would mention Newton\nprominently. These aspects of Newton\u2019s work continue to be\nsignificant in contemporary scholarship, but the scope of discussions\nof Newton has greatly expanded, encompassing the whole of his\nintellectual life. This is especially evident in discussions of\nNewton\u2019s earliest published work, which was in the field of\noptics. In at least three relevant respects, Newton\u2019s early work\nin optics, which was published in the Philosophical\nTransactions of the Royal Society beginning in 1672, set the\nstage for the principal themes of his long career in natural\nphilosophy (he remained active well into his seventies). Firstly,\nNewton\u2019s letter to the Society\u2019s secretary, Henry\nOldenburg, often called the \u201cNew theory about light and\ncolors\u201d, generated an immediate, extensive, and protracted\ndebate that eventually involved important philosophers such as Robert\nHooke in Britain and Christiaan Huygens, G.W. Leibniz and Ignatius\nPardies on the Continent (the beginning of the very long title of the\npaper is: \u201cA letter of Mr. Isaac Newton, Mathematick Professor\nin the University of Cambridge, containing his New Theory about Light\nand Colors\u201d). Newton consistently regarded these figures not\nmerely as disagreeing with his views, but as misinterpreting them.\nThis experience helped to shape Newton\u2019s famous and lifelong\naversion to intellectual controversy, a feature of his personality\nthat he often mentioned in letters, and one that he would never\noutgrow. Secondly, because Newton regarded himself as having been\ndeeply misinterpreted by his critics, he had recourse to meta-level or\nmethodological discussions of the practice of optics and of the kinds\nof knowledge that philosophers can obtain when engaging in experiments\nwith light. The novelty and power of Newton\u2019s work in the\nPrincipia years later would eventually generate similar\ncontroversies that led him to analogous kinds of methodological\ndiscussions of his experimental practice within natural philosophy and\nof the kinds of knowledge that one can obtain in that field using\neither experimental or mathematical techniques. From our\npoint of view, Newton\u2019s science was unusually philosophical for\nthese reasons. Thirdly and finally, in his earliest optical work\nNewton began to formulate a distinction that would remain salient\nthroughout his long intellectual career, contending that a philosopher\nmust distinguish between a conclusion or claim about some feature of\nnature that is derived from experimental or observational evidence,\nand a conclusion or claim that is a mere \u201chypothesis\u201d, a\nkind of speculation about nature that is not, or not yet anyway, so\nderived. Newton\u2019s much later proclamation in the second edition\nof the Principia (1713), \u201cHypotheses non\nfingo\u201d, or \u201cI feign no hypotheses\u201d, would\ninfuriate his critics just as much as it would prod his followers into\nmaking the pronouncement a central component of a newly emerging\nNewtonian method (see below for details).\n\nThe field of optics has its origins in the Ancient Greek period, when\nfigures like Euclid and Ptolemy wrote works on the subject, but they\noften focused primarily on the science of vision, analyzing (e.g.) the\nvisual rays that were sometimes thought to extrude from the eye,\nenabling it to perceive distant physical objects. In the early modern\nperiod, Kepler and Descartes each made fundamental contributions to\nthe field, including the discovery of the inversion of the retinal\nimage (in the former case) and an explanation of refraction (in the\nlatter case). Newton\u2019s work helped to shift the focus of optics\nfrom an analysis of vision to an investigation of light. In \u201cNew\ntheory about light and colors\u201d, published in the\nPhilosophical Transactions in 1672, Newton presented a number\nof experiments in which sunlight was allowed to pass through one or\ntwo prisms in order to probe some of its basic features. The paper\nrecounts a number of experiments that Newton says he had conducted\nseveral years earlier. But what precisely counts as a feature\nof light? Numerous philosophers during the seventeenth century,\nincluding Hooke and Huygens, developed doctrines concerning the\nfundamental physical nature of light in answer to the question: is\nlight a stream of particles (or \u201ccorpuscles\u201d), or a wave?\nBoth Hooke and Huygens were wave theorists. This question obviously\ncontinued to have relevance into the twentieth century, when\nwave-particle duality was discovered. In his experiments with the\nprism, however, Newton apparently sought to investigate something\nelse, viz. what he calls \u201cthe celebrated Phenomena of\nColours\u201d. Newton\u2019s various prism experiments, which\nhe describes in considerable depth, suggested what he called a\n\u201cDoctrine\u201d that he expresses in thirteen consecutive\nnumbered propositions. Included in these propositions are the\nfollowing claims about features of rays of light: first, the rays of\nlight that emerge when sunlight passes through a prism exhibit various\ncolors; second, these colors differ in their \u201cdegrees of\nRefrangibility\u201d, which means that they exhibit and retain an\nindex of refraction, even when they are passed through a second prism;\nthird, these colors\u2014or colorful rays\u2014are not modifications\nof sunlight itself, but are \u201cOriginal and connate\nproperties\u201d of it; and, fourth, these facts mean that\nalthough ordinary sunlight appears white, or perhaps colorless, to our\nperception, it actually contains numerous colors within it, which can\nbe experimentally revealed. This final point suggests, in turn, that\nfrom Newton\u2019s point of view, colors are not solely perceived, or\neven perceptible, aspects of physical objects; they can also be\nconceived of as hidden features of light which cannot be perceived\ndirectly under any ordinary circumstance (the physical influence of\nthe prism is required for them to become perceptible).\n\nFrom a contemporary point of view, Newton\u2019s 1672 paper exhibits\nan intriguing blend of experimental evidence and philosophical\nargumentation. The latter hinges on Newton\u2019s interpretation of\nthe concept of a property or a quality, as the following passage,\nwhich follows the \u201cDoctrine\u201d expressed in thirteen\npropositions, tellingly reveals:\n\n\nThese things being so, it can be no longer disputed, whether there be\ncolours in the dark, nor whether they be the qualities of the objects\nwe see, no nor perhaps, whether Light be a Body. For, since Colours\nare the qualities of Light, having its Rays for their entire\nand immediate subject, how can we think those Rays qualities\nalso, unless one quality may be the subject of and sustain another;\nwhich in effect is to call it substance. We should not know\nBodies for substances, were it not for their sensible qualities, and\nthe Principal of those being now found due to something else, we have\nas good reason to believe that to be a substance also. (Newton\n1959\u2013, vol. 1: 100)\n\n\nNewton seems here to be arguing as follows: since rays of light have\ncolors as basic features, we should regard these colors as qualities\nor properties of the rays (despite the fact that these properties are\nimperceptible under any ordinary circumstance); but doing so requires\nus to think of the rays as bearers of qualities, which is to say, as\nsubstances in their own right. And if rays of light are substances,\nthis means that we cannot also think of them as qualities or\nproperties of anything else. This last point follows from a widely\naccepted notion of a substance at the time, one easily found in\n Descartes[7],\n viz., that substances are those items that can exist independently of\nother items (whether they can exist independently even of God is a\nfurther question that we can ignore here). And if we cannot think of\nrays of light as properties or qualities, then they are not waves, for\nwaves are features of some medium\u2014think of waves on the surface\nof a lake. Newton concludes: light is a stream of particles (he does\nuse the word \u2018perhaps\u2019 to hedge a bit here). Clearly,\nphilosophical argumentation is a significant aspect of Newton\u2019s\nreasoning in this paper, as are various philosophical concepts. It is\nintriguing to ponder the question, what overall conception of\n\u201csensible qualities\u201d does Newton presuppose in this piece?\nIf a ray of sunlight passes through my window, the fact that it\nappears white to me does not undermine Newton\u2019s view (or so he\nthinks) that the ray actually contains a series of colors as its\n\u201cqualities\u201d. Are these qualities \u201csensible\u201d if\ntheir presence can be detected only through the use of one or more\nprisms but never through the inspection of the sunlight through\nordinary means (unaided perception, glasses, a magnifying glass,\netc.)? These are apt to strike us as canonical philosophical\nproblems.\n\nNewton\u2019s line of argument quoted above became one of the\ncenterpieces of the debate that his paper generated. In some parts of\nhis paper, when Newton wrote of the \u201crays\u201d of light, he\nhad evidently intended to remain neutral on the question of whether\nthe rays are particles or waves (this is reminiscent of the ancient\nGreek practice of avoiding physical discussions of visual rays). But\nthen towards the paper\u2019s end, Newton added his new line of\nargument, which employed some philosophical analysis together with\nsome experimental evidence to support the conclusion that rays of\nlight cannot be waves after all. Newton\u2019s critics pounced. This\nled to the first problem he encountered in response to his paper: what\nhe calls his \u201ctheory\u201d of light and colors was not merely\nrejected, but rather immediately misunderstood, at least from his own\nperspective. Just days after Newton\u2019s paper was read at the\nRoyal Society, Robert Hooke responded with a detailed letter to\nOldenburg. In the first few sentences, Hooke indicates that from his\npoint of view, Newton\u2019s \u201cHypothesis of saving the\nphenomena of colours\u201d essentially involves the contention that\nrays of light are particulate, rather than\n wavelike.[8]\n Hooke argues, in contrast, that light \u201cis nothing but a pulse\nor motion propagated through an homogeneous, uniform and transparent\nmedium;\u201d that is, he argues that light is indeed wavelike. He\nmakes it perfectly clear, moreover, that his hypothesis\u2014the name\ndid not carry a negative connotation in his work\u2014can save the\nphenomena of colors just as well as Newton\u2019s, which is to say,\nhis hypothesis is compatible with the experimental evidence Newton had\ngathered. Evidently, the line of argument in the passage quoted above\ncaught Hooke\u2019s eye. Among philosophers, he was not alone. In a\nletter to Huygens explaining Newton\u2019s theory of light, Leibniz\nwrites that Newton takes light to be a \u201cbody\u201d propelled\nfrom the sun to the earth which, according to Leibniz, Newton takes to\nexplain both the differential refrangibility of rays of light and the\nphenomena of\n colors.[9]\n Since Newton had employed the concepts of substance, quality and\nsensible quality when concluding in his paper that light is\n(presumably) particulate, we are apt to regard the paper as\ncontributing to important discussions within philosophy. After the\nextensive correspondence, and controversy, generated in response to\nNewton\u2019s early optical views and experiments, he often\nthreatened to avoid engaging in mathematical and philosophical\ndisputes altogether. He insisted to friends and colleagues that he\nfound intellectual controversy unbearable. But he never followed\nthrough with his threat to disengage from discussions in natural\nphilosophy, sending many important letters throughout his long\nintellectual career.\n",
