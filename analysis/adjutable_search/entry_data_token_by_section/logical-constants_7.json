    "main_text": "Inferential characterizations || Sense determination\n6.2 Sense determination\n\n\nThe idea that introduction and/or elimination rules fix the\nsense of a logical constant is often motivated by talk of the\nrules as defining the constant.  Gentzen remarks that the natural\ndeduction rules \u201crepresent, as it were, the\n\u2018definitions\u2019 of the symbols concerned, and the eliminations are no\nmore, in the final analysis, than the consequences of these definitions\u201d\n(1935, \u00a75.13; 1969, 80).\nHowever, a genuine definition would permit the constant to be\neliminated from every context in which it occurs (see the entry\non Definitions), and introduction and\nelimination rules for logical constants do not, in general, permit\nthis. For example, in an intuitionistic sequent calculus, there is no\nsequent (or group of sequents) not containing \\(\\dq{\\rightarrow}\\)\nthat is equivalent to the sequent \\(\\dq{A \\rightarrow B \\vdash C}\\).\nFor this reason, Kneale\n(1956, 257) says only that we can \u201ctreat\u201d the rules as definitions,\nHacking (1979) speaks of the rules \u201cnot as defining but only as characterizing\nthe logical constants,\u201d and Do\u0161en (1994) says that the rules\nprovide only an \u201canalysis,\u201d not a\n definition.[23]\n\n\nHowever, even if the rules are not \u201cdefinitions,\u201d there may still be\nsomething to say for the claim that they \u201cfix the senses\u201d of the\nconstants they introduce. For it may be that a speaker\u2019s grasp of the\nmeaning of the constants consists in her mastery of these rules: her\ndisposition to accept inferences conforming to the rules as\n\u201cprimitively compelling\u201d (Peacocke 1987, Hodes 2004). (A speaker finds\nan inference form primitively compelling just in case she finds it\ncompelling and does not take its correctness to require external\nratification, e.g. by inference.) If the senses of logical constants\nare individuated in this way by the conditions for their grasp, we can\ndistinguish between truth-functionally equivalent constants with\ndifferent meanings, like\n\\(\\dq{\\vee}\\), \\(\\dq{\\ddagger}\\), and \\(\\dq{\\dagger}\\),\nas defined below:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA \\vee B & \\quad A~\\text{or}~B\\\\\nA \\ddagger B &  \\quad \\text{not both not}~A~\\text{and not}~B\\\\\nA \\dagger B &  \\quad (A~\\text{or}~B)~\\text{and no widows are male}\n\\end{align*}\n\n\n\nTo understand \\(\\dq{\\vee}\\) one must find\nthe standard introduction rules primitively\ncompelling:\n\n\\[\\label{or-intro}\n\\frac{A}{A \\vee B}\n\\quad\n\\frac{B}{A \\vee B}\n\\]\n\n\n\nTo understand \\(\\dq{\\ddagger}\\) one must find the\nfollowing elimination rule primitively compelling:\n\n\\[\\label{ddagger-elim}\n\\frac{\\neg A, \\neg B, A \\ddagger B}{C}\n\\]\n\n\n\nFinally, to grasp the sense of \\(\\dq{\\dagger}\\) one must find these\nintroduction rules primitively compelling:\n\n\\[\\label{dagger-intro}\n\\frac{A, \\text{no widows are male}}{A \\dagger B}\n\\quad\n\\frac{B, \\text{no widows are male}}{A \\dagger B}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\\(\\dq{\\vee}\\) and \\(\\dq{\\ddagger}\\) will count as\nlogical constants, because their sense-constitutive rules are purely\ninferential, while \\(\\dq{\\dagger}\\) will not, because its rules are not.\n(In the same way we can distinguish \\(\\dq{\\exists}\\) from\n\\(\\dq{W}\\).) Note that appropriately rewritten versions of \\(\\refp{or-intro}\\)\nwill hold for \\(\\dq{\\ddagger}\\) and \\(\\dq{\\dagger}\\); the difference is\nthat one can grasp \\(\\dq{\\ddagger}\\) and \\(\\dq{\\dagger}\\) (but not\n\\(\\dq{\\vee}\\)) without finding these rules primitively\ncompelling (Peacocke 1987, 156; cp. Sainsbury 2001, 370\u20131).\n\n\nSome critics have doubted that the introduction and elimination\nrules for the logical constants exhaust the aspects of the use of these\nconstants that must be mastered if one is to understand them. For\nexample, it has been suggested that in order to grasp the conditional\nand the universal quantifier, one must be disposed to treat certain\nkinds of inductive evidence as grounds for the assertion of\nconditionals and universally quantified claims (Dummett 1991, 275\u20138;\nG\u00f3mez-Torrente 2002, 26\u20137; Sainsbury 2001, 370\u20131). It is not\nclear that these additional aspects of use can be captured in \u201cpurely\ninferential\u201d rules, or that they can be derived from aspects of use\nthat can be so captured.\n\n\nIt is sometimes thought that Prior\u2019s (1960) example of a\nconnective \u201ctonk,\u201d\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A}{A~\\text{tonk}~B} \\quad \\frac{A~\\text{tonk}~B}{B}\n\\]\n\n\nwhose rules permit\ninferring anything from anything, decisively refutes\nthe idea that the senses of logical constants are fixed\nby their introduction and/or elimination rules. But although\nPrior\u2019s example\n(anticipated in Popper 1946\u20137, 284) certainly shows that not all sets of\nintroduction and elimination rules determine a coherent meaning for a\nlogical constant, it does not show that none do,\nor that the logical constants are\nnot distinctive in having their meanings determined in this way.\nFor some attempts to articulate conditions under\nwhich introduction and elimination rules do fix a meaning, see Belnap\n(1962), Hacking (1979, 296\u20138), Kremer (1988, 62\u20136),\nand Hodes (2004, 156\u20137).\n\nPrawitz (1985; 2005) argues that\n any formally suitable introduction rule can fix the meaning for a\nlogical constant. On Prawitz\u2019s view, the lesson we learn from Prior is that we cannot\nalso stipulate an elimination rule, but must\njustify any proposed elimination rule by showing that there is a procedure\nfor rearranging any direct proof of the premises\nof the elimination rule into a direct proof of the conclusion.\nThus, we can stipulate\nthe introduction rule for \u201ctonk\u201d, but must then\ncontent ourselves with the strongest elimination rule for which such a procedure\nis available:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A~\\text{tonk}~B}{A}.\n\\]\n\n\nOther philosophers reject Prawitz's (and Gentzen's) view that the introduction\nrules have priority in fixing the meanings of constants, but\nretain the idea that the introduction and elimination rules that fix the meaning of\na constant must be in harmony:\nthe elimination rules must not permit us to infer more from a compound sentence\nthan would be justified by the premises of the corresponding introduction rules\n(Dummett 1981, 396; Tennant 1987, 76-98).\n(For analyses of various notions of harmony, and their relation to notions like\nnormalizability and conservativeness, see Milne 1994, Read 2010, and Steinberger 2011.)\n\n",
