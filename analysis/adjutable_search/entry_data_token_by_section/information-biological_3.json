    "main_text": "The genetic code\n4. The genetic code\nSo far we have mostly discussed the concept of information; there\nhas not been much talk of \u201ccoding\u201d. With the exception of\nour discussion of Bergstrom and Rosvall\u2019s \u201ctransmission\nsense\u201d of information, the discussion so far has not emphasised\nthe distinctive features of the cell-level processes in which genes\nfigure, such as the language-like combinatorial structure of the\n\u201cgenetic code\u201d. These structural features of DNA and its\nrelation to amino acids are not central to some of the ideas about\ninformation in biology, even when the focus is on development and\ninheritance. As noted above, the enthusiasm for semantic\ncharacterization of biological structures extends back before the\ngenetic code was discovered (see Kay 2000 for a detailed historical\ntreatment). But one line of thought in the literature, overlapping\nwith the ideas above, has focused on the special features of genetic\nmechanisms, and on the idea of \u201cgenetic coding\u201d as a\ncontingent feature of these mechanisms.\nBoth Peter Godfrey-Smith and Paul Griffiths have argued that there\nis one highly restricted use of a fairly rich semantic notion within\ngenetics that is justified (Godfrey-Smith 2000; Griffiths 2001).  This\nis the idea that genes \u201ccode for\u201d the amino acid sequence\nof protein molecules, in virtue of the peculiar features of the\n\u201ctranscription and translation\u201d mechanisms found within\ncells. Genes specify amino acid sequence via a templating process that\ninvolves a regular mapping rule between two quite different kinds of\nmolecules (nucleic acid bases and amino acids). This mapping rule\nis combinatorial, and apparently arbitrary (in a\nsense that is hard to make precise, though see Stegmann 2004 for\ndiscussion of different versions of this idea).\nFigure 1 below has the standard genetic code\nsummarized. The three-letter abbreviations such as \u201cPhe\u201d\nand \u201cLeu\u201d are types of amino acid molecules.\n\n\nFigure 1. The Standard Genetic\nCode\n\nThis very narrow understanding of the informational properties of\ngenes is basically in accordance with the influential early proposal\nof Francis Crick (1958). The argument is that these low-level\nmechanistic features make gene expression into a causal process that\nhas significant analogies to paradigmatic symbolic phenomena.\nSome have argued that this analogy becomes questionable once we\nmove from the genetics of simple prokaryotic organisms (bacteria and\narchaea), to those in eukaryotic cells (Sarkar 1996). Mainstream\nbiology tends to regard the complications that arise in the case of\neukaryotes as mere details that do not compromise the basic picture we\nhave of how gene expression works (for an extensive discussion of\nthese complexities, by those who think they really matter, see\n(Griffiths and Stotz 2013)). An example is the editing and\n\u201csplicing\u201d of mRNA transcripts. The initial stage in gene\nexpression is the use of DNA in a template process to construct an\nintermediate molecule, mRNA or \u201cmessenger RNA\u201d, that is\nthen used as a template in the manufacture of a protein. The protein\nis made by stringing a number of amino acid molecules together. In\neukaryotes the mRNA is often extensively modified\n(\u201cedited\u201d) prior to its use. Moreover, much of the DNA in\na eukaryotic organism is not transcribed and translated at all. Some\nof this \u201cnon-coding\u201d DNA (note the informational language\nagain) is certainly functional, serving as binding sites for proteins\nthat bind to the DNA thus regulating the timing and rate of\ntranscription. The extent of wholly nonfunctional DNA remains\nunclear. These facts make eukaryotic DNA a much less straightforward\npredictor of the protein\u2019s amino acid sequence than it is in\nbacteria, but it can be argued that this does not much affect the\ncrucial features of gene expression mechanisms that motivate the\nintroduction of a symbolic or semantic mode of description.\nSo the argument in Godfrey-Smith (2000) and Griffiths (2001) is\nthat there is one kind of informational or semantic property that\ngenes and only genes have: coding for the amino acid sequences of\nprotein molecules. But this relation \u201creaches\u201d only as far\nas the amino acid sequence. It does not vindicate the idea that genes\ncode for whole-organism phenotypes, let alone provide a basis for the\nwholesale use of informational or semantic language in biology.  Genes\ncan have a reliable causal role in the production of a whole-organism\nphenotype, of course. But if this causal relation is to be described\nin informational terms, then it is a matter of ordinary Shannon\ninformation, which applies to environmental factors as well. That\nsaid, it is possible to argue that the specificity of gene action, and\nthe existence of an array of actual and possible alternatives at a\ngiven site on a chromosome, means that genes exert fine-grained causal\ncontrol over phenotypes, and that few other developmental resources\nexert this form of causal control (Waters\n2007; Maclaurin 1998;\nStegmann 2014). In contrast, Griffiths and Stotz\n(2013) say that these\nother factors are often a source of \u201cCrick information\u201d,\nas they contribute to specifying the linear sequence of a gene\nproduct.  We return to this issue in section\n6.\nOne of the most appealing, but potentially problematic, features of\nthe idea that genes code for amino acid sequences concerns the alleged\n\u201carbitrariness\u201d of the genetic code. The notion of\narbitrariness figures in other discussions of genetic information as\nwell (Maynard Smith 2000; Sarkar 2003; Stegmann 2004). It is common to\nsay that the standard genetic code has arbitrary features, as many\nother mappings between DNA base triplets and amino acids would be\nbiologically possible, if there were compensating changes in the\nmachinery by which \u201ctranslation\u201d of the genetic message is\nachieved. Francis Crick suggested that the structure of the genetic\ncode should be seen as a \u201cfrozen accident\u201d, one that was\ninitially highly contingent but is now very hard for evolution to\nchange (Crick 1958). But the very idea of arbitrariness, and the\nhypothesis of a frozen accident, have become problematic. For one\nthing, as noted in our discussion of Bergstrom and Rosvall (2011)\nabove, the code is not arbitrary in the sense that many others would\nwork as well. To the contrary, the existing code is near-optimal for\nminimising error costs. Conceptually, it seems that any causal\nrelation can look \u201carbitrary\u201d if it operates via many\nintervening links. There is nothing \u201carbitrary\u201d about the\nmechanisms by which each molecular binding event occurs. What makes\nthe code seem arbitrary is the fact that the mapping between base\ntriplets and amino acids is mediated by a causal chain with a number\nof intervening links (especially involving \u201ctransfer RNA\u201d\nmolecules, and enzymes that bind amino acids to these intervening\nmolecules). Because we often focus on the \u201clong-distance\u201d\nconnection between DNA and protein, the causal relation appears\narbitrary. If we focused on steps in any other biological cascade that\nare separated by three or four intervening links, the causal relation\nwould look just as \u201carbitrary\u201d. So the very idea of\narbitrariness is elusive. And empirically, the standard genetic code\nis turning out to have more systematic and non-accidental structure\nthan people had once supposed (Knight, Freeland, and Landweber\n1999). The notion of\narbitrariness has also been used in discussions of the links between\ngenes and phenotypes in a more general sense. Kirscher and Gerhart\n(2005) discuss a kind of arbitrariness that derives from the details\nof protein molecules and their relation to gene regulation. Proteins\nthat regulate gene action tend to have distinct binding sites, which\nevolution can change independently. To bind, a protein must be able to\nattach to a site, but that requires congruence only with a local\nfeature of the protein, not sharply constraining its overall shape\n(Planer 2014). This gives rise to a huge range of possible processes\nof gene regulation. So there is a perennial temptation to appeal to\nthe idea of arbitrariness when discussing the alleged informational\nnature of some biological causation.\n",
