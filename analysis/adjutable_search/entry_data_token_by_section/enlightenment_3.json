    "main_text": "The True: Science, Epistemology and Metaphysics in the Enlightenment || Skepticism in the Enlightenment\n1.3 Skepticism in the Enlightenment\n\nSkepticism enjoys a remarkably strong place in Enlightenment\nphilosophy, given that confidence in our intellectual capacities to\nachieve systematic knowledge of nature is a leading characteristic of\nthe age. This oddity is at least softened by the point that much\nskepticism in the Enlightenment is merely methodological, a tool meant\nto serve science, rather than a position embraced on its own account.\nThe instrumental role for skepticism is exemplified prominently in\nDescartes\u2019 Meditations on First Philosophy (1641), in\nwhich Descartes employs radical skeptical doubt to attack prejudices\nderived from learning and from sense experience and to search out\nprinciples known with certainty which may serve as a secure foundation\nfor a new system of knowledge. Given the negative, critical,\nsuspicious attitude of the Enlightenment towards doctrines\ntraditionally regarded as well founded, it is not surprising that\nEnlightenment thinkers employ skeptical tropes (drawn from the ancient\nskeptical tradition) to attack traditional dogmas in science,\nmetaphysics and religion.\n\nHowever, skepticism is not merely a methodological tool in the hands\nof Enlightenment thinkers. The skeptical cast of mind is one prominent\nmanifestation of the Enlightenment spirit. The influence of Pierre\nBayle, another founding figure of the Enlightenment, testifies to\nthis. Bayle was a French Protestant, who, like many European\nphilosophers of his time, was forced to live and work in politically\nliberal and tolerant Holland in order to avoid censorship and prison.\nBayle\u2019s Historical and Critical Dictionary (1697), a\nstrange and wonderful book, exerts great influence on the age. The\nform of the book is intimidating: a biographical dictionary, with long\nscholarly entries on obscure figures in the history of culture,\ninterrupted by long scholarly footnotes, which are in turn interrupted\nby further footnotes. Rarely has a work with such intimidating\nscholarly pretentions exerted such radical and liberating influence in\nthe culture. It exerts this influence through its skeptical\nquestioning of religious, metaphysical, and scientific dogmas.\nBayle\u2019s eclecticism and his tendency to follow arguments without\npre-arranging their conclusions make it difficult to categorize his\nthought. It is the attitude of inquiry that Bayle displays, rather\nthan any doctrine he espouses, that mark his as distinctively\nEnlightenment thought. He is fearless and presumptuous in questioning\nall manner of dogma. His attitude of inquiry resembles both that of\nDescartes\u2019 meditator and that of the person undergoing\nenlightenment as Kant defines it, the attitude of coming to think for\noneself, of daring to know. This epistemological attitude, as manifest\nin distrust of authority and reliance on one\u2019s own capacity to\njudge, expresses the Enlightenment values of individualism and\nself-determination.\n\nThis skeptical/critical attitude underlies a significant tension in\nthe age. While it is common to conceive of the Enlightenment as\nsupplanting the authority of tradition and religious dogma with the\nauthority of reason, in fact the Enlightenment is characterized by a\ncrisis of authority regarding any belief. This is perhaps best\nillustrated with reference to David Hume\u2019s skepticism, as\ndeveloped in Book One of A Treatise of Human Nature\n(1739\u201340) and in his later Enquiries Concerning Human\nUnderstanding (1748). While one might take Hume\u2019s\nskepticism to imply that he is an outlier with respect to the\nEnlightenment, it is more convincing to see Hume\u2019s skepticism as\na flowering of a crisis regarding authority in belief that is internal\nto the Enlightenment. Hume articulates a variety of skepticisms. His\n\u201cskepticism with regard to the senses\u201d is structured by\nthe epistemological problem bound up with the way of ideas, described\nabove. Hume also articulates skepticism with regard to reason in an\nargument that is anticipated by Bayle. Hume begins this argument by\nnoting that, though rules or principles in demonstrative sciences are\ncertain or infallible, given the fallibility of our faculties, our\napplications of such rules or principles in demonstrative inferences\nyield conclusions that cannot be regarded as certain or infallible. On\nreflection, our conviction in the conclusions of demonstrative\nreasoning must be qualified by an assessment of the likelihood that we\nmade a mistake in our reasoning. Thus, Hume writes, \u201call\nknowledge degenerates into probability\u201d (Treatise,\nI.iv.i). Hume argues further that, given this degeneration, for any\njudgment, our assessment of the likelihood that we made a mistake, and\nthe corresponding diminution of certainty in the conclusion, is\nanother judgment about which we ought make a further assessment, which\nleads to a further diminution of certainty in our original conclusion,\nleading \u201cat last [to] a total extinction of belief and\nevidence\u201d. Hume also famously questions the justification of\ninductive reasoning and causal reasoning. According to Hume\u2019s\nargument, since in causal reasoning we take our past observations to\nserve as evidence for judgments regarding what will happen in\nrelevantly similar circumstances in the future, causal reasoning\ndepends on the assumption that the future course of nature will\nresemble the past; and there is no non-circular justification of this\nessential assumption. Hume concludes that we have no rational\njustification for our causal or inductive judgments. Hume\u2019s\nskeptical arguments regarding causal reasoning are more radical than\nhis skeptical questioning of reason as such, insofar as they call into\nquestion even experience itself as a ground for knowledge and\nimplicitly challenge the credentials of Newtonian science itself, the\nvery pride of the Enlightenment. The question implicitly raised by\nHume\u2019s powerful skeptical arguments is whether any\nepistemological authority at all can withstand critical scrutiny. The\nEnlightenment begins by unleashing skepticism in attacking limited,\ncircumscribed targets, but once the skeptical genie is out of the\nbottle, it becomes difficult to maintain conviction in any authority.\nThus, the despairing attitude that Hume famously expresses in the\nconclusion to Book One of the Treatise, as the consequence of\nhis epistemological inquiry, while it clashes with the self-confident\nand optimistic attitude we associate with the Enlightenment, in fact\nreflects an essential possibility in a distinctive Enlightenment\nproblematic regarding authority in belief.\n",
