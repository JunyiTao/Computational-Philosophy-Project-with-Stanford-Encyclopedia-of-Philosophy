    "main_text": "God || God\u2019s Simplicity\n2.2 God\u2019s Simplicity\n\nWhen one clearly and distinctly cognizes the nature of God, one\nperceives God as simple, immaterial and infinite. In traditional\nChristian doctrine, these attributes are of paramount importance. Any\nphilosophical theory compromising them must be rejected. Norris\nexplains:\n\nThe Truth and Necessity of these Attributes is so Unquestionably\ncertain in the Nature of that Glorious and Adorable Being which we\ncall God, that there needs no other Evidence of the Falshood of any\nHypothesis how rational soever and well adjusted it may\notherwise appear, than the Repugnance which it shall be convinc\u2019d to\ncarry in it to all or any of these Attributes. And therefore it is\nnecessary to acquit our Theory of Ideas from that Inconvenience which\non this side it may seem to lie open to, and which alone would be\nsufficient utterly to Silence and Overthrow it. And since it is\nNecessary, \u2018tis no little Satisfaction to me to find it\nso Feasible. (Theory I 293)\n\n\nSome critics, including Arnauld, had charged Malebranche with\nSpinozism because he claimed God has the idea of intelligible\nextension. Such critics reasoned that the only way for God to contain\nextension is for God to be extended. Norris reconciles God\u2019s\npossession of intelligible extension with the immateriality of God by\nusing the notion of eminent containment. There are two ways a thing\ncan be contained in another, formally or eminently. Norris notes\nformal and eminent containment are usually discussed in the context of\ncausation. Generally, formal containment explains cause and effect\nsequences amongst similar causes and effects. For example, the cause\nof a child\u2019s fear might be the recollection of a frightening image.\nThe child\u2019s fear is formally contained in the recollection. Eminent\ncontainment explains dissimilar causes and effects. When an architect\ndesigns a building, and several months later the architect\u2019s vision is\nrealized in a physical structure, that physical structure was\neminently contained, or contained in a higher manner, in the mind of\nthe architect. All human actions, as long as they are planned, are\neminently contained in the human mind. Analogously, Norris states God\neminently contains extension as a divine idea just as the architect\neminently contains the building. Intelligible extension, then, is a\ndivine idea. Norris believes that the ideal philosophy can settle the\nmeaning of \u2018eminent containment\u2019, and thus settle the\ndispute about intelligible extension. This view is found in\n\u201cPOSTSCRIPT, Concerning the Distinction of Formaliter\nand Eminenter, as applied to the manner of the Perfection\nof Things being in God,\u201d appended to Theory I.\n\nNorris derives the \u201cdivine ideality,\u201d or the divine ideas,\nfrom the infinitude of God, and he derives God\u2019s infinity from the\ndivine ideas (Norris argues this is non-circular as we shall see\nbelow):\n\nAnd as his Ideality may be Demonstratively proved from his Infinity so\nhis Infinity may be very Rationally collected from his Ideality, it\nbeing not Conceivable that any Being that is not Infinite in Being,\nshould be Omniform, or have the Ideal Reasons of all things\nin himself. (297)\n\n\nOne objection Norris raises concerns how the infinite can represent\nthe finite. His answer again relies upon the thought of Suarez, whom\nNorris reread carefully before writing his Theories I and\nII. Suarez had distinguished two ways of being finite. An\nitem can be finite according to its \u201cesse\nformale\u201d or its \u201cesse reale\u201d (300). If\na thing is positively finite, it is limited in such a way that can\nnever be infinite. If a thing is negatively finite, it is finite\n\u201cthough there be no repugnance in its having it [infinitude]\nfrom elsewhere\u201d (301\u2013302, brackets added). A divine idea,\naccording to its esse formale is negatively finite whereas\naccording to its esse reale is infinite. Norris believes\n\u201cIdeas are really Identical with the Divine Nature, and so\npartake of the same real Infinity and Incomprehensibility that\nessentially belongs to it\u201d (302). If each idea is identical to\nGod, then each idea is really infinite, and negatively finite. A\nfurther consequence is that an idea can be called both infinite and\nfinite without contradiction. Norris also notes there is no\nmultiplication of infinities in God on his view. Here Norris diverges\nfrom Malebranche\u2019s view as stated in the second dialogue of\nDialogues on Metaphysics and Religion that God is\n\u201cinfinitely infinite,\u201d which strikes the reader as\ncomparable to Spinoza\u2019s infinite attributes.\n\nOne might wonder how God\u2019s ideality could be proven from his infinity\nand his infinity from his ideality because such an argument appears\ncircular. Norris explains why this need not concern us:\n\nBut now there is no more absurdity in proving the same by the same, if\nby the same be meant only really, not formally the same, than in\nproving one attribute of God by another, as his eternity, suppose,\nfrom the necessity or immutability of his being, which though really\nthe same, yet being of a distinct formality, are allowed in all\nrational discourses about them to be considered and used as if really\ndistinct, as to any consequence from one to the other. (406\u2013407)\n\n\nIndeed, Norris proves the existence of God from the nature of truth,\nwhich is another divine attribute. (See A Metaphysical Essay\n193\u2013207 in Miscellanies.) Norris also proves the many\nattributes of God beginning with God\u2019s attribute of necessary\nexistence, revealed in His proclamation to Moses that He is \u201cI\nAm.\u201d In Reason and Religion Norris interprets this\nproclamation as Being. These various demonstrations proceed by proving\n\u201cthe same by the same\u201d since any and all attributes are\n\u201creally the same\u201d with one another, the attributes are\nidentical to God.\n\nThese arguments preserve the divine attribute of simplicity. If God is\nsimple, then proofs utilizing different attributes must be proofs that\nutilize the same subject. The diversity of the attributes are\nexplained as various ways of cognizing the same divine essence:\n\n\u2026 this Divine Essence which in itself is one and the same\ngeneral Perfection, does exert and display it self variously in its\nOperations, by reason of the Diversity of Objects, the Attributes of\nGod are by us conceiv\u2019d distinctly. Not that they are so in respect of\nGod, with whom they are really one and the same, and consequently so\nalso among themselves, but only with respect to our manner of\nconception. (Reason and Religion 33\u201334)\n\n\nNorris proceeds to explain how an attribute such as omnipotence can be\naccounted for because it is \u201cdisplayed according to the\ndiversity of objects\u201d and \u201cModes of operation\u201d (34).\nIn the mode of creating, God is the omnipotent Creator. The relevant\nobject here is all of creation. In the mode of legislator, God is the\nSupreme Lawgiver, and the relevant object is the moral realm. The\ndiverse ways of considering the natural world are also the many ways\nwe can conceive of God\u2019s attributes. In the end, humanity has partial,\nimperfect views of God according to his operations. A lesser being,\nsuch as a human, can also be known under many operations. One might be\na parent, spouse, writer and teacher. But that person is defined in\nthose roles because of the objects that these titles refer to; in the\ncase of the teacher, the person is a teacher only with respect to the\nstudents taught. One is a parent only with respect to the role played\ntowards offspring, but the person is \u201creally one and the\nsame.\u201d Just as we might come to know an individual better and\nbetter as we come to know more of the person\u2019s roles, so we come to\nknow God better by conceiving of his many attributes. Norris believes\nthat all attributes are one in God, differently conceived according to\nthe roles played and objects considered.\n\nFurthermore, Norris reduces the eternal truths, which are the\naccidental relations amongst the divine ideas to the ideas themselves,\nand then reduces the ideas to God:\n\nThe Divine Ideas are really the same with the Divine Essence. But\nEternal Truths are really the same with the Divine Ideas. Therefore\nEternal Truths are really the same with the Divine Essence.\n(Theory I 332\u2013333)\n\n\nSo it is odd that, after laying out these arguments for the simplicity\nof God, Norris states that the flaw in Descartes\u2019 account of\nvoluntarism is that Descartes had attributed to the divine will what\nbelongs to another attribute of God \u2013 the divine ideality. If\nthe attributes are all one, it is difficult to argue for a priority\namongst attributes. Nonetheless, Norris argues that Descartes was\ncorrect to claim truth must depend on God alone, but incorrectly\nbelieved God arbitrarily creates the eternal truth, for this renders\ntruth as mutable as any other creature. What Descartes missed,\naccording to Norris, was the distinction between God as\nintelligible, or exhibitive, and God as intelligent,\nor conceptive (Miscellanies 440, Theory I\n357\u2013358). To understand God as conceptive is to understand God\nas a thinker, who reflects upon his own ideas. To understand God as\nexhibitive is to understand God qua divine ideas. The\ncomplexity arising from including ideas in the divine mind is a\nfurther difficulty for divine simplicity. In the end, if Norris is to\nbe read as consistent, he must claim that the divine ideality is\nanother attribute of God. Norris might have taken Malebranche\u2019s lead,\nwho wrote, concerning divine simplicity, \u201cI long stopped\nworrying about problems that are beyond me\u201d (qtd. in Schmaltz\n2000 62). But it is noteworthy that Norris did not; concerning the\ntopic of divine simplicity, Norris advances the work of his\npredecessors, in particular the work of Malebranche. In a passage\nreminiscent of Thomistic analogical predication, Norris suggests that\nGod as intelligent, or as engaging in thought, must be\nradically different from our experiences of cogitation:\n\nAnd herein (if I rightly consider what is before me) the conduct of\nthe infinitely wise God differs from that of men. They first form\ntheir design, and then deliberate about the means whereby they may\naccomplish it. And this makes men (who in all things are apt to\nmeasure God by themselves, though he himself tells us that his ways\nare not as our ways) inclinable to think that God does so too, that he\nfirst projects, and then consults his wisdom how to execute. This\nindeed is our way, but this cannot be God\u2019s way, because \u2018tis\nnot the wisest way. (Theory I 44)\n\n\nThe extent of humanity\u2019s knowledge of the essence of God is a problem\nthat has preoccupied many thinkers in the history of Western\nphilosophy. Unlike other areas of inquiry, questions concerning the\nnature of God, even if they are unanswerable now, receive answers in\nthe next life. Although Norris believes that we can answer many\nimportant questions about the divine essence, our view of the\nintelligible world is dim indeed. He concedes that certain mysteries\nare temporarily beyond our ken. Norris would agree with what Descartes\nwrote in his First Replies:\n\nMoreover, God cannot be distinctly known by those who look from a\ndistance, as it were, and try to make their minds encompass his\nentirety all at once. This is the sense in which St. Thomas\nsays\u2026that the knowledge of God is within us \u2018in a\nsomewhat confused manner\u2019. But those who try to attend to God\u2019s\nindividual perfections and try not so much to take hold of them as to\nsurrender to them, using all the strength of their intellect to\ncontemplate them, will certainly find that God provides much more\nample and straightforward subject-matter for clear and distinct\nknowledge than does any created thing. (Philosophical\nWritings, 81\u201382)\n\n\nHumanity does have some reliable knowledge about some subject-matter,\nand Norris offers an account of this partial enlightenment. Norris\nbelieves, for example, that we know enough to clearly and distinctly:\n1. Accept Descartes\u2019 real distinction proof and 2. Refute Locke\u2019s\nthinking matter hypothesis.\n",
