    "main_text": "The Problem of Blackness\n1. The Problem of Blackness\n\nIn 1952, Fanon published his first major work Black Skin, White\nMasks. Though just 27 at the time of its publication, the work\ndisplays incredible literacy in major intellectual trends of the time:\npsychoanalysis, existentialism, phenomenology, and dialectics, as well\nas, most prominently, the early N\u00e9gritude movement and U.S.\nbased critical race work in figures like Richard Wright. Modest in\nlength, the book is notable for its enormous ambition, seeking to\nunderstand the foundations of anti-Black racism in the deepest\nrecesses of consciousness and the social world. The book is\nFanon\u2019s major work on blackness. In fact, his focus shifts in\nthe years following the publication of Black Skin, White\nMasks, moving away from blackness as a problem\u2014perhaps\nthe problem\u2014of the modern world and toward a wider\ntheory of the oppressed, colonialism, and revolutionary resistance to\nthe reach of coloniality as a system. But that shift is unthinkable\nwithout Fanon\u2019s early meditations on anti-Black racism.\nFanon\u2019s reflections on anti-Black racism and how it forms, then\ndeforms, the subjectivity of white and Black people both, is crucial\nfor understanding the multiple levels of colonial subjugation and the\nterms of its overcoming. There is something about anti-blackness as\ntreated in Black Skin, White Masks that is a concrete,\nuncomplicated distillation of coloniality as such. Fanon\u2019s first\nbook, then, can be said to set out the basic structure of his anti-\nand de-colonial work, initially and emphatically in the terms of\ndescribing the effects and affects of anti-black racism.\n\nFanon\u2019s method in Black Skin, White Masks is a\ncomplicated question and one of the more interesting bits of scholarly\ndiscussion. The primary approach in the text is\nexistential-phenomenological, something borne out in the rich,\ntextured personal narratives that seize upon the essential structures\nof the narrativized event of anti-blackness, and also indicated in the\ntitle of the fifth chapter\u2014L\u2019experience\nv\u00e9cu (experience v\u00e9cu translates the key\nphenomenological notion of Erlebnis, properly rendered in the\nRichard Philcox translation as \u201clived-experience\u201d). Lewis\nGordon\u2019s work on Fanon has argued for the centrality of\nexistentialism and existential framing of key questions across his\noeuvre, especially in Gordon\u2019s early work Fanon and the\nCrisis of European Humanity (1995) and recently in What Fanon\nSaid (2015). The influence of Jean-Paul Sartre and Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty also lends credence to the phenomenological\ncharacterization, but Fanon\u2019s sustained engagement with the\nN\u00e9gritude movement, psychoanalysis, Hegelian thought, and\nMarxism (something evidenced most clearly in later works and\ndocumented in Reiland Rabaka\u2019s multi-volume interpretation of\nFanon, N\u00e9gritude, and revolutionary Africana theory) opens up\nthe question of methodology to any number of interpretations and\nremains one of the more engaging areas of Fanon-interpretation. Homi\nBhabha\u2019s innovation as a reader of Fanon has been to draw out\nthe post-structuralist dimensions of his thought, thereby weaving\nFanonian themes into contemporary postcolonial theorizations of\nhybridity, language, subjectivity, and time. We see much the same in\nAnthony Alessandrini\u2019s provocative book on Fanon and cultural\nstudies, Fanon and the Future of Cultural Politics (2014),\nwhich puts Fanonian thinking in dialogue with Michel Foucault, Edward\nSaid, Jamaica Kincaid, and Paul Gilroy, among others. In the end,\nFanon is a unique thinker who blends personal narrative and\npolitical strategizing with heady social theory and numerous\nphilosophical twists and turns.\n\nThe introduction to Black Skin, White Masks contains key\nconclusions and foundational pieces of analysis summed up\nFanon\u2019s simple declaration: that Black people are locked in\nblackness and white people are locked in whiteness. As well, Fanon\noffers a sketch of the relationship between ontology and sociological\nstructures, asserting that the latter generate the former, which, in\nturn, lock subjectivities into their racial categories. The chapters\nthat follow are in many ways a long, sustained argument for these\nassertions, venturing into questions of language, sexuality,\nembodiment, and dialectics. Perhaps most importantly, Fanon\u2019s\nopening gambit introduces the central concept of the zone of\nnon-being. The zone of non-being is the \u201chell\u201d, as Fanon\nputs it, of blackness honestly confronted with its condition in an\nanti-Black world. The anti-Black world, the only world we know, hides\nthis non-being to the extent that it ascribes a place and role to\nabject blackness. But the truth is the zone of non-being. In an\ninteresting and crucial twist, Fanon, in the Introduction, does not\ndescribe descent into this zone as nihilism or despair. Rather, he\ncounters with a vision of subjectivity as \u201ca yes that\nvibrates to cosmic harmonies\u201d (1952 [2008: 2]). Descent into the\nzone of non-being produces this yes and its revolutionary\npower, revolutionary precisely because the anti-Black world cannot\ncontain or sustain the affirmation of Black life as life, as being, as\nhaving a claim on the world. This claim and this yes is the\npositivity of what becomes political violence in Fanon\u2019s later\nwork.\n\nAcross the core chapters of Black Skin, White Masks, Fanon\ndraws together the existential experience of racialized subjectivity\nand the calculative logic of colonial rule. For Fanon, and this is\ncritically important, colonialism is a total project. It is a\nproject that does not leave any part of the human person and its\nreality untouched. This is no more evident than in the opening chapter\nto Black Skin, White Masks on language. Fanon\u2019s\nreflections on language, racism, and colonialism begin with a wide\nclaim: to speak a language is to participate in a world, to adopt a\ncivilization. The claim reflects in many ways the philosophical milieu\nof mid-century French and German philosophy, which in phenomenology,\nexistentialism, and hermeneutics explore the very same\nclaim\u2014that language, subjectivity, and reality are entangled as\na matter of essence, not confusion or indistinction. But the colonial\nsituation makes this all the more complicated. If speaking a language\nmeans participating in a world and adopting a civilization, then the\nlanguage of the colonized, a language imposed by centuries of colonial\ndomination and dedicated to the elimination or abjection of other\nexpressive forms, speaks the world of the colonizer. To speak as the\ncolonized is therefore to participate in one\u2019s own oppression\nand to reflect the very structures of your alienation in everything\nfrom vocabulary to syntax to intonation. It is true that many\nAfro-Caribbeans speak pidgin and creole as part of everyday life. But\nFanon, in a claim that does not age well in Caribbean theory, measures\npidgin and creole expression against French, arguing that\nAfro-Caribbean speaking, in those registers, is a fallen, impoverished\nversion of the metropolitan language and thus participates in\ninferiority. In this way, vernacular speech speaks the\ncolonizer\u2019s world into existence in naming the colonized as\nderivative, less than, and fundamentally abject. Caribbean theory from\nthe 1970s to the present has largely been dedicated to defending the\nlegitimacy of creolized language and cultural forms, against Fanon and\nagainst colonial languages as the measure of being and knowing.\n\nBut there is no alternative for Fanon. In one of the most important\nmoments of the book, Fanon discusses the problem of diction and racial\nembodiment. The black person can perfect speech, learn to speak\nperfect French and sound like a sophisticated Parisian. That\nmight promise a certain kind of liberation from the\nalienation in and through mastery of proper French. That is, if the\nblack colonial learns to speak as well as the white Parisian, then\nperhaps there can be equal participation in language and its world.\nYet, this is impossible because of what Fanon terms the\nepidermal character of race. To be black and speak with\nperfect diction is still to be black, and therefore marked as special,\nunique, and surprising. Fanon\u2019s anecdotes in the opening chapter\ndescribe this as the surprise of white French people at the\narticulateness of a black French speaker. Surprise is a reminder of\ninferiority, not in the content of one\u2019s presence, but rather on\nthe bearing black skin has on the white mask of perfect diction. There\nis no escape from the epidermal skin. Embodiment frames linguistic\nperformance and limits its significance. Fanon also remarks on how\nthis fated-to-failure emphasis on diction in turn alienates the black\nperson from his or her fellow black people\u2014the desire to be\nwhite, Fanon\u2019s characterization of the drive to perfect diction,\nmeans alienation from blackness and this lands the black subject,\nagain, in the zone of non-being.\n\nThe second and third chapters of Black Skin, White Masks\ntheorize interracial sexuality, sexual desire, and the effects on\nracial identity. Fanon\u2019s theorizations return to one and the\nsame theme: interracial desire as a form of self-destruction in the\ndesire to be white or to elevate one\u2019s social, political, and\ncultural status in proximity to whiteness. In that sense, all\ndepictions of interracial sexuality (exclusively heterosexual) are for\nFanon fundamentally pathological. The black woman who desires a white\nman suffers under the delusion that his body is a bridge to wealth and\naccess. Mayotte Cap\u00e9cia\u2019s novel I Am a Martinican\nWoman (1948) guides Fanon\u2019s analysis and he takes her book\nto be exemplary of the black woman\u2019s psyche and of the limits of\ninterracial desire. The black man who desires a white woman suffers\nunder the delusions of what her body offers: innocence and purity.\nFanon draws this from Germaine Guex\u2019s book La N\u00e9vrose\nd\u2019abandon (1950) and expresses it directly when writing, in\nthe voice of Guex\u2019s Black man, \u201cWhen my restless hands\ncaress those white breasts, they grasp white civilization and dignity\nand make them mine\u201d (1952 [2008: 45]). The white body and Black\ndesire for that body function much as language does in the opening\nchapter to Black Skin, White Masks: the passage to standing\nin the world, made impossible by the epidermal racial scheme, and\ntherefore fated to alienation at every turn. Fanon\u2019s analyses\nare provocative, associative, and infused with the language of\npsychoanalysis and existential-phenomenology. And, thus, in each turn\nof the story, interracial desire is pathological, not because of the\ncontent of the characters and their desire, but because anti-Black\ncolonialism is a total project that has infiltrated, modified, and\ncalcified all aspects of the lifeworld.\n\nThe incredibly important fifth chapter to Black Skin, White\nMasks, titled \u201cThe Lived-Experience of the Black Man\u201d\n(\u201cL\u2019exp\u00e9rience v\u00e9cue du noir\u201d), is\nbookended by two chapters examining psychological accounts of the\ncolonized. In the fourth chapter, Fanon undertakes a systematic\ncritique of Octave Mannoni\u2019s psychoanalytic account of colonial\noppression and in the sixth chapter he works through a psychoanalytic\naccount of racialized libidinal economy. Both chapters are crucial for\nunderstanding the role of psychoanalysis in Fanon\u2019s thought, as\nwell as an opportunity to see his creativity as a reader who\nrepurposes colonial or colonial-tinged methods and analyses for the\nsake of clarification of the effects of anti-Black racism under\ncolonial domination. Fanon\u2019s conclusions are not surprising, of\ncourse. Psychoanalysis, like his original readings of interracial\nrelationships, provides Fanon a language for describing all the\neffects and affects on desire under anti-Black racism, and how\ngendered notions of power, embodiment, and selfhood are structured\nfrom the inside by the colonial practice of racism. What he\nuncovers in his critique and repurposing of psychoanalysis are new\nlayers of pathology on the part of the colonizer, of course, but also\nof the colonized who cannot function as intact psyches. As well, Fanon\nargues in some detail against the capacity of European psychoanalysis\nto understand the colonial situation. Blackness requires modifications\nin method, especially if that method is to open space for resistance,\nrebellion, and liberation.\n\nBut \u201cThe Lived-Experience of the Black Man\u201d is really the\nkey chapter in the book. In that chapter, Fanon deploys the conceptual\ntools developed in previous chapters in order to debunk the remaining\nlegacies of racial essentialism. A good bit of this was undertaken in\nthe first chapter, where Fanon critically reads Aim\u00e9\nC\u00e9saire and his articulation of N\u00e9gritude around the\nquestion of language. The existential-phenomenological character of\nthe fifth chapter, however, adds real depth and texture to\nFanon\u2019s position. It begins and returns repeatedly to an\nanecdote in which a white child points to Fanon and declares\n\u201cLook, a Negro!\u201d Fanon explores how this phrase is akin to\na racial slur, how racism is integral to the declaration itself rather\nthan being an addition to it: to say \u201cNegro\u201d is to say an\nanti-Black slur. In developing this account, Fanon revisits Jean-Paul\nSartre\u2019s account of the gaze and how it fixes the identity of\nthe other, here infusing that account with a rich treatment of the\nstructures of an anti-Black racist lifeworld. The white gaze fixes\nblackness, making it with a slur and epidermal character, thus sealing\nblackness into itself. As well, Fanon discusses Sartre\u2019s account\nof anti-Semitism in Anti-Semite and Jew: An Exploration of the\nEtiology of Racism (1948), noting how it is inadequate to the\nphenomenon of anti-Blackness as a form of racism. Whereas the\nanti-Semite fears the Jew because of his alleged power and\nsuper-capacity, the anti-Black racist detests the Black person because\nof his alleged weakness and incapacity. That is, anti-Semitism\nreflects a panic about Jewish superiority, anti-Black racism reflects\ncontempt for Black inferiority. With this complex in place, Fanon\nreturns with some important sympathy to C\u00e9saire\u2019s version\nof N\u00e9gritude, exploring the limits and possibilities of poetry\nfor an alternative vision of Black life. N\u00e9gritude may be\nna\u00efve and fundamentally wrong at the level of ontology, but it\ndoes alter the affective relation of Black people to themselves. That\nis no small accomplishment. Across these discussions, Fanon develops\nhis notion of the inferiority complex, which is his subtle and\nimportant account of how anti-Black racism is internalized by Black\npeople and how that internalization adds complexity to the pathologies\nof living under colonial rule. N\u00e9gritude, whatever its limits,\nis an antidote and Fanon\u2019s appreciation for it is one of the\nmore compelling parts of the chapter.\n\nThe seventh and final full chapter offers a critical reading of\ndialectics, filtered through both Alfred Adler\u2019s psychology and\nG.W.F. Hegel\u2019s philosophy. At stake in the chapter is\nrecognition\u2014recognition of blackness, of subjectivity, and\ntherefore of humanity. This is one of the most enigmatic ideas in\nBlack Skin, White Masks. Fanon is deeply critical of\ndialectical thinking, while at the same time drawing deep, important\nlessons from it. In particular, Fanon is concerned with how a\ndialectics of recognition might simply mean elevation of the\nBlack person to a sense of humanity created by and modeled on white\npeople. The entirety of the text, of course, has been dedicated to\ndisputing that move and offering alternative ways of thinking about\nthe future. So Fanon rejects the nascent, or sometimes explicit,\nconception of recognition that appeals to a pre-constructed idea of\nthe human\u2014suspicious, rightly, that such an idea is always\nracialized. And so too he is suspicious of any dialectical method that\nleaves a sense of measure intact\u2014namely, a dialectical method\nthat proceeds from a logic of recognition. Fanon resists at every turn\nthe desire for recognition if that recognition proceeds from an\ninevitably colonial sense of standard or measure. Rather, in terms of\nHegelian methodology, Fanon is interested in the risk of life at the\ncenter of Hegel\u2019s dialectic, and how that dialectic both exposes\nthe conceptual dependency of the colonizer on the colonized\nand how confrontation, the work of negation in dialectical\nthinking and struggle, aims to destroy pre-existing forms of relation.\nIf those pre-existing forms of relation are destroyed, then a certain\nkind of revolution is possible, one in which the humanity of the\ncolonized black person might emerge, on its own terms, for the first\ntime. Fanon\u2019s imagination turns to the future as unprecedented.\nWhat could blackness be after colonialism?\n\nThe conclusion to Black Skin, White Masks follows through on\nthis notion of futurity and a dialectics dedicated to the destruction\nof pre-existing forms of relation. Fanon\u2019s conclusion is written\nin very short paragraphs or provocative, declarative sentences. Across\nthe final pages, Fanon outlines a theory of history and memory that\nunderpins his vision of Black liberation, including most prominently\nthe notion that we are not bound to history, we are not slaves to the\npast, and therefore any kind of future is possible. Fanon rejects the\nidea of reparations, for example, precisely because that idea would\nlink Black people to the past in a crucial way and make that link\ninextricable from imagining justice. In place of the past, Fanon\nappeals to the openness and undetermined character of the future. What\ndoes Fanon want for black people? In perhaps the most famous line of\nthe book, Fanon concludes with the plea: \u201c\u00d4 mon corps,\nfais de moi toujours un homme qui interroge!\u201d (\u201cO my body,\nalways make me a man who questions!\u201d) (1952 [2008:\n206]). Subjectivity in the interrogative is therefore Fanon\u2019s\nsolution to the problem of racial entrapment, the opening motif of how\nwhite people are trapped in whiteness, black people trapped in\nblackness. The man who questions has broken out of that trap.\n\nThe effusive optimism and hope of the Conclusion aside, Black\nSkin, White Masks is an essentially pessimistic book. That is,\nthe book describes a psychological, linguistic, ontological, and\nlibidinal landscape that is structured through and through by\nanti-Black racism. No desire or mode of being is left untouched.\nFanon\u2019s evocation of a total break with the past in the\nConclusion confirms this pessimism and shows that his sense of\nliberation is tied to an apocalyptic revolutionary\npraxis\u2014something we see developed over the following decade.\n\nIn the immediate half-decade that follows the publication of Black\nSkin, White Masks, Fanon revisits key claims about anti-blackness\nand the possibilities of Black life that enrich, deepen, and widen his\nformulations in 1952. One of the questions that arises quite naturally\nfrom Black Skin, White Masks is how well, if at all, the\nconcept of blackness developed therein travels across the Caribbean to\nthe United States, or from the Caribbean to Africa. Fanon does not\nspend much time discussing the United States; while some of his\nunpublished work, recently collected in the volume \u00c9crits\nsur l\u2019ali\u00e9nation et la libert\u00e9, shows a keen\ninterest in the work of Richard Wright, and the early rustlings of the\nearly civil rights movement (along with Wright) are mentioned in\nBlack Skin, Whites Masks, Fanon\u2019s move to refine and\nnuance his account of blackness turns to Africa. In the 1955 essay\n\u201cWest Indians and Africans\u201d (\u201cAntillais et Africains\u201d),\nFanon renews his critique of the N\u00e9gritude movement and its\nnostalgic orientation toward the continent. In a provocative\nassociation, Fanon concludes the essay by linking \u201cthe great\nwhite error\u201d of colonialism with his characterization of\nN\u00e9gritude thinking as \u201cliving in the great black\nmirage\u201d. (1964 [1994: 27]) Alongside that criticism of\nN\u00e9gritude, Fanon blends personal history, reportage, and a bit\nof existential-historical sensibility in discussing the\ndifferences between Afro-Caribbeans (West Indians) and black\nAfricans. Fanon\u2019s occasion is the Second World War and the\nexperience of West Indian and black African soldiers fighting side by\nside, which allowed intimate exchange about racial identity. These\nexchanges, on Fanon\u2019s account, return again and again to the\nnotion that West Indians are not Black enough, perhaps not Black at\nall, which he implies adds to the psychological and moral appeal of\nN\u00e9gritude. A key lesson to draw from this essay, especially in\nlight of the work that follows it, is that Fanon\u2019s skepticism\nabout blackness as an identity\u2014inextricably bound to\nanti-blackness\u2014moves him further and further away from concerns\nabout the Black experience. This move is deeply connected to his time\nin Algeria, as we see below.\n As well, Fanon\u2019s well-known essay from 1956 \u201cRacism\nand Culture\u201d (\u201cRacisme et culture\u201d) re-engages the question of\nblackness and argues for a deep, abiding connection between\nanti-blackness and cultural formation more broadly. The essay,\ndelivered at one of the most important gatherings in the history of\nblack Atlantic thought, the 1956 Congress of Negro Writers and\nArtists, de-links racism from the psyche and the interpersonal,\nlodging racism instead inside the very workings of\nculture. Fanon\u2019s contribution to the 1956 Congress broke from\nthe emphasis on N\u00e9gritude and N\u00e9gritude thinking at that\nmeeting, and his reflections are noteworthy for that reason alone.\nAgainst the emphasis on racial quasi-essentialism, \u201cRacism and\nCulture\u201d examines how anti-Black racism is part of the structure\nand function of culture, rather than identifying blackness as an\ninherent site of resistance. Fanon writes that racism \n\n\nis never a super-added element discovered by chance in the course of\nthe investigation of the cultural data of a group. The social\nconstellation, the cultural whole, is deeply modified by the existence\nof racism. (1964 [1994: 36]) \n\n\nThis move positions Fanon against N\u00e9gritude in familiar and new\nways. It is familiar in that he rejects racialized thinking as central\nto Black liberation struggle, entwining race and culture at their\ncore; nothing from a racist culture can inform liberatory racial\nthinking precisely because the existence of racism \u201cdeeply\nmodifies\u201d what appears in culture as race. Fanon\nunderscores this when he deems blues, an African-American vernacular\nart form, a \u201cslave lament\u201d that is \u201coffered up for\nthe admiration of the oppressors\u201d (1964 [1994: 37]). It is in\nsome ways new, insofar as he gathers together the multi-faceted\nanalysis and pessimism of Black Skin, White Masks and\ndistills it all into a vision of race and culture. And like the\nconclusion to Black Skin, White Masks, and indeed most of his\nwork, the vision is essentially apocalyptic. \u201cThe end of race\nprejudice\u201d, Fanon writes, \u201cbegins with a sudden\nincomprehension\u201d (1964 [1994: 44]). Which is to say, for Fanon\nthe de-linking of racism and culture only comes at the moment that\nculture itself, as we have known it, becomes incomprehensible and we\nbegin the work of assembling new cultural forms. This insight is fully\ndeveloped five years later in the central chapters of The Wretched\nof the Earth.\n",
