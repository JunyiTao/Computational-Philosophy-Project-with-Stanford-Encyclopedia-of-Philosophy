    "main_text": "Logical Fatalism: Aristotle\u2019s argument and the nature of truth || Truth and fatalism\n1.5 Truth and fatalism\n\nAristotle\u2019s problem seemed to have arisen as a result of a\ntheory of truth according to which, if a statement is true at a time,\nthere has to be a state of the world at that time which makes it true.\nHowever, it has been argued that, if every meaningful statement is\neither true or false (once and for all), that alone implies fatalism;\nthe very fact that a statement is true is enough to make what it\ndescribes unavoidable (Taylor 1983, Chapter 6). Suppose, for example,\nthat John shaved one morning. Then the statement, \u201cJohn shaved\nthat morning\u201d, is true. But, it is argued, that means that John\ndid not have the power not to shave; because to have that power would\nbe to have the power to render a true statement false. But no one has\nsuch a power; no one has ever succeeded in making a true statement\nfalse.\n\nNow the final claim is certainly true, on the assumption that\nmeaningful statements have just one truth-value. No one has ever\nbrought about a situation in which a statement which was true is\nfalse; that is, a situation in which (a) there is a statement which\nwas true and (b) that statement is now false. However, to have the\npower to render a true statement false, one does need to have the\npower to bring about such a situation. It is enough that (a) there\nshould be a statement which is true, and that one has the power merely\nto bring about a situation in which (b) that statement is (and always\nwas) false instead. So for John to have had the power to\nrender false the true statement, \u201cJohn shaved that\nmorning\u201d, it is enough that he should have had the power not to\nshave instead of shaving. Of course, he did not exercise that power;\nbut, in the absence of some other argument to the contrary, presumably\nhe could have done; in which case he would have made the statement,\n\u201cJohn shaved that morning\u201d false instead of true. So, it\nseems that there is no simple move from truth to fatalism.\n",
