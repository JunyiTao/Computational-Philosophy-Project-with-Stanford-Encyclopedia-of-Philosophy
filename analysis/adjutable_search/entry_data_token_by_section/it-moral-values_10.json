Dewey had an expansive definition of technology which\nincluded not only common tools and machines but information systems\nsuch as logic, laws and even language as well (Hickman 1990). Dewey\nargued that we are in a \u2018transactional\u2019 relationship with\nall of these technologies within which we discover and construct our\nworld (Hickman 1990). This is a helpful standpoint to take as it\nallows us to advance the idea that an information technology of\nmorality and ethics is not impossible. As well as allowing us to take\nseriously the idea that the relations and transactions between human\nagents and those that exist between humans and their artifacts have\nimportant ontological similarities. While Dewey could only dimly\nperceive the coming revolutions in information technologies, his\ntheory is useful to us still because he proposed that ethics was not\nonly a theory but a practice and solving problems in ethics is like\nsolving problems in algebra (Hickman 1990). If he is right, then an\ninteresting possibility arises, namely the possibility that ethics and\nmorality are computable problems and therefore it should be possible\nto create an information technology that can embody moral systems of\nthought. \n\nIn 1974 the philosopher Mario Bunge proposed that we take the notion\nof a \u2018technoethics\u2019 seriously arguing that moral\nphilosophers should emulate the way engineers approach a problem.\nEngineers do not argue in terms of reasoning by categorical\nimperatives but instead they use:\n\n\n\u2026 the forms If A produces B, and you value\nB, chose to do A, and If A produces\nB and C produces D, and you prefer\nB to D, choose A rather than C. In\nshort, the rules he comes up with are based on fact and value, I\nsubmit that this is the way moral rules ought to be fashioned, namely\nas rules of conduct deriving from scientific statements and value\njudgments. In short ethics could be conceived as a branch of\ntechnology. (Bunge 1977, 103)\n\n\nTaking this view seriously implies that the very act of building\ninformation technologies is also the act of creating specific moral\nsystems within which human and artificial agents will, at least\noccasionally, interact through moral transactions. Information\ntechnologists may therefore be in the business of creating moral\nsystems whether they know it or not and whether or not they want that\nresponsibility.\n",
