    "main_text": "Religion\n3. Religion\n\nFor a man so frequently called an atheist, Paine shows a remarkable\nconfidence in the divine order of the creation. The work that did most\nto damage his reputation in America, and which split his supporters in\nBritain, was his Age of Reason (1793/4), which was followed\nby a further part in 1795, and additional writings compiled by later\neditors into a third part, from 1804. The Age of Reason is\nnot an atheist tract, but a deist one. It combines scathing criticism\nof claims to authority for the bible by religious authorities, with an\nexpression of confidence in a divinely ordered world, revealed in\nnature through the exercise of reason, that drew heavily on the\nlectures he had attended in London prior to leaving for America, given\nby James Ferguson and Benjamin Martin. Indeed, he seemed to have\ncommitted their account to memory, and uses the text to lay out the\norder of the universe, to speculate on the possibility of a plurality\nof worlds, and to dismiss all claims for mystery, miracles and\nprophecy. God is an unmoved first cause, who designs and sets the\nuniverse in motion for the benefit of man, and the moral duty of man\nconsists in \u2018imitating the moral goodness and beneficence of\nGod, manifested in the creation toward all His\ncreatures\u2026everything of persecution and revenge between man and\nman, and everything off cruelty to animals, is a violation of moral\nduty.\u2019 (I, 512). Although the later parts of Age of\nReason descend into detailed interpretation and controversy, and\nlose much of their intuitive appeal, the first part is a powerful\nconfession of rationalist faith in a divine creator whose design can\nbe appreciated by man in the Bible of Creation, whose principles are\neternal, and which rejects as meaningless the claims to authority and\nthe theology of the Christian Churches. \u2018The study of theology,\nas it stands in the Christian churches, is the study of nothing; it is\nfounded on nothing; it rests on no principles; it produces no\nauthorities; it has no data; it can demonstrate nothing; and it admits\nof no conclusion\u2019 (CW I, 601). \u2018The only religion that has\nnot been invented, and that has in it every evidence of divine\noriginality, is pure and simple Deism\u2019 (CW I, 600). And as\nsimple government avoids us becoming the dupes of fraud, so simple\nbelief protects us from the fraud of priestcraft, which so often runs\nhand in hand with despotism.\n",
