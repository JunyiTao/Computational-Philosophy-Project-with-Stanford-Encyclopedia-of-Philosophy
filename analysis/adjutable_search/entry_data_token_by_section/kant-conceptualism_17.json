    "main_text": "Points of Dispute || Modality & Cognition\n5.8 Modality & Cognition\n\nAs we saw in\n \u00a71,\n Kant uses the term \u2018cognition\u2019 (Erkenntnis) in\ndifferent ways. But the sense of \u201cproper cognition\u201d is\noften that with which he is most concerned, as it marks out the way in\nwhich both stems of our cognitive capacity (i.e., sensibility and\nintellect) must cooperate for cognition, and ultimately substantive\nscientific knowledge, of objects to occur.\n\nKant construes such cognition as always of a really\u2014i.e.,\nmetaphysically\u2014possible subject matter. As Kant states in a\nfamous footnote in the B-preface of the first Critique:\n\n\nTo cognize an object, it is required that I be able to prove\nits possibility (whether by the testimony of experience from its\nactuality or a priori through reason). But I can\nthink whatever I like, as long as I do not contradict myself,\ni.e., as long as my concept is a possible thought, even if I cannot\ngive any assurance whether or not there is a corresponding object\nsomewhere within the sum total of all possibilities. But in order to\nascribe objective validity to such a concept (real possibility, for\nthe first sort of possibility was merely logical) something more is\nrequired. (Bxxvi, note)\n\n\nIn finite discursive beings the structure of thought is governed\nultimately by the rule of non-contradiction, and in this way concerns\nwhat is logically possible. But an analysis of the contents and laws\nof thought tells us nothing as to whether there really could be an\nobject such as the thought specifies. Thus the real possibility of an\nobject for theoretical cognition can only be determined from an actual\nground provided via experience or via a priori transcendental\nreflection (Chignell 2010; McLear 2016a). And as Kant goes on to note,\nthe \u201cmore\u201d that is required for a thought to achieve\ncognition need not always come from theoretical sources, as there may\nbe practical sources of cognition as well (Chignell 2007a; Kain 2010;\nSchafer forthcoming-b).\n\nA challenge for Intellectualism is to explain how the modal condition\non cognition may be satisfied if intuition is itself the outcome of\nsome synthetic intellectual process (Gomes and Stephenson 2016; McLear\n2016b: \u00a74.3; 2016a: \u00a78.5; cf. Parsons 1964, 1992b; Carson\n1997). There are at least two issues here. The first is that it seems\nthat such intellectual processes could supply only logical as opposed\nto \u201creal\u201d representational constraints. The second (and\nrelated issue) is that Kant\u2019s emphasis on the \u201cthe\ntestimony of experience from [the object\u2019s] actuality\u201d is\nat least some evidence for thinking that intuition\u2014as the\nsensory component of empirical cognition or\n\u201cexperience\u201d\u2014provides the needed \u201creal\u201d\nconstraint on cognition by giving proof of the real possibility of the\nsubject matter of cognition. This real constraint intuition provides\nvia its presentation of some actuality that grounds this\npossibility.\n\nReplies to these two challenges dispute the emphasis on the actuality\nof what is presented through intuition, and instead interpret the\nmodal condition fairly weakly, as saying simply that a really possible\nobject must be one that can have spatio-temporal structure (Gomes and\nStephenson 2016: \u00a73.4.1; Gr\u00fcne 2017a), and so the\n\u2018proof\u2019 provided through experience is compatible with the\nnon-actuality of the object of experience. According to this proposal,\nevery object of experience or intuition conforms to the conceptual\nformal conditions of experience, namely the categories, because every\nintuition is generated by a synthesis that takes place in accordance\nwith the categories. Thus, every intuition, regardless of whether the\nobject it represents is actual or not, conforms to the formal\nconditions of experience, and is therefore the representation of an\nobject that is really possible.\n\nMcLear (2016a) has argued against such a response in two ways. First,\nif the representations of space and time, as Intellectualism typically\nargues, are dependent on the intellect, then it is unclear how space\nand time operate as formal but \u201creal\u201d constraints,\nindependent of the intellect, on what is really possible. Second, any\nIntellectualist position that construes the modal condition as\nsatisfied merely by the formal conditions of experience commits itself\nto at least two problematic positions. First, imagined and\nhallucinated experiences will count as cognitions (cf. Beck 1978).\nSecond, Kant\u2019s emphasis on actuality in the Bxxvi note, quoted\nabove, is left unexplained.\n\nHowever, a corresponding challenge for the Sensibilist position lies\nin explaining how intuitions could be relations to actualities even in\nthe \u201cpure\u201d case of the intuitions of space and\ntime\u2014i.e., those a priori intuitions whose features are\ndescribed in their respective Metaphysical Expositions of space and\ntime in the Transcendental Aesthetic. Kant is quite clear that the\npure intuitions are intuitions of \u201cens\nimaginaria\u201d or imaginary beings (see Amphiboly, A291/B347).\nAs imaginary beings, they do not exist. If that is correct then it\ncannot be the case that intuition as such is existentially\ndependent on its relata, since a priori intuitions are certainly\nintuitions, and they lack existing relata. So it would seem that\neither it is false to construe intuitions as always relations to\nactualities or Kant is inconsistent in his treatment of intuition\nacross pure and empirical cases.\n\nHere, however, the Sensibilist can pursue a strategy of distinguishing\nactuality from existence (Stang 2016a: 34 and 322; McLear 2017: 91\nn10). Kant makes two explicit discussions of this point.\nFirst he is reported as having explicitly distinguished the concept of\nactuality (Wirklichkeit) from existence (Existenz)\nin a lecture from the mid 1790s (Metaphysik K3,\n29:986). Second, in reflexion R6324, 18:647 (between 1790 and\n1793), Kant specifically names time and space as actual but not\nexisting things.\n\nIf Sensibilism can make good on the plausibility of a distinction\nbetween actuality and existence then it can interpret all intuition as\na relation to an actuality, even if not always to an existent\nactuality, and thus give a straightforward explanation of why\nintuition in especially suited to satisfying the modal condition on\ncognition.\n",
