These groups may deny education to some of their\nmembers, advocate female genital mutilation, restrict religious\nfreedom, maintain an inequitable caste system, and so on. When, if\never, should a liberal group interfere with the internal governance of\nan illiberal group?\n\nSuppose first that the illiberal group is another political community\nor state. Can liberals intervene in the affairs of non-liberal states?\nMill provides a complicated answer in his 1859 essay \u2018A Few\nWords on Non-Intervention\u2019. Reiterating his claim from On\nLiberty that civilized and non-civilized countries are to be\ntreated differently, he insists that \u201cbarbarians have no rights\nas a nation, except a right to such treatment as may, at the\nearliest possible period, fit them for becoming one. The only moral\nlaws for the relation between a civilized and a barbarous government,\nare the universal rules of morality between man and man\u201d (1963,\nvol. 21: 119). Although this strikes us today as simply a case for an\nobjectionable paternalistic imperialism (and it certainly was such a\ncase), Mill\u2019s argument for the conclusion is more complex,\nincluding a claim that, since international morality depends on\nreciprocity, \u2018barbarous\u2019 governments that cannot be\ncounted on to engage in reciprocal behavior have no rights\nqua governments. In any event, when Mill turns to\ninterventions among \u2018civilized\u2019 peoples he develops an\naltogether more sophisticated account as to when one state can\nintervene in the affairs of another to protect liberal principles.\nHere Mill is generally against intervention. \u201cThe reason is,\nthat there can seldom be anything approaching to assurance that\nintervention, even if successful, would be for the good of the people\nthemselves. The only test possessing any real value, of a\npeople\u2019s having become fit for popular institutions, is that\nthey, or a sufficient proportion of them to prevail in the contest,\nare willing to brave labour and danger for their liberation\u201d\n(1963, vol. 21: 122).\n\nIn addition to questions of efficacy, to the extent that peoples or\ngroups have rights to collective self-determination, intervention by a\nliberal group to induce a non-liberal community to adopt liberal\nprinciples will be morally objectionable. As with individuals,\nliberals may think that peoples or groups have freedom to make\nmistakes in managing their collective affairs. If people\u2019s\nself-conceptions are based on their participation in such groups, even\nthose whose liberties are denied may object to, and perhaps in some\nway be harmed by, the imposition of liberal principles (Margalit and\nRaz, 1990; Tamir, 1993). Thus rather than proposing a doctrine of\nintervention, many liberals propose various principles of\ntoleration which specify to what extent liberals must\ntolerate non-liberal peoples and cultures. As is usual, Rawls\u2019s\ndiscussion is subtle and enlightening. In his account of the foreign\naffairs of liberal peoples, Rawls argues that liberal peoples must\ndistinguish \u2018decent\u2019 non-liberal societies from\n\u2018outlaw\u2019 and other states; the former have a claim on\nliberal peoples to tolerance while the latter do not (1999a:\n59\u201361). Decent peoples, argues Rawls, \u2018simply do not\ntolerate\u2019 outlaw states which ignore human rights: such states\nmay be subject to \u2018forceful sanctions and even to\nintervention\u2019 (1999a: 81). In contrast, Rawls insists that\n\u201cliberal peoples must try to encourage [non-liberal] decent\npeoples and not frustrate their vitality by coercively insisting that\nall societies be liberal\u201d (1999a: 62). Chandran Kukathas (2003)\n\u2014 whose liberalism derives from the classical tradition \u2014\nis inclined to almost complete toleration of non-liberal peoples, with\nthe non-trivial proviso that there must be exit rights.\n",
