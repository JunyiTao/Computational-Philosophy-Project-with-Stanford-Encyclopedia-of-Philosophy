    "main_text": "\n\nSimone de Beauvoir (1908\u20131986) was a philosopher, novelist,\nfeminist, public intellectual and activist, and one of the major\nfigures in existentialism in post-war France. She is best known for\nher trailblazing work in feminist philosophy, The Second Sex\n(1949), but her original contributions to existentialism and\nphenomenology can be found across her work, from her first\nphilosophical novel She Came to Stay (1943) to her\npoliticization of old age in The Coming of Age (1970).\nAlthough active in the French intellectual scene all of her life, and\na central player in the philosophical debates of the times both in her\nrole as an author of philosophical essays, novels, plays, memoirs,\ntravel diaries, and newspaper articles, and as an editor of the\nleftist journal Les Temps Modernes, Beauvoir was often\nregarded as merely the midwife to Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s existential\nethics rather than a thinker in her own right. She also, however,\nrefused to identify herself as a philosopher, referring to herself as\nan author in spite of her rigorous philosophical training and\naccomplishments. Yet, decades of scholarship on Beauvoir\u2019s life\nand work, undertaken predominantly by feminist scholars, secured for\nher a place in philosophy against her word, and for good reason.\nBeauvoir has made enduring contributions to the fields of ethics,\nsocial and political philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology and\nfeminist philosophy and her significance as an activist and public\nintellectual are clear. Beauvoir\u2019s life and work continue to\ninspire contemporary research and debate in the discipline of\nphilosophy and beyond.\n",
