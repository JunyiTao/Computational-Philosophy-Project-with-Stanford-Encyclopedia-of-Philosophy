    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nNicolaus Taurellus (Oechslein) was born on November 26, 1547 in\nMontb\u00e9liard/M\u00f6mpelgard into the family of a poor city\nclerk (for biographic information, see Baier 1728: 1\u201314; Bayle\n1730: vol. 4, p. 327; Schmid 1860: 1\u201322). At the time, the city\nwas politically affiliated with the duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg, and\npatronage by the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg allowed Taurellus to study\nphilosophy at the University of T\u00fcbingen with the eminent\nAristotelian logician and natural philosopher Jacob Schegk (on the\nintellectual scene in sixteenth-century T\u00fcbingen, see Methuen\n1998; on Schegk, see Kusukawa 1999). After completing his master of arts in philosophy (1565), he began\nto study theology but soon moved on to medicine and completed his\nmedical doctorate at the University of Basel (1570). In 1573, he\npublished his first and most comprehensive work in metaphysics,\nThe Triumph of Philosophy (PT), which pursued the plan to\nprovide a unified account of philosophical and theological truth and\nthereby to offer a philosophical defense of the doctrine of creation\n(PT: 220\u2013222, 250\u2013252; for overviews of Taurellus\u2019s\nmetaphysics, see Petersen 1921: 219\u2013258; Mayer 1959; Leinsle\n1985: 147\u2013165; Wollgast 1988: 148\u2013153). In spite of its\npious intention, and although it appeared with one of Europe\u2019s\nleading academic publishers of the time, the Henricpetri press, the\nwork was perceived as a provocation and, career-wise, initially turned\nout to be a failure.\n\nAfter several difficult years, Taurellus took up a professorship in\nethics at the University of Basel in 1579, and in 1580 he accepted a\nprofessorship in natural philosophy and medicine at the University of\nAltdorf, the university of the city of Nuremberg (on his activity at\nAltdorf, see Mayer 1960). In accordance with his teaching duties, he\npublished a massive volume on medical prognostics (Taurellus 1581) and\nan annotated edition of the works of the thirteenth-century physician\nArnaldus of Villanova (Arnaldus of Villanova 1585). He returned to\nphilosophy in 1586 with a critical commentary (VML) on\nAristotle\u2019s On Life and Death. In 1596 he published a\nshort overview and evaluation of Aristotelian metaphysics, followed in\nthe next year by a 1000-page response to the Averroistic philosophy of\nAndrea Cesalpino (1524/25\u20131603), whose work became influential\nat the University of Altdorf (see Mulsow 2004: 7\u20139). In a group\nof three last monographic works, Cosmology (1603 [KOS]),\nUranology (1603) and On the Eternity of Things (1604\n[DRA]), Taurellus gives detailed responses to central themes of late\nscholastic cosmology, especially as developed by the Paduan\nphilosopher Francesco Piccolomini (1520\u20131604). Also a 1604\ndissertation, On the Origin of Rational Souls (TRA), is\nmarked by its preface and references to earlier metaphysical works as\na text authored by Taurellus (which corresponds to academic practice\nin early modern Germany). Apart from his scholarly publications, he\nproduced two volumes of poetry (Taurellus 1592, 1595), one of which is\nregarded as a significant contribution to early modern emblematics\n(see Homann 1971: 105\u2013122). On September 28, 1606 Taurellus\nsuccumbed to the plague at the age of 58.\n",
