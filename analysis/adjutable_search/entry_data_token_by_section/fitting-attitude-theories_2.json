    "main_text": "Clarifying FA Theories: Some Choice Points || Which Normative Property?\n1.3 Which Normative Property?\n\nSo far, this entry has used the word \u2018fittingness\u2019 to pick\nout the normative property that FA theories appeal to in their\nexplanations of evaluative facts. The fittingness relation can be\nglossed as the relation in which a response stands to its object when\nthe object merits, or is worthy of, that response. Thus to say that\nsomething is a fitting object of admiration is to say that it merits\nadmiration, or is worthy of this attitude. Many FA theorists have held\nnot only that fittingness is the right normative relation to appeal to\nin explaining evaluative facts, but also that fittingness is\nexplanatorily fundamental relative to the rest of the normative domain\nsuch that all other normative facts can be explained in terms\nof it (Broad 1930; Ewing 1939, 1947; Chappell 2012; McHugh and Way\n2016; Howard 2019). But FA theorists needn\u2019t be committed to\neither of these claims. For instance, FA theorists might agree that\nevaluative facts should be explained in terms of facts about fitting\nresponses, but reject that fittingness is explanatorily fundamental\nrelative to the rest of the normative domain. Alternatively, they\nmight deny that fittingness is the right normative property to appeal\nto in explaining evaluative facts and opt instead to explain\nevaluative facts by appeal to facts involving a distinct normative\nproperty of responses. Other candidates for the normative property in\nquestion include a response\u2019s being such that one\n\u201cought\u201d to have it (Sidgwick 1874), its being\n\u201ccorrect\u201d (Brentano 1889/2009), \u201cjustified\u201d\n(Ewing 1959), \u201crational\u201d (Brandt 1979; Anderson 1993;\nSmith 1994), \u201crequired\u201d (Chisholm 1986; Lemos 1994),\n\u201cwarranted\u201d (Gibbard 1990), or its being such that\nthere\u2019s (some, sufficient, or decisive) \u201creason\u201d for\none to have it (Scanlon 1998; Schroeder 2010; Rowland 2019). The\ndebate among FA theorists concerning which normative property to\nappeal to in their theories continues today. Presently, the two most\npopular options are fittingness and reasons. For example, an FA\ntheorist who favors the latter option might claim that whenever\nsomething is valuable, that\u2019s fully\u00a0because there are\nreasons for anyone to value it (see section 1.5). Some costs and\nbenefits associated with the FA theorist\u2019s selection of either\nof these currently popular options are discussed in sections 2 and\n3.\n",
