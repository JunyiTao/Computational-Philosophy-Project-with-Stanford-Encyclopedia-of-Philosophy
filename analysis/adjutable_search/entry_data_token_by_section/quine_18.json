    "main_text": "Underdetermination of Theory by Evidence; Indeterminacy of Translation || Underdetermination\n6.1 Underdetermination\n\nThe basic idea of underdetermination is that two or more rival\ntheories might have all the same observational consequences, and thus\nbe empirically equivalent. Theory would thus be underdetermined by\nobservation. This might be held to call realism into question (as in\nvan Frassen 1980). Quine finds underdetermination harder to make sense\nof than might appear and, in any case, does not see a threat to\nrealism.\n\nIn Quine\u2019s idealized schematization of the relation between\ntheory and evidence, evidence for theory consists of observation\ncategoricals. (These latter can, in turn, be tested by observing or\ncontriving situations in which relevant observation sentences are\ntrue.) The case which most obviously poses a potential threat to\nrealism is that of a final global theory, a perfected and completed\nversion of our own. What if there are two or more such theories,\nequally simple, each of which implies all true observation\ncategoricals? (Note that the theory will not be implied by\nall the true observation categoricals; apart from other\nconsiderations, some sentences of the theory will essentially contain\nterms which do not occur in observation categoricals.)\n\nQuine is often thought to accept underdetermination. But in fact he\nholds that there is considerable difficulty in making non-trivial\nsense of the doctrine. He identifies theories with sets of sentences,\nnot with sets of sentence-meanings (propositions). So we can quite\ntrivially obtain an empirically equivalent alternative to any theory:\nsimply spell one of the theoretical terms differently at every\noccurrence. Strictly speaking, the result is a different set of\nsentences which implies all the same observation categoricals (1975a,\n319). The difference from the original theory, however, is merely\northographic; this possibility is clearly not of any philosophical\nsignificance.\n\nA closely related point can be made in terms of translation.\nTranslation of observation categoricals is quite unproblematic in\nprinciple. So we can count two theories as empirically equivalent not\nmerely if they imply the same observation categoricals but also if\nthey imply intertranslatable observation categoricals. So classical\nphysics as formulated in English (say) would, by this criterion, count\nas empirically equivalent to classical physics as formulated in\nGerman, yet the two formulations are, strictly speaking, different\ntheories. Quite generally, any theory is empirically equivalent to its\ntranslation into any other language. But this fact is also not of any\ngreat philosophical significance, and certainly poses no threat to\nrealism.\n\nIn order to threaten realism, a version of underdetermination would\nthus have to assert that our postulated complete global theory of the\nworld has empirically equivalent alternatives and that no translation\nfrom one theory to the other is possible. Since the predicates of the\ntheory are its only non-logical vocabulary, this is equivalent to\nsaying that we cannot obtain one from the other by reconstruing the\npredicates of the theory. Quine comments: \u201cThis, for me, is an\nopen question.\u201d (1975a, 327). Much of his subsequent discussion\nof underdetermination takes place in terms of the weaker idea that our\ntheory might have empirically equivalent alternatives and that\n\u201cwe would see no way of reconciling [them] by\nreconstrual of predicates\u201d (loc. cit, emphasis added;\ncf. also 1990a, 97).\n\nIf some version of underdetermination were true, how should we\nrespond? This is an issue on which Quine has not merely changed his\nmind but vacillated, going back and forth between what he calls the\n\u201csectarian\u201d and the \u201cecumenical\u201d responses.\nThe sectarian response is to say that we should not let the existence\nof the alternative in any way affect our attitude towards our own\ntheory: we should continue to take it seriously, as uniquely telling\nus the truth about the world. (We are assuming that the two theories\npossess all theoretical virtues to equal degree; clearly Quine would\nsay that if one theory were superior in some way then we would have\nreason to adopt it.) The ecumenical response, by contrast, counts both\ntheories as true. In almost his last word on the subject he suggests\nthat there may be little at stake since the \u201cfantasy of\nirresolubly rival systems of the world\u201d takes us \u201cout\nbeyond where linguistic usage has been crystallized by use\u201d\n(1990a, 100f).\n\nQuine can afford to vacillate because, in his view, nothing very much\nturns on the issue. In particular, he never holds that\nunderdetermination, in any version, would threaten realism; at no time\ndoes he suggest that it casts doubt on the truth of our theory. That\nis not what is in question between the sectarian and the ecumenical\npositions; all that is in question is whether the alternative theory\nshould also be counted as true. Nor is this surprising. The\nterms in which underdetermination is stated, such as observation\ncategoricals, are part of our theory, as would be the demonstration\nthat another theory was empirically equivalent. The point here is the\nnaturalism which we have emphasized throughout. Nothing in our\nepistemology pronounces on the status of theory from an independent\nstandpoint; to the contrary: it presupposes the truth of our theory.\nThis central idea is not cast in doubt by underdetermination.
