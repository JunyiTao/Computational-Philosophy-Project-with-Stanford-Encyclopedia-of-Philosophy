The realization of such regularity has\ntherefore been preconditioned by language which was intended to\nprovide a formal framework for social understanding. The\nstandardization of language (and thus of cognitively reflected\nperception) had to be realized in accordance with the structural\nregularity of existence. According to most scholars, the elementary\ncategorization which defined the essential and formal assumptions of\nclassical Chinese epistemologies was therefore closely connected to\nissues concerning the regulation of the relationship between the\nstructure of language and reality. This categorization has been\nexpressed in the bipolar complementary relationship between names or\nconcepts (ming \u540d) and actualities (shi\n\u5be6).\n\nThe Confucian glorification of the perfect, harmonious and utopian\nsociety of the past was also reflected in the discourse on Proper\nNames (Lunyu CTP: Zi lu, 3), which envisioned a society\nin which everyone lived in accordance with the original meaning of\nthat which expressed their social position. According to this\napproach, words in ideal, past society incorporated the core of the\nrealities denoted by them, while the crisis of the Warring States\nperiod (475\u2013221 BC) emerged from the growing discrepancies\nbetween the names (social positions) of individuals and their actual\nbehavior. The ideal conditions for society could therefore only be\nestablished when everyone acted in accordance with their (social) name\n(Lunyu CTP: Yanyuan, 11).\n\nIn contrast to Confucius, Mo Di (ca 650\u2013200 BC), the founder of\nthe Mohist school, questioned the existence of an ideal language (the\nessence of the notion ming) to which (external) reality and\nsociety had to adapt. Instead of shaping social interactions according\nto language standards, which Confucians viewed as incorporating the\nessential structure of natural order and humaneness, the Mohists\nadopted the opposite approach, arguing that since language was a means\nfor transmitting realities, it was language which had to adjust to\nsuch realities and not vice-versa. According to Mo Di, the criteria\nfor such adjustment had to be based on actual social needs, and not on\nthe idealized and alien models of a bygone era.\n\nHowever, in both cases, the realization of a regulation that could\nprovide a framework for a social understanding needed to be\npreconditioned by the standardization of language, which is a possible\nfactor in the problem of the relation between actualities\n(shi) and proper naming (ming) became the basic\nepistemological question in ancient China. Naturally, the question as\nregards the normative criteria for such a relational structure arose\nat the very outset of this approach. The standardization or\ncontinuation (chang \u5e38) of language had to be carried\nout in accordance with the formal premises of a binary structured\n(shi \u662f : fei \u975e) valuation\n(bian \u8fa8). Only when these conditions were met, was it\npossible to achieve the ultimate goal of pragmatically oriented\nepistemology in classical Chinese discourses: every linguistic\nexpression, every name (ming) could (and should) therefore be\napplied in accordance to the principles that determined actuality\n(shi).\n\nThe adherents of the School of Names (ming jia\n\u540d\u5bb6) believed that, with respect to the concrete\nsituation to which language has been applied, each single thing could\nhave a single meaning. Gongsun Long (ca\u2009325\u2013250 BC)\nunderstood this in a way in which mutual coverings of meanings could\nonly exist on an abstract level. He attempted to eliminate semantic\noverlapping, or at least to reduce it to a level on which language\ncould still be overseen and controlled.\n\nHowever, according to the Neo-Mohist school the semantic overlapping\nof different terms was a natural quality of human language which meant\nthat the Neo-Mohist philosophers saw no need to eliminate it. They\nwere far more interested in the question of language as a means for\ncategorizing the natural and social worlds.\n\nSemantic approaches occupied a privileged position within these models\nof thought. These proto-epistemological discourses would have a\ndecisive impact on later developments in this specific area, most of\nwhich took place between 2nd and 6th centuries\nAD. This epistemological shift followed the debate on the nature of\nthe relation between names (or concepts) and realities (ming\nand shi), which was later essentially upgraded within\nthe so-called Neo-Daoist discourses on the relation between language\nand meaning (yan yi \u8a00\u610f), i.e., between\ncom\u00adpre\u00adhen\u00adsion and interpretation. However, these philosophers of the\nWei Jin era (265\u2013420) also began to investigate the structure of\nmeaning in a way that was no longer limited to the sphere of the\nconcrete, existing, objective, external actuality (Tang 1955: 68). The\nfocus of the scholars from this period was no longer limited to\nresponding to the questions concerning \u201cproper\u201d behavior,\ni.e., \u201cproper\u201d rituals, or formulating wise maxims that\ninspired people to a wiser, more ethical life, leading to a more\nharmonious society. Instead, they were interested in the question of\nexpressions and in investigating the relations between these maxims or\nsayings and the reality to which they referred. This meant determining\nwhich names were suitable for denoting certain things and which were\nnot and, conversely, which sort of realities could be designated by\ncertain names, and which could not. Based on these investigations,\nthey tried to establish a system, based on the semantic structure of\nnames (mingli lun \u540d\u7406\u8ad6, see Tang 1955:\n66) that divided specific concepts from one another, in order to be\nable to identify the errors and misapprehensions that resulted from\nthe improper use of names. In effect, these scholars discovered the\nepistemological dimension of meta-language, which was certainly a\nhigher level of thought than that of simple teachings that merely\nimplied direct and one-dimensional reasoning about things and the\nexternal reality. According to Tang Junyi (1955: 66), teachings\nformulated at this level were more abstract and belonged to higher\ncognitive levels. They were teachings about \u201chow teachings were\nmade\u201d. The principles derived from them were principles of\n\u201chow principles were established\u201d. This new dimension, in\nturn, would lead them to analyze the relation between human reasoning\nand their own cognitive concepts and, ultimately, these concepts as\nsuch.\n\nIn later, pre-modern critical approaches to philosophical thought, it\nwas exposed that even though names do not comprise the meanings of an\noriginal Heavenly essence, they should not be regarded as arbitrary;\nthe naming of reality has to be performed in accordance with the\nobjective and generally valid principles. The prime innovation in this\nregard was Dai Zhen\u2019s (1724\u20131777) emphasis on the concept\nof the \u201cexhaustive comprehension of concrete facts (actualities)\n(jinqi shi \u76e1\u5176\u5be6)\u201d per\u00adtain\u00ading to the\nreality we seek to comprehend (Xia 1996b: 417).\n",
