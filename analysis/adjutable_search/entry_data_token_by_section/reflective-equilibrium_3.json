    "main_text": "Judgments || The Epistemic Constraint\n1.3 The Epistemic Constraint\n\nConsidered judgments, even those that satisfy the confidence\nconstraint, are not limited as to their content. One might have the\nability, opportunity, and desire to make the right decision, yet make\na grossly mistaken decision, and be confident in it (see Sternberg\n[ed.] 2002). This may motivate an epistemic constraint. A\nmodest version would exclude judgments that are logically inconsistent\nor founded on empirical error. A more ambitious constraint excludes\nany unjustified or unwarranted beliefs (Kelly & McGrath 2010). For\nexample, Gerald Gaus comments that \u201cclearly unjustified beliefs\nare, if anything, epistemic liabilities,\u201d approvingly quoting\nQuine and Ullian\u2019s suggestion that \u201cinsofar as we are\nrational, we will drop a belief when we have in vain tried to find\nevidence for it\u201d (Gaus 1996: 86; Quine & Ullian 1970:\n16).\n\nFriends of reflective equilibrium largely reject such a constraint.\nThe basic complaint is that it makes epistemological determinations in\nadvance of the reflective process where these are rather the proper\nupshot of that process. Reflective equilibrium can be viewed as a\nnegative method, i.e., as what we\u2019re left with when we decide\nthat positive criteria for epistemic success cannot be laid out prior\nto fully considering our substantive topics (Walden 2013: 255). On\nthis view, what counts as justification, warrant, or consistency\nshould be decided with all relevant theory on the table as part of the\nprocess of reflective equilibrium and is not prescribed by the method\nitself.\n",
