Summary\n\n\nImprecise probabilities offer a model of rational belief that does\naway with some of the idealisation required by the orthodox precise\nprobability approach. Many motivations for such a move have been put\nforward, and many views on IP have been discussed. There are still\nseveral open philosophical questions relating to IP, and this is\nlikely to be a rich field of research for years to come.\n",
