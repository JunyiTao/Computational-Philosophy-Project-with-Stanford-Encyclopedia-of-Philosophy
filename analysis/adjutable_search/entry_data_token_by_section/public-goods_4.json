    "main_text": "Defining Public Goods and Distinguishing Between Different Kinds of Public Goods || An Alternative Definition\n1.5 An Alternative Definition\n\nAngela Kallhoff has offered an alternative, albeit similar, definition\nof a public good (Kallhoff 2011: Ch. 2). According to her, a public\ngood is one that satisfies the \u201cbasic availability\ncondition\u201d and the \u201copen access condition\u201d. Basic\navailability is her analogue of non-rivalry. A good satisfies this\ncondition whenever each person benefitting from it has access to the\nsame amount and the same types of benefits. To state the condition in\nthese terms makes explicit that there may exist a level of consumption\nat which sameness of amount and types of benefit are no longer\nguaranteed. A single ship\u2019s enjoying the benefits of a\nlighthouse does not affect another ship\u2019s doing the same but\nonce the sea is congested this may no longer be the case. A lighthouse\nis a public good because there exists a level at which each\nperson has access to the same amount and the same types of benefits.\nOpen access is Kallhoff\u2019s analogue of non-excludability. It\nstates that \n\n\nentrance barriers that regulate access to a good are not combined with\ncriteria which define a list of potential beneficiaries and exclude\nothers. (Kallhoff 2011: 43) \n\n\nClubs produce services for a specific group of beneficiaries, the club\nmembers. In order to profit from a lighthouse, an individual needs a\nboat and a desire to travel to the coast where the lighthouse is\nlocated but there is no pre-specified collective that constitutes the\nintended beneficiaries of this good.\n",
