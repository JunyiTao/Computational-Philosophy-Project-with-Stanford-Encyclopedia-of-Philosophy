Is presentism compatible with that claim? How\nshould we interpret the semantics? At no point in history were there\nall seven Kings; the Edwards weren\u2019t contemporaneous. But, if\nthe Edwards didn\u2019t all exist together, then how can <There\nhave been 7 English Kings called \u201cEdward\u201d> be true?\nPresentism faces a novel problem regarding truths about the past when\nsuch truths concern \u201cspans\u201d of time (see Lewis 2004).\nAfter all, the natural reading is false: it was the case that\n\u201cthere are 7 English Kings called\n\u2018Edward\u2019\u201d.\n\nTwo routes suggest themselves as plausible avenues to explore. The\nfirst is to try to make sense of talk of spans by using talk of\nindividual times. Following the literature, call these \u201cslice\noperators\u201d. The idea, then, is that we say that\n\n\nIt WAS the case that [\u201c<There is a King called\nEdward>, and it WAS the case that [<There is a King\ncalled Edward>, and\u2026.]]\u201d\n\n\nSomewhat loosely, we can describe this as analyzing the span in terms\nof the individual \u201cslices\u201d that would make it up, were\nsuch a thing as a \u201cspan\u201d to exist.\n\nThere are many difficulties with this kind of approach. The most\nobvious challenge is that, in the above, the second iteration of our\ntense operator, \u201cWAS\u201d appears within the scope of the\nfirst. Thus, the attempted paraphrase of <There have been 7 English\nKings called \u201cEdward\u201d> is a sentence of the form\n\u201cthere has been a king called \u2018Edward\u2019, and there\nhad been a king called \u2018Edward\u2019\u2026\u201d. For one\nthing, however, suppose that there have been infinitely many entities\nin the past. Kings will not be a useful candidate here, so imagine\ninstead that there have been infinitely many electrons. Hence,\n<There have been infinitely many electrons> is true. But this\nrequires a construction with an infinite number of nested quantifiers\nand tense operators. This won\u2019t do, for no such construction can\nbe generated, despite the fact that we clearly can utter a\nsentence that expresses the relevant proposition, \u201cthere have\nbeen infinitely many electrons\u201d.\n\nAnother important problem for the translation approach is that there\nseem to be cases in which the paraphrase is false and yet the\nparaphrased sentence is true. Consider a merely possible case in which\nsome of the past Kings were instantaneous and simultaneous. (If this\nis too implausible in the case of Kings, given facts about royal\nsuccession, then swap the case for one involving physical particles\nwhich can be instantaneous and simultaneous.)\n\nThe second route sees us endorsing a primitive \u201cspan\u201d\noperator, an operator that picks out temporal intervals rather than\nindividual moments (see Lewis 2004: 12). Rather than try to analyze\nthe span in terms of slices, this approach sees us just endorsing a\nspan operator as a primitive piece of terminology. Berit Brogaard\n(2007) introduces this strategy neatly, as follows:\n\n\nWhere the usual slice operators mean (as the eternalist would put it)\n\u201cat some past (or future) moment\u201d, a span operator means\n\u201cat some past (or future) interval\u201d ([Lewis] 2004: 12).\nThus, where \u201cit HAS been that\u201d is the past-tense span\noperator, Lewis suggests that we translate \u201cthere have been two\nkings named Charles\u201d as \u201cit HAS been that (there are two\nkings named Charles)\u201d. By eternalist lights, this means that\n\u201cit is true of some interval in the past that there are two\nkings named Charles\u201d ([Lewis] 2004: 12). The presentist, of\ncourse, cannot accept this translation, but must presumably treat span\noperators as primitives. (2007: 73)\n\n\nThere are also problems with this route. First, it seems that such\nspan operators introduce ambiguities. Let\u2019s introduce the span\noperator \u201cHAS\u201d as the operator \u201cit has been the case\nthat\u2026\u201d and consider a target sentence, \u201cfirst it\nwas raining and then the sun shone\u201d. Then, suppose that we\nparaphrase this as: \u201cHAS (it is raining and the sun is\nshining)\u201d. This is problematically ambiguous. The paraphrase\nmight mean that there has been an interval of time throughout which it\nhas both been the case that the sun has shone and it has rained. Or,\nit might mean that there is an interval of time, throughout a\nsub-interval of which the sun shone and throughout another\nsub-interval of which it rained. Clearly, we want the latter; but with\nHAS, at least as stated, we have no means of differentiating the two.\nIf the semantics of the span operator are ambiguous, then it\ndoesn\u2019t give us a sensible semantics for span-talk (cf. Tallant\n& Ingram 2020).\n\nAs should be clear, merely solving the truth-maker objection\ndoesn\u2019t automatically address this problem of spans. The\ntruth-maker objection rests upon the fact that presentists apparently\nlack the ontological resources required to accommodate truth-making.\nThe span objection rests upon the fact that, given presentism, it is\nfar from clear how to provide an adequate regimentation of the\nsemantics of ordinary language. Bringing together an adequate\nsemantics as well as an adequate ontology is no easy task.\n",
