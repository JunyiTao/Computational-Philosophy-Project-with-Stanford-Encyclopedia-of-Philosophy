    "main_text": "\n1. Value problems\n\nIn Plato\u2019s Meno, Socrates raises the question of why\nknowledge is more valuable than mere true belief. Call this the\nMeno problem or, anticipating distinctions made below, the\nprimary value problem.\n\nInitially, we might appeal to the fact that knowledge appears to be of\nmore practical use than true belief in order to mark this difference\nin value. But, as Socrates notes, this could be questioned, because a\ntrue belief that this is the way to Larissa will get you to\nLarissa just as well as knowledge that this is the way to\nLarissa. Plato\u2019s own solution was that knowledge is formed\nin a special way distinguishing it from belief: knowledge, unlike\nbelief, must be \u2018tied down\u2019 to the truth, like the\nmythical tethered statues of Daedalus. As a result, knowledge is\nbetter suited to guide action. For example, if one knows, rather than\nmerely truly believes, that this is the way to Larissa, then one might\nbe less likely to be perturbed by the fact that the road initially\nseems to be going in the wrong direction. Mere true belief at this\npoint might be lost, since one might lose all confidence that this is\nthe right way to go.\n\nThe primary value problem has been distinguished from the\nsecondary value problem (Pritchard 2007: \u00a72). The\nsecondary value problem pertains to why knowledge is more valuable,\nfrom an epistemic point of view, than any proper subset of\nits parts. Put otherwise, why is knowledge better than any epistemic\nstanding falling short of knowing? This includes, but is not\nrestricted to, mere true belief. To illustrate the distinction,\nconsider a possible solution to the primary value problem: knowledge\nis justified true belief, and justified true belief is better than\nmere true belief, which explains why knowledge is better than true\nbelief. If correct, this hypothesis successfully answers the primary\nvalue problem. However, it requires further development to answer the\nsecondary value problem. For example, it requires further development\nto explain why knowledge is better than justified belief.\n\nOf course, on many standard theories of knowledge, knowledge is not\ndefined as justified true belief. For instance, according to some\ntheorists, knowledge is undefeated justified true belief (Lehrer &\nPaxson 1969); on other widely discussed accounts, knowledge is true\nbelief that is non-accidental (Unger 1968), sensitive (Nozick 1981),\nsafe (Sosa 1999), appropriately caused (Goldman 1967), or produced by\nintellectual virtue (Zagzebski 1996). This puts us in a position to\nappreciate what some theorists call the tertiary value\nproblem. The tertiary value problem pertains to why knowledge is\nqualitatively better than any epistemic standing falling\nshort of knowledge. Consider that if knowledge were only\nquantitatively better than that which falls just short\u2014for\ninstance, on an envisioned continuum of epistemic value\u2014then it\nwould be mysterious why epistemologists have given such attention to\nthis particular point on the continuum.\n\nWhy does knowledge have this \u201cdistinctive value\u201d not\nshared by that which falls just short of knowledge (Pritchard 2009:\n14)?\n\nNot all theorists accept that the value problems are genuine. For\nexample, in light of the literature on the Gettier problem, some\ntheorists deny that the secondary value problem is genuine. On this\napproach, whatever is added to justified true belief to rule out\nGettier cases does not increase the value of the agent\u2019s\nintellectual state: it is of no consequence whether we have\nGettier-proof justified true belief rather than mere justified true\nbelief (Kaplan 1985). Of course, Gettier cases are peculiar and\npresumably rare, so in practice having Gettier-proof justified true\nbelief is almost invariably confounded with having mere justified true\nbelief. This could lead some theorists to mistake the value of the\nlatter for that of the former. Other theorists deny that the primary\nvalue problem is genuine. For example, on one approach, knowledge just\nis true belief (Sartwell 1991). If knowledge is true belief, then\nknowledge cannot be better than true belief, because nothing can be\nbetter than itself. However, the definition of knowledge as true\nbelief has not been widely accepted.\n2. Reliabilism and the Meno Problem\n\nThe first contemporary wave of work on the value problem largely\nconcerned whether this problem raised a distinctive difficulty for\nreliabilist accounts of knowledge\u2014i.e., those views which\nessentially define knowledge as reliably-formed true belief. In\nparticular, the claim was that reliabilism was unable to offer an\nanswer even to the primary value problem.\n\nA fairly clear statement of what is at issue here is given in a number\nof places by Linda Zagzebski (e.g., 2003a; cf. DePaul 1993; Zagzebski\n1996; Jones 1997; Swinburne 1999, 2000; Riggs 2002a; Kvanvig 2003;\nSosa 2007: ch. 4; Carter & Jarvis 2012). To begin with, Zagzebski\nargues that the reliability of the process by which something is\nproduced does not automatically add value to that thing, and thus that\nit cannot be assumed that the reliability of the process by which a\ntrue belief is produced will add value to that true belief. In defense\nof this claim, she offers the analogy of a cup of coffee. She claims\nthat a good cup of coffee which is produced by a reliable coffee\nmachine\u2014i.e., one that regularly produces good cups of\ncoffee\u2014is of no more value than an equally good cup of coffee\nthat is produced by an unreliable coffee machine.\n\nFurthermore, as this line of objection goes, true belief is in the\nrelevant respects like coffee: a true belief formed via a reliable\nbelief-forming process is no more valuable than a true belief formed\nvia an unreliable belief-forming process. In both cases, the value of\nthe reliability of the process accrues in virtue of its tendency to\nproduce a certain valuable effect (good coffee/true belief), but this\nmeans that where the effect has been produced\u2014where one has a\ngood cup of coffee or a true belief\u2014then the value of the\nproduct is no greater for having been produced in a reliable way.\n\nElsewhere in the literature (e.g., Kvanvig 2003), this problem has\nbeen called the \u201cswamping problem\u201d, on account of how the\nvalue of true belief \u2018swamps\u2019 the value of the true belief\nbeing produced in a reliable (i.e., truth-conducive) way. So\nexpressed, the moral of the problem seems to be that where\nreliabilists go awry is by treating the value of the process as being\nsolely captured by the reliability of the process\u2014i.e., its\ntendency to produce the desired effect. Since the value of the effect\nswamps the value of the reliability of the process by which the effect\nwas achieved, this means that reliabilism has no resources available\nto it to explain why knowledge is more valuable than true belief.\n\nIt\u2019s actually not clear that this is a problem that is specific\nto reliabilism. That is, it seems that if this is a bona fide\nproblem, then it will affect any account of the value of knowledge\nwhich has the same relevant features as reliabilism\u2014i.e., which\nregards the greater value of knowledge over true belief as\ninstrumental value, where the instrumental value in question is\nrelative to the valuable good of true belief. In particular, it will\naffect veritist proposals about epistemic value which treat\ntruth as the fundamental epistemic good.\u00a0See\u00a0Kvanvig (2003:\nCh. 3)\u00a0for discussion of how internalist approaches to epistemic\njustification interface with the swamping problem;\u00a0see Pettigrew\n(2018) and Pritchard (2019) for responses to the swamping argument on\nbehalf of the veritist.\n\nFurthermore, as J. Adam Carter and Benjamin Jarvis (2012) have argued,\nthere are reasons to be suspicious of a key premise driving the\nswamping argument. The premise in question, which has been referred to\nas the \u201cSwamping Thesis\u201d (Pritchard 2011), states that if\nthe value of a property possessed by an item is instrumentally\nvaluable only relative to a further good, and that good is already\npresent in that item, then it can confer no additional value. Carter\nand Jarvis contend that one who embraces the Swamping Thesis should\nalso, by parity of reasoning, embrace a corollary thesis which they\ncall the Swamping Thesis Complement, according to which, if the value\nof a property possessed by an item is instrumentally valuable only\nrelative to a further good, and that good has already failed\nto be present in that item, then it can confer no additional value.\nHowever, as they argue, the Swamping Thesis and the Swamping Thesis\nComplement, along with other plausible premises, jointly entail the\nunpalatable conclusion that non-factive epistemic\nproperties\u2014most notably, justification\u2014are never\nepistemically valuable properties of a belief. See Dutant (2013) and\nBjelde (2020) for critical responses to Carter and Jarvis\u2019 line\nof reasoning and Sylvan (2018) for a separate challenge to the\nswamping argument, which rejects its tacit commitment to epistemic\ninstrumentalism (cf., Bjelde 2020). For an overview of the key moves\nof the argument, see Pritchard (2011).\n\nHowever, even granting the main elements of the swamping argument,\nthere are moves that the reliabilist can make in response (see, e.g.,\nGoldman & Olsson 2009; Olsson 2011; Bates 2013; Roush 2010; cf.\nBrown 2012; Davis, & J\u00e4ger 2012; Hovarth 2009; Piller 2009).\nFor example, it is surely open to the reliabilist to argue that the\ngreater instrumental value of reliable true belief over mere true\nbelief does not need to be understood purely in terms of instrumental\nvalue relative to the good of true belief. There could, for instance,\nbe all sorts of practical benefits of having a reliable true\nbelief which generate instrumental value. Indeed, it is worth noting\nthat the line of response to the Meno problem sketched by\nPlato, which we noted above, seems to specifically appeal to the\ngreater practical instrumental value of knowledge over mere true\nbelief.\n\nMoreover, there is reason to think that this objection will only at\nbest have an impact on process reliabilist\nproposals\u2014i.e., those views that treat all reliable\nbelief-forming processes as conferring a positive epistemic standing\non the beliefs so formed. For example, agent reliabilism\n(e.g., Greco 1999, 2000) might be thought to be untouched by this sort\nof argument. This is because, according to agent reliabilism, it is\nnot any sort of reliable process that confers positive epistemic\nstatus to belief, but only those processes that are stable features of\nthe agent\u2019s \u201ccognitive character\u201d. The main\nmotivation for this restriction on reliable processes is that it\nexcludes certain kinds of reliable but nonetheless strange and\nfleeting processes which notoriously cause problems for the view (such\nas processes where the reliability is due to some quirk in the\nsubject\u2019s environment, rather than because of any cognitive\ntrait possessed by the agent herself). Plausibly, however, one might\nargue that the reliable traits that make up an agent\u2019s cognitive\ncharacter have some value independently of the instrumental value they\npossess in virtue of being reliable\u2014i.e., that they have some\nfinal or intrinsic value. If this is right, then this opens up the\npossibility that agent-reliabilists can evade the problem noted for\npure reliabilists.\n\nZagzebski\u2019s diagnosis of what is motivating this problem for\nreliabilism seems, however, explicitly to exclude\nsuch a counter-response. She argues that what gives rise to this\ndifficulty is the fact that the reliabilist has signed up to a\n\u201cmachine-product model of belief\u201d\u2014see especially,\nZagzebski (2003a)\u2014where the product is external to the cause. It\nis not clear what exactly Zagzebski means by this point, but she\nthinks it shows that even where the reliable process is independently\nvaluable\u2014i.e., independently of its being reliable\u2014it\nstill doesn\u2019t follow that the value of the cause will transfer\nto add value to the effect. Here again the coffee analogy is appealed\nto: even if a reliable coffee machine were independently valuable, it\nwould not thereby confer additional value on a good cup of coffee.\n\nPerhaps the best way to evaluate the above line of argument is to\nconsider what is required in order to resolve the problem it\nposes. Perhaps what is needed is an \u2018internal\u2019 connection\nbetween product and cause, such as the kind of internal connection\nthat exists between an act and its motive which is highlighted by how\nwe explicitly evaluate actions in terms of the motives that led to\nthem (Zagzebski 2003a). On this picture, then, we are not to\nunderstand knowledge as a state consisting of a known belief, but\nrather as a state which consists of both the true belief and\nthe source from which that true belief was acquired. In short, then,\nthe problem with the machine-product model of belief is that it leads\nus to evaluate the state of the knowledge independently of the means\nby which the knowledge was acquired. If, in contrast, we have a\nconception of knowledge that incorporates into the very state of\nknowledge the way that the knowledge was acquired, we can avoid this\nproblem.\n\nOnce one effects this transition away from the machine-product model\nof belief, one can allow that the independent value of the reliable\nprocess can ensure that knowledge, by being produced in this way, is\nmore valuable than mere true belief (Zagzebski 2003a). In particular,\nif the process by which one gained the true belief is an epistemic\nvirtue\u2014a character trait which is both reliable and\nintrinsically valuable\u2014then this can ensure that the value of\nthe knowing state in this case is more valuable than any corresponding\nstate which simply consisted of a true belief.\n\nOther commentators in the virtue epistemology camp, broadly conceived,\nhave put forward similar suggestions. For example, Wayne Riggs (2002a)\nand Greco (e.g., 2003) have argued for a \u2018credit\u2019 version\nof virtue epistemology, according to which the agent, in virtue of\nbringing about the positively valuable outcome of a true belief, is\ndue credit as a result. Rather than treating the extra value of\nknowledge over true belief as deriving simply from the agent\u2019s\nattainment of the target true belief, however, Riggs and Greco instead\nargue that we should regard the agent\u2019s knowing as the state the\nagent is in when she is responsible for her true belief. Only in so\ndoing, they claim, can we answer the value problem. Jason Baehr\n(2012), by contrast with Riggs and Greco, has argued that credit\ntheories of knowledge do not answer the value problem but, rather,\n\u2018provide grounds for denying\u2019 (2012: 1) that knowledge has\nvalue over and above the value of true belief.\n\nInterestingly, however, other virtue epistemologists, most notably\nErnest Sosa (2003), have also advocated a \u2018credit\u2019 view,\nyet seem to stay within the machine-product picture of belief. That\nis, rather than analyze the state of knowing as consisting of both the\ntrue belief and its source, they regard the state of knowing as\ndistinct from the process, yet treat the fact that the process is\nintrinsically valuable as conferring additional value on any true\nbelief so produced. With Sosa\u2019s view in mind, it is interesting\nto ask just why we need to analyze knowledge in the way that Zagzebski\nand others suggest in order to get around the value problem.\n\nThe most direct way to approach this question is by considering\nwhether it is really true that a valuable cause cannot confer value on\nits effect where cause and effect are kept separate in the way that\nZagzebski claims is problematic in the case of knowledge. One\ncommentator who has objected to Zagzebski\u2019s argument by querying\nthis claim on her part is Berit Brogaard (2007; cf. Percival 2003;\nPritchard 2007: \u00a72), who claims that a valuable cause can indeed\nconfer value on its effect in the relevant cases. Brogaard claims that\nvirtue epistemologists like Zagzebski and Riggs endorse this claim\nbecause they adhere to what she calls a \u201cMoorean\u201d\nconception of value, on which if two things have the same intrinsic\nproperties, then they are equally valuable. Accordingly, if true\nbelief and knowledge have the same intrinsic properties (which is what\nwould be the case on the view of knowledge that they reject), it\nfollows that they must have the same value. Hence, it is crucial to\nunderstand knowledge as having distinct intrinsic properties from true\nbelief before one can hope to resolve the value problem.\n\nIf one holds that there is only intrinsic and instrumental value, then\nthis conception of value is compelling, since objects with the same\nintrinsic properties trivially have the same amount of intrinsic\nvalue, and they also plausibly have the same amount of instrumental\nvalue as well (at least in the same sort of environment). However, the\nMoorean conception of value is problematic because\u2014as Wlodek\nRabinowicz & Toni R\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen (1999, 2003) have\npointed out\u2014there seem to be objects which we value for their\nown sake but whose value derives from their being extrinsically\nrelated to something else that we value. That is, such objects are\nfinally\u2014i.e., non-instrumentally\u2014valuable without\nthereby being intrinsically valuable. For criticism of this account of\nfinal value, see Bradley (2002).\n\nThe standard example in this regard is Princess Diana\u2019s dress.\nThis would be regarded as more valuable than an exact replica simply\nbecause it belonged to Diana, which is clearly an extrinsic property\nof the object. Even though the extra value that accrues to the object\nis due to its extrinsic properties, however, it is still the case that\nthis dress is (properly) valued for its own sake, and thus valued\nnon-instrumentally.\n\nGiven that value of this sort is possible, then it follows that it\ncould well be the case that we value one true belief over another\nbecause of its extrinsic features\u2014i.e., that the one true\nbelief, but not the other, was produced by a reliable cognitive trait\nthat is independently valuable. For example, it could be that we value\nforming a true belief via a reliable cognitive trait more than a mere\ntrue belief because the former belief is produced in such a way that\nit is of credit to us that we believe the truth. There is thus a\ncrucial lacuna in Zagzebski\u2019s argument.\n\nA different response to the challenge that Zagzebski raises for\nreliabilism is given by Michael Brady (2006). In defense of\nreliabilism, Brady appeals to the idea that to be valuable is to be a\nfitting or appropriate object of positive evaluative attitudes, such\nas admiration or love (e.g., Brentano 1889 [1969]; Chisholm 1986;\nWiggins 1987; Gibbard 1990; Scanlon 1998). That one object is more\nvaluable than another is thus to be understood, on this view, in terms\nof the fact that that object is more worthy of positive evaluation.\nThus, the value problem for reliabilism on this conception of value\ncomes down to the question why knowledge is more worthy of positive\nevaluation on this view than mere true belief. Brady\u2019s\ncontention is that, at least within this axiological framework, it\nis possible for the reliabilist to offer a compelling story\nabout why reliable true belief\u2014and thus knowledge\u2014is more\nvaluable than mere true belief.\n\nCentral to Brady\u2019s argument is his claim that there are many\nways one can positively evaluate something, and thus many different\nways something can be valuable. Moreover, Brady argues that we can\ndistinguish active from passive evaluative\nattributes, where the former class of attitudes involve pursuit of the\ngood in question. For example, one might actively value the truth,\nwhere this involves, for instance, a striving to discover the truth.\nIn contrast, one might at other times merely passively value the\ntruth, such as simply respecting or contemplating it.\n\nWith this point in mind, Brady\u2019s central thesis is that on the\nreliabilist account knowledge is more valuable than true belief\nbecause certain active positive evaluative attitudes are fitting only\nwith regard to the former (i.e., reliable true belief). In particular,\ngiven its intrinsic features, reliable true belief is worthy of active\nlove, whereas an active love of unreliable (i.e., accidental) true\nbelief because of its intrinsic features would be entirely\ninappropriate because there is nothing that we can do to attain\nunreliable true belief that wouldn\u2019t conflict with love of\ntruth.\n\nThis is an intriguing proposal, which opens up a possible avenue of\ndefense against the kind of machine-product objection to reliabilism\nconsidered. One problem that such a move faces, however, is that it is\nunclear whether we can make sense of the distinction Brady draws\nbetween active and passive evaluative attitudes, at least in the\nepistemic sphere. When Brady talks of passive evaluative attitudes\ntowards the truth, he gives examples like contemplating, accepting,\nembracing, affirming, and respecting. Some of these attitudes are not\nclearly positive evaluative attitudes, however. Moreover, some of them\nare not obviously passive either. For example, is to contemplate the\ntruth really to evaluate it positively, rather than simply to\nconsider it? Furthermore, in accepting, affirming or embracing the\ntruth, isn\u2019t one actively positively evaluating the\ntruth? Wouldn\u2019t such evaluative attitudes manifest themselves in\nthe kind of practical action that Brady thinks is the mark of active\nevaluative attitudes? More needs to be said about this distinction\nbefore it can do the philosophical work that Brady has in mind.\n\nA further, albeit unorthodox, recent approach to the swamping problem\nis due to Carter and Rupert (2020). Carter and Rupert point out that\nextant approaches to the swamping problem suppose that if a solution\nis to be found, it will be at the personal level of description, the\nlevel at which states of subjects or agents, as such, appear. They\ntake exception to this orthodoxy, or at least to its unquestioned\nstatus. They maintain that from the empirically justified premise that\nsubpersonal states play a significant role in much epistemically\nrelevant cognition, we should expect that they constitute a domain in\nwhich we might reasonably expect to locate the \u201cmissing\nsource\u201d of epistemic value, beyond the value attached to mere\ntrue belief.\n3. Virtue Epistemology and the Value Problem\n\nSo far this discussion has taken it as given that whatever problems\nreliabilism faces in this regard, there are epistemological theories\navailable\u2014some form of virtue epistemology, for\nexample\u2014that can deal with them. But not everyone in the\ncontemporary debate accepts this. Perhaps the best known sceptic in\nthis respect is Jonathan Kvanvig (2003), who in effect argues that\nwhile virtue epistemology (along with a form of epistemic internalism)\ncan resolve the primary value problem (i.e., the problem of explaining\nwhy knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief), the real\nchallenge that we need to respond to is that set by the secondary\nvalue problem (i.e., the problem of explaining why knowledge is more\nvaluable than that which falls short of knowledge); and Kvanvig says\nthat there is no solution available to that. That is, Kvanvig\nargues that there is an epistemic standing\u2014in essence, justified\ntrue belief\u2014which falls short of knowledge but which is no less\nvaluable than knowledge. He concludes that the focus of epistemology\nshould not be on knowledge at all, but rather on\nunderstanding, an epistemic standing that Kvanvig maintains\nis clearly of more value than knowledge and those epistemic\nstandings that fall short of knowledge, such as justified true\nbelief.\n\nWhat Kvanvig says about understanding will be considered below. First\nthough, let us consider the specific challenge that he poses for\nvirtue epistemology. In essence, Kvanvig\u2019s argument rests on the\nassumption that it is essential to any virtue-theoretic account of\nknowledge\u2014and any internalist account of knowledge as well, for\nthat matter (i.e., an account that makes a subjective justification\ncondition necessary for knowledge possession)\u2014that it also\nincludes an anti-Gettier condition. If this is right, then it follows\nthat even if virtue epistemology has an answer to the primary value\nproblem\u2014and Kvanvig concedes that it does\u2014it will not\nthereby have an answer to the secondary value problem since knowledge\nis not simply virtuous true belief. Moreover, Kvanvig argues that once\nwe recognize what a gerrymandered notion a non-Gettierized account of\nknowledge is, it becomes apparent that there is nothing valuable about\nthe anti-Gettier condition on knowledge that needs to be imposed. But\nif that is right, then it follows by even virtue epistemic lights that\nknowledge\u2014i.e., non-Gettierized virtuous true believing\u2014is\nno more valuable than one of its proper sub-sets\u2014i.e., mere\nvirtuous true believing.\n\nThere are at least two aspects of Kvanvig\u2019s argument that are\npotentially problematic. To begin with, it isn\u2019t at all clear\nwhy the anti-Gettier condition on knowledge fails to add value,\nsomething that seems to be assumed here. More generally, Kvanvig seems\nto be implicitly supposing that if an analysis of knowledge is ugly\nand gerrymandered then that is itself reason to doubt that knowledge\nis particularly valuable, at least assuming that there are epistemic\nstandings that fall short of knowledge which can be given an elegant\nanalysis. While a similar assumption about the relationship between\nthe elegance (or otherwise) of the analysis of knowledge and the value\nof the analysandum is commonplace in the contemporary epistemological\nliterature\u2014see, for example, Zagzebski (1999) and Williamson\n(2000: chapter 1)\u2014this assumption is contentious. For critical\ndiscussion of this assumption, see DePaul (2009).\n\nIn any case, a more serious problem is that many virtue\nepistemologists\u2014among them Sosa (1988, 1991, 2007), Zagzebski\n(e.g., 1996, 1999) and Greco (2003, 2007, 2008, 2009)\u2014hereafter,\n\u2018robust virtue epistemologists\u2019\u2014think that their\nview can deal with Gettier problems without needing to add an\nadditional anti-Gettier condition on knowledge. The way this is\nachieved is by making the move noted above of treating knowledge as a\nstate that includes both the truly believing and the virtuous source\nby which that true belief was acquired. However, crucially, for robust\nvirtue epistemologists, there is an important difference between (i) a\nbelief\u2019s being true and virtuously formed, and (ii) a\nbelief\u2019s being true because virtuously formed.\nFormulating knowledge along the latter lines, they insist, ensures\nthat the target belief is not Gettiered. Even more, robust virtue\nepistemologists think the latter kind of formulation offers the\nresources to account for why knowledge is distinctively valuable.\n\nTo appreciate this point about value, consider the following\n\u2018performance normativity framework\u2019 which robust virtue\nepistemologists explicitly or implicitly embrace when accounting for\nthe value of knowledge as a true belief because of virtue.\n\n\nPerformance Normativity Framework\n\nDimensions of evaluation thesis Any performance with an aim\ncan be evaluated along three dimensions: (i) whether it is successful,\n(ii) whether it is skillful, and (iii) thirdly, whether the success is\nbecause of the skill.\n\nAchievement thesis If and only if the success is because of\nthe skill, the performance is not merely successful, but also, an\nachievement.\n\nValue thesis Achievements are finally valuable (i.e.,\nvaluable for their own sake) in a way that mere lucky successes are\nnot.\n\n\nNotice that, if knowledge is a cognitive performance that is an\nachievement, then with reference to the above set of claims,\nthe robust virtue epistemologist can respond to not only the secondary\nvalue problem but also the tertiary value problem (i.e., the problem\nof explaining why knowledge is more valuable, in kind and not merely\nin degree, than that which falls short of knowledge). This is because\nknowledge, on this view, is simply the cognitive aspect of a more\ngeneral notion, that of achievement, and this is the case even if mere\nsuccesses that are produced by intellectual virtues but which are not\nbecause of them, are not achievements.\u00a0(Though, see Kim\n2021 for a reversal of the idea that knowledge involves achievement;\naccording to Kim, all achievements, in any domain of endeavour, imply\nknowledge).\n\nAs regards the value thesis, one might object that some\nsuccesses that are because of ability\u2014i.e., achievements, on\nthis view\u2014are too trivial or easy or wicked to count as finally\nvaluable. This line of objection is far from decisive. After all, it\nis open to the proponent of robust virtue epistemology to argue that\nthe claim is only that all achievements qua achievements are\nfinally valuable, not that the overall value of every achievement is\nparticularly high. It is thus consistent with the proposal that some\nachievements have a very low\u2014perhaps even negative, if that is\npossible\u2014value in virtue of their other properties (e.g., their\ntriviality). Indeed, a second option in this regard is to allow that\nnot all achievements enjoy final value whilst nevertheless maintaining\nthat it is in the nature of achievements to have such value (e.g.,\nmuch in the way that one might argue that it is in the nature of\npleasure to be a good, even though some pleasures are bad). Since, as\nnoted above, all that is required to meet the (tertiary) value problem\nis to show that knowledge is generally distinctively valuable, this\nclaim would almost certainly suffice for the robust virtue\nepistemologist\u2019s purposes.\n\nIn any case, even if the value thesis is correct\u2014and indeed,\neven if the achievement and dimensions of evaluation theses are also\ncorrect\u2014the robust virtue epistemologist has not yet\nsatisfactorily vindicated any of the aforementioned value problems for\nknowledge unless knowledge is itself a kind of achievement\u2014and\nthat is the element of the proposal that is perhaps the most\ncontroversial. There are two key problems with the claim that\nknowledge involves cognitive achievement. The first is that there\nsometimes seems to be more to knowledge than a cognitive achievement;\nthe second is that there sometimes seems to be less to knowledge than\na cognitive achievement.\n\nAs regards the first claim, notice that achievements seem to be\ncompatible with at least one kind of luck. Suppose that an archer hits\na target by employing her relevant archery abilities, but that the\nsuccess is \u2018gettierized\u2019 by luck intervening between the\narcher\u2019s firing of the arrow and the hitting of the target. For\nexample, suppose that a freak gust of wind blows the arrow off-course,\nbut then a second freak gust of wind happens to blow it back on course\nagain. The archer\u2019s success is thus lucky in the sense that it\ncould very easily have been a failure. When it comes to\n\u2018intervening\u2019 luck of this sort, Greco\u2019s account of\nachievements is able to offer a good explanation of why the success in\nquestion does not constitute an achievement. After all, we would not\nsay that the success was because of the archer\u2019s ability in this\ncase.\n\nNotice, however, that not all forms of luck are of this intervening\nsort. Consider the following case offered by Pritchard (2010a: ch. 2).\nSuppose that nothing intervenes between the archer\u2019s firing of\nthe arrow and the hitting of the target. However, the success is still\nlucky in the relevant sense because, unbeknownst to the archer, she\njust happened to fire at the only target on the range that did not\ncontain a forcefield which would have repelled the arrow. Is the\narcher\u2019s success still an achievement? Intuition would seem to\ndictate that it is; it certainly seems to be a success that is because\nof ability, even despite the luckiness of that success. Achievements,\nthen, are, it seems, compatible with luck of this\n\u2018environmental\u2019 form even though they are not compatible\nwith luck of the standard \u2018intervening\u2019 form.\n\nThe significance of this conclusion for our purposes is that knowledge\nis incompatible with both forms of luck. In order to see\nthis, one only needs to note that an epistemological analogue of the\narcher case just given is the famous barn fa\u00e7ade example (e.g.,\nGinet 1975; Goldman 1976). In this example, we have an agent who forms\na true belief that there is a barn in front of him. Moreover, his\nbelief is not subject to the kind of \u2018intervening\u2019 luck\njust noted and which is a standard feature of Gettier-style cases. It\nis not as if, for example, he is looking at what appears to be a barn\nbut which is not in fact a barn, but that his belief is true\nnonetheless because there is a barn behind the barn shaped object that\nhe is looking at. Nevertheless, his belief is subject to environmental\nluck in that he is, unbeknownst to him, in barn fa\u00e7ade county\nin which every other barn-shaped object is a barn fa\u00e7ade. Thus,\nhis belief is only luckily true in that he could very easily have been\nmistaken in this respect. Given that this example is structurally\nequivalent to the \u2018archer\u2019 case just given, it seems that\njust as we treat the archer as exhibiting an achievement in that case,\nso we should treat this agent as exhibiting a cognitive achievement\nhere. The problem, however, is that until quite recently many\nphilosophers accepted that the agent in the barn fa\u00e7ade case\nlacks knowledge. Knowledge, it seems, is incompatible with\nenvironmental luck in a way that achievements, and thus cognitive\nachievements, are not (see, for example, Pritchard, e.g., 2012).\n\nRobust virtue epistemologists have made a number of salient points\nregarding this case. For example, Greco (2010, 2012) has argued for a\nconception of what counts as a cognitive ability according to which\nthe agent in the barn fa\u00e7ade case would not count as exhibiting\nthe relevant cognitive ability (see Pritchard 2010a: ch. 2 for a\ncritical discussion of this claim). Others, such as Sosa (e.g., 2007,\n2015) have responded by questioning whether the agent in the barn\nfa\u00e7ade case lacks knowledge, albeit, in a qualified sense.\nWhile Sosa\u2019s distinctive virtue epistemology allows for the\ncompatibility of barn fa\u00e7ade cases with animal\nknowledge (roughly: true belief because of ability), Sosa\nmaintains that the subject in barn fa\u00e7ade cases lacks\nreflective knowledge (roughly: a true belief whose\ncreditability to ability or virtue is itself creditable to a\nsecond-order ability or virtue of the agent). Other philosophers\n(e.g., Hetherington (1998) have challenged the view that barn\nfa\u00e7ade protagonists in fact lack (any kind of) knowledge. In a\nseries of empirical studies, most people attributed knowledge in barn\nfa\u00e7ade cases and related cases (Colaco, Buckwalter, Stich &\nMachery 2014; Turri, Buckwalter & Blouw 2015; Turri 2016a). In one\nstudy, over 80% of participants attributed knowledge (Turri 2016b). In\nanother study, most professional philosophers attributed knowledge\n(Horvath & Wiegmann 2016). At least one theory of knowledge has\nbeen defended on the grounds that it explains why knowledge is\nintuitively present in such cases (Turri 2016c).\n\nEven setting that issue aside, however, there is a second problem on\nthe horizon, which is that it seems that there are some cases of\nknowledge which are not cases of cognitive achievement. One such case\nis offered by Jennifer Lackey (2007), albeit to illustrate a slightly\ndifferent point. Lackey asks us to imagine someone arriving at the\ntrain station in Chicago who, wishing to obtain directions to the\nSears Tower, approaches the first adult passer-by she sees. Suppose\nthe person she asks is indeed knowledgeable about the area and gives\nher the directions that she requires. Intuitively, any true belief\nthat the agent forms on this basis would ordinarily be counted as\nknowledge. Indeed, if one could not gain testimonial knowledge in this\nway, then it seems that we know an awful lot less than we think we\nknow. However, it has been argued, in such a case the agent does not\nhave a true belief because of her cognitive abilities but, rather,\nbecause of her informant\u2019s cognitive abilities. If this\nis correct, then there are cases of knowledge which are not also cases\nof cognitive achievement.\n\nIt is worth being clear about the nature of this objection. Lackey\ntakes cases like this to demonstrate that one can possess knowledge\nwithout it being primarily creditable to one that one\u2019s belief\nis true. Note though that this is compatible, as Lackey notes, with\ngranting that the agent is employing her cognitive abilities\nto some degree, and so surely deserves some credit for the\ntruth of the belief formed (she would not have asked just anyone, for\nexample, nor would she have simply accepted just any answer given by\nher informant). The point is thus rather that whatever credit the\nagent is due for having a true belief, it is not the kind of credit\nthat reflects a bona fide cognitive achievement because of\nhow this cognitive success involves \u2018piggy-backing\u2019 on the\ncognitive efforts of others.\n4. Understanding and Epistemic Value\n\nAs noted above, the main conclusion that Kvanvig (2003) draws from his\nreflections on the value problem is that the real focus in\nepistemology should not be on knowledge at all but on understanding,\nan epistemic standing that Kvanvig does think is especially valuable\nbut which, he argues, is distinct from knowing\u2014i.e., one can\nhave knowledge without the corresponding understanding, and one can\nhave understanding without the corresponding knowledge. (Pritchard\n[e.g., 2010a: chs 1\u20134] agrees, though his reasons for taking\nthis line are somewhat different to Kvanvig\u2019s). It is perhaps\nthis aspect of Kvanvig\u2019s book that has prompted the most\ncritical response, so it is worth briefly dwelling on his claims here\nin a little more detail.\n\nTo begin with, one needs to get clear what Kvanvig has in mind when he\ntalks of understanding, since many commentators have found the\nconception of understanding that he targets problematic. The two\nusages of the term \u2018understanding\u2019 in ordinary language\nthat Kvanvig focuses on\u2014and which he regards as being especially\nimportant to epistemology\u2014are\n\n\nwhen understanding is claimed for some object, such as some subject\nmatter, and when it involves understanding that something is the case.\n(Kvanvig 2003: 189)\n\n\nThe first kind of understanding he calls \u201cobjectual\nunderstanding\u201d, the second kind \u201cpropositional\nunderstanding\u201d. In both cases, understanding requires that one\nsuccessfully grasp how one\u2019s beliefs in the relevant\npropositions cohere with other propositions one believes (e.g.,\nKvanvig 2003: 192, 197\u20138). This requirement entails that\nunderstanding is directly factive in the case of propositional\nunderstanding and indirectly factive in the case of objectual\nunderstanding\u2014i.e., the agent needs to have at least mostly true\nbeliefs about the target subject matter in order to be truly said to\nhave objectual understanding of that subject matter.\n\nGiven that understanding\u2014propositional understanding at any\nrate\u2014is factive, Kvanvig\u2019s argument for why understanding\nis distinct from knowledge does not relate to this condition (as we\nwill see in a moment, it is standard to argue that understanding is\ndistinct from knowledge precisely because only understanding is\nnon-factive). Instead, Kvanvig notes two key differences between\nunderstanding and knowledge: that understanding, unlike knowledge,\nadmits of degrees, and that understanding, unlike knowledge, is\ncompatible with epistemic luck. Most commentators, however, have\ntended to focus not on these two theses concerning the different\nproperties of knowledge and understanding, but rather on\nKvanvig\u2019s claim that understanding is (at least indirectly)\nfactive.\n\nFor example, Elgin (2009; cf. Elgin 1996, 2004; Janvid 2014) and Riggs\n(2009) argue that it is possible for an agent to have understanding\nand yet lack true beliefs in the relevant propositions. For example,\nElgin (2009) argues that it is essential to treat scientific\nunderstanding as non-factive. She cites a number of cases in which\nscience has progressed from one theory to a better theory where, we\nwould say, understanding has increased in the process even though the\ntheories are, strictly speaking at least, false. A different\nkind of case that Elgin offers concerns scientific idealizations, such\nas the ideal gas law. Scientists know full well that no actual gas\nbehaves in this way, yet the introduction of this useful fiction\nclearly improved our understanding of the behavior of actual gasses.\nFor a defense of Kvanvig\u2019s view in the light of these charges,\nsee Kvanvig (2009a, 2009b; Carter & Gordon 2014).\n\nA very different sort of challenge to Kvanvig\u2019s treatment of\nunderstanding comes from Brogaard (2005, Other Internet Resources).\nShe argues that Kvanvig\u2019s claim that understanding is of greater\nvalue than knowledge is only achieved because he fails to give a rich\nenough account of knowledge. More specifically, Brogaard claims that\nwe can distinguish between objectual and propositional knowledge just\nas we can distinguish between objectual and propositional\nunderstanding. Propositional understanding, argues Brogaard, no more\nrequires coherence in one\u2019s beliefs than propositional\nknowledge, and so the difference in value between the two cannot lie\nhere. Moreover, while Brogaard grants that objectual understanding\ndoes incorporate a coherence requirement, this again fails to mark a\nvalue-relevant distinction between knowledge and understanding because\nthe relevant counterpart\u2014objectual knowledge (i.e., knowledge of\na subject matter)\u2014also incorporates a coherence requirement. So\nprovided that we are consistent in our comparisons of objectual and\npropositional understanding on the one hand, and objectual and\npropositional knowledge on the other, Kvanvig fails to make a sound\ncase for thinking that understanding is of greater value than\nknowledge.\n\nFinally, a further challenge to Kvanvig\u2019s treatment of knowledge\nand understanding focuses on his claims regarding epistemic luck, and\nin particular, his insistence that luck cases show how understanding\nand propositional knowledge come apart from one another. In order to\nbring the luck-based challenge into focus, we can distinguish three\nkinds of views about the relationship between understanding and\nepistemic luck that are found in the literature: strong\ncompatibilism (e.g., Kvanvig 2003; Rohwer 2014), moderate\ncompatibilism (e.g., Pritchard 2010a:\u00a0ch. 4) and\nincompatibilism (e.g., Grimm 2006; Sliwa 2015). Strong\ncompatibilism is the view that understanding is compatible with the\nvarieties of epistemic luck that are generally taken to undermine\npropositional knowledge. In particular, incompatibilists maintain that\nunderstanding is undermined by neither (i) the kind of luck that\nfeatures in traditional Gettier-style cases (1963) cases, nor with\n(ii) purely \u2018environmental luck (e.g., Pritchard 2005) of the\nsort that features in \u2018fake barn\u2019 cases (e.g., Goldman\n1979) where the fact that one\u2019s belief could easily be incorrect\nis a matter of being in an inhospitable epistemic environment.\nModerate compatibilism, by contrast, maintains that while\nunderstanding is like propositional knowledge in that it is\nincompatible with the kind of luck that features in traditional\nGettier cases, it is nonetheless compatible with environmental\nepistemic luck. Incompatibilism rejects that either kind of epistemic\nluck case demonstrates that understanding and propositional knowledge\ncome apart, and so maintains that understanding is incompatible with\nepistemic luck to the same extent that propositional knowledge is.\n5. The Value of Knowledge-How\n\nThe received view in mainstream epistemology, at least since Gilbert\nRyle (e.g., 1949), has been to regard knowledge-that and knowledge-how\nas different epistemic standings, such that knowing how to do\nsomething is not simply a matter of knowing propositions, viz., of\nknowledge-that. If this view\u2014known as\nanti-intellectualism\u2014is correct, then the value of\nknowledge-how needn\u2019t be accounted for in terms of the value of\nknowing propositions. Furthermore, if anti-intellectualism is assumed,\nthen\u2014to the extent that there is any analogous \u2018value\nproblem\u2019 for knowledge-how\u2014such a problem needn\u2019t\nmaterialize as the philosophical problem of determining what it is\nabout knowledge-how that makes it more valuable than mere true\nbelief.\n\nJason Stanley & Timothy Williamson (2001) have, however,\ninfluentially resisted the received anti-intellectualist thinking\nabout knowledge-how. On Stanley & Williamson\u2019s\nview\u2014intellectualism\u2014knowledge-how is a kind of\npropositional knowledge, i.e., knowledge-that, such that\n(roughly) S knows how to \u03c6 iff there is a way w\nsuch that S knows that w is a way for S to\n\u03c6. Accordingly, if Hannah knows how to ride a bike, then this is\nin virtue of her propositional knowledge\u2014viz., her knowing of\nsome way w that w is the way for her (Hannah) to\nride a bike.\n\nBy reducing in this manner knowledge\u2014how to a kind of\nknowledge\u2014that, intellectualists such as Stanley have accepted\nthat knowledge-how should have properties characteristic of\npropositional knowledge, (see, for example, Stanley 2011: 215), of\nwhich knowledge-how is a kind. Furthermore, the value of knowledge-how\nshould be able to be accounted for, on intellectualism, with reference\nto the value of the propositional knowledge that the intellectualist\nidentifies with knowledge-how.\n\nIn recent work, Carter and Pritchard (2015) have challenged\nintellectualism on this point. One such example they offer to this end\ninvolves testimony and skilled action. For example, suppose that a\nskilled guitarist tells an amateur how to play a very tricky guitar\nriff. Carter and Pritchard (2015: 801) argue that though the amateur\ncan uncontroversially acquire testimonial knowledge from the expert\nthat, for some way w that w is the way to play the\nriff, it might be that the expert, but not novice, knows how\nto play the riff. Further, they suggest that whilst the amateur is\nbetter off, with respect to the aim of playing the riff, than he was\nprior to gaining the testimonial knowledge he did, he would likewise\nbe better off further\u2014viz., he would have something even\nmore valuable\u2014if he, like the expert, had the lick down\ncold (something the amateur does not have simply on the basis of his\nacquired testimonial knowledge) (Ibid: 801).\n\nThe conclusion Carter and Pritchard draw from this and other similar\ncases (e.g., 2015: \u00a73; see also Poston 2016) is that the value of\nknowledge-how cannot be accounted for with reference to the value of\nthe items of knowledge-that which the intellectualist identifies with\nknowledge-how If this is right, then if there is a \u2018value\nproblem\u2019 for knowledge-how, we shouldn\u2019t expect it to be\nthe problem of determining what is it about certain items of\npropositional knowledge that makes these more valuable than\ncorresponding mere true beliefs. A potential area for future research\nis to consider what an analogue value problem for knowledge-how might\nlook like, on an anti-intellectualist framework.\n\nAccording to Carter and Pritchard\u2019s diagnosis, the underlying\nexplanation for this difference in value is that knowledge-how (like\nunderstanding, as discussed in\n \u00a74)\n essentially involves a kind of cognitive achievement, unlike\npropositional knowledge, for reasons discussed in \u00a74. If this\ndiagnosis is correct, then further pressure is arguably placed on the\nrobust virtue epistemologist\u2019s \u2018achievement\u2019\nsolution to the value problems for knowledge-that, as surveyed in\n \u00a73.\n Recall that, according to robust virtue epistemology, the distinctive\nvalue of knowledge-that is accounted for in terms of the value of\ncognitive achievement (i.e., success because of ability) which robust\nvirtue epistemologists take to be essential to propositional\nknowledge. But, if the presence of cognitive achievement is what\naccounts for why knowledge-how has a value that is not present in the\nitems of knowledge-that the intellectualist identifies with\nknowledge-how, this result would seem to stand in tension with the\nrobust virtue epistemologist\u2019s insistence that what affords\npropositional knowledge a value lacked by mere true belief is that the\nformer essentially involves cognitive achievement.\n6. Other Accounts of the Value of Knowledge\n\nJohn Hawthorne (2004; cf. Stanley 2005; Fantl & McGrath 2002) has\nargued that knowledge is valuable because of the role it plays in\npractical reasoning. More specifically, Hawthorne (2004: 30) argues\nfor the principle that one should use a proposition p as a\npremise in one\u2019s practical reasoning only if one knows\np. Hawthorne primarily motivates this line of argument by\nappeal to the lottery case. This concerns an agent\u2019s true belief\nthat she holds the losing ticket for a fair lottery with long odds and\na large cash prize, a belief that is based solely on the fact that she\nhas reflected on the odds involved. Intuitively, we would say that\nsuch an agent lacks knowledge of what she believes, even though her\nbelief is true and even though her justification for what she\nbelieves\u2014assessed in terms of the likelihood, given this\njustification, of her being right\u2014is unusually strong. Moreover,\nwere this agent to use this belief as a premise in her practical\nreasoning, and so infer that she should throw the ticket away without\nchecking the lottery results in the paper for example, then we would\nregard her reasoning as problematic.\n\nLottery cases therefore seem to show that justified true belief, no\nmatter how strong the degree of justification, is not enough for\nacceptable practical reasoning\u2014instead, knowledge is required.\nMoreover, notice that we can alter the example slightly so that the\nagent does possess knowledge while at the same time having a\nweaker justification for what she believes (where strength of\njustification is again assessed in terms of the likelihood, given this\njustification, that the agent\u2019s belief is true). If the agent\nhad formed her true belief by reading the results in a reliable\nnewspaper, for example, then she would count as knowing the target\nproposition and can then infer that she should throw the ticket away\nwithout criticism. It is more likely, however, that the newspaper has\nprinted the result wrongly than that she should win the lottery. This\nsort of consideration seems to show that knowledge, even when\naccompanied by a relatively weak justification, is better (at least\nwhen it comes to practical reasoning) than a true belief that is\nsupported by a relatively strong justification but does not amount to\nknowledge. If this is the right way to think about the connection\nbetween knowledge possession and practical reasoning, then it seems to\noffer a potential response to at least the secondary value\nproblem.\n\nA second author who thinks that our understanding of the concept of\nknowledge can have important ramifications for the value of knowledge\nis Edward Craig (1990). Craig\u2019s project begins with a thesis\nabout the value of the concept of knowledge. Simplifying somewhat,\nCraig hypothesises that the concept of knowledge is important to us\nbecause it fulfills the valuable function of enabling us to identify\nreliable informants. The idea is that it is clearly of immense\npractical importance to be able to recognize those from whom we can\ngain true beliefs, and that it was in response to this need that the\nconcept of knowledge arose. As with Hawthorne\u2019s theory, this\nproposal, if correct, could potentially offer a resolution of at least\nthe secondary value problem.\n\nRecently, there have been additional attempts to follow\u2014broadly\nspeaking\u2014Craig\u2019s project, for which the value of knowledge\nis understood in terms of the functional role that\n\u2018knowledge\u2019 plays in fulfilling our practical needs. The\nmatter of how to identify this functional role has received increasing\nrecent attention. For example, David Henderson (2009), Robin McKenna\n(2013), Duncan Pritchard (2012) and Michael Hannon (2015) have\ndefended views about the concept of knowledge (or knowledge\nascriptions) that are broadly inspired by Craig\u2019s favored\naccount of the function of knowledge as identifying reliable\ninformants. A notable rival account, defended by Klemens Kappel\n(2010), Christoph Kelp (2011, 2014) and Patrick Rysiew (2012; cf.\nKvanvig 2012) identifies closure of inquiry as the relevant\nfunction. For Krista Lawlor (2013) the relevant function is identified\n(\u00e0 la Austin) as that of providing assurance,\nand for James Beebe (2012), it\u2019s expressing epistemic\napproval/disapproval.\n\nIn one sense, such accounts are in competition with one another, in\nthat they offer different practical explications of\n\u2018knowledge\u2019. However, these accounts all accept\n(explicitly or tacitly) a more general insight, which is that\nconsiderations about the function that the concept of knowledge plays\nin fulfilling practical needs should inform our theories of the nature\nand corresponding value of knowledge. This more general point remains\ncontroversial in contemporary metaepistemology. For some arguments\nagainst supposing that a practical explication of\n\u2018knowledge\u2019, in terms of some need-fulfilling function,\nshould inform our accounts of the nature or knowledge, see for example\nGerken (2015). For a more extreme form of argument in favor of\ndivorcing considerations to do with how and why we use\n\u2018knows\u2019 from epistemological theorizing altogether, see\nHazlett (2010; cf. Turri 2011b).\n\nA further and more recent practically oriented approach to the value\nof knowledge is defended by Grindrod (2019), who considers\nspecifically the ramifications of epistemic\ncontextualism\u00a0for the value of knowledge. Contextualists\nmaintain that knowledge attributing sentences can vary in truth value\nacross different contexts of utterance. This kind of position about\nthe semantics of knowledge attributions is often motivated by\n\u00a0context-shifting cases, such as DeRose\u2019s (1992) bank case,\nwhich seem to suggest that the a knowledge attribution is true\ndepends on the epistemic standards (as fixed by practical stakes)\nof the attributor of the knowledge ascription (see entry on\n Epistemic Contextualism).\n Grindrod maintains that if epistemic contextualism is true, then\nepistemic value(including whatever epistemic value might\nseparate knowledge from mere true belief) should be\ncontextualised.\n7. Weak and Strong Conceptions of Knowledge\n\nLaurence BonJour argues that reflecting on the value of knowledge\nleads us to reject a prevailing trend in epistemology over the past\nseveral decades, namely, fallibilism, or what BonJour calls the\n\u201cweak conception\u201d of knowledge.\n\nBonJour outlines four traditional assumptions about knowledge,\nunderstood as roughly justified true belief, which he\n\u201cbroadly\u201d endorses (BonJour 2010: 58\u20139). First,\nknowledge is a \u201cvaluable and desirable cognitive state\u201d\nindicative of \u201cfull cognitive success\u201d. Any acceptable\ntheory of knowledge must \u201cmake sense of\u201d knowledge\u2019s\nimportant value. Second, knowledge is \u201can all or nothing matter,\nnot a matter of degree\u201d. There is no such thing as degrees of\nknowing: either you know or you don\u2019t. Third, epistemic\njustification comes in degrees, from weak to strong. Fourth, epistemic\njustification is essentially tied to \u201clikelihood or probability\nof truth\u201d, such that the strength of justification covaries with\nhow likely it makes the truth of the belief in question.\n\nOn this traditional approach, we are invited to think of justification\nas measured by how probable the belief is given the reasons\nor evidence you have. One convenient way to measure probability is to\nuse the decimals in the interval [0, 1]. A probability of 0 means that\nthe claim is guaranteed to be false. A probability of 1 means that the\nclaim is guaranteed to be true. A probability of .5 means that the\nclaim is just as likely to be true as it is to be false. The question\nthen becomes, how probable must your belief be for it to be\nknowledge?\n\nObviously it must be greater than .5. But how much greater? Suppose we\nsay that knowledge requires a probability of 1\u2014that is,\nknowledge requires our justification or reasons to guarantee\nthe truth of the belief. Call such reasons conclusive\nreasons.\n\nThe strong conception of knowledge says knowledge requires\nconclusive reasons. We can motivate the strong conception as follows.\nIf the aim of belief is truth, then it makes sense that knowledge\nwould require conclusive reasons, because conclusive reasons guarantee\nthat belief\u2019s aim is achieved. The three components of the\ntraditional view of knowledge thus fit together\n\u201ccohesively\u201d to explain why knowledge is valued as a state\nof full cognitive success.\n\nBut all is not well with the strong conception, or so philosophers\nhave claimed over the past several decades. The strong conception\nseems to entail that we know nearly nothing at all about the material\nworld outside of our own minds or about the past. For we could have\nhad all the reasons we do in fact have, even if the world around us or\nthe past had been different. (Think of Descartes\u2019s evil genius.)\nThis conflicts with commonsense and counts against the strong\nconception. But what is the alternative?\n\nThe alternative is that knowledge requires reasons that make the\nbelief very likely true, but needn\u2019t guarantee it. This is the\nweak conception of knowledge. Most epistemologists accept the\nweak conception of knowledge. But BonJour asks a challenging question:\nwhat is the \u201cmagic\u201d level of probability required by\nknowledge? BonJour then argues that a satisfactory answer to this\nquestion isn\u2019t forthcoming. For any point short of 1 would seem\narbitrary. Why should we pick that point exactly? The same\ncould be said for a vague range that includes points short of\n1\u2014why, exactly, should the vague range extend roughly that\nfar but not further? This leads to an even deeper problem for the\nweak conception. It brings into doubt the value of knowledge. Can\nknowledge really be valuable if it is arbitrarily defined?\n\nA closely related problem for the weak conception presents itself.\nSuppose for the sake of argument that we settle on .9 as the required\nlevel of probability. Suppose further that you believe Q and\nyou believe R, that Q and R are both true,\nand that you have reached the .9 threshold for each. Thus the weak\nconception entails that you know Q, and you know R.\nIntuitively, if you know Q and you also know R, then\nyou\u2019re automatically in a position to know the conjunction\nQ & R. But the weak conception cannot sustain\nthis judgment. For the probability of the conjunction of two\nindependent claims, such as Q and R, equals the\nproduct of their probabilities. (This is the special conjunction rule\nfrom probability theory.) In this case, the probability of Q\n= .9 and the probability of R = .9. So the probability of the\nconjunction (Q & R) = .9 \u00d7 .9 = .81, which\nfalls short of the required .9. So the weak conception of knowledge\nalong with a law of probability entail that you\u2019re automatically\nnot in a position to know the conjunction (Q &\nR). BonJour considers this to be \u201can intuitively\nunacceptable result\u201d, because after all,\n\n\nwhat is the supposed state of knowledge really worth, if even the\nsimplest inference from two pieces of knowledge [might] not lead to\nfurther knowledge? (BonJour 2010: 63)\n\n\nBonJour concludes that the weak conception fails to explain the value\nof knowledge, and thus that the strong conception must be true. He\nrecognizes that this implies that we don\u2019t know most of the\nthings we ordinarily say and think that we know. He explains this\naway, however, partly on grounds that knowledge is the norm of\npractical reasoning, which creates strong \u201cpractical\npressure\u201d to confabulate or exaggerate in claiming to know\nthings, so that we can view ourselves as reasoning and acting\nappropriately, even though usually the best we can do is to\napproximate appropriate action and reasoning. (BonJour 2010:\n75).\n8. The Value of True Belief\n\nSo far, in common with most of the contemporary literature in this\nregard, we have tended to focus on the value of knowledge relative to\nother epistemic standings. A related debate in this respect,\nhowever\u2014one that has often taken place largely in tandem with\nthe mainstream debate on the value of knowledge\u2014has specifically\nconcerned itself with the value of true belief and we will turn now to\nthis issue.\n\nFew commentators treat truth or belief as being by themselves valuable\n(though see Kvanvig 2003: ch. 1), but it is common to treat true\nbelief as valuable, at least instrumentally. True beliefs are clearly\noften of great practical use to us. The crucial caveat here,\nof course, concerns the use of the word \u2018often\u2019. After\nall, it is also often the case that a true belief might actually\nmilitate against one achieving one\u2019s goals, as when one is\nunable to summon the courage to jump a ravine and thereby get to\nsafety, because one knows that there is a serious\npossibility that one might fail to reach the other side. In such cases\nit seems that a false belief in one\u2019s abilities\u2014e.g., the\nfalse belief that one could easily jump the ravine\u2014would be\nbetter than a true belief, if the goal in question (jumping the\nravine) is to be achieved.\n\nMoreover, some true beliefs are beliefs in trivial matters, and in\nthese cases it isn\u2019t at all clear why we should value such\nbeliefs at all. Imagine someone who, for no good reason, concerns\nherself with measuring each grain of sand on a beach, or someone who,\neven while being unable to operate a telephone, concerns herself with\nremembering every entry in a foreign phone book. Such a person would\nthereby gain lots of true beliefs but, crucially, one would regard\nsuch truth-gaining activity as rather pointless. After all, these true\nbeliefs do not seem to serve any valuable purpose, and so do not\nappear to have any instrumental value (or, at the very least, what\ninstrumental value these beliefs have is vanishingly small). It would,\nperhaps, be better\u2014and thus of greater value\u2014to have fewer\ntrue beliefs, and possibly more false ones, if this meant that the\ntrue beliefs that one had concerned matters of real consequence.\n\nAt most, then, we can say that true beliefs often have instrumental\nvalue. What about final (or intrinsic) value? One might think that if\nthe general instrumental value of true belief was moot then so too\nwould be the intuitively stronger thesis that true belief is generally\nfinally valuable. Nevertheless, many have argued for such a claim.\n\nOne condition that seems to speak in favor of this thesis is that as\ntruth seekers we are naturally curious about what the truth is, even\nwhen that truth is of no obvious practical import. Accordingly, it\ncould be argued that from a purely epistemic point of view, we do\nregard all true belief as valuable for its own sake, regardless of\nwhat further prudential goals we might have (e.g., Goldman 1999: 3;\nLynch 2004: 15\u201316; Alston 2005: 31; Pritchard 2019; cf. Baehr\n2012: 5). Curiosity will only take you so far in this regard, however,\nsince we are only curious about certain truths, not all of them. To\nreturn to the examples given a moment ago, no fully rational agent is\ncurious about the measurements of every grain of sand on a given\nbeach, or the name of every person in a random phone book\u2014i.e.,\nno rational person wants to know these truths independently of having\nsome prudential reason for knowing them.\n\nStill, one could argue for a weaker claim and merely say that it is\nprima facie or pro tanto finally good to believe the\ntruth (cf. David 2005; Lynch 2009), where cases of trivial truths such\nas those just given are simply cases where, all things\nconsidered, it is not good to believe the truth. After all, we\nare familiar with the fact that something can be prima facie\nor pro tanto finally good without being all-things-considered\ngood. For example, it may be finally good to help the poor and needy,\nbut not all-things-considered good given that helping the poor and\nneedy would prevent you from doing something else which is at present\nmore important (such as saving that child from drowning).\n\nAt this point one might wonder why it matters so much to (some)\nepistemologists that true belief is finally valuable. Why not instead\njust treat true belief as often of instrumental value and leave the\nmatter at that? The answer to this question lies in the fact that many\nwant to regard truth\u2014and thereby true belief\u2014as being the\nfundamental epistemic goal, in the sense that ultimately it is only\ntruth that is epistemically valuable (so, for example, while\njustification is epistemically valuable, it is only epistemically\nvaluable because of how it is a guide to truth). Accordingly, if true\nbelief is not finally valuable\u2014and only typically instrumentally\nvaluable\u2014then this seems to downplay the status of the\nepistemological project.\n\nThere are a range of options here. The conservative option is to\ncontend that truth is the fundamental goal of epistemology and also\ncontend that true belief is finally valuable\u2014at least in some\nrestricted fashion. Marian David (2001, 2005) falls into this\ncategory. In contrast, one might argue that truth is the fundamental\ngoal while at the same time claiming that true belief is not\nfinally valuable. Sosa (see especially 2004, but also 2000a, 2003)\nseems (almost) to fall into this camp, since he claims that while\ntruth is the fundamental epistemic value, we can accommodate this\nthought without having to thereby concede that true belief is finally\nvaluable, a point that has been made in a similar fashion by Alan\nMillar (2011: \u00a73). Sosa often compares the epistemic domain to\nother domains of evaluation where the fundamental good of that domain\nis not finally valuable. So, for example, the fundamental goal of the\n\u2018coffee-production\u2019 domain may be great tasting coffee,\nbut no-one is going to argue that great tasting coffee is finally\nvaluable. Perhaps the epistemic domain is in this respect like the\ncoffee-production domain?\n\nAnother line of response against the thesis that true belief is\nfinally valuable is to suggest that this thesis leads to a\nreductio. Michael DePaul (2001) has notably advanced such an\nargument. According to DePaul, the thesis that true belief is finally\nvaluable implies that all true beliefs are equally epistemically\nvaluable. Though this latter claim, DePaul argues, is false, as is\nillustrated by cases where two sets each containing an equal number of\ntrue beliefs intuitively differ in epistemic value. Ahlstrom-Vij and\nGrimm (2013) have criticized DePaul\u2019s claim that the thesis that\ntrue belief is finally valuable implies that two sets each containing\nan equal number of true beliefs must not differ in epistemic value.\nAdditionally, Nick Treanor (2014) has criticized the argument for a\ndifferent reason, which is that (contra DePaul) there is no\nclear example of two sets which contain the same number of true\nbeliefs. More recently, Xingming Hu (2017) has defended the final\nvalue of true belief against DePaul\u2019s argument, though Hu argues\nfurther that neither Ahlstrom-Vij and Grimm\u2019s (2013) nor\nTreanor\u2019s (2014) critique of DePaul\u2019s argument is\ncompelling.\n\nAnother axis on which the debate about the value of true belief can be\nconfigured is in terms of whether one opts for an epistemic-value\nmonism or an epistemic-value pluralism\u2014that is, whether one\nthinks there is only one fundamental epistemic goal, or several.\nKvanvig (e.g., 2005) endorses epistemic-value pluralism, since he\nthinks that there are a number of fundamental epistemic goals, with\neach of them being of final value. Crucial to Kvanvig\u2019s argument\nis that there are some epistemic goals which are not obviously\ntruth-related\u2014he cites the examples of having an empirically\nadequate theory, making sense of the course of one\u2019s experience,\nand inquiring responsibly, and more recently, Brent Madison (2017) has\nargued by appealing to a new evil demon thought experiment, that\nepistemic justification itself should be included in such a list. This\nis important because if the range of goals identified were all\ntruth-related, then it would prompt the natural response that such\ngoals are valuable only because of their connection to the truth, and\nhence not fundamental epistemic goals at all.\n\nPresumably, though, it ought also to be possible to make a case for an\nepistemic-value pluralism where the fundamental epistemic goals were\nnot finally valuable (or, at least, \u00e0 la Sosa, where\none avoided taking a stance on this issue). More precisely, if an\nepistemic-value monism that does not regard the fundamental epistemic\ngoal as finally valuable can be made palatable, then there seems no\nclear reason why a parallel view that opted for pluralism in this\nregard could not similarly be given a plausible supporting story.\n9. The Value of Extended Knowledge\n\nIn his essay, \u201cMeno in a Digital World\u201d, Pascal\nEngel (2016) questions whether the original value problem applies to\nthe kind of knowledge or pseudo-knowledge that we get from the\ninternet? (2016: 1). One might initially think that internet and/or\ndigitally acquired knowledge raises no new issues for the value\nproblem. On this line of thought, if digitally acquired (e.g., Googled\nknowledge, information stored in iPhone apps, etc.) is\ngenuine knowledge, then whatever goes for knowledge more\ngenerally, vis-\u00e0-vis the value problems surveyed in\n\u00a7\u00a71\u20132, thereby goes for knowledge acquired from our\ngadgets.\n\nHowever, recent work at the intersection of epistemology and the\nphilosophy of mind suggests there are potentially some new and\nepistemologically interesting philosophical problems associated with\nthe value of technology-assisted knowledge. These problems correspond\nwith two ways of conceiving of knowledge as extending beyond\ntraditional, intracranial boundaries (e.g., Pritchard\u00a02018). In\nparticular, the kinds of \u2018extended knowledge\u2019 which have\npotential import for the value of knowledge debate correspond with the\nextended mind thesis (for discussion on how this thesis\ninterfaces with the hypothesis of extended cognition, see Carter,\nKallestrup, Pritchard, & Palermos 2014) and cases involving what\nMichael Lynch (2016) calls \u2018neuromedia\u2019 intelligence\naugmentation.\n\nAccording to the extended mind thesis (EMT), mental states\n(e.g., beliefs) can supervene in part on extra-organismic elements of\nthe world, such as laptops, phones and notebooks, that are typically\nregarded as \u2018external\u2019 to our minds. This thesis, defended\nmost notably by Andy Clark and David Chalmers (1998), should not be\nconflated with comparatively weaker and less controversial thesis of\ncontent externalism (e.g., Putnam 1975; Burge 1986),\naccording to which the meaning or content of mental states can be\nfixed by extra-organismic features of our physical or\nsocial-linguistic environments.\n\nWhat the proponent of EMT submits is that mental states\nthemselves can partly supervene on extracranial artifacts\n(e.g., notebooks, iPhones) provided these extracranial artifacts play\nkinds of functional roles normally played by on-board, biological\ncognitive processes. For example, to borrow an (adapted) case from\nClark and Chalmers (1998), suppose an Alzheimer\u2019s patient,\n\u2018Otto\u2019, begins to outsource the task of memory storage and\nretrieval to his iPhone, having appreciated that his biological memory\nis failing. Accordingly, when Otto acquires new information, he\nautomatically records it in his phone\u2019s \u2018memory\napp\u2019, and when he needs old information, he (also, automatically\nand seamlessly) opens his memory app and looks it up. The iPhone comes\nto play for Otto the functionally isomorphic role that biological\nmemory used to play for him vis-\u00e0-vis the process of\nmemory storage and retrieval. Just as we attribute to normally\nfunctioning agents knowledge in virtue of their (non-occurrent)\ndispositional beliefs stored in biological memory (for example, five\nminutes ago, you knew that Paris is the capital of France), so, with\nEMT in play, we should be prepared to attribute knowledge to Otto in\nvirtue of the \u2018extended\u2019 (dispositional) beliefs which are\nstored in his notebook, provided Otto is as epistemically diligent in\nencoding and retrieving information as he was before (e.g., Pritchard\n2010b).\n\nThe import EMT has for the value of knowledge debate now takes shape:\nwhatever epistemically valuable properties (if any) are distinctively\npossessed by knowledge, they must be properties that obtain in\nOtto\u2019s case so as to add value to what would otherwise be\nmere true (dispositional) beliefs that are stored,\nextracranially, in Otto\u2019s iPhone. But it is initially puzzling\njust why, and how, this should be. After all, even if we accept the\nintuition that the epistemic value of traditional (intracranial)\nknowledge exceeds the value of corresponding true opinion, it is, as\nEngel (2016), Lynch (2016) and Carter (2017) have noted, at best not\nclear that this comparative intuition holds in the extended case,\nwhere knowledge is possessed simply by virtue of information\npersisting in digital storage.\n\nFor example, consider again Plato\u2019s solution to the value\nproblem canvassed in\n \u00a71:\n knowledge, unlike true belief, must be \u2018tied-down\u2019 to the\ntruth. Mere true belief is more likely to be lost, which makes it less\nvaluable than knowledge. One potential worry is that extended\nknowledge, as per EMT\u2014literally, often times, knowledge stored\nin the cloud\u2014is by its very nature not \u2018tethered\u2019,\nor for that matter even tetherable, in a way that corresponding items\nof accurate information which fall short of knowledge are not. Nor\narguably does this sort of knowledge in the cloud clearly have the\nkind of \u2018stability\u2019 that Olsson (2009) claims is what\ndistinguishes knowledge from true opinion (cf., Walker 2019). Perhaps\neven less does it appear to constitute a valuable cognitive\n\u2018achievement\u2019, as per robust virtue epistemologists such\nas Greco and Sosa.\n\nEMT is of course highly controversial, (see, for example, Adams &\nAizawa 2008), and so one way to sidestep the implications for the\nvalue of knowledge debate posed by the possibility of knowledge that\nis extended via extended beliefs, is to simply resist EMT as\na thesis about the metaphysics of mind.\n\nHowever, there are other ways in which the technology-assisted\nknowledge could have import for the traditional value problems. In\nrecent work, Michael P. Lynch (2016) argues that, given the increase\nin cognitive offloading coupled with evermore subtle and physically\nsmaller intelligence-augmentation technologies (e.g., Bostrom &\nSandberg 2009), it is just a matter of time before the majority of the\ngadgetry we use for cognitive tasks will be by and large seamless and\n\u2018invisible\u2019. Lynch suggests that while coming to know via\nsuch mechanisms can make knowledge acquisition much easier, there are\nepistemic drawbacks. He offers the following thought experiment:\n\n\nNEUROMEDIA: Imagine a society where smartphones are miniaturized and\nhooked directly into a person\u2019s brain. With a single mental\ncommand, those who have this technology\u2014let\u2019s call it\nneuromedia\u2014can access information on any subject [\u2026] Now\nimagine that an environmental disaster strikes our invented society\nafter several generations have enjoyed the fruits of neuromedia. The\nelectronic communication grid that allows neuromedia to function is\ndestroyed. Suddenly no one can access the shared cloud of information\nby thought alone. [\u2026] for the inhabitants of this society,\nlosing neuromedia is an immensely unsettling experience; it\u2019s\nlike a normally sighted person going blind. They have lost a way of\naccessing information on which they\u2019ve come to rely [\u2026]\nJust as overreliance on one sense can weaken the others, so\noverdependence on neuromedia might atrophy the ability to access\ninformation in other ways, ways that are less easy and require more\ncreative effort. (Lynch 2016: 1\u20136)\n\n\nOne conclusion Lynch has drawn from such thought experiments is that\nunderstanding has a value that mere knowledge lacks, a position\nwe\u2019ve seen has been embraced for different reasons in\n \u00a74\n by Kvanvig and others. A further conclusion, advanced by Pritchard\n(2013) and Carter (2017), concerns the extent to which the acquisition\nof knowledge involves \u2018epistemic dependence\u2019\u2014viz.,\ndependence on factors outwith one\u2019s cognitive agency. They argue\nthat the greater the scope of epistemic dependence, the more valuable\nit becomes to cultivate virtues like intellectual autonomy that\nregulate the appropriate reliance and outsourcing (e.g., on other\nindividuals, technology, medicine, etc.) while at the same time\nmaintaining one\u2019s intellectual self-direction.\n",
