    "main_text": "Ontological Naturalism || The Rise of Physicalism\n1.3 The Rise of Physicalism\nThis historical sequence casts light on the evolution of\nontologically naturalist doctrines. In the initial seventeenth-century\nmechanical phase, there was a tension, as Leibniz observed, between\nthe dominant strict mechanism and interactive dualism. However, once\nmechanism was replaced by a more liberal understanding of forces in the second Newtonian phase, science ceased to raise any objections to\ndualism and more generally to non-physical causes of physical effects.\nAs a result, the default philosophical view was a non-naturalist\ninteractive pluralism which recognized a wide range of fundamental\nnon-physical influences, including spontaneous mental influences (or\n\u201cdeterminations of the soul\u201d as they would then have been\ncalled).\nIn the third phase, the nineteenth-century discovery of the\nconservation of energy continued to allow that sui generis\nnon-physical forces can interact with the physical world, but\nrequired that they be governed by strict force laws. Sui\ngeneris mental and vital forces were still widely accepted, but\nan extensive philosophical debate about the significance of the\nconservation of energy led to a widespread recognition that any such\nforces would need to be law-governed and thus amenable to scientific\ninvestigation. We might usefully view this as a species of\nontological naturalism that falls short of full physicalism.  Mental\nand other special forces were still sui generis and non-physical, but even so they fell within the realm of\nscientific law and so could not operate spontaneously. (As many commentators\nat the time recognized, this weaker form of naturalism already\ncarried significant philosophical implications, particularly for the\npossibility of free \nwill.[5]) \nIn the final twentieth-century phase, the acceptance of the causal\nclosure of the physical led to full-fledged physicalism. The causal\nclosure thesis implied that, if mental and other special causes are to\nproduce physical effects, they must themselves be physically\nconstituted. It thus gave rise to the strong physicalist doctrine that\nanything that has physical effects must itself be physical.\nIn support of this understanding of the twentieth-century history, it is\nnoteworthy how philosophical arguments in favour of physicalism began to appear from the 1950s onwards. Some of these arguments appealed\nexplicitly to the causal closure of the physical realm (Feigl 1958,\nOppenheim and Putnam 1958). In other cases, the reliance on causal\nclosure lay below the surface. However, it is not hard to see that\neven in these latter cases the causal closure thesis played a crucial\nrole.\nThus, for example, consider J.J.C. Smart\u2019s (1959) thought\nthat we should identify mental states with brain states, for otherwise\nthose mental states would be \u201cnomological danglers\u201d which\nplay no role in the explanation of behaviour. Or take David\nLewis\u2019s (1966) and David Armstrong\u2019s (1968) arguments\nthat, since mental states are picked out by their causal roles, and\nsince we know that physical states play these roles, mental states\nmust be identical with those physical states. Finally, consider Donald\nDavidson\u2019s (1970) argument that, since the only laws governing\nbehaviour are those connecting behaviour with physical antecedents,\nmental events can only be causes of behaviour if they are identical\nwith those physical antecedents. At first sight, it might not be\nobvious that these arguments require the causal closure thesis. But a\nmoment\u2019s thought will show that none of these arguments would\nremain cogent if the closure thesis were not assumed, and it were thus\nleft open that some physical effects (the movement of matter in arms,\nperhaps, or the firings of the motor neurones which instigate those\nmovements) were not determined by prior physical causes at all, but\nby sui generis mental causes.\nQuantum mechanics is often taken to involve a departure from\ndeterminism.  Sometimes it is suggested that indeterminism of this\nsort creates room for sui generis non-physical causes to\ninfluence the physical world. However, even if quantum mechanics\nimplies that some physical effects are themselves undetermined, it\nprovides no reason to doubt a quantum version of the causal closure\nthesis, to the effect that the chances of those effects are\nfully fixed by prior physical circumstances. And this alone is enough\nto rule out sui generis non-physical causes. For such sui\ngeneris causes, if they are to be genuinely efficacious, must\npresumably make an independent difference to the chances of physical\neffects, and this in itself would be inconsistent with the quantum\ncausal closure claim that such chances are already fixed by prior\nphysical circumstances. Once more, it seems that anything that makes a\ndifference to the physical realm must itself be physical.\n",
