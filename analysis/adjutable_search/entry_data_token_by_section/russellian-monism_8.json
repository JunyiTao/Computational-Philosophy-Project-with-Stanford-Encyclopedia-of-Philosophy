    "main_text": "Further Issues || Physical Quiddities\n4.3 Physical Quiddities\n\nMuch (though by no means all) of the recent discussion of Russellian\nmonism focuses on Russellian physicalism, on which quiddities are\nphysical properties. But there is no well-developed conception of\nphysical quiddities, or at least none that is widely accepted. This\nhas prompted speculation as to what such properties might be like.\n\nDerk Pereboom (2011: ch. 5) identifies some candidates for physical\nquiddities in the history of philosophy. One comes from the\nAristotelian tradition, on which matter is made up at least partly of\nprime matter. Prime materiality could be understood as a\nphysical quiddity that underlies matter, which is structural. On\nThomas Aquinas\u2019s (1252\u201356) Aristotelian view, for\ninstance, matter consists in extension in three dimensions, i.e.,\nquantity. But quantity is a form, and in Aquinas\u2019s view\na form must inhere in something. That something, he thinks, is prime\nmatter. Unlike quantity, prime materiality is not (in the terminology\nof\n section 1.1)\n a relatively intrinsic property of matter. Instead, it is an\nabsolutely intrinsic property of matter, and it could be seen as a\nphysical quiddity (Pereboom 2011: 85, 113). Admittedly, Aquinas held\nthat prime matter is unintelligible. But other Aristotelians did not\n(Pasnau 2009).\n\nAnother candidate for a physical quiddity that Pereboom identifies is\ndue to John Locke (1690). In Locke\u2019s conception,\nsolidity is the categorical basis for impenetrability, which\nis dispositional. Lockean solidity is \u201cthat which\nhinders the approach of two bodies when they move toward one\nanother\u201d (Locke 1690: II, iv, emphasis added). Lockean solidity\nis also what differentiates matter from space, and is a defining\nproperty of matter. On one plausible interpretation, Pereboom (2011:\n97\u2013100) suggests, Locke regards that property as an absolutely\nintrinsic property of matter and as a physical quiddity.\n\nA third candidate for physical quiddities, which is similar to Lockean\nsolidity, may be found in contemporary metaphysics. Many contemporary\nmetaphysicians accept that there exist non-Humean causal powers (see\nthe entry\n dispositions).\n Humeans identify causal powers with mere tendencies, which can be\nfully explicated by means of subjunctive conditionals such as,\n\u201cIf an electron were in the vicinity of a proton, it would\nattract that proton\u201d (Jacobs 2011). By contrast, non-Humeans\nidentify causal powers with properties that categorically ground\ntendencies\u2014much as Lockean solidity grounds impenetrability.\nSuch categorical properties are truthmakers for, and not explicable in\nterms of, subjunctive conditionals. For example, the causal power of\nan electron is a categorical property that makes subjunctive\nconditionals such as the one just specified (\u201cIf an\nelectron\u2026\u201d) true (Jacobs 2011; cf. Heil 2003, Jaworski\n2016). Such truthmakers could be construed as physical quiddities\n(Gundersen 2015, Pereboom 2016, 2019).\n\nSo, there are at least some candidates for what physical quiddities\nmight be like (for others, see, e.g., Chalmers 2013 [esp. 2015:\n270\u2013274]; Rosenberg 2004; Coleman 2012, 2015). Still, one might\nwonder if any of the candidates just described\u2014Aristotelian\nprime materiality, Lockean solidity, or non-Humean causal\npowers\u2014can serve all of the Russellian physicalist\u2019s\npurposes. Russellian physicalists argue that positing physical\nquiddities safeguards their theory from the conceivability and\nknowledge arguments\n (section 3.1).\n But suppose those quiddities are construed as non-Humean causal\npowers of physical entities such as electrons. Wouldn\u2019t Mary be\nin a position to fully understand such powers while she is still in\nthe room? (Pereboom 2011: 113\u2013114). If so, then the proposed\nconstrual would seem to undermine the Russellian physicalist\u2019s\nbasis for denying that her pre-release physical knowledge is\nincomplete. Similarly, one might argue that the proposed construal\nwould undermine the Russellian physicalist\u2019s contention that\nwhile a structural zombie world is ideally conceivable, a full-fledged\nzombie world is not. Parallel concerns arise for Aristotelian prime\nmateriality and Lockean solidity. Even if those properties could be\nconstrued as physical quiddities, they would not appear to facilitate\nthe Russellian physicalist\u2019s objective of providing a plausible\nresponse to the conceivability and knowledge arguments (cf. Botin\n2023).\n",
