    "main_text": "\n\nA cause is regularly followed by its effect. This idea is at the core\nof regularity theories of causation. The most influential regularity\ntheory can be found in Hume (1739). The theory has been refined by\nMill (1843) who insisted that the relevant regularities are laws of\nnature. Further refinements used to enjoy popularity until David Lewis\n(1973) criticized the regularity theory and proposed an analysis of\ncausation in terms of counterfactuals (see the entry on\n counterfactual theories of causation).\n Since then, counterfactual theories of causation have risen and\nregularity theories have more and more fallen into disuse.\n\nRegularities are closely tied to inferences. When a cause is\ninvariably followed by its effect, it is reasonable to infer the\neffect from the cause. In the wake of logical empiricism and logical\napproaches to belief change, theories that explicitly analyse\ncausation in terms of inference relations have cropped up. The basic\nidea is that effects are inferable from corresponding causes in the\ncontext of a suitable background theory using a suitable logic.\nInferential theories offer solutions to the problems which were\ndecisive for the decline of regularity theories. Such theories may\nthus be seen as successors of the regularity theories.\n",
