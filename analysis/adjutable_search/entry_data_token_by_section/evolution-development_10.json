    "main_text": "Anthropological and ethical dimensions of developmental evolution\n7. Concluding Remarks\n\nThe relationship between evolution and development has been a long\ndebated topic in the history of biology and philosophy of biology.\nThis entry has sampled a small portion of work relevant to the\nconceptual, epistemological, anthropological and ethical reflections\non this relationship. Besides the issues discussed here, philosophers\nof biology and biologists have discussed how developmental and\nphylogenetic approaches to homology can be integrated (Amundson 2004;\nWagner 2014; DiFrisco 2019; see the entry\n developmental biology),\n what model organisms (Love 2009; Lloyd et al. 2012; Minelli & Baedke 2014; Zuk et al.\n2014; see entry\n developmental biology)\n and representational tools scientists (should) use for studying\nrelationships between evolution and development (e.g., normal plates,\ncell fate maps, epigenetic landscapes) and what the epistemic and\nheuristic roles of these tools in scientific practice are (see Haraway\n1976; Gilbert 1991; Hopwood 2007; Love 2010; Baedke 2013; Baedke &\nSch\u00f6ttler 2017; Nicoglou 2018). In addition, long standing\ndebates on teleology in biology (see the entry\n teleological notions in biology)\n drew on the relation between evolution and development to distinguish\nthe teleological dimension of development from non-teleological\nevolutionary processes (Mayr 1961), to introduce new conceptual\nframeworks, like teleonomy, which refer to only apparently purposeful\nsystems (Pittendrigh 1958), or to highlight the purposeful acting\norganismic agent as a starting point to reason about the teleological\nnature of evolution (Russell 1950; Piaget 1976 [1978]; Walsh\n2015).\n\nAt the moment, philosophical debates about the appropriate conceptual\nand explanatory approach to combine or integrate developmental and\nevolutionary processes have not reached a consensus. This is not least\ndue to the fact that the relevant disciplinary fields, such as\nevo-devo, epigenetics and niche construction theory, which foster such\nintegration, are still relatively young. Their theoretical and\nconceptual frameworks are highly heterogeneous. Thus, important aims\nfor future philosophical research is to understand obstacles for the\nstabilization and solidification of these frameworks, to identify\ntheir explanatory virtues and limitations, as well as to call\nattention to their effects on how we understand humans and human\nhealth. \n",
