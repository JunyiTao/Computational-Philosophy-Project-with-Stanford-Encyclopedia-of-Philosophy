    "main_text": "The Nature of Film\n2. The Nature of Film\n\n\nThe question that dominated early philosophical inquiry into film was\nwhether the cinema\u2014a term that emphasizes the institutional\nstructure within which films were produced, distributed, and\nviewed\u2014could be regarded as an artform.  There were two reasons\nwhy cinema did not seem worthy of the honorific designation of an\nart. The first was that early contexts for the exhibition of films\nincluded such venues as the vaudeville peep show and the circus side\nshow. As a popular cultural form, film seemed to have a vulgarity that\nmade it an unsuitable companion to theater, painting, opera, and the\nother fine arts. A second problem was that film seemed to borrow too\nmuch from other art forms. To many, early films seemed little more\nthan recordings of either theatrical performances or everyday\nlife. The rationale for the former was that they could be disseminated\nto a wider audience than that which could see a live performance. But\nfilm then only seems to be a means of access to art and not an\nindependent art form on its own. The latter, on the other hand, seemed\ntoo direct a reproduction of life to qualify as art, for there seemed\nlittle mediation by any guiding consciousness.\n\n\nIn order to justify the claim that film deserves to be considered an\nindependent art form, philosophers investigated the ontological\nstructure of film. The hope was to develop a conception of film that\nmade it clear that it differed in significant ways from the other fine\narts. For this reason, the question of film's nature was a crucial one\nfor theorists of film during what we might call the classic\nperiod.\n\n\nHugo M\u00fcnsterberg, the first philosopher to write a monograph\nabout the new art form, sought to distinguish film by means of the\ntechnical devices that it employed in presenting its\nnarratives (M\u00fcnsterberg 1916). Flashbacks, close-ups,\nand edits are some examples of the technical means that filmmakers\nemploy to present their narratives that theater lacks. For\nM\u00fcnsterberg, the use of these devices distinguished film from the\ntheater as an artform.\n\n\nM\u00fcnsterberg went on to ask how viewers are able to understand the\nrole that these technical devices play in the articulation of\ncinematic narratives. His answer is that these devices are all\nobjectifications of mental processes. A close-up, for example,\npresents in visual form a correlate to the mental act of paying\nattention to something. Viewers naturally understand how such\ncinematic devices function because they are familiar with the workings\nof their own minds and can recognize these objectified mental\nfunctions when they see them. Although this aspect of\nM\u00fcnsterberg's theory links him to contemporary cognitive\nphilosophers of film, he does not explain how viewers know that what\nthey are looking at are objectified mental functions.\n\n\nM\u00fcnsterberg was writing during the silent era.  The development\nof the simultaneous sound track\u2014the\n\u201ctalkie\u201d\u2014changed film forever. It is not surprising\nthat this important innovation spawned interesting theoretical\nreflections.\n\n\nThe well-known psychologist of art, Rudolph Arnheim, made the\nsurprising claim that the talkie represented a decline from the\nhighpoint of silent cinema. (Arnheim 1957) Relying on the idea\nthat, in order to be a unique artform, film had to be true to its own\nspecific medium, Arnheim denigrates the sound film as a mixture of two\ndistinct artistic media that do not constitute a satisfying whole.\n\n\nFor Arnheim, the silent film had achieved artistic status by focusing\non its ability to present moving bodies. Indeed, for him, the artistic\naspect of cinema consisted in its ability to present abstractions, an\nability completely lost when films began to employ simultaneous\nsoundtracks. Writing near the dawn of the talkie, Arnheim could only\nsee what we now recognize as a natural development of the artform as a\ndecline from a previously attained height.\n\n\nAndr\u00e9 Bazin, though not a professional philosopher or even an\nacademic, countered Arnheim's assessment in a series of articles that\nstill exert an important influence on the field. (Bazin 1967;\n1971) For Bazin, the important dichotomy is not that between the sound\nand the silent film but rather between films that focus on the image\nand those that emphasize reality. Although editing had emerged for\nmany such as Sergei Eisenstein as the distinctive aspect of film,\nBazin returns to the silent era to demonstrate the presence of an\nalternative means of achieving film art, namely an interest in\nallowing the camera to reveal the actual nature of the world. Relying\non a conception of film as having a realist character because of its\nbasis in photography, Bazin argues that the future of cinema as an\nartform depends on its development of this capacity to present the\nworld to us \u201cfrozen in time.\u201d\n\n\nIn making his argument, Bazin valorizes the film style he dubs\nrealism, characterized by extended shots and deep focus. Jean Renoir,\nOrson Welles, and the Italian neo-Realists are the filmmakers whom\nBazin sees as culminating this imagist tradition of filmmaking that\nhas realized the true potential of the medium.\n\n\nIn his pathbreaking study of what he called \u201cclassical film\ntheory,\u201d No\u00ebl Carroll (1988) argued that there were many illicit\npresuppositions at play in the classical theorists' attempts to define\nfilm's nature. In particular, he accused them of confusing particular\nstyles of filmmaking with more abstract claims about the nature of the\nmedium itself. His accusations seemed to spell the end of such\nattempts to justify film styles by their grounding in the medium's\nnature.\nRecently, however, Bazin's claim about film's realism has received\nnew life, albeit without the extravagances of Bazin's own writing.\nKendall Walton, in an extremely influential paper (1984), argued that\nfilm, because of its basis in photography, was a realistic medium that\nallowed viewers to actually see the objects that appear on screen.\nThe transparency thesis has been the subject of a great deal\nof debate among philosophers and aestheticians.  Gregory Currie, for\nexample, rejects the transparency thesis while still defending a form\nof realism.  He argues that film's realism is the result of the fact\nthat objects depicted on screen trigger the same recognitional\ncapacities that are used to identify real objects.  \nThe discussion of the realist character of film continues to be a\ntopic of heated debate among philosophers of film.  Most recently,\nthe emergence of digital technologies for\nfashioning the image raise very basic questions about the plausibility\nof this view.\n",
