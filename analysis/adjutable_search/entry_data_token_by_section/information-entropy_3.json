    "main_text": "Statistical Mechanics and the Second Law\n2. Statistical Mechanics and the Second Law\n\n\nThe literature devoted to analysing the second law of thermodynamics\nin the context of statistical mechanics starts with the development of\nstatistical mechanics in the late 19th century. Considerable confusion\nhas arisen simply due to the fact that as the subject has developed,\nthe meaning of key terms have changed or become ambiguous. When one\npaper speaks of the second law being violated or of entropy decreasing\nand another of it being saved or being non-decreasing, it is not\nnecessarily the case that they are referring to the same things. While\na review of the foundations of thermal physics is beyond the scope of\nthis entry (though see related entries by\n Sklar\n and\n Uffink),\n some important distinctions\nneed be borne in mind.\n",
