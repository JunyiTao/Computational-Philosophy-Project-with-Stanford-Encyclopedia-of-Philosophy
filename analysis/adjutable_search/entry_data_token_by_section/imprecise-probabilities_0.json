    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\nProbability theory has been a remarkably fruitful theory, with\napplications in almost every branch of science. In philosophy, some\nimportant applications of probability theory go by the name\nBayesianism; this has been an extremely successful\nprogram (see for example Howson and Urbach\n2006; Bovens and Hartmann 2003; Talbott 2008). But probability\ntheory seems to impute much richer and more determinate attitudes than\nseems warranted. What should your rational degree of belief be that\nglobal mean surface temperature will have risen by more than four\ndegrees by 2080? Perhaps it should be 0.75? Why not 0.75001? Why not\n0.7497? Is that event more or less likely than getting at least one\nhead on two tosses of a fair coin? It seems there are many events\nabout which we can (or perhaps should) take less precise attitudes\nthan orthodox probability requires. Among the reasons to question the\northodoxy, it seems that the insistence that states of belief be\nrepresented by a single real-valued probability function is quite an\nunrealistic idealisation, and one that brings with it some rather\nawkward consequences that we shall discuss later. Indeed, it has long\nbeen recognised that probability theory offers only a rather idealised\nmodel of belief. As far back as the mid-nineteenth century, we find\nGeorge Boole saying:\n\nIt would be unphilosophical to affirm that the strength of that\nexpectation, viewed as an emotion of the mind, is capable of being\nreferred to any numerical standard. (Boole 1958\n[1854]: 244)\n\nFor these, and many other reasons, there is growing interest\nin Imprecise Probability (IP) models. Broadly construed,\nthese are models of belief that go beyond the probabilistic orthodoxy\nin one way or another.\nIP models are used in a number of fields including:\n\nStatistics (Walley 1991; Ruggeri et al. 2005; Augustin et\nal. 2014)\nPsychology of reasoning (Pfeifer and\nKleiter 2007)\nLinguistic processing of\nuncertainty (Wallsten and Budescu\n1995)\nNeurological response to ambiguity and\nconflict (Smithson and Pushkarskaya\n2015)\nPhilosophy (Levi 1980; Joyce 2011; Sturgeon\n2008; Kaplan 1983; Kyburg 1983)\nBehavioural economics (Ellsberg 1961;\nCamerer and Weber 1992; Smithson and Campbell 2009)\nMathematical economics (Gilboa\n1987)\nEngineering (Ferson and Ginzburg 1996; Ferson and Hajagos 2004;\nOberguggenberger 2014)\nComputer science (Cozman 2000; Cozman and\nWalley 2005)\nScientific computing (Oberkampf and Roy 2010, chapter 13)\nPhysics (Suppes and Zanotti 1991; Hartmann\nand Suppes 2010; Frigg et al. 2014)\n\nThis article identifies a variety of motivations for IP models;\nintroduces various formal models that are broadly in this area; and\ndiscusses some open problems for these frameworks. The focus will be\non formal models of belief.\n",
