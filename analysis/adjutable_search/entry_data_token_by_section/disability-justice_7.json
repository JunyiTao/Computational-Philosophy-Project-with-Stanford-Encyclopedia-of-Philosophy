    "main_text": "Disability in Contemporary Theories of Justice || The Appropriate Standard for Distributive Justice\n4.4 The Appropriate Standard for Distributive Justice\n\nTwo approaches seek to moderate the ambitions of distributive justice\nin ways that may be more inclusive of people with disabilities. One\ntakes the end-state of justice not as equality or priority but\nsufficiency: it requires that every member of society reach some\nminimum in the appropriate \u201ccurrency\u201d. This approach,\nlabeled \u201csufficientarian\u201d by one critic (Arneson 2006), is\nsuggested but not endorsed by Nussbaum, and it serves to make\ncapabilities a less demanding metric for distributive justice.\n(Nussbaum notes that certain capabilities must be distributed equally\nif anyone is to have a sufficient level of them, e.g., voting rights.)\nThe requirement that a just society ensure that every citizen reaches\na minimum level of each capability may be far less demanding than the\nrequirement of equal capabilities. One way of setting the minimum\nappeals to the requirements for participation in a democratic society\n(Gutmann 1987; Anderson 1999).\n\nAlthough sufficientarian approaches claim to make the demands of\njustice less oppressive, they have been criticized as demanding both too\nmuch and too little. They demand too much if the minimum for every\ncapability must be met in the face of recalcitrant impairments or\nenvironments. They demand too little if attaining the minimum could\nstill leave the individual with a miserable life (Arneson 2006;\nWasserman 2006; Wolff and de-Shalit 2007). Those approaches have also\nbeen criticized for lacking a mechanism for prioritizing capabilities\n(Wolff and de-Shalit 2007) and for assessing whether the minimum has\nbeen reached for any one capability (Riddle 2010). Clearly, the extent\nto which justice is achievable on such approaches for people with\nsevere disabilities will depend on where the minimum is set, how its\nsatisfaction is assessed, and how the capabilities are defined.\n\nA second approach would replace equality on a specific metric of\nadvantage with social equality or equality of respect (Anderson 1999;\nMiller 1999; Norman 1997, 1999). This approach would involve a more\nradical departure from luck egalitarianism than a sufficiency account,\nsince it does not lower the standard for a just distribution so much\nas propose a non-distributive standard for justice. That standard\nwould see justice in terms of recognition rather than, or as well as,\nredistribution. Although this approach may demand strict equality of a\nsort, it is a sort that does not appear to set determinate\ndistributive requirements. A society of social equals, abounding in\nmutual respect, can arguably tolerate significant disparities in\nwelfare, resources, opportunities, or capabilities.\n\nUnderlying this approach is the more fundamental distinction between\nrelational and distributive theories of justice. Although this\ndistinction can be drawn in different ways (see, e.g.,\nLippert-Rasmussen 2015, Fourie et al. 2015), it identifies two\ncritical dimensions of justice. One concerns how well-off individual\npeople are, both absolutely and in comparison to each other. The other\nconcerns the kinds of social relationships people stand in to one\nanother. As discussed in\n \u00a74.3,\n it is a difficult question to what extent either dimension of justice\ncan be reduced to, or expressed in terms of, the other.\n\nAgainst the claim that relational justice can be understood as an\ninstance of distributive justice, one may observe that at least with\nrespect to equality, there seems to be an important\nstructural difference between two people standing in some\nrelation to some third thing (i.e., some good) to the same\ndegree and two people standing in some relation to one\nanother to the same degree (e.g., the relation of being\nrespected, recognized, and so on). Insofar as interpersonal equality\nhas a different structure when construed as relational, it is a\nmistake to think that it can be reduced to a species of distributive\nequality, for \u201cequal\u201d means something different in each\ncase. For example, it is one thing for any two people in society to\nhave equal respect from others; it is a different thing for\nany two people in society to have equal respect for one\nanother. This distinction is relevant to debates about disability\nin particular, because one way to understand the social model is in\nterms of the relational view\u2014its core insight is that disability\nis not a one-place property of individuals, defined in terms of some\nwelfare deficit, but an n-place relation between individuals (n>2)\ndefined by stigmatizing or excluding attitudes, dispositions,\npractices, and forms of treatment.\n\nSome of these issues have taken center-stage in a recent debate over\nthe expressive significance of different measures to remediate the\ndisadvantages associated with disability. Pogge (2002) and Anderson\n(1999) have claimed that it is disrespectful to attribute a\nperson\u2019s disadvantage to features of his or her natural\nendowment because it treats her as needy, deficient, or inferior. For\nthis reason, they argue against justifying redistributive measures to\nachieve inclusion on the grounds that they correct natural\ninequalities in skills, talents, or the ability to convert resources\ninto welfare. Instead, they contend that such measures can and should\nbe justified as redressing discrimination, and conversely, that\nfailures to achieve inclusion should be recognized as unjustly\ndiscriminatory.\n\nBarclay (2010, 2018) challenges the argument that a claim for\nredistribution treats the claimant as deficient or inferior. Such\nclaims need only recognize that some traits are less suited than\nothers for specific environments\u2014a contingency that does not\nimply the intrinsic superiority or inferiority of a given endowment.\nShe thus questions those (e.g, Daniels 1985; Buchanan et al. 2000) who\nclaim that certain characteristics or traits are universally valuable,\nsuch that an individual who lacked them would be deficient in any\nenvironment. Although she tends to see the environment as fixed rather\nthan malleable, Barclay argues that the project of achieving inclusion\nis best seen in terms of maximizing individuals\u2019 environmental\nfit. Achieving that fit may require expending more resources for some\nindividuals than others in any given environment. The demands made by\nvery tall or left-handed people for greater accommodation do not\npresuppose their inferiority, only their minority status (see\n \u00a72,\n infra). These comparisons suggest that the demands for accommodation\nof people with such statistically atypical features differ merely in\ndegree, not kind, from those made by people with various\nimpairments.\n\nEven if compensation for disadvantage need bit be demeaning, however,\nspecific grounds for compensation may well be. Laws and policies that\ncompensate people simply because they are disabled, or have a specific\ndisability, may be objectionable because of the social meaning of\ndisability-compensation. Compensation that is based on the medical\nclassification of disability may reinforce the humanity-obscuring\nstereotype of \u201cthe cripple\u201d as helpless and pitiable. This\ngrave threat to social equality should make us wary of drawing\ndistributive implications from the claim that disability is a\n\u201cbad difference\u201d rather than a \u201cmere difference\n\u201c(see entry, \u201cDisability: Well-Being, Health, and Personal\nRelationships\u201d). Even if disability in general, or specific\ndisabilities, were bad differences, that would hardly imply that\nindividuals who had (those) disabilities were entitled to compensation\nsimply by virtue of that fact.\n",
