    "main_text": "Conceptions of privacy and the value of privacy\n1. Conceptions of privacy and the value of privacy\n\nDiscussions about privacy are intertwined with the use of technology.\nThe publication that began the debate about privacy in the Western\nworld was occasioned by the introduction of the newspaper printing\npress and photography. Samuel D. Warren and Louis Brandeis wrote their\narticle on privacy in the Harvard Law Review (Warren & Brandeis\n1890) partly in protest against the intrusive activities of the\njournalists of those days. They argued that there is a \u201cright to\nbe left alone\u201d based on a principle of \u201cinviolate\npersonality\u201d. Since the publication of that article, the debate\nabout privacy has been fuelled by claims regarding the right of\nindividuals to determine the extent to which others have access to\nthem (Westin 1967) and claims regarding the right of society to know\nabout individuals. Information being a cornerstone of access to\nindividuals, the privacy debate has co-evolved with \u2013 and in\nresponse to \u2013 the development of information technology. It is\ntherefore difficult to conceive of the notions of privacy and\ndiscussions about data protection as separate from the way computers,\nthe Internet, mobile computing and the many applications of these\nbasic technologies have evolved.\n",
