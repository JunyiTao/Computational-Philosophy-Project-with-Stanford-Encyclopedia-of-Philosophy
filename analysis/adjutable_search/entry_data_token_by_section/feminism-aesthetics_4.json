The Body in Art and Philosophy\n\nPossibly there is no topic more discussed in feminist art and\nphilosophy today than \u201cthe body.\u201d This interest represents\ncontinued explorations and critiques of traditional mind-body dualism,\nthe role of sexual morphology in the development of gender and the\nself, and the venerable association of women with matter and\nphysicality. All these subjects link gender analysis to the history of\nphilosophical concepts, both in the west (which most of this entry has\nemphasized) and in eastern traditions (Man 2000, 2015, 2016). Both the\nartistic and the theoretical modes of exploration of the body can be\nviewed as complementary elements of feminist aesthetics. This topic\ncovers very broad territory and includes the mutual involvement of\naesthetic norms with ethical judgments; aesthetic standards and\nimplications about bodies that appear deviant from standard concepts\nof \u201cnormal\u201d; and the participation of the bodily senses in\naesthetic appreciation (Irvin 2016).\n\nTo begin with the last topic mentioned above: Both artists and\nphilosophers have reevaluated the senses and the orthodox materials\nthat are fashioned into objects of art. As we saw when considering\nphilosophies of taste and the formation of the idea of the aesthetic,\nthe literal sense of taste has customarily never been considered a\ntruly \u201caesthetic\u201d sense, its pleasures and mode of\napprehension being too bodily and sensuous to qualify. Vision and\nhearing are the aesthetic senses proper, according to traditional\ntheory. This judgment is under question now, as the senses themselves\nare under reevaluation (Howes 1991). Early speculation about the\npossible gendering of sense experience was ventured by theorists such\nas Irigaray and Cixous, and a number of artists indirectly probe the\nissue by employing foodstuffs as the medium for their works (Korsmeyer\n2004, chs. 4\u20135). The presence of actual food\u2014as opposed to\nthe depictions of still life painting\u2014in art installations\nconfounds traditional aesthetic ideals on a number of fronts. It\nchallenges the idea that art has lasting value, because it literally\ndecays. And while such art is to be viewed, it synaesthetically teases\nthe senses of taste and smell as well. But it often does so without\nthe benefits that actual eating provides, for art made from food is\nnot necessarily itself a meal. In fact, rather than pleasing to the\nsense of taste, this art frequently trades on the arousal of disgust\nin the sensuous imagination. (Janine Antoni, for example, has\nfashioned large sculptures from lard and from chocolate, employing her\nmouth, teeth, and tongue as the carving tools. Hardly appealing to the\ngustatory sense, this work nonetheless arouses a somatic response at\nthe same time that it invites rumination on the venerable hierarchy of\nthe senses that puts the distance senses of sight and hearing above\nthe bodily senses of touch, smell, and taste.)\n\nA number of artists today are using food that can be eaten, inviting\nthe public into a participatory relationship with their works (Smith\n2013). The uses of food on the part of female artists are particularly\nsignificant, given the traditional association of women with the body,\nwith feeding and nurturance, and with transience and mortality. Not\nonly these venerable concepts but also the versions they manifest in\nthe contemporary social order are present in today\u2019s art scene,\nsuch as Kara Walker\u2019s 2014 work A Subtlety, a giant\nsculpture of sugar and molasses that explores eroticism, race, and the\nlegacies of American slavery (Davidson 2016). The very presence of\nsuch creations in the artworld today has contributed to consternation\non the part of professionals and public alike about just how art is to\nbe defined and conceived. There is no particular feminist\n\u201cdefinition\u201d of art, but there are many uses to which\nfeminists and postfeminists turn their creative efforts: exploring\ngender and sexuality as well as criticizing the traditions of art and\nof beauty imposed by aesthetic standards of the past.\n\nThe sense of taste is but one zone where the aesthetic dimensions of\nbodily sensation are recognized and explored, in dramatic contrast to\nthe traditional idea that aesthetic \u201cdistance\u201d is required\nfor the true apprehension of art. Erotic desires, sexuality, and\nbodily sensation in general are increasingly central elements both of\nart and of aesthetic discourse, and feminist investigators have been\namong the important contributors to this movement (Lintott 2003; Lorde\n2007; Grosz 2008; Lintott and Irvin 2016).\n\nCritical consideration of norms of female beauty and the artistic\ndepiction of women influences the ways that feminist artists employ\ntheir own bodies in creating art (Brand 2000, 2013; Steiner 2001;\nBanes 1998). The work of artists across the globe utilizes bodies in\ndifferent cultural and political contexts, dramatizing the recognition\nprevalent in contemporary feminist theory that there is no such thing\nas the female body, only bodies marked by the differences of\ntheir historical situation, their geographical location, their social\nposition, their race (Hobson 2005; Tate 2009; Roelofs et al 2009;\nTaylor 2016). A wide spectrum of identities and desires are explored\nin text, image, and performance, including sexual\nmorphology\u2014transgender, female, male, intersex. Revaluation of bodies\nwith abilities and disabilities represents yet another way in which\naesthetic investigations have political impact (Silvers 2000;\nMillett-Gallant 2010; Siebers 2010). The most dramatic uses of\nartists\u2019 bodies occur with the relatively new genre of\nperformance art, in which feminists have been pioneers.\n\nA good deal of performance art has been highly controversial, partly\nbecause of the exposure of the bodies of the artists in ways that not\nonly challenge norms of female beauty but are deliberately gross or\neven borderline pornographic. The art tradition was long accustomed to\npictures of nude females arranged in alluring poses. A performance\nartist who manipulates her body in ways that reverse the values of\nthat tradition confronts the audience with a direct and emotionally\ndifficult challenge to those values. Karen Finley, to mention a\nwell-known case, called attention to the sexual exploitation of women\nby smearing her body with foodstuffs resembling blood and excrement.\nThis is an especially political use of disgust\u2014an emotion that\nin earlier times was explicitly precluded from aesthetic arousal but\nthat has become a major feature of the comprehension and appreciation\nof contemporary art (Korsmeyer 2011). What at first disgusts, however,\nmay come to lose its stigma, and displays of the body are also\ndeployed to induce acceptance. Regarding what at first appear as\ndisfigurements with aesthetic openness can broaden both our\nsensibilities and our social horizons (Irvin 2017; Protasi 2017).\nArtists have contributed to changes in the social imagination about\ngender fluidity. While the concept of the sexed body has seemed in the\npast to be dictated by nature, transgender and non-binary artists are\namong those who challenge the idea that morphology at birth must\ndetermine the course of one\u2019s life (Mostovoy in Brand Weiser\n2018; Vaid-Menon 2020).\n\nFeminist explorations of embodiment and the deliberate arousal of\ndisgust as an aesthetic response have at least two kinds of political\nand philosophical import. First of all, they invert feminine ideals\nthat frame restrictive norms for personal appearance. This can be done\nhumorously, boldly, sadly, aggressively, casually; much depends on the\nindividual work. There are numerous ways to challenge the traditional\naesthetic values expected in the female body, with disturbing\nemotional effects that make the audience question those values and\ntheir comprehensiveness. In addition, the arousal of disgust often\noccurs when artists move from consideration of the exterior of the\nbody to its warm, dark, sticky interior where unmentionable substances\nare kept hidden away. The deliberate cultivation of that which is not\npretty but is grossly material is the occasion for presenting formerly\ntaboo aspects of bodies: menstrual blood, excrement, internal organs.\nFemale artists are not the only ones who explore interiority and\nmateriality in art, of course. However, because of the traditional\nlinkage of gross matter with the \u201cfeminine\u201d (now the\nterrible feminine, not the highly socialized feminine of Burke\u2019s\nbeauty principle), when female artists explore such themes they cannot\nbut allude to venerable conceptual frameworks. This is a complex and\ndelicate territory for feminist investigation: the ancient category of\nthe feminine that includes the element of untamed nature and the gross\nmatter of existence. Feminist uses of these types of objects play upon\nmyths of nature and culture, of horror and sublimity, and of death and\nlife. Rather than keeping these themes in the uncanny but clean realms\nof myth, however, the presentation of entrails, blood,\nand\u2014sometimes literally\u2014flesh confronts the audience with\na particular and disturbing presence of the artist herself. Indeed,\nsuch theorizing extends beyond art into lived reality with\nphilosophical attention to such intrinsically female events as\nchildbirth, a transformative experience in which some theorists find\nelements of the sublime (Lintott 2011).\n\nThe provocative ideas of French philosopher and psychoanalyst Luce\nIrigaray have provided inspiration for a number of feminist artists\nwho seek to bring forth a \u201csexuate\u201d perspective in their\nwork that does not borrow from the patriarchal tradition, for the\nlatter, according to Irigaray, has always eclipsed the expression of\nthe \u201cfeminine.\u201d The body and its morphology are central to\nIrigaray\u2019s philosophical method, as she insists that sexuate\nbeing pervades one\u2019s existence, and that the pretense of\nshedding one\u2019s sex when writing or speaking in standard,\nfamiliar idioms and syntax causes the feminine to disappear into the\nmasculine/neutral discourse that dominates the patriarchal order. As\nshe puts it in the title of one of her widely-read essays, \u201cAny\ntheory of the subject has always been appropriated by the\nmasculine\u201d (Irigaray 1974 [1985: 133]). One of Irigaray\u2019s\nprojects is to evoke feminine subjectivity that can be represented in\nits own terms, not just as an absence in the symbolic order. While the\nintricacies of her philosophy are opaque and sometimes difficult to\npin down, her suggestive ideas have furnished inspiration for many\nfeminist artists. The psychoanalytic work of Bracha Ettinger\nconcerning subjectivity and gendered consciousness is equally\ndeveloped in her writings and in her visual art and indeed can be\nconsidered as much theory as aesthetic production (Ettinger 2006;\nPollock 2008).\n\nFeminist interpretive theories include approaches that are both\ncompeting and complementary, and they represent some of the same\nrivalries that are present in contemporary philosophy, broadly\nconstrued. Adaptations of psychoanalytic theory have an especially\nlarge presence in the interpretation of performance, literature, film\nand visual arts. Some feminists employ the discourse of Jacques Lacan,\nwhose concept of the symbolic order has been widely applied to\nunderstand the power of patriarchy embedded in cultural forms of every\nkind (Copjec 2002). Julia Kristeva, who analyzes the artistic\nexperience of \u201cabjection\u201d as a threat to self arising from\nboth the allure and the horror of self-disintegration and reabsorption\ninto the body of the mother, has been especially provocative for\nunderstanding the aesthetic arousal of disgust and the strong sexual\nand gendered elements of horror (Kristeva 1982; Creed 1993, Ortega\n2019a). Far from a mere application of a theory to aesthetics, the\nfeminist uses of abjection have explored and enlarged the concept in\norder to understand not only the psychological development of\nindividuals but also the construction of social and political\nrelations (Chanter 2008).\n\nThe uses of psychoanalytic theory in aesthetics mark an area of\ncontroversy that is importantly discipline-based. Many philosophers,\nespecially those of the analytic and postanalytic traditions, reject\nthe assumptions required by these approaches as empirically baseless\nand theoretically otiose. They argue that empirical, particularist\nanalyses of individual works have more explanatory power to illuminate\nthe positions that gender manifests in art (Freeland 1998a, 1998b;\nCarroll 1995). Thus differences over interpretive theory represent\ndivisions both within philosophy itself and in transdisciplinary\nscholarship. Debates over appropriate tools to understand the meaning\nof art and the power of culture should lay to rest once and for all\nany idea that \u201cfeminist aesthetics\u201d describes a unitary\nset of ideas.\n",
