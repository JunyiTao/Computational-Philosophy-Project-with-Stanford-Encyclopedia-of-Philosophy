    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nEverett developed his relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics\nwhile a graduate student in physics at Princeton University. The short\nversion of his doctoral thesis (1957a) was accepted in March 1957 and\na paper (1957b) covering essentially the same material was published\nin July of the same year. The short version of his thesis was revised\nfrom a longer draft thesis that Everett had given John Wheeler, his\nPh.D. adviser, in January 1956 under the title \u201cWave Mechanics\nWithout Probability\u201d. DeWitt and Graham (1973) later published a\nversion of the long thesis in an anthology of papers on\nEverett\u2019s theory. While Everett always favored the description\nof the theory as presented in the long thesis, in part because of\nBohr\u2019s disapproval of Everett\u2019s critical approach, Wheeler\ninsisted on the revisions that led to the much shorter version that\nEverett ultimately defended.\n\nEverett took a job outside academics as a defense analyst in the\nspring of 1956. Subsequent notes and letters indicate that he\ncontinued to be interested in the conceptual problems of quantum\nmechanics and in the reception of his theory, but he did not take an\nactive role in the debates surrounding either. Everett died in 1982.\nSee Byrne (2007) and (2010) for further biographical details and\nBarrett and Byrne (2012) for an annotated collection of\nEverett\u2019s papers, notes, and letters regarding quantum\nmechanics. See also Osnaghi, Freitas, Freire (2009) for an excellent\nintroduction to the history of Everett\u2019s formulation of quantum\nmechanics.\n\nEverett\u2019s relative state formulation was a direct reaction to\nthe measurement problem faced by the standard von Neumann collapse\nformulation of quantum mechanics. Everett understood the measurement\nproblem in the context of his own version of the Wigner\u2019s Friend\nstory, a version published four years before Wigner\u2019s (1961). In\nbrief, Everett\u2019s solution to the problem was to drop the\ncollapse postulate from the standard formulation of quantum mechanics\nthen deduce the empirical predictions of the standard collapse theory\nas the subjective experiences of observers who were themselves modeled\nas physical systems in the theory. The result was his relative-state\ninterpretation of pure wave mechanics.\n\nIn order to understand Everett\u2019s solution to the quantum\nmeasurement problem, it is helpful first to understand just what he\ntook the problem to be. We will start with this, then consider his\npresentation of the relative-state formulation of pure wave mechanics\nand the sense in which he took it to solve the quantum measurement\nproblem. We will then consider how one might get a theory that\nprovides a richer account of determinate quantum records and\nprobabilities.\n",
