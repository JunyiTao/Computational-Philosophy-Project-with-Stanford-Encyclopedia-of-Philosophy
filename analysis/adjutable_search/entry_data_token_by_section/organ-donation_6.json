    "main_text": "Organ Retrieval from Living Donors || The moral force of consent\n2.3 The moral force of consent\n\nAssuming a potential donor would give valid consent, how far would\nthat justify retrieval of organs? The \u201cdo no harm\u201d rule\nimplies that people should not be harmed even with their consent\nalthough, as was said earlier, some living organ donation may not harm\nthe donor all-things-considered. Suppose a man wanted to donate his\nsecond kidney to his second son, having already donated a kidney to\nanother son, thus paying the price of a life on dialysis. Suppose a\nparent wanted to donate her heart to her child, thus causing her own\ndeath. Would transplant teams act wrongly if they took organs in such\ncases? And\u2014what is a separate question\u2014should they be\nallowed to?\n\nIt cannot be assumed that, in these desperate cases, the parents would\nbe all-things-considered harmed by retrieval. Whether they are would\ndepend on how the correct specification of harm handles vicarious\nharms and psychosocial harms. Perhaps a parent could be better off\ndead than to have to live without her child (which is not to say that\nher reason to donate is self-interest).\n\nSuppose, though, that genuinely consensual organ retrieval would\nall-things-considered harm the donor. One way to try to decide when\nretrieval should nonetheless be permitted is to compare the values of\nautonomy with well-being. The question would then become an aspect of\nfamiliar debates about paternalism and the limits of consent. Living\ndonation does have the unusual twist that, if one were to prevent\ndonation, one would prevent an act of considerable value to a badly\noff person, the potential recipient. Moreover, to prevent living\ndonation would be dissimilar to many acts of state paternalism, such\nas mandatory wearing of seat belts or the prohibition of certain\ndrugs, in that donating an organ would not generally be the result of\ninattention, weak-will, addiction, or excessive short-sightedness.\nBecause of its value to the recipient and because donors\u2019\nchoices are not obviously flawed, living donation of the sorts that\nactually take place should be allowed and seems ethically\npermissible.\n\nWhat about organ donation that goes beyond what is currently\npermitted, such as the donation of the second kidney or donation of an\norgan necessary for life? Liberal democracies do not generally allow\nconsent to be a defense to bodily harm at or well below the level of\ndeath (Price 2000), but should they? The answer turns in part on how\nfar third parties\u2014transplant teams in this case\u2014may\ninflict harms on those who genuinely give autonomous consent or, to\nput it another way, the extent to which autonomous people can waive\ntheir rights of bodily integrity. But policy considerations are also\nrelevant. Can one be sure that consent is genuine? Would some people\nbe forced into consenting in a way that a screening process would fail\nto detect? If so, how much weight should be attached to cases where\norgans are taken without genuine consent? These questions arise for\nliving donation in general, but the errors are worse in cases where\nsevere harm or death is the certain consequence of donation. (The\nquestions also arise in the debates about whether voluntary slavery or\neuthanasia should be permitted (Feinberg 1986)).\n",
