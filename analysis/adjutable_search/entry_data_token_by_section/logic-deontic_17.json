A specific, paradigmatic case is the one where we have two\nobligations that are logically incompatible, such as:\n\n(1)\nIt is obligatory that I now meet Jones (say, as promised to Jones,\nmy friend).\n(2)\nIt is obligatory that I now do not meet Jones (say, as promised to\nSmith, another\n friend).[91]\n\n\nHere it would seem that I have a conflict of obligations, in fact a\nquite direct and explicit one, since what I promised one person would\nhappen, I promised another would not happen. People do (e.g., under\npressure or distraction) make conflicting promises (cf. conflicting\nappointments), and it appears that they incur conflicting obligations\nas a\n result.[92]\n But consider the natural representation of these in SDLs:\n\n\\[\\tag{\\(1'\\)} \\OB j\\] \\[\\tag{\\(2'\\)} \\OB \\neg j\\]\n\n\nThese premises are inconsistent in SDL. First, they are simply\nexcluded by NC \\((\\OB p \\rightarrow \\neg \\OB \\neg\n p)\\).[93]\n But merely giving up NC is not sufficient. In fact, any normal modal\nlogic (hence, any logic that contains K and Necessitation, or\nequivalently, \\(\\OB\\)-RM, \\(\\OB\\)-C, and RE based on PC) will generate\ndeontic explosion:\n\n(DEX)\nFor every \\(p, q: \\OB p, \\OB \\neg p \\vdash \\OB q\\).\n\n\nIn effect this means that once one has conflicting obligations,\neverything is obligatory. Apart from this trivializing aspect, the\nvalidity of \\(\\OB\\)-RM and \\(\\OB\\)-C also means that having two\nincompatible obligations implausibly reduces to having a single\nself-contradictory obligation, cf.\n supplement G, Collapse of conflicts into impossible obligations.\n\nAs for \\(\\OB\\)-N and \\(\\OB\\)-RM, this problem can be tackled in\nvarious ways. Let us start with those who develop conflict-tolerant\ndeontic logics, by giving up one or more of the aforementioned\nprinciples. This gives rise to three distinct classes of such\nlogics:\n\nNon-aggregative deontic logics, which invalidate\n\\(\\OB\\)-C (aka the Aggregation rule for OB). Here, the classical\nexample is the logic \\(\\bP\\) (see, e.g., Goble 2003), which is\ncharacterized by various semantics that weaken specific features of\nSDL\u2019s possible worlds-semantics.\nInheritance-free deontic logics, or logics that only\nsatisfy a weakened form of \\(\\OB\\)-RM. Here, Goble\u2019s DPM-systems\n(Goble 2005) are particularly well-studied.\nParaconsistent (and possibly relevant) deontic logics,\nwhich refute the Ex Falso Quodlibet principle that underlies\ndeontic explosion. These logics preserve the full \u201cmodal\npart\u201d of SDL, at the cost of giving up on classicality for\nnegation. Semantically, they require non-classical (or so-called\n\u201cimpossible\u201d) worlds in which, e.g., both \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg\np\\) can be true.\n\n\nHowever, giving up on any of these three principles may be too\ndrastic. Suppose, e.g., that, apart from the obligations (1) and (2)\nmentioned above, I also face the obligation to visit Tom (\\(t\\)), and\nin case I visit Tom, to hand him over a letter from Jane (\\(l\\)). So\nwe have as premises \\(\\OB j\\), \\(\\OB \\neg j\\), \\(\\OB t\\), \\(\\OB (t\n\\rightarrow l)\\). Suppose moreover that \\(t\\) and \\(l\\) are perfectly\ncompatible with either of \\(j\\) or \\(\\neg j\\). Then any of the three\nabove-mentioned strategies would still invalidate the inference to\n\\(\\OB l\\): we can no longer infer that I ought to hand over the\nletter.\n\nMore recently, it has been argued that by using a non-monotonic\nframework such as adaptive logics, one can accommodate deontic\nconflicts and yet retain most of the inferential power of SDL. The\nrough idea behind this account is that one only rejects certain\nprinciples of SDL when they concern obligations that are in fact\nconflicted (in view of the premises). See Goble 2013 and Van de Putte,\nBeirlaen, and Meheus forthcoming for an overview of such adaptive\ndeontic logics.\n\nAnother shortcoming of most existing conflict-tolerant deontic logics\nis that they only focus on the above-mentioned paradigmatic case of\nbinary conflicts between logically contradictory obligations. In\ncontrast, conflicts often arise between obligations that are just\nincompatible in view of the circumstances one finds oneself in, and\nhence have a contingent\n basis.[94]\n In principle, SDL would be perfectly fine with such\n\u201ccontingent\u201d conflicts, and we could express them in an\nenriched language by formulas of the type \n\n\\[\\tag{DC} \\OB p \\amp \\OB q \\amp \\neg \\Diamond(p \\amp q)\\]\n\n\nHowever, (DC) in combination with (\\(\\OB\\)-C) yields triviality as\nsoon as we endorse a minimalistic version of Kant\u2019s law that\nought implies can: \n\n\\[\\tag{OiC} \\OB p \\rightarrow \\Diamond p\\]\n\n\nSimilar problems arise if we try to formalize contingent deontic\nconflicts following the Andersonian-Kangerian reduction, as shown in\n supplement H, A puzzle surrounding Kant\u2019s law.\n\nLet us note that a long-ignored and challenging further puzzle for\nconflicting obligations, sometimes called \u201cvan Fraassen\u2019s\nPuzzle\u201d and inspired by van Fraassen 1973 has deservedly\nreceived increased attention: Horty 1994, 2003; van der Torre and Tan\n2000; McNamara 2004a; Hansen 2004; and Goble 2005. For a brief general\noverview, see Section 8.4 of Hilpinen and McNamara 2013.\n\nAn altogether different approach towards conflicting obligations\nconsists in distinguishing between prima facie (or pro\ntanto) obligations, and all-things considered (pro toto)\nobligations, and insisting that SDL and its siblings are logics of the\nlatter notion. This distinction has been famous at least since (Ross\n1939). It can be illustrated by Plato\u2019s Dilemma (Lemmon\n 1962a):[95]\n\nI\u2019m obligated to meet you now for a light lunch meeting at\nthe restaurant.\nI\u2019m obligated to rush my choking child to the hospital.\n\n\nHere we seem to have an indirect non-explicit conflict of obligations,\nif we assume that satisfying both obligations is practically\nimpossible. Yet, unlike in our prior example, where the two promises\nmight naturally have been on a par, we would all agree that the\nobligation to help my child overrides my obligation to meet\nyou for lunch. In other words, the first obligation is\ndefeated by the second obligation, which takes\nprecedence. Ordinarily, we would also assume that no other\nobligation overrides my obligation to rush my child to the hospital,\nso that this obligation is an all things considered non-overridden\nobligation, but not so for the obligation to meet you for lunch.\nFurthermore, we are also prone to say that the situation is one where\nthe general obligation we have to keep our appointments (or to keep\nour promises, still more generally) has an\nexception\u2014the circumstances are extenuating.\n\nIf we define an \u201cobligations dilemma\u201d as a conflict of\nobligations where neither of the conflicting obligations is overridden\n(cf. Sinnott-Armstrong 1988), then the case above involves a conflict\nof obligations but not an obligations dilemma. Once we acknowledge\nconflicts of obligation, there is the further issue of representing\nthe logic of reasoning about conflicting obligations where some do or\ndon\u2019t override others, some are or are not defeated, some are,\nsome are not all things considered non-overridden obligations, where\nobligation dilemmas do or don\u2019t exist, where some obligations\nhold generally, but not unexceptionally, some are absolute, etc. So a\ncentral issue here is that of conflicting obligations of different\nweight and the defeasibility of obligations. Clearly,\nthere is no mechanism in SDL for this, since SDL does not allow for\nconflicts to begin with, yet this is an issue that goes well beyond\nthat of merely having a logic that allows for conflicts. There have\nbeen a variety of approaches to this dilemma, and to defeasibility\namong conflicting\n obligations.[96]\n",
