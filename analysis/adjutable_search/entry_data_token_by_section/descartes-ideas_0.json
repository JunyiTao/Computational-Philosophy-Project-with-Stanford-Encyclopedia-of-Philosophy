    "main_text": "Ideas Understood as Modes of Thinking\n1. Ideas Understood as Modes of Thinking\n\nAccording to Descartes\u2019 ontology there are substances,\nattributes, and modes. These are understood relative\nto one another, in terms of ontological dependence. Modes depend on\nattributes, and attributes depend on substances. The dependence\nrelation is transitive; thus, modes depend ultimately on substances.\nNo substances, no modes. In Principles, Part I, Article 53,\nDescartes says that a mode \u201cpresupposes\u201d an attribute (AT\nVIIIA 25; CSM I 210), and in Article 52 he says that an attribute\n\u201cpresupposes\u201d an existing substance. A mode of\nsome thing was understood by Descartes as a a way of being\nthat thing. So, where X is some substance, a mode M\nis a way of being X. That said, in Article 52 he also says\nthat a substance minus its attributes cannot be known to the human\nmind. Attributes are in fact what make existing substances\nintelligible to the human mind. He reaffirms this in Article 62, where\nhe says that there is only a distinction in reason between an\nattribute and an existing substance. (AT VIIIA 30; CSM I 214) This\nstrongly suggests that although one may draw a conceptual distinction\nbetween an attribute and existing substance, the two are not distinct\nin reality. They are really one and the same thing. (Nolan 1997,\nHoffman 2002) Subsequently, if mode M is a way of being\nX, where X is the substance, the intelligibility of\nX requires that we conceive some attribute A. And\nso, strictly speaking, mode M is understood as a mode of\nattribute A, where A is the attribute through which\nthe existing substance X is conceived (where in reality\nA and X are presumably identical).\n\nThe nature of a mind, Descartes says, is to think. If a thing does not\nthink, it is not a mind. In terms of his ontology, the mind is an\nexisting (finite) substance, and thought or thinking is its attribute.\nInsofar as the nature of a mind is to think, where thought is the\nmind\u2019s defining feature, Descartes calls it the mind\u2019s\nprincipal attribute (AT VIIIA 25; CSM I 210\u201311). An\nidea is a mode of thinking. In being a mode of thinking, an\nidea is understood as a way of being (an instance of) thinking, or an\nidea is way in which an instance of thinking is manifested. This is\nsimilar to what Descartes says about a body, its principal attribute,\nand its modes. The nature of a body is to be extended (in length,\nbreadth, and depth). A body is a (finite) substance, and extension is\nits attribute. Since extension is the defining feature of a body,\nDescartes refers to it as a body\u2019s principal attribute. Shape is\na mode of extension. What this means is that shape is a way of being\nextended, or a way in which an instance of extension is manifested.\nThus, shape is to extension as idea is to thought. Thus a shape\npresupposes extension and an idea presupposes thinking, where each\nprincipal attribute presupposes an existing substance.\n\nInsofar as ideas are modes, they occupy the lowest rung on\nDescartes\u2019 ontological ladder. This can be contrasted to\nPlato\u2019s theory, for example, which casts ideas as substances,\noccupying the upper-most rung of the ontological ladder. So, whereas\nfor Plato ideas are the most real things in the cosmos, for Descartes\nideas are among the least real. Another departure from Plato\u2019s\nview was Descartes\u2019 taking ideas as the vehicles of\nrepresentation, as the items doing the representing. By contrast,\nPlato took ideas to be the things represented. Socrates, for instance,\nwas taken by Plato to be a representation of the form or idea of man.\nThese differences are certainly enough to suggest that ideas are\nplaying significantly different roles in their respective systems. So,\nit would not be reasonable to think that Descartes\u2019 view was\nsimply an extension of Plato\u2019s, despite the fact that Descartes\nhad adopted some of Plato\u2019s terminology.\n\nIdeas are not the only modes of thinking. Doubting and judging, for\nexample, are also modes of thinking. Early in the Third Meditation,\nDescartes works out a basic division of the various modes of thinking.\nHe sorts them into two kinds: simple and complex. Ideas are included\nin the category of simple modes. Doubting, judging, and the like, are\nincluded in the category of complex modes. Even so, all complex modes\ninclude ideas as constituents. A complex mode of thought includes at\nleast two basic mental components: an idea and some\n\u201cadditional\u201d mental feature. He writes:\n\n\u2026[C]onsiderations of order appear to dictate that I now\nclassify my thoughts into definite kinds, and ask which of them can\nproperly be said to be the bearers of truth and falsity. Some of my\nthoughts are as it were the images of things, and it is only in these\ncases that the term \u201cidea\u201d is strictly appropriate \u2014\nfor example, when I think of a man, or a chimera, or the sky, or an\nangel, or God. Other thoughts have various additional forms: thus when\nI will, or am afraid, or affirm, or deny, there is always a particular\nthing which I take as the object of my thought, but my thought\nincludes something more than the likeness of that thing. Some thoughts\nin this category are called volitions or emotions, while others are\ncalled judgements. (AT VII 36\u20137; CSM II 25\u20136)\n\n\nIn this passage, ideas are cast as modes of thinking that represent\n(or present or exhibit) objects to the mind\u2014objects such as a\nman, or Pegasus, or the sky, or an angel, or God (and given what\nDescartes says in the First Meditation, among the list of things\nexhibited to the mind by way of its ideas, one could add colors,\nsounds, feels, and so on (AT VII 20; CSM II 13\u201314)). On\nDescartes\u2019 view, an idea is the only kind of (simple)\nmode that does this. When considering one of the more complex modes of\nthought\u2014for instance, fearing a lion or affirming the\nPythagorean Theorem, where the lion and the theorem are the objects\npresented\u2014it is the idea that is doing the presenting; it is the\nvehicle of representation. As Descartes will note in the Fourth\nMeditation, he takes there to be two basic faculties (capacities or\nabilities) of the mind: the intellect (or\nunderstanding) and the will. Ideas are\n\u201cproduced\u201d by the intellect. So, the idea of the\nPythagorean Theorem has its origin in the faculty of the intellect or\nunderstanding. The act of affirming, the other component of the more\ncomplex thought of affirming this theorem, has its origin in the\nfaculty of the will. Contributions from both faculties, then, give\nrise to the more complex kinds of thought.\n\nDescartes is careful to not identify ideas as pictures or as\nvisual images, but instead says that they are as it\nwere [tanquam] images of things. This is a long-standing\ntheme, for we find it expressed as early as The World (AT XI\n3\u20136; CSM I 81\u20132) and the Optics (AT VI\n112\u201313; CSM I 165), and as late as the Principles (AT\nVIIIA 32\u20133; CSM I 216\u201317) and Description of the Human\nBody (AT XI 255\u2013257; CSM I 322\u201323), where in these\ncontexts ideas are cast as representing their objects without\nnecessarily resembling them. This is important to the theory, since\nthe idea of cold or the idea of sweet, for example, insofar as they\nare ideas, represent something to the mind, but they are not\nvisual images. The point holds for other ideas, such as the\nidea of God, which Descartes explicitly lists in the above passage.\nThe idea of God represents something to the mind (it represents an\ninfinite substance), and in line with traditional theological\ndoctrine, supposing that God is non-spatial and non-temporal, the idea\ncannot be understood as being a visual image of God.\n\nConsistent with what he says in the above Third Meditation passage,\nDescartes says in other places that an idea is \u201cthe form of any\ngiven thought, immediate perception of which makes me aware of the\nthought\u201d (AT VII 160; CSM II 113). In his reply to Thomas Hobbes\n(1588\u20131679), author of the Third Set of Objections, Descartes\nsays that an idea is \u201cwhatever is immediately perceived by the\nmind\u201d (AT VII 181; CSM II 127). In his reply to Pierre Gassendi\n(1592\u20131655), author of the Fifth Set of Objections, he says that\nthe term \u201cidea\u201d is extended \u201cto cover any object of\nthought\u201d (AT VII 366; CSM II 253). In a letter to Marin Mersenne\n(1588\u20131648), dated July 1641, he says that \u201cidea\u201d\ndenotes \u201cin general everything which is in our mind when we\nconceive something, no matter how we conceive it\u201d (AT III 393;\nCSMK III 185). Long-standing interpretations take such passages as\ntelling us that ideas have the special feature of\nintentionality\u2014they are directed at their respective\nobjects. It is in terms of this directedness that the mind is said to\nbe aware of an object.\n\nOne long-standing interpretation, the Representationalist\ninterpretation, says that for Descartes the objects immediately\npresented to the mind (by way of an idea) are purely mental\nobjects. This interpretation emphasizes Descartes\u2019 saying that\nsuch objects are solely in the intellect, as when he says to\nCaterus that the object of which the mind is immediately or directly\naware when having the idea of the Sun \u201c\u2026is not an actual\nentity, that is, it is not a being located outside the\nintellect\u2026\u201d (AT VII 103; CSM II 75) The object at which\nthe mind is directed, the immediate object of awareness, is\nnot the Sun itself, but is instead a purely mental object, which\nrepresents (or stands for) the Sun in the heavens. This purely mental\nobject is said to constitute the content of the idea. On this\nview, an idea is sometimes referred to as a tertium quid, a\nthird thing, which \u201cstands between\u201d the mind\u2019s eye,\nso to speak, and the object that the idea represents.\n\nAnother long-standing interpretation, the Direct Realist\ninterpretation, says that for Descartes the objects immediately\nrepresented or presented to the mind (by way of an idea) are not\nalways mental objects. (Nadler 1989) The idea of the Sun is understood\nas being a mental operation (a mode of the mind) directed at the Sun\nitself. In fact, on this interpretation, all ideas are, properly\nspeaking, to be understood as operations or acts of the mind. This\nholds even for the idea of Pegasus. The idea is a mental operation and\nin this case is directed at the mentally fabricated object, Pegasus.\nHere, Pegasus is a purely mental object. By contrast, the (sensory)\nidea of the Sun is directed at the Sun itself, the Sun in the heavens.\nThus, this interpretation allows ideas to be directed at mental and\nextra-mental objects. The import of this interpretation is that the\nimmediate objects of awareness need not be purely\nmental\u2014so, no tertium quid\u2014which differs\ndramatically from the Representationalist interpretation. Although\nboth readings have their merits, the remainder of this entry will work\nwithin the framework of the Representationalist reading.\n",
