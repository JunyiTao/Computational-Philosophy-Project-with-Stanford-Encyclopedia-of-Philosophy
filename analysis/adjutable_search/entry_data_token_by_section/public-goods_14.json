    "main_text": "The Ethics of Public Goods: Should the Government Pay for Public Goods? || Controversial Assumptions in Welfare Economics\n6.1 Controversial Assumptions in Welfare Economics\n\nHowever, to reach the conclusion that the government should provide\npublic goods, one requires a number of additional assumptions, all of\nwhich are controversial. Standard welfare economics identifies\nwell-being with preference satisfaction, a view that has received much\ncriticism (see entry on\n well being;\n Nussbaum 2001; Hausman et al. 2017: Ch. 8; Reiss 2013: Ch. 12). It is\nimplausible to assume that people always choose what is best for them.\nPeople may have inconsistent or unstable preferences such as the\nsmoker who flushes his cigarettes down the toilet in an attempt to\nquit smoking, just in order to buy a new pack the next day. If people\nhave inconsistent or unstable preferences, it is unclear which\nconsistent set to choose for policy. Uninformed preferences also\nappear to be a bad basis for policy. If people erroneously believe,\nsay, that there is no external threat, they might prefer less\ninvestment in national defence than if they were fully informed. It\nhas been argued that in the political realm, insufficient knowledge is\nthe norm rather than the exception (Somin 1998, Caplan 2007, Somin\n2013). It might be extraordinarily difficult to assess the value of a\npublic good to an individual, especially if the public good is a\nnational or global one such as defence, climate change mitigation or\nbasic research.\n\nIt has therefore been argued that rational or laundered or informed\npreferences should provide the basis for policy decisions (e.g.,\nThaler & Sunstein 2008, Anomaly 2015). But it is not clear that we\ncan straightforwardly assess what citizens would prefer if they were\nfully rational and informed. There is always the danger that whoever\nmakes that assessment substitutes his or her preferences for the\ncitizens\u2019 or that his or her preferences influence the judgement\nabout what the citizens\u2019 preferences might be (Rizzo &\nWhitman 2008, 2009).\n\nAssessing the value of a public good in terms of preference\nsatisfaction, actual or rational, involves another problem: the\nimpossibility of interpersonal comparisons. Suppose there are two\nindivisible public goods A and B, Bob prefers A\nwhile Sally prefers B, and Bob and Sally\u2019s combined\nwealth suffices to buy only either A or B. Under a\npreference-satisfaction account of welfare, there arguably is no\nnormatively defensible way to compare Bob\u2019s welfare\nwhen A is purchased to Sally\u2019s welfare when B is\npurchased or to compare what Bob would gain by purchasing and what\nSally would gain by purchasing B. Dan Hausman has argued that\nthis problem constitutes a reason to abandon the\npreference-satisfaction account of welfare because any moral theory\nthat assesses situations fully or in part in terms of welfare requires\ninterpersonal comparisons (Hausman 1995).\n\nStandard welfare economics does not make interpersonal comparisons\nbecause it asks whether policies constitute a Pareto improvement over\nthe status quo. A policy constitutes a Pareto improvement if and only\nif it makes some people better off while making no-one worse off. But\nfew policies are as unequivocal as this standard demands. Especially\nwhen it comes to the items that are usually discussed under the rubric\nof public goods, it is rarely if ever the case that no-one is made\nworse off by the provision.\n\nAn alternative that has been introduced in the late 1930s is\nHicks-Kaldor improvement (after Hicks 1939 and Kaldor 1939). If there\nare winners and losers to a policy, it constitutes a Hicks-Kaldor\nimprovement whenever losers can be compensated by winners\u2019\ngains. But that losers can be compensated is little\nconsolation unless they actually are compensated, and there is no\nreason to believe that this always happens (see for instance Rodrik\n2017 on the failures to compensate losers from free-trade\narrangements).\n\nCharacterising the public goods problem as a simple Prisoners\u2019\nDilemma is therefore a significant idealisation. Frequently, the\nproduction of a public good will benefit some but make others worse\noff. Generally speaking, the decision whether to provide a public good\nor not involves issues of fairness, equality and justice.\n\nWelfare economists tend to ignore such issues because neither Pareto\nimprovements nor Kaldor-Hicks improvements (in their usual\ninterpretations) need information about anything other than\npreferences. Indeed, standard welfare economics assumes that\nwell-being is all that matters to the evaluation of social outcomes.\nMost people, however, care also about other values (Sen 1999: Ch. 3;\nHausman et al. 2017: Chs 9\u201312; Reiss 2013: Ch. 14).\n\nOne moral issue that has to be addressed even when the item in\nquestion is unequivocally a public good to everyone affected by its\nprovision is that of paternalism (see entry on\n paternalism).\n It is by no means obvious that a coercive government intervention,\neven one that makes everyone better off is justified. Austrian-School\neconomist Hans-Herrmann Hoppe expresses scepticism about the\npermissibility of such interventions when he writes:\n\n\nThe norm required to reach the above conclusion is this: Whenever one\ncan somehow prove that the production of a particular good or service\nhas a positive effect on someone else but would not be produced at all\nor would not be produced in a definite quantity or quality unless\ncertain people participated in its financing, then the use of\naggressive violence against these persons is allowed, either directly\nor indirectly with the help of the state, and these persons may be\nforced to share in the necessary financial burden. (Hoppe 1989:\n31)\n\n\nInfringements on rights are not the only worry we might have. Some\npublic goods might disproportionately benefit those who are already\nrelatively well-off and therefore exacerbate existing inequalities.\nSome aspects of tertiary education, for instance, might well be public\ngoods but if tertiary education was mainly to the benefit of\nrelatively well-off individuals, government provision could be\nconsidered unfair. It is therefore not clear whether the government\nprovision of a public good is morally good, all things considered.\n",
