In this\nsection we shall consider two other facets of dualism that worry\ncritics. First, there is what one might term the queerness of\nthe mental if conceived of as non-physical. Second there is the\ndifficulty of giving an account of the unity of the mind. We shall\nconsider this latter as it faces both the bundle theorist and the\nsubstance dualist.\n",
