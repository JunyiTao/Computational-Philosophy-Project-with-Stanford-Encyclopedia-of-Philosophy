    "main_text": "What is Structural Rationality? || Instances of Structural (Ir)rationality: An Inventory\n1.4 Instances of Structural (Ir)rationality: An Inventory\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve focused mostly on inconsistent beliefs and\nmeans-end incoherence as paradigm instances of structural\nirrationality. But there are many other putative instances. Any\nparticular instance will be controversial, since it is always up for\ndebate whether some combination of mental states really is\nstructurally irrational. And it is not feasible to be completely\ncomprehensive in identifying all the candidate instances. But we will\ndraw attention to some of the (patterns of) combinations of states\nthat are among the most plausible candidates.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with some combinations of doxastic states that are\nplausibly structurally irrational. Along with strictly contradictory\nbeliefs \u2013 i.e., a belief in \\(p\\) and a belief in not-\\(p\\)\n\u2013 it is often thought that other logically inconsistent sets of\nbeliefs are structurally irrational. For example, as mentioned\nearlier, it seems structurally irrational for Ali to believe he is\nSuperman, believe that Superman can fly, and yet believe that he\ncannot fly. More strongly, some have thought that it is structurally\nirrational to fail to believe the logical entailments of one\u2019s\nbeliefs \u2013 so that Ali would be irrational were he to believe\nthat he is Superman, believe that Superman can fly, and merely\nfail to believe that he himself can fly. The requirement that\none believes the logical entailments of one\u2019s beliefs is often\ncalled \u2018deductive closure\u2019.\n\nHowever, there are thorny issues about whether all instances\nof inconsistency, or of failing to believe the logical entailments of\none\u2019s beliefs, involve irrationality. First, it is not clear if\nthis is so when the relevant inconsistency or entailment is extremely\nsubtle and would take a complex logical proof to detect (Broome 2013:\n154\u20135). Second, it is not clear that we are irrational for\nfailing to clutter our minds with the infinite trivial consequences of\nour existing beliefs (Harman 1986: 12). In response to the first\nproblem, some say that structural irrationality obtains only when one\nrecognizes the relevant inconsistency or entailment\n(Sainsbury 2002). In response to the second, some say that, where\n\\(q\\) is some consequence of one\u2019s existing beliefs, one needs\nto care about whether \\(q\\) (Broome 2013) or attend to \\(q\\) to be\nstructurally irrational for failing to believe \\(q\\). However, these\nrestrictions do not deal with all purported cases of rational\ninconsistency. For example, the preface paradox (Makinson 1965) is a\nplausible case of rational but inconsistent beliefs (see esp.\nChristensen 2004). In this case, an author writes a book containing a\nnumber of claims, but modestly affirms in the preface that doubtless,\nthe book contains errors \u2013 i.e., that at least one of the claims\nin the book is false. This total set of beliefs \u2013 the claims in\nthe book, plus the preface claim \u2013 is inconsistent, but\narguably, it is not irrational to hold these beliefs \u2013 even if\none recognizes the inconsistency, and attends to and cares about the\nrelevant beliefs. While some (MacFarlane 2004 \u2013 see Other\nInternet Resources) hold that this is a case where substantive and\nstructural rationality conflict, others (Worsnip 2016a) have argued\nthat the inconsistent beliefs in these cases are not even\nstructurally irrational.\n\nIt is also widely held that agents can be structurally irrational in\nvirtue of the ways that their first-order beliefs combine with their\nhigher-order beliefs: that is, with beliefs about the normative status\nof their first-order beliefs, or about their evidence for them. For\nexample, it\u2019s often thought to be structurally irrational to\nbelieve \\(p\\) while also believing that one\u2019s evidence does not\nadequately support \\(p\\) \u2013 or to fail to believe \\(p\\) while\nalso believing that one\u2019s evidence decisively supports \\(p\\)\n(see, among many others, Kolodny 2005; Feldman 2005; Titelbaum 2015).\nSuch combinations of states are sometimes described as\n\u201cepistemically akratic\u201d (Horowitz 2014; Greco 2014). While\nsome deny that such states must be irrational on the grounds that they\ncan be rational in cases of misleading higher-order evidence (Coates\n2012; Lasonen-Aarnio 2020), others think that it is at most\nsubstantively rational, but not structurally rational, to be\nepistemically akratic in such cases (Worsnip 2018a).\n\nMany of the kinds of irrationality pinpointed by formal\nepistemologists, which typically pertain to credences rather than to\nfull belief, can also be plausibly regarded as structural. For\nexample, (most) failures to conform one\u2019s credences to the\naxioms of probability \u2013 such as the aforementioned case of\nassigning credence 0.6 to \\(p\\) and credence 0.41 to\nnot-\\(p\\) \u2013 are plausibly structurally irrational.\nSomewhat more controversially, failing to update one\u2019s credences\nvia conditionalization might be viewed as a kind of structural\nirrationality between one\u2019s prior and posterior credences. The\nlatter case is more controversial, because this kind of\n\u201cincoherence\u201d is typically understood as diachronic,\nwhereas some think that structural irrationality is a synchronic\nphenomenon (see \u00a72.3). Consequently, viewing it as a kind of\nincoherence either requires us to pinpoint some kind of synchronic\nfailure that occurs when one fails to conditionalize properly, or to\nallow for diachronic instances of structural irrationality.\n\nLet\u2019s now turn to forms of structural irrationality that (at\nleast partly) involve non-doxastic states. One paradigmatic example of\nstructural irrationality that we\u2019ve already mentioned is\nmeans-end incoherence (also known as \u2018instrumental\nirrationality\u2019, though this term is sometimes used with other\nmeanings; see also the entry on\n instrumental rationality),\n whereby one intends to \\(\\Phi\\), believes that in order to \\(\\Phi\\)\none must \\(\\Psi\\), but does not intend to \\(\\Psi\\). Besides this,\nperhaps the most common example of structural irrationality involving\nnon-doxastic states is practical akrasia \u2013 believing one ought,\nall things considered, to \\(\\Phi\\) but not intending to \\(\\Phi\\) (see,\namong many others, Broome 2001b, 2013; Kolodny 2005; for dissent, see\nArpaly 2000). Notably, this form of structural irrationality (as well\nas means-end incoherence) involves incoherence between a belief and an\nintention (or lack of), thus bridging doxastic and conative states.\nAnother example of a form of incoherence that bridges doxastic and\nconative states might be intending to do something that one believes\none cannot do.\n\nThere are also plausible examples of structural irrationality that\nobtain solely between conative states. It\u2019s often held that it\nis structurally irrational to have contradictory intentions \u2013\nthat is, to intend to \\(\\Phi\\) and intend not to \\(\\Phi\\). And as in\nthe doxastic case, there are forms of incoherence studied by\nformally-inclined philosophers (and economists) that are naturally\nthought of as instances of structural irrationality \u2013 such as\nhaving cyclical preferences, whereby one prefers \\(A\\) to \\(B\\),\nprefers \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), and yet prefers \\(C\\) to \\(A\\) (Davidson,\nMcKinsey and Suppes 1955; Gaus 2008: 36\u201340).\n\nFinally \u2013 though this is understudied \u2013 there may be forms\nof structural irrationality that involve affective and emotional\nstates (see also the entry on\n emotion,\n section 10). For example, perhaps it is structurally irrational to\nhope for something that one believes to be bad, or to fear something\nthat one believes to be good. And perhaps it is also irrational to\nhope for or fear something that one believes to be\nimpossible.\n",
