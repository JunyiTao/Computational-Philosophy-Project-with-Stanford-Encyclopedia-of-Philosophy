    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Church\u2019s Modest Realism\n6.2 Church\u2019s Modest Realism\n\nChurch was at pains to distinguish his preferred brand of realism from\nPlatonism (1973a [BE: 748]). Moreover, he was also clear that his\nrealism was not\n\n\neven the extreme realism of Frege and G\u00f6del, but rather only in\nopposition to the claim of superior reality for physical or\nspatio-temporal entities. (1951b, fn. Added 1971 [BE: 287])\n\n\nTo show the contrast with Frege, Church stated that while his own view\nis that the two truth values are \u201cpostulated\u201d:\n\n\nTo Frege, as a thoroughgoing Platonic realist, our use of the word\n\u201cpostulate\u201d here would not be acceptable. (1956a:\n\u00a74)\n\n\nFrege\u2019s position, according to Church, is that \u201cthere\nare two such things as truth and falsehood\u201d (1956a:\n\u00a74). Of course, it also follows from Church\u2019s semantic\ntheory together with his criterion of ontological commitment that\nthere are two such things as truth and falsehood. What, then,\nis the disagreement with Frege? It appears to be that because Church\npostulated the two truth values relative to a logistic theory, and\nbecause he did not claim to have demonstrated conclusively the truth\nof one such theory, he still saw room for consideration of competing\nlogistic theories, and so competing ontologies, which do not postulate\ntruth values as objects (cf. 1966).\n\nNevertheless, according to Church, theories that are effectively\nspecifiable (cf. 2.3) can be communicated, inspected, compared with\neach other and with observational data\u2014as well as evaluated for\ntruth by other rational, checkable procedures. So there is no\nprincipled reason (other than Church\u2019s Theorem) why,\nafter rational debate has come to an end, we could not assert the\ntruth of our theory and postulate the existence of its ontological\ncommitments with near certainty. (Of course, in some cases the theory\nmay be underdetermined by the data; and in the case of set theory\nthere may be genuine theory relativity; cf.\n \u00a75.4.)\n\nReturning to Church\u2019s \u201copposition to the claim of superior\nreality for physical or spatio-temporal entities\u201d, his reason\nwas that spatio-temporal entities are, like abstract entities,\npostulated ontological commitments of theories. For this reason,\nterminology for spatio-temporal entities does not\n\u201cbelong to the vocabulary in which the observational data are\nstated;\u201d rather they are theoretical constructs the terminology\nfor which \u201cbelongs to a theoretical language\u201d (1951b, fn.\nAdded 1971 [BE: 287]; cf. 1975 [BE: 983\u20134].)\n\nComplementary to Church\u2019s \u201copposition to the claim of\nsuperior reality for spatio-temporal entities\u201d was his view that\nabstract entities\u2014assuming they exist\u2014are no more remote\nfrom causal explanations than are spatio-temporal ones. To Carnap, who\nclaimed that abstracts entities may be avoided in causal explanations\nof phenomena (1963), Church responded by claiming\n\n\nthe cause of an event is never a physical object or even another event\nbut a total situation, in the description of which many entities, both\nabstract and concrete, must in general be mentioned (1951b, fn. Added\n1971 [BE: 287]).\n\n\nMoreover, Church added that if we assume that the objects of\nlinguistic understanding and (other) propositional attitudes are\npropositions (cf.\n \u00a73.3\n and\n \u00a76.3),\n then propositions are also an essential part of any adequate causal\nexplanation of behavior.\n\nGiven all this, it is not surprising that Church did not see a\nspecial problem about our epistemological access to concepts\nand propositions:\n\n\nBut the preference of (say) seeing over understanding as a method of\nobservation seems to me capricious. For just as an opaque body may be\nseen, so a concept may be understood or grasped. And the parallel\nbetween the two cases is indeed rather close. In both cases the\nobservation is not direct but through intermediaries\u2014light, lens\nof eye or optical instrument, and retina in the case of visible body,\nlinguistic expressions in the case of the concept. And in both cases\nthere are or may be tenable theories according to which the entity in\nquestion, opaque body or concept, is not assumed, but only those\nthings which would otherwise be called its effects. (1951b [BE:\n287])\n\n\nIt should be emphasized that Church\u2019s realism about propositions\nis not supposed to follow from their role in causal explanations but\nfrom his view that no logistic theory that is both true and humanly\nunderstandable can do without them. It is to this that we now\nturn.\n",
