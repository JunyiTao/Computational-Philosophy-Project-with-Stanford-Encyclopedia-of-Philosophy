    "main_text": "The measurement problem revisited: completeness and hidden variables\n11. The measurement problem revisited: completeness and hidden variables\n\nThe measurement problem is usually given the form of the\nincompatibility of three assertions of the following form (cf. Maudlin\n1995, Myrvold 2018):\n\nThe quantum state is \u201ccomplete\u201d.\nThe quantum state always evolves in accordance with a linear\ndynamical equation (e.g., the Schr\u00f6dinger equation).\nSuccessful measurements have unique and determinate outcomes.\n\n\nTo avoid inconsistency three interpretive strategies are standardly\nconsidered: denying completeness (a), which is often taken to lead to\nhidden-variable theories; denying (b), which results in theories\naccording to which collapses take place; or denying (c), which leads\nto many worlds.\n \nModal interpretations accept both (b) and (c), so that it follows\nthat they must violate (a). Thus, it seems clear that modal\ninterpretations have to view quantum mechanics as\n\u201cincomplete\u201d. Indeed, it is true that according to modal\ninterpretations the quantum state does not fix all actual physical\nproperties (i.e., the actual values of all definite-valued physical\nquantities) of a system, which is the criterion of incompleteness\npresupposed in (a).\n \nHowever, many proponents of modal schemes argue that the latter\nfeature is not appropriately expressed by saying that quantum\nmechanics, modally conceived, is incomplete. They object that this\nincompleteness terminology is apt to suggest a defect of the theory,\nand the need for completion (by hidden variables). But modal theorists\nmaintain that their interpretations of quantum mechanics are not in\nneed of additions, because these interpretations already contain\neverything that can reasonably be expected from theories describing a\nfundamentally probabilistic (indeterministic) world. First, modal\nschemes completely specify which observables are\ndefinite-valued. Second, they fix the possible values that may be\ntaken by these observables and they provide the probabilities with\nwhich these values may be realized. Since it is a core modal principle\nthat the actualization of properties in the quantum world is a\nfundamentally probabilistic (indeterministic) process, nothing more\nthan this probabilistic description is possible. From this viewpoint,\ninsisting that modally interpreted quantum mechanics is necessarily\nincomplete is tantamount to stipulating that any probabilistic theory\nmust be incomplete by definition\u2014even if it applies to a\nfundamentally probabilistic world. But that appears an inappropriate\nuse of terminology.\n",
