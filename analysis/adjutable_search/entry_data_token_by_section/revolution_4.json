    "main_text": "Intervention\n5. Intervention\n\nWhether intervention in revolution can be justified is a question of\ngreat significance for the morality of political revolution. We will\nuse the term \u201cintervention\u201d in a broad sense to refer to\ndeliberate military contributions made by foreign actors. Intervention\nis thus understood to include acts like contributing combatants or\nweapons, as well as acts like instituting a no-fly zone, or providing\nintelligence or logistical support or training in the use of weapons.\nGiven the asymmetrical nature of revolutionary war, military\nassistance from foreign actors may be crucial, perhaps even necessary,\nto the success of revolutionaries.\n\nThough intervention may be of urgent importance for the success of a\nrevolution, the justification of military intervention by foreign\nactors is subject to important moral limitations. Michael Walzer has\nfamously argued that the right of collective self-determination sets\nstringent constraints on what foreign actors may do. On Walzer\u2019s\nview, foreign actors can only initiate unrequested intervention when a\npeople faces a supreme humanitarian emergency, such as genocide\n(Walzer 1977; Walzer 1980). Walzer\u2019s argument results in an\nasymmetry between the justification of revolution and the\njustification of intervention; whereas the former can be justified in\nresponse to oppression that does not reach the threshold of supreme\nhumanitarian emergency, the latter cannot (for discussion of the\nasymmetry position, see Dobos 2011).\n\nBuchanan has argued that respect for self-determination entails quite\ndifferent conclusions (Buchanan 2013). Buchanan rejects two common\nprinciples offered as constraints on intervention based in respect for\nself-determination. The first is Mill\u2019s principle, which holds\nthat popular support for revolution is necessary for intervention to\nbe justified. The second is the consent principle, according to which\nthe beneficiaries of intervention must consent to the intervention for\nit to be justified. Buchanan rejects both these principles because a\npopulace that is oppressed by a Resolute Severe Tyranny faces\nconsiderable obstacles to expression of popular support for revolution\nand consent to intervention.\n\nWithout such constraints on intervention, Buchanan has offered two\ndistinctive kinds of grounds for intervention in revolutions. First,\nhe has argued on the basis of considerations of proportionality that\nforeign actors can justifiably intervene in revolutions that may not\nhave even been instigated rightfully when such intervention serves to\neither a) preempt wrongdoing and the escalation of violence and\ncoercion that tends to take place in revolutionary wars, or b)\nestablish the conditions under which the oppressed are able to\nmeaningfully convey their support for (or opposition to) revolution or\nconsent (or lack thereof) to intervention (Buchanan 2013). Second,\nBuchanan has argued that considerations of self-determination may in\nfact weigh in favor of the justification of intervention (Buchanan\n2016). He argues that respecting a peoples\u2019 right to\nself-determination requires taking measures to protect the conditions\nof the exercise of a group\u2019s self-determination and to promote\nthe conditions under which the group is capable of being\nself-determining. Consequently, on Buchanan\u2019s view respect for\nself-determination, considered by itself, entails a permission to\nintervene in revolutionary wars when doing so will protect or promote\nthe people\u2019s self-determination. This permission extends to\nconsiderations of future generations, such that foreign actors may\nalso intervene in the formation of post-revolutionary government if\nthe post-revolutionary regime was going to be such that the conditions\nof self-determination would not obtain for future persons. It is\nimportant to note that Buchanan\u2019s argument is directed only\nagainst the view that respect for self-determination rules out\nintervention. He does not hold that the fact that an intervention\nwould promote self-determination entails that intervention is\npermissible all things considered. There can be counter-vailing\nconsiderations.\n\nMassimo Renzo offers the following critical reply to Buchanan\u2019s\nargument (Renzo 2018). Renzo first argues that even if a person is\ntemporarily incapable of exercising a right, this does not mean that\nothers cannot violate the right. Accordingly, the fact that some group\nis unable to exercise its right to self-determination does not imply\nthat others may act as though the group had no right to\nself-determination at all. Constraints based in self-determination may\nstill obtain on the grounds of a) past exercises of\nself-determination, and b) available reasons concerning how the group\nwould exercise their right to self-determination if they were able to\ndo so (for a critical reply to Renzo, see Weltman 2019). Buchanan\nmight reply that he acknowledges that the right of self-determination\ncontinues to exist under conditions in which the right-holders are\nincapable of exercising it but the right is violated only when it\ncould be exercised, not by measures that enable its exercise. The idea\nwould be that under conditions in which a tyranny prevents the people\nfrom developing the capacity for self-determination, the right is,\nlatent or in reserve and that respecting self-determination can in\nsome circumstances mean doing what is necessary to make the exercise\nof the right possible.\n\nThe exchange reviewed so far takes for granted that self-determination\nis relevant to some extent in determining the justification of\nintervention. A number of authors, however, deny that\nself-determination is of any import at all. On such views, if jus\nad bellum principles are satisfied, then intervention is\njustified regardless of whether it is supported by beneficiaries\n(McMahan 2010; Altman and Wellman 2011: ch. 5; Teson 2017 ch. 3).\nBecause these arguments reject that respect for self-determination\nsets constraints on intervention, they consequently entail a rejection\nof Walzer\u2019s asymmetrical position, resulting in a symmetry\nbetween permissions to engage in revolutionary war and permissions for\nforeign actors to engage in military intervention.\n\nReplying to such views, Renzo has argued that self-determination is\nindeed a value that sets constraints on the justification of\nintervention (Renzo 2020). Key to Renzo\u2019s argument is the claim\nthat self-determination is an independent value. In support of this\nclaim, Renzo argues that appeal to self-determination is necessary to\nexplain the wrongness of a certain kind of colonialism. Renzo holds\nthat colonialism that does not involve the violation of the basic\nhuman rights of colonized is nevertheless wrong because it violates a\npeople\u2019s right to self-determination. Having established that\nself-determination is indeed an independent value, Renzo goes on to\nargue that respect for the value of self-determination sets a pro\ntanto constraint on the justification of intervention. This\npro tanto constraint requires taking into consideration how a\ncommunity would have exercised its right to self-determination if it\nwere able to do so, and how it has exercised its self-determination in\nthe past in order to determine whether the intervention would be\naccepted by the community. Renzo does not, however, conclude that on\nhis account there is an asymmetry between revolution and intervention.\nRather, he argues that there is a symmetry, because revolutions will\ntend to be instigated by a vanguard group that in effect bears the\nsame relationship to the people as does a foreign actor. Accordingly,\nhe argues that there is symmetry between the justification of\nintervention and the justification of revolution because both must\ntake into consideration the right to self-determination of the\npeople.\n\nAn alternative account of the relationship between revolution and\nintervention is offered by Christopher J. Finlay (Finlay 2020). Finlay\nargues that revolution and intervention are complementary. He holds\nthat intervention is a supplement for revolution, such that the\njustification of intervention is a function of the justification of\nrevolution. In order for intervention to be justified on\nFinlay\u2019s view, it must be that, first, the beneficiaries of\nintervention are unable to secure their own rights, and second, that\ndomestic leaders of a revolution would be unable to succeed on their\nown.\n",
