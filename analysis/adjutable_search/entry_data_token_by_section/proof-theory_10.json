    "main_text": "Hilbert\u2019s Program, Extended || Constructive Frameworks\n4.1 Constructive Frameworks \n\nA particularly appealing idea is to pursue Hilbert\u2019s program\nrelative to a constructive point of view and determine which parts of\nclassical mathematics are demonstrably consistent relative to that\nstandpoint (see Rathjen 2009 for pursuing this with regard to\nMartin-L\u00f6f type theory). As one would suspect, there are\ndiffering \u201cschools\u201d of constructivism and different layers\nof constructivism. Several frameworks for developing mathematics from\nsuch a point of view have been proposed. Some we will refer to in this\narticle (arguably the most important) are:\n\nArithmetical Predicativism.\nTheories of higher type functionals.\nTakeuti\u2019s \u201cHilbert-Gentzen finitist\nstandpoint\u201d.\nFeferman\u2019s explicit mathematics.\nMartin-L\u00f6f\u2019s intuitionistic type theory.\nConstructive set theory (Myhill, Friedman, Beeson, Aczel).\n\n\nAt this point we will just give a very rough description of these\nfoundational views. A few more details, especially about their scope\non a standard scale of theories and proof-theoretic ordinals, will be\nprovided at the very end of\n section 5.3.\n\n(a) Arithmetical Predicativism originated in the writings of\nPoincar\u00e9 and Russell in response to the set-theoretic\nparadoxes. It is characterized by a ban of impredicative definitions.\nWhilst it accepts the completed infinite set of naturals numbers, all\nother sets are required to be constructed out of them via an\nautonomous process of arithmetical definitions. A first systematic\nattempt at developing mathematics predicatively was made in\nWeyl\u2019s 1918 monograph Das Kontinuum (Weyl 1918).\n\n(b) Theories of higher type functionals comprise G\u00f6del\u2019s\nT and Spector\u2019s extension of T via functionals\ndefined by bar recursion. The basic idea goes back to\nG\u00f6del\u2019s 1938 lecture at Zilsel\u2019s (G\u00f6del 1995:\n94). It was inspired by Hilbert\u2019s 1926 \u00dcber das\nUnendliche, which considered a hierarchy of functionals over the\nnatural numbers, not only of finite but also of transfinite type.\n\n(c) To understand Takeuti\u2019s finitist standpoint it is important\nto pinpoint the place where in a consistency proof \u00e0 la Gentzen\nthe means of PRA are exceeded. Gentzen\u2019s proof\nemploys a concrete ordering \\(\\prec\\) of type \\(\\varepsilon_0\\), it\nuses an assignment of ordinals to proofs and provides a reduction\nprocedure on proofs such that any alleged proof of an inconsistency is\nreduced to another proof of an inconsistency which gets assigned a\nsmaller element of the ordering. The ordering, the ordinal assignment\nand the reduction procedure are actually primitive recursive and the\nsteps described so far can be carried out in a small fragment of\nPRA. The additional principle needed to infer the\nconsistency of PA is the following:\n\n(*)There are no\ninfinite elementary recursive sequences\n\\(\\alpha_0,\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\ldots\\) such that \\(\\alpha_{n+1}\\prec\n\\alpha_n\\) holds for all n.\n\n\nTakeuti refers to (*) as the accessibility of \\(\\prec\\). Note that\nthis is a weaker property than the well-foundedness of \\(\\prec\\) which\nrefers to arbitrary sequences. There is nothing special about the case\nof PA since any ordinal analysis of a theory T\nin the literature can be made to fit this format. Thus\nepistemologically (*) is the fulcrum in any such consistency proof.\nTakeuti\u2019s central idea (1987, 1975) was that we can carry out\nGedankenexperimente (thought experiments) on concretely given\n(elementary) sequences to arrive at the insight that (*)\n obtains.[16]\n\n\n(d) Errett Bishop\u2019s novel (informal) approach to constructive\nanalysis (1967) made a great on impression on mathematicians with\nconstructive leanings. In it, he dealt with different kinds of\nmathematical objects (numbers, functions, sets) as if they were given\nby explicit presentations, each kind being equipped with its own\ngermane \u201cequality\u201d relation conceived in such a way that\noperations on them would lead from representations to representations\nrespecting the equality relation. An important ingredient that made\nBishop\u2019s constructivism workable is the systematic use of\nwitnessing data as an integral part of what constitutes a mathematical\nobject. For instance, a real number comes with a modulus of\nconvergence while a function of real numbers comes equipped with a\nmodulus of (uniform) convergence. In his explicit\nmathematics, Feferman (1975, 1979) aims (among other things) at\nformalizing the core of Bishop\u2019s ontology. Explicit mathematics\nis a theory that describes a realm of concretely and explicitly given\nobjects (a universe U of symbols) equipped with an operation\n\\(\\bullet\\) of application in such a way that given two objects\n\\(a,b\\in U\\), a may be viewed as a program which can be run on\ninput b and may produce an output \\(a\\bullet b\\in U\\) or never\nhalt (such structures are known as partial combinatory algebras or\nSch\u00f6nfinkel algebras). Moreover, some of the objects of U\nrepresent sets of elements of U. The construction of new sets\nout of given sets is either done explicitly by elementary\ncomprehension or by a process of inductive generation. If one also\nadds principles to the effect that every internal operation (given as\n\\(\\lambda x.a\\bullet x\\) for some \\(a\\in U\\)) which is monotone on\nsets possesses a least fixed point one arrives at a remarkably strong\ntheory (cf. Rathjen 1998, 1999b, 2002).\n\n(e) Martin-L\u00f6f type theory is an intuitionist theory of dependent\ntypes intended to be a full scale system for formalizing constructive\nmathematics. Its origins of can be traced to Principia\nMathematica, Hilbert\u2019s \u00dcber das Unendliche,\nthe natural deduction systems of Gentzen, taken in conjunction with\nPrawitz\u2019s reduction procedures, and to G\u00f6del\u2019s\nDialectica system. It incorporates inductively defined data types\nwhich together with the vehicle of internal reflection via universes\nendow it with considerable consistency strength.\n\n(f) Constructive set theory (as do the theories under (d) and (e))\nsets out to develop a framework for the style of constructive\nmathematics of Bishop\u2019s 1967 Foundations of constructive\nanalysis in which he carried out a development of constructive\nanalysis, based on informal notions of constructive function and set,\nwhich went substantially further mathematically than anything done\nbefore by constructivists. Where Brouwer reveled in differences,\nBishop stressed the commonalities with classical mathematics. What was\nnovel about his work was that it could be read as a piece of classical\nmathematics as well.\n\nThe \u2018manifesto\u2019 of constructive set theory was most vividly\nexpressed by Myhill: \n\n\n\u2026 the argumentation of [Bishop 1967] looks very smooth and\nseems to follow directly from a certain conception of what sets,\nfunctions, etc. are, and we wish to discover a formalism which\nisolates the principles underlying this conception in the same way\nthat Zermelo-Fraenkel set-theory isolates the principles underlying\nclassical (nonconstructive) mathematics. We want these principles to\nbe such as to make the process of formalization completely trivial, as\nit is in the classical case. (Myhill 1975: 347)\n\n\nDespite first appearances, there are close connections between the\napproaches of (d)\u2013(f). Constructive set theory can be\ninterpreted in Martin-L\u00f6f type theory (due to Aczel 1978) and\nexplicit mathematics can be interpreted in constructive set theory\n(see Rathjen 1993b, in Other Internet Resources). Perhaps the closest\nfit between (e) and (f), giving back and forth interpretations, is\nprovided by Rathjen & Tupailo 2006. Some concrete mathematical\nresults are found at the end of\n section 5.3.\n",
