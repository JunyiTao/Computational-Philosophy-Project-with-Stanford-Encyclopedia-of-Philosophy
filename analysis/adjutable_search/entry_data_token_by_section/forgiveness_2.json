    "main_text": "Cognate Phenomena || Excuse\n2.2 Excuse\n\nSometimes we do things that are indeed morally bad or impermissible,\nbut for which we are not morally blameworthy. In such cases, so-called\nexcusing conditions render an otherwise blameworthy agent not\nblameworthy. Recall our pear-taker. Suppose that you take the\npear, not from your own fruit stand, but from your neighbor\u2019s.\nYou have done something that you ought not to have done. Even so,\nthere may be facts about you or the context of your action that make\nit the case that you are not morally responsible and blameworthy. When\nwe draw attention to these facts\u2014that is, when we offer an\nexcuse for our action\u2014we are not claiming that what we did was\nnot morally wrong. Rather, we concede that what we did was morally\nwrong, but we provide putative reasons for thinking that we are not\nmorally responsible and blameworthy for having done so.\n\nWhen conduct is excused, this entails that the agent who so acted is\nnot morally responsible and blameworthy for that conduct. But when one\nis forgiven for one\u2019s conduct, this does not entail\nthat the wrongdoer was not morally responsible and blameworthy for her\nconduct. It is often claimed that a necessary condition for\nforgiveness is that the wrongdoer is morally blameworthy for her\nconduct (see, e.g., Bash 2007: 5; Haber 1991: 33; Murphy 2003; Allais\n2008; and Hieronymi 2001). Perhaps this is true (although see Gamlund\n2011). But we need not insist, as a matter of conceptual necessity,\nthat forgiveness requires that agents be morally blameworthy in order\nto show how forgiveness and excuse are distinct. For even if\nthere are certain cases in which one can be forgiven for non-culpably\nhaving done wrong (say, in moral dilemma cases), this does not change\nthe fact that forgiven agents can be morally responsible and\nblameworthy but that agents who are excused are not morally\nresponsible and blameworthy.\n",
