    "main_text": "The conceivability argument for the possibility of zombies\n3. The conceivability argument for the possibility of zombies\n\nThe simplest version of this argument goes:\n\nZombies are conceivable.\nWhatever is conceivable is possible.\nTherefore zombies are possible.\n\n\n(Kripke used a similar argument in his 1972/80. For versions of it see\nChalmers 1996, 93\u2013171; 2010, 141\u2013205; Levine 2001; Nagel\n1974; Stoljar 2001. Michael Pelczar (2021) argues for the same\nconclusion without appealing to conceivability.) Clearly the\nconceivability argument is valid. However, both its premisses are\nproblematic. They are unclear as stated, and controversial even when\nclarified. A key question is how we should understand\n\u2018conceivable\u2019 in this context.\n\nMany philosophers are willing to concede that zombies are conceivable\nin some sense (e.g. Hill 1997; Hill and McLaughlin 1999; Loar 1999;\nYablo 1999). However, that sense is sometimes quite broad. For\nexample, a claim that \u2018there are no substantive a priori ties\nbetween the concept of pain and the concept of C-fiber\nstimulation\u2019 has been backed up by the point that \u2018it is\nin principle possible to master either of these concepts fully without\nhaving mastered the other\u2019 (Hill 1997, 76). By that standard,\nthough, it would be conceivable that the ratio of a circle\u2019s\ncircumference to its diameter is a rational number, when it\nisn\u2019t. If conceivability in that sense entailed possibility, it\nwould be both possible and impossible for the ratio to be rational;\nwhich would make such conceivability useless for the purposes of the\nconceivability argument. So understood, premiss (1) would be easy to\nswallow; but (2) would have to be rejected. Evidently, the lower the\nthreshold for conceivability, the easier it is to accept (1) \u2014\nbut the harder it is to accept (2). So the kind of conceivability\ninvoked in premisses (1) and (2) needs to be strongly constrained. A\ncommon and useful definition, which will be followed here, is:\nsomething is conceivable if and only if it cannot be ruled out a\npriori. (For sophistication of these and related ideas see\nChalmers 1999, 477; 2002; 2007; 2010; and 5.1 below.) \n\nJoseph Levine discusses a version of the conceivability argument,\nseeing the conceivability of zombies as \u2018the principal\nmanifestation of the explanatory gap\u2019 (2001: 79). In his view,\nwhat creates this gap is the epistemological problem of\nexplaining how the phenomenal is related to the physical. He sees no\nway to solve this problem, and thinks it remains even if zombies are\nimpossible.\n\nCampbell, Copeland and Deng 2017 argue that, quite generally, for any\nconceivability argument there is a corresponding \u2018mirror\nargument\u2019 which can be rejected only at the cost of undermining\nthe main argument, and conclude that all conceivability arguments are\n\u2018logically bankrupt\u2019. \n\nWe now face two key questions: Are zombies conceivable in the sense\nexplained? If they are conceivable, does it follow that they are\npossible? Only if the answer to both questions is yes will the\nconceivability argument succeed. We can take them in that order.\n",
