    "main_text": "Formulating Full Rule-consequentialism || Actual versus Expected Good\n6.1 Actual versus Expected Good\n\nAs indicated, full rule-consequentialism consists in\nrule-consequentialist answers to three questions. The first is, what\nmakes acts morally wrong? The second is, what procedure should agents\nuse to make their moral decisions? The third is, what are the\nconditions under which moral sanctions such as blame, guilt, and\npraise are appropriate?\n\nAs we have seen, the answer that full rule-consequentialists give to\nthe question about decision procedure is much like the answer that\nother kinds of consequentialist give to that question. So let us focus\non the points of contrast, i.e., the other two questions. These two\nquestions \u2014 about what makes acts wrong and about when sanctions\nare appropriate \u2014 are more tightly connected than sometimes\nrealized.\n\nIndeed, J.S. Mill, one of the fathers of consequentialism, affirmed\ntheir tight connection:\n\nWe do not call anything wrong, unless we mean to imply that a person\nought to be punished in some way or other for doing it; if not by law,\nby the opinion of his fellow creatures; if not by opinion, by the\nreproaches of his own conscience. (1861: ch. 5, para. 14)\n\n\nLet us assume that Mill took \u201cought to be punished, at least by\none\u2019s own conscience if not by others\u201d to be roughly the\nsame as \u201cblameworthy\u201d. With this assumption in hand, we\ncan interpret Mill as tying wrongness tightly to blameworthiness. In a\nmoment, we can consider what follows if Mill is mistaken that\nwrongness is tied tightly to blameworthiness. First, let us consider\nwhat follows if Mill is correct that wrongness is tied tightly to\nblameworthiness.\n\nConsider the following argument, whose first premise comes from\nMill:\n\nIf an act is wrong, it is blameworthy.\n\n\nSurely, an agent cannot rightly be blamed for accepting and following\nrules that the agent could not foresee would have sub-optimal\nconsequences. From this, we get our second premise:\n\nIf an act is blameworthy, the sub-optimal consequences of rules\nallowing that act must have been foreseeable.\n\n\nFrom these two premises we get the conclusion:\n\nSo if an act is wrong, the sub-optimal consequences of rules allowing\nthat act must have been foreseeable.\n\n\nOf course, the actual consequences of accepting a set of rules may not\nbe the same as the foreseeable consequences of accepting that set.\nHence, if full rule-consequentialism claims that an act is wrong if\nand only if the foreseeable consequences of rules allowing\nthat act are sub-optimal, rule-consequentialism cannot also hold that\nan act is wrong if and only if the actual consequences of\nrules allowing that act will be sub-optimal.\n\nNow suppose instead the relation between wrongness and blameworthiness\nis far looser than Mill suggested (cf. Sorensen 1996). That is,\nsuppose that our criterion of wrongness can be quite different from\nour criterion of blameworthiness. In that case, we could hold:\n\nActualist rule-consequentialist criterion of\nwrongness: An act is wrong if and only if it is forbidden by\nrules that would actually result in the greatest good.\n\n\nand\n\nExpectablist rule-consequentialist criterion of\nblameworthiness: An act is blameworthy if and only if it is\nforbidden by the rules that would foreseeably result in the\ngreatest good.\n\n\nLet us replace \u201cforeseeably result in the greatest good\u201d\nwith \u201cresult in the greatest expected good\u201d. Here is how\nexpected good of a set of rules is calculated. Suppose we can identify\nthe value or disvalue of each possible outcome a set of rules might\nhave. Multiply the value of each possible outcome by the probability\nof that outcome\u2019s occurring. Take all the products of these\nmultiplications and add them together. The resulting number quantifies\nthe expected good of that set of rules.\n\nExpected good is not to be calculated by employing whatever crazy\nestimates of probabilities people might assign to possible outcomes.\nRather, expected good is calculated by multiplying the value or\ndisvalue of possible outcomes by rational or\njustified probability estimates.\n\nDifferent agents have different evidence and thus have different\nrational and justified probability estimates. Such differences are\nsometimes exactly what explains disagreements about what changes to an\nextant moral code would be improvements. In some cases of\ndisagreements, the cause of such disagreement is that at least one of\nthe parties is not aware of, or has not fully assimilated, evidence\nthat is available. Expectablist rule-consequentialist would likely\nwant to tie rational or justified probability estimates to the\nevidence that is available at the time, even if some people are not\naware of it or have not fully appreciated its implications.\n\nThere might be considerable scepticism about how calculations of\nexpected good are even possible (Lenman 2000). Even where such\ncalculations are possible, they will often be quite impressionistic\nand imprecise. Nevertheless, we can reasonably hope to make at least\nsome informed judgements about the likely\nconsequences of alternative possible rules (Burch-Brown 2014). And we\ncould be guided by such judgements, as legislators often say they are.\nIn contrast, which rules would actually have the very\nbest consequences will normally be inaccessible. Hence, the\nexpectablist rule-consequentialist criterion of blameworthiness is\nappealing.\n\nNow return to the proposal that, while the criterion of\nblameworthiness is the expectablist rule-consequentialist one, the\ncorrect criterion of moral wrongness is the actualist\nrule-consequentialist one. This proposal rejects Mill\u2019s move of\ntying moral wrongness to blameworthiness. There is, however, a very\nstrong objection to this proposal. What is the role and importance of\nmoral wrongness if it is disassociated from blameworthiness?\n\nIn order to retain an obvious role and importance for moral wrongness,\nthose committed to the expectablist rule-consequentialist criterion\nof blameworthiness are likely to endorse:\n\nSimple expectablist rule-consequentialist criterion of moral\nwrongness: An act is morally wrong if and only if it is forbidden by\nthe rules that would result in the greatest expected good.\n\n\nIndeed, once we have before us the distinction between (a) the amount\nof value that actually results and (b) the rationally\nexpected good, the full rule-consequentialist is likely to go\nfor expectablist criteria of moral wrongness, blameworthiness, and\ndecision procedures.\n\nWhat if, as far as we can tell, no one code has greater expected value\nthan its rivals? We will need to amend our expectablist criteria in\norder to accommodate this possibility:\n\nSophisticated expectablist rule-consequentialist criterion of\nmoral wrongness: An act is morally wrong if and only if it is\nforbidden either by the rules that would result in the greatest\nexpected good, or, if two or more alternative codes of rules\nare equally best in terms of expected good, by the one of these codes\nclosest to conventional morality.\n\n\nThe argument for using closeness to conventional morality to break\nties between otherwise equally promising codes begins with the\nobservation that social change regularly has unexpected consequences.\nAnd these unexpected consequences usually seem to be negative.\nFurthermore, the greater the difference between a new code and the one\nalready conventionally accepted, the greater the scope for unexpected\nconsequences. So, as between two codes we judge to have equally high\nexpected value, we should choose the one closest to the one we already\nknow. (For discussion of the situation where two codes have equally\nhigh expected value and seem equally close to conventional morality,\nsee Hooker 2008: 83\u20134.)\n\nAn implication is that people should make changes to the status quo\nwhere but only where these changes have greater expected value than\nsticking with the status quo. Rule-consequentialism manifestly has the\ncapacity to recommend change. But it does not favor change for the\nsake of change.\n\nRule-consequentialism most definitely does need to be formulated so as\nto deal with ties in expected value. However, for most of the rest of\nthis article, I will ignore this complication.\n",
