    "main_text": "\n\n\nPlotinus (204/5 \u2013 270 C.E.), is generally regarded as the\nfounder of Neoplatonism. He is one of the most influential\nphilosophers in antiquity after Plato and Aristotle.  The term\n\u2018Neoplatonism\u2019 is an invention of early 19th\ncentury European scholarship and indicates the penchant of historians\nfor dividing \u2018periods\u2019 in history.  In this case, the term\nwas intended to indicate that Plotinus initiated a new phase in the\ndevelopment of the Platonic tradition.  What this\n\u2018newness\u2019 amounted to, if anything, is controversial,\nlargely because one\u2019s assessment of it depends upon one\u2019s\nassessment of what Platonism is.  In fact, Plotinus (like all his\nsuccessors) regarded himself simply as a Platonist, that is, as an\nexpositor and defender of the philosophical position whose greatest\nexponent was Plato himself.  Originality was thus not held as a\npremium by Plotinus.  Nevertheless, Plotinus realized that Plato\nneeded to be interpreted.  In addition, between Plato and himself,\nPlotinus found roughly 600 years of philosophical writing, much of it\nreflecting engagement with Plato and the tradition of philosophy he\ninitiated.  Consequently, there were at least two avenues for\noriginality open to Plotinus, even if it was not his intention to say\nfundamentally new things.  The first was in trying to say what Plato\nmeant on the basis of what he wrote or said or what others reported\nhim to have said.  This was the task of exploring the philosophical\nposition that we happen to call \u2018Platonism\u2019.  The second\nwas in defending Plato against those who, Plotinus thought, had\nmisunderstood him and therefore unfairly criticized him.  Plotinus\nfound himself, especially as a teacher, taking up these two avenues.\nHis originality must be sought for by following his path.\n",
