Proof nets and processing\nIn the previous sections, we have seen how the different categorial\ncalculi can be presented as proof systems with a sequent-based\ndecision procedure.  Naive proof search in these systems, however, is\ninefficient from a computational point of view: in general, there will\nbe multiple ways to construct alternative proofs that differ only in\nthe order of the application of the inference rules, but produce the\nsame interpretation (the LP term associated with a derivation\nunder the interpretation homomorphism). This issue of\n\u2018spurious\u2019 ambiguity can be tackled by the introduction of\nnormal form derivations (as in Hepple 1990, Hendriks 1993), compare\nfocused proof search regimes in linear logic), combined with the use\nof chart-based parsing methods, as in Hepple 1999, Capelletti 2007. An\nalternative for categorial \u2018parsing-as-deduction\u2019 is to\nleave the sequent calculus for what it is, and to switch to\na proof net approach.  Proof nets, originally developed in\nthe context of linear logic, use a representation of derivations that\nis inherently free of \u2018spurious ambiguity\u2019, i.e., the issue\nof irrelevant rule orderings simply doesn't arise. For a general\ntreatment of proof nets, we refer to the entry on \n linear Logic.\n Below we comment on aspects that are specifically addressing issues in\ncategorial grammar.\nProof nets for the Lambek calculi. Proof nets for the\nassociative calculus L and the commutative variant LP\nhave been studied initially by Roorda (1991, 1992). To capture the\n\u2018intuitionistic\u2019 nature of these systems, one works with\nformulas with polarities: input (\u2018given\u2019)\npolarity for antecedent occurrences of a formula, versus output\n(\u2018to prove\u2019) polarity for succedent\noccurrences. Correctness criteria identify proof nets among a wider\nclass of graphs: to the criteria of acyclicity and connectedness,\napplicable for linear logic in general, one adds planarity to\ncapture word order sensitivity: in the proof nets for L, axioms\nlinks cannot cross.  With respect to the syntax-semantics interface,\nde Groote and Retor\u00e9 (1996) show that the lambda terms in\nCurry-Howard correspondence with LP derivations in the semantic\ntarget calculus can be read off from a proof net by specifying a set\nof \u2018travel instructions\u2019 for traversing a net; these\ninstructions then correspond step-by-step with the construction of the\nassociated lambda term.\nIncremental processing. Proof nets, considered statically as\ngraphs satisfying certain correctness criteria, remove spurious\nchoices relating to the order of rule applications in sequent calculi:\nin this respect, they represent a purely \u2018declarative\u2019\nview on categorial deductions. Johnson (1998) and Morrill (2000) have\npointed out that an alternative, \u2018procedural\u2019 view on the\nactual process of constructing a net makes perfect sense as well, and\noffers an attractive perspective on performance phenomena. Under this\ninterpretation, a net is built in a left-to-right incremental fashion\nby establishing possible linkings between the input/output literals of\nthe partial proof nets associated with lexical items as they occur in\nreal time. This suggests a simple complexity measure on an incremental\ntraversal, given by the number of unresolved dependencies between\nliterals.  This complexity measure correlates nicely with a number of\nwell-attested processing issues, such as the difficulty of center\nembedding, garden path effects, attachment preferences, and\npreferred scope construals in ambiguous constructions.\nFirst-order quantifiers.  The planarity condition singles\nout the non-commutative proof nets for L among the LP\nnets. To deal with the more structured categorial calculi discussed\nhere, the correctness criteria have to be refined. One strategy of\ndoing this is via a translation into MILL1 (first-order multiplicative\nintuitionistic linear logic) where one has proof nets with extra links\nfor existential and universal quantification over first order\nvariables. One can then use these variables in a way very similar to\nthe use of position arguments in Definite Clause Grammars as used in\nlogic programming. Moot and Piazza (2001) work out such translations\nfor L and NL. For the concatenation operations\nof L, one replaces the proposition letters (atomic formulas) by\ntwo-place terms, marking beginning and end of a continuous string. For\nnon-associative NL, one adds an extra variable to keep track of\nthe nesting depth of subformulas. For wrapping operations in the\nsimple discontinuous calculus DL (allowing a single split\npoint), Morrill and Fadda (2008) use four-place predicates.  In\ngeneral, we find a correlation here between the syntactic expressivity\nof the calculi and the number of variables needed to encode their\nstructural resource management.\nNets and rewriting.  The multimodal and symmetric calculi of\n\u00a73.1 and \u00a73.3 pose a challenge to the proof net methods as\noriginally developed for linear logic.  In these systems we typically\nfind one-way structural rules, such as the extraction postulates for\novert displacement, or the Grishin distributivity laws in the case of\nLG: these one-way rules naturally suggest a notion of graph\nrewriting. A completely general proof net framework for the\nextended Lambek calculi, with a correctness criterion based on\nrewriting, has been developed in Moot and Puite 2002 and Moot\n2007.\nThe basic building block for the Moot-Puite nets is a generalized\nnotion of a link, accommodating connectives of any arity.  A link is\ndetermined by its type (tensor or cotensor), its premises (a sequence\nP1,\u2026,Pn, 0\n\u2264 n), its conclusions (a\nsequence C1,\u2026,Cm, 0\n\u2264 m), and its main formula (which can be empty, in the\ncase of a neutral link, or one of the Pi\nor Ci). A proof structure is a set of\nlinks over a finite set of formulas such that every formula is at most\nonce the premise of a link and at most once the conclusion.  Formulas\nwhich are not the conclusion of any link are the hypotheses\nof the proof structures, whereas the formulas which are not the\npremise of any link are the conclusions.  An axiom formula is\na formula which is not the main formula of any\nlink.  Abstract proof structures are obtained by erasing all\nformulas on the internal nodes. A proof net is a proof\nstructure for which the abstract proof structure converts to a tensor\ntree \u2014 a rooted tree in the case of the intuitionistic systems,\npossibly an unrooted tree in the case of symmetric LG.  Proofs\nnets, so defined, can then be show to be the graphs that correspond to\nvalid derivations.\nThe rewriting steps transforming a candidate abstract proof\nstructure into a proof net are of two kinds.  The logical\ncontractions correspond to identities A\n\u22a2 A, for complex formulas A; they reduce a\nconfiguration of a matching tensor and cotensor link to a point.\nThe structural conversions perform an internal rewiring of a\nproof structure with\nhypotheses H1,\u2026,Hn and\nconclusions C1,\u2026,Cm to\na structure with some permutation of the Hi as\nhypotheses and some permutation of the Ci as\nconclusions. Copying and deletion, in other words, are ruled out. As\nan example, the rewriting corresponding to one of the Grishin\ninteraction principles discussed in \u00a73.3, allowing us to\ninfer C \u29b8 A \u22a2 D/B\nfrom A \u2297 B \u22a2 C\n\u2295 D. Hypotheses A, B are on the left,\nconclusions C, D on the right.  The net\nrepresentation brings out in a particularly clear way that these\nprinciples are structure-preserving: they leave the order of\nhypotheses and conclusions untouched.\n\n\n\n",
