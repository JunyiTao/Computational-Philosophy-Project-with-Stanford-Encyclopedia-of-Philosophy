    "main_text": "Objections to Functionalism || Functionalism and the Problem of Qualia\n5.5 Functionalism and the Problem of Qualia\n\nFunctionalist theories of all varieties \u2013 whether analytic or\nempirical, role or realizer \u2013 attempt to characterize mental\nstates exclusively in relational, specifically causal, terms. A common\nand persistent objection, however, is that no such characterizations\ncan capture the phenomenal character, or \u201cqualia\u201d, of\nexperiential states such as perceptions, emotions, and bodily\nsensations, since they would leave out certain essential properties of\nthose experiential states, namely, \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d\n(Nagel 1974) to have them. The next three sections will present the\nmost serious worries about the ability of functionalist theories to\ngive an adequate characterization of these states. (These worries, of\ncourse, will extend to intentional states, if, as some philosophers\nargue, \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d to have them is among their\nessential properties as well. (See Searle 1992, G. Strawson, 1986,\nHorgan and Tienson, 2002, Kriegel 2003, Pitt 2008, Mendelovici, 2018,\nfor presentations of this view, and see Bayne and Montague, 2011, and\nSmithies, 2013a and 2013b for more general discussions of whether\nintentional states possess phenomenal character \u2013 often called\n\u201ccognitive phenomenology\u201d \u2013 and if so, what, more\nprecisely, it is.)\n5.5.1 Inverted and Absent Qualia\n\nThe first to be considered are the \u201cabsent\u201d and\n\u201cinverted\u201d qualia objections most closely associated with\nNed Block (1980b; see also Block and Fodor 1972). The \u201cinverted\nqualia\u201d objection to functionalism maintains that there could be\nan individual who (for example) is in a state that satisfies the\nfunctional definition of our experience of red, but is experiencing\ngreen instead \u2013 and similarly for all the colors in the\nspectrum. It is a descendant of the claim, discussed by philosophers\nfrom Locke to Wittgenstein, that there could be an individual with an\n\u201cinverted spectrum\u201d who is behaviorally indistinguishable\nfrom someone with normal color vision; both objections trade on the\ncontention that the purely relational characterizations in question\ncannot make distinctions among distinct experiences with isomorphic\ncausal patterns. (Nida-R\u00fcmelin, 1996, argues that the science of\ncolor vision leaves open the possibility that there could be\nfunctionally equivalent red-green \u201cinverts\u201d, but even if\ninverted qualia are not really an empirical possibility for human\nbeings, given certain asymmetries in our \u201cquality space\u201d\nfor color, and differences in the relations of color experiences to\nother mental states such as emotions (Hardin 1988), it seems possible\nthat there are creatures with perfectly symmetrical color quality\nspaces for whom a purely functional characterization of color\nexperience would fail.)\n\nA related objection, the \u201cabsent qualia\u201d objection,\nmaintains that there could be creatures functionally equivalent to\nnormal humans whose mental states have no qualitative character at\nall. In his well-known \u201cChinese nation\u201d\nthought-experiment, Block (1980b) invites us to imagine that the\npopulation of China (chosen because its size approximates the number\nof neurons in a typical human brain) is recruited to duplicate his\nfunctional organization for a period of time, receiving the equivalent\nof sensory input from an artificial body and passing messages back and\nforth via satellite. Block argues that such a\n\u201chomunculi-headed\u201d system would not have mental states\nwith any qualitative character (other than the qualia possessed by the\nindividuals themselves), and thus that there could be states\nfunctionally equivalent to sensations or perceptions that lack their\ncharacteristic \u201cfeels\u201d. Conversely, some argue that\nfunctional role is not necessary for qualitative character:\nfor example, it seems that one could have mild, but distinctive,\ntwinges that have no typical causes or characteristic effects.\n\nAll these objections purport to have characterized a creature with the\nfunctional organization of normal human beings, but without any, or\nthe right sort, of qualia (or vice versa), and thus to have produced a\ncounterexample to functional theories of experiential states. One line\nof response, initially advanced by Sydney Shoemaker (1994b), is that\nalthough functional duplicates of ourselves with inverted qualia may\nbe possible, duplicates with absent qualia are not, since their\npossibility leads to untenable skepticism about the qualitative\ncharacter of one\u2019s own mental states. This argument has been\nchallenged, however (Block 1980b; but see Shoemaker\u2019s response\nin 1994d, and Balog, 1999, for a related view), and the more common\nresponse to these objections \u2013 particularly to the absent qualia\nobjection \u2013 is to question whether scenarios involving creatures\nsuch as Block\u2019s Chinese nation provide genuine counterexamples\nto functionalist theories of experiential states.\n\nFor example, some theorists (Dennett 1978; Levin 1985; Van Gulick\n1989) argue that these scenarios provide clear-cut counterexamples\nonly to crude functional theories, and that attention to the\nsubtleties of more sophisticated characterizations will undermine the\nintuition that functional duplicates of ourselves with absent qualia\nare possible (or, conversely, that there are qualitative states\nwithout distinctive functional roles). The plausibility of this line\nof defense is often questioned, however, since there is tension\nbetween the goal of increasing the sophistication (and thus the\nindividuative powers) of the functional definitions, and the goal (for\nanalytic functionalists) of keeping these definitions within the\nbounds of the platitudinous (though see Section 4.2), or (for\npsychofunctionalists) broad enough to be instantiable by creatures\nother than human beings. A related suggestion is that absent qualia\nseem possible only because of our imaginative shortcomings, in\nparticular, that it is hard for us to attend, at any one time, to all\nthe relevant features of even the simplest functional characterization\nof experiential states; another is that the intuition that these\ncreatures lack qualia is based on prejudice \u2013 against creatures\nwith unfamiliar shapes and extended reaction times (Dennett 1978), or\ncreatures with parts widely distributed in space (Lycan, 1981,\nSchwitzgebel 2015 and commentary).\n\nThere are other responses to analogous absent qualia arguments that\nare prominent in the literature, but the target of those arguments is\nbroader. Block\u2019s argument was initially presented as a challenge\nexclusively to functionalist theories, both analytic and empirical,\nand not generally to physicalistic theories of experiential states;\nthe main concern was that the purely relational resources of\nfunctional description were incapable of capturing the intrinsic\nqualitative character of states such as feeling pain, or seeing red.\n(Indeed, in Block\u2019s 1980b, p. 291, he suggests that qualitative\nstates may best be construed as \u201ccomposite state[s] whose\ncomponents are a quale and a [functional state],\u201d and\nadds, in an endnote (note 22) that the quale \u201cmight be\nidentified with a physico-chemical state\u201d.) But there are\nsimilar objections that have been raised against all physicalistic\ntheories of experiential states that are important to consider in\nevaluating the prospects for functionalism. These will be discussed in\nthe next two sections.\n5.5.2 Functionalism, Zombies, and the \u201cExplanatory Gap\u201d\n\nOne important objection, advanced by (among others) Kripke (1972) and\nChalmers (1996a), derives from Descartes\u2019s well-known argument\nin the Sixth Meditation (1641) that since he can clearly and\ndistinctly conceive of himself existing apart from his body (and vice\nversa), and since the ability to clearly and distinctly conceive of\nthings as existing apart guarantees that they are in fact distinct, he\nis in fact distinct from his body.\n\nChalmers\u2019s version of the argument (1996a, 2002), known as the\n\u201cZombie Argument\u201d, has been particularly influential. The\nfirst premise of this argument is that it is conceivable, in\na special, robust, \u201cpositive\u201d sense, that there are\nmolecule-for-molecule duplicates of oneself with no qualia (call them\n\u201czombies\u201d, following Chalmers 1996a). The second premise\nis that scenarios that are \u201cpositively\u201d conceivable in\nthis way represent real, metaphysical, possibilities. Thus, he\nconcludes, zombies are possible, and functionalism \u2013 or, more\nbroadly, physicalism \u2013 is false. The force of the Zombie\nArgument is due in large part to the way Chalmers defends its two\npremises; he provides a detailed account of just what is required for\nzombies to be conceivable, and also an argument as to why the\nconceivability of zombies entails their possibility (see also Chalmers\n2002, 2006, 2010, Ch. 6, and Chalmers and Jackson 2002). This account,\nbased on a more comprehensive theory of how we can evaluate claims\nabout possibility and necessity known as \u201ctwo-dimensional\nsemantics\u201d, reflects an increasingly popular way of thinking\nabout these matters, but remains controversial. (For alternative ways\nof explaining conceivability, see Kripke (1986), Hart (1988); for\ncriticism of the argument from two-dimensional semantics, see Yablo\n2000, 2002, Bealer 2002, Stalnaker 2002, Soames 2004, Byrne and Prior\n2006; but see also Chalmers 2006.)\n\nIn a related challenge, Joseph Levine (1983, 1993, 2001) argues that,\neven if the conceivability of zombies doesn\u2019t entail that\nfunctionalism (or more broadly, physicalism) is false, it opens an\n\u201cexplanatory gap\u201d not encountered in other cases of\ninter-theoretical reduction, since the qualitative character of an\nexperience cannot be deduced from any physical or functional\ndescription of it. Such attempts thus pose, at very least, a unique\nepistemological problem for functionalist (or physicalist) reductions\nof qualitative states.\n\nIn response to these objections, analytic functionalists contend, as\nthey did with the inverted and absent qualia objections, that\nsufficient attention to what is required for a creature to duplicate\nour functional organization would reveal that zombies are not really\nconceivable, and thus there is no threat to functionalism and no\nexplanatory gap. A related suggestion is that, while zombies may\nnow seem conceivable, we will eventually find them\ninconceivable, given the growth of empirical knowledge, just as we now\nfind it inconceivable that there could be H2O without water\n(Yablo 1999). Alternatively, some suggest that the inconceivability of\nzombies awaits the development of new concepts that can\nprovide a link between our current phenomenal and physical concepts\n(Nagel 1975, 2000), while others (McGinn 1989) agree, but deny that\nhumans are capable of forming such concepts.\n\nNone of these responses, however, would be an effective defense of\nPsychofunctionalism, which does not attempt to provide analyses of\nexperiential concepts (or suggest that there would, or could, be any\nto come). But there is an increasingly popular strategy for defending\nphysicalism against these objections that could be used to defend\nPsychofunctionalism, namely, to concede that there can be no\nconceptual analyses of qualitative concepts (such as what\nit\u2019s like to see red or what it\u2019s like to feel\npain) in purely functional terms, and focus instead on developing\narguments to show that the conceivability of zombies neither implies\nthat such creatures are possible nor opens up an explanatory gap.\n\nOne line of argument (Block and Stalnaker 1999; Yablo 2000) contends\nthat the conceivability of (alleged) counterexamples to\npsycho-physical or psycho-functional identity statements, such as\nzombies, has analogues in other cases of successful inter-theoretical\nreduction, in which the lack of conceptual analyses of the terms to be\nreduced makes it conceivable, though not possible, that the identities\nare false. However, the argument continues, if these cases routinely\noccur in what are generally regarded as successful reductions in the\nsciences, then it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that the\nconceivability of a situation does not entail its possibility.\n\nA different line of argument (Horgan 1984; Loar 1990; Lycan 1990; Hill\n1997, Hill and McLaughlin 1999, Balog 1999, Levin 2018) maintains\nthat, while generally the conceivability of a scenario entails its\npossibility, scenarios involving zombies stand as important\nexceptions. The difference is that the phenomenal, or \u201cwhat\nit\u2019s like\u201d, concepts used to describe the properties of\nexperience that we conceive zombies to lack are significantly\ndifferent from the third-personal, discursive concepts of our common\nsense and scientific theories such as mass, force or\ncharge; they comprise a special class of non-discursive,\nfirst-personal, perspectival representations of those properties.\nWhereas conceptually independent third-personal concepts x\nand y may reasonably be taken to express metaphysically\nindependent properties, or modes of presentation, no such metaphysical\nconclusions can be drawn when one of the concepts in question is\nthird-personal and the other is phenomenal, since these\nconcepts may merely be picking out the same properties in different\nways. Thus, the conceivability of zombies, dependent as it is on our\nuse of phenomenal concepts, provides no evidence of their metaphysical\npossibility.\n\nKey to this line of defense is the claim that these special phenomenal\nconcepts can denote functional (or physical) properties without\nexpressing some irreducibly qualitative modes of presentation of them,\nfor otherwise it couldn\u2019t be held that these concepts do in fact\napply to our functional (or physical) duplicates, even though\nit\u2019s conceivable that they don\u2019t. This, not surprisingly,\nhas been disputed, and there is currently much discussion in the\nliterature about the plausibility of this claim. If this line of\ndefense is successful, however, it can also provide a response to the\n\u201cDistinct Property Argument\u201d, discussed in section 3.3.\n(See Chalmers 1999, Holman 2013 for criticism of this view, but see\nthe responses of Loar 1999, Hill & McLaughlin 1999, Balog 2012,\nLevin 2008, 2018, Diaz-Leon, 2010, 2014; see also see Levin 2002,\n2008, and Schroer 2010, for the presentation, if not endorsement, of a\nhybrid view.)\n5.5.3 Functionalism and the Knowledge Argument\n\nIn another important, related, challenge to functionalism (and, more\ngenerally, physicalism), Thomas Nagel (1974) and Frank Jackson (1982)\nargue that a person could know all the physical and functional facts\nabout a certain type of experience and still not \u201cknow what\nit\u2019s like\u201d to have it. This is known as the\n\u201cKnowledge Argument\u201d, and its conclusion is that there are\ncertain properties of experiences \u2013 the \u201cwhat it\u2019s\nlike\u201d to see red, feel pain, or sense the world through\necholocation \u2013 which cannot be identified with functional (or\nphysical) properties. Though neither Nagel (2000) nor Jackson (1998)\nnow endorse this argument, many philosophers contend that it raises\nspecial problems for any physicalistic view (see Alter 2007, and, in\nresponse, Jackson 2007).\n\nAn early line of defense against these arguments, endorsed primarily\nbut not exclusively by a priori functionalists, is known as the\n\u201cAbility Hypothesis\u201d. (Nemirow 1990, 2007, Lewis 1990,\nLevin 1986). \u201cAbility\u201d theorists suggest that knowing what\nit\u2019s like to see red or feel pain is merely a sort of\npractical knowledge, a \u201cknowing how\u201d (to imagine,\nremember, or re-identify, a certain type of experience) rather than a\nknowledge of propositions or facts. (See Tye 2000, for a summary of\nthe pros and cons of this position; for further discussion, see the\nessays in Ludlow, Nagasawa, and Stoljar 2004.) An alternative view\namong contemporary functionalists is that coming to know what\nit\u2019s like to see red or feel pain is indeed to acquire\npropositional knowledge uniquely afforded by experience, expressed in\nterms of first-personal concepts of those experiences. But, the\nargument continues, this provides no problem for functionalism (or\nphysicalism), since these special first-personal concepts need not\ndenote, or introduce as \u201cmodes of presentation\u201d, any\nirreducibly qualitative properties. This view, of course, shares the\nstrengths and weaknesses of the analogous response to the\nconceivability arguments discussed above. If it is plausible, however,\nit can also challenge the argument of some philosophers (e.g.,\nChalmers, 2002, Stoljar, 2001, and Alter, 2016) that maintains that no\nphysicalistic theory, not even fundamental physics, can provide\nanything but a relational characterization of the items in their\ndomains \u2013 their structure and dynamics \u2013 and concludes\nthat no physicalistic theory can capture what seems, from the inside,\nto be the intrinsic, non-relational properties of our experiential\nstates. (See the essays in Alter and Nagasawa, 2015, Part III, for\nfurther discussion.)\n\nThere is one final strategy for defending a functionalist account of\nqualitative states against all of these objections, namely,\neliminativism (Dennett 1988; Rey 1997, Pereboom 2011, Frankish 2016).\nOne can, that is, deny that there are any such things as irreducible\nqualia, and maintain that the conviction that such things do,\nor perhaps even could, exist is due to illusion \u2013 or\nconfusion.\n6. The Future of Functionalism\n\nIn the last part of the 20th century, functionalism stood as the\ndominant theory of mental states. Like behaviorism, functionalism\ntakes mental states out of the realm of the \u201cprivate\u201d or\nsubjective, and gives them status as entities open to scientific\ninvestigation. But, in contrast to behaviorism, functionalism\u2019s\ncharacterization of mental states in terms of their roles in the\nproduction of behavior grants them the causal efficacy that common\nsense takes them to have. Moreover, functionalism, in contrast to the\npsychophysical identity thesis, seems to offer an account of mental\nstates that is friendly to materialism without limiting the class of\nthose with minds to creatures with brains like ours.\n\nMore recently, however, there has been a resurgence of interest in the\npsycho-physical (type-) identity thesis. This is fueled in part by the\nobservation that in the actual practice of neuroscience, neural states\nare type-individuated more coarsely than early identity theorists such\nas Place, Feigl, and Smart assumed, and the contention that, contrary\nto the claims of early defenders of functionalism (e.g. Putnam), there\nare relatively few extant creatures that are physically unlike humans\nbut share our functional organization. If this is so, then it may well\nbe that many of our genuine functional equivalents that differ from us\nin their fine-grained neurophysiological make-up can nonetheless share\nour neural, as well as mental, states, and thus that the\npsycho-physical identity thesis can claim some of the scope once\nthought to be exclusive to functionalism. (See Bechtel 2012, Bickle\n2012, McCauley 2012, Shapiro & Polger 2012, and Polger &\nShapiro 2016.)\n\nThe plausibility of this thesis, of course, depends on whether or not\nthese underlying similarities would in fact be (coarse grained)\nneural similarities, and not (fine-grained) psycho-functional\nsimilarities. In addition, functionalists can argue that there are\npossible creatures, both biological and (especially)\nnon-biological, that are functionally equivalent to us but do not\npossess even our coarse-grained neural properties. If so, and if these\ncreatures can plausibly be regarded as sharing our mental states\n\u2013 to be sure, a controversial thesis \u2013 then even if neural\nstates can be individuated more coarsely, some variety of\nfunctionalism will retain its claim to greater universality than the\nidentity thesis.\n\nAnother source of skepticism about the relative universality of\nfunctionalist (versus type-identity) theories derives from the\nsuggestion that \u2013 at least in humans \u2013 the properties that\ncould play the relevant roles in our functional architecture are not\nexclusively electrical impulses of our neurons, but a combination of\nthese impulses plus other features of the brain and body,\nincluding the endocrine system. (See Cao 2022 and Damasio 1999.) If\nthis is so, then there may be fewer extant examples of creatures that\nare functional, but not physical, duplicates of humans, and it may be\nless likely that such creatures are even nomologically possible. They\nmay, of course, be metaphysically possible, existing in fairly distant\npossible worlds, but there is debate about whether this is plausible,\nand if so, whether it would seriously undermine the psycho-physical\nidentity theory.\n\nOn the other hand, some critics of the psycho-physical identity theory\ncontend that only a theory that characterizes mental states as\nhigher-order properties, with causal powers not possessed by the\nstates or properties that realize them, can preserve the explanatory\nhierarchy modeled on the relations between biology and chemistry, and\nchemistry and physics. The identification of mental states with\nfunctional roles would do the trick, whether or not our mental states\nare in fact multiply realized. (See Gillett 2002, Aizawa and Gillett\n2007, 2009, and the essays in DeJoong and Shouten 2007 for further\ndiscussion; see also the entry on\n multiple realizability.)\n These questions remain the subject of active debate.\n\nYet another question is whether Role Functionalism, by itself, is as\nfriendly to materialism as its initial advocates had suggested \u2013\neven if the functional roles to be identified with mental states are\nrealized exclusively by physical states. It is generally agreed that\nthe mere supervenience of the mental on the physical \u2013 that is,\nthe impossibility of there being a mental difference without some\nphysical difference \u2013 leaves open the possibility that mental\nproperties are emergent properties with additional causal powers,\nwhereas the realization of mental states by physical states eliminates\nthis possibility. However, some say, while others deny, that\nmaterialism requires something more, namely, an explanation of how (or\nwhy) those physical properties can occupy the relevant functional\nroles. This too is a contentious question. (See, for further\ndiscussion, Endicott 2016 and Shaffer 2021).\n\nThere remain other substantive questions about functionalism. One is\nwhether it can provide an adequate account of all mental states. Most\ndiscussions of the prospects for functionalism focus on its adequacy\nas an account of familiar experiential states such as sensational and\nperceptual experiences, and familiar intentional states such as\nbeliefs and desires. But what about emotions \u2013 and moods?\nAlthough there is some discussion of these states in the functionalism\nliterature, (e.g. Rey 1990, Nussbaum 2003, deHooge, et al. 2011)\nthere is increasing interest in these questions, and more work needs\nto be done. In addition, there is increasing interest in determining\nwhether there can be plausible functional characterizations of\nnon-standard perceptual experiences, such as synesthesia, and various\nsorts of altered states of consciousness that can arise from the\ningestion of drugs, natural hallucinogenic substances, or focused\nmeditation. (See Gray et al. 2002, 2004, and Deroy 2017, for\ndiscussions of synesthesia. For general discussions of altered states\nof consciousness, see Velmans and Schneider (eds.) 2007, and\nThompson 2015.)\n\nAnother question is whether functional theories can accommodate\nnon-standard views about the location of mental states, such as the\nhypothesis of extended cognition, which maintains that certain mental\nstates such as memories \u2013 and not just their representational\ncontents \u2013 can reside outside the head. This question has\nimplications not only for the viability of a functionalist\ncharacterization of memory, but also of beliefs, emotions,\nhallucinations, and moods. (See Clark and Chalmers 2002, Clark, 2008,\nAdams and Aizawa 2008, Rupert 2009, Sprevack 2009, Byrne and Manzotti\n2022, and the essays in Menary 2010, for further discussion.)\n\nYet another question of increasing interest to philosophers is whether\ngroups of individuals, or entire communities, can possess mental\nstates (e.g. beliefs, desires, intentions, moods, and emotions) that\ncannot be reduced to the mental states of the individuals in those\ncommunities. (See Gilbert 2013.) Is it merely metaphorical to say\nthat a community (and not just the individuals in it) is optimistic,\nor conservative, or believes that human activities cause climate\nchange, or remembers the 60s? Or can claims like this be literally\ntrue \u2013 and if so, how; does it matter how many members of the\ncommunity in question individually possess the belief, intention, or\nemotion in question? It is easy to see, moreover, that answers to\nthese questions would have implications not only for theories of the\nnature of mental states, but also for theories of self-knowledge and\nknowledge of other minds. They would also have implications for\ntheories of moral evaluation: Desires and intentions lead to actions,\nand if a community intends to help resettle new immigrants or block\naccess to a public beach, then whom (or what) can we legitimately\npraise and blame for these actions, and to whom (or what) do we have\nmoral obligations?\n\nIn general, the sophistication of functionalist theories has increased\nsince their introduction, but so has the sophistication of the\nobjections to functionalism, especially to functionalist accounts of\nmental causation \n (section 5.2), \n introspective knowledge \n (Section 5.3),\n and the qualitative character of experiential states \n (Section 5.5).\nFor those unconvinced of the plausibility of dualism, however, and\nunwilling to restrict mental states to creatures physically like\nourselves, the initial attractions of functionalism remain. The\nprimary challenge for future functionalists, therefore, will be to\nmeet these objections to the doctrine, either by articulating a\nfunctionalist theory in increasingly convincing detail, or by showing\nhow the intuitions that fuel these objections can be explained\naway.",
