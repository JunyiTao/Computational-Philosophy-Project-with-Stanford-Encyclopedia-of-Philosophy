    "main_text": "Dominium in Political Thought Before Wyclif || Augustine\n2.1 Augustine\n\nAugustine's\nDe Civitate Dei was the basis for relating property\nownership and secular justice to divine authority. Here the division\nbetween two classes of men is clear: some are members of the City of\nMan, motivated by love of self, while others are motivated by the love\nof God and a contempt for self, placing them in the City of\n God.[2]\n There is really only one true Lord in creation.  Mastery of one man\nover another is the result of Original Sin and is therefore unnatural\nexcept in the case of paternity, which is founded on parental love for\na child. Among members of the City of God, the relation of prince and\nsubject is not political and does not entail the sort of mastery we\nsee in the City of Man, but rather involves service and sacrifice, as\nexemplified by the parent/child relationship.\n\n\nProperty ownership has been united to mastery in the City of Man\nbecause of Original Sin, whereby man turned away from God in the\nmistaken belief that he could make claims of exclusive ownership on\ncreated beings. This is not to say that Augustine thought that all\nprivate property relations are wrong; indeed, he is famous for having\nargued that all things belong to the just (De Civitate Dei\n14, ch. 28). But people who own things are not de facto\njust.  Those for whom ownership is not an end in itself but a means by\nwhich to do God's will are freed from the bondage of selfishness\nimposed by the Fall. They easily recognize the truth of the dictum\nthat one should abstain from the possession of private things, or if\none cannot do so, then at least from the love of property\n(Enarratio in Psalmam 132, ch.4).\n\n\nAugustine's thought on the relation of ownership to political\nauthority is open to interpretation. One can easily read him as\narguing that the Church, as the Body of Christ and earthly\ninstantiation of the City of God, can best exemplify loving\nlord/subject relations through its ecclesiastical structure, thereby\njustifying a top-down papal monarchy. Likewise, one can read him as\nhaving so separated secular political authority from the rule of love\nas to make political and ecclesiastical jurisdictive authority utterly\ndistinct. Again, one could interpret Augustine's 'all things belong to\nthe just' as meaning that the Church is the arbiter of all property\nownership in virtue of being the Body of Christ and seat of all\ncreated justice, or one could argue that the Church should abandon all\nclaims to property ownership, just as the Apostles abstained from the\npossession of private property. This ambiguity in interpretation was\nthe source of some of the competing theories that influenced Wyclif's\nposition.\n",
