    "main_text": "\n\nAnaphora is sometimes characterized as the phenomenon whereby the\ninterpretation of an occurrence of one expression depends on the\ninterpretation of an occurrence of another or whereby an occurrence of\nan expression has its referent supplied by an occurrence of some other\nexpression in the same or another\n sentence.[1]\n However, these are at best very rough characterizations of the\nphenomena, since things other than anaphoric expressions satisfy the\nfirst characterization and many cases of anaphora fail to satisfy the\nsecond. For example, in some sense of \u201cinterpretation\u201d,\nthe interpretation of the expression \u201cbank\u201d in the\nfollowing sentence depends on the interpretation of other expressions\n(in particular, \u201cof the river\u201d):\n\n(1)\nJohn is down by the bank of the river.\n\n\nBut no one would say this is an example of anaphora. And as to the\nsecond characterization, though all agree that the following is an\nexample of anaphora (and \u201che\u201d is an anaphoric pronoun here\non one reading of the sentence), it is not a case of the\nreferent of one expression being supplied by another\nexpression, (since \u201che\u201d is not a referring expression on\nthe reading in question):\n\n(2)\nEvery male lawyer believes he is smart.\n\n\nHence, rather than attempting to characterize anaphora generally and\nabstractly, we shall begin with some examples. There is generally\nthought to be many types of anaphora, though in some cases there is\ndisagreement as to whether to classify those cases as anaphora or\n not.[2]\n\nPronominal anaphora:\n\n(3)\nJohn left.  He said he was ill. (The antecedent is\n\u201cJohn\u201d and the anaphoric expression is\n\u201che\u201d.)\n\n\nVP anaphora (also called VP ellipsis):\n\n(4)\n Mary Anne\ntook out the garbage. Claudia did too. (The antecedent is \u201ctook\nout the garbage\u201d and the anaphoric expression a null VP. See\nPartee and Bach (1984), Pr\u00fcst et al. (1994).)\n\n\nPropositional anaphora:\n\n(5)\n One\nplaintiff was passed over for promotion three times. But the jury\ndidn\u2019t believe this. (The antecedent is the proposition\nexpressed by the first sentence. The anaphoric expression is\n\u201cthis\u201d. Example from Asher and Lascarides\n(2003).)\n\n\nAdjectival anaphora:\n\n(6)\n A kind\nstranger returned my wallet. Such people are rare. (The antecedent is\n\u201ckind stranger\u201d and the anaphoric expression\n\u201csuch\u201d.)\n\n\nModal anaphora:\n\n(7)\n John might\ngive a presentation. He would use slides. (The antecedent is the\npossibility described by the first sentence, and the anaphoric\nexpression is the modal \u201cwould\u201d. Example from Stone and\nHardt 1999)\n\n\nTemporal anaphora:\n\n(8)\n Sheila had\na party last Friday and Sam got drunk. (The time at which Sam got\ndrunk is anaphoric on the time at which Sheila had the party. Example\nfrom Partee 1984.)\n\n\nKind-level anaphora:\n\n(9)\n John gave\na presentation. Sarah gave one too. (The antecedent is \u201ca\npresentation\u201d, and the anaphoric expression is\n\u201cone\u201d.)\n\n\nThe antecedent also does not always have to precede the anaphoric\nexpression; when it doesn\u2019t, these are called cases of\ncataphora or backwards anaphora:\n\n(10)\n If she\ndoesn\u2019t show up soon, Jane will be disqualified from the\ncompetition.\n\n\nDespite there being many kinds of anaphora, this article will focus on\npronominal anaphora, since this is the type of anaphora that has\nreceived the most attention in the linguistics and (especially)\nphilosophical literature. Some anaphoric pronouns are referring\nexpressions that inherit their referents from other referring\nexpressions. For example, on the anaphoric reading of\n (3),\n \u201cHe\u201d inherits its referent from \u201cJohn\u201d, which\nis said to be the antecedent of the pronoun. Such anaphora is\nsimple and well understood. In cases such as\n (2)\n above, the anaphoric pronoun has as its antecedent a quantifier\n(\u201cEvery male lawyer\u201d in (2)), and essentially functions as\na variable bound by the quantifier. Again, such cases are well\nunderstood. There are some anaphoric pronouns that cannot be\nunderstood as referring expressions that inherit their referents from\nother referring expressions, nor as variables bound by quantified\nantecedents. These cases of anaphora are of interest to philosophers\nand linguists because formulating proper semantic theories for them\nhas proved to be a difficult and interesting task. Many theories of\nthese cases are currently being advocated.\n",
