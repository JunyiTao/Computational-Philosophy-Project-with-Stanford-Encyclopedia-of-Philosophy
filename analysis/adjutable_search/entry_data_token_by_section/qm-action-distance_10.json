    "main_text": "Superluminal causation\n6. Superluminal causation\n\n\nIn all the above interpretations of quantum mechanics, the failure of\nfactorizability (i.e., the failure of the joint probability of the\nmeasurement outcomes in the EPR/B experiment to factorize into their\nsingle probabilities) involves non-separability, holism and/or some\ntype of action at a distance. As we shall see below,\nnon-factorizability also implies superluminal causal dependence\naccording to certain accounts of causation.\n\n\nFirst, as is not difficult to show, the failure of factorizability\nimplies superluminal causation according to various probabilistic\naccounts of causation that satisfy Reichenbach's (1956, section 19)\nprinciple of the common cause (for a review of this principle, see the\nentry on Reichenbach's principle of the common cause).\n\n\nHere is why. Reichenbach's principle may be formulated as follows:\n\n\nPCC (Principle of the Common Cause). For any\ncorrelation between two (distinct) events which do not cause each\nother, there is a common cause that screens them off from each other.\nOr formally: If distinct events x and y are\ncorrelated, i.e.,\n\n (Correlation) \nP(x & y) \n\u2260 P(x) \u00b7 P(y),\n \n\n\nand they do not cause each other, then their common cause,\nCC(x,y), screens them off from each other, i.e.,\n\n(Screening Off) \n\n\nPCC(x,y)(x/y) =\nPCC(x,y)(x)\nPCC(x,y)(y)\n \u2260 0\n\n\nPCC(x,y)(y/x) =\nPCC(x,y)(y)\nPCC(x,y)(x) \u2260 \n 0.[29]\n\n\n\n\n\nAccordingly, CC(x,y) renders x and\ny probabilistically independent, and the joint probability of\nx and y factorizes upon\nCC(x,y):\n\nPCC(x,y)(x & y) =\nPCC(x,y)(x) \u00b7\nPCC(x,y)(y).\n  \n\n\n\nThe above formulation of PCC is mainly intended to cover cases in\nwhich x and y have no partial, non-common causes. But\nPCC can be generalized as follows:\n\n\nPCC*. The joint probability of any distinct,\ncorrelated events, x and y, which are not causally\nconnected to each other, factorizes upon the union of their partial\n(separate) causes and their common cause. That is, let\nCC(x,y) denote the common causes of\nx and y, and PC(x) and\nPC(y) denote respectively their partial causes. Then,\nthe joint probability of x and y factorizes\nupon the Union of their Causal Pasts (henceforth, FactorUCP),\ni.e., on the union of PC(x), PC(y)\nand CC(x,y):\n\n\nFactorUCP \nPPC(x) PC(y)\n CC(x,y)\n (x & y) =\nPPC(x)\n CC(x,y) (x) \u00b7\nPPC(y) \nCC(x,y) (y).\n\n\n\n\n\nLike PCC, the basic idea of FactorUCP is that the objective\nprobabilities of events that do not cause each other are determined by\ntheir causal pasts, and given these causal pasts they are\nprobabilistically independent of each other. As is not difficult to\nsee, factorizability is a special case of FactorUCP. That is, to obtain\nfactorizability from FactorUCP, substitute \u03bb for\nCC(x,y), l for\nPC(x) and r for\nPC(y). FactorUCP and the assumption that the\nprobabilities of the measurement-outcomes in the EPR/B experiment are\ndetermined by the pair's state and the settings of the\nmeasurement apparatuses jointly imply factorizability. Thus, given this\nlater assumption, the failure of factorizability implies superluminal\ncausation between the distant outcomes in the EPR/B experiment\naccording to any account of causation that satisfies FactorUCP (for\nsome examples of such accounts, see Butterfield 1989 and Berkovitz\n1995a, 1995b, section 6.7, \n 1998b).[30]\n\n\nSuperluminal causation between the distant outcomes also exists\naccording to various counterfactual accounts of causation, including\naccounts that do not satisfy FactorUCP. In particular, in Lewis's\n(1986) influential account, counterfactual dependence between distinct\nevents implies causal dependence between them. And as Butterfield\n(1992b) and Berkovitz (1998b) demonstrate, the violation of\nFactorizability involves a counterfactual dependence between the\ndistant measurement outcomes in the EPR/B experiment.\n\n\nBut the violation of factorizability does not imply superluminal\ncausation according to some other accounts of causation. In\nparticular, in process accounts of causation there is no superluminal\ncausation in the EPR/B experiment. In such accounts, causal dependence\nbetween events is explicated in terms of continuous processes in space\nand time that transmit \u2018marks\u2019 or conserved quantities\nfrom the cause to the effect (see Salmon 1998, chapters 1, 12, 16 and\n18, Dowe 2000, the entry on causal processes, and references\ntherein). Thus, recalling (sections 1, 2, 4 and 5) that none of the\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics and alternative quantum theories\npostulates any (direct) continuous process between the distant\nmeasurement events in the EPR/B experiment, there is no superluminal\ncausation between them according to process accounts of causation.\n",
