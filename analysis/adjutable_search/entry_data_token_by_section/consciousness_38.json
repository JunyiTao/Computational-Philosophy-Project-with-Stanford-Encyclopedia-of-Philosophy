    "main_text": "Specific Theories of Consciousness || Cognitive Theories\n9.5 Cognitive Theories \n\n\nA number theories of consciousness associate it with a distinct\ncognitive architecture or with a special pattern of activity with that\nstructure.\n\nGlobal Workspace. A major psychological example of the\ncognitive approach is the Global Workspace theory. As initially\ndeveloped by Bernard Baars (1988)) global workspace theory describes\nconsciousness in terms of a competition among processors and outputs\nfor a limited capacity resource that \u201cbroadcasts\u201d information for\nwidespread access and use.  Being available in that way to the global\nworkspace makes information conscious at least in the access sense. It\nis available for report and the flexible control of behavior. Much\nlike Dennett's \u201ccerebral celebrity\u201d, being broadcast in the workspace\nmakes contents more accessible and influential with respect to other\ncontents and other processors.  At the same time the original content\nis strengthened by recurrent support back from the workspace and from\nother contents with which it coheres.  The capacity limits on the\nworkspace correspond to the limits typically placed on focal attention\nor working memory in many cognitive models. \n\n\nThe model has been further developed with proposed connections to\nparticular neural and functional brain systems by Stanislas Dehaene\nand others (2000). Of special importance is the claim that\nconsciousness in both the access and phenomenal sense occurs when and\nonly when the relevant content enters the larger global network\ninvolving both primary sensory areas as well as many other areas\nincluding frontal and parietal areas associated with\nattention. Dehaene claims that conscious perception begins only with\nthe \u201cignition\u201d of that larger global network; activity in the primary\nsensory areas will not suffice no matter how intense or recurrent\n(though see the contrary view of Victor Lamme in section 9.7).\n\nAttended Intermediate Representation. Another cognitive theory\nis Jesse Prinz's (2012) Attended Intermediate level Representation\ntheory (AIR).  The theory is a neuro-cognitive hybrid account of\nconscious. According to AIR theory, a conscious perception must meet\nboth cognitive and neural conditions. It must be a representation of a\nperceptually intermediate property which Prinz argues are the only\nproperties of which we are aware in conscious experience\u2014we\nexperience only basic features of external objects such as colors,\nshapes, tones, and feels.  According to Prinz, our awareness of higher\nlevel properties\u2014such as being a pine tree or my car keys\u2014is\nwholly a matter of judging and not of conscious experience.  Hence the\nIntermediate Representational (IR) aspect of AIR.  To be conscious\nsuch a represented content must also be Attended (the A aspect of\nAIR). Prinz proposes a particular neural substrate for each component.\nHe identifies the intermediate level representations with gamma\n(40\u201380hz) vector activity in sensory cortex and the attentional\ncomponent with synchronized oscillations that can incorporate that\ngamma vector activity.  \n",
