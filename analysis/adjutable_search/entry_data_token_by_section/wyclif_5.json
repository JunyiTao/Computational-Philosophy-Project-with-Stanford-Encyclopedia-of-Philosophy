On the one hand, Wyclif believed that\nthought was linguistically constrained by its own nature; on the other\nhand, he considered thought to be related to reality in its elements\nand constitution. Hence he deemed language, thought, and external\nreality to be of the same logical coherence (see Conti 2006, pp.\n114\u201318, and Spruyt 2008, pp. 24\u201325). Within this context,\nthe theory of supposition was intended to explain the different roles\nthat words (or phrases) can have in relation to language and the\nextra-mental world when they appear as extremes (that is, as subject\nor predicate) in propositions. Characteristically, his theory of\nsupposition provides an account not only of the truth-values of a\nsentence, but also of its meaning; it is not therefore simply a theory\nof reference, but a sort of complex analysis of language viewed as a\nsemiotic system whose unique interpretative model was the reality\nitself. It gives clear evidence of Wyclif\u2019s realist choice and\nof his conviction that any kind of linguistic and semantic features\nmust be grounded on ontological structures.\n\nIn what follows, I shall consider the most important aspects of\nWyclif\u2019s theory of supposition, trying to set it in relation to\nthe medieval tradition of treatises on signification and supposition\nand particularly to its main source, the theory expounded by Walter\nBurley in his De puritate artis logicae tractatus longior\n(composed between 1325 and 1328), which contains an original and\nintelligent defence of the old view of signification and simple\nsupposition against Ockham\u2019s attacks.\n\nWyclif defines supposition as the signification of one categorematic\nextreme of a proposition (subject or predicate) in relation to the\nother extreme (De logica, chap. 12, vol. I, p. 39). This\ndefinition, which is drawn from Burley\u2019s De\nsuppositionibus (composed in 1302), sounds partially different\nfrom the standard definition of supposition, as it seems to somehow\nequate signification and supposition, since supposition is considered\nas a particular kind of signification. On the contrary, according to\nthe most common view, which went back to Peter of Spain\u2019s\nSummulae logicales, signification and supposition of terms\nwere clearly distinct functions, inasmuch as the latter presupposed\nthe former, but it was a proprietas terminorum (a term\nproperty) totally different from it. In fact, (1) signification\nconsisted in the relation of a linguistic sign to what it signifies\napart from any propositional context; (2) a word capable of standing\nfor something else or for itself in a proposition had first to have\nsignification; (3) a term only had supposition in a propositional\ncontext; and (4) the kind of supposition a term had depended on its\npropositional context. In any case, in a traditional realist\nperspective, supposition served to tell us which things are involved\nin the truth-conditions of a given sentence: whether they are\nexpressions, real universals, or individuals.\n\nAt the very beginning of the chapter on supposition, like Walter\nBurley, Wyclif divides supposition into improper, in which a term\nstands for something different from its primary significatum by\nspecial custom (ex usu loquendi), and proper, in which a term\nstands for something by the virtue of the expression itself. So a term\nhas improper supposition when it is used in a figurative speech. It is\nthe case of the term \u2018cup\u2019 in the sentence \u2018I have\ndrunk a cup <of wine>\u2019. Wyclif divides proper supposition\ninto material, when the term stand for itself or its sound (as it\noccurs in \u201c\u2018I\u2019 is a pronoun\u201d or\n\u201c\u2018Iohannes\u2019 is trisyllabic\u201d), and formal, when\nthe term stands for what it properly signifies. Formal supposition is\ntwofold: simple and personal. Like William of Sherwood, Peter of\nSpain, and Burley, and against Ockham and his followers, Wyclif\naffirms that the supposition is simple if the term stands for an\nextra-mental universal only, as it occurs in \u2018Man can be\npredicated of every man\u2019, and \u2018Man is a species\u2019.\nAccording to Wyclif, in both cases the term \u2018man\u2019\nsupposits for the human nature, which is an extra-mental form common\nto a multiplicity of singulars. Simple supposition is divided into\nequal and unequal. A term is in simple equal supposition if it stands\nfor the common nature that it directly signifies, as it occurs in\n\u2018man is a species\u2019. A term is in simple unequal\nsupposition when it stands for (1) a less common nature than that it\nsignifies, as it occurs in \u2018substance is a species\u2019, or\n(2) a concrete accident or the characterizing property (pro\naccidente vel proprio primo), as it occurs in \u2018this\nuniversal-man is capable of laughing\u2019 (\u2018hic homo\ncommunis est risibilis\u2019) \u2014 where the presence of the\ndemonstrative \u2018this\u2018 modifies the significate of the\nsubject-term \u2018universal-man\u2019, so that in the sentence it\nsupposits for that concrete exemplification (the human nature proper\nto an individual man) which is identical with the subject of inherence\n(a given human being) of the accidental form, or characterizing\nproperty (in the example, the capacity-of-laughing), signified by the\npredicate-term. The supposition is personal when the term which plays\nthe role of subject in a sentence stands for one or more individuals.\nIn the first case, the supposition is personal and singular, as it\noccurs in \u2018this man is\u2019 (\u2018hic homo\nest\u2019); in the second one, it is personal and common. The\npersonal and common supposition is twofold. If the term stands for\nmany singulars considered separately or for some (that is, at least\none) determinate individual named by the common term itself, the\nsupposition is personalis distincta (or determinate, as\nWyclif calls it in the final section of the chapter 12), as it occurs\nin \u2018these (men) are\u2019 (\u2018isti sunt\u2019).\nIf the term stands for many singulars considered together, the\nsupposition is a personal universal supposition (personalis\nuniversalis). In turn, the personal universal supposition is\ndivided into confused and distributive (confusa distributiva)\nand merely confused (confusa tantum). There is suppositio\npersonalis communis universalis confusa distributiva when the\n(subject-)term stands for everything which has the form it signifies,\nas it occurs in \u2018every man is\u2019 (\u2018omnis homo\nest\u2019). There is suppositio personalis communis\nuniversalis confusa tantum when the form (or property) signified\nby the term at issue is affirmed (or not affirmed) equally well of one\nof the bearers of that form as of another, since it applies (or does\nnot apply) to each for exactly the same reasons, as it occurs in\n\u2018both of them are one of the two\u2019 (\u2018uterque\nistorum est alter istorum\u2019), where the expression\n\u2018one of the two\u2019 has merely confused supposition, since\nnone of the two can be both of them. The confused suppositions are so\ncalled since they involve many different individuals, and this is the\ncase for the subject of a universal affirmative proposition (De\nlogica, chap. 12, pp. 39\u201340).\n\nWyclif takes a resolutely realist stand, as his formulation and\ndivision of supposition (where simple supposition is described as that\npossessed by a term in relation to a universal outside the intellect\nand personal supposition as that possessed by a term in relation to\none or more individual) make evident. In this way, he stresses the\nontological entailments of Burley\u2019s theory. In his De\nsuppositionibus and De puritate artis logicae Burley had\nadopted a semantic point of view in describing supposition, since he\nhad defined formal supposition as the supposition that a term has when\nit stands for its own significatum or for the (individual)\nitems which fall under it. In the first case, we properly speak of\nsimple supposition, and in the second, we speak of personal\nsupposition. Wyclif makes clear what Burley had stated only\nimplicitly: the significatum of a common term is always a\ncommon nature (that is, a universal form) really existing outside the\nintellect. This fits in with his theory of meaning and his\nontology.\n\nIn the first chapter of his treatise on logic (De logica,\nchap. 1, pp. 2\u20137) Wyclif maintains that: (1) a categorematic\nterm is a dictio to which a mental concept, sign of a thing,\ncorresponds in the soul. (2) Categorematic terms are divided into\ncommon (namely, general expressions), like \u2018man\u2019 and\n\u2018dog\u2019, and discrete (namely, singular referring\nexpressions), such as personal and demonstrative pronouns and proper\nnames. (3) Common terms originally and primarily signify common\nnatures \u2014 for instance, the term \u2018man\u2019 originally\nand primarily signifies the human nature. (4) Categorematic terms can\nbe divided into substantial terms, such as \u2018man\u2019, and\naccidental terms, such as \u2018white\u2019. A substantial term\nsignifies a common nature proper to a set of individuals (of which the\nterm is the name) without connoting any accidental property; while an\naccidental term signifies (but we would rather say: \u2018referes\nto\u2019) a common essence, proper to a set of individuals, and also\n(we would add: connotes) an accidental property, that is, a property\nwhich is not constitutive of the essence referred to. (5)\nCategorematic common terms can be divided also into abstract and\nconcrete. According to Wyclif, a concrete term, like\n\u2018man\u2019, is a term which signifies a thing that can have\nboth simple and personal supposition at once. On the contrary, an\nabstract term is a term which signifies only a common nature without\nconnoting anything else, like \u2018humanity\u2019 and\n\u2018whiteness\u2019. It is worth noticing that in defining\nconcrete terms Wyclif a) plainly attributes the capacity for\nsuppositing to things; b) does not clarify the metaphysical\ncomposition of such things signified by concrete terms; and c)\ndescribes the twofold supposition of concrete terms as a sort of\nsignification. (6) Finally, categorematic terms can be divided into\nterms of first and second intention. A term of first intention is a\nsign which signifies without connoting the properties of\nbeing-individual or being-universal which characterize categorial\nitems. For example, \u2018God\u2019 and \u2018man\u2019 are terms\nof first intention. On the contrary, a term of second intention is a\nterm which connotes such properties and refers to a common nature\nwithout naming it. \u2018Universal\u2019 and \u2018primary\nsubstance\u2019 are terms of second intention.\n\nAs is evident, the basic ideas of Wyclif\u2019s theory of meaning are\nthat (1) every simple expression in our language is like a label\nnaming just one essence in the world; and (2) distinctions among terms\nas well as their linguistic and semantic properties are derived from\nthe ontological features of signified things. He affirms that\neverything which exists signifies in a complex manner that it is\nsomething real (De logica, chap. 5, p. 14 \u2014 see Cesalli\n2005); expressly claims that supposition is also a property of\nsignified things; and explains the semantic difference between general\nterms, such as \u2018man\u2019, which can name a set of individuals,\nand singular expressions, such as \u2018Socrates\u2019 or \u2018a\ncertain man\u2019 (\u2018aliquis homo\u2019), which name\njust one item, by means of the different modalities of existence of\ntheir different signified things (significata). Singular\nexpressions name and signify individuals, albeit general terms name\nand signify common natures. In Wyclif\u2019s view, a common term\ngives name to a certain set of individuals only by way of the nature\nthat it originally and directly signifies, and is common to a certain\ngroup of individuals as their own quiddity (De logica, chap.\n1, p. 7). As is evident from what he says in the first three chapters\nof his De logica (on terms, universals, and categories\nrespectively), Wyclif identifies secondary substances (that is, the\nuniversals of the category of substance) with the significata\nof general (concrete) terms of that category (such as\n\u2018man\u2019 or \u2018animal\u2019) and individual substances\nwith the significata of singular expressions of that category\n(such as \u2018this man\u2019, which refers to a single human\nindividual only). Furthermore, he holds that (1) common terms of the\ncategory of substance, when used predicatively, specified which kind\nof substance a certain individual substance is; (2) individual\nsubstances are unique physical entities, located at a particular place\nin space and time; and (3) universal substances are the specific or\ngeneric natures proper to the individual substances, immanent in them,\nand apt to be common to many individuals at the same time. As a\nresult, like Burley, Wyclif thinks of universals and individuals as\nlinked together by a sort of relation of instantiation. In other\nwords, he conceives of individuals as the tokens of universal natures,\nand universal natures as the types of individuals. This consequence is\ncommon also to many other Realist authors of the 13th and 14th\ncenturies. But, because of his peculiar reading of the relation\nbetween universals and individuals, Wyclif derives from it an original\nconception of the signification and suppostion of concrete accidental\nterms, such as \u2018white\u2019, that inspired the new theories and\ndivisions of supposition developed in Oxford between 14th and 15th\ncenturies. According to them, any concrete accidental term which\noccurs as an extreme in a proposition can stand for (1) the substrate\nof inherence of the accidental form that it connotes (suppositio\npersonalis), or (2) the accidental form itself (suppositio\nabstractiva), or (3) the aggregate composed of the individual\nsubstance, which plays the role of the substrate of the form, and the\nsingular accidental form at issue (suppositio concretiva)\n(so, for instance, William Penbygull in his treatise on\nuniversals).\n\nWyclif ends chapter 12 of his De logica with three\nnotanda (pp. 40\u201342), by which he completes his\ntreatment of supposition. In the first one, he recalls that\ncategorematic common concrete terms can supposit both\npersonaliter and simpliciter at once\n(mixtim) when the propositions where they occur as subjects\nare universal affirmative or indefinite. For instance, the term\n\u2018animal\u2019 in (1) \u2018every animal was in Noah\u2019s\nark\u2019 (\u2018omne animal fuit in archa Noe\u2019 as\nwell as the term \u2018man\u2019 in (2) \u2018man dies\u2019\n(\u2018homo moritur\u2019) can supposit personaliter for\nevery individual animal and man respectively, and if so, the first\nsentence is false and the second true, and simpliciter for\nevery species of animals and the human nature respectively, and then\nboth sentences are true. In the second notandum, Wyclif\ncontends that proper names, personal and demonstrative pronouns, and\nthose terms of second intention by which we speak of the singular\nitems considered as such (namely, expression like\n\u2018persona\u2019 and \u2018individuum\u2019)\ncannot supposit distributively, since they were devised in order to\nsignify discrete vel singulariter only. Finally, in the third\none, he lays down the following rules about the supposition possessed\nby the subject-term and the predicate-term in the Square of\nOppositions: (1) in every universal affirmative proposition, the\nsubject supposits mobiliter, that is: it has confused and\ndistributive supposition, while the predicate has suppositio\nconfusa tantum or simple. The supposition is merely confused if\nit does not allow for descent to a certain singular nor a universal\n\u2014 in other words, a (predicate-)term has the supposition\nconfusa tantum when it is used attributively of its\nextension. The supposition is simple if the predicate-term refers to a\ncommon nature, as it is the case in \u2018every man is man\u2019,\nwhere the predicate \u2018man\u2019 supposits for the human nature.\n(2) Both the subject and predicate of a universal negative proposition\nhave confused distributive supposition, if they are common terms, as\nit occurs in \u2018no man is a stone\u2019. (3) In particular\naffirmative propositions, such as \u2018some man is animal\u2019,\nboth the subject and predicate have determinate supposition. (4) In\nparticular negative propositions, the subject-term has determinate\nsupposition and the predicate-term has distributive confused\nsupposition.\n\nWyclif\u2019s own discussion of the sophism I promise you a coin\nthat I do not promise (Logicae continuatio, tr. 3, chap.\n3, vol. 2, pp. 55\u201372; but see also the Tractatus de\nuniversalibus, chap. 7, pp. 133\u201335) makes evident the\nrealist stand showed by his theories of meaning and supposition. Like\nBurley before him, in his Logicae continuatio Wyclif defends\nthe claim that what is explicitly promised in such a promise, \u2018I\npromise you one or other of these coins I have in my hands\u2019\n(promitto tibi alterum illorum denariorum in altera manuum\nmearum), is the universal-coin, and not a singular one, even if I\ncan fulfil the promise only by giving any singular coin, since a\nuniversal cannot be given or possessed except by a singular\n(Logicae continuatio, tr. 3, chap. 3, p. 62). Thanks to his\ndistinction between simple and personal supposition, Wyclif is able to\nexplain from a semantic point of view the difference between promising\na coin in general and promising a particular coin: in the first case\nthe term \u2018coin\u2019 (denarius) has simple\nsupposition, and therefore the proposition is true if and only if what\nis said is true of the universal-coin; on the contrary, if the term\n\u2018coin\u2019 has personal supposition (more precisely, personal\nand singular supposition), the proposition is true if and only if what\nis said is true of a particular coin. According to him, by\npromising a singular, a universal is promised secundarie and\nconfuse, and conversely (ibid., p. 64). So, given\ntwo coins in my hands, the coin A and the coin B,\nthe proposition \u2018I promise you one or other of these\ncoins\u2019 is true, even though, when asked whether I promised the\ncoin A, my answer is \u2018No\u2019, and so too when asked\nwhether I promised the coin B. In fact, according to Wyclif,\nwhat I promised is the universal-coin, since the phrase \u2018one or\nother of these coins\u2019 has simple supposition and therefore\nstands for a universal, however restricted in its instantiations to\none or other of the two coins in my hands (ibid., p. 67).\n\nThis does not mean that the universal-coin is a sort of third coin\nover and above the two coins in my hands. Wyclif had already rejected\nthis mistaken conclusion in the previous chapter of the Logicae\ncontinuatio. He argues that to add the universal-man as a third\nman to Socrates and Plato, given that there are only these two\nindividual men in the world, exhibits a fallacy of equivocation. When\na number is added to a term of first intention (like\n\u2018man\u2019), the presence of this numerical term modifies the\nkind of supposition from simple to personal; but one can refer to a\nuniversal only with a term with simple supposition. As a consequence\nthe universal cannot be counted with its individuals \u2013 and in\nfact any universal is really identical to each one of its individuals,\nand so it cannot differ in number from each of them (ibid.,\nchap. 2, p. 48).\n\n",
