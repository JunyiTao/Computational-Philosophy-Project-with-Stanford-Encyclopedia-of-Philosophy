    "main_text": "Belief || Moral Beliefs\n6.6 Moral Beliefs\n\nPrice argues that there are no moral beliefs properly speaking: \n\n(i)\nbeliefs are things which are truth-apt, that is can be true or\nfalse, and \n(ii)\n\u201cmoral judgements\u201d are essentially expressions of the\nsentiment of approval or disapproval, something which cannot be true\nor false (1969: 398). \n\n\nUltimately, he prefers the \u201cAttitudinarian Analysis\u201d\n(1969: 379): \u201cit seems to accord with [my] own moral\nexperience\u201d (1969: 380). When we express doubt about our moral\njudgements, for instance, that simply amounts to expressing\nuncertainty about the attitude, and not an uncertainty about a fact\n(1969: 383ff). However, on various points, he argues that \n\n\nthe difference between an \u201cattitudinarian\u201d analysis of\nmoral judgements and an \u201cobjectivist\u201d analysis, in which\nthey are held to be true or false, is not quite so clear-cut as it\nlooks. (1969: 399)\n\n\nFurther, he favours Hume and Hutcheson\u2019s way of developing this\nanalysis over R.M. Hare\u2019s, which treats moral judgements as\ninjunctions or imperatives (1969: 396, 418\u2013420). He suggests\nthat to make a moral remark to another is not like telling them what\nto do but is rather a matter of laying your attitude before them, as\nan invitation to feel the same. He also claims that simply adopting a\nuniversal rule unaccompanied by feelings of approval is not sufficient\nfor having a moral attitude\u2014it is more akin to merely\ninternalising a rule. In fact, creatures without feeling cannot be\ncreatures with moral attitudes (1969: 420\u2013425). \n\nPrice aims to shrink the difference between ethical realism and\nethical non-realism. Later, more sophisticated twentieth century\nefforts largely ignored Price\u2019s interesting explorations.\n",
