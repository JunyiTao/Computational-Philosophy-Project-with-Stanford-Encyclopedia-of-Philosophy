    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe term molecular genetics sometimes refers to a fundamental\ntheory alleging that genes direct all life processes through the\nproduction of polypeptides, sometimes to a more modest basic theory\nabout the expression and regulation of genes at the molecular level,\nand sometimes to an investigative approach applied throughout\nbiomedical science that is based on investigative strategies grounded\nin the basic theory about genes. This article briefly summarizes the\nbasic knowledge of molecular genetics and surveys philosophical\nresearch on the subject. The survey is organized around three\nquestions that have dominated philosophical attention: (a) Can\nclassical genetics be reduced to molecular genetics? (b) What is a\ngene? and (c) What do genes do? It concludes by turning attention to a\nfourth question: (d) Why is so much biological research centered on\ngenes and DNA?\n",
