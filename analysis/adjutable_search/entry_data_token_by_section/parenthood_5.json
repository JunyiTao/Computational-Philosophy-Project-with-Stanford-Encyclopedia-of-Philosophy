    "main_text": "Procreative Autonomy || Anti-natalism\n2.4 Anti-natalism\n\nA further set of objections to the unburdened exercise of procreative\nautonomy is anti-natalist. Anti-natalism is opposition to procreation.\nIn its local form anti-natalism applies only to particular people in\ncertain instances. In the case where a child would predictably\nexperience a life so miserable as to be not worth living, it may be\nargued that procreation would be wrongful. Whether there are such\nlives\u2014and if so, what characterizes them\u2014is controversial,\nbut it is not unreasonable to suppose that a life can be so\nirremediably miserable that it is of no benefit to the individual who\nendures it. Arguably, the lives of those born with Tay-Sachs disease\nfit this description, and many argue that it is immoral to knowingly\nbring such children into the world. Some authors go much further than\nthis, arguing that procreating is wrong unless the parent has reason\nto think he or she can provide the child with a good chance of a\nnormal life. The general claim is that certain types of individuals\nhave an interest in not being brought into existence on account of the\nquality of life they would have were they created (McMahon 1998;\nRoberts 1998). ARTs allowing post-menopausal women to give birth have\nprompted objections to post-menopausal motherhood on grounds of child\nwelfare; but such arguments seem to employ double standards (see Cutas\n2007). Cassidy holds that prospective parents who believe they will\nnot be sufficiently competent should not procreate (Cassidy 2006).\nRelatedly, Benatar argues that autonomy rights cannot permit risking\nsevere harm to children; those who risk transmitting HIV, for\ninstance, cannot assert a right to reproduce (Benatar 2010). Local\nanti-natalism is also supported by the judgment that wrongful birth,\nbirth which wrongfully imposes undue risk and harm on a resulting\nchild, is possible (Shiffrin 1999).\n\nGlobal anti-natalism opposes procreation in general. One global\nanti-natalist position holds that in all cases procreation is a harm\nto those brought into being. Benatar argues that while existence\nbrings pains as well as pleasures, non-existence is a lack of pains\nand pleasures. While pain is bad, absence of pain and pleasure is not\nbad, so it is always worse to be than not to be (Benatar 1997, 2006;\nsee also discussion of Shiffrin 1999, below; for responses, see\nOverall 2012, Benatar and Wasserman 2015). Other global anti-natalist\npositions focus on harms or costs to others. An environmentalist\nanti-natalism argues that procreation is wrong for the same reasons\noverconsumption is (Young 2001, MacIver 2015). An opportunity-cost\nanti-natalism argues that the money spent on rearing a child would be\nbetter spent on ameliorating the lives of those already existing\n(Rachels 2014). And a misanthropic anti-natalism argues that humans\ncause so much harm \u2013 to other humans, non-human animals, and the\nenvironment \u2013 that there is a duty not to procreate (Benatar\n2015). Others have argued that the availability of children needing\nhomes creates strong moral reasons to adopt rather than to procreate\n(Friedrich 2013, Rulli 2014). There are also intermediate positions.\nFor example, Sarah Conly argues that the interests that ground a right\nto procreate can be satisfied with only one child and so it may be\npermissible to restrict the number of children an individual creates\nwhen costs to third parties from overpopulation are substantial (Conly\n2005, 2016; see also Statman 2005).\n\nNote that anti-natalists do not always defend legal restrictions,\nbecause interfering with procreation may involve intolerably illiberal\ncoercion of the person. Even those who do think that there are\ncircumstances in which interference with procreation can be justified\naccept that there are important countervailing values. For example,\nBenatar notes that the moral costs of forced abortion or sterilization\nare \u201cimmense,\u201d but thinks that the moral costs of moderate\ncoercion or directive counseling should be weighed against the moral\ncosts of harm to future children (Benatar 2010; see also the\ndiscussion of parental licensing in Section 5.2 below).\n\nOne response to anti-natalist views is to provide a justification for\nthe decision to procreate. Some authors, agreeing that procreation\nrequires a justification and that many common reasons for procreating\ncarry no moral weight, locate a possible justification in the unique\nnature of the parent-child relationship, the desire for pregnancy, or\nthe desire to pass on valuable family traits (Overall 2012, Rulli\n2016, Brake 2015, Ferracioli 2018; on whether one can make a rational\ndecision to have a child, see Paul 2015 and Krishnamurthy 2015).\n",
