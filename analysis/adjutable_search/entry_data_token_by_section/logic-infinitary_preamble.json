    "main_text": "\n\n\nTraditionally, expressions in formal systems have been regarded as\nsignifying finite inscriptions which are\u2014at least in\nprinciple\u2014capable of actually being written out in primitive\nnotation. However, the fact that (first-order) formulas may be\nidentified with natural numbers (via \u201cG\u00f6del\nnumbering\u201d) and hence with finite sets makes it no\nlonger necessary to regard formulas as inscriptions, and suggests the\npossibility of fashioning \u201clanguages\u201d some of whose\nformulas would be naturally identified as infinite sets. A\n\u201clanguage\u201d of this kind is called an infinitary\nlanguage: in this article I discuss those infinitary languages\nwhich can be obtained in a straightforward manner from first-order\nlanguages by allowing conjunctions, disjunctions and, possibly,\nquantifier sequences, to be of infinite length. In the course of the\ndiscussion it will be seen that, while the expressive power of such\nlanguages far exceeds that of their finitary (first-order)\ncounterparts, very few of them possess the \u201cattractive\u201d\nfeatures (e.g., compactness and completeness) of the\nlatter. Accordingly, the infinitary languages that do in fact possess\nthese features merit special attention.\n\n\n\nIn \u00a71 the basic syntax and semantics of infinitary languages are\nlaid down; their expressive power is then displayed by means of\nexamples.  \u00a72 is devoted to those infinitary languages which\npermit only finite quantifier sequences: these languages turn out to\nbe relatively well-behaved. \u00a73 is devoted to a discussion of\nthe compactness problem for infinitary languages and its\nconnection with purely set-theoretical questions concerning\n\u201clarge\u201d cardinal numbers. In \u00a74 an argument is\nsketched which shows that most \u201cinfinite quantifier\u201d\nlanguages have a second-order nature and are, ipso\nfacto, highly incomplete. \u00a75 provides a brief account of a\ncertain special class of sublanguages of infinitary languages for\nwhich a satisfactory generalization of the compactness theorem can be\nproved. This section includes a subsection on the definition of\nadmissible sets. Historical and bibliographical remarks are provided\nin \u00a76.\n",
