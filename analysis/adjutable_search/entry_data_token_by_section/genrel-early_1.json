    "main_text": "Machian Positivism || In the Early Einstein\n2.1 In the Early Einstein\n\nMost of Einstein\u2019s early papers (1902\u20131911) prior to his\nnearly exclusive concentration on a relativitistic theory of\ngravitation (1909\u20131915) are devoted not to the theory of\nrelativity but with problems posed to classical physics by\nPlanck\u2019s discovery of his eponymous energy constant in 1900.\nThese early works reveal Einstein to be a strong supporter of Ludwig\nBoltzmann rather than Ernst Mach in the debate over atomism at the\nturn of the century (Ryckman 2017: chapter 3). Yet in 1912,\nEinstein\u2019s name together with those of G\u00f6ttingen\nmathematicians David Hilbert and Felix Klein, was prominently\ndisplayed (in the Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau 27: 336)\namong those joining Mach\u2019s in a call for the formation of a\n\u201cSociety for Positivist Philosophy\u201d. Citing the pressing\nneed of science \u201cbut also of our age in general\u201d for a\n\u201ccomprehensive world view based on the material facts\naccumulated in the individual sciences\u201d, the appeal appears\nabove all to have been an orchestrated attempt to buttress\nMach\u2019s positivist conception of science in the face of recent\ncriticisms by Max Planck, then Germany\u2019s leading theoretical\nphysicist. More a declaration of allegiance than an act of scholarly\nneutrality, it provides evidence of Einstein\u2019s youthful\nenthusiasm for at least certain of Mach\u2019s writings. Late in life\n(1949a: 21), Einstein wrote of the \u201cprofound influence\u201d\nthat Mach\u2019s Science of Mechanics (1883) exercised upon\nhim as a student as well as of the very great influence in his younger\nyears of \u201cMach\u2019s epistemological position\u201d. Already\nin the special theory of relativity (1905), Einstein\u2019s\noperational definition of the \u201csimultaneity\u201d of distantly\nseparated events, whereby distant clocks are synchronized by sending\nand receiving light signals, is closely modeled on the operational\ndefinition of mass in Mach\u2019s Mechanics. Moreover,\noccasional epistemological and methodological pronouncements seem to\nindicate agreement with core parts of Mach\u2019s positivist doctrine\nof meaningfulness, e.g., \u201cThe concept does not exist for the\nphysicist until he has the possibility of discovering whether or not\nit is fulfilled in an actual case\u201d (1917a [1955: 22]). Thus the\ngeneral theory of relativity might be seen as fully compliant with\nMach\u2019s characterization of theoretical concepts as merely\neconomical shorthand for concrete observations or operations.\n",
