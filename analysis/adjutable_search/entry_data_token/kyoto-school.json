Introduction\n\nThe progenitor of the Kyoto School is\n Nishida Kitar\u014d[1]\n (1870\u20131945). In the Meiji period (1868\u20131912), when Japan\nreopened to the rest of the world after more than two centuries of\nnational isolation, a generation of scholars devoted themselves to\nimporting Western academic fields of inquiry, including\n\u201cphilosophy.\u201d After many years of studying Western\nphilosophy and Eastern classics, alongside a dedicated practice of Zen\nBuddhism, Nishida was the first major modern Japanese thinker to\nsuccessfully go beyond learning from the West to construct an original\nand abidingly influential system of thought. This he began to do in\nhis maiden work, An Inquiry into the Good, published in 1911\n(Nishida 1990). On the basis of this work Nishida obtained a position\nin the Philosophy Department of Kyoto University, where he went on to\nceaselessly develop his thought and to inspire subsequent generations\nof original philosophers, including the two other most prominent\nmembers of the Kyoto School: Tanabe Hajime (1885\u20131962) and\nNishitani Keiji (1900\u20131990).\n\nAs is reflected in the name of the School, its founding members were\nassociated with Kyoto University, the most prestigious university in\nJapan next to Tokyo University. It is perhaps no coincidence that the\nSchool formed in Kyoto, the ancient capital and center of traditional\nJapanese culture, rather than Tokyo, the new capital and center of\nmodernization-via-Westernization. While the Kyoto School philosophers\nall devoted themselves to the study of Western philosophy (indeed they\nmade lasting contributions to the introduction of Western philosophy\ninto Japan), they also kept one foot firmly planted in their native\ntraditions of thought. One Japanese scholar of the Kyoto School writes\nin this regard: \u201cThe keynote of the Kyoto school, as persons\neducated in the traditions of the East despite all they have learned\nfrom the West, has been the attempt to bring the possibilities latent\nin traditional culture into encounter with Western culture\u201d\n(Minamoto 1994, 217).\n\nIt would be misleading, however, if we were to think of the Kyoto\nSchool as merely putting a Western rational mask over Eastern\nintuitive wisdom. Nor would it be entirely accurate to think of them\nas simply using Western philosophical idioms and modes of thought to\ngive modern expression to East Asian Buddhist thought. For not only is\nthe Western influence on their thought more than skin deep, their\nphilosophies are far too original to be straightforwardly equated with\npreexisting Asian thought. Insofar as they can be identified as East\nAsian or Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist thinkers, this must be understood\nin the sense of having critically and creatively\ndeveloped these traditions in philosophical dialogue with Western\nthought. It should be kept in mind that their primary commitment is\nnot to a cultural self-expression, or even to a dialogue between world\nreligions, but rather to a genuinely philosophical search for\ntruth.\n\nThe Kyoto School has become most well known, especially in the West,\nfor its philosophies of religion. Indeed the initial reception of the\nKyoto School in North America took place in university departments of\nReligious Studies, where their philosophies of religion have\nfrequently been viewed as representative of East Asian\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, specifically of the latter\u2019s Zen\nand Shin (True Pure Land)\n schools.[2]\n While the exchange on these terms has been fruitful, this view can be\nmisleading in two respects. First of all, even if, for most of the\nKyoto School thinkers, a philosophy of religion is the ultimate\narche and telos of their thought, it is hardly their\nsole concern. They address a full array of philosophical issues:\nmetaphysics, ontology, epistemology, logic, philosophical\nanthropology, philosophy of history, philosophy of culture, philosophy\nof language, ethics, political theory, philosophy of art, etc.\n\nSecondly, even when their focus is on the philosophy of religion, they\napproach this topic in a non-dogmatic and often surprisingly\nnon-sectarian manner, drawing on and reinterpreting, for example,\nChristian sources along with Buddhist ones. Even Nishitani, who did in\nfact come to identify his thought with \u201cthe standpoint of\nZen,\u201d adamantly refused the label of a \u201cnatural theologian\nof Zen.\u201d He claimed: \u201cIf I have frequently had occasion to\ndeal with the standpoints of Buddhism, and particularly Zen Buddhism,\nthe fundamental reason is that [the original form of reality and the\noriginal countenance of human being] seem to me to appear there most\nplainly and unmistakably\u201d (NKC X, 288; Nishitani 1982, 261).\n\nKyoto School philosophy, therefore, should be understood neither as a\nbody of Buddhist thought forced into the form of Western garb, nor as\nuniversal discourse (which the West is supposed to have invented or\ndiscovered) dressed up in Japanese garb. Rather, it is best understood\nas a set of unique contributions from the perspective of modern\nJapan\u2014that is, from a Japan that remains substantially\nundergirded by its historical layers of traditional culture at the\nsame time as being thoroughly remodeled by its most recent layer of\nmodernization via appropriation of Western culture\u2014to a nascent\nworldwide dialogue of cross-cultural philosophy.\n\nThis article will proceed as follows. In the following section, I will\nconsider the preliminary issues of how to define the Kyoto School and\nwho to include as its members. The name \u201cKyoto School\u201d has\nbeen used in the past, in some cases rather loosely, to refer to a\nvariety of sets of thinkers. It is therefore necessary to begin by\ndiscussing the question: Just who belongs to exactly what? The third\nand central section of this article will treat what is generally\nconsidered to be the central philosophical concept and contribution of\nthe Kyoto School, namely, its ideas of \u201cabsolute\nnothingness.\u201d After discussing the ostensible contrast between\n\u201cWestern being\u201d and \u201cEastern nothingness,\u201d and\nafter looking at some of the Buddhist and Daoist sources of the idea\nof absolute nothingness, I will discuss the topological, dialectical,\nphenomenological, and existential philosophies of absolute nothingness\ndeveloped by Nishida Kitar\u014d, Tanabe Hajime, Nishitani Keiji, and\nthe central figure of the third generation of the Kyoto School, Ueda\nShizuteru (1926\u20132019). The fourth section will address the\npolitical controversy surrounding the wartime writings and activities\nof the Kyoto School. The first wave of attention paid to the Kyoto\nSchool in the West in the 1980s largely ignored the political debate\nthat had long surrounded the School in Japan. While this lacuna in\nWestern scholarship was amended in the 1990s, notably with the\npublication of Rude Awakenings: Zen, the Kyoto School and the\nQuestion of Nationalism (Heisig & Maraldo 1994), the\npolitical ventures and misadventures of the Kyoto School remain a\nhighly contentious subject (see Maraldo 2006 and Goto-Jones 2008). In\nthe final section of this article I will return to the question of the\ncross-cultural legacy of the Kyoto School as a group of thinkers that\nstood between\u2014and even moved beyond\u2014\u201cEast and\nWest.\u201d\n2. Identity and Membership: Who Belongs to What?\n2.1 A History of External Naming\n\nThere has been considerable discussion surrounding the question of how\nto define the Kyoto School, and who to include as its members. By all\naccounts Nishida Kitar\u014d is the School\u2019s originator. (See\nthe entry on\n Nishida Kitar\u014d.)\n Yet it was never his intention to institute a \u201cschool\u201d\nbased on his own thought; in fact he is reported to have always\nencouraged independent thinking in his students. Moreover, unlike\nPlato\u2019s Academy or the Frankfurt School\u2019s Institute for\nSocial Research, the Kyoto School thinkers never founded an academic\ninstitution or formed an official organization (at least until The\nNishida Philosophy Association was founded in 2003; see the website\nlisted below). Their association was initially based merely on the\nfact that they studied and taught at Kyoto University and developed\ntheir thinking under the influence of Nishida as well as in dialogue\nand debate with him and with one another. Indeed the name \u201cKyoto\nSchool\u201d only came into use by the \u201cmembers\u201d\nthemselves much later, when at all.\n\nNames do not only tell us who or what something is; they also tell us\nwho or what something is not. Definitions not only seek to reveal an\ninternal essence; they also draw a line of demarcation between inside\nand outside. It is thus not surprising that names and definitions\noften have their origin in labels appended from without. These labels\nmay subsequently degenerate into stereotypes; or, conversely, they may\nbe positively appropriated and redefined by the group itself. Both of\nthese processes can be seen in the history of the \u201cKyoto\nSchool.\u201d\n\nThe name \u201cKyoto School,\u201d in fact, originated from without;\nor, more precisely speaking, it originated from the fringes of the\nSchool itself. Tosaka Jun (1900\u20131945), a student of Nishida and\nTanabe, coined the expression in 1932 in reference to Nishida, Tanabe\nand Miki Kiyoshi (1897\u20131945) as purportedly representative of\nthe epitome of \u201cbourgeois philosophy in Japan\u201d (see Heisig\n2001, 4). Tosaka\u2019s own developing thought had an explicitly\nmaterialist and Marxist orientation (see Tosaka 2014), and in his\narticle he criticized the School as promulgating a bourgeois idealism\nthat ignores material historical conditions and issues of social\npraxis. Tosaka\u2019s critique had an impact on the subsequent\ndevelopment of the Kyoto School\u2019s philosophies, and ironically\nTosaka himself is today considered by some to belong, together with\nMiki, to the \u201cleft wing\u201d of the Kyoto School (see Hattori\n2004).\n\nThe second significant moment in the naming (or\n\u201clabeling\u201d) of the Kyoto School came more clearly from\nwithout, and in an even more politically charged context. As Nishitani\nwas to recollect years later: \u201cThe name \u2018Kyoto\nSchool\u2019 is a name journalists used in connection with\ndiscussions that friends of mine and I held immediately before and\nduring the war\u201d (NKC XI, 207; see Heisig 2001, 277). Nishitani\nis referring here to a series of symposia that addressed the question\nof the meaning and direction of the Pacific War and another symposium\non the question of \u201covercoming modernity.\u201d These\ncontroversial symposia will be discussed in subsection 4.3 of this\narticle. In his retrospective comments, penned in 1977, Nishitani goes\non to say that by that time the name \u201cKyoto School\u201d had\ncome to be used by Americans and others to \u201cindicate purely a\nschool of thought.\u201d\n\nSince the 1970s the name \u201cKyoto School\u201d has gradually\nrecovered its underlying philosophical ring, which for several decades\nin Japan (especially outside of Kyoto) had been drowned out by its\npolitical overtones. This recovery happened first of all in the West,\nwhere scholars neglected the political controversies in their\nenthusiastic reception of the School\u2019s philosophies of religion.\nWhile the political controversies returned with a vengeance to Western\nacademia a couple of decades later, in a kind of pendulum swing to the\nhypercritical, the initial positive attention from the West had by\nthen helped to rehabilitate the image of the Kyoto School back home in\nJapan.\n\nFujita Masakatsu suggests that the question of defining the identity\nof the Kyoto School has often been a more pressing issue for Western\nscholars than for the Japanese themselves. He speculates that there\nare two reasons for this. One is that the Kyoto School never really\nhad any noteworthy competing schools of original thought within Japan\nwith which to contrast itself, and over against which to explicitly\ndefine its own identity. The second reason is that, while Westerners\ntend to draw out and focus on the shared general characteristics of\nthe School\u2019s thinkers, usually in contrast with the general\ncharacteristics of Western thought, for Japanese scholars of the Kyoto\nSchool the differences between the various thinkers often appear in\nsharper relief than do their shared commonalities (Fujita 2001,\nii).\n\nIn any case, just as the formation of the Kyoto School\u2019s ideas\ntook place between Western and East Asian horizons of thought, so has\nthe scholarly study and, to some extent, even the defining of the\nKyoto School taken place between scholars in Japan on the one hand and\nthose in Europe and North America on the other. Since one of the\ncommon characteristics of the Kyoto School philosophers is their\nattempt to set Japan and their own thought in the context of the wider\nworld, it is fitting that, with the increasingly international study\nof the Kyoto School, their thought is finally becoming what it always\nintended to be, namely, \u201cJapanese philosophy in the world\u201d\n(see Heisig 2004; Fujita & Davis 2005; Davis & Schroeder &\nWirth 2011).\n2.2 The Question of Definition\n\nAt the start of the twenty-first century, two important volumes\nappeared in Japanese with the name \u201cKyoto School\u201d in their\ntitles: The Philosophy of the Kyoto School, edited by Fujita\nMasakatsu (2001; translated into English as Fujita 2018), which\nconsists of an anthology of texts by eight Kyoto School thinkers\ntogether with an essay on each one by a contemporary scholar; and\nThe Thought of the Kyoto School, edited by \u014chashi\nRy\u014dsuke (2004), which contains five essays detailing the\ncontroversial history of the name \u201cKyoto School\u201d as well\nas seven essays on potential contributions of their thought to various\nfields of contemporary philosophy. While the two books complement one\nother in many respects, they nevertheless suggest somewhat different\napproaches to defining the school.\n\nFujita agrees with Takeda Atsushi\u2019s working definition of the\nKyoto School as: \u201cthe intellectual network that was centered on\nNishida and Tanabe, and mutually formed by those who were directly\ninfluenced in both a personal and scholarly manner by them\u201d\n(Fujita 2001, ii and 234\u201335). Accordingly, Fujita\u2019s book\nfeatures such thinkers as Tosaka and Miki, as well as unanimously\naccepted figures such as Hisamatsu Shinichi (1889\u20131980) and\nNishitani. As Fujita points out, the relatively open definition of the\nKyoto School as such a scholarly and interpersonal\n\u201cnetwork\u201d has the advantage of highlighting the mutuality\nof the flow of influence between its members, as well as the fact that\n\u201cmembership\u201d in the unofficial group did not preclude\nserious disagreement with the thought of Nishida or Tanabe. While\ncritical exchanges did sometimes lead to severed personal relations\n(e.g., Nishida and Tanabe infamously stopped speaking to one another),\nthis was not always the case (e.g., Nishitani and Tosaka remained on\ngood personal terms despite their political and philosophical\ndifferences). In either case mutual criticism was philosophically\ntaken seriously, and it frequently provided impetus to further\ndevelopments in each member\u2019s thought. In this sense, according\nto Fujita, an acceptance of mutual criticism could well be considered\none of the defining characteristics of the School.\n\nOne point made by Tosaka early on, a point often repeated today, is\nthat without Tanabe\u2019s critical appropriation of\nNishida\u2019s thought there would be no tradition of the Kyoto\nSchool; we would have only successors of \u201cNishidian\nPhilosophy\u201d and not a genuine school of mutually related yet\nindependent thinkers. The question remains, however, just how\nindependent a thinker can be with respect to Nishida\u2019s thought\nand still be considered a member of the School. For even when\nsubsequent figures in the School sharply questioned certain aspects of\nNishida\u2019s thought, they tended at the same time to appropriate\nand creatively develop other shared concepts and motifs. A movement of\nself-critical development can in fact be seen in the ceaseless\nprogression of Nishida\u2019s own thinking. Nishida considered\nhimself to be a \u201cminer of ore\u201d who never managed to stay\nput in one stage of development long enough to refine the ideas he had\nunearthed (Nishida 1958, vii; on the development of Nishida\u2019s\nthought, see Fujita 2020 and the entry on Nishida Kitar\u014d).\n\nHence the Kyoto School, like many other vibrant schools of thought,\nshould be seen as a cluster of original thinkers who, while not\nuncritically subscribing to any prescribed dogma, nevertheless came to\nshare, and debate, a number of common motifs as well as basic concepts\nand terminology. As we shall see, the most fundamental of their shared\nand disputed concepts is that of \u201cabsolute nothingness,\u201d a\nconcept that has, in fact, most often been used as a thematic axis for\ndefining the School.\n\nIn contrast to Fujita, \u014chashi explicitly questions the\nappropriateness of defining the Kyoto School merely in terms of a\nnetwork of personal and scholarly relations. According to \u014chashi,\nin order for a group of thinkers to form a genuine\n\u201cschool\u201d of philosophy, \u201cthere must be the common\npossession or formation of a thought\u201d (\u014chashi 2004, 9). For\n\u014chashi, this common thought of the Kyoto School is that of\nabsolute nothingness, and he accordingly suggests the following as a\ndefinition of the School: \u201ca group of philosophers spanning\nseveral generations who developed their thought in several areas of\nphilosophy with the idea of \u2018nothingness\u2019 as a\nbasis\u201d (ibid., 10; see \u014chashi 2001, 13). While he does\ninclude Hattori Kenji\u2019s essay on the \u201cleft wing of the\nKyoto School\u201d as the opening chapter of his The Thought of\nthe Kyoto School, previously \u014chashi explicitly excluded Miki\nfrom the School on account of his principally Marxists orientations\n(\u014chashi 1990, 12). However, we should note that while Miki did\nnot maintain a strict adherence to Marxism (see Curley 2020 and\nKrummel\u2019s introduction to Miki 2024), he did maintain a close\nrelationship with Nishida, with whom he published several dialogues in\nthe 1930s. Not only was Miki one of the former students who inspired\nNishida to take an interest in Marxism during this period, but\nMiki\u2019s own mature philosophical anthropology and philosophy of\nsociety and history remained influenced by Nishida. Indeed, in his\nunfinished magnum opus, The Logic of Imagination (Miki 2024),\nwhile explicitly engaging with the texts of Dewey, Hume, and\nespecially Kant, Miki sets forth the Nishida-inspired idea that a\ncreative \u201cnothingness is what transcends the subjective and the\nobjective and envelopes them\u201d (quoted in Fujita 2011, 315).\n\nAmong Western scholars, John Maraldo has most thoroughly probed the\nquestion of Kyoto School identity and membership. He isolates six\ncriteria that scholars have used to include and exclude thinkers from\nthe Kyoto School: (1) connection with Nishida; (2) association with\nKyoto University; (3) stance toward Japanese and Eastern intellectual\ntraditions; (4) stance toward the interrelated matters of Marxism, the\nnation state, and the Pacific War; (5) stance toward Buddhism and\ntoward religion in general; and (6) stance toward the notion of\nabsolute nothingness. Maraldo shows how each one of these criteria\nhave been used in various ways, consciously or unconsciously, since\nthe 1930s to either promote the philosophical significance or\ndisparage the political ideology of the Kyoto School (Maraldo 2005,\n33\u201338).\n\nI would add two more related and interrelated criteria. One is an\nessentially ambivalent stance (i.e., neither simple rejection\nnor simple acceptance) toward Western philosophy and the West in\ngeneral. For example, Nishida and others undertake a critical\nreception of Western ontology in order to develop an Eastern\nmeontology or \u201clogic of nothingness,\u201d and attempt to\ncombine a Western \u201clogic of things\u201d with an Eastern\n\u201clogic of heart-mind.\u201d I will discuss such issues in\nsection 3 of this article.\n\nAnother criterion that could be used to define the School is an\nessentially ambivalent attitude toward Western modernity (or\ntoward modernization as Westernization). A critical stance toward a\nunilateral globalization of Western modernity, a stance which at the\nsame time accepts in part its unavoidability and in some respects even\naffirms its necessity, was expressed with the idea being discussed at\nthe time of \u201covercoming modernity.\u201dAccording to Kyoto\nSchool philosophers, this overcoming would take place not by\nretreating from Western modernity (as some romantic and conservative\nthinkers asserted), but rather by going through and beyond\nit. This going through and beyond, moreover, would not simply be a\nmatter of going further down the road of linear progress; it would\nentail a hermeneutical as well as ultimately a (me)ontological and\nexistential re-gress, a radical \u201cstep back.\u201d For Kyoto\nSchool philosophers such as Nishitani, a critical and creative\nretrieval of the traditions of East Asia, those of East Asian\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism in particular, is thought to enable the\nradical religious and philosophical \u201ctrans-descendence\u201d\nnecessary to move through and beyond the limits and problems of\nWestern modernity (see Nishitani 2008; Nishitani 1990, 173\u201381;\nDavis 2004).\n\nThis idea of \u201covercoming modernity\u201d has proven to be both\none of the more provocative and controversial aspects of their\nthought. For some it promises to contribute an important East Asian\nperspective to debates over postmodernism in philosophy and\npostcolonialism in culture studies. Yet because the Kyoto\nSchool\u2019s ideas of \u201covercoming modernity\u201d developed\nin conjunction with their wartime political theories, theories which\ntypically saw the nation of Japan as playing a key role in the\nhistorical movement through and beyond Western modernity, it has also\nproven to be one of the most criticized aspects of their thought. (It\nis noteworthy in this regard that many postwar Japanese proponents of\n[Western] postmodernism eschewed making the connection between their\nadoption of recent Western self-criticism of modernity/Eurocentrism\nand the Kyoto School\u2019s earlier critique of these. A noteworthy\nexceptions is Nakamura Y\u016bjir\u014d, and the neo-Marxist\nphenomenologist Hiromatsu Wataru also surprised Japanese academia by\nreviving interest in this aspect of the Kyoto School\u2019s legacy.)\nIn any case, it is true that even after the Kyoto School ceased\nformulating the idea of overcoming modernity in political terms,\nelements of the idea live on in their postwar philosophies of religion\nand culture. Hence, a radical problematization of Western modernity\ncan be considered an important aspect of their identity as a school of\nthought.\n\nAnother significant Western contributor to the question of the Kyoto\nSchool\u2019s identity is James Heisig, who succeeded Jan Van Bragt\nas the head of the Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture in\nNagoya, an institute which has for several decades now been at the\ncenter of international research on the Kyoto School. In his book,\nPhilosophers of Nothingness: An Essay on the Kyoto School,\nHeisig suggests that we follow the lead of Takeuchi Yoshinori\n(1913\u20132002) and define the School by \u201ctriangulating\u201d\nit around the three leading figures of Nishida, Tanabe, and Nishitani\n(Heisig 2001, 3\u20137 and 275\u201378).\n\nIt is indeed these three figures that form the core of what has become\nknown as the Kyoto School, and in this article I will accordingly\nfocus my attention primarily on them, as well as at times on Ueda\nShizuteru, the leading figure of the third generation of the School.\nIt should nevertheless be kept in mind that these are only four of a\nmuch wider group of original thinkers, some squarely within and some\nmore or less on the periphery of the Kyoto School.\n2.3 Members and Associates\n\n\u014chashi Ry\u014dsuke\u2019s thesis, advanced already in his\nlandmark German anthology, Die Philosophie der\nKy\u014dto-Schule (1990, revised edition 2012; see also\n\u014chashi and Akitomi 2018), is that the Kyoto School should be\nunderstood as a group of thinkers involved in a pluralistic yet\ncooperative and sustained attempt to think on the basis of an idea of\n\u201cnothingness\u201d or \u201cabsolute nothingness.\u201d This\ndistinguishes their thought from that of traditional Western onto-logy\nbased on the concept of \u201cbeing.\u201d With this definition in\nmind, \u014chashi lists the central members of the Kyoto School\naccording to generation as follows: Nishida and Tanabe make up the\nfirst generation; Hisamatsu, Nishitani, K\u014dsaka Masaaki\n(1900\u20131969), Shimomura Toratar\u014d (1900\u20131995),\nK\u014dyama Iwao (1905\u20131993), and Suzuki Shigetaka\n(1907\u20131988) make up the second generation; and Takeuchi\nYoshinori (1913\u20132002), Tsujimura K\u014dichi (1922\u20132010),\nand Ueda Shizuteru make up the third generation. Elsewhere he also\nsuggests that the psychologist Kimura Bin (b. 1931) could be\nconsidered part of the third generation of the School, particularly if\nwe shift the criterion of definition from interpersonal relations to a\ngenealogy of thought (\u014chashi 2004, 9).\n\nUeda developed an original philosophy of Zen in relation to Meister\nEckhart and Nishida. Takeuchi wrote important works on the philosophy\nof religion from a Shin Buddhist perspective. Tsujimura, who studied\nunder Heidegger as well as under Hisamatsu and Nishitani, has\nprovocatively and influentially written on Heidegger\u2019s thought\nfrom a Zen and Kyoto School perspective. Abe Masao (1915\u20132006),\na former student of Hisamatsu\u2019s, was an important representative\nof the Kyoto School and contributor to inter-religious dialogue in\nNorth America, although he is somewhat less well known in Japan\nitself. If we were to view the Kyoto School as living past its third\ngeneration, \u014chashi Ry\u014dsuke (b. 1944), a prolific philosopher\nin his own right, whose works in both Japanese and German address a\nbroad range of philosophical issues, would undoubtedly count as a\ncentral figure of its fourth generation. Other recent affiliates of\nthe School, who could be seen as belonging to its fourth generation,\ninclude Hase Sh\u014dt\u014d, Horio Tsutomu, \u014cmine Akira, Fujita\nMasakatsu, Mori Tetsur\u014d, Hanaoka (Kawamura) Eiko, Matsumura\nHideo, Nakaoka Narifumi, Okada Katsuaki, and Keta Masako. If the\nSchool shows promise of living on to future generations, it is with\ncurrently active Japanese scholars such as Akitomi Katsuya, Minobe\nHitoshi, Itabashi Y\u016bjin, Uehara Mayuko, Inoue Katsuhito, Mine\nHideki, Kosaka Kunitsugu, Tanaka Y\u016b, and Tanaka Ky\u016bbun, and\nas well as with a number of Japanese and non-Japanese philosophers\nliving outside of Japan, some of whom have studied and worked\nextensively with members of the third and fourth generations of the\nSchool.\n\nWe appear to be at a turning point in the history of the Kyoto School,\nas is reflected in current retrospective attempts to define it. With\nUeda\u2019s and then Hase\u2019s retirements from Kyoto University,\non the one hand, and with the creation in 1996 of a Department of the\nHistory of Japanese Philosophy at Kyoto University (see the website\nlisted below) under the head of Fujita Masakatsu and now Uehara Mayuko\non the other, the Kyoto School is becoming as much an object of\nscholarship as it is a living tradition. However, as with most schools\nof philosophy, the line between critical scholarship and creative\ndevelopment is hardly a clear one, and in practice the retrospective\nstudy of the Kyoto School often blends together with its further\nunfolding as a still vibrant school of thought.\n\nIt is also important to point out that today in Japan the Kyoto School\nis not only studied in Kyoto. Since the appearance of Tokyo-based\nphilosopher Nakamura Y\u016bji\u014d\u2019s first book on Nishida in\n1983, Nishida and the Kyoto School have increasingly received\nattention from scholars and students in areas of Japan beyond Kyoto.\nWorth special mention in this regard is Kosaka Kunitsugu, whose lucid\nand prolific scholarship on Nishida and others has done a great deal\nfor the sympathetic yet sober textual analysis of the Kyoto School.\nThe creation of the Nishida Philosophy Association in 2003 (see the\nwebsite listed below) has helped inaugurate a new era of cooperative\nexchange between scholars from various areas of Japan as well as from\nabroad.\n\nOne final point on the question of membership: consideration should\nalso be given to those who could be referred to as \u201crelated\nthinkers\u201d or \u201cassociate members\u201d of the Kyoto\nSchool. The widest understandings (or\n misunderstandings[3])\n of the Kyoto School include in it a number of thinkers who have a\nmore or less peripheral relation to the inner circle of the School.\nFor example, there is the case of the well-known Zen scholar and\nthinker, D. T. Suzuki (Suzuki Daisetsu) (1870\u20131966). Suzuki\nmaintained a long personal relationship with Nishida since their days\nas schoolmates. He not only helped introduce the young Nishida to the\npractice of Zen, his articulation of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist\nthought is also acknowledged by Nishida as having influenced the\nformation of certain key ideas in his last essay on the philosophy of\nreligion (see Nishida 1987, 70, 85\u201386, 108, 122\u201323). But\nSuzuki\u2014who is justifiably famous in his own right for, among\nother things, helping introduce Zen to the West\u2014was neither\ntrained as an academic philosopher nor associated with Kyoto\nUniversity; and thus he is perhaps best thought of as a \u201cclosely\nrelated thinker\u201d to the School.\n\nThere are also the noteworthy cases of Watsuji Tetsur\u014d\n(1889\u20131960) and Kuki Sh\u016bz\u014d (1888\u20131941). Both of\nthese philosophers were brought to Kyoto University by Nishida, and\nboth developed philosophies which were more or less influenced by\nNishida\u2019s thought (see Maraldo 2005, 34 and 52). And yet, both\ntheir ideas and their activities remained too independent to count\nthem among the inner circle of the School. It should be kept in mind,\nhowever, that these two \u201cassociates\u201d in particular are\nfirst rate philosophers in their own right, whose original work\noutshines that of many of the less original though full-fledged\nmembers of the School. Watsuji\u2019s novel theory of \u201cculture\nand climate\u201d (f\u016bdo), together with his major work\non the ethics of \u201cbetweenness\u201d (aidagara), and\nKuki\u2019s combination of logical rigor and existential insight in\nhis major writings on the problem of contingency, together with his\nprovocative works on Japanese aesthetics (notably his hermeneutical\nphenomenology of \u201ciki\u201d), have each made lasting\ncontributions to philosophy and are worthy of international scholarly\nattention (see the entry on Watsuji Tetsur\u014d; McCarthy 2020;\nMayeda 2020).\n\nFinally, there is the matter of thinkers who have developed their\nideas more or less under the influence of Nishida and other members of\nthe Kyoto School. A complete list of this group of \u201cinfluenced\nthinkers\u201d would be long, but it would include such names as\nTakahashi Satomi, Takizawa Katsumi, Mutai Risaku, Yuasa Yasuo, Kimura\nBin, Sakabe Megumi, Nakamura Y\u016bjir\u014d, and Noe Keiichi. A\nnumber of non-philosophers, such as the world-famous architect\nAnd\u014d Tadao (Tadao Ando), who designed the Ishikawa Nishida Kitaro\nMuseum of Philosophy (see the website listed below), have also been\ninfluenced by Nishida and the Kyoto School.\n3. Absolute Nothingness: Giving Philosophical Form to the Formless\n\nHaving discussed issues of definition and membership of the Kyoto\nSchool, we are now prepared to pursue the question of what unifies\ntheir thought as a school of philosophy. I will here follow the\nsuggestion of \u014chashi, Nishitani, and other representatives of the\nKyoto School itself, and focus on the shared\u2014and at times\ndisputed\u2014idea of \u201cabsolute nothingness\u201d\n (zettai-mu).[4]\n3.1 Western Being vs. Eastern Nothingness? Ontology vs. Meontology?\n\nNishitani wrote the following with regard to Nishida and Tanabe:\n\u201c[Their] philosophies share a distinctive and common basis that\nsets them apart from traditional Western philosophy: absolute\nnothingness. \u2026 Clearly the idea of absolute nothingness came to\nawareness in the spirituality of the East; but the fact that it has\nalso been posited as a foundation for philosophical thought represents\na new step virtually without counterpart in the history of Western\nphilosophy\u201d (NKC IX, 225\u201326; Nishitani 1991, 161).\n\n\u201cFirst philosophy\u201d in the Western tradition is ontology,\nwhich asks the question of \u201cbeing qua being,\u201d and tends to\nanswer this question either in terms of the most universal\n\u201cbeing-ness\u201d or in terms of the \u201chighest\nbeing.\u201d For Aristotle, the primary category of being is\n\u201csubstance,\u201d ambiguously thought in its primary sense as\nthe particular entity (e.g. Socrates) and in its secondary sense the\nuniversal that makes that entity what it is (e.g. human being), and\nthe highest being was thought to be the \u201cunmoved mover.\u201d\nGreek ontology later influenced the Christian theological tradition to\nthink of God as the \u201chighest being,\u201d such that the dual\nthreads of the Western tradition were woven together as what Heidegger\ncalls \u201conto-theology.\u201d Hence, the fundamental\nphilosophical question of the onto-theological mainstream of the West\nis, \u201cWhat is being?\u201d On the other hand, the\ncounter-question which the Kyoto School finds in the East is,\n\u201cWhat is nothingness?\u201d In place of an ontology, first\nphilosophy in the East is more often a \u201cmeontology\u201d: a\nphilosophy of non-being or nothingness.\n\nPerhaps we should say \u201cmu-logy\u201d rather than\n\u201cmeontology\u201d; for, strictly speaking, the Greek\nmeon, \u201cnon-being,\u201d should be translated into\nJapanese as hi-u. What I am translating as\n\u201cnothingnesss,\u201d mu, is written with a single\ncharacter rather than as a negation (hi) of being\n(u). This is crucial since the nothingness with which they\nare concerned is not the simple negation or privation of being. It is\ncloser to what Heidegger means by \u201cbeing.\u201d Attentive to\nwhat he calls the \u201contological difference\u201d between being\n(das Sein) and beings (das Seiende), Heidegger notes\nthat with respect to beings, understood as determinate things, being\ncan only appear as \u201cno-thing.\u201d We fail to attend to the\nno-thing of being when we think only of things, and especially when we\nthink of thinking as a mere calculation of predetermined beings.\nHeidegger thus calls \u201cthe nothing\u201d (das Nichts)\nthe \u201cveil of being.\u201d Being cannot but appear to us as\nnothing, insofar as we know only of beings. Yet it is das\nSein or das Nichts which grants an open place, a\nclearing (Lichtung), for beings to show themselves in the\nfirst place. But this clearing lets beings be by withdrawing itself\nfrom view. Just as \u201cnature (phusis) loves to\nhide\u201d (Heraclitus), being lets determinate beings come to\npresence by withdrawing its indeterminate abundance into absence or\nself-concealment (see Heidegger 1975, Vol. 9, 103\u201322; and Vol.\n65, 246\u201347).\n\nTanabe studied with Heidegger in the early 1920s. (In fact, upon\nreturning to Japan in 1924, Tanabe was the first scholar in the world\nto write an article on Heidegger\u2019s thought.) When he later wrote\nthe following, Tanabe no doubt had Heidegger\u2019s 1929 \u201cWhat\nis Metaphysics?\u201d lecture in mind: \u201cAll science needs to\ntake some entity or other as its object of study. The point of contact\nis always in being, not in nothing. The discipline that has to do with\nnothingness is philosophy\u201d (THZ VI, 156; see Heisig 2001,\n121).\n\nHeidegger was of course not the first Western philosopher to ask after\nthat which is radically other than beings or \u201cbeyond\nbeing\u201d as\n such.[5]\n For example, Tanabe could have also found support for the idea that\nphilosophy investigates nothingness in the following passage from\nHegel: \u201cDas Erste der Philosophie aber ist, das\nabsolute Nichts zu erdenken\u201d [Yet the first task of\nphilosophy is to conceive of absolute nothingness] (quoted\nfrom Hegel\u2019s \u201cGlauben und Wissen\u201d in \u014chashi\n1984, 203). The Kyoto School might even be thought of as recovering a\nsuggestion from one of the first Presocratic philosophers,\nAnaximander: namely, to think finite beings as determinations, or\ndelimitations, of \u201cthe indefinite\u201d or \u201cthe\nunlimited\u201d (to apeiron).\n\nMoreover, as Kyoto School thinkers frequently do point out, Christian\nnegative theologians and mystics, most notably Meister Eckhart, at\ntimes make use of the notion of \u201cthe nothing\u201d to refer to\nthat which transcends all concepts and all oppositions. For Eckhart,\n\u201cnothing\u201d (niht) was one way of indicating the\n\u201cGodhead\u201d (g\u014dtheit) beyond \u201cGod\u201d\ndelimited as a personal being (see Eckehart 1963, 328). Niht\nhere is an expression, at the limits of language, which attempts to\nindicate \u201cthe nothingness of indistinct fullness from which flow\n\u2026 all oppositions and relations\u201d (Sch\u00fcrmann 1978,\n168). Eckhart speaks of a breakthrough, not only beyond the ego, but\nalso beyond God Himself, a breakthrough, that is, to an abyssal\nGodhead understood as \u201cthe silent desert into which no\ndistinction ever gazed, of Father, Son, or Holy Ghost\u201d (Eckehart\n1963, 316). Analogously, Nishida writes that \u201cwhen we truly\nenter thoroughly into the consciousness of absolute nothingness, there\nis neither I nor God\u201d (NKZ V, 182; see Nishida 1958, 137).\n\nNishitani affirms Eckhart\u2019s intimations of a Godhead of absolute\nnothingness, even though he notes that this is \u201cmarkedly distant\nfrom orthodox Christian faith,\u201d which limits the concept of\nnothingness to the relative nothingness expressed in the\nnihilum of creatio ex nihilo, that is, to the\nabsolute privation of being out of which the highest being creates\nlesser beings (NKC X, 75; Nishitani 1982, 66; also see NKC VII). Yet\nNishitani\u2019s student and Eckhart scholar Ueda Shizuteru, despite\nprofound appreciation for Eckhart\u2019s thought and its nearness to\nZen, argues in the end that Eckhart\u2019s nothingness, like that of\nnegative theology in general, still points to an inexpressibly higher\nbeing (see USS VIII, 146). Critically adapting\nHeidegger\u2019s expression, we might say that the nothing is still\nunderstood as \u201cthe veil\u201d of this inexpressibly higher\nbeing. Both Nishitani and Ueda ultimately look to Zen for a\nnothingness so absolute that, in thoroughly negating any traces of\nopposition to beings (i.e., as a higher being transcending worldly\nbeings), it is paradoxically found fully in the concrete facts and\nactivities of the here and now (see USS VIII, 5ff.).\n\n\u014chashi stresses, however, that neither the Buddhist tradition nor\nthe Kyoto School should be thought of as having a patent on the\nradical \u201cthinking of nothingness.\u201d In fact, he argues,\n\u201cthis thought slowly came to the fore within Western philosophy\nitself,\u201d a process that indeed set the stage for Kyoto School\ncontributions to contemporary philosophy (\u014chashi 2004,\n12\u201313). Nishitani had already explored a number of resonant\nnotions of nothingness, not only in the Neoplatonic and Christian\nmystical traditions, but also in 19th and 20th\ncentury Western philosophers such as Nietzsche and Heidegger (see NKC\nVIII; Nishitani 1990). And yet, here again Nishitani finds residues of\nan ontological bias, where a kind of \u201crelative\nnothingness\u201d is posited as either a simple negation of or as a\nveil for being. Nishitani ultimately concludes that Nietzsche\nsucceeded only in expressing a \u201cstandpoint of relative absolute\nnothingness\u201d; and even in Heidegger, he critically suggests,\n\u201ctraces of the representation of nothingness as some\n\u2018thing\u2019 that is nothingness still remain\u201d (NKC X, 75\nand 108; Nishitani 1982, 66 and\n 96).[6]\n\nIn any case, it is fair to say that the Kyoto School thinkers\ngenerally consider the purest sources for the idea of absolute\nnothingness to lie in the traditions of Asia. Hisamatsu went so far as\nto speak of absolute nothingness as \u201coriental nothingness\u201d\n(Hisamatsu 1960); though it is important to bear in mind that his\nclaim is that this idea was first clearly discovered in the\ntraditions of Asia. Absolute nothingness is by no means only relevant\nto Asian cultures, anymore than in 1500 CE the earth was only round in\nthe West. Moreover, if the idea of absolute nothingness\n\u201ccame to awareness in the spirituality of the East,\u201d as\nNishitani says, the philosophy of absolute nothingness is\ngenerally considered to be the Kyoto School\u2019s own contribution\nto the contemporary world of thought opened up by the meeting of\nEastern and Western traditions.\n\nNishida\u2014who could hardly be accused of underestimating what\nJapan had to learn from Western philosophy\u2014also spoke at times\nin very general terms of Eastern nothingness in contrast with Western\nbeing. In his essay, \u201cThe Types of Culture of the Classical\nPeriods of East and West Seen from a Metaphysical Perspective,\u201d\nhe wrote: \u201cHow then are we to distinguish between the types of\nculture of the West and East from a metaphysical point of view? I\nthink we can do this by dividing them into that [i.e., the culture of\nthe West] which considers the ground of reality to be being, and that\n[i.e., the culture of the East] which considers this ground to be\nnothingness.\u201d In Greek philosophy, he goes on to say,\n\u201cthat which has form and determination was regarded as the\nreal\u201d; or even, as in Plato, reality, that which has true being,\nwas understood as the Forms. Judeo-Christian culture, however\nradically different in various ways it was from Greek culture, and\ndespite negative theology\u2019s indications of a Deus\nabsconditus as a kind of nothingness, nevertheless primarily\nconsidered the person of God as \u201cthe most perfect\nbeing\u201d to be the basis of reality. In radical contrast to both\nthe Greek and Judeo-Christian origins of Western culture, Indian\nculture, like that of China and Japan, took \u201cthe profoundest\nidea of nothingness as its basis\u201d (NKZ VII, 429\u201333; see\nNishida 1970, 237\u201340).\n\nIn the closing lines of the preface to his 1926 book, From That\nWhich Acts to That Which Sees, a book many scholars view as the\nbeginning of \u201cNishida Philosophy\u201d proper, we find the\nfollowing famous and programmatic lines: \u201cIt goes without saying\nthat there is much to admire, and much to learn from, in the\nimpressive achievements of Western culture, which thought form as\nbeing and the giving of form as good. However, does there not lie\nhidden at the base of our Eastern culture, preserved and passed down\nby our ancestors for several thousand years, something which sees the\nform of the formless and hears the voice of the voiceless? Our hearts\nand minds endlessly seek this something; and it is my wish to provide\nthis quest with a philosophical foundation\u201d (NKZ IV, 6).\n3.2 The Buddhist and Daoist Background for the Idea of Absolute Nothingness\n\nBefore looking more specifically at how Nishida and other members of\nthe Kyoto School attempt to give philosophical form to the formless,\nit will be helpful to look at some of the threads in Eastern\ntraditions on which the Kyoto School thinkers are explicitly and\nimplicitly drawing as they weave their texts on absolute\nnothingness.\n\nTheir explicit references are primarily to Mah\u0101y\u0101na\nBuddhism, especially to the East Asian Buddhist schools of Zen\n(predominantly the Rinzai tradition but also notably D\u014dgen of\nS\u014dt\u014d) and Pure Land (predominantly Shinran\u2019s Shin)\nBuddhism. The key Sanskrit term in Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism here is\n\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101 (\u201cemptiness\u201d;\nk\u016b in Japanese). With the noteworthy exception of the\nlater Nishitani, however, the Kyoto School tends to favor the Chinese\nglyph mu (\u201cnothingness\u201d; wu in Chinese),\nwhich is found predominantly in Zen, and which reflects the early\nattempt to \u201cmatch terms\u201d with Daoism in the translation\nand interpretive development of Buddhism in China. Let us briefly\nexamine both of these Asian sources for the Kyoto School\u2019s\nphilosophies of absolute nothingness, \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101\nand\n wu/mu.[7]\n\nIn Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101 refers\nfirst of all to the fact that all things come into being in\n\u201cinterdependent origination\u201d (Sanskrit:\nprat\u012btya-samutp\u0101da; Japanese: engi), and\nthey are therefore \u201cempty\u201d of any independent substantial\nself-nature or \u201cown-being\u201d (Sanskrit:\nsvabh\u0101va). This thought is closely tied to the basic\nBuddhist thesis of \u201cno-ego\u201d (Sanskrit:\nan\u0101tman; Japanese: muga). All beings, including\nthe ego, are interconnected and in flux. Psychologically,\n\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101 refers also to the releasement from\nall attachment to beings, from all reification and willful\nappropriation of them. Such attachments are both based on and in turn\nsupport the primary attachment to the fabricated ego, since the ego\nboth strives to possess and is unwittingly possessed by its\nreification of beings. To awaken to the emptiness of all things, to\ntheir lack of substantial own-being or egoity (Japanese:\nshogy\u014dmuga), therefore, is to free oneself from both an\nego-centered and reified view of things as well as from the illusion\nof the substantial ego itself.\n\nYet, if the movement of negation stops here at a one-sided negation of\nbeing (i.e., at negation of the illusory independent substantial\nreality of things and the ego), then the idea of\n\u201cemptiness\u201d is not itself\n emptied.[8]\n That would leave us with either a pessimistic nihilism or,\nironically, a reified view of emptiness itself. These are what the\nBuddhist tradition calls \u201cemptiness-sickness\u201d (Japanese:\nk\u016bby\u014d). True emptiness must be understood to\ndynamically negate the very opposition of being and (relative)\nnothingness (see Nakamura 1975, Vol. 1, 278). Hence, in\nMah\u0101y\u0101na we find an explicit return\u2014through a\n\u201cgreat negation\u201d of a reified misunderstanding of\nbeing\u2014to a \u201cgreat affirmation\u201d of a non-reified\nunderstanding of being. Emptiness thoroughly understood is nothing\nseparate from or opposed to \u201cbeing\u201d properly understood.\nAs the often chanted lines of the Heart Sutra put it:\n\u201c[phenomenal] form is emptiness; emptiness is also [phenomenal]\nform; emptiness is no other than form; form is no other than\nemptiness\u201d (see Bercholz & Kohn 1993, 155). The famous\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist philosopher of\n\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101 N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (ca. 150\u2013250\nCE) went so far as to provocatively state: \u201cThe limits (i.e.,\nrealm) of nirv\u0101na are the limits of\nsams\u0101ra. Between the two, also, there is not the\nslightest difference whatsoever\u201d (Inada 1993, 158). In other\nwords, nirv\u0101na is neither a nihilistic extinction of nor\na transcendent escape from the phenomenal world\n(sams\u0101ra); it is rather an enlightened manner of\nbeing-in-the-world here and now (see Garfield 1995, 332). This radical\nreaffirmation of the phenomenal world was particularly stressed in\nEast Asian developments of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, where we find\nsuch remarkably affirmative phrases as: \u201ctrue emptiness,\nmarvelous being\u201d (Japanese: shink\u016b-my\u014du).\n\nEven though he never disavows the term Nishida coined, \u201cabsolute\nnothingness\u201d (zettai-mu), in his mature writings\nNishitani explicitly employs the Mah\u0101y\u0101na term\n\u201cemptiness\u201d (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101,\nk\u016b) in his attempt to think a way beyond both the\nexacerbated attachment to being and the reactive nihilism that\ntogether plague the modern world (see Ueda 2011a). Nishitani writes as\nfollows: On the one hand, emptiness can be termed \u201can absolute\nnegativity, inasmuch as it is a standpoint that has negated and\nthereby transcended nihility, which was itself the\ntranscendence-through-negation of all being.\u201d In this sense,\n\u201cemptiness can well be described as \u2018outside\u2019 of and\nabsolutely \u2018other\u2019 than the standpoint shackled to being,\nprovided we avoid the misconception that emptiness is some\n\u2018thing\u2019 distinct from being and subsisting\n\u2018outside\u2019 it.\u201d On the other hand, then, emptiness is\ntruly emptiness \u201conly when it empties itself even of the\nstandpoint that represents it as some \u2018thing\u2019 that is\nemptiness. \u2026 [True emptiness] is to be realized as something\nunited to and self-identical with being\u201d (NKC X, 109\u201310;\nNishitani 1982, 97). Following in the wake of Nishida\u2019s\ntopological thinking of absolute nothingness (see subsection 3.3\nbelow), Nishitani also thinks of emptiness as a \u201cplace\u201d or\n\u201cfield\u201d (ba) wherein beings can appear as they\ntruly are in their proper basis or \u201chome-ground\u201d\n(moto).\n\nThe idea of a nothingness that radically transcends, or underlies,\nboth being and its simple negation can also be traced back to\npre-Buddhist Chinese thought. A Chinese scholar laments the\nphilosophical ambiguity inherent in the Chinese character wu\n(nothingness). He writes that \u201cin Chinese\n\u2018wu\u2019 can mean both the contrasting pair of\n\u2018you\u2019 [i.e., \u2018being\u2019] and the\nmetaphysical source of both \u2018you\u2019 and\n\u2018wu\u2019\u201d (Zhang 2002, 150). In the terminology\nof the Kyoto School, the former sense of wu (mu in\nJapanese) is a matter of \u201crelative nothingness,\u201d while the\nlatter sense is akin to what they call \u201cabsolute\nnothingness.\u201d The latter sense of wu is expressed in\nchapter 40 of the Daodejing as follows: \u201cThe myriad\nthings under heaven are generated from being. Being is generated from\nnothingness (wu).\u201d This unnamable non-dualistic source\nof all being and relative non-being is also referred to as the Way\n(dao). Of the latter it is said, in chapter 14 of the\nDaodejing: \u201cIt is called the shapeless shape, the image\nof no-thing\u201d (see Izutsu 2001, 50\u201351 and 104). It is not\nhard to link this thought with Nishida\u2019s professed intention of\ngiving philosophical foundation to the \u201cform of the\nformless\u201d that he maintained lies at the heart of the traditions\nof the East.\n\nIn the Daoist tradition we also find an idea of nothingness used in\nthe context of radically emptying the mind in order to attune the\nfinite self to the\n in-finite[9]\n rhythm of the Way. The Zhuangzi speaks in this regard of the\npractice of \u201csitting down and forgetting everything\u201d and\nof \u201cbeing empty like a mirror\u201d (see Watson 1968, 90 and\n97). When Zen talks of returning to one\u2019s \u201coriginal face\nbefore one\u2019s parents were born,\u201d we find the Daoist ideas\nof \u201cforgetting the ego\u201d and \u201creturning to the\nroot\u201d combined with the Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist notion of\nthe \u201coriginal purity of the mind.\u201d The original brightness\nand purity of the mind, which lies hidden beneath the clouds of\ndefiling passion, is also frequently expressed in Mah\u0101y\u0101na\ntexts with the analogy of a mirror that is able to spontaneously\nreflect the world without egoistic discriminations.\n\nZen presumably inherits this analogy of the original mind as mirror\nfrom both Mah\u0101y\u0101na and Daoist sources. In the traditional\nedition of The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch,\nhowever, all residues of dualistic discrimination\u2014including\nthose that remain even in the notion of a mirror that needs to be\ncontinually wiped clean of impurities\u2014are swept away in the\nfamous lines: \u201cOriginally there is not a single thing\u201d\n(Chinese: benlai wu-yi-wu; Japanese: honrai\nmu-ichi-motsu). In this quintessential Zen expression are wedded\ntogether the meontological and psychological senses of\nwu/mu: a rejection of an ontology of independent\nsubstances, a declaration of an originary (self-negating) nothingness,\nand an expression of a radical freedom from egoistic attachment as\nwell as freedom for spontaneous creativity and compassion.\n\nIn Zen we find the Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist notion of emptiness and\nthe Daoist notion of nothingness fully intertwined and developed into\na practice of living both completely unattached and completely engaged\nin the world of \u201ctrue emptiness, marvelous being.\u201d In the\nfamous wu or mu k\u014dan that opens the\nGateless Barrier, Wumen (Mumon) urges those who wish to reach\nenlightenment, that is, those who wish to pass through the\n\u201cbarrier of the gate of nothingness,\u201d to concentrate their\nentire life force on this wu (mu), taking care to\nunderstand it neither as \u201cnihilistic nothingness\u201d nor\n\u201cin terms of being and non-being\u201d (Nishimura 1994, 22; see\nCleary 1999, 71). This was the k\u014dan that Nishida finally passed\nafter nearly a decade of intense practice of Zen (see Yusa 2002,\n45ff.). And as Nishida confided many years later to Nishitani, it was\nfrom early on his \u201cimpossible desire\u201d to somehow bring Zen\nand philosophy together (NKZ XIX, 224\u201325). Even more than did\nNishida, several subsequent Kyoto School philosophers, most notably\nNishitani, Hisamatsu, Abe, and Ueda, explicitly endeavored to bring\nthe practice as well as the thought of Zen into relation with\nphilosophy (see Davis 2021; 2022, 275\u201389).\n3.3 Nishida\u2019s Topology of Absolute Nothingness\n\nBesides contrasting Western being with Eastern nothingness, in his\nlater writings Nishida also at times makes a broad distinction between\na Western \u201clogic of things\u201d and an Eastern \u201clogic of\nthe heart-mind (kokoro).\u201d While Western thought tends\nto begin with an objective logic of substances (be these physical or\nmental), he claims that in Buddhism one can find the germ of a logic\nof the heart-mind, even if traditionally this remained largely at the\nlevel of an expression of personal experience rather than being fully\ndeveloped into a genuinely philosophical logic (see Nishida 1964,\n356). Scholars of Buddhism may object that it was Nishida\u2019s own\nknowledge of Buddhism that remained too much at the level of personal\nexperience, rather than the sophisticated discourses of Abhidharma,\nM\u0101dhyamaka, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra, Tiantai, and Huayan traditions of\nBuddhist philosophy themselves.\n\nIn any case, in the development of Nishida\u2019s thought,\n\u201cbeing\u201d is thought of in terms of the objectivity of\ndeterminate things, \u201crelative nothingness\u201d is understood\nas a mere privation or simple negation of being, and an enveloping\nsense of \u201cnothingness\u201d is provisionally associated with a\nkind of transcendental subjectivity of consciousness or the\nheart-mind. Ultimately, however, Nishida comes to posit absolute\nnothingness as the \u201cplace\u201d (basho) that embraces\nboth subjective (noetic) and objective (noematic) dimensions\nof reality. Thus, he relegates not only privation of being but also\nsubjective nothingness, in the sense of the \u201cfield of\nconsciousness,\u201d to a type of \u201crelative\n nothingness.\u201d[10]\n\nIn 1934 Nishida writes: \u201cReality is being and at the same time\nnothingness; it is being-and-nothingness [u-soku-mu],\nnothingness-and-being; it is both subjective and objective, noetic and\nnoematic. Reality is the unity of subjectivity and objectivity, and\nthus the self-identity of what is absolutely contradictory. Or rather,\nit is not that [the separate spheres of] subjectivity and objectivity\ncome to unite, and then we first have reality. [The opposition of]\nsubjectivity and objectivity must instead be thought from out of a\ndynamically dialectical reality that is self-determining\u201d (NKZ\nVII, 441; see Nishida 1970, 29). Reality, as the dialectical\n\u201cself-determination of absolute nothingness,\u201d is in\nNishida\u2019s later works understood as a dynamic \u201cidentity of\nthe absolute contradiction\u201d between subjective (relative)\nnothingness and objective being. Absolute nothingness is the temporal\nand spatial \u201cplace\u201d wherein individual persons and things\ndetermine one another in their mutual interactions.\n\nThe \u201cplace of absolute nothingess\u201d (zettai-mu no\nbasho) first became the central concept of Nishida\u2019s\nthought in the mid-1920s, though he continued to develop and rethink\nthe idea up until his last completed essay in 1945, \u201cThe Logic\nof Place and the Religious Worldview.\u201d Nishida first explicitly\nworked out an idea of absolute nothingness in his 1926 book, From\nThat Which Acts to That Which Sees (NKZ IV), a book which\ninaugurated his middle-period of thought. In this work, which includes\nan important essay entitled \u201cPlace\u201d\n(\u201cBasho\u201d), Nishida\u2019s topological reasoning\ndevelops in rough outline as\n follows[11]:\n\nJust as all events must \u201ctake place\u201d somewhere, all beings\nmust be situated in some place. Beings always exist in relation to\nother beings, and any relation requires a third term, namely, the\nplace or medium wherein they are related. In other words, for A and B\nto be related, there must be some place, C, in which their relation is\nsituated. To begin with, we can understand this C as the spatial\n\u201ccontext\u201d in which objects are situated in relation to one\nanother. But the context in which things are defined is more than\nspatial; a thing is not only here as opposed to there. Things are\ndetermined according to a number of criteria, each of which operates\nwithin its own field of judgment. Hence, the place C can be further\nunderstood as a \u201ccategory\u201d of judgment, such as the\nquality \u201ccolor.\u201d Red and blue are revealed, and contrasted\nwith one another, as colors within the same color field.\n\nIn order to let concrete things reveal themselves yet more fully,\nhowever, we should think of C as \u201cconsciousness.\u201d Our\nminds are able to correlate various categories of judgment, such as\ncolor, size, shape, location, etc., and therefore to perceive\nindividual things as composed of unique combinations of various\nqualities and relations. For example, we are conscious of a certain\nthing as a round, soft, red, sweet, apple sitting on a table. The\nfield of consciousness is the field in which these different\ncategories are unified in the perception and judgment of the qualities\nof a particular thing in relation to other particular things and their\nqualities.\n\nUltimately, however, there is a crucial limit to the subjective\n\u201cfield of consciousness.\u201d As Kant demonstrated, subjective\nconsciousness cannot reflect things as they are in themselves, but\nonly as they appear when schematized according to subjective\ncategories. What, then, is the ultimate place wherein the encounter\nbetween subjects and objects takes place, wherein persons and things\ncoexist? According to Nishida, this must be the place wherein persons\nand things not only undergo changes in accidental categorical\nqualities, but wherein they essentially and existentially \u201ccome\nto be and pass away.\u201d It is the place, not just of intellectual\njudgments, but of birth and death. This ultimate \u201cgroundless\nground,\u201d which \u201cenvelops\u201d all beings, yet which does\nso in such a way that lets them contain their own principle of\nself-determination, Nishida calls \u201cthe place of true\nnothingness.\u201d Although in no sense a determinate being, neither\nis this place of true or absolute nothingness a mere static vacuity.\nIt must be thought of as both the epistemic source of consciousness\nand the ontological origin of beings.\n\nAlthough Nishida comes to the idea of the place of absolute\nnothingness most directly through his confrontations with Kant and\nNeo-Kantianism, he does not shy from thinking this place in\nmetaphysical as well as epistemological terms: nothingness is not\nmerely a reflective, but is also a creative principle (NKZ IV,\n238\u201339). As he writes much later, \u201cabsolute nothingness at\nonce transcends everything and is that by which everything is\nconstituted\u201d (NKZ IX, 6). And yet, Nishida repeatedly tells us\nthat, as no-thing outside of or other than the place of the coming to\nbe and passing away of truly individual beings, absolute nothingness\nis not to be thought of as a \u201ctranscendent\nbeing.\u201d Nor is it to be understood as the processional unfolding\nof a \u201cpotential being,\u201d that is to say, as a kind of\nHegelian \u201cworld Spirit\u201d with its own cunning reason at\nwork behind the scenes of its historical march toward\nself-realization. The absolute, according to Nishida, must be thought\nof as nothingness in order to distinguish it from all ontologies that\nwould reduce the uniqueness and autonomy of truly individual beings\neither to a transcendent being or to an underlying mechanical or\nteleological process.\n\nOne of the driving concerns behind Nishida\u2019s repeated insistence\nthat the absolute be thought of in the meontological terms of a\nformless, indeterminate place of absolute nothingness, is that only\ntherein can self-determining and irreducibly singular individuals be\ngiven their due. All ontologies of universal being fail to allow for\nthe existence of the \u201ctrue individual,\u201d or for the genuine\nencounter between such individuals. Since \u201cthere is no universal\n[of being] whatsoever that subsumes the I and the thou\u201d (NKZ VI,\n381), the locus of genuine interpersonal encounter must be thought of\nin terms of the place of absolute nothingness (see Davis 2014).\n\nIt should be pointed out that the Japanese term for\n\u201cabsolute,\u201d zettai, literally means a\n\u201csevering of opposition,\u201d which implies the sense of\n\u201cwithout an opposing other.\u201d The contrasting term is\ns\u014dtai, which indicates \u201crelativity\u201d in the\nliteral sense of \u201cmutual opposition.\u201d The true absolute\nmust embrace, rather than stand over against, the relative. The\nabsolute, therefore, must not oppose itself to relative beings;\nrather, its self-determination must be such as to allow their mutually\nautonomous relations to take place. According to Nishida, it is only a\nphilosophy of the place of absolute nothingness that can do justice to\nthe notion of the absolute as well as account for both the autonomy\nand the mutual relativity of individuals.\n\nWhile on the one hand Nishida becomes increasingly concerned with\nallowing for radical interpersonal alterity within the place of\nabsolute nothingness, on the other hand he also consistently argues\nfrom early on that \u201cconsciousness\u201d should not be thought\nto entail an unbridgeable epistemological subject-object split.\nAlthough he initially adopted, and adapted, the notion of \u201cpure\nexperience\u201d from William James and others to express this\nnondual basis of knowledge (see Nishida 1990), Nishida later drops\nthis expression in favor of the notion of \u201cself-awareness\u201d\n(jikaku). According to Nishida, self-awareness can be defined\nas a \u201cself reflecting itself within itself\u201d (NKZ IV,\n 215).[12]\n Since absolute nothingness is not a \u201cself\u201d in the sense\nof a subject standing over against an object, any more than it is an\nego with its own interested categories of perception, the\nself-awareness of absolute nothingness must be that of a \u201cseeing\nwithout a seer\u201d or a \u201cknowing without a knower.\u201d\n\u201cSince there is no-thing that reflects, it is like a mirror\nreflecting the mirror itself\u201d (ibid., 181).\n\nIn Nishida\u2019s middle period, the paradigm for knowing is a\n\u201cpure seeing\u201d (tada miru) beyond all acting and\nvolition. Nishida claims that as finite individuals we can approach\nthis ideal by way of thoroughly negating or emptying the ego.\n\u201cBy truly emptying the self, the field of consciousness can\nreflect an object just as it is\u201d (NKZ IV, 221). The self reaches\nthe place of absolute nothingness, and therefore first truly comes\ninto contact with other beings, by way of thoroughly emptying itself\nin a movement of \u201cimmanent transcendence\u201d that takes it\nback through the depths of the field of consciousness.\n\nIn his last completed text, \u201cThe Logic of Place and the\nReligious Worldview,\u201d Nishida most fully develops the religious\nimplications of the idea of absolute nothingness. There he suggests\nthat absolute nothingness is the best way to understand God or the\nabsolute, which he defines as that which \u201ccontains its own\nabsolute self-negation within itself\u201d (NKZ XI, 397). As absolute\nnothingness, God is the dynamic principle of affirmation by way of\nabsolute self-negation. The true absolute essentially negates its\ntranscendent divinity and expresses itself in the forms of the\n relative.[13]\n\nNishida insists that this idea of God can be understood no more in\nterms of an immanent pantheism than in terms of a transcendent theism.\nIt may perhaps best be called \u201cpanentheism\u201d; but for\nNishida this too remains a static term of \u201cobjective\nlogic\u201d and fails to capture the necessity of thinking God as\nboth irreducibly transcendent and thoroughly immanent. As\nNishida is fond of saying, God or the Buddha is \u201cimmanently\ntranscendent.\u201d It is the paradoxical logic one finds in the\nPraj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 Sutras of\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism (i.e., what D. T. Suzuki called the\n\u201clogic of soku-hi,\u201d a logic of \u201cis and is\nnot\u201d) that Nishida thinks most profoundly expresses the\n\u201cabsolute dialectic\u201d of the divine as the dynamic\nprinciple of absolute nothingness (NKZ XI, 399; see Nishida 1987,\n69\u201371).\n\nIf we as finite relative beings can and do touch the infinite\nabsolute, it is only by way of a mutual self-negation. Nishida calls\nthis mutual self-negation \u201cinverse correspondence\u201d\n(gyakutai\u014d). By way of radically emptying ourselves, we\ncan touch that which is the radical origin of self-emptying, the\nabsolute as an essentially self-negating absolute nothingness.\nAccording to Nishida, an immanent principle of self-negation is, in\nfact, the very essence of life. \u201cTrue life (seimei)\nmust contain within itself an absolute nothingness, a [principle of]\nabsolute negation\u201d (NKZ VIII, 341). It is such a life that can\ntruly be self-determining as a \u201ccreative element of a creative\nworld.\u201d\n\nIn his middle period, inaugurated by the first formulations of the\nidea of \u201cthe place of absolute nothingness\u201d in From\nThat Which Acts to That Which Sees, Nishida\u2019s thought was\ncharacterized by a shift from his earlier voluntarism to a kind of\nintuitionism of pure seeing without a seer (see NKZ IV, 3\u20136). In\nhis later period, however, Nishida\u2019s epistemology became much\nmore dynamic and dialectical; rather than \u201cpure seeing,\u201d\nhis key epistemological phrase then became\n\u201caction-intuition\u201d (k\u014di-teki chokkan).\nAlthough self-emptying still plays a vital role, this is understood\nnot as preparation for a passive intuition, but rather as an active\nprocess of \u201cseeing a thing by becoming it.\u201d In other\nwords, intuition happens only in the midst of the dialectical process\nof acting upon and in turn being acted upon by things.\n\nIn his later period, the place of absolute nothingness is accordingly\nreconceived much more dynamically as the \u201cself-determination of\nthe dialectical world,\u201d a world which continually moves\naccording to the principle of \u201cfrom created to creating.\u201d\nThe absolute finds expression only in the midst of the mutual\ninteraction of individuals and things, and true individuals are both\ndetermined by and \u201ccounter-determine\u201d (gyaku-gentei\nsuru) the movement of the dialectical world (see NKZ VII, 305ff.;\nVIII, 313\u201314). Although one can trace an immanent unfolding of\nNishida\u2019s thought in this direction, it is also clear that a\nmajor impetus for his dialectical development of the idea of absolute\nnothingness can be found in the criticism he received from his junior\ncolleague, Tanabe Hajime.\n3.4 Tanabe\u2019s Absolute Nothingness as the Other-Power of Absolute Mediation\n\nIt is Tanabe\u2019s declaration of partial independence from\nNishida\u2019s thought in an essay written in 1930, \u201cRequesting\nInstruction from Professor Nishida\u201d (THZ IV, 305\u2013328),\nthat many see as the origin of the Kyoto School as more than a group\nof disciples of \u201cNishida Philosophy.\u201d In this essay Tanabe\nsharply criticizes Nishida\u2019s middle-period philosophy of the\n\u201cplace of absolute nothingness,\u201d claiming that it falls\ninto kind of Plotinian \u201cemanationism\u201d that ultimately\nrests on a religious or mystical intuition. For Tanabe, this posed two\nserious problems for a genuine philosophy of absolute nothingness.\n\nTo begin with, in crossing the line between philosophical reason,\nbased on ordinary experience, and supra-rational intuition, based on\nextra-ordinary religious experience, Nishida had purportedly committed\na methodological transgression. Here Tanabe poses a question that\nstill resounds through (some would say haunts) the halls of Kyoto\nSchool studies to this day. As James Heisig puts it, the Kyoto School\nthinkers in general do not share an important assumption of Western\nphilosophy as a whole, namely, a \u201cclear delineation between\nphilosophy and religion\u201d (Heisig 2001, 13\u201314). This is a\ncomplex issue, since the Western concept of \u201creligion\u201d was\njust as much an import to Japan as was \u201cphilosophy.\u201d The\nproblems faced and the possibilities opened up by a Zen Buddhist\n\u201cphilosophy of religion\u201d in particular differ in\nsignificant ways from a Judeo-Christian one, insofar as the former\ncalls for extending rational thought in the direction of a\n\u201cpractice of awakening\u201d rather than in the direction of a\nleap of faith.\n\nThe provocative methodological issues involved in the relation between\nthe philosophical thinking and the Zen practice of some Kyoto School\nphilosophers deserves greater attention than can be given here (see\nDavis 2021; 2022a, 275\u2013289). Let it suffice to point out here\nthat Tanabe too later crisscrosses the line between philosophy and\nreligion as much as any Kyoto School thinker, although his Shin\nBuddhist inclinations took him in the direction of \u201cfaith\u201d\nrather than\n \u201cintuition.\u201d[14]\n After this religious turn in his thinking, Tanabe claimed that\nphilosophy and faith must be mediated by a personal act of metanoesis\n(Tanabe 2000, 34; Tanabe 1986, 29) and that, in order to develop a\ngenuine philosophy of religion, \u201cin the end one must have faith\nand become self-aware by means of religious faith\u201d (Tanabe 2003,\n27).\n\nFor his part, Nishida responded to Tanabe\u2019s early critique by\naffirming that his idea of the self-awareness of absolute nothingness\ndoes indeed entail the profound significance of religious experience.\nYet he claims that this is neither mystical in the sense of\n\u201creligious ecstasy\u201d nor \u201cis it thought in the\ndirection of substance, as is Plotinus\u2019 One.\u201d He denies\nthe charge of emanationism, claiming that in his thought \u201cit is\nnot a matter of the self-determination of being, but rather the\nself-determination of nothingness\u201d (NKZ VI, 154). For Nishida,\nonly if the absolute is thought in terms of a self-negating\nnothingness, rather than in terms of a transcendent plenum of the One,\nis it possible to truly affirm the world of the many. The absolute is\nfound in the very midst of beings, not beyond them. It is\n\u201cbecause this is absolute nothingness,\u201d Nishida writes in\nthe parlance of Zen, \u201cthat the mountain is mountain, the river\nis river, and all beings are just as they are\u201d (NKZ V, 182; see\nNishida 1958, 137).\n\nBut the other major concern of Tanabe\u2019s critique of Nishida was\nthat, insofar as absolute nothingness is made into an unchanging basis\nor enveloping \u201cplace\u201d of a system of reality, and insofar\nas it is seen as transcending the dialectical interactions among\nbeings, then such a philosophy ends up falling back into a metaphysics\nof being after all. In order to radically think the idea of absolute\nnothingness, Tanabe argues, we must conceive of it rather in terms of\n\u201cabsolute mediation\u201d or \u201cabsolute dialectic.\u201d\nAbsolute nothingness must be thought, not as an enveloping place, but\nas the very movement of \u201cabsolute negation,\u201d a movement\nwhich originates in the self-negation of absolute nothingness itself.\nTanabe writes: \u201cSince the absolute, as nothingness, must act as\nan absolute mediating force, it presupposes relative being as its\nmedium. In contrast with the doctrine of the creation of the world\nmaintained by the theist, or the theory of emanation propounded by the\npantheist, [for] historical thinking the absolute and the relative,\nnothingness and being, are interrelated each with the other as\nindispensable elements of absolute mediation\u201d (Tanabe 2000, 27;\nTanabe 1986, 23).\n\nIn this later text, Philosophy as Metanoetics, written around\nthe same time as Nishida was elaborating his own kenotic idea of a\nself-negating absolute nothingness, Tanabe, in a putative critique of\nNishida, also writes: \u201cBecause the absolute subject of\nOther-power is absolute nothingness \u2026 it must be thoroughly\nmediated by the relative self. In contrast to a mere\n\u2018self-identity of absolute contradictories\u2019, only that\nwhich entails the absolute existential mediation of the death and\nresurrection of the self can be called absolute nothingness\u201d\n(Tanabe 2000, 13; Tanabe 1986, 8). Tanabe\u2019s passing dismissal of\nNishida\u2019s terminology here is hardly convincing, since in fact\nNishida too speaks of the absolute self-negation of absolute\nnothingness and of the existential death and resurrection of the\nfinite self. In any case, Tanabe\u2019s philosophy as the \u201cway\nof metanoetics\u201d (zanged\u014d) entails a ceaseless\nmovement of what he calls \u201cabsolute critique,\u201d where the\nself-power of finite reason again and again runs up against\nantinomies, and is reborn only by way of absolute nothingness as what\nhe calls, in the parlance of Shinran\u2019s Shin Buddhism, the\nworkings of Other-power (tariki).\n\nAs Nishitani and others have pointed out (see NKC IX, 212ff.;\nNishitani 1991, 161ff.), Tanabe\u2019s criticisms often fail to do\njustice to Nishida\u2019s thought, and we should not forget the\nimpetuses Tanabe acknowledges having received from his erstwhile\nmentor. Yet, on the other hand, his criticisms were not without their\npoint, and his provocations certainly did serve as counter-impetuses\nthat spurred Nishida on, not just to clarify, but also to further\ndevelop his philosophy of absolute nothingness (see Sugimoto 2011;\nKopf 2004). No doubt in large part due to the persistent attention\ngiven by Tanabe\u2019s \u201clogic of the specific\u201d to the\nhistorical world, to the irrational element of the specific through\nwhich the individual and the universal must be mediated, and to the\ndialectical relations between finite beings, Nishida gradually moved\ntoward a much more dynamic conception of absolute nothingness as the\nself-determination of the dialectical world, a self-determination\nwhich takes place only by way of the mutual interactions between\nindividual persons, things, and their social-historical contexts.\n3.5 Nishitani\u2019s Three-field Topology: Being, Nihility, and Emptiness\n\nIn the tradition of the Kyoto School, Tanabe\u2019s role has often\nbeen seen, justly or unjustly, as more of a dialectical counterpoint\nthan an independent alternative to Nishida. Following the lead of\nNishida\u2019s own creative appropriation of Tanabe\u2019s critique\nof his middle-period philosophy of place, many subsequent Kyoto School\nfigures have tended to incorporate Tanabe\u2019s dialectical thinking\ninto, rather than seeing it as a replacement for, Nishida\u2019s\ntopological thinking of absolute nothingness. To be sure, such\nthinkers as Takeuchi Yoshinori and Hase Sh\u014dt\u014d were\nprofoundly influenced by Tanabe who, inspired by Shin Buddhism,\nunderstands absolute nothingness in terms of the absolute mediation of\nOther-power. Yet many others received their primary impetus from\nNishida and from Zen. Although Nishida\u2019s conception of a kenotic\nand dialectical self-determination of the place of absolute\nnothingness was inspired by Shin Buddhism and Christianity as well as\nZen Buddhism, later Kyoto philosophers such as Nishitani, Abe, and\nUeda relates their thought primarily to Zen even as they also\ncontinued to engage in dialogue with Shin Buddhism and Christian\ntheology and mysticism.\n\nTanabe\u2019s method of thinking, as we have seen, was intensely\ndialectical, a method he developed through his prolonged study of\nHegel. Nishitani, on the other hand, began his study of Western\nthought by focusing on Bergson, Schelling, Nietzsche and the German\nmystics. Between 1937 and 1939 Nishitani studied with Heidegger, who\nwas at the time beginning to grapple with the question of nihilism,\nand whose phenomenology had developed into a thinking of the\n\u201cclearing of being\u201d or what he would later characterize as\na \u201ctopology of being\u201d (Heidegger 1975, Vol. 15, 335).\nInfluenced no doubt in part by his contact with Heidegger (and\nevidently in turn influencing Heidegger, who frequently invited him to\nhis house to learn about Zen), Nishitani developed, in his own highly\noriginal manner, existential and phenomenological aspects of\nNishida\u2019s topology of absolute nothingness.\n\nThe problem of nihilism gradually became a major focus of\nNishitani\u2019s personal and scholarly attention. Nishitani\nunderstood the historical phenomenon of nihilism as a vacuous\nnothingness that assaults the modern world, a world bereft of its\nethical and religious moorings. Despite Nishitani\u2019s appreciation\nof the profundity of his mentor Nishida\u2019s philosophy, he thought\nit failed to adequately address this crucial modern problem (see Ueda\n2011a). According to Nishitani, Nishida\u2019s philosophy, whether it\nbe his early thought of \u201cpure experience\u201d or his later\nnotion of \u201caction-intuition,\u201d begins already from a\nstandpoint where the dualistic consciousness of the ego has already\nbeen broken though (see NKC IX 247\u201348; Nishitani 1991,\n184\u201385). For his part, Nishitani was concerned with the question\nof how to think the topological pathway leading to such a breakthrough\nto non-duality.\n\nThe question of how to open up an existential path to the place of\nabsolute nothingness was particularly acute given the prevalence of\nthe pendulum swing between two extremes endemic to modernity: on the\none hand, an extreme reification of the subjective ego together with a\ncorresponding objectification and technological manipulation of\nthings; and, on the other hand, a reactive nihilism which threatens to\nnullify the very reality of both the self and things. For Nishitani,\nhumanism and science were incapable of overcoming this dilemma of\nreification vs. nullification; in fact, they had helped create it. In\nan age of secular egoism and anti-religious nihilism, how could an\nexperience of the place of absolute nothingness take place?\n\nTo begin with, Nishitani says we must heed the call of\nNietzsche\u2019s madman and cease fleeing from the experience of\nnihilism. God as the highest being is dead, and it remains an open\nquestion whether he can be reborn as absolute nothingness. In any\ncase, the venture of Nishitani\u2019s philosophy of Zen is more\nconcerned with the existential imperative of letting go of attachments\nthan it is with immediately grasping hold of a new concept for God. In\norder to finally free humans from their egoistic obsessions and\nmanipulative objectifications in the dualistic \u201cfield of\n[reified] being and [dualistic] consciousness,\u201d Nishitani argued\nfor the necessity of first boldly stepping back into the \u201cfield\nof nihility.\u201d\n\nYet the real breakthrough to a non-dualistic reaffirmation of self and\nworld only occurs when the relative nothingness of nihility is in turn\nbroken through to a genuine experience of absolute nothingness or true\nemptiness on the \u201cfield of emptiness.\u201d Nishitani thus\nexplained the personal encounter with nihilism as an experience of the\nextreme relative nothingness of \u201cnihility\u201d or\n\u201cvacuous nothingness\u201d (kyomu), and for him the\ncentral task of \u201covercoming nihilism by way of passing through\nnihilism\u201d entailed transgressing beneath (i.e.,\n\u201ctrans-descending\u201d) the \u201cfield of nihility\u201d to\nthe \u201cfield of emptiness\u201d (see NKC X, 109 and 122ff.;\nNishitani 1986, 97 and\n 108ff.).[15]\n As mentioned earlier (subsection 3.2), the \u201cfield of\nemptiness\u201d is not a vacuum of relative nothingness that assaults\nbeings from without; it is an open clearing wherein beings are neither\nnullified nor reified but rather let be in the mutual freedom of their\ncoming to be and passing away in unobstructed interrelation with one\nanother. It is also the place in which a genuine interpersonal\nencounter can take place (Nishitani 2004; Davis 2017).\n\nWhile Nishitani\u2019s \u201cfield of emptiness\u201d (k\u016b\nno ba) corresponds in many respects to what Nishida\ncalls the \u201cplace of absolute nothingness\u201d (zettai-mu\nno basho), Nishitani takes the peculiar problems that beset the\nmodern secular and technological world, as well as postmodern\ncritiques of metaphysics and subjectivity (especially those of\nNietzsche and Heidegger), far more seriously than did Nishida.\nNishitani also connects his thought much more explicitly with the\ntradition of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism than did Nishida, writing on,\nand writing from, what he calls the \u201cstandpoint of Zen\u201d\n(see NKC XI; and Nishitani 2009).\n3.6 Ueda\u2019s Two-layered World: Linguistic Horizons within the Empty-Expanse\n\nUeda Shizuteru was a student of Nishitani\u2019s who became a\nrenowned Eckhart scholar as well as a scholar and lay master of Zen\n(see M\u00fcller et al. 2022). For decades he was also at the center\nof the revival of Nishida studies that began in the 1980s. Like\nNishitani, Ueda explicitly orients himself to and from the standpoint\nof Zen and takes a topological, phenomenological, and existential\napproach to the idea of absolute nothingness (Ueda 2011c). Following\nin the tradition of the Kyoto School\u2019s dialogue with Western\nphilosophers, in one of his influential works Ueda engages the work of\nHusserl, Heidegger and other phenomenologists to articulate a\nreligiously charged philosophy of what he calls \u201ctwofold\nbeing-in-the-world\u201d (nij\u016bsekainaisonzai) (USS IX;\nsee also D\u00f6ll 2011, 2020; Krummel 2022).\n\nWhile the first layer in which the self is located is the historical\nhorizon of the everyday life-world, this horizon itself is ultimately\nfound to rest in an absolutely \u201cempty-expanse,\u201d a place of\nabsolute nothingness that both enfolds the everyday world as well as\ngrounds the radical freedom of the individual \u201cself-negating\nself\u201d (see USS IX, 22\u201324 and 324ff.). Ueda finds this idea\nof returning, by way of absolute self-negation, to a primordial\nwellspring of existence that is \u201cempty and free\u201d\n(ledig und frei) in Meister Eckhart, and, in an even more\nrarified form, in Zen Buddhism (see Davis 2008a). It is from the\nlatter that he borrows the term \u201cempty-expanse\u201d\n(kok\u016b) as a topological expression for\n\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101.\n\nFor Ueda, then, the two-layered-world is inhabited by a\ntwo-layered-self. This is how Ueda understands what Nishitani referred\nto as a \u201cself that is not a self.\u201d The self, as\nbeing-in-the-world, ultimately realizes itself in a moment of absolute\nself-negation where it dies to itself and stands as a\n\u201cnon-ego\u201d or \u201chollow-being\u201d in the\n\u201chollow-expanse\u201d which envelops the horizonal life-world.\nThe true self, as a self that becomes itself by passing through the\nabsolute negation of its ego, is thus a two-layered\nbeing-in-and-beyond-the-world; it stands in the horizon of the world\nwhich, in turn, rests in the empty-expanse of absolute\nnothingness.\n\nThis empty- or hollow-expanse is, to be sure, beyond conceptual\nunderstanding, insofar as concepts have as their medium the world of\nlanguage and its determinations of meaning. Nevertheless, what lies\nbeyond the reach of language is not to be understood as an ineffable\nmystical realm to which one ascends and remains, but rather is to be\nexperienced in extreme moments from the limits of language as that\nwhich at once tears through and mends, exceeds and encompasses,\ntranscends and transforms our linguistic horizons of intelligibility.\nInsofar as we do not close in on ourselves and rigidify our linguistic\ndelimitations of the world, we can open ourselves up to the silence of\nthis surrounding expanse of unlimited openness, which in turn allows\nus to speak and act more freely and responsibly in our worlds of\nlinguistic significance (see Ueda 2011b).\n3.7 The \u201cSelf that is not a Self\u201d and the Nothingness of Radical Subjectivity\n\nUeda argues that both the ego of the Cartesian cogito, as\nwell as the non-ego (Sanskrit: an\u0101tman; Japanese:\nmuga) of Buddhism, must ultimately be comprehended on the\nbasis of an understanding of the self as a repeated movement\nthrough a radical self-negation to a genuine self-affirmation.\nUeda\u2019s formula for this movement is: \u201cI, not being I, am\nI.\u201d Even when one says \u201cI am I,\u201d if we listen\nclosely there is a pause, a breath, between the first and the second\n\u201cI.\u201d Precisely that opening\u2014which necessarily occurs\nas a moment in the ceaseless movement by which the identity of the\nself is constituted\u2014is the \u201cecstatic space\u201d wherein\nan open encounter with others is possible.\n\nA genuine encounter with another person no longer takes place simply\nwithin my, or your, or even our world-horizon. Ueda uses the greeting\nof the bow as a concrete example to illustrate how mutual\nself-negation\u2014the emptying of all ego-centered presumptions and\nagendas\u2014returns us to a communal place where we, paradoxically,\nshare \u201cnothing\u201d in common. \u201cThere, by way of making\noneself into a nothingness, one returns into the infinite depths of\nthat \u2018between\u2019 where there is neither an I nor a you.\n\u2026 Then, when we rise again so as to come back to life anew and\nface one another, this becomes a matter of, as D\u014dgen puts it:\nthus am I; thus are you\u201d (Ueda 1991, 67; see USS X, 107ff.).\nOpen to others, and to the empty-expanse in which together we dwell, I\nam I (USS X, 23\u201324).\n\nNishitani had earlier used the expression \u201cthe self that is not\na self\u201d to characterize the shared endeavor of Nishida and\nTanabe as that of thinking \u201ca \u2018self that is not a\nself\u2019 turning on the axis of absolute nothingness\u201d (NKC\nIX, 238; Nishitani 1991, 175). The idea of the true self as a\n\u201cself that is not a self\u201d expresses an essential aspect of\nwhat Nishida and other Kyoto School thinkers call\u2014following D.\nT. Suzuki, who in turn gleaned the idea from the Diamond\nSutra\u2014the \u201clogic of soku-hi,\u201d a logic\nof \u201cis and is not\u201d or affirmation by way of negation (see\nNKZ XI, 398\u201399; Nishida 1987, 70; Akizuki 1996, 109\u2013152;\nYusa 2019). Nishida strikingly claims that the self is, at bottom, a\nself-contradiction, and that it can truly be itself only in the\nprocess of thoroughly negating and thus opening itself (NKZ VI, 290,\n377\u201378, 401). The self finds its most originary freedom, and its\nmost open engagement with others, through a radical self-negation\nwhich returns it, not to a higher Will or encompassing Being, but to\nkenotically self-negating absolute nothingness that, in turn, finds\nexpression only in the interaction of truly self-determining\nindividuals. For Nishida, the true individual is an interpersonal\nself-determining focal point of the self-determination of absolute\nnothingness, in other words, an interactive and creative element of a\ncreative world (see NKZ VIII, 343ff.).\n\nNishitani\u2019s first book, The Philosophy of Radical\nSubjectivity, sought a more originary conception of the human\nsubject than had been developed in modern Western philosophy. In\ngeneral, for Nishitani, modern \u201csubjectivity\u201d remains\nbound by a reifying attachment to things and ultimately to the ego.\nNishitani did recognized certain advances in the direction of a truly\n\u201cradical subjectivity\u201d in modern ideas such as that of\nindividual \u201cautonomy.\u201d For example, the Kantian idea of\nthe ethical \u201cperson,\u201d which opens itself to a universal\nstandpoint by way of a negation of the self-will of the ego, suggested\nfor Nishitani a \u201ckind of standpoint of\n\u2018non-ego\u2019\u201d (see NKC I, 60). However, the autonomy of\nthe Kantian ethical subject can also be seen as asserting a sublated\nform of self-will, namely in its will to form as well as to conform to\nthe universal. Nishitani finds profounder intimations of a truly\nradical subjectivity in both Meister Eckhart\u2019s mystical theology\nand Nietzsche\u2019s radical atheism, each of which in its own way\ngoes beyond, or digs beneath, attachments to and sublations of egoity.\nUltimately Nishitani returns to the language of Zen Buddhism to\nexpress his conception of the \u201cradical subjectivity of non-ego\n[muga]\u201d as a \u201csubjective nothingness\u201d\n(shutai-teki mu) (NKC I, 88).\n\nThis radical subjective nothingness is not to be confused with the\nrelative nothingness of a \u201csubjective consciousness\u201d which\nsets itself over against, and objectifies, the world. As with\nZen\u2019s k\u014dan of nothingness (mu), a realization of\nthe radical subjectivity of non-ego (mu-ga) entails breaking\nthrough the dualistic barrier that artificially separates self and\nworld. For Nishitani, this breakthrough is expressed as \u201cthe\nself-awareness of the bottom dropping out\u201d (NKC I, iii). It is a\nradical return, or \u201ctrans-descendence,\u201d to \u201cthe\nbackground of our own selves,\u201d to the Ungrund on which\nwe originally possess \u201cnot a single thing\u201d\n(mu-ichi-motsu) (NKC XI, 243).\n\nWith Nishitani\u2019s conception of a radical \u201csubjective\nnothingness,\u201d understood as a \u201cstandpoint of\nemptiness\u201d realized on the \u201cfield of emptiness,\u201d we\nfind an explicit appropriation of both the psychological and the\nmeontological (or mu-logical) paradigms of nothingness found\nin the traditions of East Asia. The notions of non-ego (muga)\nand \u201cno-mind\u201d or \u201cmind of nothingness\u201d\n(mushin) are thought in terms of the spontaneous openness of\nthe heart-mind that stands within the field of emptiness, an open\nplace which grants beings the free space needed for their unobstructed\n(muge) interactivity.\n\nAs we have seen, Nishida, Nishitani, and Ueda each conceived of\nabsolute nothingness in both an existential and a topological sense.\nAlthough Tanabe eschewed the topological conception of absolute\nnothingness, nevertheless, by understanding both the relative self and\nthe absolute in terms of a ceaseless movement of affirmation by way of\nradical negation, he too, in his own way, philosophically appropriated\nthe East Asian paradigms of psychological and meontological\nnothingness.\n4. Political Ventures and Misadventures\n\nIt should be clear by this point that the philosophical stakes\ninvolved in the Kyoto School\u2019s thought are high\u2014indeed\nthey invite us to rethink many of our most basic concepts and ways of\nexperiencing the world and ourselves. For this very reason Kyoto\nSchool thinkers promise to be especially valuable partners in any\npost-Eurocentric forum of philosophical dialogue. Genuine philosophy,\nafter all, thrives on the opportunity to call its fundamental\npresuppositions into question, even if stubbornly Eurocentric\nphilosophers fail to heed this crucial calling of their discipline.\nUnfortunately, the world of politics tends to be a far less\nself-critical and thus less genuinely dialogical forum of\nintercultural relations. The history of Western imperial domination of\nAsia is well documented (see Panikkar 1969), and post-colonial\ncritique of Western imperialism plays a prominent role in contemporary\nacademia. At the same time, in the field of East Asian studies, Kyoto\nSchool thinkers are frequently accused of contributing to the\npolitical ideology of Japanese imperialism in the 1930s and early\n1940s. However, we need to carefully examine the sense in which and\nthe extent to which the political thought of the Kyoto School is\ndeserving of its tainted reputation in this regard.\n4.1 The Razor\u2019s Edge of \u201cCooperative Resistance\u201d\n\nThe political ventures and misadventures of philosophers\u2014from\nSocrates and Plato to Marx and Heidegger in the West, and from\nConfucius and Hanfeizi to Gandhi and Nishida in the\nEast\u2014represent an often enduring though hardly always endearing\naspect of their legacies. Relating the \u201cideal\u201d world of\nphilosophy to the \u201creal\u201d world of political action is a\nperilous, if arguably obligatory, undertaking.\n\nThe pitfalls of political intervention are particularly deep when\nphilosophers find themselves in a nation headed down a road toward\ninjustice and disaster. What is a philosopher to do in such a\nsituation? Barring straightforward complicity, there appear to be\nthree choices: withdraw into reclusion, stand up in overt\nresistance, or attempt to negotiate a reorientation by means\nof immanent critique or cooperative correction.\nWhile many intellectuals in wartime Japan took the first course, some\ncourageous Leftists braved the second course. Both Tosaka Jun and Miki\nKiyoshi, the key figures of what is sometimes called the \u201cleft\nwing of the Kyoto School,\u201d died in prison in 1945 as a result of\ntheir intellectual resistance. The majority of the Kyoto School\nthinkers, however, including Nishida, Tanabe, and Nishitani, took the\nthird course of action.\n\nIn retrospect Nishitani wrote: \u201cMy attempt was, on the one hand,\nto explain where Japan was situated within the world to those\nintellectuals remaining on the sidelines [of politics]; and, on the\nother hand, with respect to the extremely nationalistic thought that\nwas becoming increasingly prevalent at the time, I attempted from\nwithin to open up a path for overcoming this extreme\nnationalism\u201d (NKC IV, 384). Rather than either stand up and die,\nor sit out and wait, Nishitani and other members of the Kyoto School\nattempted to walk the razor\u2019s edge of what \u014chashi\nRy\u014dsuke has called \u201canti-establishment cooperation\u201d\nor \u201ccooperative resistance\u201d (hantaiseiteki\nky\u014dryoku) (see \u014chashi 2001, 20ff.).\n\nTo be sure, the question of how successfully the Kyoto School managed\nto carry out this \u201ccooperative resistance\u201d (and the\nquestion of whether they cooperated more than resisted) is debatable,\nespecially given the fact that they did not succeed in altering the\ndisastrous orientation of the regime. Their intentions of cooperative\nresistance notwithstanding, the fact is that their political writings\nwere more or less successfully co-opted by the extreme nationalism\nthat they were more or less trying to reorient or overcome from\nwithin. Nevertheless, we must take care to separate their ideals from\nthe reality they were attempting to influence, and bear in mind the\nconstraints of their chosen path of immanent critique.\n\nWhatever the political failings of the Kyoto School thinkers may be,\nit is clear that certain crudely one-sided condemnations are at least\nas simplistic and misleading as are the occasional attempts of\noverzealous acolytes to whitewash everything they ever said or wrote.\nIt is, for example, highly misleading to sum up the Kyoto\nSchool\u2019s various philosophies of history as \u201ca thinly\ndisguised justification \u2026 for Japanese aggression and\ncontinuing imperialism,\u201d or to claim that \u201cno group helped\ndefend the state more consistently and enthusiastically \u2026 and\nnone came closer \u2026 to defining the philosophic contours of\nJapanese fascism\u201d (Najita & Harootunian 1998, 238\u201339;\nfor a severe critique of such polemical claims, see Parkes 1997 and\n2011). The latter dishonor, namely that of attempting to give\nquasi-philosophical expression to Japanese fascism, surely goes to the\nproponents of \u201cImperial Way Philosophy,\u201d who in fact\nharshly attacked the \u201cworld-historical philosophy\u201d of the\nKyoto School for being insufficiently Japan-centric (see \u014chashi\n2001, 71\u201372).\n\nJudicious critics of the wartime political writings of the Kyoto\nSchool must surely try to steer a middle course between and beyond\nwhat James Heisig aptly calls the \u201cside-steppers and the\nside-swipers\u201d (see Heisig 1990, 14). With this balance in mind,\nin the following sections let me highlight some of the key points and\nepisodes of the Kyoto School\u2019s wartime political ventures and\nmisadventures.\n4.2 Nishida\u2019s Reluctant \u201cWar over Words\u201d and his Ambivalent Universalism\n\nIn 1943 Yatsugi Kazuo, a member of the Center for National Strategy,\napproached Nishida and asked him to contribute a scholarly account of\nJapan\u2019s role in East Asia, that is, to help provide a rationale\nfor the creation of the so-called \u201cGreater East Asia\nCo-Prosperity Sphere.\u201d Nishida is said to have burst out in\nanger, shouting something like: \u201cWhat on earth do government\nofficials and militarists think these days, that scholars are like\nartisans from whom they can order something to be tailor made?\u201d\nAnd yet Yatsugi apparently countered to the effect that not only\nprominent Japanese scholars, such as Fukuzawa Yukichi, but also\nWestern philosophers, such as Kant and Adam Smith, did not neglect to\napply their theoretical insights to practical social and political\ncircumstances (see \u014chashi 2001, 47). In the end Nishida did agree\nto write an essay, \u201cPrinciples for a New World Order\u201d (NKZ\nXII, 426\u2013434; see Arisaka 1996), though his original text was\nedited and \u201csimplified\u201d by a sociologist serving as a\ngo-between. Nishida was even then disappointed that his attempt to\n\u201cbring out the dimension of universality present in the Japanese\nspirit\u201d seemed to have had no effect on Prime Minister\nT\u014dj\u014d Hideki and his bellicose regime (see Yusa 1994,\n124).\n\nFrom today\u2019s vantage point, Nishida\u2019s political writings\nappear highly ambivalent. On the one hand, his resistance to fascism\nand totalitarianism is unmistakable. Indeed it comes as no surprise\nthat he was in danger of being arrested\u2014and apparently only his\npublic stature and the fact that he had influential sympathizers\nwithin the moderate ranks of the government kept this from\nhappening\u2014when one reads the warning given in his 1941 speech\ndelivered directly to the emperor: \u201cAny totalitarian system that\nnegates outright the role of the individual is but an\nanachronism\u201d (NKZ XII, 271; see Yusa 1994, 111). Even in his\nmost compromised text, \u201cPrinciples for a New World Order,\u201d\nNishida urgently claims that the \u201cco-prosperity sphere\u201d\nmust not entail either ethnocentrism, expansionism,\nimperialism, colonialism, or totalitarianism (see NKZ XII,\n432\u201333). Elsewhere Nishida made clear that his vision was of a\nmulticultural world wherein neither the West would subsume the East\nnor vice versa (NKZ XIV, 404\u20135), wherein \u201cvarious\ncultures, while maintaining their own individual standpoints, would\ndevelop themselves through the mediation of the world\u201d (NKZ VII,\n452\u201353).\n\nOn the other hand, Nishida did think that nations\u2014and in\nparticular the Japanese nation with the emperor at its spiritual\ncenter\u2014had a special role to play in the historical formation of\nthis truly \u201cworldly world\u201d (sekai-teki sekai).\nMoreover, in his writings he did affirmatively employ such problematic\nphrases as \u201call the world under one roof\u201d\n(hakk\u014d-ichiu) and the \u201cimperial way\u201d\n(k\u014dd\u014d). While there is certainly room for criticism\nhere in light (and hindsight) of the historical record of\nJapan\u2019s political and cultural \u201cleadership\u201d (in\nfact, domination) of East Asia at this time, the issue of how to\ncritically evaluate Nishida\u2019s theoretical interventions is\ncomplicated by the hermeneutical fact that today we read such\ncatchwords and phrases through the semantic lenses of the right wing\nideologues who in the end succeeded in carving their definitions into\nthe annals of history. It must be kept in mind that, at the time, the\nprecise meaning of these phrases was still in dispute. Ueda Shizuteru\nhas aptly spoken of Nishida\u2019s \u201ctug-of-war over\nmeaning,\u201d a struggle which he ultimately lost (Ueda 1994, 97;\nalso see Goto-Jones 2005). Yusa Michiko writes in this regard:\n\u201cRather than invent a new vocabulary that would rise above the\nfray, [Nishida] took up the jargon and slogans of the day and sought\nto redeem them from their petty provincialism by opening them up to a\nmore universal perspective\u201d (Yusa 1994, 131).\n\nNevertheless, even after we have carried out a hermeneutically\nsensitive reconstruction of the context, and after we have finished\nreading between and behind the lines of his political texts, there\nundoubtedly remain a number of problematic aspects of Nishida\u2019s\npolitical thought, especially his idealistic view of the emperor\nsystem and Japan\u2019s purported world-historical calling to take on\na leadership role in the formation of an East Asia world (see Davis\n2006, 227\u201338; Osaki 2021, 117\u2013256; Arisaka 2020).\nAffirming the central place of the emperor in Japan as \u201can\nidentity of contradictions,\u201d Nishida cryptically writes:\n\u201cOur [i.e., Japan\u2019s] national polity is not simply a\ntotalitarianism. The Imperial House is the beginning and the end of\nour world, as the absolute present that embraces past and\nfuture\u201d (NKZ XII,\n 430).[16]\n And with regard to the central role of Japan in East Asia, he claims\nthat \u201cin order to build a particular world, a central figure\nthat carries the burden of the project is necessary. In East Asia\ntoday there is no other but Japan\u201d (NKZ XII, 429; Arisaka 1996,\n102).\n\nCritics may argue that Nishida\u2019s universalism is still plagued\nby an exemplary\n particularism,[17]\n and that he succeeds in questioning Eurocentrism only by way of\nshifting the locus of the concrete universal to Japan. Yoko Arisaka\nargues that \u201cthe chief claim of the defenders\u2014that\nNishida\u2019s philosophical \u2018universalism\u2019 is\nincompatible with nationalist ideology\u2014fails because\nuniversalist discourse was used both as a tool of liberation and\noppression in Japan\u2019s case\u201d (Arisaka 1999, 242). Arisaka\ncritically adds, however, that \u201cthe idea that a particular\nnation may be the bearer of a universal principle, such as freedom or\ndemocracy, and that, therefore, its actions in history serve a higher\nend, should be familiar from recent American experience\u201d (ibid.,\n244; also see Maraldo 1994, 355).\n\nTo be fair to Nishida, we should confess that we today have yet to\nsolve the post-Enlightenment aporia of how to reconcile universal\nhumanism with cultural particularity (a debate we inherit in part from\nthe Kant-Herder controversy). In other words, the question remains of\nhow to configure a multicultural world of dialogue instead of either\nan imperialistic monoculture or a clash of civilizations. In our\nsearch for an answer to this urgent question, we may still have much\nyet to learn from a critical appropriation of Nishida\u2019s thought\n(see Feenberg 1995; Maraldo 1995; Elberfeld 1999; Kopf 2011; Davis\n2013a; Krummel 2014; and Goto-Jones 2002, 2005, 2008, 2009).\n4.3 Controversial Wartime Symposia, and Nishitani\u2019s Nation of Non-Ego\n\nNishida\u2019s ambivalent political stance\u2014between a\npost-imperialistic vision of a multicultural new world order on the\none hand and an assertion of Japan\u2019s destined world-historical\nrole in realizing this vision on the other\u2014was carried forth\ninto even more controversial political engagements by his students\nNishitani Keiji, K\u014dyama Iwao, K\u014dsaka Masaaki, Suzuki\nShigetaka, and to a lesser extent Shimomura Toratar\u014d. As\nmentioned in subsection 2.1, a significant, if stigmatizing, stage in\nthe formation of the identity of the Kyoto School involved the\nparticipation of several of its members in two wartime symposia, the\nLiterary World\u2019s 1942 symposium on \u201cOvercoming\nModernity\u201d (reprinted in Kawakami & Takeuchi 1979; English\ntranslation in Calichman 2008) and the 1941\u201343 roundtable\ndiscussions published serially in the journal\nCh\u016b\u014dk\u014dron and later as a monograph, The\nStandpoint of World History and Japan (K\u014dsaka et al 1943;\nEnglish translation in Williams 2014).\n\nThe Overcoming Modernity symposium has been aptly\ncharacterized as \u201ca premature challenge to the questions that\nhave yet to be answered today\u201d (Minamoto 1994, 200). Even one of\nthe most critical accounts of this symposium\u2014an account which\nargues that the \u201conly destination reached by the symposium on\novercoming modernity was the place where Japan itself had been\novercome by modernity\u201d\u2014concedes that: \u201cIt is,\nnevertheless, important to point out that the very critique mounted by\nJapanese against modernity prefigured precisely all of those doubts\nand obsessions concerning subjectivity, cultural difference, and even\nracism that have become the signatures of a Western and putatively\nglobal discourse that marks our own historical conjuncture\ntoday\u201d (Harootunian 2000, 94).\n\nAs discussed in subsection 2.2, the Kyoto School participants spoke of\nan overcoming of modernity that can take place only by way of passing\nthrough modernity, a stance that represented a\ncountertendency to the rejection of modern Western rationality by the\nJapanese Romantic School and other participants in the symposium. In\nother words, the Kyoto School participants did not lament the\nmodernization-via-Westernization of Japan, nor did they nostalgically\nplea for a return to a pre-modern age; rather, they called for a\nfurther step forward, but one that would involve creatively recovering\nviable elements of Japanese tradition at the same time as building on\nthe best of what could be learned from the West. This stance shows up\nclearly in Nishitani\u2019s debate with Kobayashi Hideo, who argued\nfor a rejection of modernity and a return to the pre-modern Japanese\nclassics (see Kawakami & Takeuchi 1979, 217ff.). Throughout his\ncareer Nishitani consistently spoke of overcoming modernity only by\nway of passing through it, and in this process tradition was to be\ncreatively appropriated, not conservatively retreated to. He wrote:\n\u201cThere is no turning back to the way things were. \u2026 Our\ntradition must be appropriated from the direction in which we are\nheading, as a new possibility\u201d (NKC VIII, 183; Nishitani 1990,\n179); and: \u201cSimply put, the backward looking return to tradition\nis straightaway to be forward looking\u201d (NKC XIX, 104). Later in\nlife Nishitani continued to stress that Japanese Buddhist\norganizations need to embrace their historicality, which means to\nmodernize and then postmodernize; only in this way can they continue\nto play a vital role in Japanese society as well as offer the\npossibilities of their ways of life to the wider world (Nishitani\n2006, 36\u201338).\n\nIn the Ch\u016b\u014dk\u014dron discussions as well the Kyoto\nSchool resolutely attempted to think from the \u201cstandpoint of\nworld history.\u201d Problematically, however, they asserted a\nleadership role for Japan in the present moment, which they viewed as\na turning point in world history. If the standpoint of world history\nhad indeed been first opened up by both Western universalism\nand imperialism, they argued, it was the non-Western nation\nof Japan that was in a unique position to free the world from the\nchains of the latter in order to realize the true potential of the\nformer.\n\nIn his book written around the same time, View of the World and\nthe Nation (1941), Nishitani went so far as to claim that this\nwas the moment in time when the \u201cfocal point of world\nhistory\u201d was to become the Japanese nation, just as previously\nworld history had centered on the Roman Empire and then later on the\nBritish Empire. However, Nishitani argued, unlike the former two\nempires Japan\u2019s historical mission was to bring about a world\nthat has \u201cno specific center\u201d but rather consists of\nvarious \u201cpolitically and culturally unified spheres\u201d (NKC\nIV, 298\u2013300). The Japanese nation would be able to carry out\nthis mission, he crucially adds, only if it incorporates a religious\nspirit of self-negation, thus becoming what he calls a \u201cnation\nof non-ego\u201d rather than a self-centered aggressive empire (NKC\nIV, 285\u201386). In this idealistic vision, which unfortunately had\nlittle to do with the cruel realities of Japanese expansionism, Japan\nwas to be an altogether new kind of empire, a self-negating and\ncompassionate one that would help other nations to cooperatively form\ntheir own identities, rather than an aggressive and\n\u201cimperialistic\u201d one that would remold others into inferior\nreplicas of itself. (It remains for us to ask how best to characterize\ntoday\u2019s political superpowers and economic empires, and how to\nrelate their ideologies to their realities.)\n\nIf there is a lasting merit to Nishitani\u2019s wartime political\nwritings and the Ch\u016b\u014dk\u014dron discussions, it\nmight be found in part in their critique of the contradictions and\nhypocrisies of Western imperialism (see, for example, K\u014dsaka et\nal. 1943, 348ff.), together with their insistence that Japan\u2019s\n\u201cleading role\u201d in Asia not become that of an imperialist\nor colonizer (see ibid., 204\u20135; also see Nishitani\u2019s\n\u201cMy View of \u2018Overcoming Modernity\u2019,\u201d reprinted\nin Kawakami & Takeuchi 1979, 32). The lasting infamy of the\nCh\u016b\u014dk\u014dron discussions, on the other hand, can\nbe found not only in their idealistic political na\u00efvet\u00e9,\nbut also in their idealization and even whitewashing of political\nrealities (such as Japanese aggression in China and other parts of\nAsia), as well as in such disturbing specific suggestions as that of\n\u201cJapanizing\u201d or \u201chalf-Japanizing\u201d some of the\n\u201cmore superior\u201d ethnic groups in Asia in order to assist\nin instituting the Japanese led \u201cCo-Prosperity Sphere\u201d\n(K\u014dsaka et al. 1943, 262\u201363, 337).\n4.4 The \u201c\u014cshima Memos\u201d: Record of a Think Tank for Navy Moderates\n\nIt is now evident that the political activities of the Kyoto School\nduring the war were even more involved\u2014and even more filled with\nambiguity\u2014than was previously thought. \u014chashi Ry\u014dsuke\ndiscovered and published in 2001 some wartime notebooks of \u014cshima\nYasuma, a student of Tanabe\u2019s (\u014chashi 2001). These\nnotebooks document in detail secret meetings regularly held by Kyoto\nSchool members (including Tanabe and Nishitani but not Nishida) at the\nbequest of the Japanese navy between February 1942 and just before the\nend of the war. While on the one hand the existence of these secret\nmeetings demonstrates an even more intimate connection between the\nKyoto School and the military than was previously known, on the other\nhand it is crucially significant that they were in cooperation with a\ncertain moderate faction of the navy, a faction that was opposed to\nthe extremists that dominated the army. There had long existed a\nconsiderable tension between the bellicose arrogance of the army and\nthe comparatively more moderate and worldly stance of the navy. As the\npolitically more powerful army was setting a war-bound course for\nPearl Harbor, some reticent navy officials evidently petitioned the\nKyoto School to shed light on the political situation from their\n\u201cworld-historical standpoint,\u201d presumably in order to sway\npublic sentiment in a more prudent direction.\n\nIn short, the \u201c\u014cshima Memos\u201d help reveal how the\nKyoto School found themselves in a position where they were called on\nto fight a \u201cwar of thought\u201d on two fronts: against Western\nimperialism, they felt called on to delineate a world-historical role\nfor Japan in freeing itself and other Asian peoples from colonization\nand exploitation by the Western empires; and, against Japanese\nultra-nationalism, they felt that it was up to them to convince the\npublic and the military of the illegitimacy of an imperialistic\nresponse to Western imperialism.\n\n\u014cshima Yasuma had himself published, in 1965, an often overlooked\naccount of these meetings under the title, \u201cThe Pacific War and\nthe Kyoto School: On the Political Participation of\nIntellectuals\u201d (\u014cshima 2000, 274\u2013304; also see Horio\n1994, 301ff.). In this article, \u014cshima summarized the evolving\npurpose of the secret Kyoto School meetings in three stages: In the\nvery first meetings (which apparently took place prior to those\ndocumented in the recovered notebooks), the main theme was \u201chow\nto avoid the outbreak of war.\u201d Since war in fact broke out very\nsoon thereafter, the theme quickly switched to \u201chow to bring the\nwar to a favorable end as soon as possible, by way of rationally\npersuading the army.\u201d To do this they reportedly agreed that it\nwould be necessary to overthrow the cabinet of T\u014dj\u014d Hideki.\nHowever, according to \u014cshima, all criticism of T\u014dj\u014d and\nthe army had to be expurgated in the discussions published in the\npages of Ch\u016b\u014dk\u014dron, and the statements of the\nKyoto School had to be \u201cveiled in two or three layers of\ncloth\u201d in order to avoid censorship and persecution. Towards the\nend of the war, the theme of the secret meetings is said to have\nchanged to that of \u201chow to handle the postwar\nsituation.\u201d\n\nAmong these three themes only the second is recorded in any detail in\nthe notebooks that were discovered and published by \u014chashi as the\n\u201c\u014cshima Memos.\u201d Although there may well have been\npreliminary discussions on how to avoid war, more explicit references\nto overthrowing T\u014dj\u014d Hideki, and more lengthy discussions\nabout postwar issues, these do not in fact show up in the recovered\nnotebooks. Nevertheless, the \u201c\u014cshima Memos\u201d do show\nus a more detailed and uncensored account of the Kyoto School\u2019s\n\u201cwar of thought\u201d on two fronts during a tumultuous and\ntragic time of what was, in fact, Japan\u2019s imperialistic response\nto Western imperialism.\n4.5 After the War: Tanabe\u2019s Metanoetic Turn and Nishitani\u2019s Other Cheek\n\nTheir ambivalent wartime stance between supporting the nationalistic\nideology and subjecting it to critique from a pluralistic and global\nperspective\u2014in other words, their attempt to walk a\nrazor\u2019s edge of \u201ccooperative\nresistance\u201d\u2014ironically earned the Kyoto School a suspect\nreputation in Japan both before and after the end of\nthe war. As Nishitani confided later to a student: \u201cDuring the\nwar we were struck on the cheek from the right; after the war we were\nstruck on the cheek from the left.\u201d\n\nDuring the war, the stance of the Kyoto School was considered too\ncosmopolitan and insufficiently nationalistic, even anti-war. The\ndiscussions published in The Standpoint of World History and\nJapan were branded by the Imperial Way ideologues as\n\u201civory-tower speculations that risked reducing the Empire to\nsimply one more category of world history,\u201d and further\nprintings of the book were reportedly stopped by the government\ncensors (see Horio 1994, 291). After the war, the Kyoto School\u2019s\nidealistic attempts to impart meaning and direction to Japan\u2019s\n\u201cworld historical mission\u201d were seen\u2014especially by\nliberals and leftists that had at long last been freed from repression\nand persecution\u2014as support for its de facto\nmilitaristic fascism. Nishitani and others were purged for several\nyears from their university positions. Even when they were later\nreinstated, the stigma of the Kyoto School as having \u201ccooperated\nin the war\u201d was hardly erased. Their political thought in\nparticular was dismissed in toto, and it was not until\ndecades later that the topic of \u201covercoming modernity\u201d was\nonce again given serious critical attention (see Kawakami &\nTakeuchi 1979; Hiromatsu 1989; and \u014chashi 1992, 143ff.).\n\nThe Kyoto School thinkers rarely responded directly to their critics\nafter the war, and we can only speculate on the reasons for this (see\nHorio 1994, 300). They accepted suspension from their posts without\ncomment or complaint, and continued on with their philosophizing,\nalbeit without the overtly political element of their thought.\nNishitani, for example, came into his own as a philosopher of religion\nin the postwar era. He continued to philosophically develop Eastern\nideas, those of Zen Buddhism in particular, in dialogue with medieval\nChristian mysticism as well as postmodern existentialism and\nphenomenology and in response to what he saw as the central problem of\nmodernity, namely, nihilism. In his mature attempts to \u201covercome\nnihilism by way of passing through nihilism\u201d (NKC XX, 192), we\nfind a significant thread of continuity with his pre-war and wartime\nattempts to overcome (Western) modernity by way of passing through it.\nBut it is nevertheless possible to mark a crucial and self-critical\n\u201cturn\u201d in his thinking with regard to the question of the\npolitical role\u2014or, as it turns out, the lack of one\u2014to be\nplayed by the Japanese state in this overcoming of modernity and\nnihilism by way of passing through them (see Davis 2008b).\n\nTanabe got a head start on the postwar critics and toward the end of\nthe war began thinking his way through a radical crisis of\nself-critique. Hardly less controversial than the roundtable\ndiscussions of the younger members of the Kyoto School have been\nTanabe\u2019s application\u2014or misapplication\u2014of his\n\u201clogic of the specific\u201d to a discourse on the legitimacy\nof the self-assertion of the Japanese nation-state as an archetype for\nothers. The \u201clogic of the specific\u201d had originally been\nconceived, in critique of Bergson and Nishida, as a reappraisal of the\nlogical and ethical role that ethnic specificity plays in mediating\nthe particular individual and universal humanity. Adapting\nHegel\u2019s political philosophy, Tanabe thought that the\nnation-state could both embody the ethnic specificity of the people\nand raise it out of its inherent irrationality. As a concrete\nuniversal, the nation-state was, if not the absolute itself, in some\nsense the dialectical manifestation of the absolute on earth.\n\nThe critical lapse came when Tanabe irrationally proposed that the\n\u201crelative absolute\u201d of the Japanese nation-state could\nserve as a kind of \u201csupreme archetype\u201d for other nations\n(see THZ VI, 232\u201333). James Heisig writes that, in so doing,\nTanabe \u201ctook a step that was fatal but really unnecessary, if\nnot outright inconsistent with the principles of his logic\u2026.\nAccording to his own logic, the community of the human race is to be\nmade up of a community of nations that have found a way to transcend\ntheir specificity without transcending time and culture. Each nation\nmay come about as an instance of the generic universal, but nothing in\nthe logic of the specific allows any one instance to become an\narchetype for the others. It is as if Tanabe were quoting himself out\nof context\u201d (Heisig 2001, 136\u201337; also see Heisig\n1994).\n\nTanabe finally came to his senses and, in a striking metanoetic turn,\nrenounced these political assertions and dove into the philosophy of\nreligion. Philosophy as Metanoetics, the first parts of which\nwere delivered as lectures in 1944 before the end of the war, was\ncomposed not only as a personal self-critique, but also as a call to\nself-critique on the part of the entire nation, and indeed ultimately\nas a call for an \u201cabsolute critique\u201d of human rationality\nas such (see the Preface to THZ X; Tanabe 1986). It is the last of\nthese that is the central theme of the book: the idea that the human\nreason is inevitably driven to antinomies through which it must\nrepeatedly die to its own self-power in order to be reborn again\nthrough the workings of an Other-power. It is nevertheless true that\n\u201cone looks through that work in vain for any admission of guilt\nfor particular actions or statements that he had made\u201d (Heisig\n2001, 151). In any case, Tanabe\u2019s public (if vague) repentance\nwas no more successful than the silence of other Kyoto School thinkers\nin convincing the majority of postwar Japanese academics to refrain\nfrom throwing the baby of their philosophical insights out with the\nbathwater of their political misadventures.\n\nOnly in the past few decades has the reputation of the Kyoto School\nbeen significantly rehabilitated in Japan, due in part to a general\nrecovery of the nation from immersion in the march of postwar economic\nprogress and evasion of unresolved cultural aporias, in part to a\ngeneral reaffirmation of cultural identity (including all too often a\npendulum swing back to ethnocentric reassertions of \u201cJapanese\nuniqueness\u201d), and in part to the positive attention the School\nhas received from scholars in the West. It is worthwhile noting, as\nFujita Masakatsu does in his preface to The Philosophy of the\nKyoto School, that prior to 2001 surprisingly few articles or\nbooks had appeared in Japan with a thematic focus on the \u201cKyoto\nSchool\u201d as such, even though hundreds of studies had treated\n\u201cNishida Philosophy.\u201d Yet there are promising signs that\nwe are entering a new academic era in which critical yet appreciative\nwork on the Kyoto School can be cooperatively undertaken in Japan, in\nthe West, and recently even in other parts of East Asia (see Fujita et\nal. 2003; Heisig 2004; Synthesis Philosophica 2004; Fujita\n& Davis 2005; Hori & Curley 2008; Heisig & Uehara 2008;\nLam & Cheung 2009; Bouso & Heisig 2009; Davis, Schroeder,\n& Wirth 2011; Elberfeld & Arisaka 2014; Yusa 2017; Davis\n2020a; Liao et al. 2022).\n\nDespite the persistence of a faction of polemical intellectual\nhistorians, many philosophers worldwide today view the political\nmisadventures of the Kyoto School as lamentable footnotes to the main\ntext of their laudable philosophical endeavors. While research into\ntheir political thought\u2014regarding what it tried to say then and\nregarding what it can or cannot help us to think now\u2014remains\nnecessary and important, at the end of the day many are likely to\nagree with James Heisig when he emphatically writes: \u201cOne\nhas \u2026 to ignore the greatest bulk of the writings of these\nthinkers to arrive at the conclusion that anything approaching or\nsupporting the imperialistic ideology of wartime Japan belongs to the\nfundamental inspiration of their thought\u201d (Heisig 2001, 6).\nThe philosophical and cross-cultural legacy of the Kyoto School lies\nelsewhere.\n5. The Cross-Cultural Legacy of the Kyoto School\n5.1 Between and Beyond East and West\n\nIn this concluding section, let us return to the question of the\nlegacy of the Kyoto School with regard to comparative or\ncross-cultural philosophy. Today many scholars, in Japan as well as in\nWestern countries, are calling this \u201cworld philosophy\u201d\n(It\u014d et al. 2020), a term I take to mean any approach to\nphilosophy that does not restrict its purview and the sources on which\nit draws to any one tradition, such as the tradition of Western\nphilosophy. As mentioned at the outset, the Kyoto School thinkers were\nall dedicated scholars of various fields and figures of Western\nphilosophy; and yet, at the same time, they kept one foot firmly in\ntouch with their native East Asian traditions, those of\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism in particular. This bipedal stance placed\nthem in an extraordinary position between \u201cEast and West\u201d\nand allowed them to go beyond this binary abstraction.\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that the philosophies of the Kyoto\nSchool do not simply drift impartially on the seas of academic\ncomparison, nor do the Kyoto School philosophers see themselves\nprimarily as mediators of interreligious dialogue. As existentially\nengaged cross-cultural philosophers, they are above all seekers after\ntruth, and they argue passionately for the validity of seeing the self\nand the world in certain ways. As we have seen, while each member of\nthe Kyoto School has his own vision of the truth, they share (and\ndebate) certain fundamental ideas, such as one or another version of\nthe core notion of absolute nothingness and the idea of coming to a\ngenuine self-awareness by way of emptying the ego. And however much\ntheir texts reflect an intimate dialogue with and critical\nappropriation of ideas from Western philosophers, it can be said that\nmany of their main theses nevertheless reflect a distinctly East Asian\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist and Japanese cultural influence.\n\nNevertheless, this does not mean that they merely gave modern\nexpression to traditional East Asian Buddhist thought or Japanese\nculture. It would be more accurate to say that their philosophies are\ncritical and creative developments of these\ntraditions. Even this way of putting it would not do justice to the\ninfluence exerted on their thought by the Western philosophies with\nwhich they grappled so intensely. Although Hisamatsu, Nishitani, Abe,\nUeda and others do explicitly philosophize from the standpoint of Zen,\nand although Takeuchi, Hase, and others do so from the standpoint of\nShin Buddhism, it would be misleading to simply and without\nqualification characterize either Nishida\u2019s or Tanabe\u2019s\nmultifaceted philosophies as \u201cEastern\u201d or\n\u201cBuddhist.\u201d\n\nFor example, Tanabe\u2019s early \u201clogic of the specific,\u201d\nwith its concern for the manner in which ethnic specificities mediate\nparticular individuals and universal humanity, can be read more as a\ncritical appropriation of Hegelian dialectical logic and political\nphilosophy than as any straightforward development of East Asian or\nBuddhist thought. And in his various later writings on the philosophy\nof religion, Tanabe wanders between a preference for Shin Buddhism,\nChristianity, and finally Zen Buddhism (see Himi 1990, 129\u2013341).\nWith regard to Nishida, an acute concern with questions of\nepistemology, logic, individual autonomy, creativity, and the\nhistoricity of the world are essential to his thought in ways that are\nmore \u201cmodern Western\u201d than \u201ctraditional\nEastern\u201d; and Nishida at times explicitly indicates his\ndissatisfaction with what he sees as related weaknesses in traditional\nEastern thought.\n\nOf course, one might respond: even if Nishida methodologically takes\nhis questions from Western philosophy, his responses to these\nquestions reflect his East Asian roots at least as much as his Western\nstudies. To the Western ontological question of being, his answer is a\nmeontology of absolute nothingness. It might be that his systematic\nphilosophical articulations of the idea of absolute nothingness owe\nmore to Western than Eastern texts. Yet, he nevertheless understands\nhimself to have autonomously (i.e., in the process of engaging in a\nnonsectarian philosophical search for truth) given expression to the\nformless origin that is harbored in the traditions of the East. In\nretrospect Nishida wrote: \u201cIt is not that I conceived of my way\nof thinking in dependence on Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism; and yet it\nhas come into accord with it\u201d (NKZ XIV, 408). Nishitani could\nhave said something similar of his career path, which led him through\nthe study of Western philosophy and mysticism and \u201cback\u201d\nto the standpoint of Zen. Other Kyoto School thinkers took even less\nof an Occidental excursion before making what H\u00f6lderlin called a\n\u201chomecoming though the foreign.\u201d And some, like Hisamatsu\nand Takeuchi, began their scholarly pursuits with a self-understanding\nas a Zen or Shin Buddhist thinker.\n\nPerhaps most controversial, from a cross-cultural political point of\nview, is Nishida\u2019s and other Kyoto School thinkers\u2019\nsuggestion that modern Japanese culture and philosophy in particular\nhas the potential to make room for the cooperative meeting of the\nstrengths of East and West (see NKZ XIV, 416\u201317; also Nishida\n1964, 365). What are we to make of such bold and sweeping claims?\nThere appear to be two problematical assertions involved: first, an\noverly generalized, if not at times hypostatized, split of cultural\nspheres into \u201cEast\u201d and \u201cWest\u201d; and second, a\nclaim that an idea with deeper roots in the so-called East, namely\nabsolute nothingness, can be developed so as to provide the\nphilosophical meeting place of both East and\n West.[18]\n\nEven sympathetic readers of the Kyoto School are often highly critical\nof this type of comparative thinking in terms of \u201cEast\u201d\n(t\u014dy\u014d) and \u201cWest\u201d\n(seiy\u014d). Although he affirms that \u201cthe\nKyoto-school philosophers give the west a way into the east like none\nother,\u201d James Heisig complains that \u201cthe East\u201d which\nthe Kyoto School sets up over against \u201cthe West\u201d is\nsomething of an invention: \u201cAt best, it is one constellation of\na heritage too long and too plural to be represented fairly by\nJapan\u201d (Heisig 2001, 271\u201372). John Maraldo goes further\nand claims that \u201cthe problems Nishida deals with are universal,\nand his way of dealing with them contrasts as much with other Asian\nphilosophers as with philosophers of the so-called West\u201d\n(Maraldo 1995, 196). Is it necessary and are we ready to do as Maraldo\nsuggests, and \u201cput \u2018East\u2019 and \u2018West\u2019 to\nrest\u201d?\n\nI myself think this complex issue requires a careful and nuanced\nresponse, in part because \u201cthe East\u201d and \u201cthe\nWest\u201d are not in fact isomorphically oppositional terms. While I\ncertainly agree with the wish to avoid overgeneralizations and\npolitically charged polarizations, and while I think the Kyoto School\nphilosophers do need to be read critically in this regard, I am\nequally wary of a \u201cglobalization of thought\u201d that amounts\nto a de facto colonization of \u201cnon-Western\u201d traditions by\n\u201cWestern\u201d methods and categories of thinking; and simply\nrefraining from speaking of \u201cthe West\u201d could amount to\nmerely evading and thus exacerbating this problem. Moreover, while it\nis indeed important to debunk essentializing, homogenizing, and\nusually self-aggrandizing conceptions of \u201cthe West\u201d or\n\u201cWestern civilization,\u201d a tradition that has in truth been\nfar more fruitfully \u201centanlged\u201d with other traditions and\nfar more varied that historical narratives centered on a pantheon of\ngreat white men would have it (see Elberfeld 2017, 21\u2013127; Mac\nSweeney 2023), the threads of the\nGreco-Roman-Judeo-Christian-Euro-American traditions and cultures have\nnevertheless been woven together coherently enough to warrant\nsometimes and in some contexts speaking of \u201cthe West.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, \u201cthe East\u201d (or \u201cAsia\u201d for that\nmatter) is a more irredeemably problematic concept, since it refers to\na far less coherently woven set of traditions and cultures, especially\nfrom the perspective of India (which, for example, did not appropriate\nany Chinese tradition the way China appropriated Buddhism). Some may\nwant to argue that, from Japan\u2019s perspective, or at least from a\nJapanese Buddhist perspective that weaves together Indo-Sino-Japanese\nthreads, it may still make some sense to speak sometimes in terms of\n\u201cthe East.\u201d Yet such usages of this term are not only\novergeneralizing but also Japan-centric. I therefore think it is best\nto restrict our broadest generalizations in this case to \u201cEast\nAsia\u201d or \u201cMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism\u201d or\n\u201cJapan,\u201d and to bear in mind that even these expressions\nreduce a diverse manifold to a broad concept. The concept of\n\u201cthe East\u201d goes too far, crossing the line from a\nheuristically useful generalization to a distortingly homogenizing\novergeneralization.\n\nTo be sure, as Thomas Kasulis reminds us (Kasulis 2018, 36 and 41),\ngeneralizations are not universalizations; by definition there are\nexceptions to any general definition of something. The bigger the\ngeneralization, the more exceptions will it have. Still, we cannot\nthink without generalities, and it is no doubt a matter of\n\u201cpractical wisdom\u201d (phron\u0113sis) to know when\nto construct and when to deconstruct them. Thus, even though we must\nbe careful to discern the appropriate contexts in which it makes sense\nto speak in such vast and abstract terms, it is no more advisable to\nunequivocally annihilate general concepts such as \u201cthe\nWest\u201d and \u201cEast Asia\u201d than it is to narrowly define\nor absolutize their relative coherences and mutual differences.\n\nWith regard to the hermeneutics of modern cross-cultural thinking, in\ngeneral I believe that the attempt to obliterate the borders that\nseparate cultural spheres is as unrealistic and potentially pernicious\nas is the attempt to hermetically seal them up. Border lines between\ncultures (as between languages) exist, but they are always porous and\nshifting, and each culture is in itself varied and mobile. Needless to\nsay, defining, comparing, contrasting, and above all evaluating the\nrelative worth of various traditions, remain undertakings fraught with\ntheoretical, ethical and political pitfalls. The theoretical and\ncultural legacies of colonialism and Orientalism remain with us long\nafter the political empires have receded. Moreover, in these\npostcolonial or decolonial times we all too often experience reactive\nfabrications of homogeneous cultural identity and assertions of\ncounter-superiority, reactions which ironically reinforce the same\nkind of colonial divisions and obsessions with unadulterated\nself-identity that were in part imposed by, or imported from, the\nworst of the West.\n\nIn Japan, certain retroactive constructions of identity and reactive\ncounter-assertions of superiority have taken the form of what is\ncalled nihonjin-ron: theories of \u201cJapaneseness\u201d\nor \u201cJapanese uniqueness\u201d (see Dale 1986). In modern\nJapanese history, such reactive cultural self-obsessions and\nself-assertions have taken either the form of denying Japan\u2019s\ndeep-rooted traditional connections with its East Asian neighbors, or\nthe form of claiming that Japan has uniquely embodied and perfected\n\u201cthe essence of the East.\u201d If the former type of claim is\nmost in evidence in postwar and contemporary Japan, the latter is\nfound, for example, in the Meiji thinker Okakura Tenshin\u2019s\ndeclaration that, while \u201cAsia is one,\u201d Japan alone is\n\u201cthe real repository of the trust of Asiatic thought and\nculture\u201d (Okakura 2000, 1 and 5).\n\nWhere do the Kyoto School thinkers stand with respect to such culture\nwars? To be sure, the Ch\u016b\u014dk\u014dron discussions in\nparticular often asserted that modern Japan was uniquely suited to\ninstitute and represent the \u201cGreater East Asia Co-Prosperity\nSphere,\u201d and this undoubtedly reflected a widespread post-Meiji\nJapanese conflation of political, industrial, and military development\nwith cultural superiority. Nishida also felt that modern Japan was in\na unique political and cultural position to host a fruitful marriage\nof East and West, and Tanabe went so far as to set the nation of Japan\nup as an archetype for others. In the Kyoto School\u2019s wartime\npolitical writings, there indeed remains much grist for the mills of\ncontemporary cultural critics, especially for those with hermeneutical\nblindfolds or purportedly perfect hindsight. Yet a critique of their\npolitical misadventures and cultural assertions, as necessary as it\nis, may in fact reveal something more peripheral than central to the\ncross-cultural thinking of the Kyoto School. It is at least necessary\nto keep both eyes open: one ready to criticize and the other willing\nto learn.\n\nWe should note that even when Nishida broadly contrasts \u201cWestern\nbeing\u201d with \u201cEastern nothingness,\u201d he in fact\nimmediately goes on to explore finer distinctions between the Greek,\nRoman, and Judeo-Christian threads of the Western tradition, and\nbetween the Indian, Chinese, and Japanese threads of the Eastern\ntradition. If his essentializing or overgeneralizing of these threads\ndoes remain in various respects problematic, it is nevertheless hardly\nthe case that he and the other Kyoto School thinkers never questioned\nthe homogeneity of either \u201cthe East\u201d or \u201cthe\nWest.\u201d Secondly, although they have been accused both of\ncontributing to the \u201cmyth of Japanese uniqueness\u201d and of\n\u201creverse Orientalism\u201d (see Dale 1986 and Faure 1995), the\ncase is far from this simple. In a time of uncritical cultural\nself-adulation by the Japanese ultranationalists in power, Nishida\nboldly urged that \u201cboth the strong points and weaknesses of our\nculture should be openly and honestly pointed out,\u201d for\n\u201cwe cannot take any one culture and call it the\nculture\u201d (Nishida 1964, 351 and 353).\n\nFighting a conceptual war simultaneously on two fronts, against\nWestern and Japanese ethnocentrisms, Nishida wrote that\n\u201cuntil now Westerners have thought that their own culture is the\nmost superior human culture that exists, and that human culture\ninevitably develops in the direction of their own culture\u2014hence,\nas Easterners and other peoples who are lagging behind advance\nforward, they must become the same as [Westerners].\u201d Even some\nJapanese, he regrets, think this way. And yet, he objects,\n\u201cthere is something radically different in [the culture of] the\nEast.\u201d According to Nishida, the development of the West will\nsubsume this difference no more than the East will subsume the West.\nEven if humanity does share a common root (what he calls, adapting an\nexpression from Goethe, an \u201cur-culture\u201d of multiple\npossibilities), the development of its branches and leaves is a matter\nof diversification, not homogenization. Globalization should thus be\nthought of, in Nishida\u2019s vision, as many branches of the same\ntree supplementing one other on the basis of both their deep-rooted\ncommonality and their irreducible diversity (NKZ XIV,\n402\u20136 and 417).\n\nTo be sure, there inevitably remains for us the question of the\n\u201cplace\u201d and manner in which this global communication\nbetween cultures should take place. But without a \u201cview from\nnowhere,\u201d the only thing we can do is to attempt to critically\nand creatively take up ideas that have particular genealogies and\ndialogically develop them into what are provisionally more universally\nviable forms. Just as concepts of democracy, hermeneutics, and indeed\nphilosophia itself have particular cultural lineages, so do\nthe ideas of emptiness (Japanese: k\u016b; Sanskrit:\n\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101), nothingness (Japanese: mu;\nChinese: wu), and the true self (shin no jiko) as a\nnon-ego (Japanese: muga; Sanskrit: an\u0101tman)\nthat opens itself to an encounter with others by radically emptying\nitself. Nevertheless, all of these ideas may very well contribute\nsomething to an intercultural dialogue concerning the very place and\nmanner in which a genuine encounter between cultures and individuals\ncan and should take place. The locution \u201cworld philosophy\u201d\nis, to my mind, best understood as a multifaceted forum for\ncross-cultural dialogue concerning such issues, a forum that is itself\nalways in the process of being co-constructed by all those who\nparticipate in it.\n5.2 Japanese Philosophy in the World\n\nIt is not, therefore, necessarily ethnocentric for Japanese thinkers\nto suggest the potential efficacy of introducing into a global\nphilosophical dialogue ideas that derive from Japanese, East Asian, or\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist traditions. The \u201cJapanese\nphilosophy\u201d of the Kyoto School is best understood as a\ncontribution to such an intercultural conversation, and not merely as\na reactive opposition to philosophical Eurocentrism or indeed\n\u201cphilosophical Euromonopolism.\u201d In any case, we must be\ncareful in how we understand the noun \u201cphilosophy\u201d and the\nmodifier \u201cJapanese\u201d when we speak of \u201cJapanese\nphilosophy\u201d (see Davis 2020b).\n\nAlthough the question of whether \u201cphilosophy\u201d existed in\nnon-Western traditions is today being intensely debated, with more and\nmore scholars referring not only to \u201cIndian philosophy\u201d\nand \u201cChinese philosophy\u201d but also to \u201cAfrican\nphilosophy\u201d and \u201cIndigenous philosophy,\u201d the Kyoto\nSchool philosophers themselves never doubted that\n\u201cphilosophy,\u201d in the literal and historically specific\nsense, is originally a cultural product of the Western tradition. But\nthey also recognize that it, like Western science and technology, has\nuniversal implications that can be developed by peoples around the\nglobe. This does not mean that they think Western philosophy is free\nof unrecognized cultural biases and limitations, or that traditional\nAsian traditions have nothing essential to offer the development of\nphilosophy in a post-Eurocentric world. They recognize the difference\nbetween the global potentialities and the still parochial actualities\nof philosophy, and their Japanese contributions aim to make philosophy\nmore, not less, worldly.\n\nIn an illuminating study of the debates surrounding the concept of\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d in Japan since the Meiji period\n(1868\u20131912), John Maraldo has isolated four senses in which the\nnotion of \u201cJapanese philosophy\u201d has been used: (1) Western\nphilosophy as it happens to be practiced by Japanese scholars; (2)\ntraditional Japanese thought (Confucian, Nativist, Buddhist, etc.) as\nit was formulated prior to the introduction of Western philosophy; (3)\na form of inquiry which has methods and themes that are Western in\norigin, but that can be applied to pre-modern, pre-Westernized,\nJapanese thinking; and (4) a kind of reverse Orientalism that asserts\nthe superiority of specifically Japanese ways of thinking.\n\nMaraldo argues for the superior viability of the third of these\nconceptions, in part because it pays due hermeneutical attention to\nthe Greek origins of the heretofore prevailing methods and themes of\n\u201cphilosophy.\u201d And yet, crucially, he also stresses that\nthe very methods and themes of philosophy are essentially always\n\u201cin the making,\u201d and that the production of\n\u201cJapanese philosophy\u201d will have to \u201cstrike a balance\nbetween reading (pre-defined) philosophy into [Japan\u2019s\ntraditional] texts and reading alternatives out of them, constructing\ncontrasts to that [pre-defined] philosophy [of the West]\u201d\n(Maraldo 2004, 238\u201344). The Kyoto School in particular can be\nunderstood to have taken up the challenge of critically and creatively\nappropriating philosophy so as to free up for questioning many of its\npre-defined Western conceptions.\n\nA text by Ueda on Nishitani\u2019s philosophy insightfully addresses\nthe question of the adjective \u201cJapanese\u201d as follows:\n\u201cIf we are to use the characterization \u2018Japanese\u2019,\nthis does not signify merely a particularity of Japan, but rather must\nbe understood in the sense that a certain area of universal primal\nhuman possibility has been historically realized particularly in\nJapan. Hence, \u2018European\u2019 does not straightaway mean\n\u2018global\u2019, but rather that a certain area of universal\nprimal human possibility has been historically realized particularly\nin Europe. \u2026 If we understand ourselves as the\nparticularization of something universal, this means, at the same\ntime, that we can understand others as different particularizations of\nsomething universal. Only then, with the communication between\nparticular and particular, can something universal come to be\nrealized\u201d (Ueda 1996, 309).\n\nIn this passage, which recalls Nishida\u2019s vision of communication\nbetween diversely determined branches of a shared yet essentially\nindeterminate root ur-culture, Ueda gives us a clue as to how we might\nbest understand the cross-cultural contributions of the Kyoto School.\nThey are philosophers who strive to express something universal from a\nparticular standpoint. But this does not at all mean that they attempt\nto reduce universality to their own particularity; for the latter is\nin turn understood as one particular expression of the formless\nur-culture, the indeterminate source of possibilities for individual\nand cultural determination, that is to say, the originary nothingness\nthat we all share. The Kyoto School thus presents us with a unique set\nof attempts to give philosophical form to this formless wellspring of\nboth commonality and singularity.\n\nThe degree to which the Kyoto School thinkers were successful in their\nboldly paradoxical quest to give philosophical form to the formless\ncan be debated. It is less easy to deny the exigency of the quest\nitself. If philosophy today is to mature beyond its Eurocentric and\neven \u201cEuromonopolistic\u201d pubescence (see Davis 2020b,\n28\u201333), then it is necessary to deepen its quest for\nuniversality by way of radically opening it up to a diversity of\ncultural perspectives. If cultural pluralism, for its part, is to\navoid falling into a relativistic antagonism or isolationism, it must\nentail a metamorphosis rather than an abandonment of the philosophical\nquest for universality (see Fujita 2013; Maraldo 2013). In any case,\nwe should understand the thought of the Kyoto School, not as a set of\nexclusively Japanese versions of philosophy, but rather as a set of\nJapanese contributions to the content of\u2014and indeed to the very\nformation of the forum of\u2014a global dialogue of \u201cworld\nphilosophy\u201d in the making.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Works by the Kyoto School", "Works on the Kyoto School", "Other Cited Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Works by the Kyoto School": ["</h3>\n<h4>Abbreviations Used in this Article</h4>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "NKC <em>Nishitani Keiji chosakush\u016b</em> [Collected Works of\nNishitani Keiji], Tokyo: S\u014dbunsha, 1986\u201395.
