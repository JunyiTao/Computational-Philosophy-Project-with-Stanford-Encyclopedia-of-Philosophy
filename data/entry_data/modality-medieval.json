    "preamble": "\n\nThere are four historical modal paradigms in ancient philosophy: the\nfrequency interpretation of modality, the model of possibility as a\npotency, the model of antecedent necessities and possibilities with\nrespect to a certain moment of time (diachronic modalities), and the\nmodel of possibility as non-contradictoriness. None of these habits of\nthought, which were well known in early medieval times through the\nworks of Boethius, was based on the idea of modality as involving\nreference to simultaneous alternatives. This new paradigm was\nintroduced into Western thought in early twelfth-century discussions\ninfluenced by Augustine\u2019s theological conception of God as\nacting by choice between alternative histories.\n\nWhile the new idea of associating modal terms with simultaneous\nalternatives was used also in thirteenth-century theology, it was not\noften discussed in philosophical contexts at that time. The increasing\nacceptance of Aristotle\u2019s philosophy gave support to traditional\nmodal paradigms, as is seen in Robert Kilwardby\u2019s influential\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s Prior Analytics, in which\nmodal syllogistic is treated as an essentialist theory of the\nstructures of being. There were analogous discussions of philosophical\nand theological modalities in Arabic philosophy. Arabic modal theories\ninfluenced Latin discussions mainly through the translations of\nAverroes\u2019s works.\n\nJohn Duns Scotus developed the model of modality as alternativeness\ninto a detailed theory. A logical possibility is something to which to\nbe is not repugnant, though it may not be compossible with other\npossibilities. Scotus\u2019s modal semantics influenced early\nfourteenth-century philosophy and theology in many ways.\nThirteenth-century essentialist assumptions were dropped from modal\nsyllogistic, the Aristotelian version of which was regarded as a\nfragmentary theory without a sufficient explication of the various\nfine structures of modal propositions. While the Aristotelian\nfrequency interpretation of modality was not found relevant in late\nmedieval logic, it continued to play a role in natural philosophy.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Aspects of Ancient Modal Paradigms\n\nIn speaking about the general features of the universe, ancient\nphilosophers were inclined to think that all generic possibilities\nwill be actualized, a habit of thinking called the principle of\nplenitude by Arthur O. Lovejoy (1936). Correspondingly, it was natural\nfor them to think that the invariant structures of reality are\nnecessary. This line of thought is found, e.g., in Plato\u2019s\ndoctrine of the ideas which are exhaustively imitated in the world by\nthe Demiurge, in Aristotle\u2019s theory of the priority of actuality\nover potentiality, in the Stoic doctrine of the rational world-order\nand the eternal cosmic cycles, as well as in Plotinus\u2019s\nmetaphysics of emanation (Knuuttila 1993).\n\nIn these approaches to the constituents of the universe, modal notions\ncould be understood in accordance with the so-called\n\u2018statistical\u2019 or \u2018temporal frequency\u2019 model of\nmodality where the meaning of modal terms is spelled out extensionally\nas follows: what is necessary is always actual, what is impossible is\nnever actual and what is possible is at least sometimes actual. The\nterm \u2018statistical interpretation of modality\u2019 was\nintroduced into the modern discussion by Oscar Becker (1952), and it\nhas been applied since in descriptions of certain ways of thinking in\nthe history of philosophy as well, particularly by Jaakko Hintikka\n(1973).\n\nEven though Aristotle did not define modal terms with the help of\nextensional notions, examples of this way of thinking can be found in\nhis discussion of eternal beings, the natures of things, the types of\nevents, and generic statements about such things. (See, for example,\nMetaphysics. IX.10.) Modal terms refer to the one and only\nworld of ours and classify the types of things and events on the basis\nof their actuality. This paradigm suggests that actualization is the\ngeneral criterion of the genuineness of possibilities, but the\ndeterministic implications of this view compelled Aristotle to seek\nways of speaking about unrealized singular possibilities. Diodorus\nChronus (fl. 300 BCE) was a determinist who found no problem in this\nway of thinking. Some commentators have argued that Aristotle\u2019s\nviews showing similarities to the statistical model are based on\nspecial metaphysical and ontological doctrines and not on his\nunderstanding of modal terms themselves. However, it is not clear that\nAristotle had any such distinction in mind. (For different\ninterpretations and evaluations of the role of this model in\nAristotle, see Hintikka 1973, Sorabji 1980, Seel 1982, Waterlow 1982a,\nvan Rijen 1989, Gaskin 1995.) In Posterior Analytics I.6,\nAristotle states that certain predicates may belong to their subjects\nat all times without belonging to them necessarily. Some ancient\ncommentators took this to mean that Aristotle operated with a\ndistinction between strong essential per se necessities and\nweak accidental necessities in the sense of non-essential invariances,\nsuch as inseparable accidents (see also Porphyry, Isagoge\n3.5\u20136), and that this distinction played an important role in\nhis modal syllogistic. See the commentaries on the Prior\nAnalytics by Alexander of Aphrodisias (36.25\u201332;\n201.21\u201324) and Philoponus (43.8\u201318; 126.7\u201329);\nFlannery 1995, 62\u201365, 99\u2013106. This was also the view of\nAverroes and some Latin authors in the Middle Ages. (See below,\nsection 3.)\n\nAnother Aristotelian modal paradigm was that of possibility as a\npotency. In Met. V.12 and IX.1 potency is said to be the\nprinciple of motion or change either as the activator or as the\nreceptor of a relevant influence. (For agent and patient in\nAristotle\u2019s natural philosophy in general, see Waterlow 1982b.)\nThe types of potency-based possibilities belonging to a species are\nrecognized as possibilities because of their actualization \u2014 no\nnatural potency type remains eternally frustrated. Aristotle says that\nwhen the agent and the patient come together and there is no\nhindrance, the one must act and the other must be acted on\n(Met. IX.5).\n\nIn De Caelo I.12 Aristotle supposes, per\nimpossibile, that a thing has contrary potencies, one of which is\nalways actualized. He argues that the alleged eternally unactualized\npotencies are not potencies at all because they cannot be assumed to\nbe realized at any time without contradiction. Aristotle applies here\nthe model of possibility as non-contradictoriness which is defined in\nPrior Analytics I.13 as follows: when a possibility is\nassumed to be realized, it results in nothing impossible. In speaking\nabout the assumed non-contradictory actualization of a possibility,\nAristotle thinks that it is realized in real history. Aristotle uses\nin De Caelo I.12 and in some other places (for example,\nMet IX.4, An. pr. I.15) a reductio argument\nwhich consists of assuming the denial of what is to be proved and\nshowing that this leads to a contradiction. The argument has created\nmuch controversy about how possibilities are supposed to obtain. See\nJudson 1983; Rini 2011, 135\u2013156; Rosen and Malink 2012; Smith\n2016.) \n\nAristotle refers to potencies in criticizing some of his\ncontemporaries who claimed that only that which takes place is\npossible (Met. IX.3). The model of possibility as potency\nprima facie allowed him to speak about all kinds of\nunrealized singular possibilities by referring to passive or active\npotencies, but taken separately they represent partial possibilities\nwhich do not guarantee that their actualization can take place. More\nis required for a real singular possibility, but when the further\nrequirements are added, such as a contact between the active and\npassive factor and the absence of an external hindrance, the potency\nmodel suggests that the potency can really be actualized only when it\nis actualized (Met. IX.5, Phys. VIII.1). It is\npossible that this led Aristotle to define motion\n(kin\u00easis) as the actuality of the potentiality (of the\nend) qua potentiality (Phys. III.1), but this did\nnot explain the possibility of beginning (Hintikka et al. 1977).\n\nIn discussing future contingent statements in In Chapter 9 of De\ninterpretatione, Aristotle says that what is, necessarily is when\nit is, but he then qualifies this necessity of the present with the\nremark that it does not follow that what is actual is necessary\nwithout qualification. If he meant that the temporal necessity of a\npresent event does not imply that such an event necessarily takes\nplace in circumstances of that type, this is an unsatisfactory\n\u2018statistical\u2019 attempt to avoid the problem that\nchangeability as a criterion of contingency makes all temporally\ndefinite singular events necessary (Hintikka 1973). Another\ninterpretation is that Aristotle wanted to show that the necessity of\nan event at a certain time does not imply that it would have been\nantecedently necessary. Aristotle discusses such singular diachronic\nmodalities in some places (Met. VI.3; EN III.5,\n1114a17\u201321; De int. 19a13\u201317) in which he seems\nto assume that the conditions which at\nt1 are necessary for p to\nobtain at a later time t2 are not\nnecessarily sufficient for this, although they might be sufficient for\nthe possibility (at t1) that\np obtains at t2. Aristotle\ndid not elaborate these ideas, which might have been his most\npromising attempt to formulate a theory of unrealized singular\npossibilities (for example  De int. 19a12\u201314. The\nimportance of this model is particularly stressed in Waterlow 1982a;\nsee also von Wright 1984; Weidemann 1986; Gaskin 1995.\n\nAristotle\u2019s conceptual difficulties can be seen from his various\nattempts to characterize the possibilities based on dispositional\nproperties such as heatable, separable, or countable. Analogous\ndiscussions were not unusual in later ancient philosophy. In\nPhilo\u2019s definition of possibility (ca. 300 BCE), the existence\nof a passive potency was regarded as a sufficient ground for speaking\nabout a singular possibility. The Stoics revised this definition by\nadding the condition of the absence of external hindrance, thinking\nthat otherwise the alleged possibility could not be realized.\nAccording to the deterministic world view of the Stoics, fate as a\nkind of active potency necessitates everything, but they did not\naccept the Master Argument of Diodorus Cronus for determinism, which\nwas meant to show that there cannot be possibilities which will not be\nrealized. The number of passive potencies with respect to a definite\nfuture instant of time is greater than what will be realized. As long\nas these possibilities are not prevented from being realized by being\nunactualized, they in some sense represent open possibilities.\nAlexander of Aphrodisias was influenced by the Stoic ideas of\ndiachronic modalities, but he thought that it was misleading to speak\nabout unrealized diachronic possibilities if everything is determined.\nHe argued for what he took to be Aristotle\u2019s view, namely that\nthere are undetermined prospective alternatives which remain open\noptions until the moment of time to which they refer. (See Sharples\n1983; Bobzien 1993, 1998; Hankinson 1998.) Neither Aristotle nor later\nancient thinkers had any considered conception of simultaneous\nalternatives. They thought that what is, necessarily is when it is,\nand that the alternative possibilities disappear when the future is\nfixed. Alexander\u2019s Peripatetic theory of alternative prospective\npossibilities could be characterized as the model of diachronic\nmodalities without simultaneous alternatives: there are transient\nsingular alternative possibilities, but those which will not be\nrealized vanish instead of remaining unrealized.\n\nAristotle often made use of indirect arguments from false or\nimpossible positions by adding hypotheses which he himself labeled as\nimpossible. In order to defend Aristotle\u2019s procedure against\nancient critics, Alexander of Aphrodisias characterized these\nhypotheses as impossibilities that were not nonsensical. (For this\ncontroversy, see Kukkonen 2002.) Some late ancient authors were\ninterested in impossible hypotheses as tools for conceptual analysis.\nIn the arguments which were called Eudemian procedures something\nimpossible was assumed in order to see what followed. The\nimpossibilities discussed in this way by Philoponus and Boethius show\nsimilarities with Porphyry\u2019s characterization of inseparable\naccidents as something which cannot occur separately but can be\nseparated in thought. These hypotheses were not regarded as\nformulations of possibilities in the sense of what could be actual;\nthey were counterpossible and not merely counterfactual (Martin\n1999).\n\nThere are several recent works on Aristotle\u2019s modal\nsyllogistics, but no generally accepted historical reconstruction\nwhich would make it a coherent theory. It was apparently based on\nvarious assumptions which were not fully compatible (Hintikka 1973;\nSmith 1989; Striker 2009). Some commentators have been interested in\nfinding coherent layers of the theory by explicating them in terms of\nAristotle\u2019s other views (van Rijen 1989; Patterson 1995). There\nare also several formal reconstructions such as Rini 2011 (modern\npredicate logic), Ebert and Nortmann 2007 (possible worlds semantics),\nand various set-theoretical approaches discussed in Johnson 2004 and\nMalink 2006, 2013 (mereological semantics).\n2. Early Medieval Developments\n\nEarly medieval thinkers were well acquainted with ancient modal\nconceptions through Boethius\u2019s works. One of the Aristotelian\nmodal paradigms occurring in Boethius is that of possibility as\npotency (potestas, potentia). According to Boethius,\nwhen the term \u2018possibility\u2019 (possibilitas) is\nused in the sense of \u2018potency\u2019, it refers to real powers\nor tendencies, the ends of which are either actual or non-actual at\nthe moment of utterance. Some potencies are never unrealized. They are\nsaid to be necessarily actual. When potencies are not actualized,\ntheir ends are said to exist potentially (In Periherm. II,\n453\u2013455). Necessarily actual potencies leave no room for the\npotencies of their contraries, for they would remain unrealized\nforever and the constitution of nature does not include elements which\nwould be in vain (In Periherm. II, 236). The potencies of\nnon-necessary features of being do not exclude contrary potencies.\nThey are not always and universally actualized, but as potency-types\neven these potencies are taken to satisfy the actualization criterion\nof genuineness (In Periherm. I, 120\u2013121; II, 237).\n\nBoethius\u2019s view that the types of potencies and potency based\npossibilities are sometimes actualized is in agreement with the\nAristotelian frequency interpretation of modality. This is another\nBoethian conception of necessity and possibility. He thought that\nmodal notions can be regarded as tools for expressing temporal or\ngeneric frequencies. According to the temporal version, what always\nis, is by necessity, and what never is, is impossible. Possibility is\ninterpreted as expressing what is at least sometimes actual.\nCorrespondingly, a generic property of a species is possible only if\nit is exemplified at least in one member of that species (In\nPeriherm. I, 120\u2013121, 200\u2013201; II, 237).\n\nLike Aristotle, Boethius often treated statement-making utterances as\ntemporally indeterminate sentences. The same sentence can be uttered\nat different times, and many of these temporally indeterminate\nsentences may sometimes be true and sometimes false, depending on the\ncircumstances at the moment of utterance. If the state of affairs the\nactuality of which makes the sentence true is omnitemporally actual,\nthe sentence is true whenever it is uttered. In this case, it is\nnecessarily true. If the state of affairs associated with an\nassertoric sentence is always non-actual, the sentence is always false\nand therefore impossible. A sentence is possible only if what is\nasserted is not always non-actual (I, 124\u2013125). Quasi-statistical\nideas are also employed in Ammonius\u2019s Greek commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s De interpretatione which shares some\nsources with Boethius\u2019s work (88.12\u201328) and in Alexander\nof Aphrodisias\u2019s commentary on Aristotle\u2019s modal\nsyllogistic. (See Mueller 1999, 23\u201331.)\n\nIn dealing with Chapter 9 of Aristotle\u2019s De\ninterpretatione, Boethius argues (II, 241) that because\n\n(1)\nM(pt & \u00ac pt)\n(1\u2032)\nIt is possible that p obtains at t and\nnot-p obtains at t\n\n\nis not acceptable, one should also deny\n\n(2)\npt & Mt \u00acpt\n(2\u2032)\np obtains at t and it is possible at t that not-p obtains at t.\n\n\nThe denial of (2) is equivalent to\n\n(3)\npt\u00a0\u2192\u00a0 Lt pt\n(3\u2032)\nIf p obtains at t then it is necessary at t that p obtains at t.\n\n\n(2) was generally denied in ancient philosophy and its denial was\ntaken as an axiom by Boethius as well. Correspondingly, (3) shows how\nthe necessity of the present was understood in ancient thought.\nBoethius thought that the temporal necessity of p can be\nqualified by shifting attention from temporally definite cases or\nstatements to their temporally indeterminate counterparts (I,\n121\u2013122; II, 242\u2013243; cf. Ammonius 153.24\u201326). This\nwas one of Boethius\u2019s interpretations of the Aristotelian\ndistinction between necessity now and necessity without qualification.\nBut he also made use of the diachronic model according to which the\nnecessity of p at t does not imply that, before\nt, it was necessary that p obtains at\nt.\n\nBoethius developed the diachronic ideas as part of his criticism of\nStoic determinism. If it is not true that everything is causally\nnecessitated, there must be genuine alternatives in the course of\nevents. Free choice was the source of contingency in which Boethius\nwas mainly interested, but he thought in addition that according to\nthe Peripatetic doctrine there is a real factor of indeterminacy in\nthe causal nexus of nature. When Boethius refers to chance, free\nchoice, and possibility in this context, his examples include\ntemporalized modal notions which refer to diachronic prospective\npossibilities at a given moment of time. A temporally determinate\nprospective possibility may not be realized at the time to which it\nrefers, in which case it ceases to be a possibility. Boethius did not\ndevelop the idea of simultaneous alternatives which would remain\nintact even when diachronic possibilities had vanished, insisting that\nonly what is actual at a certain time is at that time possible at that\ntime (cf. (3) above). But he also thought that there are objective\nsingular contingencies, so that the result of some prospective\npossibilities is indefinite and uncertain \u2018not only to us who\nare ignorant, but to nature\u2019 (In Periherm. I, 106, 120;\nII, 190\u2013192, 197\u2013198, 203, 207). (For Boethius\u2019s\nmodal conceptions, see Kretzmann 1985; Knuuttila 1993,\n45\u201362.)\n\nAs for the discussion of future contingent statements in De\ninterpretatione 9, Boethius\u2019s view shows similarities to\nthat of Ammonius, both authors apparently having known some similar\nGreek discussions. (Ammonius\u2019s Greek commentary on De\ninterpretatione is translated by D. Blank and Boethius\u2019s\ntwo Latin commentaries by N. Kretzmann in the same volume, with essays\nby R. Sorabji, N. Kretzmann and M. Mignucci, in 1998.) According to\nthe majority interpretation, Ammonius and Boethius ascribe to\nAristotle the view that the predictions of future contingent events\nand their denials differ from other contradictory pairs of\npropositions because truth and falsity are not definitely distributed\nbetween them. The propositions are consequently neither true nor\nfalse, but their disjunctions are necessary. This was characterized as\nbroad bivalence by Kretzmann 1987, 1998. (See also Frede 1985; Craig\n1988; Gaskin 1995.) Another interpretation holds that future\ncontingents are not definitely true or false in Boethius\u2019s view\nbecause their truth-makers are not yet determined, but are true or\nfalse in an indeterminate way. No qualification of the principle of\nbivalence is involved (Mignucci 1989, 1998; for a related\ninterpretation of Ammonius, see Seel 2000.) While most medieval\nthinkers regarded the latter view as true in theology, many of them\nthought that Aristotle\u2019s opinion was similar to the Boethian\nbroad bivalence. Peter Abelard and John Buridan were among those who\nread Aristotle as holding that future contingent propositions are true\nor false. Peter Auriol argued that these propositions lack a\ntruth-value; even God is aware of the future in a way which does not\nimply bivalence. This was an exceptional view. (See Normore 1982,\n1993; Lewis 1987; Schabel 2000; Knuuttila 2010.) Boethius, Aquinas,\nand many others thought that God can know future contingents only\nbecause the flux of time is present to divine eternity. Some late\nmedieval thinkers, for example John Duns Scotus and William of Ockham,\nfound the idea of atemporal presence of history to God problematic and\ntried to find other models for foreknowledge. These discussions led to\nthe so-called middle knowledge theory of the counterfactuals of\nfreedom (Craig 1988; Freddoso 1988; Dekker 2000).\n\nFrom the point of view of the history of modal thought, interesting\nthings took place in theology in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.\nAugustine had already criticized the application of the frequency\nmodel of possibility to divine power; for him, God has freely chosen\nthe actual world and its providential plan from alternatives which he\ncould have realized but did not will to do (potuit sed\nnoluit). This way of thinking differs from ancient philosophical\nmodal paradigms because the metaphysical basis is now the eternal\ndomain of simultaneous alternatives instead of the idea of one\nnecessary world order. In Augustine, God\u2019s eternal ideas of\nfinite beings represent the possibilities of how the highest being can\nbe imitated, the possibilities thus having an ontological foundation\nin God\u2019s essence. This was the dominating conception of\ntheological modal metaphysics until Duns Scotus departed from it. (See\nKnuuttila 2014, 86\u201389). The discrepancy between the Catholic doctrine\nof God\u2019s freedom and power and the philosophical modal\nconceptions was brought into the scope of discussion in the eleventh\ncentury. Peter Damian argued for the sovereignty of divine omnipotence\nin a way that is sometimes mistakenly taken to include the power to\nchange the past (Holopainen 1996). Anselm of Canterbury tried to\ndevelop a general modal semantics based on the notions of power and\npotentiality, with various conceptual distinctions (Knuuttila 2004).\nModal questions in philosophy and theology were developed in a more\nsophisticated way in twelfth-century considerations of God\u2019s\npower and providence and historical contingencies with the idea of\nsimultaneous alternatives. The idea of divine choice between\nalternatives was absent in Avicenna and Averroes, but it was defended\nby al-Ghazali, who criticized Avicenna\u2019s necessitarian metaphysics.\n(See Kukkonen 2000; for metaphysical necessitarianism in Arabic\nphilosophy, see Belo 2007; De Haan 2020.) \n\nEven though Abelard (1079\u20131142) sometimes made use of the\nBoethian modal concepts (as Anselm also did), he was interested in the\nphilosophical significance of the idea of modality as alternativeness.\nAssuming that what is actual is temporally necessary at a certain\npoint of time as no longer avoidable, he adds that unrealized\ncounterfactual alternatives are possible at the same time in the sense\nthat they could have happened at that time. There are also merely\nimaginable alternatives, such as Socrates\u2019s being a bishop,\nwhich never had a real basis in things. (See Martin 2001, 2003;\nMarenbon 2007, 156\u2013158, is sceptical about this interpretation;\nsee also Binini 2019.) Gilbert of Poitiers (d. 1154) stressed the idea\nthat natural regularities which are called natural necessities are not\nabsolute, since they are freely chosen by God and can be overridden by\ndivine power. This basically Augustinian conception was a widespread\ntheological view in the twelfth century. In explaining Plato\u2019s\n\u2018Platonitas\u2019 Gilbert innovatively argues that this\nincludes all that Plato was, is and will be as well as what he could\nbe but never is (The Commentaries on Boethius\n144.77\u201378, 274.75\u201376; Knuuttila 1993, 75\u201382).\n\nAn interesting early thirteenth-century philosophical analysis of\nAugustinian modalities was put forward by Robert Grosseteste (d. 1253;\nLewis 1996). Grosseteste taught that while things are primarily called\nnecessary or possible \u2018from eternity and without\nbeginning\u2019 with respect to God\u2019s eternal knowledge, there\nare necessities and impossibilities with a beginning in God\u2019s\nprovidence which are eternal contingencies in the sense that God could\nhave chosen their opposites (De libero arbitrio\n168.26\u2013170.33, 178.24\u201329). One of the theses of\ntwelfth-century authors, later called nominales, was that\n\u2018What is once true is always true\u2019. It was argued that\nwhile tensed statements about temporally definite singular events have\na changing truth-value, the corresponding non-tensed propositions are\nunchangingly true or false, without being necessarily true or false\nfor this reason (Nuchelmans 1973, 177\u2013189; Iwakuma and Ebbesen\n1992). This was in agreement with Abelard\u2019s view that future\ncontingent propositions are true or false. The actuality of a\ncontingent state of affairs at a specified future time does not\nexclude the non-temporalized possibility of simultaneous alternatives,\nnor does the truth of a proposition about this state of affairs make\nit necessary (Abelard, Glossae super Peri hermeneias IX,\n520\u2013577; see also Peter of Poitiers (d. 1205),\nSententiae I.7.133\u201343, I.12.164\u2013223, I.14,\n328\u2013353).\n3. Modalities in Thirteenth-Century Logical Treatises\n\nModifying Boethius\u2019s systematization of Aristotle\u2019s\nremarks in De interpretatione 12 and 13, twelfth- and\nthirteenth-century logicians often presented the equipollences between\nmodal terms and opposed relations between modal propositions with the\nhelp of the following diagram:\n\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nThe square could be taken to refer to modals de dicto or\nsingular modals de re (see below.) Abelard tried to define\nthe opposed relations between quantified de re modals as\nwell, mistakenly thinking that these were the same as those between\nsingular modal propositions (Glossae super Perihermeneias\nXII, 468\u2013471, 530\u2013544). This question was not much\ndiscussed before its satisfactory solution in fourteenth-century modal\nsemantics. (See Hughes 1989 and his description of Buridan\u2019s\noctagon of modal opposites and equipollences.) While\npossibile and contingens are treated as synonyms in\nthe figure, it became more usual to associate the former with\none-sided possibility (not impossible) and the latter with two-sided\npossibility (neither necessary nor impossible).  \n\nThe anonymous Dialectica Monacensis (ca. 1200) is one of the\nnumerous works representing the new terminist approach to logic and\ncan be used as an example of how modalities were treated in it. (A\ncollection of late twelfth- and early thirteenth-century logical texts\nis edited in de Rijk 1962\u201367.) In discussing the quantity\n(universal, particular, singular) and quality (affirmative, negative)\nof the modals, the author states that modal terms may be adverbial or\nnominal. The modal adverb qualifies the copula, and the structure of\nthe sentence can be described as follows:\n\n(4)\nquantity/subject/modalized copula/predicate (for example: Some A\u2019s are necessarily B)\n\n\nIn this form, the negation can be located in different places,\neither\n\n(5)\nquantity/subject/copula modalized by a negated mode/predicate (for example: Some A\u2019s are-not-necessarily B)\n\n\nor\n\n(6)\nquantity/subject/modalized negative copula/predicate (for example: Some A\u2019s are-necessarily-not B)\n\n\nThe modal sentences with nominal modes can be read in two ways. One\ncan apply an adverbial type of reading to them, which is said to be\nhow Aristotle treats modal sentences in the Prior Analytics.\nThe quality and quantity of such a de re modal sentence is\ndetermined by the corresponding non-modal sentence. In a de\ndicto modal sentence that which is asserted in a non-modal\nsentence is considered as the subject about which the mode is\npredicated. When modal sentences are understood in this way, they are\nalways singular, their form being:\n\n(7)\nsubject/copula/mode (for example: That some A\u2019s are B is necessary.)\n\n\nThis reading is said to be the one which Aristotle presented in De\ninterpretatione (De Rijk 1967, II-2, 479.35\u2013480.26). The\nidea of the systematic distinction between the readings de\ndicto (in sensu composito) and de re (in\nsensu diviso) of modally qualified statements was employed in\nAbelard\u2019s investigations of modal statements (Glossae super\nPerihermeneias XII, 3\u2013106; Dialectica\n191.1\u2013210.19). Independently of Abelard, the distinction was\noften used, as in the Dialectica Monacensis, in discussions\nof the composition-division ambiguity of sentences. (See also\nMaier\u00f9 1972, ch. 5; Jacobi 1980, ch. 4.)\n\nFollowing Boethius, many authors referred to a modal distinction based\non a triple matter of assertoric sentences, namely natural,\ncontingent, or remote. In a sentence of natural matter, the predicate\nbelongs essentially to the subject or is its proprium, in contingent\nmatter, the predicate may belong or not belong to the subject, and in\nremote matter, the predicate cannot belong to the subject. See, for\nexample, Peter of Spain, Tractatus, p. 7; Dialectica\nMonacensis 472.9\u2013473.22. According to Garland the Computist (11th\ncentury), the opposite universal sentences of contingent matter are\nboth false and the opposite particular sentences are both true\n(Dialectica, 54.21\u201330; 82.25\u201330). The same division of the\nsentences of contingent matter based on the frequency interpretation\nof contingency is found in Aquinas (In Periherm. I.13, 168).\nSee also Boethius, In Periherm. II, 177.18\u2013178.8;\n303.15\u2013306.13; 325.8\u201315. Another often discussed theme was the\ndistinction between modalities per se and per\naccidens, which was based on the idea that the modal status of a\ntemporally indefinite sentence may be changeable or not; for example,\n\u2018You have not been in Paris\u2019 may begin to be impossible,\nwhereas \u2018You either have or have not been in Paris\u2019 may\nnot. (See, for example, William of Sherwood, Introduction to\nLogic, 41). Another distinction between sentences necessary\nper se and per accidens was based on\nAristotle\u2019s theory of per se predication in\nPosterior Analytics I.4. A sentence was said to be\naccidentally necessary when it was unchangeably true but, as distinct\nfrom per se predications, there was no necessary conceptual\nconnection between subject and predicate. This became an important\npart of thirteenth-century interpretations of Aristotle\u2019s modal\nsyllogistics. (See, for example, Robert Kilwardby\u2019s Notule\nlibri Priorum 8.133\u2013142; 40.162\u2013174.)\n\nOne example of the prevalence of the traditional use of modal notions\ncan be found in the early medieval de dicto/de re analysis of\nexamples such as \u2018A standing man can sit\u2019. It was commonly\nstated that the composite (de dicto) sense is \u2018It is\npossible that a man sits and stands at the same time\u2019 and that\non this reading the sentence is false. The divided (de re)\nsense is \u2018A man who is now standing can sit\u2019 and on this\nreading the sentence is true. Many authors formulated the divided\npossibility as follows: \u2018A standing man can sit at another\ntime\u2019. It was assumed that a possibility refers to an\nactualization in the one and only world history and that it cannot\nrefer to the present moment because of the necessity of the present\nunderstood in the Aristotelian sense formulated in (2) and (3) above.\nWhen authors referred to another time, they thought that the\npossibility will be realized at that time or that the divided\npossibility refers to the future even though it may remain unrealized.\nThose who made use of the (at that time modern) idea of simultaneous\nalternatives took the composite reading to refer to one and the same\nstate of affairs and the divided reading to simultaneous alternative\nstates of affairs. This analysis was also applied to the question of\nwhether God\u2019s knowledge of things makes them necessary\n(Knuuttila 1993, 118\u2013121).\n\nA great deal of Abelard\u2019s logical works consisted of discussions\nof topics, consequences and conditionals. Like Boethius, Abelard\nthought that true conditionals express necessary connections between\nthe antecedents and the consequents. He argued that inseparability and\nentailment between the truth of the antecendent and consequent are\nrequired for the truth of a conditional. Some twelfth-century masters\nregarded the principle that the antecedent is not true without the\nconsequent as a sufficient condition for the truth of a conditional\nand accepted the so-called paradoxes of implication. The question of\nthe nature of conditionals and consequences remained a popular theme\nin medieval logic (Martin 1987, 2012).\n\nThe principles of propositional modal logic, found in Prior\nAnalytics I.15, were generally expressed as follows: if the\nantecedent of a valid consequence is possible/necessary, the\nconsequent is possible/necessary (Abelard, Dialectica\n202.6\u20138). However, the main interest was in modal syllogistic\nand modal predicate logic. Avicenna (d. 1037) wrote a brief Arabic\nsummary of Aristotle\u2019s modal syllogistic, but his own theory was\ndifferent, being based on the assumptions that the subject terms and\nthe predicate terms of assertoric and modal propositions stand for all\npossible applications and the truth-conditions of assertoric\npropositions and corresponding possibility propositions are the same.\nIt follows, for example, that syllogisms with assertoric premises\ncoincide with uniform possibility syllogisms (Street 2002, 2005;\nLagerlund 2009). Avicenna was particularly interested in relative\nnecessities and distinguished between various types of conditional\nnecessities in terms of temporal determinations. Later Arabic works on\nmodal theories were much influenced by Avicenna. (See Strobino and\nThom 2016.) While Averroes\u2019s commentaries on the Prior\nAnalytics followed the main lines of Aristotle\u2019s text, his\nseparate treatise on modality involved new systematic ideas, mainly\nthe theory of accidental and per se necessary terms and the\ninterpretation of syllogistic necessity premises as per se\nnecessary predications with per se necessary terms. Both\nideas were inspired by Aristotle\u2019s remarks in the Posterior\nAnalytics I.4. Since Averroes took modal premises to be of the\ndivided type, assertoric premises in Aristotelian mixed\nnecessity-assertoric syllogisms must have a predicate term which is\nnecessary. The same applies to the subject term of the first premise\nin mixed assertoric-necessity syllogisms (Quaesita octo in librum\nPriorum Analyticorum, IV.3, 84, in Aristotelis Opera cum\nAverrois Commentariis I.2b; see also Thom 2003, 81\u201385).\nThis is a speculative explanation of Aristotle\u2019s asymmetric\ntreatment of mixed necessity-assertoric syllogisms and mixed\nassertoric-necessity syllogisms. Gersonides later tried to develop\nfurther Averroes\u2019s remarks; see Manekin 1992. Analogous\nessentialist ideas were developed in thirteenth-century Latin\ndiscussions. \n\nThe first Latin commentary on the Prior Analytics is an\nanonymous late twelfth-century treatise (\u2018Anonymus Aurelianensis\nIII\u2019) which involves detailed discussions of modal conversion\nand modal syllogisms as well as many problems dealt with in ancient\ncommentaries. (See Ebbesen 2008; an edition by Thomsen Th\u00f6rnqvist\nin 2015.). Dialectica Monacensis\ninvolves a brief summary of Aristotle\u2019s modal syllogistic the\nelements of which were discussed in logic courses in Paris in the\nfirst part of the thirteenth century. Robert Kilwardby\u2019s\ncommentary Notule libri Priorum (c. 1240) became an\nauthoritative work from which the discussions of modal syllogisms in\nthe commentaries of Albert the Great (ca. 1250) and many others were\nlargely derived. Abelard, who did not\ndeal with Aristotle\u2019s modal syllogistic, said that the modals in\nmixed syllogisms with both modal and assertoric premises should be\nunderstood in a way which he elsewhere characterizes as de re\ninterpretation (Glossae super Perihermeneias XII,\n189\u2013203). This reading of modal premises was often assumed,\nalthough it was seldom discussed as such. A central problem of\nAristotle\u2019s theory is that the structure of the premises is not\nanalyzed. Even if it is natural to think that the presupposition of\nthe mixed moods is a de re reading of modally qualified\npremises, this creates difficulties when applied to the conversion\nrules, most of which are unproblematic only if understood as rules for\nmodals de dicto. (According to Aristotle, necessity premises\nare converted in the same way as assertoric premises:\n\u2018Every/some A is B\u2019 implies \u2018Some B is A\u2019 and\n\u2018No A is B\u2019 implies \u2018No B is A\u2019. Affirmative\ncontingency premises are converted to corresponding negative\ncontingency premises and both these by the conversion of terms to\nparticular contingency propositions; Prior Analytics I.3,\n13.)\n\nWhile many historians think that Aristotle\u2019s modal syllogistic\nincluded incompatible elements, this was not the view of\nmid-thirteenth century logicians. Many of them discussed the same\nalleged counter-examples to the universal convertibility of necessary\npropositions, such as\n\n(8)\nEverything healthy (or awake) is necessarily an animal.\n\n\nRobert Kilwardby\u2019s explanation is based on the view that\nconvertible necessity premises are necessity propositions per\nse and not per accidens, like (8), which are not\nconvertible. (See Notule libri Priorum 8.133\u2013146.) In\naffirmative necessity propositions per se, the subject is\nper se connected to the predicate. In negative necessity\npropositions per se, the subject is per se\nincompatible with the predicate. The terms in per se\ninherences or incompatibilities are essential and necessarily stand\nfor the things they signify. The historical background of\nKilwardby\u2019s interpretation is not clear; it does show\nsimilarities to Averroes\u2019s discussion mentioned above, but there\nwas no historical link. (See Lagerlund 2000, 25\u201342; Thom 2007,\n19\u201328.)\n\nAs for the conversion of contingency propositions (neither necessary\nnor impossible), Kilwardby notes that while the converted propositions\nof indefinite (utrumlibet) contingency are of the same type\nof contingency, the conversion of natural contingency propositions\n(true about most cases) results in contingency propositions when\ncontingency means possibility proper (not impossible). There were\nextensive discussions of the kinds of contingency based on various\nphilosophical ideas in Kilwardby, Albert the Great and their\ncontemporaries (Knuuttila 2008, 540\u2013541).\n\nKilwardby follows Aristotle\u2019s remark that \u2018A contingently\nbelongs to B\u2019 may mean either \u2018A contingently belongs to\nthat to which B belongs\u2019 or \u2018A contingently belongs to\nthat to which B contingently belongs\u2019, Notule libri\nPriorum 18.682\u2013697. Kilwardby argues that the subject terms\nin contingency syllogisms are read in the second way and ampliated, if\nsyllogistic relations do not demand restrictions. In explaining the\ndifference in this respect between necessity propositions and\ncontingency propositions, he states that since the terms in per\nse necessity propositions are essential, \u2018Every A is\nnecessarily B\u2019 and \u2018Whatever is necessarily A is\nnecessarily B\u2019 behave in the same way in logic. Contingency\npropositions which are ampliated do not mean the same as those which\nare not ampliated (Notule libri Priorum 18.187\u2013207;\n18.653\u2013672). For the conversion of both types of contingency\npropositions and the role of the distinction between essential and\naccidental terms in defining the truth conditions of contingency\npropositions, see Thom 2019, 139\u2013149. In the conversion of \nde re readings of unampliated contingency propositions, the\npossibility changes into actuality, which is in agreement with the\nfrequency interpretation of modality.\n\nAccording to Kilwardby, the modal character of the predication in the\nconclusion of the perfect first figure syllogism follows from the\nfirst premise, which involves the whole syllogism in accordance with\nthe dici de omni et nullo (Lagerlund 2000, 41\u201342). The\npremises and the conclusion in uniform necessity syllogisms are\nnecessary per se. In mixed first-figure syllogisms with a\nmajor necessity premise and a minor asertoric premise, the\nnon-modalized premise should be simpliciter assertoric, i.e.,\na necessarily true per se predication. Similarly, in mixed\nfirst-figure syllogisms with contingent major and assertoric minor\npremises, the assertoric premise must be simpliciter\nassertoric, but this time the criteria are that the predicate belongs\nto the subject per se, invariably or by natural contingency\n(Notule libri Priorum 15.255\u2013301;\n20.706\u2013736).\n\nKilwardby explains that in first-figure mixed necessity-assertoric\nsyllogisms the necessity premise appropriates to itself a minor which\nis necessary per se; no such appropriation occurs in\nfirst-figure mixed assertoric-necessity syllogisms. There are similar\nappropriation rules for some mixed second-figure and third-figure\nmoods with assertoric and necessity premises and for various mixed\ncontingency moods pertaining to the kind of appropriated contingency\npremises or assertoric premises (Thom 2007, chs. 5\u20136).\n\nKilwardby and his followers regarded Aristotle\u2019s modal\nsyllogistic as the correct theory of modalities, the explication of\nwhich demanded various metaphysical considerations. As exemplified by\nthe appropriation rules, they assumed that propositions of the same\nform had different interpretations, depending on how they were related\nto other propositions in a syllogism. From the logical point of view,\nthese rules have an ad hoc character. (For some comparisons\nbetween contemporary philosophical modal logic and thirteenth-century\nviews, see also Uckelman 2009.) Thirteenth-century Aristotelian\nauthors generally assumed that modalities had a metaphysical\nfoundation in the hierarchical order of the nature of things that\ndetermined their occurrences in the temporal order accountable by\nfrequential modalities. This was the background of the popular\nAverroist classification of necessary and contingent causes in natural\nphilosophy (Knuuttila 1993, 129\u2013137). Following a twelfth-century\ndistinction, theologians divided between God\u2019s absolute power\nlimited by contradiction and God\u2019s ordained power as the first\nprinciple of the existing order (Moonan 1994; Gelber 2004, 309\u2013349).\n\n\nAfter Kilwardby and Albert the Great, who retailed him, several\nthirteenth-century authors wrote treatises on the Prior\nAnalytics. Ebbesen (2010) lists seven literal and six question\ncommentaries from the 1270s through the 1290s. One of these has been\nrecently edited, namely the question commentary of Radulphus Brito\n(2017). On the basis of the lists of the contents of the question\ncommentaries included in Ebbesen 2010, one can characterize this as a\nKilwardbian tradition. While Richard Campsall\u2019s early\nfourteenth-century Questions on Aristotle\u2019s Prior\nAnalytics was influenced by this literature, it also involved\nsome new modal ideas. Campsall thinks that one should discuss de\ndicto and de re modalities separately. In considering\nthe syllogistic logic of de re possibility statements with\nterms standing for actual things, he says that an affirmative de\nre possibility statement as of now implies the corresponding\nassertoric statement (5.40) and a negative assertoric statement as of\nnow implies the corresponding de re necessity statement\n(5.50). It follows that what is possible now is actualized and things\ncannot be otherwise because all true present tense negative statements\nare necessarily true. This is Campsall\u2019s version of the\ntraditional doctrine of the necessity of the present. But if the\ndenial of a present affirmative statement is necessary, how can the\nstatement itself be non-necessary? Campsall defines a de re\ncontingency statement as a conjunction of an affirmative and\ncorresponding negative possibility proper statement (7.34\u201336).\nPerhaps he thought that this is applicable to present tense statements\nwith actual terms and imply the idea of simultaneous alternatives, as\nsuggested by Lagerlund 2000, 87\u201390. But Campsall also equates\nde re necessity with respect to actual things to unchanging\npredication and contingency to changing predication. Actual things may\nbe contingent in the sense that they will be changed in the future\n(12.31). For Campshall\u2019s confusing formulations, see also\nKnuuttila 2018.\n4. Fourteenth-Century Discussions\n\nJohn Duns Scotus\u2019s theory of simultaneous alternatives was an\nexposition of the intensional theory of modality, some elements of\nwhich were put forward in the twelfth century. In criticizing Henry of\nGhent\u2019s theory of theological modalities, Scotus sketched a\nmodel of \u2018divine psychology\u2019 in which certain relations\nbetween theological, metaphysical, and modal theoretical notions are\ndefined. Scotus deviated from the metaphysical tradition in which\npossibilities were founded in divine being. According to him, when God\nas an omniscient being knows all possibilities, he does not know them\nby turning first to his essence. Possibilities can be known in\nthemselves (Ord. I.35, 32). In fact they would be what they\nare even if there were no God. Scotus states that if it is assumed\nthat, per impossibile, neither God nor the world exists and\nthe proposition \u2018The world is possible\u2019 then existed, this\nproposition would be true. The actual world is possible as it is, and\nthis possibility and the possibilities of unrealized things are\nprimary metaphysical facts which are not dependent on anything else\n(Ord. I.7.1, 27; Lect. I.7, 32, I.39.1\u20135, 49).\nThe commentators are divided on whether Scotus speaks here about\npossibilities as such (Knuuttila 1996) or about the independence of\nformal possibilities, but not of concrete possibilities, which are\ndependent on God (Normore 2003; Hoffmann 2009).\n\nScotus calls the propositional elements of the modal domain\n\u2018logical possibilities\u2019. These express things and states\nof affairs to which it is not repugnant to be. Possibilities as such\nhave no kind of existence of their own nor are they causally\nsufficient for the existence of anything, but they form the\nprecondition for everything that is or can be. God\u2019s omniscience\ninvolves an actually infinite number of intelligibles (De primo\nprincipio IV.9, 68\u201369); as an object of divine knowledge, they\nreceive an intelligible or objective being. As an object of divine\nomnipotence, they receive an intentional possible being. Some of these\nare included in God\u2019s providential plan of creation and will\nreceive an actual being. The description of how things could be at a\ncertain moment consists of compossible possibilities. Though\npossibilities necessarily are what they are, the actualization of\nnon-necessary possibilities is contingent. Since all finite things are\ncontingently actual, their alternatives are possible with respect to\nthe same time, though these are not compossible with what is actual.\nImpossibilities are incompossibilities between possibilities\n(Ord. I.35, 32, 49\u201351, I.38, 10, I.43, 14;\nLect. I.39.1\u20135, 62\u201365).\n\nIn criticizing extensional modal theories, Scotus redefined a\ncontingent event as follows: \u2018I do not call something contingent\nbecause it is not always or necessarily the case, but because its\nopposite could be actual at the very moment when it occurs\u2019\n(Ord. I.2.1.1\u20132, 86). This is a denial of the\ntraditional thesis of the necessity of the present and the temporal\nfrequency characterization of contingency. In Scotus\u2019s modal\nsemantics, the meaning of the notion of contingency is spelt out by\nconsidering simultaneous alternatives. What is actual is contingently\nso if, instead of being actual, it could be not actual. This\nconception of simultaneous contingent alternatives is part of an\nargument that the first cause does not act necessarily. According to\nScotus, the eternal creative act of divine will is free only if it\ncould be other than it is in a real sense (Lect.\nI.39.1\u20135, 58). For Scotus\u2019s modal theory, see also\nHonnefelder 1990; Vos et al. 1994; King 2001; Hoffmann 2002; the\nthesis of Scotus\u2019s innovativeness is criticized in Pasnau\n2020.\n\nScotus\u2019s approach to modalities brought new themes into\nphilosophical discussion. One of these was the idea of possibility as\na non-existent precondition of all being and thinking. Some of his\nfollowers and critics argued that if there were no God, there would\nnot be any kind of modality (see Hoffmann 2002, Coombs 2004; for\nBradwardine\u2019s criticism, see Frost 2014). Scotus\u2019s views\nwere known in the seventeenth century through the works of\nSu\u00e1rez and some Scotist authors (Honnefelder 1990). In his\ndiscussion of eternal truths, Descartes criticized the classical view\nof the ontological foundation of modality as well as the Scotist\ntheory of modality and conceivability. (There are different\ninterpretations of Descartes\u2019s view of the foundations of\nmodality and how it is related to late medieval discussions; see\nAlanen 1990; Normore 1991, 2006.)\n\nAnother influential idea was the distinction between logical and\nnatural necessities and possibilities. In Scotus\u2019s theory,\nlogically necessary attributes and relations are attached to things in\nall those sets of compossibilities in which they occur. Against this\nbackground one could ask which of the natural invariances treated as\nnecessities in earlier natural philosophy were necessary in this\nstrong sense of necessity, and which of them were merely empirical\ngeneralizations without being logically necessary. (For a discussion\nof logical and natural necessities in the fourteenth century, see\nKnuuttila 1993, 155\u2013160, 2001a.) Buridan distinguished between\nlogical and natural necessities in his classification of four grades\nof necessity (Dialectica 8.6.3). He used a non-extensional\nmetaphysical notion of possibility sencundum imaginationen in\nhis questions on Aristotle\u2019s Physics (Sylla 2001), but\na frequency interpretation in his questions on Aristotle\u2019s\nOn generation and corruption I.4 (57). This was the main\nmodal conception in the Averroist Aristotle commentaries by John of\nJandun (see, for example, his questions on Metaphysics, IX.5\n114va-b; questions on On the Heavens I.34, 21vb) and remained\na popular option until the Renaissance times (Knebel 2003). \n\nOne important branch of medieval logic developed in treatises called\nDe obligationibus dealt, roughly speaking, with how an\nincreasing set of true and false propositions might remain coherent in\na disputation. According to thirteenth-century rules, a false present\ntense statement could be accepted as a starting point only if it was\ntaken to refer to a moment of time different from the actual one.\nScotus deleted this rule, based on the Aristotelian axiom of the\nnecessity of the present, and later theories accepted the Scotist\nrevision. In this new form, obligations logic could be regarded as a\ntheory of how to analyze possible states of affairs and their mutual\nrelationships. These discussions influenced the philosophical theory\nof counterfactual conditionals (Yrj\u00f6nsuuri 1994, 2001; Gelber\n2004; Dutilh Novaes 2007).\n\nIn dealing with counterfactual hypotheses of indirect proofs mentioned\nabove, Averroes and Thomas Aquinas made use of the idea of abstract\npossibilities which did not imply the idea of alternative domains. The\npossibilities of a thing can be dealt with at various levels which\ncorrespond to Porphyrian predicables. Something which is possible for\na thing as a member of a genus can be impossible for it as a member of\na species. The same holds of it as a member of a species and an\nindividuated thing. Thus humans can fly because there are other\nanimals which can fly. These abstract possibilities are impossible in\nthe sense that they cannot be actualized. Buridan heavily criticized\nthis approach from the point of view of his modal theory. He argued\nthat if a counterfactual state of affairs is possible, it can be\ncoherently imagined as actual. If something cannot be treated in this\nway, calling it possible is based on conceptual confusion. (See\nKnuuttila and Kukkonen 2011.) While Scotus, Buridan and many others\nunderstood the basic level of possibility in terms of semantic\nconsistency, Ockham wanted to preserve the link to the notion of power\nin his modal considerations, thinking that necessity is actuality plus\nimmutability, the past and the present are necessary, and Scotus was\nwrong in assuming that things could be different from how they are at\nthe very moment of their actuality (Normore 2016). \n\nInfluenced by the new ideas about logical modality, William of Ockham\n(Summa logicae), John Buridan (Tractatus de\nconsequentiis, Summulae de Dialectica) and some other\nfourteenth-century authors could formulate the principles of modal\nlogic much more completely and satisfactorily than did their\npredecessors. Questions of modal logic were discussed separately with\nrespect to modal propositions de dicto and de re;\nmodal propositions de re were further divided into two groups\ndepending on whether the subject terms refer to actual or possible\nbeings. It was thought that logicians should also analyze the\nrelationships between these readings and, furthermore, the\nconsequences having various types of modal sentences as their parts.\nOckham, Buridan and their followers largely dropped thirteenth-century\nessentialist assumptions from modal syllogistic. They regarded the\nAristotelian version as a fragmentary theory in which the distinctions\nbetween different types of fine structures were not explicated and,\nconsequently, did not try to reconstruct Aristotle\u2019s modal\nsyllogistic as a consistent whole by one unifying analysis of modal\npropositions; they believed, like some modern commentators, that such\nreconstruction was not possible. (For fourteenth-century modal logic,\nsee King 1985; Lagerlund 2000; Thom 2003; Knuuttila 2008,\n551\u2013567; Read 2021.)\n\nAccording to Hughes (1989), one could supply a Kripke-style possible\nworlds semantics to Buridan\u2019s modal system. This is done in\nJohnston 2015. In discussing the conception of simultaneous\nalternativeness in fourteenth-century logic, many historians have used\nthe terminology of possible worlds semantics without the metaphysical\nand formal details of the modern theory (Yrj\u00f6nsuuri 1994,\n167\u2013174; Dutilh Novaes 2007, 90\u201391; Read 2021. Ockham and Buridan\nstate that the truth of \u2018A white thing can be black\u2019\ndemands the truth of \u2018This can be black\u2019 and that\n\u2018This can be black\u2019 and \u2018\u2018This is black\u2019\nis possible\u2019 mean the same. Compound (de dicto) and\ndivided (de re) readings do not differ at this level, but are\nseparated in dealing with universal and particular propositions. While\nOckham did not discuss unrestricted divided necessity propositions,\nBuridan took the subject terms of all quantified divided modal\npropositions as standing for possible beings if they are not\nrestricted. The truth of these propositions demands the truth of all\nor some relevant singular propositions of the type just mentioned; the\ndemonstrative pronoun is then taken to refer to the possible beings\neven though they may not exist. Buridan could have said that the\npossible truth of \u2018This is X\u2019 means that it is true in a\npossible state of affairs in which the possible being referred to by\n\u2018this\u2019 occurs and that the necessary truth of \u2018This\nis X\u2019 means that it is true in all possible states of affairs in\nwhich the possible being referred to by \u2018this\u2019 occurs\n(Hughes 1989). For Buridan\u2019s modal logic, see also Read\u2019s\nintroduction to Treatise on Consequences (2015); Johnston\n2021. \n The new modal logic was among the most remarkable achievements of\nmedieval logic. Buridan\u2019s modal logic was dominant in late\nmedieval times, being more systematic than that of Ockham because of\nits symmetric treatment of possibility and necessity. It was embraced\nby Marsilius of Inghen, Albert of Saxony, Jodocus Trutfetter and\nothers (Lagerlund 2000, 184\u2013227; for the later influence of\nmedieval modal theories, see also Coombs 2003; Knebel 2003; Roncaglia\n1996, 2003; Schmutz 2006). The rise of the new modal logic was\naccompanied by elaborated theories of epistemic logic (Boh 1993) and\ndeontic logic (Knuuttila and Hallamaa 1995).\n",
