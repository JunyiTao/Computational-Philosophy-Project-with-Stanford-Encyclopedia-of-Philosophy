    "main_text": "Libertarian Paternalism || Definitional issues\n4.1 Definitional issues\n\nWhy is the view labeled by its introducers as Libertarian Paternalism?\nIn the paradigmatic definitions of nudging the intervention is always\nby way of what is called \u201cchoice architecture.\u201d Choice\narchitecture is the design of different ways in which choices can be\npresented to an agent. Examples include the number of choices, whether\nthe choice is opt-in or opt-out, the way in which alternatives are\ndescribed or presented, the incentives attached to the choices,\netc.\n\nTheir view is Libertarian because it preserves freedom of choice. No\nchoice is eliminated or made more difficult. Nobody is coerced. The\nchoice set remains the same. No significant costs or incentives are\nattached to the choices the agent faces.\n\nTheir view is Paternalistic because it seeks to promote the good of\nthe agent being nudged. And it is the good as viewed by the agent\nherself. We are not nudging towards ends she does not hold. Nudging is\nabout means not ends.\n\nTheir definition of Paternalism is very weak in the sense that it\nallows many more acts to count as paternalistic than would be under\nalmost all traditional definitions of paternalism.\n\nIn terms of the analysis of Paternalism given in this entry is Nudging\npaternalistic? The first condition in the definition is: the action\n(or its omission) interferes with the liberty or autonomy of Y.\nNothing corresponds to this in the definition above. Putting a warning\nlabel on a cigarette pack does not interfere with the liberty of\nautonomy of any cigarette smoker.\n\nBasically, the definition of paternalism in Libertarian Paternalism is\nfocused solely on the fact that nudges are being used to make the\nagents being nudged better off. We could replace\n\u201cpaternalism\u201d with \u201cbenevolence\u201d and nothing\nimportant would be left out since the \u201clibertarian\u201d aspect\npicks up everything else that is significant. Whether this expansion\nof the definition of paternalism is warranted or not is a matter of\nwhat issues are being explored and whether such an expansion makes\nthings clearer or more confused.\n\nThere are nudges which are not paternalistic ( on their definition)\nbecause the aim is to promote the general good\u2014even if the\nchooser is not benefitted. Nudging building managers to put in\nelevators with braille buttons, influencing people to contribute to\nOxfam by putting up pictures of starving infants, are examples where\nthe good to be promoted is the welfare of people other than those\nbeing influenced.\n\nHowever one comes out on the issue of whether the definition of\npaternalism is useful or not we turn to the more important issues\nabout whether, and in what circumstances, nudges are justifiable ways\nof influencing persons to make certain choices.\n",
