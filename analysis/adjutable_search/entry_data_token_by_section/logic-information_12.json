Connections Between the Approaches\n\nWhile the three approaches discussed above (range, correlations, code)\ndiffer in that they emphasise different informational themes, the\nunderlying notion they aim to clarify is the same (information). It is\nthen natural to find that the similarities and synergies between the\napproaches invite the exploration of ways to combine them. Each one of\nthe next subsections illustrates how one could bring together two out\nof the three approaches.\n Section 4.1\n exemplifies the interface between the info-as-range and\ninfo-as-correlation views. Sections\n 4.2\n and\n 4.3\n do the same with the other two pairs of combinations, namely code and\ncorrelations, and code and ranges.\n",
