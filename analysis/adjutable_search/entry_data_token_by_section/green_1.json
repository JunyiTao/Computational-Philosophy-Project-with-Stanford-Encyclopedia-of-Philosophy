    "main_text": "Idealist Metaphysics and Epistemology\n2. Idealist Metaphysics and Epistemology\n\nThe most systematic presentation of Green\u2019s idealist metaphysics\nand epistemology occurs in the first book of the Prolegomena.\nGreen introduces his metaphysical and epistemological inquiries in\nresponse to a naturalistic approach to ethical theory that he thinks\nis prominent in British moral philosophy. He associates ethical\nnaturalism with hedonism and focuses on the utilitarian tradition,\nespecially John Stuart Mill and Henry Sidgwick (PE \u00a72).\nGreen associates naturalism with a kind of empiricism that attempts to\nconstruct knowledge on the basis of the senses, uncorrupted by the\nunderstanding. But Green thinks that there can be no empirical\nknowledge without operations of the understanding and concludes that a\npurely naturalistic or empirical science of morals is impossible\n(PE \u00a78; cf. Works II 83\u201385).\n\nGreen has four main aims in the first book of the\nProlegomena. (1) He wants to reject the empiricist view that\nknowledge can be analyzed into two separable components\u2014the\ndeliverances of the senses and the operations of the\nunderstanding\u2014in which what is given by nature is real and the\ncontributions of the understanding are not (PE\n\u00a7\u00a79\u201310, 20, 70). By contrast, Green argues, even the\nsimplest experience involves operations of the understanding and\nrelations to other elements of a self-conscious mind. (2) The attack\non empiricism is supposed to support the idealist claim that nature is\nthe product of the understanding (PE \u00a720). Green\u2019s\nattack on empiricism is clearly indebted to Kant\u2019s claims in the\nCritique of Pure Reason, especially Kant\u2019s account of\nthe synthetic unity of apperception in the Transcendental Analytic.\nBut, in defending idealism, Green argues that Kant did not carry his\nidealist principles to their logical conclusion (PE\n\u00a741); he rejects the Kantian dualism of appearances and\nthings-in-themselves (PE \u00a7\u00a711, 30\u201341). (3) In\norder for the idealist to distinguish between appearance and reality,\nit is necessary to posit an \u201ceternal\u201d and\n\u201cunalterable\u201d system of relations in a self-conscious\ncorporate agent that includes the finite systems of relations\ncontained in the self-conscious minds of individual persons\n(PE \u00a7\u00a713, 26, 69). (4) Though much of the first\nbook of the Prolegomena is concerned with the role of\nself-consciousness in apparently discrete episodes of experience,\nGreen is also concerned with the role of self-consciousness in\nknowledge. Knowledge requires more than acting on appearances; it\ninvolves assenting to true appearances for good reasons. This requires\nthe ability to distance oneself from appearances and to assess the\nevidence for appearances, especially their congruence with other\nelements of consciousness. This sort of epistemic responsibility\nrequires self-consciousness.\n",
