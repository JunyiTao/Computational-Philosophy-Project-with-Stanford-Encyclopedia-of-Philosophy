    "main_text": "\n\nAmong the things commonly described as reconciled are ideas,\nnarratives, persons, groups, and God. To reconcile theories with one\nanother is to render them mutually consistent. To reconcile yourself\nto the fact that you have cancer is to live better with the belief\nthat you do. Reconciliation of the divine-human relationship is linked\nin the Christian tradition to the notion of salvation. This essay\nconcentrates on the uses to which the concept of reconciliation has\nbeen put in the treatment of moral and political issues that arise in\nthe aftermath of wrongdoing and conflict between persons and\ngroups.\n\nThe term \u2018reconciliation\u2019 is used to refer either to a\nprocess or to an outcome or goal. Reconciliation, as an outcome, is an\nimprovement in the relations among parties formerly at odds with one\nanother. The nature and degree of improvement required to qualify as\nreconciliation for any particular context is a matter of disagreement\namong theorists. So too, the reasons why relations have improved may\nplay a role in determining whether reconciliation has genuinely taken\nplace. That is, on some accounts, two parties will count as reconciled\nonly if their better future relations result from their having\nsatisfactorily dealt with the emotional, epistemic, and/or material\nlegacy of the past. While the outcome of reconciliation is oriented\ntoward a future marked by peaceful and just relations, the processes\nof reconciliation are typically oriented towards the continuing bad\nfeelings, suspicions, or harms that were created by the conflicts and\ninjustices of the past.\n\nPhilosophical interest in reconciliation as a moral and political\nvalue grew in the 1990s in response to its invocation during South\nAfrica\u2019s dramatic transition from apartheid to democracy\n(National Unity and Reconciliation Act, No. 34 of 1995; South\nAfrican Truth and Reconciliation Commission Final Report 1998).\nThe South African case, as well as the difficult issues left in the\nwake of other civil conflicts and periods of repression of the era,\nincluding the transitions from military juntas in South America and\nthe wars in the former Yugoslavia, led political and legal thinkers to\ndefine the topic of transitional justice (see the entry on\n transitional justice).\n The question of transitional justice is: how can post-conflict and/or\npost-repression societies justly make the transition to stable and (it\nis usually stipulated) democratic government given the reality of past\nwrongs and harms (Minow 1998, Teitel 2002, C. Murphy 2017)? Of\noverriding importance is establishing the conditions that will ensure\nthat such abuses happen \u201cNever Again.\u201d In South Africa in\nthe 1990s, \u2018reconciliation\u2019 seemed to be of crucial\nimportance to a just transition. It was in the name of this value that\nthe Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) offered amnesty from\nprosecution to those guilty of politically motivated human rights\nabuses in return for their full and truthful testimony. Theorists and\npolitical analysts debate the extent to which the TRC contributed to\nreconciliation in South Africa, as well as whether its Commissioners\nproperly conceived of reconciliation (Tutu 1999, Rotberg and Thompson\n2000, Gibson 2004, Hamber 2009, Allais 2012, Bates et al. 2020).\n\nIncreasingly, theorists and philosophers apply the language and\ntheories of reconciliation, which were originally developed to deal\nwith transitional contexts, to stable, non-transitional democracies.\nDiscussions of how white settler states such as the United States,\nCanada, and Australia deal with their own historical legacies of\ninjustice are now often posed as debates about reconciliation\n(Thompson 2002, Brooks 2004, Barkan and Karn 2006, Kymlicka and Bashir\n2010, Coulthard 2014, Jung 2018). The value of reconciliation is also\nsometimes appealed to within discussions of criminal law, especially\namong those who are interested in investigating alternative sentencing\nprocedures and sanctions. \u201cRestorative justice\u201d advocates\nconceptualize crime as a problem in the relationship among the\noffender, the victim, and the local community, and look to measures\nsuch as restitution payments and face-to-face dialogue in order to\nrestore that relationship (Braithwaite 2000, van Ness and Strong\n2002). Whether civil law, too, is amenable to interpretations that\nemphasize broken and repaired relationships is an open question\n(Radzik 2014). Meierhenrich (2008) notes connections between the value\nof reconciliation and practices in civil law traditions of\n\u201cconciliation,\u201d where the emphasis is on the accommodation\nof competing claims\n\nFinally, reconciliation has emerged as a topic among moral theorists\nwho discuss the ethical issues that arise in the aftermath of everyday\nforms of wrongdoing, such as transgressions within friendships or\nfamily relationships (Walker 2006, Griswold 2007, Radzik 2009). Much\nof this discussion takes place in the literature on forgiveness (see\nthe entry on\n forgiveness).\n Here, theorists ask whether one may reconcile with a wrongdoer\nwithout also forgiving him, or forgive a person without reconciling.\nSuch questions arise as well in the literature on reconciliation in\npolitical and legal contexts, where there are often strong objections\nto forgiving the wrongdoers (who may, after all, remain unrepentant\nfor committing atrocities) or to placing other people under pressure\nto forgive them. For some, a conception of reconciliation that does\nnot require forgiveness offers a positive way forward in these\ndifficult cases (e.g., Eisikovits 2009, Verdeja 2009, C. Murphy\n2010).\n\nDiscussion of the value of reconciliation, especially in political\ncontexts, often has a skeptical orientation. Dictators and war-makers\npay lip-service to the value of reconciliation while aggression\ncontinues. Such appeals reinforce skepticism about the value of\nreconciliation. In transitional contexts, reconciliation is claimed to\nput unjustifiable demands on victims of wrongdoing and to sacrifice\njustice for peace (Rotberg and Thompson 2000). In non-transitional\ncontexts, fundamental political change is rarely on the table. So, for\nexample, when the governments of white settler states call on\nindigenous peoples to reconcile, the politics of reconciliation may\nsimply look like a demand that indigenous peoples \u2018reconcile\nthemselves to\u2019 the status quo (Coulthard 2014).\n\nOther critics charge that the language of reconciliation lends itself\nto misuse because it is essentially empty. Given that the concept has\nno widely recognized, determinate content or clear normative\nstandards, almost anyone can claim to be pursuing reconciliation\n(Schaap 2008). As this essay will indicate, defenders of the concept\nof reconciliation do believe that it is amenable to further\narticulation. However, while the concept of reconciliation is not\nempty, it defies easy or definitive analysis.\n\nThis entry treats the topic of reconciliation in a manner that\nrespects its significance across moral (viz. interpersonal and\nprivate), legal and political contexts. Many of the issues and debates\nthat arise in the literature on reconciliation are relevant to each of\nthese contexts. However, issues that are specific to political\ncontexts, where the philosophical literature on reconciliation is most\nextensive, will receive special attention.\n\nParticular conceptions of reconciliation vary across a number of\ndimensions. As section 1 explains, the kind of relationship at issue\nin a specific context affects the type of improvement in relations\nthat might be necessary in order to qualify as reconciliation.\nReconciliation is widely taken to be a scalar concept. Section 2\ndiscusses the spectrum of intensity along which kinds of improvement\nin relationships fall, and indicates why, in particular contexts,\ntheorists often disagree about the point along this spectrum that is\nmorally or politically most significant. Section 3 provides an\noverview of the processes commonly cited as contributing to\nreconciliation. These processes are often controversial; those praised\nby some commentators as appropriate and constructive responses to past\nconflict are dismissed by others as undermining the moral or political\nconditions for just and peaceful relations. Section 4 concentrates on\nthe relationship between reconciliation and justice. While some see\nthese values as compatible and mutually supporting, others argue that,\nespecially in the immediate wake of conflict, parties must often\nchoose between reconciliation and justice.\n",
