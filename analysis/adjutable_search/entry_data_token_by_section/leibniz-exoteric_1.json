    "main_text": "Esoteric Form and Esoteric Content\n2. Esoteric Form and Esoteric Content\n\nLeibniz advocated the geometrical model of demonstration as the ideal\nform for metaphysics throughout his career. He claimed later in his\ncareer that he had all the materials at hand to compose a work that\nwas a close approximation of the ideal. Yet such a work he did not\ncompose. Why did Leibniz not make more progress on this task, which\nwould seem to be of such great importance? Leibniz often mentioned his\nlack of free time as the reason for not completing an esoteric\ntreatise. But this seems to provide an incomplete explanation of the\nsituation. Though his extra-philosophical duties were numerous and\nburdensome, he made the time to write quite a lot on metaphysical\nsubjects. If he thought that the geometrical model of demonstration\nwas indeed the ideal form for metaphysics, one cannot help but wonder\nwhy he did not find the time to begin composing such a work.\n\nIt is likely that there were several additional factors that led\nLeibniz to compose exoteric rather than esoteric works. Consider the\nfollowing remarks on the distinction between exoteric and esoteric\nmodes of exposition in his 1704 Nouveaux Essais sur\nl\u2019entendement humain (an unpublished critical examination\nof Locke\u2019s Essay Concerning Human Understanding written\nin dialogue form). The remarks occur in the context of a discussion of\nthe precision (or lack thereof) in natural language:\n\n\nThe ancients distinguished the \u2018exoteric\u2019\n[exoterique] or popular mode of exposition [maniere\nd\u2019ecrire] from the \u2018esoteric\u2019\n[acroamatique] one which is suitable for those who are\nseriously concerned to discover the truth; and that distinction is\nrelevant here. If anyone wants to write like a mathematician in\nmetaphysics or moral philosophy there is nothing to prevent him from\nrigorously doing so; some have announced that they would do this, and\nhave promised us mathematical demonstrations outside mathematics, but\nit is extremely seldom that anyone has succeeded. I believe that\npeople are repelled by the amount of trouble they would have to take\nfor a tiny number of readers: like the question in Persius, \u2018Who\nwill read this?\u2019, with its answer \u2018Maybe a couple of\npeople, maybe no one\u2019. Yet I think that if anyone did go about\nit in the right way, he would have no reason to regret his labour. I\nhave been tempted to try it myself. (NE: 260\u2013261)\n\n\nIn this intriguing text Leibniz (through the voice of Theophilus)\nnotes that few people have tried to write in the esoteric mode, and\neven fewer (if any) have succeeded in the endeavor. He also suggests\nseveral reasons that authors avoid esoteric expositions. Esoteric\ntexts are both difficult to compose and unlikely to attract readers,\npresumably because of their intimidating formal apparatus. And what is\nthe point of writing a text that no one is going to read? This point\nis also emphasized by Leibniz in a 1705 letter to Burnett:\n\n\nI never write anything in philosophy that I do not treat by\ndefinitions and axioms, though I do not always give it that\nmathematical air, which puts people off, for one must speak in a\nfamiliar manner to be read by ordinary people. (G 3:302)\n\n\nDespite these significant drawbacks to writing in the esoteric mode,\nLeibniz insists that if someone pursued this strategy \u201cin the\nright way\u201d it would be a worthwhile project. In the New\nEssays Leibniz does not explain what doing this \u201cin the\nright way\u201d would involve. He does, however, provide some\nimportant additional remarks on esoteric philosophy earlier in the\ntext. In the Preface he points out some key differences between his\nphilosophy and the philosophy of Locke:\n\n\n\u2026although the author of the Essay says hundreds of\nfine things which I applaud, our systems are very different. His is\ncloser to Aristotle and mine to Plato, although each of us parts\ncompany at many points from the teachings of both of these ancient\nwriters. He is more popular [populaire] whereas I am\nsometimes forced to be a little more esoteric [acroamatique]\nand abstract\u2014which is no advantage for me, particularly when\nwriting in a living language. (Preface to the New Essays, NE:\n48)\n\n\nIn these remarks Leibniz is using the term \u201cesoteric\u201d in a\nsubtly different way than he is in the earlier quote from the New\nEssays. Whereas in the first text \u201cesoteric\u201d\ndesignated a mode of presenting one\u2019s philosophy, in\nthis text it concerns the content of one\u2019s philosophy.\nHere he is drawing attention to the fact that his philosophy is less\n\u201cpopular\u201d than Locke\u2019s. Locke\u2019s philosophy is\npopular in the sense that much of his philosophy accords with the\ndeliverances of the senses and so-called \u201ccommon sense\u201d.\nLeibniz\u2019s philosophy, in contrast, is often very abstract and\nfar removed from ordinary opinions. Leibniz elaborates on this point\nin a 1702 letter to Sophie Charlotte where he distinguishes between\nthings that can be known through the senses (the\n\u201csensible\u201d) and things that are the \u201cobject of the\nunderstanding alone\u201d (the \u201cintelligible\u201d). Leibniz\nclaims that the existence of \u201cintelligible things\u201d,\nparticularly the \u201cmind or or soul\u201d, is more certain than\nthe existence of things that can be sensed. However, many people fail\nto recognize this because \u201cthey take sensible things for the\nonly true things\u201d (G 6:502\u20133; AG 188\u20139). This\noverreliance on the senses makes it difficult for people to understand\nLeibniz\u2019s metaphysics, which involves a number of things that\nsimply cannot be known through the senses. This puts Leibniz at a\nsignificant disadvantage when it comes to trying to communicate his\nphilosophy to the general public. Readers are far more likely to find\nfavor with Locke\u2019s philosophy given that it coheres much better\nwith their current beliefs (see Nelson 2005 for more on this general\ntheme).\n\nIn some of his letters Leibniz makes the point about how difficult it\nis for most people to understand his philosophy in even stronger\nterms. Consider, for example, what he writes to Pierre Bayle in\n1702:\n\n\n\u2026I should not be in too much of a hurry to publish what I have\nwritten, the point of which was only to provide some clarification for\nyou, sir, and for some other people, so as to receive the same in\nreturn. For I write not so much to make an impression as to\ninvestigate the truth, which it is often useless, and even harmful, to\npublish\u2014on account of the uninitiated [des profanes],\nwho are incapable of appreciating it, and quite capable of taking it\nthe wrong way. (G 3:66\u20137; WF 127)\n\n\nThese are striking words. Read in isolation from his other remarks on\nthe exoteric/esoteric distinction, one might take this text to suggest\nthat Leibniz had two distinct philosophies\u2014a false philosophy\nsuitable for presentation to the public, and his true philosophy,\nwhich he only revealed to a few trusted correspondents. But\nLeibniz\u2019s claim is not as radical as it might initially seem.\nWhile it is true that the esoteric character of the content of his\nmetaphysics made it susceptible to being seriously misunderstood, his\nsolution was not to permanently hide his views from everyone who was\nlikely to misunderstand them. His point, as additional texts will make\nclear, is that he thinks it is often useless and harmful to\nstraightforwardly present the content of his metaphysics to\nthe public (and even to trusted correspondents). For example, in a\n1710 letter to Charles Hugony, he claims that some of his views\n\n\ncannot be presented in a straightforward manner [ne peut donner\ncruement], since people are likely to misunderstand them \u2026\nin relation to the senses. (G 3:680)\n\n\nThis suggests that although Leibniz thinks it is unwise to present\nsome of his views straightforwardly, there is a way to\npresent them that is not straightforward. We need to now\nconsider what this involves.\n",
