    "main_text": "The Logic of Action in Computer Science\n3. The Logic of Action in Computer Science\n\nThe logic of action plays an important role in computer science. This becomes evident once one realizes that computers perform actions in the form of executing program statements written down in some programming language, changing computer internals and, by interfaces to the outside world, also that outside world. As such a logic of action provides a means to reason about programs, or more precisely, the execution of programs and their effects. This enables one to prove the correctness of programs. In principle, this is something very desirable: if we could prove all our software correct, we would know that they would function exactly the way we designed them. This was already realized by pioneers of computer programming such as Turing (1949) and Von Neumann (Goldstein and Von Neumann 1963). Of course, this ideal is too hard to establish in daily practice for all software. Verification is a nontrivial and time-consuming occupation, and there are also theoretical limitations to it. However, as the alternative is \u201cjust\u201d massive testing of programs experimentally, with no 100% guarantee of correctness, it has remained an active area of research to this day.\n",
