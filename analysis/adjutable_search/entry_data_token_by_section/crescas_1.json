According to Harvey 2010 and Ofir 2001\nCrescas wrote it when he was a young student in Rabbi Nissim of\nGerondi\u2019s yeshiva. In this first work we can see the influence of the\nKabbalistic school of Gerona. According to Ackerman 2013b, this text\nis not from Crescas and so there is no indication that the Kabbalah\nhad any influence on Crescas.\n",
