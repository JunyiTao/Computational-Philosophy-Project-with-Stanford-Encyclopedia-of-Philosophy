    "main_text": "Ethics\n3. Ethics \n\nThe ethical theory of the Dialectics is probably a form of\nindirect consequentialism. Such a theory would be a natural\ncontinuation of earlier Mohist ethics, and it would explain why the\ntexts link morality (y\u00ec \u7fa9) to benefit\n(l\u00ec \u5229) while also specifying norms of conduct\nthat do not directly aim at benefit. This interpretation is\nnecessarily partly conjectural, however. The Dialectics\nsketch a normative theory without presenting a fundamental\njustification for it, thus leaving some uncertainty as to the nature\nof the theory\u2019s\n foundation.[5]\n The fragmentary, unsystematic nature of the texts does not allow us\nto rule out the possibility that the later Mohists held a mixed\ntheory, incorporating both consequentialist and deontological\nelements. Moreover, we should emphasize that the \u201cGreater\nSelection,\u201d in which much of the material on ethics is\ncollected, has suffered severe textual damage, hindering our efforts\nto understand details of the theory and rendering much of the\nfollowing summary tentative. \n\nAs in early\n Mohist thought,\n the core of the later Mohist ethical theory is a cluster of four\ninterrelated concepts: \u201cMorality\u201d (y\u00ec\n\u7fa9, also \u201cduty\u201d or \u201cright\u201d),\n\u201cbenefit\u201d (l\u00ec \u5229, perhaps also\n\u201cwelfare\u201d), \u201cbenevolence\u201d (r\u00e9n\n\u4ec1, also \u201ckindness\u201d or \u201chumaneness\u201d),\nand \u201ccare\u201d (\u00e0i \u611b). These notions\nare explicated more precisely than in the earlier texts, and they are\nfleshed out in ways that seem intended to rectify weaknesses in\nearlier Mohist ethics. \n\nThe texts remain committed to the Mohist doctrine of\n \u201cinclusive care\u201d\n (ji\u0101n \u00e0i \u517c\u611b), or impartial moral\nconcern for everyone, though they give no arguments to justify either\nit or the underlying consequentialist theory. Instead, they treat\ninclusive care as justified and address technical objections, such as\nwhether the notion of all-inclusive caring is logically problematic.\nFor an example of such a technical objection and the Mohists\u2019\nreply, see this supplement: \n\nCanon B73.\n \n\nCompared with early Mohist ethics, the Dialectics specify\nmore precisely what is meant by \u201cinclusive\u201d care,\nindicating that we are to have an equal degree of care for all, using\nthe same phrase that in Mohist geometry refers to two equal lengths:\n\u201cInclusive care is equal; care for each one is equal\u201d\n(EC13). At the same time, the texts clarify that the practice of\ninclusive care does not entail having equal obligations toward all or\ntreating everyone alike. The degree to which we are to seek to promote\nothers\u2019 welfare depends on our relationship to them. \n\nBesides these clarifications, later Mohist ethics introduces four\nmajor innovations. First, the texts no longer appeal to\nti\u0101n \u5929 (Heaven) as a criterion and justification\nof ethical norms. Second, they explicate benefit (l\u00ec\n\u5229) and harm (h\u00e0i \u5bb3) in terms of the\nhappiness or dislike that results from obtaining something, instead of\nthe goods of wealth, population, and order. Third, they introduce an\nexplicit code under which individuals\u2019 obligations to each other\nvary with their relationship. Fourth, they consider how benefit and\nharm are to be weighed in order to guide action in particular\ncontexts. The following subsections will discuss these four points.\n\n",
