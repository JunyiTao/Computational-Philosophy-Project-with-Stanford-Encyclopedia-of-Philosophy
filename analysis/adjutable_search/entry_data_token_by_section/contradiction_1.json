    "main_text": "LEM and LNC\n2. LEM and LNC\n\n\nThe law of excluded middle, LEM, is another of Aristotle's first\nprinciples, if perhaps not as first a principle as LNC. Just\nas Heraclitus's anti-LNC position, \u201cthat everything is and is\nnot, seems to make everything true\u201d, so too Anaxagoras's\nanti-LEM stance, \u201cthat an intermediate exists between two\ncontradictories, makes everything false\u201d (Metaphysics\n1012a25\u201329). Of any two contradictories p and \u00acp, LNC entails\nthat at most one be true while LEM entails that at least one be\ntrue. A logic validates LEM if p v \u00acp is a theorem in that\nlogic. LEM thus imposes a constraint on logical syntax and is distinct\nfrom the Principle of Bivalence, the purely semantic property\ndictating that any given proposition is either true or false. The\nlatter principle is rejected in some multivalued and supervaluationist\nlogics that validate LEM,\na point to which we return in \u00a76 (see also \n many-valued logics,\n Sorites Paradox,\n truth values). Despite the logical\ndistinction between these two principles, in practice they are often conflated.\n\n\nFor Aristotle, the status of LEM and bivalence comes down to the problem of future contingents. In a passage that has launched a thousand treatises,\nAristotle (De Interpretatione, Chapter 9) addresses the\ndifficulties posed by apparently contradictory contingent statements\nabout future events, e.g. (2a,b).\n\n(2a) There will be a sea-battle tomorrow.\n(2b) There will not be a sea-battle tomorrow.\n\n\nClearly, (2a) and (2b) cannot both be true; LNC applies to future\ncontingents as straightforwardly as to any other pair of\ncontradictories. But what of LEM? Here is where the difficulties\nbegin, culminating in the passage with which Aristotle concludes and\n(apparently) summarizes his account:\n It is necessary for there to be or not to be a sea-battle\ntomorrow; but it not necessary for a sea-battle to take place\ntomorrow, nor for one not to take place\u2014though it is necessary\nfor one to take place or not to take place. So, since statements are\ntrue according to how the actual things are, it is clear that wherever\nthese are such as to allow of contraries as chance has it, the same\nnecessarily holds for the contradictories also. This happens with\nthings that are not always so or are not always not so. With these it\nis necessary for one or the other of the contradictories to be true or\nfalse\u2014not, however, this one or that one, but as chance has it;\nor for one to be true rather than the other, yet not\nalready true or false.  Clearly, then it is not necessary\nthat of every affirmation and opposite negation one should be true and\nthe other false. For what holds for things that are does not hold for\nthings that are not but may possibly be or not be; with these it is as\nwe have said. (De Interpretatione 19a30-b4)\n\n\nUnfortunately, given the systematic ambiguity and textual variations\nin the Greek text, the difficulty of telling when Aristotle is\nspeaking with his own voice or characterizing an opponent's argument,\nand the lack of formal devices for the essential scopal distinctions\nat issue, it has never been clear exactly just what has been said here\nand in the chapter more generally. Some, including Boethius and\nLukasiewicz, have seen in this text an argument for rejecting LEM for\nfuture contingent statements, which are therefore to be assigned a\nnon-classical value (e.g. \u201cIndeterminate\u201d) or no\ntruth-value at\n all.[4]\n Their reasoning is based in part on the premise that the alternative\nposition seems to require the acceptance of determinism. Others,\nhowever, read Aristotle as rejecting not simple bivalence for future\ncontingents but rather determinacy itself.  This interpretive\ntradition, endorsed by al-F\u0101r\u0101bi, Saint Thomas, and\nOckham, is crystallized in this passage from Abelard's\nDialectica (210\u201322) cited by Kneale and Kneale (1962:\n214):\n\nNo proposition de contingenti futuro can be determinately\ntrue or determinately false\u2026, but this is not to say that\nno such proposition can be true or false. On the contrary, any such\nproposition is true if the outcome is to be true as it states, even\nthough this is unknown to us.\n\n\nEven if we accept the view that Aristotle is uncomfortable with\nassigning truth (or falsity) to (2a) and (2b), their disjunction\nin (3a) is clearly seen as true, and indeed as necessarily true.\nBut the modal operator must be taken to apply to the disjunction as a\nwhole as in (3b) and not to each disjunct as in (3c).\n\n(3a) Either there will be or there will not be a sea-battle tomorrow.\n\n(3b) \u25a1 (\u03a6\n \u2228\n \u00ac\u03a6)\n\n(3c) \u25a1 \u03a6\n \u2228\n \u25a1 \u00ac\u03a6\n\n\n\nFor Aristotle, LNC is understood primarily not as the principle that\nno proposition can be true simultaneously with its negation, but as a\nprima facie rejection of the possibility that any predicate\nF could both hold and not hold of a given subject (at the\nsame time, and in the same respect). A full rendering of the version\nof LNC appearing at Metaphysics\n1006b33\u201334\u2014\u201cIt is not possible to truly say at the\nsame time of a thing that it is a man and that it is not a\nman\u201d\u2014would require a representation involving operators\nfor modality and truth and allowing quantification over\n times.[5]\n In the same way, LEM is not actually the principle that every\nstatement is either true or has a true negation, but the law that for\nany predicate F and any entity x, x either\nis F or isn't F. \n\n\nBut these conceptualizations of LNC and LEM must be generalized, since\nthe principle that it is impossible for a to be F and not to\nbe F will not apply to statements of arbitrary complexity. We\ncan translate the Aristotelian language, with some loss of\nfaithfulness, into the standard modern propositional versions in (4) and (5) \nrespectively, ignoring the understood modal and temporal\nmodifications:\n\n(4) LNC: \u00ac(\u03a6 \u2227 \u00ac\u03a6) \n(5) LEM: \u03a6\n \u2228\n \u00ac\u03a6\n\n Taking LNC and LEM together, we obtain the result that exactly one\nproposition of the pair {\u03a6, \u00ac\u03a6} holds, where \u00ac\nrepresents contradictory negation. \n",
