    "main_text": "\n\nScience includes many principles at least once thought to be laws of\nnature: Newton\u2019s law of gravitation, his three laws of motion,\nthe ideal gas laws, Mendel\u2019s laws, the laws of supply and\ndemand, and so on. Other regularities important to science were not\nthought to have this status. These include regularities that, unlike\nlaws, were (or still are) thought by scientists to stand in need of\nstronger ground. These include the regularity of the ocean tides, the\nperihelion of Mercury\u2019s orbit, the photoelectric effect, that\nthe universe is expanding, and so on. Scientists also use laws but not\nother regularities to sort out what is possible: It is based on their\nconsistency with Einstein\u2019s laws of gravity that cosmologists\nrecognize the possibility that our universe is closed and the\npossibility that it is open (Maudlin 2007, 7\u20138). In statistical\nmechanics, the laws of an underlying physical theory are used to\ndetermine the dynamically possible trajectories through the state\nspace of the system (Roberts 2008, 12\u201316).\n\nPhilosophers of science and metaphysicians address various issues\nabout laws, but the basic question is: What is it to be a\nlaw? Two influential answers are the systems approach (Lewis, 1973,\n1983, 1986, 1994) and the universals approach (Armstrong, 1978, 1983,\n1991, 1993). Other treatments include antirealist views (van Fraassen\n1989, Giere 1999, Ward 2002, Mumford 2004) and antireductionist views\n(Carroll 1994 and 2008, Lange 2000 and 2009, Maudlin 2007). Beside the\nbasic question, the recent literature has also focused on (i) whether\nlaws are determined by matters of fact, (ii) the role laws play in the\nproblem of induction, (iii) whether laws involve a strong form of\nnecessity, and (iv) the role of laws in physics and how that contrasts\nwith the role of laws in the special sciences.\n",
