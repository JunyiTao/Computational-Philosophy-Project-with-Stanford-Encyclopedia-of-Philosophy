Thus, \\(L\\) is\nthe smallest inner model, while \\(V\\) is the largest. Some large\ncardinals, such as inaccessible, Mahlo, or weakly-compact, may exist\nin \\(L\\). That is, if \\(\\kappa\\) has one of these large cardinal\nproperties, then it also has the property in \\(L\\). But some large\ncardinals cannot exist in \\(L\\). Indeed, Scott (1961) showed that if\nthere exists a measurable cardinal \\(\\kappa\\), then \\(V\\ne L\\). It is\nimportant to notice that \\(\\kappa\\) does belong to \\(L\\), since \\(L\\)\ncontains all ordinals, but it is not measurable in \\(L\\) because a\n\\(\\kappa\\)-complete non-principal measure on \\(\\kappa\\) cannot exist\nthere.\n\nIf \\(\\kappa\\) is a measurable cardinal, then one can construct an\n\\(L\\)-like model in which \\(\\kappa\\) is measurable by taking a\n\\(\\kappa\\)-complete non-principal and normal measure \\(U\\) on\n\\(\\kappa\\), and proceeding as in the definition of \\(L\\), but now\nusing \\(U\\) as an additional predicate. The resulting model, called\n\\(L[U]\\), is an inner model of ZFC in which \\(\\kappa\\) is measurable,\nand in fact \\(\\kappa\\) is the only measurable cardinal. The model is\ncanonical, in the sense that any other normal measure witnessing the\nmeasurability of \\(\\kappa\\) would yield the same model, and has many\nof the properties of \\(L\\). For instance, it has a projective well\nordering of the reals, and it satisfies the GCH.\n\nBuilding similar \\(L\\)-like models for stronger large cardinals, such\nas strong, or Woodin, is much harder. Those models are of the form\n\\(L[E]\\), where \\(E\\) is a sequence of extenders, each\nextender being a coherent system of measures, that encode the relevant\nelementary embeddings.\n\nThe largest \\(L\\)-like inner models for large cardinals that have been\nobtained so far can contain Woodin cardinals that are limits of Woodin\ncardinals (Neeman 2002). However, building an \\(L\\)-like model for a\nsupercompact cardinal is still a challenge. The supercompact barrier\nseems to be the crucial one, for Woodin has shown that for a natural\nkind of inner model for a supercompact cardinal \\(\\kappa\\), which he\ncalls a weak extender model for the supercompactness of \\( \\kappa\n\\), all stronger large cardinals greater than \\(\\kappa\\) that may\nexist in \\(V\\), such as extendible, huge, etc. would also exist in the\nmodel. \n",
