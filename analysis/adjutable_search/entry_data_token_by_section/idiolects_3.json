    "main_text": "The Debate over the Conventionality of Language || Further Important Aspects of the Lewisian account\n2.2 Further Important Aspects of the Lewisian account\n\nSection\n 2.1\n gives the basic vision of natural languages as the embodiment in a\npopulation of a convention defined in terms of a language in the\nabstract sense. There are three further features of Lewis\u2019s view\nthat merit emphasis: his explanation of why natural languages must be\ncompositional, his disclaimer that his account is but an idealization,\nand the fact that his is a theory of expression meaning rather than of\nspeaker meaning.\n\nFor the coordination problem within P to be solved by using\nL, all members of P must be in a position to determine\nthe meaning of all the sentences of L. In other words, it must\nbe that members of P have a way to identify the function that,\nfor any given sentence, will deliver the corresponding meaning. Given\nthe limitations of speakers, both physical and cognitive, there must\nbe a finite and simple way to do this. The compositionality of\nL can help explain how this is possible (see entry on\n compositionality).\nRoughly put, for L to be compositional is for the meaning of\nall complex expressions\ne1\u2026en of L to be\nfully determined by the meaning of their parts and by the way such\nparts are composed. Thus, the functions that map sentences into their\nmeanings will take into account the meaning of their parts and the way\nthey are combined.\n\nBut language use exhibits several problematic features that must be\naccommodated: indexicality, context sensitivity, ambiguity, etc. To\nproperly account for these features, the relevant meaning functions\nmust take several variables as arguments. It will not be a simple\none-to-one mapping from sentence to meaning, but a more complex\nmapping of a sentence together with a speaker, a time, a world, and\nwhat have you, onto a corresponding meaning. Lewis is aware of this,\nand includes it as part of what L should be like if it is to be\nused by P. So long as members of P know this about\nL, and use it while abiding by the conventions of truthfulness\nand trust, there should be no serious trouble. (To say that speakers\nknow this is not to say that they can, upon request, explicitly\ndescribe how it is that L works, but to say that they have\nimplicit knowledge of L, such that they can successfully use\nL to communicate with and understand other members of\nP.) Lewis calls the situation of a language\u2019s being\nrealized in this way a \u201cperfect case of normal language\nuse\u201d. That is, it is at best an idealization in need of\nrefinement. Chomsky and Davidson (below) can be thought of as in\ndifferent ways suggesting that the conceptualization offered here of\nlanguage and its realization is fundamentally mistaken and not merely\na rough draft.\n\nLewis\u2019s is an account of expression meaning and as such\nit is sometimes seen as a useful complement to an intention-based\naccount of speaker\u2019s meaning, such as Paul\nGrice\u2019s. Speaker\u2019s meaning in the Gricean tradition is\nidentified with the effect that, in performing a given utterance, the\nspeaker intends, by means of the audience\u2019s recognition of this\nvery intention, to produce in that audience. The exact form\nmeaning-bestowing intentions take is a matter of debate and not\nespecially relevant here (see entry on\n Paul Grice).\n But a theory of individual speaker\u2019s meaning requires, in\naddition to an accurate statement of the meaning-bestowing intentions,\na complementary theory of expression meaning. Only with the latter can\nwe account, first, for the expectation on the part of the speaker that\nshe or he will be interpreted as intended (and some expectation of\nsuccess is a precondition for the formation of any intention); and\nsecond, for the rate of success in audience uptake. Grice originally\nrelated expression meaning to speaker\u2019s meaning by suggesting\nthat:\n\n\n[expression] x means (timeless[ly]) that\n\u201cso-and-so\u201d might as a first shot be equated with some\nstatement or disjunction of statements about what \u201cpeople\u201d\n(vague) intend\u2026to effect by x. (Grice 1957: 385).\n\n\nLewis\u2019s convention-based account of expression meaning is\ngenerally thought to be a vast improvement on this crude early effort.\nBut equally, Grice\u2019s account of speaker\u2019s meaning gives us\nsomething missing from Lewis\u2019s. For there to be a convention of\nbeing truthful and trusting in L, there has to be something it\nis to speak with a particular meaning on an occasion, and\nGrice\u2019s theory gives us this.\n",
