    "main_text": "\n\n\nOlympiodorus of Alexandria, presumably a late pupil of Ammonius Hermeiou,\nthe commentator on Aristotle and teacher of Simplicius and Philoponus,\nwas one of the last pagans to teach philosophy at the school of\nAlexandria in the 6th century. In his lectures, he\ninterpreted classical philosophical texts, mainly by Plato and\nAristotle; we still possess three of his commentaries on Plato and two\non Aristotle. At times, these seem to be carefully crafted pieces of\npedagogy, but at other times they read more like transcripts drawn up\nby one of the students. Although Olympiodorus comes across as a\nlearned man and guardian of traditional paideia, both\nliterary and philosophical, his \u0153uvre compares unfavorably, from\na philosophical standpoint, with commentaries written by either\nAmmonius or Olympiodorus\u2019 contemporaries such as Simplicius and John\nPhiloponus. Still, his work is valuable in that it affords us vivid\ninsights into the way in which pagan philosophy was taught to young\nmembers of the Christian elite who, for the most part, would move into\ncareers in the clergy or at the Byzantine court. The 6th\ncentury Alexandrian Olympiodorus must be distinguished from another\nOlympiodorus who supposedly lived in the first half of the\n5th century C.E. and was said by Marinus in his Life of\nProclus to have been a teacher of the latter at Athens. No better\nevidence of this earlier figure survives. The relationship of the\nyounger philosopher Olympiodorus to an alchemist, supposedly of the\nsame name and provenance, remains a matter of dispute.\n",
