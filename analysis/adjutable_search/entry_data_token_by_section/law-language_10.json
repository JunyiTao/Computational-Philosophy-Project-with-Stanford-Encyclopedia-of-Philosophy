One easy\nway to express this abstract feature of law is by pointing out that\nthe law can be stated by making normative statements (i.e. statements\nthat use expressions like \u2018obligation\u2019,\n\u2018right\u2019, \u2018must\u2019, \u2018may\u2019). And one\nattractive way of trying to explain the normativity of law is by\nexplaining the meaning and use of the normative language that is often\nused in stating the law. That is, the problem of explaining the nature\nof legal norms (obligations, rights, etc.) can be addressed by\nexplaining the meaning or the use of the normative words that are used\nin law (\u2018obligation\u2019, \u2018right\u2019,\u2026).\nJoseph Raz has put it that \u2018The problem of the normativity of\nlaw is the problem of explaining the use of normative language in\ndescribing the law or legal situations.\u2019 (1990, 170)\n\nWe saw that Bentham\u2019s theory of normative language in general\nwas that, because there is no object, substance or perceptible human\naffection for which they stand as a name, words such as\n\u2018right\u2019 must be \u2018expounded\u2019 by paraphrasing\nsentences containing them. The paraphrase would use sentences that\ncontain only words that can be defined as referring to objects,\nsubstances, and affections. When no such paraphrase is available, he\nconsidered that normative language is meaningless. So he held that the\nphrase \u2018natural rights\u2019 is \u201csimple nonsense: natural\nand imprescriptible rights, rhetorical nonsense; nonsense upon\nstilts\u201d (Bentham 1843, Art.II). While the language is\nmeaningless, he thought, we can explain its use\u2014as a way of\ndoing something. Using such nonsensical expressions is a way in which\nthe speaker expresses his preferences.\n\nAlthough Bentham and John Austin thought that the notion of a\nnatural right was nonsense, they did not at all think the\nsame about the notion of legal rights. In their command\ntheory they found a way of paraphrasing normative expressions in their\nlegal use. They explained the meaning of the word\n\u2018duty\u2019\u2014and thereby the normativity of law\u2014by\nreference to the pain and pleasure that a superior offered as\nmotivation for compliance with the superior\u2019s will:\n\nThat is my duty to do, which I am liable to be\npunished, according to law, if I do not do: this is the\noriginal, ordinary, and proper sense of the word duty.\n(Bentham 1776, 109; cf. John Austin 1832, 14).\n\n\nHart used the resources of twentieth-century philosophy to challenge\nthat approach to normative language. He drew on the work of J.L.\nAustin, a philosopher of language who thought that problems in many\nareas of philosophy could be dissolved by pointing out the things that\npeople do with words. J.L. Austin once suggested that \u201ca\nstatement of \u2018the law\u2019\u201d is a performative statement,\nrather than \u201ca statement of fact\u201d (Austin 1962, 4 n.2).\nThe suggestion is that to state the law is to perform an act (an act\nother than the making of an assertion that could be true or false).\nJ.L. Austin\u2019s claim offered to account for the normativity of\nlaw by reference to the things that people do with words. That hint\nattracted Hart (Hart, 1954), whose theory of law is based on a\n\u2018practice theory of rules\u2019. He articulated the theory by\npointing out what people do with the normative language they use in\nstating rules.\n\nHart started by arguing that Bentham and Austin had explained the\nmeaning and use of normative language in a way that failed to account\nfor its role in ordinary discourse. He pointed out that their account\nof the meaning of the word \u2018duty\u2019 left them unable to draw\na distinction that people ordinarily draw in their use of language,\nbetween the command of a gunman (which no one would say imposes a\n\u2018duty\u2019 or an \u2018obligation\u2019), and a legal\nprescription:\n\nThe plausibility of the claim that the gunman situation displays the\nmeaning of obligation lies in the fact that it is certainly one in\nwhich we would say that B, if he obeyed, was\n\u2018obliged\u2019 to hand over his money. It is, however, equally\ncertain that we should misdescribe the situation if we said, on these\nfacts, that B \u2018had an obligation\u2019 or a\n\u2018duty\u2019 to hand over the money. So from the start it is\nevident that we need something else for an understanding of the idea\nof obligation. There is a difference, yet to be explained, between the\nassertion that someone was obliged to do something and the\nassertion that he had an obligation to do it. (Hart 2012, 82)\n\n\nBentham and Austin would have had a ready response: that people\nordinarily misuse the word \u2018obligation\u2019. They fail to give\nit a meaning that can be expounded by reference to sensible objects.\nBentham and Austin were linguistic philosophers, but (unlike J.L.\nAustin) not ordinary language philosophers. They sought a way of using\nlanguage that would back up their empiricism and utilitarianism, and\nthey were actually pleased if that technique called for a\nreorganisation of ordinary language: it showed that they were\ndisclosing what had been obscured by mere cant.\n\nHart\u2019s approach to language was different. It may seem that he\ndid not need to talk about language, and that his point could have\nbeen made without mentioning types of assertions, or what \u2018we\nwould say\u2019. His argument, you might think, simply puts into the\nlinguistic mode an argument that could be made with no mention of\nlanguage: an argument that you can have an obligation without being\nliable to sanction. And yet, the linguistic form of the argument was\nimportant to Hart. He wanted to avoid explaining the difference\nbetween obligation and coercion in the way a\n natural law\n theorist might (by saying that an obligation is a kind of reason). So\nhis focus on the use of the word \u2018obligation\u2019 is\nno accident. He did not point out the way we use that word as an\noblique way of appealing to our shared wisdom as to what obligation\nis. It was actually important to him to point out how we\nuse the word. His explanation of the normativity of law\nrelies on the use of such words to display an attitude.\n\nHart claimed that a legal system is a system of power-conferring and\nduty-imposing rules, which are validated by a \u2018rule of\nrecognition\u2019. That rule is not made valid by another rule; it is\na \u2018social rule\u2019. In explaining that crucial notion of a\nsocial rule, Hart turned to the use of words to explain the\nnormativity of law. He claimed that a social rule is a regular pattern\nof conduct accompanied by a \u2018distinctive normative\nattitude\u2019, which \u2018consists in the standing disposition of\nindividuals to take such patterns of conduct both as guides to their\nown future conduct and as standards of criticism\u2019 (Hart, 2012,\n255). In accounting for that disposition, or \u2018internal\nattitude\u2019, Hart\u2019s emphasis was on speech acts\u2014on the\nuse that participants in the practice make of normative language.\n\nWhat is necessary [for a social rule to exist] is that there should be\na critical reflective attitude to certain patterns of behaviour as a\ncommon standard, and that this should display itself in criticism\n(including self-criticism), demands for conformity, and in\nacknowledgments that such criticism and demands are justified, all of\nwhich find their characteristic expression in the normative\nterminology of \u2018ought\u2019, \u2018must\u2019, and\n\u2018should\u2019, \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018wrong\u2019\n(Hart, 2012, 57).\n\n\nHart\u2019s interest in normative language was focused not on its\nmeaning, but on the attitude that people display when they use it. His\nexplanation of the difference between non-normative and normative\nassertions (between, as he put it, \u2018the assertion that someone\nwas obliged to do something and the assertion that he had\nan obligation to do it\u2019) was merely that the latter sort of\nassertion is used to display a distinctive sort of attitude.\n\nJust as Bentham\u2019s approach to normative language was allied to\nhis empiricism and his utilitarianism, Hart\u2019s approach to\nnormative language was allied to his philosophical methodology, and to\nhis views on the relation between law and morality. His methodological\npurpose was to elucidate human practices, and he wanted to defend a\nconceptual separation between law and morality\u2014a distinction in\nkind between legal obligation and moral obligation (see Hart 2012,\n239\u2013240). The practice theory of rules attracted him as a tool\nfor those purposes, because it offered a way of accounting for the\nnormativity of law by pointing to forms of behaviour which could be\ndescribed, and which did not (in his view) carry any moral baggage. In\nsaying that people use normative language to display an attitude to\nregularities of behaviour, the theorist did not need to do moral\nphilosophy, and did not need to make any moral evaluations of the\npractice being described. The theorist did not even need to ascribe\nany moral evaluations to the participants in the practice, since the\nfact that people use normative language to display an attitude is,\nHart considered, consistent with their having various moral views or\nnone at all.\n\nHow much simpler it would be to say that normative language means the\nsame in its moral uses and in its legal uses. While a person who says\nthat you must stop at a red light may display various\nattitudes, what he or she asserts is a necessity that implies\na (presumptively) conclusive reason to stop. If the statement is a\nstatement of law, the necessity is a legal necessity; if the statement\nis a moral statement, the necessity is a moral necessity.\n\nThat approach is not only simpler; it closes the gap that Hart left in\nhis theory. According to Hart, the meaning of normative language\ndiffers in morality and in law. But in fact, Hart had nothing to say\nabout the meaning of normative expressions such as\n\u2018ought\u2019 and \u2018must\u2019 or \u2018obligation\u2019\nor \u2018right\u2019 (except that their meaning differs in law and\nin morality). He only pointed out that people display an attitude when\nthey use such language.\n\nJoseph Raz rejected Hart\u2019s claim that normative terms have a\ndistinctive meaning in statements of law. In Raz\u2019s view, to make\na normative statement such as \u2018you must stop at a red\nlight\u2019 is to imply that you have a certain sort of reason for\naction. If it is a statement applying the law, it implies that you\nhave reason to stop from the point of view of the law. Raz\u2019s\ntheory of law, unlike Hart\u2019s, is part of a theory of practical\nreason in general, and his account of normative statements treats them\nas having the same meaning in law and in morality. Hart initially\nthought that that approach would necessarily lead to an extreme sort\nof natural law theory, in which every true statement of law is\nnecessarily a true moral statement, and every valid legal obligation\nis necessarily a moral obligation. But Raz resolved that concern of\nHart\u2019s, by pointing out that normative statements can be made in\na detached way. People can make them without endorsing the point of\nview from which the reasons they are stating are valid (see Raz 1990,\n175\u2013177). Still, Hart did not accept Raz\u2019s approach, which\nhe felt created a certain sort of conceptual connection between law\nand morality. In responding to Raz, he insisted that \u2018statements\nof the subject\u2019s legal duties need have nothing directly to do\nwith the subject\u2019s reasons for action\u2019 (Hart 1982, 267).\nAnd in an interview with the Spanish journal Doxa near the\nend of his career he maintained \u2018that legal and moral obligation\nare conceptually different\u2019, so that a statement of obligation\nhas a different meaning in law and in morality (De Paramo 1988). He\nnever explained the difference in meaning; its necessity only follows\nfrom a methodological preconception.\n",
