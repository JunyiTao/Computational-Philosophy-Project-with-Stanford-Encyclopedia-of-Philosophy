    "main_text": "Philosophy of Religion || Rationality and Belief in God\n8.2 Rationality and Belief in God\n\n\nAbove we explained several features of Reid's epistemology and his\nfoundationalism relevant for understanding his analysis of the\nrationality of belief in God. Reid's case on behalf of the rationality\nof belief in God follows from his critique of Cartesian and Humean\nfoundationalism, which required foundational beliefs to be justified\nby reasoning. According to Reid, foundational beliefs do not require\nproof of their own through argumentation. He writes, \u201cTheir\nevidence is not demonstrative, but intuitive. They require not proof,\nbut to be placed in the proper point of view\u201d (EIP 1.2,\n42). Reason is not the \u201conly judge of truth\u201d (IHM 6.20,\n169). Besides, human reason itself is fallible (EIP 2.22,\n244\u20135). Reason is not necessary for epistemic justification, a fact\nthat situates Reid's theory of empirical knowledge in the externalist\ncamp. \n\n\nWhile this opens the way to a form of non-inferential,\nrational belief in God, no such claim appears among Reid's\nFirst Principles of contingent or necessary truths. Indeed,\nbelief in God possesses few of the features associated with\nReidian First Principles. Denying God's existence is not\nabsurd, belief in God does not have \u201cconsent of ages and\nnations\u201d, and it is not held independently of education\nand acculturation (see EIP 6.4, 463\u2013467). Yet clearly Reid\nholds that belief in God appears to be rational (not a word\nthat Reid deploys as a term of art) without inference. He\nbases his claim that belief in God is rational (again, not a\nterm Reid uses) upon a model familiar from his theory of the\nformation of perceptual beliefs (see Nichols &\nCallerg\u00e5rd 2011).\n",
