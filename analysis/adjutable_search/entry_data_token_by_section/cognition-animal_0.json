    "main_text": "What is Animal Cognition?\n1. What is Animal Cognition?\n\nCognition is often understood to be what permits flexible\ngoal-oriented behavior through information processing. Comparative\ncognition research examines which animal behaviors are cognitive, and\nwhat sort of cognitive mechanisms or processes permit that behavior.\nQuestions include: What sort of representations do animals need to\nsolve particular tasks; do they have mental maps, metacognition, or\nnumber concepts? How do animals learn; do they only have associative\nlearning processes, or do they also learn through trial-and-error,\nplay, insight, or social imitation? How do animals solve problems; do\nthey engage in logical reasoning, causal reasoning, future planning?\nPhilosophers take up these questions, and complement them with\nquestions of their own, such as: Do animals have beliefs? Which\nanimals are conscious? What is the relationship between language and\nthought? Are animals rational? Answering any of these questions\nrequires both scientific investigation into the phenomenon and\nconceptual analysis of the psychological property at stake. The\nphilosophy of animal minds promises to help us gain a deeper\nunderstanding of familiar concepts by exploring them in a new and\nsometimes foreign context\u2014in the lives and communities of other\nspecies.\n\nVideos of animals engaged in surprising behaviors, such as an\norangutan washing clothes and sawing wood or a dog using buttons to\n\u201cspeak\u201d (see\n Other Internet Resources),\n might suggest that these animals are smart or intelligent. The idea\nthat some animals are smarter than others might also lead you to\nexpect that research in animal cognition focuses on animals such as\nchimpanzees, elephants, dolphins, dogs, or ravens\u2014all species\nthat often make the news with reports of their amazing abilities. But\nanimal cognition research is just as interested in research on worms,\nhoneybees, snakes, stickleback fish, chickadees, and spiders, though\nthere remains quite a bit of cognition research on the behaviorist\nstandbys of pigeons and rats.\n\nFurthermore, animal cognition research tends to eschew questions of\nwhich animals are smarter than others, focusing instead on more\nspecific questions like the ones above. Scientists often say that they\nare more interested in how well an animal evolved to thrive in their\nenvironment, rather than in how smart they are. This way of thinking\nabout intelligence makes comparing intelligence between species moot\n(though it is a topic that is largely unexplored by philosophers of\nanimal minds).\n\nContemporary research in animal cognition has as its roots Charles\nDarwin\u2019s theory of evolution by natural selection, and\nDarwin\u2019s thesis of the continuity of the mental across\nspecies:\n\n\nthe difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it\nis, certainly is one of degree and not of kind. (Darwin 1874: 126,\nwith a minor variation 1871: 105)\n\n\nIn On the Origin of Species (1859), he avoided comparing\nhumans with other animals, as well as foregoing any discussion of the\nevolution of psychological capacities. In his follow up book, The\nDescent of Man (1871 [second edition 1874]), Darwin turned to\ncompare the psychological capacities across species. In introducing\nChapter 3 (chapter 2 in the first edition), he wrote:\n\n\nIf no organic being excepting man had possessed any mental power, or\nif his powers had been of a wholly different nature from those of the\nlower animals, then we should never have been able to convince\nourselves that our high faculties had been gradually developed. But it\ncan be shewn that there is no fundamental difference of this kind. We\nmust also admit that there is a much wider interval in mental power\nbetween one of the lowest fishes, as a lamprey or lancelet, and one of\nthe higher apes, than between an ape and man; yet this interval is\nfilled up by numberless gradations. (Darwin 1874: 65, with a couple of\nminor variations 1871: 34\u201335).\n\n\nDarwin\u2019s talk of higher and lower suggests that some animals are\nless intelligent than others, and that humans, with our advanced\nmental powers, are on top. But that interpretation is in contrast with\nhow comparative psychologists like to think about animals, as\ndifferent rather than as higher or lower. Furthermore, in The\nOrigin Darwin insisted that evolution by natural selection is\nnon-hierarchical\u2014just changes in response to the environment\nrather than a gradual improvement from lower to higher beings.\n\nWhile Darwin is known for his thesis that there is continuity between\nhumans and other animals in their morphological and psychological\nproperties, one might be forgiven for thinking that Darwin was\nsometimes overly hasty in ascribing some human properties to animals.\nIn The Descent, Darwin discusses cases of horses and dogs who\nare ill-tempered and sulky, a baboon and a dog who recognized friendly\npeople after years apart, dreaming canaries, elephants who blow on\nout-of-reach objects to bring them closer, a bear who pawed the water\nto draw in a floating object, a monkey who kept a stone hidden in his\nbedding that he used to crack nuts, and female birds who are attracted\nto male songs and bright colors. Darwin takes these cases to suggest\nanimal emotion, memory, imagination, reason, property, and aesthetic\nsensibility.\n\nThe theory of evolution by natural selection suggests that there will\nbe differences as well as similarities across species. Just as\nDarwin\u2019s finches have different beak shapes depending on the\nfood available on their island, psychological difference should be\nexpected given different environmental pressures. Thus, a Darwinian\napproach to animal cognition will emphasize differences as well as\nsimilarities. Problems arise when the focus is only on questions about\nsimilarities without also attending to questions about differences,\nand vice versa, as we will see in\n section 2.\n\nWhile Darwin may be seen as the progenitor of modern animal cognition\nresearch, many other scientists have played a role, leading to the\nvibrant interdisciplinary research we see today. Learning theorists\nwho look carefully at the mechanisms that lead to acquiring new\nknowledge arose from the behaviorist methods of John Watson and B.F.\nSkinner. Field researchers owe much to the classical ethologists\nNikolaas Tinbergen, Konrad Lorenz, and Karl von Frisch. Considerations\nof animal culture found their own progenitor in the work of ecologist\nand anthropologist Kinji Imanishi, who saw social transmission in\nanimals as the same process that supports human cultural learning. The\nidea of creating puzzles for animals to solve can be traced back to\npsychologist Edward Thorndike\u2019s puzzle boxes for cats. The\nrejuvenation of interest in animal consciousness finds an early\ndefense in psychologist Margaret Floy Washburn, whose textbook The\nAnimal Mind: A Text-book of Comparative Psychology (1908) was\nwidely used in psychology for the first third of the twentieth\ncentury. The interface between psychology, anthropology, and biology\nis where most of the research in animal cognition can be found\ntoday.\n\nComparative cognition is the scientific study of animal cognitive\ncapacities that recognizes humans as animals and acknowledges that all\nanimals are evolved biological organisms. It also recognizes that\nthere are species-specific capacities as well as individual\ndifferences, and that these capacities are a part of the natural world\nthat can be studied using familiar scientific methods. Animal\ncognition focuses on capacities and psychological states that are\ncausally effective in behavior, and thus the study of animal cognition\ncan be understood broadly to include all topics that philosophers\ncover under the notion of mind.\n\nFor some, the current philosophical interest in comparative cognition\nwas inspired by series of books written by zoologist Donald Griffin\narguing for animal thinking and animal consciousness (Griffin 1976\n[1981], 1985, 1992 [2001]), topics that were not at the time taken up\nby scientists. Collaborations between scientists and philosophers\nprovided a rich environment for initial work on these issues. Notably,\nin philosopher Colin Allen and biologist Marc Bekoff\u2019s book\nSpecies of Mind: The Philosophy and Biology of Cognitive\nEthology (1997), the interdisciplinary team introduced many\nissues arising in the science of animal minds to the broader\nphilosophical community.\n\nPhilosophers of animal minds are sometimes interested in epistemic\nvirtues related to how the claims of the science are generated and\njustified, and whether the concepts being used in scientific studies\nare reasonable. Philosophers of animal minds are also sometimes\ninterested in how the findings of scientific studies can serve as\npremises in philosophical arguments. In the remainder of this entry we\nwill explore both of these aspects.\n",
