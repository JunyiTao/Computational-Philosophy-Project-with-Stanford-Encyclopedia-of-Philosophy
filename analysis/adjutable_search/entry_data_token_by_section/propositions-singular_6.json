Conclusion\nThere are compelling reasons to countenance singular propositions\nas the contents of some sentences of natural language and our\nattitudes. But singular propositions give rise to metaphysical\ndifficulties, as propositions have traditionally been taken to be\nnecessary, permanent existents, but ordinary objects are\nnot. Solutions to these difficulties require stances on general issues\nin the metaphysics of modality and time. In this essay we have\nsurveyed some of the reasons for accepting singular propositions,\nexamined the metaphysical difficulties they create, and distinguished\nseveral strategies for solving those difficulties.\n",
