    "main_text": "\n\nA set of properties A supervenes upon another set B\njust in case no two things can differ with respect to\nA-properties without also differing with respect to their\nB-properties. In slogan form, \u201cthere cannot be an\nA-difference without a B-difference\u201d.\n\nAs we shall see, this slogan can be cashed out in many different ways.\nBut to illustrate the basic idea, imagine that there is a perfect\nforger. Her copies of paintings not only fool the art dealers, but are\nin fact exact duplicates of the originals down to the precise\nplacement of every molecule of pigment\u2014indeed, down to every\nmicrophysical detail. Suppose that she produces such a copy of El\nGreco\u2019s A View of Toledo. It is of course different\nfrom the original in various respects\u2014it is a forgery, it was\nnot painted by El Greco, it is worth quite a bit less at\nSotheby\u2019s, and so forth. But the forgery is also exactly\nlike the original in other respects. It is the same shape, size,\nand weight. The surface of the canvas contains the same arrangements\nof colors and shapes\u2014a blue rectangle here, a green swirl there.\nIndeed, it looks just the same, at least to a single viewer\nunder identical lighting conditions and so forth. Perhaps it is even\njust as beautiful as the original, though that is more\ncontroversial.\n\nThe properties that the forgery is guaranteed to share with the\noriginal are those that supervene upon its microphysical properties.\nTwo paintings that are microphysically just alike are guaranteed to be\njust alike in the arrangement of colors and shapes on their canvases.\nThat is, you cannot change the arrangement of colors and shapes on a\npainting\u2019s canvas without changing its microphysical properties.\nThis is just to say that the arrangement of colors and shapes\nsupervenes on its microphysical properties.\n\nSupervenience is a central notion in analytic philosophy. It has been\ninvoked in almost every corner of the field. For example, it has been\nclaimed that aesthetic, moral, and mental properties supervene upon\nphysical properties. It has also been claimed that modal truths\nsupervene on non-modal ones, and that general truths supervene on\nparticular truths. Further, supervenience has been used to distinguish\nvarious kinds of internalism and externalism, and to test claims of\nreducibility and conceptual analysis.\n\nSupervenience is related to but distinct from notions like grounding\nand ontological dependence. We directly address the relation between\nthese notions in \u00a73.5 (much of that section has been part of this\nentry since its initial publication in 2005).\n",
