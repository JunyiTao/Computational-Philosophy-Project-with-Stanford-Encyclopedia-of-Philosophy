    "main_text": "Recent History\n1. Recent History\n\nWith the establishment of environmental aesthetics, efforts to open\nthe field of aesthetics beyond the fine arts started during the latter\nhalf of twentieth century. Almost all writers on everyday aesthetics\nderive inspiration from John Dewey\u2019s Art as Experience,\nfirst published in 1934. In particular, his discussion of\n\u201chaving an experience\u201d demonstrates that\naesthetic experience is possible in every aspect of people\u2019s\ndaily life, ranging from eating a meal or solving a math problem to\nhaving a job interview. By locating \u2018the aesthetic\u2019 in the\ncharacter of an experience rather than in a specific kind of object or\nsituation, Dewey paves the way for everyday aesthetics advocates to\nexplore diverse aspects of people\u2019s aesthetic lives without a\npre-configured boundary.\n\nIf Dewey\u2019s aesthetics can be considered as the classic for\neveryday aesthetics discourse, Arnold Berleant\u2019s early works on\naesthetic field and engagement continue the trajectory. Despite\nfocusing on the experience of art and without specifically referring\nto the term \u2018everyday aesthetics,\u2019 Berleant\u2019s early\nworks provide a phenomenological account of aesthetic experience by\nemphasizing the interactive process between the experiencing agent and\nthe object of experience. This notion of \u2018engagement\u2019 as a\nmodel for aesthetics is applicable to one\u2019s experience beyond\nart. Indeed, his subsequent works on environmental aesthetics, both\nnatural and built, and more recently on social aesthetics and negative\naesthetics, have been consistently opening the scope of aesthetic\ninquiry.\n\nBesides works on environmental aesthetics that addresses built\nenvironments (see the entry on \n environmental aesthetics), \n other notable\nearly works specifically addressing issues of everyday aesthetics\ninclude Melvin Rader and Bertram Jessup\u2019s Art and Human\nValues (1976), Joseph Kupfer\u2019s Experience as Art:\nAesthetics in Everyday Life (1983), David Novitz\u2019s The\nBoundaries of Art: A Philosophical Inquiry into the Place of Art in\nEveryday Life (1992), Thomas Leddy\u2019s \u201cEveryday\nSurface Aesthetic Qualities: \u2018Neat,\u2019 \u2018Messy,\u2019\n\u2018Clean,\u2019 \u2018Dirty\u2019\u201d (1995) and\n\u201cSparkle and Shine\u201d (1997), Wolfgang Welsch\u2019s\nUndoing Aesthetics (1997), Ossi Naukkarinen\u2019s\nAesthetics of the Unavoidable: Aesthetic Variations in Human\nAppearance (1999), and Marcia Eaton\u2019s Aesthetics and\nthe Good Life (1989) and Merit, Aesthetic and Ethical\n(2001).\n\nThe first anthology on this topic, The Aesthetics of Everyday\nLife, edited by Andrew Light and Jonathan M. Smith, published in\n2005, includes many articles that together lay the groundwork for more\nrecent literature on everyday aesthetics. Often cited among them are\nArto Haapala\u2019s \u201cOn the Aesthetics of the Everyday:\nFamiliarity, Strangeness, and the Meaning of Place\u201d and Tom\nLeddy\u2019s \u201cThe Nature of Everyday Aesthetics.\u201d \n\nThe first monograph with the specific title Everyday\nAesthetics, accompanied by the subtitle Prosaics, the Play of\nCulture and Social Identities, was written by Katya Mandoki and\npublished in 2007. She offers an extensive critique of the prevailing\nWestern aesthetics discourse burdened by what she characterizes as\n\u201cfetishes\u201d regarding art and beauty, as well as a detailed\nsemiotic analysis of aesthetics involved in areas ranging from\nreligion and education to family and medicine. Almost immediately\nafter the publication of Mandoki\u2019s book, Yuriko Saito\u2019s\nEveryday Aesthetics was published. These works were followed\nby Thomas Leddy\u2019s The Extraordinary in the Ordinary: The\nAesthetics of Everyday Life (2012). They together secured the\ninitial foothold for the subsequent development of everyday\naesthetics.\n\nParalleling these early works are monographs and anthologies dedicated\nto specific aspects of daily life, such as gustatory aesthetics\n(Korsmeyer 1999, 2005; Perullo 2016; van der Meulen and Wiese 2017),\ndomestic aesthetics (McCracken 2001), body aesthetics (Shusterman\n1999, 2013; Bhatt 2013; Irvin 2016), functional beauty (Parsons and\nCarlson 2008), the aesthetics of design (Forsey 2013), and olfactory\naesthetics (Drobnick 2005; Shiner forthcoming), as well as a\ncollection of essays dealing with the notion of\n\u201cartification\u201d in practices ranging from business and\neducation to science and sports (Naukkarinen and Saito, 2012).\n\nAll of these works together have given rise to an increasingly lively\ndebate on the subject in journals such as Aisthesis, The\nBritish Journal of Aesthetics , Contemporary Aesthetics,\nEspes, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism,\nThe Nordic Journal of Aesthetics, Proceedings of the\nEuropean Society for Aesthetics, and Studi di Estetica\n(Italian Journal of Aethetics), to name only a few that feature\nor include articles in English. In addition, more anthologies on\neveryday aesthetics have been published recently, namely the \nAisthesis volume dedicated to the subject of Everyday Objects\n(2014), Experiencing the Everyday (Friberg and Vasquez 2017),\nand Paths from the Philosophy of Art to Everyday Aesthetics\n(Kuisma, et al. 2019). These anthologies and journals are particularly\nhelpful to those Anglophone readers who lack the language facility to\naccess many European aestheticians\u2019 works, some monographs, that\nare written in their own languages. Among them are Gioia Iannilli,\nGiovanni Matteucci, Dan Eugen Ratiu, and Elisabetta di Stefano. Their\nEnglish language articles included in these anthologies and journals\nare valuable in making their important works available to Anglophone\nreaders.\n\nAs was the case with her Everyday Aesthetics, Saito\u2019s\nrecent monograph, Aesthetics of the Familiar: Everyday Life and\nWorld-Making (2017a) includes extensive discussion of Japanese\naesthetics. However, the first explicitly and specifically\nmulti-cultural exploration of everyday aesthetics appeared in the form\nof an anthology, Aesthetics of Everyday Life: East and West\n(2014), edited by Liu Yuedi and Curtis Carter, with a number of pieces\non Chinese aesthetics. Similar to the case of European languages, most\nAnglophone readers lack the language ability to access many works on\nChinese aesthetics written in Chinese. English language papers\nincluded in this anthology and other journal articles by scholars\nprovide a good entry into a rich legacy of living aesthetics in the\nChinese tradition that is garnering a renewed attention today.\nFinally, although not specifically dedicated to everyday aesthetics,\nmany essays collected in the Special Volume 3 of Contemporary\nAesthetics (2011) on Aesthetics and the Arts of Southeast Asia,\nthe same journal\u2019s Special Volume 6 (2018) on Aesthetic\nConsciousness in East Asia, and Artistic Visions and the Promise\nof Beauty: Cross Cultural Perspectives (Higgins, et al 2017)\nprovide valuable resources for non-Western aesthetics.\n",
