    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Work\n\nAustin was born in Lancaster, England 26 March 1911 to Geoffrey\nLangshaw Austin and his wife Mary Austin (n\u00e9e Bowes-Wilson).\nThe family moved to Scotland in 1922, where Austin\u2019s father\nwas Secretary of St. Leonard\u2019s School, St. Andrews.\n\nAustin took up a scholarship in Classics at Shrewsbury School in 1924,\nand, in 1929, went on to study Classics at Balliol College, Oxford. In\n1933, he received a First in Literae Humaniores (Classics and\nPhilosophy) in 1933 and was elected to a Fellowship at All Souls\nCollege, Oxford. He undertook his first teaching position in 1935, as\nfellow and tutor at Magdalen College, Oxford.\n\nAustin\u2019s early interests included Aristotle, Kant, Leibniz, and\nPlato (especially Theaetetus). His more contemporary\ninfluences included especially G.E. Moore, John Cook Wilson, and H.A.\nPrichard. (Austin attended Prichard\u2019s undergraduate lectures\nwith such vigour that Prichard is reported to have made an\nunsuccessful attempt to exclude him.) It\u2019s plausible that some\naspects of Austin\u2019s distinctive approach to philosophical\nquestions derived from his engagement with the last three. All three\nphilosophers shaped their views about general philosophical questions\non the basis of careful attention to the more specific judgments we\nmake. And they took our specific judgments (for instance, in\nMoore\u2019s case, \u201cI know that I have hands\u201d) to be, in\ngeneral, more secure than more general judgments (for instance, again\nin Moore\u2019s case, \u201cI know things about external\nreality\u201d). Moreover, there are some continuities of doctrine,\nespecially with Cook Wilson and Prichard, which align Austin with an\n\u201cOxford Realist\u201d school of philosophy. The core components\nof the latter view are, first, that perception and knowledge are\nprimitive forms of apprehension and, second, that what we apprehend\nare ordinary elements of our environments that are independent of our\napprehending them. (All three thinkers were at one or another time\ncommitted to versions of both components of the position but for\ncomplex reasons sometimes wavered about the second. See e.g., Travis\nand Kalderon 2013.)\n\nDuring the Second World War, Austin served in the British Intelligence\nCorps. It has been said of him that, \u201che more than anybody was\nresponsible for the life-saving accuracy of the D-Day\nintelligence\u201d (reported in Warnock 1963: 9). Austin left the\narmy in September 1945 with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was\nhonoured for his intelligence work with an Order of the British\nEmpire, the French Croix de Guerre, and the U.S. Officer of the Legion\nof Merit. \n\nAustin married Jean Coutts in 1941. They had four children, two girls\nand two boys.\n\nAfter the War, Austin returned to Oxford. He became White\u2019s\nProfessor of Moral Philosophy in 1952. In the same year, he took on\nthe role of delegate to Oxford University Press, becoming Chairman of\nthe Finance Committee in 1957. His other administrative work for the\nUniversity included the role of Junior Proctor (1949\u201350), and\nChairman of the Sub-Faculty of Philosophy (1953\u201355). He was\npresident of the Aristotelian Society 1956\u201357. He gave the\nWilliam James Lectures in Harvard in 1955 (a version of the lectures\nwas published as How to Do Things With Words \u2013 see\n1962b in the Bibliography). He invented the card game CASE in 1951.\n\nDuring this period, Austin edited H.W.B. Joseph Lectures on the\nPhilosophy of Leibniz (1949) and produced a translation of\nGottlob Frege\u2019s Grundlagen der Arithmetik, so that it\ncould be set as an exam (1950). Austin wrote little and published\nless. Much of his influence was through teaching and other forms of\nsmall-scale engagement with philosophers. He also instituted a series\nof \u201cSaturday Morning\u201d discussion sessions, which involved\ndetailed discussions of a number of philosophical topics and works,\nincluding Aristotle\u2019s Nichomachean Ethics,\nFrege\u2019s Grundlagen, Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s\nPhilosophical Investigations, Merleau-Ponty\u2019s\nPhenomenology of Perception, and Noam Chomsky\u2019s\nSyntactic Structures.\n\nAustin died in Oxford on 8 February 1960.\n\n(For more detail about Austin\u2019s life, work, and influences see\nAyer 1978; Baldwin 2010; Berlin 1973b; Dancy 2010; Garvey 2014;\nGustaffson 2011; Hacker 2004; Hampshire 1960; Travis and Kalderon\n2013; Marion 2000a,b, 2009; Passmore 1957; Pears 1962; Pitcher 1973;\nSearle 2014; Urmson and Warnock 1961; Urmson 1967; Warnock 1963,\n1973a; Warnock 1989: 1\u201310.)\n2. Language and Truth\n2.1 Language and Philosophy\n\nIn this section, we\u2019ll look at Austin\u2019s views about the\nrole of the study of language in philosophy more generally. It is\ncommon to count Austin as an \u201cOrdinary Language\nPhilosopher\u201d, along with, for example, Gilbert Ryle, P.F.\nStrawson, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. However, although each of these\nthinkers was sometimes concerned, in one or another way, with our use\nof ordinary language, it is far from clear what in addition to that\nthe label is supposed to entail. And it is equally unclear that the\nvarious thinkers so-labelled deserve to be grouped together.\n\nAustin cared about language for two main reasons. First, language use\nis a central part of human activity, so it\u2019s an important topic\nin its own right. Second, the study of language is an\naide\u2014indeed, for some topics, an important preliminary\u2014to\nthe pursuit of philosophical topics. Many of Austin\u2019s most\ndistinctive reflections on the use of language arise in the course of\ndiscussion of other topics (see especially his \u201cA Plea for\nExcuses\u201d 1957).\n\nOne route to understanding Austin\u2019s general approach to\nphilosophy is provided by reflection on the following comment by\nStuart Hampshire:\n\n\n[Austin] was constitutionally unable to refrain from applying the same\nstandards of truth and accuracy to a philosophical argument, sentence\nby sentence, as he would have applied to any other serious\nsubject-matter. He could not have adopted a special tone of voice, or\nattitude of mind, for philosophical questions. (Hampshire 1960:\n34)\n\n\nIn short, it mattered to Austin that, in attempting to make out\npositions and arguments, philosophers should meet ordinary standards\nof truth, accuracy, and so forth. On the one hand, this presented a\ngeneral challenge to philosophers, a challenge that they might easily\nfail to meet. The challenge is either to make use of an ordinary\nvocabulary, or ordinary concepts, in order to make claims or judgments\nthat are, according to ordinary standards, at least true (or accurate,\netc.); or to do the serious work required to set up an appropriate\ntechnical vocabulary and then use it to say things that are by\nappropriate standards true (accurate, etc.). On the other hand, it\nprovided Austin with what he took to be a reasonably secure approach\nto general philosophical questions: first, find a connection between\nthose general philosophical questions and the more specific claims or\njudgments that we ordinarily make and take ourselves to be secure in\nmaking; second, make sufficiently many of the relevant claims or\njudgments, in a sufficient variety of circumstances, in order to\naddress the general philosophical questions.\n\nAustin held that, in their hurry to address general philosophical\nquestions, philosophers have a tendency to ignore the nuances involved\nin making and assessing ordinary claims and judgments. Among the risks\nassociated with insensitivity to the nuances, two stand out. First,\nphilosophers are liable to miss distinctions that are made in our\nordinary use of language and that are relevant to our concerns and\nclaims. Second, failure to exploit fully the resources of ordinary\nlanguage can make philosophers susceptible to seemingly forced choices\nbetween unacceptable alternatives. Here Austin warns:\n\n\nIt is worth bearing in mind\u2026the general rule that we must not\nexpect to find simple labels for complicated cases\u2026however\nwell-equipped our language, it can never be forearmed against all\npossible cases that may arise and call for description: fact is richer\nthan diction. (1957: 195)\n\n\nOn Austin\u2019s view, language is likely to be well designed for the\nends to which it is ordinarily put. But special, or especially\ncomplicated, cases may require special treatment. This is apt to be an\nespecial liability when it comes to the question whether a sentence\ncan be used in a particular circumstance to state something true or\nfalse:\n\n\nWe say, for example, that a certain statement is exaggerated or vague\nor bold, a description somewhat rough or misleading or not very good,\nan account rather general or too concise. In cases like these it is\npointless to insist on deciding in simple terms whether the statement\nis \u201ctrue or false\u201d. Is it true or false that Belfast is\nnorth of London? That the galaxy is the shape of a fried egg? That\nBeethoven was a drunkard? That Wellington won the battle of Waterloo?\nThere are various degrees and dimensions of success in making\nstatements: the statements fit the facts always more or less loosely,\nin different ways on different occasions for different intents and\npurposes. (1950a: 129\u2013130)\n\n\nAustin makes two points here. First, when faced with a putative choice\nof this sort, we should not insist on deciding in simple\nterms whether a statement is true or false (or whether an\nexpression applies or fails to apply to something). Some cases are\ncomplicated, and, in some of those cases, we are capable of meeting\nsome of the complications by saying more: \u201cWell, it is true that\nBelfast is north of London if you understand that claim in the\nfollowing way\u2026.\u201d Second, the complications can take\ndifferent forms, and can matter in different ways, on different\noccasions. Given the prior course of our conversation, and our\nspecific intents and purposes in discussing the issue, it might be\nmanifest that, on that particular occasion, we will\nunderstand the complications, without a need for their\narticulation, so that the following is fine as it stands: \u201cYes,\nit is true that Belfast is north of London.\u201d\n\nAustin\u2019s summarised his view of the role of attention to\nordinary language in philosophy thus:\n\n\nFirst, words are our tools, and, as a minimum, we should use clean\ntools: we should know what we mean and what we do not, and we must\nforearm ourselves against the traps that language sets us. Secondly,\nwords are not (except in their own little corner) facts or things: we\nneed therefore to prise them off the world, to hold them apart from\nand against it, so that we can realize their inadequacies and\narbitrariness, and can re-look at the world without blinkers. Thirdly,\nand more hopefully, our common stock of words embodies all the\ndistinctions men have found worth drawing, and the connexions they\nhave found worth making, in the lifetimes of many generations: these\nsurely are likely to be more sound, since they have stood up to the\nlong test of the survival of the fittest, and more subtle, at least in\nall ordinary and reasonably practical matters, than any that you or I\nare likely to think up in our arm-chairs of an afternoon\u2014the\nmost favoured alternative method. (1957:\n 181\u2013182)[1]\n\n\nAustin holds, then, that an important preliminary to philosophising on\nat least some topics\u2014for instance, where the topic is\n\u201cordinary and reasonably practical\u201d\u2014would be the\ndetailed study of the language we use to speak on that topic, and of\nthe way that we use it.\n\nAustin didn\u2019t think that the investigation of language was more\nthan a preliminary to theorising, either in philosophy or science. He\nwasn\u2019t averse to theory construction, even if its outcome were\npotentially revisionary (see e.g., 1957: 189). His concern was only\nthat such theorising should be properly grounded, and that it should\nnot be driven, for example, by an initial failure to keep track of\ndistinctions that we mark in our ordinary use of language. Further,\nAustin draws an important distinction between \u201cwords and facts\nor things,\u201d and he seems to suggest that we have ways of\ninvestigating the world\u2014that is, facts and things\u2014which\ncan bypass the \u201cblinkers\u201d sometimes imposed on us by our\nwords. We\u2019ll return to Austin\u2019s distinction between the world,\nincluding facts\u2014which Austin thinks of as particular or\nconcrete\u2014and words, including the statements we make in using\nwords, in \n section 2.2. \n And we\u2019ll return to Austin\u2019s idea that we can\nhave unblinkered awareness of the world\u2014unblinkered, that is, by\nthe linguistic or judgmental capacities that we bring to bear on what\nwe experience\u2014in \n section 3.1.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that Austin\u2019s work has been caught up in\nthe stampede away from broadly ordinary language-based approaches to\nphilosophical questions. The work of Paul Grice, collected in his\nStudies in the Way of Words (1989), has played an important\nrole in the negative assessment of such approaches, including aspects\nof Austin\u2019s work. One central idea in Grice\u2019s work is that\nthe ways in which we use language\u2014crudely, the pairings of\nsituations and sentences that we find appropriate or inappropriate, or\nwhat we would or wouldn\u2019t say in those situations\u2014is not a\nsimple function of the nature of the respective situations and the\ncorrectness conditions with which the sentences are associated.\nRather, judgments about appropriateness are driven also by, for\nexample, our sensitivities to the demands of rational co-operation\nwith our conversational partners. And it has been thought that, in one\nor another way, ordinary language philosophers, including Austin, have\nbeen insensitive to the additional parameters to which judgments of\nappropriateness are beholden (for early attacks of this sort, see Ayer\n1967 and Searle 1966). It is beyond the scope of this entry to attempt\nto assess either the extent to which Austin should really be seen as a\ntarget of such objections or, if he should, whether they demonstrate\nweaknesses in his work. However, in pursuing any such assessment, it\nis important to note that Austin\u2019s exploitation of ordinary\nlanguage is never driven by simple appeal to whether, in a situation\nconsidered as a whole, we would take it to be simply appropriate or\ninappropriate to use some sentence or other. Rather, Austin\nis\u2014as we are\u2014sensitive to more fine-grained appraisals of\nuses of bits of language and, when he judges that an utterance on an\noccasion would be false or nonsensical, he intends that judgment to\ncontrast with less damaging negative appraisals\u2014for example,\nabout what it would be merely inappropriate or impolite to say.\nMoreover, Austin is sensitive to the specific features of situations\nupon which we base one or another more fine-grained appraisal of uses\nof sentences. As he stresses, \u201cIt takes two to make a\ntruth\u201d (1950a: 124 fn.1). And Austin is sensitive to the details\nof both participants in that and other forms of transaction between\nword and\n world.[2]\n\n(For discussion of Austin\u2019s approach to philosophical questions,\nwith reference to his classification as an ordinary language\nphilosopher, see Berlin 1973b; Cavell 1965; Garvey 2014; Grice 1989:\n3\u201321; Gustafsson 2011; Hampshire 1960, 1965; Kaplan 2018: 1\u201339; Longworth 2018a; Marion 2009; Martin\nms (Other Internet Resources); Pears 1962; Pitcher 1973; Putnam 1994;\nQuine 1965; Reimer 2018; Searle 1966; Soames 2003: 171\u2013219; Travis 1991;\nUrmson 1965, 1967; Urmson and Warnock 1961; Warnock 1973a, 1989:\n2\u201310; White 1967.)\n2.2 Language and Truth\n\nThe topic of this section is Austin\u2019s views about truth.\nAustin\u2019s views about truth are scattered throughout his work,\nbut his most explicit discussion of the topic is in the paper\n\u201cTruth\u201d (1950a) (see also 1953, 1954ms, 1956b, 1962b,\n1962c). Amongst the distinctive claims Austin makes about truth are\nthe following:\n\n(1)\nThe predicate \u201cis true\u201d has a descriptive function:\n    it serves to characterize the obtaining of a relation\n    between statements and facts (1950a:\n    117\u2013121).\n(2)\nThe facts that figure in determining whether or not a\n  statement is true are particulars, for example, things,\n  features, events, and states of affairs (1950a: 121\u2013124;\n  1954ms: passim).\n(3)\nThe relation between statements and facts that underwrites the\n  truth or falsity of statements is itself underwritten by relations\n  between sentences and types of fact, and between episodes of stating\n  and particular facts (1950a: 121\u2013133).\n(4)\nHuman judgment is involved in determining whether a particular\n    fact makes true a statement. And judgment is involved in a way\n    that is sensitive to the intents and purposes with which a\n    statement is made. For that reason, truth is not a simple relation\n    between types of sentences (given their meanings) and particular\n    facts. A pair of statements made using the same sentence with\n    respect to the same facts but on different occasions\u2014given\n    different intents and purposes\u2014might differ in truth-value\n    (1950a: 122 fn2; 1962a: 40\u201341, 62\u201377, 110\u2013111;\n    1962b: \n     142\u2013147).[3]\n(5)\nDespite (1), Austin appears to endorse a form\n    of deflationism about truth\u2014a view on which truth\n    is a thin or non-explanatory notion. According to this form of\n    deflationism, saying that a statement is true is just a way of\n    saying that the statement has one or another of a range of more\n    specific positive qualities\u2014for example, that it is\n    satisfactory, correct, fair, etc. (1950a: 130; 1956b:\n    250\u2013251; 1957: 180).\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with (1)\u2013(3). Austin 1950a is ostensibly\nresponding to a proposal in Strawson 1949 according to which the\nfunction of the predicate \u201cis true\u201d is to facilitate the\nperformance of acts of affirmation or agreement, and not to describe\nthings\u2014e.g., statements\u2014as possessing the property of\ntruth. For short, Strawson claimed that \u201cis true\u201d has a\nperformative rather than a descriptive function. And\nhe accused his opponents of committing the descriptive\nfallacy: the alleged fallacy of treating expressions, or aspects\nof the use of expressions, that really serve performative purposes as\nhaving (only) a descriptive\n purpose.[4]\n One of Austin\u2019s aims was to defend the view that the predicate\n\u201cis true\u201d has a descriptive function (perhaps in addition\nto its having one or more performative functions). In pursuing that\naim, Austin also made a number of distinctive proposals about the\ndescriptive function of the truth\n predicate.[5]\n\nLet\u2019s turn, then, to the core of Austin\u2019s account of\ntruth. Austin presents his account of truth as an account of truth for\nstatements. However, \u201cstatement\u201d is at least two\nways ambiguous, covering both historical episodes in which something\nis stated\u2014what I\u2019ll refer to as\nstatings\u2014and also the things or propositions that are\nstated therein\u2014which I\u2019ll refer to as what is\nstated. Austin isn\u2019t especially careful about the\ndistinction, but it\u2019s possible to reconstruct much of what he\nsays in a way that respects it (for discussion of the distinction see\ne.g., Cartwright 1962).\n\nAustin\u2019s primary interest appears to be the truth of\nstatings. He writes of \u201cstatement\u201d that it has\n\u201cthe merit of clearly referring to the historic use of a\nsentence by an utterer\u201d (1950a: 121). However, statings are not\nordinarily said to be true or false, except derivatively insofar as\nwhat is stated in them is true or false. Rather, statings are assessed\nas, for example, correct or incorrect, appropriate or inappropriate,\nand so forth. However, it is plausible that stating correctly is\nclosely associated with making a statement that is true. And\nAustin\u2019s account can be understood as an account of the\nconditions in which statings are such that what is stated in them is\n true.[6]\n\nAustin presents the core of his account of truth in the following\nway:\n\n\nWhen is a statement true? The temptation is to answer (at least if we\nconfine ourselves to \u201cstraightforward\u201d statements):\n\u201cWhen it corresponds to the facts\u201d. And as a piece of\nstandard English this can hardly be wrong. Indeed, I must confess I do\nnot really think it is wrong at all: the theory of truth is a series\nof truisms. Still, it can at least be misleading. (1950a: 121)\n\n\nThe two obvious sources of potential misdirection in the formula that\nAustin endorses here are its appeal to correspondence and its\nappeal to\n facts.[7]\n Austin attempts to prevent our being misled by explaining how those\ntwo appeals ought to be understood. Austin\u2019s focus in his\n\u201cTruth\u201d (1950a) is mainly on the nature of correspondence.\nHe deals more fully with facts in his \u201cUnfair to Facts\u201d\n(1954ms).\n\nIn giving an account of correspondence, Austin makes appeal to two\ntypes of (what he calls) conventions\n (as per (3) above):[8]\n\nDescriptive conventions. These correlate\nsentences with types of situation, thing, event,\netc., in the world.\n Demonstrative conventions. These correlate\nstatements (statings) with historic\n(particular, concrete) situations, things, events, etc., in the world.\n(1950a:\n 121\u2013122)[9]\n\n\nThe descriptive conventions associate sentences with (types\nof) ways for things to be: ways for situations, things, events, etc.\nto be. For instance, the sentence \u201cThe cat is on the mat\u201d\nis associated with a type of way for things to be in which the cat is\non the mat. A variety of different historic situations might be of\nthat type. For instance, one historic situation of that type might\ninvolve Logos (Derrida\u2019s cat), while a different historic\nsituation of the same type might involve Nothing (Sartre\u2019s cat).\nSimilarly, cat-mat pairings that took place at different times would\nbe different historic situations or events and yet might be of the\nsame type.\n\nThe demonstrative conventions, by contrast, associate\nparticular statings\u2014themselves historic events\u2014with some\namongst the accessible historic situations, things, events, etc.\nConsider, for example, the following simplified case. There are two\naccessible situations, one of which is of the cat-on-mat type and one\nof which is of the dog-on-linoleum type. The descriptive conventions\ngoverning the English sentence \u201cThe cat is on the mat\u201d do\nnot, and cannot, determine which of the two accessible situations a\nspeaker aims to talk about on a particular occasion. In order to\nachieve that, the speaker must find a way of making manifest that\ntheir goal is to select, say, the dog-on-linoleum situation. They\nmight achieve this by, for example, their use on a particular occasion\nof the present tense, or by pointing, etc. (1950a:\n 121\u2013126).[10]\n\nWith this machinery in place, Austin continues:\n\n\nA statement is said to be true when the historic state of affairs [or\ne.g., situation, thing, event] to which it is correlated by the\ndemonstrative conventions (the one to which it \u201crefers\u201d)\nis of a type [footnote omitted] with which the sentence used in making\nit is correlated by the descriptive conventions. (1950a: 122)\n\n\nWhat does \u201cis of a type with which\u201d mean? Austin expands\non his account in the omitted footnote:\n\n\n\u201cIs of a type with which\u201d means \u201cis sufficiently\nlike those standard states of affairs with which\u201d. Thus, for a\nstatement to be true one state of affairs must be like\ncertain others, which is a natural relation, but also\nsufficiently like to merit the same\n\u201cdescription\u201d, which is no longer a purely natural\nrelation. To say \u201cThis is red\u201d is not the same as to say\n\u201cThis is like those\u201d, nor even as to say \u201cThis is\nlike those which were called red\u201d. That things are\nsimilar, or even \u201cexactly\u201d similar, I may\nliterally see, but that they are the same I cannot literally\nsee\u2014in calling them the same colour a convention is involved\nadditional to the conventional choice of the name to be given to the\ncolour which they are said to be. (1950a: 122 fn.2)\n\n\nThe English sentence \u201cThis is red\u201d is correlated by the\ndescriptive conventions with a type of way for things to be: a type\ninstanced by all and only those historic situations or states of\naffairs in which a selected thing is red. According to Austin, a\nstating by use of that sentence would be correct if the thing selected\nin the stating via the demonstrative conventions were sufficiently\nlike standard situations or states of affairs in which a selected\nthing is red. So, we rely on the existence of a range of standard\ninstances that are assumed to be of the required type. We can see that\nthe thing selected in this stating, via the demonstrative conventions,\nis now in various ways similar and dissimilar from those standard\ninstances. The question we need to answer is this: Is this thing of\nthe same type as the standard instances with respect to its\ncolour? That is, is it the same colour as they are? According to\nAustin, we cannot answer that question simply by looking. In an at\nleast attenuated sense we must make a decision as to whether the\npresent instance is, in relevant respects, sufficiently\nsimilar to the standard instances as to mandate treating it as of the\nvery same\n type.[11]\n\nNotice that, on Austin\u2019s view, states of affairs (etc.) do not\nper se mandate that they belong to one or another type. To\nthat extent, they do not alone determine which propositional\nstatements are true of them. The things to which true statings\ncorrespond, then, are (in at least that sense) particulars\n (see (2) above).\n The things to which statings correspond, then, appear to be quite\ndifferent from facts as the latter are commonly understood by\nphilosophers. For facts are often thought of as\nproposition-like\u2014as exhaustively captured by instances of the\nform \u201cThe fact that p\u201d. And it seems that\nelements of that type would mandate the correctness of one or another\nclassification. Austin\u2019s views about facts are developed a bit\nmore fully in his \u201cUnfair to Facts\u201d (1954ms). There Austin\nmakes clear, first, that he uses \u201cfacts\u201d, with\netymological precedent, to speak of particulars. Second, Austin\nsketches a view of propositional fact talk on which it is used as a\nway of indirectly denoting particulars as the elements that make the\nspecified propositions true. However, Austin\u2019s basic account of\ntruth can for the most part be detached from his views about facts and\n fact-talk.[12]\n\nThe role for human judgment or decision in mediating the\nclassification of particulars leaves open that their correct\nclassification as to type might vary depending on specific features of\nthe occasion for so classifying them\n (see (4) above).\n It may be, for example, that for certain purposes an historic state\nof affairs involving a rose is sufficiently like standard situations\ninvolving red things as to warrant sameness of classification, while\nfor different purposes its likeness is outweighed by its\ndissimilarities from the standard cases. Moreover, what are counted as\nstandard cases may vary with the purposes operative in attempting to\nclassify, and may shift as new cases come to be counted as of a\nspecific\n type.[13]\n\nThe precise ways in which our statings depend for their correctness or\nincorrectness on the facts can vary with variation in specific\nfeatures of the occasion, in particular with variation in the intents\nand purposes of conversational participants. As Austin puts it,\n\n\nIt seems to be fairly generally realized nowadays that, if you just\ntake a bunch of sentences\u2026impeccably formulated in some\nlanguage or other, there can be no question of sorting them out into\nthose that are true and those that are false; for (leaving out of\naccount so-called \u201canalytic\u201d sentences) the question of\ntruth and falsehood does not turn only on what a sentence is,\nnor yet on what it means, but on, speaking very broadly, the\n\ncircumstances in which it is uttered. Sentences as such are\nnot either true or false. (1962a: 110\u2013111. See also 40\u201341,\n65)\n\n\nAnd the circumstances can matter in a variety of ways, not simply by\nsupplying, or failing to supply, an appropriate array of facts:\n\n\n\u2026in the case of stating truly or falsely, just as in the case\nof advising well or badly, the intents and purposes of the utterance\nand its context are important; what is judged true in a school book\nmay not be so judged in a work of historical research. Consider\n\u2026 \u201cLord Raglan won the battle of Alma\u201d, remembering\nthat Alma was a soldier\u2019s battle if ever there was one and that\nLord Raglan\u2019s orders were never transmitted to some of his\nsubordinates. Did Lord Raglan then win the battle of Alma or did he\nnot? Of course in some contexts, perhaps in a school book, it is\nperfectly justifiable to say so\u2014it is something of an\nexaggeration, maybe, and there would be no question of giving Raglan a\nmedal for it\u2026\u201cLord Raglan won the battle of Alma\u201d\nis exaggerated and suitable to some contexts and not to others; it\nwould be pointless to insist on its [i.e., the\nsentence\u2019s] truth or falsehood. (1962b: 143\u2013144,\ninterpolation added)\n\n\nIt\u2019s important here to separate two questions. First, is the\nsentence \u201cLord Raglan won the battle of Alma\u201d\ntrue? Second, is what is stated in using that sentence on a\nparticular occasion, true? In order for the first question to get an\naffirmative answer, every use of the sentence would have to\nbe\u2014or issue in a statement that\n is\u2014true.[14]\n But although the sentence can be used in a schoolbook to make a\nstatement that is true, it might also be used in a work of historical\nresearch, or in support of Raglan\u2019s decoration, in making a\nfalse statement. Hence, the sentence doesn\u2019t take the same\ntruth-value on every occasion: the sentence per se\nis neither true nor false. By contrast, there is no reason to deny\nthat the things that are stated in using the sentence on occasions are\ntrue: in particular, there is no reason to deny that what is stated by\nthe schoolbook occurrence of the sentence is true. So, the second\nquestion can be given an affirmative answer, as long as we are willing\nto allow that a sentence can be used to make different statements on\ndifferent occasions (see also Austin\u2019s discussion of\n\u201creal\u201d in Sense and Sensibilia (1962a:\n62\u201377) for an array of relevant examples).\n\nWe should avoid a possible misunderstanding of Austin here. His\nargument shows, at most, that whatever combines with the facts to\ndetermine a particular truth-value varies from occasion to occasion.\nThat does nothing to dislodge the natural view that a sentence can\ncarry its meaning with it from occasion to occasion, and thus\npossess a literal meaning. However, if we wish to retain that idea, we\nmust give up on the idea that sentence meaning simply combines with\nthe facts that are being spoken about to determine truth-value: we\nmust reject the idea that sentence meanings determine\ntruth-conditions. Plausibly, we should also give up the idea that\nmeaning alone determines what is stated (at least insofar as the\nlatter determines truth-conditions). In taking this line, we would\nreject views of meaning according to which it is given by appeal to\n truth-conditions.[15]\n\nAustin\u2019s account gives rise to the possibility of utterances in\nwhich no truth-evaluable statement is produced:\n\n\nSuppose that we confront \u201cFrance is hexagonal\u201d with the\nfacts, in this case, I suppose, with France, is it true or false?\nWell, if you like, up to a point; of course I can see what you mean by\nsaying that it is true for certain intents and purposes. It is good\nenough for a top-ranking general, perhaps, but not for a\ngeographer\u2026 How can one answer this question, whether it is\ntrue or false that France is hexagonal? It is just rough, and that is\nthe right and final answer to the question of the relation of\n\u201cFrance is hexagonal\u201d to France. It is a rough\ndescription; it is not a true or a false one. (1962b: 143)\n\n\nWhat Austin characterises in his final denial is the sentence\n\u201cFrance is hexagonal\u201d, in relation to France. He\nneedn\u2019t, and doesn\u2019t, deny that on occasion, for\nparticular intents and purposes, one might use the sentence to\nstate a truth. However, he suggests that, in some cases, the\ncircumstances of utterance may be such that no truth-evaluable\nstatement is made by the use of a sentence.\n\nSuppose, for example, that someone uttered \u201cFrance is\nhexagonal\u201d out of the blue, without making manifest any intents\nand purposes. In that case, there would be nothing to go on, in\nseeking to establish whether the utterance was true or false, other\nthan the words used, given their meanings. But those words might have\nbeen used to make a variety of statements, statements whose truth or\nfalsehood depends on the facts in a variety of ways. Hence, unless we\nare willing to allow that the utterance is both true and false, we\nshould withhold that mode of assessment: although such an utterance\nwould involve a perfectly meaningful sentence, it would fail\nto be either true or false. Austin thought that our uses of words are\nalways liable to that sort of failure, especially when we are doing\nphilosophy. When used in cases that are out of the ordinary, or in the\nabsence of the background required to sustain the statement of truths\nor falsehoods, words might\u2014in that sense\u2014fail us.\n\nAustin makes no claims to generality for the account of truth that he\nsketches. However, it\u2019s natural to wonder to what extent the\naccount can naturally be extended in order to take in types of\nstatement that he doesn\u2019t explicitly attempt to bring within its\npurview. Potential pressure points here include statements whose\nexpression involves negation (see 1950a: 128\u2013129, 129 fn.1),\nquantification (see 1962b: 144), or conditionals, and statements of\nnecessary truths. The three main options open to the defender of\nAustin here are the following. First, an attempt might be made to\nbring some cases within the purview of a natural generalization of\nAustin\u2019s account (see, for example, Warnock 1989: 56\u201361).\nSecond, it might be allowed that some such cases require distinctive\ntreatment, but argued that they can still be connected with the\naccount Austin offers as further species of the truth-genus. Third, an\nattempt might be made to argue that some such cases are so distinctive\nthat the forms of positive appraisal that are appropriate to them are\nnot really forms of appraisal as to\n truth.[16]\n\nLet\u2019s turn to\n (5),\n the question of the extent to which Austin endorses a deflationary\naccount of truth. The promiscuity of the classifier\n\u201cdeflationist\u201d has a tendency to render the question\ndifficult to discuss in a useful way. However, we can at least\nconsider some ways in which Austin might be thought to give an\nexplanatory role to truth, or to deny it such a role. It\u2019s clear\nthat Austin wishes to reject Strawson\u2019s very strong form of\ndeflationism, according to which the function of truth is exhaustively\nperformative: saying that a statement is true amounts, precisely, to\nendorsing that statement oneself. Moreover, there is no sign that\nAustin thinks an account can be given of the expression of statements\nby statings that isn\u2019t bound up with consideration of the\nconditions in which their stating would be subject to one or another\nform of positive appraisal\u2014at the most general level,\nconsideration of their correctness-conditions. However, Austin often\ncharacterizes truth and falsity themselves as, in effect, mere labels\nfor positive and negative poles, respectively, in a variety of more\nspecific forms of appraisal.\n\n\nWe become obsessed with \u201ctruth\u201d when discussing\nstatements, just as we become obsessed with \u201cfreedom\u201d when\ndiscussing conduct. So long as we think that what has always and alone\nto be decided is whether a certain action was done freely or was not,\nwe get nowhere: but so soon as we turn instead to the numerous other\nadverbs used in the same connexion (\u201caccidentally\u201d,\n\u201cunwillingly\u201d, \u201cinadvertently\u201d, &c.),\nthings become easier, and we come to see that no concluding inference\nof the form \u201cErgo, it was done freely (or not freely)\u201d is\nrequired. Like freedom, truth is a bare minimum or an illusory ideal\n(the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about, say, the\nbattle of Waterloo or the Primavera). (1950a: 130; see also\n1956b: 250\u2013251, 1957: 180)\n\n\nAustin\u2019s idea here seems to be the following. There are numerous\nspecific forms of positive appraisal that we employ with respect to\nstatings: they might be fair, reasonable, accurate, precise, adequate,\nsatisfactory and so forth. (Recall that Austin would have taken each\nform of assessment to be occasion-bound: a matter, for example, of\nwhat would be fair and reasonable to judge on this particular\noccasion.) In saying that what is stated in a stating is\ntrue, we are in effect saying that the stating meets the\n\u201cbare minimum\u201d condition of being susceptible to one or\nanother of those specific forms of positive appraisal. It\u2019s\nconsistent with this type of view that our conception of the natures\nof what we state, and of how our statings come to be expressions of\nthose things, is bound up with our conception of the conditions in\nwhich our statings, and what we thereby state, are susceptible to one\nor another form of positive appraisal. To that extent, it differs from\nsome stronger forms of deflationism on which no truth-related mode of\npositive appraisal plays a non-derivative explanatory role. Moreover,\nthe view can take more or less radical forms. Its most radical form\ntreats truth as a mere disjunction of the more specific modes of\npositive appraisal, with no uniform underlying commonality amongst\nthose specific modes. That view would be a distinctive form of\ndeflationism about truth, since it would reject the idea that truth\nper se plays an essential role in explanation. Its less\nradical form allows that truth might impose a uniform necessary\ncondition on the specific modes of positive appraisal, and thereby\nplay an essential role, through its government of the specific modes,\nin the explanation of what is stated in statings. The latter form of\nview wouldn\u2019t count as an interesting form of\ndeflationism, although it might well be an interesting\nposition in its own right.\n\nAustin discusses an important range of ways in which assessment as to\ntruth can cover a variety of more fine-grained modes of appraisal in\nhis \u201cHow to Talk\u201d (1953). See also the discussions of this\npaper in Chisholm 1964 and Warnock 1989: 47\u201356.\n\n(For discussion of Austin\u2019s account of truth, see Barwise and\nEtchemendy 1987; Bennett 1966; Crary 2002; Davidson 1969; Grice 1989:\n3\u201340; Hansen 2014; Kirkham 1995: 124\u2013140; Mates 1974;\nNarboux 2011; Putnam 1994; Recanati 1994: 1\u20135, 121\u2013130,\n141\u2013153; Searle 1966; Strawson 1950, 1965; Travis 1991, 2005,\n2008: 1\u201318, 2011; Warnock 1973c, 1989: 45\u201364,\n135\u2013145, 163\u20134 fn.74; White 1967; C.J.F. Williams\n1973.)\n2.3 Speech Acts and Truth\n\nIn this section, we\u2019ll consider some aspects of Austin\u2019s\ntreatment of speech acts\u2014things done with words (the main\nsources here are: 1962b, 1956b, and 1963; see also 1946: 97\u2013103,\n1950a: 130\u2013133, 1953). The topics we\u2019ll consider are the\nfollowing.\n\n(1) In his work on\nspeech acts, Austin presents a different reason for why sentences,\ngiven their meanings, do not combine with the facts to determine\ntruth-values. The second reason is based on the fact that any sentence\ncan be used in performing a variety of linguistic acts. Although in\nstating, we typically produce statements that are assessable as true\nor false, in performing other linguistic acts, we need not produce\nthings that are assessable in that way. The second reason depends,\nthen, on two sub-claims: first, that whether a sentence is used on an\noccasion to make a statement\u2014more generally, something\ntruth-assessable\u2014is dependent on more than just what it means;\nsecond, that some uses of sentences to perform linguistic acts other\nthan the making of statements are not properly assessable as true or\nfalse.\n(2)\nConnected with (1) is Austin\u2019s discussion of a distinction\nbetween constative utterances\u2014broadly, utterances of a\ntype suitable to be appraised as to truth\u2014and performative\nutterances\u2014broadly, utterances that are suitable only for\nother forms of appraisal (1962b: 1\u201393).\n(3)\nIn\naddition to discussing the putative constative-performative\ndistinction, Austin sketches a distinction amongst speech act types,\nbetween locutionary acts, illocutionary acts, and\nperlocutionary acts\u2014broadly, the distinction between\nsaying anything at all, saying something with a specific force (e.g.,\nmaking a statement, asking a question, making a request), and the\nfurther effects of saying something with a specific force (e.g.,\ngetting an audience to believe something, getting them to tell you\nsomething, or getting them to do what you request). The need to draw\nsuch a distinction is now very widely accepted and probably amounts to\nAustin\u2019s central contribution to more recent work (1962b:\n83\u2013164).\n(4)\n\nAustin makes some cryptic suggestions about the wider significance of\nhis discussion of topic (3), concerning their bearing on, for example,\nwhat he calls \u201cthe true/false fetish\u201d and \u201cthe\nvalue/fact fetish\u201d (1962b: 148\u2013164).\n\n\nA topic that has figured in some recent discussions, but that we\nwon\u2019t discuss here, is this:\n\n(5)In\nthe course of discussing his main topics, Austin sometimes makes use\nof a distinction between serious and non-serious\nuses of language, and suggests that non-serious uses of language are\nderivative from serious uses. (Roughly, the distinction is a\ngeneralisation of distinctions between genuine assertions and mock\nassertions in fiction or on the stage. See e.g., Austin 1962b: 104.)\nJacques Derrida challenged the standing of the distinction and the\npriority that Austin seemed to accord to some of what he counted as\nserious uses. John Searle responded to Derrida and the issue has\nbecome a source of some attempts at engagement between those\nsympathetic to Searle\u2019s more \u201cAnalytic\u201d approaches\nto issues in this area and those sympathetic to more\n\u201cContinental\u201d approaches. (See Derrida 1977 and Searle\n1977. For recent discussion of aspects of the controversy see de\nGaynesford 2009, A.W. Moore 2000, Richmond 1996, Ricks 1992.)\n\n\nAustin presents the second reason for why sentences do not conspire\nwith the facts to determine truth-values in considering whether there\nis a useful distinction to be drawn between (indicative) sentences\nthat are used to make statements\u2014which Austin labels\nconstatives\u2014and sentences that are useable in the\nperformance of some act\u2014which Austin labels\nperformatives (or sometimes performatory)\n (topic (2) above).[17]\n Austin\u2019s opening list of examples of putative performatives\nincludes: \u201cI take \u2026 to be my lawfully wedded\n\u2026\u201d\u2014as uttered in the course of the marriage\nceremony; \u201cI name this ship the Queen\nElizabeth\u201d\u2014as uttered when smashing a bottle against\nthe stern; \u201cI give and bequeath my watch to my\nbrother\u201d\u2014as occurring in a will; \u201cI bet you sixpence\nit will rain tomorrow\u201d (1962b: 5). About these examples, Austin\nwrites:\n\n\nIn these examples it seems clear that to utter the sentence (in, of\ncourse, the appropriate circumstances) is not to describe my\ndoing of what I should be said in so uttering to be doing\u2026[fn.\nStill less anything that I have already done or have yet to\ndo.]\u2026or to state that I am doing it. None of the utterances\ncited is either true or false: I assert this as obvious and do not\nargue it. (1962b: 6)\n\n\nAustin is sometimes read as seeking to defend this view of\nperformatives. However, four features of his presentation suggest that\nhis view is not so straightforward. First, Austin presents the issue\nas concerning the classification by use of utterances of types of\nsentence, and we have already seen that he is in general\nsceptical about alleged associations between sentences and their\noccasional uses. Second, Austin fails here, and elsewhere, to offer\nserious arguments for his assertion that none of the cited utterances\nis either true or false. Third, Austin\u2019s assertion is made using\nthe apparently performative form, \u201cI assert \u2026\n\u201d\u2014a form that appears, moreover, to falsify the\ngeneralisation that performatives lack truth-values. Finally, Austin\nissues the following warning in a footnote, two pages earlier:\n\u201cEverything said in these sections is provisional, and subject\nto revision in the light of later sections\u201d (1962b: 4 fn.1).\n\nAustin goes on to discuss two apparently quite different modes of\nassessment for utterances of the two apparently different types.\nConstatives, as already noted, are assessed along the dimension of\ntruth and falsehood. By contrast, performatives are assessed along\ndimensions of happiness and unhappiness, or\nfelicity and infelicity. Taking the example of an\nutterance of \u201cI take \u2026 to be my lawfully wedded \u2026\n\u201d, and simplifying Austin\u2019s discussion, there are two main\nsorts of unhappiness, or infelicity, to which this performative is\nliable. First, there are misfires:\n\n\n\u2026if we\u2026utter the formula incorrectly, or if\u2026we\nare not in a position to do the act because we are\u2026married\nalready, or it is the purser and not the captain who is conducting the\nceremony, then the act in question, \u2026marrying, is not\nsuccessfully performed at all, \u2026[it] is not achieved. (1962b:\n15\u201316)\n\n\nSecond, there are abuses: in these cases, the act is\nperformed, but insincerely, perhaps for example in instituting a\nmarriage of convenience.\n\nIt\u2019s important to see that, even if it were true, in general,\nthat some things done using performatives\u2014e.g., marrying,\nnaming, bequeathing, and betting\u2014are neither true nor false, but\nrather are subject to assessment as happy or unhappy, it would not\nfollow that truth is out of the picture. That would depend, not only\non the basic claim that actions of those types per se are not\ntrue or false, but also on the claim that particular actions of those\ntypes are not also of other types that are assessable as true\nor false. And Austin recognised that actions can be of more than one\ntype (or, perhaps, that distinct actions might be performed\nsimultaneously):\n\n\nTo say that I believe you \u2018is\u2019 on occasion to accept your\nstatement; but it is also to make an assertion, which is not made by\nthe strictly performatory utterance \u201cI accept your\nstatement\u201d. (1950a: 133)\n\n\nIn the examples that Austin cites, things are done that are not\nassessable as true or false\u2014marrying, naming, betting, etc. But\nas Austin points out, those examples might also involve other things\nbeing done\u2014e.g., the making of statements\u2014that are, or\ninvolve things that are, assessable as true or false. However, even\nthough this undermines Austin\u2019s provisional characterisation of\nperformatives, the possibility that we might sometimes do more than\none thing in using a performative puts pressure on the idea that there\nis a simple connection between sentences and the various things we do\nin using them.\n\nI\u2019ve suggested that Austin\u2019s view of the putative\ndistinction between performatives and constatives is less\nstraightforward than it might at first seem. And the structure of\nAustin (1962b) bears out that assessment. Although much of the book\nseems to be devoted to pursuit of a distinction between performatives\nand constatives, none of the attempts succeeds. It is possible, but\nimplausible, that in the course of the lectures Austin found that he\nwas unable to draw a distinction that he thought should be drawn. A\nmore plausible interpretation is that Austin\u2019s purpose is not to\ndraw such a distinction. Rather it is to argue\u2014through the\nfailures of various attempts to draw the distinction\u2014that there\nis no such simple distinction\u2014no sorting of sentences into those\napt for performative, and those apt for constative, use.\n\nAustin argues against the distinction by appeal to the fact that the\nsame forms of assessment are applicable to utterances apparently of\nboth sorts:\n\n\n\u2026unhappiness\u2026seems to characterize both kinds of\nutterance, not merely the performative; and\u2026the requirement of\nconforming or bearing some relation to the facts, different in\ndifferent cases, seems to characterize performatives\u2026 (1962b:\n91)\n\n\nAttempts to make a statement are liable both to misfires and abuses.\nFor example, an attempt to make a statement using \u201cFrance is\nhexagonal\u201d might misfire if there were no such country as\nFrance, or (as discussed above) if no suitable intents and purposes\nwere manifest (1962b: 47\u201352). And an attempt might be an abuse\nif the speaker failed to believe that France was hexagonal. Attempts\nat performative utterance are liable to assessment either in terms of\ntruth or falsehood, or in terms similarly dependent on conformity with\nthe facts: my utterance of \u201cI warn you that the bull is about to\ncharge\u201d may be liable to criticism as mistaken rather\nthan unhappy if the bull is not about to charge (1962b: 55). More\ngenerally, it is often impossible to decide, just from the words a\nspeaker uses, whether their utterance is susceptible to one or another\nform of assessment. And there are cases like \u201cI state that\n\u2026\u201d which seem to satisfy all formal and lexical\nrequirements for being performative, and yet are used in utterances\n\u201c\u2026which surely are the making of statements, and surely\nare essentially true or false\u201d (1962b: 91). (Austin\u2019s\nideas here also bear on\n topic (4) above.)\n\n(For discussion of Austin\u2019s views about performative utterances,\nsee Bach 1975; G. Bird 1981; Black 1963; Cohen 1964, 1974; Forguson\n1966; Heal 1974; Hornsby 1988, 2006; Jack 1981; Lemmon 1962; Lewis\n1972; Schiffer 1972; Sinnott-Armstrong 1994; Tsohatzidis 2018; Urmson 1977; Warnock\n1973b, 1989: 105\u2013151.)\n\nFrom the wreckage of the initial distinction, Austin assembles a new\nmodel\n (topic (3) above).\n The new model is founded on distinctions among various kinds of thing\nspeakers do\u2014various acts they perform\u2014when they\nproduce an utterance.\n\nThe locutionary act: the production of an utterance that\ncan be classified by its phonetic, grammatical, and lexical\ncharacteristics, up to sentence meaning (the phatic act). It\nis also the performance of an act that can be classified by its\ncontent (the rhetic act)\u2014a feature\ndistinctively of acts of speech. If I promise that I\u2019ll be\nhome for dinner and then promise that I\u2019ll work\nlate, my actions are instances of two different locutionary acts:\none with the content that I\u2019ll be home for dinner, and one with\nthe content that I\u2019ll work late (1962b: 94\u201398).\n The illocutionary act: an act classifiable not only by\nits content\u2014as with the locutionary act\u2014but also by its\nforce (stating, warning, promising, etc.). If I\npromise that I\u2019ll be home for dinner and later\nstate that I\u2019ll be home for dinner, my actions are\ninstances of the same locutionary act: both actions involve the\ncontent that I\u2019ll be home for dinner. However, my actions are\ninstances of different illocutionary acts: one has the force of a\npromise, while the other has the force of a statement (1962b:\n98\u2013101).\n The perlocutionary act: an act classifiable by its\n\u201c \u2026 consequential effects upon the feelings, thoughts, or\nactions of the audience, or of the speaker, or of other persons\n\u2026 \u201d. If I warn that the ice is thin, and so perform one\nillocutionary act, I may thereby perform a variety of perlocutionary\nacts: I may persuade someone to avoid it, or\nencourage someone to take a risk, and so forth (1962b:\n101).\n\n\nAustin\u2019s interest in the types of act so distinguished was\n\u201c\u2026essentially to fasten on the second, illocutionary act\nand contrast it with the other two\u2026\u201d (1962b: 103). What\ndid Austin think was important about the illocutionary act? And what\ndid he think were the dangers inherent in failing to mark it off from\nthe other types?\n\nAustin appears to have thought that the various modes of assessment\nthat he discusses\u2014e.g., true/false, happy/unhappy\u2014apply\nmost fundamentally to the illocutionary act, rather than the\nlocutionary or the perlocutionary\n act.[18]\n One point is that Austin thought that philosophers have had a\ntendency to view some assessments as to happiness (or felicity) as\nreally applying to perlocutionary acts, so as not bearing on the\nspecifically linguistic things that speakers are up to. Another\npoint\u2014and perhaps the point of primary importance\u2014is that\nAustin thought that philosophers have had a tendency to view\nassessments as to truth as applying most fundamentally to locutionary\nacts. Moreover, he thought that philosophers had conceived locutionary\nacts, not as abstractions from illocutionary acts, but rather as\nthings that might be done without any illocutionary purpose, just by\nvirtue of the linguistic expressions employed or their meanings. By\ncontrast, Austin held that locutionary acts are abstracted from\ninstances of illocutionary acts, and that assessment as to truth is\ndirected most fundamentally to the illocutionary act. (We\u2019ll\nconsider below a stronger and a weaker reading of the idea that\nassessment as to truth applies most fundamentally to the illocutionary\nact.)\n\nFor Austin, then, assessment as to truth is of a piece with various\nforms of assessment as to happiness, etc., and like those forms it is\nthe assessment of an act with respect to its goodness or badness. Thus\nAustin\u2019s discussion of illocutionary acts is bound up with his\nother discussions of the ways in which assessment of utterances as to\ntruth is dependent upon specific features of the circumstances of\nutterance. He writes:\n\n\nThe truth or falsity of statements is affected by what they leave out\nor put in and by their being misleading, and so on. Thus, for example,\ndescriptions, which are said to be true or false or, if you like, are\n\u201cstatements\u201d, are surely liable to these criticisms, since\nthey are selective and uttered for a purpose. It is essential to\nrealize that \u201ctrue\u201d and false\u2019, like\n\u201cfree\u201d and \u201cunfree\u201d, do not stand for anything\nsimple at all; but only for a general dimension of being a right and\nproper thing to say as opposed to a wrong thing, in these\ncircumstances, to this audience, for these purposes and with these\nintentions. (1962b: 144\u2013145)\n\n\nAccording to Austin, there is more involved in any such assessment\nthan a simple comparison of requirements imposed by linguistic meaning\nwith the facts. Reflection on the assessment of actions in which we\nspeak and the speech acts that classify them indicates two things:\nfirst, the distinction between assessment as to happiness and\nassessment as to truth is ultimately unprincipled; and, second, some\nmixture of various types of assessment applies to all, or nearly all,\nutterances. These ideas appear to be the basis for a cryptic claim of\nAustin\u2019s\n (mentioned above as topic (4)).\n Exploiting the various modes of appraisal to distinguish five very\ngeneral classes of speech act verbs, Austin writes that\n\n\nThey are\u2026quite enough to play Old Harry with two fetishes which\nI admit to an inclination to play Old Harry with, viz. (1) the\ntrue/false fetish, (2) the value/fact fetish. (1962b: 151)\n\n\nAustin\u2019s cryptic suggestion appears to be to the effect that, in\none or another way, classifications of utterances along the true-false\ndimension, or according to whether they are expressions of fact or\nexpressions of value, is\u2014for at least some purposes\u2014too\ncrude. The suggestion is susceptible of a weaker and a stronger\nreading. On the weaker reading, the suggestion is to the effect that,\nwhen the assessment of an utterance is at issue, it is\nessential to consider the force or forces that attach to the\nillocutionary act or acts thereby performed. Since various such acts\nmay have been performed, and since assessment of each act involves\nconsideration of a mix of facts and values, there is no clean way of\nsorting utterances on the basis either of whether or not their primary\nmode of assessment is on the true-false dimension, or of whether their\nprimary function is the expression of fact, rather than the expression\nof value. That leaves open that, with respect to at least some speech\nacts, a locutionary core\u2014a proposition, or propositions, or\npropositional-like element\u2014may be assessed in a way that makes\nno reference to force, for example, along the true-false dimension. On\nthe stronger reading, the claim would be that it is not possible to\ndetach a locutionary core from the force with which it is expressed in\nsuch a way that that core can be assessed without reference to force.\nOn its stronger reading, Austin\u2019s suggestion would have to\ncontend with an aspect of what is known as the Frege-Geach\nproblem: the challenge of explaining logical connections amongst\nspeech acts with different forces where those connections appear to\ndepend upon their sharing (elements of) a locutionary core (see Geach\n1965).\n\n(For discussion of Austin\u2019s distinction amongst locutionary,\nillocutionary, and perlocutionary acts see Bach 1975; Bach and Harnish\n1979; G.

Knowledge and Perception\n\nAustin\u2019s main discussions of knowledge and perception take place\nin \u201cOther Minds\u201d (1946) and Sense and Sensibilia\n(1962a; see also \u201cUnfair to Facts\u201d [1954ms], which\noverlaps with parts of the lecture series on which Sense and\nSensibilia was based that are excised from the book, and\n\u201cIfs and Cans\u201d [1956a:\n 230]).[19]\n Stated more baldly than would have been acceptable to Austin, and\nreconstructing slightly, his distinctive views in this area include\nthe following.\n\n(1)\n\nKnowledge is a basic form of apprehension of how things are, rather\nthan a hybrid of belief conjoined with additional conditions. Knowing\nprovides a sort of guarantee about one\u2019s environment. That is,\nin at least some sense, the following is true: \u201cIf you know, you\ncan\u2019t be wrong.\u201d What a subject\u2019s knowledge\nguarantees can include truths about the environment that are\nindependent of the subject (1946: 77\u201378, 84\u2013103; 1962a:\n104\u2013131). Austin\u2019s commitment to (1) aligns him with the\ntradition of \u201cOxford Realism\u201d (see Travis and Kalderon\n2013; Marion 2000a,b, 2009; Martin ms (Other Internet Resources);\nWilliamson 2000).\n(2)\n\nKnowledge arises through the successful exercise of judgmental\ncapacities in propitious circumstances\u2014that is, through a\ncombination of acumen and opportunity (1946:\n79\u201397; 1962a: 20\u201361).\n(3)\nLike\nall other human capacities, human judgmental capacities are inherently\nlimited and fallible. The capacities are inherently limited in that\nthere are bound to exist cases with respect to which they are\ninsufficiently reliable to give rise to knowledge. And they are\ninherently fallible in that, even in the most propitious\ncircumstances, it is possible that their exercise is unsuccessful.\n(The risk of fallibility is liable to increase, of course, as the\ncapacities approach the limits within which their application is\nreliable.) (1946: 90\u201397; 1962a: 104\u2013131)\n(4)\nThe\nfact that capacities that are essentially involved in the acquisition\nof knowledge are inherently limited and fallible is consistent with\ntheir operating successfully in a variety of circumstances so as to\ngive rise to knowledge (1946: 83\u2013103; 1962a:\n104\u2013131).\n\n\nA consequence of (3) and (4) is that foundationalism is\nundercut: there are no foundational claims that are especially\ninfallible; and there are no non-foundational claims that are\ndistinctively fallible. It is possible for our judgmental capacities\nto misfire with respect to any subject matter, including e.g., our own\nfeelings or experiences. And it\u2019s possible for their exercise to\nbe sufficiently reliable to give rise to knowledge about ordinary\nmatters, e.g., that there is a pig before one.\n\n(5)\nIn\norder for exercises of capacities to make perception-based judgments\nto sustain knowledge about the subject-independent environment,\nperception must put the perceiver in contact with that environment,\nrather than being restricted in its reach to sense-data\n(1946: 86\u201397, 1962a: 10). Again, this commitment aligns Austin\nwith \u201cOxford Realism\u201d (see Hinton 1973; Travis and\nKalderon 2013; Marion 2000a,b, 2009; Martin ms (Other Internet\nResources), 1997; Snowdon 1981).\n(6)\nSome\nstandard forms of argument that perception cannot put the perceiver in\nthe required type of contact with their environment\u2014arguments\nthat have been presented in support of the claim that our basic form\nof perceptual contact is with sense-data (e.g., the so-called\n\u201cargument from illusion\u201d)\u2014are, at best, unconvincing\n(1962a: passim).\n\n\nThree further side claims that have assumed some importance in recent\nwork are the following.\n\n(7) \nAustin\nstresses that being told something by someone who\nknows it can put one in a position to know that thing (1946:\n81\u201383, 97\u2013103, 114\u2013115).\n(8)\n\nConnected with (7), Austin sketches a view on which claims to the\neffect that someone knows something can serve as assurances,\non the basis of which others are entitled to act, form beliefs, or\nclaim to know (1946: 97\u2013103).\n(9)\n\nAustin sketches a view on which utterances of the form \u201cI know\nthat such-and-such\u201d serve a performative and\nnot a descriptive function. According to this view,\nthe function of \u201cI know\u201d is very similar to the function\nof \u201cI promise\u201d: both serve as ways of giving one\u2019s\nword, the first (typically) about how things are, the second\n(typically) about how one intends them to be (1946:\n97\u2013103).\n\n3.1 Knowledge\n\nLet\u2019s begin with some of what Austin says in support of\n (1).\n In his \u201cOther Minds\u201d (1946), Austin sketches a\ndistinction between knowing and believing through appeal to the\ndifferent kinds of challenges that are appropriate to claims to know\nversus claims to believe. First, Austin points out that one who claims\nto know may be challenged to explain how they know, while\nsomeone who claims to believe may be challenged to explain\nwhy they believe. The consequences of failing adequately to\nmeet those challenges are also different: in the first case, the\nconsequences might include that the subject does not know; in\nthe second, the consequence might include, not the subject\ndoesn\u2019t believe, but that they oughtn\u2019t\nto believe. Later, Austin indicates a further basis for the\ndistinction between knowing and believing:\n\n\n\u2026saying \u201cI know\u201d\u2026is not saying\n\u201cI have performed a specially striking feat of cognition,\nsuperior, in the same scale as believing and being sure, even to being\nquite sure\u201d: for there is nothing in that scale\nsuperior to being quite sure. (1946: 99)\n\n\nImportantly, and moving on to claim\n (2),\n Austin holds that knowledge is the upshot of the successful exercise\nof judgmental capacities\u2014which he thinks of as essentially\nlanguage involving\u2014in appropriate circumstances: the successful\nexercise of (judgmental) acumen given (perception- or\ntestimony-based) opportunity. The following two passages are\ncentral to understanding Austin\u2019s views in this area:\n\n\nAny description of a taste or sound or smell (or colour) or of a\nfeeling, involves (is) saying that it is like one or some that we have\nexperienced before: any descriptive word is classificatory, involves\nrecognition and in that sense memory, and only when we use such words\n(or names or descriptions, which come down to the same) are we knowing\nanything, or believing anything. But memory and recognition are often\nuncertain and unreliable. (1946: 92).\n\n\u2026sensa [the things we sense or perceive] are dumb, and only\nprevious experience enables us to identify them. If we choose\nto say that they \u201cidentify themselves\u201d (and certainly\n\u201crecognizing\u201d is not a highly voluntary act of ours), then\nit must be admitted that they share the birthright of all speakers,\nthat of speaking unclearly and untruly. (1946: 97)\n\n\nWe perceive various things, features, events, and states of affairs.\nThe things we perceive are not presented to us as already classified\ninto types. Yet propositional knowledge essentially involves\nclassification: for example, we know that that thing is a\npig. In order to know, we must exercise judgmental capacities,\ntaking stands with respect to the ways the things, features, events,\nand states of affairs are. We must classify the elements into types\nbased on their similarities with elements that we have already\nclassified into types. (Notice that Austin\u2019s view that these\nelements are particulars, articulated in his \u201cTruth\u201d\n(1950a) and \u201cUnfair to Facts\u201d (1954ms), figures\nessentially here.)\n\nReturning to\n (1),\n let\u2019s consider what Austin says about the conditions in which a\nsubject would fail to know. Austin\u2019s discussion is\nhaunted by the following condition: \u201cIf I know, I\ncan\u2019t be wrong\u201d. He never quite endorses the\ncondition. He admits at one point that its third person counterpart\nmakes sense, but characterizes the sense it makes by appeal\nto a prohibition on saying \u201cI know it is so, but I may\nbe wrong\u201d (1946: 98).\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Austin would reject the claim that it is a\nnecessary condition on knowing that it be impossible for one\nto have been wrong\u2014impossible, that is, for one to have\nexercised the same capacities in the same circumstances and to have\njudged incorrectly. For given that he holds that judgmental capacities\nare inherently fallible\n ((3) above),\n it would follow that we can never know anything.\n\n\nThe human intellect and senses are, indeed, inherently\nfallible and delusive, but not inveterately so. Machines are\ninherently liable to break down, but good machines don\u2019t\n(often). It is futile to embark on a \u201ctheory of knowledge\u201d\nwhich denies this liability: such theories constantly end up by\nadmitting the liability after all, and denying the existence of\n\u201cknowledge\u201d. (1946: 98)\n\n\nWhat Austin says here is consistent with the operation of the\ncapacities being reliable in some circumstances, and with their\nreliable operation being such as to give rise to knowledge. So it is\nopen to Austin to hold a view on which knowledge requires that the\nparticular exercises of the capacity to judge on which they\nare based couldn\u2019t have occurred and yet the output judgment be\nmistaken. And it is open to him to hold that if the exercise of\njudgmental capacities is to give rise to knowledge, those capacities\nmust be reliable in the circumstances in which they are\nexercised and given the way they are exercised on that occasion (e.g.,\ncarefully). However, Austin doesn\u2019t make fully explicit that his\nview about knowledge includes either component. And some of what he\nsays\u2014especially in discussion of his performative proposal about\nthe use of \u201cI know\u201d\u2014is in tension with the first\nclaim, on which knowing is incompatible with being\n mistaken.[20]\n (It\u2019s possible that Austin viewed his \u201cIfs and\nCans\u201d (1956a) discussion of abilities as providing further\nillumination concerning the proper understanding of the formula\n\u201cIf one knows, one can\u2019t be wrong\u201d.)\n\nOne potential consequence of Austin\u2019s account concerns\nfoundationalism. Foundationalism typically involves the following\nthree claims. First, many of the ordinary judgments that we\nmake\u2014for example, judgments to the effect that there is a pig\nhere\u2014are inherently risky in the following sense. It\u2019s\npossible for us to make such judgments mistakenly, even in cases in\nwhich we operate as carefully as possible. Second, some of the\njudgments we make, or could make, are not inherently risky: for\nexample, where we are careful only to judge about how things presently\nappear to us, the judgments we make carry no risk of error. Third,\nthen, if our aim is to achieve absolute security, we should avoid\njudgments of the first sort except insofar as they are securely based\nupon judgments of the second sort. (On one view of this type, the\nsecond sort of judgment would be taken to provide evidence on\nwhich judgments of the first sort are based.) Austin\u2019s account\nundermines the first two components of this view. The first component\nis undermined because, although it is always possible to\njudge incorrectly, there are ordinary cases in which our judgments\nabout our environment are, in fact, absolutely secure\n ((4) above):\n\n\n\u2026if I watch or some time an animal a few feet in front of me,\nin a good light, if I prod it perhaps, and sniff, and take note of the\nnoises it makes, I may say, \u201cThat\u201ds a pig\u2019; and this\ntoo will be \u201cincorrigible\u201d, nothing could be produced that\nwould show that I had made a mistake\u2026if the animal then emerges\nand stands there plainly in view, there is no longer any question of\ncollecting evidence; its coming into view doesn\u2019t provide me\nwith more evidence that it\u2019s a pig, I can now just see\nthat it is, the question is settled. (1962a: 114\u2013115)\n\n\nThe second component is undermined because there is no type\nof judgment, and no type of subject matter, with respect to\nwhich error is impossible\n ((3) above).\n In order to have propositional knowledge even about what I am\nexperiencing right now, I must classify it together with other things\nof the same type. And that requires the exercise of capacities that\nare inherently fallible: I may not have had enough experiences of\nthings of the same sort to classify this one securely; I may not have\nattended to what I am experiencing with sufficient care; I may fail\nadequately to remember similar things that I experienced earlier; and\nso forth (1946: 90\u201397; 1962a: 104\u2013131).\n\nOrdinary challenges to judgments or claims, including claims to know,\nare sometimes invitations to detail our credentials\u2014our\npossession of appropriate acumen in making judgments of the type in\nquestion. Sometimes, however, they are invitations to detail our\nfacts\u2014the features of the circumstance that figure in\nour judging in the way that we do. For example, we might claim to know\nthat that presented thing is a goldfinch \u201cby the shape of its\nhead\u201d. If we were to detail our facts in that sort of way, then\nwe might be open to further challenge: someone might claim that\nthat\u2019s not enough of a basis on which to judge that the\npresented thing is a goldfinch. In addition to emphasizing the role of\nspecial acumen in this type of case\u2014not just anyone can tell a\ngoldfinch by the shape of its head\u2014Austin makes two important\nclaims about such potential challenges to our facts. First, Austin\nclaims that, in order for such a challenge to be appropriate, the\nchallenger must have in mind some more or less definite lack, for\nexample by pointing out that birds other than goldfinches have heads\nof that shape. Second, Austin writes:\n\n\nEnough is enough: it doesn\u2019t mean everything. Enough means\nenough to show that (within reason, and for present intents and\npurposes) it \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d be anything else, there is no\nroom for an alternative, competing description of it. It does not\nmean, for example, enough to show it isn\u2019t a stuffed\ngoldfinch. (1946: 84.)\n\n\nThere are at least three, non-exclusive ways of reading Austin\u2019s\nclaim here. The first is as the claim that what suffices for this\nhere to be a goldfinch may not be enough with respect to anything\nin any circumstance. There may be other birds, or other things, with\nheads of the same shape. However, we might still know full well that\nthere are no such birds, and no such things, here; or we may know\nenough about this thing to know it isn\u2019t a bird of that sort, or\none of those other things, even though we haven\u2019t specified how\nwe know in answer to the initial challenge. That is, we may know that\nthis isn\u2019t a stuffed goldfinch\u2014given the rest of\nwhat we know, and the circumstances in which we judge\u2014even\nthough what we explicitly point to in answer to challenges\ndoesn\u2019t alone rule out the possibility. The second way of\nreading Austin here is as allowing that we can know that this is a\ngoldfinch, even though we know that if it\u2019s a stuffed goldfinch,\nthen it is not a goldfinch, and we don\u2019t know that it\nisn\u2019t a stuffed goldfinch. We are entitled\u2014either in\ngeneral, or in circumstances of this sort\u2014to assume or rely upon\nits not being a stuffed goldfinch, even though that is something we\ncan\u2019t rule out and don\u2019t know (see Kaplan 2011 for\ndevelopment of the second way of reading Austin\u2019s views in this\narea). The third way of reading the passage is as claiming that the\nrange of possibilities can vary from occasion to occasion for\njudging or claiming that one knows that this is a goldfinch. On the\nthird reading, it might be impossible, on this occasion, for\nthe presented thing to be a stuffed goldfinch, even though there are\nother occasions on which it would be a possibility. Hence, our facts\ndo not need to foreclose on that possibility on this occasion,\nalthough there might be other occasions on which our facts would need\nto do so. (Travis 2005 develops the third approach. See Millar 2005\nfor objections.)\n\nLet\u2019s turn, then, to\n (7)\u2013(9),\n focusing attention on\n (9),\n the view that utterances of the form \u201cI know that\nsuch-and-such\u201d serve a performative and not a descriptive\nfunction. This is puzzling for at least two reasons: first, the claim\nthat \u201cI know\u201d lacks a descriptive function is apt to seem\nobviously false; and second, it is unclear what, if any, function the\nclaim has in Austin\u2019s account as a whole.\n\nThe main focus of objection to Austin here isn\u2019t the claim that\n\u201cI know that such-and-such\u201d can, on occasion, serve\ndistinctive performative functions. Rather, the concern with\nAustin\u2019s proposal is focused on two more specific claims. First,\nit is focused on the claim that \u201cI know that\nsuch-and-such\u201d always and only serves a distinctive performative\nfunction and so is never at the service of self-description. Second,\nit is focused on the claim that, in cases in which \u201cI know that\nsuch-and-such\u201d is used to serve a performative function, neither\nthe felicity conditions of using the sentence in that way, nor the\ntruth of what, if anything, one thereby states, depend in turn on\nwhether the speaker knows that such-and-such.\n\nAustin is misled here, I think, due to three factors. First, he is\nmisled by similarities between saying \u201cI know that\nsuch-and-such\u201d and saying \u201cI promise that\nsuch-and-such\u201d or \u201cI swear that such-and-such\u201d. But\nthe cases are importantly different. For example, unlike the case of\npromising, in which saying \u201cI promise\u2026\u201d in\nappropriate circumstances makes it so that one has promised\u2026,\nsaying \u201cI know that such-and-such\u201d does not make it so\nthat one knows. Now, as Austin later saw, it is possible to develop an\naccount on which saying \u201cI know that such-and-such\u201d can\nserve more than one purpose and so can function well with respect to\none such purpose while functioning poorly with respect to others (see\ne.g., 1950a: 133 and 1962b). Accordingly, it would be possible to\ndevelop a view on which, for example, saying \u201cI know that\nsuch-and-such\u201d in cases in which one does not know\nwould be improper qua statement (since saying it\ndoesn\u2019t remove the deficit by making it so that one knows),\nwhile properly serving the purpose of giving an audience one\u2019s\nassurance. However, and this is the second reason for which Austin is\nmisled, he had not in \u201cOther Minds\u201d (1946) yet attained\nthe later perspective on which that is a clear possibility. Since he\nnonetheless believes that \u201cI know that such-and-such\u201d\nserves purposes other than statement making, he is forced to efface\nits statement-making function. Finally, and more speculatively, it\nseems that Austin is misled due to his attempting to build into his\naccount a response to a doctrine, common to his Oxford Realist\npredecessors Cook Wilson and Prichard, according to which whether one\nknows or merely believes something is transparent to one. (For\ndiscussion of that feature of Cook Wilson\u2019s and Prichard\u2019s\nviews, see Longworth 2018b, Travis and Kalderon 2013 and Travis 2005.) Although Austin\nrejects the letter of the doctrine, he retains its spirit in\nattempting to provide an account on which avowals of the form \u201cI\nknow that such-and-such\u201d can never be false. (For further\ndiscussion of Austin\u2019s performative proposal, see Warnock 1989:\n24\u201333, Lawlor 2013.)\n\n(For critical engagement with Austin\u2019s work on knowledge, see\nAyer 1967; Baz 2011; Chisholm 1964; Hetherington 2018; Kaplan 2011, 2018; Lawlor 2013, 2018; Leite 2011; Longworth 2018b, Marion 2000a,b; Martin ms (Other\nInternet Resources); Millar 2005; Putnam 1994; Soames 2003:\n171\u2013193; Stroud 1984: 39\u201382; Travis 2005; Travis and Kalderon 2013; Warnock 1989:\n32\u201344; M. Williams 1996: 135\u2013171.)\n3.2 Sensory perception\n\nLet\u2019s turn now to Austin\u2019s views specifically about\nperception\n ((5) and (6) above).\n Once we have detailed the facts on which a perception-based judgment\nof ours relies, a more general challenge arises concerning our access\nto those facts. In order to exploit the bird\u2019s head shape as the\nbasis for our judgment that it is a goldfinch, it is arguable that we\nmust be able to see (or perhaps feel) the bird and its shape. On some\nviews of perception, however, birds and their shapes are not amongst\nthe things that one can perceive. Austin\u2019s main aim in Sense\n& Sensibilia is to undermine considerations that have been\noffered in favour of the general doctrine that, as he puts it,\n\n\n\u2026we never see or otherwise perceive (or \u201csense\u201d),\nor anyhow we never directly perceive or sense, material\nobjects (or material things), but only sense-data (or our own ideas,\nimpressions, sense, sense-perceptions, percepts, &c.). (1962a:\n2)\n\n\nCentral to those considerations are those organized by versions of\nwhat is known as the argument from illusion\n ((6) above).[21]\n The version of the argument that Austin criticizes can be\nreconstructed as follows. (i) There are cases of illusion in which we\nhave a sensory experience as of seeing something of some sort with\nspecific features but in which nothing has those specific features.\nThis might be because, although we experience something of the sort in\nquestion, the thing we experience lacks the features in question; or\nit might be because we don\u2019t experience a thing of the sort in\nquestion at all. (ii) In those cases, there must be something we\nexperience that has the features in question. Call the things we\nexperience in such cases sense-data. (iii) Since the cases in\nwhich we experience sense-data include cases in which no material\nthings of the sort in question, or with the features in question, are\nexperienced, it follows that sense-data are not (in general) material\nthings, or elements in the environment independent of the individual\nexperiencer. It follows that, in the cases in question, we experience\nthings (or directly experience things) that are distinct from\nmaterial things and we do not thereby experience (or directly\nexperience) material things. (iv) Now it is a general principle about\nexperiences that if we cannot discriminate the objects of two\nexperiences on the basis of introspection, then those experiences must\nhave objects of the same sort. Hence, if one experience has only\nsense-data as its objects, and not material things, and a second\nexperience has as its objects something that we cannot discriminate on\nthe basis of introspection from the objects of the first experience,\nthen the second experience also has sense-data rather than material\nthings as its objects. (v) Since every experience stands in the\nrequired relation to an experience with only sense-data as its\nobjects, every experience has sense-data rather than material things\nas its objects. Hence, we never experience\u2014or never\ndirectly experience\u2014material things\n\nAustin objects to every step in the argument just reconstructed.\nAmongst other complaints, he argues that key terms in the argument\nhave not been properly defined or explained\u2014for instance,\n\u201cmaterial thing\u201d and \u201csense-data\u201d (1962a: 4,\n7\u201314, 55), and \u201cdirectly\u201d (1962a: 14\u201319). And\nhe objects to the general principle, to which appeal was made in (iv),\npointing out that there are no grounds for thinking that we cannot\nhave experiences with different kinds of object that we nonetheless\ncan\u2019t discriminate on the basis of introspection. For instance,\nwe might experience a bar of soap that looks just like a lemon, and be\nin a position where we couldn\u2019t discriminate the soap from the\nlemon on the basis of introspection. Nonetheless, we would hold that\nthe two experiences have different kinds of objects (1962a:\n 50\u201352).[22]\n However, what are perhaps his most important complaints target (i)\nand (ii) by exploiting the distinction, initially articulated in\n\u201cOther Minds\u201d (1946), between two elements in perceptually\nbased judgment: the opportunity afforded by sensory perception and\njudgmental acumen.\n\nThe distinction between sensory perception and judgmental acumen\nenables Austin to distinguish between central cases of\nillusion and central cases of delusion, and also to\nsketch explanations of what is going on in those cases that do not\nmake appeal to sense-data. Austin takes the defender of (i) and (ii)\nto argue as follows. First, consider an illusion, for example a stick\nthat looks bent but really isn\u2019t. Such an illusion has two key\nfeatures. First, it clearly involves a distinctive sensory experience.\nSecond, the distinctive sensory experience that it involves is apt to\ngive rise to an erroneous perceptual judgment, to the effect that the\nstick is bent. Now one way of explaining the erroneous perceptual\njudgment is to view it as dictated by the sensory\nexperience\u2014that is, to view it as accurately representing\nfeatures presented in the experience: the bent-ness of that which is\nexperienced. Since the stick is not in fact bent, and that\nwhich is experienced is bent, we have reason to claim that\nthat which is experienced is not identical with the stick. What we\nexperience is sense-data rather than a stick. Moreover, we\nmight also consider more extreme cases in which we make erroneous\nperceptual judgments: cases of delusion or hallucination. For example,\nthere is the case in which an alcoholic person judges that pink rats\nare visible, when in fact there are none. Now, given the proposed\naccount of the case of illusion, that case cannot be distinguished\nfrom the case of delusion by appeal to the fact that, in the former,\nan environmental feature is experienced while, in the latter, there is\nno suitable environmental feature to be experienced. It therefore\nseems natural to treat the two cases as of the same basic type, and to\noffer the same type of explanation for both. Thus, one might be\ntempted to view the rat-delusion as having the following three\nfeatures. First, it involves a distinctive sensory experience. Second,\nthe distinctive sensory experience that it involves dictates\nan erroneous perceptual judgment to the effect that pink rats are\nvisible. Third, that judgment is dictated because it accurately\nrepresents features present in the experience.\n\nAustin responds as follows. First, he exploits the role of judgmental\nacumen in perceptual judgment in order to provide an alternative\nexplanation of cases of illusion (or more generally of things looking\nways that they are not). He allows that some things really do\nlook the way they are sometimes taken to be\u2014the stick\nlooks bent, even though it is not in fact bent. But he holds that\nthose looks are not private features of individual\u2019s\nexperiences. For example, they are available to other perceivers and\nmight be recorded in a photograph. (Austin discusses talk about how\nthings look, and distinguishes it from talk about how things\nseem\u2014which he associates with judgment rather than with\nexperience, in Sense and Sensibilia (1962a: 33\u201343). See\nalso Jackson 1977: 30\u201349; Martin 2010; Travis 2004.) However,\nthe way the stick looks, just as much as features like the\nstick\u2019s straightness, can be the basis for perceptual judgments.\nWe can explain why someone is prone to judge that the stick is bent by\nappeal to the stick\u2019s looking bent, rather to\nanything\u2019s being bent, together with the ways in which exercises\nof judgmental acumen can respond erroneously to looks. More generally,\nthere needn\u2019t be anything in particular\u2014any specific\nfeature of what is experienced or any specific look\u2014that figures\nin explaining why individuals are prone to make a specific type of\njudgment on the basis of the experience. For the explanation for each\nindividual\u2019s judgment will depend, not only on what they\nexperience, but also on the types of judgmental capacities that they\nhave. In support of this form of explanation, Austin notes that not\neveryone would be inclined to judge that the stick is bent. For\nexample, noting the presence of water, those whose judgmental\ncapacities are sufficiently well trained might withhold judgment about\nthe stick\u2019s shape (Hinton 1973: 114ff includes a useful\ndiscussion of some of Austin\u2019s claims about illusions).\n\nStandard cases of illusion or misleading appearance of the sort\nwe\u2019ve just considered involve sensory experiences of ordinary\nthings and their features, including their looks, feels, and so forth.\nHowever, because the connection between what is experienced and what\none judges on its basis is not straightforward\u2014because\njudgmental acumen is involved in moving from one to the\nother\u2014there is no general way to read back from the judgments\nsomeone is prone to make to specific features of their sensory\nexperiences. Because such cases of illusion involve experience of\nordinary things, while standard cases of delusion do not, we thus have\na ground on which to distinguish the two sorts of case. For example,\nwe have grounds to distinguish the case in which someone erroneously\njudges that a submerged stick is bent from the case of the alcoholic\nperson who judges that pink rats are visible. But having distinguished\nthe cases in that way, we are liable to become open to two new\nquestions. First, should we allow that the judgment in the delusory\ncase is based on sensory experience? Perhaps, for example, some cases\nof delusion involve dysfunction in the systems responsible for\nperceptual judgment of a sort that give rise to perceptual judgments\nin the absence of any sense-experiential basis for those judgments.\nSecond, even if we allow that a particular delusory judgment is based\nupon sensory experience, should we allow that it involves sensory\nexperience of anything other than elements that are present in the\ndeluded subject\u2019s environment? Perhaps some cases of delusion\ninvolve dysfunctional judgmental responses to what is seen or heard.\nFor example, an alcoholic subject judgment that a pink rat is visible\nmight be a disordered response to an experience of a shadow. Unless we\nare forced to answer both questions affirmatively, we lack the basis\nfor an argument that the deluded subject experiences anything distinct\nfrom the ordinary things and features that they can see, hear,\netc.\n\nAustin doesn\u2019t suggest that there could be no grounds for giving\naffirmative answers to either of those questions. Moreover, it is very\nplausible that such grounds can be provided. It is plausible,\nfor example, that there are distinctive sensory experiences involved\nin what we call seeing double, or seeing afterimages, that cannot be\nexplained simply by appeal to what is present in subjects\u2019\nenvironments. And it is plausible that genuine sensory hallucinations\nare possible\u2014indeed, it is plausible that such hallucinations\nmight figure in explaining the alcoholic person\u2019s judgment.\nHowever, although the style of response just considered is indecisive\nagainst such additional developments of the argument, the resources\nthat it deploys will surely figure in serious engagement with those\ndevelopments. Austin sketches an approach to issues raised by such\nexperiences by attempting to give an account of the reports we are\ninclined to make in such cases\u2014\u201cI see two pieces of\npaper\u201d, \u201cI see pink rats\u201d. Austin\u2019s sketch\naims to explain how such reports can be non-committal about the nature\nof the experiences so-reported, and in particular about whether such\nexperiences have objects at all (1962a: 84\u2013103). It is here in\nparticular that Austin comes close to endorsing a form of\ndisjunctivism about perception (see Soteriou 2009).\n\n(For critical engagement with Austin\u2019s work on perception, see\nAyer 1967, 1969; Burnyeat 1979; Firth 1964; Forguson 1969b; Garvey\n2014; Hinton 1973: 114ff; Hirst 1963; Jackson 1977; Travis and\nKalderon 2013; Leite 2011; Longworth 2019, Marion 2000a,b; Martin ms (Other Internet\nResources), 2000, 2010; Pears 1979; Putnam 1994; Schwartz 2004, 2018;\nSnowdon 2014; Soames 2003: 171\u2013193; Thau 2004; Travis 2004; van\nHulst and Cresswell 2016; Warnock 1989: 11\u201331.)\n4. Action and Freedom\n\nThe core of Austin\u2019s work on freedom and action is contained in\n\u201cA Plea for Excuses\u201d (1957) and developed in \u201cIfs\nand Cans\u201d (1956a), \u201cThree Ways of Spilling Ink\u201d\n(1966), and \u201cPretending\u201d (1958a). The three most\ndistinctive features of his views in this area are the following.\n\n(1)\nAustin\nproposes that philosophers should attend to the details of the ways in\nwhich we talk about particular actions of specific types rather than\nattempting a more direct assault on general questions about freedom\nand action (1957: 175\u2013181; 1966: 273).\n(2)\n\nAustin holds that in order for someone to count as responsible for an\naction, nothing more need be true than that the action is a normal or\nstandard instance of something they do. For example, it need not be\ntrue of the actor, in addition, that they did what they did\nvoluntarily or on purpose (1957: 189\u2013204;\n1966).\n(3)\n\nAustin is inclined to think that, insofar as he understands the thesis\nof determinism, it is incompatible with what we ordinarily\ntake to be true of human action (1956a: 218 fn.1, 231).\n\n4.1 Actions and Excuses\n\nLet\u2019s begin with\n (1).\n Austin holds that we can make progress on questions about freedom and\naction by descending from reflection at the general level\u2014i.e.,\nreflection on freedom and action, per se\u2014to reflection\non the more specific ways in which we characterize and appraise\nactions. Austin\u2019s view about the general notions of acting, and\nof acting freely or responsibly, is structurally similar to his view\nabout the general notion of truth: he thinks of such general notions\nas dimension words, grouping a range of more specific\ncharacterizations. The basic range here consists in the various\nspecific ways in which we can characterize happenings as\nactions\u2014for example, as someone running to the shop, or as their\nreading a book. In addition to that basic range are what Austin calls\naggravations: the various specific ways in which we\ncharacterize someone as distinctively responsible for\nsomething that happens\u2014for example, when we characterize someone\nas having done something on purpose, intentionally, or deliberately.\nThe latter three aggravations are the topic of his \u201cThree Ways\nof Spilling Ink\u201d (1966).\n\nIn his \u201cA Plea for Excuses\u201d (1957), Austin argues that the\nminimal requirement for an agent to be responsible for an action of\ntheirs is that it be incorrect to characterize the action in\none or another way as something for which they were not fully\nresponsible\u2014as something for which they have an excuse.\nWe might, for example, characterize a happening as an accident, a\nmistake, involuntary, unintentional, inadvertent, or as due (in part)\nto clumsiness, lack of appreciation of circumstances, or incompetence.\nWhere an act is performed, and where no excuse is available, the\naction is one for which the actor counts as fully responsible. Where\none or another type of excuse is available, the specific type\nof excuses that are available mitigate in one or another specific way\nthe subject\u2019s responsibility for the occurrence of an action or\nits consequences, and so the extent to which the action is to be\ncounted as free. An excuse may do this by mitigating in various ways\nthe subject\u2019s responsibility either for an action considered as\na whole, or for proper sub-components of the action, or for\nconsequences of the action, or by indicating ways in which a happening\nis not (a paradigmatic case of) an action. The varieties of\npretending that Austin discusses in his\n\u201cPretending\u201d (1958a) are of importance to him, at least in\npart, because they provide for some distinctive forms of excuse. For\ninstance, one might seek to excuse what appeared to be an action of\ntype A by claiming that the agent was only pretending to\nA, pretending to be A-ing, or pretending that they\nwere A-ing. (One of Austin\u2019s aims in the paper is to\ndistinguish those ways of pretending.)\n\nOne of Austin\u2019s central aims in considering the variety of\nexcuses and aggravations is to shed light on the inner composition of\nresponsible action: the division between an action and its\nconsequences; the decomposition of an action into its various\nsub-components or phases; and what Austin calls the machinery of\naction:\n\n\n\u2026the detail of the complicated internal machinery we use in\n\u201cacting\u201d\u2014the receipt of intelligence, the\nappreciation of the situation, the invocation of principles, the\nplanning, the control of execution and the rest. (1957: 179)\n\n\nTurning now to\n (2),\n Austin thinks that there is a range of normal or standard cases of\nattributions of action with respect to which modification, by appeal\neither to aggravations or excuses, is impermissible. With respect to\nsuch normal or standard cases, it suffices, in order to characterize\nthe agent\u2019s role within them, simply to say what the agent did.\nTo add that the agent did the thing, for example, either voluntarily\nor involuntarily would be inappropriate, incorrect, or even\nsenseless. Austin summarizes this idea in the slogan, \u201cNo\nmodification without aberration\u201d. Amongst the supporting\nexamples he gives are the following:\n\n\nI sit in my chair, in the usual way\u2014I am not in a daze or\ninfluenced by threats or the like: here, it will not do to say either\nthat I sit in it intentionally or that I did not sit in it\nintentionally, nor yet that I sat in it automatically or from habit or\nwhat you will. It is bedtime, I am alone, I yawn: but I do not yawn\ninvoluntarily (or voluntarily!), nor yet deliberately. To yawn in any\nsuch peculiar way is just not to just yawn. (1957:\n 190)[23]\n\n\nAustin holds that modifiers like \u201cvoluntarily\u201d and\n\u201cinvoluntarily\u201d are used to assert the respective presence\nand absence of specific elements in the general machinery of action.\n(He suggests that such apparent pairs do not invariably target the\nvery same specific elements. See 1957: 189\u2013193.) Austin thinks\nthat philosophers have tended to assume that, given that someone has\ndone a specific thing, it will always be a further question whether\nthose pieces of machinery are present or absent. Moreover,\nphilosophers have aligned that question with the question whether the\nactor was responsible for what they did or acted freely. Those\nphilosophers have in effect been making the following pair of\nassumptions. They\u2019ve assumed, first, that there is a single type\nof piece of machinery such that for any action, the action\nwill be free and responsible just in case it involves that machinery.\nSecond, they\u2019ve assumed that the various aggravations serve\nindiscriminately to mark the presence of the required type of\nmachinery, while the various excuses serve to mark its absence.\n\nCharacteristically, Austin suggests that the situation is more\ncomplicated. In particular, although he thinks that, in normal or\nstandard cases, actors are responsible for what they do and act\nfreely, he holds that what makes that so can vary from case to case:\ndifferent types of machinery can account for freedom and\nresponsibility with respect to different types of action. He holds\nmoreover that different aggravating and excusing modifiers target\ndifferent pieces of machinery. And, finally, he holds that the\nappropriate use of a modifier doesn\u2019t depend only upon the\npresence or absence of instances of the type of action-machinery that\nit targets. In addition, it depends upon whether the targeted\nmachinery figures in normal cases of actions of the type in\n question.[24]\n\n(For discussion of Austin\u2019s views about actions and excuses see\nForguson 1969a; Heintz 1981; Holdcroft 1969; Laugier 2018; Narboux 2011; New 1966;\nPetrie 1971; Searle 1966; Zimmerman 2004; Warnock 1989: 65\u201379;\nWhite 1967.)\n4.2 Freedom and Ability\n\nLet\u2019s turn now to Austin\u2019s discussion of whether\ndeterminism is compatible with free action\n ((3) above).\n One general form of excuse for doing something would be that one\ncouldn\u2019t avoid doing it. Similarly, a general excuse\nfor failing to do something\u2014failing to apply one\u2019s brakes,\nfor example\u2014would be that one couldn\u2019t do it.\nExcuses of that general type have figured centrally in discussions of\nhuman freedom and the bearing of determinism on whether we ever act\nfreely. Suppose that, wherever an excuse of this form is correctly\napplicable, we are not responsible for the action targeted by the\nexcuse and did not act freely. If this supposition were correct, a\ndemonstration that there are no things that we do that we could have\navoided doing, and no things that we do not do that we could have\ndone, would amount to a demonstration that we are never responsible\nfor doing, or refraining from doing, what we do and, so, never act\nfreely. And some philosophers have held that determinism provides the\nbasis for such a demonstration.\n\nSuch a demonstration might take the following form. The all-in claim\nthat someone could have done something at t requires that the\ncircumstances at t are consistent with their doing that thing\nat t. But according to determinism, the circumstances,\nC, at t determine that one set of events,\nE, occurs at t rather than any others. That is,\naccording to the thesis of determinism, it couldn\u2019t be that\n(C & not-E). Now, given that what the individual\nin question in fact did at t (/refrained from doing at\nt) is a member of E, it couldn\u2019t have been\nthat C and yet they failed to do it (/failed to refrain from\ndoing it). Hence, because of C, it\u2019s not the case that\nthey could have avoided doing what they did (/refraining from doing\nit).\n\nAustin considers this issue in his \u201cIfs and Cans\u201d (1956a).\nThere, he discusses and rejects attempts in G.E. Moore 1912 and\nNowell-Smith 1954 to provide accounts of what we can do on which it\nbeing true that we can do things (/refrain from doing them) is\ncompatible with its being determined by our circumstances that we\ndon\u2019t in fact do them (/refrain from doing them). Austin thinks\nthat his objections to the accounts on which he focuses provide\npartial support to the view that our ordinary claims about what we can\ndo are incompatible with determinism.\n\nThe first proposal of Moore\u2019s that Austin considers is that the\nclaim that someone, S, can do something, A, is\nequivalent to the following claim: S will A, if\nS chooses to A. Austin argues that Moore\u2019s\nfirst proposal is based on a mistaken view about the functioning of\nthe claims of the form: \u201cS can A, if\nS\n chooses\u201d.[25]\n The second proposal of Moore\u2019s that Austin considers is the\nclaim that \u201cS can A\u201d is equivalent to a\nclaim of the form \u201cIf it were that C, then S\nwould B\u201d. For example, \u201cI could have holed the\nputt\u201d might be taken to be equivalent to \u201cIf I had tried\nto hole the putt, I would have succeeded in holing the putt.\u201d\nHere again, it seems that the proposal might be of service in\nsidestepping the challenge posed by determinism. Suppose that in\nactual circumstances C, I don\u2019t try to hole the putt.\nAccording to determinism, it follows that it is impossible that\n(C and I do try to hole the putt). But that is consistent\nboth with its being possible, in slightly different circumstances,\nthat I try to hole the putt, and with it being the case that, if I\nwere to try, I would succeed. Austin doesn\u2019t pursue the proposal\nin detail, though his discussion of Nowell-Smith pursues connected\nissues (219\u2013230). However, in a footnote, Austin presents an\nimportant putative counterexample:\n\n\nConsider the case where I miss a very short putt and kick myself\nbecause I could have holed it. It is not that I should have holed it\nif I had tried: I did try, and missed. It is not that I should have\nholed it if conditions had been different: that might of course be so,\nbut I am talking about conditions as they precisely were, and\nasserting that I could have holed it. There is the rub. (1956a: 218\nfn.1)\n\n\nAustin\u2019s thought here is that attributions of this sort manifest\nour belief that,\n\n\n\u2026a human ability or power or capacity is inherently liable not\nto produce success, on occasion, and that for no reason (or are bad\nluck and bad form sometimes reasons?). (218: 218 fn.1)\n\n\nNow a committed determinist would claim that the events that\nconstitute such failures must be determined\u2014and in that sense\nexplained\u2014by the circumstances at and before the failure. But\nAustin believes\u2014for reasons in effect considered\nabove\u2014that the existence of such an explanation would make it\nthe case that, in fact, the golfer could not have made the\nputt in the circumstances as they precisely were.\n\nWe have here, then, a point at which Austin expresses his view that\nordinary attributions of ability, power, and capacity are incompatible\nwith the thesis of determinism. In response, the compatibilist is\nforced, I think, to deny that its being true that a golfer could have\nholed the putt, or even that he could have holed the putt in precisely\nthe same conditions, entails that he would have holed the putt in a\nperfect duplicate of the actual world. Leaving that issue to\none side, Austin presents the proposed analysis with a case of\nmasking\u2014a case in which, although ability is retained,\nsuccessful exercise of the ability is somehow precluded, for instance\nby outside interference (for discussion of masking, see A. Bird 1998;\nClarke 2009; Fara 2008; and Johnston 1992). The challenge facing the\ndefender of the analysis is to spell out the analysis so as to cope\nwith masking. Arguably, meeting the challenge depends upon provision\nof a non-circular specification of all possible masks. Austin would, I\nthink, claim that it is impossible to meet the challenge. For on his\nview, abilities are sometimes masked brutely, without any\nspecifiable mask. Even if he is wrong about that, it remains an open\nquestion whether the challenge can be met, or whether the endless\nheterogeneity of potential masks makes it impossible to provide an\nexplanatory specification.\n\n(For discussion of Austin views about freedom and ability see Ayers\n1966; Clarke 2009; Kaufman 1963; Locke 1962; New 1966; Nowell-Smith\n1960; Pears 1973; Thalberg 1969; Warnock 1989: 80\u201397.)\n",
