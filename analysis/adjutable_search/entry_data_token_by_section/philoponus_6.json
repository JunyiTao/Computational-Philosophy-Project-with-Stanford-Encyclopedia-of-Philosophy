    "main_text": "The Critical Treatises || On the Eternity of the World Against Proclus\n3.1 On the Eternity of the World Against Proclus\n\n\nThe Athenian Neoplatonist Proclus (ca. 411\u2013485), the teacher of\nPhiloponus\u2019 own teacher Ammonius, had written a defense of the widespread conviction among\nGreek philosophers that the\nworld is eternal. His aim was to demonstrate the untenability of Christian creationism.  Proclus\u2019 eighteen arguments took their\npoint of departure from the myth of Plato\u2019s Timaeus, which,\naccording to Proclus, was best and most consistently interpreted\naccording to an eternalist reading: the surface talk of a world being\nconstructed by a divine \u2018demiurge\u2019 is part of the mythical and didactic framework, not an actual philosophical claim.\n\n In 529, the year when emperor Justinian put an end to pagan\nphilosophical teaching in Athens, Philoponus published a detailed reply\nentitled On the Eternity of the World against Proclus. The\nbook amounts to an anti-commentary on the Proclean arguments: combing\nthrough Proclus\u2019 text, Philoponus literally repudiates every single\npoint made. Although his efforts are evidently to some extent\nmotivated by his Christian faith, he keeps biblical theology out of\nhis polemic, attempting to refute Proclus within the framework of\nPlatonist philosophy. He reads the Timaeus as a genuine\naccount of creation (Book VI), compatible with Christian doctrine. A\nnew and ingenious analysis of the processes of generation and corruption renders\neven an idea viable which Greek philosophers of all schools roundly rejected: creation out of nothing (Books VIII and IX). And even if it\nis true, Philoponus retorts, that creation out of nothing never occurs in nature, God is\nsurely more powerful a creator than nature and therefore quite possibly capable of\ncreatio ex nihilo (IX 9).\n",
