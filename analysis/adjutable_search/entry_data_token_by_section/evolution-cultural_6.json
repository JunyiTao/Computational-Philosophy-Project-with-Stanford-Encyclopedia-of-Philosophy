Whether an individual\ncan acquire some belief thus depends on conceptual competencies. It is\nimpossible to believe in the theory of relativity without\nunderstanding it, and one cannot understand it without holding many\nadditional beliefs relating to physics. The same is true for\nnon-technical beliefs. Depending on which religion one is talking\nabout, belief in God is likely to be related to various other beliefs\nconcerning forgiveness, retribution, love and so forth.\n\nThere are two problems here. The first is whether, and to what extent,\nculture can be decomposed into traits at all, and if so, how.\nCao (2020) argues that cultural traits should mostly be individuated\nrelative to the interests and capacities of the agents learning and\npassing them along. Though this does provide a route towards\nindividuating and distinguishing cultural traits, it should be cold\ncomfort to memeticists. Recall that for memeticists, memes are\nindividuated independently of the interest of agents, who are supposed\nto be mere hosts or scaffolds for the reproduction of further\nmemes.\n\nThe second problem concerns the extent to which replication\noperates over discrete traits, however individuated. The\nanthropologist Adam Kuper, for instance, complains that\n\n\nUnlike genes, cultural traits are not particulate. An idea about God\ncannot be separated from other ideas with which it is indissolubly\nlinked in a particular religion. (Kuper 2000: 180)\n\n\nMemeticists are likely to respond by saying that although ideas are\ninterlinked, this does not undermine the meme-gene analogy.\nO\u2019Brien et al. (2010), for instance, have argued that a more\nmature view of the role of genes in evolution and development\nreinstates the meme-gene parallel. Genes, too, need to be studied in a\ncontext that takes other genes, and their broader developmental and\nenvironmental settings, into account. A DNA sequence can have\ndifferent effects in different organisms, depending on the network of\nrelations it enters into with other genetic and developmental\nresources. Just as the significance of belief in God can vary with\nsocial context, with the result that it can make little sense to think\nof \u201cbelief in God\u201d in general as a single type of meme, so\nthe function of some DNA sequence can vary with organic context, with\nthe result that it makes little sense to identify some sequence type\nas a gene for the purposes of evolutionary analysis.\n\n",
