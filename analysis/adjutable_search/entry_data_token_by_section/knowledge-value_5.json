    "main_text": "Other Accounts of the Value of Knowledge\n6. Other Accounts of the Value of Knowledge\n\nJohn Hawthorne (2004; cf. Stanley 2005; Fantl & McGrath 2002) has\nargued that knowledge is valuable because of the role it plays in\npractical reasoning. More specifically, Hawthorne (2004: 30) argues\nfor the principle that one should use a proposition p as a\npremise in one\u2019s practical reasoning only if one knows\np. Hawthorne primarily motivates this line of argument by\nappeal to the lottery case. This concerns an agent\u2019s true belief\nthat she holds the losing ticket for a fair lottery with long odds and\na large cash prize, a belief that is based solely on the fact that she\nhas reflected on the odds involved. Intuitively, we would say that\nsuch an agent lacks knowledge of what she believes, even though her\nbelief is true and even though her justification for what she\nbelieves\u2014assessed in terms of the likelihood, given this\njustification, of her being right\u2014is unusually strong. Moreover,\nwere this agent to use this belief as a premise in her practical\nreasoning, and so infer that she should throw the ticket away without\nchecking the lottery results in the paper for example, then we would\nregard her reasoning as problematic.\n\nLottery cases therefore seem to show that justified true belief, no\nmatter how strong the degree of justification, is not enough for\nacceptable practical reasoning\u2014instead, knowledge is required.\nMoreover, notice that we can alter the example slightly so that the\nagent does possess knowledge while at the same time having a\nweaker justification for what she believes (where strength of\njustification is again assessed in terms of the likelihood, given this\njustification, that the agent\u2019s belief is true). If the agent\nhad formed her true belief by reading the results in a reliable\nnewspaper, for example, then she would count as knowing the target\nproposition and can then infer that she should throw the ticket away\nwithout criticism. It is more likely, however, that the newspaper has\nprinted the result wrongly than that she should win the lottery. This\nsort of consideration seems to show that knowledge, even when\naccompanied by a relatively weak justification, is better (at least\nwhen it comes to practical reasoning) than a true belief that is\nsupported by a relatively strong justification but does not amount to\nknowledge. If this is the right way to think about the connection\nbetween knowledge possession and practical reasoning, then it seems to\noffer a potential response to at least the secondary value\nproblem.\n\nA second author who thinks that our understanding of the concept of\nknowledge can have important ramifications for the value of knowledge\nis Edward Craig (1990). Craig\u2019s project begins with a thesis\nabout the value of the concept of knowledge. Simplifying somewhat,\nCraig hypothesises that the concept of knowledge is important to us\nbecause it fulfills the valuable function of enabling us to identify\nreliable informants. The idea is that it is clearly of immense\npractical importance to be able to recognize those from whom we can\ngain true beliefs, and that it was in response to this need that the\nconcept of knowledge arose. As with Hawthorne\u2019s theory, this\nproposal, if correct, could potentially offer a resolution of at least\nthe secondary value problem.\n\nRecently, there have been additional attempts to follow\u2014broadly\nspeaking\u2014Craig\u2019s project, for which the value of knowledge\nis understood in terms of the functional role that\n\u2018knowledge\u2019 plays in fulfilling our practical needs. The\nmatter of how to identify this functional role has received increasing\nrecent attention. For example, David Henderson (2009), Robin McKenna\n(2013), Duncan Pritchard (2012) and Michael Hannon (2015) have\ndefended views about the concept of knowledge (or knowledge\nascriptions) that are broadly inspired by Craig\u2019s favored\naccount of the function of knowledge as identifying reliable\ninformants. A notable rival account, defended by Klemens Kappel\n(2010), Christoph Kelp (2011, 2014) and Patrick Rysiew (2012; cf.\nKvanvig 2012) identifies closure of inquiry as the relevant\nfunction. For Krista Lawlor (2013) the relevant function is identified\n(\u00e0 la Austin) as that of providing assurance,\nand for James Beebe (2012), it\u2019s expressing epistemic\napproval/disapproval.\n\nIn one sense, such accounts are in competition with one another, in\nthat they offer different practical explications of\n\u2018knowledge\u2019. However, these accounts all accept\n(explicitly or tacitly) a more general insight, which is that\nconsiderations about the function that the concept of knowledge plays\nin fulfilling practical needs should inform our theories of the nature\nand corresponding value of knowledge. This more general point remains\ncontroversial in contemporary metaepistemology. For some arguments\nagainst supposing that a practical explication of\n\u2018knowledge\u2019, in terms of some need-fulfilling function,\nshould inform our accounts of the nature or knowledge, see for example\nGerken (2015). For a more extreme form of argument in favor of\ndivorcing considerations to do with how and why we use\n\u2018knows\u2019 from epistemological theorizing altogether, see\nHazlett (2010; cf. Turri 2011b).\n\nA further and more recent practically oriented approach to the value\nof knowledge is defended by Grindrod (2019), who considers\nspecifically the ramifications of epistemic\ncontextualism\u00a0for the value of knowledge. Contextualists\nmaintain that knowledge attributing sentences can vary in truth value\nacross different contexts of utterance. This kind of position about\nthe semantics of knowledge attributions is often motivated by\n\u00a0context-shifting cases, such as DeRose\u2019s (1992) bank case,\nwhich seem to suggest that the a knowledge attribution is true\ndepends on the epistemic standards (as fixed by practical stakes)\nof the attributor of the knowledge ascription (see entry on\n Epistemic Contextualism).\n Grindrod maintains that if epistemic contextualism is true, then\nepistemic value(including whatever epistemic value might\nseparate knowledge from mere true belief) should be\ncontextualised.\n",
