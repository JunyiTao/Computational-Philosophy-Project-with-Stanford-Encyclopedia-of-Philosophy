    "main_text": "The Aufbau || Later Discussion of the Aufbau\n3.3 Later Discussion of the Aufbau\n\nWhen the book was published in 1928, it was widely discussed and,\nalong with Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus, became one of the\nclassic texts of the Vienna Circle. Its effect was amplified in the\nEnglish-speaking world by A.J. Ayer\u2019s acknowledgement of Carnap\nas the philosopher to whom he \u201cowe[s] most\u201d in his\nbest-selling Language, Truth, and Logic (Ayer 1936), which\nwas understood as an accessible summary exposition of the supposed\nphenomenalism of the Aufbau, but misrepresented the book\nquite seriously. This misrepresentation contributed to the later\nneglect of the book among Anglo-American philosophers, which even the\nsophisticated discussion, critique, and further development by Nelson\nGoodman (1951) or the belated English translation (1967) could hardly\nbudge. It also allowed many preconceptions about the book to continue\ncirculating almost through the end of the twentieth century.\n\nOnly toward the end of that century did a revaluation set in,\ninitiated by Michael Friedman, who took issue, in a series of papers\n(later collected in Friedman 1999), with the entire English-speaking\ntradition (going back to Ayer) of seeing the Aufbau as a\nphenomenalist project of reducing all knowledge to sense impressions\non the model of Hume or Mach. Instead, Friedman pointed out, we should\nsee it in the context of its neo-Kantian origins. From that\nperspective, the Aufbau is better understood as seeking a new\nbasis of scientific objectivity\u2014achieving objective knowledge\ndespite the subjective starting point of individual perception, and\nthe structuralism discussed above\n (section 3.2).\n On the basis of Friedman\u2019s discussions, many others have since\ncontributed to the revaluation of the Aufbau (Richardson\n1998; Mormann 2000; Pincock 2005, 2009; the papers collected in\nDamb\u00f6ck 2016.)\n\nThis new interpretive interest in the Aufbau and its\nphilosophical context has also led to renewed efforts to reconstruct\nthe Aufbau\u2019s constitution system with new tools.\nGoodman\u2019s 1951 critique of quasianalysis has finally found\nresponses and repairs from Mormann (1994, 1997, 2009) and Leitgeb\n(2007); Leitgeb (2011) goes further and argues that if the goals of\nthe Aufbau strategy are limited in certain ways,\nGoodman\u2019s and Quine\u2019s critiques no longer apply (see the\nsupplement\n Aufbau (Sections 3 and 4)).\n Chalmers (2012) suggests a much more drastic rationalistic\nrevision of the Aufbau; where Carnap thought it would be\npossible, in principle, to derive all true scientific sentences\nwhatsoever from basic true sentences in an \u201cempiricistically\nacceptable\u201d constitution system just by means of the\nsystem\u2019s definitions, Chalmers drops any empiricist ambitions\nand replaces the role of definitions by that of a priori\nknowledge, including synthetic a priori knowledge (whose\nexistence Carnap of course denied).\n",
