    "main_text": "(Neo)-Russellian Challenges || The Locality Challenge\n2.4 The Locality Challenge\n\nAccording to many conceptions of causation, causes are local in\nvarious senses: First, causes are synchronically local: they are\n\u201csmallish,\u201d spatially localized events\u2014or at least\ntheir size is proportionate to the size of the effect under\nconsideration. If we demand locality in this sense, then this puts\ninto sharper focus one of the horns of the trilemma posed by the\ndominant cause: we cannot identify the state on an entire\ntime-slice S as the cause of an event in the future of S\non pains of violating the locality constraint that causes be\nspatio-temporally localized.\n\nCausal relations are also often assumed to satisfy diachronic locality\nconstraints. Broadly such constraints come in two types: according to\nthe first type of constraint causes do not act where they are not.\nThat is, causes do not act across spatial or temporal gaps. According\nto the second type of constraint causal influences do not propagate\ninfinitely fast. The two types of constraint are logically\nindependent. Newtonian gravitational theory violates both types of\nconstraint, but rigid body mechanics violates only the finite-speed\nconstraint while action-at-a-distance versions of classical\nelectrodynamics (that posit particles but not fields) satisfy the\nfinite speed constraint but posit propagation of electromagnetic\ninfluences across spatio-temporal gaps. Classical electrodynamics as\nclassical particle-field theory is the paradigm of a local theory:\ninteractions among charged particles propagate at a finite\nspeed\u2014the speed of light\u2014and are mediated by the\nelectromagnetic field (Frisch 2002).\n\nLocality constraints come under pressure in quantum mechanics (see\n section 7\n below). One can use this fact as a premise in an anti-causal argument\nparalleling the argument appealing to failures of determinism.\n\nIf causal notions play a legitimate role in physics, they must do\nso as part of an acceptable \u201cprinciple of causality\u201d.\nA locality condition is part of any plausible candidate for such a\nprinciple.\nTo be acceptable any such principle must provide a universal\nconstraint on all physical theories.\nThere exist successful physical theories that violate the locality\ncondition.\nTherefore, causal notions do not play a legitimate role in\nphysics.\n\n\nIn analogy to the case of the determinism challenge, one can resist\nthe conclusion of the argument by denying premise 1 and maintain that\ncausal constraints can play a legitimate and useful role in physical\ntheorizing even if they are not part of a universal principle of\ncausality. Thus, one could maintain that the relativistic constraint\nthat influences do not propagate faster than the speed of light is a\ngenuinely causal constraint, which functions as a desideratum on\nphysical theories but does not lose its legitimacy and importance\nshould it not be satisfied by all successful theories of physics.\n\nAgain, the challenge may be raised within each of the three\nphilosophical projects, with subtle but important different in each\ncase. Within the descriptive project the argument would aim to show\nthat a certain feature of our common-sense notion of cause does not\nallow this notion to at least some theoretical frameworks in\nphysics.\n\nWithin the functional project one could argue in defense of premises 2\nand 3 that local causal relations satisfy certain crucial desiderata\nnot satisfied by non-local, putatively causal relations. Some\nwell-known remarks by Albert Einstein concerning the role of locality\nsuggest one route such an argument could take. According to Einstein,\nin a world that is not synchronically and diachronically local\n\u201cphysical thought\u201d and \u201cthe establishment of\nempirically testable laws in the sense familiar to us\u201d would be\nimpossible (1948: 322; quoted in Howard 1985:\n187\u20138). Einstein\u2019s remarks suggest an argument according\nto which only causal relations satisfying various locality principles\ncan fulfil cognitively useful functions such as allowing for testable\npredictions and guiding interventions. Yet this line of argument comes\nunder pressure to the extent that quantum systems violate certain\nlocality principles yet allow for testable predictions and\nexperimental interventions (see\n section 7).\n",
