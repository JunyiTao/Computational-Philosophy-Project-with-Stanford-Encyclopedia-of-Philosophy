    "main_text": "Detecting Drift Empirically || Studies of Drift and Molecular Evolution\n4.2 Studies of Drift and Molecular Evolution\n\nAs Dietrich (1994) has documented, early work in molecular evolution\nwas focused almost exclusively on selection, something that changed\nwith the advent of the neutral theory of molecular evolution and the\nwork of Motoo Kimura, Jack King, and Thomas Jukes. Dietrich\nwrites:\n\n\nThe basis of its challenge was Kimura\u2019s proposal that most\nchanges detected at the molecular level were not acted upon by natural\nselection; they were neutral, and the mechanism of their change was\nrandom genetic drift. (1994: 22)\n\n\nTo be clear, however, both selection and drift play an essential role\nin the neutral theory; on Kimura\u2019s view, selection will quickly\neliminate the large number of deleterious mutants and fix the small\nnumber of advantageous ones, leaving the remaining mutant alleles as\nneutral, whereupon they undergo a process of drift (Dietrich 2006).\nDrift would eventually cause the neutral (and nearly neutral) mutants\nto either go to fixation or be lost (although they would be\npolymorphic in the meantime), so that observed molecular differences\nwould be\n\n\nthe outcomes of a random process of mutation, which Kimura understood\nas produced largely from DNA replication error, processes of\ndirectional selection, and processes of random drift produced by\ngamete sampling. (Dietrich 2006: 670)\n\n\nMany of the debates about the neutral theory contrasted this approach\n(the \u201cneutralist\u201d approach) to evolution with a more\nselectionist (or sometimes, \u201cpanselectionist\u201d) approach,\ncausing many to refer to a \u201cneutralist-selectionist\ncontroversy\u201d.\n\nThe advocates of the neutral theory initially proposed it as an\nunrealistic simple model only to have subsequent data on the\nprevalence of neutral alleles convince them of its realism. That led\nto more explicit testing of the neutral theory and debates over the\nmolecular clock (Dietrich 2006). To focus on the first of these,\nDietrich (2006) suggests that although the neutral theory promised to\ngenerate numerous quantitative testable predictions\u2014and\ndid\u2014testing it has in fact proved difficult. Is this because of\nthe difficulty in identifying outcomes that are unique to drift?\nPerhaps so. For example, the neutral theory predicted a certain\nmeasure of heterozygosity, but when Francisco Ayala and colleagues\nfailed to observe that predicted outcome in a study of natural\npopulations of Drosophila, Jack King responded by saying that\nmany of the assumptions made by the model could be the source of the\ndiscrepancy. In other words, as has been well-discussed in the\nphilosophy of science, there are no \u201ccrucial experiments\u201d\nbetween two theories because theories are always tested together with\ntheir assumptions, any one of which can be given up rather than\nrejecting the theory. Debates over the so-called \u201cmolecular\nclock\u201d can also be understood in terms of the search for\ndistinctive outcomes for drift. At first, it was thought that only\ndrift could make sense of an apparent constant rate of\nevolution\u2014that only drift would produce such an\noutcome\u2014yet this time it is the selectionists who modified their\nassumptions such that their models would also predict a molecular\nclock outcome (Dietrich and Skipper 2007).\n\nSubsequently, Tomoko Ohta began to argue for a more significant role\nfor weakly selected mutants (Ohta 1973). Essentially, Ohta\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201cnearly neutral\u201d includes mutants that are\nless neutral than Kimura\u2019s \u201cnearly neutral\u201d mutants,\nand larger amounts of them as well (Dietrich and Millstein 2008).\nLater refinements included both slightly deleterious and slightly\nadvantageous mutants. This changes the processes that one would expect\nto be acting. With the (strictly) neutral theory, only drift would act\non the neutral mutants. With the nearly neutral theory, the nearly\nneutral mutations (whether advantageous or deleterious) would subject\nto very weak selection (discriminate sampling) and to drift\nin the form of indiscriminate gamete sampling (Dietrich and Millstein\n2008). Because the selection is weak, it would be swamped by the\neffects of drift, but both processes would still be occurring. Ohta\nbelieved that the nearly neutral theory could better account for the\nresults found by Ayala and his colleagues (with its large number of\nrelatively rare alleles), and also, that it could better explain some\nfeatures of the molecular clock (Dietrich and Millstein 2008).\nHowever, it has proven much more difficult to find unique outcomes for\nthe nearly neutral theory than the neutral theory. This makes the\nnearly neutral theory more difficult to test for and less useful as a\nnull hypothesis as compared to the neutral theory, even as it might\naccount for the available data better.\n",
