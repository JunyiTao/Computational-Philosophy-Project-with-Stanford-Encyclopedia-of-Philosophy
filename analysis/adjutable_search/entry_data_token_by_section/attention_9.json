    "main_text": "Theories of Attention || Competition Theories and Cognitive Unison\n2.6 Competition Theories and Cognitive Unison\n\nLike the precision-optimization theories that have been advocated by\nHohwy and Clark, from within the framework of the prediction-error\ncoding theory, the Coherence theories advocated by Neisser, Neumann,\nAllport, and Wu have also suggested functions for attention other than\nthe management of limitations in processing capacity. Despite the\navailability of these non-Broadbentian conceptions of\nattention\u2019s function, the Broadbentian idea that\nattention\u2019s selectivity serves to manage limitations in\nprocessing capacity continues to be regarded by many psychologists as\nincontrovertible. The claim that \u201cBecause the visual system does\nnot have the capacity to process all inputs simultaneously, there must\nexist attentional processes that help the visual system select some\ninputs\u201d continues to be treated as a platitude of the sort that\ncan be used as an uncontroversial opening sentence when introducing\none\u2019s research. (The example just given comes from the beginning\nof Vecera (2000), but many more examples of the same claim can easily\nbe found.)\n\nFor those who reject this platitude, and think that the\nfunction of attention is something other than the management\nof limitations in processing capacity, it is natural to think that the\nmechanisms of attentional selection may be something other\nthan capacity bottlenecks.\n\nThe clearest non-bottleneck mechanisms for achieving selectivity are\ncompetitions. Since well-organized competitions can always\nselect one winner, however good and however numerous the competitors,\nthe selectivity of a competitive mechanism need not have anything to\ndo with bottlenecks, or with any other limitations of processing\ncapacity.\n\nCompetition-based mechanisms for achieving selectivity come in at\nleast two varieties: In a simple race mechanism each of the\ncompetitors independently completes a process that is comparable,\nalong some dimension of variation, with the processes that are\ncompleted by each of the other competitors. The competitor that\nachieves the highest value on the relevant dimension of variation is\nselected as the winner. In a struggle the competitors do not\njust get on with their own processing in the hope that they will do it\nbetter than each of the other competitors. Instead the active\nsuppression of other competitors is a part of the process that each\ncompetitor carries out. Simple race models of attention have been\nproposed (Shibuya and Bundesen, 1988, Bundesen, 1987), but our best\ncurrent theories supplement the simple race mechanism with some\ncomponents of mutual struggle, or with additional processes of\ntop-down control (see, for example, Bundesen and Habekost, 2008).\n\nOne suggestion for a supplemented-competition mechanism for\nattentional selectivity is the biased-competition model, elaborated in\nseveral works by Robert Desimone, John Duncan and John Reynolds. The\nbiased-competition model accounts for various attention-involving\neffects, at the personal and at the sub-personal level, as being\neffects that arise from numerous struggles between the different\nstimuli that fall within the variously sized receptive fields of\nneurons throughout the perceptual processing hierarchy. It is\nhypothesized that each one of these struggles is biased, although not\nsettled outright, by a top-down attention-specific signal (Desimone\nand Duncan, 1995, Reynolds and Desimone, 2001).\n\nWe have said that competitions are selective in ways that do not\ninvolve limitations in capacity, and that competition-based theories\nof attention\u2019s underlying mechanisms are therefore natural\naccompaniments to selection-for-action type views of attention\u2019s\nfunction (Section\n 2.3),\n and perhaps to other views that involve a break from the Broadbentian\nview according to which attention\u2019s function is the management of\ncapacity limitations. Competition views of attention\u2019s\nmechanisms do not, however, require us to take a non-Broadbentian view\nof attention\u2019s function. Although the biased competition view\nsits naturally with a non-Broadbentian view of that function, Reynolds\nand Desimone continue to introduce the biased competition theory as an\nattempt to understand attention in recognizably Broadbentian terms,\nwriting that:\n\nThe visual system is limited in its capacity to process information.\nHowever, it is equipped to overcome this constraint because it can\ndirect this limited capacity channel to locations or objects of\ninterest. (2001, 233)\n\n\nSome advocates of the biased competition view emphasize the particular\nimportance of the top-down biasing signals that the theory postulates\n(e.g., Beck and Kastner, 2009, p. 1156), taking the source of\nthese signals to be the true locus of attentional selection. Others\nsuggest that the biased competition theory is better understood as a\ntheory that refuses to identify any such locus, and that it should\ninstead be read (as suggested in Duncan\u2019s original presentation\nof the theory, (Duncan 1996)) as attributing the selectivity of\nattention to the totality of an integrated competition, involving\nprocesses of various sorts at various levels, any part of which can\nbias any other (Mole, 2011, \u00a76.7, 2015).\n\nWhen it is understood in this second way the biased-competition theory\naccords with the proposal that attention should be taken to have a\nmetaphysical status analogous to that of unison in an orchestra.\nAccording to this view it is always a mistake to identify any one\nprocess as the attention process (or any set of processes as the\nattention processes); attention requires the unified activity of\nwhichever processes happen to be relevant to a person\u2019s current\ntask, but, since these vary from one task to the next, it does not\nrequire any particular processes to be taking place. Such a\nview has been developed in work by Christopher Mole, who dubs it the\n\u2018Cognitive Unison Theory\u2019. Metaphysically speaking, such a\ntheory can be understood as a revival of John Locke and F.H.\nBradley\u2019s view that attention is a mode of thinking (see\n Section 1.3\n above). Phenomenologically the view has a precedent in Ribot\u2019s\nsuggestion that attention be identified with \u2018monoideism\u2019\n(Ribot, 1889, p. 10). It also draws on some ideas about the\n\u2018polymorphousness\u2019 of attention, which were advocated in a\n1964 monograph by Alan White, on the basis of considerations drawn\nfrom the examination of various \u2018heed concepts\u2019 in natural\nlanguage.\n\nBecause operating in unison requires an absence of task-irrelevant\nprocessing, the most straightforward version of the unison theory\nentails that full attention is a rare achievement, with most cases of\nattentiveness involving what is, strictly speaking, only partial or\ndivided attention. Mole (like Ribot) accepts this implication. Yair\nLevy has suggested that doing so prevents him from giving an adequate\naccount of phenomena such a listening, or observing, which always\nrequire some attention to be paid, but which can nonetheless be done\nmore or less attentively (Levy, 2019). Work by Philipp Koralus has\nsuggested that a more satisfactory treatment of divided attention can\nbe given if the attentive pursuit of a task is understood to share\ncertain formal properties with the answering of a question (Koralus,\n2014). This characterization of attention as \u201cthe means by which\nwe answer questions about the environment\u201d has been argued for\non phenomenological and epistemological grounds by Naomi Eilan (Eilan,\n1998). (Eilan credits the thought to Rowland Stout, whose treatment of\nit can be found in Chapter 9 \u00a75 of Stout 2006.) Koralus draws on\nHamblin\u2019s 1958 semantics of questions to provide a formal model\nof such questioning (Hamblin, 1958).\n\nThere are philosophical issues, independent of the cognitive unison\ntheory, about the way in which partial or divided attention relates to\nfull attention, and about whether a distinction should be drawn\nbetween the attention that is given to things by which we are merely\ndistracted and the attention that is given to things on which we\nremain concertedly focused. Aaron Henry considers these questions as\npart of a more general enquiry into attention and control, using the\nnotion of constitutive norms to provide an account in which\ndistraction always does involve a certain sort of shortcoming, while\nnonetheless qualifying as a case of genuine attention, rather than\nmerely being a defective approximation of it (Henry, 2019). Zachary\nIrving has suggested that the wandering of a distracted mind presents\nphilosophical puzzles of its own, and has worked towards giving an\nempirically-informed account of mind-wandering that avoids these\npuzzles. His account takes such wandering to be attentive but unguided\n(Irving, 2016). Theories such as the Cognitive Unison Theory, in which\nattention essentially depends on the performance of an\nunderstanding-guided task, will need to find some alternative account\nof the phenomena that Irving identifies.\n",
