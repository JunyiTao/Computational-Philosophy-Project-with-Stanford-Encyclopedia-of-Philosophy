    "main_text": "Art as Expression\n2. Art as Expression\n\nIf art proper is not the stimulation of preconceived emotion, and not\nthe representation of it either, then what precisely does it mean to\nsay that, nevertheless, art is the expression of emotion? The key is\nto remember that art is not craft\u2014Collingwood assumes that the\nreader will accept this, once it is pointed out\u2014and hence the\ndistinction between means and ends does not, strictly speaking, apply.\nNor does the distinction between planning and execution. Instead,\nCollingwood writes in a passage that is often quoted, when a person\nexpresses an emotion, he is\n\nconscious of \u2026 a perturbation or excitement which he feels\ngoing on within him, but of whose nature he is ignorant. While in this\nstate, all he can say about his emotion is: \u2018I feel \u2026 I\ndon\u2019t know what I feel.\u2019 From this helpless and oppressed\ncondition he extricates himself by doing something which we call\nexpressing himself. This is an activity which has something to do with\nthe thing we call language: he expresses himself by speaking. It also\nsomething to do with consciousness: the emotion expressed is an\nemotion of whose nature the person who feels it is no longer\nunconscious. It also has something to do with the way in which he\nfeels the emotion. As unexpressed, he feels it in what we called a\nhelpless and oppressed way; as expressed, he feels in a way from which\nthis sense of oppression has vanished. His mind is somehow lightened\nand eased (109\u201310).\n\n\nThe following three points emerge from this. 1. To express is to\nbecome conscious of an emotion: that is why the distinction\nbetween plan and execution cannot be applied. 2. Expression\nindividualises; rather than describing the emotion in words\nwhose signification is in principle general, the expression is a\nintrinsic feature of the utterance, of the \u2018utterance\nitself\u2019 (although he does not credit him, this is an evident\nexample where Collingwood follows Croce). Thus we cannot speak of the\nemotion embodied in a work of art as if it were the content which the\nart provides the form. 3. The \u2018lightening\u2019 of which\nCollingwood speaks is not that of catharsis, which provides an outlet\nfor the emotion and may take place without its agents being conscious\nof it at all. It is the achievement of clarity, of focus of mind,\nwhich may indeed intensify what is felt rather than attenuate it\n(though typically it does not).\n\nThis last point suggests that there is such a thing as an\n\u2018aesthetic emotion\u2019, but it \u2018is not a specific kind\nof emotion pre-existing to the expression of it\u2019 (117). Instead,\nit is an \u2018emotional colouring which attends the expression of\nany emotion whatever\u2019 (ibid.) Expression, in this\nsense, must be sharply distinguished from the betrayal of emotion;\none\u2019s tears may be said to \u2018express\u2019 one\u2019s\nsadness, or stamping one\u2019s feet ones anger, but these can occur\nwithout the making lucid and intelligible of the emotion that is\nrequisite for expression in Collingwood\u2019s sense. Betrayal can\neven occur that is wholly unconscious; one can blush without noticing\nit. The relation between expressive object and emotion is that of\nembodiment or realization, not of inference.\n",
