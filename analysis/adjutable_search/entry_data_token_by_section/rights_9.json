    "main_text": "Rights and Reasons || Rights to Do Wrong\n5.4 Rights to Do Wrong\n\nAre there rights to do wrong? Many have thought so. Waldron (1993, 63)\ngives the example of antiwar protesters organizing a rowdy\ndemonstration near a Remembrance Day service; Wellman (1997, 33)\noffers the illustration of edging into a checkout line with a full\ncart, just ahead of a tired woman carrying triplets. The puzzle is how\nthe positive normative force of \u201ca right\u201d can exist so\nclose to an opposed negative normative pole, \u201cwrong.\u201d In\nHohfeldian terms, how can there be a right (no duty not) to do what it\nis wrong (duty not) to do? (Similar questions arise about \u201cthe\nabuse of rights\u201d (Schauer 1984).)\n\nThere are two main readings of rights to do wrong. The first reading\ncharacterizes most rights as furthering the holder\u2019s autonomy.\nRights entitle their holders to make choices, and as Waldron (1993)\nsays the importance of a person\u2019s having choices would be\ndiminished if she were forced to do the right thing. Even though the\nperson has no (privilege-) right to perform an action that is wrong,\nit would nevertheless violate an important (claim-) right of hers for\nothers to compel her not to do that thing. To take the speech example,\nwe respect the autonomy of speakers when we allow them to speak\nunmolested\u2014even when they do wrong by expressing themselves in\ndisrespectful ways. (For a defense of this reading against objections\nfrom Galston and George, see Herstein 2012. On the existence and value\nof legal rights to do legal wrongs, see Herstein 2013.)\n\nThe second reading of rights to do wrong sees them as involving a\nmid-sentence shift in domains of reasons. There is no mystery, after\nall, in having a legal right to do something morally\nwrong. The potential for a legal right to do a moral wrong arises from\nthe fact that the domains of legal and moral reasons are not perfectly\noverlapped. One has a legal privilege to edge in front of the tired\nmother in the check-out line, but this is something that one has a\nmoral duty not to do. Similarly, one might have a moral privilege to\ndo what one has no customary privilege to do (a moral right to do a\ncustomary wrong), and so on. Each domain of reasons is distinct, and\nhowever conclusive are the reasons that any particular\nrights-assertion implies, these are only reasons within a single\ndomain of reasons (moral, or legal, or customary). Osiel (2019)\nexamines the sociology of stigmatization that encourages individuals\nand states not to exercise their legal rights in ways that violate\nmoral norms.\n\nA related question concerns how it can come to be permissible to treat\nA in certain ways that would, but for the actions or situation of A,\nbe wrong. For example, it is wrong purposefully to impose a hardship\non another person, unless that person has acted in a way that merits\npunishment. Wellman (2017) makes a close study of how it can be\npermissible to punish, concluding that the best explanation is that\nthe wrongdoer has forfeited her right against hard treatment. A\nseparate line of scholarship running through work by Thomson, McMahan,\nOtsuka, Frowe, and Lazar debates how it can be permissible to attack\ninnocents during war (see Walen 2019, 2\u20138).\n",
