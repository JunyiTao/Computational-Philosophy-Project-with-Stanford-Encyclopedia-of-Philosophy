    "main_text": "The Null Support Thesis\n5. The Null Support Thesis\n\nA version of global strong heuristic predictivism is the null support\nthesis that holds that theories never receive confirmation from\nevidence they were built to fit\u2014precisely because of how they\nwere built. This thesis has been attributed to Bacon and Descartes\n(Howson 1990: 225). Popper and Lakatos also subscribe to this thesis,\nthough it is important to remember that they do not recognize any form\nof confirmational support\u2014even from successful predictions. But\nothers who maintained that successful predictions do confirm theories\nnonetheless endorsed the null support hypothesis. Giere provides the\nfollowing argument:\n\n\nIf the known facts were used in constructing the model and were thus\nbuilt into the resulting hypothesis\u2026then the fit between these\nfacts and the hypothesis provides no evidence that the hypothesis is\ntrue [since] these facts had no chance of refuting the hypothesis.\n(1984: 161; Glymour 1980: 114 and Zahar 1983: 245 offer similar\narguments)\n\n\nThe idea is that the way the theory was built provided an illegitimate\nprotection against falsification by the facts\u2014hence the facts\ncannot support the theory. Others however find this argument specious,\nnoting that since the content of the hypothesis is fixed, it makes no\nsense to think of any facts as having a \u2018chance\u2019 to\nfalsify the theory. The theory says what it says, and any particular\nfact refutes it or it doesn\u2019t. \n\n\nGiere has confused what is in effect a random variable (the\nexperimental setup or data source E together with its set of\ndistinct possible outcomes) with one of its values (the outcome\ne)\u2026Moreover, it makes perfectly good sense to say that\nE might well have produced an outcome other than the one,\ne, it did as a matter of fact produce. (Howson 1990: 229; see\nalso Collins 1994: 220) \n\n\nThus Giere\u2019s argument collapses.\n\nHowson argued in a series of papers (1984, 1988, 1990) that the null\nsupport thesis is falsified using simple examples, such as the\nfollowing:\n\n\nAn urn contains an unknown number of black and white tickets, where\nthe proportion p of black tickets is also unknown. The data\nconsists simply in a report of the relative frequency \\(r/k\\) of black\ntickets in a large number k of draws with replacement from the\nurn. In the light of the data we propose the hypothesis that \\(p =\n(r/k)+\\epsilon\\) for some suitable \\(\\epsilon\\) depending on k.\nThis hypothesis is, according to standard statistical lore, very well\nsupported by the data from which it is clearly constructed. (1990:\n231) \n\n\nIn this case there is, Howson notes, a background theory that supplies\na model of the experiment (it is a sequence of Bernoulli trials, viz.,\na sequence of trials with two outcomes in which the probability of\ngetting either outcome is the same on each trial; it leaves only a\nsingle parameter to be evaluated). As long as we have good reason to\nbelieve that this model applies, our inference to the high probability\nof the hypothesis is a matter of standard statistical methodology, and\nthe null support thesis is refuted.\n\nIt has been argued that one of the limitations of Bayesianism is that\nit is fatally committed to the (clearly false) null support thesis\n(Glymour 1980). The standard Bayesian condition by which evidence\ne supports h is given by the inequality \\(p(h\\mid e) \\gt\np(h)\\). But where e is known (and thus \\(p(e) = 1\\)), we have\n\\(p(h\\mid e) = p(h)\\). This came to be known as the \u2018Bayesian\nproblem of old evidence\u2019. Howson (1984) noted that this problem\ncould be overcome by selecting a probability function \\(p^*\\) based on\nthe assumption that e was not known\u2014thus even if\n\\(p(h\\mid e) = p(h)\\), it could still hold that \\({p^*}(h\\mid e) \\gt\n{p^*}(h)\\). Thus followed an extensive literature on the old evidence\nproblem which will not be summarized here (see, e.g., Christiansen\n1999; Eells & Fitelson 2000; Barnes 1999, 2008: Ch. 7; and\nHartmann & Fitelson 2015).\n6 Contemporary Theories of Predictivism\n",
