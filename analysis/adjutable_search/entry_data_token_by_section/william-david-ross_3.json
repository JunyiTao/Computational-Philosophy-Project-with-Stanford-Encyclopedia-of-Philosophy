Broad writes\nThe Right and the Good was \u2018much the most important\ncontribution to ethical theory made in England for a generation\u2019\n(Broad 1940, 228). The best explanation of Broad\u2019s praise is the\nbook clarifies and defends a novel form of deontology, according to\nwhich there are a plurality of moral requirements and non-instrumental\ngoods. No one master principle explains why the particular things we\nbelieve are wrong/right are in fact wrong/right. Instead, there exist\na number of basic, defeasible moral principles resisting reduction to\nsome more fundamental principle. These principles are relied upon in\nmaking decisions about what we ought to do, though there is no sense\nin which we deduce what we ought to do from principles. No one\nnon-instrumental good/evil explains why the particular things we think\nare good/evil are in fact good/evil. Instead, there exist a number of\nnon-instrumental goods which cannot be reduced to some more\nfundamental non-instrumental good. These goods are appealed to in\nmaking decisions about the goodness or badness of a state of affairs\nall things considered, though there is no sense in which this is\ndeduced from these claims. Ross\u2019s clearheaded and forceful\nexpression of this view makes his work of lasting philosophical\nsignificance.\n",
