Is Morality Unified Enough to Define?\n\nAn assumption suggested by the very existence of this encyclopedia\nentry is that there is some unifying set of features in virtue of\nwhich all moral systems count as moral systems. But Sinnott-Armstrong\n(2016) directly argues against an analogous hypothesis in connection\nwith moral judgments, and also seems to take this view to suggest that\nmorality itself is not a unified domain. He points out that moral\njudgments cannot be unified by any appeal to the notion of harm to\nothers, since there are such things as moral ideals, and there are\nharmless behaviors that a significant number of people regard as\nmorally wrong: Sinnott-Armstrong gives example such as cannibalism and\nflag-burning. Whether people who condemn such behaviors morally are\ncorrect in those judgments is largely irrelevant to the question of\nwhether they count as moral in the first place.\n\nSinnott-Armstrong seems right in holding that moral judgments cannot\nbe delimited from other judgments simply by appeal to their content.\nIt seems quite possible for someone to have been raised in such a way\nas to hold that it is morally wrong for adult men to wear shorts. And\nit also seems plausible that, as he also argues, moral judgments\ncannot be identified by reference to any sort of neurological feature\ncommon and peculiar to them and them alone. A third strategy might be\nto claim that moral judgments are those one makes as a result of\nhaving been inducted into a social practice that has a certain\nfunction. However, this function cannot simply be to help facilitate\nthe sorts of social interactions that enable societies to flourish and\npersist, since too many obviously non-moral judgments do this.\n\nBeyond the problem just described, attempts to pick out moral codes in\nthe descriptive sense by appeal to their function often seem to be\nspecifying the function that the theorist thinks morality, in the\nnormative sense, would serve, rather than the function that actual\nmoralities do serve. For example, Greene claims that \n\n\nmorality is a set of psychological adaptations that allow otherwise\nselfish individuals to reap the benefits of cooperation, (2013: 23)\n\n\n\nand Haidt claims that \n\n\nmoral systems are interlocking sets of values, virtues, norms,\npractices, identities, institutions, technologies, and evolved\npsychological mechanisms that work together to suppress or regulate\nself-interest and make cooperative societies possible. (2011: 270)\n\n\n\nBut these claims need to deal with the existence of dysfunctional\nmoralities that do not in fact serve these functions. Perhaps this\nproblem could be alleviated by pointing out that many instances of a\nkind that have a function\u2014for example, an actual human\nheart\u2014fail to fulfill that function.\n\nEven if Sinnott-Armstrong\u2019s position is correct with regard to\nmorality in the descriptive sense, there might nevertheless be a code\nof conduct that, given certain specified conditions, would be put\nforward by all rational agents. That is, even if the descriptive sense\nof morality is a family-resemblance notion, vaguely bordered and\nopen-textured, or even if it is significantly disjunctive and\ndisunified, the normative sense might not be. By way of comparison, we\nmight think of the notion of food in two ways: as what people regard\nas food, and as what they would regard as food if they were rational and\nfully informed. Certainly there is not much that unifies the first\ncategory: not even being digestible or nutritious, since people regard\nvarious indigestible and non-nutritious substances as food, and forego\nmuch that is digestible and nutritious. But that does not mean that we\ncannot theorize about what it would be rational to regard as food.\n",
