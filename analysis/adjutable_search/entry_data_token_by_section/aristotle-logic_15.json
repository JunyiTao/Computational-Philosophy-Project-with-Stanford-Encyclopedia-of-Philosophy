    "main_text": "The Syllogistic || Syllogisms with Modalities\n5.6 Syllogisms with Modalities\n\nAristotle follows his treatment of \u201carguments in the\nfigures\u201d with a much longer, and much more problematic,\ndiscussion of what happens to these figured arguments when we add the\nqualifications \u201cnecessarily\u201d and \u201cpossibly\u201d to\ntheir premises in various ways. In contrast to the syllogistic itself\n(or, as commentators like to call it, the assertoric\nsyllogistic), this modal syllogistic appears to be much less\nsatisfactory and is certainly far more difficult to interpret. Here, I\nonly outline Aristotle\u2019s treatment of this subject and note some\nof the principal points of interpretive controversy.\n5.6.1 The Definitions of the Modalities\n\nModern modal logic treats necessity and possibility as interdefinable:\n\u201cnecessarily P\u201d is equivalent to \u201cnot possibly not\nP\u201d, and \u201cpossibly P\u201d to \u201cnot necessarily not\nP\u201d. Aristotle gives these same equivalences in On\nInterpretation. However, in Prior Analytics, he makes a\ndistinction between two notions of possibility. On the first, which he\ntakes as his preferred notion, \u201cpossibly P\u201d is equivalent\nto \u201cnot necessarily P and not necessarily not P\u201d. He then\nacknowledges an alternative definition of possibility according to the\nmodern equivalence, but this plays only a secondary role in his\nsystem.\n5.6.2 Aristotle\u2019s General Approach\n\nAristotle builds his treatment of modal syllogisms on his account of\nnon-modal (assertoric) syllogisms: he works his way\nthrough the syllogisms he has already proved and considers the\nconsequences of adding a modal qualification to one or both premises.\nMost often, then, the questions he explores have the form: \u201cHere\nis an assertoric syllogism; if I add these modal qualifications to the\npremises, then what modally qualified form of the conclusion (if any)\nfollows?\u201d. A premise can have one of three modalities: it can be\nnecessary, possible, or assertoric. Aristotle works through the\ncombinations of these in order:\n\nTwo necessary premises\nOne necessary and one assertoric premise\nTwo possible premises\nOne assertoric and one possible premise\nOne necessary and one possible premise\n\n\nThough he generally considers only premise combinations which\nsyllogize in their assertoric forms, he does sometimes extend this;\nsimilarly, he sometimes considers conclusions in addition to those\nwhich would follow from purely assertoric premises.\n\nSince this is his procedure, it is convenient to describe modal\nsyllogisms in terms of the corresponding non-modal syllogism plus a\ntriplet of letters indicating the modalities of premises and\nconclusion: \\(N\\) = \u201cnecessary\u201d, \\(P\\) =\n\u201cpossible\u201d, \\(A\\) = \u201cassertoric\u201d. Thus,\n\u201cBarbara \\(NAN\\)\u201d would mean \u201cThe form\nBarbara with necessary major premise, assertoric minor\npremise, and necessary conclusion\u201d. I use the letters\n\u201c\\(N\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(P\\)\u201d as prefixes for premises\nas well; a premise with no prefix is assertoric. Thus,\nBarbara \\(NAN\\) would be \\(NAab, Abc \\vdash NAac\\).\n5.6.3 Modal Conversions\n\nAs in the case of assertoric syllogisms, Aristotle makes use of\nconversion rules to prove validity. The conversion rules for necessary\npremises are exactly analogous to those for assertoric premises:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nNEab &\\rightarrow NEba \\\\\n NIab &\\rightarrow NIba \\\\\n NAab &\\rightarrow NIba \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nPossible premises behave differently, however. Since he defines\n\u201cpossible\u201d as \u201cneither necessary nor\nimpossible\u201d, it turns out that \\(x\\) is possibly \\(F\\)\nentails, and is entailed by, \\(x\\) is possibly not \\(F\\).\nAristotle generalizes this to the case of categorical sentences as\nfollows: \n\\[\\begin{align}\nPAab &\\rightarrow PEab \\\\\n PEab &\\rightarrow PAab \\\\\n PIab &\\rightarrow POab \\\\\n POab &\\rightarrow PIab \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nIn addition, Aristotle uses the intermodal principle \\(N\\rightarrow\nA\\): that is, a necessary premise entails the corresponding assertoric\none. However, because of his definition of possibility, the principle\n\\(A\\rightarrow P\\) does not generally hold: if it did, then\n\\(N\\rightarrow P\\) would hold, but on his definition\n\u201cnecessarily \\(P\\)\u201d and \u201cpossibly \\(P\\)\u201d are\nactually inconsistent (\u201cpossibly \\(P\\)\u201d entails\n\u201cpossibly not \\(P\\)\u201d).\n\nThis leads to a further complication. The denial of \u201cpossibly\n\\(P\\)\u201d for Aristotle is \u201ceither necessarily \\(P\\) or\nnecessarily not \\(P\\)\u201d. The denial of \u201cnecessarily\n\\(P\\)\u201d is still more difficult to express in terms of a\ncombination of modalities: \u201ceither possibly \\(P\\) (and thus\npossibly not \\(P\\)) or necessarily not \\(P\\)\u201d This is important\nbecause of Aristotle\u2019s proof procedures, which include proof\nthrough impossibility. If we give a proof through impossibility in\nwhich we assume a necessary premise, then the conclusion we ultimately\nestablish is simply the denial of that necessary premise, not a\n\u201cpossible\u201d conclusion in Aristotle\u2019s sense. Such\npropositions do occur in his system, but only in exactly this way,\ni.e., as conclusions established by proof through impossiblity from\nnecessary assumptions. Somewhat confusingly, Aristotle calls such\npropositions \u201cpossible\u201d but immediately adds \u201c not\nin the sense defined\u201d: in this sense, \u201cpossibly\n\\(Oab\\)\u201d is simply the denial of \u201cnecessarily\n\\(Aab\\)\u201d. Such propositions appear only as premises, never as\nconclusions.\n5.6.4 Syllogisms with Necessary Premises\n\nAristotle holds that an assertoric syllogism remains valid if\n\u201cnecessarily\u201d is added to its premises and its conclusion:\nthe modal pattern \\(NNN\\) is always valid. He does not treat this as a\ntrivial consequence but instead offers proofs; in all but two cases,\nthese are parallel to those offered for the assertoric case. The\nexceptions are Baroco and Bocardo, which he proved\nin the assertoric case through impossibility: attempting to use that\nmethod here would require him to take the denial of a necessary \\(O\\)\nproposition as hypothesis, raising the complication noted above, and\nhe uses the procedure he calls ecthesis instead (see Smith\n1982).\n5.6.5 The Problem of the \u201cTwo Barbaras\u201d and Other Problems of Interpretation\n\nSince a necessary premise entails an assertoric premise, every \\(AN\\)\nor \\(NA\\) combination of premises will entail the corresponding \\(AA\\)\npair, and thus the corresponding \\(A\\) conclusion. Thus, \\(ANA\\) and\n\\(NAA\\) syllogisms are always valid. However, Aristotle holds that\nsome, but not all, \\(ANN\\) and \\(NAN\\) combinations are valid.\nSpecifically, he accepts Barbara \\(NAN\\) but rejects\nBarbara \\(ANN\\). Almost from Aristotle\u2019s own time,\ninterpreters have found his reasons for this distinction obscure, or\nunpersuasive, or both, and often have not followed his view. His close\nassociated Theophrastus, for instance, adopted the simpler rule that\nthe modality of the conclusion of a syllogism was always the\n\u201cweakest\u201d modality found in either premise, where \\(N\\) is\nstronger than \\(A\\) and \\(A\\) is stronger than \\(P\\) (and where \\(P\\)\nprobably has to be defined as \u201cnot necessarily not\u201d).\n\nBeginning with Albrecht Becker, interpreters using the methods of\nmodern formal logic to interpret Aristotle\u2019s modal logic have\nseen the Two-Barbaras problem as only one of a series of difficulties\nin giving a coherent interpretation of the modal syllogistic. A very\nwide range of reconstructions has been proposed: see Becker 1933,\nMcCall 1963, Nortmann 1996, Van Rijen 1989, Patterson 1995, Thomason\n1993, Thom 1996, Rini 2012, Malink 2013. The majority of\nreconstructions do not attempt to reproduce every detail of\nAristotle\u2019s exposition but instead produce modified\nreconstructions that abandon some of those results. Malink 2013,\nhowever, offers a reconstruction that reproduces everything Aristotle\nsays, although the resulting model introduces a high degree of\ncomplexity. (This subject quickly becomes too complex for summarizing\nin this brief article.\n",
