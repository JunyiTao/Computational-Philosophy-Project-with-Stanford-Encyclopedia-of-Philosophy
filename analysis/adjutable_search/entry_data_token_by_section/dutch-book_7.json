    "main_text": "A Dutch Book Argument for Countable Additivity\n3. A Dutch Book Argument for Countable Additivity\n\nGiven a countable infinity of mutually exclusive and exhaustive ways\n\\(W_i\\) in which the proposition \\(A\\) can be true, the\nPrinciple of Countable Additivity requires that \n\n\\[ \\pr(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\pr(W_i). \\]\n\n\nA Dutch Book argument can be constructed for the principle by\nextending the Dutch Book for finite additivity (Adams 1962; Jeffrey\n2004; Williamson 1999) by appealing to an infinite set of bets that\neach pay $1 if \\(W_i\\) is true for the price \\(\\pr(W_i)\\). In the case\nof the Dutch Book argument for countable additivity, there is an\nadditional reason beyond those for the basic argument to favor the\ninterpretation of it, as Jeffrey does, as establishing the principle\nas a consistency constraint, since the loss is purely theoretical.\nThere is no threat of an actual loss to an agent since this would\nrequire an infinite series of bets, which cannot all be made and\nsettled. However, the principle itself is controversial, making the\nDutch Book argument for countable additivity highly provocative. Both\nde Finetti (1972) and Savage (1954) argued that the principle should\nnot be invoked as a constraint on rational degrees of belief.  A\nconsequence of the principle is that it prohibits positive credences\nthat are uniformly distributed over a countably infinite partition,\nand yet it seems at least acceptable, in the absence of a reason to\nfavor some possibilities over others, to adopt such a distribution.\nIntuitively, a uniform distribution ought to count as consistent,\nwhich puts pressure on the idea, at least when it comes to countable\nadditivity, that Dutch Books reveal a defect that is substantially\nanalogous to inconsistency. In the background, as with the basic\nargument, the Dutch Book argument for countable additivity makes\nsignificant assumptions about how degrees of belief are linked with\npreference and assessments of value. For details concerning how these\nrelate to the demand that an agent\u2019s degrees of belief satisfy\ncountable additivity, see (Seidenfeld and Schervish 1983).  For a\nrecent critical discussion of the argument, see Pettigrew (2020).\n",
