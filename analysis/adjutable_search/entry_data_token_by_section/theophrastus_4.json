    "main_text": "Biology: Human Physiology, Zoology and Botany\n5. Biology: Human Physiology, Zoology and Botany\n\nTheophrastus\u2019 extensive monographs on botany fortunately\nsurvive, but we have very few of his works in human\nphysiology\u2014namely, On Sweat, On Fatigue, On\nDizziness\u2014and only summaries and reports of his works in\nzoology, apart from one that is preserved in manuscripts, the short\ntreatise On Fish.\n\nConcerning the human body and its functions (frs. 328\u2013349\nFHS&G), Theophrastus seems to have followed Aristotle in\npostulating four basic qualities (hot, cold, dry, wet), and in\nascribing to the heart a central role. He also emphasized the function\nof breath or spirit (pneuma), which is meant to keep the body\nand the soul of human beings together, linking psychic functions with\nphysical motions (fr. 346 FHS&G). In fact, it has been argued that\nin this case, too, Theophrastus diverged from Aristotle, since\nAristotle thought that pneuma was concentrated in the area of\nthe heart while Theophrastus claimed that it extends throughout the\nbody; however, Aristotle\u2019s position on this issue is\ncontroversial (see Longrigg 1993: 173\u20136).\n\nThe titles of Theophrastus\u2019 zoological treatises, as well as our\ntestimonies with regard to his research in this area, suggest that he\ndid not pursue Aristotle\u2019s interest in the anatomical structure\nof living creatures, but tried to supplement the Aristotelian approach\nwith observations on animal behaviour and its causes. The variations\nin animals resulting from different local environments, the generation\nof swarming creatures and the nuisance caused by them, the\npsychological qualities shared by animals with humans, and hibernation\nand reproduction, are some of the themes in Theophrastus\u2019\nzoological works that our secondary sources discuss (frs.\n350\u2013383 FHS&G). Some of these Theophrastus introduced as\nstrange and paradoxical, for some he offered multiple explanations, in\nsome cases he simply repeated the Aristotelian view, in others it is\ndisputable whether or not his account differed considerably from\nAristotle\u2019s. For instance, in the case of spontaneous\nreproduction (frs. 376\u2013383 FHS&G), some scholars have\nclaimed that Theophrastus shared Aristotle\u2019s views, while others\nhave insisted that he is certainly more sceptical than Aristotle. It\nhas also been suggested that Theophrastus agreed with the Aristotelian\ndoctrine in the Metaphysics (\u0396 7 1032a30), according to\nwhich the same plants and animals can come either from seed or\nspontaneously, but not with Aristotle\u2019s view in his biology that\nthere is a sharp distinction between the plants and animals that are\ngenerated from inanimate matter and those that never are (e.g., On\nthe Generation of Animals 1.1 715b8\u201315); in fact, this\nsuggestion has been presented as evidence in favour of the thesis that\nsome of Theophrastus\u2019 zoological works may have been written\nbefore Aristotle\u2019s biological treatises (see Balme 1962).\n\nInterestingly enough, Theophrastus\u2019 comments on animal behaviour\nhave often raised the question of how far he considered it to be\nanalogous to human behaviour. By showing, in particular, an interest\nin intelligent animal behaviour, he seems to have somewhat effaced the\nline between humans and other animals. According to Porphyry\u2019s\ntreatise On Abstinence From Eating Meat, Theophrastus\nstressed a natural relationship (oikeiot\u0113s) among all\nhuman beings, but also between human beings and other animals. This\nrelationship, however, is not to be confused with Stoic\noikei\u014dsis; for the latter starts as an innate and\nself-regarding impulse of newly born creatures that is modified over\ntime, so that an individual comes to realize the priority of virtue\nover soundness of body, whereas Theophrastus\u2019 notion designates\na kinship based on common bodily and psychical characteristics (see\nBrink 1956; Long 1998). So, in the case of the relationship between\nhumans and other animals, Theophrastus claimed that humans are akin to\nanimals because they are made of the same skin, flesh and fluids, and\nmost importantly because their souls are no different in desires,\nangry impulses, reasonings and above all sensations (fr. 531\nFHS&G). But if the mention here of reasonings or calculations\n(logismoi) is pressed, then Theophrastus can be understood as\nseriously deviating from Aristotle, who stated in his treatise On\nthe soul (3.10 433a12) that animals did not have the ability of\nreasoning. Also, at the beginning of his treatise Enquiry into\nPlants, Theophrastus stated that animals differ from plants\nbecause they act (prattein). But assuming that Theophrastus\nshared Aristotle\u2019s requisite for action (praxis),\nnamely that in acting one exercises one\u2019s reason, his ascription\nof actions to animals implies that they have a reasoning faculty of at\nleast some sort, though it is not entirely clear how he supported this\nclaim.\n\nThis relationship between animals and humans stands behind\nTheophrastus\u2019 aversion to animal sacrifice as an unjust act\nincompatible with holiness (fr. 584A FHS&G). In his treatise\nOn Piety (see P\u00f6tscher 1964), Theophrastus argued that\nthere are three reasons humans offer sacrifices to gods: to show\nhonour, or gratitude, or to get a favour. But humans cannot show\nhonour, or gratitude, or expect a favour, by doing harm and by\ncommitting an injustice. And since sacrificing an animal does cause\nharm, for it robs the animal of its soul, it should be considered as\nunjust. In fact, the idea that animals can be treated unjustly is\nrather important, since it suggests that in this respect, too,\nTheophrastus departed from Aristotle, who had claimed in his ethical\nwritings that animals are not moral agents, and cannot be recipients\nof injustice. It is worth pointing out, however, that\nTheophrastus\u2019 different approach to animal intelligence and\ncharacter has been interpreted more as a matter of different emphasis\nthan as a deliberate divergence. That is to say, it has been argued\nthat while Aristotle had underlined dissimilarities between humans and\nother animals, Theophrastus stressed deep underlying similarities, so\nthat the chasm that Aristotle had recognized between humans and other\nanimals became for Theophrastus less important than the chasm between\nanimals and plants (see Browning Cole 1992).\n\nTheophrastus\u2019 two main botanical treatises, Enquiry into\nPlants and Plant Explanations, have stood the test of\ntime better than Aristotle\u2019s zoological works. Especially, the\nEnquiry into Plants (Historia Plantarum) is\nconsidered as one of the most important books of natural history in\nantiquity, along with Pliny the Elder\u2019s Natural History\nand Dioscorides\u2019 De Materia Medica. It was written some\ntime between c. 350 and c. 287 BCE in ten volumes, of which nine\nsurvive. Theophrastus seems to have continually revised the\nmanuscript, and it remained in an unfinished state on his death.\nJudging from its condensed style and the many lists of examples,\nTheophrastus may have used it as notes for teaching purposes, rather\nthan intending it to be read as a book. He investigated in it over 550\nspecies of plants and showed great interest in their structure, growth\nand reproduction, their varieties around the world, the wood of\ndifferent trees and the effects of climate on it, the wild and\ncultivated plants, the classification and uses of herbs, cereals and\nlegumes; finally, in book 9 he presented the medicinal uses of plants,\ndescribed the juices, gums and resins extracted from them, and\nexplained how to gather them from different regions (see Desautels\n1988).\n\nThe purpose of Theophrastus\u2019 botanical treatises seems the same\nas that of Aristotle\u2019s zoological writings; first, in the\nEnquiry into Plants, he aimed at identifying the plants and\nat gathering all the available information about them, then, in the\nPlant Explanations, he proceeded to account for their common\nor distinctive characteristics. So, Theophrastus methodically laid out\nall the differences among plants, by distinguishing major categories\nand by drawing successive subdivisions within each of these\ncategories; this involved the close study of the parts of plants,\ntheir morphology and reproduction, as well as relevant factors of\nhabitat and cultivation. On the basis of such research, he\nsubsequently undertook to discover their causes, and thus to acquire\nbetter understanding (see W\u00f6hrle 1985, 2019: 31\u201356). It is\nno exaggeration to say that the history of botany owes to Theophrastus\nthe first systematic classification and explanation of plants and\ntheir uses.\n",
