    "main_text": "Identity\n4. Identity\n\n\nThe interplay of biological and social identities\u2014whether these be\ninnate, imposed, or embraced\u2014has become a subject of first-order\nimportance in disability studies as well as in feminist theory, and\nespecially in philosophical ventures into disability scholarship.\nFeminists have been, by far, the most numerous of philosophical writers\non the topic of disability identity. They have offered a rich\nvariety of sophisticated approaches to the question of how the\nsensibilities and histories of people with very different kinds of\nlimitations can be collected into a cohesive philosophical\naccount. Some write from the perspective of a lifelong disability\nidentity, others describe their transition into the world of\ndisability, and still others write about disability without having\nexperienced being disabled themselves.\n\n\nIn view of the relevance of so many different standpoints, feminist\nphilosophy of disability must meet the challenge of constructing an\naccount of disability identity that does not invoke or appeal to\n\u201cnormal\u201d examples of disabled people. Further, no one\nshould claim to be, or speak as or about, the typical disabled\nperson. The enormous diversity among disabled people, and the\nimportance of reflecting all their differences in formulating\ndisability theory, calls for sensitivity to nuance and context.\n(Re)formulations of feminist identity theory that can accommodate the\nmany ways in which disabled people differ from each other as well as\nfrom nondisabled people are of special importance because they may be\nextrapolated beyond disability theory to illuminate issues about\nidentities shaped by other kinds of differences.\n\n\nUnlike traditional ideas of race and sex, disability has always been\nunderstood to be a permeable classification. Some\npeople have lived at length or lifelong with disability, some are newly\nso, and others have lived through periods in which they were disabled\nbut now are not so. A large number of us should expect to become\ndisabled later in our lives. And many of us find ourselves\nintimately involved in the lives of family members or friends who now\nare disabled or who face a future of disability. Further, as Eva Kittay\nreminds us, social policies that pertain to disabled people also affect\ntheir family members, friends and professional caregivers (Kittay 1998;\nKittay 2001). So feminist disability theory should\nrecognize that disability affects the identities of many people beyond\nthe 600 million worldwide who are themselves disabled (Herr, Gostin,\nand Kuh 2003).\n\n\nDisability identity may be claimed for a variety of very different\nreasons. Sometimes the objective is to acquire eligibility for assuming\nthe \u201csick\u201d role and thereby being relieved of various\nproductivity-related expectations and responsibilities . Sometimes\nbeing identified as disabled offers access to government benefits of various\nkinds. Sometimes being understood to be disabled triggers\nacceptance of or accommodation to atypical modes of functioning.\nAnd sometimes disability identity is claimed as an empowering element\nof a political process intended to consolidate a group of people\nsufficiently numerous and vigorous to challenge stigmatization,\nexploitation, and exclusion based on disability. As the reasons\nfor these disparate purposes for identifying as disabled diverge, so do\nthe criteria or conditions for judging individuals to be disabled, as\nwell as the inducements to individuals to understand themselves\nprimarily in terms relating to disability.\n\n\nThe inclusiveness of the various identity theories promoted in\nfeminist philosophy is of preeminent and persistent concern to women\nwith disabilities. Discussing whether women with disabilities can\ncomfortably be feminists, Anita Silvers has asked whether feminism\nprivileges the functional capabilities and social roles characteristic\nof \u201cnormal\u201d women. She has found some feminist theories\nguilty of \u201cmagnifying these (functional capabilities of typical\nwomen) until they become standards of womanhood against which disabled\nwomen shrink into invisibility\u201d (1998a).\n\n\nFeminist philosophy validates and valorizes activities women\ntypically execute and in which they excel, such as theories of maternal\nethics that center on mothering as preeminent moral conduct. But\nnot all women are admitted to women's roles. Even in the most\nprogressive contemporary societies, women with disabilities encounter\nopposition to their maintaining fertility, or accessing reproductive\nmedical technology in achieving fertility, or even retaining custody of\nthe children to which they have given birth. Karin Barron, who\nhas conducted extensive research on the lives of young women with\ndisabilities, observes that we place great value on the womanly art of\ncaring for dependents, but the traditional dependent position of young\nwomen with disabilities prevents them from occupying, and therefore\nfrom demonstrating any aptitude for, this role (1997). We should\nbe clear that what precluded the young women Barron studied from being\nhomemakers and mothers was not their lack of potential for serving in\nthese roles but, instead, their having been assigned to an\nalternative social position, one defined in terms of such\ndependence that their capacity to nurture others became virtually\ninconceivable.\n\n\nLicia Carlson has shown that a gendered process of conceptualizing\nsocial roles even affected the diagnostic classification of mental\nretardation. She has explored the complex interconnections that\ncharacterize the linked history of cognitive disability and gender\noppression. Carlson points out that while superintendents of\ninstitutions that warehoused intellectually disabled people were mostly\nmale, women were employed to go out and identify cases of\nfeeblemindedness on the theory that they were more intuitive by nature\nand therefore better qualified for the job. This was an era when\nnormal women were presumed to have a leading role in defending society\nagainst moral weakness of the sorts for which the feebleminded were\nfeared, based on a notion about women's commitment to maintain\ncommunity virtue for protection of the young. While there is value in\nacknowledging human vulnerability and dependence, Carlson observes,\nfeminists should be as concerned about placing persons with\nintellectual disabilities in such mirror roles as about making third\nworld feminism a mirror for Western feminism (Carlson 2009;\nalso see Narayan 1997). \n\n\nCarlson's analysis should compel feminist philosophers to reconsider\ntheir understanding of cognitive disability. Feminist philosophers are\nnot immunized by their philosophical persuasion against their having\nlimitations such as ignorance of the lived realities of people with\nintellectual disabilities, the nature of intellectual disability, and\nthe historical basis of this category (Carlson 2009,2010). As\nfeminists have questioned the privileged status of masculine ways of\nthinking, Carlson questions whether some feminists privilege their own\nmodes and levels of cognition (Carlson 2001). They should, further, ask\nwhether they have constructed feminist philosophizing in terms that\nmake intellectual endeavor too central an undertaking. Eva Kittay\nmakes this point penetrating, poignant, and personal when she\ndescribes the transformative insight occasioned by being told that her\nchild is congenitally mentally retarded:\n\n\nthe worst anticipation was that her handicap involved her intellectual\nfaculties. \u2026. I was committed to a life of the mind.  \u2026\nHow was I to raise a daughter that would have no part of this? If my\nlife took its meaning from thought, what kind of meaning would her\nlife have? \u2026. [W]e already knew that we had learned\nsomething. That which we believed we valued, what\nwe\u2014I\u2014thought was at the center of humanity\u2014the\ncapacity for thought for reason, was not it, not it at all. (Kittay\n1998, 150)\n\n\nA somewhat similar dilemma about the preeminent value of intellectual\nskills may confront people who acquire a cognitive disability later in\ntheir lives. Kate Lindemann (2001) and Ann Davis (2005) both write\nabout the effects that experiencing the sequelae of head injuries had\non their beliefs about cognition.  Lindemann's critique points to\nradical and profound ways in which feminist appreciation of the\ndiverse workings of mind can enlarge philosophical inquiry. Feminist\ntheory stands to gain by paying new attention to philosophical issues\nthat should be rethought to reflect the situation of adults with brain\ninjuries: personal identity, mind-body dualism, conceptions of the\nself, and philosophical psychology.\n\n\nRecognizing that some individuals have invisible disabilities should\nremind us, Davis observes, of the extent to which we always are\nepistemologically dependent on people's disclosures of their own\nidentities. Davis rejects the presumption that we can clearly separate\nvoluntary from inadvertent limitations. Many cognitive and\npsychological limitations cannot be documented by reference to physical\nanomalies. Yet, Davis rightly says, experiences of them are no less\nreal. She rejects the conviction that we can find physical\ncorrelates of anomalous cognitive or psychological functioning.\nPolicies demanding that these kinds of cognitive and\npsychological limitations be documented by public demonstration or\nthird-party confirmation should be abandoned, for they rely on mere faith in\ntheir having physical causes rather than on factual evidence that they\ndo.\n\n\nThese personalized experiences of limitation should not be\ndiscounted. The philosophy of disability suggests that we need to\nrecalibrate our sensibilities to honor the evidence of other people's\nsenses, especially of their own embodiment. People's testimony\nabout their own limitations and incapacities deserves respect even if\nuncorroborated by biological confirmation. Such experienced limitations\nmay place the individual at activity-impeding, pain-inducing or\nlife-threatening risk. As Davis argues eloquently, we improperly\nburden people whose limitations we cannot directly see, and aren't\nsufficiently knowledgeable to appreciate, by constantly challenging\nthem to prove their disabilities.\n",
