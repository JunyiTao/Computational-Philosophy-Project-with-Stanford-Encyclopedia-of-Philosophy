    "main_text": "History and Scope\n1. History and Scope\n\n\nThe second half of the twentieth century saw the emergence of\nlarge-scale political movements\u2014second wave feminism, Black Civil\nRights in the U.S., gay and lesbian liberation, and the American Indian\nmovements, for example\u2014based in claims about the injustices done\nto particular social groups. These social movements are undergirded by\nand foster a philosophical body of literature that takes up questions\nabout the nature, origin and futures of the identities being defended.\nIdentity politics as a mode of organizing is intimately connected to\nthe idea that some social groups are oppressed; that is, that\none\u2019s identity as a woman or as African American, for example,\nmakes one peculiarly vulnerable to cultural imperialism (including\nstereotyping, erasure, or appropriation of one\u2019s group identity),\nviolence, exploitation, marginalization, or powerlessness (Young 1990).\nIdentity politics starts from analyses of such forms of social\ninjustice to recommend, variously, the reclaiming, redescription, or\ntransformation of previously stigmatized accounts of group membership.\nRather than accepting the negative scripts offered by a dominant\nculture about one\u2019s own inferiority, one transforms one\u2019s\nown sense of self and community. For example, in their germinal\nstatement of Black feminist identity politics, the Combahee River\nCollective argued that \n\n\n\nas children we realized that we were different from boys and that we\nwere treated different\u2014for example, when we were told in the same\nbreath to be quiet both for the sake of being \u2018ladylike\u2019\nand to make us less objectionable in the eyes of white people. In the\nprocess of consciousness-raising, actually life-sharing, we began to\nrecognize the commonality of our experiences and, from the sharing and\ngrowing consciousness, to build a politics that will change our lives\nand inevitably end our oppression. (1982: 14\u201315)\n\n\n\nThe scope of political movements that may be described as identity\npolitics is broad: the examples used in the philosophical literature\nare predominantly of struggles for recognition and social justice by\ngroups of citizens within western capitalist democracies, but\nIndigenous rights movements worldwide, nationalist projects, or demands\nfor regional self-determination use similar arguments. Predictably,\nthere is no straightforward criterion that makes a political struggle\ninto an example of \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Rather, the term\nsignifies a loose collection of political projects, each undertaken by\nrepresentatives of a collective with a distinctively different social\nlocation that has hitherto been neglected, erased, or suppressed. It is\nbeyond the scope of this essay to offer historical or sociological\nsurveys of the many different social movements that might be described\nas identity politics, although references to this literature are\nprovided in the bibliography; instead the focus here is to provide an\noverview of the philosophical issues in the expansive literature in\npolitical theory.\n\nThe phrase \u201cidentity politics\u201d is also something of a\nphilosophical punching-bag for a variety of critics. Often challenges\nfail to make sufficiently clear their object of critique, using\n\u201cidentity politics\u201d as a blanket description that invokes a\nrange of tacit political failings. From a contemporary perspective,\nsome early identity claims by political activists certainly seem naive,\ntotalizing, or unnuanced. However, the public rhetoric of identity\npolitics served useful and empowering purposes for some, even while it\nsometimes belied the philosophical complexity of any claim to a shared\nexperience or common group characteristics. Since the twentieth century\nheyday of the well-known political movements that made identity\npolitics so visible, a vast academic literature has sprung up; although\n\u201cidentity politics\u201d can draw on intellectual precursors\nfrom Mary Wollstonecraft to Franz Fanon, writing that actually uses\nthis specific phrase, with any of its contemporary baggage, does not\nbegin until the late 1970s. Thus it was barely as intellectuals started\nto systematically outline and defend the philosophical underpinnings of\nidentity politics that we simultaneously began to challenge them. At\nthis historical juncture, then, asking whether one is for or against\nidentity politics is to ask an impossible question. Wherever they line\nup in the debates, thinkers agree that the notion\nof identity has become indispensable to contemporary\npolitical discourse, at the same time as they concur that it has\ntroubling implications for models of the self, political inclusiveness,\nand our possibilities for solidarity and resistance.\n",
