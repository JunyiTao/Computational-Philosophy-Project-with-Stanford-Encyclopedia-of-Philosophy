Although some moral\nlearning may result from the theoretical work of moral philosophers\nand theorists, much of what we learn with regard to morality surely\narises in the practical context of deliberation about new and\ndifficult cases. This deliberation might be merely instrumental,\nconcerned only with settling on means to moral ends, or it might be\nconcerned with settling those ends. There is no special problem about\nlearning what conduces to morally obligatory ends: that is an ordinary\nmatter of empirical learning. But by what sorts of process can we\nlearn which ends are morally obligatory, or which norms morally\nrequired? And, more specifically, is strictly moral learning possible\nvia moral reasoning? \n\nMuch of what was said above with regard to moral uptake applies again\nin this context, with approximately the same degree of dubiousness or\npersuasiveness. If there is a role for moral perception or for\nemotions in agents\u2019 becoming aware of moral considerations,\nthese may function also to guide agents to new conclusions. For\ninstance, it is conceivable that our capacity for outrage is a\nrelatively reliable detector of wrong actions, even novel ones, or\nthat our capacity for pleasure is a reliable detector of actions worth\ndoing, even novel ones. (For a thorough defense of the latter\npossibility, which intriguingly interprets pleasure as a judgment of\nvalue, see Millgram 1997.) Perhaps these capacities for emotional\njudgment enable strictly moral learning in roughly the same way that\nchess-players\u2019 trained sensibilities enable them to recognize\nthe threat in a previously unencountered situation on the chessboard\n(Lance and Tanesini 2004). That is to say, perhaps our moral emotions\nplay a crucial role in the exercise of a skill whereby we come to be\nable to articulate moral insights that we have never before attained.\nPerhaps competing moral considerations interact in contextually\nspecific and complex ways much as competing chess considerations do.\nIf so, it would make sense to rely on our emotionally-guided\ncapacities of judgment to cope with complexities that we cannot model\nexplicitly, but also to hope that, once having been so guided, we\nmight in retrospect be able to articulate something about the lesson\nof a well-navigated situation. \n\nA different model of strictly moral learning puts the emphasis on our\nafter-the-fact reactions rather than on any prior, tacit emotional or\njudgmental guidance: the model of \u201cexperiments in living,\u201d\nto use John Stuart Mill\u2019s phrase (see Anderson 1991). Here, the\nbasic thought is that we can try something and see if \u201cit\nworks.\u201d For this to be an alternative to empirical learning\nabout what causally conduces to what, it must be the case that we\nremain open as to what we mean by things \u201cworking.\u201d In\nMill\u2019s terminology, for instance, we need to remain open as to\nwhat are the important \u201cparts\u201d of happiness. If we are,\nthen perhaps we can learn by experience what some of them are \u2013\nthat is, what are some of the constitutive means of happiness. These\npaired thoughts, that our practical life is experimental and that we\nhave no firmly fixed conception of what it is for something to\n\u201cwork,\u201d come to the fore in Dewey\u2019s pragmatist\nethics (see esp. Dewey 1967 [1922]). This experimentalist conception\nof strictly moral learning is brought to bear on moral reasoning in\nDewey\u2019s eloquent characterizations of \u201cpractical\nintelligence\u201d as involving a creative and flexible approach to\nfiguring out \u201cwhat works\u201d in a way that is thoroughly open\nto rethinking our ultimate aims. \n\nOnce we recognize that moral learning is a possibility for us, we can\nrecognize a broader range of ways of coping with moral conflicts than\nwas canvassed in the last section. There, moral conflicts were\ndescribed in a way that assumed that the set of moral considerations,\namong which conflicts were arising, was to be taken as fixed. If we\ncan learn, morally, however, then we probably can and should revise\nthe set of moral considerations that we recognize. Often, we do this\nby re-interpreting some moral principle that we had started with,\nwhether by making it more specific, making it more abstract, or in\nsome other way (cf. Richardson 2000 and 2018). \n",
