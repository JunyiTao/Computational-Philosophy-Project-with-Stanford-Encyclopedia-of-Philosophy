    "main_text": "Politics and Philosophy in Ancient Greece || Politics and Philosophy\n2.3 Politics and Philosophy\n\nIn giving birth to philosophy, the polis also gave birth to a\ntension between what Aristotle would describe as two lives: the life\nof politics and the life of philosophy. A faultline between ethics and\npolitics, so closely connected in an ancient culture preoccupied with\nflourishing (eudaimonia) and virtue (aret\u00ea),\nopened here. Should philosophers act politically (and if so,\nshould they engage in ordinary politics in existing regimes, or work\nto establish new ones), or should they abstain from politics in order\nto live a life of pure contemplation? There was likewise a question as\nto whether philosophers should think politically: were human\naffairs worth thinking about in the broadest perspective opened by the\nstudy of nature and of the gods? In engaging with questions of\nrhetoric, virtue, knowledge, and justice, Socrates\u2019\nphilosophical life was engaged with the political even before his\ndeath (his trial and execution at the hands of the Athenian democratic\nregime) embattled him with it. But for his student Plato and\nPlato\u2019s student Aristotle, the practice and even the study of\nhuman affairs such as politics were less divine, and so less\nadmirable, than the broader study of truth about the natural and the\ndivine realms. Philosophy might have to address the political but its\nhighest calling soared above it. If Socrates\u2019 political fate was\npart of the stimulus for Plato to invent a new metaphysics and\nepistemology in order to articulate an alternative realm of political\npossibility, Plato\u2019s dialogues show Socrates simultaneously\nasserting an independence for those disciplines from the bonds of the\npolitical\n alone.[5]\n\nThis distinctive Greek\u2014and particularly Platonic \u2013 outlook\nmust condition any historical understanding of the development of\nancient political philosophy. While one influential approach to the\nhistory of political thought takes its bearings from what a thinker\nwas trying to do in and by what he or she said or wrote, it is\nimportant to recognize that the founders of ancient political\nphilosophy were in part trying to define a new space of doing as\nphilosophizing, independent of ordinary political action. This is not\nto say that they did not also have ordinary political intentions, but\nrather to stress that the invention of political philosophy was also\nintended as a mode of reflection upon the value of ordinary political\nlife.\n",
