    "main_text": "Developments in the Philosophy of Neuroscience\n8. Developments over the Second Decade of the Twenty-First Century\n\nMechanism, first introduced in section 7 above, came to dominate the\nphilosophy of neuroscience throughout the second decade of the\ntwenty-first century. One much-discussed example is Gualtiero\nPiccinini and Carl Craver (2011). The authors employ two popular\nmechanistic notions. Their first is the multi-level, nested\nhierarchies of mechanisms-within-mechanisms perspective, discussed in\nsection 7 above, that traces back to Craver and Darden (2001). Their\nsecond is that of \u201cmechanism sketch\u201d, suggested initially\nin Machamer, Darden, and Craver (2000) and developed in detail in\nCraver (2007). Piccinini and Craver\u2019s goal is to\n\u201cseamlessly\u201d situate psychology as part of an\n\u201cintegrated framework\u201d alongside neuroscience. They\ninterpret psychology\u2019s familiar functional analyses of cognitive\ncapacities as relatively incomplete mechanism-sketches, which leave\nout many components of the mechanisms that ultimately will fully\nexplain the system\u2019s behavior. Neuroscience in turn fills in\nthese missing components, dynamics, and organizations, at least ones\nfound in nervous systems. This filling-in thereby turns\npsychology\u2019s mechanism-sketches into full-blown mechanistic\nexplanations. So even though psychology proceeds via functional\nanalyses, so interpreted it is nonetheless mechanistic. Piccinini and\nCraver realize that their \u201cintegrated\u201d account clashes\nwith classical \u201cautonomy\u201d claims for psychology vis-\u00e0-vis\nneuroscience. Nevertheless, they insist that their challenge to\nclassical \u201cautonomy\u201d does not commit them to\n\u201creductionism\u201d, in either its classical or more recent\nvarieties. Their commitment to nested hierarchy of\nmechanisms-within-mechanisms to account for a system\u2019s behavior\nacknowledges the importance of mechanisms and intralevel causation at\nall levels constituting the system, not just at lower (i.e., cellular,\nmolecular) levels.\n\nDavid Kaplan and Craver (2011) focus the mechanist perspective\ncritically on dynamical systems mathematical models popular in recent\nsystems and computational neuroscience. They argue that such models\nare explanatory only if there exists a \u201cplausible mapping\u201d\nbetween elements in the model and elements in the modeled system. At\nbottom is their Model-to-Mechanism-Mapping (3M) Constraint on\nexplanation. The variables in a genuinely explanatory model correspond\nto components, activities, or organizational features of the system\nbeing explained. And the dependencies posited among variables in the\nmodel, typically expressed mathematically in systems and computational\nneuroscience, correspond to causal relations among the system\u2019s\ncomponents. Kaplan and Craver justify the 3M Constraint on grounds of\nexplanatory norms, common to both science and common sense. All other\nthings being equal, they insist, explanations that provide more\nrelevant details about a system\u2019s components, activities, and\norganization, more likely will answer more questions about how the\nsystem will behave in a variety of circumstances, than will an\nexplanation that provides fewer (mechanistic) details.\n\u201cRelevant\u201d here pertains to the functioning of the\nspecific mechanism. Models from systems and computational neuroscience\nthat violate the 3M Constraint are thus more reasonably thought of as\nmathematical descriptions of phenomena, not explanations of some\n\u201cnon-mechanistic\u201d variety.\n\nKaplan and Craver challenge their own view with one of the more\npopular dynamical/mathematical models in all of computational\nneuroscience, the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (1985) model of human bimanual\nfinger-movement coordination. They point to passages in these\nmodelers\u2019 publications that suggest that the modelers only\nintended for their dynamical systems model to be a mathematically\ncompact description of the temporal evolution of a \u201cpurely\nbehavioral dependent variable\u201d. The modelers interpreted none of\nthe model\u2019s variables or parameters as mapping onto components\nor operations of any hypothetical mechanism generating the behavioral\ndata. Nor did they intend for any of the model\u2019s mathematical\nrelations or dependencies among variables to map onto hypothesized\ncausal interactions among components or activities of any mechanism.\nAs Kaplan and Craver further point out, after publishing their\ndynamicist model, these modelers themselves then began to investigate\nhow the behavioral regularities their model described might be\nproduced by neural motor system components, activities, and\norganization. Their own follow-up research suggests that these\nmodelers saw their dynamicist model as a heuristic, to help\nneuroscientists move toward \u201chow-possibly\u201d, and ultimately\nto a \u201chow-actually\u201d mechanistic explanation. \n\nAt bottom, Kaplan and Craver\u2019s 3M constraint on explanation\npresents a dilemma for dynamicists. To the extent that dynamical\nsystems modelers intend to model hypothesized neural mechanisms for\nthe phenomenon under investigation, their explanations will need to\ncohere with the 3M Constraint (and other canons of mechanistic\nexplanation). To the extent that this is not a goal of dynamicist\nmodelers, their models do not seem genuinely explanatory, at least not\nin one sense of \u201cexplanation\u201d prominent in the history of\nscience. Furthermore, when dynamicist models are judged to be\nsuccessful, they often prompt subsequent searches for underlying\nmechanisms, just as the 3M Constraint and the general mechanist\naccount of the move from \u201chow-possibly\u201d to \u201chow\nactually\u201d mechanisms recommends. Either horn gores dynamicists\nwho claim that their models constitute a necessary additional kind of\nexplanation in neuroscience to mechanistic explanation, beyond any\nheuristic value such models might offer toward discovering\nmechanisms.\n\nKaplan and Craver\u2019s radical conclusion, that dynamicist\n\u201cexplanations\u201d are genuine explanations only to the degree\nthat they respect the (mechanist\u2019s) 3M Constraint, needs more\ndefense. The burden of proof always lies on those whose conclusions\nstrike at popular assumptions. More than the discussion of a couple of\nlandmark dynamicist models in neuroscience is needed (in their 2011,\nKaplan and Craver also discuss the difference-of-Gaussians model of\nreceptive field properties of mammalian visual neurons). Expectedly,\ndynamicists have taken up this challenge. Michael Silberstein and\nAnthony Chemero (2013), for example, argue that localization and\ndecomposition strategies characterize mechanistic explanation, and\nthat some explanations in systems neuroscience violate one of these\nassumptions, or both. Such violations in turn create a dilemma for\nmechanists. Either they must \u201cstretch\u201d their account of\nexplanation, beyond decomposition and localization, to capture these\nrecalcitrant cases, or they must accept \u201ccounterexamples\u201d\nto the generality of mechanistic explanation, in both systems\nneuroscience and systems biology more generally.\n\nLauren Ross (2015) and Mazviita Chirimuuta (2014) independently appeal\nto Robert Batterman\u2019s account of minimal model explanation as an\nimportant kind of non-mechanistic explanation in neuroscience. Minimal\nmodels were developed initially to characterize a kind of explanation\nin the physical sciences (see, e.g., Batterman and Rice 2014).\nBatterman\u2019s account distinguishes between two different kinds of\nscientific \u201cwhy-questions\u201d: why a phenomenon manifests in\nparticular circumstances; and why a phenomenon manifests generally, or\nin a number of different circumstances. Mechanistic explanations\nanswer the first type of why-question. Here a \u201cmore details the\nbetter\u201d (MDB) assumption (Chirimuuta 2014), akin to Kaplan and\nCraver\u2019s \u201call things being equal\u201d assumption about\nbetter explanations (mentioned above), holds force. Minimal models,\nhowever, which minimize over the presented implantation details and\nhence violate MDB, are better able to answer the second type of\nscientific why-questions. Ross (2015), quoting from computational\nneuroscientists Rinzel and Ermentrout, insists that models containing\nmore details than necessary can obscure identification of critical\nelements by leaving too many open possibilities, especially when one\nis trying to answer Batterman\u2019s second kind of why-questions\nabout a system\u2019s behavior.\n\nChirimuuta and Ross each appeal to related resources from\ncomputational neuroscience to illustrate the applicability of\nBatterman\u2019s minimal model explanation strategy. Ross appeals to\n\u201ccanonical models\u201d, which represent \u201cshared\nqualitative features of a number of distinct neural systems\u201d\n(2015: 39). Her central example is the derivation of the\nErmentrout-Kopell model of class I neuron excitability, which uses\n\u201cmathematical abstraction techniques\u201d to \u201creduce\nmodels of molecularly distinct neural systems to a single \u2026\ncanonical model\u201d. Such a model \u201cexplains why molecularly\ndiverse neural systems all exhibit the same qualitative\nbehavior\u201d, (2015: 41) clearly a Batterman second-type\nwhy-question. Chirimuuta\u2019s resource is \u201ccanonical neural\ncomputations\u201d (CNCs): \n\n\ncomputational modules that apply the same fundamental operations in a\nvariety of contexts \u2026 a toolbox of computational operations\nthat the brain applies in a number of different sense modalities and\nanatomic regions and which can be described at higher levels of\nabstraction from their biophysical implementation. (Chirimuuta 2014:\n138) \n\n\nExamples include shunting inhibition, linear filtering, recurrent\namplification, and thresholding. Rather than being mechanism-sketches,\nawaiting further mechanistic details to be turned into full-blown\nhow-actually mechanisms, CNCs are invoked in a different explanatory\ncontext, namely, ones posing Batterman\u2019s second type of\nwhy-questions. Ross concurs concerning canonical models: \n\n\nUnderstanding the approach dynamical systems neuroscientists take in\nexplaining [system] behavior requires attending to their explanandum\nof interest and the unique modeling tools [e.g., canonical models]\ncommon in their field. (2015: 52) \n\n\nIn short, both Chirimuuta\u2019s and Ross\u2019s replies to Kaplan\nand Craver\u2019s challenge is a common one in philosophy: save a\nparticular form of explanation from collapsing into another by\nsplitting the explanandum.\n\nFinally, to wrap up this discussion of mechanism ascendant, an\nanalogue of Craver\u2019s (2007) problem of accounting for\n\u201cconstitutive mechanistic relevance\u201d, that is, for\ndetermining which active components of a system are actually part of\nthe mechanism for a given system phenomenon, has also re-emerged in\nrecent discussions. Robert Rupert (2009) suggests that\n\u201cintegration\u201d is a key criterion for determining which set\nof causally contributing mechanisms constitute the system for a task,\nbased on the relative frequency with which sets of mechanisms\nco-contribute to causing task occurrences. He cashes frequency of\nco-contribution as the probability of the set for causing the\ncognitive task, conditional to every other co-occurring causal set.\nFelipe De Brigard (2017) challenges Rupert\u2019s criterion, arguing\nthat it cannot account for cognitive systems displaying two features,\n\u201cdiachronic dynamicity\u201d along with \u201cfunctional\nstability\u201d. The frequency with which a given mechanism causally\ncontributes to the same cognitive task (functional stability) can\nchange over time (diachronic dynamicity). Although De Brigard\nemphasizes the critical importance of these features for\nRupert\u2019s integration criterion via a fanciful thought\nexperiment, he also argues that they are a widespread phenomenon in\nhuman brains. Both features are found, for example, in evidence\npertaining to the \u201cHemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Older\nAdults\u201d, in which tasks that recruit hemispherically localized\nregions of prefrontal cortex in younger adults show a reduction in\nhemispheric asymmetry in older adults. And both are found in\n\u201cPosterior-Anterior Shift with Aging\u201d, where a task\nincreases activity in anterior brain regions while decreasing activity\nin posterior regions in older adults, relative to activity invoked by\nthe same task in younger adults.\n\nTo replace Rupert\u2019s notion of integration as a criterion for\ndetermining which sets of mechanisms constitute a cognitive system, De\nBrigard points to two promising recent developments in network\nneuroscience which potentially allow for parametrized time.\n\u201cScaled inclusivity\u201d is a method for examining each node\nin a network and identifying its membership in \u201ccommunity\nstructures\u201d across different iterations of the network.\n\u201cTemporal-dynamic network analyses\u201d is a way to quantify\nchanges in community structures or modules between networks at\ndifferent time points. Both methods thereby identify \u201cmodular\nalliances\u201d, which convey both co-activation and dynamic change\ninformation in a single model. De Brigard suggests that these are thus\nthe candidates with which cognitive systems could be identified.\n\nClearly, much remains to be discussed regarding the impact mechanism\nhas come to wield in philosophy of neuroscience over the last decade.\nBut while mechanism has become the most dominant general perspective\nin the field, work in other areas continues. Michael Anderson defends\nthe relevance of cognitive neuroscience for determining\npsychology\u2019s taxonomy, independent of any commitment to\nmechanism. The most detailed development of his approach is in his\n(2014) book, After Phrenology, based on his influential\n\u201cneural reuse\u201d hypothesis. Each region of the brain, as\nrecognized by the standard techniques of cognitive neuroscience\n(especially fMRI), engages in cognitive functions that are highly\nvarious, and form different \u201cneural partnerships\u201d with one\nanother under different circumstances. Psychological categories are\nthen to be reconceived along lines suggested by the wide-ranging\nempirical data in support of neural reuse. A genuine\n\u201cpost-phrenological\u201d science of the mind must jettison the\nassumption that each brain region performs its own fundamental\ncomputation. In this fashion Anderson\u2019s work explicitly\ncontinues philosophy of neuroscience\u2019s ongoing interest in\nlocalizations of cognitive functions.\n\nIn shorter compass, Anderson (2015) investigates the relevance of\ncognitive neuroscience for reconceiving psychology\u2019s basic\ncategories, starting from a consequence of his neural reuse\nhypothesis. Attempts to map cognitive processes onto specific neural\nprocesses and brain regions reveal \u201cmany-to-many\u201d\nrelations. Not only do these relations show that combined\nanatomical-functional labels for brain regions (e.g., \u201cfusiform\nface area\u201d) are deceptive; they also call into question the\npossibility of deciding between alternative psychological taxonomies\nby appealing to cognitive neuroscientific data.\n\nFor all but the strongest proponents of psychology\u2019s autonomy\nfrom neuroscience, these many-to-many mappings will suggest that the\npsychological taxonomy we bring to this mapping project needs\nrevision. One need not be committed to any strong sense of\npsychoneural reduction, or the epistemological superiority of\ncognitive neuroscience to psychology, to draw this conclusion. The\nmere relevance of cognitive neuroscience for psychology\u2019s\ncategories is enough. This debate is thus \u201cabout the\nrequirements for a unified science of the mind, and the proper role of\nneurobiological evidence in the construction of such an\nontology\u201d (2015: 70), not about the legitimacy of either.\n\nAnderson divides revisionary projects for psychology into three kinds,\nbased on the degree of revision each kind recommends for psychology,\nand the extent of one-to-one function-to-structure mappings the\nproposed revisions predicts will be available.\n\u201cConservatives\u201d foresee little need for extensive\nrevisions of psychology\u2019s basic taxonomy, even as more\nneuroscientific evidence is taken into account than current standard\npractices pursue. \u201cModerates\u201d insist that our knowledge of\nbrain function \u201ccan (and should) act as one arbiter of the\npsychologically real\u201d (2015: 70), principally by\n\u201csplitting\u201d or \u201cmerging\u201d psychological\nconcepts that currently are in use. \u201cRadicals\u201d project\neven more drastic revisions, even to the most primitive concepts of\npsychology, and even after such revisions they still do not expect\nthat many one-to-one mappings between brain regions and the new\npsychological primitives will be found. Although Anderson does not\nstress this connection (eliminative materialism has not been a\nprominent concern in philosophy of mind or neuroscience for two\ndecades), readers will notice similar themes discussed in\n section 2\n above, only now with scientific, not folk psychology the target of\nthe radical revisionists. A key criterion for any satisfactory\nreformulation of a cognitive ontology is the degree to which it\nsupports two kinds of inferences: \u201cforward inferences\u201d,\nfrom the engagement of a specific cognitive function to the prediction\nof brain activity; and \u201creverse inferences\u201d, from the\nobservation that a specific brain region or pattern occurs to the\nprediction that a specific cognitive operation is engaged. In light of\nthis explicit criterion, Anderson usefully surveys the work of a\nnumber of prominent psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists in\neach of his revisionist groups. Given his broader commitment to neural\nreuse, and the trek it invites into \u201cevolutionarily-inspired,\necological, and enactive terms\u201d, Anderson\u2019s own sentiments\nlie with the \u201cradicals\u201d: \n\n\nlanguage and mathematics, for instance, are best understood as\nextensions of our basic affordance processing capacities augmented\nwith public symbol systems \u2026 The psychological science that\nresults from this reappraisal may well look very different from the\none we practice today. (2015: 75)\n\n\nLandmark neuroscientific hypotheses remain a popular focus in recent\nphilosophy of neuroscience. Berit Brogaard (2012), for example, argues\nfor a reinterpretation of the standard \u201cdissociation\u201d\nunderstanding of Melvin Goodale and David Milner\u2019s (1992)\ncelebrated \u201ctwo visual processing streams\u201d, a landmark,\nnow \u201ctextbook\u201d result from late-twentieth century\nneuroscience. Two components of the standard dissociation are key. The\nfirst is that distinct brain regions compute information relevant for\nvisually guided \u201con-the-fly\u201d actions, and for object\nrecognition, respectively, the dorsal stream (which runs from primary\nvisual cortex through the medial temporal region into the superior and\ninferior parietal lobules) and the ventral stream (which runs from\nprimary visual cortex through V4 and into inferior temporal cortex).\nAnd second, that only information relevant for visual object\nrecognition, processed in the ventral stream, contributes to the\ncharacter of conscious visual experiences.\n\nBrogaard\u2019s concern is that this standard understanding\nchallenges psychofunctionalism, our currently most plausible\n\u201cnaturalistic\u201d account of mental states.\nPsychofunctionalism draws its account of mind directly from our best\ncognitive psychology. If \u03c6 is some mental state type that has\ninherited the content of a visual experience, then according to\ncognitive psychology a wide range of visually guided beliefs and\ndesires, different kinds of visual memories, and so on, satisfy\n\u03c6\u2019s description. But by the standard\n\u201cdissociation\u201d account of Goodale and Milner\u2019s two\nvisual streams, only dorsal-stream states, and not ventral-stream\nstates, represent truly egocentric visual properties, namely\n\u201crelational properties which objects instantiate from the point\nof view of believers or perceivers\u201d, (Brogaard 2012: 572). But\naccording to cognitive psychology, dorsal-stream states do not play\nthis wide-ranging \u03c6-role. So according to psychofunctionalism\n\u201c\u03c6-mental states cannot represent egocentric\nproperties\u201d (2012: 572). But it seems \u201cenormously\nplausible\u201d that some of our perceptual beliefs and visual\nmemories represent egocentric properties. So either we reject\npsychofunctionalism, and so our most plausible naturalization project\nfor determining whether a given mental state is instantiated, or we\nreject the standard dissociation interpretation of Goodale and\nMilner\u2019s two visual streams hypothesis, despite the wealth of\nempirical evidence supporting it. Neither horn of this dilemma looks\ncomfortably graspable, although the first horn might be thought to be\nmore so, since psychofunctionalism as a general theory of mind lacks\nthe kind of strong empirical backing that the standard interpretation\nof Goodale and Milner\u2019s hypothesis enjoys.\n\nNevertheless, Brogaard recommends retaining psychofunctionalism, and\ninstead rejecting \u201ca particular formulation\u201d of Goodale\nand Milner\u2019s two visual stream hypothesis. The interpretation to\nreject insists that \u201cdorsal-stream information cannot contribute\nto the potentially conscious representations computed by the ventral\nstream\u201d (2012: 586\u2013587). Egocentric representations of\nvisual information computed by the dorsal stream contribute to\nconscious visual stream representations \u201cvia feedback\nconnections\u201d from dorsal- to ventral-stream neurons (2012: 586).\nThis isn\u2019t to deny dissociation: \n\n\nInformation about the egocentric properties of objects is processed by\nthe dorsal stream, and information about allocentric properties of\nobjects is processed by the ventral stream. (2012: 586) \n\n\nBut this dissociation hypothesis \u201chas no bearing on what\ninformation is passed on to parts of the brain that process\ninformation which correlated with visual awareness\u201d (2012: 586).\nWith this re-interpretation, psychofunctionalism is rendered\nconsistent with Goodale and Milner\u2019s two stream, dorsal and\nventral, \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwhere/how\u201d hypothesis and\nthe wealth of empirical evidence that supports it. According to\nBrogaard, psychofunctionalism can thereby \u201ccorrectly treat\nperceptual and cognitive states that carry information processed in\nthe ventral visual stream as capable of representing egocentric\nproperties\u201d (2012: 586).\n\nDespite philosophy of neuroscience\u2019s continuing focus on\ncognitive/systems/computational-neuroscience (see the discussion in\n section 7 above),\n interest in neurobiology\u2019s cellular/molecular mainstream\nappears to be increasing. One notable paper is Ann-Sophie Barwich and\nKarim Bschir\u2019s (2017) historical-cum-philosophical study of\nG-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Work on the structure and\nfunctional significance of these proteins has dominated molecular\nneuroscience for the past forty years; their role in the mechanisms of\na variety of cognitive functions is now empirically documented beyond\nquestion. And yet one finds little interest in, or even notice of this\nshift in mainstream neuroscience among philosophers. Barwich and\nBschir\u2019s yeoman history research on the discovery and\ndevelopment of these objects pays off philosophically. The role of\nmanipulability as a criterion for entity realism in the\nscience-in-practice of wet-lab research becomes meaningful \u201conly\nonce scientists have decided how to conceptually coordinate measurable\neffects distinctly to a scientific object\u201d (2017: 1317).\nScientific objects like GPCRs get assigned varying degrees of reality\nthroughout different stages of the discovery process. Such an\nobject\u2019s role in evaluating the reality of \u201cneighboring\nelements of enquiry\u201d becomes a part of the criteria of its\nreality as well.\n\nThe impact of science-in-practice on philosophy of science generally\nhas been felt acutely in the philosophy of neuroscience, most notably\nin increased philosophical interest in neuroscientific\nexperimentation. In itself this should not surprise. Neuroscience\nrelies heavily on laboratory experimentation, especially within its\ncellular and molecular, \u201cSociety for Neuroscience\u201d\nmainstream. So the call to understand experiment should beckon any\nphilosopher who ventures into neuroscience\u2019s cellular/molecular\nfoundations. Two papers by Jacqueline Sullivan (2009, 2010) have been\nimportant in this new emphasis. In her (2009) Sullivan acknowledges\nboth Bickle\u2019s (2003) and Craver\u2019s (2007) focus on cellular\nand molecular mechanisms of long-term potentiation, and\nexperience-driven form of synaptic plasticity. But she insists that\nbroader philosophical commitments, which lead Bickle to ruthless\nreductionist and Craver to mosaic unity \u201cglobal\u201d accounts,\nobscure important aspects of real laboratory neuroscience practice.\nShe emphasizes the role of \u201csubprotocols\u201d, which specify\nhow data are to be gathered, in her model of \u201cthe experimental\nprocess\u201d, and illustrates these notions with a number of\nexamples. Her analysis reveals an important underappreciated tension\namong a pair of widely-accepted experiment norms. Pursuing\n\u201creliability\u201d drives experimenters more deeply into\nextensive laboratory controls. Pursuing \u201cexternal\nvalidity\u201d drives them toward enriched experimental environments\nthat more closely represent the messy natural environment beyond the\nlaboratory. These two norms commonly conflict: in order to get more of\none, scientists introduce conditions that give them less of the other.\n\n\nIn her (2010) Sullivan offers a detailed history of the Morris water\nmaze task, tracing her account back to Morris\u2019s original\npublications. Philosophers of neuroscience have uncritically assumed\nthat the water maze is a widely-accepted neuroscience protocol for\nrodent spatial learning and memory, but the detailed scientific\nhistory is not so clear on this interpretation. Scientific commentary\nover time on what this task measures, including some from Morris\nhimself, reveals no clear consensus. Sullivan traces the source of\nthis scientific inconsistency back to the impact of 1980s-era\ncellular-molecular reductionism driving experimental behavioral\nneurobiology protocols like the Morris water maze.\n\nA different motivation drives neurobiologist Alcino Silva,\nneuroinformaticist Anthony Landreth, and philosopher of neuroscience\nJohn Bickle\u2019s (2014) focus on experimentation. All contemporary\nsciences are growing at a vertiginous pace; but perhaps none more so\nthan neuroscience. It is no longer possible for any single scientist\nto keep up with all the relevant published literature in even his or\nher narrow research field, or fully to comprehend its implications. An\noverall lack of clarity and consensus about what is known, what\nremains doubtful, and what has been disproven creates special problems\nfor experiment planning. There is a recognized and urgent need to\ndevelop strategies and tools to address these problems. Toward this\nexplicit end, Silva, Landreth, and Bickle\u2019s book describes a\nframework and a set of principles for organizing the published record.\nThey derive their framework and principles directly from landmark case\nstudies from the influential neuroscientific field of molecular and\ncellular cognition (MCC), and describe how their framework can be used\nto generate maps of experimental findings. Scientists armed with these\nresearch maps can then determine more efficiently what has been\naccomplished in their fields, and where the knowledge gaps still\nreside. The technology needed to automate the generation of these maps\nalready exists. Silva, Landreth, and Bickle sketch the transformative,\nrevolutionary impact these maps can have on current science.\n\nThree goals motivate Silva, Landreth, and Bickle\u2019s approach.\nFirst, they derive their framework from the cellular and molecular\nneurobiology of learning and memory. This choice was due strictly to\nfamiliarity with the science. Silva was instrumental in bringing gene\ntargeting techniques applied to mammals into behavioral neuroscience,\nand Bickle\u2019s focus on ruthlessly reductive neuroscience was\nbuilt on these and other experimental results. And while each of their\nframework\u2019s different kinds of experiments and evidence have\nbeen recognized by others, theirs purports to be the first to\nsystematize this information explicitly toward the goal of\nfacilitating experimental planning by practicing scientists. Silva,\nLandreth and Bickle insist that important new experiments can be\nidentified and planned by methodically filling in the different forms\nof evidence recognized by their framework, and applying the different\nforms of experiments to the gaps in the experimental record revealed\nby this process.\n\nSecond, Silva, Landreth, and Bickle take head-on the problem of the\ngrowing amount, complexity and integration of the published literature\nfor experiment planning. They show how graphic weighted\nrepresentations of research findings can be used to guide research\ndecisions; and how to construct these. The principles for constructing\nthese maps are the principles for integrating experimental results,\nderived directly from landmark published MCC research. Using a case\nstudy from recent molecular neuroscience, they show how to generate\nsmall maps that reflect a series of experiments, and how to combine\nthese small maps to illustrate an entire field of neuroscience\nresearch.\n\nFinally, Silva, Landreth and Bickle begin to develop a science of\nexperiment planning. They envision the causal graphs that compose\ntheir research maps to play a role similar to that played by\nstatistics in the already-developed science of data analysis. Such a\nresource could have profound implications for further developing\ncitation indices and other impact measures for evaluating\ncontributions to a field, from those of individual scientists to those\nof entire institutions.\n\nMore recently Bickle and Kostko (2018) have extended Silva, Landreth\nand Bickle\u2019s framework beyond the neurobiology of learning and\nmemory. Their case study comes from developmental and social\nneuroscience, Michael Meaney and Moshe Szyf\u2019s work on the\nepigenetics of rodent maternal nursing behaviors on offspring stress\nresponses. Using the details of this case study they elaborate on a\nnotion that Silva, Landreth and Bickle leave underdeveloped, that of\nexperiments designed explicitly for their results, if successful, to\nbe integrated directly into an already-existing background of\nestablished results. And they argue that such experiments\n\u201cintegratable by design\u201d with others are aimed not at\nestablishing evidence for individual causal relations among\nneuroscientific kinds, but rather at formulating entire causal\npathways connecting multiple phenomena. Their emphasis on causal paths\nrelates to that of Lauren Ross (forthcoming). Ross\u2019s work is\nespecially interesting in this context because she uses her causal\npathway concept to address \u201ccausal selection\u201d, which has\nto do with distinguishing between background conditions and\n\u201ctrue\u201d (triggering) causes of some outcome of interest.\nFor Silva, Landreth, and Bickle (2014), accounting for this\ndistinction is likewise crucial, and they rely on a specific kind of\nconnection experiment, \u201cpositive manipulations\u201d, to draw\nit. Bickle and Kostko\u2019s appeal to causal paths in a detailed\ncase study from recent developmental neurobiology might help bridge\nSilva, Landreth and Bickle\u2019s broader work on neurobiological\nexperimentation with Ross\u2019s work drawn from biology more\ngenerally.\n",
