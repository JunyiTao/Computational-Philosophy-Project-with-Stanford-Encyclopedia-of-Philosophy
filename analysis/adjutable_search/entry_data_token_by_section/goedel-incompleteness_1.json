    "main_text": "Introduction || Some Formalized Theories\n1.2 Some Formalized Theories\n\nThe existence of incomplete theories is hardly surprising. Take any\ntheory, even a complete one (see below for examples), and drop some\naxiom; unless the axiom is redundant, the resulting system is\nincomplete. The incompleteness theorems, however, deal with a much\nmore radical kind of incompleteness phenomenon. Unlike the above sort\nof trivially incomplete theories, which can be easily completed, there\nis no way of completing the relevant theories; all their extensions,\ninasmuch as they are still formal systems and hence axiomatizable, are\nalso incomplete. They remain, so to speak, eternally incomplete and\ncan never be completed. They are \u201cessentially incomplete\u201d.\n\n\nIn the first and loose statements of the incompleteness theorems given\nabove, the vague requirement that \u201ca certain amount of\nelementary arithmetic can be carried out\u201d occurred. It is time\nto make this more precise.\n1.2.1 Arithmetical Theories\n\nThe weakest standard system of arithmetic that is usually considered\nin connection with incompleteness and undecidability is so-called\nRobinson arithmetic (due to Raphael M. Robinson; see Tarski, Mostowski\nand Robinson 1953), standardly denoted as Q. As\naxioms, it has the following seven assumptions:\n\n\\(\\neg(0 = x')\\)\n\\(x' = y' \\rightarrow x = y\\)\n\\(\\neg(x = 0) \\rightarrow \\exists y(x = y')\\)\n\\(x + 0 = x\\)\n\\(x + y' = (x + y)'\\)\n\\(x \\times 0 = 0\\)\n\\(x \\times y' = (x \\times y) + x\\)\n\n\nThe intended interpretation of\n\u201c\\(x'\\)\u201d is the successor\nfunction, and obviously, of + and \\(\\times\\), the addition and the\nmultiplication functions, respectively. \u201c0\u201d is the only\nconstant and denotes the number zero.\n\nAdding to these elementary axioms the axiom scheme of induction:\n\n\\[\\tag{IND}\n\\phi(0) \\wedge \\forall x[\\phi(x) \\rightarrow \\phi(x')] \\rightarrow \\forall x\\phi(x),\n\\]\n\n\nresults in (first order) Peano Arithmetic (PA). Note\nthat unlike Q, PA contains\ninfinitely many axioms, because all (infinitely many) instances of the\ninduction scheme, one corresponding to every formula \\(\\phi(x)\\)\n(with at least one free variable) of the language, are taken as\naxioms. But it is a routine mechanical task to check whether a given\nsentence is an instance of this scheme. PA is\ngenerally taken as the standard first-order system of arithmetic.\n\nAnother natural and much-studied arithmetical system, which lies\nbetween Q and PA in strength, is\nPrimitive Recursive Arithmetic (PRA). It contains not\njust the above axioms of Q governing successor,\naddition and multiplication, but also defining axioms for all\nprimitive recursive functions (see the entry on\n recursive functions),\n and the application of the induction scheme is restricted to\nquantifier-free formulas (i.e., \\(\\phi(x)\\) is not allowed to\ncontain any (unbounded) quantifiers).\n\nHowever, essentially the same system is obtained if one takes just the\naxioms of Q and the induction scheme restricted to,\nroughly, purely existential formulas (in technical terms,\n \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-formulas;\nsee below) (this was\nfirst showed by Parsons 1970). Moreover, \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-induction\ncan be shown (Paris and Kirby 1978) to be equivalent to the induction\nscheme restricted to (roughly) purely universal formulas \\((\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-formulas).\nPRA\ncan also be formulated as a \u201clogic-free\u201d equational\ncalculus. PRA, or something equivalent to it, is\nsufficient for developing the theory of syntax for formalized\ntheories. It is often taken as the unproblematic background theory in\nwhich various other systems, whose legitimacy may be more\ncontroversial, are studied.\n\nA much stronger system than PA, important in the\nfoundations of mathematics, which will be mentioned now and then\nbelow, is second-order arithmetic PA\\(^2\\)\n(also often denoted by Z\\(_2\\)). It is more\nthan sufficient for developing all ordinary analysis and algebra. Its\nlanguage is a two-sorted first-order language (see the entry on\n second-order and higher-order logic),\n i.e., it contains two sorts of variables, number variables\n\\(x_1,x_2,\\ldots\\) (or \\(x, y, z, \\ldots\\)) and property variables \\(X_1,\nX_2,\\ldots\\) (or \\(X, Y, Z,\\ldots)\\), where properties are extensionally conceived.\nAs axioms it includes, in addition to the basic axioms of\nPA, all instances of the second-order comprehension\nscheme:\n\n\\[\n\\exists X\\forall x[Xx \\leftrightarrow \\phi(x)]\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\phi(x)\\) can be any formula of the language of\nPA\\(^2\\) in which \\(X\\) doesn\u2019t occur\nfree. (It should be mentioned that PA\\(^2\\) can\nalso be formulated by adding the primitive notion of \nset membership \\((\\in)\\) to the language, regarding the variables\n\\(X, Y, Z,\\ldots\\), as explicitly ranging\nover sets, and reformulating second-order comprehension as\n\\(\\exists X\\forall x[x \\in X \\leftrightarrow \\phi(x)\\)].)\n\nPA\\(^2\\) is a very strong theory. Via the\nmethod of interpretations (see below), one can show that it is\nproof-theoretically as strong as the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory\nZFC without the power-set axiom, call it\nZFC\u2013Pow (whereas the standard, first-order\nPA is similarly proof-theoretically equivalent to\nZFC without the axiom of infinity,\nZFC\u2013Inf). (Cf. the section on the axioms of ZFC\nin the entry on\n set theory.)\n\nObviously, it is assumed that our formal systems are also equipped\nwith a system of rules of inferences (and possibly some logical\naxioms), usually some standard system of classical logic (though the\nincompleteness theorems do not essentially presuppose classical logic,\nbut also apply to systems with, e.g., intuitionistic logic). The above\nstandard systems all come with classical logic. The standard notation\n\\(F \\vdash A\\) is used to express (in the meta-level) that\n\\(A\\) is derivable in \\(F\\), that is, that there is a proof of\n\\(A\\) in \\(F\\), or, in other words, that \\(A\\) is a\ntheorem of \\(F\\). Accordingly, \\(F \\not\\vdash A\\)\nmeans that \\(A\\) is not derivable in \\(F\\).\n\nTo summarize: when it is said, in the context of the incompleteness\ntheorems, that \u201ca certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be\ncarried out\u201d in a system, this usually means that it contains\nPRA or at least Q. For the first\nincompleteness theorem, Q is sufficient; for the\nstandard proofs of the second theorem, something like\nPRA, at a minimum, is needed. There is a version of\nthe second incompleteness theorem for Q (see\nBezboruah & Shepherdson 1976) but there has been some debate on\nwhether the relevant statement in Q can really be\ntaken to express consistency, Q being so weak (see\nKreisel 1958; Bezboruah & Shepherdson 1976; Pudl\u00e1k 1996;\nFranks 2009).\n1.2.2 Theories not Formulated in the Language of Arithmetic\n\nOf course, there are many important and interesting theories in\nmathematics which are not even formulated in the language of\narithmetic. However, the applicability of the incompleteness theorems\ncan be dramatically extended outside the language of first-order\narithmetic and its extensions, when it is noted that all that is\nneeded is that weak theories such as Q, or\nPRA, can be interpreted in the system in\nquestion. Most importantly, this involves various systems of set\ntheory. For example, the incompleteness theorems hold for\nZFC\u2013Inf (i.e., ZFC without the\naxiom of infinity) and all its extensions, however strong (as long as\nthey are axiomatizable.)\n\nRoughly, a theory \\(T_1\\) is interpretable in another\ntheory \\(T_2\\) if the primitive concepts and the range of\nthe variables of \\(T_1\\) are definable in\n\\(T_2\\) so that it is possible to translate every theorem\nof \\(T_1\\) into a theorem of \\(T_2\\). One\nshould not misunderstand such interpretations as providing anything\nlike intuitive synonymity. Two theories may have radically different\nintended subject matter and yet, as formal systems, one may be\ninterpretable in another. (As an illustration: a simple theory of\nancestors may be, taken as a formal system, interpreted in arithmetic;\nobviously this does not mean that grandmothers and such are really\nnumbers.) What is significant is that interpretability preserves\ncertain elementary formal properties of theories, most\nimportantly, consistency: if \\(T_1\\) is interpretable in\n\\(T_2\\) and \\(T_2\\) is consistent,\n\\(T_1\\) is also consistent. And any system in which\nQ can be interpreted is guaranteed to be essentially\nincomplete. For any such theory in which Q is\ninterpretable, the incompleteness could be proved also directly; for\nexample, in various theories of set theory, one can code formulas and\nderivations (instead of numbers) by sets, \u201cG\u00f6del\nsets\u201d, and proceed then as usual (see, e.g., Fitting 2007).\nHowever, for most purposes, it is just much simpler to establish the\ninterpretability of Q in the theory at issue.\n\nIn sum, when it is said that \u201ca certain amount of elementary\narithmetic can be carried out within a system\u201d, what is meant is\neither that the system is an axiomatizable extension of\nQ, or that Q can be interpreted in\nit. (In the case of (the standard proofs of) the second incompleteness\ntheorem, substitute PRA for Q.)\n1.2.3 Some Exceptions: Complete Theories\n\nOn the other hand, not all theories of arithmetic are incomplete. The\ntheory of only addition of natural numbers but without multiplication\n(often called \u201cPresburger arithmetic\u201d), for example, is\ncomplete (and decidable) (Presburger 1929), as is the theory of\nmultiplication of the positive integers (Skolem 1930). These theories\nare, though, very weak. But in any case, at least a theory which deals\nwith both addition and multiplication is needed. More interestingly,\nthe natural first-order theory of arithmetic of real numbers\n(with both addition and multiplication), the so-called theory of real\nclosed fields \\((\\mathbf{RCF})\\), is both complete and decidable,\nas was shown by Tarski (1948); he also demonstrated that the\nfirst-order theory of Euclidean geometry is complete and decidable.\nThus, one should keep in mind that there are some non-trivial and\ninteresting theories to which G\u00f6del\u2019s theorems do not\napply.\n",
