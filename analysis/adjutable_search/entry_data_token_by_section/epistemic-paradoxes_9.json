    "main_text": "Anti-expertise || The \u201cKnowability Paradox\u201d\n5.2 The \u201cKnowability Paradox\u201d\n\nFrederic Fitch (1963) reports that in 1945 he first learned of this\nproof of unknowable truths from a referee report on a manuscript he\nnever published. Thanks to Joe Salerno\u2019s (2009) archival\nresearch, we now know that referee was Alonzo Church.\n\nAssume there is a true sentence of the form \u2018\\(p\\)\nbut \\(p\\) is not known\u2019.\nAlthough this sentence is consistent, modest principles of epistemic\nlogic imply that sentences of this form are unknowable.\n\n\n\n1.\n\\(K(p \\amp{\\sim}Kp)\\)\n(Assumption) \n\n2.\n\\(Kp \\amp K{\\sim}Kp\\)\n1, Knowledge distributes over conjunction \n\n3.\n\\({\\sim}Kp\\)\n2, Knowledge implies truth (from the second conjunct) \n\n4.\n\\(Kp \\amp{\\sim}Kp\\)\n2, 3 by conjunction elimination of the first conjunct and then\nconjunction introduction \n\n5.\n\\({\\sim}K(p \\amp{\\sim}Kp)\\)\n1, 4 Reductio ad absurdum  \n\n\nSince all the assumptions are discharged, the conclusion is a\nnecessary truth. So it is a necessary truth that \\(p \\amp{\\sim}Kp\\) is\nnot known. In other words, \\(p \\amp{\\sim}Kp\\) is unknowable.\n\nThe cautious draw a conditional moral: If there are actual unknown\ntruths, there are unknowable truths. After all, some philosophers will\nreject the antecedent because they believe there is an omniscient\nbeing.\n\nBut secular idealists and logical positivists concede that there are\nsome actual unknown truths. How can they continue to believe that all\ntruths are knowable? Astonishingly, these eminent philosophers seem\nrefuted by the pinch of epistemic logic we have just seen. Also\ninjured are those who limit their claims of universal knowability to a\nlimited domain. For instance, Immanuel Kant (A223/B272) asserts that\nall empirical propositions are knowable. This pocket of optimism would\nbe enough to ignite the contradiction (Stephenson 2015).\n\nTimothy Williamson doubts that this casualty list is enough for the\nresult to qualify as a paradox:\n\nThe conclusion that there are unknowable truths is an affront to\nvarious philosophical theories, but not to common sense. If proponents\n(and opponents) of those theories long overlooked a simple\ncounterexample, that is an embarrassment, not a paradox. (2000, 271)\n\n\nThose who believe that the Church-Fitch result is a genuine paradox\ncan respond to Williamson with paradoxes that accord with common sense\n(and science \u2013and religious orthodoxy). For instance, common\nsense heartily agrees with the conclusion that something exists. But\nit is surprising that this can be proved without empirical premises.\nSince the quantifiers of standard logic (first order predicate logic\nwith identity) have existential import, the logician can deduce that\nsomething exists from the principle that everything is identical to\nitself. Most philosophers balk at this simple proof because they feel\nthat the existence of something cannot be proved by sheer logic. They\nare not balking at the statement that is in accord in common sense\n(that something exists). They are only balking at the statement that\nit can be proved by sheer logic. Likewise, many philosophers who agree\nthat there are unknowables balk solely on the grounds that such a\nprofound result cannot be obtained from such limited means.\n",
