    "main_text": "\n\nPaul Gerhard Natorp was one of the most prominent philosophers in\nGermany at the turn of the last century. Born in D\u00fcsseldorf on\nJanuary 24, 1854, he began his university education at Bonn in\nclassical philology under Hermann Usener, and continued at the\nUniversity of Strassburg, but as he neared completion of his studies,\nhe found himself unsatisfied with his work, and vexed by \u201ca\nsecret philosophical urge\u201d (Natorp 1921f: 152\u2013153; all\ntranslations by the author). It found its outlet when a friend\nstudying at Marburg wrote to him of Hermann Cohen and F.A. Lange, and\nof their interpretation of Kant; thenceforth Natorp \u201cplaced his\nwhole thinking and his entire, powerful capacity for work in the\nservice of this single task:\u201d the development of\n\u201cphilosophy as science\u201d (Cassirer 1925: 276). His first\nphilosophy teacher was Ernst Laas, whose anti-Kantian and\nanti-Platonic positivism incited Natorp to deeper engagement with the\nphilosophy of critique (Natorp 1921f: 153). In this way, his early\nphilosophical studies converged with his original love of philology as\nhe pursued the \u201cprehistory\u201d of Kantian critique in\nDescartes, Galileo, and Copernicus, back to Plato (Natorp 1921f: 154).\nNatorp completed his Habilitation under Cohen at Marburg in\n1881, and taught there until his death on August 17, 1924.\n\nDuring his long and prolific tenure at Marburg, Natorp came into\ncontact with a number of illustrious scholars and writers. Boris\nPasternak, Karl Barth, and Ernst Cassirer were among his students;\nRabindranath Tagore was his friend. In the fateful summer of 1914 the\nyoung T.S. Eliot caricatured Natorp, the director of the summer\nprogram in which he was enrolled\n [image available online].\n In addition to Cohen, academic colleagues included the philosopher\nNicolai Hartmann, the theologians Rudolf Bultmann and Rudolf Otto, and\nthe literary scholar Ernst Robert Curtius. Late in life, Natorp\ndirected Hans-Georg Gadamer\u2019s doctoral dissertation (Gadamer\n1922), and, together with his long-time philosophical interlocutor,\nEdmund Husserl of Freiburg, engineered Martin Heidegger\u2019s\nappointment as an Extraordinarius at Marburg in 1923. Upon\nNatorp\u2019s death the following summer (see Heidegger 1992),\nHeidegger assumed his chair, thus bringing the department\u2019s\nKantian orientation to a decisive close. \n\nLike his younger contemporary, Ernst Cassirer, Natorp initially\nfocused on the explication, defense, and elaboration of Cohen\u2019s\ndifficult and often impenetrable work on Kant-interpretation, the\ntheory of science, and the history of\n philosophy.[1]\n While Natorp published important works of contemporary systematic\nphilosophy (1887, 1888h), he devoted much of his attention in the last\ndecades of the nineteenth century to filling out historical elements\nin Cohen\u2019s larger framework. He especially employed his\nexpertise in Greek thought to work out ancient anticipations of\n\u201ccritical\u201d scientific philosophy, and analyze its natural\ndevelopment. Later, in the chaotic social, political, and cultural\nlandscape of pre- and interwar Germany, and especially in the wake of\nCohen\u2019s death in 1918, Natorp departed from the classic Marburg\nconcentration on the logic of the exact sciences. This departure was\nless a shift in his basic philosophical outlook than the sounding of\nnew themes, some native to the Marburg School, others arising out of\ndialogue with other philosophers. Motivated by the liberal-socialist\n ideals[2]\n integral to the global theory of culture that was the\nMarburgers\u2019 ultimate\n aim,[3]\n Natorp wrote widely on ethics, politics, and\n Sozialp\u00e4dagogik.[4]\n On the other hand, one must also interpret Natorp\u2019s later\nthought (esp. his \u201contological turn\u201d; von Wolzogen, 1988; Brach 1996) in light of his\ndialogue with other philosophies challenging neo-Kantianism\u2019s\ndominance in the German academy, notably the so-called\nLebensphilosophie, and the phenomenologies of Husserl and\n Heidegger.[5]\n\n",
