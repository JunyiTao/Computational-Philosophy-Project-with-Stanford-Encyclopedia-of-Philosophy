    "main_text": "Religious Minimalism\n4. Religious Minimalism\n\nMinimalist accounts of religious language, which are\u2014rightly or\nwrongly\u2014closely associated with Wittgenstein, agree with (a*)\nand (b*) but take issue with the face value understanding of\ndescriptiveness along with associated ideas of fact, representation,\nreference and truth. For convenience, let us call these\nrealism-relevant concepts. The opposition involves two main\nideas. First, rather than posit a demanding standard that a field of\ndiscourse must meet to count as genuinely descriptive, minimalists\npropose that a discourse that satisfies very modest\nconditions\u2014for example, that it possesses a truth predicate and\nstandards of justification for what is affirmed or rejected\u2014is\nthereby descriptive. Second, realism-relevant concepts are taken to be\nat least partly constituted by features of the discourse (or\n\u201clanguage game\u201d) in which they are used. Minimalists\nthereby reject a uniform account of descriptiveness across different\nareas of discourse. Descriptiveness, reference, truth, and so on are\nlanguage-game-internal concepts: they are constituted\ndifferently in different areas of discourse.\n 4.1\n will consider minimalist accounts of religious discourse and\n 4.2\n will look at whether Wittgenstein might plausibly be understood as\nsharing this approach.\n\nThe discussion in this section touches on issues that have been\nexplored in detail outside of the philosophy of religion. For more on\nthe wider philosophical background see Stoljar & Damnjanovic 2014\non deflationary and Pedersen & Wright 2013 and 2016 on pluralist\naccounts of truth.\n",
