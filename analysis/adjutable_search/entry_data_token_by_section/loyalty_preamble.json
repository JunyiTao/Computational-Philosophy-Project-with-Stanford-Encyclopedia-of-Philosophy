    "main_text": "\n\nLoyalty is usually seen as a virtue, albeit a problematic one. It is\nconstituted centrally by perseverance in an association to which a\nperson has become intrinsically committed as a matter of his or her\nidentity. Its paradigmatic expression is found in close friendship, to\nwhich loyalty is integral, but many other relationships and\nassociations seek to encourage it as an aspect of affiliation or\nmembership: families expect it, organizations often demand it, and\ncountries do what they can to foster it. May one also have loyalty to\nprinciples or other abstractions? Derivatively, two key issues in the\ndiscussion of loyalty concern its status as a virtue and, if that\nstatus is granted, the limits to which loyalty ought to be\nsubject.\n",
