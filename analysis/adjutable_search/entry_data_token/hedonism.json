Psychological or motivational hedonism claims\nthat only pleasure or pain motivates us. Ethical or evaluative hedonism\nclaims that only pleasure has worth or value and only pain or\ndispleasure has disvalue or the opposite of worth. Jeremy Bentham\nasserted both psychological and ethical hedonism with the first two\nsentences of his book An Introduction to the Principles of Morals\nand Legislation: \u201cNature has placed mankind under the\ngovernance of two sovereign masters, pain, and\npleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to\ndo, as well as to determine what we shall do\u201d. Debate about\nhedonism was a feature too of many centuries before Bentham, and this\nhas also continued after him. Other key contributors to debate over\nhedonism include Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Aquinas, Butler, Hume,\nMill, Nietzsche, Brentano, Sidgwick, Moore, Ross, Broad, Ryle and\nChisholm.\n\n\nIn general, pleasure is understood broadly below, as including or as\nincluded in all pleasant feeling or experience: contentment, delight,\necstasy, elation, enjoyment, euphoria, exhilaration, exultation,\ngladness, gratification, gratitude, joy, liking, love, relief,\nsatisfaction, Schadenfreude, tranquility, and so on. Pain or displeasure\ntoo is understood broadly below, as including or as included in all\nunpleasant experience or feeling: ache, agitation, agony, angst,\nanguish, annoyance, anxiety, apprehensiveness, boredom, chagrin,\ndejection, depression, desolation, despair, desperation, despondency,\ndiscomfort, discombobulation, discontentment, disgruntlement, disgust,\ndislike, dismay, disorientation, dissatisfaction, distress, dread,\nenmity, ennui, fear, gloominess, grief, guilt, hatred, horror, hurting,\nirritation, loathing, melancholia, nausea, queasiness, remorse,\nresentment, sadness, shame, sorrow, suffering, sullenness, throb,\nterror, unease, vexation, and so on. \u2018Pain or displeasure\u2019\nis usually stated below just as \u2018pain\u2019 or just as\n\u2018displeasure\u2019. Further economy is sometimes secured by\nstating, just about pleasure or just about displeasure, points that do\nor might apply to both. Whether such pleasure-displeasure parallels\nactually hold is a significant further issue, touched upon only briefly\nin the present entry.\n\n\nWhat sort of entity is pleasure or pain? Candidates include: state,\nstate of affairs, thing, event and property. Second, is it a\nfirst-order entity or a higher-order entity? For example, is your pain\nyour toothache, its naggingness, or both? When you enjoy the cityscape\nbelow your viewpoint, is your pleasure your view, your enjoyment of it,\nthe pleasurableness of your enjoyment of it, or all three? And so on.\nThird, does pleasure essentially have a \u2018feel\u2019 or\nphenomenology, a \u2018something it is like\u2019 (Nagel 1974).\nFourth, does it essentially have directedness or\n\u2018aboutness\u2019 or intentionality? These issues about the\nnature of pleasure and displeasure are discussed below (see also the\nentry for\n pleasure)\n as they bear on the\nnature and merits of various forms of hedonism.\n", "toc": [{"#PsyHed": "1.

Psychological Hedonism\n\n\nBentham's claim that pain and pleasure determine what we do\nmakes him a psychological hedonist, and more specifically a hedonist\nabout the determination of action. This section focuses instead on the\nmore modest claim that only pleasure or displeasure motivates us. This\nform of psychological hedonism helpfully allows that some hedonic\nmotivations of ours fail to determine our action, and that some of our\nhedonically determined actions fail actually to get us pleasure.\nWeakness of agency can see our motivation fail to generate our action\n(see\n weakness of will);\n and the related\n\u2018paradox of hedonism\u2019 is the plausible claim that some of\nour hedonically motivated or determined action actually secures less\npleasure than we would otherwise have got (e.g., Sidgwick: 48f).\n1.1 Arguments For Psychological Hedonism\n\n\nWhy believe even the relatively modest motivational form of\npsychological hedonism? One argument infers it from the motivational\negoist claim that each of us is always motivated to maximize what we\ntake to be our own good, plus the claim that we each accept that our\ngood is our maximal or sufficient balance of pleasure over displeasure.\nBut motivational egoism is at best controversial (see entry on\n egoism).\n Also controversial is the psychological\nthesis that each of us accepts hedonism about our own good. For one\nthing, it ungenerously implies that those who think they reject\nhedonism about their own good do not even know their own minds on this\nmatter.\n\n\nAnother argument for motivational hedonism is this: sometimes we are\nmotivated by pleasure, every case can be accounted for in this\nway, the more unified the account the better, and hedonism is the most\nunified account. But at most, this argument shows only that in the\nunification respect hedonism is the best account of our motivation.\nEven if that is so, unification is not the only feature that it is\ndesirable for theories of motivation to have, and the argument is\nsilent on how motivational hedonism scores on any other desirable\nfeature. The argument consequently fails to establish the overall\nplausibility of motivational hedonism, let alone the thesis that it is\nthe most plausible theory of motivation. In addition, parallel\narguments arguably \u2018show\u2019 that we are sometimes motivated\nto improve ourselves, to survive, to attend to our near-and-dear, to\nlive with integrity, and so forth; that every case can be narrated in\nsuch terms; and thus that all these rival views are just as unified as\nis motivational hedonism.\n\n\nA third argument for motivational hedonism claims that it is a truth\nof everyday meaning that the words \u2018is motivated\u2019 just mean\nsome such thing as \u2018aims for the greatest balance of pleasure\nover pain\u2019. The core trouble here is that motivational hedonism\nis not a truth of everyday meaning. Even if it were such a truth, the\nmain issue of substance would remain. Rivals would simply re-state the\nongoing central issue using neighbouring concepts; for example:\n\u2018however it might be with the narrower concept\n\u201cmotive\u201d, the claim that we are always moved by\npleasure is false\u2019. Nor would it help motivational hedonists to\nmake a Humpty Dumpty move here (see Carroll: ch. 6): \u2018when\nI use the words \u201cis motivated\u201d, said Humpty\nDumpty, they mean just what I choose them to mean, namely\n\u201cis aimed at pleasure\u201d\u2019. Such stipulation does not\nidentify any good reason for anyone to join Humpty Dumpty in his\neccentric word usage.\n\n\nEven if all of the above arguments for motivational hedonism fail,\nother arguments for it could be made. Even if every argument for\nmotivational hedonism fails, failure of a positive is not success of a\nnegative. What then of the arguments against this relatively modest\nform of psychological hedonism?\n1.2 Arguments Against Psychological Hedonism\n\n\nSome challenges to motivational hedonism are demands for its thesis\nto be made more determinate. First, is it about every motivation; or is\nit only about the motives of ours that predominate, with exceptions\nwhen little pleasure or displeasure is at stake and/or when much else\nis at stake (c.f. Kavka: 64\u201380 on \u2018predominant egoism\u2019)?\nThe present entry takes motivational hedonism to be the first of these\nviews. Second, is it about all motivational entities, including all\ndesires, wants, preferences, inclinations, intentions, decisions, and\nchoices; or is it instead a claim about only an incomplete subset of\nthese? The present entry treats it as a claim just about desires (see\nthe entries on\n desire\n and\n intention).\n Third and relatedly, is it a pair of\nclaims, one about desires for pleasure and the other about aversions to\ndispleasure; or is it instead a single claim about overall or net\ndesires for a sufficient or maximal net pleasure-displeasure balance?\nThe present entry generally treats it as the latter. Fourth, is it a\nclaim about every desire whatever, or just a claim about every human\ndesire? The present entry treats it as the latter, though it is a good\nquestion why human desirers might be thought to be specially\npleasure-oriented. Fifth, is it the egoistic claim that one desires\nonly one's own pleasure, or the egocentric claim that one desires\nonly the pleasure of oneself and one's near-and-dear, or is it\ninstead a non-egoistic claim? When it makes a difference, the present\nentry takes motivational hedonism to be the first of these claims.\nSixth, is it the production-based claim that we are motivated to cause\npleasure, or does it allow, for example, that being moved to laugh\nmight be being motivated to express rather than to produce pleasure?\nThe present entry considers production-based claims, plus the distinct\nidea that our desire only ever has pleasure as its object.\n\n\nFrom critical demands for more determinacy, turn now to the\nfollowing articulated \u2018incredulous stare\u2019 (after Lewis: 86)\nchallenge to motivational hedonism. We direct our richly various mental\nlives \u2013 our beliefs, musings, intentions, enthusiasms, hopes,\naspirations, and so on and on \u2013 at massively plural and diverse\nitems in ourselves, in others, in myriad aspects of the non-human\nworld, and in the infinities of contingent future possibility. In\nkeeping with this overall psychological picture, our motivations too\nhave objects that are massively plural and diverse. In the light of\nsuch facts, motivational hedonism merits an incredulous stare: why\nwould anyone believe even for a minute that all human motivation takes\nas its object just one sort of item? On this point, some go beyond\nincredulity to contempt. Thus Nietzsche: \u201cMan does not strive for\npleasure; only the Englishman does\u201d (Nietzsche: \u2018Maxims and\nArrows\u2019 #12). Perhaps the most promising motivational hedonist\nresponse, about all humans including Englishmen, is to say that all our\nbasic motives are directed at pleasure and all our non-basic motives\nare pleasure-centred too, but less directly so. This move is examined\nfurther below in discussion of Butler and Hume.\n\n\nSome other criticisms of motivational hedonism can be quickly\nrebutted. One such criticism is that we are often motivated by things\nthat in fact give us neither pleasure nor the best available\npleasure-displeasure balance, such as when we step under a shower that\nwe take to be suitably warm but find instead to be scalding hot.\nAnother is that the idea of maximal pleasure, or of the best feasible\npleasure-displeasure balance, assumes a common measure that cannot be\nhad. A third criticism is that not every pleasure in prospect motivates\nus. Hedonists can reply: first, that one is always and only motivated\nby what one thinks to be one's maximal or sufficient pleasure or\npleasure-displeasure balance; second, that this is possible even if the\nidea of pleasure maximization in such settings does not ultimately make\nsense; and third, that hedonism does not imply that one is motivated by\nevery pleasure prospect.\n\n\nMotivational hedonism would be seriously undermined by any case of\nan individual who is motivated otherwise than by pleasure or\ndispleasure. Here are some standard candidates that seem true to\nexperience: the parent who seeks to give his child good early years and\na good start in life for that child's sake, the walker who kicks\na small stone \u2018just for the hell of it\u2019, the soldier who\nopts for a painful death for himself to save his comrades, and the\ndying person who fights to keep a grip on life despite fully grasping\nthat much pain and little or no pleasure now remains to her.\n\n\nThe standard style of hedonist response to attempted counterexamples\nis to offer rival motivational stories: the soldier was really\nmotivated only by an underlying belief that her dying would secure her\na joyful afterlife or at least a half-second's sweet pleasure of\nhero's self-sacrifice; the parent was actually motivated only by\nhis own pleasurable intention to give the child a good start or by his\nexpectation that his now having this intention will somehow cause him\nto have pleasure later; the dying non-believer in any afterlife in fact\nhangs on only because she really believes that in her life there is\nstill pleasure for her; and so on.\n\n\nThe capability of hedonists to tell hedonic stories as to our\nmotives does not in itself generate any reason to think such narratives\ntrue. To escape refutation by counterexample, motivational hedonists\nneed to tell the tale of every relevant motive in hedonic terms that\nare not merely imaginative but are also in every case more plausible\nthan the anti-hedonist lessons that our experience seems repeatedly to\nteach some of us about many of our motives.\n\n\nAs noted above, some statements of motivational hedonism are\nindeterminate. Consider now the more precise thesis that each of\none's desires or passions or appetites has one's own\npleasure and only this as its object, as that at which alone it is\naimed or is directed or is about. This thesis was a target of Bishop\nJoseph Butler in his 1729 work Fifteen Sermons Preached at the\nRolls Chapel. Butler noted in his Preface that there are:\n\u201csuch passions in mankind as desire of esteem, or of being\nbeloved, or of knowledge\u201d. All of these have objects other than\npleasure. Drawing on Butler's critique, David Hume added further\nexamples: that people have bodily appetites such as hunger and thirst;\nthat mental passions drive them to attain such things as fame, power,\nand vengeance; and that many of us also: \u201cfeel a desire of\nanother's happiness and good\u201d (Hume: Appendix 2, 12\u201313).\nAll these appetites have objects other than just one's own\npleasure or displeasure. By appeal to such cases Butler and Hume\narguably refuted the strong motivational hedonist thesis that\none's every desire has one's own pleasure and that alone as\nits object.\n\n\nIn pulling things together downstream from the Butler-Hume critique,\nhedonist responses might first distinguish basic from non-basic\ndesires. A desire is basic if one has it independently of any thought\none has about what else this will or might cause or bring about. A\ndesire is non-basic if one's having it does depend on one's\nhaving such further thought. Equipped with this distinction,\nmotivational hedonists can claim that one's every basic desire\nhas one's own pleasure as its object, and one's every\nnon-basic desire depends on one's thinking this will or might\nbring one pleasure. Thus propelled, hedonists can swim back against the\nbroader Butler-Hume stream by claiming, of everyone in every case, that\nhas only non-basic desire for esteem or knowledge or to be beloved, and\nthis only because one thinks it will or might give one pleasure; and\nlikewise with one's appetite for food or drink, one's\nmental passion for fame or power or vengeance, and one's desire\nfor the happiness or good of any other.\n\n\nDespite the implicature of the clich\u00e9, it is possible to sink\neven as one swims. Still, the foregoing does supply hedonists with some\npotential buoyancy aids. They can claim that one's every basic\ndesire is directed at one's own pleasure, and one's every\nnon-basic desire, directed at something other than pleasure, is had\nonly because one thinks this will or might bring one pleasure. The wide\nrange of ways in which one's desire for non-pleasure could bring\none pleasure include: by this desire's itself being an instance\nof pleasure (e.g., by appeal to a desire-pleasure identity thesis; see\nHeathwood), by the desire's having the property of\npleasurableness (e.g., deploying the thought that pleasure is a\nhigher-order property of every desire), by the desire's causing\none pleasure independently of whether its object obtains (e.g., a\nfan's desire to be a vampire or a hobbit might cause him pleasure\neven though this desire of his is never fulfilled); or by the\ndesire's causing its object to obtain, where this object is an\ninstance of one's pleasure, or has pleasure as one of its\nproperties, or causes one pleasure. Well and good. But again, it is one\nthing to tell such motivational hedonist stories and it is another\nthing to identify any reason to think the stories true.\n\n\nA wider issue about motivational hedonism is this: is it a\ncontingent claim about an aspect of our psychology that could have been\notherwise; or does it posit a law of our psychological nature; or is it\na necessary truth about all metaphysically or conceptually or logically\npossible motivations? The answers to such questions also bear on the\nsorts of evidence and argument we need if we are fully to appraise\nmotivational hedonism. If it is an empirical psychological thesis, as\nit seems to be, then it is reasonable to expect application of the\nmethods and evidence of empirical psychology, social inquiry, and\nperhaps also biological science, to do the main work of appraising it.\nIt is also reasonable to expect that most of this work is to be done by\nspecialist scientists and social scientists through their systematic\nconduct of meta-analyses of large numbers of empirical studies.\nPhilosophical work will continue to be needed too, to weed out\nincoherent ideas, to separate out the numerous distinct motivational\nhedonist theses; and to scrutinize whether, and if so with what\nsignificance, various empirical findings actually do bear on these\nvarious hedonist theses. For instance, even the feasibility of a\nresearch design that is capable of empirically separating out our basic\nfrom our non-basic motives would be a serious challenge. Philosophical\nwork can also identify the various features that it is desirable for\ntheories of motivation to have and to be appraised against.\nUnification, determinacy, and confirmation by cases are treated above\nas desirable. Other desirable features might include consistency and\nmaximal scope. Philosophers and others can systematically appraise\ntheories of motivation in such terms, including through pairwise\ncomparative assessments of rival theories in terms of those desirable\nfeatures.\n\n\nThis section has critically reviewed motivational hedonism and has\nfound weaknesses in some central arguments for the view, together with\nsome significant problems of determinacy and disconfirmation. It has\nalso found that there are arguments against motivational hedonism that\nhave some force. Ongoing inquiry is continuing to assess whether such\ntroubles for motivational hedonism can be overcome, and whether any of\nits rivals fare any better overall than it does.\n2. Ethical Hedonism\n\n\nAt its simplest, ethical hedonism is the claim that all and only\npleasure has positive importance and all and only pain or displeasure\nhas negative importance. This importance is to be understood\nnon-instrumentally, that is, independently of the importance of\nanything that pleasure or displeasure might cause or prevent. From\nethical hedonism, it follows that if our relationships, achievements,\nknowledge, character states, and so on, have any non-instrumental\nimportance, this is just a matter of any pleasure or displeasure that\nis in their natures. Otherwise, they have only instrumental importance\nthrough the pleasure they cause or displeasure they diminish. At least\nfrom the simple forms of ethical hedonism, it also follows that\npleasure is good whenever it is had, even in matters that are\nthemselves worthless or worse. Some hedonists are willing to bite such\nbullets; others develop more complex forms of ethical hedonism that\nseek to soften the bullets or even to dissolve them.\n\n\nSome things have both instrumental and non-instrumental importance,\nand in such cases their overall importance is a function of both. These\ntwo matters can also pull in opposite directions. Your pain of being\nonce bitten has non-instrumental negative importance, for example, but\nit might also have instrumental positive importance through the further\npain you avoid by its making you twice shy. Instrumental importance is\na contingent matter and it varies widely from case to case. This is why\nthe non-instrumental claims of pleasure and displeasure are the present\nfocus.\n\n\nEthical hedonism can be universalist, me-and-my-near-and-dear\negocentric, or egoistically focused just on one's own pleasure.\nIt can also be a claim about value, morality, well-being, rationality,\nreasons or aesthetics. It can be a claim about grounds for action,\nbelief, motivation or feeling; or a claim about ought, obligation, good\nand bad, or right and wrong. And these are not the only\npossibilities. The discussion below aims for both determinacy of\nformulation and generality across the different forms of ethical\nhedonism, albeit that these two aims are in some tension with one\nanother. For economy of expression, discussion proceeds below in terms\nof hedonism about value. At its simplest, this is the thesis that\nanything has non-instrumental value if and only if it is an instance of\npleasure, and has non-instrumental disvalue if and only if it is an\ninstance of pain or displeasure.\n2.1 Ethical Hedonism and the Nature of Pleasure\n\n\nAristotle (1095a15\u201322) claimed that we all agree that the good is\neudaimonia but there is disagreement among us about what\neudaimonia is. Similarly, ethical hedonists agree with one\nanother that the good is pleasure, but there is some disagreement among\nthem, and among non-hedonists too, about what pleasure is. Accounts of\npleasure are canvassed below, and issues with them are briefly\nreviewed, especially regarding the various ways in which they bear on\nthe prospects for ethical hedonism.\n\n\nPhenomenalism about pleasure is the thesis that pleasure is a mental\nstate or property that is or that has a certain something that is\n\u2018what it is like\u2019 for its subject; a certain feel, feeling,\nfelt character, tone or phenomenology. On the face of it, the classic\nutilitarians Jeremy Bentham and J.S. Mill were phenomenalists about\npleasure. With various complexities and qualifications, so too are some\nmore recent writers (e.g., Moore: 64, Broad: 229\u201333, Schlick: ch. 2,\nSprigge: ch. 5, T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6: 84\u201384, Crisp 2006: 103\u2013109, Bradley,\nLabukt).\n\n\nIntentionalism about pleasure is the thesis that pleasure is an\nintentional state or property and thus has \u2018directedness\u2019.\nIntentional or representational states or properties are many and\ndiverse, but they share a subject-mode-content structure (Crane: ch.\n1). You or I or the next person might be the subject, belief or\nintention or desire or perception or emotion or pleasure might be the\nintentional mode, and the content of this intentional state or property\nincludes its object or that which it is about. If I delight in the day,\nfor example, I am the subject of this mental state or property that has\ndelight as its intentional mode and the day as its intentional object.\nMy delight in the day is thus an instance of intentional pleasure.\nIntentionalism implies that pleasure is an intentional state or a\nproperty in the pleasure mode that has some object. Brentano\n(1874/1973) was an intentionalist about pleasure, and so too are some\nmore recent philosophers (e.g., Chisholm, Crane, Feldman 2004).\n\n\nIntentionalist accounts of pleasure are less well known than\nphenomenalist accounts, so they merit brief elaboration on several\npoints. First, to say that pleasure is an intentional state or property\nis not to make any claim about deliberateness, choice or intention.\nIntentionalism is the thesis that pleasure has\n\u2018about-ness\u2019, it not a thesis about pleasure's\nrelation to the will. Second, if pleasure is an intentional state or\nproperty then it has an object, but it does not follow that all\npleasures are propositional attitudes, with states of affairs or\npropositions as their objects. On one standard account, any\npsychological verb that can be inserted into the \u03c6 place in the\nschema \u2018S \u03c6s that p\u2019 is an attitude (e.g.,\n\u2018thinks\u2019, \u2018hopes\u2019, \u2018wishes\u2019,\n\u2018prefers\u2019, \u2018delights\u2019, \u2018enjoys\u2019) to\na proposition p. Some accept the universal thesis that all intentional\nstates are propositional attitudes. But this thesis is vulnerable to\ncounterexample from object-directed emotions including personal love\nand hate, the objects of which seem not to be fully specifiable as\nstates of affairs or as propositions. Relatedly, though some\nintentional pleasures are indeed propositional attitudes, it is a\nsignificant further question whether they all are. A third\nclarification is this. If there are intentional pleasures then they are\nsuch that their objects might or might not exist. I could delight in\nthe concert performance of my favourite musician, for example, even if\nthe actual performer is instead just a talented imposter, or even if\nthe \u2018performer\u2019 is in fact just an audio-visual effect of\nclever sound and light projection. Or, to update and to make concrete\nan older and more abstract example from Chisholm (28\u201329), Gore might\nfor a time have enjoyed his victory in the 2000 U.S. presidential\nelection, even though he actually did not win it. These claims about\nintentional pleasures are instances of the wider and admittedly rather\nperplexing point that the objects of some intentional states and\nproperties do not exist (see entry on\n Intentionality).\n\n\nIn various significant ways, issues concerning the phenomenal and\nintentional nature of pleasure bear on hedonism about value. Such\nmatters are canvassed below.\n\n\nIntentionalism about the mental is the thesis that all mental\nmatters are intentional, that they all have directedness or\n\u2018aboutness\u2019 (e.g., Brentano 1874/1973, Crane). Pleasure is a\nmental matter, so intentionalism about pleasure implies that any\npleasure is an intentional matter and thus has an object. Strong\nintentionalism implies that phenomenal character is purely a matter of\nintentional character, and this implies in turn that intentional\ncharacter exhausts phenomenal character. All intentionalist accounts of\npleasure are of course consistent with intentionalism about pleasure.\nBut intentionalism about pleasure is inconsistent with any radical\nphenomenalist account that claims, of some or all pleasure, that it has\nno intentional character. Moderate phenomenalist accounts instead claim\nthat all pleasure is both phenomenal and intentional; so they are\nconsistent with intentionalism, and some are also consistent with\nstrong intentionalism. Some phenomenalist accounts of pleasure are\nneither radical nor moderate; but are instead indeterminate on the\nmatter of whether or not pleasure has any intentional character. Such\nindeterminacy then carries through to any form of hedonism that is\nbuilt on them. Insofar as such indeterminacy is undesirable in any\naccount of pleasure, and in any hedonist thesis, it is a count against\nthese views.\n\n\nPhenomenalism about pleasure is the thesis that all pleasure has\nphenomenal character. Radical intentionalist accounts (e.g., Feldman\n2004: 56, Shafer-Landau: 20) claim, of some or all pleasure, that it\nhas no phenomenal or felt character. Any such account is inconsistent\nwith phenomenalism about pleasure. Though Feldman and Shafer-Landau do\nargue that intentional pleasure need not have any phenomenology or felt\ncharacter, they also argue, respectively, that there is a distinct\n\u2018sensory\u2019 or \u2018physical\u2019 sort of pleasure that\ndoes have felt character. Moderate intentionalist accounts, by\ncontrast, claim that all pleasure is both phenomenal and intentional,\nand this makes them consistent with phenomenalism about pleasure. Most\nintentionalists are mindful that all pleasure has a phenomenal\nreputation, and they attempt to account for this.\n\n\nModerate phenomenalism and moderate intentionalism can be re-framed\nas hybrid accounts that build on the idea that pleasure has both\nphenomenal and intentional character. A strong intentionalist hybrid\nview (e.g., Crane: chs. 1, 3) is that pleasure is a property or state\nthe phenomenal character of which is fully captured in its intentional\ncharacter. On one account of this sort, the phenomenal property or\nstate of my delighting in the day just is my having a state or property\nin the intentional mode of delight, with content that includes\ndirectedness at the day. A different hybrid account is that pleasure is\nan intentional state or property that also has a phenomenal\nhigher-order property. Along these lines, it might be held that delight\nin the day is a state or property in the delight mode that is directed\nat the day, and that in addition has a certain felt character. A third\nhybrid account is that pleasure is an intentional state or property\nthat has a phenomenal object. Along these lines, my delighting in the\nday might be taken to be my intrinsically desiring a certain day-caused\nphenomenal delight-state or delight-property of mine. A fourth hybrid\naccount is that pleasure is a phenomenal state or property that in\naddition meets an object-of-intentional-state condition. For example,\none might regard: \u201cPleasure\u2026 as a feeling which \u2026\nis at least implicitly apprehended as desirable\u2026\u201d\n(Sidgwick: 127; see also Brandt, Sumner: 90). This fourth sort of\nhybrid view is rather demanding, because any subject who lacks the\ncapacity \u2018implicitly to apprehend as desirable\u2019 is\nincapable of such pleasure.\n\n\nRyle (1954) argued that all sensations have felt location. For\nexample, one feels the pain of toe-stubbing to be located in\none's toe. Ryle also argued that pleasure has no felt location,\nand he concluded that it cannot be a sensation. Phenomenalists about\npleasure need not contest any of this. They need not think pleasure is\na sensory or a sensation state or property, and if they allow that\nbodily phenomenal pain does have intentional character, they can\naccount for the felt location of one's pain of toe-stubbing in\nterms of its being directed at one's toe. Much the same is true\nof intentionalists. They can claim that pleasure is an intentional\nstate or property, without claiming that its intentional character\ninvolves its having any felt location. For example, my delight in the\nday is about the day, not about any bodily location of mine. Moderate\nphenomenalism and moderate intentionalism are thus consistent with Ryle\non these points. Ryle's arguments do nevertheless present\nchallenges for some pleasure-pain symmetry theses.\n\n\nIt is plausible that at least some pleasures have directedness.\nThese pleasures present challenges for radical phenomenalists who deny\nthat any pleasure has any intentional character. They need not trouble\nmore modest forms of phenomenalism that do allow also for intentional\ncharacter.\n\n\nOne option is to claim that some pleasures do not have any\nintentional character and are thus not directed at or about anything.\nFor example, it might be claimed that there is objectless euphoria and\necstasy, or that undirected feelings of anxiety or suffering exist.\nSuch cases would be no trouble for the sorts of phenomenalism that\nreject any form of intentionalism about pleasure. Intentionalists, by\ncontrast, must insist that every pleasure and displeasure has an\nobject. They might argue, for example, that allegedly objectless\neuphoria and ecstasy or anxiety in fact do have objects, even if these\nobjects are not fully determinate; perhaps, for example, they are\ndirected at things in general, or one's life in\ngeneral. Intentionalists might add that the indeterminacy of these\nobjects is part of the charm of \u2018objectless\u2019 euphoria and\necstasy, and of the awfulness of \u2018objectless\u2019 anxiety and\ndepression. In support of the broader idea that intentional states can\nhave vague or indeterminate objects, while ordinary or substantial\nobjects cannot, Elizabeth Anscombe offered this pugilist's\nexample: \u201cI can think of a man without thinking of a man of any\nparticular height; I cannot hit a man without hitting a man of any\nparticular height, because there is no such thing as a man of no\nparticular height\u201d (Anscombe: 161). A different response to the\nclaim that some pleasures and displeasures are objectless is to move to\na fundamentally pluralist view, according to which some pleasure and\ndispleasure is intentional, other pleasure and displeasure is\nphenomenal, and some of the latter has no intentional character at\nall.\n\n\nMonism about pleasure is the thesis that there is just one basic\nkind of mental state or property that is pleasure. Phenomenal monism\nholds that there is just one basic kind pleasure feeling or tone, while\nintentional monism claims there is just one basic kind of pleasure\nintentional state or property. The disunity objection to monism is\nbased on the claim that there is no unified or common element in all\ninstances of pleasure (e.g., Sidgwick: 127, Alston: 344, Brandt: 35\u201342,\nParfit: 493, Griffin: 8, Sprigge: ch. 5). With few exceptions if any,\nsuch objections have to date targeted phenomenal monism. But both the\nobjection and the possible replies to it are under-explored in the\ndifferent context of intentional monism. The standard phenomenal monist\nreply is to insist that there is just one basic kind of\npleasure and that this is a matter of there being a common element in\npleasure's feeling, felt tone, or phenomenology, or in\n\u2018what it is like\u2019 to have pleasure (e.g., Moore: 12\u201313,\nBroad: 229, Sumner: 87\u201391). Broad, for example, wrote that the common\nphenomenal character of pleasure is something \u201cwe cannot define\nbut are perfectly acquainted with\u201d (Broad: 229). Alternatively,\nif some definition is to be attempted, one thought is that the common\nphenomenal character of all pleasure is just its felt pleasantness. A\ndifferent claim is that there is a common feel-good character or felt\npositivity in all pleasure. This claim is not clear, but can be spelt\nout in at least the following three different ways: that there is such\na property as felt positivity and that all instances of pleasure have\nit; that all pleasure consists partly in feeling the existence of\ngoodness or value; or that all pleasure has goodness or value as an\nintentional object, and this is so whether or not goodness or value\nexists.\n\n\nPluralism in the present setting is the thesis that there is more\nthan one basic kind of state or property that is pleasure, that\npleasure is multiply or variously or diversely realizable, or that\nthere is a basic plurality of sufficient conditions for pleasure. The\ncore idea is that there is a basic plurality of kinds of feel or of\nintentional state, each of which is a kind of pleasure (e.g., Rachels,\nLabukt, perhaps Rawls: 557). The unity objection to any such pluralism\nis that all instances of pleasure must meet some unitary sufficient\ncondition, and that pluralism is inconsistent with this. The obvious\npluralist reply is to reject this demand for unitariness. One rationale\nfor this reply is that multiple or plural realization theses about many\nkinds of mental states are coherent, widely made and merit serious\nconsideration, so the unity objector is not justified in thus seeking\nto rule them out at the outset of inquiry into the nature of\npleasure.\n\n\nReflection on both the disunity objection to monism and the unity\nobjection to pluralism about pleasure suggests a further option. This\nis the thesis that there is some feature that is phenomenal or\nintentional or both and that is common to all instances of pleasure,\nand that in addition, some pleasures differ from others in at least one\nother respect that has phenomenal or intentional character or both. One\nmotivation for such views is to draw out and combine insights from both\nmonism and pluralism about the nature of pleasure.\n\n\nWhich features of pleasure are most closely related to its value?\nBentham claimed that there are at least six \u2018dimensions of value\nin a pleasure or a pain\u2019: intensity, duration, certainty or\nuncertainty, propinquity or remoteness, fecundity, and purity (Bentham:\nch. 4). On one account, fecundity is a matter of being instrumental in\nother pleasure or pain, purity is a matter of separating pleasure out\nfrom non-pleasure, propinquity and remoteness concern temporal and/or\nspatial nearness or farness, and the essentials of certainty and\nuncertainty are plain enough. Recalling that non-instrumental value is\nthe present point of focus, Bentham's account suggests the\nquantitative hedonist idea that the non-instrumental value of pleasure\nis a matter just of its quantitative features, and that these reduce\njust to its duration and its intensity.\n\n\nQuantitative hedonism is consistent with monist phenomenalism about\npleasure, with \u2018intensity\u2019 here understood as \u2018felt\nintensity\u2019. It is also consistent with pluralist phenomenalism\nabout pleasure, but only on the assumption that none of the\nplurality-making features of pleasure also adds non-instrumentally to\nits value. It is less straightforward to see how to combine\nquantitative hedonism with those forms of intentionalism that deny that\npleasure need have any phenomenal character. Such accounts would need\nto explain the intensity or strength of pleasure in intentional terms\nand without making any appeal to felt intensity.\n\n\nResponding especially to the charge that a Benthamite account is a\n\u2018doctrine worthy only of swine\u2019, J.S. Mill (ch. 2)\ndeveloped an alternative approach according to which there is\n\u2018higher\u2019 and \u2018lower\u2019 pleasure, and its value is\nirreducibly a matter of its quality as well as its quantity. Mill\nargued that of two sorts of pleasures, if there is one that at least a\nmajority of those who have experience of both prefer then it is the\nmore desirable. The standard criticism of this qualitative hedonism is\nthat pleasure's quality reduces either to its quantity, or to\nsome anti-hedonist claim about value. The best sort of reply for\nqualitative hedonists is to present an account that does not suffer\nfrom either such reduction or such collapse. Pluralism about the nature\nof pleasure seems to be necessary for this, together with the claim\nthat one or more of the plurality-constituting features of pleasure\ndoes also add non-instrumentally add to its value. Qualitative\nhedonists who are also phenomenalists about pleasure will seek to find\nthe sources of such value differences in phenomenal differences.\nQualitative hedonists who are also intentionalists about the nature of\npleasure will seek to find the sources of such value differences in\nirreducibly non-quantitative differences amongst pleasures in the\nintentional mode, in the intentional content, or in both of these\naspects of these mental states or properties. Feldman's\n\u2018Truth-Adjusted Intrinsic Attitudinal Hedonism\u2019 is a view\nof this sort, due to its claim that the amount of intrinsic value of a\nlife is a matter of the truth-adjusted amount of its intrinsic\nattitudinal pleasure (Feldman 2004: 112). The same is true of\nFeldman's \u2018Desert-Adjusted Intrinsic Attitudinal\nHedonism\u2019, according to which the amount of intrinsic value of a\nlife is a matter of the desert-adjusted amount of its intrinsic\nattitudinal pleasure (Feldman 2004: 121).\n\n\nOne significant objection to hedonism about value is based on claims\nabout the nature and existence of pleasure. It assumes hedonism about\nvalue, conjoins this with the eliminativist thesis that there is no\nsuch thing as pleasure, infers the nihilist thesis that nothing\nactually has value, rebounds by rejecting this value nihilism, and then\nconcludes by retaining eliminativism about pleasure while rejecting\nhedonism about value. The most radical forms of eliminativism about\npleasure are across-the-board theses: there is no such thing as\npleasure, or there is no such thing as pain (e.g., Dennett; criticized\nby Flanagan amongst others), or both. Objections of the above sort that\nare based on the most radical eliminativist thesis speak against all\nforms of hedonism. Objections based on eliminativism about only\nphenomenal pleasure, or about only intentional pleasure, or about only\nsensational pleasure (e.g., Ryle, perhaps Sidgwick: 127, perhaps\nAristotle 1175a22f) speak against only the correspondingly narrower\nforms of hedonism.\n\n\nWhy believe eliminativism about phenomenal or intentional pleasure?\nOne sort of argument for it moves from the premise that there is no\nphenomenally or intentionally distinctive character common to all\ninstances of, for example, new romantic love, slaking a powerful\nthirst, sexual orgasm, solving a hard intellectual problem, and\nfireside reminiscence amongst friends, to the conclusion that there is\nno such thing as phenomenal or intentional pleasure. This sort of\nargument relies on monism about pleasure, and monism about pleasure is\nargued above to be questionable. Why believe eliminativism about\nsensational pleasure? One sort of argument for it is that any such\npleasure must be a sensation, and any sensation must have felt\nlocation, but no pleasure has felt location, so no pleasure sensation\nexists. Perhaps the most promising sort of hedonist response is to\nargue against eliminativism about pleasure, or at least against\neliminativism about pleasure on some particular favoured account of its\nnature.\n\n\nThis section has discussed the nature of pleasure as it bears on\nethical hedonism. It has outlined phenomenalist accounts,\nintentionalist accounts and hybrid accounts of pleasure. It has\nexamined various critical issues for hedonism that are related to the\nnature of pleasure, especially: quantitative versus qualitative\nhedonism, disunity objections to monistic hedonism and unity objections\nto pluralistic hedonism, and arguments from eliminativism about\npleasure to the rejection of hedonism about value. One overall\nconclusion to draw from this sub-section is that there would be benefit\nin further philosophical examination of the multiple connections\nbetween ethical hedonism and the phenomenal and intentional character\nof pleasure and displeasure.\n2.2 Other Arguments For Ethical Hedonism\n\n\nAt its simplest, ethical hedonism is the thesis that all and only\npleasure has positive non-instrumental importance and all and only pain\nor displeasure has negative non-instrumental importance. The focus\nbelow is on hedonism about value, and the discussion is intended to be\ngeneralizable also to other forms of ethical hedonism.\n\n\nConsider the following unification argument for hedonism about\nvalue: the case for the value of pleasure is stronger than the case for\nthe value of any non-pleasure; the more unified the theory of value the\nbetter it is; unification around the strongest case is better than\nunification around any other case; therefore: hedonism is the best\ntheory of value. This argument has weaknesses. Its first premise is not\nobviously true and needs further argument. In addition, the further\nargument that it still needs is in effect a separate argument for\nhedonism over its rivals, so this unification argument is not\nself-standing. Its second premise is also ambiguous between the claim\nthat a theory of value is in one respect better if it is more unified,\nand the claim that it is all-things-considered better if it is more\nunified. Plausibility requires the first interpretation, but the\nunification argument requires the second interpretation. In short,\nthere are significant problems with this unification argument for\nethical hedonism.\n\n\nHere is a motivation argument for hedonism about value: one's\nbasic motivation is always and only pleasure; all and only that which\nis one's basic motivation has value for one; therefore all and\nonly what is valuable for one is pleasure. On one interpretation, this\nargument appeals to a form of the motivational hedonist thesis that the\nonly object of our basic motives is pleasure. This form of motivational\nhedonism is questionable, as Section 1.2 discussed above. In addition,\nmotivational hedonism is most plausible as a claim about the role of\npleasure as an object of each of our motives, whether or not that\nobject actually exists in each case; whereas hedonism about value is\nmost plausible as a view just about real states or properties of\npleasure. Furthermore, this motivation argument depends on a\npro-attitude or motivation theory of value. It thus makes hedonism\nabout value an implication of, and in that respect dependent on, this\nform of subjectivism about value. On an alternative interpretation of\nthe motivation argument, its first premise is the pleasure-motive\nidentity thesis that our motives just are our pleasures (see\nHeathwood). For the motivation argument to bear fruit on this second\ninterpretation, its proponents need to show that this pleasure-motive\nidentity thesis is plausible.\n\n\nOne scientific naturalist argument for hedonism is this: in the\nvalue domain we should be scientific naturalists in our methods of\ninquiry; hedonism is the best option in respect of scientific\nnaturalism; therefore, we should be hedonists about value. Various\nissues arise. Both premises of the argument need support. First, what\nare scientific naturalist forms of inquiry into value, and why think\nthey should be adopted them in the value domain? One broadly scientific\nrationale for adopting such methods is the claim that their empirical\ntrack record is superior to that of philosophical theorising about\nvalue. But the thesis that naturalistic methods have a superior\nempirical track record or prospect is not obviously true and needs\nargument. A case also needs to be made that hedonism does do better\nthan its rivals in the scientific naturalist respect. Why think it has\nbetter naturalistic credentials, for example, than the numerous\nnon-hedonic and extra-hedonic mental states and properties, and the\nvarious forms of agency and of personal relationship, that are amongst\nthe promising rival or additional candidates for non-instrumental value\nstatus?\n\n\nConsider now this doxastic or belief argument for hedonism about\nvalue: all or most of us believe hedonism about value, albeit that some\nof us suffer from self-deception about that; and this state of our\nbeliefs supports hedonism itself. One response is that even if the\npremise is true it fails to support the conclusion. Consider\nstructurally similar cases. First, even if we all believe we have free\nwill and even if we cannot but believe this, it does not show that we\nactually have free will. Second, suppose instead that a strong general\nform of belief involuntarism is true, according to which we are not\nfree to have any beliefs other than those we do in fact have. Again,\nthis would not have any tendency to establish the truth of any of these\nbeliefs of ours, however robustly it might permit our having them. Any\nconvincing form of the doxastic or belief argument would need to\novercome such difficulties.\n\n\nPhenomenal arguments for hedonism move from some aspect of the felt\ncharacter of pleasure or pain to a thesis about the value of pleasure\nor pain.Some argue that pain or pleasure or both have felt character or\nfelt quality that generates reason to avoid or alleviate or minimize\nthe former and seek the latter (e.g., Nagel 1986: 156\u2013162). It might be\nthought that such phenomenal considerations can be deployed also in an\nargument for some form of ethical hedonism. One overall point is that\nthe most such phenomenal arguments can show is the sufficiency of\npleasure for value, and/or of pain for disvalue. Even if the relevant\nphenomenal character is unique to pleasure and pain, this can\nestablish at most that pleasure is necessary to phenomenal arguments\nfor value, and that pain is necessary to phenomenal arguments for\ndisvalue. It cannot show that pleasure and pain alone have\nnon-instrumental value. Phenomenal arguments also need to avoid appeal\nto any equivocation on \u2018quality\u2019. From the mere fact that\npain or pleasure has a certain felt quality in the sense of \u2018felt\ncharacter\u2019, it does not immediately follow that it has any felt\nquality in the sense of \u2018value\u2019 or\n\u2018disvalue\u2019.\n\n\nCan phenomenal arguments be strengthened? First, one might conjoin\nthe premise that pleasure has certain felt character with the premise\nthat all or most of us believe this felt character to be good. But this\nis just a doxastic argument again, plus a phenomenal account of the\nnature of pleasure. Second, one might instead appeal to the epistemic\nthesis that the felt character of pain and pleasure gives us direct\nawareness, perception or apprehension of the badness of pain and the\ngoodness of pleasure. One construal of this idea is that pleasure is an\nintentional feeling that has its own value or goodness as an object.\nEven if this thesis is granted, however, it is a general feature of\nintentional states that their objects might or might not exist. This\nbeing so, even if its own goodness is an intentional object of pleasure\nand its own badness is an intentional object of pain, it does not\nfollow that pleasure is good or that pain is bad. A third way to\ninterpret the phenomenal argument is as claiming that pleasure and pain\nare propositional feels that have feels-to-be-good and feels-to-be-bad\nintentional and phenomenal character, respectively. Again however, if\nsuch feels share the character of propositional attitudes in general,\nthen \u2018feels-to-be-good\u2019 does not entail\n\u2018is-good\u2019 and \u2018feels-to-be-bad\u2019 does not entail\n\u2018is-bad\u2019.\n\n\nCausal arguments for hedonism about value move from premises about\npleasure's causal relations to the conclusion that pleasure alone\nis valuable. One thing to note about the particular causal arguments\nfor hedonism that are discussed below (c.f. Crisp 2006: 120\u2013122) is\nthat they are in tension with doxastic arguments for hedonism (and with\nepistemic arguments, on which see below), because they counsel caution\nor even skepticism about the epistemic credentials of our\nhedonism-related beliefs.\n\n\nOne causal argument for hedonism is that autonomy, achievement,\nfriendship, honesty, and so on, generally produce pleasure, and this\nmakes us tend to think they have value of their own; in this way the\nvaluable pleasure produced by these non-pleasures tends to confound our\nthinking about what has value. Even granting that achievement,\nfriendship and the like tend to cause pleasure, however, why think this\nmerely instrumental consideration also causes us to think these\nnon-hedonic matters have their own non-instrumental value? Is there,\nfor instance, any empirical evidence for this claim? And even granted\nboth causal claims, why think these are the only causes of belief in\nnon-hedonism? Even granted that these are the only causes of\nnon-hedonist belief, why think these causes of belief justify it, and\nwhy think they are its only justifiers? Perhaps these questions all\nhave good hedonism-friendly answers, but that needs to be shown.\nAlternatively, perhaps this causal argument is instead exactly as good\nas the parallel causal argument from the thesis that pleasure generally\nproduces autonomy, achievement, and the like, to the opposite\nconclusion that hedonism is false.\n\n\nAnother causal argument for hedonism is that anti-hedonism about\nvalue is pleasure-maximizing; this tends to cause anti-hedonist belief;\nand it also justifies our having anti-hedonist belief without our\nneeding to think such belief true. As it stands, this argument is weak.\nThe issue is whether anti-hedonism is true, and this causal argument\nfails even to address that issue. Even if anti-hedonist belief has good\nor ideal consequences, and even if such consequences tend to produce\nsuch belief, this does not tend to establish either the truth or the\nfalsehood of anti-hedonism.\n\n\nExplanatory arguments for hedonism about value invite us to make a\nlist of the things that we regard as good or valuable, to ask of each\nof them \u2018why is it good?\u2019 or \u2018what explains its being\ngood?\u2019, to agree that all of the goodness or value of all but one\nsuch listed item is best explained by its generation of pleasure, and\nalso to agree that no satisfactorily explanatory answer can be given to\nsuch questions as \u2018why is pleasure good?\u2019 or \u2018what\nexplains pleasure's being good?\u2019. Proponents of the\nexplanatory argument then conclude in favour of hedonism about\nvalue.\n\n\nThose already sympathetic to hedonism about value should find\nexplanatory arguments congenial. It is a good question, partly\nempirical in nature, how the explanatory argument will strike those not\nalready inclined either for or against hedonism about value. Those\nalready sympathetic to non-hedonist pluralism about value, however, can\nreasonably respond with some scepticism to explanatory arguments for\nhedonism. They can hold that the non-instrumental value of each of\npleasure, knowledge, autonomy, friendship and achievement (or any other\ngood proposed instead) is best explained by its own non-instrumental\nfeatures. Subjectivists will add that these non-instrumental features\nare matters of each item's being some object of some actual or\ncounterfactual pro-stance. Objectivists will instead claim that the\nnon-instrumental features of pleasure, achievement, friendship,\nknowledge and autonomy that explain its value are independent of its\nbeing any object of any pro-stance. All parties can also agree that at\nleast part of the instrumental goodness or value of pleasure,\nknowledge, autonomy, friendship and achievement is best explained by\nits generation of pleasure.\n\n\nEpistemic arguments for hedonism about value claim that pleasure\nclearly or obviously has value (c.f. Crisp 2006: 124), and that nothing\nelse clearly does; and they conclude that this justifies belief in\nhedonism about value. But the assertion that pleasure's value\nclaims are clearer or more robust or more obvious than those of any\nother candidate for value status needs argument. Until this is\nsupplied, perhaps by doxastic, phenomenal, explanatory, or causal\narguments, epistemic arguments add little to the case for hedonism\nabout value.\n\n\nThis sub-section has outlined and reviewed some of the main forms of\nargument for hedonism about value: unification, motivation, scientific\nnaturalist, doxastic, phenomenal, explanatory, causal and epistemic\narguments. Arguments of each of these sorts could also be made for\nother forms of ethical hedonism. Each argument is problematical, but\nperhaps one or more of them can be made robust. Perhaps other promising\narguments for ethical hedonism might also be developed. Even if all\nsuch arguments fail, this would still not in itself be a convincing\noverall case against hedonism. The next sub-section examines arguments\nagainst ethical hedonism.\n2.3 Other Arguments Against Ethical Hedonism\n\n\nThere are many and varied arguments against ethical hedonism. Those\nthat appeal to claims about the nature of pleasure are canvassed in\nSection 2.1 above. Further arguments against ethical hedonism could be\nconstructed that broadly parallel the unification, motivation,\nscientific naturalist, doxastic, phenomenal, explanatory, causal and\nepistemic arguments for ethical hedonism presented and examined in\nSection 2.2 above. That task is not pursued in this entry. The\nfollowing sub-sections instead review other objections to ethical\nhedonism.\n2.3.1 Non-Necessity Objections\n\n\nAt its simplest, ethical hedonism is the thesis that all and only\npleasure is good non-instrumentally, and all and only pain or\ndispleasure is bad non-instrumentally. The non-necessity objection to\nthis rejects its claim that only pleasure is good, or its claim that\nonly displeasure is bad, or both of these claims. Its thesis is that\npleasure is not necessary for positive importance, or that displeasure\nis not necessary for negative importance, or both. Its basic idea is\nthat something other than pleasure has value, and/or that something\nother than displeasure has disvalue. Any cases that are hedonic equals\nbut value unequals would deliver what the non-necessity objector\nseeks.\n\n\nOne expression of the non-necessity objection is the following\narticulated \u2018incredulous stare\u2019 (after Lewis 1986). Why\nwould anyone think, even for a minute, that hedonism is a plausible\ntheory of value? Even if we focus very narrowly, just on those mental\nstates of ours that arguably are instances of pleasure or have pleasure\nas a higher-order property \u2013 contentment, delight, ecstasy,\nelation, enjoyment, euphoria, exhilaration, exultation, gladness,\ngratification, gratitude, joy, liking, love, relief, satisfaction,\nSchadenfreude, tranquility, and so on \u2013 each of these mental\nstates or events or properties also has one or more non-hedonic\nproperties that contribute to its importance. Beyond pleasure, our\nmental lives are full of significant and diverse thoughts, perceptions,\nemotions, imaginings, wishes, and so on. These engage with massively\nplural and diverse items in ourselves, in others, in myriad aspects of\nthe non-human world, and in the infinities of contingent future\npossibility. This is true also of our relationships with ourselves and\nwith others, and with multiple aspects of the wider world. It is true\nalso of our agency \u2013 our deliberations, choices, plans,\nintentions, and so forth. In the light of such reflections, an\nincredulous stare might be thought an apt response to a profession of\nbelief in ethical hedonism. This incredulous stare argument is far from\ndecisive, but perhaps it should disrupt any complacent presumption in\nfavour of hedonism.\n\n\nMany well-known criticisms of hedonism can reasonably be interpreted\nas non-necessity objections. A short survey of some of the more\nsignificant of these follows.\n\n\nPlato pointed out that if your life is just one of pleasure then it\nwould not even include any recollection of pleasure; nor any distinct\nthought that you were pleased, even when you were pleased. His\nconclusion was that \u201cyour life would be the life, not of a man,\nbut of an oyster\u201d (Philebus 21a). Similarly, on J.S.\nMill's account of him at least (Mill: ch. 2), Carlyle held that\nhedonism is a \u201cdoctrine worthy only of swine\u201d.\n\n\nNozick (1971) and Nagel (1970) present schematic descriptions of\nlives that have all the appearance but none of the reality of\nself-understanding, achievement, loving relationships,\nself-directedness, and so on, alongside lives that have these\nappearances and also the corresponding realities. On the face of it,\nhedonism is committed to the hedonic equality and thus the equal value\nof these lives. Commenting on his more fantastical and more famous\n\u2018experience machine\u2019 case, Nozick added further detail,\nclaiming that it is also good in itself \u201cto do certain things,\nand not just have the experience [as if] of doing them\u201d,\n\u201cto be a certain way, to be a certain sort of person\u201d and\nnot just to be an \u201cindeterminate blob\u201d floating in a tank,\nand \u201cto make a difference in the world\u201d rather than merely\nto appear to oneself to do so. He concluded: \u201csomething matters\nto us in addition to experience\u201d (Nozick 1974: 43\u201344).\n\n\nConsider further the idea that actually having certain relationships\nwith oneself (e.g., relations of self-understanding) and with others\n(e.g., mutual relations of interpersonal love) matters, in addition to\nthe value of any experience one has that is just as if one has such\nrelationships. The thought here is that the motto \u2018also\nconnect\u2019 expresses something important, even if novelist E.M.\nForster's more ambitious \u2018only connect\u2019 (Forster: ch.\n33) was an exaggeration.\n\n\nIn a famous case description, Moore argued that a world with beauty\nbut without its contemplation, and indeed without any mental states\nwhatever, is better than a world that is \u201csimply one heap of\nfilth\u201d (Moore: sec. 50; contrast Sidgwick: 114). If Moore is\nright about this \u2018beauty and the filth\u2019 case, then pleasure\nis not necessary for value.\n\n\nW.D. Ross (138) considered two worlds that are equals both\nhedonically and in character terms. In one world, the virtuous have the\npleasure and the vicious have the pain, while in the other the vicious\nhave the pleasure and the virtuous have the pain. To help secure across\nall plausible accounts of the nature of pleasure the \u2018equality of\npleasure\u2019 that is central to this case comparison, suppose that\nin each world the same pleasures are taken in the same objects.\nPleasure is equal across these two worlds, but Ross argues that the\nwell-matched world is better than the mis-matched world. If he is\nright, then this is a case of \u2018same pleasure, different\nvalue\u2019, and thereby also a case in which difference of pleasure\nis not necessary for difference of value.\n\n\nImagining oneself to have a hedonically perfect life, a\nnon-necessity objector is apt to respond along the lines of the popular\nPaul Jabara / Jo Asher song: \u2018Something's missing in my\nlife\u2019. One way to fill out the detail is with some variant of\nthat song's second premise: \u2018Baby it's you\u2019.\nThe objectors' claim is that there is something that is\nsufficient for value and that is missing from the life of perfect\npleasure. If the objection stands then pleasure is not necessary for\nvalue.\n\n\nThere is a range of possible hedonist responses to non-necessity\nobjections. One reply is that the allegedly non-hedonic item on which\nthe objector focuses just is an instance of pleasure, so its\nbeing valuable is just what a hedonist would expect. A related reply is\nthat the item to which the objector points is sufficient for value only\ninsofar as it is an instance of pleasure, so the thesis that pleasure\nis necessary for value again remains unscathed. Responses of these\nsorts are relatively easy for hedonists to make; but it is less easy to\nshow anyone who is not already a hedonist that these replies provide\ngrounds for taking the hedonist side of the arguments. A third reply\nhedonists might make to non-necessity objections is to allow that the\nitem in question is or includes non-pleasure that has value, but then\nto argue that this is merely instrumental value. A fourth and more\nconcessive reply is that the item in question might be a non-pleasure\nand might be sufficient for non-instrumental value of some sort (e.g.,\nmoral value), but to add that there is also at least one sort of value\n(e.g., prudential value) for which pleasure is necessary. For example,\nit might be claimed that self-sacrifice that protects the non-sentient\nenvironment has non-hedonic moral value but lacks prudential value for\nthe agent. An option that is yet more concessive is for hedonists is to\nagree that pleasure is not necessary for value or that displeasure is\nnot necessary for disvalue or both of these things, but to continue to\ninsist that pleasure is sufficient for value or that displeasure is\nsufficient for disvalue or both of these things.\n2.3.2 Insufficiency Objections\n\n\nAs noted above, the simplest form of ethical hedonism is the claim\nthat all and only pleasure is good non-instrumentally and all and only\npain or displeasure is bad non-instrumentally. The insufficiency\nobjection rejects the ethical hedonist claim that all pleasure is good,\nor that all displeasure is bad, or both claims. Its contrary thesis is\nthat pleasure is insufficient for good, and/or that displeasure is\ninsufficient for bad; some pleasure has no value, and/or some\ndispleasure has no disvalue. Any pair of cases that are value equals\nbut hedonic unequals would deliver what the insufficiency objector\nseeks.\n\n\nVarious insufficiency objections are outlined below. Each aims to\nshow that some pleasure is worthless or worse and is thus insufficient\nfor good or value. Some focus on the bad as cause of pleasure, others\non the bad as object of pleasure. A third possible focus is on pleasure\nunderstood as a property of something bad such as a sadistic thought or\nact, rather than as an effect of something bad.\n\n\nAristotle (Book x, ch. 3) argued that some pleasure is disgraceful\nor base. Brentano (1889/1969: 90) argued that \u201cpleasure in the\nbad\u201d both lacks value and has disvalue. Moore (sec. 56) expressed\nsimilar thoughts in a bracingly concrete manner by imagining the\npleasures of \u201cperpetual indulgence in bestiality\u201d and\nclaiming them to be not good but bad. Self-destructive or masochistic\npleasure, pleasure with a non-existent or false object, and\ncontra-deserved pleasure are some other targets of insufficiency\nobjections to hedonism about value.\n\n\nHedonists can respond in various ways to insufficiency objections.\nThese are canvassed below.\n\n\nOne sort of hedonist response to an insufficiency objection is to\naccept that the objector's case is an instance of pleasure, but\nthen to claim that it is sufficient for value. This response\nis underpinned by insistence on the wider thought that any pleasure is\nsufficient for value. Consistent with this, but rather concessively, it\ncould also be claimed that pleasure is sufficient for only very little\nvalue, and that substantial or major value is present only if further\nconditions are met. Such further conditions might concern the extent to\nwhich the pleasure is \u2018higher\u2019 rather than\n\u2018lower\u2019, whether its object exists, or whether its object\nmerits pleasure. Feldman (2004) has formulated and sympathetically\nexamined several views that have this sort of structure, including\nAltitude-Adjusted, Truth-Adjusted, and Desert-Adjusted forms of\nIntrinsic Attitudinal Hedonism.\n\n\nA second hedonist response is to accept that the insufficiency\nobjector has indeed found a case that is insufficient for value, but\nthen to claim that it is not an instance of pleasure. This\nsort of response is underpinned by the hedonist's insistence on\nthe wider thought that anything insufficient for value is not\npleasure.\n\n\nA third hedonist response is somewhat concessive. It distinguishes\nat least two basic kinds of value, and continues to insist that\npleasure is sufficient for one of these, while also accepting the\nobjector's thesis that there is at least one other sort of value\nfor which pleasure is not sufficient. One instance of this response is\nthe claim that sadistic pleasure adds prudential value for the sadist\nbut also lacks moral value and indeed has moral disvalue. But such a\nmove is more awkward in other cases, including those of pleasure that\nis self-destructive or masochistic.\n\n\nA fourth hedonist response is concessive. It abandons altogether the\nthesis that pleasure is sufficient for value, while also continuing to\ninsist that pleasure is necessary for value. Consistent with this\nresponse, one could claim that pleasure is conditionally valuable; that\nis, sufficient for value when and only when certain further conditions\nare met. These conditions could be specified either negatively (e.g.,\npleasure is valuable only when it does not arise from and is not\ndirected at a bad deed or character state or state of affairs), or\npositively (e.g., pleasure is valuable only when its object exists, or\nonly when its object is deserving of it). Modified forms of\nAltitude-Adjusted, Truth-Adjusted, and Desert-Adjusted Intrinsic\nAttitudinal Hedonism would have this structure (see Feldman 2004).\n3. Concluding Remarks\n\n\nThe critical discussion of Section 2 above has supplemented the\nSection 1 consideration of psychological hedonism, by examining\narguments both for and against ethical hedonism. On one influential\nview that John Rawls attributes to Henry Sidgwick, justification in\nethics ideally proceeds against \u201cstandards of reasoned\njustification\u2026 carefully formulated\u201d, and\n\u201csatisfactory justification of any particular moral conception\nmust proceed from a full knowledge and systematic comparison of the\nmore significant conceptions in the philosophical tradition\u201d\n(editor's \u2018Foreword\u2019 to Sidgwick). This entry has not\nattempted any such systematic comparative examination of psychological\nhedonism or ethical hedonism against its main rivals.\n\n\nBoth psychological hedonism and ethical hedonism remain worthy of\nserious philosophical attention. Each also has broader philosophical\nsignificance, especially but not only in utilitarian and egoist\ntraditions of ethical thought, and in empiricist and scientific\nnaturalist philosophical traditions.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alston, W.P.
