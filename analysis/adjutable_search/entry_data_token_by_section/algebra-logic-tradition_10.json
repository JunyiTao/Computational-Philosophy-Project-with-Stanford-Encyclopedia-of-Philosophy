    "main_text": "Skolem: Quantifier Elimination and Decidability\n11. Tarski and the Revival of Algebraic Logic\n\nModel theory can be regarded as the product of Hilbert\u2019s methodology\nof metamathematics and the algebra of logic tradition, represented\nspecifically by the results due to L\u00f6wenheim and Skolem. But it\nwas Tarski who gave the discipline its classical foundation. Model\ntheory is the study of the relations between a formal language and its\ninterpretation in \u201crealizations\u201d (that is, a domain for\nthe variables of the language together with an interpretation for its\nprimitive signs). If the interpretation happens to make a sentence of\nthe language state something true, then the interpretation is a\nmodel of the sentence (see the entry on\n model theory).\n Models consist basically of algebraic structures, and model theory\nbecame an autonomous mathematical discipline with its roots not only\nin the algebra of logic but in abstract algebra (see Sinaceur\n1999).\n\nApart from model theory, Tarski revived the algebra of relations in\nhis 1941 paper \u201cOn the Calculus of Relations\u201d. First he\noutlined a formal logic based on allowing quantification over both\nelements and relations, and then he turned to a more detailed study of\nthe quantifier-free formulas of this system that involved only\nrelation variables. After presenting a list of axioms that obviously\nheld in the algebra of relations as presented in Schr\u00f6der\u2019s third\nvolume he proved that these axioms allowed one to reduce\nquantifier-free relation formulas to equations. Thus his calculus of\nrelations became the study of a certain equational theory which he\nnoted had the same relation to the study of all binary relations on\nsets as the equational theory of Boolean algebra had to the study of\nall subsets of sets. This led to questions paralleling those already\nposed and resolved for Boolean algebras, for example, was every model\nof his axioms for relation algebras isomorphic to an algebra of\nrelations on a set? One question had been answered by Arwin Korselt\n(1864\u20131947), namely there were first-order sentences in the\ntheory of binary relations that were not equivalent to an equation in\nthe calculus of relations\u2014thus the calculus of relations\ndefinitely had a weaker expressive power than the first-order theory\nof relations. Actually the expressive power of relation algebra is\nexactly equivalent to first-order logic with just three variables.\nHowever, if in relation algebras (the calculus of relations) one wants\nto formalize a set theory which has something such as the pair axiom,\nthen one can reduce many variables to three variables, and so it is\npossible to express any first-order statement of such a theory by an\nequation. Monk proved that, unlike the calculus of classes, there is\nno finite equational basis for the calculus of binary relations (see\nMonk 1964). Tarski and Givant (1987) showed that the equational logic\nof relation algebras is so expressive that one can carry out\nfirst-order set theory in it.\n\nFurthermore, cylindric algebras, essentially Boolean algebras equipped\nwith unary cylindric operations \\(C_x\\) which are intended to capture\nthe existential quantifiers (\\(\\exists x\\)), were introduced in the\nyears 1948\u20131952 by Tarski, working with his students Louise Chin\nand Frederick Thompson (see Henkin & Tarski 1961), to create an\nalgebra of logic that captured the expressive power of the first-order\ntheory of binary relations. Polyadic algebra is another approach to an\nalgebra of logic for first-order logic\u2014it was created by Halmos\n(1956c). The focus of work in these systems was again to see to what\nextent one could parallel the famous results of Stone for Boolean\nalgebra from the 1930s.\n",
