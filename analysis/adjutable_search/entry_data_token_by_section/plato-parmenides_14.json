Within the Appendix, there are five Arguments\nwith the following Conclusions: If the one is, then there are\ntimes T1 and T2 such that T1 is distinct\nfrom T2 and the one partakes of being at T1 and the\none does not partake of being at T2 (AppA1C), there is a\ndefinite time at which the one comes to be (AppA2C1), there is a\ndefinite time at which the one ceases to be (AppA2C2), there is a time\nat which the one ceases to be many (AppA3C1), there is a time at which\nthe one ceases to be one (AppA3C2), there is a time at which the one\nis combined (AppA3C3), there is a time at which the one is separated\n(AppA3C4), there is a time at which the one is made like (AppA3C5),\nthere is a time at which the one is made unlike (AppA3C6), there is a\ntime at which the one is increased (AppA3C7), there is a time at which\nthe one is decreased (AppA3C8), there is a time at which the one is\nmade equal (AppA3C9), there is something (call it \u201cthe\ninstant\u201d) (i) that is in no time at all and (ii) at which the\none changes both from being in motion to being at rest and from being\nat rest to being in motion and (iii) at which the one is neither at\nrest nor in motion (AppA4C), there is something (call it \u201cthe\ninstant\u201d) (i) that is in no time at all and (ii) at which the\none changes both from not-being to being and from being to not-being\nand (iii) at which the one neither is nor is not (AppA5C1), there is\nsomething (call it \u201cthe instant\u201d) (i) that is in no time\nat all and (ii) at which the one changes both from being one to being\nmany and from being many to being one and (iii) at which the one is\nneither one nor many (AppA5C2), there is something (call it \u201cthe\ninstant\u201d) (i) that is in no time at all and (ii) at which the\none changes both from being like to being unlike and from being unlike\nto being like and (iii) at which the one is neither like nor unlike\n(AppA5C3), and there is something (call it \u201cthe instant\u201d)\n(i) that is in no time at all and (ii) at which the one changes both\nfrom being small to being large and from being large to being small\nand (iii) at which the one is neither large nor small (AppA5C4).\n\n\nAll of the individual Arguments within the Appendix are logically\ninterconnected. (For details, see Rickless (2007, 189\u2013198).)\n\n\nIt appears that every Argument of the Appendix is logically\nvalid. Like the Arguments of D1 and D2, the Arguments of the\nAppendix rest on a number of independent premises, including premises\nof D1 and D2. Again, most of the premises are, at least from\nPlato\u2019s point of view, either definitionally true or\nself-evident. (Gill (1996, 86) objects to one of the premises of\nAppA5. For a rejoinder, see Rickless (2007, 195, n. 2).)\nThere is one major exception to this claim, however. All of the\nArguments of the Appendix other than AppA1 depend for their soundness\non the soundness of AppA1. But AppA1 depends for its soundness on\nthe soundness of D1A17, which itself depends for its soundness on the\ntruth of Purity-F. So if Purity-F were false, then all the\nArguments of the Appendix would be unsound.\n",
