The theorist and composer\nJohannes Tinctoris (c. 1435\u20131511) exemplifies various aspects of\nthis new outlook on music. He defines harmony and consonance in terms\nof their appearance to the listener, rather than through mathematical\nnotions. Harmony is thus described as the pleasing effect produced by\nsounds, whereas consonance and dissonance are respectively\ncharacterized as combinations of sounds that bring sweetness to the\near or hurt it (Liber de arte contrapuncti, chapter 2). In\nhis Complexus effectuum musices, Tinctoris lists prominent\neffects of music, most of which involve emotional arousal, while the\ndedication of his Proportionale Musices refers back to\nAntiquity and the alleged emotional potency of its music.\n\nTinctoris thus prefigures two tendencies typical of early modern\nthinking about music: first, the focus on the subjective experience of\nmusic, and on the feelings of pleasure and displeasure that accompany\nit; second, the value attributed to music\u2019s expressive power,\nand the related idea that ancient music\u2019s capacity to arouse\nemotions was greater than that of the music of their time.\n\nThe first of these tendencies is also embodied in the work of Gioseffo\nZarlino (1517\u20131590). A towering figure in Western music theory,\nZarlino is normally considered as the theorist who initiated the move\naway from medieval modality and toward tonal harmony. According to\nZarlino, rules of composition are good insofar as they produce\nbeautiful music, whose purpose is to \u201cimprove\u201d and\n\u201cdelight\u201d (Zarlino 1558: book III, 71). However, Zarlino\ndoes not reject the role of rationality, and especially of\nmathematics, because its laws ultimately underlie the senses of sight\nand hearing (Zarlino 1588: 34\u201336).\n",
