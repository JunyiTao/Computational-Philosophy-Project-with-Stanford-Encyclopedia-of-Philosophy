    "main_text": "Mental aspects of aesthetic experience || Disinterest\n2.6 Normativity\n\nAt least since Kant\u2019s Critique of Judgment (1789) many\nhave thought that aesthetic experience involves a form of\nnormativity\u2014either that an aesthetic experience is the type one\nshould have of certain natural scenes or art objects, or that\nhaving some such experience entails thinking that others\nshould have the same experience of that object. Kant\ncertainly made the latter claim. As he put it, an object seems to you\nto merit a certain subjective response of disinterested\npleasure insofar as it sets your faculties of imagination and\nunderstanding into a form of free play (see Section 1.3 and Section\n2.3 above).\n\nBoth Kant and Hume before him (1757 [1987]) took it that aesthetics\ndemanded a reconciliation between two intuitively clashing facts:\nfirst, that the way to appreciate an object aesthetically is to\nfeel some way towards it; and second, that such appreciation\nis merited or deserved. Neither Hume nor Kant thought that beauty was\nan objective matter, even though we do speak of beauty as though it is\na property that inheres in objects (contrast Edith Landmann-Kalischer;\nsee Matherne 2020).\n\nEven though normativity is sometimes tied to objectivity\u2014you\nshould feel or think this about that, because it is an\nobjective matter\u2014this is not so obviously the case in philosophy\nof aesthetic experience. Objectivity and normativity have a tortured\nrelationship in this discussion.\n\nConsider, for instance, George Santayana\u2019s (1896) take. He\npresented beauty as \u201cpleasure regarded as the quality of a\nthing,\u201d i.e. \u201cobjectified\u201d (pp. 31\u20132). To have\nan aesthetic experience is to feel a form of pleasure not as\nbelonging to one\u2019s mind or body, but rather as if it\nbelonged to the object. This need not involve really thinking that the\npleasure really does belong to the object; on the contrary, he\nclaimed, \u201cbeauty \u2026 cannot be conceived as an independent\nexistence which affects our senses and we consequently perceive\u201d\n(p.29). For this reason, phenomenological objectification does not\nmake sense of demands that others feel as you do. On his view, such\ndemands are \u201cunmeaning\u201d (p.27). Nelson Goodman (1968\n[1976]) later called this \u201cmumbo-jumbo\u201d\u2014\u201cwhat\ncan this mean?\u201d (p.243). The only way we could make sense of the\nclaim that we feel as though pleasure really belongs to objects\nthemselves is as a claim that objects express pleasure, but\nnot all aesthetic objects do this.\n\nIn a certain respect, Santayana\u2019s claims of phenomenological\nobjectification are less mysterious than claims of actual\nobjectification of subjective feeling in other aesthetic systems. The\nearly empathy theorist Robert Vischer (1873 [1994]) claimed that the\nartist \u201ctranslate[s] the indefinability and instability of\nmental life, as well as the chaotic disorder of nature, into a\nmagnificent objectivity, into a clear reflection of a free\nhumanity,\u201d and thus generates an item whose investment with\nemotion has a form of universal validity (pp. 116\u201317, emphasis\nadded). Around this time, many of those who take aesthetic experience\nto focus on emotional expression spoke of emotion\n\u201cobjectified\u201d in objects, in a way that was then\ninseparable from the embodiment of that emotion in the physical form\n(Bosanquet 1892 [1904], p. 34; Ducasse 1929, p. 111; Dewey 1934\n[1980], p. 248; Cassirer 1944, pp. 142\u20134). Insofar as feeling\ncan literally be manifested in these physical forms, it is simply a\nmatter of appreciating qualities an object really has that you should\nappreciate such expression and feel certain emotions in their presence\n(see Section 1.4.4).\n\nNewer descendants of this view treat normativity in aesthetic\nexperience as derived from the correctness of seeing-as (or\notherwise perceiving-as). When Kendall Walton (1970) noted that the\nassignment of a category to an artwork affects the expressive\nproperties you experience it as having, he was careful to note that\nonly some category assignments are correct (p.356ff.). Roger Scruton\n(1974) went out on a limb to claim that even though seeing-as (and\nother perceiving-as) is a matter of imagination (see Section 2.3),\nthere are nonetheless right and wrong ways to apply your imagination\nto an object of your attention. Such choices in imagination\n\u201cinvolve a sense of their own \u2018correctness\u2019 or\nappropriateness to an object\u201d (pp. 138\u20139).\n\nKant (1789 [1987]), Vischer (1873 [1994]), and others took aesthetic\nnormativity to be universal: it\u2019s true that everyone\nought to feel a certain way about an object, given that the features\nthat ground that feeling are themselves universal among people.\nOthers\u2014including Scruton and the empathy theorist Herbert\nLangfeld (1920)\u2014are less sanguine about the prospect of\nuniversal agreement; they variously relativize the normative demands\nthat objects make upon us to feel certain ways (Kennick 1958, Goldman\n1995, Levinson 2006a, Matthen 2018). A few personalize the specific\ndemands that artworks or natural scenes can make on our emotions and\nfeelings as individuals (Moran 2004; Nehamas 2007; Riggle 2016; cf.\nNietzsche 1882 [1974] \u00a7290\u2013299 and Landy 2004 on Proust\n1913\u20131927 [2003]).\n\nA demand for someone to have a certain subjective experience of an\nobject only makes sense if they already can have such an experience,\nor at least could cultivate their capacity to have such an experience.\nThis capacity has long been called \u201ctaste\u201d (cf. Korsmeyer\n2013). The resonance with a form of sensation is no accident. Various\neighteenth-century British philosophers (notably Hutcheson 1726\n[2004], Hume 1739\u201340 [1987], and Reid 1785 [1969]) made sense of\nthis capacity as a form of \u201cinternal sense,\u201d whose inputs\nwere reliant upon the representations provided by sensation. Lively\ncontemporary discussion amongst French social elites considered the\nextent to which taste was innate or acquired (Bouhours 1671 [1705], Du\nBos 1719 [1748], Marquise de Lambert 1748 [1770]; see also\nMontesquieu, Voltaire, and d\u2019Alembert\u2019s 1757 and\nDiderot\u2019s 1751 entries into the Encyclop\u00e9die,\nDiderot and d\u2019Alembert, 1751\u20131765).\n\nMany contrasted this quasi-sensory faculty with that of reason\n(Bouhours 1671 [1705], Du Bos 1719 [1748], Marquise de Lambert 1748\n[1770], Montesquieu, Voltaire, and d\u2019Alembert 1757), although\nothers claimed in a post-Cartesian rationalist vein that an\nobject\u2019s beauty was primarily judged through the faculty of\nreason (de Crousaz 1714 [2000]; Andr\u00e9 1741), and even claimed\nthat it was possible to codify contributors to beauty in general\nprinciples (De Lambert, Voltaire, Diderot 1751). Kant (1789) notably\ndenied that any such general principles of taste could possibly be\nformulated or used to reason to the conclusion that something is\nbeautiful.\n\nIn the 20th century, the debate over principles of taste\nsaw a resurgence. Those who deny the existence of any general\nprinciples of taste are \u201cparticularists,\u201d and those who\naccept them \u201cgeneralists.\u201d Notable 20th-century\nparticularists include Croce 1938 [2007], Collingwood 1938 [1958],\nGallie 1956, Isenberg 1949, Sibley 1974, 1983, Mothersill 1988, and\nGoldman 2006 (cf. Kant 1789 [1987] \u00a734\u201335). Notable\ngeneralists include Beardsley (1958 [1981], 1970 [1982]) and Dickie\n2006. While generalists like Beardsley think that we can dispute\nmatters of taste in reasoned argument particularists generally work to\nmake sense of more subtle forms of interpersonal communication about\nexperience (see Isenberg 1949, Hopkins 2004, Mothersill 1988, Sibley\n2001, Cavell 1965 [2007], Wollheim 1968 [1980]).\n\nThere is a new efflorescence of philosophical research into aesthetic\nnormativity, much of which profits significantly from cross-comparison\nof various normative domains (Eaton 2001; Cross 2017, forthcoming;\nHanson 2018, Lopes 2018, 2021, Gorodeisky and Marcus 2018; Gorodeisky\n2019, 2021, Kubala 2021, Dyck 2021, Whiting 2021, forthcoming, Riggle,\nforthcoming; see King 2022 for an overview).\n",
