    "main_text": "The purely set-theoretic approach\n3. The purely set-theoretic approach\n\n\nBy contrast, the purely set-theoretic approach (Burge 1972; Grandy\n1973; Montague  1973[7])\ntreats\nmass nouns as ordinary predicates that denote\n sets[8].\nMass predication is interpreted as set\nmembership. For any mass noun M and predicate P:\n\nThis is M is true iff [this] \u2286 [M] Some M P is true iff [M] \u2229\n[P] \u2260 \u2205,\n\nwhere [this] is the set whose elements are what is\ndemonstrated, [M] is the set having for elements everything\nthat is M, [P] is the set having for elements\neverything that P.\n\n\nA difficulty for this approach is to\nspecify, for any mass noun M, what the \u201cportions of\nM\u201d are. This difficulty appears especially clearly with definite\ndescriptions, as in The gold on the table weighs fifty grams.\nIf the description the gold on the table denotes the set\nhaving for elements everything that is gold on the table, then how can\nwe evaluate the truth of the sentence? It would not do to give the sum\nof all weights (cf. Bunt 1985: 41). So it seems we must impose\nrestrictions on the elements of the set [the gold on the\ntable].[9]\n\nNow comes a second and crucial difficulty concerning identity over\ntime. Consider:\n\nThe clay that was on the desk on July 1st is identical\nwith the clay that was on the table on July 2nd.\n(Context of utterance: three solid bits of clay were on the desk on\nJuly 1st, and two solid bits of clay were on the table on\nJuly 2nd. Example inspired by Cartwright 1965.)\n\n\nWhich set could make [the clay that was on the desk on July\n1st] = [the clay that was on the table on July\n2nd] true? What about the set of all minimal parts of\nclay, i.e., the set of all the instances of clay that have no other\ninstance of clay as part?  However, with mass nouns like\ngarbage, it is not clear what the minimal parts would be\n(cf. Pelletier & Schubert 2003). And more crucially, one cannot\nexclude a priori the possibility that what a given mass noun\napplies to may be indefinitely divisible. So the semantics should not\nrequire mass nouns to have minimal parts (cf. Bunt 1985; Gillon 1992).\n(See section 9 for a solution to this problem\nwithin the framework of non-singular logic; see Steen 2012, section\n2.3, for various metaphysical considerations concerning the purely\nset-theoretic approach.)\n",
