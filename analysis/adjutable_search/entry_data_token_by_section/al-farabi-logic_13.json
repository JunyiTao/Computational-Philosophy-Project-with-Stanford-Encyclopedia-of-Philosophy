    "main_text": "Truth and Falsehood\n8. Truth and Falsehood\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b defines a concept to be \u201ctrue\u201d\n(\u1e63\u0101diq) if it is the same\n(bi-\u2018aynihi) in the external world as it is in the soul\n([Letters] (88) 116.3f) For this definition to make sense,\nthe concept need not be propositional. For example ([Letters]\n118.5f), the concept \u201cvacuum\u201d is not true, because it\nexists only in the mind and not in the external world (Abed (1991:\n111\u2013115) discusses the relationship between existence and truth\nin al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b).\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b quite often uses the derived causative noun\nta\u1e63d\u012bq, which has a range of meanings between\n\u201cverification\u201d (i.e., gaining certainty that a thing is\ntrue) and \u201cassent\u201d (i.e., treating a thing as true).\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b expounds this distinction at\n[Demonstration] 20.4\u201321.12. He also points to the range\nof meanings of ta\u1e63d\u012bq at [Attainment]\n90.6f: it can occur \u201ceither through certain demonstration or\nthrough persuasion\u201d. Presumably the certain demonstration brings\nabout verification and the persuasion brings about assent.\n\nAt [Expressions] 86.17\u201387.4 al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\ntells us that teaching has three steps:\n\u201cconceptualization\u201d (ta\u1e63awwur), where we\nunderstand what the concept is and what our teacher is telling us\nabout it; ta\u1e63d\u012bq; and \u201ccommitting to\nmemory\u201d\n (hif\u1e93).[24]\n [Demonstration] 80.22, in another passage on teaching, adds\nthat \u201cWe can seek ta\u1e63d\u012bq either of simple\nthings or of compound\u201d. For al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b a\nproposition is always compound, so he is telling us that\nnon-propositional concepts can be assented to.\n\nThe view that both propositions and non-propositional concepts can be\ntrue runs fairly deep in al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s thinking,\nalthough he recognizes that not everybody agrees with it\n([Commentary on De Interpretatione] 52.13f). For example,\nthis view allows him to think of definition of non-propositional\nconcepts and demonstration of propositions as overlapping procedures;\nthere can be definitions that are identical with demonstrations except\nin the order of their parts ([Demonstration]\n 47.11).[25]\n Avicenna a hundred years later found it essential to distinguish\nbetween non-propositional and propositional concepts. Provocatively he\nused al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s own terminology of\nta\u1e63awwur and ta\u1e63d\u012bq to fix the\ndistinction; for Avicenna any concept can be conceptualized, but only\npropositions can go on to be\n verified.[26]\n\n\nA sentence can be switched between true and false by adding a negative\nparticle, for example, \u201cIt is not the case that\u201d\n(laysa). But it matters where the negative particle is put;\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b discusses a number of cases, ad hoc with no\nclear overall pattern. One case that he discusses in detail is where\nthe negation is attached to a noun, as when we form the noun\n\u201cnot-just\u201d from the noun \u201cjust\u201d. (Adjectives\nare counted as nouns.) Following Theophrastus (Fortenbaugh et al.\n1992: 148\u2013153) he identifies this kind of negation as\n\u201cmetathetic\u201d (\u2018ud\u016bl\u012b); he takes\nthe resulting metathetic sentence to be an affirmation, not a denial.\nNothing can be both just and not-just, but there are things that are\nneither, for example infants. So an infant is not just, but it is also\nnot not-just. For a similar reason the infant is not unjust. Also it\nis false that the infant is just, and false that it is not-just.\nLikewise it is false (rather than meaningless) that every heat is\ncurvilinear ([Categories] 125.8). (Thom 2008 steers a clear\npath through these notions.)\n\nBefore al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, metathesis seems to have played\nlittle or no role in rules of inference. So an example in\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b with a metathetic subject term is worth\nnoting:\n\n\nIf every human is an animal, then every non-animal is a non-human.\n\n\nThis appears in his ([Analysis] 114.11f), where he introduces\nit as a topic. (Fallahi 2019 discusses this example.) \n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b holds that \u201cCome here\u201d is neither\ntrue nor false, but \u201cYou must come here\u201d, which can be\nused in place of it (yaq\u016bmu maq\u0101ma(hu)), is true or\nfalse ([Short De Interpretatione] 47.3\u201348.1). The\nreason is that the first sentence, unlike the second, has the wrong\nshape to be true or false. He could be read as saying that every\ncommand has the same meaning as some indicative sentence, but truth\nand falsehood depend on the form of words used, not just on the\nmeaning. But closer inspection shows that he uses the phrase\nyaq\u016bmu maq\u0101ma for some quite weak equivalences\nwhere the two sentences in question definitely mean different things.\nFor example, he uses the phrase when a questioner in a debate asks a\nquestion with a metathetic affirmation in place of a denial\n([Commentary on De Interpretatione] 136.6). His words for\ndifferent kinds of equivalence (for example, bi-manzila,\n\u201cin the same role as\u201d, which will be familiar to readers\nof Classical Arabic linguistics) deserve closer study. Having written\n[Expressions] and [Letters], he certainly deserves\nto have his prepositional phrases taken seriously.\n\nAt [Commentary on De Interpretatione] 89.12\u2013100.25\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b presents a distinctive view of statements\nabout the future (cf. Adamson 2006, Knuuttila 2020). In connection\nwith a future battle, the disjunction \u201cThe battle either will or\nwill not take place\u201d is a necessary proposition and hence true.\nBut since the future is indeterminate, neither of the sentences\n\u201cThe battle will take place\u201d and \u201cThe battle will\nnot take place\u201d is true; moreover the lapse of truth value is\nsomething intrinsic in the world, it is not just our ignorance.\nGranted, if Allah knows that Zayd will leave home tomorrow, then it is\ntrue now that Zayd will leave home tomorrow, and this implication is a\nnecessary truth. But the necessary truth of this implication\ndoesn\u2019t entail the necessary truth of its conclusion, and hence\nZayd still has the freedom to choose. Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\ndoesn\u2019t make clear whether he is doubting the modal\ninference\n\n\nNecessarily if p then q. Necessarily p. Therefore\nnecessarily q\n\n\nor whether he is allowing that there may be restrictions on what Allah\nnecessarily knows. (Hasnawi [1985: 28f] relates this passage to Muslim\ndebates about Allah\u2019s foreknowledge.)\n",
