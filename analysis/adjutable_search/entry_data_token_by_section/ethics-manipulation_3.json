    "main_text": "Answering the Identification Question\n2. Answering the Identification Question\n\nA number of accounts of manipulation have been put forward. They can\nbe grouped roughly into three main categories: those that characterize\nmanipulation as an influence that bypasses reason; those that treat it\nas a form of trickery, and those that treat it as a form of pressure.\nThese are rough categories, and a single theory might fit into more\nthan one of them. But they are useful groupings nonetheless.\n",
