    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe second century CE Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius was also a\nStoic philosopher, and his Meditations, which he wrote to and for himself, offers\nreaders a unique opportunity to see how an ancient person (indeed an\nemperor) might try to live a Stoic life, according to which only virtue\nis good, only vice is bad, and the things which we normally busy ourselves with\nare all indifferent to our happiness (for our lives are not made good or bad by our having or lacking them). The difficulties Marcus faces putting\nStoicism into practice are philosophical as well as practical, and\nunderstanding his efforts increases our philosophical appreciation of\nStoicism.\n",
