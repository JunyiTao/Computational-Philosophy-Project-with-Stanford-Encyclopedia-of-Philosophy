    "main_text": "Discrete geometries as direct analogs || The Finnish school and natural geometry\n2.2 The Finnish school and natural geometry\n\nPaul Kustaanheimo was a member of a group of mathematicians based at\nHelsinki, who were all interested in some form of finite geometry. The\nmost prominent members were G. J\u00e4rnefelt, P. Kustaanheimo, and R.\nLehti. The origin of their inspiration is to be found in the work of\nJ.T. Hjelmslev who developed so-called \u201cnatural\u201d geometry\n(\u201cDie nat\u00fcrliche Geometrie\u201d, see his 1923\nbook), also referred to sometimes as \u201cphysical\u201d geometry\n(and, as mentioned above, itself related to mereology). Their approach\nhas not known any continuation, one exception being Reisler and Smith\n(1969). However, in a strange way there is a connection with\nSuppes\u2019 and Burke\u2019s approach to be discussed later in the\nsense that geometry is primarily seen as (almost) an experimental\nscience, i.e., the geometer deals with rulers and compasses, creates\nflat surfaces to measure, and so on. Of course, since we humans can\nonly manipulate finite objects in finite ways, a discrete geometry\nmust result.\n\nKustaanheimo\u2019s proposal\u2014I reproduce here in rough outline\nthe excellent presentation of his proposal in Welti (1987:\n487\u2013521), which is far more accessible than the original\nwork\u2014is based on the following line of reasoning. A standard\nmodel for the classical axiomatic theory of Euclidean geometry\nconsists of the cartesian product of the real numbers with itself. Or,\nas it is usually formulated, a point in the plane is mapped onto a\ncouple of real numbers, its coordinates. The real numbers have the\nmathematical structure of an infinite field. But finite fields exist\nas well. So why not replace the infinite real number field with a\nfinite field, a so-called Galois field?\n\nThe best result one could obtain would be that every finite Galois\nfield satisfies most of the axioms of Euclidean geometry. That however\nis not the case. The outcome of Kustaanheimo\u2019s research is\nslightly more complicated:\n\nNot all finite fields will do. If we call \\(p\\) the number of\nelements in the domain of the finite field, then \\(p\\) has to satisfy\nsome conditions. This means that only finite fields of a particular\nsize, i.e., a specific value for \\(p\\), are potential candidates.\nFor the \u201cgood\u201d values of \\(p\\), the full model will\nnot do. As an example, take straight lines. According to their\ndefinition in a finite field, it turns out that there are two sorts of\nstraight lines: open and closed ones. The latter ones violate some of\nthe axioms, hence you restrict the model to the open ones. This\nrestriction of the model is called the Euclidean \u201ckernel\u201d\nof the model.\n\n\nIn short, one cannot claim that any finite field will do, but only\nsome and for that matter only part of it.\n\nThis approach raises some important philosophical questions:\n\nIt is clear that the size of the model is an important feature.\nDoes this have any meaning? Or, negatively, what does it mean that\nfields of a different size are not suitable as models? Suppose as a\nthought experiment that Euclidean geometry is a good model for the\ngeometrical structure of the universe. Does it make sense to claim\nthat the universe must contain exactly \\(p\\) points (not \\(p-1\\), not\n\\(p+1\\))? A new sort of Pythagoreanism seems to be lurking around the\ncorner here.\nThe example of the straight lines shows that there are\n\u201cnice\u201d geometrical objects (those that satisfy most of the\naxioms) and \u201cbad\u201d geometrical objects. Ignoring\nthe bad ones is perhaps a mathematically interesting strategy, but it\ndoes not eliminate them from the full model. In other words,\nalthough they do not play any relevant part in the\n\u201ckernel\u201d of the model, they are there. What is the meaning\nof that? To continue the above thought experiment, the question is\nwhat corresponds to the \u201cbad\u201d objects in the universe? If\nthey do not correspond to anything, why do we need them in the first\nplace to find the \u201cgood\u201d objects?\n\n\nIn defense of Kustaanheimo\u2019s approach it must be said that the\nconnections between infinite and finite models are usually far more\ncomplex than one expects. A finite model is not merely a scaled-down\nversion of an infinite model. Very often a different structure\nappears. As an analogy take the (infinite set of) natural numbers.\nTake a finite part, say the numbers 1 up to \\(L\\). In the finite case\nit makes sense to talk about small and large numbers compared to\n\\(L\\). This is classically not possible. So one finds additional\nstructure. Metaphorically speaking, by making things finite, a more\ndetailed or \u201cfine-grained\u201d structure appears, that is\nwiped out in the presence of infinities. Perhaps the distinction\nbetween \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d geometrical objects\nis such an additional feature that disappears in the classical\nEuclidean model. Thus perhaps the prime numbers do have a\nsignificance. But still the question remains: is this a new sort of\nPythagoreanism?
