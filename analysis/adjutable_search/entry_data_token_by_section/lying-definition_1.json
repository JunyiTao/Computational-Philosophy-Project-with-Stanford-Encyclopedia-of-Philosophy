    "main_text": "Traditional Definition of Lying || Statement Condition\n1.1 Statement Condition\n\n\nAccording to the statement condition, lying requires that a person\nmake a statement. Making a statement requires the use of conventional\nsigns, or symbols. Conventional signs, such as\n\u201cWOMEN\u201d on the door to a restroom, are opposed to natural\nor causal signs, or indices, such as women coming in and out\nof a restroom, as well as signs that signify by resemblance, or\nicons, such as a figure with a triangular dress on the door\nto a restroom (cf. Grotius 2005, 2001; Pierce 1955; Grice\n1989). Making a statement, therefore, requires the use of language. A\ncommonly accepted definition of making a statement is the\nfollowing: \u201cx states that p to y\n=df (1) x believes that there is an expression\nE and a language L such that one of the standard uses\nof E in L is that of expressing the proposition\np; (2) x utters E with the intention of\ncausing y to believe that he, x, intended to utter\nE in that standard use\u201d (Chisholm and Feehan 1977,\n150).\n\n\nIt is possible for a person to make a statement using American Sign\nLanguage, smoke signals, Morse code, semaphore flags, and so forth, as\nwell as by making specific bodily gestures whose meanings have been\nestablished by convention (e.g., nodding one's head in response to a\nquestion). Hence, it is possible to lie by these means.  If it is\ngranted that a person is not making a statement when he wears\na wig, gives a fake smile, affects a limp, and so forth, it follows\nthat a person cannot be lying by doing these things (Siegler 1966,\n128). If it is granted that a person is not making a\nstatement when, for example, she wears a wedding ring when she is not\nmarried, or wears a police uniform when she is not a police officer,\nit follows that she cannot be lying by doing these things.\n\n\nIn the case of a person who does not utter a declarative\nsentence, but who curses, or makes an interjection or an\nexclamation, or issues a command or an exhortation, or asks a question,\nor says \u201cHello,\u201d then, if it is granted that she is\nnot making a statement when she does any of these things, it follows\nthat she cannot be lying by doing these things (Green 2001,\n163\u2013164; but see Leonard 1959).\n\n\nAn ironic statement, or a statement made as part of a joke, or a\nstatement made by an actor while acting, or a statement made in a\nnovel, is still a statement. More formally, the statement condition of\nL1 obeys the following three constraints (Stokke 2013a, 41):\n\nIf x makes a statement, this does not entail\nthat x believes the statement to be true;\nIf x makes a statement, this does not entail\nthat x intends her audience to believe the statement to be\ntrue;\nIf x makes a statement, this does not entail\nthat x intends her audience to believe that x\nbelieves the statement to be true.\n\n\n\nThe statement condition is to be distinguished from a different\nputative necessary condition for lying, namely, the condition that an\nassertion be made. The assertion\ncondition is not a necessary condition for lying, according to L1. For\nexample, if Yin, who does not have a girlfriend, but who wants people\nto believe that he has a girlfriend, makes the ironic statement\n\u201cYeah, right, I have a girlfriend\u201d in response to a\nquestion from his friend, Bolin, who believes that Yin is secretly\ndating someone, with the intention that Bolin believe that he actually\ndoes have a girlfriend, then this \u2018irony lie\u2019 is a\nlie according to L1, although it is not an assertion.\n\n\nAccording to the statement condition, it is not possible to lie by\nomitting to make a statement (Mahon 2003; Griffiths 2004, 33).\nSo-called \u2018lies of omission\u2019 (or \u2018passive\nlying\u2019 (Opie 1825)) are not lies (Douglas 1976, 59; Dynel 2011,\n154). All lies are lies of commission. It is possible for a person to\nlie by remaining \u2018silent,\u2019 if the \u2018silence\u2019 is\na previously agreed upon signal with others that is equivalent to\nmaking a statement (Fried 1978, 57). However, such a lie would not be a\n\u2018lie of omission\u2019 (see People v. Meza (1987) in\nwhich, on the basis of Californian Evidence Code that\n\u201c\u2018Statement\u2019\u201d included \u201cnonverbal conduct\nof a person intended by him as a substitute for oral or written verbal\nexpression,\u201d prospective juror\u2019s Eric Luis Meza\u2019s\nsilence and failure to raise his hand in response to questions was\n\u201ctaken for a negative answer, i.e., a negative statement\u201d\n(People v. Meza 1987, 1647) and he was found guilty of\nperjury).\n\n\nNote that the statement condition, all by itself, does not require\nthat the statement be made to another person, or even that it be\nexpressed aloud or in writing. One\u2019s inner statements to oneself\nare statements, and, if other conditions are also met, can be\n\u201cinternal lies\u201d (Kant 1996, 553\u2013554).\n",
