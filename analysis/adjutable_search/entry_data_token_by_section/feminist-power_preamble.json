    "main_text": "\n\nAlthough any general definition of feminism would no doubt be\ncontroversial, it seems undeniable that much work in feminist theory\nis devoted to the tasks of critiquing gender subordination, analyzing\nits intersections with other forms of subordination such as racism,\nheterosexism, and class oppression, and envisioning prospects for\nindividual and collective resistance and emancipation. Insofar as the\nconcept of power is central to each of these theoretical tasks, power\nis clearly a central concept for feminist theory as well. And yet,\ncuriously, it is one that is not often explicitly thematized in\nfeminist work (exceptions include Allen 1998, 1999, Caputi 2013,\nHartsock 1983 and 1996, Yeatmann 1997, and Young 1992). Indeed, Wendy\nBrown contends that \u201cPower is one of those things we cannot\napproach head-on or in isolation from other subjects if we are to\nspeak about it intelligently\u201d (Brown 1988, 207). This poses a\nunique challenge for assessing feminist perspectives on power, as\nthose perspectives must first be reconstructed from discussions of\nother topics. Nevertheless, it is possible to identify three main ways\nin which feminists have conceptualized power: as a resource to be\n(re)distributed, as domination, and as empowerment. After a brief\ndiscussion of the power debates in social and political theory, this\nentry will survey each of these feminist conceptions.\n",
