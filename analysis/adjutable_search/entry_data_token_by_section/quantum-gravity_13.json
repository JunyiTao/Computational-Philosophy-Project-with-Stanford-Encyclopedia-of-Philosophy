    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues || The Planck Scale\n5.4 The Planck Scale\n\nIt is almost Gospel that quantum gravity is what happens when you\nreach the Planck scale. The standard refrain is that \u2018something\npeculiar\u2019 happens to our concepts of space, time, and causality\nat such such scales requiring radical revisions that must be described\nby the quantum theory of gravity (see, e.g., Rovelli, 2007, p. 1287).\nHowever, the arguments underlying this orthodoxy have not been\nrigorously examined. The usual motivation involves a dimensional\nanalysis argument. The scales at which theories make their mark are\nset by the values of the fundamental constants. In this way the\nconstants demarcate the domains of applicability of theories: c\ntells us when specially relativistic effects will become apparent,\n\u210f tells us when quantum effects will become apparent, and G\ntells us when gravitational effects will become apparent. As Planck\nwas able to demonstrate in 1899, these constants can be combined so as\nto uniquely determine a natural, absolute family of units that are\nindependent of all human and terrestrial baggage. The Planck length\ncan be written as\n(G\u210f/c3)\u00bd and has the\nvalue 10\u221233 in centimeters. Planck was not aware of\nthe relevance of the scale set by the constants to the applicability\nof general relativity, of course, but Arthur Eddington seems to have\nbeen aware (though getting a different value as a result of using\nOsborn Reynold\u2019s determination for the finest grain believed\npossible), writing in the March edition of Nature in 1918:\n\nFrom the combination of the fundamental constants, G, c,\nand h it is possible to form a new fundamental unit of length\nLmin = 7 \u00d7 10\u221228cm. It seems to be\ninevitable that this length must play some role in any complete\ninterpretation of gravitation. ... In recent years great progress has\nbeen made in knowledge of the excessively minute; but until we can\nappreciate details of structure down to the quadrillionth or\nquintillionth of a centimetre, the most sublime of all the forces of\nNature remains outside the purview of the theories of physics.\n(Eddington, 1918, p. 36)\n\n\nThe idea that the Planck length amounts to a minimal length in\nnature follows from the argument that if distances smaller than this\nlength are resolved (say in the measurement of the position of a\nmass), then it would require energies concentrated in a region so\nsmall that a mini-black hole would form, taking the observed system\nwith it \u2013 see Rovelli (2007, p. 1289) for this argument.\nMeschini (2007) is not convinced by such arguments, and doesn\u2019t\nsee that the case for the relevance of the Planck scale to quantum\ngravity research has been properly made. He is suspicious of the\nclaims made on behalf of dimensional analysis. There is something to\nMeschini\u2019s claims, for if the dimensional argument were true\nthen, without realising it, Planck would have stumbled upon the\nbeginnings of quantum gravity before either quantum field theory or\ngeneral relativity were devised! However, Meschini speculates that the\nfinal theory of quantum gravity \u201chas nothing to do with one or\nmore of the above-mentioned constants\u201d (p. 278). This seems too\nstrong a statement, since a core condition on a theory of quantum\ngravity will be to reduce to general relativity and quantum field\ntheory as we know it, according to limits involving these constants.\nNonetheless, Meschini is surely right that the details of these\ndimensional arguments, and the role of the Planck scale are calling\nout for a closer analysis.\n",
