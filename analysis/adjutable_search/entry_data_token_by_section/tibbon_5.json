    "main_text": "Philosophy and Exegesis\n6. Philosophy and Exegesis\n\n\nIbn Tibbon wrote two main original works: A commentary on Ecclesiastes\nand a philosophical-exegetical monograph entitled Ma\u2019amar\nYiqqawu ha-Mayim. He also wrote introductions to his\ntranslations, letters to Maimonides, and a short treatise on the\n\u201cReason for the Table and Shewbread.\u201d In addition to these\nworks, which are extant, he planned two other commentaries as well,\nwhich were never completed: A commentary on the internal meanings of\nProverbs and an esoteric commentary on Genesis, entitled Ner\nha-Hofes (see Prov 20:27).\n\n\nWhat is the character of these writings? Although they are diverse\nin form and content, they all share two main characteristics: they\ndiscuss philosophical ideas in the form of biblical exegesis; and they\nbuild upon discussions of verses and rabbinic dicta found in the\nGuide and borrow and apply methods developed by the\nGuide. Any discussion of Ibn Tibbon, therefore, needs to work\nthrough a complex philosophical-exegetical process: from the Bible,\nto rabbinic literature, to Maimonides; and from Maimonides, through\nrabbinic literature, to the Bible.\n\n\nWhy did Ibn Tibbon write his philosophy in this way? Why didn\u2019t he\nwrite straightforward philosophical or theological summas or\ncommentaries on philosophical works by Aristotle or Averroes?  In the\nthirteenth century, much of the philosophical activity in the Jewish\ncommunities was focused not on general synthesis but on translation,\ntransmission, defense, and propagation; and teaching philosophy within\nthe framework of traditional literature was a very effective way of\nspreading the ideas of philosophy. In particular, teaching philosophy\nthrough Bible (or rabbinic literature) helped make foreign ideas more\nfamiliar and helped justify the study of philosophy by connecting it\nwith authoritative exemplars. Most important, it created a safe place\nfor the doing of philosophy itself; for through a peculiar process of\ncanonization, beginning with Maimonides and continuing with his\ndisciples, specific biblical verses or stories became the standard\nloci for the discussion of philosophical ideas or problems. The\nbiblical texts would stay the same, but the philosophical ideas would\nchange, in light of the novel ideas of a particular exegete or school\nof thought.\n\n\nIn order to give a sense of Ibn Tibbon\u2019s philosophical exegesis,\nI\u2019ll briefly describe his original writings, then single out a\nfew specific examples relating to a single problem: the final aim of\nhuman existence.\n\n\n1. The Preface to the translation of Maimonides, Commentary on\nAvot\n\nIn the preface to this translation, Ibn Tibbon presents a full and\ndetailed explication of Jeremiah 9:22\u201323. He explains and criticizes\nMaimonides\u2019 explanation of these verses in Guide 3:54\nand offers his own novel interpretation, according to which the final\naim of man is knowledge and understanding of God, and nothing more\n(see further discussion below).\n\n\n2. The Commentary on Ecclesiastes\n\nIt seems that this was Ibn Tibbon\u2019s first major exegetical work;\nit was likely completed sometime between 1213 and 1221. The commentary\nis a large and digressive work, including a long preface, a\nverse-by-verse commentary, and several digressions, in which Ibn\nTibbon introduces a philosophical subject or explains a related verse\nin Genesis, Jeremiah, Psalms, Proverbs, or the Song of Songs. The\nphilosophical digressions are mainly related to logic, astronomy,\nmeteorology, generation and corruption, celestial influence on the\nsublunar world, and the soul and its faculties.\n\n\nIbn Tibbon\u2019s understanding of Ecclesiastes as a whole is as follows:\nSolomon wrote the book in his youth in order to refute ancient\nskeptics who denied the possibility of immortality (\u201cconjunction\nwith the active intellect\u201d). This he did by carefully examining\nthe arguments against immortality in order to show that they are not\n\u201ccomplete\u201d or \u201ccogent\u201d or\n\u201cdecisive.\u201d The three arguments he refutes are the\nfollowing: that human intellect is intellect in matter, and therefore\ncannot become separate from matter or contemplate separate substances;\nthat the intellect, even though it derives from an incorporeal giver\nof forms, still requires a corporeal substrate; that ethics is a first\nrather than final perfection, and cannot save the human being from\ndeath and destruction.\n\n\n3. Ma\u2019amar Yiqqawu ha-Mayim\n\nThe title of this work might be translated as: \u201cTreatise on [the\nVerse]: Let the waters be gathered (Gen 1:9)\u201d or: \u201cThe\n[Divine] Saying: Let the waters be gathered (Gen 1:9)\u201d. It was\ncompleted after the commentary on Ecclesiastes, possibly in 1221 or\n1231. Like the commentary on Ecclesiastes, it is digressive and\nexegetical, although in general it follows the order of Guide of\nthe Perplexed, part III. Ibn Tibbon begins this work with a\ncosmological question\u2014why is the earth not covered entirely by\nwater\u2014and then proceeds to answer this and related questions in\nrelation to verses from Genesis, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Job, and especially\nthe Book of Psalms.\n\n\n4. \u201cThe Reason for the Table and Shewbread\u201d\n\nThis short treatise was occasioned by a statement in Guide of the\nPerplexed 3:45. There Maimonides says that, although he can\nexplain most aspects of the sacrificial cult, he cannot explain the\nreason for the table and shewbread. Ibn Tibbon thus takes up this\nchallenge from the Master. He explains that the table and shewbread,\nand the very sensuous sacrificial cult in general, serves as a lesson\nin theology. In particular, the gross anthropomorphic representations,\nin Ibn Tibbon\u2019s opinion, expose the absurdity of conceiving God as a\nbody, with all the body\u2019s concomitant needs and relations. In other\nwords, the temple and tabernacle, working as a reductio ad absurdum of\nsorts, helped to spread the true belief in monotheism.\n\n\n5. Commentary on the Internal Meanings of Proverbs\n\nIn the commentary on Ecclesiastes, Ibn Tibbon says that he planned a\ncommentary on the internal meanings of Proverbs. Although this\ncommentary was never written, it is possible that preliminary\ndiscussions were incorporated into his other writings. Thus in the\ncommentary on Ecclesiastes, Ibn Tibbon presents a full and detailed\nverse-by-verse explication of Prov 1:1-7 and 8:22-36. The former he\nexplains as a prooemium, following the philosophical tradition of\nwriting prefaces: Solomon introduces the title of the work, the name\nof the author, the method of presentation, etc. The latter verses he\nexplains in relation to the possibility of repentance: of sinning,\nrepenting, and returning to the Garden of Eden.\n\n\n6. Ner ha-Hofes: An Esoteric Commentary on Genesis\n\nIn Ma\u2019amar Yiqqawu ha-Mayim, Ibn Tibbon refers several\ntimes to this book, which he says is a work in progress. It was never\ncompleted, but as with the commentary on Proverbs, it is possible that\npreliminary notes and explanations can be found in his other writings.\nThus, for example, the commentary on Ecclesiastes includes several\ndetailed explications of verses from Genesis, including 1:11, 1:14,\n1:20, 1:26, 3:22\u201324, 8:21\u201322. Ma\u2019amar Yiqqawu\nha-Mayim, moreover, includes one chapter devoted to Gen 28\n(Jacob\u2019s ladder), one to Gen 11 (the tower of Babel), and discussion\nthroughout regarding Gen 1 and the \u201caccount of the\nbeginning.\u201d\n",
