    "main_text": "Epistemic Sentimentalism\n5. Epistemic Sentimentalism\n\nEpistemic sentimentalists hold that (some) emotions are sources of\nmoral knowledge or at least justification. Many of them believe the\nstronger claim that emotional experiences are necessary for\ncoming to know basic moral truths, either because they are sources of\nfoundational justification or because justified moral beliefs must\ncohere with certain emotional experiences. They thus reject both\nintuitionist views, on which adequate understanding of self-evident\nmoral propositions suffices for justified belief (Audi 2013), and\nrationalist accounts according to which pure practical reason can\nyield moral knowledge. In the background are metaphysical and\nexplanatory arguments to the effect that moral truths aren\u2019t the\nsort of relations or facts that reasoning can discover (see the\n Anti-Rationalism Supplement).\n Note that this is not to deny that we can reason from basic\nmoral truths to derivative ones, or that non-moral reasoning\ncan\u2019t play a role in moral knowledge. Nor need sentimentalists\nclaim that knowledge of formal moral truths, like the transitivity of\nbetterness, is grounded in emotions.\n\nWhile epistemic sentimentalism has recently gained popularity,\nit\u2019s good to bear in mind that its main claim is somewhat\ncounterintuitive. It is a common thought that emotions can lead us\nastray in moral and prudential matters. We often come to realize\nretrospectively that we misconceived of a situation as a result of\nviewing it through the lens of jealousy, fear, or anger. It\u2019s\nnot just that emotions can lead us to act against our better judgment,\nbut they can result in false and unjustified evaluative beliefs.\n\nPhilosophers, too, have often seen emotions as epistemically\nproblematic. A very old thought that makes an appearance at least from\nPlato onwards is that they are disruptive in preventing and\nperverting rational consideration. To have this kind of effect,\nemotions need not have any cognitive content \u2013 they could just\nbe mental or bodily disturbances.\n\nMore interesting criticisms of emotion do grant that they have\ncognitive content, but maintain that they are nevertheless apt to\nmislead us. Within the Western tradition, it is the Stoics\nwho are perhaps the most famous for condemning ordinary emotions for\nthis reason. In the background was their value theory, according to\nwhich only virtue is good (and only vice bad), while worldly things\nlike illness or social success are indifferent (Long and Sedley 1987).\nSince for them, our ordinary emotions from sadness to anger and love\nare or involve judgments about the badness or goodness of worldly\nthings that are really indifferent, they are false evaluative\njudgments, or impressions to assent to false judgments. A\nstructurally similar picture is offered by Buddhists, who see\nespecially negative emotions as arising from desires for and\nattachments to things that are not of genuine worth (Flanagan\n2016).\n\nGiven these concerns with disruption and misleading, it is fair to say\nthat epistemic sentimentalists have a presumption to overcome. The\nnext sections examine some attempts to do so. The third subsection\ndiscusses the potential role of sentiments in epistemic contexts other\nthan basic justification, in particular in cases of moral\nunderstanding and the possibility of acquiring moral knowledge by\ntestimony.\n",
