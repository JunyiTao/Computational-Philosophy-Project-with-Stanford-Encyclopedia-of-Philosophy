    "main_text": "Responsibilities || Who are the Duty Bearers?\n5.4 Who are the Duty Bearers?\n\nWe can turn now to the fourth question. What kind of agent is the\nduty-bearer?\n\nIt is helpful here to focus on responsibilities to mitigate since\nthere has been considerable debate among philosophers as to whether\nindividuals have responsibilities to limit their own personal\nemissions or not. Some, like Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, are sceptical\nof the proposition that individuals have duties to limit their own\nemissions. He considers a large number of separate commonsense moral\nprinciples and argues that none of these can be marshalled to show\nthat individuals have a duty to limit their own emissions. One central\ntheme in his argument is that individuals\u2019 personal emissions\nmake no difference (Sinnott-Armstrong 2010).\n\nTwo kinds of response have been made to these kinds of arguments. The\nfirst disputes the claim that individuals make no difference. Avram\nHiller argues that \n\n\nit is prima facie wrong to perform an act which has an\nexpected amount of harm greater than another easily available\nalternative (Hiller 2011: 352) \n\n\nand argues that individual emissions, while small, violate this\nprinciple. Similarly, Broome argues that individuals\u2019 emissions\ncreate \u201cexpected harm\u201d and they have a duty not to do so\n(Broome 2019). John Nolt argues in the same vein, and calculates the\nimpact of a North Americans\u2019 emissions over their lifetime (Nolt\n2011).\n\nA second response would be to appeal to a different kind of principle.\nFor example, one might argue that we have a duty not to participate in\ncollective processes which generate unjust outcomes. To do so would be\nstand in the wrong kind of relationship to such collective processes.\nSuch a reply might seek to build on the work on\n\u201ccomplicity\u201d by Christopher Kutz (2000). In addition to a\nnegative duty not to participate in such destructive processes one\nmight also argue, as Tracy Isaacs has done, for a duty of individuals\nin \u201ccollective contexts\u201d to form associations and create\nsocial forces for change (Isaacs 2011: chapter 5 esp.\n144\u2013155).\n\nOne further comment is in order. As noted above, while\nSinnott-Armstrong believes that individuals do not have a moral\nresponsibility to limit their emissions he does believe that\nindividuals have political responsibilities to vote and to pressurise\ntheir representatives to pass climate legislation. As Hiller notes,\nthis position may be unstable. The reasons\nSinnott-Armstrong gives as to why individuals do not have mitigation\nresponsibilities (their actions are inconsequential) would, if\ncorrect, also seem to establish that they do not have political\nresponsibilities either. For one person\u2019s vote is also almost\ncertainly inconsequential (Hiller 2011: 364\u2013365).\n\nTo sum up, then, if we consider who has what\nresponsibilities to address climate change, it is helpful to\ndistinguish between four questions. First, who should engage in\nmitigation and adaptation? Second, who should bear any cost involved\nin mitigation and adaptation? Third, who has the responsibility to\nensure that the relevant duty bearers for questions 1 and 2 discharge\ntheir responsibilities? Finally, for each of the above we need to know\n\u201cwhat kind of agent is being ascribed duties?\u201d\n",
