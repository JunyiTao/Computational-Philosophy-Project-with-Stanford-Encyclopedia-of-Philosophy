    "main_text": "Abhidharma: its origins and texts || Abhidharma exegesis: from Dharma to dharmas\n1.2 Abhidharma exegesis: from Dharma to dharmas\n\nThe Buddha\u2019s discourses collected in the\n\u0100gamas/Nik\u0101yas analyze sentient experience from different\nstandpoints: in terms of name-and-form (n\u0101ma-r\u016bpa),\nthe five aggregates (Skt., skandha, Pali, khandha),\nthe twelve sense fields (\u0101yatana), or the eighteen sense\nelements (dh\u0101tu). All these modes of analysis provide\ndescriptions of sentient experience as a succession of physical and\nmental processes that arise and cease subject to various causes and\nconditions. A striking difference between the S\u016btr\u0101nta and\nthe Abhidharma worldviews is that the Abhidharma reduces the time\nscale of these processes so they are now seen as operating from moment\nto moment. Put differently, the Abhidharma reinterprets the terms by\nwhich the s\u016btras portray sequential processes as\napplying to discrete, momentary events (Cousins 1983, 7; Ronkin 2005,\n66\u201378).\n\nThese events are referred to as dharmas (Pali,\ndhammas), differently from the singular\ndharma/dhamma that signifies the Buddha\u2019s teaching(s).\nThe \u0100gamas/Nik\u0101yas use the form dharmas to convey a\npluralistic representation of encountered phenomena, i.e., all sensory\nphenomena of whatever nature as we experience them through the six\nsense faculties (the five ordinary physical senses plus mind\n[manas]). The canonical Abhidharma treatises, however, draw\nsubtle distinctions within the scope of the mental and marginalize the\ndifferences between multiple varieties of mental capacities. Within\nthis context, dharmas are seen as the objects of a specific\nmental capacity called mental cognitive awareness (Skt.,\nmanovij\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a, Pali,\nmanovi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a) that is considered the\ncentral cognitive operation in the process of sensory perception.\nMental cognitive awareness is a particular type of consciousness that\ndiscerns between the stimuli impinging upon the sense faculties and\nthat emerges when the requisite conditions come together.\nDharmas are not merely mental objects like ideas, concepts,\nor memories. Rather, as the objects of mental cognitive awareness,\ndharmas may be rendered apperceptions: rapid\nconsciousness-types (citta) that arise and cease in\nsequential streams, each having its own object, and that interact with\nthe five externally directed sensory modalities (visual, auditory,\netc.) of cognitive awareness. The canonical Abhidharma texts portray\ndharmas, then, as psycho-physical events with diverse\ncapacities by means of which the mind unites and assimilates a\nparticular perception, especially one newly presented, to a larger set\nor mass of ideas already possessed, thus comprehending and\nconceptualizing\n it.[6]\n\nUltimately, dharmas are all that there is: all experiential\nevents are understood as arising from the interaction of\ndharmas. While the analogy of atoms may be useful here,\ndharmas notably embrace both physical and mental phenomena,\nand are generally understood as evanescent events, occurrences, or\ndynamic properties rather than enduring\n substances.[7]\n The Abhidharma exegesis thus attempts to provide an exhaustive\naccount of every possible type of experience\u2014every type of\noccurrence that may possibly present itself in one\u2019s\nconsciousness\u2014in terms of its constituent dharmas. This\nenterprise involves breaking down the objects of ordinary perception\ninto their constituent, discrete dharmas and clarifying their\nrelations of causal conditioning. The overarching inquiry subsuming\nboth the analysis of dharmas into multiple categories and\ntheir synthesis into a unified structure by means of their manifold\nrelationships of causal conditioning is referred to as the\n\u201cdharma theory.\u201d\n",
