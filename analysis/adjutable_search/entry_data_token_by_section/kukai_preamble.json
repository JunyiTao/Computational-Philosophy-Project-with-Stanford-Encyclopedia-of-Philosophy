    "main_text": "\n\nK\u016bkai (774\u2013835CE) is one of the intellectual giants of\nJapan, who ought not to be ignored in any account of the history of\nJapanese thought. Among the traditional Buddhist thinkers of Japan,\nand perhaps even of the whole of East Asia, he is one of the most\nsystematic and philosophical. He is most famous for being the founder\nof Shingon esoteric Buddhism in Japan. But he is also remembered not\nonly for his contributions as a teacher and scholar of religion, but\nfor his accomplishments and innovations in social welfare, public\neducation, lexicography, language, literature and poetry, literary\ntheory, calligraphy, art, painting, wood-carving, sculpture, music,\ncivil engineering, architecture, etc. during a period when Japan was\nundergoing rapid change. In this essay, we shall restrict our account\nto his philosophy.\n",
