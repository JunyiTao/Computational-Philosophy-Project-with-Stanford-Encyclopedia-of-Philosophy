    "main_text": "Buddhist Influences and the Neo-Confucian Epistemology || Innate Knowledge\n4.5 Innate Knowledge\n\nDuring the Ming Dynasty (1368\u20131644) this epistemological split\nin Neo-Confucian philosophy manifested itself in the establishment of\ntwo divergent streams of thought, represented by the\n\u201crealist\u201d current of the School of the Structural\nPrinciple (Li xue \u7406\u5b78) on one side, and the\n\u201cidealist\u201d School of the Heart-Mind (Xin xue\n\u5fc3\u5b78) on the other. Wang Yangming, the most influential\nrepresentative of the latter, provided a crucial node in the\ninextricable link between Chinese epistemology and ethics, something\nthat is especially evident in the main concepts of his epistemological\nsystem: the ideas of heart-mind (xin), the unity of knowledge\nand action (zhi xing heyi) and innate knowledge\n(liangzhi). The latter notion represents an original, natural\ntruth in the sense of the basic recognition of the most profound\nstructure of existence. Innate knowledge is inborn and thus\nnecessarily implied in every person, forming an inseparable part of\nthe human heart-mind. In the same way as the heart-mind, of which it\nis a part, innate knowledge also contains the basic structure of\nnatural principles (li) (Wang 1933: II, 57). This basic\nepistemological concept also forms the foundation of Wang\u2019s\nethic in the sense of moral recognition, or the distinction between\ngood and evil (Wang 1933: III, 26). Thus, innate knowledge represents\nthe basic criterion for the recognition and evaluation of individual\ncomprehension, as well as social interactions. Since Neo-Confucian\nideology is based on the Mencian interpretation of ancient\nConfucianism, this unity of innate knowledge and moral goodness is\nquite unsurprising. Therefore, Wang pointed out that Mengzi, in\ncontrast to Xunzi, stressed the goodness of human nature. However,\ninnate knowledge is not merely a passive substance of ethical\ncomprehension. Through the process of \u201csuccessful\u201d\nintrospection, it also automatically leads to \u201cproper\u201d\n(and, thus, morally good) action, and can therefore provide a\ncriterion for our behavior. Here, Wang, obviously influenced by Chan\nBuddhism, tried to expand upon Mengzi\u2019s teachings, stressing\nthat the notions of good and evil are not absolute concepts, since all\nthat exists is regulated in accordance with the all-embracing and\nall-encompassing structure of the natural order of cosmic reason, and\nthus with the system of the structural, absolutely valid principles of\nnature (li) (Wang 1929: II, 29a).\n\nAccording to Wang Yangming, good and evil cannot be separated from\nhuman \u201cintention\u201d (yinian \u610f\u5ff5).\nHence, human action can only be evaluated in the context of specific\nconcrete situations. The impulse which tells us what is right\n(shi) or wrong (fei) in a particular situation is,\nonce again, the concept of innate knowledge (liangzhi). As we\nhave seen, the binary category of knowledge and action and the\nquestion of the relation between these two concepts represented one of\nthe fundamental problems of Chinese epistemology. Hence, \u201cinnate\nknowledge\u201d, the inborn capacity in which the boundary between\nknowledge and action apparently disappeared, was of utmost\nimportance.\n",
