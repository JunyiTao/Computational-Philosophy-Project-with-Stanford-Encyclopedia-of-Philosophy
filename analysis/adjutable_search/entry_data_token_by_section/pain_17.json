    "main_text": "Eliminativism about pain || The argument from reactive dissociation for eliminating pain\n6.1 The argument from reactive dissociation for eliminating pain\n\nDaniel Dennett, in his influential article, \u201cWhy You Can\u2019t\nMake a Computer that Feels Pain\u201d (1978), argued that the\nordinary concept of pain is irremediably incoherent and should be\nabandoned. His argument relied on some clinical pain syndromes which\nhe dubbed the \u201creactive dissociation\u201d of pain affect from\nits sensory aspect.\n\nIt has been well known that certain surgical procedures, some drugs\nand certain pathological conditions reduce or remove the\nunpleasantness of pain while preserving its sensory-discriminative\naspect. These data typically come from patients who have undergone\nprefrontal lobotomy (Freeman et al. 1942; Freeman and Wattz 1946,\n1950; Hardy et al. 1952; Barber 1959; Bouckoms 1994) or cingulotomy\n(Foltz and White 1962a, 1962b; White and Sweet 1969) as a last resort\nfor their intractable chronic pain (as frequently involved in phantom\nlimb pain, neuralgia, causalgia, severe psychogenic and cancer pains),\nfrom patients under the effects of hypnotic suggestion (Barber 1964;\nRainville et al. 1997, 1999), nitrous oxide (laughing gas), and some\nopium derivatives like morphine (Barber 1959). These patients by and\nlarge claim that they are in pain, and they can recognize and identify\ntheir pain as such, but do not feel or seem bothered or distressed in\nways characteristic to having pain experiences.\n\nAlthough it is usually not recognized in the literature, there are\nimportant differences among the phenomena afflicting these patients,\nwhich are manifested in patients\u2019 reports and behavior. For\ninstance, pain asymbolia also typically produces a kind of\ndissociation \u2014 a rather strong kind \u2014 sometimes similar to\ncingulotomy patients\u2019 but interestingly different from lobotomy\npatients\u2019 (Rubins and Friedman 1948; Hurt and Ballantyne 1974;\nBerthier et al. 1988, 1990; Devinsky et al. 1995; Weinstein et al.\n1995). In fact, there is evidence that pain asymbolia may be the only\nform of genuine dissociation (Grahek 2007). These patients, for\ninstance, don\u2019t react even to momentary pains like pinpricks,\nsmall cuts, or burns. Experimental pain stimuli fail to produce any\nrecognizable affective reactions. Nevertheless, the patients insist\nthat the stimuli cause pain \u2014 they identify their experiences as\npain (Rubins and Friedman 1948; Berthier et al. 1988, 1990; Dong et\nal. 1994; Weinstein et al. 1995). The lobotomy and morphine patients,\non the other hand, do show the usual affective reactions and symptoms\nwhen they are stimulated momentarily by normally painful stimuli. But\nthey don\u2019t seem to care or be bothered by their standing\npersistent or chronic pains. Probably, they still feel the negative\naffect but don\u2019t mind it, whereas the pain asymbolia patients\ndon\u2019t even seem to feel the momentary negative affect.\n\nThese two cases also need to be distinguished from so-called\ncongenital insensitivity to pain, a condition where the patients\ndon\u2019t even report any pain experience upon various kinds of\nnoxious stimuli \u2014 unfortunately these patients don\u2019t live\nlong (McMurray 1955, 1975; Baxter and Olszewski 1960; Sternbach 1963;\nBrand and Yancey\n 1993).[19]\n\nIn his paper, Dennett primarily relies on the kind of dissociation\ninvolved in lobotomy and morphine cases and treats them as if they\ninvolved the same kind of strong dissociation involved in pain\nasymbolia. He also presents certain aspects of the gate-control theory\nof pain transmission developed by Melzack and Wall which had already\nstarted to revolutionize the scientific pain research (Melzack and\nWall 1965; Melzack 1973). Inspired by this theory, he then presents a\nspeculative subpersonal functional theory of pain processing,\naccording to which pain processing occurs in many functionally (even\nanatomically) different components of the central nervous system,\nmostly in parallel, such that some of them can be selectively\nimpaired. This kind of selective impairment, he says, can produce not\nonly dissociation of the kind we are familiar with, but many more\nbizarre phenomena we can expect to find and imagine happening. His\ninsight is that our ordinary notion of pain with its essentialist\nintuitions cannot withstand the implications of such scientific\ndevelopments in pain research.\n\nAccording to the common-sense concept of pain, Dennett argues,\n\n\n(14) pain experiences are essentially painful, awful,\nabhorrent, so that it is a logical impossibility to have an\naffectively neutral pain experience.\n\n\nBut it is also part of common sense that\n\n\n(15) a subject\u2019s access to her pain experiences is essentially\n\u201cprivileged or infallible or incorrigible\u201d (1978, p.\n226).\n\n\nIn the case of reactive dissociation (RD) patients, these two main\npillars of our ordinary concept of pain come into irremediable\nconflict according to Dennett. A totally alert and conceptually\ncompetent RD patient sincerely believes that (a) she is having a pain\nexperience, and that (b) her pain experience is not painful at all.\nGiven (14) and (a), we, as well as the patient, may conclude that she\nis having a painful pain experience. But this contradicts her belief\n(b) that is guaranteed to be true given (15). So we have a\ncontradictory concept of pain, which means that nothing can be a pain\n\u2014 an object or event with essentially contradictory properties\ncannot exist. Dennett also argues that the ordinary notion of pain\nwill not survive giving up either (14) or (15). So pains, as\nordinarily understood, do not exist. This is Dennett\u2019s\neliminativism about pain.\n\nOne way to respond to Dennett\u2019s challenge is to say that if the\ncommon-sense conception of pain did indeed require (14) and (15), then\nit was simply wrong (Kaufman 1985). So strictly speaking nothing\ncorresponds to the ordinary notion of pain. But given that pain\nexperiences are almost always unpleasant (in fact, always unpleasant\nin non-pathological cases), we can easily replace the faulty\nconception with a new one which is close enough not to cause alarm by\nits being empty \u2014 read (14) with \u2018normally\u2019 instead\nof \u2018essentially.\u2019 A similar line can be run for (15).\n\nAlternatively, one can argue against Dennett that (14) and (15) are\nnot really part of the common sense concept of pain (Conee 1984,\nKaufman 1985, Guirguis 1998). Indeed when we are told the complete\ndetails of what is going on in RD cases, there is no tendency to\nconclude that pains turn out not to exist. Rather, in such cases we\nrealize that pain phenomenology may be complex: what appears to be a\nsimple and homogenous phenomenology in casual introspection turns out\nto have a complex structure in close and trained inspection\n(challenging a strict reading of (15)). Then what the RD cases show is\nthat the affective aspect is not essential for an experience to be\nclassified as pain. Indeed such a conclusion was urged by early\nintrospectionist psychologists long before the discovery of reactive\ndissociation. So we learn that the identity of pain goes with its\nsensory aspect rather than its affective aspect (as, indeed,\nPloner\u2019s 1999 case study seems to show). Surprising, yes, but\nnothing like a major conceptual confusion. But part of Dennett\u2019s\noverall point should be granted in any case: the limit of what can be\nconceptually revised or abandoned as a result of scientific\ndevelopments may be much closer to home than we ordinarily tend to\nthink.\n",
