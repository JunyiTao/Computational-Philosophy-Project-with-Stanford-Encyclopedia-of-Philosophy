    "main_text": "Phylogenetic Inference and Philosophy || Long-Branch Attraction and model based methods\n2.4 Long-Branch Attraction and model based methods\n\nIn\n section 2.3\n we mentioned that the falsificationist justification of parsimony was\nmet with a serious challenge by the discovery that it was subject to\nmaking systematic errors under certain conditions. Joseph\nFelsenstein\u2019s (1978) paper, \u201cCases in which Parsimony or\nCompatibility Methods Will be Positively Misleading\u201d first\ndescribes what came to be known as the phenomenon of\n\u201clong-branch attraction\u201d. Though hardly the beginning of\ndebates between parsimony and model-based phylogenetic methods, it\nrepresents an important inflection point in discussions about\nphylogenetic inference.\n\nLong-branch attraction refers to the tendency of some methods to\npreferentially group together long branches (those with more\nevolutionary changes) regardless of their actual history. Methods\ndesigned to identify trees requiring the fewest number of evolutionary\nchanges to explain the data will prefer explanations of shared\nancestry over convergent evolution\u2014even in cases where\nconvergent evolution occurred. For example, imagine two branches with\nrapidly evolving DNA sequences. By chance alone, the two branches\nmight have the same mutation at the same site which parsimony treats\nas evidence that these branches share a recent history. In a range of\ncases, the chances of these similar mutations occurring is so high\nthat we expect the number of these convergent cases to overwhelm the\nsignal from the true homologies. In these cases, the parsimony method\nis statistically inconsistent. A method is statistically consistent\nwhen it is guaranteed, as more data are added, to identify the correct\nsolution. Methods that fail to do this are statistically inconsistent.\nIn this case, not only does parsimony fail to be consistent, but the\nmethod reliably returns increased support for a specific, incorrect\noutcome as more data are added and hence is \u201cpositively\nmisleading\u201d.\n\nLong-branch attraction is more than just an operational problem, it\nalso challenges the falsificationist underpinnings of parsimony (Haber\n2009). Recall that on Wiley\u2019s (1975) influential account,\nphylogenetic trees are subject to being falsified as more data\n(characters) are discovered or added\n (\u00a72.3).\n If a more parsimonious tree is available to explain those data, the\npreviously most parsimonious tree is treated as falsified (or as\ncontaining more ad hoc hypotheses of homoplasy). Felsenstein\u2019s\ndiscovery was that in some circumstances, as more characters are\nincluded in a parsimony analysis, parsimony will be prone to rejecting\nhypotheses that report the actual phylogenetic relations, while\ncorroborating more parsimonious\u2014but incorrect\u2014phylogenetic\nhypotheses. This undermines the logical justification of parsimony\nanalysis.\n\nFelsenstein (1978) was (and remains) an immensely impactful paper,\ngenerating numerous research programs. It is a largely theoretical and\nabstract paper that considers how different methods perform under\ndifferent biological conditions. One natural question that might be\nposed concerns how prevalent these conditions are in the actual\nsystems being studied. This is an empirical question, of course, and\ncan be studied as such, though disputes over how to interpret\nempirical cases have proven controversial (Huelsenbeck 1997; Whiting\n1998; Siddall & Whiting 1999; Yang & Rannala 2012).\n\nIn the 1990s experimental phylogeneticists used empirical and\nsimulation studies to more rigorously empirically test claims of\nperformance of competing phylogenetic methods. This included testing\ncompeting methods to reconstruct known in-vivo phylogenies (of\nbacteriophage) that were carefully constructed, tracked, and archived\nover many generations and more complex simulated phylogenies (taking\nadvantage of the ever-growing processing power available on the lab\nbench) (Hillis, Bull, White, Badgett, & Molineux 1992; Hillis\n& Bull 1993; Hillis, Huelsenbeck, & Cunningham 1994). These\nlargely confirmed that distance and parsimony methods were subject to\nlong-branch attraction, where model-based statistical methods such as\nlikelihood avoided these epistemic traps.\n",
