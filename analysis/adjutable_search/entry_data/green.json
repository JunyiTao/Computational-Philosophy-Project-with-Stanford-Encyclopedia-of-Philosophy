    "preamble": "\n\nThomas Hill Green (1836\u201382) is widely regarded as the founding\nand most influential figure in the tradition of British idealism that\nflourished in England, especially Oxford, and Scotland, especially\nGlasgow and Edinburgh, in the second half of the nineteenth century\nand early in the twentieth century (see, e.g., Mander 2011).\nGreen\u2019s idealism was systematic, embracing metaphysics and\nepistemology, ethical theory, political philosophy, and philosophy of\nhistory and religion. In metaphysics and epistemology, Green reflected\nthe influence of Immanuel Kant, criticizing the British empiricist\nlegacy of John Locke and David Hume. Green argued that empirical\nknowledge is the workmanship of the human mind, that reality depends\non thought and cannot transcend it, and that the possibility of\nobjectivity requires the existence of a single corporate or divine\nconsciousness of which individual minds are proper parts. The only\ndefensible form of idealism, Green thought, is absolute idealism, in\nwhich all aspects of reality are operations of a single consciousness.\nIn ethics, Green embraced a form of perfectionism that identifies the\nhuman good with self-realization and the perfection of our nature as\nmoral persons and agents. But self-realization must reflect the way in\nwhich individuals participate in associations and communities and, as\na result, must reflect the demand that individuals pursue a common\ngood. In articulating this conception of perfectionism, Green sees\nhimself as synthesizing the best elements in two different ethical\ntraditions\u2014Greek eudaimonism and Kantian rationalism.\nGreen\u2019s perfectionist ethics influence his politics. He provides\nthe philosophical foundations for a new progressive form of liberalism\nthat transcends the laissez-faire liberalism characteristic of some\nstrands in nineteenth century British liberalism. The state has a duty\nto promote the common good, and individual rights are constrained by\nthe common good. This gives the state not just negative duties to\nrefrain from interfering with the freedoms and opportunities of its\ncitizens but also positive duties to provide resources and\nopportunities for individual self-realization. The ethical and\npolitical demand for self-realization, Green thinks, is freedom,\nproperly understood. He believes that moral and political progress in\nhistory consists in the gradual and increasingly more adequate\nrealization of the values of perfection, the common good, and freedom.\nBecause Green identifies God with the metaphysical, ethical, and\npolitical principles in human nature, he sees God as immanent in the\nprogressive developments in human history.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Green\u2019s Life, Works, and Influence\n\nGreen was born in Birkin, Yorkshire, April 7, 1836. His mother died\nwhen he was very young, and he was educated by his father, Valentine\nGreen, until he attended Rugby School in 1850. Green entered Balliol\nCollege, Oxford University, in 1855, where he was taught by Benjamin\nJowett and Charles Parker. Under Jowett\u2019s mentorship, Green was\nintroduced to both classical Greek and eighteenth and nineteenth\ncentury German philosophy and earned a First in Greats.\n\nGreen remained at Oxford after receiving his degree. He was appointed\nas a Lecturer in Ancient and Modern History at Balliol in 1860 and was\nelected Whyte\u2019s Professor of Moral Philosophy at Oxford in 1877,\na position he held until his death in 1882. Green was among those\nresponsible for reforming the philosophical curriculum to include\nmodern as well as ancient sources. His influence on undergraduates was\nconsiderable\u2014inspiring many students by his intellectual, moral,\nand spiritual seriousness.\n\nGreen became active in Liberal Party politics in the mid-1860s. In\n1876 he was elected to the Oxford town council; he was the first don\nto serve as a representative of the citizens rather than the\nUniversity of Oxford. His principal policy reforms concerned land\nreform, labor regulation, education, and temperance. He supported the\nIrish Land Act of 1881, which sought to secure property rights of\npeasant farmers in Ireland. In education, he argued that primary\neducation should be compulsory and state-financed. He served as an\nassistant commissioner on the Taunton Commission on Secondary\nEducation in 1865\u201366, arguing for significant reforms in\neducation to equalize opportunity for higher education. He was a\nmember of the Oxford School board and played a part in the foundation\nof the Oxford School for Boys. He was an important factor in the\nuniversity extension movement, he sought to open university education\nto women, and he advocated the use of scholarships and other subsidies\nto make a university education available to the working classes.\n\nGreen was married in 1871 to Charlotte Symonds. The Greens had no\nchildren. Never a man of robust health, Green fell ill with sepsis in\n1882 and died on March 15, just a few days before his forty-sixth\n birthday.[1]\n\nGreen published a fairly small number of articles, reviews, and\npamphlets during his lifetime. He wrote the influential critical\ncommentary on Hume\u2019s Treatise of Human Nature, which\nwas part of The Philosophical Works of David Hume, that he\nand T.H. Grose edited and published in 1874. In addition, he wrote a\nthree-part article \u201cCan There Be a Natural Science of\nMan?\u201d published in Mind in 1882, the year he died.\nThese two works reflect metaphysical and epistemological themes that\nwere incorporated into Book I of Green\u2019s Prolegomena to\nEthics, published posthumously in 1883. In addition,\nGreen\u2019s \u201cLecture on Liberal Legislation and the Freedom of\nContract\u201d was published in 1881 (Works III).\nGreen\u2019s other main philosophical works were published\nposthumously. This includes Green\u2019s most important work, the\nProlegomena to Ethics. The Prolegomena was\nsubstantially completed prior to Green\u2019s death, except for\n20\u201330 pages which he had hoped to add. At Green\u2019s\ninstructions, A.C. Bradley oversaw the Prolegomena\u2019s\npublication in\n 1883.[2]\n Other important posthumous publications include his essay \u201cOn\nthe Different Senses of \u2018Freedom\u2019 as Applied to Will and\nto the Moral Progress of Man,\u201d his Lectures on the Philosophy of\nKant, and his Lectures on the Principles of Political\nObligation (all in Works II).\n\nGreen\u2019s metaphysical, ethical, and political views were\ninfluential, especially in Britain (Nettleship 1888; Richter 1964).\nBecause Green\u2019s most important work was published posthumously,\nhis direct influence on others results largely from his teaching,\npublic lectures, and political activities. Though Green sometimes\ndespaired of his ability to present idealist principles in a clear and\nrigorous fashion, he nonetheless inspired many students and peers by\nhis intellectual, moral, and spiritual seriousness (Works V\n444\u201348,\n 485).[3]\n His metaphysical and ethical views were sympathetically received and\ndeveloped in Britain by Bernard Bosanquet, A.C. Bradley, F.H. Bradley,\nEdward Caird, R.B. Haldane, J.S. Mackenzie, J.H. Muirhead, R.L.\nNettleship, Hastings Rashdall, D.G. Ritchie, Arnold Toynbee, and\nWilliam Wallace.\n\nGreen\u2019s political influence was also significant. Beyond the\nspecific economic, political, and educational reforms for which Green\nadvocated, he had an important impact on the direction of the Liberal\nParty in Britain. His egalitarian concern with human perfection,\nespecially his insistence that laws and institutions serve the common\ngood, provided an intellectual foundation for the development of a new\nform of liberalism that required the state not simply to forbear from\ninterfering in the liberties and opportunities of its citizens but\nalso to provide various positive conditions and resources on which\ncitizens may draw in pursuing better lives. Despite significant\ndifferences among them, a number of influential figures in the New\nLiberalism can claim to be heirs of Green\u2019s political\nphilosophy, including Bosanquet, Ritchie, and L.T. Hobhouse.\n2. Idealist Metaphysics and Epistemology\n\nThe most systematic presentation of Green\u2019s idealist metaphysics\nand epistemology occurs in the first book of the Prolegomena.\nGreen introduces his metaphysical and epistemological inquiries in\nresponse to a naturalistic approach to ethical theory that he thinks\nis prominent in British moral philosophy. He associates ethical\nnaturalism with hedonism and focuses on the utilitarian tradition,\nespecially John Stuart Mill and Henry Sidgwick (PE \u00a72).\nGreen associates naturalism with a kind of empiricism that attempts to\nconstruct knowledge on the basis of the senses, uncorrupted by the\nunderstanding. But Green thinks that there can be no empirical\nknowledge without operations of the understanding and concludes that a\npurely naturalistic or empirical science of morals is impossible\n(PE \u00a78; cf. Works II 83\u201385).\n\nGreen has four main aims in the first book of the\nProlegomena. (1) He wants to reject the empiricist view that\nknowledge can be analyzed into two separable components\u2014the\ndeliverances of the senses and the operations of the\nunderstanding\u2014in which what is given by nature is real and the\ncontributions of the understanding are not (PE\n\u00a7\u00a79\u201310, 20, 70). By contrast, Green argues, even the\nsimplest experience involves operations of the understanding and\nrelations to other elements of a self-conscious mind. (2) The attack\non empiricism is supposed to support the idealist claim that nature is\nthe product of the understanding (PE \u00a720). Green\u2019s\nattack on empiricism is clearly indebted to Kant\u2019s claims in the\nCritique of Pure Reason, especially Kant\u2019s account of\nthe synthetic unity of apperception in the Transcendental Analytic.\nBut, in defending idealism, Green argues that Kant did not carry his\nidealist principles to their logical conclusion (PE\n\u00a741); he rejects the Kantian dualism of appearances and\nthings-in-themselves (PE \u00a7\u00a711, 30\u201341). (3) In\norder for the idealist to distinguish between appearance and reality,\nit is necessary to posit an \u201ceternal\u201d and\n\u201cunalterable\u201d system of relations in a self-conscious\ncorporate agent that includes the finite systems of relations\ncontained in the self-conscious minds of individual persons\n(PE \u00a7\u00a713, 26, 69). (4) Though much of the first\nbook of the Prolegomena is concerned with the role of\nself-consciousness in apparently discrete episodes of experience,\nGreen is also concerned with the role of self-consciousness in\nknowledge. Knowledge requires more than acting on appearances; it\ninvolves assenting to true appearances for good reasons. This requires\nthe ability to distance oneself from appearances and to assess the\nevidence for appearances, especially their congruence with other\nelements of consciousness. This sort of epistemic responsibility\nrequires self-consciousness.\n2.1 Empiricism and Skepticism\n\nGreen is concerned with a form of empiricism that he finds in\ncommonsense, as well as philosophical, thought (PE \u00a720).\nThough Green believes that Locke\u2019s Essay was largely\nresponsible for making empiricism philosophically influential, he\nthinks that only Hume adheres to empiricist principles consistently\n(Works I 1\u20135, 132) and that, as a result, the full\nmetaphysical and epistemological difficulties with empiricism become\nclear only in Hume\u2019s work, especially the Treatise. The\nempiricist program on which Green focuses sees all knowledge as\nresting on the deliverances of the senses. On this view, knowledge is\nbuilt up from a foundation of simple discrete sensory experiences. In\nthis sort of experience, the mind is supposed to play a purely passive\nrole. The mind can then play an active role by performing various\noperations on these simple experiences, such as combining simple\nexperiences to form complex ideas, comparing simple experiences for\nsimilarity and dissimilarity, and abstracting the common elements out\nof distinct ideas. In this tradition, reality is associated with\nsimple ideas delivered to the senses and contrasted with the\nworkmanship of the understanding and relations, which are in some\nsense conventional or mind-dependent.\n\nGreen thinks that this empiricist program suffers rot at the\nfoundations; he thinks that simple sensory experience that is not\nrelational and in which the mind plays a purely passive role is\nimpossible. All experience presupposes certain formal conceptions that\nthe subject of experience employs\u2014those of subject and object,\nsubstance and quality, cause and effect, spatiality, and temporality\n(Works I 12\u201313, 16\u201317, 40\u201341,\n43\u201350).\n\nSome sensory judgments are clearly relational, as when we perceive one\nevent A to be the cause of another B. To say that A is the cause of B\nis clearly to relate one event to another. Similarly, to say that A is\na brittle thing is to say that A does or would stand in relations of a\ncertain sort to other things with which it might come into contact.\nThis shows that such relational judgments are products of the\nunderstanding and not proper sensory judgments. Pure sensory judgments\nwould be simple and would not reflect the operation of the\nunderstanding. Perhaps they include only reports of current\nexperience, such as \u201cThis thing appears red\u201d. But Green\nbelieves that even these judgments are implicitly\nrelational\u2014\u201cimply sequence and degree\u201d\u2014and\nrequire comparison of one element of experience with another\n(PE \u00a746). To judge that something is a thing or\nsubstance in which properties inhere presumably requires assigning it\nsome diachronic stability, however limited, and this requires seeing\nit as persisting through some changes\u2014as a part of some series\nof events and not others. And to judge something red is to predicate a\nproperty of an object, but properties or universals are, for the\nempiricist, ideas formed by abstraction from our ideas of simple\nexperiences.\n\nGreen thinks that this conclusion about the relational character of\nexperience has important implications for skepticism. If the\nempiricists are right that reality is given in experience untainted by\nthe understanding, then recognition of the relational character of\nexperience would imply skepticism (PE \u00a7\u00a720, 25,\n30).\n\nGreen himself accepts the skeptical conclusion insofar as he denies\nthe possibility of empirical knowledge of objects independently of how\nthey appear to us. There can be no knowledge of perceiver-independent\nreality. But there can be knowledge of perceiver-dependent reality.\nGreen\u2019s idealism implies that this is the only defensible\nconception of reality that allows us to avoid the skeptical\nconclusion. He avoids the skeptical conclusion by denying empiricist\nassumptions about what is real.\n\nHowever, we can avoid skepticism without endorsing idealism if we\nabandon the claim that relations are the workmanship of the\nunderstanding, rather than given in experience. In particular,\nGreen\u2019s case for idealism is undermined if, as Moore and Russell\nwill later claim, relations can be given in experience and are not the\nproduct of the understanding (see Hylton 1990: 110\u2013112).\n\nGreen argues that the relational character of experience implies that\nexperience depends upon the activities of a self-consciousness agent\n(PE \u00a770). Rejecting Hume\u2019s conception of the self\nas illusory or no more than a bundle of sensations (Treatise\nI.iv.6), Green argues that cognition requires a self that is\nindependent of and prior to experience (PE \u00a716, 32).\nGreen thinks that experience of the world presupposes the operations\nof a self-conscious agent. Could the world itself be the product of a\nself-conscious mind?\n2.2 Idealism\n\nGreen recognizes that there are obstacles to this idealist conclusion\nthat account for the plausibility of empiricist and Kantian dualisms\nbetween the world of appearances and things as they are independently\nof appearance. We seem to need nature, as distinct from appearances,\nin order to account for the source or causes of our appearances and to\naccount for fallibility\u2014the possibility of error\u2014which\nseems to be a precondition of objectivity (PE \u00a7\u00a713,\n69). By contrast, the idealist, who denies a reality independent of\nappearances, seems unable to explain the source of appearances and the\npossibility of fallibility. This, Green thinks, is what leads Kant,\nwho rightly insists on the relational character of experience\n(PE \u00a733), to distinguish between phenomena\u2014things\nas they do or can appear to us\u2014and noumena\u2014things as they\nare in themselves, independently of how they appear to us (PE\n\u00a7\u00a711, 21\u20132, 30, 34).\n\nBut, like Kant\u2019s idealist critic J.G. Fichte, Green thinks that\nthis Kantian dualism is an unstable resting point between empirical\nrealism and idealism. He believes that the consistent application of\nKantian principles should lead to the rejection of\nthings-in-themselves (PE\n \u00a741).[4]\n Kant\u2019s dualism is both unacceptable and unnecessary. It is\nunacceptable, because it leaves cognitive success a mystery.\n\n\nIt leaves us without an answer to the question, how the order of\nrelations, which the mind sets up, comes to reproduce those relations\nof the material world which are assumed to be of a wholly different\norigin and nature. (PE \u00a734)\n\n\nIndeed, Green thinks that the notion of things-in-themselves is empty,\nbecause we can have no conception of things of themselves.\n\nGreen also thinks the Kantian dualism is unnecessary. The idealist can\nexplain error. We can never have access to things-in-themselves. But\nwe can have access to other appearances that, in various ways, might\nrepresent a particular appearance as anomalous. Here, we check one\nappearance by appeal to others (PE \u00a7\u00a712\u201313,\n64). On this view, we can distinguish between individual appearances\nor clusters of experiences and reality but not between reality and the\nentire system of appearances entertained by a particular mind\n(PE \u00a713). We avoid answering the question how our\nconceptions of the world come to match a world that is independent of\nthem by identifying reality and objectivity with the way it is\nconceived holistically by a self-conscious mind (PE\n\u00a7\u00a710, 13, 36\u201337, 63).\n\nGreen says that reality and the system of appearances are equally\ndependent on each other (PE \u00a736) and warns against the\nmisunderstanding of idealism that results from thinking that it\nreduces facts to ideas (PE \u00a737). In the discussion of\nthe possibility of bare sensations, he does not deny that they would\nbe facts but insists that they would be facts that would not exist for\nconsciousness (PE \u00a7\u00a748\u20139). This suggests, not\nthe metaphysical claim that facts are mind-dependent, but the\nepistemic claim that only structured experience can be the\nbasis of knowledge. However, this epistemological claim is much less\nradical than the metaphysical claim. Nor is it clear how it is\ninconsistent with Kantian dualism; it appears to reaffirm Kant\u2019s\nclaim that we can only have knowledge of appearances and not to deny\nthat there are things-in themselves. Perhaps Green\u2019s claim is\nonly that we are unable to say anything about things-in-themselves,\neven to say of them that they exist, without bringing them in relation\nto a conscious subject (PE \u00a740).\n\nBut it\u2019s not even clear that Green can distinguish himself from\nKant in this way. For Green treats the subject of consciousness as\nnoumenon, outside of space and time (PE \u00a7\u00a751, 52,\n65). The subject of consciousness is a precondition of experience but\nis completely distinct from any element of experience (PE\n\u00a732). Because the self is not given in experience, it is, Green\nthinks, outside of space and time (PE \u00a7\u00a752, 65).\nThis dualism between elements of conscious experience that are in\nspace and time and the selves or epistemic agents who are\nself-conscious and are outside of space and time resembles\nKant\u2019s own dualism between appearances and\nthings-in-themselves.\n\nOne might question Green\u2019s dualism and anti-naturalism.\nParticular episodes of conscious experience presuppose a subject of\nconsciousness that is prior to and independent of those episodes of\nconsciousness. However, this does not imply that the self is prior to\nand independent of all experience. Perhaps the self is a set or series\nof experiences. Green may seem to rule out this possibility, because\nhe distinguishes between a succession of conscious states and\nconsciousness of a succession of such states and claims that\nself-consciousness requires the latter, and not just the former\n(PE \u00a7\u00a752, 55, 62\u201365). But if conscious states\ncan take other conscious states as their objects, it is not clear why\nthe self could not be a suitably diachronically ordered and\ninterrelated set of conscious experiences. In any case, the need for a\nself that is the bearer of discrete self-conscious experiences does\nnot preclude the self from being an object of consciousness, thought,\nor knowledge. Indeed, Green\u2019s entire theoretical and practical\nphilosophy turns crucially on the possibility of self-consciousness\nand its causal role in thought and action. As we will see, important\naspects of Green\u2019s views about moral responsibility presuppose\nthat the self is not outside space and time but rather plays a\nfundamental causal role in responsible action.\n2.3 Absolute Idealism\n\nSo far, Green\u2019s idealism would seem to involve a plurality of\nlocal idealisms. Reality (or knowable reality) is the product of\nfinite self-conscious minds, with the result that there would be as\nmany realities (knowable realities) as there are finite\nconsciousnesses. Green finds such a conception of objectivity\ninsufficiently robust; objectivity requires a single inclusive and\neternal self-consciousness (PE \u00a7\u00a726, 67, 69;\nWorks II 85).\n\n\nWe must hold then that there is a consciousness for which the\nrelations of fact, that form the object of our gradually attained\nknowledge, already and eternally exist; and that the growing knowledge\nof the individual is a progress towards this consciousness.\n(PE \u00a769)\n\n\nThis corporate consciousness makes Green\u2019s version of idealism a\nversion of absolute idealism. The consciousnesses of individuals stand\nto this single corporate consciousness much as stages or parts of a\nperson\u2019s life stand to the person.\n\nGreen\u2019s main argument for this form of absolute idealism seems\nto be his concern with the possibility of error (PE\n\u00a726). Just as we must make room for the possibility of local\nerror in an individual\u2019s conscious experience, so too we have to\nallow for the possibility of systematic error within an\nindividual\u2019s conscious experience. But just as the idealist\nexplains the possibility of local individual error against the\nbackground of larger patterns in the individual\u2019s experience, so\ntoo she must explain the possibility of systematic individual error\nagainst the background of some larger pattern of experience. In order\nto find a larger pattern of experience, we must go outside individual\nconsciousness. But the experiences of other individuals cannot, as\nsuch, form part of a common and larger set of experiences. If the\ncontent and truth conditions of an individual\u2019s thoughts are\ndependent on the relations between those thoughts and other elements\nof his consciousness, then individuals, as such, would have\nincommensurable experiences and thoughts. We can block this\nrelativistic conclusion if there is a single trans-historical\ncorporate mind of which particular finite minds are proper parts. For\nthen there will be a common determinant of the content and truth\nconditions of the experiences and thoughts of different finite agents.\nGreen\u2019s view seems to be that knowledge and, hence, inquiry\npresuppose absolute idealism (PE \u00a726).\n\nMany idealist metaphysical views are responses to skeptical worries\nthat our realist conclusions about objective reality outstrip the\nnature of our evidence. The idealist responds by denying that reality\nis objective in a way that could exceed our evidence. Green\u2019s\nidealism fits this pattern. By denying that our beliefs about the\nworld concern things in themselves, independently of the way that they\ndo or can seem to us, Green denies the skeptic\u2019s gap between our\nevidence and reality.\n\nThere are various questions one might raise about this sort of\nidealism. First, one might think that the idealist response concedes\ntoo much to the skeptic. Perhaps we can and should accept a gap\nbetween our evidence and the claims for which they are evidence,\nresisting the skeptic\u2019s demand that evidence guarantee the truth\nof the propositions it supports. We can concede that our justified\nbeliefs about the world are fallible. Second, we might note that\nabsolute idealism cannot guarantee truth either, because it outstrips\nthe knowledge available to individual conscious minds. The existence\nof a corporate consciousness is something outside the conscious grasp\nof any of us individually. This is especially true, given that Green\nthinks that the corporate consciousness lies outside of space and\ntime. Third, Green can be read as offering a transcendental argument\nthat empirical knowledge is possible only on the assumption that\nabsolute idealism is true. Even if that argument were otherwise\nsuccessful, it would establish absolute idealism only if empirical\nknowledge is possible. But if absolute idealism is the price of\nempirical knowledge, then one might wonder if we do indeed have\nempirical knowledge.\n2.4 Self-Consciousness and Epistemic Responsibility\n\nMuch of the first book of the Prolegomena is concerned with\nthe role of self-consciousness in apparently discrete episodes of\nexperience in individual minds. But Green is also concerned with the\nrole of self-consciousness in knowledge. For the most part,\nnon-rational animals accept the way things appear to them\u2014their\ndoxastic impulses. If they reason, they select instrumental means to\nthe satisfaction of their desires, but they do not reason about\nwhether things are as they appear. They lack the capacity to distance\nthemselves from their appearances, to assess the credentials of their\ndoxastic impulses, and to assent to appearances for good reasons.\nBrutes may often have true appearances, but they are not\nepistemically responsible with respect to their appearances.\nOn the assumption that knowledge requires something like epistemic\nresponsibility, and not just true belief, Green argues that knowledge\nrequires self-consciousness, inasmuch as epistemic responsibility\npresupposes self-consciousness. For epistemic responsibility requires\na cognizer to be able to pose the question of whether she should\nassent to an appearance and to assess the reasons for assent by\nrelating this appearance to other elements of her consciousness.\nIndeed, any extended piece of reasoning requires consciousness of\ndifferent appearances as parts of a single system. For instance, I\nrecognize and trust the results of previous deliberations as premises\nin my present deliberations. This requires a self that is conscious of\nand synthesizes a set of appearances. On this view, knowledge\npresupposes epistemic responsibility which presupposes\nself-consciousness (PE \u00a7\u00a784, 120, 125). This link\nbetween knowledge and self-consciousness via epistemic responsibility\nis arguably the most important metaphysical claim for understanding\nGreen\u2019s ethical argument in the rest of the\nProlegomena.\n3. Idealist Ethics\n\nThe remaining three books of the Prolegomena concern issues\nin moral psychology and ethical theory. Green criticizes forms of\nethical naturalism that attempt to ground morality in a science of\ndesire and pleasure. In particular, he targets those in the\nutilitarian tradition who defend hedonism. He rejects the hedonist\nconception of motivation, arguing that moral agents have capacities\nfor practical reason that allow them to distinguish between the\nintensity and authority of their desires, to deliberate about their\ndesires, and to regulate their action in accordance with their\ndeliberations. Agents needn\u2019t act on their strongest desires;\nthey can and should act on the basis of a judgment about what it is\nbest for them to do. This, Green claims, is to act on a conception of\none\u2019s own overall good. Here, Green aligns himself with the\nGreek eudaimonist tradition, which he interprets in terms of\nself-realization. Because Green derives the demand for\nself-realization from an understanding of agency itself, he regards\nits demands as categorical, rather than hypothetical, imperatives.\nSelf-realization for Green requires self-consciousness, which requires\nproper cognizance of others. In this way, he agrees with those Greeks,\nsuch as Aristotle, who claim that the proper conception of the\nagent\u2019s own good requires a concern with the good of others,\nespecially the common good. However, Green thinks that the Greeks had\ntoo narrow a conception of the common good. It is only with\nChristianity and enlightenment philosophical views, especially Kantian\nand utilitarian traditions in ethics, Green thinks, that we have\nrecognition of the universal scope of the common good. This leads\nGreen to claim that full self-realization can take place only when\neach rational agent regards all other rational agents as ends in\nthemselves on whom his own happiness depends. In such a state, there\ncan be no conflict or competition among the interests of different\nrational agents. Green links self-realization and freedom; freedom is\nbest understood in terms of self-determination and self-realization.\nBecause Green thinks that self-realization aims at the common good, he\nthinks that freedom also aims at the common good. Green concludes that\nmoral progress consists in the gradual realization of this sort of\nfreedom, which requires the progressive realization of the common\ngood.\n3.1 Self-Consciousness and Practical Responsibility\n\nIn Book II Green picks up the theme from Book I about the role of\nself-consciousness in epistemic responsibility and explicitly makes\nthe parallel argument about the role of self-consciousness in\npractical and moral personality. Responsibility neither is threatened\nby determinism nor requires indeterminism; it requires\nself-consciousness (PE \u00a7\u00a787, 90, 106,\n109\u2013110). Moral responsibility requires capacities for practical\ndeliberation, and practical deliberation requires self-consciousness.\nNon-responsible agents, such as brutes and small children, appear to\nact on their strongest desires or, if they deliberate, to deliberate\nonly about the instrumental means to the satisfaction of their desires\n(PE \u00a7\u00a786, 92, 96, 122, 125). By contrast,\nresponsible agents must be able to distinguish between the\nintensity and authority of their desires, to\ndeliberate about the appropriateness of their desires and aims, and to\nregulate their actions in accord with these deliberations (PE\n\u00a7\u00a785\u201386, 92, 96, 103, 107, 220). Responsibility\nrequires moral personality. Here, Green shows the influence\nof Butler, Reid, and Kant (see, e.g., Irwin 1984).\n\nGreen considers the apparent threat to responsibility resulting from\nthe claim that agents necessarily act on their strongest desires\n(PE \u00a7\u00a7103\u2013106, 139\u201342). He thinks that\nthe threat is specious, because it rests on an ambiguity. Some desires\nare stronger because more intense, but desires can also be stronger\nwhen they are endorsed after deliberation. The action of non-rational\nanimals is just the vector sum of the intensity of their desires; they\ndo act on their strongest desires, in this first sense. But\nresponsible agents\u2014who have moral personality and can\ndistinguish between the strength and authority of desire and act on\nthese judgments\u2014need not act on their strongest desire in this\nfirst sense. Instead, they can be moved by the strongest desire after\ndeliberation. It\u2019s only by failing to distinguish these two\ndifferent kinds of strength, Green thinks, that one could see a threat\nto responsibility here.\n\nGreen makes clear that the sort of moral personality that is required\nby responsibility is a capacity to recognize and be guided by\nreasons. This is clear from his defense of Kant\u2019s conception of\nfreedom against criticisms. As we have seen, Green does not think that\nfreedom and responsibility require Kant\u2019s doctrine of\ntranscendental freedom. But Green is sympathetic with Kant\u2019s\nclaims about positive freedom and autonomy in the Groundwork.\nThere, Kant identifies positive freedom or autonomy with a will\ndetermined by practical reason and the moral law (4: 447). Sidgwick\ncriticizes this conception of freedom in his essay \u201cThe Kantian\nConception of Free-Will,\u201d reprinted in the Appendix to The\nMethods of Ethics, for being unable to show how someone might be\nfree and responsible for making the wrong choices, as well as the\nright ones (Methods 511\u201316). The possibility of freely\nchosen wrongdoing shows that Kant\u2019s conception of positive\nfreedom, as conformity with practical reason, cannot be freedom of the\nkind required by moral responsibility. In his lectures on Kant\u2019s\nethics, Green recognizes the same problem for Kantian freedom that\nSidgwick does (Works II\n 107).[5]\n But Green thinks that this is a case where the essentials of the\nKantian view can be defended, even if this requires amending Kant.\nKant\u2019s considered view, Green thinks, contrasts two kinds of\npositive freedom\u2014(a) the capacity to conform to\npractical reason and (b) the exercise of this capacity.\nFreedom as responsibility requires (a), not (b) (Works II\n136). On this capacitarian reading of moral personality and\nresponsibility, the person who has the capacity to conform to\npractical reason and the moral law but fails to exercise it is just as\nresponsible as the person who has the capacity and does exercise it\n(Works II 107\u201308, 119,\n 136).[6]\n\nGreen thinks that the process of forming and acting on a conception of\nwhat it is best for me on the whole to do is for me to form and act\nfrom a conception of my own overall good (PE\n\u00a7\u00a791\u201392, 96, 128).\n\n\nA man, we will suppose, is acted on at once by an impulse to revenge\nan affront, by a bodily want, by a call of duty, and by fear of\ncertain results incidental to his avenging the affront or obeying the\ncall of duty. We will suppose further that each passion \u2026\nsuggests a different line of action. So long as he is undecided how to\nact, all are, in a way, external to him. He presents them to himself\nas influences by which he is consciously affected but which are not\nhe, and with none of which he yet identifies himself \u2026. So long\nas this state of things continues, no moral effect ensues. It ensues\nwhen the man\u2019s relation to these influences is altered by his\nidentifying himself with one of them, by his taking the object of one\nof the tendencies as for the time his good. This is to will,\nand is in itself moral action \u2026. (PE \u00a7146)\n\n\nTo identify reflectively with a desire is to will it and to\nact from motive and character, rather than mere\ndesire (PE \u00a7153).\n\nHowever, we might wonder why Green assumes that in acting on some\nconception of an overall good I am thereby acting on a conception of\nmy own good.\n\n\nIt is superfluous to add, good to himself, for anything\nconceived of as good in such a way that the agent acts for the sake of\nit, must be conceived as his own good, though he may conceive\nit as his own good only on account of his interest in others, and in\nspite of any suffering on his own part incidental to its attainment.\n(PE \u00a792)\n\n\nThis may seem to confuse the ownership of the conception of\nthe good (whose conception it is) with its content (whether\nit is a conception of my good or simply of what is good). I may act on\nmy conception of the good, but that does not make it a conception of\nmy own good.\n\nHowever, Green may think that the transition from ownership to content\nis legitimate. He may think that when one adopts an end as good and\nstructures one\u2019s plans, emotions, and desires around it that one\nthereby makes that end one\u2019s own and makes it part of\none\u2019s personal good such that the value of the end and\none\u2019s success in achieving it determine in part the quality of\none\u2019s life. If I choose to become a parent, then the\nconstitutive aims of being a good parent, including the success of my\nchildren, become part of my good such that the well-being of my\nchildren directly affects my own happiness or personal good.\n3.2 Self-Realization and Normative Perfectionism\n\nGreen develops his ideas about the personal good in Book III of the\nProlegomena. There he criticizes hedonism and develops his\nown perfectionist claims. Hedonism can be a psychological doctrine or\nan evaluative doctrine about the personal good. Green\u2019s\ndiscussion of hedonism focuses on the utilitarian tradition,\nespecially the views of Mill and Sidgwick. Green thinks that Mill\ncombines psychological and evaluative hedonism, though that is\ndisputable (Brink 2013: chs. 2\u20133). Sidgwick clearly\ndistinguishes the two forms of hedonism, rejecting psychological\nhedonism and defending evaluative hedonism. Since Sidgwick explicitly\naccepts evaluative hedonism while rejecting psychological hedonism,\nGreen must argue differently against Sidgwick.\n\nGreen agrees with Butler that psychological egoism (hedonism) is\nimplausible but thinks that people mistakenly accept it because they\nmistake the pleasure that can be expected to attend the satisfaction\nof desires for the object of desire. Because the pleasure is\nconsequential on the satisfaction of desire, the object of desire\ncannot be that pleasure. This point is relevant, Green thinks, to\nMill\u2019s alleged evaluative hedonism (PE\n\u00a7\u00a7162\u201369). Green notes that in Mill\u2019s higher\npleasures doctrine and in the proof that Mill seems to assign\nintrinsic value to objective pleasures, that is, to activities and\npursuits that exercise our higher capacities. Green thinks that these\nclaims about the superior value of such activities are\nanti-hedonistic, but he thinks that Mill fails to see this only\nbecause he focuses on the (subjective) pleasure that is expected from\nengaging in such activities. But this confuses, Green thinks, what we\nvalue and a by-product of what we value.\n\nGreen focuses on Mill\u2019s explanation of the preferences of\ncompetent judges for modes of existence that employ their higher\nfaculties. Higher pleasures are those things (e.g., activities) that a\ncompetent judge would prefer, even if they produced less pleasure in\nher than the lower pleasures would (Mill Utilitarianism II 5\nin Works X 211). But why should competent judges\nprefer activities that they often find less pleasurable unless they\nbelieve that these activities are more valuable? Mill explains the\nfact that competent judges prefer activities that exercise their\nrational capacities by appeal to their sense of dignity\n(Utilitarianism II 5 in Works X 212). Green thinks\nthat the dignity passage undermines hedonism (PE\n\u00a7164\u201366, 171). In claiming that it is the dignity of a life\nin which the higher capacities are exercised and the competent\njudge\u2019s sense of her own dignity that explains her preference\nfor those activities, Mill implies that her preferences reflect\njudgments about the value that these activities have independently of\ntheir being the object of desire or the source of pleasure. We take\npleasure in these activities because we recognize their value; they\nare not valuable, because they are pleasurable.\n\nGreen not only criticizes the evaluative hedonism he finds in Mill; he\nalso rejects evaluative hedonism outright. One argument he makes is\nthat evaluative hedonism is actually inconsistent with psychological\nhedonism. Evaluative hedonism says that our ultimate aim ought to be\nto maximize net pleasure or to seek the largest sum of pleasures,\nwhereas psychological hedonism claims that pleasurable experience is\nthe ultimate object of desire. But a sum of pleasures is not itself a\npleasure, and so, according to psychological hedonism, we could not\nact on the requirements of evaluative hedonism (PE\n\u00a7221). This may be a problem for someone who combines both\nevaluative and psychological hedonisms. However, this is not a problem\nfor an evaluative hedonist such as Sidgwick who eschews psychological\nhedonism (PE \u00a7\u00a7222, 334, 351). Green must offer\nsome other argument against the person who thinks a self-conscious\nagent would identify his personal good with pleasure. Green\u2019s\nreal disagreement with Sidgwick concerns whether the only things\nreflectively desirable for an agent are her own states of\nconsciousness. Green recognizes \u201cideal goods\u201d for an agent\nthat involve her own activities and her relations to other members of\nher community (PE \u00a7\u00a7159\u201361, 357; cf.\nMethods 113\u201315).\n\nGreen argues not only against hedonism but also for self-realization.\nHe suggests that it is the very capacities that make moral\nresponsibility possible in the first place that determine the proper\nend of deliberation (PE \u00a7176). Responsible action\ninvolves self-consciousness and is expressive of the self. The self is\nnot to be identified with any desire or any series or set of desires;\nmoral personality consists in the ability to subject appetites and\ndesires to a process of deliberative endorsement and to form new\ndesires as the result of such deliberations. So the self essentially\nincludes deliberative capacities, and if responsible action expresses\nthe self, it must exercise these deliberative capacities. This\nexplains why Green thinks that the proper aim of deliberation is a\nlife of activities that embody rational or deliberative control of\nthought and action (PE \u00a7\u00a7175, 180, 199, 234,\n238\u201339, 247, 283).\n\nOne can ask about any conception of the good why one should care about\nthe good, so conceived. Why should the good, so conceived, be\nnormative? Green\u2019s defense of self-realization makes the content\nof the good consist in the exercise of the very same capacities that\nmake one a rational agent, subject to reasons for action, in the first\nplace. This promises to explain why a rational agent should care about\nthe good conceived in terms of self-realization.\n\nThis justification of self-realization also explains why Green treats\nthe imperative of self-realization as a categorical imperative. Like\nKant, Green seeks an account of the agent\u2019s duties that is\ngrounded in her agency and does not depend upon contingent and\nvariable inclinations. The goal of self-realization, Green thinks,\nmeets this demand.\n\n\nAt the same time, because it [self-realization] is the fulfilment of\nhimself, of that which he has in him to be, it will excite an interest\nin him like no other interest, different in kind from any of his\ndesires and aversions except such as are derived from it. It will be\nan interest as in an object conceived to be of unconditional value;\none of which the value does not depend on any desire that the\nindividual may at any time feel for it or for anything else, or on any\npleasure that \u2026 he may experience\u2026.[T]he desire for the\nobject will be founded on a conception of its desirableness as a\nfulfilment of the capabilities of which a man is conscious in being\nconscious of himself. \u2026 [Self-realization] will express itself\nin [the] imposition \u2026 of rules requiring something to be done\nirrespectively of any inclination to do it, irrespectively of any\ndesired end to which it is a means, other than this end, which is\ndesired because conceived as absolutely desirable. (PE\n\u00a7193)\n\n\nBecause the demands of self-realization depend only on those very\ndeliberative capacities that make one a responsible agent, they are\ncategorical imperatives.\n\nGreen recognizes that his conception of the good in terms of\nself-realization and perfection is abstract and perhaps vague in\ncomparison with the apparent definiteness of the hedonist\u2019s\nconception of the good (PE \u00a7193). Nonetheless, his\nconception of the good in terms of self-realization or the exercise of\ndeliberative capacities is not empty.\n3.3 Self-Realization and the Common Good\n\nIn particular, Green links self-realization and a common good. He\nbelieves that full self-realization can take place only in a community\nof ends (PE \u00a7\u00a7183\u201384, 190\u201391, 199, 232)\nin which each person cares about others for their own sakes\n(PE \u00a7\u00a7199\u2013200) and aims at a common good\n(PE \u00a7202, 236). But why? At one point, Green suggests\nthat this concern for others, at least for those within one\u2019s\nimmediate circle, is given or natural.\n\n\nNow the self of which a man thus forecasts the fulfilment, is not an\nabstract or empty self. It is a self already affected in the most\nprimitive forms of human life by manifold interests, among which are\ninterests in other persons. These are not merely interests dependent\non other persons for the means to their gratification, but interests\nin the good of those other persons, interests which cannot be\nsatisfied without the consciousness that those other persons are\nsatisfied. The man cannot contemplate himself as in a better state, or\non the way to the best, without contemplating others, not merely as a\nmeans to that better state, but as sharing it with him. (PE\n\u00a7199)\n\n\nGreen might simply be invoking this familiar concern that one has for\none\u2019s intimate associates. If I do care about the welfare of my\nassociates, and these desires survive deliberative endorsement, then,\naccording to Green, I make their welfare part of my own personal good\n(PE \u00a7\u00a791\u201392). But this may make an\nagent\u2019s interest in others dependent on her contingent desires.\nTo explain how the demands of the common good are categorical\nimperatives, we need to explain how pursuit of a common good is an\ningredient in self-realization.\n\nGreen claims that a rational agent\u2019s interest in others is\nrooted in her search for a \u201cpermanent\u201d good (PE\n\u00a7\u00a7223, 229\u201332, 234). Moral personality requires\nimpulse control and the abilities to distinguish myself from my\nappetites and to frame the question what it would be best for\nme\u2014a temporally extended agent\u2014on the whole to do. This\nwill involve endorsing some goals as good and as worth making\nshort-term sacrifices or investments for. This is to value goals and\nprojects in which I am involved that have some degree of permanence.\nGreen seems to think that the right sort of association with others\nextends this permanence in a natural way\u2014indeed, that it\nprovides a kind of counter-balance to mortality or surrogate for\nimmortality.\n\n\nThat determination of an animal organism by a self-conscious\nprinciple, which makes a man and is presupposed by the interest in\npermanent good, carries with it a certain appropriation by the man to\nhimself of the beings with whom he is connected by natural ties, so\nthat they become to him as himself and in providing for himself he\nprovides for them. Projecting himself into the future as a permanent\nsubject of possible well-being or ill-being\u2014and he must so\nproject himself in seeking for a permanent good\u2014he associates\nhis kindred with himself. It is this association that neutralises the\neffect which the anticipation of death must otherwise have on the\ndemand for a permanent good. (PE \u00a7231)\n\n\nSelf-realization involves a kind of quest for intrapersonal\npermanence. In the intrapersonal case, I preserve myself when the\nactions and intentional states of a future self depend in the right\nway on the actions and intentional states of my present and past\nselves. But interpersonal association involves deliberative\nconnections between associates, in which the intentional states and\nactions of each depend on those of the other. This might explain why\nGreen thinks self-realization aims at interpersonal permanence as\nwell. I more fully realize my capacities in association with others,\nand this association gives me reason to treat the good of my\nassociates as part of my own good.\n\nIn linking moral virtue with pursuit of a common good, Green accepts\nAristotle\u2019s claims about the importance of the fine\n(kalon) and the common good to an agent\u2019s own\neudaimonia or happiness (Irwin 1992, 2009:\n\u00a7\u00a71242\u20131244). Though Green sees the Aristotelian roots\nof his own perfectionism, he does not accept Aristotle\u2019s account\nof the scope of the common good. Whereas Aristotle\u2019s\npolitics recognize significant restrictions on the scope of the common\ngood excluding slaves and women (Politics II 4\u20137,\n12\u201313), Green thinks its scope should be universal (PE\n\u00a7\u00a7205\u201317, 249, 253, 271, 285).\n\n\nThe idea of a society of free and law-abiding persons, each his own\nmaster yet each his brother\u2019s keeper, was first definitely\nformed among the Greeks, and its formation was the condition of all\nsubsequent progress in the direction described; but with them \u2026\nit was limited in its application to select groups of men surrounded\nby populations of aliens and slaves. In its universality, as capable\nof application to the whole human race, an attempt has first been made\nto act upon it in modern Christendom. (PE \u00a7271)\n\n\nGreen\u2019s own conception of the common good is universal; full\nself-realization and the securing of a really permanent good occurs\nonly when each person respects the claims made by other members of a\nmaximally inclusive community of ends (PE \u00a7\u00a7214,\n216, 244, 332). In this respect, Green\u2019s belief that eudaimonism\ncan and should support cosmopolitan concern for others is perhaps\ncloser to the Stoic than the Aristotelian conception of the common\ngood (see Brink 2018).\n\nGreen associates this cosmopolitan conception of the common good with\nEnlightenment ethical conceptions, in particular, Kantianism and\nutilitarianism. He regards the philosophical and political influence\nof utilitarian and Kantian conceptions of impartiality as progressive\ninfluences (PE \u00a7\u00a7213\u201314). According to the\nutilitarian conception, everyone should count for one and no one for\nmore than one (PE \u00a7213). According to the Humanity\nformula of Kant\u2019s Categorical Imperative, one must treat\nhumanity, whether in your own person or in others, always as an end in\nitself and never merely as a means (PE \u00a7214). Though\nGreen thinks both utilitarian and Kantian conceptions of impartiality\nare right to insist on the wide scope of the common good, Green\naccepts the distributed concern with each moral person that he\nassociates with Kant\u2019s Humanity formula of the Categorical\nImperative (PE \u00a7\u00a7215, 217).\n\nGreen thinks that we each have reason to promote this sort of\ncosmopolitan conception of the common good. But he goes further,\nclaiming that the common good involves no conflict between the good of\nthe agent and the good of others (PE \u00a7244).\n\nBecause Green thinks that self-realization aims at the common good, a\nnoncompetitive conception of the common good is a substantive and\ncontroversial commitment. We may wonder if there are any genuinely\nnoncompetitive goods, such that one person can\u2019t enjoy them\nunless all others do. And even if there are genuinely noncompetitive\ngoods, we might doubt that the personal good would be exhausted by\nsuch a common good. If we think of the personal good as that which an\nindividual has reason to want in itself for her own sake, it seems\nplausible that the personal good and the good of others will overlap\nbut not coincide perfectly.\n3.4 Self-Realization and Freedom\n\nFreedom is not a concept that looms large in Green\u2019s\nperfectionism in the Prolegomena. However, Green focuses on\nfreedom in the posthumously published essay \u201cOn the Different\nSenses of \u2018Freedom\u2019 as Applied to Will and the Moral\nProgress of Man\u201d (Works II), where he defends a\ntripartite conception of freedom.\n\nJuridical Freedom\nMoral Freedom\nReal or Perfect Freedom\n\n\nJuridical freedom is the absence of compulsion or restraint\nby others. This is freedom as non-interference prized by Locke and\nother liberals. Moral freedom is the sort of freedom required\nfor responsibility, which is manifested in both praiseworthy and\nblameworthy conduct. Moral freedom, Green believes, requires the\ncapacity for reasons-responsiveness. This is the kind of freedom he\nproposes as a response to the problem Sidgwick identifies for Kant.\nReal or perfect freedom exists insofar as an agent exercises\nher moral freedom properly, pursuing her own personal good and its\nconstitutive commitment to the common good. This sort of freedom just\nis self-realization or the perfection of one\u2019s agency.\n\nThough each form of freedom is valuable, both juridical and moral\nfreedom are subordinate to real and perfect freedom (Works II\n308\u201309). Real freedom is the regulative ideal of agency and\ncannot be achieved without juridical and moral freedom, but neither\nare sufficient to produce real freedom (Works II 324). Green\nends up endorsing a version of the Hegelian view that freedom is a\nmatter of degree, and moral progress can be understood as the\nprogressively more perfect realization of real freedom (Works\nII\n 324\u201330).[7]\n\nIn \u201cTwo Concepts of Liberty\u201d Isaiah Berlin famously\ndistinguishes between negative and positive liberty\nand criticizes various conceptions of positive freedom, including\nGreen\u2019s (1958: 132\u201333, 141\u201354). Negative liberty,\nfor Berlin, is focused exclusively on the absence of external\ncompulsion by other individuals or the state. By contrast, positive\nfreedom involves self-determination in which the rational part of\none\u2019s soul is controlling. The rational self is the true self,\nand the true self is realized in the perfection of one\u2019s\nrational nature (1958: 131\u201334, 141\u201353). Berlin thinks that\npositive freedom is pernicious, because true freedom is negative\nfreedom and because positive freedoms smuggle other alleged moral\ngoods in under the guise of freedom, leading us to ignore the costs to\nfreedom that pursuit of these goods involves.\n\nBut Berlin\u2019s criticisms misunderstand Green\u2019s claims about\nfreedom. For Green, negative liberty as noninterference is embodied in\njuridical freedom, and juridical freedom is an important and\nlegitimate part of freedom. But juridical freedom does not exhaust\nfreedom for Green, as it does for Berlin. He puts the point this way\nin \u201cLiberal Legislation\u201d\n\n\nThus, though of course there can be no freedom among men who act not\nwillingly but under compulsion, yet on the other hand the mere removal\nof compulsion , the mere enabling a man to do as he likes, is in\nitself no contribution to true freedom. (Works III 371)\n\n\nGreen also recognizes moral freedom and real or perfect freedom. Moral\nfreedom is the capacity for reasons-responsive conduct, and real or\nperfect freedom is the proper exercise of this capacity, resulting in\nself-realization and its commitment to the common good. These forms of\nfreedom involve positive freedom.\n\nGreen believes that juridical freedom, moral freedom, and real or\nperfect freedom all involve aspects of self-determination\n(\u201cFreedom,\u201d Works II 315\u201316). Both\njuridical freedom and moral freedom are essential to responsibility.\nResponsibility depends on an agent\u2019s normative capacities and\nher opportunity to exercise them free from undue interference with\nothers. We can see this because significant impairment of either the\nagent\u2019s capacities or her opportunities is excusing. Whereas\njuridical freedom depends on the agent\u2019s opportunities, moral\nfreedom depends on her capacities. If so, then self-determination as\nresponsibility requires both juridical and moral freedoms.\n\nIf self-determination involves determination by my rational self, then\nit requires self-realization and real freedom. Here, we should\nremember Green\u2019s Kantian claim that rational nature provides not\nonly the ground of duty but also its content. Moral personality and\nfreedom involve a will that has reasons-responsive capacities. But\nthen self-determination should be expressed in activities that reflect\nand realize these rational capacities (PE \u00a7\u00a7175,\n180, 199, 234, 238\u201339, 247, 283). Full or complete\nself-determination requires not just the capacity to be guided by\nreasons but this aretaic sense of self-determination. On Green\u2019s\nview, this kind of self-determination and self-realization involve a\nconstitutive commitment to a cosmopolitan concern for the common\ngood.\n4. Idealist Politics\n\nGreen\u2019s political philosophy is expressed in his posthumously\npublished Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation\nand his 1881 essay \u201cLiberal Legislation and Freedom of\nContract\u201d. His perfectionist ethics influence his politics. He\nprovides the philosophical foundations for a new progressive form of\nliberalism that transcends the laissez-faire liberalism characteristic\nof some strands in nineteenth century British liberalism (Nicholson\n1990). The state has a duty to promote the common good, and individual\nrights are constrained by the common good. This gives the state not\njust negative duties to refrain from interfering with the freedoms of\nits citizens but also positive duties to provide resources and\nopportunities for individual self-realization.\n4.1 Rights and the Common Good\n\nGreen\u2019s Lectures on the Principles of Political\nObligation discuss a number of issues in political philosophy and\njurisprudence, including the adequacy of social contract\njustifications of the nature and limits of state authority, the nature\nof rights, the right to private property, and the justification of\npunishment. Most relevant to understanding Green\u2019s distinctive\nperfectionist conception of liberalism is his conception of\nrights.\n\nGreen\u2019s focus on political obligation concerns the nature and\nlimits of the state\u2019s enforceable demands on its\ncitizens (LPPO \u00a7\u00a71, 12). Social contract theory\nseeks to anchor political obligation in agreement, whether actual or\nhypothetical. Green discusses the social contract theories of Spinoza,\nHobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. Though critical of social contract theory\nin general, he is especially critical of Hobbes and expresses sympathy\nwith important elements in Locke and Rousseau.\n\nGreen\u2019s criticisms of social contract theory reflect his\nconception of rights. According to Green, rights are claims that\nindividuals possess to those powers that are socially recognizable as\ncontributing to a common good (LPPO \u00a7\u00a725\u201326,\n113\u2013115, 138, 143). In particular, Green thinks that my rights\nagainst others to certain normative powers are conditional on my\nrecognition that others possess rights to these same powers against me\n(LPPO \u00a7138). Green rejects the idea of natural rights as\nrights prior to society but accepts the idea of natural rights as\nprior to and independent of the positive rights established by\npolitical association (LPPO \u00a7\u00a79, 16, 30).\n\nThis conception of rights leads Green to be skeptical of attempts to\nexplain how rights might emerge from a pre-social state of nature.\nHobbes is Green\u2019s primary target here, because Hobbes views the\nstate of nature as an anti-social condition involving the war of all\nagainst all (Leviathan XIII 8\u20139) and claims that\nindividual rights, or at least individual rights to anything other\nthan non-interference, are possible only when individuals agree to\nleave the state of nature and transfer powers to a sovereign\n(Leviathan XIII 10, 13; XIV 1; XV 3). Green is skeptical in\ntwo ways. First, he doesn\u2019t see how agreement could establish\npolitical obligation if there are no moral duties in the state of\nnature (LPPO \u00a746). If the sovereign is necessary to make\npromises binding, then we can\u2019t explain how the sovereign could\nhimself arise out of binding pre-political compact. Second,\nGreen\u2019s conception of rights leads him to deny the Hobbesian\nclaim that rights and duties depend on the existence of the sovereign.\nRights depend on the common good, and there are facts about the common\ngood prior to political association and positive right.\n\nGreen\u2019s criticisms of Hobbes apply less clearly to Locke and\nRousseau. Locke\u2019s state of nature, though pre-political, is not\nanti-social, and Locke recognizes duties and rights in the state of\nnature (Treatises II.ii.6; II.i.14; II.iii.16\u201321;\nII.vi.57). For Locke, the transition from the state of nature to civil\ngovernment is to facilitate the more reliable and efficient protection\nof natural rights, the protection of property, and the promotion of\nthe public good, all of which are moral demands within the state of\nnature (Treatises II.vii.85; cf. LPPO\n\u00a7\u00a755\u201358).\n\nGreen has even more in common with Rousseau. Rousseau sees the problem\nof political obligation as one of reconciling political association\nand its constraints with individual autonomy. The state of nature is a\npre-political state but one in which individuals are socially\ninterdependent. The problem is to\n\n\nFind a form of association which defends and protects with all common\nforce the person and goods of each associate, and by means of which\neach one, while uniting with all, nevertheless obeys only himself and\nremains as free as before. (Social Contract I.vi.4)\n\n\nThe solution to this problem is for individuals to submit to\nconstraints embodied in forms of association and institutions that are\nregulated by the general will (SC I.vi.9; II.i.1). The\ngeneral will is distinct from the will of all (SC I.vi.7;\nII.iii2) and concerns the common good\u2014those basic interests of\nmoral persons that must be respected and protected for all\n(SC II.iii.1\u20132; II.iv.5; II.xi.1\u20132). Green agrees\nwith Rousseau that the general will, understood as the common good, is\na source of rights and that these rights are conditional on a kind of\nmutual recognition among members of\n society.[8]\n\nGreen disagrees with those strands in social contract theory that see\nconsent to live in political society as the source of rights. He\nthinks that rights are grounded in the common good and mutual\nrecognition and so predate any social contract. In assessing\nGreen\u2019s criticisms of social contract theory, one must assess\nGreen\u2019s own conception of rights. Are rights grounded in the\ncommon good, and do rights require social recognition in some way?\n\nIt seems we do need to ground rights in some way. Grounding them in\nthe common good seems promising, though we won\u2019t know what\nrights this conception supports without knowing more about the content\nof the common good. Insofar as the common good is one in which people\npartake equally insofar as they are moral persons, this conception\nseems likely to support a conception of equal rights to those\nconditions necessary for developing and exercising moral powers of\npersons as agents. These claims about the content of the common good\nare reflected in Green\u2019s brand of perfectionist liberalism.\n\nMust such rights be socially recognized? Even if social recognition\nallows Green to distinguish natural and legal right, we might wonder\nif he can distinguish between natural rights and duties and rights and\nduties recognized by positive morality (see, e.g., Ross 1930:\n50\u201352). The social recognition thesis may seem to preclude\nmaking sense of minority rights or unrecognized rights. Green\naddresses this issue and makes two replies, which clarify the social\nrecognition thesis (LPPO \u00a7\u00a7137\u2013147). First,\nhe does not claim that particular rights need to be the object of\nsocial recognition. It is rather that rights must be contributory to a\ncommon good that is the object of mutual recognition. My claim to\nrespect and rights are conditioned on my recognition that others have\nthe same claim to respect and rights, because we are equally moral\npersons (LPPO \u00a7\u00a7138; cf. Hinton 2001). Still, this\nclaim might suggest that individuals lack rights if others do not\nrecognize them as equal moral persons, and this might seem to imply a\nform of moral conventionalism or parochialism, which would be at odds\nwith Green\u2019s own cosmopolitanism. For this reason, it is\nimportant that Green insists that the sort of social recognition that\nrights require is potential, rather than actual,\nrecognition.\n\n\nThe condition of its [a right\u2019s] being so claimable is that its\nexercise should be contributory to some social good which the public\nconscience is capable of appreciating, not necessarily one which in\nthe existing prevalence of private interest can obtain due\nacknowledgement, but still one of which men in their actions and\nlanguage show themselves to be aware. (LPPO \u00a7143)\n\n\nIn this way, Green recognizes that slaves have natural rights to\nfreedom that are violated, even in societies in which slavery is\nsocially condoned (LPPO \u00a7140). Provided that others are\ncapable of recognizing someone\u2019s common humanity, their failure\nto do so is no obstacle to the recognition of the rights of\nothers.\n4.2 Progressive Liberalism\n\nLike Mill, Green is committed to liberal essentials\u2014a largely\nsecular state, democratic political institutions in which the\nfranchise is widespread, private property rights, market economies,\nequal opportunity, and a variety of personal and civic liberties. Also\nlike Mill, Green is a perfectionist liberal, who thinks that the\njustification of liberal essentials is grounded in a conception of the\ncommon good that understands the good of each in terms of\nself-realization.\n\nGreen\u2019s perfectionist liberalism was influential in the\nformation of a New Liberalism in late 19th century Britain\n(e.g., Richter 1964; Nicholson 1990; Brink 2003: \u00a7XXIV). The Old\nLiberalism was concerned with negative liberty and sought to undo\nstate restrictions on liberties and opportunities and was expressed in\nthe repeal of the Corn Laws, opposition to religious persecution, and\nseveral electoral reforms that extended the scope of the franchise to\ninclude the rural and urban poor. By contrast, the New Liberalism\nthought that the defense of liberty and opportunity had to be\nsupplemented by social and economic reforms in labor, health, and\neducation to address the effects of social and economic inequality\n(e.g., Freeden 1978; Nicholson 1990: ch. 5; Simhony and Weinstein\n2001). Green was viewed by many as an important intellectual source\nfor the New Liberals. He supported\n\nregulation of labor contracts to limit workplace hours and factory\nconditions (Works II 515; III 365\u201369, 373),\nmeasures to provide greater opportunities for agricultural workers\nto own land (Works II 515, 532\u201334; III\n377\u201382),\npublic health and safety regulations (Works II 515; III\n373\u201374),\neducation reforms, improving access to elementary, secondary, and\nhigher education, regardless of socioeconomic status (Works\nII 515; III 369, 387\u2013476; V 285\u201386, 326\u201328),\nand\nthe improvement of educational and economic opportunities for\nwomen (PE \u00a7267; Works V 326\u201328).\n\n\nGreen\u2019s liberalism is a perfectionist liberalism in which the\nstate aims to promote the self-realization of its citizens, and this\ngives the state a number of positive duties in relation to its\ncitizens. But the importance of autonomy to self-realization means\nthat the state\u2019s positive role is restricted to\nenabling its citizens to perfect themselves.\n\n\n[I]t is the business of the state, not indeed directly to promote\nmoral goodness, for that, from the very nature of moral goodness, it\ncannot do, but to maintain the conditions without which a free\nexercise of the human faculties is impossible. (\u201cLiberal\nLegislation,\u201d Works III 374)\n\n\nGreen\u2019s claim here bears comparison with Kant\u2019s insistence\nin the Metaphysics of Morals on a self/other asymmetry in\nwhich we must aim at our own perfection but at the happiness, rather\nthan the perfection, of others. In explaining this asymmetry, Kant\nwrites:\n\n\nSo too, it is a contradiction for me to make another\u2019s\nperfection my end and consider myself under an obligation to\npromote this. For the perfection of another human being, as a\nperson, consists just in this: that he himself is able to set\nhis end in accordance with his own conception of duty; and it is\nself-contradictory to require that I do (make it my duty to do)\nsomething that only the other himself can do. (6: 386)\n\n\nGreen makes sense of Kant\u2019s admonitions against aiming at the\nperfection of another by interpreting them as constraints on\nhow we aim at the perfection of others (Brink 2019:\n12\u201315). Given the role of one\u2019s own agency in one\u2019s\nperfection, I can\u2019t perfect others any more than I can win\ncompetitive races for them. But just as I can help another to win a\nrace by training with her, discussing strategy, and sharing\nnutritional tips, so too I can help others perfect themselves by\nhelping them develop their normative competence and deliberating with\nthem, identifying options, discussing the comparative merits of these\noptions, and providing them with opportunities to exercise their\nnormative powers. I can help others perfect themselves, just not in\nways that bypass their agency. In this way, the state can and should\npromote the self-realization of its citizens by enabling, rather than\ncoercing, them.\n\nThough the Old Liberals see themselves as the advocates of freedom,\nGreen thinks that the New Liberals have a claim to beings liberals in\nthe fullest sense, because only a mix of negative and positive reforms\ncan enable the perfection and self-realization of its citizens and,\nhence, true freedom.\n5. Idealist Religion and History\n\nGreen had profoundly moralized conceptions of religion and history.\nBoth conceptions were influenced by his idealist metaphysics and\nethics.\n\nGreen was a deeply religious person, but his conception of\nChristianity was unorthodox and animated by moral and humanistic\nprinciples. He was raised in the Evangelical faith by his father, an\nEvangelical minister. At Balliol, his religious sensibility was shaped\nin part by Jowett, who sought to present fundamental Christian\nprinciples in a contemporary and rational idiom, free of superstition,\nritual, and dogma. Jowett\u2019s example shaped Green\u2019s\ndeveloping conception of a form of Christianity that admits of\nrational philosophical reconstruction, that denies the literal\nsignificance to miracles or other supernatural events described in the\nBible, and that finds Christianity\u2019s best expression in social\nand political service in pursuit of a common\n good.[9]\n\nGreen\u2019s own conception of God is ambivalent. On the one hand, he\nidentifies the eternal self-consciousness of absolute idealism with\nGod. Green thinks that self-conscious minds are conditions of\nconscious experience and not themselves part of conscious experience,\nwith the result that they are outside of space and time. What is true\nof individual minds is true of the corporate mind that Green thinks\nmakes objectivity possible. This would make God a transcendent\nreality. On the other hand, Green has strong reason to regard God as\nimmanent in the world. Self-consciousness expresses itself in the\nwill, which is the cause of action. If so, self-consciousness cannot\nbe outside of space and time. Moreover, Green saw God as immanent in\nindividuals and in history. The higher principle of practical reason\nwithin each person that regulates his desires and makes him a moral\nagent is a divine principle, the common good is the proper object of\nthe divine principle in humanity, and its progressive realization in\nhuman laws and institutions is how God manifests himself to the world\n(Works III 223\u201327). One cannot separate Green\u2019s\nunorthodox form of Christianity from his idealist philosophy and his\nethical demand that individuals subordinate their lower selves to the\npursuit of a higher, common good.\n\nAs we have seen, Green treats perfection, freedom, and the common good\nas regulative ideals at which we aim, which humanity better\napproximates over time. This is illustrated in the gradual expansion\nof the scope of the common good to include persons previously excluded\nfrom full moral personality, such as slaves, women, and workers\n(PE Book III, esp. \u00a7\u00a7205\u2013206, 271, 285). It\nis also illustrated in our progressively more adequate conception of\nthe conditions of self-realization and the demands on government to\npromote the perfection of its citizens. Like Hegel, Green has a\nprogressive view of history, which he sees as the progressively more\nadequate realization of the demands of perfection, the common good,\nand true freedom (PE \u00a7\u00a7172\u201376;\n\u201cFreedom,\u201d Works II 330; LPPO\n\u00a76).\n6. Idealist Metaphysics and Ethics\n\nNow that we have surveyed Green\u2019s metaphysics and ethics,\nit\u2019s worth asking how they are related. One question is whether\nGreen\u2019s ethics is dependent on his metaphysics and, if so, in\nwhat ways. Another question is about the priority, if any, between\nindividual and collective levels of self-consciousness and value.\n\nIs Green\u2019s perfectionist ethical theory dependent on his\nidealist metaphysics? If so, his perfectionism is hostage to his\nidealism, and doubts about his metaphysics may threaten his\nperfectionism. The Prolegomena to Ethics is Green\u2019s\nmost systematic work, and its structure might suggest that his\nperfectionist ethics of self-realization developed in Books II-IV rest\non the idealist metaphysics defended in Book I. Certainly, many\ninterpreters have accepted this kind of interdependence of\nGreen\u2019s metaphysics and ethics (e.g., Nicholson 2006, Armour\n2006, and Mander 2006). However, several of Green\u2019s writings in\npractical philosophy\u2014notably, the essay \u201cLiberal\nLegislation\u201d and his Lectures on the Principles of Political\nObligation\u2014are not preceded by elaborate metaphysical\ndiscussions or arguments for absolute idealism. Moreover, even if we\nlook at the Prolegomena, much of the argument against\nhedonism and in favor of perfectionism and the common good are\nintelligible and assessable without recourse to doctrines of absolute\nidealism. It\u2019s true that self-consciousness plays a crucial role\nin both epistemic and practical agency. If idealism meant nothing more\nthan the importance of self-consciousness to knowledge and moral\npersonality, that might provide a kind of unity to Green\u2019s\nmetaphysics and ethics. It would represent the crucial idealist\nmetaphysical claim as a comparatively modest and plausible one. But\nthose claims about the importance of self-consciousness do not require\nany specifically idealist metaphysical claims that reality is limited\nto what is or can be an object of consciousness. Indeed, we have seen\nthat there is a tension between Green\u2019s moral psychology and his\nidealist metaphysics. Green thinks that responsibility consists in\ncapacities for self-conscious reflection and assessment of one\u2019s\ndesires and options and that self-realization or perfection consists\nin the proper exercise of these reasons-responsive capacities.\nGreen\u2019s perfectionist ethics require that self-conscious minds\nplay this causal role in the will and action, and that is inconsistent\nwith the assumption in Green\u2019s idealist metaphysics that\nself-conscious minds lie outside of space and time (Irwin 2009:\n\u00a71235).\n\nAnother question about Green\u2019s metaphysics and ethics is the\nrelation between individual and collective levels of analysis.\nConsider the priority of individual and corporate consciousness in\nGreen\u2019s metaphysics. It is clear that the individual is prior in\norder of discovery. We begin by trying to understand an\nindividual\u2019s conscious experience and knowledge. This leads\nGreen to embrace local idealism, understood as the claim that reality\nor knowable reality cannot concern things as they are in themselves,\nindependently of how they do or can appear to individual thinkers.\nIndeed, discussion of an individual\u2019s experience and knowledge\noccupies the bulk of Book I of the Prolegomena. Green then\ninvokes the supposition that there is a single corporate consciousness\nof which individual consciousnesses are proper parts to avoid an\nincommensurable plurality of individual-specific realities and to\nexplain the possibility of objectivity. On one reading, individual\nidealism remains primary, not just in the order of discovery but also\nin the order of explanation and justification. Green thinks inquiry\nsupports individual idealism, and absolute idealism is a kind of\nphilosophical speculation about how one might try to ground\nobjectivity for individual consciousness. On another reading, Green\nmight think that though individual idealism is prior in the order of\ndiscovery to absolute idealism, reflection about the possibility of\nobjectivity shows that absolute idealism is prior in order of\nexplanation or justification. On this view, corporate or eternal\nconsciousness is the only substance and individual consciousness are\naccidents of this substance.\n\nThere are also interesting issues about the individual and collective\nlevels of analysis in Green\u2019s ethics. On the one hand, there is\na tendency to read the British idealists as anti-individualists, which\nmight seem to apply to Green (e.g., Berlin 1958, Quinton 1971). After\nall, there is the reading of his ethics on which it depends not just\non his idealism but also on his absolute idealism. Moreover,\nGreen\u2019s claims about the importance of individuals seeking a\npermanent good that transcends their individual limitations and about\nthe regulation of each person\u2019s good by a noncompetitive common\ngood might seem to support this anti-individualist reading.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a number of reasons to resist this\nanti-individualist reading of Green. First, as we have seen, it may\nnot be necessary or desirable to see Green\u2019s perfectionist\nethics as resting on his idealist metaphysics, much less his absolute\nidealism. Second, Green\u2019s claims about the importance of a\npermanent good and the common good may be defensible from\nindividualist premises. Book II of the Prolegomena begins\nwith a focus on individual practical agency and the personal good,\nmuch as Book I begins with a focus on individual epistemic agency and\nknowledge. Green argues that individuals have reason to see their own\ninterests extended by participation in larger projects in community\nwith others, and this, he claims, gives them reason to seek a common\ngood.\n\nWe can identify two different ways of linking the personal good and\nthe common good. One way is from the outside-in, arguing that\nthe common good is explanatorily prior to the personal good and that\nthe good of individuals is just whatever is contributory to the good\nof some collective, whether that be God, humanity, or some more local\ncommunity. Another way is from the inside-out, arguing that\nthe personal good is more complete when it includes the right sort of\nassociation with others and includes the pursuit of a common good.\nFramed this way, there\u2019s a strong case to be made for the\ninside-out reading of Green\u2019s ethics. As we\u2019ve seen, the\nstructure of the argument in Books II\u2013III of the\nProlegomena has this inside-out character. This\ninterpretation is reinforced by claims Green makes in his\n\u201cFreedom\u201d essay. Recall that Green identifies true freedom\nwith determination by practical reason and perfect self-realization.\nHe distinguishes between Christian (Pauline) and Kantian conceptions\nof freedom, on the one hand, and a Hegelian conception, on the other\nhand (Works II 312\u201315). The principal difference seems\nto be in whom freedom is realized. Green thinks that the Christian and\nKantian see the individual as the locus of freedom, whereas Hegel\ntreats the state as the locus of freedom. In this debate, Green sides\nwith the Christian and Kantian.\n\n\nOn the other hand, it would seem that we cannot significantly speak of\nfreedom except with reference to individual persons; that only in them\ncan freedom be realised; that therefore the realisation of freedom in\nthe state can only mean the attainment of freedom by individuals\nthrough influences which the state (in the wide sense spoken of)\nsupplies\u2014\u201cfreedom\u201d here, as before, meaning not mere\nself-determination which renders us responsible, but determination by\nreasons, \u201cautonomy of the will\u201d\u2026. (Works\nII 314)\n\n\nHere, Green makes explicit that he understands the link between the\npersonal good, freedom, and the common good from the inside-out.\n\nThis fits with a common observation about the traditions and\nindividuals who influenced Green. Perhaps the strongest influences are\nthe Greeks, especially Aristotle, Kant, and Hegel. It is not uncommon\nfor readers to emphasize the Hegelian dimensions of Green. But despite\nGreen\u2019s sympathy with some Hegelian commitments\u2014idealism,\na progressive view of history, and the importance of freedom\u2014his\nversion of these commitments and the ways he defends them show fairly\nlittle direct influence by\n Hegel.[10]\n Moreover, many of the most important elements of Green\u2019s\nperfectionism\u2014especially the ethics of self-realization, its\ngrounding in rational agency, and its concern with the common\ngood\u2014are traceable to the influence of Aristotle and Kant. It is\nperhaps not unreasonable to follow Sidgwick who regards Green\nprincipally as a Kantian (Lectures 3; Irwin 2009: \u00a71234)\nor, even better, Green\u2019s student D.G. Ritchie who suggests that\nit is perhaps best to say that Green \u201c\u2026 corrected Kant by\nAristotle and Aristotle by Kant\u201d (1891: 139\u2013140).\n7. Concluding Remarks\n\nGreen was perhaps the most important figure within the tradition of\nBritish idealism. But the significance of his idealism extends beyond\nthat tradition. His defenses of idealist metaphysics and epistemology\nand absolute idealism make interesting contributions to an idealist\ntradition that includes Berkeley, Kant, Fichte, Hegel, and Bradley,\namong others. His idealist approach to ethics embraces a perfectionist\ntheory of self-realization committed to rich conceptions of freedom\nand the common good that aims to synthesize the best elements in Greek\neudaimonism and Kantian rationalism. Though perfectionism is an\nunderappreciated tradition, Green makes enduring contributions to that\ntradition. Green\u2019s perfectionism leads him to develop a\nprogressive conception of liberalism that was influential in British\npolitics in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and that\nbears comparison with contemporary conceptions of liberalism.\n",
