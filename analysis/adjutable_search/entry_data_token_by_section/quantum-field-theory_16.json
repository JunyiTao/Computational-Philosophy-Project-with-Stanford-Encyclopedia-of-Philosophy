    "main_text": "Further Philosophical Issues || Non-Localizability Theorems\n5.3 Non-Localizability Theorems\n\nThe observed \u2018particle traces\u2019, e.g., on photographic\nplates of bubble chambers, seem to be a clear indication for the\nexistence of particles. However, the theory which has been built on\nthe basis of these scattering experiments, QFT, turns out to have\nconsiderable problems to account for the observed \u2018particle\ntrajectories\u2019. Not only are sharp trajectories excluded by\nHeisenberg\u2019s uncertainty relations for position and momentum\ncoordinates, which hold for non-relativistic quantum mechanics\nalready. More advanced examinations in AQFT show that \u2018quantum\nparticles\u2019 which behave according to the principles of\nrelativity theory cannot be localized in any bounded region of\nspace-time, no matter how large, a result which excludes even\ntube-like trajectories. It thus appears to be impossible that our\nworld is composed of particles when we assume that localizability is a\nnecessary ingredient of the particle concept. So far there is no\nsingle unquestioned argument against the possibility of a particle\ninterpretation of QFT but the problems are piling up. Reeh &\nSchlieder, Hegerfeldt, Malament and Redhead all gained mathematical\nresults, or formalized their interpretation, which prove that certain\nsets of assumptions, which are taken to be essential for the particle\nconcept, lead to contradictions.\n\nThe Reeh-Schlieder theorem (1961) is a central result in\nAQFT. It asserts that acting on the vacuum state \\(\\Omega\\) with elements\nof the von Neumann observable algebra \\(R(O)\\) for open\nspace-time region \\(O\\), one can approximate as closely as one\nlikes any state in Hilbertspace\n\\(\\mathcal{H}\\), in particular one that is very\ndifferent from the vacuum in some space-like separated\nregion \\(O'\\). The Reeh-Schlieder theorem is thus\nexploiting long distance correlations of the vacuum. Or one can\nexpress the result by saying that local measurements do not allow for\na distinction between an N-particle state and the vacuum state.\nRedhead\u2019s (1995a) take on the Reeh-Schlieder theorem is that local\nmeasurements can never decide whether one observes an N-particle\nstate, since a projection operator \\(P_{\\Psi}\\) which\ncorresponds to an N-particle state \\(\\Psi\\) can never be an element of a\nlocal algebra\n\\(R(O)\\). Clifton & Halvorson (2001) discuss what\nthis means for the issue of entanglement. Halvorson (2001) shows that\nan alternative \u201cNewton-Wigner\u201d localization scheme fails\nto evade the problem of localization posed by the Reeh-Schlieder\ntheorem.\n\n\nMalament (1996) formulates a no-go theorem to the effect\nthat a relativistic quantum theory of a fixed number of particles\npredicts a zero probability for finding a particle in any spatial set,\nprovided four conditions are satisfied, namely concerning translation\ncovariance, energy, localizability and locality.\nThe localizability condition is the essential ingredient of\nthe particle concept: A particle\u2014in contrast to a\nfield\u2014cannot be found in two disjoint spatial sets at the same\ntime. The locality condition is the main relativistic part\nof Malament\u2019s assumptions. It requires that the statistics for\nmeasurements in one space-time region must not depend on whether or\nnot a measurement has been performed in a space-like related second\nspace-time region. Malament\u2019s proof has the weight of a no-go theorem\nprovided that we accept his four conditions as natural assumptions for\na particle interpretation. A relativistic quantum theory of a fixed\nnumber of particles, satisfying in particular the localizability and\nthe locality condition, has to assume a world devoid of particles (or\nat least a world in which particles can never be detected) in order\nnot to contradict itself. Malament\u2019s no-go theorem thus seems to show\nthat there is no middle ground between QM and QFT, i.e., no theory\nwhich deals with a fixed number of particles (like in QM) and which is\nrelativistic (like QFT) without running into the localizability\nproblem of the no-go theorem. One is forced towards QFT which, as\nMalament is convinced, can only be understood as a field\ntheory. Nevertheless, whether or not a particle interpretation of QFT\nis in fact ruled out by Malament\u2019s result is a point of debate. At\nleast prima facie Malament\u2019s no-go theorem alone cannot supply a final\nanswer since it assumes a fixed number of particles, an assumption\nthat is not valid in the case of QFT.\n\n\nThe results about non-localizability which have been explored above\nmay appear to be not very astonishing in the light of the following\nfacts about ordinary QM: Quantum mechanical wave functions (in\nposition representation) are usually smeared out over all\n \\(\\Re^3\\),\n so that everywhere in space there is a non-vanishing probability for\nfinding a particle. This is even the case arbitrarily close after a\nsharp position measurement due to the instantaneous spreading of wave\npackets over all space. Note, however, that ordinary QM is\nnon-relativistic. A conflict with SRT would thus not be very\nsurprising although it is not yet clear whether the above-mentioned\nquantum mechanical phenomena can actually be exploited to allow for\nsuperluminal signalling. QFT, on the other side, has been designed to\nbe in accordance with special relativity theory (SRT). The local\nbehavior of phenomena is one of the leading principles upon which the\ntheory was built. This makes non-localizability within the formalism\nof QFT a much severer problem for a particle interpretation.\n\n\nMalament\u2019s reasoning has come under attack in Fleming &\nButterfield (1999) and Busch (1999). Both argue to the effect that\nthere are alternatives to Malament\u2019s conclusion. The main line\nof thought in both criticisms is that Malament\u2019s \u2018mathematical\nresult\u2019 might just as well be interpreted as evidence that the\nassumed concept of a sharp localization operator is flawed and has to\nbe modified either by allowing for unsharp localization (Busch 1999)\nor for so-called \u201chyperplane dependent localization\u201d\n(Fleming & Butterfield 1999). In Saunders (1995) a different\nconclusion from Malament\u2019s (as well as from similar) results is\ndrawn. Rather than granting Malament\u2019s four conditions and deriving a\nproblem for a particle interpretation Saunders takes Malament\u2019s proof\nas further evidence that one can not hold on to all four\nconditions. According to Saunders it is the localizability condition\nwhich might not be a natural and necessary requirement on second\nthought. Stressing that \u201crelativity requires the language of\nevents, not of things\u201d Saunders argues that the localizability\ncondition loses its plausibility when it is applied to events: It\nmakes no sense to postulate that the same event can not occur at two\ndisjoint spatial sets at the same time. One can only require for the\nsame kind of event not to occur at both places. For Saunders\nthe particle interpretation as such is not at stake in Malament\u2019s\nargument. The question is rather whether QFT speaks about things at\nall. Saunders considers Malament\u2019s result to give a negative answer to\nthis question. A kind of meta paper on Malament\u2019s theorem is\nHalvorson & Clifton (2002). Various objections to the choice of\nMalament\u2019s assumptions and his conclusion are considered and\nrebutted. Moreover, Halvorson and Clifton establish two further no-go\ntheorems which preserve Malament\u2019s theorem by weakening tacit\nassumptions and showing that the general conclusion still holds. One\nthing seems to be clear. Since Malament\u2019s \u2018mathematical\nresult\u2019 appears to allow for various different conclusions it\ncannot be taken as conclusive evidence against the tenability of a\nparticle interpretation of QFT and the same applies to Redhead\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem. For a more detailed\nexposition and comparison of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem and Malament\u2019s\ntheorem see Kuhlmann (2010a: sec. 8.3).\n\nDoes the field interpretation also suffer from problems\nconcerning non-localizability? In the section \u201cDeficiencies of\nthe Conventional Formulation of QFT\u201d we already saw that,\nstrictly speaking, field operators cannot be defined at points but\nneed to be smeared out in the (finite and arbitrarily small) vicinity\nof points, giving rise to smeared field\noperators \\(\\hat{\\phi}(f)\\),\nwhich represent the weighted average field value in the respective\nregion. This procedure leads to operator-valued distributions instead\nof operator-valued fields. The lack of field operators at points\nappears to be analogous to the lack of position operators in QFT,\nwhich troubles the particle interpretation. However, for position\noperators there is no remedy analogous to that for field operators:\nwhile even unsharply localized particle positions do not exist in QFT\n(see Halvorson and Clifton 2002, theorem 2), the existence of smeared\nfield operators demonstrates that there are at least point-like field\noperators. On this basis Lupher (2010) proposes a \u201cmodified\nfield ontology\u201d.\n",
