    "main_text": "Issues about Diachronic Norms || Self-Locating Credences\n5.5 Self-Locating Credences\n\nOne\u2019s self-locating credences are, for example,\ncredences about who one is, where one is, and what time it is. Such\ncredences pose some challenges to conditionalization. Let me mention\ntwo below.\n\nTo begin with, consider the following case, adapted from Titelbaum\n(2013a: ch. 12):\n\n\nExample (Writer). At \\(t_1\\) it\u2019s midday\non Wednesday, and a writer is sitting in an office finishing a\nmanuscript for a publisher, with a deadline by the end of next day,\nbeing certain that she only has three more sections to go. Then, at\n\\(t_2\\), she notices that it gets dark out\u2014in fact, she has lost\nsense of time because of working too hard, and she is now only sure\nthat it is either Wednesday evening or early Thursday morning. She\nalso notices that she has only got one section done since the midday.\nSo the writer utters to herself: \u201cNow, I still have two more\nsections to go\u201d. That is the new evidence for her to change\ncredences.\n\n\n\nThe problem is that it is not immediately clear what exactly is the\nproposition E that the writer should conditionalize on. The\nright E appears to be the proposition expressed by the\nwriter\u2019s utterance: \u201cNow, I still have two more sections\nto go\u201d. And the expressed proposition must be one of the\nfollowing two candidates, depending on when the utterance is actually\nmade (assuming the standard account of indexicals, due to Kaplan\n1989):\n\n\\((A)\\)\n The writer still has two more sections to go on Wednesday\nevening.\n\n\n\\((B)\\) \n The writer still has two more sections to go on early Thursday\nMorning.\n\n\nBut, with the lost sense of time, it also seems that the writer should\nconditionalize on a less informative body of evidence: the disjunction\n\\(A \\vee B\\). So exactly what should she conditionalize on? \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\), or \\(A \\vee B\\)? See Titelbaum (2016) for a survey of some\nproposed solutions to this problem.\n\nWhile the previous problem concerns only the inputs that should be\npassed to the conditionalization process, conditionalization itself is\nchallenged when self-locating credences meet the danger of memory\nloss. Consider the following case, made popular in epistemology by\nElga (2000):\n\n\nExample (Sleeping Beauty). Sleeping Beauty\nparticipates in an experiment. She knows for sure that she will be\ngiven a sleeping pill that induces limited amnesia. She knows for sure\nthat, after she falls asleep, a fair coin will be flipped. If it lands\nheads, she will be awakened on Monday and asked: \u201cHow confident\nare you that the coin landed heads?\u201d. She will not be informed\nwhich day it is. If the coin lands tails, she will be awaken on both\nMonday and on Tuesday and asked the same question each time. The\namnesia effect is designed to ensure that, if awakened on Tuesday she\nwill not remember being woken on Monday. And Sleeping Beauty knows all\nthat for sure.\n\n\n\nWhat should her answer be when she is awakened on Monday and asked how\nconfident she is in the coin\u2019s landing heads? Lewis (2001)\nemploys the Principle of Conditionalization to argue that the answer\nis \\(1/2\\). His reasoning proceeds as follows: Sleeping Beauty, upon\nher awakening, acquires no new evidence or acquires only a piece of\nnew evidence that she is already certain of, so by conditionalization\nher credence in the coin\u2019s landing heads ought to remain the\nsame as it was before the sleep: \\(1/2\\).\n\nBut Elga (2000) argues that the answer is \\(1/3\\) rather than \\(1/2\\).\nIf so, that will seem to be a counterexample to the Principle of\nConditionalization. Here is a sketch of his argument. Imagine that we\nare Sleeping Beauty and reason as follows. We just woke up, and there\nare only three possibilities on the table, regarding how the coin\nlanded and what day it is today:\n\n\\((A)\\)\n Heads and it\u2019s Monday.\n\n\n\\((B)\\) \n Tails and it\u2019s Monday.\n\n\n\\((C)\\) \nTails and it\u2019s Tuesday.\n\n\nIf we are told that it\u2019s Monday (\\(A \\vee B\\)), we will judge\nthat the coin\u2019s landing heads (\\(A\\)) is as probable as its\nlanding tails (\\(B\\)). So \n\\[\\Cr(A \\mid A \\vee B) = \\Cr(B \\mid A \\vee B) = 1/2.\\]\n\n\nIf we are told that it lands tails (\\(B \\vee C\\)), we will judge that\ntoday being Monday (\\(B\\)) and today being Tuesday (\\(C\\)) are equally\nprobable. So  \n\\[\\Cr(B \\mid B \\vee C) = \\Cr(C \\mid B \\vee C) = 1/2.\\]\n\n\nThe only way to meet the above conditions is to distribute the\nunconditional credences evenly:  \n\\[\\Cr(A) = \\Cr(B) = \\Cr(C) = 1/3.\\]\n\n\nHence the credence in landing heads, \\(A\\), is equal to \\(1/3\\), or so\nElga concludes. This result seems to challenge the Principle of\nConditionalization, which recommends the answer \\(1/2\\) as explained\nabove.
