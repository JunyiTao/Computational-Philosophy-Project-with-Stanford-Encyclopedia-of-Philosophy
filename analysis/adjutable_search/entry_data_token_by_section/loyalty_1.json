    "main_text": "Introduction || Roots\n1.2 Roots\n\nAlthough the term \u201cloyalty\u201d has its immediate philological\norigins in Old French, its older and mostly abandoned linguistic roots\nare in the Latin lex (law). Nevertheless, dimensions of the\nphenomenon that we now recognize as loyalty are as ancient as human\nassociation, albeit often manifested in its breaches (disloyalty,\nbetrayal). The Old Testament writers were often occupied with the\nfickleness of human commitments, whether to God or to each other. To\ncharacterize such fickleness they tended to use the language of\n(un)faithfulness, though nowadays we might be inclined to use the more\nrestricted language of (in)fidelity, which has regard to specific\ncommitments. In medieval to early modern uses of the term, loyalty\ncame to be affirmed primarily in the oath or pledge of fealty or\nallegiance sworn by a vassal to his lord. That had an interesting\noffshoot as monarchical feudalism lost sway: loyal subjects who were\ndistressed by the venality of sitting sovereigns found it\nnecessary\u2014as part of their effort to avoid charges of\ntreason\u2014to distinguish their ongoing loyalty to the institution\nof kingship from their loyalty to a particular king.\n",
