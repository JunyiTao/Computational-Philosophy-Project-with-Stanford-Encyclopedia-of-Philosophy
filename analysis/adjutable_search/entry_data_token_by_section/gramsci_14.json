    "main_text": "Prison Writings || The Philosophy of Praxis\n3.5 The Philosophy of Praxis\n\nThe Notebooks present an extensive critique of what Gramsci\nsaw as the prevailing orthodoxy in Marxist philosophy. Exemplary here\nwas the analysis by the Russian philosopher and economist, Nikolai\nBukharin, in his Theory of Historical Materialism: A Popular\nManual of Marxist Sociology (published in 1921), a text Gramsci\nhad utilized in party schools. Gramsci now rejected Bukharin\u2019s\ntreatment of Marxism as a deterministic science of society and used\nhis text as a foil to present an alternative account of historical\nmaterialism that he labelled the \u201cphilosophy of praxis\u201d,\nfollowing the late nineteenth century Hegelian Marxist philosopher,\nAntonio Labriola. Gramsci probably used Labriola\u2019s term to evade\nthe prison censor but, undoubtedly, it captured the primacy he gave to\npractical, political questions in his approach to theorizing. He saw\nMarxism as a philosophy aimed at critically engaging popular common\nsense, laying the basis for a new hegemony.\n\nThe Popular Manual, as Gramsci referred to it, demonstrated\nthe worst of what he called \u201cvulgar materialism\u201d (SPN:\n407). It reduced Marxism to a search for the causal laws of social\nevolution and accepted, without reflection, the positive sciences as\nthe sole model of knowledge. It took up a speculative\n\u201cmethod\u201d positioned outside of history to observe\nsupposedly \u201cobjective\u201d mechanical regularities and to make\npredictions about their development (see SPN: 425\u201340). This view\nwas mistaken for various reasons: instead of treating Marxism as an\noriginal philosophy, it subordinated it to the natural sciences; it\nfailed to grasp the \u201cdialectic\u201d in Marxism, which\nunderscored the critical struggle against established thought (SPN:\n434\u201335); and it separated thought from action, \u201cscience\nand life\u201d, and therefore divided intellectuals with knowledge\nfrom the experiences of \u201cthe great popular masses\u201d (SPN:\n442).\n\nTo remedy these defects, Gramsci argued that Marxism, or historical\nmaterialism, be understood as a philosophy rooted in history, as an\nexpression of the practical struggle to rethink those circumstances\nanew. As such it \u201ccontains in itself all the fundamental\nelements to construct a total and integral conception of the\nworld\u201d (SPN: 462). Thought and action should be understood as\ndialectically intertwined in a developmental process that can\n\u201cbring into being a new form of State [\u2026] a new\nintellectual and moral order [\u2026] a new type of society\u201d\n(SPN: 388). Historical materialism was not an abstract framework from\nwhich merely to observe historical change; it was the philosophical\nvehicle whose expansion into a cultural outlook aimed to bring about\nthat change (see FSPN: 395\u201396). Gramsci affirmed\nLabriola\u2019s designation of Marxism as a \u201cphilosophy of\npraxis\u201d because it insisted on the unity of thought and action\n(praxis)\u2014and, through that, the gradual formation of an\nautonomous moral and cultural worldview\u2014as the guiding principle\nof Marx\u2019s philosophy (SPN: 388).\n\nGramsci also proposed that Croce\u2019s idealism could be of\n\u201cinstrumental value\u201d to a renewed philosophy of praxis.\nInfluenced by Marxism, Crocean historicism conceived thought and\nexpression as entirely \u201cimmanent\u201d to history, that is, as\nresponses to concrete problems, undetermined by any transcendent\nscheme or teleology. Croce presented \u201cliberty\u201d as the\nunifying ethical principle expressing this historicist sensibility;\nthe basis to what he conceived as a modern religion. Gramsci\nacknowledged that Croce had\n\n\nforcefully drawn attention to the importance of cultural and\nintellectual factors in the development of history [\u2026] to the\nmoment of hegemony and consent. (FSPN: 357)\n\n\nYet, he claimed, Croce also erased class conflict in his historical\nwriting, emphasizing only periods of liberal hegemony\u2014the\nconsensual, ethical aspects of history and not the violence or\npolitical struggles that ushered in bourgeois society, such as the\nFrench Revolution (SPN: 119; see also GPL: 213\u201314,\n215\u201316). By contrast, a philosophy of praxis would build on\nCroce\u2019s insights, focusing instead on\n\u201cethico-political\u201d history\u2014the socio-economic\ndivisions that bring, dialectically, a new culture into\nexistence\u2014without his partial, liberal gloss. It would\nvigorously critique received common sense beliefs, philosophies, and\nhierarchies that prevented the advance of ordinary people (SPN:\n330\u201331). Gramsci described the philosophy of praxis as an\n\u201cabsolute \u2018historicism\u2019, the absolute secularisation\nand earthliness of thought\u201d (SPN: 465).\n\nIn rejecting the scientific model of knowledge in favor of a form of\nhistorical consciousness, Gramsci radically shifted Marxism\u2019s\nepistemological bearings. The measure of historical materialism lay\nnot exclusively in the immediate empirical \u201ctruth\u201d of its\npropositions or predictions but, moreover, in the cultural and\npolitical efficacy of its overall intellectual and moral reform, which\nenabled creative subjective engagement with objective conditions:\n\u201cit is a philosophy which is also politics\u201d (SPN: 395). He\nsuggested that mass \u201cadhesion or non-adhesion to an ideology is\nthe real critical test of the rationality and historicity of modes of\nthinking\u201d, not just direct correspondence of theory to an\nindependent reality (SPN: 341); and that \u201cprediction\u201d was\nnot so much \u201ca scientific act of knowledge\u201d as \u201cthe\nabstract expression of the effort made, the practical way of creating\na collective will\u201d (SPN: 438). Gramsci compared the philosophy\nof praxis to the Protestant Reformation in so far as its success\nresided in generating cultural agreement to cement civil and political\nunity (SPN: 395).\n\nGramsci was not suggesting that truth was only a matter of\nshared agreement. The philosophy of praxis still aligned to the\nfoundational Marxist principle that social consciousness\n\u201ccorresponds\u201d to material relations of production,\nknowledge of which was necessary for any practical effort. Marxism\ntherefore required \u201cthe critique of ideologies\u201d which\n\u201ctend to hide reality\u201d (FSPN: 396) and, in this, it sought\nto bring thought and action into rational correspondence. But the\nphilosophy of praxis could achieve that only if it were grasped as a\nform of politics, not an abstract science.\n\nThese comments are consistent with Gramsci\u2019s general line of\nargument in the Notebooks on the strategic importance of\nbuilding consent prior to revolution. They indicate that such a\nstrategy was not a momentary, tactical initiative. It aligned with his\naspiration for a cultural transformation over the longer term. His\nfocus on the subjective, \u201csuperstructural\u201d element of\nclass politics certainly put Gramsci at odds with more objectivist\naccounts of Marxism, but it was far from an aversion to the reality of\n\u201cstructural\u201d and empirical constraints (see Morera 1990).\nWhatever its shortcomings as a generalizable Marxist theory,\nGramsci\u2019s philosophy of praxis was in keeping with his attempt\nto conceive revolutionary politics as the preparation of a\n\u201ctotal, integral civilisation\u201d (SPN: 462; see Thomas\n2009).\n",
