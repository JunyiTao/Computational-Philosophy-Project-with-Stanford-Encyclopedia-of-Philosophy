    "main_text": "Basic Sign Structure\n1. Basic Sign Structure\n\nIn one of his many definitions of a sign, Peirce writes:\n\nI define a sign as anything which is so determined by something else,\ncalled its Object, and so determines an effect upon a person, which\neffect I call its interpretant, that the later is thereby mediately\ndetermined by the former. (EP2, 478)\n\n\nWhat we see here is Peirce\u2019s basic claim that signs consist of three\ninter-related parts: a sign, an object, and an interpretant. For the\nsake of simplicity, we can think of the sign as the signifier, for\nexample, a written word, an utterance, smoke as a sign for fire etc.\nThe object, on the other hand, is best thought of as whatever is\nsignified, for example, the object to which the written or uttered\nword attaches, or the fire signified by the smoke. The interpretant,\nthe most innovative and distinctive feature of Peirce\u2019s account, is\nbest thought of as the understanding that we have of the sign/object\nrelation. The importance of the interpretant for Peirce is that\nsignification is not a simple dyadic relationship between sign and\nobject: a sign signifies only in being interpreted. This makes the\ninterpretant central to the content of the sign, in that, the meaning\nof a sign is manifest in the interpretation that it generates in sign\nusers. Things are, however, slightly more complex than this and we\nshall look at these three elements in more detail.\n",
