    "main_text": "Processes of Reconciliation || Forgiveness\n3.8 Forgiveness\n\nThere is considerable disagreement, especially in the political\nliterature, on the relationship between forgiveness and\nreconciliation. Can parties be reconciled if forgiveness is refused?\nIs forgiveness genuine if the victim refuses to restore her\nrelationship with the wrongdoer? In part, differences of opinion on\nthese matters are traceable to the sorts of disagreements about\ndefining reconciliation that have been surveyed here (namely,\nregarding the kinds and degrees of improvement that must be made\nbefore a specific kind of relationship may be described as\nreconciled). Similar disagreements over the nature of forgiveness\ncomplicate matters even further.\n\nIn the literature on interpersonal forgiveness, definitions of\nforgiveness commonly focus on the overcoming or forswearing of\nresentment (or similar negative attitudes) that were the result of\nwrongdoing, and (some would add) the reestablishment of positive\nattitudes, such as goodwill, toward the wrongdoer (J. Murphy 2003,\nPettigrove 2012). Where such changes in attitude do not occur, but\nwhere the parties to the wrong manage to reestablish peaceful\ncoexistence, cooperation or even trust, talk of reconciliation seems\nreasonable. This would be a case of reconciliation without\nforgiveness. Similarly, a victim might let go of her resentment of\nsomeone who mistreated her and yet take steps to avoid future contact\nwith that person out of concern for her safety. Such a case exhibits\nforgiveness without reconciliation. Forgiveness and reconciliation, on\nthis account, appear to be distinct and independent phenomena.\n\nStill, the attitude-centered account of forgiveness is compatible with\nthe view that forgiving is a powerful means to reconciliation. The\nsorts of negative attitudes that are overcome by forgiveness are\npowerful obstacles to good relations. When those attitudes are\nresolved, reconciliation is an unsurprising result. It also makes\nsense, given this view of forgiveness, to argue that a case of\nreconciliation that does not include forgiveness is less complete than\none that does include forgiveness. Depending on the circumstances, an\nimprovement in relations that leaves resentment and ill will in place\nmay not seem worthy of the label \u2018reconciliation.\u2019 In\nthese cases, one might say that forgiveness is necessary for\nreconciliation.\n\nWhen commentators work with a different conception of forgiveness, the\ndiscussion of reconciliation is also different. One alternative view of\nforgiveness, which appears to be more popular in political than\ninterpersonal contexts, places emphasis on the actions of victims\nrather than their internal mental states, suggesting that when a\nperson or group forgives they gives up their moral right to hold the\nwrong against the wrongdoer (Digeser 2001, Wolterstorff 2013). Such\nviews have been labeled \u2018relational\u2019 or\n\u2018commissive\u2019 accounts of forgiveness (Blustein 2014,\nPettigrove 2012). Exactly how much one gives up in forgiving is not\nalways specified and opinions seem to differ. At a minimum, the victim\nforswears his right to personally retaliate against the wrongdoer. But\ndoes forgiving entail that he also forswears calling for punishment by\nthe proper authorities, or reparations for the harms he suffered, or\nhis right to remind the wrongdoer and others of the wrong? If one\nthinks of forgiveness as relinquishing a (more or less broad) right to\nhold a wrong against a wrongdoer, then it seems forgiveness may well\nbe productive of reconciliation. However, depending on how much\nvictims give up in forgiving, this kind of reconciliation may be\npurchased at the cost of justice (Blustein 2014). In contrast, those\nwho think of forgiving as the overcoming of resentment often argue\nthat victims can forgive yet also call for punishment, reparations and\nremembrance of the wrong (J. Murphy 2003).\n\nHowever one defines forgiveness, the claim that victims should forgive\nin order to bring about valuable reconciliation is likely to be\ncontroversial because it asks the very people who were most deeply\ninsulted, wronged and harmed by the past conflict to bear the burden\nof repairing it. Another point of concern is whether the victims are\nbeing asked to forgive unconditionally (that is, without any prior,\nameliorative response from the wrongdoer) or conditionally (that is,\nin response to a morally significant change in or act by the\nwrongdoer) (Garrard and McNaughton 2011). Furthermore, whether or not\na particular act of forgiveness would be morally appropriate,\nvirtuous, or even prudent for the victim, pressuring a victim to\nforgive is widely regarded as problematic (Govier and Verwoerd\n2002b).\n\nEfforts to make forgiveness central to reconciliation also run into\nquestions about who has the standing to forgive. To forgive on behalf\nof a living victim is morally unacceptable, if not simply impossible\n(Govier and Verwoerd 2002b). Some theorists also hold that it is\nimpossible to forgive on behalf of deceased victims, from which it\nfollows that wrongs such as murder will be unforgivable\n(Jank\u00e9l\u00e9vitch 2005). In these cases, the possibility of\na reconciliation that is distinct from forgiveness offers a way to\nconceive of a positive resolution of the past. Theorists debate\nwhether states or other groups might have the standing to forgive on\ntheir own behalf, independent of the choices of individual victims.\nThose who think of forgiveness as primarily a change in attitudes must\nmake sense of attributing such mental states to groups, perhaps by\nexplaining how attitude changes in representative persons (such as\nleaders or spokespeople) qualify as group forgiveness (cf. Griswold\n2007). The claim that groups can forgive is easier to make for those\nwho think of forgiveness as the waiving of a set of rights\n(Wolterstorff 2013).\n",
