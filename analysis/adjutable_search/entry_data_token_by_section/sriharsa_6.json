    "main_text": "Epistemology || Knowledge as Discrimination\n2.3 Knowledge as Discrimination\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a considers another proposal\u2014defended by\nUdayana and Bh\u0101sarvaj\u00f1a (10th century\nCE)\u2014according to which knowledge is \u201cproper\ncircumscription\u201d (samyak-paricchitti)\n(Up\u0101dhy\u0101ya & \u015a\u0101stri 1957: 475;\nSv\u0101m\u012b Yog\u012bndr\u0101nanda 1968: 11). In explaining this definition, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\nsays that \u201cproper circumscription\u201d can\u2019t just mean\ntrue or correct awareness; for then this proposal\nwill inherit all the problems that the \u201ctrue awareness\u201d\naccount of knowledge faces. So, he reconstructs this proposal on the\nbasis of some remarks that Udayana makes elsewhere while discussing\nknowledge of one\u2019s\n knowledge.[16]\n\n\nAccording to the reconstructed proposal, knowledge is proper\ncircumscription of an object in the sense that it involves an\nawareness of an object along with (or on the basis\nof) its distinctive mark\n(vi\u015be\u1e63asahita-dharmi-paricchitti). The best\nversion of this proposal\u2014which \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a arrives\nat after considering a series of initial refinements\u2014seems to be\nthis.\n\n\nknowledge iv Knowledge is proper\ncircumscription of an object, i.e., an agent knows that an object\no is F if and only if she is aware of o as having a\nproperty X which it in fact has, such that X\ndistinguishes o from all\n non-Fs.[17]\n\n\n\nOn this picture, knowledge involves discrimination: in order\nto know that an object o is F, one must be able to\ndiscriminate o from things that are not F. Knowledge\ngives the agent this ability insofar as it involves an\nawareness-episode that puts the agent in touch with a genuine feature\nof the object o in virtue of which she can distinguish o\nfrom non-Fs. We can see how this definition rules out cases\nlike Shells, Mist, and Horns. In\nShells, since the agent\u2019s awareness-episode arises from\na blind guess, he or she isn\u2019t aware of any distinctive mark\nX in virtue of which she could tell whether the number of\nshells in the gambler\u2019s hand is five rather than, say, three or\nfour. Similarly, in Mist, the agent mistakes mist for smoke.\nEven though smoke is a distinctive mark of fire, the smoke that she\nascribes to the mountain isn\u2019t a property that the mountain\nactually has. Finally, in Horns, the agent infers that the\nanimal before her is a cow on the basis of the fact that it has horns.\nBut horns aren\u2019t a distinctive mark of cows.\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a argues that this definition of knowledge\nfails to satisfy the criterion of uniformity; for the relevant\ndistinctive mark\u2014the awareness of which is necessary for\nknowledge\u2014will vary from one case to another. For example, when\nit comes to an awareness of a clod of earth as earth, the distinctive\nproperty X would have to be a property distinctive of earth,\ne.g., earthhood or having smell, etc. But when it\ncomes to recognizing a cow as a cow, the distinctive property X\nwould have to be something else: a property that is distinctive of\ncows, e.g., cowhood or having a dewlap,\netc. In general, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a claims that there\nis no way of uniformly characterizing this distinctive property\nX that an agent needs to be aware of in order to have\n knowledge.[18]\n\nMore importantly, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a suggests that even if there\nare uniform characterizations of the notion of a distinctive\nmark, such characterizations will inevitably be uninformative. To\nshow this, he considers a minimal pair of cases which we may flesh out\nas follows.\n\n\nCastor and Pollux. Uma and Una are talking to two\ndistinct speakers: Una is talking to a reliable speaker Castor, while\nUma is talking to an unreliable speaker Pollux. Both Castor and Pollux\ncorrectly inform them that there are five fruits hanging from the tree\non the river-bank. However, on the basis of the relevant bits of\ntestimony, only Una knows that there are five fruits hanging from the\ntree on river-bank, but Uma doesn\u2019t (KKh 230).\n\n\n\nThe challenge is this. Both Uma and Una get the same information from\nthe relevant speakers. But in order to explain the difference in\nepistemic status between their awareness-episodes, the defender of\nknowledge iv needs to show that Una is aware\nof a distinctive mark X in virtue of which she can tell that\nthere are five fruits hanging from the tree on the river-bank, but Uma\nisn\u2019t aware of any such distinctive mark. But we could just\nstipulate that in Castor and Pollux, there is no property\nX such that Una is aware of X on the basis of\nCastor\u2019s testimony, but Uma is not aware of X on the\nbasis of Pollux\u2019s testimony. This shows that we cannot clearly\nidentify the distinctive mark X in every case of knowledge.\n\nFor \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a, without any adequate uniform\nand informative characterization of the distinctive mark\nX, the definition of knowledge as proper circumscription of the\nobject ought to be rejected (for other objections that he offers, see\nGaneri 2016). This charge seems to be getting at something general\nabout a class of different approaches towards defining knowledge.\nSeveral contemporary theories of knowledge involve a conception of\nknowledge as involving a discriminatory capacity of some kind. Take,\nfor instance, the relevant alternatives theory which says\nthat in order to know a proposition P, an agent must be able to\nrule out relevant possibilities where P is false (Stine 1976;\nGoldman 1976; Dretske 1981; Lewis 1996). However, as it turns out,\nwhich possibilities count as relevant will vary from one scenario to\nanother, and perhaps also from one context of knowledge-attribution to\nanother. In particular cases, we might indeed be able to tell whether\na certain alternative counts as relevant or not. But it is unclear\nthat we could systematize these intuitions enough to produce a single\nunified criterion of relevance; or, even if we did manage to do so, it\nis unclear whether such a criterion would be informative enough to\ngenerate predictions about every possible scenario. Thus, once again,\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s worry generalizes.\n",
