History of U.S. Reparations to Blacks\n\n\nOddly, Thomas Jefferson was probably the first to imply that the\nU.S. ought to make reparation to its slaves. He did not explicitly\nsay that it did or ought to, and his proposal to send them off\nto \u201csuch place as circumstances of the time should render most\nproper\u201d and to \u201cdeclare them a free and independent\npeople\u201d was mainly motivated by a desire to rid the U.S. of them,\nbut it also suggests that they were a people and that the U.S. was\nunder some obligation to set them up as a people (Jefferson 1785a\n[1954: 138]). Some years after Jefferson\u2019s proposal, American\nslaveholders founded (1816) the American Colonization Society whose\nostensible object, made plausible by the presence of some white Quakers\namong its founders, was to help African Americans to go to Liberia and\nget a fresh start in a country free of racial discrimination. But the\nreal object of the Society, or at least that of the white slaveholders\nwho founded it, was to rid the country of free blacks who they feared\nendangered their peculiar institution. Their stratagem was therefore\ndealt a deadly blow when Martin Delany, who agreed with Jefferson that\nU.S. blacks were a people and needed a territory on which to become a\nstate, declared that Liberia was \u201cnot an independent\nnation at all; but a poor miserable mockery\u2014a\nburlesque on a government\u2014a pitiful dependency on the\nAmerican Colonizationists\u201d and its \u201cprincipal man, called\nPresident, in Liberia\u201d was a \u201cmere parrot\u201d of these\nindividuals (Delany 1852 [2004]: 185, emphasis in original).\n\nDemands for compensation related to slavery frequently arose during\nthe U.S. Civil War, but not do so in the way present day U.S. citizens\nwould expect. The demands were not to compensate the black slaves for\nthe injuries of slavery, but to compensate the white slaveholders for\nthe anticipated loss of their slaves. These demands were voiced in the\nSouth when they faced the prospect of having to free their slaves, but\nthey were also voiced in the North, and from the highest sources.\nPresident Abraham Lincoln, for example, repeatedly urged compensated\nemancipation, which meant paying the slaveholders for the loss of their\nslaves who would then be deported from the U.S.. Indeed, at one time he\nappeared to be ready to propose paying the South $400,000,000, for the\nloss of their slaves. As W.E.B. Du Bois observed dryly: \u201cLincoln\nwas impressed by the loss of capital invested in slaves, but curiously\nnever seemed seriously to consider the correlative loss of wage and\nopportunity of slave workers, the tangible results of whose\nexploitation had gone into the planters\u2019 pockets for two\ncenturies.\u201d (Du Bois 1992 [1935]: 150). And Lincoln did not even\nsugar coat his deportation proposal with the suggestion that the\nfreedmen were a nation and therefore needed a separate territory on\nwhich to govern themselves.\n\nThaddeus Stevens, congressman from Pennsylvania, argued that it was\nnot enough to free the slaves and give them the right of suffrage; but\nthat in addition they should be given land confiscated from the rebels.\nCharles Summer, senator from Massachusetts eventually came to agree\nwith him, but surprisingly the radical ex-slave Frederick Douglass did\nnot. Peter C. Myers (2008) speculated that Douglass\u2019s\n\u201cmoderation\u201d at this point was a reflection of \u201cwhat\nwas politically possible,\u201d and of his concern that benevolent\nmissions organized by whites might encourage dependence in the freedmen\nand prevent them from developing and exercising the virtues of a free\npeople. Douglass\u2019 proposed instead a federal corporation that\nwould purchase tracts of land and then resell or lease them on\nfavorable terms to the freedmen, urging that this arrangement was\n\u201cmore fully consistent with the principle of self-reliance\u201d\nand give \u201cgreater societal recognition of the freed\npeople\u2019s virtue in providing for themselves.\u201d Myers\nsuggested that Douglass was following Jefferson in emphasizing the\ncorrupting effects of dependence. But while Jefferson had indeed\nidentified dependence as a crucial corrupter, it \u201cbegets\nsubservience and venality, suffocates virtue, and prepares fit tools\nfor the designs of ambition\u201d (Jefferson 1785a [1954: 165]) he\ndeclared, he was equally clear that legislators must protect the\nindependence of the small yeoman farmer \u201cthe most precious part\nof the state\u201d from the usurpation of the powerful (Jefferson 1785b\n[2006: 154]). In other words, Stevens had proposed his scheme for the\nfreed people for exactly the reasons Jefferson proposed legislation for\nprotecting the white yeomen. Years later Douglass evidently saw the\nerror of his moderation. Myers cites his comment in 1882 that had the\ncounsels of Thaddeus Stevens, Charles Sumner, and \u2018leading\nstalwart Republicans\u2019 prevailed, \u201cthe terrible evils from\nwhich we now suffer would have been averted\u201d, and \u201cthe\nNegro to-day\u201d, would be \u201ctilling his soil in comparative\nindependence\u201d (Myers 2008: 239, quoting Douglass 1882, Appendix\nA, 440\u2013441). The theme continues to the present day.\n\nPerhaps the most noteworthy demand for U.S. black reparations after\nthe Civil War occurred in 1969 when James Foreman, a member of the\nStudent Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), read his \u201cBlack\nManifesto\u201d at the National Black Economic Development Conference,\nin Detroit, and later on in Riverside Church in New York City. The\n\u201cManifesto\u201d demanded $500,000,000, in reparations from\nChristian white churches and Jewish synagogues, or as the\n\u201cManifesto\u201d put it, \u201c15 dollars per nigger.\u201d\nThis demand for reparations, the Manifesto argued, was justified\nbecause for over three and a half centuries, whites with the assistance\nand collaboration of their churches and synagogues had unjustly,\nthrough slavery and discrimination, wrested enormous economic\nadvantages from blacks. Although this argument relied on widely\naccepted moral intuitions, the Manifesto received little popular\nsupport. It did, however, provoke discussion in newspapers and news\nmagazines, as well as some scholarly discussion. Boris Bittker included\nit as an appendix in his book The Case for Black Reparations\n(1973); Hugo Bedau provided and extended analysis in his\n\u201cCompensatory Justice and the Black Manifesto\u201d (1972);\nMichael Harrington and Arnold Kaufman debated its merits in\n\u201cBlack Reparations\u2014Two Views\u201d (1969); and a number of\nphilosophers wrote essays inspired by its argument, most notably,\nBernard R. Boxill (1972).\n\nAlthough interest in the topic remained high among U.S. black\nphilosophers, the wider community of political philosophers preoccupied\nwith Rawlsian ideal theory generally ignored it. But broad and vigorous\ninterest has been rekindled. Perhaps the causes lie outside of\nacademia; in 1988, the U.S. Congress passed the Civil Liberties Act\nwhich authorized payment of reparations to Japanese American citizens\nwho had been imprisoned during World War II; U.S. Congressman John\nConyers had in each session of Congress since 1989 introduced a bill to\ncreate a commission to study reparations for slavery and segregation;\nin 2000 Randall Robinson published his book The Debt: What America\nOwes to Blacks; in 2003 David Horowitz published his Uncivil\nWars; and in 2014 Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s widely discussed essay\n\u201cThe Case for Reparations\u201d, appeared in The\nAtlantic. In September 2020, \nCalifornia Assembly Bill 3121 established the \n Task Force to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans, \n  in connection with the enslavement of blacks in the U.S.\n",
