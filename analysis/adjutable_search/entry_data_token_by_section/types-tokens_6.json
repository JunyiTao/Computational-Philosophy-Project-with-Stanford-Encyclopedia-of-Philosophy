    "main_text": "What is a Type?\n4. What is a Type?\n\n\nThe question permits answers at varying levels of generality. At its\nmost general, it is a request for a theory of types, the way set\ntheory answers the question \u201cwhat is a set?\u201d A general\nanswer would tell us what sort of thing a type\u2014any\ntype\u2014is. For example, is it sui generis, or a\nuniversal, or perhaps the set of its tokens, or a function from worlds\nto sets, or a kind, or, as Peirce maintained, a law? These options are\ndiscussed in \u00a74.1. At a more specific level, \u201cwhat is a\ntype?\u201d is a request for a theory that would shed some light on\nthe identity conditions for specific types of types, not necessarily\nall of them. It would yield an account of what a word (or a symphony,\na species, a disease, etc.) is. This is in many ways a more difficult\nthing to do. To see just how difficult it is to give the identity\nconditions for an individual type, \u00a74.2 considers what a word is,\nboth because words are our paradigm of types, since the\ntype-token distinction is generally illustrated by means of words, and\nbecause doing so will show that some of the most common assumptions\nmade about types and their tokens are not correct. It will also\nilluminate some of the things we want from a theory of types.\n",
