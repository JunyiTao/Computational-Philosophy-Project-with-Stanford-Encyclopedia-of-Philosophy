    "main_text": "Was Hume an Atheist?\n11. Irreligion and the Unity of Hume\u2019s Philosophy\n\nIn the previous section it was suggested that Hume may be properly\ndescribed as a hard sceptic who is a non-dogmatic atheist. It remains\nan open question, however, whether \u201catheism\u201d is the most\nsuitable label for Hume\u2019s general position on this subject\n\u2013 apt as it may be. One important consideration here is that\nHume\u2019s (apparent) concessions to theism in the last section of\nthe Dialogues are indicative of significant features of his\npractical aims and objectives. More specifically, Hume\u2019s final\nposition is not aggressively atheistic in any familiar sense,\nnot only because it is non-dogmatic, but also because his final\nposition is one that aims to reconcile a broad group of\nviews. According to Hume\u2019s analysis, the practical\nconsequences of both soft and hard scepticism, as well as thin theism,\nare all much the same. While the thin theist may want to emphasize the\n(remote) basis for some inference to a being that resembles human\nintelligence, they must nevertheless grant that we are left in a state\nof \u201cprofound ignorance\u201d with a (weak and vague) idea that\ncannot serve to guide our lives in any way (D, 12.33/227). This\nreturns us to a point that Hume had made earlier in the\nDialogues; namely, that in both theoretical and practical\nterms a mystical form of theism \u2013 lacking any significant\nanthropomorphic features \u2013 is indistinguishable from a form of\nscepticism, where all conjectures about the nature of God remain\nentirely undecided, unknowable and irrelevant to human life (D,\n6.1/158, 12.7/217). With this general point in mind, Hume is happy to\nemphasize the \u201cverbal\u201d nature of the dispute among those\nwho may fall on the spectrum lying between thin theism and\nnon-dogmatic hard scepticism (D, 12.6-7/216-7). What really matters,\nHume suggests, is that the falsehoods, frauds, hypocrisies and\ncruelties of religion in the various (robust) forms that it almost\nalways takes are firmly resisted and rejected. This is a point that\nboth hard and soft skeptics, as well those who embrace religion of a\ngenuinely \u201cphilosophical and rational kind\u201d (D, 12.13/\n220), can all accept.\n\nGiven the more open-ended and inclusive nature of Hume\u2019s outlook\nand aims, the label of \u201catheism\u201d perhaps suggests a more\nnarrow and doctrinaire position than Hume is comfortable with or\nconcerned to champion. Granted that the label of \u201catheism\u201d\nis in these respects potentially misleading, and that\n\u201cscepticism\u201d and \u201cagnosticism\u201d fail to\nproperly identify and highlight Hume\u2019s wholly hostile and\ncritical attitude towards religious dogma and doctrine (in its\northodox forms), what alternative label is available to us? The most\naccurate and informative label for describing Hume\u2019s views on\nthis subject is perhaps irreligion. This is a term that both\nHume\u2019s contemporaries and our own would understand and can apply\nto Hume\u2019s arguments and outlook without any serious\nmisrepresentation. On one side, calling Hume\u2019s views on this\nsubject irreligious avoids any connotations of a dogmatic or rigid\natheism, one that is unwilling to accommodate or make common cause\nwith soft scepticism (agnosticism) or thin theism. On the other side,\nthe label of irreligion also makes clear that Hume\u2019s fundamental\nattitude towards religion (qua various forms of robust theism) is one\nof systematic hostility \u2013 that is, he believes we are\nbetter off without religion and religious hypotheses and\nspeculations.\n\nThe term irreligion has several other specific advantages. This term\nmakes clear that it is not simply (robust) \u201ctheism\u201d that\nHume aims to discredit and undermine but religion broadly conceived as\nincluding related doctrines (miracles, a future state, etc.) and\ninstitutions (church, clergy, etc.). The label of irreligion serves\neffectively to identify these wider concerns and places appropriate\nemphasis on Hume\u2019s destructive intent to leave religious\ndoctrine without any solid philosophical grounds or significant\ncontent \u2013 much less any practical value or influence. Related to\nthis point, by widening our scope of interest in religion, and\navoiding a narrow focus on arguments concerning the existence of God,\nwe are encouraged to consider works other than the Dialogues\nwhen assessing the nature and character of Hume\u2019s views on this\nsubject. It is, for example, especially important that proper weight\nbe given to Hume\u2019s effort in the Treatise to discredit\nthe metaphysical and moral paraphernalia of traditional theistic\nsystems and to redirect our philosophical investigations to \u201cthe\nstudy of man\u201d, whereby we may develop a secular, scientific\naccount of the true foundations of moral and social life. Insofar as\nwe consider Hume\u2019s views as advancing a \u201cphilosophy of\nirreligion\u201d, rather than simply atheism, we are more likely to\ncapture these more diverse, complex and subtle aspects of his thinking\non this subject. More importantly, when we consider Hume\u2019s\nthought from the point of view of the wider framework of irreligion,\nand not just the question of the existence of God, we are better\nplaced to recognize that his critique of religion constitutes the\nunifying motivation and central theme running throughout his entire\nphilosophy.\n",
