    "main_text": "Types of Argumentation || Consensus-oriented argumentation\n3.3 Consensus-oriented argumentation\n\nAnother important strand in the literature on argumentation are\ntheories that view consensus as the primary goal of\nargumentative processes: to eliminate or resolve a difference of\n(expressed) opinion. The tradition of pragma-dialectics is a prominent\nrecent exponent of this strand (Eemeren & Grootendorst 2004).\nThese consensus-oriented approaches are motivated by the social\ncomplexity of human life, and the attribution of a role of social\ncoordination to argumentation. Because humans are social animals who\nmust often cooperate with other humans to successfully accomplish\ncertain tasks, they must have mechanisms to align their beliefs and\nintentions, and subsequently their actions (Tomasello 2014). The\nthought is that argumentation would be a particularly suitable\nmechanism for such alignment, as an exchange of reasons would make it\nmore likely that differences of opinion would decrease (Norman 2016).\nThis may happen precisely because argumentation would be a good way to\ntrack truths and avoid falsehoods, as discussed in the previous\nsection; by being involved in the same epistemic process of exchanging\nreasons, the participants in an argumentative situation would all come\nto converge towards the truth, and thus the upshot would be that they\nalso come to agree with each other. However, consensus-oriented views\nneed not presuppose that argumentation is truth-conducive: the\nultimate goal of such instances of argumentation is that of social\ncoordination, and for this tracking truth is not a requirement\n(Patterson 2011).\n\nIn particular, the very notion of deliberative democracy is\nviewed as resting crucially on argumentative practices that aim for\nconsensus (Fishkin 2016; see entry on\n democracy).\n (For present purposes, \u201cdeliberation\u201d and\n\u201cargumentation\u201d can be treated as roughly synonymous). In\na deliberative democracy, for a decision to be legitimate, it must be\npreceded by authentic public deliberation\u2014a discussion of the\npros and cons of the different options\u2014not merely the\naggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. Moreover, in\ndemocratic deliberation, when full consensus does not emerge, the\nparties involved may opt for a compromise solution, e.g., a\ncoalition-based political system.\n\nA prominent theorist of deliberative democracy thus understood is\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas, whose \u201cdiscourse theory of law and\ndemocracy\u201d relies heavily on practices of political\njustification and argumentation taking place in what he calls\n\u201cthe public sphere\u201d (Habermas 1992 [1996]; 1981 [1984];\nsee entry on\n Habermas).\n He starts from the idea that politics allows for the collective\norganization of people\u2019s lives, including the common rules they\nwill live by. Political argumentation is a form of communicative\npractice, so general assumptions for communicative practices in\ngeneral apply. However, additional assumptions apply as well (Olson\n2011 [2014]). In particular, deliberating participants must accept\nthat anyone can participate in these discursive practices (democratic\ndeliberation should be inclusive), and that anyone can introduce and\nchallenge claims that are made in the public sphere (democratic\ndeliberation should be free). They must also see one another as having\nequal status, at least for the purposes of deliberation (democratic\ndeliberation should be equal). In turn, critics of Habermas\u2019s\naccount view it as unrealistic, as it presupposes an ideal situation\nwhere all citizens are treated equally and engage in public debates in\ngood faith (Mouffe 1999; Geuss 2019).\n\nMore generally, it seems that it is only under quite specific\nconditions that argumentation reliably leads to consensus (as also\nsuggested by formal modeling of argumentative situations (Betz 2013;\nOlsson 2013; M\u00e4s & Flache 2013)). Consensus-oriented\nargumentation seems to work well in cooperative contexts, but not so much in situations of conflict (Dutilh Novaes forthcoming). In\nparticular, the discussing parties must already have a significant\namount of background agreement\u2014especially agreement on what\ncounts as a legitimate argument or compelling evidence\u2014for\nargumentation and deliberation to lead to consensus. Especially in\nsituations of deep disagreement (Fogelin 1985), it seems that the\npotential of argumentation to lead to consensus is quite limited.\nInstead, in many real-life situations, argumentation often leads to\nthe opposite result; people disagree with each other even more after\nengaging in argumentation (Sunstein 2002). This is the well-documented\nphenomenon of group polarization, which occurs when an\ninitial position or tendency of individual members of a group becomes\nmore extreme after group discussion (Isenberg 1986).\n\nIn fact, it may be argued that argumentation will often create or\nexacerbate conflict and adversariality, rather than leading to the\nresolution of differences of opinions. Furthermore, a focus on\nconsensus may end up reinforcing and perpetuating existing unequal\npower relations in a society. \n\n\nIn an unjust society, what purports to be a cooperative exchange of\nreasons really perpetuates patterns of oppression. (Goodwin 2007: 77)\n\n\n\nThis general point has been made by a number of political thinkers\n(e.g., Young 2000), who have highlighted the exclusionary implications\nof consensus-oriented political deliberation. The upshot is that\nconsensus may not only be an unrealistic goal for argumentation; it\nmay not even be a desirable goal for argumentation in a\nnumber of situations (e.g., when there is great power imbalance).\nDespite these concerns, the view that the primary goal of\nargumentation is to aim for consensus remains influential in the\nliterature.\n",
