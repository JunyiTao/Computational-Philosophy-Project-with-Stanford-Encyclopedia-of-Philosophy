    "main_text": "Special topics || Negative information\n6. Conclusion\n\nThere is a bi-directional relation between logic and information. On\nthe one hand, information underlies the intuitive understanding of\nstandard logical notions such as inference (which may be thought of as\nthe process that turns implicit information into explicit informaiton)\nand computation. On the other hand, logic provides a formal framework\nfor the study of information itself.\n\nThe logical study of information focuses on some of the most\nfundamental qualitative aspects of information. Different stances on\ninformation naturally highlight some of these aspects more than\nothers. Thus, the information-as-range stance most naturally\nhighlights agency and the dynamics of information in settings with\nmultiple agents that can interact with each other. The aboutness of\ninformation (information is always about something) is a central theme\nin the information-as-correlation stance. The topic of encoding\ninformation and its processing (as in the case of formal inference) is\nat the core of the information-as-code stance. None of these\nqualitative aspects of information is exclusive to just one of the\nstances, even if some stress certain topics more than others. Some\nthemes such as the structure of information and its relation with\ninformation content are equally pertinent regardless of the stance.\nThe ways in which information is studied in this entry differs from\nother important formal frameworks that study information\nquantitatively. For example, Shannon\u2019s statistical theory of\ninformation is concerned with things such as optimizing the amount of\ndata that can be transmitted via a noisy channel, and the\nKolmogorov\u2019s complexity theory quantifies the informational\ncomplexity of a string as the length of the shortest program that\noutputs it when executed by a fixed universal Turing machine.\n\nThe logical analysis of information includes fruitful\nreinterpretations of known logical systems (such as epistemic logic or\nrelevance logic), and new systems that result from attempts to capture\nfurther aspects of information. Still other logical approaches to the\nanalysis of information result from combining aspects of two different\nstances, as with the constraint systems of\n section 4.\n New frameworks (situation theory in the 80s) have also resulted from\nexploring from scratch what sort of inferences \u2014 including those\nthat are novel and non-classical \u2014 one should allow in order to\nmodel certain aspects of information.\n\nLooking for interfaces between the three stances is still a nascent\ndirection of inquiry, discussed here in\n section 4.\n A complementary issue is whether the stances can be unified. There\nare several formal frameworks that, beyond serving as potential\nsettings for exploring the issue of unification, are abstract\nmathematical theories of information in their own right. Each of these\ngoes well beyond the scope of this entry:\n\nDomain Theory (Abramsky and Jung 1994): it has been used to study\nthe processes of unraveling or \u201cimprovement\u201d of\ninformational states in terms of partial orderings of information\nstates that naturally arise across the stances.\nPoint-free topology: it has deep connections with computer science\nand it can actually be motivated as a logic of information (Vickers\n1996).\nChu Spaces (Pratt 1995): in category theory they are presented as\ngeneralizations of topologies. The immediate link with things\ndiscussed in this entry is that the classifications used in situation\ntheory are simply Chu spaces, discovered independently and with\ndifferent aims.\nCoalgebra: another branch of category theory that has also been\npresented as the \u201cmathematics of sets and observations\u201d\n(Jacobs 2012, Other Internet Resources). This framework has strong\nlinks with many notions discussed in this entry, in particular modal\nlogic\n (section 1)\n and bisimulation\n (section 5.1).\nProbability Theory: it is clearly at the center of abstract\nquantitative approaches to information. Various versions of\nthe inverse relationship principle that lead to measures of\nsemantic information (see\n section 1.3\n and Floridi 2013) descend from the version used by Shannon (1953\n[1950]): in a communication setting via noisy channels, the less\nexpected a received message is, the more informative it is.\n\n\nThe logical study of information resembles in spirit other more\ntraditional endeavours, such as the logical study of the concept of\ntruth or computation: in all these cases the object of logical study\nplays a central role in the intuitive understanding of logic itself.\nThe three perspectives on qualitative information presented in this\nentry (ranges, correlations, and code) portrait the diverse state of\nthe art in this field, where many directions of research are open,\nboth as a way of searching for unifying or interfacing settings for\nthe different stances, and of deepening the understanding of the main\nqualitative features of information (dynamics, aboutness, encoding,\ninteraction, etc.) within each stance itself.\n\nInterested readers may wish to pursue the topics in the supplementary\ndocument\n\nAbstract Approaches to Information Structure\n\n\nwhich covers the topics\n intuitionistic logic, Beth and Kripke models,\n and\n algebraic and other approaches to modal information theory and related areas.\n",
