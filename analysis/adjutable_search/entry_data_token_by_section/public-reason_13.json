    "main_text": "Objections || Self-Defeating\n7.2 Self-Defeating\n\nThe idea of public reason tells us that, for some set of moral or\npolitical rules, the rules in question are not legitimate, or lack\nnormative authority, unless the rules in question can be justified, or\nare reasonably acceptable, to all those to whom the rules apply. Some\ncritics argue that the idea of public reason is self-defeating because\nthe idea itself cannot be justified to all those to whom the idea\napplies (Enoch 2013, 170\u201373; Mang 2017; Raz 1998, 29\u201330;\nWall 2002). Public reason, the critic points out, is a moral or\npolitical rule like any other, and so surely it ought to be subject to\nthe same test of moral and political rules which proponents of public\nreason advocate. But, the critic continues, the idea of public reason\nwill be unable to pass this test.\n\nThere are, broadly, two ways one might defend the idea of public\nreason from this objection. First, one might deny that the idea of\npublic reason does indeed apply to itself. On some formulations, the\nidea of public reason is a constraint on the exercise of political\npower, or a constraint on the exercise of coercion, but not itself an\nexercise of political power, nor an exercise of coercion. When the\nproponent of public reason states that political or moral rules must\nbe publicly justifiably to be legitimate, she does not exert power or\ncoercion over anyone, she merely states a condition that any\npurportedly legitimate exercises of power or coercion must meet to be\nlegitimate (Bajaj 2017). The success of this reply, however, may\ndepend on a controversial presumption in favor of states of affairs\nwhere political power or coercion is not exercised. It seems to\nassume, for example, that refusals to aid others, and other\nnon-coercive choices, need not meet the test of public reason.\nProponents of public reason might also argue that the principle of\npublic reason does not apply to itself because it is a\n\u201cmeta\u201d claim about the appropriate conditions for moral or\npolitical justification, and not a first order normative claim within\nthat discourse (Gaus 2011, 227\u2013228). But this line of reply is\nalso open to challenge, since the idea of public reason does sometimes\nappear to operate as a first order normative claim, for example, it\ncan be deployed to justify why one person cannot permissibly coerce\nanother, or why the latter person is justified in forcefully resisting\nthat coercion.\n\nThe second way to defend public reason from the objection is to\nconcede that the idea ought to apply to itself (Estlund 1998) and\nargue that it does so successfully. This strategy might be pursued in\nseveral ways. The proponent of public reason may point to some\nallegedly public or shared ideal\u2014moral autonomy or respect for\npersons\u2014and argue that this ideal both justifies a commitment to\npublic reason and is publicly justifiable by virtue of being a\nsuitably public or shared ideal. This strategy, however, faces two\nrelated challenges. If the ideal in question is formulated in a\nsufficiently detailed or rich way, such that a commitment to public\nreason is plausibly entailed by the ideal, then the ideal runs the\nrisk of being one that is no longer suitably public or shared. This\ndefense thus runs the risk of grounding public reason in some\nreasonably contested moral ideal or claim about philosophical truth,\nthough some argue this is the only appropriate way to defend the idea\n(Estlund 1998). On the other hand, if the alleged ideal is pitched at\na level of abstraction that ensures it does remain suitably public, it\nmay no longer be obvious that the ideal does in fact entail a\ncommitment to public reason (Wall 2002, 390\u2013391). Alternatively,\na proponent might argue that public reason can successfully meet its\nown test by appeal to a convergence form of justification. On this\nview, the idea of public reason is justifiable or acceptable to all\nthe relevant members of the constituency because each member has his\nor her own nonpublic reasons to accept the idea. For example, all\nreasonable people might converge on the importance of the value of\njustice for nonpublic reasons, and then the advocate of public reason\nneed only establish that justice, at least under conditions of\nreasonable pluralism, requires a commitment to public reason (see\nsect. 1.5 above). But this line of response may be vulnerable to the\ncharge that it can only succeed by stipulation\u2014by defining the\nrelevant members of the constituency as those who converge on the\nimportance of public reason (Mang 2017).\n",
