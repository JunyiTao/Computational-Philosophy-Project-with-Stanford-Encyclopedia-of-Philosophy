He made significant contributions to\nphilosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of\nscience, decision theory, epistemology, meta-ethics and aesthetics. In\nmost of these fields he is essential reading; in many of them he is\namong the most important figures of recent decades. And this list\nleaves out his two most significant contributions.\n\nIn philosophy of mind, Lewis developed and defended at length a new\nversion of materialism (see the entry on\n physicalism).\n He started by showing how the motivations driving the identity theory\nof mind and\n functionalism\n could be reconciled in his theory of mind. He called this an identity\ntheory, though his theory motivated the position now known as\n analytic functionalism.\n And he developed detailed accounts of mental content (building on\nDavidson\u2019s\n interpretationism)\n and phenomenal knowledge (building on Nemirow\u2019s\n ability hypothesis)\n that are consistent with his materialism. The synthesis Lewis ended\nup with is one of the central positions in contemporary debates in\nphilosophy of mind.\n\nBut his largest contributions were in metaphysics. One branch of his\nmetaphysics was his Hume-inspired reductionism about the nomological.\nHe developed a position he called \u201cHumean supervenience\u201d,\nthe theory that said that there was nothing to reality except the\nspatio-temporal distribution of local natural properties. And he did\nthis by showing in detail how\n laws, chances,\n counterfactual dependence,\n causation,\n dispositions and colours could be located within this Humean mosaic.\nThe other branch of his metaphysics was his\n modal realism.\n Lewis held that the best theory of modality posited concrete possible\nworlds. A proposition is possible if and only if it is true at one of\nthese worlds. Lewis defended this view in his most significant book,\nOn the Plurality of Worlds. Alongside this, Lewis developed a\nnew account of how to think about modal properties of individuals,\nnamely\n counterpart theory,\n and showed how this theory resolved several long-standing puzzles\nabout modal properties.\n", "toc": [{"#1": "1.

Lewis\u2019s Life and Influence\n\nAs we\u2019ve already seen, part of Lewis\u2019s significance came\nfrom the breadth of subject matter on which he made major\ncontributions. It is hard to think of a philosopher since Hume who has\ncontributed so much to so many fields. And in all of these cases,\nLewis\u2019s contributions involved defending, or in many cases\narticulating, a big picture theory of the subject matter, as well as\nan account of how the details worked. Because of all his work on the\ndetails of various subjects, his writings were a font of ideas even\nfor those who didn\u2019t agree with the bigger picture. And he was\nalmost invariably clear about which details were relevant only to his\nparticular big picture, and which were relevant to anyone who worked\non the subject.\n\nLewis was born in Oberlin, Ohio in 1941, to two academics. He was an\nundergraduate at Swarthmore College. During his undergraduate years,\nhis interest in philosophy was stimulated by a year abroad in Oxford,\nwhere he heard J. L. Austin\u2019s final series of lectures, and was\ntutored by Iris Murdoch. He returned to Swarthmore as a philosophy\nmajor, and never looked back. He studied at Harvard for his Ph.D.,\nwriting a dissertation under the supervision of W. V. O. Quine that\nbecame his first book, Convention. In 1966 he was hired at\nUCLA, where he worked until 1970, when he moved to Princeton. He\nremained at Princeton until his death in 2001. While at Harvard he met\nhis wife Stephanie. They remained married throughout Lewis\u2019s\nlife, jointly attended numerous conferences, and co-authored three\npapers. Lewis visited Australia in 1971, 1975, every year from 1979 to\n1999, and again shortly before his death in 2001.\n\nLewis was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a\nCorresponding Fellow of the British Academy, and an Honorary Fellow of\nthe Australian Academy of the Humanities. He received honorary\ndoctorates from the University of Melbourne, the University of York in\nEngland, and Cambridge University. His Erd\u00f6s number was 3.\n\nLewis published four books: Convention (1969a),\nCounterfactuals (1973a), On the Plurality of Worlds\n(1986a) and Parts of Classes (1991a). His numerous papers\nhave been largely collected in five volumes: Philosophical Papers\nVol. I (1983a), Philosophical Papers Vol. II (1986b),\nPapers in Philosophical Logic (1998a), Papers in\nMetaphysics and Epistemology (1999a) and Papers in Social\nPhilosophy (2000a). This entry starts with a discussion of\nLewis\u2019s first two books, then looks at his contributions to\nphilosophy of mind. Sections 5 and 6 are on his metaphysics, looking\nin turn at Humean Supervenience and modal realism. Section 7 looks\nvery briefly at some of the many works that aren\u2019t been covered\nin the previous five categories.\n2. Convention\n\nDavid Lewis\u2019s first book was Convention (1969a; note\nthat all citations are to works by David Lewis, unless explicitly\nstated otherwise). It was based on his Harvard Ph. D. thesis, and\npublished in 1969. The book was an extended argument that language\ncould be entirely grounded in convention. There is a simple argument\nthat this could not be so. Conventions are formed by agreement,\nagreements are made in language, so language must precede convention,\nnot be grounded in convention. (In the foreward Quine contributes to\nConvention, Quine appears to express some sympathy for this\nargument.) Lewis\u2019s response is to deny that conventions require\nanything like an agreement. Rather, on his view, conventions are\nregularities in action that solve co-ordination problems. We can\nstumble into such a regularity without ever agreeing to do so. And\nsuch a regularity can persist simply because it is in everyone\u2019s\nbest interest that it persist.\n2.1 Analysis of Convention\n\nLewis viewed conventions as solutions to co-ordination problems (see\nSection 3.2 of the entry on\n convention).\n His thinking about these problems was heavily influenced by Thomas\nSchelling\u2019s work on co-operative games in The Strategy of\nConflict (Schelling 1960). Many of the key ideas in Lewis\u2019s\nbook come from game theory.\n\nThe simplest cases in which conventions arise are ones where we are\nrepeatedly playing a game that is purely co-operative, i.e. the\npayoffs to each agent are the same, and there are multiple equilibria.\nIn such a case, we may well hope for the equilibrium to persist. At\nthe very least, we will prefer the persistence of the equilibrium to\nany one person deviating from it. And we will have this preference\neven if we would prefer, all things considered, to be in some other\nequilibrium state. In such a case, there may well be a practice of\ncontinuing to play one\u2019s part in the equilibrium that has been\nreached. This is a regularity in action\u2014it involves making moves\nin the repeated game. Given that everyone else is following the\nregularity, each agent has a reason to follow the regularity;\notherwise it wouldn\u2019t be an equilibrium. But if other agents\nacted differently, agents would not be interested in following the\nregularity, since there are alternative equilibria. Because these\nthree conditions are met, Lewis argued that the practice is really a\nconvention, even if there was never any explicit agreement to continue\nit.\n\nThe case we started with was restricted in two important ways. First,\nthe case involved games that were perfectly repeated. Second, it\ninvolved games where the payoffs were perfectly symmetric.\nLewis\u2019s theory of convention involved getting rid of both\nrestrictions.\n\nInstead of focussing on repeated co-ordination problems, Lewis just\nfocussed on repeated situations which collectively constitute a\nco-ordination problem. Lewis does not identify situations with games.\nA repeated situation may come in different \u2018versions\u2019,\neach of which is represented by a different game. For example, it may\nbe that the costs of performing some kind of action differ on\ndifferent occasions, so the formal game will be different, but the\ndifferences are small enough that it makes sense to have a common\npractice. And Lewis does not require that there be identity of\ninterests. In Convention he does require that there be large\noverlap of interests, but this requirement does not do much work, and\nis abandoned in later writing. With those requirements weakened, we\nget the following definition of convention.\n\nA regularity R in the behaviour of members of a population\nP when they are agents in a recurrent situation S is\na convention if and only if it is true that, and it is common\nknowledge in P that, in almost any instance of S\namong members of P,\n\n\nalmost everyone conforms to R;\nalmost everyone expects everyone else to conform to\nR;\nalmost everyone has approximately the same preferences regarding\nall possible combinations of actions;\nalmost everyone prefers that any one more conform to R,\non condition that almost everyone conform to R;\nalmost everyone would prefer that any one more conform to\nR\u2032, on condition that almost everyone conform to\nR\u2032,\n\n\nwhere R\u2032 is some possible regularity in the behaviour\nof members of P in S, such that almost no one in\nalmost any instance of S among members of P could\nconform to both R\u2032 and to R. (Lewis 1969:\n78)\n\n\nThis is clearly a vague definition, with many \u2018almost\u2019s\nscattered throughout. But Lewis, characteristically, thought this was\na feature not a bug of the view. Our intuitive notion of a convention\nis vague, and any analysis of it should capture the vagueness. The\nidea that analyses of imprecise folk concepts should be imprecise\nrecurs throughout Lewis\u2019s career.\n\nThe notion of \u2018common knowledge\u2019 that Lewis is working\nwith here is not the standard modern notion. Lewis does not require\nthat everyone know that everyone know etc., that all of these\nconditions hold. Rather, when Lewis says that it is common knowledge\nthat p, he means that everyone has a reason to believe that\np, and everyone has a reason to believe everyone has a reason\nto believe that p, and everyone has a reason to believe that\neveryone has a reason to believe everyone has a reason to believe that\np, and so on. That people act on these reasons, or are known\nto act on these reasons, to form beliefs is unnecessary. And that the\nbeliefs people would get if they acted on their reasons are true is\nalso not part of the view. Hence it is necessary to specify truth as\nwell as common belief in the definition.\n\nLewis argues that this definition captures many of our ordinary\nconventions, such as the convention of driving on the right side of\nthe road in the United States, the convention of taking certain pieces\nof paper as payments for debts, and, most importantly, the conventions\ngoverning the use of language.\n2.2 Conventions of Language\n\nIn the final chapter of Convention, Lewis gives his theory of\nwhat it is for a community to speak a language (see the section on\nconventional theories of meaning in the entry on\n convention),\n i.e., for a community to have adopted one language as their language\nby convention. Lewis individuates languages largely by the truth\nconditions they assign to sentences. And his account of truth\nconditions is given in terms of possible worlds. So the truth\ncondition of an indicative sentence is the set of possible worlds in\nwhich it is true. Somewhat more abnormally, Lewis takes the truth\ncondition for an imperative to be the set of possible worlds in which\nthe imperative is obeyed. (The account of language in\nConvention covers many different moods, but we will focus\nhere on the account of indicatives.)\n\nThe focus on truth conditions is not because Lewis thinks truth\nconditions are all that there are to languages. He acknowledges that\nlanguages also have \u2018grammars\u2019. A grammar, in\nLewis\u2019s sense, is a lexicon (i.e. a set of elementary\nconstituents, along with their interpretation), a generative component\n(i.e. rules for combining constituents into larger constituents), and\na representing component (i.e. rules for verbally expressing\nconstituents). Lewis\u2019s preferred interpretations are functions\nfrom possible worlds to extensions. So we can sensibly talk about the\nmeaning of a non-sentential constituent of the language, but these\nmeanings are derived from the truth conditions of sentences, rather\nthan determining the meanings of sentences. That\u2019s because, as\nwe\u2019ll see, what the conventions of language establish in the\nfirst instance are truth conditions for entire messages, i.e.,\nsentences.\n\nGiven this understanding of what a language is, Lewis goes on to say\nwhat it is for a population to speak a language. One natural approach\nwould be to say that speakers and hearers face a co-ordination\nproblem, and settling on one language to communicate in would be a\nsolution to that problem. When Lewis is analysing signalling, that is\nthe approach he takes. But he doesn\u2019t think it will work for\nlanguage in general. The reason is that he takes conventions to be\nregularities in action, and it is hard to say in general what actions\nare taken by hearers.\n\nSo instead Lewis says that a population P speaks a language\nL if and only if there is a convention of speaking truthfully\nin L that persists amongst P. The parties to the\nco-ordination problem (and the convention that solves it) are the\ndifferent people who want to communicate in P. They solve\ntheir problem by speaking truthfully (on the whole) in L.\n\nIt might be wondered whether it could really be a convention to speak\ntruthfully in L. After all, there is no obvious alternative\nto speaking truthfully. As Lewis points out, however, there are many\nnatural alternatives to speaking truthfully in L; we could\nspeak truthfully in L\u2032 instead. The existence of\nalternative languages makes our use of L conventional. And\nthe convention can be established, and persist, without anyone\nagreeing to it.\n2.3 Later Revisions\n\nIn \u201cLanguages and Language\u201d (1975b), Lewis makes two major\nrevisions to the picture presented in Convention. He changes\nthe account of what a convention is, and he changes the account of\njust what convention must obtain in order for a population to speak a\nlanguage.\n\nThere are two changes to the account of convention. First, Lewis now\nsays that conventions may be regularities in action and belief, rather\nthan just in action. Second, he weakens the third condition, which was\napproximate sameness of preferences, to the condition that (almost)\neach agent has a reason to conform when they believe others conform.\nThe reason in question may be a practical reason, when conformity\nrequires action, or an epistemic reason, when convention requires\nbelief.\n\nIn Convention, the conventions that sustained language were\nregularities amongst speakers. As we noted, it would be more natural\nto say that the conventions solved co-ordination problems between\nspeakers of a language and their hearers. That is what the new account\nof what it is for a population to speak a language does. The\npopulation P speaks the language L iff there are\nconventions of truthfulness and trust in L. Speakers are\ntruthful in L if and only if they only utter sentences they\nbelieve are true sentences of L. Hearers are trusting in\nL if and only if they take the sentences they hear to be\n(generally) true sentences of L.\n\nThe old account took linguistic conventions to be grounded in\nco-ordination between speakers generally. We each communicate in\nEnglish because we think we\u2019ll be understood that way given\neveryone else communicates that way, and we want to be understood. In\nthe new account there is still this kind of many-way co-ordination\nbetween all the speakers of a language, but the most basic kind of\nco-ordination is a two-way co-ordination between individual speakers,\nwho want to be understood, and hearers, who want to understand. This\nseems like a more natural starting point. The new account also makes\nit possible for someone to be part of a population that uses a\nlanguage even if they don\u2019t say anything because they\ndon\u2019t have anything to say. As long as they are trusting in\nL, they are part of the population that conforms to the\nlinguistic regularity.\n\nJohn Hawthorne (1990) argued that Lewis\u2019s account cannot explain\nthe intuitive meaning of very long sentences. While not accepting all\nof Hawthorne\u2019s reasons as to why very long sentences are a\nproblem, in \u201cMeaning Without Use: Reply to Hawthorne\u201d\n(1992a) Lewis agreed that such sentences pose a problem to his view.\nTo see the problem, let L be the function from each sentence\nof English to its intuitive truth condition, and let L* be\nthe restriction of that function to sentences that aren\u2019t very\nlong. Arguably we do not trust speakers who utter very long sentences\nto have uttered truths, under the ordinary English interpretation of\ntheir sentences. We think, as Lewis said, that such speakers are\n\u201ctrying to win a bet or set a record, or feigning madness or\nraving for real, or doing it to annoy, or filibustering, or making an\nexperiment to test the limits of what it is humanly possible to say\nand mean.\u201d (Lewis 1992a: 108) That means that while there may be\na convention of truthfulness and trust in L*, there is no\nconvention of trust in L in its full generality. So the\n\u201cLanguages and Language\u201d theory implies that we speak\nL*, not L, which is wrong.\n\nLewis\u2019s solution to this puzzle relies on his theory of natural\nproperties, described below in Section 4.6. He argues that some\ngrammars (in the above sense of grammar) are more natural than others.\nBy default, we speak a language with a natural grammar. Since\nL has a natural grammar, and L* doesn\u2019t, other\nthings being equal, we should be interpreted as speaking L\nrather than L*. Even if other things are not quite equal,\ni.e. we don\u2019t naturally trust speakers of very long sentences,\nif there is a convention of truthfulness and trust in L in\nthe vast majority of verbal interactions, and there is no other\nlanguage with a natural grammar in which there is a convention of\ntruthfulness and truth, then the theory will hold, correctly, that we\ndo speak L.\n3. Counterfactuals\n\nDavid Lewis\u2019s second book was Counterfactuals (1973a).\nCounterfactual conditionals were important to Lewis for several\nreasons. Most obviously, they are a distinctive part of natural\nlanguage and it is philosophically interesting to figure out how they\nwork. But counterfactuals would play a large role in Lewis\u2019s\nmetaphysics. Many of Lewis\u2019s attempted reductions of nomic or\nmental concepts would be either directly in terms of counterfactuals,\nor in terms of concepts (such as causation) that he in turn defined in\nterms of counterfactuals. And the analysis of counterfactuals, which\nuses possible worlds, would in turn provide motivation for believing\nin possible worlds. We will look at these two metaphysical motivations\nin more detail in section 4, where we discuss the relationship between\ncounterfactuals and laws, causation and other high-level concepts, and\nin section 5, where we discuss the motivations for Lewis\u2019s modal\nmetaphysics.\n3.1 Background\n\nTo the extent that there was a mid-century orthodoxy about\ncounterfactual conditionals, it was given by the proposal in Nelson\nGoodman (1955). Goodman proposed that counterfactual conditionals were\na particular variety of strict conditional. To a first approximation,\nIf it were the case that p, it would be the case that\nq (hereafter p \u25a1\u2192 q) is true\njust in case Necessarily, either p is false or q is\ntrue, i.e. \u25a1(p \u2283 q). Goodman realised that\nthis wouldn\u2019t work if the modal \u2018necessarily\u2019 was\ninterpreted unrestrictedly. He first suggested that we needed to\nrestrict attention to those possibilities where all facts\n\u2018co-tenable\u2019 with p were true. More formally, if\nS is the conjunction of all the co-tenable facts, then p\n\u25a1\u2192 q is true if and only if \u25a1((p\n\u2227 S) \u2283 q).\n\nLewis argued that this could not be the correct set of truth\nconditions for p \u25a1\u2192 q in general. His\nargument was that strict conditionals were in a certain sense\nindefeasible. If a strict conditional is true, then adding more\nconjuncts to the antecedent cannot make it false. But intuitively,\nadding conjuncts to the antecedent of a counterfactual can change it\nfrom being true to false. Indeed, intuitively we can have long\nsequences of counterfactuals of ever increasing strength in the\nantecedent, but with the same consequent, that alternate in truth\nvalue. So we can imagine that (3.1) and (3.3) are true, while (3.2)\nand (3.4) are false.\n\n(3.1) If Smith gets the most votes, he will be the next mayor.\n\n\n(3.2) If Smith gets the most votes but is disqualified due to\nelectoral fraud, he will be the next mayor.\n\n(3.3) If Smith gets the most votes, but is disqualified due to\nelectoral fraud, then launches a military coup that overtakes the city\ngovernment, he will be the next mayor.\n\n(3.4) If Smith gets the most votes, but is disqualified due to\nelectoral fraud, then launches a military coup that overtakes the city\ngovernment, but dies during the coup, he will be the next mayor.\n\n\nIf we are to regard p \u25a1\u2192 q as true if and\nonly if \u25a1((p \u2227 S) \u2283 q), then the S\nmust vary for different values of p. More seriously, we have\nto say something about how S varies with variation in\np. Goodman\u2019s own attempts to resolve this problem had\ngenerally been regarded as unsuccessful, for reasons discussed in\nBennett (1984). So a new solution was needed.\n3.2 Analysis\n\nThe basic idea behind the alternative analysis was similar to that\nproposed by Robert Stalnaker (1968). Let\u2019s say that an\nA-world is simply a possible world where A is true.\nStalnaker had proposed that p \u25a1\u2192 q was\ntrue just in case the most similar p-world to the actual\nworld is also a q-world. Lewis offered a nice graphic way of\nthinking about this. He proposed that we think of similarity between\nworlds as a kind of metric, with the worlds arranged in some\nlarge-dimensional space, and more similar worlds being closer to each\nother than more dissimilar worlds. Then Stalnaker\u2019s idea is that\nthe closest p-world has to be a q-world for\np \u25a1\u2192 q to be true. Lewis considered\nseveral ways of filling out the details of this proposal, three of\nwhich will be significant here.\n\nFirst, he rejected Stalnaker\u2019s presupposition that there is a\nmost similar p-world to actuality. He thought there might be\nmany worlds which are equally similar to actuality, with no\np-world being more similar. Using the metric analogy\nsuggested above, these worlds all fall on a common\n\u2018sphere\u2019 of worlds, where the centre of this sphere is the\nactual world. In such a case, Lewis held that p \u25a1\u2192\nq is true if and only if all the p-worlds on this\nsphere are q-worlds. One immediate consequence of this is\nthat Conditional Excluded Middle, i.e., (p \u25a1\u2192\nq) \u2228 (p \u25a1\u2192 ~q) is not a\ntheorem of counterfactual logic for Lewis, as it was for\nStalnaker.\n\nSecond, he rejected the idea that there must even be a sphere of\nclosest p-worlds. There might, he thought, be closer and\ncloser p-worlds without limit. He called the assumption that\nthere was a sphere of closest worlds the \u201cLimit\nAssumption\u201d, and noted that we could do without it. The new\ntruth conditions are that p \u25a1\u2192 q is true\nat w if and only if there is a p \u2227\nq-world closer to w than any p \u2227\n\u00acq-world, or that there is no p world.\n\nThird, he considered dropping the assumption that w is closer to\nitself than any other world, or even the assumption that w is among\nthe worlds that are closest to it. When we think in terms of\nsimilarity (or indeed of metrics) these assumptions seem perfectly\nnatural, but some philosophers have held that they have bad proof\ntheoretic consequences. Given the truth conditions Lewis adopts, the\nassumption that w is closer to itself than any other world is\nequivalent to the claim that p \u2227 q entails\np \u25a1\u2192 q, and the assumption that w is\namong the worlds that are closest to it is equivalent to the claim\nthat p \u25a1\u2192 q and p entail\nq. The first of these entailments in particular has been\nthought to be implausible. But Lewis ultimately decided to endorse it,\nin large part because of the semantic model he was using. When we\ndon\u2019t think about entailments, and instead simply ask ourselves\nwhether any other world could be as similar to w as w is to itself,\nthe answer seems clearly to be no.\n\nAs well as offering these semantic models for counterfactuals, in the\nbook Lewis offers an axiomatisation of the counterfactual logic he\nprefers (see Table 6 in Section 3.3 of the entry\n logic of conditionals),\n as well as axiomatisations for several other logics that make\ndifferent choices about some of the assumptions we\u2019ve discussed\nhere. And he has proofs that these axiomatisations are sound and\ncomplete with respect to the described semantics.\n\nHe also notes that his preferred counterfactual logic invalidates\nseveral familiar implications involving conditionals. We already\nmentioned that strengthening the antecedent, the implication of\n(p \u2227 r) \u25a1\u2192 q by p\n\u25a1\u2192 q, is invalid on Lewis\u2019s theory, and gave\nsome natural language examples that suggest that it should be invalid.\nLewis also shows that contraposition, the implication of ~q\n\u25a1\u2192 ~p by p \u25a1\u2192 q, and\nconditional syllogism, the implication of p \u25a1\u2192\nr by p \u25a1\u2192 q and q\n\u25a1\u2192 r, are invalid on his model, and gives\narguments that they should be considered invalid.\n3.3 Similarity\n\nIn Counterfactuals, Lewis does not say a lot about similarity\nof worlds. He has some short arguments that we can make sense of the\nnotion of two worlds being similar. And he notes that on different\noccasions we may wish to use different notions of similarity,\nsuggesting a kind of context dependency of counterfactuals. But the\nnotion is not spelled out in much more detail.\n\nSome reactions to the book showed that Lewis needed to say more here.\nKit Fine (1975) argued that given what Lewis had said to date, (3.5)\nwould be false, when it should be true.\n\n(3.5) If Richard Nixon had pushed the button, there would have been a\nnuclear war.\n\n\n(\u2018The button\u2019 in question is the button designed to launch\nnuclear missiles.) The reason it would be false is that a world in\nwhich the mechanisms of nuclear warfare spontaneously failed but then\nlife went on as usual, would be more similar, all things considered,\nto actuality than a world in which the future consisted entirely of a\npost-nuclear apocalypse.\n\nIn \u201cCounterfactual Dependence and Time\u2019s Arrow\u201d\n(1979c), Lewis responded by saying more about the notion of\nsimilarity. In particular, he offered an algorithm for determining\nsimilarity in standard contexts. He still held that the particular\nmeasure of similarity in use on an occasion is context-sensitive, so\nthere is no one true measure of similarity. Nevertheless there is, he\nthought, a default measure that we use unless there is a reason to\navoid it. Here is how Lewis expressed this default measure.\n\nIt is of the first importance to avoid big, widespread, diverse\nviolations of law.\nIt is of the second importance to maximize the spatio-temporal\nregion throughout which perfect match of particular fact\nprevails.\nIt is of the third importance to avoid even small, localized,\nsimple violations of law.\nIt is of little or no importance to secure approximate similarity\nof particular fact, even in matters that concern us greatly. (Lewis\n1979c: 47\u20138)\n\n\nLewis argues that by this measure, worlds in which the mechanisms of\nnuclear warfare spontaneously fail will be less similar to the actual\nworld than the post-nuclear apocalypse. That\u2019s because the\nfailure of those mechanisms will either lead to divergence from the\nactual world (if they fail partially) or widespread, diverse\nviolations of law (if they fail completely). In the former case,\nthere\u2019s a violation of law that isn\u2019t made up for in an\nincrease in how much spatio-temporal match we get. In the latter case\nthe gain we get in similarity is only an expansion of the\nspatio-temporal region throughout which perfect match of particular\nfact prevails, but that doesn\u2019t help in getting us closer to\nactuality if we\u2019ve added a big miracle. So in fact the nearest\nworlds are ones where a nuclear war occurs, and (3.5) is true.\n\nOne way to see the effects of Lewis\u2019s ordering is to work\nthrough its implication for an important class of cases. When the\nantecedent of a counterfactual is about the occurrence or\nnon-occurrence of a particular event E at time t,\nthe effect of these rules is to say that the nearest worlds are the\nworlds where the following claims all hold, with t* being as\nlate as possible.\n\nThere is an exact match of particular fact with actuality up to\nt*.\nThere is a small, localized law violation at t*.\nThere is exact conformity to the laws of actuality after\nt*.\nThe antecedent is true.\n\n\nSo we find a point just before t where we can make the\nantecedent true by making a small law violation, and let the laws take\nover from there. There is something intuitively plausible about this\nway of viewing counterfactuals; often we do aim to talk about what\nwould have happened if things had gone on in accordance with the laws,\ngiven a starting point slightly different from the one that actually\nobtained.\n\nJonathan Bennett (2003) notes that when the antecedent of a\nconditional is not about a particular event, Lewis\u2019s conditions\nprovide the wrong results. For instance, if the antecedent is of the\nform If one of these events had not happened, then\nLewis\u2019s rules say that the nearest world where the antecedent is\ntrue is always the world where the most recent such event did not\nhappen. But this does not seem to provide intuitively correct truth\nconditions for such conditionals. This need not bother Lewis\u2019s\nlarger project. For one thing, Lewis was not committed to there being\na uniform similarity metric for all counterfactuals. Lewis could say\nthat his default metric was only meant to apply to cases where the\nantecedent was about the happening or non-happening of a particular\nevent at a particular time, and it wouldn\u2019t have seriously\nundermined his larger project. Indeed, as we\u2019ll see in Section\n5.2 below, the counterfactuals he was most interested in, and for\nwhich these criteria of similarity were devised, did have antecedents\nconcerning specific events.\n4. Philosophy of Mind\n\nIn \u201cReduction of Mind\u201d (1994b), David Lewis separates his\ncontributions to philosophy of mind into two broad categories. The\nfirst category is his reductionist metaphysics. From his first\npublished philosophy paper, \u201cAn Argument for the Identity\nTheory\u201d (1966a), Lewis defended a version of the mind-brain\nidentity theory (see the entry on the\n identity theory of mind).\n As he makes clear in \u201cReduction of Mind\u201d, this became an\nimportant part of his global reductionism. We\u2019ll look at his\nmetaphysics of mind in sections 4.1\u20134.3.\n\nThe second category is his theory of mental content. Following Donald\nDavidson in broad outlines, Lewis held that the contents of a\nperson\u2019s mental states are those contents that \u2019fit\u2019\nthe typical causal profile of the state. For example, a state\nisn\u2019t constituted by the combination of a\ndesire for some end plus a belief that waving will bring about that\nend, unless it typically causes waving. In this\nrespect Lewis\u2019s views resembled\n interpretationist\n theories of beliefs. But he differed from other interpretationists in\nseveral ways. We will focus here on two of them. Lewis held that\nmental contents are typically properties, not\npropositions. And he held that a theory of mental content\nrequires an inegalitarian theory of properties. We\u2019ll\nlook at his theory of content in sections 4.4\u20134.6.\n4.1 Ramsey Sentences\n\nThe logical positivists faced a hard dilemma when trying to make sense\nof science. On the one hand, they thought that all meaningful talk was\nultimately talk about observables. On the other hand, they respected\nscience enough to deny that talk of unobservables was meaningless. The\nsolution was to \u2018locate\u2019 the unobservables in the\nobservation language; in other words, to find a way to reduce talk of\nunobservables to talk about observables.\n\nLewis didn\u2019t think much of the broader positivist project, but\nhe was happy to take over some of their technical advances in solving\nthis location problem. Lewis noted that this formal project, the\nproject of trying to define theoretical terms in an already understood\nlanguage, was independent of the particular use we make of it. All\nthat really matters is that we have some terms introduced by a new\ntheory, and that the new theory is introduced in a language that is\ngenerally understood. In any such case it is an interesting question\nwhether we can extract the denotation of an introduced term from the\ntheory used to introduce it.\n\nThe term-introducing theory could be a scientific theory, such as the\ntheory that introduces terms like \u2018electron\u2019, and the\nlanguage of the theory could be observation language. Or, more\ninterestingly, the term-introducing theory could be folk psychology,\nand the language of the theory could be the language of physics. If we\nhave a tool for deriving the denotations of terms introduced by a\ntheory, and we have a way of treating\n folk psychology as a theory\n (i.e., a conjunction of sentences to which folk wisdom is committed),\nwe can derive the denotations of terms like \u2018belief\u2019,\n\u2018pain\u2019, and so on using this theory. Some of Lewis\u2019s\nimportant early work on the metaphysics of mind was concerned with\nsystematising the progress positivists, especially Ramsey and Carnap,\nhad made on just this problem. The procedure is introduced in\n\u201cAn Argument for the Identity Theory\u201d,\n\u201cPsychophysical and Theoretical Identifications\u201d (1972a)\nand \u201cHow to Define Theoretical Terms\u201d (1970c). There are\nimportant later discussions of it in \u201cReduction of Mind\u201d\nand \u201cNaming the Colours\u201d (1997c), among many others.\n\nIn the simplest case, where we have a theory T that introduces one new\nname t, Lewis says that t denotes the x\nsuch that T[x], where T[x] is the sentence we get by\n(a) converting T to a single sentence, perhaps a single long\nconjunction, and (b) replacing all occurrences of t with the\nvariable x. That is, if there is a unique x such\nthat T[x], t denotes it, and t is\ndenotationless otherwise. (Note that it isn\u2019t\nmeaningless, but it is denotationless.)\n\nThe simplest case is not fully general in a few respects. First,\ntheories often introduce many terms simultaneously, not just one. So\nthe theory might introduce new terms t1,\nt2, \u2026, tn. No problem,\nwe can just quantify over n-tuples, where n is the\nnumber of new terms introduced. So instead of looking at\n\u22031x T[x], where \u22031\nmeans \u2018exists a unique\u2019 and x is an individual\nvariable, we look at \u22031x\nT[x], where x is a variable that\nranges over n-tuples, and T[x] is the\nsentence you get by replacing t1 with the first\nmember of x, t2 with the second\nmember of x, \u2026, and tn\nwith the nth member of x.\nAlthough this is philosophically very important, for simplicity\nI\u2019ll focus here on the case where a single theoretical term is\nto be introduced.\n\nThe simplest case is not general in another, more important, respect.\nNot all theoretical terms are names, so it isn\u2019t obvious that we\ncan quantify over them. Lewis\u2019s response, at least in the early\npapers, is to say we can always replace them with names that\namount to the same thing. So if T says that all Fs are\nGs, and we are interested in the term \u2018G\u2019, then\nwe\u2019ll rewrite T so that it now says Gness is a property\nof all Fs. In the early papers, Lewis says that this is a\nharmless restatement of T, but this isn\u2019t correct. Indeed, in\nlater papers such as \u201cVoid and Object\u201d (2004d) and\n\u201cTensing the Copula\u201d (2002a) Lewis notes that some\npredicates don\u2019t correspond to properties or relations. There is\nno property of being non-self-instantiating, for instance, though we\ncan predicate that of many things. In those cases the rewriting will\nnot be possible. But in many cases, we can rewrite T, and then we can\nquantify into it.\n\nThe procedure here is often called Ramsification, or Ramseyfication.\n(Both spellings have occurred in print. The first is in the title of\nBraddon-Mitchell and Nola (1997), the second in the title of Melia and\nSaatsi (2006).) The effect of the procedure is that if we had a theory\nT which was largely expressed in the language O, except for a few\nterms t1, t2, \u2026,\ntn, then we end up with a theory expressed\nentirely in the O-language, but which, says Lewis, has much the same\ncontent. Moreover, if the converted theory is true, then the T-terms\ncan be defined as the substitutends that make the converted sentence\ntrue. This could be used as a way of eliminating theoretical terms\nfrom an observation language, if O is the observation language. Or it\ncould be a way of understanding theoretical terms in terms of natural\nlanguage, if O is the old language we had before the theory was\ndeveloped.\n\nIn cases where there is a unique x such that T[x],\nLewis says that t denotes that x. What if there are\nmany such x? Lewis\u2019s official view in the early papers\nis that in such a case t does not have a denotation. In\n\u201cReduction of Mind\u201d, Lewis retracted this, and said that\nin such a case t is indeterminate between the many values. In\n\u201cNaming the Colours\u201d he partially retracts the retraction,\nand says that t is indeterminate if the different values of\nx are sufficiently similar, and lacks a denotation\notherwise.\n\nA more important complication is the case where there is no realiser\nof the theory. Here it is important to distinguish two cases. First,\nthere is the case where the theory is very nearly realised. That is, a\ntheory that contains enough of the essential features of the original\ntheory turns out to be true. In that case we still want to say that\nthe theory manages to provide denotations for its new terms. Second,\nthere are cases where the theory is a long way from the truth. The\nscientific theory of phlogiston, and the folk theory of witchcraft,\nare examples of this. In this case we want to say that the terms of\nthe theory do not denote.\n\nAs it stands, the formal theory does not have the resources to make\nthis distinction. But this is easy to fix. Just replace the theory T\nwith a theory T*, which is a long disjunction of various important\nconjuncts of T. So if T consisted of three claims,\np1 p2 and\np3, and it is close enough to true if two of them\nare true, then T* would be the disjunction (p1\n\u2227 p2) \u2228 (p1 \u2227\np3) \u2228 (p2 \u2227\np3). Lewis endorses this method in\n\u201cPsychophysical and Theoretical Identifications\u201d The\ndisjuncts are propositions that are true in states that would count as\nclose enough to the world as described by T that T\u2019s terms\ndenote. Note that in a real-world case, some parts of T will be more\nimportant than others, so we won\u2019t be able to just \u2018count\nthe conjuncts\u2019. Still, we should be able to generate a plausible\nT* from T. And the rule in general is that we apply the above strategy\nto T* rather than T to determine the denotation of the terms.\n4.2 Arguing for the Identity Theory\n\nLewis\u2019s first, and most important, use of Ramsification was to\nargue for the mind-brain identity theory, in \u201cAn Argument for\nthe Identity Theory\u201d. Lewis claims in this paper that his\nargument does not rely on parsimony considerations. The orthodox\nargument for the identity theory at the time, as in e.g. J. J. C.\nSmart (1959), turned on parsimony. The identity theory and dualism\nexplain the same data, but the dualist explanation involves more\nontology than the identity theory explanation. So the identity theory\nis preferable. Lewis says that this abductive step is unnecessary. (He\neven evinces concern that it is unsound.) Lewis offers instead an\nargument from the causal efficacy of experience. The argument is\nsomething like the following. (I\u2019ve given the argument that\npains are physical, a similar argument can be given for any other kind\nof experience.)\n\nPains are the kind of thing that typically have such-and-such\nphysical causes and such-and-such physical effects, where the\n\u2018such-and-such\u2019s are filled in by our folk theory of\npain.\nSince the physical is causally closed, the things that have\nsuch-and-such physical causes and such-and-such physical effects are\nthemselves physical.\nSo, pains are physical.\n\n\nThe first premise is analytically true; it follows from the way we\ndefine theoretical terms. The second premise is something we learn\nfrom modern physics. (It isn\u2019t clear, by the way, that we can\navoid Smart\u2019s parsimony argument if we really want to argue for\npremise 2.) So the conclusion is contingent, since modern physics is\ncontingent, but it is well-grounded. Indeed, if we change the second\npremise a little, drawing on neurology rather than physics, we can\ndraw a stronger conclusion, one that Lewis draws in\n\u201cPsychophysical and Theoretical Identifications\u201d.\n\nPains are the kind of thing that typically have such-and-such\nphysical causes and such-and-such physical effects, where the\n\u2018such-and-such\u2019s are filled in by our folk theory of\npain.\nNeural state N is the state that has such-and-such physical causes\nand such-and-such physical effects.\nSo, pains are instances of neural state N.\n\n\nSo, at least in the second argument, Lewis is defending a kind of\nidentity theory. Pains just are instances of neural states. I\u2019ll\nfinish up this survey of Lewis\u2019s metaphysics of mind with a look\nat two complications to this theory.\n4.3 Madmen and Martians\n\nPain is defined by its causal role. Central to that role is that we\nare averse to pain, and try to avoid it. But not all of us do. Some of\nus seek out pain. Call them madmen. A good theory of pain should\naccount for the possibility of madmen.\n\nThe simplest way to account for madmen would be to simply identify\npain with a neural state. So Lewis\u2019s identity theory is\nwell-placed to deal with them. But there is a complication. Not every\ncreature in the universe who is in pain has the same neural states as\nus. It is at least possible that there are creatures in which some\nsilicon state S plays the pain role. That is, the creatures are averse\nto S, they take S to be an indicator of bodily damage, and so on.\nThose creatures are in pain whenever they are in state S. Call any\nsuch creature a Martian. A simple identification of pain with neural\nstate N will stipulate that there couldn\u2019t be any Martians. That\nwould be a bad stipulation to make.\n\nThe possibility of madmen pushes us away from a simple functional\ndefinition of pain. Some creatures have pains that do not play the\npain role. The possibility of Martians pushes us away from a purely\nneural definition of pains. Some creatures have pains that are not\nlike our neural pain states. Indeed, some of them might have pains\nwithout having any neural states at all. Lewis\u2019s way of\nthreading this needle is to say that pains, like all mental states,\nare defined for kinds of creatures. Pains in humans are certain neural\nstates. They are the neural states that (typically, in humans) have\nthe functional role that we associate with pain. In other kinds of\ncreatures pains are other states that (typically, in those creatures)\nplay the pain role. The details of these views are worked out in\n\u201cMad Pain and Martian Pain\u201d (1980c).\n4.4 Constitutive Rationality\n\nThe contents of a mental state are, according to Lewis, the contents\nthat best make sense of the state. As he sometimes puts it, they are\nthe contents that \u2018fit\u2019 the state. Part of what it is to\nfit a state is to rationalise the behavior that the state typically\ncauses. So constraints of rationality, especially concerning what\nactions are rational given that one is in a mental state, are\npartially constitutive of mental content.\n\nPut this broadly, Lewis\u2019s position is indebted to Donald\nDavidson\u2019s work, and Lewis frequently acknowledges the debt. But\nLewis differs from Davidson in several respects. I\u2019ll briefly\nmention four of them here, then look at two substantial changes in the\nnext two sections. (The primary sources for the discussion in this\nsection are \u201cRadical Interpretation\u201d (1974c) and\nespecially its appendices in Philosophical Papers: Volume I\n(1983a), and \u201cReduction of Mind\u201d.)\n\nFirst, Lewis does not think that fit requires that one\u2019s beliefs\nare typically true. Rather, it requires that beliefs are (typically)\nrational. If the subject is surrounded by misleading evidence, false\nbeliefs fit better than true ones.\n\nSecond, Lewis does not give a particularly special place to the\nsubject\u2019s verbal behaviour in considering which content fits. In\nparticular, we don\u2019t first ask what assignment of contents to\ntheir words best makes sense of their verbal behavior, and then say\nthat the central aspect of fit for mental states involves dispositions\nto produce words with the same contents as belief states. Rather,\nLewis follows Grice (among others) in taking mental content to be\nmetaphysically primary, and linguistic content to be determined by\nmental states (see the section on meaning in the entry on\n Grice).\n\nThird, Lewis believes in\n narrow content.\n Indeed, there is a sense in which he thinks narrow content is\nprimary. He holds that\n Swampman\n has contentful states, thereby disagreeing with Davidson (among\nothers). And he thinks that we share many beliefs (most clearly\nmetalinguistic beliefs) with denizens of\n Twin Earth.\n\nFinally, Lewis\u2019s theory of mental content, like his theory of\nmind in general, is anti-individualistic. What matters is the\nfunctional role that a state typically has in creatures of a certain\nkind, not what role it has in this creature. So there might be a\nmadman who does not attempt to get what they desire. A pure\nfunctionalist may say that such a person has no desires, since\ndesires, by definition, are states that agents attempt to satisfy.\nLewis says that as long as this state typically leads to\nsatisfaction-attempts in creatures of this kind, it is a desire.\nIndeed, if a state typically leads to attempts to get X, it\nis a desire for X, even if little about the role the state\nplays in this particular agent would suggest it is a desire for\nX.\n4.5 De Se Content\n\nSome of our beliefs and desires are about specific individuals. I\nmight, for instance, believe that BW is a crook and desire that he be\npunished. Some of our beliefs and desires are self-directed. I might,\nfor instance, believe that I am not a crook and desire that I not be\npunished. If I know that I am BW, then I should not have all of those\nbeliefs and desires. But I might be ignorant of this. In some\ncircumstances (e.g., amnesia, or receiving deceptive information about\nyour identity) it is no sign of irrationality to not know who you are.\nAnd if you don\u2019t know you are X, you may ascribe\ndifferent properties to yourself and to X.\n\nLewis\u2019s way of handling this problem was exceedingly simple. His\noriginal version of interpretationism had it that belief-states were\nultimately probability distributions over possible worlds, and\ndesire-states were ultimately utility functions, again defined over\npossible worlds. In \u201cAttitude De Dicto and De\nSe\u201d (1979b), he argued that this isn\u2019t correct.\nBeliefs and desires are, at the end of the day, probability and\nutility functions. (Or at least they are approximations to those\nfunctions.) But they are not defined over possible worlds. Rather,\nthey are defined over possible individuals.\n\nWhat that means for belief and desire is easiest to express using the\nlanguage of possible worlds. The standard view is that propositions\nare (or at least determine) sets of possible worlds, and that the\ncontent of a belief is a proposition. To believe something then is to\nlocate yourself within a class of possible worlds; to believe that you\ninhabit one of the worlds at which the proposition is true.\nLewis\u2019s view is that properties are (or at least determine) sets\nof possible individuals, and that the content of a belief is a\nproperty. To believe something then is to locate yourself within a\nclass of possible individuals; to believe that you are one of the\nindividuals with the property. More simply, beliefs are the\nself-ascriptions of properties.\n\nWithin this framework, it is easy to resolve the puzzles we addressed\nat the top of the section. If I believe that BW is a crook, I\nself-ascribe the property of inhabiting a world in which BW is a\ncrook. (On Lewis\u2019s theory, beliefs that are not explicitly\nself-locating will be beliefs about which world one is in.) If I\nbelieve I am not a crook, I self-ascribe the property of not being a\ncrook. Since there are possible individuals who are (a) not crooks but\n(b) in worlds where BW is a crook, this is a consistent\nself-ascription. Indeed, I may even have strong evidence that I have\nboth of these properties. So there is no threat of inconsistency, or\neven irrationality here.\n\nLewis\u2019s suggestion about how to think of self-locating mental\nstates has recently been very influential in a variety of areas. Adam\nElga (2001, 2004) has extensively investigated the consequences of\nLewis\u2019s approach for decision theory. Andy Egan (2007) has\ndeveloped a novel form of semantic relativism using Lewis\u2019s\napproach as a model. Daniel Nolan (2007) has recently argued that\nLewis\u2019s approach is less plausible for desire than for belief,\nand Robert Stalnaker (2008) argues that the view makes the wrong\njudgments about sameness and difference of belief across agents and\ntimes.\n4.6 Natural Properties\n\nOne classic problem for interpretationism is that our dispositions\nmassively underdetermine contents. I believe that (healthy) grass is\ngreen. But for some interpretations of\n \u2018grue\u2019,\n ascribing to me the belief that grass is grue will fit my\ndispositions just as well. As Lewis points out towards the end of\n\u201cNew Work For a Theory of Universals\u201d (1983e), if we are\nallowed to change the interpretations of my beliefs and desires at the\nsame time, the fit can be made even better. This looks like a problem\nfor interpretationism.\n\nThe problem is of course quite familiar. In different guises it is\n Goodman\u2019s grue/green problem,\n Kripkenstein\u2019s plus/quus problem, Quine\u2019s\n gavagai\n problem, and\n Putnam\u2019s puzzle\n of the brain in a vat with true beliefs (Goodman 1955, Wittgenstein\n1953, Kripke 1982, Quine 1960, Putnam 1981). One way or another it has\nto be solved.\n\nLewis\u2019s solution turns on a metaphysical posit. Some properties,\nhe says, are more natural than others. The natural properties\nare those that, to use an ancient phrase, carve nature at the joints.\nThey make for objective resemblance amongst the objects that have\nthem, and objective dissimilarity between things that have them and\nthose that lack them. The natural properties, but not in general the\nunnatural properties, are relevant to the causal powers of things.\nAlthough science is in the business of discovering which natural\nproperties are instantiated, when Lewis talks about natural properties\nhe doesn\u2019t mean properties given a special role by nature. It is\nnot a contingent matter which properties are natural, because it\nisn\u2019t a contingent matter which properties make for objective\nsimilarity.\n\nSome properties are perfectly natural. Other properties are less\nnatural, but not all unnatural properties are alike. Green things are\na diverse and heterogeneous bunch, but they are more alike than the\ngrue things are. And the grue things are more alike than some other\neven more disjunctive bunches. So as well as positing perfectly\nnatural properties, Lewis posits a relation of more and less natural\non properties. He suggests that we just need to take the perfectly\nnatural as primitive, and we can define the naturalness of other\nproperties in terms of it. The idea is that the naturalness of a\nproperty is a function of the complexity of that property\u2019s\ndefinition in terms of perfectly natural properties. It isn\u2019t at\nall obvious that this suggestion will capture the intuitive idea, and\nLewis does not defend it at any length.\n\nNatural properties will play a major role for Lewis. We\u2019ve\nalready seen one place where it turns out they are needed; namely, in\nsaying what it is for two worlds to have an \u2018exact match\u2019\nof spatiotemporal regions. What Lewis means by that is that the\nregions are intrinsic duplicates. And the way he analyses intrinsic\nduplication in (1983e) is that two things are duplicates if they have\nthe same intrinsic properties. We will see many other uses of natural\nproperties as we go along, particularly in the discussion of Humean\nsupervenience in section 5.\n\nBut as Lewis (1983e) makes clear, natural properties play many more\nroles in his larger philosophy, including in the theory of\nrationality, the theory of mental content, the theory of linguistic\ncontent, and the theory of laws. It is rational to have a belief with\na more natural rather than a less natural content. If two different\nassignments of beliefs and desires would make equally good sense of an\nagent\u2019s dispositions, the more natural assignment is the correct\none. If two different interpretations of the words of a public\nlanguage would make equally good sense of speakers\u2019 practices,\nthe more natural interpretation is the correct one. And laws are\nsimple generalisations, where simplicity is defined in part in terms\nof naturalness.\n\nThere is some scholarly dispute about the relationship between the\nfour theses set out in the last four sentences of the preceding\nparagraph. Williams (2007) argues that the thesis about laws is\nexplanatorily prior to some of the theses about rationality and\ncontent. Sider (2001) argues that the third thesis is a standalone\npart of Lewis\u2019s theory. Schwarz (2014), however, argues that it\nisn\u2019t even a part of Lewis\u2019s theory. Weatherson (2003)\nendorses Sider\u2019s view, but later Weatherson (2013) endorses\nSchwarz\u2019s critique of Sider\u2019s interpretation, while\narguing that a qualified version of the third thesis can nevertheless\nbe derived from the first two. (A version of Schwarz\u2019s paper had\nbeen in circulation since 2006, so it well precedes Weatherson\u2019s\n2013 paper, despite the slightly later publication date.)\nJanssen-Lauret and MacBride (2020) respond to Schwarz, arguing that\nevidence from Lewis\u2019s recently available correspondence supports\nthe view that Lewis took naturalness to play a central role in\ndetermining the reference of individual words.\n\nThis topic, natural properties, was one of very few topics where Lewis\nhad a serious change of view over the course of his career. Of course,\nLewis changed the details of many of his views, in response to\ncriticism and further thought. But the idea that some properties could\nbe natural, could make for objective similarity, in ways that most\nsets of possibilia do not, is notably absent from his writings before\n\u201cNew Work\u201d. Indeed, as late as \u201cIndividuation by\nAcquaintance and by Stipulation\u201d (1983c), he was rather\ndismissive of the idea. But natural properties came to play central\nroles in his metaphysics and, as we see here, his theory of mind. As\nLewis notes in \u201cNew Work\u201d, much of the impetus for his\nchange of view came from discussions with D. M. Armstrong, and from\nthe arguments in favour of universals that Armstrong presented in his\n(1978).\n5. Humean Supervenience\n\nMany of David Lewis\u2019s papers in metaphysics were devoted to\nsetting out, and defending, a doctrine he called \u201cHumean\nSupervenience\u201d. Here is Lewis\u2019s succinct statement of the\nview.\n\nIt is the doctrine that all there is to the world is a vast mosaic of\nlocal matters of particular fact, just one little thing and then\nanother. (Lewis 1986b: ix)\n\n\nThe doctrine can be factored into two distinct theses. The first is\nthe thesis that, in John Bigelow\u2019s words, \u201ctruth\nsupervenes on being\u201d. That is, all the truths about a world\n supervene\n on the distribution of perfectly natural properties and relations in\nthat world. The second is the thesis that the perfectly natural\nproperties and relations in this world are\n intrinsic properties\n of point-sized objects, and spatiotemporal relations. Lewis held that\nthe first of these was necessary and a priori. (See, for instance,\n\u201cParts of Classes\u201d (1991a), \u201cReduction of\nMind\u201d, \u201cTruthmaking and Difference-making\u201d (2001d).)\nThe second is contingently true if true at all. Indeed, modern physics\nsuggests that it is not true (Maudlin 2007: Ch. 2). Lewis was aware of\nthis. His aim in defending Humean supervenience was to defend, as he\nput it, its \u201ctenability\u201d (1986a: xi). We will return at\nthe end of this section to the question of why he might have wanted to\ndo this. For now, we will focus on how he went about this project.\n\nThe primary challenge to Humean supervenience comes from those who\nhold that providing a subvenient basis for all the truths of this\nworld requires more than intrinsic properties of point-sized objects\nand spatiotemporal relations. Some of these challenges come from\ntheorists who think best physics will need non-spatiotemporal\nrelations in order to explain\n Bell\u2019s Theorem.\n But more commonly it comes from those who think that grounding the\nmodal, the nomic or the mental requires adding properties and\nrelations to any Humean mosaic constructed from properties found in\nfundamental physics. (I\u2019m using \u2018mental\u2019 here to\ncover all the properties that Lewis considered mental, broadly\nconstrued. This includes contents, since Lewis thought content was\ngrounded in mental content, and value, since he thought values were\ngrounded in idealised desires. So it\u2019s a fairly broad category,\nand there is a lot that isn\u2019t obviously reducible to fundamental\nphysics. As we\u2019ll see, Lewis attempts to reduce it all\nstep-by-step.)\n\nWe\u2019ve discussed in the previous section how Lewis aimed to\nreduce the mental to the nomic. (Or at least much of it; we\u2019ll\nreturn to the question of value in section 7.5.) We\u2019ll discuss\nin the next section his distinctive modal metaphysics. In this section\nwe\u2019ll look at how he attempted to locate the nomic in the Humean\nmosaic. Lewis\u2019s aim was to show that nomic properties and\nrelations could be located in the Humean mosaic by locating them as\nprecisely and as explicitly as he could. So the location project\nrevealed a lot about these nomic features. We\u2019ll spend the next\ntwo subsections looking at the two important parts of this project.\nNotably, they are two parts where Lewis refined his views several\ntimes on the details of the location.\n5.1 Laws and Chances\n\nLewis\u2019s reductionist project starts with\n laws of nature.\n Building on some scattered remarks by Ramsey and Mill, Lewis proposed\na version of the \u2018best-system\u2019 theory of laws of nature.\nThere is no paper devoted to this view, but it is discussed in section\n3.3 of Counterfactuals, in \u201cNew Work For a Theory of\nUniversals\u201d, extensively in Postscript C to the reprint of\n\u201cA Subjectivist\u2019s Guide to Objective Chance\u201d in\n(1986b), and in \u201cHumean Supervenience Debugged\u201d\n(1994a).\n\nThe simple version of the theory is that the laws are the winners of a\n\u2018competition\u2019 among all collections of truths. Some truths\nare simple, e.g. the truth that this table is brown. Some truths are\nstrong; they tell us a lot about the world. For example, the\nconjunction of every truth in this Encyclopedia rules out a large\nchunk of modal space. Typically, these are exclusive categories;\nsimple truths are not strong, and strong truths are not simple. But\nthere are some exceptions. The truth that any two objects are\nattracted to one another, with a force proportional to the product of\ntheir masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them,\nis relatively simple, but also quite strong in that it tells us a lot\nabout the forces between many distinct objects. The laws, says Lewis,\nare these simple but strong truths.\n\nTwo qualifications are needed before we get to Lewis\u2019s 1973 view\nof laws. It is collections of truths, not individual truths, that are\nmeasured and compared for simplicity and strength. And it is not every\ntruth in the winning collection (or best system), but only the\ngeneralisations within it, that are laws. So even if the best system\nincludes particular facts about the Big Bang or its immediate\naftermath, e.g. that the early universe was a low entropy state, those\nfacts are not laws on Lewis\u2019s view.\n\nIn \u201cNew Work For a Theory of Universals\u201d, Lewis notes\nanother restriction that is needed. If we measure the simplicity of\nsome truths by the length of their statement in an arbitrarily chosen\nlanguage, then any truth at all can be made simple. Let Fx be\ntrue if and only if x is in a world where every truth in this\nEncyclopedia is true. Then Everything is F is simply\nstateable in a language containing F, and is presumably\nstrong. So Everything is F will be a law. But this kind of\nconstruction would clearly trivialise the theory of laws.\nLewis\u2019s solution is to say that we measure the simplicity of a\nclaim by how easily stateable it is in a language where all predicates\ndenote perfectly natural properties. He notes that this move\nrequires that the natural properties are specified prior to specifying\nthe laws, which means that we can\u2019t reductively specify\nnaturalness in terms of laws. (In any case, since Lewis holds that\nlaws are contingent (1986a: 91) but which properties are natural is\nnot contingent (1986a: 60n), this approach would not be open to\nLewis.)\n\nIn \u201cHumean Supervenience Debugged\u201d, Lewis notes how to\nextend this theory to indeterministic worlds. Some laws don\u2019t\nsay what will happen, but what will have a chance of happening. If the\nchances of events could be determined antecedently to the laws being\ndetermined, we could let facts about chances be treated more or less\nlike any other fact for the purposes of our \u2018competition\u2019.\nBut, as we\u2019ll see, Lewis doesn\u2019t think the prospects for\ndoing this are very promising. So instead he aims to reduce laws and\nchances simultaneously to distributions of properties.\n\nInstead of ranking collections of truths by two measures, strength and\nsimplicity, we will rank them by three, strength, simplicity and fit.\nA collection of truths that entails that what does happen has (at\nearlier times) a higher chance of happening has better fit than a\ncollection that entails that what happens had a lower chance of\nhappening. The laws are those generalisations in the collection of\ntruths that do the best by these three measures of strength,\nsimplicity and fit. The collection will entail various\n\u2018history-to-chance\u2019 conditionals. These are conditionals\nof the form If Ht then Pt(A) = x, where\nHt is a proposition about the history of the world\nto t, and Pt is the function from\npropositions to their chance at t. The chance of A\nat t in w is x if and only if there is some\nsuch conditional If Ht then Pt(A) = x,\nwhere Ht is the history of w to\nt.\n\nThe position that I\u2019ve sketched here is the position that Lewis\nsays that he originally was drawn towards in 1975, and that he\nendorsed in print in 1994. (The dates are from his own description of\nthe evolution of his views in (1994a).) But in between, in both\n(1980a) and Postscript C to its reprinting in (1986b), he rejected\nthis position because he thought it conflicted with a non-negotiable\nconceptual truth about chance. This truth was what he called the\n\u201cPrincipal Principle\u201d.\n\nThe Principal Principle says that a rational agent conforms their\ncredences to the chances. More precisely, it says the following is\ntrue. Assume we have a number x, proposition A, time\nt, rational agent whose evidence is entirely about times up\nto and including t, and a proposition E that (a) is\nabout times up to and including t and (b) entails that the\nchance of A at t is x. In any such case,\nthe agent\u2019s credence in A given E is\nx.\n\nAn agent who knows what happens after t need not be guided by\nchances at t. If I\u2019ve seen the coin land heads, that\nits chance of landing heads was 0.5 at some earlier time is no reason\nto have my credence in heads be 0.5. Conversely, if all I know is that\nthe chance is 0.5, that\u2019s no reason for my conditional credence\nin heads to be 0.5 conditional on anything at all. Conditional on it\nlanding heads, my credence in heads is 1, for instance. But given\nthese two restrictions, the Principal Principle seems like a good\nconstraint. Lewis calls evidence about times after t\n\u2018inadmissible\u2019, which lets us give a slightly more concise\nsummary of what the Principal Principle says. For agents with no\ninadmissible evidence, the rational credence in A,\nconditional on the chance of A being x, combined\nwith any admissible evidence, is x.\n\nThe problem Lewis faced in the 1980s papers is that the best systems\naccount of chance makes the Principal Principle either useless or\nfalse. Here is a somewhat stylised example. (I make no claims about\nthe physical plausibility of this setup; more plausible examples would\nbe more complicated, but would make much the same point.) Let\nt be some time before any particle has decayed. Let\nA be the proposition that every radioactive particle will\ndecay before it reaches its actual half-life. At t,\nA has a positive chance of occurring. Indeed, its chance is 1\nin 2n, where n is the number of\nradioactive particles in the world. (Assume, again for the sake of our\nstylised example, that n is finite.) But if A\noccurred, the best system of the world would be different from how it\nactually is. It would improve fit, for instance, to say that the\nchance of decay within the actual half-life would be 1. So someone who\nknows that the chance of A is 1 in 2n\nknows that A won\u2019t happen.\n\nLewis called A an \u2018undermining\u2019 future; it has a\nchance of happening, but if it happens the chances are different. The\nproblem with underminers is that they conflict with the Principal\nPrinciple. Someone who knows the chance of A should, by the\nPrincipal Principle, have credence 1 in 2n that\nA will happen. But given the chance of A, it is\npossible to deduce ~A, and hence have credence in A.\nThis looks like an inconsistency, so like any principle that implies a\ncontradiction, the Principal Principle must be false. The most obvious\nway out is to say that information about the chance of A is\ninadmissible, since it reveals something about the future, namely that\nA doesn\u2019t occur. But to say that chances are\ninadmissible is to make the Principal Principle useless. So given the\nbest systems theory of laws and chances, the Principal Principle is\neither false or useless. Since the Principal Principle is neither\nfalse nor useless, Lewis concluded in these 1980s papers that the best\nsystems theory of laws and chances was false.\n\nThe problem with this was that it wasn\u2019t clear what could\nreplace the best systems theory. Lewis floated two approaches in the\npostscripts to the reprinting of (1980a), one based on primitive\nchances, and the other based on history-to-chance conditionals being\nnecessary. But neither seemed metaphysically plausible, and although\neach was consistent with the Principal Principle, they made it either\nmysterious (in the first case) or implausible (in the second). A\nbetter response, as set out in \u201cHumean Supervenience\nDebugged\u201d, was to qualify the Principal Principle. Lewis said\nthat what was really true was the \u201cNew Principle\u201d. His\nproposal was based on ideas developed by Ned Hall (1994) and Michael\nThau (1994).\n\nWe\u2019ll explain the New Principle by starting with a special case\nof the old Principle. Let T be the \u2018theory of\nchance\u2019 for the world, the conjunction of all history-to-chance\nconditionals. And let H be the history of the world to\nt. Assuming T is admissible, the old Principal\nPrinciple says that the credence in A given H \u2227\nT should be the chance of A at t. The New\nPrinciple says that the credence in A given H \u2227\nT should be the chance of A given T at\nt. That is, where C is the agent\u2019s credence\nfunction, and P is the chance function, and the agent has no\ninadmissible evidence, it should be that C(A |\nH \u2227 T) = P(A | T).\nThis compares to the old principle, which held that\nC(A | H \u2227 T) =\nP(A).\n\nThat\u2019s the special case of the New Principle for an agent with\nno inadmissible evidence. The general case follows from this special\ncase. In general, assuming the agent has no inadmissible evidence, the\nrational credence in A given E is the expected\nvalue, given E, of the chance of A given H\n\u2227 T. That is, where C is the agent\u2019s\ncredence function, and P is the chance function, it should be\nthe sum across all possible combinations of H and T\nof C(H \u2227 T |\nE)P(A | H \u2227 T).\n\nThe New Principle is, Lewis argues, consistent with the best systems\ntheory of laws and chances. Lewis had originally thought that any\nspecification of chance had to be consistent with the Principal\nPrinciple. But in later works he argued that the New Principle was a\nclose enough approximation to the Principal Principle that a theory of\nchances consistent with it was close enough to our pre-theoretic\nnotion of chance to deserve the name. So he could, and did, happily\nendorse the best systems theory of laws and chance.\n5.2 Causation\n\nIn \u201cCausation\u201d (1973b), Lewis put forward an analysis of\n causation in terms of counterfactual dependence.\n The idea was that event B was counterfactually dependent on\nevent A if and only if the counterfactual Had A not\noccurred, B would not have occurred was true. Then event\nC causes event E if and only if there is a chain\nC, D1, \u2026, Dn,\nE such that each member in the chain (except C) is\ncounterfactually dependent on the event before it. In summary,\ncausation is the ancestral of counterfactual dependence.\n\nThe reasoning about chains helped Lewis sidestep a problem that many\nthought unavoidable for a counterfactual theory of causation, namely\nthe problem of pre-empting causes. Imagine that Suzy throws a rock,\nthe rock hits a window and the window shatters. Suzy\u2019s throw\ncaused the window to shatter. But there is a backup\nthrower\u2014Billy. Had Suzy not thrown, Billy would have thrown\nanother rock and broken the window. So the window breaking is not\ncounterfactually dependent on Suzy\u2019s throw. Lewis\u2019s\nsolution was to posit an event of the rock flying towards the window.\nHad Suzy not thrown, the rock would not have been flying towards the\nwindow. And had the rock not been flying towards the window, the\nwindow would have not shattered. Lewis\u2019s thought here is that it\nis Suzy\u2019s throwing that causes Billy to not throw; once she has\nthrown Billy is out of the picture and the window\u2019s shattering\ndepends only on what Suzy\u2019s rock does. So we avoid this problem\nof pre-empters.\n\nMuch of the argumentation in \u201cCausation\u201d concerns the\nsuperiority of the counterfactual analysis to deductive-nomological\ntheories. These arguments were so successful that from a contemporary\nperspective they seem somewhat quaint. There are so few supporters of\ndeductive-nomological theories in contemporary metaphysics that a\nmodern paper would not spend nearly so much time on them.\n\nAfter \u201cCausation\u201d the focus, at least of those interested\nin reductive theories, moved to counterfactual theories. And it became\nclear that Lewis had a bit of work left to do. He needed to say more\nabout the details of the notion of counterfactual dependence. He did\nthis in \u201cCounterfactual Dependence and Time\u2019s Arrow\u201d\n(1979c), as discussed in section 2. He needed to say more about the\nnature of events. In \u201cEvents\u201d (1986g) he said that they\nwere natural properties of regions of space-time. (At this stage he\nassumed that events were the relata of the causal relation. This\nassumption is criticised by L. A. Paul (2000), and in (2004d) Lewis\ndrops it.) And prodded by Jaegwon Kim (1973), he needed to add that\nA and B had to be wholly distinct events for\nB to counterfactually depend on A. The alternative\nwould be to say that an event\u2019s happening is caused by any\nessential part of the event, which is absurd.\n\nBut the biggest problem concerned what became known as \u201clate\npre-emption\u201d. In the rock throwing example above, we assumed\nthat Billy decided not to throw when he saw Suzy throwing. But we can\nimagine a variant of the case where Billy waits to see whether\nSuzy\u2019s rock hits, and only then decides not to throw. In such a\ncase, it is the window\u2019s shattering, not anything prior to this,\nthat causes Billy not to throw. That means that there is no event\nbetween Suzy\u2019s throw and the window\u2019s shattering on which\nthe shattering is counterfactually dependent.\n\nLewis addressed this issue in \u201cRedundant Causation\u201d, one\nof the six postscripts to the reprinting of \u201cCausation\u201d in\n(1986b). He started by introducing a new concept: quasi-dependence.\nB quasi-depends on A if and only if there is a\nprocess starting with A*, and ending with B* , and\nB* counterfactually depends on A*, and the process\nfrom A* to B* is an intrinsic duplicate of the\nprocess from A to B, and the laws governing the process from\nA* to B* (i.e. the laws of the world in which\nA* and B* happen) are the same as the laws governing\nthe process from A to B. In short, quasi-dependence\nis the relation you get if you start with dependence, then add all of\nthe duplicates of dependent processes. Causation is then the ancestral\nof quasi-dependence. Although the window\u2019s shattering does not\ndepend on Suzy\u2019s throw, it does quasi-depend on it. That\u2019s\nbecause there is a world, with the same laws, with a duplicate of\nSuzy\u2019s throw, but Billy determined not to throw, and in that\nworld the window shatters in just the same way, and depends on\nSuzy\u2019s throw.\n\nEventually, Lewis became unsatisfied with the quasi-dependence based\ntheory. In \u201cCausation as Influence\u201d (2000a, 2004a) he set\nout several reasons for being unhappy with it, and a new theory to\nsupersede it.\n\nOne argument against it is that it makes causation intrinsic to the\npair C and E, but some cases, especially cases of\ndouble prevention, show that causation is extrinsic. Double\nprevention occurs when an event, call it C, prevents\nsomething that would have prevented E from happening.\nIntuitively, these are cases of causation. Indeed, when we look at the\ndetails we find that many everyday cases of causation have this\npattern. But that C causes E does not depend on the\nintrinsic natures of C and E. Rather, it depends on\nthere being some threat to E, a threat that C\nprevents, and the existence of threats is typically extrinsic to\nevents.\n\nAnother argument is that quasi-dependence cannot account for what came\nto be known as \u2018trumping pre-emption\u2019. Lewis illustrated\nthis idea with an example from Jonathan Schaffer (2000). The troops\nare disposed to obey all orders from either the Sergeant or the Major.\nBut they give priority to the Major\u2019s orders, due to the\nMajor\u2019s higher rank. Both the Major and the Sergeant order the\ntroops to advance, and they do advance. Intuitively, it is the Major,\nnot the Sergeant, who caused the advance, since the Major\u2019s\norders have priority. But the advance does quasi-depend on the\nSergeant\u2019s orders, since in a world where the Major\ndoesn\u2019t make an order, the advance does depend on the\nSergeant.\n\nLewis\u2019s alternative theory relied on changing the definition of\ncounterfactual dependence. The theory in \u201cCausation\u201d was\nbased on what he came to call \u2018whether-whether\u2019\ndependence. What\u2019s crucial is that whether B\nhappens depends counterfactually on whether A\nhappens. The new theory was based on what we might call\n\u2018how-how\u2019 dependence. Lewis says that B depends\non A if there are large families of counterfactuals of the\nform If A had happened in this way, then B would\nhave happened in that way, and the ways in which B would\nhappen are systematically dependent on the ways in which A\nhappens. How much A influences B depends on how big\nthis family is, how much variation there is in the way B\nchanges, and how systematic the influence of A on B\nis. He then defines causation as the ancestral of this notion of\ncounterfactual dependence.\n\nOn this new theory, causation is a degree concept, rather than an\n\u2018all-or-nothing\u2019 concept, since counterfactual dependence\ncomes in degrees. Sometimes Lewis says we properly ignore small\namounts of causation. For instance, the location of nearby parked cars\ninfluences the smashing of a window by a rock in virtue of small\ngravitational effects of the cars on the flight of the rock. But\nit\u2019s very little influence, and we properly ignore it most of\nthe time.\n\nThere are two other notable features of \u201cCausation as\nInfluence\u201d. It contains Lewis\u2019s most comprehensive defence\nof the transitivity of causation. This principle was central to\nLewis\u2019s theory of causation from the earliest days, but had come\nunder sustained attack over the years. And the paper has a brief\nattack on non-Humean theories that take causation to be a primitive.\nLewis says that these theories can\u2019t explain the variety of\ncausal relations that we perceive and can think about. These passages\nmark an interesting change in what Lewis took to be the primary\nalternatives to his counterfactuals based reductionism. In 1973 the\nopponents were other kinds of reductionists; in 2000 they were the\nnon-reductionists.\n5.3 Why Humean Supervenience\n\nGiven these concepts, a number of other concepts fall into place.\n Dispositions\n are reduced to counterfactual dependencies, though as is made clear\nin \u201cFinkish Dispositions\u201d (1997b), the reduction is not as\nsimple as it might have seemed. Perception is reduced to dispositions\nand causes. (See, for instance, \u201cVeridical Hallucination and\nProsthetic Vision\u201d (1980d).) We discussed the reduction of\nmental content to dispositions and causes in section 4. And we\ndiscussed the reduction of linguistic content to mental content in\nsection 1. Values are reduced to mental states in \u201cDispositional\nTheories of Value\u201d (1989b).\n\nBut we might worry about the very foundation of the project. We\nstarted with the assumption that our subvenient base consists of\nintrinsic properties of point-sized objects and spatiotemporal\nrelations. But Bell\u2019s inequality suggests that modern physics\nrequires, as primitive, other relations between objects. (Or it\nrequires intrinsic properties of dispersed objects.) So Humean\nsupervenience fails in this world.\n\nLewis\u2019s response is somewhat disarming. Writing in 1986, part of\nhis response is scepticism about the state of quantum mechanics.\n(There is notably less scepticism in \u201cHow Many Lives Has\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cat\u201d (2004b).) But the larger part of\nhis response is to suggest that scientific challenges to Humean\nsupervenience are outside his responsibility.\n\nReally, what I uphold is not so much the truth of Humean supervenience\nas the tenability of it. If physics itself were to teach me\nthat it is false, I wouldn\u2019t grieve ... What I want to fight are\nphilosophical arguments against Humean supervenience. When\nphilosophers claim that one or another common-place feature of the\nworld cannot supervene on the arrangement of qualities, I make it my\nbusiness to resist. Being a commonsensical fellow (except where\nunactualized possible worlds are concerned) I will seldom deny that\nthe features in question exist. I grant their existence, and do my\nbest to show how they can, after all, supervene on the arrangement of\nqualities. (1986b: xi)\n\n\nWe might wonder why Lewis found this such an interesting\nproject. If physics teaches that Humean supervenience is false, why\ncare whether there are also philosophical objections to it? There are\ntwo (related) reasons why we might care.\n\nRecall that we said that Humean supervenience is a conjunction of\nseveral theses. One of these is a thesis about which perfectly natural\nproperties are instantiated in this world, namely local ones. That\nthesis is threatened by modern physics. But the rest of the package,\narguably, is not. In particular, the thesis that all facts supervene\non the distribution of perfectly natural properties and relations does\nnot appear to be threatened. (Though see Maudlin (2007: Ch. 2) for a\ndissenting view.) Nor is the thesis that perfectly natural properties\nand relations satisfy a principle of recombination threatened by\nmodern physics. The rough idea of the principle of recombination is\nthat any distribution of perfectly natural properties is possible.\nThis thesis is Lewis\u2019s version of the Humean principle that\nthere are no necessary connections between distinct existences, and\nLewis is determined to preserve as strong a version of it as he\ncan.\n\nAlthough physics does not seem to challenge these two theses, several\nphilosophers do challenge them on distinctively philosophical grounds.\nSome of them suggest that the nomic, the intensional, or the normative\ndo not supervene on the distribution of perfectly natural properties.\nOthers suggest that the nomic,\n intentional,\n or normative properties are perfectly natural, and as a consequence\nperfectly natural properties are not freely recombinable. The\nphilosophical arguments in favour of such positions rarely turn on the\nprecise constitution of the Humean\u2019s preferred subvenient base.\nIf Lewis can show that such arguments fail in the setting of classical\nphysics, then he\u2019ll have refuted all of the arguments against\nHumean superveience that don\u2019t rely on the details of modern\nphysics. In practice that means he\u2019ll have refuted many, though\nnot quite all, of the objections to Humean supervenience.\n\nA broader reason for Lewis to care about Humean supervenience comes\nfrom looking at his overall approach to metaphysics. When faced with\nsomething metaphysically problematic, say\n free will,\n there are three broad approaches. Some philosophers will argue that\nfree will can\u2019t be located in a scientific world-view, so it\nshould be eliminated. Call these \u2018the eliminativists\u2019.\nSome philosophers will agree that free will can\u2019t be located in\nthe scientific world-view, so that\u2019s a reason to expand our\nmetaphysical picture to include free will, perhaps as a new primitive.\nCall these \u2018the expansionists\u2019. And some philosophers will\nreject the common assumption of an incompatibility. Instead they will\nargue that we can have free will without believing in anything that\nisn\u2019t in the scientific picture. Call these \u2018the\ncompatibilists\u2019.\n\nAs the above quote makes clear, Lewis was a compatibilist about most\nquestions in metaphysics. He certainly was one about free will.\n(\u201cAre We Free to Break the Laws?\u201d (1981a).) And he was a\ncompatibilist about most nomic, intentional and normative concepts.\nThis wasn\u2019t because he had a global argument for compatibilism.\nIndeed, he was an eliminativist about religion (\u201cAnselm and\nActuality\u201d (1970a), \u201cDivine Evil\u201d (2007)). And in\nsome sense he was an expansionist about modality. Lewis may have\ncontested this; he thought introducing more worlds did not increase\nthe number of kinds of things in our ontology, because we are already\ncommitted to there being at least one world. As Melia (1992: 192)\npoints out though, the inhabitants of those worlds include all kinds\nof things not found in, or reducible to, fundamental physics. They\ninclude spirits, gods, trolls and every other consistent beast\nimaginable. So at least when it came to what there is, as opposed to\nwhat there actually is, Lewis\u2019s ontology was rather\nexpansionist.\n\nFor all that, Lewis\u2019s default attitude was to accept that much\nof our common-sense thinking about the nomic, the intentional and the\nnormative was correct, and that this was perfectly compatible with\nthis world containing nothing more than is found in science, indeed\nthan is found in fundamental physics.\n\nCompatibilists should solve what Frank Jackson calls \u2018the\nlocation problem\u2019 (Jackson 1998). If you think that there are,\nsay, beliefs, and you think that having beliefs in one\u2019s\nmetaphysics doesn\u2019t commit you to having anything in your\nontology beyond fundamental physics, then you should, as Jackson puts\nit, be able to locate beliefs in the world described by\nfundamental physics. More generally, for whatever you accept, you\nshould be able to locate it in the picture of the world you\naccept.\n\nThis was certainly the methodology that Lewis accepted. And since he\nthought that so much of our common sense worldview was compatible with\nfundamental physics, he had many versions of the location problem to\nsolve. One way to go about this would be to find exactly what the\ncorrect scientific theory is, and locate all the relevant properties\nin that picture. But this method has some shortcomings. For one thing,\nit might mean having to throw out your metaphysical work whenever the\nscientific theories change. For another, it means having your\nmetaphysics caught up in debates about the best scientific theories,\nand about their interpretation. So Lewis took a somewhat different\napproach.\n\nWhat Lewis\u2019s defence of Humean supervenience gives us is a\nrecipe for locating the nomic, intentional and normative properties in\na physical world. And it is a recipe that uses remarkably few\ningredients; just intrinsic properties of point-sized objects, and\nspatio-temporal relations. It is likely that ideal physics will have\nmore in it than that. For instance, it might have entanglement\nrelations, as are needed to explain Bell\u2019s inequality. But it is\nunlikely to have less. And the more there is in fundamental physics,\nthe easier it is to solve the location problem, because the\nwould-be locator has more resources to work with.\n\nThe upshot of all this is that a philosophical defence of Humean\nsupervenience, especially a defence like Lewis\u2019s that shows us\nexplicitly how to locate various folk properties in classical physics,\nis likely to show us how to locate those properties in more up-to-date\nphysics. So Lewis\u2019s defence of Humean supervenience then\ngeneralises into a defence of the compatibility of large swathes of\nfolk theory with ideal physics. And the defence is consistent with the\nrealist principle that truth supervenes on being, and with the Humean\ndenial of necessary connections between distinct existences. And that,\nquite clearly, is a philosophically interesting project.\n6. Modal Realism\n\nThis entry has been stressing Lewis\u2019s many and diverse\ncontributions to philosophy. But there is one thesis with which he is\nassociated above all others: modal realism. Lewis held that this world\nwas just one among many like it. A proposition, p is possibly\ntrue if and only if p is true in one of these worlds.\nRelatedly, he held that individuals like you or I (or this computer)\nonly exist in one possible world. So what it is for a proposition like\nYou are happy to be true in another world is not for you to\nbe happy in that world; you aren\u2019t in that world. Rather, it is\nfor your counterpart to be happy in that world.\n\nLewis wrote about modal realism in many places. As early as\nCounterfactuals he wrote this famous passage.\n\nI believe, and so do you, that things could have been different in\ncountless ways. But what does this mean? Ordinary language permits the\nparaphrase: there are many ways things could have been besides the way\nthey actually are. I believe that things could have been different in\ncountless ways; I believe permissible paraphrases of what I believe;\ntaking the paraphrase at its face value, I therefore believe in the\nexistence of entities that might be called \u2018ways things could\nhave been.\u2019 I prefer to call them \u2018possible worlds.\u2019\n(1973a: 84)\n\n\nAnd Lewis used counterpart theory throughout his career to resolve\nmetaphysical puzzles in fields stretching from\n personal identity\n (\u201cCounterparts of Persons and Their Bodies\u201d (1971c)) to\n truthmaker theory\n (\u201cThings qua Truthmakers\u201d (2003b)). Indeed, Lewis\u2019s\noriginal statement of counterpart theory is in one of his first\npublished metaphysics papers (\u201cCounterpart Theory and Quantified\nModal Logic\u201d (1968)).\n\nBut the canonical statement and defence of both modal realism and\ncounterpart theory is in On the Plurality of Worlds (1986a),\nthe book that grew out of his 1984 John Locke lectures. This section\nwill follow the structure of that book.\n\nThe little \u2018argument by paraphrase\u2019 from\nCounterfactuals is a long way from an argument for\nLewis\u2019s form of modal realism. For one thing, the argument\nrelies on taking a folksy paraphrase as metaphysically revealing;\nperhaps we would be better off treating this as just a careless manner\nof speaking. For another, the folksy paraphrase Lewis uses isn\u2019t\nobviously innocuous; like many other abstraction principles it could\nbe hiding a contradiction. And the argument does little to show that\nother possible worlds are concreta; talking of them as ways things\ncould be makes them sound like properties, which are arguably\nabstracta if they exist at all. The first three chapters of\nPlurality address these three issues. The fourth chapter is\nan extended discussion of the place of individuals in modal realism.\nWe\u2019ll look at these chapters in order.\n6.1 A Philosophers\u2019 Paradise\n\nThe short argument from Counterfactuals that I quoted seems\ndeeply unQuinean. Rather than saying that possible worlds exist\nbecause they are quantified over in the best paraphrase of our\ntheories, Lewis says they exist because they are quantified over in\njust one\n paraphrase\n of our theories. To be sure, he says this is a permissible\nparaphrase. On the other hand, there is vanishingly little defence of\nits permissibility.\n\nIn the first chapter of Plurality Lewis takes a much more\northodox Quinean line. He argues, at great length, that the best\nversion of many philosophical theories requires quantification over\npossibilities. In traditional terms, he offers an extended\n indispensability argument\n for unactualised possibilities. But traditional terms are perhaps\nmisleading here. Lewis does not say that possibilities are absolutely\nindispensable, only that they make our philosophical theories so much\nbetter that we have sufficient reason to accept them.\n\nThere are four areas in which Lewis thinks that possible worlds earn\ntheir keep.\n\nModality: Traditional treatments of modal talk in\nterms of operators face several difficulties. They can\u2019t, at\nleast without significant cost, properly analyse talk about contingent\nexistence, or talk about modal comparatives, or modal supervenience\ntheses. All of these are easy to understand in terms of quantification\nacross possibilities.\nCloseness: Our best theory of counterfactuals,\nLewis\u2019s theory, relies on comparisons between possible worlds.\nIndeed, it relies on comparisons between this world and other worlds.\nSuch talk will be hard to paraphrase away if worlds aren\u2019t\nreal.\nContent: Lewis argues, in part following\nStalnaker (1984), that our best theory of mental and verbal content\nanalyses content in terms of sets of possibilities. This, in turn,\nrequires that the possibilities exist.\nProperties: We often appear to quantify over\nproperties. The modal realist can take properties to be sets of\npossibilia, and take such quantification at face value. In his\ndiscussion of properties here, Lewis expands upon his theory of\nnatural properties that he introduced in \u201cNew Work for a Theory\nof Universals\u201d, and that we discussed in section 3.\n\n\nAfter arguing that we are best off in all these areas of philosophy if\nwe accept unactualised possibilities, Lewis spends the rest of chapter\n1 saying what possible worlds are on his view. He isn\u2019t yet\narguing for this way of thinking about possible worlds; that will come\nin chapter 3. For now he is just describing what he takes to be the\nbest theory of possible worlds. He holds that possible worlds are\nisolated; no part of one is spatio-temporally related to any other\nworld. Indeed, he holds that lack of spatio-temporal relation (or\nsomething like it) is what marks individuals as being in different\nworlds. So his theory has the somewhat odd consequence that there\ncould not have been two parts of the world that aren\u2019t\nspatio-temporally connected. He holds that worlds are concrete, though\nspelling out just what the abstract/concrete distinction comes to in\nthis context isn\u2019t a trivial task. And he holds that worlds are\nplenitudinous, there are enough of them to do the work needed for an\nanalysis of modality. This requires at least that they satisfy a\nprinciple of recombination. But since it is possible that things are\ndifferent in kind to anything that actually exists, plenitude implies\nthat there are worlds that can\u2019t be made by simply putting parts\nof this world together. (Alastair Wilson (forthcoming) has a good survey of\nthe complicated relationship between plenitude and recombination.)\n6.2 Paradox in Paradise?\n\nChapter 2 deals with several objections to modal realism. Some of\nthese objections claim that modal realism leads to paradox. Other\nobjections claim that it undermines our ordinary practice. We will\nlook at two examples of each.\n\nPeter Forrest and D. M. Armstrong (1984) argue that modal realism\nleads to problems given the principle of recombination. An\nunrestricted principle of recombination says that for any things that\ncould exist, there is a world in which there is a duplicate of all of\nthem. Forrest and Armstrong apply the principle by taking the things\nto be the different possible worlds. A world containing a duplicate of\nall the worlds would, they show, be bigger than any world. But by the\nprinciple it would also be a world. Contradiction. Lewis\u2019 reply\nis to deny the unrestricted version of the principle. He insists that\nthere is independent reason to qualify the principle to those things\nwhose size and shape permits them to be fit into a single world.\nWithout an unrestricted principle of recombination, there is no way to\ncreate the large world that\u2019s at the heart of Forrest and\nArmstrong\u2019s paradox.\n\nDavid Kaplan argued that there could be no cardinality of the worlds.\nKaplan did not publish this argument, so Lewis replies to the version\npresented by Martin Davies (1981: 262). On Lewis\u2019s theory, every\nset of worlds is a proposition. For any proposition, says Kaplan, that\nproposition might be the only proposition being thought by a person at\nlocation l at time t. So for each proposition, there\nis a world where it (alone) is thought by a person at location\nl at time t. That means there is a one-one\ncorrespondence between the sets of worlds and a subset of the worlds.\nContradiction. Lewis\u2019s reply is to deny that every proposition\ncan be thought. He claims that functionalism about belief, plus the\nrequirement that beliefs latch onto relatively natural properties,\nmean that most propositions cannot be thought, and this blocks the\nparadox.\n\nPeter Forrest (1982) argues that modal realism leads to inductive\nscepticism. According to modal realism, there are other thinkers very\nmuch like us who are deceived by their surroundings. Given this, we\nshould doubt our inductive inferences. Lewis\u2019s reply is that\nmodal realism does not make inductive challenges any worse than they\nwere before. It is common ground that inductive inference is fallible.\nThat is, it is common ground that these inferences could fail.\nThinking of the possibilities of failure as concrete individuals might\nfocus the mind on them, and hence make us less confident, but does not\nseem to change the inference\u2019s justificatory status.\nLewis\u2019s argument seems hard to dispute here. Given the mutually\nagreed upon fact that the inference could fail, it\u2019s hard to see\nwhat epistemological cost is incurred by agreeing that it does fail\nfor someone kind of like the inferrer in a distant possible world.\n\nRobert Adams (1974) argues that modal realism leads to surprising\nresults in moral philosophy. The modal realist says that the way\nthings are, in the broadest possible sense, is not a contingent\nmatter, since we can\u2019t change the nature of the pluriverse.\nHence we cannot do anything about it. So if moral requirements flow\nfrom a requirement to improve the way things are, in this broadest\npossible sense, then there are no moral requirements. Lewis rejects\nthe antecedent of this conditional as something that only an extreme\nutilitarian could accept. What is crucial about morality is that\nwe not do evil. Even if their actions won\u2019t make a\ndifference to the nature of the pluriverse, a virtuous agent will not\nwant to, for instance, cause suffering. By rejecting the view that in\nour moral deliberations we should care about everyone, possible and\nactual, equally, Lewis avoids the problem.\n6.3 Paradise on the Cheap?\n\nIn chapter 3 Lewis looks at the alternatives to his kind of modal\nrealism. He takes himself to have established that we need to have\npossible worlds of some kind in our ontology, but not that these\npossible worlds must be concrete. In particular, they can be abstract,\nor what he calls \u201cersatz\u201d possible worlds. Lewis does not\nhave a single knock-down argument against all forms of ersatzism.\nInstead he divides the space of possible ersatzist positions into\nthree, and launches different attacks against different ones.\n\nLewis starts with what he calls \u201clinguistic ersatzism\u201d.\nThis is the view that ersatz possible worlds are representations, and\nthe way they represent possibilities is something like the way that\nlanguage represents possibilities. In particular, they represent\npossibilities without resembling possibilities, but instead in virtue\nof structural features of the representation.\n\nHe levels three main objections to linguistic ersatzism. First, it\ntakes modality as a primitive, rather than reducing modality to\nsomething simpler (like concrete possible worlds). Second, it\ncan\u2019t distinguish qualitatively similar individuals in other\npossible worlds. Lewis argues that will mean that we can\u2019t\nalways quantify over possibilia, as we can in his theory. Third, it\ncan\u2019t allow as full a range of \u2018alien\u2019, i.e.\nuninstantiated, natural properties as we would like. Sider (2002) has\nreplied that some of these challenges can be met, or at least reduced\nin intensity, if we take the pluriverse (i.e. the plurality of worlds)\nto be what is represented, rather than the individual worlds.\n\nThe second theory he considers is what he calls \u201cpictoral\nersatzism\u201d. This is the view that ersatz possible worlds are\nrepresentations, and the way they represent possibilities is something\nlike the way that pictures or models represent possibilities. That is,\nthey represent by being similar, in a crucial respect, to what they\nare representing. The pictoral ersatzist, says Lewis, is caught in\nsomething of a bind. If the representations are not detailed enough,\nthey will not give us enough possibilities to do the job that possible\nworlds need to do. If they are detailed enough to do that job, and\nthey represent by resembling possibilities, then arguably they will\ncontain as much problematic ontology as Lewisian concrete possible\nworlds. So they have the costs of Lewis\u2019s theory without any\nobvious advantage.\n\nThe final theory he considers is what he calls \u201cmagical\nersatzism\u201d. Unlike the previous two theories, this theory is\ndefined negatively. The magical ersatzist is defined by their denial\nthat possible worlds represent, or at least that they represent in\neither of the two ways (linguistic and pictoral) that we are familiar\nwith. And Lewis\u2019s primary complaint is that this kind of theory\nis mysterious, and that it could only seem attractive if it hides from\nview the parts of the theory that are doing the philosophical work.\nLewis argues that as soon as we ask simple questions about the\nrelationship that holds between a possibility and actuality if that\npossibility is actualised, such as whether this is an internal or\nexternal relation, we find the magical ersatzist saying things that\nare either implausible or mysterious.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear just who is a magical ersatzist. Lewis wrote that\nat the time he wrote Plurality no one explicitly endorsed\nthis theory. This was perhaps unfair to various primitivists\nabout modality, such as Adams (1974), Plantinga (1974) and Stalnaker\n(1976). Given the negative definition of magical ersatzism, and given\nthe fact that primitivists do not think that possible worlds represent\npossibilities via any familiar mechanism, it seems the primitivists\nshould count as magical ersatzists, or, as Lewis calls them,\n\u201cmagicians\u201d. In any case, if magical ersatzism, in all its\nvarieties, is objectionably mysterious, that suggests ersatzism is in\ntrouble, and hence if we want the benefits of possible worlds, we have\nto pay for them by accepting concrete possible worlds.\n6.4 Counterparts or Double Lives?\n\nThe last chapter of Plurality changes tack somewhat. Instead\nof focussing on different ways the world could be, Lewis\u2019s focus\nbecomes different ways things could be. The chapter defends, and\nexpands upon, Lewis\u2019s counterpart theory.\n\nCounterpart theory was first introduced by Lewis in \u201cCounterpart\nTheory and Quantified Modal Logic\u201d (1968) as a way of making\nmodal discourse extensional. Instead of worrying just what a name\ninside the scope of a modal operator might mean, we translate the\nlanguage of quantified modal logic into a language without operators,\nbut with quantifiers over worlds and other non-actual individuals. So\ninstead of saying \u25a1Fa, we say\n\u2200w\u2200x ((Ww \u2227 Ixw\n\u2227 Cxa) \u2283 Fx). That is, for all w\nand x, if w is a world, and x is in\nw, and x is a counterpart of a, then\nFx. Or, more intuitively, all of a\u2019s\ncounterparts are F. The paper shows how we can extend this\nintuitive idea into a complete translation from the language of\nquantfied modal logic to the language of counterpart theory. In\n\u201cTensions\u201d (1974a) Lewis retracts the claim that it is an\nadvantage of counterpart theory over quantified modal logic that it is\nextensional rather than intensional, largely because he finds the\ndistinction between these two notions much more elusive than he had\nthought. But he still thought counterpart theory had a lot of\nadvantages, and these were pressed in chapter 4.\n\nThe intuitive idea behind counterpart theory was that individuals, at\nleast ordinary individuals of the kind we regularly talk about, are\nworld-bound. That is, they exist in only one world. But they do not\nhave all of their properties essentially. We can truly say of a\nnon-contender, say Malloy, that he could have been a contender. In the\nlanguage of possible worlds, there is a possible world w such\nthat, according to it, Malloy is a contender. But what in turn does\nthis mean? Does it mean that Malloy himself is in w? Not\nreally, according to counterpart theory. Rather, a counterpart of\nMalloy\u2019s is a contender in w. And Malloy himself has\nthe modal property could have been a contender in virtue of\nhaving a counterpart in w who is a contender. This way of\nthinking about modal properties of individuals has, claims Lewis, a\nnumber of advantages.\n\nFor one thing, it avoids an odd kind of inconsistency. Malloy might\nnot only have been a contender, he might have been 6 inches taller. If\nwe think that is because there is a world in which Malloy himself is 6\ninches taller, then it seems like we\u2019re saying that Malloy can\nhave two heights, his actual height and one 6 inches taller. And that\nlooks inconsistent. The obvious way out of this is to say that he\nbears one height in relation to this world, and another to another\nworld. But that turns height from an intrinsic property into a\nrelation, and that seems like a mistake. Lewis thinks this problem,\nwhat he dubs the \u2018problem of accidental intrinsics\u2019, is a\nreason to deny that Malloy himself is in multiple worlds.\n\nFor another, it allows us a kind of inconstancy in our modal\npredications. Could Malloy have been brought by a stork, or must he\nhave had the parents he actually had? In some moods we think one, in\nother moods we think another. Lewis thinks that counterpart theory can\nreflect our indecision. There is a world with someone brought by a\nstork who has a life much like Malloy\u2019s. Is he one of\nMalloy\u2019s counterparts? Well, he is according to some counterpart\nrelations, and not according to others. When one of the former\nrelations is contextually salient, it\u2019s true to say that Malloy\ncould have been brought by a stork. When more demanding counterpart\nrelations are salient, he isn\u2019t one of Malloy\u2019s\ncounterparts, and indeed all of Malloy\u2019s counterparts share his\nparents. (More precisely, all of his counterparts have parents who are\ncounterparts of Malloy\u2019s actual parents.) In those contexts, it\nis true to say that one\u2019s parentage is essential. Throughout his\ncareer, Lewis uses this inconstancy of the counterpart relation to\nresolve all manner of metaphysical puzzles, from puzzles about\npersonal identity (1971c) to puzzles about truthmakers (2003b). The\nfinal section of Plurality is Lewis\u2019s most extended\nargument that this variability of the counterpart relation is a\nstrength, not a weakness, of the theory.\n7. Other Writings\n\nLewis wrote a lot that isn\u2019t covered by the broad categories\nwe\u2019ve discussed so far. The point of this section is to provide\na sample of that material. It isn\u2019t close to being\ncomprehensive. It doesn\u2019t include his treatment of\n qualia\n in (1988h) and (1995b). It doesn\u2019t include his contributions to\n causal decision theory\n in (1979e) and (1981b). It goes very quickly over his many papers in\nethics. And it skips his contributions to debates about non-classical\nlogics, such as (1982c) and (1990). We\u2019ve tried to restrict\nattention to those areas where Lewis\u2019s contributions were\ngroundbreaking, influential, and set out a new positive theory.\nShockingly, there is a lot to cover that meets those constraints, and\nis not included in the above survey of the major themes of his\nphilosophy.\n7.1 Mathematics and Mereology\n\nParts of Classes (1991a) and \u201cMathematics is\nMegethology\u201d (1993d) consider the distinctive philosophical\nproblems raised by\n set theory.\n As Lewis notes, it is widely held that all of mathematics reduces to\nset theory. But there is little consensus about what the metaphysics\nof set theory is. Lewis puts forward two proposals that might,\ncollectively, help to clarify matters.\n\nThe first proposal is what he calls the Main Thesis:\n\u201cThe parts of a class are all and only its subclasses\u201d\n(1991a: 7). By \u2018class\u2019 here, Lewis does not mean\n\u2018set\u2019. Classes are things with members. Some classes are\nproper classes, and hence not sets. And one set, the null set, has no\nmembers, so is not a class. Individuals, for Lewis, are things without\nmembers. Since the null set has no members, it is an individual. But\nthe overlap between the sets and the classes is large; most sets we\nthink about are classes.\n\nThe big payoff of the Main Thesis is that it reduces the mysteries of\nset theory to a single mystery. Any class is a\n fusion of singletons,\n i.e., sets with one member. If we understand what a singleton is, and\nwe understand what fusions are, then we understand all there is to\nknow about classes, and about sets. That\u2019s because any set is\njust the fusion of the singletons of its members.\n\nBut singletons are deeply mysterious. The usual metaphors that are\nused to introduce sets, metaphors about combining or collecting or\ngathering multiple things into one are less than useless when it comes\nto understanding the relationship between a singleton and its member.\nIn (1993d), Lewis settles for a structuralist understanding of\nsingletons. He also says that he \u201cargued (somewhat reluctantly)\nfor a structuralist\u2019 approach to the theory of singleton\nfunctions\u201d in (1991a), though on page 54 of (1991a) he appears\nto offer qualified resistance to structuralism.\n\nOne of the technical advances of (1991a) and (1993d) was that they\nshowed how a structuralist account of set theory was even possible.\nThis part of the work was co-authored with John P. Burgess and A. P.\nHazen. Given a large enough universe (i.e., that the cardinality of\nthe mereological atoms is an\n inaccessible cardinal),\n and given plural quantification, we can say exactly what constraints\na function must satisfy for it to do the work we want the singleton\nfunction to do. (By \u2018the singleton function\u2019 I mean the\nfunction that maps anything that has a singleton onto its singleton.\nSince proper classes don\u2019t have singletons, and nor do fusions\nof sets and objects, this will be a partial function.) Given that, we\ncan understand mathematical claims made in terms of sets/classes as\nquantifications over singleton functions. That is, we can understand\nany claim that would previous have used \u2018the\u2019 singleton\nfunction as a claim of the form for all s:\n\u2026s\u2026s\u2026, where the terms\ns go where we would previously have referred to\n\u2018the\u2019 singleton function. It is provable that this\ntranslation won\u2019t introduce any inconsistency into mathematics\n(since there are values for s), or any indeterminacy (since\nthe embedded sentence \u2026s\u2026s\u2026 has\nthe same truth value for any eligible value for s).\n\nShould we then adopt this structuralist account, and say that we have\nremoved the mysteries of mathematics? As noted above, Lewis is\nuncharacteristically equivocal on this point, and seemed to change his\nmind about whether structuralism was, all things considered, a good or\na bad deal. His equivocation comes from two sources. One worry is that\nwhen we work through the details, some of the mysteries of set theory\nseem to have been relocated rather than solved. For instance, if we\nantecedently understood the singleton function, we might have thought\nit could be used to explain why the set theoretic universe is so\nlarge. Now we have to simply posit a very large universe. Another is\nthat the proposal is in some way revisionary, since it takes ordinary\nmathematical talk to be surreptitiously quantificational. Parts of\nClasses contains some famous invective directed against\nphilosophers who seek to overturn established science on philosophical\ngrounds.\n\nI\u2019m moved to laughter at the thought of how presumptous\nit would be to reject mathematics for philosophical reasons. How would\nyou like the job of telling the mathematicians that they must\nchange their ways, and abjure countless errors, now that\nphilosophy has discovered that there are no classes? Can you\ntell them, with a straight face, to follow philosophical argument\nwherever it may lead? If they challenge your credentials, will you\nboast of philosophy\u2019s other great discoveries: that motion is\nimpossible, that a Being than which no greater can be conceived cannot\nbe conceived not to exist, that it is unthinkable that anything exists\noutside the mind, that time is unreal, that no theory has ever been\nmade at all probable by evidence (but on the other hand that an\nempirically adequate ideal theory cannot possibly be false), that it\nis a wide-open scientific question whether anyone has ever believed\nanything, and so on, and on, ad nauseum? Not me! (1991a: 59)\n\n\nAnd yet Lewis\u2019s positive theory here is somewhat revisionary. It\ndoesn\u2019t revise the truth value of any mathematical claim, but it\ndoes revise the understanding of them. Is even this too much revision\nto make on philosophical grounds? Perhaps not, but it is worrying\nenough for Lewis to conclude merely that the theory he proposes seems\nbetter than the alternatives, not that there is a compelling positive\ncase for its truth.\n7.2 Philosophy of Language\n\nLewis\u2019s major contribution to formal semantics was his theory of\ncounterfactual conditionals. But there were several other\ncontributions that he made, both on specific topics in formal\nsemantics, and on the role of semantic theory.\n\nIn \u201cAdverbs of Quantification\u201d (1975a), Lewis notes\nseveral difficulties in translating sentences involving\n\u201cusually\u201d, \u201cfrequently\u201d, \u201crarely\u201d\nor related adverbs into first-order logic or some similar formal\nsystem. Lewis\u2019s solution to the puzzles raised involves two\nformal advances. First, he treats the adverbs as unselective\nquantifiers, binding all free variables in their scope. The\nsecond advance concerns the if-clauses in sentences like Usually,\nif a team plays well, they win. It is difficult for various\nreasons to take the structure of this sentence to involve a quantifier\nover a compound sentence with a conditional connective. Lewis\u2019s\nsecond advance is to say that these if-clauses are simply domain\nrestrictors. The \u2018if\u2019 is no more a sentential connective\nthan the \u2018and\u2019 in New York is between Boston and\nWashington. Instead, the if-clause restricts what things the\nquantifier denoted by \u2018usually\u2019 ranges over.\n\nThis paper is not widely read by philosophers, but it has been very\ninfluential among linguists, especially semanticists. Indeed, its\nuptake by semanticists has made it the fourth most cited paper of\nLewis\u2019s on\n Google Scholar.\n His most cited paper on Google Scholar is also in philosophy of\nlanguage; it is \u201cScorekeeping in a Language Game\u201d\n(1979f).\n\nThat paper is about conversational dynamics. Lewis develops an\nextended analogy between the role of context in a conversation and the\nrole of score in a baseball game. One central role of the score is to\nkeep a record of what has already happened. In that way, score is\ninfluenced by what happens on the field, or in the conversation. But\nthe causal influence runs in the other way as well. Some events on the\nfield are influenced by the score. You\u2019re only out after the\nthird strike, for example. Similarly, Lewis holds that\ncontext (or the conversational score) can influence, or even be\npartially constitutive of, what happens in the conversation. If I say\n\u201cNone of the cats are afraid of Barney\u201d, which cats\nI\u2019ve managed to talk about depends on which cats are\nconversationally salient. And in saying this, I\u2019ve made Barney\nsalient, so the score changes in that respect. That change matters;\nnow I can denote Barney by \u201che\u201d.\n\nLewis argues that this model can make sense of a number of otherwise\npuzzling features of language. One notable example of this involves\nquantification. Most quantifiers we use do not range over the entire\nuniverse. We quantify only over a restricted range. Lewis says that it\nis the salient objects. He also says that this happens not just when\nwe explicitly quantify, but also when we use terms that have a\nquantificational analysis. He mentions in passing that\n\u201cknows\u201d might be one such term.\n\nThis idea is developed more fully in \u201cElusive Knowledge\u201d\n(1996b). Lewis argues that S knows that p is true iff\nS is in a position to rule out all possibilities in\nwhich p is false. But when we say S knows that p, we\ndon\u2019t mean to quantify over all possibilities there are, only\nover the salient possibilities. The big advantage of Lewis\u2019s\napproach is that it lets him explain the appeal of scepticism. When\nthe sceptic starts talking about fantastic possibilities of error, she\nmakes those possibilities salient. Since we can\u2019t rule them out,\nwhen we\u2019re talking to the sceptic we can\u2019t say we know\nvery much. But since those possibilities aren\u2019t usually salient,\nwe are usually correct in our knowledge-ascriptions. So Lewis lets the\nsceptic win any debate they are in, without conceding that ordinary\nknowledge-ascriptions are false.\n\nThe kind of position Lewis defends here, which came to be known as\n contextualism,\n has been a central focus of inquiry in epistemology for the last\nfifteen years. \u201cElusive Knowledge\u201d, along with papers such\nas Cohen (1986) and DeRose (1995) founded this research program.\n7.3 Bayesian Philosophy\n\nThis subsection is largely about two pairs of papers:\n\u201cProbabilities of Conditionals and Conditional\nProbabilities\u201d (1976b) and its sequel (1986h), and \u201cDesire\nas Belief\u201d (1988b) and its sequel (1996a). The papers have more\nin common than merely having a common naming convention.\n(They\u2019re not even Lewis\u2019s only sequels; \u201cLucas\nAgainst Mechanism\u201d (1969b) also has a sequel (1979d).) In both\ncases Lewis aims to defend orthodox\n Bayesian epistemology\n against some challenges. And in both cases the argument turns on\nprinciples to do with updating. Lewis was throughout his career a\nBayesian; he frequently said that the ideal epistemic agent was a\nBayesian conditionaliser and expected utility maximiser. And he\ndefended this position with some gusto.\n\nThe conditionals papers concern a position that was gaining popularity\nbefore Lewis showed it was untenable. The position in question starts\nwith the idea that a speaker can properly say Probably,\nif p, q if and only if their subjective probability\nof q given p is high. And the position then offers\nan explanation of this purported fact. The English word\n\u2018if\u2019 is a binary connective which forms a sentence to be\nwritten as p \u2192 q, and it is true in virtue of\nthe meaning of this connective that Pr(q |\np) = Pr(p \u2192 q). So, assuming\n\u2018probably\u2019 means something like subjective probability\nProbably, if p, q means that the subjective\nprobability of p \u2192 q, and, assuming the agent\nis coherent, that is true just in case the subjective probability of\nq given p is high.\n\nLewis doubted several aspects of this story. He briefly notes in\n\u201cAdverbs of Quantification\u201d that he didn\u2019t think the\n\u2018if\u2019 in Probably, if p, q is a\nbinary connective. But the more telling objection was his proof that\nthere could not be a connective \u2192 such that for all p,\nq, Pr(q | p) =\nPr(p \u2192 q). Lewis first argued for this\nin (1976b), and showed how to weaken some of the assumptions of the\nargument in (1986h). The effect of Lewis\u2019s position was to\nessentially end the hope of analysing English \u2018if\u2019 in\nterms of a binary connective with these probabilistic properties.\n\nThe desire papers (1988a, 1996b) are also about the Humean view that\nmotivation requires both a belief and a desire. Lewis aims to attack\nthe anti-Humean position that some beliefs, in particular beliefs that\na certain thing is good, can play the functional roles of both beliefs\nand desires. He argues that this is not, in general, possible. And the\nargument is that beliefs and desires update in different ways. Or, at\nleast, that anyone who updates their beliefs by conditionalisation and\nupdates their valuation functions in a plausible way, will not be able\nto preserve a perfect correlation between their desire for a\nproposition being true and their belief in that proposition\u2019s\ngoodness.\n\nBoth of these papers rely on the idea that conditionalisation is a\ngood way to update beliefs. Neither, by the way, rely on the idea that\nconditionalisation is the only rational way to update beliefs; the\narguments go through given merely the permissibility of\nconditionalising. Many Bayesians hold something stronger, namely that\nconditionalisation is the way to update beliefs. One widely\nused argument in favour of this position is a so-called \u2018Dutch\nBook\u2019 argument. This argument shows that if you plan to follow\nany strategy for revising beliefs other than conditionalisation, and\nyou do follow that strategy, then someone who knows the strategy that\nyou\u2019re going to follow can produce a series of bets that will\nseem favourable to you when each is offered, but which will\ncollectively lead to a sure loss. It is also true that if you do\nupdate by conditionalisation, there is no similar Dutch Book that can\nbe made, but Lewis did not prove this. (It is Theorem V in Skyrms\n(1987).) The Dutch Book argument for conditionalisation was introduced\nto the literature by Paul Teller (1976), who credited it to Lewis.\nLewis\u2019s own version of the argument did not appear until 1999,\nin Papers in Metaphysics and Epistemology, under the title\n\u201cWhy Conditionalize?\u201d (1999b). This was something he had\nwritten as a course handout in 1972, and which had been very widely\ncirculated, and, via Teller\u2019s paper, very influential on the\ndevelopment of Bayesian epistemology.\n\nLewis was an early proponent of one of the two major views about the\nSleeping Beauty puzzle, which is nicely described in Sorensen\n2009:\n\nSleeping Beauty is an ideal reasoner who knows she will be given a\nsleeping pill that induces limited amnesia. She knows that after she\nfalls asleep a coin will be flipped. If it lands heads, she will be\nawakened on Monday and asked: \u201cWhat is the probability that the\ncoin landed heads?\u201d. She will not be informed which day it is.\nIf the coin lands tails, she will be awaken on both Monday and on\nTuesday and asked the same question each time. The amnesia insures\nthat, if awakened on Tuesday she will not remember being woken on\nMonday. What will her answer be to the questions?\n\n\nThe puzzle was introduced to the philosophical community by Adam Elga\n(2000), who argued that when Beauty woke up, her credence in Heads\nshould be 1\u20443. Lewis argued that the\ncorrect answer was 1\u20442. The core of his\nargument was that before Beauty went to sleep, her credence in Heads\nshould be 1\u20442. That was agreed on all\nsides. Moreover, nothing happened that surprised Beauty. Indeed,\neverything happened exactly as she expected it would. Lewis argued\nthat \u201cOnly new relevant evidence, centred or uncentred, produces\na change in credence\u201d (2001c: 174), and that Beauty got no new\nevidence. This idea has featured heavily in subsequent work defending\nthe 1\u20442 answer to the Sleeping Beauty\npuzzle.\n\nThe Sleeping Beauty puzzle is important for another reason. As the\nquote above indicates, the puzzle is usually set up in terms of sets\nof centered worlds, following the work of Lewis we described in\nsection 4.5. The work generated by the puzzle has been one of the\nreasons that that work, in particular (1979b), has received a large\namount of attention in recent years.\n\n7.4 Philosophy of Religion\n\nIn \u201cAnselm and Actuality\u201d (1970a), Lewis tries to give as\ngood a formulation of the\n ontological argument\n as can be made in modal realist terms. This is a good framework for\ndiscussing the ontological argument, since on one interpretation, the\nargument rests crucially on cross-world comparisons of greatness and\nthe modal realist can make sense of that kind of talk better than\nviews that reject possible objects. Lewis argues that the principle\n\u201cA being than which nothing greater can be conceived is\npossible\u201d is crucially ambiguous. One kind of reading is that\nthe imagined being\u2019s greatness in its world is greater than the\ngreatness of any other being in that being\u2019s world. That may be\ntrue, but it doesn\u2019t imply that the being actually exists.\nAnother kind of reading focusses on the imagined being\u2019s\ngreatness in this world. It says that there (actually) is a being\nwhose actual greatness is greater than the greatness of any possible\nbeing. That entails the conclusion, but is not plausibly true. The\nbroader conclusion here, that the ontological argument derives its\npersuasive force from an equivocation, is one that has been widely\nadopted since Lewis\u2019s paper.\n\nIn \u201cEvil for Freedom\u2019s Sake\u201d (1993b), Lewis reflects\nat length on the\n free will defence\n to the\n problem of evil.\n Lewis argues that for the defence to work, God must make quite\ndifferent trade-offs between freedom and welfare than we are usually\ndisposed to make, and our understanding of what freedom consists in,\nand what divine foreknowledge consists in, must be different to what\nthey currently are.\n\nIn \u201cDo We Believe in Penal Substitution?\u201d (1997a), Lewis\nnotes that we only sometimes accept that one person can be properly\npunished for another\u2019s misdeeds. He uses this to raise an\ninteresting difficulty for the Christian idea that Christ died for our\nsins, suggesting this may not be a form of penal substitution that is\nnormally acceptable.\n\nIn \u201cDivine Evil\u201d (2007), Lewis suggests that proponents of\nthe problem of evil should not focus on what God fails to prevent, but\non what God does. In orthodox forms of theism, particularly\nChristianity and Islam, God is presented as perpetrating great evil\nagainst sinners of various stripes in the form of extreme punishments\nin the afterlife. Lewis suggests that a God that does would be so evil\nthat we should not only reject Him, but we may regard those who\nendorse the divine punishments as themselves somewhat culpable for\ndivine evil. (The published version of this paper was composed by\nPhillip Kitcher after Lewis\u2019s death from notes Lewis made, and\nconversations Kitcher had with Lewis.)\n7.5 Ethics\n\nLewis is obviously not as well known for his work in ethics as for his\nwork in other areas of philosophy. It was something of a surprise when\none of the volumes of his collected papers was called Papers in\nEthics and Social Philosophy (2000a). On the other hand, the\nexistence of this volume indicates that there is a large body of work\nthat Lewis put together in moral philosophy, very broadly construed.\nThere is very little secondary literature on Lewis\u2019s ethics.\nI\u2019m drawing heavily here on chapter 8 of Nolan (2005), and\nKeller (2015).\n\nAs Nolan suggests, the least inaccurate summary of Lewis\u2019s\nethical positions is that he was a\n virtue ethicist.\n Indeed, a focus on virtue, as opposed to consequences, plays a role\nin his defence of modal realism, as we saw in section 6.4. Nolan also\nnotes that this position is somewhat surprising. Most philosophers who\naccept views related to Lewis\u2019s about psychology and\ndecision-making (in particular, who accept a Humean story about\nbeliefs and desires being the basis for motivation, and who accept\nsome or other version of expected utility maximisation as the basis\nfor rational decision) have broadly consequentialist positions. But\nnot Lewis.\n\nLewis was also a\n value pluralist\n (1984a, 1989b, 1993b). Indeed, this was part of his objection to\nconsequentialism. He rejected the idea that there was one summary\njudgment we could make about the moral value of a person. In\n\u201cReply to McMichael\u201d (1978a) he complains about the\nutilitarian assumption that \u201cany sort or amount of evil can be\nneutralized, as if it had never been, by enough countervailing good\n\u2014and that the balancing evil and good may be entirely\nunrelated\u201d (1978a: 85).\n\nIn meta-ethics, Lewis defended a variety of\n subjectivism\n (1989b). Like many subjectivists, Lewis held that something is\nvaluable for us if and only if we would value it under ideal\ncircumstances. And he held, following Frankfurt (1971), that valuing\nsomething is simply desiring to desire it. What is distinctive about\nLewis\u2019s position is his view about what ideal circumstances are.\nHe thinks they are circumstances of \u201cfull imaginative\nacquaintance\u201d. This has some interesting consequences. In\nparticular, it allows Lewis to say that different goods have different\nconditions of full imaginative acquaintance. It might, he suggests, be\nimpossible to properly imagine instantiating several different values\nat once. And that in turn lets him argue that his value pluralism is\nconsistent with this kind of subjectivism, in a way that it might not\nbe consistent with other varieties of subjectivism.\n\nLewis also wrote several more papers in applied ethics. In two\ninteresting papers on\n tolerance\n (1989a, 1989d), he suggests that one reason for being tolerant, and\nespecially of being tolerant of speech we disapprove of, comes from\ngame-theoretic considerations. In particular, he thinks our motivation\nfor tolerance comes from forming a \u2018tacit treaty\u2019 with\nthose with differing views. If we agree not to press our numerical\nsuperiority to repress them when we are in the majority, they will do\nthe same. So tolerating opposing views may be an optimal strategy for\nanyone who isn\u2019t sure that they will be in the majority\nindefinitely. In these works it is easy to see the legacies of\nLewis\u2019s early work on philosophical lessons to be drawn from\ngame theory, and especially from the work of Thomas Schelling.\n7.6 Applied Metaphysics\n\nThere\u2019s much more that could be said about Lewis\u2019s\ncontributions to philosophy, but we\u2019ll end with a discussion of\ntwo wonderful pieces of applied metaphysics.\n\nIn \u201cThe Paradoxes of Time Travel\u201d (1976d), Lewis discusses\nthe many complicated philosophical issues about\n time travel.\n He discusses\n temporal parts,\n personal identity, causation and causal loops, free will, and the\ncomplications arising from our many different modal concepts. In some\ncases he uses the canvas provided to illustrate his own take on the\nmetaphysical issues that arise. But in some cases he notes that the\nproblems that arise are problems for everyone.\n\n\u201cHoles\u201d (Lewis and Lewis 1970) was co-written with\nStephanie Lewis. In it they discuss, in dialog form, some of the\nmetaphysical issues that holes generate. One of the characters, Argle,\nwants to eliminate holes from his ontology, and the paper goes over\nwhat costs must be met to make this form of\n nominalism\n work. The other character, Bargle, pushes Argle to clarify his\ncommitments, and in doing so draws out many details of the nominalist\nframework. The case is of some interest in itself, but it is also, as\nthe authors note at the end, a useful case-study in the kind of moves\nnominalists can make in eliminating unwanted ontology, and the costs\nof those moves.\n\nEach paper can be, and indeed often has been, used for introducing\ncomplicated metaphysical issues to students. The papers are, like many\nof Lewis\u2019s papers, widely anthologised. They are both excellent\nillustrations of the fact that, as well as being a wonderful\nphilosopher, Lewis was one of the best philosophical writers of his\ntime.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Cited Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "1966a, \u201cAn Argument for the Identity Theory,\u201d\n<em>Journal of Philosophy</em>, 63: 17\u201325.", "1966b, \u201cPercepts and Color Mosaics in Visual\nExperience,\u201d <em>Philosophical Review</em>, 75:\n357\u2013368.", "1966 (with Jane S.
