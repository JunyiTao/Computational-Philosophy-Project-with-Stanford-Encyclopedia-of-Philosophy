    "main_text": "The Problem of Moral Change || The Argument from Posterity\n5.1 The Argument from Posterity\n\n\nLike other enlightenment thinkers, Crummell takes posterity very\nseriously, urging his contemporaries to moral action that will create a\nlegacy that later generations will both enjoy and emulate. His\nreasoning is relatively straightforward, pivoting on the idea that the\nmain conceptual artifact of a people is their national culture.\n\nNational culture captures a complex idea for Crummell. On the\none hand, he argues that each generation has a duty to the\nfuture\u2014specifically, a duty to make the future better than the\npast\u2014an obligation he often described in terms of\n\u201ccivilization.\u201d Civilization thus accumulates all of the\ngreatest symbolic achievements of the past: literature, philosophy,\nthe arts, and so on. But that does not happen\nwithout cultivating the population whose symbolic\nachievements are thus collected. What we would today call\nculture, with little or none of his idea of progress and\nimprovement, Crummell and his contemporaries thought of as that\nwhich is so cultivated, and hence is prepared to add to\ncivilization. But while civilization is for everyone\u2014it is\nuniversal, Crummell would say\u2014culture is particular to this or that\ngroup, this or that nation. National culture is thus that set\nof symbolic achievements made by a particular (national) group for the\ngood of universal (world) civilization. The Negro, in the idiom of\nCrummell's day, has no less obligation than any other \u201cnation\u201d to make\na cultural contribution to civilization. \n\n\nHe understands moral change, in part, as a condition for such a\nculture to be possible, so it is not surprising that he recognizes a\ncollective duty to satisfy that condition. His is a particularly\naggressive account, in that the duties to posterity are categorical and\nuniversal, setting the price blacks have to pay to affect the course of\nhistory.\n\n\nHistory, to Crummell's mind, is the series of events that concerns the\nprogress of civilization. As various groups produce their symbolic\ninstitutions, and as those national cultures improve humanity's state\nof civilization, forward progress is being achieved, and the\nback-and-forth of ordinary life is getting closer to achieving the\nfundamental pre-existing nature of things as they really are. Crummell\nclearly subscribes (as did Plato) to a strong version of this view of\nhistory. On Plato's version, the ordinary events we now simply call\n\u201chistory\u201d\u2014wars, recessions, presidential elections,\netc.\u2014are part of the changing world of approximations and\ninexactness. As such, they are in flux, becoming one thing after\nanother, but never actually being anything permanent. But the\npre-existing principles that underwrite moral reasoning are timeless\nand unchanging\u2014and hence permanent.  History cannot be about\nwhat is transient, despite the passage of time it implies; rather, it\nis about what endures through the passage of time.\n\n\nThis is actually not as foreign to contemporary notions as it may\nseem. True, we keep a historical record, which is meant to keep track\nof the affairs of human societies, without prejudice or interpretation.\nBut the record we keep is updated as we begin to grasp the impact the\nrecorded events have on the future and what we take to be our\ncollective destiny. Consider the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the U.S. The\ninitial event was confusing because, though devastating, it was not\nclear whether its impact was on foreign policy and affairs of state\n(that is, whether it was an act of war) or on domestic policy and\ncriminal justice (that is, whether it was a criminal act), a question\nthat still seems unsettled. Of course, there is no controversy about\nthe fact that some event occurred. It is that we do not (yet)\nhave a settled description of those facts; hence the history\nof that event is not yet written. Indeed, history in our day is very\nmuch an assessment of the record in light of our future, an uncertain\nand ongoing conversation by a nation about itself.\n\n\nCrummell is more modern than Plato, in the sense that he orients the\nquestion of history from the perspective of the nation and its culture\nthat is trying to understand its place with respect to civilization.\nFor Plato, the orientation is that of the universal truths\u2014we might\nsay it is cosmic\u2014and so our response to them is more derivative and\nsecondary. Plato might say that the Negro is trying to engage the\ntimeless truths of civilization in order to realize what the true\nnature of reality is like. Crummell would emphasize instead that it is\nthe Negro who helps make that reality present itself to us as it\ndoes\u2014its timeless nature is timeless, to be sure, but it is a central\ncharacter in the drama of history in our moment and as we\nsee it. It is in our time that it will act, just as it is in our\ntime that we will bring about the progress to be achieved.\n\n\nThe Argument from Posterity begins with Crummell's\nobservation that individuals have some \u201crelation\u201d to the\n\u201centire race\u201d; \u201ca nation is a collection of\nmen\u2026of the same make, and nature, and appetencies, and destiny,\nas ourselves\u201d comprising but a \u201csection of the great\ncommonwealth of humanity, a phase of the common type of being, and no\nmore\u201d (\u201cThe Duty of a Rising Christian State\u201d\n[FA], 59\u201360). The moral moment in our common destiny is\nto \u201cgo forward and upward\u201d (63). The movement of national\nculture through time is thus singular (neither multiple nor\ndiverse, even if diversely contributed to), progressive\n(movement leads to improvement), and ultimately unifying. It\nis as if \u201call the preceding generations of mankind, and all the\nvarious nations, have lived for every successive generation,\u201d\nsuggesting that there is \u201cno absolute disseverance of individual\nnations\u201d (63\u201364).\n\n\nKant's insistence that human history is the working out of\n\u201cnature's plan\u201d to realize the full natural capacities of\nhumans in society anticipates Crummell's social progressivism\n(\u201cIdea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan\nPurpose,\u201d proposition 8). For Kant the ultimate goal was the\nperfect form of civil society; so too for Crummell, though his vision\nreserves a central driving role to the character of agents, moreso\nthan to the justice of actions. This shouldn't be overstated of\ncourse. Kant clearly regarded enlightenment as a triumph of\n\u201cculture\u201d over \u201cbarbarism\u201d as he took it to be\nthe generalizing of principles of justice. But Crummell's\nunderstanding of the duty to posterity seems much more entangled with\nthe fidelity of the Negro to Moral Principles than the\njustice of those Principles.\n\n\nIf Crummell is more modern than Plato, Kant's view of historical\nprogress is more modern than Crummell's. Though both Kant and Crummell\nsee and evaluate the sweep of historical events from the standpoint of\na particular group or individual, Kant thought that the kind of\nsignificant history Crummell worried about blacks contributing to was\nnot even possible without robust self-awareness. It is only when\nsomeone can reason about their actions by observing them\nlogically\u2014that is, as a rational law-giver might\u2014that\nself-awareness has been minimally achieved. So for Kant the ultimate\nobligation of a modern society is to preserve such moral autonomy;\nindeed, it is an important condition for enlightenment.\n\n\nCrummell's philosophy is less modern than Kant's given Crummell's\ninsistence on the importance of one's racial nature in helping create\nthe conditions for morality and history (cf. Kirkland\n1992\u20131993). The duty Crummell has in mind is to the Mental and\nMoral Principles that comprise progressive reason. It has little to do\nwith whatever group one belongs to, though one's contribution is at\nleast partly determined by the national character of their people or\nrace. In any case the progress of reason is the moral determiner;\n\u201cour life, our culture, and our civilization are but the result\nof the ceaseless energy of mind and body of all past nations\u201d\n(\u201cRising Christian State,\u201d 64). This all furthers the effort to \u201ccultivate men,\u201d\nnurturing \u201cthat largeness of soul\u2014that quick, glad\nrecognition of noble principles\u2014that love of and reverence for\nfixed and eternal truth\u2014that eager desire for the work of\nlife\u201d (74). This is a prerequisite for a national culture, since\nnations need \u201ccitizens with large, expanded minds, a fine\nculture, with natural or acquired manners, and a constant delicate\nhonor\u201d (74). There is a collective duty to enhance the\ncivilizing potential of civilizing rational principles because of its\npotential to further civilize in the future, something that is\nintrinsically valuable. The associated duty to the land of one's\nfathers is implied by a duty of self-respect, given the common\n\u201cnegro blood flowing in his veins\u201d (\u201cThe Relations\nand Duty of Free Colored Men\u201d [FA], 219). This duty is\nall the more urgent because of Africa's \u201cbenightedness,\u201d\nand it is all the more binding because of the Kantian focus on\nnature's plan, understood in social context. Crummell appeals here to\nthe self-regard of black Americans\u2014\u201cin its normal state\nand in its due degree\u2026 \u2018is as just and morally good as\nany affection whatever\u2019 \u201d (221, Crummell quoting\nButler)\u2014to motivate their sense of duty to black Africans.\n\n\nIt is hard to read Crummell and not recall the problem of evil that\nhaunts providential philosophies of history. If history unfolds as God\nsees fit, then why do such devastating historical wrongs as American\nslavery occur? It seems that either God is unable to prevent\nsuch wrongs (but isn't God all-powerful?), God is unaware that\nthey are occurring (but isn't God all-knowing?), or that God is\nunwilling to stop such wrongs (but isn't God all-good?). None\nof those options is available to the providential philosopher of\nhistory, since if God lacked any one of those traits then he cannot be\nthe God that drives history. Instead, he would be as we are, characters\ntrying to impact the course of history.\n\n\nCrummell has a few responses to this problem. One is the classic\nreply of theists, that God allows evil passively, and does so with\ncharacter-building and moral instruction in mind. And of course\nCrummell is acutely aware that humans are capable of great moral evil.\nIt is not so much that God is unable to stop evil as that humanity is\nso able at propagating it.\n\n\nBut there's another kind of response that can be teased out of\nCrummell. His is a Platonic metaphysics, so for him reality is that\nunchanging pre-existing world of fundamental principles and concepts.\nThat which is good is so due to the unchanging (and unrealized in the\neveryday world) nature of that which is good in itself. A sophisticated\nPlatonist with a theistic overlay like Crummell sees evil only when the\ngood in itself has been corrupted, which is impossible since\nthe good is an abstract timeless object. Of course there is suffering\nin our shadowy transient realm; that is regrettable in the strongest\nterms possible. But that is due to our imperfect grasp of the timeless\nnature of the good. It is the good itself which persists, accounting\nfor our achievement of a better future. The problem of evil is thus a\nkind of misdirection; the real issue is the problem of our ignorance of\nthe good, which indicts us, not God.\n\n\nCrummell's Kantian point helps make his larger argument clearer in\nanother way as well. The progressivism that both thinkers urged is\nrooted in a common view about nature's endowing humans with various\ncapacities. While for Kant that positions the argument for the\nprogress of reason, Crummell sees it widening the ensemble of factors\ntoward progress. For instance, commerce is praised for the civilizing\nrole it plays, and yet, as he observes, the slave trade (clearly\na destructive force) was the main commercial activity in Africa. Given\nthe natural resources of West Africa, that could easily be\nchanged. The \u201cacquisitive principle\u201d combined with\nproductive labor can lead to civilization, \u201cuplift[ing] and\nenlighten[ing] the heathen!\u201d (\u201cDuty of Free Colored Men,\u201d 229\u201330).  This is an\nopportunity that should not be squandered. \u201cIf the black\nman\u2026civilized and enlightened\u201d enjoys \u201ca golden\nheritage, and fails to seize upon and to appropriate it, Providence\nnone the less intends it to be seized upon and wills it to be\nused,\u201d implying that whites who capitalize on the opportunity to\ncreate wealth would be justified (231). The heart of the argument is\ncommerce's ability to create conditions for order and comfort from\ndisorder and wildness.  Moral consequences follow, including the\ndesire for industry, the need for planning, and the creation of future\nchances for increased wealth.  Self-reliance thus occupies a central\nplace as a primary virtue of the civilized; the principle of\nacquisition and the efforts it generates at self-support and\nself-reliance lead to profitable commerce and investment, ultimately\ngenerating moral improvement, all in keeping with\nprovidence. \u201c[B]lack men in Africa must do what enterprising men\ndo in all other new lands: they must BEND NATURE TO THEIR WANTS AND\nWISHES\u201d (253). Of course this confidence in the moral\nimprovement conferred by labor and industry was widely held\u2014by\nKant too\u2014but in Crummell's thinking it is inextricably rooted in\nAfrica as well as the agrarian American South, and so the civilizing\nthat he thought blacks needed required an investment in lands they\nfound themselves in, or had an original bond to.\n\n\nLiberia crystallizes these strands of argument; its founders sought to\nestablish a \u201ccivilized nationality\u201d there, as Crummell\ndescribes it (\u201cThe Responsibility of the First Fathers of a\nCountry\u201d [AA], 132). That was their \u201ctremendous\nresponsibility\u201d and \u201cgreat obligation,\u201d namely,\n\u201cto act as worthy trustees of distant generations and of future\ntimes.\u201d They exemplified what he thinks is required to fulfill\nthe duty to future progress. What remains is the need to link\n\u201csentiment\u201d and \u201coutward forms and symbols\u201d\n(134); such is the substance of national cultures. Civil government is\nnot the main site of this experiment in making a national culture, but\nits structure matters since \u201cman's opportunities for personal\nfreedom, for intellectual advancement, for social comfort, for\ndomestic bliss, and for religious growth, depend very measurably upon\nhis civil status\u201d (135). The nature of this dependence runs\ndeep, and may even be organic: \u201can ennobled manhood and the\nmasculine virtues are generally the fruits of distinct national\nsystems\u201d; \u201cthe spirit of a people and their form of\ngovernment are mostly reciprocal; \u2026for the higher kind of human\ncharacter, you are forced to seek an analogy of rule and system as its\nparent.\u201d This underwrites a sorting of national cultures.\n\u201cAll the art, the refinement, the magnificence of Paris [will]\nfail to realize that ideal of human government which is the aspiration\nof every free soul,\u201d he writes, \u201cand which is an essential\nelement in the growth of free and manly character\u201d (136). But we\nare political agents, and this culture is something we need to take an\nactive role in making. We are creators in the sense that we can act in\nan unconstrained way. But the range of choices of government is\nlimited to free or repressive; one or the other must come to be. He\nargues that that is a matter of necessity since, \u201caccording\nto the constitution of things, no other political systems than\nthese can exist\u201d (137). It is our choosing that\ndetermines which comes to be. He obviously endorses a free civil\ngovernment, and his posing of a choice to his audience in keeping with\nhis set-up of the question is meant to make the point that free\ngovernment is preferable because it leads to human flourishing. It is\nless a political philosophy than a social and moral philosophy; the\ninstitutions that make our collective social efforts effective ought\nto be free in order to enable us to become civilized, noble, and\nenlightened, leading to \u201ca system which will enlarge the souls\nof men\u201d and \u201cgive them manhood and superiority\u201d\n(139). A free system thus \u201cdistinguishes calm Republicanism from\nwild and lawless Democracy.\u201d The institutional framework of\naction thus creates the space for the individual moral life, that\n\u201cgood\u201d life one tries to make for oneself.  Such a system\n\u201cstarts men in the race for improvement\u2026seeks their moral\nelevation, and aims to strengthen their souls\u201d (140).\n\n\nIt is clear that Crummell thinks races ought to make nations as\ntheir instrument of civilizing uplift, but it is nowhere evident that\nhe thinks races are the objects of that uplift. Instead, civilization\nis a good in itself, and ought to frame the political goals of a free\nnation. The principle that makes this go is \u201cthat organic principle\nof being which binds the present to the future, under a sense of duty\nand responsibility\u201d (\u201cFirst Fathers,\u201d 141). He isn't shy at any point in his\nanalysis. The problem of moral flourishing is one that has a\npolitical-institution component, but it is just as obvious to him that\nit has a metaphysical component, namely the linkage through time of\nhuman actions and how they bear on future effects. \u201cAccording to the\norganization of our being,\u201d he observes, \u201cwe are unable to confine\nourselves to the mere brief period of life allotted us in this world.\nNo man can thus make his life a disconnected, isolated unit\u201d (141).\nThis part of the argument proceeds in several stages. First, since\nhuman action is diachronic, so too is human agency. And second, since\nhuman kinds (races) have a cultural and moral component, agency is not\nwithout contextualizing factors, as \u201cone generation is, of necessity,\nthe framer and shaper of both the character and the destiny of another\u201d\n(145\u201346). This obligates present agents since \u201cthe character of a\npeople is a continuous and integral quality\u201d shared by ancestor and\ndescendant alike. Hence Crummell lays the groundwork for his moral\nprogressivism, especially as it applies to blacks. The remaining\ndifficulty is to explain how moral change is possible.\n",
