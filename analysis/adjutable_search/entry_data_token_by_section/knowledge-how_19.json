    "main_text": "The Argument from Cognitive Science || Knowledge-How in Preverbal Children and Nonhuman Animals\n7.4 Knowledge-How in Preverbal Children and Nonhuman Animals\n\nA final objection is that intellectualism overintellectualizes\nknowledge-how in a way that is incompatible with what we know about\nanimals\u2019 cognition (No\u00eb 2005; Hornsby 2007; Dreyfus 2007;\nElzinga forthcoming). According to this objection, unsophisticated and\nnon- (or pre-) linguistic agents such as babies and non-human animals\ncan know how to perform certain tasks, while lacking the concepts that\nare required for propositional knowledge. Some intellectualists\nrespond that ordinary speakers routinely also ascribe propositional\nknowledge to animals and babies, as we say that Fido knows that its\nowner is arriving or that a baby knows that their mother is present\n(Stanley & Williamson 2001). Thus, while propositional knowledge\nmay require concept possession, our ordinary knowledge ascriptions\nsuggest that we regard relatively unsophisticated agents as possessing\nthe relevant concepts. Comparative psychologists do routinely credit\nmany non-human and non-linguistic animals with the possession of\nconcepts. (See Allen & Bekoff 1999 for a comprehensive overview).\n\n\nThis response might be less plausible, though, when it comes to lower\nanimals, or insects. Here too, we might describe ants as knowing how\nto carry food back to their nest. And yet, there is less evidence from\ncognitive science that insects are capable of concepts too (though see\nGallistel & King 2009). In response, a different line of argument\nmight be more promising (cf. McDowell 2007): it does not follow from\nthe fact that we are disposed to ascribe knowledge-how to lower\nanimals that what explains their goal-directed behavior is the same\nsort of psychological state that underlies human knowledge-how and\nhuman action. For from the fact that their behavior resembles\nhumans\u2019 in some respects (for example, in its goal-directedness)\ndoes not entail that it resembles humans\u2019 skilled behavior in\nall respects that matter (for example, in the susceptibility\nof the relevant behavior to rational revision).\n",
