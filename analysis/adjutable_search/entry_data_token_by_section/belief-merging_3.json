    "main_text": "Belief merging applied to the discursive dilemma || Extensions and criticisms\n3.1 Extensions and criticisms\n\nThe minisum rule applied to merge the judgment sets of the\nthree judges in the previous section is based on the same principles\nas the Kemeny rule, a well-known preference aggregation rule\n(Kemeny 1959). Unlike what happened in social choice, at the beginning\nthe literature of judgment aggregation focused on the axiomatic method\nand only few concrete aggregation rules were proposed and studied.\nArguably, the interest of researchers from computer science and\nmulti-agent systems for judgment aggregation lead to the definition of\nmore concrete aggregation rules and to the investigation of their\nrelations. The same idea of minimization that plays such a crucial\nrole in belief merging can be found as a principle in the definition\nof several voting rules in social choice theory. For instance, the\nminisum rule turned out to be equivalent to several other\nrules recently introduced in the judgment aggregation literature (Lang\net al. 2017).\n\nThe interest of computer scientists for aggregation methods is\nwitnessed by the fact that judgment aggregation is now among the\ntopics of computational social choice, an interdisciplinary discipline\nthat promotes exchanges and interactions between computer science and\nsocial choice theory. Computational issues of aggregation rules are\namong the interests of computational social choice. The intuition\nbehind the application of complexity theory to aggregation rules is to\nassess the acceptability of an aggregation rule on the basis of\npragmatic considerations, that is, the algorithmic feasibility of\napplying that rule. So, an aggregation rule is acceptable when its\noutcome is \u2018easy\u2019 to compute, that is, it can be solved by\nan algorithm in time which grows \u2013 at worst \u2013 polynomially with the\nsize of the input (only in some pathological cases we can imagine\ndesiring a rule that will not be able to return an outcome in a\nforeseeable future). On the other hand, if an aggregation rule is\nmanipulable, then it is acceptable when it is \u2018hard\u2019 for\nan individual to manipulate it. Thus, the study of the computational\ncomplexity of aggregation rules may reveal that, even though a rule is\nmanipulable, it is actually hard for an individual to act on that. The\ncomputational complexity of the distance-based procedures has been\nstudied (Endriss et al. 2012; Endriss and de Haan 2015). The high\ncomputational complexity of Hamming rule in judgment aggregation\nmirrors a parallel result that the Kemeny rule in preference\naggregation is also highly computational complex, as first shown in\nBartholdi et al. (1989) and Hudry (1989). A new rule has been proposed\nto overcome the high computational complexity of distance-based\nprocedures. The average-voter rule (Grandi 2012) selects the judgment\nset submitted by the individuals that minimizes the sum of the\ndistances. Hence, the outcome has to be one of the submitted judgment\nsets. This allows reducing the computational complexity and, at the\nsame time, selects the most representative individual.\n\nA generalization of distance-based methods for judgment aggregation\nhas been given in (Miller and Osherson 2009). Besides generalizing (by\ntaking a general metric) the merging operator we have applied to the\ndoctrinal paradox, they proposed three other distance-based procedures\nfor judgment aggregation. In case proposition-wise majority collapses\ninto an inconsistent collective judgment set, one method\n(Endpoint) selects as group outcome the closest (according to\nsome distance metric) consistent collective judgment set. The other\ntwo methods (Full and Output) look at minimal ways\nto change the profile in order to output a consistent proposition-wise\nmajority collective judgment set. The difference is that\nOutput allows the individual judgment sets in the modified\nprofile to be inconsistent.\n\nDuddy and Piggins (2012) questioned the use of Hamming distance\nbetween judgment sets. The problem is that, when the agenda contains\npropositions that are logically connected, the Hamming distance may be\nresponsible of double counting because it ignores such\ninterdependencies. Suppose, for example, that two individuals accept\npropositions q but disagree on \\(p\\land q\\) (so, one individual\naccepts the conjunction, while the other rejects it). This can happen\nonly if they disagree on p. The Hamming distance between the\ntwo judgment sets \\(K_1 = \\{\\neg p, q, \\neg(p\\land q)\\}\\) and \\(K_{2}\n= \\{p, q, (p\\land q)\\}\\) is 2. It is the disagreement on p that\nimplies the disagreement over \\(p\\land q\\), so the distance should be\njust 1. The alternative distance proposed in order to address this\nproblem is a distance that takes the smallest number of logically\ncoherent changes needed to convert one judgment set into the\nother.\n4. Other topics\n\nBelief merging is an abstract theory that addresses the problem of\naggregating symbolic inputs, without specifying whether such items are\nbeliefs, knowledge, desires, norms etc. It is the choice of the\nmerging operator that should best suit the type of inputs. The\nframework of judgment aggregation has also been extended to include\nthe aggregation of other types of attitudes, as in (Dietrich and List\n2010).\n\nThe literature on belief merging includes the study of the strategic\nmanipulation problem (Evaraere et al. 2007). When an aggregation\nprocedure is not strategy-proof, an individual who has a preference\nover the possible outcomes can manipulate the result by lying on her\ntrue beliefs and thus obtain an outcome closer to her true\npreferences. In general, merging operators are not strategy-proof when\nHamming distance is used, whereas they are strategy-proof when the\ndrastic distance is employed. For a recent survey of results on\nstrategic behaviour in judgment aggregation, see (Baumeister et al.\n2017).\n\nIn those situations in which we can assume that there is a fact of the\nmatter (for example, a defendant has\u2014or has not\u2014committed\na murder), which each agent has a (noisy) opinion about, the\ntruth-tracking properties of belief merging operators can be\ninvestigated (Hartmann et al. 2010; Hartmann and Sprenger 2012;\nCevolani 2014). The question is then whether a certain aggregation\nmethod selects the right decision. Williamson (2009) argues that\naggregating the evidence on which the judgments are based is\nbest for judgment aggregation, as it would yield to the right\ndecision. The three-step proposal he advocates distinguishes between\nthree types of propositions: evidence, beliefs and judgments. Evidence\nis the support for an agent\u2019s beliefs and judgments, and it is\nthe right candidate for merging techniques. Judgments, on the other\nhand, are best dealt with decision theory that maps degrees of beliefs\nand utilities to judgments.",
