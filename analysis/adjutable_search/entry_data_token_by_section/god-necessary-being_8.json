    "main_text": "God\u2019s Grounding Abstract Objects II: Views on Which There Aren\u2019t Necessarily Existing Abstract Objects that All Are Grounded in God || Theistic Platonism\n4.1 Theistic Platonism\n\nAccording to the theistic Platonist, there are at least some\nnecessarily existing abstract objects (e.g., propositions, properties,\nrelations, numbers, and states of affairs), and the existence of all\nof the necessarily existing abstracta is not grounded in God. Peter\nvan Inwagen (2009) is a paradigm case of a theistic Platonist. As we\nsaw earlier, van Inwagen argues that if necessarily existing abstract\nobjects were grounded in God, they would be caused to exist by God.\nBut necessarily existing abstracta can\u2019t enter into causal\nrelations. So they aren\u2019t grounded in God. He says:\n\n\nIn the end, I can find no sense in the idea that God creates free\nabstract objects [things like propositions, relations, numbers,\nproperties, etc.], no sense in the idea that the existence of free\nabstract objects in some way depends on the activities of God. (Recall\nthat, although I believe that all abstract objects are free,\nthat is not a position that I am concerned to defend in this chapter.)\nAnd that is because the existence of free abstract objects depends on\nnothing. Their existence has nothing to do with causation\u2026\nCausation is simply irrelevant to the being (and the\nintrinsic properties) of abstract objects (2009: 18).\n\n\nVan Inwagen takes his most serious challenge to be from religious\ntexts that he, as a Christian, thinks are authoritative. He speaks\nparticularly of the beginning of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed,\nwhich begins, \u201cI believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker\nof heaven and earth, of all that is seen and unseen\u201d. He thinks\nhere that the quantifier in \u201call that is seen and unseen\u201d\nis restricted to things that are capable of entering into causal\nrelations and thus are capable of being created. As van Inwagen points\nout, there are other authoritative Christian texts in which a\nuniversal quantifier is read in a restricted manner (e.g., Matthew\n19:26 \u201cfor God all things are possible\u201d; see also Luke\n1:37, Mark 10:27). No such passage should be taken as a prooftext for\na Cartesian view of omnipotence. Rather, the quantifier is read in a\nrestricted manner. Similarly, the quantifier is restricted in the case\nof the beginning of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed.\n\nIt is worth noting that van Inwagen\u2019s argument here is slightly\ndifferent from one that often occurs around these sorts of texts.\nOften, there is discussion as to whether the writers of the\nauthoritative texts had in mind things like necessarily existing\nabstracta (e.g., Wolterstorff 1970: 293; Morris and Menzel 1986: 354).\nTo the person who says that the writers of these texts didn\u2019t\nhave, say, structured propositions in mind when they claimed God\ncreated everything; it is pointed out that neither did they have in\nmind (clearly-created) things like quarks and bosons (e.g., Davidson\n1999: 278\u2013279). Rather, van Inwagen argues that a text like the\nbeginning of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed has to be read in a\nrestricted manner if it is to avoid asserting impossible propositions.\nAnd this seems the right way to go for the theistic Platonist. It is\nvery difficult to discern the scope of the universal quantifier in the\nusage of writers from nearly 2000 years ago. (This is apart from\nquestions about the connection between intention and semantic\ncontent.)\n\nVan Inwagen\u2019s main focus is on authoritative texts like the\nNiceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. But we noted earlier a second sort of\nreason for adopting a view on which any necessarily existing abstract\nobjects depend on God. That second sort of reason is perfect-being\ntheology. Again, the line of reasoning is that a being who is such\nthat necessarily existing abstracta depend on it is greater than a\nbeing on whom they don\u2019t depend. And God is the greatest\npossible being. It is clear what van Inwagen would say at this point:\nIt\u2019s not possible for necessarily existing abstract objects to\ndepend on anything. Thus, being an x such that necessarily\nexisting abstracta depend on x is not a great-making property.\nThat this isn\u2019t a great-making property is the sort of thing the\ntheistic Platonist needs to say to the perfect-being defender of\ndivine grounding of necessarily existing abstracta. It must be that\nthese things can\u2019t depend on God or anyone else. (One may or may\nnot adopt Inwagen\u2019s particular argument that they\ncan\u2019t.)\n\nThus, if the theistic Platonist thinks there are good arguments that\nnecessarily existing abstract objects can\u2019t be grounded in God,\nshe will have reason to do two things. First, she will have reason\nread the relevant universal quantifications in authoritative texts as\nrestricted. Second, if she accepts the sort of reasoning in perfect\nbeing theology; she will have reason to insist that being an x\nsuch that necessarily existing abstracta depend on x is not a\ngreat-making property (any more than being able to create a square\ncircle is).\n4.2 Theistic Nominalism\n\nThe theistic nominalist doesn\u2019t think there are necessarily\nexisting abstract objects. She may or may not think if there were\nnecessarily existing abstract objects, they would be grounded in God.\nFor instance, William Lane Craig (2016) who is a theistic nominalist;\nthinks that were there necessarily existing abstracta, they would have\nto be grounded in God. (We presumably should count Craig as someone who thinks there are true counterpossibles.) But one can imagine someone who thinks that if\nthings like numbers and properties did exist, theistic Platonism would\nbe a plausible view to adopt. It is worth noting that very\nfew\u2014if any\u2014of the realists about necessarily existing\nabstracta who are theists are themselves realists because\nthey are theists. Rather, they are realists about necessarily existing\nabstracta for other sorts of reasons (e.g.,\n indispensability arguments,\n arguments that we quantify over them with true sentences, or arguments that true sentences (e.g., that 2+3=5)\nrequire them as truthmakers (see Rodriguez-Pereyra (2005) for a\ndefense of truthmakers). Van Inwagen himself believes in necessarily\nexisting abstract objects because he thinks that we are committed to\ntrue existential quantifications over them (e.g., van Inwagen 2014:\nch. 8). There is nothing in particular the theistic nominalist needs\nto say qua theist about the existence of necessarily existing\nabstracta that any other\n nominalist\n doesn\u2019t need to say. One advantage of theistic nominalism is\nthat it allows one to avoid some of the sorts of difficult maneuvers\nthat those who believe God grounds the existence of necessarily\nexisting abstract objects wind up performing. Another advantage of\ntheistic nominalism is that it allows one, if she wishes, to avoid\ndebates about the semantics of universal quantifiers in ancient\nreligious texts. Of course, theistic nominalism is open only to those\nwho find plausible nominalistic replies to standard arguments for\nrealism about necessarily existing abstracta. Craig himself thinks\nthat he can give replies to these standard arguments for realism\n(2016: ch. 3, 6,\n 7).[12]\n\nWe turn now to two \u201cmixed views\u201d, views on which different\ntypes of abstracta stand in different grounding relations to God. Both\nof them try to bracket abstracta having to do with God (e.g.,\nGod\u2019s own attributes), and to say that God doesn\u2019t ground\nthose. But God grounds all the other necessarily existing\nabstracta.\n4.3 Mixed View 1: Mentalism-Platonism\n\nOn this view, propositions are identical with divine mental states;\nand properties and relations not exemplified by God are independent of\nGod, a la theistic Platonism. This is the view of Gould and Davis\n(2014). They say, \u201cThus, abstract objects exist in two realms:\nthe divine mind and Plato\u2019s heaven \u201d (2014: 61). They\ndecline to say in this particular essay whether mentalism or Platonism\nis true of other sorts of abstract objects (e.g., numbers, states of\naffairs, possible worlds). So what we have in Gould and Davis is an\ninitial sketch of a proposal. They are motivated by bootstrapping\nworries for theistic activism (itself an emanationist view). They\nthink that they can evade bootstrapping objections by having some\nabstracta be identical with divine mental states, and having the\nothers not grounded in God. Their own name for this view is\n\u201cmodified theistic activism\u201d.\n\nIt is perhaps strange that, having started with theistic activism (an\nemanationist view) and its bootstrapping worries, they wind up with a\npart-mentalist view. It would seem that they could have kept some\nabstracta causally grounded in God, and others independent of God (see\n Mixed View 2,\n below). Also, this first Mixed View will face objections of the sort\nfaced by theistic Platonism; viz. that it doesn\u2019t take divine\naseity seriously enough, and that it must read the quantifiers in the\nrelevant religious texts in a restricted manner. Furthermore, it is\npeculiar that propositions wind up as divine mental states, but\nproperties and relations wind up independent of God. One natural\nunderstanding of propositions is that they are structured entities,\nmade up of properties and relations. Another is that they are sets of\npossible worlds. The former understanding seems unavailable to Gould\nand Davis, and the latter would seem to involve having sui\ngeneris primitive possible worlds identical with divine mental\nstates. But at that point, why not just be a thoroughgoing theistic\nmentalist? After all, bootstrapping isn\u2019t a concern for the\nmentalist. Furthermore, bootstrapping worries arise with abstracta\nother than properties. For instance, consider the proposition God\nis omnipotent. In any possible world it exists, it is true. That\nis, it has being true as part of its essence. But\nthen, if God causes it to exist, God causes it to be true. So we have\nthe same sorts of bootstrapping concerns as we did with a property\nlike being omnipotent.\n4.4 Mixed View 2: Anti-Bootstrapping Emanationism\n\nThis is a view designed wholly to avoid bootstrapping worries that\naffect theistic emanationism. It really is a sort of modified\ntheistic activism, and it may actually be the sort of view Gould and\nDavis (2014) would like to hold. The idea is this: Ascertain the\nnecessarily existing abstracta that cause bootstrapping problems\n(e.g., being God, being omnipotent, etc.) for the\nemanationist. Those exist independently of God. All other necessarily\nexisting abstracta are causally grounded in God in the way the\ntheistic emanationist thinks abstracta are grounded in God. \n\nSo far as I can tell, no one holds this first mixed view. Perhaps the\nreader is thinking that that is because it is obviously ad\nhoc: The sole motivation for the two classes of abstracta in the\ntheory is avoidance of bootstrapping worries. This is too strong, I\nthink. There is a reason why certain abstracta create\nbootstrapping problem. That reason is that they have to do with God in\na way that other abstracta that don\u2019t cause bootstrapping\nproblems don\u2019t. So why not say that Leibniz or Menzel and Morris\nare right about all the non-God related abstracta? To put it another\nway, why not be an emanationist about all the abstracta one can be an\nemanationist about\u2014those that don\u2019t have to do with God?\n\n\nThat said, there is at least a whiff of ad-hocness here. The\nmotivation for this theory presumably would be that of perfect being\ntheology. For the proponent of this first mixed view must think that\nthe quantifiers in relevant religious texts are actually restricted.\nThey aren\u2019t as restricted as the theistic Platonist\nthinks they are. But she will agree with the theistic Platonist that\nit\u2019s false that all (read the quantifier wide open) entities are\ncreated by/depend on/grounded in God. It\u2019s worth pointing out\nthat it\u2019s not clear how to delineate precisely those abstracta\nthat lead to bootstrapping problems and those that don\u2019t. The\nbest one can do seems to be to say that those that cause bootstrapping\nproblems don\u2019t depend on God, and all others God causes to\nexist. But presumably for each necessarily existing abstract object,\neither it gives rise to bootstrapping problems, or it doesn\u2019t.\nSo there should be two non-overlapping classes of abstract objects at\nhand here, even if we\u2019re not able to specify more descriptively\nwhich abstracta are in which class.\n\nIt would be better if the emanationist could find a cogent reply to\nbootstrapping concerns. But if she can\u2019t, she may plump for\nbeing an emanationist about all abstracta save those having to do with\nGod.",
