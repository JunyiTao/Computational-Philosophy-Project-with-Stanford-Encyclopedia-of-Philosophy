    "main_text": "\n\nThe first major work in the history of philosophy to bear the title\n\u201cMetaphysics\u201d was the treatise by Aristotle that we have\ncome to know by that name. But Aristotle himself did not use that\ntitle or even describe his field of study as\n\u2018metaphysics\u2019; the name was evidently coined by the first\ncentury C.E. editor who assembled the treatise we know as\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics out of various smaller\nselections of Aristotle\u2019s works. The title\n\u2018metaphysics\u2019\u2014literally, \u2018after the\nPhysics\u2019\u2014very likely indicated the place the\ntopics discussed therein were intended to occupy in the philosophical\ncurriculum. They were to be studied after the treatises dealing with\nnature (ta phusika). In this entry, we discuss the ideas that\nare developed in Aristotle\u2019s treatise.\n\nReferences in the text to the books of Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics are given by Greek letter. In order (with the\ncorresponding Roman numeral given in parentheses) these are: \u0391\n(I), \u03b1 (II), \u0392 (III), \u0393 (IV), \u0394 (V), \u0395\n(VI), \u0396 (VII), \u0397 (VIII), \u0398 (IX), I (X), \u039a (XI),\n\u039b (XII), \u039c (XIII), \u039d (XIV). Translations are taken from\nReeve (2016).\n",
