    "main_text": "Early Developments to the 1320s || Exercised Act vs. Signified (or Conceived) Act\n2.3 Exercised Act vs. Signified (or Conceived) Act\n\nA third theory from this early period distinguishes the\n\u201cexercised\u201d act from the \u201csignified\u201d or\n\u201cconceived\u201d act. The details of this theory are not yet\nwell understood, but the basic strategy is to distinguish what the\nliar says he is doing (namely, lying) from what he really\nis doing. The author of the Questions on the Sophistical\nRefutations attributed to John Duns Scotus, who held a version of\nthis theory (Scotus [DS-Q], questions 52\u201353, pp. 505\u201315),\nthought that what the liar is really doing (the \u201cexercised\nact\u201d) is speaking the truth. In order to avoid the paradox, this\ntheory would seem to be committed to saying that the exercised act and\nthe signified act are two distinct acts, so that the theory,\nlike the theory of transcasus\n (Section 2.2\n above), is committed to some kind of restriction on\n self-reference.[16]\n",
