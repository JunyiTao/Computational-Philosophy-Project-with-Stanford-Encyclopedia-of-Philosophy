The existence-neutrality of existential NPs is\nclearly supported by (19), for there is nothing to prevent the\napplication at a world w of want to\n^(a(woollen(sweater))) from producing a function\nmapping Jack to TRUE even if, at the same w,\n(woollen(sweater)) maps every individual to FALSE\n(woollen sweaters don\u2019t exist).\n\nSubstitution-failure is supported for contingently coextensive\nexpressions. For instance, (19) does not entail\nwant(^(a(pringle(sweater))))(jack) even if there are\nworlds where all and only woollen sweaters are Pringle sweaters, so\nlong as there are other worlds where this is not so. Let u be a world\nof the latter sort. Then a(pringle(sweater)) at u and\na(woollen(sweater)) at u are different functions of\ntype (ib)b, making\n^(a(pringle(sweater))) and\n^(a(woollen(sweater))) different at every world.\nTherefore want(^(a(pringle(sweater)))) may map Jack\nto FALSE at worlds where want(^(a(woollen(sweater))))\nmaps Jack to TRUE: since want is applied to different\ninputs here, the outputs may also be different.\n\nBut this result depends on the fact that\n(pringle(sweater)) and\n(woollen(sweater)) are merely contingently\ncoextensive. If \u2018water\u2019 and \u2018H2O\u2019\nare necessarily co-extensive, then wanting a glass of water\nand wanting a glass of H2O will be indistinguishable in\nhigher-order intensional type theory. This failure to make a\ndistinction, however, traces to the intensionality of the semantics\n\u2014 to its being (merely) a possible-worlds semantics \u2014 not\nto its being higher-order or type-theoretic. So possible solutions\ninclude (i) augmenting higher-order intensional type theory with extra\napparatus, or (ii) employing a different kind of higher-order type\ntheory. In both cases the aim is to mark distinctions like that\nbetween wanting a glass of water and wanting a glass of\nH2O.\n\nA solution of the first kind, following (Carnap 1947), is proposed in\n(Lewis 1972:182\u20136); the idea is that the meaning of a complex\nexpression is not its intension, but rather a tree that exhibits the\nexpression\u2019s syntactic construction bottom-up, with each node in the\ntree decorated by an appropriate syntactic category label and semantic\nintension. But as Lewis says (p. 182), for non-compound lexical\nconstituents, sameness of intension implies sameness of meaning. So\nalthough his approach will handle the water/H2O problem if\nwe assume the term \u2018H2O\u2019 has structure that the\nterm \u2018water\u2019 lacks, it will not without such an\nassumption. For the same reason, it cannot explain\nsubstitution-failure involving unstructured proper names, on the usual\nview (deriving from Kripke 1972) that identity of extension (at any\nworld) for such names implies identity of intension. So we have no\naccount of why admiring Cicero isn\u2019t the same thing as admiring\nTully.\n\nA solution of the second kind, employing a different kind of\nhigher-order type theory, is pursued in (Thomason 1980). In Thomason\u2019s\n\u201cintentional\u201d logic, propositions are taken as a primitive\ncategory, instead of being analyzed as intensions of type sb.\nIn turns out that a somewhat familiar higher-order type theory can be\nbuilt on this basis, in which, roughly, the type of propositions plays\na role analogous to the type of truth-values in extensional type\ntheory. A property such as orator, for example, is a\nfunction of type ip (as opposed to ib), where\np is the type of propositions: given an individual as input,\norator will produce the proposition that that\nindividual is an orator as output. Proper names, however, are not\ntranslated as terms of type i, for then\ncicero and tully would present the\nsame input to orator, resulting in the same\nproposition as output: orator(cicero) =\norator(tully). So there would be no believing Cicero\nis an orator without believing Tully is an orator. Instead, Thomason\nassigns proper names the type (ip)p, functions from\nproperties to propositions. And merely the fact that Cicero and Tully\nare the same individual does not require us to say that\ncicero and tully must produce the\nsame propositional output given the same property input. Instead, we\ncan have cicero(orator) and\ntully(orator) distinct (see Muskens 2005 for further\ndevelopment of Thomason\u2019s approach).\n\nApplying this to intensional transitives is just a matter of assigning\nappropriate types so that the translations of, say, \u2018Lucia seeks\nCicero\u2019 and \u2018Lucia seeks Tully\u2019, are different\npropositions (potentially with different truth-values). We need to\nkeep the verb as function, and we already have the types of\ncicero and tully set to\n(ip)p. The translations of \u2018seeks\nCicero\u2019 and \u2018seeks Tully\u2019 should be functions\ncapable of accepting inputs of type (ip)p, such as\nlucia, and producing propositions as output.\nseeks therefore accepts input of type\n(ip)p and produces output that accepts input of type\n(ip)p and produces output of type p. Thus\nseeks is of type\n((ip)p)(((ip)p)p), and we\nget substitution-failure because seeks(cicero) and\nseeks(tully) can be different functions of type\n((ip)p)p so long as cicero\nand tully are different functions of type\n(ip)p (as we already said they should be).\nseeks(cicero) can therefore map\nlucia to one proposition while\nseeks(tully) maps it (not \u2018her\u2019) to\nanother; and these propositions can have different\n truth-values.[8]\n\nFinally, there is the question whether (19) shows that Montague\u2019s\nsemantics supports notional readings. One problem is that Montague\u2019s\nsemantics for extensional verbs such as \u2018get\u2019 is exactly\nthe same as for intensional verbs, and it takes an extra stipulation,\nor meaning-postulate, for \u2018get\u2019, to guarantee\nthat the extension of get(^(a(woollen(sweater)))) at\nw maps Jack to TRUE only if the extension of\n(woollen(sweater)) at w maps some individual to TRUE\n(you can want a golden fleece even if there aren\u2019t any, but you can\u2019t\nget one if there aren\u2019t any). So apparently (19)\u2019s pattern\nembodies something in common to the notional meaning of \u2018want a\nwoollen sweater\u2019 and the meaning of \u2018gets a woollen\nsweater\u2019, something which is neutral on the existence of woollen\nsweaters. This is unintuitive, but is perhaps not a serious problem,\nsince it can be avoided by a different treatment of extensional\ntransitives.\n\nA more pressing question is what justification we have for thinking\nthat (19) captures the notional, \u2018no particular one\u2019,\nreading of\n (18).[9]\n On the face of it, (19) imputes to Jack the wanting attitude towards\nthe property of being a property of a woollen sweater. This is the\nsame attitude as Jack may stand in to a particular woollen sweater,\nsay that one. But it is not at all clear that we have any\ngrasp of what a single attitude with such diverse objects could be,\nand the difficulty seems to lie mainly with the proposed semantics for\nnotional readings. What does it mean to have the attitude of desire\ntowards the property of being a property of a woollen sweater?\n\nTwo ways of dealing with this suggest themselves. First, we might\nsupplement the formal semantics with an elucidation of what it\nis to stand in a common-or-garden attitude to a property of\nproperties. Second, we might revise the analysis to eliminate this\ncounterintuitive aspect of it, but without importing the\npropositionalist\u2019s hidden sentential contexts.\n\nBoth (Moltmann 1997) and (Richard 2001) can be read as providing,\nwithin Montague\u2019s general approach, an account of what it is to stand\nin an attitude relation to a property of properties. Both accounts are\nmodal, having to do with the nature of possible situations in which\nthe attitude is in some sense \u201cmatched\u201d by the situation:\nan attitude-state of need or expectation is matched if the need or\nexpectation is met, an attitude-state of desire is matched if the\ndesire is satisfied, an attitude-event of seeking is met if the search\nconcludes successfully, and so on. According to Moltmann\u2019s account\n(1997, 22\u20133) one stands in the attitude relation of seeking to\n^(a(woollen(sweater))) iff, in every minimal\nsituation \u03c3 in which that search concludes successfully,\nyou find a woollen sweater in \u03c3. Richard (2001, p. 116) offers a\nmore complex analysis that is designed to handle negative quantified\nNPs as well (\u2018no woollen sweater\u2019, \u2018few woollen\nsweaters\u2019, etc.). On this account, a search \u03c0\ndemands ^(a(P)) iff for every relevant\nsuccess-story m = <w, s> for \u03c0, things in s with a\nproperty entailing P are in the extension of\n^(a(P)) at w. Here s is the set of things that are\nfound when the search concludes successfully in w.\n\nBy contrast, (Zimmerman 1993) and (Forbes 2000, 2006) propose\nrevisions in (19) itself and its ilk. Zimmerman (161\u20132) replaces\nthe quantifier intension with a property intension, since he holds\nthat (i) unspecific readings are restricted to \u201cbroadly\u201d\nexistential quantified NPs, and (ii) the property corresponding to\nthe nominal in the existential NP (e.g., \u2018woollen\nsweater\u2019) can do duty for the NP itself. Of course, the proposed\nrestriction of unspecific readings to existentials is controversial\n(cf. our earlier example, \u2018Guercino is looking for\nevery dog on Aldrovandi\u2019s estate\u2019). It may also be wondered\nwhether there is any less of a need to explain what it is to stand in\nthe seeking relation to a property of objects than to a property of\nproperties (but for a response to this kind of objection, see\nGrzankowski 2018, 146\u20139).\n\nAccording to (Forbes 2000) the need for such an explanation already\nthreatens the univocality of a verb such as \u2018look for\u2019 as\nit occurs in \u2018look for that woollen sweater\u2019 and\n\u2018look for some woollen sweater\u2019. Observing that search\nverbs are action verbs, Forbes applies Davidson\u2019s event semantics to\nthem (Davidson 1967). In this semantics, as developed in (Parsons\n1990), search verbs become predicates of events, and in relational\n(specific) readings, the object searched for is said to be in a\nthematic relation to the event, one denoted by \u2018for\u2019; thus\n\u2018some search e is for that woollen\nsweater\u2019. But in unspecific readings, no thematic relation is\ninvoked; rather, the quantified NP is used to characterize\nthe search. So we would have \u2018some search e is\ncharacterized by ^(a(woollen(sweater)))\u2019, i.e.,\ne is an a-woollen-sweater search (Forbes 2000, 174\u20136;\n2006, 77\u201384). What it is for a search to be characterized by a\nquantifier, say ^(a(woollen(sweater))), is explained\nin terms of \u2018outcome postulates\u2019. For the current example,\nas a first approximation, a search is characterized by\n^(a(woollen(sweater))) iff any course of events in\nwhich that search culminates successfully includes an event of finding\na woollen sweater whose agent is the agent of the search. Similar\npostulates can be given for, e.g., the meeting of expectations and the\nsatisfaction of desires: a state of desire is characterized by\n^(a(woollen(sweater))) iff any course of events in\nwhich that desire is satisfied includes an event of getting a woollen\nsweater whose recipient is the agent of the search (Forbes 2006,\n94\u2013129). \n\nThere is therefore a range of different non-propositionalist\napproaches to intensional transitives. As we already remarked, one\npossibility is that propositionalism is correct for some verbs and\nnon-propositionalism correct for others. However, there is also the\noption that non-propositionalism is correct for all. A\nnon-propositionalist who makes this claim will have to explain the\nphenomena illustrated in (7)\u2013(10), without introducing degrees\nof freedom that make it unintelligible that these phenomena do not\narise for all intensional transitives.\n",
