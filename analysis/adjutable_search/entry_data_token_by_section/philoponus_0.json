    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nPhiloponus\u2019 oeuvre comprises at least 40 treatises on diverse\nsubjects such as grammar, logic, mathematics, physics, psychology,\ncosmology, astronomy, theology and church politics; even medical\ntreatises have been attributed to him. A substantial part of his work\nhas come down to us, but some parts of it are known only indirectly\nthrough quotations or translations into Syriac or Arabic. Although\nhis fame rests predominantly on the fact that, even within some of his\ncommentaries on works of Aristotle, he initiated and in fact\nanticipated the eventual liberation of natural philosophy from the\nstraitjacket of Aristotelianism, his non-polemical commentaries on\nAristotle as well as his theological treatises have recently become more widely studied, translated, and appreciated.\n\n Philoponus\u2019 intellectual career began when he was a pupil of the\nNeoplatonic philosopher Ammonius, son of Hermias, who had been trained\nby Proclus at Athens and was head of the school at Alexandria. Some of\nPhiloponus\u2019 commentaries profess to be based on Ammonius\u2019 lectures, but\nothers give more room to Philoponus\u2019 own ideas. Eventually, he\ntransformed the usual format of commentary sympathetic to Aristotle\u2019s views into a discourse\nof open criticism. In the course of this critique, Philoponus examines and repudiates\nfundamental Aristotelian-Neoplatonic tenets, most prominently the\ndoctrine of the eternity of the world. His style of philosophical commentary, doggedly\ndisrespectful of authority, as well as the\nconclusions he drew, antagonized Philoponus\u2019 pagan colleagues.\nTheir fierce enmity may have compelled him to abandon his philosophical\ncareer in the 530s; Philoponus never succeeded his teacher\nAmmonius as head of the school. Apparently he altogether abandoned his philosophical career. In the second half of his life he devoted his considerable energy\nto the theological debates of his time. Ironically, the\northodox church condemned him posthumously as a heretic (in 680\u201381)\nbecause of his tritheistic interpretation of the trinitarian dogma.\nUnderstanding the contested concepts within this debate (i.e. those of person, nature,\nsubstance, and hupostasis) in strictly Aristotelian senses, Philoponus was\nperceived to be enunciating not a single god in three persons (Father, Son,\nand Spirit), but actually three separate divinities.\n\n Reading Philoponus as well as the writings of his tireless adversary\nSimplicius, one gets the impression that, in the 6th century CE, traditional\npagan learning had become desperately insular. The intense\nincompatibilities between Greek philosophy and Christian dogma are\nreadily visible on every level of Philoponus\u2019 work\nas he struggles to hold his faith accountable to reason. Although his\nmode of thinking betrays a strong Aristotelian influence, it also\ndisplays a certain doctrinal affinity to Plato stripped of the\naccretions of layers of Neoplatonic interpretation. The style of\nPhiloponus\u2019 writing is often circuitous and rarely entertaining,\ndisplaying at times an almost pedantic rigor of argument and\nexposition. Yet he complements this kind of discourse with a remarkable freedom of\nspirit that allows him to cast off the fetters of authority\nas a criterion of truth, be it philosophical or\ntheological. Philoponus\u2019 works were translated into Arabic, Latin\nand Syriac, and he influenced later thinkers such as Bonaventure,\nGersonides, Buridan, Oresme and Galileo.\n",
