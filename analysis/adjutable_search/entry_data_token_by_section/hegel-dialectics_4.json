    "main_text": "Is Hegel\u2019s dialectical method logical?\n5. Syntactic patterns and special terminology in Hegel\u2019s dialectics\n\nAlthough Hegel\u2019s dialectics is driven by syntax, semantics and\nconsiderations specific to the different subject matters\n (section 4\n above), several important syntactic patterns appear repeatedly\nthroughout his works. In many places, the dialectical process is\ndriven by a syntactic necessity that is really a kind of exhaustion:\nwhen the current strategy has been exhausted, the process is forced,\nnecessarily, to employ a new strategy. As we saw\n (section 2),\n once the strategy of treating Being and Nothing as separate concepts\nis exhausted, the dialectical process must, necessarily, adopt a\ndifferent strategy, namely, one that takes the two concepts together.\nThe concept of Becoming captures the first way in which Being and\nNothing are taken together. In the stages of Quantum through Number,\nthe concepts of One and Many take turns defining the whole quantity as\nwell as the quantitative bits inside that make it up: first, the One\nis the whole, while the Many are the bits; then the whole and the bits\nare all Ones; then the Many is the whole, while the bits are each a\nOne; and finally the whole and the bits are all a Many. We can picture\nthe development like this (cf. Maybee 2009, xviii\u2013xix):\n\n\n\nFigure 9\n\n\nSince One and Many have been exhausted, the next stage, Ratio, must,\nnecessarily, employ a different strategy to grasp the elements in\nplay. Just as Being-for-itself is a concept of universality for\nQuality and captures the character of a set of something-others in its\ncontent (see\n section 1),\n so Ratio (the whole rectangle with rounded corners) is a concept of\nuniversality for Quantity and captures the character of a set of\nquantities in its content (EL \u00a7105\u20136; cf. Maybee 2009,\nxviii\u2013xix, 95\u20137). In another version of syntactic\nnecessity driven by exhaustion, the dialectical development will take\naccount of every aspect or layer, so to speak, of a concept or\nform\u2014as we saw in the stages of Purpose outlined above, for\ninstance\n (section 2).\n Once all the aspects or layers of a concept or form have been taken\naccount of and so exhausted, the dialectical development must also,\nnecessarily, employ a different strategy in the next stage to grasp\nthe elements in play.\n\nIn a second, common syntactic pattern, the dialectical development\nleads to an endless, back-and-forth process\u2014a \u201cbad\u201d\n(EL-BD \u00a794) or \u201cspurious\u201d (EL-GSH \u00a794)\ninfinity\u2014between two concepts or forms. Hegel\u2019s dialectics\ncannot rest with spurious infinities. So long as the dialectical\nprocess is passing endlessly back and forth between two elements, it\nis never finished, and the concept or form in play cannot be\ndetermined. Spurious infinities must therefore be resolved or stopped,\nand they are always resolved by a higher-level, more universal\nconcept. In some cases, a new, higher-level concept is introduced that\nstops the spurious infinity by grasping the whole, back-and-forth\nprocess. Being-for-itself (cf.\n section 1),\n for instance, is introduced as a new, more universal concept that\nembraces\u2014and hence stops\u2014the whole, back-and-forth process\nbetween \u201csomething-others\u201d. However, if the back-and-forth\nprocess takes place between a concept and its own content\u2014in\nwhich case the concept already embraces the content\u2014then that\nembracing concept is redefined in a new way that grasps the whole,\nback-and-forth process. The new definition raises the embracing\nconcept to a higher level of universality\u2014as a totality (an\n\u201call\u201d) or as a complete and completed concept. Examples\nfrom logic include the redefinition of Appearance as the whole World\nof Appearance (EL \u00a7132; cf. SL-M 505\u20137, SL-dG 443\u20134),\nthe move in which the endless, back-and-forth process of Real\nPossibility redefines the Condition as a totality (EL \u00a7147; cf.\nSL-M 547, SL-dG 483), and the move in which a back-and-forth process\ncreated by finite Cognition and finite Willing redefines the\nSubjective Idea as Absolute Idea (EL \u00a7\u00a7234\u20135; cf. SL-M\n822\u20133, SL-dG 733\u20134).\n\nSome of the most famous terms in Hegel\u2019s works\u2014\u201cin\nitself [an sich]\u201d, \u201cfor itself [f\u00fcr\nsich]\u201d and \u201cin and for itself [an und f\u00fcr\nsich]\u201d\u2014capture other, common, syntactic patterns. A\nconcept or form is \u201cin itself\u201d when it has a determination\nthat it gets by being defined against its \u201cother\u201d\n(cf. Being-in-itself, EL \u00a791). A concept or form is \u201cfor\nitself\u201d when it is defined only in relation to its own content,\nso that, while it is technically defined in relation to an\n\u201cother\u201d, the \u201cother\u201d is not really an\n\u201cother\u201d for it. As a result, it is really defined only in\nrelation to itself. Unlike an \u201cin itself\u201d concept or form,\nthen, a \u201cfor itself\u201d concept or form seems to have its\ndefinition on its own, or does not need a genuine \u201cother\u201d\nto be defined (like other concepts or forms, however, \u201cfor\nitself\u201d concepts or forms turn out to be dialectical too, and\nhence push on to new concepts or forms). In the logic,\nBeing-for-itself (cf.\n section 1),\n which is defined by embracing the \u201csomething others\u201d in\nits content, is the first, \u201cfor itself\u201d concept or\nform.\n\nA concept or form is \u201cin and for itself\u201d when it is doubly\n\u201cfor itself\u201d, or \u201cfor itself\u201d not only in\nterms of content\u2014insofar as it embraces its\ncontent\u2014but also in terms of form or presentation,\ninsofar as it also has the activity of presenting its\ncontent. It is \u201cfor itself\u201d (embraces its content) for\nitself (through its own activity), or not only embraces its\ncontent (the \u201cfor itself\u201d of content) but also\npresents its content through its own activity (the \u201cfor\nitself\u201d of form). The second \u201cfor itself\u201d of form\nprovides the concept with a logical activity (i.e., presenting its\ncontent) and hence a definition that goes beyond\u2014and so is\nseparate from\u2014the definition that its content has. Since it has\na definition of its own that is separate from the definition of its\ncontent, it comes to be defined\u2014in the \u201cin itself\u201d\nsense\u2014against its content, which has become its\n\u201cother\u201d. Because this \u201cother\u201d is still its own\ncontent, however, the concept or form is both \u201cin itself\u201d\nbut also still \u201cfor itself\u201d at the same time, or is\n\u201cin and for itself\u201d (EL \u00a7\u00a7148\u20139; cf.\nMaybee 2009: 244\u20136). The \u201cin and for itself\u201d\nrelationship is the hallmark of a genuine Concept (EL \u00a7160), and\ncaptures the idea that a genuine concept is defined not only from the\nbottom up by its content, but also from the top down through its own\nactivity of presenting its content. The genuine concept of animal, for\ninstance, is not only defined by embracing its content (namely, all\nanimals) from the bottom up, but also has a definition of its own,\nseparate from that content, that leads it to determine (and so\npresent), from the top down, what counts as an animal.\n\nOther technical, syntactic terms include aufheben (\u201cto\nsublate\u201d), which we already saw\n (section 1),\n and \u201cabstract\u201d. To say that a concept or form is\n\u201cabstract\u201d is to say that it is only a partial definition.\nHegel describes the moment of understanding, for instance, as abstract\n(EL \u00a7\u00a779, 80) because it is a one-sided or restricted\ndefinition or determination\n (section 1).\n Conversely, a concept or form is \u201cconcrete\u201d in the most\nbasic sense when it has a content or definition that it gets from\nbeing built out of other concepts or forms. As we saw\n (section 2),\n Hegel regarded Becoming as the first concrete concept in the\nlogic.\n\nAlthough Hegel\u2019s writing and his use of technical terms can make\nhis philosophy notoriously difficult, his work can also be very\nrewarding. In spite of\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014the\ndifficulty, there are a surprising number of fresh ideas in his work\nthat have not yet been fully explored in philosophy. \n",
