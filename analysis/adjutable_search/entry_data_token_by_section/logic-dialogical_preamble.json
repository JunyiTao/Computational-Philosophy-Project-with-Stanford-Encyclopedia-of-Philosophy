    "main_text": "\n\nDialogical logic is a dialogue-based approach to logic and\nargumentation rooted in a research tradition that goes back to\ndialectics in Greek Antiquity, when problems were approached through\ndialogues in which opposing parties discussed a thesis through\nquestions and answers. The dialogical framework was first worked out\nin its modern form by Paul Lorenzen and Kuno Lorenz in the context of\nconstructive mathematics and logic, and inspired many\n\u201cdialogical logics\u201d that follow more or less the initial\nprogram, thus creating what can be called traditions in dialogical\nlogic. This entry focuses on the developments of dialogical logic in\nthe Lorenzen and Lorenz tradition, which developed in the 1990s and\n2000s into a fruitful framework for the study, comparison, and\ncombination of various non-classical systems, giving rise to what has\nbeen called dialogical pluralism. References to the other\ntraditions will nonetheless be provided.\n\nIn the Lorenzen and Lorenz tradition, dialogical logic uses concepts\nof both game and argumentation theory to provide a pragmatist approach\nto meaning and reasoning constituted during the interaction of two\nplayers arguing on a given thesis. The game rules allow these players\nto challenge the other\u2019s statements or defend their own\nstatements in such a way that one player wins and the other loses\nafter a finite number of moves. The meaning of the logical constants\nis provided by a set of interaction rules (the local rules) and the\ndialogical equivalent of a demonstration is a construction of plays\nthrough which it is shown that one player may win whatever the other\nplayer\u2019s moves may be (winning strategy). Thus, both the\ndialogical meaning of the logical constants and the dialogical\nconception of demonstration are constituted by interaction.\n",
