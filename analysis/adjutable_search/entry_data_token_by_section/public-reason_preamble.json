    "main_text": "\n\nPublic reason requires that the moral or political rules that regulate\nour common life be, in some sense, justifiable or acceptable to all\nthose persons over whom the rules purport to have authority. It is an\nidea with roots in the work of Hobbes, Kant, and Rousseau, and has\nbecome increasingly influential in contemporary moral and political\nphilosophy as a result of its development in the work of John Rawls,\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas, and Gerald Gaus, among others. Proponents of\npublic reason often present the idea as an implication of a particular\nconception of persons as free and equal. Each of us is free in the\nsense of not being naturally subject to any other person\u2019s moral\nor political authority, and we are equally situated with respect to\nthis freedom from the natural authority of others. How, then, can some\nmoral or political rules be rightly imposed on all of us, particularly\nif we assume deep and permanent disagreement amongst persons about\nmatters of value, morality, religion, and the good life? The answer,\nfor proponents of public reason, is that such rules can rightly be\nimposed on persons when the rules can be justified by appeal to ideas\nor arguments that those persons, at some level of idealization,\nendorse or accept. But public reason is not only a standard by which\nmoral or political rules can be assessed: it can also provide\nstandards for individual behavior. Because we make moral and political\ndemands of each other, if we are to comply with the ideal of public\nreason, we must refrain from advocating or supporting rules that\ncannot be justified to those on whom the rules would be imposed. We\nshould instead, some insist, only support those rules we sincerely\nbelieve can be justified by appeal to suitably shared or public\nconsiderations\u2014for example, widely endorsed political values\nsuch as freedom and equality\u2014and abstain from appealing to\nreligious arguments, or other controversial views over which\nreasonable people are assumed to disagree. In this way, public reason\ncan be presented as a standard for assessing rules, laws,\ninstitutions, and the behavior of individual citizens and public\nofficials.\n\nThis entry is structured around questions about the nature of public\nreason that continue to be the subject of sustained debate in the\nliterature. Section 1 considers competing positions regarding the\nunderlying rationale for public reason. Section 2 identifies different\nviews about the appropriate scope of public reason. Does it apply to\nall moral rules, only to political rules, or only to some sub-set of\npolitical rules? Section 3 considers the question of public\nreason\u2019s constituency: to whom must our rules be justifiable in\norder to be considered legitimate or authoritative? The next question,\nin section 4, concerns the content of public reason; in particular, to\nwhat extent is this content determined via a process of philosophical\nreflection as opposed to actual moral deliberation? Section 5\nconsiders the structure of public reason, with particular focus on\nwhether public reason requires some shared perspective or set of\nconsiderations, or whether it can be achieved without any common moral\nor political perspective. Section 6 addresses the site of public\nreason: where do its norms properly apply and when do they regulate\nindividual conduct? Section 7 identifies some of the most influential\nobjections that have been pressed against the idea of public reason,\nand Section 8 concludes with a brief survey of a few further\ntopics.\n",
