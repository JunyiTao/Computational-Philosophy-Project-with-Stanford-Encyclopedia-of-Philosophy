The explanatory question: How can consciousness exist?\n\n\nThe How question focuses on explanation rather than\ndescription. It asks us to explain the basic status of consciousness\nand its place in nature. Is it a fundamental feature of reality in its\nown right, or does its existence depend upon other nonconscious items,\nbe they physical, biological, neural or computational? And if the\nlatter, can we explain or understand how the relevant nonconscious\nitems could cause or realize consciousness? Put simply, can we explain\nhow to make something conscious out of things that are not\nconscious?\n",
