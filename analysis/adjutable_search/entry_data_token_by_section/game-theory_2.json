    "main_text": "Basic Elements and Assumptions of Game Theory || Games and Rationality\n2.2 Games and Rationality\n\nAll situations in which at least one agent can only act to maximize\nher utility through anticipating (either consciously, or just\nimplicitly in his behavior) the responses to her actions by one or\nmore other agents is called a game. Agents involved in games\nare referred to as players. If all agents have optimal\nactions regardless of what the others do, as in purely parametric\nsituations or conditions of monopoly or perfect competition (see\n Section 1\n above) we can model this without appeal to game theory; otherwise, we\nneed it.\n\nGame theorists assume that players have sets of capacities that are\ntypically referred to in the literature of economics as comprising\n\u2018rationality\u2019. Usually this is formulated by simple\nstatements such as \u2018it is assumed that players are\nrational\u2019. In literature critical of economics in general, or of\nthe importation of game theory into humanistic disciplines, this kind\nof rhetoric has increasingly become a magnet for attack. There is a\ndense and intricate web of connections associated with\n\u2018rationality\u2019 in the Western cultural tradition, and\nhistorically the word was often used to normatively marginalize\ncharacteristics as normal and important as emotion, femininity and\nempathy. Game theorists\u2019 use of the concept need not, and\ngenerally does not, implicate such ideology. For present purposes we\nwill use \u2018economic rationality\u2019 as a strictly technical,\nnot normative, term to refer to a narrow and specific set of\nrestrictions on preferences that are shared by von Neumann and\nMorgenstern\u2019s original version of game theory, and RPT.\nEconomists use a second, equally important (to them) concept of\nrationality when they are modeling markets, which they call\n\u2018rational expectations\u2019. In this phrase,\n\u2018rationality\u2019 refers not to restrictions on preferences\nbut to non-restrictions on information processing: rational\nexpectations are idealized beliefs that reflect statistically\naccurately weighted use of all information available to an agent. The\nreader should note that these two uses of one word within the same\ndiscipline are technically unconnected. Furthermore, original RPT has\nbeen specified over the years by several different sets of axioms for\ndifferent modeling purposes. Once we decide to treat rationality as a\ntechnical concept, each time we adjust the axioms we effectively\nmodify the concept. Consequently, in any discussion involving\neconomists and philosophers together, we can find ourselves in a\nsituation where different participants use the same word to refer to\nsomething different. For readers new to economics, game theory,\ndecision theory and the philosophy of action, this situation naturally\npresents a challenge.\n\nIn this article, \u2018economic rationality\u2019 will be used in\nthe technical sense shared within game theory, microeconomics and\nformal decision theory, as follows. An economically rational player is\none who can (i) assess outcomes, in the sense of rank-ordering them\nwith respect to their contributions to her welfare; (ii) calculate\npaths to outcomes, in the sense of recognizing which sequences of\nactions are probabilistically associated with which outcomes; and\n(iii) select actions from sets of alternatives (which we\u2019ll\ndescribe as \u2018choosing\u2019 actions) that yield her\nmost-preferred outcomes, given the actions of the other players. We\nmight summarize the intuition behind all this as follows: an entity is\nusefully modeled as an economically rational agent to the extent that\nit has alternatives, and chooses from amongst these in a way that is\nmotivated, at least more often than not, by what seems best for its\npurposes. For readers who are antecedently familiar with the work of\nthe philosopher Daniel Dennett, we could equate the idea of an\neconomically rational agent with the kind of entity Dennett\ncharacterizes as intentional, and then say that we can\nusefully predict an economically rational agent\u2019s behavior from\n\u2018the intentional stance\u2019. As will be discussed later, the\nintentional stance can be made precise for application to\nquantitatively specified choices by drawing, sometimes with special\nmodifications, on the subjective rationality axioms of\n Savage (1954)\n (Harrison and Ross forthcoming).\n\nEconomic rationality might in some cases be satisfied by internal\ncomputations performed by an agent, and she might or might not be\naware of computing or having computed its conditions and implications.\nIn other cases, economic rationality might simply be embodied in\nbehavioral dispositions built by natural, cultural or market\nselection. In particular, in calling an action \u2018chosen\u2019 we\nimply no necessary deliberation, conscious or otherwise. We mean\nmerely that the action was taken when an alternative action was\navailable, in some sense of \u2018available\u2019 normally\nestablished by the context of the particular analysis.\n(\u2018Available\u2019, as used by game theorists and economists,\nshould never be read as if it meant merely\n\u2018metaphysically\u2019 or \u2018logically\u2019 available; it\nis almost always pragmatic, contextual and revisable by more refined\nmodeling.)\n\nEach player in a game faces a choice among two or more possible\nstrategies. A strategy is a predetermined \u2018program of\nplay\u2019 that tells her what actions to take in response to\nevery possible strategy other players might use. The\nsignificance of the italicized phrase here will become clear when we\ntake up some sample games below.\n\nA crucial aspect of the specification of a game involves the\ninformation that players have when they choose strategies. The\nsimplest games (from the perspective of logical structure) are those\nin which agents have perfect information, meaning that at\nevery point where each agent\u2019s strategy tells her to take an\naction, she knows everything that has happened in the game up to that\npoint. A board-game of sequential moves in which both players watch\nall the action (and know the rules in common), such as chess, is an\ninstance of such a game. By contrast, the example of the\nbridge-crossing game from Section 1 above illustrates a game of\nimperfect information, since the fugitive must choose a\nbridge to cross without knowing the bridge at which the pursuer has\nchosen to wait, and the pursuer similarly makes her decision in\nignorance of the choices of her quarry. Since game theory is about\neconomically rational action given the strategically significant\nactions of others, it should not surprise you to be told that what\nagents in games believe, or fail to believe, about each others\u2019\nactions makes a considerable difference to the logic of our analyses,\nas we will see.\n",
