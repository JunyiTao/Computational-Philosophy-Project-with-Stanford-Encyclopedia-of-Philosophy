    "main_text": "Brief History\n1. Brief History\n\nWe will attempt only the briefest history of the topic, focusing on\nkey episodes rather than on a comprehensive survey.\n\nIt is difficult to find in the writings of Plato or Aristotle a clear\nendorsement of propositions in our sense. Plato\u2019s most\nchallenging discussions of falsehood, in Theaetetus\n(187c\u2013200d) and Sophist (260c\u2013264d), focus on the\npuzzle (well-known to Plato\u2019s contemporaries) of how false\nbelief could have an object at all. Thinking that Theaetetus flies\nwould seem to require thinking the non-existent flying Theaetetus.\nWere Plato a propositionalist, we might expect to find Socrates or the\nEleactic Stranger proposing that false belief certainly has an object,\ni.e., that there is something believed in a case of false\nbelief\u2014in fact, the same sort of thing as is believed in a case\nof true belief\u2014and that this object is the primary bearer of\ntruth-value. But it seems no such proposal is seriously considered. In\nboth dialogues, it is suggested that thought is a kind of inward\ndialogue carried on in the mind itself (Theaetetus\n189e\u2013190a and Sophist263e), and that judgment results\nwhen the two inward voices affirm the same thing. Plato is standardly\nunderstood as explaining false belief (doxa) in terms of the\nassertion of a false statement (logos). But it is far from\nclear that he takes the objects of belief to be statements rather than\nsimply the ordinary concrete objects (e.g., Theaetetus) and forms\n(e.g., flying) which the statement is about, and still less\nclear that he takes statements to be sharable between minds.\nStatements, for Plato, might simply be tokens of inner speech, as\nNuchelmans (1973, p. 21) suggests.\n\nAristotle expends great energy in investigating what in reality makes\ntrue statements true, but less investigating the nature of\ntruth-bearers themselves. In his most significant discussions of truth\nand falsehood, he seems not to take a clear stand on the question of\npropositions. In On Interpretation 1 16a, for instance,\nAristotle remarks that falsity and truth require combination and\nseparation, whether of names and verbs in speech, or of elements in\nthought. However, it is unclear whether the resulting combination of\nthought elements is anything other than a token thought, as opposed to\nsomething which is the content of the token thought and which could be\nthought by others, could be denied, asserted, etc.\n\nArguably, the first employment in the western philosophical tradition\nof the notion of proposition, in roughly our sense, is found in the\nwritings of the Stoics. In the third century B.C., Zeno and his\nfollowers, including Chrysippus especially, distinguished the material\naspects of words from that which is said, or lekta. Among\nlekta, they distinguished the complete from incomplete (or\ndeficient), the latter corresponding roughly to the meanings of\npredicates, the former to the meanings of sentences. Among complete\nlekta they included axiomata, or the meanings of\ndeclarative sentences. For the Stoics, only axiomata, and not\nthe words used to articulate them, were properly said to be true or\nfalse. Axiomata were therefore the proper subject matter of\nStoic logic.\n\nLekta posed a problem for Stoic materialism, according to\nwhich everything real is corporeal. For the Stoics, the real was\nlimited to that which can act or be acted upon, and therefore to the\nbodily. Lekta, however, were thought to be incorporeal.\nSeneca explains:\n\nFor instance, I see Cato walking; the sense of sight reveals this to\nme and the mind believes it. What I see is a material object and it is\nto a material object that I direct my eyes and my mind. Then I say\n\u2018Cato is walking\u2019. It is not a material object that I now\nstate, but a certain affirmation about him\u2026 (Epistulae morales,\n117, 13)\n\n\nThe notion of a proposition can also be found in the works of Medieval\nphilosophers, including especially Abelard (1079\u20131142) and his\nfollowers, but also among later scholastic philosophers in England,\nincluding Adam Wodeham (d. 1358) and Walter Burleigh\n(1275\u20131344).\n\nAbelard distinguishes between dicta or what is said and acts\nof assertion (or thinking), the former being the fundamental bearers\nof truth-value. While Abelard himself seems to have had little to say\nabout the nature or identity conditions of dicta, his\nsuccessors took up the subject with vigor (Nuchelmans 1973, pp.\n162\u20133). Are dicta particular acts of thinking, concrete\nevents or facts, or entities having the same sort of being as\nuniversals? Each of these views is considered and evaluated in the\ntreatise Ars Meliduna, of unknown authorship.\n\nA similar debate raged among the English scholastics in the fourteenth\ncentury. Against Ockham\u2019s nominalistic account, under which the\nobject of assent is a complex token mental sentence, Adam Wodeham, for\nexample, maintained that the object of assent is not any sort of\nmental entity, nor even a thing at all, properly speaking,\nnor of course a nothing but rather a being the case\n(see Wood 2003, and Nuchelmans 1996, IV for further discussion of\nWodeham and his contemporaries).\n\nOne complicating factor for the contemporary reader in examining\nMedieval (and later) work on the topic is that the term\n\u201cpropositio\u201d was standardly used, following Boethius, to\nrefer to sentences, mental as well as written or spoken (oratio\nverum falsumve significans, i.e., speech signifying what is true\nor false). Propositions in our sense were what was signified by these\npropositiones if they signified at\n all.[2]\n\nWhen we turn to the early modern period, it is not easy to find, at\nleast in the writings of major philosophers, an unabashed assertion of\nthe reality of propositions. Unsurprisingly, one looks in vain in the\nwritings of the British empiricists. As for Descartes, particular acts\nof judgments serve as the primary bearers of truth-value (although\nthere is considerable debate about the status of his eternal truths).\nLeibniz\u2019s cogitato possibilis have some of the\ncharacteristics of propositions. These possible thoughts seem\nto play the role of thought-contents and the fundamental bearers of\ntruth-value. However, it is a matter of debate whether they are\naccorded real ontological status.\n\nPropositionalists were by no means rare in the 19th century, Gottlob\nFrege being the best known example. The Czech philosopher and\nmathematician Bernard Bolzano also deserves special mention. In his\nWissenschaftslehre, or Theory of Science, published\nin 1837, he argued for the existence of what he called\n\u2018S\u00e4tze an sich,\u2019 or sentences in themselves,\nwhich he clearly distinguished from linguistic items or mental\nphenomena. They are the fundamental bearers of truth and falsity, and\nthe objects of the attitudes. It is the goal of every science,\nincluding mathematics, to state the fundamental true sentences in\nthemselves pertaining that subject matter. (This marks a clear\ndeparture from the psychologizing approaches of many of\nBolzano\u2019s contemporaries.) Like Frege after him, Bolzano\nconceived of propositions as complexes composed of wholly abstract\nmind-independent constituents (Vorstellungen an sich).\nBolzano\u2019s work has had a profound influence on Husserlian\nphenomenology and the development of modern logic.\n\nArguably, the three figures whose work has most shaped the framework\nfor contemporary Anglophone work on propositions are Gottlob Frege,\nG.E. Moore, and Bertrand Russell. We will give short summaries of\ntheir thought on the matter.\n\nIn 1892, Frege published his classic paper \u201cOn Sense and\nReference\u201d. This paper contains his first formulation of the\ndistinction between sense (Sinn) and reference\n(Bedeutung). Roughly speaking, the sense of an expression is\nthe mode of presentation of its referent, or the cognitive value of\nits referent. Expressions were said to express their senses.\nSentences, too, had both referents and senses, according to Frege. The\nreferent of a sentence is its truth-value. Its sense is a thought\n(Beaney 1997, p. 156), not a token thought, but a thought in the sense\nof a proposition: a sharable content. Thus, in Fregean jargon,\nmeaningful sentences express thoughts.\n\nFrege conceived of thoughts as structured complexes of senses. The\nthought expressed by \u2018The evening star is bright\u2019 consists\nof the sense of \u2018the evening star\u2019 and the sense of\n\u2018is bright\u2019. (It should be noted that this claim about\nstructure does not strictly follow from the fact that sense is\ncompositional, i.e., that the sense of a whole expression is fixed by\nthe senses of its constituent parts and their syntactic mode of\narrangement.) In his late masterpiece, \u201cThe Thought\u201d\n(1922), Frege is explicit about the nature of thoughts. They are not\npart of the outer realm, which consists of those entities perceivable\nby the senses. This Frege thinks is obvious. Nor are they part of the\ninner realm, which consists of ideas. Unlike ideas, thoughts do not\nrequire an owner (i.e., they exist even if not present in any mind),\nand can be present to more than one mind. A third realm must be\nrecognized, he tells us\u2014a realm of abstract eternal entities\nwhich we can grasp by virtue of our power of thinking.\nHowever, Frege is explicit that thoughts do act:\n\nThoughts are not wholly unactual but their actuality is quite\ndifferent from the actuality of things. And their action is brought\nabout by a performance of a thinker; without this they would be\ninactive, at least as far as we can see. And yet the thinker does not\ncreate them but must take them as they are. They can be true without\nbeing grasped by a thinker; and they are not wholly unactual even\nthen, at least if they could be grasped and so brought into\naction (Beaney 1997, p. 345).\n\n\nThis is perhaps the locus classicus for platonism in the\nmodern sense of that term, that is, for the doctrine that there exist\nmind-independent abstract entities.\n\nIn their early writings, Russell and Moore endorse propositionalism.\nIn his 1903 book The Principles of Mathematics, Russell\naffirms the existence of propositions, taking them to be complexes of\nordinary concrete objects (the referents of words) rather than of\nFregean senses (p. 47). Propositions so conceived are now standardly\ncalled Russellian, and propositions conceived as complexes of\nsenses or abstract entities are called Fregean. In his 1899\npaper, \u201cThe Nature of Judgment,\u201d Moore affirms the\nexistence of propositions, taking them to be broadly Fregean in nature\n(in particular as being complexes of mind-independent Platonic\nuniversals which he calls concepts).\n\nRussell and Moore later grow suspicious of propositions (although\nRussell seems to have accepted them later as a kind of derived or\nimmanent entity). Interestingly, Moore\u2019s thinking on the matter\nseems to have changed dramatically during the winter of 1910\u201311,\nas his published lectures Some Main Problems of Philosophy\nreveal. Before Christmas, Moore claims:\n\nIn the one case what is apprehended is the meaning of the\nwords: Twice two are four; in the other case what is\napprehended is the meaning of the words: Twice four are eight\u2026\nNow by a proposition, I mean the sort of thing which is\napprehended in these two cases\u2026. I hope it is plain\nthat there certainly are such things as propositions in this sense.\n(p. 73)\n\n\nAfter Christmas, Moore is more skeptical. While the theory of\npropositions is admittedly simple and natural (p. 286), there are good\nreasons to reject it. He specifies two problems, both having to do\nwith facts, a topic he avoided in his earlier lectures. The\nfirst is that the theory of propositions suggests the\n\u201cprimitivist\u201d theory of truth, previously held by Moore\nand also Russell, according to which truth is a simple unanalyzable\nproperty of propositions. Primitivism, Moore now claims, requires the\nclaim that facts consist in the possession by a proposition of the\nsimple property of truth. This Moore now finds unacceptable. The\nsecond problem is simply that the theory seems intuitively false:\n\n\u2026if you consider what happens when a man entertains a false\nbelief, it doesn\u2019t seem as if his belief consisted merely in his\nhaving a relation to some object which certainly is. It seems\nrather as if the thing he was believing, the object of his\nbelief, were just the fact which certainly is\nnot\u2014which certainly is not, because the belief is\nfalse. (p. 287)\n\n\nRussell echoes similar sentiments in essays after Principles.\nIn 1910 he writes that \u201cwe feel that there could be no falsehood\nif there were no minds to make mistakes\u201d (Slater 1992, p. 119),\nand in the 1918 he remarks that a person with \u201ca vivid instinct\nas to what is real\u201d cannot \u201csuppose that there is a whole\nset of false propositions about \u201d [Russell 1956, p. 223).\n\nThese doubts led Russell (1912) to propose a multiple relation theory\nof judgment, to replace the standard two-place relational theory\n(which is discussed at length in section 3.1). To use Russell\u2019s\nexample, in judging that Desdemona loves Cassio, Othello stands, not\nin a binary relation to a proposition, but rather in a multiple or\nmany-placed relation to Desdemona, loving, and Cassio. Othello\u2019s\njudgment is true when there is a fact of Desdemona loving Cassio and\notherwise false. This theory, and its contemporary incarnations, is\ndiscussed in a supplementary document.\n\nMoore\u2019s doubts led him to postulate what appear to be merely\npossible facts as the objects of the propositional attitudes. When a\nsubject believes that x is F and x is not F, the object of belief is\nthe non-existent but possible fact that x is F. See section 9 below\nfor further discussion of possible facts and their relations to\npropositions.\n",
