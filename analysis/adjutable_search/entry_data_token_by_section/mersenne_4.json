    "main_text": "Metaphysical Issues || Voluntarism\n3.3 Voluntarism\n\nVoluntarism was an important feature in Mersenne\u2019s apologetics.\nAgainst what appeared to him dangerous necessitarian tendencies in\nRenaissance naturalist philosophies, he repeatedly advocated\nGod\u2019s essential freedom in regard His creation. God chooses to\nexert his efficient, transitive causality in whatever way he will.\nThis for instance explains why Mersenne always opposed the idea of an\ninfinite universe. An infinite world, of the kind postulated by\nGiordano Bruno, would be very close to a necessary emanation of God,\nbut it is neither required of God\u2019s infinite power, nor does it\nagree with the nature of a created thing :\n\n\nall that is produced is finite but God\u2019s potentia is without\nmeasure. No created object is adequate to it. (QG: col. 435)\n\n\nMersenne maintained that God is not constrained by His infinite power.\nAs a free cause, he can chose to create a finite universe:\n\n\nwhy would God make a finite world, if He could make an infinite one?\nThe answer is: God did not want to do anything else than what he\ndid\u2014this however will not prevent us from believing He is all\npowerful, as we distinguish in God the work and the will [le faire\net le vouloir]\u2026 it is bad reasoning to conclude an\ninfinite effect from an infinite cause when the cause is not acting\nnecessarily but freely. (ID II: 304)\n\n\nFor Mersenne the unique perfect egalitarian emanation of God would be\nan action ad intra, that is the action through which God\ncontemplates (and loves) Himself in the persons of the trinity. When\none comes to causality ad extra, such as creation, one has to\ndistinguish (ID II: 311\u20132) between divine power and divine will.\nThe first contains and addresses infinite possibilities, the second\nchooses, from among them, a finite assortment.\n\nVoluntarism concerning the nature and laws of creation may appear as\nan important common ground that Mersenne shared with orthodox\n(Thomist) scholasticism, and with Descartes. As Lenoble has shown, its\nassertion was an essential precondition for the establishment of a\nmechanical science, unifying the whole of nature under the contingent\nwill of God, his initial decisions regarding the distribution and laws\nof matter and motion. Mersenne\u2019s voluntarism implies that\nphysics is not about an eternal and immutable object, as God could\nhave ordered the word in various manners and with various laws. This,\nas we shall see, has important epistemological consequences:\nGod\u2019s freedom means that he is not compelled to create things in\nthe simplest fashion. This is evidenced in the reign of the grace,\nwhere one can clearly see that God did not chose the shortest way to\ndispense his grace, as he could have assured our salvation with a\nunique act of his will (cf. Questions Inou\u00efes, p.\n344\u20135] But this hold as well for scientific truths, and explains\nfor example why Mersenne never considered as decisive Galilean and\nCopernican arguments for the motion of the earth taken from the\nsimplicity of natural order. Mersenne\u2019s point was actually quite\nclose to the argument from divine omnipotence that Pope Urban VIII\nsuggested to Galileo in 1623, and that Galileo, somewhat ironically,\nput in the mouth of Simplicio in the concluding sentences of the 1632\nDialogo: Man cannot presume to know how the world really is,\nsince God could have brought about the same effects in ways unimagined\nby humans (see Galileo, 1890\u20131909, VII, 488).\n",
