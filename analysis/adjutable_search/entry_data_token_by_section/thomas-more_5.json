Socratic Dialogue on Philosophy and the City: Utopia\n\nUtopia, undoubtedly More\u2019s most famous and most\ncontroversial dialogue, combines elements from the dialogue forms of\nPlato and Cicero, with dozens of allusions to each author, starting\nwith the very title:\n\n\nDE OPTIMO REIPUBLICAE STATU DEQUE, nova insula UTOPIA libellus\nvere aureus nec minus salutaris quam festivus, clarissimi\ndisertissimique viri THOMAE MORI inclutae civitatis Londinensis civis\net Vicecomitis\n\n(first published in English in 1551 as On the Best State of a\nCommonwealth and on the new Island of Utopia A Truly Golden Handbook,\nNo Less Beneficial than Entertaining by the Most Distinguished and\nEloquent Author Thomas More Citizen and Undersheriff of the Famous\nCity of London).\n\n\nIt was Cicero who translated Plato\u2019s title Politeia as\nRes Publicae and who established, in his own\nRepublic and Laws, the conversation with Plato that\nMore continues in Utopia. More, however, adds comic elements\nfrom Lucian\u2019s dialogues, and to miss the humor in\nUtopia is to miss his characteristic comic irony.\n\nBook 1 of Utopia raises the large question of\nphilosophy\u2019s relation to the city. Raphael Hythloday argues that\nphilosophy will never have a place in any city unless that city\nimitates Utopia. The character \u201cThomas Morus\u201d maintains an\nopposing view: that a philosophy \u201cmore civil [civilior]\nthan Hythloday\u2019s \u201cacademic [scholasticae]\u201d\nphilosophy not only has a place, but even poses a challenge and a duty\nnot to desert \u201cthe ship in a storm because you cannot control\nthe winds\u201d\u2014while making things \u201cas little bad as you\ncan\u201d (EW 172.19\u201327). This debate goes back to\nPlato and Cicero; More continues it, but adds many issues raised by\nbiblical revelation and by Church Fathers, especially Augustine\n(Wegemer 1996: 128\u201349).\n\nBecause Hythloday does not convince Morus and his friend Peter Giles\nby the end of Book 1, Morus invites both him and Giles to lunch,\nurging Raphael to tell all he can about Utopia, especially everything\nthat it can teach about educating citizens well, so that they become\ncapable of self-rule (EW 158.82\u201383, 159.2\u20133).\nBook 2 of Utopia follows, an afternoon-long monologue by\nHythloday, who presents a highly selective description of life in\nUtopia. Afterwards, Morus observes that Hythloday is tired and not in\nthe mood to be questioned, so he invites Hythloday and Giles to\ndinner, complimenting Raphael on his story-telling and saying that\nthey will have to find another time for a deeper investigation.\nUtopia ends with Morus commenting to the reader that\n\u201cquite a few of the institutions\u201d of Utopia were\n\u201cquite absurd\u201d (EW 211.18). In a letter written a\nyear later and included at the end of the 1517 edition of\nUtopia, Morus recommended that future readers ask questions\nin order to \u201cferret \u2026 out\u201d the truth of what\nHythloday had said (EW 215.85).\n\nThe setting and many plot details of Utopia provide\nthought-provoking contrasts to both Plato\u2019s Republic\nand Cicero\u2019s. For example, Plato\u2019s Republic\nbegins as Socrates is walking (with Glaucon) away from the Piraeus (a\nport six miles from Athens), having attended the new festival for a\nforeign goddess. On his way to Athens, he is accosted by Polemarchus\nand his friends, who \u201cforce\u201d him to speak about\njustice\u2014and though promised dinner, Socrates and his\ninterlocutors by the end of their long dialogue have not yet dined.\nUtopia begins with Morus leaving a church in the middle of\nAntwerp, and this busy public official welcomes Giles and Hythloday to\nthe garden of his home where he treats them to lunch and then dinner.\nCicero\u2019s Republic, like Utopia, also takes\nplace in the garden of a busy public official\u2014Scipio\nAemilianus\u2014in the middle of Rome. Given the dramatic character\nof classical dialogues, these comparisons of settings are an important\npart of Utopia\u2019s literary and philosophic design, as\nDominic Baker-Smith has indicated (1991 [2000: 94]).\n\nThe dialectical challenge posed by the conversation between Hythloday\nand Morus is playfully but seriously seen even in the names chosen, as\nMorus himself says at EW 215.50\u201361: Utopia is\nGreek for \u201cno place\u201d, and other Greek names negate what\nthey express: the river Anyder means \u201cno water\u201d;\nthe ruler ademos means \u201cno people\u201d. This kind of\nintellectual play is also seen in Utopia\u2019s more than\n140 uses of litotes \u201cin which a thing is affirmed by stating the\nnegative of its opposite\u201d (E. McCutcheon 1971: 107). This\ndialectical game-playing is especially pointed in the oxymoron that is\nformed by Hythloday\u2019s full name: Raphael is Hebrew for\n\u201chealer from God\u201d, and Hythloday is Greek for\n\u201cspeaker of nonsense\u201d\u2014but if so, which is he really,\nand when? And since morus is Greek for \u201cfool\u201d,\nwhat are we to make of one fool talking to another?\n\nThese kinds of playful puzzles fill the Utopia, requiring the\nreader\u2019s constant attention and probing engagement in light of a\nlong and complex philosophic tradition. These competing elements are\nseen most clearly in the core debate occupying the middle of Book 2\nabout the central Utopian philosophic controversy regarding the nature\nof virtue. Utopia\u2019s philosophic position is a strange mixture of\nan Epicurean emphasis on pleasure and the Stoic definition of virtue,\nwhile alluding throughout to Cicero\u2019s criticisms of both\npositions as well as to elements characteristic of\nChristianity\u2019s distinctive perspectives.\n\nAlthough the scholarship on Utopia far surpasses any other of\nMore\u2019s works, no consensus has emerged regarding the intricate\nintellectual puzzle More has created.\n",
