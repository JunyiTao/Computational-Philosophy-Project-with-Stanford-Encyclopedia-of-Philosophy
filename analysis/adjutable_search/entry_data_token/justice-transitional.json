Introduction to Transitional Justice\n The term \u201cTransitional Justice\u201d has come, in recent\nyears, to designate a field of academic inquiry, as well as political\npractice, concerned with the aftermath of conflict and large-scale\nhuman rights abuses. Theorists and practitioners of transitional\njustice focus on the most effective and legitimate ways of addressing\npast wrongs and moving towards the (re)establishment of a decent civil\norder. In this introduction, I describe the political and moral goals\nofficials tend to pursue in transitional settings and map out some of\nthe tensions between these goals. I argue that such strains are the\nresult of an endemic friction between the demands of stability and\njustice after war (the introduction draws on Eisikovits 2013).\n1.1 The Contradictions of Transitional Justice\n\n\nIn making the transition from a violent past into settled, legitimate\ngovernance, officials typically pursue multiple goals. While some of\nthese are mutually reinforcing, others come into conflict with each\nother. As a result it is difficult to fully pursue all transitional\ngoals at the same time. In what follows I describe the most important\ntransitional goals and elaborate about the relationships between\nthem.\n\nCreating a reliable record of past human rights\nabuses. Such a record is obviously important, for its own sake,\nas part of the very human project of keeping our history as accurately\nas\n possible.[3]\n It\nis also helpful in rebuffing spurious revisionist claims (thus, for\nexample, the record created by the Nuremberg trials has been helpful\nin rejecting the claims of various Holocaust deniers) and, more\nbroadly, in ending the displays of impunity so typical of\nauthoritarian governments. Once such a record is established it\nbecomes impossible for those who colluded with an oppressive regime to\ndeny responsibility and involvement in past\n crimes.[4]\n Perhaps most\nimportantly, the creation of an accurate, comprehensive, and public\nhistorical record matters for the psychological healing of victims who\nreport, time and again, benefitting from official and public\nacknowledgement of their suffering (see, e.g., Minow 2000).\n\nSetting up a functional, professional bureaucracy and civil\nservice, to efficiently serve the needs of the population. As\nwith the cementing of the rule of law, part of the idea is to\nestablish (or reestablish) citizens' trust in their government; once\nbasic services are rendered in a reliable, non-arbitrary, fashion\nordinary citizens may gain (or regain) the belief that government's\njob is to serve rather than oppress them.\nHelping victims restructure and repair their lives, by\nattending to their physical and psychological afflictions, restituting\nlost property, compensating them for their losses, and fixing\nhistorical injustices that systematically disadvantaged them. Needless\nto say, this project overlaps with the second and third goals; after\nall, to address the psychological distress of victims it is helpful to\npunish those who hurt them and to provide respectful forums in which\nthe stories of such victims can be heard.\nStopping violence and consolidating stability, so as to\nallow the creation of a normal civic and commercial life, cement trust\nin government, and draw outside investments.\n\n While all of these goals are politically important, it is easy to\nsee how they can come into conflict. Prosecuting the guilty can harm\npolitical stability, as the prosecuted and their (often armed)\nfollowers become resentful about what they perceive as a politically\nmotivated witch-hunt. Post-war prosecutions may also come into\nconflict with the need to cement the rule of law, as such prosecutions\noften require departures from the rules of procedural justice. Such\nwas the case with the retroactive criminalization that lay at the\nheart of the Nuremberg Trials. The doctrine of \u201cCommand\nResponsibility\u201d first developed at Nuremberg and used later by\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia also departs from\nbasic principles of legalism, by basing convictions on the status of\ndefendants rather than on direct and specific evidence concerning\ntheir actions (on this, see Drumbl 2005).\n\n\nEven when prosecutions do not threaten political stability and manage\nto stay true to the principles of the rule of law, they can still come\ninto conflict with the desire to create a robust, comprehensive\nhistorical record. When trials are used as the primary mechanism of\ntransitional justice, their very subjection to the rules of evidence\nmeans that some important information (namely testimony that does not\npertain to specific indictments, or evidence obtained without full due\nprocess etc.) will be excluded from the record. This limitation has\nprompted some scholars to argue that truth commissions are preferable\nto war crime trials in this respect: since such commissions are not\nsubject to the rules of evidence, they are able to collect more\ninformation, expose a more comprehensive picture of past injustices\nand to include a greater emphasis on the role of institutional and\ncommercial actors indirectly involved in\n supporting\ninjustices.[5]\n\n\n\nThe need to provide victims with meaningful, respectful public forums\nin which they can tell their stories and receive a degree of\nacknowledgment, central to the fifth aim, also comes into conflict\nwith some of the basic commitments of legalism. Criminal trials\nusually focus on the interests of the defendants. A respectable\ncriminal trial cannot be a platform for victims to tell their stories\nin an uninterrupted fashion. Since the testimony of victims is\ninstrumental for proving indictments, it is most often subject to\ninterruptions and vigorous cross-examination. As a result, a typical\ncriminal procedure can be quite an adversarial experience for\nvictims. This is true in spite of a recent expansion of the role of\nvictims in international criminal law. In fact, an undue expansion of\nthat role creates the grounds for criticizing international criminal\nlaw for abandoning some of its legalist underpinnings (see, for\nexample, Rauschenbach and Scalia 2008).\n\nFinally, the need to set up a functioning bureaucracy, so important\nfor the creation of public trust and the restoration of political\nnormalcy, can clash with the desire for accountability inherent in the\nfirst two goals. When most officials implicated in past crimes are\npurged or \u201clustrated\u201d, few competent administrators remain\nto do the work of government. Such a competence gap may, in turn,\nundermine political stability, economic viability, and public\ntrust\u2014all crucial factors in a successful transition. Indeed,\nworries about the tradeoff between accountability and the\nfunctionality of government have led many polities to either hedge or\ngive up their lustration policies\n mid-stream.[6]\n\n\n\nAlmost every transition since World War II displays these tensions.\nThe Nuremberg trials, often viewed as the pinnacle of legalism, were,\nnevertheless, based on ex post facto charges (see Bass 2002:\nCh. 5).  The Spanish transition to democracy was so fragile that it\nhad to commit itself to a \u201cpact of forgetting\u201d\u2014more\nthan three decades of silence about abuses committed during the civil\nwar and under Franco. Historical justice and the need to preserve the\npeace came into conflict, with the latter receiving precedence until\nthe 2008 Law of Historical Memory reversed the trend (see Tremlett\n2006).  In South Africa, de Klerk's National Party threatened civil\nwar if the African National Congress insisted on war crime trials\nagainst apartheid officials. The celebrated Truth and Reconciliation\nCommission, with its amnesty-for-truth arrangement, was the resulting\npolitical compromise meant to avoid both punishment and impunity. The\nANC's demand for retributive justice went unheeded (to the outrage of\nmany, including the family of Stephen Biko, who unsuccessfully sued\nthe Truth Commission in the South African Constitutional Court)\nbecause heeding it would have eliminated the chance for a democratic\nSouth Africa (for an overview see Meredith 1999).  The International\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda, operating in Tanzania, netted some of\nthe Genocide's ringleaders. But Rwanda was not able to apply rigorous\ncriminal responsibility to all those who participated in the murders.\nDoing so would have taken several centuries. Thus a system of\ntraditional justice, Gacaca, was devised. These makeshift\n\u201cGrass Courts\u201d failed to live up to western standards of\nlegalism (the judges were not professionals, rules of evidence were\nnot followed) and it failed to produce satisfying punishments. But it\ndid provide a platform from which at least some of the crimes were\nadmitted and acknowledged, and it did manage to empty the Rwandan\njails which contained hundred of thousands of prisoners. In the\ntension between practical functionality and retributive justice,\nRwanda nodded to the latter, but eventually focused on the former.\nThe policy of de-Baathification carried out negligently in the\naftermath of the second Gulf War, combined with the thoughtless\ndisbanding of the Iraqi army ended up fueling the anti-American\ninsurgency there, in addition to draining Iraq of many of those who\nhad crucial administrate skills and experience. Here too, the\ncommitment to retribution and the desire to create trust by\n\u201ccleaning out\u201d those associated with the previous regime\nactually ended up bringing about the opposite effects by further\ndestabilizing the country and harming its bureaucratic competence at a\nvery sensitive time (see Pfiffner 2010).\n1.2 Peace versus Justice\n\n\nPost war transitions are characterized by the co-existence of\npotentially conflicting, yet politically and morally important,\ngoals. As we have seen, some of these are about doing justice for past\nabuses, while others are concerned with consolidating stability and\ncreating functioning, competent institutions. The uneasy co-existence\nof these aims - the fact that they are all dearly held, and yet cannot\nquite be fully realized together\u2014points to a significant tension\nbetween considerations of justice and social utility after\nwar. Needless to say, this tension exists in ordinary political life\nas well. The friction between what is morally called for and the way\nin which leaders must sometimes act for the overall benefit of their\nsubjects has always been important to our understanding of\npolitics. Machiavelli articulates it most famously when he argues that\na Prince might have to learn how \u201cnot to be good\u201d in order\nto act in the best interest of his polity (Machiavelli, The\nPrince, Ch. 15).  Sartre provides the dramatic depiction and\ngives the problem its most familiar name in his play Dirty Hands. One\nof his protagonists puts it starkly: \u201cWell, I have dirty\nhands. Right up to the elbows. I've plunged them in filth and\nblood. But what do you hope? Do you think you can govern\ninnocently?\u201d (Sartre, \u201cDirty Hands,\u201d Act V).  The\nmost important contemporary philosophical treatment appears, of\ncourse, in Michael Walzer's famous article \u201cPolitical Action:\nThe Problem of Dirty Hands\u201d (Walzer 1973).  In transitional\ncontexts this tension is usually labeled the \u201cpeace versus\njustice\u201d dilemma (see, for example, Freeman 2010 and Mihai\n2010)\u2014denoting that the demands of quiet and stability may well\nrequire compromising the morally important demands of retributive\njustice and accountability. Thus, for example, it was wrong to allow\napartheid murderers to get away with murder during South Africa's\ntransition. But if they had been tried as war criminals, South Africa\nwould have most likely erupted into civil war. Similarly, it was wrong\nto bury Spain's history of violence for more than thirty years after\nthe end of Franco's dictatorship. But, had this history been excavated\nearlier, Spain may well have failed to develop into the liberal\ndemocracy it is today.\n Viewing the peace vs. justice dilemma as a variation of the\nproblem of dirty hands helps us better understand the nature of the\ntensions at play after war. Properly described, peace vs. justice is\nnot a debate between proponents of a Kantian commitment to full\nretributive justice and cynical realists who are willing, in the\ninfamous words of the Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, to \u201cdig\na hole and bury the past\u201d (quoted in Mydans 2010).  Rather, the\ntension is more properly viewed, like the problem of dirty hands, as a\nparadox: officials as well as citizens in transitional countries\nconcurrently hold two powerful yet often contradictory moral\nintuitions: that in order to establish a legitimate, functioning civil\nsociety one must do justice for the crimes of the past and that to\nsecure quiet, stability and a functioning government it is sometimes\nnecessary and morally acceptable to leave past crimes and past\ncriminals alone. An analogy to another such paradox may be helpful in\nillustrating the difference between a paradox and a debate. The\nproblem of moral luck famously delineated by Thomas Nagel and Bernard\nWilliams denotes a paradox about how we make judgments about praise\nand blame: we tend to think that people should be praised or blamed\nonly on the basis of what they can control, and yet we regularly\npraise and blame people on the basis of the results of their\nactions\u2014even if these are beyond the control of the agents\ninvolved (Nagel 1979 and Williams 1981). A drunk driver who got home\nsafely and a drunk driver who hit a child on the way home took the\nsame risk getting into their cars. The first intuition would require\ntreating them similarly.  The second recommends more severe punishment\nto the driver actually involved in an accident.\n\n\nA moral debate can, in principle, be settled by a superior set of\narguments. A paradox can only be described. Caught in the paradox\nbetween peace and justice we might end up emphasizing one kind of\nintuition over the other after war. But this is not the same as\nwinning a moral argument and doing away with a discredited\nposition. The Spaniards emphasized the need for stability over the\nneed for accountability for a period of thirty years. Then, when they\nwere confident enough that stability had been consolidated, they\nshifted their emphasis. The Rwandans, after conducting nominal\ncriminal trials in Tanzania, made a similar decision and cleared the\ndockets by means of their Gacaca courts. Rwanda is now more\nquiet and stable.  But such quiet, as commentators like Philip\nGourevitch have noted (see, most recently, Gourevitch 2009), is an\nuneasy one as long as survivors are resentful about failure to bring\nperpetrators to justice. Stated differently, there is no real\n\u201cdebate\u201d between peace and justice after war, as some\nscholars and NGOs claim, only a continuing negotiation that, at any\ngiven point, will lean towards one of these intuitions. The best we\ncan do is understand their co-equal status, settle on a policy that\nlies on the continuum between them, and constantly reevaluate.\n\nIn spite of the fact that the peace versus justice tension is merely a\nspecific manifestation of the problem of dirty hands, there is an\nimportant distinction that must be observed: while the tension between\njustice and social utility is part of the political life of any\nconsolidated democracy, it is central and definitive of political life\nduring transitions. In consolidated democracies, such tensions can be\nalleviated by legal institutions and traditions that embody\nconclusions about how to manage the requisite tradeoffs between\njustice and social utility (these include a constitution, a body of\naccepted constitutional jurisprudence, a respected high court with\npowers of judicial review, etc.). Part of the role of such\ninstitutions and traditions is to provide guidance about which\ntradeoffs would seem most justifiable given a comprehensive\ninterpretation of the state's legal and political history. But\ntransitional times are exactly the periods in which such institutions,\ntraditions, and interpretive principles are first being set out. When\nthe argument arose about abuses of executive power in the Unites\nStates following the September 11, 2001 attacks, that debate could\ntake place on the background of a history of executive power grabs and\nthe responses to them (Jefferson's requisitioning of funds for the\nmilitary without congressional approval and Lincoln's suspension of\nhabeas corpus during the civil war come to mind). In a\ntransitional context, that long and important political discussion is\nmissing.  More precisely, the very point of the transitional period is\nto set up the institutions and methods responsible for having that\ndebate. The upshot of this predicament is two fold: it is harder for\ntransitional societies to resolve peace versus justice decisions\nbecause the traditions and institutions so important for navigating\nthese questions are not yet present. At the same time, the very act of\ncreating of such institutions inevitably creates situations where\npeace and justice must clash: the need to quickly set up a competent\ncourt and police systems to allow for stable government may well\nrequire hiring administrators tainted during the tenure of the\nprevious regime; the need to attract foreign investors and maintain\npeace in the streets may require some compromises on the extent and\nlength of criminal proceedings against past perpetrators, and so\nforth.\n\n\nTo recap, the tension between peace and justice is especially\npronounced in transitional settings because creating the basic\ninstitutions of governance is more likely to raise it, and because the\nguidance available in settled context from the existence of such\ninstitutions is missing. To this dual explanation we should add that\nthe conflict between peace and justice is further heightened in\ntransitional situations because the political stakes are uniquely high\nduring such moments. If a transitional society cannot consolidate\npeace and functioning government, the very effort to create a decent\nnew state suffers shipwreck. This kind of fragility, where the entire\npolitical project is at stake, is more likely to float peace versus\njustice dilemmas than a specific crisis in a consolidated democracy.\nSuch localized crises typically implicate localized endeavors, not the\nexistence of the political system itself.\n2. War Crime Tribunals\n2.1 Historical Background\n\n\nThe 20th century's most famous and probably most\nsignificant war crime trials were held in Nuremberg, Germany after the\nend of World War\n II.[7]\n Between 1945\u20131949 the United States\nand its allies held a series of 13 trials.  The first, and most famous\nof these, involved the prosecution of senior surviving Nazi officials\nincluding Hermann G\u00f6ring, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Julius Streicher,\nRudolf Hess and Albert Speer. Defendants in the other 12 trials, which\ntook place between 1946\u20131949, included doctors, jurists,\nindustrialists, and other key stake holders in the Nazi state.\n Initially, it was not clear that the allies would put their\ndefeated enemies on trial at all. The creation of the first Nuremberg\nTribunal was preceded by a long debate, especially fierce in the\nUnited States.  Hard liners, represented most vocally by American\nSecretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr., advocated the summary\nexecution or forced removal of the entire Nazi chain of command and\nthe destruction of Germany's industrial capacities. On the other hand,\nLegalists, led by Secretary of War Henry Stimson, insisted on\naffording the Nazis fair trials that would honor American procedural\nprotections. The United States fought the war in defense of political\nfreedom, the Legalists insisted. Such freedom depends on upholding the\nideals of the rule of law. These ideals, in turn, require the\nindividualization of guilt and giving defendants a fair chance to\nanswer the charges against them.  Germany, Stimson warned, must not be\npunished en-masse; such collective punishment would only serve to\nincrease resentment and may well plant the seeds for another\nwar. Instead, the careful and fair employment of the courts would\nallow the Germans to \u201cinternalize\u201d their guilt. As Stimson\nput it:\n \u2026punishment is for the purpose of prevention\nand not for vengeance. An element in prevention is to secure in the\nperson punished the conviction of guilt\u201d (for a summary of this\ndebate see Bass 2002: 152\u2013161).\n\n\nOn November 21, 1945 Robert H. Jackson, Chief of Counsel for the\nUnited States at Nuremberg, began the case for the prosecution with\nthe following, now iconic words:\n The privilege of opening the first trial in history\nfor crimes against the peace of the world imposes a grave\nresponsibility. The wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have\nbeen so calculated, so malignant, and so devastating, that\ncivilization cannot tolerate their being ignored, because it cannot\nsurvive their being repeated. That four great nations, flushed with\nvictory and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance and\nvoluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is\none of the most significant tributes that Power has ever paid to\nReason. (Jackson 1945)\n\n\nThe prosecution team at Nuremberg had originally planned to\nconcentrate on charges of aggressive war rather than on Germany's\nwholesale destruction of Europe's Jews. Much of the initial legal work\nrevolved around the creation of a jurisprudence of conspiracy that\nwould allow the conviction of the entire Nazi leadership. But the\nliberation of the Dachau and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps, and\nthe horrific evidence discovered there, left the allies with little\nchoice but to incorporate charges of crimes against humanity into\ntheir trial strategy (Bass 2002: 180).\n The defendants' complaints about \u201cvictors' justice\u201d\nand the retroactivity of the charges not withstanding (more on this to\nfollow), the Nuremberg trials still stand out as \u201clegalism's\ngreatest moment of glory\u201d (Bass 2002: 203). In spite of intense\npolitical pressure by Stalin, Churchill, and powerful figures inside\nthe United States to dispense with trials all together, and in spite\nof the unprecedented nature and magnitude of the crimes, the judges at\nNuremberg presided over a remarkably cool and orderly procedure. For\nthe first time in history, senior political leaders were indicted and\ntried for \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d\n\n\nThe tribunals also established important principles of international\njustice, such as the responsibility of heads of state, the rejection\nof the infamous \u201cI was just following orders\u201d excuse, the\nweakening of retroactivity as a defense against crimes of mass\natrocity, and the right of war criminals to a fair\n trial.[8]\n In addition to these\nimportant legal achievements, Nuremberg also established the trial as\nan invaluable instrument for creating a credible, lasting historical\nrecord of human rights abuses.\n\n\nThe Nuremberg trials were succeeded, in the spring of 1946, by the\nMilitary Tribunal for the Far East, held in Tokyo. Twenty-eight\nmembers of Japan's military and political leadership, including former\nPrime Ministers, War and Navy Secretaries, generals, diplomats, and\nsome economic luminaries were indicted for crimes against the peace.\nTwenty-five of the defendants were convicted. Seven were executed, and\nthe remaining 18 received prison sentences ranging between 7 years and\na life sentence.\n\n\nThe Tokyo proceedings never achieved the prominence of the Nuremberg\ntribunals. Explanations for their relative obscurity include the\nunavailability of some of the trial records, the fact that the\nperpetrators were not household names in the west, and the allies'\nembarrassment about disagreements between the judges on using the\ndeath sentence, and on the fairness of the proceedings (for more\ndetail see Futamura 2008 and Totani 2008).\n In spite of the ambitious standards of accountability for mass\natrocity set at Nuremberg and Tokyo, the actual practice of\ninternational criminal justice went into a prolonged lull once the\nCold War began. The sharp ideological differences between the\nsuperpowers made the cosmopolitan ideals underlying such trials less\npersuasive.  Concerned that war crime prosecutions would become one\nmore arena for political conflict, neither the Americans nor the\nRussians pursued them. The lull ended with the collapse of the Soviet\nUnion and the end of the Cold War, and the first significant war\ntribunals thereafter were established by the United Nations in the\n1990s\u2014the ad hoc International Criminal Tribunal for the former\nYugoslavia at The Hague (ICTY), in 1993, and the ad hoc International\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Tanzania (ICTR), in 1995.\n The ICTY got off to a rocky start. Tribunal president Theodor\nMeron described it as \u201clittle more than an ideal\u201d at its\ninception in 1993. The trial, a symbolic \u201cexpression of\noutrage\u201d, served more as a salve for international guilt than\ninstrument of international justice. Financial resources were\ninitially so meager that the court could not afford to pay more than a\nfew months worth of rent and salaries (Bass 2002: Ch. 6). But in\nrecent years, the tribunal has come into its own. While the historic\ntrial of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 could not be completed because of the\ndefendant's death, the ICTY indicted the first President of Republika\nSrpska (Bosnia and Herzogovina), Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107, in July 2008. He is\ncurrently conducting his defense. Additionally, Ratko Mladi\u0107, the\nmilitary mastermind of the siege Sarajevo and the massacre of\nSrebenica, was arrested in northern Serbia on 26 May 2011 and is\ncurrently on trial in the Hague. Biljana Plav\u0161i\u0107, another former\nPresident of Republika Srpska, was convicted of war crimes in\n2002.\n The final trial for the ICTY has recently commenced. Goran Had\u017ei\u0107,\nwho went from warehouse worker to rebel Serbian president, was\narrested in northern Serbia on July 20, 2011 after seven years as a\nfugitive. He has pled not guilty to \u201cinvolvement in the murder\nof hundreds of Croats\u201d as well as large scale expulsions. He is\nthe last of the 161 suspects indicted by ICTY to face trial. Had\u017ei\u0107,\nKarad\u017ei\u0107, and Mladi\u0107 were all arrested in Serbia after years on the\nrun from international justice. The impending terminus of the court's\nactivities underscores the transitory nature of such ad hoc war crimes\ntribunals.The court's annual budget is now upwards of $310 million and\nit employs more than 1,100 people from 82 countries. The ICTY has\nconvicted 64, acquitted 13, sent 13 for trial in domestic courts, and\nwithdrawn indictments against 36, including 16 who died after being\ncharged. Eighteen suspects are currently being tried, while 17 are\nappealing their convictions.\n\n\nThe tribunal often faced, and to some extent still faces, accusations\nof inefficacy. Ad hoc tribunals lack their own coercive power and rely\non the support of individual nation-states. Little progress was\ninitially made in the 1990s towards the capture of important war\ncriminals in the former Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was not then in a truly\ntransitional state such as found in Germany or Japan at the end of\nWWII, as the Serbian government of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, who had\nsupported the Bosnian Serb commanders, remained in power. There was,\nas in other regions in which war crimes have occurred, hostility to\noutside monitoring and extranational justice. This was also seen to a\nlesser extent in Croatia. However, national (or domestic) justice\nproved itself to be overwhelmingly corrupt, biased, incompetent, and\ninadequate.\n\n\nOnly after Milo\u0161evi\u0107's fall from power did the new Serbian government\nbecome more amenable to cooperating with demands for international\njustice. The rebel Serbian leaders did and still do retain the\nsympathies of much of the Serbian population. External pressure points\nproved to be effective, as Serbia's government responded positively to\na carrot and stick approach known as the policy of\nconditionality. Serbia's European Union (EU) membership application\nwas blocked until Serbia complied and arrested the trio of Mladi\u0107,\nKarad\u017ei\u0107, and Had\u017ei\u0107. The principle behind conditionality does not\ndiffer significantly from the rationale behind sanctions regimes, such\nas those employed against apartheid South Africa, Rhodesia, and\n(currently) Iran.\n\nThe ICTR, located in Arusha, Tanzania, can also boast substantial\nachievements. The court has issued the first ever genocide conviction\nby an international tribunal, as well as the first conviction in which\nrape was considered a crime of war. Given the massive domestic\nprosecution of g\u00e9nocidaires by the Rwandan authorities, the\nICTR has primarily focused on the indictment of \u201cbig\nfish\u201d\u2014senior level suspects involved in the design and\nplanning of the genocide. These indictments have resulted in genocide\nconvictions of Rwanda's former Prime Minister, Jean Kambanda, and\nquite a few cabinet members.\n\n\nIn addition to securing significant convictions and setting legal\nprecedents for the practice of international humanitarian law, the\nICTY and ICTR were also successful in creating detailed records of\natrocities. In this, both tribunals continued the legacy of the\nNuremberg Tribunals, which, as mentioned earlier, aimed not merely at\nthe conviction of the guilty but also at reliably documenting the\nhorrors for\n posterity.[9]\n\n\n\nA complaint consistently made against the ICTY and the ICTR has been\nthat these tribunals do not operate on the sites where the crimes\nbeing investigated took place. This fact, so the criticism goes,\ncreates a disconnect between the people who suffered throughout the\nwar and the process in which their suffering is addressed. The attempt\nto address such criticisms has resulted in the creation of a rather\ninnovative form of international justice\u2014the Internationalized\nor Hybrid Courts. These bodies, which have been operating in Bosnia\nHerzegovina (since 2005), Kosovo (since 2000), Cambodia (since 2003),\nSierra Leone (since 2002), East Timor (between 1999\u20132005), and\nLebanon (since 2007), employ both international and local jurists and\nadjudicate on the basis of a mixture of national and\n international\nlaw.[10]\n Unlike\nthe Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals none of the ad hoc tribunals such as\nthe ITCY and ITCR are empowered to impose the death penalty, though no\ncentralized prison exists to house those convicted.\n\n\nAmong the criticisms levied against the tribunals is their alleged\nWestern bias. The Special Court for Sierra Leone, which in April of\n2012 convicted former Liberian leader Charles Taylor of aiding and\nabetting war crimes, was funded almost exclusively by the United\nStates, United Kingdom, Canada, and the Netherlands. The international\ncourts and the human rights which they embody are Western liberal\nconcepts with far less resonance in other parts of the world. Some\nhave questioned the tribunals are too focused on Africa, as all\npending cases currently are Africa-related. The Africa Union has\naccused the ICC of being an Euro-American neo-colonial enterprise,\nthough this may be taken with a certain pinch of salt, as many of the\nleaders within the African Union have good reason to believe that they\nmay one day be called to the defendant's docket.\n\n\nPerhaps the most significant development in international criminal\njustice since the Nuremberg trials has been the establishment, by the\nRome treaty in 1998, of the permanent International Criminal Court\n(ICC) in The Hague. By 2011, 114 nations had ratified the Rome\nStatute.  The court has jurisdiction over serious crimes (genocide,\ncrimes against humanity, aggression) committed after July 1, 2002\n(when the statute took effect), by a national of one of the states\nthat are party to the Rome treaty. It also has jurisdiction over\ncrimes committed on the territory of such state parties, or when the\nUN Security Council refers a specific case to it. The UN Security\nCouncil is authorized not only to refer cases to the court but also to\nask its prosecutor to suspend proceedings. Nevertheless, Security\nCouncil members Russia, China, and the United States have not ratified\nthe statute. This position is shared by several other major countries\nsuch as India, Indonesia, and Israel. Within the next several years,\ntribunals for Sierra Leone, Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, Lebanon,\nand Cambodia will close, leaving the ICC as the sole institution of\ninternational criminal justice.\n\n\nImportantly, the court's authority is residuary: it acts only if\nmember nations cannot or will not.\n\n\nMost of the cases before the ICC involve ongoing conflicts. This has\nrequired the establishment of field offices in order to assist in\ninvestigations and the collection of evidence, as well as to conduct\noutreach operations to local populations. While there are immense\npractical difficulties in gathering evidence and enforcing arrest\nwarrants in active war zones, senior ICC officials have claimed that\ntheir real time involvement has increased deterrence.\n [11]\n\n\n\nSo far the ICC has taken up cases of war crimes committed in Uganda,\nthe Congo, and the Central African Republic. All three countries have\nreferred these cases themselves. In addition, the UN Security Council\nhas referred the case of Sudan, which is not a party to the Rome\ntreaty. After conducting an investigation into the referral, the\ncourt's prosecutor has recently issued an indictment against Sudan's\nPresident, Omar\n al-Bashir.[12]\n A decade after the courts creation, 22\narrest warrants have been issued, and five suspects currently are in\ncustody. Recently (as of July 2012), the United States has started to\napply pressure on President Paul Kagame of Rwanda to end his\nassistance to rebel factions in Congo renowned for their egregious war\ncrimes. The United States indicated that there might be a reduction in\nmilitary aid to Rwanda, but also that Kagame personally may face\nindictment and (ultimately) prosecution at the ICC.\n\n\nOne of the most innovative features of the ICC is the fact that it\ngives a significant role to victims in its proceedings. Victims can\nsend information directly to the court's prosecutor, they can request\nthe opening of a preliminary investigation, they can appear before the\ncourt's pre-trial chamber when it deliberates on whether to open a\nfull blown investigation into a case, and, most significantly, they\ncan ask to present their position during the trial itself. Article 68\n(3) of the ICC Statute reads:\n where the personal interests of the victims are\naffected, the Court shall permit their views and concerns to be\npresented and considered at stages of the proceedings determined to be\nappropriate by the Court and in a manner which is not prejudicial to\nor inconsistent with the rights of the accused to a fair and impartial\ntrial. Such views and concerns may be presented by the legal\nrepresentatives of the victims where the Court considers it\nappropriate, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.\n(see Other Internet Resources for link to the full\ntext of the Rome Statute)\n\n  The exact jurisprudence regulating victims' involvement is still\n  being developed.  Yet, it is already clear that the Rome statute\n  gives them a far greater role in the international criminal process\n  than they have had under traditional tribunals.\n\n\nDespite the fact that the United States played a major role in the\nnegotiations surrounding the creation of the ICC, the U.S. initially\nvoted against the Rome Statute in 1998, before eventually signing in\nDecember\n 2000.[13]\n President George W. Bush revoked the\nUnited States' signature to the Rome Statute, citing concerns that the\ncourt could be used for political prosecution of American citizens,\nparticularly American service members who were serving abroad. The\nU.S. Congress passed several bills during the Bush Administration\ndesigned to shield American citizens from prosecution by the ICC. The\nUnited States has also threatened to cut off foreign aid to countries\nthat have failed to sign Bilateral Immunity Agreements with the\nU.S.\n\n\nAlthough the Obama administration has been much less hostile towards\nthe ICC, going so far as to co-sponsor a UN Security Council\nresolution which called for the ICC to investigate alleged crimes\nagainst humanity committed by Muammar Gadaffi, the United States has\nyet to join the\n ICC.[14]\n The United States continues to make\nimmunity for U.S. citizens a prerequisite to their ascension to the\nICC. \n2.2 Criticisms of war crime tribunals\n The employment of war crime tribunals has always been\ncontroversial.  In what follows some of the central criticisms of such\ntrials are examined. We will focus on substantive rather than\ntechnical concerns.  \u201cTechnical concerns\u201d is understood as\nthe lack of resources, the reluctance of the international community\nto provide material assistance (in direct funds or in apprehension of\nsuspects), the ability of defendants to destroy evidence, the\ndeplorable condition of the legal class in war torn countries, and\nproblems of translation and common language. While these certainly are\nsignificant obstacles (as it was pointed out earlier, the operation of\nthe ICTY was almost undermined by such difficulties), they do not\nchallenge the rationale for using trials. The objections taken up\nhere, on the other hand, represent concerns that call into question\nthe coherence and fairness of the criminal courts as instruments of\npolitical transition.\n2.2.1 Victor's Justice\n\n\nAccording to some critics, post war tribunals, far from expressing a\ncommitment to the rule of law, are merely a charade in which winners\npunish losers for the damage and suffering the war brought about. This\nkind of cynicism about doing justice after war (and about the role of\njustice in politics more generally) has ancient roots. In his\nHistory of the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides (B.5 Ch.17)\nimagines one of the Athenian generals offering a sobering reality\ncheck to a Melian politician who does not understand why Athens must\nconquer his tiny, politically neutral island:\n we both alike know that in the discussion of human\naffairs the question of justice only enters where there is equal power\nto enforce it, and that the powerful exact what they can, and the weak\ngrant what they must.\n Hermann G\u00f6ring made a similar observation in a conversation with\nNuremberg's prison psychiatrist: \u201cthe victor will always be the\njudge, and the vanquished the accused\u201d (Bass 2002: 8).\n\n\nThe claim of victor's justice is difficult to\n dismiss.[15]\n After all, had the\nAllies lost the war, many of their senior military and political\nleaders would have gone on trial for the firebombing of Japanese and\nGerman cities. Curtis LeMay and Robert McNamara have publicly admitted\nas\n much.[16]\n And\nyet it is worthwhile noting, with Gary Bass, that there is a\ndistinction between the circumstances under which a tribunal is\ncreated and how decently and fairly it operates. In other words, a\ntribunal that was set up after victory in order to punish the side\nthat lost, might still either succeed or fail to follow fair\nprocedures. And in so far as this is true, the retribution of some\nvictors may be preferable to that of others. As Bass writes: \u201cit\nis victory that makes justice possible but the fairness of the process\nis what makes it justice\u201d (Bass 2002: 329). And, he adds, even\nthough we may be cynical about the fact that Americans are putting\nGermans on trial after they have defeated them, most of us, if given a\nhypothetical choice, would still prefer to be tried by an American\nrather than a Nazi court, because we assume it would be fairer (for a\nuseful series of essays on the Rwandan transition see Strauss and\nWaldorf 2011). Simply imagine the kind of charges the Nazis would\nbring against their defeated enemies: most likely, they would have not\nsufficed with indicting the allies for the firebombing of German and\nJapanese cities; they might also have charged then with protecting\nJews or with miscegenation, and perhaps punished them severely for\nthese charges.  While an indictment for firebombing would have been\nsubstantially sound, the latter accusations would have been based,\nexclusively, on the Nazis warped racial theories. In other words, some\nvictors' justice can be substantively flawed. Here, then, is the main\nadvantage of allied over Nazi victor's justice: the Americans and\ntheir partners prosecuted their defeated enemies for crimes that\nreally were crimes (for further discussions of victors' justice see\nMinow 1998; Chang and Barker 2001; Peskin 2005).\n2.2.2 Retroactivity\n\n\nA second important criticism of post war trials is that they hold\ndefendants responsible for acts that were not prohibited at the time\nthey were committed.\n\n\nMany of the Nazi defendants at Nuremberg argued that no existing laws\nor international standards banned their conduct during the war.\nConsequently, they argued, there can be no legal basis for prosecuting\nthem. Such claims are based on a fundamental precept of the rule of\nlaw: Nullum Crimen, Nulla Poena Sine Lege (no crime, no\npunishment without a legal prohibition). The main strategy used to\ncounter these arguments at Nuremberg was \u201cpositivistic\u201d:\nprosecutors strained to find sources in existing international law\nthat did forbid aggressive war, and then moved to associate many of\nthe other crimes for which the Nazis were accused with the waging of\nsuch war (Minow 1998: 33). A related difficulty arose when the\nprosecution looked for a legal doctrine that would allow them to\nconvict a large group of people for belonging to the Nazi war\nmachine. Here, too, a creative positivistic solution was found: One of\nStimson's aids, colonel Murray Bernays, devised the idea that the\nNazis would be tried as part of a criminal conspiracy. The advantage\nof such a strategy was that it required nothing more than the\nconviction of specific organizations of the charges (the SA, SS,\nGestapo among others) in order to hold all their members\nresponsible. As Bass puts it:\n once these organizations had been convicted, any\nmember of them could be swiftly punished: instead of proving\nindividual guilt\u2026 [prosecutors] would only have to provide that\nthe defendant had been a member of a criminal group activities. (Bass\n2002: 171; I am grateful to Thomas Pogge for this\npoint)\n The severity of the problem of retroactivity decreased after the\nNuremberg tribunal established the precedent that there was no need\nfor a highly specific prohibition in order to be held responsible\nbefore an international criminal court. And yet, the tribunals for\nYugoslavia and Rwanda still faced some problems of retroactivity when\nit came to deciding whether ethnic cleansing constituted genocide and\nwhat kind of intent was required for a genocide conviction (Minow\n1998: 34\u201335).\n While prosecutors in Nuremberg settled on a positivistic strategy\nfor countering the claims of retroactivity made by the defendants,\nanother possibility for rejecting such arguments should be mentioned.\nThis alternative is based in the \u201cnatural law\u201d tradition.\nOn this view, the response the Nazi defendants should have been given\nis, quite simply, that there are things that one does not do, or can\nexpect severe punishment for doing, whether they are explicitly\nforbidden or not. Whether such severe actions defy \u201cthe moral\nlaw\u201d to use the somewhat antiquated language of the classical\nnatural lawyers, or whether they simply offend fundamental\nsensibilities of any civilized human being, the upshot is the same: at\nthe extreme reaches of human behavior illegality does not necessarily\ndepend on a prior legal prohibition. It was this kind of argument that\nthe lead British prosecutor in Nuremberg, Hartley Shawcross, had in\nmind when he exclaimed in response to one of the iterations of the\nretroactivity complaint:\n I suppose the first person ever charged with murder\nmight have said: \u201cnow see here. You can't do that.  Murder\nhasn't been made a crime yet\u201d.  (Persico 1994:\n138)\n2.2.3 Selectivity\n A third important complaint against war crime tribunals maintains\nthat they frequently fail to indict all of those who were involved in\ncommitting atrocities. According to this charge, courts find it easier\nto prosecute lower level officials and military personnel, often\nleaving the more senior figures who devised the violent policies (but\ndo not have actual \u201cblood on their hands\u201d) untouched\n(Minow 1998: 40\u201341). To the extent that this complaint is well\nfounded it is devastating, as it suggests that war crime tribunals do\nnot result in a full or coherent exercise of retributive justice (for\na comprehensive account see Cryer 2005).  The principle of\n\u201cCommand Responsibility\u201d (CR) originally devised at\nNuremberg, and used extensively by the ICTY, has been employed, quite\neffectively, in order to counter complaints of selectivity. CR allows\nprosecutors to indict senior officials exclusively on the basis of\ntheir military or political leadership role (given the duties of\nsupervision and control attached to that role).\n\n\nThus, the ICTY has been able to convict Serbian officers for war\ncrimes because they did not prevent or curtail activities in which\ntheir troops were engaged. In an especially striking expansion of CR,\na Bosnian Croat regional commander, Tihomir Blaskic, was convicted by\nthe trial chamber of the ICTY of murder and other crimes against\nhumanity, for atrocities that took place in the village of\nAhmichi. The charges did not allege direct involvement or even turning\na blind eye to the activities of subordinates, but, rather, focused on\nBlaskic's failure to investigate after the massacre was brought to his\nattention. His unwillingness to look into the events was equated by\nthe court with responsibility for direct killing. In 2004 the appeals\nchamber of the ICTY rejected this interpretation of CR and overturned\nthe relevant part of the conviction.\n\n\nWhile CR can be instrumental for moving up the chain of command, it\nalso comes into conflict with the legalistic premise underlying war\ncrime tribunals. A criminal trial traditionally establishes individual\nresponsibility by presenting direct evidence against the defendant. CR\nallows conviction and punishment based on a philosophical construct\nrather than on the garnering of such evidence. The construct, roughly\nspeaking, is that certain roles come with built in accountability for\nthe actions of others, whether or not the individual who holds the\nrole was aware of these actions. Criminal law doctrine is, to say the\nleast, suspicious of such a separation between intent and culpability,\nespecially when it comes to very serious offenses (lesser offenses can\nbe established by proving the defendant was reckless or indifferent).\nThis tension points to a problem at the heart of international\ncriminal law: does the unique nature of mass atrocity, wherein\nnumerous people harm others with differing degrees of acquiescence and\ndirection from a large bureaucratic class, really lend itself to the\nlegalistic commitment to individualizing guilt on the basis of direct\nevidence? Or do the distinct features of such crimes require relaxing\nour standards of individual responsibility so as to implicate the\nentire state structure that made the atrocities\n possible?[17]\n If the latter, it\nmay be difficult to hold fast to the justification of such trials as\nexpressing a firm commitment to legalism and the idea of the rule\n of\nlaw.[18]\n\n\n\nOther significant (if less conceptually interesting) criticisms of the\ninternational criminal courts hold that they do not focus sufficiently\non the suffering of victims, concentrating, instead, on establishing\nthe guilt of\n perpetrators),[19]\n that the proceeding tend to become\ntechnical and tedious, thus trivializing the horrors\n being\ndiscussed,[20]\n\nthat there can be a discrepancy between the (Western) cultural norms\ncentral to legalism and the local traditions of the society in which\natrocities took\n place,[21]\n and that, in light of the repeated\noccurrence of genocide in the 20th century, the practice of\ninternational criminal law does not show great promise\n of\ndeterrence.[22]\nLeaders, such as Bashar al-Assad and Omar\nal-Bashir, who have the backing of major powers, have virtual\nimpunity. Of course it is important to prosecute former heads of\nstate, so as to demonstrate that political seniority is no guarantee\nof immunity from justice. The international tribunals serve a\npedagogical purpose, drawing attention to pertinent issues such as\nchild conscription.\n3. Truth Commissions\n3.1 Historical Background\n\n\nThe structural and political shortcomings of war crime trials, as\noutlined in the previous section, have led policy makers in war torn\ncountries to turn to other measures of transitional justice. The most\nimportant among these is the non-judicial truth commission.\n\n\nPriscilla Hayner (2002), in her landmark book on truth commissions,\nenumerates four characteristics typical of these bodies:\n\nThey deal with the past\nThey investigate continued patterns of abuses and not specific cases \nThey operate for up to two years and then submit reports\nsummarizing their findings and, \nThey are usually official bodies sanctioned by the state.\n\n These commissions, Hayner continues, most often have some or all\nof the following goals: unearthing, clarifying and formally\nacknowledging past abuses, responding to the needs of victims, helping\ncreate a culture of accountability, outlining institutional\nresponsibility and possible reforms, advancing the prospects of\nreconciliation and reducing conflict over the past (Hayner 2002:\n24).\n\n\nWhile truth commissions have fewer coercive powers than courts (they\ncannot compel governments to carry out their recommendations, they\nhave no authority to punish etc.), their mandate for investigating the\nbroader pattern of abuses, and their tendency to put the victims at\nthe center of their proceeding, gives these bodies a great degree of\nmoral credibility and legitimacy.\n\n\nThe work of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission\n(hereafter TRC) has sparked a great deal of interest in the use of\ntruth commissions after war. The celebrity of its chair, Desmond Tutu,\nthe massive scale of the public hearings it held, the intensive media\ncoverage, and its controversial amnesty-for-truth mechanism, generated\na great deal of international curiosity. Ever since the TRC completed\nits hearings and published its report, nations facing a transition to\ndemocracy have consistently asked themselves whether they too should\nuse truth commissions to confront past abuses. Some scholars even go\nso far as to say that the truth commission has now replaced criminal\nprosecution as the most important norm of international justice (see,\nfor example, Ben-Josef Hirsch 2007).\n\n\nWhile the TRC has become paradigmatic of truth commissions, it is\nworthwhile noting that it was not the first such body. Argentina,\nChile, and El Salvador all employed relatively effective truth\ncommissions during the 1980's and early\n 1990's.[23]\n\n\n\nThese efforts provided both inspiration and valuable lessons for the\ndesigners of the South African\n body.[24]\n\n\n\nIn Argentina, a truth commission was set up to investigate the abuses\ncommitted by the military junta during the country's \u201cdirty\nwar\u201d (1976\u20131983). It is estimated that up to 30,000\nsuspected \u201csubversives\u201d were\n\u201cdisappeared\u201d\u2014abducted, tortured and disposed of\nsecretly\u2014by security forces during those years. Unlike the South\nAfrican TRC, the Argentinean body, officially named \u201cNational\nCommission on the Disappearance of Persons\u201d, did not hold public\nhearings. The commission also lacked the authority and incentive\nstructure to compel cooperation from the military. And yet, it was\nable to produce a substantive report. More than 7000 statements were\ntaken, 1500 of which were given by survivors of military detention\ncamps. The commission focused on locating and exposing military\ndetention and torture centers. Much of the evidence it gathered was\nhanded over to prosecutors, eventually aiding in the convictions of\nseveral high-ranking officers. The truth commission's report, titled\nNever Again (Nunca M\u00e1s), was published in 1984 and\nhas become one of the best-selling books in Argentinean history.\n\n\nSeven years later, Chile's National Commission on Truth and\nReconciliation published a report documenting human rights abuses\ncommitted by the Chilean army during General Augusto Pinochet's\n17-year reign. As in Argentina, Chile's security forces practiced\nroutine torture, abductions and extrajudicial executions. The abuses\nwere especially severe in the first few years of the dictatorship. In\n1978 Pinochet issued a sweeping amnesty order, protecting all members\nof the security forces. This amnesty created a complex constitutional\nenvironment for the truth commission. The commission, chaired by\nformer senator Raul Retting, consisted of an equal number of Pinochet\nsupporters and critics. Its mandate was defined in relatively narrow\nterms, focusing on executions, disappearances and cases of torture\nthat resulted in death (leaving out a large number of torture\nsurvivors).  Like its Argentinean counterpart, the commission had no\nway to compel members of the security forces to testify. The\nCommissioners looked into 3400 cases and issued an 1800 page report in\nFebruary of 1991 strongly (and, significantly, unanimously) condemning\nPinochet and his generals. The impact of the report was weakened by a\nseries of armed attacks carried out by left leaning militants shortly\nafter its publication. In spite of the limited public attention it\nreceived at the time, the report was instrumental in creating a\nreparations program for the relatives of Pinochet's victims. The\ncommission's work was also useful in providing evidence to support the\nSpanish extradition request that eventually led to Pinochet's arrest\nin Britain. Pinochet was later returned to Chile, and died before he\ncould be convicted of any crimes.\n El Salvador's truth commission was probably the least successful\nof the three. The commission was created to investigate abuses carried\nout in the course of the civil war between government forces and FMLN\nguerrillas. According to some estimates, the 12-year war\n(1980\u20131992) claimed the lives of 75,000 citizens. As in\nArgentina and Chile, the military engaged in executions, torture, and\nabductions, in addition to large-scale massacres. The El Salvadorian\ncommission operated for 8 months. Appointed by the Secretary General\nof the United Nations, its members included former Colombian President\nBelisario Betancur, former President of the Inter American Court of\nHuman Rights Thomas Buergenthal, and former Minister of Foreign\nAffairs of Venezuela Reinaldo Figueredo Planchart. The animosity and\ndiffidence between the former combatants was such that no Salvadorians\nwere allowed to serve as commissioners.\n The commission gathered testimony on more than 7000 cases of\nsevere human rights violations. Its final report, titled \u201cFrom\nMadness to Hope\u201d, outlined a set of harsh conclusions against 40\ngovernment and military officials and stated that the vast majority of\natrocities had been committed by government backed security forces\n(rather than by FMLN fighters). Very shortly after the report's\npublication, a national amnesty law was passed, rendering many of the\ncommission's recommendations irrelevant. However, the report was\nhelpful in shaming and eventually removing from service some of the\nmilitary officials accused of especially egregious abuses.\n\n\nThree years after the release of El Salvador's report, On April 15,\n1996, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the head of South Africa's Anglican\nChurch, addressed a crowd gathered at East London's city hall. \n\nWe are charged to unearth the truth about our dark past,\n\n he told his listeners,\n and to lay the ghosts of that past to rest so that\nthey will not return to haunt us; and that we will thereby contribute\nto the healing of the traumatized and the wounded\u2014for all of us\nin South Africa are wounded people. (Meredith 1999:\n3)\n\n  Thus began South Africa's controversial experiment in transitional\n \n justice.[25]\n\n\n\nAs they debated how to manage the transition from apartheid,\nnegotiators on behalf of the African National Congress (hereafter ANC)\nand the outgoing National Party clashed repeatedly on the question of\nhow to address human rights abuses committed during the apartheid era.\nIn the negotiations leading up to the 1993 interim constitution, which\nlaid down the terms of the transition, the most contentious issue\nconcerned the question of amnesty. After a great deal of wrangling,\nthe two sides agreed to add a postamble to the constitution containing\nthe following language:\n in order to advance\u2026 reconciliation and\nreconstruction, amnesty shall be granted in respect of acts,\nomissions, and offenses associated with political objectives and\ncommitted in the course of the conflicts of the past.\u201d\n(Postamble to South Africa's Interim Constitution of 1993 as quoted in\nMeredith 1999: 20\u201321)\n Many ANC supporters, who wanted to see apartheid officials brought\nbefore Nuremberg style war crime tribunals, were understandably upset\nby the arrangement. Nelson Mandela, who insisted on the importance of\nsteering clear of \u201cvictors' justice\u201d, remained adamant\nabout the need for some kind of accountability for apartheid's\ncrimes. Without such reckoning, he threatened, the unaddressed\natrocities of the past would live with South Africans like a\n\u201cfestering sore\u201d (Meredith 1999: 18).\n The convergence between these two commitments\u2014to amnesty on\nthe one hand and to accountability on the other\u2014was to result in\nthe establishment of the TRC.\n\n\nThe process that led to the commission's creation was characterized by\nan unprecedented degree of transparency and public participation.\nDuring 1994, two major conferences were held to lay the groundwork for\nthe TRC's work. Both were organized by Alex Boraine, an Anti-Apartheid\nactivist who served as president of the South African Methodist\nChurch, MP for the progressive party, and the director of important\ncivil society NGOs. The first of these conferences focused on the\nlessons of political transitions in Latin America and Eastern Europe\n(Proceedings were published in Boraine et al. 1994).  The second\nsolicited input from stakeholders inside South Africa (Proceedings\nwere published in Boraine et al. 1995).  After the conferences, South\nAfrica's parliament began deliberating on the National Unity and\nReconciliation Act, which would set up the commission. The\nParliamentary Standing Committee on Justice held extended public\nhearings asking individuals, political parties and NGOs for their\nadvice on the design of the TRC. The law was finally passed, after a\ngreat deal of bickering and debate, in May of 1995, a year or so after\nit was first presented. The TRC thus became the first commission of\nits kind to be created through a parliamentary process rather than\nexecutive\n decree.[26]\n Whether by design or inertia, this open,\ndeliberative approach was also applied to the selection of commission\nmembers. Nominees were suggested by NGOs, churches, and political\nparties, and were then interviewed in public by the selection\ncommittee. Finally, the cabinet and president chose the commissioners\nfrom a short list.\n\n\nThe Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act set the\nfollowing three goals for the commission:\n to develop a complete picture of the gross violations\nof human rights that took place in and came through the conflicts of\nthe past; to restore to victims their human and civil dignity by\nletting them tell their stories and recommending how they could be\nassisted; and to consider granting amnesty to those perpetrators who\ncarried out their abuses for political reasons and who gave full\naccountings to their actions to the commission. (Graybill 2002:\n6).\n\n\nThe commission would respect the ANC's promise to offer amnesties, but\nthe reprieve would not be granted automatically. It would, rather, be\nlinked to a demand for full disclosure from perpetrators. Those\nseeking amnesty would have to apply for it, provide full details about\nwhat they had done, and establish that their activities were\npolitically motivated (rather than the result of greed,\n sadism\netc.).[27]\n\nApplicants would not, however, be required to apologize or otherwise\nexpress regret.  Furthermore, the arrangement would eliminate not only\ncriminal responsibility but also civil\n liability.[28]\n Successful\napplicants could be neither charged nor sued for their conduct during\nthe apartheid years. The commission would be charged with\ninvestigating abuses that took place between March 1, 1960 and May 10,\n1994.\n\n\nThe commission was divided into three committees in order to realize\nthe aims set out by the law: the committee on human rights violations,\nthe committee on amnesty, and the committee on reparation and\nrehabilitation. The first would collect testimony and conduct public\nhearings regarding the abuses. The second would consider applications\nfor amnesty from members of the security forces and ANC, and determine\nwhether the acts in question were committed in a political context and\nwhether applicants had provided full disclosure about them. The third\nwould come up with recommendations and criteria for whom to compensate\nand how.\n\n\nThe TRC's authority and resources were unprecedented in the history of\ntruth commissions. It had the power to subpoena witnesses and the\nauthority to order searches and seizures. It had a witness protection\nprogram, 300 staff members, and an annual budget of 18 million\ndollars.  Its proceedings were broadcast on a daily basis on both\nradio and television, and were widely covered by the printed\npress. During the course of its tenure, the commission took testimony\nfrom more than 22,000 victims and witnesses, hearing upwards of 2,000\nof them in public.\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, the main controversy surrounding the commission's work\nconcerned its amnesty-granting powers. The opportunity afforded to\nperpetrators of egregious human rights abuses to walk away from\nprosecution enraged many black South Africans who wanted to see those\nwho had tormented them and their families put behind bars. As far as\nmany blacks were concerned, the TRC allowed some of apartheid's worst\noffenders to \u201cget away with\n murder.\u201d[29]\n As Martin Meredith\n(1999: 315) puts it in his superb survey of the commission's\ntenure:\n \u2026the work of the TRC provoked\u2026anger in\nparts of the black community\u2026particularly over the way security\nforce operatives responsible for heinous crimes were given freedom in\nexchange for a bit of truth telling, while victims and their families\nwere denied access to the courts. What many wanted more than truth was\njustice\u2014prosecution in the courts and prison\nsentences.\n\n Many academic observers of South Africa's transition were dismayed as\n well, remarking that neither political necessity nor the attempt to\n create social solidarity can justify the kind of sacrifices of\n retributive justice the TRC's work entailed.\n\n\nThe outrage is more than understandable, when one considers cases like\nthat of Vlakplass commander Dirk Coetzee who testified to killing ANC\nactivist Sizwe Kondile and burning his body on an open bonfire.\nCoetzee and his men stood by, drinking beers and smoking for more than\nseven hours, until nothing remained of Kondile. The sight of such a\nman walking away from his testimony cannot but turn one's stomach.\n The international community has continued to experiment with truth\ncommissions as a means to achieve transitional justice. On July 13,\n2001, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor\n(UNTAET) established the Commission for Reception, Truth, and\nReconciliation (CRTR). The purpose of this commission is to promote\n\u201cnational reconciliation and healing\u201d after decades of\npolitical conflict following the 1975 invasion and subsequent\noccupation of East Timor by Indonesia.\n\n\nFollowing a failed attempt to annex East Timor in 1999,\nIndonesia-supported militants are suspected of killing over 1,000\nsupporters of an independent East Timor and caused hundreds of\nthousands of civilians to flee their homes (Stahn 2001).\n\n\nIn 2011, Brazil also created a truth commission to investigate and\npublicize human rights abuses that occurred during the rule of\nBrazil's military dictatorship from 1964\u20131985. The seven-person\ncommission was provided with a two-year mandate to investigate human\nrights abuses and to compile a file report to be released publicly.\nHowever, doubts regarding the truth commission remain as a result of a\n1979 law that provided amnesty to many of those responsible for crimes\ncommitted during the military regime's\n rule.[30]\n\n Much of the scholarly literature on the TRC in South Africa\ncenters on the question of justification, on the attempt to locate a\nrationale which might make sense of an arrangement that goes against a\ngreat deal of our untrained intuitions about justice. \u201cIf\njustice requires the prosecution and punishment of those who commit\ngross human rights violations\u201d, writes Elizabeth Kiss (2000:\n68), \u201cthen the amnesty offered by the TRC violates justice. Can\nthe TRC be defended against, or in spite of, this criticism?\u201d\nSimilarly, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson (2000: 22) point out\nthat:\n In a democratic society, and especially in a society\nthat is trying to overcome injustices of the past, trading criminal\njustice for a general social benefit such as social reconciliation\nrequires a moral defense if it is to be defensible. \n\nKent Greenwalt (2000: 191) echoes the same concern when he reminds us\nthat,\n those who decide whether to include amnesty as an\nadjunct to a truth commission must face two basic issues. Does\ngranting amnesty to murderers and torturers involve doing injustice?\nWhat might justify the state's doing such an\ninjustice?\n\n\nIn what follows, we offer a critical survey of some of the most\nimportant philosophical justifications of the TRC. The discussion\napplies to any truth commission with comparable powers (this\ndiscussion is based on Eisikovits 2004, 2006).\n3.2 Justifying Truth Commissions\n3.2.1 Deliberative democracy\n\n\nGutmann and Thompson (2000) argue that a justification of a truth\ncommission needs to meet three criteria relevant for the justification\nof all democratic institutions: it must be moral in principle,\ninclusive, and moral in practice. The first condition rules out what\nthe authors call the realist justification\u2014the claim\nthat the compromise embodied in the TRC was necessary in order to\navoid a civil war. The second demands that the justification employ\nreasons that are \u201cbroadly accessible and therefore inclusive of\nas many people as possible\u201d (2000: 23). The last requires that\nthe justification be based on reasons that \u201care to the extent\npossible embodied or exemplified by the commission's own\nproceedings\u201d (2000: 23). The justification that most fully meets\nthese three requirements, argue the authors, is one rooted in the\nconcepts of deliberative democracy and reciprocity. Central to\ndeliberative democracy is\n the idea that citizens and officials must justify any\ndemands for collective action by giving reasons that can be accepted\nby those who are bound by the action\u2026. (2000:\n35\u201336)\n\n  This, in turn, presupposes the notion of reciprocity\n which asks citizens to try to justify their political\nviews to one another, and to treat with respect those who\nmake\u2026efforts to engage in this mutual enterprise even when they\ncannot resolve their disagreements\u201d (2000: 36).\n\n\nTo the extent that a truth commission promotes such reciprocal\nexchanges it is morally justifiable, because such an exchange is, in\nitself, a moral good. The first condition is thus met. A commission\nbased in a conception of deliberative democracy is also inclusive\nsince the principle of reciprocity involves appeals to reasons that\nmake sense to a large number of participants in the political\nprocess:\n the standard of reciprocity also satisfies the second\nrequirement of justification by providing an inclusive perspective. A\nreciprocal perspective is one that cannot be reasonably rejected by\nany citizen committed to democracy because it requires only that each\nperson seek terms of cooperation that respect all as free and equal\ncitizens. (2000: 37)\n\n Finally, a commission committed to the principle of reciprocity is\n likely to function in a way that embodies that principle.\n Such a commission practices what it preaches about the\ndemocratic society that it is trying to help create. Reciprocity\nserves as a guide\u2026 for the commission itself, calling on the\ncommissioners and the testifiers to practice some of the skills and\nthe virtues of the democratic society they are striving to\ncreate\u2026 the openly participatory process by which members and\nstaff of the TRC were appointed, and the generally public process in\nwhich its proceedings were conducted, demonstrated its own commitment\nto democratic practices. (2000: 37)\n Reciprocity, argue the authors, implies another\ncommitment\u2014to \u201cthe economy of moral disagreement.\u201d\nCitizens must justify their positions by using the least controversial\nrationale available.  The principle of economy encourages those\nengaged in deliberation to look for justifying reasons that overlap\nwith rather than contradict beliefs held by others. To be morally\njustifiable under a conception of deliberative democracy, a truth\ncommission needs to economize on disagreement. An example of\neconomizing in the work of South Africa's TRC is the decision not to\ngrant blanket amnesties and to insist on the indictment of some of the\nworst perpetrators.\n\n\nThe proposed justification presents several difficulties. First, it\nassumes that a justification of truth commissions must meet the same\ndemands that justifications of existing democratic institutions need\nto satisfy. But a truth commission is not a democratic institution.\nRather, it is an institution that is meant to facilitate the\ntransition of a society to democracy. More often than not, countries\nundergoing such transitions lack a democratic tradition, have no\nhistory of significant public dialogue, and have not secured the\nminimal economic conditions required for meaningful political\nparticipation. Under these circumstances, expecting truth commissions\nto reflect and promote the ideals of deliberative democracy might be\ntoo ambitious.\n\n\nSecond, the justification is not specific enough. It is not clear why\ndeliberative democracy, and its accompanying attributes of reciprocity\nand minimizing disagreement, justify truth commissions any more than\nother transitional instruments. Thus, for example, a war crimes\ntribunal may generate as much public discussion as a truth commission,\nit may be based on reasons or principles as widely accessible as those\nunderlying a truth commission, and it may insist on trying only the\nworst offenders, thus economizing on moral disagreements. It seems, in\nother words, that the deliberative democracy-based argument justifies\nmore than one transitional policy.\n\n\nFinally, it is questionable whether the TRC can be justified through a\ndeliberative democracy rationale at all. The commission did not embody\na particularly open, deliberative stance in its operation.  Though\nmany of its hearings were public, some of the important procedures\nassociated with them were confidential by default. Thus, for example,\nthe proceedings of the amnesty commission were public, but the amnesty\napplications themselves, as well as the supporting documentation,\nremained confidential until declassified by the\ncommission. Furthermore, the commission was exempt from standard rules\nof legal procedure and evidence. Perpetrators named in the testimony\nof victims, or in the testimony of other perpetrators, were not given\nan opportunity to defend themselves; second-hand information, which a\ntraditional court would have disqualified as hearsay, was admitted,\netc. Now a commission making these sorts of exceptions to the precepts\nof procedural justice can still be justified (for example by showing\nthat these exceptions were necessary for establishing the chain of\nresponsibility leading to the higher ranks of government). But it is\ndoubtful whether the best way to justify it is by invoking a\nconception of deliberative democracy. For public deliberation to be\nmeaningful and substantial, strong protections of procedural justice\nmust be in place.  As mentioned previously, these were lacking in the\ncase of the TRC.\n3.2.2 Justice as Recognition\n\n\nA second justification holds that truth commissions, by focusing on\nvictims and providing them with the opportunity to tell their stories\nto a sympathetic forum, recognize victims as moral agents with stories\nworth telling. As Kiss (2000: 73) puts it,\n providing a platform for victims is one of the core\ntasks of truth commissions, not merely as a way of obtaining\ninformation but also from the standpoint of justice\u2026Those whose\nlives were shattered are entitled to have their suffering acknowledged\nand their dignity affirmed, to know that their \u201cpain is real and\nworthy of attention\u201d\u2026 We affirm the dignity and agency of\nthose who have been brutalized by attending to their voices and making\ntheir stories a part of the historical record.\n\n\nThe TRC did not adhere to the strict, skeptical approach to witnesses\nprevalent in law courts. Standard laws of evidence were\nrelaxed. Commissioners offered unusual gestures of acknowledgement\nsuch as rising when the witnesses entered the courtroom, visiting the\nsites of atrocities, and participating in public reburials (for more\ndetail see Kiss 2000: 73).  These practices were aimed at making the\nprocess about the victims of apartheid; witnesses were\nassumed to be speaking the truth, and were treated as people with\nvaluable tales to tell and lessons to teach.\n The justification of the TRC sketched above is a powerful one. A\ntransition from mass atrocity into civil society, if it is to be\nstable and lasting, requires that the value of the individual lives of\nan entire class\u2014the class of victims\u2014be affirmed. By\nallowing victims to testify in an uninterrupted manner, and by\ncreating a setting in which their testimonies were presumed to be\ntrue, the hearings of the TRC in South Africa went beyond establishing\nthe crimes of the security forces, or presenting the hardships of\neveryday life under apartheid. They also posited blacks, for the first\ntime, as persons whose stories ought to be heard with care and\nrespect. In other words, not only the content of the testimonies\nbefore the TRC was of significance; the mere act of blacks testifying\nwas transformative as well. The class of whites, the majority of whom\nhad supposed that a black man or woman cannot be the bearer of\nlegitimate, significant information, was made to think again.\n\n\nHowever, the argument from recognition raises a serious difficulty.\nSome victims argued that the restoration of their dignity requires\nthat those who hurt them be punished; that in order to feel worthy of\nrespect, they must know their injuries merit the criminal law's\nprotection. For such victims, dignity is manifested not by the\ncapacity to testify, but primarily by the commitment of the state to\napply its coercive power on their behalf. For some of us, in other\nwords, the currency of recognition is punishment rather than\nstorytelling; being recognized as a human being again can consist,\nfirst and foremost, in knowing that one is part of a civic zone\nprotected by law, where the use of violence against her is met with\nstrict sanctions. Under this understanding, the newfound capacity to\ntestify, even if combined with promises of future protection by the\nlaw, simply does not cut it.\n3.2.3 More truth\n Some defenders of truth commissions claim that these bodies are\nbetter than trials at producing comprehensive accounts of past abuses.\nThis superiority, they say, justifies compromises in retributive\njustice. In the case of the TRC, it was not only the dismissal of\nregular rules of evidence that allowed commissioners to unearth more\ninformation. The commission's amnesty-for-truth mechanism created an\nincentive for perpetrators to come forward. Once they started to do\nso, a domino effect resulted: offenders who were exposed in the\ntestimony of their colleagues rushed to testify lest they be indicted.\nFurthermore, since the commission was authorized to deny amnesty to\nanyone who had not provided \u201cfull disclosure\u201d, those who\ncame before it tried to give as much detail as they could.\n The \u201cmore truth\u201d justification is a strong one. Two\nobservations are, however, in order. First, as some critics of the TRC\nhave noted, its choice to focus on gross human rights\nviolations\u2014on dramatic stories of suffering, has obscured some\nof the institutional aspects of apartheid. Thus, the interconnections\nbetween business and the security forces, the wildly discriminatory\npractices of many work places and the support that many white media\noutlets lent authorities in masking the practices of apartheid were\nlargely overlooked by the commission's work. Insofar as these, too,\nare aspects of the truth, they were not revealed by the TRC.\n\n\nSecond, the fact that the TRC was the result of a political compromise\nmeant that there were some areas in which it treaded carefully. Some\nworm cans remained closed. In a recent book on the history of\napartheid, Terry Bell (2003: 4) mentions one remarkable example: as\nFredrick de Klerk, South Africa's last white leader, was heading for\nOslo to receive the Nobel peace prize in 1993, he ordered a strike on\na house allegedly housing militants from the Pan African Congress\nliberation group. A police death squad ended up killing five teenagers\nsleeping in a private home in the town of Umtata. The incident was\nnever investigated by the TRC.\n3.2.4 Forgiveness\n\n\nIt has become fashionable of late to speak about the importance of\nforgiveness in politics. Forgiveness is said to be the only\ndisposition that allows us to break free of the endless cycle of blow\nand counter blow characteristic of ethnic conflict. We are told that\nforgiving is our only chance to put to rest a tortured, complicated\nhistory of assaults and recriminations. One celebrated practitioner of\npolitical forgiveness, the Archbishop Desmond Tutu, called his book on\nSouth Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission No Future\nwithout Forgiveness. As the title suggests, Tutu argues that it\nis only by forgoing resentment and learning to forgive each other that\nSouth Africans could ever create a viable democracy. Can the prospects\nand benefits of forgiveness justify the tradeoff between truth and\n(retributive) justice involved in the TRC's\n work?[31]\n\n The most prevalent argument in favor of political forgiveness\nconcerns its potential to release victims and wrongdoers from the\neffects of vindictiveness. A desire for revenge can generate a\nnever-ending violent cycle, trapping both sides in a dynamic of blow\nand response, eventually destroying all those involved. As Gandhi\nfamously put it, \u201can eye for an eye can make the whole world\nblind.\u201d\n But forgiveness is not the only way to quell the desire for\nrevenge.  We can steer clear of revenge without forgiving. Victims\nmight seek legal rather than private justice. They might agree to\ninstitutionalize their vindictive passions through the use of the\ncourts. As Martha Minow (1998: 11) puts it, it is possible \u201cto\ntransfer the responsibilities for apportioning blame and punishment\nfrom victims to public bodies acting according to the rule of\nlaw.\u201d This is, in essence, the rationale behind the attempts to\nexpand the authority and centrality of the international criminal\ncourts in recent decades.\n\n\nVictims can (and very often do) simply move away from the scene of the\ntrauma rather than seek revenge or engage in forgiveness. In recent\nyears there has been a quiet exodus of approximately 100,000\nPalestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, to Europe and North\nAmerica. Most Holocaust survivors, uninterested in revenge or\nforgiveness, simply moved thousands of miles away from the sites of\ntheir horrific memories and swore never to set foot in the countries\nthat had persecuted them. Others replace revenge with commemoration,\ndedicating themselves to the creation and maintenance of monuments and\nmuseums. Thus, for example, many of those handing out the ID cards at\nthe Holocaust Museum in Washington D.C. are holocaust survivors, as\nare many of the guides in Jerusalem's Yad Vashem memorial.\n\n\nThe basic point, to reiterate, is this: vengeance can, indeed, be a\nvery dangerous thing. But one does not have to advocate forgiveness in\norder to avoid it. There are other ways to combat it, ways that might\nbe free of some of the complications (more on this below) associated\nwith forgiveness.\n\n\nMany commentators assume that forgiving is the exclusive prerogative\nof victims. On this view, it is problematic to define a process of\npolitical reconciliation in terms of forgiveness, because forgiving is\na very private business that cannot be promoted as a policy. While\nthis position is intuitively powerful, we will take a somewhat more\nnuanced stance. Let us call it the \u201cfading prerogative\u201d\nview: While forgiving is not exclusively up to victims, it certainly\nmakes less sense to talk about forgiveness the further away we move\nfrom the partly directly injured. If X gets hurt in a bus\nbombing, she might forgive the person who planned the attack. It can\nmake sense for her parents to forgive him too, though it is not\nobvious that they would be forgiving the same thing (the nature of the\nparents' injury is different from X's: the extent of her\nphysical pain was greater than theirs; the degree of their emotional\nanguish might have well been higher than hers). It would be more\nproblematic to speak of X's neighbors forgiving the bus bomber\nfor X's injuries, and even more problematic to speak of people\nwhom X has never met forgiving the bomber. Forgiveness, then,\nmight not be the exclusive prerogative of victims, but the entitlement\nto grant it certainly seems to fade as we move away from them. There\nis, in other words, a limited radius in which it makes sense to speak\nof forgiveness. This does not, of course, mean that we cannot think of\npolitical reconciliation in terms of forgiveness. It only means that\nsuch an approach would exclude a (potentially) significant part of the\ncommunity from the process.\n\n\nThere are other difficulties with making forgiveness into a political\ngoal. A policy encouraging victims to forgive those who have harmed\nthem risks adding insult to their injuries; it can induce a sense of\nmoral inadequacy on top of the devastation already suffered. A\nvictim's reaction to such a policy might run something like this:\n isn't it enough that I had to go through all this? Now\nyou are expecting me to forgive the person who did it? Now you are\nplacing the moral burden on me?\n Such a reaction suggests that demands for forgiveness might\nexacerbate rather than quell resentment\u2014both towards the\noffender, to whom the victim does not want to owe a moral debt, and\ntowards the state that makes such demands. Ironically, then, a policy\nadvocating forgiveness might undermine one of its own aims\u2014the\nreduction of vindictive and resentful passions after conflict.\n Finally, it is worth remembering that forgiveness is a deeply\nChristian notion. As J.G. Williams puts it: \u201cforgiveness is at\nthe religious, theological and ethical core of the Christian\ntradition\u201d (Rye et al. 2000: 31). The term does have an\nimportant role in both Judaism and Islam, but its status in these\nfaiths is more ambivalent. Thus, for example, while Judaism does,\nunder some conditions, impose a duty to forgive, it is not clear\nwhether this duty must be exercised towards non-Jews. Furthermore,\nJudaism, unlike Christianity, discourages unconditional\nforgiveness. Islamic doctrine does state that forgiveness is superior\nto revenge, but permits retributive practices, and even feuding under\nsome circumstances.  Unlike the famous Christian teaching encouraging\nthe turning of the other cheek, the Koran recommends a middle way\nbetween absolute vindictiveness and absolute forgiving. It reads:\n let harm be requited by an equal harm, though anyone\nwho forgives and puts things right will have his reward from God\nHimself--He does not like those who do wrong. (al-Shura 42:40)\n(Haleem, M., 2004))\n\n The Koran also makes a division between forgivable and unforgivable\n sins, mentioning the trespass of shirk\u2014the recognition\n of divinities other than Allah\u2014as a prime example of the latter\n category.  Finally, both Judaism and Islam allow for forgiveness\n without the resumption of relations between victim and offender,\n while Christianity insists that the possibility of full restoration\n of previous relations be left open.\n\n\nSince the demands and centrality of forgiveness vary between the\ndifferent faiths, it might be problematic to include the term as part\nof our notion of political reconciliation, especially in cases of\ninter-religious conflict. Even if the employment of the term were not\noffensive to anyone, it is likely that different religious parties\nwould be speaking of different things when they refer to forgiveness.\nThis, it strikes me, can create more confusion than benefit.\n4. Lustration\n4.1 Historical Background\nLustration is the process of regulating how former government\nofficials can participate in post-conflict government and social\nstructures. In particular, lustration involves the screening, barring,\nand removal of public officials from public positions in the new\ndemocratic system as a form of administrative justice.\nThe concept is based on the ancient Roman lustrum rituals, a\ncleansing or purification of an individual or community through the\nremoval of pollution. Lustration is often associated with the\ntransition from an authoritarian regime to democratic governance, and\nin particular with both the denazification of post-WWII Germany and\nthe post-communist transition to democracy in Eastern Europe following\nthe collapse of the Soviet Union. Lustration was originally\nimplemented as a part of the administrative reforms imposed by the\nAllies in post-WWII Germany and Japan, and by states in Western Europe\nthat were formerly occupied by the Nazi regime.\nFollowing the end of WWII, the Allies assigned themselves the task\nof purging all traces of Nazism from both German government and\nsociety, the first large-scale attempt at lustration in the modern\nera.  The Big Three Allies (the Soviet Union, United Kingdom, and\nUnited States) agreed on a plan of action to denazify Germany at the\nTripartite Conference in Potsdam. The Potsdam Agreement, released on\nAugust 2, 1945, set the groundwork for Allied efforts at purging\nNazism and its adherents from Germany. The Potsdam Agreement required\nthe Control Council (comprised of the four Allied Military Governors\nin occupied Germany) to\n\n destroy the National Socialist Party and its\naffiliated and supervised organizations, to dissolve all Nazi\ninstitutions, to ensure that they are not revived in any form, and to\nprevent all Nazi and military activity or\npropaganda. (II.A.3.iii)\n\n Furthermore, the subsequent Control Council Law No. 2 declared that\n the Nazi Party and all affiliates, totaling more than 60 specific\n organizations, were to be dismantled and outlawed.\nThe process of denazification, however, was not limited to the\ndestruction of Nazi organizations. The Potsdam Agreement also\nabolished all police organizations that monitored and controlled\npolitical activity for the Nazi Party and revoked all Nazi-era\nlegislation that established legally sanctioned \u201cdiscrimination\non the grounds of race, creed, or political opinion\u201d\n(II.A.4).\nOne of the most ambitious and wide-scale activities of the Control\nCouncil was the arrest of those involved with the National Socialist\nParty and its affiliates, and those who actively supported Nazism\nduring the war. The Allied arrest programs called for the automatic\ndetention of anyone associated with the Nazi police and security\nservices, officers holding the rank of major or higher in select\nbranches of the armed forces, high-ranking members of the Nazi Party,\nand high ranking members of the German\n government.[32]\n\nControversially, the Potsdam Agreement also called for the removal\nof Nazis from both \u201cpublic and semi-public office, and from\npositions of responsibility in important private undertakings\u201d\n(II.A.6). Although this policy was both harsh and ambitious, it meshed\nwith the Allied goal of both destroying the National Socialist Party\nand ensuring that it is \u201cnot revived in any form\u201d\n(II.A.3.iii). The process of denazification also included the\nconfiscation of all wealth and property associated with Nazi\norganizations and high-ranking Nazi officials, and a complete purging\nof the educational system of all Nazis, Nazi materials, and\nobjectionable courses. The Allied military government also prohibited\nthe display of Nazi \u201cuniforms and insignia, salutes, medals,\nanthems, and music\u201d (Plischke 1947), a policy that remained in\nforce even after political control was returned to the Germans.\nDespite the enormous amount of resources and energy devoted to the\ndenazification of Germany, there were several problems associated with\nthe process. One of the biggest impediments to the complete\ndenazification of post-WWII Germany was the lack of qualified\nanti-Nazis to staff the government, and in particular the court system\nresponsible for trying ex-Nazis. The shortage of qualified\nprofessionals with \u201cclean records\u201d, combined with\ninterference from German officials and indifference from American\nofficers, led to disappointment among many of those tasked with\nensuring the complete removal of Nazism and its adherents from\n German\ngovernment.[33]\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union and their emergence as\nindependent nation-states, the states that made up the former\nCzechoslovakia practiced lustration as a method of transitional\njustice. In 1991, the Czech and Slovak National Assembly passed a law\nprohibiting former Communist Party officials, members of the People's\nMilitia, and members of the National Security Corps from holding a\nwide range of elected and civil service positions in the new\ngovernment for five years (until January 30,\n 1996);[34]\n the ban was later\nextended an additional five years. \n In Hungary, a 1991 law attempted to reset the stature of\nlimitations on crimes committed during the period of Communist rule\n(1944\u20131990).  Hungary's Constitutional Court overturned this\nlaw. The Court later approved an amended bill, which labeled the\nrepression of 1956 as \u201cwar crimes\u201d and \u201ccrimes\nagainst humanity\u201d, both of which carry no finite statute of\nlimitations. On 9 March 1994, during the immediate run-up to national\nelections, the Hungarian Parliament passed a lustration ordinance that\nplaced roughly 12,000 \u201cofficials\u201d under review in an\nattempt to discover who among them had collaborated with the secret\npolice during the Communist period. This list contained\nParliamentarians, high-ranking government officials, top officials at\nthe Hungarian National bank, ambassadors, generals, top media\noperatives, police, university officials and professors, judges, state\nattorneys, editors, directors of state agencies and banks, and\nadministrators of other sundry financial and governmental institutions\n(Ellis 1996).\n\n\nTwo panels were charged with screening suspects by investigating their\nsecret files. The investigative period was to last six years and\nresults will remain secret for thirty years. Several elements of this\nlaw were found unconstitutional in March 1994, and the Parliament\npassed a new law on July 3, 1996, which provides for the screening of\nall individuals born prior to 14 February 1972 before the assumption\nof higher office. Former agents and officials of the internal security\nservices were the target. If the lustrated official did not resign\nwithin thirty days, the results of the investigation would be released\npublicly, bringing public humiliation into play as a tool of\nlustration.\n\n\nThe demise of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) in 1990, and\nits annexation by West Germany, resulted in its\n\u201ccolonization\u201d by administrators, bureaucrats, and jurists\nfrom West Germany. This was partly due to the manner in which\nre-unification took place (de facto annexation), but was also\nthe result of the complete inadequacy of the existing East German\ncivil service in the face of the new demands of a capitalist\nsociety. This \u201ccolonization\u201d and the imposition of the\npolitical and legal judgment of another country, a former foe, sets\nthe East German lustration apart from other such processes in\npost-Socialist Europe.\n It was necessary to supply the new West German government with\nmoral and political legitimacy in the former states of East\nGermany. This demanded the prosecution of past crimes under the prior\nregime, but also a purge of Communists and Stasi collaborators from\nthe civil service. No post-Communist country has yet devised a\nlustration scheme with the golden balance addressing these two\ncompeting needs. East Germany was no exception, despite\u2014or\nperhaps because of\u2014the rigor with which lustration was\npursued.\n\n\nThe ambiguities in the definition of collaboration (in cases of\ncollaboration, forced collaboration, pseudo-compliance, clandestine\nresistance, etc.) resulted in similar difficulties in the lustration\npurge, whose terms were defined in the EinigVrt (the Treaty of\nUnification) (Blankenburg 1995). West German civil servants and\nlawyers largely conducted the purge and the construction of new\ninstitutions in East Germany. East German lawyers were both unfamiliar\nwith the new legal system and suspect in the eyes of the new\nauthorities. The non-indigenous nature of the process was a major\nproblem both in fact and public perception. The scope of the\nlustration and the system's ability to delineate individual\nresponsibility for the Communist regime's repression were both\ncriticized (Blankenburg 1995).\n The Treaty of Unification dealt with the union of both legal and\npolitical systems. Public employees would be scrutinized to determine\nif they were politically and ideologically fit for\nreemployment. Forced to reapply for their positions, public employees\nfaced rejection if Stasi or other untoward associations were\ndiscovered. They also faced criminal trial if their offenses were\ndeemed prosecutable by the reconstituted court system. Most trials\nwere therefore conducted by new West German\u2014or more rarely,\npre-screened East German\u2014judges under East German criminal\nlaw. These trials were meant to bring public humiliation to the\nconvicted.\n\n\nThe former leadership of the DDR was tried in courts in West Berlin.\nAreas of investigation by the new authorities included: commanders\nresponsible for the DDR's border policy (\u201cshoot to kill\u201d),\nelection fraud at various levels of governance, and charges of\ncorruption, embezzlement, and \u201cmisuse of public funds\u201d\n(Blankenburg 1995). The prosecution took on a hybrid form: the\nsuspects had to be tried according to the criminal law of East Germany\n(which West German jurists considered an Unrechtsstaat) but\nwith the procedures of West German courts. The intent was to\ncriminalize the Communist regime by treating and prosecuting its\nleadership according to the rules of an ordinary West German criminal\ntrial.\n In the aftermath of the Iraq War of 2003, the Bush administration\npursued a policy of \u201cde-Baathification\u201d as a means of\npurging the government of Saddam supporters and collaborators. In\ncontrast to previous lustration efforts following WWII and the\ncollapse of the Soviet Union, the U.S. government initially indicated\nthat a large number of bureaucrats and officials would be retained in\nthe post-Saddam government (de Young and Slevin 2003).  However, the\nscope of the United States' de-Baathification efforts would soon\nexpand well beyond that initially limited scope\n\n\nThe U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) ultimately required\na governmental purge of all Baath party members, although there were\nexemptions provided to certain local coalitions. Senior Baath party\nofficials were forbidden from entering the entire post-Saddam\nadministration, while ordinary members were prevented from entering\nthe top levels of government, thereby ensuring that the top levels of\ngovernment remained completely Baath-free (David 2006: 366). In\naddition, Iraq's military and police services were completely\ndisbanded (see Yaphe 2004), leaving large numbers of trained military\npersonnel without work or purpose.\n\n\nSeveral problems emerged from the U.S. policy of total\nde-Baathification. By excluding so many citizens who had formerly held\npower from government, the CPA ultimately excluded and marginalized a\nlarge swath of the Iraqi population from both governance and the\neconomy; an estimated 60\u201375 percent of those purged were\nunemployed by late 2003 (see The Economist 2003 and David\n2006). To make matters worse, many of those excluded were former\nmilitary and police personnel who were seasoned combat veterans that\nnow sought to turn their military training against the U.S.-led forces\noverseeing the reconstruction and democratization of Iraq.\n\n\nAs a result of the purge of Baath part members throughout the entire\nIraqi government, the CPA was faced with a shortage of qualified\npersonnel to staff the new administration, military, and police forces\n(David 2006: 367). This lack of qualified personnel, combined with\nintensifying attacks against both coalition and administration targets\nand the subsequent difficulty recruiting workers, deeply impacted the\nability of the still-forming government to function. These flaws,\nwhich ultimately obstructed efforts to stabilize Iraq and contributed\nto the large number of causalities caused by insurgents, will be\ndiscussed in greater detail below.\n4.2 Criticisms of Lustration\nLustration policies are often bogged down by the paradoxical nature\nof public trust during a political transition. A strong rationale for\nengaging in administrative purges is to signal that a political\ntransition is real and that the authoritarian past is being put to\nrest. Officials responsible for a transition want to signal that the\nemerging democratic polity will operate differently from its corrupt\nand dangerous predecessor. Such signaling is achieved, inter\nalia, by displacing those who were responsible for administering\nthe corrupt and vicious policies of the past. And surely, public trust\ndoes depend on communicating to ordinary citizens that a fresh\npolitical start has been made\u2014that a new and lawful polity has\nbeen launched. On the other hand, public trust also depends on the\nfunctionality and competence of government. The trains need to run,\nlicenses need to be issued or renewed, roads need to be maintained,\nand public order has to be kept. And if the bureaucratic class that\nknows how to do these things is subtracted from post war politics\nbecause of how it behaved under the previous regime, the daily\noperation of government is likely to suffer. And public trust is\nlikely to tumble accordingly (this is when we begin to hear that\n\u201cat least under Saddam the trains ran on time\u201d, etc.) The\nfirst dilemma of lustration,then, concerns its scope: how does one\nlustrate enough so that public trust (and retributive justice) are\nserved, without lustrating so much that the organs of government are\nundone and public trust is lost as a\n result?[35]\n\n\n\nIt goes without saying that different countries face different\npolitical circumstances when it comes to how much lustration they can\ncarry out: East Germany could afford to purge its civil service rather\nseverely, due to the availability of replacements from the West. Other\nnations, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia, did not have this luxury\nand had often to prioritize stability due to the exigencies and\ninherent dangers of the initial transition period.\nAnother complication impacting the scope of lustration arises from\nthe difficulty in fixing degrees of guilt under totalitarian regimes.\nHere the problem is not so much lustrating in a way that maintains\npublic trust but, rather, figuring out what counts, philosophically,\nas the appropriate degree of guilt to justify lustration in the first\nplace. Mid-level officials in a ruling party mechanism cannot be\nautomatically labeled as enthusiastic or even willing supporters of\nthe machinery of oppression. Some were, some passively found their way\ninto their roles and still others were coerced into them. A morally\nlegitimate policy of lustration must take into account such gradations\nof\n guilt.[36]\n\nBut the ability to determine degrees of culpability requires\nexpensive, lengthy investigations which are often beyond the means of\nthose orchestrating a transition.\n\n\nBeyond these problems of scope lies an epistemological difficulty:\nLustration purges and exclusions frequently, though not always, rely\non testimonials and security service files which are often of dubious\naccuracy. The files are often rife with human error, exaggerations,\nand omissions. The most valuable Communist informants and\ncollaborators were often missing from surviving secret police files\n(many were destroyed or \u201cdisappeared\u201d, probably into KGB\npossession) or were shielded during the process (Minow\n 2000).[37]\n On the other hand,\nemployees of the security services often embellished their accounts\nand added false informants in the period before an audit so that they\ncould meet or exceed their prescribed\n quota.[38]\n\n5. Forgetting\n\n\nHaving examined, in some detail, three of the most important ways in\nwhich nations can come to terms with their past, it is perhaps fitting\nto conclude this entry by considering the possibility that nations do\nnot attempt such a reckoning. Is there anything to be said for\nforgetting in the aftermath of war? Is there an argument to recommend\namnesia as the basis of a political transition? (for a detailed\ntreatment see Rotondi and Eisikovits, forthcoming). \n\n\nMost often, forgetting cannot serve as the basis for peacemaking. It\nis destructive on both the individual and collective levels. It\ncompounds the suffering of individuals by forcing them to watch their\ntormentors walk around freely, reenter politics, or maintain their\nposts in public service and the military. All of this takes place\nwhile their own painful memories and traumas remain unacknowledged.\nFurthermore, policies advocating forgetfulness decrease the chances\nthat victims will be compensated for their suffering. The most common\ninstitutional products of such policies are laws granting amnesty.\nTypically, under such amnesties, perpetrators are protected from both\ncriminal charges and civil liability. Amanda Pike, a reporter for PBS'\nFrontline, tells a story which starkly demonstrates the cost of\nforgetfulness for individual victims. During a trip through the\nCambodian province of Pailin, Pike came across Samrith Phum, whose\nhusband was executed by the Khmer Rouge. Phum knows the murderer well.\nHe is her neighbor and he operates a noodle shop across the street\nfrom her house. He was never arrested and never charged with her\nhusband's murder. There is no procedure through which he can be sued\nfor damages.  Phum must simply get used to the idea that her husband's\nkiller quietly manages his store next door (Pike 2002).\n\n\nOn the national level, a government advocating forgetfulness commits\nthe political correlate of suicide: it undermines the ability of the\ngroup of people it governs to call itself a nation. The French thinker\nErnest Renan (1882) defined a nation as consisting of\n two things, which, in truth, are really just\none\u2026One is in the past, the other in the present. One is the\npossession in common of a rich legacy of memories; the other is\ncurrent consent, the desire to live together, the willingness to\ncontinue to maintain the value of the heritage that one has received\nas a common possession.\n\nForgetting destroys both elements. It undermines the possibility of a\ncommon history by excluding an entire class of memories. At the same\ntime, it obliterates the desire of formerly hostile parties to live\ntogether, or the possibility of social solidarity, by creating a\nbubbling, poisonous, pool of resentment among an entire group of\n\n people.[39]\n\n Now Renan was far from na\u00efve. He admits that\n\u201cforgetting\u201d and perhaps even \u201chistorical\nerror\u201d are essential in the creation of national identity. Later\nhe adds that \u201cthe essence of a nation is that all individuals\nhave many things in common and also that they have forgotten many\nthings.\u201d Descriptively, he is surely right. Heroic\nhistoriography and intentional forgetting was instrumental in creating\nAmerican, Israeli, Turkish, Spanish, and French contemporary\nidentities, to mention but a few. But identities based on amnesia are\nrarely stable.  Israel's new historians, the countless young Armenians\nlobbying parliaments all over the world to recognize the Armenian\ngenocide almost a century after it took place, and the recent Spanish\n\u201cHistorical Memory Law\u201d (2007) all attest that it is\ndifficult to simply bury the past. If the groups that have been\nforgotten are not annihilated, their painful memories continue to\nfester until they eventually erupt in renewed conflict.\n\n\nBut what if all parties involved in a conflict really want to forget?\nWhat if there is a tacit or explicit agreement not to dwell on the\npast? What are we to make of Mozambique, for example, where in the\naftermath of a long, bloody civil war, the combatants actively elected\nnot to address past atrocities? In her superb book on truth\ncommissions, Hayner (2002) describes an election rally in post-war\nMozambique in which a candidate was literally chased out of a hall for\nbringing up the conflict. Can we really make a normative argument for\nremembering if both sides freely chose to forget? One possible way to\nmake such an argument is by analogy. It is quite clear to us that, in\nthe domestic context, the fact that two sides to a conflict agree to\nbury the hatchet does not preclude their prosecution by the criminal\njustice authorities. Thus, if two neighboring families become\nentangled in a massive brawl, during which property on both sides is\ndestroyed, and some injuries are sustained, the District Attorney's\noffice may decide to issue indictments, even if all of those who did\nthe fighting would like to put the whole incident behind them. The\ncriminal law is not a private matter completely at the discretion of\ncitizens. The public has a stake in upholding the criminal law, and is\nunderstood to be an interested party whenever it is broken. After all,\nin the example provided above, wider interests were compromised:\ntraffic may have been disturbed by the fighting, the small children of\nother neighbors may have been watching, publicly funded hospitals may\nhave been called on to treat the injured, reports of the fight may\nhave made their way into the news media bringing down house prices,\netc. In short, the fight, almost any fight, has repercussions for\nthird parties. That is why, in important ways, such fights are\neveryone's business. And that is why criminal cases are typically\ntitled Commonwealth vs. Jones rather than Smith vs.  Jones.\n\n\nIs there an analogous argument to be made about the aftermath of\npolitical conflict? Are there any third party interests that may\njustify some kind of reckoning with mass atrocity, even if all of\nthose involved would freely choose to put the past behind them? Fully\nanswering this question is beyond the scope of this entry, so we shall\nsimply gesture at some of the difficulties that need to be addressed\nin order to do justice to it.\n\n\nFirst, who are the third parties whose interests are implicated by a\ndecision on the part of two warring parties to bury the past? Could we\nargue that, given the intense media coverage given to political\nconflicts, a failure to address massive violations of human rights in\nlocation X (for whatever reason) may endanger human rights in\nlocation Y (by, say, bolstering the confidence of would be\nperpetrators)? If so the third party could be described, vaguely, as\nthe international community, a community with a serious interest in\ncreating a robust culture of human rights wherein violations are\ndocumented and addressed rather than simply ignored.\n\n\nSecond, even if we agree that there are interested third parties in\nthe international context, how could such parties ensure that their\ninterests are protected? What sort of enforcement power do they have?\nHere the answers are both legal and political. The nascent\nInternational Criminal Court may be used in cases where its authority\ncomes into play. Perhaps more significantly, the international\ncommunity (or, more specifically, the most powerful international\nplayers) may resort to political pressure. After all, countries such\nas Mozambique, emerging from prolonged wars, are desperately dependent\non international aid. Donor countries could, accordingly, make aid\ncontingent on the addressing of past atrocities.\n When all is said and done, it appears that the main difference\nbetween the domestic and international cases has to do with the\nconsequences of the decision whether to use the courts. While in the\ndomestic arena a failure to prosecute can result in increased cynicism\nabout the law (and eventually in a weakening of the rule of law),\nimposing accountability in the aftermath of war may, under some\ncircumstances, reignite violence. Insisting on doing justice in such\ncases recalls Lord Mansfield's famous dictum in the 1772 Somerset\ncase: that justice must be done \u201cthough the heavens may\nfall.\u201d The trouble, of course, with this Kantian pronouncement\nis that there is no one to reap the fruits of justice after the\nheavens have fallen.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abrahamsen, T. &amp; H. van der Merwe, 2005, \u201cReconciliation\nthrough Amnesty?
