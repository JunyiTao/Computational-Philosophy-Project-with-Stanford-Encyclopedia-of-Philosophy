    "main_text": "\n\n\nBertrand Russell (1872\u20131970) described his philosophy as a kind of\n\u201clogical atomism\u201d, by which he meant to endorse both a metaphysical\nview and a certain methodology for doing philosophy. The metaphysical\nview amounts to the claim that the world consists of a plurality of\nindependently existing things exhibiting qualities and standing in\nrelations. According to logical atomism, all truths are ultimately\ndependent upon a layer of atomic facts, which consist either of a\nsimple particular exhibiting a quality, or multiple simple particulars\nstanding in a relation. The methodological view recommends a process of\nanalysis, whereby one attempts to define or reconstruct more complex\nnotions or vocabularies in terms of simpler ones. This process often reveals\nthat what we take to be brute necessities are instead purely logical. According to Russell,\nat least early on during his logical atomist phase, such an analysis\ncould eventually result in a language containing only words\nrepresenting simple particulars, the simple properties and relations\nthereof, and logical constants, which, despite this limited vocabulary,\ncould adequately capture all truths. \n\n Russell\u2019s logical atomism had a profound influence on analytic\nphilosophy in the first half of the 20th century; indeed, it is\narguable that the very name \u201canalytic philosophy\u201d derives from\nRussell\u2019s defense of the method of analysis. \n",
