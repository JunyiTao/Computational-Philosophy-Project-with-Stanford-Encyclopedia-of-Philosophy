    "main_text": "Life and works\n1. Life and works\n\nBergson was born in Paris on October 18, 1859; he was the second of\nseven children of a Polish Father and English mother; both of his\nparents were Jewish. Bergson was a notably exceptional pupil\nthroughout his childhood. Like his German contemporary, Edmund\nHusserl, Bergson\u2019s original training was in mathematics. Bergson\nwon the first prize in mathematics for the prestigious \u201cConcours\nG\u00e9n\u00e9ral,\u201d which led to the publication of his\nsolution to a problem by Pascal in 1877. Bergson nevertheless chose to\nprepare for the \u00c9cole Normale in the letters and humanities\nsection. His math teacher, disappointed, famously claimed, \u201cyou\ncould have been a mathematician; you will be a mere philosopher\u201d\n(quoted in Soulez & Worms 2002, p. 35).\n\nIn 1878, Bergson became a French citizen, although he could have\nchosen English citizenship. He was accepted at the \u00c9cole\nNormale along with Jean Jaur\u00e8s and \u00c9mile Durkheim. He\ndiscovered Herbert Spencer with enthusiasm, and studied under\nF\u00e9lix Ravaisson and Jules Lachelier. Bergson graduated from the\n\u00c9cole Normale in 1881. He was the second best at the highly\nselective Agr\u00e9gation de Philosophie, thanks to a lecture\nentitled \u201cWhat is the value of contemporary psychology?\u201d\nHe began a teaching post in Angers at the high school (the\nlyc\u00e9e), and then moved to Clermont-Ferrand. There he taught\nboth at the Lyc\u00e9e and the University for the next five\nyears.\n\nHis first scholarly publication was in 1886, in the Revue\nPhilosophique; \u201cOn Unconscious Simulation in States of\nHypnosis\u201d concerns the results of his observations at sessions\nof hypnosis. Notice that Freud and Breuer\u2019s Studies on\nHysteria did not appear until 1896. This foreshadowed\nBergson\u2019s growing interest in the role of unconscious memories\nwithin recognition\u2014an interest that culminates in his being\nelected president of the London based Society for Psychical Research\nin 1913. In 1888, Bergson submitted two doctoral theses in Paris:\nEssai sur les donn\u00e9es imm\u00e9diates de la conscience,\npublished as a book (Time and Free Will) in 1889; and the\nthen required Latin thesis, Quid Aristoteles de loco senserit\n(Aristotle\u2019s Conception of Place). In 1927, in a\nfootnote to Being and Time, Heidegger cited this second\nthesis, claiming that Bergson\u2019s view of time remains within the\nhorizon of Greek metaphysics.\n\nBergson\u2019s second book, Matter and Memory, appeared in\n1896. This book led to Bergson\u2019s election to the Coll\u00e8ge\nde France. In his second attempt, Bergson succeeded at obtaining a\npost, and teaches at the \u00c9cole Normale for two years starting\nin 1898 (Soulez et Worms, 2002, pp. 80\u201381). The Dreyfus Affair\nwas raging, but Bergson (a Jew by birth) refused to take part in the\npublic debate. Bergson published Laughter: an Essay on the Meaning\nof the Comic in 1900. He was appointed Chair of Ancient\nPhilosophy at the prestigious Coll\u00e8ge de France. This marked\nthe beginning of his growing fame. In 1903, Bergson published, in the\nprestigious Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale, an article\nentitled \u201cIntroduction to Metaphysics\u201d (later reproduced\nas the centerpiece of The Creative Mind [La Pens\u00e9e\net le mouvant] in 1934). The first of Bergson\u2019s works to be\ntranslated in many languages, this article not only became a crucial\nreading guide for Bergson\u2019s philosophy as a whole, but it also\nmarked the beginning of \u201cBergsonism\u201d and of its influence\non Cubism and literature. Through Williams James\u2019s enthusiastic\nreading of this essay, Bergsonism acquired a far-reaching influence on\nAmerican Pragmatism. Moreover, his imprint on American literature (in\nparticular, Wallace Stevens and Willa Cather, who created a character\ncalled \u201cAlexandra Bergson\u201d) is undeniable.\n\nCreative Evolution appeared in 1907 and was not only the\nsource of the \u201cBergson legend,\u201d as well as of numerous,\nlively academic and public controversies centering on his philosophy\nand his role as an intellectual. The beginning of the next decade is\nthe apex of the \u201cBergsonian cult\u201d (\u201cle Bergson\nboom\u201d). Creative Evolution was translated into English.\nBertrand Russell (who publishes an article entitled \u201cThe\nPhilosophy in Bergson\u201d in The Monist in 1912) objected\nthat Bergson wants to turn us into bees with the notion of intuition.\nRussell also noted that any attempt at classifying Bergson would fail,\nas his philosophy cuts across all divisions, whether empiricist,\nrealist or idealist (Soulez et Worms 2002, p. 124). Bergson\u2019s\nlectures at the Coll\u00e8ge de France were filled to capacity, not\nonly with society ladies and their suitors, but also with a whole\ngeneration of philosophy students (\u00c9tienne Gilson and Jean Wahl\namong others) and poets such as T.S. Eliot.\n\nIn January 1913, Bergson visited the United States for the first time\n(Soulez et Worms 2002, p. 134). The week before he delivered his first\nlecture at Columbia University (entitled \u201cSpirituality and\nLiberty\u201d), The New York Times published a long article on him.\nThe enthusiasm this article generated may explain the traffic jam that\noccurred before Bergson\u2019s lecture, the first traffic jam in the\nhistory of Broadway. In the same year, Bergson gave the Presidential\nAddress, entitled \u201cPhantasms of the Living and Psychical\nResearch,\u201d to the Society for Psychical Research in London,\nEngland. The next year Bergson was elected a member of the\nAcad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise; he was the first Jewish member in\nits history. He also presented courses at the Coll\u00e8ge de France\non Modern Philosophy and Spinoza. His international fame continued to\ngrow through the delivery of the Gifford Lecture at Edinburgh\nUniversity in Scotland in May and June; the lectures were called\n\u201cThe Problem of Personality.\u201d Finally, in the same year,\nthe Roman Catholic Church, in opposition to evolutionary theory,\ncondemned Bergson\u2019s philosophy.\n\nOf course, in the middle of this decade, war broke out, and Bergson\nentered his political career, which took him first to Spain in 1917\n(Soulez et Worms 2002, p.150). But more importantly, the French\ngovernment sent him to the United-States as a diplomatic emissary to\nmeet President Wilson (Soulez et Worms 2002, p. 154; see also Soulez\n1989). After his first visit to the United States in 1913, he had\nthought that peace would come only from Washington, D.C. (Soulez et\nWorms 2002, p. 139). After his visit to Washington, Bergson said,\n\u201cI have just lived unforgettable hours. Humanity appeared to me\ntransfigured. [\u2026] France was saved. It was the greatest joy of\nmy life.\u201d At this time, Bergson was also working with\nWilson\u2019s government to form a \u201cleague of nations,\u201d a\nbody that would include representatives of all nations and that would\naim at establishing and maintaining peace. The League of Nations\nremained in existence until 1946, when it was replaced by the United\nNations.\u00a0 Increasingly Bergson became more famous for his\npolitical actions than for his philosophy.\n\n1919 saw the publication of Bergson\u2019s Mind Energy, a\ncollection of essays concerned with metaphysical and psychological\nproblems. During the same year he retired from his teaching duties.\nHowever, in 1922, Bergson was appointed president of the International\nCommission for Intellectual Cooperation \u2014 the precursor to\nUNESCO. There, Bergson participated in a debate with Einstein, which,\naccording to Merleau-Ponty, seems to testify to a \u201ccrisis of\nreason.\u201d\u00a0 Bergson published his reflections on Einstein as\nDuration and Simultaneity (see M\u00e9langes,\n1972). There is some controversy surrounding this book. Bergson\nallowed the book to be reprinted up to the sixth edition in 1931.\nHowever \u00c9douard Le Roy claims in a letter from 1953 (well after\nBergson\u2019s death) that he often spoke with Bergson about\nrelativity. Le Roy says, \u201c[Bergson] added with insistence that\nthe defective state of his knowledge of mathematics did not allow him\nto follow the development of generalized relativity in the detail such\na development required. Consequently [Bergson] thought it wiser to let\nthe question drop. This is why he refused to let Duration and\nSimultaneity be reprinted\u201d (Avertissement pour la\nsepti\u00e8me edition, Dur\u00e9e et\nsimultan\u00e9it\u00e9, p. 5, [Lawlor translation]). However,\nin Bergson\u2019s will, he does not mention Duration and\nSimultaneity as a text not to be republished. Thus, the editors\nof the seventh edition in 1968 (Jean Wahl, Henri Gouhier, Jean Gutton,\nVladimir Jank\u00e9l\u00e9vitch) saw fit to reprint this book. In\na letter from November 1924, after complaining that in general his\nwritings on relativity had been badly understood by the\n\u201crelativist physicists.\u201d Bergson clarifies that his\nwritings on relativity should not be seen as dismissive of relativity\ntheory. He says, \u201cFor my part, I think that the theory of\nrelativity represents a very great advance, not only from the\nviewpoint of physics, but also from the viewpoint of philosophy\u201d\n(Bergson, Correspondences, p. 1122 [Lawlor translation]). If\nDeleuze\u2019s interpretation is correct, the confrontation that\nDuration and Simultaneity develops is not one between Bergson\nand Einstein but a confrontation between Bergson\u2019s\ninterpretation of multiplicities and Riemann\u2019s interpretation of\nmultiplicity, Riemann\u2019s interpretation being, according to\nDeleuze, the basis of Einstein\u2019s theory (Deleuze, 1991, pp.\n39\u201340, and also see below, \u201cThe Concept of\nMultiplicity\u201d).\n\nDuring the second half of the Twenties, Bergson suffered from severe\narthritis, which eventually forced him to retire from public life. In\n1928, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. Finally, in 1932,\nhe surprised everyone with the publication of his last major book,\nThe Two Sources of Morality and Religion, which gave rise to\nrenewed debates and misunderstandings about his philosophy and his\nreligious orientation. The final collection of his essays, The\nCreative Mind, appeared in 1934.\n\nBergson died on January 3, 1941 at the age of 81. World War II had of\ncourse already begun, and Germany, occupying France, had established\nthe Vichy government. There is a rumor that he had converted to\nCatholicism near the end of his life, but there is no document to\nsupport this rumor. In fact, in a letter to Emmanuel Mounier, Madame\nBergson quotes her husband saying \u201cI would have converted [to\nCatholicism], if I had not seen over many years the great wave of\nanti-semitism preparing itself to expand over the world.\u201d Madame\nBergson continues in the letter to say that her husband had resolved\nnot to be baptized (B\u00e9guin and Th\u00e9venaz 1941, pp.\n11\u201312; also Soulez and Worms, p. 277). Because of his fame, the\nVichy Government offered Bergson exemptions from anti-Semitic\nregulations, but he refused. It is also rumored that he contracted the\ncold that killed him while waiting in line to register as a Jew.\nApparently, in the same will which his wife mentions in the letter to\nMounier (B\u00e9guin and Th\u00e9venaz 1941, p. 12), Bergson had\ninstructed that all of his papers be destroyed. The story goes that\nhis wife obeyed this order, throwing all of her husband\u2019s papers\ninto the fireplace. There is a rumor that she destroyed a half-written\nmanuscript. The result of this destruction is that the Bergson\nArchives in Paris (stored at Librairie Jacques Doucet on the Place de\nPanth\u00e9on in Paris) contain only Bergson\u2019s personal\nlibrary. So, the situation is very different for Bergson than for many\nother important French and German philosophers of the 20th Century who\nhave massive archives (Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty). The\nlack of archival material is one reason why Bergson went out of favor\nduring the second half of the Twentieth Century. We shall return to\nthis problem of Bergson\u2019s temporary disappearance from the\nphilosophical scene.\n",
