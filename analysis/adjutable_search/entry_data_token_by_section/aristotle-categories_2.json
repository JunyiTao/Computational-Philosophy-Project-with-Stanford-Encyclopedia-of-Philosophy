    "main_text": "The Four-Fold Division || Not Said-Of and Present-In\n1.2 Not Said-Of and Present-In\n\nIf we continue to understand the said-of and present-in distinctions\nas I have characterized them, we will also find that Aristotle thinks\nthat in addition to particulars in the category of substance there are\naccidental, or what we can now call non-substantial,\nparticulars. Aristotle\u2019s example of such an entity is an\nindividual piece of grammatical knowledge (1a25). Perhaps a more\nintuitive example is the particular whiteness that some object has. If\nthere are non-substantial particulars, then Socrates\u2019 whiteness\nis a numerically distinct particular from Plato\u2019s whiteness.\nContemporary metaphysicians might call such entities tropes, and such\na label is acceptable as long as one is careful not to expect\nAristotle\u2019s theory to resemble too much contemporary trope\ntheories. In the first instance, if Aristotle does accept the\nexistence of non-substantial particulars, he certainly does not think\nthat they can exist apart from primary substances \u2014 indeed, it\nis most natural to interpret Aristotle on this point as thinking that\na non-substantial particular is a dependent entity, individuated only\nby reference to the primary substance that it is present in. Hence,\nSocrates\u2019 whiteness cannot exist without Socrates. Moreover,\nthinking of such entities as standing in a primitive relation of\nresemblance to one another is quite foreign to Aristotle\u2019s way\nof thinking. Nonetheless, if the present interpretation is correct,\nAristotle did accept what are appropriately called particularized\nproperties.\n",
