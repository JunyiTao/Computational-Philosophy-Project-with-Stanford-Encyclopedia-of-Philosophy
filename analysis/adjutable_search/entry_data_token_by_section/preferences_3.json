    "main_text": "Preference logic || Transitivity\n2.3 Transitivity\n\nBy far the most discussed logical property of preferences is the\nfollowing:\n\n\\[\nA\\succcurlyeq B \\wedge B\\succcurlyeq C \\rightarrow A\\succcurlyeq C\n\\quad\\text{(transitivity of weak preference)}\n\\]\n\n\nThe corresponding properties of the other two relations are defined\nanalogously:\n\n\\[\nA\\sim B \\wedge B\\sim C \\rightarrow A\\sim C\n\\quad\\text{(transitivity of indifference)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nA\\succ B \\wedge B\\succ C \\rightarrow A\\succ C\n\\quad\\text{(transitivity of strict preference)}\n\\]\n\n\nA weak preference relation \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) is\ncalled quasi-transitive if its strict part \\(\\succ\\) is\ntransitive.\n\nMany other properties have been defined that are related to\ntransitivity. The following three are among the most important of\nthese:\n\n\n\\(A\\sim B \\wedge B\\succ C \\rightarrow A\\succ C\n\\quad\\text{(IP-transitivity)}\\)\n\n\\(A\\succ B \\wedge B\\sim C \\rightarrow A\\succ C\n\\quad\\text{(PI-transitivity)}\\)\n\nThere is no series \\(A_1 ,\\ldots ,A_n\\) of alternatives such that\n\\(A_1 \\succ \\ldots \\succ A_n\\succ A_1\\) \n\\(\\text{(acyclicity)}\\)\n\n\nAll of these are ways of weakening the transitivity of \\(\\succcurlyeq\\). Thus, if \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) satisfies transitivity then \\(\\succ\\) and \\(\\sim\\)\nare also transitive, and furthermore, IP-transitivity, PI-transitivity\nand acyclicity hold.\n\nFurthermore, if \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) is transitive, then no cycles\ncontaining \\(\\succ\\) are possible, i.e. there are no \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nsuch that \\(A\\succcurlyeq *B\\succ A\\). Preferences with such a\n\\(\\succ\\)-containing cycle are called cyclic preferences.\n\nTransitivity is a controversial property, and many examples have been\noffered to show that it does not hold in general. A classic type of\ncounterexample to transitivity is the so-called Sorites Paradox. It\nemploys a series of objects that are so arranged that we cannot\ndistinguish between two adjacent members of the series, whereas we can\ndistinguish between members at greater distance (Armstrong 1939,\nArmstrong 1948, Luce 1956). Consider 1000 cups of coffee, numbered\n\\(C_0, C_1, C_2,\\ldots\\) up to \\(C_{999}\\). Cup \\(C_0\\) contains no\nsugar, cup \\(C_1\\) one grain of sugar, cup \\(C_2\\) two grains\netc. Since one cannot taste the difference between \\(C_{999}\\) and\n\\(C_{998}\\), one might consider them to be equally good (of equal\nvalue), \\(C_{999}\\sim C_{998}\\). For the same reason, we have\n\\(C_{998}\\sim C_{997}\\), etc. all the way to \\(C_1\\sim C_0\\), but\nclearly \\(C_0 \\succ C_{999}\\). This contradicts transitivity of\nindifference, and therefore also transitivity of weak preference.\n\nIn a related example proposed by Warren S. Quinn, a device has been\nimplanted into the body of a person (the self-torturer). The device\nhas 1001 settings, from 0 (off) to 1000. Each increase leads to a\nnegligible increase in pain. Each week, the self-torturer \u201chas\nonly two options\u2014to stay put or to advance the dial one setting.\nBut he may advance only one step each week, and he may never\nretreat. At each advance he gets $10,000.\u201d In this way\nhe may \u201ceventually reach settings that will be so painful that\nhe would then gladly relinquish his fortune and return to 0\u201d\n(Quinn 1990, 79).\n\nIn an important type of counterexamples to transitivity of strict\npreference, different properties of the alternatives dominate in\ndifferent pairwise comparisons. Consider an agent choosing between\nthree boxes of Christmas ornaments (Schumm 1987). Each box contains\nthree balls, coloured green, red and blue, respectively; they are\nrepresented by the vectors \\(\\langle R_1,G_1,B_1\\rangle,\\) \\(\\langle\nR_2,G_2,B_2\\rangle\\), and \\(\\langle R_3,G_3,B_3\\rangle\\).  The agent\nstrictly prefers box 1 to box 2, since they contain (to her) equally\nattractive blue and green balls, but the red ball of box 1 is more\nattractive than that of box 2. She prefers box 2 to box 3, since they\nare equal but for the green ball of box 2, which is more attractive\nthan that of box 3. And finally, she prefers box 3 to box 1, since\nthey are equal but for the blue ball of box 3, which is more\nattractive than that of box 1. Thus,\n\n\\[R_1\\succ R_2\\sim R_3\\sim R_1,\\]\n\n\\[G_1\\sim G_2\\succ G_3\\sim G_1,\\]\n\n\\[B_1\\sim B_2\\sim B_3\\succ B_1;\\]\n\n\nand from this follows\n\n\\[\n\\langle R_1,G_1,B_1\\rangle \\succ \\langle R_2,G_2,B_2\\rangle \\succ \\langle R_3,G_3,B_3\\rangle \\succ \\langle R_1,G_1,B_1\\rangle.\n\\]\n\n\nThe described situation yields a preference cycle, which contradicts\ntransitivity of strict preference. (Notice the structural similarity\nto Condorcet\u2019s Paradox, see the entry on\n voting methods.)\n\nThese and similar examples can be used to show that actual human\nbeings may have cyclic preferences. It does not necessarily follow,\nhowever, that the same applies to the idealized rational\nagents of preference logic. Perhaps such patterns are due to\nirrationality or to factors, such as lack of knowledge or\ndiscrimination, that prevent actual humans from being rational. There\nis a strong tradition, not least in economic applications, to regard\nfull \\(\\succcurlyeq\\)-transitivity as a necessary prerequisite of\nrationality.\n\nThe most famous argument in favour of preference transitivity is the\nmoney pump argument. The basic idea was developed by F.P. Ramsey\n(1928a, 182), who pointed out that if a subject\u2019s behaviour\nviolated certain axioms of probability and preference, then \nhe would be willing to buy a bet that yields a gain to the seller, and a loss to the buyer, no matter what happens. The argument was developed in more detail\nin Davidson et al. (1955). \n\nThe following example can be used to show how the argument works in a\nnon-probabilistic context: A certain stamp-collector has cyclic\npreferences with respect to three stamps, denoted \\(A, B\\), and\n\\(C\\). She prefers \\(A\\) to \\(B, B\\) to \\(C\\), and \\(C\\) to \\(A\\).\nFollowing Ramsey, we may assume that there is an amount of money, say\n10 cents, that she is prepared to pay for exchanging \\(B\\) for \\(A,\nC\\) for \\(B\\), or \\(A\\) for \\(C\\).  She comes into a stamp shop with\nstamp \\(A\\). The stamp-dealer offers her to trade in \\(A\\) for \\(C\\),\nif she pays 10 cents. She accepts the deal.\n\nFor a precise notation, let \\(\\langle X,V\\rangle\\) denote\nthat the collector owns stamp \\(X\\) and has paid \\(V\\) cents\nto the dealer. She has now moved from the state\n\\(\\langle A,0\\rangle\\) to the state \\(\\langle C,10\\rangle\\).\n\nNext, the stamp-dealer takes out stamp \\(B\\) from a drawer, and\noffers her to swap \\(C\\) for \\(B\\), against another payment\nof 10 cents. She accepts, thus moving from the state\n\\(\\langle C,10\\rangle\\) to \\(\\langle B,20\\rangle\\). The shop-owner\ncan go on like this forever. What causes the trouble is the following\nsequence of preferences:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\langle C,10\\rangle &\\succ \\langle A,0\\rangle  \\\\\n\\langle B,20\\rangle &\\succ \\langle C,10\\rangle \\\\\n\\langle A,30\\rangle &\\succ \\langle B,20\\rangle \\\\\n\\langle C,40\\rangle &\\succ \\langle A,30\\rangle \\\\\n\\langle B,50\\rangle &\\succ \\langle C,40\\rangle \\\\\n\\langle A,60\\rangle &\\succ \\langle B,50\\rangle \\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe money-pump argument relies on a particular, far from\nuncontroversial, way to combine preferences in two dimensions, which\nis only possible if two crucial assumptions are satisfied: (1) The\nprimary alternatives (the stamps) can be combined with some other\ncommodity (money) to form composite alternatives. (2) Irrespectively\nof the previous transactions there is always, for each preferred\nchange of primary alternatives, some non-zero loss of the auxiliary\ncommodity (money) that is worth that change. The money-pump can be\nused to extract money from a subject with cyclic preferences only if\nthese two conditions are satisfied.\n\nAnother argument for the normative appropriateness of preference\ntransitivity suggests that transitivity is constitutive of the meaning\nof preference, in addition to the minimal properties mentioned in\nsection 2.1. Drawing an analogy to length measurement, Davidson (1976,\n273) asks: \u201cIf length is not transitive, what does it mean to\nuse a number to measure length at all? We could find or invent an\nanswer, but unless or until we do, we must strive to interpret\n\u2018longer than\u2019 so that it comes out transitive. Similarly\nfor \u2018preferred to\u2019\u201d. Violating transitivity,\nDavidson claims, thus undermines the very meaning of preferring an\noption over others. \n\nYet another argument rests on the importance of preferences for\nchoice. When agents choose from an \nalternative set, then preferences should be choice guiding.\nThey should have such a structure that they can be used to guide our\nchoice among the elements of that set. But when choosing e.g. from\n\\(\\{A,B,C\\}\\), a preference relation \\(\\succ\\) such that\n\\(A\\succ B\\succ C\\succ A\\) does not\nguide choice at all: any or none of the alternatives should be chosen\naccording to \\(\\succ\\). The transitivity of preference, it is therefore\nsuggested, is a necessary condition for a meaningful connection\nbetween preferences and choice. A critic, however, can point out that\npreferences are important even when they cannot guide choices. Take\ne.g. preferences over lottery outcomes: these are real preferences,\nregardless of the fact that one cannot choose between lottery\noutcomes. Further, the necessary criteria for choice guidance are much\nweaker than weak transitivity (Hansson 2001, 23\u201325; compare also\nversions of decision theory in which transitivity fails, e.g. Fishburn\n1991). Last, the indifference relation does not satisfy choice\nguidance either. That does not make it irrational to be indifferent\nbetween alternatives. Thus, choice guidance can be an argument for the\nnormative appropriateness of transitivity only under certain\nrestrictions, if at all (For further discussion, see Anand 1993). \n",
