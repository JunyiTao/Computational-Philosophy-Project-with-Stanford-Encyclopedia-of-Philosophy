Why the MWI?\n\nFor proponents of the MWI, the main reason for adopting it is that it\navoids the collapse of the quantum wave. (Other no-collapse theories\nare not better than MWI for various reasons, e.g., the nonlocality of\nBohmian mechanics, see Brown and Wallace 2005; and the disadvantage of\nall of them is that they have some additional structure, see Vaidman\n2014). The collapse postulate is a physical law that differs from all\nknown physics in two aspects: it is genuinely random and it involves\nsome kind of action at a distance. Note that action at a distance due\nto collapse is a controversial issue, see the discussion in Vaidman 2016b\nand Myrvold 2016. According to the collapse postulate the outcome of a\nquantum experiment is not determined by the initial conditions of the\nUniverse prior to the experiment: only the probabilities are governed\nby the initial state. There is no experimental evidence in favor of\ncollapse and against the MWI. We need not assume that Nature plays\ndice: science has stronger explanatory power. The MWI is a\ndeterministic theory for a physical Universe and it explains why a\nworld appears to be indeterministic for human observers.\n\nThe MWI does not have action at a distance. The most celebrated\nexample of nonlocality of quantum mechanics given by\n Bell\u2019s theorem\n in the context of the\n Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument\n cannot get off the ground in the framework of the MWI because it\nrequires a single outcome of a quantum experiment, see the discussion in\nBacciagaluppi 2002, Brown and Timpson 2016. Although the MWI removes\nthe most bothersome aspect of nonlocality, action at a distance, the\nother aspect of quantum nonlocality, the nonseparability of remote\nobjects manifested in entanglement, is still there. A\n\u201cworld\u201d is a nonlocal concept. This explains why we\nobserve nonlocal correlations in a particular world.\n\nDeutsch 2012 claims to provide an alternative vindication of quantum\nlocality using a quantum information framework. This approach started\nwith Deutsch and Hayden 2000 analyzing the flow of quantum information\nusing the Heisenberg picture. After discussions by Rubin 2001 and\nDeutsch 2002, Hewitt-Horsman and Vedral 2007 analyzed the uniqueness\nof the physical picture of the information flow. Timpson 2005 and\nWallace and Timpson 2007 questioned the locality demonstration in this\napproach and the meaning of the locality claim was clarified in\nDeutsch 2012. Rubin 2011 suggested that this approach might provide a\nsimpler route toward generalization of the MWI of quantum mechanics to\nthe MWI of field theory. Recent works Raymond-Robichaud 2020, Kuypers\nand Deutsch 2021, B\u00e9dard 2021a, clarified the meaning of the\nDeutsch and Hayden proposal as an alternative local MWI which not only\nlacks action at a distance, but provides a set of local descriptions\nwhich completely describes the whole physical Universe. However, there\nis a complexity price. B\u00e9dard 2021b argues that  \u201cthe\ndescriptor of a single qubit has larger dimensionality than the\nSchr\u00f6dinger state of the whole network or of the\nUniverse!\u201d\n\nThe MWI resolves most, if not all, paradoxes of quantum mechanics\n(e.g., Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat), see Vaidman 1994, McQueen and Vaidman\n2020. A physical paradox is a phenomenon contradicting our intuition.\nThe laws of physics govern the Universe incorporating all the worlds\nand this is why, when we limit ourselves to a single world, we may run\ninto a paradox. An example is getting information about a region from\nwhere no particle ever came using the interaction-free\nmeasurement of Elitzur and Vaidman 1993. Indeed, on the scale of\nthe Universe there is no paradox: in other worlds particles were in\nthat region.\n\nVaidman 2001 finds it advantageous to think about all worlds together\neven in analysing a controversial issue of classical probability\ntheory, the\n Sleeping Beauty problem.\n Accepting the Probability Postulate reduces the analysis of\nprobability to a calculation of the measures of existence of various\nworlds. Note, however, that the Quantum Sleeping Beauty problem also\nbecame a topic of a hot controversy: Lewis 2007, Papineau and\nDur\u00e0-Vil\u00e0 2009, Groisman et al. 2013, Bradley\n2011, Wilson 2014, Schwarz 2015.\n\nStrong proponents of the MWI can be found among cosmologists, e.g.,\nTipler 1986b, Aguirre and Tegmark 2011. In quantum cosmology the MWI\nallows for discussion of the whole Universe, thereby avoiding the\ndifficulty of the standard interpretation which requires an external\nobserver, see Susskind 2016 for more analysis of the connections\nbetween the MWI and cosmology. Bousso and Susskind 2012 argued that\neven considerations in the framework of string theory lead to the\nMWI.\n\nAnother community where many favor the MWI is that of the researchers\nin quantum information. In quantum computing, the key issue is the\nparallel processing performed on the same computer; this is very\nsimilar to the basic picture of the MWI. Recently the usefulness of\nthe MWI for explaining the speedup of quantum computation has been\nquestioned: Steane 2003, Duwell 2007, Cuffaro 2012, forthcoming. It is not\nthat the quantum computation cannot be understood without the\nframework of the MWI; rather, it is just easier to think about quantum\nalgorithms as parallel computations performed in parallel worlds,\nDeutsch and Jozsa 1992. There is no way to use all the information\nobtained in all parallel computations \u2014 the quantum computer\nalgorithm is a method in which the outcomes of all calculations\ninterfere, yielding the desired result. The cluster-state quantum\ncomputer also performs parallel computations, although it is harder to\nsee how we get the final result. The criticism follows from\nidentifying the computational worlds with decoherent worlds. A quantum\ncomputing process has no decoherence and the preferred basis is chosen\nto be the computational basis.\n\nRecent studies suggest that some of the fathers of quantum mechanics\nheld views close to the MWI: Allori et al. 2011 say this\nabout Schr\u00f6dinger, and Becker 2004 about von Neumann. At the\nbirth of the MWI Wheeler 1957 wrote: \u201cNo escape seems possible\nfrom this relative state formulation if one wants to have a complete\nmathematical model for the quantum mechanics \u2026\u201d Since then,\nthe MWI struggled against the\n Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics,\n see Byrne 2010, Barrett and Byrne 2012, gaining legitimacy in recent\nyears Deutsch 1996, Bevers 2011, Barrett 2011, Tegmark 2014, Susskind\n2016, Zurek 2018 and Brown 2020 in spite of the very diverse opinions\nin the talks of its 50th anniversary celebration: Oxford 2007,\nPerimeter 2007, Saunders et al. 2010.\n\nBerenstain 2020 argues that the MWI is the latest example of\nsuccessive scientific revolutions which forced humans to abandon the\nprejudice that they occupy a privileged position at the center of the\nUniverse. The heliocentric model of the Solar System, Darwinian\nevolution and the Special Theory of Relativity follow this pattern. The\nMWI offers metaphysical neutrality between the perspectives of\nobservers on different branches of the Universal wave function, as\nopposed to single-world theories which give a privileged perspective\non reality to one observer.\n",
