    "main_text": "Sin as State || Constitutional Fault and Original Guilt\n4.3 Constitutional Fault and Original Guilt\n\nCouenhoven describes the third component of the doctrine of original\nsin as its conceptual center, with the other parts of the doctrine\nproviding \u201ca background that assists us in understanding the\ncenter of the doctrine\u201d (Couenhoven 2013: 47). This third\ncomponent is itself the conjunction of two claims: the first being\nabout constitutional fault, which Couenhoven also sometimes calls\n\u201coriginal sin itself\u201d (Couenhoven 2013: 23), and the\nsecond being that one is morally blameworthy or suffers from original\nguilt in virtue of that constitutional fault. While Couenhoven may be\ncorrect that much of the historical reflection on original sin\ninvolves both of these elements, the second of these claims is\ncontroversial in contemporary philosophical work on original sin.\n\nCouenhoven describes constitutional fault as a kind of moral\n\u201cimproper functioning qua human being\u201d\n(Couenhoven 2013: 12) that involves \u201can inherited state of\ndisordered desire and ignorance\u201d (Couenhoven 2013: 30). This\nelement has also been described as a disordering of human desires such\nthat they \u201care now congenitally turned away from God\u201d and\nin bondage to sin (McFarland 2016: 308). There are two main ways of\nunderstanding the distortion or corruption involved in constitutional\nfault. The first is as a loss of original righteousness or \u201ca\ndeprivation of original holiness and justice\u201d (Catechism of\nthe Catholic Church 2003, part I, section 2, paragraph 7, 405).\nThe second is as an actual perversion of the moral nature of humanity\n(see McCall 2019: 159).\n\nOriginal guilt, on the other hand, is defended by very few\nphilosophers, although William Wainwright suggests that original guilt\nis essential to the doctrine of original sin (Wainright 1988: 31).\nThomas McCall refers to those views that reject original guilt as\n\u201ccorruption-only doctrines\u201d (McCall 2019: 156). The denial\nof original guilt is found in the Catholic tradition (see\nCatechism of the Catholic Church 2003, part I, section 2,\nparagraph 7, 405) and many of the Orthodox traditions (see Louth\n2020). Among contemporary philosophers, corruption-only views are\nendorsed by Crisp 2020a, McFarland 2016, McFadyen 2016, Hudson 2014,\nWyma 2004, Plantinga 2000, Quinn 1997, Morris 1992, and Swinburne\n1989.\n\nAccording to Michael C. Rea (2007), much of the opposition to the idea\nof original guilt comes from its prima facie conflict with\nthe following \u201cprinciple of possible prevention\u201d:\n\n(MR)\nA person P is morally responsible for the obtaining of a\nstate of affairs S only if S obtains (or obtained) and\nP could have prevented S from obtaining.\n\n\nRea argues that no part of the doctrine of original sin, including\noriginal guilt, contradicts (MR). Rather, one gets a contradiction\nwhen the doctrine of original sin is conjoined with the following\nplausible assumption:\n\n(A1)\nNo human being born after Adam\u2019s first sin could have done\nanything to prevent Adam\u2019s first sin; and no human who is born\ncorrupt could have done anything to prevent her own corruption.\n\n\nRea then develops two different theories of original guilt that are\ninconsistent with (A1), one drawing on realism and perdurantism\n(roughly, the view that ordinary objects like humans persist through\ntime in virtue of having temporal parts) and the other drawing on\nMolinist assumptions.
