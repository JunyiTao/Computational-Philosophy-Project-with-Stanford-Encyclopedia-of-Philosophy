    "main_text": "Capitalism\n4. Capitalism\n\nWe can understand capitalism as an economic system where the range of\ngoods and services on offer is governed in accord with a strong right\nto private property and a system in which prices are set by private\norganizations. People are free to exchange goods and services under\nwhatever terms they contract for, with few restrictions. Neoliberals\nshare this understanding, even if they do not always defend capitalism\nby name.\n\nIn defending capitalism, neoliberals focus on defeating two foes:\nsocialism and Keynesianism, which they typically consider as offering\nthe most influential alternatives to their preferred institutions.\nSocialism, at least the form of socialism targeted by neoliberals, is\nan economic system where capital is socially owned, typically by\ngovernment, and the capital stock is produced, organized, and its\noutputs distributed by the central government that is, where the\neconomy is centrally planned. Neoliberals attack Marxist socialism in\nthe strongest terms, but Marxists are not their sole targets. Hayek is\nkeen to refute the twentieth century socialist Oskar Lange (1936), who\nadopted some aspects of neoclassical economics. Neoliberals also\ntargeted democratic socialism; for example, Hayek (1944 [2007:\n163\u20134]) targeted Fabian socialists in The Road to\nSerfdom.\n\nThe neoliberal case against socialism is based on three concerns:\ninefficiency, conflict, and power. Socialism is inefficient, generates\nsocial conflict, and concentrates power in dangerous ways. Let\u2019s\nbegin with inefficiency, the familiar argument that socialist\neconomies impoverish society vis-\u00e0-vis\n capitalism.[5]\n Hayek\u2019s early claim to fame was his role in what is called the\nsocialist calculation debate, which concerned how socialist planners\ncan plan the production and distribution of capital goods without the\nuse of a price system. Socialists argued that planners should be able\nto plan by collecting preference and production information from\ncitizens. Ludwig von Mises (1922 [1936/1951]) began the debate by\narguing that, without a price system, the information required to plan\nthe economy did not exist. Without a price system, there is no\ninformation for planners to collect and compute. Oskar Lange (1936)\nreplied that socialist managers of firms could mimic market prices.\nHayek (1945) disagreed with Lange; even if the information required to\nplan the economy existed, it would be too hard to collect and\nimpossible to compute before the relevant information changed. The\nproblem is that the information required to plan the economy is not\ngiven to anyone. For Hayek, we can plan the economy\n\n\nif we possess all the relevant information, if we\ncan start out from a given system of preferences, and if we\ncommand complete knowledge of available means.\n\n\nBut that is \u201cemphatically not the economic problem\nwhich society faces\u201d (1945: 519). Instead,\n\n\nthe \u201cdata\u201d from which the economic calculus starts are\nnever for the whole society \u201cgiven\u201d to a single mind which\ncould work out the implications and can never be so given.\n\n\nIn contrast, the market economy can make use of this information\nthrough the price system. The price system can draw on each\nperson\u2019s local and often tacit knowledge to effectively produce\ngoods and services without collecting that information in one place.\nThe \u201cmarvel\u201d of the market is that, when some raw material\nis scarce,\n\n\ntens of thousands of people whose identity could not be ascertained by\nmonths of investigations, are made to use the material or its products\nmore sparingly,\n\n\nand this occurs\n\n\nwithout an order being issued, without more than perhaps a handful of\npeople knowing the cause. (1945: 527)\n\n\nHayek\u2019s analysis of how minds process information (Caldwell\n2004: 261\u2013285) and how commercial society, and systems of\ncultural and moral rules, evolve is perhaps the principal focus of his\nwork (2004: 286\u2013321). Friedman (2000 [2012: 234]) and Buchanan\n(1969: 87\u20138) agree with Hayek\u2019s\n analysis.[6]\n\nNeoliberals appeal to a range of considerations to justify the market\nbesides informational arguments, such as the creativity of the market\nmechanism and its capacity to raise living standards. Eamonn Butler\n(1985: 22) points out that Friedman\u2019s case for capitalism, as\ndeveloped in Capitalism and Freedom, is based on\n\n\nthe diversity, rapid adjustment, innovation and experimentation found\nin the market.\n\n\nIn Free to Choose, Friedman argues that, when the state\nattempts to centrally plan, ordinary citizens \u201chave a low\nstandard of living\u201d (Friedman & Friedman: 54\u20135). The\nmarket, on the other hand, has \u201cthe remarkable power of raising\nmaterial standards quicker than any other\u201d system, while\npreserving freedom (Butler 1985: 197). Hayek (1978: 67) emphasizes\nthat capitalism preserves competition, which he sees not as a means of\nreaching a market-clearing price but as a \u201cdiscovery\nprocedure\u201d for generating new ideas and innovations. Buchanan\ntends to focus on the argument that markets provide people with better\nincentives than those faced by government officials. Because\n\n\npoliticians and bureaucrats are seen as ordinary persons much like the\nrest of us, (Buchanan 1979: B4 [1984: 20])\n\n\nthey lack the motivation to even try to implement a socialist\nplan. Instead, they will use their power over the economy at least\npartly for selfish ends, which would undermine the effectiveness of\nsocialist government, even if all the informational problems could be\nsolved.\n\nThe next set of arguments against socialism is that socialism creates\nneedless conflict. Hayek writes that socialism\n\n\npresupposes a much more complete agreement in the relative importance\nof different social ends than actually exists\n\n\nand that, as a result,\n\n\nthe planning authority must impose upon the people the detailed code\nof values that is lacking. (1997: 193; also see 1944 [2007: 109,\n166])\n\n\nFriedman argues similarly in saying that\n\n\nthe wider the range of activities covered by the market, the fewer are\nthe issues on which explicitly political decisions are required and\nhence on which it is necessary to achieve agreement. (1962a [2002:\n24])\n\n\nMarkets allow people who disagree to benefit one another despite\nhaving different values. Socialism, in contrast, requires a central\nplan, and so must impose controversial and sectarian values and ends\non everyone. To solve these conflicts and impose a central plan,\nsocialist governments must concentrate political power.\n\nSocialism excessively concentrates power in other ways, too.\nSocialists have often argued that capitalist economic power can be\nreined in by transferring the means of production to society, but\nHayek (1944 [2007: 165]) replies that socialism does not\n\u201cextinguish power\u201d, it just concentrates power in one\nplace. Friedman (1955 [2017: 4]) agrees, arguing that \u201cpolitical\npower by its nature tends to be concentrated\u201d whereas economic\npower \u201ccan be highly deconcentrated if it is organized by means\nof an impersonal market\u201d. The danger of concentrating power in\npolitical institutions is that \u201cgovernment is more subject to\nconcentrated interest groups\u201d, whereas markets are altered by\nthe \u201cdiffuse pressure of millions of individual\nconsumers\u201d. Similarly, while governments promote monopolies,\n\u201cthe market breaks them down\u201d (Butler 1985: 223). An\nadvantage of markets is that people can refuse to engage in exchange,\nwhereas under socialism everyone is caught up in a power struggle.\nAdditionally, Hayek (1978: 99) argues that under socialism, political\npower determines the social position of individuals and groups, an\nironic result of a doctrine whose aim is to diffuse power. Buchanan\n(1993: 246) agrees, though for somewhat different reasons.\n\nNeoliberals do not defend capitalism on the ground that it gives\npeople what they deserve. Friedman and Buchanan do not make such\narguments, and Hayek argues against such claims. Hayek (1978:\n70) repeatedly says that there\u2019s no particular merit in market\noutcomes, and so one cannot say that market income is just or unjust.\nHayek, Friedman, and Buchanan understand that market outcomes are\noften arbitrary from a moral point of view. Markets make some\nundeserving persons rich and some deserving persons poor.\n\nAs noted, Keynesianism is neoliberalism\u2019s other great foe. Let\nus understand Keynesianism as a series of policy proposals aimed at\ncorrecting purported market failures at the macroeconomic level, and\nespecially as the use of deficit-financed spending to manage the\nbusiness cycle and stimulate the economy. These policies were inspired\nby John Maynard Keynes (1935 [1965: 2011]), even if he did not always\nconsistently adopt\n them.[7]\n\nAll three thinkers take great pains to answer Keynesian arguments for\ngovernment intervention. Hayek\u2019s (1941 [2007]) arguments concern\nhow government spending and the monetary authority\u2019s actions\naffect the structure of capital goods across the economy. Contra\nKeynes\u2019s (1935 [1965: 37\u201345]) comfort with statistical\naggregates in the General Theory, Hayek (1941 [2007])\ncontends that relying on simple economic aggregates obscures how\ncapital and investment are structured across the economy. Hayek also\nthinks the premier cause of recessions is policy that makes bank\ncredit too easy, which leads to malinvestment that has to be\nliquidated in a bust. Importantly Hayek\u2019s critique of Keynes was\nnot influential in the latter half of the twentieth century.\nFriedman\u2019s and Buchanan\u2019s ideas, especially\nFriedman\u2019s, carried more weight.\n\nFriedman and Buchanan are concerned about Keynesian claims that\nrecessions are due to declines in aggregate demand and can only be\naddressed with heavy helpings of debt-financed fiscal stimulus (even\nthough Keynes himself was not always a fan of debt-financed\ncountercyclical policy). Friedman (1959) developed the doctrine of\nmonetarism, which holds that inflation is always and everywhere a\nmonetary phenomenon. Inflation and the business cycle can be\ncontrolled by monetary policy and so do not require a fiscal response.\nWith his co-author, Anna Schwartz, Friedman (Friedman & Schwartz\n1963) argues that the Great Depression was due not to a fall in\naggregate demand but was instead caused by the Federal Reserve System,\nironically created to manage recessions, because the Fed allowed the\nmonetary base to collapse. Had the Fed ensured the growth of the\nmonetary supply, the Great Depression could have been avoided. This is\ncentral to the case for the market because the Great Depression was\nwidely blamed on capitalism. If the Depression was a\ngovernment failure, the result of monetary mismanagement,\nthen the Depression provides no basis for rejecting\ncapitalism\u2014and may even provide reason to embrace it.\n\nThe central policy response, for Friedman (1959), is to shift the\nmanagement of the business cycle from Congress to the Federal Reserve\nand lock the Federal Reserve into a monetary expansion rule to prevent\nit from making major mistakes. Monetary-policy makers are simply not\nknowledgeable enough to use monetary policy to manage the business\ncycle. Instead, they should be bound to a rule that would lead to\ngentle inflation, which would both avoid hyperinflation and prevent\ncyclical unemployment by mitigating the dislocations caused by sticky\nnominal wages, contra Keynes (1935 [1965: 231\u20137]). Focusing\nexclusively on growing the monetary base would also prevent a collapse\nin the money supply and thereby avoid some kinds of recession.\n\nBuchanan\u2019s critique of Keynes differs from Friedman\u2019s,\nthough their critiques are mutually reinforcing. Buchanan (1987, 1999)\nthinks that even if Keynes\u2019s diagnosis of recessions is correct,\nhis cure cannot work well so long as governments are staffed with\nreal-world people. Many politicians and government officials are more\nconcerned about benefiting themselves and special interest groups than\nabout promoting the common good. So, when a government engages in\ndebt-financed economic stimulus, the money is more likely to be\ndirected to politicians\u2019 favored groups than to the places the\nstimulus money is most needed. A central difficulty for Keynesian\nfiscal policy is the pervasive risk of government failure caused by\nthe actions of often self-interested economic actors, a consistent\ntheme of The Calculus of Consent (Buchanan & Tullock\n1962). Likewise, once people develop a taste for direct transfers,\nthey will make it hard to shrink the deficit when the recession is\nover, leading to long-term debt and lower economic prosperity and\ngrowth.\n",
