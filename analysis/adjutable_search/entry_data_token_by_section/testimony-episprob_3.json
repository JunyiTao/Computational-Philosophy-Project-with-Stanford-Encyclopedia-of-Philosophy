The primary\nmotivation for these hybrid views is to capture what seems promising\nabout the Reductionist and Non-Reductionist approaches while also\navoiding the objections discussed above.\n\nFor instance, instead of endorsing Reductionism and requiring that\nall hearers must possess strong, non-testimonially based\npositive reasons for thinking that the speaker in question is\nreliable, one might opt for a qualified hybrid view according to which\n(a) adults need to possess these positive reasons but (b) youngsters\nin the developmental phase do not, i.e., children are justified in\nbelieving a speaker\u2019s testimony so long as they do not have any\nreasons to not do so. One upshot of this hybrid view is that unlike\nstandard versions of Reductionism, it is possible for young children\nto be justified in believing what their parents tell them. See, e.g.,\nE. Fricker (1995).\n\nOr, one might opt for a hybrid view according to which the hearer and\nthe speaker both have an important role to play in the hearer\u2019s\nability to acquire testimonial justification, i.e., it takes two\nto tango, so to speak. For instance, perhaps a hearer does need\nto possess at least some non-testimonially based reasons for thinking\nthat the speaker in question is a reliable testifier on this occasion.\nBut insofar as the hearer\u2019s inference from \u201cS said\nthat p\u201d to \u201cP\u201d is not the only thing\nthat justifies the hearer\u2019s belief, these reasons do not need to\nbe nearly as strong as standard Reductionists have made them out to\nbe; that is, so long as the hearer\u2019s non-testimonially based\nreasons render it not irrational to rely on the speaker\u2019s\nsay-so, then this is good enough. And this is because, in addition to\nthe hearer having these weaker kinds of positive reasons, the speaker\nin question needs to actually be a reliable reporter. The hope here is\nthat by requiring contributions from both the speaker and the hearer,\nall of the worries associated with standard versions of Reductionism\nand Non-reductionism can be avoided. For instance, by requiring that\nthe speaker has these weaker kinds of positive reasons, this hybrid\nview can explain how young children can acquire testimonial\njustification while also avoiding the worries associated with\ngullibility. See, e.g., Lackey (2008). And for defenses of other\nhybrid views, see E. Fricker (2006b), Faulkner (2000), Lehrer (2006),\nand Pritchard (2006).\n\nWhether any of these hybrid views will ultimately succeed is still\nvery much an open debate. However, opponents have worried that at\nleast some of these accounts either run into the same objections that\nplagued standard versions of Reductionism and Non-Reductionism, or\nthat they incur entirely new problems of their own, e.g., Insole\n(2000), Weiner (2003) and Lackey (2008).\n",
