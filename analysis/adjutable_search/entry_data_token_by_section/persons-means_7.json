    "main_text": "Treating Another Merely as a Means and Acting Wrongly\n5. Using Another, but Not Merely as a Means\n\nWe have explored sufficient conditions for treating another merely as\na means. But just as challenging as pinpointing them is specifying\nwhen someone uses another, but not merely as a means.\nAccording to one proposal, if an agent uses another, she does\nnot use him merely as a means if he gives his voluntary,\ninformed consent to her use of him. To fix ideas let us say that the\nconsent of the person being used is voluntary only if he is not being\ncoerced into giving it and informed only if he understands how he is\nbeing used and to what purpose(s). This proposal seems intuitively\nattractive. If a person agrees to someone using him and understands\nher ends in doing so, then how can she be treating him merely as a\nmeans?\n\nAppealing to reflective common sense, philosophers have tried to\nillustrate how. We might refer to one range of cases they invoke as\nexploitation cases because they seem to involve one person\ntaking unfair advantage of another, which is a hallmark of\nexploitation (Wertheimer 1996). To cite one such case, suppose that a\nmother of modest means cannot afford to give her children a good\neducation. A rich person proposes to finance her children\u2019s\nenrollment at excellent schools in exchange for her serving as his\npersonal slave (Davis 1984: 392). The mother might understand the use\nhe intends to put her to and for what purposes. Moreover, if we think\nof coercion as involving an agent threatening to make someone worse\noff than she would be if she did not interact with the agent, then the\nrich person would not count as coercing the mother into agreeing to\nhis use of her. The account of using another but not merely as a means\nthat we are considering might, therefore, imply that the rich person\nis not just using the mother in making her his personal slave. That\nimplication strikes some as implausible.\n\nAnother type of case that might cause problems for this account\ninvokes unnecessary or otiose threats designed to force another to\nserve one\u2019s purposes. Here is an example of such a case. An\nelderly salesperson thinks that his company is trying to force him\ninto retirement by keeping its latest sales leads from him. Desperate\nto make a sale, he intends to use his office manager to obtain the\nlatest leads. The manager has the password to a database housing the\nleads. He tells her that he really needs to close some deals, and\nunless she gets the latest leads for him, he is going to reveal to\neveryone in the office that she is lesbian. He believes reasonably,\ngiven his incomplete understanding of her and of the attitudes of his\nother co-workers, that this revelation would be damaging to her\nreputation. But the office manager takes the salesperson, whom she\nthinks of as a friendly colleague, to be making an ill-advised joke.\nVirtually everyone in the office is already aware of her sexual\npreference. And, she believes, the salesperson is cognizant that it is\ncompany policy that all salespeople are to be granted access to the\nlatest leads upon request. She gives him a puzzled look and agrees to\nget him the leads right away.\n\nThe salesperson receives from the office manager her voluntary,\ninformed consent to his use of her to get the leads. She understands\nthat he intends to use her to this end. Granted, he threatens to make\nher worse off if she does not give him the leads. But it is not the\nthreat, which she does not even register as such, that generates her\nagreement to his use of her. She agrees voluntarily. Yet, despite\nobtaining her consent for his use of her, some believe that the\nsalesperson treats the office manager merely as a means and acts (at\nleast pro tanto) wrongly. Others might argue that although\nthe salesperson has revealed a moral deficiency, he has not\ndone anything wrong. Rather, he has simply revealed a morally\nfaulty attitude toward the office manager (Scanlon 2008: 46; Walen\n2014: 428\u2013429). If we judge that the salesperson does act\nwrongly, then we presumably take this case to illustrate that treating\nanother merely as a means does not necessarily amount to harming her.\nIn other words, in treating another merely as a means, an individual\ncan wrong another without harming her.\n\nRegardless of whether we judge in this case that the salesperson acts\nwrongly, the case helps to illustrate a distinction between\nagent-focused and patient-focused accounts of treating or not treating\nanother merely as a means. According to the account we are\nconsidering, let us recall, if an agent uses another, she does\nnot use him merely as a means if he gives his voluntary,\ninformed consent to her use of him. This account focuses on the other,\nthat is, on the individual treated as a means to determine whether the\nagent is treating him merely as a means. If he (i.e., the\nother) gives his informed, voluntary consent to being used in some\nway, then the agent does not treat him merely as a means, according to\nthe account. To make this determination, an agent-focused account\nwould, of course, focus more on the agent. Such an account might hold,\nfor example, that if an agent uses another, she does not use him\nmerely as a means if it is reasonable for her (the agent) to\nbelieve that the other gives his voluntary, informed consent to\nher use of him. According to the notion of reasonable belief invoked\nhere, it is reasonable for someone to believe something roughly if the\nbelief is justifiable given the person\u2019s context (e.g., his\nupbringing, cognitive limitations, and so forth). Contrary to the\npatient-focused account, the agent-focused account is free from the\nimplication that the salesperson is not treating the office manager\nmerely as a means. It is not reasonable for the salesperson\nto believe that the office manager has given her voluntary consent to\nhis use of her. It is, rather, reasonable for him to believe that he\nhas coerced her into giving him the sales leads. A parallel\npatient-based vs. agent-based distinction applies, of course, to\naccounts of sufficient conditions for treating another merely as a\nmeans. One might, for example, hold that an agent just uses another if\nthe other cannot share the end the agent is pursuing in using him (a\npatient-focused account). Or one might hold that an agent just uses\nanother if it is reasonable for her to believe that the other cannot\nshare the end the agent is pursuing in using him (an agent-focused\naccount).\n\nWe have been considering actual consent accounts of agents using\nothers, but not treating them merely as means. We can also develop\naccounts that invoke other concepts familiar from discussion of\nsufficient conditions for treating others merely as means, including\nthe concepts of possible end-sharing and possible consent. For\nexample, we might suggest that an agent who uses another does not use\nthat other merely as a means if the other can consent to the\nagent\u2019s use of him, that is, if the other can avert the use\nsimply by dissenting from it. This suggestion, as well as others that\ninvoke additional concepts we have considered, such as that of end\nsharing, might generate questionable verdicts regarding exploitation\ncases. For example, the mother of modest means discussed above can\nconsent to the rich person\u2019s use of her. Her dissent from it\nalone would stop it from occurring. But some would insist that the\nrich person is nevertheless treating her merely as a means in making\nher his personal slave in exchange for educating his children.\n\nAnother approach to conditions under which an agent uses another, but\ndoes not treat him merely as a means takes shape against a literal\nconstrual of treating others merely as means. On this construal,\ndiscussed above, we use another merely as a means roughly if we both\nuse the other and regard him as a mere tool. According to the\napproach, we do not treat another merely as a means if our\ntreatment of the other person \u201cis governed or guided in\nsufficiently important ways by some relevant moral belief or\nconcern\u201d (Parfit 2011: 214). But when is an agent\u2019s use of\nanother governed in sufficiently important ways by some relevant moral\nbelief or concern? The agent\u2019s use of another is so governed,\naccording to one response, when the agent tries to and succeeds in\nusing the other only in ways to which the other can rationally\nconsent.\n\nBut when can the other rationally consent? To simplify matters, let us\nmake some background assumptions. Let us suppose that the people who\nmight be used understand what will be done to them and to what\npurpose, as well as the effects the use will have. Let us also assume\nthat those who might be used have the power to give (or to withhold)\nconsent in the \u201cact-affecting sense\u201d (Parfit 2011:\n183\u2013184). When we ask whether they can rationally consent to\nbeing used, we are asking whether it would be rational for them to\nconsent (or dissent) supposing that their choice would determine\nwhether or not they were used.\n\nAgainst the background of these assumptions, we can say that, on this\naccount, a person can rationally consent to being treated as a means\njust in case he has sufficient reasons to consent to it. The\naccount rests on an \u201cobjective\u201d view of reasons, according\nto which\n\n\nthere are certain facts that give us reasons both to have certain\ndesires and aims, and to do whatever might achieve these aims. These\nreasons are given by facts about the objects of these desires\nor aims, or what we might want or try to achieve. (Parfit 2011:\n45)\n\n\nFor example, the fact that a child is in pain as a result of a\nsplinter stuck in his finger gives me reason to want to and to try to\nget it\n out.[13]\n On this account, we have impartial as well as partial reasons for\nagreeing to be treated in various ways. Our impartial reasons are\n\u201cperson-neutral\u201d (2011: 138). We do not need to invoke\nourselves when we describe the facts that yield these reasons. The\nfact that some event would cause tremendous pain to a particular\nperson, for example, gives us reason (albeit perhaps not sufficient\nreason) to prevent the event or relieve the pain \u201cwhoever this\nperson may be, and whatever this person\u2019s relation to us\u201d\n(2011: 138). Our partial reasons are \u201cperson-relative\u201d:\nthey \u201care provided by facts whose description must refer to\nus\u201d (2011: 138). The fact that the little boy being hurt by the\nsplinter is my son gives me a partial reason to pull it out.\nWe each have partial reasons to be particularly attentive to our own\nwell-being and to the well-being of those in our circle, for example,\nour family and friends. According to the account,\n\n\nWhen one of our two possible acts would make things go in some way\nthat would be impartially better, but the other act would make things\ngo better either for ourselves or for those to whom we have close\nties, we often have sufficient reasons to act in either of these ways.\n(2011: 137)\n\n\nFor example, regarding a case in which a person could either save\nhimself from some injury or do something that would save some\nstranger\u2019s life in a distant land, the person presumably has\nsufficient reasons to do either one. In a similar vein, a person can\nhave sufficient reason to consent to being treated as a means by\nvirtue of some impartial reason, such as the fact that his being so\ntreated will save many lives, even if he also has sufficient reason to\ndissent from being treated as a means by virtue of some partial\nreason, such as the fact that his being so treated will result in\nsuffering for him. In sum, this account holds that if an agent uses\nanother, he does not use the other merely as a means if the other has\nsufficient reasons, as just characterized, for agreeing to be\nused.\n\nThe account seems to imply that cases thought to be paradigmatic of\ntreating others merely as means do not involve treating them in this\nway. Take a case in which a pedestrian is on a bridge above a track\nwhere a train is barreling toward five people (Parfit 2011: 218). The\nonly way to save the five would be to open, by remote control, a\ntrap-door on which the pedestrian is standing, so that he would fall\nin front of the train. The train would kill him, but the impact would\ntrigger its automatic brake. If a bystander opens the trap door, then\nshe uses the pedestrian as a means to save the five. The pedestrian\nhas sufficient reasons to refrain from consenting to being used to\nstop the train. After all, it will result in his premature death. But,\naccording to the account, he also might have sufficient reasons to\nconsent to being used to stop the train; for his being used in this\nway would save the lives of five people, contributing to an outcome\nwhich is presumably impartially best (2011: 220). Suppose the\nbystander opens the trap door and uses the person on the bridge to\nsave the five. In so doing, she might be limiting her use of another\nto ways to which the other can rationally consent. If she is, then she\nis not treating the person merely as a means, according to the\naccount.\n\nConsider another well-known example. Five patients at a hospital are\nin immediate need of different organs. One patient needs a kidney,\nanother needs a liver, and so forth. If a surgeon used a healthy\nperson undergoing routine tests as a resource for organs, killing him\nin the process, all of the five would be saved (Harman 1977:\n3\u20134). The healthy person presumably has strong partial reasons\nto dissent from being used for his organs. But he also arguably has\nenough impartial reason to consent, namely, that five people will\nthereby be saved, such that overall he has sufficient reason to\nconsent. So, assuming that the surgeon is trying to treat people only\nin ways to which they can rationally consent, she might not be\ntreating the healthy person merely as a means, even if before she\nsucceeds in putting him under, he is begging for his\n life.[14]\n If the account we are considering of using others, but not merely as\nmeans does entail that the bystander and the doctor in these two cases\nare not treating others merely as means, the account suffers from a\nsignificant flaw, according to some.\n\nIn the words of one philosopher, the idea that it is wrong to treat\nothers merely as means is \u201cboth very important and very hard to\npin down\u201d (Glover 2006: 65). Our investigation has illustrated\nchallenges in specifying what it means to treat others merely as\nmeans. It has not revealed one, univocal concept, grounded in common\nsense, of what just using another amounts to. In the end, there may be\nno such concept, but rather a set of overlapping notions, which point\nto a range of morally problematic actions or attitudes concerning the\nuse of others.\n",
