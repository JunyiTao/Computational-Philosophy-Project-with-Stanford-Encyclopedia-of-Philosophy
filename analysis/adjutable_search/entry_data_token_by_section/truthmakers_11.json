    "main_text": "What Motivates the Doctrine of Truth-makers? || To catch a cheater\n3.1 To catch a cheater\n\nWhat is the motivation for adopting a theory of truth-makers, whether\nmaximalist or optimalist? Following Sider, it has become customary to\ndescribe the \u201cwhole point\u201d of adopting a theory of\ntruth-makers thus: to \u201cCatch the cheaters\u201d who don\u2019t\nbelieve in truth-makers (Sider 2001: 40\u20131; see also Merricks\n2007: 2\u20133). But this is a bit like saying that the point of a\nbenefit system is to catch out benefit frauds. It\u2019s only if\nthere is some antecedent point in favour of truth-makers that there\ncan be anything wrong with leaving them out. Nonetheless, it is\npossible that we can come to appreciate the need for truth-makers by\nappreciating what is lacking in theories that neglect them. This is\nhow C.B. Martin and Armstrong came to recognise the necessity for\nadmitting truth-makers (Armstrong 1989b: 8\u201311, 2004: 1\u20133).\nConsider phenomenalism: the view that the physical world is a\nconstruction out of sense-impressions. One obstacle for this view is\nthe need to make sense in sense-impression terms of true claims we\nmake about the unobserved world. Martin noticed that the phenomenalist\ncould only appeal to brute, ungrounded counterfactuals about possible\nexperience to do so. But counterfactuals do not float free in a void.\nThey must be responsive to an underlying reality, the reality that\nmakes them true. For Martin this was the phenomenalists\u2019 fatal\nerror: their inability to supply credible truth-makers for truths\nabout unobserved objects. The same error afflicted Ryle\u2019s\nbehaviourism with its brute counterfactuals about non-existent\nbehaviour and Prior\u2019s presentism according to which there is\nnothing outside the present and so there is nothing for past-tensed\nand future-tensed truths to be held responsible to. We come to\nappreciate the need for truth-makers as the common need these\ndifferent theories fail to fulfil.\n\nAs Lewis points out, this demand for truth-makers represented an\noverreaction to what was undoubtedly a flaw in phenomenalism (1992:\n217). We can already understand what\u2019s wrong with phenomenalism\nwhen we appreciate that it fails to provide an account of the things\nupon which the truth of counterfactuals about sense impressions\nsupervene, i.e., when we see that it fails to satisfy (Subject\nMatter). This leaves under-motivated the claim that phenomenalism\nshould also be faulted for failing to supply truth-makers to ground\ncounterfactuals about sense-impressions. The same reasoning applies to\nbehaviourism and presentism; they also fail to satisfy (Subject\nMatter). So there\u2019s no need to adopt truth makers to catch\ncheats. All we need to do is to recognise the strictures (Subject\nMatter) places upon us.\n\nIt\u2019s a further flaw of Martin and Armstrong\u2019s reasoning\nthat even if we accede to the demand for truth-makers it doesn\u2019t\nfollow that even idealism is ruled out. According to Armstrong if we\nforsake the demand for truth-makers we thereby challenge \u201cthe\nrealistic insight that there is a world that exists independently of\nour thoughts and statements, making the latter true or false\u201d\n(1997: 128). But even an idealist could accept that there are\ntruth-makers whilst thinking of them as mind-dependent entities. So\nacceding to the demand for truth-makers doesn\u2019t tell us\nwhat\u2019s wrong with idealism (Daly 2005: 95\u20137). Bergmann,\nthe grandfather of the contemporary truth-maker movement, was explicit\nabout this: \u201cthe truth of S must be grounded\nontologically. On this first move idealists and realists agree\u201d\n(Bergmann 1961: 229). The realist-idealist distinction cuts across the\ndistinction between philosophers who admit truth-makers and those that\ndon\u2019t (Dodd 2002: 83\u20134).\n\nThe demand for truth-makers doesn\u2019t help \u201ccatch\ncheaters\u201d at all. Just acknowledge, e.g., some brute\ncounterfactual facts about sense data, or brute dispositions to behave\nin one way or another, or brute facts about what happened in the past\nor will happen in the future. What\u2019s unsatisfactory about these\nposits isn\u2019t that if they existed they\u2019d fail to make true\nstatements about unobserved objects or statements about mental states\nthat failed to manifest themselves in actual behaviour or statements\nabout the past or future. The problem is that we have difficulty in\nunderstanding how such facts or dispositions could be explanatorily\nsound (Horwich 2009: 195\u20137). Whatever we find lacking in\ntheories that posit such items, it isn\u2019t that they fail to\nprovide truth-makers, because they do. Of course if we are already\ncommitted to the need for truth makers then we will likely conceive of\nthe demand for them as, e.g., drawing the phenomenalist out into the\nopen to reveal the unfitness of their explanatory posits. But unless\nwe already have independent reasons for recognising the demand for\ntruth makers, catching cheaters cannot provide a motivation for\npositing them.\n",
