    "main_text": "Physics || Measurement\n5.3 Anti-Atomism\n\n\n\u2026 the biological-economical interpretation of the cognitive\nprocess can perfectly well co-exist on peaceable, and indeed on\nfriendly, terms with that of present-day physics. The only real\npoint of difference which has so far come to light concerns the belief\nin the reality of atoms. Here again, Planck can hardly find words\ndegrading enough for such wrong headedness \u2026. After exhorting\nthe reader, with Christian charity, to respect his opponent, P. brands\nme, in the well-known biblical words, as a \u201cfalse\nprophet.\u201d It appears that the physicists are on the way to\nfounding a church; they are already using a church\u2019s traditional\nweapons. To this I answer simply: \u201cIf belief in the\nreality of atoms is so important to you, I cut myself off from the\nphysicist\u2019s mode of thinking, I do not wish to be a true\nphysicist, I renounce all scientific respect\u2014in short: I\ndecline with thanks the communion of the faithful. I prefer\nfreedom of thought.\u201d [\u201cThe Guiding Principles of My Scientific\nTheory of Knowledge and Its Reception by My\nContemporaries.\u201d 37\u201338]\n\n\nMach\u2019s opposition to atomism has become one of his best known\nlegacies, with Mach seen as an anti-realist about unobservable\nentities. While anti-realist arguments can indeed be found in\nMach, their origins lie not in philosophical skepticism but in his\nbio-psychological view of science. Furthermore, his\nconcerns about atoms were often specific to the various competing\ntheories of the time. It should be noted that the issue of\natomism was a central scientific controversy of this period; there were\na variety of theories of atoms being put forward as well as varieties\nof alternatives. In his Principles of the Theory of\nHeat, Mach aligned himself with a phenomenological approach to\nthermodynamics\u2014a temporarily fruitful research program that avoided\nthe problems of positing theoretical causal entities.\nMach\u2019s experimental research was not in this area, but at stake\nwas not just the reality of atoms but an understanding of\nscience. Mach\u2019s attitude toward atoms was an outgrowth of a\nview of science.\n\n\nHe became embroiled in a long-standing dispute with Boltzmann,\npropounder of the kinetic theory of gasses. Boltzmann and Mach\nended up agreeing in essence: if atomic theory was fruitful it should\nbe used, but adopted what today might be considered an\nanti-metaphysical stance toward a theory that was still largely\nunsubstantiated. It is generally agreed that it was not until\n1905 with Einstein\u2019s study of Brownian motion that the kinetic\ntheory of molecules found full verification.\n\n\nMach\u2019s views on atomism are most clearly presented in an\nexchange with Planck. In 1909 Planck wrote an essay \u201cThe\nUnity of the Physical World-Picture\u201d, which contained a severe\ncriticism of Mach\u2019s philosophy. Mach replied in 1910, with\n\u201cThe Guiding Principles of My Scientific Theory of Knowledge and\nIts Reception by My Contemporaries.\u201d Planck responded in\n1910 with \u201cOn Mach\u2019s Theory of Physical Knowledge: A\nReply.\u201d\n\n\nAt issue were differences on how to make science free of human\nsubjectivity, and how to achieve a unified science. Planck [1909]\nargues that while we once defined heat according to sensations, the\nstudy of heat has gone beyond this, now being under the purview of\nelectrodynamics and kinetic theory; similarly, tones and color are now\nunderstood as frequencies or wavelengths. Although physics had\nits beginnings in the analysis of sense impressions, its current\nsuccess is due to removing these anthropomorphic elements. Planck\nformulates a vision of a human-independent science in reaction to\nMach\u2019s claim that science is human-dependent.\n\n\nPlanck thought that physics can go beyond psychological dependency\nby basing itself on psychologically independent universal\nconstants: \u201cthe constants appearing in the laws of heat\nradiation in free ether, like the constants of gravity, have a\nuniversal character and involve no reference to any special substance\nor any special body\u201d [1909]. They are human-independent in a way\nthat a unit like a centimeter is not. These constants can be used\nto \u201cestablish units of length, time, volume and temperature,\nwhich must of necessity retain their meaning for all time and for all\ncultures, even extra-terrestrial and extra-human ones\u201d\n[1909].\n\n\nMach\u2019s response is one of his last statements of position:\n\n\nI have no doubt that if, somewhere in the universe a creature\norganized like ourselves could make observations \u2026 it would\nperceive a universe working similarly to that we ourselves describe\n\u2026. As for the reality of atoms: I have no doubt that if\natomic theory corresponds to the reality given by the senses, the\nconclusions drawn from it will also bear some relation to the facts\n\u2014 though what relation remains unclear. The distance from\nthe glass of the first dark ring in reflected light corresponds to\none-half of the period of Newton\u2019s \u2018fits\u2019, but to one\nquarter of Young and Fresnel\u2019s \u2018wavelength\u2019.\nThe findings of atomic theory, likewise, can undergo a variety of\nconvenient reinterpretations, even if we are in no great hurry to take\nthem for realities.
