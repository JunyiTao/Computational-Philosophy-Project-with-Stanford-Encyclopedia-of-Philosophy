    "main_text": "Suicide, Absurdity and Happiness: The Myth of Sisyphus || The Limits of Reason\n3.2 The Limits of Reason\n\nCamus goes on to sketch other experiences of absurdity, until he\narrives at death. But although Camus seeks to avoid arguing for the\ntruth of his claims, he nevertheless concludes this \u201cabsurd\nreasoning\u201d with a series of categorical assertions addressed to\n\u201cthe intelligence\u201d about the inevitable frustration of the\nhuman desire to know the world and to be at home in it. Despite his\nintentions, Camus cannot avoid asserting what he believes to be an\nobjective truth: \u201cWe must despair of ever reconstructing the\nfamiliar, calm surface which would give us peace of heart\u201d\n(MS, 18). Turning to experiences that are seemingly obvious\nto large numbers of people who share the absurd sensibility, he\ndeclares sweepingly: \u201cThis world in itself is not reasonable,\nthat is all that can be said\u201d (MS, 21). Our efforts to\nknow are driven by a nostalgia for unity, and there is an inescapable\n\u201chiatus between what we fancy we know and what we really\nknow\u201d (MS, 18).\n\n\u201cWith the exception of professional rationalists, people today\ndespair of true knowledge\u201d (MS, 18). Camus asserts that\nthe history of human thought is characterized by \u201cits successive\nregrets and its impotences\u201d (MS, 18), and that\n\u201cthe impossibility of knowledge is established\u201d\n(MS, 25). When writing more carefully, he claims only to be\ndescribing a certain \u201cclimate,\u201d but in any case his\nbedrock assumptions appear again and again: the world is unknowable\nand life is without meaning. Our efforts to understand them lead\nnowhere.\n\nAvi Sagi suggests that in claiming this Camus is not speaking as an\nirrationalist\u2014which is, after all, how he regards the\nexistentialists\u2014but as someone trying to rationally understand\nthe limits of reason (Sagi 2002, 59\u201365). For Camus the problem\nis that by demanding meaning, order, and unity, we seek to go beyond\nthose limits and pursue the impossible. We will never understand, and\nwe will die despite all our efforts. There are two obvious responses\nto our frustrations: suicide and hope. By hope Camus means just what\nhe described in Nuptials, the religion-inspired effort to\nimagine and live for a life beyond this life. Or, second, as taken up\nat length in The Rebel, bending one\u2019s energies to\nliving for a great cause beyond oneself: \u201cHope of another life\none must \u2018deserve\u2019 or trickery of those who live not for\nlife itself but for some great idea that will transcend it, refine it,\ngive it a meaning, and betray it\u201d (MS, 8).\n\nWhat is the Camusean alternative to suicide or hope? The answer is to\nlive without escape and with integrity, in \u201crevolt\u201d and\ndefiance, maintaining the tension intrinsic to human life. Since\n\u201cthe most obvious absurdity\u201d (MS, 59) is death,\nCamus urges us to \u201cdie unreconciled and not of one\u2019s own\nfree will\u201d (MS, 55). In short, he recommends a life\nwithout consolation, but instead one characterized by lucidity and by\nacute consciousness of and rebellion against its mortality and its\nlimits.\n",
