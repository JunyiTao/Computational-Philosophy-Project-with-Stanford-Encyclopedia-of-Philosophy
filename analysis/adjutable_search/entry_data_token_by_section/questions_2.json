    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Kinds of questions\n1.2 Kinds of questions\n\nSeveral kinds of questions have been distinguished in the\nliterature.\n\nWhether-questions are questions like \u2018Was there a\nquorum at the meeting?\u2019 and \u2018Does Jones live in Italy, in\nSpain, or in Germany?\u2019. These examples illustrate that\nwhether-questions come in two varieties: a whether-question may be of\nthe yes-or-no variety, or it may present two or more alternative\ndirect answers other than yes and no. In either case, a\nwhether-question explicitly presents a finite number of direct\nanswers. Consider the first example:\n\n(3)Was there a quorum\nat the meeting?\n\n\na.\nThere was a quorum at the meeting.\n\n\nb.\nThere was no quorum at the meeting.\n\n\nThe answers to (3) are (3a\u2013b), and (3) presupposes that the\nmeeting occurred. Thus (4) is a corrective answer to (3):\n\n(4)\nThe meeting did not take place.\n\n\nQuestion (5) is ambiguous:\n\n(5)Does Jones live in\nItaly, in Spain, or in Germany?\n\n\na.\nJones lives in Italy.\n\n\nb.\nJones lives in Spain.\n\n\nc.\nJones lives in Germany.\n\n\nQuestion (5) can be read as a yes-no question having two direct\nanswers, but it also has a reading on which it presents exactly three\ndirect answers, namely (5a\u2013c). On the latter reading, (5)\npresupposes that Jones lives in Italy, in Spain, or in Germany; thus\n(6) is a corrective answer to (5):\n\n(6)Jones does not live\nin Italy, in Spain, or in Germany.\n\n\nWhich-questions are questions like \u2018What is the\nsmallest prime number greater than 12?\u2019, \u2018Which cardinal\nwas elected Pope in 2013?\u2019, and \u2018Who shot J.R.?\u2019\nUnlike a whether-question, a which-question may have an indefinite or\ninfinite number of direct answers.\n\nBelnap and Steel (1976) refer to whether- and which-questions as\nelementary questions. We consider these kinds of questions in\ndetail in section 2.\n\nAnother major category of questions are why-questions. It has\nlong been recognized that why-questions are intimately linked with the\nconcept of explanation. For example, Hempel and Oppenheim (1948, 334)\nwrite as follows:\n\nA scientific explanation may be regarded as an answer to a\nwhy-question, such as \u201cWhy do the planets move in elliptical\norbits with the sun at one focus?\u201d\n\n\nWe consider why-questions in detail in section 3.\n\nYet another major category of questions are embedded or\nindirect questions, which occur as complements of\nclause-embedding predicates such as \u2018know\u2019 and \u2018wonder\u2019:\n\n (7) John knows /\nwonders who spoke to Mary. \n\n\nThe issue of how to understand embedded questions lies at the\nintersection of the philosophy of language and epistemology and will\nbe treated in section 4.\n",
