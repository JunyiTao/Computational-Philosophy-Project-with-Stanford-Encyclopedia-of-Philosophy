    "main_text": "Historical Background\n1. Historical Background\n\nThough moral relativism did not become a prominent topic in philosophy\nor elsewhere until the twentieth century, it has ancient origins. In\nthe classical Greek world, both the historian Herodotus and the\nsophist Protagoras appeared to endorse some form of relativism (the\nlatter attracted the attention of Plato in the Theaetetus).\nIt should also be noted that the ancient Chinese Daoist philosopher\nZhuangzi put forward a nonobjectivist view that is sometimes\ninterpreted as a kind of relativism.\n\nAmong the ancient Greek philosophers, moral diversity was widely\nacknowledged, but the more common nonobjectivist reaction was moral\nskepticism, the view that there is no moral knowledge (the position of\nthe Pyrrhonian skeptic Sextus Empiricus), rather than moral\nrelativism, the view that moral truth or justification is relative to\na culture or society. This pattern continued through most of the\nhistory of Western philosophy. There were certainly occasional\ndiscussions of moral disagreement\u2014for example in Michel de\nMontaigne\u2019s Essays or in the dialogue David Hume\nattached to An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals.\nThese discussions pertained to moral objectivity, but moral relativism\nas a thesis explicitly distinguished from moral skepticism ordinarily\nwas not in focus. Prior to the twentieth century, moral philosophers\ndid not generally feel obliged to defend a position on moral\nrelativism.\n\nNonetheless, the increased awareness of moral diversity (especially\nbetween Western and non-Western cultures) on the part of Europeans in\nthe modern era is an important antecedent to the contemporary concern\nwith moral relativism. During this time, the predominant view among\nEuropeans and their colonial progeny was that their moral values were\nsuperior to the moral values of other cultures. Few thought all moral\nvalues had equal or relative validity, or anything of that sort. The\nmain impetus for such a position came from cultural anthropology.\nAnthropologists were fascinated with the diversity of cultures, and\nthey produced detailed empirical studies of them\u2014especially\n\u201cprimitive,\u201d non-Western ones. At the beginning\nanthropologists accepted the assumption of European or Western\nsuperiority. But this assumption began to be challenged in the\ntwentieth century, especially by some social scientists in the United\nStates. An early dissent came from the sociologist William Graham\nSumner, who proposed a version of moral relativism in his 1906\nFolkways. But the most influential challenge originated with\nthe anthropologist Franz Boas. He and his students\u2014in\nparticular, Ruth Benedict, Melville J. Herskovits, and Margaret\nMead\u2014explicitly articulated influential forms of moral\nrelativism in the first half of the twentieth century. In 1947, on the\noccasion of the United Nations debate about universal human rights,\nthe American Anthropological Association issued a statement declaring\nthat moral values are relative to cultures and that there is no way of\nshowing that the values of one culture are better than those of\nanother. Anthropologists have never been unanimous in asserting this,\nand more recently human rights advocacy on the part of some\nanthropologists has mitigated the relativist orientation of the\ndiscipline. Nonetheless, prominent anthropologists such as Richard A.\nShweder and the late Clifford Geertz have defended relativist\npositions in recent years.\n\nAn important early bridge from anthropology to philosophy was\nestablished by Edward Westermarck (1906\u20138 and 1932), a social\nscientist who wrote anthropological and philosophical works defending\nforms of empirical as well as metaethical moral relativism. In the\nlatter half of the 20th century, moral philosophers began devoting\nconsiderable attention to moral relativism and some\u2014most notably\nRichard B. Brandt (1954) and John Ladd (1957)\u2014took quite\nseriously the empirical effort of anthropology to understand the\nmoralities of different cultures, to the point of making such\nempirical inquiries themselves (an anticipation of the recent emphasis\non experimental philosophy, to be discussed in\n section 3).\n In the past several decades there has been increasing consideration\nof moral relativism, and there is now an enormous literature on the\nsubject (the Bibliography below is very limited). Most of these\ndiscussions are situated in the domain of \u201cpure\nmetaethics,\u201d but not all. For example, there is considerable\nwork on moral relativism in connection with human rights (Donnelly\n2013, part 2 and Okin 1998), political philosophy (Accetti 2015,\nBilgrami 2011 and Long 2004) and feminist philosophy (Code 1995\nand Khader 2019). There are also discussions of moral relativism in\napplied fields such as medical ethics (Earp 2016).\n",
