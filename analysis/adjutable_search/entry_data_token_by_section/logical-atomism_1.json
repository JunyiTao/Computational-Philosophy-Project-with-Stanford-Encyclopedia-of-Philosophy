    "main_text": "Origins and Development of Russell\u2019s Logical Atomism || The Break with Idealism and the Nature of Relations\n2.1 The Break with Idealism and the Nature of Relations\n\n In 1959, Russell himself dated his first acceptance of logical\natomism to the years 1899\u20131900, when he and G.E. Moore rejected the\nmain tenets of the dominant school of philosophy in Britain at the\ntime (to which both had previously been adherents), the tradition of\nneo-Hegelian Idealism exemplified in works of F.H. Bradley and J.M.E.\nMcTaggart, and adopted instead a fairly strong form of realism\n(MPD,  9). Of their break with idealism, Russell wrote that\n\u201cMoore led the way, but I followed closely in his footsteps\u201d\n(MPD, 42). \n\n \nIn 1899, Moore published a paper entitled \u201cThe Nature of Judgment\u201d, in\nwhich he outlined his main reasons for accepting the new realism.  It\nbegins with a discussion of a distinction made by Bradley between\ndifferent notions of idea. According to Bradley, the notion of idea\nunderstood as a mental state or mental occurrence is not the notion of\n\u201cidea\u201d relevant to logic or to truth understood as a relationship\nbetween our ideas and reality. Instead, the relevant notion of idea is\nthat of a sign or symbol representing something other than itself, or\nan idea understood as possessing meaning. Bradley understood meaning\nin terms of \u201ca part of the content \u2026 [of an idea] cut off,\nfixed by the mind, and considered apart from the existence of the\nsign\u201d (Bradley 1883, 8). Moore agreed with Bradley that it is not\nthe mental occurrence that is important to logic.  However, with\nregard to Bradley\u2019s second notion of \u201cidea\u201d, Moore accused Bradley of\nconflating the symbol with the symbolized, and rejected Bradley\u2019s view\nthat what is symbolized is itself a part of the idea and dependent\nupon it. Moore introduces the term \u201cconcept\u201d for the meaning of a\nsymbol; for Moore, what it is for different ideas to have a common\ncontent is for them to represent the same concept. However, the\nconcept itself is independent of the ideas. When we make a judgment,\ntypically, it is not our ideas, or parts of our ideas, which our\njudgment is about. According to Moore, if I make an assertion, what I\nassert is nothing about my ideas or my mental states, but a certain\n\u201cconnexion of concepts\u201d. \n\n Moore went on to introduce the term \u201cproposition\u201d for complexes of\nconcepts such as that which would be involved in a belief or judgment.\nWhile propositions represent the content of judgments, according to\nMoore, they and their constituents are entirely independent from the\njudging mind. Some propositions are true, some are not. For Moore,\nhowever, truth is not a correspondence relationship between\npropositions and reality, as there is no difference between a\nproposition\u2014understood as a mind-independent complex\u2014and that which\nwould make it true (Moore 1899, 5; Moore 1901). The facts of the\nworld then consist of true propositions, themselves understood as\ncomplexes of concepts. According to Moore, something \u201cbecomes\nintelligible first when it is analyzed into its constituent concepts\u201d\n(Moore 1899, 8). \u201cThe Nature of Judgment\u201d had a profound influence\non Russell, who later heralded it as the first account of the \u201cnew\nphilosophy\u201d to which he and Moore subscribed (MPD, 42).\n\n \nFor his own part, Russell often described his dissatisfaction with the\ndominant Idealist (and largely Monist) tradition as primarily having\nto do with the nature and existence of relations. In particular,\nRussell took issue with the claim found in Bradley and others, that\nthe notion of a fundamental relation between two distinct entities is\nincoherent. Russell diagnosed this belief as stemming from a\nwidespread logical doctrine to the effect that every proposition is\nlogically of subject-predicate form. Russell was an ardent opponent of\na position known as the \u201cdoctrine of internal relations\u201d, which\nRussell stated as the view that \u201cevery relation is grounded in the\nnatures of the related terms\u201d (MTT, 139).  Perhaps most\ncharitably interpreted (for other interpretations considered by\nRussell, see BReal, 87), this amounts to the claim that\na\u2019s bearing relation R to b is always\nreducible to properties held by a and b\nindividually, or to a property held by the complex formed of\na and b.\n\n \nIn the period leading up to his own abandonment of idealism, Russell\nwas already pursuing a research program involving the foundations of\narithmetic (see, e.g., AMR). This work, along with his\nearlier work on the foundations of geometry (see EFG), had\nconvinced him of the importance of relations for mathematics. However,\nhe found that one category of relations, viz., asymmetrical transitive\nrelations, resisted any such reduction to the properties of the relata\nor the whole formed of them. These relations are especially important\nin mathematics, as they are the sort that generates series. Consider\nthe relation of being taller than, and consider the fact that\nShaquille O\u2019Neal is taller than Michael Jordan. It might be thought\nthat this relation between O\u2019Neal and Jordan can be reduced to\nproperties of each: O\u2019Neal has the property of being 7\u20322\u2033 tall, and\nJordan has the property of being 6\u20326\u2033 tall, and the taller\nthan relation in this case is reducible to their possession of\nthese properties. The problem, according to Russell, is that for this\nreduction to hold, there must be a certain relation between the\nproperties themselves. This relation would account for the ordering of\nthe various height properties, putting the property of being-6\u20328\u2033-tall\nin between that of being-7\u20322\u2033-tall and that of being-6\u20326\u2033-tall. This\nrelation among the properties would itself be an asymmetrical and\ntransitive relation, and so the analysis has not rid us of the need\nfor taking relations as ultimate. Another hypothesis would be that\nthere is such an entity as the whole composed of O\u2019Neal and Jordan,\nand that the relation between the two men is reducible to some\nproperty of this whole.  Russell\u2019s complaint was that since the whole\ncomposed of O\u2019Neal and Jordan is the same as the whole composed of\nJordan and O\u2019Neal, this approach has no way to explain what the\ndifference would be between O\u2019Neal\u2019s being taller than Jordan and Jordan\u2019s\nbeing taller than O\u2019Neal, as both would seem to be reduced to the same\ncomposite entity bearing the same quality (see POM,\n221\u201326).\n\n \nRussell\u2019s rejection of the doctrine of internal relations is very\nimportant for understanding the development of his atomistic doctrines\nin more than one respect. Certain advocates of the claim that a\nrelation must always be grounded in the \u201cnature\u201d of its relata hold\nthat in virtue of a relating to b, a must\nhave a complex nature that includes its relatedness to\nb. Since every entity presumably bears some relation to any\nother, the \u201cnature\u201d of any entity could arguably be described as\nhaving the same complexity as the universe as a whole (if indeed, it\neven makes sense on such a picture to divide the world into distinct\nentities at all, as many denied).  Moreover, according to some within\nthis tradition, when we consider a, obviously we do not\nconsider all its relations to every entity, and hence grasp a\nin a way that falsifies the whole of what a is. This led\nsome to the claim that \u201canalysis is falsification\u201d, and even to hold\nthat when we judge that a is the father of b, and\njudge that a is the son of c, the a in the\nfirst judgment is not strictly speaking the same a as\ninvolved in the second judgment; instead, in the first we deal only\nwith a-qu\u00e2-father-of-b in the first, and\na-qu\u00e2-son-of-c in the second\n(cf. BReal, 89; MTT, 140). \n\nIn contradistinction to these views, Russell adopted what he called\n\u201cthe doctrine of external relations\u201d, which he claimed \u201cmay be\nexpressed by saying that (1) relatedness does not imply any\ncorresponding complexity in the relata; (2) any given entity\nis a constituent of many different complexes\u201d (BReal,\n87). This position on relations allowed Russell to adopt a pluralist\nphilosophy in which the world is conceived as composed of many\ndistinct, independent entities, each of which can be considered in\nisolation from its relations to other things, or its relation to the\nmind. In 1911 Russell claimed that this doctrine was the \u201cfundamental\ndoctrine\u201d of his realistic position (BReal, 87;\ncf. RA, 92; POM, 226), and it represents perhaps the\nmost important turning point in the development of his logical\natomism.\n",
