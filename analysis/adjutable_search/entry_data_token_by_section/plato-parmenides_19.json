Within D7, there are six\nArguments with the following Conclusions: If the one is not, then the\nothers are (D7A1C1), the others are other (D7A1C2), the others are\ndifferent (D7A1C3), the others are other than each other (D7A1C4), the\nothers are infinitely many (D7A2C), each of the others appears to be\none (D7A3C1), each of the others is not one (D7A3C2), the others\nappear to be infinitely many (D7A3C3), some of the others appear to be\neven, others odd (D7A3C4), none of the others is either even or odd\n(D7A3C5), among the others there appears to be a smallest (D7A4C1),\neach of the others (even the other that appears smallest) appears\nlarge in relation to its parts (D7A4C2), each of the others appears to\ncome to the equal (D7A4C3), each of the others appears to have no\nbeginning, middle, or end in relation to itself (D7A5C1), each of the\nothers appears unlimited in relation to itself (D7A5C2), each of the\nothers appears limited in relation to another (D7A5C3), each of the\nothers appears to be like itself and each of the others (D7A6C1), and\neach of the others appears to be unlike itself and each of the others\n(D7A6C2).\n\n\nMost of the individual Arguments in D7 are logically interconnected,\nand connected to Arguments within previous Deductions. The\nexceptions are D7A1C1 and D7A3C5, which do not depend on any previously\nestablished Conclusions. (For details, see Rickless (2007,\n228\u2013236).)\n\n\nIt appears that all of the Arguments in D7 are valid. Like the\nArguments of the first six Deductions, the Arguments of D7 rest on a\nnumber of independent premises, including premises of every Deduction\nother than D4 and the Appendix. Again, it appears that most of\nthe premises are, at least from Plato\u2019s point of view, either\ndefinitionally true or just plain obvious. Thus it appears that,\nfrom Plato\u2019s point of view, D7 establishes, without reliance on\nPurity-F or any other potentially problematic assumption, that if the\none is not, then the others appear to have a host of contrary\nproperties. (Thus D7 does not conform exactly to\nParmenides\u2019 earlier description of the method of the\nDeductions. What we would expect from that description is not\nthat D7 would establish that if the one is not then the others\nappear to have contrary properties, but rather that D7 would\nestablish that if the one is not then the others actually have\ncontrary properties. This discrepancy remains something of a\nmystery.)\n\n\nStill, it is possible to extract an interesting result from D7, when\ncombined with a result from D3. D7A1 establishes that if the one is\nnot, then the others are (D7A1C1). But D3 establishes (for\nmany F\u2019s) that if the one is, then the others\nare F. But to be F is to be in some way or other. So\nif the others are F, then the others are. So D3 establishes\n(for many F\u2019s) that if the one is, then the others are. Thus,\nD3 and D7A1C1 together entail that, whether the one is or is not, the\nothers are. Hence D3 and D7 together entail that the others\nare. Assuming that the others are (or, at least, include) all the\nforms other than the one, it follows, in conjunction with the\npreviously established result that the one is (see section 6.7 above),\nthat every form is. This reinforces the previous claim (see\nsection 6.7 again) that the result that the one is can be generalized\nto all the forms.\n",
