    "main_text": "Situationism in Philosophy || Responses to the Argument\n1.2 Responses to the Argument\n\nThe responses are organized based on whether they address the first or\nthe second stage of the Harman and Doris argument.\n1.2.1 Responses that Address Stage One\n\nThe following responses address the argument against global character\ntraits.\n\n\n\nDeficiencies of Particular Experiments for Evaluating\nCharacter. A natural question to ask is whether the experiments\ncited by Harman and Doris really do show that most people lack the\nvirtue of compassion. Several philosophers have argued that they do\nnot.\n\nFor instance, Miller (2003) raised questions about Dime in the\nPhone Booth. Serious concerns have arisen about the Zimbardo\nprison experiment, with calls to remove it from psychology textbooks\n(Blum 2018). Others have not been convinced that the Milgram\nexperiments and the Darley and Batson Princeton Seminary experiment\nshed much light on the possession of compassion (see Sreenivasan 2002:\n60\u201361; Annas 2003: 14 (see Other Internet Resources); Adams\n2006: 147; Snow 2010: 103\u2013107, 111\u2013116. For general\ndiscussion of this line of response, see Montmarquet 2003:\n365\u2013368; Russell 2009: 279\u2013287). Concerning bystander\nintervention studies like \u201cLady in Distress,\u201d it could be\nobjected that they are carried out artificially in a lab. In one of\nthe only naturalistic studies of bystander interventions ever\nconducted, Philpot and colleagues (2019) analyzed 219 CCTV video\nrecordings of aggressive behavior in public urban areas in the\nNetherlands, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. They found that,\n\u201cat least one bystander intervened in 90.9% of the situations,\nwith an average of 3.76 interveners per video,\u201d although on the\nflip side the mean number of bystanders at any given incident was\n16.29 (Philpot et al. 2019).\n\nIf a sufficient number of studies are called into question this way,\nthen stage one of the argument would not go through, and hence it\nwould not matter how exactly the second stage of the argument was\nmeant to go (for criticism of this response, see Russell 2009:\n279\u2013287). \n\n\nCompeting Virtues. This next response can be seen as a\ndifferent version of the previous one. It calls into question the\nfirst stage of the Harman/Doris argument by suggesting that the\nresults of the relevant studies are best interpreted, not as\ndemonstrating a lack of virtue, but rather as suggesting the\ncontribution of competing virtues. Or a weaker version of this\nresponse would say that, at the very least, Harman and Doris have not\ndone enough to rule out this hypothesis.\n\nFor instance, instead of saying that the standard Milgram experiment\nis evidence that most participants did not have the virtue of\ncompassion, perhaps a better interpretation is to say that their\ncompassion was being outweighed by the work of another virtue which\nseemed at the time to have greater priority (perhaps mistakenly). One\ncandidate for this virtue could be obedience. Or take the Lady in\nDistress study. Here again participants might have had their\ncompassion outweighed by another virtue, such as trust, as they\nfollowed the example of the other person in the room who did not\nrespond. Additional candidates for competing virtues could likewise be\nfound for the other studies that get mentioned in this debate (for\ndiscussion see Solomon 2003: 53, 55\u201356; Kamtekar 2004: 473;\nKristj\u00e1nsson 2008: 64\u201365; Snow 2010: 106. For criticism\nsee Harman 2003: 91; Prinz 2009: 123; Russell 2009: 282\u2013283,\n286). \n\n\nMental States are Important Too. One claim commonly made in\nthe situationist literature in psychology, was that so-called\n\u201csituational forces\u201d, as opposed to global character\ntraits or even more familiar folk mental states such as beliefs and\ndesires, are part of the best explanation for our behavior (see for\ninstance Ross and Nisbett 1991: 59; Sabini and Silver 2005:\n546\u2013554). In a paper published in the journal Ethics in\n2005, the leading psychologists John Sabini and Maury Silver engaged\nwith the work of Harman and Doris by primarily criticizing this claim.\nTheir approach was to reassess the leading studies such as Lady in\nDistress, in order to show that mental states and perhaps even\ncharacter traits are indeed central to explaining the results.\nSummarizing their view, they wrote that,\n\n\nPeople who must act in such circumstances are confused and inhibited\nby the anticipation of embarrassment, and that we argue is the lesson\nto be drawn from social psychological research. People are also, we\nsuggest, unaware of how potent fear of embarrassment is as a\nmotivation for behavior (Sabini and Silver 2005: 559).\n\n\nThus in contrast to the claim about situational forces, Sabini and\nSilver held that psychological causes such as fear of embarrassment\nare ineliminable from the best explanation and prediction of morally\nrelevant behavior. But they did accept that these studies provide\nsupport for the influence of, \u201cfeatures of the immediate\nsituation which are not in themselves of moral significance\u201d\n(2005: 561). So putting the pieces together, they seemed to hold that\npsychological dispositions do exist and constitute various character\ntraits, but those character traits end up not being virtuous (for a\nsimilar line of response, see Kupperman 2001: 245\u2013247; Solomon\n2003: 48, 56; Wielenberg 2006: 471\u2013490; for criticism see\nRussell 2009: 288; Merritt et al. 2010: 367\u2013369). \n\n\nCAPS. Philosophers such as Nancy Snow and Daniel Russell have\nmade use of the \u201ccognitive-affective personality system\u201d\nor \u201cCAPS\u201d model in psychology, in developing an\nAristotelian response to situationism (Miller 2003; Adams 2006:\n131\u2013138; Russell 2009: chapters 8\u201310; Snow 2010: chapter\n1). Because the CAPS model will be covered in the next section,\ndiscussion of this response is postponed until then. \n\n1.2.2 Responses that Address Stage Two\n\nThe remaining responses address the link from the evidence against\nglobal character traits, to the conclusion that Aristotelian virtue\nethics is problematic.\n\n\n\nRarity. Perhaps the most widely used response by defenders of\nAristotelian virtue ethics, the rarity response just denies that any\nreasonable form of the view is committed to the empirical claim that\nmost people have the virtues. Instead, virtue ethics could be true as\na normative theory while as a matter of contingent fact people in a\ngiven society are doing a poor job of acquiring the virtues (for a few\nreferences among many, see DePaul 1999: 150\u2013153; Miller 2003;\nKamtekar 2004: 466; Wielenberg 2006: 490; Russell 2009: 170; for\ncriticism of the response, see Annas 2003 (see Other Internet\nResources), 2011: 173; Russell 2009: 284).\n\nThis is not an ad hoc revision to the view designed to defend\nit against situationist challenges. Plato and Aristotle long ago\nthought that virtue is rare, as have most philosophers working on\ncharacter throughout the intervening years (see DePaul 1999 on Plato\nand Nicomachean Ethics 1099b29\u201332, 1103b16\u201331,\n1152a30\u201334, 1179b25\u201329, 1180a1\u20135, 15\u201319). As\nAristotle wrote,\n\n\nthe many naturally obey fear, not shame; they avoid what is base\nbecause of the penalties, not because it is disgraceful. For since\nthey live by their feelings, they pursue their proper pleasures and\nthe sources of them, and avoid the opposed pains, and have not even a\nnotion of what is fine and truly pleasant, since they have had no\ntaste of it (Nicomachean Ethics 1179b11\u201316).\n \n\n\nWrong Conception of Aristotelian Character. Some\nAristotelians acknowledged that Harman and Doris succeeded in raising\nproblems for the empirical adequacy of a certain picture of character\ntraits, but they complained that this picture is not a sufficiently\nnuanced and sophisticated Aristotelian one. Hence Rachana Kamtekar\nwrote,\n\n\nthe character traits conceived of as debunked by situationist social\npsychological studies have very little to do with character as it is\nconceived of in traditional virtue ethics. Traditional virtue ethics\noffers a conception of character far superior to the one under attack\nby situationism (Kamtekar 2004: 460; for similar claims, see DePaul\n1999: 149\u2013150; Kupperman 2001: 241\u2013243; Annas 2003: 13\n(see Other Internet Resources), 2011: 172\u2013176).\n\n\nKamtekar noted several differences. One is that, on the Aristotelian\npicture, virtues are supposed to be, \u201cdispositions to respond\nappropriately\u2014in judgment, feeling, and action\u2014to\none\u2019s situation\u201d (2004: 477). Furthermore, Aristotle was\nclear that they require practical wisdom, which is a\n\u201cdisposition to deliberate well about what conduces to the good\nlife in general\u201d (2004: 480). And while the virtues do require\ncross-situational consistency, this needs to be handled carefully,\nsince it is consistency relative to the individual\u2019s own outlook\non life, as shaped by her values, goals, plans, and the like. So to\noutside observers, someone might be acting very inconsistently, but\nfrom her own perspective the pattern of behavior makes perfect sense\n(2004: 485, for criticism of this response, see Adams 2006: 121; Sosa\n2009: 280\u2013283; Merritt et al. 2010: 358\u2013360). \n\n\nAristotelian Conception of Character is the Wrong Conception.\nOther participants in this discussion have shown less interest in\ndefending Aristotelian conceptions of character. Instead they wanted\nto see what non-Aristotelian accounts have to offer, and whether they\ncan better accommodate studies like those cited above. Three examples\nof philosophers who have gone in this direction are Maria Merritt, who\nsupported a Humean account, Eric Wielenberg, who supported a Kantian\naccount, and Edward Slingerland, who supported a Confucian account\n(Merritt 2000; Wielenberg 2006: 466, 469; Slingerland 2011). \n\n1.2.3 Conclusion\n\nThis is not the place to evaluate these different responses and see\nwhich if any of them is the strongest. It is important to note,\nhowever, that they should not be treated in isolation. For instance,\nsomeone might combine a first stage response such as Mental States\nare Important Too with a second stage response such as\nRarity.\n\nLet me conclude this discussion with two points. First, we should\nbriefly consider what the empirical story about character might look\nlike if we grant that most people do not have the traditional virtues.\nAfter all, philosophers can accept that conclusion without having to\naccept the arguments Harman and Doris offered drawing on the\nexperimental literature. As noted already, Plato and Aristotle both\naccepted it, as have many others.\n\nHere, then, are a few of the leading options for what a positive story\nabout most people\u2019s actual character might look like:\n\nMost people have the vices, such as dishonesty and cowardice,\nwhich are global character traits as well. Harman and Doris claim that\nthis position is empirically inadequate too, but not everyone agrees\n(Bates and Kleingeld 2018).\nMost people have local character traits, which are virtues and\nvices restricted to narrow types of situations such as the courtroom\nor the bar. Harman seems to be amenable to this position, and Doris\nexplicitly accepts it (Doris 1998: 507\u2013508, 2002: 23, 25,\n64).\nMost people have mixed character traits, which are global traits\nthat are neither good enough to qualify as virtues nor bad enough to\nqualify as vices. They are constituted by some morally positive and\nsome morally negative dispositions. Miller (2013, 2014) develops this\nposition at length.\n\n\nClearly much additional work is needed to better understand how our\ncharacters are actually put together.\n\nThe second point is that discussions in philosophy of situationism are\nshowing no signs of slowing down, even twenty years after Harman and\nDoris\u2019s original work appeared. A significant development, for\ninstance, has been to extend the debate to the epistemic virtues and\nvices, with potentially troubling implications arising for certain\nforms of virtue epistemology (Alfano 2012; Doris and Olin 2014; Alfano\nand Fairweather 2017). A number of other topics related to\nsituationism remain underexplored (for examples, see Miller 2017).\n",
