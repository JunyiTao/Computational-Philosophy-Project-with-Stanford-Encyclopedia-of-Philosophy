    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThere is a growing interest in epistemological topics and problems\namong members of what may be called, somewhat artificially, \u201cthe\nLatin American philosophical community\u201d. However, it should be\nnoted from the start that, despite the large size of that community\nand its connections with philosophers and research groups particularly\nfrom the United States and the United Kingdom, on the whole\nepistemological investigation in Latin America significantly differs\nin approach, breadth, and originality from mainstream Anglophone\nepistemology\u2014which at present can reasonably be taken as\nemblematic owing to its depth, precision, innovation, and\nfecundity.\n\nWithin Latin America, epistemology has traditionally been approached\nfrom a historico-exegetical rather than systematic perspective. Even\ntoday, it is not uncommon for an epistemology course in the philosophy\ndepartment of a Latin American university to focus (almost)\nexclusively on the views on the nature and possibility of knowledge\nfound in the works of Descartes, Hume, Kant, Husserl, Heidegger,\nMerleau-Ponty, or Ricoeur rather than on the main epistemological\npositions adopted in contemporary analytic philosophy. The reason is,\nat least in part, that most professors in charge of courses on the\ntheory of knowledge have traditionally been historians of modern\nphilosophy or phenomenologists influenced by the way philosophy has\ncustomarily been practiced in France, Germany, and Spain, thus\nfollowing the tradition of so-called continental philosophy. In the\nLatin American academic milieu, philosophy in general has\npredominantly been approached either through the exegesis of\nphilosophical texts or through the history of philosophical ideas,\nboth with a markedly continental orientation.\n\nEven though the history of analytic philosophy in Latin America starts\nin the 1950s\u20131960s (see P\u00e9rez & Ortiz-Mill\u00e1n\n2010), one had to wait until the last two decades of the twentieth\ncentury for a strong and widespread trend of analytic philosophy to\nemerge. The seminal impetus for the production and dissemination in\nLatin America (particularly in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico) of new\nwork within the analytic tradition was the founding of research\ncenters taking a distinctly analytic approach and the subsequent\nlaunches of their respective journals: the Instituto de\nInvestigaciones Filos\u00f3ficas (IIF, 1967) at the Universidad\nAut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM), with its journal\nCr\u00edtica (1967); the Sociedad Argentina de\nAn\u00e1lisis Filos\u00f3fico (SADAF, 1972) with its journal\nAn\u00e1lisis Filos\u00f3fico (1981); and the Centro de\nL\u00f3gica, Epistemologia e Hist\u00f3ria da Ci\u00eancia (CLE,\n1976) at the Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP) in Brazil,\nwith its journal Manuscrito (1977). The founding in 2007 of\nthe Asociaci\u00f3n Latinoamericana de Filosof\u00eda\nAnal\u00edtica (ALFA) reflects the sustained development of analytic\nphilosophy in Latin American countries. The recent unprecedented\nimpetus in what may be regarded as the analytic way of doing\nphilosophy explains why, since the turn of the millennium, the\nprimarily historico-exegetical and continental approach to\nepistemology has slowly started to be replaced by a systematic and\nanalytic one.\n\nWith regard to the breadth of Latin American studies in epistemology,\na considerable number of the subjects discussed in present-day\nanalytic epistemology have not received the slightest attention,\nothers have been addressed only superficially, and still others have\nbeen tackled by but a few researchers. This situation is not limited\nto relatively new areas such as the epistemology of testimony, the\nepistemology of disagreement, or collective epistemology (all falling\nwithin so-called social epistemology), but is a more general\nphenomenon. This may be due to the fact that, for some reason, in\nanalytic-style Latin American philosophy, epistemology has received\nless attention than logic, philosophy of science, or philosophy of\nlanguage.\n\nFinally, even though original positions and arguments with regard to\nspecific topics have been developed by Latin American scholars, it is\nsafe to say that there is not a distinctively Latin American\nepistemology. The epistemological issues and problems currently\nexamined in the work of those Latin American authors who adopt a\nsystematic approach either have been discussed throughout the history\nof philosophy or have been \u201cimported\u201d from Anglophone\nscholarship. Nor is there a particular way of doing epistemology that\ncould be identified as Latin American. For this reason, one may talk\nof \u201cepistemology in Latin America\u201d or \u201cepistemology\ndone by Latin Americans\u201d rather than of \u201cLatin American\nepistemology\u201d.\n\nA caveat is in order: the above is intended as a general\ndescription of the current situation in the Latin American\nphilosophical community. The academic collaboration between research\ngroups within and outside Latin America, the growing number of\nvisiting scholars from Latin American countries at philosophy\ndepartments of North America and Europe where the best epistemological\ninvestigation is carried out, and the increase of financial resources\nin some of those countries will, one can reasonably expect, change the\nsituation in the years to come by building on what has already been\ndone in the field and opening up further research and debate. Within\nthe next few decades, there will probably be a consolidated Latin\nAmerican community working on epistemological issues, and one will\nperhaps even be able to start talking of a distinctively Latin\nAmerican epistemology.\n",
