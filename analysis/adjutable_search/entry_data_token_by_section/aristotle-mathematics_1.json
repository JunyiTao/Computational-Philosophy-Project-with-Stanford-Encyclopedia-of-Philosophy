    "main_text": "The Structure of a Mathematical Science: First Principles\n2. The Structure of a Mathematical Science: First Principles\n\n\nAristotle's discussions on the best format for a deductive science in\nthe Posterior Analytics reflect the practice of contemporary\nmathematics as taught and practiced in Plato's Academy, discussions\nthere about the nature of mathematical sciences, and Aristotle's own\ndiscoveries in logic. Aristotle has two separate concerns. One evolves\nfrom his argument that there must be first, unprovable principles for\nany science, in order to avoid both circularity and infinite regresses.\nThe other evolves from his view that demonstrations must be\nexplanatory. (See subsections A, B, and C of \u00a76, Demonstrations\nand Demonstrative Sciences, of the entry\n Aristotle's logic.)\n\n\nAristotle distinguishes (Posterior Analytics i.2) Two sorts\nof starting points for demonstration, axioms and\nposits.\nAn axiom (axi\u00f4ma) is a\nstatement worthy of acceptance and is needed prior to learning\nanything. Aristotle's list here includes the most general principles\nsuch as non-contradiction and excluded middle, and principles more\nspecific to mathematicals, e.g., when equals taken from equals the\nremainders are equal. It is not clear why Aristotle thinks one needs to\nlearn mathematical axioms to learn anything, unless he means that one\nneeds to learn them to learn anything in a mathematical subject or that\naxioms are so basic that they should form the first part of one \u2018s\nlearning.\n\n\nAristotle divides posits (thesis) into two\ntypes, definitions and hypotheses:\n\n\n\nA hypothesis (hupothesis) asserts one\npart of a contradiction, e.g., that something is or is not.\n\n\nA definition (horismos) does not assert\neither part of a contradiction (or perhaps is without the assertion of\nexistence or non-existence).\n\n\n\nSince a definition does not assert or deny, Aristotle probably\nintends us to understand definitions as stipulations or as defining\nexpressions which are equivalent in some way to the defined term. The\ndefinition of unit as \u2018indivisible in quantity\u2019 will not\npresuppose that units do or do not exist. Hence, the syllogistic\npremise, \u2018A unit is indivisibile in quantity,\u2019 if taken as\npresupposing the existence of units, will not be a definition in this\nsense. Later, of course, Aristotle will allow for many other kinds of\ndefinitions.\n\n\nThere are many views as to what Aristotle's hypotheses are: (i)\nexistence claims, (ii) any true assumption within a science, and (iii)\nthe stipulation of objects at the beginning of a typical proof in Greek\nmathematics. Examples might be, \u2018Let A be a unit,\u2019\n(where the object is stipulated to be a unit) or, more\ncharacteristically of Greek mathematics, \u2018Let there be a line\nAB\u2019 (where a line is stipulated to exist, namely\nAB). In fact, all these interpretations may have a modicum of\nwhat Aristotle means. In that case, Aristotle implies that any\nassumption within a science that asserts or denies something is a\nhypothesis. However, he singles out existence claims. How do existence\nclaims work in Aristotle's conceptions of science? From\nPhysics iv, we have claims such as \u2018There is\nplace,\u2019 and \u2018There is no void.\u2019 However, the examples\nthat Aristotle uses in the Posterior Analytics are claims such\nas that the genus exists, or specifically that there are units, or that\nthere are points and lines. Aristotle also points out that sometimes\nthe hypothesis of the genus is omitted as too obvious. Only by\ncomparing these general claims with their use in Aristotelian\nmathematics can we get a sense of what Aristotle means. Aristotle\nintends us to understand that prior to the demonstrations in a\nscientific treatise, the treatise should state starting propositions.\nThese include general claims broader than the science, definitions\nwhich are stated as stipulations and not as assertions, and a claim\nthat the basic entities \u2018exist\u2019. What counts as an\nacceptable existence claim is relative to the actual science. The\nopening of a proof, \u2018Let there be a line AB,\u2019 is\nan application of the basic hypothesis of the science. Since Aristotle\nregards such proofs through particular lines as general proofs, the\nopening claim is actually to be understood as standing for the general\nclaim that there are lines. This is how the hypothesis is used as a\npremise. The stipulation, \u2018Let there be a triangle\nABC,\u2019 would not be a hypothesis on this interpretation,\nsince he holds that the existence of triangles is to be proved, so that\nthis instantiates a derived proposition.\n\n\nA science consists of a genus (genos),\nwhat the science is about, and a collection of attributes, what the\nscience says about the genus. The genus or kind is both defined and\nhypothesized to exist. From his examples (points and lines for\ngeometry), it would seem that the genus is to be understood loosely as\nthe fundamental entities in the science. The attributes are defined but\nare not hypothesized as existing. One must prove that the attributes\nbelong to various members of the genus. For example, one must prove\nthat triangles exist, e.g., that some [constructible] figures are\ntriangles.\n\n\nIf we take very seriously the common view that Aristotle claims that\nevery immediate premise of a demonstration expresses something about an\nexisting entity, then one may well wonder how the principles of\ndemonstration, axioms and posits, can be premises of demonstrations.\nExistence claims and stipulations do not express something about an\nexisting entity. Since Aristotle calls the axioms, \u2018those from\nwhich (demonstration arises),\u2019 some have suggested that the\naxioms alone form the premises for a science and that a proof in any\nscience arises by placing genus terms and their definitions in the\naxioms and then substituting terms like \u2018triangle\u2019 for\ntheir definitions when they arise in proofs. However, besides pointing\nto the inadequacy of the axioms for this job, it may be objected that\nAristotle also calls the principles of demonstration immediate\nstatements protaseis), i.e., axioms and posits. Another\npossibility is that he regards even stipulations and existence claims\nas premises, as well as other hypotheses, but treats the axioms as\nsomehow more fundamentally the source of proofs. In this case, he has a\nlooser conception of what counts as a premise than many readers would\nexpect. In any case, if his proof theory is to work at all, he must\nallow many more immediate premises than one would find in the\nintroduction to a standard text of ancient Greek mathematics.\n\n\nFor more information, see the following supplementary document:\nAristotle and First Principles in Greek Mathematics\n",
