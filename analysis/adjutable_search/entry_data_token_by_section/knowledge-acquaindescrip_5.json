Acquaintance, Thought, and A Priori Knowledge\n\nSo far we have been talking primarily about the role of acquaintance\nin securing a special kind of knowledge. There is, however, another\ncrucial role acquaintance has been thought to play. For philosophers\nlike Russell, acquaintance secures not only the objects of knowledge\nbut the objects of thought itself; it explains not only how knowledge\nis possible, but also how thought is possible. This is so not just for\na special class of thoughts about experiences or experiential\nqualities as some hold (see\n section 3.2,\n on demonstrative and phenomenal concepts), but for thought in\ngeneral. The idea actually goes back to the empiricists who claimed\nthat all simple ideas have their source in experience. When refined\nthe suggestion probably amounted to the view that all simple ideas are\nderived from objects or properties with which we are acquainted or of\nwhich we are directly aware. On Russell\u2019s version of the view,\nwhenever you form a thought, the components of that thought are items\nwith which you are acquainted:\n\n\nEvery proposition which we can understand must be composed\nwholly of constituents with which we are acquainted.\n(1912: Ch. 5) \n\n\nYou can, to be sure, think of Jack the Ripper, but the thought when\nanalyzed is broken down into constituents each of which is something\nwe can apprehend directly. The name \u201cJack the Ripper\u201d gets\nreduced to a description embedded in a quantified statement. The\nthought that Jack the Ripper is vicious just is the thought\nthat there exists one and only one individual who has certain\nproperties\u2014e.g., who is the most famous 19th Century\nmurderer\u2014and who also has the property of being\nvicious. Russell has always struggled with the question of how to view\nour understanding of the quantifier\u2014expressions of quantity such\nas \u2018a\u2019 or \u2018the\u2019\u2014but it is clear that he\nbelieved that we have the capacity to entertain in thought (directly)\nthe properties (universals) picked out by predicate expressions. If\nhaving a thought essentially involves acquaintance with universals,\nthen it ceases to be a mystery how thought can represent the world,\nsince the world partly consists in instances or exemplifications of\nuniversals; and if a thought involves acquaintance with universals\nthat happen to be instantiated or exemplified by some object of\nacquaintance, then it makes sense that one can, at least in some\ncases, directly compare and become acquainted with the correspondence\nor fit between the two. \n\nThe acquaintance theorist is in a position to offer a different gloss\non the traditional distinction between\n a priori knowledge\n of necessary truth and a posteriori or empirical knowledge\nof contingent truth. On the classical acquaintance theory, knowledge\nof both truths has the same source\u2014acquaintance with facts. The\ndistinction lies with the objects of acquaintance. When I am\nacquainted with my being in pain, that can give me knowledge of the\ncontingent truth that I\u2019m in pain. When I am acquainted with the\nproperty of being red, the property of being yellow and the relation\nof being darker than holding between them, that can give me knowledge\nof the necessary truth that red is darker than yellow. When I am\nacquainted with being triangular and being trilateral and the relation\nof inclusion holding between them, that can give me knowledge of the\nnecessary truth that triangles are trilateral. When I am acquainted\nwith being a circle, and having corners, and the relation of exclusion\nbetween them, that can give me knowledge of the necessary truth that\ncircles have no corners. For similar views of the nature of thought\nand the a priori, see Bealer (1982: Ch. 8, especially\n187\u201390) and BonJour (1998: Ch. 6). \n",
