    "main_text": "\n\nLike the philosophy of science in general, the philosophy of biology\nhas traditionally been mostly concerned with theories. For a variety\nof reasons, the theory that has by far attracted the most interest is\nevolutionary theory. There was a period in the philosophy of biology\nwhen this field was almost identical with the philosophy of\nevolutionary theory, especially if debates on the nature of species\nare included in this area. From the 1960s almost until the 1990s,\nbasically the only non-evolutionary topic discussed was the issue of\nthe reduction (or non-reduction) of classical genetics to molecular\ngenetics. In the 1990s, practitioners of the field finally started to\nmove into other areas of biology such as cell biology, molecular\nbiology, immunology, neuroscience, as well as addressing philosophical\nissues other than theory reduction (e.g., Darden 1991; Burian 1992,\n1997; Schaffner 1993; Bechtel and Richardson 1993; Rheinberger 1997).\nAs these are profoundly experimental disciplines, an increased\nattention to the experiment in biology was inevitable. Thus, what is\ngenerally known as the \u201cNew Experimentalism\u201d in general\nphilosophy of science arose more or less independently in the\nphilosophy of biology, even though this fact has not been advertised\nmuch. Perhaps, the increased focus on experimentation was more due to\nthe influence of historians of biology and their practical turn than\ndue to the \u201cNew Experimentalists\u201d in general philosophy of\nscience such as Hacking (1983), Franklin (1986) or Mayo (1996). At any\nrate, today there is a wealth of historical as well as philosophical\nscholarship that closely studies what goes on in biological\nlaboratories. Some of this literature relates to classical issues in\nphilosophy of science, but it has also explored new philosophical\nground.\n\nThere are issues in the philosophy of biological experimentation that\nalso arise in other experimental sciences, for example, issues that\nhave to do with causal inference, experimental testing, the\nreliability of data, the problem of experimental artifacts, and the\nrationality of scientific practice. Experimental biological knowledge\nis sufficiently different from other kinds of scientific knowledge to\nmerit a separate philosophical treatment of these issues. In addition,\nthere are issues that arise exclusively in biology, such as the role\nof model organisms. In what follows, both kinds of issues will be\nconsidered.\n",
