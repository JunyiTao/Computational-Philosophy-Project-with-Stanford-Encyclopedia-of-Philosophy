    "main_text": "Origins of Evil: Moral and Natural || Natural Evil\n4.2 Natural Evil\n\nNatural evil refers to metaphysical and/or empirical evils\nwhose origins are \u201cnatural\u201d\u2014i.e., grounded in the\nnatures of things and/or the natural laws. The very nature of a horse\nmakes it incapable of language: if that incapacity is a metaphysical\nevil (as it would be on Absence Theory), then given its origin it also\ncounts as a natural rather than a moral evil. Likewise, cancer,\npandemics, earthquakes, meteor strikes, aging and perhaps even death\nitself are (typically) regarded as natural rather than moral evils. In\nthe tradition there are characterizations of natural evil that use one\nor more of the four templates discussed earlier: Absence,\nPrivation, malfunctions in Matter, or some other\nReal Property.\n\nOutside of religious contexts, however, many philosophers (and people\ngenerally) will be reluctant to characterize hurricanes, diseases, and\nmeteor strikes as a source of \u201cevil\u201d. The very idea of\nnatural evil seems most at home in theological debates: can\nthe Author of Nature be supremely good, wise, and powerful and yet\nstill create a world that contains so much pain and suffering, not to\nmention Category Five hurricanes, animal predation, and\nAlzheimer\u2019s Disease?\n\nThere are different kinds of responses to the problem of natural evil\nin theological traditions: Aesthetic responses say that we\ndon\u2019t presently have the right perspective to see the overall\nbeauty of the natural system, and thus that there really is no natural\nevil; Soul-making responses say that this present vale of\nnatural evil is justified because it gives us the chance to become\nvirtuous; Skeptical theistic responses say that given our\nlimited faculties we cannot reasonably expect to understand\nwhy God would allow natural evils. (For more on these responses see M.\nAdams 1998, Tooley 2002 [2019]).\n\nA very different kind of response involves recharacterizing at least\nsome natural evils as moral evils. For instance, we might focus on\nways in which human activity has set in motion the kinds of\nenvironmental, climatic, microbial, and biospheric changes that lead\nto \u201cnatural\u201d disasters, pandemics, famines, and other\nempirical evils. Or, in a more religious context, we might seek to\nexplain the suffering and misery caused by \u201cnature\u201d by\nappeal to sin, karmic law, or divine justice.\n\nOn some versions of this view, the morally responsible agent can be\nsomeone other than the victim: Adam sins, and now the non-human\n\u201ccreation has been growning\u201d (Romans 8:22,\nNRSV)\u2014and makes the rest of us groan along with it. Or: we emit\nthe greenhouse gasses, and our descendants three generations later\nsuffer.\n\nOther versions insist that the fault lies with the victim of natural\nevil himself: Eliphaz the Temanite says to Job\n\n\nThink now, who that was innocent ever perished?\n\nOr where were the upright cut off?\n\nAs I have seen, those who plow iniquity\n\nand sow trouble reap the same.\n\nBy the breath of God they perish,\n\nand by the blast of his anger they are consumed.\n\nThe roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion,\n\nand the teeth of the young lions are broken.\n\n(Job 4: 7\u201310, NRSV)\n\n\nEliphaz suggests that if Job continues to suffer, then there must be\nsome explanation for these natural evils in Job\u2019s own past\nbehavior. The risk in this kind of doctrine will be obvious to less\nancient sensibilities: to suggest that a victim of natural evil must\nbe morally responsible for it seems like the very definition of adding\ninsult to injury.\n\nAnother way to recharacterize natural evil as moral evil is by\nappealing to the actions of moral agents who are neither divine nor\nhuman. This appears to have been Augustine\u2019s position in places;\nmore recently, it has been invoked by Alvin Plantinga as an at least\nbroadly logically possible scenario which could be used in a\n\u201cdefense\u201d against the logical problem of evil (Tooley 2002\n[2019]). The scenario says that\n\n\n[n]atural evil is due to the free actions of nonhuman persons; there\nis a balance of good over evil with respect to the actions of these\nnonhuman persons; and it was not within the power of God to create a\nworld that contains a more favorable balance of good over evil with\nrespect to the actions of the nonhuman persons it contains. (Plantinga\n1989: 58)\n\n\nA final way to recharacterize natural evil as moral would simply be to\nhold God alone morally blameworthy for it, since God created\na world in which sentient creatures suffer so terribly. Obviously this\nwould not be a winning strategy if the goal is a successful theodicy.\nIndeed, some theistic traditions block this route a priori by\nsaying that it is conceptually impossible for God to do wrong: a\nperfect creator is either unbound by moral principles, or essentially\nincapable of violating them (see Murphy 2017).\n\nIf these efforts to locate a moral basis for natural evil (whether\nempirical or metaphysical) are unsuccessful, then\n\u201cnatural\u201d remains a distinct category of evil\u2019s\norigin.\n\nHere again is our Table of Evils, now with more examples that go\nbeyond Nietzsche\u2019s horse case:\n\n\n\n\nOrigins:\nNatural\nMoral\nSpooky non-agential \n\nKinds:\n\u00a0\n\n\nMetaphysical\nThe finitude and other limitations that are essential to an\nindividual or species-nature and that are ultimately based in facts\nabout natures.\nThe finitude, limitations, and corruption that are essential to\nan individual or species-nature and the result of damage to natures,\nwhich damage is ultimately based in facts about immoral acts and\nintentions (e.g., Original Sin)\nThe finitude, limitations, and corruption that are essential to\nan individual or species-nature and are ultimately based in facts\nabout a dark force or shadow-side principle in reality. \n\nEmpirical\nPain, suffering, and illness (including mental) whose ultimate\nexplanation consists in causal facts (e.g., aging, accidents, genetic\ndefects, disasters and other natural phenomena).\nPain, suffering, and illness (including mental) whose ultimate\nexplanation consists in facts about immoral acts and intentions (e.g.,\ninterpersonal violence, social ills, self-harm)\nPain, suffering, and illness (including mental) whose ultimate\nexplanation consists in facts about a dark force or shadow-side\nprinciple in reality.  \n\n\nFigure 2. The Table of Evils, with\ngeneral examples\n\n\nSome types of evil do not seem to fit nicely in the Table of Evils.\nThe three dealt with in what follows are systemic evil, symbolic\nevil, and radical evil. The nature and the origins of\nsuch evils are difficult to discern, and may require an expansion of\nthe Table.\n",
