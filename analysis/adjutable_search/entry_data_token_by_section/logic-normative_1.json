    "main_text": "The normative status of what? || Characterizing logical consequence in terms of its normative role\n1.1 Characterizing logical consequence in terms of its normative role\n\nOne may approach the question of the normativity of logic by\ntaking the notions of logical consequence and of validity to be settled\nand to then investigate how these (and perhaps related) notions\nconstrain our attitudes towards the propositions standing in various\nlogical relations to one\n another.[1]\n An alternative approach has it that logic\u2019s normative role in\nthinking or reasoning may be partly definitive of what logic is.\nHartry Field, for one, advances an account of validity along the\nlatter lines. In his 2015, he argues that neither the standard model-\nor proof-theoretic accounts of validity nor the notion of necessary\ntruth-preservation in virtue of logical form succeed in capturing the notion of validity. More\nspecifically, neither of these approaches is capable of capturing the\nnotion of validity in a way that does justice to logical disputes,\ni.e., debates over which logical system is the correct one. On the\nstandard approaches to validity, such disputes are reduced to merely\nverbal disputes inasmuch as \u201cvalidity\u201d is defined relative\nto the system of logic in question. No one, of course, ever disputed\nthat a given classical argument form is valid relative to the notion\nof validity-in-classical logic, where as an intuitionistically valid\nargument is valid relative to the notion of validity-in-intuitionistic\nlogic. The problem is that there is no neutral notion of validity one\ncould appeal to that would enable one to make sense of logical\ndisputes as genuine debates, which, arguably, they are. What is needed\nto capture the substantive nature of these disputes, therefore, is a\nworkable non-partisan notion of validity, one that is not internal to\nany particular system of logic. The key to availing ourselves of such\nan ecumenical notion of validity, Field claims, resides in its\nconceptual role. The conceptual role of the notion of\nvalidity, in turn, is identified with the way in which a\nvalid argument normatively constrains an agent\u2019s doxastic\nattitudes. Roughly, in the case of full belief, in accepting an\nargument as valid, the agent is bound by the norm that she ought not\nbelieve the argument\u2019s premises while at the same time not\nbelieving its conclusion. In other words, validity\u2019s conceptual\nrole resides (at least in part) in the normative role played by valid\narguments in reasoning. Note that Field is not proposing\nto define validity in terms of its normative role. The notion\nof validity, Field contends, is best taken to be primitive. But even\nonce we take it to be primitive, it still stands in need of\nclarification. It is this clarificatory work that is done by a\ncharacterization of validity\u2019s conceptual role. And it is in\nthis sense that the normative role of logic is supposed to\ncharacterize the very nature of validity (understood as a notion\nshared by various distinct logics).\n\nIn a similar vein, John MacFarlane (2004, Other Internet Resources;\nhenceforth cited as MF2004) contends that a fuller understanding of\nhow logical consequence normatively constrains reasoning may help us\nsettle long-standing issues in the philosophy of logic, debates surrounding the\nvery nature of validity. Attempts at resolving such questions have\nbeen thwarted because of their suspect methodology: they relied on the\nunreliable (because theory-laden) testimony of our intuitions about\nvalidity. Appealing to the normative role of logic, MacFarlane hopes,\nwould give us a new angle of attack and hence a potentially better\nhandle on these vexed questions. MacFarlane, too, may therefore be\nread as suggesting that a proper account of logic\u2019s normative\nrole in reasoning will ultimately enable us to hone in on the correct\nconception of logical consequence. As examples MacFarlane considers\nthe dispute between advocates of relevantist restrictions of the\nnotion validity and those who reject such restrictions (see entry\n relevance logic),\n and the question of the formality of logical validity (see entry\n logical consequence).  The\n hope, in other words, is that an account of the normative role of\n logic, will help us pin down the correct concept of validity. In this\n respect, then, MacFarlane\u2019s project may be thought to be more\n ambitious than Field\u2019s whose aim is to provide a logic-neutral\n core concept of validity in terms of its normative role. For\n MacFarlane a correct account of the normativity of logic would\n constitute a potential avenue through which logical disputes may be\n decided; for Field such an account merely renders such disputes\n intelligible and so serves as a starting point for their\n resolution.[2]\n\n\nA potential problem with approaches like Field\u2019s and\nMacFarlane\u2019s is that logical consequence does not appear to have\na unique normative profile that sets it apart from other, non-logical\nconsequence relations. For instance, that one ought not believe each\nmember of a set of premises while at the same time not believing (or\ndisbelieving) its conclusion, is a feature that logical consequence\nseems to share with strict implication. At least in one sense of\n\u201cought\u201d, I ought to believe that this is colored, if I\nbelieve it to be red, just as much as I ought to believe \\(A\\), if I\nbelieve \\(A \\land B\\). If the general principles characterizing\nlogic\u2019s normative role fail to discriminate logical\nconsequence among other types of consequence, we cannot identify the\nconceptual role of validity with its normative role as Field\nproposes. We cannot do so, at least, unless we impose further\nconditions to demarcate properly logical consequence (see entry\n logical constants).\n The problem discussed here was raised (albeit in a different context)\nby Harman (1986: 17\u201320) when he argues that logic is not\n\u201cspecially relevant to reasoning\u201d. One response, of\ncourse, is simply to concede the point and so to simply broaden the\nscope of the inquiry: Instead of asking how logic (narrowly construed)\nnormatively constrains us, we might ask how strict implication\n(Streumer 2007) or perhaps a priori implication\n does.[3]\n A further response is that neither Field nor MacFarlane are committed\nto demarcating logic or carving out any \u201cspecial\u201d role for\nit. Their principles are left-to-right conditionals: the existence of\na logical entailment gives rise to a normative constraint on doxastic\nattitudes. One can thus question the operative notion of entailment by\nquestioning the normative constraint. This, it might reasonably be\nmaintained, is all that Field and MacFarlane need for their\npurposes.\n",
