    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nMeister Eckhart, also known as Eckhart of Hochheim, was born around\n1260, most likely in or near the German village of Tambach near the\nThuringian capital of Erfurt, where he probably entered into the\nDominican order sometime during his late teenage years. It is unclear\nwhere Eckhart completed his initial studies, but the obvious influence\nof Albert the Great on his intellectual formation indicates that he\nmay have studied in Cologne sometime before Albert\u2019s death in\n1280 (Sturlese 2013: 125\u201326). What is certain is that Eckhart\neventually made his way to study theology in Paris, where he was made\na lecturer on Peter Lombard\u2019s Sentences in 1293. Fresh\nfrom the university at Paris, the new baccalaureus theologiae\nreturned to Erfurt in 1293\u20134, this time as the prior of the\nDominican monastery where he had spent his early years.\n\nIn 1302, Eckhart was called to return to Paris for two years to occupy\nthe external Dominican chair as magister actu regens, a\nposition considered the pinnacle of academic success in the medieval\nscholastic world, after which he was called back to Erfurt to serve as\nthe provincial for the newly-established province of Saxony. There he\nwas charged with the oversight and administration of at least 47\nconvents and monasteries in Eastern and Northern Germany and the Low\nCountries. During this time, he established three new convents for\nwomen and was additionally appointed general vicar of Bohemia. Yet\nEckhart remained as much an academic as an administrator, and the\nstatus he enjoyed as a scholar and teacher is reflected by the fact\nthat, in 1311, he was called back to Paris to serve a second term as\nmagister, a distinction previously only granted to Thomas\nAquinas (McGinn 2001: 2ff.; Ruh 1996: 239ff.). In the summer of 1313,\nEckhart left Paris for Strasbourg in the Alsace region to function as\nthe special vicar for the Dominican Master General. Over the next\ndecade, he had close contact with several female convents, as well as\nwith the growing communities of Beguines in the region, and he is\nrecorded as having made personal visits to the convents of St.\nKatharinental, \u00d6tenbach, and Unterlinden (McGinn 2001: 10). It is\nnot unlikely that his encounter with these female religious\ncommunities played a role in Eckhart\u2019s increasing focus on his\nvernacular preaching during this period (Largier 1998), and some\nscholars (e.g., Milem 2013) have even proposed that many of the\nMeister\u2019s German sermons were aimed at a female audience\ninterested in pursuing unitive and/or ecstatic religious experiences,\nthough the exclusivity and aims of his audience in this respect is\n(rightly) considered controversial (cf. Wegener 2013).\n\nEver the scholar, however, Eckhart left Strasbourg sometime between\n1323\u201324 to return to the German center of Dominican learning,\nCologne (Senner 2013). In the years that followed, he was presented\nwith several lists of purportedly heretical ideas and passages he had\nwritten or preached. The first list, presented to him in 1325 by\nNicholas of Strasbourg (who was otherwise generally supportive of\nEckhart\u2019s preaching), likely contained passages from the\nBook of Divine Consolation drawn up by two\n\u201crenegade\u201d Dominicans, Hermann of Summo and William of\nNideggen, who only accused Eckhart of heresy after themselves being\naccused of corruption (Tobin 1986: 11; Senner 2013: 50\u201352). In\nresponse, Eckhart appears to have written a now-lost treatise, the\nRequisitus, that satisfied Nicholas for the time being.\nWilliam was eventually reassigned to a priory in Aachen, while Hermann\nwas later found guilty of being a false accuser (among other, more\nserious crimes) and imprisoned in the priory jail, but it would appear\nthat both of them would manage to dodge their punishments and continue\nto accuse Eckhart of heresy (Senner 2013: 52\u201353). In 1326 they\npresented the Archbishop of Cologne Henry II of Virneburg (who was\nsignificantly less sympathetic to Eckhart\u2019s cause than Nicholas)\nwith their list of 74 purportedly heretical propositions from\nEckhart\u2019s Latin and German works. A further list from the German\nsermons seems to have been drawn up later, and there may have been\nsubsequent lists (Tobin 1986: 10). On September 26, 1326, Eckhart\nappeared before the diocesan inquisitorial commission to speak to the\ncharges of heresy in a trial that, as Bernard McGinn notes, was\n\u201cunprecedented\u201d for the late middle ages (McGinn 2001:\n15). In his defense at these proceedings, Eckhart cleverly appealed to\nthe distinction between intellect and will central to the debates\nbetween the Franciscans and the Dominicans. Even if he were in error\nregarding certain theological statements, he maintained, this was\nmerely an intellectual failure and could not by itself amount\nto his having committed heresy, since the latter is, properly\nunderstood, a volitional matter (Senner 2013: 61; McGinn\n2001: 15). Eckhart thereby publicly declared that he was willing to\nretract any and all errors the commission might find.\n\nIn the Spring of 1327, Eckhart set off for the papal court at Avignon\nto appeal directly to the pope, who set up a commission of theologians\nto examine the lists from the Cologne hearings. By this point, the\nconcern was no longer whether Eckhart was a heretic (perhaps\ndue to the careful distinction he had drawn in his earlier defense)\nbut rather to determine the orthodoxy of the propositions\nthemselves. The list was ultimately reduced to 28 propositions, all of\nwhich were eventually deemed by the commission to be as\n\u201cheretical as the words sound\u201d (LW V:569), indicating that\nits members were inclined to take the propositions literally and out\nof context, despite Eckhart\u2019s protestations that he had been\nmisunderstood (Senner 2013: 75\u201376). These articles range from\nthe claim that the world has existed from eternity to the idea that\nGod\u2019s glory is also revealed in evil to assertions that God is\nglorified in those who renounce the pursuit of inwardness, holiness,\nreward, or heaven. Many of the articles center on claims that hint at\nnotions of apotheosis, deification, and/or the identification of the\nhuman soul with the (or a) Son of God. (For a full list, see EE\n77\u201381 and MW 26\u201328.)\n\nThe commission\u2019s findings, however, were merely a recommendation\nto the pope, and unfortunately, by the time the pope\u2019s official\nconsistorium with the cardinals was able to take place,\nEckhart had fallen ill and most likely died on January 28, 1328\n(Senner 1997). On March 27, 1329, Pope John XXII issued the bull\nIn agro dominico, which followed the commission\u2019s\nrecommendation in condemning all 28 articles, but ordered them\naccording to various levels of severity, eleven of them being merely\nclaimed to be \u201clikely misunderstood\u201d. The bull was sent to\nCologne with the order that it be published, so that\n\n\nthe hearts of the simple [people to whom Eckhart had preached such\narticles] which are easily seduced [\u2026] may not be filled with\nthe errors contained in them. (LW V:602; quoted in Senner 2013:\n84)\n\n\nNowhere in the bull or its accompanying documents, however, was\nMeister Eckhart himself ever declared a heretic.\n",
