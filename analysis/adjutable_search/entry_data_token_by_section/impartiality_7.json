    "main_text": "Moral impartiality II: Deontological moral theories || Deontological impartiality and the personal point of view\n4.1 Deontological impartiality and the personal point of view\n\nIn section 3.2 we noted that while consequentialist impartiality is\none possible interpretation of the demand that morality be impartial,\nit is not by any means the only available interpretation; nor is it\nclearly the most plausible. The considerations related to justice\ndiscussed in section 3.3 may help us to appreciate this. For consider\nonce more the position of the framed innocent, whose fundamental\ninterests have been sacrificed for the sake of the greater good. Such\na person may well complain that he has not been treated\nimpartially, in the appropriate sense; for, while it is true that his\ninterests were counted in determining the nature of the overall good,\nit is nevertheless also true that ultimately, he became the victim of\na form of abuse that was both harsh and undeserved. The framed\ninnocent might also back up his complaint by making the plausible\nclaim that, had he been in a position to choose, he would never have\nconsented to a moral system that allowed anyone to be\naccorded such treatment. Thus, while there is a sense in which his\ninterests were counted equally, there is another and very important\nsense in which his interests \u2013 and perhaps more importantly, his\nclaims and rights \u2013 do not seem to have received full or\nadequate consideration at all.\n\nMany deontologists insist that consequentialism errs by failing to\naccord proper significance to the moral agent as an individual; in\nJohn Rawls\u2019 words, consequentialism \u201cdoes not take\nseriously the distinction between persons\u201d (Rawls 1971, section\n5). (Rawls has utilitarianism in particular as his target, but the\npoint applies more widely.) Paul Hurley writes, \u201cMorality\nenslaves us to the impersonal standpoint unless we recognize the\nindependent moral significance of persons. Recognition of the moral\nsignificance that persons have independent of their impersonal moral\nsignificance is necessary both to secure the rational authority of\nmoral requirements and to fend off enslavement of the agent to the\nimpersonal standpoint by morality\u201d (Hurley 2009, 178). And\nSamuel Scheffler suggests that \u201cfor human beings as creatures\nwith values, the normative force of certain forms of partiality is\nnearly unavoidable. If that is right, then for morality to reject\npartiality in a general or systematic way would be for it to set\nitself against our nature as valuing creatures. And that, I believe,\nwould make morality an incoherent enterprise\u201d (Scheffler\n2010).\n\nThus, the fact that consequentialist impartiality makes extraordinary\nand, to many, unreasonable demands on the individual (section 3.2)\nmight be taken to indicate that consequentialism fails to take\nindividuals seriously as agents. At the same time, the fact\nthat consequentialist impartiality permits the individual to be used\nas a mere means when doing so promotes the greater good (section\n3.3)might indicate that consequentialism fails to take individuals\nseriously as patients. The conception of impartiality that\ntends to be favored by deontologists avoids such implications by\nrefusing to view impartial action simply as a matter of maximizing\ninterests (or some other version of the impersonally determined good.)\nDeontologists take the right rather than the good to\nbe fundamental to ethics, and tend to see moral action in terms of\nacting in accordance with principles that are rationally acceptable to\nall.\n\nExactly what these principles are, and exactly what method should be\nused to determine them, are matters of some disagreement among\ndeontological theorists. But there does seem to be a general consensus\namong deontologists that moral impartiality does not require\nthat an agent be strictly neutral between her own good and the good of\nother people in ordinary decision-making contexts. Rather, an agent is\npermitted on deontological views to give special attention to her own\nprojects and interests. Impartiality might be required in certain\nspecial contexts\u2014for instance, when one is serving on a hiring\ncommittee or a jury, grading student papers, or designing\nlegislation\u2014but it is not seen as a general and pervasive\nrequirement applying to everyday decisions and behavior. In one sense,\nthis places a limit on impartiality\u2019s scope and demands; but it\nis compatible with viewing impartiality as having a central and\nirreducible role in morality. After all, on many deontological views\nthe rules and principles permitting partiality at the everyday level\n(to oneself, to friends and relatives, to one\u2019s own projects,\netc.) are justified in terms that appeal directly to impartial\nconsiderations. It might be claimed, for instance, that\neveryone\u2019s autonomy and dignity\u2014which are\nunderstood as moral features possessed equally by all\u2014are best\nrespected by adopting a set of moral rules and practices according to\nwhich each person is permitted to carve out a space for their own\nprojects and relationships, within which the requirement to be\nimpartial does not generally apply. This is just to say that\nfirst-order partiality is compatible with second-order\nimpartiality (Barry 1995; see also Hooker 2010).\n\nThe fact that deontological theories generally permit (some degree of)\nfirst-order partiality \u2013 that is, that agents are permitted to\npay special attention to their own interests, projects, and loved ones\n\u2013 should not, then, be taken to imply either that the\nagent\u2019s interests are objectively more valuable than\nthose of other persons, or that the agent is justified in viewing them\nas such. Rather, the deontologist will claim, it reflects the fact\nthat it is morally legitimate (perhaps, again, because justifiable in\nsecond-order impartialist terms) for an agent to regard her own goals\nand interests as especially important to her. Thus,\ndeontological moral systems tend to incorporate an irreducible element\nof agent-relativity of a sort that consequentialist theories reject\n(Nagel 1986; McNaughton & Rawling 1992, 1993, 1998; Jollimore\n2001; Kamm 2007 ).\n\nThe incorporation of agent-relativity of this sort into deontological\ntheories allows such theories to escape the most straightforward\nversions of the claim that they demand too much of moral agents.\nNevertheless, various versions of that objection have been leveled\nagainst deontological theories. It has been claimed, for instance,\nthat Kantianism, by insisting that only actions performed out of the\nmotive of duty have moral worth, delegitimizes or even forbids the\ntype of motives which typically (and perhaps necessarily) operate in\nthe context of close personal relationships (Stocker 1976; Williams;\n1981). Typically, Kantians have responded by distancing themselves\nfrom the view that only actions motivated by duty have value,\nand acknowledging instead that a commitment to duty need only function\nas a limiting condition, rather than as the primary source of\nmotivation in all cases (Baron 1995). The Kantian account of moral\nvalue, of course, is not essential to deontological theories; and\nthose theories which eschew it may well be able to avoid the\ndemandingness objection altogether.\n",
