    "main_text": "The Null Support Thesis || Endorsement Novelty and the Confirmation of Background Beliefs\n6.8 Endorsement Novelty and the Confirmation of Background Beliefs\n\nBarnes (2005a, 2008) maintains that predictivism is frequently a\nmanifestation of a phenomenon he calls \u2018epistemic\npluralism\u2019. A \u2018T-evaluator\u2019 (a scientist who\nassigns some probability to theory T) is an epistemic pluralist\ninsofar as she regards one form of evidence to be the probabilities\nposted (i.e. publicly presented) by other scientists for and against\nT and other relevant claims (she is an epistemic individualist\nif she does not do this but considers only the scientific evidence\n\u2018on her own\u2019). One form of pluralistic evidence is the\nevent in which a reputable scientist endorses a theory\u2014this\ntakes place when a scientist posts a probability for T that is\n(1) no lower than the evaluator\u2019s probability and (2) high\nenough that subsequent predictive confirmation of T would\nredound to the scientist\u2019s credibility (2008: 2.2). \n\nBarnes rejects the heuristic conception of novelty on the grounds that\nit is a mistake to think that what matters epistemically is the\nprocess by which the theory was constructed\u2014what matters is on\nwhat basis the theory was endorsed (2008: 33f) . In the example above,\nconfirmation of N (a consequence of T) could carry\nspecial weight for an evaluator who learned that the theorist endorsed\nthe theory without appeal to observational evidence for N\n(irrespective of how the theory was constructed). He proposes to\nreplace the heuristic conception with his endorsement conception of\nnovelty: N (a known consequence of T) counts as a novel\nconfirmation of T relative to agent X insofar as\nX posts an endorsement-level probability for T that is\nbased on a body of evidence that does not include observation-based\nevidence for N. \n\nBarnes claims that the notion of endorsement novelty has several\nadvantages over the heuristic conception\u2014one is that endorsement\nnovelty can account for the fact that prediction is a matter of\ndegree: the more strongly the theorist endorses T, the more\nstrongly its consequence N is predicted (and thus the more\nevidence for T for pluralist evaluators who trust the\nendorser). Another is that the orthodox distinction between the\ncontext of discovery and the context of justification is preserved.\nAccording to the latter distinction, it does not matter for purposes\nof theory evaluation how a theory was discovered. But this turns out\nnot to be true on the heuristic conception given the central\nimportance it accords to how a theory was built (cf. Leplin 1987).\nEndorsement novelty respects the irrelevance of the process by which\ntheories are discovered (Barnes 2008: 37\u20138). \n\nOne claim central to this account is that confirmation is a three-way\nrelation between theory, evidence, and background belief (cf. Good\n1967). Barnes distinguishes between two types of theory endorser: (1)\nvirtuous endorsers post probabilities for theories that cohere with\ntheir evidence and background beliefs and (2) unvirtuous endorsers who\npost probabilities that do not so cohere. A common way of explaining\nthe predictivist intuition is to note that accommodators tend to be\nviewed with a certain suspicion\u2014their endorsement of T\nbased on accommodated evidence may reflect a kind of social pressure\nto endorse T whatever its merits (cf. the \u2018fudging\nexplanation\u2019 above). Such an endorser may post a probability for\nT that is too high given her total evidence and background\nbelief\u2014predictivism thus becomes a strategy by which pluralist\nendorsers protect themselves from unvirtuous accommodators (Barnes\n2008: 61\u201369). \n\nBarnes then presents a theory of predictivism that is designed to\napply to virtuous endorsers. Virtuous predictivism has two roots: (1)\nthe prediction per se, which is constituted by an endorser\u2019s\nposting an endorsement level probability for T that entails\nempirical consequence N on a basis that does not include\nobservation-based evidence for T, and (2) predictive success,\nconstituted by the empirical demonstration that N is true. The\nprediction per se carries epistemic significance for a pluralist\nendorser because it implies that the predictor possesses reason\nR (consisting of background beliefs) that supports T. If\nthe endorser views the predictor as credible, this simple act of\nprediction carries epistemic weight. Predictive success then confirms\nthe truth of R, which thereby counts as evidence for T.\nNovel confirmation thus has the special virtue of confirming the\nbackground beliefs of the predictor\u2014accommodative confirmation\nlacks this virtue. \n\nBarnes presents two Bayesian thought experiments that purport to\nestablish virtuous predictivism. In each experiment an evaluator Eva\nfaces two scenarios\u2014one in which she confronts Peter who posts\nan endorsement probability for T without appeal to\nN-supporting observations (thus Peter predicts N) and\nanother in which she confronts Alex who posts an endorsement\nprobability for T on a basis that includes observations that\nestablish N (thus Alex accommodates N). The idea behind\nboth thought experiments is to make the scenarios otherwise as similar\nas possible\u2014Barnes makes a number of ceteris paribus\nassumption that render the probability functions of Peter and Alex\nmaximally similar. However it turns out that there is more than one\nway to keep the scenarios maximally similar: in the first experiment,\nPeter and Alex have the same likelihood ratio but have different\nposteriors for T. In the second scenario they have the same\nposteriors but different likelihood ratios. Barnes demonstrates that\nEva\u2019s posterior probability is higher in the predictor scenario\nin both experiments\u2014thus vindicating virtuous predictivism\n(2008: 69\u201380).\n\nAlthough his defense of virtuous predictivism is the centerpiece of\nhis account, Barnes claims that predictivism can hold true of actual\ntheory evaluation in a variety of ways. He maintains that the position\ndeemed \u2018weak predictivism\u2019 is actually ambiguous\u2014it\ncould refer to the claim that scientists actually rely on knowledge\nthat evidence was (or was not) predicted because prediction is\nsymptomatic of a some other feature(s) of theories that is\nepistemically important (\u2018tempered\n predictivism\u2019[13])\n or simply to the fact that there is a correlation between prediction\nand this other feature(s) (\u2018thin predictivism\u2019). The\ndistinction between tempered and thin predictivism cross classifies\nwith the distinction between virtuous and unvirtuous predictivism to\nproduce four varieties of weak predictivism. Barnes then turns to the\ncase of Mendeleev\u2019s periodic law and argues that all four\nvarieties can be distinguished in the scientific community\u2019s\nreaction to Mendeleev\u2019s theory of the elements (2008:\n82\u2013122). In particular, he argues that it was specifically\nMendeleev\u2019s predicted evidence, not his accommodated evidence,\nthat had the power to confirm his scientific and methodological\nbackground beliefs from the standpoint of the scientific community.\n\n\nCritical responses to Barnes\u2019s account are presented in Glymour\n2008; Leplin 2009; and Harker 2011. Barnes 2014 responds to these. See\nalso Magnus 2011 and Alai 2016.\n",
