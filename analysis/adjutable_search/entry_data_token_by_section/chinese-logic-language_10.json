    "main_text": "Xunzi\u2019s Confucian Appropriation of Mohist Logic\n6. Concluding Remarks\n\nAmong Chinese philosophical schools of the pre-Han era, it is the\nlater Mohists who deserve the greatest credit for pioneering and\nsystematizing the studies of language and logic. In the context of a\ngeneral theoretical framework based on precisely formulated\ndefinitions, they developed a workable theory of analogical inference\nthat was sensitive to the idiosyncratic semantic contributions of\nterms in combination. Awareness of the limitations of compositionality\nprobably led them away from the development of a theory of logical\nforms, but it stimulated insights about intensional phenomena in\nlanguage that prompted more sophisticated defenses of their ethical\nviews, and encouraged a broad understanding of how language functions\nin communicative discourse that warrants ongoing consideration today.\nXunzi may have reached a new height in the rigor and clarity with\nwhich he presented his logical and linguistic views, but he did not\nsurpass his Mohist forebears in originality, seeking primarily to\nutilize their insights in support of a largely Confucian ethical\nagenda. While the Mohists were clearly aware of many of the\nlimitations of their own methods of reasoning, they nevertheless\nretained the hope that a sophisticated analysis of language would\nreveal real similarities and differences in experience that would\nreliably guide ethical action. It is this general hope that was the\nfocus of Daoist critics like Zhuangzi, who argued from radically\nperspectivalist assumptions that no language, however refined, is\nadequate to the task of providing consistent normative standards.\nWhether or not this claim is true is still a matter of debate, with\nscholars of Chinese philosophy today leaning one way or another on\nancient conceptions of the roles of language and logic in human\nthought and action.\n",
