    "main_text": "The Epistemology of Computer Simulations || EOCS and the epistemology of experiment\n4.2 EOCS and the epistemology of experiment\n\n\nSome of the work on the EOCS has developed analogies between\ncomputer simulation in order to draw on recent work in the epistemology\nof experiment, particularly the work of Allan Franklin;\nsee the entry on \n experiments in physics.\n\n\nIn his work on the epistemology of experiment, Franklin (1986,\n1989) identified a number of strategies that experimenters use to\nincrease rational confidence in their results. Weissart (1997) \nand Parker (2008a) argued for various forms of analogy between these\nstrategies and a number of strategies available to simulationists to\nsanction their results. The most detailed analysis of these\nrelationships is to be found in Parker 2008a, where she also uses\nthese analogies to highlight weaknesses in current approaches to\nsimulation model evaluation.\n\n\nWinsberg (2003) also makes use of Ian Hacking\u2019s (1983, 1988,\n1992) work on the philosophy of experiment. One of Hacking\u2019s\ncentral insights about experiment is captured in his slogan that\nexperiments have a life of their own\u2019 (1992: 306). Hacking\nintended to convey two things with this slogan. The first was a\nreaction against the unstable picture of science that comes, for\nexample, from Kuhn. Hacking (1992) suggests that experimental results\ncan remain stable even in the face of dramatic changes in the other\nparts of sciences. The second, related, point he intended to\nconvey was that \u2018experiments are organic, develop, change, and\nyet retain a certain long-term development which makes us talk about\nrepeating and replicating experiments\u2019 (1992: 307). Some of the\ntechniques that simulationists use to construct their models get\ncredentialed in much the same way that Hacking says that instruments\nand experimental procedures and methods do; the credentials develop\nover an extended period of time and become deeply tradition-bound. In\nHacking\u2019s language, the techniques and sets of assumptions that\nsimulationists use become \u2018self-vindicating\u2019. Perhaps a\nbetter expression would be that they carry their own credentials. This\nprovides a response to the problem posed in 4.1, of understanding how\nsimulation could have a viable epistemology despite the motley and\nautonomous nature of its inferences.\n\n\nDrawing inspiration from another philosopher of experiment (Mayo\n1996), Parker (2008b) suggests a remedy to some of the shortcomings in\ncurrent approaches to simulation model evaluation. In this work,\nParker suggests that Mayo\u2019s error-statistical approach for\nunderstanding the traditional experiment\u2014which makes use of the\nnotion of a \u201csevere test\u201d\u2014could shed light on the\nepistemology of simulation. The central question of the epistemology\nof simulation from an error-statistical perspective becomes,\n\u2018What warrants our taking a computer simulation to be a severe\ntest of some hypothesis about the natural world? That is, what\nwarrants our concluding that the simulation would be unlikely to give\nthe results that it in fact gave, if the hypothesis of interest were\nfalse (2008b, 380)?  Parker believes that too much of what passes for\nsimulation model evaluation lacks rigor and structure because it:\n\n\nconsists in little more than side-by-side comparisons of simulation\noutput and observational data, with little or no explicit argumentation\nconcerning what, if anything, these comparisons indicate about the\ncapacity of the model to provide evidence for specific scientific\nhypotheses of interest. (2008b, 381)\n\n\nDrawing explicitly upon Mayo\u2019s (1996) work, she argues that\nwhat the epistemology of simulation ought to be doing, instead, is\noffering some account of the \u2018canonical errors\u2019 that can\narise, as well as strategies for probing for their presence.\n",
