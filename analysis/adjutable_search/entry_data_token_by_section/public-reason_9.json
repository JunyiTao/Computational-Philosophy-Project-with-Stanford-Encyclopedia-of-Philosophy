Structure\n\nIn order for some proposed principle or rule, X, to meet the\ntest of public reason, do the reasons or arguments that justify\nX need to be shared by all members of the constituency of\njustification, or can X meet the test of public reason by\nbeing justified to different people by appeal to different arguments?\nThis is a question about the structure of public reason, in\nparticular, about whether that structure must involve a kind of\nconsensus, or whether it can allow different people to converge on the\nsame rule or principle for entirely different reasons\n(D\u2019Agostino 1996, 30\u201331; Nagel 1987, 218\u2013219).\n\nOne possible view would require strong consensus in order for\nX to meet the test of public reason. On this account, each\nmember of the constituency of public reason would have to be justified\nin accepting X for the very same reason or set of reasons. If\nmembers of the constituency do not share the same justification for\nX, then X would not pass the test of public reason.\nHabermas might be endorsing the strong consensus view when he says\n\u201cthe consensus brought about through argument must rest on\nidentical reasons able to convince the parties in the same\nway\u201d (Habermas 1996, 339).\n\nA second view requires only weak consensus. On this view, it\nis not necessary that each person shares the very same justification\nfor accepting X, but it is necessary that each person\u2019s\njustification for accepting X should depend only on\nshared or public reasons, that is, reasons that all other\nmembers of the justificatory constituency could accept as valid\nconsiderations that provide a plausible basis for accepting\nX, even if there is disagreement among the members as to\nwhich set of shared reasons in fact provides the appropriate\njustification for endorsing X. To illustrate, Albert might\nbelieve X is justified because it follows from a commitment\nto equality of opportunity, whereas Betty might believe X is\njustified because it is a necessary means of protecting\nindividuals\u2019 rights to freedom of religion, but so long as both\nthese considerations\u2014equality of opportunity and the right to\nfreedom of religion\u2014are accepted as valid normative\nconsiderations by all members of the constituency and provide a\nplausible or reasonable basis of support for X, then\nX can meet the test of public reason despite the fact that\ndifferent members believe X to be justified for different\nreasons. The weak consensus view of public reason\u2019s structure\nseems to reflect Rawls\u2019s position, and has been explicitly\ndefended by others (Macedo 2010 (Other Internet Resources); Quong\n2011, 261\u2013273; Watson and Hartley 2018, 40\u201361).\n\nIt may be helpful to connect this view regarding the structure of\npublic reason to Rawls\u2019s discussion of the related concepts of\npublic justification and the idea of an overlapping\nconsensus. For Rawls, public justification is achieved\n\u201cwhen all the reasonable members of political society carry out\na justification of the shared political conception by embedding it in\ntheir several reasonable comprehensive views\u201d (Rawls 1996, 387).\nWhen each reasonable person has found a sufficient comprehensive or\nnon-shared justification of a political liberal conception of justice,\nthen we can say that an overlapping consensus on a political\nconception of justice exists, and as a result of this consensus, there\nis a public justification of our shared political conception of\njustice. But Rawls is clear that \u201cwhile the public justification\nof the political conception\u2026depends on reasonable comprehensive\ndoctrines, it does so only in an indirect way. That is, the express\ncontents of the doctrines have no normative role in public\njustification; citizens do not look into the content of others\u2019\ndoctrines\u2026Rather, they take into account and give some weight\nonly to the fact\u2014to the existence\u2014of the reasonable\noverlapping consensus itself\u201d (Rawls 1996, 387). For Rawls,\npublic justification thus depends on the fact that all reasonable\npersons can endorse a political conception of justice from within\ntheir non-public or comprehensive doctrines, but public reason itself\nmakes no reference to the content of those nonpublic\ndoctrines\u2014it depends only on the shared political ideas found\nwithin the political conception of justice.\n\nBy contrast, convergence accounts of public reason\u2019s\nstructure allow for the possibility that a principle or rule may meet\nthe test of public reason even in the absence of any shared or public\nreasons (Billingham 2016; Billingham 2017; Gaus 2009; Gaus 2011,\n276\u2013292; Gaus and Vallier 2009, Stout 2004, 72\u201373; Vallier\n2014; Vallier 2016). Here is an illustration of the convergence view.\nX is justified for Albert by appeal to reason Ra, but this\nreason is drawn from Albert\u2019s religious doctrine. Ra is, we can\ntemporarily assume, only normative for Albert and others who adhere to\nthis religious doctrine. For Betty, on the other hand, X can\nbe justified by appeal to Rb, a reason drawn from her different\nreligious doctrine. Suppose Albert and Betty are the only members of\nthe justificatory constituency and suppose there are no shared reasons\nthat would justify accepting X. Under these conditions, the\nconvergence account holds that X meets the test of public\nreason because Albert and Betty each have a sufficient justification\nfor X, even though the reasons supporting their convergent\njustifications are not shared. Note that proponents of the convergence\nview need not (and typically do not) deny that shared justifications\nof the sort described in the preceding paragraphs are also a\nsuccessful way for a proposed rule to meet the test of public\nreason\u2014they simply insist, contra proponents of consensus views,\nthat convergent justifications are also an acceptable structure for\npublic reason.\n\nThe convergence view appears to depend on the assumption that\njustifications and reasons can be relative to particular persons, that\nis, what constitutes a justification for Albert may not succeed as a\njustification for Betty, and vice versa. But some have argued that\nthis means the convergence view depends on a controversial\nphilosophical position that is the subject of reasonable disagreement.\nUnless this controversial view is assumed, the convergence view cannot\nassure us that Albert and Betty can each sincerely believe that the\nother is justified in accepting X. The convergence view,\naccording to this critique, thus either depends on a reasonably\ndisputed philosophical thesis, or else it fails to show that all\nparties to a convergent justification are indeed justified in\nendorsing the rule in question (Quong 2011, 261\u2013273). Other\ncritics of the convergence view argue that it has unwelcome\ninstitutional implications regarding the interpretation and\napplication of laws, and that unlike consensus approaches, it fails to\nprovide citizens with the type of mutual assurance that others are\ncommitted to the project of public reasoning about fundamental\npolitical matters (Macedo 2010, Other Internet Resources; Watson and\nHartley 2018, 58\u201360). Others argue that the convergence account faces\na dilemma: it either runs the risk of self-defeat, or else it involves\na form of moral authoritarianism to which it purports to be opposed\n(Wall 2013).\n\nFor their part, proponents of the convergence view argue that what\nmatters for public reason is that rules or laws be justified to each\nindividual person to whom the rules or laws apply. If, as proponents\nof the convergence model insist, different people can be justified in\nendorsing the same rule for entirely different reasons, then\nproponents of public reason have no principled basis to oppose\nconvergent forms of justification. Defenders of the view also insist\nthat the requirement for consensus or shared reasons is overly\ndemanding, and fails to be consistent with the pluralistic forms of\nreasoning that are possible amongst the relevant members of the\nconstituency of public reason. Part of the point of public reason, on\nthis view, is to accommodate the diverse forms of reasoning that are\nbound to exist among any reasonably competent group of reasoners (Gaus\n2011, 288\u2013292; Vallier, 2014; Vallier, 2016).\n",
