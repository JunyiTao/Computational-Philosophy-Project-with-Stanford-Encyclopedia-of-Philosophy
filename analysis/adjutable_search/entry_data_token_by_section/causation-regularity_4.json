    "main_text": "Regularity Theories of Causation || Contemporary Regularity Theories\n1.4 Contemporary Regularity Theories\n\nMackie\u2019s theory of causation continues to be influential.\nRichard Wright (1985, 2011) proposed a similar account for identifying\ncauses which can be, and indeed is, used in legal contexts. Building\non Hart and Honor\u00e9 (1985), he defined a cause as follows: a\ncondition \\(c\\) was a cause of \\(e\\) iff \\(c\\) was necessary for the\ncausal sufficiency of a set of existing conditions that was jointly\nsufficient for the occurrence of \\(e\\). Causal sufficiency is here\ndifferent from lawful sufficiency: the set of conditions must\ninstantiate the antecedent of a causal law whose consequent is then\ninstantiated by the effect. Wright\u2019s account requires that we\nhave causal laws\u2014as opposed to laws\u2014at our disposal and so\nit is only reductive if we have a reduction of the causal laws.\nNevertheless, the idea that a cause is a necessary element of a\nsufficient set for an effect has been applied in legal cases to\ndetermine which event has caused another. In fact, this NESS test for\ncausation has itself become influential in legal theory (see the entry on\n causation in the law).\n\nStrevens (2007) develops Mackie\u2019s theory further. On the way, he\nlikewise gives up its reductive character by replacing sufficiency\nwith causal sufficiency. The latter is to be understood in terms of\ncausal entailment, which in turn is supposed to represent a causal\nprocess. (We explain Strevens\u2019s theory of causation in greater\ndetail in\n \u00a72.4.)\n Notably, Strevens (2007) argues that Mackie\u2019s original theory\nalready solves not only the causal scenario known as\noverdetermination\u2014as everyone agrees\u2014but also (early and\nlate) preemption. (For an overview of problematic causal scenarios,\nsee Paul & Hall 2013).\n\nBaumgartner (2008, 2013) developed Mackie\u2019s theory further while\nkeeping its reductive character. He observes that complex regularities\nlike \n\n\\[(C_1 \\land C_2) \\lor D_1 \\leftrightarrow E\\]\n\n\nare not symmetric in the following sense: an instantiation of a\ncluster is sufficient for \\(E\\), but an instantiation of \\(E\\) is\ngenerally not sufficient to determine which cluster is instantiated.\nAn instantiation of \\(E\\) does not determine whether \\(C_1 \\land C_2\\)\nor \\(D_1\\) is instantiated. An instantiation of \\(E\\) only determines\nthe whole disjunction of minimally sufficient clusters. This\nnon-symmetry may be exploited to establish a notion of causal priority\nor the direction of causation.\n\nThere is, of course, a problem when a single cluster is necessary and\nsufficient for an effect: \n\n\\[(C_1 \\land C_2) \\leftrightarrow E.\\]\n\n\nHere the instantiation of \\(E\\) is sufficient to determine the\ninstantiation of the cluster. Baumgartner\u2019s suggestion requires\nan effect to have at least two alternative sufficient clusters in\norder to establish the direction of causation. And even then, it seems\nthat the problem of joint effects of a common cause is still unsolved.\nConsider\n Figure 2,\n where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the joint effects of a common cause \\(C\\),\nand \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) are alternative causes for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\),\nrespectively.\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nWhenever \\(A \\land \\neg D\\) is actual, so is \\(C\\)\u2014for no effect\noccurs without any of its causes. Furthermore, whenever \\(C\\) occurs,\nso does \\(B\\). Hence, \\(A \\land \\neg D\\) is minimally sufficient for\n\\(C\\), and thus for \\(B\\). And \\(A \\land \\neg D\\) is a minimally\nsufficient cluster in a necessary condition for \\(B\\):\n\\[\\tag{1} (A \\land \\neg D) \\lor C \\lor E \\leftrightarrow B.\\]\n\nBut \\(A \\land \\neg D\\) should not count as a cause of \\(B\\). After\nall, the causes of \\(B\\) are only \\(C\\) and \\(E\\) in this causal\nscenario.\n\nBaumgartner proposes a solution. The complex regularity for an effect\nmust be necessary for that effect in a minimal way. \\(B\\) is\ninstantiated only if \\(C\\) or \\(E\\) is instantiated. Hence, \\(C \\lor\nE\\) is necessary for \\(B\\). And the left side of the complex\nregularity\n (1)\n contains no other disjunction\u2014obtained by removing one\ndisjunct\u2014which is necessary for \\(B\\). There are only two\ncandidates. \\((A \\land \\neg D) \\lor C\\) is not necessary because \\(B\\)\ncan be instantiated along with \\(E, \\neg C\\), and \\(A \\land D\\).\nSimilarly, \\((A \\land \\neg D) \\lor E\\) is not necessary because \\(B\\)\ncan be instantiated along with \\(C,\\) \\(\\neg E\\) and \\(A \\land D\\).\nHence, \\(B \\rightarrow C \\lor E\\) and no disjunct can be removed from\n\\(C \\lor E\\) such that the implication still holds. In this sense, \\(C\n\\lor E\\) is a minimally necessary disjunction of minimally\nsufficient clusters for \\(B\\).\n\nThe notion of a minimally necessary disjunction can also be\ncharacterized in terms of more formal concepts. Suppose \\(\\mathbf{C}\\)\nis a set of clusters, where each cluster is given by a conjunction of\nfactors. \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is a minimally necessary condition for \\(E\\)\niff\n\n(i)\n\\(\\bigvee \\mathbf{C} \\leftrightarrow E\\) is true in the actual\nworld, and\n(ii)\nthere is no \\(\\mathbf{C}'\\subset \\mathbf{C}\\) such that \\(\\bigvee\n\\mathbf{C}' \\leftrightarrow E\\) is also true in the actual world.\n\n\n(\\(\\bigvee \\mathbf{C}\\) designates some disjunction of the members of\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\).)\n\nThe underlying reason why \\(A \\land \\neg D\\) can be pruned from the\nleft side of\n (1)\n is that \\(A \\land \\neg D\\) is sufficient for \\(C \\lor E\\), while the\nlatter is not sufficient for the former in the given scenario. Now, an\ninstantiation of \\(C \\lor E\\) makes a difference as to whether or not\n\\(B\\) is instantiated\u2014independently of \\(A \\land \\neg D\\). The\nconverse is not true: an instantiation of \\(A \\land \\neg D\\) makes a\ndifference as to whether or not \\(B\\) is instantiated, but not\nindependently of \\(C \\lor E\\) (see Baumgartner 2008: 340\u2013346 and\n2013: 90\u201396). This suggests the following requirement: a complex\nregularity for an effect must be a minimally necessary disjunction of\nminimally sufficient clusters for said effect. Indeed, given that each\neffect has at least two alternative causes, this seems to solve the\nproblem of joint effects of a common cause.\n\nBaumgartner (2013: 95) defines a cause on the type level as follows.\nRelative to a factor set containing \\(C\\) and \\(E\\), \\(C\\) is a\ntype-level cause of \\(E\\) iff\n\n(i)\n\\(C\\) is a factor of a minimally necessary disjunction of\nminimally sufficient clusters for \\(E\\), and\n(ii)\n\\(C\\) remains such a factor for any suitable expansion of the\nfactor set.\n\n\nA type-level cause is thus permanently non-redundant for its effect.\nHe then goes on to define a cause on the token level (for details, see\nBaumgartner 2013: 98). Relative to a factor set containing \\(C\\) and\n\\(E\\), an instance \\(c\\) of \\(C\\) is an actual cause of an instance\n\\(e\\) of \\(E\\) iff \\(C\\) is a type-level cause of \\(E\\), and, for all\nsuitable expansions of the factor set including the original factor\nset, \\(C\\) is on an active causal route to \\(E\\). An active causal\nroute is roughly a sequence of factors \\(\\langle Z_1, \\ldots , Z_n\n\\rangle\\), where each element \\(Z_i\\) is a factor of a minimally\nnecessary disjunction of minimally sufficient clusters for its\nsuccessor element \\(Z_{i+1}\\), and each \\(Z_i\\) is co-instantiated\nwith a set of factors \\(X_i\\) such that \\(Z_i \\land X_i\\) form a\nminimally sufficient cluster for \\(Z_{i+1}\\). This amounts to a quite\npowerful analysis of actual causation. It solves many scenarios which\nare troublesome for counterfactual accounts, including\noverdetermination, early and late preemption, and scenarios known as\n\u201cswitches\u201c, and \u201cshort-circuits\u201c. For a\ndetailed study of these scenarios and an explanation why they are\ntrouble for the counterfactual approach to causation, see Paul and\nHall (2013). Finally, it should be noted that Baumgartner\u2019s\nregularity theory faces a problem relating to what Baumgartner and\nFalk (forthcoming) call structural redundancies. The latter explain\nthis problem and offer a solution based on a causal uniqueness\nassumption.\n",
