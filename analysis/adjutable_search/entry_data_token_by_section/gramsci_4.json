In January 1927 he\nwas conveyed to Milan, where he was placed in isolation and underwent\ninterrogation. Permitted to receive books and write two letters a\nweek, Gramsci indicated some potential writing projects in\ncorrespondence to his sister-in-law, Tatiana Schucht, who remained in\nItaly during his imprisonment and became a vital source of support. He\nsuggested that he would like to write something \u201cfrom a\n\u2018disinterested\u2019 standpoint, f\u00fcr ewig\u201d\n(\u201cfor eternity\u201d, borrowing a phrase from Goethe) (GPL:\n45). He was visited by his Turin friend, Piero Sraffa (later a\nwell-known Cambridge University economist), who helped supply reading\nmaterials and acted as an interlocutor with Togliatti.\n\nEventually, in May 1928, a special tribunal was held in Rome. Gramsci\nwas sentenced to 20 years, 4 months and 5 days in prison (but in 1932\nthe sentence was commuted to 12 years). The prosecutor had remarked\n\u201cWe must stop this brain from functioning for twenty\nyears\u201d (PPW: xxviii). Already in fragile health, he was\ntransferred to the prison in Turi di Bari, in the region of Apulia.\nLater\u2014and despite the prosecutor\u2014he was granted a cell of\nhis own and permission to read and write. The first of his\nNotebooks is dated 8 February 1929.\n\nLife in prison was not easy. Gramsci\u2019s health continued to\ndeteriorate\u2014he was badly neglected by the prison\nauthorities\u2014and he suffered psychologically from his isolation.\nYet was he not entirely cut off from events outside. He received\nvisits from Tatiana and from his brothers, who (in addition to\nservicing his study needs and advocating on his behalf for medical\ntreatment) passed on news concerning the PCd\u2019I and the Russian\nleadership. So, at least initially, he was not wholly unaware of\nchanging policies and strategic decisions. The Comintern\u2019s\nswitch in policy from 1928\u2014the so-called \u201cThird\nPeriod\u201d: abandoning the united front tactic in favor of class\ninsurrection, on the assumption that a crisis in capitalism was\nimminent, denouncing potential socialist and social democratic parties\nas \u201csocial fascists\u201d\u2014contrasted with Gramsci\u2019s\nposition supporting alliances. Gramsci\u2019s criticism of this new\npolicy brought ostracism from other communist prisoners (Spriano 1977\n[1979: 70\u20131]).\n\nGramsci\u2019s correspondence (like his Notebooks) was read\nby the prison authorities and subject to censorship, meaning that\npolitical references to outside events had to be muted or entirely\nabsent. Nonetheless, he kept in regular contact with his wife and\nchildren (one of whom he had never met), and his mother. His letters\noffer fascinating insight into his intellectual interests, personal\nfeelings, and health during incarceration (see GPL). He wrote stories\nfor his young sons and reminisced about his own childhood in Sardinia.\nInitially, with other party members in the prison, he took part in\nreading groups and political conversations. However, his declining\nhealth over the years encouraged supporters to request his release or\ntransfer to an infirmary. Gramsci refused to agree to his own\nconditional release if that meant renouncing all political\nactivity.\n\nIn 1933 he was finally moved to a clinic in Formia. He continued to\nwrite but less productively and, after 1935, mostly correspondence. At\nFormia he eventually applied for and was granted conditional freedom\n(which enabled him to leave the grounds in the company of Tatiana). In\nAugust 1935 he moved to the \u201cQuisisana\u201d sanatorium in Rome\nwhere he received visits from Sraffa and from his brothers, and where\nin April 1937 his sentence finally expired. By that time, he was\ngravely ill. On the evening of 25 April 1937, Gramsci suffered a\ncerebral hemorrhage. He died in the early hours of 27 April.\n\nGramsci\u2019s funeral was held the next day and his ashes were kept\nlocally until after the war, when they were moved to the English\nCemetery in Rome, where his grave remains. Tatiana retrieved\nGramsci\u2019s thirty-three handwritten Notebooks; these\nwere secured secretly in a bank until the following year when they\nwere smuggled to Moscow and passed on to the PCd\u2019I (Spriano 1977\n[1979: 133\u201334]).\n",
