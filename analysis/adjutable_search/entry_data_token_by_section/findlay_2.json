Values and Intentions (1936\u201363)\n\nAfter completing the book on Meinong in 1932, Findlay began work on\nValues and Intentions (VI), a project that occupied him, on\nand off, for the next thirty years. The resulting book combines the\nphenomenological tradition of Brentano with the analytical psychology\nof G. F. Stout and the empirical discoveries of the W\u00fcrzburg\npsychologists. It also attempts to integrate the philosophy of mind\nand moral philosophy. Its predecessor, and perhaps its organizational\nmodel, is Hume\u2019s Treatise (1738), which also begins\nwith perceptions, proceeds to emotions, and then moves on to\nconclusions about ethics. But it rejects Hume\u2019s phenomenalism,\nand attempts a smoother dialectical flow from the laws of the mind to\nthe rules of justice.\n\nOn a typical page of Values and Intentions, one finds little\nargument but much description. These descriptions of mental processes\nare presented as the results of introspection. Now, even by 1932,\nintrospection was rejected as a method in both philosophy and\npsychology. This dismissive attitude was recognized, weighed, and\nrejected by Findlay in his article \u201cRecommendations Concerning\nthe Language of Introspection\u201d (1948b). The reader, on first\nencountering Values and Intentions, may stand with\nWittgenstein and declare, \u201cBy God, this is impossible\u201d. Or\nshe may be persuaded by Findlay that it can be done because he does\nit. From Findlay\u2019s viewpoint, Wittgenstein portrays our inner\nlife as a desert. For him, it is a rainforest.\n\nFindlay follows Brentano in vigorously maintaining that intentionality\nis the mark of the mental. But then the exposition turns Husserlian.\nIntentional objects are presented to consciousness, but they can\npresent themselves clearly or obscurely, completely or incompletely,\nin various lights and with varying scope. There is a problem\ndistinguishing what is in consciousness from what lies outside it.\n\u201cWe must distinguish, between what is actually and what is only\nfacultatively or dispositionally present to mind\u201d. The\ndistinction provides an occasion for a typical descriptive\nexcursus:\n\n\nThe interior of a church may be ready to come to mind when I\nlook steadily at its fa\u00e7ade, but this is not the same as the\nactual presence to my mind of [the fa\u00e7ade\u2019s] contrasting\npattern of black and white layers, which I nevertheless do not\nexplicitly \u2018notice\u2019\u2026. In thinking of Jeremiah I\nmay, e.g., think definitively, though obscurely, of Hebrew prophets\nand prophecy: I may, however, only be ready to think of the\nprophet Amos or of the prophetess Joanna Southcott. (VI: 48)\n\n\n\n\nThe rule is that for every thought, there is an object of thought.\nPrior and many other have objected to this: Prior\u2019s\ncounterexample is \u201cI am thinking of nothing\u201d (Prior 1971:\n122\u2013123). But these counterexamples only work if the sentences\nthat express them are true. One wonders if one can think of nothing,\nor whether what is referred to in \u201cthinking of nothing\u201d,\nis, as older people often experience, an unnoticed bout of\nunconsciousness.\n\nA deeper problem for Findlay and the \u201cmind as\nintentionality\u201d school is the presence of phenomena that seem to\nbe mental but are not intentional, like the pains and quales that\npreoccupy discussions in the contemporary philosophy of mind. Here\nFindlay reverts, surprisingly, to his \u201cdepressed\nmaterialism\u201d and identifies such states with bodily\nconditions:\n\n\nThat the category of indiscerptible, qualitative feeling has no plain\ninstances has been recognized by thinkers, who, like Titchener, reduce\nthe life of feeling to two strange \u201cfeeling elements\u201d of\npleasure or unpleasure, or who like Ryle, operate with various\ntwinges, tingles, throbs, and other residua of emotional\nexperience\u2026. These doctrines are a mistake, only abstracts torn\nfrom sensible objects have such qualitative status, the whole placing\nof them \u2018in the mind\u2019 points to a confusion and\nmisapplication of categories.\u2026\n\n\u2026here their links with our conscious orientations seem\ncontingent rather than necessary: it is for instance unclear\nwhy sensory pains should be so very disagreeable, so much an\nobject of aversion.\u2026 our hatred of pain is not per se\nintelligible, but can at best achieve a quasi-intelligibility when\nseen in the more general quasi-intelligibility of \u2018bodily\npurpose.\u2019 \n\nThe main emergent use of \u2018feeling\u2019 in connection with our\nown bodies, is therefore that of the largely obscure\u2026knowledge\nof our bodily state; it is the intimation of the body itself gives us\nof our inner condition. (VI: 172\u20133)\n\n\nIt is possible, then, to have a pain and yet not be repelled by it, a\nview confirmed by modern medical research on pain agnosia.\n\nIt is not possible here to unravel all the details of Findlay\u2019s\ntreatment of beliefs, wishes, wants, and acts of will. Each token case\nof a propositional attitude can manifest itself as a concentrated\n\u201csense\u201d before the mind, or spread itself out as a pattern\nof behavior in the physical sphere. The account is complicated,\nperhaps too complicated for anyone to have accepted it. But we must\nremark on the distinction between believing and wishing, as this\npoints towards the ethics section of the book. When we believe that\nsomething is so, we cannot wish that it is so. We can only wish that\nit be not so. Conversely, when we believe that something is not so, we\ncannot wish that it be not so, but we can wish that it be so. Wishes,\nthen, are directed at making the non-existent exist or the existing\nnot exist. (or, in a parallel way, towards the making true or the\nmaking false of propositions.) This is the starting point of ethics.\nWe wish the world changed in some\n way.[6]\n\nIf ethics starts with wishes, then the ethical system that emerges\nwill be broadly teleological: the good is prior to the right, as the\ngood is what we wish for. But the good cannot be a one dimensional\ngood, nor can the many dimensions of good be compared with each other,\nnor is it intelligible to speak of \u201cmaximizing the good\u201d.\nSo the system that results is a form of ideal utilitarianism of the\nsort desiderated by Hastings Rashdall (1907) and described in the last\nchapter of Moore\u2019s Principia Ethica (1903: ch. 6). It\nis hostile to rule based ethical systems deriving from the Decalogue\nor Kant, and hostile to puritanism while suspicious of hedonism.\nFindlay\u2019s principles of axiology, culled and combined from the\nworks of Brentano, Meinong, Scheler, and Hartmann, as well as Moore,\nRashdall, and Ross, include:\n\n\n\u2026.that there are radically different sorts or senses of value\nbetween which quantitative or even ordinal comparison is not readily\npossible, that there is a deep distinction between values that appear\npurely personal and those that claim cogency or validity, that value\nand values have a close and necessary relation to feeling, but that\nvalues that claim cogency or validity cannot be exhaustively analyzed\nor even explained in terms of mere feeling, that the main\n\u2018heads\u2019 of impersonal valuation, freedom, fairness,\nhappiness etc, are moderately clearly and readily agreed upon though\ntheir detailed specification or correct practical implementation is\ninfinitely controversial, that value and disvalue have close\nconnections with various senses of \u201cought\u201d but that the\ncentral sense of the latter reveal it as a much more restricted\nconception, much more closely concerned with disvalues and their\navoidance than with values\u2026 that the values called\n\u201cmoral\u201d presuppose all other types of value as objects of\npursuit, but their value does not depend on the latter value, that\nmoral value has a close connection with the readiness to sacrifice\npersonal good for impersonal good, etc. (AE: 78)\n\n\nPerhaps the most unusual claim of Values and Intentions is\nthat there is a dialectical connection between personal values and\nimpersonal values. Adam Smith had described the shift from the partial\nspectator to the impartial spectator, and contemporary authors remark\nfrequently on the transition from the first person standpoint to the\nthird (or second) person standpoint. In these authors, however, the\ntransition is contingent, based either on a free choice, or on moral\neducation, or on Aristotelian conditioning. In Findlay, the transition\nis based on a drive for generality that is inherent in the operations\nof the mind:\n\n\nIt is natural, and nigh inevitable, for a man reflecting more or less\ndisengagedly on the objects of his various parcelled interests to\nacquire a second-order zest for the interesting as such and for any\nand every interest.(TC: 70)...impersonality is by\nits nature contagious. It obeys a \u2018logic\u2019 and that logic is to spread, to level farther and farther, to become more and more\nabsolute. Once speak for some, and one will find oneself\nreadily forced into speaking for more, until, in all situations not\nwarped by personal bias, one comes to speak for all: impersonality\nresembles the scriptural mustard-seed in whose branches the fowls of\nthe air ultimately find their accommodation. (VI 430)\n\n\nFindlay in many places develops this \u201cdrive for\ngenerality\u201d. To begin, there are certain basic values that\naccompany all good thinking, such as clarity, consistency, and\nsimplicity. These are essential to communication; they are\n\u201cvalues in speaking\u201d (1950b [LMV 105\u2013128]), and must\nbe deployed even by nihilists who profess contempt for logic.\nSecondly, there are the virtues of good scientific thinking, including\navoidance of arbitrary Duhemian maneuvers and manufactured concepts\nlike Goodman\u2019s \u201cgrue\u201d and\n \u201cbleen\u201d.[7]\n Thirdly, there are the virtues of good practical reasoning, including\nrational arbitration between the demands of present versus future\nselves. Like Sidgwick before him and T. Nagel after, Findlay argues\nthat the admitting the demands of my future self but a step towards\nadmitting the demands of other selves:\n\n\nThe rise to self-love is in fact a matter so strange that the further\nspread to rational benevolence is trivial by comparison: having come\nto be interested in, e.g., the provision of food at a time when I am\nnot hungry, it is no great wonder that I am rationally moved by\nanother\u2019s real or imagined need for food as much as by my\nown.\u2026 And by, an extension natural to it, once its ampliative\nzeal has got underway, it tends to extend itself to an interest in\nwhat is interesting to anyone or everyone, and to develop a defensive\ndislike of whatever sets grounds to its natural expansiveness. (TC:\n71) \n\n\nThe drive to generality moves us from favoring personal good to\nimpersonal goods. Rules about the right, or the \u201cmoral\nought\u201d concern the production, distribution, or destruction of\nimpersonal goods. Oddly, justice in impersonal goods requires the\nrecognition of persons, subjective selves. These are introduced in\nValues and Intentions via discussions of the problem of other\nminds, which for Findlay is no pseudo-problem. The solution is found\nby applying the ubiquitous phenomenological relation of \u201cseeing\nas\u201d to social interactions. The argument involves the idea that\nmental states are psycho-physical complexes with poignant concentrated\nfeelings on one side and spread out behavior on the other. We perceive\nsome patterns of behavior as intentional, some as mechanical. When we\nperceive the behavior as intentional, we infer the psychical side.\n(Findlay\u2019s discussion of reactive perceptions anticipates by\nseveral years Peter Strawson\u2019s work on reactive attitudes.) The\nbottom line, however, is familiar: justice requires placing oneself in\nthe shoes of the other.\n",
