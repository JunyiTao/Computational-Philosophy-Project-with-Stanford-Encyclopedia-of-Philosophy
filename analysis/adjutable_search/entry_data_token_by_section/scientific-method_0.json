Overview and organizing themes\n\nThis entry could have been given the title Scientific Methods and gone\non to fill volumes, or it could have been extremely short, consisting\nof a brief summary rejection of the idea that there is any such thing\nas a unique Scientific Method at all. Both unhappy prospects are due\nto the fact that scientific activity varies so much across\ndisciplines, times, places, and scientists that any account which\nmanages to unify it all will either consist of overwhelming\ndescriptive detail, or trivial generalizations.\n\nThe choice of scope for the present entry is more optimistic, taking a\ncue from the recent movement in philosophy of science toward a greater\nattention to practice: to what scientists actually do. This\n\u201cturn to practice\u201d can be seen as the latest form of\nstudies of methods in science, insofar as it represents an attempt at\nunderstanding scientific activity, but through accounts that are\nneither meant to be universal and unified, nor singular and narrowly\ndescriptive. To some extent, different scientists at different times\nand places can be said to be using the same method even though, in\npractice, the details are different.\n\nWhether the context in which methods are carried out is relevant, or\nto what extent, will depend largely on what one takes the aims of\nscience to be and what one\u2019s own aims are. For most of the\nhistory of scientific methodology the assumption has been that the\nmost important output of science is knowledge and so the aim of\nmethodology should be to discover those methods by which scientific\nknowledge is generated.\n\nScience was seen to embody the most successful form of reasoning (but\nwhich form?) to the most certain knowledge claims (but how certain?)\non the basis of systematically collected evidence (but what counts as\nevidence, and should the evidence of the senses take precedence, or\nrational insight?)\n Section 2\n surveys some of the history, pointing to two major themes. One theme\nis seeking the right balance between observation and reasoning (and\nthe attendant forms of reasoning which employ them); the other is how\ncertain scientific knowledge is or can be.\n\nSection 3\n turns to 20th century debates on scientific method. In the\nsecond half of the 20th century the epistemic privilege of\nscience faced several challenges and many philosophers of science\nabandoned the reconstruction of the logic of scientific method. Views\nchanged significantly regarding which functions of science ought to be\ncaptured and why. For some, the success of science was better\nidentified with social or cultural features. Historical and\nsociological turns in the philosophy of science were made, with a\ndemand that greater attention be paid to the non-epistemic aspects of\nscience, such as sociological, institutional, material, and political\nfactors. Even outside of those movements there was an increased\nspecialization in the philosophy of science, with more and more focus\non specific fields within science. The combined upshot was very few\nphilosophers arguing any longer for a grand unified methodology of\nscience. Sections 3 and 4 surveys the main positions on scientific\nmethod in 20th century philosophy of science, focusing on\nwhere they differ in their preference for confirmation or\nfalsification or for waiving the idea of a special scientific method\naltogether.\n\nIn recent decades, attention has primarily been paid to scientific\nactivities traditionally falling under the rubric of method, such as\nexperimental design and general laboratory practice, the use of\nstatistics, the construction and use of models and diagrams,\ninterdisciplinary collaboration, and science communication. Sections\n4\u20136 attempt to construct a map of the current domains of the\nstudy of methods in science.\n\nAs these sections illustrate, the question of method is still central\nto the discourse about science. Scientific method remains a topic for\neducation, for science policy, and for scientists. It arises in the\npublic domain where the demarcation or status of science is at issue.\nSome philosophers have recently returned, therefore, to the question\nof what it is that makes science a unique cultural product. This entry\nwill close with some of these recent attempts at discerning and\nencapsulating the activities by which scientific knowledge is\nachieved.\n",
