Moore\u2019s proof can be reconstructed\nas follows:\n\nMoore\n\n\\(\\rE_8\\).\n My experience is in all respects as of a hand held up in front of\nmy face.\n\\(\\rP_8\\).\n Here is a hand.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_8\\).\n There is a material world (since any hand is a material object\nexisting in space).\n\n\n\nEvidence\n \\(\\rE_8\\)\n in Moore is constituted by a proposition believed\nby \\(s\\). One might suggest, however, that this is a misinterpretation\nof Moore\u2019s proof (and variants of it that we shall consider\nshortly). One might argue that what is meant to give \\(s\\)\njustification for believing\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n is \\(s\\)\u2019s experience of a hand. Nevertheless, most of\nthe epistemologists participating in this debate implicitly or\nexplicitly assume that one\u2019s experience as if \\(p\\) and\none\u2019s belief that one has an experience as if \\(p\\) have the\nsame justifying power (cf. White 2006 and Silins 2007).\n\nMany philosophers find Moore\u2019s proof unsuccessful. Philosophers\nhave proposed explanations of this impression according to which\nMoore is non-transmissive in some of the senses described in\n Sect. 3\n (see mainly Wright 1985, 2002, 2007 and\n 2011).[11]\n A different explanation is that Moore\u2019s proof does\ntransmit justification but is dialectically ineffective (see mainly\nPryor 2004).\n\nAccording to Wright, there exist cornerstone propositions (or\nsimply cornerstones), where \\(c\\) is a cornerstone for an\narea of discourse \\(d\\) just in case for any proposition \\(p\\)\nbelonging to \\(d, p\\) could not be justified for any subject \\(s\\) if\n\\(s\\) had no independent justification for accepting \\(c\\) (see mainly\nWright\n 2004).[12]\n Cornerstones for the area of discourse about perceivable things are\nfor instance the logical negations of skeptical conjectures,\nsuch as the proposition that one\u2019s experiences are nothing but\none\u2019s hallucinations caused by a Cartesian demon or the Matrix.\nWright contends that the conclusion\n \\(\\rQ_8\\)\n of Moore is also a cornerstone for the area of discourse\nabout perceivable things. Adapting terminology introduced by Pryor\n(2004), Wright\u2019s conception of the architecture of perceptual\njustification thus treats \\(\\rQ_8\\) conservatively with\nrespect to any perceptual hypothesis \\(p\\): if \\(s\\) had no\nindependent justification for \\(\\rQ_8\\), no proposition \\(e\\)\ndescribing an apparent perception could supply \\(s\\) with prima\nfacie justification for any perceptual hypothesis \\(p\\). It\nfollows from this that Moore instantiates the\ninformation-dependence template considered in\n Sect. 3.2.\n For \\(\\rQ_8\\) is part of the collateral information which \\(s\\) needs\nindependent justification for if \\(s\\) is to receive some\njustification for\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n from\n \\(\\rE_8\\).\n Hence Moore is non-transmissive (see mainly Wright 2002).\nNote that the thesis that Moore\u2019s proof is epistemologically\nuseless because non-transmissive in this sense is compatible with the\nclaim that by learning \\(\\rE_8, s\\) does acquire a justification for\nbelieving \\(\\rP_8\\). For instance, Wright (2004) contends that we all\nhave a special kind of non-evidential justification, which he\ncalls entitlement, for accepting \\(\\rQ_8\\) as well as other\ncornerstones in\n general.[13]\n So, by learning \\(\\rE_8\\) we do acquire justification for \\(\\rP_8\\).\nWright\u2019s analysis of Moore\u2019s proof and Wright\u2019s\nconservatism have mostly been criticized in conjunction with his\ntheory of entitlement. A presentation of these objections is beyond\nthe scope of this entry. (See however Davies 2004; Pritchard 2005;\nJenkins 2007. For a defense of Wright\u2019s views see for instance\nNeta 2007 and Wright 2014.)\n\nAs anticipated, other philosophers contend that Moore\u2019s proof\ndoes transmit justification and that its ineffectiveness has a\ndifferent explanation. An important conception of the architecture of\nperceptual justification, called dogmatism in Pryor (2000,\n2004), embraces a generalized form of liberalism about\nperceptual justification. This form of liberalism is opposed to\nWright\u2019s conservatism, and claims that to have\nprima facie perceptual justification for believing \\(p\\) from\nan apparent perception that \\(p, s\\) doesn\u2019t need independent\njustification for believing the negation of skeptical conjectures or\nnon-perceiving hypotheses like \\(\\notQ_8\\). This is so, for the\ndogmatist, because our experiences give us immediate and\nprima facie justification for believing their contents.\nSaying that perceptual justification is immediate is saying that it\ndoesn\u2019t presuppose\u2014not even in part\u2014justification\nfor anything else. Saying that justification is prima facie is saying\nthat it can be defeated by additional evidence. Our perceptual\njustification would be defeated, for example, by evidence that a\nrelevant non-perceiving hypothesis is true or just as probable as its\nnegation. For instance, \\(s\\)\u2019s perceptual justification for\n\\(\\rP_8\\) would be defeated by evidence that \\(\\notQ_8\\) is true, or\nthat\n \\(\\rQ_8\\)\n and \\(\\notQ_8\\) are equally probable. On this point the dogmatist and\nWright do agree. They disagree on whether \\(s\\)\u2019s perceptual\njustification for\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n requires independent justification for believing or accepting\n\\(\\rQ_8\\). The dogmatist denies that \\(s\\) needs that independent\njustification. Thus, according to the dogmatist, Moore\u2019s proof\ntransmits the perceptual justification available for its\npremise to the\n conclusion.[14]\n\nThe dogmatist argues (or may argue), however, that Moore\u2019s proof\nis dialectically flawed (cf. Pryor 2004). The contention is\nthat Moore\u2019s is unsuccessful because it is useless for the\npurpose to convince the idealist or the external world skeptic that\nthere is an external (material) world. In short, neither the idealist\nnor the global skeptic believes that there is an external world. Since\nthey don\u2019t believe\n \\(\\rQ_8\\),\n they are rationally required to distrust any perceptual\nevidence offered in favor of\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n in the first instance. For this reason they both will reject\nMoore\u2019s proof as one based on an unjustified\n premise.[15]\n Moretti (2014) suggests that the dogmatist could alternatively\ncontend that Moore\u2019s proof is non-transmissive because\n\\(s\\)\u2019s experience of a hand gives \\(s\\) immediate\njustification for believing both the premise \\(\\rP_8\\) and the\nconclusion \\(\\rQ_8\\) of the proof at once. According to this\ndiagnosis, Moore\u2019s proof is epistemically flawed\nbecause it instantiates a variant of indirectness (in which\nthe evidence is an experience of a hand). Pryor\u2019s\nanalysis of Moore\u2019s proof has principally been criticized in\nconjunction with his liberalism in epistemology of perception. (See\nCohen 2002, 2005; Schiffer 2004; Wright 2007; White 2006; Siegel &\nSilins 2015.)\n\nSome authors (e.g., Wright 2003; Pryor 2004; White 2006; Silins 2007;\nNeta 2010) have investigated whether certain variants of\nMoore are transmissive of justification. These arguments start from a\npremise like\n \\(\\rP_8\\),\n describing a (supposed) perceivable state of affairs of the external\nworld, and deduce from it the logical negation of a relevant\nskeptical conjecture. Consider for example the variant of\nMoore that starts from \\(\\rP_8\\) and replaces\n \\(\\rQ_8\\)\n with:\n\n\\(\\rQ_8^*\\).\n It is not the case that I am a handless brain in a vat fed with\nthe hallucination of a hand held up in front of my face.\n\n\nLet\u2019s call Moore* this variant of\n Moore.\n While dogmatists \u00e0 la Pryor argue that\nMoore* is transmissive but dialectically flawed (cf. Pryor\n2004), conservatives \u00e0 la Wright contend that it is\nnon-transmissive (cf. Wright 2007). Although it remains very\ncontroversial whether or not Moore is transmissive,\nepistemologists have found some prima facie reason to think\nthat arguments like Moore* are non-transmissive.\n\nAn important difference between Moore and Moore* is\nthis: whereas the logical negation of\n \\(\\rQ_8\\)\n does not explain the evidential statement\n \\(\\rE_8\\)\n (\u201cMy experience is in all respects as of a hand held up in\nfront of my face\u201d) adduced in support of\n \\(\\rP_8\\),\n the logical negation of\n \\(\\rQ_8^*\\)\u2014\\(\\notQ_8^*\\)\u2014somewhat\n explains \\(\\rE_8\\). Since \\(\\notQ_8^*\\) provides a potential\nexplanation of \\(\\rE_8\\), is it intuitive that \\(\\rE_8\\) is\nevidence (perhaps very week) for believing \\(\\notQ_8^*\\). It\nis easy to conclude from this that \\(s\\) cannot acquire justification\nfor believing \\(\\rQ_8^*\\) via transmission through Moore*\nupon learning \\(\\rE_8\\). For it is intuitive that if this were the\ncase, \\(\\rE_8\\) should count as evidence for \\(\\rQ_8^*\\). But this is\nimpossible: one and the same proposition cannot simultaneously be\nevidence for a hypothesis and its logical negation. By formalizing\nintuitions of this type, White (2006) has put forward a simple\nBayesian argument to the effect that Moore* and similar\nvariants of Moore are not transmissive of\n justification.[16]\n (See Silins 2007 for discussion. For responses to White, see\nWeatherson 2007; Kung 2010; Moretti 2015.)\n\nFrom the above analysis it is easy to conclude that the\ninformation-dependence template is satisfied by\nMoore* and akin proofs. In fact note that if\n \\(\\rE_8\\)\n is evidence for both\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n and \\(\\notQ_8^*\\), it seems correct to say that \\(s\\) can acquire a\njustification for believing \\(\\rP_8\\) only if \\(s\\) has independent\njustification for disbelieving \\(\\notQ_8^*\\) and thus\nbelieving \\(\\rQ_8^*\\). Since \\(\\notQ_8^*\\) counts as a\nnon-perceiving hypothesis for Pryor, this gives us a reason\nto doubt dogmatism (cf. White\n 2006).[17]\n\nColiva (2012, 2015) defends a view\u2014baptized by her\nmoderatism\u2014that aims to be a middle way between\nWright\u2019s conservatism and Pryor\u2019s dogmatism. The moderate\ncontends\u2014against the conservative\u2014that cornerstones cannot\nbe justified and that to possess perceptual justification \\(s\\) needs\nno justification for accepting any cornerstones. On the other hand,\nthe moderate claims\u2014against the dogmatist\u2014that to possess\nperceptual justification \\(s\\) needs to assume (without\njustification) relevant\n cornerstones.[18]\n By relying on her variant of the information-dependent\ntemplate described in\n Sect. 3.2,\n Coliva concludes that neither Moore nor any proof like\nMoore* is transmissive. (For a critical discussion of\nmoderatism see Avnur 2017; Baghramian 2017; Millar 2017; Volpe 2017;\nColiva 2017.)\n\nEpistemological disjunctivists like McDowell and Pritchard have argued\nthat in paradigmatic cases of perceptual knowledge, what is meant to\ngive \\(s\\) justification for believing\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n is, not\n \\(\\rE_8\\),\n but \\(s\\)\u2019s factive state of seeing that \\(\\rP_8\\). This seems\nto have consequences for the question whether Moore*\ntransmits propositional justification. Pritchard explicitly defends\nthe claim that when \\(s\\) sees that \\(\\rP_8\\), thereby learning that\n\\(\\rP_8, s\\) can come to know by inference from \\(\\rP_8\\) the negation\nof any skeptical hypothesis inconsistent with \\(\\rP_8\\), like\n \\(\\rQ_8^*\\)\n (cf. Pritchard 2012a: 129\u201330). This may encourage the belief\nthat, for Pritchard, Moore* can transmit the justification\nfor \\(\\rP_8\\), based on s\u2019s seeing that \\(\\rP_8\\), to\n\\(\\rQ_8^*\\) (see Lockhart 2018 for an explicit argument to this\neffect). This claim must however be handled with some care.\n\nAs we have seen in\n Sect. 2,\n Pritchard contends that when one knows \\(p\\) on the basis of evidence\n\\(e\\), one can know \\(p\\)\u2019s consequence \\(q\\) by inference from\n\\(p\\) only if \\(e\\) sufficiently supports \\(q\\). For Pritchard this\ncondition is met when \\(s\\)\u2019s support for believing\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n is constituted by \\(s\\)\u2019s seeing that \\(\\rP_8, s\\)\u2019s\nepistemic situation is objectively good (i.e., \\(s\\)\u2019s cognitive\nfaculties are working properly in a cooperative environment) and the\nskeptical hypothesis ruled out by\n \\(\\rQ_8^*\\)\n has not been epistemically motivated. For, in this case, \\(s\\) has a\nreflectively accessible factive support for believing\n\\(\\rP_8\\) that entails\u2014and so sufficiently\nsupports\u2014\\(\\rQ_8^*\\). Thus, in this case, nothing stands in the\nway of \\(s\\) competently deducing \\(\\rQ_8^*\\) from \\(\\rP_8\\), thereby\ncoming to know \\(\\rQ_8^*\\) on the basis of \\(\\rP_8\\).\n\nIf upon deducing one proposition from another, \\(s\\) comes to\njustifiably believe\n \\(\\rQ_8^*\\)\n for the first-time, the inference from\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n to \\(\\rQ_8^*\\) presumably transmits doxastic justification.\n(See the supplement on\n Transmission of Propositional Justification versus Transmission of Doxastic Justification.)\n It is more dubious, however, that when \\(s\\)\u2019s support for\n\\(\\rP_8\\) is constituted by \\(s\\)\u2019s seeing that \\(\\rP_8\\),\nMoore* is also transmissive of propositional\njustification. For instance, one might contend that Moore* is\nnon-transmissive because it instantiates the disjunctive\ntemplate described in\n Sect. 3.2\n (cf. Wright 2002). To start with, \\(\\rP_8\\) entails \\(\\rQ_8^*\\), so\n (D1)\n is satisfied. Let \\(\\rR^{*}_{\\textit{Moore}}\\) be the proposition\nthat this is no hand but \\(s\\) is victim of a hallucination of a hand\nheld up before her face. Since \\(\\rR^{*}_{\\textit{Moore}}\\) would be\ntrue if \\(\\rQ_8^*\\) were false,\n (D4)\n is also satisfied. Furthermore, take the grounds of \\(s\\)\u2019s\njustification for \\(\\rP_8\\) to be \\(s\\)\u2019s seeing that \\(\\rP_8\\).\nSince this experience is a state for \\(s\\) indistinguishable from one\nin which \\(\\rR^{*}_{\\textit{Moore}}\\) is true,\n (D2)\n is also satisfied. Finally, it might be argued that the proposition\nthat one is not hallucinating is a presupposition of the cognitive\nproject of learning about one\u2019s environment through perception.\nIt follows that \\(\\rR^{*}_{\\textit{Moore}}\\) is incompatible with a\npresupposition of \\(s\\)\u2019s cognitive project of learning about\none\u2019s environment through perception. Thus\n (D3\\(^{*}\\))\n appears fulfilled too. So, Moore* won\u2019t transmit the\njustification that \\(s\\) has for \\(\\rP_8\\) to \\(\\rQ_8^*\\).\n\nTo resist this conclusion, a disjunctivist might insist that\nMoore*, relative to \\(s\\)\u2019s support for\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n supplied by \\(s\\)\u2019s seeing that \\(\\rP_8\\), doesn\u2019t always\ninstantiate the disjunctive template because\n (D2)\n isn\u2019t necessarily fulfilled (cf. Lockhart 2018.) By invoking a\ndistinction drawn by Pritchard (2012a), one might contend that (D2)\nisn\u2019t necessarily fulfilled because \\(s\\), though unable to\nintrospectively discriminate seeing that \\(\\rP_8\\) from hallucinating\nit, may have evidence that favors the hypothesis that she is in the\nfirst state, which makes the state reflectively accessible. For\nPritchard, this happens\u2014as we have seen\u2014when \\(s\\) sees\nthat \\(\\rP_8\\) in good epistemic conditions and the skeptical\nconjecture that \\(s\\) is having a hallucination of a hand hasn\u2019t\nbeen epistemically motivated. In this case, \\(s\\) can come to know\n \\(\\rQ_8^*\\)\n by inference from \\(\\rP_8\\) even if she is unable to introspectively\ndiscriminate one situation from the other.\n\nPritchard\u2019s thesis that, in good epistemic conditions,\n\\(s\\)\u2019s factive support for believing\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n coinciding with \\(s\\)\u2019s seeing that \\(\\rP_8\\) is reflectively\naccessible is controversial (cf. Piazza 2016 and Lockhart 2018). Since\nthis thesis is essential to the contention that Moore* may\nnot instantiate the disjunctive template and may thus be\ntransmissive of propositional justification, the latter contention is\nalso controversial.\n\nSo far we have focused on perceptual justification. Now let\u2019s\nswitch to religious justification. Shaw (2019) aims to\nmotivate a view in religious epistemology\u2014he contends that the\n\u2018theist in the street\u2019, though unaware of the traditional\narguments for theism, can find independent rational support for\nbelieving that God exists through proofs for His existence. These\nproofs are based on religious experiences and parallel in structure\nMoore\u2019s proof of an external world interpreted as having the\npremise supported by an experience.\n\nA Moorean proof for the existence of God is one that deduces a belief\nthat God exists from what Alston (1991) calls a \u2018manifestation\nbelief\u2019 (M-belief, for short). An M-belief is a belief based\nnon-inferentially on a corresponding mystical experience. Typical\nM-beliefs are about God\u2019s acts toward a given subject at a given\ntime: for example, beliefs about God\u2019s bringing comfort to me,\nreproving me for some wrongdoing, or demonstrating His love for me,\nand so on. Here is Moorean proof for the existence of God:\n\nGod\n\n\\(\\rP_9\\).\n God is comforting me just now.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_9\\).\n God exists.\n\n\n\nNote that the \u2018good\u2019 case in which my experience that\n \\(\\rP_9\\)\n is veridical has a corresponding, subjectively indistinguishable,\n\u2018bad\u2019 case, in which it only seems to me that \\(\\rP_9\\)\nbecause I\u2019m suffering from a delusional religious experience. A\nconcern is, therefore, that God may instantiate the\ndisjunctive template. In this case, my experience as if\n\\(\\rP_9\\) could actually justify \\(\\rP_9\\) only if I had independent\njustification for\n \\(\\rQ_9\\)\n (cf. Pritchard 2012b). If so, God isn\u2019t\ntransmissive.\n\nShaw (2019) concedes that\n God\n is dialectically ineffective. To defend its transmissivity, he\nappeals to religious epistemological disjunctivism, which says that an\nM-belief that \\(p\\) can enjoy infallible rational support in virtue of\none\u2019s pneuming that \\(p\\), where this mental state is\nboth factive and accessible on reflection. Shaw intends\n\u2018pneuming that \\(p\\)\u2019 to stand as a kind of\nreligious-perceptual analogue to \u2018seeing that \\(p\\)\u2019 (cf.\nShaw 2016, 2019). When it comes to God, my belief that\n\\(\\rP_9\\) is supposed to be justified by my pneuming that God is\ncomforting me just now. As we have seen in the case of\nMoore*, a worry is that conceiving of the justification for\n\\(\\rP_9\\) along epistemological disjunctivist lines may not suffice to\nexempt God from the charge of instantiating the\ndisjunctive template and being thus non-transmissive.\n",
