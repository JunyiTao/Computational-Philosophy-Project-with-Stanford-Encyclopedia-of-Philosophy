    "main_text": "Ineffable\n11. Ineffable\n\nA fourth feature commonly taken to mark the divinity of God is his\nineffability. If he is so much greater than anything else, anything we\nsay of him would limit or falsify him, so we can speak at best in\nnegatives, or simply conclude that he is an ineffable mystery. It\nwould be hard to think of a line of reasoning less congenial to the\nrationalist spirit that has characterised many pantheists, for example\nscientific pantheism.\n\nAt the same time it must be allowed that there is a strong apophatic\nstreak in much pantheism. In contrast to his teacher, Thales, who\nthought it possible to specify the ground of all things as water, for\nAnaximander the one source from which cosmos comes forth (to\napeiron) is construed precisely in terms of its resistance to any\ndeterminate characterisation, while both Eriugena and Ibn \u2018Arabi\nstress that although the God of which we can speak is identical with\nthe cosmos, there remains another sense in which we cannot speak of\nGod at all. The essence of God considered in himself, the universal\nground of being cannot itself be captured by any of the limited\ncategories which flow out from it. Even Spinoza suggests that the\nhighest stages of knowledge consist in a form of intuitive insight,\nwhich transcends mere reasoning or conceptual knowledge in that it\nenables us to grasp the essence of individual things. Part of what he\ncalls \u2018the intellectual love of God\u2019, such scientia\nintuitiva is itself assigned a salvific role in Spinoza\u2019s\nthought; it is the path to human blessedness.\n",
