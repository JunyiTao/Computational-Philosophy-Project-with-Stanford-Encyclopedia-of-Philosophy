Finally, some object\nthat knowledge-how cannot be knowledge-that because the latter is\nacquirable by testimony and the former is not. While the following\nargument (A\u2013C) is valid, the following (i\u2013iii) is not\n(Poston 2016):\n\n Mark knows that Turin is in Northern Italy.\n Mark tells that to John, who believes him.\n John comes to know that Turin is in Northern Italy. \n\n\n Mark knows how John could swim.\n Mark tells John.\n John comes to know how to swim.\n\n\nFollowing Stanley\u2019s (2011b: 126) modal restriction proposal (cf.\n section 3),\n Cath (2017, 2019) responds that depending on how the context for the\nmodal is restricted, (i) could mean either that Mark knows\nhow John could swim given his current physical state or how\nJohn could swim after training. If only the latter, that is\nnot the sort of proposition that John needs to know in order for (iii)\nto be true: for that, John ought to know that that is how he could\nswim under his current physical state. (Though see\n section 2\n for qualms about this intellectualist strategy.) Another avenue for\nreply to the challenge from testimony may be to insist that not every\npropositional knowledge is transferable through testimony. A\ncomparison: visual knowledge that Mark murdered Tina differs in\ncontent and mode of presentation from the knowledge that of the murder\nobtained by being told by his prosecutor. The former observational\nknowledge is not transferable through mere testimony but (exactly\nbecause of that!) it is more helpful for the purpose of convicting\nMark than second-hand knowledge. That does not mean that observational\nknowledge is not propositional. Like in the case of perceptual\nknowledge, the proposition that one knows by knowing how to do\nsomething involves distinct modes of presentation of ways of doing\nthings\n (section 2,\n section 3). We should not expect propositions under this mode of\npresentation to be transferable through testimony. (For a response to\nPoston 2016, see also Peet 2019).\n",
