In almost every history of medieval philosophy,\nhis censure is presented as one of the most important events in\nfourteenth-century Paris. In the older literature, Autrecourt\u2019s\nviews have become linked to allegedly skeptical tendencies in\nscholastic thought, and have been unduly shadowed by assumptions about\ntheir relation to the views of William of Ockham. Over the last two\ndecades, however, it has become apparent that the study of\nAutrecourt\u2019s thought has been wrongly placed in the larger\ncontext of the battle against Ockhamism at the University of Paris in\nthe years 1339\u20131347. Although Autrecourt was no skeptic \u2014 on the\ncontrary, he attacked the \u201cAcademics\u201d or ancient Skeptics\n\u2014 his philosophical stance challenges the prevailing\nAristotelian tradition. In particular, Autrecourt rejected some of the\nmain tenets of scholastic metaphysics and epistemology, such as the\nsubstance-accident structure of reality and the principle of\ncausality.\n", "toc": [{"#Lif": "1.

Life\n\n\nAs is the case with many medieval thinkers, Autrecourt\u2019s\nbiographical details are few. What we know about his intellectual life\nhas to be reconstructed using dates that are attached to the handful of\ndocuments in which he is mentioned. One of these is a record from\nsometime between 1333\u201336, indicating that he served as prior at the\nColl\u00e8ge de Sorbonne. Another important document is a papal\nletter of 1338 in which Benedict XII confers upon him the function of\ncanon at Metz Cathedral, and refers to him as a master of arts and\nbachelor of theology and civil law. Evidently, however, Autrecourt did\nnot claim his prebendary stipend until after his trial in 1347.\n\n\nOn the basis of such references, Autrecourt\u2019s date of birth can be\nplaced sometime between 1295\u201398. He originated from Autr\u00e9court\nin the diocese of Verdun, and was probably a student in the arts\nfaculty at Paris, belonging to either the English, or, more likely, the\nFrench nation. His master\u2019s degree in arts can be dated around 1318\u201320.\nWhile a student, he must have come across such famous masters as John\nof Jandun, Marsilius of Padua, Thomas Wilton, Walter Burley,\nBartholomew of Bruges, or Siger of Courtrai. Since his law degree was\nin civil rather than canon law, he must have left Paris at some point\nfor a minimum of five years, probably to study at Orl\u00e9ans,\nAvignon, or Montpellier.\n\n\nHis membership in the Coll\u00e8ge de Sorbonne places Autrecourt\nback in Paris in the 1330s as a student of theology. On November 21,\n1340, Pope Benedict XII summoned him from Paris to Avignon to respond\nto allegations of false teaching. In his letter, the pope refers to\nAutrecourt as a licentiatus in theology, meaning that\nAutrecourt had fullfilled the formal requirements for the theology\ndegree, e.g., lecturing on the Bible and the Sentences. But\ndoes it also mean that he was a full-fledged master of theology? The\nquestion is controversial. In the judgment at his trial, it was\nstipulated that Autrecourt could only obtain \u201cmagisterial honor and\ndegree\u201d after special permission from the Apostolic See, which seems\nto imply that he was not allowed to progress to inception in theology\n(the ceremony in which the magisterial honors would be conferred)\nuntil the pope decided otherwise. Moreover, there are no records\nreferring to Autrecourt as a master in theology. This suggests that\nAutrecourt remained a licentiatus in theology when he moved\non to Metz to take his position as canon (and later dean) of the\ncathedral chapter.  He died in 1369, on either July 16 or 17.  Another\nscenario is that Autrecourt\u2019s licenciate in theology was removed as a\nresult of his conviction and that it had been restored by the time\nthat he was confirmed as dean of the chapter at Metz (Courtenay, in\nCaroti and Grellard, 2006, pp. 42\u201343).\n2. Autrecourt\u2019s Trial and Conviction\n\n\nAutrecourt\u2019s time of trial began in 1340 when he was first summoned\nto appear before the papal court in Avignon and lasted until his\nconviction in 1346. An extensive, though as yet incomplete, dossier of\nthe judicial process at Avignon has been preserved in the form of an\ninstrumentum publicum (actually, a draft copy thereof), which\nserved as a model for the preparation of the official record of the\nprocess. The papal dossier contains copies of a number of records that\nplayed a role during earlier stages of Autrecourt\u2019s trial, and gives an\naccount (narratio) of the judicial proceedings from the moment\nCardinal Curti, the judge, took over the investigation.\n\n\nThe record specifies the charges and summarizes the false teachings\nof which Autrecourt was accused in the form of four lists, together\ntotalling 66 erroneous propositions or \u201carticles\u201d (articuli).\nThe articles were culled from Autrecourt\u2019s writings and oral teachings.\nOn the basis of this record, it would appear that the papal commissions\nof Pope Clement VI and Cardinal Curti used evidence from earlier\nproceedings at the University of Paris and Autrecourt\u2019s response to\nthis evidence to reach their verdicts. If this scenario is correct, it\nraises two obvious questions: why was Autrecourt\u2019s trial transferred\nfrom Paris to Avignon, and how did it begin in the first place?\nUnfortunately, the surviving historical evidence is insufficient to\nanswer either question.\n\n\nThe commission of prelates and theologians, which under the\nchairmanship of Cardinal Curti had discussed all of the articles\nattributed to Autrecourt, came to the conclusion that they contained\nmany false, dangerous, presumptuous, suspect, erroneous, and heretical\nstatements. For this reason, Autrecourt\u2019s writings were ordered burned\neither at Pr\u00e9-aux-Clercs or Pr\u00e9-de-Saint-Germain at Paris\nat an unspecified future date. Moreover, Autrecourt was ordered to\npublicly recant several of the articles specified in the legal record.\nThese recantations and declarations, which Autrecourt was first\nrequired to make at the palace of Cardinal Curti in Avignon, had to be\nrepeated at the University of Paris. Autrecourt\u2019s recantation at the\npapal court took place before May 19, 1346. The exact date is unknown\nbecause it was left blank in the draft prepared by the notary Bernard.\nIn addition to the recantation, Autrecourt was declared unworthy to\nascend to the magisterial rank in the theological faculty. Anyone in\npossession of the authority to present or promote Autrecourt to the\nmagisterium of the faculty of theology was thereafter forbidden to do\nso.\n\n\nThe Parisian part of the sentence was fulfilled the following year.\nOn November, 20, 1347 the regent and non-regent masters of the\nuniversity met at the Church of Saint-Mathurin, where papal letters\nand the process \u201cconcerning certain articles\u201d were\nread. This material had been brought from Avignon by Autrecourt\nhimself. On November 25, Autrecourt recanted the four confessed\narticles and the articles from the letter \u201cVe\nmichi\u201d in the Church of the Dominicans, and publicly\ndeclared that the propositions contained in the other two lists were\nwrong. In addition, he burned these articles and a treatise, most\nlikely the Exigit ordo. The public reading of the\ninstrumentum and the recantation served an important purpose.\nIt not only made the sentence effective, but also informed the\nscholarly community of Autrecourt\u2019s errors and of the punishments set\nout in the instrumentum, which they would incur if they were\nto teach the censured errors. Years later, scholars such as John\nBuridan, Marsilius of Inghen, and Andr\u00e9 of Neufch\u00e2teau\n(Andreas de Novo Castro) cited the condemned erroneous propositions as\nthe articuli cardinalis (albi).\n3. Writings\n\n\nAutrecourt\u2019s oeuvre is not large. There is a correspondence with the\nFranciscan theologian Bernard of Arezzo, and with a certain Master\nGiles (possibly Giles of Feno), and a treatise that has come to be\nknown as the Exigit ordo. Furthermore, we have a theological\nquestion dealing with the intension and remission of forms and the\nproblem of minima and maxima (utrum visio alicuius rei naturalis\npossit naturali intendi [Could the vision of any natural thing be\nnaturally intensified?]).\n\n\nAutrecourt wrote nine letters to Bernard of Arezzo, only two of\nwhich survive. In addition, there is one letter from master Giles\naddressed to Autrecourt, along with a brief response by the latter,\nwhich, however, breaks off in mid-sentence. The correspondence has been\npreserved in two manuscript copies from the intellectual milieu of the\nColl\u00e8ge de Sorbonne. Together the letters form a small dossier,\nthe central item of which is the letter from Master Giles. Apparently,\nthe only reason the two letters to Bernard were copied was because they\nare mentioned in the letter from Master Giles. The correspondence\nbetween Autrecourt and Bernard of Arezzo is much earlier, dating from\nthe time when both were theology students, engaged as opponents in each\nother\u2019s Principia, i.e., inaugural lecture on the\nSentences. They can be dated between October 1335 and June\n1336, although both Principia are now lost. There is no\nevidence that Autrecourt ever actually wrote a commentary on the\nSentences, which, in any case was not a formal requirement for\nobtaining a degree. The theme of the discussion in the\nPrincipia and the letters to Bernard of Arezzo is the validity\nof Aristotle\u2019s principle of non-contradiction, as presented in Book IV\nof the Metaphysics.\n\n\nThe Exigit ordo is the fruit of Autrecourt\u2019s teaching in the\narts faculty. In the first of its two prologues, it is addressed to\nthe reverendi patres, i.e. to the theologians in religious\norders. Instead of expounding his views in commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s\ntexts, Autrecourt chose to write an independent treatise discussing\nissues pertaining to natural philosophy, metaphysics, epistemology,\nphilosophical psychology, and ethics, and engaging in debate with\nunnamed contemporaries. The work is not a neat sequence of chapters or\nquestions with pro and con arguments. It has been suggested that the\nExigit was a draft version in which Autrecourt had penned\nideas, arguments and fragments of disputations that were awaiting\ntheir final ordering. The work was completed in the years 1333\u201335, at\nwhich time Autrecourt was preparing his commentary on the\nSentences. For financial reasons, Autrecourt taught in the\narts faculty while he was enrolled as a student in theology. Possibly,\nhe even wrote the Exigit after he commented on the\nSentences, but before 1340, when he was summoned to\nAvignon.\n\n\nThe Exigit ordo is also known as the Tractatus\nuniversalis (Universal Treatise). The latter title is actually a\nmisreading of the first two words of the treatise, \u201ctractatus\nutilis\u201d (useful treatise). It has been preserved in a single\nmanuscript copy, which, like the Giles letter, breaks off in\nmid-sentence. It is divided into two prologues, two treatises, and\nseveral chapters, which, unfortunately, the scribe has placed in the\nwrong order. The Latin edition and English translation both preserve\nthe order of the medieval manuscript without correction.\n\n\nThe theological question is a report (reportatio) of a\ntheological disputation in which Autrecourt served as respondent to\nthe objections. Although the presiding master of a disputation would\nusually have to be considered its real author, matters may be\ndifferent here. Since it is a reportatio \u2014 i.e., a text\nwhich, unlike an ordinatio, was not subjected to later\nediting by the master himself \u2014 Autrecourt\u2019s views probably\nappear in unadulterated form.  The question was disputed between\n1336\u201339, and has been little studied by scholars.\n4. Epistemology\n\n\nCentral to Autrecourt\u2019s teaching is the view that all evident\nknowledge (with the exception of the certitude of faith) must be\nreducible to the first principle (primum principium), i.e.,\nto the principle of non-contradiction. An inference yields evident\nknowledge only when the affirmation of its antecedent and the negation\nof its consequent are contradictory. This means that the antecedent and\nthe consequent, or, more precisely, what is signified by the\nantecedent and the consequent, must be identical, \u201cbecause if this\nwere not the case, it would not be immediately evident that the\nantecedent and the opposite of the consequent cannot stand together\nwithout contradiction.\u201d It is in the context of this theory that\nAutrecourt launches an attack on our claim to have certain knowledge\nof the existence of substances and causal relations. If A and B are\ntwo distinct entities, he says, one cannot infer with certainty\n(knowledge of) the existence of A from that of B or vice versa, for\nthe affirmation of the one and the denial of the other does not result\nin a contradiction. On the basis of this principle, one may not infer\n(knowledge of) the existence of effects from knowledge of their\ncauses, nor (knowledge of) the existence of substances from knowledge\nof their accidents. Autrecourt\u2019s theory about the evidentness of\ninferences was contested by his contemporaries and should be\nunderstood in the light of the late-medieval theory of\nconsequences.\n\n\nThis view runs contrary to the Aristotelian position, according to\nwhich causal relations really exist and are discoverable by means of\ninduction, so that the existence of substances can be inferred from the\nperceptible accidents inhering in them. The upshot of Autrecourt\u2019s view\nis that we do not have experience of causal relations or substances,\nnor does logic provide certain knowledge of them. There are no logical\nreasons to assume that there is an evident relation between a cause and\nan effect, or between a substance and an accident.\n\n\nThe position outlined above is developed in Autrecourt\u2019s\ncorrespondence. It has led historians of philosophy to characterize\nhim as the most important, if not the only, \u201creal\u201d\nrepresentative of medieval scepticism, as \u201cthe medieval\nHume\u201d, to use Hastings Rashdall\u2019s epithet. On closer\ninspection, however, it turns out that Autrecourt\u2019s scepticism\nis reserved for rationalist claims about the truth of our commitments\nto causality and substance, concepts for which we have no empirical\nproof. It is now generally agreed that he is not a sceptic at all when\nit comes to defending the reliability of sense-perception.\n\n\nIn his Letter to Bernard, Autrecourt takes on Bernard of\nArezzo, who had argued that the intellect is neither certain of the\nexistence of those things of which it has a clear intuitive cognition,\nnor of its own acts. Autrecourt reveals the full implications of this\nposition by pointing out to Bernard that \u201cyou are not certain of\nthose things which are outside of you. And so you do not know if you\nare in the sky or on earth, in fire or in water...Similarly, you do\nnot know what things exist in your immediate surroundings, such as\nwhether you have a head, a beard, hair, and the like.\u201d He\nconcludes that Bernard\u2019s stance is even worse than that of\n\u201cthe Academics,\u201d that is, the ancient Skeptics.\n5. Metaphysics\n\n\nTo Bernard\u2019s skeptical challenges Autrecourt replies that sense\nexperience is reliable. This theme is not further developed in the\nletters to Bernard, however. For discussion of this topic we must turn\nto the Exigit ordo. In one section of this treatise, which is\nreminiscent of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics IV, 5, Autrecourt\naddresses one of the central issues of metaphysics, namely the relation\nbetween appearance and reality. He addresses Protagoras\u2019 view that\nwhatever is apparent is true: An omne illud quod apparet sit?\n(Does everything that appears exist?).\n\n\nAutrecourt defends the thesis that what appears, is, and that what\nappears true, is true. He finds this view more plausible than its\nopposite, viz., that the intellect cannot possess\ncertitude. Autrecourt does not have a meta-theory in which he defends\nhis model of certain knowledge against alternative theories. His\nappeal that his theory is the more probable one, however, saves him\nfrom charges of dogmatism. His concept of appearance plays a key role\nin his doctrine of certain knowledge. It is used in a phenomenological\nsense, to describe perceptual experiences. According to Autrecourt,\nthe intellect is certain of everything that is evident to it in the\nfinal analysis. This is the case for everything that appears in a\nproper sense (apparet proprie), i.e., that appears clearly in\nan act of the external senses (in actu sensuum\nexteriorum). He identifies appearances with the objects of\nimmediate sensory experience, which are considered evident. In this\nway, he implies that sense perception is a reliable source of truth,\ni.e., that the apparent properties of an object are its actual\nproperties.\n\n\nBut is sense perception reliable? Perceptual errors and dreams seem to\nindicate that things are not always as they seem. Autrecourt discusses\nseveral sceptical doubts (dubia), versions of what would\nlater be called the \u201cargument from illusion\u201d and the\n\u201cargument from dreaming\u201d. These arguments work from the\ncommon sense assumption that things often appear to be other than they\nare: e.g., sweet food can appear bitter, a white object can appear\nred, in sleep it can seem to someone that he is flying through the air\nor fighting the Saracens.\n\n\nAutrecourt responds to these sceptical doubts by distinguishing\nbetween appearance and judgment. Appearances are always veridical:\nexperience cannot be other than it is. However, judgments made from\nexperience can be erroneous, especially if they are based on images\nrather than on what is perceived \u201cin the full light.\u201d In\nother words, Autrecourt denies any conflict of appearances. Those not\n\u201cin the full light\u201d are not in themselves misperceptions\nbecause the experiences themselves are not illusory. They merely fail\nto give us the real properties of the object perceived. Potential\nconflict creeps in at the level of judgment, where ontological claims\nare made on the basis of appearances. Only those appearances that are\n\u201cin the full light\u201d reveal the true properties of the\nperceived object, and only they can provide the basis for true\njudgments. Appearances of objects that do not come to the perceiver\n\u201cin the full light\u201d are incomplete or contaminated, as if\nthe observer were looking into a mirror. In other words, Autrecourt\ncarefully distinguishes between \u2018x\nappears F\u2019 from \u2018x is F\u2019,\nfor even if x is not really F, it can still appear\nF and cause someone to believe that it is F. In this\nway, illusions and dreams turn into mistaken beliefs.  Only clear\nappearances (apparentiae clarae) can cause veridical\njudgments.\n\n\nA final topic taken up by Autrecourt in this context is the problem of\nthe criterion: How can one discriminate between appearances that\nprovide the basis for true judgments and those that do not? Like\nAristotle, he holds that appearances from what we perceive under\n\u201cnormal\u201d conditions cause true judgments. Also like Aristotle, he\nasserts that there is no further proof that the criterion on which the\ndistinction between veridical and false judgments rests is correct.\nBoth dismiss worries about the justification of the criterion as\nabsurd. In the words of Autrecourt: \u201cOne must accept as true what\nappears in the full light. Now, concerning the minor premise of this\nargument, how can you have certainty? \u2026 One way of answering\nthis would be to say that there is no way of proving the conclusion,\nbut that the concept of certitude which is present comes as a certain\nnatural consequence, and not as a conclusion. An example, among\nothers, is that white and black are different. This concept of their\ndifference is not gotten by way of conclusion.\u201d\n\n\nThe reason why our senses can give us veridical access to the objects\nis, because these objects determine the contents of what\nappears. Autrecourt believes that there is a necessary connnection\nbetween the mental act and the object of which it is a mental act. The\nobject \u201cconfigurates\u201d the mental act, which becomes identical to\nit. The metaphysical foundation of this theory is Autrecourt\u2019s\nrealism: he assumes that the same universal nature manifests itself in\nnumerically different objects in the world, and in the mind, although\nin the latter in a different mode of being (secundum aliud esse\nobjectivum) (Kaluza, 1998; Perler, in Caroti and Grellard,\n2006).\n6. Natural Philosophy\n\n\nThe point of departure for Autrecourt\u2019s physics is a thesis which\nstrikes him as more probable than its opposite, namely that all things\nare eternal. Autrecourt assures the reader that he is speaking as a\nnatural philosopher, and that he is not contradicting Catholic\nfaith. One of the implications of his thesis is that there is no\ngeneration or corruption in the universe. Autrecourt refutes\nAverroes\u2019s (and Aristotle\u2019s) doctrine of prime matter in which\nsubstantial forms are generated and corrupted. He replaces the theory\nof hylemorphism, which attributes the coming-to-be and passing-away of\nproperties and of objects to forms that begin and cease to exist in\nmatter, by atomism. Change in the natural world is caused by the\nmovement of atoms. These atoms are to be understood as infinitely\nsmall parcels of matter which have properties.\n\n\nAs Autrecourt explicitly indicates, his discussion of the eternity of\nthings is linked to his views on motion and on atomism. For this\nreason, he places the section on the divisibility of matter in between\nhis treatment of eternity and of motion, \u201cbecause some of the points\nto be raised about indivisibles will prepare us for the question of\nmovement\u201d. What Autrecourt means is that a number of arguments about\nthe divisibility of space and time involve moving objects.\n\n\nAutrecourt opens his discussion of atoms or indivisibles by restating\nAristotle\u2019s position that no continuum is composed of indivisibles. He\npresents five arguments in support of this thesis, and places beside\nthem his own counterarguments, which are meant to prove \u201cwith\nsufficient probability\u201d the opposite conclusion. The section makes\nclear that Autrecourt is familiar with the contemporary debates at\nParis about the divisibility of the continuum. It is not possible,\nhowever, to identify his opponents, and at times his discussion lacks\ncoherence. In keeping with this atomistic view, he also holds that\nspace and time consist of indivisible units, viz., points and\ninstants, respectively.\n\n\nThe discussion of motion, which focuses on its ontological status, is\nplaced in the larger context of a discussion of quantity. The reason\nis, that motion is one particular type of quantity, namely successive\nquantity (as distinct from permanent quantity). Autrecourt argues that\nmaterial substance and its quantity are not distinct. The same holds\ntrue for other characteristic properties of a substance, the sensible\nqualities: they are not distinct from their substance. Autrecourt\nclaims, for instance, that fire and its heat and water and its\ncoldness are not distinct. At the background of this section is the\nlate-medieval debate about the basic ontological categories, induced\nby Aristotle\u2019s Categories and Metaphysics. Given\nthese preliminaries, it comes as no surprise that Autrecourt also\ndefends the thesis that motion is not distinct from the mobile\nobject.\n\n\nAutrecourt argues that motion is not a thing distinct from the\nmoving object. Following Ockham, he rejects the idea that motion is a\npositive thing inhering in the mobile object. Thus, the loss of motion\nshould not be described as the destruction or corruption of an entity,\nand the eternity doctrine is saved.\n7. Semantics\n\n\nAutrecourt did not leave any logical writings, nor does he discuss\nlogic or semantics in the Exigit ordo or in his\ncorrespondence. However, from his theological question and a few of\nthe censured articles it is clear that he was familiar with the\nlogical debates of his time. According to one of the articles,\nAutrecourt claimed that the proposition \u201cMan is an animal\u201d\nis not necessary according to the faith, because in that sense one\ndoes not attend to the necessary connection between its terms. The\narticle should be seen against the background of the sophism\n\u201cMan is an animal\u201d, which received considerable attention\nin the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. It served to clarify the\nrelation between meaning (significatio) and reference\n(suppositio) by investigating the verification of\npropositions concerning empty classes. Would the proposition\n\u201cMan is an animal\u201d still be true if no man exists? This\narticle suggests that Autrecourt may have denied any form of natural\nand metaphysical necessity, and for this reason was condemned (Zupko,\nin Caroti and Grellard, 2006, p. 186)\n\n\nFive other articles that turn up in Autreourt\u2019s condemnation\nconcern the complexe significabile, or what is signified by\nan entire proposition. According to adherents of the doctrine such as\nAdam Wodeham and Gregory of Rimini, the object of knowledge is not the\nproposition, or the things (res) referred to in the external\nworld, but \u201cthat which is signified\u201d by the proposition\n(complexe significabile). One of the problems raised by this\ntheory concerned the ontological status of the complexe\nsignificabile: Is it something (aliquid) or nothing\n(nihil)? Echoes of this and other debates can be found in\nthese articles.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"EdiTra\">Editions and Translations</a>", "<a name=\"Stu\">Studies</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"EdiTra\">Editions and Translations</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul>", "Edition of the <em>Exigit Ordo</em> and the theological question\n\u201c<em>Utrum visio alicuius rei naturalis possit naturali intendi</em>\u201d\nin: O\u2018Donnell, J.
