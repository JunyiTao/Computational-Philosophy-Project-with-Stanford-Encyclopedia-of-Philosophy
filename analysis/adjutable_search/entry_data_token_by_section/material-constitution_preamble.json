    "main_text": "\n\nWhat is the relationship between a clay statue and the lump of clay\nfrom which it is formed? We might say that the lump\nconstitutes the statue, but what is this relation of\nmaterial constitution? Some insist that constitution is\nidentity, on the grounds that distinct material objects cannot\noccupy the same place at the same time. Others argue that\nconstitution is not identity, since the statue and the lump\ndiffer in important respects. Still others take cases like this to\nmotivate revisionary views about persistence, identity, or\nexistence.\n\nThis article presents some of the most important puzzles of material\nconstitution and evaluates some of the most popular replies.\n",
