    "main_text": "Paradoxes, predicativism and the doctrine of types: 1905\u20131913 || Completing the picture\n3.3 Completing the picture\n\nThere is a sizeable literature on paradoxes already in the early years\nof the 20th century, which is not at all exhausted by the\nprevious discussion. Refinements and variations of foundational and\nlogical interest are to be found in the works of several authors,\nincluding prominent mathematicians, among them Peano, Borel,\nSch\u00f6nflies, Brouwer, and Weyl. Some of the more stimulating and\noriginal proposals are surveyed in the rest of this section.\n3.3.1 Peano, Sch\u00f6nflies, Brouwer, and Borel\n\nPeano\u2019s criticism (in Additione a Super Theorema de\nCantor-Bernstein) of Richard\u2019s paradox is mainly known\nbecause it points out that \u201cRichard\u2019s example pertains\nto linguistics, not to mathematics\u201d and this statement\nopens up the distinction between set-theoretic or mathematical\nantinomies and semantical antinomies: the weak point in\nRichard\u2019s definition is that to some extent it is symbolic and\nformal, but it also makes use of the natural language\n(\u201clingua commune\u201d); this contains ideas that are\nquite familiar but nevertheless are not sharply defined and are\nambiguous (Peano 1906, p. 357\u2013358). For instance, there is no\nprecise criterion for deciding whether a given expression of the\nnatural language represents a rule uniquely defining a number.\n\nIn spite of that, Peano elaborated a formal solution. He tried to get\nrid of vagueness and reference to \\(E\\), the set of finitely definable\nreals in the unit interval, by fixing an explicit\n\u201cG\u00f6del-numbering\u201d: given a natural number \\(n\\),\nwrite \\(n\\) in base \\(B\\), for sufficiently large \\(B\\) (so as to\ninclude the number of alphabet letters plus punctuation marks). Then\neach number is assigned a finite string of symbols in the natural\nlanguage, and in certain cases the string will define a number,\n\\(\\Val(n) =\\) \u201cthe decimal number which is determined by the\nexpression encoded by \\(n\\) and interpreted according to the rules of\nthe natural language\u201d. Now, in order to get the paradox, one has\nto prove that there exists a unique number \\(N\\) in (0, 1), satisfying\nthe condition given by Richard (see\n 2.5\n above), but this condition, and hence \\(N\\) itself, depends on\n\\(\\Val\\), which is possibly obscure and cannot be defined exactly\naccording to the rules of mathematics (p. 352, p. 358). The conclusion\nis that no such a real can exist and Richard\u2019s definition is\ndefective in the same way that \u201cthe greatest prime number\u201d\nis.\n\nSch\u00f6nflies and Brouwer, by contrast, reacted to the paradoxes\nwhile strongly opposing axiomatic and formal methods.\n\nSch\u00f6nflies (1906) stuck to a contentual, genetic conception of\nsets. According to him, sets are generated and, once formed, are\nconceptually invariant. When a new set is built up, it is added to\nthose that have been used in forming it, without altering their\npre-existent structure. So self-membership does not make sense, the\nuniversal set does not exist and Russell\u2019s paradox disappears.\nHis view can be seen as hinting at a sort of iterative conception of\nsets. For Sch\u00f6nflies, the contradictions arise in logic, as\nopposed to mathematics, and are due to the scholastic nature of logic.\nHe regarded logic as having an unhealthy influence\n(\u201cunheilvollen Einfl\u00fcss\u201d) on mathematics\n(\u201cF\u00fcr den Cantorismus, aber gegen den\nRussellismus\u201d is the final motto of Sch\u00f6nflies\n1911).\n\nBrouwer\u2019s approach to paradoxes was also based on a contentual\nconception of mathematics. It can be found in the dissertation of\n1907, chapter III (cf. also van Dalen 1999, pp. 105). As to\nRussell\u2019s contradiction, Brouwer noticed that the usual logical\nprinciples only hold for words with mathematical content, not for\nlinguistic systems, like those of Peano or Russell. For instance, in\norder to decide whether a class falls under a propositional function,\nthe class has to be a completed totality. The contradictions show that\nthere are propositional functions which define complementary\n(disjoint) classes and yet do not satisfy the tertium non datur.\nSimilar ideas can be found in the philosophical paper of 1908,\n\u201cOn the unreliability of tertium non datur\u201d (see van Dalen\n1999).\n\nA positive by-product of Richard\u2019s paradox in Brouwer\u2019s\nwork (1907, p. 149) is the notion of denumerably unfinished\nset, i.e., a set in which we can determine only denumerable\nsubsets of elements, but where these denumerable subsets do not\nexhaust the given set, so that one can immediately produce new\nelements of the set from any given denumerable such subset. Typical\nexamples of denumerably unfinished sets are the totality of countable\nordinals, the points of the continuum, and in particular, as could be\nshown using Richard\u2019s paradox, the set of all definable points\nof the continuum (1907, p. 150). Brouwer considers\nBurali-Forti\u2019s contradiction not as a mathematical paradox,\nsince it concerns a logical structure (the collection of all\nordinals), which is not a well-defined mathematical object and has no\nproper mathematical content. Mathematically speaking, the\ncontradiction can be avoided by denying that the largest well-ordered\ntype has a successor order type (p. 153; this is analogous to\nBernstein 1905b).\n\nAmong the French mathematicians, the semi-intuitionist Borel (1908)\nintroduced the distinction between effectively enumerable\nsets and denumerable ones. The Richard paradox is then solved\nby observing that Richard\u2019s set \\(E\\) is certainly denumerable,\nbecause one can only determine at most a denumerable set of reals by\nfinite means. Yet \\(E\\) is not effectively enumerable, i.e., one\ncannot produce with finitely many words a procedure for assigning\nunambiguously a rank (i.e., a position) to each element of the set. In\norder to make the enumeration of \\(E\\) effective, one ought to have\nsolved all the mathematical problems which one could possibly state,\nbecause there are expressions which become definitions of a real only\nmodulo a proof or solution of a certain problem. Borel has in mind a\nparticular example: consider the expression \u201cthe unique\ntranscendental number whose decimal expansion is obtained from that of\n\\(\\pi\\) by replacing everywhere 7 with 8, and 8 with 7\u201d. Of\ncourse, this is a good definition only if we have shown that the\nnumber is not algebraic (see Borel 1908. p. 446).\n\nBorel, like Poincar\u00e9, adheres to a point of\nview\u2014definability in finitely many words\u2014which is an\nextension of the algebraic, Kroneckerian point of view: only objects\nconstructible in finitely many steps are proper mathematical objects.\nHowever, unlike Poincar\u00e9, he disregards the problem of\npredicative definitions: for him all paradoxes of set theory derive\nfrom viewing the proposition that every denumerable set is effectively\nenumerable (\u201cTout ensemble d\u00e9nombrable est\neffectivement \u00e9num\u00e9rable\u201d) as evident, which\nis false.\n3.3.2 Hessenberg, Grelling, Zermelo and Weyl\n\nOn the side of mathematical foundations, three chapters of Gerhard\nHessenberg\u2019s Bericht (1906) on the fundamentals of set\ntheory are devoted to foundational questions. They contain interesting\nideas about the philosophy of mathematics, which unfortunately cannot\nbe discussed in detail here. For instance, Hessenberg underlines the\ndistinction between set theoretic definitions which give criteria for\neffectively deciding membership in a given set, and\ndefinitions which don\u2019t. Concerning Kronecker\u2019s\nconstructive criticism of the arithmetized continuum, he holds that,\nalthough each irrational number determines an infinite fraction and\neach infinite fraction possesses a formation rule\n(\u201cBildungsgesetz\u201d), it is not true that such a rule is\ngiven by explicit finite means. For otherwise, we could\nderive (a form of) the paradox of finite denotation, i.e.,\nwere formation laws to coincide with definable ones, they would be at\nmost denumerable and hence the reals would be denumerable, against\nCantor\u2019s theorem.\n\nIn dealing with set theoretic contradictions, Hessenberg distinguishes\nthe \u2018ultrafinite\u2019 (paragraphs 96\u201399) from the\n\u2018transfinite\u2019: this latter notion is an exclusive\nattribute of sets. By contrast, the collections involved in the\nparadoxes (such as the Russell set, the set of all sets, of all\nthings, and of all ordinal numbers) are ultrafinite.\n\nAs to the proposed solutions of the paradoxes, Hessenberg was inspired\nby a Kantian idea. Just as in the natural sciences antinomies arise if\nNature is conceived as a closed whole, similarly the collection\n\\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) and the set of all sets cannot be conceived as\ncompleted totalities. Hence the distinction\n\u2018ultrafinite\u2019/\u2018transfinite\u2019 is apparently in\naccord with a theoretical approach which is close to Russell\u2019s\nlimitation of size doctrine.\n\nClose to the same philosophical inspiration, the influential paper of\nGrelling and Nelson (1908) provides an attempt to unify paradoxes and\nto isolate their underlying structure. The philosopher Leonard Nelson\nwas a prominent figure in the G\u00f6ttingen of the early twentieth\ncentury, who had Hilbert\u2019s strong support (see Peckhaus 1990).\nThe paper is part of a project to develop a philosophically minded\n\u201ckritische Mathematik\u201d. It contains a new paradox\n(credited to Grelling) with a semantical flavor (see also the entry\n self-reference):\n\nTo each word there corresponds a concept, that the very word\ndesignates, and which applies to it or does not apply; in the first\ncase, we call the word autological, else\nheterological. Now the word \u2018heterological\u2019\nitself is autological or heterological. Assuming that the word is\nautological, the concept that it designates applies, hence\n\u2018heterological\u2019 is heterological. But if the word is\nheterological, the designated concept does not apply, so\n\u2018heterological\u2019 is not heterological.\n\n\nZermelo\u2019s axiomatization of set theory (1908; for more details\nsee entries on\n set theory,\n the early development of set theory,\n alternative axiomatic set theories)\n supplied a sensible tool for blocking contradictions. The main ideas\nof the axiomatization can be summarized as follows: (i) na\u00efve\ncomprehension is restricted to a separation axiom, i.e., to a\nprinciple granting the existence of enough subsets of an already given\nset of objects (numbers, points, functions on a given space);\n\u2018enough subsets\u2019 here refers to all the subsets\nspecifiable by means of definite conditions involving the\nprimitive notions (set equality and membership) and satisfying the\nlaws of classical logic; (ii) there are axioms ensuring that the basic\noperations of forming singleton, union, pairing, and power set are\nwell defined and that there exist at least an infinite set and the\nempty set; (iii) extensionality is assumed: two sets are equal if and\nonly if they have the same elements; (iv) an axiom of choice is\npostulated, which allows selecting a choice set out of any family of\ndisjoint non-empty sets.\n\nIt is immediate to see that Burali-Forti\u2019s antinomy cannot be\nderived in Zermelo\u2019s system, since the collection of all order\ntypes does not exist as a set, and Russell\u2019s paradox simply\nbecomes the theorem that there does not exist a universal set.\n\nHowever, one could raise at least two objections against the theory on\ndifferent grounds. First of all, Zermelo\u2019s approach is actually\nhighly impredicative and impredicativity was regarded as\nindispensable by him (else one would be forced to reject standard\nmathematics, e.g., Zermelo believed this was the case even with the\nCauchy-Weierstrass proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra). But\nimpredicativity makes the construction of a model or of an\ninterpretation more difficult and less evident. The second point is\nthat Zermelo believed that the paradox of finite denotation (mentioned\nby Hessenberg) and Richard\u2019s are blocked in set theory, as the\nseparation axiom ought to yield clear criteria for defining sets. But\nthis is not the case, because Zermelo\u2019s notion of definite\nproperty (definite Eigenschaft) is given informally and is\nultimately vague.\n\nThe latter issue was taken up in Weyl\u2019s\n\u201cHabilitation\u201d lecture (1910), where he addressed the\ngeneral question: when is a relation explicitly definable from a set\nof given primitive concepts in mathematics? First of all, he\nconsiders, as a concrete case study, the problem of characterizing the\nexplicitly definable concepts of elementary plane geometry: these can\nbe inductively generated by means of five basic definition principles\nfrom two suitably chosen primitive concepts (e.g., the identity\nbetween points =, and the ternary relation \\(E(a, b, c)\\), \u2018the\ndistance of point \\(a\\) from point \\(b\\) is the same as the distance\nof point \\(a\\) from point \\(c\\)\u2019).\n\nThe five definition principles correspond to a finite\naxiomatization of the elementary comprehension principle, and\nthey imply the existence of exactly those sets (relations), which are\ndefinable by formulas in the elementary language comprising two\npredicate symbols for \\(=, E\\). More explicitly, one requires closure\nunder the logical operations of negation, conjunction, existential\nquantification and suitable combinatorial operations of permutation\nand expansion.\n\nIn the light of the geometric example, Weyl attacks the concept\n\u201cdefined by means of finitely many words\u201d as not precise,\nand long before Fraenkel and Skolem, he succeeds in making the\nseparation principle precise: he simply replaces Zermelo\u2019s\ninformal concept of definite property with the notion of\n\u2018relation explicitly definable from extensional equality and\nmembership by means of the basic elementary logical principles\u2019\n(we should simply say: first-order definable).\n\nAccording to Weyl, Richard\u2019s paradox teaches us the following\ndistinction: on the one hand, we are able to characterize only\ndenumerably many subsets of a given set by means of explicit\ndefinitions; but, on the other hand, new objects and (possibly\nuncountable) sets can be introduced by applying the remaining set\ntheoretic operations, like power set or union.\n\nWeyl addressed the problem of generating the admissible properties\nover a given domain a few years later in Das Kontinuum\n(1918). As in 1910, the set of sets of natural numbers that are\ndefinable via admissible operations (to which now also a form of\niteration is added) is denumerable. By Cantor\u2019s\nargument there is no relation which parametrizes all subsets of\nnatural numbers (Weyl 1918, section 5). Weyl apparently followed a\nrelativistic attitude, according to which the extension of the\nuniverse of sets and their properties depend on the operations which\nare accepted to construct sets (see also the entry\n Hermann Weyl).\n\nIt should be stressed that Weyl\u2019s attitude towards\nGrelling\u2019s antinomy is utterly negative: he considers it pure\nScholasticism (Weyl 1918, section 1): there is no way, according to\nhim, of assigning a meaning to \u2018heterological\u2019 and one\nshould ultimately resolve these problems by appealing to\nphilosophy.\n\nIt is interesting to observe that, in the light of recent\ndevelopments, Weyl\u2019s negative verdict ought to be weakened (see\nsection 6).\n",
