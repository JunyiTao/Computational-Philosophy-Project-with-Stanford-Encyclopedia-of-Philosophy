    "main_text": "The Physical Principles || Mixture and Rotation\n3.1 Mixture and Rotation\n\n\nThe original state of the cosmos was an unlimited (apeiron)\nmixture of all the ingredients. The mixture of ingredients, all\nwith all, exists eternally. Up to some point in the past, it was\nmotionless (59 B1, A45), and it was everywhere undifferentiated, or\nalmost so. According to B1, which Simplicius, the source for the\nfragment, says was near the beginning of Anaxagoras\u2019 book:\n\n\nAll things were together, unlimited both in amount and in\nsmallness, for the small, too, was unlimited. And because all\nthings were together, nothing was evident on account of smallness; for\nair and aether covered all things, both being unlimited, for these are\nthe greatest among all things both in amount and in largeness.\n\n\nThis undifferentiated mass includes all there is of all the natural\ningredients that there are, the ingredients that will eventually form\nthe natural constructs that constitute the cosmos as we know it.\nNothing is ever added to or subtracted from this storehouse of stuffs,\nalthough the mass of stuffs is not always homogeneous. In fact,\nthere are different densities of ingredients even at this earliest\n(pre-motion) stage. B1 makes clear that air (dark, moist stuff)\nand aether (bright fiery stuff) are the most emergent (largest)\ningredients, and their dominance means that the original mixture must\nhave been like a dense bright cloud: nothing else would be evident or\nmanifest, even had there been an observer. At some point\nnous (the time being right) set the mixture in motion and\ncaused it to begin to revolve (first in a small area, and then in an\never-widening area). The rotary motion causes the ingredients in\nthe mass to shift. This shifting produces what Anaxagoras calls\n\u201cseparating off.\u201d Because the mass is a plenum, any\nseparation will be a rearrangement (thus a mixing) of\ningredients. The continouous ever-expanding rotation produces more and\nmore separation. The Everything-in-Everything principle continues\nto hold, so there are all ingredients at all places at all times, but\nthe different densities of ingredients allow for local variations, and\nso the rotating mass becomes qualitatively differentiated.\n",
