    "main_text": "The Enlightenment Philosophes\n5. Painting: of Amateurs and Professionals\n\nAs debates about taste in literature and music were taking place,\nother debates arose in the world of visual arts. Artists felt a new\nauthority to theorize publicly about their work, even though in 1719\nDubos still referred to them as \u201cartisans\u201d, harking back\nto an era in which artists had no more prestige than other skilled\nmanual laborers. However, Louis XIV had established the Royal Academy\nof Painting and Sculpture in 1648 and thus gave these former artisans\na special status. He named Charles Le Brun, who occupied the role of\nFirst Painter to the King, as the founding director of this Academy.\nIts leaders created a set of apprenticeships and tests that the\naspirants had to pass in order to be formally accepted. Painters,\ndepending on how they wished to be received, could present a master\nwork in the \u201cgrand genre\u201d: that is, a historic,\nmythological, or religious scene. Otherwise, they could undertake some\nof the minor genres, which were, in descending hierarchical order,\nportraits, landscapes, \u201cgenre\u201d scenes that represented\ndaily life, and lastly, still lifes.\n\nOne major querelle occurred in the seventeenth century\nbetween proponents of line and those of color, or between the\nPoussinists and Rubenists. For a long time, color had been\ndisregarded, for at least three reasons: it is, in Charles Le\nBrun\u2019s words, \u201cbut an accident produced by the reflection\nof light and that varies according to circumstances\u201d (1672 [AT:\n183]); it appeals to sensuality whereas \u201cwe must not judge by\nour senses alone but by reason\u201d as Poussin puts it in a letter\nto Chantelou dated 24 November 1647 (AT: 69); and it proves unable to\nserve as a foundation for painting, unlike drawing, which is related\nto the mind (the original sense of disegno = drawing or\ndesign).\n\nThe painter Gabriel Blanchard cautiously started to endorse the use of\ncolor in the Academy in 1671. He did not want to \u201cdiminish the\nimportance of design\u201d but to\n\n\nestablish three things in defense of color: first, that color is just\nas necessary to the art of painting as design; secondly, that if we\ndiminish the worth of color, we thereby also diminish the worth of\npainters; and thirdly, that color merited the praise of the Ancients,\nand that it merits it again in our own age. (1671 [AT:\n178\u2013179])\n\n\nDesign is a necessary foundation, certainly, but if the aim of the\npainter is \u201cboth to deceive the eyes and to imitate\nnature\u201d, it is reasonable to conclude that color serves that\ngoal best, because \u201cherein lies the difference that\ndistinguishes painting from all the other arts and which gives\npainting its own specific end\u201d (AT: 180). This was clearly an\nattempt to turn to his advantage Poussin\u2019s phrase that the aim\nof painting is delectation\u2014but insufficient indeed to convince\nLe Brun.\n\nTwo men were going to play a special role in the color crusade. It may\nseem odd to mention royal historiographer Andr\u00e9 F\u00e9libien\nfirst because he is generally and rightly considered as a supporter of\nPoussin. But he was also liberal-minded, respectful of differing\nopinions (it was to cost him his position!) and anxious to find a fair\nbalance between the gifts of the mind and the talents of the hand. For\nhim, \u201cbeauty is a result of the proportion and symmetry between\ncorporeal and material parts\u201d (1725 [AT: 220]), so that color\ncannot be discarded since\n\n\neverything should appear so artfully connected that the whole painting\nseems to have been painted at one and the same time, and, as it were,\nfrom the same palette. (1725 [AT: 568], quoted by Louis-Guillaume\nBaillet de Saint-Julien, 1748, Lettre sur la peinture, sculpture\net architecture, Avec un examen des principaux Ouvrages expos\u00e9s\nau Louvre au mois d\u2019Ao\u00fbt, Paris: [n.p.])\n\n\nWhen he translates Du Fresnoy\u2019s De Arte Graphica (1668)\nand publishes his Dialogue upon Coloring (1673), art critic\nRoger de Piles may appear to hold stronger views; however, by\ntransferring emphasis from color to coloring, he too stresses the\nimportance of harmony and the way it presupposes mastery of local\ncolor and chiaroscuro. When de Piles entered the Academy\nthree decades later, he would produce a synthesis under the title\nPrinciples of Painting (1708), in which he insists that\n\n\ntrue painting is such as not only surprises, but as it were, calls to\nus; and has so powerful an effect, that we cannot help coming near it,\nas if it had something to tell us. (1708 [AT: 309])\n\n\nIn a word,\n\n\nthe spectator is not obliged to seek for truth in a painting;\nbut truth, by its effect, must call to the\nspectator, and force his attention. (1708 [AT: 310])\n\n\nThat points to what he called \u201cthe whole together\u201d, that\nis \u201ca general subordination of objects one to another, as makes\nthem all concur to constitute but one\u201d, for the utmost\nsatisfaction of the eye (1708 [AT: 312]). The same lesson can be drawn\nfrom Antoine Coypel\u2019s writings, where \u201cthe excellence of\npainting\u201d is no longer separate from \u201cthe aesthetic of the\npainter\u201d. His nomination as Academy\u2019s Director in 1714 was\nthe sign that a page had been turned.\n\nAfter Louis XIV, patronage of the arts was heavily influenced by the\nstylistic preferences of Louis XV\u2019s official mistress the\nMarquise de Pompadour, who selected the artists and architects who\nwould receive royal pensions, commissioned works that defined the\nlegacy of this era, and sponsored the porcelain works of\nS\u00e8vres. She also introduced her brother, later ennobled as the\nMarquis de Marigny, to the court; she arranged for the painter Antoine\nCoypel and the architect Jacques-Germain Soufflot (later responsible\nfor the Pantheon in Paris) to undertake his education. Wielding her\npolitical influence, she then had Marigny named Director General of\nthe King\u2019s Buildings, which made him an important decision-maker\nin giving royal commissions to artists.\n\nAside from royal patronage, there were also roles for the\n\u201camateurs\u201d or \u201cconnoisseurs\u201d, individuals who\nplayed an increasingly important role in shaping the arts during the\nAncien R\u00e9gime. In the words of art historian Charlotte\nGuichard,\n\n\nThe amateur constituted an intermediate figure between the\npatron, characteristic of court society in early modern times, and the\ncollector, who emerged as the art market developed. (Guichard 2012:\n521)\n\n\nAmong the most famous of these connoisseurs were the financier Pierre\nCrozat and the Comte de Caylus. It was not enough for them to collect\nthousands of works; they were also involved with indexing and\nreproducing them through printmaking. The Recueil Crozat\n(1729 and 1742) is the true ancestor of art books and dictionaries\ndevoted to fine arts, which began to multiply (see, e.g.,\nPern\u00e9ty\u2019s Dictionnaire portatif [1757], Watelet\nand L\u00e9vesque\u2019s Dictionnaire des arts [1792], and\nespecially Mariette\u2019s Abecedario, posthumously\npublished from 1851\u20131860). Catalogs began to proliferate and the\nfirst monographs appeared, among the most important being Recueil\nJulienne, Jean de Julienne\u2019s collection of 271 engravings\nafter Watteau\u2019s paintings. Caylus and Dezallier\nd\u2019Argenville also wrote about artists, sketched biographies and\nestablished rules for discerning the delicacy of style or the\nlightness of execution. All this took place in the larger context in\nwhich the cosmopolitan amateurs of different countries were able to\neasily travel abroad. (Such travels evolved into the ritual of the\nGrand Tour.)\n\nIn an era before formal museums existed, the public had little access\nto art, until the Royal Academy began displaying paintings in what is\nknown as the Salon in 1737. The Salon began as a political and social\nevent that was inaugurated in the Louvre\u2019s Salon Carr\u00e9 on\n25 August\u2014St. Louis\u2019 day\u2014to pay homage to the king\nand it was to last one month. Over the years, it became a valuable\nguide for tracing the major trends in style and aesthetic ideas, for\nlists of works as well as evolutionary trends in pictorial genres were\ntaken into account. But the most significant consequence of the rise\nof the Salon was the birth of a new literary genre, namely, the salon\nreview, which flourished until the twentieth century and has been an\nincomparable mirror of aesthetic thought. Originally, such reviews\nwere just a blend of descriptive reports and theoretical asides, often\ncontroversial. The \u201csalon\u201d is for the benefit of a larger\npublic\u2014that is, those not necessarily affiliated with some\nartistic institution. As La Font de Saint-Yenne wrote in 1747:\n\n\nan exhibited picture is the same as a book on the day of publication,\nand as a play performed in the theater: everyone has the right to make\nhis own judgment. We have gathered together the judgments of the\npublic which showed the greatest amount of agreement and fairness, and\nwe now present them, and not at all our own judgment, to the\nartists, in the belief that this same public [whose] judgments are so\noften bizarre and unjustly damning or hasty rarely errs when all its\nvoices unite on the merit or weakness of any particular work. (1747\n[AT: 555])\n\n\nWith Caylus, Baillet de Saint-Julien, and then above all Diderot, the\naesthetic importance of painting is increasingly emphasized, opening\nthe way to a long tradition of writers keen on painting.\n\nDiderot\u2019s efforts as an art writer were based on two\ncomplementary beliefs, namely, that the techniques used by a painter\nto produce various effects are difficult for the ordinary viewer to\nunderstand and articulate, and that it is a difficult but vital\nchallenge to capture, through literary language, the significant\naspects of a painting. That the painter\u2019s alchemy eludes the\nviewer\u2019s understanding is something often repeated by Diderot,\nnotably with respect to Jean-Baptiste Chardin:\n\n\nIt\u2019s magic, one can\u2019t understand how it\u2019s done:\nthick layers of colour, applied one on top of the other, each one\nfiltering through from underneath to create the effect. At times, it\nlooks as though the canvas has misted over from someone breathing on\nit; at others, as though a thin film of water has landed on\nit\u2026. Close up, everything blurs, goes flat and disappears. From\na distance, everything comes back to life and reappears. (1763 [AT:\n604])\n\n\nAt the same time, Diderot is aware that the painter\u2019s power\nmakes it extremely hard for the writer to give his reader a deep grasp\nof a painting. Despite the difficulty, the writer must somehow express\nthe essence of a masterpiece, thereby achieving a kind of\nekphrasis, in which the art of writing attempts to capture in\nwords the essence and form of the visual art of painting. The critic\nmust not only provide the reader with a short description of the work\nin question, but must attempt to make his words somehow equivalent to\nthe sentiment expressed by the painting in question.\n\nAside from the exceptional painters that Diderot admired, such as\nGreuze and Chardin, the eighteenth century saw a rivalry between two\npredominant styles, rococo and neoclassicism. Rococo artists such as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher tended to depict scenes of flirtation in rich\ninteriors or pastoral settings, which detractors scorned as\neffeminate. Rococo artists sometimes chose mythological subjects and\nneoclassical painters did as well, but the latter inserted overtly\ndidactic messages. Philosophers such as Diderot praised this latter\nstyle because they claimed it would instill more of a virile sense of\npatriotism among the populace. One could see the works of\nJacques-Louis David, during the Revolution, as the ultimate conflation\nof classical subjects, images of traditionally manly virtue, and\nmessages of national pride. French interest in Antiquity had been\nconstant throughout the Ancien R\u00e9gime, but it was further\nenriched by the dissemination of printed images of archaeological\nsites in Athens, Pompeii, and other cities in which new discoveries\nhad been made.\n\nThe end of the eighteenth century saw the birth of the museum.\nPreviously, people could see works of art only in private homes or in\nreligious institutions, even though during this period, certain\ncollectors began making their \u201ccabinets of curiosities\u201d\navailable to the public. The British Museum had opened in 1759 and the\nUffizi in 1765, but France was behind its neighbors, even if royal\ncollections were more accessible than before. The first suggestion for\ncreating a gallery in the unoccupied Louvre goes back to 1747 and was\nreiterated in 1765 in the eponymous entry in the\nEncyclop\u00e9die (Jaucourt 1765). The Louvre museum\nfinally opened in 1793.\n\nThe new accessibility of art to the masses, as well as the increasing\nliteracy and proliferation of printed works, transformed society in\nthe eighteenth century. The worldly judges of taste in the seventeenth\ncentury gave way to the professional critics, i.e. the Enlightenment\nphilosophes. The new world created by the French Revolution\nwould soon expand\u2014and further complicate\u2014the connection\nbetween the production of art and its reception by both critics and\nthe public.\n",
