    "main_text": "Scope of Skeptical Theism || Divine Hiddenness\n8. Theory Development\n\nTheism is a cornerstone of many major religious traditions. But it is\nalso a metaphysical view, being an ontological claim about what\nexists. It is also one potential way of filling in a\n\u201csupernatural\u201d worldview on which the world is not\nexhausted by \u201cnatural\u201d things but also contains\n\u201csupernatural\u201d things. Many philosophers evaluate\nmetaphysical claims in a manner similar to scientific claims, such as\ntheir ability to explain phenomenon, be well-confirmed, exhibit\ntheoretical virtues (such as simplicity), etc.\n\nHowever, there is a well-known lesson in scientific theorizing about\nhow not to avoid a theoretical problem. Suppose we are\nevaluating a hypothesis H (say, Mars revolves around the\nEarth). But there is some data D that seems to strongly\ndisconfirm H (say, Mars exhibits \u201cretrograde\nmotion\u201d). One could expand or enrich\nH by adding further hypotheses to H that would predict the\ndata D (say, Mars orbits the earth using epicycles on an\norbit). The resulting expanded or enriched hypothesis may perfectly\nwell predict the data D. But if the resulting expanded or\nenriched hypothesis is random, unprincipled, independently\nimplausible, or otherwise ad hoc, it may not be plausible to\nbelieve the expanded hypothesis in virtue of these additions or\nexpansions. The lesson here\u2014crudely put\u2014is that one should\nnot respond to a problem for a hypothesis by just\nadding claims to that hypothesis. At the very least, one should also\nexplain why those additional claims are also expectable given the\nhypothesis in question. In that way, one can show that the additional\nclaims are not random, unprincipled, or ad hoc.\n\nAmong other things, theism is a metaphysical hypothesis. Many authors\nhave argued that various facts about good and evil are strong evidence\nthat disconfirms this hypothesis. In response, some authors have\nadduced skeptical theistic critiques, composed of further claims about\nGod and human limitations. However, the lesson from above is that\nsimply adding further claims is insufficient to defend a\nhypothesis from a theoretical problem. Thus, if these skeptical\ntheistic claims are random, ad hoc, or unprincipled when\nadded to theism, then even if the expanded theism adequately\nneutralizes the disconfirming evidence, the expanded theism may be too\nimplausible to be reasonably believed.\n\nThough not always framed in this way, skeptical theists have been\nsensitive to these points. Some skeptical theists argue that their\nskeptical theistic claims are independently plausible\u2014that is,\nplausible independent of whether or not theism is true. Other\nskeptical theists argue that their skeptical theistic claims are quite\nplausible given theism. Skeptical theists offer various\ndefenses, by appealing to considerations of human limitations or moral\nprogress or ruminations about historical complexity or analogies\ninvolving expertise in various fields (see, inter alia,\nAlston 1996: 317ff; Howard-Snyder 1996b: 301ff; Durston 2000; Bergmann\n2001: 284\u20136; Perrine 2019: 124\u2013126; Hendricks 2020).\nEither way, these arguments can be used to try to show that skeptical\ntheistic claims are not random, ad hoc, or unprincipled ways\nof \u201cexpanding\u201d or adding to theism.\n\nThe issue of how to develop a theory was incipient in some of the\nexchanges between Rowe and Wykstra (see Rowe 1986: 246\u20137; Rowe\n2006: 85ff; Wykstra 1984: 91ff; 1996: 142\u20135; Russell and Wykstra\n1988: 159\u2013160; Wykstra 1996: 140ff). For instance, Rowe concedes\nthat certain claims are entirely expectable given theism, such as:\nthere might be goods and evils beyond our ken but not beyond\nGod\u2019s. But other claims are not expectable given theism, such\nas: there is suffering that is necessary for goods beyond our ken\nand God would not tell us this. Rowe defends these claims by\nappeal to Wykstra\u2019s parent-child analogy. A parent may allow a\nchild to undergo a painful surgery for reasons that the child cannot\nyet understand; but a loving parent will surely not be absent\nwhile the child suffers (see also Dougherty 2012, Rutledge 2017b).\nWykstra argued that such claims are expectable given theism\nby means of his analogy with scientific depth. More recently, other\nauthors have tried to give other reasons why, even given theism, we\nshould expect seemingly unjustified suffering without divine\ncomfort or acknowledgement of that suffering (see DePoe 2014, 2017;\nShields 2021)). These disputes can be understood as disputes over\nwhether theism can be \u201cexpanded\u201d by skeptical theistic\nconsiderations in a way that is both plausible and undermines\narguments from evil, or whether the only plausible and principled ways\nof expanding theism do not undermine such arguments (compare Perrine\nand Wykstra 2014, 2017: 104\u20137).\n\nThe issue of theory development is important for two further reasons.\nFirst, many skeptical theists defend their claims and critiques by\narguing that critics misunderstand them or that their positions are\nanalogous to other cases that are perfectly unproblematic. However, as\nphilosophers of science like Kuhn and Lakatos have suggested, many of\nour best scientific theories offer recommendations (implicitly or\nexplicitly) for how to develop or expand hypotheses.\nSkeptical theists have spent less time making positive proposals for\nhow to develop or expand a theistic worldview. Unless they do so, some\ncritics may worry that skeptical theism makes theism into a\n\u201cdegenerating research program\u201d (to use Lakatos\u2019\ncharming phrase).\n\nSecond, many skeptical theists are not simply theists; they are\nadherents to some religious tradition. Religious traditions normally\nmake many more claims than (mere) theism, and religious traditions\nnormally reject other alternative religious traditions. Some\nphilosophers of religion\u2014such as Richard Swinburne\u2014have\ncontinued the project of natural theology to not only defend theism\nbut a specific religious tradition as well (Christianity, in\nSwinburne\u2019s case). But many\u2014including some skeptical\ntheists\u2014worry that such projects are undermined by skeptical\ntheistic considerations. If so, skeptical theists who are theists need\nto explore alternative routes for explaining the justification of\nreligious belief, such as reformed epistemology (see Plantinga and\nWolterstroff 1983; Plantinga 2000). At the very least, more work could\nbe done exploring positive models that incorporate justified belief in\nboth skeptical theism and specific religious traditions.\n",
