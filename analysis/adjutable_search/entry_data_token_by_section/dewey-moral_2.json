    "main_text": "Developmental and Social Psychology || Habit\n1.2 Habit\n\nHabits are socially shaped dispositions to particular forms of\nactivity or modes of response to the environment. They channel\nimpulses in specified directions, toward certain outcomes, by\nentrenching particular uses of means, prescribing certain conduct in\nparticular circumstances. While individuals may have idiosyncratic\nhabits, the most important habits are customs, shared habits of a\ngroup that are passed on to children through socialization. Customs\noriginate in purposive activity. Every society must devise means for\nthe satisfaction of basic human needs for food, shelter, clothing, and\naffiliation, for coping with interpersonal conflict within the group\nand treatment of outsiders, for dealing with critical events such as\nbirth, coming of age, and death. Customary ways of satisfying needs\nshape the direction of impulse in the socialized individual. A young\nchild just starting on solid food may be open to eating nearly\nanything. But every society limits what it counts as edible. Certain\nfoods become freighted with social meaning \u2014as suitable for\ncelebrating birthdays, good for serving to guests, reserved for\nsacrifice to the gods, or fit only for animals. The child\u2019s\nhunger becomes refined into a taste for certain foods on particular\noccasions. She may recoil in disgust or horror from certain edibles\ndeemed taboo or unclean. There may have been a rationale for the\noriginal selection of foods. Perhaps some food was deemed taboo when\nits consumption was followed by a natural disaster, and people\nconcluded that the gods were angry at them for consuming it. But the\nhabit of avoiding it may persist long after its original rationale is\nforgotten (E 39\u201348, HNC 15\u201321, 43\u20137).\n\nWhile habits incorporate purposes and socially meaningful ideas, they\noperate beneath the actor\u2019s consciousness. Once people have\nlearned how to achieve some purpose through habit or skill, they no\nlonger need to tend to what they are doing. Habits, by receding from\nawareness, conserve people\u2019s reflective resources, make their\nactivity fluid, and enable them to reliably produce results in stable\nenvironments. People\u2019s habits embody their characters (HNC\n33\u201343, 50\u20132).\n\nBecause they operate subconsciously, habits may continue after their\noriginal rationale has been forgotten or repudiated. Because they\nentrench modes of conduct rather than ends in view, they may produce\nunintended results when the environment changes. We can reliably\nproduce alternative results only by acquiring a new habit. Discovering\nthe means required to change habits requires psychological and\nsociological inquiry, not just conscientiousness and willpower. It is\nmagical thinking to suppose that we can change habits through\nconscious willing, when we lack knowledge of the means of change. Nor\ncan we check their operation through monitoring, since they operate\nbehind our backs. (HNC 21\u201332).\n\nHabits tend to be difficult to modify because people form emotional\nattachments to them, and prevailing ideologies represent current\ncustoms as right. Dewey placed his hopes for change in the education\nof youth. Because children have impulses not yet channeled into rigid\nhabits, they are better able to open up opportunities for change,\nprovided their education instills habits of independent thought,\ncritical inquiry, experimentation, and imagination, including sympathy\nwith others (DE; HNC 127\u20138). Such education can make habits\nthemselves more intelligent \u2014 flexible and responsive to\nchange.\n",
