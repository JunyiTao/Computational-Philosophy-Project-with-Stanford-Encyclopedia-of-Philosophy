    "main_text": "Pyrrhonian Skepticism || Rejecting Premise 7: Positism\n5.5 Rejecting More than One Premise\n\nPerhaps the most interesting recent development in relation to\nPyrrhonian Skepticism is that more and more epistemologists are\narguing that the proper way to reply to Agrippa\u2019s trilemma is to\ncombine some of the positions that, for ease of exposition, we have\npresented as mutually exclusive. Thus, for example, many contemporary\nepistemologists put forward theories that contain elements of both\nFoundationalism and Coherentism (see, for instance, Haack 1993). It is\na testament to the endurance of Pyrrhonian Skepticism that\nphilosophers continue in this way to grapple with it.\n",
