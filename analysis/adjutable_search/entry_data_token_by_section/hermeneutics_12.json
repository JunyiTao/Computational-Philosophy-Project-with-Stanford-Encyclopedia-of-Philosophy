    "main_text": "Contemporary Hermeneutics || Humanism and Art\n4.1 Humanism and Art\n\nThe point de d\u00e9part for Gadamer\u2019s philosophical\nhermeneutics is the concern that the success of the scientific method\nhas alienated us from the validity of the truth at issue in\ninterpretive experience. Philosophical hermeneutics therefore begins\nwith an attempt to recover the sense of truth at issue in interpretive\nexperience by focusing our attention on motifs from the tradition of\nhumanism and on the ontology of art. Gadamer\u2019s considerations of\nmotifs from the tradition of humanism are oriented by Weimar\nclassicism and its legacy in nineteenth-century German intellectual\nlife. His account helps us to recover the validity of an experience of\ntruth that is not measured by scientific method but that, instead,\ndepends on our education, grasped as formation (Bildung)\nthrough formal education and experience, as well as the concordant\ncultivation of capacities, such as common sense\n(sensus communis), judgment, and taste (Gadamer,\nTruth and Method, Part I.1.B).\n\nGadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics upholds that the primary\nexample of the hermeneutical experience of truth is found in our\nencounters with art. Gadamer believes this becomes clear once we\novercome modern assumptions about the subjectivity of aesthetic\nexperience, in which the being of art is reduced to that of an\nimmediately present object that, in turn, has the property of\nproducing affects, such as aesthetic pleasure, in a subject. In his\nhermeneutics, by contrast, the being of art is rather a matter of a\nrealization or \u201cenactment\u201d (Vollzug) that we\nparticipate in (Gadamer, Truth and Method, 103). The\nexperience of an artwork unfolds as an event of interpretation that,\nwhen it is a success, allows us to recognize something that purports\nor claims to be true.\n\nIn Gadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics, the treatment of the\nexperience of art is expansive, but a synopsis of his definitive\nformulation from Truth and Method is instructive. Gadamer,\nfirst, introduces the theme of \u2018play,\u2019 or, of the\n\u2018game\u2019 (Spiel) to emphasize that the experience\nof art is an event of interpretation that exceeds the subjective\nintentions or interests of those involved in it (Gadamer, Truth\nand Method, Part I.II.1.A). Insofar as we agree to play a game,\nwe give ourselves over to the context of meaning that comprises the\ngame. We allow ourselves to be oriented by the norms that govern, and\nthus enable but never determine, thoughts and actions appropriate to\nthe playing of the game. Likewise, when we participate in an\nexperience of an artwork, we give ourselves over to the context of\nmeaning that comprises the work, and, thus, allow our interpretive\nexperience to be governed by the limits and possibilities of\ninterpretation appropriate to the work. When we experience a\nperformance of Athol Fugard, John Kani, and Winston Ntshona\u2019s\nThe Island, for example, we allow our interpretive experience\nto be governed by limits and possibilities of interpretation that have\nto do with apartheid-era South Africa, Robben Island Prison, and\nparallels with Sophocles\u2019 Antigone.\n\nGadamer maintains that in our experience of art, such play culminates\nin what he calls \u2018transformation into structure.\u2019 By this,\nhe means that our experience of art comes to be that of a work,\ngrasped in its \u2018ideality\u2019 or meaningfulness, in\ndistinction from the activities involved in its presentation (such as\nthe activity of actors presenting a drama). With our experience of\nsuch a \u2018transformation into structure,\u2019 the work of art\nallows us to recognize something as true (Gadamer, Truth and\nMethod, Part I.II.1.B). He describes this interpretive experience\nof truth as a process of mediation, by which a claim of truth at issue\nin an artwork comes into view through the repeated projection and\nsupersession of inadequate interpretations, until such mediation\nbecomes sufficient, or \u2018total.\u2019 There is, as anyone who\nhas experienced an artwork will confirm, no method to ensure the\nsuccess of this process of repeated projection and supersession; it\ndepends on the quality of our interpretive work, and, this quality can\nbe enlarged by our formation of our capacities such as common sense,\njudgment, and taste.\n",
