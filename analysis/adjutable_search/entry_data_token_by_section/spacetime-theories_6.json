    "main_text": "Einstein || The Relationist Roots of STR and GTR\n2.2 The Relationist Roots of STR and GTR\n\nThe simple comparison made above between STR and Newtonian physics in\nGalilean spacetime is somewhat deceptive. For one thing, Galilean\nspacetime is a mathematical innovation posterior to\nEinstein\u2019s 1905 theory; before then, Galilean spacetime had not\nbeen conceived, and full acceptance of Newtonian mechanics implied\naccepting absolute velocities and, arguably, absolute positions, just\nas laid down in the Scholium. So Einstein\u2019s elimination\nof absolute velocity was a genuine conceptual advance. Moreover, the\nScholium was not the only reason for supposing that there\nexisted a privileged reference frame of \u2018rest\u2019: the\nworking assumption of almost all physicists in the latter half of the\n19th century was that, in order to understand the wave theory of\nlight, one had to postulate an aetherial medium filling all space,\nwave-like disturbances in which constituted electromagnetic radiation.\nIt was assumed that the aether rest frame would be an inertial\nreference frame; and physicists felt some temptation to equate its\nframe with the absolute rest frame, though this was not necessary.\nRegardless of this equation of the aether with absolute space, it was\nassumed by all 19th century physicists that the equations of\nelectrodynamic theory would have to look different in a reference\nframe moving with respect to the aether than they did in the\naether\u2019s rest frame (where they presumably take their canonical\nform, i.e., Maxwell\u2019s equations and the Lorentz force law). So\nwhile theoreticians labored to find plausible transformation rules for\nthe electrodynamics of moving bodies, experimentalists tried to detect\nthe Earth\u2019s motion in the aether. Experiment and theory played\ncollaborative roles, with experimental results ruling out certain\ntheoretical moves and suggesting new ones, while theoretical advances\ncalled for new experimental tests for their confirmation or \u2013 as\nit happened \u2013 disconfirmation.\n\nAs is well known, attempts to detect the Earth\u2019s velocity in the\naether were unsuccessful. On the theory side, attempts to formulate\nthe transformation laws for electrodynamics in moving frames \u2013\nin such a way as to be compatible with experimental results \u2013\nwere complicated and\n inelegant.[6]\n A simplified way of seeing how Einstein swept away a host of problems\nat a stroke is this: he proposed that the Galilean principle of\nrelativity holds for Maxwell\u2019s theory, not just for mechanics.\nThe canonical (\u2018rest-frame\u2019) form of Maxwell\u2019s\nequations should be their form in any inertial reference\nframe. Since the Maxwell equations dictate the velocity c of\nelectromagnetic radiation (light), this entails that any inertial\nobserver, no matter how fast she is moving, will measure the velocity\nof a light ray as c \u2013 no matter what the relative\nvelocity of its emitter may be. Einstein worked out logically the\nconsequences of this application of the special relativity principle,\nand discovered that space and time must be rather different from how\nNewton described them. STR undermined Newton\u2019s absolute time\njust as decisively as it undermined his absolute space.\n",
