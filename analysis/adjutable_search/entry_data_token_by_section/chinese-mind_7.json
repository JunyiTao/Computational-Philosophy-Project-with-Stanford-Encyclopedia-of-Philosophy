    "main_text": "Normative conceptions of the person || The Mengzi\n2.4 The Mengzi\n\nThe Mengzi (unless otherwise indicated, all references to the\nChinese text will be to Mengzi in CTP) carries forward the\nidea that heart-mind should lead or command bodily qi (2A2).\nIn 6A15, he distinguishes the part of the person that is great from\nthe part that is small. Those who follow the great part become great\npersons and those who follow the small part become small persons. In\n6A14, nourishing the small part is associated with being given to\neating and drinking. This fits with the 6A15 association of the small\npart with faculties of hearing and sight that do not think and are led\nby things perceived through these senses. By contrast the faculty of\nthe heart-mind is to think, and it is the performance of this faculty\nthat is associated with establishing the greater part of ourselves.\nThis conception of the heart-mind as leader seems to overlap with the\ncontemporary conception of the executive functions of the mind:\nperception of patterns of similarity and difference in the world,\nresponding to these patterns through reasoning and feeling, setting\naims, and initiating action to achieve those aims.\n\nMengzi\u2019s conception of the heart-mind is holistic,\ni.e., it\u2019s guiding blends the heart-mind\u2019s thinking,\nemoting, desiring, and conating. The human heart-mind begins with\ninnate duan \u7aef, seeds or sprouts of goodness. Mencius\nattributes these to Tian\u2019s implanting them in human\nnature (ren xing \u4eba\u6027). These inborn\nduan are dispositions to feelings or emotions (qing\n\u60c5) linked with the body. Cognition also has a duan\nwhich takes the form of intuitions of right and wrong\n(\u662f\u975e shi-fei). When the heart-mind develops from\nthese sprouts it both acts well and grows in the sense that it\nacquires new moral knowledge and motivation to perform better in other\nsituations. Reasoning and reflecting on emotions therefore involve the\nbody. Therefore, when Mengzi says that the function of the heart-mind\nis to lead the rest of the person, he is not thereby contrasting\nsomething that is purely mental or cognitive with another thing that\nis purely physical or affective. The leading part of the person is\nboth mental, physical, cognitive, and affective (see entry on\n the emotions in early Chinese philosophy).\n\nMengzi numbers the duan, calling them the four heart-minds.\nEach develops into a different dimension of ethical excellence:\nceyin zhixin \u60fb\u96b1\u4e4b\u5fc3 (compassion)\ncan develop into ren \u4ec1 (human-heartedness);\nxiuwu\u7f9e\u60e1 (shame and dislike) can develop into\nyi\u7fa9 (righteousness); ciran\u8fad\u8b93\n(deference and yielding) can develop into li \u79ae (ritual\npropriety, etiquette); and shi/fei \u662f\u975e can\ndevelop into zhi\u667a or wisdom.\n\nThe heart-mind links humans with Tian. In 6A16, Mengzi\ndistinguishes the nobility of Tian from the nobility of\nhumans. Human-heartedness, righteousness, loyalty, truthfulness, and\ntaking untiring pleasure in doing good is the nobility of\nTian. Being a duke, minister, or high-ranking official is the\nnobility of humans. In 2A2, Mengzi states his \u201cunmoved\nheart-mind\u201d enables him to remain steady in the face of\ninevitably uncertain fortune in pursuit of the nobility of humans. He\nachieved this state, he explains, through cultivating his flood-like\nqi. He cultivates it through the formation of zhi\n(intent or aim; see also Analects 9.26), which\nrightly leads and nourishes the body\u2019s qi. If\nnourished uprightly, it fills the space between Tian and\nearth. The suggestion here is that Tian\u2019s goodness,\nimplanted in human nature, runs throughout the material world. Humans\nwho cultivate their goodness merge with that larger universal\ngoodness. This brief metaphysically pregnant passage that links the\nheart-mind to attunement with the entire world comes to blossom in\nNeo-Confucian metaphysics (see entries on\n metaphysics in Chinese philosophy,\n Song-Ming Confucianism,\n Zhu Xi,\n and\n Wang Yangming).\n\nMengzi focuses most on compassion and its development into\nhuman-heartedness, the first duan. Of the four duan,\nshi/fei and its development into wisdom bears most directly\non the way that the heart-mind\u2019s reflection and reasoning foster\ngrowth of the sprout of compassion into human-heartedness and of the\nother two sprouts into their corresponding virtues. Accordingly, the\ndiscussion here will focus on the compassion/human-heartedness and\nshi/fei/wisdom. However, there is a growing body of\nliterature on the Confucian view of shame and a sense of shame as\nplaying important roles in the development of moral character,\ncontrary to some prominent views in the Western literature that shame\nis seldom, if ever, a productive moral emotion (see Van Norden 2002\n[2004]; Seok 2017; Tiwald 2017; and Hu 2022) for examples of\ndiscussion along these lines.\n\nMencius illustrates compassion with his story of the alarm, distress\nand compassion that anyone would feel upon seeing a child about to\nfall into a well (2A6). Clearly it starts with a cognitive\nrecognition of another as about to suffer. Alarm and distress are the\nnatural qing (emotion) in the situation and the compassion\nimplicit in that natural affection. In 2A6, Mengzi describes it as the\nheart that is unable to bear or endure [the suffering of] others. The\nqing also is an impulse to action\u2014to prevent or\nalleviate suffering. The impulse to action is the impulse to identify\nwhat should be done; thinking in conjunction with empirical knowledge\nof the world is required. Developing human-heartedness requires\nlearning to act on the emotion in the right way. In this, the sprout\nof shi/fei and its corresponding virtue of wisdom come into\nplay.\n\nMengzi does not engage in much explicit discussion of\nshi/fei, but the way that shi and fei are\nused in the text provide clues. Shi is often used to identify\n(\u201cthis\u201d) or to compare actions, events, or qualities of\npersons under certain categories (lei\u985e), and\nfei is used to exclude them (\u201cnot this\u201d) from\ncertain other categories. In 1A3, Mengzi explains to King Hui why\npeople are not flocking to his state despite the King\u2019s\nperception that he is more human-hearted toward his people than\nneighboring kings are to their peoples. Compare, he asks the king, a\nsoldier who throws down his weapon and flees from the enemy for one\nhundred paces to one who flees for fifty paces. Is not the second\nstill fleeing? The King agrees by saying that \u201cthis\u201d is\nalso fleeing. Mengzi then points out that the King lets dogs and swine\neat food meant for human beings while his people die of famine. The\nimplication is that the king\u2019s policies still fall far short of\nbeing human-hearted, even if metaphorically they go fifty paces less\nin the wrong direction. If the King attempts to excuse himself by\nsaying that it has simply been a bad year, Mengzi asks, \u201cHow is\n\u2018this\u2019 different from killing a person by stabbing him and\nthen saying, \u2018It was not I; it was the weapon\u2019?\u201d\nHere shi as \u201cthis\u201d is used to liken the\nking\u2019s inadequate efforts to save his people to the soldiers who\nstop at fifty paces and to a killer who blames the knife instead of\nhimself.\n\nMencius here draws on the analogical reasoning employed by the Mohists\ntalk of shi/fei as right/wrong. In another example, 2B3,\nMengzi is asked why he declined to accept money from King Xuan on one\noccasion and accepted on two subsequent occasions. Mengzi points to\nwhat he claims are relevant differences in the circumstances.\nDeclining was shi in the first case but it could be\nfei on subsequent occasions. Shi/fei is used in such\ncontexts to exemplify the relevance of wisdom to ethical excellence.\nThe fourth duan involves inborn dispositions to perceive or\njudge patterns of similarities and differences that play crucial roles\nin the cognitive aspects of the other duan, in recognizing\nmoral relevance. The duan develop into full moral virtues\nwith the growing guidance of the cognitive moral intuition.\nThe intuition identifies who is suffering and which acts are shameful,\nand which are not.\n\nAnalogical reasoning is pervasive in the Mengzi. In the most\ngeneral sense, analogical reasoning infers a conclusion in a\nproblematic case on the basis of that case\u2019s relevant\nsimilarities with another case in which the conclusion is regarded as\ncorrect. Has the King done enough for his starving people? Not if what\nhe has done is like the soldiers who stop fleeing from battle at 50\npaces. Is it the King\u2019s fault that the year\u2019s harvest has\nbeen a bad one? Yes, it is still his fault if his failure to prevent\nor make up for the bad harvest is like the killer who blames the knife\nand not himself. However, as the example in 2B3 illustrates, an\nanalogical inference may be defeated if a morally relevant\ndissimilarity is pointed out (see Lau 1970; Wong 2002).\n\nWhen the dispositions to deploy shi/fei develop into\nabilities to reliably discern patterns of a morally relevant sort,\nthey grow to constitute zhi as wisdom. Wisdom is implicitly\nethical. In 4A27, authentic wisdom is identified as knowing the most\nauthentic expression of ren (human-heartedness) as serving\none\u2019s parents and the most authentic expression of yi\n(righteousness) as following one\u2019s elder brothers. In 2A7 Mengzi\nsays that no one can cause us not to be ren\u2014failure in\nthis derives from a lack of wisdom. In 7A46 Mengzi says that what is\nurgent for the wise is confronting what is fundamental. There is no\none whom those who are ren do not love, but what is\nfundamental is earnestly caring for the worthy. Mengzi does\nnot make explicit what the meaning of \u201cmost fundamental\u201d\nis, but one possibility is that it is to be given priority in the\norder of development. One begins with concentrating most of\none\u2019s efforts to what is most fundamental and extends it to what\nis less fundamental.\n\nWisdom includes weighing conflicting values and judging correctly\nwhich takes precedence. In 4A17, when challenged by an example where\nthe situation seems to call for a violation of li (ritual\npropriety) by taking the hand of one\u2019s sister-in-law to save her\nfrom drowning, Mengzi replies that only a wolf would not save her.\nMengzi is then asked why he does not save the whole world when it is\ndrowning, the implication being that he refuses to sweep aside the\nniceties of ritual propriety to do what is necessary. He answers that\nit is a matter of discretion (quan \u6b0a) to determine\nthat saving one\u2019s sister-in-law takes precedence over ritual\npropriety, but he wonders whether he is being asked to save the world\nby pulling it out with his hand. One saves the world through the way,\nthe Dao \u9053, and the implication is that saving the\nworld with the dao cannot involve simply sweeping aside\nritual propriety.\n\nCrucial for Mengzi, then, is how the duan develop\ninto full virtues. Since analogy is the central method of reasoning\nfeatured in the text, we may conclude it is a major way innate knowing\ngrows into moral knowledge. The initial knowledge is sprouts of inborn\nmoral intuition. We start, e.g., from knowing to serve parents and\nfollowing elder brothers and infer who else to serve and to follow in\ndeveloping ren and yi (4A27 and 7A46).\n\nHowever, the central example in 2A6 of the operation of compassion is\none\u2019s emotional response to an endangered child who is neither\nin one\u2019s family nor known. But even if human beings are\nnaturally disposed to spontaneously care for their family members and\nfor innocent children who are not their own, they may not be disposed\nto spontaneously care for an irascible villager or for a stranger\nthey\u2019ve never met. To know that we have a reason to care for\nthese others, we must see the relevant moral similarities between them\nand the family member or child we do spontaneously care for. We infer\nwhat we have reason to do from cases in which we are confident that we\nknow what to do. These base cases for further inference by analogy are\nsupplied by intuitions from the duan.\n\nStill, such inferences are not valid if there are relevant moral\ndissimilarities between the base cases and the problematic cases at\nhand. This is an implication of 4A17, discussed above with reference\nto quan. Though one may not accord with the ritual of men and\nwomen not touching one another to save a drowning sister-in-law, one\nhas to save the drowning world through the Dao, and part of\nfollowing the Dao is to restore ritual propriety.\nMengzi\u2019s horizontal reasoning coming from comparing particular\ncases stands in significant contrast with vertical, top-down reasoning\nfrom general principles. It holds superior appeal if one thinks that\none\u2019s moral intuitions are more solid when rooted in the\nparticular, and it allows for building up to general principles\nthrough noting recurrent patterns of similarities and dissimilarities\n(Wong 2002). In 1A3, as seen above, Mengzi uses analogies to get King\nHui to see that he has to do more to keep his people from\nstarving.\n\nSince the duan include emotions, however, growth of the\nsprouts also depends on growth or maturation of the sprouts of\nemotion. Mengzi attempts to foster that maturation in King Xuan in\n1A7. King Xuan asks whether he has the capacity to be the kind of true\nking Mengzi has been urging him to be. Mengzi prompts the king to\nremember a time he spared an ox being led to ritual slaughter. The\nKing, moved by seeing the oxen\u2019s eyes, decides to spare the ox.\nBut he is uncertain about what his motivation was since, when asked\nwhether the ritual should be canceled, he orders a sheep to take the\nox\u2019s place. He is aware that his people surmise that he was\nbeing cheap (a sheep not being as costly).\n\nMengzi expresses understanding as to why sparing the ox but sending a\nsheep to be slaughtered confused the King, and his people, about his\nmotivation. However, he asserts that the King was rather moved by\ncompassion for the ox, and the King not only remembers being moved by\nthe ox\u2019s trembling in fear but also experiences the feeling of\ncompassion in his conversation with Mengzi. The King is prompted by\nMengzi\u2019s interpretation of his motivation to reflect back on the\nincident and recalls likening the ox to an innocent person being led\nto the execution ground. One implication of this very rich and complex\npassage is that Mengzi seems to be trying to spark the feeling of\ncompassion in the king and get that compassion to flow from the ox to\nhis people. That is why Mengzi immediately asks the King how his\nkindness could be sufficient to extend to animals but not to his\npeople. If it does not so extend, it is not because he is incapable,\nbut simply because he does not do it, thus implicitly answering the\nKing\u2019s original question of whether he could be a true king.\n\nNotice that Mengzi has again deployed an analogy here: from the\nox\u2019s suffering to the people\u2019s suffering and has appealed\nto the king\u2019s capability to respond to the ox to support the\ninference that he has the capability to care for his people. But what\nMengzi is most after is not the purely intellectual recognition that\nthe King has the capability. He has gotten the King to feel again the\ncompassion he felt with the ox, and by bringing up his people\u2019s\nplight, is trying to get the King\u2019s compassion to engage with\nhis people. That is, the most relevant analogy is from an emotion felt\nin one case to a hoped-for emotion in the second case. It is all the\nmore plausible because the King himself mediated his compassion for\nthe ox with the thought of an innocent person being led to execution.\nAnalogy plays a crucial role not only in extending intellectual assent\nbut also the affective motivation to act on that assent. Recognition\nof a reason to spare one\u2019s people suffering must be enlivened\nwith emotion to be motivationally effective.\n\nThere is more to be gleaned from this very rich and complex passage.\nIn his discussion with the King, Mengzi accepts the permissibility of\nsacrificing an animal for the performance of a ritual, but he also\naccepts that the King was right to spare the ox, having seen\nit\u2019s suffering. The underlying rationale may be that one\u2019s\nsensitivity to the suffering of animals is so close to one\u2019s\nsensitivity to the suffering of persons that it can be harmful to\nsquelch the former, even if the sacrifice would have been justified\nhad he not seen its suffering. The junzi \u541b\u5b50 or\n\u201cexemplary person\u201d (see Analects [1998]) cannot\nbear to see the suffering of animals, and so he stays away from the\nkitchen (there is disquieting silence here on the moral plight of\nthose in the kitchen; some people\u2019s moral sensitivities\napparently matter less than those of others). The constructive point\nto be taken here is that the sensitivity to other\u2019s suffering is\nsomething that must be both nurtured and protected. It cannot\nbe turned off simply because it is justifiable to kill the suffering\ncreature in question in one case. In other words, compassion as an\nemotional capacity has a course of development that is not malleable\nto being regulated by moral judgments that ignore the natural course\nof its development. In 1A7, Mengzi also mentions that deprivation of a\nconstant means of livelihood can entirely divert one\u2019s focus on\ndeveloping the sprouts to the urgent task of subsistence.\n\nThese views pertain to the kind of hierarchy Mengzi has in mind for\nthe relation between the heart-mind and the rest of the person. Recall\nthe close relation between emotions and the body. The heart-mind can\nseek to direct the flow of the qi of emotive attitudes, as\nMengzi attempts to coax King Xuan\u2019s compassion to flow from the\nox to his people, but the qi has natural tendencies that the\nheart-mind must respect. This point seems to be made in a more general\nway by the passage in 2A2 about the farmer from Song. The farmer was\nworried that his seedlings were not growing. He pulled on them,\nintending to help them grow, and his sons returned to the field to\nfind them all withered. There are few people, says Mengzi, who do not\ntry to help their seedlings to grow, but on the other hand there are\nsome who mistakenly believe that they can do no benefit to\ntheir seedlings and consequently neglect and do not weed among them.\nPerhaps the thought about the need to weed is connected to the thought\nin 6A15 that those who nurture the small part of the person become\nsmall persons. The weeds may be excessive desires for objects of the\nsenses, and weeding may be controlling these desires so that they do\nnot deprive the moral sprouts from nutrition. But further, it is\npossible to damage and even to kill the sprouts in trying to help them\ngrow. Underlying this implication is the belief that the inborn\nduan have a structure such that they grow in response to\ncertain kinds of treatment and wither in response to other kinds.\n\nMengzi\u2019s conception of the relation between the\nheart-mind\u2019s reflection and reasoning and its affective\ndispositions is not a simple hierarchical one. It is of an organic\nunity and mutual dependence. This conception presents a substantial\nand, in many respects, appealing alternative to Humean and Kantian\nconceptions of this relation. The heart-mind is not a slave to\nemotion, but neither does it act independently of emotion when it acts\nmorally (Wong 2017). Emotions go into the very composition of the\nduan of the heart-mind. Emotions have cognitive content\nembedded within them which shapes their intentional direction. For\nexample, the affective disposition identifies another\u2019s\npotential or actual suffering as a salient feature of the situation\nthat could constitute a reason and conative impetus for acting. On the\nother hand, the heart-mind\u2019s reflective and reasoning evaluation\nidentifies other relevant features of the situation as possible\nreasons that may augment or counteract suffering as a reason. For\nexample, in 1A7 (where King Xuan likens the ox\u2019s suffering to an\ninnocent person being led to the execution ground) and 3A5 (where\nMengzi associates the ancient kings\u2019 solicitous treatment of the\npeople as if they were innocent infants), Mengzi identifies a\nperson\u2019s innocence as relevant to having the compassionate\nresponse. This of course implies that the heart-mind might override an\nincipient compassionate response if the recipient is in some sense\ndeserving of suffering. Reflection, reasoning, and emotion are more\nlike partners in the human moral response to the world, rather than\none being dominant over the other, either descriptively or\nnormatively.\n",
