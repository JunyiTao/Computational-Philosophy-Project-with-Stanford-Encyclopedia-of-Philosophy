    "main_text": "Austinian topic situations\n3. Austinian topic situations\n\nA core feature of many actual analyses of natural language phenomena\nwithin situation semantics is the idea attributed to John L. Austin\n1950 that utterances are about particular situations, with the actual\nworld being the limiting case (see the entry on\n John Langshaw Austin.)\n Barwise & Etchemendy 1987 illustrate the idea with an imagined\nutterance of sentence (12):\n\n(12)\nClaire has the three of clubs.\n\n\nWhether an utterance of (12) is true or false depends, among other\nthings, on what situation the utterance is about.\n\nWe might imagine, for example, that there are two card games going on,\none across town from the other: Max is playing cards with Emily and\nSophie, and Claire is playing cards with Dana. Suppose someone\nwatching the former game mistakes Emily for Claire, and claims that\nClaire has the three of clubs. She would be wrong on the Austinian\naccount, even if Claire had the three of clubs across town. (Barwise\nand Etchemendy 1987, p. 122)\n\n\nIf assertions are about particular situations, reports of assertions\nmight not be accurate unless they take into account the situations the\nassertions were about. And there are more repercussions of Austinian\nreasoning: if assertions are about particular situations, beliefs\nshould be, too, and this means that our belief ascriptions might not\nbe accurate unless they take into account the situations the beliefs\nare about. That those situations do indeed matter for belief\nascriptions is illustrated by the story of the Butler and the Judge\nfrom Kratzer 1998 (see Ogihara 1996, Kratzer 1990 (Other Internet\nResources), 2002, 2012; Portner 1992, R\u00e9canati 2000, for\nrelevant work on the role of topic situations in attitude ascriptions\nand other embedded constructions):\n\nThe judge was in financial trouble. He told his butler that he had\nbeen ready to commit suicide, when a wealthy man, who chose to remain\nanonymous, offered to pay off his debts. The butler suspected that\nMilford was the man who saved his master\u2019s life by protecting\nhim from financial ruin and suicide. While the butler was away on a\nshort vacation, the judge fell into a ditch, drunk. Unconscious and\nclose to death, he was pulled out by a stranger and taken to the local\nhospital, where he recovered. When the butler returned to the village,\nhe ran into a group of women who were speculating about the identity\nof the stranger who saved the judge\u2019s life by taking him to the\nhospital. One of the women said she thought that Milford saved the\njudge\u2019s life. The butler, who hadn\u2019t yet heard about the\naccident and thought the women were talking about the judge\u2019s\nfinancial traumas, reacted with (13):\n\n(13)\nI agree. I, too, suspect that Milford saved the judge\u2019s\nlife.\n\n\nThe next day, when discussion of the judge\u2019s accident continued,\nsomebody said:\n\n(14)\nThe butler suspects that Milford saved the judge\u2019s\nlife.\n\n\nGiven that the butler\u2019s suspicion is not about the accident,\nthere is a sense in which this belief attribution is not true. It\nseems infelicitous, if not outright false. This suggests that our\nimagined assertion of (14) makes a claim about a particular situation\nthat the suspicion is about. In the context of the story, that\nsituation is the one everyone was talking about, and where the judge\nwas rescued from the ditch. Since the butler has no suspicion about\nsuch a situation, the person who uttered (14) said something\ninfelicitous or false. If (14) simply said that the butler suspected\nthat there was a situation where Milford saved the judge\u2019s life,\nthe assertion would be true. There is support for the Austinian\nperspective on assertions and attitude ascriptions, then.\n\nAustinian topic situations (also referred to as \u201cfocus\nsituations\u201d, \u201cdescribed situations\u201d, or\n\u201creference situations\u201d in the literature) are often\nnon-overt, but the tense of a sentence might give them away. A close\nlook at tenses tells us that topic situations do not always coincide\nwith the situations described by the main predication of a sentence.\nKlein (1994, 4) imagines a witness who is asked by a judge what she\nnoticed when she looked into the room. The witness answered with\n(15):\n\n(15)\nThere was a book on the table. It was in Russian.\n\n\nIt is surprising that there is a past tense in the second sentence,\neven though the book must have still been in Russian when the witness\nwas called for testimony. Even more surprising is the fact that the\nwitness could not have said (16) instead of (15).\n\n(16)\n# There was a book on the table. It is in Russian.\n\n\nTranslated into a situation semantics (Klein himself talks about topic\ntimes, rather than topic situations), Klein\u2019s explanation is\nthat tense relates utterance situations to topic situations, which do\nnot necessarily coincide with the situations described by the main\npredication of a sentence. In Klein\u2019s scenario, the topic\nsituation for the second part of the witness\u2019s answer was the\npast situation that she saw when she looked into the room. Since the\ntopic situation was past, tense marking in the second sentence of (16)\nhas to be past, too. Via their temporal locations, topic situations\nplay an important role in the semantics of both tense and aspect (see\nthe entry on\n tense and aspect;\n also Smith 1991, Kamp & Reyle 1993, and Cipria & Roberts\n2000).\n\nIf Austinian topic situations play a role in the grammars of natural\nlanguages, there should be grammatical devices in at least some\nlanguages that track them. Recent work by Andrew McKenzie (McKenzie\n2012, 2015) has suggested that certain Switch Reference systems in a\nnumber of genetically unrelated languages seem to track Austinian\ntopic situations. For example, the North American language Kiowa\n(Tanoan, spoken in Oklahoma) uses different forms for certain\nsentential connectives (including conjunction), depending on whether\nthe topic situations of the conjoined conjuncts changes or stays the\nsame.\n",
