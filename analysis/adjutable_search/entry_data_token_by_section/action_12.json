    "main_text": "Practical Knowledge || The possibility of practical knowledge\n4.5 The possibility of practical knowledge\n\nRegardless of whether one adheres to the knowledge condition (or some\nweakened version of the view), it is generally agreed that agents\ncan have a special kind of knowledge by exercising their\npractical capacities in intentional action. However, what makes our\npractical capacities suitable source of knowledge? Anscombe devoted\nlittle attention to this question, but an answer to it could be the\nkey to working out a version of (iii) in the previous section.\n\nHere is a simple answer: A person can know that p (e.g. that\nshe (herself) is walking), on the basis of exercising her will,\nbecause when she does so successfully p is true. Two related\nproblems immediately arise for this simple account. First, truth is\ninsufficient for knowledge. Minimally, epistemic warrant is also\nneeded, but the simple account does not give even a hint as to how\nsuch warrant could be acquired through agency (Newstead 2006). Second,\nthere are notorious cases that seem to meet the conditions provided by\nthe simple answer, but where there isn\u2019t knowledge. One case is\nlucky wishful thinking (Langton 2004), e.g., if partly on the basis of\noptimistic thinking I luckily pull off a jump I would not normally\nmake. Another is pessimistic thinking (Harman 1986; 1997), e.g., if I\ntrip partly on the basis of thinking that I will trip. In neither case\ndo I possess knowledge on the basis of my thoughts, despite the\nthoughts bringing about the truth of their contents. At best,\ntherefore, the simple answer is incomplete, and must be supplemented\nwith a story that explains how it is that the characteristic thoughts\nof the agent differ from wishful and pessimistic thoughts, such as to\nprovide epistemic warrant.\n\nAn influential account of this sort was provided in foundational work\nby Velleman (1989). Simplifying somewhat, Velleman argues that human\nbeings have a core desire to know themselves. Like any desire, this\none will motivate agents to satisfy it. In addition, they have the\ncapacities to (a) have thoughts about what they are doing and will do,\nand (b) have thoughts that are self-referential, e.g. <this very\nthought won\u2019t make me famous>. Suppose, then, that someone\nhas the thought <I will go to the store in virtue of this\nthought>. Then, given the desire to know herself, the agent will be\nmotivated to make this thought true. Hence, thought structures of this\nsort (\u2018intentions\u2019) will give the agent reasons to believe\nthat what she intends will be true.\n\nSeveral worries have been raised against Velleman\u2019s view. One is\nthat it makes dubious empirical claims, theorizing about the mind from\nthe armchair. In response, Velleman (2000a) has provided empirical\nsupport for his more contentious psychological claim, that humans have\na deep desire for self-knowledge. Another worry is that this epistemic\nmechanism still looks too much like wishful thinking, believing that\nsomething is the case just because one wants it to be so (Langton\n2004; see Setiya 2008; Velleman 2014 for replies). Finally, it is\nunclear why, if an agent realizes that the content of her intention is\nnot realized, she must make it true that it is, rather than simply\ngive up the belief (that she will act in a certain way). After all, we\ncan pursue the aim of knowing ourselves both by ensuring that beliefs\nabout ourselves are true and by giving up beliefs about\nourselves that are false.\n\nWorries of this sort led Velleman to distinguish\n\u201cdirective\u201d from \u201creceptive\u201d cognition\n(Velleman 2000, ch.7); but it has led others to consider the\nalternative view that practical knowledge is a standard form of\ninferential knowledge (Grice 1971; O\u2019Shaughnessy 1980, 2003;\nPaul 2009a). On the most sophisticated inferentialist account, due to\nPaul (2009a), agents take advantage of the special knowledge they have\nof their intentions to make inferences about what is happening and\nwill happen. Given that intentions are reliably executed, such\ninferences reliably yield knowledge. A more radical inferentialist\nalternative, suggested by authors like Carruthers (2011) on the basis\nof empirical evidence, is that we know our actions on the basis of the\nsame processes by which we know others\u2019 minds: we essentially\npredict what actions are most likely to happen, given what else we\nknow about others\u2019 motives and beliefs\u2014it\u2019s just\nthat we know a lot more about our own minds. (Similar views about\nself-knowledge in general are defended by Gopnik 1993, and have their\norigin in Ryle 1949. For criticisms, see Boyle 2022; Levy 2022.)\n\nInferentialist accounts give up on a feature that was central to\nAnscombe\u2019s understanding of practical knowledge, its immediate\ncharacter (see e.g. O\u2019Brien 2007). However, Paul (2009a) argues\nthat the appearance of immediacy can be explained by the fact that\ninferences \u201ccan take place rapidly and automatically at a\nnon-conscious level, without the mindful entertaining of premises or\nfeeling of drawing a conclusion\u201d (p.10). Yet, several challenges\nhave been raised against inferentialist accounts, including: (i) that\nthey can\u2019t explain the tight nexus between intentional action\nand practical knowledge (Setiya 2007, 2008, 2009); (ii) that they\ncan\u2019t explain the first-personal character of practical\nknowledge (Wilson 2000; Schwenkler 2012); and (iii) that they at best\ngive us alienated, observational knowledge (Pi\u00f1eros Glasscock\n2021).\n\nThere are, finally, several non-inferentialist stories about how\npractical knowledge is possible. Some accounts appeal to knowledge-how\nor skill as the state by which an intention ensures that its content\nis not only true but also justified, so as to amount to knowledge\n(Setiya 2012; Small 2012; Valaris 2021). Another view, due to\nO\u2019Brien (2007), explains practical knowledge in terms of the\nexercise of deliberative capacities. The agent knows what she is doing\nbecause the selection of an action is done via the exercise of\ncapacities that narrow options in terms of the practical possibilities\nof the agent. Others take practical knowledge to be inferential, but\nthe inference in question is practical inference. On this view,\npractical knowledge is warranted by the practical considerations that\nconstitute the agent\u2019s practical reasoning (Harman 1997;\nTenenbaum 2007; Ross 2009; Maru\u0161i\u0107 and Schwenkler 2018;\nCampbell 2018; Frey 2019). Finally, some have tried to show that\naccounts of epistemic warrant or entitlement designed to explain how\nwe can directly believe on the basis of perception might explain how\nwe can directly believe on the basis of our wills (Peacocke 2003;\nNewstead 2006; Pi\u00f1eros Glasscock 2020a). As this brief and\nincomplete summary indicates, there is not yet anything close to a\nconsensus about how best to explain the epistemic standing for\npractical knowledge.\n",
