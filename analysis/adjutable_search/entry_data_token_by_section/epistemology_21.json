Through introspection, one knows what mental\nstates one is currently in: whether one is thirsty, tired, excited, or\ndepressed. Compared with perception, introspection appears to have a\nspecial status. It is easy to see how a perceptual seeming can go\nwrong: what looks like a cup of coffee on the table might be just be a\nclever hologram that\u2019s visually indistinguishable from an actual\ncup of coffee. But can it introspectively seem to me that I have a\nheadache when in fact I do not? It is not easy to see how it could be.\nThus introspection is widely thought to enjoy a special kind of\nimmunity to error. But what does this amount to?\n\nFirst, it could be argued that, when it comes to introspection, there\nis no difference between appearance and reality; therefore,\nintrospective seemings infallibly constitute their own success.\nAlternatively, one could view introspection as a source of certainty.\nHere the idea is that an introspective experience of p\neliminates any possible reason for doubt as to whether p is\ntrue. Finally, one could attempt to explain the specialness of\nintrospection by examining the way we respond to first-person reports:\ntypically, we attribute a special authority to such reports. According\nto this approach, introspection is incorrigible: its deliverances\ncannot be corrected by any other source.\n\nHowever we construe the special kind of immunity to error that\nintrospection enjoys, such immunity is not enjoyed by perception. Some\nfoundationalists have therefore thought that the foundations of our\nempirical knowledge can be furnished by introspection of our own\nperceptual experiences, rather than perception of mind-independent\nthings around us.\n\nIs it really true, however, that, compared with perception,\nintrospection is in some way special? Critics of foundationalism have\nargued that introspection is not infallible. Might one not confuse an\nunpleasant itch for a pain? Might I not think that the shape before me\nappears circular to me when in fact it appears slightly elliptical to\nme? If it is indeed possible for introspection to mislead, then it is\nnot clear in what sense introspection can constitute its own success,\nprovide certainty, or even incorrigibility. Yet it also isn\u2019t\neasy to see either how, if one clearly and distinctly feels a\nthrobbing headache, one could be mistaken about that. Introspection,\nthen, turns out to be a mysterious faculty. On the one hand, it does\nnot seem to be an infallible faculty; on the other hand, it is not\neasy to see how error is possible in many specific cases of\n introspection.[56]\n\nThe definition of introspection as the capacity to know the present\ncontents of one\u2019s own mind leaves open the question of how\nsimilar the different exercises of this capacity may be from one\nanother. According to some epistemologists, when we exercise this\ncapacity with respect to our sensations, we are doing something very\ndifferent from what we do when we exercise this capacity with respect\nto our own conscious beliefs, intentions, or other rationally\nevaluable states of mind: our exercises of this capacity with respect\nto our own conscious, rationally evaluable states of mind is, they\nclaim, partly constitutive of our being in those very states.\nIn support of this claim, they point out that we sometimes address\nquestions of the form \u201cdo you believe that p?\u201d by\nconsidering whether it is true that p, and reporting our belief\nconcerning p not by inspecting our mind, but rather by making up our\nmind (see Moran 2001 and Boyle 2009 for defenses of this view; see\nGertler 2011 for objections to the view).\n",
