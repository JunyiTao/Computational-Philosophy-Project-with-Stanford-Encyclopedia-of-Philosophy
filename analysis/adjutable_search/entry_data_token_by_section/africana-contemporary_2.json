    "main_text": "Framing themes: circumscribing the topic || Problematicity\n1.2 Problematicity\n\nThe notion of Africanaity draws out the part of Gordon\u2019s quick\ndefinition of Africana philosophy that focuses on the diaspora. But\nwhat about the rest? What does it mean to refer to the problems that\nthe diaspora faces and raises? And why dwell on these problems as a\nway of framing this study?\n\nAdditional language from Gordon may be helpful. He explains:\n\n\nSince there was no reason for the people of the African continent to\nhave considered themselves African until that identity was imposed\nupon them through conquest and colonization in the modern era \u2026\nthis area of thought also refers to the unique set of questions raised\nby the emergence of \u201cAfricans\u201d and their diaspora\u2026\n. Such concerns include the convergence of most Africans with the\nracial term \u201cblack\u201d and its many connotations. (Gordon\n2008, 1)\n\n\nGordon\u2019s point is that taking Africanaity seriously means asking\nabout the conditions under which the concept came to have something to\nrefer to. And to ask about these conditions is to explore a handful of\nsocial, methodological, and broadly philosophical problems, and to\nconsider certain oddly robust links between these problems and the\nAfricana condition.\n\nI\u2019ll refer to this constellation of problems and their\nconnection to the Africana condition as problematicity. This second\nframing theme sets three vital tasks for the field.\n\nFirst, it is important to grapple responsibly with the very real\nproblems that face Africa and its diaspora. There are many obvious\nexamples, from imperial incursions and forced migrations to asymmetric\nintegration into the world economy and authoritarian post-independence\ngovernance. Philosophical inquirers may take these conditions as their\nsubject matter, but they will also have to grapple with the way these\nconditions shape and constrain the prospects for intellectual\nwork.\n\nSecond, it is equally important, if not more so, to call out and\ncorrect for the tendency to assume that Africana communities\ndon\u2019t just face problems but are also somehow inherently prone\nto them. The thought here is that the condition of Africanaity is not\nsimply about facing problems, but also, in a way, about being\na problem. I\u2019ve borrowed this way of putting it from a germinal\nformulation by one of the canonical figures of Africana thought. Early\nin his career, W.E.B. Du Bois famously invited his readers to consider\na puzzling question on behalf of people racialized as Black: how\ndoes it feel to be a problem? (Du Bois \u201cOf Our Spiritual\nStrivings\u201d [1903] 1986, 363). That is (in part) to say: how does\nit feel to move through life as a living representative of a\nsociety\u2019s ethical lapses and epistemic incapacities, and to\ncontend with the social pressure to think of oneself as the source of\nthese problems? In light of the substantial overlap between\nAfricanaity and Blackness, the tendency \u201cto view Black people as\na problem people\u201d is very much at issue for Africa and its\ndiaspora (West 1999, 104).\n\nThe phenomenological depth of this second mode of problematicity\npoints to a third mode, which involves not simply facing or being a\nproblem, but also raising problems. We\u2019ve already seen\nthis at work to some degree, in the way the Africana idea prompts\nquestions in metaphysics, ethics, and epistemology. But Africanaity\nalso raises deeper problems of method and world-view and, in some\nsenses of the word, ontology. The discursive event that V. Y. Mudimbe\n(1988) dubs \u201cthe invention of Africa\u201d complicates or, one\nmight say, short-circuits certain standard modern modes of\nphilosophical comportment\u2014or, better put, forces philosophical\nEuro-modernity to misrepresent and perhaps misunderstand its actual\nanimating imperatives. This complication leads Hegel to extrude Africa\nfrom his staging of world history while doing considerable violence to\nactual history and to geography. It leads figures like Thomas\nJefferson and John Locke to mirror the contradictions of modern\npolitical thought in their works and their lives. It leads Fanon (in\nanother germinal contribution to Africana thought) to note that reason\nwalks out of the room when he walks in. Thoughts like these have\ninspired Gordon (2000) and others to organize a great deal of fruitful\nphilosophical work around the epistemological challenges of\n\u201cshifting the geography of reason\u201d and of bringing the\nhuman sciences to bear on populations whose members are often only\ntenuously regarded as\n human.[2]\n\n(To be clear: the claim here is not that African-descended people and\ncultures are somehow problematic by nature. Sober reflection\non the empirical evidence and on plausible meanings of \u201cby\nnature\u201d cannot sustain that thought. The claim is that a)\nEuro-modernity was in some ways built on the conviction that\nAfrican-descended people are inherently problematic, and that b)\nphilosophical interventions that resist this conviction become\nproblems, render themselves problematic, for hegemonic approaches to\nphilosophy.)\n\nThe point of starting with these framing themes is to mark certain\nvital contexts for Africana philosophical reflection. To study\nAfricana philosophy is, first of all, to do the things one does in\nother areas of philosophy: consider a range of characteristic\nquestions and problems, study a cohort of canonical figures and texts,\nparticipate in living debates organized around familiar tropes and\nmoves, and so on. But it is also to do these things in contexts\ndefined by foundational questions\u2014about, for example, the nature\nof philosophical inquiry, the structure and impact of concrete\nmechanisms for knowledge production, and even the humanity of the\ninquirers\u2014to a degree that is fairly unusual. As an emblem of\nthis, consider that the establishment of African philosophy as a\nrespectable subject of study\u2014in a sense of\n\u201crespectable\u201d to be fleshed out below\u2014began with\ndebates over a single, simple, now-obsolete question: can Africans\neven do philosophy?\n\nHaving worked through the themes that emerged from Gordon\u2019s\ndeceptively simple definition of Africana philosophy, we are now in a\nbetter position to receive a similar but more elaborate definition.\nOutlaw describes \u201cAfricana philosophy\u201d as \u201ca\nthird-order, metaphilosophical, umbrella-concept\u2026 . [T]he name\ndoes not refer to a particular philosophy, philosophical system,\nmethod, or tradition\u201d (Outlaw 2017, \u00a71, par. 1). It refers\ninstead to a field of study that emerges from the distinctive\nconditions that produce and implicate Africa and its diaspora, that\ntakes seriously the experiences and reflections of the peoples who are\nmost directly affected and implicated by those conditions, and that,\nas a result of the first two factors, tends to feature certain\nrecurring preoccupations or themes. Some of those preoccupations and\nthemes appear above, and will receive more attention, alongside\nseveral additional themes, in the sections to come.\n\n(Outlaw also identifies a number of \u201ckey heuristic\npresumptions\u201d that can help to ward off easy misconceptions\n[Outlaw 2017, \u00a71, par. 2]. The most important of these\npresumptions are that a) there are responsible ways to account for the\nunity and distinctiveness of the phenomena that bear the predicate\n\u201cAfricana\u201d; b) these accounts do not presuppose uniformity\nand homogeneity among Africana peoples and cultures, and they need not\naspire to or prescribe such uniformity; and c) \u201ccontributors [to\nAfricana philosophy] need not be persons African or of African\ndescent\u201d (Outlaw 2017, \u00a71, par. 5). As noted above, this\nentry will not delve any further into these presumptions. Readers\nseeking reassurance about these issues may consult the foundational\ntexts that Outlaw (2017) and Gordon (2008) explore in their overviews\nof the field.)\n",
