Recurring charges\ninclude that liberalism fails to accommodate communal values like\nsolidarity; (Dawson and Jennings 2012); that the conception of persons\nas free and equal involves a skewed account of human nature; and that\nliberalism lacks the resources to provide an adequate conception of\nthe public or the common good. For instance, in an agenda-setting\npaper for a non-liberal feminist framework for public health ethics,\nBaylis, Kenny, and Sherwin write, \u201cWe agree with Bruce Jennings\nthat \u2019[t]he liberal framing of public health ethics is useful up to a\npoint, but it is ultimately too narrow to provide normative\njustification for \u2013 or adequate moral insight about \u2013 the\nkinds of social change public health must strive to bring\nabout,\u2019\u201d (Baylis and Kenny and Sherwin 2008,\n 196).[29]\n\nCivic republicans agree with liberals that freedom is a central\n\u2013 or perhaps the central \u2013 value of political morality.\nYet republicans offer a definition of freedom that rivals the one that\nthe liberal proposes. Rather than espousing the liberal position that\nfreedom consists of negative liberty or freedom as non-interference,\nrepublicans claim that conditions of non-domination constitute freedom\n(Pettit 1997; Pettit 2012). While there are a variety of definitions\nof non-domination, two claims typically lie at its core: first, to\nenjoy true freedom, one must be free from arbitrary interference, and\nsecond, one\u2019s freedom from arbitrary interference must be robust\n\u2013 one must enjoy it in a variety of nearby possible worlds. An\noft-employed example to illustrate the distinction between\nnon-interference and non-domination is the case of an enslaved person\nwho has a benevolent slave-owner who permits the enslaved person to do\nwhatever they wish and provides the enslaved person with plentiful\nresources. Yet the enslaver could, if they so chose, prohibit the\nenslaved person from using the provided resources or performing\nvarious actions. Because the enslaver has this power over the enslaved\nperson and could exercise it, the enslaved person does not enjoy\ngenuine freedom. Instead, the enslaved person is dominated (Lovett\n2001; Lovett 2018; Pettit 1997; Pettit 2012; Skinner 1998; Skinner\n2008; see also the\n entry on republicanism).\n\nRepublicans argue that the power to interfere is non-arbitrary \u2013\nand thus non-dominating \u2013 when it is genuinely public. In order\nfor power to be genuinely public, it needs to be subject to procedures\nthat track the interests of those subject to it, typically citizens.\nFor procedures to track these interests, republicans often argue that\nconstitutionally protected rights, as well as a representative and\nreasonably well-functioning democracy, are all necessary. When such\nconditions are satisfied, the public exercises political power in a\nway that ensures that each is free. When political institutions fail\nto track the interests of citizens in the requisite ways, however,\ncitizens are subjection to the arbitrary will of states. Accordingly,\nrather than construing legislation as freedom-restricting, when such\nlegislation tracks the interests of citizens and enables individuals\nto avoid being subject to the arbitrary will of others, democratic\nlegislation enhances freedom (Pettit 1997, 2012).\n\nWhen it comes to public health, some have claimed that civic\nrepublicanism is better-suited than liberalism as a foundational\ntheory (see Jennings 2007; Jennings 2009; Weinstock 2016). Rather than\nfocusing on a purported tension between government action that\npromotes public health and freedom as non-interference, republicans\nargue government has an indispensable role in ensuring that\nindividuals are not subject to the arbitrary will of others as a\nconsequence, for example, of poverty or the need to maintain\nemployer-provided medical insurance. One natural extension of\nrepublican thought in the domain of public health concerns how\npowerful private actors can subject us to their arbitrary will through\nmanipulative advertising or pricing, and unhealthy labor practices. On\nthis proposed application of republican theory, a major role of public\nhealth is to prevent domination by these powerful private actors.\nPublic health agencies are thus described not as interfering with\nfreedom, but as enhancing it.\n\nVarious liberal theorists of public health resist the republican\ncharacterization of their view and the republicans\u2019 claims about the\ndefects of liberalism (Rajczi 2016; Radoilska 2009). Moreover, while\nthe republican approach to public health is provocative, it faces\nsignificant challenges. Some of these problems apply to republicanism\ngenerally. For instance, some object that republicanism gives short\nshrift to the moral importance of non-interference (Larmore 2001; Wall\n2001; List and Valentini 2016). Others have objected that the\n\u2018non-arbitrary\u2019 qualification of being subject to the will\nof another yields counter-intuitive results. For instance, if someone\nis non-arbitrarily imprisoned, then they certainly seem to be\ndominated in any ordinary understanding of \u2018domination.\u2019\nHowever, it seems to follow from the republican definition that the\nindividual is not dominated (List and Valentini 2016).\n\nOther concerns about republicanism focus on the central importance of\ndemocratic decision-making to ensure freedom from non-domination, and\nhere some distinctive issues for public health ethics emerge. As we\nhave noted, public health interventions are frequently implemented or\ndecided upon by agencies that have a relatively limited democratic\npedigree. Advocates of public health can defend the large role of\nadministrative agencies by appeal to a range of justifications,\nincluding realizing conditions of justice, overall benefit, or even\nsome form of paternalism, but it is less clear what republicans can\nsay here (Weinstock 2016). Some might insist that, contrary to what\nsome republican health ethicists claim, republicanism limits the scope\nof public health as currently practiced, since the relatively\nattenuated democratic pedigree of administrative agencies limits their\nmandate. On this sort of view, public health should be more subject to\ndemocratic control. But making public health more democratic to avoid\nworries about non-domination so understood engenders its own problems.\nOne worry is that the rich notions of the public and citizenship as\nproposed by civic republicans are objectionably demanding, given the\namount of time individuals would have to spend engaged in the work of\npolitics (Latham 2016). More fundamentally, to claim that public\nhealth needs to be much more democratic and, therefore, that it enjoys\nless legitimacy than public health advocates currently claim appears\nto undercut the initial motivation for adopting republicanism: to find\na theory that is better-suited than liberalism for legitimating a\nbroad mandate for public health.\n\nAnother worry specific to public health ethics concerns how much of\nthe public health portfolio actually engages in activities that\npromote freedom as non-domination. While many public health\ninterventions, such as those that regulate the health claims of food\nand drug manufacturers, can plausibly be construed as helping to\nadvance freedom as non-domination, many others are harder to fit under\nthis description. Consider, for example, infectious disease\nsurveillance and vaccine programs, or educational campaigns promoting\nphysical activity. It is something of a stretch to claim that these\nkinds of public health policies and practices constitute an\nimprovement to freedom as non-domination. But even if we accept such a\ndescription, any advances to freedom as non-domination seem to be a\ndesirable side effect of the policy rather than the real grounds for\nenacting it. Others \u2013 e.g., (Viens 2016) \u2013 charge that the\nemphasis on individual freedom as non-domination is not much of an\nimprovement over individual freedom as non-interference, since public\nhealth should ultimately be concerned with the well-being of\npopulations rather than individuals.\n\nPerhaps because of these concerns, some who take a republican approach\nto public health ethics work with a more expansive understanding of\nthe appropriate role of government in public health, one that includes\nadvancing the common good as well as promoting freedom as\nnon-domination (Jennings 2007, 46-47). Yet if the promotion of the\ncommon good ultimately justifies a justification for public health\npolicy, then it would seem that we are stuck with something close to\nthe familiar tension between individual freedom, albeit construed as\nfreedom as non-domination, and the common good \u2013 the tension\nthat animates the concerns of those operating out of the liberal\ntradition. And just as the liberal faces questions about how to\nreconcile tensions between the common good and freedom as\nnon-interference, it would seem the republican faces difficult\nquestions about how to reconcile tensions between the common good and\nfreedom as non-domination.\n",
