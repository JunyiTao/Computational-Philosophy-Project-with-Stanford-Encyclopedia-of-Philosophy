Baroque Constellations\n\n \u2018Mourning-play\u2019 (Trauerspiel)\nis a term used to characterise a type of drama that emerges during the\nbaroque period of art history in the late 16th and early 17th century.\nThe principle examples discussed in Benjamin\u2019s thesis come not\nfrom its great exponents, Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca and William\nShakespeare, but the German dramatists Martin Opitz, Andreas Gryphius,\nJohann Christian Hallmann, Daniel Caspar von Lohenstein, and August\nAdolf von Haugwitz. Their plays are characterised by a simplicity of\naction which is comparable to the classicism of earlier Renaissance\ntheatre, but also contain peculiarly baroque features. These include an\nexaggerated and violent bombast in their language (including a\nfigurative tendency towards linguistic contraction), an absence of\npsychological depth in its characters, a preponderance of and\ndependency upon theatrical props and machinery, and a crude emphasis on\nviolence, suffering and death (cf. Newman 2011; Ferber 2013).\nLeaving aside for now the methodological introduction (referred to\nin English as the \u2018Epistemo-Critical Prologue\u2019), the first\npart of Benjamin\u2019s thesis is concerned with repudiating the dogmatic\nattempt by later critics to impose onto these plays the external\ncriteria of Aristotelian aesthetics, which are rooted in classical\ntragedy. Benjamin\u2019s understanding of tragedy here (and his approach to\nthe mourning-play in general) is partially influenced by Friedrich\nNietzsche\u2019s The Birth of Tragedy. Benjamin claims\nthat The Birth of Tragedy substantiates the critical insight\nthat the empathy of undirected modern feeling is unhelpful for properly\ngrasping ancient tragedy (OGT, 93).  Instead, Nietzsche undertook a\nmetaphysical inquiry into the essence of tragedy as a dialectical\ninterplay of the contrasting aesthetic impulses of Apollonian\nsemblance and Dionysian truth. This dialectic is central to Benjamin\u2019s\nown philosophical investigations, particularly his claim\u2014derived\nfrom his discussion of Goethe\u2019s Elective\nAffinities\u2014that an expressionless moment is constitutive of\nart, in which the limits of semblance are broached precisely in order\nto illuminate an artistic truth.\nBut Benjamin is also critical of Nietzsche for restricting his\napproach to aesthetics, and therefore renouncing the understanding of\ntragedy in historical terms. Lacking a philosophy of history,\nNietzsche\u2019s study was unable to situate the political and ethical\nsignificance of the metaphysical and mythical features it isolates\n(OGT, 93). Influenced by ideas from Franz Rosenzweig and Florens\nChristian Rang (Asman 1992), Benjamin presents tragedy as\nexpressing a perceived break between the prehistorical age of mythical\ngods and heroes and the emergence of a new ethical and political\ncommunity. The historical limitations of Nietzsche\u2019s theory of\ntragedy become acute when it comes to the question of the possibility\nof a recuperation of the tragic form in modern theatre. Whilst\nNietzsche tends to simply denounce the weakness of modern drama against\nthe strength of the Greeks (excepting, in his early work, the operas of\nWagner), Benjamin is concerned with establishing whether the historical\nconditions of the tragic form are themselves a limit to its\ncontemporary efficacy.\u00a0\nIn line with the principles of Romantic criticism discussed above,\nmourning-plays contain their own distinct form and should be criticised\naccording to their own immanently discovered standards. The\n\u201ccontent [Gehalt]\u201d and \u201c\ntrue object\u201d of the baroque mourning-play is not, as it is in\ntragedy, myth but rather historical life (OGT, 46). As with\nGoethe\u2019s borrowing of the novella form, this content is in part\nderived from other aesthetic structures, principally the eschatological\nfocus of mediaeval Christian literature: the Passion-Plays,\nMystery-Plays and chronicles whose historiography portrayed \u201cthe\nwhole of the course of history, world history as salvation history\u201d (OGT,\n65). But the Lutheran renunciation of the Catholic emphasis upon good\nworks, and the secularizing tendency implicit in the naturalistic legal\nand political philosophies of the 16th and 17th century (discussed in\nrelation to Carl Schmitt\u2019s theory of sovereignty) resulted in the\nstripping bare of human value and significance from such history. This\ntense, antinomical combination of transcendence and immanence produces\nan uneasy hybrid, in which history\u2014as a narrative of the human\nmarch towards redemption on the Day of Judgement\u2014loses the\neschatological certainty of its redemptive conclusion, and becomes\nsecularized into a mere natural setting for the profane struggle over\npolitical power.\u00a0\nBenjamin\u2019s reflections on sovereign violence in the 17th century\nmay be contrasted with his discussion of the revolutionary kind in his\nearlier \u2018Critique of Violence\u2019 (\u2018Zur Kritik der\nGewalt\u2019, 1921), itself a response to Georges\nSorel\u2019s Reflections on Violence (1908).  These texts have\nprovoked a number of responses in the context of political theology,\nmost notably from Carl Schmitt, Jacques Derrida and Giorgio\nAgamben. Schmitt responded directly to Benjamin\u2019s essay in Hamlet\nor Hecuba (1956). Derrida\u2019s section on the \u2018Critique of\nViolence\u2019 in his Force of Law: The Mystical Foundation of\nAuthority (1989) interrogates this evocation of a revolutionary\nkind of divine violence, a critical engagement which continues in\nDerrida\u2019s discussion of the messianic in Spectres of Marx\n(1994) and \u2018Marx and Sons\u2019 (1999), and in relation to\nSchmitt in The Politics of Friendship (1994). These complex\nrelations between Benjamin, Schmitt, and Derrida have become the\nsubject of a number of studies, including Agamben\u2019s State\nof Exception (2004) (Bredekamp 1999, 247\u2013266; Liska 2009),\nalthough more careful studies have emphasized the clear divergences\nbetween Benjamin\u2019s position and those of Derrida and of Schmitt (Tomba\n2009, 131\u2013132; Averlar 2005, 79\u2013106; Weber 2008,\n176\u2013194). In this respect, it was not Schmitt\u2019s political\ntheology but the reactionary vitalism of Ludwig Klages that proved a\nmore influential and enduring object of fascination for Benjamin (Fuld\n1981; McCole 1993, 178\u2013180, 236\u2013246; Wolin 1994,\nxxxi\u2013xxxviii; Wohlfarth 2002, 65\u2013109; Lebovic 2013,\n1\u201310, 79\u2013110; Charles 2018, 52\u201362).\u00a0\nIn the second part of his thesis, Benjamin employs the concept of\nallegory to expose the implicit eschatological structure of these\nworks. However, the first part utilises the distorting tension of this\nstructure to distinguish the specific and historically conspicuous\ntechnique of the German baroque mourning-play. This concludes by\nidentifying sorrow or mourning (Trauer)\nas the predominant mood inherent to its metaphysical structure, in\ncontrast to the suffering of tragedy. With the \u201ctotal \nsecularization of the historical in the state of creation\u2026History\npasses into the setting\u201d to become natural history (OGT, 81),\nwhose attendant cognition is a melancholic contemplation of things\nwhich derives enigmatic satisfaction from its very recognition of their\ntransience and emptiness (OGT, 141). \u201cFor all wisdom of the\nmelancholic hearkens to the deep\u201d, Benjamin claims:\n\u201cit is won from immersion in the life of creaturely things, and\nnothing of the voice of revelation reaches it. Everything to do with Saturn\npoints into the depths of the earth\u2026\u201d (OGT, 157).\nTo grasp how the form of these works are determined by their truth\ncontent requires a reconstruction of the baroque concept of the\nallegorical which structures its mood of melancholic contemplativeness.\nBenjamin\u2019s claim is that a genuine understanding of the\nallegorical as it emerged in its highest form in the 17th century has\nbeen obscured by, on the one hand, the later Romantic aestheticizing of\nthe symbol and, on the other, by the tendency to conceive the\nallegorical negatively in its contrast with this devalued, aesthetic\nconcept. It is only by first recovering a genuine theological concept\nof the symbol, therefore, that we are able in turn to distinguish an\nauthentic concept of the allegorical. This it to be done by reasserting\nthe profound but paradoxical theological unity between the material and\nthe transcendental found in the symbolic. The fundamental distinction\nbetween theological concepts of symbol and the allegory will then be\nseen as concerning not their differing objects (Idea vs. abstract\nconcept), but the differing ways in which they signify, express or\nrepresent this object. Benjamin will conclude that this difference is,\nspecifically, a temporal one.\u00a0\nDrawing on undeveloped insights found in the work of the\nmythographers Georg Friedrich Creuzer and Johann Joseph von\nG\u00f6rres, Benjamin points out how \u201cthe temporal measure for the experience of the symbol[Symbolerfahrung] is the mystical instant\n[Nu]\u201d (OGT, 173). We must understand the temporality of\nthe allegorical, in contrast, as something dynamic, mobile, and\nfluid. This authentic concept of allegory arises in the 17th century\nbaroque as a response to the antithesis between mediaeval religiosity\nand Renaissance secularization discussed earlier. The spatialization\nof the temporal structure of eschatology in the allegorical\ncorresponds to the naturalization of the religious structure of\nhistory in the baroque: \u201cWhereas in the symbol, with the\nsublimation of downfall, the transfigured countenance of nature reveals itself \nfleetingly in the light of salvation, in allegory\nthere lies before the eyes of the observer the facies hippocratica [lit. \u2018Hippocratic face\u2019\n= the sunken, hollow and pinched features exhibited by the dying] of history\nas petrified primal\nlandscape. History, in everything untimely, sorrowful, and miscarried that belongs to it from the beginning, is inscribed in a\nface\u2014no, in a death\u2019s head [Totenkopfe]\u201d\n(OGT, 174).\nFrom the perspective of the allegorical, the instantaneous\ntransformation within the symbolic becomes a natural history slowed to\nsuch an extreme that every sign appears frozen and\u2014seemingly\nloosened from every other relationship\u2014arbitrary. The concrete\ncorporeality of the written script exemplifies this allegorical\nemphasis upon things. Allegory is not the conventional\nrepresentation of some expression, as misunderstood by later critics,\nbut an expression of convention [Ausdruck der\nKonvention] (OGT, 185). Allegorical expression includes as its\nobject this very conventionality of the historical, this appearance of\ninsignificance and indifference. That is, convention itself comes to\nbe signified or expressed. What Benjamin rediscovers in the\nallegorical is, then, something akin to the concept of the\nexpressionless, as the torso of a symbol, introduced in the essay on\nGoethe. Benjamin argues that this predominance of the allegorical\nviewpoint in the 17th century baroque finds it most dramatic\nexpression in the mourning-play, and that consequently the Idea of the\nmourning-play must be grasped via the allegorical.\n The Erkenntniskritische Vorrede\nor \u2018Epistemo-Critical Prologue\u2019 to the work may be\nunderstood as having\u00a0 two central functions: it provides a direct\nmethodological justification for the theory of criticism being utilised\nin the work, by way of a problematization of existing disciplinary\napproaches, and it implicitly recovers a concept of allegorical\nexperience which is delineated\u00a0 in the second part of the thesis\nin terms amenable for modernity. At the level of methodology, Benjamin\nadvocates the necessity of a transdisciplinary approach (Osborne 2011, 24) to artworks,\ncapable of critically overcoming the epistemological and historical\nlimitations of the existing disciplines of the philosophy of art and\nthe history of art (specifically, literary history). This\ntransdisciplinary aspect of Benjamin\u2019s thesis may partially\naccount for the difficulties in its reception at the University of\nFrankfurt, where the thesis was rejected by the departments of both\nphilosophy and literature. Much of the theoretical discussion in the\nPrologue is concerned with correcting the methodological one-sidedness\nof each existing approach by way of the positive features of the other.\nIn general, the philosophy of art correctly attends to the problem of\nessences, but remains hampered by its lack of any adequate historical\nconsideration. Conversely, the history of art is preoccupied with\nhistorical lineage but has no adequate concept of essence. Yet it is\nnot simply an amalgamation of aesthetics and history that is required,\nbut their radical rethinking in accordance with first a historical\nconcept of essence and second a philosophical concept of history.\u00a0\n Broadly speaking, Benjamin\u2019s theory of Ideas transposes the\nphilosophical problem of metaphysical realism into the context of\naesthetics. That is, it asks about the reality of aesthetic genres such\nas \u2018tragedy\u2019 or of artistic epochs such as the\n\u2018Renaissance\u2019 that classify a group of particular works\naccording to a set of common characteristics. The Prologue criticises\nexisting traditions of aesthetic nominalism for their inadequate\nresolution of the problem. The uncritical use of inductive methods\ndemonstrated by literary historians rejects the hypostatization of\nterms such as \u201cRenaissance\u201d on the grounds that it promotes\na false identity between similar empirical features, which obscures\ntheir diversity. This aversion to any realism of constitutive Ideas is\ngrounded on the positivist criterion of factual verification. A term\nlike the \u201cRenaissance\u201d is consequently utilised by them\nonly on the proviso that it is understood as merely an abstract general\nconcept. This quickly leads to scepticism, however, since its still\nfails to address the problematic criteria by which this general concept\nis initially picked out and abstracted from the multiplicity of\nparticulars or on what grounds these particulars are grouped together.\nConsequently, it fails to appreciate the necessity of the Platonic\npostulation of Ideas for the representation of essences: whilst\nconcepts seek to make the similar identical, Ideas are necessary to\neffect a dialectical synthesis between phenomenal extremes (OGT, 18\u201319).\nIn contrast, philosophers of art possess a concern with the essential\nthat ends up renouncing any notion of generic forms, on the grounds\nthat the singular originality of every single work entails the only\npossible essential genre must be the universal and individual one of\nart itself. The error\u2014as Benjamin had previously charged the\nEarly German Romantics, discussed above\u2014is to dissolve real and\nimportant aesthetic structures or forms into an undifferentiated unity\n(of art), which denies their irreducible multiplicity (OGT, 21\u201323).\n\nThe theory of Ideas presented in the Prologue is truncated and\ndifficult to understand outside the context of Benjamin\u2019s earlier\nworks, and the philosophical tradition that it engages with is further\nobscured in the first English translation. However, the critical aspects of\nBenjamin\u2019s investigation advocate\u2014against aesthetic\nversions of positivist empiricism\u2014a metaphysical realism, and,\nagainst certain versions of philosophical idealism, a non-singular\nessentialism. That is, he does not restrict the possibility of\nmetaphysical reality only to actual empirical particulars and he\nadvocates the multiplicity and not singularity of the essence\n(understood, in Goethean terms, as a harmony and not a unity of truth).\nIn doing so, he must address that\u00a0 \u2018theological\u2019\nparadox, mentioned in the discussion of symbol and allegory, of how the\ntranscendental/supersensuous appears immanently within the\nmaterial/sensuous. Benjamin is clear that the relation between Ideas\nand phenomenon is neither one of Aristotelian \u2018containment\u2019\nnor one of Kantian lawfulness or hypothesis. Ideas are not given to\nsome intellectual intuition, but they are capable of being sensuously\nrepresented. Such a sensuous representation of the truth remains the\ntask of philosophy.\nBenjamin\u2019s theoretical elaboration proceeds by startling imagistic\nreconfigurations of pre-existing elements within the philosophical\ntradition. He offers a number of possibilities for thinking such Ideas\nin the Prologue, taken from the realm not only of philosophy but of\naesthetics, theology and science. The first is the Platonic Idea, here\ndivorced from its association with the scientific ascent to some\npurely rational, objective knowledge (such as appears in the account\nof dialectic in the Republic) and instead linked to the\ndiscussion of beautiful semblance in the Symposium (OGT,\n6). The second is that of the Adamic Name, as developed in his\nearlier theory of language. In this context, he comments that the\nEarly German Romantics were frustrated in their attempt to renew the\ntheory of Ideas because truth took on the character of reflective\nconsciousness for them, rather than that intentionless, linguistic\ncharacter in which things were subsumed under essential Names by\nAdam\u2019s primal-interrogation [urvernehmen] (OGT, 15). Naming\nis the primal history [Urgeschicte] of signifying, indicating\na thing-like disinterest which contrasts with the directed, unifying\nintentionality of Husserlian phenomenology (OGT, 14). The third is\nthe Goethean Ideal, which is recalled here in the context of the\nFaustian \u201cMothers\u201d and which implicitly gestures towards\nhis earlier discussions of Goethe (OGT, 11). Finally, and most famously,\nBenjamin compares the virtual objectivity of the Idea represented\nthrough the reconfiguring of actual phenomena to an astrological\nconstellation, which simultaneously groups together and is revealed by\nthe cluster of individual stars (OGT, 11). Truth is said to be \u201cactualized in the round dance of presented Ideas [vergegenw\u00e4rtigt\nim Reigen der dargestellen Ideen]\u201d (OGT, 4). This concept of the constellation is taken up\ndirectly in Adorno\u2019s inaugural lecture \u2018The Actuality of\nPhilosophy\u2019, where he speaks of \u2018the manipulation of\nconceptual material by philosophy\u2026of grouping and trial\narrangement, of constellation and construction\u2019 (Adorno 1931,\n131). It comes to inform Benjamin\u2019s philosophical practice in his\nmajor writings from this point onwards, from One-Way Street\n(1928), via the methodological demand for the construction of history\nand the attendant theory of the dialectical image in his work related\nto the \u201cArcades Project\u201d in the 1930s, through to the\nconcept of history presented in his celebrated late essay, \u2018On\nthe Concept of History\u2019 (1940).\u00a0\nBenjamin\u2019s concern to reincorporate the perspective of\nart\u2019s temporal transformation demands an analogous\nradicalization. The \u201cgenetic and concrete classification\u201d\n(OGT, 24) that Benedetto Croce called history (in order to distinguish\nit from that generalizing thought that abstracts away from change and\ndevelopment) must now be reconciled with Benjamin\u2019s theory of\nIdeas. For the messianic philosophy of history that grounds\nBenjamin\u2019s work problematizes existing formulations of the\nconcepts of history and historical origin. In line with his discussion\nof the Idea, the concept of historical origin should not be reduced to\nthe causality and actuality of the empirically factual, nor should it\nbe regarded as a purely logical and timeless essence. It is not\nmerely, Benjamin argues, \u201cthe coming-to-be of what has originated \u201d and cannot be recognized in \u201cthe naked, manifest existence of the factual\u201d (OGT, 24). For the\n\u2018historical\u2019 sequence that permits the Idea to be\nrepresented must include not only that of the actual phenomena of a\ngiven period, but also that of their subsequent development in the\nunderstanding of later epochs. An investigation of the essence of the\nGerman mourning-play, for example, cannot restrict itself to\ncontemporaneous events and actual plays as if these were\n\u2018facts\u2019 settled and decided once and for all, but must\nalso investigate the changing understanding of this historical epoch\nand the varying reception of these plays, including the prior\nconditions of its own self-understanding. But nor is it a\n\u201cpurely logical\u201d category, as if the Idea were some\nessence detached from and unrelated to history, to be grasped through\nan abstraction from all these particular historical developments (OGT,\n25). Origin [Ursprung] is therefore distinguished from a\nmerely genetic coming-into-being [Enstehung] and evolutionary\ndevelopment of \u2018pure history\u2019, to include the essential\ninner history of the \u201clife of the works and forms\u201d (OGT,\n24\u20136). The \u201cscience of the Origin\u201d is a philosophical\nhistory, a history of the essential, whose contemplation enlists a\ndialectical perspective to grasp the form of the \u201coriginal\nphenomenon\u201d: as something subject to a process of becoming and\ndisappearing, and therefore only partial and incomplete.  Benjamin\nonce again resorts to an image: \u201cThe origin stands as eddy in the\nstream of becoming and vigorously draws the emerging material into its\nrhythm\u201d (OGT, 24). Criticism\nattempts to virtually reassemble the fore- and after-history [Vor-\nund Nachgeschichte] of the phenomena into a historical\nconstellation, in which the Idea is represented and the phenomena\nredeemed. This is its messianic function in relation to the historical\nAbsolute.\u00a0\nThe Prologue also seeks to rescue the allegorical experience\nrecognised in the mourning-plays for a modern theory of criticism.\nAllegorical contemplation aims at the ruination of things so that it\ncan, in its redemptive moment, construct [baun]\na new whole out of the elements of the old. The character of this\nconstruction distinguishes it from the creative invention of fantasy,\nsince it manipulates and rearranges pre-existing material. To leave an\nimprint or impression of this construction [Konstruktion]\nis one of its aims. This dual emphasis upon destruction and\nconstruction has led a number of scholars to see an anticipation of\nDerridean deconstruction in Benjamin\u2019s work (Fischer 1996,\nSection 1: Modernity/Postmodernity; Weber 2008, 122\u2013128), although it\nshould be noted that his consideration of the specific historicity of\nthis concept of criticism and his insistence of the immanent truth\ncontent of artworks remains resolutely modernist, and cannot be easily\nassimilated into any \u2018postmodernist\u2019 position (cf. Weigel\n1996, xiv). The underlying affinity between romanticism and the baroque\nlies in their shared modernist concern with correcting classicism in\nart and the quasi-mythical perspective of classicism in general (OGT,\n230; 185). The Prologue reflects upon this \u2018modernity\u2019 of\nthe baroque when it notes how the \u201cStriking analogies to the current state of German literature have repeatedly given rise to \u2026immersion in the Baroque\u201d (OGT, 36). Although Benjamin is\nciting the similarities between Expressionism in modern literature and\nthe Mannerist exaggeration of the baroque, his own reconstruction of\nallegorical experience and its value for aesthetic theory is\nexperienced according to a historical conjunction between the baroque\npast and the modernity of Benjamin\u2019s present: modernity both\nreveals and is revealed in the baroque.\u00a0\nThe book on mourning-plays concluded Benjamin\u2019s German \u201ccycle\nof production\u201d (C, 322). At the beginning of the 1920s\nBenjamin became immersed in what was planned as a large-scale study of\npolitical thought, of which only a few fragments and the \u2018Critique of\nViolence\u2019 remain (Steiner 2001, 61). As Uwe Steiner notes, while\nBenjamin\u2019s political thought may be situated in the milieu of\nExpressionist Nietzsche-reception, the centrality that the realization\nof happiness occupies in his definition of politics as \u201cthe\nsatisfaction of unenhanced humanness\u201d is constructed in direct\nopposition to Zarathustra\u2019s tragic heroism (Steiner 2001, 49\u201350,\n61\u201362). This marks both a continuity with and a break from what Irving\nWohlfarth has called his earlier \u201cpolitics of Youth\u201d (Wohlfarth 1992,\n164), which drew heavily on a philosophy of history and culture\ninfluenced by Nietzsche\u2019s Untimely Meditations. Benjamin\nremarked that his break from the Youth Movement did not constitute the\nabandonment of this earlier thought, however, but its submergence into\na \u2018harder, purer, more invisible radicalism\u2019 (C, 74). This in part\naccounts for what T. J. Clark describes as the \u201ccryptic\u201d character of\n- what Adorno termed (SW 4, 101-2) - the anthropological materialism\nof The Arcades Project, where, Clark comments, it is \u201cas if\nsuch a politics were being actively aired and developed elsewhere\u201d\n(Clark 2003, 45\u201346).\n\nA new cycle was initiated with One-Way Street\n(Einbahnstra\u00dfe), written 1923\u20136, published 1928),\nwhose form and content puts into practice that speculative concept of\nexperience, with its allegorical immersion into the depths of things,\nwhich was theoretically articulated in the works considered above. The\ncity furnishes the sensuous, imagistic material for One-Way\nStreet, whilst the genres of the leaflet, placard and\nadvertisement provide the constructive principle by which it is\nrearranged as a constellation.  This formal methodology resembles the\ntechnological media of photography and film, as well as the\navant-garde practices of Russian Constructivism and French\nSurrealism. This entails what Adorno describes as a \u201cphilosophy\ndirected against philosophy\u201d (Adorno 1955, 235) or what Howard\nCaygill calls a \u201cphilosophizing beyond philosophy\u201d\n(Caygill 1989, 119).\nThe presentation of contemporary capitalism as metropolitan\nmodernity in One-Way Street also marks the turning point in\nBenjamin\u2019s writings, away from what he retrospectively called\n\u201can archaic form of philosophizing naively caught up in\nnature\u201d (BA, 88) towards the development of \u201ca political\nview of the past\u201d (SW 2, 210). The theory of experience outlined\nin his early writings is enlisted for revolutionary ends. In the\nessay, \u2018Surrealism: The Last Snapshot of the European\nIntelligentsia\u2019 (1929), Surrealist experience provides an\nexample of a \u201cprofane illumination\u201d, which in contrast to\nthe sacred and moralistic kind found in religion was guided by a\npolitical and a \u201cmaterialistic, anthropological\ninspiration\u201d (SW 2, 209). The latent energy residing in the most\ndestitute and outmoded of things is, through the construction of new\npolitical constellations, transformed into an intoxicating,\nrevolutionary experience (SW 2, 210). The possibility of such a\nprofane illumination of nineteenth century Paris, to be presented as\nthe origin of modernity, preoccupied the remaining decade of\nBenjamin\u2019s life, and his research for the monumental and unfinished\n\u201cArcades Project\u201d provides the material from which all his\nremaining work is constructed.\n\n",
