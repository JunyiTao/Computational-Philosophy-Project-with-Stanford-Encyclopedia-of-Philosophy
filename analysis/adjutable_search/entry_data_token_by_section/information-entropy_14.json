    "main_text": "Information Processing Using Statistical Mechanics || Liouvillean proofs\n4.1 Liouvillean proofs\n\n\nSchematically, the simplest of arguments in favour of Landauer's\nprinciple is based directly on volume of phase space arguments and\nLiouville's Theorem.\n\n\n\n\nThe microscopic state space of the system and environment\nis assumed to be divided into logical, or information bearing, degrees\nof freedom and environmental, or non-information bearing degrees of\nfreedom. These can be simplified to just two dimensions. In the figure,\nthe horizontal axis represents the information bearing degrees of\nfreedom. The system being in logical state zero or logical state one\ncorresponds to the microscopic state lying within a particular region\nof the information bearing degree of freedom. The reset to zero\noperation is required to be a Hamiltonian evolution of the state space\nof the system and environment that leaves the system in logical state\nzero, regardless of the initial logical state.\n\n\nAs the region of the state space available to the logical degrees of\nfreedom is reduced by a factor of two, Liouville's Theorem requires\nthat the region of state space available to the environmental degrees\nof freedom must have doubled. It is then argued that this must involve\nheat generation in the environment. This last step requires a little\njustification. In the Boltzmannian approach, the temperature of a\nmacrostate is generally defined by the formula\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2202SB\n\u00a0\nV\n=\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a01\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0.\n\n\n\u2202E\nT\n\n\n\n\n If this system is very large, it is assumed\nthat its temperature undergoes negligible changes from the absorption\nof small quantities of heat. It follows that if the physical volume is\nkept fixed, so that the only change in energy is through heating, then\nthe heat and entropy are related by\n \u0394Q = T\u2009\u0394SB.\n Systems that satisfy these conditions may be considered to be good\nheat baths. A doubling in phase volume of the heat bath implies an\nincrease in Boltzmann entropy of k\u2009ln\u20092, so\nrequires heat absorption\nof kT\u2009ln\u20092.\n\n\nAlthough this simple argument seems compelling, doubts may easily be\nraised. The representation of the logical states and the environment is\nso simplified that it should at least raise concerns as to what may\nhave been lost in this simplification. Shenker (2000) and Hemmo and\nShenker (2007) raise a number of such issues, as part of their\narguments over the existence of a demon. There seems no reason to\nrequire the environment to absorb heat, or even be in a macrostate\nwhich has twice the phase volume. Instead, it could be in one of two\ndistinct regions, corresponding to macroscopically distinct, but\notherwise quite unimportant, degrees of freedom (such as the location\nof a shoe dropped on the floor). All that is required is that the\nenvironmental degrees of freedom must end in one of a number of\ndistinct macrostates, whose total phase volume over all\npossible macrostates must be twice that of the its original macrostate.\nThe use of an \u2018erasure by destruction\u2019 operation can then ensure that\nthe specific macrostates have no trace of the original information.\n\n\nHowever, as noted above in Section 3.6, Hemmo and Shenker\nacknowledge that some tighter formulations of Landauer's principle\nexist that prevent this kind of move (although they question the\nreasonableness of these formulations): if one requires that the\nresetting operation leaves unchanged the macrostate of any\nenvironmental degree of freedom that is not a heat bath, then the\nLiouvillean argument seems to hold.\n",
