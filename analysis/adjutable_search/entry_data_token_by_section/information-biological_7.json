    "main_text": "Genetic programs\n8. Information and evolution\nInformation has also become a focus of general discussion of\nevolutionary processes, especially as they relate to the mechanisms of\ninheritance. One strand of this discussion misconceives information\nand its role in biological processes. In particular, G.C.  Williams\nargues that, via reflection on the role of genes in evolution, we can\ninfer that there is an informational \u201cdomain\u201d that exists\nalongside the physical domain of matter and energy (Williams\n1992). Richard Dawkins defends a similar view, arguing that the\nlong-term path of evolution is made up of gradual changes in inherited\ninformation\u2014as a river that \u201cflows through time, not\nspace\u201d (Dawkins 1995: 4). This is an extension of a more common\nidea, that there exists such things as \u201cinformational\ngenes\u201d that should be understood as distinct from the\n\u201cmaterial genes\u201d that are made of DNA and localized in\nspace and time (Haig 1997). It is a mistake to think that there are\ntwo different things; that there is both a physical entity\u2014a\nstring of bases\u2014and an informational entity, a message. It is\ntrue that for evolutionary (and many other) purposes genes are often\nbest thought of in terms of their base sequence (the sequence of C, A,\nT and G), not in terms of their full set of material properties. This\nway of thinking is essentially a piece of abstraction (Griesemer\n2005). We rightly ignore some properties of DNA and focus on\nothers. But it is a mistake to treat this abstraction as an extra\nentity, with mysterious relations to the physical domain.\nOther ways of linking informational ideas to general issues in\nevolutionary theory seem more promising. As John Maynard Smith, Eors\nSzathm\u00e1ry, Mark Ridley and Richard Dawkins have emphasized in\ndifferent ways, inheritance mechanisms that give rise to significant\nevolutionary outcomes must satisfy some rather special conditions\n(Dawkins 1995; Jablonka and Szathm\u00e1ry 1995; Szathm\u00e1ry and Maynard\nSmith 1997; Ridley 2000). Maynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry claim, for\nexample, that the inheritance system must be unlimited or\n\u201cindefinite\u201d in its capacity to produce new combinations,\nbut must also maintain high fidelity of transmission. This fact about\nthe relationship between inheritance systems and biological structure\nis often thought to reveal one of the most pressing problems in\nexplaining the origins of life. If reproduction depends on the\nreplication of a crucial set of ingredients to kick-start the new\ngeneration (whether or not we think of those ingredients as\ninstructions), these ingredients must be replicated accurately. Yet\naccurate replication apparently depends on complex molecular and\nintracellular machinery that itself is the result of a long regime of\nadaptive evolution, and hence on deep lineages of living systems. So\nhow could reproduction have begun? (see Ridley 2000 for a thoughtful\ndiscussion).\nSo life itself, the argument goes, depends on the evolution of\nmechanisms that support a high fidelity flow of information from one\ngeneration to the next. More ambitiously still, Maynard Smith and\nSzathm\u00e1ry argue that many of the crucial steps in the last four\nbillion years of evolution\u2014their \u201cmajor transitions in\nevolution\u201d\u2014involve the creation of new ways of\ntransmitting information across generations\u2014more reliable, more\nfine-grained, and more powerful ways of making possible the reliable\nre-creation of form across events of biological reproduction. The\ntransition to a DNA-based inheritance system (probably from a system\nbased on RNA) is one central example. But Maynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry\nsuggest that the transition from great ape forms of social life to\nhuman social life is a major transition, in part because of the novel\nforms of large scale cooperation that typify human social life, but\nmostly because they see human language as a breakthrough informational\ntechnology, revolutionising the possibilities of high fidelity\nintergenerational cultural learning (MacArthur 1958; Maynard Smith and\nSzathm\u00e1ry 1995, 1999).\nMaynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry\u2019s work on major transitions has been a\nlandmark in macroevolutionary thinking\u2014in thinking about large\nscale patterns in the history of life. But the informational dimension\nof their work has not been taken up. A minor exception is Sterelny\n(2009). This paper argued that multicelled animal life depended not\njust on the transmission of more information with high fidelity, but\non the control of that information in development, suggesting that the\nevolution of the egg\u2014a controlled, structured, information-rich\ndevelopmental environment\u2014was critical to complex animal\nlife. But most focus has been on the other strand of their work on\nmajor transitions: on the solution of cooperation problems that then\nallow previously independent agents to combine into new, more complex\nagents. Thus in Calcott and Sterelny (2011), none of the papers\nfocused primarily on the expansion or control of intergenerational\ninformation flow. That may change. The evolutionarily crucial features\nof inheritance mechanisms are often now discussed in informational\nterms, and the combinatorial structure seen in both language and DNA\nprovides a powerful basis for analogical reasoning.\n",
