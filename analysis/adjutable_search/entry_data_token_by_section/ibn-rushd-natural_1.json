    "main_text": "Four Causes and Three Principles\n2. Four Causes and Three Principles\n\nAristotle stated the four causes\u2014form, agent, purpose, and\nmatter\u2014but he also added three principles, form, matter and\nprivation in Phys. I.7\u20139. In 190a13\u201321 Aristotle\nstressed that in all cases of coming-to-be there must be something\nthat underlies change, Averroes extensively comments on the need for a\nsubstrate and observes:\n\n\nAristotle and all the Ancients agree that nothing comes to be out of\nnothing, and I have seen some colleagues (socii) doubting on\nthis question, but I entered into this in the treatise On the\nSubstance of the Universe to some extent (LC 36E TC60).\n\n\nThe treatise On the Substance of the Universe is not extant\nin Arabic, but the Latin and the Hebrew translations are, as A. Hyman\nexplains (Hyman 1986, 13\u201315). Averroes reminds that\n\u201cmodern thinkers\u201d, i.e., Muslim theologians, have been\ninsisting that coming-to-be does take place out of nothing because of\nthe \u2018custom\u2019 of saying it again and again, and bad\n\u2018custom\u2019 has destructive effects. These theologians\ncontend that one who first learns philosophy is then not capable of\nlearning the religious law and that the other sciences are hidden to\none who has learned the Shar\u012b\u02bba (LC 36F TC60). Since\nAverroes\u2019 colleagues hesitate, he wants to clear up their doubts\nand wants to comment on Aristotle\u2019s arguments. Phys.\n190b5\u201310 describes the various ways of generation and concludes\nthat all need a substratum, an underlying matter. Averroes who\nexplains that the logical procedure followed here by Aristotle is\ninduction\u2014reasoning from the particular to the\ngeneral\u2014concludes: \u201cIt is clear that coming-to-be\nnecessarily requires a subject not only in natural but also in\nartificial things\u201d (LC 37L TC63). This subject is numerically\none and does not have any substantial characteristic\n(dispositio) but can receive all kinds of substantial\ncharacteristics:\n\n\nIt is called first matter, and first hyle, and it is evident\nthat this matter is\n <not>[2]\n deprived of corporeity because if it was, it would have a substantial\nnature, a name, and a definition. From this it appears that he who\naffirms that this nature (sic, natura) is a body, is wrong,\nand he is likewise wrong who establishes that which has dimensions as\na subject possessing form in actuality, as Avicenna believes (LC 38D\nTC63).\n\n\nNo doubt Averroes is referring to the \u201ccorporeal form\u201d of\nAvicenna. Since Prime Matter is a metaphysical notion and as such\nnothing empirically verifiable, questions arose about its kind of\nexistence. The Greek commentators developed the concept of corporeal\nform, which Avicenna maintains mainly in his physics. The corporeal\nform, \u1e63\u016bra jism\u012bya, invests Prime Matter with\ncorporeality and dimensions. Averroes, however, considers corporeality\nan attribute, not a form (SC 14: 10\u201311) and here in the LC he\nrejects the doctrine of the corporeal form.\n\nThe LC is concerned with the distinction between Prime Matter and\nprivation. The bronze, matter, can become the statue, form, because it\nis not the statue and this negation is a third principle. Aristotle\ndistinguished between absolute non-being and accidental not-being, and\nso matter is non-being accidentally, while privation is not-being\nper se (Phys. I.9, 191b34\u2013192a5). In his\ninterpretation of the Aristotelian passage, Averroes points to the\nprivation of form as the nature of matter. Prime Matter is\n\u201calmost composed of being and not-being\u201d (LC 45C TC80).\nBecause of the presence of not-being in material beings, coming-to-be\nand passing-away is possible in them but not in heavenly bodies which\ndo not have matter, \u201cas was explained in the treatise On the\nsubstance of the universe\u201d (LC 45CD).\n\nThe Middle Commentary also deals with privation (MC 439K\u2013440I;\nMC Kalonymos L 13v\u00ba\u201315r\u00ba) and insists on privation\nbeing a principle. Averroes indicates that the nature of Prime Matter\nis different from that of privation\n\n\nfor privation does not belong to the nature of coming-to-be in such a\nway that it becomes part of the generated thing but it is only some\naccident to the subject which is a [constituent] part of the generated\nthing. But it is necessary for coming-to-be and therefore, it is\naccidentally called principle. (MC 440E; MC Kalonymos L\n14v\u00ba7\u20139)\n\n\nIncidentally, it should be observed that in the SC Prime Matter is\nseen as containing all forms \u201cin potentiality and\npossibility\u201d (SC 15:7). The distinction between\nq\u016bwa and imk\u0101n is not explicitly present\nin Aristotle, where we only read kata dynamin in the related\ntext (Phys. 192a26), although he sketches the distinction in\nsome passages of Metaphysics IX. However, the distinction is\nwell known to Avicenna. In his Shif\u0101\u2019,\nMetaphysics IV.2 (Avicenna, Metaphysics, IV.2,\n130\u2013143), Avicenna explains the notions of potentiality and\npossibility in detail; Avempace also makes the distinction in his\ncommentary on the Physics (Avempace [SST], 28: 21\u201330,\n10). The LC and the MC do not refer to the distinction, and the\nabsence may be explained because Avempace\u2019s influence loses\nweight in Averroes\u2019 later \n  stages.[3]\n",
