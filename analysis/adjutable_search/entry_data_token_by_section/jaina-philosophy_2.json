    "main_text": "Ethics of renunciation: from self-sacrifice to non-violence and omniscience || The categories of reality\n1.3 The categories of reality\n\nThe Treatise on What There Is\n(Tattv\u0101rthas\u016btra, TS), associated with the name of\nUm\u0101sv\u0101min and probably written by multiple authors around\n150\u2013400 CE, is traditionally considered as the first work and\nmain representative of classical Jaina philosophy. It is the oldest\nextant Jaina treatise in Sanskrit. It aims to integrate themes tackled\nin canonical literature in a coherent philosophical system. The\nTreatise on what there is, opens with the following\nverses:\n\n\nTS 1.1. The path to liberation is constituted by right view\n(dar\u015bana), right knowledge, and right conduct.\nTS 1.2. Right view is confidence in the categories.\nTS 1.4. The categories are self, non-self, inflow [of karmic\nmatter], bondage [with karmic matter], stoppage [of the inflow],\ndestruction [of the bondage], liberation.\nTS 5.1. The inanimate entities (= non-self) are medium of motion\n(dharma), medium of rest, space and matter.\nTS 5.2. [These] together with the selves are the substances.\nTS 5.38. (exists only in some textual traditions). Time is also a\nsubstance.\n\n\n\nSo, there are seven categories and six types of substance. The first\ncategory consists in selves, which are a type of substance, while the\nsecond category, the non-self stuff, encompasses the five remaining\ntypes of substance. These two categories will be dealt with in more\ndepth in the section on metaphysics\n (\u00a72.1).\n Next to these, are the inflow of harmful and harmless karmic matter\ninto a sentient substance (\u0101srava); the mutual\nintermingling of sentient and non-sentient karmic matter caused by\nwrong belief, non-renunciation, carelessness, passions and vibrations\nset in the soul through mind, body and speech (bandha); the\nstoppage of the inflow of karmic matter into a sentient substance that\nresults from right conduct (sa\u1e43vara); the gradual\ndissociation of karmic matter from a sentient substance\n(nirjar\u0101); and the state of complete annihilation of\nkarmic matter in the pure sentient substance (mok\u1e63a).\nFor this section on ethics, what is important to keep in mind is that\nfive out of the seven elementary categories are not ontological ones,\nbut define the way by means of which the self, which is primarily\nactive consciousness, relates to things which are not conscious and\npassive.\n\nFirst, this means that the categories relevant in this metaphysics are\nintroduced inasmuch as a good understanding of their nature is\nessential in characterizing the practice that will make one progress\nin the path towards liberation.\n\nSecond,\n\n\nthese categories (tattva) are essentially \u201cfacts\u201d\nabout the nature of existence which enable those who analyse them\nproperly to plot their route to liberation. (Johnson 2014)\n\n\nAs such, there is an inbuilt soteriological concern of Jaina ontology\nand metaphysics.\n\nThird, the core categorical differentiation distinguishes between what\nis animate and conscious and what is not. Such an impermeable\ndistinction is especially essential in a conception in which one needs\nto be able to know precisely how much her acts are correct,\nrespectively incorrect, because the harm done to others binds her.\nThis was an important part of the discussions concerning monastic\npractices.\n",
