    "main_text": "Meritocratic Justice || Justification\n4.1 Justification\n\nWhile not endorsing it, Swift and Marshall previewed the principal\nanswer to that question: In a meritocracy, people get what they\ndeserve. And because, it is argued, justice is giving people what they\ndeserve, meritocracy is just. Meritocrats thus follow in the\nAristotelian tradition\n (\u00a71)\n of seeking to match social goods, like jobs and income, with facts\nabout the people who desire them, like their qualifications or\neconomic contributions.\n\nLike desert-based approaches to justice broadly, meritocracy has not\nbeen popular within contemporary philosophy. But there have been\ndefenders. David Miller (1999) gives \u201ctwo cheers\u201d to the\n ideal.[3]\n This qualification is rooted in Miller\u2019s pluralistic\nview of justice. He identifies three \u201cmodes of human\ninteraction\u201d, with desert (meritocracy) governing one of them\n(viz. \u201cinstrumental association\u201d). (Principles of\nequality and need govern the other two.)\n\nMiller appeals to Aristotelian proportional equality\n (\u00a71)\n to ground the desertist portion of his theory. Understanding\n\u201cmerit\u201d as social contribution, he argues that a just\nsociety rewards people in proportion to their contributions (or, in\nthe case of jobs, the qualities that will enable them to make\ncontributions).\n\n\nHiring by merit is the policy that in general brings about the closest\ncorrespondence between individuals\u2019 contributions and their\nrewards\u2026. Nepotism or discrimination is unfair because it\npredictably creates a state of affairs in which there is a discrepancy\nbetween deserts and income rewards. Moreover, the best-qualified\ncandidate who is passed over can legitimately complain that she is the\nvictim of an injustice through being prevented from earning rewards\ncommensurate with her potential contribution. (Miller 1999: 166)\n\n\nMulligan\u2019s (2018b) meritocratic theory of justice is, in\ncontrast to Miller\u2019s, monistic. That is, Mulligan\nclaims that justice is a matter of desert, and only a matter of\ndesert. And doing justice to people\u2014giving them what they\ndeserve\u2014is about establishing equal opportunity and judging them\non their merits alone.\n\nMulligan advances several justifications for meritocracy, but most\nsalient is meritocracy\u2019s intuitive appeal. People feel\nthat meritocratic distribution is just, and this sentiment appears\nstable across race, gender, socioeconomic class, political persuasion,\nand culture (cf.\n \u00a76).\n The research adduced comes from equity theory\n (\u00a71),\n experimental economics (e.g., Alm\u00e5s, Cappelen, & Tungodden\n2020; Cappelen, S\u00f8rensen, & Tungodden 2010; Frohlich,\nOppenheimer, & Kurki 2004), the child development literature\n(Baumard, Mascaro, & Chevallier 2012; Kanngiesser & Warneken\n2012; Sloane, Baillargeon, & Premack 2014), evolutionary\npsychology (Aar\u00f8e & Petersen 2014; Baumard, Andr\u00e9,\n& Sperber 2013; Petersen 2012), neuroeconomics (Cappelen, Eichele,\net al. 2014; Vostroknutov, Tobler, & Rustichini 2012), and other\nfields of empirical study.\n\nOther justifications for meritocratic norms have been given,\nindependent of comprehensive theories of justice. George Sher (1987)\ngives one which is grounded in autonomy (sometimes put in\nterms of respect or dignity). When we distribute a\nscarce good on the basis of merit, we appeal only to attributes which\nconstitute persons, and in particular those persons who are competing\nfor the good. These attributes include skills, talents, and\npreferences. Meritocratic distribution thus provides people maximal\ncontrol over their lives (or shows them maximal respect/dignity).\n\n\nWhen we hire by merit, we abstract from all facts about the applicants\nexcept their ability to perform well at the relevant tasks\u2026. We\ntreat them as agents whose purposeful acts can make a difference in\nthe world\u2026. Selecting by merit is a way of taking seriously the\npotential agency of both the successful and the unsuccessful\napplicants. (Sher 1987: 121)\n\n\n(See also Mason 2006 and Varga 2016. Dobos 2016 provides an overview\nof justifications for merit-based hiring.)\n\nAnother idea is that the social good itself\u2014its very\nnature\u2014points to merit as the morally proper basis for\ndistribution. This Aristotelian notion\n (\u00a71)\n is today more commonly put in terms of \u201cfittingness\u201d or\n\u201crelevant qualifications\u201d.\n\nThe idea may be elaborated in conceptual terms (see Sher 1987 and\nWilliams 1973). It is morally fitting to give the job at the widget\nfactory to the applicant who is best at making widgets, a fact which\nmay be discerned from the concept of widget-making (cf. Williams:\n\u201cThe proper ground of distribution of medical care is ill\nhealth: this is a necessary truth\u201d [1973: 240]).\n\nPut differently, there is a conceptual connection between social goods\nand merit. There is no such connection between social goods and the\nother commonly-cited grounds for distribution, such as maximizing\nproductivity or treating people equally. While in those cases\nconnections doubtless exist and may seem weighty, they are external.\nThey do not participate in our understanding of the social good\nitself.\n\nThe fittingness of merit-based distribution might be regarded as\nprimitive and thus neither in need of nor amenable to further\njustification. As Joel Feinberg puts it,\n\n\nI am not sure how, if at all, these judgments of moral appropriateness\nare to be verified; but I suspect that they resemble certain aesthetic\njudgments\u2014for example that crimson and orange are clashing\ncolors. (1963: 92)\n\n",
