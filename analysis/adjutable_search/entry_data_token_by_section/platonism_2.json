    "main_text": "The One Over Many Argument\n3. The One Over Many Argument\n\nThere are two mainstream arguments for platonism. The first, which\ngoes back to Plato, is an argument for the existence of properties and\nrelations only; this is the One Over Many argument. The\nsecond is also present in some sense in the works of Plato (at least\non some readings of those works), but its first modern formulation,\nand certainly the first clear formulation, was given by Frege\n(1884, 1892, 1893\u20131903, 1919); I will call this the singular\nterm argument, and unlike the One Over Many, it can be used in\nconnection with all the different kinds of abstract objects, i.e.,\nnumbers, properties, propositions, and so on. In the present section,\nwe will discuss the One Over Many argument, and in the next section,\nwe will discuss the singular term argument.\n\nThe One Over Many argument can be formulated as follows:\n\nI have in front of me three red objects (say a ball, a hat, and a\nrose). These objects resemble one another. Therefore, they have\nsomething in common. What they have in common is clearly a property,\nnamely, redness; therefore, redness exists.\n\n\nWe can think of this argument as an inference to the best explanation.\nThere is a fact that requires explanation, namely, that the three\nobjects resemble each other. The explanation is that they all possess\na single property, namely, redness. Thus, platonists argue, if there\nis no other explanation of this fact (i.e., the fact of resemblance)\nthat is as good as their explanation (i.e., the one that appeals to\nproperties), then we are justified in believing in properties.\n\nNotice that as the argument has been stated here, it is not an\nargument for a platonistic view of properties; it is an argument for\nthe thesis that properties exist, but not for the thesis that\nproperties are abstract objects. Thus, in order to use this argument\nto motivate platonism, one would have to supplement it with some\nreason for thinking that the properties in question here could not be\nideas in our heads or immanent properties existing in particular\nphysical objects. There are a number of arguments that one might use\nhere, and in\n section 4.3,\n we will discuss some of these. But there is no need to pursue this\nhere, because there is good reason to think that the One Over Many\nargument doesn't succeed anyway \u2014 i.e., that it doesn't provide\na good reason for believing in properties of any sort. In other words,\nthe One Over Many argument fails to refute nominalism about\nproperties.\n\nBefore proceeding, it is worth pointing out that the One Over Many\nargument described above can be simplified. As Michael Devitt (1980)\npoints out, the appeal to resemblance, or to multiple things\nhaving a given property, is a red herring. On the traditional\nformulation, nominalists are challenged to account for the following\nfact: the ball is red and the hat is red. But if nominalists can\naccount for the fact that the ball is red, then presumably, they can\nsimply repeat the same sort of explanation in connection with the hat,\nand they will have accounted for the fact that both things are red.\nThus, the real challenge for the nominalist is to explain simple\npredicative facts, e.g., the fact that the ball is red, without\nappealing to properties, e.g., redness. More generally, they need to\nshow how we can account for the truth of sentences of the form\n\u2018a is F\u2019 without appealing to a property\nof\n Fness.[2]\n\n(One might also think of the argument as asking not for an explanation\nof the fact that, say, Mars is red, but rather for an account of what\nit is about the world that makes the sentence \u2018Mars is\nred\u2019 true. See Peacock (2009) in this regard.)\n\nThere is a very well-known nominalist response to the One Over Many\nargument. The heart of the response is captured by the following\nremark from Quine (1948, p. 10):\n\nThat the houses and roses and sunsets are all of them red may be taken\nas ultimate and irreducible, and it may be held that...[the platonist]\nis no better off, in point of real explanatory power, for all the\noccult entities which he posits under such names as\n\u2018redness\u2019.\n\n\nThere are two different ideas here. The first is that nominalists can\nrespond to the One Over Many with an appeal to irreducible facts, or\nbrute facts. The second is that platonists are no better off\nthan such brute-fact nominalists in terms of real explanatory power.\nNow, Quine didn't say very much about these two ideas, but both ideas\nhave been developed by Devitt (1980, 2010), whose exposition we follow\nhere.\n\nThe challenge to nominalists is to provide an explanation of facts of\na certain kind, namely, predicative facts expressed by sentences of\nthe form \u2018a is F\u2019, e.g., the fact that a\ngiven ball is red. Now, whenever we are challenged to provide an\nexplanation of a fact, or alleged fact, we have a number options. The\nmost obvious response is simply to provide the requested explanation.\nBut we can also argue that the alleged fact isn't really a fact at\nall. Or, third, we can argue that the fact in question is a\nbrute fact \u2014 i.e., a fact that does not have an\nexplanation. Now, in the present case, nominalists cannot claim that\nall predicative facts are brute facts, because it is clear that we\ncan explain at least some facts of this sort. For instance,\nit seems that the fact that a given ball is red can be explained very\neasily by saying that it is red because it reflects light in such and\nsuch a way, and that it reflects light in this way because its surface\nis structured in thus and so a manner. So nominalists should not claim\nthat all predicative facts are brute facts. But as Devitt points out,\nthere is a more subtle way to appeal to bruteness here, and if Quinean\nnominalists make use of this, they can block the One Over Many\nargument.\n\nThe Quine-Devitt response to the One Over Many begins with the claim\nthat we can account for the fact that the ball is red, without\nappealing to the property of redness, by simply using whatever\nexplanation scientists give of this fact. Now, by itself, this\nexplanation will not satisfy advocates of the One Over Many argument.\nIf we explain the fact that the ball is red by pointing out that its\nsurface is structured in some specific way, then advocates of the One\nOver Many argument will say that we have only moved the problem back a\nstep, because nominalists will now have to account for the fact that\nthe ball's surface is structured in the given way, and they will have\nto do this without appealing to the property of being structured in\nthe given way. More generally, the point is this: it is of course true\nthat if nominalists are asked to account for the fact that some object\na is F, without appealing to the property of\nFness, they can do this by pointing out that (i) a\nis G and (ii) all Fs are Gs (this is the\nsort of explanation they will get if they borrow their explanations\nfrom scientists); but such explanations only move the problem back a\nstep, for they leave us with the task of having to explain the fact\nthat a is G, and if we want to endorse nominalism,\nwe will have to do this without appealing to the property of\nGness.\n\nThis is where the appeal to bruteness comes in. Nominalists can say\nthat (a) we can keep giving explanations of the above sort (i.e.,\nexplanations of the sort \u2018a is F because it is\nG,\u2019 or because its parts are Gs, Hs,\nand Is, or whatever) for as long as we can, and (b) when\nexplanations of this sort cannot be given, no explanation at all can\nbe given. The thought here is that at this point, we will have arrived\nat fundamental facts that do not admit of explanations \u2014 e.g.,\nfacts about the basic physical natures of elementary particles. When\nwe arrive at facts like this, we will say: \u201cThere's no reason\nwhy these particles are this way; they just are.\u201d\n\nThis gives us a way of understanding how nominalists can plausibly use\nan appeal to bruteness to respond to the One Over Many argument. But\nthe appeal to bruteness is only half of the Quinean remark quoted\nabove. What about the other half, i.e., the part about the platonist\nbeing no better off than brute-fact nominalists in terms of real\nexplanatory power? To appreciate this claim, let us suppose that we\nhave arrived at a bottom-level fact that Quinean nominalists take to\nbe a brute fact (e.g., the fact that physical particles of some\nparticular kind \u2014 say, gluons \u2014 are G). Advocates\nof the One Over Many would say that their view is superior to Quinean\nnominalism because they can provide an explanation of the fact in\nquestion. Now, when they announce this, people who were interested in\nthe question of why gluons are G, and who had been\ndisappointed to hear from scientists and Quineans that this is simply\na brute fact, might get very excited and listen eagerly to what\nadvocates of the One Over Many have to say. What they say is this:\n\nGluons are G because they possess the property of\nGness.\n\n\nThis doesn't seem very helpful. The claim that gluons possess\nGness seems to do little more than tell us that gluons have\nsome nature that makes it the case that they are G, and so it\nseems that no genuine explanation has been given. After all, those who\nhad been interested in learning why gluons are G would not be\nvery satisfied by this so-called \u201cexplanation\u201d. Thus, to\nuse Quine's words, it seems that advocates of the One Over Many are\n\u201cno better off, in point of real explanatory power\u201d than\nbrute-fact nominalists are.\n\nNominalists might try to push the argument a bit further here,\nclaiming that the sentence\n\n(P) Gluons possesses the property of Gness\n\n\nis just a paraphrase of the sentence\n\n(N) Gluons are G.\n\n\nOn this view, (P) is equivalent to (N). That is, it says the\nvery same thing. And neither sentence, according to this view, entails\nthe existence of Gness. We can call this a\nparaphrase-nominalist view of sentences like (P). But\nnominalists needn't endorse this view. They can also endorse a\nfictionalist view of sentences like (P). On this view, (P)\nand (N) do not, strictly speaking, say the same thing, because (P)\ntalks about the property of Gness and (N) does not. According\nto this fictionalist view, (P) is strictly speaking untrue, because it\ntalks about the property of Gness, and according to\nnominalism, there is no such thing as Gness. In short, (P) is\nstrictly speaking untrue, on this view, for the same reason that,\ne.g., \u2018The tooth fairy is nice\u2019 is untrue. But while (P)\nis not literally true on this view, it is\n\u201cfor-all-practical-purposes true\u201d, or some such thing,\nbecause colloquially, it can be used to say what (N) says literally.\nThis idea is often captured by saying that (P) is just a manner of\nspeaking, or a fa\u00e7on de parler. (Notice that the\ndispute between fictionalism and paraphrase nominalism is best\nunderstood as a straightforward empirical dispute about the\nordinary-language semantics of sentences like (P); the question is\nwhether such utterances literally say the same things that the\ncorresponding sentences like (N) say.)\n\nWhichever view nominalists adopt here, they can respond to the One\nOver Many argument \u2014 i.e., to the claim that we can explain (N)\nby endorsing (P) \u2014 in the same way, namely, by pointing out that\nas an explanation of (N), (P) is completely uninformative. Even if\nnominalists endorse a fictionalist view according to which (P) is not\nequivalent to (N), they can still say that the above explanation is\nuninformative, because it really just says that gluons are G\nbecause they possess a nature that makes it the case that they are\nG.\n\nHaving made the point that the platonist explanation of (N) is\nuninformative, the nominalist's next move is to appeal to Ockham's\nrazor to argue that we shouldn't believe in Gness (or at\nleast that we shouldn't believe in Gness for any reason that\nhas anything to do with the need to explain things like (N)). Ockham's\nrazor is a principle that tells us that we should believe in objects\nof a given kind only if they play a genuine explanatory role. This\nprinciple suggests that if Gness does not play a genuine role\nin an explanation of the fact that gluons are G, then we\nshouldn't believe in Gness \u2014 or, again, we shouldn't\nbelieve in it for any reason having to do with the need to explain the\nfact that gluons are G.\n\nThe Quinean response to the One Over Many argument is often couched in\nterms of a criterion of ontological commitment. A criterion\nof ontological commitment is a principle that tells us when we are\ncommitted to believing in objects of a certain kind in virtue of\nhaving assented to certain sentences. What the above response to the\nOne Over Many suggests is that we are ontologically committed not by\npredicates like \u2018is red\u2019 and \u2018is a rock\u2019, but\nby singular terms. (A singular term is just a denoting\nphrase, i.e., an expression that purports to refer to a specific\nobject, e.g., proper names like \u2018Mars\u2019 and\n\u2018Clinton\u2019, certain uses of pronouns like\n\u2018she\u2019, and on some views, definite descriptions like\n\u2018the oldest U.S. senator\u2019.) More specifically, the idea\nhere seems to be this: if you think that a sentence of the form\n\u2018a is F\u2019 is true, then you have to\naccept the existence of the object a, but you do not have to\naccept the existence of a property of Fness; for instance, if\nyou think that \u2018The ball is red\u2019 is true, then you have to\nbelieve in the ball, but you do not have to believe in redness; or if\nyou think that \u2018Fido is a dog\u2019 is true, then you have to\nbelieve in Fido but not in the property of doghood.\n\nThree points need to be made here. First, the above criterion needs to\nbe generalized so that it covers the use of singular terms in other\nkinds of sentences, e.g., sentences of the form \u2018a is\nR-related to b\u2019. Second, on the standard view,\nwe are ontologically committed not just by singular terms but also by\nexistential statements \u2014 e.g., by sentences like \u2018There\nare some Fs\u2019, \u2018There is at least one\nF\u2019, and so on (in first-order logic, such sentences are\nsymbolized as \u2018(\u2203x)Fx\u2019, and the\n\u2018\u2203\u2019 is called an existential quantifier).\nThe standard view here is that if you think that a sentence like this\nis true, then you are committed to believing in the existence of some\nFs (or at least one F) but you do not have to\nbelieve in Fness; for instance, if we assent to \u2018There\nare some dogs\u2019, then we are committed to believing in the\nexistence of some dogs, but we are not thereby committed to believing\nin the existence of the property of doghood. (Quine actually thought\nthat we are committed only by existential claims and not by\nsingular terms; but this is not a widely held view.) Third and\nfinally, it is usually held that we are ontologically committed by\nsingular terms and existential expressions (or existential\nquantifiers) only when they appear in sentences that we think are\nliterally true and only when we think the singular term or\nexistential quantifier in question can't be paraphrased away.\nWe can see what's meant by this by returning to the sentence\n\n(R) The ball possesses the property of redness.\n\n\nIn this sentence, the expression \u2018the property of redness\u2019\nseems to be a singular term \u2014 it seems to denote the\nproperty of redness; thus, using the above criterion of ontological\ncommitment, if we think (R) is true, then it would seem, we are\ncommitted to believing in the property of redness. But there are two\ndifferent responses that nominalists can make to this. First, they can\nendorse paraphrase nominalism (defined a few paragraphs back) with\nrespect to (R). If they do this, they will claim that (R) doesn't\nreally carry an ontological commitment to the property of redness,\nbecause it is really just equivalent to the sentence \u2018The ball\nis red\u2019. This idea is often expressed by saying that in (R), the\nsingular term \u2018the property of redness\u2019 can be\nparaphrased away \u2014 which is just to say that (R) can be\nparaphrased by (or is equivalent to) a sentence that doesn't contain\nthe singular term \u2018the property of redness\u2019 (namely,\n\u2018The ball is red\u2019). The second view that nominalists can\nendorse with respect to (R) is fictionalism. In other words, they can\nadmit that (R) does commit to the existence of the property of\nredness, but they can maintain that because of this (and because there\nare no such things as properties), (R) is, strictly speaking, untrue,\neven if it is \u201cfor-all-practical-purposes true,\u201d or some\nsuch thing.\n\nHaving said all of this, we can summarize by saying that the standard\nview of ontological commitment is as follows:\n\nCriterion of Ontological Commitment: We are ontologically\ncommitted by the singular terms (that can't be paraphrased away) in\nthe (simple) sentences that we take to be literally true; and we are\nontologically committed by the existential quantifiers (that can't be\nparaphrased away) in the (existential) sentences that we take to be\nliterally true; but we are not committed by the predicates in such\nsentences. Thus, for instance, if we believe that a sentence of the\nform \u2018a is F\u2019 is literally true, and if\nwe think that it cannot be paraphrased into some other sentence that\navoids reference to a, then we are committed to believing in\nthe object a but not the property of Fness; and,\nlikewise, if we assent to a sentence of the form \u2018a is\nR-related to b\u2019, then we are committed to\nbelieving in the objects a and b but not the\nrelation R; and if we assent to a sentence of the form\n\u2018There is an F\u2019 then we are committed to\nbelieving in an object that is F but we are not committed to\nthe property of\n Fness.[3]\n\n\nThe One Over Many argument is now widely considered to be a bad\nargument. Ironically, though, the above criterion of ontological\ncommitment \u2014 which Quinean nominalists appeal to in responding\nto the One Over Many argument \u2014 is one of the central premises\nin what is now thought to be the best argument for platonism. We will\ncall this argument the singular term argument, although one\nmight just as well call it the\nsucker-punch-on-the-Quinean-nominalist argument, for as we\nwill see, the strategy is to accept the above criterion of ontological\ncommitment and turn it against the Quinean nominalist.\n",
