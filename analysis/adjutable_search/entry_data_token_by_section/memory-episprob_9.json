    "main_text": "Justification and Beyond || Testimony and Memory\n3.1 Testimony and Memory\n\nMemory may have a special connection to testimony (see entry on\n epistemological problems of testimony).\n There is debate about whether the two have similar epistemic\nfunctions (Burge 1993; Lackey 2005; Malmgren 2006). Supposing they do,\nit is a further question what those functions are. Perhaps neither\ngenerates knowledge or certain other epistemic goods (Audi 1997). It\ncould be that a speaker\u2019s testimony can pass on knowledge to a\nhearer, but cannot create knowledge for the hearer when the speaker\nlacks it. In a way, testimony is not a foundational source of\nknowledge or justification. If preservationism (as anti-generativism)\nis true, memory is not a source either. Or, perhaps both can generate\nknowledge. Or, perhaps memory and testimony simply have distinct\nepistemic functions.\n\nAnother possible connection: memory is a kind of testimony.\nSpecifically, memory may merely be testimony to your current self from\nyour past self. Remembering is like reading your own diary. Your\njustification for believing what you seem to remember depends on your\nbackground justification for trusting your prior judgments and\ntrusting memory to indicate these judgments. This parallels a simple\nview about justification from testimony. Your justification for\nbelieving someone\u2019s testimony depends on your background\njustification for trusting what the testifier believes and trusting\nthis person\u2019s testimony to indicate her beliefs.\n\nThe diary view of memory may be wrong. It fits poorly with cases in\nwhich a subject recalls two beliefs that originally were unequal in\njustification but does not recall her original reasons for these\nbeliefs. The diary view of memory here counts the beliefs as equally\njustified. So it must contend that the reasons for the beliefs have\nchanged, even when it is stipulated that the subject has neither\nlearned nor forgotten anything relevant. The diary view incorrectly\ntreats some testimony from your former self equally (Barnett 2015).\nHere\u2019s another reason to doubt that memory is a kind of\ntestimony. When memory reports p, this is evidence that\np, rather than evidence about what memory reports (Weatherson\n2015). But when a testifier reports p, this isn\u2019t\nevidence that p, but rather evidence about what the testifier\nreports.\n\nIt could be that memory has a special connection to testimony, but one\nthat is problematic. Sometimes a subject experiences an event, and\nafterwards hears misleading testimony about the event. The subject may\nlater incorporate the content of that testimony when constructively\nrecollecting the event, and for that reason form a false belief about\nthe event. This is the much-discussed \u201cmisinformation\neffect\u201d (Loftus 1979 [1996]). Less discussed is the\n\u201cinformation effect\u201d. Here, the subject hears accurate\ntestimony about an event she has witnessed, and that testimony shapes\nhow she later reconstructively recollects the event, leading to a true\nbelief. Although the belief is accurate, it\u2019s accuracy may be\ndue to a kind of luck that prevents knowledge; at best this is a\n\u201cGettier case\u201d (see entry on\n the analysis of knowledge).\n Michaelian (2013) argues that when the information effect occurs, not\nonly does memory\u2019s reliability increase, but knowledge is also\nstill possible. The information effect does not involve\nproblematic luck. According to Shanton (2011), constructive\nrecollection in general is unreliable and leads to false belief in a\nnearby possible world. But she suggests it is more plausible that this\nrecollection can still yield knowledge, than that knowledge requires\neither reliability or no false belief in close worlds.\n",
