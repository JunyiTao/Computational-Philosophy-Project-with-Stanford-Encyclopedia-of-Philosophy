    "main_text": "Double-Consciousness in The Souls of Black Folk || A Deflationist Reading\n2.3 A Deflationist Reading\n\nWhat I\u2019ll call a \u201cdeflationist\u201d interpretation of Du\nBois\u2019s conception is pursued by Adolph Reed, Jr., in his 1997\nbook on Du Bois\u2019s political philosophy, W.E.B. Du Bois and\nAmerican Political Thought: Fabianism and the Color Line.\nReed\u2019s book offers a critique of what he dubs\n\u201cvindicationist\u201d approaches to Afro-American political\nthought \u2013 approaches attempting to show the significance of\nAfrican-American theorists by tracing analogies and connections\nbetween their work and the \u201cgreats\u201d of the (white)\nEuropean tradition (1997: 12). The double polemical thrust of\nReed\u2019s text questions the alleged sources of influence on Du\nBois\u2019s thinking, and rejects the claim that Du Boisian\ndouble-consciousness refers to a transhistorical feature of black life\nin America. He points to the disappearance of the term from Du\nBois\u2019s texts after 1903 to undercut the claims that it\n\u201cwas a definitive element, a key organizing principle of his\nthought\u201d or \u201ca moment in a distinctively black\nsocial-theoretical discourse or tradition\u201d (1997: 124). Reed\nconcludes that the claim\n\nthat millions of individuals experience a peculiar form of bifurcated\nidentity, simply by virtue of common racial status\u2026 seems\npreposterous on its face. (1997: 125)\n\n\nSetting out a contextualizing account, Reed shows the considerable\ncachet of ideas of duality current when Du Bois wrote, and argues that\nthe claims connecting Du Bois\u2019s use of double-consciousness to\nEmerson, James or Hegel fail. Reed aligns Du Bois\u2019s concept with\nevolutionary and Lamarckian social-scientific views instead. He argues\nthat an emphasis on double-consciousness emerges in Du Bois\ninterpretation only after the 1960s, when it supplants critical\nattention to the critique of Booker T. Washington\u2019s strategy of\n\u201caccommodation\u201d in the third essay of the book. Reed\nattributes this shift in focus to \u201can ideological current within\nthe post-segregation-era black petite bourgeoisie\u201d (1997: 130)\n\u201ccentered on assertion of black presence within hermetically\nconstituted communities of academic discourse\u201d (1997:\n94\u20135).\n\nErnest Allen Jr. presents a similarly deflationist case in his\narticle, \u201cDu Boisian Double Consciousness: The Unsustainable\nArgument\u201d (2002), arguing that the Du Boisian conception of\ndouble-consciousness was a \u201ctactical, political\u201d attempt\nto gain support among sympathetic white philanthropists for the\nefforts of cultural uplift and organization on the part of a\n\u201cTalented Tenth\u201d, an \u201ceducated black elite\u201d.\nThe rhetorical construction of a model of double-consciousness in\nSouls involves for Allen a \u201cdouble sleight of\nhand\u201d (2002: 25), requiring a slippage between a putative\nconflict of ideals within the minds of the black elite and a more\ngeneral problem for African Americans \u201cwho could not help but\nhave internalized some of the negative sentiments that white society\nheld towards them\u201d (2002: 29).\n\nThe attribution of distinctive \u201cAmerican\u201d and\n\u201cNegro\u201d ideals is empty, Allen argues: there are no clear\nexamples of \u201cNegro\u201d ideals in the offing in Du\nBois\u2019s text. Though there is no conflict between\n\u201cwarring\u201d ideals as claimed by Du Bois, there is\na conflict between white racial prejudice, intransigent hostility and\nexclusion of blacks, on the one hand, and the ideal of civic equality\nfor all emblazoned on the ideological banners of the American\nrepublic, on the other. This \u2013 what Allen calls \u201cthe\ninstitutionalized as well as everyday double consciousness and double\ndealings of white Americans\u201d \u2013 is, he claims, \u201cthe\nsocial foundation\u201d of the \u201cAfrican American ideological\nambivalence\u201d (2002: 38) that Du Boisian double-consciousness\nexpresses.\n",
