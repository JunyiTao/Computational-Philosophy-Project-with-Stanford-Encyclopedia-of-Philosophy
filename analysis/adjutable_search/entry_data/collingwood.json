    "preamble": "\n\nR. G. Collingwood (1889\u20131943) was a British philosopher and\npractising archaeologist best known for his work in aesthetics and the\nphilosophy of history. During the 1950s and 1960s his philosophy of\nhistory, in particular, occupied centre stage in the debate concerning\nthe nature of explanation in the social sciences and whether or not\nthey are ultimately reducible to explanations in the natural sciences.\nPrimarily through the interpretative efforts of W. H. Dray,\nCollingwood\u2019s work in the philosophy of history came to be seen\nas providing a powerful antidote against Carl Hempel\u2019s claim for\nmethodological unity.\n\nCollingwood is the author of two of the most important treatises in\nmeta-philosophy written in the first half of the twentieth century,\nAn Essay on Philosophical Method (1933), and An Essay on\nMetaphysics (1940). They both contain a sustained discussion of\nthe role and character of philosophical analysis and why the method of\nphilosophy is distinct from and irreducible to the methods of the\nnatural and the exact sciences.\n\nHe is often described as one of the British Idealists, although the\nlabel fails to capture his distinctive kind of idealism, which is\nconceptual rather than metaphysical. In his correspondence with\nGilbert Ryle, Collingwood himself explicitly rejected the label\n\u201cidealist\u201d because he did not endorse the arch-rationalist\nassumptions that shaped much British idealism at the end of the\nnineteenth and the early part of the twentieth century and\nconsequently did not wish to be identified with it.\n\nFrom the mid-thirties onwards Collingwood\u2019s work increasingly\nengaged in a dialogue with the newly emerging school of analytic\nphilosophy. In An Essay on Metaphysics (1940) he attacked the\nneo-empiricist assumptions prevalent in early analytic philosophy and\nadvocated a logical transformation of metaphysics from a study of\nbeing or ontology to a study of the absolute presuppositions or\nheuristic principles which govern different forms of enquiry.\nCollingwood thus occupies a distinctive position in the history of\nBritish philosophy in the first half of the twentieth century. He\nrejects equally the neo-empiricist assumptions that prevailed in early\nanalytic philosophy and the kind of metaphysics that the analytical\nschool sought to overthrow. His logical reform of metaphysics also\nensures a distinctive role and subject matter for philosophical\nenquiry and is thus far from advocating a merely therapeutic\nconception of philosophy or the dissolution of philosophical into\nlinguistic analysis in the manner of ordinary language philosophy.\n\nSee the separate entry for a discussion of\n Collingwood\u2019s aesthetics.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nR.G. Collingwood was born in 1889 at Cartmel Fell, Lancashire, at the\nsouthern tip of Windermere. His father, W.G. Collingwood, was an\narchaeologist, artist, and acted as John Ruskin\u2019s private\nsecretary in the final years of Ruskin\u2019s life; his mother was\nalso an artist and a talented pianist. When he was two years old the\nfamily moved to Lanehead, on the shore of Coniston Water, close to\nRuskin\u2019s house at Brantwood.\n\nCollingwood was taught at home until the age of thirteen when he went\nto preparatory school and the following year to Rugby School. In 1908\nhe went up to University College, Oxford, to read Literae\nHumaniores. He was elected as a Fellow of Pembroke College,\nOxford, while still taking his final examinations.\n\nOn beginning his philosophical studies in 1910 he came under the\ninfluence of the Oxford realists, especially E.F. Carritt and John\nCook Wilson. Until around 1916 he was a professed realist; however,\nhis realism was progressively undermined by his close engagement with\ncontinental philosophy, especially the work of Benedetto Croce and\nGiovanni Gentile. This was partly the result of his friendship with\nJ.A. Smith, Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy from 1910\nto 1935. In 1913 he published an English translation of Croce\u2019s\nThe Philosophy of Giambattista Vico; he was later to\ntranslate many other works by both Croce and Guido de Ruggiero. Both\nCroce and de Ruggiero were personal as well as philosophical friends,\nalthough his relationship with de Ruggiero was closer.\n\nMuch of Collingwood\u2019s early work was in theology and the\nphilosophy of religion, under the influence of \u201cThe Group\u201d\nor \u201cCumnor Circle\u201d, a gathering of Church of England\nmodernists. In 1916 he published an essay on \u201cThe Devil\u201d\nin a collection produced by this group, and also his first book\nReligion and Philosophy.\n\nAt the same time Collingwood was engaged in practical archaeological\nwork, spending his summers from 1912 onwards directing excavations of\nRoman sites in the north of England. Although he sometimes described\nhis archaeology as a hobby, he nonetheless became an authority on the\nhistory and archaeology of Roman Britain, conducting many excavations,\nwriting hundreds of papers, and systematically working his way around\nthe country recording and transcribing Roman inscriptions.\n\nDuring the First World War Collingwood applied for a commission in the\narmy but was rejected because of his poor eyesight. Having been a keen\ncadet at Rugby School and an enthusiast for the National Service\nLeague, this came as a blow. From January 1916 onwards Collingwood\nspent most of his time living and working in London in the\nIntelligence Section of the Admiralty; although he continued to see\npupils in Oxford weekly, he gave no lectures between 1916 and 1919. He\nleft the Admiralty in June 1919 and resumed lecturing in January 1920.\nDuring his time at the Admiralty he was the main author of two book\nlength reports: A Manual of Belgium and the Adjoining\nTerritories (1918); and A Manual of Alsace-Lorraine\n(1919). A spin off from this work was his entry on Luxemburg\nin the Encyclopaedia Britannica (12th ed.,\n1921).\n\nIn late 1919 Collingwood wrote an extensive survey of the history of\nthe ontological proof, together with an analysis of the argument. This\nsurvey was given as a series of lectures in the early 1920s. He drew\non this material in some of his later work, especially in Faith\nand Reason (1928), An Essay on Philosophical Method\n(1933) and An Essay on Metaphysics (1940). In 1924\nCollingwood wrote Speculum Mentis. This was a dialectic of\nwhat he termed \u201cforms of experience\u201d: art, religion,\nscience, history, and philosophy. During this period he was also\nlecturing on ethics, Roman history, the philosophy of history, and\naesthetics: his Outlines of a Philosophy of Art (based on his\nlectures) was published in 1925.\n\nThroughout the 1920s and early 1930s Collingwood was also heavily\nengaged in historical and archaeological work, publishing The\nArchaeology of Roman Britain in 1930 and several editions of\nRoman Britain. The culmination of this work was his survey of\nRoman Britain in Roman Britain and the English Settlements\n(1936) and his contribution to Tenney Frank\u2019s Economic\nSurvey of Ancient Rome (1937). To add to his self-imposed burden\nof overwork, his abilities as a linguistically versatile polymath (he\nwas able to read scholarly work in English, French, Spanish, Italian,\nGerman, Dutch, Latin, and Greek) were in great demand from 1928\nonwards in his capacity as a Delegate to the Clarendon Press.\n\nPartly as a result of serious overwork coupled with insomnia,\nCollingwood\u2019s health went into decline from the early 1930s. In\nApril 1931 he suffered complications arising from chicken pox and\nbegan to suffer from high blood pressure. He was granted leave of\nabsence by the university; following his return, in the autumn of\n1932, he began writing an important new book, regarded by many as the\npinnacle of his philosophical achievement\u2014An Essay on\nPhilosophical Method (1933). This had its origins in the\nmethodological introduction to the lectures on moral philosophy he had\ndelivered annually throughout the preceding decade. The Essay\nwas a sustained investigation of the nature of philosophical reasoning\nthrough an examination of the distinctive character of philosophical\nconcepts. Following publication of the Essay, Collingwood\nfocused his philosophical energies on the philosophy of history and\nthe philosophy of nature. The lectures he delivered at this time later\nformed the basis of the posthumously published The Idea of\nHistory (1946) and The Idea of Nature (1945).\n\nIn 1935 Collingwood succeeded J.A. Smith as Waynflete Professor of\nMetaphysical Philosophy and moved from Pembroke to Magdalen College.\nHe delivered his inaugural lecture on The Historical\nImagination in October of that year. He had been elected as a\nFellow of the British Academy in 1934 and delivered a lecture on\nHuman Nature and Human History to the Academy in May 1936.\nThese two lectures were later incorporated into The Idea of\nHistory.\n\nIn 1937 Collingwood wrote The Principles of Art (1938);\nwhilst correcting the proofs he suffered a stroke, the first of many\nto come. From this time onwards he was conscious that he was writing\non borrowed time. His An Autobiography (1939) records his\ndetermination to put on record an account of the work he hoped to do\nbut might not live to complete. During a recuperative voyage to the\nDutch East Indies in 1938\u20139 he wrote An Essay on\nMetaphysics (1940) and began work on what he regarded as his\nmagnum opus, The Principles of History (not published until\n1995). In 1939 he sailed around the Greek islands with a group of\nRhodes scholars studying at Oxford\u2014a journey memorably\nrecollected and evoked in The First Mate\u2019s Log (1940).\nOn his return to Oxford Collingwood lectured on moral and political\nphilosophy and worked at The New Leviathan (1942) which he\nsaw as his contribution to the war effort. He wrote the book against a\nbackground of increasingly debilitating strokes.\n\nR.G. Collingwood died in Coniston on 9 January 1943; he was nearly 54.\nHe is buried in Coniston churchyard in an unassuming grave between his\nparents and John Ruskin. He was succeeded in the Waynflete Chair by\nGilbert Ryle.\n2. Metaphilosophy\n2.1 Philosophical distinctions and the overlap of classes\n\nCollingwood\u2019s first mature work, An Essay on Philosophical\nMethod (1933), is a substantial treatise in metaphilosophy which\nseeks to delineate the subject matter and method of philosophical\nanalysis. Here Collingwood says that the true work of philosophy is\n\u201cthe distinguishing of concepts \u2026coexisting in their\ninstances\u201d (EPM 2005: 51). The moral philosopher, for example,\ndistinguishes between different kinds of good: the pleasant, the\nexpedient, and the right (EPM 2005: 41). When philosophers distinguish\nbetween the pleasant, the expedient, and the right as species of the\ngood they are not sorting things into mutually exclusive classes. If\nthis were their goal then the philosophical distinction between the\npleasant, the expedient, and the right would imply that\n\n\nwhatever is pleasant must therefore be both inexpedient and wrong;\nthat whatever is expedient must be both wrong and unpleasant, and that\nwhatever is right must be both unpleasant and inexpedient. (EPM 2005:\n41)\n\n\nBut this is clearly not the case because philosophers allow that one\nand the same action may be brought under different descriptions\ndepending on whether it is motivated by desire (the pursuit of\npleasure), by self-interest (expediency) or by duty (the right).\nBecause philosophical distinctions bring objects under different\ndescriptions rather than sorting them into classes, they defy the\nrules which apply to the relation between genera and species in the\ntraditional theory of classification (EPM: 31). In the traditional\ntheory of classification, the adjacent species of a genus tend to be\nmutually exclusive. Natural history, for example, classifies organisms\ninto animals and vegetables, animals into vertebrates and\ninvertebrates, vertebrates into mammals, birds, reptiles, and so on.\nThese adjacent species tend to capture mutually exclusive classes (the\nclass of vertebrates is different from the class of invertebrates; the\nclass of animals is different from the class of vegetables). While\nthere may be some overlap between adjacent species in this type of\nclassification (the platypus is an animal that suckles its young like\na mammal and lies eggs like a bird) these cases are \u201cexceptional\nand limited\u201d (EPM: 30). Overlap of classes, on the other hand,\nis a \u201cregular\u201d feature of philosophical distinctions.\n(EPM: 36). Philosophical distinctions allow for complete not\nmerely partial overlap. It is not merely the case, for example, that\nsome actions may exemplify both the concept of expediency and that of\nthe right (in the way in which the platypus is both a mammal and a\nbird or amphibians are both aquatic and terrestrial animals), but that\nin principle any action which falls under one species of a\nphilosophical genus could also fall under its adjacent concept: the\nclass of actions which instantiate the principle of expediency could\ntherefore in principle be the very same as the class of actions which\ninstantiate the principle of duty. Collingwood\u2019s point when\nclaiming that the concepts of expediency and duty overlap goes beyond\nthe epistemic consideration that it is difficult to know a\nperson\u2019s motive in acting, whether they were motivated by duty\nor by expediency; his point is rather that a philosophical distinction\nis \u201ca distinction without a difference, that is, a distinction\nin the concepts without a difference in the instances\u201d (EPM:\n50). To say that philosophical distinctions are \u201cdistinctions\nwithout a difference\u201d is not derogatively to dismiss them as\ninsignificant pedantic distinctions, but to point out that\nphilosophically to disambiguate concepts is not the same activity as\nsorting things into classes. To disambiguate the concept of love from\nthat of jealousy, (not Collingwood\u2019s example) is not the same as\nsorting partners into the separate classes of loving and jealous ones.\nBy the same token to disambiguate the conception of the good into the\npleasant, the expedient, and the right is not the same as sorting\nactions into those performed in the pursuit of pleasure,\nself-interest, or duty. The distinction between the pleasant, the\nexpedient, and the right, (as with the distinction between love and\njealousy) is a distinction that philosophers would want to make even\nif the world were such that actions motivated by duty necessarily\nbenefitted the agent so that the class of actions motivated by\nself-interest or by duty would contain the very same members.\nPhilosophical distinctions are purely intensional distinctions to\nwhich there may correspond no difference in the class of objects\nfalling under the concepts that philosophical analysis\ndisambiguates.\n\nConcepts, Collingwood says, may be viewed from two perspectives, their\nextension and their intension. From the point of view of their\nextension a concept is \u201cgeneral\u201d in so far as it gathers\nunder itself \u201cthe plurality of its individual instances\u201d.\nFrom the point of view of their intension a concept is generic in so\nfar as it gathers \u201cthe plurality of its specific\ndifferentiations\u201d:\n\n\nThus the concept of colour unites all the individual colours of all\nindividual coloured things into a class of which they are members; but\nit also unites the specific colours red, orange, yellow, green, and so\nforth into a genus of which they are the species. It may be convenient\nto refer to the former unification by saying that the concept is\ngeneral, to the latter by saying that it is generic. (EPM 2005:\n28\u201329)\n\n\nIn the traditional doctrine of classification intensional distinctions\npiggyback on extensional ones:\n\n\nThe logical doctrine of classification, as it stands in the ordinary\ntext-books, implies a certain definite connexion between these two\ncharacteristics of the concept: namely that if a genus is\ndistinguished into a certain number of species, the class of its\ninstances can be correspondingly divided into an equal number of\nsub-classes. Each sub-class will comprise the instances of one\nspecific concept; the totality of the sub-classes will comprise that\nof the generic concept\u2026 (EPM 2005: 29)\n\n\nPhilosophical distinctions do not follow this logic because they do\nnot presuppose that the concepts the philosopher disambiguates capture\na specific set or class. The task of philosophical analysis precisely\nis to distinguish concepts which coincide in their instances. When two\nphilosophical concepts coincide in their instances the thing which\nexemplifies them is not a hybrid, as amphibians or the platypus are.\nIt is one thing seen from different perspective or brought under\ndifferent descriptions. So, for example, a song exemplifies the\nconcepts of music and poetry, but to say this is not the same as\nsaying that it is part music and part poetry in the way in which a\ncentaur is part man and part horse or the platypus is part mammal and\npart oviparous. Aesthetic distinctions between poetry and music, like\nmoral ones, are distinctions which bring the whole of the object, not\na part of it, under a different description. Philosophical\ndistinctions are purely intensional distinctions between distinct\nconcepts or genera. But they are not for this reason inconsequential.\nJust as those who fail to disambiguate the concept of love from that\nof jealousy will be not be able to comprehend how a loving partner\nneed not be jealous so those who fail to disambiguate the concept of\nthe good will not be able to comprehend how the pursuit of what is\nmorally right may not be in one\u2019s self-interest.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s account of the nature of overlap of classes in\nphilosophical distinctions informs his philosophy of mind and his\napproach to the question concerning the nature of the relation holding\nbetween the mind and the body. The distinction between the concept of\nmind and the concept of body (or matter) is a philosophical\ndistinction. The task of the philosopher of mind is to distinguish\nbetween concepts which coincide in their instances and to disambiguate\nwhat one means, for example, when speaking about the human being\nqua biological being and qua person. When\nphilosophers so distinguish between mind and body, they do not do this\nin the manner of natural scientists who sort animals into the classes\nof mammals and oviparous. Minded beings are not hybrids who are part\nmind and part body in the way in which the minotaur is part man and\npart horse:\n\n\nMan\u2019s body and man\u2019s mind are not two different things,\nbut the same thing\u2026 as known in two different ways. Not a part\nof man, but the whole of man is body in so far as he approaches the\nproblem of self-knowledge by the methods of natural science. Not a\npart of man, but the whole of man is mind, in so far as he approaches\nthe problem of self-knowledge by expanding and clarifying the data of\nreflection. (NL 1992: 11)\n\n\nThe philosophical distinction between the concepts of mind and body is\nnot to be confused with a real or metaphysical distinction as argued\nby Descartes. The claim that mind is a sui generis concept or category\nthat is distinct from that of the body does not entail that it could\nexist apart from the body. Philosophical distinctions are intensional\ndistinctions with no deep ontological implications. But the fact that\nthey are not meant to cut reality at the joints does not mean that\nthey do not carry any weight: those who fail to make the distinction\nbetween the concepts of mind and body are bound to fail to see a\ndistinction between the normative/rationalizing explanations of\nactions and the descriptive/nomological explanation of events and\nespouse the view that the mind can be studied and understood in the\nsame way as matter, by invoking causal laws. It is no surprise,\ntherefore, that much of Collingwood\u2019s later philosophy, his\nphilosophy of history in particular, is devoted to defending the\nautonomy of the explanatory practices of history (which he took to be\nthe science of mind) from those of natural science. Distinguishing the\nexplanandum of history, i.e., (mind), from that of science\n(matter/nature) is the true task of philosophy, a task that, for\nCollingwood, has to be distinguished from what he takes to be the\npseudo problem of an enquiry into the causal relation holding between\nthe mind and the body. The true question concerning the relation\nbetween the mind and the body\n\n\n\u2026 is the relation between the sciences of the body, or natural\nsciences, and the sciences of the mind; that is the relation enquiry\ninto which ought to be substituted for the make-believe inquiry into\nthe make-believe problem of \u201cthe relation between body and\nmind\u201d. (NL 1992: 2.49/11)\n\n\nAn implication of the ubiquitous nature of the overlap of classes is\nthat the justification for the employment of philosophical concepts\ncannot be based on empirical observation because philosophical\ndistinctions cannot be empirically verified. A geologist\u2019s\nclassification of rocks into sedimentary and crystalline, for example,\nis based on the observable features of the two types of rocks and is\nempirically verifiable; by contrast philosophical distinctions such as\nthose between the expedient and the right, mind and body, cannot be\nsimilarly justified precisely because they are distinctions in the\nconcepts without differentiation in the instances. The justification\nfor the deployment of philosophical concepts and distinctions lies in\nthe fact that they enable us to bring reality under different\ndescriptions and view it from different angles, that they enable one,\nfor example, to judge a work of art to be aesthetically beautiful and\nyet morally reprehensible.\n\nIn his later philosophy Collingwood will abandon the terminology of\nthe overlap of classes, but the commitment to the view that\nphilosophical distinctions are \u201cdistinctions without a\ndifference\u201d, and that the task of philosophical analysis is to\ndistinguish between concepts which coincide in their instances remains\neven after this terminology is left behind. In his second\nmetaphilosophical treatise An Essay on Metaphysics (1940) he\nsets out to disambiguate the different senses of the term\n\u201ccause\u201d. The term cause can be used, in what he refers to\nas sense I to mean \u201creason\u201d or \u201cmotive\u201d. In\nsense I\n\n\nthat which is caused is the free and deliberate act of a conscious and\nresponsible agent, and causing him to do it means affording him a\nmotive for so doing. (EM 1998: 285)\n\n\nThis is the way in which the term is used in the historical sciences\nor sciences of the mind. The term \u201ccause\u201d is also used in\nwhat he refers to as sense II to denote an antecedent condition that\nagents have the power to produce or prevent. In this sense a cause\nis\n\n\nan event or state of things by producing or preventing which we can\nproduce or prevent that whose cause it is said to be. (EM 1998:\n296\u20137)\n\n\nThe term cause is used in sense II in the practical sciences of\nnature, sciences such as medicine and engineering. Finally, the term\ncause is also employed in sense III in the theoretical sciences of\nnature where\n\n\nthat which is caused is an event or state of things and its cause is\nanother event or state of things such that (a) if the cause happens or\nexists, the effect must happen or exist even if no further conditions\nare fulfilled (b) the effect cannot happen or exist unless the cause\nhappens or exists. (EM 1998: 285\u201386)\n\n\nThe main difference between sense II and sense III of the term is that\nwhereas in the practical sciences of nature the cause of an event is\nan antecedent state of affairs considered from the point of view of an\ninterest in controlling and manipulating the natural environment, in\nthe theoretical sciences of nature the causes of natural events are\nviewed independently of any impact that agents can have on the natural\nenvironment: a cause in sense III is unconditional. The key difference\nbetween sense I, on the one hand, and sense II and III on the other,\nis that in sense II and III a cause is an antecedent condition,\nwhereas in sense I it is a logical ground. When one explains an\nagent\u2019s intention in acting by ascribing the agent a motive or\nreason, the action is explained not by invoking something that went on\nbefore (an antecedent condition in the form of an inner psychological\nprocess) but the motive which rationalises it. Conflating sense I with\neither sense II or III is to conflate normative/rationalizing with\ncausal explanations thereby also failing to grasp the distinction\nbetween their respective explananda: actions and events. The\ndistinction between the different senses of causation, like the\ndistinction between the expedient and the right, is not a distinction\nbetween separate classes of things; it is a distinction between\nconcepts that may coincide in their instances.\n2.2 Presuppositional analysis\n\nCollingwood returned to the question of the role of philosophical\nanalysis in his second metaphilosophical treatise, An Essay on\nMetaphysics (1940). While the commitment to the view that\nphilosophy disambiguates concepts that coincide in their instances\npersists, Collingwood presents the role of philosophical analysis in a\ndifferent way, by saying that philosophy\u2019s task is to uncover\nthe presuppositions of thought. This change of emphasis, as we shall\nsee, is at least in part motivated by an attempt to present his\nmetaphilosophical views in a language to which the emerging school of\nanalytic philosophy would have been more receptive and to engage in a\ndialogue with A.J. Ayer\u2019s logical positivist critique of\nmetaphysics.\n\nThe task of philosophy, Collingwood claims in An Essay on\nMetaphysics, is not to assert propositions in answers to\nquestions but to uncover presuppositions. Philosophy is\ntherefore concerned not with propositions but with presuppositions.\nPropositions are answers to questions. For example, the proposition\n\u201cThis is a clothes line\u201d answers the question \u201cWhat\nis that thing for?\u201d (EM 1998: 24). Presuppositions, on the other\nhand give rise to questions. When one asks, \u201cWhat is that thing\nfor?\u201d one must presuppose \u201cthat it is \u2018for\u2019\nsomething\u201d (EM 1998: 26). Without any presuppositions the\nquestion would not arise.\n\nPresuppositions differ from propositions in one fundamental respect:\npropositions have truth-values. They are asserted as either true or\nfalse. Presuppositions, on the other hand lack truth values; they are\nneither true nor false. This is because they do not fulfil their role\n(that of giving rise to questions) in virtue of being true or false.\nJust as the validity of an inference does not depend on whether the\npremises from which the inference is drawn are true or false, so the\n\u201clogical efficacy\u201d (EM 1998: 27) of a presupposition,\ni.e., its power to give rise to a question, does not depend on the\npresupposition being either true or false, or even on being believed\nto be true or false. This consideration, Collingwood says,\n\n\nis a matter of common knowledge in scientific thinking; where it is\ncommon and even profitable to argue from suppositions we know to be\nfalse, or which we believe to be false, or concerning which we have\nneither knowledge nor belief as to whether we are false or true. These\ndoubts or negations in no way affect the validity of the argument. (EM\n1998: 28)\n\n\nWhether a statement is a \u201cproposition\u201d or a\n\u201cpresupposition\u201d is determined not by its content but by\nthe role that the statement plays in the logic of question and answer.\nIf its role is to answer a question, then it is a proposition and it\nhas a truth-value. If its role is to give rise to a question, then it\nis a presupposition and it does not have a truth-value. Some\nstatements can play different roles. They may be both\npropositional answers to questions and presuppositions which\ngive rise to questions. For example, that an object is for something,\nthat it has a function may be a presupposition which gives rise to the\nquestion \u201cwhat is that thing for?\u201d, but it may also be an\nanswer to a question if the statement has the role of an assertion.\nPhilosophical analysis is concerned with a special kind of\npresupposition, one which has only one role in the logic of question\nand answer, namely that of giving rise to questions. Collingwood calls\nthese presuppositions \u201cabsolute\u201d. Absolute presuppositions\nare foundational assumptions that enable certain lines of questioning\nbut are not themselves open to scrutiny. The three senses of causation\ndiscussed above are examples of absolute presuppositions which\nstructure different forms of inquiry. A physician, for example,\nabsolutely presupposes sense II of causation, according which a cause\nis\n\n\nan event or state of things by producing or preventing which we can\nproduce or prevent that whose cause it is said to be. (EM 1998:\n296\u20137)\n\n\nQua practical scientist of nature, the physician absolutely\npresupposes a handle or manipulability conception of causation which\nmakes it possible to intervene in nature to achieve certain intended\nresults, i.e., to restore health. This sense of causation is at work\nin statement such as \u201cThe cause of malaria is the bite of a\nmosquito\u201d (EM 1998: 299) or \u201cthe cause of a man\u2019s\nsweating is a dose of aspirin\u201d (EM 1998: 299). The\npresupposition is absolute because it could not be questioned without\nat the same time undermining the kind of inquiry it makes possible.\nAbsolute presuppositions in this respect differ from relative\npresuppositions. A physician prescribes a dose of aspirin on the\nassumption it will cause a patient to break into a sweat. This\npresupposition is relative because it could potentially be overthrown\nby future research. But the underlying conception of causation is a\ncondition sine qua non for practising medicine. It is these\nabsolute presuppositions that philosophy seeks to uncover by\nregressing from propositional answers to the questions they are\nanswers to, and from the questions to the presuppositions which must\nbe made for the questions to arise.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s denial that absolute presuppositions have truth\nvalues informs a commitment to a kind of explanatory pluralism\naccording to which the choice between different kinds of explanation\ndoes not depend on whether they capture pure being but on whether they\nare fit for purpose. He illustrates this explanatory pluralism by\nimagining a scenario in which a car stops while driving up a steep\nhill. As the driver stands by the side of the road a passerby, who\nhappens to be a theoretical physicist offers his help. The car, he\nexplains, has stopped because\n\n\nthe top of a hill is farther removed from the earth\u2019s centre\nthan its bottom and \u2026 consequently more power is needed to take\nthe car uphill than to take her along the level. (EM 1998: 302)\n\n\nA second passerby (who happens to be an Automobile\nAssociation\u00a0man)\u00a0proffers a different explanation: he holds\nup a loose cable and says \u201cLook here, Sir, you are running on\nthree cylinders\u201d (EM 1998: 303). The first explanation invokes\nthe sense of causation that belongs to the theoretical sciences of\nnature, sense III. The second explanation invokes the sense of\ncausation that belongs to the practical sciences of nature, sense II.\nThe choice between these explanations, for Collingwood is determined\nby the nature of the question asked. As he puts it:\n\n\nIf I had been a person who could flatten out hills by stamping on them\nthe passerby would have been right to call my attention to the hill as\nthe cause of the stoppage; not because the hill was a hill but because\nI was able to flatten it out. (EM 1998: 303)\n\n\nThis scenario illustrates that there are different explanations,\ncorresponding to different senses of causation, each answering a\ndifferent kind of question. When the different senses of causation are\ndisambiguated, then it becomes clear that there is no conflict between\nthe explanation of the theoretical physicist and that of the car\nmechanic, because they answer different kinds of questions, questions\nwhich differ because they are entailed by different absolute\npresuppositions. Explanations genuinely conflict with one another only\nif they provide answers to the same question, but they do not if they\nare answering different questions. The task of presuppositional\nanalysis is to undo the conceptual knots in which our thoughts get\ntangled when we mix and match answers of one kind with questions of\nanother by failing to see the entailment relations which hold between\npresuppositions, the question to which they give rise, and the sort of\npropositional answers which address those questions:\n\n\nIn unscientific thinking our thoughts are coagulated into knots and\ntangles; we fish up a thought out of our minds like an anchor foul of\nits own cable, hanging upside-down and draped in seaweed with\nshellfish sticking to it and dump the whole thing on deck quite\npleased with ourselves for having got it up at all. Thinking\nscientifically means disentangling all this mess, and reducing a knot\nof thoughts in which everything sticks together anyhow to a system or\nseries of thoughts in which thinking the thoughts is at the same time\nthinking the connexions between them. (EM 1998: 22\u201323)\n\n\nThe logical inquiry into the connections holding between\npresuppositions, questions and answers is the true task of conceptual\nanalysis in metaphysics, a task that must replace metaphysics\ntraditionally understood as the study of pure being. There is no such\nthing as knowledge of pure being because there can be no\npresuppositionless knowledge and there can be no presuppositionless\nknowledge because all knowledge is pursued in answer to questions and\nno question could arise if no presuppositions were made. The study of\nreality under the different aspects enabled by the adoption of\ndifferent presuppositions is not an ontological but a logical enquiry\nand metaphysics, so understood is, a \u201cmetaphysics without\nontology\u201d (EM 1998: 18).\n\nFailure to recognise that knowledge rests on presuppositions\nencourages the belief that pure being is a possible object of\nknowledge. Traditionally it was metaphysics that was deemed to be the\nscience of pure being. In the aftermath of the scientific revolution\nthis role was increasingly claimed by the most fundamental of the\nsciences: physics. If Collingwood\u2019s claim that metaphysics\nshould take the form of a logical enquiry into presuppositions is\nright, then there is no contest between metaphysics and physics or\nmore generally between philosophy and (natural) science because no\nform of knowledge can claim the title of science of pure being.\nPhilosophy does not conflict with natural science because it does not\nadvance claims about the nature of reality but about the\npresuppositions under which all sciences, including natural science,\noperate. Nor is there conflict between (natural) science and other\nforms of knowledge because different forms of knowledge answer\ndifferent kinds of questions, questions which arise from different\npresuppositions. In reminding philosophers that all knowledge,\nincluding scientific knowledge, rests on presuppositions, Collingwood\nrehabilitates the older, Latin sense of the term scientia\nwhich is not synonymous with natural science but with \u201ca body of\nsystematic or orderly thinking about a determinate\nsubject-matter\u201d (EM 1998: 4). The use of \u201cscience\u201d\nto mean \u201cnatural science\u201d is a slang use of the\nterm (EM 1998: 4) that has that is symptomatic of the prevalence of\nscientism, the belief that only scientific knowledge is a form of\nknowledge and that science can answer all questions.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s account of absolute presuppositions generates an\ninteresting angle on the question of scepticism concerning induction.\nHume had argued that inductive inferences rely on the principle of the\nuniformity of nature. If it is true that the future resembles the\npast, then inferences such as \u201cthe sun will rise tomorrow\u201d\nare inductively justified. However, since the principle is neither a\nproposition about matters of fact nor one about relations of ideas the\nproposition \u201cnature is uniform\u201d is an illegitimate\nmetaphysical proposition and inductive inferences lack justification.\nThe principle of the uniformity of nature, Collingwood argues, is not\na proposition, but an absolute presupposition, one which cannot be\ndenied without undermining empirical science. As it is an absolute\npresupposition the notion of verifiability does not apply to it\nbecause it does its job not in so far as it is true, or even believed\nto be true, but in so far as it is presupposed. The demand that it\nshould be verified is nonsensical and the question that Hume ask does\nnot therefore arise:\n\n\n\u2026any question involving the presupposition that an absolute\npresupposition is a proposition, such as the question \u201cIs it\ntrue?\u201d \u201cWhat evidence is there for it?\u201d \u201cHow\ncan it be demonstrated?\u201d \u201cWhat right have we to presuppose\nit if it can\u2019t?\u201d, is a nonsense question. (EM 1998:\n33)\n\n\nSimilar considerations, as we shall see later, are invoked by\nCollingwood against Ayer\u2019s principle of verifiability.\n2.3 The \u201cradical conversion\u201d hypothesis\n\nThere is clearly continuity between Collingwood\u2019s account of the\nnature of philosophical distinctions, as developed in An Essay on\nPhilosophical Method and his later claim in An Essay on\nMetaphysics that the role of presuppositional analysis is to undo\nthe conceptual knots in which unsystematic thinking gets tangled. His\nattempt to disambiguate the different senses of causation in An\nEssay on Metaphysics seems to be engaging in a task akin to what\nin An Essay on Philosophical Method he described as the\ndistinguishing of concepts that coincide in their instances. Yet a\nmajor issue of contention in Collingwood scholarship concerns whether\nCollingwood\u2019s later work, beginning with An Essay on\nMetaphysics, historicized his earlier conception of the role of\nphilosophical analysis. This is because An Essay on\nMetaphysics contains a fundamental ambiguity. On the one hand it\npresents presuppositional analysis as the task of regressing from\npropositional answers to questions and from questions to\npresuppositions. This is a logical task aimed at putting order in our\nthoughts and getting rid of conceptual confusions. On the other hand,\nit presents presuppositions as historical beliefs thereby suggesting\nthat the goal of presuppositional analysis is not so much to get rid\nof conceptual confusion as to describe what certain people believed in\ndifferent periods of time. Metaphysics, Collingwood says\n\n\nis the attempt to find out what absolute presuppositions have been\nmade by this or that person or group of persons, on this or that\noccasion or group of occasions, in the course of this or that occasion\nor group of occasions, in the course of this or that piece of\nthinking. (EM 1998: 47)\n\n\nStatements such as these have a strong historicist flavour. This\nambiguity exposes a tension between two different conceptions of the\nrole of philosophical analysis. On the first conception the task of\nphilosophy is to delineate the subject matters of different forms of\nknowledge and denounce the encroachment of one form of knowledge on\nthe subject matter of another. The emphasis is on explanatory\npluralism, not historical relativism. The defence of the\nautonomy of historical explanation in The Idea of History,\nfor example, implies that the role of philosophical analysis is to\nidentify the distinctive presuppositions of history and to distinguish\nthem from those of natural science with a view to combating scientism.\nThe second conception, by contrast, places the emphasis on historical\nrelativism rather than explanatory pluralism. It is this second\nconception of the role of philosophical analysis in An Essay on\nMetaphysics that has led to the view that Collingwood\u2019s\nlater metaphilosophy differs substantially from his earlier view of\nthe role of philosophical analysis, a view sometimes referred to as\n\u201cthe radical conversion hypothesis\u201d. The hypothesis of a\nhistoricist turn was first advanced by Malcolm Knox in the editorial\nintroduction to the posthumously published The Idea of\nHistory. It was also endorsed by early commentators such as A.\nDonagan (1962 and 1972), Toulmin (1972) and N. Rotenstreich (1972).\nThe expression \u201cradical conversion hypothesis\u201d, however,\nwas actually coined by Rubinoff (1966) who alongside Mink (1969)\nrejected it as an inadequate description of Collingwood\u2019s\nposition. This is still a live debate in Collingwood scholarship,\nalthough more recent studies (Martin 1989; Modood 1989; Connelly 1990;\nOldfield 1995; Beaney 2005; D\u2019Oro 2002, 2010) tend to emphasise\nthe unity rather than discontinuity in Collingwood\u2019s\nmetaphilosophical approach.\n2.4 The ontological argument and the correspondence with Ryle\n\nThe question concerning the relation between Collingwood\u2019s two\nmetaphilosophical treatises and whether the conception of the role of\nphilosophical analysis articulated in An Essay on Metaphysics\nis continuous with that described in An Essay on Philosophical\nMethod is further complicated by the fact that An Essay on\nPhilosophical Method contains a defence of the ontological\nargument that appears to be at odds with Collingwood\u2019s later\nclaim that metaphysics is a logical, not an ontological inquiry and\nwith the assertion that presuppositional analysis is a form of\n\u201cmetaphysics without ontology\u201d. The ontological proof is\nnormally regarded as the pinnacle of metaphysical knowledge, knowledge\nthat is both necessary (as a priori knowledge) and has existential\nimport (as empirical knowledge). Collingwood\u2019s allegiance to the\nontological proof in An Essay on Philosophical Method would\ntherefore seem to provide further evidence for the hypothesis of a\nrift between Collingwood\u2019s earlier and later conception of\nphilosophical analysis because it seems to be advancing the sort of\nrobust metaphysical claims which Collingwood\u2019s later conception\nof metaphysics is keen to leave behind. However, the detail of\nCollingwood\u2019s discussion of the ontological proof suggests that\nhe had a rather unorthodox understanding of what the ontological proof\nestablishes (D\u2019Oro 2002). Paradoxical as this might sound, he\ndid not seem to think that the ontological proof establishes any\nsubstantive ontological conclusions and that it yields the sort of\nmetaphysical knowledge he later explicitly claimed to be impossible.\nHis concern with the ontological proof was intricately connected with\nan attempt to delineate the subject matter of philosophical analysis,\nnot the existence of metaphysical entities. God, for Collingwood, is\n\u201cthat which we are thinking about when we are thinking\nphilosophically\u201d (Collingwood\u2019s 1935 private letter to\nRyle, published in the 2005 edition of An Essay on Philosophical\nMethod, EPM 2005: 257). This claim may be clarified by saying\nthat philosophical concepts are not contingently instantiated in an\nempirical class of objects (as we have seen, they do not sort things\ninto classes); they are necessarily instantiated in the forms of\njudgement or inference which they make possible. For example, the\nconcept of the good, qua expediency, is necessarily\ninstantiated in hypothetical or instrumental imperatives and the\nconcept of mind is necessarily instantiated in judgements which\nexplain actions qua expression of thought. This is the kernel\nof truth that, according to Collingwood, is worth restating in the\nontological argument.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s discussion of the ontological argument in An\nEssay on Philosophical Method gave rise to a lively epistolary\nexchange with Ryle (the exchange is published in the 2005 edition of\nAn Essay on Philosophical Method). The correspondence was\ntriggered by the publication of an article in Mind by Ryle\n(1935) which attacked Collingwood\u2019s sympathetic appraisal of the\nontological proof on the grounds that there are no such things as\npropositions which are both necessary and existential, i.e., no such\nthings as metaphysical propositions, like the one asserting the\nnecessary existence of God. Collingwood replied to Ryle in a private\nletter by claiming that that there is a third kind of proposition,\nphilosophical propositions, which feature philosophical concepts,\npropositions such as \u201cMind exists\u201d or \u201cMatter\nexists\u201d. Such propositions are necessary but not merely\nhypothetical because the philosophical concepts whose existence they\nassert are necessarily instantiated in the judgements employed by the\npractitioners of a given science. \u201cMind exists\u201d in so far\nas one explains actions by means of rationalisations, rather than\nnomological explanations; the concept of mind is embedded in the kind\nof judgement or inference that it makes possible. The main bone of\ncontention in the correspondence between Ryle and Collingwood was\ntherefore not the ontological argument in its traditional form, but\nwhether or not philosophy has an autonomous domain of inquiry, i.e.,\nwhether there are distinctive philosophical concepts, (concepts which\nallow for complete extensional overlap). As we have seen Collingwood\nlater revisited the claim that philosophy has an autonomous domain of\ninquiry in An Essay on Metaphysics, where he reformulated it\nby saying that philosophy is not an ontological but a logical enquiry\ninto the presuppositions which govern thought.\n\nIn spite of Collingwood\u2019s attempts to qualify his commitment to\nthe ontological argument Ryle continued to read Collingwood\u2019s\ndefence of the ontological proof at face value refusing to accept that\nthe ontological proof could properly be interpreted as anything other\nthan what it states on the label, i.e., an argument for the existence\nof God. Collingwood, for his part, insisted on illustrating what the\nsubject matter of philosophy is, by defending a highly controversial\ninterpretation of what the ontological proof establishes. Be this as\nit may, the misunderstandings between Collingwood and Ryle show how\nvery difficult it must have been for Collingwood to translate his\ninsights in the language of the burgeoning school of analytic\nphilosophy. In spite of the misunderstandings it involves, the\nCollingwood-Ryle correspondence reveals some of the issues which truly\ntroubled philosophers in the first half of the twentieth century and\noffers a fascinating window onto the origins of analytic philosophy\n(D\u2019Oro 2000; Vrijen 2006).\n2.5 The metaphilosophical battle with Ayer\n\nIn the debate with Ryle which unfolded on the pages of Mind\nand in the private correspondence Collingwood had tried to defend the\nclaim that there is a distinctive kind of proposition which captures\nthe subject matter of philosophy, but his attempt to capture the\ndistinctive subject matter of philosophical analysis was dismissed by\nRyle as being of a piece with a dusty old metaphysics. The drastic\nchange of terminology in An Essay on Metaphysics is at least\nin part an attempt to defend the claim that philosophy has a\ndistinctive subject matter different from both that of the exact and\nthe natural sciences, but to do so in a way that would not lend itself\nto the kind of misunderstanding that led Ryle to dismiss\nCollingwood\u2019s metaphilosophical vision as belonging to an\nidealist metaphysics of the sort that analytic philosophy wanted to\nleave behind. This terminological change put Collingwood in a better\nposition to engage with the revival of empiricism at the hands of A.J.\nAyer. In Language Truth and Logic (1936) Ayer revitalised\nHume\u2019s critique of metaphysics by invoking the principle of\nverifiability, according to which propositions are meaningful insofar\nas they are empirically verifiable. Propositions which are not\nempirically verifiable are nonsense unless they are tautologies. As\nfar as Collingwood was concerned Ayer\u2019s revival of the Humean\nfork had unpalatable metaphilosophical implications because it\nentailed that to be meaningful the claims of philosophy must be either\nempirically verifiable, as the propositions of natural science, or\nanalytic truths, as the propositions of exact science. An Essay on\nMetaphysics is a pointed attack on the metaphilosophical\nimplications of this claim. Ayer\u2019s commitment to the view that\nthere are only two types of legitimate propositions, empirical and\nanalytic, was, for Collingwood, based on a failure to acknowledge that\nstatements can play different roles in the logic of question and\nanswer. Some statements are answers to questions and, in so far as\ntheir role is to answer questions, they are truth evaluable. But some\nstatements have a different role, namely, to give rise to questions\nand they perform this role not in so far as they are true or false,\nbut in so far as they are presupposed. As such they are not truth\nevaluable, because they are not asserted as propositional answers to\nquestions. Statements such as \u201ca cause is an event by producing\nor preventing which one can produce or prevent that whose cause it is\nsaid to be\u201d (sense II of causation) is not asserted by the\nphilosopher as a proposition. What the philosopher asserts is not\n\u201ccauses in sense II exist or are true of an inquiry independent\nreality\u201d (which would be an illegitimate metaphysical\nproposition) but rather \u201ccauses in sense II are absolutely\npresupposed in the practical sciences of nature\u201d. Philosophy\nyields not first order knowledge but second order knowledge or\nunderstanding of the presuppositions on which knowledge rests.\nAyer\u2019s classification of propositions along the lines of the\nHuman fork conflates presuppositions with propositions and, as a\nresult, fails to acknowledge that philosophy has a distinctive subject\nmatter, namely absolute presuppositions, and a distinctive role, to\ndetect presuppositions. Absolute presuppositions are not reducible\neither to the propositions of the exact or those of the natural\nsciences. Nor are they ruled out as meaningless propositions by the\nprinciple of verifiability because, since they are not propositions,\nthe notion of verifiability does not apply to them.\n2.6 Realism and idealism\n\nCollingwood is often referred to as a British idealist, but his\nallegiance to idealism was in large measure a response to the Oxford\nrealism he had imbibed as a student and continued to profess until\naround 1916. Hence he tended to be rather wary of the label\n\u201cidealist\u201d, and in his correspondence with Gilbert Ryle he\nexplicitly rejected it (EPM\u00a02005: 256). However, in his lectures\non Central Problems of Metaphysics (1935) he tentatively propounded a\nform of what he termed \u201cobjective idealism.\u201d But,\nnonetheless, as in his response to Ryle, he continued to rail against\nthose who sought to pin his position down to an \u201cism\u201d,\nonce remarking that \"I am not going to be pigeon-holed into one of\nyour neat categories. Philosophy is a process of inquiry, not dogmatic\npositions\" (Hector 2000).\n\nThis reluctance is probably due to the fact that idealism is most\noften identified with immaterialism and he would not have wished his\ncriticism of realism to be interpreted as resting on a commitment to\nthe claim that the real is ideal or that mind is causally responsible\nfor the existence of reality. If the contrast between idealism and\nrealism is understood as one between two metaphysical views concerning\nthe ontological constitution of reality (is it mental? Is it\nmaterial?) Collingwood had nothing to contribute to the debate between\nrealists and idealists; he would have regarded it as belonging to\nmetaphysics as the study of pure being, not as metaphysics understood\nas a form of presuppositional analysis. In An Autobiography\n(1939) he contrasted realism not with immaterialism but with the\ncommitment to presuppositionless knowledge or the realist view\npropounded by Cook Wilson and Prichard that \u201cknowing makes no\ndifference to what is known\u201d (AA 2013: 44). Denying realism, so\nunderstood, is to deny that there can be any such thing as knowledge\nof pure being. Since all knowledge takes the form of answers to\nquestions, and all questions rest on presuppositions, knowledge\nnecessarily has presuppositions. Collingwood\u2019s critique of\nrealism therefore takes Kant\u2019s criticism of the possibility of\nknowing things as they are in themselves a step further. Kant did not\ndeny that talk about knowledge of things as they are in themselves is\ncoherent; he simply claimed that this sort of knowledge is unavailable\nto us. Collingwood\u2019s critique of realism, by contrast, denies\nthat there is any such thing as presuppositionless knowledge.\nPresuppositionless knowledge is not a kind of knowledge that it is not\npossible for us to acquire but may be available to another being, such\nas God: the idea of presuppositionless knowledge involves an oxymoron\nbecause all knowing involves presuppositions.\n3. History and Science\n3.1 The historical past and the presuppositions of historical inquiry\n\nAn Essay on Metaphysics contains a general statement of\nCollingwood\u2019s metaphilosophy and his view that metaphysics is\nnot an ontological inquiry into pure being but a logical inquiry that\ntakes the form of presuppositional analysis. While An Essay on\nMetaphysics explained, in the most general terms, what\npresuppositional analysis is, The Idea of History (1946) and\nThe Principles of History (1999) seek to uncover the\npresuppositions governing historical inquiry into the past.\nCollingwood\u2019s philosophy of history asks the question:\n\u201cwhat are the presuppositions that govern the historical\nunderstanding of the past?\u201d and \u201cwhat does it mean to\nunderstand the past historically?\u201d The nature of\nCollingwood\u2019s concern with the past is not metaphysical. He is\nnot advancing a theory concerning the nature of time, whether, for\nexample, it is ever-present or a growing block. Nor is it primarily an\nepistemological concern with the question of how one acquires\nknowledge of the past, given that it is not available for observation,\nalthough he does address some epistemological questions. The nature of\nhis concern with the nature of the past is first and foremost a\nconceptual concern with the question \u201cWhat is the historical\npast? What does it mean to understand the past\nhistorically?\u201d\n\nThe historical past is the past understood\nhistorically, i.e., from the perspective of certain\npresuppositions, presuppositions that give rise to certain kinds of\nquestions, questions that are distinctive of historical inquiry and\ndiffer from those of natural science. The past in so far as it is\nunderstood historically (the historical past) is therefore\nnot the same thing as the past as it is studied by a natural\nscientist. Just as the term \u201ccause\u201d needs to be\ndisambiguated to avoid conceptual confusion, so does the term\n\u201cpast\u201d because it means different things to the\nhumanistically oriented historiographer as it does, for example, to a\ngeologist:\n\n\nThere is a certain analogy between the archaeologist\u2019s\ninterpretation of a stratified site and a geologist\u2019s\ninterpretation of rock-horizons with their associated fossils; but the\ndifference is no less clear than the similarity. The\narchaeologist\u2019s use of his stratified relics depends on his\nconceiving them as artifacts serving human purposes and thus\nexpressing a particular way in which men have thought of their own\nlife; and from his point of view the palaeontologist, arranging his\nfossils in a time-series, is not working as an historian, but only as\na scientist thinking in a way which can at most be described as\nquasi-historical. (IH 1993: 212)\n\n\nWhile both the geologist and the historian are concerned with the\npast, the questions that they ask and the presuppositions which give\nrise to those questions are different. Scientific inquiry rests on the\npresupposition of the uniformity of nature. This principle is required\nto formulate the inductive hypotheses which enable empirical\nscientists to predict what will happen in the future and retrodict\nwhat happened in the past. Empirically minded scientists presuppose\nthat everything that happens is subject to natural laws which are\ninvariant over time, for example, that water freezes at 0\u00b0 Celsius\nunder the reign of Queen Victoria as well as the time of Henry VIII.\nBut while this presupposition is well suited to serve the explanatory\ngoals of natural science, it is of limited use to historians who are\nconcerned not with what is invariant throughout history, but with what\nis distinctive about different periods of time. It would not help an\nEgyptologist to understand the rituals of the ancient Egyptian to\nascribe them the mindset of a medieval feudal baron. As Collingwood\nputs it:\n\n\nTypes of behaviour do, no doubt, recur, so long as minds of the same\nkind are placed in the same kind of situations. The behaviour-patterns\ncharacteristic of a feudal baron were no doubt fairly constant so long\nas there were feudal barons living in a feudal society. But they will\nbe sought in vain (except by an inquirer content with the loosest and\nmost fanciful analogies) in a world whose social structure is of\nanother kind. In order that behaviour-patterns may be constant, there\nmust be in existence a social order which recurrently produces\nsituations of a certain kind. But social orders are historical facts,\nand subject to inevitable change, fast or slow. A positive science of\nmind will, no doubt, be able to establish uniformities and\nrecurrences, but it can have no guarantee that the laws it establishes\nwill hold good beyond the historical period from which its facts are\ndrawn. (IH 1993: 223\u2013224)\n\n\nCollingwood is critical of those philosophers who, like Bradley\n(1874), bring the presuppositions of natural science to bear upon the\nstudy of the historical past. It is not the role of\nhistorians to dismiss as false the testimony of historical agents who\nattest to the occurrence of miracles on the grounds that since nature\nis uniform and its laws do not change, the miracles past agents\nattested to could not have happened because their occurrence\ncontravenes the laws of nature. This \u201cpositivistic spirit\u201d\n(IH 1993: 135\u201336) encourages a judgmental attitude towards the\nhistorical sources rather than an attempt to understand their meaning.\nThis is not to say that historians need to believe that miracles\nhappened in order to understand the sources, but rather that\nunderstanding the role that belief in the supernatural had for the\nagents who witnessed to them is more important for the historian than\nassessing whether belief in the supernatural is true or false:\n\n\nIf the reasons why it is hard for a man to cross the mountains is\nbecause he is frightened of the devils in them, it is folly for the\nhistorian, preaching at him across a gulf of centuries, to say\n\u201cThis is sheer superstition, there are no devils at all. Face\nfacts, and realize there are no dangers in the mountains except rocks\nand water and snow, wolves perhaps, and bad men perhaps, but no\ndevils.\u201d The historian says that these are the facts because\nthat is the way in which he has been taught to think. But the\ndevil-fearer says that the presence of devils is a fact, because that\nis the way in which he has been taught to think. The historian thinks\nit a wrong way; but wrong ways of thinking are just as much historical\nfacts as right ones, and, no less than they, determine the situation\n(always a thought-situation) in which the man who shares them is\nplaced. (IH 1993: 317)\n\n\nThe important question concerning any statement contained in an\nhistorical source \u201cis not whether it is true or false, but what\nit means\u201d (IH 1993: 260). Ignoring this advice leads to writing\n\u201cscissors-and-paste\u201d histories where the sources are\ntreated as worthwhile historical material and admitted into the\nhistorian\u2019s narrative only if they are deemed to be believable\nby the historian\u2019s own standards of evidence. To understand the\npast historically is to understand the \u201ccontext of\nthought\u201d (IH 1993: 299) of past agents, their frame of\nmind. What makes an investigation historical, therefore, is\nnot simply the fact that it is focused on the past, but the kind of\nconcerns by which it is guided when investigating the past. To\nunderstand past agents is to understand the way in which they\nreasoned, the inferences that they drew, the conceptual connections\nwhich they made, the symbolic significance they attached to certain\nevents. Understanding a past occurrence, such as Caesar\u2019s\ncrossing of the Rubicon historically, for example, is to understand\nthe significance that it had for a contemporary Roman who knew what\nRoman law permitted and proscribed. This is what differentiates a\nconcern with the historical past from a concern with the natural\npast:\n\n\nThe historian, investigating an event in the past, makes a distinction\nbetween what may be called the outside and the inside of an event. By\nthe outside of the event I mean everything belonging to it which can\nbe described in terms of bodies and their movements: the passage of\nCaesar, accompanied by certain men, across a river called the Rubicon\nat one date, or the spilling of his blood across the floor of the\nsenate-house at another. By the inside of the event I mean that in it\nwhich can only be described in terms of thought: Caesar\u2019s\ndefiance of Republican law, or the clash of constitutional policy\nbetween himself and his assassins. The historian is never concerned\nwith either of these to the exclusion of the other. He is\ninvestigating not mere events (where by a mere event I mean one which\nhas only an outside and no inside) but actions, and an action is the\nunity of the outside and the inside of an event. He is interested in\nthe crossing of the Rubicon only in its relation to Republican law,\nand in the spilling of Caesar\u2019s blood only in relation to a\nconstitutional conflict. (IH 1993: 213)\n\n\nTo understand Caesar\u2019s crossing of the Rubicon against the\nbackground of Republican law is to understand the crossing as\ntransgressing not a law of nature (natural laws apply uniformly to the\npresent, past, and future), but a military norm which banned armed\ngenerals from crossing a border (norms, unlike natural laws, change\nfrom time to time). Understanding actions historically requires\nunderstanding them more like responses to commands that may be\nfollowed or disregarded, than as instances (or counter instances) of\nempirical laws. When understood historically, therefore, the actions\nof past agents are explained more in the manner in which one\nunderstands the action of a motorist who stops at a traffic light\n(i.e., as abiding by a traffic regulation) than they are in the way in\nwhich an astronomer retrodicts the death of a star. The mindset of\npast agents cannot be investigated under the presupposition which\ngoverns empirical science, i.e., the uniformity of nature, because the\nstudy of mind, is a \u201cnormative or criteriological enquiry\u201d\n(PA: 171, footnote).\n\nThe distinction between the historical past and the natural past\ncorresponds to the distinction between the subject matters of the\nsciences of mind and nature: the former study actions, in so far as\nthey explain what happens as an expression of thought, the latter\nstudy events insofar as they approach their subject matter as\ninstantiating certain observable patterns. As such\n\u201cactions\u201d and \u201cevents\u201d are the correlatives of\ndifferent kinds inferences. Collingwood captured the distinction\nbetween actions and events by claiming that the former have an inside\nwhich the latter lack (IH 1993: 118). The point of this claim was to\ndraw attention to the fact that the meaning or significance of an\naction eludes nomological explanations which account for what happens\nby subsuming their explanandum under general laws. A historian might,\nfor example, observe certain empirical regularities (in the past every\ntime that white smoke emanated from the Sistine chapel in Rome, large\ncrowds of people cheered), without understanding \u201cwhy\u201d in\na particular sense of \u201cwhy\u201d the crowds cheered. If a\nsocial scientist suggested that the crowds cheered because\nwhite smoke emanated from the Sistine Chapel, this kind of\n\u201cbecause\u201d would singularly fail to address the question\nthat the historian wants answered. The kind of explanation that would\nsatisfy the curiosity of the historian is one which states something\nalong the lines of \u201cthe crowds cheered because a new pope was\nelected\u201d but such an explanation would not be possible without\ninvoking the \u201ccontext of thought\u201d within which alone one\ncan understand the symbolic significance of the white smoke. Words\nlike \u201ccause\u201d or \u201cbecause\u201d, Collingwood claims,\nare not necessarily\n\n\nout of place in reference to history; it only means that they are used\nthere in a special sense. When a scientist asks: \u201cWhy did that\npiece of litmus paper turn pink?\u201d he means \u201cOn what kinds\nof occasions do pieces of litmus paper turn pink?\u201d When an\nhistorian asks \u201cWhy did Brutus stab Caesar?\u201d he means\n\u201cWhat did Brutus think, which made him decide to stab\nCaesar?\u201d The cause of the event, for him, means the thought in\nthe mind of the person by whose agency the event came about: and this\nis not something other than the event, it is the inside of the event\nitself. (IH 1993: 214\u2013215)\n\n\nThe inside/outside distinction that Collingwood often invokes to\nexplicate the differences between the subject matters of history and\nscience is a highly metaphorical way of defending a commitment to\nexplanatory pluralism and the irreducibility of historical to\nscientific explanations. This metaphor has unfortunately sometimes\nbeen read literally, leading to Collingwood being unfairly attacked\nfor defending the view that the subject matter of history is an\ninternal, unobservable psychological process and for putting forward\nan equally implausible method for accessing it: re-enactment.\n3.2 Re-enactment\n\nOne of the most discussed aspects of Collingwood\u2019s philosophy of\nhistory is his claim that the historical past is not retrodicted but\nre-enacted. The task of historians is not to establish that a past\nevent had to happen in the past, in a way analogous to that in which a\nscientist predicts that a solar eclipse will happen in the future, but\nto re-enact the thoughts of historical agents. Collingwood claims that\nwhen historians re-enact the thought of an historical agent, they do\nnot re-enact a thought of a similar kind but the very same thought as\nthe agent. This claim has often been regarded as counterintuitive\nbecause to say that the thought of the agent and that of the historian\nare one and the same appears to presuppose that there is only one\nrather than two numerically distinct acts of thought: that of the\nhistorian and that of the agent. Collingwood\u2019s point, however,\nis that, since what the historian re-enacts, i.e., the propositional\ncontent of thought (he refers to this simply as thought) is\ndistinct from the acts of thinking (he refers to these as\nsensations/feelings), the criterion of identity that is\nnormally applied to individuate acts of thinking does not apply to\nthought (IH 1993: 287). Acts of thinking are individuated and\ndistinguished from one another by adopting spatial criteria. By\ncontrast thoughts (i.e., propositional contents) are individuated on\nthe basis of purely qualitative criteria, so that if there are two\npeople entertaining the (qualitatively) same thought, there is\n(numerically) only one thought since there is only one propositional\ncontent. For Collingwood, if Jane and Jim recite the practical\nsyllogism \u201cAll men are mortal, Socrates is a man, therefore\nSocrates is mortal\u201d they entertain one and the same thought. By\nthe same token, a historian who re-enacts the thought of a past agent\nentertains the very same thought as the historical agent:\n\n\n\u2026 in its immediacy, as an actual experience of his own,\nPlato\u2019s argument must undoubtedly have grown up out of a\ndiscussion of some sort, though I do not know what it was, and been\nclosely connected to such a discussion. Yet if I not only read his\nargument but understand it, follow it in my own mind re-enacting it\nwith and for myself, the process of argument which I go through is not\na process resembling Plato\u2019s, it is actually Plato\u2019s so\nfar as I understand him correctly. (IH 1993: 301)\n\n\nAs the last clause in the quotation makes clear, Collingwood\u2019s\naccount of re-enactment aims to establish a conceptual point about\nwhat exactly it is that historians re-enact (the thought as opposed to\nthe acts of thinking) and what the criteria for identifying and\ndistinguishing thoughts are. It is not meant to prescribe to\nhistorians an empathetic method for the recovery of inner\npsychological processes which are not accessible from a third person\nperspective (Saari 1984 and 1989; Van der Dussen 1981 and 1995;\nD\u2019Oro 2000). Unfortunately the doctrine of re-enactment has been\nwidely read not as attempting to identify the subject matter of\nhistory (thought, rather than acts of thinking), but as seeking to\narticulate a method by which historian can recover hidden\npsychological processes that are not accessible from the third person\nperspective. In the aftermath of the publication of The Idea of\nHistory, the re-enactment doctrine was widely associated with\nDilthey\u2019s account of empathetic understanding and accused of\nascribing to the historian implausible telepathic powers of access to\nother minds (Gardiner 1952a and 1952b).\n\nCollingwood\u2019s account of re-enactment could be criticised for\nover-rationalizing the subject matter of history. His identification\nof the object of re-enactment with \u201cthought\u201d, and of\nhistory as a criteriological or normative inquiry into thought, to the\nexclusion of \u201cfeelings\u201d or \u201csensations\u201d, might\nseem too restrictive since a great deal of action is not rational, and\nirrationality has been the driving force behind much that has happened\nin history. When considering this objection, one must bear in mind\nthat \u201chistory\u201d understood as a form of inquiry distinct\nfrom natural science should not be conflated with\n\u201chistory\u201d as an academic discipline practised in\nuniversity departments. Practising historians will inevitably be\nconcerned with much more than \u201cthought\u201d and the specific\nnorms by which past agents led their lives. They will inevitably\nmention irrational factors, just as they mention arational natural\nforces (earthquakes, floods and other natural phenomena that impact on\nhistorical agents). Collingwood\u2019s goal was not to tell\nhistorians what they can and cannot say about what happened in the\npast, but to distinguish between two very different ways in which the\npast can be approached: under the assumption of the uniformity of\nnature and under the assumption that the deeds of historical agents\nare responses to norms rather than instances of natural laws.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s account of re-enactment certainly implies that the\nhistorical past is in principle knowable, that it is possible to\nmediate reality through the conceptual framework, for example, of the\nancient Egyptians or the ancient Greeks. This is not to say that the\npast can be known in itself, or independently of any conceptual\nmediation, but that it can be seen from the perspective of past\nagents, through the categorial framework that mediated their\nconception of reality. While there are additional epistemic obstacles\nin the way of understanding agents from a distant past, agents who we\ncannot engage in a live conversation, knowledge of the past is in\nprinciple achievable because understanding past agents is not a\nradically different task from that of understanding the thoughts of\nour contemporaries. Historical knowledge, Collingwood says\n\n\nis not concerned only with a remote past. It is by historical thinking\nthat we re-think and so rediscover the thoughts of Hammurabi or Solon,\nit is in the same way that we discover the thought of a friend who\nwrites us a letter, or a friend who crosses the street. (IH 1993:\n219)\n\n\nIn so far as Collingwood\u2019s account of re-enactment defends the\npossibility of knowing the past as it always was for historical agents\n(the historian, as we have seen, seeks to establish what crossing the\nRubicon meant to a Roman cognizant of Republican law) it goes against\na view that became dominant in the latter part of the twentieth\ncentury, according to which the past cannot be known as it always was\nbecause it is constantly and necessarily revised from the perspective\nof the present. This view was endorsed with varying degrees of\nemphasis in the philosophical hermeneutics of H-G. Gadamer, in the\nphilosophy of history, and the philosophy of language. Gadamer\u2019s\nphilosophical hermeneutics claimed that the past \u201cis understood\nonly if it is understood in a different way every time\u201d (1960\n[1975: 275]) because the meaning of a text is the result of a fusion\nof the horizons of the text to be interpreted and the horizon of the\ninterpreter. In the philosophy of history narrativists such as Hayden\nWhite (1973), Frank Ankersmit (1983) and Keith Jenkins (1991)\nemphasised the cultural endowment of the historian as the lens through\nwhich the past is accessed. Even the philosophy of language was not\nimmune from this trend. Quine (1960) famously denied that it is\npossible to achieve determinacy in translation in direct opposition to\nCollingwood\u2019s claim that it is at least in principle possible to\nre-enact the very same thought as the historical agent. This\nrevisionary view of the past goes against Collingwood\u2019s\nconception of what it means to understand the past historically. The\ntask of the historian, as he saw it, is to transport us to another\nworld by immersing oneself in the historical agent\u2019s own context\nof thought.\n3.3 The argument against methodological unity\n\nCollingwood\u2019s philosophy of history is a sustained attempt to\ndelineate the subject matter of history and why this subject matter\ncannot be captured by adopting the methods of natural science. He is\ncritical of the argument, advanced by John Stuart Mill that the\ndistinction between the human and the natural sciences is merely a\ndistinction in the degree of accuracy that can be reached in their\nrespective domains of inquiry. In his System of Logic (1843),\nMill argued that the subject matter of psychology differs from that of\nthe natural sciences because psychology studies human actions. Yet the\nmethod by which the psychologist studies human actions is the same\n(inductive) method that is operative in natural science. Psychologists\npredict human behaviour in the same way in which natural scientists\npredict natural events, by inferring it from certain antecedent\nconditions and empirical generalisations. While the generalisations of\npsychologists invoke psychological rather than natural laws, the\nmethod is the same. The difference between psychology and natural\nscience lies in the fact that the predictions of psychologists unlike,\nsay, those of astronomers are imprecise. Such a difference, for Mill,\nis insufficiently robust to support the claim for disunity in the\nsciences. The most accurate way of drawing the distinction between\npsychology and astronomy is not to deny that psychology is a (natural)\nscience, but to acknowledge that there are two kinds of natural\nsciences, those which are precise (like astronomy) and those which are\nimprecise (like psychology). According to Mill\u2019s way of drawing\nthe distinction psychology is, like tidology and meteorology, an\ninexact (natural) science. The contrast (for Mill) is therefore not\nbetween two kinds of sciences in the Latin sense of scientia,\nmeaning two distinct kinds of knowledge, but between different kinds\nof natural sciences: exact and inexact. Collingwood rejected\nMill\u2019s suggestion that the reconstruction of the thoughts of\nhistorical agents is a past-directed empirical psychology. The study\nof mind is, as we saw earlier, a normative or criteriological\nendeavour because to understand past agents historically is to\nunderstand the conceptual connections they made by reconstructing\ntheir thought-context. The subject matter of history, Collingwood\nclaims, is not merely human actions but res gestae. These\n\n\nare not the actions, in the widest sense of that word, which are done\nby animals of the species called human; they are actions in another\nsense of the same word, equally familiar but narrower, actions done by\nreasonable agents in pursuit of ends determined by their reason. (PH:\n46)\n\n\nPsychology, as understood by Mill, is what in An Essay on\nMetaphysics Collingwood calls a \u201cpseudo-science of\nthought\u201d\u00a0(EM 1998: 142) because it fails to acknowledge\nthat the concept of mind is, in the words of Gallie (1956), an\nessentially contested concept that (like \u201ccause\u201d,\n\u201caction\u201d, \u201cscience\u201d, and \u201cthe\npast\u201d) needs to be disambiguated. This is not to say that\nempirical psychology is not a legitimate scientific pursuit, but that\nthe subject matter of empirical psychology and that of history are not\nthe same and that the attempt to capture the mind by the methods of\nempirical science should be denounced as the attempt by one form of\nknowledge to trespass on the territory of another.\n\nThe distinction between the method of history and that of science is\nnot a distinction between the explanations of psychology understood as\nan empirical science of the mind and those of physics or astronomy. It\nis a distinction between two different forms of knowing with\ndistinctive explananda: actions and events. The action/event\ndistinction designates therefore not a distinction between\ninner/private psychological processes and outward/observable\nphenomena, but between two different ways of knowing the past:\nqua actions or qua events. The description of the\npast qua actions is the correlative of a certain kind of\n(historical) explanation; the description of the past qua\nevents is the correlative of a certain kind of scientific/nomological\nexplanation. The action/event distinction is, in the vocabulary of\nAn Essay on Philosophical Method a philosophical distinction\nwhich does not capture two separate classes of things, but brings the\npast under different descriptions, qua natural and\nqua historical past.\n\nThe relevance of Collingwood\u2019s defence of the autonomy of\nhistory to debates concerning the unity/disunity of science was\nbrought to the attention of a wider audience by W. H. Dray during the\n1950s and 60s. Dray (1958, 1963) located Collingwood\u2019s\naction/event distinction within the context of contemporary debates in\nthe philosophy of social science and drew on the work of Collingwood\nto reject the claim for methodological unity advanced by Hempel in his\ninfluential 1942 article: \u201cThe Function of General Laws in\nHistory\u201d. Hempel claimed that explanations in history are\ncovertly nomological explanations because historians, just as natural\nscientists, rely upon general laws, even if they do not explicitly\nmention them. Dray argued that Hempel failed to see that what\ndistinguishes action from event explanations is the nature of the\nconnection between the explanans and the\nexplanandum. In naturalistic explanations the\nexplanans is an antecedent condition, a state of affairs\nwhich precedes in time the event whose cause it is said to be; in the\nhistorical explanation of action the explanans is the logical\nground of an action, the thought that renders the action intelligible.\nWhilst in the 1950s and 60s Collingwood played an important role in\nthe debate concerning the logical form of action explanation and how\nit differs from the causal explanation of events, his work became less\ninfluential in the second half of the twentieth century. The neglect\ninto which Collingwood\u2019s account of action and its explanation\nhas fallen is linked to a change in metaphilosophical assumptions and\nthe return of the kind of metaphysics which he had sought to replace\nwith the presuppositional analysis described in An Essay on\nMetaphysics.\n\nAs we saw, according to Collingwood the distinction between the\nexplanation of action and of events was a distinction between\ndifferent forms of inferences or, as he put it in An Essay on\nMetaphysics, between the different senses that the term\n\u201ccause\u201d or \u201cbecause\u201d has in different\nexplanatory contexts. Collingwood\u2019s metaphysics of absolute\npresuppositions committed him to a form of explanatory pluralism in\nwhich different kinds of explanations do not compete because they\nanswer different questions, which arise because of different\npresuppositions; the choice between one kind of explanation and\nanother depends on whether they are fit for purpose, i.e., whether\nthey satisfy the curiosity of the person who is asking the question.\nWith the return of a more robust form of metaphysics, the suggestion\nthat the choice between one type of explanation and another could be\nresolved by disambiguating which sense of causation needs to be\ninvoked in order to satisfy the curiosity of the questioner came to be\ndismissed as an attempt to get away with ontologically light weight\nsolutions to the problem of the relation between the science of mind\nand nature. The predominant problem in the philosophy of mind and\naction became that of how the mind can fit in the natural world, a\nquestion which presupposes the kind of metaphysics that Collingwood\nsought to leave behind.\n\nMuch philosophy of history tends to be governed by an epistemological\nconcern with how historical knowledge is possible beginning from the\nassumption that historical knowledge is knowledge of the past. The\nprimary task of a philosophy of history is consequently taken to be\nthat of explaining how the past can be known given that, unlike the\npresent, it is not available for observation, nor can it be reproduced\nunder experimental conditions. Collingwood\u2019s approach to the\nphilosophy of history is quite different. He denied that a mere\nconcern with the past is sufficient to identify a distinctive subject\nmatter for historical inquiry, one which justifies considering history\nas a science, in the Latin sense of scientia, i.e., a form of\nknowing. The past after all is studied by geologists, as well as\nhistorians so if history is a distinctive form of knowing it must do\nmore than merely study the past. He therefore took the primary task of\na philosophy of history to be that of articulating not an\nepistemological theory accounting for how the past can be known, but\nthat of disambiguating the subject matter of history from that of\nnatural science by applying the presuppositional analysis that he had\nexpounded in An Essay on Metaphysics to historical knowledge.\nThe application of this presuppositional analysis yields the claim\nthat the presuppositions of history are different from those of\nnatural science because reenacting the thoughts of past agents\ninvolves re-thinking conceptual connections. Historians presuppose\nthat past agents are responsive to norms, not that their behaviour\nconforms to natural laws. The task of philosophical analysis is to\nuncover these different presuppositions with a view to showing that\nthere is no conflict between the claims of history and those of\nscience, not because historical explanations are incomplete\nnomological explanations, but because they are complete explanations\nof a different kind, which answer different kinds of questions. This\nof course is not to deny that there are important epistemological\nquestions concerning the past but rather that the distinctive\nepistemology of historical knowing can be articulated only once the\nkind of past with which history is concerned is clearly\nidentified:\n\n\n\u2026 a great many things which deeply concern human beings are\nnot, and never have been, traditionally included in the subject-matter\nof history. People are born, eat and breathe and sleep, and beget\nchildren and become ill and recover again, and die; and these things\ninterest them, most of them at any rate, far more than art and\nscience, industry and politics and war. Yet none of these things have\nbeen traditionally regarded as possessing historical interest. Most of\nthem have given rise to institutions like dining and marrying and the\nvarious rituals that surround birth and death, sickness and recovery;\nand of these rituals and institutions people write histories; but the\nhistory of dining is not the history of eating, and the history of\ndeath-rituals is not the history of death. (PH: 46).\n\n\nIf Collingwood\u2019s philosophy of history is an attempt to identify\nthe distinctive subject matter of history and the logical form of\nhistorical judgements, then his metaphilosophy should be understood as\ndefending a form of explanatory pluralism, not a form of historical\nrelativism (D\u2019Oro 2018b). The latter claims that belief systems\nare beyond criticism because truth and falsity are relative to what\ncertain people, at certain times, believe to be true. The former, by\ncontrast, claims that different kinds of explanations are answers to\ndifferent kinds of questions and that the task of philosophical\nanalysis is to undo the conceptual knots in which we get tangled when\nwe fail to order our thoughts with due care. This of course is an\ninterpretative claim that advocates of the radical conversion\nhypothesis (see section 2.3 above) are likely to deny insofar as they\ntend to read Collingwood\u2019s metaphilosophy as articulating not a\ndefence of the autonomy of philosophy, but as dissolving philosophy\ninto a descriptive study of the belief systems that different people\nhad through time.\n",

Van der Dussen), <em>The Principles of\nHistory</em> (edited by W.H. Dray and J. Van der Dussen), <em>The New\nLeviathan</em> (edited by D. Boucher), <em>An Essay on\nMetaphysics</em> (edited by R. Martin), <em>An Essay on Philosophical\nMethod</em> (edited by J. Connelly and G. D\u2019Oro) and <em>The\nPhilosophy of Enchantment</em> (edited by David Boucher, Wendy James\nand Philip Smallwood). However, a significant number of\nCollingwood\u2019s manuscripts are still unpublished. They are\ndeposited in the Bodleian library where copies of the originals can be\nviewed on microfilm. The originals can also be consulted with the\npermission of R.G. Collingwood\u2019s daughter, Teresa Smith. Of\nparticular relevance amongst the unpublished materials are the 1919\nLectures on the Ontological Proof, the Central Problems of Metaphysics\nand the Lectures on Moral Philosophy. The first is a substantial and\nquite polished discussion of the ontological argument (almost 100\npages), the second is also a very substantial piece dealing with the\nrealism/idealism antinomy. The material on moral philosophy is very\nextensive. Collingwood wrote and rewrote the Lectures on Moral\nPhilosophy through the 1920s and very early 30s. Each time he added a\nmethodological introduction. The methodological introductions\neventually took on a life of their own and they were eventually\npublished as <em>An Essay on Philosophical Method</em> in 1933. The\n1929 and 1932 versions of the methodological introductions deserve a\nspecial mention as they shed a great deal of light on\nCollingwood\u2019s conception of philosophical method.</p>\n<p>\nFor a complete list of the unpublished manuscripts by R. G.\nCollingwood, see Connelly, Johnson and Leach (eds.) 2014. The\nfollowing is a very selective list of material which is still\nunpublished and is currently available in the Bodleian library.</p>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">",

Van der Dussen), <em>The Principles of\nHistory</em> (edited by W.H. Dray and J. Van der Dussen), <em>The New\nLeviathan</em> (edited by D. Boucher), <em>An Essay on\nMetaphysics</em> (edited by R. Martin), <em>An Essay on Philosophical\nMethod</em> (edited by J. Connelly and G. D\u2019Oro) and <em>The\nPhilosophy of Enchantment</em> (edited by David Boucher, Wendy James\nand Philip Smallwood). However, a significant number of\nCollingwood\u2019s manuscripts are still unpublished. They are\ndeposited in the Bodleian library where copies of the originals can be\nviewed on microfilm. The originals can also be consulted with the\npermission of R.G. Collingwood\u2019s daughter, Teresa Smith. Of\nparticular relevance amongst the unpublished materials are the 1919\nLectures on the Ontological Proof, the Central Problems of Metaphysics\nand the Lectures on Moral Philosophy. The first is a substantial and\nquite polished discussion of the ontological argument (almost 100\npages), the second is also a very substantial piece dealing with the\nrealism/idealism antinomy. The material on moral philosophy is very\nextensive. Collingwood wrote and rewrote the Lectures on Moral\nPhilosophy through the 1920s and very early 30s. Each time he added a\nmethodological introduction. The methodological introductions\neventually took on a life of their own and they were eventually\npublished as <em>An Essay on Philosophical Method</em> in 1933. The\n1929 and 1932 versions of the methodological introductions deserve a\nspecial mention as they shed a great deal of light on\nCollingwood\u2019s conception of philosophical method.</p>\n<p>\nFor a complete list of the unpublished manuscripts by R.
