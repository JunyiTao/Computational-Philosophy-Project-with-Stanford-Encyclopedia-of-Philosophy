    "main_text": "Human Nature and the Person || The Two-Tier Self: Transcendental and Empirical\n4.2 The Two-Tier Self: Transcendental and Empirical\n\nThe broad picture is shared by all three. As elucidated above, all\naccepted that knowledge of human nature and moral values has to be\nsubjective and intuitive, not empirical. Following the Mengzi-Wang\nYangming strand of Confucianism, the goodness of human nature consists\nof a set of basic moral responses which everyone feels and, when not\nobstructed by selfishness, do not err. The questions of what the\ngoodness of human nature means, how we know it, and how we can realize\nit in life are fundamental to most of Mou Zongsan\u2019s and Tang\nJunyi\u2019s philosophical work, so their answers require some\ndetail. These will be followed by some examination of Xu\nFuguan\u2019s less metaphysical approach.\n\nThe issue of desires had loomed large in Buddhist and Neo-Confucian\nthought, and one task for Mou and Tang was to distinguish\nself-centered desires from the moral responses. The feeling of wanting\nto eat a favorite food and the feeling of wanting to save a stranger\nfrom harm are not the same category of thing. The challenge for them\nis that both the former and latter seem to be part of human nature, if\nthat means universal, unlearned feelings and behaviors. If anything,\nthe self-centered desires seem more universal. And yet, for Tang,\nfollowing Mengzi, it is important to distinguish human beings and\nanimals. Mou put it slightly differently: \u201cPeople have an animal\nnature and a human nature\u201d (MZCW 9a: 71). The point is much the\nsame: being human means controlling and overcoming desires. What they\nwant to do is to demonstrate that everyone has the category of moral\nresponses, even if they rarely act on them. That is human nature\nproperly understood.\n\nMou and Tang both address this challenge by appealing to two levels of\nthe person: an empirical self which experiences desires, and a true or\ntranscendent self constituted by the moral responses. Since that true\nself belongs to a higher ontological level, it represents what the\nperson truly is, and that is what we should follow. The model here is\nrecognizably Kantian, distinguishing moral responses which proceed\nfrom free will and the true self from inclinations or desires which\nare part of appearances. It is not surprising that Kant made such an\nimpact on modern Confucian philosophers, Mou and Tang especially. The\nexperience of moral responses is also critical for both of them, as\nthe reality of the true self has to be grasped practically rather than\ntheoretically (Wong 2021).\n\nWe saw earlier how Mou argued that intellectual intuition is a reality\nfor human beings and so knowledge of the free will is possible and\nmorality is real. Mou develops this view into what he calls moral\nmetaphysics (in contrast to Kant\u2019s metaphysics of morals),\nbecause morality is the basis for metaphysical truths, namely the\nreality of the autonomous self (Billioud 2012: 49\u201350; Lee 2013:\n24). The true self for Mou cannot be an appearance but must be a thing\nin itself, belonging to the intelligible world. Only then is free will\npossible. If it were part of the world of appearances, it would be\nsubject to causal laws and be determined or affected by things\nexternal to it. Then morality would not exist. The source of\nmorality\u2014which Mou calls free will, the fundamental mind\n(benxin \u672c\u5fc3), or human nature as reality\n(xingti \u6027\u9ad4)\u2014has to be absolute and\nunconditional, not an appearance (MZCW 20: 245\u201347). The primary\ndifference between Mou and Kant concerns the nature and role of\nfeelings (Lee 1990: 37\u201342). For Kant, feelings were appearances\nand could not be the basis of morality. For Mou, ordinary feelings\n(such as desires) belong to the world of appearances and are\nheteronomous motivations. But there is another category of moral\nfeelings which are different.\n\nMou claims that there is another type of feeling entirely which\nbelongs to (or is) the true self, the autonomous person as a thing in\nitself. These are rational feelings, not sensible (MZCW 22: 14). He\ncreated several terms for these feelings, such as \u201cmoral\nfeelings of illuminating awareness\u201d (mingjue jueqing\n\u660e\u89ba\u89ba\u60c5) or \u201contological moral\nfeelings\u201d (bentilun de jueqing\n\u672c\u9ad4\u8ad6\u7684\u89ba\u60c5) (Billioud 2012:\n170\u201376; Lee 2021: 259\u201360). The moral responses identified\nby Mengzi belong to this category. Mengzi illustrated these feelings\nby considering the situation of a person seeing a child about to fall\ninto a well. In such a case, he claimed, anyone would have a feeling\nof alarm and compassion toward the child (Mengzi 2A6). For\nMou, this sort of situation is the way we become aware of the true\nself through the moral reaction, a process that he calls reflective\nverification (one aspect of intellectual intuition [MZCW 20:\n252]):\n\n\nThis awakening due to astonishment is like the red sun rising out of\nbottom of the sea; it is not at all sensible. Therefore, the\nreflective verification in question is the illuminating awareness of\nintellect itself reflecting its own light back onto itself and not a\nphenomenal mind different from itself sensibly and passively coming to\ncognize it, which could never reach it in itself. So this reflective\nunderstanding is purely intellectual and not the passivity of\nsensibility. (MZCW 21: 105)\n\n\nOne key point here is that this reflective verification has both\nepistemic and moral significance. It is a way we come to realize the\ntrue self, in both the senses of knowing it and making it real and\nactive (Billioud 2012: 198\u2013207; Shi & Lin 2015: 553). When\nwe have such a response, we know the true self (the fundamental mind,\nnature in itself) and are prompted to act on it. Because the\nmoral responses come from the true self as a thing in itself and are\nnot part of the sensible world, they are not heteronomous and\nautonomous morality is possible. The important moral distinction for\nMou is not between reason and inclination, as in Kant, but between two\ndifferent kinds of feeling: intellectual or ontological feeling (from\nthe true self) and sensible feeling (from the empirical self).\n\nGranting Mou\u2019s claim that the moral feelings belong to the true\nself and are categorically different from empirical feelings, what he\ndoes not explain is how an agent can reliably discern which is which.\nMorality is not a matter of acting on a rational, universalizable\nprinciple, which an agent could deliberate about, but acting on the\nprompting of the fundamental mind. It is not a biological instinct,\nbut subjectively can feel similar as something the agent is compelled\nto do in a non-rational way (Shi & Lin 2015: 547\u201348). From\nthe agent\u2019s internal perspective then, it may be difficult or\nimpossible to tell what is a moral response belonging to the\nfundamental mind and what is a desire or instinct from the empirical\nself (Suter 2018: 229). As there is no further objective criterion to\njudge what is right or wrong, whether Mou\u2019s moral metaphysics\ncan adequately guide action is a concern (Shi & Lin 2015: 559).\nThis is not to deny that the true self may be a reality in the way\nthat he describes, but to raise the question of whether we can\nreliably tell when we\u2019re accessing the fundamental mind and when\nwe\u2019re not.\n",
