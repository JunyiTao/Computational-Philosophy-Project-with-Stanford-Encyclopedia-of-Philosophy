    "main_text": "Work on Modal Logic || Prior and Possible Worlds Semantics\n2.3 Prior and Possible Worlds Semantics\n\n\nPrior\u2019s detailed contributions to the development of modal\nlogic are legion. At least one aspect of his work has not received the\nrecognition it deserves. Several years ahead of Kripke, Prior and his\ncollaborator Carew Meredith invented crucial elements of the possible\nworlds semantics for propositional modal logic, including the\nall-important binary relation, which opens the way to modelling systems\nof different strengths. Meredith was a lecturer in mathematics at\nTrinity College, Dublin; his interest in logic had been stimulated by\nthe arrival of \u0141ukasiewicz in Dublin shortly after the second\nworld war.\n\n\nPrior foreshadowed his later work on possible worlds semantics in\nThe Craft. Discussing work by Boole, he wrote:\n\n\n\nWhat Boole was after might perhaps have been plainer if he had said\nsomething like this: There is one \u2018hypothetical Universe\u2019,\nwhich contains the totality of what we might call possibilities, or if\nyou like, \u2018possible worlds\u2019. (1951: 462.)\n\n\n\nThen in the penultimate chapter of The Craft he said:\n\n\n\nFor the similarity in behaviour between signs of modality and signs\nof quantity, various explanations may be offered. It may be, for\nexample, that signs of modality are just ordinary quantifiers operating\nupon a peculiar subject-matter, namely possible states of affairs\n\u2026 It would not be quite accurate to describe theories of this\nsort as \u2018reducing modality to quantity\u2019. They do reduce\nmodal distinctions to distinctions of quantity, but the\nvariables to which the quantifiers are attached retain something modal\nin their signification \u2014 they signify\n\u2018possibilities\u2019, \u2018chances\u2019, \u2018possible\nstates of affairs\u2019, \u2018possible combinations of\ntruth-values\u2019, or the like. (1951: 736\u20137.)\n\n\n\nAs sources for these ideas Prior cited John Wallis (a seventeenth\ncentury mathematician) and the account of logically necessary and\nlogically impossible propositions given by Wittgenstein in the\nTractatus (1951: 737). Interestingly, he mentioned Carnap only\nin a footnote: \u2018Professor Carnap has a similar definition of\nlogical necessity in terms of what he calls\n\u201cstate-descriptions\u201d\u2019 (ibid). Prior did not refer to,\nand presumably had not at that time read, Carnap\u2019s 1946 paper\n\u2018Modalities and Quantification\u2019, which attempted a\nsemantics for quantified S5 in terms of state-descriptions. (A\nstate-description is a class of sentences satisfying certain\nconditions; each state-description represents a possible state of\naffairs.) Carnap too cited the Tractatus account of modal\npropositions as his inspiration (1946: 47).\n\n\nPrior goes on in The Craft to defend his account of\nmodality as quantification over possible states of affairs against\nvarious alternatives, for example the Andersonian account, according to\nwhich \u2018Every table here is necessarily brown\u2019 means\n\u2018There is a property which every table here in fact possesses,\nand of which it is true that everything that possesses it is in fact\nbrown\u2019. John Anderson, Professor at the University of Sydney, was\na leading figure in the development of philosophy in Australasia.\n\n\nIn 1956 Prior wrote up (and circulated in mimeograph form) his and\nMeredith\u2019s formal work on what he later described (1962a: 140) as\nthe \u2018logic of world-accessibility\u2019, in a paper entitled\n\u2018Interpretations of Different Modal Logics in the \u201cProperty\nCalculus\u201d\u2019 (Meredith and Prior 1956, first published in\nCopeland 1996). It carried the attribution \u2018C.A.M., August 1956;\nrecorded and expanded A.N.P.\u2019. Prior mentioned this paper in\nPast, Present and Future (1967: 42\u20135) and in his 1962 articles\n\u2018Possible Worlds\u2019 and \u2018Tense-Logic and the Continuity\nof Time\u2019. The paper seems to have been the earliest to employ a\nbinary relation between points in order to discriminate between S5 and\nweaker systems, the points being regarded as possible states of\naffairs. Carnap\u2019s pioneering 1946 paper concerned only S5 and\ncontained no such relation.\n\n\nThe property calculus is essentially a variation of Prior\u2019s\n1954 \\(l\\)-calculus described above. In the \\(l\\)-calculus,\ntense-modal propositions are treated as predicates expressing\nproperties of dates, and quantification theory is supplemented with\nvarious special axioms for a binary relation \u2018\\(l\\)\u2019\ntaking dates as arguments. In the modal version of the calculus,\nsentences of modal logic are treated as if they express properties of\ncertain objects \\(a, b, c\\), etc. Objects are\nrelated by a binary relation \\(U\\). In their 1956 paper Prior and\nMeredith supplied no account of what a formula of form\n\u2018\\(Uab\\)\u2019 might express. They gave the following\ndefinitions of necessity \\(\\Box\\) and possibility \\(\\Diamond\\), where\n\u2018\\(pa\\)\u2019 indicates that object \\(a\\) has the\nproperty expressed by the sentence \\(p\\).\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n(\\Box p)a &= \\forall x(Uax \\rightarrow px) \\\\\n(\\Diamond p)a &= \\exists x(Uax \\amp px).\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\n(Following \u0141ukasiewicz, Prior and Meredith themselves used\n\u2018L\u2019 in place of \u2018\\(\\Box\\)\u2019 and \u2018M\u2019\nin place of \u2018\\(\\Diamond\\)\u2019.) Their calculus consisted of ordinary\nquantification theory supplemented by these definitions, together with\ncertain axioms governing the relation \\(U\\)\u2014see\nbelow\u2014and the following clauses:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n(\\neg p)a &= \\neg (pa) \\\\\n(p \\rightarrow q)a &= (pa) \\rightarrow (qa). \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nIt is implied in the 1956 paper that a proposition \\(p\\) is to\nbe called a theorem of the calculus if and only if \\(pa\\) is\nprovable for an arbitrarily chosen object \\(a\\).\n\n\nAxioms for \\(U\\) are selected from a list containing (among\nothers):\n\n\n\n1. \\(Uaa\\) \\((U\\) is reflexive)\n\n\n2. \\(Uab \\rightarrow (Ubc \\rightarrow Uac)\\)\n(\\(U\\) is transitive)\n\n\n3. \\(Uab \\rightarrow Uba\\) (\\(U\\) is symmetrical).\n\n\n\nAxiom 2 was also present in the 1954 \\(l\\)-calculus.\n\n\nPrior and Meredith stated in their 1956 paper that the distribution\nprinciple \\(\\Box(p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow \n(\\Box p \\rightarrow \\Box q)\\) is a theorem in the\nabsence of any special axioms for \\(U\\); that \\(\\Box p \\rightarrow p\\) is a theorem if axiom 1 is imposed; that axiom 2\ngives the S4 principle \\(\\Box p \\rightarrow \\Box \\Box p\\); and that 2 together with 3 give the S5\nprinciple \\(\\Diamond \\Box p \\rightarrow \\Box p\\). Their\napproach was proof-theoretic in its basic orientation and they offered\nno completeness results. In (1962a) and (1962b) Prior extended this\napproach to systems between S4 and S5, and to systems independent of S4\nbetween T and S5.\n\n\nWhat of the meaning of the binary relation \\(U\\)? As previously\nremarked, the idea that the variables of quantification of the calculus\nshould range over possible states of affairs or possible worlds is\npresent in The Craft. In 1960, following a suggestion by\nGeach, Prior began thinking of \\(U\\) as a relation of\naccessibility between worlds. Prior tells us that Geach cashed\nout the notion of \u2018reaching\u2019 one world from another in\nterms of \u2018some dimension-jumping vehicle dreamed up by science\nfiction\u2019 (1962b: 36; see also 1962a: 140). (Geach referred to the\nwhole business as \u2018Trans World Airlines\u2019.) With this\ninterpretation of \\(U\\) to hand, the property calculus can be\nviewed as treating \\((\\Box p)a\\) \u2014 or\n\u2018Necessarily\\(-p\\) in world \\(a\\)\u2019 \u2014 as\nshort for \u2018\\(p\\) is true in all worlds accessible from\n\\(a\\)\u2019.\n\n\nLemmon, in a draft of material intended for his and Dana\nScott\u2019s projected book \u2018Intensional Logic\u2019,\nmistakenly credited Geach with the idea that the binary relation\n\u2018may be intuitively thought of as a relation between possible\nworlds\u2019. In a letter to Scott, written after Lemmon\u2019s death\nin 1966, Prior remarked: \u2018What Geach contributed was not the\ninterpretation of \\([U]\\) as a relation between worlds (God knows\nwhen that started), but the interpretation of \\([U]\\) as\na relation of accessibility\u2019. When Prior said \u2018God knows\nwhen that started\u2019 he was presumably referring to the\nidea that the \u2018objects\u2019 of the calculus be regarded as\npossible worlds. He was right to think that the history of this idea is\na tangled one. Priority is often assigned to Leibniz, but scholars have\ntraced the idea back to Duns Scotus and William of Ockham (Knuuttila\n1993).\n\n\nIt seems that the binary relation first made its appearance in a\n1951 article by Jonsson and Tarski, \u2018Boolean Algebras with\nOperators\u2019. In their Theorem 3.14 they established that every\nclosure algebra is isomorphic to an algebraic system formed by a set\nand a reflexive and transitive relation between its elements; their\nTheorem 3.5 considered also a symmetry condition. In hindsight, these\ntheorems (which explicitly concerned boolean algebras) can be viewed as\nin effect a treatment of all the basic modal axioms and corresponding\nproperties of the accessibility relation. Concerning this article, Saul\nKripke remarked (in Copeland 1996: 13):\n\n\n\nHad they known they were doing modal logic, they would have had the\ncompleteness problem for many of the modal propositional systems\nwrapped up, and some powerful theorems. Mathematically they did this,\nbut it was presented as algebra with no mention of semantics, modal\nlogic, or possible worlds, let alone quantifiers. When I presented my\npaper at the conference in Finland in 1962, I emphasized the importance\nof this paper. Tarski was present, and said that he was unable to see\nany connection with what I was doing!\n\n\n\nDuring the next eight years the binary relation was reinvented by a\nnumber of logicians. Prior, in his address to a conference in\nWellington in 1954, seems to have been the first to use the binary\nrelation in an explicitly tense-modal context. Other landmarks were an\naddress by Montague to a conference held at UCLA in 1955\n(Montague\u2019s binary relation held between models rather than\npoints or indices interpretable as worlds, and the notion of a possible\nworld was absent), Prior and Meredith\u2019s property calculus of\n1956, lectures by Smiley in Cambridge in 1957 (Smiley pursued an\nalgebraic approach), Kanger (1957), Hintikka (1957, 1961) and Kripke\n(1959a, 1959b, 1963). Kripke was familiar with Kanger\u2019s work\ninvolving the binary relation at the time he obtained his own results.\nKanger himself had read the 1951 paper by Jonsson and Tarski and he\ndescribed his results as similar to theirs (Kanger 1957: 39). (Copeland\n(2002) gives a detailed history of possible worlds semantics.)\n\n\nTo the modern eye, Prior\u2019s 1956 possible worlds semantics looks\nfamiliar yet also strange. There is no semantic ascent, and there are\nno frames, models, valuations, satisfaction clauses or truth\nconditions. Prior\u2019s modal semantics belongs to a pre-modern era,\nthe era of \u2018translational\u2019 semantics, a type of semantics\nthat pre-dated the meteoric rise of Tarski-style truth-conditional\nsemantics in the 1960s and 1970s (Copeland 2016). A translational\nsemantics translates the targeted sentences into a more illuminating\nlanguage, such as Prior\u2019s enriched predicate calculus. For\nanyone who understands Prior\u2019s augmented predicate calculus, his\ntranslational clauses, such as \\((\\Diamond p)a = \\exists x(Uax \\amp\npx),\\) offer both an explanation of the meanings of the modal\noperators and an account of how the meanings of complex sentences\n(e.g. the S4 and S5 axioms) arise recursively from the meanings of\ntheir parts.\n",
