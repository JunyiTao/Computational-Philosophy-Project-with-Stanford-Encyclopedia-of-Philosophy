    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues || The Analytic-Synthetic Distinction\n5.3 The Analytic-Synthetic Distinction\n\nOne long-standing issue about ambiguity is that it assumes a\ndifference between something like sense and reference. While some\nwords can clearly be used to refer to things that are wildly different\nin ontic category, that has not been taken to be sufficient for a\nclaim to ambiguity. In theory, a phrase could be ambiguous and yet\ndiffer not at all in reference: imagine a term t that was\nambiguous between two meanings, but it turned out as highly surprising\nessential condition that things that were t in the first\nsense were also t in the second sense \u2013 while this seems\nunlikely to happen, it is by no means conceptually impossible.\n\nHowever, the 20th century saw a vicious and sometimes relentless\nattack on the distinction between facts about meaning and facts about\nreference (see the entry on the \n  analytic/synthetic distinction). \n  If the line between these two is blurry, there will very\nlikely be cases in which the line between ambiguity and\nsense-generality is blurry as well (and not just epistemologically).\nLet\u2019s indulge in some possible-world anthropology on a group\nthat uses a term, \u2018gavagai\u2019 (Quine 1960). Furthermore, I\nstipulate (perhaps counter-possibly) that the world is a\nfour-dimensional world with respect to the referent of\n\u2018gavagai\u2019 so if they refer at all with\n\u2018gavagai\u2019, they refer to something made up of stages. Now\nwe sit down to write the lexicon of the world\u2019s inhabitants and\nwe come to \u2018gavagai\u2019. We write:\n\n\n\u2018Gavagai\u2019 (ga-vuh-guy): (N, sing.):\n\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to know what to write down for this entry as\nit\u2019s not obvious what counts as semantic content for the word\nand what counts as information about the referent of the word. For\nexample, say they clearly think that the referent of\n\u2018gavagai\u2019 is something that does not have temporal parts.\nDoes this mean that they fail to refer to rabbits with\n\u2018gavagai\u2019 or that they are mistaken about their nature? If\nthis question is hard to answer, we can generalize to harder cases:\nsay that some of the \u2018rabbits\u2019 in this world are\nthree-dimensional and some four- dimensional. Should we countenance an\nambiguity in \u2018gavagai\u2019 given that the people use it\nindiscriminately to refer to both? Should we posit a lexical ambiguity\nwith two different definitions for \u2018gavagai\u2019?\n\nThis case may be far-fetched; but we have a real live cases of it.\nField (1973) discusses the case of the term \u2018mass\u2019, which seems to have been\nthought to pick out one property of objects but in fact picks out two\nthat are really very different in character. Deciding whether this is\na surprising case of disjunctive reference, or an indeterminacy in\nreference is no easy task, but the decision has ramifications for\nwhether or not we categorize \u2018mass\u2019 as ambiguous or highly\nsense-general (and if sense-general, what is the general sense?)\n",
