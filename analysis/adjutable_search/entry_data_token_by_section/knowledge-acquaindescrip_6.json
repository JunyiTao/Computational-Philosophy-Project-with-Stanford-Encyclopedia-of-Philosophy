    "main_text": "Acquaintance and Inferential Knowledge\n5. Acquaintance and Inferential Knowledge\n\nAn acquaintance theorist aiming to provide a general account of\nknowledge owes us an account not only of noninferential knowledge, but\nalso of inferential knowledge. How can we get at least reasonable or\njustified belief when we are not directly acquainted with the truth\nmakers of those beliefs, the facts that make the beliefs true? Again,\nwe stress that the question we are concerned with here is not how we\ncan get knowledge of truths in contrast to knowledge of something\nother than a truth. We have already suggested that knowledge by\nacquaintance should be thought of as knowledge of a truth made\npossible by acquaintance with the truth maker. The question, rather,\nconcerns how we can get knowledge of a truth when we are not\nacquainted with the truth maker. For the classical acquaintance\ntheorist, that question, in turn, reduces to the question of how we\ncan acquire knowledge through inference.\n\nThere are at least two possible answers the acquaintance theorist\nmight give. A view we might call inferential externalism suggests that\nto acquire inferential knowledge that Q by inferring\nQ from P it is enough that P makes highly\nprobable Q. The relation of making probable, itself, can be\ninterpreted in many different ways. A detailed discussion of\ninterpretations of probability would take us too far afield, so let us\nbe content with a few very brief remarks (see the entry on\n interpretations of probability).\n One might try to understand probability in terms of frequency.\nRoughly the idea is that P makes Q probable when\nP and Q form a pair of propositions of a certain\nkind, where usually when the first member of a pair of propositions of\nthat sort is true then so is the second. Alternatively, some\nphilosophers would follow Keynes (1921) and argue that there are\nrelations of making probable that hold between propositions analogous\n(in some ways) to the relation of entailment that holds between\npropositions. On this view, when P makes probable Q,\nit is a necessary truth that P makes probable Q\n(though that necessary truth is perfectly consistent with the fact\nthat the conjunction of P and X might not make\nprobable Q).\n\nMost classical foundationalists at least implicitly rejected the idea\nthat the mere obtaining of a probability relation between one\u2019s\nnoninferential evidence that P and the proposition Q\none infers from that evidence is sufficient to acquire inferential\njustification or inferential knowledge. Rather, they insisted, one\nmust be aware of or have access to the probabilistic connection that\nobtains between one\u2019s premises and one\u2019s conclusion.\nDirect acquaintance with facts was proposed to end a potentially\nvicious regress of justification\n (see section 3),\n but now the regress looms again in connection with knowledge of\nprobabilistic connections. How can one get knowledge of probabilistic\nconnections between premises and conclusions? If one infers the\nexistence of the probabilistic connections from the truth of some\nother different proposition F, then one not only needs\njustification for believing F, but, one needs justification\nfor believing that F does indeed make probable that the\nprobabilistic connection holds! The problem here is essentially the\none that has been pointed out by Lewis Carroll (1895), though he\napplied the problem to deductive inference. BonJour (2005) cites this\nproblem as a reason for taking a direct, nonpropositional grasp of\nlogical relations as crucial to inferential justification, at least\nfor deductive inferences; similarly, Fumerton (2015) argues that, to\nhalt the regress, the internalist should require a direct awareness of\nrelations of making probable between propositions. But are we aware of\nsuch relations? The problem seems hopeless if one understands\nprobability in terms of frequency, for we do not seem to have any\ndirect access to such complex, contingent facts as the ratio that one\nproposition is true relative to another (logically independent) one.\nThat seems to be the sort of thing one can only know by extensive\nobservation, data gathering, or empirical research, and the question\nof how we know that some observation makes probable our judgment of\nprobability arises all over again. But if one can convince oneself\nthat there are real logical relations of making probable holding\nbetween propositions, then perhaps the acquaintance theorist can\nsecure the required knowledge of those connections once again through\nacquaintance. Ramsey (1926) famously objected that we do not seem to\nperceive such relations of making probable, but Hasan (2017) argues\nthat these objections are weak, and that there are good reasons to\nthink we can be directly aware of such relations. This version of the\nacquaintance theory relies critically on the fundamental concept of\nacquaintance in understanding both noninferential and inferential\nknowledge. Noninferential knowledge is secured by direct acquaintance\nwith truth makers. Inferential knowledge is secured by direct\nacquaintance with logical and probabilistic connections between known\npropositions and other propositions.\n",
