In light of later arguments, it should also be pointed\nout that it is not, in fact, measurement but the erasure of the\nmeasurement outcome that generates the entropy production in Szilard's\nexample.\n\n\nSzilard's argument was developed further after Shannon identified\nthat the measure p\u2009ln\u2009p had operational\nsignificance for information theory, suggestive of a deeper connection\nbetween entropy and information. To illustrate the idea further, both\nGabor (1964) and Brillouin (1951) constructed specific models of\ndissipative measurement that involve shining a light into one side of\nthe engine to see whether that side contains the molecule. The light is\nscattered if the molecule is on that side, but is not scattered if the\nmolecule is not present. However, if the system, including the\nelectromagnetic field itself, is in thermal equilibrium then there is\nbackground radiation at that temperature with a blackbody spectrum. To\nsee the scattered light it must be distinguishable from the background\nradiation. This requires a photon with energy much higher than the mean\nenergy of the blackbody spectrum,\n so\n \u210f\u2009\u03bd \u226b k\u2009T.\nA photon must be used whose energy is greater than the energy gained\nfrom the operation of the engine, thereby precluding a net conversion\nof heat into work.\n\n\nBrillouin, in particular, attempted to develop this idea into a\ngeneral theory of the relationship between information and entropy.\nBrillouin now identified entropy with the Gibbs entropy of a system. He\ndistinguished two kinds of information: \u2018bound\u2019 information and \u2018free\u2019\ninformation. Bound information refers strictly to information which is\nembodied in the states of physical systems. Information which is, for\nexample, only contained in someone's mind, according to Brillouin, is\nfree, not bound. Performing a measurement could reduce the\nthermodynamic entropy of a system, but to do so requires the creation\nof an equivalent quantity of bound information in the device which\nholds the outcome of the measurement. However, it is not entirely clear\nif Brillouin's argument was that the creation of bound information is\nnecessarily associated with compensating entropy production, as the\narguments based upon scattered photons suggest, or if the bound\ninformation in itself is an additional term that must be added to\nnormal entropy to produce a generalised second law.\n",
