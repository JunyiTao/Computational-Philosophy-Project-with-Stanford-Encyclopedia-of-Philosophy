    "main_text": "Moral Disagreement and the Semantics (and Metasemantics) of Moral Language || Disagreement and Charity\n5.1 Disagreement and Charity\n\n\nAn early contribution to the debate was made by Richard Hare (1952,\nesp. 146\u2013149, but see also Stevenson 1963, and Blackburn 1984 and 1993,\nch. 11). He imagined a scenario with two facts which he assumed could\nco-exist. The first is the fact that different sets of speakers\nsystematically apply \u201cgood\u201d to different persons and\nactions and on the basis of different criteria of application with\nlittle overlap. The second is the fact that they all use \u201cgood\u201d\nas, in Hare\u2019s phrase, a \u201cgeneral adjective of\ncommendation\u201d. According to Hare, the first fact implies that\nthere is no single property which \u201cgood\u201d is used to refer\nto by all speakers in the scenario. That is, supposing that the term is\nused to refer at all, the fact suggests that it refers to different\nproperties for different speakers. This in turn means that their\ndisputes about how to apply \u201cgood\u201d need not reflect any\nconflicts of belief, as the belief that an item has one property is\ncompatible with its lacking some other property (provided that the\nproperties are appropriately distinct). Hare\u2019s point, however,\nwas that, in virtue of the second fact, it would still be plausible to\ninterpret those speakers as being in in a genuine moral dispute when\narguing about whether to apply \u201cgood\u201d or not. Hare took\nthis conclusion to suggest that moral disagreements are best seen as\nclashes of commands rather than as conflicts of belief and provided the\nargument in support of his non-cognitivist view that the\n(\u201cprimary\u201d) function of moral terms and sentences is to\nexpress such commands.\n\n\nA common realist response to the argument is to question whether the\ndifferences in language use which are assumed in Hare\u2019s scenario\nreally do rule out co-reference. Whether it does is a metasemantical\nquestion. On a metasemantical view which potentially vindicates\nHare\u2019s contention, we interpret the referential terms of a\nspeaker correctly only if we assign referents \u201ccharitably\u201d.\nAn assignment is charitable in the relevant sense if, given the\nassignment, most or many of the speaker\u2019s ascriptions of the\nterms come out true (e.g., Davidson 1973; and Lewis 1983). On that\nview, it does indeed seem hard to reconcile co-reference with a lack of\nconvergence or agreement regarding how a term of the pertinent kind is\nto be applied. However, the charity-based approach is challenged by\nother metasemantical positions, including those which take the\nreference of at least some terms to be determined in ways that allow\nfor more error. By invoking such a position, a realist could\npotentially deny Hare\u2019s conclusion that the speakers in his\nscenario use \u201cgood\u201d to refer (if at all) to different\nproperties.\n",
