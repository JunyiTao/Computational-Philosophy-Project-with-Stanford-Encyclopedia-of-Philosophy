    "main_text": "Historical Contingency\n6. Historical Contingency\n\nStephen Jay Gould (1989) famously argued that evolutionary history is\ncontingent. George Gaylord Simpson (1963) foreshadowed that claim when\nhe suggested that paleontology is a distinctively historical science\nthat seeks to understand \u201cconfigurational change\u201d. Gould\nclaimed that if we could rewind the tape of history to some point in\nthe deep past and play it back again, the outcome would probably be\ndifferent.\n\nGould\u2019s thinking about contingency has had significant impacts\nin both philosophy and biology. In philosophy, for instance, John\nBeatty (1995) argued that the contingency of evolutionary history\nimplies that there are no distinctively biological laws, an argument\nthat served as a touchstone for much of the subsequent debate about\nlaws in biology (Brandon 1997; Mitchell 1997, 2000, 2002; Sober 1997;\nGiere 1999; Shapiro 2000; Woodward 2000, 2001, 2004; Elgin 2003, 2006;\nand Hamilton 2007; for important precursors to Beatty 1995, see Smart\n1963; Ruse 1970; Cartwright 1983; van Fraassen 1989; and Rosenberg\n1994). More recently, Beatty (2016) has argued that the contingency of\nevolutionary history is closely connected to narrative modes of\nexplanation. His suggestion is that narrative explanations are\nespecially well suited to historically contingent series of events.\nMcConwell (2017) argues that the contingency of evolutionary history\nexplains why we should be pluralists about biological individuality.\nIn biology, on the other hand, Gould\u2019s argument about\ncontingency, particularly his thought experiment concerning rewinding\nand playing back the tape of history, helped to inspire research in\nlong-term experimental evolution (e.g., Travisano, Mangold, Bennett,\n& Lenski 1995). In addition to fueling interest in understanding\nthe Cambrian explosion, Gould\u2019s work also instigated something\nof a backlash from other scientists convinced that selection-driven\nconvergence is the hallmark of evolutionary history (e.g., Conway\nMorris 2003). This debate concerning contingency and convergence\nsometimes also has theological overtones. Conway Morris has at least\nhinted that he sees convergentism about evolution as cohering\nespecially well with theism. This contrasts with Gould\u2019s\nwell-known view that science and religion should be regarded as\n\u201cnon-overlapping magisteria\u201d (Gould 1997).\n\nThere is some question about just what Gould meant by the term\n\u2018contingency\u2019. Some philosophers read him as meaning that\ndownstream outcomes are sensitive to small changes in upstream\nconditions (Ben-Menahem 1997; Inkpen & Turner 2012). On this\nreading, contingency comes in degrees, and in contrast with historical\ninsensitivity to changes in upstream conditions, which we\ncould think of as historical convergence or robustness. When, for\nexample, Sterelny (1995, crediting F. Jackson & Pettit 1992) talks\nabout \u201crobust process explanations\u201d, he means explanations\nthat show how an outcome would have resulted from a wide range of\nupstream conditions.\n\nBeatty (2006), however, has shown that there are two different senses\nof \u2018contingency\u2019 in play in Gould\u2019s work. In\naddition to what Beatty calls contingency as causal\ndependence\u2014basically, sensitivity to initial\nconditions\u2014there is a second form of contingency that Beatty\ninitially called contingency as unpredictability, but now calls\ncontingency per se (Beatty 2016). These two senses of\ncontingency correspond with two versions of the famous thought\nexperiment that Gould (1989) deployed. Sometimes, Gould imagines\nrewinding the tape of history, tweaking an upstream variable, and then\nplaying the tape back. On other occasions, he talks about playing the\ntape back from the same initial conditions. Beatty (2016) thinks that\nboth senses of \u2018contingency\u2019 are important, and he takes\nit that the second sense\u2014contingency per se\u2014must\ncommit us to some sort of causal indeterminism. On the other hand,\nTurner (2011a) has tried to give an account of this second sense of\ncontingency that is neutral with respect to determinism. His\nsuggestion is that what Gould really cared about was random or\nunbiased macroevolutionary sorting. Processes such as coin tosses, or\nrandom genetic drift, can be random or unbiased (in a sense) without\nviolating causal determinism. One way to think about this is by\nadopting a frequentist conception of probability: the outcome of a\ncoin toss could be causally determined by small-scale physical\ninfluences, but the outcome is still random or unbiased in the sense\nthat over a long series of trials, the ratio of heads to tails will\napproximate 50:50. This account is closely allied with\nSepkoski\u2019s (2016) suggestion that Gould\u2019s metaphor of\nreplaying the tape of history was rooted in his work on simulations of\nmacroevolution in the 1970s. Turner (2015) has also argued that there\nis a connection between contingency, thus understood, and the notion\nof a passive evolutionary trend. \n\nMcConwell and Currie (2017) have added further complexity to the\ndiscussion by arguing that there is an important difference between\nabstract, source-independent accounts of contingency and\nsource-dependent accounts. The notion of sensitivity to\ninitial conditions is a good example of what they mean by a\nsource-independent account: it gives an abstract characterization of\nhistorical or biological processes without saying what the source of\ncontingency is. Does the source have something to do with genetic\ndrift? With mutational ordering? Or something else entirely? McConwell\nand Currie argue that in order to establish the autonomy of\nmacroevolutionary theory, a source-dependent account is required.\n\nSome commentators have noted that Gould\u2019s defense of\nevolutionary contingency sits in tension with his arguments, in the\n1970s and early 1980s, for a more \u201cnomothetic\u201d\npaleobiology (e.g., Raup & Gould 1974). A more nomothetic\npaleobiology would seem to place the emphasis on laws and\npredictability. However, contingency is thought by some to mean that\nthere are no distinctively biological laws (Beatty 1995). Haufe (2015)\naddresses this puzzle by arguing that Gould was interested in\ndeveloping a \u201cnomothetic\u201d science of macroevolution\ninvolving generations at large spatial and (especially) temporal\nscales, but that this is compatible with saying that contingency\nreigns at other scales. One other larger theme that may help to unify\nsome of Gould\u2019s thinking is his skepticism about the power of\nnatural selection, which is the classic example of a\nmicro-evolutionary process (see also Gould & Lewontin 1979). One\nway to limit the importance of natural selection is to insist on the\nautonomy of macroevolutionary theory, and to show that natural\nselection is insufficient to explain certain larger scale patterns.\nAnother way is to insist that evolutionary history is contingent,\nsince one would expect selection to produce convergent outcomes.\n\nThus, philosophers have done a lot of work on challenging conceptual\nquestions about the various senses of \u2018contingency\u2019 and\ntheir relationship to other macroevolutionary ideas. One problem\nlurking in the background of this discussion is empirical: how can\nscientists even tell whether evolutionary history is contingent or\n(say) convergent? Conway Morris (2003) assembles a whole catalog of\nexamples of evolutionary convergence in an effort to provide\ncounterevidence against Gould\u2019s contingency thesis. One\nimportant issue here is to find a principled way of distinguishing\ncases of convergent evolution (where unrelated lineages subject to\nsimilar selection pressures evolve similar traits) from parallel\nevolution (where lineages with similar traits to start with follow\nsimilar evolutionary trajectories) (Pearce 2012). Another issue is\nthat one can multiply convergences by giving coarser-grained\ndescriptions of the traits in question\u2014for example, by counting\nagriculture in humans and some ant species as the same trait (Sterelny\n2005). Powell & Mariscal (2015) argue that not all of the putative\nexamples of convergence really tell against the contingency thesis,\nand they try to specify more clearly what would actually count as\nevidence against contingency.\n\nIn developing his initial claim about evolutionary contingency, Gould\n(1989) made much of the Burgess Shale fauna, exquisite Cambrian\nfossils from western Canada first described by the American\npaleontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott in the early 1900s. Gould was\nwriting in the wake of what some call the \u201cfirst\nreclassification\u201d of the Burgess fossils, when work by British\npaleontologist Harry Blackmore Whittington and students Derek Briggs\nand Simon Conway Morris had placed many of the strange forms in their\nown phyla, with the idea that each phylum represented a unique body\nplan. Most of those Burgess phyla went extinct, but some (including a\nlikely ancestor of chordates) persisted. But what if that sorting had\nhappened differently? Since 1989, scientists Graham Budd, Allison\nDaley, and others using cladistic methods of classification (which\nwere slow to be adopted by paleontologists) have reclassified the\nBurgess fauna yet again, placing many of the strangest ones in stem\ngroups of existing clades (such as arthropods). So one further\nphilosophical question is whether and to what extent this change in\ntaxonomic practice matters to the argument that Gould tried to make\nabout contingency (Brysse 2008).\n\nThere is a closely related debate about the status of phyla. Some\ncladists see phyla as being nothing terribly special. Like any higher\ntaxa, phyla must be monophyletic, but from a cladistic perspective\nthere is nothing about the taxonomic rank of phylum that has any\nparticular importance to macroevolutionary theory. Others have argued\nthat lower ranks like order and class are evolutionarily meaningful in\na way that phyla are not (e.g., Holman 1989). Gould (1989), however,\ndrawing upon German paleontological tradition, saw phyla as\ncorresponding to stable morphological body plans (or\nBaupl\u00e4ne). This connects closely with his argument about\ncontingency: if different Cambrian phyla had persisted, downstream\nevolutionary history would have involved modification of totally\ndifferent body plans. Some scientists have recently tried to revive\nthe idea that there is something special about the role of phyla in\nmacroevolution (Levin, et al. 2016; though see Hejnol & Dunn\n2016).\n\nFinally, historical contingency is a counterfactual notion, and\nalthough this issue has not gotten as much attention as it deserves,\nthere is a nascent philosophical literature on historical\ncounterfactuals (Tucker 2004: 227ff; Nolan 2013; Radick 2016; Zhao\n2017 in Other Internet Resources). The debate about historical\ncontingency can be construed as a disagreement about the truth of\nvarious historical counterfactuals. Gould claimed that if things in\nthe Cambrian had been slightly different, there would be no\nvertebrates today, let alone humans, while other convergentists claim\nthat humanlike cognitive abilities, language, tool use, and sociality\nwould have evolved even if other things had been different in the\npast\u2014for example, if the non-avian dinosaurs had not gone\nextinct.\n",
