    "main_text": "Signaling\n17. Signaling\n\nWhen Kendall et al began organizing their IPD tournaments to mark the\n20th anniversary of the publication of Axelrod's influential book,\nthey received an innocent-seeming inquiry: could one entrant make\nmultiple submissions? If they did not immediately realize the\nsignificance of this question, they must surely have done so when a\ngroup from the Technical University of Graz attempted to enter more\nthan 10,000 individually named strategies to the first tournament.\nMost of these aspiring entries were disallowed. As it turned out,\nhowever, the winning strategy came from a group from the University of\nSouthhampton who themselves submitted over half of the 223 strategies\nthat were allowed. As the groups from Graz and Southhampton realized\n(and participants in Axelrod's earlier tournament apparently did not),\na good way to win a round-robin IPD is to accompany one's entrant with\nan army of \u201cenablers\u201d that boost its score relative to\nothers. In extreme form, the master strategy and its enablers begin by\nplaying a short code sequence of \\(\\bC\\) and \\(\\bD\\) moves by which\neach can be identified by either. Thereafter the enablers always\ncooperate against the master (allowing themselves to be exploited) and\ndefect against all others (thereby lowering scores of the master's\ncompetitors). The master defects against the enablers and plays a\nreasonable strategy (like TFT) against all others.\nUnder these circumstances the score of the master depends on only two\nfactors: the size of its enabling army, and the accuracy and cost of\nthe identifying code sequence. Accuracy is less than perfect if an\noutside strategy \u201caccidentally\u201d begins a game with the\ncode sequence. Cost is the payoff value lost by using early moves to\nsignal one's identity rather than to follow a more productive\nstrategy. Longer codes produce greater accuracy at greater cost.\nComing to a better appreciation of these ideas, Kendall et al\norganized additional tournaments in 2005, one restricting each author\nto a single entry and another restricting each author to a team of\ntwenty entries (though, as Slany and Klienrich observe, such\nrestrictions are difficult or impossible to enforce.)\n\nOne may well wonder whether this sort of signaling and team play has\nany importance beyond showing competitive scholars how to win\nround-robin IPD tournaments. In an evolutionary setting armies of\nenablers would rapidly head towards extinction, leaving a master\nstrategy to face its high-scoring competitors alone. There are, of\ncourse, examples among both animal species and human societies of\nsuccessful \u201cteams\u201d among which large numbers are exploited\nfor the benefit of few. Presumably, in these cases the exploiters\ntransfer enough to the exploited to ensure the latter's continued\navailability. Perhaps such payoff transfers within teams should be\npermitted in IPD tournaments intended to explore these issues. Even\nwithout such rule changes, however, there are less extreme forms of\nteam play that would perform better in an evolutionary setting. If one\nallows enablers to recognize and cooperate with one another, they will\ngain considerably with no loss to their master, except when an enabler\nwrongly identified an outsider as one of its kind. If one allowed them\nto play reasonable strategies against outsiders they would gain still\nmore, though the risk to their master (through outsiders' gain) would\nbe considerably greater. Even without allowing themselves to be\nexploited by a master, teams could benefit by playing \\(\\bC\\) among\nthemselves and \\(\\bD\\) with outsiders, or \\(\\bC\\) among themselves and\na reasonable strategy against outsiders. Slany and Kienreich (the Graz\ngroup) label these approaches EW, EP, DW, and DP and observe (among\nother properties) that for teams of equal and sufficiently large size\nthis order mirrors the order of the best-performing member of the team\nfrom best to worst. \n\nThe possibility of error raises special difficulties for team play\nwith signaling of this kind: an incorrect signal could be accidentally\nsent, or a correct signal could be misintepreted. Rogers et al (the\nSouthampton group) realized that the problem of sending and receiving\nsignals when error is possible is a well-studied problem in computer\nscience: reliable communication over a noisy channel. In both 2004 and\n2005 one of the IPD tournaments organized by Kendall et al introduced\nnoise to simulate the possibility of error. By employing some of the\nstandard error-correcting codes designed to deal with communication\nover a noisy channel as their signaling protocol, the Southampton\ngroup won both with a comfortable margin. \n\nIn IPD tournaments like those of Axelrod and Kendall et al, players\nknow nothing about each other except their moves in the game, and so\nthey can use no other information to signal their membership in a\ngroup. In the real world it would seem much more likely that other\navenues of communication would be available. The notion that\ncooperative outcomes might be facilitated by such communication among\nplayers is an old idea in game theory. Santos et al show how this\nmight be possible. Their work borrows from an influential paper by\nArthur Robson (1990). Imagine an evolutionary game, whose underlying\npayoff structure may be a stag hunt or a PD, in which all players can\nchoose only between (unconditioned) moves \\(\\bC\\) and \\(\\bD\\). If the\nunderlying game is a PD the population will stablize with universal\ndefection. (If it is stag hunt it might stabilize either with everyone\nplaying \\(\\bD\\) (the inferior equilibrium) or everyone playing \\(\\bC\\)\n(the superior equilibrium). To illustrate the beneficial possibilities\nof communication, let us suppose the former.) Now suppose a small\ngroup of mutants enter the population who make a signal (the\n\u201csecret handshake\u201d) and play \\(\\bC\\) against those who\nsignal and \\(\\bD\\) against all others. Since these players do as well\nas the originals against ousiders and better against themselves, they\nwill soon take over the population. (And this would not be true of the\nother possible mutants with similar resources, like those signaling\nand playing \\(\\bD\\) against themselves and \\(\\bC\\) against outsiders.)\nSo communications does seem to facilitate cooperation. If the\nunderlying game is a PD, however, once the new uniform cooperating\npopulation has taken over, it is itself vulnerable. It can be invaded\nand supplanted by a \u201cdeceiving\u201d) invader who signals and\ndefects against signallers. The resulting population can then be\ninfiltrated (but not supplanted) by other, non-signaling, defectors.\nSo Robson concluded that signaling could move a population from the\ninferior equilibrium to the superior one in an evolutionary stag hunt,\nbut could only delay the establishment of universal defection in a PD.\nSantos et al observe, however, that, if a second signal is available,\nthe universally defecting population could be supplanted by a small\ngroup of mutants using it as new secret handshake. Of course this\ngroup is itself vulnerable to mutants who mimic the second signal\nwhile defecting against all. In this case however, the resulting dark\nage may no longer be permanent. If a mutant group of signal-one\nhandshakers re-emerges before any signal-one defectors have drifted\ninto the population, they will again take over, and the cycle will be\nrepeated. (If a third signal were available, of course, the return of\ncooperation would be even easier.) The story is no longer one where\n\u201cevolution stops\u201d: rather the population cycles between\nstates of universal defection and universal cooperation. The time\nspent in each state depends on the payoffs of the PD and the number of\navailable signals. Santos et al demonstrate, however, that, for finite\npopulations with sufficiently slow mutation rates and large numbers of\navailable signals cooperation predominates in EPDs with signaling.\n\n",
