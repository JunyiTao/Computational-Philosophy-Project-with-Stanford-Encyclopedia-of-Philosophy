    "main_text": "\n\n\n\u201cRenaissance\u201d is used as a useful short label for the\nperiod ca. 1348 to ca. 1648. But the use of the term\n\u201cAristotelianism\u201d as applied to texts, contents and\ncontexts of that period is\n problematic.[1]  \n Some authors did indeed consider themselves as part of a\n\u201cperipatetic\u201d (i.e., Aristotelian) current or\n school,[2]  \n but it would be counterintuitive to limit the application of the term\n\u201cAristotelianism\u201d only to those authors of whom such\nstatements are known (since it probably would exclude most Renaissance\ncommentators on Aristotle). [3] \n On the other hand, if we use the term\n\u201cAristotelianism\u201d to denote everything in Renaissance\nphilosophy that with some high degree of probability makes direct or\nindirect use of Aristotle\u2019s texts: this would mean that\n\u201cAristotelianism in the Renaissance\u201d and \u201cPhilosophy\nin the Renaissance\u201d are equivalent terms (cf. Ke\u00dfler\n1990).\n\n\nHowever, there are texts in Renaissance philosophy that are obviously\nmore \u201cAristotelian\u201d than others, namely, the\ncommentaries on texts by Aristotle.  There are more of them\nthan we have from any other period of the history of philosophy. And\nin many of the Renaissance universities philosophy training\nwas keyed to the interpretation of texts by Aristotle and often\ninvolved the use of textbooks derived from works by Aristotle and his\ncommentators. In addition to this, the corpus Aristotelicum\nwas used as a matrix for textbooks and encyclopedias and as a\nstarting point for treatises on more or less special philosophical\n questions.[4] \n",
