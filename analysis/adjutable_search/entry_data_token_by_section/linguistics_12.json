The disputes are remarkable,\nif only for their fairly consistent venomous tone.\n\nAt their most extreme, many Emergentists and some Externalists cast\nthe debate in terms of whether linguistic intuitions should ever count\nas evidence for linguistic theorizing. And many Essentialists cast it\nin terms of whether anything but linguistic intuitions are ever really\nneeded to support linguistic theorizing.\n\nThe debate focuses on the Essentialists\u2019 notion of a mental\ngrammar, since linguistic intuitions are generally understood to be a\nconsequence of tacit knowledge of language. Emergentists who deny that\nspeakers have innate domain-specific grammars (competence,\nI-languages, or FLN) have raised a diverse range of objections to the\nuse of reports of intuitions as linguistic data. (But see Devitt 2006\nfor an understanding of linguistic intuitions that does not base them\non inferred tacit knowledge of competence grammars.) The following\npassages are representative Emergentist critiques of intuitions\n(elicited judgments):\n\n\nGenerative linguists typically respond to calls for evidence for the\nreality of their theoretical constructs by claiming that no evidence\nis needed over and above the theory\u2019s ability to account for\npatterns of grammaticality judgments elicited from native speakers.\nThis response is unsatisfactory on two accounts. First, such judgments\nare inherently unreliable because of their unavoidable meta-cognitive\novertones\u2026 Second, the outcome of a judgment (or the analysis\nof an elicited utterance) is invariably brought to bear on some\ndistinction between variants of the current generative theory, never\non its foundational assumptions. (Edelman and Christiansen 2003:\n60)\n\nThe data that are actually used toward this end in Generative Grammar\nanalyses are almost always disembodied sentences that analysts have\nmade up ad hoc, \u2026 rather than utterances produced by real\npeople in real discourse situations\u2026 In diametric opposition to\nthese methodological assumptions and choices, cognitive-functional\nlinguists take as their object of study all aspects of natural\nlanguage understanding and use\u2026 They (especially the more\nfunctionally oriented analysts) take as an important part of their\ndata not disembodied sentences derived from introspection, but rather\nutterances or other longer sequences from naturally occurring\ndiscourse. (Tomasello 1998: xiii)\n\n[T]he journals are full of papers containing highly questionable data,\nas readers can verify simply by perusing the examples in nearly any\nsyntax article about a familiar language. (Wasow and Arnold 2005:\n1484)\n\n\nIt is a common Emergentist objection that linguistic intuitions (taken\nto be reports of elicited judgments of the acceptability of\nexpressions not their grammaticality) are bad data points because not\nonly are they not usage data, i.e., they are metalinguistic, but also\nbecause they are judgments about linguist\u2019s invented example\nsentences. On neither count would they be clear and direct evidence of\nlanguage use and human communicative capacities\u2014the subject\nmatter of linguistics on the Emergentist view. A further objection is\nto their use by theorists to the exclusion of all other kinds of\nevidence. For example,\n\n[Formal linguistics] continues to insist that its method for gathering\ndata is not only appropriate, but is superior to others. Occasionally\na syntactician will acknowledge that no one type of data is\nprivileged, but the actual behavior of people in the field belies this\nconcession. Take a look at any recent article on formal syntax and see\nwhether anything other than the theorist\u2019s judgments constitute\nthe data on which the arguments are based. (Ferreira 2005: 372)\n\n\n\u201cFormal\u201d is Emergentist shorthand for referring to\ngenerative linguistics. And it should be noted that the practice by\nEssentialists of collapsing various kinds of acceptability judgments\nunder the single label \u2018intuitions\u2019 masks important\ndifferences. In principle there might be significant differences\nbetween the judgments of (i) linguists with a stake in what the\nevidence shows; (ii) linguists with experience in syntactic theory but\nno stake in the issue at hand; (iii) non-linguist native speakers who\nhave been tutored in how to provide the kinds of judgments the\nlinguist is interested in; and (iv) linguistically na\u00efve native\nspeakers.\n\nMany Emergentists object to all four kinds of reports of intuitions on\nthe grounds that they are not direct evidence language use. For\nexample, a common objection is based on the view that\n\n[T]he primary object of study is the language people actually produce\nand understand. Language in use is the best evidence we have for\ndetermining the nature and specific organization of linguistic\nsystems. Thus, an ideal usage-based analysis is one that emerges from\nobservation of such bodies of usage data, called corpora.\u2026\nBecause the linguistic system is so closely tied to usage, it follows\nthat theories of language should be grounded in an observation of data\nfrom actual uses of language. (Barlow and Kemmer 2002, Introduction)\n\n\nBut collections of linguists\u2019 reports of their own judgments are\nalso criticized by Emergentists as \u201carm-chair data\ncollection,\u201d or \u201cdata collection by introspection\u201d.\nAll parties tend to call this kind of data collection\n\u201cinformal\u201d\u2014though they all rely on either formally\nor informally elicited judgments to some degree.\n\nOn the other side, Essentialists tend to deny that usage data is\nadequate evidence by itself:\n\nMore than five decades of research in generative linguistics have\nshown that the standard generative methodology of hypothesis formation\nand empirical verification via judgment elicitation can lead to a\nveritable goldmine of linguistic discovery and explanation. In many\ncases it has yielded good, replicable results, ones that could not as\neasily have been obtained by using other data-gathering methods, such\nas corpus-based research\u2026[C]onsider the fact that parasitic gap\nconstructions\u2026are exceedingly rare in corpora\u2026. [T]hese\ndistributional phenomena would have been entirely impossible to\ndistill via any non-introspective, non-elicitation based data\ngathering method. Corpus data simply cannot yield such a detailed\npicture of what is licit and, more crucially, what is not licit for a\nparticular construction in a particular linguistic environment. (den\nDikken et al. 2007: 336)\n\n\nAnd Essentialists often seem to deny that they are guilty of what the\nEmergentist claims they are guilty of. For example, Chomsky appears to\nbe claiming that acceptability judgments are performance data, i.e.\nevidence of use:\n\nAcceptability is a concept that belongs to the study of performance,\nwhereas grammaticalness belongs to the study of competence\u2026\nLike acceptability, grammaticalness is, no doubt, a matter of\ndegree\u2026but the scales of grammaticalness and acceptability do\nnot coincide. Grammaticalness is only one of many factors that\ninteract to determine acceptability. (Chomsky 1965: 11)\n\n\nChomsky means to deny that acceptability judgments are direct evidence\nof linguistic competence. But it does not follow that\nelicited acceptability judgments are direct evidence of language\nuse.\n\nAnd as for the charge of \u201carm-chair\u201d collection methods,\nsome Essentialists claim to have shown that such methods are as good\nas more controlled experimental methods. For example, Sprouse and\nAlmeida report:\n\nWe formally tested all 469 data points from a popular generative\nsyntax textbook (Adger 2003) on 440 na\u00efve participants. Using\nthree different statistical analysis approaches (traditional\nstatistical tests, linear mixed-effects models, and Bayes factor\nanalysis), and adopting the assumption of critics that formal results\nare more \u2018true\u2019 than informal judgments, we estimated a\nmaximum replication failure rate of 2% for the 469 data points in\nAdger (2003)\u2026A replication rate of 98% suggests that the\nempirical foundation of generative syntactic theory is sound, at least\nfor the topics covered in Adger (2003). (p. 13 of Sprouse and Almeida,\nms 2010: see Other Internet Resources)\n\n\n(When they say \u201cformal results\u201d they apparently mean\n\u201cresults obtained by controlled experiments\u201d.) This can be\nread as either defending Essentialists\u2019 consulting of their own\nintuitions simpliciter, or their self-consultation of intuitions on\nuncontroversial textbook cases only. The former is much more\ncontroversial than the later.\n\nFinally, both parties of the debate engage in ad hominem attacks on\ntheir opponents. Here is one example of a classic ad hominem (tu\nquoque) attack on Emergentists in defense of constructed examples by\nEssentialists:\n\n[The charge made concerning \u201carmchair data collection\u201d]\nimplies that there is something intrinsic to generative grammar that\ninvites partisans of that framework to construct syntactic theories on\nthe evidence of a single person\u2019s judgments. Nothing could be\nfarther from the truth. The great bulk of publications in cognitive\nand functional linguistics follow the same practice. Of course,\nrhetorically many of the latter decry the use of\nlinguists\u2019 own intuitions as data. For example, in \u2026 an\nimportant collections [sic] of papers in cognitive-functional\nlinguistics, \u2026 only two contributors to the volume \u2026\npresent segments of natural discourse, neither filling even a page of\ntext. All of the other contributors employ examples constructed by the\nlinguists themselves. It is quite difficult to find any work\nin cognitive linguistics (and functional linguists are only slightly\nbetter) that uses multiple informants. It seems almost disingenuous\n\u2026 to fault generativists for what (for better or worse) is\nstandard practice in the field, regardless of theoretical allegiance.\n(Newmeyer 2007: 395)\n\n\nClearly, the mere fact that some Emergentists may in practice have\nmade use of invented examples in testing their theories does not tell\nagainst any cogent general objections they may have offered to such\npractice. What is needed is a decision on the methodological point,\nnot just a cry of \u201cYou did it too!\u201d.\n\nGiven the intolerance of each other\u2019s views, and the crosstalk\npresent in these debates, it is tempting to think that Emergentism and\nEssentialism are fundamentally incompatible on what counts as\nlinguistic data, since their differences are based on their different\nviews of the subject matter of linguistics, and what the phenomena and\ngoals of linguistic theorizing are. There is no doubt that the\nopposing sides think that their respective views are incompatible. But\nthis conclusion may well be too hasty. In what follows, we try to\npoint to a way that the dispute could be ameliorated, if not\nadjudicated.\n",
