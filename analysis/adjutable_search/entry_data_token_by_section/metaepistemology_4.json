This definition,\nthough common, is of course inaccurate. Epistemologists are\ninterested, for one thing, in epistemic justification, understanding,\nrationality, and their associated norms. For another,\nepistemologists\u2014especially those working in the tradition of\nresponsibilistvirtue epistemology (Zagzebski 1996,\n2020; Baehr 2006, 2011; Tanesini 2021; Battaly 2015, 2018; Cassam\n2019, 2020)\u2014are interested in the kinds of character traits\n(e.g., openmindedness, intellectual honesty, intellectual courage)\nthat put us in good positions to gain epistemically valuable goods\n(knowledge, justification, etc.) and which contribute to intellectual\nflourishing.\n\nIs epistemology about all of these things, and if so, is\nthere a way to characterize epistemology\u2019s subject matter that\nisn\u2019t too thin so as to apply to ethics and other areas?\n\nOne distinction within epistemology\u2014very broadly\nconstrued\u2014which offers a solution to this question is to\ndistinguish between two distinct but complementary \u201csides\u201d\nto epistemology: the side that concerns our evaluation of our\nconstitutive attempts to gain knowledge (viz., our beliefs\nand our judgments about whether something is so), and the side that\nconcerns our evaluation of which inquiries to take up, and how to\nsustain them given our limited resources, interests, and concerns.\nErnest Sosa (2021: Ch. 2; see also 2015: Ch. 2) refers to these two\nsides of epistemology, broadly construed, as gnoseology and\nintellectual ethics, respectively.\n\nTo get a sense of this distinction, consider how we might evaluate an\narcher\u2019s shot, aimed at a target. Even if this target\nwas a poor target to have initially chosen as the object of\none\u2019s archery attempt from a practical point of view\n(perhaps hitting it will have bad ethical consequences, perhaps the\ntarget is too easy to be worthwhile), such a fact would be irrelevant\nto whether we should evaluate the shot as accurate when it\nin fact hits the target as intended, and for that matter,\nwhether the shot is competent (i.e., if it issues from a\nskill to reliably enough hit the target in appropriate conditions), or\napt (i.e., if it is accurate because competent), or fully\napt (in that it aptness is attained aptly, and not just by\naccident or luck. In this respect, the success, competence, and\naptness of a shot, as well as its full aptness, can all be\nappreciated as \u201csealed off\u201d from many\nconsiderations\u2014which speak well or poorly of the\narcher\u2014that concern how the archer came to select that\nparticular shot, and how else she has conducted herself in doing so.\nSome of the wisdom of shot selection is itself gnoseological,\nas when it bears importantly on whether the risk of failure it too\nhigh, the assured reliability sufficient. After all, these will bear\non whether the shot will be not only apt but also fully apt,\nas not only its accuracy but also its aptness is aptly attained. Even\nso, we do care about wise rather than foolish shot selection\nin evaluating archery more holistically, where we import\nconsiderations that go beyond a focus on accuracy or aptness. We might\nadmire an archer for choosing well, from a practical point of\nview, what targets to attempt and which to forbear from attempting,\nand for her resilience in continuing to pursue a worthy aim, despite\nobstacles.\n\nOn Sosa\u2019s (2021) approach, what goes for the archer goes,\nmutatis mutandis, for the inquirer. Whereas our evaluation of\nthe inquirer\u2019s constitutive attempts at knowing (viz., her\nintellectual shots) are assessable as successful, competent, and\napt\u2014these are gnoseological or knowledge-related\nassessments\u2014our evaluations of how the inquirer conducts herself\nas an inquirer\u2014apart from her constitutive attempts at\nknowing\u2014also matter, but some of these are best\nunderstood as part of a different normative domain of epistemology:\nintellectual ethics. Here we should distinguish the\nconstitutive attempt to answer the pertinent question\nknowledgeably, and how that differs from the preliminary attempts to\neventually answer the question knowledgeably. Once one gives\none\u2019s answer in the constitutive attempt to answer\nknowledgeably, that is no longer inquiry. Inquiry has a distinctive\naim of its own, that of putting oneself in a position to\nconstitutively make one\u2019s attempt to answer knowledgeably.\nOnce one is ready to answer, once one considers oneself to be in a\nposition to make a proper such constitutive attempt, one ceases\ninquiring, and one then gives one\u2019s answer, even if it\nis an answer that one gives to oneself in foro interno.\n\nWhen you make a constitutive attempt to attain aptness on a question\nwhether p, and especially when you inquire in the endeavor to put\nyourself in a position to make such a constitutive attempt and to do\nso aptly, both what you do in so inquiring, and what you do in making\nyour constitutive attempt can be assessed either gnoseologically or in\nthe broader way of intellectual ethics where anything goes, anything\nthat bears on the desirability and appropriateness of such an attempt\nor such an endeavor. Gnoseological assessment can be of constitutive\nattempts to attain aptness or of endeavors to put oneself in a\nposition to (aptly) make one\u2019s constitutive attempt by actually\nanswering the question aptly. Either way, the assessment is telically\nconstrained by the gnoseological aims of attaining aptness of alethic\naffirmation, of correct (true) answer. Practical values are mostly\nirrelevant to such assessment, whether it is assessment of inquiry or\nassessment of constitutive attempts to answer a question\nknowledgeably. (But this is not to rule out that practical values\nmight still be relevant at a deep global level. For example, they may\nstill bear on the very norms and standards properly set by\nepistemic communities for when reliability is high enough to sustain\nlong-term belief storage, beyond the time when one can be expected to\nretain the operative reasons for the storing of that belief.)\n\nOn Sosa\u2019s view, drawing that distinction between gnoseology and\nintellectual ethics allows us to better appreciate the sense in which\npractical considerations bear importance in epistemology. While they\ndo not matter for gnoseological assessment as such (with the exception\nnoted), they are often important to intellectual ethics, viz., to the\nquestions that one actually bothers to answer, even to those that one\nbothers to answer in constitutive attempts to answer aptly, and of\ncourse practical values matter also to what inquiries one takes up,\nand how one budgets intellectual resources. However, the distinction\nhelps us to avoid conflating different kinds of intellectual\nnorms, while at the same time allowing these different kinds of norms\n(of gnoseology and intellectual ethics) to coexist within a wider\npicture of intellectual life.\n\nSosa\u2019s approach may be contrasted with three different kinds of\napproaches, due to Linda Zagzebski (1996, 2020), Christoph Kelp\n(2021a,b), and Jane Friedman (2020, forthcoming)\u2014as each hold\ndifferent views about how norms governing good (and bad) inquiry\nshould be conceived of, in connection with norms governing belief,\nunder the banner of epistemology. For Zagzebski, there can be no\nmeaningful distinction between gnoseology and intellectual ethics\nbecause our constitutive attempts at knowing are exercises of\nintellectual character virtues that, themselves, reflect our\nmotivations and values as inquirers. For example, for Zagzebski,\nknowledge just is gaining a true belief because of an intellectual\nvirtue, which she construes as a\n\n\ndeep and enduring acquired intellectual excellence consisting of an\nadmirable intellectual motive disposition and reliable success in\nreaching the truth because of the behavior to which that motive leads.\n(Zagzebski 2020: 103)\n\n\nThus, for Zagzebski, an evaluation of your attempt at knowing is\nat the same time is an evaluation of your intellectual\ncharacter and motivations; there is for Zagzebski no knowledge\ncompresent with bad intellectual motivations and thus with bad\ncharacter (though see Sosa 2017: 148 and Carter forthcoming: 2 for\ncriticisms in the case of perceptual knowledge).\n\nA different take on these two landscapes, which lines up more closely\nwith Sosa than with Zagzebski, is due to Christoph Kelp (2021a), who\nconstrues epistemology as the theory of inquiry. According to\nKelp, we should \u201ctake inquiry (or finding out about things) as\nthe starting point for epistemological theorizing\u201d (Kelp 2021a:\n2). Whereas Sosa takes constitutive attempts at knowing\u2014viz.,\nbelief and judgments\u2014to have have aims internal to them (with\ninquiry itself best understood a wider kind of activity within which\nwe make these attempts), Kelp takes inquiry itself to be a\nkind of activity with an aim, where the particular aim of a given\ninquiry depends on the type of inquiry it is. For Kelp,\nknowledge is the constitutive aim of inquiry into specific\nquestions (e.g., whether Frege ever met Russell) and understanding is\nthe constitutive aim of inquiry into general phenomena (e.g., the\nUK\u2019s exit from the European Union, the rise of the Roman Empire,\netc.). While Kelp doesn\u2019t attempt to analyze either knowledge or\nunderstanding reductively, he offers non-reductive\n\u201cnetwork\u201d analyses for both knowledge and understanding\nwhich are meant to elucidate the nature of knowledge and understanding\nin terms of their place in inquiry.\n\nA fourth kind of picture is developed in recent work by Jane Friedman\n(2020; forthcoming). Like Sosa, Friedman distinguishes\nbetween norms that govern believing and norms that govern ways of\ninquiring, the latter of which she terms \u201czetetic\u201d norms.\nHow are zetetic norms related to epistemic norms? Friedman\u2019s\nanswer is that they are often in stark tension with one another, and\nin ways epistemologists have often overlooked. As she puts it,\n\n\nThat some judgment or belief is, by our current measures, in\nimpeccable epistemic standing is not a good guide to whether\nit\u2019s an acceptable judgment to make in inquiry. (2020: 533)\n\n\nThe extent of the tension between these two kinds of norms, Friedman\nclaims, raises a kind of puzzle, given the presumably close connection\nbetween the epistemic and the zetetic, viz., between aimed believing\nand aimed inquiring. According to Friedman,\n\n\nI think following just those thoughts through calls for a revision to\nour standard epistemic norms, and perhaps even a significant one. The\nonly alternative seems to me to involve insisting on a fairly radical\nseparation of epistemology and a theory of inquiry. (2020: 533)\n\n",
