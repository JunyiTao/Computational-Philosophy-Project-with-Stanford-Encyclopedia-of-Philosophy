    "main_text": "The Inferential Conception || Inflating Inferentialism: Interpretation\n5.3 Inflating Inferentialism: Interpretation\n\nIn response to the difficulties with Inferentialism Contessa\nsubmits that \u201cit is not clear why we should adopt a deflationary\nattitude from the start\u201d (2007: 50) and provides a\n\u201cinterpretational account\u201d of scientific representation\nthat is inspired by Su\u00e1rez\u2019s account, but without being\ndeflationary. Contessa introduces the notion of an\ninterpretation of a model, in terms of its target system, as\na necessary and sufficient condition on epistemic representation (see\nalso Ducheyne 2012 for a related account):\n\nInterpretation: \u201cA [model \\(M\\)] is an epistemic\nrepresentation of a certain target [\\(T\\)] (for a certain user) if and\nonly if the user adopts an interpretation of the [\\(M\\)] in terms of\n[\\(T\\)].\u201d (Contessa 2007: 57; see also Contessa 2011:\n126\u2013127)\n\nThe leading idea of an interpretation is that the model user first\nidentifies sets of relevant objects in the model and the target, and\nthen pins down sets of properties and relations these objects\ninstantiate both in the model and the target. The user then (a) takes\n\\(M\\) to denote \\(T\\); (b) takes every identified object in the model\nto denote exactly one object in the target (and every relevant object\nin the target has to be so denoted); (c) takes every property and\nrelation in the model to denote a property or relation of the same\ntype in the target (and, again, and every property and relation in the\ntarget has to be so denoted). A formal rendering of these conditions\nis what Contessa calls an \u201canalytic interpretation\u201d (see\nhis 2007: 57\u201362 for details; he also includes an additional\ncondition pertaining to functions in the model and target, which we\nsuppress for brevity).\n\nInterpretation offers a neat answer to the ER-problem. The\naccount also explains the directionality of representation:\ninterpreting a model in terms of a target does not entail interpreting\na target in terms of a model. However, it has been noted that\nInterpretation has difficulty accounting for the possibility\nof misrepresentation, since it seems to require that the relevant\nobjects, properties, and relations actually exist in the target (Shech\n2015), although this objection turns on a very strict reading of\nContessa\u2019s account. This problem is solved in\nD\u00edez\u2019s (2020) \u201cEnsemble-Plus-Standing-For\u201d\naccount of representation, which is based on conditions that rule out\na mismatch concerning the number of objects in the collection.\nContessa does not comment on the applicability of mathematics but\nsince his account shares with the structuralist account an emphasis on\nrelations and one-to-one model-target correspondence, Contessa can\nappeal to the same account of the applicability of mathematics as the\nstructuralist. Like Su\u00e1rez, Contessa takes his account to be\nuniversal and apply to non-scientific representations such as\nportraits and maps. But it remains unclear how Interpretation\naddresses the Problem of Style. As we have seen earlier, in particular\nvisual representations fall into different categories and there is a\nquestion about how these can be classified within the interpretational\nframework. With respect to the Question of Ontology,\nInterpretation itself places few constraints on what\nscientific models are. All it requires is that they consist of\nobjects, properties, relations, and functions (but see Contessa (2010)\nfor further discussion of what he takes models to be, ontologically\nspeaking).\n",
