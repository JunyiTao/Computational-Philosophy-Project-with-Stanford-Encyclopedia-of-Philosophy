Is our fascination with and\nadmiration of elite sportspeople morally defensible? The debate about\nthe most valuable form of spectatorship has revolved around whether the\n\u2018purist\u2019 model of spectator is superior to the\n\u2018partisan\u2019 model. Purists derive aesthetic pleasure from\ngood play. They appreciate a virtuoso performance irrespective of the\nperformer, that is, irrespective of which team or athlete delivers it\n(Dixon, 2016). Purists have no allegiance to any particular team but\nappreciate feats of athletic excellence on their merits only. They\nappreciate good play, as one might appreciate a work of art without\nknowing or caring about the identity of the artist. For purists, a\nproper appreciation of the spectacle is paramount, and allegiance to a\nparticular team threatens to undermine a proper appreciation of\nsport. \n\n\nChief among the criticisms of purism (Russell, 2012; Feezell, 2013;\nMumford, 2011, 2012) is its neglect of partisanship. Partisans espouse\nthe virtue of supporting a particular team, even when that team plays\npoorly. Loyalty is paramount to partisans, and they follow their team\nthrough good times and bad.\nPartisans typically support their favoured team zealously, and they\ncheer for their team\u2019s success. For partisans, it matters that\ntheir team wins, even if they display less, or a lower form of,\nathletic excellence than the opposition.\n\n\nSome have argued that the admiration of individual sporting heroes,\ncharacteristic of purist spectators, is morally problematic. On this\nview, enthusiasm and awe surrounding the achievements of elite athletes\nare not morally respectable. Indeed, such attitudes reflect a\nfascistoid ideology (T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 1998, 2005). Admiration for\nwinners in sport involves the celebration of strength and, inevitably,\nthe expression of contempt for weakness. Strength is understood as a\ntrait for which one is not responsible but which has its origin in\ngenetics (T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 2005), so admiration for athletes based on\ntheir strength is thought fascistoid. On this view, in admiring the\nvictor(s), we cannot but demonstrate contempt for the loser(s):\nadmiration for the former and contempt for the latter are two sides of\nthe same coin.\n\n\nIt has been argued against T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6\u2019s account that it\nis descriptive rather than normative. At best, T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6\ndescribes how spectators do behave, not how they should behave.\nMoreover, admiration for the winner does not necessarily imply contempt\nfor the loser, and by extension, for the weak. Contra\nT\u00e4nnsj\u00f6, there is no necessary link between these two\nattitudes. Our admiration of elite athletes need not rest on an\nappreciation of their excellence understood solely in terms of strength\n(Tamburrini, 2000, ch. 5), as admiration for sports stars, properly\nunderstood, is only to a limited extent admiration of them because of\ntheir physical strength (Persson, 2005).\n",
