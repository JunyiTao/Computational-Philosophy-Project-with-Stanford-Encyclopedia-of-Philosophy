    "main_text": "Wolffian Rationalism\n4. Wolffian Rationalism\n\nPhilosophical rationalism can be understood to involve any or all of\nthe following: commitment to the existence of innate ideas or\nprinciples, the privileging of a priori cognition to\ncognition known a posteriori, and endorsement of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason (PSR). Even though Wolff is\nofficially agnostic regarding innate ideas, a priori\ncognition (at least in the traditional sense of a cognition from\ngrounds) enjoys a privileged place in his system, and to be sure,\nPSR is central to Wolff\u2019s entire exposition of\nmetaphysics and figures prominently in all levels of his philosophical\nsystem. Wolff is, accordingly, correctly identified as a philosophical\nrationalist; yet, this label has often inspired misleading\ncharacterizations of Wolff\u2019s thought as abjuring all reliance\nupon experience in the aim of constructing a pure intellectual system\nfounded solely on the principle of contradiction. Such a caricature,\nhowever persistent, is to be firmly rejected on both historical and\nphilosophical grounds.\n\nHistorically, this misrepresentation of Wolff as an arch-rationalist\nignores his liberal borrowings from, and deep engagement with,\nempiricistic and scientifically-minded thinkers, most notably Locke\nand Newton. In his capacity as reviewer for the Acta\neruditorum, Wolff was intimately familiar with intellectual\ndevelopments in England\u2014indeed he was brought on by Mencke\nspecifically in order to comment on the mathematical and scientific\ndevelopments there (for which task Wolff taught himself English over a\nSummer)\u2014and he wrote approving early reviews of Newton\u2019s\nOptics and Locke\u2019s Opera posthuma. In general,\nWolff took Locke\u2019s \u201chistorical, plain method\u201d as a\nmodel for his own empirical psychology, and admired the blending of\nreason and experiment that characterized Newton\u2019s method, even\nif Wolff was deeply skeptical of Newton\u2019s speculative and\nmetaphysical excursions in the Queries in the Latin edition of the\nOptics and in the General Scholium of the second edition of\nthe Principia (not to mention the metaphysical views\nexplicitly defended by Samuel Clarke in the correspondence with\nLeibniz, for the German edition of which Wolff wrote the preface).\nEven so, Wolff\u2019s importance for the reception of Locke in\nGermany is currently under-appreciated (vide Fischer 1975),\nand his contributions to the reception of Newton have only recently\nbeen explored in some detail (see Dunlop 2013, Stan 2012).\n\nIt might nonetheless be thought that Wolff\u2019s philosophy itself\ndoes not reflect this engagement with empiricism. Indeed, Wolff\nhimself gives this impression when he states in the German\nMetaphysics that experience is opposed to reason such that they\nconstitute \u201ctwo paths to truth\u201d (GM: \u00a7372), and while\nthe path of experience might suffice for the concerns of ordinary\nlife, Wolff makes clear that the philosopher cannot rest content with\nit but must use reason to press beyond what experience offers. That\nthis is so is reflected in Wolff\u2019s distinction between\n\u201ccommon knowledge or cognition [gemeine\nErk\u00e4ntniss]\u201d and \u201cthe cognition of a philosopher\n[Erk\u00e4nntniss eines Welt-Weisen]\u201d which he first\noffers in the German Logic:\n\n\nIt can now be seen how common cognition is distinguished from the\ncognition of a philosopher, namely, one who has no understanding of\nphilosophy can learn many things about what is possible from\nexperience, yet, he will not know how to indicate the reason why it\n[i.e., that which he learns from experience] can be. For instance, he\nlearns from experience that it can rain, but cannot say how it happens\n[\u2026] nor indicate the causes why it rains. (GL: Preface,\n\u00a76)\n\n\nThis would suggest, then, that for Wolff the path to genuinely\nphilosophical truth is ultimately that of reason pursued independently\nof experience.\n\nYet, a more careful look at Wolff\u2019s texts reveals that, rather\nthan representing completely divergent paths, reason and experience\nare envisioned as forming a complementary whole, where experience\nprovides an indispensable basis for properly philosophical cognition\nand even serves to confirm the latter\u2019s results. Indeed, the\nimportant dependence of philosophical cognition upon\nexperiential cognition is emphasized in Wolff\u2019s later discussion\nin the Preliminary Discourse. There, Wolff labels the\ncognition of that which is and which happens historical\ncognition (DP: \u00a73), and contends that cognition of the reason of\nthat which is or occurs, that is, philosophical cognition (DP:\n\u00a76), frequently relies on historical cognition as its foundation\n(fundamenta). This is the case, for instance, when we\ndiscover by means of experience something that can serve as the ground\nfor something else that is or occurs (DP: \u00a710). Since that which\nis known directly through experience is, for Wolff, \u201cfirm and\nunshakeable\u201d (DP: \u00a711), it follows that anyone who strives\nfor philosophical cognition should not neglect the historical, or as\nWolff claims, that \n\n\nhistorical cognition should precede philosophical cognition and be\nconstantly conjoined with it so that it does not lack a firm\nfoundation. (DP: \u00a711; cf. Kreimendahl 2007)\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, Wolff sets up his distinctive emphasis on experience\nand introduces his innovations in philosophical method in conscious\nopposition to his rationalist predecessors. He faults Descartes, for\ninstance, for attempting to posit universal metaphysical principles\n\u201cfrom which one will deduce through the mere understanding\neverything that is possible in nature\u201d (Wolff 1723\n[Preface]). Instead,\nWolff recommends near the end of the German Logic that the\nphilosopher should be trained \n\n\nto draw determinate propositions from experience and with the help of\nsome to find the ground of others, consequently, to unite reason with\nexperience (GL: c. 16, \u00a711) \n\n\nand later, in his oft-used metaphor, Wolff characterizes philosophical\ncognition itself as a \u201cmarriage of reason and experience\n[connubium rationis et experientiae]\u201d (LL: \u00a71232;\ncf. Cataldi Madonna 2001). Ideally, then, Wolff construes reason and\nexperience as converging toward a common end rather than constituting\ndivergent paths, and the philosopher is warned against pursuing one at\nthe expense of the other (DP: \u00a711). In this way, Wolff\u2019s\nrationalism clearly separates itself from the spirit of classical\nrationalism.\n",
