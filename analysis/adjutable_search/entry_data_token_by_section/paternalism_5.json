The group we are trying to\nprotect is the group of consumers not manufacturers (who may not be\nsmokers at all). Our reason for interfering with the manufacturer is\nthat he is causing harm to others. Nevertheless the basic\njustification is paternalist because the consumer consents (assuming\nthe relevant information is available to him) to the harm. It is not\nlike the case where we prevent manufacturers from polluting the air.\nIn pure paternalism the class being protected is identical with the\nclass being interfered with, e.g., preventing swimmers from swimming\nwhen lifeguards are not present. In the case of impure paternalism the\nclass of persons interfered with is larger than the class being\nprotected.\n",
