If Tibetan\nepistemology developed to a large extent in the framework of a\ncommentarial tradition, this did not prevent it from evolving into an\nautochthonous system with its specific terminology and formal features\nas well as addressing new topics that add to the themes inherited from\nthe Indian tradition. The present entry focuses on questions linked\nwith the theory of knowledge and the philosophy of language, but the\nscope of Tibetan epistemological works, like that of Indian\nepistemological treatises, extends also to the domain of logic and\nargumentation, metaphysics, religion, and ethics.\n\nThe currently available works (commentaries on the treatises of the\nIndian Buddhist forefathers and independent compositions), written in\nTibetan, range from the 11th c. to the present days. This\nabundant literature has for the most part not been studied outside the\nTibetan framework of monastic studies; the majority of works has never\nbeen edited, only a few are translated, mostly only partially. In\nparticular, material representative of the formative phase of Tibetan\nepistemology only became available in the last two decades.\n\nThis entry will merely scratch the surface of this rich tradition,\nwhich is by no means monolithic. Individual entries will hopefully be\ndevoted to the respective thinkers in the future. Although Tibetan\nepistemologists address common themes of inquiry and can in part be\nsituated within lineages sharing tendencies of interpretation, the\nindividual compositions reveal a diversity that would make any attempt\nat grouping them into rigid categories prone to oversimplification.\nThis article thus relies on the contributions of selected influential\nfigures to sketch out some key topics of inquiry and conflicting\nmodels representative of mainstream interpretative orientations.\n", "toc": [{"#Per": "1.

Periodization\n\nFollowing van der Kuijp (1989) one can periodize the Tibetan tradition\nof epistemology by relying on the one hand on the Indian sources taken\nas focus of interpretation by Tibetan scholars, on the other on the\ntype of scholarly activity involved (translation, composition of\ncommentary or of independent treatises). One can thus distinguish:\n\nThe ancient period. Corresponding to the time of the\nFirst Diffusion of Buddhism in Tibet (starting in the 7th c.), it is marked\nmainly by the translation of some Indian treatises on the subject.\nThis early interest in the topic might be connected to the invitation\nto Tibet of the Indian master \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, famous for\nhis integration of logico-epistemological tools in the discussion of\nMadhyamaka themes.\nThe pre-classical period. It starts with the Later\nDiffusion of Buddhism in Tibet in the late 10th c., a\nperiod which sees the translation (in some cases revision) of the\nsevenfold collection of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s works, and of a\nselection of commentaries, as well as of independent works by the\nauthors of these commentaries. Tibetan scholars devise new literary\ngenres to apprehend the contents of these works (notably,\n\u201cTopical outlines\u201d analyze Indian treatises according to a\nhierarchical structure, \u201cConcise guides\u201d offer an\norientation into the contents, explaining Indian treatises paragraph\nby paragraph), write commentaries, and also start composing\nindependent works. Typical of this period are the so-called Summaries\nof epistemology (tshad ma\u02bci bsdus pa). While these claim\nto present the essence of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s seven-fold\ncollection, they actually mainly (if not exclusively) rely on\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s Pram\u0101\u1e47avini\u015bcaya.\nApart from the commentarial works of the \u201cGreat\ntranslator\u201d and pioneer exegete Ngok Loden Sh\u00e9rap\n(rNgog Blo ldan shes rab, 1059\u20131109), Tibetan\nepistemological commentaries in this period are limited to the\nPram\u0101\u1e47avini\u015bcaya. This trend extends to the\n13th c., overlapping with the beginning of the classical\nperiod.\nThe classical period. Its start can be identified with\nthe crucial contribution of Sakya Pandita K\u00fcnga Gyeltsen (Sa\nskya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita Kun dga\u02bc rgyal mtshan,\n1182\u20131251) in his Treasure of Reasoning (Tshad ma rigs\ngter), composed in 1219. The focus shifts from\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s Pram\u0101\u1e47avini\u015bcaya to\nhis Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika, with the first\ncommentary on the latter being composed in the middle of the\n13th c., after Sakya Pandita had revised its Tibetan\ntranslation together with the Kashmirian scholar\n\u015a\u0101kya\u015br\u012bbhadra (1127\u20131225) around 1210.\nAnother characteristic of this period is that it sees the beginning of\na tradition of Tibetan commentaries on Tibetan epistemological works,\nstarting with commentaries on Sakya Pandita\u2019s Treasure of\nReasoning.\nThe post-classical period. Starting in the\n15th c., it is characterized by a reappraisal of ideas\ndeveloped in the pre-classical period, criticism of Sakya\nPandita\u2019s work and, respectively, defense of the latter. The\ncomposition of commentaries on Indian and Tibetan epistemological\nworks co-exists with that of independent treatises, including manuals\nknown as \u201cCollected topics\u201d (bsdus grwa), of\nwhich the oldest available instance is the Rwa stod bsdus\ngrwa composed by Jamyang Chokla \u00d6ser (\u02bcJam dbyangs\nmChog lha \u02bcod zer, 1429\u20131500).\n\n\nIn the pre-classical period, the lineage of epistemology initiated by\nNgok Loden Sh\u00e9rap at the Kadampa (bKa\u02bc gdams pa)\nmonastery of Sangpu (gSang phu Ne\u02bcu thog) played the\nleading role. Ngok Loden Sh\u00e9rap himself and influential figures\namong his successors\u2014notably Chapa Ch\u00f6kyi Sengg\u00e9\n(Phya pa Chos kyi seng ge, 1109\u20131169) and Tsang Nakpa\nTs\u00f6ndr\u00fc Sengg\u00e9 (gTsang nag pa brTson \u02bcgrus\nseng ge, ?\u2013after 1195)\u2014set interpretative milestones.\nThe \u201cNgok tradition\u201d (rngog lugs) of epistemology\nrepresented the mainline interpretative stream up to the\n13th century, when Sakya Pandita, advancing the need to\ntreat the Indian sources more faithfully and more exhaustively,\nembarked on a generalized critique of his Tibetan predecessors and\ncontemporaries, and initiated the \u201cSakya tradition\u201d\n(sa lugs). The rupture was not total, as Sakya\nPandita\u2019s epistemological system retained many features\ndeveloped in the Ngok tradition, but a dividing line was set on\nspecific issues. These remain points of dissent between authors whose\nlineage goes back to Sakya Pandita and authors belonging to the\nGandenpa (dGa\u02bc ldan pa) and subsequent Gelukpa (dGe\nlugs pa) traditions (both referred to as \u201cGelukpa\u201d\nhere for simplicity\u2019s sake). The former includes thinkers such\nas Gorampa S\u00f6nam Sengg\u00e9 (Go rams pa bSod nams seng\nge, 1429\u20131489) and Serdok Panchen \u015a\u0101kya Chokden\n(gSer mdog pa\u1e47 chen \u015a\u0101kya mchog ldan,\n1428\u20131508). Representative for the Gelukpa tradition are the\nworks of the disciples of Tsong Khapa Lobsang Drakpa (Tsong kha pa\nBlo bzang grags pa\n(1357\u20131419)\u2014Kh\u00e9drupj\u00e9 (mKhas grub rje\ndGe legs dpal bzang, 1385\u20131438), Gyeltsapj\u00e9\n(rGyal tshab rje Dar ma rin chen, 1364\u20131432),\nGed\u00fcndrup (dGe \u02bcdun grub, 1391\u20131474)\u2014as\nwell as the \u201cCollected topics\u201d manuals used in monastic\neducation. These prolonged, to some extent, ideas found in the Ngok\ntradition, although one should avoid hasty claims of continuity.\n2. Epistemology\n\nThe examination of \u201creliable cognition\u201d (tshad\nma) is the core subject of Buddhist epistemological works in\nIndia and Tibet. In the Tibetan tradition, it is subsumed under the\nbroader enterprise of classification of \u201cmind\u201d or\n\u201cmental episodes\u201d (Tib. blo) and involves the\ndetermination of the objects which the respective cognitions bear on.\nTibetan authors typically proceed by establishing various typologies\nof objects and of mental episodes and elucidating the various ways in\nwhich mental episodes are related to objects. Mental episodes are\nassociated with different operations and are categorized via\nprogressive subdivisions based on criteria that are also instrumental\nin defining reliable cognition. The characterization of the different\ntypes of objects, in particular within the typology of\n\u201capprehended objects\u201d (see 2.1.2, a), is tied with the\nadoption of a specific ontological and epistemological framework. \n\n2.1 Objects\n2.1.1 Ontological framework\na. The scope of reality\n\nTibetan epistemologists are primarily Buddhist thinkers who follow the\nMadhyamaka views. A pertinent question for them is whether reliable\ncognitions bear on objects pertaining to conventional reality and/or\nultimate reality.\n\nWhile some authors seek to include knowledge of the ultimate within\nthe scope of reliable cognitions, the view of the majority is that\nreliable cognitions concern the conventional realm. A further debate\nis about whether reliable cognitions should be limited to what, in the\nconventional realm, is held to be real. The definition of an\nontological position in epistemological works thus concerns\nconventional reality; the ultimate is beyond the reach of reasoning.\nWhat Indian Buddhist epistemologists categorized as\n\u201cultimate\u201d and \u201cconventional\u201d is transposed\ninto the Madhyamaka framework of the Two Truths under the categories\nof \u201ccorrect conventional\u201d (yang dag pa\u02bci kun\nrdzob) and \u201cincorrect conventional\u201d (log\npa\u02bci kun rdzob), with varying repartitions of objects\nbetween the two according to the ontological model that is adopted.\n\n\nTibetan authors define their position\u2014in some cases a\nprovisional one adopted as a mere interpretative tool for dealing with\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s texts\u2014on the basis of models associated\nwith Indian Buddhist schools. A fourfold typology of philosophical\ntenets is set forth along two lines of distinction. The first\nseparates external-realist positions from idealist\n(Vij\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101da)ones; the second separates\nrepresentationalist positions from non-representationalist ones.\nExternal-realist models agree in positing the existence of\nextra-mental entities, but differ in their account of the way that a\ncognition of such objects takes place. According to the\nnon-representationalists (commonly associated with the views of the\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika school), extra-mental entities exist\nsimultaneously to their cognition and are cognized directly by the\nlatter. According to the representationalists (associated with the\nSautr\u0101ntika school), extra-mental entities are the cause of their\ncognition but, being momentary, they have ceased to exist at the time\ncognition arises. \n\nEarly treatises attest to various choices among these models. For\ninstance, Chapa refutes the idealist and the Sautr\u0101ntika\nexternal-realist models and settles for a Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika-like\nposition, whereas Chumikpa Sengg\u00e9pel (Chu mig pa Seng ge\ndpal, 13th c.) opts for an idealist framework. Sakya\nPandita\u2019s position, shared by Gelukpa authors, is to arrange\nthese positions along a gradual ascending scale; the lowest, the\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika model is refuted in favor of the adoption of the\nSautr\u0101ntika model, which is itself replaced by an idealist one on\na higher scale of analysis.\nb. The extension of the real\n\nWhile real particulars (what Dharmak\u012brti calls\n\u201csvalak\u1e63a\u1e47a\u201d), characterized by their\ncapacity to bring about an effect, are allotted conventional existence\n(extra-mental or exclusively mental, according to the model adopted),\nTibetan scholars are divided as to the spatial and temporal extensions\nof such particulars.\n\nThe spatial options range from an infinitesimal particle (the atom\nbeing considered the smallest size unit) to a macroscopic object up to\na commonsense object; the temporal ones from a momentary entity to a\ncontinuum of indeterminate (although not infinite) duration. The\nadoption of extended objects is subject to the criticism brought\nforward by Dharmak\u012brti against Indian philosophers who admit\nwholes as distinct from their parts, and would, in a general way,\nconflict with the Buddhist idea that compounds only have nominal\nexistence. On the other hand, the infinitesimalist view has\ndifficulties to account for the fact that macroscopic objects appear\nto our cognition rather than individual atoms. The latter difficulty\nleads, in Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s works, to the refutation of\nextra-mental reality in favor of an idealist position. An intermediate\nview is to grant reality to objects that have some spatial extension:\nnot commonsense objects, but aggregations of atoms within the scope of\na specific sense-sphere (Skt. \u0101yatana, Tib. skye\nmched), such as, for the visual sense-sphere, patches of\ncolor.\n\nRegarding the temporal extension of real particulars, momentary\nentities pose a challenge to transactional usage: once known, they\nhave already ceased and hence cannot be used nor acted upon.\nTransactional usage is better grounded in objects that have some\nduration. Continua, however, bring about the same critique as\nmacroscopic objects: what really exists is a particular at each\nmoment, but the chain of causally related moments, even though it may\nappear to the ignorant mind as an object having duration, only exists\nnominally. A limited temporal extension is not an option, for, in\ndifference to aggregated atoms, the different moments in a series do\nnot co-exist\u2014only the present one exists and is causally\nefficient; they hence cannot be considered to contribute collectively\nto the cognition of an object.\n\nFew Tibetan authors, among them Taktsang Lotsawa Sh\u00e9rap Rinchen\n(sTag tshang Lo ts\u0101 ba Shes rab rin chen, b. 1405),\nadopt the infinitesimal-momentary view. The intermediate view is\nprescribed by Sakya Pandita and adopted, for instance, by Lowokenchen\nS\u00f6nam L\u00fcndrup (Glo bo mkhan chen bSod nams lhun\ngrub, 1456\u20131532), while Gelukpa authors and some Sakyapa\nones such as Ngawang Ch\u00f6drak (Ngag dbang chos grags,\n1572\u20131641) extend their view of reality to commonsense objects\nand continua, which are held to possess their own causal capacity.\nThey are described as collections, but distinguished from the partless\nwholes distinct from their parts advocated by the more extreme realist\nIndian philosophers who are the target of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s\ncriticism.\n2.1.2 Typologies\n\nObjects (Tib. yul) are primarily considered as cognitive\nobjects, in relation to cognitive episodes (Tib. blo). In the\ncommon vocabulary of Tibetan epistemology, several sorts of objects\nare distinguished:\n\nthe \u201cappearing object\u201d (snang yul)\nthe \u201capprehended object\u201d or \u201cgrasped\nobject\u201d (gzung yul)\nthe \u201cintentional object\u201d or \u201cconceived\nobject\u201d (zhen yul)\nthe \u201cengaged object\u201d or \u201cobject of\napplication\u201d (\u02bcjug yul)\n\n\nWhile the terminology, which reflects different kinds of mental\noperations, is shared among Tibetan epistemologists, they disagree as\nto the definition of each sort and as to the equivalence of some of\nthem, in particular of the appearing object and the apprehended\nobject.\na. The appearing and apprehended objects\n\nRegarding the appearing object and the apprehended object, a major\ncause of dissension lies in the model adopted to account for the\nprocess of a cognition of an object. Two options are in competition in\nthe external-realist model: (i) direct realism (associated with the\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika model) advocates a direct contact with reality;\nin this model the object and its cognition exist simultaneously,\nalbeit distinctly; (ii) a causal theory (associated with the\nSautr\u0101ntika model) according to which an object acts as a cause\nfor the emergence of its cognition but, being momentary, has ceased to\nexist once this cognition arises.\n\n(i) For an adherent of the first model such as Chapa, the appearing\nobject, the object that manifests itself in cognition, and the\napprehended object, what cognition apprehends, are one and the same\nthing (\u201cappearing object\u201d does not even figure as a\ndistinct category of cognitive object). \u201cAppearing\u201d\n(snang ba) is held to be a mental operation shared by all\ntypes of cognition. As such, each cognition is held to have its\napprehended object, and a threefold typology of awareness is\nestablished on the basis of three sorts of apprehended objects, which\nare exhaustive of what can appear in cognition:\n\nparticulars (mental or extra-mental)\nhallucinations/illusions (i.e., something that appears to a\nnon-conceptual cognition while being nonexistent)\nconcepts (don spyi)\n\n\nThese three are distinguished and paired with three sorts of mental\nepisodes by relying on two corresponding sets of criteria:\n\nThe characteristic of existence (associated with the notion of\ncausal efficacy) separates particulars (real entities) on the one hand\nand concepts and hallucinated objects on the other; it matches the\nidentification of the corresponding mental episodes as\n\u201cnon-erroneous\u201d and \u201cerroneous\u201d respectively.\nHere, the notion \u201cerroneous\u201d (\u02bckhrul pa)\nconveys a specific type of error, distinct from a mistaken\ndetermination (such as identifying a rope as a snake, or identifying\nsomething impermanent as permanent), an error which is simply due to\nthe object not being real.\n The characteristic of vividness, associated with that of\nspecificity, separates real entities and hallucinated objects from\nconcepts, and is the ground for the distinction between non-conceptual\nand conceptual mental episodes.\n\n\nThe correspondence plays out as follows:\n\n\n\nobject\ncognition \n\n\n(a)\n(b)\n(a)\n(b)\n \n\nparticular\nvividly appearing;\n\nspecific\ncausally efficient\nnon-conceptual\nnon-erroneous\nperception \n\nhallucinated\u00a0object\nvividly appearing;\n\nspecific\nnot causally efficient\nnon-conceptual\nerroneous\npseudo-perception,\n\ne.g., dream or hallucination \n\nconcept\nnot vividly appearing;\n\nnot specific\nnot causally efficient\nconceptual\nerroneous \nany conceptual cognition \n\n\nThe kind of awareness depends on the kind of object that it\napprehends. Mental episodes may be phenomenologically\nindistinguishable but still be of different types because their object\nis different. For instance, the perception of a fire (a non-conceptual\nnon-erroneous cognition) and the hallucination of a fire (a\nnon-conceptual erroneous cognition) are of different types, because\nthe object of the first is a particular and the object of the second\nis not. As such, Chapa can be said to endorse a form of experiential\nand phenomenal disjunctivism, and an externalist account of cognition.\n\n\n(ii) The premise that every cognition has its apprehended object does\nnot hold for an adherent of the causal model such as Sakya Pandita: a\nmental episode for the arising of which no real entity acted as a\ndirect cause must be held to have, strictly speaking, no object, or at\nleast, no \u201capprehended object\u201d (gzung yul). In\nother words, only non-conceptual non-erroneous cognitions (namely,\nperceptions) have a grasped object.\n\nThe causation-model further has the consequence that the apprehended\nobject cannot be identical with the appearing object: the apprehended\nobject has ceased at the time of the arising of its effect, a\ncognition in which an object manifests itself. Additionally, Sakya\nPandita understands \u201cappearance\u201d in the restricted sense\nof the mode of operation proper to non-conceptual cognitions. There\ncan be no \u201cappearance\u201d in the case of a conceptual\ncognition, for the latter does not apply to reality by way of an\nappearance reflecting real objects, but by way of exclusion, namely by\ndeterminations that consist in eliminations of the opposite. Thus,\naccording to Sakya Pandita, the distinction between non-conceptual and\nconceptual amounts to a difference in the mode of operation of the\nrespective cognitions, namely, via appearance (or vivid appearance)\nfor the first, via exclusion for the second, while the distinction\nbetween non-erroneous and erroneous relies on the existence of an\napprehended object, understood as a real object causing this\ncognition.\n\nAdherents of the direct realist model are thus criticized by those of\nthe causation model for admitting improper, non-existent apprehended\nobjects (namely, the concept and the hallucinated object), and for\nblurring the difference between the respective modes of operation of\nnon-conceptual and conceptual cognitions. In return, the causation\nmodel is criticized in that it does not enable direct access to real\nobjects; those can, at best, be inferred.\n\nAlthough later Gelukpa authors, who take causality and the time-gap\nproblem it involves seriously, adopt the causation model, they mostly\npreserve Chapa\u2019s typology, together with the identification of\napprehended object and appearing object. This leaves them in a\ndifficult situation as they adopt a typology of objects that precisely\navoids a model in which the object grasped by cognition would be\ndifferent from the object that appears to it. Their solution is to\ninvoke the notion of \u201caspect\u201d: a cognition caused by an\nobject takes a form similar to its cause. This aspectualism differs\nfrom a representationalist view in that it does not involve, strictly\nspeaking, a representation which would stand as a curtain between\ncognition and the object. Cognition still cognizes its object directly\nby taking its aspect.\nb. The intentional object\n\nWhile \u201cappearance\u201d is passive, the \u201cintentional\nobject\u201d is associated with an intentional operation of\ndetermination (zhen pa) that involves the (involuntary)\nblurring of the distinction between the mental appearance and an\nextra-mental particular by way of an unconscious error inherent to the\nthought process of ordinary beings. Such operation is restricted to\nconceptual cognitions, and is what allows action based on concepts,\ninsofar as via intentional determination the concept is conceived as\nhaving the nature of something external.\nc. The engaged object\n\nThe \u201cengaged object\u201d is usually identified with the object\nof reliable cognition, and hence understood differently according to\nthe definition of reliable cognition adopted by each author. In some\nversions, the \u201cengaged object\u201d stands out as a real,\nextra-mental particular considered to be the object that is likely to\nbe acted upon at the outcome of a reliable cognition (for instance, a\nfire when perceiving a fire or when inferring that there is a fire on\na mountain pass as one perceives smoke on a mountain pass). According\nto other authors, such as Chapa, the engaged object is the\n\u201cobject with regard to which opposite superimpositions have been\neliminated,\u201d without reference to any transactional\n\u201capplication.\u201d\n\nOne can identify, at the source of this typology of objects of\ncognition, the need to specify the scope of reliability for reliable\ncognitions, in view of problematic cases\u2014an issue already dealt\nwith by the Indian epistemologist Dharmottara. One such case is that\nof inference, which qualifies as a reliable cognition, but is strictly\nspeaking \u201cerroneous\u201d due to its conceptual nature. Namely,\nthe thought-content of an inferential cognition is a universal, which\nbears no correspondence whatsoever with extra-mental reality.\nDistinguishing between different types of objects allows making sense\nof this by considering inference to be erroneous with regard to its\napprehended object (for those that admit that it has one), or just\nerroneous qua conceptual cognition (for those who do not admit that it\nhas an apprehended object), but reliable with regard to its engaged\nobject, a real particular. \n2.2 Cognitions\n\nTypical of Tibetan epistemology is the classification of mental\nepisodes, which gives rise to the specialized literature of\n\u201cLorik\u201d (blo rigs), \u201ctypes of mental\nepisodes.\u201d The typologies adopted depend on the authors\u2019\nrespective views on objects, the model they adopt to account for their\ncognition, and how they define reliable cognition.\n\nThe threefold typology met with above, which distinguishes between\nconceptual and non-conceptual mental events, and among the latter\nbetween erroneous and non-erroneous ones, is generally accepted, but\nnot its correspondence with a threefold typology of apprehended\nobjects.\n\nMore fundamental in view of the focus of epistemological works is the\ndistinction between reliable and non-reliable cognitions. There is\nagreement as to which cognitions are reliable\ncognitions\u2014precisely those prescribed by Dharmak\u012brti,\nnamely, perception and inference\u2014although not as to what defines\nthem as reliable cognitions. As for non-reliable cognitions, one finds\nan opposition between a fivefold typology, which is the trademark of\nworks of the pre-classical period, and a more basic threefold typology\nprescribed by Sakya Pandita.\n2.2.1 Reliable cognition (tshad ma)\n\nFollowing Dharmak\u012brti, Tibetan epistemologists restrict the\nnumber of reliable cognitions to two sorts: perception and inference.\nThe first is defined as \u201cnon-erroneous and devoid of\nconceptualization,\u201d the second as the \u201cunderstanding\ncoming from a triply characterized logical reason.\u201d Both share\nthe status of being \u201creliable cognitions\u201d (tshad\nma), a status that Dharmak\u012brti associatedin his\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika with the characteristics of\nbeing (1) \u201cnon-belying\u201d and (2) \u201crevealing an\nunknown object.\u201d In addition to a prolongation of the\ncommentarial dispute on the verses in which these characteristics are\ngiven, a notable confrontation is found in the Tibetan tradition\nbetween two models that can be distinguished in view of the\nunderstanding of perception that they entail: (a) a model in which\nperception retains a passive status insofar as, being devoid of\nconceptualization, it cannot itself achieve a determination of its\nobject, and (b) a model that seeks to give a more active role to\nperception without however stepping back on its characterization as\n\u201cnon-conceptual.\u201d Two versions of the \u201cactive\nperception\u201d model are found: an \u201cindirectly active\nperception\u201d model and an innovative \u201cdirectly active\nperception\u201d model.\na. The \u201cpassive perception\u201d model\n\nThe \u201cpassive perception\u201d model can also be termed the\n\u201cclassic\u201d model in that it claims to offer a more literal\nreading of Dharmak\u012brti. This model, adopted for instance by Sakya\nPandita, takes \u201cnon-belying,\u201d combined with\n\u201cnovelty,\u201d as definiens of reliable cognition. Without\ngiving a pragmatic view of reliability, this model involves the\ncapacity to fulfill a goal, or to have some causal efficacy, as a\ncriterion for the non-belying character of cognition. Although being\nnon-belying and novel is sufficient to qualify as reliable, in a\ntransactional context, conventional reliable cognitions are expected\nto lead to an ascertainment (nges pa). While inference\nascertains its object by itself, perception is unable to do so,\nbecause ascertainment\u2014a conceptual operation, equivalent to the\nelimination of opposite superimpositions\u2014is incompatible with\nits being \u201cdevoid of conceptualization.\u201d Such an\nascertainment, should it occur (this requires a number of\ncircumstantial elements), must be performed by a conceptual cognition\nthat follows perception. In other words, perception is reliable in\nitself, but has to rely on a subsequent conceptual mental episode for\nascertainment. This \u201ctwo-tier\u201d way of accounting for both\nreliability and determination keeps a strict division as to the role\nand capacity of non-conceptual and conceptual cognitions, which Sakya\nPandita compares respectively by way of illustration to \u201ca\nseeing mute\u201d and \u201ca speaking blind.\u201d Should a\nsubsequent ascertainment not arise immediately (due to the nature of\nthe object, competence and mindfulness of the cognizer, visibility,\netc.), the preceding episode of perception still qualifies a a\nreliable cognition, but its reliability has to be ascertained\nextrinsically.\nb. The \u201cactive perception\u201d model\n\nSome interpreters, already in India, were dissatisfied with this\n\u201cpassive\u201d status of perception. Tibetan epistemologists in\nthe pre-classical period similarly argued in favor of a more active\nrole for perception for it to qualify as a reliable cognition.\nb1. The \u201cindirectly active perception\u201d model\n\nOne version of the \u201cactive perception\u201d model was upheld by\nNgok Loden Sh\u00e9rap, who included in his understanding of\nreliable cognition the requirement of a conceptual determination,\nwhile upholding the classical tenet that perception itself cannot\nconceptually determine its object. The model of reliable perception he\nproposes is thus indirectly active. It follows the two-tier way of\naccounting for determination in the \u201cpassive perception\u201d\nmodel, but sets determination as a necessary condition for\nreliability.\n\nAn important consequence of this move is that it implies a distinction\nbetween perceptual cognitions that are reliable in this sense and\nperceptual cognitions that are not. Perceptual episodes that are such\nthat no subsequent determining cognition immediately arises, which, in\nthe passive model, were considered reliable cognitions whose\nreliability nevertheless had to be ascertained extrinsically, fail\nhere to qualify as reliable cognition. A further consequence is that\nthis model leaves room for mental episodes that are both reliable and\nnon-reliable. For instance, the perception of an impermanent patch of\nblue, which is followed by the determination \u201cblue\u201d but\nnot by the determination \u201cimpermanent,\u201d is only partially\nreliable.\nb2. The \u201cdirectly active perception\u201d model\n\nThe \u201cdirectly active perception\u201d model, which was\npropounded by Chapa, brings revolutionary changes, first by\nintroducing in the definition of reliable cognition the notion of\n\u201celimination of opposite superimpositions,\u201d then by\nclaiming that perception itself (not a subsequent conceptual\ncognition) performs such a function.\n\nChapa formulates a new definition of reliable cognition in terms of\nthe \u201cunderstanding of a veridical object\u201d (don bden\nrtogs). The object considered here is the \u201cengaged\nobject,\u201d and its being veridical is explained as a\ncorrespondence to the status of reality supported by the absence of\nopposition. The long version of this definition brings to the fore\nelements that are systematized by later authors in a threefold\nlist:\n\nthe elimination of opposite superimpositions\nnovelty\nthe mode of apprehension\u2014to be reliable, a cognition must\ndepend on its object in a way that it does not occur when the object\nis absent.\n\n\nIn the later Gelukpa tradition, which draws on this model, the\ndefinition whose short version is formulated in terms of \u201cnewly\nnon-belying\u201d also includes the requirement of \u201celiminating\nsuperimpositions.\u201d\n\nIn the Dharmak\u012brtian system, the \u201celimination of\nsuperimpositions\u201d is tantamount to ascertainment (nges\npa). This is to be understood in the framework of the\n\u201capoha\u201d (lit. \u201cexclusion\u201d) theory:\nany positive determination proceeds via the elimination of what is\nother. For instance, determining a patch of colour as\n\u201cblue\u201d does not consist in identifying some blue property\nor some blueness shared by blue things, but in differentiating this\npatch from the \u201cother,\u201d namely from things that are\nnot-blue. Determination as \u201cblue\u201d amounts to eliminating\nactual superimpositions of \u201cnon-blue\u201d (for instance, if\none thought that the patch was yellow), or potential ones; in the\nformer case, the determination eliminates a mistaken judgment and\nreplaces it by a correct one, in the latter it prevents the subsequent\narising of a mistaken judgment. Both sides of the process,\nsuperimposition and its elimination, are, for Dharmak\u012brti,\nexclusively conceptual operations.\n\nThe adoption of the criteria of \u201celiminating\nsuperimpositions\u201d in the definition of reliable cognition does\nnot affect inference. According to Chapa, however, \u201celimination\nof superimpositions\u201d is not limited to conceptual cognition in\ngeneral. It has a broader scope than the kind of conceptual operation\nthat follows an intentional determination (zhen pa).\nPerception, although it does not perform any intentional\ndetermination, is indeed capable of eliminating superimpositions. It\ndoes so via a causal process: perception gives rise, at the next\nmoment, to another non-conceptual mental episode in which the\npotential of the wrong superimposition to arise has been neutralized,\nthus preventing its subsequent arising. By the third moment, there are\nno more superimpositions. Insofar as it, by this means, eliminates\nopposite superimpositions, perception is reliable and can be held to\nascertain (nges pa) its object, without involving any\nconceptual element. Whether a conceptual determination occurs\nsubsequently or not is irrelevant to the reliability of the preceding\nperceptual awareness.\n\nThe set of circumstances invoked in the passive model and the\nindirectly active model to explain the lack of a conceptual\ndetermination subsequent to a perceptual episode is now invoked to\nexplain why, although all aspects of the object appear, not all\nsuperimpositions opposite to these aspects are eliminated. In\nparticular, Chapa identifies as an objective condition preventing the\nelimination of superimpositions the case when a feature is\nnon-manifest (for instance, \u201cnon-blue\u201d can be eliminated,\nbut \u201cpermanent\u201d cannot be eliminated when perceiving an\nimpermanent patch of blue, because the feature blue is manifest, but\nimpermanence is not). \n\nA further specificity worth noting is that the \u201celimination of\nopposite superimpositions\u201d can bear on an object which is not\nthe appearing object. For instance, a perception which has a patch of\nblue as its appearing object can eliminate the superimposition\n\u201cnon-blue\u201d and thereby ascertain \u201cblue,\u201d but\nit can also eliminate the superimposition \u201cpresence of a patch\nof yellow\u201d and thereby ascertain \u201cabsence of a patch of\nyellow\u201d even though the absence of yellow does not appear to\nthis perception. The first process is termed \u201cdirect\nrealization\u201d (dngos rtogs), the second \u201cindirect\nrealization\u201d (shugs rtogs). A particular application of\nthe \u201cdirect/indirect realization\u201d model regards the\nrealization or ascertainment that can be achieved via reflexive\nawareness (rang rig). Reflexive awareness allows the\nascertainment of a range of features pertaining to the episode of\nawareness that is its apprehended object, and directly permits the\nindirect ascertainment of features pertaining to the object of that\nepisode of awareness.\n\nThe main criticism addressed by advocates of the \u201cpassive\u201d\nmodel to the \u201cdirectly active\u201d model is that it attributes\nto perception an operation that is restricted to conceptual\ncognitions; in their view indeed, \u201celimination of\nsuperimpositions\u201d amounts exclusively to the \u201cexclusion of\nwhat is other,\u201d the mode of operation of conceptual cognitions.\nProponents of the \u201cdirectly active\u201d model are not,\nhowever, guilty of attributing to perception a conceptual operation.\nIt is thus, rather, their new conception of \u201celimination of\nsuperimpositions\u201d that is at stake here, for which the more\ntraditionally oriented proponents of the \u201cpassive\u201d model\ndo not see a grounding in Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s system.\n\nAs hinted at in the last discussion, the fundamental disagreement\nbetween advocates of the respective models with regard to perception\nand more generally with regard to the definition of reliable cognition\nhas consequences for their understanding of non-reliable\ncognitions.\n2.2.2. Non-reliable cognitions\na. Fivefold typology\n\nBy embedding the discussion of reliable cognition within a general\nexamination of mental episodes, Tibetan epistemologists were led to\ndevelop a typology of non-reliable cognitions. A fivefold typology is\nshared by the majority of scholars in the pre-classical period and is\nmostly adopted in later Gelukpa textbooks. Thinkers who adopt it\nfrequently disagree, however, about the phrasing of the definition of\neach type and the specific cases they cover or not.\n\nNon-ascertaining perception (snang la ma nges pa). These\nare typically cases of non-conceptual cognitions that fail to\neliminate opposite superimpositions with regard to their appearing\nobject. This failure can result from a lack of attention, of wit, of\nfamiliarity, or can be due to the nature of an appearing aspect; the\nlatter might be non-manifest, or too \u201csubtle.\u201d Such\ncognitions do not qualify as reliable since an elimination of opposite\nsuperimpositions does not take place, but still qualify as perceptions\ninsofar as they are non-erroneous and devoid of conceptualization.\nAlternatively, they are defined in terms of their inability to bring\nabout a subsequent determining conceptual cognition.\nPost-knowledge cognition (bcad pa\u02bci yul can, or\nbcad shes). Such cognition, either conceptual or\nnon-conceptual, applies to an object with regard to which opposite\nsuperimpositions have already been eliminated. It thereby fails to\nfulfill the criterion of \u201cnovelty.\u201d\nFactive assessment (yid dpyod). Such a cognition\ncorrectly ascertains an object conceptually, but not via a proper\ninferential process. Although it is novel and eliminates opposite\nsuperimpositions, it does not qualify as reliable in view of its mode\nof apprehension. Indeed, factive assessment is held to entail truth,\nwhile still not depending on its object either via a relation of\ncausality or identity.\nMistaken cognition (log shes). A cognition can be\nmistaken from the point of view of its apprehended object or of its\nintentional object. In both cases, the error consists in not\napprehending\u2014respectively, not conceiving\u2014in concordance\nwith reality. Any cognition in which something that is not real, i.e.,\nnot causally efficient, appears is \u201cerroneous.\u201d This\nincludes perceptual errors such as hallucinations and dreams, as well\nas all conceptual cognitions since their apprehended object is a\nconcept, i.e., something that is merely superimposed. Determination\n(zhen pa) is in itself erroneous in that it confuses what is\nconceived and what is real. More restrictively, \u201cerroneous with\nregard to the intentional object\u201d indicates that a determination\nis faulty in that it does not relate to a state of affairs, for\ninstance, if one determines sound as permanent whereas it is in\nreality impermanent.\nDoubt (the tshom). Doubt occurs when one fails to choose\nbetween two alternative possibilities, leaving both options open.\nDoubt is usually considered a conceptual cognition. It may be held to\ninvolve an intentional operation of determination (zhen pa),\nbut does not bring about a conclusive ascertainment (nges\npa), either mistaken or non-mistaken. This case thus appears as\nthe conceptual pendent of non-ascertaining perception.\n\nb. Threefold typology and critique of the fivefold typology\n\nOpponents to the new definition of reliable cognition and the\n\u201cactive perception\u201d model, starting with Sakya Pandita,\ninstead adopted a threefold typology of non-reliable cognitions:\n\nNon-understanding (ma rtogs)\nMistaken understanding (log shes/log rtog)\nDoubt (the tshom).\n\n\nThese share as definiens the failure of being\n\u201cnon-belying\u201d and can be ultimately reduced to the unique\ncategory of non-understanding.\n\nThe critique of the fivefold typology of non-reliable cognition\ntargets in particular the categories of non-ascertaining perception,\npost-knowledge cognition, and factive assessment. \n\nSakya Pandita argues from the perspective of the \u201cpassive\nperception\u201d model, relying on the understanding of perception as\na passive cognition which does not itself ascertain its object, but\nwhose reliability is actually independent of this subsequent\nascertainment. The category of \u201cnon-ascertaining\ncognition\u201d is thus denied the status of independent category:\naccording to proponents of the \u201cpassive perception\u201d model,\nevery perception is a non-ascertaining perception; ascertainment (when\nit takes place) is always the deed of a subsequent conceptual\ncognition. There is thus no such thing as an \u201cascertaining\nperception\u201d if what is implied is ascertainment by perception\nitself.\n\nPost-knowledge cognition is also rejected as a distinct category.\nNon-conceptual post-knowledge cognition is in particular held to be\nimpossible. Indeed, any subsequent perception necessarily has a new\nobject since the object of the previous perception, being a momentary\nparticular, has already ceased to exist when the subsequent perception\narises. More generally, a post-knowledge cognition would have no\ncognitive role, for its object would not be something that is to be\nunderstood; it is accordingly judged to amount to\nnon-understanding.\n\nCases of factive assessment are subsumed under the category of doubt.\nDoubt should not be understood here in the sense of\n\u201chesitation,\u201d between two options but as the lack of\ndecisive ascertainment. Indeed, that an episode of factive assessment\nis actually correct\u2014which can only be ascertained\nextrinsically\u2014does not amount to its constituting a decisive\nascertainment. If no evidence at all is adduced, such \u201clucky\nguesses\u201d are not worth any certitude, and if faulty evidence is\nadduced, they are to be interpreted as pseudo-inferences.\n2.3 Universals\n\nAn important issue at the crossing of ontology and epistemology that\nalso has consequences for the philosophy of language is that of\nuniversals. Two main trends can be distinguished among Tibetan\nauthors: The first, which is termed below \u201cantirealism,\u201d\nis a literal interpretation of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s thought\ndenying reality to universals and properties. The second, which one\ncan describe as \u201cmoderate realism,\u201d holds that not all\nuniversals are non-existent. In particular, it concedes some reality\nto predicates, thereby granting reality to the universals that are\ntheir referents.\n2.3.1 Antirealism\n\nThe antirealist position, held by Sakya Pandita and his epigones,\ninsists on the radical distinction between the conceptual domain and\nreality, between universals and particulars. Only particulars are\nreal\u2014the criterion for reality being causal efficiency.\nUniversals are mere mental constructions; they are superimpositions\nthat do not reflect reality, but veil the individuality of particulars\nunder the cover of an imagined shared property. Conversely, the\ndistinct properties that one ascribes to a particular are equally not\npart of the fabric of reality, but mental constructions that veil the\nunity of that particular.\n\nThe question of the why and the how of concept formation is dealt with\nwithin the framework of the theory of any\u0101poha\n(\u201cexclusion of the other,\u201d Tib. gzhan sel)\npropounded by Dharmak\u012brti. According to Dharmak\u012brti,\nconceptual thought proceeds by applying distinctions among particulars\nin a way that reflects some subjective intention and beginningless\nhabits acquired in countless past lives. One accordingly ends up\ngrouping things by excluding them from other things. What is implied\nby the term \u201cexclusion\u201d is that what particulars\napprehended under the cover of a universal have in common is merely\nthat they are all excluded from a complementary domain. In short, what\nxs have in the common is that they are not non-xs.\nBy subsuming a particular under an imagined universal, or by ascribing\na property to it, mentally or verbally, one is not identifying a real\nfeature of this object, but merely distinguishing it from other\nparticulars.\n\nAlthough universals and properties are conceptual constructions, we\nmistakenly identify them as something real. This mistaken conflation\nof the conceptual and reality that we spontaneously apply when forming\nor using concepts provides a bridge between the two domains, prompting\npractical action, interaction with reality, based on fictions. The\nsuccess of such interaction is accounted for by the causation involved\nin the process of concept formation which guarantees an indirect link\nbetween universals and the particulars they are taken to stand for:\nconcepts are formed as the result of experiences involving causally\nactive particulars; however, only the individual causal capacities of\nparticulars are involved, not any shared potential that would\ndetermine natural kinds. Thus, for instance, the universal\n\u201cfire\u201d is conceived following experiences of particulars\nthat one excludes from other particulars that are held not to burn. By\nacting on the basis of the inference that there is \u201cfire\u201d\non a mountain pass when one perceives smoke in this locus, although\nthe object of this inference is the universal \u201cfire,\u201d not\na real fire, when one acts on the basis of this inference one obtains\na particular that fulfills the expected function of burning, as the\npreviously experienced particulars that one excluded from non-fire\ndid.\n2.3.2 Moderate realism\n\nThe Gelukpa tradition as well as some Sakyapa thinkers instead adopted\na moderate realist position with regard to universals. Their argument\nis that if universals were not real, reasoning based on universals\nwould not apply to reality. In other words, reasoning cannot lead to\npractical success by relying on mere fictions. Moderate realism thus\npresents itself as an attempt to account for the soundness of\nconceptual cognitions, and to do so in a way that is more intuitive\nthan the antirealist model.\n\nIn Gelukpa textbooks, universals and specific instances are defined in\nterms of each other: a universal is something instantiated by its\ninstances, the instances are what is subsumed by a kind, or universal.\nTo qualify as an instance, three criteria must be satisfied, namely,\nx is a specific instance of y if\n\nx is y\nx has a relation of essential identity with y\nthere are other instances of y different from\nx.\n\n\nThere is thus no intrinsic difference between particular and\nuniversal, those are relative notions. For instance, \u201cpen\u201d\nis a universal with regard to \u201cred pen,\u201d which is its\nparticular (a red pen is a pen, and is essentially identical with pen,\nand there are other instances of pen, such as a blue pen, that are not\na red pen). But \u201cpen\u201d is also a particular with regard to\n\u201cimpermanence,\u201d and \u201cred pen\u201d is a universal\nwith regard to \u201cplastic red pen.\u201d\n\nFurther, the instantiation of a universal by its specific instance is\ntaken to be a relation that obtains in reality, rather than amounting\nto a constructed superimposition. The red pen really is a pen; it is\nnot merely apprehended under the superimposed universal\n\u201cpen\u201d due to its being excluded from non-pen.\n\nThe relation between the instance and the universal is expressed by\nthe formula \u201cone nature and distinct exclusions\u201d (or\n\u201cdistinct distinguishers for one nature,\u201d Tib. ngo bo\ngcig la ldog pa tha dad). The term \u201cexclusion\u201d brings\nus back to the theory of apoha. When proponents of\nantirealism use this formula, they mean that various conceptual\ndistinctions can be made with regard to a unique particular, by\ndistinguishing it from various complementary domains; for instance,\none can conceive of a particular as excluded from non-blue, from\nnon-impermanent, from non-material, etc. For the moderate realist,\nhowever, this distinction is not a mere conceptual one, it extends to\nreality, although it does not entail a distinction pertaining to the\nsubstance. There are thus real properties that can be predicated, but\nthey are not intrinsically distinct from their subject. If one accepts\nreal predicates, then the universals that are the referents of the\ncorresponding expressions must also be accepted.\n\nBoth the antirealist and the moderate realist models attempt to bridge\nthe gap between universals and particulars by grounding universals in\nreality, the antirealist one by involving causality in the process of\nconcept formation, the moderate realist one by implying a\ncorrespondence in reality to our conceptual distinctions. The second\nmodel, although it provides a more intuitively acceptable explanation,\nmeets with difficulties. If taking conceptual divisions as actual\ndivisions is not without tensions, the mere fact of positing real\nuniversals is problematic in the commentarial tradition of an\nantirealist forefather. A key move in this regard is to distinguish\nthe idea of a universal qua mental construct, and a universal qua a\nphenomena common to several instances. In the second sense, a\nuniversal needs not be unreal.\n\nOther models of moderate realism were developed in the Sakyapa\ntradition, that also invoke the necessity for the existence of a real\nshared property without which our thinking would be arbitrary. Uyukpa\nRikp\u00e9 Sengg\u00e9 (\u02bcU yug pa Rigs pa\u02bci seng\nge, 13th c.), who adopts such a line of\ninterpretation, explains Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s refutation of real\nuniversals as referring to a \u201cmental universal,\u201d the\nmistaken conflation of distinct things under a unitary appearance. His\nview of an \u201cobjective universal\u201d involves the theory of\napoha, in a way that takes the exclusion from non-x as a fact\nrather than as a mental construct.\n\nAnother Sakyapa author who adopts moderate realism is Podong\nChokl\u00e9 Namgyel (Bo dong Phyogs las rnam rgyal,\n1376\u20131451). He qualifies as a realist insofar as he\ndistinguishes between universal qua construct and universal qua common\nphenomena, and accuses the antirealists of nihilism. He nonetheless\ncriticizes other Tibetan versions of moderate realism, which he\nconsiders to be prone to Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s critique against\nreal universals. His solution, akin to Uyukpa\u2019s, is to\nreformulate the universal negatively as a real elimination; a solution\nwhich, however, does not escape the faults he himself addressed\nagainst the positive version of real universals.\n\nModerate realism is traditionally ascribed to Chapa and scholars of\nthe Sangpu school in general. However, the earliest occurrence of\nexplicit arguments in favor of real universals identified so far is in\nthe works of Chumikpa in the last phase of the pre-classical period\nthat already overlaps with the classical one.\n3. Philosophy of language\n3.1 The object of words\n\nLanguage is dealt with in Tibetan epistemological treatises in terms\nof the relationship between \u201cwhat expresses\u201d (rjod\nbyed) and \u201cwhat is expressed\u201d (brjod\nbya)\u2014two notions that come quite close to the Saussurian\ndistinction between \u201csignifier\u201d and\n\u201csignified.\u201d\n\nAccording to the basic presuppositions of Buddhist ontology,\n\u201cwords\u201d consist in singular sound emissions uttered at a\nspecific place and time, and the \u201cobjects\u201d that are\ninteracted with as a consequence of language use are momentary and\nunique particulars. Although words and objects appear to be what\nexpresses and what is expressed, the success of language cannot rely\non a relation between particular words and particular objects, for\nthis would not provide the generalizability necessary for language to\nhave any practical utility. Particular words express particular\nobjects only in virtue of the conventional relation established,\nwithin a linguistic community, between generic words and meanings.\n\nAccordingly, Tibetan models distinguish between (i) a \u201cdirect\nsignifier\u201d and a \u201cdirectly signified\u201d\u2014a\ngeneric word (sgra spyi) and a generic object, identified as\na \u201cdon spyi\u201d (the term was previously translated\nas \u201cconcept\u201d when discussing the apprehended object of\nconceptual cognition)\u2014and (ii) a \u201cconceived\nsignifier\u201d and a \u201cconceived signified,\u201d the\nparticular sound emission and the particular object.\n\n\n(i)\n direct signifier\n\n(dngos kyi rjod byed = sgra spyi)\ndirectly signified\n\n(dngos kyi brjod bya = don spyi/sgra don) \n\n(ii)\nconceived signifier\n\n(zhen pa\u02bci rjod byed = sgra [rang gi mtshan nyid])\nconceived signified\n\n(zhen pa\u02bci brjod bya = don [rang gi mtshan nyid])\n\n\n\nThere are two main issues with this model, one is the relation between\nthe direct signifier and signified and the conceived ones, the other\nis the understanding of what is the \u201cdirectly\nsignified.\u201d\n\n(a) The question of establishing relations between generic words and\nmeaning whereas there exist, in reality, only particular sound\nutterances and objects, and the question of interaction with these\nparticulars relying on generic words and meanings echo the issue\nalready met with in the context of conceptual processes and actions\nrelying on them, namely, bridging the gap between the conceptual realm\nand reality. The expression \u201cconceived\u201d (zhen pa)\nis here also indicative of a process of intentional determination that\ninvolves the mistaken identification of the conceptual fiction with\nextra-mental reality. Sakya Pandita distinguishes the context of\n\u201cexplanation,\u201d where one differentiates between\n\u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cconceived\u201d signifier and\nsignified, between generic and specific words and objects, and the\ncontext of \u201caction,\u201d that is, practical language use. In\nthe context of \u201caction\u201d\u2014this includes\nconvention-setting and application of conventions\u2014these\ndifferences are blurred for speakers and hearers. The double\narticulation of the conceptual and reality thus holds together thanks\nto spontaneous mistaken identifications that take place while learning\nand applying linguistic conventions.\n\nThe divergences discussed in the section on universals between\nantirealists and moderate realists are reflected when it comes to\nlanguage: while antirealists hold that language, just like conceptual\nthought, merely deals with fictions, moderate realists argue that\nlanguage captures real features of the world, even if only in a\ndistorted fashion. They thereby admit real properties shared by\ndiscrete instances. These properties are (due to commentarial\nrequirements) presented in negative terms, as \u201cobjective\nexclusions.\u201d For later Gelukpa authors, the \u201cnot being\nnon-x\u201d (some authors do not bother with the double negation)\nshared by several instances is the main object of the convention,\nwhile the corresponding concept, the don spyi, is its\nsecondary object.\n\nFor a justification of the success of language, antirealists can\nappeal to the theory of apoha and the explanation involving\ncausality in concept formation. Indeed, words reflect conceptual\ndistinctions that can also be understood as constructed universals;\nlanguage can only occur within a system of concepts. In\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s system, which is here presupposed, words are\nassociated via conventions not with an object, but with a\n\u201cdistinction\u201d which requires a bipartition of particulars\nin two complementary domains. A word can be associated to this\ndistinction of xs from non-xs at the time of an\nagreement. Subsequently, any use of an utterance that is a token of\nthis word indicates nothing else than the elimination of\nnon-xs, but can lead to obtain a particular excluded from\nnon-xs. The causal process involved in the process of concept\nformation is what ensures success, provided that conventions are\nestablished and learned successfully.\n\n(b) The identification of the \u201cdirectly signified\u201d prompts\ndivergences among Tibetan scholars.\n\nFor authors who accept that conceptual cognition has an apprehended\nobject, this object (the concept [don spyi]) is also what is\ndirectly signified by a word. A word utterance triggers the emergence\nof such an appearing object in the mind of the hearer. The distinction\nbetween \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cconceived\u201d signified\nsupports a distinction between sense and reference. Distinct words\ntrigger the emergence of distinct \u201cgeneric\nobjects\u201d\u2014there are distinct \u201cdirectly\nsignified.\u201d The corresponding \u201cconceived signified\u201d\ncan be distinct as well (for instance for the emergence of the generic\nobjects \u201cpot\u201d and \u201cpillar\u201d) or the same (for\ninstance a particular blue pot is the conceived signified for both the\ngeneric objects \u201cpot\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d). Some\nauthors of the pre-classical period contend that some distinct\nwords\u2014true synonyms\u2014generate the apparition of the same\ngeneric object, thus parting with the ultra-intensionality that reigns\nin Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s system, where each word is ascribed a\nunique way of excluding something from what it is not.\n\nNote that the generic object is not unanimously accepted as the\nsignified even among authors that admit that it is the apprehended\nobject of conceptual awareness. Chumikpa for instance prescribes as\nsignified \u201ca generic object mixed with a generic word.\u201d\nAccordingly, what appears in conceptual cognition upon hearing a\nparticular word is a mixed aspect of the corresponding generic word\nand generic object. The extra-mental entity is obtained via an\noperation of determination pertaining to the generic object, which is\nthe apprehended object of conceptual awareness.\n\nThat conceptual cognitions have an apprehended object is not admitted\nby all Tibetan scholars, and, as seen above, is criticized in\nparticular by Sakya Pandita. The latter nevertheless adopts the same\nbasic linguistic model as his predecessors, using for the\n\u201cdirectly signified\u201d the more Dharmak\u012brtian\nexpression \u201cverbal object\u201d (Tib. sgra don, Skt.\n\u015babd\u0101rtha) alternatively to the expressions\n\u201cgeneric object\u201d (don spyi). However, the point\nof contention discussed in the context of the threefold typology of\nobjects re-emerges, as this author insists that such a signifier\nactually does not exist (it is not a causally efficient particular)\nand is not even properly speaking an \u201cobject.\u201d Still Sakya\nPandita adopts, phenomenologically speaking, a view that is quite\nsimilar to the one he criticizes: while his opponents speak of a\n\u201cgeneric object appearing to conceptual awareness,\u201d Sakya\nPandita accepts that there is the emergence of an \u201cimage\u201d\nor \u201creflection\u201d (Tib. gzugs brnyan, Skt.\npratibimba/pratibh\u0101) in conceptual thought. But\nas far as meaning is concerned, Sakya Pandita holds the more radical\nview that words actually do not signify anything: a word does not have\nany object, because nothing qualifies as such. One can speak, but only\nmetaphorically, of the extra-mental particular as being\n\u201csignified\u201d insofar as it is what one obtains when acting\nupon the determination in which generic and specific, conceptual and\nreal, are confused. This extra-mental particular alone can provide the\nbasis for intersubjective agreement about the object of words. The\ngeneric object could not play this role: being private, it would in\nany case not be able to play any epistemic role.\n\nThis model is constructed as a way to bridge the gap between\nconceptual processes and reality, and, consequently, focuses on\nlanguage use in transactional usage involving real entities. If the\nuse of words expressing non-entities can be accounted for, it however\nturns out to be problematic, in a model where meaning is only acquired\nindirectly through a mistaken process of conflating a conceptual\nfiction and reality, to talk about abstract entities, such as first-\nor second-order properties. For instance, the word \u201cred\u201d\ncould only acquire a meaning in the sense of a red particular, i.e.,\nas \u201csomething red,\u201d but not as the \u201cproperty\nred.\u201d As a consequence, heterological predicates are ruled out,\nfor both the word for the subject and the word for the property are\nrelated to the same particular in the process of mistaken\nidentification with an extra-mental entity. For instance, expressing\nthe idea that \u201c(the particular) sound is audible but (the\nproperty) audible is not audible\u201d would be problematic if\n\u201caudible\u201d only means \u201cwhat is audible.\u201d In\ncontrast, advocates of concepts being the apprehended object of\nconceptual cognition can account for metalinguistic discussions by\nkeeping open the possibility that, via the operation of intentional\ndetermination, the concept is conceived as a concept (and not\nsystematically as an extra-mental particular).\n3.2 The theory of definition\n\nA significant contribution of Tibetan epistemology which can be\nincluded within the philosophy of language is the discussion of\ndefinition and the related issue of predication. The specificity of\nthe Tibetan theory of definition is that it takes into account not two\nelements\u2014a definiens and a definiendum\u2014but three\nelements\u2014the definiens, the definiendum, and the definitional\nbasis\u2014along a model which bears many similarities with that of\ninference. \u201cDefining\u201d thus relies on the relation between\nthe definiens and the definiendum, but actually consists in the\nestablishment that some definiendum is fit to be applied to some\ndefinitional basis on account of the relevant definiens; for instance,\nthat \u201cJohn is fit to be called \u2018man\u2019 because he is a\nrational animal,\u201d or to take a more indigenous example, that\n\u201cthe white calf is fit to be called \u2018cow\u2019 because it\nhas a hump and a dewlap.\u201d\n\nDiscussions on definition focus on the identification of the instances\nof each of the three elements (what can be a definiens, a definiendum,\nor a definitional basis) and on their respective definition, leading\nin particular to the question whether a definiens requires a\ndefiniens. Another issue is that of the nature of the distinction\nbetween the three elements.\n\nThe evaluation of a definition relies on three criteria that a correct\ndefiniens must fulfill: (i) the definiens applies to the definitional\nbasis, (ii) the definiens can be understood without relying on an\nextrinsic motive, and (iii) the definiens has the same connotation and\ndenotation as the definiendum.\n\nThe second requirement underlines a difference between the definiens\nand the definiendum, expressed in Tibetan in terms of the first being\n\u201csubstantially existent,\u201d the second \u201cnominally\nexistent.\u201d The latter thus depends on the understanding of\nsomething else\u2014here the definiens. According to the third\nrequirement, definiens and definiendum must be co-extensive, but only\na single definiens provides the specific denotation of the\ndefiniendum. For instance, \u201ccausally efficient\u201d is not the\ndefiniens of \u201cimpermanent\u201d even though everything that is\ncausally efficient is impermanent and vice-versa, because it is not\nheld to be directly contradictory to \u201cpermanent,\u201d the way\n\u201cnot remaining for a second moment\u201d (the accepted\ndefiniens of \u201cimpermanent\u201d) is.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"SouTra\">A.
