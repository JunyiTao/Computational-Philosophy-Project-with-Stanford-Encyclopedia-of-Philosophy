    "main_text": "Stem Cell-Derived Gametes\n4. Stem Cell-Derived Gametes \n\n\nRecent scientific work suggests it is possible to derive gametes from human pluripotent stem cells.  Researchers have generated sperm and eggs from mouse ESCs and iPSCs and have used these stem cell-derived gametes to produce offspring (Hayashi 2011; Hayashi 2012).\nWhile it may take several years before researchers succeed in deriving gametes from human stem cells, the research holds much promise for basic science and clinical application.  For example, the research could provide important insights into the fundamental processes of gamete biology, assist in the understanding of genetic disorders, and provide otherwise infertile individuals a means of creating genetically related children.  The ability to derive gametes from human stem cells could also reduce or eliminate the need for egg donors and thus help overcome concerns about exploitation of donors and the risks involved in egg retrieval.  Nonetheless, the research gives rise to some controversial issues related to embryos, genetics, and assisted reproductive technologies (D. Mathews et al. 2009).\n\n\nOne issue arises from the fact that some research on stem cell-derived\ngametes requires the creation of embryos, regardless of whether one is\nusing ESCs or iPSCs.  To establish that a particular technique for\nderiving human gametes from stem cells produces functional sperm and\neggs, it is necessary to demonstrate that the cells can produce an\nembryo.  This entails the creation of embryos through in vitro\nfertilization.  Since it would not be safe to implant embryos created\nduring the early stages of the research, the likely disposition of the\nembryos is that they would be destroyed.  In such instances, the\nresearch would implicate all of the moral issues surrounding the\ncreation and destruction of embryos for research.  However, the\ncreation of embryos for research in this situation would not\nnecessitate the destruction of the embryos, as it does when embryos\nare created to derive stem cell lines.  One could in principle store\nthem indefinitely rather than destroy them.  This would still leave \none subject to the objection that life is being created for\ninstrumental purposes.  But the force of the objection is questionable\nsince it is not clear that this instrumental use is any more\nobjectionable than the routine and widely accepted practice of\ncreating excess IVF embryos in the reproductive context to increase\nthe probability of generating a sufficient number of viable ones to\nproduce a pregnancy. \n Further issues emerge with the prospect of being able to produce\nlarge quantities of eggs from stem cells.  As the capacity to identify\ndisease and non-disease related alleles through preimplantation\ngenetic diagnosis (PGD) expands, the ability to create large numbers\nof embryos would substantially increase the chances of finding an\nembryo that possesses most or all of the traits one wishes to select.\nThis would be beneficial in preventing the birth of children with\ngenetic diseases.  But matters would become morally contentious if it\nwere possible to select for non-disease characteristics, such as\nsexual orientation, height, superior intelligence, memory, and musical\nability.  One common argument against using PGD in this way is that it\ncould devalue the lives of those who do not exhibit the chosen\ncharacteristics.  Another concern is that employing PGD to select for\nnon-disease traits would fail to acknowledge the \u201cgiftedness of\nlife\u201d by treating children as \u201cobjects of our design or\nproducts of our will or instruments of our ambition\u201d rather\naccepting them as they are given to us (Sandel 2004, 56).  There is\nadditionally a concern about advances in genetics heightening\ninequalities where certain traits confer social and economic\nadvantages and only the well-off have the resources to access the\ntechnology (Buchanan 1995).  Of course, one can question whether the\nselection of non-disease traits would in fact lead to devaluing other\ncharacteristics, whether it would alter the nature of parental love,\nor whether it is distinct enough from currently permitted methods of\ngaining social and economic advantage to justify regulating the\npractice.  Nonetheless, the capacity to produce human stem\ncell-derived gametes would make these issues more pressing. \n",
