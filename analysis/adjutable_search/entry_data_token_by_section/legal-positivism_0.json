    "main_text": "Development and Influence\n1. Development and Influence\n\nLegal positivism has a long history and a broad influence. It has\nantecedents in ancient political philosophy and is discussed, and the\nterm itself introduced, in mediaeval legal and political thought (see\nFinnis 1996). The modern doctrine, however, owes little to these\nforbears. Its most important roots lie in the political philosophies\nof Hobbes and Hume, and its first full elaboration is due to Jeremy\nBentham (1748\u20131832) whose account Austin adopted, modified, and\npopularized. For much of the next century an amalgam of their views,\naccording to which law is the command of a sovereign backed by force,\ndominated English philosophical reflection about law. By the\nmid-twentieth century, however, this account had lost its influence\namong working legal philosophers. Its emphasis on legislative\ninstitutions was replaced by a focus on law-applying institutions such\nas courts, and its insistence of the role of coercive force gave way\nto theories emphasizing the systematic and normative character of law.\nThe most important architects of contemporary legal positivism are the\nAustrian jurist Hans Kelsen (1881\u20131973) and the two dominating\nfigures in the analytic philosophy of law, H.L.A. Hart (1907\u201392)\nand Joseph Raz, among whom there are clear lines of influence, but\nalso important contrasts. Legal positivism\u2019s importance,\nhowever, is not confined to the philosophy of law. It can be seen\nthroughout social theory, particularly in the works of Marx, Weber,\nand Durkheim, and also among many lawyers, including the American\n\u201clegal realists\u201d and most contemporary feminist scholars.\nAlthough they disagree on many other points, these writers all\nacknowledge that law is essentially a matter of social fact. Some of\nthem are, it is true, uncomfortable with the label \u201clegal\npositivism\u201d and therefore hope to escape it. Their discomfort is\nsometimes the product of confusion. Lawyers often use\n\u201cpositivist\u201d abusively, to condemn a formalistic doctrine\naccording to which law is always clear and, however pointless or\nwrong, is to be rigorously applied by officials and obeyed by\nsubjects. It is doubtful that anyone ever held this view, but it is in\nany case false and has nothing to do with legal positivism. Among the\nphilosophically literate another, more intelligible, misunderstanding\nmay interfere. Legal positivism is here sometimes associated with the\nhomonymic but independent doctrines of logical positivism (the meaning\nof a sentence is its mode of verification) or sociological positivism\n(social phenomena can be studied only through the methods of natural\nscience). While there are historical connections and commonalities of\ntemper among these ideas, they are essentially different. The view\nthat the existence and content of law depends ultimately on social\nfacts does not rest on a particular semantic thesis, and it is\ncompatible with a range of theories about how one investigates the\nsocial world, including non-naturalistic accounts. To say that the\nexistence of law depends on facts and not on its merits is a thesis\nabout the relation among laws, facts, and merits, and not\notherwise a thesis about the individual relata. Hence, many\ntraditional \u201cnatural law\u201d moral doctrines\u2014including\nthe belief in a universal, objective morality grounded in human\nnature\u2014do not contradict legal positivism. The only influential\npositivist moral theories are the views that moral norms are\nvalid only if they have a source in divine commands or in social\nconventions. Such theists and relativists apply to morality the\nconstraints that legal positivists think hold for law.\n",
