    "main_text": "Historical Survey || Byzantine Culture and Education\n1.1 Byzantine Culture and Education\n\n\nOne conspicuous feature of Byzantine literary culture in general, and\nthe study of philosophy in particular, is its relative continuity with\nancient Greek literary culture. In Byzantium, the treasures of this\nculture never had to be discovered, as they were in the 9th-century\nArab East, or even rediscovered, as in the 12th-century Latin West. At\nall times, Homer\u2019s Iliad remained the most important\ntextbook for secondary education. Still, this continuity is not\nabsolute: considerable parts of the literary heritage were pushed into\noblivion in periods of cultural decline, some of which were eventually\nlost, whereas others survived to attract new attention during the\nsubsequent periods of intensified activity. The most important periods\nof intensified activity, so far as the history of philosophy is\nconcerned, are: (1) the late Phrygian to early Macedonian\n(842\u2013959), when ancient philosophical texts were saved for\nposterity by the production of new copies in minuscule script; (2) the\nlate Macedonian to early Komnenan (1042\u20131143); and (3) the early\nPalaiologan (1259\u20131341). Each of these periods was ushered in by\nthe establishment of an Imperial School of Philosophy in\nConstantinople. Apart from the Imperial Schools, private tutorial\nplayed an important part in higher education, some teachers attaining\nconsiderable fame, for example Nikephoros Blemmydes\n(1197\u2013c. 1269), Gregory of Cyprus (1241\u20131290), Nikephoros\nGregoras (1293/94\u20131360/61) and George Gemistos Plethon\n(c. 1360\u20131452). In the Komnenan (1182\u20131204) and\nPalaiologan (1259\u20131453) periods, the Patriarchal School loomed\nlarge, at times existing side by side with the Imperial School, but\napparently specially designated for the education of the clergy.\n\n\nThere was never in Byzantium anything resembling the autonomous\nuniversities of the Latin West. Higher education was designed to train\nofficials of the state and church, not masters of the arts and\nsciences. The Greek-speaking world was small and decreasing, and there\nwas scarcely any demand in it for very specialized scholarship.\nMoreover, theology never developed into the kind of systematic\ndiscipline it became in the Latin West, and logic was never\nacknowledged as an ancillary discipline (although it was taught at the\nPatriarchal School, at least in the Palaiologan period). All this\ncontributed to the prevalence in Byzantine higher education of an\nencyclopedic ideal, and to the preference of rhetorical over\nphilosophical studies.\n\n\nThere is reason to think that the task facing Leo the Mathematician,\nas he was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the Magnaura School\nin the mid-9th century, was to teach Aristotelian logic. In fact,\nelementary Aristotelian logic and natural philosophy combined with\nelementary mathematics would always form the standard philosophical\ncurriculum in Byzantium. Perhaps the range of courses was slightly\nexpanded in the late 1040s to the 1070s, when Michael Psellos and John\nItalos were Consuls of the Philosophers, but the standard curriculum\nwas certainly back in force at the Imperial School under George\nAkropolites in the 1260s and early 1270s. The logic texts usually\nstudied were Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge as well as\nAristotle\u2019s Categories, De interpretatione,\nPrior Analytics 1.1\u20137 and Sophistici elenchi\n1\u20137. Periodically, there seems to have been significant interest\nalso in the Posterior Analytics, since we have no fewer than\nfour extant Byzantine commentaries on the second book \u2014 in\naddition to the ancient paraphrase by Themistius and the commentary by\npseudo-Philoponus \u2014 which probably were intended to supplement\nPhiloponus\u2019 commentary on the first book. In natural philosophy,\nextracts from Aristotle\u2019s Physics, De generatione\net corruptione and Meteorology would be read, whereas\nthe mathematics course consisted mainly of Nicomachus\u2019\nIntroductio arithmetica and the first six books of\nEuclid\u2019s Elements. In many cases, students would replace\nsome or all of these texts with compendia such as the widely circulated\nEpitome logica and Epitome physica by Nikephoros\nBlemmydes, or the Logic and Quadrivium by the anonymous of\n1007 (\u2018Anonymus Heiberg\u2019)\u2014or indeed John of\nDamascus\u2019 Dialectica.\n\n\nIt deserves to be noted that before the 12th century, the whole\nByzantine output of Aristotelian commentaries dealt exclusively with\nthe works on logic. No doubt this reflects the needs of the\neducational sector at the time. Natural philosophy in the\n7th\u201311th centuries is only represented by elementary compendia\nsuch as the ones by Symeon Seth (mid- to late-11th century). There is\na commentary on the\nPhysics attributed in some manuscripts (and in Benakis\u2019\n2008 edition) to Michael Psellos, but recent research has plausibly\nsuggested that this is really the work of the late-13th-century\nscholar George Pachymeres (Golitsis 2007).  If the range of subjects\ncovered by the Aristotelian commentaries produced in the two decades\nafter 1118 is much greater, this may be due to the initiative of the\nprincess Anna Komnene, who seems to have commissioned a number of\nscholars to write commentaries on previously neglected works of\nAristotle. This was an exceptional enterprise: it would and could\nhardly have been undertaken had it not been preceded by a period of\nstrong interest in philosophy; but it left very few traces in the\nlearned activities of the immediately following decades.\n\n\nObviously, there were other forums than the schools for philosophical\ndiscourse. Photios seems to have hosted some kind of literary salon in\nhis home in the 850s or 860s, and similar gatherings,\nso-called theatra, where philosophical and other essays were\nread and discussed, constituted a central element in early Palaiologan\ncultural life (see Gaul 2011).\n",
