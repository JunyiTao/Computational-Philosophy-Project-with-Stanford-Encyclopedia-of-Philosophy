    "main_text": "Concluding remarks || Transworld identity and counterpart theory\n6.1 Transworld identity and counterpart theory\n\nOne of our initial questions (Section 1 above) was whether a\ncommitment to transworld identity\u2014the view that an individual\nexists in more than one possible world\u2014is an acceptable\ncommitment for one who believes in possible worlds. The considerations\nof Sections 4\u20135 above suggest that this commitment does involve\ngenuine (although perhaps not insuperable) problems, even for one who\nrejects David Lewis\u2019s extreme realism about the nature of\npossible worlds. The problems do not arise directly from the\nnotion of an individual\u2019s existing in more than one possible\nworld with different properties. Rather, they derive principally from\nthe fact that it is hard to accommodate all that we want to say about\nthe modal properties of ordinary individuals (including all the things\nwe want to say about their essential and accidental properties) if\nde re modal statements about such individuals are\ncharacterized in terms of their existence or non-existence in other\npossible worlds.\n\nThere is currently no consensus about the appropriate resolution of\nthese problems. In particular, there is no consensus about whether the\nadoption of counterpart theory is superior to the solutions available\nto a transworld identity theorist. A full examination of the issue\nwould require a discussion of the objections that have been raised\nagainst counterpart theory as an interpretation of de re\nmodality. And a detailed discussion of counterpart theory is beyond\nthe scope of this article. (For David Lewis\u2019s presentation of\ncounterpart theory, the reader might start with Lewis 1973,\n39\u201343, followed by (the more technical) Lewis 1968. Early\ncriticisms of Lewis\u2019s counterpart theory include those in Kripke\n1980; Plantinga 1973; and Plantinga 1974, Ch. 6. Lewis develops the\n1968 version of his counterpart theory in Lewis 1971 and 1986, Ch. 4;\nhe responds to criticisms in his \u201cPostscripts to\n\u2018Counterpart Theory and Quantified Modal Logic\u2019\u201d\n(1983, 39\u201346) and in Lewis 1986, Ch. 4. Other discussions of\ncounterpart theory include Hazen 1979, the relevant sections of Divers\n2002, Melia 2003, and the more technical treatment in Forbes 1985.\nMore recent critiques of the theory (postdating Lewis\u2019s 1986\nresponse to his critics) include Fara and Williamson 2005, Fara 2009,\nand Dorr, Hawthorne, and Yli-Vakkuri 2021, Ch. 10.)\n\nOne way to argue in favour of transworld identity (distinct from the\ndefensive strategies discussed in Sections 4 and 5 above) is what we\nmight call \u2018the argument from logical simplicity\u2019 (Linsky\nand Zalta 1994, 1996; Williamson 1998, 2000). The argument begins by\nnoting that Quantified Modal Logic\u2014which combines individual\nquantifiers and modal operators\u2014is greatly simplified when one\naccepts the validity of the Barcan scheme,\n\u2200x\u25a1A \u2192\n\u25a1\u2200xA (Marcus 1946). The resulting logic\nis sound and complete with respect to constant domain\nsemantics, in which each possible world has precisely the same\nset of individuals in its domain. The simplest philosophical\ninterpretation of this semantics is that one and the same individual\nexists at every possible world.\n\nSeveral remarks on this argument are in order. First, its conclusion\nis very strong: it says that any entity that in fact exists or that\ncould have existed exists necessarily. There is no contingent\nexistence. This goes far beyond the claim that there are genuine\nidentities across worlds. (Williamson (2002) defends this conclusion\non independent grounds.) Second, the argument does not offer an\nexplanation of how transworld identities are possible; it insists only\nthat there are genuine transworld identities. (Nevertheless, the\nmetaphysical picture that can most naturally be \u2018read off\u2019\nthe constant-domain semantics treats properties-at-a-world as\nrelations between particulars and worlds, as on McDaniel\u2019s\nmodal realism with overlap (McDaniel 2004), discussed in\nSection 1.2 above.)\n\nThird, the argument is not best understood as the claim that, if one\ndoes not accept transworld identities, then one is forced\ninto denying the Barcan scheme (and hence forced into uncomfortable\nlogical territory). That claim would be true only if the Barcan scheme\nwere validated only by constant-domain semantics, which is\nnot the case. Counterpart-theoretic semantics can be restricted so as\nto validate the Barcan scheme, by insisting that the counterpart\nrelation is an equivalence relation which, for each particular\nx and world w, relates x to a unique\nparticular in w. (One could not then interpret the\ncounterpart relation in terms of similarity, as Lewis does.) Rather,\nthe argument should be understood as the claim that the best way to\ngain the advantages of a logic containing the Barcan scheme is by\nadopting constant-domain semantics (and genuine transworld identities\nalong with it). But just which metaphysical view counts as\n\u2018best\u2019 here will involve a trade-off between many factors.\nThese include the simplicity of the constant-domain semantics, on the\none hand, but also arguments of the kind raised by Lewis against modal\nrealism with overlap, on the other.\n",
