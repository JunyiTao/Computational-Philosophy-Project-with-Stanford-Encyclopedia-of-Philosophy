    "main_text": "Controversies Surrounding Desire || The Origins of Desires\n3.2 The Origins of Desires\n\n\nThere is relatively little mystery about the generation of\ninstrumental and realizer desires. These desires are generated by\n(conscious or unconscious) reasoning processes, in which one reasons\none's way to the conclusion that if only it were the case that\np that would make it more likely that q or would be a\nrealization of q. If it so happens that one already\nintrinsically desires that q, then this reasoning process will\nautomatically and unconsciously generate an instrumental or realizer\ndesire that p, at least in rational beings. (The strength of\nthe new desire, in a rational individual, and all else being equal,\nincreases with the strength of the intrinsic desire that q and\nthe apparent usefulness of bringing it about that p toward\nbringing it about that q.) Or at least, this picture is a\nrelatively uncontroversial one among philosophers who treat\ninstrumental and realizer desires as components in a causal network\nthat might be investigated by science. Philosophers who approach the\nmind as a field for interpretation are more likely to hold a\nnon-mechanistic version of this story according to which a person\nshould be interpreted as instrumentally or realizationally desiring\np when we already interpret her as intrinsically desiring\nq and we already interpret her as believing that p\nwould make q more likely.\n\n\nThe generation of intrinsic desires is a matter of much more\ncontroversy and interest. The psychological hedonist holds that there\nis only one intrinsic desire\u2014for pleasure\u2014and this\ndesire is innate (e.g., Pollock 2006). Philosophers who believe that we\nhave a rich collection of intrinsic desires, including desires for the\nwelfare of those we love and the success of those sports teams we\nsupport, are left with more difficult questions, however. Perhaps some\nof our desires are innate (for pleasure, for gentle touches and hugs,\nfor adequate nutrition and hydration\u2026) but many of our intrinsic\ndesires clearly are not. If Ben intrinsically desires success for the\nColumbus Blue Jackets, this is certainly not a result of the innate\nstructure of his mind.\n\n\nSome have proposed that it is possible to acquire new intrinsic\ndesires by reasoning. According to Michael Smith, if one believes that,\nwere one rational, one would desire that p, then this will\ntend to generate an intrinsic desire that p. Thus, if I\nbelieve that, were I rational, I would want to give money to the Third\nWorld, then this will tend to generate an intrinsic desire in me to\ngive money to the Third World (Smith 1994). There is a difficulty here\nin evaluating Smith's idea. It certainly seems as though thinking\nabout what I would\u2014were I only perfectly rational\u2014want\nto do is the sort of thing that can generate a new desire in me. But it\nis less clear that the desire generated is intrinsic as opposed to a\nrealizer desire (a realizer for the desire to do what is rational, or\nperhaps moral). Phenomenologically, it seems difficult to distinguish\nthe two, and so it is not easy to evaluate Smith's theory. These\ndifficulties have not prevented philosophers from trying, however\n(e.g., Dreier 2000).\n\n\nAn interesting consequence of Smith's proposal is that it\nmakes it rational to have certain intrinsic desires, and irrational to\nlack other intrinsic desires, depending on what one believes to be\ntrue. This is a departure from a view of desires stemming at least from\nDavid Hume, according to which beliefs have no business dictating what\nwe should desire intrinsically. (At most, beliefs can dictate what we\nshould desire as a means or realizer to what we desire intrinsically,\naccording to this line of thought.) But it aligns Smith with those who\ntake it to be part of the business of reasoning to set \u201cfinal\nends\u201d (e.g., Richardson 1997).\n\n\nAnother proposal regarding the generation of intrinsic desires\nleaves rationality out of the picture entirely. According to this\nproposal, new intrinsic desires are acquired by associating new states\nof affairs with ones that already satisfy existing intrinsic desires,\naccording to the principles of reward-based learning. So, if a young\nchild intrinsically desires a dry bottom and a full stomach, and is\naware that its mother's presence tends to help with these things,\nthen the young child will naturally desire its mother's presence\ninstrumentally. But whether the child is aware of the instrumental\nrelationship or not, if the mother's presence often presages the\nsatisfaction of the child's intrinsic desires for a dry bottom\nand full stomach, then the learning processes generated by desire\nsatisfaction will also tend to cause the young child to acquire an\nintrinsic desire for the presence of its mother (Schroeder 2004).\n",
