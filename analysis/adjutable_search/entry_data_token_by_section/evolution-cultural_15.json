    "main_text": "Extensions and Elaborations || Macroevolution\n7. Conclusions\n\nSome of the early philosophical and methodological skirmishes over\ncultural evolution focused on grand visions for the promise of the\napproach. So, for example, Mesoudi, Whiten, and Laland (2006) argued\nthat the social sciences had stagnated, while the biological sciences\nhad shown significant progress. They suggested that this pointed\ntowards an evolutionary synthesis within the social sciences that\nwould parallel biology\u2019s own, and which would have a form of\nnatural selection at its core. Perhaps unsurprisingly, such a bold set\nof claims attracted vigorous responses that were equally sweeping; Tim\nIngold (2007) aimed to diagnose fundamental flaws within the entire\nenterprise of cultural evolution; Fracchia and Lewontin (1999)\nsuggested a series of in-principle topics (associated, for example,\nwith phenomena of power, and with the failures of methodological\nindividualism) which, they argued, undermined the ability of cultural\nevolutionary approaches to provide informative explanation.\n\nThis entry has pointed towards a different vision for cultural\nevolutionary work. Instead of beginning with a broad diagnosis of the\nsupposed failures of social science, or of the presence within culture\nof the general conditions required for natural selection processes to\nact, the cultural evolution project can be understood in a more\neclectic manner. It seeks to explore the significance of various forms\nof learning not just in humans, but in many other species. Although\nthis article has focused primarily on humans, cultural evolutionary\nscience increasingly investigates how learning influences adaptation\nand diversification in primates, birds, and fish. This prompts a\nseries of live research questions: how widespread are these learning\nabilities, and why did they arise in the first place? What explains\nwhy some species possess them in apparently very different forms to\nothers? How does change brought about by learning interact with other\nforms of change studied by evolutionists? What sorts of conditions are\nrequired for learning to promote long-lasting diversification within\nspecies? What sorts of conditions are required for learning to promote\nincremental improvements with respect to functional behaviours, or\nartifacts? In what ways does learning facilitate or impede the\norigination of other-regarding behavior, or systems of communication?\nAn approach focusing on these sorts of questions is free to co-opt and\ncollaborate with successful research strands in the mainstream social\nsciences, just as it is free to co-opt and adapt explanatory models\nwhich sometimes have their origins in disciplines like population\ngenetics, but which can just as well have their origins in\nepidemiology or economics.\n",
