    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Theoretical Philosophy || The Mind in the World: Psychology, Ethology, and Freedom\n3.5 The Mind in the World: Psychology, Ethology, and Freedom\n\nAs was noted above\n (\u00a72.1),\n Mill\u2019s naturalism involves the claim that human beings and\ntheir minds are wholly a part of nature. As such, they are subject to\ncausal laws in just the same manner as the rest of natural\nworld\u2014empirical study of the mind, Mill holds, reveals that it\nis governed by the laws of associationistic psychology. Mill\u2019s\nassociationism differs in key respects from that of his\npredecessors\u2014he shows more concern to do justice to the\nspontaneity of mind (Bain\u2019s Psychology, XI: 335), the\nworld-directed nature of representational thought (Notes on the\nAnalysis, XXXI: 413), and the fact that some complex ideas cannot\nbe accounted for in terms of the mechanical combination of simple\nideas present in sense experience (System, VIII:\n852\u20136). Such modifications of his associationistic inheritance\nwere, in part, a reaction to points made by the Germano-Coleridgean\nschool. His account, nevertheless, remains firmly within the tradition\nof British empiricism\u2014and he never wavers from a commitment to\nthe claim that our mental life is governed by causal laws operating in\na deterministic fashion. Indeed, Mill holds out hope that our\nunderstanding of such laws will improve\u2014and even shows interest\nin the promise of understanding the \u201cmaterial conditions\u201d\nof thought in the brain and nervous system (Bain\u2019s\nPsychology, XI: 348).\n\nThe character of the mind of an individual, Mill holds, is a function\nentirely of the experiences that individual has undergone. In this\nsense, Mill holds firm to the eighteenth-century empiricists\u2019\ndoctrine of the tabula rasa. In Mill\u2019s hands, however,\nit becomes transformed into a characteristically nineteenth-century\nclaim that human nature itself is malleable (Mandelbaum 1971: 141ff.).\nSpecific experiences, to be sure, write their lessons on our\nminds\u2014but background conditions, which differ from culture to\nculture, play an equally important role. Such acculturation affects\nthe characters, desires, and dispositions of human beings, which vary\nradically depending on the setting of human beings\u2014a point noted\nby many of Mill\u2019s romantic contemporaries, and one which\ninfluenced the direction of his utilitarianism. Human nature exhibits\n\u201castonishingly pliability\u201d (Civilization, XVIII:\n145). \n\n\n[I]f there are some tendencies of human nature [\u2026] which are\nthe same in all ages and countries, these never form the whole of the\ntendencies. (Spirit of the Age, XXII: 256\u20137) \n\n\nBut it also affects our beliefs and our modes of perceiving the world.\nAs Mill notes,\n\n\nA great part of what seems observation is really inference [\u2026]\nFor in almost every act of our perceiving faculties, observation and\ninferences are intimately blended. What we are said to observe is\nusually a compound result, of which one-tenth may be observation, and\nthe remaining nine-tenths inference. (System, VIII:\n641\u20132)\n\n\nWhat are properly inferences from our observations come by processes\nof association to seem as observations themselves. I observe,\nproperly, only a certain sensory manifold, and infer that this is my\nbrother\u2014but, with repetition, the inference becomes merged by\nassociation with the observation, and I take the inferred content to\nbe part of the observation itself. Processes of association, that is\nto say, renders our observations deeply theory laden. And the theories\nwith which they are laden, of course, will vary with social\nsetting.\n\nThe systematic science treating the topic of how upbringing and\nenvironment affect the formation of individuals, Mill terms\n\u201cethology\u201d (System, VIII: 861). Such a science,\nwhich would utilize the principles of psychology to allow us to\ndetermine the conditions most conducive or damaging to the production\nof characters we think desirable, \u201cis still to be created\u201d\n(System, VIII: 872\u20133). Nevertheless, much of\nMill\u2019s work can be seen as an attempt to start such a research\nprogramme, charting the effects of social conditions on the creation\nof character\u2014his own character in the Autobiography,\nthat of women in the Subjection, and those of democratic\nsocieties in On Liberty (Ball 2010).\n\nIndividuals\u2019 characters are the result of causal\nprocesses\u2014and such characters determine their actions. \n\n\nNo one who believed that he knew thoroughly the circumstances of any\ncase, and the characters of the different persons concerned, would\nhesitate to foretell how all of them would act. (System,\nVIII: 837) \n\n\nGiven that individuals are subject to such laws, there is\nlittle reason to think that the societies composed of\nindividuals will not be subject to natural laws (System,\nVIII: 879). And, indeed, Mill thinks it possible to specify laws by\nwhich societies evolve from the state of barbarism to\ncivilization\u2014\u201claws which regulate the succession between\none state of society and another\u201d (System, VIII:\n912)\u2014and chart, scientifically, the process of history (Levin\n2004; see also Macleod 2017). \u201cThe order of human\nprogress\u201d is guided with \u201ca sort of necessity established\n[\u2026] by the general laws of human nature\u201d\n(System, VIII: 938).\n\nUnderstanding the human world scientifically\u2014understanding it as\npart of the natural world\u2014of course puts pressure on\nthe notion that human beings are in any real sense free. Mill is clear\nthat human actions could be \u201cunerringly inferred\u201d if their\nantecedents were known, but nevertheless maintains that this\ndeterministic stance does not \u201cconflict in the smallest degree\nwith what is called our feeling of freedom\u201d (System,\nVIII: 837). Our actions are causally determined, but nevertheless,\nMill maintains, we are free (Ryan 1987: 103\u2013131). Mill adopts a\ncompatibilist account of human freedom. Although it is true that our\ncharacter and desires, in combination with a set of circumstances,\ncausally necessitates some particular action, it is not true\nthat if that person had some alternative character and set of\ndesires that that same cause would necessitate that same action. Had\nthat person had different desires, or a different character, he might\nwell have acted differently. This, Mill concedes, would be of little\nconsolation if our character and desires are beyond the control of an\nindividual to influence. But, he points out, we can influence\nour character and desires. We can place ourselves in circumstances\nthat modify our character, and we can practice better habits. \n\n\n[I]f we examine closely, we shall find that this feeling, of our being\nable to modify our own character if we wish, is itself the\nfeeling of moral freedom which we are conscious of. (System,\nVIII: 841)\n\n",
