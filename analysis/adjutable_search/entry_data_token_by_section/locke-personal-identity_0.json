    "main_text": "Locke on Persons and Personal Identity: The Basics\n1. Locke on Persons and Personal Identity: The Basics\n\nLocke\u2019s most thorough discussion of the persistence (or\ndiachronic identity) of persons can be found in Book 2, Chapter 27 of\nthe Essay (\u201cOf Identity and Diversity\u201d), though\nLocke anticipates this discussion as early as Book 1, Chapter 4,\nSection 5, and Locke refers to persons in other texts, including the\nSecond Treatise of Government. The discussion of persons and\ntheir persistence conditions also features prominently in\nLocke\u2019s lengthy exchange with Edward Stillingfleet, Bishop of\nWorcester (1697\u20131699).\n\nLocke begins \u201cOf Identity and Diversity\u201d by first getting\nclear on the principle of individuation, and by setting out what some\nhave called the place-time-kind principle\u2014which stipulates that\nno two things of the same kind can be in the same place at the same\ntime, and no individual can be in two different places at the same\ntime (L-N\n 2.27.1).[2]\n With some of the basics of identity in place, Locke posits that\nbefore we can determine the persistence conditions for atoms, masses\nof matter, plants, animals, men, or persons, we must first know what\nwe mean by these terms. In other words, before we can determine what\nmakes atoms, masses of matter, plants, animals, men, or persons the\nsame over time, we must pin down the nominal essences\u2014or general\nideas\u2014for these kinds. Of this Locke says, \n\n\n\u2019Tis not therefore Unity of Substance that comprehends all sorts\nof Identity, or will determine it in every Case: But to\nconceive, and judge of it aright, we must consider what Idea\nthe Word it is applied to stands for\u2026. (L-N 2.27.7)\n\n\nThat we must define a kind term before determining the persistence\nconditions for that kind is underscored in Locke\u2019s definition of\n\u201cperson\u201d. Locke starts off by saying, \n\n\nThis being premised to find wherein personal Identity\nconsists, we must consider what Person stands for\u2026.\n\n\n\nHe goes on, \n\n\nwhich, I think, is a thinking intelligent Being, that has reason and\nreflection, and can consider it self as itself, the same thinking\nthing in different times and places\u2026. (L-N 2.27.9) \n\n\nA person for Locke is thus the kind of entity that can think self\nreflectively, and think of itself as persisting over time. \n\nLocke additionally asserts that persons are agents. For Locke\n\u201cperson\u201d is a \n\n\n\u2026Forensick Term appropriating Actions and their Merit; and so\nbelongs only to intelligent Agents capable of a Law, and Happiness and\nMisery. (L-N 2.27.26) \n\n\nPersons are therefore not just thinking intelligent beings that can\nreason and reflect, and consider themselves as the same thinking\nthings in different times and places, but also entities that can be\nheld accountable for their actions. It is because persons can\nthink of themselves as persisting over time that they can, and do,\nplan ahead, with an eye toward the punishment or reward that may\nfollow.\n\nJust after Locke defines \u201cperson\u201d, he begins to elucidate\nwhat makes any person the same person over time. He asserts that \n\n\n\u2026consciousness always accompanies thinking, and \u2018tis\nthat, that makes every one to be, what he calls self. (L-N\n2.27.9) \n\n\nConsciousness is what distinguishes selves, and thus, \n\n\n\u2026in this alone consists personal Identity, i.e. the\nsameness of rational Being: And as far as this consciousness can be\nextended backwards to any past Action or Thought, so far reaches the\nIdentity of that Person; it is the same self now it\nwas then; and \u2018tis by the same self with this present\none that now reflects on it, that that Action was done. (L-N 2.27.9)\n\n\n\nAfter the initial assertion that the diachronic identity of persons\nconsists in sameness of consciousness, Locke goes on to use various\nimaginary cases to drive this point home.\n\nThe imaginary cases that Locke employs are not dissimilar to ancient\ncases, such as the Ship of Theseus, reported by Plutarch. In this\ncase, we are asked to imagine a ship that has slowly had its planks\nreplaced with new ones. The intuition Plutarch\u2019s case is\nintended to test is whether, at the end (when the ship has an entirely\nnew material constitution), we have the same ship as before. Likewise,\nLocke is using cases to test readers\u2019 intuitions about\npersistence and identity. But it is arguable that Locke is the first\nto devise such cases to specifically test readers\u2019 intuitions\nabout persons and the conditions under which they are the\nsame. Locke is thus carving out a new conceptual space through such\nimaginary cases. A few of these will be outlined and discussed in what\nfollows. \n\nIn the \u201cprince and the cobbler\u201d passage, or L-N 2.27.15,\nLocke asks the reader to imagine the soul of a prince entering and\ninforming the body of a cobbler, taking all of its \u201cprincely\nthoughts\u201d with it. In this scenario, the person called\n\u201cprince\u201d ends up persisting in the man identified as the\n\u201ccobbler\u201d, because the prince\u2019s consciousness goes\nalong with the prince\u2019s soul. Just after Locke describes this\nscenario, he says, \n\n\nI know that in the ordinary way of speaking, the same Person, and the\nsame Man, stand for one and the same thing. And indeed every one will\nalways have a liberty to speak, as he pleases, and to apply what\narticulate Sounds to what Ideas he thinks fit, and change\nthem as often as he pleases. But yet when we will enquire, what makes\nthe same Spirit, Man, or Person, in our Minds; and\nhaving resolved with our selves what we mean by them, it will not be\nhard to determine, in either of them, or the like, when it is the\nsame, and when not. (L-N 2.27.15)\n\n\nThrough the \u201cprince and the cobbler\u201d passage it not only\nbecomes clear that a person goes where their consciousness goes, but\nalso that Locke distinguishes between the term \u201cman\u201d\n(which is synonymous with \u201chuman being\u201d) and\n\u201cperson\u201d.\n\nOther scenarios that Locke conjures, such as the \u201cwaking and\nsleeping Socrates\u201d case (L-N 2.27.19), make clear that even if\nan individual remains the same man, he may not persist as the same\nperson. Here Locke says,\n\n\nIf the same Socrates waking and sleeping do not partake of\nthe same consciousness, Socrates waking and sleeping\nis not the same Person. And to punish Socrates waking, for\nwhat sleeping Socrates thought, and waking Socrates\nwas never conscious of, would be no more of Right, than to punish one\nTwin for what his Brother-Twin did, whereof he knew nothing, because\ntheir outsides were so like, that they could not be distinguished; for\nsuch Twins have been seen. (L-N 2.27.19)\n\n\nIf Socrates has a different consciousness by day than he does by\nnight, then waking Socrates ought not be punished for what sleeping\nSocrates does. This is because although Socrates is the same man by\nday as he is by night, he is a different person by day than he is at\nnight (and moral responsibility lies with persons, according to\nLocke). Thus while the identity of consciousness determines the\nidentity of person, the identity of persons and the identity of men\ncome apart for Locke\u2014or at least they\n can.[3]\n\n\nLocke additionally distinguishes between persons and souls. There is\nevidence for this in L-N 2.27.13. Here Locke claims, \n\n\nBut yet to return to the Question before us, it must be allowed, That\nif the same consciousness \u2026 can be transferr\u2019d from one\nthinking Substance to another, it will be possible, that two thinking\nSubstances may make but one Person. \n\n\nIf consciousness can actually be transferred from one soul to another,\nthen a person can persist, despite a change in the soul to which her\nconsciousness is annexed. Thus if a reader\u2019s soul switches out\nas she progresses from the start of L-N 2.27 to the end, so long as\nthe reader\u2019s consciousness remains the same, she remains the\nsame person, according to Locke.\n\nOn top of this, Locke asserts that even if an individual has the same\nsoul, he may fail to be the same person. Locke makes this point in L-N\n2.27.14, 23, and 24. In the \u201cday and night-man\u201d passage,\nor 2.27.23, Locke asks the reader to imagine \u201c\u2026two\ndistinct incommunicable consciousnesses acting the same Body, the one\nconstantly by Day, the other by Night\u201d (L-N 2.27.23). Locke goes\non to suggest that the \u201c\u2026Day and the\nNight-man\u201d are \u201cas distinct persons as\nSocrates and Plato\u201d (L-N 2.27.23). Locke then\nmakes clear that this is the case even if day and night-man share the\nsame soul:\n\n\nFor granting that the thinking Substance in Man must be necessarily\nsuppos\u2019d immaterial, \u2018tis evident, that immaterial\nthinking thing may sometimes part with its past consciousness, and be\nrestored to it again, as appears in the forgetfulness Men often have\nof their past Actions, and the Mind many times recovers the memory of\na past consciousness, which it had lost for twenty Years together.\nMake these intervals of Memory and Forgetfulness to take their turns\nregularly by Day and Night, and you have two Persons with the same\nimmaterial Spirit, as much as in the former instance two Persons with\nthe same Body. So that self is not determined by Identity or\nDiversity of Substance\u2026but only by identity of consciousness.\n(L-N 2.27.23) \n\n\nJust as the \u201cwaking and sleeping Socrates\u201d passage, L-N\n2.27.23 shows that there can be a change of person due to a change in\nconsciousness, and this is the case even though there is no change in\nman. But, what Locke also makes clear through L-N 2.27.23 is that\nthere can be a change of person even though there is no change in\nsoul. Thus while many philosophers (including Plato, Rene Descartes,\nSamuel Clarke, etc.) think that one cannot be a person unless one has\nan immaterial soul, and the identity of persons rests in the identity\nof souls, Locke makes the bold move of pulling persons and souls\napart.\n\nIn addition to this, Locke calls the substantial nature of souls into\nquestion. Locke takes thought to be immaterial, and while Locke\ncontends that the immaterial cannot be reduced to, or explained in\nterms of, the material, Locke is not committed to substance dualism,\nwhen it comes to finite thinkers. This is because Locke thinks\nsubstratum\u2014or the substance that underlies and supports any\nparticular substance\u2019s qualities\u2014is impossible for finite\nminds to penetrate. Additionally there is nothing in the concepts\n\u201cthought\u201d and \u201cmatter\u201d that allows us to\ndeduce that one excludes the other, and God could have superadded the\nability to think to formerly inert systems of matter. In Locke\u2019s\npicture, we cannot know whether the substance (or substratum) that\nunderlies thinking and willing is different from the substance (or\nsubstratum) that underlies being solid and white, or yellow and\nmalleable. Locke\u2019s official position on the substantial nature\nof finite thinkers is therefore one of agnosticism.\n",
