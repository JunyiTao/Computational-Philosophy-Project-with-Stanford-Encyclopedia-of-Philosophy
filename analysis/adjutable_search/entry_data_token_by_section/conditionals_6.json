    "main_text": "The Suppositional Theory || Conditional Belief and Conditional Probability\n3.1 Conditional Belief and Conditional Probability\n\nLet us put truth conditions aside for a while, and ask what it is to\nbelieve, or to be more or less certain, that \\(B\\) if \\(A\\) \u2014\nthat John cooked the dinner if Mary didn\u2019t, that you will\nrecover if you have the operation, and so forth. How do you make such\na judgement? You suppose (assume, hypothesise) that \\(A\\), and make a\nhypothetical judgement about \\(B\\), under the supposition that \\(A\\),\nin the light of your other beliefs. Frank Ramsey put it like this:\n\n\nIf two people are arguing \u201cIf \\(p\\), will \\(q\\)?\u201d and are\nboth in doubt as to \\(p\\), they are adding \\(p\\) hypothetically to\ntheir stock of knowledge, and arguing on that basis about \\(q\\);\n\u2026 they are fixing their degrees of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)\n(1929, p. 247).\n\n\nA suppositional theory was advanced by J. L. Mackie (1973, chapter 4).\nSee also David Barnett (2006). Peter G\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s work\n(1986, 1988) could also come under this heading. But the most fruitful\ndevelopment of the idea (in my view) takes seriously the last part of\nthe above quote from Ramsey, and emphasises the fact that conditionals\ncan be accepted with different degrees of closeness to certainty.\nErnest Adams (1965, 1966, 1975) has developed such a theory. \n\nWhen we are neither certain that \\(B\\) nor certain that \\({\\sim}B\\),\nthere remains a range of epistemic attitudes we may have to \\(B\\): we\nmay be nearly certain that \\(B\\), think \\(B\\) more likely than not,\netc.. Similarly, we may be certain, nearly certain, etc. that \\(B\\)\ngiven the supposition that \\(A\\). Make the idealizing assumption that\ndegrees of closeness to certainty can be quantified: 100% certain, 90%\ncertain, etc.; and we can turn to probability theory for what Ramsey\ncalled the \u201clogic of partial belief\u201d. There we find a\nwell-established, indispensable concept, \u201cthe conditional\nprobability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\)\u201d. It is to this notion that\nRamsey refers by the phrase \u201cdegrees of belief in \\(q\\) given\n\\(p\\)\u201d.\n\nIt is, at first sight, rather curious that the best-developed and most\nilluminating suppositional theory should place emphasis on uncertain\nconditional judgements. If we knew the truth conditions of\nconditionals, we would handle uncertainty about conditionals in terms\nof a general theory of what it is to be uncertain of the truth of a\nproposition. But there is no consensus about the truth conditions of\nconditionals. It happens that when we turn to the theory of uncertain\njudgements, we find a concept of conditionality in use. It is worth\nseeing what we can learn from it.\n\nThe notion of conditional probability entered probability theory at an\nearly stage because it was needed to compute the probability of a\nconjunction. Thomas Bayes (1763) wrote:\n\nThe probability that two \u2026 events will both happen is \u2026\nthe probability of the first [multiplied by] the probability of the\nsecond on the supposition that the first happens [my\nemphasis].\n\n\nA simple example: a ball is picked at random. 70% of the balls are red\n(so the probability that a red ball is picked is 70%). 60% of the red\nballs have a black spot (so the probability that a ball with a black\nspot is picked, on the supposition that a red ball is picked, is 60%).\nThe probability that a red ball with a black spot is picked is 60% of\n70%, i.e. 42%. \n\nRamsey, arguing that \u201cdegrees of belief\u201d should conform to\nprobability theory, stated the same \u201cfundamental law of partial\nbelief\u201d:\n\nDegree of belief in \\((p\\) and \\(q) =\\) degree of belief in \\(p\n\\times\\) degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\). (1926, p. 77)\n\n\nFor example, you are about 50% certain that the test will be on\nconditionals, and about 80% certain that you will pass, on the\nsupposition that it is on conditionals. So you are about 40% certain\nthat the test will be on conditionals and you will pass. \n\nAccepting Ramsey\u2019s suggestion that \u201cif\u201d,\n\u201cgiven that\u201d, \u201con the supposition that\u201d come\nto the same thing, writing \u201c\\(\\mathbf{p}(B)\\)\u201d for\n\u201cdegree of belief in \\(B\\)\u201d, and \u201c\\(\\mathbf{p}_A\n(B)\\)\u201d for \u201cdegree of belief in \\(B\\) given \\(A\\)\u201d,\nand rearranging the basic law, we have: \n\n\\[ \n\\mathbf{p}(B \\text{ if } A) = \\mathbf{p}_A (B) = \n \\frac{\\mathbf{p}(A \\amp B)}{\\mathbf{p}(A)}, \\text{ provided } \\mathbf{p}(A) \\text{ is not } 0.\n\\]\n\n\nCall a set of mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive propositions a\npartition. The lines of a truth table constitute a partition.\nOne\u2019s degrees of belief in the members of a partition, idealized\nas precise, should sum to 100%. That is all there is to the claim that\ndegrees of belief should have the structure of probabilities. Consider\na partition of the form \\(\\{A \\amp B, A \\amp{\\sim}B, {\\sim}A\\}\\).\nSuppose someone X thinks it 50% likely that \\({\\sim}A\\) (hence 50%\nlikely that \\(A), 40\\)% likely that \\(A \\amp B\\), and 10% likely that\n\\(A \\amp{\\sim}B\\). Think of this distribution as displayed\ngeometrically, as follows. Draw a long narrow horizontal rectangle.\nDivide it in half by a vertical line. Write \u201c\\({\\sim}A\\)\u201d\nin the right-hand half. Divide the left-hand half with another\nvertical line, in the ratio 4:1, with the larger part on the left.\nWrite \u201c\\(A \\amp B\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(A \\amp{\\sim}B\\)\u201d\nin the larger and smaller cells respectively.\n\n\n\\(A \\amp B\\)\n\\(A \\amp{\\sim}B\\)\n\\({\\sim}A\\) \n\n\n(Note that as \\(\\{A \\amp B, A \\amp{\\sim}B, {\\sim}A\\}\\) and \\(\\{A,\n{\\sim}A\\}\\) are both partitions, it follows that \\(\\mathbf{p}(A) =\n\\mathbf{p}(A \\amp B) + \\mathbf{p}(A \\amp{\\sim}B)\\).)\n\nHow does X evaluate \u201cIf \\(A, B\\)\u201d? She assumes that \\(A\\),\nthat is, hypothetically eliminates \\({\\sim}A\\). In the part of the\npartition that remains, in which \\(A\\) is true, \\(B\\) is four times as\nlikely as \\({\\sim}B\\); that is, on the assumption that \\(A\\), it is\nfour to one that \\(B: \\mathbf{p}(B\\) if \\(A)\\) is 80%,\n\\(\\mathbf{p}({\\sim}B\\) if \\(A)\\) is 20%. Equivalently, as \\(A \\amp B\\)\nis four times as likely as \\(A \\amp{\\sim}B, \\mathbf{p}(B\\) if \\(A)\\)\nis 4/5, or 80%. Equivalently, \\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\amp B)\\) is 4/5 of\n\\(\\mathbf{p}(A)\\). In non-numerical terms: you believe that if \\(A,\nB\\) to the extent that you think that \\(A \\amp B\\) is nearly as likely\nas \\(A\\); or, to the extent that you think \\(A \\amp B\\) is much more\nlikely than \\(A \\amp{\\sim}B\\). If you think \\(A \\amp B\\) is as likely\nas \\(A\\), you are certain that if \\(A, B\\). In this case, your\n\\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\amp{\\sim}B) = 0\\).\n\nGo back to the truth table. You are wondering whether if \\(A, B\\).\nAssume \\(A\\). That is, ignore lines 3 and 4 in which \\(A\\) is false.\nAsk yourself about the relative probabilities of lines 1 and 2.\nSuppose you think line 1 is about 100 times more likely than line 2.\nThen you think it is about 100 to 1 that \\(B\\) if \\(A\\).\n\nNote: these thought-experiments can only be performed when\n\\(\\mathbf{p}(A)\\) is not 0. On this approach, indicative conditionals\nonly have a role when the thinker takes \\(A\\) to be an epistemic\npossibility. If you take yourself to know for sure that Ann is in\nParis, you don\u2019t go in for \u201cIf Ann is not in Paris\n\u2026\u201d thoughts (though of course you can think \u201cIf Ann\nhad not been in Paris \u2026\u201d). In conversation, you can\npretend to take something as an epistemic possibility, temporarily, to\ncomply with the epistemic state of the hearer. When playing the\nsceptic, there are not many limits on what you can, at a\npinch, take as an epistemic possibility \u2013 as not already ruled\nout. But there are some limits, as Descartes found. Is there a\nconditional thought that begins \u201cIf I don\u2019t exist now\n\u2026\u201d?\n\nOn Hook\u2019s account, to be close to certain that if \\(A, B\\) is to\ngive a high value to \\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\supset B)\\). How does\n\\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\supset B)\\) compare with \\(\\mathbf{p}_A (B)\\)? In two\nspecial cases, they are equal: first, if \\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\amp{\\sim}B) =\n0\\) (and \\(\\mathbf{p}(A)\\) is not 0), \\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\supset B) =\n\\mathbf{p}_A (B) = 1\\) (i.e. 100%). Second, if \\(\\mathbf{p}(A) =\n100\\)%, \\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\supset B) = \\mathbf{p}_A (B) =\n\\mathbf{p}(B)\\). In all other cases, \\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\supset B)\\) is\ngreater than \\(\\mathbf{p}_A (B)\\). To see this we need to compare\n\\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\amp{\\sim}B)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{p}(A\n\\amp{\\sim}B)/\\mathbf{p}(A)\\). Consider again the partition \\(\\{A \\amp\nB, A \\amp{\\sim}B, {\\sim}A\\}. \\mathbf{p}(A \\amp{\\sim}B)\\) is a smaller\nproportion of the whole space than it is of the \\(A\\)-part \u2014 the\npart of the space in which \\(A\\) is true \u2014 except in the special\ncases in which \\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\amp{\\sim}B) = 0\\), or\n\\(\\mathbf{p}({\\sim}A) = 0\\). So, except in these special cases,\n\\(\\mathbf{p}_A ({\\sim}B)\\) is greater than \\(\\mathbf{p}(A\n\\amp{\\sim}B)\\). Now \\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\supset B) = \\mathbf{p}({\\sim}(A\n\\amp{\\sim}B))\\); and \\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\amp{\\sim}B) + \\mathbf{p}({\\sim}(A\n\\amp{\\sim}B)) = 1\\). Also \\(\\mathbf{p}_A (B) + \\mathbf{p}_A ({\\sim}B)\n= 1\\). So from \\(\\mathbf{p}_A ({\\sim}B) \\gt \\mathbf{p}(A\n\\amp{\\sim}B)\\) it follows that \\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\supset B) \\gt\n\\mathbf{p}_A (B)\\).\n\nHook and the suppositional theorist (call her Supp) come spectacularly\napart when \\(\\mathbf{p}({\\sim}A)\\) is high and \\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\amp\nB)\\) is much smaller than \\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\amp{\\sim}B)\\). Let\n\\(\\mathbf{p}({\\sim}A) = 90\\)%, \\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\amp B) = 1\\)%,\n\\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\amp{\\sim}B) = 9\\)%. \\(\\mathbf{p}_A (B) = 10\\)%.\n\\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\supset B) = 91\\)%. For instance, I am 90% certain that\nSue won\u2019t be offered the job \\(({\\sim}O)\\), and think it only\n10% likely that she will decline the offer \\((D)\\) if it is made, that\nis \\(\\mathbf{p}_O (D) = 10\\)%. \\(\\mathbf{p}(O \\supset D) =\n\\mathbf{p}({\\sim}O \\text{ or } (O \\amp D)) = 91\\)%.\n\nNow let us compare Hook, Arrow, and Supp with respect to two questions\nraised in \u00a72.\n\nQuestion 1. You are certain that \\({\\sim}(A \\amp{\\sim}B)\\), but\nnot certain that \\({\\sim}A\\). Should you be certain that if \\(A, B\\)?\n\n\nHook: yes. Because \u201c\\(A \\supset B\\)\u201d is true whenever \\(A\n\\amp{\\sim}B\\) is false.\n\nSupp: yes. Because \\(A \\amp B\\) is as likely as \\(A. \\mathbf{p}_A (B)\n= 1\\).\n\nArrow: no, not necessarily. For \u201c\\(A \\rightarrow B\\)\u201d may\nbe false when \\(A \\amp{\\sim}B\\) is false. With just the information\nthat \\(A \\amp{\\sim}B\\) is false, I should not be certain that if \\(A,\nB\\). \nQuestion 2. If you think it likely that \\({\\sim}A\\), might you\nstill think it unlikely that if \\(A, B\\)?\n\n\nHook: no. \u201c\\(A \\supset B\\)\u201d is true in all the possible\nsituations in which \\({\\sim}A\\) is true. If I think it likely that\n\\({\\sim}A\\), I think it likely that a sufficient condition for the\ntruth of \u201c\\(A \\supset B\\)\u201d obtains. I must, therefore,\nthink it likely that if \\(A, B\\).\n\nSupp: yes. We had an example above. That most of my probability goes\nto \\({\\sim}A\\) leaves open the question whether or not \\(A \\amp B\\) is\nmore probable than \\(A \\amp{\\sim}B\\). If \\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\amp{\\sim}B)\\)\nis greater than \\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\amp B)\\), I think it\u2019s unlikely\nthat if \\(A, B\\). That\u2019s compatible with thinking it likely that\n\\({\\sim}A\\).\n\nArrow: yes. \u201cIf \\(A, B\\)\u201d may be false when \\(A\\) is\nfalse. And I might well think it likely that that possibility obtains,\ni.e. unlikely that \u201cIf \\(A, B\\)\u201d is true. \n\n\nSupp has squared the circle: she gets the intuitively right answer to\nboth questions. In this she differs from both Hook and Arrow.\nSupp\u2019s way of assessing conditionals is incompatible with the\ntruth-functional way (they answer Question 2 differently); and\nincompatible with stronger-than-truth-functional truth conditions\n(they answer Question 1 differently). It follows that Supp\u2019s way\nof assessing conditionals is incompatible with the claim that\nconditionals have truth conditions of any kind. \\(\\mathbf{p}_A (B)\\)\ndoes not measure the probability of the truth of any proposition.\nSuppose it did measure the probability of the truth of some\nproposition \\(A*B\\). Either \\(A*B\\) is entailed by \u201c\\(A \\supset\nB\\)\u201d, or it is not. If it is, it is true whenever \\({\\sim}A\\) is\ntrue, and hence cannot be improbable when \\({\\sim}A\\) is probable.\nThat is, it cannot agree with Supp in its answer to Question 2. If\n\\(A*B\\) is not entailed by \u201c\\(A \\supset B\\)\u201d, it may be\nfalse when \\({\\sim}(A \\amp{\\sim}B)\\) is true, and hence certainty that\n\\({\\sim}(A \\amp{\\sim}B)\\) (in the absence of certainty that\n\\({\\sim}A)\\) is insufficient for certainty that \\(A*B\\); it cannot\nagree with Supp in its answer to Question 1. \n\nTo make the point in a slightly different way, let me adopt the\nfollowing as an expository, heuristic device, a harmless fiction.\nImagine a partition as carved into a large finite number of\nequally-probable chunks, such that the propositions with which we are\nconcerned are true in an exact number of them. The probability of any\nproposition is the proportion of chunks in which it is true. The\nprobability of \\(B\\) on the supposition that \\(A\\) is the proportion\nof the \\(A\\)-chunks (the chunks in which \\(A\\) is\ntrue) which are \\(B\\)-chunks. With some misgivings, I succumb to the\ntemptation to call these chunks \u201cworlds\u201d: they are equally\nprobable, mutually incompatible and jointly exhaustive epistemic\npossibilities, enough of them for the propositions with which we are\nconcerned to be true, or false, at each world. The heuristic value is\nthat judgements of probability and conditional probability then\ntranslate into statements about proportions.\n\nAlthough Supp and Hook give the same answer to Question 1, their\nreasons are different. Supp answers \u201cyes\u201d not\nbecause a proposition, \\(A*B\\), is true whenever \\(A \\amp{\\sim}B\\) is\nfalse; but because \\(B\\) is true in all the \u201cworlds\u201d which\nmatter for the assessment of \u201cIf \\(A, B\\)\u201d: the\n\\(A\\)-worlds. Although Supp and Arrow give the same answer to Question\n2, their reasons are different. Supp answers \u201cyes\u201d, not\nbecause a proposition \\(A*B\\) may be false when \\(A\\) is false; but\nbecause the fact that most worlds are \\({\\sim}A\\)-worlds is irrelevant\nto whether most of the \\(A\\)-worlds are\n\\(B\\)-worlds. To judge that \\(B\\) is true on the supposition\nthat \\(A\\) is true, it turns out, is not to judge that\nsomething-or-other, \\(A*B\\), is true.\n\nBy a different argument, David Lewis (1976) was the first to prove\nthis remarkable result: there is no proposition \\(A*B\\) such that, in\nall probability distributions, \\(\\mathbf{p}(A*B) = \\mathbf{p}_A (B)\\).\nConditional probability does not measure the probability of the truth\nof any proposition. If a conditional has truth conditions, one should\nbelieve it to the extent that one thinks it is probably true. If Supp\nis correct, that one believes \u201cIf \\(A, B\\)\u201d to the extent\nthat one thinks it probable that \\(B\\) on the supposition that \\(A\\),\nthen this is not equivalent to believing some proposition to be\nprobably true. Hence, it appears, if Supp is right, conditionals\nshouldn\u2019t be construed as having truth conditions at all. A\nconditional judgement involves two propositions, which play different\nroles. One is the content of a supposition. The other is the content\nof a judgement made under that supposition. They do not combine to\nyield a single proposition which is judged to be likely to be true\njust when the second is judged likely to be true on the supposition of\nthe first.\n\n(Lewis called his proofs \u201ctriviality results\u201d, because the\nconclusions are avoided only in a trivial probability space which is\nincapable of giving positive probability to more than two incompatible\npropositions\u2014for instance, is incapable of giving positive\nprobability to \\(A \\amp B, A \\amp{\\sim}B\\), and \\({\\sim}A\\). The name\nis widely used in the literature. For recent examples see Khoo and\nMandelkern (2019) and Charlow (2019).)\n\nNote: ways of restoring truth conditions, compatible with Supp\u2019s\nthesis, are considered in \u00a75.\n",
