    "main_text": "Theories of Mind || Persons: Reductionism and Supervenience\n5.6 Persons: Reductionism and Supervenience\n\n\nOne group of Buddhist philosophers, the Pudgalav\u0101dins (lit. \npersonalists), usually identified with the \nV\u0101ts\u012bputr\u012byas, seem to have advocated the view that \npersons can be said to conventionally exist, insofar as they are \nconceived in dependence upon the five aggregates and the six types of\ncognitive awareness (cf. Priestley 1999). The Pudgalav\u0101dins took\npersons to be as real as the collection of aggregates and regarded \nthem as neither identical nor different from the aggregates. Direct \naccounts of the Pudgalav\u0101da doctrine survive primarily in the \ncritiques of their opponents (and in three short texts preserved only\nin Chinese and in the \nSa\u1e43mit\u012byanik\u0101ya\u015b\u0101stra).\n\n\nVasubandhu offers what is perhaps the most detailed account of the \npersonalist theory in his Treasury of Higher Knowledge, \nalong with a refutation of the Brahmanical view of persons advocated \nby the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers. The relevant \nsection of the text, the Treatise on the Negation of the \nPerson (AKBh IX), begins with the standard warning that clinging\nto any substantive view of the self is detrimental to one's progress \ntoward liberation. Insofar as the notion of \u201cself\u201d or \n\u201cperson\u201d is retained this should not be taken to \ndesignate anything other than the aggregates.\n\n\nThe arguments that the Pudgalav\u0101dins advance in support of the \nreality of persons may be summarized as follows:\n\nPersons, which exist in dependence upon the aggregates, are real\njust like fire, which is conceived in dependence upon fuel, is\nreal.\nThe reality of persons is ascertained by means of perception or,\nmore specifically, by the apperception that accompanies each\napprehension of an object. That persons are real is demonstrated by\nmeans of an unexplainable perception, since persons are\nperceived.\nThings such as persons can be real without having a separate\nidentity, that is, without having either substantive existence or\nbeing conceptually established upon substantive entities (viz., the\naggregates).\nPersons exist ultimately insofar as they are dependent upon the\naggregates, which are ultimately real.\n\n\n\nIn introducing the views of the personalists, Vasubandhu draws a \ndistinction between the substantive and the conceptual view of the \nself. Thus, if \u2018person\u2019 (pudgala) is taken to \ndesignate a substantive entity that is separate from the bundle of \nthe five aggregates and unconditioned, then that cannot be the \nBuddhist view (per contra that is the Brahmanical view of \nthe self). On the other hand, if the notion of \u2018person\u2019 \ndesignates a collection of aggregates, then it is admissible to talk \nabout persons being conventionally real (for detailed discussions of \nVasubandhu's critique of the personalist view see Duerlinger 1993, \n2003). Drawing on some contemporary discussions in the philosophy of \nmind, Siderits (2003: 89\u201396) makes a good case for taking the \nPudgalav\u0101dins as proposing something analogous to the notion \nthat persons non-reductively supervene on the aggregates.\n",
