Russell\u2019s Error-Theoretic Wobble: There Is No Absolute Good\n\n\u201cIs There an Absolute Good?\u201d was apparently delivered on\nthe 14th of March 1922 at special meeting of the Apostles\n(RoE: 122\u2013124/Papers 9: 345\u2013346).\nRussell opens up in the fine, flippant style that the Apostles tended\nto admire:\n\n\nWhen the generation to which I belong were young, Moore persuaded us\nall that there is an absolute good. Most of us drew the inference that\nwe were absolutely good, but this is not an essential part of\nMoore\u2019s position, though it is one of its most attractive parts.\n\n\nBut he soon gets down to philosophical business in what must be one of\nthe pithiest meta-ethical papers on record (it is a mere 809 words\nlong). Moore is right, he says, in thinking that \u201cwhen we say a\nthing is good we do not merely mean that we have towards it a\ncertain feeling, of liking or approval or what not.\u201d Indeed\n\u201cethical judgments claim objectivity\u201d; that is, they\npurport to tell it like it is. However, this \u201cclaim [to]\nobjectivity \u2026 makes them all false\u201d. Since there is no\nproperty of goodness corresponding to the linguistic predicate\n\u201cgood\u201d, nothing can ever possess it. Hence, any claim that\nfriendship or anything else is good will be false, since\nthere is no such thing as goodness for friendship or pleasure to be.\nThe same goes for badness. Moreover, if there is no such thing as\ngoodness or badness, there is no such thing as rightness either, since\nfor an action to be genuinely right it must be such that it can\nreasonably be expected to produce more good and less bad than any\nalternative. But if there is no such thing as goodness to be produced,\nno action can be expected to produce more of it than any other. Of\ncourse, an action can still be relatively right: more likely\nto produce more of what somebody believes to be good and less\nof what somebody believes to be bad than any alternative. But\nno action can be genuinely right or genuinely\nobligatory, since there are no such properties as goodness or badness\nfor conscientious agents to maximize or minimize.\n\nThus far this is very like the error theory of J.L. Mackie (Mackie\n1946, 1977: ch. 1 and Joyce 2001). But there is a twist. For Mackie,\nas for Russell, \u201cgood\u201d is a meaningful predicate even\nthough there is no property corresponding to the word. But Mackie,\nunlike Russell, is unfazed by this fact. So far as Mackie is\nconcerned, meaningful predicates that refer to non-existent properties\npose no particular problems. But for Russell, we can only talk\nmeaningfully about non-existent things if they are defined in\nterms of things with which we are acquainted. This is a consequence of\nhis Fundamental Principle that\n\n\nevery proposition that we can understand must be composed wholly of\nconstituents with which we are acquainted (Mysticism and\nLogic: 209/Papers 6: 154)\n\n\nor, as he was later to put it,\n\n\nthat sentences we can understand must be composed of words with whose\nmeaning we are acquainted. (Schilpp (ed.) 1944: 692/Papers\n11: 27)\n\n\nAccording to Russell, it\n\n\nseems natural to infer, as Moore did, that, since propositions in\nwhich the word \u201cgood\u201d occurs have meaning, the word\n\u201cgood\u201d [itself] has [a] meaning.\n\n\nThis, however, is a \u201cfallacy\u201d. Even though\n\u201cgood\u201d can appear in meaningful sentences it does not have\na meaning of its own. This is very puzzling. What does Russell mean\nwhen he says that \u201cgood\u201d has no meaning? And why is\nMoore\u2019s view dependent on the thesis that it does?\n\nLet us start with Moore. As stated above\n (\u00a72.1),\n Moore\u2019s Open Question Argument goes like this:\n\n\u201cAre X things good?\u201d is a significant or open\nquestion for any naturalistic or metaphysical predicate\n\u201cX\u201d; (whether simple or complex).\nIf two expressions (whether simple or complex) are synonymous this\nis evident on reflection to every competent speaker.\nThe meaning of a predicate or property word is the property for\nwhich it stands. Thus if two predicates or property words have\ndistinct meanings they name distinct properties.\n\n\nFrom (1) and (2) it follows that\n\n\u201cGood\u201d is not synonymous with any naturalistic or\nmetaphysical predicate \u201cX\u201d (or\n\u201cgoodness\u201d with any corresponding noun or noun-phrase\n\u201cX-ness\u201d).\n\n\nFrom (3) and (4) it follows that\n\nGoodness is not identical with any natural or metaphysical\nproperty of X-ness.\n\n\nPremise (3) is crucial. Moore takes it for granted that the meaning of\na predicate is the property for which it stands. Hence, if there were\nno property of goodness corresponding to the word \u201cgood\u201d,\n\u201cgood\u201d would be meaningless. Since \u201cgood\u201d is\nquite obviously not meaningless, the corresponding property\nis guaranteed. Thus we move from an obvious semantic fact\u2014that\n\u201cgood\u201d is plainly meaningful\u2014to a much more\ncontentious metaphysical claim\u2014that there is a corresponding\nproperty of goodness. What greases the wheels of this transition is\nthe apparently innocuous assumption that if a word like\n\u201cgood\u201d is to mean something, there must be some\nthing (or at least some property) that it means. If this\ndoctrine were true, then the objections to objectivism discussed in\nthe last section would fall to the ground. The very fact that we can\ntalk meaningfully about goodness would show that there must\nindeed be such a property. It might be causally impotent and\nmetaphysically queer, but the fact that we can discuss it would entail\nthat we were stuck with it anyway.\n\nTo the end of his days Russell believed that\n\n\nthere are words which are only significant because there is something\nthat they mean, and if there were not this something, they would be\nempty noises not words. (Russell 1959: 177)\n\n\nBut when he was young he thought that most words were like\nthis, which explains the swollen ontology of The Principles of\nMathematics:\n\n\nHomeric gods, relations, chimeras and four-dimensional spaces all have\nbeing, for if they were not entities of a kind, we could make no\npropositions about them. (Russell, The Principles of\nMathematics: 449)\n\n\nThe breakthrough came with his Theory of Definite Descriptions (1905).\nPhrases such as \u201cthe present King of France\u201d are\nincomplete symbols, which can function meaningfully in the\ncontext of a sentence even though there may be nothing that they mean.\nThey are incomplete because they have no meaning when taken in\nisolation and in the context of a sentence can be analyzed away. When\n\u201cthe King of France is bald\u201d is analyzed in accordance\nwith Russell\u2019s formula\u2014\u201cThere is something which is King\nof France such that if anything is King of France, it is identical\nwith that thing, and that thing is bald\u201d\u2014the phrase\n\u201cthe King of France\u201d simply disappears, though we are left\nwith the predicate \u201cis King of France\u201d. \u201cThe King of\nFrance is bald\u201d, is false because there is no King of\nFrance\u2014nothing which satisfies the propositional function\nbeing king of France\u2014and there is no need to suppose\nthat the King of France must have some kind of being in order for this\nproposition to make sense.\n\nThis brings us back to the Open Question Argument. So far as I can\nsee, Russell continued to accept premises (1) and (2) and\nthus\u2014with reservations\u2014sub-conclusion (4).\n\u201cGood\u201d does not mean that same as any naturalistic\npredicate X\u2014at least, it does not mean the same as any of\nthe naturalistic predicates that have been suggested so far. But he\nalso accepts something like premise (3), that the meaning of a\npredicate is the property for which it stands. It was because he\nbelieved that some predicates were among the words \u201cwhich are\nonly significant because there is something that they mean\u201d, and\nwhich would be \u201cempty noises not words\u201d in the absence of\nthis something, that he continued to believe in properties, right up\nuntil 1959. How then can Russell fend off Moore\u2019s conclusion (5) that\nthere is a property of goodness that is not identical to any\nnaturalistic property of X-ness? By modifying premise (3):\n\n3\u2032.\nThe meaning of a predicate or property word is the property for\nwhich it stands, so long as that predicate is a complete\nsymbol.\n\n\nSome predicates are not complete symbols, and these can\nfunction meaningfully in the absence of the properties that they might\ndenote. One of these predicates is the word \u201cgood\u201d.\n\n\nWithout the theory of incomplete symbols, it seemed natural to infer,\nas Moore did, that, since propositions in which the word\n\u201cgood\u201d occurs have meaning, therefore the word\n\u201cgood\u201d has meaning [or as we might now say, a referent];\nbut this was a fallacy.\n\nMy point is that the word \u201cgood\u201d does not stand for a\npredicate [by which Russell means a property] at all, but has a\nmeaning only in the sense in which descriptive phrases have meaning,\ni.e., in use, not in isolation.\n\n\nThus \u201cgood\u201d can be meaningful in the absence of a property\nof goodness and the error theory is safe from semantic refutation.\n\nBut Russell is not quite out of the woods. He continued to believe in\nhis Fundamental Principle that to understand a proposition we must be\nacquainted with the referents of the words that remain once the\nproposition has been boiled down to its ultimate constituents. This\nmeans, in effect, that things which don\u2019t exist have to be defined in\nterms of things which do, indeed, that things which don\u2019t\nexist have to be defined terms of things (including universals) with\nwhich we are acquainted. How then is \u201cgood\u201d to be\ndefined? More pedantically, how are sentences involving\n\u201cgood\u201d to be analyzed so that the word \u201cgood\u201d\ncan be eliminated? According to Russell,\n\n\nwhen we judge \u201cM is good\u201d, we mean: \u201cM\nhas that predicate [property] which is common to A, B,\nC, \u2026[the things we approve of] but is absent in\nX, Y, Z, \u2026[the things we disapprove\nof].\u201d\n\n\nThe emotions of approval and disapproval, Russell notes,\n\n\ndo not enter into the meaning of the proposition \u201cM is\ngood\u201d, but only into its genesis.\n\n\nThat is, \u201cgood\u201d is defined in terms of the things that we\napprove (and disapprove) of, even though the fact that we approve (or\ndisapprove) of them is not incorporated into the analysis. Now, in\nRussell\u2019s opinion, the proposition\n\n\nM has that property which is common to A, B,\nC, \u2026 [the things we approve of] but is absent in\nX, Y, Z, \u2026 [the things we disapprove\nof],\n\n\nwill be always be false since the things we approve of have nothing in\ncommon apart from the fact that we approve of them. That is why\n\u201call propositions in which the word \u2018good\u2019\nhas a primary occurrence are false.\u201d But will such propositions\nin fact be false? Surely X, Y, Z,\netc. do have a property in common, namely the property\nof being X or Y or Z or \u2026! Perhaps Russell would reply\nthat disjunctive properties are not real properties. He took a dim\nview of disjunctive facts in\nThe Philosophy of Logical Atomism, and if disjunctive\nfacts should be rejected, then disjunctive properties would\nappear to be equally suspect (Papers 8: 185\u20136/The\nPhilosophy of Logical Atomism: 71\u201372). Even so, we cannot\nbe sure that in every case the things that we approve of\ndon\u2019t have something in common other than a) the fact that we approve\nof them and b) that they satisfy a disjunctive predicate. Nor is this\nthe only problem. Though Russell defines \u201cgood\u201d in terms\nof the things that \u201cwe\u201d approve (and disapprove)\nof, what he seems to mean is that each person defines\n\u201cgood\u201d in terms of the things that he or she\napproves (or disapproves) of. Thus if you and I approve of different\nthings, when I say \u201cM is good\u201d and you say\n\u201cM is not good\u201d what I mean is that M has\nthe property shared by X, Y, Z \u2026\n[the things that I approve of] whereas what you mean\nis that is that it does not have the property shared by\nA, B, C \u2026 [the things that\nyou approve of]. But in that case the Problem of the\nDisappearing Dispute rears its ugly head. On Russell\u2019s theory my\n\u201cM is good\u201d and your \u201cM is not\ngood\u201d may be quite consistent. But since they are obviously\nnot consistent, there must be something wrong with Russell\u2019s\ntheory. We can put the point by paraphrasing Russell\u2019s own criticisms\nof simple subjectivism:\n\n\nIf in asserting that A is good, [a person] X meant\nmerely to assert that A had a certain relation to himself such\nas pleasing his taste in some way [or that A had a\ncharacteristic shared by the things of which he approved] and\nY, in saying that A is not good, meant merely to deny\nthat A had a like relation to himself [or to deny that A\nhad the characteristic shared by the things of which he, Y,\napproved]; then there would be no subject of debate between them.\n(Philosophical Essays: 20\u201321/Papers 6:\n222)\n\n\nNor is this all. As we saw in\n \u00a78.1,\n our moral sentiments are partly constituted by our moral beliefs.\nWhat distinguishes approval from a warm feeling of liking is not some\ndifference in phenomenological flavor but the thought that the thing\nwe approve of is good or right. Our moral sentiments are feelings\nthat, where what follows the \u201cthat\u201d is a moral\njudgment. But if we can\u2019t have feelings of approval or disapproval\nwithout the corresponding moral beliefs, we can\u2019t explain the\nintellectual origins of the common conceptions of goodness and badness\nin terms of pre-existing sentiments of approval or disapproval. For\nprior to these conceptions there were no such sentiments. This is not\nthe criticism that sank the emotivist theories of Ayer and Stevenson.\nThe problem is not that Russell\u2019s analysis of\n\u201cgood\u201d is viciously circular because it presupposes the\nvery concept that it purports to explicate. The problem is\nthat his genealogy of \u201cgood\u201d is viciously\ncircular (and therefore false) since it presupposes the concept it\npurports to explain. For in his capacity as an error-theorist\nRussell does not define \u201cgood\u201d and\n\u201cbad\u201d in terms of approval and disapproval. Rather he\ngives a genealogy of these notions in which the feelings of\napproval and disapproval play a crucial part. As he himself puts it:\n\u201cthe emotions of approval and disapproval do not enter into the\nmeaning of the proposition \u2018M is good\u2019, but only\ninto its genesis\u201d. But our concepts of \u201cgood\u201d and\n\u201cbad\u201d cannot be caused by prior feelings of approval and\ndisapproval if those feelings are partly constituted by the very\nbeliefs they are supposed to cause. My belief that M is good\ncannot be caused by tendency to approve of M, if I cannot\napprove of M without believing that M is good.\n\nHowever, the real difficulty with Russell\u2019s error theory and the one\nwhich probably weighed with Russell himself, seems to be this. Given\nRussell\u2019s theory of meaning, he can make sense of non-existent\nproperties but not non-natural predicates. At least, he cannot make\nsense of predicates that are not definable in terms of things with\nwhich we are acquainted. Thus on the assumption that we are not\nacquainted with goodness (which we obviously cannot be if there is\nreally no such thing), and on the assumption that \u201cgood\u201d\ncannot defined in terms of the things with which we are\nacquainted (which seems pretty plausible if is not equivalent to any\nnaturalistic predicate) then we cannot even understand the\npredicate \u201cgood\u201d. At least, we cannot understand it, if it\nis construed as a descriptive predicate whose function it is to denote\na property (whether real or non-existent).\n\nAfter 1922, Russell abandoned the error theory and reverted to the\nemotivism that he had been flirting with since 1913. His reasons\nremain obscure. But perhaps it had something to do with the fact that\nhis Fundamental Principle, when combined with the OQA, made it\ndifficult, if not impossible, to make sense of \u201cgood\u201d as\nstanding for a property that is both non-existent\nand non-natural. Since he retained his faith in the\nFundamental Principle he had to give up the error theory. And since he\nhad already rejected the objectivity of ethics\u2014what we would\nnowadays describe as moral realism\u2014this left him no alternative\nbut some form of non-cognitivsm. In my opinion this was the wrong\nchoice. He would have done better to give up the Fundamental Principle\nand stick with the error theory. But perhaps the thesis that moral\njudgments are mostly false was a bit too much for a dedicated moralist\nsuch as he. As he wrote to his brother, he would rather \u201cbe mad\nwith truth than sane with lies\u201d and the idea that morality was\nlargely composed of lies\u2014or a best useful fictions\u2014would\nhave been too much to bear (see Pigden (ed.) 1999: 20, 121\u2013122,\n& 189\u2013193).\n",
