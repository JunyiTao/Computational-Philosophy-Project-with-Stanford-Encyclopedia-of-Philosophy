    "main_text": "Later Developments in Antiquity\n8. Influence\n\nIt is an undeniable fact, although nowadays rarely acknowledged, that\nthe general outlook and the principal doctrines of the Neoplatonists\nproved exceedingly influential throughout the entire history of\nwestern philosophy. Through Augustine (354\u2013430) in the West and\nthe 4th-century Cappadocian Fathers (Basil, Gregory of\nNyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus) in the East as well as the\npseudo-epigraphic writings of Dionysius the Areopagite (early\n6th century), Neoplatonism profoundly influenced the\nemergence of mainstream and not so mainstream Christian theology (John\nScotus Eriugena, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, Meister Eckhart). In\naddition, by way of a pseudo-epigraphical treatise\nentitled Theology of Aristotle, Neoplatonic thought\nfacilitated the integration of ancient philosophy and science into\nboth Islam (especially through Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi and Avicenna [Ibn\nSina]) and Judaism (Maimonides).\n\nDuring the Renaissance, ancient Greek learning, and Neoplatonism in\nparticular, experienced a dramatic revival in the West in the wake of\nthe work of Gemistus Plethon (1355\u20131452), Bessarion\n(1403\u20131472) and, above all, Marsilio Ficino (1433\u20131499),\nwhose translation and interpretation of Plato and Plotinus in the\nsecond half of the 15th century influenced not only the\nphilosophy, but also the art and literature of the period. It may even\nbe true to say that even more than the writings of Plato and Aristotle\nthemselves Neoplatonic ideas have continued to influence Western\nthinkers of the idealist persuasion, such as the Cambridge Platonists\n(who were really Neoplatonists), Leibniz, Hegel, Schelling, Fichte,\nBergson and Teilhard de Chardin, to name but a few.\nThe history of Neoplatonism until the present day is much too\ndiverse and complex to be done justice to in an introductory article\nsuch as this. In spite of the ubiquity of proponents of this developed\nform of Platonism in all historical periods of western philosophy\nsince late antiquity, today Neoplatonism has acquired the reputation\nof being speculative and abstract to a fault. Modern philosophical\ncommitments to empiricism, logical positivism, and the analysis of\nlanguage have not helped much to arrive at a judicious evaluation of\nthe movement, its strengths and its weaknesses, and the dramatic\nscientific discoveries of contemporary bottom-up materialism tend to\ndeter students from even attempting to find their way into the world\nof Neoplatonism. Perhaps another reason that this kind of thinking\nstrikes the general public as arcane and alien may be that the Abrahamic\nreligions, even if they too posit a single divine principle as the\nsource of all being, conceive of this principle as a person and maker.\nThis vestige of pre-philosophical anthropomorphism bypasses the\ndifficult questions that the last pagan thinkers so arduously\nstruggled to answer when they sought to explain the existence of the\ndiverse and complex physical world from a non-material principle that\nthey assumed to be nothing but One.\n",
