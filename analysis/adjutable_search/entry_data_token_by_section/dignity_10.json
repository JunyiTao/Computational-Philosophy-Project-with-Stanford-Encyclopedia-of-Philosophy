    "main_text": "Human Dignity: Touchstones of Analysis || Inherent vs. constructed\n3.3 Inherent vs. constructed\n\nIt is common to talk of human dignity as \u201cinherent\u201d. What\nthis means, however, is often unclear. Sometimes it is redescribed to\nmean \u201cintrinsic\u201d, other times \u201cinalienable\u201d.\nIt is also often conjoined with claims that dignity is\n\u201cinviolable\u201d\u2014although this is dubious if\ninviolability is supposed to be entailed by inherentness.\nAfter all, one might agree that human dignity cannot be entirely\ndestroyed because dignity is inherent, but nevertheless allow that\nhuman dignity can be harmed, insulted, frustrated, and humiliated.\n\nThis is not to suggest that all that is inherent is indestructible.\nWhether human dignity can really be destroyed depends entirely on why\none thinks human dignity is inherent. If one thinks that human dignity\nis inherent because we have dignity in virtue of possessing a soul,\nthen they probably do not think dignity can be truly destroyed\n(although they may think it can be degraded; or even, if they\nsubscribe to Christian dogma, that it was in fact degraded by the\n\u201cfall\u201d from grace). On the other hand, if one thinks that\nhuman dignity is inherent because we have dignity in virtue of our\ncapacities for rational agency, then they probably do think dignity\ncan be lost or destroyed, whether by extreme psychological trauma or a\nsharp blow to the head.\n\nIt must also be reiterated that secular theorists of dignity have\nincreasingly turned away from \u201cinherentness\u201d as a defining\nproperty of dignity (see, e.g., Darwall 2006; Debes 2009; Kateb 2011;\nRosen 2012a; Waldron 2012; Valentini 2017; Killmister 2020). The\nreasons for doing so vary. Most reflect suspicion about the\nmetaphysical baggage, especially of the theological kind, that\nhistorically has gone hand in hand with inherentness claims. But there\nare often other reasons. For example, for those that think human\ndignity is defined by the authority or standing to hold others\nresponsible with second-personal claims, dignity only comes into\nexistence within actual second-personal encounters (see, e.g., Meyer\n1989, Darwall 2006, Forst 2011, and perhaps Feinberg 1970 [1980]). Or\nrecall Valentini, who argues that the problem with the metaphysical\nclaims needed to back up inherentness is not simply that they are\n\u201cheavy\u201d, but that they distract us from the core political\nfunction of rights. Meanwhile, for those committed to a negative\nmethodology, like Killmister or Etinson, the starting assumption is\nthat dignity can be destroyed. And while this does not entail\nthat dignity is not inherent, Killmister persuasively argues that such\nfragility strongly tells against inherentness.\n\nAll this raises the question: If not inherent, then what? The simple\nanswer is that on many theories dignity is socially constructed. Of\ncourse, there are many theories about what it means for something to\nbe socially constructed, with many important differences between them.\nThere is, for example, a chasm of difference between claiming that\ndignity is constructed as a constitutive part of second-personal\nrelationships (\u00e0 la Darwall or Forst) and claiming\nthat it is constructed through the transformation of an old idea about\n\u201celevated rank\u201d (\u00e0 la Appiah or Waldron).\nSo, the simple answer must be turned into a complicated one, which we\ncannot do here.\n",
