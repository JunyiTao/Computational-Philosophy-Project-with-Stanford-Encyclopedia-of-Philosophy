Cloning for Research and Therapy\n\nCloning for research and therapy involves the creation of an embryo\nvia SCNT, but instead of transferring the cloned embryo to the uterus\nin order to generate a pregnancy, it is used to obtain pluripotent\nstem cells. It is thus not the intention to use the embryo for\nreproductive purposes. Embryonic stem cells offer powerful tools for\ndeveloping therapies for currently incurable diseases and conditions,\nfor important biomedical research, and for drug discovery and toxicity\ntesting (Cervera & Stojkovic 2007). For example, one therapeutic\napproach is to induce embryonic stem cells to differentiate into\ncardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells) to repair or replace damaged heart\ntissue, into insulin-producing cells to treat diabetes, or into\nneurons and their supporting tissues to repair spinal cord\ninjuries.\n\nA potential problem with embryonic stem cells is that they will\nnormally not be genetically identical to the patient.\nEmbryonic stem cells are typically derived from embryos donated for\nresearch after in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment.\nBecause these stem cells would have a genetic identity different from\nthat of the recipient \u2013 the patient \u2013 they may, when used\nin therapy, be rejected by her immune system. Immunorejection can\noccur when the recipient\u2019s body does not recognize the\ntransplanted cells, tissues or organs as its own and as a defense\nmechanism attempts to destroy the graft. Another type of\nimmunorejection involves a condition called graft-versus-host disease,\nin which immune cells contaminating the graft recognize the new host\n\u2013 the patient \u2013 as foreign and attack the host\u2019s\ntissues and organs. Both types of immunorejection can result in loss\nof the graft or death of the patient. It is one of the most serious\nproblems faced in transplant surgery.\n\nCloning for research and therapy could potentially offer a solution to\nthis problem. An embryo produced via SNCT using the patient\u2019s\nsomatic cell as a donor cell would be virtually genetically identical\nto the patient. Stem cells obtained from that embryo would thus also\nbe genetically identical to the patient, as would be their\nderivatives, and would be less likely to be rejected after\ntransplantation. Though therapies using embryonic stem cells from SCNT\nembryos are not yet on the horizon for humans, scientists have\nprovided proof of concept for these therapies in the mouse.\n\nEmbryonic stem cells from cloned embryos would also have significant\nadvantages for biomedical research, and for drug discovery and\ntoxicity testing. Embryonic stem cells genetically identical to the\npatient could provide valuable in vitro models to study\ndisease, especially where animal models are not available, where the\nresearch cannot be done in patients themselves because it would be too\ninvasive, or where there are too few patients to work with (as in the\ncase of rare genetic diseases). Researchers could, for example, create\nlarge numbers of embryonic stem cells genetically identical to the\npatient and then experiment on these in order to understand the\nparticular features of the disease in that person. The embryonic stem\ncells and their derivatives could also be used to test potential\ntreatments. They could, for example, be used to test candidate drug\ntherapies to predict their likely toxicity. This would avoid dangerous\nexposure of patients to sometimes highly experimental drugs.\n\nCloning for research and therapy is, however, still in its infancy\nstages. In 2011, a team of scientists from the New York Stem Cell\nFoundation Laboratory was the first to have succeeded in creating two\nembryonic stem cell lines from human embryos produced through SCNT\n(Noggle et al. 2011). Three years earlier, a small San Diego\nbiotechnological company created human embryos (at the blastocyst\nstage) via SCNT but did not succeed in deriving embryonic stem cells\nfrom these cells (French et al. 2008). Cloning for research and\ntherapy is thus not likely to bear fruit in the short term though\nprogress is made (Tachibana et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2020). Apart\nfrom unsolved technical difficulties, much more basic research in\nembryonic stem cell research is needed. The term \u2018therapeutic\ncloning\u2019 has been criticized precisely for this reason. It\nsuggests that therapy using embryonic stem cells from cloned embryos\nis already reality. In the phase before clinical trials, critics say,\nit is only reasonable to refer to research on nuclear transfer as\n\u2018research cloning\u2019 or \u2018cloning for biomedical\nresearch\u2019 (PCBE, 2002).\n\nCloning for research and therapy holds great potential for future\nresearch and therapeutic applications, but it also raises various\nethical concerns.\n",
