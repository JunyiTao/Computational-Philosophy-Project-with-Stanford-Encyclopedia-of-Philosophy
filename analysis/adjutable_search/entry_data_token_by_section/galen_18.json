    "main_text": "Philosophy of Mind || Model(s) of the psuch\u0113\n7.1 Model(s) of the psuch\u0113\nGalen is strongly Platonist in central areas of his thought; this applies in particular to his moral psychology, where he adopts the Platonic division of the soul into rational and non-rational parts, the latter being further divided into the spirited (thumoeides) and the desiderative (epithum\u0113tikon). This fundamental rational/non-rational distinction, and the further one between the two non-rational parts, are for Galen essential to a correct conceptualization of the soul and its internal workings, and in particular to a correct approach to ethics (see further \u00a78 below).\nYet Platonic tripartition is also central to Galen\u2019s physiology of the whole body. The three parts\u2014rational, spirited, desiderative\u2014correspond to and are located in, respectively, the brain, the heart and the liver. These are the central organs in Galen\u2019s physiology, responsible respectively for: rational thought, perception and voluntary motion; involuntary motions (especially pulse and respiration) necessary to the maintenance of life; and blood-production and nutrition. Galen\u2019s adaptation of the Platonic tripartite soul theory is strikingly original and intellectually ambitious. (He finds explicit textual justification for these bodily locations of the soul parts in a passage from Plato\u2019s Timaeus\u2014although that text is primarily concerned to give an ethically normative account of the internal balance of the soul, not to advance a serious or detailed physiology.)\nWe might thus think that, according to this scheme, the psuch\u0113 properly belongs within just one part of the \u201ctripartite soul\u201d, that located in the brain; and indeed Galen does also (especially in anatomical-physiological contexts) use psuch\u0113 and its cognates in this narrower sense to refer to the brain and its functions.\nThere may seem to be a problematic relationship between the tripartite soul as it is discussed in Galen\u2019s specific ethical works, in particular Aff. Pecc. Dig., and this physiological conception (e.g., in PHP). The former ethical discussions give no significant account of a bodily aspect to psychic function, while in the latter context certain features central to that ethical account are absent or recede. The internal interrelation of the parts, so essential to the ethical account (see below) is not only absent from the physiological account; it is quite difficult to see how it could be mapped onto it.\nThe Greek psuch\u0113 is a broader concept than can be equated with either \u201cmind\u201d or \u201csoul\u201d: it is the vital principle\u2014that the presence of which accounts for life in the body\u2014as well as more specifically the locus of thought and moral activity. All vital activities, in this sense, can be defined as \u201cof the psuch\u0113\u201d, which is thus responsible for both (in our terms) mental and physical function. The h\u0113gemonikon is responsible for intellectual activity and memory, for voluntary motion and for perception; and each of these is also to be understood in terms of brain and/or nerve function. It is tempting, in view of the correlations that Galen explores, both between the functioning of the rational soul and states of the brain, and between emotional disturbances and states or activities of the heart and blood, to see him as advancing either some form of dual aspect theory or, indeed, a mind\u2013body identity theory. It seems clear, however, that Galen does not in any clear or consistent way elaborate such a clear or unified scheme (see further \u00a77.2).\nIt is important to understand the anatomical-medical, as opposed to narrowly philosophical, background here. Galen\u2019s theory is heavily influenced by the work of the Hellenistic medical authors Herophilus and Erasistratus (fourth\u2013third century BCE). This crucially included the discovery of the nervous system, as well as some detailed knowledge and theorization of the anatomy and functions of the brain (all, of course, quite unknown to Plato, with whose theory Galen attempts to harmonize them); see von Staden 2000. Galen\u2019s conception of brain, heart and liver as \u201csources\u201d (archai) of the three Platonic parts of the soul is inextricably linked with his anatomical understanding of the three sets of channels (nerves, arteries, veins) through which they operate.\nIt is also significant that Galen equates Plato\u2019s logistikon (\u201crational\u201d) with the h\u0113gemonikon (\u201cleading-part\u201d): the concepts are (in origin at least) distinct and derive from different conceptions of the soul. The latter is a Stoic term, although probably also prominent in the Hellenistic medical authors just mentioned: it is the notion of a single \u201ccommand centre\u201d for the soul, which communicates to the rest of the body, both receiving the information of the different sense organs and giving the command (in Stoic language, the assent) for voluntary actions. Such a single command centre is not (at least explicitly) present in Plato; similarly, such a physically centralized psychic concept is at best vaguely present in Aristotle.\nGalen is centrally concerned to refute the Stoic view of the h\u0113gemonikon as located in the heart, as against the Platonic-Galenic view of its location in the brain. In the process, while asserting his allegiance to Platonic thought on the soul, it is at least arguable that he adopts a unitary view of the soul and its \u201ccommand centre\u201d which is conceptually much closer to the Stoic one (on this point see Gill 2010).\n",
