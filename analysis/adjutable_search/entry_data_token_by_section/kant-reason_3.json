    "main_text": "Theoretical reason: reason\u2019s cognitive role and limitations || The limits of reason\n1.3 The limits of reason\n\nThis is the best-known point, and is considered in detail in the entry\non\n Kant\u2019s critique of metaphysics.\n Kant demolishes a series of supposed proofs of the existence of God\n(\u201cThe Ideal of Pure Reason\u201d) and the soul (\u201cThe\nParalogisms\u201d).\n\nHe also demonstrates that it is equally possible to prove some\njudgments about \u201cworld wholes\u201d as it is to prove their\nopposites. \u201cThe Antinomies\u201d contain arguments that space\nmust be unbounded and that it must be bounded, that there\nmust be an absolutely first cause and that there cannot be\n(the problem of freedom in the famous \u201cThird\nAntinomy\u201d).\n\nThese sections have always been regarded as the most convincing parts\nof the book. Mendelssohn spoke for many of Kant\u2019s contemporaries\nin calling him the \u201call-destroyer.\u201d These contradictions\nshow the limits of metaphysical knowledge.\n\nKant\u2019s intentions are not destructive, however. Philosophers\nmust understand the capacity that they rely on\u2014that is,\nreason\n (\u00a71.4).\n Theologians and metaphysicians have often claimed knowledge that\nreason cannot deliver. This has led to empty battles that invite\nskepticism about reason. After all, if reasoning leads to inconsistent\nclaims, how can we rely on it? By contrast, Kant aims to clear the\nground: reason has limits but it is not powerless; philosophical\nreasoning can justify some claims. These include the claims\ndiscussed above\n (\u00a71.1\n and\n \u00a71.2)\n as well as reason\u2019s practical role\n (\u00a72\n below). Gava & Willaschek (forthcoming)\u00a0usefully stress this\naspect of the first Critique.\n\nIn the Doctrine of Method (the last, least-read part of the first\nCritique) Kant refers to the biblical story of Babel\n(Genesis, Ch. 11). The literal meaning of \u201cBabel\u201d\nis \u201cconfusion\u201d\u2014God punished human beings\u2019\nattempt to build \u201ca tower that would reach the heavens\u201d\n(A707/B735) by giving them many different languages. Since they were\nunable to understand one another, they could no longer cooperate in\nsuch hubristic\n ventures.[10]\n Again and again, reason returns to some simple ideas with towering\nimplications\u2014the immortal soul, God, freedom. Worse, it cooks\n up[11]\n more or less convincing proofs of these.\n\nSince these ideas reach beyond experience of a shared world, people\nlack a shared way to test them. Perhaps they emptily repeat other\npeople\u2019s words without real understanding; quite possibly, they\ncome up with conflicting versions of these ideas. They talk past one\nanother; they might as well speak different languages. Most likely,\nthey will fall into conflict, or find peace only by submitting to an\nunreasoned authority. In metaphysics, Kant refers to \u201cthe\nridiculous despotism of the schools\u201d\n (Bxxxv).[12]\n In practical life, however, despotism is far from ridiculous: it is\nthe brutal last resort for securing order when people adopt\nconflicting ideas and pursue conflicting goals. Kant often alludes to\nHobbes, who holds that peace is only possible if an unaccountable\nsovereign \u201coverawes\u201d every member of\n society.[13]\n On many interpretations, Kantian reason aims to build intersubjective\norder and avoid the dangers of Babel-like hubris, conflict and\ndespotism (Saner 1967, O\u2019Neill 1989, Neiman 1994).\n\nIn the Preface to the second edition of the Critique, Kant\nmakes a famous claim: \u201cI had to deny knowledge in order\nto make room for faith\u201d (Bxxx). Human beings cannot\nhave knowledge of the world as a whole. They cannot know entities that\ntranscend this world, such as the immortal soul or God. We cannot\nexperience these things through our senses; reason cannot supply such\nknowledge. However, Kant argues that knowledge is not the\nprimary end of reason. Only our role within the world\n\u201cnecessarily interests everyone\u201d (A839n/B867n). Kant\nrejects a \u201cscholastic\u201d or knowledge-oriented notion of\nphilosophy. Instead, he offers a \u201ccosmic\u201d or\nworld-oriented one (A838/B866; cf. Ypi 2021: Ch. 1 and Ferrarin\n2015).\n\nKant proposes three questions that answer \u201call the interest of\nmy reason\u201d: \u201cWhat can I know?\u201d \u201cWhat must I\ndo?\u201d and \u201cWhat may I hope?\u201d (A805/B833). We have\nseen his answer to the first question: we can only know the world as\nrevealed through the senses. Kant does not answer the second question\nuntil the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, four years\nlater. (Arguably, he sees no need to answer the question in this form,\nsince he is confident that people have long known how they ought to\n act.[14])\n But the first Critique does include some observations on\nhope\u2014that is, faith in God and a future world. Kant argues that\nknowledge of these things is not only impossible\u2014it would also\ncorrupt practical reasoning. Rather than doing good for its own sake,\nwe would be motivated by external incentives\u2014eternal punishment\nand heavenly reward. Kant later calls this \u201cheteronomy,\u201d\nas opposed to \u201cautonomy\u201d\u2014our own personal commitment\nto morality. Despite this, Kant argues that we have legitimate reasons\nto hope for God and immortality. We must also have confidence in our\nfreedom to act morally. He connects and develops these claims in the\nsecond Critique, as discussed below\n (\u00a72.3).\n\nSince \u201creason\u201d is a mental capacity, it may seem strange\nto speak of it having \u201cneeds\u201d or \u201cinterests.\u201d\nThe basic idea is that there are preconditions for successfully\nexercising this capacity. For finite human beings, reason is not\ntransparent or infallible, as some rationalist philosophers seemed to\nthink. We may think we are reasoning, when actually we are\ncooking up false rationalizations and self-deceptions. We may think we\nare reasoning well, when we argue toward transcendent truths,\nsuch as the existence of God or a future world. So reason has an\n\u201cinterest\u201d in appreciating its own limits, if it is to be\nvalid. As Kleingeld puts it, reason \u201cneeds to present itself to\nitself in the process of gaining clarity about its own workings\u201d\n(1998a: 97)\u2014above all, the principles that it must give to\nitself. As the next section discusses, this means that Kant views\nreason as essentially self-reflexive.\n",
