    "main_text": "Overcoming Dualism || Logical Meaning of Not Two\n5.1 Logical Meaning of Not Two\n\nLogically speaking, Zen explains that \u201ctwo\u201d things arise\nbecause the everyday standpoint stipulates the above-mention\nepistemological paradigm as the standard for cognizing the whole,\nhowever the whole may be construed (Nagatomo, 2000, 213\u201344).\nThis logic thinks it reasonable to divide the whole into two parts\nwhen knowing or understanding reality. That is, when this logic is\napplied to the whole, it compels the user of this logic to choose,\nreasonably in the mind of the user, one part, while disregarding the\nother part(s) as irrelevant or meaningless. It prioritizes one part\nat the expense of the other part(s), while celebrating the\nexclusion. In so doing, it looks to the explicit while\nbecoming oblivious to the fact that the implicit equally exists as a\nsupporting ground for the explicit, where the explicit is\nsomething \u201cobvious\u201d to the senses and the rational mind.\nIt champions one-sidedness in cognition and judgment as the supreme\nform of knowing and understanding reality. However, Zen thinks that\nthis prioritization, this exclusion, violates a cardinal principle of\nknowing, for knowledge of anything demands an understanding of the\nwhole. Either-or logic fails on this account. Moreover, it contends\nthat when this logic attempts to understand the whole, it\ntheoretically reduces the other to the one that is judged to\nbe true and/or real. For example, if one maintains that the mind is\nreal, one disregards the body as unreal, yielding an idealist\nposition. On the other hand, if one thinks the body is real, it\ndisposes of the mind in the same way, favoring materialism as true and\nreal, which is presupposed, for example, by natural science. Either\nposition commits itself to reductionism. Here, questioning this\npractice and the consequences it entails, Zen instead speaks of\nmind-body oneness, an holistic perspective, as it abhors\none-sidedness. However, it warns that as soon as \u201cone\u201d is\ncontrasted with \u201ctwo\u201d in a discourse, it is no longer\ngenuine and authentic, because once it is objectified linguistically\nor reflectively, it slips into being an idea, an abstraction.\n",
