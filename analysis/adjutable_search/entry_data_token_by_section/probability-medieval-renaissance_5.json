What frequently or usually\nhappened was prima facie considered to be probable. Scholastic usage\nof frequency terms followed ancient precedent, most notably\nAristotle\u2019s statements of what is true or false \u201cin most\ncases\u201d (h\u014ds epi to polu). Whether this background\nin Aristotelian science and methodology justifies the assumption of a\nmedieval frequency concept of probability will be discussed in Section\n3.2.\n",
