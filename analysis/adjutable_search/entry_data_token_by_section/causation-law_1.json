    "main_text": "The Law\u2019s Explicit Definition of Causation || The dominant two-tier definition of causation in the law\n2.1 The dominant two-tier definition of causation in the law\n\nThe conventional wisdom about the causation requirement in both\ncriminal law and torts is that it in reality consists of two very\ndifferent requirements for liability. The first requirement is that of\n\u201ccause in fact\u201d. Such conventional wisdom holds that the\n\u201ccause-in-fact\u201d requirement is the only truly\ncausal component of the law\u2019s two requirements (despite\nthe fact that both are framed in causal terms), because this doctrine\nis the only one that corresponds with any scientific or even factual\nnotion of causation. Whether cigarette smoking causes cancer, whether\nthe presence of hydrogen or helium caused an explosion, are factual\nquestions to be resolved by the best science the courts can muster,\nand these are classed as \u201ccause-in-fact\u201d questions. By\ncontrast, it is contested whether the second requirement, that of\n\u201cproximate\u201d or \u201clegal\u201d cause, is an evaluative\nissue, to be resolved by arguments of policy, or whether it too is a\nmatter of causal fact. Suppose a defendant knifes his victim, who then\ndies because her religious convictions are such that she refuses\nmedical treatment while knowing that such refusal will kill her\n(Regina v. Blaue). Has such a defendant (legally) caused her\ndeath? The doctrines of proximate cause are used to resolve such\nquestions, it being controversial whether such resolutions are matters\nof natural fact or of moral fact (\u201cpolicy\u201d).\n",
