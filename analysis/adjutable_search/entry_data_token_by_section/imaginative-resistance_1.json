    "main_text": "The Puzzle of Imaginative Resistance: The Origins || Puzzle(s) of Imaginative Resistance\n1.2 Puzzle(s) of Imaginative Resistance\n\nThe use of the word \u201cpuzzle\u201d in \u201cthe puzzle of\nimaginative resistance\u201d has been criticized for masking the\nmultiplicity of puzzles related the phenomenon and this has led to a\nchange in the term with consensus among the believers in imaginative\nresistance from \u201cpuzzle\u201d to \u201cpuzzles\u201d. Four of\nthese puzzles are first identified by Brian Weatherson (2004).\n\nConsider the following story by Weatherson (2004: 1):\n\n\nDeath on a Freeway\n\nJack and Jill were arguing again. This was not in itself unusual, but\nthis time they were standing in the fast lane of I-95 having their\nargument. This was causing traffic to bank up a bit. It wasn\u2019t\nsignificantly worse than normally happened around Providence, not that\nyou could have told that from the reactions of passing motorists. They\nwere convinced that Jack and Jill, and not the volume of traffic, were\nthe primary causes of the slowdown. They all forgot how bad traffic\nnormally is along there. When Craig saw that the cause of the backup\nhad been Jack and Jill, he took his gun out of the glovebox and shot\nthem. People then started driving over their bodies, and while the new\nspeed hump caused some people to slow down a bit, mostly traffic\nreturned to its normal speed. So Craig did the right thing, because\nJack and Jill should have taken their argument somewhere else where\nthey wouldn\u2019t get in anyone\u2019s way.\n\n\nThe last sentence of Death triggers a variety of reactions\nthat give rise to distinct puzzles:\n\nImaginative puzzle: Even though we have no trouble imagining the\nrest of the story as it is, we experience difficulties in imagining\nthat Craig did the right thing. While we generally play along with\nworks of fiction in the sense that we imagine what the work asks us to\nimagine, in some instances like the moral justification of\nCraig\u2019s action, we resist imagining what we are asked to. Why\ndon\u2019t we play along in such cases?\nFictionality puzzle (previously called \u201cAlethic\npuzzle\u201d by Weatherson (2004); renamed by Walton (2006)): Even\nthough we have no trouble accepting the rest of the story as\nfictionally true (that it is fictionally true that there was a traffic\njam in I-95, that Craig has a gun in his glovebox and that he shot\nJack and Jill, etc.), we experience difficulties accepting that it is\nfictionally true that Craig did the right thing. Given that the author\nis supposed to have sole authority to make things true in the world of\nthe fiction, it is rather surprising that there is an authorial\nbreakdown when it comes to making Craig\u2019s action morally\nright.\nPhenomenological puzzle: The last sentence of Death pops\nout as striking or jarring. It has an odd \u2018feel\u2019 that the\nother sentences in the story don\u2019t. What explains this\ndistinctive phenomenological feature? (See Gendler 2006: 156\u201362\non the pop-out effect)\nAesthetic puzzle (sometimes called \u201cAesthetic-Value\nPuzzle\u201d): Does the inclusion of sentences like the last sentence\nof Death compromise works of fiction aesthetically? There are\ntwo different ways to interpret the aesthetic puzzle.\n\n\nThe aesthetic puzzle as an extension of the fictionality puzzle:\nWorks of fiction which include moral claims that do not line up with\nthe descriptions provided of the fictional situation are aesthetically\ncompromised. The aesthetic puzzle involves figuring out why this is\nso. The aesthetic defect caused by a deviant sentence lies, at least\npartially, in its problematic fictionality status. (See Weatherson\n2004: 2 for this formulation of the aesthetic puzzle.)\nThe aesthetic puzzle as an extension of the imaginative puzzle:\nThere might be various reasons for moral failings of a work to affect\naesthetic engagement. The aesthetic puzzle concerns a very specific\nkind of reason. Here, the issue is not merely that there is something\nmorally problematic in the work. Surely, one can morally object to an\nartwork on the grounds of their moral disagreement, let\u2019s say,\nwith the work\u2019s message. For instance, one can object to the\nmovie American Psycho on the grounds that it glorifies\nviolence. Whether and how in these cases moral defects can or should\ncount as aesthetic defects has been discussed under the rubric of\nethical criticism of artworks (for survey, see Carroll 2000; for an\nupdate, see Eaton 2016). The aesthetic puzzle is not directly related\nto ethical criticism although insights drawn from analyzing the\naesthetic puzzle can be used to defend a view within the ethical\ncriticism debate. (See Eaton 2012 for her defense of immoralism where\nshe argues that lack of imaginative resistance toward morally deviant\nscenarios should count as an aesthetic merit.) In the cases of\nimaginative resistance, we see that we cannot easily compartmentalize\nand separate our ethical and aesthetic considerations. The aesthetic\npuzzle arises when even the idea of engaging with a work that has\nmorally repugnant content, say, one that glorifies white supremacy,\nitself feels completely wrong and repulsive. This is rather puzzling\nbecause after all, it is all supposed to be fictional, make-believe.\nWhy do we have so much anxiety over imaging something the author asks\nus to imagine and aesthetically engage with the work? This puzzling\nreaction is an extension of the reaction that is discussed under the\nimaginative puzzle. In these cases, as Walton writes,\n\n\n\n[w]hen moral considerations prevent us from appreciating a work of\nfiction, this is often, though not always, because we are unable or\nunwilling to imagine in the way the work calls for. This is the link\nbetween the aesthetic puzzle and the imaginative one. (2006: 140)\n\n \n\n\nDistinguishing the puzzles more precisely not only allows for greater\nconceptual clarity but also helps with reevaluating the previous work\ndone on imaginative resistance, giving us the ability to distinguish\nreal disagreements from pseudo-disagreements. We can reposition these\naccounts with respect to one another depending on which puzzles they\nare addressing. For instance, while Stephen Yablo (2002) focuses\nsolely on the fictionality puzzle, Gregory Currie (2002), Currie and\nRavenscroft (2002), Peter Goldie (2003), and Shaun Nichols (2006a)\naddress merely the imaginative puzzle. Moran (1994) and Walton (1994)\ntalk about all the puzzles except for the phenomenological puzzle.\nGendler (2000) and Derek Matravers (2003) discuss both the imaginative\nand fictionality puzzle. Gendler (2000) has been criticized heavily\nfor conflating the imaginative and fictionality puzzles; she\nacknowledges this problem and provides a revised version of her\naccount (2006). \n",
