    "main_text": "History of the Rule of Law || Dicey\n3.4 Dicey\n\nWriting in the second half of the 19th century, Albert Venn\nDicey bemoaned what he saw as a decline in respect for the Rule of Law\nin England. The Rule of Law used to be a proud tradition that\ndistinguished governance in England both from the executive domination\nof droit administratif in France and also from the fatuous\nand abstract certainties of paper constitutions in countries like\nBelgium etc. For Dicey, the key to the Rule of Law was legal equality:\n\n\n\n[W]ith us no man is above the law [and] every man, whatever be his\nrank or condition, is subject to the ordinary law of the realm and\namenable to the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals. (1992 [1885]:\n114) \n\n\nAttractive as this is in the abstract, it exhibited a certain naivety\nso far as the legal position of state officials was concerned.\nOfficials are and often need to be treated differently in law than the\nordinary citizen: they need certain extra powers and they need to be\nhemmed in by extra restrictions, so that they can be held accountable\nfor the actions they perform in the name of the community. For the\nordinary person, the Rule of Law generates a presumption in favor of\nliberty: everything which is not expressly prohibited is permitted.\nBut for the state and its officials, we may want to work with the\ncontrary presumption: the state may act only under express legal\nauthorization.\n\nDicey had a knack of expressing the Rule of Law in terms of principles\nwhose eloquent formulations belied their deeper difficulties. His\nfirst principle of the Rule of Law was: \n\n\n[N]o man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or\ngoods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary\nlegal manner before the ordinary Courts of the land. (Dicey 1992\n[1885]: 110) \n\n\nThis seems fine if we are talking about the imposition of criminal\nsanctions. But \u201cmade to suffer in \u2026 goods\u201d can also\nbe read to connote the imposition of restrictions on the use of\npersonal or corporate property, or the giving or withholding of\nlicenses, grants, and subsidies. It can be read as precluding any form\nof discretionary regulation. Dicey was indeed inclined to disparage\nall administrative discretion, particularly where it seemed to be\nsuperseding what had traditionally been regarded as judicial\nfunctions. But can we really do without discretion in modern\ngovernance? Some modern scholars of administrative law have denounced\nDicey\u2019s account as an \u201cextravagant\u201d,\n\u201cabsurd\u201d, and pernicious version of the Rule of Law (Davis\n1969: 27\u201332).\n",
