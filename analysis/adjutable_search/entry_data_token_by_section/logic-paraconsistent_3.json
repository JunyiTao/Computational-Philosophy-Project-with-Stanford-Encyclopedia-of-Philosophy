They were often motivated by\ndifferent considerations. The earliest paraconsistent logics in the\ncontemporary era seem to have been given by two Russians. Starting\nabout 1910, Vasil\u2019\u00e9v proposed a modified Aristotelian\nsyllogistic including statements of the form: \\(S\\) is both \\(P\\) and\nnot \\(P\\). In 1929, Orlov gave the first axiomatisation of the\nrelevant logic \\(R\\) which is paraconsistent. (On\nVasil\u2019\u00e9v, see Arruda 1977 and Arruda 1989: 102f; on\nOrlov, see Anderson, Belnap, & Dunn 1992: xvii.)\n\nThe work of Vasil\u2019\u00e9v or Orlov did not make any impact at\nthe time. The first (formal) logician to have developed paraconsistent\nlogic was Ja\u015bkowski in Poland, who was a student of\n\u0141ukasiewicz, who himself had envisaged paraconsistent logic in\nhis critique of Aristotle on the LNC (\u0141ukasiewicz 1951). Almost\nat the same time, Halld\u00e9n (1949) presented work on the logic of\nnonsense, but again this went mostly unnoticed.\n\nParaconsistent logics were developed independently in South America by\nFlorencio Asenjo and especially Newton da Costa in their doctoral\ndissertations, in 1954 and 1963 respectively, with an emphasis on\nmathematical applications (see Asenjo 1966, da Costa 1974). An active\ngroup of logicians has been researching paraconsistent logic\ncontinuously ever since, especially in Campinas and S\u00e3o Paulo,\nBrazil, with a focus on logics of formal inconsistency. Carnielli and\nConiglio (2016) give a comprehensive recent account of this work.\n\nParaconsistent logics in the forms of relevant logics were proposed in\nEngland by Smiley in 1959 and also at about the same time, in a much\nmore developed form, in the United States by Anderson and Belnap. An\nactive group of relevant logicians grew up in Pittsburgh including\nDunn, Meyer, and Urquhart. The development of paraconsistent logics (in the form\nof relevant logics) was transported to Australia. R. Routley (later\nSylvan) and V. Routley (later Plumwood) discovered an intentional\nsemantics for some of Anderson/Belnap relevant logics. A school\ndeveloped around them in Canberra which included Brady and Mortensen,\nand later Priest who, together with R. Routley, incorporated\ndialetheism to the development.\n\nSince the 1970s, the development of paraconsistent logic has been\ninternational. Some of the major schools of thought are canvassed\nbelow, including adaptive logic (as in Batens 2001) and\npreservationism (as in Schotch, Brown, & Jennings 2009). There is\nwork being done in in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada,\nthe Czech Republic, England, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico,\nNew Zealand, Poland, Scotland, Spain, the United States, and more.\nThere has been a series of major international conferences about\nparaconsistent logic. In 1997, the First World Congress on\nParaconsistency was held at the University of Ghent in Belgium. The\nSecond World Congress was held in S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o\n(S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) in 2000, the Third in Toulous (France) in\n2003 and the Fourth in Melbourne (Australia) in 2008. A Fifth World\nCongress was held in Kolkata, India in 2013. Another major\nparaconsistency conference in 2014 was held in Munich (Andreas &\nVerd\u00e9e 2016).
