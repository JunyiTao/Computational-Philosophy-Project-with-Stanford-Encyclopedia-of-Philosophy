    "main_text": "\n\nFunctionalism in the philosophy of mind is the doctrine that what\nmakes something a mental state of a particular type does not depend on\nits internal constitution, but rather on the way it functions, or the\nrole it plays, in the system of which it is a part. This doctrine is\nrooted in Aristotle\u2019s conception of the soul, and has\nantecedents in Hobbes\u2019s conception of the mind as a\n\u201ccalculating machine\u201d, but it has become fully articulated\n(and popularly endorsed) only in the last third of the 20th century.\nThough the term \u2018functionalism\u2019 is used to designate a\nvariety of positions in a variety of other disciplines, including\npsychology, sociology, economics, and architecture, this entry focuses\nexclusively on functionalism as a philosophical thesis about the\nnature of mental states.\n\nThe following sections will trace the intellectual antecedents of\ncontemporary functionalism, sketch the different types of\nfunctionalist theories, and discuss the most serious objections to\nthem.\n",
