    "main_text": "Basic Elements and Assumptions of Game Theory || Subgame Perfection\n2.6 Subgame Perfection\n\nIn order to deepen our understanding of extensive-form games, we need\nan example with more interesting structure than the PD offers. \n\nConsider the game described by this tree:\n\n\n\nFigure 9\n\n\nThis game is not intended to fit any preconceived situation; it is\nsimply a mathematical object in search of an application. (L and R\nhere just denote \u2018left\u2019 and \u2018right\u2019\nrespectively.) \n\nNow consider the strategic form of this game:\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nLL\nLR\nRL\nRR\n\n\nLL\n3,3\n3,3\n0,5\n0,5\n\nLR\n3,3\n3,3\n0,5\n0,5\n\nRL\n\u22121,0\n4,5\n\u22121,0\n4,5\n\nRR\n\u22121,0\n5,\u22121\n\u22121,0\n5,\u22121\n\n\nFigure 10\n\n\nIf you are confused by this, remember that a strategy must tell a\nplayer what to do at every information set where that player\nhas an action. Since each player chooses between two actions at each\nof two information sets here, each player has four strategies in\ntotal. The first letter in each strategy designation tells each player\nwhat to do if he or she reaches their first information set, the\nsecond what to do if their second information set is reached. I.e., LR\nfor Player II tells II to play L if information set 5 is reached and R\nif information set 6 is reached. \n\nIf you examine the matrix in Figure 10, you will discover that (LL,\nRL) is among the NE. This is a bit puzzling, since if Player I reaches\nher second information set (7) in the extensive-form game, she would\nhardly wish to play L there; she earns a higher payoff by playing R at\nnode 7. Mere NE analysis doesn\u2019t notice this because NE is\ninsensitive to what happens off the path of play. Player I,\nin choosing L at node 4, ensures that node 7 will not be reached; this\nis what is meant by saying that it is \u2018off the path of\nplay\u2019. In analyzing extensive-form games, however, we\nshould care what happens off the path of play, because\nconsideration of this is crucial to what happens on the path.\nFor example, it is the fact that Player I would play R if\nnode 7 were reached that would cause Player II to play L if\nnode 6 were reached, and this is why Player I won\u2019t choose R at\nnode 4. We are throwing away information relevant to game solutions if\nwe ignore off-path outcomes, as mere NE analysis does. Notice that\nthis reason for doubting that NE is a wholly satisfactory equilibrium\nconcept in itself has nothing to do with intuitions about rationality,\nas in the case of the refinement concepts discussed in Section\n2.5.\n\nNow apply Zermelo\u2019s algorithm to the extensive form of our\ncurrent example. Begin, again, with the last subgame, that descending\nfrom node 7. This is Player I\u2019s move, and she would choose R\nbecause she prefers her payoff of 5 to the payoff of 4 she gets by\nplaying L. Therefore, we assign the payoff \\((5, -1)\\) to node 7. Thus\nat node 6 II faces a choice between \\((-1, 0)\\) and \\((5, -1)\\). He\nchooses L. At node 5 II chooses R. At node 4 I is thus choosing\nbetween (0, 5) and \\((-1, 0)\\), and so plays L. Note that, as in the\nPD, an outcome appears at a terminal node\u2014(4, 5) from node\n7\u2014that is Pareto superior to the NE. Again, however, the\ndynamics of the game prevent it from being reached.\n\nThe fact that Zermelo\u2019s algorithm picks out the strategy vector\n(LR, RL) as the unique solution to the game shows that it\u2019s\nyielding something other than just an NE. In fact, it is generating\nthe game\u2019s subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE). It gives\nan outcome that yields a NE not just in the whole game but in\nevery subgame as well. This is a persuasive solution concept because,\nagain unlike the refinements of Section 2.5, it does not demand\n\u2018extra\u2019 rationality of agents in the sense of expecting\nthem to have and use philosophical intuitions about \u2018what makes\nsense\u2019. It does, however, assume that players not only know\neverything strategically relevant to their situation but also\nuse all of that information. In arguments about the\nfoundations of economics, this is often referred to as an aspect of\nrationality, as in the phrase \u2018rational expectations\u2019.\nBut, as noted earlier, it is best to be careful not to confuse the\ngeneral normative idea of rationality with computational power and the\npossession of budgets, in time and energy, to make the most of it.\n\nAn agent playing a subgame perfect strategy simply chooses, at every\nnode she reaches, the path that brings her the highest payoff in\nthe subgame emanating from that node. SPE predicts a game\u2019s\noutcome just in case, in solving the game, the players foresee that\nthey will all do that.\n\nA main value of analyzing extensive-form games for SPE is that this\ncan help us to locate structural barriers to social optimization. In\nour current example, Player I would be better off, and Player II no\nworse off, at the left-hand node emanating from node 7 than at the SPE\noutcome. But Player I\u2019s economic rationality, and Player\nII\u2019s awareness of this, blocks the socially efficient outcome.\nIf our players wish to bring about the more socially efficient outcome\n(4, 5) here, they must do so by redesigning their institutions so as\nto change the structure of the game. The enterprise of changing\ninstitutional and informational structures so as to make efficient\noutcomes more likely in the games that agents (that is, people,\ncorporations, governments, etc.) actually play is known as\nmechanism design, and is one of the leading areas of\napplication of game theory. The main techniques are reviewed in\n Hurwicz and Reiter (2006),\n the first author of which was awarded the Nobel Prize for his\npioneering work in the area.\n",
