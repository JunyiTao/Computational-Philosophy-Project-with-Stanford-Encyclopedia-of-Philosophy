    "main_text": "Decision || Infinite utility streams\n7.4 Infinite utility streams\n\nSo far we have been considering decisions in which one\u2019s payoff\ncomes in a single \u2018hit\u2019: a reward (or punishment) comes\nall at once. However, we can also consider cases in which one is to\nchoose between different infinite utility streams\u2014e.g.,\nstreams of finite daily utility that accumulate over an infinite\nfuture. There is an obvious candidate for evaluating the utility of a\nfinite stream: add the utilities along the stream. But this method is\nnot available when we have an infinite stream; we require additional\nprinciples to help us evaluate such streams, and it is not obvious\nwhat those principles should be.\n\nSuppose that a day spent in Heaven has utility 1 and a day spent in\nHell has utility \\(-1\\). Suppose further that, for all \\(n\\), \\(n\\)\ndays in Heaven have utility \\(n\\), and \\(n\\) days in Hell have utility\n\\(-n\\). Suppose, finally, that, for all \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), any\ncombination of \\(m\\) days in Heaven and \\(n\\) days in Hell has utility\n\\(m - n\\).\n\nHere are some candidate principles for the comparison of alternative\npossible future utility streams:\n\nOne should prefer the possible future utility stream that has\nmaximal total utility (if there is one).\nIf more than one possible future utility stream has divergent\nutility\u2014i.e. is such that there is no finite value to which the\ntotal utility of the stream converges as the number of days\nincreases\u2014one should prefer the divergent utility stream whose\npartial sum is dominant (if there is one). This means that on\nsome days, the sum of utility to that day is greater than for any\nother stream, and on no days, the sum of utility to that day is less\nthan for some other stream.\nIf more than one possible future utility stream has divergent\nutility, one should be indifferent between divergent future utility\nstreams that are permutations of one another.\n\n\nConsider the choice between the following two infinite utility\nstreams:\n\nAn infinite number of days in Heaven.\nAn infinite number of days in Heaven preceded by a finite number\nof days in Hell.\n\n\nPrinciple 2 says correctly that we should prefer (a) to (b).\n\nHowever, consider the choice between the following two options:\n\nAn infinite number of alternating days, first in Heaven, and then\nin Hell.\nAn infinite number of alternating days, first in Hell, and then in\nHeaven.\n\n\nPrinciple 2 says, incorrectly presumably, that we should prefer (c) to\n(d).\n\nNow consider the choice between the following two options:\n\nAn infinite number of alternating days, first in Heaven, and then\nin Hell.\nAn infinite number of alternating days, first one in Heaven and\none in Hell, then two in Heaven and one in Hell, then three in Heaven\nand one in Hell, and so on.\n\n\nWhile Principle 3 says, (perhaps) correctly that we should be\nindifferent between (c) and (d), it also says, (surely) incorrectly,\nthat we should be indifferent between (e) and (f).\n\nIn the face of these difficulties, you might consider weakening the\nprinciples:\n\nIf more than one possible future utility stream has divergent\nutility, prefer the divergent possible future utility stream that is\nstep-by-step dominant (if there is one).\nIf more than one possible future utility stream has divergent\nutility, maintain indifference between divergent possible future\nutility streams that are finite permutations of one another (i.e. that\ncan be derived from one another by finitely many exchanges at\nneighbouring steps).\n\n\nBut this pair of principles yields no verdict in the case of (e) and\n(f), and so does not yield a complete set of principles.\n\nMore generally, it is hard to codify rules for choosing among infinite\nutility streams. Indeed, there are some impossibility results in the\neconomics literature which suggest that there is no fully satisfactory\ntheory that countenances them.\n\nFor further discussion of infinite utility streams, see, for example:\nSegerberg (1976), Jeffrey (1983), Nelson (1991), Vallentyne (1993,\n1994, 1995), Cain (1995), Ng (1995), Van Liedekerke (1995), Lauwers\n(1997a, 1997b, 1997c, 1997d), Vallentyne and Kagan (1997), Basu and\nMitra (2003), Crespo, Nu\u00f1ez, and Rincou-Zapatero (2009),\nBartha, Barker and H\u00e1jek (2014), and Jonsson and Voorneveld\n(2015).\n\nEach of these decisions problems wears its infinitude on its sleeve:\nit is obvious that there are infinitely many possible actions, or\ninfinitely many states, or infinite utility, or infinite streams of\nutility. However, in some problems, such infinitude is not\nforegrounded, but it is tacitly there nonetheless. The\ntwo-envelope paradox is such a problem. See the\n\nSupplement on Tacitly Infinite Decision Problems: Two Envelopes.\n\nThere are various other paradoxes of infinity in decision\ntheory\u2014the interested reader may follow these references:\n\n\u201cAn Infinite Decision Puzzle\u201d: Barrett and Arntzenius\n(1999)\n\u201cTrumped\u201d: Arntzenius and McCarthy (1997)\n\u201cRouble Trouble\u201d: Arntzenius and Barrett (1999)\n\u201cThe Airtight Dutch Book\u201d: McGee (1999)\nSeveral paradoxes in Arntzenius, Elga and Hawthorne (2004)\n\u201cThe Cable Guy\u201d: H\u00e1jek (2005).\n\n",
