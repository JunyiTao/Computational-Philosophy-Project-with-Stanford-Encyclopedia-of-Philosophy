    "main_text": "The Focus of the Debate\n1. The Focus of the Debate\n\nThe debate between possibilists and actualists is at root\nontological. It is not\u2014fundamentally, at least\u2014a\ndebate about meaning, or the proper linguistic primitives of our modal\ndiscourse, or the model theory of certain formal languages, or the\npermissibility of certain inferences. It is a disagreement over\nwhat there is, about the kinds of things that reality\nincludes. Characterizing the nature of the debate precisely, however,\nis challenging. As noted in the preceding introduction, the debate\ncenters around the question of whether, in addition to such things as\nyou and me, reality includes possibilia, such as\nBergoglio\u2019s merely possible children, the children he does not\nactually have but could have had if only things had\ngone rather differently. Clearly, if there are such things in\nsome sense, they differ from us rather dramatically: a merely possible\nchild is not actually anyone\u2019s child and indeed, we are\ninclined to say, does not actually exist at all and, hence,\nis not actually conscious but only could have been, does not actually\nhave a body but only could have had one, and so on. As we will see in\nmore detail in the following section, in many historical and more\ncontemporary discussions, this alleged difference is characterized in\nterms of distinct ways, or modes, of being, and it\nwill be useful, for now, to continue to frame the debate in these\nterms. Specifically, on this bi-modal conception of the\ndebate, on the one hand, there is the more substantial and robust mode\nof actuality (or, often, existence) that you and I\nenjoy. And, on the other hand, there is the more rarefied mode\n(sometimes called subsistence) exhibited by things that fail\nto be\n actual.[4]\n While (as we will see) there has been some disagreement over the\nlocation of abstract objects like the natural numbers in this scheme,\nwhat uniquely distinguishes possibilia on the bi-modal\nconception is that, for the possibilist, they are\ncontingently non-actual:\n\nPoss:\nThere are possibilia, that is, things that are not actual\nbut could have been.\n\n\nIt is clarifying to represent matters more formally. Accordingly,\nwhere \\(\\sfA!\\) is the actuality predicate, we have:\n\nPoss\\(_{\\sfA!}\\):\n\\(\\exists \\sfx(\\neg \\sfA!\\sfx \\land \\Diamond \\sfA!\\sfx)\\)\n\n\nAs noted in the above introduction, in its simplest form, actualism is\njust the denial of possibilism: there are no mere possibilia.\nHowever, the actualist\u2019s denial is meant to be stronger: that\npossibilism is false is not a mere historical accident; rather, for\nthe actualist, not only are there not in fact any possibilia,\nthere couldn\u2019t be any:\n\nAct:\nThere could not have been any possibilia, that is, any\nthings that are not actual but could have been\n\n\nor, again, more formally:\n\nAct\\(_{\\sfA!}\\):\n\u00a0\\(\\neg\\Diamond\\exists \\sfx(\\neg \\sfA!\\sfx \\land \\Diamond\n\\sfA!\\sfx)\\)\n\n\nFor the actualist, then, the possibilist\u2019s purported mode of\ncontingent non-actuality, or mere possibility, is empty:\nnecessarily, anything that could have been actual already\nis actual. Otherwise put, necessarily, there are no\ncontingently non-actual\n things.[5]\n\nActualism is quite clearly the preferred common sense position here:\non a first hearing, the idea that the Pope\u2019s unborn children\ndwell in some shadowy corner of reality is to most ears ludicrous on\nits face\u2014and defending against this common sense intuition\nremains arguably the central challenge facing the possibilist. But the\nmotivations for possibilism are surprisingly strong. We have already\nnoted what is perhaps the strongest of these: possibilism yields a\nstraightforward, unified semantics for our modal discourse. By\nappealing to possibilia, the possibilist can provide\nsatisfying truth conditions for otherwise semantically problematic\nmodal statements like\n (2)\n along the lines of those for\n (1)\n that ground their intuitive truth in the modal properties of\nindividuals. As we might also put it: possibilism provides\n truthmakers\n for such statements as\n (2)\n that actualism is apparently unable to supply. But a powerful second\nmotivation is that possibilism falls out as a consequence of\nthe most natural quantified modal logic. In particular, in that logic,\n (4)\n is an immediate logical consequence of\n (2).\n (We will spell out these motivations further in the following two\nsections.) These motivations in turn present a twofold\nchallenge for the actualist:\n\nto provide a systematic and philosophically satisfying account of\ntruth conditions for the likes of\n (2);\n and\nto develop a robust quantified modal logic that invalidates such\ninferences as the one from\n (2)\n to\n (4).\n\n\nWhat makes the possibilism-actualism debate so interesting is that,\nwhile actualism is the overwhelming metaphysical choice of most\nphilosophers, there is no easy or obvious way for the actualist to\nmeet these challenges. We will explore a number of attempts in this\nessay. \n",
