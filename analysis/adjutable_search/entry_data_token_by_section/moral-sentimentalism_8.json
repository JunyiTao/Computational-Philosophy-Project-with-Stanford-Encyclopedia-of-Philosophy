    "main_text": "Judgment Sentimentalism || Cognitivist Sentimentalism: Sensibility Theory and Neo-Sentimentalism\n3.4 Cognitivist Sentimentalism: Sensibility Theory and Neo-Sentimentalism\n\nThe cognitivist sentimentalist views discussed in the previous section\nappealed to beliefs about dispositions to cause sentimental\nresponses in certain kind of subjects. The other main type of\ncognitivist view, sensibility theory, regards judgments as\nbeliefs about merited responses (Wiggins 1987; McDowell\n1998). Sensibility theory begins with an analogy with secondary\nquality concepts, such as colour concepts. These concepts, according\nto many, are concepts of mind-dependent qualities. Sensibility\ntheorists believe they are partially analogous with value concepts,\nthe difference being that value is\n\n\nconceived to be not merely such as to elicit the appropriate\n\u2018attitude\u2019 \u2026 but rather such as to merit\nit. (McDowell 1985: 143)\n\n\nWhen we conceive of value in this way, we perceive there to be a\nreason for, say, admiring or emulating someone (McDowell\n1979).\n\nThis state of perceiving or conceiving of there being a reason is a\nbelief of a unique and controversial sort. According to John McDowell\n(1978), it can explain a virtuous person\u2019s action without the\nhelp of a related desire playing a causal role (although we can\nrightly attribute a desire to a person as a consequence of\ntheir being motivated by the perception of a reason). McDowell thus\nrejects the Humean Theory of Motivation\n (premise 2\n in the Argument from Internalism). His arguments are inspired by his\nreading of Aristotle rather than the Early Modern sentimentalist\ntradition. Roughly, a virtuous person sees situations in a distinctive\nway (McDowell 1979: 73), so that certain features, like\nsomeone\u2019s need to know something, are salient to her,\nwhile other concerns are silenced, and thus do not stand out\nas calling for action. This \u2018moral vision\u2019 (Murdoch 1970)\nthen suffices to explain what the agent does.\n\nA familiar objection is that it is possible for someone to share the\nvirtuous person\u2019s belief or \u201cconception of the\nsituation\u201d but nevertheless lack the motivation. McDowell denies\nthis:\n\n\n[T]he relevant conceptions are not so much as possessed except by\nthose whose wills are influenced appropriately. (McDowell 1978:\n87)\n\n\nOne argument in favour of this is that there is a difference between\nbeing virtuous and being continent. Both kinds of agents do the right\nthing \u2013 for example, both remain faithful to their partner. But\nthe continent agent has to struggle with competing desires that cloud\ntheir attention on the noble and the fine. She has to muster willpower\nto keep from temptation. The difference between her and the virtuous\nperson, on this picture, is not in the first instance a conative one,\nbut a difference in what is salient, which is simultaneously a\ncognitive and affective difference. In David McNaughton\u2019s terms,\n\u201ca way of seeing a situation may itself be a way of caring or\nfeeling\u201d (McNaughton 1988: 113). A consequence of this view is\nthat the process of coming to appreciate practical reasons will\ninvolve shaping the agent\u2019s motivational sensitivities and may\nitself be akin to a non-rational conversion rather than to rational\ndeliberation from existing motives (McDowell 1995: 100\u2013101).\n\nSensibility theories belong in the category Justin D\u2019Arms and\nDaniel Jacobson (2000a) have labelled neo-sentimentalism. It\nis, officially, the view that evaluative concepts are\nconcepts of appropriateness of sentimental responses. (As will be\ndiscussed in\n Section 4.3,\n neo-sentimentalists often make related metaphysical claims about\nevaluative properties.) That is, to think that something is\nshameful is to think that shame is appropriate or that there is\nsufficient reason for it. A key motivation for neo-sentimentalism is\nthat making a judgment about desirability or shamefulness is distinct\nfrom desiring or being ashamed. The point of using and introducing\nnormative concepts is to guide our attitudes rather than just\nexpress or report them. (See the entry on\n Fitting Attitude Theories of Value.)\n",
