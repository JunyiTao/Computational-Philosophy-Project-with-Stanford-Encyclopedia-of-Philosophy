    "main_text": "The Logic of Collective Action || History\n1.1 History\n\n\nThe free rider problem and the logic of collective action have been\nrecognized in specific contexts for millennia. Arguably, Glaucon in\nPlato\u2019s Republic (bk. 2, 360b\u2013c) sees the logic in his\nargument against obedience to the law if only one can escape sanction\nfor violations. First-time readers of Plato are often astonished that\ndear old Socrates seems not to get the logic but insists that it is our\ninterest to obey the law independently of the incentive of its\nsanctions.\n\n\nAdam Smith\u2019s argument for the invisible hand that keeps sellers\ncompetitive rather than in collusion is a fundamentally important and\nbenign\u2014indeed, beneficial\u2014instance of the logic of collective\naction. He says that each producer \u201cintends only his own gain,\nand he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to\npromote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the\nworse for the society that it was no part of [the individual\u2019s intended\nend]. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of\nsociety more effectually than when he really intends to promote\nit\u201d (Smith [1776] 1976, bk. 4, chap. 2, p. 456). The back of the\ninvisible hand swats down efforts at price collusion, thereby pushing\nproducers to be innovative.\n\n\nDavid Hume grasps the generality of the problem clearly. He\nsays:\nTwo neighbours may agree to drain a meadow, which they\npossess in common; because \u2018tis easy for them to know each other\u2019s\nmind; and each must perceive, that the immediate consequence of his\nfailing in his part, is, the abandoning the whole project. But \u2018tis\nvery difficult, and indeed impossible, that a thousand persons shou\u2019d\nagree in any such action; it being difficult for them to concert so\ncomplicated a design, and still more difficult for them to execute it;\nwhile each seeks a pretext to free himself of the trouble and expence,\nand wou\u2019d lay the whole burden on others. (Hume [1739\u201340] 1978, bk. 3,\npart 2, sect. 8, p. 538).\n\n\nJohn Stuart Mill ([1848] 1965, book 5, chap. 11, sect. 12) expresses\nthe logic very clearly in his defense of laws to require maximum hours\nof work. He supposes that all workers would be better off if the\nworkday were reduced from, say ten to nine hours a day for all, but\nthat every individual worker would be better off working the extra hour\nif most others do not. The only way for them to benefit from the\nshorter workday, therefore, would be to make it illegal to work longer\nthan nine hours a day.\n\n\nVilfredo Pareto stated the logic fully and for the general case:\nIf all individuals refrained from doing A, every\nindividual as a member of the community would derive a certain\nadvantage. But now if all individuals less one continue\nrefraining from doing A, the community loss is very slight, whereas the\none individual doing A makes a personal gain far greater than the loss\nthat he incurs as a member of the community. (Pareto 1935, vol. 3,\nsect. 1496, pp. 946\u20137)\n\n\nPareto\u2019s argument is framed for the negative case, such as the\nexample of pollution above, but it fits positive provisions as well.\nUnfortunately, his argument is buried in a large four-volume magnum\nopus that is a rambling discussion of many and varied topics, and it\nseems to have had little or no influence on further discussion.\n\n\nFinally, the logic of collective action has long been generalized in\na loose way in the notion of the free rider problem. And it is captured\nin the popular slogan, \u201cLet George do it,\u201d in which George\ntypically stands in for the rest of the world.\n\n\nDespite such frequent and widespread recognition of the logic, it\nwas finally generalized analytically by Mancur Olson only in 1965 in\nhis Logic of Collective Action. The odd mismatch of individual\nincentives and what may loosely be called collective interests is the\nindependent discovery of two game theorists who invented the prisoner\u2019s\ndilemma for two persons (see Hardin 1982a, 24\u20135) and of various\nphilosophers and social theorists who have noted the logic of\ncollective action in various contexts. In Olson\u2019s account, what had\nbeen a fairly minor issue for economists became a central issue for\npolitical scientists and social theorists more generally. From early in\nthe twentieth century, a common view of collective action in pluralist\ngroup politics was that policy on any issue must be, roughly, a vector\nsum of the forces of all of the groups interested in the issue (Bentley\n1908). In this standard vision, one could simply count the number of\nthose interested in an issue, weight them by their intensity and the\ndirection they want policy to take, and sum the result geometrically to\nsay what the policy must be. Olson\u2019s analysis abruptly ended this long\ntradition; and group theory in politics took on, as the central task,\ntrying to understand why some groups organize and others do not.\n\n\nAmong the major casualties of Olson\u2019s revision of our views of groups\nis Karl Marx\u2019s analysis of class conflict. Although many scholars\nstill elaborate and defend Marx\u2019s vision, others now reject it as\nfailing to recognize the contrary incentives that members of the\nworking class face. (Oddly, Marx himself arguably saw the\ncross-cutting\u2014individual vs. group\u2014incentives of\ncapitalists, the other major group in his account.) This problem had\nlong been recognized in the thesis of the embourgeoisement of the\nworking class: Once workers prosper enough to buy homes and to benefit\nin other ways from the current level of economic development, they may\nhave so much to lose from revolutionary class action that they cease\nto be potential revolutionaries.\n\n\nIn essence, the theories that Olson\u2019s argument demolished were all\ngrounded in a fallacy of composition. We commit this fallacy whenever\nwe suppose the characteristics of a group or set are the\ncharacteristics of the members of the group or set or vice versa. In\nthe theories that fail Olson\u2019s test the fact that it would be in the\ncollective interest of some group to have a particular result, even\ncounting the costs of providing the result, is turned into the\nassumption that it would be in the interest of each individual in the\ngroup to bear the individual costs of contributing to the group\u2019s\ncollective provision. If the group has an interest in contributing to\nprovision of its good, then individual members are (sometimes wrongly)\nassumed to have an interest in contributing. Sometimes, this assumption\nis merely shorthand for the recognition that all the members of a group\nare of the same mind on some issue. For example, a group of anti-war\nmarchers are of one mind with respect to the issue that gets them\nmarching. There might be many who are along for the entertainment, to\njoin a friend or spouse, or even to spy on the marchers, but the modal\nmotivation of the individuals in the group might well be the motivation\nsummarily attributed to the group. But very often the move from\nindividual to group intentions or vice versa is wrong.\n\n\nThis fallacious move between individual and group motivations and\ninterests pervades and vitiates much of social theory since at least\nAristotle\u2019s opening sentence in the Politics. He says,\nWe see that every city-state is a community of some sort,\nand that every community is established for the sake of some good (for\neveryone performs every action for the sake of what he takes to be\ngood). (Aristotle Politics, book 1, chap. 1, p.\n1)\n\n\nEven if we grant his parenthetical characterization of individual\nreasons for action, it does not follow that the collective creation of\na city-state is grounded in the same motivations, or in any collective\nmotivation at all. Most likely, any actual city-state is the product in\nlarge part of unintended consequences.\n\n\nArgument from the fallacy of composition seems to be very appealing\neven though completely wrong. Systematically rejecting the fallacy of\ncomposition in social theory, perhaps especially in normative theory,\nhas required several centuries, and invocation of the fallacy is still\npervasive.\n",
