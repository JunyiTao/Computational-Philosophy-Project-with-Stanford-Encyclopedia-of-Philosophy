    "main_text": "Arguments against Fictionalism || The Brock-Rosen objection\n4.7 The Brock-Rosen objection\n\nHere is a simple way to lay out what is known as the Brock-Rosen\nobjection to modal fictionalism. (Taken from Divers and Hagen\u2019s\n(2006) presentation.) Consider the proposition\n\n(P) There is a plurality of worlds,\n\n\nwhere by \u2018worlds\u2019 we mean Lewisian possible worlds. The\nmodal fictionalist doesn\u2019t want to commit herself to the literal\ntruth of P. But the objection is that she ends up doing so\nanyway. For\n\n(1) According to the modal fiction, at every world, P.\n\n\nNow, the modal fictionalist holds, the objection goes, that for every\nmodal sentence \u2018A\u2019,\n\n(M) \u2018A\u2019 is true iff according to the\nmodal fiction, A*,\n\n\nwhere \u2018A*\u2019 is the translation of\n\u2018A\u2019 into possible worlds talk.\n\nAn instance of (M) is then\n\n(2) \u2018Necessarily P\u2019 is true iff according to the\nmodal fiction, at every world, P.\n\n\nBy (1) and (2) together with disquotational principles concerning\ntruth,\n\n(3) Necessarily P.\n\n\nAnd hence,\n\n(4) P.\n\n\nAlthough the Brock-Rosen objection was first raised against modal\nfictionalism and has been most discussed in that context, it is\nimportant to note that the objection generalizes. For instance, one\ncan run a similar argument in the case of numbers. (This was first\nstressed in Nolan and O\u2019Leary-Hawthorne 1996.) Here is how the\nobjection goes in that case. \n\nAccording to mathematical fictionalism,\n\n(#) For any sort of entity F, There are n\nFs iff according to the numbers fiction, The number of Fs\n= n.\n\n\nBut now apply this to numbers. An immediate consequence is that the\nfictionalist must conclude that (strictly and literally) there are\nnumbers. \n\nOne diagnosis \u2014 and purported resolution \u2014 of this problem\nrelates to the distinctions earlier drawn. According to this\ndiagnosis, what the objection at most shows is that the fictionalist\nshould be a use fictionalist. If any kind of fictionalist has to rely\non general translation schemes such as (M) or (#) it is the\nmeaning fictionalist. The use fictionalist can, with no real loss,\nemploy them more selectively: it is only when speaking within the\nfiction that we rely on them. (For this diagnosis, presented in\ndifferent terms, see Nolan and O\u2019Leary-Hawthorne 1996, Yablo\n2001, and Woodward 2007. For more on the Brock-Rosen objection to\nmodal fictionalism, see the entry on\n modal fictionalism.)\n",
