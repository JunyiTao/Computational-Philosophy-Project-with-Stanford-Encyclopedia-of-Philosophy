    "main_text": "Neo-Confucian Metaphysical Recalibration || Neo-Confucianism and Social Transformation\n2.2 Neo-Confucianism and Social Transformation\n\nAn Hyang (1243\u20131306) was one of the most important Korean\nscholars responsible for introducing Neo-Confucian ideas into the\nKorean peninsula, he \u201ccopied [Confucian Classics] by hand, drew\n(Zhu Xi\u2019s) likeness and brought them back home\u201d (Deuchler\n1992: 17). Paek I-j\u014fng (1247\u20131323) and other Korean\nscholars also helped transmit the new philosophy to Korea as they\nbecame acquainted with many Chinese Neo-Confucian scholars, including\nthe direct successors of the Cheng-Zhu tradition, who met at the\nMan\u2019gw\u014fndang library (the hall of ten thousand scrolls)\nfounded by King Ch\u2019ungs\u014fn (1308\u20131313) in the Mongol\ncapital of the Yuan empire (Deuchler 1992: 19). Furthermore, Yi\nChe-hy\u014fn (1287\u20131367) endorsed the printing of The Four\nBooks and believed that a king should indeed be a\n\u201csage\u201d and interpreted the relationship between government\nand Neo-Confucianism as essential. Yi Saek (1328\u20131396), son of\nYi Che-hy\u014fn, was responsible for the dissemination of the texts\nin Korea where Neo-Confucian prestige was increasing rapidly, and he\nwas \u201cappointed educational intendant for the Yuan in\nKorea\u201d (De Bary & Haboush 1985b: 41). Hence,\nNeo-Confucianism was linked to education and governing the state,\nwhile shaped by a moral code of ethics.\n\nThese revitalised Confucian ethics would redefine the moral guiding\ndiscourse of the emerging Chos\u014fn dynasty (1392\u20131910).\nCh\u014fng Toj\u014fn (1342\u20131398), who helped to validate the\nnew kingship, instigated a rejuvenation of Confucian morality, that\nwould culminate in a renewal of society through the use of propriety,\nmanifest in specific rites (K. ye) (Deuchler 2004: 46). Lee\nSang-wha (2005) draws attention to the remodeling of patriarchal\npatterns of behaviour, validated through the metaphysics of the Yin,\nor \u016cm in Korean (as weak) and Yang (as strong), linked\nto the social functions of women (as passive) and men (as active),\nalso inculcated through the study of detailed ritual sourcebooks,\nespecially Zhuzi jiali (\u6731\u5b50\u5bb6\u79ae)\n[Zhu Xi\u2019s Family Rites], which linked personal self-discipline\nwith the cultivation of the mind through the rigid application of\npropriety. In the Korean context, propriety was embodied by four\nspecific rites that were to be put into practice to reorganise\nsociety: coming of age (also known as capping), wedding, mourning, and\nmost importantly, ancestral rites (Deuchler 1992: 108\u2013111). In\nKorea, rites were made a legal requirement and even encoded into the\nnational \u201cGrand Code for State Administration\u201d, known as\nthe Ky\u014fngguk taej\u014fn\n(\u7d93\u570b\u5927\u5178), first promulgated in the late\nfifteenth century. Failure to perform the prescribed rituals could\nlead to physical punishment, imprisonment, and even death (as would be\nthe case for thousands of Catholics during the nineteenth century).\nThese laws asserted and ingrained a newly prescribed Neo-Confucian\ncultural order into the social matrix, that suppressed and repressed\nany challenges to its authority, including Buddhism.\n",
