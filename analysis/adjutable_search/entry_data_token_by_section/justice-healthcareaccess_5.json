    "main_text": "Does Justice Require Universal Access to Health Care? || Health, Opportunity, and Universal Access\n3.1 Health, Opportunity, and Universal Access\n\nOne prominent line of argument in favor of universal access to some\nforms of health care builds on the contribution made by\nhealth\u2014and derivatively by health care\u2014to the\nopportunities people can exercise. The most explicit version of this\nargument extends Rawls\u2019s appeal to a principle assuring fair\nequality of opportunity (Daniels 1981, 1985, 2008). Variants on that\nargument can be extrapolated from Sen\u2019s (1980, 1992) work on\ncapabilities or from Arneson\u2019s (1988) and Cohen\u2019s (1989)\nversions of \u201cequal opportunity for welfare or advantage,\u201d\nthough there will be differences among these variants in what kinds of\ncare are covered and under what conditions.\n\nThe fair equality of opportunity argument for universal access can be\nsketched as follows:\n\nSuppose health consists of functioning normally for some\nappropriate reference class (e.g. a gender specific subgroup) of a\nspecies; in effect, health is the absence of significant\npathology.\nMaintaining normal functioning\u2014that is health\u2014makes a\nsignificant\u2014if limited\u2014contribution to protecting the\nrange of opportunities individuals can reasonably exercise; departures\nfrom normal functioning decrease the range of plans of life we can\nreasonably choose among to the extent that it diminishes the\nfunctionings we can exercise (our capabilities).\nVarious socially controllable factors contribute to maintaining\nnormal functioning in a population and distributing health fairly in\nit, including traditional public health and medical interventions, as\nwell as the distribution of such social determinants of health as\nincome and wealth, education, and control over life and work.\nIf we have social obligations to protect the opportunity range\nopen to individuals, as some general theories of justice, such as\nRawls\u2019s justice as fairness, claim, then we have obligations to\npromote and protect normal functioning for all.\nProviding universal access to a reasonable array of public health\nand medical interventions in part meets our social obligation to\nprotect the opportunity range of individuals, though reasonable people\nmay disagree about what is included within such an array of\ninterventions, given resource and technological limits.\n\n\nSome comments will clarify the main points in this sketch. First, the\nnarrow concept of health does not preclude the broad range of\ndeterminants of health noted in (3), yet the narrower notion is about\nwhat epidemiologists and public health planners measure and care. This\nnarrower concept of health avoids conflating health with well being\nmore generally, which the WHO definition of health arguably does\n(\u201cHealth is a state of complete physical, mental and social\nwell-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\u201d)\n(WHO 1948). Obviously, though, normal functioning includes cognitive\nand emotional functioning and not just physical health, for we are\ncomplex social animals. Health remains a \u201climit\u201d or\n\u201cceiling\u201d concept, unlike income, for we cannot increase\nhealth indefinitely but must aim only for normal functioning for\nall.\n\nSecond, protecting and promoting normal functioning is not the only\nfactor affecting the range of opportunities open to people. Income,\neducation, and basic liberties, as well as other factors, do so as\nwell. Nevertheless, the loss of functioning or premature death that\nmay come with ill health clearly diminishes the range of plans of life\npeople can reasonably choose among in a given society. Accordingly,\nprotecting health protects opportunity, even if it is not the only\nthing that does so. A crucial feature of the argument is that we are\nconcerned about the health of all because we are concerned about\nprotecting the opportunity range of all.\n\nThird, we have learned much in the last several decades about the\nbroader social determinants of health (see entry by Sreenivasan on\nHealth Inequalities and Justice), especially that the presence of\nuniversal access in a society does not eliminate or significantly\nreduce health inequalities in it. Does the importance of other\nsocially controllable factors that affect population health and its\ndistribution mean that providing universal access to an appropriate\nset of public health and personal medical services is less important\n(see Sreenivasan 2007)? Suppose we learn that some expensive\nindividual interventions contribute less to protecting the opportunity\nrange of individuals than redistributing some other important goods\nthat are determinants of health. That might well mean that we should\nspend less on health care and redefine the benefit package we provide\nin a universal access system. But it should not mean that we abandon\nuniversal access to care, even if it means we ought to shrink the\nrange of medical services open to people in light of other ways to\nreduce risks of loss of functioning. No matter how justly we\ndistribute the broader determinants of health, some people will become\nill and others not. Universal access to reasonable care (given its\nrelative effectiveness compared to other things we may do) is still\nthe only way to assure people that certain health needs can be\nequitably met.\n\nFourth, the extension of Rawls\u2019s theory introduces some\nmodification in the account of opportunity, but the modification is\nnot inconsistent with the thrust of justice as fairness. Justice as\nfairness abstracts from health status differences in its assumption\nthat agents are choosing principles to govern people who are fully\nfunctional over a normal lifespan. This simplification drew criticism\nfrom Arrow (1973) and later Sen (1980), for it means the method of\njudging inequality, the index of primary social goods, would fail to\naccount for the inability of people in some health states to convert\nthose goods into the same level of well-being as people functioning\nnormally. Rawls\u2019s (1971) notion of opportunity is primarily\ngeared to the strategic importance of access to jobs and offices;\nhealth, viewed as normal functioning, clearly has a bearing on access\nto jobs and offices, but we also need a broader account of opportunity\nif we are to address the impact of health on other important aspects\nof life. In borrowing justification for a principle assuring fair\nequality of opportunity, then, and then using it to apply to a broader\nnotion of opportunity, the argument involves a modification of\nRawls\u2019s own arguments. Nevertheless, he seems to have adopted\nthis view of how to extend his theory (Rawls 1995: 184, n.14; Rawls\n2001: 175, n.58).\n\nDespite this modification, the approach preserves a key feature of\nRawls\u2019s original idealization away from consideration of health\nstates: in aiming to keep all in a population functioning normally\nover a normal lifespan, we aim to keep the real world as close to the\nidealization as possible. A crucial consequence of this is that we are\nnot simply focused on equalizing opportunity, but on promoting the\nbroadened range of opportunity that comes with normal functioning for\neveryone. The view aims at promoting population health and not simply\nequalizing it: equally bad health is not the goal of the argument. Put\nanother way, the ultimate goal of health policy is that all people\nfunction normally: but that means the ultimate goal is both\negalitarian and maximizing (though short of the ultimate goal, we face\nimportant trade-offs).\n\nFinally, we must consider how we can meet health needs fairly when we\ncannot meet them all. The question is especially difficult because we\nhave reasonable disagreements about what interventions to include in a\nuniversal access system, as we noted earlier when we noted how\nreasonable disagreements will arise about the tradeoff between\nimproved financial protection, say by reducing the co-pays or\ndeductibles a benefit involves, and coverage of more types of services\nduring deliberations about the comprehensiveness of a universal\ncoverage benefit package. This is true even if we accept the principle\nof fair equality of opportunity principle as the appropriate principle\nto govern health and health care.\n\nThe problem is that the fair equality of opportunity principle is too\ngeneral and indeterminate to address a family of \u201cunsolved\nrationing problems\u201d (Daniels 1993). For example, when we are\nthinking of investing in a new service or technology, we may agree\nthat we should give those who are worst off in their health some\npriority over those who are better off. But we may wonder how much\npriority we should give them if we can produce much bigger improvement\nin health for those who are somewhat better off. Similarly, we may\nagree not to allow many trivial benefits to outweigh significant ones,\nbut we may still disagree about when do modest benefits for larger\nnumbers of people outweigh significant benefits for fewer people. In\nthese and other problems, reasonable people\u2014people seeking\nreasons that can form the basis for a mutual justification of\npolicy\u2014will disagree about how to make the tradeoffs among the\ncompeting values at issue, even if they agree that the overall goal of\nhealth policy should be to protect opportunity. We lack prior\nagreement on more fine-grained principles that tell us how best to\nprotect opportunity in this context. Because we lack a consensus on\nsuch principles, we should engage a form of procedural justice or fair\nprocess to yield fair outcomes.\n\nOne version of such a process is called \u201caccountability for\nreasonableness\u201d (Daniels and Sabin 2008). It requires a search\nfor mutually justifiable reasons, publicity about the grounds for\ndecisions, revisability of decisions in light of new evidence and\narguments, and assurance that the process is adhered to. The specific\nfeatures of such a fair process would have to be adapted to the\ninstitutional level at which it is used to make decisions about what\nto cover. Specifically, decisions about the content of a universal\naccess benefit package should be specified through a fair,\ndeliberative process that conforms to these general conditions. In\nSection 5 we shall return to consider in more detail what kinds of\ninterventions are in general supported by this account.\n\nAccountability for reasonableness can arguably be thought of as a form\nof pure procedural justice (Rawls 1971) because we lack prior\nconsensus on the fine-grained principles needed to resolve disputes\nabout these resource allocation issues, though we may arrive at\nmutually acceptable justifications through deliberation about specific\ncases. It differs from gambling, Rawls\u2019s example of a case of\npure procedural justice, in two ways. First, the appeal to process is\nconstrained by some prior moral principles. For example, an outcome\nshould not contradict what fair equality of opportunity requires by\ndiscriminating against some subgroup by race or gender. A local\ndecision-making body could not engage in gender or race bias and\nconsider that a fair outcome. One might claim that the same constraint\napplies to the gambling case: if only whites and no blacks were\nallowed to gamble, then the outcome of a spin of a fair roulette wheel\nwould also not be fair\u2014though some might reply this is a\nconstraint on who plays the game, not on whether we view the outcome\nof the spin of a fairly balanced wheel as fair outcome. Second, we can\nimagine philosophical reasoning persuading us to adopt a principle\nthat renders the appeal to a fair process unnecessary, but we cannot\nimagine such a philosophical \u201cproof\u201d of the fairness of a\ngambling outcome that would lead us to think the spin of a fair\nroulette wheel or a throw of a properly balanced die can be rendered\nunnecessary in the same way. Though fair equality or opportunity,\nincluding non-discrimination, constrains acceptable outcomes of fair\nprocess, it is too general an idea to settle what counts as an\nacceptable outcome. That requires agreement, in general by a range of\nstakeholders, on reasons for thinking an allocation is an acceptable\nway to meet needs fairly and so protect opportunity for those\ninvolved. The point behind insisting on what we call the\n\u201crelevance\u201d condition is to search for mutually\njustifiable reasons for thinking that a particular resource allocation\nis an acceptable way to aim at fair equality of opportunity. The\ncondition takes us beyond mere consistency with fair equality of\nopportunity since that principle does not determine what to do in the\nface of disagreements about priorities, aggregation, and other\nproblems.\n\nThe argument for universal access sketched earlier specifically\nembraces Rawls\u2019s fair equality of opportunity principle. It is\nworth remarking that the variations on this argument might retain\nsteps 1\u20133 but modify the principle that is appealed to in 4,\nprovided there is a reasonable connection between any substituted\nprinciple and the central observation in 3, that health affects the\nopportunity range open to people. For example, Sen has argued that the\nappropriate target of concerns about equality is a space of\ncapabilities, thought of as functionings we can choose to exercise. A\nprinciple requiring us to protect the range of capabilities for people\n(either equally or to some sufficient level) would also provide a\nbasis for keeping people functioning normally through universal access\nto interventions that reduce the health risks to them or that treat\nthem for departures from normal functioning. Though Sen has not\ndeveloped this account into a theory of justice that articulates a set\nof principles of justice, the central point here is that a concern to\nprotect a space of functionings we can choose to exercise is\nequivalent to the focus of the earlier argument on protecting\nopportunities that it is reasonable for people to exercise (Daniels\n2010).\n\nA third alternative version of the earlier argument might (in 4)\ninvoke a principle assuring equal opportunity for welfare or advantage\n(Arneson 1988; Cohen 1989), a view that later came to be called\n\u201cluck egalitarianism.\u201d Arguably, such a principle would\nalso support a universal access system that included a broad range of\npreventive and treatment services. This particular principle, however,\nwill differ in terms of what is covered from the opportunity-based\naccount described earlier for it more explicitly leaves room to\nexclude coverage for conditions for which an individual is\nsubstantively responsible. It says we do not owe each other assistance\nor compensation for bad \u201coption\u201d luck in the way we do for\nbad \u201cbrute\u201d luck. At the same time, it might include\naccess to services that correct for some disadvantages (e.g. lower\nmanual dexterity or lower intelligence) that might be considered\nnormal functioning by the account sketched earlier. Still, this is a\nuniversal access system, even if it excludes coverage for conditions\nfor which society holds individuals responsible (see Daniels 2011).\nNevertheless, some luck egalitarians reject the appeal to opportunity\nproposed in the account sketched here (Segall 2010).\n",
