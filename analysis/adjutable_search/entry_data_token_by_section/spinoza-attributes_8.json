More recently, Michael Della Rocca as been\nadvocating a more idealistic interpretation of the attributes, which\nshares certain important features with the subjectivist camp. The\nother, which has become the standard, is the \u201cobjective\u201d\ninterpretation. These two principal avenues stem from some important\nambiguities in the definition of \u201cattribute\u201d: \u201cBy\nattribute I understand what the intellect perceives of substance as\nconstituting its essence\u201d\n (1D4).[12]\n The first term that is ambiguous is \u201cintellect,\u201d since it\ncan refer either to the finite intellect or the infinite one (cf.\ndiagram in Section 1). The second important ambiguity lies in the\nLatin term tanquam, since it can mean either \u201cas if,\nbut not in fact,\u201d or \u201cas in fact.\u201d The definition\ncan therefore be read, either as stating that attributes are what the\nintellect perceives of substance as constituting its actual\nessence, or that attributes are what the intellect perceives only\nas if they are what constitute the essence but are not what\nin fact constitutes it or them. The subjectivists accordingly claim\nthat attributes are what the finite intellect perceives of substance\nas if constituting its essence. The objectivists, by and\nlarge, instead claim that it is the infinite intellect that perceives\nthe attribute as in fact constituting the essence of\nsubstance. In the following sections the different interpretative\noptions are explained a grosso modo. The ways in which the\ndifferent interpretative avenues affect other Spinozistic doctrines\nare discussed in Sections 1.9.1\u20131.9.4.\n1.8.1 Subjective Interpretations\n\nAs is well known, Hegel, in various respects, considered himself to be\nmodifying Spinoza\u2019s doctrine (\u201cto be a follower of Spinoza\nis the essential commencement of all philosophy\u201d) and his\ninterpretation of Spinoza was extremely influential. In\nhis Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Hegel says that\nwhat has utmost reality for Spinoza is the absolute (or the infinite\nsubstance) and that anything else (finite modes, in particular) are\nways of negating this absolute. He goes on to explain that the\nunderstanding [or \u201cintellect\u201d] grasps the reality of\nsubstance through attributes, but \u201cit is only reality in view of\nthe understanding.\u201d He stresses that understanding in terms of\nattributes is due to the nature of the understanding and not because\nof the nature of the absolute (or the infinite substance) as such. It\nis clear that he considers the understanding to be the understanding\nof finite minds, because he goes on to explain that Spinoza\u2019s\nclaim that there are \u201cinfinite attributes\u201d has to be\ninterpreted as \u201cinfinite in character\u201d and not in number\nand that there are only the two attributes known to finite\nminds\u2014Thought and Extension.\n\nWhat is referred to in the literature as the subjectivist reading,\nfollowing Hegel, holds that the intellect perceiving the attributes is\nthe finite intellect and that the attributes are projections of the\nfinite mind onto the infinite substance which it cannot fully\ncomprehend. In other words, according to the subjectivist\ninterpretation, the definition of attribute states that attributes are\nwhat the finite intellect perceives of substance as if (but not in\nfact) constituting its essence. In contrast, the objectivist\nreading takes the intellect in question to be the infinite one, and\nthe tanquam to mean \u201cas in fact,\u201d and so it read\nthe definition as claiming that attributes are what the infinite\nintellect perceives of substance as (in fact) constituting\nits essence. Wolfson summarizes the difference between the two\npositions thus:\n\nAccording to the former interpretation [subjectivism], to be perceived\nby the mind means to be invented by the mind, for of\nthemselves the attributes have no independent existence at all but are\nidentical with the essence of the substance. According to the latter\ninterpretation [objectivism], to be perceived by the mind means only\nto be discovered by the mind, for even of themselves the\nattributes have independent existence in the essence of substance\n(Wolfson, 1934, 146).\n\n\nOne of the motivations behind Wolfson\u2019s view is that he\nconsiders Spinoza to be the last of the medieval Jewish rationalists,\nand in following with that tradition, Spinoza locates all multiplicity\nnot in the infinite substance (God), but rather in the human mind.\nThat is, the fact that God has multiple attributes is explained not by\nhis having multiple essences, natures, or aspects, but rather because\nof the nature of the human mind. This is based on the conviction that\nGod\u2019s true nature is simple and any multiplicity is merely\napparent but not real. It is because of the limitations of the finite\nmind that it attributes multiplicity to the infinite substance, when\nin reality the infinite substance is simple. In this view there is a\ngap between the attributes and the infinite substance. The infinite\nsubstance as it is in itself, so to speak, is unknowable to the finite\nmind. With respect to the \u201creal distinction,\u201d the\ndistinction between the attributes in this view is grounded in the\ndifferent ways the finite mind has of conceiving the infinite\nsubstance. That is, the distinction between the attributes is not\nbased on the nature of the infinite substance itself, but it reveals,\nin a way, something about the nature of finite perception. It is in\nthese terms that the \u201creality\u201d of the distinction is to be\nunderstood, i.e., as if but not in fact.\n1.8.1.1 Objections to Subjectivism \n\nTwo main objections have been brought forth against the subjectivist\ninterpretation. These are considered by most commentators to be\nforceful enough for rejecting subjectivism as a serious contender for\na satisfying interpretation of Spinoza\u2019s theory of attributes.\nThe first objection to subjectivism is that, finite minds can never\nhave true knowledge of God, but only knowledge \u201cas if.\u201d\nAll knowledge is rendered illusory. The reason for this is quite\nclear. In the subjectivist interpretation the attributes are\nprojections of the finite mind, therefore the finite mind can never\ncome to know the infinite substance as it is in itself. This seems to\ncontradict Spinoza\u2019s claim that the finite mind can have\nadequate, that is, perfect knowledge of God\u2019s essence (2P47).\nThe second objection is that this interpretation seems irreconcilable\nwith those places in the text where Spinoza identifies the attributes\nand God (cf. 1P4, 1P19 and 1P20Cor.). Again, as projections of the\nfinite intellect, the attributes do not properly pertain to the\nsubstance, and therefore cannot be identical to it. For these reasons,\namong others, the subjective interpretation (understood in these\nterms) has fallen out of\n favor.[13]\n Michael Della Rocca, however, has been advocating more recently that\nattributes (and diversity more generally), are mind-dependent yet not\nillusory. Thus he aims to overcome some of the traditional objections\nto subjectivism (primarily \u201cillusory knowledge\u201d\nobjections) while insisting on the mind-dependent status of\nattributes. He takes the mind-dependant nature of diversity (be it of\nattribute or modes) to be an inevitable consequence of Spinoza\u2019s\nadoption of the Principle of Sufficient Reason (cf. Della Rocca,\n2012).\n1.8.2 Objective Interpretations\n\nIn light of these kinds of criticisms to the subjectivist\ninterpretation, commentators have turned towards what are known as\n\u201cobjectivist\u201d accounts. Although the details of these\naccounts are quite diverse, there are a few key elements they\nshare\u2014all related to the fact that they do not wish to be\nsubjectivist. The first of these characteristics is that they hold\nthat knowledge in the system cannot be illusory. That is, knowledge\nthrough attributes must yield true, or adequate, knowledge. One way to\ndo this is to claim that it is the infinite intellect that perceives\nthe attributes, and so knowledge through attributes is the kind of\nknowledge the infinite intellect has, and therefore is not illusory\n(e.g. Bennett, 1984, 147; Delahunty, 1985, 116; Della Rocca 1996, 157;\nHaserot, 1972, 32\u201335). Therefore, the tanquam in the\ndefinition is to be read \u201cas in fact\u201d and not \u201cas\nif.\u201d\n\nAs opposed to subjectivism, which does not emphasize the\n\u201creality\u201d of the distinction between the attributes, or\nrather, does not ground the distinction in the nature of the infinite\nsubstance, objectivist interpretations place ontological weight on the\n\u201creal distinction\u201d between the attributes. In other words,\nfor the multiplicity to have a certain reality and not be illusory, it\nmust somehow be grounded not in the perceiver but in the thing\nperceived, namely, the infinite substance. The danger of this kind of\ninterpretation is that if the distinction is stressed too strongly,\nthe unity of the substance is lost. If the infinite substance has\n\u201creally distinct\u201d attributes, and this distinction is\ngrounded in, say, distinct natures or essences of the infinite\nsubstance, then there has to be an explanation of how a multiplicity\nof natures or essences can be united to form one substance. (This\nissue is addressed in further detail in Section 1.9.4 as it emerges in\nthe discussion of the nature of the union of mind and body).\n\nAny interpretation of Spinoza must characterize the relation between\nany given attribute and the substance. As mentioned, in the\nsubjectivist account there is a problematic gap between the substance\nand any given attribute. The alternative is to deny this gap. For\nexample, Bennett claims the following:\n\nI think that here [Ep. 9] he is saying that substance differs from\nattribute only by the difference between a substance and an adjectival\npresentation of the very same content. If we look for how that\nwhich is extended (substance) differs from extension\n(attribute), we find that it consists only in the notion of that\nwhich has\u2026 extension or thought or whatever; and that,\nSpinoza thinks, adds nothing to the conceptual content of\nextension, but merely marks something about how the content\nis logically structured. As I did in \u00a712.7, he is rejecting the\nview that a property bearer is an item whose nature qualifies it to\nhave properties, in favour of the view that the notion of a property\nbearer, of a thing which\u2026, is a bit of formal apparatus,\nsomething which organizes conceptual content without adding to it.\nAccording to this view, there is an emptiness about the difference\nbetween substance and attribute (Bennett, 1984, 62\u201363).\n\n\nAlthough Bennett claims there is an emptiness about the distinction\nbetween the two, he does not consider it an absolute identity either.\nHe finds an identity claim to be irreconcilable with the claim that\nattributes are really distinct. Della Rocca has suggested\nintentionality as a way of denying the gap and treats \u201c\u2026\nis extended\u201d and \u201c\u2026 is thinking\u201d as\nreferentially opaque. In other words, what is being picked out by the\ninfinite intellect in either instance is the same, but the way in\nwhich it is picked out is different. Yet another way of denying the\ngap is to claim, along with Descartes, that the distinction between an\nattribute and the substance is only a rational distinction. That is,\nin reality there is no distinction, but in the finite mind we\ncan separate, contra natura, the attribute from the\nsubstance. Or in other words, the finite mind can abstract the\nattribute from the substance, but in reality they are not\nseparated. This type of view must be supplemented by an account, then,\nof what is meant by the \u201creal distinction\u201d among the\nattributes.\n1.9 Implications of the Various Readings on Other Spinozistic Doctrines\n1.9.1 Number of Attributes\n\nAlthough Spinoza claims that there are infinite attributes, a question\narises as to how many there are, because \u201cinfinity\u201d may\nnot necessarily refer to numeric\n infinity.[14]\n Bennett, among others, has made the case that infinity in early\nmodern philosophy means totality (Bennett, 1984, 75\u201379).\nSpinoza\u2019s claims, then, that the infinite substance has infinite\nattributes can be understood as the claim that the infinite substance\nhas all the attributes there are to be\n had.[15]\n This is consistent with there being, say, only the two known\nattributes. There are sections in the text, on the other hand, that\nseem to suggest that infinity means a numerical infinity, and thus the\ninfinite substance has as attributes Thought and Extension, as well as\ninfinitely many other unknown attributes. The places used as evidence\nfor those wishing to claim there are more than two attributes are the\nfollowing:\n\n\n1D6: By God I understand a being absolutely infinite, that is, a\nsubstance consisting of an infinity of attributes, of which each one\nexpresses an eternal and infinite essence.\n\nExp.: I say absolutely infinite, not infinite in its own kind; for if\nsomething is only infinite in its own kind, we can deny infinite\nattributes of it; but if something is absolutely infinite, whatever\nexpresses essence and involves no negation pertains to its\nessence.\n\n2P7Schol: Therefore whether we conceive Nature under the attribute of\nExtension, or the attribute of Thought, or any other attribute, we\nshall find one and the same order, or one and the same connection of\ncauses, that is the same things follow one another.\n\nLetter 56: To your [Hugo Boxel] question as to whether I have as clear\nan idea of God as of a triangle, I reply in the affirmative. But if\nyou ask me whether I have as clear a mental image of God as of a\ntriangle, I reply in the negative. We cannot imagine God, but we can\napprehend him by the intellect. Here it should also be observed that I\ndo not claim to have complete knowledge of God, but that I do\nunderstand some of his attributes\u2014not indeed all of them, or the\ngreater part\u2014and it is certain that my ignorance of very many\nattributes does not prevent me from having knowledge of some of them.\nWhen I was studying Euclid\u2019s Elements, I understood\nearly on that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right\nangles, and I clearly perceived this property of a triangle although I\nwas ignorant of many others.\n\n\nThis issue can be linked to the previous discussion regarding the\nambiguities in the definition of attribute, although this is not\nalways done. If one holds that it is the infinite intellect that is\ndoing the relevant perceiving, there seems to be no reason to limit\nthe number of attributes it perceives. Conversely, it might be claimed\nthat if the infinite intellect perceives only two attributes, there\nmust be a sufficient reason why there are only two, and why they are\nThought and Extension and not other attributes. If, on the other hand,\none holds that it is the finite intellect that conceives the\nattributes, and it only conceives Thought and Extension, then these\nare the only two attributes there are. In the literature, however,\nthis line of reasoning is not always followed, and examples can be\nfound of interpreters who hold that it is the infinite intellect that\ndoes the perceiving, but that there need not be more than two\nattributes (Bennett, 1984, 75\u201376). At the same time, there are\ninterpreters who claim it is the finite intellect that perceives the\nattributes while there are infinitely many attributes (Wolfson, 1934,\n226). How many attributes there are affects how one reads another\ncentral doctrine in Spinoza\u2019s metaphysics, such as 2P7 and\n2P7Schol, to which we turn next.\n1.9.2 The Metaphysical Structure of 2P7 and its Scholium\n\nA crucial role in Spinoza\u2019s system is played by 2P7 and its\nscholium, since they lay the ground for solving, or rather dissolving,\nthe mind\u2013body problem. Therefore, the understanding of the\nnature of the union of mind and body depends on one\u2019s\ninterpretation of Spinoza\u2019s theory of attributes and 2P7 and its\nscholium in particular. (For a discussion of the issues regarding the\nunion of Mind and Body, see Section 1.9.4). The interpretation of the\nmetaphysical structure of what is expressed in 2P7 and its scholium is\naffected greatly by the number of attributes one believes there are in\nSpinoza\u2019s system and how one understands the relation between\nthe attributes and the substance. The general description of 2P7 and\nits scholium is discussed above in Section 1.6.\n\n2P7 and its scholium can be understood in very different ways. In what\nfollows three types of interpretive directions are described. This is\nnot meant to be exhaustive by any means, but it will provide a sense\nof the kinds of options that have been offered by commentators. Let us\nbegin with the simplest option first. If one holds that there are only\ntwo attributes, Thought and Extension, the metaphysical structure of\n2P7 and its scholium is quite straightforward. Every mode under the\nattribute of Thought is associated with a mode in Extension, and\nvice versa and the relations between modes in one attribute\nare mirrored in the other. Those that hold this kind of view must, of\ncourse, provide a convincing argument to the effect that there are\nonly two attributes.\n\nHowever, if one takes there to be more than two attributes, the\nstructure gets quite a bit more complex. One option that has been\nadvanced is that Thought is a special attribute and encompasses ideas\nof all the modes in all the other attributes (Cf. for example Curley,\n1969, 146; and more recently, Melamed, 2009, Chapters 1\u20132).\nThought turns out to be \u201cspecial\u201d in this kind of\ninterpretation because there are many more modes (ideas) or facets of\nmodes in Thought than there are under any other attribute. Another way\nof expressing this is by saying that 2P7 is not a biconditional. The\nrequirement of an associated mode goes only in one direction from any\nmode in any attribute to a mode in Thought. The burden on this type of\nview is that it must account for the favoring of Thought over the\nother attributes, and perhaps also for the relation between all the\nnon-Thought modes in the other attributes.\n\nAnother option (or class of options) that is available is to claim\nthat attributes come in pairs: an object-like attribute coupled with a\nthought-like attribute (Curley entertains this option as well; Curley,\n1969, 146). Under this type of interpretation we would get Thought and\nExtension following the structure of the first alternative, that is,\neach idea in Thought is associated with (one and the same) a mode in\nExtension. Taking there to be more than just two attributes, we also\nget Thoughtx coupled with Extensionx in which\neach ideax is one and the same as bodyx under\nExtensionx, and Thoughty coupled with\nExtensiony, and so on. Letter 66 provides some support for\nthis view. This kind of account has to be supplemented, of course,\nwith an account of the relations among these Thought-like /\nExtension-like pairs of attributes.\n1.9.3 The Nature of the Identification of Substance and the Attributes\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Spinoza identifies God, or the infinite\nsubstance with the attributes (1P4, 1P19 and 1P20Cor.). The nature of\nthis identification is also affected by one\u2019s interpretative\nstance regarding the attributes. The traditional subjectivist view,\nsince it claims that the attributes are a projection of the finite\nmind onto the substance, cannot hold this identification to be strict.\nObjectivist views, which stress the distinctness of attributes, also\ncannot accept these claims literally (E.g., Bennett, 1984, 64; Curley,\n1988, 13; Gueroult, 1968, 50). The reason for this is as follows: if\nthe substance is strictly identical to any one of its attributes, then\nattributes will be identical to each other (by transitivity), and\ntherefore no longer distinct, as Spinoza claims. Different objectivist\ninterpretations address this issue differently. Curley, for example,\nholds that the identity is not one that holds between any given\nattribute and the substance, but rather between the totality of the\nattributes and the substance (Curley, 1988, 30). Bennett, on the other\nhand, believes Spinoza is simply overstating the case (Bennett, 1984,\n64).\n\nThis identity can be understood strictly if the distinction between\nthe attributes and the substance is taken to be only rationally\ndistinct, that is identical in reality, and at the same time\ntaking the distinction between attributes to be only epistemological\nand not ontological.\n1.9.4 The Nature of the Union of Mind and Body\n\nAnother doctrine that is heavily affected by how one understands the\nattributes is the union of mind and body. For Descartes, the issue was\nhow to unite two really distinct created substances\u2014uniting\nminds with bodies. Descartes\u2019 reply is that God unites these two\nsubstances, and we have tools by which to recognize that we are united\nin this way, i.e., sensory experience (Meditation Six).\nSpinoza, of course, cannot allude to God as creator to unite minds and\nbodies, since what is being united are not created substances\nbut finite modes. The possible problem can be\narticulated as follows: How can Spinoza claim, on the one hand, that\nthere are modes of really distinct attributes, e.g., my mind and my\nbody, and therefore there is a real distinction between my mind and my\nbody, and, on the other, claim in the Scholium to 2P7 that my mind and\nbody are one and the same?\n\nThis problem which arises for the objectivist interpretations has been\naddressed in a variety of ways. It is worth noting that this problem\ndoes not arise for subjectivist views. This possible tension in\nSpinoza does not present itself for the subjectivists, since they do\nnot claim that the \u201creal distinction\u201d between the\nattributes has ontological weight. That is, there are no two things\nthat have to be united. Commentators wishing to stress the\n\u201cdistinctness\u201d of the attributes find themselves having to\nexplain the sense in which Spinoza can mean that the mind and the body\nare \u201cone and the same.\u201d A common strategy among\ncommentators has been to appeal to a structure that is\nattribute-neutral in order to account for the unity. To better\nunderstand this issue it is useful to consider a few examples.\n\nOne important example is Bennett, who claims that the unity is to be\nunderstood as a unity of properties, but not of the modes\nthemselves:\n\n\u2026his [Spinoza\u2019s] thesis about the identity of physical\nand mental particulars is really about the identity of properties. He\ncannot be saying that physical P1=mental\nM1; that is impossible because they belong to\ndifferent attributes. His thesis is rather that if\nP1 is systematically linked with\nM1, then P1 is\nextension\u2014and\u2014F for some differentia F\nsuch that M1 is\nthought\u2014and\u2014F. What it takes for an extended\nworld to contain my body is exactly what it takes for a thinking world\nto contain my mind (Bennett, 1984, 141)\n\n\nThat is, Bennett thinks that there is some trans-attribute feature\n(what he calls \u201cdifferentia F\u201d) such that it can\nbe added to Extension to get extended-F, and added it to\nThought to get thinking-F. Bennett admits that nothing like\nthis is found anywhere in the text, but he believes that this way we\ncan make sense of Spinoza\u2019s holding that the attributes are\n\u201creally distinct\u201d from each other and, at the same time,\nthat thinking-F and extended-F are one and the\nsame.\n\nDella Rocca, while holding a view different from that of Bennett\nregarding Spinoza\u2019s theory of attributes, also finds himself\nhaving to account in some way for the unity of mind and body, and so\nhe suggests that modes are said to be numerically identical when they\nshare all of their neutral properties, where \u201cneutral\nproperties\u201d are those properties which do not involve being\nthought under any particular attributes. This is contrasted with\n\u201cintentional properties\u201d which are attribute-dependent\nsuch as \u201cbeing of a certain volume.\u201d As an example of a\nneutral property, Della Rocca offers \u201chaving five immediate\neffects.\u201d He then claims that if modes share all of their\nneutral properties, they are identical (that is, one and the same).\nTherefore, since my mind and my body share all of their neutral\nproperties, they are identical (Della Rocca, 1996, 133\u201338).\n\nThe final example that shall be considered is Gueroult\u2019s\ninterpretation. Gueroult, in order to account for the professed\nidentity between modes of different attributes in 2P7 and its\nscholium, considers 1P28 which states:\n\nEvery singular thing, or any thing which is finite and has a\ndeterminate existence, can neither exist nor be determined to produce\nan effect unless it is determined to exist and produce an effect by\nanother cause, which is also finite and has a determinate existence;\nand again, this cause also can neither exist nor be determined to\nproduce an effect unless it is determined to exist and produce an\neffect by another, which is also finite and has a determinate\nexistence, and so on, to infinity.\n\n\nTo explain this proposition, Gueroult draws a distinction between\n\u201cmodes of substance\u201d and \u201cmodes of\nattributes.\u201d The claim is that 1P28 treats only modes of\nsubstance and not attributes, and is therefore unique. In other words,\nthe identity is then understood in reference to \u201cmodes of\nsubstance\u201d and not \u201cmodes of attributes\u201d (Gueroult,\n1968, 338\u201339). Again, we see an attribute-independent\nstructure\u2014the chain of modes of substance\u2014that is meant to\naccount for the \u201cone and the sameness\u201d of modes of\ndifferent attributes.\n\nIt has been pointed out, however, that this type of solution is not\nwithout serious problems (Shein, 2009). Briefly, the issue is as\nfollows: The main reason for rejecting the subjectivist view is that\nin that type of interpretation, God, as he is in himself, remains\nunknowable, and this conflicts with Spinoza\u2019s view that adequate\nknowledge is possible. However, as Spinoza makes clear in 1P10Schol,\nnature must be conceived under attributes. In light of this, an\nattribute-independent structure, by its very nature as\n\u201cattribute-independent,\u201d is unknowable as well. Therefore,\nin this view, knowledge of the union or the nature of the identity\nbetween mind and body, is in principle unknowable, and, in that\nrespect, does not provide any advantage over subjectivist views.\n\nAn alternative mentioned above that has been suggested is to deny the\ngap between the attributes and the substance by claiming that, along\nwith Descartes, Spinoza holds there to be a rational distinction\nbetween them, that is, in reality they are identical (Shein,\n2009). This avoids the kind of problems that are raised for the\nsubjectivist view, since, in this interpretation to know the\nattributes is to know the substance. Since in this view the attributes\nare only rationally distinct from the substance, the \u201creal\ndistinction\u201d between the attributes, that Spinoza states in\n1P10Schol, is understood as being only an epistemological claim, as he\nstates in the text\u2014\u201ci.e., one may be conceived without the\nother\u201d (1P10Schol). That is, it does not carry additional\nontological weight as the objectivists hold. This avoids having to\nimpose onto the Spinozistic system an attribute-independent structure\nto account for the unity which does not seem to fit with his\nepistemology.\n2. Attributes in the Short Treatise\n\nIn the Short Treatise Spinoza develops ideas that will come\nto a full articulation later on in the Ethics, such as the\nidea that, strictly speaking, there are only two attributes through\nwhich we can properly come to have knowledge of God\u2014Thought and\nExtension. However, unlike in the Ethics, he does not simply\ndismiss the more traditional attributes such as omnipotence,\neternality, immutability, and infinity. To maintain some sense of\nthese traditional divine attributes, Spinoza explains that they are\nnot attributes strictly speaking, but rather propria of God.\nThis is stated first clearly in the first footnote to Chapter III\n(\u201cHow God is the Cause of All Things\u201d):\n\nThe following are called Propria because they are nothing but\nAdjectives which cannot be understood without their\nSubstantives. I.e., without them God would indeed not be God;\nbut still, he is not God through them, for they do not make known\nanything substantial, and it is only through what is substantial that\nGod exists.\n\n\nSpinoza then, is distinguishing between that which gives us knowledge\nof God, or better yet, through which God can be known\u2014Thought\nand Extension\u2014and things that can be said of God, that is,\nadjectival, but give us no knowledge\u2014what he terms\npropria. This is explained most explicitly in Chapter VII of\nthe Short Treatise. The difference Spinoza wishes to draw\nbetween these is that although these traditional divine attributes can\nbe said of God, they do not teach us anything about what God is really\nlike. An analysis of these traditional attributes (propria)\nshows them either to be said of God when considering all of the\nattributes or to be only modes of attributes. For example, Spinoza\nclaims that when statements such as that \u201cGod is one,\u201d\n\u201ceternal\u201d and \u201cimmutable\u201d are said of God,\nthey are said \u201cin consideration of all his attributes.\u201d On\nthe other hand, something like \u201comniscience\u201d is only a\nmode of an attribute, since it is only said of God when he is\nconceived through, or considered under, the attribute of Thought. That\nis, only when God is thought of as a thinking thing, can he be said to\nbe omniscient. Similarly, when God is said to be\n\u201comnipresent,\u201d it is only when he is conceived of through\nExtension. In the Ethics though, Spinoza does away with the\ntalk of propria and does not accord them really any status as\nsuch.\n3. Conclusion\n\nWith the collapse of the divide between created substances and the\ninfinite substance, attributes play a new role for Spinoza;\ntraditional divine attributes are eliminated while attributes\ntraditionally associated with created substances (Extension in\nparticular) are attributed to the infinite substance. Furthermore,\nwith the elimination of this divide and the establishment of the\ninfinite substance as the only substance, Spinoza hopes that\nattributes account for variety in the substance without jeopardizing\nits unity. All interpreters and readers of Spinoza are forced to\nwrestle with making sense of this double role since it sits at the\nvery core of his metaphysics. It is vital to realize that this\nendeavor is necessarily and beautifully linked to other fundamental\naspects of Spinoza\u2019s metaphysics such as the \u201creal\ndistinction\u201d between the attributes, the proclaimed identity of\nthe substance and its attributes, the nature of the conceiving\nintellect in the definition of \u2018attribute\u2019, the nature of\nthis intellect\u2019s conceptions (illusory or not), the number of\nattributes, the structure of 2P7 and its scholium, and finally the\nnature of the union of mind and body. These inter-connections are a\nreflection of the fully systematic nature of Spinoza\u2019s\nmetaphysics.",
