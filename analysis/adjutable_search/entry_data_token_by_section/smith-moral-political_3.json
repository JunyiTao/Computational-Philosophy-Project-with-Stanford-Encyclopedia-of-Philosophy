Objections to Smith\u2019s Moral Philosophy\n\nSmith\u2019s moral theory has been accused of three major failings.\nFirst, it offers us no clear procedure for deciding which actions we\nshould take in specific circumstances, no guidelines for how we can\ntell, in specific cases, what the impartial spectator has to say.\nSecond, the impartial spectator seems too enmeshed in the attitudes\nand interests of the society in which it develops for it to be free of\nthat society\u2019s biases, or to help us care impartially for all\nhuman beings. And third, even if Smith\u2019s analysis of moral\nclaims is correct, even if it is true that moral judgments in ordinary\nlife consist in attempts to express how an impartial spectator would\nfeel about our conduct, it remains unclear what justifies these\njudgments. Why should we heed the demands of the impartial\nspectator?\n\nSmith would probably dismiss the first of these objections, as based\non an erroneous notion of what moral philosophy ought to do. Moral\nphilosophy can deepen our love for virtue, refine our understanding of\nthe virtues, and enrich our understanding of ourselves, all of which\ncan conduce to a firmer moral disposition and to a wiser, more careful\napproach to moral decisions, but it cannot and should not replace the\ncommon-life processes by which we actually make those decisions.\nPhilosophy is an abstract, intellectual, and solitary activity, while\nmoral decision-making is and should be concrete, driven by emotion as\nmuch as by the intellect, and shaped by our interactions with the\npeople affected by our actions.\n\nThe second and third objections constitute what we might call a\ntribalist or relativist and a skeptical challenge. The tribalist sees\nno reason to extend moral sentiments or modes of judgment to people\noutside his society, and no reason to criticize the basic structures\nof moral sentiment in his society. He thereby seems to miss a basic\nfeature of moral demands. But where is the room for a universalist\nmorality in Smith\u2019s account? Since we construct the impartial\nspectator within us out of attitudes in the society around us, how can\nthat spectator reach beyond our society sufficiently to achieve a\nsensitive and impartial concern for members of other societies, and to\nrecognize where our society\u2019s sentiments are biased or\ncorrupt?\n\nThe skeptic represents a yet deeper problem. Smith says that when we\nissue a moral judgment, of others or of ourselves, we express the\nrelationship of one set of sentiments\u2014the cooler, more\nreflective sentiments characteristic of a spectator\u2014to another.\nThis seems a plausible account of what we actually do, when judging\nmorally; it captures nicely the \u201cfeel\u201d of ordinary moral\njudgments. But does it give us reason to heed such judgments? Does it\nexplain the normativity of moral judgments, our sense that we ought to\nlisten to them?\n\nSmith clearly rejects any tribal limit to the reach of moral demands.\nHe adopts the Stoic view that each person is \u201cfirst and\nprincipally recommended [by nature] to his own care\u201d (TMS 219),\nand that we similarly care more about members of our own society than\nabout people far away from us (139\u201340, 227\u20138). At the same\ntime, however\u2014also like the Stoics\u2014he thinks that our\nmoral feelings extend, if to a lesser degree, to all rational and\nsensible beings: \u201cour good-will is circumscribed by no boundary,\nbut may embrace the immensity of the universe\u201d (235). Indeed, he\nregards accepting harm to one\u2019s local community, if that is\nnecessary for the good of the universe, as a mark of the highest\nwisdom and virtue (235\u20136). As Amartya Sen has stressed, Smith\nalso wants us to evaluate our conduct from the perspective of any\nhuman being anywhere, not just a member of our own society. Sen quotes\na passage in TMS in which Smith says that we \u201cendeavour to\nexamine our own conduct as we imagine any other fair and\nimpartial spectator would imagine it\u201d (110), arguing that it\nimplies we should seek to be informed by the views of people far\noutside our cultural communities. \u201cThe need to invoke how things\nwould look to \u2018any other fair and impartial\nspectator,\u2019\u201d says Sen, \u201cis a requirement that can\nbring in judgments that would be made by disinterested people from\nother societies as well\u201d (Sen 2009: 125). And Smith certainly\ndid aspire to provide such a standard of moral judgment, a structure\nfor morality that reaches out across national and cultural\nborders.\n\nBut is Smith\u2019s impartial spectator capable of doing this?\nConsider two of its features. First, it uses sentiments rather than\nreason as the basis of its judgments. It is not like Roderick\nFirth\u2019s ideal observer, dispassionately watching people from\nabove the emotional fray (Firth 1952). Rather, Smith follows Hutcheson\nand Hume in tracing moral judgment, ultimately, to feelings. The\nimpartial spectator is supposed to be free of partial\nfeelings\u2014feelings that depend on a stake it might have\nin a dispute, or on blind favoritism or dislike for one party or the\nother\u2014but it is not supposed to be free of feelings altogether,\nnor to reach for a principle it might derive from reason alone,\nindependent of feeling (see Raphael 2007, chapter 6). But our feelings\nare notoriously shaped by our societies, and it is not clear how a\ndevice that depends on feelings could correct for biases built into\nthem. \n\nSecond, the impartial spectator develops within us as part of our\nefforts to align our feelings with those of the people immediately\naround us. The \u201cchief part of human happiness,\u201d for Smith,\ncomes from the consciousness that we are \u201cbeloved\u201d (TMS\n41), but that is not possible unless our feelings, and the actions we\ntake on those feelings, meet with other people\u2019s approval. The\nsearch for feelings we can share\u2014for mutual sympathy\u2014is a\nbasic human drive, and it leads among other things to the rise of\nmorality. Of course, that eventually means that we correct the modes\nof approval of people around us for bias and misinformation; we seek\nthe judgment of an impartial spectator within rather than partial\nspectators without. But Smith never suggests that this impartial\nspectator uses different methods of judging, appeals to\ndifferent sorts of norms, than our neighbors do. It arises out of the\nactual process of moral judgment around us, and we heed it as part of\nour drive to find a harmony of feelings with our actual neighbors. It\nis very unlikely, then, to use a method of judging radically unlike\nthose of our actual neighbors, or perceive, let alone correct for, a\nsystematic bias in the sentiments of our society. If sentiments of\ncondescension or dislike toward poor people, or black people, or gay\npeople, pervade our society, then there is every reason to expect that\nmany of us, especially in privileged groups, will build an impartial\nspectator within ourselves that shares those biases rather than rising\nabove them. \n\nThese are the sorts of considerations that led Smith himself to worry\nabout the danger that \u201cestablished custom\u201d can distort\nmoral judgment (TMS 210), and that nature may lead people, foolishly\nand unjustly, to admire the rich and despise the poor (50\u201362).\nSmith also worried that political faction and religious fanaticism can\n\u201cpervert\u201d our moral feelings (155\u20136, 176\u20137),\nand did not suggest ways to correct for that danger. It is unclear how\nhis moral theory might supply such a corrective.\n\nMoreover, much that is attractive about Smith\u2019s theory is bound\nup with this limitation; his relativistic tendencies are not a mere\nmistake but a consequence of the structure of his theory. The absence\nof transcendental principles in favor of judgments rooted in our\neveryday sentiments, the view of individuals as aiming, by way of\nmorality, for emotional harmony with their neighbors, the\npsychological insight of his view of moral development\u2014all these\nthings go together with a picture on which we are deeply shaped by our\nlocal societies in the way we make moral judgments, and can turn those\njudgments on our society only with difficulty. It has been suggested\nthat Smith thought better information about the lives of poor people\ncould help well-off people judge the poor more favorably (Fleischacker\n2004, chapter 10), and perhaps he thought that slavery and other\ninjustices could likewise be overturned by better information:\ninformation enabling people to project themselves into the lives of\nslaves, and other victims of injustice, and thereby to sympathize with\nthem. Sometimes Smith also drops proto-Kantian hints that a concern\nfor the equal worth of every human being lies at the basis of all\nmoral sentiments (TMS 90, 107, 137), and Stephen Darwall and Remy\nDebes have brought out a latent egalitarianism in the structure of\nSmith\u2019s moral theory that could be turned against inegalitarian\nsocial institutions (Darwall 1999; Debes 2012). But even a commitment\nto the equal worth of every human being can be interpreted in ways\nthat support local biases\u2014Kant, notoriously, maintained racist\nand sexist views long after coming up with his arguments for equal\nworth\u2014and Smith in any case says little to justify his\negalitarian tendencies. So it must be admitted that the tribalist\nchallenge brings out a weakness in Smith\u2019s theory, and cannot\neasily be answered without sacrificing some of its central elements.\n(For more on these issues, see Forman-Barzilai 2010).\n\nSmith does better with the skeptical challenge. To the person who\nasks, \u201cwhy be moral?,\u201d Smith essentially provides what\nChristine Korsgaard calls a \u201creflective endorsement\u201d\nargument (Korsgaard 1996: 19, 49\u201389). Reflective endorsement\ntheorists\u2014Korsgaard gives Hume and Butler as\nexamples\u2014substitute the question, \u201care the claims of our\nmoral nature good for human life?\u201d for the question, \u201care\nmoral claims true?\u201d They identify a certain faculty for approval\nor disapproval as giving force to moral claims, and then ask whether,\non reflection, we can approve of that faculty of approval itself. This\ntest requires in the first instance that the faculty of moral approval\napprove of its own workings. It then looks to whether our other\nfaculties of approval can approve of the moral one: we seek a\ncomprehensive endorsement, by all our modes of approval, of moral\napproval in particular. The second part of the test asks above all\nwhether the faculty for prudential approval\u2014the faculty by which\nwe applaud or condemn things in accordance with\nself-interest\u2014can applaud the moral faculty, since the latter\noften requires us to override our self-interest.\n\nWe should not assume that the first part of the test is trivial.\nKorsgaard quotes Hume\u2019s declaration that our sense for\nmorals\n\n\nmust certainly acquire new force, when reflecting on itself, it\napproves of those principles, from whence it is deriv\u2019d, and\nfinds nothing but what is great and good in its rise and origin, (Hume\n1739\u201340, pp. 267\u20138) \n\n\nand contrasts this with Hume\u2019s earlier demonstration that the\nunderstanding, when reflecting on its own procedures, undermines\nitself (Korsgaard 1996, p. 62). So a faculty can fail a purely\nreflexive test: it can fail to live up to its own standards for\nevaluation. But the moral sense, for Hume, and the impartial\nspectator, for Smith, pass their own tests. Indeed, a good way to read\nTMS is to see Smith as demonstrating, to an impartial spectator in a\nmoment of reflection, that the impartial spectator we use in the\ncourse of action operates in a reasonable and noble way\u2014that, in\nparticular, it is not just a tool of our self-interest.\n\nAt the same time, to meet the full reflective endorsement test, Smith\nneeds to show that heeding the impartial spectator does not, overall,\nconflict with our self-interest. In order to show this he\ntries, like many ancient ethicists, to get us to re-think the nature\nof self-interest. If we consider our real interests, Smith maintains,\nwe will see that the very question, \u201cwhy should I be\nmoral?,\u201d with its implicit supposition that being moral is\nsomething I might want to avoid, is based on a misconception of\nself-interest. \u201cThe chief part of human happiness arises from\nthe consciousness of being beloved\u201d (TMS 41), Smith says, and\nbeing beloved normally requires acting in accordance with the demands\nof the impartial spectator. Violating those demands will also normally\nbring on internal unease\u2014fear of discovery, pangs of conscience,\nand other disturbances\u2014making it difficult to achieve the\ntranquility that Smith takes to be a prime component of happiness (TMS\n149). Finally, if one fully incorporates the impartial spectator into\noneself, one will discover that moral self-approbation is itself a\ngreat source of happiness. But if happiness consists so centrally in\nthe approbation of others, and in self-approbation, there can be no\nreasonable conflict between pursuing happiness and pursuing morality.\nSo the demands of our moral sentiments are justified, capable both of\nendorsing themselves and of being endorsed by our nonmoral\nsentiments.\n\nIt should be clear that this argument does not involve any reduction\nof morality to self-interest. For Smith, the agent who supposes that\nself-interest can be defined independently of morality, and morality\nthen reduced to it, misunderstands the nature of self-interest. Such\nan agent lacks a well-developed impartial spectator within herself,\nand therefore fails to realize that acting in accordance with moral\ndemands is essential to her own happiness. She will gain a better\nunderstanding of happiness only once she starts to engage in the\npursuit of virtue. Smith explicitly says that the virtuous agent sees\nthings that others do not (TMS 115\u20137, 146\u20138). Like the\ncontemporary philosopher John McDowell, he thus suggests that the\nvirtuous agent can properly see the point of virtue, and how virtue\nhelps constitute happiness, only from a perspective within the actual\npractice of virtue. But, as McDowell says, there is no reason to think\none can find better arguments, or indeed any arguments, for seeking\nvirtue from a perspective outside of such practice (McDowell 1998a,b).\nThere may therefore be a certain circularity to Smith\u2019s defense\nof morality, as some of his critics have alleged, but the circularity\nis not a vicious one, and an entirely nonmoral defense of morality,\nwhich the critics seem to want, may be impossible.\n\nSmith himself does not clearly spell out the responses proposed here\nto the philosophical problems that his theory raises. His strengths as\na moral philosopher lie elsewhere. Moral philosophers need not be\nconcerned solely with the grounds of morality. Displaying, clarifying,\nand showing the internal connections in the way we think about virtue\nis already a philosophical task, even if we set aside the question of\nwhether that way of thinking is justified. There are indeed\nphilosophers who reject the idea that philosophy is well-suited to\noffer justifications. Smith\u2019s work fits in with the view of Iris\nMurdoch, who understood moral philosophy as consisting in the attempt\n\u201cto fill in a systematic explanatory background to our ordinary\nmoral life\u201d (Murdoch 1970, p. 45). His astute and nuanced\nanalysis of what goes into moral approval\u2014of the sorts of\nfactors the impartial spectator considers, of how it can deceive\nitself or otherwise go wrong, of how it develops and how it judges\ndifferent virtues in different ways\u2014is accomplishment enough,\nregardless of whether he adequately justifies the fact that we engage\nin such approval at all. \n\n",
