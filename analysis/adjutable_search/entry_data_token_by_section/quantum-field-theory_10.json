    "main_text": "Axiomatic Reformulations of QFT and their Interpretive Significance || Motive Two: Mathematical Rigour\n4.2 Motive Two: Mathematical Rigour\n\nSo far, we focussed on the operationalist motives for reformulating\nQFT and some of its consequences. Now we will distinguish different,\npartly competing ways of implementing these general ideas. The second\nmotive\u2014mathematical rigour\u2014consists foremost in the quest\ntowards a concise axiomatic formulation, instead\nof the grab bag of conventional QFT, with its numerous mathematically\ndubious, even though successful, approximation techniques. This quest\ncomprises three parts, namely, first, the choice of those entities\nupon which the axioms are to be imposed, second, the choice of\nappropriate axioms, and, third, the proof that one has actually\nachieved an axiomatic reformulation of\nconventional QFT, which can reproduce all the established empirical\nand theoretical successes. While axiomatic approaches are clear and\nsharp on the first two counts, their success is more limited with\nrespect to the third. In general, one can say there are valuable\nsuccesses with respect to very general theoretical insights, such as\nthe connection of spin and statistics as well as non-localizability,\nwhile the weak point is the lack of realistic models for interacting\nquantum field theories. Since the fundamental entities in axiomatic\nreformulations of QFT are algebras (of smeared\nfield operators or of observables) instead of quantum\nfields, reformulating QFT in algebraic terms and\nin axiomatic terms are enterprises with a large factual overlap.\nHowever, only one attempt to reformulate QFT axiomatically bears the\nname \u201cAlgebraic Quantum Field\nTheory,\u201d because it is here that the algebraic structure of the\nfundamental entities was first fully realized and is explicity at the\ncentre. However, trying to do this in a strictly axiomatic way, one\nonly gets \u2018reformulations\u2019 which are not as rich as\nstandard QFT. As Haag (1996) concedes, the \u201calgebraic approach\n[\u2026] has given us a frame and a language not a theory.\u201d\n\nWightman\u2019s \u201cfield axiomatics\u201d,\nalready mentioned above, is\u2013besides AQFT\u2013one of the two\nmost prominent proposals, for an axiomatisation of QFT. Both\noriginated in the 1950s and influenced each other in their\nformation. In Wightman\u2019s field axiomatics, the entities upon\nwhich the axioms are imposed are smeared field operators, in fact\npolynomial algebras \\(P(\\mathcal{O})\\) thereof. The crucial axioms are\ncovariance, microcausality\n(spacelike separated field operators required to either commute or\nanticommute), and spectrum condition (positive\nenergy in all Lorentz frames, so that the vacuum is a stable ground\nstate). One shortcoming of this approach is that field operators are\ngauge-dependent and thereby arguably not qualified as directly\nrepresenting physical quantities. Moreover, the use of unbounded\nfield operators makes Wightman\u2019s approach mathematically\ncumbersome.\n\nIn contrast, Algebraic Quantum Field Theory\n(AQFT)\u2014the most successful attempt to\nreformulate QFT axiomatically\u2014employs only bounded operators. It\nbuilds upon work in the 1940s by Gelfand, Neumark, and in particular\nSegal, who tried to describe quantum physics in terms of \\(C\\)*-algebras\n[section 4.1. in the entry Quantum Theory and Mathematical\nRigour has a more detailed account]. The notion of a \\(C\\)*-algebra\ngeneralizes the notion of\nthe algebra \\(\\mathcal{B(H)}\\) of all\nbounded operators on a Hilbert space \\(\\mathcal{H}\\),\nwhich is also the most important\nexample for a \\(C\\)*-algebra. In\nfact, it can be shown that any \\(C\\)*-algebra\nis isomorphic to a (norm-closed,\nself-adjoint) algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space. The\nboundedness (and self-adjointness) of the operators is the reason why\n\\(C\\)*-algebras are considered as\nideal for representing physical observables. The \u2018C\u2019\nindicates that one is dealing with a complex vector space and the\n\u2018*\u2019 refers to the operation that maps an element \\(A\\)\nof an algebra to its\ninvolution (or adjoint) \\(A\\)*,\nwhich generalizes the conjugate complex of\ncomplex numbers to operators. This involution is needed in order to\ndefine the crucial norm property of \\(C\\)*-algebras,\nwhich is of central importance for the\nproof of the above isomorphism claim.\n\nAQFT takes so-called nets of algebras as basic for the\nmathematical description of quantum systems, i.e., the mapping \\(\\mathcal{O}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{O})\\)\nfrom\nfinite space-time regions to algebras of local observables. The\ninsight behind this apporoach is that the net structure of algebras,\ni.e., the very way how algebras of local observables are linked to\nspace-time regions, supplies observables with physical significance.\nIn this rather abstract setting, physical states are identified as\npositive, linear, normalized functionals which map elements of local\nalgebras to real numbers. States can thus be understood as assignments\nof expectation values to observables. Via the so-called\nGelfand-Neumark-Segal construction, one can recover the concrete\nHilbert space representations in the conventional formalism. Thus,\n\u201call the Hilbert spaces we will ever need are hidden inside the\nalgebra itself\u201d (Halvorson & M\u00fcger 2007, section\n7).\n\nAQFT then imposes a whole list of axioms on the abstract algebraic\nstructure, namely relativistic axioms (in particular locality and\ncovariance), general physical assumptions (e.g., the spectrum\ncondition), and finally some technical assumptions concerning the\nmathematical formulation. The principle of (Einstein)\ncausality is the main relativistic ingredient of AQFT: All\nobservables of a local algebra connected with a space-time region\n\\(\\mathcal{O}\\) are required to\ncommute with all observables of another algebra which is associated\nwith a space-time region \\(\\mathcal{O}'\\)\nthat is space-like separated from\n\\(\\mathcal{O}\\). As a\nreformulation of QFT, AQFT is expected to\nreproduce the main features of QFT, like the existence of\nantiparticles, internal quantum numbers, the relation of spin and\nstatistics, etc. That this aim could not be achieved on a purely\naxiomatic basis is partly due to the fact that the connection between\nthe respective key concepts of AQFT and QFT, i.e., algebras of\nobservables and quantum fields, is not sufficiently clear. One main\nlink are superselection rules, which put restrictions on the\nset of all observables and allow for classification schemes in terms\nof permanent or essential properties.\n\nToday, many philosophers of physics who work on QFT rest most of their\nconsiderations on AQFT. This predominance of AQFT for foundational\nstudies about QFT becomes problematic, however, when AQFT is seen as a\nphysical theory in competition to Conventional QFT (CQFT). Wallace\n(2006, 2011) even urges that, seen from today, CQFT succeeded, whereas\nAQFT failed, so that \u201cto be lured away from the Standard Model\nby [AQFT] is sheer madness\u201d (Wallace 2011:124). Contra Wallace,\nFraser (2011) questions Wallace\u2019s crucial point in defense of\nCQFT, namely that the application of renormalization group techniques\nin QFT finally solved the problem of ultraviolet divergences that\ntroubled CQFT in the 1950s. The empirical success of renormalization\nin CQFT leaves the physical reasons for this success in the dark,\nargues Fraser, unlike in condensed matter physics, where its success\nis due to the fact that matter is discrete at atomic length\nscales.\n\nUltimately, the most reasonable position may be a liberal one,\naccording to which neither of the three, AQFT, Wightman\u2019s field\naxiomatics and CQFT, should be regarded as rival research programs,\nonly one of which can and should survive (Kuhlmann 2010b, Swanson\n2017). Wightman\u2019s Axiomatic QFT is fruitful in the construction\nof concrete models, AQFT is advantageous for ontological\nconsiderations because it clearly separates fundamental and derived\nentities, and CQFT is very good for actual calculations of the high\nenergy physicist.\n\nThe monographs Haag (1996) and Horuzhy (1990) and the articles Haag\n& Kastler (1964), Roberts (1990), Buchholz (1998) are\nintroductions to AQFT. Halvorson & M\u00fcger (2007), Ruetsche\n(2011) and Ruetsche (2012a,b) are tailored for philosophers of\nphysics, where the first emphasizes technical and the latter\ninterpretive issues. Streater & Wightman (1964) is an early\npioneering monograph on axiomatic QFT. Bratteli & Robinson (1997)\nis a classic on the mathematical theory of operator algebras,\nemphasising physical applications.  Philosophical studies on AQFT can\nbe found, among many others, in Baker (2009), Baker & Halvorson\n(2010), Earman & Fraser (2006), Fraser (2008, 2009, 2011),\nFeintzeig (2018), Feintzeig et al.  (2019), Feintzeig and Weatherall\n(2019), Kronz & Lupher (2005), Kuhlmann (2010a, 2010b), Lupher\n(2018), Miller (2018), R\u00e9dei & Valente (2010), and Ruetsche\n(2002, 2003, 2006, 2011).\n",
