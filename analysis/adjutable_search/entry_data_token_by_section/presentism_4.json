    "main_text": "Definitional Concerns || The Collapse of P3\n3.2 The Collapse of P3\n\nAssuming that the likes of Meyer are correct (and that the likes of\nCrisp are not), what should we make of premise (4)? What should we\nmake of the claim that: \u201conly present entities exist\nsimpliciter\u201d (P3) is false\nbecause P3 collapses into\nP2 (and P2 is\nfalse)? Perhaps we can argue that P3\ndoesn\u2019t collapse into P2, and that\nP3 represents a distinct way to state the\npresentist\u2019s ontic thesis. A defender of\nP3 might argue that there\u2019s a notion\nof \u201cexistence simpliciter\u201d that\u2019s\nintelligible, substantive and, importantly, distinct from the\n\u201ctensed\u201d (\u201ctemporal\u201d) notion of existence\nthat\u2019s captured in P2 (i.e.,\n\u201chas existed, exists now, or will exist\u201d).\n\nOnce again, there\u2019s clear and sustained disagreement about the\neffectiveness of this strategy. Suppose that we can insist sensibly\nthat there\u2019s a notion of \u201cexistence\nsimpliciter\u201d that helps presentism to avoid the\nchallenge that P3 collapses into\nP2. (If this is so, then our opponent\ncan\u2019t tell us, simply, that P3 is\nfalse if P2 is false.) Nevertheless, this\nraises the question as to what, precisely, is meant by\n\u201cx exists simpliciter\u201d and whether the\nnew notion can be used to characterize presentism.\n\nWhat does \u201cx exists simpliciter\u201d mean?\nIn this context, Meyer (2005: 214\u20135) tells us that if x\nexists simpliciter, then x exists either in the\nactual world, @, or else in some merely possible world. And, if\nx exists in @, then it exists in time, it exists\ntemporally; x either has existed, exists now, or\nwill exist. Thus, it seems that if we specify the meaning of\n\u201cx exists simpliciter\u201d, we must take it\nto mean either that x exists \u201coutside time\u201d, but\nsomehow still in @, or else at some other world. But, perhaps\ncontroversially, Meyer (2005: 215) argues that neither of these ways\nof specifying the notion of \u201cexistence\nsimpliciter\u201d will give us a characterization of\npresentism, qua model of time. Presentism is a view about\nwhat exists in time; it\u2019s not a thesis about what exists outside\nof time, nor is it a thesis about what exists at other possible\nworlds. (Recall, from the discussion of the implications of\nPA, above, that nothing exists outside time, for\npresentists; nothing exists that isn\u2019t present. Hence,\npresentism concerns what exists within time since it implies\nthat nothing exists without.)\n\nIt\u2019s only fair to conclude this part of the discussion by noting\nthat it\u2019s unclear how far we should be moved by these\nconsiderations. For instance, Daniel Deasy (2017) is clear that he\nthinks very little of this objection. Deasy discusses the objection\n(to presentism, defined as \u201calways, everything is\npresent\u201d), somewhat witheringly, as follows:\n\n\n[Some argue along the following lines:] the quantifier in the\ntraditional definition is either tensed or tenseless. If it is tensed\nthen presentism is the obviously false thesis that always, everything\nis now present. If it is tenseless then presentism is the trivially\ntrue thesis that always, everything is, was, or will be present.\n\u2026 The problem with this argument is that the key\npremise\u2014that the quantifier in the traditional definition is\neither tensed or tenseless\u2014is false. The universal quantifier in\nthe traditional definition (\u201ceverything\u201d) should be read\nas expressing exactly the universal quantifier of classical\nfirst-order predicate logic \u2026 [The] traditional definition is\nintended to express a metaphysical thesis, and metaphysical theses\nought to be expressed in the most metaphysically\nperspicuous\u2014i.e., most \u201cjoint carving\u201d\u2014terms\npossible. Classical first-order predicate logic is a much better\ncandidate for a language whose terms so cut than a natural language\nlike English. Moreover, the standard quantifiers of classical\nfirst-order predicate logic are neither \u201ctensed\u201d nor\n\u201ctenseless\u201d (or at least, not in the sense of the above\nargument). \u2026 [Quantifiers] are not verbs, they are quantifiers\n\u2026 Therefore there is no good reason to think the quantifiers\nhave either reading. (2017: 380\u20131)\n\n\nHowever, presentists shouldn\u2019t celebrate too early. They should\nremain cautious. Deasy goes on to raise an independent concern with\nhow to define presentism. Echoing a challenge from Timothy Williamson\n(2013: 24\u201325), Deasy objects that there\u2019s no satisfactory\nway to spell out what\u2019s meant by \u201cis present\u201d in the\ndefinition of presentism. Further, we may also need to say something\nabout the duration of the present (see Gentry 2021).\n",
