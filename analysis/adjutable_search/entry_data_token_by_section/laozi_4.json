    "main_text": "Approaches to the Laozi\n5. Approaches to the Laozi\n\n\nIs the Laozi a manual of self-cultivation and government? Is\nit a metaphysical treatise, or does it harbor deep mystical\ninsights?\n\n\nChapter 1 of the current Laozi begins with the famous words:\n\u201cThe Way that can be spoken of is not the constant Way.\u201d\nChapter 10 speaks of nourishing one\u2019s \u201csoul\u201d and embracing\nthe \u201cOne.\u201d Chapter 80 depicts the ideal polity as a small\ncountry with few inhabitants.\n\n\nThe Laozi is a difficult text. Its language is often cryptic;\nthe sense or reference of the many symbols it employs remains unclear,\nand there seems to be conceptual inconsistencies. For example, whereas\nchapter 2 refers to the \u201cmutual production of being and\nnonbeing,\u201d chapter 40 declares, \u201cBeing originates in\nnonbeing\u201d (Henricks, trans. 1989). Is it more meaningful to\nspeak of the \u201cworldviews\u201d of the Daodejing,\ninstead of a unified vision?\n\n\nIf the Laozi were an \u201canthology\u201d put together at\nrandom by different compilers over a long period of time, occasional\ninconsistencies need not be an issue. Traditionally, however, this was\nnever a serious option. Most modern studies are equally concerned to\ndisclose the \u201cdeeper\u201d unity and meaning of the\nclassic. While some seek to recover the \u201coriginal\u201d meaning\nof the Laozi, others celebrate its contemporary\nrelevance. Consider, first of all, some of the main modern approaches\nto the Daodejing (cf. Hardy 1998).\n\n\nOne view is that the Laozi reflects a deep mythological\nconsciousness at its core. The myth of \u201cchaos,\u201d in\nparticular, helps shape the Daoist understanding of the cosmos and the\nplace of human beings in it (Girardot 1983). Chapter 25, for example,\nlikens the Dao to an undifferentiated oneness. The myth of a great\nmother earth goddess may also have informed the worldview of the\nLaozi (Erkes 1935; Chen 1969), which explains its emphasis on\nnature and the feminine (Chen 1989). Chapter 6, for example, refers to\nthe \u201cspirit of the valley,\u201d which is also called the\n\u201cmysterious female.\u201d\n\n\nA second view is that the Laozi gives voice to a profound\nmysticism. According to Victor Mair (1990), it is indebted to Indian\nmysticism (see also Waley 1958). According to Benjamin Schwartz\n(1985), the mysticism of the Daodejing is sui\ngeneris, uniquely Chinese and has nothing to do with\nIndia. Indeed, as one scholar suggests, it is unlike other mystical\nwritings in that ecstatic vision does not play a role in the ascent of\nthe Daoist sage (Welch 1965, 60). According to another interpretation,\nhowever, there is every indication that ecstasy forms a part of the\nworld of the Laozi, although it is difficult to gauge the\n\u201cdegree\u201d of its mystical leanings (Kaltenmark 1969, 65). A\nmore recent champion of the mystical view is Harold Roth, who argues\nthat Daoist \u201cinner cultivation\u201d and Indian yoga may be\nsimilar, but \u201cthey are parallel developments in different\ncultures at different times.\u201d (Roth 1999, 137).\n\n\nIt is possible to combine the mystical and mythological\napproaches. Although the presence of ancient religious beliefs can\nstill be detected, they have been raised to a \u201chigher\u201d\nmystical plane in the Laozi (e.g., Ching 1997). Broadly, one\ncould carve out a third category of interpretations that highlights\nthe religious significance of the Laozi, whether in general\nterms or aligned with the tenets of religious Daoism.\n\n\nA fourth view sees the Laozi mainly as a work of philosophy,\nwhich gives a metaphysical account of reality and insight into Daoist\nself-cultivation and government; but fundamentally it is not a work of\nmysticism (W. T. Chan 1963). The strong practical interest of\nthe Laozi distinguishes it from any mystical doctrine that\neschews worldly involvement. In H. G. Creel\u2019s (1977) words, it is\n\u201cpurposive\u201d and not purely\n\u201ccontemplative.\u201d\n\n\nFifth, to many readers the Laozi offers essentially a\nphilosophy of life. Remnants of an older religious thinking may have\nfound their way into the text, but they have been transformed into a\nnaturalistic philosophy. The emphasis on naturalness translates into a\nway of life characterized by simplicity, calmness, and freedom from\nthe tyranny of desire (e.g., Liu Xiaogan 1997). For Roger Ames and\nDavid Hall (2003), indeed, the essence of the Laozi is\n\u201cmaking this life significant.\u201d Unlike the claim that\nthe Laozi espouses a mystical or esoteric teaching directed\nat a restricted audience, this view tends to highlight its universal\nappeal and contemporary relevance.\n\n\nSixth, the Laozi is above all concerned with realizing peace\nand sociopolitical order. It is an ethical and political masterpiece\nintended for the ruling class, with concrete strategic suggestions\naimed at remedying the moral and political turmoil engulfing late Zhou\nChina. Self-cultivation is important, but the ultimate goal extends\nbeyond personal fulfillment (Lau 1963, LaFargue 1992, Moeller\n2006). The Laozi criticizes the Confucian school not only for\nbeing ineffectual in restoring order but more damagingly as a culprit\nin worsening the ills of society at that time. The ideal seems to be a\nkind of \u201cprimitive\u201d society, in the non-pejorative sense\nwhere people would dwell in simplicity, harmony and contentment, not\nfettered by ambition or desire (e.g., Needham 1956).\n\n\nThis list is far from exhaustive; there are other views of\nthe Laozi. Chad Hansen (1992), for example, focuses on the\n\u201canti-language\u201d philosophy of the text. Different\ncombinations are also possible. A. C. Graham, for example, emphasizes\nboth the mystical and political elements, arguing that the\nLaozi was probably targeted at the ruler of a small state\n(1989, 234). For Hans-Georg Moeller (2006), though a work of political\nphilosophy in its original context, the Laozi offers a\npowerful critique of \u201chumanism\u201d that is ethically as\nrelevant then as it is now. The Laozi could be seen as\nencompassing all of the above\u2014such categories as the\nmetaphysical, ethical, political, mystical, and religious form a\nunified whole in Daoist thinking and are deemed separate and distinct\nonly in modern Western thought. Alternatively, coming back to the\nquestion of multiple authorship and coherence, it could be argued that\nthe Laozi contains \u201clayers\u201d of material put\ntogether by different people at different times (Emerson 1995).\n\n\nIs it fair to say that the Laozi is inherently\n\u201cpolysemic\u201d (Robinet 1998), open to diverse\ninterpretations? This concerns not only the difficulty of\nthe Laozi but also the interplay between reader and text in\nany act of interpretation.\n\n\nPolysemy challenges the assertion that the \u201cintended\u201d\nmeaning of the Laozi can be recovered fully. But, it is\nimportant to emphasize, it does not follow that context is\nunimportant, that parameters do not exist, or that there are no checks\nagainst particular interpretations. While hermeneutic reconstruction\nremains an open process, it cannot disregard the rules of\nevidence. Questions of provenance, textual variants, as well as the\nentire tradition of commentaries and modern scholarship are important\nfor this reason. And it is for this same reason that the present\narticle leaves the discussion of the Laozi itself till the\nend. The following presents some of the main concepts and symbols in\nthe Laozi based on the current text, focusing on the key\nconceptual cluster of Dao, de (virtue), ziran\n(naturalness), and wuwei (nonaction). I propose that the two\nreadings represented by the Heshanggong and Wang Bi commentaries both\nbring out important insight from the Laozi.\n",
