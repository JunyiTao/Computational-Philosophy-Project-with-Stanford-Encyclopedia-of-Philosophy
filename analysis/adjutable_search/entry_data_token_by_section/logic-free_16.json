Some Applications\n\nThis section considers applications of free logic in theories of\ndefinite descriptions, languages that allow partial or non-strict\nfunctions, logics with Kripke semantics, logics of fiction and logics\nthat are in a certain sense \u201cMeinongian.\u201d Free logic has\nalso found application elsewhere\u2014most prominently in theories of\npredication, programming languages, set theory, logics of\npresupposition (with neutral semantics), and definedness logics. For\nmore on these and other applications, see Lambert 1991 and 2001b;\nLehman 2002, pp. 250\u2013253; and Nolt 2006, pp.\n1039\u20131053.\n",
