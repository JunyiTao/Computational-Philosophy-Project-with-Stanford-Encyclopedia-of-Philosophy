    "main_text": "Social Theory\n5. Social Theory\n\nAlthough our main witness for Epicurus\u2019 views on the evolution\nof human society is Lucretius\u2019 poem (5.925\u20131457), there is\nno doubt that Lucretius was following, in the main, the ideas of the\nfounder himself, as recorded in Epicurus\u2019 On Nature and\nother treatises. In the beginning, human beings were solitary; they\nreproduced haphazardly, could not communicate verbally, had no social\ninstitutions, and survived because they were physically hardier than\ntheir modern descendants. With time, the race softened, thanks in part\nto the discovery of fire, in part too to the emergence of the family\nand the gentler sentiments toward spouses and offspring to which the\nfamily gave rise. At this stage, human beings were in a position to\nunite in order to fend off natural dangers, such as wild beasts, and\nthey developed various kinds of technical skills, such as agriculture\nand the building of houses, as well as language. Epicurus explains\n(LH 75\u201376) that names at first arose naturally, in the\nsense that as human beings experienced different affects\n(path\u00ea) or received various images\n(phantasmata) they emitted air corresponding to these\nstimuli; since human physical characteristics vary somewhat from place\nto place, however, the sounds people produced in response to any given\nstimulus similarly differed, which explains why there are many\ntongues. Upon this basis, people later, nation by nation, established\ncertain terms by convention for the purpose of improving clarity and\nbrevity in communication. Finally, certain individual experts further\naugmented the vocabulary by the introduction of new and specialized\nwords, to explain the results of their theoretical investigations.\nOnce language reached a developed state, people began to establish\nalliances and friendships, which contributed further to collective\nsecurity.\n\nThis early form of social life had various advantages: among others,\nthe relative scarcity of goods prevented excessive competition\n(sharing was obligatory for survival) and thereby set limits on those\nunnatural desires that at a later, richer phase of society would lead\nto wars and other disturbances. It would appear too that, before\nlanguage had developed fully, words more or less conformed to their\noriginal or primitive objects, and were not yet a source of mental\nconfusion. But thanks to a gradual accumulation of wealth, the\nstruggle over goods came to infect social relations, and there emerged\nkings or tyrants who ruled over others not by virtue of their physical\nstrength but by dint of gold. These autocrats in turn were overthrown,\nand after a subsequent period of violent anarchy people finally saw\nthe wisdom of living under the rule of law. This might seem to\nrepresent the highest attainment in political organization, but that\nis not so for the Epicureans. For with law came the generalized fear\nof punishment that has contaminated the blessings of life (Lucretius\n5.1151; cf. [Philodemus] On Choices and Avoidances col. XII).\nLucretius at this point gives an acount of the origin of religious\nsuperstition and dread of the gods, and although he does not relate\nthis anxiety directly to the fear of punishment under human law, he\ndoes state that thunder and lightning are interpreted as signs that\nthe gods are angry at human sins (5.1218\u201325). While primitive\npeople in the presocial or early communal stages might have been awed\nby such manifestations of natural power and ascribed them to the\naction of the gods, they would not necessarily have explained them as\nchastisement for human crimes before the concept of punishment became\nfamiliar under the regime of law. People at an early time knew that\ngods exist thanks to the simulacra that they give off, although the\nprecise nature of the gods according to Epicurus remains obscure (for\ncontrasting intepretations, see Konstan 2011 and Sedley 2011); but the\ngods, for him, do not interest themselves in human affairs, since this\nwould compromise their beatitude (see Obbink 1996: 321\u201323).\n\nIf one does not fear the gods, what motive is there for living justly?\nWhere law obtains, Epicurus indicates, it is preferable not to commit\ncrimes, even secret ones, since there will always be anxiety over the\npossibility of detection, and this will disrupt the tranquillity or\nataraxy that is the chief basis of happiness in life (see\nPrincipal Beliefs = KD 34\u201335). Justice, for\nEpicurus, depends on the capacity to make compacts neither to harm\nothers nor be harmed by them, and consists precisely in these\ncompacts; justice is nothing in itself, independent of such\narrangements (KD 31\u201333). According to Epicurus\n(LM 132, KD 5), someone who is incapable of living\nprudently, honorably, and justly cannot live pleasurably, and vice\nversa. Moreover, prudence or wisdom (phron\u00easis) is the\nchief of the virtues: on it depend all the rest. This again sounds\ncalculating, as though justice were purely a pragmatic and selfish\nmatter of remaining unperturbed. Epicurus does not entertain the\nthought experiment proposed by Plato in the Republic\n(359C\u2013360D), in which Plato asks whether a person who is\nabsolutely secure from punishment would have reason to be just. Did\nEpicurus have an answer to such a challenge? He may simply have denied\nthat anyone can be perfectly confident in this way. Perhaps, however,\nhe did have a reply, but it was derived from the domain of psychology\nrather than of ethics. A person who understands what is desirable and\nwhat is to be feared would not be motivated to acquire inordinate\nwealth or power, but would lead a peaceful life to the extent\npossible, avoiding politics and the general fray. An Epicurean sage,\naccordingly, would have no motive to violate the rights of others.\nWhether the sage would be virtuous is perhaps moot; what Epicurus says\nis that he would live virtuously, that is prudently, honorably, and\njustly (the adverbial construction may be significant). He would do so\nnot because of an acquired disposition or hexis, as Aristotle\nhad it, but because he knows how to reason correctly about his needs.\nHence his desires would be limited to those that are natural (not\nempty), and so easily satisfied, or at least not a source of\ndisturbance if sometimes unsatisfied.\n",
