    "main_text": "Heidegger for Art, Introduction:  The Three Pillars of Heidegger\u2019s Understanding of Art || The Phenomenological Difficulty Heidegger Introduces Van Gogh to Address\n3.3 The Phenomenological Difficulty Heidegger Introduces Van Gogh to Address\n\n\nThe basic problem, we have seen, is that the way works of art\nfunction in the background of our everyday experience cannot be\nadequately described in aesthetic terms (as a subject\u2019s\nexperience of an art object) because: (1) aesthetics presupposes\nthe subject/object dichotomy; (2) this subject/object dichotomy emerges\nonly at a secondary level of experience, when our primary, integral\nengagement with the world of practical equipment breaks down; and (3)\nsecondary structures of experience like the subject/object dichotomy\ncannot recapture the primordial level of our engagement with the world\n(the level from which it originally derives), because any such\ndescription of an external object \u201con hand\u201d for a subject misses\nprecisely what it is like to encounter \u201cequipment\u201d\nin a hands-on way. Objective descriptions of equipment bypass the\nvery \u201cequipmentality of equipment [Zeughaften des\nZeuges]\u201d (PLT 32/GA5 17)\u2014as Heidegger still phrases\nthe point in \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d\u2014because\nsuch descriptions fail to notice, let alone capture, what it is like to\nbe integrally involved with equipment in engaged use. The\nfundamental problem, then, is: How can such engaged use ever be\nadequately described and communicated?\n\n\nIt is this difficult attempt to describe phenomenologically\n\u201cwhat equipment in truth is\u201d (PLT 32/GA5 17)\u2014that is,\nto convey the way we encounter something when we are not aware of it as\nan object at all but, instead, are completely immersed in our practical\nengagement with it\u2014that motivates Heidegger not just to mention\nbut genuinely to introduce Van Gogh\u2019s painting, which Heidegger\nthus presents simply \u201cas an example of a common sort of\nequipment\u2014a pair of farmer\u2019s shoes\u201d (PLT 32/GA5\n18). In Van Gogh\u2019s most famous painting of\n \u201cA Pair of Shoes\u201d\n(1886), Heidegger believes we can\n\u201cdiscover what the equipmental being of equipment is in\ntruth\u201d (PLT 33/GA5 18). In other words, Heidegger thinks\nVan Gogh\u2019s painting reveals what it is like genuinely to\nencounter a shoe in its use as a shoe. As he puts it:\n\n\nThe farming woman wears her shoes in the field. Only here are\nthey what they are. They are all the more genuinely so, the less\nthe farming woman at work thinks about the shoes, or senses them at\nall, or is even aware of them. (PLT 33/GA5 18)\n\n\nHeidegger thus introduces Van Gogh\u2019s painting of (what he\ntakes to be) a farmer\u2019s shoes in order \u201cto facilitate the\nvisual realization\u201d of \u201cequipmentality,\u201d that\nprimordial modality of existence in which we are integrally involved\nwith our world and so encountering equipment in a non-thematic,\nhands-on\n way.[52]\n\n\nYet, this is a deeply paradoxical move, as Heidegger himself\nrealizes, because Van Gogh\u2019s painting does not picture shoes\nbeing used as equipment; it pictures shoes merely standing there like\nobjects in a still-life painting! We will thus remain caught in\nan aesthetic experience, Heidegger acknowledges, \u201cas long as we\nsimply look at the empty, unused shoes as they stand there in the\npicture\u201d (PLT 33/GA5 19). The deep puzzle here, then,\nis: How is Van Gogh\u2019s picture of \u201cempty, unused\nshoes\u201d standing there like objects supposed to help us uproot and\ntranscend the subject/object dichotomy lying at the heart of modern\naesthetics? How, to put the puzzle in Heidegger\u2019s terms, is\na picture supposed to help us find a way out of the age of the world\npicture? How is our experience of a painting of a pair of shoes\nstanding there like objects supposed to lead us back to a pre-objective\nencounter with \u201cequipmentality\u201d? How, in other words,\ncan aesthetics transcend itself from within?\n\n\nHere Heidegger has set up a genuine aporia\u2014or better, an\nHolzweg, a \u201cforest path\u201d or, more colloquially,\n\u201ca path to nowhere.\u201d It is not a coincidence that\nHolzwege is the title Heidegger gave to the book of essays\nthat opens with \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art.\u201d As\nHeidegger hints (in the otherwise empty page he had inserted into the\nbook, before its first page), an Holzweg is a path through the\nwoods made by foresters (and known to backwoods hikers as well as\nlocals who follow these paths to gather their own firewood, as\nHeidegger himself did). Such a path eventually comes to an\napparent dead-end, but this dead-end\u2014seen differently\u2014turns\nout to be a \u201cclearing\u201d (or Lichtung), that is, a\nplace from which the trees have been removed which thus offers an\nunexpected vista, an epiphany that, although it results only from\nwalking a particular path for oneself, nevertheless seems to come from\nout of the middle of nowhere. For Heidegger, moreover, the\nencounter with a \u201cclearing\u201d in a forest from which all the\ntrees have been removed\u2014that is, an encounter with\nnothing, initially\u2014makes it possible for us to notice\nthe light through which we ordinarily see the forest. In his\nterms, a clearing redirects our attention from entities to being, that\nusually unnoticed ontological light through which things\nordinarily appear. Seeing differently, Heidegger thus suggests,\ncan turn an apparent dead-end into the occasion for an ontological\nepiphany.\n",
