    "main_text": "Three-self Theories || Concept-relative Monotheism\n2.7 Concept-relative Monotheism\n\nEinar B\u00f8hn (2011) argues that trinitarian problems of\nself-consistency vanish when one realizes that the Trinity \u201cis\njust an ordinary case of one-many identity\u201d (363). He takes from\nFrege the idea that number-properties are concept-relative. Thus,\n\n\n\u2026conceptualizing the portion of reality that is God as the\nFather, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, we have conceptualized it as\nbeing three in number, but it is nonetheless the same portion of\nreality as what we might conceptualize as God, and hence as being one\nin number. (366)\n\nThere is no privileged way of conceptualizing [this portion of\nreality] in terms of which we can explain the other way. Both ways are\nequally legitimate. (369)\n\n\nA difficulty for this approach is that most philosophers don\u2019t\nthink there can be one-many identity relations. Some think\nidentity\u00a0is of necessity a one-one relation, although others\nallow there can be many-many identity; for instance, it may be that\nthe three men who committed the robbery are identical to the three men\nwho were convicted of the robbery. Those who believe identity can be\none-many typically do so because they accept the controversial thesis\nthat composition (the relation of parts to a whole they compose)\nshould be understood as identity. Although B\u00f8hn does accept\nthat thesis (B\u00f8hn 2014), he argues that this Trinity theory\nrelies only on our having \u201ca primitive notion of plural\nidentity\u201d (371), that is, a concept we understand without\nreference to any concept from mereological (parts and wholes) theory.\nFor example, we can recognize a certain human body to be identical to\na certain plurality of head, torso, two arms, and two legs. And we can\nrecognize that a pair of shoes is identical to a plurality of shoes\n(365).\n\nB\u00f8hn argues that orthodoxy, by the standards of either the New\nTestament or the \u201cAthanasian\u201d Creed (see section\n 5.3),\n requires that the Persons of the Trinity be distinct (i.e. no one is\nidentical to any other) but not that any is identical to the one God.\nRather, orthodoxy requires that the one God is identical to the Three\nconsidered as a plurality. Thus, e.g. \u201cThe Father is God\u201d\nmust be read predicatively, that is, not as identifying the Father\nwith God, but rather as describing the Father as divine (364, 367 n.\n13).\n\nDoes this theory make God\u2019s triunity dependent on human thought?\nAnd might the divine portion of reality equally well be conceived as\nseventeen? B\u00f8hn replies,\n\nThat numerical properties are relational properties with concepts as\ntheir relational units is compatible with reality having a real and\nobjective numerical structure. (372)\n\n\nThus, it doesn\u2019t follow that any conceptualization of this\nportion of reality is equally correct. While in this context he demurs\nfrom saying anything about concepts (372), it seems that B\u00f8hn\nassumes in Fregean fashion that concepts are objective and not\nmind-dependent (B\u00f8hn 2013, Section 1).\n\nJoseph Long (2019) objects that the theory is unorthodox because it\nrequires a type of thing which is divine and yet which is neither the\nTrinity nor any divine Person. Further, B\u00f8hn\u2019s talk of\n\u201cportions of reality\u201d is unintelligible. Finally,\northodoxy demands that the Persons of the Trinity \u201care one God\nregardless of our conceptual scheme\u201d, whereas on this\naccount whether or not the Persons are one god is relative to how we\nconceptualize them.\n\nSheiva Kleinschmidt argues that theories on which composition is\nexplained in terms of identity are of no use to the trinitarian, for\nsuch theories add no significant options to the options the\ntrinitarian already has (Kleinschmidt 2012).\n",
