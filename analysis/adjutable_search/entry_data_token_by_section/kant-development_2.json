Student Years: \u201cMarking Out the Path to Be Taken\u201d\nWhen Kant entered the University of K\u00f6nigsberg in 1740, he was\nsixteen. Financial considerations at home left much to be\ndesired. His widowed father filed his taxes as a pauper. But, a\nmaternal uncle, shoemaker Richter, supported Immanuel\u2019s studies. In\naddition, Immanuel supplemented his uncle\u2019s beneficence by working as\na tutor to fellow students. Often he did so for free, but, on\noccasion, Kant would accept luxuries to supplement his modest\nmeans. He was a sober and quiet student, not engaging in the\nfrivolous activities common to university\nstudents.[9] Yet\nKant was no drudge either. He enjoyed playing billiards, and did so\nwith such skill that he and his companions often won small sums of\nmoney to help defray the cost of living. As a member of the\nuniversity, Kant had risen to a new rank within society. In so doing,\nhe enjoyed privileges of this class and exemptions from duties e.g.,\nmilitary service/conscription, to which the lower classes were\nsusceptible. For a person of slight build and fragile constitution,\nKant\u2019s upward social status concomitant exemptions very likely saved\nhis life.\nPastor Schulz had hoped the university student Kant would pursue a\nchurch career, but instead he took courses in logic, ethics,\nmetaphysics, natural law, and mathematics. Martin Knutzen\n(1713\u20131751), Kant\u2019s advisor, introduced him to\nthe Principia (1687) and the Optics (1704), and\nprobably led him to think about natural philosophy. Additionally, Kant\nattended classes with Johann Gottfried Teske (1704\u20131772), whose\ncourses on electricity and experimental physics would inspire Kant\u2019s\ndoctoral dissertation De Igne or Meditations on Fire\n(1755).\nFour years into his university education, the Kant family suffered\nanother set-back. In 1744, Kant\u2019s father, Johann, suffered a\nstroke. Immanuel, twenty years old and now the head of the family,\nattended to his father\u2019s health and stopped attending classes the\nfollowing year. He started writing on natural philosophy around this\ntime, trying to determine the properties of force, a theme much in\ncurrency at the time. In 1746, he buried his father, wrote the bulk of\nhis first work, submitted it to the censor, and secured a publisher. A\nyear later, in 1747, he completed the Thoughts on the True\nEstimation of Living Forces, settled the family\u2019s affairs, found\nhomes for his younger brother and three sisters, and moved in with\nanother student. The Living Forces is his first known text,\nfirst publication, and first book.\nBut when Kant completed it, he withdrew from the university. In\n1748, he left town, without a degree, to work as a tutor for a noble\nfamily in the countryside.\nIt is tempting to explain Kant\u2019s academic failure with financial\nreasons\u2014his parents were deceased and the children had no\nsavings. Ostensibly Kant was responsible for not merely himself, but\nfor his siblings as well. Finances were tight, at the very best.\nHowever, the Kant family did have a benefactor, their uncle Richter,\nwho paid his course fees when Kant was enrolled and financed his\npublication after Kant had left (Borowski 1804: 46; Lasswitz 1902:\n521). Richter would keep supporting him and paid the printer for his\nsecond book (1755), too. Poverty was thus not likely the reason for\nhis withdrawing. Nor was it the lack of a thesis. The Living\nForces is a technical tract, 256 pages in the 1749-edition, more\nthan enough for a Magister-degree.\nYet Kant wrote the book in German, not in the Latin required for\nacademic theses, although high school had provided him with excellent\nphilological skills. Apparently he had not intended to submit\nthe Living Forces as his Master\u2019s thesis. Why?\nThe contents supply the key. He declares that he shall criticize\nLeibniz and Wolff (ii, 1:7). He rejects the doctrine of\npre-established harmony according to which substances do not interact,\nrejecting Leibniz\u2019s claim (Monadology 1714: sec. 7) that\nsubstances have no \u201cwindows\u201d. For Kant, they do. Following\nKnutzen (who had earned his doctorate with a similar critique in 1735)\nhe says that substances change each other\u2019s states by their mutual\nactions (#4, 1:19). He also rejects Wolff\u2019s notion of a \u201cmoving\nforce\u201d.  Kant argues (#3, 1:18) that force and motion have\nlittle to do with one another. Force is not so much about motion and\nmore about being. So a \u201cmoving force\u201d is a misnomer. For\nKant, living forces are better described as the dynamic source for\nnature, an \u201cactive force\u201d or a vis activa.\nThat Kant criticized Leibniz and Wolff should have improved his\nchances at graduation. Knutzen questioned their views, too. And\ncritically evaluating Leibniz and Wolff was the righteous thing to do,\neven in the moderate Pietist atmosphere of Kant\u2019s university. The\ntheologian Lange in Halle had orchestrated Wolff\u2019s expulsion from\nPrussia (1723) and triggered a furious row over Wolff\u2019s Leibnizian\nleanings (1723\u201340). Other Pietists followed suit and rejected\nWolff because his support of Leibnizian harmony. This, combined with\nhis view of the world as a network of uniform substances, smelled of\nheresy. Wolff was considered a dangerous radical. But Kant\u2019s reasons\nfor criticizing Wolff were different\u2014Wolff was not radical\nenough.\nKant lays out his view in the first ten sections. Everything begins\nwith force. It is even prior to extension, as Leibniz had already said\n(#1; 1:17). Here Leibniz is right, Kant thinks, and praises him for\nhaving shed light on the Aristotelian concept of the entelechy, and\nLeibniz\u2019s recovery of the basis for substantial forms. Yet Leibniz\ndoes not go far enough. Nature\u2019s units are active forces (#1\u20133;\n1:17\u201318). Their action is constructive; they make and sustain\nthe fabric of nature. The world is a tapestry of energy\nconcentrations. Forces rule everything, not only bodily motions (#2;\n1:18.6\u20138), but all activities (#3; 1:18.27\u201336). This\nincludes mind-body interaction\u2014materially produced ideas and\nmentally intended actions (#6; 1:20.35\u201321.1;\n21.14\u201316).\nDynamic action is absolutely fundamental. Force has effects by\nacting externally (ausser sich wirken; #4; 1:19.5), and, in\nthe full sense of the word, external action locates force\n(#6; 1:20.36\u20131:21.1). A force acts by radiating its action; it\nspreads its effects out (ihre Wirkungen von sich ausbreiten;\n#10; 1:24.23), and this spread determines its source as being inside\nit, locating force in virtue of its action. With action comes location\n(Ort), with location space (Raum), and with space\nthe universe (Welt)\u2014and none of this would be without\nforce. Localized forces weave the world (#8) such that their\ninteraction forms networks (#7), braiding relation, order, and space\n(#9, 1:23.5\u20139). Force is the primum, knitting space and\neverything within.\nAs one source acts on what is outside of it, multiple sources act\non one another. They do so when their fields meet. For example, throw\ntwo pebbles into a pond and watch the interfering ripples: first,\npoint sources encounter each other\u2019s activities at the boundary of\ntheir expanding radiations; next, these pulses, when striking each\nother, are modified when struck. External modifications of a radiation\naffect its internal makeup. Since force is an active pulse, and since\nactivity, for Kant, describes force better than anything else, a\ncollision with another field has constitutive effects on the original\nactivity.  (Consider weather\u2014when air masses collide, they\naffect each other\u2019s dew point, temperature, or pressure.) Hence Kant\nconcludes that the action of force-points amounts to mutual changes of\ntheir internal states (#4; 1:19.4\u20136).\nDynamic expansion and interaction through location makes space, and\nreciprocal action creates structure. Force-points stretch, grip, and\ntake hold, and the mutually modifying engagements constitute their\nconnections (#7; 1:21.30\u201333). This has consequences. That force,\nin virtue of its action, is put \u201csomewhere\u201d suggests a\nbond of force and space. This interactive bond is constitutive of\nreality.\nThese bold ideas doomed the text. A Christian advisor, even an\nopen-minded one, could never approve it. The dynamic ontology in\nchapter 1 contradicts the genesis account found in the\nBible. According to the Bible, God is the creator of everything. But\nKant suggests that force creates everything\u2014force, not God, is\nthe creator of nature. Worse, force can be modeled mathematically, as\nhe argues in chapter 2, and it can be jointly determined by two\nquantities, as he argues in chapter 3. \u201cGod\u201d is merely a\nplaceholder for the cause of force itself.\nNow Kant speaks of God as possible maker of multiple universes (#8;\n1:22), as engineer of dimensions (#11; 1:25), and as sealing off this\nworld from improbable others (ibid.). But in the same breath\n(#7\u201310), he makes force responsible for these tasks. And he\nalready showed his hand in his praise for the entelechy. Entelechies\nare programs of the self-organization and sustenance of\nthings\u2014in Aristotle\u2019s words, a dynamis put en\nergon or put in action; i.e., energeia.\nKant\u2019s waffling over God and force permits only two readings.\nNeither of them would be palatable to any Christian worth his salt:\neither God is creative force, or God created creative force. By Kant\u2019s\naccount, the former would mean that God is describable as a physical\nquantity. The latter would imply that force, not God, created the\nuniverse. Whoever suggests either is not a believer and does not\ndeserve to graduate under a Pietist advisor, not even a liberal\none.\nSo Kant was passed over. Knutzen never recommended him, and in\nKnutzen\u2019s letters to Leonard Euler (1707\u201383), he is not on the\nlist of excellent students (Waschkies 1987: 20). The professor had\nmore regular favorites, such as Johann Weitenkampf (b. 1726) and\nFriedrich Buck (1722\u201386), who succeeded to Knutzen\u2019s chair\n(Pozzo 1993: 283\u2013322; Kuehn 2001b: 23).\nKant took resort to irony (#4; 1:21.3\u20138) and avenged himself\nby not mentioning his teacher\u2014ever. Many years later (1770),\nafter Knutzen\u2019s death, when Kant finally enjoyed some public\nrecognition, he would secure his long-desired professorship by\nstriking a deal with the administration to snatch Knutzen\u2019s chair from\nBuck, pushing the pet student to another post without even asking.\nA word by Seneca sets the tune for Kant\u2019s\ndebut\u2014\u201cNothing is more important than to go where one\nought to go, instead of following the herd, like cattle, and go where\nthey went\u201d.[10]\n Kant expresses the hope that \u201cthe\nfreedom I take of contradicting great men won\u2019t be construed as a\ncrime\u201d (1:7.6\u20139). He needed hope because he had made up\nhis mind. He knew what he was doing, and he was defiant. \u201cMy\nbasis is as follows,\u201d he writes (1:10.25\u20137), \u201cI\nhave already marked out the path that I shall take. I shall set out\non my course, and nothing shall stop me from proceeding along\nit\u201d.\n",
