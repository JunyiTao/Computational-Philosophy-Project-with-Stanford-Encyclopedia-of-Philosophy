    "main_text": "The Atomism of Kal\u0101m || Al-Naz\u0323z\u0323\u0101m and Leaps\n1.4 Al-Naz\u0323z\u0323\u0101m and Leaps\n\nAgain as a general rule most of the speculative theologians adopted an\natomistic framework for explaining natural phenomena; however, such a\nposition was not without its critics even within the kalam\ntradition itself, and the most notorious of these critics was Ibrahim\nal-Naz\u0323z\u0323\u0101m (d. ca. 840). Al-Naz\u0323z\u0323\u0101m denied the atom-accident ontology of\nmost theologians and instead maintained that with the one exception of\nthe accident of motion everything else in our world was a body.\nMoreover, bodies, as well as space, did not have an atomic structure,\nbut a continuous one according to al-Naz\u0323z\u0323\u0101m. Affirming continuous\nspace and motion left al-Naz\u0323z\u0323\u0101m vulnerable to Zeno-style paradoxes,\nand indeed the atomist Abu Hudhayl openly confronted him with the\nant-sandal paradox sketched above. Al-Naz\u0323z\u0323\u0101m\u2019s solution was to\nmaintain that a moving object, such as an ant, could cross a\ncontinuous space with its infinite number of halfway points by means\nof a leap (t\u0323afra). The general idea was that a moving body\ncould cover a continuous space by making a finite number of leaps and\nthat during each leap the moving body is not in the intervening\nspaces. In other words, a moving body leaps from some first place to a\nthird place on a continuous magnitude without having passed through\nany second place between the two.\n\nDespite the counterintuitive nature of al-Naz\u0323z\u0323\u0101m\u2019s suggestion, he\nargued that even the atomists had to posit leaps as well. He had one\nimagine the rotation of a millstone. Now in a single rotation an atom\nat the outer edge of the wheel would traverse a distance equal to the\ncircumference of the wheel, whereas an atom at the hub would traverse\na shorter distance equal to the circumference of the hub. Since the\natom at the outer edge is traversing a greater distance in an equal\ntime as the atom at the hub, the atom at the outer edge must be moving\nfaster than the atom at the hub. Al-Naz\u0323z\u0323\u0101m next observed that there is\nonly one of two ways to explain this phenomenon: either the atom at\nthe outer edge leaps over some of the intervening atomic cells, or the\natom at the hub rests at some of the atomic cells for a few moments\nwhile the atom at the outer edge catches up. The preferred atomist\nsolution to differences in velocity was to posit that slower moving\nobjects have a greater number of intervallic rests than faster moving\nobjects; however, al-Naz\u0323z\u0323\u0101]m disallowed this solution with respect to\nthe rotating millstone on the grounds that in that case the millstone\nwould fragment as certain atoms rest while others keep moving. In\nother words, some atoms that at the beginning of the motion had been\nnext to other atoms would have moved away from each other as the ones\nnearer the rim kept moving in order to cover the greater distance and\nthe ones nearer the hub rested in order to cover only their respective\ndistance, and so by the atom\u2019s moving away from each other, the\nmillstone as a whole would fragment and break up. Yet, argued\nal-Naz\u0323z\u0323\u0101m, it is directly observable that the stone does not fragment,\nand thus even the atomists must be committed to leaps. (For a discussion of al-Naz\u0323z\u0323\u0101m\u2019s theory of leaps and possible historical sources available to him see Chase (2019).)\n",
