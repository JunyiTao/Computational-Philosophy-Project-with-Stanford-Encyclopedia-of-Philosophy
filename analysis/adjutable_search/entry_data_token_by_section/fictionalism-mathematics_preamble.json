    "main_text": "\n\nMathematical fictionalism (hereafter, simply fictionalism) is\nbest thought of as a reaction to mathematical platonism. Platonism is\nthe view that (a) there exist abstract mathematical objects (i.e.,\nnonspatiotemporal mathematical objects), and (b) our mathematical\nsentences and theories provide true descriptions of such objects. So,\nfor instance, on the platonist view, the sentence \u20183 is\nprime\u2019 provides a straightforward description of a certain\nobject\u2014namely, the number 3\u2014in much the same way that the\nsentence \u2018Mars is red\u2019 provides a description of Mars. But\nwhereas Mars is a physical object, the number 3 is (according to\nplatonism) an abstract object. And abstract objects,\nplatonists tell us, are wholly nonphysical, nonmental, nonspatial,\nnontemporal, and noncausal. Thus, on this view, the number 3 exists\nindependently of us and our thinking, but it does not exist in space\nor time, it is not a physical or mental object, and it does not enter\ninto causal relations with other objects. This view has been endorsed\nby Plato, Frege (1884, 1893\u20131903, 1919), G\u00f6del (1964), and\nin some of their writings, Russell (1912) and Quine (1948, 1951), not\nto mention numerous more recent philosophers of mathematics, e.g.,\nPutnam (1971), Parsons (1971), Steiner (1975), Resnik (1997), Shapiro\n(1997), Hale (1987), Wright (1983), Katz (1998), Zalta (1988), Colyvan\n(2001), McEvoy (2012), and Marcus (2015).\n\nFictionalism, on the other hand, is the view that (a) our mathematical\nsentences and theories do purport to be about abstract mathematical\nobjects, as platonism suggests, but (b) there are no such things as\nabstract objects, and so (c) our mathematical theories are not true.\nThus, the idea is that sentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019 are\nfalse, or untrue, for the same reason that, say, \u2018The tooth\nfairy is generous\u2019 is false or untrue\u2014because just as\nthere is no such person as the tooth fairy, so too there is no such\nthing as the number 3. It is important to note, however, that despite\nthe name, fictionalist views do not have to involve any very strong\nclaims about the analogy between mathematics and fiction. For\ninstance, there is no claim here that mathematical discourse is a kind\nof fictional discourse. Thus, fictionalists are not committed to the\nthesis that there are no important disanalogies between mathematics\nand fiction. (We will return to this issue below, in section 2.4.)\nFinally, it should also be noted at the start that fictionalism is a\nversion of mathematical nominalism, the view that there are\nno such things as mathematical objects.\n\nFictionalism was first introduced by Field (1980, 1989, 1998, 2016).\nSince then, the view has been developed\u2014in a few different\nways\u2014by Balaguer (1996a, 1998a, 2001, 2009), Rosen (2001), Yablo\n(2002a, 2002b, 2005), Leng (2005a, 2005b, 2010), and Bueno (2009),\nthough as will become clear below, one might question whether Bueno\nand Yablo are best interpreted as fictionalists. Others to endorse or\ndefend fictionalism (or views in the neighborhood of fictionalism)\ninclude Daly (2006), Liggins (2010), Contessa (2016), and Plebani\n(2018). Finally, one might also interpret Melia (2000) as defending a\nfictionalist view, though he doesn\u2019t really commit to this.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Hoffman (2004) also endorses a view that\nis a kind of fictionalism. Her view is very different from the\nfictionalist view defined above, however, because it doesn\u2019t\ninvolve a commitment to thesis (a). She reinterprets mathematics along\nthe lines of Kitcher (1984) and then endorses a fictionalist view of\nthis reinterpretation; i.e., she maintains that once mathematics is\nreinterpreted in this way, it\u2019s singular terms fail to refer and\nits sentences are not true. (It\u2019s not clear how much this view\ndiffers from Kitcher\u2019s view; one might interpret Kitcher as\nendorsing a very similar view.) In any event, it is important to note\nthat Hoffman\u2019s rejection of thesis (a) makes her view radically\ndifferent from more standard fictionalist views. As will become clear\nbelow, thesis (a) is very plausible, and its plausibility is one of\nthe main reasons for the popularity of platonism. Thus, one of the\nmain selling points of fictionalism\u2014i.e., the standard sort of\nfictionalism defined above\u2014is that it combines an acceptance of\nthesis (a) with an anti-platonistic ontology.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Lear (1982) and Corkum (2012) argue\nthat Aristotle held a version of mathematical fictionalism; but as\nCorkum notes, it\u2019s unlikely that Aristotle held the version of\nfictionalism defined above. \n\nWhen one first hears the fictionalist hypothesis, it can seem a bit\ncrazy. Are we really supposed to believe that sentences like \u20183\nis prime\u2019 and \u20182 + 2 = 4\u2019 are false? But\nthe appeal of fictionalism starts to emerge when we realize what the\nalternatives are. By thinking carefully about the issues surrounding\nthe interpretation of mathematical discourse, it can start to seem\nthat fictionalism is actually very plausible, and indeed, that it\nmight just be the least crazy view out there.\n\nSection 1 provides a formulation of what might be thought of as the\ncentral argument for fictionalism. Section 2 provides a discussion of\na number of different objections to fictionalism, as well as a number\nof different versions of fictionalism. These two things go\ntogether very naturally, because the different versions of\nfictionalism have emerged in connection with the responses that\ndifferent philosophers have given to the various objections to\nfictionalism.\n",
