    "preamble": "\n\nIn its broadest sense, kokugaku has been used to refer to\nscholarship that takes Japan as its focus instead of China. In the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries, however, it came to refer more\nnarrowly to the effort to discern a native Way distinct from Buddhism\nand Confucianism within Japan\u2019s most ancient writings, and to\nthe attendant effort to resurrect that Way in the present. Most\nscholars agree on the major leaders of these studies during the\nTokugawa period, with Motoori Norinaga (1730\u20131801) thought to be\nits greatest intellectual and Hirata Atsutane (1776\u20131843) its\nmost effective popularizer.\n\nMotoori Norinaga saw the roots of the discipline in\nKeich\u016b\u2019s (1640\u20131701) use of historical linguistics to\nanalyze the eighth-century collection of poems called\nMan\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b, whereas Atsutane found it in the\nJapanese-studies academic efforts of Kada no Azumamaro\n(1669\u20131736). Both included Kamo no Mabuchi (1697\u20131769) in\ntheir list of founders. In any case, after Hirata Atsutane, the\nlineage of Kokugaku\u2019s leaders became more complex as the new\nMeiji state used Kokugaku notions of racial identity and cultural\nsuperiority to mobilize support for Japan\u2019s nationalist ideology\nand purported international destiny. After 1945 such notions of racial\nidentity and cultural superiority were briefly considered taboo and\nreplaced by less toxic arguments regarding Japanese uniqueness, though\nthese too have morphed yet again into the broad category of\nNihonjinron, \u201ctheories of Japaneseness\u201d which is\na major strain within contemporary Japanese popular culture.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Matters of Definition\n\nThe Japanese word kokugaku has been variously translated into\nEnglish and this makes simple definition difficult. English terms like\n\u2018Japan Studies\u2019, \u2018National Learning/Studies\u2019,\n\u2018nativism\u2019 and \u2018essentialism\u2019 all have their\nadvocates.  One approach is to think of kokugaku as having\nbroad and narrow meanings. Scholarship of all sorts expanded\ndramatically in Japan during the seventeenth century spurred on by\nrelative tranquility, and increasing levels of prosperity and\nliteracy. Alongside the more traditional studies of China, there arose\nnew historical studies of things Japanese\u2014history, literature,\nphilology, poetics, customs, mythology, the tradition of kami\nworship and so on. Collectively those forms of Japanese studies can be\nthought of as kokugaku in the broad sense. \n\nMore narrowly, some of these studies in the eighteenth century came to\nfocus on Japanese distinctiveness principally vis a vis China, which\nwas now posited as an Other whose historical influence on Japan was\nconstrued as harmful. In the nineteenth century the frame of reference\nexpanded to include Europe and the world as a whole. This nativist\nessentialism was also sometimes called kokugaku, and it came\nto be the crucible in which Japanese identity was forged. One\ninterpretation was that to be Japanese was to partake in an intuitive\nconformity with the rhythms of nature, and to possess an untutored\nheart-mind that fostered the ancient arcadia. Yet another\ninterpretation was that the Japanese people were descended from and as\nvaried as the innumerable kami, some good and some bad, but\nunmistakably blessed when taken as a whole. \n\nStrictly speaking, Kokugaku during the Tokugawa period\n(1600\u20131868) was neither a movement nor a school but rather a\nsuccession of schools\u2014private academies\u2014that had their own\ndistinctive orientations and specialties, and in the analysis that\nfollows we will begin by following the lead of Japanese scholarship by\nseeing the essence of Kokugaku in the writings of its Tokugawa-era\nparagons: Keich\u016b, Azumamaro, Mabuchi, Norinaga, and Atsutane.\n\n\nAfter the Meiji Restoration of 1868 Kokugaku became an ideologically\ncharged academic field that was harnessed to create empire and\nimperial subjects at home and abroad. It also spawned related\nenquiries into folklore and ethnography. Following Japan\u2019s\nmilitary defeat and during the Allied Occupation 1945\u201352, aside\nfrom a handful of places such as Kokugaku-in University, Kokugaku was\nstripped of its imperial and spiritual coloring, leaving behind\nsterilized notions of what was asserted to be uniquely Japanese about\nJapan and its people. From roughly the 1980s these came to be grouped\nunder the rubric Nihonjinron or theories of Japaneseness,\nreintroducing a spiritual component that can be seen in the animism\ncharacteristic of much anime and \u201csoft power\u201d\ndiplomacy. As a result, the word kokugaku is no longer used\nin contemporary discourse to refer to present-day nativist or\nessentialist scholarship. \n2. The Emergence of Kokugaku\n2.1 Keich\u016b (1640\u20131701)\n\nBecause the preeminent Motoori Norinaga located a genesis for his own\nstudies in the scholarship of Keich\u016b, most students of Kokugaku\ntoday accept Keich\u016b as at least its forerunner. Keich\u016b had a\nsolidly samurai pedigree, though his father and grandfather fared\npoorly after 1600 under the new Tokugawa regime. He had a rigorous\nearly education supervised by his mother, and at the age of 12 to\nfulfill a parental vow began the ten-year path to ordination in the\nShingon Buddhist priesthood, becoming a high priest (Ajari)\nin 1663. \n\nKeich\u016b developed an interest in traditional waka,\n(31-syllable) Japanese verse, including the verses in Japan\u2019s\nmost ancient extant poetry anthology, the eighth-century\nMan\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b. One feature of seventeenth-century\nJapanese poetics was an awakening interest in the anthology, but only\nabout 10% of its 4400 poems were accessible to Keich\u016b\u2019s\ncontemporaries owing to the arcane method of its original\ntranscription. To remedy this lacuna the Daimyo of Mito commissioned a\ncommentary, the responsibility for which, in a roundabout fashion,\ndevolved upon Keich\u016b. It was for that philological work that he\nremains best known.\n\nIn terms of the Kokugaku tradition, three factors stand out in terms\nof why later Kokugakusha (native studies scholars) came to\nsee him as a pioneer of their own work. First was Keich\u016b\u2019s\nnear-mystical reverence for waka. By tradition waka\nwere thought to be an invention of the kami rendering them\nultimately beyond human ken, and Keich\u016b felt this numinous\nquality intensely. Second was the relative sophistication of\nKeich\u016b\u2019s philology, which balanced historical linguistic\nanalysis with an intuitive sense of the meaning behind the text. Later\nscholars attributed this to Keich\u016b\u2019s earlier study of\nSanskrit as part of his study for the Shingon Buddhist priesthood. And\nthird was his representation of the ancient pre-Buddhist and\npre-Confucian past as the \u201cland of the kami\u201d\n(shinkoku) characterized by a simple self-sufficiency rooted\nin the native Way.\n\nAs Keich\u016b wrote in his commentary on the\nMan\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b:\n\n\nJapan is the land of the kami. Therefore in both our\nhistories and our government administration, we have always given\npriority to the kami and always placed humans second. In high\nantiquity, our rulers governed this land exclusively by means of\nShinto\u2026, and there was no philosophizing of the sort one finds\nin Confucian classics and Buddhist writings. (c. 1690,\nMan\u2019y\u014d daish\u014dki: zassetsu, adapted from SJTa:\n395) \n\n\nAdditionally in his later retirement from active priesthood\nKeich\u016b produced a number of studies of Japan\u2019s other major\npoetry anthologies, treatises on ancient Japanese language, and\nstudies of the emergent canon of literary and historical prose works,\nall of which resonated with the topics taught in later Kokugaku\nacademies.\n2.2 Kada no Azumamaro (1666\u20131736)\n\nRaised in the environment of the Inari Shinto Shrine in Fushimi just\nsouth of Kyoto, Azumamaro moved to Edo in 1700 lecturing on Shinto\ntopics to a small school of mostly priests, and establishing a\nreputation as an authority on antiquarian matters. Perhaps inspired by\nIt\u014d Jinsai\u2019s success during the 1680s in establishing a\nConfucian private academy in Kyoto, and also perhaps by the Hayashi\nfamily\u2019s success in garnering Bakufu support for a Confucian\nacademy in Edo, Azumamaro also sought potential sponsors for his dream\nof founding a school dedicated to Japanese studies.\n\nReturning to Fushimi and the Shrine in 1713, Azumamaro\u2019s later\nwritings spanned the entire range of what would become the Kokugaku\ncurriculum: commentaries on prose and poetry classics, studies of\nancient histories (especially the 720 CE Nihon shoki),\nhistorical linguistics, and antiquarian matters generally. The core of\nhis scholarship, however, was Shinto and Shinto-related topics.\nAzumamaro\u2019s focus was on the most ancient texts, seeking to\ndisentangle the Shinto of his day from centuries of Buddhist\nsyncretism and, less successfully, more recent decades of\nConfucianized Shinto. Nonetheless, he did champion Shinto and its\nancient links with the monarchy as the native Japanese Way, the\nessence of Japaneseness, and the principal factor behind the\nhistorical stability of the Japanese polity.\n\nAzumamaro\u2019s contributions to later Kokugaku lie in the Shinto\ntone he set, the methodology of historical linguistics he championed,\nthe binary opposition with Chinese studies he established, the\ninstitutional development of the nativist private academy, and the\naccomplishments of his students. \n\nMany scholars credit Azumamaro with petitioning the Bakufu in 1728 to\nfound a school of Kokugaku. Though nothing came of it, the Petition\nrepresents a succinct statement of Kokugaku\u2019s aims and the Kada\nSchool\u2019s vigorous rationale for it:\n\n\nAlas, how ignorant the Confucian scholars were of the past, not\nknowing a single thing about the imperial Japanese learning\u2026.\nFalse doctrines are rampant, taking advantage of our weakness\u2026.\nIf the old words are not understood, the old meanings will not be\nclear. If the old meanings are not clear, the old learning will not\nrevive. The Way of the former kings is disappearing; the ideas of the\nwise men of antiquity have almost been abandoned. The loss will not be\na slight one if we fail now to teach philology. (SJTa:\n401\u2013402)\n\n\nAfter Azumamaro\u2019s death in 1736, the center of native studies\nshifted from Kyoto to Edo, where Azumamaro\u2019s scholarship was\nalready represented by his adopted son Arimaro (1706\u201351).\nArimaro was then joined in Edo by another of his father\u2019s\nstudents, Kamo no Mabuchi, whose magnum opus would be a\ncomprehensive study of Man\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b and the\neffort to glean from it an authentic ancient native Way believed to be\nencoded within its verses.\n3. Philological Kokugaku\n3.1 Kamo no Mabuchi 1697\u20131769\n\nMabuchi was raised in Hamamatsu along the roadway linking Kyoto and\nEdo. Taught to read by Kada no Azumamaro\u2019s niece, he developed\nan early interest in Shinto and waka, which would become for\nhim an escapist passion. In 1728 he registered in Azumamaro\u2019s\nschool and moved there for full time study in 1733, which is where he\nreceived his introduction to the Man\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b\nincluding Keich\u016b\u2019s commentary and the full range of\nKokugaku topics taught there.\n\nMabuchi moved to Edo in 1737 and in 1746 replaced Kada Arimaro as the\nauthority on Japanese studies in service to Tayasu Munetake, the\nyounger brother of the feeble regnant shogun, a position Mabuchi\nretained until 1760. Mabuchi produced essays on a range of topics, but\nthe focus of his study during these years was a philological analysis\nof the Man\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b through which he believed\none could learn the words and spirit (kokoro) of Japan before\nthese were Sinified and thereby corrupted during the Nara period of\nthe eighth century. Mabuchi depicted the Japan of the\nMan\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b as a natural arcadia ruled by the\ndescendants of the kami who governed in accordance with a Way\n(michi) that conformed to the natural rhythms and dictates of\nnature (literally, \u201cheaven and earth\u201d) itself:\n\n\nFrom the time when the imperial court was at \u014ctsu in \u014cmi\nthrough the period of the Fujiwara court at Yamato, grand august\ngovernment filled the heavens and reached to every nook and cranny of\nthe earth; and thanks to this glorious tranquility, literary\nexpression was blessed with beauty and elegance. (Engishiki norito\nkai jo, KKMZ:SH 1: 446 author translation)\n\n\nRetirement from service to Munetake in 1760 made Mabuchi less prone to\nthe charge of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9, and he was free to\ngive rein to the implications of his earlier study. He began to\ndescribe his current age as one that had declined since ancient times\nbecause the old natural virtues had been crushed and catastrophically\nreplaced by the artificial morals of China:\n\n\nAncient Japan was governed well in accordance with the spirit of\nheaven and earth, and there was none of this petty sophistry; but then\nsuddenly when these convincing theories were imported from China,\nancient men in their straightforward fashion took these theories as\ntruth, and the theories spread far and wide\u2026. [and no sooner\nwere these theories introduced \u2026 than tremendous chaos erupted.\n(Kokui k\u014d, SJTa: 406)\n\n\nHe taught that if one will advance to the stage of being able to\nrecite the most ancient Man\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b verses\naloud, one will be affected to the point where only one\u2019s body\nremains mired in the here-and-now, as one\u2019s language and heart\n(kokoro) are transported back to the ancient past. In the\nprocess one will spontaneously acquire the virtues of that\npast\u2014truthfulness, directness, manliness, vitality, and native\nelegance\u2014which were the antithesis of the notoriously corrupt\npolitical culture of his times. He also became virulently\nanti-Chinese, insisting that the absence of native Japanese words for\nthe classic Confucian virtues was evidence that such teachings were\nunnecessary in ancient Japan when life enjoyed a morally and ethically\nuntutored order rooted in its conformity to the natural rhythms of\nheaven and earth.\n\nMabuchi began lecturing to hundreds of students, many of whom would\ngather by the veranda of his home on the fringes of Edo. His was the\nfirst successful Kokugaku private academy\u2014others would\nfollow\u2014and he was also a notorious antiquarian eccentric; years\nafter his death in 1769, Mabuchi\u2019s biography was the opening\nentry in Ban K\u014dkei\u2019s celebrated 1790 study of contemporary\neccentrics. Of his roughly three hundred students, none would achieve\ngreater renown as a scholar of Kokugaku than Motoori Norinaga, who\nonly met Mabuchi on one fateful evening in 1763 when Mabuchi stayed\nthe night in Matsusaka on a tour of Japan. \n3.2 Motoori Norinaga 1730\u20131801\n\nMotoori Norinaga made pioneering and lasting contributions in all\naspects of Kokugaku: he elevated literary criticism on The Tale of\nGenji to new heights, with an impact that endures into the\npresent; his magnum opus was a philological analysis of and\ncomplete commentary on the 712 CE Kojiki, which was the last\nof Japan\u2019s most ancient classics to be linguistically\ndeciphered; and he used that analysis to construct a new form of Shinto, the kami no michi or Way\nof the kami (deities) that he claimed to be the original. Furthermore, his\nscholarship was known to Kyoto courtiers, and his counsel sought\nby daimyo. Remarkably Norinaga accomplished all this while spending\nalmost his entire life in Matsusaka in the virtual shadow of the Ise\nShrines.\n\nNorinaga applied the concept of mono no aware (the\nsadness/pity of things) to The Tale of Genji as well as to\nthe waka of the Shin Kokinsh\u016b poetry anthology,\nworks that his teacher Mabuchi eschewed because of their alleged\nfemininity and artifice in contrast to the\nMan\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b\u2019s natural masculinity.\nNorinaga, by contrast, argued that The Tale of Genji\nrealistically depicts how emotions profoundly infuse life\u2019s\nmajor events, and how this contributed to the novel\u2019s uncanny\nability to inspire its readers to suspend didactic or moralistic\ninterpretation and instead to enter emotionally into the tenth-century\nworld that was its setting. From this perspective, when a character in\nGenji acts or emotes in a certain way, the reader is invited\nnot to enquire into the Confucian moral or ethical propriety of the events\ndepicted, but rather into whether the reader has ever shared the\nexperience. This also overturned centuries of didactic Buddhist criticism\nof the novel on the grounds that it failed to praise good and condemn\nevil, and to show evil\u2019s consequences. So Norinaga\u2019s\napproach opened the door to a more modern literary criticism. In his\nwords: \n\n\nThe novel is neither like the Buddhist Way\u2026 nor like the\nConfucian Way\u2026. It is simply a tale of human life that leaves\naside and does not profess to take up at all the questions of good and\nbad and that dwells only on the goodness of those who are aware of the\nsorrow of human existence. (Tama no ogushi, SJTa: 421)\n\n\nIn an analogous manner, Norinaga extolled the elegance and refinement\n(miyabiyaka) of the verses of Shin Kokinsh\u016b.\nThis, he explained, was the consequence of its many poets\u2019\nability to detach sufficiently from their individual circumstances so that\nthrough their artistry (waza) they could capture the essence\nof mono no aware in just thirty-one syllables. This\nappreciation of poetic sophistication also desanctified waka\nfrom the cosmological significance that Mabuchi had attached to the\noldest Japanese verses.\n\nNorinaga\u2019s work on Kojiki formed the basis for his\nunderstanding of Japan\u2019s Way of the kami (kami no\nmichi, or in its Sino-Japanese reading Shint\u014d).\nWith his fundamentalist confidence in the text as a True Book\n(makoto no fumi) Norinaga argued that, as described in\nKojiki, the native Way of Japan was a Way created not by\nhumans like the imported Chinese Ways, but by the native kami\nwho are ultimately responsible for all human action and activity. And,\nbecause of the centrality of kami to Norinaga\u2019s\nthoughts on a native Japanese Way, Kokugaku has at times been referred\nto as a Shinto Revival. \n\nNorinaga\u2019s definition of the notoriously difficult term\nkami was more comprehensive than that of any of his\npredecessors in Kokugaku and has stood the test of time:\n\n\n\u2026the word kami signifies first the deities of heaven\nand earth who appear in the ancient records and the spirits of the\nshrines where they are worshiped. It is unnecessary to add that it\nincludes birds and beasts, trees and plants, seas and mountains, and\nso forth. In ancient usage, anything whatsoever which was outside the\nordinary, which possessed superior power or was awe-inspiriting was\ncalled kami\u2026. Evil and mysterious things, if they are\nextraordinary and dreadful, are also called kami, and among\nhuman beings who are called kami, the successive generations\nof divine emperors are all included. (Kojiki-den\n adapted from Holtom, 1938, quoted in SJT, 2001, 18.) \n\n\nIn this kami-determined world, people are as varied as the\n\u201ceight million\u201d kami, who are themselves some\ngood and some wicked:\n\n\nThe true heart (magokoro) is that heart with which one is\nborn by virtue of the Musubi (creating) kami, and among true\nhearts some are wise and some clumsy, some are good and some\nbad\u2026. Thus even the kami of the divine age were some\ngood and some bad, for they all behaved in accordance with their\nindividual true hearts. (Kuzubana {1968\u20131975: 8:\n147]\n\n\nThis allowed for an acceptance of individual difference, but it also\ninhibited any doctrine of personal, moral and ethical responsibility.\n\n\nBecause of the all-pervasive influence of kami and the fact\nthat the operations of the kami are beyond human ken, the\nworld always retains a wondrous quality and is never fully\nknowable:\n\n\nConsider the human body: It has eyes to see, ears to hear, a mouth to\nspeak, feet to walk, and hands to do a thousand things. Are they not\ntruly wonderful? Birds and insects fly in the sky, plants and trees\nbloom and bear fruit\u2014they are all wonderful\u2026. Thus the\nuniverse and all things therein are without a single exception strange\nand wondrous when examined carefully\u2026. [And] one must\nacknowledge that human intelligence is puny while the acts of the\nkami are illimitable and wondrous. (Kuzubana\n{1968\u20131975: 8: 160]\n\n\nAll one can know with certainty, according to Norinaga, is what is\nrecorded in the Divine Age chapters of Kojiki, and this text\nrendered the Divine Age proximate and no longer remote as it was for\nMabuchi. One\u2019s human responsibility is to act\nkannagara, i.e., in conformity to the wishes of the\nkami, and Norinaga cast the monarch (tenn\u014d) in\nKyoto as the physical link in a metaphysical chain that connected the\nJapanese people with the solar deity Amaterasu. For Norinaga,\nAmaterasu was both sun goddess and the sun itself, and so the world as\na whole owed a daily debt of gratitude to this quintessential Japanese\ndeity for the very gift of solar warmth and light. Beyond this\nNorinaga claimed that on the basis of Japanese mythology, Japan was\nthe primal source of all the world\u2019s countries compounding the\nworld\u2019s obligation to Japan.\n\nFor Norinaga, the native Japanese Heart (mikunigokoro) is\ndamaged in every generation by contaminating exposure to Chinese\nmoralism as represented especially by Confucianism; in its place an\ninferior Chinese Heart takes shape with the same deleterious effects\nin Japan as what Norinaga claimed one could observe in Chinese\nhistory. As he expressed this in verse:\n\n\nThough he may think himself\n Karagokoro\n\nRid of the Chinese heart\n nashi to omoedo\n\nThe heart of a man\n fumira yomu\n\nWho reads Chinese\n hito no kokoro wa\n\nIs still Chinese\n nao zo Kara naru. \n\n(adapted from\nMuraoka 1964: 148)\n\n\nThe way to purify and reanimate one\u2019s Japanese Heart was not\nthrough the medium of an ancient text like\nMan\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b, but rather through exorcising\nChinese contamination through the mediation of the kami.\n\nToward the end of his life Norinaga composed a liturgy for personal\nmorning worship, which was his way of elevating his thoughts on\nJapan\u2019s native ancient Way into something approaching a\ncontemporary religion. If Norinaga was constrained in this regard,\nhowever, it was by Kojiki itself, which depicted life after\ndeath as an uninviting eternity in the depraved and polluted nether\nworld called Yomi. As he expressed this in verse:\n\n\nPolluted Yomi\n Kitanakuni\n\nBourne of darkness\u2014\n yomi no kunibe\n\nHow dirty and disgusting!\n inashikome\n\nI want to stay in this world\n chi yo toko to wa ni\n\nA thousand ages evermore!\n kono yonomogamo. \n\n(adapted from\nMuraoka 1964: 151)\n\n\nIt is perhaps unsurprising that after Norinaga\u2019s death the\norientation of his school inclined toward the literary. There were no\nmajor texts from Japan\u2019s ancient past that required deciphering,\nand the linguistic challenges to such enquiries were prohibitively\ndifficult for Kokugaku to reach a broader audience. The mantle to the\nmore religious side of his Kokugaku was, in turn, claimed by a student\nwhom Norinaga never met.\n4. Popular and Grassroots Kokugaku 1800\u20131868\n4.1 Hirata Atsutane (1776\u20131843)\n\nHirata Atsutane hailed from Japan\u2019s northeast and moved to Edo\nin 1795 at age 19. He had not even heard of Motoori Norinaga until two\nyears after his death, but his introduction to Norinaga\u2019s\nthought so moved him that two years after that he was admitted to\nNorinaga\u2019s school, which was being run by Norinaga\u2019s son\nHaruniwa. Throughout his future career Atsutane distinguished himself\nfrom his more philologically oriented forebears in Kokugaku by seeking\nverification for his views in the broadest range of places, including\nConfucian and even Christian sources, which he disguised by making\nthem appear Shinto-based. Atsutane even sought the testimony of those\nwho claimed astral travel, reincarnation, and supernatural pedigree in\nsupport of his understandings. This can be understood as his effort to\nuniversalize Shinto, which he styled True Shinto (makoto no\nshint\u014d) by representing it as the fountainhead from which\nderivative and inferior foreign doctrines later emerged. This\nxenophobia together with his vast array of subjects of inquiry ranging\nfrom spiritual matters and kami worship to folklore likely contributed\nto the popularity of his teachings which he intended \u201cto touch a\nperson\u2019s heart\u201d (from Kod\u014d taii, HAZ: vol.\n1, ch.1, 15). \n\nAtsutane championed the pleasures of the here-and-now\u2014good food\nand wine, love and sexual passion\u2014even querying why some long\nfor the afterlife when the present is so blissful. Like Kamo no\nMabuchi and Motoori Norinaga, Atsutane\u2019s Kokugaku included the\nbelief that persons in Japan are endowed as a birthright with True\nHearts (magokoro) that make possible spontaneous conformity\nto the Way of the kami and restoration of an ancient social\nperfection in the present. Through prayer to specific deities, one\ncould \u201clearn from the kami\u201d (kaminarai) in a\nmanner that did not even require literacy. \n\nRegarding the ancient past, Atsutane made a number of claims that went\nwell beyond the near-paradisiac constructions of Kamo no Mabuchi and\nMotoori Norinaga, including perfect health (and ironic invention of\nthe presumably unneeded Way of Medicine); an ancient native script\nprior to the incorporation of Chinese characters; population in\nancient times by a race of Japanese giants; and the argument that the\nrest of the world was fashioned from inferior materials leftover after\nthe pristine creation of Japan. At their worst these expressions of\nsuperiority became unsavory racialized critiques of Others who now\nincluded Europeans.\n\nAtsutane endeavored to recast Motoori Norinaga\u2019s gloomy\nassessment of what befalls humans when their earthly bodies perish.\nWhere Norinaga followed Kojiki in presuming Yomi as the\nsoul\u2019s final resting spot, Atsutane taught that humans all\nbecome kami who proceed to a concealed world that in its\nessential aspects resembles the revealed world of the living. Atsutane\ntook this eschatology a step further by extrapolating implications for\nthe polity. \n\nAtsutane repeatedly insisted upon Japan\u2019s and the Japanese\npeople\u2019s superiority to other countries and peoples:\n\n\nSince Japan has no match among other countries, and since both\nmaterially and in terms of human affairs it is superior to all other\ncountries, the people of this land, because it is a divine land, have\nbeen automatically endowed with true hearts which since ancient times\nhave been known as the \u201cJapanese heart\u201d (Yamato\ngokoro) or \u201cJapanese spirit\u201d (Yamato\ndamashii; from Kod\u014d taii, HAZ: vol. 1, ch.1,\n3).\n\n\nTo Atsutane this in turn had implications for Japan\u2019s destiny in\nthe world: because Japan is \n\n\nthe ancestral country of the ten thousand countries\u2026 our great\nruler is the great ruler of the ten thousand countries\u2026, and\nthe nature of the peace of mind that this provides is likewise\nsuperior to the peace of mind provided by other lands. (from Tama\nno mihashira, HAZ: vol. 2, ch.1, 89) \n\n\nBefore Atsutane, Shinto theologians and Kokugaku scholars said\nrelatively little about the afterlife for human beings. Norinaga had\nconcluded that after death everyone was destined to go to the filthy\nand unpleasant land of Yomi beneath the earth. In his seminal work,\nAugust Pillar of the Soul (Tama no mihashira) which\nhe completed in 1812, however, Atsutane asserts the importance of\nknowing the destination of human souls after death and, thereby, made\neschatology central to Kokugaku scholarship. Atsutane criticized his\nteacher Norinaga for having overlooked the evidence on the matter.\nAfter death human souls go neither to heaven nor the Yomi underworld,\naccording to Atsutane, but rather it is certain concerning the souls\nof the Japanese, \n\n\nfrom the purport of ancient legends and from modern examples that they\nremain eternally in Japan and serve in the realm of the dead governed\nby \u014ckuninushi-no-kami. (Tama no mihashira in SJT: 45)\n\n\n\nThis, in turn, had implications for the polity, since in the revealed\nworld one is subject to the emperor, but in the concealed world one\nbecomes a ghostly spirit, and one\u2019s loyalty transfers to\n\u014ckuninushi-no-kami. Traditionally, this deity had been worshiped\nas an \u201cearthly god\u201d (kunitsu kami) and ruler over\nthe Central Land of Reed Plains (Ashihara no nakatsu kuni),\nand yet Atsutane identified \u014ckuninushi as lord of the\nkakuriyo realm whom souls of the dead were expected to serve\nfaithfully. Atsutane describes the spiritual realm of\ny\u016bmeikai or kakuriyo\n(\u5e7d\u51a5\u754c\uff0f\u5e7d\u51a5) as dark and,\ntherefore, invisible to those inhabiting the world of the living,\nthough those in the spiritual realm could freely see the realm of the\nliving. Because the invisible kakuriyo and visible realm of\nthe living occupied common space, it was believed that souls of the\ndead dwelt near graves or shrines from where they watched over and\noffered protection to their surviving descendants.\n\nIn his concern with eschatology, fertility, the affective realm, the\nsupernatural and cosmology, Atsutane moved Kokugaku in distinctively\nreligious directions, and by jettisoning the arduous philological\nexegesis of forebears like Kamo no Mabuchi and Motoori Norinaga,\nAtsutane made the nativist spirituality of Kokugaku immeasurably more\naccessible, with a special appeal directed toward the farmers who\ncomprised some 80% of the population during his lifetime.\n4.2 Kokugaku in the Kuni (Provinces)\nMiyahiro Sadao (1797\u20131858)\n\nThe Hirata academy had attracted over 500 disciples during\nAtsutane\u2019s lifetime and over 4,200 total disciples by the early\nyears of the Meiji period including posthumous disciples who had\njoined after the master\u2019s death in 1843. One of the major\ncenters of Hirata disciples was in Shim\u014dsa province of\ntoday\u2019s northern Chiba and Ibaraki prefectures, whose\nregistrants numbered over 200 by the time of the Meiji Restoration.\nMembers of the Hirata family visited Shim\u014dsa\u2014Atsutane gave\nlectures, while adopted son and administrator of the academy, Hirata\nKanetane (1799\u20131880), raised funds for publishing.\n\nThe result was the recruitment of many disciples, including Miyahiro\nSadao (1797\u20131858) who himself registered with the academy in\n1826. Sadao had overcome excessive drinking and corruption and\ntransformed himself into a hardworking and respected village headman\n(nanushi) of Matsuzawa village. A self-proclaimed\n\u201cpotato-digging headman\u201d, Sadao reclaimed agricultural\nland, repaired roads, and grew medicinal herbs. Later that same year\nof 1826, the Hirata family began to publish several agricultural\nmanuals beginning with Sadao\u2019s Essentials on\nAgriculture or N\u014dgy\u014d y\u014dsh\u016b, which\noffers instruction to farmers on the practice and profitability of\nplanting. The Hirata academy facilitated the publishing of hundreds of\ncopies of such farming manuals to meet a growing demand in\nagricultural communities, while Sadao and other disciples contributed\ncapital. Records of Plant Seed Selection or S\u014dmoku\ntane erami, also authored by Sadao, explains plant gender and\nargues that planting female seeds would lead to a large harvest.\n\nIn 1832, Sadao completed Thesis on National Profit or\nKokueki honron. For the sake of the national economy, Sadao\nuses Atsutane\u2019s teachings as a call to revere and worship\nthe kishin spirits, who have the will and power to create\nprosperity but, when angered, will become wrathful and bring about\nmisfortune (KH: 292). He writes:\n\n\nFirst, a country\u2019s decline is the result of people\u2019s being\nunjust in mind and carrying out crooked behavior, as well as staining\ntheir minds, staining their bodies, and staining their households. It\nis a result of them turning their backs on the hearts of\nkishin spirits of heaven and earth and, thereby, escaping\ntheir grace. Moreover, in years of bad harvest and famine, or\nencountering calamities such as fires and epidemic, people dwindle and\ntheir fortunes shrink. A country\u2019s decline all results from such\nrebuke from the kishin spirits. (KH: 292)\n\n\nAtsutane is credited for popularizing Kokugaku among agriculturalists\nacross rural Japan by linking their mundane farm work with the Ancient\nWay, valuing their labor as service to the gods. In Matsuzawa, Sadao\nwas one Hirata follower whose writings and leadership equated\nagriculturalist labor of the peasant masses with sacred service to the\ngods.\n\nAccording to Sadao, another key to achieving the goal of national\nprosperity was to educate peasants. He laments the state and\navailability of agricultural education:\n\n\nFurthermore, knowledge or ignorance in agriculture, or the skill or\nlack of skill greatly affects a country\u2019s profit and loss.\nTherefore, I say, \u201cagriculture is the foundation of the\ncountry\u201d, because it is an industry which cannot be neglected.\nYet, the general tendency is that there are few skilled\nagriculturalists and many unskilled farmers. This is precisely because\nthere are no expert agricultural teachers. If those lords\n(ry\u014dshu) issued orders, and selected agriculturalists\nknowledgeable about horticulture and appointed them as agricultural\nteachers who educated those unskilled farmers, this would surely\ncontribute to that national profit. (KH: 292)\n\n\nAs an experienced farmer himself, Sadao asserts the need for proper\ntraining, and the farming manuals he wrote and helped to publish were\nmeant to contribute to this purpose.\n\nThe influence of Hirata Atsutane\u2019s theories on the invisible\nkakuriyo realm of spirits as articulated in the August\nPillar of the Spirit (Tama no mihashira) and New\nTreatise on Spirits (Kishin shinron) surfaces in\nSadao\u2019s writings. Sadao reaffirms the theories asserted by\nAtsutane that divine spirits which dwell and act in the\nkakuriyo realm also intervene in the lives of the people\nliving in this visible world (arahaniyo). Sadao observes that\nthe kami look upon human beings and see their good and bad, unjust and\njust, and even perceive the thoughts within their minds. He points to\nthe ancient accounts of the divine age which state that good things\nare born out of pure and bright matter, while bad things result from\nfilth. When the state is stained and the people are also stained, the\nkishin spirits are angered, and calamities result in the\nworld.\n\nSadao asserts his thesis, \n\n\nThus, when the actions of these people are rectified and are pleasing\nto the hearts of the gods so they avoid calamities, all things see no\ndecline, and the people and fortunes are abundant throughout the\ncountry. This, therefore, is the national profit. (KH: 307) \n\n\nHe advocates appointing people attuned to the Way and virtue as\nteachers to instruct local lords (my\u014dshu) and terakoya\nschool teachers on proper education, so they can then instruct the\npeople\u2014men and women, young and old. Thus, he hoped that many\nwould return to the \u201csimplicity\u201d of the ancient peoples as\ndescribed by Atsutane, live by the Way, and respond to the heavenly\nand earthly kishin spirits. This would then result in\nstability of the state, no calamity, population growth, increase in\nriches, development of lands, and robust security. This would result\nin Japan being a prosperous imperial country. Sadao asserts that\nImperial Japan would be invincible in the world and subjugate\nbarbarian nations, as it added to its own riches.\n4.3 Female Kokugakusha\nMatsuo Taseko (1811\u20131894)\n\nShinano province of present-day Nagano prefecture was home to another\nmajor agricultural community of Hirata disciples which totaled over\n630 members. This group featured one of only twenty-nine female\ndisciples who registered with the national academy. Matsuo Taseko\n(1811\u20131894) was a peasant woman of the Ina Valley who worked in\nfarming and sericulture. She was remarkably well educated in the\nJapanese classics and poetic tradition and composed waka\npoetry. Through her travels and interactions with important political\nmen, Taseko participated in significant events of the late Tokugawa\nperiod and Meiji Restoration. Following the arrival of U.S. Commodore\nMatthew C. Perry\u2019s \u201cBlack Ships\u201d and the\n\u201copening\u201d of Japan\u2019s ports to Western vessels,\nTaseko travelled to Edo in 1855 where she interacted with the Daimyo\nof the Takasu domain, Matsudaira Yoshitatsu (1824\u201383), with whom\nshe probably discussed poetry and politics. While in Kyoto for six\nmonths from 1862 to 1863, Taseko conversed with prolific Tsuwano\ndomain nativist Fukuba Bisei (1831\u20131907) and Hirata Kanetane,\nand even played a part in delivering a copy of Atsutane\u2019s\nLectures on Ancient History (Koshiden) to Lord\nSanj\u014d. In her second visit to Kyoto in 1868, Taseko used her\nconnections and influence to help samurai establish\ncredentials as imperial loyal subjects, and she eventually gained a\nposition in the household of court noble and Meiji leader, Lord\nIwakura Tomomi (1825\u201383).\n\nIt was through her waka poetry that Taseko voiced her loyalty\nto the imperial court and the cause of the Imperial Restoration. She\nexpressed her ardent patriotism in verses like the following:\n\n\nEven though I am not worthy to be counted\n Sono michi ni \n\namong the mighty warriors\n idete tsukauru \n\nwho go out to serve\n mononofu no \n\non that way\n kasunarazu tomo \n\ngraced with\n o-nakata no \n\nthe departed souls\n kami no mitama wo \n\nof the imperial ancestors\n tamawarite \n\nI shout bravely \nYamato kokoro wo \n\nto enflame\n furi okoshi \n\ntrue Japanese hearts.\n isami takebite \n\n (quoted in Walthall 1998:\n229)\n\n\nLike many of Taseko\u2019s verses, this poem expresses her reverence\nfor soldiers who served the imperial court, even to the point of\ndeath. She evokes the memory of such figures like the samurai general\nKusunoki Masashige (1294\u20131336) who in loyal support of Emperor\nGo-Daigo led his outnumbered army against the forces of Ashikaga\nTakauji at the Battle of Minatogawa in 1336. There Masashige faced\ndefeat and committed ritual suicide. Taseko joined a growing number of\nimperial loyalists in the late-Tokugawa years including fellow Hirata\ndisciples. In other verses, she lamented the sale of silk to foreign\ncountries, complaining that she would rather reject quick profits from\nforeign trade than sell silk to \u201cbarbarians\u201d.\n\nAs a poet who was well travelled and interacted with important daimyo\nleaders and courtiers, Taseko expressed her admiration for men who\ndevoted themselves to the cause of imperial loyalism, while lamenting\nthat she was held back because she was a woman:\n\n\nHow awful \n Masurao no \n\nto have the ardent heart \n kokorobayare to \n\nof a manly man \n taoyame no \n\nand the useless body \n kai naki mi koso \n\nof a weak woman. \n kanashi kari keri\n\n (quoted in Walthall 1998:\n231)\n\n\nThe Hirata academy was not known for recruiting women or actively\nwelcoming them into the school, and their percentage of female\nfollowers was significantly less than in the schools of Kamo no\nMabuchi and Motoori Norinaga. Regardless, Taseko\u2019s actions\ndemonstrate her role in the events of the Restoration, as well as\nhighlight the opportunities which the Hirata academy provided her to\ninteract with notable political figures and to have her voice heard by\nthem and her fellow Kokugaku students.\n4.4 Hirata Disciples in the Northeast\nHirao Rosen (1808\u20131880) and Tsuruya Ariyo (1808\u20131871)\n\nSituated at the northern edge of Honsh\u016b were the Tsugaru group of\nHirata disciples living in Hirosaki castle town of Hirosaki (or\nTsugaru) domain. They were among the enthusiastic followers of\nAtsutane\u2019s teachings on spirits and the spirit world of\nkakuriyo or y\u016bmeikai. Of the eighteen students\nwho registered with the academy from Hirosaki, group leader and\nmerchant-class poet Tsuruya Ariyo (1808\u201371), along with\nclassmate and friend Hirao Rosen (1808\u201380), a merchant-class\npainter and scholar, were especially interested in the realm of\nspirits that affect the visible world of human beings. \n\nRosen\u2019s most important scholarly writings are devoted to\nintroducing the strange and mysterious phenomena witnessed in his\ncastle town and neighboring villages and landscape. His New\nTreatise on the Spirit Realm (Y\u016bfu shinron)\ncompleted in 1865 cites the teachings of Atsutane on the invisible\nkakuriyo spirit realm and utilizes these to explain\npreviously inexplicable events in his community. Rosen asserts such\nobjectives of his most seminal work: \n\n\nI write all that I have collected from here and there over the years\nregarding matters of spirits (kishin), and wish to show it to\nmy friends, people who are unaware of gods (kami), and reveal\nto them the notable evidence of their great spiritual power, which\nmust be feared and respected \u2026 (from Y\u016bfu shinron,\nquoted in Fujiwara 2021: 145)\n\n\nIn New Treatise on the Spirit Realm, Rosen attributes\nsightings of the deceased to the actions of the souls of these\ndead. Moreover, he reasons that thunder and lightning are the work of\ndeities.\n\nLikewise, Ariyo relies on Atsutane\u2019s theories of the invisible\nother world to explain how human lives and the local land are governed\nby spirits. Ariyo\u2019s waka poems express reverence for\nthe deities of the Japanese tradition who protect and rule over Mount\nIwaki and the surrounding terrain. He asserts the reality of their\nspirit realm in the following verses:\n\n\nThough invisible \n Tadabito no \n\nto the eye of common people, \n me ni wa mienedo \n\nhow can one doubt \n Iwaki ne no \n\nthe spirit realm of gods \n kami no y\u016bfu wo \n\nof the Iwaki peaks? \n utagau beshi ya\n\n (from Iwaki san sanbyaku shu, quoted in Fujiwara 2021: 159)\n\n\nIn his seminal treatise, Enjoyment Visible and Invisible\nor Ken\u2019y\u016b rakuron, completed in 1867, Ariyo argues\nthat these deities should be revered, worshiped, and served not only\nduring one\u2019s lifetime, but even after death when people become\nspirits dwelling in the otherworld. Ariyo encourages people to live\nlife with a positive outlook and to embrace enjoyment both while on\nearth and also in the afterlife.\n\nAs Rosen and Ariyo continued their inquiry into spirits and the spirit\nrealm, the Meiji Restoration was proclaimed. As a result, their domain of\nHirosaki faced political turmoil and was forced to take a stance in\nthe Boshin War of 1868 to 1869. A fellow Hirata disciple and domainal\nsamurai fought and died for the emperor\u2019s army. Shinto priests of\ntheir circle conducted a funerary ritual to \u201ccall back\u201d and venerate\nthe spirits of these fallen soldiers. In the early years of the Meiji\nperiod, members of the Tsugaru Group variously celebrated the\nRestoration of Imperial rule, carried out religious reforms of the\nstate, continued kokugaku studies, and struggled with the\nrapid changes of a modern society. \n4.5 Kokugaku and the Meiji Restoration\nYano Gend\u014d or Harumichi (1823\u20131887)\n\nThe Meiji Restoration\u2019s reinstatement of imperial rule inspired\nmany of Atsutane\u2019s disciples who dreamed of a new\n\u201cdawn\u201d in the early years of the Meiji period. One such\nindividual was Yano Harumichi or Gend\u014d (1823\u20131887) who\nworked with like-minded Kokugaku scholars, Shinto priests, and\neducators in reviving ancient institutions and rites as an essential part of modern society. Harumichi was a retainer of \u014czu\ndomain. After moving to Edo, he studied at Sh\u014dheik\u014d academy\nand enrolled as a posthumous disciple of Hirata Atsutane. He served as\nan instructor to the Shirakawa family from 1863 and became the\nacademic head of the Yoshida Shinto school in 1867. During the\nRestoration and the revival of imperial rule, Harumichi worked with\nIwakura Tomomi, Tamamatsu Misao, and others in government planning and\nissuing memoranda. During the Meiji years he served in the Council of\nDivinity (Jingikan) to research genealogies at the Imperial\nHousehold Ministry.\n\nIn the twelfth month of 1867 (Keio 3), Harumichi issued his Humble\nPetition of a Fool (Kenkin sengo) just after the\nimperial court declared the \u201cRestoration of Imperial Rule\u201d\n(\u014csei fukko). This seminal treatise is a comprehensive Kokugaku prospectus on the politics of\nrestoring imperial politics, calling for a revival of ancient\ngovernment practices. Harumichi begins by declaring the Tokugawa regime\u2019s return of political authority to the imperial\ncourt to be the grandest event in over 600 years since the establishment\nof the first samurai government in the Kamakura shogunate of the late twelfth century. He then asserts three principles for imperial\ngovernance: the \u201crites\u201d (saishi) to worship gods\nand ancestors as did the ancient sage kings of China; the\n\u201cbenevolent government\u201d (jinsei) that cares for\nthe people like foremost \u201ctreasures\u201d as practiced from\nancient times according to the decree of the Imperial Ancestral Gods;\nand the \u201cauthority\u201d (ibu) to protect loyal\nsubjects and to quell those who dare to resist.\n\nHarumichi presents various proposals for the new Meiji government\nincluding the creation of a university or daigakk\u014d in\nthe palace in Kyoto. In terms of rites, he asserts the primary\nimportance of restoring the Daij\u014dsai, the inaugural Great New\nFood Festival ceremony to offer the first crops of rice to the\nancestral gods in the eleventh month following the new emperor\u2019s\nascension to the throne. For his textual authorities, Harumichi cites\nhis readings of the classical works of Japan beginning with The\nRecord of Ancient Matters (Kojiki), The Chronicles\nof Japan (Nihon shoki and Jingishiki), and\nKokugaku writings such as Motoori Norinaga\u2019s Commentaries on\nthe Record of Ancient Matters (Kojikiden) and Hirata\nAtsutane\u2019s Lectures on Ancient History\n(Koshiden). He also cites Chinese classics beginning with the\nAnalects, the Book of Filial Piety, and Six\nClassics, as well as writings of Western learning, astronomy, and\ngeography.\n\nAlthough Harumichi asserted lofty ideals for the Restoration at the\noutset, by the early years of Meiji, the state leaders increasingly\nadopted Western ideas and institutions. Furthermore, the efforts of\nradical members of the Hirata faction were suppressed and after a few\nyears the National University was closed. In disappointment, Harumichi\ncomposed the following poem:\n\n\nMy assumption\n Kashiwara no \n\nthat we were returning\n miyo ni kaeru to \n\nto the divine age of Kashiwara\n omoishi wa \n\nhas become nothing more than\n aranu yume nite \n\nthe impossible dream. \narikeru mono wo\n\n (quoted in Walthall 1998:\n301)\n\n\nHarumichi lamented that the dream of resurrecting the ideal ancient\nsociety of the seventh century shaped exclusively by Shinto and\nKokugaku doctrine would not be realized. Harumichi\u2019s sentiment\nwas shared by many others in the Hirata school.\n\n5. Meiji Period (1868\u20131912) Kokugaku\n\u014ckuni Takamasa (1792\u20131871) and Fukuba Bisei (1831\u20131907)\n\n\u014ckuni Takamasa (1792\u20131871) and Fukuba Bisei\n(1831\u20131907) were samurai of Tsuwano domain, and both studied at\nthe domanial school Y\u014dr\u014dkan. Takamasa learned Kokugaku from\nHirata Atsutane and Murata Harukado, and studied for a time at\nSh\u014dheik\u014d Academy in Edo. In 1853, U.S. Commodore Perry led a\nfleet of four \u201cBlack Ships\u201d to the bay of Edo, which led\nto the Tokugawa bakufu signing treaties which opened Japanese ports to\nWestern powers. Facing the challenges of domestic politics and\nencroaching Western powers, Takamasa noted that the Kokugaku of the\nMotoori school which focused on \u201cancient matters\u201d and\nliterary texts, and that of Atsutane which concerned itself with the\nspirit realm of \u201cyumei\u201d or\n\u201ckakuriyo\u201d were insufficient to respond to\nforeigners. Takamasa renamed his version of Kokugaku\n\u201chongaku\u201d or \u201cmototsu\nmanabi\u201d, the \u201cessential learning\u201d, based on\n\u201chonky\u014d\u201d or the \u201cessential\nteachings\u201d which he quoted from the Kojiki. In his\nHongaku kyoy\u014d, completed in 1855, Takamasa outlines the\ngoal of his \u201chongaku\u201d scholarship:\n\n\nHonky\u014d refers to the genealogy of our emperor and the ancient\nmatters (furukoto) of the divine age which convey the truth\nof when heaven and earth were formed. When viewing the ancient\nmatters, on the surface it appears shallow, but underneath lies a deep\nwill. People of the world perceive shallowness of their surface and\ndismiss, or insult and ridicule it, and believe it is inferior to\nConfucian and Buddhist writings. Something I, Takamasa, remember from\nmy youth, is that I lamented this. Wondering how I could draw out this\ndeep will, I sincerely prayed to the Great Goddess Amaterasu and the\nGod Omoikane, that I may discern that divine providence, to draw out\nthat hidden will. Thus I became one who teaches people broadly about\nthis. (1855 [1971: 404])\n\n\nTakamasa characterizes Japan as a nation whose emperor is enthroned by\nthe Heavenly Decree and whose state is governed by the shogun. The\nshogun encourages its people to uphold and preserve the virtues of\nduty, filial piety, and chastity, while the daimyo protect their\ndomains. The people work industriously in their various occupations.\nTakamasa asserts Japan\u2019s emperor is superior among the monarchs\nof the world because Japan\u2019s imperial lineage, unlike the\nothers, is uninterrupted from ancient times. He cites this as evidence\nfor the greatness and superiority of Japan among nations of the world.\nTo make the Japanese aware of such things including their need to\ncontinuously uphold the virtues of duty, filial piety, and chastity is\nthe focal point of his \u201cHongaku\u201d form of Kokugaku\nteachings. He goes as far as to say that such teachings should even be\ntaught to foreigners.\n\nWhile asserting the \u201crevere emperor, expel barbarians\u201d\nideology of late-Tokugawa, Takamasa acquiesced to the opening of the\ncountry as a necessary initial response, but proposed to eventually\nexpel foreigners over time. He wrote in Hongaku\nkyoy\u014d,\n\n\nNow foreign countries frequently send warships to seek commercial\nrelations. Although commercial relations are a good thing which are\nmutually beneficial, warships are weapons for conquering a nation.\nUtilizing these to start a war is to be a bandit. For the sake of the\nnation, it is necessary to expel and remove them. (1855 [1971:\n428])\n\n\nAfter studying at the domanial school, Fukuba Bisei later became a\ndisciple of Takamasa and Hirata Kanetane. From 1863 Bisei became\nactive politically in support of the imperial court against the\nTokugawa shogunate. In the late-Tokugawa years, Bisei took his orders\nfrom the daimyo Kamei Koremi, working in support of political reforms.\nIn 1867, Bisei directed the Separation of Kami and Buddhas\nmovement in Tsuwano, then worked with Takamasa to draft the Separation\nedicts issued across Japan in 1868. Those edicts forcibly removed\nBuddhist elements from shrines to re-establish them as exclusively\nShinto institutions. That same year, the Council of Divinity\n(Jingikan) was established as the highest office of\ngovernment, even above the Council of State (Daj\u014dkan),\nto carry out religious rituals of the imperial court and state. Bisei\nserved as a magistrate in this Council as well as a tutor to the\nimperial court. Working with Takamasa, Bisei formulated a Shinto theology which asserted that\nall shrines would be used to perform rites of the state.\n\nThe Hirata school had placed primacy on the kami\n\u014ckuninushi, lord of the underworld, and Ame-no-Minakanushi, one\nof the three creator deities. By contrast, that view was eclipsed by\nthe Shinto promoted by Takamasa and Bisei, who placed Amaterasu at the\ncenter of the pantheon, following the teachings of Motoori Norinaga\nand Aizawa Seishisai (1782\u20131863). Bisei worked as a high\nadministrator of Shinto affairs for the Meiji state and served as the\nmain administrator of the Great Promulgation Campaign (Taiky\u014d\nsenpu und\u014d). From 1870 through 1884, this campaign aimed to\ndevelop a popular awareness and understanding of \u201cShinto\u201d,\nand Bisei trained priests as national evangelists to proselytize a\nnational doctrine. As a part of these efforts to develop Shinto as a\nstate religion, Bisei contributed to the Unity of Religion and\nPolitics (saisei itchi, lit. Unity of Rites and Political\nRule) policy which presented the emperor as a sacred ruler who\nperformed rituals as part of governance. Rather than articulate his\nideas through writings, Bisei applied Kokugaku knowledge through\nrenewed rites and policies of the court and state.\n6. Kokugaku after Meiji\n\nLooking beyond the scope of the current entry, during the early\ndecades of the twentieth century one observes the fragmentation of\nKokugaku into numerous fields analogous to the broader sense of\nJapanese studies that informed Kada no Azumamaro\u2019s Kokugaku two\ncenturies earlier: folklore and ethnographic studies that built on the\npioneering work of Yanagida Kunio and Orikuchi Shinobu; rationales for\nthe kind of organic imperial theocracy such as was memorialized in the\n1890 Imperial Rescript on Education; the effort to historicize the\nessentialist concept of Kokutai or unique National Polity; and so\non.\n\nIn the immediate years following Japan\u2019s surrender in 1945,\nKokugaku was virtually a taboo topic in Japan\u2019s academic circles\noutside a handful of Shinto seminaries like Kokugakuin Daigaku in\nTokyo. Specialized studies of Japanese history, literature and\nreligions were of course permitted and even encouraged, but efforts to\nhistoricize Japanese essentialism were off-limits. Further,\nexpressions of Japanese racial or cultural superiority such as those\nthat had fueled the international excesses of the Asia-Pacific War\nyears were replaced in popular discourse by alternative claims of\nJapanese uniqueness: that Japanese people were naturally or\nintrinsically inclined toward harmonious behavior, and are\ncharacterized by diligence, frugality, honesty, and sensitivity to\nseasonal change; that these qualities explain Japan\u2019s success in\neconomic development and social stability, and that those traditional\nqualities are uniquely configured in contemporary Japanese society.\nThis began to change from the mid-1970s when scholarly studies of\nKokugaku\u2019s political and social thought\u2014the so-called\nnative ancient Way\u2014resumed in Japan, as did academic\nappointments for scholars with these specialties at Japan\u2019s\nleading universities. \n\nTheories of Japaneseness, collectively referred to as\n\nNihonjinron, have figured prominently in Japanese popular\nculture since the 1970s. Notions of Japan as an animistic\nspirit-infused realm in which humans can commune with animals and\nother objects and forces of nature are ubiquitous in Japan, coursing\nthrough popular manga and anime. These enjoy not\njust enormous popular appeal in Japan and worldwide, but also\ngovernment support as forms of \u201csoft power\u201d fundamental to\nthe representation of Japanese society outside Japan.\n",
