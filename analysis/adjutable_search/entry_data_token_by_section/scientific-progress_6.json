    "main_text": "Theories of Scientific Progress || Realism and Instrumentalism\n3.1 Realism and Instrumentalism\n\nA major controversy among philosophers of science is between\ninstrumentalist and realist views of scientific theories (Leplin 1984;\nPsillos 1999; Niiniluoto 1999a; Saatsi 2018). The\ninstrumentalists follow Duhem in thinking that theories are\nmerely conceptual tools for classifying, systematizing and predicting\nobservational statements, so that the genuine content of science is\nnot to be found on the level of theories (Duhem 1954). Scientific\nrealists, by contrast, regard theories as attempts to describe\nreality even beyond the realm of observable things and regularities,\nso that theories can be regarded as statements having a truth value.\nExcluding naive realists, most scientists are fallibilists in\nPeirce\u2019s sense: scientific theories are hypothetical and always\ncorrigible in principle. They may happen to be true, but we cannot\nknow this for certain in any particular case. But even when theories\nare false, they can be cognitively valuable if they are closer to the\ntruth than their rivals (Popper 1963). Theories should be testable by\nobservational evidence, and success in empirical tests gives inductive\nconfirmation (Hintikka 1968; Kuipers 2000) or non-inductive\ncorroboration to the theory (Popper 1959).\n\nIt might seem natural to expect that the main rival accounts of\nscientific progress would be based upon the positions of\ninstrumentalism and realism. But this is only partly true. To be sure,\nnaive realists as a rule hold the accumulation-of-truths view of\nprogress, and many philosophers combine the realist view of theories\nwith the axiological thesis that truth is an important goal of\nscientific inquiry. A non-cumulative version of the realist view of\nprogress can be formulated by using the notion of truthlikeness. But\nthere are also philosophers who accept the possibility of a realist\ntreatment of theories, but still deny that truth is a relevant value\nof science which could have a function in the characterization of\nscientific progress. Bas van Fraassen\u2019s (1980) constructive\nempiricism takes the desideratum of science to be empirical\nadequacy: what a theory says about the observable should be true.\nThe acceptance of a theory involves only the claim that it is\nempirically adequate, not its truth on the theoretical level. Van\nFraassen has not developed an account of scientific progress in terms\nof his constructive empiricism, but presumably such an account would\nbe close to empiricist notions of reduction and Laudan\u2019s account\nof problem-solving ability (see Section 3.2).\n\nAn instrumentalist who denies that theories have truth values usually\ndefines scientific progress by referring to other virtues theories may\nhave, such as their increasing empirical success. In 1906 Duhem\nexpressed this idea by a simile: scientific progress is like a\nmounting tide, where waves rise and withdraw, but under this\nto-and-fro motion there is a slow and constant progress. However, he\ngave a realist twist to his view by assuming that theories classify\nexperimental laws, and progress means that the proposed\nclassifications approach a \u201cnatural classification\u201d (Duhem\n1954).\n\nEvolutionary epistemology is open to instrumentalist (Toulmin 1972)\nand realist (Popper 1972) interpretations (Callebaut and Pinxten 1987;\nRadnitzky and Bartley 1987). A biological approach to human knowledge\nnaturally gives emphasis to the pragmatist view that theories function\nas instruments of survival. Darwinist evolution in biology is not\ngoal-directed with a fixed forward-looking goal; rather, species adapt\nthemselves to an ever changing environment. In applying this account\nto the problem of knowledge-seeking, the fitness of a theory can be\ntaken to mean that the theory is accepted by members of the\nscientific community. But a realist can reinterpret the evolutionary\nmodel by taking fitness to mean the truth or truthlikeness of\na theory (Niiniluoto 1984).\n",
