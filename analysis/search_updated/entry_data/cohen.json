    "preamble": "\n\nHermann Cohen (b. 1842, d. 1918), more than any other single figure,\nis responsible for founding the orthodox neo-Kantianism that dominated\nacademic philosophy in Germany from the 1870s until the end of the\nFirst World War. Earlier German philosophers finding inspiration in\nKant tended either towards speculative, metaphysical idealism, or\nsought to address philosophical questions with the resources of the\nempirical sciences, especially psychology. In contrast, Cohen\u2019s\nseminal interpretation of Kant offered a vision of philosophy that\ndecisively maintained its independence from empirical psychology,\nwithout at the same time simply lapsing back into uncritical\nmetaphysics. Cohen brought these attitudes to bear on a wide range of\ntopics, writing systematically about epistemology, philosophy of\nscience, ethics, law, political theory, and aesthetics. His\nanti-psychologism became a defining commitment not only of the Marburg\nSchool of neo-Kantianism, founded by Cohen himself, but of orthodox\nneo-Kantianism more generally. Indeed, that commitment ultimately\ndefined the philosophical context from which, in the early twentieth\ncentury, both phenomenology and logical positivism emerged.\n\nNo less significant than his influence on academic philosophy, Cohen\nwas his generation\u2019s preeminent German-Jewish public\nintellectual and religious philosopher. His philosophical ethics and\npolitical theory provided the foundation for a non-Marxist, Kantian\ndemocratic socialism that informed his more popular and topical\nwritings. He argued publicly for universal suffrage and for the rights\nof workers to organize democratically-constituted collectives. He also\nsaw deep points of connection between ethics and religion, and\ndeveloped a view of Judaism as a fundamentally ethical system of\nbelief and practice. He argued that monotheism was the historical\nsource of the idea of universal ethical laws, and thus that Judaism\noffered the world its first model of a universalist morality. This\nview of Judaism\u2019s ethical significance ultimately informed\nCohen\u2019s public defense of the Jews\u2019 place in Germany not\nonly against anti-Semitic attacks, but also against the arguments of\nearly twentieth-century Zionists. However, Cohen\u2019s influence on\nJewish thought extends far beyond debates within Imperial Germany: his\nlate religious writings inspired a broad renewal in twentieth-century\nJewish ethics and philosophy of religion.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\nBorn in 1842 in Coswig, Germany, Cohen was raised in a devout family.\nHis father was a synagogue cantor, and Cohen left Gymnasium\nin order to attend a rabbinical seminary in Breslau, Silesia (now\nWroc\u0142aw, Poland). But he decided against becoming a rabbi, and\nenrolled in university first in Breslau and then in Berlin, where he\nattended classes taught by a leading light in the history of\nphilosophy, the Aristotelian scholar and metaphysician Adolf\nTrendelenburg. He received his doctorate from the University of Halle,\nafter which, encouraged by Heymann Steinthal, he\nstudied V\u00f6lkerpsychologie, a philological and\nanthropological investigation of the origins of cultural products such\nas art and literature. It was in a journal of\nV\u00f6lkerpsychologie and linguistics that he published his\nfirst major work of Kant interpretation, an intervention in\nTrendelenburg\u2019s and Kuno Fischer\u2019s debate about\nKant\u2019s Transcendental Aesthetic (see \u00a72 below). That essay\nalso marked a decisive turn in Cohen\u2019s philosophical\norientation, and after two years in which he wrote on both\nKant\u2019s pre-critical philosophy and the Critique of Pure\nReason, he was appointed lecturer at the University of Marburg.\nThree years later, he was promoted to full Professor, a rank that was\nat that time in Germany almost never granted to unconverted Jews in\nphilosophy departments. It was no coincidence that Cohen\u2019s\nappointment and subsequent promotion took place during Bismark\u2019s\nanti-Catholic Kulturkampf, a brief period of relatively\nliberal attitudes toward Jews. But following Heinrich von\nTreitschke\u2019s notorious 1879 anti-Semitic attack on German-Jewish\nwriters and intellectuals, Cohen was compelled to enter the public\ndebate about the Jews\u2019 place in Imperial Germany. His\n\u201cDeclaration on the Jewish Question\u201d appeared in 1880, and\nquestions of German-Jewish identity would occupy him throughout his\ncareer (Schwarzschild 1979; Wiedebach 1997, Pts. 4\u20135; and Beiser\n2018). He remained at Marburg for almost four decades. After retiring\nfrom Marburg in 1912, Cohen returned to Berlin in order to teach at a\nrabbinical seminary, the Academy of Jewish Sciences. He spent four\nyears there, writing principally about religious problems, until his\ndeath in 1918.\n\nCohen\u2019s period of philosophical productivity spanned the\nduration of the German empire, from the late 1860s until 1918. We can\ndistinguish three periods in his writing (van der Linden 1988,\n205\u20136; Bonaunet 2004: 22ff). The first, early period is\ncharacterized by Cohen\u2019s attempts to develop his own views as\ncommentaries on Kant. During this period, he wrote Kant\u2019s\nTheory of Experience, Kant\u2019s Foundations of\nEthics, and Kant\u2019s Foundations of Aesthetics. The\nsecond period marks Cohen\u2019s mature philosophical work, which\ntook the form of his multi-volume System of Philosophy. In\nthe System, Cohen explicitly abandoned central Kantian\ndoctrines, and presented his views systematically, and as his own,\nrather than offering them as interpretations of Kant. The\nSystem included The Logic of Pure Knowledge, The\nEthics of Pure Will, and The Aesthetics of Pure Feeling.\n(He planned, but never wrote, a fourth part of the System on\nthe psychology of \u201ccultural consciousness.\u201d This fourth\npart was to provide the systematic foundation for the other three\nparts of the System [see Adelmann 1968 and Moynahan 2018].)\nFinally, although Cohen had been interested in religious questions\nthroughout his career, in the last years of his life they were his\noverwhelming concern. It was during this period that he wrote his\nReligion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism.\n\nHowever, while Cohen\u2019s interests and views evolved over the\ncourse of his career, his philosophy from all three periods\nnevertheless exhibits points of deep continuity. All of Cohen\u2019s\nmajor works share a profoundly historical orientation. A concern with\nthe history of philosophy dominates his writing, and he was convinced\nof history\u2019s continuing significance for philosophy in the\npresent. But he was also concerned with the histories of those\nsubjects he took to be philosophy\u2019s topics, including science,\nethics, and religion. This concern for history permeates his thought\nso completely that even in his systematic works, he prefers to\nintroduce concepts and theories not by defining them\nstraightforwardly, but by rehearsing major episodes in the history of\ntheir development. This historically-oriented method was a model for\nwhat later philosophers called Problemgeschichte \u2013 that\nis, the history of the origin, development, and evolution of\nphilosophical problems. In stands in contrast to historical surveys of\ncandidate solutions to problems the philosopher conceives as fixed,\nunchanging, and unresponsive to a broader philosophical context. (In\nCohen\u2019s hands, this historical orientation contributes in no\nsmall part to other aspects of his writing that none of his readers\ncan fail to notice: its obscurity, repetition, and sometimes\nunnecessary length.)\n\nTwo further commitments are continuous threads over the course of\nCohen\u2019s career and across multiple areas of his philosophical\nconcern: his idealism and (what Frederick Beiser [2018] calls) his\n\u201cmethodological rationalism.\u201d Cohen expresses his idealism\nin different ways over the course of his career. But we may\napproximate it as the view that a priori laws of human knowledge\ndetermine what counts an an object for us. For Cohen, this idealism is\nintended to capture Kant\u2019s insight that we can have a priori\nknowledge only of those features of objects that our own mind\ncontributes to them. But for Cohen, this is not an exclusively Kantian\ndoctrine. He develops it in part out of his early interpretation of\nPlato, according to which we strive to have things conform to our\nideas.\n\nCohen\u2019s methodological rationalism is his commitment to, as\nrecent commentators have put it, \u201cthe search for\nreasons\u201d (Beiser 2018, 3), the assumption of \u201cthe\nintelligibility of being\u201d (Renz 2018, 10), and the\n\u201cattempt to ground knowledge in critically reflexive,\nhypothetical, and self-consciously revisable concepts subject to\njustification\u201d (Nahme 2019, 8). Cohen\u2019s is not a\nrationalism that accepts any substantive doctrine, principle, or axiom\nas indubitable or necessarily true. Rather, it is the methodological\ncommitment never to accept any doctrine, principle, axiom, or any\nother representation as brute or unexplainable. Instead, for Cohen we\nmust always seek reasons for those representations. In Cohen\u2019s\nepistemology and philosophy of science, this commitment would\nculminate in his conception of \u201cpure thinking,\u201d that is,\nthinking that is free from the influence of anything external to it\n(see \u00a75 below). In his mature ethics and political philosophy, it\nis expressed in his view that ethics and the laws that unify a\ncommunity \u201cmust be seen as an appeal to justified\nreasoning...\u201d (Nahme 2019, 252) (see \u00a76 below). At the\nsame time Christian Damb\u00f6ck (2017, Ch. 4) argues that there is a\nsense in which Cohen is an \u201cempiricist,\u201d by which\nDamb\u00f6ck means that Cohen insists that philosophy must attend to\nthe facts of history and culture as it finds them. Ursula Renz (2018)\nargues that these two senses of \u201crationalism\u201d and\n\u201cempiricism\u201d need not conflict with one another. \n\nCohen himself came to think that one commitment above all else unified\nhis philosophy, from his earliest interpretation of Kant to his mature\nSystem of Philosophy. It was his commitment to a\nphilosophical method he claimed was Kant\u2019s, and that Cohen and\nhis students called the \u201ctranscendental method.\u201d What\nfollows is a sketch of that method in Cohen\u2019s philosophy: how it\nemerged from his interpretation of Kant; how he sought to apply that\nmethod in epistemology and philosophy of science, as well as in\nethics, political theory, and aesthetics; and finally, how he sought\nto articulate a view of religion as a necessary counterpart to\nphilosophy done according to that method.\n2. The Interpretation of Kant\n\nAs we have just seen, Cohen was committed to three ideas: first, an\nidealism according to which a priori laws of human knowledge determine\nwhat counts as an object for us; second, his methodological\nrationalism, and third, the \u201ctranscendental method\u201d (Edel\n1988). His early interpretation of Kant reveals these commitments in\nnascent form. It also reveals a problem that would occupy him\nthroughout his later writings on epistemology and philosophy of\nscience: the problem of explaining the origin of the a priori laws in\nhuman knowledge.\n\nIn 1871 Cohen published a long essay, \u201cOn the Controversy\nbetween Trendelenburg and Kuno Fischer,\u201d and a book, the first\nedition of Kant\u2019s Theory of Experience. They were both\ndefenses of Kant against objections that Cohen thought badly\nmisunderstood his views on objectivity and the a priori. Cohen was\nresponding to an interpretation of Kant in the 1860s commonly held by\nfigures of the Back-to-Kant movement such as Hermann von Helmholtz and\nCohen\u2019s own senior colleague at Marburg, F.A. Lange, as well as\nby non-Kantian philosophers such as Adolf Trendelenburg. Very roughly,\nthese figures thought that Kant held (or that Kantian philosophers\nought to hold) that the character of human knowledge is determined by\nboth objective and subjective factors. On one hand, there are objects\nthat exist independently of the subject\u2019s mind. These objects\naffect the subject\u2019s mind, and in so doing contribute the\nobjective element to the subject\u2019s representations. On the other\nhand, there are structures in the subject\u2019s mind\u2014say, the\nforms of human intuition, space and time. Because these structures are\nin the subject\u2019s mind and thus don\u2019t come from experience,\nthey are a priori. Further, these a priori structures organize the\nsubject\u2019s representations and thereby contribute a subjective,\nmind-dependent element to them. But since on this interpretation of\nKant the a priori is subjective, an explanation of knowledge\u2019s\nobjectivity must appeal not to it, but to the objects that exist\nindependently of the mind.\n\nCohen thought this interpretation of Kant was wrong, and he thought\nthat influential objections to Kant depended on it. Cohen was\nespecially concerned with Trendelenburg\u2019s well-known\n\u201cneglected alternative\u201d objection to Kant\u2019s claim\nthat space and time are nothing but the forms of intuition. But Cohen\nwas also concerned with J.F. Herbart\u2019s (and in Cohen\u2019s own\ntime, Helmholtz\u2019s) contention that Kant thought spatial\nrepresentations were innate. Since Cohen thought both\nTrendelenburg\u2019s and Herbart\u2019s objections depended on a\nmisinterpretation of Kant, he thought those objections failed. He\nresponded to them by defending an alternative account of the relation\nbetween objectivity and the Kantian a priori (K\u00f6hnke 1991,\n175\u20138; Patton 2005). (See Biagioli 2014 and Biagioli 2018 for a\nbroadly sympathetic account of Cohen\u2019s response to Helmholtz in\nparticular; Hyder 2013 offers a defense of Helmholtz on geometry\nagainst Cohen\u2019s criticisms of him.)\n\nThus Kant\u2019s Theory of Experience is above all an\nattempt to articulate and defend Cohen\u2019s alternative\ninterpretation of Kant\u2019s a priori. On that interpretation,\nKant\u2019s aim in the Critique of Pure Reason is to show\nhow a priori laws of human thought explain the character of our\nexperience of objects. For Cohen, because these a priori laws are\nnecessary, they are objective. So Kant\u2019s explanation of\nobjective experience appeals to them, and not to the effects of any\nalleged mind-independent objects.\n\nCohen argues that there are three different \u201clevels\u201d or\n\u201cdegrees\u201d of Kant\u2019s a priori. He claims that the\nfirst of these is inessential for Kant\u2019s philosophy, and\nconsists in the apparently permanent \u201cmetaphysical\u201d\nstructures we can discover in our own thought by means of\nintrospection. The second level of the a priori consists in the forms\nof sensibility and the understanding, that is, space, time, and the\ncategories. But the necessity of these forms ultimately derives from\nthe necessity of the third level of the a priori, because the forms of\nsensibility and understanding are \u201cscientific\nabstractions\u201d (Cohen 1987 [1871b], 83\u201384) from that third\nlevel. The third level is thus the most important of the three levels.\nCohen argues that a priori laws in this most important, third sense\nconsist in the \u201cformal conditions of the possibility of\nexperience.\u201d Or, as he also sometimes puts it, the a priori in\nthis third sense consists in laws that are \u201cconstitutive\nof\u201d of the possibility of experience. For Cohen, these\nnecessary, a priori laws define what an object of experience\nis for us. (Klaus Christian K\u00f6hnke identifies this point\nin Cohen as the source of the central Marburg School doctrine that a\npriori laws \u201cgenerate\u201d objects of possible experience\n[K\u00f6hnke 1991, 178\u201384].)\n\nCohen has a striking view of what a priori laws of the third level\nactually consist in, and of the possible experience they are\nconstitutive of. Although he would emphasize this striking view more\nin later writings it is nevertheless explicit in the first edition of\nhis Kant\u2019s Theory of Experience. He did not think the\nthird level of the a priori consists in cognitive structures in the\nsubject\u2019s mind, structures we could discover by doing physiology\n(as, for example Helmholtz and Lange thought) or by introspection (as,\nfor example, J.F. Fries and, in Cohen\u2019s own time, J\u00fcrgen\nBona Meyer thought) (de Schmidt 1976: Ch. 2.3). Rather, he insisted\nthat these a priori laws were the principles of mathematics and the\nfundamental laws of pure natural science, that is, mechanics. Further,\nthese principles and laws are constitutive of the possibility of\nexperience in a very specific and, Cohen insists, Kantian sense of\n\u201cexperience\u201d: for Cohen, experience consists in the\ntheories furnished by the mathematically precise science of nature,\nconsidered as if laid out \u201cin printed books\u201d (Cohen 1877,\n27). That is, on Cohen\u2019s interpretation, Kant\u2019s a priori\nis not principally concerned with the cognitive activity of the\nknower. Rather, it consists in the laws of mathematically precise\nnatural science considered independently of \u2013 as if\nfree-floating from \u2013 the mind of any particular knower. (At the\nsame time, Charlotte Baumann (2019) argues that, in at least some of\nhis writings, Cohen does retain some concern with the role of\nsensation in experience.)\n\nCohen\u2019s interpretation of Kant is thus robustly\nanti-psychologistic: he thinks any consideration of how the human mind\noperates to produce representations is completely irrelevant to a\nphilosophical account of knowledge\u2019s objective validity. In\nfact, some commentators have argued that Cohen offers the first\ngenuinely anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant\u2019s\nCritique of Pure Reason (Hatfield 1990, 110; Anderson 2005,\n298; and Beiser 2015, 466). On a standard account, Cohen\u2019s\nanti-psychologism was motivated, most fundamentally, by a desire to\nensure that the objective validity of knowledge was not, on his\naccount, undermined by the subjectivity of sensation (see especially\nEdel 2010: 60ff). More recently, Beiser has argued that Cohen\u2019s\nanti-psychologism was a response to the materialism controversy and\nCohen\u2019s religious antipathy to any attempt to naturalize the\nhuman subject (Beiser 2014, 466). Alternatively, Paul Nahme has\nsuggested that Cohen\u2019s anti-psychologism might even have been a\nresponse to the physiological orientation of so-called scientific\nracists and anti-Semites (Nahme 2019, 163). \n\nDespite the robustness of Cohen\u2019s anti-psychologism, it is not\nalways easy to locate in his writings. On almost every page of\nKant\u2019s Theory of Experience (and later, The Logic\nof Pure Knowledge) Cohen helps himself to the language of\ntranscendental idealism and transcendental psychology, giving the\nimpression of an active, conscious mind, with faculties of sensibility\nand understanding that produce the subject\u2019s experience of\nobjects. But, Cohen insists, this language is actually\nanti-psychologistic: understood properly, the Kantian\u2019s talk of\ncognitive faculties really refers to the methods of mathematically\nprecise natural science. Thus the \u201cfaculty\u201d of sensibility\nis really just the methods by which the mathematician constructs\nspatial magnitudes, and the \u201cfaculty\u201d of understanding is\nreally just the most basic set of concepts the physicist uses to\nrepresent physical objects (Cohen 1885, 586ff.) Kantian theory of\nknowledge thus turns out to be the philosophical investigation of the\nmethods natural science uses to represent objects.\n3. The Transcendental Method\n\nSo Cohen takes the theories of mathematical natural science to be (or\nto be paradigms of) \u201cexperience.\u201d And he takes the\nfundamental concepts and laws of those theories to be the a priori\nlaws that constitute experience\u2019s possibility. Why?\n\nFor Cohen, these distinctive views are consequences of his\ninterpretation of Kant\u2019s philosophical method. Cohen and his\nstudents, Paul Natorp and Ernst Cassirer, would take this\nphilosophical method to be the defining characteristic of\nCohen\u2019s Kantianism, rather than any of Kant\u2019s particular\narguments or doctrines (Cassirer 2005 [1912], 115; Natorp 1912,\n194\u20135). As Cohen himself puts it, \u201c[p]hilosophy is not\n\u2018doctrine\u2019, but critique\u201d (Cohen 1885, 577), and it\nis above all the Kantian philosophical method that distinguishes\nCohen\u2019s philosophy from pre-critical philosophy.\n\nWe can see Cohen\u2019s view of philosophical method in its nascent\nform emerge from his interpretation of Kant\u2019s Analytic of\nPrinciples and the Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics.\nHowever, Cohen would articulate the method clearly only much later, in\nhis mature writing. Only later would Cohen (and his students) call it\nthe \u201ctranscendental method.\u201d (See Luft 2015, Ch. 1.5 for a\nthorough discussion of the transcendental method.)\n\nAccording to Cohen, for Kant mathematical natural science is the\nstarting-point of philosophical investigation. It is the explanandum\nthat Kantian philosophy seeks to explain. It is then up to philosophy\nto identify and articulate the a priori laws in that experience that\nare responsible for making it objective. If it is less than obvious\nthat this is Kant\u2019s method in the Critique of Pure\nReason, Cohen insists, it is at least clear in the\nProlegomena. There, Kant is explicit that he begins by\nassuming that mathematical natural science provides us with genuine\nobjective knowledge, and that it contains synthetic a priori\nprinciples; Kant is likewise explicit that his task is to identify the\nnecessary conditions of those principles\u2019 possibility, and that\ndoing so will explain the objectivity of mathematical natural science.\n(Kant is also explicit that this method, which in the\nProlegomena he calls the \u2018analytic method,\u2019 is\nnot the method he uses in the Critique of Pure Reason, nor\nwould it be suitable for the full project of the Critique.\nCohen seems cheerfully undaunted by this textual anomaly.) (See Rendl\n2018 for discussion of Cohen\u2019s motivations for taking the\nanalytic method of the Prolegomena as his guide.) \n\nTaking Kant\u2019s method in the Prolegomena as his guide,\nCohen claims that the method of Kantian philosophy is this. He thinks\nphilosophy takes the theories of mathematical natural science as its\nstarting point. It begins, as he puts it, with the \u201cfact of\nmathematical natural science\u201d (Cohen 1883, 119\u2013120).\nAlthough Cohen does not emphasize it in the first edition of\nKant\u2019s Theory of Experience, he thinks (and it is\nconsistent with his views) that this \u201cfact of science\u201d\nchanges as science progresses. On the transcendental method, the\nphilosopher takes the best physical theories of the day as her\nstarting point, and thus the \u201cfact of science\u201d will be\ndifferent for philosophers in different periods of the history of\nscience.\n\nFurther, Cohen identifies the a priori of his third level, the laws of\nmathematical natural science, with the synthetic a priori principles\nKant thinks mathematical natural science contains. Cohen says of these\nsynthetic a priori principles that they are \u201cthat which is\npresent\u201d in experience (Cohen 1987 [1871b], 206). So philosophy\nseeks to explain the possibility of experience by identifying and\narticulating the a priori laws \u201cpresent\u201d in it. As Cohen\nwould later put it, experience, conceived as the evolving doctrines of\nmathematical natural science, is \u201cgiven as a task\u201d\n[aufgegeben] to philosophy: while experience is given with\nsynthetic a priori principles already contained in it, it is the task\nof philosophy to identify and articulate those principles, and in so\ndoing to explain how they make objective experience possible.\n\nIt can be difficult to see how this method allows for any\nphilosophically critical evaluation of theories in the history of\nscience \u2013 a kind of evaluation Cohen never shies away from. On\nthe transcendental method, philosophy does not seek philosophical\ngrounds for casting doubt on or rejecting mathematical or scientific\ntheories. Rather, it starts by taking those theories and their\nobjectivity for granted. It starts with them as facts, as\nexplananda in need of philosophical explanation. But Cohen often\ncriticizes and rejects theories he does not like, and does so for\napparently philosophical reasons. This is especially clear in the\nhistorical sections of his 1883 Principle of the Infinitesimal\nMethod and its History, where Cohen uses apparently philosophical\nprinciples to criticize and reject various efforts in the history of\nmathematics to define, for example, limits and infinitesimals. But\nCohen\u2019s criticisms do not violate the transcendental method. The\nprinciples that serve as the basis for his criticisms emerge from a\nphilosophical investigation of theories given in the history of\nscience. They are thus principles that turn out to be required for the\nphilosophical explanation of those theories and their objectivity.\n\nCohen\u2019s colleague at Marburg, Natorp, would emphasize a major\nadvantage of the transcendental method for Cohen (Natorp 1912,\n196\u20137). This method allows Cohen to avoid what he and his\nstudents took to be the two major errors of other post-Kantian\nphilosophy. First, because Cohen sought to explain the possibility of\nexperience by appeal to a priori laws in it, he avoided the\nphysiologically-oriented psychologism of Helmholtz and Lange, among\nothers. But second, the transcendental method anchors Kantian\nphilosophy to mathematical natural science as its starting point. This\nanchor prevents philosophy from taking off on the speculative,\nmetaphysical flights of fancy that, in the minds of many Kantian\nphilosophers in the 1860s and 1870s, decisively undermined the\nIdealist Naturphilosophie of the first half of the nineteenth\ncentury. For Cohen and his students, the transcendental method thus\nmakes possible a philosophy that is properly scientific, without\nabsorbing it completely into physiology and psychology.\n4. A Period of Transition\n\nCohen\u2019s 1883 The Principle of the Infinitesimal Method and\nits History and the second, 1885 edition of Kant\u2019s\nTheory of Experience reveal the considerable extent to which he\nmodified and deepened his epistemology and philosophy of science over\nthe course of the 1870s and early 1880s. In one move that marks his\nincreasing clarity about his own views, he abandons the term\n\u201ctheory of knowledge\u201d [Erkenntnistheorie] as\nirredeemably psychologistic, since it was too closely associated with\npsychologically-oriented projects such as Helmholtz\u2019s. Instead,\nhe proposes to call the project of his theoretical philosophy\n\u201ccritique of knowledge\u201d [Erkenntniskritik].\n\nBeyond merely terminological changes, in The Principle of the\nInfinitesimal Method and the second edition of Kant\u2019s\nTheory of Experience, Cohen offers a better developed and more\nclearly articulated account of the substance of his epistemological\nview. He calls the view \u201ccritical idealism.\u201d The view is a\nform of idealism, because Cohen still maintains that a priori laws\ncontained within scientific theories make it possible for those\ntheories to represent objects. But the idealism is\n\u201ccritical\u201d because it is Kantian \u2013 that is, for\nCohen, because it is committed above all to the transcendental method\n(Cohen 1883, 6ff).\n\nCohen\u2019s increased clarity about critical idealism emerged in\npart from work on the history of philosophy he did in the 1870s and\nearly 1880s. He presents his view of that history in both The\nPrinciple of the Infinitesimal Method and a long introduction he\nadded to the second edition of Kant\u2019s Theory of\nExperience. As Cohen sees it, Plato and Leibniz play roles in the\ndevelopment of critical idealism that are second only to Kant\u2019s.\nLike Kant, both sought to understand mathematics as paradigms of\nknowledge in general. Further, as Cohen argued in his 1878 essay\n\u201cPlato\u2019s Doctrine of Ideas and Mathematics,\u201d Plato\nanticipated Kant in maintaining that the objects of our thought are\nexplained by appeal to \u201cideas\u201d (which Cohen, employing his\ncharacteristic form of philosophical charity, identified with Kantian\na priori laws) (Edel 1988, Ch. 4). In contrast with this\nPlatonic-rationalist antecedent to critical idealism, Cohen argues,\nstands an Aristotelian-empiricist tradition. Members of this\nuncritical tradition believe, in one way or another, that we must\nexplain the objects of our thought by appeal to objects that exist\nindependently of the mind.\n\nAt the same time, Cohen\u2019s willingness to reject certain Kantian\ndoctrines reveals the extent to which his critical idealism was a\ncommitment only to what he took to be Kant\u2019s philosophical\nmethod. For example, in one of the many sections he added to the\nsecond edition of Kant\u2019s Theory of Experience, Cohen\nargues that the proper way to understand the notion of the\nthing-in-itself is not (as Kant seems to suggest) as an object that\nexists independently of the subject\u2019s representations, somehow\naffecting the subject and thereby giving rise to her sensations.\nRather, Cohen argues that we must think of the thing-in-itself as the\ntotality of all experience, taken as an object of thought (Cohen 1885,\n503ff). Since it is the totality of all experience, rather than merely\nthe experience we happen to have at our particular point in the\nhistory of science, the thing-in-itself is the ideal that science and\ncritical philosophy aim at (see Stang 2018).\n\nThe Principle of the Infinitesimal Method is perhaps most\nsignificant for how it presents a detailed illustration of what the\ncritique of knowledge done according to the transcendental method\nlooks like. The book is a philosophically critical history of the\ndevelopment of calculus. In it, Cohen aims to establish the validity\nof calculus\u2019 foundational concepts \u2013 concepts such as\nlimit and infinitesimal \u2013 in the face of\nphilosophical objections against them. He also aims to establish a\nconnection between the concept of infinitesimals and natural\nscience\u2019s capacity to represent reality. In fact, these two aims\nare connected. For Cohen, the concept of an infinitesimal magnitude is\nvalid for use in calculus, because it is a necessary condition of the\npossibility of natural science\u2019s representation of real objects.\n(See Edel 2010, Richardson 2006, Giovanelli 2011, Giovanelli 2016, and\nEdgar forthcoming).\n\nCohen sees this connection between infinitesimals and reality in the\nsection of the Critique of Pure Reason that Kant called the\nAnticipations of Perception. In the Anticipations, Kant introduces the\nidea of magnitudes that can vary continuously from a finite magnitude\nto zero. He calls these continuously variable magnitudes intensive\nmagnitudes. Kant argues that there is an important connection\nbetween continuously variable magnitudes, sensation, and reality.\nWhile Cohen thinks Kant\u2019s concern with sensation is a mistake,\nhe thinks the connection between continuously variable magnitudes\n\u2013 that is, infinitesimals \u2013 and reality is exactly right.\nThe connection is this. For Cohen, mathematical natural science can\nrepresent real objects only if it represents them as having unique\nidentity conditions. Those identity conditions are defined by unique\nlocations in space and time. But, Cohen insists, the mathematical\nunits that natural science uses to represent space and time must\nthemselves be defined by appeal to infinitesimal magnitudes.\n\nThat final claim \u2013 that the mathematical units of space and time\nmust be defined by appeal to infinitesimals \u2013 follows for Cohen\nfrom the principle of continuity. This is the Leibnizian principle\nthat Cohen glosses as \u201cthere are no jumps in\nconsciousness\u201d (Cohen 1883, \u00a742), which for him means that\nmathematical and scientific theories must represent objects as\ncontinuous. Recent commentators have emphasized that, for Cohen, the\nprinciple of continuity is a requirement of reason, and thus an\nexpression of his methodological rationalism (see Damb\u00f6ck 2017,\n4.4.1 and Edgar forthcoming). At the same time, that the principle of\ncontinuity serves this function for mathematical natural science is,\nfor Cohen, a fact of science revealed by his historical investigation\nof the development of calculus.\n5. Pure Thinking, Generation, and Origin\n\nHowever, Cohen would not remain satisfied with his account of\ncalculus\u2019 foundational concepts and their significance for a\nphilosophical theory of knowledge. His final major work in\nepistemology was the 1902 Logic of Pure Knowledge, the first\npart of his projected System of Philosophy. In that book,\nCohen claims that there is an important connection between the\nconcepts of infinitesimals and infinities, and something he now calls\n\u201cpure thinking.\u201d For Cohen, thinking is pure just\nin case it is independent of any and all influences that are external\nto thought or reason. Nothing is given to pure thinking\n\u2013 not the data of sensible intuition, not the activity of a\nFichtean I, not the Absolute. Cohen claims that the infinitesimal\ncalculus is the paradigmatic example of \u201cthe triumph of pure\nthinking\u201d (Cohen 1902, 35). But more than that, he thinks an\nanalysis of the infinite is precisely what first raises the\nphilosophical question of pure thinking \u2013 that is, the question\nof how pure thinking functions to let mathematical natural science\nrepresent objects (Cohen 1902, 35).\n\nThe concept of pure thinking, and the closely related concepts of\ngeneration and origin, are central to Cohen\u2019s\nproject in the Logic. All three concepts have to do with the\nprinciples that, on Cohen\u2019s view, define what an object is for\nmathematical natural scientific theories. In Kant\u2019s Theory\nof Experience, Cohen had been content to identify and exhibit\nsynthetic a priori principles as \u201cpresent\u201d in experience.\nBut now in the Logic, he is concerned with the question of\nthose principles\u2019 foundation \u2013 that is, with their\n\u201corigin.\u201d Cohen now argues that pure thinking\ngenerates those principles from itself. Or in his preferred\nidiom, pure thinking is \u201cgeneration.\u201d\n\nOn its face, the concept of pure thinking is obscure. Likewise for\nCohen\u2019s claim that pure thinking generates out of itself the\nprinciples that explain mathematical natural science\u2019s objective\nvalidity. However, we can start to understand these ideas by recalling\ntwo of the commitments that underpin all of Cohen\u2019s theoretical\nphilosophy: first, his idealism, that is, his insistence that a priori\nlaws of human knowledge determine what counts as an object for us; and\nsecond, his methodological rationalism, that is, his commitment to an\nunending search for reasons and his unwillingness to accept anything\nas given or brute.\n\nFor Cohen in the Logic, the principles that constitute the\nobject of mathematical natural scientific knowledge must be generated\nby pure thinking, since only then can we have a priori knowledge of\nthat object (Beiser 2018, 196\u20137). But Cohen\u2019s\nmethodological rationalism gives us another way to understand why\nthose principles must be generated by pure thinking. To say that pure\nthinking is independent of any influences external to thought or\nreason is to say that pure thinking makes a rational demand: it can\naccept no representations that are given, brute, or unexplained. When\nCohen asserts that pure thinking generates the principles\nthat constitute the object of mathematical natural science, he means\nthat no part of that object has its source outside of pure thinking\nand thus no part of it can be left as given or unexplained. For Cohen,\nthen, pure thinking is not so much a species of cognitive content so\nmuch as it is a methodological demand. (See Beiser 2018, [Ch. 11] for\na detailed account of pure thinking as regulative.)\n\nOne striking consequence of Cohen\u2019s conception of pure thinking\nis something he is at pains to emphasize, namely, a decisive break\nwith Kant on a point central to Kant\u2019s system. In the\nLogic, Cohen rejects Kant\u2019s view that (in human\nknowledge) there is a faculty of sensible intuition that is\nindependent of the faculty of understanding. In effect, Cohen now\ndecisively rejects Kant\u2019s claim that sensible intuition is the\ncapacity that immediately relates objects to the knower (Kant\n1781/1787 [1998], A19/B33). From Cohen\u2019s perspective, that view\nis now unacceptable, because it posits a faculty of sensibility that\nis forever external to pure thinking, and thus forever given or\nunexplained. Further, since on Cohen\u2019s view a philosophical\naccount of knowledge does not appeal to an independent faculty of\nsensible intuition, Cohen insists that the project he had previously\ncalled the \u201ccritique of knowledge\u201d now becomes the\n\u201clogic of pure knowledge.\u201d (Cohen\u2019s view in the\nLogic appears somewhat similar to so-called\n\u201cconceptualist\u201d interpretations of Kant in the\ncontemporary Kant literature. [For example, Longuenesse 1998, Ch. 8\nand Friedman 2012.] So how radically one thinks Cohen\u2019s\nLogic breaks with Kant will depend on one\u2019s views of\nthe conceptualist interpretation of Kant. I leave it as an open\nquestion how much Cohen\u2019s views in the Logic differ\nfrom the conceptualist interpretation of Kant.)\n\nNotwithstanding that decisive break with Kant, other parts of the\nLogic still reflect Cohen\u2019s Kantianism. For Cohen, pure\nthinking generates the pure principles of knowledge through judgment\n\u2013 the epistemic structure that, he thinks (following Kant),\nrelates different concepts to one another. Consequently, in the\nLogic Cohen aims above all to articulate the twelve different\ntypes of foundational judgments that, he thinks, make it possible for\nmathematical natural scientific theories to represent objects. To be\nsure, Cohen\u2019s twelve types of judgment partly reflect the\nsection of the first Critique that Kant called the table of\nthe functions of judgment. At the same time, even here Cohen does not\nmerely reproduce Kant\u2019s doctrine. Perhaps most significantly,\nCohen abandons Kant\u2019s account of the three possible\n\u201cqualities\u201d of judgment and replaces it with his own\naccount of the judgments of origin, identity, and contradiction. For\nCohen, these judgments express the most foundational moments in the\norigin of pure thinking. Moreover, he develops his accounts of them at\nleast partly from reflection on the concepts of the infinite,\ninfinitesimals, and continuity. This should hardly be surprising,\ngiven his claim that pure thinking\u2019s function in knowledge is\nfirst revealed by an analysis of the infinite.\n\nCohen never gave up the view that the concepts of the infinite,\ninfinitesimals, and continuity were central to a philosophical account\nof pure thinking and knowledge. Yet his account of those mathematical\nconcepts was never convincing to mathematicians and philosophers of\nmathematics in the analytic tradition. Gottlob Frege complained that\nCohen\u2019s views in the Principle of the Infinitesimal\nMethod were too unclear to be intelligible (Frege 1885 [1984]).\nBertrand Russell objected that Cohen failed to understand that\nmathematicians now had a formal treatment of continuity and limits\nthat freed them of any commitment to infinitesimals (Russell 1903, Ch.\n41). Even Cassirer, Cohen\u2019s own student, abandoned Cohen\u2019s\naccount of infinitesimals, likely in response to Russell\u2019s\nobjections. Consequently, Cassirer also abandoned many of the details\nof Cohen\u2019s theory of knowledge in the Logic. (See\nGiovanelli 2016 for an account of how even Cohen\u2019s allies were\nunpersuaded by Cohen\u2019s account of the infinitesimal concept and\nits centrality to his account of knowledge. Edgar forthcoming argues\nthat Russell in particular failed to understand the philosophical\nsignificance of Cohen\u2019s account of the infinitesimal concept and\nits place in his theory of knowledge.)\n6. Ethics, Jurisprudence, and the Laws of Human Action\n\nCohen did not restrict his use of the transcendental method to\nepistemology and philosophy of science. As Sebastian Luft argues,\n\u201cthe exact sciences are his point of departure, but they are not\nthe only object of critique\u201d (Luft 2015, 58). For Cohen, the\ntranscendental method must be applied to ethics as well. He thus\nsought to extend its application beyond a treatment of the laws of\nnature to the laws of human action. He ultimately argued that the\nresult of this application was a Kantian ethical justification for\ndemocratic socialism.\n\nCohen\u2019s first attempt to apply the transcendental method to\nethics was his Kant\u2019s Foundations of Ethics, which\nfirst appeared in 1877. In it, he is motivated by a dissatisfaction\nthat Kant could not provide a transcendental deduction of the moral\nlaw the way he had for the categories in the first Critique\n(Cohen 1877, 179). In the first Critique, Kant had argued\nthat the categories are justified, because they are necessary\nconditions for the possibility of experience. But in the Critique\nof Practical Reason, he argued that the moral law cannot be\njustified as a necessary condition of experience, because we can\nexperience ourselves only as beings whose actions have natural causes,\nand cannot experience ourselves as free moral agents. Thus, Kant\ninsisted, the moral law must be the sole \u201cfact of\nreason\u201d\u2014a fact that has no, but needs no, justification\nbeyond the force with which it impresses itself on us (Kant 1999\n[1788], 5:31, 5:47\u20138). Cohen thinks this was an inadequate\njustification of the moral law. He attempts to show that an improved\njustification results from transcendental reflection on the idea of a\npure will, that is, the idea of a will that is not conditioned by any\nantecedent causes and is therefore free. With Kant, he argues that\nsuch a will is possible only on the condition that the moral law\napplies to it. But unlike Kant, he does not assert the actuality of a\npure, free will. Rather, he argues that freedom of the will is itself\na regulative ideal, an end at which we aim our actions (Cohen 1877,\n199\u2013201ff.).\n\nHowever, Cohen did not remain satisfied with this account of the\nfoundations of the moral law, nor with his early view of how the\ntranscendental method applies in the domain of ethics. In his 1904\nEthics of Pure Will, the second part of his System of\nPhilosophy, he offers a significantly revised account of both.\nHere, Cohen\u2019s account is shaped by two commitments. First, he\nasserts that the subject matter of ethics is humanity, that is, human\nmoral agency (Cohen 1902, 3). He thinks the aim of ethics is to\nconstruct a normative theory of the human moral agent and its will.\nSecond, unlike in his earlier Kant\u2019s Foundations of\nEthics, Cohen now takes seriously the requirement that the\ntranscendental method begins with a fact of science. For Cohen, just\nas epistemology and philosophy of science must begin by accepting the\ntheories of pure natural science as given, ethics according to the\ntranscendental method must begin with a science of humanity.\n\nCohen canvasses three possibilities for such a science of humanity.\nEthics might start with a Fichtean \u201cscience\u201d of the\nsubject. But Cohen rejects this possibility as a lapse back into\npre-critical speculation (Cohen 1902, 13ff.). Alternatively, ethics\nmight start with naturalistic human sciences such as psychology. But,\nCohen objects, making these sciences the starting point for ethical\nreflection would violate Kant\u2019s insistence that ethics\ndistinguishes between normative and non-normative considerations,\nbetween what Cohen calls Being and the Ought (Cohen 1902, 9ff.).\n\nThus Cohen argues that ethics begins with the science of\njurisprudence, that is, the science that investigates law and human\nbeings considered precisely as agents whose actions are bound by\nlaw\u2019s normative constraints (Cohen 1902, 66ff.). Cohen does not\nhave in mind a jurisprudence that is concerned only with positive law.\nRather, the transcendental method in ethics begins with pure\njurisprudence, which investigates the very concept of law and its\nessential features such as universality. Pure jurisprudence is thus\nthe science of universal laws of human action. (Pure jurisprudence in\nthis sense was one topic of German legal theory around the turn of the\ntwentieth century. Rudolf Stammler\u2019s 1902 The Theory of\nJustice is representative.) For Cohen, this evolving body of pure\nlegal doctrine constitutes a fact of science. Ethics according to the\ntranscendental method accepts it as given. Then, by reflecting on this\nevolving body of legal doctrine, ethics seeks to construct a theory of\nthe human being as a moral agent (Schwarzschild 1975).\n\nPure jurisprudence guides ethics in constructing a theory of humanity\nby overcoming a problem that, Cohen thinks, any theory of humanity\nfaces. He claims the concept of humanity has a tension contained in\nit: a human being is at once an individual and a member of various\npluralities, such as religious communities or economic collectives\n(Cohen 1902, 3ff). Further, the wills of pluralities of individuals do\nnot necessarily cohere: individuals do not necessarily will things\nthat are consistent with what other individuals will, or with what the\ncommunity as a whole wills. But, Cohen suggests, without an account of\nwhat an individual may will consistently with the wills of others, we\nhave no coherent account of the moral agent as both an individual and\na member of a plurality. Thus any theory of humanity requires an\naccount of how to reconcile individuals\u2019 wills within a\nplurality. As Cohen puts it, individuals\u2019 wills must be unified\ninto a totality. Or, in somewhat less opaque language, we must\nunderstand how the universal laws of an ideal state can reconcile the\nwills of individuals and pluralities (Wiedebach 1997, Pt. 3). Further,\naccording to Cohen, if we want to think systematically about what\nthose universal laws are, we must start by reflecting on the evolving\nbody of legal doctrine provided by pure jurisprudence\u2014the\nscience of universal laws. For Cohen, the doctrines of pure\njurisprudence to do evolve arbitrarily: they evolve in an unending\nprocess of demanding and giving reasons. Paul Nahme thus claims that\n\u201c[w]e can therefore describe Cohen\u2019s account of the\nethical will as a logic of public reasoning...\u201d(Nahme 2019,\n268).\n\nCohen\u2019s emphasis on the universal character of ethical laws is\nclearly Kantian in spirit, and he certainly intends the universal laws\nof an ideal state to be the laws people must give to themselves in\nKant\u2019s realm of ends. But still, it is not obvious how exactly\nto characterize the relation of Cohen\u2019s ethics to Kant\u2019s.\nOn one plausible reading of Kant, a general theory of the moral will\nwas the basis for his theory of law in the Doctrine of Right. But on\nCohen\u2019s view of how to apply the transcendental method to\nethics, ethics begins with a theory of law from pure jurisprudence and\nthen, by reflecting on pure law, it seeks to construct a general\ntheory of the moral agent and its will. Thus Cohen\u2019s account of\nthe foundations of ethics might differ fundamentally from\nKant\u2019s\u2014indeed, it might turn Kant\u2019s account on its\nhead.\n7. The Kantian Foundations of Democratic Socialism, Aesthetics\n\nHowever, while a doctrine of pure, universal laws makes possible a\ncoherent theory of the concept of humanity, Cohen thinks the laws of\nany actual state will fall short of pure law\u2019s ideal form. He\nmaintains that states, in the course of their development through\nhistory, tend to amend their laws so as to better approximate the\nideal laws. Cohen does not argue from some antecedent philosophical\ntheory of human nature that history is somehow compelled to exhibit\nthis progress (Cohen 1902, 37). Rather, he simply accepts it as a\ndatum of history: philosophy can no more deny this progress than it\ncan deny progress in the history of physics and mathematics. At the\nsame time, Cohen\u2019s optimism was tempered by an awareness of\ninjustice in the non-ideal world: moral progress must be unending,\nprecisely because no actual state will ever realize the ideal\ncompletely (Schwarzschild 1979, 139\u201340). During the World War,\nCohen even came to believe that certain forms of nationalism might be\nineliminable engines of humanity\u2019s historical progress towards a\ncosmopolitan confederation of ideal states. (See Vatter 2017 for\ndiscussion of the tension between Cohen\u2019s liberal\ncosmopolitanism and his wartime nationalism.) There is, in\nCohen\u2019s terms, an unbridgeable gap between Being and the\nOught.\n\nAs Cohen saw it, political progress was, and ought to be, moving\ntowards democratic socialism. The laws of an undemocratic state cannot\ngenuinely reconcile the wills of individuals and pluralities of\nindividuals, even if the state has the power to control their\nbehavior. So, Cohen argued in his 1904 essay \u201cThe General,\nEqual, and Direct Right Vote,\u201d any state whose laws make the\nwills of individuals and pluralities cohere must be one with universal\nsuffrage (van der Linden 1988, 215). He thus opposed Wilhelmine\nGermany\u2019s system of tiered suffrage, under which lower-class men\nfrom some regions voted only in national elections and women did not\nvote at all.\n\nMoreover, Cohen argued that, as states amend their laws to better\napproximate ideal laws, legal frameworks should emerge to govern the\neconomic activity of democratically-constituted pluralities of people.\nIn other words, he thought that an ideal state would allow democratic\nworkers\u2019 collectives to own the means of production. In his\nEthics of Pure Will as well as his 1896\n\u201cPostscript\u201d to F.A. Lange\u2019s History of\nMaterialism, Cohen argues that this socialism follows\nstraightforwardly from a proper understanding of Kant\u2019s\ncategorical imperative (Cohen 1902, 320). For Cohen, not treating\npeople merely as a means entails not exploiting their labor (Holzhey\n2005, 26). Along with Lange, Cohen thus advocated a socialism with\nKantian and liberal foundations, rather than Marxist ones. (The 1890\nrepeal of Bismark\u2019s Anti-Socialist Laws would have offered him\nsome evidence that Germany was moving towards that democratic\nsocialist ideal.) Cohen\u2019s Kantian socialism was an important\ninfluence on socialist political leaders such as Eduard Bernstein, a\nsocial democratic member of the Reichstag (Gay 1970).\n\nPolitics was not the only sphere in which Cohen thought philosophy\nmust engage with culture. In the third part of his System of\nPhilosophy, the Aesthetics of Pure Feeling (1912), he\nargued that critical philosophy could not leave art without a\nphilosophical foundation (Cohen 1982 [1912], 1.4). In his aesthetics,\nCohen sought to avoid Schelling and Hegel\u2019s view that art is an\nexpression of ideas that can be distilled from it and expressed in\npurely conceptual terms. Likewise, Cohen rejected Helmholtz\u2019s\nphysiological approach to aesthetics, exemplified by his physiological\nand experimental investigation of tone-perception in music. However,\nin Cohen\u2019s theory of knowledge and ethics, he had avoided these\napproaches by adhering to the transcendental method\u2014that is, by\nstarting with a \u201cfact\u201d of (natural or juridical) science\nand then articulating the a priori, universal laws that constitute\nthat science\u2019s object. But for Cohen, there is no \u201cscience\nof art.\u201d Thus for Cohen, a philosophical aesthetics must begin\nwith only the \u201cfact\u201d that art is central to culture (Poma\n1997, Ch. 7; Guyer 2008).\n\nFrom this starting point, Cohen develops an account of \u201cpure\nfeeling.\u201d Pure feeling cannot be the consciousness of the\nobjects of natural science or the moral consciousness of ethical\nideals. But these two domains of objects \u2013 the world as it is\nand the world as it ought to be \u2013 are the only possible objects\nwe can be conscious of. Thus, Cohen argues, pure feeling must be the\nconsciousness that we are conscious. That is, it is our basic\nlevel of consciousness of the fact that we can be conscious of both\nthe objects of natural science and of ethical ideals (Guyer 2008).\nFurther, Cohen characterizes that basic level of consciousness as\n\u201clawfulness\u201d (Gesetzlichkeit) (Cohen 1982 [1912],\n1.68ff; cf. de Launay 2005). According to Cohen, this lawfulness of\npure feeling is what produces the object of aesthetic judgment.\n(Trochimska-Kubacka 2018 provides a useful survey of how Cohen\u2019s\nmature aesthetics differs from Kant\u2019s.)\n\nApart from systematic philosophical considerations, Cohen\u2019s\naesthetics is of interest for the light it promises to shed on his\nphilosophy of religion. Cohen came to believe that concepts central to\nphilosophy of religion should be articulated by interpreting\nhistorical scriptural texts, including prayers and biblical poetry and\nprose (Kepnes 2007, Ch. 2) (see \u00a79 below). Thus recent\ncommentators have used Cohen\u2019s account of lyric poetry in the\nAesthetics of Pure Feeling to help make sense of his account\nof an individual\u2019s love for God (Poma 2000), as well as his\nconception of compassion (Wiedebach 2002).\n8. Philosophy of Religion and the Correlation between the Individual and God\n\nCohen retired from Marburg in 1912, in order to teach at the Academy\nof Jewish Sciences, a rabbinical seminary in Berlin, where he remained\nuntil his death. In 1908 he had written his Ethics of\nMaimonides, and after 1912 he worked above all else on religious\nphilosophy, writing The Concept of Religion in the System of\nPhilosophy (1915) and his monumental Religion of Reason Out\nof the Sources of Judaism, which appeared in 1919, after his\ndeath. The Religion\u2019s significance is difficult to\noverstate: it has been called \u201cthe single most consequential\nwork of Judaic thought in the period of the nineteenth and twentieth\ncenturies\u201d (Dietrich 2000). In it, Cohen articulates a\nconception of a \u201creligion of reason,\u201d and argues that\nfundamental concepts of Judaism, as they are revealed in historical\nJewish texts, were the original sources of that religion of\nreason.\n\nCohen initially faces a problem in defining the relation of religion\nto systematic philosophy (Holzhey 2000). In both the Concept of\nReligion and the Religion of Reason, he identifies the\ntwo central concepts of religion as humanity and God (Cohen 1972\n[1919], 11ff.) But he had already offered philosophical accounts of\nthose concepts in his ethics. For Cohen, ethics is the theory\nprecisely of humanity. But also, in his Ethics of Pure Will,\nCohen defined God as the conjunction of two ideas: the concept of\nideal ethical laws unifying all humanity into a harmonious realm of\nends, and the faith that, at the end of history, this ideal would be\nrealized. Thus Cohen\u2019s ethics seem to offer complete, systematic\naccounts of both of religion\u2019s central concepts. Consequently,\nCohen appears to face a dilemma: religion has a distinctive role to\nplay in philosophy just in case his philosophical ethics offered only\nincomplete accounts of humanity and God. But this is unacceptable to\nCohen.\n\nCohen must thus offer an account of the distinctiveness of religion in\nrelation to systematic philosophy, and do so in a way that does not\nentail the incompleteness of his ethics. The crux of his account of\nreligion\u2019s distinctiveness seems to be the vaguely Tolstoyan\nassumption that insofar as individuals are moral, they are alike, but\nthat every individual is immoral in his or her own way. In the\nReligion, Cohen claims that systematic philosophical ethics\nis concerned with individuals only insofar as they are members of\npluralities or humanity as a whole\u2014that is, only insofar as they\nare bound by ethical laws. But this is not the only way to conceive of\nindividuals. We can also recognize an individual\u2019s particular\nmoral failings, and we can recognize the particular ways an individual\nsuffers because of those failings (Zank 2000). When we recognize an\nindividual this way, Cohen says (appropriating Feuerbach\u2019s\nvocabulary) we recognize the individual as a \u201cThou,\u201d\nrather than merely as a \u201cHe,\u201d a generic representative of\nhumanity. On Cohen\u2019s account, it thus turns out that systematic\nphilosophical ethics does not address certain pervasive features of\nour lived moral experience: our varied, multiple, and particular moral\nfailings, as well the suffering they bring us (Bonaunet 2005, 49ff.).\nThis is not, he thinks, a criticism of ethics for being incomplete. It\nis only the recognition of what ethics is, and is not, concerned\nwith.\n\nReligion, however, is concerned precisely with the individual\u2019s\nparticular moral failings (Zank 1996 and 2000). While we can recognize\nanother individual as a \u201cThou,\u201d and so assess her\nparticular moral failings, Cohen thinks the most important person to\nrecognize as a \u201cThou\u201d is ourselves. As he puts it, we\ndiscover the \u201cI\u201d only by means of the \u201cThou.\u201d\nThat is, we recognize our moral selves by recognizing our own\nparticular moral failings. As he puts it, \u201c[i]n myself, I have\nto study sin, and through sin I must learn to know myself\u201d\n(Cohen 1972 [1919], 22). Without first discovering our own particular\nmoral failings, we could not strive for moral improvement. But for\nCohen, this process of moral improvement is inherently religious.\nPrayer gives us the strength to overcome our hypocrisy and\nself-deceit. And only when we do that can we confess, that is,\nacknowledge our own moral failings. This in turn makes it possible for\nus to atone, that is, to strive to realize our ethical ideals in ways\nthat respond appropriately to our particular failings (Horwitz 2000;\nZank 2000). Thus, for Cohen, knowledge of our own moral selves is the\n\u201cdeepest ground\u201d of religion: \u201c[t]he discovery of\nhumanity through sin is the source from which every religious\ndevelopment flows\u201d (Cohen 1972 [1919], 20).\n\nBy striving for moral improvement, the individual relates herself to\nher ethical ideals. But since for Cohen our concept of ideal ethical\nlaws just is our idea of God (or at least a component of our idea of\nGod), an individual\u2019s striving for moral improvement relates her\nto God. In Cohen\u2019s terms, striving for moral improvement\nestablishes a \u201ccorrelation\u201d between the individual and\nGod. This correlation is a profoundly personal relationship: since the\nindividual confesses and atones for her own particular sins, she\nrelates herself to God in a way that is similarly particular to her.\nIn relating herself to God, Cohen thinks, the individual thereby\nconstitutes herself as a unique moral and religious self, and God\nbecomes her \u201cguide on the long road from sin to virtue\u201d\n(Cohen 1919, 20).\n\nThus Cohen maintains that there is a distinctive role in philosophy\nfor a religion of reason: its distinctive concern is precisely with\nthe particularities of individual humans\u2019 lived moral\nexperience, and their attempts to overcome their various and different\nmoral failings as they strive to realize ideal ethical laws.\n\nNevertheless, almost since before Cohen\u2019s ink was dry, there\nhave been significant disagreements about the proper interpretation of\nCohen\u2019s account of the relation between religion and his\nsystematic philosophy, and of his account of the individual\u2019s\nrelation to God.\n\nAn early and enormously influential reaction to Cohen\u2019s view was\nhis friend Franz Rosenzweig\u2019s. Rosenzweig argued that\nCohen\u2019s concern in the Religion with the concrete\nindividual, expressed in the idea of the individual\u2019s\n\u201ccorrelation\u201d with God, constituted a decisive break from\nthe Ethics of Pure Will\u2019s concern with universal laws\nof human action (Rosenzweig 1924). On Rosenzweig\u2019s\ninterpretation, in the Religion Cohen abandons the\nrationalism that characterizes his earlier conception of humanity\nworking out its relation to God in a historical process of improving\nthe laws by which it governs itself. Instead, Rosenzweig suggests,\nCohen commits himself to a conception of the religious individual that\nis more fundamental than universal, rational ethical considerations.\nThus for Rosenzweig, despite Cohen\u2019s claims to the contrary, his\nviews in the Religion are fundamentally discontinuous with\nhis views in his systematic ethics.\n\nMore recently, Robert Erlewine (2010) has offered a different account\nof how Cohen\u2019s Religion might break decisively with his\nsystematic ethics. Cohen\u2019s ethics are concerned with how\npluralities of different wills are unified into law-governed\ntotalities (cf \u00a76 above). In his Ethics of Pure Will,\nCohen argues that different wills are so unified in the ideal state.\nBut, Erlewine argues, Cohen defends a different view in his Ethics\nof Maimonides and his Religion. For Cohen in those\nworks, on Erlewine\u2019s account, different wills are unified in the\nlaw-governed community of the religious, and specifically Jewish,\ncongregation.\n\nIn contrast, others have defended the consistency of Cohen\u2019s\nviews, arguing that the Religion completes the systematic\nethical project he had started in his Ethics of Pure Will.\nCohen\u2019s ethics is concerned with the constitution of the will,\nthat is, the moral self. But this moral self is an ideal, and thus it\nis only in the Religion that Cohen takes up the question of\nthe human self as a concrete individual. Consequently, Schwarzschild\n(1975) argues that Cohen\u2019s account of the concrete individual in\nthe Religion completes the theory of moral selfhood begun in\nthe Ethics of Pure Will. Alternatively, Poma (1988) argues\nthat the religious idea of God, since it is the idea not only of\nuniversal ethical ideals, but of humanity\u2019s progress towards\nthose ideals, provides a connection between the descriptive and\nnormative aspects of Cohen\u2019s philosophy.\n\nHowever, if Cohen\u2019s philosophy of religion completes\nthe project of his systematic ethics, it is difficult to see how to\navoid the implication that Cohen\u2019s systematic ethics were,\nconsidered on their own, incomplete \u2013 a claim Cohen himself was\nat pains to deny.\n\nThe debate about these two broad interpretive strategies has, at\ntimes, taken on the significance of a debate about how best to view\nCohen an an intellectual. That is, the debate is not simply about\nwhether to prefer an interpretation emphasizing a sharp discontinuity\nbetween Cohen\u2019s views in the Religion and his earlier\nviews, or an interpretation emphasizing continuity in his views.\nRather, as Daniel Weiss points out, the debate has sometimes been\nabout whether to understand Cohen first and foremost as a Jewish\nthinker or primarily as a neo-Kantian philosopher (Weiss 2012,\n5ff).\n\nHowever, a third interpretive strategy seeks to avoid this dichotomy,\nby avoiding both the claim that Cohen\u2019s Religion is a\ndecisive \u201cbreak\u201d with his systematic ethics and the claim\nthat his religion \u201ccompletes\u201d those ethics. Michael Zank\n(1996 and especially 2000) has emphasized that Cohen did not intend\nhis philosophy of religion to be part of the System of\nPhilosophy, but nor can the philosophy of religion be in any\nsense a \u201cbreak\u201d from the Ethics of Pure Will in\nhis System, since he started working on both projects at\nroughly the same time around the turn of the century. Cohen\u2019s\nsystematic philosophy and his philosophy of religion thus stand as\ncomplements to each other: whereas one conceives the human as an ideal\nagent constituted by universal ethical laws, the other treats the\nhuman as a concrete individual, constituted by the particularities of\nhis own moral failings and attempts to atone for them. Similarly,\nWeiss (2012) argues that the religious and ethical conception of the\nindividual are different \u201cvoices\u201d in Cohen that cannot be\nreduced to a simple, theoretical unity (in the System of\nPhilosophy), but that both voices are necessary.\n9. Monotheism and Prophetic Messianism\n\nCohen\u2019s second aim in the Religion is to show that\nJudaism has what he calls a special \u201cmethodological\u201d\nsignificance for philosophy of religion, because it is the original\nhistorical source of a religion of reason (Cohen 1972 [1919], 8).\nJudaism has this special status because it was, Cohen contends, the\noriginal monotheistic religion, and only monotheistic religions can be\nreligions of reason. The polytheism of the ancient world posited\ndifferent gods for different peoples in different places. But, Cohen\nargues, since reason is a \u201cuniversal human power\u201d that\nbelongs to all humanity (Cohen 1972 [1919], 7\u20138), a religion of\nreason cannot recognize different gods for different people, but must\nrecognize a single, unique God for all humanity. Since the idea of\nsuch a God first emerged in history with Judaism, it is the original\nsource of a religion of reason. Consequently, the investigation of a\nreligion of reason must recover that religion\u2019s source by\ninterpreting the historical scriptures and liturgical practices of\nJudaism (Kepnes 2007, Ch. 2).\n\nAccording to Cohen, monotheism, and so too Judaism, was the historical\nsource of the idea that all humanity could be unified by a single set\nof ethical laws. As Cohen sees it, God is the set of ideal ethical\nlaws. To assert that there is only one God for all of humanity is thus\nto assert a universal ethical ideal, one on which individuals see all\npeople as \u201cfellow humans,\u201d and not as \u201cothers\u201d\nwho can be excluded from the moral community (Cohen 1972 [1919],\n14ff). Later religion scholars such as Wendell Dietrich would call\nthis doctrine \u201cethical monotheism\u201d (Cf. Dietrich 1986 and\nTheodore and Hadley 2001). Cohen thinks that because monotheism has an\nethical dimension, it culminates in\u2014its highest form is\u2014a\nview he calls prophetic messianism. For Cohen, messianism just is\n\u201cthe dominion of the good on earth.\u201d It is the view that\nthe Messiah\u2019s coming consists in nothing but the ultimate end of\ninjustice (Cohen 1972 [1919], 21). Prophetic messianism is thus an\nexpression of faith that humanity is making progress towards realizing\nideal ethical laws.\n\nCohen\u2019s conception of the essentially ethical nature of Judaism\nhad important consequences for his view of Judaism\u2019s relation to\nother religions, as well as his views of Zionism and the Jews\u2019\nplace in Wilhelmine Germany. Because Cohen thought the ethical nature\nof Judaism was expressed by its monotheism, he believed that at least\nsome forms of Christianity had the same ethical nature. While for\nCohen Judaism was the original religion of reason, liberal\nProtestantism expresses universal ethical ideals and is a religion of\nreason as well. (He thought Catholicism failed to express properly\nuniversal ideals. He seems not to have considered Islam.) At the same\ntime, because for Cohen Judaism ultimately aims at an ethical ideal\nthat includes all humanity, he rejected the nationalism he saw in\nnon-liberal forms of Judaism and was a vocal critic of Zionism. In a\npublic exchange with Martin Buber, Cohen argued that Jews had an\nobligation to remain in their countries of birth, so that their\nreligious communities could serve as exemplars for the rest of\nhumanity of communities unified by ethical laws. He died in 1918,\nbefore the increasing virulence of antisemitism in Germany could make\nhim reconsider this argument.\n10. Cohen\u2019s Influence\n\nThe range of Cohen\u2019s influence is wide. Few figures are as\nimportant for Jewish ethics and philosophy of religion in the\ntwentieth century, and in the last four decades religion scholars\nhave devoted considerable attention to understanding Cohen\u2019s\nsignificance as a religious thinker and public intellectual. More\nrecently, historians of philosophy in the analytic tradition have\nbegun to appreciate the importance of Cohen\u2019s neo-Kantianism as\na source not only of influential interpretations of Kant, but of the\ntopics and methods characteristic of philosophy of science in the\ntwentieth century.\n\nIn Jewish religious thought, Cohen\u2019s influence is highly\nvisible, and substantive doctrines he developed in the Ethics of\nPure Will and the Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of\nJudaism are still topics of debate. Martin Buber\u2019s 1923\nI and Thou was explicitly indebted to, and a response to,\nCohen\u2019s Religion. Inspired by Cohen (see \u00a78\nabove), Buber elaborated an account of a relationship between the\n\u201cI\u201d and the \u201cThou.\u201d Like Cohen, for Buber this\nrelation is the central part of how an individual establishes a\nprofoundly personal relationship with God. Also like Cohen, Buber\nthinks establishing that relationship with God is essential to\nstrengthening the ethical bonds in one\u2019s community. But unlike\nCohen, Buber thought the I-Thou relationship was essentially beyond\nlanguage\u2019s ability to express\u2014a view strikingly at odds\nwith Cohen\u2019s rationalist philosophical tendencies.\n\nMore recently, religious ethicists have been interested in\nCohen\u2019s view that monotheism expresses a universalist morality,\nand that it expressed for the first time in history the idea that all\nhumanity must be subject to the same ethical laws. The religion\nscholar Wendell Dietrich (Dietrich 1986) identifies this view as\n\u201cethical monotheism,\u201d and sees Cohen as the first in a\ntrajectory of religious philosophers who argue that the concept of a\nunique God is necessary for\u2014or whose essential content is\nrevealed to us as (Gibbs 2001)\u2014ethical laws and the freedom to\nlive according to them. Avi Bernstein-Nahar (1998 and 2006) argues\nthat Cohen\u2019s ethics, and perhaps his ethical monotheism in\nparticular, provide the intellectual basis for a Jewish identity that\ncan be shared by various Jewish communities that might otherwise have\nlittle in common. On this view, Cohen\u2019s ethics thus have a\ncentral role to play in Jewish education.\n\nCohen\u2019s influence on Anglo-American analytic philosophy is less\nvisible. Perhaps the only area of Anglo-American philosophy where a\nsubstantive doctrine of Cohen\u2019s is still respected is Kant\ninterpretation. Before Cohen\u2019s Kant\u2019s Theory of\nExperience, interpretations of Kant were\noverwhelmingly\u2014some have claimed\nexclusively\u2014psychologistic in one way or another (see \u00a72\nabove). Some of those interpretations attributed to Kant a form of\nidealistic transcendental psychology, what Hegel called\n\u201csubjective idealism.\u201d Others attributed to Kant some form\nof empirical psychologism. But Cohen denies that Kant is interested in\nhow the mind\u2014either the transcendental mind or the empirical\nmind\u2014operates to synthesize the knower\u2019s representations.\nFor Cohen, Kant is interested in knowledge considered as if laid out\n\u201cin printed books\u201d (Cohen 1877, 27).\n\nCohen is thus at the head of a tradition of anti-psychologistic\ninterpretations of Kant that includes Kant scholars such as Peter\nStrawson and, more recently, Henry Allison. It would overstate\nCohen\u2019s influence to suggest that he directly inspired, say,\nStrawson\u2019s interpretation of Kant. But the anti-psychologistic\nphilosophical environment in which Strawson produced his Kant\ninterpretation owed a great deal to Cohen\u2019s influence. (Cf. Edel\n1993 for a discussion of Cohen\u2019s anti-psychologism in relation\nto the tradition of analytic philosophy to which Strawson belongs.)\nFurther, as English-language Kant interpretation became more\nsophisticated over the second half of the twentieth century and\nengaged more seriously with existing German literature, historians of\nphilosophy like Allison found themselves at home in a much longer\nGerman tradition of anti-psychologistic Kant interpretation going back\ndirectly to Cohen. That anti-psychologistic tradition dominated\nAnglo-American Kant interpretation for the latter decades of the\ntwentieth century and is still the majority view today.\n\nHowever, it would be a mistake to limit a survey of Cohen\u2019s\ninfluence on contemporary analytic philosophy to the doctrines of his\nthat are still alive today. Arguably his most profound influence on\nanalytic philosophy has not been to give us particular philosophical\ndoctrines, but to contribute to the basic shape, the basic orientation\nof an entire major subdiscipline of philosophy. Nowhere is this more\nevident than in history and philosophy of science (cf. Patton\n2005).\n\nRecent history of philosophy of science has become increasingly aware\nof neo-Kantianism\u2019s influence on philosophy of science in the\ntwentieth century. It is thus worth taking seriously Cohen\u2019s\nrole in shaping twentieth-century philosophy of science. His\ncommitment to the transcendental method lead him to a view of\nepistemology, and theoretical philosophy more generally, as\nessentially a philosophically critical account of the historical\ndevelopment of concepts in the mathematically-precise natural\nsciences. This view of a historically-oriented philosophy of science\nis nowhere more clear in Cohen\u2019s work than in his Principle\nof the Infinitesimal Method. There are two significant points\nabout the view he expresses there. First, for Cohen, the theory of\nknowledge begins by accepting a body of existing science, and then\ngives a philosophical reconstruction of important concepts and\ndevelopments in that science\u2019s history. Second, Cohen thinks the\nprincipal topic of the theory of knowledge is mathematically-precise\nnatural science\u2014paradigmatically mathematics and physics.\nCohen\u2019s disciple, Ernst Cassirer, would carry out this program\nin, among other writings, three books on the history and philosophy of\nphysics.\n\nBut philosophers far beyond the Marburg School were influenced by\nCohen\u2019s insistence that the philosophical reconstruction of\nscientific theories is the principal method of the theory of\nknowledge, and that its principal topic is mathematically-precise\nnatural science. Logical positivist philosophy of science took up\naspects of Cohen\u2019s project, including its central concern with\nmathematics and physics. Like Cohen, positivists also thought\nphilosophy should accept existing bodies of science as a starting\npoint, and should seek to reconstruct that science\u2019s theories\nand methods, even though they thought modern logic was the proper tool\nfor carrying out their reconstructions. (Cf. Richardson 2006 and\nFerrari 2018 for discussions of Cohen\u2019s philosophy in relation\nto logical empiricism.) Recent scholarship on logical positivism, and\nespecially on Rudolf Carnap, has emphasized its intellectual debts to\nMarburg School neo-Kantianism. (Cf. Friedman 1999 and 2000; Richardson\n1998 and especially 2006.) Conversely, a French tradition of\nphilosophy of science emphasized a different aspect of Cohen\u2019s\nproject. The neo-Kantian Emile Meyerson, and his intellectual heirs,\nAlexandre Koyr\u00e9 and ultimately Thomas Kuhn, emphasized a more\ndeeply historical reconstruction of scientific theories and methods.\nFinally, more recent philosophy of science has seen a turn back to\nviews even more explicitly inspired by Marburg School doctrines: most\nprominently, Michael Friedman has defended the view that in\nreconstructing scientific theories, philosophy should seek to\narticulate the \u201cconstitutively a priori\u201d principles in\nthose theories\u2014that is, principles that are constitutive of the\npossibility of experience in precisely Cohen\u2019s sense (Friedman\n2001; cf. Giovanelli 2018). More generally, although twentieth-century\nhistory and philosophy of science did not always take seriously\nCohen\u2019s substantive doctrines, it was nevertheless affected\nprofoundly by his vision of philosophy as the reconstruction of\nhistorical developments in mathematically-precise natural science.\n",
