The logic of Grundgesetze\ncontains a mere six axioms, now called Basic Laws, including\nthe completely new axioms required to deal with value ranges and the\nbackslash operator. This is not, however, mere reorganization.\nInstead, in the logic of Grundgesetze Frege replaces a number\nof the axioms found in Begriffsschrift with corresponding\nrules that are much more flexible, and hence much more powerful, in\ntheir application. For an insightful discussion of what the\nGrundgesetze-era Frege takes to be characteristics of a Basic\nLaw (as opposed to any other logical truth derivable from the Basic\nLaws and rules of inference) and their relation to proof, see Pedriali\n(2019).\n3.3.1 Basic Law I\n\nFrege\u2019s Basic Law I looks familiar, since, syntactically at\nleast, it is just\n Axiom 1\n from the logic of Begriffsschrift:\n\n\n\nBasic Law I (1893/1903: \u00a718)\n\n\nIn Grundgesetze Frege justifies Basic Law I as follows:\n\n\nWe will now set up some general laws for Roman letters which we will\nhave to make use of later. According to \u00a712: \n\n\n\n\n\nwould be the False only if \\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(\\Delta\\) were the True\nwhile \\(\\Gamma\\) was not the True. This is impossible; accordingly:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1893/1903: \u00a718) \n\n\nGiven the discussion above (and Frege\u2019s careful use of \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\nwas not the True\u201d rather\nthan \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\) was the False\u201d\nin the justification of the Basic Law), it is no surprise that this\nexpression is a name of the True even when the objects named by \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d\nand \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d\nare not truth-values. The\nreader is encouraged to verify, for example, that: \n\n\n\n\n\nis a name of the True. Frege notes that: \n\n\n\n\n\nis a special instance of the formulation of Basic Law I above,\nobtained by replacing \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d\nwith \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d and then fusing\nequal subcomponents (1893/1903: \u00a718). Given its obvious utility,\nFrege lists this as a second version of Basic Law I, one that we can\nuse as a primitive axiom without explicitly deriving it.\n3.3.2 Basic Law II\n\nBasic Law II also looks familiar, as it is the Grundgesetze\nanalogue of Axiom 9 from the logic of Begriffsschrift. Now\nthat Frege has a clear conception of the the hierarchy of object,\nfirst-level function, second-level function, and third-level function\nin place, and now that he has distinct quantifiers that range,\nrespectively, over different \u201clevels\u201d of entity from\nwithin this hierarchy, he is careful to formulate both a\n\u201cfirst-order\u201d version and a \u201csecond-order\u201d\nversion of the Basic Law in question. The first version, Basic Law IIa\nis:\n\n\n\n\nBasic Law IIa (1893/1903: \u00a720)\n\n\nFrege describes this Basic Law as expressing the thought that\n\u201cwhat holds of all objects, also holds of any\u201d (1893/1903:\n\u00a720). Basic Law IIa, combined with the generalized version of\nmodus ponens used in Grundgesetze (and discussed\nbelow) provides a means for inferring a Roman letter generality from a\ngenerality formulated using the concavity. Given a concavity\nproposition of the form \u201c\n\n\\(\\Phi(\\mathfrak{a})\\)\u201d, we can invoke an instance of\nBasic Law IIa: \n\n\n\n\n\nand combine these, using modus ponens, to conclude \u201c\n\n\\(\\Phi(a)\\)\u201d. \n\nThe second-order version of Basic Law II is called Basic Law IIb:\n\n\n\n\nBasic Law IIb (1893/1903: \u00a725)\n\n\nNote that the occurrence of \u201c\\(\\mathfrak{f}\\)\u201d\nin the\nsubcomponent, and \u201c\\(f\\)\u201d in the\nsupercomponent, are distinct variables (the former is a German letter,\nthe latter a Roman letter).\n3.3.3 Basic Law III\n\nBasic Law III, the Grundgesetze principle governing the\nequality-sign, appears at first glance to be a slight variant of the\nindiscernibility of identicals:\n\n\n\n\nBasic Law III (1893/1903: \u00a720)\n\n\nIf we replace the Roman letter \u201c\\(g\\)\u201d\nby the horizontal, and the\napply fusion of horizontals, we do indeed obtain the\nGrundgesetze version of the indiscernibility of identicals:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic Law III is a good bit more powerful than this, however.\n\nBasic Law III states that for any unary first-level function name\n\u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\)\u201d and any proper\nnames \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d,\nit is not the case that\nthe application of the function named by \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\)\u201d\nto the truth-value\nnamed by \u201c\\(\\Delta = \\Gamma\\)\u201d\nis the True, while application of the function named by \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\)\u201d\nto the truth-value\nnamed by: \n\n\n\n\n\nis something other than the True. Thus, this axiom amounts to the\nclaim that one can always replace an equality with the corresponding\nuniversally quantified expression anywhere in a proposition (i.e., as\nthe argument of any function \\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\)).\n\nThe negation stroke is, of course, one of the functions that can be\nsubstituted for \u201c\\(g\\)\u201d. Thus,\nthe following is a substitution instance of Basic Law III: \n\n\n\n\n\nwhich (although we have not yet discussed the generalized\ncontraposition rule required) is equivalent to: \n\n\n\n\n\nThus, Basic Law III implies a Grundgesetze analogue of the\nidentity of indiscernibles. As a result, Frege has no need for an\nanalogue of Begriffsschrift\u2019s Axiom 8 within the logic\nof Grundgesetze, since he proves: \n\n\n\n\n\nby first proving: \n\n\n\n\n\nand then applying Basic Law III (and his Grundgesetze version\nof modus ponens). He calls this principle of self-identity\nIIIe (1893/1903: \u00a750).\n3.3.4 Basic Law IV\n\nBasic Law IV is:\n\n\n\n\nBasic Law IV (1893/1903: \u00a718)\n\n\nThis principle might appear to be nothing more than a\nGrundgesetze analogue of a familiar principle of classical\npropositional logic:  \n\\[(\\neg (\\Delta\n\\leftrightarrow \\neg \\Gamma)) \\rightarrow (\\Delta \\leftrightarrow\n\\Gamma)\\]\n\n\nAs usual, however, we should be careful not to read this axiom as only\napplying to truth-value names. Instead, instances of Basic Law IV name\nthe True no matter what names are substituted in for \n\u201c\\(a\\)\u201d\nand \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d.\nThus: \n\n\n\n\n\nis a name of the True (recall that both \u201c\n\n\\(2\\)\u201d and \u201c\n\n\\(3\\)\u201d are names of the False, \u201c\n\n\\(3\\)\u201d  names the True, and hence both the supercomponent\nand the subcomponent of this instance of Basic Law IV are names of the\nTrue).\n\nUnlike most of the (non-value-range involving) axioms and rules of the\nlogic of Grundgesetze, Basic Law IV has no direct analogue\nwithin the logic of Begriffsschrift (but see the discussion\nof Axioms 5 and 6 below), and its purpose seem to be, in part, to\nenforce the intended interpretation of the horizontal and negation in\ncases where the arguments are not truth-values. Nevertheless, given\nthat all occurrences of Roman letters within Basic Law IV are prefixed\nby the horizontal, the practical import of this principle is much the\nsame as the classical analogue: Given any two truth-values, if the\nfirst is not equal to the negation of the second, then they are\nthemselves equal.\n\nGiven that Basic Law IV, in effect, forces the logic of\nGrundgesetze to be bivalent, we might wonder what happened to\nthe axioms that played this role in the logic of\nBegriffsschrift\u2014Axioms 5 and 6. Grundgesetze\nanalogues of both Axiom 5 and Axiom 6 are proven very early in the\nderivations of Grundgesetze, but, as was the case with Basic\nLaw II, Frege in fact identifies and proves versions that are much\nmore general. The theorems in question are: \n\n\n\n\n\nIVc\n\n\n\n\n\nIVd\n\n\n\nwhich he calls IVc and IVd respectively (1893/1903: \u00a751).\n3.3.5 Basic Law V\n\nIt is somewhat surprising how little fanfare accompanies Frege\u2019s\nintroduction of the now notorious Basic Law V. Frege merely notes\nthat:\n\n\n[\u2026] a value-range equality can always be converted into the\ngenerality of an equality, and vice versa. (1893/1903:\n\u00a720)\n\n\nand then states the axiom:\n\n\n\n\nBasic Law V (1893/1903: \u00a720)\n\n\nThe Grundgesetze formulation of Basic Law V is a good bit\nmore general than well-known modern \u201ctranslations\u201d of this\nlaw within higher-order logic such as:  \n\\[\\forall X\\;\\forall Y(\\S(X) = \\S(Y) \\leftrightarrow \\forall z(X(z)\n\\leftrightarrow Y(z)))\\]\n\n\nwhere the quantifiers range over concepts or properties. The\nGrundgesetze formulation of Basic Law V entails not only that\nevery concept has a corresponding extension, but in addition that any\nfunction whatever (concept or not) has a value-range. Thus, the\nGrundgesetze formulation of Basic Law V also captures\nsomething akin to:  \n\\[\n\\forall f\\;\\forall g(\\S(f) = \\S(g) \\leftrightarrow \\forall z(f(z) = g(z)))\n\\]\n\n\nSince within modern treatments of higher-order logic concepts are a\ndifferent sort from functions, however, rather than being a sub-class\nof the class of functions as in Grundgesetze, Frege\u2019s\nBasic Law V is, strictly speaking, not equivalent to either of these\nmodern formulations.\n3.3.6 Basic Law VI\n\nThe final axiom of Grundgesetze, Basic Law VI, governs the\nbehavior of the backslash:\n\n\n\n\nBasic Law VI (1893/1903: \u00a718)\n\n\nThis axiom makes explicit one part of the informal definition of the\nbackslash operator discussed earlier. If \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d\nis a name of the\nsingleton extension of the object named by \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d,\nthen the result of\napplying the backslash to \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d\nnames the same object as\ndoes \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d. But Basic Law\nVI tells us nothing regarding what results when we apply the backslash\nto a name that is not the name of a singleton extension. We\nmight wonder why Frege did not add a second axiom governing this case,\nsuch as: \n\n\n\n\n\nThe absence of this principle from the deductive system of\nGrundgesetze leads to a striking insight into Frege\u2019s\nmethodology. The question at issue is whether Frege would have taken\nhis logic to be complete\u2014that is, would he have taken it to\nprove every logical truth expressible in the language of\nGrundgesetze. Michael Dummett suggests that:\n\n\nNo doubt Frege would have claimed his axioms, taken together with the\nadditional informal stipulations not embodied in them, as yielding a\ncomplete theory: to impute to him an awareness of the incompleteness\nof higher-order theories would be an anachronism. (1981: 423)\n\n\nThe stipulations Dummett has in mind are the identification of the\ntruth values with their singleton extensions at the conclusion of the\n\u201cPermutation Argument\u201d in \u00a710 of\nGrundgesetze. What the lack of a second instance of Basic Law\nVI reveals, however, is that Frege would have been quite aware of the\nincompleteness of the logic of Grundgesetze (were it not\ninconsistent), since he has failed to include a principle that is\nclearly true on the intended interpretation. Imputing to him an\nawareness of an obvious gap in the logical principles he actually\nincludes in his logic (given the informal semantic elucidations he\nprovides regarding the intended interpretation of his logic) is far\ndifferent from claiming that he was aware of the in principle\nincompleteness of second-order logic, of course.\n\nInterestingly, Heck points out (2012: ch. 2) that Frege claims later\nin Grundgesetze that a proposition \u201cis, it seems,\nunprovable\u201d (Frege 1893/1903: \u00a7114). Frege is careful to\nclaim only that the principle is unprovable, and hence that he will\nnot claim that is is true (i.e., he will not write it as a\njudgement with \u201c\n\n\u201d, but he also refrains from claiming that it is false.\nHeck suggests that Frege was at this point recognizing the potential\nincompleteness of his system (or, at least, of the consistent\nsub-system relevant to the derivations at issue in \u00a7114). What\nprevents Frege from proving the claim in question, and what allows\nDedekind to prove a similar principle in his own treatment of\narithmetic (Dedekind 1888), is that the latter has an informal version\nof the axiom of choice at his disposal, while Frege has included no\nformal version of choice within the logic of Grundgesetze\n(Heck 2012: ch. 2). This is an important observation, but nothing this\nsophisticated is needed in order to conclude that Frege would likely\nhave thought that his system was incomplete.\n\nFrege had no need for an axiom covering the application of the\nbackslash to non-singleton extensions in his derivation of arithmetic\nwithin the formal system of Grundgesetze (and we can presume\nhe also had no need of it in his envisioned derivation of real and\ncomplex analysis). Thus, he did not need to add it to his stock of\nBasic Laws. Frege\u2019s formal system only needs to include those\nlogical principles that are required for his reconstructions of\narithmetic and analysis\u2014his project did not require a logic that\nwas proof-theoretically complete in the modern sense, and as a result\nwe should not be surprised that the logic he did formulate would have\nappeared (to Frege, to his readers, and to us) to be rather obviously\nincomplete (had Basic Law V not rendered it inconsistent, and hence\ntrivially complete).\n3.4 The Rules of Inference of Grundgesetze\n\nDespite frequent claims that Frege\u2019s logic is unwieldy and\ndifficult to use, the rules of inference that Frege formulates\ndemonstrate the opposite: the resulting system, which takes advantage\nof the systematic ambiguity present in Frege\u2019s way of reading\nconditionals, is in many ways more powerful and more elegant than\nmodern deductive systems.\n\nFirst, we remind the reader of the three rules of inference that have\nalready been discussed, and which can be applied in derivations within\nthe logic of Grundgesetze without any comment or label. These\nare the permutation of subcomponents, the fusion of identical\nsubcomponents, and the fusion of horizontals. In addition to these,\nFrege introduces six rules of inference.\n3.4.1 Generalized Modus Ponens\n\nThe first is Generalized Modus Ponens (the term\n\u201cGeneralized Modus Ponens\u201d is not Frege\u2019s, he calls\nthis inference \u201cInferring(a)\u201d), which Frege describes\nthusly:\n\n\nIf a subcomponent of a proposition differs from a second\nproposition only in lacking the judgement-stroke, then one may infer a\nproposition which results from the first by suppressing that\nsubcomponent. (1893/1903: \u00a714)\n\n\nSimply put, if one has proven a Grundgesetze conditional, and\none has also proven a subcomponent of that conditional, then one may\ninfer the result of deleting that subcomponent from the conditional.\nAssume that we have proven the Grundgesetze proposition: \n\n\n\n\n\nThen, if we also have \u201c\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d, then we can conclude: \n\n\n\n\n\nOn this application, we are parsing the conditional in question such\nthat \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d is the\nrelevant subcomponent, and: \n\n\n\n\n\nthe supercomponent. If, on the other hand, we have \u201c\n\n\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d, then we would instead conclude: \n\n\n\n\n\ntreating both \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d and\n\u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d as subcomponents,\nand \u201c\\(\\Theta\\)\u201d as\nsupercomponent. Applications of Generalized Modus Ponens are indicated\nby a solid horizontal line. This is the first instance of a\ntransition sign (1893/1903: \u00a714).\n\nThis rule is an incredibly powerful generalization of the simple\nversion of modus ponens found in Begriffsschrift, or\nincluded in modern deductive systems that use linear notation.\nConsider how many steps would be needed to transition from: \n\n\\[A_1 \\rightarrow (A_2 \\rightarrow (A_3 \\rightarrow\n(A_4 \\rightarrow (A_5 \\rightarrow (A_6 \\rightarrow (A_7 \\rightarrow (A_8\n\\rightarrow B)))))))\\]\n\n\nand \\(A_8\\) to:  \n\\[A_1\n\\rightarrow (A_2 \\rightarrow (A_3 \\rightarrow (A_4 \\rightarrow (A_5\n\\rightarrow (A_6 \\rightarrow (A_7 \\rightarrow B))))))\\]\n\n\nin a typical natural deduction system. Within the logic of\nGrundgesetze, Frege can carry out the analogous deduction in\none step. Similar comments regarding the power of Frege\u2019s rules\nof inference apply to the other rules that take advantage of the fact\nthat Grundgesetze formulas can be parsed into subcomponent(s)\nand supercomponent in more than one way (that is, to Generalized\nHypothetical Syllogism, Generalized Contraposition, and Generalized\nDilemma).\n\nFrege allows for multiple, simultaneous applications of the\ngeneralized form of Generalized Modus Ponens. Thus, if we\nhave proven: \n\n\n\n\n\nand we then prove both \u201c\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d, and \u201c\n\n\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d, we may eliminate both subcomponents\nsimultaneously, marking the transition with a double horizontal line\n(1893/1903: \u00a714).\n3.4.2 Generalized Hypothetical Syllogism\n\nThe next rule of inference is Generalized Hypothetical\nSyllogism (This is again novel terminology\u2014Frege calls this\nrule \u201cInferring(b)\u201d):\n\n\nIf the same combination of signs occurs in one proposition as\nsupercomponent and in another as subcomponent, then a proposition may\nbe inferred in which the supercomponent of the latter features as\nsupercomponent and all subcomponents of both, save that mentioned,\nfeature as subcomponents. However, subcomponents that occur in both\nneed only be written once. (1893/1903: \u00a715)\n\n\nThis is a generalized, and more powerful, version of familiar rule\nhypothetical syllogism that takes advantage of the\n\u201cequal\u201d status of subcomponents: Given a\nGrundgesetze proposition, and a second proposition whose\nsupercomponent is a subcomponent of the first, we can infer the\nproposition that results from replacing the relevant subcomponent in\nthe first proposition with the subcomponents of the second\nproposition. For example, if we have derived both of: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthen we can combine these to obtain: \n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we have combined the two occurrences of \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d\ninto a single occurrence.\nApplications of Generalized Hypothetical Syllogism are indicated by\nnew type of transition sign, a dashed horizontal line\n\u201c\u2014\u2013 \u2013 \u2013\u201d, and multiple\nsimultaneous applications of Generalized Hypothetical Syllogism are\nindicated by the double dashed horizontal line \u201c= = = =\u201d.\nGeneralized Hypothetical Syllogism is a much more powerful rule-based\nform of Axiom 2 from the logic of Begriffsschrift.\n3.4.3 Generalized Contraposition\n\nThe third rule of inference is Generalized Contraposition\n(Frege calls this rule merely \u201ccontraposition\u201d).\n\n\nOne may permute a subcomponent with a supercomponent provided one\nsimultaneously reverses the truth-value of each. (1893/1903:\n\u00a715)\n\n\nGeneralized contraposition allows us to \u201cswitch\u201d the\nsupercomponent of a Grundgesetze proposition with\nany subcomponent of it, provided one \u201csimultaneously\nreverses the truth-value of each\u201d. Recalling the fact\nthat Frege describes negation as \u201ca sign by means of which every\ntruth-value is transformed into its opposite\u201d (1893/1903:\n\u00a76), this amounts to either adding a single negation to, or\nremoving a single negation from (if at least one negation is present),\neach of the formulas in question. Thus, if we have derived: \n\n\n\n\n\nthen Generalized Contraposition would allows us to obtain any of the\nfollowing: \n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\n\nApplications of generalized contraposition are represented using the\ntransition sign \u201c\\(\\Large\n\\times\\)\u201d. Generalized Contraposition is a much more\npowerful rule-based version of Axiom 4 from the logic of\nBegriffsschrift.\n3.4.4 Generalized Dilemma\n\nThe fourth rule of inference is Generalized Dilemma (Frege\ncalls this \u201cInferring(c)\u201d):\n\n\nIf two propositions agree in their supercomponents while a\nsubcomponent of the one differs from a subcomponent of the other only\nby a prefixed negation stroke, then we can infer a proposition in\nwhich the common supercomponent features as supercomponent, and all\nsubcomponents of both propositions with the exception of the two\nmentioned feature as subcomponents. In this, subcomponents which occur\nin both propositions need only be written down once. (1893/1903:\n\u00a716)\n\n\nThus, if we have derived Grundgesetze propositions of the\nform: \n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\nwe can infer: \n\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized Dilemma is indicated by the dot-dashed line \u201c\\(\\cdot\\!-\\!\\cdot\\!-\\!\\cdot\\!-\\!\\cdot\\)\u201d.\n\nGeneralized Dilemma is the only official axiom or rule found in the\nlogic of Grundgesetze, other than those that explicitly\ninvolve value-ranges, that does not have some clear (even if much\nweaker) analogue in the logic of Begriffsschrift, (assuming\nwe count Axioms 5 and 6 as at least very loose analogues of Basic Law\nIV\u2014see above), although an analogue of the rule is of course\nderivable in the earlier system (to put it in contemporary\nterms). After noting, in the Preface to Begriffsschrift, that\nhe has limited himself to as few axioms and rules of inference as\npossible, Frege writes that:\n\n\nThis does not rule out, later, transitions from several\njudgements to a new one, which are possible by this single mode of\ninference only in an indirect way, being converted into direct ones\nfor the sake of abbreviation. In fact, this may be advisable for later\napplications. In this way, then, further modes of inference would\narise. (1879a: Preface)\n\n\nIn the Foreword to Grundgesetze, however, Frege notes a\nrather notable shift in strategy:\n\n\nIn order to attain more flexibility and to avoid excessive length, I\nhave allowed myself tacit use of permutation of subcomponents\n(conditions) and fusion of equal subcomponents, and have not reduced\nthe modes of inference and consequence to a minimum. Anyone acquainted\nwith my little book Begriffsschrift will gather from it how\nhere too one could satisfy the strictest demands, but also that this\nwould result in a considerable increase in extent. (1893/1903:\nForeword)\n\n\nPresumably it is Generalized Dilemma, in particular, that Frege has in\nmind here.\n3.4.5 Concavity Introduction\n\nFrege\u2019s next rule of inference, which we will (following our\ndiscussion of the analogous rule in the logic of\nBegriffsschrift) call Concavity Introduction (Frege\ncall this rule \u201cTransformation of a Roman letter into a German\nletter\u201d), governs the interactions between the two devices for\nexpressing generality within Grundgesetze, the Roman letter\ngenerality device and the concavity:\n\n\nA Roman letter may be replaced whenever it occurs in a proposition\nby one and the same German letter. At the same time, the latter has to\nbe placed above a concavity in front of one such supercomponent\noutside of which the Roman letter does not occur. If in this\nsupercomponent the scope of a German letter is contained and the Roman\nletter occurs within this scope, then the German letter that is to be\nintroduced for the latter must be distinct from the former.\n(1893/1903: \u00a717)\n\n\nMechanically speaking, this is the same rule as the version of\nConcavity Introduction given in the logic of Begriffsschrift.\nThe transition symbol used to label applications of concavity\nintroduction is \u201c\\(\\raise\n1ex{\\underparen{\\hspace{1.5em}}}\\)\u201d.\n3.4.6 Roman Letter Elimination\n\nWhile Concavity Introduction allows us to move from a generality\nexpressed with Roman letters to a generality expressed with the\nconcavity, and Basic Law II (combined with generalized modus\nponens) allows us to move from a generality expressed with the\nconcavity to a generalization expressed with Roman letters, as of yet\nwe have no way to move from a proposition expressing a generality (of\neither sort) to an particular instance (the logic of\nBegriffsschrift contains no names, hence this lack was not a\nshortcoming in that earlier system). Frege rectifies this by\nintroducing what we shall call the Roman Letter Elimination\nrule (Frege calls this rule \u201cCiting Propositions\u201d), which\nhe describes as follows:\n\n\nWhen citing a proposition by its label, we may effect a simple\ninference by uniformly replacing a Roman letter within the proposition\nby the same proper name or the same Roman object-marker.\n\nLikewise, we may replace all occurrences in a proposition of a Roman\nfunction letter \u201c\\(f\\)\u201d, \u201c\\(g\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(h\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(F\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(G\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(H\\)\u201d\nby the same name or Roman\nmarker of a first-level function with one or two arguments, depending\non whether the Roman letter indicates a function with one or two\narguments.\n\nWhen we cite law (IIb), we may replace both occurrences of\n\u201c\\(M_\\beta\\)\u201d by the same name or Roman marker of a\nsecond-level function with one argument of the second kind.\n(1893/1903: \u00a748) \n\n\nRoman Letter Elimination allows for two sorts of application. The\nfirst, and simplest, involves uniformly replacing a particular Roman\nletter with a proper name. But the Roman letter elimination rule also\nallows us to replace a single Roman letter with a Roman object marker.\nHence, using this rule we can also obtain \u201c\n\n\\(\\Phi(\\)\n\n\\(y)\\)\u201d from \u201c\n\n\\(\\Phi(x)\\)\u201d by replacing the Roman letter \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d\nwith the Roman object marker\n\u201c\n\n\\(y\\)\u201d. Likewise, given a Grundgesetze\nproposition of the form  \u201c\n\n\\(f(\\Delta)\\)\u201d we can infer either \u201c\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d (by replacing the Roman letter \u201c\\(f\\)\u201d\nwith the function name \u201c\n\n\u201d or \u201c\n\n\\(g(\\)\n\n\\(\\Delta)\\)\u201d (by replacing the Roman letter \u201c\\(f\\)\u201d\nwith the Roman function marker\n\u201c\n\n\\(g\\)\n\n\u201d). One of the most visible and most important\napplications of the Roman letter elimination rule is when introducing\n\u201cinstances\u201d of axioms, since Frege does not require that\nwe write the axiom explicitly. Instead, we can cite any\n\u201cinstance\u201d of the axiom that results from applying the\nRoman letter elimination rule (one or more times) to the axiom\nitself.\n\nThere is no transition symbol for this inference, since it is applied\nwhen a previously derived formula is used as a premise in an\napplication of one of the other rules listed above.\n\nThis concludes our survey of the logical systems found in\nFrege\u2019s Begriffsschrift and Grundgesetze. But\nit is far from the conclusion of Frege\u2019s thinking on logic.\nAlthough Frege eventually abandoned his logicist project, and those\nparts of his logical system that led to the contradiction (Basic Laws\nV and VI, and the notion of value ranges more generally) in light of\nthe Russell paradox, he continued to teach courses on logic for many\nyears. The reader interested in Frege\u2019s later views should\nconsult the supplementary essay\n Frege\u2019s Logic After the Paradox.",
