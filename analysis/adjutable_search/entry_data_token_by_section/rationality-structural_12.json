    "main_text": "The Normative Significance of Structural Rationality || The Why-Be-Rational Challenge\n3.2 The Why-Be-Rational Challenge\n\nA second major difficulty for the view that there necessarily are\nreasons to conform to structural requirements is to come up with a\nsatisfying answer to the question \u201cWhy be rational?\u201d\n(Kolodny 2005) \u00ad\u2013 an answer that explicates what such\nreasons consist in and justifies the assumption that they\n exist.[8]\n It is worth noting that this challenge applies to requirements of\nstructural rationality in particular. At least if\nrequirements of substantive rationality are understood in terms of\nfacts about the balance of reasons, it makes no sense to ask what\nreasons we have to conform to such requirements: there is no need for\na reason to do what there is reason to do. But since structural\nrequirements are not to be understood in terms of facts about the\nbalance of reasons, it is a fair question why one should conform to\nthem.\n\nIt is natural to think that an answer to the why-be-rational challenge\nmust show how one can derive a reason to conform to structural\nrequirements from other reasons that exist independently of structural\nrationality. According to this derivative approach, there is\nreason to satisfy structural requirements because doing so is\nconducive to (or necessary for) \u2013 for example \u2013 being an\nagent (Korsgaard 2009), governing oneself (Bratman 2009b), doing what\nis objectively choiceworthy (Wedgwood 2017), or being interpretable by\nothers (Mildenberger 2019). Proposals of this form are subject to at\nleast one of two potential objections. One might question that\nstructural rationality is in fact necessarily conducive to (or\nnecessary for) the other relevant property, and one might question\nthat there necessarily is a reason to instantiate this other property\n(Kolodny 2005; Broome 2007b; Kiesewetter 2017; Brunero 2020). The\ncurrent state of the literature tends towards the verdict that none of\nthe existing proposals has been shown to be immune against both kinds\nof objections.\n\nPartly in response to problems for the derivative approach, some of\nthose who are sympathetic to the normativity of structural rationality\nhave opted for a non-derivative approach, according to which,\nfor any structurally irrational combination of attitudes, there is a\nsui generis \u201creason of [structural] rationality\u201d\nto avoid them, constituted by the very fact that the attitudes in\nquestion are prohibited by structural rationality (Southwood 2008; see\nalso Broome 2013; Hussain 2007 \u2013 see Other Internet Resources).\nThis move is often supported by way of an analogy with H.A.\nPrichard\u2019s influential response to the why-be-moral challenge,\nwhich essentially involved the rejection of the idea that morality\ncould be derivatively justified (Prichard 1912). Critics of the\nnon-derivative approach respond that it seems fetishistic to treat\nstructural rationality as something we have reason to aim at for\nits own sake (Kolodny 2005) and that the alleged normativity of\nstructural rationality lacks the kind of self-evident status that\nPrichard claims for the moral case and bases his view on (Brunero\n2020).\n\nBesides the objections that apply to the derivative and the\nnon-derivative approaches specifically, Kolodny (2005) also has raised\nan important general challenge for the assumption that there\nnecessarily is a reason to do what satisfies structural requirements.\nOn the most general level, the problem is that it is unclear what\ndeliberative relevance such a reason could have. Typically, we form\nattitudes on the basis of considerations connected to their\ncorrectness rather than their coherence with other\nattitudes. For example, we adopt beliefs because we think they are\nsupported by evidence rather than because they cohere with our other\nbeliefs. Indeed, it seems that because of their\ncorrectness-independence, coherence-based reasons for attitudes would\nbelong to the category of so-called \u201cwrong-kind\n reasons\u201d.[9]\n The existence of wrong-kind reasons is often denied (e.g. Kolodny\n2005; Way 2016), and even those who accept their existence typically\nagree that such reasons are irrelevant for the rationality of\nattitudes (Schroeder 2012). It would thus be very surprising if the\nnormativity of certain rational requirements depended on such reasons.\n(See Worsnip 2021: Ch. 8 for a recent defense of the view that the\nnormativity of structural rationality can be understood in terms of\nright-kind of reasons, and Daoust 2022 and Kiesewetter 2023\nfor criticism.)\n",
