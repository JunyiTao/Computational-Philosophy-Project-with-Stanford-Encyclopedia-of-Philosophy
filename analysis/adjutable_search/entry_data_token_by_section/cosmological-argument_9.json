    "main_text": "Argument from a Strong Principle of Sufficient Reason\n5. Argument from a Strong Principle of Sufficient Reason\n\nMichael Almeida (2018) builds on the critical arguments of van Inwagen\nand others regarding the PSR. He contends that the version of the PSR\nused by defenders of the cosmological argument is inadequate because\nit fails to provide the best explanation for the universe. The best\nexplanation, and hence the one required of a sound cosmological\nargument, is an absolute explanation, where everything is explained\ncompletely. There are no brute or contingent facts. He notes that in\nconstructing their respective cosmological arguments, Pruss and\nSwinburne reject absolute explanation for complete explanations, where\nthe effect is explained fully by the cause operating at a given time\nbut where no explanation of the cause at the time of the occurrence is\nrequired. According to him, traditional defenders of the cosmological\nargument cannot invoke the requirement of an absolute explanation\nbecause if they did, given their metaphysic of actualist realism, they\nwould incur a host of problems. Since all is determined on an absolute\nexplanation, they would face the problems of the impossibility of\nlibertarian free will, of indeterministic quantum effects, of modal\nimagination about lawless worlds where things pop into existence, and\nthe collapse of modal distinctions. These problems, he says, arise not\nfrom an absolutist PSR per se but from its conjunction with\nactualist realism (only the actual is real). \n\nThe way around this, he contends, if one is going to defend the\ncosmological argument, is to opt for a different ontology, namely,\ngenuine modal realism (mere possibilities are also real), which he\nclaims not only can legitimize the cosmological argument but avoids\nthe above problems. According to Almeida, modal realism makes\nlibertarian free will compatible with necessitarianism in that two\npossible worlds can have the same history H up to time\nt, but at t, A occurs in one world and not in\nanother world. The two histories do not determine whether A or\n-A occurs, but all possibilities necessarily occur. To make\nthis work Almeida fudges on the principle of the identity of\nindiscernibles. Although the two series H and H* up to\nt are identical, there is not one series H that forks at\nt. Rather, there are two series, such that at t A\ncan occur in one series and -A can occur in another. The past\ndoes not necessitate the future. Similarly, lawless or chaotic worlds,\ni.e., worlds lacking relations following a causal principle, are\npossible, so that it is possible and hence necessary that causeless\nevents occur. In such a world the cosmological argument would still\nhold, he claims, because the principle of sufficient reason,\ncompatible with the falsity of the causal principle, still holds. This\nanalysis, he thinks, frees the defender of the cosmological argument\nfrom problems that trouble traditional formulations. \n\nWe cannot digress here into modal realism (for discussion of possible\nworlds, see entries on\n Possible Worlds\n and\n David Lewis:\n Modal Metaphysics), but turn specifically to Almeida\u2019s\ncosmological argument. He argues that whereas cosmological arguments\nin the past commenced with an initial premise that was taken to\nexpress a contingent fact known a posteriori, \u201cfacts\nabout change, causation, contingency, and objective\u2026becoming\nare not usefully characterized as a posteriori facts\u201d (2018: 3).\nHe advances a cosmological argument with what he takes is an a\npriori fact: the pluriverse and everything in it, including all\nactualia and all possibilia, exist necessarily. This, he claims, is\nknowable a priori and according to the PSR requires an absolute\nexplanation. Part of his novel approach is his contention that every\nproposition in the argument expresses a necessary fact known a\npriori, and that a priori propositions also require an\nexplanation.\n\nSince Almeida does not advance a detailed version of the cosmological\nargument, we might attempt to reconstruct his view. \n\n\u201cPossible worlds are composite concrete\nobjects\u2026 [that] necessarily coexist\u201d (2018: 75).\nThis is a central contention of his Lewisian modal realism (75). \n The pluriverse exists as \u201cthe collection of all possible\nworlds\u201d (7,75). \n Everything that exists has an absolute explanation for its\nexistence. Strong PSR \n \u201cTherefore, there is an absolute explanation for the\npluriverse\u201d (75).\n An absolute explanation is possible \u201conly if there are no\ncontingent facts,\u201d that is, only if everything exists\nnecessarily (78\u201379).\n Therefore, there are no brute or contingent facts.\n This absolute explanation is found in the fact that God\nnecessarily exists (75,82). \n\n\nThe pluriverse is the necessary, creative manifestation of the\nnecessarily existing God (5). \n\nAlthough from necessary propositions contingent propositions cannot\nfollow, necessary propositions can follow. That is, from God\u2019s\nnecessary existence we can conclude that the pluriverse necessarily\nexists. This avoids the van Inwagen objection to the PSR as employed\nin the cosmological argument. Almeida holds that it also avoids the\nother problems associated with the cosmological argument in that it\nallows for contingency within absolute explanation. He contends that\ncontingency is protected by lowering the standards of similarity\nbetween worlds; that is, contingency is possible where we do not\nrequire exact identity between things held to exist in different\nworlds. He gives the example of his speaking Finnish, something he\ncannot do in the actual world. If someone who is identical to Almeida\nexists in another world, metaphysically he must have identical\nproperties. However, it makes sense to say that in another possible\nworld Almeida could speak Finnish and still be Almeida. We lower the\nstandards of similarity in our everyday consideration of existence in\nalternate worlds to allow for such possibilities and hence for the\ncontingency of his not speaking Finnish in the actual world.\n\nSeveral objections might be raised against this version of the\ncosmological argument. Perhaps most basic is the question why one\nwould accept modal realism. It is, as Almeida and others note,\n\u201contologically extravagant\u201d. Second, whereas necessity\ncharacterizes the metaphysical world, for Almeida contingency appears\nto be a subjective, epistemic contribution. That is, metaphysically,\neverything necessarily is what it is, has all its properties\nessentially, and is not something else. Epistemically, we can lower\nthe standards of similarity, so that two things with somewhat\ndiffering essential properties can be named the same, although\nstrictly or metaphysically speaking, they are not the same. Similarity\nis an epistemically expansive concept to allow for contingency, but it\ndoes not allow for metaphysical contingency. Third, he contends that\nthere are no brute facts on his theory. However, if there must be an\nabsolute explanation for everything, what is the explanation for\nGod\u2019s existence? He gives God as an absolute explanation for the\nnecessary existence of the pluriverse, but no absolute sufficient\nreason for God\u2019s existence. He might reply that God\u2019s\nexistence is explained by being metaphysically necessary. However, if\nthis explains God\u2019s existence, since every component of the\npluriverse and the pluriverse itself necessarily exist, why could not\ntheir metaphysical necessity be a sufficient reason or absolute\nexplanation for their existence? Could they, like God, simply be\nnecessary? \n",
