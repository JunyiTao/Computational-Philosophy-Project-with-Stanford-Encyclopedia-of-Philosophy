    "main_text": "The Reduction Thesis and Brentano\u2019s Logic Reform\n4. The Reduction Thesis and Brentano\u2019s Logic Reform\n\nSo far Brentano\u2019s theory seems to have a sound footing. Now we\nneed to make a big step when we consider Brentano\u2019s most radical\nthesis: what we called his reduction thesis (see\n section 1, claim 6):\n \u201cThe reducibility of categorical propositions, indeed the\nreducibility of all propositions which express a judgement, to\nexistential propositions is therefore indubitable\u201d (PES 218 [II\n60; SVS 1, 239). Before we can ask on what basis Brentano makes this\nclaim, we need to get clear about its meaning.\n\nBrentano introduces the notion of \u201creduction\u201d at a\nlinguistic level, applying it to sentences (or\n\u201cpropositions\u201d), but what he is aiming at is a reduction\nat the level of mental phenomena. At the linguistic level, the claim\nis that any categorical proposition can be transformed without change\nof meaning into an existential proposition. At the level of judgement,\nthe claim is that all judgements are in fact existential in character\n(and hence non-propositional). That shows for Brentano how language\ndisguises the true nature of our judgements. When somebody asserts,\nfor instance, that all S are P, he seems to\nmake a positive judgement about all S. In fact, however, his\njudgement is negative and of the form \u201cNo\nS-that-is-not-P exists\u201d. The point of the\nreduction thesis is to remove the linguistic disguise and to uncover\nthe true form of our judgements. It also ensures that the judgements\nexpressed by categorical and existential propositions are of the same\nkind. While such unification could also be achieved by saying that\nexistential propositions express categorical judgement,\nBrentano\u2019s thesis reverses that claim by declaring categorical\npropositions to express existential judgements.\n\nThat is the view that Brentano puts forth in the first edition of his\nPsychology (1874). However, Brentano had second thoughts on\nthis matter. While holding on to his view that existential\npropositions express categorical judgements, and that categorical\npropositions can express existential judgements, Brentano\nlater dropped the reduction thesis. At least since 1889, Brentano no\nlonger thought that categorical propositions only express\nexistential judgements. He states the result of this change of view in\nprint first in Vom Ursprung sittlicher Erkenntnis:\n\n\nThe judgement expressed in the sentence \u201cThe rose is a\nflower\u201d is composed out of two judgements of which one is the\nacknowledgement of the subject [\u2026] (OKRW fn. 22 [SVS 3,\n67f.])\n\n\nIt turns out that I make two judgements in one\u2014a \u201cdouble\njudgement\u201d\u2014when I seem to make only one: the judgement\nthat the rose is a flower. Furthermore, higher-order judgements about\nthe correctness and incorrectness of judgements exhibit the same\ncomplexity and come to play a prominent role in Brentano\u2019s\ntheory.\n\nThese new ideas complicate Brentano\u2019s theory and force one to\nrethink the entire project of reducing categorical propositions to\nexistential ones. We will do this in two steps. In this section, we\ntake a closer look at the reduction thesis in the context in which it\noriginally appears. In\n section 5\n we explain why Brentano gave up this project.\n\nWe already noted that Brentano\u2019s Psychology is not just\na book about mental phenomena. It also includes fundamental\nconsiderations pertaining to logic and epistemology. In that sense\nBrentano is no doubt a \u201cpsychologist\u201d. He takes judgements\nto be the primary bearers of truth, he defines logical inferences as\nrelations between judgements, and he considers validity to emerge from\nthe evidence of our judgements about such relations. In taking this\napproach, Brentano sets himself apart from the rising\n\u201cmathematical logic\u201d (see PES Appendix x). Instead of\napplying mathematical tools in logic, Brentano believed that logic\nwill advance better by applying the tools of descriptive psychology.\nTo prove his case, Brentano sketches a reform of traditional logic\nbased on his reduction thesis.\n\nTo begin with, Brentano challenges the logic contained in the\ntraditional square of opposition. This square is made up of the four\ncategorial propositions:\n\nA (\u201cAll S are P\u201d),\nE (\u201cNo S are P\u201d),\nI (\u201cSome S are P\u201d), and\nO (\u201cSome S are not P\u201d).\n\n\nAmong others, the following logical relations have been claimed to\nhold among these propositions (see Parsons 2017):\n\nA contradicts O, and vice versa.\nE contradicts I, and vice versa.\nA and E can be false but not true together (= law of\ncontrariety)\nI and O can be true but not false together (= law of\nsubcontrariety)\nA implies I (= subalternation)\nE implies O (= subalternation)\nI converts into \u201cSome P are S\u201d\n(simple conversion)\nE converts into \u201cNo P is S\u201d (simple\nconversion)\n\n\nBrentano rejects almost all these principles. After translating the\ncategorical propositions into existential form, he concludes that (i)\nand (ii) are the only rules correctly identified by traditional logic.\n(iii) to (vi) turn out to be mistaken if S is an empty term.\n(vii) and (viii) are correct principles, but no real conversion of a\njudgement takes place. The converted propositions simply express\none judgement in two ways. This is why Brentano says that his\ntheory\n\n\nleads to nothing less than a complete overthrow, and at the same time,\na reconstruction of elementary logic. Everything then becomes simpler,\nclearer, and more exact. (PES 230 [II 77; SVS 1, 251])\n\n\nThe core idea from which Brentano starts is very simple: traditional\nlogic takes the A-form and the I-form to express positive judgements,\nand the E-form and the O-form to express negative ones. According to\nBrentano, that is a confusion. All universal propositions (both A and\nE) express negative judgements and therefore lack existential import,\nwhereas all particular propositions (both I and O) express positive\njudgements with existential import. The reduction thesis fits in\nnicely with this idea, or so it seems. It helps us to correctly\ninterpret the principles of traditional logic and to see which of them\none should retain. In turn, the simplification of the square of\nopposition lends support to the reduction thesis. Everything seems to\nfit\n nicely.[23]\n\nBut a closer look reveals that this tight fit between Brentano\u2019s\ntheory of judgement and his reform of logic is illusory. With the\nadvance of quantificational logic, it became clear that in order to\ncorrect the square of oppositions in the way in which Brentano\nsuggests, all one needs to do is to use existentially quantified\nformulas instead of categorical propositions (see Church 1947: 56).\nThis observation contains both good and bad news for Brentano. The\ngood news is that Brentano\u2019s logical intuitions find support in\nquantificational logic. The bad news is that his reduction thesis\nceases to play a role in reforming logic. Surely, a quantified formula\nmay express an existential judgement with a non-propositional\ncontent, as Brentano conceived it, but it may also express a judgement\nwith a propositional content. To put it in other words:\nBrentano\u2019s revision of traditional logic can be replicated\nwithout making use of his reduction thesis.\n",
