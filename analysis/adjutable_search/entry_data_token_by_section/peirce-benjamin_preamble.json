    "main_text": "\n\n\nBenjamin Peirce  (b. April 4, 1809, d. October 6, 1880) was a professor\nat Harvard with interests in celestial mechanics, applications of plane\nand spherical trigonometry to navigation, number theory and algebra. In\nmechanics, he helped to establish the (effects of the) orbit of Neptune\n(in relation to Uranus). In number theory, he proved that there is no\nodd perfect number with fewer than four distinct prime factors. In\nalgebra, he published a comprehensive book on complex associative\nalgebras. Peirce is also of interest to philosophers because of his\nremarks about the nature and necessity of mathematics. \n",
