Varieties of Representationalism\n\nThe mere representation of redness does not suffice for\nsomething\u2019s looking red to a subject, much less for a sensory\nquality of red and still less for a phenomenal \u201csomething it is\nlike\u201d to experience that quality. One could say the word\n\u201cred\u201d aloud, or semaphore it from a cliff, or send it in\nMorse code, or write the French word \u201crouge\u201d on a\nblackboard, or point to a color chip. The representation must be\nspecifically a visual representation, produced by either a normal\nhuman visual system or by something functionally like one. Similar\npoints would be made for nonvisual qualities, such as subjective\nbitterness, which would require alluding to the gustatory system.\n\nThus, the representational theory of sensory qualities cannot be\npurely representational, but must appeal to some further factor, to\ndistinguish visual representations from other sorts of representations\nof redness. Dretske (1995) cites only the fact that visual\nrepresentation is sensory and what he calls \u201csystemic.\u201d\nTye (1995) requires that the representation be nonconceptual and\n\u201cpoised,\u201d though he also argues that visual\nrepresentations of color would differ from other sorts of\nrepresentations in being accompanied by further representational\ndifferences. Lycan (1996) appeals to functional role.\n",
