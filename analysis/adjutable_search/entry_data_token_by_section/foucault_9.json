    "main_text": "Major Works || Sex in the Ancient World\n4. Foucault after Foucault\n\nFoucault left instructions that there should be no posthumous\npublication of his writings that he had not published in his lifetime.\nBut Foucault had allowed taping of his lectures, and his estate\ndecided that this amounted to permission to publish edited versions of\nhis public lectures based on his notes and tape recordings. This\ndecision has allowed print editions of the annual courses of lectures\nthat he delivered at the Coll\u00e8ge de France from 1970\u201371\nthrough 1983\u201384 (except for a sabbatical year in 1976\u201377)\nas well as other lectures he gave in different universities around the\nworld. This has made an enormous body of important material available.\nSome of it covers work later published, but some presents ideas that\nappear nowhere else.\n\nThe lecture series Security, Territory, Population\n(1977\u20131978) and The Birth of Biopolitics\n(1978\u20131979) have been especially influential and introduce\nFoucault\u2019s ideas on government and\ngovernmentality. \u201cGovernment\u201d becomes\nFoucault\u2019s preferred term for power, while\n\u201cgovernmentality\u201d functions as his main theoretical tool\nfor analyzing its rationality, techniques, and procedures in the\nmodern world.\n\nFoucault shows that while government historically referred to a wide\nrange of practices, from religious guidance of the soul to ruling over\na territory and its inhabitants, in the context of the modern state it\nhas come to mean governing a population. Population as the object of\nmodern forms of government both required and encouraged the\ndevelopment of specific forms of knowledge such as statistical\nanalysis as well as macro-economic and bio-scientific knowledge. The\nmodern state had to take care of the life and the wellbeing of its\npopulation, and Foucault therefore calls the politics of the modern\nstate biopolitics.\n\nIn Foucault\u2019s original formulation, the term\n\u201cgovernmentality\u201d referred to the specific historical\ndevelopment of the essentially modern, complex techniques of power\nthat focused on the population. Later Foucault also gave the term a\nmore general meaning as \u201cthe way in which one conducts the\nconduct of men\u201d (The Birth of Biopolitics, [2008:\n186]). His key claim was that to understand the practice of government\nin this broad sense of controlling people\u2019s conduct, one had to\nstudy the specific technologies of power, but also the rationality\nunderpinning them. The practices and institutions of government are\nalways enabled, regulated, and justified by a specific form of\nreasoning or rationality that defines their ends and the suitable\nmeans of achieving them. To understand power as a set of relations, as\nFoucault repeatedly suggested, means understanding how such relations\nare reflected on and rationalized. It means examining how forms of\nrationality inscribe themselves in practices and systems of practices,\nand what role they play within them.\n\nThe exposition and analysis of the historically changing governmental\nrationalities was a pivotal goal of Foucault\u2019s lectures. His\nanalysis makes clear that modern governmental rationality has two\nmajor features. On the one hand, the development of the modern state\nis characterized by the centralization of political power: a\ncentralized state with highly organized administration and bureaucracy\nhas emerged. While this feature is commonly analyzed and also\ncriticized in political thought, Foucault also identifies the\nevolution of a second feature that appears to be antagonistic to this\ndevelopment. He claims that the modern state is also characterized by\nindividualizing power\u2014or \u201cpastoral power\u201d as he also\ncalls it. This is power that relies on individualizing knowledge about\na person\u2019 life. The modern state required the development of\npower technologies oriented towards individuals in an attempt to\ngovern their conduct in a continuous and permanent way. The result is\nthe intervention of the state in the everyday life of individuals for\nexample, their diet, mental health, and sexual practices.\n\nThe analysis of governmentality does not replace Foucault\u2019s\nearlier understanding of power. His method of analysis is similar to\nthe one he used to study the techniques and practices of power in the\ncontext of particular, local institutions such as the prison. What had\nto be analyzed, but also questioned, were the historically specific\nrationalities intrinsic to practices. At the same time,\nFoucault\u2019s analysis of governmentality adds new and important\ndimensions to his understanding of power. While his studies of\ndisciplinary power were restricted to specialized institutional\ncontexts, with the notion of government he was able to study larger,\nstrategic developments beyond the scope of his \u201cmicrophysics of\npower.\u201d He was able to transfer his understanding of power to\ndomains such as the state that were traditionally regarded as objects\nof political theory. With the idea of power as government, Foucault\nwas also able to clarify his understanding of resistance. Because\ngovernment refers to strategic, regulated and rationalized modes of\npower that have to be legitimized through forms of knowledge, the idea\nof critique as a form of resistance now becomes crucial. To govern is\nnot to physically determine the conduct of passive objects. Government\ninvolves offering reasons why those governed should do what they are\ntold, and this implies that they can also question these reasons.\nFoucault claims that this is why governmentality has historically\ndeveloped in tandem with the practice of political critique. The\npractice of critique must question the reasons for governing like\nthat: the legitimate principles, procedures and means of\ngoverning.\n\nIn the lecture series The Birth of Biopolitics, Foucault also\nengages in a lengthy examination of neoliberal governmentality. This\nanalysis has become seminal for contemporary political theory. Many\npolitical commentators now see the year 1979, when Foucault delivered\nhis lectures, as the inauguration of the dominance of neoliberal\neconomic policy in Europe and the United States. Almost forty years\nafter its expanding application, Foucault\u2019s topic and his\ninsights appear farsighted. His analysis of neoliberalism is\ndistinctive in at least two significant ways. First, he analyzes\nneoliberalism as a historically novel form of governmentality\u2014a\nrationality of governing connected with specific technologies of\npower. On Foucault\u2019s account neoliberalism is not understood\njust as an economic doctrine, but as a governmental form that is\ndirected toward specific objectives, regulates itself through\ncontinuous reflection, and, essentially, aims to ensure that\ncapitalism works. It also comprises a coherent political ontology, a\nset of philosophical background beliefs about the nature of society,\nmarkets, and human beings. However, it is not an ideology in the sense\nof consisting only of ideas or false beliefs. Its political ontology\nnecessitates and rationalizes a specific technology of\npower\u2014specific practices of governing, as well as a particular\nway of reflecting on and problematizing these practices.\n\nFoucault also emphasizes that neoliberal governmentality should be\nviewed as a particular way of producing subjects: it produces an\neconomic subject structured by specific tendencies, preferences, and\nmotivations. It aims to create social conditions that not only\nencourage and necessitate competitiveness and self-interest, but also\nproduce them. Foucault discusses the work of the American neoliberal\neconomists, in particular Gary Becker and his theory of human capital,\nin order to show how neoliberal subjects are understood as navigating\nthe social realm by constantly making rational choices based on\neconomic knowledge and the strict calculation of the necessary costs\nand desired benefits. Such subjects must make long-term and short-term\ninvestments in different aspects of their lives and acquire sufficient\neconomic knowledge to be able to calculate costs, risks, and possible\nreturns on the capital invested.\n\nFoucault never published any of the material developed in these two\nlecture series, and in the lectures in the 1980s he turned to examine\ntexts from ancient philosophy. Many of the ideas developed there were\nlater published as The Use of Pleasure and Care of the\nSelf. His studies of ancient sexuality, and, particularly, the\nidea of an aesthetics of existence also led him to the ancient idea of\nphilosophy as a way of life rather than a search for theoretical\ntruth. Although The Use of Pleasure has some discussion of\nPlato\u2019s conception of philosophy, Foucault\u2019s treatments of\nthe topic are primarily in lectures that he had no time to develop for\npublication. Some of these lectures discuss Socrates (in the\nApology and in Alcibiades I) as both a model and an\nexponent of a philosophical life focused on \u201ccare of the\nself\u201d and follow the subsequent ancient discussions of this\ntopic in, for example, Epictetus, Seneca, and Plutarch. Other lectures\ndeal with the ancient ideal of \u201ctruthful speaking\u201d\n(parrhesia), regarded as a central political and moral\nvirtue. Here Foucault discusses earlier formulations of the notion, in\nEuripides and Socrates, as well as its later transformations by the\nEpicureans, Stoics, and Cynics. This research project might have been\none of the most fruitful of all Foucault\u2019s engagements with\ntraditional philosophy. But his early death in 1984 prevented him from\ncompleting it.\n",
