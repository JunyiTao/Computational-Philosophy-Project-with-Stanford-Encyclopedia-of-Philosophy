    "main_text": "Without Possible Worlds || Subsistence vs. Existence\n3.1 Subsistence vs. Existence\n\nAlexius Meinong\u2019s theory of objects has had much influence on\nsome contemporary theorists, resulting in a variety of proposals.\nThese proposals are known broadly as Meinongian. According to Meinong,\na subject term in any true sentence stands for an object (Meinong\n1904). So the subject term in the sentence, \u2018The sixth right\nfinger of Julius Caesar is a finger\u2019, stands for an object,\nassuming that the sentence is true. (Such an assumption is strongly\ndisputed in Salmon 1987.) Even though the exact respects in which\ncontemporary Meinongian proposals are Meinongian and the extent of\ntheir Meinongianism differ from one proposal to another, all of them\ninherit this claim by Meinong in some form. They are thus united in\nresisting Bertrand Russell\u2019s criticism of Meinong, which\nmandates analyzing sentences containing a definite description, like\nthe one above concerning the sixth right finger of Julius Caesar, as\ngeneral statements rather than singular statements (Russell 1905); see\n3.1.2 for a particularly famous piece of Russell\u2019s criticism and\nhow two leading Meinongian theories handle it.\n\nMeinong distinguishes two ontological notions: subsistence and\nexistence. Subsistence is a broad ontological category, encompassing\nboth concrete objects and abstract objects. Concrete objects are said\nto exist and subsist. Abstract objects are said not to exist but to\nsubsist. The talk of abstract objects may be vaguely reminiscent of\nactualist representationism, which employs representations, which are\nactual abstract objects. At the same time, for Meinong, the nature of\nan object does not depend on its being actual. This seems to give\nobjects reality that is independent of actuality. Another interesting\nfeature of Meinong\u2019s theory is that it sanctions the postulation\nnot only of non-actual possible objects but also of impossible\nobjects, for it says that \u2018The round square is round\u2019 is a\ntrue sentence and therefore its subject term stands for an object.\nThis aspect of Meinong\u2019s theory has been widely pointed out, but\nnon-trivial treatment of impossibility is not confined to\nMeinongianism (Lycan & Shapiro 1986). For more on Meinong\u2019s\ntheory, see Chisholm 1960, Findlay 1963, Grossmann 1974, Lambert 1983,\nZalta 1988: sec.8. For some pioneering work in contemporary\nMeinongianism, see Casta\u00f1eda 1974, Rapaport 1978, Routley 1980.\nWe shall examine the theories of two leading Meinongians: Terence\nParsons and Edward Zalta. We shall take note of some other Meinongians\nlater in the section on fictional objects, as their focus is primarily\non fiction. Parsons and Zalta not only propose accounts of fictional\nobjects but offer comprehensive Meinongian theories of objects in\ngeneral.\n3.1.1 Theory of Non-Existent Objects\n\nQuine thought it curious that the ontological problem was so simple as\nto be put in three monosyllables: \u201cWhat is there?\u201d He\nfamously answered this simple question equally simply:\n\u201cEverything\u201d (Quine 1948). Parsons rejects Quine\u2019s\nclaim that every object exists, and asserts that some objects do not\nexist. Parsons proposes a theory of all objects, both existent and\nnon-existent (Parsons 1980). He uses the word \u2018actual\u2019 as\na synonym for \u2018existent\u2019, so he rejects (1), (2), and (3),\nbut accepts (4) and (5) as trivialities. It would be a mistake to\nclassify him as an actualist simply because he accepts (5). On the\ncontrary, he has much in common with possibilists in claiming that\nsome objects are not actual, that is, in denying (2). He, however,\nadmits only one sense of existence and claims that some objects do not\nexist in that sense. If this sole sense of existence corresponds to\nthe possibilist conception of existence relativized to any domain of\ndiscourse smaller than the largest available domain, then Parsons is\nin agreement with possibilists. But if it corresponds to the\npossibilist conception of existence relativized to the largest\navailable domain, then Parsons\u2019 ontology goes beyond that of\npossibilists. There is good evidence that the latter is the case, for\nParsons\u2019 ontology, as a typically Meinongian ontology, includes\nthe round square and other impossible objects, which the possibilist\nontology does not include. Lewis\u2019s discussion (Lewis 1990) of\nhow the non-Meinongian should understand \u201cnoneism\u201d, which\nis the view that some things do not exist, held by another Meinongian,\nRichard Routley (later Richard Sylvan), is helpful in this connection.\nFor differences between Routley\u2019s theory and Parsons\u2019, see\nParsons 1983. A sympathizer of Routley, Graham Priest, uses\ndialetheism (the thesis that some contradictions are true) and\nparaconsistent logic, along with the (possible- and impossible-)\nworlds framework, to bolster noneism (Priest 2005, 2016).\n\nParsons\u2019 theory is based on the Meinongian distinction between\nnuclear and extra-nuclear properties. Nuclear properties include all\nordinary properties, such as being blue, being tall, being kicked by\nSocrates, being a mountain, and so on. Extra-nuclear properties\ninclude ontological properties such as existence and being fictional,\nmodal properties such as being possible, intentional properties such\nas being thought of by Socrates, and technical properties such as\nbeing complete. See Parsons 1980: 24\u201327, 166\u201374 for more\non nuclear and extra-nuclear properties and a test for distinguishing\nbetween them. Parsons\u2019 theory can be encapsulated in the\nfollowing two principles:\n\n\n(P1) No two objects have exactly the same nuclear properties;\n\n(P2) For any set of nuclear properties, some object has all the\nnuclear properties in the set and no other nuclear properties.\n\n\nTake the set of nuclear properties, {being golden, being a mountain}.\nBy (P1) and (P2), some unique object has exactly the two nuclear\nproperties in the set. That object is the golden mountain. Take\nanother set of nuclear properties, {being square, being round}, and\nthe two principles give us the round square. Both of these objects are\nradically incomplete; they have no weight, height, shape, or size, for\nexample. The need for distinguishing nuclear properties from\nextra-nuclear properties is readily seen by considering the set,\n{being golden, being a mountain, being existent}. If (P2) is to apply\nto such a set, it should yield an object having the three properties\nin the set. Such an object is golden, a mountain, and existent, that\nis, it is a golden mountain which exists. So it should be true that a\ngolden mountain exists, but it is in fact not true. Parsons defines a\npossible object as an object such that it is possible that there exist\nan object having all of its nuclear properties. On this conception,\nall existing objects are possible objects, some golden mountains are\npossible objects, and the round square is not a possible object. It is\nworth noting that in Parsons\u2019 theory, negation needs to be\nhandled delicately (Parsons 1980: 19\u201320, 105\u201306, Zalta\n1988: 131\u201334). Take the set, {being round, being non-round}. By\n(P2), we have an object, x, which is round and non-round. So,\nx is non-round. If we can infer from this that it is not the\ncase that x is round, then we should be entitled to say that\nx is round and it is not the case that x is round,\nwhich is a contradiction. Thus, we should not be allowed to infer\n\u2018It is not the case that x is round\u2019 from\n\u2018x is non-round\u2019.\n\nIf Julius Caesar\u2019s entirely new right finger satisfying (a) and\n(b) is to be a Meinongian object of Parsons\u2019 theory, the best\ncandidate appears to be a non-existent incomplete object corresponding\nto the set of properties, {being a finger, belonging to Julius\nCaesar\u2019s right hand, being never burnt}. This set includes\nneither the property of being constituted by particles which do not\n(actually) exist nor the property of being possibly burnt. Both of\nthese properties are extra-nuclear properties, hence ineligible to be\nincluded in a set to which (P2) applies. So (P2) does not confer them\non the object corresponding to the set. How then does the object come\nto have the properties? It is not obvious how this question should be\nanswered (Parsons 1980: 21, note 4, where Parsons says, \u201cThe\npresent theory is very neutral about de re\nmodalities\u201d), but we should at least note that on\nParsons\u2019s theory, objects are allowed to have properties not\nincluded in their corresponding sets of nuclear properties: e.g., the\nround square, whose corresponding set only includes roundness and\nsquareness, has the property of being non-existent and the property of\nbeing incomplete. Also, Parsons allows nuclear properties which are\n\u201cwatered-down\u201d versions of extra-nuclear properties. So\nthe set may include the \u201cwatered-down\u201d versions of the two\nextra-nuclear properties in question and that may be enough. For more\non these and related issues in Parsons\u2019 theory, see Howell 1983,\nFine 1984.\n3.1.2 Theory of Encoding\n\nZalta\u2019s theory is based on the distinction made by\nMeinong\u2019s student, Ernst Mally, between two kinds of\npredication: exemplification and encoding (Mally 1912, Zalta 1983,\n1988). The idea is to maintain the Meinongian claim that the round\nsquare is a genuine object while avoiding contradicting oneself.\nRussell argues that since the round square is round and square, and\nsince if an object is square it is not the case that it is round, it\nfollows that the round square is such that both it is round and it is\nnot the case that it is round, which is a contradiction. Parsons\navoids the contradiction by refusing the inference from\n\u2018x is square\u2019 to \u2018it is not the case that\nx is round\u2019, where \u2018x\u2019 ranges over\nall objects. In contrast, Zalta accepts the inference for all objects\nand avoids the contradiction by refusing to interpret the predication,\n\u2018is round and square\u2019, of the round square as\nexemplification. He instead interprets it as encoding; the round\nsquare encodes roundness and squareness. Encoding squareness is not\nincompatible with encoding roundness, even though exemplifying\nsquareness is incompatible with exemplifying roundness. Predication as\nunderstood as encoding follows a different logic from predication as\nunderstood as exemplification. The crux of Zalta\u2019s theory is\nencapsulated in the following two principles:\n\n\n(Z1) Objects which could sometimes have a spatial location do not, and\ncannot, encode properties;\n\n(Z2) For any condition on properties, some object that could never\nhave a spatial location encodes exactly those properties which satisfy\nthe condition.\n\n\nSome object is the round square, for, by (Z2), among objects which\ncould never have a spatial location is an object which encodes\nroundness and squareness. The noun phrase, \u2018the round\nsquare\u2019, unambiguously denotes such a necessarily non-spatial\nobject. Other noun phrases of the same kind include those which denote\nnumbers, sets, Platonic forms, and so on. There are, however, many\nnoun phrases which are ambiguous. They allow an interpretation under\nwhich they denote an object that is necessarily non-spatial, and also\nallow an interpretation under which they denote an object that is\npossibly spatial and possibly non-spatial. The phrase, \u2018the\ngolden mountain\u2019, is an example. The golden mountain in one\nsense is an object which is necessarily non-spatial and which encodes\ngoldenness and mountainhood. The golden mountain in the other sense is\nan object which actually is non-spatial but could be spatial. When we\nsay that the golden mountain in the second sense is golden, it means\nthat necessarily if the golden mountain is spatial, it is golden.\nSince, by (Z1), such an object cannot encode properties, all\npredications in the preceding sentence have to be understood as\nexemplification. Similarly with Julius Caesar\u2019s entirely new\nfinger satisfying (a) and (b).\n\nZalta endorses the claim that some objects are non-actual possible\nobjects, so he appears to side with possibilists. But he defines a\nnon-actual possible object as an object which could have a spatial\nlocation but does not (Zalta 1988: 67). So the claim means for Zalta\nthat some objects could have a spatial location but do not. This is\ncompatible with actualism, provided that all such objects are actual\nin the sense of actually existing (Linsky & Zalta 1994, also\nWilliamson 1998, 2002, 2013; it is noteworthy that Timothy Williamson\nindependently argues for what he calls necessitism, which\nsays [in a nutshell] that every possible object is a necessary\nobject). If we understand Zalta\u2019s theory this way, we have the\nfollowing actualist picture: all objects are actual and existing, some\nobjects are necessarily non-spatial, and other objects are possibly\nspatial and possibly non-spatial. (For an alternative interpretation\nof Zalta\u2019s formal theory, according to which some objects do not\nexist, see Zalta 1983: 50\u201352, 1988: 102\u201304, Linsky &\nZalta 1996: note 8.) Among the latter type of objects are those which\nare actually spatial but possibly not, like you and me, and those\nwhich are possibly spatial but actually not, like the golden mountain\nin the appropriate sense. The distinction between the golden mountain\nin this (exemplification) sense and the golden mountain in the other\n(encoding) sense is key to overcoming some objections (Linsky &\nZalta 1996). See Bennett 2006 for the claim that the Linsky-Zalta view\nis not actualist, and Nelson & Zalta 2009 for a response. Hayaki\n2006 critiques both Linsky-Zalta and Williamson.\n\nIf we confine our attention to necessarily non-spatial objects, a\ndefinition of a possible object which corresponds to Parsons\u2019\ndefinition is easily available to Zalta: a possible (necessarily\nnon-spatial) object is a (necessarily non-spatial) object such that\nsome object could exemplify exactly the properties it encodes. In this\nsense, some object which encodes goldenness and mountainhood, among\nother properties, is a possible object but the object which encodes\nsquareness and roundness is not. Julius Caesar\u2019s entirely new\nfinger satisfying (a) and (b) can be treated in the same way as the\ngolden mountain. Complications similar to those which arise for\nParsons\u2019 theory do not arise for Zalta\u2019s theory, for all\nproperties are equally subject to encoding, including those properties\nParsons regards as extra-nuclear. For a comparison of the\ntwo-kinds-of-property approach and the two-kinds-of-predication\napproach, see Rapaport 1985.\n4. Unicorns\n\nIf anything is a non-actual possible object, a unicorn is. Or so it\nappears. But Kripke vigorously argues against such a view in the 1980\nversion of Kripke 1972: 24, 156\u201358. His argument starts with the\nassumption that the unicorn is (intended to be) an animal species if\nanything. This excludes the possibility that a horse with a horn\nartificially attached to its forehead is a unicorn. Kripke assumes\nobviously that there are actually no unicorns and that unicorns are\npurely mythical creatures. Also assumed is the absence in the relevant\nmyth of any specification of the genetic structure, evolutionary\nhistory, or other potentially defining essential features of the\nunicorn. (Possession of a horn is not a defining essential feature of\nthe unicorn any more than having tawny stripes is a defining feature\nof the tiger.) The myth describes the unicorn only in stereotypical\nterms: looking like a horse, having a horn protruding from its\nforehead, etc. Suppose that there are objects with all such\nstereotypical features of the unicorn. This seems perfectly possible\nand Kripke accepts such a possibility. But he rejects its sufficiency\nfor establishing the possibility of unicorns. Suppose that among the\nobjects with the stereotypical unicorn features, some have a genetic\nmakeup, an evolutionary history, or some other potentially defining\nessential unicorn characteristic which is radically different from the\ncorresponding characteristic had by the others with the same\nstereotypical unicorn features. Which ones among those with the\nstereotypical unicorn features would then be real unicorns and which\nones fool\u2019s unicorns (\u00e0 la fool\u2019s gold)?\nThere is no fact of the matter. Given that the unicorn is an animal\nspecies, not everything that looks and behaves like a unicorn is\nguaranteed to be a unicorn. To be a unicorn, an object has to possess\nthe defining essential characteristics of the unicorn. But there are\nno defining characteristics of the unicorn; the myth does not specify\nthem, and the universe does not instantiate them. This surprising\nargument has convinced many philosophers of the impossibility of\nunicorns, but others have raised doubt by arguing that the notion of a\nbiological kind, such as a species, is far more malleable than Kripke\nassumes (Dupr\u00e9 1993).\n\nThe line of argument Kripke uses, if successful, is applicable to all\nnon-actual natural kinds and their analogs (except for natural-kind\nanalogs of Kaplan\u2019s automobile or Salmon\u2019s Noman). It is\nunclear that it or something like it is successfully applicable to\nindividuals like Vulcan, but if it is, then we must say that such\nindividuals are impossible objects. Some theorists liken Vulcan to\nfictional objects, as we will see in the next section, and some\ntheorists argue that fictional objects are impossible objects (Kaplan\n1973, 1980 version of Kripke 1972: 157\u201358, Fine 1984:\n126\u201328, Yagisawa 2010: 271\u201377). If Vulcan is an impossible\nobject, the problem of uniquely specifying Vulcan, as opposed to\nNacluv, becomes less urgent, for it is not evident that we should be\nable to specify an impossible object uniquely and non-trivially.\n5. Fictional Objects\n\nLet us shift our attention from mythological creatures to fictional\nobjects. Fictional objects include fictional characters but not all\nfictional objects are fictional characters. Sherlock Holmes is a\nfictional object and a fictional character. His liver is a fictional\nobject but not a fictional character. It may be tempting to think that\nfictional objects are non-actual possible objects, even though it is\nobvious that not all non-actual possible objects are fictional\nobjects.\n\nThere are two main problems with the claim that fictional objects are\npossible objects. One is the problem of impossible fictional objects.\nSome fictional objects are ascribed incompatible properties in their\nhome fiction by their original author (usually inadvertently). This\nseems to be sufficient for them to have those properties according to\ntheir home fiction, for what the author says in the fiction\n(inadvertently or not) seems to hold the highest authority on truth in\nthat fiction. On the assumption that a fictional object has a given\nproperty if it has that property according to its home fiction, those\nfictional objects are impossible objects, for no possible object has\nincompatible properties. The other problem is the failure of\nuniqueness. It may be viewed as the problem of meeting the Quinean\ndemand for clear identity conditions. Holmes is a particular fictional\nobject. So if we are to identify Holmes with a possible object, we\nshould identify Holmes with a particular possible object. But there\nare many particular possible objects that are equally suited for the\nidentification with Holmes. One of them has n-many hairs,\nwhereas another has (n+1)-many hairs. No fictional story\nabout a particular fictional object written or told by a human being\nis detailed enough to exclude all possible objects but one to be\nidentified with that fictional object, unless it is a fiction about an\nactual object or a non-actual possible object analogous to\nKaplan\u2019s automobile or Salmon\u2019s Noman.\n\nStrangely enough, there is also a problem with the claim that\nfictional objects are non-actual objects. That is, there is some\nplausible consideration in support of the claim that fictional objects\nare actual objects. We make various assertions about fictional objects\noutside the stories in which they occur and some of them are true: for\nexample, that Sherlock Holmes is admired by many readers of the Holmes\nstories. The simplest and most systematic explanation appears to be to\npostulate Holmes as an actual object possessing the properties such\ntrue assertions ascribe to him. Fictional objects may then be said to\nbe theoretical objects of literary criticism as much as electrons are\ntheoretical objects of physics. This type of view enjoys surprisingly\nwide acceptance. (Searle 1974, van Inwagen 1977, 1983, Fine 1982,\nSalmon 1998, Thomasson 1999). The theorists in this camp, except van\nInwagen (van Inwagen 2003: 153\u201355), also think that fictional\nobjects are brought into existence by their authors as actual objects.\nEven if this type of view is to be followed, it must still be denied\nthat Holmes is actually a detective, for if we enumerate all\nindividuals who are actually detectives, Holmes will not be among\nthem. By the same token, Holmes is not actually a resident of Baker\nStreet or even a human being. Though actual, Holmes is actually hardly\nany of those things Conan Doyle\u2019s stories describe him as being.\nHolmes must not be a concrete object at all but instead an abstract\nobject which has the property of being a detective according to\nDoyle\u2019s stories, the property of being a resident of Baker\nStreet according to Doyle\u2019s stories, and so on.\n\nMeinongian theories overcome the problems of impossibility and\nnon-uniqueness in a straightforward way. According to Parsons\u2019\ntheory, a fictional object x which originates in a certain\nstory is the object that has exactly the nuclear properties F\nsuch that according to the story, Fx (Parsons 1980:\n49\u201360, 228\u201323). A fictional object to which the story\nascribes incompatible properties is simply an impossible object, but\nsuch an object is harmless because it does not exist. As for the\nproblem of non-uniqueness, Sherlock Holmes is not identified as a\ncomplete object. Instead Holmes is said to be the object having just\nthe nuclear properties Holmes has according to the stories. There is\nno number n such that Holmes has exactly n-many\nhairs according to the stories. So Parsons\u2019 Holmes does not have\nn-many hairs, for any n. It is an incomplete\nobject.\n\nZalta offers a similar picture of fictional objects which is subsumed\nunder his general theory of encoding. According to him, a fictional\nobject x which originates in a certain story is the object\nthat encodes exactly the properties F such that according to\nthe story, Fx (Zalta 1988: 123\u201329). Zalta\u2019s\ntreatment of the problem of impossibility is similar to\nParsons\u2019. A fictional object to which the story ascribes\nincompatible properties is an object which encodes those properties,\namong others. Such an object is harmless because it does not exemplify\nthe incompatible properties. Zalta\u2019s solution to the problem of\nnon-uniqueness is equally similar to Parsons\u2019. Sherlock Holmes,\nfor Zalta, is simply an incomplete object which does not encode the\nproperty of having exactly n-many hairs, for any\nn.\n\nThough not meant to be a fictional object, Vulcan may be given the\nsame treatment as explicitly fictional objects. According to Parsons,\nthe word \u2018Vulcan\u2019 is ambiguous. In one sense, it is the\nname of a fictional object which originates in a false astronomical\nstory. In the other sense, it does not refer to anything. Zalta does\nnot recognize Parsons\u2019 second sense and simply regards\n\u2018Vulcan\u2019 as the name of a fictional object.\n\nFor another Meinongian approach to fictional objects, see\nCasta\u00f1eda 1979. Charles Crittenden offers a view in a\nMeinongian spirit but with a later-Wittgensteinian twist (Crittenden\n1991). Like Parsons, Crittenden maintains that some objects do not\nexist and that fictional objects are such objects. Following later\nWittgenstein, however, he sees no need to go beyond describing the\n\u201clanguage game\u201d we play in our fictional discourse and\ndismisses all metaphysical theorizing. Robert Howell criticizes\nParsons\u2019 theory, among others, and recommends an approach which\nconstrues fictional objects as non-actual objects in fictional worlds,\nwhere fictional worlds include not just possible but impossible worlds\n(Howell 1979). Nicholas Wolterstorff argues for the view that\nfictional objects are kinds (Wolterstorff 1980). For criticism of this\nview, see Walton 1983. Van Inwagen 2003 contains useful compact\ndiscussions of some Meinongian and non-Meinongian theories of\nfictional objects.\n\nGregory Currie denies that fictional names like \u2018Sherlock\nHolmes\u2019 are proper names or even singular terms (Currie 1990).\nHe claims that sentences of fiction in which \u2018Sherlock\nHolmes\u2019 occurs should be regarded as jointly forming a long\nconjunction in which every occurrence of \u2018Sherlock Holmes\u2019\nis replaced with a variable bound by an initial existential quantifier\nin the way suggested by Frank Ramsey (Ramsey 1931).\n\nKendall Walton urges that we should take seriously the element of\nmake-believe, or pretense, inherent in the telling of a fictional\nstory by the author and the listening to it by the audience (Walton\n1990, also Evans 1982: 353\u201368, Kripke 2013). According to this\npretense theory, the pretense involved in the language game of\nfictional discourse shields the whole language game from a separate\nlanguage game aimed at non-fictional reality, and it is in the latter\nlanguage game that we seek theories of objects of various kinds as\nreal objects. If this is right, any search for the real ontological\nstatus of fictional objects appears to be misguided. For the view that\nthe pretense theory is compatible with a theory of fictional objects\nas real objects, see Zalta 2000.\n6. Quantified Modal Logic\n\nOne important theoretical use of non-actual possible objects is to\nbolster the most straightforward quantified modal logic (Scott 1970,\nParsons 1995). If we add a modal sentential operator meaning \u201cit\nis possible that\u201d or \u201cit is necessary that\u201d to\nclassical first-order quantificational logic, along with appropriate\naxioms and an appropriate rule of inference catering to the added\noperator, the resulting system yields a sentence meaning the following\nas a theorem:\n\nIf it is possible that something is F, then something is such\nthat it is possible that it is F.\n\nThe formal logical sentence with this meaning is known as the\nBarcan Formula, after Ruth C. Barcan, who published the first\nsystematic treatment of quantified modal logic, in which she\npostulated the formula as an axiom (Barcan 1946), and who has\npublished under the name \u2018Ruth Barcan Marcus\u2019 since 1950.\nIf we read \u2018F\u2019 as meaning \u201cnon-identical\nwith every actual object\u201d, the Barcan Formula says that if it is\npossible that something is non-identical with every actual object,\nthen something x is such that it is possible that x\nis non-identical with every actual object. The antecedent is plausibly\ntrue, for there could have been more objects than the actual ones. But\nif so, the consequent is true as well, assuming the truth of the\nBarcan Formula. But no actual object is non-identical with every\nactual object, for every actual object is identical with itself, an\nactual object. Assuming the necessity of identity, if an object\ny is identical with an object z, it is not possible\nthat y is non-identical with z. So, no actual object\nis such that it is possible that it is non-identical with every actual\nobject. Therefore, any object x such that it is possible that\nx is non-identical with every actual object must be a\nnon-actual possible object.\n\nThe converse of the Barcan Formula is also a theorem along with the\nBarcan Formula in classical logic augmented with a possibility or\nnecessity operator, and is as interesting. The Converse Barcan\nFormula, as it is known, says the following:\n\nIf something is such that it is possible that it is F, then\nit is possible that something is F.\n\nThe ontology of non-actual possible objects is an integral part of the\npossibilist view that quantifiers in quantified modal logic range over\nall possible objects, non-actual as well as actual. This possibilist\nview validates the Converse Barcan Formula. If we read\n\u2018F\u2019 as meaning \u201cdoes not exist\u201d, the\nConverse Barcan Formula says that if something x is such that\nit is possible that x does not exist, then it is possible\nthat something does not exist. The antecedent is plausibly true, for\nany one of us, actual people, could have failed to exist. But if so,\nthe consequent is true as well, assuming the truth of the Converse\nBarcan Formula. But on actualist representationism, no possible world\ncontains a representation which says that something does not exist,\nfor it is contradictory provided that \u2018something\u2019 means\n\u201csome existing thing\u201d. So if the consequent is to be true\non actualist representationism, \u2018something\u2019 should not\nmean \u201csome existing thing\u201d but rather should mean\n\u201csome thing, irrespective of whether it exists\u201d. That is,\nthe existential quantifier in the consequent needs to have a free\nrange independently of the possibility operator in whose scope it\noccurs, which is hard to fathom on actualist representationism but\nwhich the possibilist view allows. The consequent does not even appear\nto be threatened with contradiction if we assume the possibilist view\nand let the existential quantifier range over all possible objects,\nincluding non-actual ones.\n\nIn classical logic, the domain for quantification is assumed to be\nnon-empty and every individual constant is assumed to refer to\nsomething in the domain. In free logic, neither of these\nassumptions is made. Thus free logic appears to be particularly suited\nto theorizing about non-existent objects; see Lambert 1991, Jacquette\n1996. For a criticism of the free-logical approach to fictional\ndiscourse, see Woods 1974: 68\u201391. Interestingly, the Barcan\nFormula and the Converse Barcan Formula are not derivable in free\nlogic.\n\nMarcus herself proposes the substitutional reading of quantification\nto skirt the need for non-actual possible objects (Marcus 1976), and\nlater suggests combining it with objectual quantification over actual\nobjects (Marcus 1985/86).\n\nWilliamson 2013 contains a detailed and useful discussion of the\nBarcan Formula and the Converse Barcan Formula.\n\nWilliamson 2013 also proposes that we should replace the\npossibilism-actualism distinction in favor of the distinction between\nnecessitism (necessarily everything is necessarily something) and\ncontingentism, which is the negation of necessitism. Necessitism\nentails that everything necessarily exists. Possibilism holds that\nsome things are contingent existents, like you and me. Intuitively\ncontingentism seems correct; it seems that you and I fail to exist at\nsome possible worlds. But according to necessitism, such worlds are\nworlds where you and I do not exist as concrete objects but do exist\nas abstract objects. Williamson defends his proposal by arguing that\nthe possibilism-actualism distinction is a distinction between a\nlogical falsity and a logical triviality and that it neglects\nimpossibilia. Menzel 2020 gives a critical examination of\nWilliamson\u2019s proposal. Also see Cameron 2016.",
