    "main_text": "Causal Models\n9. Causal Models\n\nIt has been noted that \u201c[p]erhaps the greatest difference\nbetween a contemporary concept of causation and a seventeenth century\nconcept is one of model. Following in Hume\u2019s footsteps,\ncontemporary philosophers customarily conceive causation as a relation\nbetween events (e.g., my flipping the switch caused the light to come\non) while seventeenth century philosophers thought of it more as a\nrelation among substances, their qualities, and their\n\u2018powers\u2019 (e.g., I cause my idea of justice)\u201d\n(Frankel, 57).\n\nYet this early model of causation possesses at least one virtue that\nthe contemporary one does not. It has the distinct advantage of\navoiding any problematic regress of causal explanation. Once a causal\nsequence of events is laid out, we can always ask why that sequence,\nand not another, occurred. But an explanation of this sequence,\naccording to an event/event model of causation does not preclude the\nsame question \u201cWhy that sequence of events?\u201d being asked\nof it again and again. On the other hand, Leibniz does not think that\nthe power or will, which are not events at all, but faculties, of an\nagency or agent, need any explaining. The regress of explanation stops\nabruptly with the substance. In a letter to De Volder (June 30, 1704),\nhe writes: \u201cTo \u2026 ask why there is perception and appetite\nin simple substances is to inquire about something ultramundane, so to\nspeak, and to demand reasons of God why he has willed things to be\nsuch as we conceive them to be\u201d (GP ii, 271/L 538). Furthermore,\nthe central message of Leibniz\u2019s essay, Against Barbaric\nPhysics (c. 1713), seems to be that since the actions of\nsubstances are in fact spontaneous, there is no way of explaining\nchange in monads unless we posit some force or power that drives\nsubstantial action. If it turns out that substances just are forces or\npowers, as Julia Jorati and John Whipple maintain, it is no violation\nof this causal model. At any rate, without this agency in monads,\nthere would be no cause sufficient to determine the whole sequence of\nevents and thus no adequate causal explanation of the totality of\nactions (i.e., perceptions) on the part of substances. And, besides\nfailing to break out of the cycle of explanation that appears to\nplague event/event models of causation, such a picture appears to\nviolate Leibniz\u2019s Principle of Sufficient Reason:\n\nThus the sufficient reason, which needs no other reason, must be\noutside this series of contingent things, and must be found in a\nsubstance which is its cause, and which is a necessary being, carrying\nthe reason of its existence with itself. Otherwise, we would not yet\nhave a sufficient reason where one could end the series.\n(Principles of Nature and Grace \u00a78 GP vi, 604/AG 210)\n\n\nHence, we should understand Leibniz\u2019s statement in a letter to\nArnauld (May 1686) that \u201cthere is always something to be\nconceived in the subject which provides the explanation why this\npredicate or this event belongs to it, or why a particular event\nhappened rather than not\u201d (GP ii, 45/PM 60) not in terms of some\nideal event contained in the subject as carrying the correlative\nexplanatory role, but the power or principle of change of the\nsubject.\n\nFurther lending credence to the claim that Leibniz postulates a\nsubstance-accident model of causation, it appears that whenever\nLeibniz describes the causal relation found within substances, even\nthose depictions that are best understood as metaphorical, those\ndepictions themselves point to a non-homogeneous account of the\nintrasubstantial causal relata. That is, intrasubstantial causal\nrelata do not involve components of the same kinds. Whether he speaks\nof the actualizations of an essence, predicates of a subject, values\nof a function, perceptions of an appetite, cogitations of a will, ends\nof reason, harmonies of a rule of order, it is clear that Leibniz\nenvisions \u201ceffects\u201d which are different in kind from their\n\u201ccauses.\u201d The essence of a substance is not itself an\nactualization; the function of a substance is not itself a value of a\nfunction (Cover & O\u2019Leary-Hawthorne, 229); a\nsubstance\u2019s appetite is not itself a perception; the will of a\nsubstance is not itself a cogitation, it is a faculty; the reason\ngoverning the substance is not itself the end to which it strives;\nand, the rule of order is not itself an instance of the harmonious\nagreement among substances.\n\nAll told, it seems that Leibniz ascribes to a heterogeneous account of\ncausation, where the cause is different in kind from its effect.\nUltimately, Leibniz offers a theory of intrasubstantial causation that\nincorporates both efficient, final causes, and formal causes, where\nonly substances\u2014or better yet, their powers\u2014can be\nefficient causes and perceptions have a teleological as well as a\nformal function.\n\nTaking substances as paradigmatic causes may help us to better\nappreciate Leibniz\u2019s compatibilist account of freedom. Except\nfor divine activity, all genuine causation takes place\nintrasubstantially\u2014that is, within a substance.\nSubstances are the causes of their future states and determine those\neffects. However, knowing that a substance\u2019s future states flow\nwith certainty from prior states due its own inherent powers does not\nautomatically entail that all of its states are absolutely\nessential to it. That I must write this entry on\nLeibniz\u2014given my initial states, it was certain or determined\nfor me to write it\u2014does not entail that it is part of my\nessence, my very identity, to write this entry. Leibniz wants to\nmaintain that I could have acted otherwise. And thus I freely wrote\nit, even though it was certain that I did so. \n",
