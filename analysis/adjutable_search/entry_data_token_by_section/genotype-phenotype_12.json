    "main_text": "Control and Reintegration || Experimental Genetics\n5.1 Experimental Genetics\n5.1.1 Inbred Lines\n\nFor inbred lines, in contrast to the realm of natural varying\npopulations, the phenotype-as-class is not used to identify the\ngenotype-as-class; indeed it is recognized as a phenotype because the\ngenotype, which is the inbred line, is given. As far as\nJohannsen\u2019s experiments could discern, the\ngenotype-as-material-constituents could be the whole germ cell or\nseed. Reintegration would entail conceptualizing the action of these\nconstituents of the genotype-as-whole-cell and finding methods to\ninvestigate their influence on the development over time of the\norganism\u2019s traits (see entry on\n developmental biology).\n Such a program had proponents, especially in the first half of the\ntwentieth century, but came to be eclipsed by Mendelian genetics and\ndiscounted by historians and philosophers of heredity (Sapp 1987).\n5.1.2 Mendelian Crosses\n\nMendelian experiments require further control than for inbred lines,\nbecause the lines have to be raised in uniform conditions, crossed,\nand self-pollinated. Phenotypes can then be used to discriminate among\nmultiple hypotheses about genotypes, where the phenotype is a class of\norganisms that share only some part of the whole set of the\norganisms\u2019 traits and the genotype is a class or organisms that\nhave some part of their germ cells in common. The relevant part of the\ngenotype was shown to be pairs of genes located along chromosomes as\nlong as, given the control entailed by Mendelian experiments, the\nfocus lay on differences in traits, not on how an offspring\ndevelops to have the trait at all. Recall, as Johannsen noted, that\nMendelian experiments are limited in examining the species-typical\naspects of the germ cells and subsequent development. Again, a program\nfor reintegrating what is abstracted away through experimental control\ncan be imagined: researchers identify the material constituents of the\ngenotype and then trace how all these constituents influence the\ndevelopment over time of the species-typical traits. From the\ncomposite of these influences the organism as a structured whole might\nemerge. Two emerging features of the study of heredity, however, work\nagainst such a reintegration program: Heredity, as mentioned earlier,\nhas become equated with the transmission of and cross-generational\npatterns in the differences. That means development became a separate\nand secondary matter (Sapp 1987); analysis of the dynamics of\nspecies-typical development of morphological structure was eclipsed by\ngenetics.\n\nIt is not strictly correct to assert that Mendelian experiments are\nunable to examine species-typical traits. For example, all individuals\nof all species of the fruit-fly genus Drosophila have exactly three\nsimple light receptors, ocelli, arranged in a symmetrical\ntriangle on the midline of the top of their heads. The simplest\nassumption is that there is no variation in genotypes (in the sense of\nmaterial constituents) that influence this trait and its development\nis resistant to normal environmental disturbance. However, if the\ndevelopment of the fly is sufficiently disturbed, some flies with two\nor fewer ocelli are observed. If those with fewer than three ocelli\nare used as parents for the next generation, they produced more\nabnormal flies than the parental generation. When the process of\nselective breeding from abnormal flies is continued over many\ngenerations, a line of flies is produced that consistently has two\nocelli, even in the absence of any external disturbance of development\n(Maynard Smith & Sondhi 1960). The success of this and other\nselection experiments in the same vein shows that the original\nuniformity of the trait is not an indication that there is uniformity\nin all of the genotypes that may, under certain conditions, influence\nthe trait\u2019s development (Rendel 1967). Any investigation of how\nthe diverse genotypes result in the development of the typical\nthree-ocelli pattern now has to explain the occurrence of the aberrant\npattern as well.\n\nAlthough Johannsen (1911) gave almost no attention to the dynamics of\ndevelopment, recall (from\n section 2)\n that he wanted the genotype to be seen as a whole and saw no value in\nthe idea that \u201cdiscrete particles of the chromosomes are\n\u2018bearers\u2019 of special parts of the whole inheritance in\nquestion\u201d (1911: 131\u20132). Yet, Mendelian experiments seemed\nto show that the discrete-particles idea was justified. \n5.1.3 Molecular Genetics\n\nMuch progress in restoring what was abstracted away has come through\nthe productive research program of molecular genetics (as summarized\nat the end of\n section 3).\n This is not to say that any catalog or database of genes and DNA\nvariants for any organism remotely resembles a literal\n\u201cblueprint\u201d or \u201cprogram\u201d for its\ndevelopment. Nevertheless, with ever-improving knowledge\nabout genetics at the molecular level and technologies to manipulate\nDNA, the field of genetics is now involved, not only in accounting for\nhow one organism differs in a trait from another, but also in\nilluminating the networks of gene activity and feedback (gene\nregulation) and the major branch-points of development of the\norganized structures\u2014biochemical, physiological, and behavioral,\nas well as morphological\u2014which phenotypes-as-traits are variants\nof. Whether this progress eventually leads to an account of the\noperation of the genotype as a whole (or even of some delimited parts\nof the genotype), and then to the species-typical development of\nstructure, remains to be seen (Robert 2004, entry on\n developmental biology).\n The need for such reintegration is, however, often discounted. This\nis evident when, for example, it is assumed that genes descended from\na common ancestor (orthologs) should have the same function\nand influence the same traits across taxonomic groups descended from\nthat ancestor (e.g., PAX6 gene in relation to the eyes of mammals and\nfruit flies). What that assumption overlooks is the possibility that\ntraits depend on the genotype as a whole in the development of the\norganism as a whole and the possibility that a gene may be conserved\nthrough roles that shift in the evolving lineages.\n\nNotwithstanding the advances of molecular genetics, its methods\ninvolve another significant form of control. The uniform conditions\ntypical in molecular genetics exclude dynamics of development in\necological context, a context, moreover, that the organism, with its\ntraits, helps shape (Gilbert & Epel 2009; Lewontin 1983). It could\nbe imagined that genetic investigations of the hereditary basis of\ntraits\u2014or, at least, of differences among\ntraits\u2014for inbred organisms in tightly controlled situations\nmight permit successful extrapolation to the development of traits in\nan ecological context (as pursued, for example, in investigations of\nstrategies of growth and reproduction over the life course and\nplasticity of traits under environmental variation [\u201cphenotypic\nplasticity\u201d;\n developmental biology]).\n Yet, again, the need for reintegration of these aspects of naturally\nvariable situations may readily get discounted. Consider animal\nexperiments viewed as models for human medicine. Questions are\nroutinely raised about the validity of, say, mice as a model for\nhumans. However, even to speak of \u201cmice\u201d and\n\u201chumans\u201d is an abstraction that discounts the variation\namong mice and the variation among humans. If, instead, the variation\nwere paid attention to, the first step would be to note that highly\nselected strains of laboratory mice are less variable than\nundomesticated populations (Rader 2004) and experiments made on such\nmice involve tightly controlled situations. To what extent, it could\nthen be asked, do experimental observations hold for individuals from\nundomesticated populations raised in varied and far more complex\nsituations? If mechanisms have been exposed using laboratory mice\n(Tabery 2014), to what extent do they depend on the controlled value\nof factors that are not typically enumerated when describing the\nmechanism? Of course, this line of questioning is preempted when\nbiotechnology expands its capacity to control conditions and harness\ngenetically engineered organisms to produce desired products.\n(Biotechnology can be seen as the industrial manifestation of\nanalytic biology, the program that seeks to understand\norganisms by cutting them up into some appropriate small parts.\nRelevant here are the politics, economics, and cultural dimensions of\nthe rise of biotechnology and, before that, genetics itself in the\nareas of agriculture, health, food science, the legal system, and\nmore. All that lies beyond this entry\u2019s scope; see\nM\u00fcller-Wille & Brandt 2016.)\n5.2 The Use of Models for Selective Breeding\n\nThe use of models in quantitative genetics and population genetics is\nalso based on control of biological materials and conditions. For\nthese fields, as indicated in this section, it is more difficult to\nformulate programs that reintegrate what had been de-emphasized.\n5.2.1 Quantitative Genetics\n\nMendelian experiments crossing inbred lines met the goal of Johannsen\n(and biologists following him) of giving repeatable outcomes and\nexposing hidden processes, but quantitative genetics, designed to\nanalyze continuous traits (see sections\n 3.3\n and\n 3.4),\n bore an ambiguous relationship with that goal. Models allowed\nbreeders to predict outcomes under different mating designs;\nthe outcomes were not strictly repeatable given that what was\nactually achieved typically varies from what was predicted. Moreover,\nwhile researchers could imagine that the hidden processes\nwere like the theoretical ones in the models, the theoretical\ngenotypes forming the basis for quantitative genetic models were\nunobservable (see entry on\n scientific realism).\n Nevertheless, material practices of control of materials and\nconditions ensure that the model-based analyses continue to be useful.\nIn particular, when there are discrepancies between outcomes and\npredictions, which may result from the hidden processes being\nunlike the theoretical ones in the models, breeders can\nalways compensate: they can discard the undesired offspring and breed\nfrom the desired ones. And, as breeding programs are elaborated that\nbuild on the models (e.g., Holland et al. 2003), it becomes ever more\ndifficult in practice to implement data analysis that would build up\nfrom an alternative model (see entry on\n pragmatism\n and\n section 4).\n Note, because quantitative genetics involves statistical analysis of\ndata on continuous traits, it must be possible to analyze the data on\ntrait variation using models that avoid reference to what is\nnot observed (Taylor 2012). However, this possibility has not\nbeen pursued in quantitative genetics (and thus becomes a potential\ncase of Stanford\u2019s [2006] unconceived alternatives mentioned\nearlier). Indeed, the difficulty of applying any alternative to\nquantitative genetic models extends to analysis of data on variation\nin human traits, even though in that realm breeding is not an option\nand control of biological material and conditions is minimal. \n\nIf it is difficult in practice to implement breeding programs and data\nanalysis based on models that avoid reference to what is not observed,\nit is difficult to conceive such alternatives without the following\nprescriptive disambiguation. Here a restoration more than a\nreintegration can be entertained, that is, to insist on the\ndistinction between variance in actual observable genotypes and\ngenotypic variance (sometimes shortened to genetic\nvariance, where variance is the statistical measure of variation\nin a given quantity). The latter term stems from breeders using the\nterm genotypic value for the average value of a trait over\nall locations in which they raise or grow the genotype (in the sense\nof classes of individuals related by genealogy from a common ancestor\nor set of ancestors; see\n section 3).\n The variation among these genotypic values is, as shorthand, called\nthe genotypic variance. In other words, the quantity derives from\nstatistical analysis of variation among related and unrelated\nindividuals in their phenotypes (in the sense of observed\ntraits), not in their genotypes (in the sense of DNA). Not\nonly does genotypic variance vary with the mix of genotypes and\nlocations, its statistical estimation does not reference measurable\ngenetic or environmental factors influencing the development of the\ntraits. Unfortunately, it is common for researchers and commentators,\nincluding philosophers, to speak of genotypic or genetic variance in\nterms like the \u201ccontribution of genetic differences to observed\ndifferences among individuals\u201d (Plomin et al. 1997: 83) as if\nvariation in traits and variation in genotypes had some obvious\nrelationship. The conflation may derive from quantitative genetic\nmodels being based on genotypes (in the sense of pairs of genes). But\nthose are theoretical genotypes, unobserved and, as noted above, not\nessential to the analysis of trait variation. (To add to the potential\nfor confusion, the technical term for the ratio of the genotypic\nvariance to the total variance observed in the trait in question is\nHeritability, which has no relation to the existence of a connection\nbetween parent and offspring traits through transmission of genes\n[Taylor 2012].)\n\nTo enhance the disambiguation, Taylor (2012) recommends the use of\nterms familiar in agricultural trials: variety instead of\ngenotype (in the sense of classes of individuals related by genealogy\nfrom a common ancestor or set of ancestors), location instead\nof environment, and trait instead of phenotype (given that\nthis last term implies a connection with a set of genotypes, in the\nsense of pairs of genes). Whether or not the alternatives terms get\nmore widely adopted, once the gap between statistical patterns from\nquantitative genetics and measurable underlying factors is recognized\nand consistently observed, it becomes difficult to follow the\nreasoning of accounts that conflate or slip between the disparate\nmeanings of \u201cgenetic\u201d. This difficulty extends to accounts\nof the interaction between genes or genotypes and environment\nthat overlook the distinction, proceeding then as if interaction as\ndefined in quantitative genetic analyses of variation has some\nconceptual or empirical connection with statistical interaction\nbetween measured presence of genes and environmental variables. (It is\nbeyond the scope of this entry to review such accounts by scientists\nor philosophers; see Taylor 2015 as well as discussion in\nSection 6.5 on what the conflation or ambiguity signifies.)\n\nThere is an alternative to restoration of the distinction between\ngenotypic variance and variation in actual genotypes, which is to\nfocus on the latter. As determining the sequence of DNA at any stretch\nof the genome (i.e., of the genotype-as-material-constituents) has\nbecome routine, Genome-Wide Association (GWA) studies allow estimation\nof the fraction of the variation in the trait that is associated with\nmeasurable genetic variants. (The variants studied are\nsingle-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs], which are not held to be the\nDNA influencing the trait, but simply somewhere close to those factors\non the genome.) It turns out, however, that, even when many genetic\nvariants are examined together, only a small fraction of the variation\nin the trait is associated with\u2014or in statistical terms,\n\u201caccounted for\u201d by\u2014the genetic variants (McCarthy et\nal. 2008). This finding has led to discussions about missing\nheritability (e.g., Manolio et al. 2009). This new heritability\nhas, however, no conceptual or empirical connection with the\nheritability of quantitative genetics. To the extent that the\nadditional ambiguity in use of the term heritability is associated\nwith the unfulfilled expectation that high heritability means genetic\nvariants might account for a large fraction of trait variation, the\nrestoration identified in the previous paragraphs is warranted. \n\nOne plausible explanation of the limited success of GWA studies\ndepends on the distinction between genotypic variance and variance in\nactual genotypes being clearly made. Even if the classical\nquantitative genetic heritability is high and similarity between twins\nor a set of close relatives is associated with the similarity of\nyet-to-be-identified genotypes or genetic factors, the factors may\nnot be the same from one set of relatives to the next, or from one\nlocation (environment) to the next. In other words, the\nunderlying factors and the pathways of development that they influence\nmay be heterogeneous. It could be that pairs of alleles, say,\nAAbbcbDDee, subject to a sequence of environmental factors, say,\nFghiJ, are associated, all other things being equal, with the same\noutcomes as alleles aabbCCDDEE subject to a sequence of environmental\nfactors FgHiJ (Taylor 2012). The possibility of heterogeneous factors\nunderlying similarity in traits obviously recedes if the biological\nmaterials and locations are close to the original set of relatives and\nenvironmental factors. The corollary is that, when users of\nquantitative genetic models overlook that possibility, they are, in\neffect, assuming tight control of biological materials and\nconditions.\n\nSome degree of reintegration of what is unobservable in the classical\nuse of quantitative genetic models has occurred through the technique\nof mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL)\u2014regions of the genome\ncontaining genetic factors associated with variation in a continuously\nvariable trait. Yet QTL mapping has had most success in animal and\nplant varieties that can be replicated and raised in controlled\nconditions; reliable QTL results for human populations are few\n(Majumder & Ghosh 2005; but see the Wellcome Trust Case Control\nConsortium 2007). Indeed, reintegration of the complexities of\ndevelopment in its ecological context, which are collapsed into the\nparameters of the models, remains scarcely developed in quantitative\ngenetics (as evoked for the human case by Turkheimer 2004).\n5.2.2 Population Genetics\n\nIn population genetics, the complexities of development in its\necological context are also collapsed into the parameters of the\nmodels, such as the parameters for surviving and leaving offspring.\nNot surprisingly then, the estimation of the selection coefficients of\ngenotypes (in the sense of pairs of genes) is more readily done when\nthe populations are subject to artificial selection in the laboratory\nthan when frequencies or changes over time are observed in the wild.\nLewontin (1974a) provides grounds for doubting the likelihood of some\nday restoring what is abstracted away in those selection coefficients.\nMeasurements of selection coefficients and other parameters of the\nmodel are possible, Lewontin concludes, only when a single allelic\nsubstitution is associated with a large difference in the trait, not\nwhen the effects of gene substitutions make only small differences.\nThis led him to remark that: \u201cWhat we can measure is by\ndefinition uninteresting and what we are interested in is by\ndefinition unmeasurable\u201d (1974a: 23). The problem of relating\npopulation genetic models to observations becomes astronomically worse\nwhen there are multiple, linked loci (1974: 317). He suggests that\npopulation genetics should shift its attention to the selection\ncoefficients for long segments of chromosomes. This program, like\nJohannsen\u2019s wish that the genotype be seen as a whole, has\nscarcely been pursued. Even if it had been, ecological genetic\nanalysis of variation in natural populations, with all its complexity\n(e.g., Clausen et al. 1948), would still be needed to begin to\nreintegrate ecological context into population genetics. \n6. What the Genotype-Phenotype Distinction Signifies\n\nThat special experimental conditions are entailed in the original\nformulation of the terms genotype, phenotype, and the distinction\nbetween them also has implications for the issues that might seem to\nhave been settled by the adoption of Johannsen\u2019s\ngenotype-concept of heredity.\n6.1 Barrier Between Traits and What is Transmitted to the Next Generation\n\nTo the extent that the DNA transmitted to the next generation has been\nshielded from most of the interactions that occur during the\norganism\u2019s lifetime (both within the organism and with the\nenvironment), there is a barrier to \u201cpeculiar\u201d traits\n(Johannsen\u2019s label for traits acquired during the specific\ndevelopment of the parents) being passed on to their offspring. (A key\npart of this shielding is the one-way transcription of DNA to RNA\n[which then codes for the amino acids that make up proteins], not, in\ngeneral, transcription in the other direction.) While the\ngenotype-phenotype distinction can be seen to signify the\nexistence of this barrier, there is a long history of researchers\nclaiming to show ways around it. Most notably, the modern science of\nepigenetics, building on ever-increasing information about DNA\nsequences and how genes function, shows how chemicals from outside the\ncell can modify the activity of genes for the rest of an\norganism\u2019s life and sometimes even into subsequent generations\n(Stotz 2006). \n\nDevelopmental Systems Theory (Oyama, Griffiths, & Gray 2001),\nEvolutionary developmental biology (\u201cevo-devo\u201d) (Moczek et\nal. 2015), and a Post-genomic Synthesis in Behavior and Cognition\nResearch (Stotz 2008) also argue for attention to extended\ninheritance, which includes transmission not only of epigenetic\nmodifications, but also of resources outside the organism, such as\nwhen reptiles lay their eggs in places that ensure the right\ntemperature for incubation. This last example also fits under the\nambit of Niche Construction theory (Odling-Smee et al. 2003). This\nfield investigates the significance of organisms shaping the\necological context in which they develop their traits, survive, and\nreproduce, as epitomized by beavers living in the ecosystem of ponds\nformed by the dams that they build and maintain. (Whether or not\nepigenetic and extra-organismal resources have the same causal status\nas genes is a matter of philosophical debate beyond the scope of this\nentry; see Waters 2007; Stotz 2006; Griffiths & Stotz 2013; entry\non\n inheritance systems,\n and\n section 7\n below.)\n6.2 Evolution Defined as Change in Gene Frequencies\n\nBiological evolution, in its most general construal, is modification\nby descent, that is, change over time in frequency of observed traits\nor forms in a population or a taxonomic group derived from a common\nancestor. A narrower definition, however, arose with the rise of a\ngenotypic conception of heredity, namely, only with changes in\nfrequencies of genes is evolution deemed to be happening. The barrier\nto so-called inheritance of acquired characteristics is held to make\nirrelevant any changes in forms without changes in gene frequencies.\nExponents of extended inheritance disagree, including in their\ndefinition of evolution the changes in the developmental system and\nits constructed niche (Griffiths & Stotz 2013). Adjudication of\nthe disagreement comes down, in part, to a matter of quantity: How\nsignificant are resources other than the genotype (in the sense of the\nDNA of the whole genome) in development of traits that influence\nsurvival and reproductive success? Significance may depend on the\nnumber of generations that the resources are transmitted. The\ndisagreement, however, becomes qualitative, even radical, if attention\nis given to the dynamics of development in an ecological context that\nhad been abstracted away in demonstrating the original genotype\nconception of heredity. Reintegrating developmental dynamics entails\nmore than noting the existence of developmental noise, such as when\nDrosophila individuals are not symmetric in the number of bristles on\neach side. The next subsection elaborates.\n6.3 Development as a Genotype to Phenotype Relationship\n\nSeveral of the programs of reintegration sketched in\n section 5\n rest on the idea that development of traits will eventually be\nunderstood in terms of a composite of the influences of DNA variants\non the organism. An alternative approach is to observe that germ cells\nare organized structures, which means that development is always a\nprocess of further organization emerging from initial organization.\nThat emphasis was evident, not only in developmental mechanics\n(Entwickslungsmechanik), but also in a mid-twentieth century\nform of epigenetics centered on embryological or developmental\npathways. Conrad Waddington, for example, undertook experiments on\nvariation in certain characters that was originally seen only in\nresponse to an environmental stress, e.g., enlarged anal papillae (a\nfleshy protuberance) of Drosophila larvae that arose in\nhigher salt concentrations (Waddington 1959). In populations that had\nbeen selected for that responsiveness, eventually the trait occurred\neven when that stress was withdrawn. Waddington\u2019s interpretation\nis that a genotype (in the sense of a specific set of pairs of genes)\nhad arisen in the population that switched on development of large\npapillae. Presumably, this could happen through reassortment of genes\ninto new genotypes, not a random mutation. An alternative hypothesis,\nwhich places more emphasis on the dynamics of development, is that, if\nmany pathways in a non-inbred population can produce the same response\n(e.g., enlarged anal papillae in response to salt), selection results\nin a population of individuals that have a concentration or redundancy\nof the various pathways. If pathways arise within this\nconcentration where large papillae develop without the salt stress,\nthat is not a logical process to be modeled by population genetic or\nquantitative genetic models, but a contingent outcome of the dynamics\nof development in a realm in which a variety of genotypes can\ninfluence a variety of paths to a trait. In this light, to call traits\nphenotypes, and thus suggest that they have a direct association with\na specific genotype, is to make it more difficult to conceive and\npursue a program of reintegration in which researchers examine cases\nof traits that are acquired as an appropriate response to\nenvironmental condition and then increase in frequency in a\npopulation. Moreover, even if such cases turn out not to be common,\nthey trouble the premise that the individual-to-individual\nbarrier to a trait being transmitted back into the genotype\nbarrier means that acquired characters cannot increase in a\npopulation during evolution.\n6.4 What Counts is Underneath or Inside the Observable Surface\n\nThe genotype-phenotype distinction can also signify that the\nsurface\u2014phenotype\u2014is mere appearance; what is underneath\nor inside that surface\u2014the genotype\u2014is what counts. A\nsmall irony, given that the phenotype originated in relation to\ninferring genotypes (in the sense of a class that shared something\nunobservable), is that, to the extent that molecular biology has made\nDNA sequences observable, especially at sites in which the sequences\nvary from one group to another, each genotype (in the sense of a pair\nof genes or DNA sequence) becomes another phenotype (Nachtomy et al.\n2009). During the development of an organism, each of these\ngenotypes-as-phenotypes at time 0 interacts with the rest of the\nphenotype and environmental factors to produce the phenotype at time\n1, 2, and so on. It may well be the case that germ cells arise at some\npoint in the life course that are buffered from most of these\ninteractions. However, with respect to conceptualizing development\nfrom time 0 till death, nothing logically makes the genotype not also\na phenotype.\n\nIn any case, the view is widespread that what counts is underneath or\ninside. It is evident in the definition of evolution as change in gene\nfrequencies and the idea that development of traits will eventually be\nunderstood in terms of a composite of the influences of DNA variants\non the organism. It can also be seen in many other features of\ndiscourses around heredity, such as the following:\n\n An oft-repeated assertion is that random mutations in genes are\nthe ultimate source of variation on which evolution builds. This\nassertion discounts the reassortment of genes into new combinations of\ngenotypes (in the sense of pairs of genes) that occurs with every\nsexual reproduction and with the recombination after crossing over of\nchromosomes that occurs in many species, as well as with niche\nconstruction and novel response to environmental conditions that can\noccur during development.\n Discussions of the unit of selection, typically a gene or\ngenotype (in the sense of a specific pair of genes), often assume or\nimply that, when organisms are shown to enjoy differential survival\nand reproductive success because of the effect of some trait they\npossess, it is actually because they possess some gene or genotype. In\nsome accounts, the organism becomes the \u201cselfish\u201d\ngene\u2019s way of making copies of itself. Such a picture is a\nvariant of a theme with a long history, namely, the living being is an\nagent directed by some other agent, such as in theology when the soul\nis given by the grace of God.\n The use of the term phenotype for a trait suggests a direct\nassociation with some genotype even when there is no program, let\nalone a method, to expose which genotypes influence the trait.\n The claim is made that all disease is genetic. The corresponding\nprograms of genetic medicine, personalized genomics, and precision\nmedicine, propose or promise to identify and make therapeutic use of\ngenetically determined disease susceptibility in individual patients.\nNot only do such programs discount the environmental and social\naspects of epidemiological trends in many diseases, but, as evident\nwhen genetic oncologists use the term \u201cfamilial cancer\u201d in\ncontrast to hereditary cancers, this conception of heredity brings\nback what Johannsen had sought to expunge, namely, thinking about the\ntransmission of peculiar or acquired traits.\n Invocation of \u201cgenetic tendency\u201d without a method to\ninfer it from analysis of traits\u2014even when done by commentators\ncritical of claims made about genetics, as in \u201csimply because a\ngenetic tendency exists does not mean it will be phenotypically\nexpressed\u201d (Jesser 2002, 42).\n It is now popular to boast that \u201cit\u2019s in our\nDNA\u201d, in the sense of a core value that is beyond question for\nan organization or group.\n\n6.5 Findings About Heredity Derived Using One Meaning of Terms Affirm Findings Derived Using a Different Meaning\n\nWith genetics held to get at the fundamental thing that counts in\nheredity, it makes it plausible to take research using methods based\non one kind of meaning of the terms genotype, phenotype, and the\ndistinction between them to affirm research based on another\nmeaning\u2014they are all contributing to an understanding of that\nfundamental something. In this spirit, the ascendance of the\npredominant current meaning\u2014DNA versus traits\u2014has not\nnecessitated rejection or even disambiguation of the other meanings of\nthe terms evident in Johannsen (1911) and that have coexisted\nsince\u2014class, abstraction, or material constituents; whole or\npart; natural units or products of experimental control\n (sections 1\u20133).\n Not being troubled by the ambiguity of different meanings and methods\nis especially evident when commentators speak of \u201cthe\nnature-nurture debate\u201d as if it were unimportant to specify\nwhich nature-nurture science is being debated. In practice, at least\nfive nature-nurture sciences can be readily distinguished (Taylor\n2015):\n\n Researchers in laboratory and agricultural breeding or human\nquantitative geneticists compare how much variation in a trait is\nassociated with differences among means for varieties, locations,\nvariety-location combinations, and residual contributions (i.e.,\ngenotypic, environmental, genotype-environment interaction, and\nresidual variance where genotype here means a line or genealogically\ndefined group; see\n section 3.3)\n Researchers compare how much variation in a trait is associated\nwith differences in measured genetic factors, environmental factors,\ngene-environment interaction, and a residual component (where the\ngenetic factors are typically genotypes in the sense of a pair of\ngenes).\n Through either of the above forms of analysis, researchers try to\ncompare the variation within groups (e.g., among Euro-Americans and\namong African-Americans) to the difference between the averages for\nthe groups.\n Through investigations that might extend any of the preceding\nkinds of analysis of observational data, researchers piece together a\npicture of the processes of development of a trait and, on that basis,\nspeak to the fixity versus flexibility of traits. (The multiple\nmeanings of genotype, summarized above, arise in research and\ndiscussions on this topic.)\n Researchers provide an evolutionary account of the increase in\nfrequency of a trait through natural selection based on the\ntrait\u2019s superior function in the environment (see\n section 6.2).\n\n\nThese nature-nurture sciences entail not only different methods but\nalso different control of materials and conditions, so, in practice,\nresults are difficult to translate from one of them to the next.\nDiscussion of the nature-nurture debate (even in critical\naccounts where nature and nurture are said to interact or shape each\nother) signifies, among other things, that the specialness of the\nconditions involved in the original formulation and demonstration of\nthe genotype-phenotype distinction may be overlooked. As a\nconsequence, for example, control of materials and conditions that is\npractical in laboratory and agricultural breeding gets built into\nevolutionary thinking when the latter uses models and terms from\nbreeding as if there were also a selector in naturally variable\npopulations. \n\nGranted, as noted earlier, biotechnology has a growing capacity to\ncontrol conditions and harness genetically engineered organisms to\nproduce desired products. However, to the extent that biological\ntheory is still meant to address naturally variable populations, then\nconcepts, methods, and models are needed through which what has been\ncontrolled or de-emphasized might be brought back and\nre-integrated into the scientific accounts. The framing of\nthis entry in terms of control and reintegration has been designed to\ndraw attention to the space around the genotype-phenotype distinction\nthat remains open for conceptual clarification and methodological\nadvances.\n7. Coda on Causality\n\nThe introduction noted that, if the genotype-phenotype\nrelationship had been the focus of this entry, more attention\nwould need to be given to philosophical arguments about causality and\nabout abstraction as it relates to causal claims. Yet, realizing any\nof the programs of reintegration mentioned in this entry would entail\nrich causal analyses: networks of gene regulation linked to organized\nstructures that branch into more organized structures, epigenetic\nmodifications during and across lifespans, organisms shaping the\ndynamics of the ecological context in which they develop their traits,\nand frequencies of traits changing in populations over generations.\nThis said, in realms of experimentally controlled biological materials\nand conditions, a simpler sense of causality may seem plausible,\nnamely, a difference that makes a difference (see entry on\n causation and manipulability).\n (The serious debate about whether statistical analysis can\ndistinguish causal from non-causal differences that \u201cmake\u201d\na difference should be noted; Hern\u00e1n et al. 2002.) The\nconnection between an association within some population and causal\nmechanisms is susceptible to disconfirmation by experiments. At the\nsame time, doing such experiments invites scrutiny of the relationship\nof experimentally altered dynamics to the original dynamics that\ngenerated the data that were analyzed to show the original statistical\nassociation (Taylor 2015). \n\nMost importantly given the framing of this entry around control and\nreintegration: Any experimental as well as statistical association is\nalso conditional on the subset of the population or species\nstudied and the situations where they are observed (Lewontin 1974b).\nUnderstanding associations and formulating manipulations based on them\nrequires attention to what has been experimentally or, at least,\nstatistically held constant. In other words, in controlled conditions\nthe direction of the arrow labeled identification in Figures\n 2\n and\n 3\n may be reversed and given a causal connotation, but the causality is\nconditional on the factors, including the rest of the organism, held\nconstant. The understanding and manipulations may well extrapolate\nbeyond the original, controlled population and situations (and thus\nmatch the general theory summarized in\n Figure 1),\n but, absent an actual program of reintegration, there is no basis for\nassuming that they will. While Waters (2007), Tabery (2014) and others\nwould give greater status to differences that have actually\nbeen observed to make a difference (Griffiths & Stotz 2013), this\nentry has pointed to the control of biological materials and\nconditions that excludes many factors\u2014genetic as well\nas environmental, structural as well as particulate\u2014from\nbeing seen to make a difference. Ironically, if\nappearances are not to mislead and obscure, or be spun into\nspeculative theories\n (section 2),\n the science of heredity needs methods that bring back what was\nabstracted away under the experimental control that made\nJohannsen\u2019s original genotype-conception meaningful.\n",
