    "main_text": "Lotteries and the Lottery Paradox\n3. Lotteries and the Lottery Paradox\n\nLotteries pose a problem for the theory that a high probability for a\ntrue belief suffices for knowledge. Given that there are a million\ntickets and only one winner, the probability of \u2018This ticket is\na losing ticket\u2019 is very high. Yet we are reluctant to say this\nmakes the proposition known.\n\nWe overcome the inhibition after the winning ticket is announced. Now\nthe ticket is known to be a loser and tossed in the trash. But wait!\nTestimony does not furnish certainty. Nor does perception or\nrecollection . When pressed, we admit there is a small chance that we\nmisperceived the drawing or that the newscaster misread the winning\nnumber or that we are misremembering. While in this concessive mood,\nwe are apt to relinquish our claim to know. The skeptic syllogizes\nfrom this surrender: For any contingent proposition, there is a\nlottery statement that is more probable and which is unknown. A known\nproposition cannot be less probable than an unknown proposition. So no\ncontingent proposition is known (Hawthorne 2004). That is too\nmuch to give up! Yet the skeptic\u2019s statistics seem impeccable.\n\nThis skeptical paradox was noticed by Gilbert Harman (1968, 166). But\nhis views about the role of causation in inferential knowledge seemed\nto solve the problem (DeRose 2017, chapter 5). The baby paradox was\ndismissed as stillborn. Since the new arrival did not get the\ncustomary baptism of attention, epistemologists did not notice that\nthe demise of the causal theory of knowledge meant new life for\nHarman\u2019s lottery paradox.\n\nThe probability skeptic\u2019s ordinary suggestions about how we\nmight be mistaken contrast with the extraordinary possibilities\nconjured by Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019 skeptic. The Cartesian\nskeptic tries to undermine vast swaths of knowledge with a single\nuntestable counter-explanation of the evidence (such as the hypothesis\nthat you are dreaming or the hypothesis that an evil demon is\ndeceiving you). These comprehensive alternatives are designed to evade\nany empirical refutation. The probabilistic skeptic, in contrast,\npoints to a plethora of pedestrian counter-explanations. Each is easy\nto test: maybe you transposed the digits of a phone number, maybe the\nticket agent thought you wanted to fly to Moscow, Russia rather than\nMoscow, Idaho, etc. You can check for errors, but any check itself has\na small chance of being wrong. So there is always something to check,\ngiven that the issues cannot be ignored on grounds of\nimprobability.\n\nYou can check any of these possible errors but you cannot\ncheck them all. You cannot discount these pedestrian\npossibilities as science fiction. These are exactly the sorts of\npossibilities we check when plans go awry. For instance, you think you\nknow that you have an appointment to meet a prospective employer for\nlunch at noon. When she fails to show at the expected time, you\nbackpedal through your premises: Is your watch slow? Are you\nremembering the right restaurant? Could there be another restaurant in\nthe city with the same name? Is she just detained? Could she have just\nforgotten? Could there have been a miscommunication?\n\nProbabilistic skepticism dates back to Arcesilaus who took over the\nAcademy two generations after Plato\u2019s death. This moderate kind\nof skepticism, recounted by Cicero (Academica 2.74, 1.46)\nfrom his days as a student at the Academy, allows for justified\nbelief. Many scientists feel they should only assign probabilities.\nThey dismiss the epistemologist\u2019s preoccupation with knowledge\nas old-fashioned.\n\nDespite the early start of the qualitative theory of probability, the\nquantitative theory did not develop until Blaise Pascal\u2019s study\nof gambling in the seventeenth century (Hacking 1975). Only in the\neighteenth century did it penetrate the insurance industry (even\nthough insurers realized that a fortune could be made by accurately\ncalculating risk). Only in the nineteenth century did probability make\na mark in physics. And only in the twentieth century do probabilists\nmake important advances over Arcesilaus.\n\nMost of these philosophical advances are reactions to the use of\nprobability by scientists. In the twentieth century, editors of\nscience journals began to demand that the author\u2019s hypothesis\nshould be accepted only when it was sufficiently probable \u2013 as\nmeasured by statistical tests. The threshold for acceptance was\nacknowledged to be somewhat arbitrary. And it was also conceded that\nthe acceptance rule might vary with one\u2019s purposes. For\ninstance, we demand a higher probability when the cost of accepting a\nfalse hypothesis is high.\n\nIn 1961 Henry Kyburg pointed out that this policy conflicted with a\nprinciple of agglomeration: If you rationally believe \\(p\\)\nand rationally believe \\(q\\) then you\nrationally believe both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\nLittle pictures of the same scene should sum to a bigger picture of\nthe same scene. If rational belief can be based on an acceptance rule\nthat only requires a high probability, there will be rational belief\nin a contradiction! To see why, suppose the acceptance rule permits\nbelief in any proposition that has a probability of at least .99.\nGiven a lottery with 100 tickets and exactly one winner, the\nprobability of \u2018Ticket \\(n\\) is a loser\u2019\nlicenses belief. Symbolize propositions about ticket \\(n\\)\nbeing a loser as \\(p_n\\). Symbolize \u2018I\nrationally believe\u2019 as \\(B\\). Belief in a\ncontradiction follows:\n\n\\(B{\\sim}(p_1 \\amp p_2 \\amp \\ldots \\amp p_{100})\\),\n\nby the probabilistic acceptance rule.\n\\(Bp_1 \\amp Bp_2 \\amp \\ldots \\amp Bp_{100}\\),\n\nby the probabilistic acceptance rule.\n\\(B(p_1 \\amp p_2 \\amp \\ldots \\amp p_{100})\\),\n\nfrom (2) and the principle that rational belief agglomerates.\n\\(B[(p_1 \\amp p_2 \\amp \\ldots \\amp p_{100}) \\amp{\\sim}(p_1 \\amp\np_2 \\amp \\ldots \\amp p_{100})]\\),\n\nfrom (1) and (3) by the principle that rational belief\nagglomerates.\n\n\nMore informally, the acceptance rule implies this: each belief that a particular ticket will lose is probable enough to justify believing it. By repeated\napplications of the agglomeration principle, conjoining all of these\njustified beliefs together gives a justified belief. Finally,\nconjoining that belief with the justified belief that one of tickets\nis a winner gives the contradictory belief to the to the effect that\neach will lose and one will win. Yet by agglomeration that too is\njustified.\n\nSince belief in an obvious contradiction is a paradigm example of\nirrationality, Kyburg poses a dilemma: either reject agglomeration or\nreject rules that license belief for a probability of less than one.\n(Martin Smith 2016, 186\u2013196) warns that even a probability of\none leads to joint inconsistency for a lottery that has infinitely\nmany tickets.) Kyburg rejects agglomeration. He promotes toleration of\njoint inconsistency (having beliefs that cannot all be true\ntogether) to avoid belief in contradictions. Reason forbids us from\nbelieving a proposition that is necessarily false but permits us to\nhave a set of beliefs that necessarily contains a falsehood. Henry\nKyburg\u2019s choice was soon supported by the discovery of a\ncompanion paradox.\n",
