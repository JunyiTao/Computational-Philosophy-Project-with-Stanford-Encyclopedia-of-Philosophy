    "main_text": "Modern Forms of Civic Education || John Dewey: School as Community\n4.4 John Dewey: School as Community\n\nJohn Dewey argued that, from the 18th century onward,\nstates came to see education as the best means of perpetuating and\nrecovering their political power. But \u201cthe maintenance of a\nparticular national sovereignty required subordination of individuals\nto the superior interests of the state both in military defense and in\nstruggles for international supremacy in commerce\u2026To form the\ncitizen, not the \u2018man,\u2019 became the aim of education\u201d\n(1916, 90).\n\nIn a democracy, however, because of its combination of \u201cnumerous\nand more varied points of shared common interest\u201d and its\nrequirement of \u201ccontinuous readjustment through meeting the new\nsituations produced by varied intercourse,\u201d which Dewey called\n\u201cprogress,\u201d education could address personal development\nand \u201cfull and free interplay\u201d among social groups (Ibid,\n83, 79). In other words, it is in democratic states that we want to\nlook for the preparation of good persons as well as good citizens;\nthat is, for democratic education, which in this context, to repeat\nfor emphasis, is what is meant by civic education.\n\nNowhere is there a better site for political or democratic action than\nthe school itself, the students\u2019 own community. This is\nDewey\u2019s insight (1916). Creating a democratic culture within the\nschools not only facilitates preparing students for democratic\nparticipation in the political system, but it also fosters a\ndemocratic environment that shapes the relationships with adults and\namong peers that the students already engage in. \u201cStudents learn\nmuch more from the way a school is run,\u201d comments Theodore\nSizer, \u201cand the best way to teach values is when the school is a\nliving example of the values to be taught\u201d (1984, 120, 122).\n\nReal problems, and not hypotheticals or academic exercises, are, Dewey\nargued, always of real concern to students. So in addition to\nactivities of writing and classroom discussion, typical of\ntoday\u2019s public schools, students should engage in \u201cactive\ninquiry and careful deliberation in the significant and vital\nproblems\u201d that confront their communities, however defined but\nespecially their schools (1910, 55). Book lessons and classroom\ndiscussions rarely connect with decision-making on issues that affect\nthat community. In fact, Dewey comments that traditional methods of\ninstruction are often \u201cforeign to the existing capacities of the\nyoung\u2026beyond the reach of [their] experience\u2026[T]he very\nsituation forbids much active participation by pupils\u201d (1938,\n19).\n\nAs a core of learning Dewey wanted \u201can experiential\ncontinuum\u201d (1938, 28, 33). The experiences that he wanted to\npromote were those that underscored healthy growth; those, in other\nwords, that generated a greater desire to learn and to keep on\nlearning and that built upon prior experiences. \u201c[D]emocratic\nsocial experiences\u201d were superior in providing \u201ca better\nquality of human experience\u201d than any other form of social or\npolitical organization (Ibid, 34).\n\nOne logical, and practical, possibility was to make the operations of\nthe school part of the curriculum. Let the students use their\nin-school experiences to make, or help make, decisions that directly\naffect some of the day-to-day operations of the school\u2014student\ndiscipline, maintenance of the grounds and buildings, problems with\ncliques, issues of sexism and racism, incidents of ostracism, and the\nlike\u2014as well as topics and issues inside the classrooms.\n\nDewey thought of schools as \u201cembryo communities\u201d (1915,\n174), \u201cinstitution[s] in which the child is, for the\ntime\u2026to be a member of a community life in which he feels that\nhe participates, and to which he contributes\u201d (1916, 88). We\nneed not become sidetracked in questioning just what Dewey means by,\nor what we should mean by, \u201ccommunity\u201d to grasp the sense\nthat he is after. It is not surprising that Dewey wanted to give\nstudents experience in making decisions that affect their lives in\nschools. What is surprising is that so little democracy takes place in\nschools and that those who spend the most time in schools have the\nleast opportunity to experience it.\n\nThe significance of democratic decision-making within the schools and\nabout the wider community\u2014the making of actual decisions through\ndemocratic means\u2014cannot be overstated. As a propaedeutic to\ndemocratic participation, political action of this sort is invaluable.\nMelissa S. Williams comments: \u201c\u2026[L]earning cooperation as\na practice is the only way to develop individuals\u2019\nsense of agency to reshape the world they share with others. It\nteaches moderation in promoting one\u2019s own vision, and the\ncapacity of individuals to see themselves as part of a project of\ncollective self-rule\u201d (2005, 238; emphasis in original).\n\nOf course, not everything in school should be decided democratically.\nThere are some areas in which decisions require expertise\u2014a\ncombination of experience and knowledge\u2014that rules out students\nas decision-makers. Chief among such areas is pedagogy. Because the\nteachers and administrators know more about the processes of education\nand about their subjects, because they have firsthand and often\nintimate knowledge of the range and nature of abilities and problems\nof their students\u2014a point emphasized by Dewey (1938,\n56)\u2014as well as the particular circumstances in which the\nlearning takes place, they and not the students should make\npedagogical decisions.\n\nAt the same time, because many students are still children, the\ndecisions that they are to make should be age-appropriate. Not all\ndemocratic procedures or school issues are suitable for all ages.\nDifferences in cognitive, social, and emotional development,\nespecially at the elementary-school level, complicate democratic\naction. While all students may have the same capacity as potentiality,\nactivating those capacities requires development, as noted in the\ndiscussion of a two-phased form of civic education.\n\nDeweyan ideas about the school as a community live on in several kinds\nof practice. First, in some experimental schools, students, teachers,\nand parents actually govern democratically. In a Sudbury School (of\nwhich the first was founded in Sudbury, Massachusetts in 1968), the\nwhole community governs the institution through weekly town\nmeetings.\n\nMuch more common is to give students some degree of voice in the\ngovernance of a school through an elected student government,\nstudent-run media, and policies that encourage students to express\ntheir opinions.\n\nAnother very prevalent approach is to support and encourage students\nto manage their own voluntary associations within a school: clubs,\nteams, etc. Thomas & McFarland (2010) and others have found\npositive affects of extracurricular participation on voting, and a\nplausible explanation is that adolescents become active citizens by\nmanaging their own mini-communities.\n",
