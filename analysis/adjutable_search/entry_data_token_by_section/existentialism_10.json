    "main_text": "Authenticity\n5. Authenticity\nExistentialism is well known for its critique of mass society and\nour tendency to conform to the levelled-down norms and expectations of\nthe public. Rather than living our own lives, we tend to get\npulled along by the crowd, doing what \u201cthey\u201d do. As\nHeidegger writes, \u201cWe take pleasure and enjoy ourselves as they\ntake pleasure. We read, see, and judge about literature and\nart as they see and judge \u2026 we find\n\u2018shocking\u2019 what they find shocking. The\n\u2018they\u2019\u2026 prescribes the kind of being of\neverydayness\u201d (1927 [1962, 126\u20137]). Living this way can be\ncomforting, creating the illusion that we are living well because we\nare doing what everyone else does. But for the existentialist, this\nconformist way of being is a manifestation of inauthenticity or\nself-deception because it shows how we are unwilling or unable to face\nup to the freedom and contingency of our condition; it reveals the\nextent to which we are afraid of being an individual, of being true to\nourselves, and of making our own life-defining choices.\nIn The Sickness unto Death, Kierkegaard describes\ninauthenticity in terms of fleeing from ourselves, of \u201cnot\nwanting to be oneself, [of] wanting to be rid of oneself\u201d (1849\n[1989, 43]). Insofar as we let others decide our lives for us, we live\na life that is bereft of passion, a life of \u201cbloodless\nindolence,\u201d where we are unwilling or unable to \u201cmake a\nreal commitment.\u201d (Kierkegaard 1846 [1946, 266\u201367]). Similarly,\nHeidegger will refer to this condition as a form of estrangement that\n\u201calienates Dasein from itself,\u201d where we exist as a\n\u201cthey-self\u201d (Man-selbst) that drifts along in\nlockstep with others. (1927 [1962, 254\u201355]) And this self-estrangement\nis numbing or \u201ctranquilizing\u201d (beruhigend) because\nit covers over the anxiety of own freedom and finitude.\nSartre and Beauvoir refer to inauthenticity in terms of \u201cbad\nfaith\u201d (mauvaise foi), where we either deny or\nover-identify with one of the two aspects of human existence, either\nfacticity or transcendence. I am in bad faith, for example, when I\nover-identify with my factical situation and deny my freedom to act on\nand transform this situation. I am also in bad faith when I\nover-identify with freedom and deny my past conduct and the fact that\nmy choices are limited and constrained by my situation. Sartre and\nBeauvoir recognize that the self is never wholly free or wholly\ndetermined; it is structurally unstable, it is a \u201cdouble-\nproperty \u2026 that is at once a facticity and a transcendence\u201d\n(Sartre 1943 [1956, 98]). When we cling to one or the other of these\npoles, we are denying this \u201cdouble-property,\u201d and this is a\ndenial of the fundamental ambiguity and instability at the core of the\nhuman condition.\n",
