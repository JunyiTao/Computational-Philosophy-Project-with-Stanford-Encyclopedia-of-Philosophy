    "main_text": "Realist Responses || Language Use and Understanding\n4.1 Language Use and Understanding\n\nWe now turn to some realist responses to these challenges. The\nManifestation and Language Acquisition arguments allege there is\nnothing in an agent\u2019s cognitive or linguistic behaviour that\ncould provide evidence that s/he had grasped what it is for a sentence\nto be true in the realist\u2019s sense of \u2018true\u2019. How can\nyou manifest a grasp of a notion which can apply or fail to apply\nwithout you being able to tell which? How could you ever learn to use\nsuch a concept?\n\nOne possible realist response is that the concept of truth is actually\nvery simple, and it is spurious to demand that one always be able to\ndetermine whether a concept applies. As to the first part, it is often\nargued that all there is to the notion of truth is what is given by\nthe formula \u201c\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 is true if and only if\n\\(p\\)\u201d. The function of the truth-predicate is to disquote\nsentences in the sense of undoing the effects of quotation\u2014thus\nall that one is saying in calling the sentence \u201cYeti are\nvicious\u201d true is that Yeti are vicious.\n\nIt is not clear that this response really addresses the\nanti-realist\u2019s worry, however. It may well be that there is a\nsimple algorithm for learning the meaning of \u2018true\u2019 and\nthat, consequently, there is no special difficulty in learning to\napply the concept. But that by itself does not tell us whether the\npredicate \u2018true\u2019 applies to cases where we cannot\nascertain that it does. All the algorithm tells us, in effect, is that\nif it is legitimate to assert \\(p\\) it is legitimate to assert that\n\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 is true. So are we entitled to assert\n\u2018either Socrates did or did not sneeze in his sleep the night\nbefore he took the hemlock\u2019 or are we not? Presumably that will\ndepend on what we mean by the sentence, whether we mean to be\nadverting to two states of affairs neither of which we have any\nprospect of ever confirming.\n\nAnti-realists follow verificationists in rejecting the intelligibility\nof such states of affairs and tend to base their rules for assertion\non intuitionistic logic, which rejects the universal applicability of\nthe Law of Bivalence (the principle that every statement is either\ntrue or false). This law is thought to be a foundational semantic\nprinciple for classical logic. However, some question whether\nclassical logic requires bivalence [e.g. Sandqvist 2009]. Others\ndispute the idea that acceptance or rejection of bivalence has any\nmetaphysical (rather than meaning-theoretic) consequences\n[Edgington, 1981; McDowell 1976; Pagin 1998; Gaiffman 1996]. There is,\nin addition, a question as to whether the anti-realist\u2019s\npreferred substitute for realist truth-conditions in\nverification-conditions (or proof-conditions) satisfies the\nrequirement of exhaustive manifestability [Pagin 2009]. \n\nA more direct realist response to the Manifestation challenge points\nto the prevalence in our linguistic practices of realist-inspired\nbeliefs to which we give expression in what we say and do [McDowell\n1976]. We assert things like \u201ceither there were an odd or an\neven number of dinosaurs on this planet independently of what anyone\nbelieves\u201d and all our actions and other assertions confirm that\nwe really do believe this. Furthermore, the overwhelming acceptance of\nclassical logic by mathematicians and scientists and their rejection\nof intuitionistic logic for the purposes of mainstream science\nprovides very good evidence for the coherence and usefulness of a\nrealist understanding of truth [Edgington 1981; Burgess 1984; Hellman\n1989, 1992]. \n\nAnti-realists reject this reply. They argue that all we make manifest\nby asserting things like \u201ceither there were an odd or an even\nnumber of dinosaurs on this planet independently of what anyone\nbelieves\u201d is our pervasive misunderstanding of the notion of\ntruth. They apply the same diagnosis to the realist\u2019s belief in\nthe mind-independence of entities in the world and to counterfactuals\nwhich express this belief. We overgeneralize the notion of truth,\nbelieving that it applies in cases where it does not, they contend\n[Tennant 1987, 1997; Wright 1993]. \n\nAn apparent consequence of their view is that reality is indeterminate\nin surprising ways\u2014we have no grounds for asserting that\nSocrates did sneeze in his sleep the night before he took the hemlock\nand no grounds for asserting that he did not and no prospect of ever\nfinding out which. Does this mean that for anti-realists the world\ncontains no such fact as the fact that Socrates did one or the other\nof these two things? Not necessarily. For anti-realists who subscribe\nto intuitionistic principles of reasoning, the most that can be said\nis that there is no present warrant to assert \\(S \\lor \\neg S\\): that\nSocrates either did or did not sneeze in his sleep the night before he\ntook the hemlock.\n\nPerhaps anti-realists are right. But if so, they need to explain how a\npractice based on a pervasive illusion can be as successful as modern\nscience. Anti-realists perturbed by the manifestability of realist\ntruth are revisionists about parts of our linguistic practice, and the\nconsequence of this revisionist stance is that mathematics and science\nrequire extensive and non-trivial revision. The debate about whether\nclassical logic should (or can) be rejected on meaning-theoretic\ngrounds is ongoing: Burgess 1984, Hellman 1989, Michael 1999 and Read\n2000 are critical of Dummett\u2019s case for rejecting classical\nlogic, whereas Cogburn 2005, Cozzo 1994, Prawitz 1977, 1987, 1994 and\nTennant 1997 are, in varying degrees, supportive. \n",
