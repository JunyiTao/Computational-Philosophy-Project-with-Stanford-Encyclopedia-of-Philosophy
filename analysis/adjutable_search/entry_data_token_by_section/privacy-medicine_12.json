    "main_text": "Proprietary Privacy\n4. Proprietary Privacy\n\nMoral and legal theorists have offered accounts of the relationship\nbetween \u201cproperty\u201d and \u201cprivacy\u201d,\n\u201cproperty rights\u201d and \u201cprivacy rights\u201d (May\n1988; Radin 1987; Thomson 1975). Philosophers have debated the\nexistence of a property right in the self, both the physical self and\nthe non-physical self (e.g., the mind or soul) (Lakoff & Johnson\n1999). One philosopher has argued that we own our selves and owe\nourselves a self-love that constrains how we ought to treat our selves\nand allow others to treat us (Annas 1989).\n\nJohn Locke famously characterized the relationship between a person\nand her body as self-ownership. However, other philosophers have held\nthat persons are stewards of their bodies rather than owners (Honore\n1961). In medical contexts, under rubrics of privacy, individuals are\nsometimes ascribed rights of self-ownership and the ownership of parts\nand products of their bodies (Moore 2005). In this vein, a\nphilosophically interesting invasion of privacy argument was advanced\nin the landmark California case Moore v. Regents of the University\nof California (1990). Without his knowledge or consent,\nUniversity of Southern California research physicians developed a\ncommercial cell line from tissue removed from leukemia patient John\nMoore. Moore and an appellate court argued that in taking his\nDNA-laden tissue for unrevealed research and development purposes\nunrelated to Moore\u2019s cancer care, UCLA doctors had appropriated\nMoore\u2019s identity in a manner analogous to advertisers using a\nperson\u2019s photograph without consent for commercial gain.\nMoore\u2019s privacy claim was novel at the time, but the claims of\ncelebrities and others to control the attributes of their personal\nidentities\u2014likenesses, voices, names, monikers, trademarks, and\nSocial Security numbers\u2014are commonly styled as privacy rights\nand have been since the early 20th century. John\nMoore\u2019s privacy claim was not successful in court. The\nCalifornia court held that Moore\u2019s doctors ought to have\nobtained his informed consent; but the court was unwilling to\ncommodify human tissue or DNA as private property (Radin 1987). Nor\ndid the court think Moore\u2019s injury fit the mold of traditional\ninvasions of privacy recognized in the law. In a related case that did\nnot result in tort litigation in her lifetime, cells taken from\nBaltimore resident Henrietta Lacks were the basis of an important\nimmortal cell line, HeLa. Lacks died in 1951, but the cell line\ncreated using her cervical cancer cells without her knowledge or\nconsent lives on. It has been used in the treatment and eradication of\nnumerous conditions and illnesses, including polio, without any\nfinancial reward to her or her heirs.\n\nBut proprietary understandings of privacy continue to find expression\nin health care and health research contexts. Scholars suggest that\nindividuals have privacy interests in their genes, genomes and\nbio-banked tissue specimens. These are sources of health information\nthat reflect what individuals and their biological families are like,\nand what will become of them. Since most people share a DNA profile\nwith no one other than an identical twin, a person\u2019s DNA is\nvirtually a unique personal identifier. The interest individuals have\nin controlling the use of their data and specimens can be reconciled\nwith researchers\u2019 needs for genotypical and phenotypical data,\nwhere principles of informed consent are honored (Presidential\nCommission 2012). Many people are now willing to voluntarily share\ngenetic data without personal gain. The United States National\nInstitutes of Health \u201cAll of Us\u201d project sought to enroll\none million American volunteers of diverse backgrounds into a research\nprogram requiring that they share medical and genetic data to help\naccelerate the search for disease cures and treatments.\n\nInfertility medicine is a growing field, one dependent upon gamete\ndonation and cryopreservation of embryos. Individuals have asserted\nwhat they describe as \u201cprivacy\u201d interests in controlling\nthe fate of gametes, zygotes, and frozen embryos. The privacy\ninterests debated in the context of infertility medicine are twofold:\na decisional privacy interest in the decision to bear a child with the\nhelp of reproductive technologies, and a proprietary privacy interest\nin controlling the fate of the building blocks of human life and the\nearliest beginnings of human life, created as a consequence of\none\u2019s intentions or the use of one\u2019s genetic materials.\nWhile many courts have rejected viewing frozen embryos as property,\nthey have struggled over how to allocate rights over embryos in cases\nof separation, divorce, death, moves and changes of heart.\n\nIn an entirely different vein, government regulators and the general\npublic characterize identity theft as a \u201cprivacy\u201d problem\n(Allen 2011). In recent years identify theft has become a privacy\nproblem in the delivery of health care. Because of the high price of\nhealth care, medical identity theft\u2014receiving medical care using\nothers\u2019 personal data for billing purposes\u2014has become a\nserious problem. Consumers must worry both about the confidentiality\nof their medical records and physician encounters, and about the\npossibility that someone will appropriate their personal identifiers\nand then use them to defraud health care providers and insurers.\n",
