    "main_text": "What is Conservation Biology? || Systematic Conservation Planning\n2.3 Systematic Conservation Planning\n\nThough the types of models we have just discussed have an important\nplace in the conservation biology and its history, it has become an\nexplicitly socio-ecological discipline in which sophisticated\ncomputational tools are used for the purpose of designing conservation\narea networks (see entry on\n social choice theory).\n From work involving population genetics and ecology for population\nviability analysis and the equilibrium model of MacArthur and Wilson,\nwith the associated SLOSS debate, we see a discipline transformed.\nWork on the genetics of inbreeding, habitat fragmentation,\nmetapopulation dynamics, and so on continues but in the guise of\nsomething more social; namely, systematic conservation planning (SCP)\n(Margules & Pressey 2000; Margules & Sarkar 2007; Watson et\nal. 2011). SCP involves a variety of steps including the\nfollowing:\n\n\n\nChoose and delimit the planning region.\n\n\nIdentify all stakeholders.\n\n\nCompile and assess all data.\n\n\nTreat data and construct models as necessary.\n\n\nIdentify and evaluate biodiversity constituents and\nsurrogates.\n\n\nSet explicit biodiversity goals and targets.\n\n\nReview existing conservation areas for performance with respect to\ntargets.\n\n\nPrioritize additional areas for conservation management.\n\n\nAssess biodiversity constituent and selected area\nvulnerabilities.\n\n\nRefine the network of selected areas.\n\n\nCarry out multi-criteria analysis.\n\n\nImplement conservation plan.\n\n\nMonitor network performance (Sarkar 2012: 100\u20133)\n\n\nThere are a variety of philosophical questions that are raised by SCP.\nFirst, who are the stakeholders in determining the boundaries of the\nanalysis, what are the relevant criteria to be used, and what is the\nfocal biotic unit? Second, what is biodiversity and what are the\nbiotic constituents we are trying to conserve and ensure persist?\nGiven problems with current definitions of \u2018biodiversity\u2019\nas we saw above, we must articulate what biodiversity constituents and\nsurrogates are, along with other diversity and persistence concepts.\nThird, given resource scarcity, efficiency is one of the goals of SCP,\nand thus how do we solve the minimum area and maximum representation\nproblems mentioned above? What is striking is how much the discipline\nincludes over and above models like the Lande metapopulation and\nMacArthur and Wilson equilibrium models. As Sahotra Sarkar writes,\n\n\nThus, in conservation biology, like computer science and unlike most\nof ecology, theoretical research consists of devising algorithms\nrather than formulating models and theories. In fact, because a\nvariety of algorithms can be used to solve these problems, a lot of\ntheoretical debate in conservation biology has been about the choice\nof algorithms. (Sarkar 2012: 124)\n\n\nWe have seen the role of place prioritization, which is key to SCP. We\nnext consider one other formal tool that is used to help make\ndecisions about how to accommodate different values in choosing\nconservation area networks.\n\nOne way to represent values would to be treat them as preferences\nusing the tools of neoclassical economics. Ideally we would reduce\nthese values to a single scale via a utility function. However, this\nis possible only if these values are commensurable (orderable on\nsingle scale). Some have argued that not all values can be so ordered.\nFor example, suppose you have to decide whether to be a lawyer or\nclarinetist (Raz 1986: 342). Neither seems better than the other and\nthey do not seem to be of equal value. Thus, we cannot rank them on a\nsingle scale. Nevertheless, if values are commensurable and we can\nmeasure them through people\u2019s willingness-to-pay for them or\nwillingness-to-be compensated for their loss, then they can be\nrepresented by a utility function. Multi-criteria analysis does not\nmake these two assumptions (Arrow & Raynaud 1986). Rather, the\npreferred method is determining a set of non-dominated alternatives\n(Moffett & Sarkar 2006). Suppose have a set of criteria \\(K =\n\\{\\kappa_i \\mid i = 1, 2,\\ldots, n\\}\\) and a set of feasible\nalternatives \\(A = \\{\\alpha_j \\mid j = 1, 2,\\ldots, m\\}\\) (for\ndetails, see Sarkar 2005: 196\u2013203). We will further assume that\neach criterion \\(\\kappa_i\\) induces a weak linear order \\(\\leq^*\\) on\n\\(A\\); that is, for any two \\(\\alpha_m, \\alpha_n \\in A, \\alpha_m\n\\leq_i^* \\alpha_n\\) or \\(\\alpha_n \\leq_i^* \\alpha_m\\) or both. Let\n\\(w_{im}\\) be the value of the \\(m\\)th alternative according to the\n\\(i\\)th criterion. We can say then that an alternative \\(\\alpha_m \\in\nA\\) is non-dominated by another alternative \\(\\alpha_n \\in\nA\\) with respect to \\(K\\) if, and only if: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\exists p, k_p \\in K \\textrm{ such that } \\  w_{pn} \\lt w_{pm}\\\\\n\\forall q, k_q \\in K, w_{qn} \\leq w_{qm}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nThis implies that \\(\\alpha_n\\) is strictly better than \\(\\alpha_m\\) by\nat least one criterion in \\(k_p \\in K\\), and it not worse than\n\\(\\alpha_m\\) by any criterion \\(k_i \\in K\\). An alternative \\(\\alpha_i\n\\in A\\) is non-dominated if, and only if, it is not dominated\nby any other element of \\(A\\). Thus, using multi-criteria analysis, we\nattempt to find a non-dominated set of alternatives from which to\ndesign conservation area networks. An example from Sarkar (2012:\n204\u20136) is briefly considered. We begin with place prioritization\nwith 100 attempts to create a prioritized lists of hexagons for a\ntarget of 10 representatives for each vertebrate species present in\nTexas. There were thirty-two feasible solutions\u2014ones that\nsatisfied the conservation target. However, two other criteria were\nused for multi-criteria analysis, economic cost and social cost. The\nfirst was estimated by the cost of the conservation plan per hexagon\nand the second was estimated by the human population size of each\nhexagon included. From the thirty-two feasible solutions, there were\nonly two non-dominated solutions selected by the multi-criteria\nanalysis.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Place prioritization and\nmulti-criteria analysis in Texas (Sarkar 2012: 206)\n\n\nNext we reflect on the case studies and then ask what exactly is\nconservation biology?\n",
