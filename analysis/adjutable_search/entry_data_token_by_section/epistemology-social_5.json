    "main_text": "Central Topics in Social Epistemology || Group Belief\n3.3 Group Belief\n\nThe cases discussed thus far focus on epistemic agents who are\nindividuals. What makes them topics of social epistemology is that\nthey involve agents interacting in the course of belief-formation,\nwhere this interaction bears on the epistemic status of one or more of\ntheir beliefs. The cases we will now consider involve not individual\nagents but rather groups that appear to act as collective epistemic\nsubjects. When we speak of collective epistemic subjects, we have in\nmind collections of individuals which constitute a group to which\nactions, intentions, and/or representational states, including\nbeliefs, are ascribed. Such collections might include juries, panels,\ngovernments, assemblies, teams, etc.\n\nSocial epistemologists have addressed various questions concerning the\nnature of such \u201ccollective\u201d subjects, of which we\nhighlight the two most salient ones. First, under what conditions can\na group be said to believe something? (Here social epistemology has\nborrowed extensively from extant discussions of this question in\nphilosophy of mind, action theory, and social and political\nphilosophy). Second, given a case in which a group believes something,\nunder what conditions does this belief count as epistemically\njustified (or amount to knowledge)? We consider this latter question\nbelow in section 3.4.\n\nLet us begin with the question about group belief. Two main views have\ndominated the discussion: Summativism and Non-Summativism (or\nCollectivism). According to Summativism about group belief, group\nbelief is a function of the beliefs of its members. On a simple\nversion, a group believes something just in case all, or almost all,\nof its members hold the belief (Quinton 1976: 17). Since Summativism\nconstrues claims asserting group beliefs as merely summarizing claims\nabout the beliefs of the individuals who make up the group, this view\nis popular among those who worry about the \u201cmetaphysics\u201d\nof group agents.\n\nNon-summativist or \u201cCollectivist\u201d accounts of group belief\nare motivated by objections to Summativism. Margaret Gilbert objects\nthat it is common in ordinary language to ascribe a belief to a group\nwithout assuming that most or all members hold the belief in question.\nOn this basis, she advances a Non-Summativist account of group belief\nbased on the notion of joint commitment, according to which:\n\n\nA group G believes that p if and only if the members\nof G are jointly committed to believe that\np as a body.\n\n\nJoint commitments create normative requirements for group members to\nemulate a single believer. On Gilbert\u2019s account, the commitment\nto act this way is common knowledge, and if group members do not act\naccordingly they can be held normatively responsible by their peers\nfor failing to do so (see Gilbert 1987, 1989, 2004; see also Tuomela\n1992, Schmitt 1994a, and Tollefsen 2015 for variations on this\ntheme).\n\nWhile joint commitment accounts of group belief are popular, they are\nnot beyond criticism. One worry is that they focus on responsibility\nto peers, and not on the belief-states of the group members. On this\nbasis Wray (2001) suggests that they should be considered accounts of\ngroup acceptance instead. Another worry is that joint commitment\naccounts fail to recognize that there can be various reasons for joint\ncommitment, not all of which are reflective of group belief (Lackey\n2021).\n\nA different Collectivist approach is taken by Alexander Bird (2014,\n2022) who contends that the joint acceptance model of group belief is\nonly one of many different (but legitimate) models. For instance, he\nintroduces the \u201cdistributed model\u201d to deal with systems\nthat feature information-intensive tasks which cannot be processed by\na single individual. Several individuals must gather different pieces\nof information while others coordinate this information and use it to\ncomplete the task. (See also Hutchins 1995.) Bird contends that this\nis a fairly standard type of group model that occurs in science. (See\nalso Brown 2023 for a variant on this position, motivated by\nfunctionalism about the propositional attitudes.)\n\nAn interestingly \u201chybrid\u201d account of group belief is that\nof Lackey (2021), who adopts what she terms the \u201cGroup\nAgent\u201d account. According to it,\n\n\nA group, G, believes that p if and only if: (1) there is a significant\npercentage of G\u2019s operative members who believe that p, and (2)\nare such that adding together the basis of their beliefs that p yields\na belief set that is not substantively incoherent. (2021: 49)\n\n\nWhile (1) is a Summativist condition, (2), which is meant to avoid\nascribing belief to a group when its members\u2019 reasons cannot be\ncoherently combined, is a normative requirement that governs the\ncollective itself. The account is thus Summativist without being\nreductive.\n3.5 Group Justification\n\nUntil this point, we have only looked at the phenomenon of group\nbelief itself. We have not yet considered how such beliefs can be\nevaluated from the epistemic point of view \u2014 that is, how such\nbelief can be evaluated as to whether it is justified, reasonable,\nwarranted, rational, knowledgeable, etc. In this section we explore\nthis question by focusing on the conditions under which a\ngroup\u2019s belief is justified.\n\nIf the government of the United States were to believe that global\nwarming presents significant environmental challenges, we might say it\nwas justified in doing so because of the overwhelming consensus of\nclimate scientists to this effect. Under what conditions can we say\nthat the belief of a group is justified?\n\nSchmitt (1994a: 265) held that a group belief is justified only if\nevery member of the group has a justified belief to the same effect.\nBut this seems to make group justification too hard to come by (Lackey\n2016: 249\u2013250). Goldman (2014) defended a Process Reliabilist\naccount of group justification. The basic idea of Process Reliabilism\nis to construe justification in terms of the reliable production of\ntrue belief, where this is understood to involve (i) a cognitive\nprocess that reliably produces true belief, or else (ii) a cognitive\nprocess (such as drawing an inference) that takes beliefs as\ninputs and which reliably produces true beliefs when its inputs are\njustified (Goldman 1979). Goldman (2014) proposes to treat group\njustification in analogous terms. Starting with the requirement that\nthe group\u2019s belief be caused by a type of belief-forming process\nthat takes inputs from member beliefs in some proposition and outputs\na group belief in that proposition, his idea is to model group\njustification along the lines of (ii). A type of process that\nexemplifies this feature might be a majoritarian process in which\nmember beliefs (of the group) are aggregated into a group belief. Such\na process is likely to produce a true belief when its inputs\u2014the\nindividual members\u2019 beliefs to the same effect\u2014are\njustified.\n\nLackey (2021) develops various criticisms of Goldman (2014) and\ndefends an alternative account of group justification on this basis.\nAccording to her alternative account, a group G justifiedly believes\nthat p if and only if (1) G believes that p [see 3.3 above for her\n\u201chybrid\u201d analysis of this] and\n\n\n(2) Full disclosure of the evidence relevant to the proposition that\np, accompanied by rational deliberation about that evidence among the\nmembers of G in accordance with their individual and group epistemic\nnormative requirements, would not result in further evidence that,\nwhen added to the bases of G\u2019s members\u2019 beliefs that p,\nyields a total belief set that fails to make sufficiently probable\nthat p. (2021: 97)\n\n\nAn alternative account of group justification can be found in Brown\n(2024). Like Goldman (2014), Brown appeals to the testimony of group\nmembers in its account of group justification, but unlike Goldman,\nBrown\u2019s account does not require the beliefs expressed in these\ntestimonies to be justified in order for the group\u2019s belief to\nbe justified. In this way, Brown argues, her account is not\nsusceptible to the objections Lackey (2021) raises against Goldman\n(2014).\n4. Formal Approaches to Social Epistemology\n\nWe have now seen some of the problems that face those who develop\naccounts of knowledge acquisition within a community. In recent years\nphilosophers have turned to formal methods to understand some of these\nsocial aspects of belief and knowledge formation. There are broadly\ntwo approaches in this vein. The first comes from the field of formal\nepistemology, which mostly uses proof-based methods to consider\nquestions that mostly originate within individual-focused\nepistemology. Some work in this field, though, considers questions\nrelated to, for example, judgment aggregation and testimony. The\nsecond approach, sometimes dubbed \u201cformal social\nepistemology,\u201d stems largely from philosophy of science, where\nresearchers have employed modeling methods to understand the workings\nof epistemic communities. While much of this work has been motivated\nby a desire to understand the workings of science, it is often widely\napplicable to social aspects of belief formation.\n\nAnother distinction between these traditions is that while formal\nepistemologists tend to focus on questions related to ideal belief\ncreation, such as what constitutes rationality, formal social\nepistemologists have been more interested in explaining real human\nbehavior, and designing good knowledge-creation systems. We will now\nbriefly discuss relevant work from formal epistemology, and then look\nat three topics in formal social epistemology.\n4.1 Formal Epistemology in the Social Realm\n\nAs mentioned, formal epistemology has mostly focused on issues related\nto individual epistemology. This said, there is a significant portion\nof this literature addressing questions including 1) how should a\ngroup aggregate their judgements? 2) how should a group aggregate\ntheir (more fine-grained) beliefs? 3) how should Bayesians update on\nthe testimony of others? and 4) what sorts of aggregation methods\ncreate rational or effective groups?\n\nLet\u2019s start with judgement aggregation. Judgement aggregation\nassumes that individuals in a group hold binary opinions or attitudes\non some matters. These could be factual like \u201cdefendant X is\ninnocent\u201d or actionable like \u201cwe should get Chinese food\ntonight.\u201d The question is then how the group should aggregate\nthese judgements to facilitate group action. Or: how can individually\nrational judgements be combined into a rationally judging group?\n\nA sticky problem that emerges is the \u201cdoctrinal paradox,\u201d\noriginally formulated by Kornhauser and Sager (1986) in the context of\nlegal judgments. Suppose that a court consisting of three judges must\nrender a judgment. The group judgment is to be based on each of three\nrelated propositions, where the first two propositions are premises\nand the third the conclusion. For example:\n\nThe defendant was legally obliged not to do a certain action.\nThe defendant did do that action.\nThe defendant is liable for breach of contract.\n\n\nLegal doctrine entails that obligation and action are jointly\nnecessary and sufficient for liability. That is, conclusion (3) is\ntrue if and only if the two preceding premises are each true. Suppose,\nhowever, as shown in the table below, that the three judges form the\nindicated beliefs, vote accordingly, and the judgment-aggregation\nfunction delivers a conclusion guided by majority rule.\n\n\n\n \nObligation?\nAction?\nLiable? \n\nJudge 1\nTrue\nTrue\nTrue \n\nJudge 2\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse \n\nJudge 3\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse \n\nGroup\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse  \n\n\nIn this example, each of the three judges has a logically\nself-consistent set of beliefs. Moreover, a majority aggregation\nfunction seems eminently reasonable. Nonetheless, the upshot is that\nthe court\u2019s judgments are jointly inconsistent.\n\nThis kind of problem arises easily when a judgment is made by multiple\nmembers of a collective entity. This led a number of authors, starting\nwith List and Pettit (2002), to prove impossibility theorems in which\nreasonable-looking combinations of constraints were nonetheless shown\nto be jointly unsatisfiable in judgment aggregation. Further\ngeneralizations are due to Pauly and van Hees 2006, Dietrich 2006, and\nMongin 2008. These results reflect Arrow\u2019s famous impossibility\ntheorem for preference aggregation (Arrow 1951/1963).\n\nIn light of these results, various \u201cescape routes\u201d have\nbeen proposed. List and Pettit (2011) offer ways to relax requirements\nso that majority voting, for example, satisfies collective\nrationality. Briggs et al. (2014) argue that it may be too strong to\nrequire that entities always have logically consistent beliefs.\nFollowing Joyce (1998), they introduce a weaker notion of coherence of\nbeliefs. They show that the majority voting aggregation of logically\nconsistent beliefs will always be coherent, and the aggregation of\ncoherent beliefs will typically be coherent as well.\n\nSome apply the theory of judgment aggregation to the increasingly\ncommon problem of how collaborating scientific authors should decide\nwhat statements to endorse. Solomon (2006), for instance, argues that\nvoting might help scientists avoid \u201cgroupthink\u201d arising\nfrom group deliberation. While Wray (2014) defends deliberation as\ncrucial to the production of group consensus, Bright et al. (2018)\npoint out that consensus is not always necessary (or possible) in\nscientific reporting. In such cases, they argue, majority voting is a\ngood way to decide what statements a report will endorse, even if\nthere is disagreement in the group.\n\nRather than focusing on the aggregation of judgements, we might,\ninstead, consider aggregating degrees of belief, or\n\u201ccredences.\u201d These are numbers between 0 and 1\nrepresenting an agent\u2019s degree of certainty in a statement. (For\ninstance, if I think there is a 90% chance it is raining, my credence\nthat it is raining is .9.) This representation changes the question of\njudgement aggregation to something like this: if a group of people\nhold different individual credences, what should the group credence\nbe?\n\nThis ends up being very closely related to the question of how an\nindividual ought to update their credences upon learning the credences\nof others. If a rational group ought to adopt some aggregated belief,\nthen it might also make sense for an individual in the group to adopt\nthe same belief as a result of learning about the credences of their\npeers. In other words, the problems of belief aggregation, peer\ndisagreement, and testimony are entangled in this literature. (Though\nsee Easwaran et al. (2016) for a discussion of distinctions between\nthese issues.) We\u2019ll focus here on belief aggregation.\n\nIn principle, there are many ways that one can go about aggregating\ncredences or pooling opinions (Genest and Zidek 1986). A simple option\nis to combine opinions by linear pooling\u2014taking a weighted\naverage of credences. This averaging could respect all credences\nequally, or put extra weights on the opinions of, say, recognized\nexperts. This option has some nice properties, such as preserving\nunanimous agreement, and allowing groups to aggregate over different\ntopics independently (DeGroot 1974; Lehrer and Wagner 1981). Despite\nsome issues which will be described shortly, it is defended by many in\nformal epistemology as the best way to combine credences (Moss 2011,\nPettigrew 2019b).\n\nIn thinking about ideal knowledge creation though, we might ask how a\nBayesian (i.e., an individual who rationally holds to ideals\nof credence updating) should update credences in light of peer\ndisagreement or how a group of Bayesians should aggregate beliefs. A\nBayesian will not simply average across beliefs, except under\nparticular assumptions or in special cases (Genest and Zidek 1986;\nBradley 2007; Steele 2012; Russell et al. 2015). And a group that\nengages in linear averaging of this sort can typically be Dutch\nbooked, meaning they will accept a series of bets guaranteed to lose\nthem money.\n\nA fully-fledged Bayesian approach to aggregation demands that final\ncredences be derived by Bayesian updating in light of the opinions\nheld by each group member (Keeney and Raiffa 1993). Notice, this is\nalso what a Bayesian individual should do to update on the credences\nof others. To do this properly, though, is very complicated. It\nrequires prior probabilities about what obtains in the world, as well\nas probabilities about how likely each group member is to develop\ntheir credences in light of what might obtain in world. This will not\nbe practical in real cases.\n\nInstead, many approaches consider features that are desirable for\nrational aggregation, and then ask which simpler aggregation rules\nsatisfy them. For instance, one thing a rational aggregation method\nshould do (to prevent Dutch booking) is yield the same credence\nregardless of whether information is obtained before or after\naggregating. For instance, if we all have credences about the rain,\nand someone comes in wearing shorts, it should not matter to the final\ngroup output whether 1) they entered and we all updated our credences\n(in a Bayesian way) and then aggregated them, or 2) we aggregated our\ncredences, they entered, and we updated the aggregated credence (in a\nBayesian way). Geometric methods, which take the geometric average of\nprobabilities over worlds, yield this desirable property (and\nother desirable properties) in many cases (Genest 1984; Dietrich and\nList 2016, Russell et al. 2015, Baccelli & Stewart 2023). These\nmethods proceed by multiplying (weighted) credences over worlds that\nmight obtain and then renormalizing them to sum to 1.\n\nOne thing that geometric averaging does not do, though, is allow for\ncredences over different propositions to be aggregated completely\nindependently from each other. (This is something often treated as a\ndesideratum for judgment aggregation.) For instance, our beliefs about\nthe probabilities of hail might influence how we will aggregate our\nbeliefs over the probabilities of rain. Instead, a more holistic\napproach to aggregation is required. This is an important lesson for\napproaches to social epistemology which focus on individual topics of\ninterest in addressing peer disagreement and testimony (Russell et al.\n2015).\n\nAnother thing that some take to be strange about geometric averaging\nis that it sometimes will aggregate identical credences to a different\ngroup credence. For instance, we might all have credence .7 that it is\nraining, but our group credence might be .9. Easwaran et al. (2016)\nargue, though, that this often makes sense when updating on the\ncredences of others\u2014their confidence should make us\nmore confident (see also Christensen 2009). In light of critiques of\nboth geometric and linear averaging, Kinney (2022) argues that\nattention should be paid to the underlying models of the world that\nindividuals are working from when combining credences. He advocates\nfor an aggregation method using \u201cmodel stacking\u201d a la Le\nand Clarke (2017). A general take-away is that although the question\nof rational credence aggregation might initially sound trivial, this\nis very far from the reality. There are deep and enduring questions\nabout what a rational group consists in.\n\nThe question of whether aggregated credences can be more extreme than\nindividual ones echoes much earlier work bearing on the question: are\ngroups smart? In 1785, the Marquis de Condorcet wrote an essay proving\nthe following. Suppose a group of individuals form independent beliefs\nabout a topic and they are each more than 50% likely to reach a\ncorrect judgement. If they take a majority vote, the group is more\nlikely to vote correctly the larger it gets (in the limit this\nlikelihood approaches 1). This result, now known as the\n\u201cCondorcet Jury Theorem,\u201d underlies what is sometimes\ncalled the \u201cwisdom of the crowds\u201d: in the right conditions\ncombining the knowledge of many can be very effective. Many have drawn\non this result to think about the rationality of group reasoning and\ndecision making.\n\nIn many cases, though, real groups are prone to epistemic problems\nwhen it comes to combining beliefs. Consider the phenomenon of\ninformation cascades, first identified by Bikhchandani et al. (1992).\nTake a group of agents who almost all have private information that\nNissan stock is better than GM stock. The first agent buys GM stock\nbased on their (minority) private information. The second agent has\ninformation that Nissan is better, but on the basis of this observed\naction updates their belief to think GM is likely better. They also\nbuy GM stock. The third agent now sees that two peers purchased GM and\nlikewise updates their beliefs to prefer GM stock. This sets off a\ncascade of GM buying among observers who, without social information,\nwould have bought Nissan. The problem here is a lack of independence\nin the \u201cvote\u201d\u2014each individual is influenced by the\nbeliefs and actions of the previous individuals in a way that obscures\nthe presence of private information. In updating on the credences of\nothers, we thus may need to be careful to take into account that they\nmight already have updated on the credences of others.\n4.2 The Credit Economy\n\nLet us now turn to three paradigms in formal social epistemology: the\ncredit economy, network models, and models of epistemic diversity.\n\nA key realization, due initially to sociologist of science Robert\nMerton, is that scientists often seek credit\u2014a proxy\nfor recognition and approbation of one\u2019s scientific work, along\nwith all the attendant benefits (Merton 1973). Credit economy models\ndraw on game and decision theory to model scientists as rational\ncredit seekers, and then assess the epistemic impacts of the credit\nincentives scientists face. At the heart of much of this work is a\ndebate going back as far as Du Bois (1898) that asks: what is the best\nmotive for an epistemic community? Is it credit seeking or\n\u201cpure\u201d truth seeking? Or some combination of the two?\n\nPhilip Kitcher\u2019s 1990 paper \u201cThe Division of Cognitive\nLabor\u201d argues that scientists divide labor more effectively when\nthey are motivated by credit. Truth seekers might all herd onto the\nmost promising problem in science, while credit seekers will choose\nless popular topics where they are more likely to be the one\ngenerating a finding. Strevens (2003) extends Kitcher\u2019s work by\narguing that an existing feature of credit incentives, the priority\nrule, can lead to an even better division of labor. This is the rule\nwhich stipulates that credit will be allocated only to the scientist\nwho first makes a discovery. Zollman (2018) critiques both of these\nmodels, though, by pointing out that pure truth seekers should be\nhappy if anyone makes new discoveries (while Kitcher and Strevens\nassume that \u201ctruth seekers\u201d are only motivated to find\ntruth themselves). If scientists do not care who makes a discovery,\nthen credit is not needed to motivate division of labor.\n\nOthers point out that the priority rule has its downsides. Higginson\nand Munafo (2016) and Romero (2017) argue that the priority rule\nstrongly disincentivizes scientists from performing replications\nbecause credit is so strongly associated with new, positive findings.\nReplications are often crucial in determining whether new results are\naccurate. Another worry is that the priority rule incentivizes fraud\nand/or sloppy work by those who want to quickly claim credit (Merton\n1973, Casadevall and Fang 2012). Both Zollman (2022\u2014see Other\nInternet Resources) and Heesen (2021) show how fraud can positively\nimpact a scientist\u2019s credit in light of the priority rule. And\nHigginson and Munafo (2016) and Heesen (2018) show that on the\nrealistic assumption that speed of production trades off with quality,\nthe priority rule incentivizes fast, poor, sloppy science. Bright\n(2017a), though, uses a model to point out that credit-seekers who\nfear retaliation may publish more accurate results than truth-seekers\nwho are convinced of some fact, despite their experimental results to\nthe contrary. In other words, a true believer may be just as\nincentivized to commit fraud as someone who simply seeks approval from\ntheir community.\n\nThere is one more worry about the priority rule, which regards unfair\nscientific rewards and their consequences. Merton (1968) described the\n\u201cMatthew Effect,\u201d that pre-eminent scholars often get more\ncredit for work than less famous ones. Strevens (2006) argues that\nthis follows the scientific norm to reward credit based on the benefit\na discovery yields to science and society. Because famous scientists\nare more trusted, their discoveries do more good. Heesen (2017), on\nthe other hand, uses a credit economy model to show how someone who\ngets credit early on due to luck may later accrue more and more credit\nbecause of the Matthew effect. When this kind of compounding luck\nhappens, he argues, the resulting stratification of credit in a\nscientific community does not improve inquiry. Rubin and Schneider\n(2021) and Rubin (2022) add to these worries with network models\nshowing how older, more connected member of the community will tend to\nget unfair credit in cases of multiple discovery as a result of the\ndynamics of information sharing. As they argue, these dynamics will\noften unfairly advantage dominant social groups who tend to be more\nestablished and connected in science.\n\nOn the positive side, besides possible benefits to division of labor,\nthe priority rule incentivizes sharing in science. The communist norm\nstates that scientists will share work promptly and widely, which\nbenefits scientists because they want to establish priority and\nreceive credit. While models show how scientists can be incentivized\nto hide intermediate research to get later credit (Dasgupta and David\n1994), they also show how enough credit can promote communism\n(Banerjee et al. 2014, Heesen 2017b).\n\nThis debate is further complicated by models that look at how credit\ninfluences not just rational decision making, but selective processes\nin science. Credit can impact who remains in a discipline, whose\npractices and ideas become influential, and whose students get jobs.\nSmaldino and McElreath (2016) show how poor methods (like low study\npower) tend to generate false positives and thus credit for those\nusing them. If investigators using these poor methods train their\nstudents into them, and then place those students disproportionately,\nthey will tend to proliferate. Likewise Tiokhin et al. (2021) show how\nselection can drive the proliferation of fast work (using small\nsamples sizes) and O\u2019Connor (2019) shows how it can lead to\nconservative, safe problem choice in science. Others, like Smaldino et\nal. (2019) and Stewart and Plotkin (2021) consider what conditions\nmight promote the selection of good science in light of selection.\n\nAs we have seen, credit economy models help answer questions like:\nwhat is the best credit structure for an epistemic community? And how\ndo we promote true discoveries via incentive systems? As credit\neconomy models show us, designing good epistemic communities is by no\nmeans a trivial task.\n4.3 Epistemic Networks\n\nAnother paradigm, widely used by philosophers to explore social\naspects of epistemology, are epistemic network models. This kind of\nmodel uses networks to explicitly represent social or informational\nties where beliefs, evidence, and testimony can be shared.\n\nThere are different ways to do this. In the social sciences generally,\na popular approach takes a \u201cdiffusion\u201d or\n\u201ccontagion\u201d view of beliefs. A belief or idea is\ntransmitted from individual to individual across their network\nconnections, much like a virus can be transmitted (Rogers 1962). (See\nLacroix et al 2021 for a use of this sort of model in philosophy.)\nAlternatively, agents can start with credences and in successive\nrounds average those credences with their neighbors until reaching a\nsteady state (Golub and Jackson 2010, 2012).\n\nIn these diffusion/contagion models, though, the individuals do not\ngather evidence from the world, share evidence with each other, or\nform beliefs in any sort of rational way. For this reason,\nphilosophers of science have tended to use the network\nepistemology framework introduced by economists Bala and Goyal\n(1998) to model how more rational individuals learn from neighbors.\nThese models start with a collection of agents on a network, who\nchoose from some set of actions or action guiding theories. Agents\nhave beliefs about which action is best, and change these beliefs in\nlight of the evidence they gather from their actions. In addition,\nthey also update on evidence gathered by neighbors in the network,\ntypically using some version of Bayes\u2019 rule. It is in this sense\nthat agents are part of an epistemic community. Figure 1 shows what\nthis might look like. The numbers next to each agent represent their\ndegree of belief in some proposition like \u201cvaccines are\nsafe.\u201d The black agents think this is more likely than not. As\nthis model progresses these agents gather data, which increases their\nneighbors\u2019 degrees of belief in turn.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Agents in a network\nepistemology model use their credences to guide theory testing. Their\nresults change their credences, and those of their neighbors. [An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nCommunities in this model can develop beliefs that the better theory\n(vaccines are safe) is indeed better, or else they can pre-emptively\nsettle on the worse theory (vaccines cause autism) as a result of\nmisleading evidence. Generally, since networks of agents are sensitive\nto the evidence they gather, they are more likely to figure out the\n\u201ctruth\u201d of which is best (Zollman 2013; Rosenstock et al.\n2017).\n\nZollman (2007, 2010) describes what has now been dubbed the\n\u201cZollman effect\u201d in these models; the surprising\nobservation that it is generically worse for communities to\ncommunicate more (see also, Grim 2009). In tightly connected networks,\nmisleading evidence is widely shared, and may cause the community to\npre-emptively settle on a poor theory. Others find similar results for\ndiverse features of networks that slow consensus and promote diversity\nof investigation, including irrational stubbornness (Zollman 2010,\nFrey and Seselja 2020, Gabriel and O\u2019Connor 2023), using grant\ngiving strategies to promote diversity (Kummerfeld and Zollman 2020,\nWu and O\u2019Connor 2022), and demographic diversity (Wu 2022,\nFazelpour and Steel 2022).\n\nOn the basis of results like these Mayo-Wilson et al. (2011, 2013)\ndefend the \u201cindependence thesis\u201d\u2014that rational\ngroups may be composed of irrational individuals, and rational\nindividuals may constitute irrational groups. This supports central\nclaims from social epistemology espoused by Goldman (1999). Smart\n(2018) calls one direction of this claim\u2014that sometimes\nindividual cognitive vices can improve group performance\u2014\n\u201cMandevillian intelligence.\u201d\n\nOthers have considered how else cognitive biases might impact the\ndevelopment of consensus in these models. Weatherall and\nO\u2019Connor (2018) and Mohseni and Williams (2019) show how\nconformity can prevent the adoption of successful beliefs, or slow\nthis adoption, because agents who conform to their neighbors are often\nunwilling to pass on good information that goes against the grain.\nBoth Olsson (2013) and O\u2019Connor and Weatherall (2018) consider\nnetwork models where actors instead place less trust in the evidence\n(or testimony) of those who do not share their beliefs. This can lead\nto stable, polarized camps that each ignore evidence and testimony\ncoming from the other camp.\n\nThese latter models relate to other work attempting to show how\npolarization might arise in epistemic communities not from biases, but\nfrom more rational forms of updating. Singer et al. (2019) show how\nagents who exchange reasons for beliefs, but reject reasons that do\nnot cohere with their beliefs, can polarize. Jern et al. (2014) show\nhow actors who hold causally or probabilistically related beliefs can\npolarize in light of the same new evidence. This observation is\nextended and explored by Freeborn (2023a) and Freeborn (2023b) who\nconsiders how networks of agents who share information and hold\nmultiple beliefs can polarize and factionalize. Dorst (2023) provides\na model where mostly rational agents can polarize in response to the\nsame evidence, and in ways that are predictable.\n\nOther literature investigates the role of pernicious influencers,\nespecially from industry, on epistemic communities. Holman and Bruner\n(2015) develop a network model where one agent shares only fraudulent\nevidence meant to support an inferior theory. As they show, this agent\ncan keep a network from reaching successful consensus by muddying the\nwater with misleading data. Holman and Bruner (2017) show how industry\ncan shape the output of a community through \u201cindustrial\nselection\u201d\u2014funding only agents whose methods bias them\ntowards preferred findings. Weatherall et al. (2020) and Lewandowsky\net al. (2019) show how a propagandist can mislead public agents simply\nby sharing a biased sample of the real results produced in an\nepistemic network. Together these papers give insight into how\nstrategies that do not involve fraud can shape scientific research and\nmislead the public.\n\nOne truth about epistemic communities is that relationships matter.\nThese are the ties that ground testimony, disagreement, and trust.\nEpistemic network models allow philosophers to explore processes of\ninfluence in social networks, yield insights into why social ties\nmatter to the way communities form beliefs, and think about how to\ncreate better knowledge systems.\n4.4 Modeling Diversity in Epistemic Communities\n\nDiversity has emerged several times in our discussion of formal social\nepistemology. Credit incentives can encourage scientists to choose a\ndiversity of problems. In network models, a transient diversity of\nbeliefs is necessary for good inquiry. Let us now turn to models that\ntackle the influence of diversity more explicitly. It has been\nsuggested that cognitive diversity benefits epistemic communities\nbecause a group where members start with different assumptions, use\ndifferent methodologies, or reason in different ways may be more\nlikely to find truth.\n\nWeisberg and Muldoon (2009) introduce a model where actors investigate\nan \u201cepistemic landscape\u201d\u2014a grid where each section\nrepresents a problem in science, of varying epistemic importance.\nFigure 2 shows an example of such a landscape. Learners are randomly\nscattered on the landscape, and follow search rules that are sensitive\nto this importance. Investigators can then ask: how well did these\nlearners do? Did they fully search the landscape? Did they find the\npeaks? And: do communities with diverse search strategies outperform\ncommunities with uniform ones?\n\n\n\nFigure 2: An epistemic landscape.\nLocation represents problem choice, and height represents epistemic\nsignificance.\n\n\nWeisberg and Muldoon argue that a combination of\n\u201cfollowers\u201d (who work on problems similar to other\nindividuals) and \u201cmavericks\u201d (who prefer to explore new\nterrain) do better than either group alone; i.e., there is a benefit\nto cognitive diversity. Their modeling choices and main result have\nbeen convincingly criticized (Alexander et al. 2015; Thoma 2015;\nPoyh\u00f6nen 2017; Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto and Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto\n2018), but the framework has been co-opted by other philosophers to\nuseful ends. Thoma (2015) and Poyh\u00f6nen (2017), for instance, show\nthat in modified versions of the model, cognitive diversity indeed\nprovides the sort of benefit Weisberg and Muldoon hypothesize.\n\nHong and Page (2004) (and following work) use a simple model to derive\ntheir famous \u201cDiversity Trumps Ability\u201d result. Agents\nface a simple epistemic landscape \u2014 a ring with some number of\nlocations on it, each associated with a number representing its\ngoodness as a solution. An agent is represented as a finite set of\nintegers, such as \u27e83, 7, 10\u27e9. Such an agent is placed on the\nring, and can move to locations 3, 7, and 10 spots ahead of their\ncurrent position, assuming it improves their position. The central\nresult is that randomly selected groups of agents who tackle the task\ntogether tend to outperform groups created of top performers. This is\nbecause the top performers have similar integers, and thus gain\nrelatively little from group membership, whereas random agents have a\ngreater variety of integers. This result has been widely cited, though\nthere have been criticisms of the model either as insufficient to show\nsomething so complicated, as lacking crucial representational\nfeatures, or as failing to show what it claims (Thompson 2014; Singer\n2019).\n\nTo this point we have addressed cognitive diversity. But we might also\nbe interested in diversity of social identity in epistemic\ncommunities. Social diversity is an important source of cognitive\ndiversity, and for this reason can benefit the functioning of\nepistemic groups. For instance, different life histories and\nexperiences may lead individuals to hold different assumptions and\ntackle different research programs (Haraway 1989; Longino 1990;\nHarding 1991; Hong and Page 2004). If so, then we may want to know:\nwhy are some groups of people often excluded from epistemic\ncommunities like those in academia? And what might we do about\nthis?\n\nIn recent work, scholars have used models of bargaining to represent\nacademic collaboration. They have shown 1) how the emergence of\nbargaining norms across social identity groups can lead to\ndiscrimination with respect to credit sharing in collaboration (Bruner\nand O\u2019Connor 2017; O\u2019Connor and Bruner 2019) and 2) why\nthis may lead some groups to avoid academia, or else cluster in\ncertain subfields (Rubin and O\u2019Connor 2018). In addition, in the\ncredit-economy tradition, Bright (2017b) and Hengel (2022) provide\nmodels showing how women may be less productive if they reasonably\nexpect more stringent criticism of their work, and react\nrationally.\n\nAs we have seen in this section, models can help explain how and when\ncognitive diversity might matter to the production of knowledge by a\ncommunity. They can also tell us something about why epistemic\ncommunities often, nonetheless, fail to be diverse with respect to\nsocial identity.\n5. Social Epistemology and Society\n\nLet us now move on to see how topics from social epistemology\nintersect with important questions about the proper functioning of\ndemocratic societies, and questions about the dysfunctions in the\nsocial practices bound up in our quest for knowledge.\n5.1 The Social Epistemology of Democracies\n\nA good deal of social epistemology focuses on topics in political\nepistemology.\n\nA large portion of this work is devoted to evaluating the epistemic\nproperties of democratic institutions and practices, falling within\nwhat Alvin Goldman (2010) labeled \u201csystems-oriented\u201d\nsocial epistemology. By a \u201csystem\u201d he meant some entity\nwith various working components and multiple goals. System-oriented\nsocial epistemology asks how best to design systems whose goals\ninclude epistemic goods such as the production or distribution of\nknowledge or true belief. A number of theorists have pursued this\nresearch programme, examining various institutions in democratic\npolitical systems (see e.g. Zollman (2015), Fallis and Matheson\n(2019), O\u2019Connor and Weatherall (2019), Miller (2020), and\nFrost-Arnold (2021).)\n\nThe systems-oriented research programme in social epistemology has\nalso been brought to bear on more general questions regarding\ndemocratic politics. Elizabeth Anderson (2006), for example, addresses\nhow the epistemic properties of democratic systems can be designed to\nattain the best possible form of democracy. She provides three\nepistemic models of democracy: the Condorcet Jury Theorem, the\nDiversity Trumps Ability result, and John Dewey\u2019s\nexperimentalism. Anderson herself plumps for Dewey\u2019s\nexperimentalist approach, while several others argue for voting\naggregation and the Condorcet Jury Theorem (List and Goodin 2001;\nLandemore 2011), and Singer (2019) defends a version of diversity\ntrumps ability (albeit in connection with scientific teams). By\ncontrast, Claudio Lopez-Guerra (2010), H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Landemore\n(2013) and Alex Guerrero (2014) defend a lottery system for selecting\npolitical representatives, contending that the policies that would\nresult would be better than those arrived at through voting. (Estlund\n2008 rejects the core idea of systems-oriented social\nepistemology\u2014 that the epistemic goodness of democratic politics\nis to be sought in the quality of its outcomes\u2014arguing instead\nthat it should be sought in the legitimacy of its procedures.)\n\nPolitically-oriented social epistemologists have also written\nextensively on the epistemic properties of public deliberation. Since\nJohn Stuart Mill\u2019s On Liberty, there has been a long\nhistory of attempts to argue for free speech rights on epistemic\ngrounds. This discussion has continued, albeit with many recent\nauthors casting a more skeptical eye. Some, recognizing the pitfalls\nof deliberation under conditions of oppression, continue to defend the\nepistemic potential of deliberation to illuminate social problems\n(Young 2000; Anderson 2010).\n\nIn addition, there is a lively discussion about the role of experts in\ndemocratic politics. One question concerns how non-experts are to\nidentify experts (Goldman 2001 is the locus classicus).\nAnother question concerns how to balance reliance on experts with\ndemocracy\u2019s commitment to deliberation and equality (see e.g.\nKitcher 2011). There is also a question regarding how to square the\ndemocratic legitimacy conferred by public deliberation among equals\nwith the distinctive epistemic authority of experts (see e.g.\nChristiano 2012).\n\nTwo excellent recent handbooks on political epistemology are Hannon\nand De Ridder (2021) and Edenberg and Hannon (2021). (In addition to\nthe topics listed above, these handbooks also delve into such social\nepistemology topics as political disagreement, polarization, and the\nepistemic responsibilities of citizenship.)\n5.2 Misleading Online Content\n\nThe latest challenge confronting the informational state of the public\nis the accelerating spread of misleading content on the internet. Over\nthe last decade it has become increasingly clear that such content is\nwidespread, pernicious, and threatening democratic function.\nPhilosophers have contributed to emerging research on internet\nepistemology in a number of ways. \n\nOne question, relevant to thinking about preventing the harms of\nmisleading content, is how to define and categorize such content. A\ntypical distinction disambiguates misinformation and disinformation,\nwhere the former is false or inaccurate content not intended to\nmislead and the latter is intended to mislead (Fallis 2016, Floridi\n2013). It is increasingly recognized, though, that misleading content\nneed not be false (Fallis 2015, O\u2019Connor and Weatherall 2019),\nleading some to define malinformation which is intended to mislead but\npotentially true or accurate (Wardle and Derakhshan 2017). Others have\nchallenged the idea that disinformation needs to be misleading, as\nopposed to producing ignorance (Simion 2023) or otherwise blocking\nsuccessful action (Harris 2023). Given the variety and complexity in\nmisleading online content, some argue that these terms will always be\nimprecise (Weatherall and O\u2019Connor 2019) or that we should\ncarefully describe relevant epistemic failures in any case\n(Habgood-Coote 2019). \n\nA number of researchers have turned to virtue epistemology to think\nabout epistemic failures related to the internet. This work has\nidentified socially-oriented vices that might increase susceptibility\nto misleading content (and increase its sharing), such as Cassam\n(2018)\u2019s epistemic insouciance, which he describes as a careless\nattitude towards expertise, especially when communicating with others.\nLynch (2018) argues that epistemic arrogance, which involves an\nunwillingness to learn from others, undermines the process of public\ndebate. Meyer et al. (2021), in empirical work, found an association\nbetween high scores on an epistemic vice scale and false belief. And\nPriest (2021) worries about the role of epistemic vices among elites,\nsuch as obstructionism (using overly complex language and theory), and\nhow these vices impact public belief. On the other side, authors like\nPorter et al. (2022) and Koetke et al. (2022) argue for the benefits\nof intellectual humility \u2013 an awareness of one\u2019s own\nlimitations and openness to the possibility of being wrong \u2013 in\ncommunities grappling with internet misinformation.\n\nSocial media connections and algorithms determine what content is seen\nto what degree and by whom. There have been concerns that various\naspects of this process may exacerbate false beliefs. Echo chambers,\nwhere individuals select online connections and spaces that\ncontinually \u201cecho\u201d their own beliefs back to them, may\nlead to polarization and prevent disconfirmation of false beliefs\n(Cinelli et al. 2021). Nguyen (2020) gives a more specific analysis of\necho chambers as actively discrediting of those with different\nbeliefs, and disambiguates these from epistemic bubbles where there is\nselective exposure to confirmatory content without the discrediting of\noutsiders. (This analysis is also in line with the empirical work done\nby Ruiz and Nilson (2023).) Both sorts of effects are worrying.\nExacerbating this are tendencies by algorithms to present users with\ndata and opinions that confirm their beliefs and attitudes, because\nthat is precisely the content that users tend to like. This is\nsometimes called the \u201cfilter bubble\u201d or \u201cinformation\nbubble\u201d effect (though these various phenomena are by no means\nclearly delineated) (Pariser 2011, Kitchens et al. 2020). One response\nmight be that platforms should make structural and algorithmic choices\nthat best promote accurate beliefs among users, but it has been widely\nacknowledged that this goes against platform incentives to increase\nengagement. Another difficulty is that as platforms shape algorithms\nto prevent the spread of disinformation, the producers of\ndisinformation are incentivized to adapt and create new forms of\nmisleading content (O\u2019Connor and Weatherall 2019).\n\nAn ill-informed populace may not be able to effectively represent\ntheir interests in a democratic society. In order to protect\ndemocratic functioning, it will be necessary for those fighting online\nmisinformation to keep adapting with the best tools and theory\navailable to them. This includes understanding social aspects of\nknowledge and belief formation. In other words, social epistemology\nhas much to say to those faced with the challenging task of protecting\ndemocracy from misleading content.\n5.3 Socio-Epistemic Dysfunctions\n\nInfluenced by long-standing work in feminism and critical race theory,\nsocial epistemology has attempted to theorize about various types of\ndysfunction in the social practices through which we aim to generate,\ncommunicate, assess, and preserve knowledge. In this subsection we\nhighlight several of these.\n\nIn one of the most influential works in epistemology in the last two\ndecades, Miranda Fricker (2007) introduced the term \u201cepistemic\ninjustice\u201d to designate the sort of injustice which wrongs a\nsubject in their capacity as a knower. Fricker distinguished two\nkinds. \u201cTestimonial\u201d injustice obtains when (on the basis\nof identity-based prejudice) an audience gives less credence to a\nspeaker than she deserves. (Fricker illustrated this sort of injustice\nwith Tom Robinson, a character in To Kill a Mockingbird whose\ntestimony, as a Black man on trial for raping a white woman, was\nprejudicially rejected by the all-white jury.)\n\u201cHermeneutical\u201d injustice obtains when, owing to social\nforces which reflect the interests of certain social groups, a subject\nlacks the concepts for understanding and/or communicating socially\nsignificant aspects of her own experience. (Fricker\u2019s example is\nthe experience of women before the term \u201csexual\nharassment\u201d was coined.) Fricker\u2019s (2007) reflections on\nepistemic injustice have inspired a generation of social philosophers\nto pursue questions in this vicinity. Some have sought to amend or\nqualify Fricker\u2019s definitions (Medina 2011, Mason 2011, Anderson\n2012, Davis 2016, Lackey 2018, Maitra 2018), while others have\nemployed one or another notion of epistemic injustice in new domains,\nincluding social or political contexts (Medina 2012, Dular 2021),\nhealth care (Carel and Kidd 2014), education (Kotzee 2017), and\ncriminal law (Lackey 2023).\n\nA second type of socio-epistemic dysfunction of significant interest\nto social epistemologists is ignorance. Influenced by the seminal work\nof Sandra Harding (1991), Michelle Moody-Adams (1994), Charles Mills\n(1997, 2007), Patricia Hill Collins (2000), Nancy Tuana (2004, 2006),\nKristie Dotson (2011), and Gaile Pohlhaus (2012), among others, social\nepistemologists have begun to characterize how\nignorance\u2014understood as involving either false belief or lack of\ninformation\u2014is distributed, and sometimes willfully maintained,\nin communities. The guiding hypothesis, explicitly formulated by Mills\n(2007) in connection with his notion of \u201cwhite ignorance,\u201d\nis that ignorance in contemporary society patterns in ways that\nreflect the interests of dominant social groups. (Because Mills,\nDotson, and others have argued that this sort of ignorance can be\nwillfully maintained through certain social arrangements, it can be\nsomewhat misleading to label this a \u201cdysfunction.\u201d)\nInteresting work has been done in the \u201cepistemology of\nignorance\u201d in connection with women\u2019s health (Tuana 2004),\nmatters of race (Sullivan and Tuana 2007), gender oppression (Gilson\n2011), and trust in social media (Frost-Arnold (2016)), among other\nareas. This work makes clear that the ignorant subject often lacks\nevidence she ought to have. As such, it challenges the\ntraditional idea that the focus of epistemic assessment should be\nrestricted to how well a subject does with the evidence she has. For\nthis reason, the acquisition and handling of evidence, long a topic in\nfeminist and virtue epistemology, has recently begun to attract the\nattention of social epistemologists as well. (For discussion see\nGoldberg 2017, Lackey 2020, Simion 2021, Woodard and Flores 2023).\n\nTo be sure, there are many other types of dysfunction that are\ndiscussed by social epistemologists. We have already mentioned several\nof these above: misleading online content, polarization, bias, and\necho chambers. Beyond these, social epistemologists have been\ndeveloping concepts for additional types. A general framework for\nunderstanding various dimensions of epistemic oppression can be found\nin Dotson (2014). Regarding additional types themselves, Abramson\n(2014) and McKinnon (2017) treat gaslighting as a socio-epistemic\ndysfunction in which one person consistently questions another\u2019s\nsanity or competence in order to destroy the victim\u2019s\nself-confidence and undermine her sense of self (Ru\u00edz 2020\ndevelops the cultural analogue of this phenomenon); Stanley (2015)\npresents a wide-ranging discussion of propaganda, including its\nsocio-epistemic dimensions; Berenstain (2016) introduces the notion of\nepistemic exploitation, the phenomenon in which members of\nunderrepresented groups are burdened by the expectation of informing\ndominant group members about their experiences; Davis (2018) develops\nthe notion of \u201cepistemic appropriation,\u201d the epistemic\nanalogue of cultural appropriation; Ballantyne (2019) discusses\n\u201cepistemic trespassing,\u201d wherein experts assume authority\nand speak on topics beyond their expertise; and Leydon-Hardy (2021)\nidentifies \u201cepistemic infringement\u201d as the phenomenon in\nwhich one person undermines the epistemic agency of another by\nviolating social and epistemic norms.",
