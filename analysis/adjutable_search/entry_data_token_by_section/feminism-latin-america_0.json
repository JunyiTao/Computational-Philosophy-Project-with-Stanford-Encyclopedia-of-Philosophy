    "main_text": "History: A Genealogy of Latin American Feminism || Latin American Feminist Origins (Pre-20th Century)\n1.1 Latin American Feminist Origins (Pre-20th Century)\n\nMost historical genealogies of Latin American feminism trace their\norigins to the social movements beginning in the 1960s and 1970s\ncentered around women\u2019s liberation. However, feminist ideas in\nLatin America are much older than those which have been documented as\npart of feminist political action. The origins of Latin American\nfeminist ideas can be found in reflections on conditions of otherness\nthat emerge as a result of colonialism and in critiques of norms that\nrender the category of man the entry point for humanity. By the 60s\nand 70s, feminism in Latin America had a firmly rooted history\nconcerned with articulating difference and alterity from a\nnon-dominant perspective (Gargallo 2004: 80).\n\nThe existence of a genealogy of Latin American feminisms brings to the\nfore the relationship between women and history. Getting to know the\npast was a critical and necessary component of the feminist movements\nof 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s. The past framed the existence of\nhistorical examples of women\u2019s struggles that served as\nendorsements for the claims of feminist movements (Palacios\n2007: 96). The failure of history to collect the life and action\nof women required new perspectives, which came to include the search\nfor forgotten figures, attention to subjects like the body and female\nsexuality, models of femininity, and attention to structural systems\nof oppression as necessary points of departure for what would become\nthe genre of feminist of scholarship (Palacios 2007: 98). \n\nNotwithstanding, there are still lacunas in Latin American feminist\ngenealogy as the writings of non-white women from the 19th\nand early 20th centuries (and earlier) are seldom found in\nwritten form, given that many non-white women were illiterate, and\ntheir stories were not textually documented. Their ideas and histories\nwere orally transmitted, and current local oral traditions account for\nthem (Gargallo 2010: 12a). Oral history projects enable contemporary\nlisteners to hear the voices of voiceless women and be witness to the\ndocument of concerns that grow out of poverty and colonial obscurity\n(Oliver 2018, 32). For instance, the colonial resistance of\nBara\u00fanda, wife of Garifuna leader Satuy\u00e9, is legendary\nfor her people; her memory travels in songs sung by Garifuna women of\nHonduras and Belize. Similarly, the story of Anacaona, Taino chief\n(cacica) of Jaragua Hispa\u00f1ola, is one of colonial\nresistance; prior to her execution she was offered clemency in return\nfor becoming a concubine for a Spaniard, and her refusal and\nsubsequent death solidified her legendary status which is immortalized\nin songs from Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. The stories\nof Indigenous women of these times continue to be shared orally\nthrough myth, songs, and proverbs, and contribute to the foundations\nof Latin American feminist thought (Gargallo 2010: 14a).\n\nOne of the earliest documented writers in the Latin American feminist\ntradition comes from the 17th century. Arguing in favor of\nthe educational and intellectual rights of women, Juana In\u00e9s\nMar\u00eda del Carmen Mart\u00ednez de Zaragoza Gaxiola de Asbaje\ny Ram\u00edrez de Santillana Odonoj\u00fa (1651\u20131695),\nrecognized by many as Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz or Sor Juana of\nMexico, was a self-educated scholar of the Baroque period whose\nwritings have garnered quite a bit of philosophical attention as part\nof the Latin American philosophical canon. She was well known during\nher lifetime as evidenced by multiple publications of her work.\nHowever, by the second half of the 18th century, her fame\ndiminished as attention to Baroque poetry declined. In 1951, her work\nrecovered attention with the publication of her complete works\n(Gargallo 2009: 419). Subsequently, Juana Ines de la Cruz has\nbecome an iconic Latin American feminist figure whose work exemplifies\nthe existence of lettered women intellectuals who resisted systems of\ndomination. For instance, Approaches to the Theory of Freedom in\nSor Juana Ines de la Cruz (2018) advances a philosophical\nexploration on freedom in the corpus of Juana Ines\u2019 and\nmethodologically situates her in the Mexican philosophical tradition\n(Aspe Armella 2018).  Alternatively, in Feminist Perspectives\non Sor Juana Ines de La Cruz (ed. Stephanie Merrimm 1999) Juana\nInes is framed in terms of her feminist impact on literature and\nculture in an anthology that bridges her from the past into the\npresent. \n\nJuana In\u00e9s de la Cruz was one among many feminist writers who\nadvocated for social and cultural changes, including the role of\nwomen. Teresa Margarida da Silva e Orta of Brazil (1711\u20131793)\nwas the first woman in the Portuguese-speaking world to publish a\nnovel and the first Brazilian-born person to edit a book in Europe.\nShe advocated for the autonomy of the Indigenous and the rights of\nwomen in science (Gargallo 2004: 80). Flora Trist\u00e1n of\nPer\u00fa (1803\u20131844) argued for women\u2019s equality and\nits important relationship to workers\u2019 rights (Gargallo 2004:\n80). Argentinian abolitionist Juana Manso (1819\u20131875) detailed\neducation and philosophical instruction as a route to the moral and\nintellectual emancipation of women. This position was taken up at the\nend of the century by figures like Rita Cetina Guti\u00e9rrez of\nMexico (1846\u20131908) and Visitaci\u00f3n Padilla of Honduras\n(1882\u20131960) (Gargallo 2009: 418). Cetina Guti\u00e9rrez\nfounded La Siempreviva in M\u00e9rida, Mexico\u2019s first secular\nschool for poor girls and an art college for young women. She is cited\nas one of Mexico\u2019s first feminists who promoted secular\neducation of women and fought for their self-determination. Padilla\nfounded the Sociedad Cultural Feminina, which promoted access to\neducation, especially for women. Venezuelan Teresa de la Parra\n(1889-1936) used writing as a mechanism of resistance from which to\nquestion the limitations of the gendered experience exemplifying the\nway that literature can be both political and philosophical. Broadly\nspeaking, feminist ideas are rooted in women\u2019s personal\nexperience and this relationship is readily explored through\nliterature, poetry, and testimonial narrative that concretely reflects\nthe feminist maxim \u201cthe personal is political\u201d (Schutte\n1993: 213).  \n\nThe existence of early Latin American feminist ideas was not attended\nto until years after their inception. The impact of ideas centering on\nwomen\u2019s rights to intellectual and educational life, equality,\nand workers\u2019 rights was not immediate since they were not given\nimportance in their respective contexts. During the feminist movements\nof the 20th century, many of these figures re-emerged as\npart of a Latin American feminist theoretical landscape (Gargallo\n2004: 81). Early Latin American feminist ideas came to be evaluated\nthrough historical memory that gives weight to the claim that Latin\nAmerican feminist ideas existed prior to the women\u2019s movements\nof the 1960s and 1970s. The existence of early Latin American\nfeminist ideas that predate the feminist movement questions the\nrelationship between women, history, and epistemology (Palacios\n2007: 104). In this context, the philosophical demand is a\nreading of the past complexly incorporating women as political actors\nand knowledge producers even if they were not seen as such in their\ntimes. \n",
