    "main_text": "Functions of Criminal Law\n2. Functions of Criminal Law\n\n\nFew deny that one function of criminal law is to deliver justified\npunishment. Some go further and claim that this is the sole function\nof criminal law (Moore 1997, 28\u201329). Call this the punitive\nview. Rules of criminal procedure and evidence, on this view,\nhelp facilitate the imposition of justified punishment, while keeping\nthe risk of unjustified punishment within acceptable bounds. Rules of\nsubstantive criminal law help give potential offenders fair warning\nthat they may be punished. Both sets of rules combat objections we\nmight otherwise make to laws that authorize the intentional imposition\nof harm. To combat objections, of course, is not itself to make a\npositive case for such laws. That case, on the punitive view, is made\nby the justified punishments that criminal courts impose. This is not\nto say anything about what the justification of\npunishment is. It is merely to say that criminal law is to be\njustified in punitive terms.\n\n\nSome object that this focus on punishment is misplaced. The central\nfunction criminal law fulfills in responding to crime, some say, is\nthat of calling suspected offenders to account in criminal courts\n(Gardner 2007, 80; Duff 2010c, 16). This view puts the criminal trial\nat the centre, not just of criminal proceedings, but of criminal law\nas a whole (Duff 2013a, 196). Trials invite defendants to account for\nthemselves either by denying the accusation that they offended, or by\npleading a defence. The prospect of conviction and punishment puts\ndefendants under pressure to offer an adequate account. Call this\nthe curial view. It differs from the punitive view in two\nways. First, part of the positive case for criminal law is\nindependent of the imposition of punishment. Second, part of\nthe positive case for imposing criminal punishment is\ndependent on the punishment being part of a process of calling\nto account. The following two paragraphs expand on both these\nclaims.\n\n\nAs to the first, we often have reason to account for our actions to\nothers. We can leave open for now the precise conditions under which\nthis is so. But it is plausible to think that if Alisha steals from\nBintu she has reason for account for the theft, and that if Chika\nintentionally kills Dawn she has reason to account for the killing.\nDefenders of the curial view argue that criminal proceedings are of\nintrinsic value when defendants (are called to) offer accounts of\nthemselves that they have reason to offer in criminal courts (Gardner\n2007, 190\u2013191; Duff 2010c, 15\u201317). Imagine Alisha stole\nfrom Bintu because she was under duress. Imagine Chika intentionally\nkilled Dawn to defend herself or others. Neither of these defendants,\nwe can assume, is justifiably punished. On the punitive view, criminal\nlaw\u2019s function does not stand to be fulfilled. On the curial\nview, things are different. Alisha and Chika both have reason to\naccount for their behaviour\u2014to explain what they did and why\nthey did it. Criminal proceedings invite each to provide that account\nand put each under pressure to do so. Assuming Alisha and Chika have\nreason to account in a criminal court, proceedings in which they (are\ncalled to) do so are of intrinsic value. One of criminal law\u2019s\nfunctions is fulfilled even if no-one is, or should be, punished.\n\n\nTo endorse the curial view is not, of course, to say that we should do\naway with criminal punishment. But it is to say that the\nconnection between trial and punishment is not merely instrumental.\nSome think that the facts that make punishment fitting\u2014say,\nculpable wrongdoing\u2014obtain independently of criminal proceedings\nthemselves (Moore 1997, 33). We use those proceedings to ensure that\nsaid facts are highly likely to have obtained\u2014that \\(D\\) is\nhighly likely to have culpably committed a wrong. On the curial view,\nthe fact that \\(D\\) has been tried and found guilty (or has entered a\nguilty plea) is itself part of what makes it fitting that\n\\(D\\) is punished. The fitting way to respond to criminal wrongdoing,\non this view, is to call the wrongdoer to account for her wrong. To\ncall \\(D\\) to account is to attempt to both (a) get \\(D\\) to answer\nfor wrongdoing (as occurs in court), and (b) get \\(D\\) to confront\nwrongdoing for which she has no satisfactory answer (as occurs when\n\\(D\\) is punished). So it is only\nbecause \\(D\\) has first been tried and found guilty (or has\nentered a guilty plea) that punishment counts as a fitting response to\n\\(D\\)\u2019s wrong (Gardner 2007, 80; Duff 2013a, 205). We can see\nthe implications of this view by imagining a world in which trials are\nabolished, because some new-fangled machine allows us to identify\nculpable wrongdoers with perfect accuracy. Having no doubt that \\(D\\)\nis guilty, we simply impose punishment on \\(D\\). On the curial view,\nthe punishments we impose are inherently defective: they are not\nimposed as part of a process of calling to account. Though our\nnew-fangled machine might justify doing away with trials\u2014once we\nfactor in how expensive they can be\u2014we would lose something of\nvalue in doing away with them.\n\n\nIf criminal law does have a particular function, we can ask whether\nthat function is distinctive of criminal law. We can ask, in\nother words, whether it helps distinguish criminal law from the rest\nof the legal system. It has been claimed that criminal law is\ndistinctive in imposing punishment (Moore 1997, 18\u201330; Husak\n2008, 72). One might also claim that criminal law alone calls\ndefendants to account. But punishments are imposed in civil\nproceedings\u2014exemplary damages are the obvious case. And it is\narguable that civil proceedings also call defendants to\naccount\u2014that they too invite defendants to offer a denial or\nplead a defence; that they too use the prospect of legal liability to\nput defendants under pressure to account adequately (Duff 2014a).\n\n\nIn response, one might try to refine the function that is distinctive\nof criminal law. Perhaps criminal law\u2019s function is to respond\nto public wrongs (whether by calling to account or punishing such\nwrongdoers), whereas the function of civil law is to respond to\nprivate wrongs. What we should make of this proposal depends on what a\npublic wrong is (Lamond 2007; Lee 2015; Edwards and Simester\n2017). To make progress, we can distinguish between primary\nduties\u2014like duties not to rape or rob\u2014and secondary\nduties\u2014like duties to answer, or suffer punishment, for rape or\nrobbery. We incur duties of the latter kind by breaching duties of the\nformer.\n\n\nIf the public/private distinction is cashed out in terms of primary\nduties, then responding to public wrongs cannot be distinctive of\ncriminal law. Many wrongs are both crimes and torts. So the two bodies\nof law often respond to breaches of the same primary duty. A more\npromising proposal looks to secondary duties. Perhaps criminal\nlaw\u2019s distinctive function is to respond to wrongs on behalf\nof us all\u2014to discharge secondary duties owed to the\ncommunity as a whole (Duff 2011, 140). Perhaps the function of civil\nlaw is to respond to wrongs on behalf of some of us\u2014to\ndischarge secondary duties owed to particular individuals. This might\nbe thought to explain why criminal proceedings, unlike civil\nproceedings, are controlled by state officials: why officials can\ninitiate proceedings that individual victims oppose, and discontinue\nproceedings that victims initiate.\n\n\nThe view described in the previous paragraph conceives of criminal law\nas an instrument of the community\u2014a way of ensuring that the\ncommunity gets what it is owed from wrongdoers. Call it the\ncommunitarian view. If we combine this with the curial view, the\ndistinctive function of criminal law is to seek answers owed to the\ncommunity as a whole. One might doubt that the functions of criminal\nand civil law can be so neatly distinguished. It is arguable that\ncivil law sometimes responds to wrongs on behalf of all of\nus\u2014civil proceedings can be brought against \\(D\\) on the\nbasis that her conduct is a nuisance to the public at large, or on the\nbasis that \\(D\\) is a public official whose conduct is an abuse of\npower. More importantly, one might claim that in the case of\nparadigmatic crimes\u2014like robbery, rape, or\nbattery\u2014criminal law responds to wrongs on behalf of particular\nindividuals\u2014on behalf of those who have been robbed, raped, or\nbattered. On this view, a positive case for criminalization need not\nawait the finding that \\(D\\) owes something to the whole community. It\nis at least sometimes enough that \\(D\\) owes something to those \\(D\\)\nhas wronged, which \\(D\\) would fail to provide in the absence of\ncriminal proceedings.\n\n\nThose who reject the communitarian view might be thought to face the\nfollowing difficulty: they might be thought to lack an explanation of\nofficial control over how far criminal proceedings go. If criminal law\nseeks what is owed by wrongdoers to the wronged, doesn\u2019t\nofficial control amount to theft of a conflict properly controlled by\nthe two parties (Christie 1977)? Not necessarily. First, we should not\nalways require the wronged to have to pursue those who have wronged\nthem. Second, we should not always support those who think themselves\nwronged in pursuing alleged wrongdoers. As to the first point, some\nare trapped in abusive relationships with those who wrong them. Others\nare susceptible to manipulation that serves to silence their\ncomplaints. Some wrongdoers can use wealth and social status to stop\naccusers in their tracks. As to the second point, the temptation to\nretaliate in the face of wrongdoing is often great. It is all too easy\nfor the pursuit of justice to become the pursuit of revenge, and for\nthe perceived urgency of the pursuit to generate false accusations.\nOfficial control can help vulnerable individuals\u2014like those\ndescribed above\u2014to get what they are owed. And it can mitigate\nthe damage done by those trying to exact vengeance and settle scores\n(Gardner 2007, 214\u2013216). It can ensure that those in positions\nof power cannot wrong others with impunity, and reduce the likelihood\nthat vindictiveness begets retaliation, which begets violent conflict\nfrom which all lose out (Wellman 2005, 8\u201310). We can add that\ncriminal proceedings may help protect others against being wronged in\nfuture. Those wronged may have a duty to give up control of\nproceedings in order to provide this protection (Tadros 2011c,\n297\u2013299).\n\n\nThese remarks suggest an alternative to the communitarian view.\nAccording to the alternative, the secondary duties of concern in civil\nand criminal proceedings are typically one and the same. The positive\ncase for criminal law\u2019s involvement is not that it discharges\nduties of interest to the criminal law alone, but that it enables\nduties of general interest to be discharged less imperfectly than they\notherwise would be\u2014than they would be if the criminal law took\nno interest in them. Call this the imperfectionist view. What\nis distinctive of criminal law, on this view, is not its function but\nits mode of functioning: the manner in which it fulfills functions\nshared with other bodies of law.\n\n\nSome writers seek criminal law\u2019s distinctiveness in a different\nplace. What is distinctive about criminal law, they claim, is that it\npublicly censures or condemns. This expressive function is sometimes\nassociated with criminal punishment (Husak 2008, 92\u201395).\nBecause other bodies of law sometimes punish, and because punishment\ntypically\u2014perhaps necessarily\u2014expresses censure (Feinberg\n1970), the expressive function is at least partly shared. But the\nmessage sent by criminal law is not sent only at the sentencing stage.\nIt is sent the moment a guilty verdict is reached by a criminal\ncourt\u2014by the declaration that \\(D\\) has been criminally\nconvicted (Simester 2005, 33\u201336). The social significance of\nconviction is very different to that of (say) the verdict that \\(D\\)\nis a tortfeasor: the former verdict conveys, in and of itself, that\n\\(D\\)\u2019s conduct reflects badly on \\(D\\). Though additional\ndetail may generate the same conclusion in the case of a civil\nverdict, such detail is not required in the case of criminal\nconviction. If this is right, the distinctiveness of criminal law\nturns out not to consist in the fact that it provides for\npunishment. It turns out to consist (at least in part) in the\nprovision of a technique for condemning wrongdoers which does not\nrequire that we punish in order to condemn.\n\n\nSo far, we have focused on the functions criminal law fulfills in\nresponse to the commission of crime. It is plausible to think,\nhowever, that criminal law\u2019s functions include preventing crime\nfrom occurring. We can see this by asking what success would look like\nfor the criminal law. Would criminal law have succeeded if all thieves\nand murderers were tried and punished? Or would it have succeeded if\nthere\nwas no theft or murder, because criminalization resulted in\nwould-be thieves and murderers refraining from such wrongs? Notice that\nto pose these two questions as alternatives is not to deny that\npunishment might be justified in preventive terms. It is\nrather to suggest that resorting to punishment to achieve prevention\nis already a partial failure for the criminal law. It is a failure to\ndeter those who, ex hypothesi, have already committed\ncriminal offences. Had the creation of those offences been an\nunqualified success, there would have been nothing for which to punish\nanyone.\n\n\nOne might hold that criminal law\u2019s sole function is to\nprevent criminal wrongdoing. Call this the preventive view.\nDefenders of this view need not say that we should enact whatever laws\nwill achieve the most prevention. That \\(X\\) is the function of \\(Y\\)\ndoes not entail that we are justified in doing whatever will achieve\nmost of \\(X\\) with \\(Y\\). That cutting is the function of knives does\nnot entail that knife-holders are justified in cutting whatever they\nsee. Holders of the preventive view can, in other words, accept the\nexistence of constraints on prevention, that are not themselves\njustified in preventive terms (Hart 1968, 35\u201350). What they\ncannot accept is a positive case for criminal law that is not\npreventive.\n\n\nSome hold a mixed view that combines elements of those\nconsidered above (Alexander and Ferzan 2009, 3\u201319; Simester and\nvon Hirsch 2011, 3\u201318; Tadros 2016, 159\u2013172). One way to\nconstruct such a view is by distinguishing between primary and\nsecondary functions. Primary functions are those that, when all else\nis equal, we have most reason to want the law to fulfil. Secondary\nfunctions are those we have reason to want the law to fulfil if it\nfails to fulfil its primary functions. Criminal law\u2019s primary\nfunctions, it is plausible to think, are preventive. Ceteris\nparibus, we have most reason to want criminal law to bring about\na world in which wrongs like theft or murder do not occur. Failing\nthat, we have reason to want criminal law to call thieves and\nmurderers to account, and to punish those who have no adequate account\nto offer.\n\n\nThere is some scepticism about mixed views. For some, the worries are\nconceptual. Moore claims that justified punishment must be imposed for\nreasons of desert, and that for this reason the punitive and\npreventive functions cannot be combined. We are unable to \u2018kill two\nbirds with the proverbial one stone, for by aiming at one of the birds\nwe will necessarily miss the other\u2019 (Moore 1997, 28). Several\nreplies are available. First, even if this is a problem for a mixed\nview of punishment, it need not be for a mixed view of\ncriminal law. Grant that punishment must be imposed for\nreasons of desert. It does not follow that criminal offences cannot be\ncreated for reasons of prevention. Criminalization and punishment are\ndifferent acts, and can be performed for different reasons (Edwards\nand Simester 2014). Second, to claim that \\(X\\) is part of the\npositive case for criminal law\u2014that it is one of criminal\nlaw\u2019s\nfunctions\u2014is not to claim that \\(X\\) should be part of the\nmission of every criminal justice official (Gardner 2007,\n202). Reasons that help make a positive case for our actions are often\nreasons for which we should not act. That one will be financially\nsecure is a reason to get married, but one should not get married in\norder to be financially secure. Similarly, to say that prevention\nhelps make a positive case for criminal law\u2014and for\npunishment\u2014is not to say that judges should punish for that\nreason.\n\n\nOther worries about mixed views are pragmatic (Duff 2010a). As\ncriminal wrongdoing will persist whatever we do, the preventive\nfunction sets criminal law an insatiable goal. There is a standing\nrisk that law-makers who pursue that goal will deprive us of a criminal law\nthat fulfills its other functions. Consider again the curial\nview. Plausibly, we have reason to account for wrongs like theft and\nfraud in criminal court, but no reason to account for every\ninteraction with property or all misleading statements from which we\nstand to gain. If defendants are to be called to account for the\nwrongs, it is these that must be criminalized. To criminalize\ntrivialities\u2014in pursuit of preventive ends\u2014is to drain\ncriminal proceedings of their intrinsic value (Duff 2010b). No doubt\nthese are important worries. But they do nothing to suggest that we\nshould reject a mixed view. At most, they show that\nlaw-makers also should not take prevention to be part of\ntheir mission. As we already saw, this conclusion does not show that\nprevention is not part of the positive case for criminal law.  And it\nmay anyway be too strong. Law-makers who exclude prevention from their\nmission may refuse to create crimes that would prevent a great deal of\nharm. The cost of refusing to create these crimes might be greater\nthan the cost of calling people to account for trivialities, and this\nmight be so even when alternative means of prevention are factored\nin. If it would, criminal law\u2019s preventive function should be\npart of the law-making mission: it is a function law-makers should\nindeed aim to fulfil.\n",
