    "main_text": "Must Rule-consequentialism Be Guilty of Collapse, Incoherence, or Rule-worship?\n8. Must Rule-consequentialism Be Guilty of Collapse, Incoherence, or Rule-worship?\n\nAn oft-repeated line of objection to rule-consequentialism from the\nmid 1960s to the mid 1990s was that this theory is fatally impaled on\none or the other horn of the following dilemma: Either\nrule-consequentialism collapses into practical equivalence with the\nsimpler act-consequentialism, or rule-consequentialism is\nincoherent.\n\nHere is why some have thought rule-consequentialism collapses into\npractical equivalence with act-consequentialism. Consider a rule that\nrule-consequentialism purports to favor \u2014 e.g.,\n\u201cdon\u2019t steal\u201d. Now suppose an agent is in some\nsituation where stealing would produce more good than not stealing. If\nrule-consequentialism selects rules on the basis of their expected\ngood, rule-consequentialism seems driven to admit that compliance with\nthe rule \u201cdon\u2019t steal except when \u2026 or \u2026 or\n\u2026\u201d is better than compliance with the simpler rule\n\u201cdon\u2019t steal\u201d. This point generalizes. In other\nwords, for every situation where compliance with some rule would not\nproduce the greatest expected good, rule-consequentialism seems driven\nto favor instead compliance with some amended rule that does not miss\nout on producing the greatest expected good in the case at hand. But\nif rule-consequentialism operates this way, then in practice it will\nend up requiring the very same acts that act-consequentialism\nrequires.\n\nIf rule-consequentialism ends up requiring the very same acts that\nact-consequentialism requires, then rule-consequentialism is indeed in\nterrible trouble. Rule-consequentialism is the more complicated of the\ntwo theories. This leads to the following objection. What is the point\nof rule-consequentialism with its infinitely amended rules if we can\nget the same practical result much more efficiently with the simpler\nact-consequentialism?\n\nRule-consequentialists in fact have an excellent reply to the\nobjection that their theory collapses into practical equivalence with\nact-consequentialism. This reply relies on the point that the best\nkind of rule-consequentialism ranks systems of rules not in\nterms of the expected good of complying with them, but in\nterms of the expected good of their teaching and\nacceptance. Now if a rule forbidding stealing, for example,\nhas exception clause after exception clause after exception clause\ntacked on to it, the rule with all these exception clauses will\nprovide too much opportunity for temptation to convince agents that\none of the exception clauses applies, when in fact stealing would be\nadvantageous to the agent. And this point about temptation will also\nundermine other people\u2019s confidence that their property\nwon\u2019t be stolen. The same is true of most other moral rules:\nincorporating too many exception clauses could undermine\npeople\u2019s assurance that others will behave in certain ways (such\nas keeping promises and avoiding stealing).\n\nFurthermore, when comparing alternative rules, we must also consider\nthe relative costs of getting them internalised by new generations.\nClearly, the costs of getting new generations to learn either an\nenormous number of rules or hugely complicated rules would be\nprohibitive. So rule-consequentialism will favor a code of rules\nwithout too many rules, and without too much complication within the\nrules.\n\nThere are also costs associated with getting new generations to\ninternalise rules that require one to make enormous sacrifices for\nothers with whom one has no particular connection. Of course,\nfollowing such demanding rules will produce many benefits, mainly to\nothers. But the costs associated with internalising such rules should\nbe weighed against the benefits of following them. At some level of\ndemandingness, the costs of getting such demanding rules internalised\nwill outweigh the benefits that following them will produce. Hence,\ndoing a careful cost/benefit analysis of internalising demanding rules\nwill come out opposing rules\u2019 being too demanding.\n\nThe code of rules that rule-consequentialism favours a code comprised\nof rules that are not too numerous, too complicated, or too demanding\ncan sometimes lead people to do acts that do not have the greatest\nexpected value. For example, following the simpler rule\n\u201cDon\u2019t steal\u201d will sometimes produce less good\nconsequences than following a more complicated rule \u201cDon\u2019t\nsteal except when \u2026 or \u2026 or \u2026 or \u2026 or\n\u2026\u201d. Another example might be following a rule that allows\npeople to give some degree of priority to their own projects, even\nwhen they could produce more good by sacrificing their own projects in\norder to help others. Still, rule-consequentialism\u2019s contention\nis that bringing about widespread acceptance of a simpler and less\ndemanding code, even if acceptance of that code does sometimes lead\npeople to do acts with sub-optimal consequences, has higher expected\nvalue in the long run than bringing about widespread acceptance of a\nmaximally complicated and demanding code. Since rule-consequentialism\ncan tell people to follow this simpler and less demanding code, even\nwhen following it will not to maximise expected good,\nrule-consequentialism escapes collapse into practical equivalence to\nact-consequentialism.\n\nTo the extent that rule-consequentialism circumvents collapse, this\ntheory is accused of incoherence. Rule-consequentialism is accused of\nincoherence for maintaining that an act can be morally permissible or\neven required though the act fails to maximise expected good. Behind\nthis accusation must be the assumption that rule-consequentialism\ncontains an overriding commitment to maximise the good. It is\nincoherent to have this overriding commitment and then to oppose an\nact required by the commitment. (For developments of this line of\nthought, see Arneson 2005; Card 2007; Wall 2009.)\n\nIn order to evaluate the incoherence objection to\nrule-consequentialism, we need to be clearer about the supposed\nlocation of an overriding commitment to maximize the good. Is this\ncommitment supposed to be part of the rule-consequentialist\nagent\u2019s moral psychology? Or is it supposed to be part of the\ntheory rule-consequentialism?\n\nWell, rule-consequentialists need not have maximizing the good as\ntheir ultimate and overriding moral goal. Instead, they could have a\nmoral psychology as follows:\n\n\nTheir fundamental moral motivation is to do what is impartially\ndefensible.\n\nThey believe acting on impartially justified rules is impartially\ndefensible.\n\nThey also believe that rule-consequentialism is on balance the best\naccount of impartially justified rules.\n\n\nAgents with this moral psychology \u2014 i.e., this combination of\nmoral motivation and beliefs \u2014 would be morally motivated to do\nas rule-consequentialism prescribes. This moral psychology is\ncertainly possible. And, for agents who have it, there is nothing\nincoherent about following rules when doing so will not maximize the\nexpected good.\n\nSo, even if rule-consequentialist agents need not have an\noverriding commitment to maximize expected good, does their\ntheory contain such a commitment? No, rule-consequentialism\nis essentially the conjunction of two claims: (1) that rules are to be\nselected solely in terms of their consequences and (2) that these\nrules determine which kinds of acts are morally wrong. This is really\nall there is to the theory \u2014 in particular, there is not some\nthird component consisting in or entailing an overriding commitment to\nmaximize expected good.\n\nWithout an overriding commitment to maximize the expected good, there\nis nothing incoherent in rule-consequentialism\u2019s forbidding some\nkinds of act, even when they maximize the expected good. Likewise,\nthere is nothing incoherent about rule-consequentialism\u2019s\nrequiring other kinds of act, even when they conflict with maximizing\nthe expected good. The best known objection to rule-consequentialism\ndies once we realize that neither the rule-consequentialist agent nor\nthe theory itself contains an overriding commitment to maximize the\ngood.\n\nThe viability of this defense of rule-consequentialism against the\nincoherence objection may depend in part on what the argument for\nrule-consequentialism is supposed to be. The defense seems less viable\nif the argument for rule-consequentialism starts from a commitment to\nconsequentialist assessment. For starting with such a commitment seems\nvery close to starting from an overriding commitment to maximize the\nexpected good. The defence against the incoherence objection seems far\nmore secure, however, if the argument for rule-consequentialism is\nthat this theory does better than any other moral theory at specifying\nan impartial justification for intuitively plausible moral rules. (For\nmore on this, see Hooker 2005, 2007; Rajczi 2016; Wolf 2016; Copp\n2020.)\n\nAnother old objection to rule-consequentialism is that\nrule-consequentialists must be \u201crule-worshipers\u201d \u2014\ni.e., people who will stick to the rules even when doing so will\nobviously be disastrous.\n\nThe answer to this objection is that rule-consequentialism endorses a\nrule requiring one to prevent disaster, even if doing so requires\nbreaking other rules (Brandt 1992: 87\u20138, 150\u20131,\n156\u20137). To be sure, there are many complexities about what\ncounts as a disaster. Think about what counts as a disaster when the\n\u201cprevent disaster\u201d rule is in competition with a rule\nagainst lying. Now think about what counts as a disaster when the\n\u201cprevent disaster\u201d rule is in competition with a rule\nagainst stealing, or even more when in competition with a rule against\nphysically harming the innocent. Rule-consequentialism may need to be\nclearer about such matters. But at least it cannot rightly be accused\nof potentially leading to disaster.\n\nAn important confusion to avoid is to think that\nrule-consequentialism\u2019s including a \u201cprevent\ndisaster\u201d rule means that rule-consequentialism collapses into\npractical equivalence with maximising act-consequentialism. Maximising\nact-consequentialism holds that we should lie, or steal, or harm the\ninnocent whenever doing so would produce even a little more\nexpected good than not doing so would. A rule requiring one to prevent\ndisaster does not have this implication. Rather, the \u201cprevent\ndisaster\u201d rule comes into play only when there is a very much\nlarger difference in the amounts of expected value at stake.\n\nWoodard (2022) contends that the \u201cprevent disaster\u201d rule\nneeds reconceptualizing. Many rules identify kinds of reasons.\nExamples are the reason to prevent harm, the reason not to steal, and\nthe reason to keep your promises. But, Woodard holds, we should not\nthink of the \u201cprevent disaster\u201d rule as being a rule\nidentifying a kind of reason, which then is claimed to have overriding\nforce. We should rather think that the \u201cprevent disaster\u201d\nrule distinguishes between cases in which the reason to prevent harm\noverrides opposing moral reasons and cases in which the reason to\nprevent harm is weaker than opposing reasons.\n\nEven if Woodard is correct about this, a \u201cprevent\ndisaster\u201d rule can be accused of vagueness and indeterminacy.\nIndeed, the line between cases in which the moral reason to prevent\nharm overrides opposing moral reasons and cases in which the\nmoral reason to prevent harm is weaker than opposing moral\nreasons might well be indeterminant. Woollard (2022) argues that\nadmitting such vagueness and indeterminacy does not weaken\nrule-consequentialism. And she draws on her earlier work (2015) to\nexplain how rule-consequentialism\u2019s \u201cprevent\ndisaster\u201d rule need not impale the theory on the dilemma of\neither being overly demanding or placing a counterintuitive limit on a\nrequirement to come to the aid of others.\n",
