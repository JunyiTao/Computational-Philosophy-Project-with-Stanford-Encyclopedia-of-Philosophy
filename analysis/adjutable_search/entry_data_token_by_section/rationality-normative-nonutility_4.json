    "main_text": "Incommensurability || The Challenge from Incommensurability\n3.1 The Challenge from Incommensurability\n\nAnother challenge to expected utility maximization is to the idea that\npreferences are totally ordered\u2014to the idea that consequences\ncan be ranked according to a single, consistent utility function. In\neconomics, this idea goes back at least to Aumann (1962); in\nphilosophy, it has been taken up more recently by ethicists.\nEconomists tend to frame the challenge as a challenge to the idea that\nthe preference relation is complete, and ethicists to the\nidea that the betterness relation is complete. I use\n\\(\\succcurlyeq\\) to represent whichever relation is at issue,\nrecognizing that some proposals may be more compelling in one case\nthan the other.\n\nThe key claim is that there are some pairs of options for which it is\nfalse that one is preferred to (or better than) the other, but it is\nalso false that they are equi-preferred (or equally good). Proposed\nexamples include both the mundane and the serious: a Mexican\nrestaurant and a Chinese restaurant; a career in the military and a\ncareer as a priest; and, in an example due to Sartre (1946), whether\nto stay with one\u2019s ailing mother or join the Free French. Taking\nup the second of these examples: it is not the case that a career in\nthe military is preferred to (or better than) a career as a priest,\nnor vice versa; but it is also not the case that they are\nequi-preferred (or equally good). Call the relation that holds between\noptions in these pairs incommensurability.\n\nIncommensurability is most directly a challenge to Completeness, since\non the most natural interpretation of \\(\\succcurlyeq,\\) the fact that\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are incommensurable means that neither \\(A\n\\succcurlyeq B\\) nor \\(B \\succcurlyeq A.\\) But incommensurability can\ninstead be framed as a challenge to Transitivity, if we assume that\nincommensurability is indifference, or define \\(A \\succcurlyeq B\\) as\nthe negation of \\(B \\succ A\\) (thus assuming Completeness by\ndefinition). To see this, notice that if two options \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare incommensurable, then \u201csweetening\u201d \\(A\\) to a slightly\nbetter \\(A^+\\) will still leave \\(A^+\\) and \\(B\\) incommensurable. For\nexample, if \\(A\\) is a career in the military and \\(A^+\\) is this\ncareer but with a slightly higher salary, the latter is still\nincommensurable with a career as a priest. This pattern suffices to\nshow that the relation \\(\\sim\\) is intransitive, since \\(A \\sim B\\)\nand \\(B \\sim {A^+},\\) but \\({A^+} \\succ A\\) (de Sousa 1974).\n\nThere are four options for understanding incommensurability.\nEpistemicists hold that there is always some fact of the\nmatter about which of the three relations \\((\\succ,\\) \\(\\prec,\\)\n\\(\\sim)\\) holds, but that it is sometimes difficult or impossible to\ndetermine which one\u2014thus incommensurability is merely apparent.\nThey can model the decision problem in the standard way, but as a\nproblem of uncertainty about values: one does not know whether one is\nin a state in which \\(A \\succcurlyeq B,\\) but one assigns some\nprobability to that state, and maximizes expected utility taking these\nkinds of uncertainties into account. Indeterminists hold that\nit is indeterminate which relation holds, because these relations are\nvague; thus incommensurability is a type of vagueness (Griffin 1986,\nBroome 1997, Sugden 2009, Constantinescu 2012).\nIncomparabilists hold that in cases of incommensurability,\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) simply cannot be compared (de Sousa 1974, Raz 1988,\nSinnott-Armstrong 1988). Finally, those who hold that\nincommensurability is parity hold that there is a fourth\nrelation than can obtain between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\): \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are\n\u201con a par\u201d if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) can be compared but it is\nnot the case that one of the three relations holds (Chang 2002a,\n2002b, 2012, 2015, 2016).
