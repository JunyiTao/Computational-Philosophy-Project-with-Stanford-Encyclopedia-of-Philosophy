    "main_text": "Method\n3. Method\n\n\nThe Sophist and Statesman search for definitions, \nand both dialogues focus on the search. The Sophist speaks \noften of the hunt in which we are engaged and of the sophist as our \nquarry. In this hunt the sophist time and again eludes us, taking \ncover in the darkness of not-being, reappearing occasionally to \ndispute the very existence of the kind to which we wish to assign \nhim. How can we define the sophist at all, if we cannot get hold of \nhim or coherently characterize the kind to which he belongs? The \nStatesman repeatedly notices the road traveled\u2014longer \nroads and shorter roads that will take us to our destination or lead \nus astray. The dialogue often reflects on better and worse methods of\nseeking the goal. The Sophist and the first part of the \nStatesman represent the search by means of an elaborate \ntree-like system of roads. The inquirers travel down these branching \nroads; at each fork they must choose which branch to take in the hope\nof finding their quarry, and that quarry alone, at the terminus. This\nmethod of discovery is called division, and in its most \nusual form it is the repeated dichotomy of a general kind into two\nsubordinate kinds. Inquirers use \ndivision to locate a target kind at the terminus of one branch of the\ndivision. A definition, when reached by this means, recounts the \nsteps of the journey.\n",
