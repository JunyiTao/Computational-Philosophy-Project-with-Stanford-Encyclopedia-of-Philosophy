    "main_text": "The Debate About The Reach of Liberalism || Is Liberalism Justified in All Political Communities?\n4.1 Is Liberalism Justified in All Political Communities?\n\nIn On Liberty Mill argued that \u201cLiberty, as a\nprinciple, has no application to any state of things anterior to the\ntime when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and\nequal discussion\u201d (1963, vol. 18: 224). Thus \u201cDespotism is\na legitimate form of government in dealing with barbarians, provided\nthe end be their improvement\u2026\u201d (1963, vol. 18: 224). This\npassage \u2014 infused with the spirit of nineteenth century\nimperialism (and perhaps, as some maintain, latent racism) \u2014 is\noften ignored by defenders of Mill as an embarrassment (Parekh, 1994;\nParekh, 1995; Mehta, 1999; Pitts, 2005).This is not to say that such\nMillian passages are without thoughtful defenders. See, for example,\nInder Marawah (2011). Nevertheless, it raises a question that still\ndivides liberals: are liberal political principles justified for all\npolitical communities? In The Law of Peoples Rawls argues\nthat they are not. According to Rawls there can be a \u2018decent\nhierarchical society\u2019 which is not based on the liberal\nconception of all persons as free and equal, but instead views persons\nas \u201cresponsible and cooperating members of their respective\ngroups\u201d but not inherently equal (1999a: 66). Given this, the\nfull liberal conception of justice cannot be constructed out of shared\nideas of this \u2018people\u2019, though basic human rights,\nimplicit in the very idea of a social cooperative structure, apply to\nall peoples. David Miller (2002) develops a different defense of this\nanti-universalistic position, while those such as Thomas Pogge (2002:\nch. 4) and Martha Nussbaum (2002) reject Rawls\u2019s position,\ninstead advocating versions of moral universalism: they claim that\nliberal moral principles apply to all states.\n",
