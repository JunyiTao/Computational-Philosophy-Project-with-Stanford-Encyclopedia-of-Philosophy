    "main_text": "Testimony\n7. Testimony\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba begins his final chapter of the Jewel with\na defense of the integrity of testimony as a knowledge source,\nfollowing a long tradition beginning with an extended\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra passage (2.1.49\u201356) that elicited\nmuch commentary. Like his predecessors, he resists an opponent\u2019s\ncontention that \u201ctestimonial\u201d knowledge results from\ninference of a certain sort such that supposing an additional\nknowledge source is unnecessary. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s response\nis to argue that testimony works uniquely through language, that\nwithout testimony the inferentialist\u2019s premises in the\nsubstitute inference could not be understood. Furthermore, the\ncertification conditions for testimony are different. The chapter\nincludes much reflection on linguistic meaning, including sections on\ngrammar near the end. How to understand reference is a chief concern,\nreference being viewed as the primary mode of meaning. But there is\nalso \u201cindirect indication,\u201d\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101, which works by way of a referent\nindicating something else, as when a poet says, \u201cThe\nmoon,\u201d meaning the face of the beloved. All these are standard\ntopics in Ny\u0101ya literature. Injunctions, which are also talked\nabout from the earliest by Naiy\u0101yikas as well as their\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka champions (the Veda is injunctive in\ncharacter), command a lot of attention. Their supposed ethical force\nis wrestled with, as Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba shows his mastery of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and resists its view of a moral\nuniverse.\n\nNy\u0101ya and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 are referentialist allies\nwith similar agendas when it comes to knowledge from testimony, both\nopposed to a Yog\u0101c\u0101ra pragmatic theory of meaning. Although\nconcerned mainly with Vedic hermeneutics, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka\nphilosophers pioneer many of the best arguments and counterarguments\nagainst Buddhists and others who attack Vedic authority. But\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba does not accept the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka\ncontention that the overall purport of a statement or sentence can in\ngeneral, even in cases of secondary meaning,\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101, be understood without an idea of\nthe speaker\u2019s intention. We do not have to understand the\nspeaker\u2019s intention to grasp a statement in all cases, although\nsometimes we do, for example, when multiple meanings are possible and\nwith some statements employing lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101. But\nthe M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka view that Vedic sentences have no author\nis false.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba apparently accepts the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra\u2019s definition, 1.1.7:\n\u201cTestimony is the (true) statement of an trustworthy\nexpert\u201d (V\u0101tsy\u0101yana 1997: 14), which indicates\ncertification conditions centering on the speaker. He focuses,\nhowever, on the conditions wrapped up in what it is to be a (true)\nstatement from the hearer\u2019s point of view. The condition known\nas yogyat\u0101, usually rendered \u201csemantic fit,\u201d\nis given by him a broad interpretation, where not only infelicitous\nstatements such as \u201cThe gardener is watering the plants with\nfire,\u201d are violations, as is commonly pointed out, but also the\nhearer\u2019s knowing that the speaker is not an \u0101pta,\nthat the sounds are, for example, from a parrot.\n",
