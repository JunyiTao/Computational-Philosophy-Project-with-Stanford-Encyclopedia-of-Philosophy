    "main_text": "The Discourse Theory of Law and Democracy: Between Facts and Norms || Objections to Between Facts and Norms\n4.5 Objections to Between Facts and Norms\n\nJoshua Cohen objects that the principle of discourse does not amount\nto a requirement of equal liberty, and that nothing so rich as\nHabermas\u2019s scheme of individual liberties follows solely from\nthe application of the discourse principle to the legal form (Cohen\n1999: 393, 398). He objects even while acknowledging that the various\nrights are not yet saturated: they are not yet specific, historically\nand socially determinate rights. But contra Cohen, on Habermas\u2019s\naccount, legal form, or modern \u201cform of law\u201d is a richer\nidea than the mere rule of law, and refers to a complex of features\nthat law has in a modern constitutional democratic state. As Baynes\nand Zurn point out, Habermas\u2019s theory reconstructs the way that,\nvia the discourse principle, the form of law in modern\u2014that is,\npost-traditional and post-conventional\u2014societies functions to\ncompensate for the loss of shared traditions, and relieves the burden\non citizens to reach reasoned agreement with one another and thereby\ncoordinate their actions (Baynes 2016: 166: Zurn 2011).\n\nSome critics argue that Habermas is wrong to look for a justification\nof basic rights that is functionalist, or merely \u201cinternal to\nlaw\u201d, one that sees them only as necessary conditions for the\ninstitutionalization of the democratic process, or one that is\nstrongly constructivist, that begins from slender premises that eschew\nmoral or ethical considerations (Forst 2011; Larmore 1995; Michelman\n1998; Bernstein 1996; and Cohen 1999; cf. Flynn 2003). The upshot of\nsuch criticisms is that Habermas\u2019s justification of the system\nof rights requires stronger normative support of one kind or another,\nand that political legitimacy is not entirely sui\ngeneris.\n\nRawls, Cohen, and Larmore argue in addition that Habermas\u2019s\npolitical theory rests on what Rawls calls a \u201ccomprehensive\ndoctrine\u201d since it is based on a controversial theory of meaning\nand communication and a controversial doctrine of method (Rawls 1995:\n139; Cohen 1999; Larmore 1995). However, there is an important\ndifference between comprehensive philosophical doctrines and\ncomprehensive moral, ethical or religious doctrines. The fact that a\nnormative political theory has controversial philosophical\nassumptions, which almost all do, does not create the kind of\npractical problems that arise when a political system, or\nconstitution, is saddled with controversial moral or religious\nassumptions, and its citizens cannot regard it as legitimate (Lister\n2007). To make that claim is to presuppose that political theory\nanswers to the same canons of justification as political systems\n(Laden 2010).\n",
