    "main_text": "The Phenomenon\n1. The Phenomenon\n\nOur subject is traditionally introduced by means of example. We follow\ntradition:\n\n\nI once followed a trail of sugar on a supermarket floor, pushing my\ncart down the aisle on one side of a tall counter and back down the\naisle on the other, seeking the shopper with the torn sack to tell him\nhe was making a mess. With each trip around the counter, the trail\nbecame thicker. But I seemed unable to catch up. Finally it dawned on\nme. I was the shopper I was trying to catch.\n\nI believed at the outset that the shopper with a torn sack was making\na mess. And I was right. But I didn\u2019t believe that I was making\na mess. That seems to be something I came to believe. And when I came\nto believe that, I stopped following the trail around the counter, and\nrearranged the torn sack in my cart. My change in beliefs seems to\nexplain my change in behavior\u2026.\n\nAt first characterizing the change seems easy. My beliefs changed,\ndidn\u2019t they, in that I came to have a new one, namely, that\nI am making a mess? But things are not so simple. (Perry 1979:\n3)\n\n\nThis case displays a structure common to many canonical examples of\nself-locating belief, which we can use to point toward our subject. As\na first pass: the example describes an agent who is in, or comes to be\nin, a particular doxastic state, where that doxastic state is\ndifficult or impossible to characterize without using indexicals.\n(That is, without using expressions that vary in their denotations in\ndifferent contexts of use, such as \u201cI\u201d, \u201cnow\u201d,\n\u201chere\u201d, etc.) Hence the title of Perry\u2019s paper,\n\u201cThe Problem of the Essential Indexical\u201d (1979).\n\nThe doxastic change that Perry underwent when he realized what was\nhappening, the one that explains his change of behavior, can be aptly\ndescribed (by him, at least), as coming to believe that I am\nmaking a mess. It is not aptly described as coming to believe\nthat the shopper with the torn sugar sack is making a mess. Perry\nalready believed that. Nor (Perry argues) is it aptly described as\ncoming to believe that the F is making a mess, for\nany non-indexical F. For one thing, for any such F\n(the unique bearded man in a blue shirt at Safeway, the author of\n\u201cFrege on Demonstratives\u201d, etc.), we can construct a\nversion of the case in which Perry already believed that the\nF was making a mess, but still persisted in trying to chase\nthe F around the supermarket to tell him that he was making a\nmess. For another thing, it could easily be that everyone else in the\nsupermarket believed that the F was making a mess, and none\nof them displayed the embarrassed cart-rearranging behavior that Perry\ndisplayed after he realized what was happening. So none of those\nbeliefs looks like it explains Perry\u2019s change in behavior. (At\nleast, not by marking off a doxastic state that tends to give\nrise\u2014against a typical background of desires and other\nbeliefs\u2014to that sort of behavior.)\n\nNor is Perry\u2019s doxastic change aptly described as coming to\nbelieve that John Perry is making a mess. For one thing, we can\nbuild a version of the case in which Perry already believed that too,\nbut, not realizing that he was John Perry, still tried to chase John\nPerry around the supermarket to tell him he was making a mess. For\nanother, everybody else in the supermarket could have believed that\nJohn Perry was making a mess, without any of them engaging in that\ndistinctive sort of embarrassed cart-rearranging. So that belief also\ndoesn\u2019t look like it explains Perry\u2019s change in behavior.\n(At least, not by marking off a doxastic state that tends to give\nrise\u2014against a typical background of desires and other\nbeliefs\u2014to that sort of behavior.)\n\nSo descriptions of doxastic states that don\u2019t make use of\nindexical terms\u2014states of believing, e.g., that John Perry\nis making a mess, or that the unique bearded philosopher in\nSafeway is making a mess\u2014don\u2019t seem to capture the\ndoxastic change that occurs when Perry realizes what\u2019s been\nhappening. The sorts of descriptions that do capture that change all\nseem ineliminably indexical\u2014Perry can describe the change as\ncoming to believe that I was making a mess, and we can\ndescribe it as, for example, Perry\u2019s coming to believe that\nhe himself was making a mess.\n\nPerry\u2019s example (among others we\u2019ll soon see) has\nconvinced many philosophers that there is a distinctive category of\ndoxastic states that resist characterization in non-indexical terms.\nOnce one is convinced of this, some questions naturally arise:\nWhat\u2019s the best way to think of these doxastic states? And what\nmarks them off as different from states that are happily\ncharacterized in non-indexical terms?\n\nBefore we move on to more detailed discussion, another classic example\nfrom Perry that helps motivate calling these distinctive doxastic\nstates self-locating beliefs:\n\n\nAn amnesiac, Rudolf Lingens, is lost in the Stanford library. He reads\na number of things in the library, including a biography of himself,\nand a detailed account of the library in which he is lost. He believes\nany Fregean thought you think might help him. He still will not know\nwho he is and where he is, no matter how much knowledge he piles up,\nuntil that moment when he is ready to say,\n\n\nThis place is aisle five, floor six, of Main Library,\nStanford.\n\nI am Rudolf Lingens. (Perry 1977: 21\u201322)\n\n\n\nHere it\u2019s easy to see why the terminology of\nself-location is appealing\u2014Lingens\u2019 problem\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be ignorance about what the world is like.\nIt\u2019s ignorance about his own location within the world. (Another\nmetaphor one finds in the literature: his problem isn\u2019t that he\ndoesn\u2019t know how to draw the map of the world; it\u2019s that\nhe doesn\u2019t know where to place the \u201cyou are here\u201d\narrow on that map.) In many respects, this is a helpful and clarifying\nway to think about the purported special category of belief that\nresists characterization in non-indexical terms: it\u2019s belief\nabout one\u2019s particular location within the world.\n\nYet this way of thinking is misleading in at least one respect: the\nrelevant category of belief is not restricted to beliefs about\none\u2019s geographical or temporal location. If the talk of\n\u201cself-location\u201d is not to be misleading, we have to\nunderstand \u201cself-location\u201d quite broadly\u2014in the\nmessy shopper case, Perry\u2019s problem may be a failure to properly\nself-locate, but it\u2019s not a failure to properly\nspatiotemporally self-locate. When Perry realizes\nwhat\u2019s going on, he locates himself among the (widely\nspatiotemporally dispersed) messy shoppers of the world. Perry\u2019s\nnew belief state is one of self-location in the sense that it locates\nhim in a space of possible individuals, or in a quality space the\ncomponents of which aren\u2019t restricted to things having to do\nwith spatiotemporal position.\n\nDavid Lewis calls the same phenomenon \u201cbelief de\nse\u201d\u2014about the self. This avoids misunderstanding the\nphenomenon as having primarily to do with spatiotemporal location, at\nthe expense of introducing some novel and potentially disconcerting\ntechnical terminology, and perhaps obscuring the respects in which\ntalk about self-location is genuinely helpful for getting a grip on\nthe phenomenon.\n",
