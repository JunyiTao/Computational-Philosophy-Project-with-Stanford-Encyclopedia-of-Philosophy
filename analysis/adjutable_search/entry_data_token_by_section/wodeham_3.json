    "main_text": "Psychology and Cognition\n4. Psychology and Cognition\n\nTo the present day a significant part of Wodeham scholarship has been\nfocused on his philosophy of mind and the sequence of events from\nsense impression to complex scientific judgment. Modern\nscholarship\u2019s focus here is partly due to the fact that this was\na clear area of interest for Wodeham, to which he devoted significant\nenergy. But it is also a reflection of the availability of texts; the\ncontracted nature of the Lectura secunda has focused the\nefforts of scholarship on book I and issues of cognition. In the\nfollowing section, we will try to give an overview of the general\nconsensus and debates of modern scholarship on the process of\ncognition as it is currently found in the Lectura\nsecunda.\n",
