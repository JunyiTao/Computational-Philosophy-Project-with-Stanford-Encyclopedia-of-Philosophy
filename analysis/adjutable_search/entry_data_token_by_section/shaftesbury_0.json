His grandfather, the\nfirst Earl of Shaftesbury, oversaw his early upbringing and put John\nLocke in charge of his education. He would eventually come to disagree\nwith many aspects of Locke\u2019s philosophy, but Locke was clearly a\ncrucially important influence on his philosophical development. The\ntwo remained friends until Locke\u2019s death. He served in\nParliament (before his father died, when he was Lord Ashley) and the\nHouse of Lords (after his father died, when he had became the third\nEarl). Ill health curtailed his political career when he was 30 years\nold. (The standard biography is Voitle 1984).\n\nThe first work he published was an edited collection of sermons by\nBenjamin Whichcote, in 1698. He wrote an unsigned preface to the\nsermons in which he praised Whichcote\u2019s belief in the goodness\nof human beings and urged his readers to use Whichcote\u2019s\n\u201cgood nature\u201d as an antidote to the poisonous egoism of\nHobbes and the pessimistic supralapsarianism of the Calvinists.\n\nIn 1699, John Toland arranged publication of an early version of the\nInquiry concerning Virtue. Shaftesbury later renounced this\nversion of the Inquiry, claiming that it was produced without\nhis authorization, although the details of the episode are\nunclear.\n\nMost of the works for which Shaftesbury is famous were written between\n1705\u20131710. It was during this period that he rewrote the\nInquiry concerning Virtue, or Merit and completed versions of\nThe Moralists: A Philosophical Rhapsody (the first version of\nwhich was called The Social Enthusiast, A Philosophical\nAdventure), A Letter concerning Enthusiasm, Sensus\nCommunis: An Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour, and\nSoliloquy, or Advice to an Author.\n\nIn 1711, Shaftesbury collected his mature writings and added to them\nextensive notes and commentaries (which he called Miscellaneous\nReflections on the preceeding Treatises, and other Critical\nSubjects), naming the the resulting three-volume work\nCharacteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times. He revised\nCharacteristicks over the course of the next two years, up\nuntil his death in 1713. A version with his final changes appeared in\n1714.\n\nThere have been three recent editions of Characteristicks: a\nsingle volume edited and with an introduction and scholarly apparatus\nby Klein (1999), with modernized spelling and punctuation; two volumes\nedited and with an introduction and scholarly apparatus by Ayers\n(1999), with original typography; and three volumes with an\nintroduction by Den Uyl (2001), with original typography, and with the\naddition of \u201cA Notion of the Tablature, or Judgment of\nHercules\u201d and \u201cA Letter concerning Design.\u201d In this\nentry, I will refer (as \u2018C\u2019) to the online-accessible\nversion of Den Uyl\u2019s Liberty Fund edition, citing the volume and\noriginal page numbers.\n\nNot all of Shaftesbury\u2019s writings are collected in\nCharacteristicks. Some, such as Second Characters,\nhe intended to publish but did not complete; this might also be true\nof Chartae Socraticae and Pathologia (see Jaffro,\nMaurer, and Petit 2013). Others, such as The Adept Ladies, he\nmay have circulated privately but decided not to publish. Still\nothers, such as Askemata, he might have written for personal\nor therapeutic purposes rather than for public consumption. The most\ncomprehensive collection of Shaftesbury\u2019s published and\nunpublished writings is the Standard Edition: Complete Works,\nCorrespondence and Posthumous Writings, edited by Wolfram Benda\net al. (1981\u2013present).\n",
