Concluding Remarks\n\n\nEven the cursory discussion we have presented here should make a few\nthings clear about the development of category theory in the Middle\nAges. First, Aristotle's views had an extraordinary impact\nthroughout the period, for his Categories were ever-present in\nmedieval discussions of categories. Second, major changes occurred in\nthinking about this topic depending on the availability of various\nsources and the impact of different philosophical traditions. In the\nearly Middle Ages, Neoplatonic works such as the Categoriae\ndecem were very important, whereas later the influence of these\nworks faded and a more Aristotelian approach became dominant. Third, in\nspite of Aristotle's influence, medieval authors charted new\ncourses, which often went contrary to Aristotle's explicit views;\nwe need only think of the number of categories, for example. They also\nraised questions that were not explicitly posed by Aristotle, such as\nthe way that categories are established. Fourth, there was considerable\ndevelopment in the way in which the general topic of categories was\ndiscussed and the tools used to deal with it; late medieval logic\nplayed an increasingly important role in discussions, the terminology\nbecame more precise, the questions raised were made explicit, and the\ncontroversies were increasingly pointed. Finally, the relevance of\ncategories for metaphysical issues became crucial, so that it was in\nthe context of metaphysical works, such as Aquinas'\nCommentary on Aristotle's \u201cMetaphysics\u201d and\nSu\u00e1rez's Metaphysical Disputations that we find\nsome of the richest discussions.\n",
