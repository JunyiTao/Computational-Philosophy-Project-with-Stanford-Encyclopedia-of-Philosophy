    "main_text": "\n1. The Paradox\n\nCentral to any theory of sets is a statement of the conditions under\nwhich sets are formed. In addition to simply listing the members of a\nset, it was initially assumed that any well-defined condition (or\nprecisely specified property) could be used to determine a set. For\nexample, if \\(T\\) is the property of being a teacup, then the\nset, \\(S\\), of all teacups might be defined as \\(S = \\{x: T(x)\\}\\), the set of all individuals,\n\\(x\\), such that \\(x\\) has the property of being \\(T\\).\nEven a contradictory property might be used to determine a set. For\nexample, the property of being both \\(T\\) and not\\(-T\\)\nwould determine the empty set, the set having no members. \n\nMore precisely, na\u00efve set theory assumes the so-called na\u00efve\nor unrestricted Comprehension Axiom, the axiom that for any formula\n\\(\\phi(x)\\) containing \\(x\\) as a free variable, there will\nexist the set \\(\\{x: \\phi(x)\\}\\) whose members are\nexactly those objects that satisfy \\(\\phi(x)\\). Thus, if the\nformula \\(\\phi(x)\\) stands for \u201c\\(x\\) is\nprime\u201d, then \\(\\{x: \\phi(x)\\}\\) will be the set of\nprime numbers. If \\(\\phi(x)\\) stands for \u201c\\({\\sim}(x = x)\\)\u201d, then \\(\\{x: \\phi(x)\\}\\) will be the\nempty set. \n\nBut from the assumption of this axiom, Russell\u2019s contradiction\nfollows. For example, if we let \\(\\phi(x)\\) stand for \\(x \\in x\\) and\nlet \\(R = \\{x: {\\sim}\\phi(x)\\}\\), then \\(R\\) is the set whose members\nare exactly those objects that are not members of themselves.\n\nIs \\(R\\) a member of itself? If it is, then it must satisfy the\ncondition of not being a member of itself and so it is not. If it is\nnot, then it must not satisfy the condition of not being a member of\nitself, and so it must be a member of itself. Since by classical logic\none case or the other must hold \u2013 either \\(R\\) is a member\nof itself or it is not \u2013 it follows that the theory implies a\ncontradiction.\n\nAs Russell tells us, it was after he applied the same kind of\nreasoning found in Cantor\u2019s diagonal argument to a\n\u201csupposed class of all imaginable objects\u201d that he was led\nto the contradiction:\n\nThe comprehensive class we are considering, which is to embrace\neverything, must embrace itself as one of its members. In other words,\nif there is such a thing as \u201ceverything,\u201d then,\n\u201ceverything\u201d is something, and is a member of the class\n\u201ceverything.\u201d But normally a class is not a member of\nitself. Mankind, for example, is not a man. Form now the assemblage of\nall classes which are not members of themselves. This is a class: is\nit a member of itself or not? If it is, it is one of those classes\nthat are not members of themselves, i.e., it is not a member of\nitself. If it is not, it is not one of those classes that are not\nmembers of themselves, i.e. it is a member of itself. Thus of the two\nhypotheses \u2013 that it is, and that it is not, a member of itself\n\u2013 each implies its contradictory. This is a contradiction.\n(1919, 136)\n\n\nStandard responses to the paradox attempt to limit in some way the\nconditions under which sets are formed. The goal is usually both to\neliminate \\(R\\) (and similar contradictory sets) and, at the same\ntime, to retain all other sets needed for mathematics. This is often\ndone by replacing the unrestricted Comprehension Axiom with the more\nrestrictive Separation Axiom, namely the axiom that given any\n(consistent) set \\(S\\) and any formula \\(\\phi(x)\\) with \\(x\\) free,\nthere will be a set \\(\\{x \\in S: \\phi(x)\\}\\) whose members are exactly\nthose members of \\(S\\) that satisfy \\(\\phi(x)\\). If we now let\n\\(\\phi(x)\\) stand for the formula \\(x \\not\\in x\\), it turns out that\nthe corresponding set, \\(\\{x \\in S: x \\not\\in x\\}\\) will not be\ncontradictory since it consists only of those members found within S\nthat are not members of themselves. Hence the set fails to include\nitself. \n\nA variety of related paradoxes is discussed in the second chapter of\nthe Introduction to Whitehead and Russell (1910, 2nd edn 60-65), as\nwell as in the entry on\n paradoxes and contemporary logic\n in this encyclopedia. \n2. History of the Paradox\n\nRussell appears to have discovered his paradox in the late spring of\n1901, while working on his Principles of Mathematics (1903).\nExactly when the discovery took place is not clear. Russell initially\nstates that he came across the paradox \u201cin June 1901\u201d\n(1944, 13). Later he reports that the discovery took place \u201cin\nthe spring of 1901\u201d (1959, 75). Still later he reports that he\ncame across the paradox, not in June, but in May of that year (1969,\n221). Cesare Burali-Forti, an assistant to Giuseppe Peano, had\ndiscovered a similar antinomy in 1897 when he noticed that since the\nset of ordinals is well-ordered, it too must have an ordinal. However,\nthis ordinal must be both an element of the set of all ordinals and\nyet greater than every such element. \n\nUnlike Burali-Forti\u2019s paradox, Russell\u2019s paradox does not\ninvolve either ordinals or cardinals, relying instead only on the\nprimitive notions of set and set inclusion. Zermelo noticed a similar\ncontradiction sometime between 1897 and 1902, possibly anticipating\nRussell by some years (Ebbinghaus and Peckhaus 2007, 43\u201348;\nTappenden 2013, 336), although Kanamori concludes that the discovery\ncould easily have been as late as 1902 (Kanamori 2009, 411). As Linsky\npoints out, Zermelo\u2019s argument, while similar to\nRussell\u2019s, is best understood as one of a cluster of arguments\nby Zermelo, Schr\u00f6der and Cantor that \u201cindeed\nanticipated\u201d the mathematical argument Russell developed but\nthat turned out to be different in small but significant ways from\nRussell\u2019s argument (Linsky 2013, 11). In any case, the arguments\nwere thought to be of minor importance until it was realized how\ndetrimental they were to Gottlob Frege\u2019s\n foundations for arithmetic.\n\nRussell wrote to Frege with news of his paradox on June 16, 1902. (For\nthe relevant correspondence, see Russell (1902) and Frege (1902) in\nvan Heijenoort (1967).) The paradox was of significance to\nFrege\u2019s logical work since, in effect, it showed that the axioms\nFrege was using to formalize his logic were inconsistent.\nSpecifically, Frege\u2019s Axiom V requires that an expression such\nas \\(\\phi(x)\\) be considered both a function of the argument \\(x\\) and\na function of the argument \\(\\phi\\). (More precisely, Frege\u2019s\nLaw states that the course-of-values of a concept \\(f\\) is identical\nto the course-of-values of a concept \\(g\\) if and only if \\(f\\) and\n\\(g\\) agree on the value of every argument, i.e., if and only if for\nevery object \\(x, f(x) = g(x)\\). See section 2.4.1 of the entry on\n Gottlob Frege\n in this encyclopedia for more discussion.) In effect, it was this\nambiguity that allowed Russell to construct \\(R\\) in such a way\nthat it could both be and not be a member of itself.\n\nRussell\u2019s letter arrived just as the second volume of\nFrege\u2019s  Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (The Basic\nLaws of Arithmetic, 1893, 1903) was in press. Immediately\nappreciating the difficulty the paradox posed, Frege added to the\nGrundgesetze a hastily composed appendix discussing\nRussell\u2019s discovery. In the appendix Frege observes that the\nconsequences of Russell\u2019s paradox are not immediately clear. For\nexample, \u201cIs it always permissible to speak of the extension of\na concept, of a class? And if not, how do we recognize the exceptional\ncases? Can we always infer from the extension of one concept\u2019s\ncoinciding with that of a second, that every object which falls under\nthe first concept also falls under the second? These are the\nquestions,\u201d Frege notes, \u201craised by Mr Russell\u2019s\ncommunication\u201d (1903, 127). Because of these worries, Frege\neventually felt forced to abandon many of his views about logic and\nmathematics. \n\nEven so, as Russell points out, Frege met the news of the paradox with\nremarkable fortitude:\n\nAs I think about acts of integrity and grace, I realise that there is\nnothing in my knowledge to compare with Frege\u2019s dedication to\ntruth. His entire life\u2019s work was on the verge of completion,\nmuch of his work had been ignored to the benefit of men infinitely\nless capable, his second volume was about to be published, and upon\nfinding that his fundamental assumption was in error, he responded\nwith intellectual pleasure clearly submerging any feelings of personal\ndisappointment. It was almost superhuman and a telling indication of\nthat of which men are capable if their dedication is to creative work\nand knowledge instead of cruder efforts to dominate and be known.\n(Quoted in van Heijenoort (1967), 127)\n\n\nOf course, Russell too was concerned about the consequences of the\ncontradiction. Upon learning that Frege agreed with him about the\nsignificance of the result, he immediately began writing an appendix\nfor his own soon-to-be-released Principles of Mathematics.\nEntitled \u201cAppendix B: The Doctrine of Types,\u201d the appendix\nrepresents Russell\u2019s first attempt at providing a principled\nmethod for avoiding what soon was to become known as\n\u201cRussell\u2019s paradox.\u201d\n3. Early Responses to the Paradox\n\nThe significance of Russell\u2019s paradox can be seen once it is\nrealized that, using classical logic, all sentences follow from a\ncontradiction. For example, assuming both \\(P\\) and \\({\\sim}P,\\)\nany arbitrary proposition, \\(Q\\), can be proved as follows: from\n\\(P\\) we obtain \\(P \\vee Q\\) by the rule of\nAddition; then from \\(P \\vee Q\\) and \\({\\sim}P\\) we\nobtain \\(Q\\) by the rule of Disjunctive Syllogism. Because set\ntheory underlies all branches of mathematics, many people began to\nworry that the inconsistency of set theory would mean that no\nmathematical proof could be completely trustworthy. Only by\neliminating Russell\u2019s paradox could mathematics as a whole\nregain its consistency.\n\nRussell\u2019s paradox ultimately stems from the idea that any\ncondition or property may be used to determine a set. For example, the\nproperty of being evenly divisible by only itself and the number one\ndistinguishes the set of prime numbers from the set of whole numbers.\nThe property of having mammary glands distinguishes the set of mammals\nfrom reptiles, birds and other living organisms. The property of being\nboth square and not square (or any other conjunction of contradictory\nproperties) determines the empty set, and so on.\n\nOne early skeptic concerning an unrestricted Comprehension (or\nAbstraction) axiom was the originator of modern set theory, Georg\nCantor. Even prior to Russell\u2019s discovery, Cantor had rejected\nunrestricted Comprehension in favour of what was, in effect, a\ndistinction between sets and classes, recognizing that some properties\n(such as the property of being an ordinal) produced collections that\nwere simply too large to be sets, and that any assumption to the\ncontrary would lead to inconsistency. (Details can be found in Moore\n(1982), Hallett (1984) and Menzel (1984).) \n\nRussell\u2019s own response to the paradox came with his aptly named\n theory of types.\n Believing that self-application lay at the heart of the paradox,\nRussell\u2019s basic idea was that we can avoid commitment to\n\\(R\\) (the set of all sets that are not members of themselves) by\narranging all sentences (or, more precisely, all\n propositional functions,\n functions which give propositions as their values) into a hierarchy.\nIt is then possible to refer to all objects for which a given\ncondition (or predicate) holds only if they are all at the same level\nor of the same \u201ctype.\u201d \n\nThis solution to Russell\u2019s paradox is motivated in large part by\nadoption of the so-called vicious circle principle. The\nprinciple in effect states that no propositional function can be\ndefined prior to specifying the function\u2019s scope of application.\nIn other words, before a function can be defined, one must first\nspecify exactly those objects to which the function will apply (the\nfunction\u2019s domain). For example, before defining the predicate\n\u201cis a prime number,\u201d one first needs to define the\ncollection of objects that might possibly satisfy this predicate,\nnamely the set, \\(N\\), of natural numbers.\n\nAs Whitehead and Russell explain,\n\n\nAn analysis of the paradoxes to be avoided shows that they all result\nfrom a kind of vicious circle. The vicious circles in question arise\nfrom supposing that a collection of objects may contain members which\ncan only be defined by means of the collection as a whole. Thus, for\nexample, the collection of propositions will be supposed to\ncontain a proposition stating that \u201call propositions are either\ntrue or false.\u201d It would seem, however, that such a statement\ncould not be legitimate unless \u201call propositions\u201d referred\nto some already definite collection, which it cannot do if new\npropositions are created by statements about \u201call\npropositions.\u201d We shall, therefore, have to say that statements\nabout \u201call propositions\u201d are meaningless. \u2026 The\nprinciple which enables us to avoid illegitimate totalities may be\nstated as follows: \u201cWhatever involves all of a\ncollection must not be one of the collection\u201d; or, conversely:\n\u201cIf, provided a certain collection had a total, it would have\nmembers only definable in terms of that total, then the said\ncollection has no total.\u201d We shall call this the\n\u201cvicious-circle principle,\u201d because it enables us to avoid\nthe vicious circles involved in the assumption of illegitimate\ntotalities. (1910, 2nd edn 37)\n\n\nIf Whitehead and Russell are right, it follows that no\nfunction\u2019s scope of application will ever be able to include any\nobject presupposing the function itself. As a result, propositional\nfunctions (along with their corresponding propositions) will end up\nbeing arranged in a hierarchy of the kind Russell proposes.\n\nAlthough Russell first introduced his theory of types in his 1903\nPrinciples of Mathematics, he recognized immediately that\nmore work needed to be done since his initial account seemed to\nresolve some but not all of the paradoxes. Among the alternatives he\nconsidered was a so-called substitutional theory (Galaugher 2013).\nThis in turn led to type theory\u2019s more mature expression five\nyears later in Russell\u2019s 1908 article, \u201cMathematical Logic\nas Based on the Theory of Types,\u201d and in the monumental work he\nco-authored with\n Alfred North Whitehead,\n Principia Mathematica (1910, 1912, 1913). Russell\u2019s type theory thus\nappears in two versions: the \u201csimple theory\u201d of 1903 and\nthe \u201cramified theory\u201d of 1908. Both versions have been\ncriticized for being too ad hoc to eliminate the paradox successfully.\n\n\nIn response to Russell\u2019s paradox,\n David Hilbert\n also expanded his program of building a consistent, axiomatic\nfoundation for mathematics so that it included an axiomatic foundation\nfor logic and set theory (Peckhaus 2004). Underlying this\nformalist approach was the idea of allowing the use of only\nfinite, well-defined and constructible objects, together with rules of\ninference deemed to be absolutely certain.\n\nFinally,\n Luitzen Brouwer\n developed intuitionism, whose basic idea was that one cannot\nassert the existence of a mathematical object unless one can define a\nprocedure for constructing it.\n\nTogether, all of these responses helped focus attention on the\nconnections between logic, language and mathematics. They also helped\nlogicians develop an explicit awareness of the nature of formal\nsystems and of the kinds of metalogical and metamathematical results\nthat have proved to be central to research in the foundations of logic\nand mathematics over the past one hundred years.\n4. Russell\u2019s Paradox in Contemporary Logic\n\nRussell\u2019s paradox is sometimes seen as a negative development\n\u2013 as bringing down Frege\u2019s Grundgesetze and as\none of the original conceptual sins leading to our expulsion from\nCantor\u2019s paradise.\n W.V. Quine\n describes the paradox as an \u201cantinomy\u201d that \u201cpacks\na surprise that can be accommodated by nothing less than a repudiation\nof our conceptual heritage\u201d (1966, 11). Quine is referring to\nthe Na\u00efve Comprehension principle mentioned earlier. In symbols,\nthe principle states that \n\n(NC)\u00a0\u00a0 \\(\\exists A \\forall x (x \\in A \\equiv \\phi),\\)\n\n\nwhere \\(A\\) is not free in the formula \\(\\phi\\).This says,\n\u201cThere is a set \\(A\\) such that for any object \\(x, x\\) is an\nelement of \\(A\\) if and only if the condition expressed by \\(\\phi\\)\nholds.\u201d Russell\u2019s paradox arises by taking \\(\\phi\\) to be\nthe formula: \\(x \\not\\in x\\). \n\nDespite Quine\u2019s comment, it is possible to see Russell\u2019s\nparadox in a more positive light. For one thing, although the matter\nremains controversial, later research has revealed that the paradox\ndoes not necessarily short circuit Frege\u2019s derivation of\narithmetic from logic alone. Frege\u2019s version of NC (his Axiom V)\ncan simply be abandoned. (For details, see the entry on\n Frege\u2019s Theorem.)\n For another, Church gives an elegant formulation of the simple theory\nof types that has proven fruitful even in areas removed from the\nfoundations of mathematics. (For details, see the entry on\n Type Theory.)\n Finally, the development of axiomatic (as opposed to na\u00efve) set\ntheories which exhibit various ingenious and mathematically and\nphilosophically significant ways of dealing with Russell\u2019s\nparadox paved the way for stunning results in the metamathematics of\nset theory. These results have included\n G\u00f6del\u2019s\n and Cohen\u2019s theorems on the independence of the\n axiom of choice\n and Cantor\u2019s continuum hypothesis. So let us see, roughly, how\nsome of these methods \u2013 specifically, the so-called\n\u201cuntyped\u201d methods \u2013 deal with Russell\u2019s\nparadox.\n\nZermelo replaces NC with the following axiom schema of Separation (or\nAussonderungsaxiom): \n\n(ZA)\u00a0\u00a0 \\(\\forall A \\exists B \\forall x (x \\in B \\equiv(x \\in A \\wedge \\phi)).\\)\n\n\nAgain, to avoid circularity, \\(B\\) cannot be free in \\(\\phi\\). This\ndemands that in order to gain entry into \\(B, x\\) must be a member of\nan existing set \\(A\\). As one might imagine, this requires a host of\nadditional set-existence axioms, none of which would be required if NC\nhad held up. \n\nHow does ZA avoid Russell\u2019s paradox? One might think at first\nthat it doesn\u2019t. After all, if we let \\(A\\) be \\(V\\) \u2013 the\nwhole universe of sets \u2013 and \\(\\phi\\) be \\(x \\not\\in x\\), a\ncontradiction again appears to arise. But in this case, all the\ncontradiction shows is that \\(V\\) is not a set. All the contradiction\nshows is that \u201c\\(V\\)\u201d is an empty name (i.e., that it has no\nreference, that \\(V\\) does not exist), since the ontology of\nZermelo\u2019s system consists solely of sets. \n\nThis same point can be made in yet another way, involving a\nrelativized form of Russell\u2019s argument. Let \\(B\\) be any set. By\nZA, the set \\(R_B = \\{x \\in B: x \\not\\in x\\}\\) exists, but it cannot\nbe an element of \\(B\\). For if it is an element of \\(B\\), then we can\nask whether or not it is an element of \\(R_B\\); and it is if and only\nif it is not. Thus something, namely \\(R_B\\), is \u201cmissing\u201d\nfrom each set \\(B\\). So again, \\(V\\) is not a set, since nothing can be\nmissing from \\(V\\). But notice the following subtlety: unlike the previous\nargument involving the direct application of Aussonderungs to\nV, the present argument hints at the idea that, while \\(V\\) is not a set,\n\u201cV\u201d is not an empty name. The next strategy for dealing\nwith Russell\u2019s paradox capitalizes on this hint. \n\nJohn von Neumann\u2019s (1925) untyped method for dealing with\nparadoxes, and with Russell\u2019s paradox in particular, is simple\nand ingenious. Von Neumann introduces a distinction between membership\nand non-membership and, on this basis, draws a distinction between\nsets and classes. An object is a member (simpliciter) if it\nis a member of some class; and it is a non-member if it is\nnot a member of any class. (Actually, von Neumann develops a theory of\nfunctions, taken as primitive, rather than classes, wherein\ncorresponding to the member/non-member distinction one has a\ndistinction between an object that can be an argument of some function\nand one that cannot. In its modern form, due to Bernays and\n G\u00f6del,\n it is a single-sorted theory of classes.) \n\nSets are then defined as members, and non-members are labeled\n\u201cproper classes.\u201d So for example, the Russell class,\n\\(R\\), cannot be a member of any class, and hence it must be a\nproper class. If \\(R\\) is assumed to be an element of a class\n\\(A\\), then it follows from one of von Neumann\u2019s axioms that\n\\(R\\) is not equivalent to \\(V\\). But \\(R\\) is equivalent to\n\\(V\\), and hence not an element of \\(A\\). Thus, von\nNeumann\u2019s method is closely related to the result stated above\nabout the set \\(R_B\\), for arbitrary \\(B\\). Von\nNeumann\u2019s method, while admired by the likes of G\u00f6del and\nBernays, has been undervalued in recent years. \n\nQuine (1937) and (1967) similarly provide another untyped method (in\nletter if not in spirit) of blocking Russell\u2019s paradox, and one\nthat is rife with interesting anomalies. Quine\u2019s basic idea is\nto introduce a stratified comprehension axiom. In effect, the\naxiom blocks circularity by introducing a hierarchy (or\nstratification) that is similar to type theory in some ways, and\ndissimilar in others. (Details can be found in the entry on\n Quine\u2019s New Foundations.)\n \n\nIn contrast to Zermelo\u2019s, von Neumann\u2019s and Quine\u2019s\nstrategies, which are in a sense purely set theoretic, there have also\nbeen attempts to avoid Russell\u2019s paradox by altering the\nunderlying logic. There have been many such attempts and we shall not\nreview them all, but one stands out as being, at the moment, both\nradical and somewhat popular (although not with set theorists per\nse): this is the paraconsistent approach, which limits\nthe overall effect of an isolated contradiction on an entire theory.\nClassical logic mandates that any contradiction trivializes a theory\nby making every sentence of the theory provable. This is because, in\nclassical logic, the following is a theorem:\n\n(Ex Falso Quadlibet)\u00a0\u00a0  \\(A \\supset({\\sim}A \\supset B).\\)\n\n\nNow, virtually the only way to avoid EFQ is to give up disjunctive\nsyllogism, that is, given the usual definitions of the connectives,\nmodus ponens! So altering basic sentential logic in this way\nis radical indeed \u2013 but possible. Unfortunately, even giving up\nEFQ is not enough to retain a semblance of NC. One also has to give up\nthe following additional theorem of basic sentential logic:\n\n(Contraction)\u00a0\u00a0 \\((A \\supset (A \\supset B)) \\supset (A \\supset B).\\)\n\n\nIt can then be argued that NC leads directly, not merely to an\nisolated contradiction, but to triviality. (For the argument that this\nis so, see the entry on\n Curry\u2019s paradox,\n section 2.2. Note too that it is not enough merely to retain the name\n\u201cmodus ponens\u201d; it is the rule itself that\nbecomes modified within non-traditional logics.) Thus it seems that\nthe woes of NC are not confined to Russell\u2019s paradox but also\ninclude a negation-free paradox due to Curry.\n\nAnother suggestion might be to conclude that the paradox depends upon\nan instance of the principle of Excluded Middle, that either \\(R\\) is\na member of \\(R\\) or it is not. This is a principle that is rejected\nby some non-classical approaches to logic, including\nintuitionism. However it is possible to formulate the paradox without\nappealing to Excluded Middle by relying instead upon the Law of\nNon-contradiction. We do so as follows: Given the definition of \\(R\\)\nit follows that \\(R \\in R \\equiv{\\sim}(R \\in R)\\). So \\(R \\in R\n\\supset{\\sim}(R \\in R)\\). But we also know that \\(R \\in R \\supset R\n\\in R\\). So \\(R \\in R \\supset(R \\in R \\wedge{\\sim}(R \\in R))\\). But by\nthe Law of Non-contradiction we know that \\({\\sim}(R \\in R\n\\wedge{\\sim}(R \\in R))\\). So by modus tollens we conclude\nthat \\({\\sim}(R \\in R)\\). At the same time we also know that since \\(R\n\\in R \\equiv{\\sim}(R \\in R)\\), it follows that \\({\\sim}(R \\in R)\n\\supset R \\in R\\), and thus that \\(R \\in R\\). So we can deduce both\n\\(R \\in R\\) and its negation using only intuitionistically acceptable\nmethods. \n\nIt seems, therefore, that proponents of non-classical logics cannot\nclaim to have preserved NC in any significant sense, other than\npreserving the purely syntactical form of the principle, and neither\nintuitionism nor paraconsistency plus the abandonment of Contraction\nwill offer an advantage over the untyped solutions of Zermelo, von\nNeumann, or Quine. (Further discussion can be found in Meyer, Routley\nand Dunn (1979), Irvine (1992), Priest (2006, ch. 18), Weber (2010),\nWeber (2012), and in the entries on\n Curry\u2019s paradox\n (sec. 2.2) and\n paraconsistent logic\n (sec. 2.3).) \n\nIt is also worth noting that Russell\u2019s paradox was not the only\nparadox that troubled Russell and, hence, not the only motivation for\nthe type restrictions one finds in Principia Mathematica. In\nhis earlier work, The Principles of Mathematics, Russell\ndevotes a chapter to \u201cthe Contradiction\u201d (Russell\u2019s\nparadox), presenting it in several forms and dismissing several\nnon-starter responses. He then signals that he will\n\u201cshortly\u201d discuss the doctrine of types. This\ndoesn\u2019t happen for several hundred pages, until we reach the\nvery end of the book, in Appendix B! There Russell presents an\nincipient, simple theory of types, not the theory of types we find in\nPrincipia Mathematica. Why was the later theory needed? The\nreason is that in Appendix B Russell also presents another paradox\nwhich he thinks cannot be resolved by means of the simple theory of\ntypes. This new paradox concerns propositions, not classes, and it,\ntogether with the semantic paradoxes, led Russell to formulate his\nramified version of the theory of types. \n\nThe new, propositional version of the paradox has not figured\nprominently in the subsequent development of logic and set theory, but\nit sorely puzzled Russell. For one thing, it seems to contradict\nCantor\u2019s theorem. Russell writes: \u201cWe cannot admit that\nthere are more ranges [classes of propositions] than\npropositions\u201d (1903, 527). The reason is that there seem to be\neasy, one to one correlations between classes of propositions and\npropositions. For example, the class \\(m\\) of propositions can be\ncorrelated with the proposition that every proposition in \\(m\\)\nis true. This, together with a fine-grained principle of individuation\nfor propositions (asserting, for one thing, that if the classes\n\\(m\\) and \\(n\\) of propositions differ, then any proposition\nabout \\(m\\) will differ from any proposition about \\(n)\\)\nleads to contradiction. \n\nThere has been relatively little discussion of this paradox, although\nit played a key role in the development of Church\u2019s logic of\nsense and denotation. While we have several set theories to choose\nfrom, we do not have anything like a well-developed theory of\nRussellian propositions, although such propositions are central to the\nviews of Millians and direct-reference theorists. One would think that\nsuch a theory would be required for the foundations of semantics, if\nnot for the foundations of mathematics. Thus, while one of\nRussell\u2019s paradoxes has led to the fruitful development of the\nfoundations of mathematics, his \u201cother\u201d paradox has yet to\nlead to anything remotely similar in the foundations of semantics. To\nbe sure, Church (1974a) and Anderson (1989) have attempted to develop\na Russellian intensional logic based on the ramified theory of types,\nbut an argument can be made that the ramified theory is too\nrestrictive to serve as a foundation for the semantics of natural\nlanguage. There have also been some recent attempts to obtain the\nbeginnings of a Russellian intensional logic based on untyped set\ntheories (Cantini 2004; Deutsch 2014). It is rather ironic that\nalthough fine-grained Russellian propositions are favored in the\nphilosophy of language, the formal development of intensional logic is\ndominated by Montague grammar, with its coarse-grained theory of\npropositions. \n\nIt is also worth noting that a number of seemingly purely\nset-theoretical principles are actually (applied) instances of\ntheorems of pure logic (i.e., of first-order quantification theory\nwith identity)! There is a (partial) list of these in Kalish,\nMontague, and Mar (2000). Russell\u2019s paradox is an instance of\nT269 in this list:\n\n(T269)\u00a0\u00a0 \\({\\sim}\\exists y \\forall x (Fxy \\equiv{\\sim} Fxx).\\)\n\n\nReading the dyadic predicate letter \u201c\\(F\\)\u201d as\n\u201cis a member of\u201d, this says that it is not the case that\nthere is a \\(y\\) such that for any \\(x, x\\) is a\nmember of \\(y\\) if and only if \\(x\\) is not a member of\n\\(x\\). Does this mean that Russell\u2019s paradox reduces to\nT269? \n\nCertainly the proof of T269 distills the essence of Russell\u2019s\nargument, its pattern of reasoning. But that pattern also underwrites\nan endless list of seemingly frivolous \u201cparadoxes\u201d such as\nthe famous paradox of the barber who shaves all and only those who do\nnot shave themselves or, similarly, the paradox of the benevolent but\nefficient God who helps all and only those who do not help themselves.\n\n\nHow do these \u201cpseudo paradoxes,\u201d as they are sometimes\ncalled, differ, if at all, from Russell\u2019s paradox? The pattern\nof reasoning is the same and the conclusion \u2013 that there is no\nsuch Barber, no such efficient God, no such set of non-self-membered\nsets \u2013 is the same: such things simply don\u2019t exist.\n(However, as von Neumann showed, it is not necessary to go quite this\nfar. Von Neumann\u2019s method instructs us not that such things as\n\\(R\\) do not exist, but just that we cannot say much about them,\ninasmuch as \\(R\\) and the like cannot fall into the extension of\nany predicate that qualifies as a class.) \n\nThe standard answer to this question is that the difference lies in\nthe subject matter. Quine asks, \u201cwhy does it [Russell\u2019s\nparadox] count as an antinomy and the barber paradox not?\u201d; and\nhe answers, \u201cThe reason is that there has been in our habits of\nthought an overwhelming presumption of there being such a class but no\npresumption of there being such a barber\u201d (1966, 14). Even so,\npsychological talk of \u201chabits of thought\u201d is not\nparticularly illuminating. More to the point, Russell\u2019s paradox\nsensibly gives rise to the question of what sets there are; but it is\nnonsense to wonder, on such grounds as T269, what barbers or Gods\nthere are! \n\nThis verdict, however, is not quite fair to fans of the Barber or of\nT269 generally. They will insist that the question raised by T269 is\nnot what barbers or Gods there are, but rather what non-paradoxical\nobjects there are. This question is virtually the same as that raised\nby Russell\u2019s paradox itself. Thus, from this perspective, the\nrelation between the Barber and Russell\u2019s paradox is much closer\nthan many (following Quine) have been willing to allow (Salmon 2013).\n\n\nWe note that there is a first-order logical formula that bears the\nsame relation to the principle about the\n\\(R_B\\)\u2019s that T269 bears to Russell\u2019s\nparadox. It is the following:\n\n(T273)\u00a0\u00a0 \n\\(\\forall z \\forall y (\\forall x [Fxy \\equiv (Fxz \\wedge{\\sim} Fxx)] \\supset{\\sim} Fyz).\\)\n\n\n(We have taken the liberty of extending the numbering used in Kalish,\nMontague and Mar (2000) to T273.) But not all set-theoretic paradoxes\nare similarly related to first-order logical theorems. The\nBurali-Forti paradox is an example, since the notion of a\nwell-ordering is not elementary; that is, it is not first-order\ndefinable. \n\nRussell\u2019s paradox has never been pass\u00e9, but recently\nthere has been an explosion of interest in it by scholars involved in\nresearch in mathematical logic and in philosophical and historical\nstudies of modern logic. A glance at the contents of the 2004 volume\nOne Hundred Years of Russell\u2019s Paradox shows prominent\nmathematical and philosophical logicians and historians of logic\nporing over the paradox, proposing new ways back into Cantor\u2019s\nparadise, or other ways of resolving the issue. Their investigations\ninclude radically new ways out of the dilemma posed by the paradox,\nnew studies of the theories of types (simple and ramified, and\nextensions thereof), new interpretations of Russell\u2019s paradox\nand constructive theories, of Russell\u2019s paradox of propositions\nand of his own attempt at an untyped theory (the substitution theory),\nand so forth. \n\nAll of this reminds us that fruitful work can arise from the most\nunlikely of observations. As Dana Scott has put it, \u201cIt is to be\nunderstood from the start that Russell\u2019s paradox is not\nto be regarded as a disaster. It and the related paradoxes show that\nthe na\u00efve notion of all-inclusive collections is untenable. That\n\\(is\\) an interesting result, no doubt about it\u201d (1974,\n207). \n",
