Biographical Sketch\n\nThe woman who is today most commonly known as Harriet Taylor or\nHarriet Taylor Mill was born Harriet Hardy in London in October\n 1807.[1]\n She married the pharmaceuticals wholesaler John Taylor on 14 March\n1826; she was eighteen and he twenty-nine. The couple had three\nchildren: Herbert, born in 1827; Algernon (\u201cHaji\u201d), born\nin 1830; and Helen (\u201cLily\u201d), born in 1831. John Taylor\ndied of rectal cancer in 1849, and in the spring of 1851 Harriet was\nmarried again, this time to John Stuart Mill. She suffered from\nvarious health problems affecting her nervous and respiratory systems.\nIn 1841, for instance, she lost much of the use of her legs for an\nextended period (J. S. Mill, [TEL], 486\u20137). A tuberculosis\nsufferer, as was John\u2014it is possible that she caught\n\u201cconsumption\u201d from him (see Packe 1954, 360)\u2014she\ndied of a respiratory failure on 3 November 1858.\n\nHarriet Taylor and John Stuart Mill met for the first time in 1830.\nTheir meeting was arranged by the leader of Harriet\u2019s Unitarian\ncongregation, the Reverend W. J. Fox. The two young people very\nquickly fell in love. Their conduct during the long period in which\nHarriet was married to John Taylor would be scandalous by contemporary\nstandards, let alone Victorian ones. Early on, John Mill made almost\nnightly visits to the Taylors\u2019 home, visits that John Taylor\nwould facilitate by going to his club. On the whole, John Taylor was\nremarkably tolerant of the fact that his wife was on such intimate\nterms with another man, but his tolerance did have some limits. In\n1833, at his insistence, Harriet established a separate residence, and\nshe lived apart from her husband for most of the rest of his life,\nseeing John at her convenience. (Helen lived with her, Herbert and\nHaji with their father.) In 1848, John Taylor refused to allow John\nMill to dedicate The Principles of Political Economy to\nHarriet, although the dedication was nonetheless inserted into special\ncopies of the book that they distributed to friends. When John Taylor\nbegan to suffer from the cancer that would eventually take his life,\nhe asked Harriet to return home to care for him. She declined, on the\ngrounds that her first duty was to John Mill, who at the time was\nhimself suffering from an injured hip and temporary near-blindness.\nWhile John Mill eventually mended, John Taylor\u2019s condition only\nworsened, and at the end Harriet did dedicate herself to caring for\nher husband. In fact, she rebuked John Mill very sharply for having\nfailed, while visiting her, to ask about her husband\u2019s health.\nShe upbraided him even more severely for having suggested that she\nmight write to him during an \u201codd time\u201d when she might\nfind a \u201cchange of subject of thought a relief\u201d:\n\u201cGood God, sh[oul]d you think it a relief to think of something\nelse some acquaintance or what not while I was dying?\u201d\n(H. T. Mill, [CW], 360).\n\nHarriet was widowed in 1849, and she married John Mill in 1851. The\nMills spent most of their married life in their Blackheath Park home,\nwith just Haji and Helen Taylor for company. They had already largely\nwithdrawn from society, perhaps due to the gossip that their\nrelationship generated. Real or perceived slights toward Taylor Mill\nby Mill\u2019s mother and some of his siblings after their wedding\nresulted in his estrangement from much of his family (on this see\nPacke 1954, 349\u201357; Jacobs 2002, 117). The Mills did sometimes\ninterrupt their reclusion to travel, separately or together, to the\nsouth of England or to the Continent in pursuit of a more healthful\nclimate. In late 1858, after Mill\u2019s retirement from the East\nIndia Company, they set out for Montpellier, but Taylor Mill\u2019s\nfragile health gave out in Avignon. Mill bought a small house there,\nnext to the cemetery in which she was buried, where he spent a\nconsiderable portion of the remainder of his life. (He died and was\nburied in Avignon in 1873.)\n2. Contemporaries\u2019 Accounts of Taylor Mill\n\nHad Taylor Mill produced a substantial body of philosophical work that\ncould uncontroversially be called her own, we would not need to\nconcern ourselves with what her contemporaries had to say about her\nabilities; we could make our own assessment. Because she lacks such a\ncorpus, however, and because questions about what she might have\nwritten or how much influence she might have had on Mill\u2019s\nintellectual career are so difficult to answer on purely textual\ngrounds, the estimates of her intellectual powers formed by people who\nknew her must be taken into account.\n2.1 Praise from John Stuart Mill\n\nTaylor Mill\u2019s contemporaries offer radically different\nimpressions of her. Mill\u2019s view is already fairly clear from the\nlines from the dedication to On Liberty that were quoted\nabove, but the description of her in his Autobiography is\nworth quoting in its entirety.\n\nAlthough it was years after my introduction to Mrs. Taylor before my\nacquaintance with her became at all intimate or confidential, I very\nsoon felt her to be the most admirable person I had ever known. It is\nnot to be supposed that she was, or that any one, at the age at which\nI first saw her, could be, all that she afterwards became. Least of\nall could this be true of her, with whom self-improvement, progress in\nthe highest and in all senses, was a law of her nature; a necessity\nequally from the ardour with which she sought it, and from the\nspontaneous tendency of faculties which could not receive an\nimpression or an experience without making it the source or the\noccasion of an accession of wisdom. Up to the time when I first saw\nher, her rich and powerful nature had chiefly unfolded itself\naccording to the received type of feminine genius. To her outer circle\nshe was a beauty and a wit, with an air of natural distinction, felt\nby all who approached her: to the inner, a woman of deep and strong\nfeeling, of penetrating and intuitive intelligence, and of an\neminently meditative and poetic nature. Married at a very early age,\nto a most upright, brave, and honourable man, of liberal opinions and\ngood education, but without the intellectual or artistic tastes which\nwould have made him a companion for her, though a steady and\naffectionate friend, for whom she had true esteem and the strongest\naffection through life, and whom she most deeply lamented when dead;\nshut out by the social disabilities of women from any adequate\nexercise of her highest faculties in action on the world without; her\nlife was one of inward meditation, varied by familiar intercourse with\na small circle of friends, of whom one only (long since deceased) was\na person of genius [Eliza Flower], of capacities of feeling or\nintellect kindred with her own, but all had more or less of alliance\nwith her in sentiments and opinions. Into this circle I had the good\nfortune to be admitted, and I soon perceived that she possessed in\ncombination, the qualities which in all other persons whom I had known\nI had been only too happy to find singly. In her, complete\nemancipation from every kind of superstition (including that which\nattributes a pretended perfection to the order of nature and the\nuniverse), and an earnest protest against many things which are still\npart of the established constitution of society, resulted not from the\nhard intellect, but from strength of noble and elevated feeling, and\nco-existed with a highly reverential nature. In general spiritual\ncharacteristics, as well as in temperament and organisation, I have\noften compared her, as she was at this time, to Shelley: but in\nthought and intellect, Shelley, so far as his powers were developed in\nhis short life, was but a child compared with what she ultimately\nbecame. Alike in the highest regions of speculation and in the smaller\npractical concerns of daily life, her mind was the same perfect\ninstrument, piercing to the very heart and marrow of the matter;\nalways seizing the essential idea or principle. The same exactness and\nrapidity of operation, pervading as it did her sensitive as well as\nher mental faculties, would, with her gifts of feeling and\nimagination, have fitted her to be a consummate artist, as her fiery\nand tender soul and her vigorous eloquence would certainly have made\nher a great orator, and her profound knowledge of human nature and\ndiscernment and sagacity in practical life, would, in the times when\nsuch a carri\u00e8re was open to women, have made her\neminent among the rulers of mankind. Her intellectual gifts did but\nminister to a moral character at once the noblest and the best\nbalanced which I have ever met with in life. Her unselfishness was not\nthat of a taught system of duties, but of a heart which thoroughly\nidentified itself with the feelings of others, and often went to\nexcess in consideration for them by imaginatively investing their\nfeelings with the intensity of its own. The passion of justice might\nhave been thought to be her strongest feeling, but for her boundless\ngenerosity, and a lovingness ever ready to pour itself forth upon any\nor all human beings who were capable of giving the smallest feeling in\nreturn. The rest of her moral characteristics were such as naturally\naccompany these qualities of mind and heart: the most genuine modesty\ncombined with the loftiest pride; a simplicity and sincerity which\nwere absolute, towards all who were fit to receive them; the utmost\nscorn of whatever was mean and cowardly, and a burning indignation at\neverything brutal or tyrannical, faithless or dishonourable in conduct\nand character, while making the broadest distinction between mala\nin se and mere mala prohibita\u2014between acts giving\nevidence of intrinsic badness in feeling and character, and those\nwhich are only violations of conventions either good or bad,\nviolations which whether in themselves right or wrong, are capable of\nbeing committed by persons in every other respect lovable or\nadmirable. (J. S. Mill, [ALE], 193\u20137)\n\n\nThis passage and others like it lead Richard Reeves to describe Mill\nas having a \u201clifelong mission to deify Harriet\u201d (2007,\n206\u20137).\n2.2 Detractors\n\nNo one else who knew Taylor Mill personally spoke of her in anything\nlike these terms, as far as we know, and indeed several of her\nacquaintances held her in low estimation. The Carlyles were admirers\ninitially, but they soon had changes of heart. Jane says that Harriet\nwas \u201ca peculiarly affected body\u201d who \u201cwas not easy\nunless she startled you with unexpected sayings\u201d and was even\n\u201csomewhat of a humbug\u201d (quoted in Packe 1954,\n325\u20136). Thomas comments that \u201cShe was full of unwise\nintellect, asking and re-asking stupid questions\u201d (quoted in\nPacke 1954, 315). Harold Laski relates that \u201cMorley told me that\nLouis Blanc told him that he once sat for an hour with her and that\nshe repeated to him what afterwards turned out to be an article that\nMill had just finished for the Edinburgh\u2026. If she was\nwhat he thought, someone at least should have given us\nindications\u201d (quoted in Stillinger 1961, 24\u20135).\n\nThose who argue that Taylor Mill was something less than what Mill\ntook her to be must explain how he was so misled. There is a tradition\nof thinking that, in essence, he was psychologically unable to resist\nher charms. According to Mill\u2019s friend and biographer Alexander\nBain, it was commonly held among their contemporaries that \u201cshe\nimbibed all his views, and gave them back in her own form, by which he\nwas flattered and pleased\u201d (1882, 173). Ruth Borchard says that\n\u201cAccustomed by training and experience to the acceptance of\nascetic, masculine values, he was completely overpowered by her\nintensely feminine atmosphere\u201d (1957, 46). And Laski speculates:\n\u201cI should guess that she was a comfortable and sympathetic\nperson and that Mill, brought up to fight Austin, Praed, Macaulay and\nGrote, had never met a really soft cushion before.\u201d (op.\ncit.). Some writers have even advanced the idea that after the\ndeath of his domineering father James, Mill felt a need to invent\nanother parental authority in order that he might submit to it (e.g.,\nTrilling 1952, 118; Mazlish 1975, 286\u201391).\n2.3 A More Balanced Assessment\n\nThere is obviously a vast middle territory between these extremes.\nTaylor Mill was not often described in judicious or balanced terms.\nNevertheless, Mill\u2019s brother George, who knew her reasonably\nwell, did relate to Bain that \u201cMrs. Taylor was a clever and\nremarkable woman, but nothing like what John took her to be\u201d\n(Bain 1882, 166).\n3. Taylor Mill as Author\n\nPhilosophical reputations are usually forged through producing a body\nof written work. This section will discuss various works of which\nTaylor Mill is or might be the author or at least a co-author,\nincluding three significant works in whose creation Mill credits\nTaylor Mill with playing a major role: The Principles of Political\nEconomy, On Liberty, and \u201cThe Enfranchisement of\nWomen.\u201d\n3.1 Works Certainly Authored or Co-Authored by Taylor Mill\n\nWhile there are several works of which it is possible to describe\nTaylor Mill as an author or co-author with little fear of\ncontradiction, Menaka Philips observes that none of them constitute\nwhat philosophers have traditionally regarded as a \u201cgreat\ntext\u201d (2018, 629). A handful of published pieces, such as some\npoems, book reviews, and an essay on the aesthetic appreciation of the\nseasons that were published in the Monthly Repository in the\nearly 1830s, when Fox was its editor, have minimal philosophical\ncontent. The Complete Works of Harriet Taylor Mill, edited by\nJo Ellen Jacobs, contains various drafts of unpublished essays that\nare in Taylor Mill\u2019s hand on ethics and social philosophy; their\ntopics include defenses of women\u2019s rights and tolerance and\ncriticisms of religion (Jacobs 1998). But while at points suggestive,\nthese pieces are also brief and indeed most are incomplete fragments.\nAlthough these drafts share thematic similarities with the published\nworks described in this section, as well as other works by Mill such\nas The Subjection of Women and \u201cThe Utility of\nReligion,\u201d they do not correspond closely with particular\nstretches of text in these published\n works.[2]\n While little has been written about these drafts, commentators have\noffered conflicting assessments of their cogency and significance.\n(Compare, for example, Mich\u00e8le Le Doeuff\u2019s (2003,\n203\u20134) and K. C. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s (2001, 60\u20131)\nremarks on a draft of an essay on toleration and conformity, which is\ncirca five pages in length.)\n\nIn a bibliography that he compiled of his writings, Mill describes a\nnumber of newspaper articles that appeared from the middle of the\n1840s to the early 1850s\u2014most comment on recent criminal\ntrials\u2014as having been co-authored by himself and Taylor Mill\n(MacMinn et al. 1945, 59\u201376). Frequently, he adds that\nvery little of the article was his. In a like manner, he says in the\nentry for an 1853 pamphlet examining a proposed domestic violence bill\n\u201cIn this I acted chiefly as an amanuensis to my wife\u201d\n(MacMinn et al. 1945, 79). One thread that runs through many\nof these occasional pieces is the suggestion that the law is\nexcessively harsh where the security of property is concerned yet\nexcessively lax when dealing with those who do violence to other\npersons, especially women and children. (For a detailed analysis of\nthe content of these articles, see Manning 2019.) A newspaper article\nor short popular pamphlet is necessarily far from being a theoretical\ntreatise, but Philips (2018, 634) credits Taylor Mill with the\n\u201cgritty\u201d detail in which these co-authored pieces depict\nwomen\u2019s lived experience from a theoretically-informed\n perspective.[3]\n3.2 Principles of Political Economy\n\nMill suggests that Taylor Mill was deeply involved in the composition\nof three works of greater philosophical significance than those\ndiscussed above. The earliest is the Principles of Political\nEconomy. The Principles\u2019 subtitle is With Some\nof their Applications to Social Philosophy. At least a third of\nthe volume is concerned with topics that belong as much to philosophy\nas to economics, including the portion of the work that Harriet did\nthe most to shape, a chapter titled \u201cOn the Probable Futurity of\nthe Labouring Classes\u201d (J. S. Mill, [PPE], 758\u201396). This\nchapter argues that when the laboring class has made sufficient moral\nand intellectual progress, its members will refuse to settle for mere\nwages any longer. They will instead insist first on profit-sharing and\nlater on employee ownership of firms. They will even experiment with\nSocialist and Communist communities of the sorts depicted by\nSaint-Simon, Fourier, Blanc, and Owen. Mill\u2019s\nAutobiography states that\n\nIn the first draft of the book, that chapter did not exist. She\npointed out the need of such a chapter, and the extreme imperfection\nof the book without it: she was the cause of my writing it; and the\nmore general part of the chapter, the statement and discussion of the\ntwo opposite theories respecting the proper condition of the labouring\nclasses, was wholly an exposition of her thoughts, often in words\ntaken from her own lips. The purely scientific part of the Political\nEconomy I did not learn from her; but it was chiefly her influence\nthat gave to the book that general tone by which it is distinguished\nfrom all previous expositions of Political Economy that had any\npretension to being scientific, and which has made it so useful in\nconciliating minds which those previous expositions had\nrepelled\u2026. The economic generalizations which depend, not on\nnecessities of nature but on those combined with the existing\narrangements of society, it deals with only as provisional, and as\nliable to be much altered by the progress of social improvement. I had\nindeed partially learnt this view of things from the thoughts awakened\nin me by the speculations of the St. Simonians; but it was made a\nliving principle pervading and animating the book by my wife\u2019s\npromptings. ([ALE], 255\u20137)\n\n\nAs Jacobs reads this passage, Mill is declaring the chapter \u201cto\nbe written primarily by Taylor Mill\u201d (2002, 207\u20138). This\ngloss, though, seems to overlook his statement that \u201cshe was the\ncause of my writing it.\u201d Moreover, the aforementioned\n\u201cforbidden dedication\u201d of the volume refers without\nqualification to Mill as the author.\n\nTo Mrs. John Taylor, as the most eminently qualified of all persons\nknown to the author either to originate or appreciate speculations on\nsocial improvement, this attempt to explain and diffuse ideas many of\nwhich were first learned from herself, is with the highest respect and\nregard, dedicated. (J. S. Mill, [PPE], 1026n2)\n\n\nEven if the decision to put only Mill\u2019s name on the cover of the\nPrinciples could be explained as an expedient to win greater\nacceptance for the ideas within, there would have been little harm in\ndescribing her as its co-author in this dedication if she were such,\nespecially once the decision was made only to paste it inside copies\nof the Principles given to personal friends. On the other\nhand, though, his annotated bibliography does describe the\nPrinciples as a \u201cjoint production with my wife\u201d\n(MacMinn et al. 1945,\n 69).[4]\n And Taylor Mill was actively involved in revising portions of the\nlater editions of the Principles. For example, the second\n(1849) edition is considerably more favorable to Socialism and even\nCommunism, and the impetus for this shift seems to have been a change\nin Taylor Mill\u2019s thinking. In a letter written to Taylor Mill\nearly in 1849, Mill points out that she now \u201chad marked\ndissent\u201d from a passage in the first edition raising an\nobjection to Communism that \u201cwas inserted on your proposition\n& very nearly in your own words.\u201d He continues, though,\nthat\n\nThis is probably only the progress we have always been making, &\nby thinking sufficiently I should probably come to think the\nsame\u2014as is almost always the case, I believe always when we\nthink long enough. (J. S. Mill, [TLL], 8\u20139)\n\n\nThus while we can be confident that one important chapter of the\nPrinciples would not exist if not for Taylor Mill and that\nshe helped to edit other chapters, it is unclear whether her role in\nthe volume\u2019s composition was substantial enough to merit calling\nher its co-author. It is not even entirely clear whether John thought\nof her as such, and if he did, whether this was true from the start or\na retrospective judgment that he came to hold years\n later.[5]\n3.3 On Liberty\n\nThis brings us to On Liberty, the celebrated defense of\nindividual freedom, which was published in the year after Taylor\nMill\u2019s death. The dedication of this essay, a portion of which\nhas already been quoted, says that \u201cLike all that I have written\nfor many years, it belongs as much to her as to me,\u201d and in the\nAutobiography Mill elaborates on Taylor Mill\u2019s role in\nthe essay\u2019s production.\n\nThe \u201cLiberty\u201d was more directly and literally our joint\nproduction than anything else which bears my name, for there was not a\nsentence of it that was not several times gone through by us together,\nturned over in many ways, and carefully weeded of any faults, either\nin thought or expression, that we detected in it\u2026. With regard\nto the thoughts, it is difficult to identify any particular part or\nelement as being more hers than all the rest. The whole mode of\nthinking of which the book was the expression, was emphatically\nhers\u2026. The \u201cLiberty\u201d is likely to survive longer\nthan anything else that I have written (with the possible exception of\nthe \u201cLogic\u201d), because the conjunction of her mind with\nmine has rendered it a kind of philosophic text-book of a single\ntruth\u2026. ([ALE], 257\u20139)\n\n\nThe entry for On Liberty in Mill\u2019s bibliography,\nthough, makes no mention of Taylor Mill (MacMinn et al. 1945,\n92). Since he used the term \u201cjoint product\u201d in the\nbibliography for the Principles, it is somewhat curious that\nhe does not use it there for On Liberty as well. Mill\u2019s\nletters to Taylor Mill and others also speak equivocally to the\nquestion of On Liberty\u2019s production. In January of\n1855, Mill writes to Taylor Mill from Rome that he has decided that a\nvolume on liberty would be \u201cthe best thing to write &\npublish at present\u201d (J. S. Mill, [TLL], 294). He asks her to\nlook at an essay on the subject that he had written in the preceding\nyear to see if it could serve as the basis for one part of this\nvolume, and says that if her answer is yes and if his health allows\n\u201cI will try to write & publish it in 1856.\u201d In this\nletter, he clearly suggests that he will be the one doing the writing.\n(On Liberty in fact appeared in 1859.) In a reference to this\nprojected volume in a letter of the next month, though, he says that\n\u201cWe must cram into it as much as possible of what we wish not to\nleave unsaid\u201d (J. S. Mill, [TLL], 332). In letters to others, he\nrefers to the essay as his and to himself as the one writing it (J. S.\nMill, [TLL], 539, 581).\n\nIn a recent article, Christoph Schmidt-Petri, Michael Schefczyk, and\nLily Osburg (2022) employ stylometric techniques to ascertain Taylor\nMill\u2019s role in composing On Liberty. This innovative\napproach presupposes that authors have stylistic\n\u201cfingerprints\u201d that can be identified via machine learning\nalgorithms, so that by comparing a text whose author is unknown to\nothers known to have been written by different \u201csuspects\u201d\n(that is, potential authors) the former\u2019s author can be\nidentified. Their conclusion is that several passages of On\nLiberty were written not by Mill alone but by either Taylor Mill\nor the two of them jointly. One limitation of their method is that we\ncannot be any more confident about their conclusions than we are about\ntheir ascriptions of the texts that serve as inputs to the algorithms.\nAs they acknowledge, there is no consensus about some of these. For\ninstance, they assume not only that the chapter of the\nPrinciples on the future of the working class was written\nexclusively by Taylor Mill but that the remainder of the two-volume\nwork was written jointly\u2014even the most \u201cpurely\nscientific\u201d portions. As with the Principles of Political\nEconomy, then, the evidence regarding Taylor Mill\u2019s claim\nto be regarded as the co-author of On Liberty is\nequivocal.\n3.4 \u201cThe Enfranchisement of Women\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Enfranchisement of Women,\u201d published in The\nWestminster Review in 1851, is the best candidate for a\nsignificant philosophical work authored primarily or even solely by\nTaylor Mill (H. T. Mill, [CW], 51\u201373). Occasioned by a series of\nfeminist conventions in the United States, it makes a case not merely\nfor giving women the ballot but for \u201cequality in all rights,\npolitical, civil, and social, with the male citizens of the\ncommunity\u201d (H. T. Mill, [CW], 51). This essay contains many of\nthe same lines of argument as The Subjection of Women,\nwritten by Mill and published in 1869, although it expresses a\nsomewhat more radical view of gender roles than the later essay (see\nRossi 1970, 41\u20135). It maintains that the denial of political\nrights to women tends to restrict their interests to matters that\ndirectly impact the family, with the result that the influence of\nwives on their husbands tends to diminish the latter\u2019s\nwillingness to act from public-spirited motives. Further, it contends\nthat when women do not enjoy equal educational rights with men then\nwives will impede rather than encourage their husbands\u2019 moral\nand intellectual development. And it insists that competition for jobs\nwill prevent most of the problems that admitting women into the\nworkforce would putatively cause from materializing. All of these\npoints are common to \u201cThe Enfranchisement\u201d and The\nSubjection. The major point of difference between the two is that\nwhile the Subjection rather notoriously suggests that the\nbest arrangement for most married couples will be for the wife to\nconcentrate on the care of the house and the children (J.S. Mill,\n[TSW], 297\u20138), a position that Mill also takes in an early essay\non marriage written for Harriet (J. S. Mill, [OMA], 43), the\n\u201cEnfranchisement\u201d instead argues for the desirability of\nmarried women\u2019s working outside the home.\n\nEven if every woman, as matters now stand, had a claim on some man for\nsupport, how infinitely preferable is it that part of the income\nshould be of the woman\u2019s earning, even if the aggregate sum were\nbut little increased by it\u2026. Even under the present laws\nrespecting the property of women, a woman who contributes materially\nto the support of the family, cannot be treated in the same\ncontemptuously tyrannical manner as one who, however she may toil as a\ndomestic drudge, is a dependent on the man for subsistence (H. T.\nMill, [CW], 60\u20131).\n\n\nThis difference is an important piece of evidence in favor of\nattributing the essay to Taylor Mill (although Richard Krouse points\nout that the essay leaves unanswered the question it raises about who\nis to care for the home and the children; see 1982, 169). Still, not\nall of the evidence is on this side. In 1849, Mill urges Taylor Mill\nto finish a pamphlet that she was writing on the subject of women\n([TLL], 13). Yet soon thereafter, in correspondence with the\nWestminster\u2019s editor about the\n\u201cEnfranchisement,\u201d he speaks of the article as if he is\nits author, writing for instance that \u201cIf you are inclined for\nan article on the Emancipation of Women, \u2026 I have one nearly\nready\u2026 \u201d ([TLL], 55\u20136, 65\u20136). In an 1854\nletter, Mill rather ambiguously reminds Taylor Mill that when the\n\u201cEnfranchisement\u201d is published in a projected collection\nof his work it will be \u201cpreceded by a preface which will show\nthat much of all my later articles, and all the best of that one,\nwere, as they were, my Darling\u2019s\u201d ([TLL], 190). If we can\ndraw any implication from this, it seems to be that while the\nstrongest arguments in the article were due to Harriet, Mill was still\nthe actual author. But the preface that actually appeared, in the\ncollection of Mill\u2019s writings published in his lifetime\n(Dissertations and Discussions), suggests (albeit vaguely)\nthat his contribution was somewhat smaller than this; there he\ndescribes the essay as \u201chers in a particular sense, my share in\nit being little more than that of an editor and amanuensis\u201d (J.\nS. Mill 1882, 93\u20134). (He adds that the article\u2019s\nauthorship was \u201cknown at the time, and publicly attributed to\nher.\u201d) In an 1851 letter to William Lloyd and Helen Benson\nGarrison, Lucretia Coffin Mott writes that she had received a copy of\nthe essay from Harriet\u2019s son Herbert and adds \u201cThe writer\nof it was a Mrs. Taylor a widow who has recently married J. S.\nMill.\u2026 Part of it is from his pen. Indeed, she says,\nhe wrote it\u2014he says, she wrote it\u201d (Mott\n2002, p. 209).\n\nDespite the conflicting evidence, today there seems to be a general\nconsensus that Harriet is the article\u2019s primary author. It\nappears in the University of Toronto\u2019s Collected Works of\nJohn Stuart Mill, but only in an appendix and under her name (H.\nT. Mill, [EW]). John Robson, the editor of Mill\u2019s Collected\nWorks, says that \u201cmost of the evidence\u201d favors\nattributing it to her (Robson 1984, lxxv). Some commentators do\ndissent from this view, however (for example, Himmelfarb, 183\u20136;\nWarnock 1996, xxxv).\n4. Taylor Mill\u2019s Influence on Mill\n\nWhatever conclusions we reach about Taylor Mill\u2019s authorship of\nthe works discussed in the preceding section, she might also have made\nimportant contributions to philosophy through changing the direction\nof Mill\u2019s writing in consequential respects. This section\ndiscusses some of the evidence for and against the proposition that\nshe did so.\n4.1 John Stuart Mill\u2019s Account of the Mills\u2019 Collaboration\n\nMill himself speaks to the difficulty of separating his and Taylor\nMill\u2019s contributions to their collaboration in his\nAutobiography:\n\nWhen two persons have their thoughts and speculations completely in\ncommon; when all subjects of intellectual or moral interest are\ndiscussed between them in daily life, and probed to much greater\ndepths than are usually or conveniently sounded in writings intended\nfor general readers; when they set out from the same principles, and\narrive at their conclusions by processes pursued jointly, it is of\nlittle consequence in respect to the question of originality, which of\nthem holds the pen; the one who contributes least to the composition\nmay contribute most to the thought; the writings which result are the\njoint product of both, and it must often be impossible to disentangle\ntheir respective parts, and affirm that this belongs to one and that\nto the other. (J. S. Mill, [ALE], 251)\n\n\nHere Mill implicitly acknowledges that his hand most often held the\npen, but he also suggests that Taylor Mill contributed numerous ideas\nto works that he was solely or primarily responsible for composing.\n\u201cIn this wide sense,\u201d he continues, \u201cnot only during\nthe years of our married life, but during many of the years of\nconfidential friendship which preceded it, all my published writings\nwere as much my wife\u2019s work as mine; her share in them\nconstantly increasing as years advanced\u201d ([ALE], 251).\n\nMill does give some indication, though, of his and Taylor Mill\u2019s\nrelative strengths:\n\nWith those who, like all the best and wisest of mankind, are\ndissatisfied with human life as it is, and whose feelings are wholly\nidentified with its radical amendment, there are two main regions of\nthought. One is the region of ultimate aims; the constituent elements\nof the highest realizable ideal of human life. The other is that of\nthe immediately useful and practically attainable. In both these\ndepartments, I have acquired more from her teaching, than from all\nother sources taken together. ([ALE],\n 197)[6]\n\n\nIn contrast, Mill says that his own greatest powers to lie in\n\u201cthe uncertain and slippery intermediate region, that of theory,\nor moral and political science,\u201d including \u201cpolitical\neconomy, analytic psychology, logic, philosophy of history,\u201d\netc. Mill stresses both the reciprocity of their collaborative efforts\nand their different manners of reaching conclusions:\n\nThe benefit I received was far greater than any which I could hope to\ngive; though to her, who had at first reached her opinions by the\nmoral intuition of a character of strong feeling, there was doubtless\nhelp as well as encouragement to be derived from one who had arrived\nat many of the same results by study and reasoning: and in the\nrapidity of her intellectual growth, her mental activity, which\nconverted everything into knowledge, doubtless drew from me, as it did\nfrom other sources, many of its materials. ([ALE], 197)\n\n\nMill acknowledges that Taylor Mill had very little to do with his\nfirst major work, A System of Logic (first published in\n1843), or with his discussions of the more technical aspects of\npolitical economy. Her areas of interest, clearly, were moral and\nsocial-political philosophy. Within these areas, though, Mill almost\nseems to suggest that his entire project is that of systematizing\nTaylor Mill\u2019s insights and incorporating them within a\nutilitarian framework.\n\nDuring the greater part of my literary life I have performed the\noffice in relation to her, which from a rather early period I had\nconsidered as the most useful part that I was qualified to take in the\ndomain of thought, that of an interpreter of original thinkers, and\nmediator between them and the public; for I had always a humble\nopinion of my own powers as an original thinker, except in abstract\nscience \u2026 but thought myself much superior to most of my\ncontemporaries in willingness and ability to learn from\neverybody\u2026. I had, in consequence, marked out this as a sphere\nof usefulness in which I was under a special obligation to make myself\nactive: the more so, as the acquaintance I had formed with the ideas\nof the Coleridgians, of the German thinkers, and of Carlyle, all of\nthem fiercely opposed to the mode of thought in which I had been\nbrought up, had convinced me that along with much error they possessed\nmuch truth\u2026. Thus prepared, it will easily be believed that\nwhen I came into close intellectual communion with a person of the\nmost eminent faculties, whose genius, as it grew and unfolded itself\nin thought, continually struck out truths far in advance of me, but in\nwhich I could not, as I had done in those others, detect any mixture\nof error, the greatest part of my mental growth consisted in the\nassimilation of those truths, and the most valuable part of my\nintellectual work was in building the bridges and clearing the paths\nwhich connected them with my general system of thought. ([ALE], pp.\n251\u20133)\n\n4.2 Skepticism About Taylor Mill\u2019s Influence on John Stuart Mill\n\nJust as the people who knew Taylor Mill formed wildly divergent\nconclusions about her abilities, so too have different interpreters\nreached wildly different conclusions about the scope and significance\nof her influence on Mill. Some of Mill\u2019s interpreters are\nskeptical that Taylor Mill really made much difference to his\nwritings. H. O. Pappe, for example, questions whether Taylor Mill\nintroduced any substantial alterations whatsoever into the pattern of\nMill\u2019s thought.\n\n[Taylor Mill\u2019s] early writings evince her dependence on Mill.\nFor the later period of their partnership we have no valid evidence to\nshow that Harriet turned Mill\u2019s mind toward new horizons or gave\nan unexpected significance to his thought\u2026. Mill without\nHarriet would still have been Mill. Mill married to George Eliot (or\nto Mary Wollstonecraft\u2014permitting the anachronism) might have\nbeen transformed. Mary Ann Evans might have given him something new by\nway of independent thought and deeper feeling. Yet, considering her\nequality of stature, there would have been no need for him in\nmasochistic guilt to magnify her contribution. (1960, 47\u20138)\n\n\nSimilarly, Francis Mineka says that \u201cNeither he nor his recent\nbiographers have convinced us that she was the originating mind behind\nhis work \u2026\u201d (1963, 306). More recently, Reeves writes\nthat \u201cThere is no reason to think that Mill\u2019s views would\nhave been substantially different had he ended up with, say, Lizzie\n[Eliza] Flower\u2014although his life certainly would have\nbeen.\u201d (2007, 86), and Kinzer states bluntly that Taylor Mill\n\u201cdid not decisively alter the course of\u201d Mill\u2019s\ndevelopment (2007, 111).\n4.3 The Countervailing Assessment\n\nAlice Rossi criticizes this \u201cminimalist\u201d approach to\nestimating Taylor Mill\u2019s influence on Mill when she observes\nthat \u201cone senses in Mill scholars an unwitting desire to reject\nHarriet Taylor as contributing in any significant way to the vigor of\nMill\u2019s analysis of political and social issues unless it\nincluded some tinge of sentiment or political thought the scholar\ndisapproved of, in which case the disliked element was seen as\nHarriet\u2019s influence\u201d (1970, 44\u20135). Some\ncommentators, however, have inclined toward a \u201cmaximalist\u201d\nstance. Chief among these is Jacobs, whose basic interpretative\napproach is to take Mill\u2019s characterizations of Taylor Mill and\ntheir collaboration at face value, although she departs from this\npractice when she believes that there is evidence that Mill may not\nhave given Taylor Mill the full credit she was due. For example, in an\nunpublished essay Taylor Mill writes that\n\nThere seems to be this great distinction between physical and moral\nscience; That while the degree of perfection the first has attained is\nmarked by the progressive completeness and exactness of its rules,\nthat of the latter is in the state most favourable to, and most\nshowing healthfulness as it advances beyond all classification except\non the widest and most universal principles. The science of morals\nshould rather be called an art\u2026. (H. T. Mill, [CW], 141)\n\n\nJacobs takes this comment to establish that Taylor Mill is the\noriginator of Mill\u2019s distinction between the logics of arts and\nsciences at the end of the System of Logic, and she accuses\nMill of having in this case understated Taylor Mill\u2019s\ncontribution to one of his works (Jacobs 2002, 203n27; J. S. Mill,\n[SOL],\n 943\u201352).[7]\n And while Mill states that Taylor Mill learned almost as much from\nhim as he from her, Jacobs appears to think otherwise. In toting up\nthe advantages of the collaboration to each of them, she notes that\n\u201cHarriet administered Mill\u2019s daily life, nursed his ego,\nand provided him with ideas.\u201d In return, according to Jacobs,\nMill gave Taylor Mill little more than Mary Ann Evans got for herself\nby becoming George Eliot: she merely \u201cacquired the freedom to\nwrite provocative articles \u2026 and to be heard as a man, with\nseriousness and consideration\u201d (Jacobs 2002, 129\u201331).\n\nConservative historian Gertrude Himmelfarb also credits Taylor Mill\nwith having made a very significant difference to Mill\u2019s\nphilosophical output, at least during one stage of his life. In\ncontrast to Jacobs, however, she maintains that this influence was\ndecidedly for the worse. She decries in particular Taylor Mill\u2019s\neffect on Mill\u2019s views on liberty, arguing that it was only when\nHarriet\u2019s influence on him was at its peak that Mill embraced a\nsimplistic liberalism grounded on his sweeping and absolute liberty\nprinciple instead of a more nuanced political theory that treats\nliberty as an important value but one that can be limited by other\nvalues (Himmelfarb 1974, 208\u201372). (Himmelfarb\u2019s maximalist\nreading clearly might be seen as a limit case of the approach that\nRossi challenges.)\n4.4 The Middle Ground\n\nTo feel entirely confident about any judgment about how far Taylor\nMill influenced Mill, we would need not only access to her letters\nwhich were destroyed but recordings from inside their home at\nBlackheath. But as with the descriptions of Taylor Mill\u2019s\ncharacter and ability discussed above, there is a wide middle ground\nbetween the minimalist and maximalist assessments. One intermediate\nview is that of Bain, who suggests that just as Mill\u2019s friend\nJohn Sterling \u201coverflowed in suggestive talk, which Mill took up\nand improved in his own way,\u201d so Taylor Mill might have done as\nwell (1882, 173\u20134). Robson comments that \u201c[I]n what we\nhave of her writings, Harriet constantly has her eye on the future,\neven when criticizing the present; she was a woman of dreams and\naspirations, and she must constantly have breathed into Mill a hopeful\nand expansive view of human possibilities\u201d (1966,\n 178).[8]\n What Bain seems to be suggesting is that Taylor Mill\u2019s greatest\ncontribution to the Mills\u2019 collaboration, apart from any writing\nthat she did herself, was to turn Mill\u2019s attention to the\ndefense of a set progressive ideals and causes reflective of these\npossibilities: Socialism, women\u2019s rights, individual liberty,\nand above all a \u201cutopian\u201d view of humanity\u2019s\nimprovability. This is not necessarily to say that he held these\npositions just because she did, which he explicitly tells us was not\nthe case with women\u2019s rights ([ALE], 253n). Nor must it mean\nthat she contributed little or nothing to the arguments by which he\ndefends them. Bain knew Mill extremely well, and even though he says\nthat his friend was under \u201can extraordinary hallucination as to\nthe personal qualities of his wife,\u201d and \u201coutraged all\nreasonable credibility in describing her matchless genius,\u201d he\nis also adamant not only that Mill \u201cwas not such an egoist as to\nbe captivated by the echo of his own opinions\u201d but also that he\nwould only have been stimulated by someone with \u201cindependent\nresources\u201d who had a \u201cgood mutual understanding as to the\nproper conditions of the problem at issue\u201d (1882,\n173\u20134).\n\nRecent work by feminist scholars also makes a strong case that Taylor\nMill may have influenced Mill\u2019s work in more subtle and less\ndirect ways than commentators usually consider. Helen McCabe suggests\nthat Taylor Mill helped Mill \u201cdevelop an emotional language that\nhad previously been alien to him \u2026 and made him acknowledge,\nface up to, and express his emotions\u201d; she describes this as\n\u201cthe most profound influence anyone could have had\u201d on\nMill, since it \u201cmade him into a much more human, sensitive and\nempathetic philosopher than he would otherwise have been\u201d\n(McCabe 2017, 115). And Philips observes that Taylor Mill\u2019s own\nexperience of patriarchy meant that she brought knowledge to her\ncollaboration with Mill that he could never have acquired on his own\n(Philips 2018).\n5. Conclusion\n\nNo firm conclusions have been reached here as to what personal\nqualities Taylor Mill possessed, what if any philosophical works she\nauthored or co-authored, or how much influence she exercised over\nMill\u2019s philosophical career. All that has been attempted is to\npresent the wide range of answers that have been given to these\nquestions. The available evidence may be too sparse and too\ncontradictory for us ever to arrive at definitive answers. Taylor Mill\nmay therefore be destined to remain an essentially contested figure in\nthe history of philosophy.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources": ["</h3>\n<h4>Works by Harriet Taylor Mill</h4>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Mill, H.
