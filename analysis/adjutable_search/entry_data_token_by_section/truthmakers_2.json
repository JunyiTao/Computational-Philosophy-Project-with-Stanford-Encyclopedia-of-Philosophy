    "main_text": "What is a Truth-maker? || Truth-making as Necessitation\n1.2 Truth-making as Necessitation\n\nThis difficulty arises because entailment is a relation that lights\nupon representations at both ends. Appreciating this Armstrong\nrecognised that truth-making \n\n\ncannot be any form of entailment. Both terms of an entailment relation\nmust be propositions, but the truth-making term of the truth-maker\nrelation is a portion of reality, and, in general at least, portions\nof reality are not propositions. (2004: 5\u20136; see also Lowe 2006:\n185)\n\n\nAccordingly Armstrong made a bold maneuver. He posited a\nmetaphysically primitive relation of necessitation (i.e., one not\nitself defined in terms of possible worlds because Armstrong is\n\u201copposed to the extensional view proposed by those who put\nmetaphysical faith in possible worlds\u201d preferring an\n\u2018intensional account\u2019 of modality instead (1997: 151,\n2004: 96)). The relation in question lights upon a portion of reality\nat one end and upon a truth at the other. In the simplest case that\nmeans that the truth making relation is one that \u201cholds between\nany truthmaker, T, which is something in the world, and the\nproposition\u201d that T exists (2004: 6). Armstrong then\ndefined what is to be a truth-maker in terms of this metaphysical\nbridging relation:\n\n(Necessitation-T)\n a truth-maker is a thing that necessitates something\u2019s\nbeing true.\n\n\nThis conception of truth making avoids the \u201ccategory\u201d\nmistake that results from attempting to define truth-making in terms\nof entailment. It also makes some advance upon (Virtue-T) and\nits primitive use of \u201cin virtue of\u201d because at least\n(Necessitation-T) relates the notion of truth making to other\nmodal notions, like that of necessity, upon which we have some\nindependent handle. But what is there positively to be said in favour\nof conceiving of truth-makers in terms of \u201cnecessitation\u201d?\nSuppose that T is a candidate truth-maker for a truth\np even though T fails to necessitate p.\nThen it is possible for T to exist even when p is\nfalse. Armstrong now reflects \u201cwe will surely think that the\nalleged truth-maker was insufficient by itself and requires to be\nsupplemented in some way\u201d (1997: 116). Suppose this\nsupplementary condition is the existence of another entity,\nU. Then \u201cT+U would appear to be the\ntrue and necessitating truth-maker for p\u201d (2004: 7).\nArmstrong concludes that a truth-maker for a truth must necessitate\nthe truth in question.\n\nUnfortunately this argument takes us nowhere except around in a\ncircle. (Necessitation-T) embodies the doctrine that it is\nboth necessary and sufficient for being a truth-maker that a thing\nnecessitates the truth it makes true. Armstrong\u2019s argument for\nthis doctrine relies upon the dual assumptions: (1) anything that\nfails to necessitate p (witness T) cannot be a\ntruth-maker for p,whereas (2) anything that succeeds in\nnecessitating p (witness T+U) must be. But\n(1) just is the claim that it is necessary, and (2) just the claim\nthat it is sufficient for being a truth-maker that a thing\nnecessitates the truth it makes true. Since it relies upon (1) and\n(2), and (1) and (2) are just equivalent to\n(Necessitation-T), it follows that Armstrong\u2019s argument\nis incapable of providing independent support for the conception he\nfavours of what it is to be a truth-maker.\n\nEven though this argument may be circular, does\n(Necessitation-T) at least have the favourable feature that\nadopting it enables us to avoid the other difficulty that beset\n(Entailment-T), viz. over-generation? Not if there\nare things that necessitate a truth whilst still failing to be\nsufficiently relevant to be plausible truth-makers for it. If the\nnecessitation relation is so distributed that it holds between any\ncontingently existing portion of reality, e.g., an ice-floe, and any\nnecessary truth, e.g., 2+2=4, then we shall be no further forward than\nwe were before. So Armstrong needs to tell us more about the\ncross-categorial relation in question to assure us that such cases\ncannot arise. Smith suggests another problem case for\n(Necessitarian-T). \n\n\nSuppose that God wills that John kiss Mary now. God\u2019s willing\nact thereby necessitates the truth of \u201cJohn is kissing\nMary\u201d. (For Malebranche, all necessitation is of this sort.) But\nGod\u2019s act is not a truth-maker for this judgement. (Smith 1999:\n6)\n\n\nIf such cases are possible then (Necessitation-T) fails to\nprovide a sufficient condition for being a truth-maker.\n\nIn fact the commitment already emerges from (Necessitarian-T)\nif the necessitation relation it embodies is conceived as internal in\nthe following sense: \u201cAn internal relation is one where the\nexistence of the terms entails the existence of the relation\u201d\nstrung out between the terms; otherwise a relation is external\n(Armstrong 1997: 87). Armstrong argues that the relation of\ntruth-making has to be internal (in just this sense) because if it\nweren\u2019t then we would have to allow that, absurdly,\n\u201canything may be a truth-maker for any truth\u201d (1997: 198).\nBut then nothing but propositions\u2014conceived in the\nself-interpreting sense\u2014can be truth-bearers that are internally\nrelated to their truth-makers. Any other candidate for this\nrepresentational role, as we\u2019ve already reflected\u2014a token\nbelief state or utterance\u2014could have been endowed with a\ndifferent representational significance than the one it possesses. So\nthe other eligible candidates, by contrast to propositions,\naren\u2019t internally related to what makes them true.\n\nArmstrong\u2019s commitment to the truth-making relation\u2019s\nbeing internal clashes with his naturalism (David 2005: 156\u20139).\nAccording to Armstrong, \n\n\nTruth attaches in the first place to propositions, those propositions\nwhich have a truth-maker. But no Naturalist can be happy with a realm\nof propositions. (Armstrong 1997: 131) \n\n\nSo Armstrong counsels that we don\u2019t take propositions with\n\u201contological seriousness\u201d: \n\n\nWhat exists are classes of intentionally equivalent tokens. The\nfundamental correspondence, therefore, is not between\nentities called truths and their truth-makers, but between the token\nbeliefs and thoughts, on the one hand, and truth-makers on the other.\n(Armstrong 1997: 131)\n\n\nBut naturalistically kosher token beliefs and thoughts aren\u2019t\ninternally related to what makes them true. So Armstrong\u2019s\nnaturalism commits him to denying that the truth-making relation is\ninternal after all. Heil has also inveighed in a naturalistic spirit\nagainst incurring a commitment to propositions that are designed to\nhave their own \u201cbuilt-in intentionality\u201d whilst continuing\nto maintain that truth-making is an internal relation (2006:\n240\u20133). Since we have no idea of what a naturalistic\nrepresentation would look like that was internally related to what\nmade it true, this appears to be an impossible combination of views.\nOur inability to conjure up a credible class of truth-bearers that are\ninternally related to their truth-makers provides us with a very\nstrong incentive for supposing that the truth-making relation is\nexternal. The long and short of it: if we are wary, as many\nnaturalists are, of the doctrine that truth-bearers are propositions,\nthen we should also be wary of thinking that the truth-making relation\nis internal. This spells trouble for (Necessitarian-T) and\nany other account of truth making which invoke internal relations to\npropositions.\n",
