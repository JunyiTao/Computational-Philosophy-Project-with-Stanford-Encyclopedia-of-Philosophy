    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n6. Metaphysics\n\nFacing mandatory retirement in London, and upon being offered an\nappointment at Harvard, Whitehead moved to the United States in 1924.\nGiven his prior training in mathematics, it was sometimes joked that\nthe first philosophy lectures he ever attended were those he himself\ndelivered in his new role as Professor of Philosophy. As Russell\ncomments, \u201cIn England, Whitehead was regarded only as a\nmathematician, and it was left to America to discover him as a\nphilosopher\u201d (1956: 100).\n\nA year after his arrival, he delivered Harvard\u2019s prestigious\nLowell Lectures. The lectures formed the basis for Science and the\nModern World (1926). The 1927/28 Gifford Lectures at the\nUniversity of Edinburgh followed shortly afterwards and resulted in\nthe publication of Whitehead\u2019s most comprehensive (but difficult\nto penetrate) metaphysical work, Process and Reality (1929c).\nAnd in the Preface of the third major work composing his mature\nmetaphysical system, Adventures of Ideas (1933), Whitehead\nstated:\n\n\nThe three books\u2014Science and The Modern World, Process and\nReality, Adventures of Ideas\u2014are an endeavor to express a\nway of understanding the nature of things, and to point out how that\nway of understanding is illustrated by \u2026 human experience. Each\nbook can be read separately; but they supplement each other\u2019s\nomissions or compressions. (1933 [1967: vii])\n\n\nWhitehead\u2019s philosophy of science \u201chas nothing to do with\nethics or theology or the theory of aesthetics\u201d (1922 [2004:\n4]). Whitehead in his London writings was \u201cexcluding any\nreference to moral or aesthetic values\u201d, even though he was\nalready aware that \u201cthe values of nature are perhaps the key to\nthe metaphysical synthesis of existence\u201d (1920 [1986: 5]).\nWhitehead\u2019s metaphysics, on the contrary, not only take into\naccount science, but also art, morals and religion. Whitehead in his\nHarvard writings did not exclude anything, but aimed at a\n\u201csynoptic vision\u201d (1929c [1985: 5]) to which values are\nindeed the key.\n\nIn his earlier philosophy of science, Whitehead revolted against the\nbifurcation of nature into the worlds of primary and secondary\nqualities, and he promoted the harmonization of the abstractions of\nmathematical physics with those of Hume\u2019s sensationalist\nempiricism, as well as the inclusion of more concrete intuitions\noffered by our perception\u2014our intuitions of causality,\nextension, cogredience, congruence, color, sound, smell, etc. Closely\nlinked to this completion of the scientific scheme of thought,\nWhitehead developed a new scientific ontology and a new theory of\nperception. His scientific ontology is one of internally related\nevents (instead of merely externally related bits of matter). His\ntheory of perception (cf. Symbolism: its Meaning and Effect)\nholds that our perception is always perception in the mixed mode of\nsymbolic reference, which usually involves a symbolic reference of\nwhat is given in the pure mode of presentational immediacy to what is\ngiven in the pure mode of causal efficacy:\n\n\nsymbolic reference, though in complex human experience it works both\nways, is chiefly to be thought of as the elucidation of percepta in\nthe mode of causal efficacy by \u2026 percepta in the mode of\npresentational immediacy. (1929c [1985: 178])\n\n\nAccording to Whitehead, the failure to lay due emphasis on the\nperceptual mode of causal efficacy implies the danger of reducing the\nscientific method to Hume\u2019s sensationalist empiricism, and\nultimately lies at the basis of the Humean failure to acknowledge the\nrelatedness of nature, especially the causal relatedness of nature.\nIndeed, \u201cthe notion of causation arose because mankind lives\namid experiences in the mode of causal efficacy\u201d (1929c [1985:\n175]). According to Whitehead, \u201csymbolic reference is the\ninterpretative element in human experience\u201d (1929c [1985: 173]),\nand \u201cthe failure to lay due emphasis on symbolic reference\n\u2026 has reduced the notion of \u2018meaning\u2019 to a\nmystery\u201d (1929c [1985: 168]), and ultimately lies at the basis\nof Newton\u2019s failure to give meaning to his formulae of motion\nand gravitation.\n\nIn his later metaphysics, Whitehead revolted against the bifurcation\nof the world into the objective world of facts (as studied by science,\neven a completed science, and one not limited to physics, but\nstretching from physics to biology to psychology) and the subjective\nworld of values (aesthetic, ethic, and religious), and he promoted the\nharmonization of the abstractions of science with those of art,\nmorals, and religion, as well as the inclusion of more concrete\nintuitions offered by our experience\u2014stretching from our\nmathematical and physical intuitions to our poetic and mystic\nintuitions. Closely linked to this completion of the metaphysical\nscheme of thought (cf. Part I of Process and Reality),\nWhitehead refined his earlier ontology, and generalized his earlier\ntheory of perception into a theory of feelings. Whitehead\u2019s\nultimate ontology\u2014the ontology of \u2018the philosophy of\norganism\u2019 or \u2018process philosophy\u2019\u2014is one of\ninternally related organism-like elementary processes (called\n\u2018actual occasions\u2019 or \u2018actual entities\u2019) in\nterms of which he could understand both lifeless nature and nature\nalive, both matter and mind, both science and\nreligion\u2014\u201cPhilosophy\u201d, Whitehead even writes,\n\u201cattains its chief importance by fusing the two, namely,\nreligion and science, into one rational scheme of thought\u201d\n(1929c [1985: 15]). His theory of feelings (cf. part III of\nProcess and Reality) claims that not only our perception, but\nour experience in general is a stream of elementary processes of\nconcrescence (growing together) of many feelings into\none\u2014\u201cthe many become one, and are increased with\none\u201d (1929c [1985: 21])\u2014and that the process of\nconcrescence is not primarily driven by the objective content of the\nfeelings involved (their factuality), but by their subjective form\n(their valuation, cf. 1929c [1985: 240]).\n\nWhitehead\u2019s ontology cannot be disjoined from his theory of\nfeelings. The actual occasions ontologically constituting our\nexperience are the elementary processes of concrescence of\nfeelings constituting the stream of our experience, and they throw\nlight on the what and the how of all actual\noccasions, including those that constitute lifeless material things.\nThis amounts to the panexperientialist claim that the intrinsically\nrelated elementary constituents of all things in the universe, from\nstones to human beings, are experiential. Whitehead writes:\n\u201ceach actual entity is a throb of experience\u201d (1929c\n[1985: 190]) and \u201capart from the experiences of subjects there\nis nothing, nothing, nothing, bare nothingness\u201d (1929c [1985:\n167])\u2014an outrageous claim according to some, even when it is\nmade clear that panexperientialism is not the same as panpsychism,\nbecause \u201cconsciousness presupposes experience, and not\nexperience consciousness\u201d (1929c [1985: 53]).\n\nThe relational event ontology that Whitehead developed in his London\nperiod might serve to develop a relational interpretation of quantum\nmechanics, such as Rovelli\u2019s (cf. supra) or one of the many\nproposed by Whitehead scholars (cf. Stapp 1993 and 2007, Malin 2001,\nH\u00e4ttich 2004, Epperson 2004, Epperson & Zafiris 2013). But\nthen this ontology has to take into account the fact that quantum\nmechanics suggests that reality is not only relational, but also\ngranular (the results of measuring its changes do not form continuous\nspectra, but spectra of discrete quanta) and indeterminist (physicists\ncannot predetermine the result of a measurement; they can only\ncalculate for each of the relevant discrete quanta, that is, for each\nof the possible results of the measurement, the probability that it\nbecomes the actual result).\n\nIn Whitehead\u2019s London writings, there is no \u201catomic structure\u201d\nof events (1920 [1986: 59]). The events constituting the passage\nof nature, and underlying the abstraction of a continuous\nspace-time, were continuous events. In his first academic year at\nHarvard, however, Whitehead changed his mind. Henceforth he\nconceived of the passage of nature as atomic, as constituted by atomic\nevents. In The Emergence of Whitehead\u2019s Metaphysics:\n1925\u20131929, Lewis Ford had already given an account of\nthe change in Whitehead\u2019s thought from continuous to atomic\nbecoming in the spring of 1925 (1984: 51\u201365). In \u201cFrom Physics to\nPhilosophy, and from Continuity to Atomicity\u201d (Henning &\nPetek 2020: 132\u2013153), Ronny Desmet confirmed Ford\u2019s account\nby means of a close reading of The Harvard Lectures\nof Alfred North Whitehead 1924\u20131925. Moreover, Desmet made\nclear that the main reason for Whitehead\u2019s change of mind was not\nthe rise of quantum mechanics, nor the fact that the atomicity of\nbecoming provided a solution to Zeno\u2019s paradox of becoming, nor\neven that it was needed to include contingency and freedom in his\nphilosophy. The main raison was that\nthis atomicity prevented his philosophy to\ncontradict our immediate experience of the irreversibility\nof time. But no matter its reason, the introduction of the\natomicity of becoming in Whitehead\u2019s philosophy implied the\ngranularity and indeterminism of reality that are needed, next to its\nrelationality, to develop a feasible interpretation of\nquantum mechanics within the frame of this philosophy.\n\nIn Whitehead\u2019s Process and Reality, \u201cthe\nmysterious quanta of energy have made their appearance\u201d (1929c\n[1985: 78]), \u201cthe ultimate metaphysical truth is atomism\u201d\n(1929c [1985: 35]), and events are seen as networks (or\n\u2018societies\u2019) of elementary and atomic events, called\n\u2018actual occasions\u2019 or \u2018actual entities.\u2019\nWhitehead writes:\n\n\nI shall use the term \u2018event\u2019 in the more general sense of\na nexus of actual occasions \u2026 An actual occasion is the\nlimiting type of an event with only one member. (1929c [1985: 73])\n\n\nEach actual occasion determines a quantum of\nextension\u2014\u201cthe atomized quantum of extension correlative\nto the actual entity\u201d (1929c [1985: 73])\u2014and it is by\nmeans of the relation of extensive connection in the class of the\nregions constituted by these quanta that Whitehead attempted to\nimprove upon his earlier construction of space-time (cf. Part IV of\nProcess and Reality).\n\nThe atomicity of events in quantum mechanics dovetails with the\natomicity of the stream of experience as conceived by William James,\nhence reinforcing Whitehead\u2019s claim that each actual entity is\nan elementary process of experience. Whitehead writes:\n\n\nThe authority of William James can be quoted in support of this\nconclusion. He writes: \u201cEither your experience is of no content,\nof no change, or it is of a perceptible amount of content or change.\nYour acquaintance with reality grows literally by buds or drops of\nperception. Intellectually and on reflection you can divide these into\ncomponents, but as immediately given, they come totally or not at\nall\u201d. (1929c [1985: 68])\n\n\nWhitehead\u2019s conclusion reads: \u201cactual entities are drops\nof experience, complex and interdependent\u201d (1929c [1985: 18]),\nand he expresses that reality grows by drops, which together form the\nextensive continuum, by writing: \u201cextensiveness becomes, but\n\u2018becoming is not itself extensive\u201d, and \u201cthere is a\nbecoming of continuity, but no continuity of becoming\u201d (1929c\n[1985: 35]).\n\nIn Whitehead\u2019s London writings, he aims at logically\nreconstructing Einstein\u2019s STR and GTR, which are both\ndeterministic theories of physics, and his notion of causality (that\neach occasion presupposes the antecedent world as active in its own\nnature) does not seem to leave much room for any creative\nself-determination. In his Harvard writings, however, Whitehead\nconsiders deterministic interaction as an abstract limit in\nsome circumstances of the creative interaction that governs\nthe becoming of actual entities in all circumstances, and he\nmakes clear that his notion of causality includes both determination\nby the antecedent world (efficient causation of past actual occasions)\nand self-determination (final causation by the actual occasion in the\nprocess of becoming). Whitehead writes:\n\n\nAn actual entity is at once the product of the efficient past, and is\nalso, in Spinoza\u2019s phrase, causa sui. Every philosophy\nrecognizes, in some form or other, this factor of self-causation.\n(1929a: 150)\n\n\nAgain: \u201cSelf-realization is the ultimate fact of facts. An\nactuality is self-realizing, and whatever is self-realizing is an\nactuality\u201d (1929a: 222).\n\nIntroducing indeterminism also means introducing potentiality next to\nactuality, and indeed, Whitehead introduces pure potentials, also\ncalled \u2018eternal objects,\u2019 next to actual occasions:\n\n\nThe eternal objects are the pure potentials of the universe, and the\nactual entities differ from each other in their realization of\npotentials. (1929c [1985: 149])\n\n\nEternal objects can qualify (characterize) the objective content and\nthe subjective form of the feelings that constitute actual entities.\nEternal objects of the objective species are pure\nmathematical patterns: \u201cEternal objects of the objective species\nare the mathematical Platonic forms\u201d (1929c [1985: 291]). An\neternal object of the objective species can only qualify the objective\ncontent of a feeling, and \u201cnever be an element in the\ndefiniteness of a subjective form\u201d (idem). Eternal objects of\nthe subjective species, on the other hand, include sense data\nand values.\n\n\nA member of the subjective species is, in its primary character, an\nelement in the definiteness of the subjective form of a feeling. It is\na determinate way in which a feeling can feel. (idem)\n\n\nBut it can also become an eternal object contributing to the\ndefiniteness of the objective content of a feeling, for example, when\na smelly feeling gives rise to a feeling of that smell, or when an\nemotionally red feeling is felt by another feeling, and red, an\nelement of the subjective form of the first feeling, becomes an\nelement of the objective content of the second feeling.\n\nWhitehead\u2019s concept of self-determination cannot be disjoined\nfrom his idea that each actual entity is an elementary process of\nexperience, and hence, according to Whitehead, it is relevant both at\nthe lower level of indeterminist physical interactions and at the\nhigher level of free human interactions. Indeed, each actual entity is\na concrescence of feelings of the antecedent world, which do not only\nhave objective content, but also subjective form, and as this\nconcrescence is not only determined by the objective content (by\nwhat is felt), but also by the subjective form (by\nhow it is felt), it is not only determined by the antecedent\nworld that is felt, but also by how it is felt. In other\nwords, each actual entity has to take into account its past, but that\npast only conditions and does not completely determine how\nthe actual entity will take it into account, and \u201chow\nan actual entity becomes constitutes what that\nactual entity is\u201d (1929c [1985: 23]).\n\nHow does this relate to eternal objects? How an actual entity\ntakes into account its antecedent world involves \u201cthe\nrealization of eternal objects [or pure potentials] in the\nconstitution of the actual entity in question\u201d (1929c [1985:\n149]), and this is partly decided by the actual entity itself. In\nfact, \u201cactuality is the decision amid\npotentiality\u201d (1929c [1985: 43]). Another way of\nstating the same is that \u201cthe subjective form \u2026 has the\ncharacter of a valuation\u201d and\n\n\naccording as the valuation is a \u2018valuation up\u2019 or \u2018a\nvaluation down,\u2019 the importance of the eternal object [or pure\npotentials] is enhanced, or attenuated. (1929c [1985:\n240\u2013241])\n\n\nAccording to Whitehead, self-determination gives rise to the\nprobabilistic laws of science as well as human freedom. We cannot\ndecide what the causes are of our present moment of experience,\nbut\u2014to a certain extent\u2014we can decide how we take them\ninto account. In other words, we cannot change what happens to us, but\nwe can choose how we take it. Because our inner life is constituted\nnot only by what we feel, but also by how we feel what we feel, not\nonly by objective content, but also by subjective form, Whitehead\nargues that outer compulsion and efficient causation do not have the\nlast word in our becoming; inner self-determination and final\ncausation do.\n\nWhitehead completes his metaphysics by introducing God (cf. Part V of\nProcess and Reality) as one of the elements to further\nunderstand self-determination (and that it does not result in chaos or\nmere repetition, but promotes order and novelty) and final causation\n(and that it ultimately aims at \u201cintensity of feeling\u201d\n(1929c [1985: 27]) or \u201cdepth of satisfaction\u201d (1929c\n[1985: 105])). According to Whitehead: \u201cGod is the organ of\nnovelty\u201d and order (1929c [1985: 67]);\n\n\nApart from the intervention of God, there could be nothing new in the\nworld, and no order in the world. The course of creation would be a\ndead level of ineffectiveness, with all balance and intensity\nprogressively excluded by the cross currents of incompatibility;\n(1929c [1985: 247])\n\n\nand \u201cGod\u2019s purpose in the creative advance is the\nevocation of intensities\u201d (1929c [1985: 105]). Actually, this\nlast quote from Process and Reality is the equivalent of an\nearlier quote from Religion in the Making\u2014\u201cThe\npurpose of God is the attainment of value in the world\u201d (1926b\n[1996: 100])\u2014and a later quote from Adventures of\nIdeas\u2014\u201cThe teleology of the Universe is directed to\nthe production of Beauty\u201d (1933 [1967: 265]). Each actual\noccasion does not only feel its antecedent world (its past), but God\nas well, and it is the feeling of God which constitutes the initial\naim for the actual occasion\u2019s becoming\u2014\u201cHis\n[God\u2019s] tenderness is directed towards each actual occasion, as\nit arises\u201d (1929c [1985: 105]). Again, however, the actual\noccasion is \u201cfinally responsible for the decision by which any\nlure for feeling is admitted to efficiency\u201d (1929c [1985: 88]),\neven if that lure is divine. In other words, each actual occasion is\n\u201cconditioned, though not determined, by an initial subjective\naim supplied by the ground of all order and originality\u201d (1929c\n[1985: 108]).\n\nFor more details on Whitehead\u2019s metaphysics, cf. the books\nlisted in section 1 as well as Emmet 1932, Johnson 1952, Eisendrath\n1971, Lango 1972, Connelly 1981, Ross 1983, Ford 1984, Nobo 1986,\nMcHenry 1992, Jones 1998, Basile 2009, Nordsieck 2015,\nDebaise 2017b, Dombrowski 2017, Stengers 2020, and Raud 2021.\n",
