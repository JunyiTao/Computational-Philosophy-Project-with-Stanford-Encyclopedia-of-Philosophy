    "main_text": "Rules and Connectives\n3. Rules and Connectives\n\nFor this section the focus will be on rules governing the various\nconnectives, beginning with a deferred topic from Section\n 2:\n the transfer of Carnap-inspired questions of the range of valuations\non which the sequents provable in this or that logic hold to question\nabout the range of valuations on which the sequent-to-sequent rules\npreserve the property of holding. We will also revisit the\nsequent-calculus operational rules from early in Section\n 2\n and look at some of their properties, as well as at some interesting\nvariations on the structural rules which work alongside them. One\ntopic\u2014or pair of topics\u2014raised by such investigations is\nthe issue of the existence and uniqueness of connectives exhibiting\nprescribed logical behaviour (such as might be enshrined in various\nrules), an issue bearing on all approaches to logic and not just the\nsequent calculus approach. Finally we look at a pair of concepts\napplying to connectives as they behave in particular logics: the\nconcept of a universally representative connective and the concept of\na \u2018special\u2019 connective.\n\nBeginning, then, with the preservation behaviour of rules (as in\nGarson 1990 and 2001) it is necessary first to distinguish a\n(sequent-to-sequent) rule\u2019s having a local preservation\ncharacteristic with respect to a class V of\nvaluations\u2014that for each v \u2208 V, the rule\npreserves the property of holding on v\u2014from its having\na global preservation characteristic with respect to V: if\nthe premiss-sequents hold on every v \u2208 V, then\nthe conclusion-sequent holds on every v \u2208 V.\nFor brevity, a sequent will be called V-valid when\nit holds on each v \u2208 V. Then we distinguish the\nlocal range of a rule \u03c1, denoted Loc(\u03c1) from its\nglobal range, Glo(\u03c1), taking the definitions as relative\nto a background language the class of all valuations for which we\ndenote by U:\n\nLoc(\u03c1) = {v \u2208 U : \u03c1 preserves\nthe property of holding on v}\n\nGlo(\u03c1) = {V \u2286 U : \u03c1 preserves\nV-validity}.\n\n\nIt is also natural to define the local and global range of a\ncollection R of rules, by setting Loc(R) =\n\u2229\u03c1 \u2208\nRLoc(\u03c1) and\n\nGlo(R) = {V \u2286 U : each \u03c1\n\u2208 R preserves V-validity}.\n\n\nNote that while the local range of a rule or set of rules is a set of\nvaluations, the global range is a set of sets of valuations. But in\nsome cases there is an especially simple relationship between the two,\nnamely that Glo(R) =\n\u2118(Loc(R)). This happens whenever R\ncomprises only zero-premiss rules, and, more interestingly, when the\nrules in R are interderivable with a set of such rules, given\nthe structural rules (Id), (Weakening), and\n (Cut),[14]\n as in the case of the natural deduction rules for conjunction\nR = {(\u2227I), (\u2227E)} or the corresponding sequent\ncalculus rules {\u2227\u2009Right, \u2227\u2009Left} where\nLoc(R) comprises precisely the \u2227-Boolean\nvaluations. Evidently, the strong classicality phenomenon of Section\n 2\n is making its presence felt here, and we should contrast the\nsituation with disjunction (in Set-Fmla).\nFor R = {(\u2228I), (\u2228E)},\nLoc(R) is the class of \u2228-Boolean valuations, but\nthe same is the case if (\u2228E)\u2014the rule of current interest\nsince it has no zero-premiss equivalent\u2014is replaced by another\nwhich is far from interderivable with it (even given the structural\nrules and (\u2228I)):\n\n\n\n\nA \u227b B  \n\n A \u2228 B\n\u227b B  \n\n\n\nThus the local range is not very informative as to the precise\nsignificance of such a rule as (\u2228E) and it is natural if one thinks\nof the rules as giving the meanings of the connectives they govern (a\nperspective mentioned in Section\n 1)\n and wants to distill this information into a semantics in terms of\nvaluations, to consider the global range. To do so we make use of the\npartial order \u2264 on the underlying set U of valuations (for\nthe language under consideration) defined by: u \u2264\nv if and only for all formulas \u03c6, if u(\u03c6) =\nT then v(\u03c6) =\n T.[15]\n As Garson (2001) observes, the global range of the introduction and\nelimination rules for \u2228 (and again we could equally well cite the\nsequent calculus rules in this connection) is the set of all\nV \u2286 U such that for all u \u2208\nV and all formulas \u03c6 and \u03c8, the following condition\nis\n satisfied:[16]\n\n\n\n\n[\u2228]Garson\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n u(\u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8) = T iff for all formulas \u03c7\nsuch that u(\u03c7) = F, there exists\nv \u2208 V with u\n\u2264 v, v(\u03c7)\n= F and either v(\u03c6)\n= T or v(\u03c8)\n= T.  \n\n\n\nWhile we cannot go into the details of Garson\u2019s program here,\nits aim should be noted: to arrive at the \u2018natural\nsemantics\u2019 implicit in the rules governing a connective # (here\nassumed n-ary) in the sense of a characterization of their\nglobal range as comprising those V of valuations satisfying a\ncondition of the form: \u2200u \u2208 V,\nu(#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n)) =\nT if and only if \u2026, where the dots are replaced by something\nwhich would render this biconditional suitable as a clause in the\ninductive definition of truth on a valuation u \u2208\nV. Garson worries about the use of \u2264 on this score in what\nwe are calling [\u2228]Garson (and has various suggestions to\noffer), as well as about the explicit quantification over \u03c7 which\nintroduces an potential element of circularity or impredicativity (in\nparticular because \u03c7 need not have a lower complexity\u2014be\nconstructed with the aid of fewer primitive connectives, that\nis\u2014than \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8 itself); related concerns are aired in\nWoods (2013). One way of getting rid of the latter feature is to\nmassage [\u2228]Garson into the following equivalent form,\nwhich makes extensive use of conjunctive combinations of valuations,\nand uses the notation |\u03c7| which, for a formula \u03c7, denotes the\nset of v\u2208 V such that v(\u03c7) =\nT:\n\nu(\u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8) = T iff \u2203 U0,\nU1 \u2286 V: U0\n\u2286 |\u03c6|, U1 \u2286 |\u03c8|,\n \nand u = \u220f U0 \u22c5\n\u220f U1.\n\n\nIn place of this last \u201c\u220f U0 \u22c5\n\u220f U1\u201d, we could equally well have\nwritten \u201c\u220f (U0 \u222a\nU1)\u201d, of course. The form as written is more\nsuggestive of the many variations on the semantic treatment of\ndisjunction in the literature\u2014the Beth semantics for\nintuitionistic logic, for instance, and the treatment of disjunction\nfor relevant (or \u2018relevance\u2019) and other substructural\nlogics to be found in Ono and Komori (1985), Or\u0142owska (1985,\n455), and Bell (1986), to cite only some papers\nfrom the 1980s.[17]\nWe will not discuss other\nconnectives from this perspective here, or comment further on\nGarson\u2019s program. See Garson (2001) for a discussion of the\nglobal ranges of the usual sets of introduction and elimination rules\nfor \u2192, \u00ac and\n \u2194.[18]\n Garson\u2019s approach to these matters has, it should be noted,\nundergone further evolution since the publications cited in this\ndiscussion: see Garson (2013).\n\nThe idea which, has just re-surfaced in our discussion, apropos of\nGarson, that the natural deduction introduction and elimination rules\ntogether, or perhaps just the introduction rules alone\n(Gentzen\u2019s preferred\n position),[19]\n somehow fix the meanings of the connectives they govern, often goes\nhand in hand with considerations of the existence and the uniqueness\nof a connective answering to the said rules, considerations first\nraised by H. Hi\u017c, according to Belnap (1962). Belnap was replying\nto Prior (1960) in which the idea that any old set of rules could be\nstipulated to fix the meaning of a proposed connective, was contested\nwith the aid of the subsequently much-discussed example Tonk,\na supposed binary connective for which an\nintroduction rule allowed the passage from (arbitrary) \u03c6 to \u03c6\nTonk \u03c8, as with \u2228-introduction from the\nfirst disjunct, and an elimination rule allowed the passage from \u03c6\nTonk \u03c8 to \u03c8, as with \u2227-elimination\nto the second conjunct. (This was the point anticipated in \u00a72\nwhen the Tonk problem was mentioned apropos of\nthe dual to hybridizing conjunction and disjunction.) Since this\nallowed, by successively applying (Tonk-I) and\nthen (Tonk-E), any \u03c8 to be derived from\nany \u03c6, Prior took this to show that no coherent meaning had been\nconferred on Tonk by the proposed rules, and\nto refute the general thesis that the meaning of a connective can be\nfixed by means of rules governing it. (Prior saw Popper and Kneale as\nthe targets of his argument, which does not touch Gentzen\u2019s view\nthat the meaning is fixed by the totality of introduction rules for a\nconnective, coupled with the fact that these are the totality of such\nrules. Since there is only the one way of introducing Tonk,\nnamely that provided by (Tonk-I),\nwhere the premiss is \u03c6 the meaning of\n\u03c6 Tonk \u03c8 is simply that of \u03c6 and\nthe appropriate elimination rule is not that given by Prior\nbut rather one licensing an elimination to the first\n\u201ctonkjunct\u201d.) Belnap responded that what was wrong with\nPrior\u2019s Tonk rules was that a proof\nsystem antecedently endorsed for the connectives in use would be\nnon-conservatively extended by the enrichment of the language with\nTonk in tandem with supplementing the proof\nsystem with the (Tonk-I) and then (Tonk-E),\nsince they allow the derivation of the\nsequent \u03c6 \u227b \u03c8 even for Tonk-free\n\u03c6,\n \u03c8.[20]\n Later in this section, we return to Tonk and\nexamine its behaviour in a sequent calculus setting.\n\nOf course, one expects the addition of new rules to make for the\nprovability of new sequents, but the extension should be\nconservative in the sense that no new sequents exclusively\ninvolving the old vocabulary become provable. Belnap\u2019s\ndiscussion suggests that the existence of a connective obeying certain\nrules should be conceded by someone endorsing a particular proof\nsystem if and only if the addition of that connective to the language\nand those rules to the proof system yields a conservative extension.\n(There are other things one might mean by the question of whether from\nthe perspective of a given logic, a connective with such-and-such\nlogical powers exists\u2014most evidently, whether or not such a\nconnective is already definable in the logic. Showing that rules\nascribing the powers in question would extend the logic\nnon-conservatively would be one dramatic way of showing no such\nconnective to be definable, but since it could fail to be definable\nwhile still being conservatively addable, the questions need to be\nkept distinct.)\n\nOne snag for such a suggestion is that examples can be found involving two connectives with associated sets of rules\neach of which sets of rules yields a conservative extension of an initial proof system,\napparently requiring the answer \u201cyes, there does exist such a\nconnective\u201d in each case from the perspective of that original system, while extending the initial proof system with\nboth sets of rules at once is non-conservative\u2014undermining this double\nendorsement.[21] We may conclude that while yielding a non-conservative\nextension of a favoured proof system is sufficient to denying the\nexistence or intelligibility of a connective with such-and-such\nlogical properties, there may be other grounds for returning such a\nverdict. Boolean negation comes under just such a critique in Chapter\n5 of Priest (2006), where such problems for Belnap\u2019s account are\nraised and references to the technical literature establishing the\nconservativity of extending certain logics in the relevance tradition\nwith suitable principles governing this connection can also be found.\n(For an earlier presentation of this point, see also Belnap and Dunn\n1981, p. 344, and for a related discussion, Restall 1993, esp.\n\u00a75.) It should be noted also that the conservativity test raises\nissues of its own, independently of the question of whether passing it\nis necessary and sufficient (and what we have been querying is the\nsufficiency half of this package) for acknowledging the existence of a\nconnective. For example, there are sentential connectives which\nconservatively extend intuitionistic propositional logic in\nany of its conventional presentations as a proof system, but\nnon-conservatively extend intuitionistic predicate logic. The\nbest known is dual intuitionistic implication (see\nL\u00f3pez-Escobar\n 1985).[22]\n Returning to the conservative extension criterion of existence, let\nus note that a related connective, dual intuitionistic negation, can\nbe added conservatively to intuitionistic predicate (and a\nfortiori propositional logic) but already at the propositional\nlevel produces violations of the disjunction\nproperty\u2014that \u227b\u00a0\u03c6 \u2228\n\u03c8 should only be provable if at least one of\n\u227b\u00a0\u03c6, \u227b\u00a0\u03c8, is provable\u2014which on\nsome accounts (e.g., Gabbay 1977 and 1981) renders it illegitimate\nfrom an intuitionistic perspective. Finally, it should be observed\nthat an adherent of intuitionistic logic might be expected to take a\ndim view of a proposed new connective with rules conservatively\nextending that logic but not conserving synonymies, in the sense that\nformulas in the original language which are synonymous according to\n\u22a2I\u2009L are no\nlonger so according to the consequence relation associated with the\nextended proof system. This happens in at least the most\nstraightforward extension of intuitionistic logic by what is called\nstrong\n negation.[23]\n\nThe issue of uniqueness, as opposed to existence, of connectives (in\nthe logically loaded sense of the term, naturally) is best approached\nby considering when a collection of rules governing a connective\nuniquely characterize that connective in the sense that if\naccompanied by corresponding rules governing a \u2018duplicate\u2019\nversion of that connective (of the same arity) result in the synonymy\nof compounds formed from the appropriately many components and the\noriginal connective with compounds formed from the duplicate\nconnective from the same components. In a congruential setting the\nreference to synonymy can be replaced by one of equivalence, in the\nsense of \u22a3\u22a2-equivalence in the consequence relation or\nSet-Fmla framework,\nwith suitable variations for other frameworks. Without the assumption\nof congruentiality one should perhaps distinguish unique\ncharacterization to within synonymy from unique characterization to\nwithin equivalence. And because the rules in question may not be pure,\nbut involve other connectives, it may be necessary to speak of # being\nuniquely characterized (by the given rules) in terms of the\nother connectives involved, so that when the reduplicated system is\nconsidered, # is replaced by its duplicate, #\u2032, say, while the\nother connectives remain as they are. We will not be considering these\ncomplications here. It is easy to see that the natural deduction rules\nfor the various connectives given in Section\n 2\n as well as the sequent calculus rules all uniquely characterize the\nconnectives they govern. (Note that, since this includes the\nintroduction and elimination rules for \u2192, which are shared by any\nnatural deduction system for intuitionistic logic, the rules may\nuniquely characterize a connective which is not fully\ndetermined\u2014not amenable to a truth-functional interpretation.\nThe same applies in respect of negation, though we did not cover this\nin our discussion of natural deduction.) This feature is sometimes\nregarded as necessary for the connectives concerned to be regarded as\nlogical constants, although, as explained in Section\n 1,\n we are not pursuing that issue here.\n\nA related issue involving both uniqueness and existence does deserve\nattention, however, arising over competition between logics, differing\non the rules governing a connective where the first logic has rules\nwhich suffice to characterize uniquely a connective and the second has\nall these and more governing that connective. The standard example of\nthis is provided by intuitionistic logic and classical logic in\nrespect of negation. The fact that the classical rules go beyond the\nintuitionistic rules and yet the latter already suffice for unique\ncharacterization means that there is no \u2018live and let\nlive\u2019 option available for the intuitionist, of recognising that\nthe intelligibility of two distinct negation connectives, classical\nand intuitionistic, which can cohabit in the same proof system each\nwith their respect rules. This should be possible according to those\nwho think that any difference in the logical principles governing a\nconnective reflect a difference as to what is meant by the connective\n(W. V. Quine\u2019s view\u2014see Section\n 5\n below), since once a difference in meaning is acknowledged, the\npreviously ambiguous connective, \u201c\u00ac\u201d, in the present\ninstance, should be replaceable by connectives registering the\ndisambiguation\u2014\u00aci and \u00acc,\nsay\u2014and the intuitionistic and classical logician should be able\nto use whichever they take a special interest in, with no further fear\nof talking at cross-purposes in each other\u2019s company. But of\ncourse this is not a possibility, since the rules governing\n\u00aci characterize it uniquely and those governing\n\u00acc duplicate them\u2014think of \u00acc as\n\u00aci\u2032, in terms of the above\ndiscussion\u2014and do more (securing the provability of\n\u00acc\u00accp \u227b p, for\nexample). The result is that the two connectives form equivalent\ncompounds in the reduplicated system and all of the intuitionistically\nunwanted properties of \u00acc spill over to infect\n\u00aci: we can now prove \u00aci\n\u00acip \u227b p, and so on. The\nconciliatory offer of a purportedly disambiguating notation along\nthese lines is one no advocate of intuitionistic logic can afford to\naccept. (By imposing restrictions on some of the intuitionistic rules,\none can produce candidates for the title of \u2018combined\nclassical-and-intuitionistic proof system\u2019\u2014as, for\nexample, in Fari\u00f1as del Cerro and Herzig (2001)\u2014but,\nespecially on views according to which the rules of one\u2019s logic\narticulate the meanings of the connectives they govern, resistance to\nany such restrictions is entirely understandable. Imagine an encounter\nwith aliens in which they told us that to explain what they meant by\nsome items of their vocabulary we had to be prepared to restrict the\nprinciple that \u03c8 followed from \u03c6 and \u03c8 for\ncertain choices of \u03c8 involving translations of that vocabulary\ninto English.)\n\nThe above line of thought points in some interesting further\ndirections. For example, the intuitionistic natural deduction rules\ngoverning \u2227 (in Set-Fmla),\nwhich are the same as the classical ones, are\nthemselves stronger than the following\n rules:[24]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c7 \u227b \u03c6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u03c7 \u227b \u03c8\n \n\n \u03c7 \u227b \u03c6 \u2227\n\u03c8  \n \n\n\n\n\n\u03c7 \u227b \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8  \n\n \u03c7 \u227b \u03c6 \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u03c7 \u227b \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8  \n\n \u03c7 \u227b \u03c8 \n\n  \n\n\n\nWe can take the intuitionistic (and classical) rules to differ from\nthese in replacing the formula variable \u03c7 with a set-of-formulas\nvariable \u0393. The latter set is stronger in the sense that there\nare sequents provable with its rules (e.g., p, q\n\u227b p \u2227 q) which are not provable on the\nbasis of the displayed rules (together with the standard structural\nrules, if desired). But clearly the displayed rules uniquely\ncharacterize \u2227, since, once we reduplicate them for \u2227\u2032,\nwe can take \u03c7 in the second and third (collectively,\n(\u2227E)-style) rules to be \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8, to derive both \u03c6\n\u2227 \u03c8 \u227b \u03c6 and \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 \u227b \u03c8, from\nwhich by the reduplicated version of the first\n(\u201c(\u2227\u2032I)\u201d) rule we derive \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8\n\u227b \u03c6 \u2227\u2032 \u03c8\u2014with a similar derivation for\nthe converse sequent.\n\nThis example may seem far-fetched from the point of view of\nmotivation, but the dialectical upshot is clear\u2014if the \u00ac\nrules are objectionable in being stronger than needed for unique\ncharacterization, the same holds for the intuitionistic \u2227 rules;\nin any case there are in fact variations on this theme is that have\nbeen seriously proposed as weakenings of classical (or intuitionistic)\nlogic in the construction of quantum (or ortho-) logic, in which the\nrule (\u2228E) is subjected to restrictions blocking arbitrary sets of\nside-formulas\u2014the \u0394 and \u03b8 of our formulation of this\nrule in Section\n 2\u2014exactly\n as with the \u2227 rules inset above (which would be fully general in\nthe respect at issue if our chosen framework were what would naturally\nbe called Fmla-Fmla, a\nframework occasionally used for logical\n investigations).[25]\n One could explore the idea of a requirement that all rules should be\nmaximally general in respect of side formulas, to resist such\npressures to weaken the intuitionistic rules, though what this amounts\nto depends on the logical framework, and it may be hard to hold the\nline without succumbing to a similar pull in the direction of\ngenerality which would take us over from Set-Fmla\nto Set-Set.\n\nThe sensitivity to logical framework of issues of unique\ncharacterization is well illustrated with the case of modal logic. It\nis possible to fabricate special purpose logical frameworks which\nallow for the formulation of rules uniquely characterizing \u2610 in\nall normal modal logics (Blamey and Humberstone 1991), but without\nsuch exotic devices, unique characterization is limited to the case in\nwhich \u2610 is fully determined\u2014among the normal modal\nlogics, then, just to that for which \u22a2 \u2610\u03c6 for all\n\u03c6, and that in which \u03c6 \u22a3\u22a2 \u2610\u03c6 for all\n\u03c6.\n (Note  34 is relevant here. The \u201c\u22a2\u201d just used stands for the\nlocal consequence relation concerned so we could equally well have\nwritten, \u201c\u22a2 \u03c6 \u2194 \u2610 \u03c6\u201d. Even more\nexotic logical frameworks for modal logic \u2013 taking us further still from the idea of an argument with premisses and\nconclusion(s), that is \u2013 have been proposed than that just alluded to, several of which are described in Poggiolesi and Restall 2012\nand in the literature cited in their bibliography.)\n\nThis same framework-sensitivity issue can be illustrated by\nconsidering substructural logics in multiset-based frameworks.\nClassical Linear Logic has two versions of the propositional constants\n(or 0-ary connectives) \u22a5 and \u22a4, called (in the relevance\ntradition\u2014see Avron 1988\u2014rather than in the notation of\nthe seminal paper Girard 1987) F and f in the\nformer case and T and t in the latter, with the\nfollowing Mset-Mset\nrules, the Greek letters now standing for finite multisets of formulas\n(and commas for multiset union):\n\n\n\n (F Left)\n\n \u0393, F\n\u227b \u0394\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(T\nRight) \n \u0393 \u227b\nT, \u0394  \n\n (t Left)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u0394  \n\n \u0393, t \u227b\n\u0394  \n \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(t\nRight) \n \u227b t\n \n\n (f Left)\n\n f \u227b\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(f\nRight) \n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u0394  \n\n \u0393 \u227b f,\n\u0394  \n  \n\n\n\nIf we were doing classical logic with multisets, we would need the\nstructural rules (Id), (Weakening) and (Cut) from Section\n 2,\n set-variables now reinterpreted as multiset variables, and the\nfurther rule of Contraction to allow double occurrences of formulas on\nthe left or right of the \u227b to be replaced by single occurrences.\nFor linear logic we retain only (Id) and (Cut), disallowing weakenings\nand contractions, which has the effect that there are now also two\nversions of conjunction and of disjunction, multiplicative and\nadditive\u2014into which distinction we cannot go further here,\nexcept to say that for binary connectives it lines up with the\nintensional/extensional distinction in the relevance\n tradition.[26]\n A sequent calculus presentation of the favoured logic from this\ntradition, R, can be obtained from that for Classical Linear\nLogic (without two of its characteristic 1-ary connectives, called\nexponentials, which are there to mark formulas for which weakening and\ncontraction are permitted) by allowing contraction (while still\nbanning\n weakening).[27]\n We return to R in Example 6 of Section\n 4;\n it is for the sake of that return that the rules governing t\nand T have been given here alongside those for f and\nF, the latter pair being of current interest. Notice that\neven though there is only one rule for F, namely a left\ninsertion rule (with no premiss sequents), this rule suffices to\ncharacterize F uniquely, since in the combined language with\nF\u2032 governed by a like rule we can prove\u2014just by\nappealing to the appropriate instance of the rule F \u227b\nF\u2032 and F\u2032 \u227b F. The weaker\nsystem of Intuitionistic Linear Logic is cast in the framework Mset-Fmla0\ndisallowing the appearance of more than one formula on the right, and\nthis application of the left rule for F is available there,\nas also in Mset-Fmla,\nrequiring exactly one formula on the right (since we have exactly one\nformula\u2014F or F\u2032\u2014there in the\npresent case). When we turn to f, again we find that the\nrules uniquely characterize this connective, since (f Left)\nprovides the premiss for an application of (f\u2032 Right)\nwith \u0393 consisting of (one occurrence of) f and \u0394\nempty, yielding f \u227b f\u2032, with the\nconverse proved similarly. (Note that while F \u227b\nf is a special case of the (left) rule for F, there\nis no proof of the converse sequent. One cannot begin with f\n\u227b and then weaken in an F on the right, since we do not\nhave\n Weakening.[28])\n Again, these derivations go through in Mset-Fmla0,\nbut\nthis time we note that they do not go through in Mset-Fmla,\nsince the left\ninsertion rule has no applications in that framework. When attention\nis restricted to Mset-Fmla,\nthere is no set of pure rules available which\nuniquely characterize f. The Mset-Mset\n(or Mset-Fmla0)\nsequent calculus rules for \u00ac, which can be taken to be those given\nin Section\n 2\n with the set-variables taken as multiset-variables (suitably\nrestricted for Mset-Fmla0),\nuniquely characterize \u00ac, but\nhave no direct application in Mset-Fmla\nor any other framework with a fixed multiset\ncardinality on the right (or the left, for that matter). We can say in\nthis framework that the rules governing \u00ac uniquely characterize\nthis connective in terms of \u2192 and f\u2014on\nthe basis of which it would indeed be explicitly definable (\u00ac\n\u03c6 as \u03c6 \u2192 f), but since here f is not\nuniquely characterized (even though \u2192 is), this still leaves\n\u00ac without its (perhaps) expected uniqueness, as is even more\nevident in Fmla. These considerations continue\nto apply in the presence of contraction (and \u2227/\u2228) distribution,\naccounting for the complaint sometimes made that relevant logic does\nnot operate with a uniquely characterized negation. The point here has\nnot been either to press or to reply to such complaints, but to note\ntheir framework sensitivity: they do not arise for Mset-Mset\nor Mset-Fmla0.\n\nThe existence and uniqueness questions for connectives turn out in the\ncase of sequent calculus rules to be intimately connected with the\nstructural rules (Id) and (Cut). Let us call the left and right\ninsertion rules governing an n-ary connective #\u2014or\nderivatively, the connective thereby\ngoverned\u2014Id-inductive if the provability of\n#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n) \u227b\n#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n) follows from\nthe provability of each \u03c6i \u227b\n\u03c6i (i = 1,\u2026,n) by\nmeans of those rules (without assistance from other structural rules).\nThus means that no provable sequents are lost if the rule (Id) itself\nis restricted to having applications \u03c6 \u227b \u03c6 for \u03c6 a\npropositional variable. And let us say that the rules in question are\nCut-inductive if an application of the rule (Cut) with the\nformula #(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n) as\ncut-formula (i.e., as the \u03c6 of our representation of the rule\n(Cut) in Section\n 2\n or the analogous rule in Set-Set\nor the multiset based frameworks) can be\ndispensed with if the premiss sequents for the application of the rule\nhave been derived by (# Left) and (# Right) and (Cut) is allowed with\nthe components \u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n\nas cut-formulas (but again, not allowing the use of other structural\nrules).\n\nAll the connectives of the standard sequent calculi, including the\ncases of classical and intuitionistic linear logic, are inserted by\nrules which are both Id-inductive and Cut-inductive, as we illustrate\nhere with the rules for \u2192. For definiteness, think of these as\nthe Left and Right rules of classical linear logic. To show\nId-inductivity, we must show that \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8\n\u227b \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 is provable using the \u2192 rules,\ngiven (\u2018the inductive hypothesis\u2019) that \u03c6\n\u227b \u03c6 and \u03c8\n\u227b \u03c8 are. (We write \u03c6 and \u03c8 rather than\n\u03c61 and \u03c62.) From the last two sequents,\n(\u2192 Left) delivers: \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8, \u03c6 \u227b \u03c8. From\nthis an application of (\u2192 Right) gives the desired conclusion:\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 \u227b \u03c6 \u2192\n\u03c8.\n\nFor Cut-inductivity suppose (1) \u0393, \u0393\u2032, \u03c6 \u2192\n\u03c8 \u227b \u0394, \u0394\u2032 has arisen by (\u2192 Left) from\n(1a) \u0393 \u227b \u03c6, \u0394 and (2a) \u0393\u2032, \u03c8\n\u227b \u0394\u2032, while (2) \u0393\u2032\u2032 \u227b \u03c6\n\u2192 \u03c8, \u0394\u2032\u2032 has arisen by (\u2192 Right) from\n(2a) \u0393\u2032\u2032, \u03c6 \u227b \u03c8,\n\u0394\u2032\u2032. We need to show that a cut on (1) and (2) with\ncut-formula \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 can be avoided on the hypothesis that\nwe can help ourselves to cuts with cut-formulas \u03c6, \u03c8. From\n(1a) and (2a), cutting on \u03c6, we get (3) \u0393,\n\u0393\u2032\u2032 \u227b \u03c8, \u0394\u2032\u2032. Then\ncutting on \u03c8, (2b) and (3) deliver the desired conclusion:\n\u0393, \u0393\u2032, \u0393\u2032\u2032 \u227b \u0394,\n\u0394\u2032, \u0394\u2032\u2032, without the need to use \u03c6\n\u2192 \u03c8 as a cut-formula with (1) and (2) as premisses.\n\nCut-inductivity is one aspect of a procedure which has traditionally\nbeen a professional obsession of proof-theorists: the provision of\n\u2018Cut Elimination\u2019 theorems to the effect that this or that\nsequent calculus with the rule (Cut) can have this rule removed\nwithout the loss of any provable sequents. Obviously more is needed to\nshow this than the Cut-inductivity of the (pairs of) rules, since\nthere are also, inter alia, potential interactions with the\nother structural (and operational) rules to be taken care of. Such\nresults are of interest because much follows from the subformula\nproperty\u2014any sequent provable has a proof in which the only\nformulas to appear are subformulas of those in the sequent\nconcerned\u2014which itself follows from the result since all the\nremaining rules insert material rather than remove it in the course of\nthe\n proof.[29]\n But from the perspective of the philosophy of logic, Cut-inductivity\nand its somewhat less well-publicized companion, Id-inductivity,\nshould be considered on a par, as the following somewhat\nimpressionistic semantical remark (Girard, Taylor and Lafont 1989,\np. 31) of Girard suggests, apropos of (Cut), in which C\nrepresents the cut formula (and (Id) with C on the left and\nright of the \u201c\u227b\u201d):\n\nThe identity axiom says that C (on the left) is stronger than\nC (on the right); this rule [ = (Cut)] states the converse\ntruth, i.e. C (on the right) is stronger than C (on\nthe left).\n\n\nThe point of isolating Id- and Cut-inductivity here, however, has less\nto do with matters of truth (on which, and for further references to\nGirard on which, see further H\u00f6sli and J\u00e4ger 1994) than\nwith uniqueness and existence\u2014not that the semantical issues are\nunconnected with this, of course. The former link is perhaps already\nclear. At the last step of establishing Id-inductivity for \u2192,\nabove, we passed from \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8, \u03c6 \u227b \u03c8,\nobtained by (\u2192 Left), to \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 \u227b \u03c6 \u2192\n\u03c8, by (\u2192 Left): but this is just what the uniqueness proof in\nthe reduplicated sequent calculus would do, except that the final step\nwould be an application of (\u2192\u2032 Right) and would establish\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 \u227b \u03c6 \u2192\u2032 \u03c8, with the\nconverse proved by interchanging the rules used for \u2192 and\n\u2192\u2032.\n\nTo see the connection between existence\u2014or more specifically,\nthe conservative extension side of the existence\nquestion\u2014convert the natural deduction rules for Tonk\ngiven earlier into sequent calculus rules (here\nfor Set-Fmla):\n\n\n\n (Tonk Left) \n\n\n\n\n\u0393,\u03c8 \u227b \u03c7  \n\n \u0393, \u03c6 Tonk\n\u03c8 \u227b \u03c7  \n  \n\n\n\n (Tonk Right) \n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c6  \n\n \u0393 \u227b \u03c6 Tonk\n\u03c8  \n  \n\n\n\nBy applying the right insertion rule with premiss sequent (courtesy of\n(Id)) \u03c6 \u227b \u03c6 and the left rule with premiss \u03c8 \u227b\n\u03c8 we arrive at the point at which our natural deduction derivation\nstarted to go bad: we have:\n\n\n\n \u03c6 \u227b \u03c6 Tonk \u03c8 \n and \n \u03c6 Tonk \u03c8 \u227b \u03c8 \n\n\n\n\nand an appeal to (Cut) here, with \u03c6 Tonk\n\u03c8 as cut-formula, amounts to bringing home the bad\n news.[30]\n But of course this example simply makes vivid the fact that the Tonk\nrules in play are not Cut-inductive and there\nis no Cut-free proof of the desired sequent (at least in general: take\n\u03c6 = p, \u03c8 = q). This is hardly surprising\nsince the subformula property which Cut Elimination secures itself\nguarantees that the rules for one connective conservatively extend the\nsubsystem comprising the rules for the remaining connectives. In the\npresent case, the point of the example was that there was no proof of,\nfor example, p \u227b q which did not\ndetour\u2014in violation of the subformula property\u2014via\nformulas involving Tonk.\n\nWe can look at what is roughly speaking a mirror-image of the Tonk\nexample to reinforce the contrast between\nCut-inductivity and Id-inductivity and their respective links with\nexistence and uniqueness, and then sort out the \u201croughly\nspeaking\u201d part of this description, which will show them as\nproviding, rather, special\u2014one might say canonical\u2014cases\nof the satisfaction of the existence ( = conservative extension) and\nuniqueness conditions. We conduct the discussion in Set-Set\nrather than Set-Fmla\nto avoid a mass of\ncomplications. The above Tonk rules combine a\nleft insertion rule familiar from the sequent calculus treatment of\n\u2227 and a right insertion rule familiar from that of \u2228; their\nreformulation for the change of framework just announced requires an\nidle \u0394 parameter on the right of the sequents in the premisses\nand conclusions of the rules as schematically presented above\n(replacing the \u03c7 in the one case, accompanying the displayed\nsuccedent formulas in the other). For our mirror image\n example,[31]\n consider a binary connective Knot with rules\ncombining instead the left insertion rule for \u2228 with the right\ninsertion rule for \u2227:\n\n\n\n (Knot Left) \n\n\n\n\n\u0393,\u03c6 \u227b \u0394\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0393,\u03c8\n\u227b \u0394  \n\n \u0393, \u03c6 Knot\n\u03c8 \u227b \u0394  \n  \n\n\n\n (Knot Right) \n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c6, \u0394\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0393\n\u227b \u03c8, \u0394  \n\n \u0393 \u227b \u03c6 Knot\n\u03c8, \u0394  \n  \n\n\n\nThese rules are Cut-inductive, as the interested reader may confirm,\nbut not Id-inductive, since they do not uniquely characterize Knot.\nTo see this, note that both are derivable\nrules for \u2227 and also for \u2228, and of course we cannot prove \u03c6\n\u2228 \u03c8 \u227b \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 in general. By contrast, neither\n\u2227 nor \u2228 satisfies both of the left and right rules for\nTonk. The upshot of the Knot\nrules is best visualised in terms of the\nzero-premiss rules (sequent-schemata) with which they are\ninterderivable given the structural rules: \u03c6,\n\u03c8 \u227b \u03c6 Knot \u03c8 (the\nright rule) and \u03c6 Knot\n\u03c8 \u227b \u03c6, \u03c8 (the left rule). An incidental\npoint: since these are the sequent formulations of conditions induced\nby the determinants \u27e8T, T, T\u27e9 and\n\u27e8F, F, F\u27e9 one might think of them\ntogether as expressing idempotence and therefore as being\ninterchangeable with the simpler pair \u03c6 \u227b \u03c6 Knot\n\u03c6 and \u03c6 Knot\n\u03c6 \u227b \u03c6. But while the latter two can be derived from the\nearlier pair (just take \u03c8 as \u03c6), the converse derivation is\nnot possible without further principles\u2014conspicuously, a sequent\nversion of the extensionality conditions on generalized consequence\nrelations mentioned in Section\n 2.\n We could call binary # for which \u03c6, \u03c8 \u22a9\u03c6 # \u03c8\nand conversely, strongly idempotent according to the\ngeneralized consequence relation \u22a9. Then \u2227 and \u2228 are not\nthe only Boolean candidates for a connective behaving as the Knot\nrules dictate\u2014strongly idempotent\naccording to the generalized consequence relation\n\u22a9CL determined by the class of Boolean\nvaluations: we also have the binary projection to the first coordinate\n(\u03c6 # \u03c8 equivalent to \u03c6), to the second coordinate (\u03c6 #\n\u03c8 equivalent to \u03c8), and venturing further afield, the Set-Fmla\nhybrids of any two\nof these connectives. Of these perhaps the most interesting is the\nhybrid of the two projection connectives, since this\u2014let us\nwrite is as \u201c\u2022\u201d\u2014can be used to define all other\nhybrids explicitly from the connectives to be hybridized; for example\nif we want the common properties (as explained in Section\n 2)\n of \u2192 and \u2228, we have them in the following compound of \u03c6\nand \u03c8: (\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8) \u2022 (\u03c6 \u2228\n \u03c8).[32]\n\nIf the treatment of Knot were genuinely the\nmirror image of that of Tonk, we would be able\nto say that just as the Knot rules are\nCut-inductive but not Id-inductive, so the Tonk\nrules are Id-inductive but not Cut-inductive.\n(The twofold demand of Cut- and Id-inductivity is a promising\ncandidate for the notion of harmony as it applies to the\nrelation between right and left insertion rules in a sequent\n calculus.[33])\n And while the failure of Cut-inductivity was indeed noted, nothing\nwas said on the subject of Id-inductivity for these rules. Spoiling\nthe intended duality, the situation is that the Tonk\nrules fail on this score too\u2014though this\ncan be remedied by a simple variation. First, we should note that\nPrior\u2019s point could equally well have been made by combining the\n\u2228 introduction rule from the second (rather than the to\nfirst) disjunct with the \u2227 elimination rule to the first\n(rather than to the second) conjunct. Call the connective with these\nrules Tonk*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tonk* Left \n\n\n\n\n\u0393,\u03c8 \u227b \u0394  \n\n \u0393, \u03c6 Tonk*\n\u03c8 \u227b \u0394  \n  \n \n\n\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tonk*\nRight \n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c8, \u0394  \n\n \u0393 \u227b \u03c6 Tonk*\n\u03c8, \u0394  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThis suffers from the same defects in respect of the analogy with\nKnot, so, finally, let Tonk+\nbe governed by the rules for Tonk\nand also the rules for Tonk*.\nIt is Tonk+\nthat has Knot\nas its mirror image, since just as we Knot\nhas the full force of the (\u2227 Right) and\n(\u2228 Left) rules, Tonk+ enjoys the\nfull force of the (\u2227 Left) and (\u2228 Right) rules. (So here we\narrive at the reason that Knot was originally\ndescribed as only roughly speaking a mirror image of Tonk.)\nAnd this time the rules are indeed\nId-inductive without being Cut-inductive. Indeed, Id-inductivity is\nsecured by two independent routes: by the interaction of the Tonk\nLeft rule for Tonk+\nwith the Tonk*\nRight rule to Tonk+,\nand then again by the interaction\nof Tonk+\u2018s Tonk*\nLeft rule with its Tonk\nRight rule. (To give the former in more detail,\nby way of example, the Tonk Left rule for\nTonk+ gives \u03c6 Tonk+\n\u03c8 \u227b\u03c8 from\n(Id)-for-\u03c8, from which applying the Tonk*\nRight rule for Tonk+ we obtain\n\u03c6 Tonk+ \u03c8 \u227b \u03c6\nTonk+ \u03c8.)\n\nLet us sum up the lessons for the relations between existence and\nCut-inductivity and between uniqueness and Id-inductivity that can be\nextracted from the foregoing discussion. Sequent calculus rules which\nare Id-inductive uniquely characterize the connective they govern, but\nnot necessarily conversely: the Tonk rules are\nnot Id-inductive, but they do uniquely characterize Tonk,\nsince they are already so strong that any\nsequent with at least one formula on the left and at least one on the\nright can be proved with their aid, and hence, in the reduplicated\nsystem with Tonk\u2032, we can certainly\nprove \u03c6 Tonk \u03c8 \u227b \u03c6 Tonk\u2032\n\u03c8 and the converse\nsequent\u2014without even using the Tonk\u2032\nrules! (This is the kind of thing we\nhave in mind in calling this a non-canonical form of uniqueness.) On\nthe \u2018existence\u2019 side: it is not clear to the author\nwhether any Cut-inductive rules governing a connective guarantee that\nthey are conservative over the (system consisting of the) rules\ngoverning other connective\u2014since Cut Elimination may fail for\nother reasons; nor do the examples just considered settle the\nconverse, as we see from the following tabular summary of our\nfindings, in which (a \u201cYes\u201d by) \u201cunique\u201d means\nthe rules uniquely characterize the connective, and\n\u201cconservative\u201d means that we have a conservative extension\nof any system of sequent-calculus rules not involving the given\nconnective; Tonk* is not listed separately\nsince it patterns the same way as Tonk:\n\n\n\nId-inductive\nUnique\nCut-inductive\nConservative \n\nTonk\nNo\nYes\nNo\nNo \n\nTonk+\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo \n\nKnot\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes \n\n\nThat is enough on the subject of Tonk and\nvariations. We will make one point about unique characterization and\nthen give some examples of non-conservative extension which will\ninvolve introducing the important concepts of special and\nuniversally representative connectives. Some further\n\u2018existence\u2019 examples are deferred to the following\nsection.\n\nThe above discussion has included such phrases as \u201cthe hybrid of\n\u2227 and \u2228\u201d; the totality of principles governing such a\nconnective being those common to \u2227 and \u2228, we obviously do not\nhave a connective uniquely characterized by those principles\u2014in\nwhich case is it legitimate to speak of the hybrid\u2026? I\ntake this way of speaking to be as harmless as speaking of \u201cthe\n\u2610 operator of S5\u201d, where again the logical\nprinciples involved are insufficient to characterize the connective\nuniquely\u2014in terms of the Boolean connectives or\notherwise\u2014at least if we are Fmla, Set-Fmla\nor Set-Set,\nand in the latter\ncases, working with the so-called local (generalized)\nconsequence\n relation.[34]\n (See Section\n 5\n for the distinction between the local and the global consequence\nrelations determined by a class of models.) One could say that in the\nmonomodal, unreduplicated case, we have a single connective playing a\ncertain role and we can refer to it in that context as the\nconnective playing the role in question, while conceding, as we learn\nfrom the reduplicated case, that this is a role that can be played\nsimultaneously (i.e. in a single logic) by several non-equivalent\nconnectives. This is the kind of situation \u0141ukasiewicz had in\nmind when, in his (1953), he likened certain pairs of connectives to\n\u201ctwins who cannot be distinguished when met separately, but are\ninstantly recognised as two when seen together\u201d.\n\nWe saw earlier that combining the intuitionistic and classical rules\nin a single proof system did not work well, and another suggestion\nthat comes to mind is that we could perhaps extend intuitionistic\nlogic with a new connective, 1-ary #, say, which does what according\nto the intuitionist, negation (\u00ac) itself cannot do: serve as a\nleft inverse for \u00ac in the sense of rendering equivalent\n#\u00ac\u03c6 and \u03c6 for all\n \u03c6.[35]\n This again represents an offer the intuitionist cannot afford to\naccept, assuming that any (the rules for any) proposed new connectives\nshould conserve synonymy, as suggested above. (The even stronger\ndemand that the consequence relation associated with the extended\nproof systems should be congruential does not seem unreasonable.) The\nreason is that \u00acp and \u00ac\u00ac\u00acp are\nintuitionistically equivalent (and thus synonymous according to\n\u22a2I\u2009L) so the conservation of synonymy\nrequires that #\u00acp and #\u00ac\u00ac\u00acp should\nbe equivalent\u2014since we have this \u2018Law of Triple\nNegation\u2019 equivalence in intuitionistic logic\u2014from which\nthe left inverse condition above delivers, taking \u03c6 as\n\u00acp in the former case and as \u00ac\u00ac\u00acp in\nthe latter, the equivalence of p with\n\u00ac\u00acp\u2014a straightforwardly non-conservative\nextension, then. (A similar argument shows that adding binary # with\n\u03c6 # (\u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8) equivalent to \u03c8\u2014a possibility\nsuggesting itself since, by contrast with the classical case, \u2194\nitself cannot serve as # here\u2014is also non-conservative.) Nor,\nincidentally, could the intuitionist acknowledge the existence of a\nright inverse for negation, a # with arbitrary \u03c6\nequivalent to \u00ac # \u03c6, as this makes every formula equivalent to\na negated formula and hence to its own double negation. This argument,\nwhich is well known (see, e.g., Koslow (1992), p. 97), does not even\nrequire the \u2018conservation of synonymies\u2019 constraint.\n\nThese last non-existence proofs force our attention on the fact that\nnegated formulas are \u2018special\u2019 in intuitionistic logic in\nthat each such formula is equivalent to its own double negation while\nthis is not so for arbitrary formulas. Let us back up and give a clear\nexplanation of the notion of specialness as well as a contrasting\nnotion, in slightly more general terms; for definiteness only, we\ntailor the account to Set-Fmla.\nWe also begin with the contrasting notion. Say\nthat an n-ary relation R among the formulas of a\nlanguage is universally representative according to a\nconsequence relation on that language if for any formulas\n\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n of the language,\nthere are formulas\n\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n, respectively\nsynonymous with \u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n\naccording to \u22a2, with\nR(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n). (If\nn = 1, we speak instead of a universally representative\nclass of formulas\u2014a class of formulas such that every\nformula is synonymous with some formula in the class; likewise in the\ncase of the notion special, defined below.) If \u22a2 is\ncongruential then we can replace \u201csynonymous\u201d in this\ndefinition with \u201cequivalent\u201d (i.e. such that\n\u03c6i \u22a3\u22a2 \u03c8i,\nfor i = 1,\u2026,n). Say that R is\nspecial according to \u22a2 if there is some Set-Fmla\nsequent \u03c3(p1,\u2026,\npn) constructed using not\nnecessarily just the variables exhibited, for which for any formulas\n\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n with\nR(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n), we\nhave \u03c3(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n)\n\u2208 \u22a2, while we do not have, for all formulas\n\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n, \u03c3(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n)\n\u2208 \u22a2. For substitution-invariant \u22a2, this last\ncondition can be simplified to:\n\u03c3(p1,\u2026,\npn) \u2209\n \u22a2.[36]\n A consequence of these definitions is that no relation is both\nuniversally representative and special according to any given \u22a2.\nA simple example of a special relation\u2014according to more or less\nany \u2018naturally occurring\u2019 consequence relation with \u2228\nin its language is relation R obtaining between \u03c6 and\n\u03c8 just in case \u03c8 is a disjunction of which \u03c6 is a\ndisjunct. Here take \u03c3(p, q) as p\n\u227b q which is (e.g., in intuitionistic logic, though\nclassical logic or any of many others would do as well)\nunprovable\u2014i.e., not p\n\u22a2I\u2009L q\u2014while \u03c6\n\u22a2I\u2009L \u03c8 for all \u03c6, \u03c8 for\nwhich R(\u03c6, \u03c8). A more interesting example is the\nrelation of being (intuitionistically) head-linked, i.e.,\nthat relation R such that for all \u03c6, \u03c8,\nR(\u03c6, \u03c8) if and only if:\n\nfor some formulas \u03c7, \u03c60, \u03c80, we have\n\u03c6 \u22a3\u22a2I\u2009L \u03c60\n\u2192 \u03c7 and \u03c8\n\u22a3\u22a2I\u2009L \u03c80 \u2192\n\u03c7.\n\n\nThe analogous relation for classical logic would be universally\nrepresentative (and thus not special), at least in any fragment which,\nas well as having \u2192, has either \u22a5 or \u2227, since any \u03c6\nand \u03c8 are here respectively equivalent to (\u03c6 \u2192 \u22a5)\n\u2192 \u22a5 and (\u03c8 \u2192 \u22a5) \u2192 \u22a5, where they are\nlinked explicitly by having a common \u03c7 at the head of the main\nimplication. (Alternatively with \u2227, replace \u22a5 here by \u03c6\n\u2227 \u03c8.) But in the intuitionistic case the relation of being\nhead-linked is special since, for example, with Peirce\u2019s law\n\u03c3(p,q) = (p \u2192 q) \u2192\np \u227b p, we have \u03c3(p, q)\nintuitionistically unprovable but we have \u03c3(\u03c6,\u03c8) \u2208\n\u22a2I\u2009L for any head-linked \n\u03c6, \u03c8.\n\nConcentrating now on 1-ary relations between\u2014i.e., classes\nof\u2014formulas, we transfer the above terminology to connectives by\nsaying that a connective is universally representative or\nspecial according to a consequence relation if the class of\nformulas with the given connective as main connective is itself a\nuniversally representative class or a special class of formulas,\nrespectively, according to the consequence relation in question. While\nevery non-constant\n connective[37]\n is universally representative according to\n\u22a2CL our discussion of inverses for\nintuitionistic \u00ac shows that \u00ac is special according to \u22a2,\nsince we can take \u03c3(p) as \u00ac\u00acp \u227b\np and every substitution instance of this IL-unprovable\nsequent in which p is replaced by a negated formula is\nIL-provable. Negation is therefore not universally representative in\nintuitionistic logic. (This means that we could usefully speak, from\nthe perspective of \u22a2I\u2009L, of negative\npropositions, thinking of the equivalence class, with respect\nto the relation of synonymy, of a formula as the proposition thereby\nexpressed, and meaning by this the equivalence classes of negated\nformulas. Classically, the corresponding notion is not useful since\nall propositions would count as negative, just as for both\n\u22a2CL and \u22a2I\u2009L,\nthere are no specifically conjunctive or disjunctive\npropositions.)\n\nAlthough the properties of being special and being universally\nrepresentative according to a given logic are mutually exclusive, they\nare not jointly exhaustive. For example, \u22a5 is neither universally\nrepresentative nor special in minimal logic (according to the\nconsequence relation associated with the Johansson\u2019s\nMinimalkalk\u00fcl, that is). Nor does the connective \u2610\nhave either of these properties in the modal logic KD\n(sometimes just called D), though this example is far from\nselected at random: in the sublogic K, \u2610 is special (since\n\u2610\u22a5 \u2192 \u03c6 is provable for all \u2610-formulas \u03c6,\nthough not for arbitrary \u03c6), and in the extension KD4 it is\nspecial again (since \u03c6 \u2192 \u2610\u03c6 is provable for all\n\u2610-formulas \u03c6, though not for all formulas).\n",
