    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nEdwards was born into a family of prominent Congregational ministers\nin East Windsor, Connecticut in 1703. In 1716 Edwards enrolled in Yale\nwhere he read Newton and Locke, and began \u201cNotes on the\nMind\u201d and \u201cNotes on Natural Science.\u201d Locke's\ninfluence on his epistemology, philosophy of language, and\nphilosophical psychology was profound. Edwards' metaphysics, however,\nappears more strongly influenced by Malebranche and, to a lesser\nextent, the Cambridge Platonists, and bears little resemblance to\nLocke's. After briefly serving congregations in New York and Bolton,\nConnecticut, Edwards returned to Yale where he completed his Masters\nof Arts degree and became senior tutor in 1724. In 1725, the church in\nNorthampton chose Edwards to succeed his grandfather, Solomon Stoddard\n\u2014 the so-called \u201cpope of the Connecticut valley.\u201d\nThe most notable events of his tenure were the revivals of 1734 and\n1740\u201341, the latter of which came to be known as the Great\nAwakening. Edwards' defense of the revivals and criticisms of its\nexcesses culminated in his first major treatise, the\nReligious Affections (1746). Worsening relations\nwith his congregation came to a head in a dispute over qualifications\nfor church membership. Rejecting the less rigorous standards of his\ngrandfather, Edwards insisted on a public profession of saving faith\nbased on the candidate's religious experiences as a qualification not\nonly for Holy Communion but also for church membership. He was\ndismissed in 1750 by a margin of one vote. After refusing invitations\nto pulpits in North America and Scotland, Edwards retreated to the\nIndian mission at Stockbridge where he had charge of two difficult\ncongregations, supervised a boarding school for Indian boys, and\ncompleted his last major works \u2014 Freedom of the Will\n(1754), Original Sin (1758), End of Creation, and\nTrue Virtue (both published posthumously in 1765). Edwards\naccepted an appointment as President of the College of New Jersey (now\nPrinceton) in 1757. He died from complications arising from a smallpox\ninoculation on March 22, 1758, less than five weeks after his\ninauguration. Edwards' published works were primarily designed to\ndefend the Puritan version of Calvinist orthodoxy and his influence on\nCongregational and Presbyterian theology was profound. His extensive\nnotebooks reveal an interest in philosophical problems for their own\nsake, however, and his deployment of philosophical arguments in his\nprivate papers and published works are both sophisticated and\nfrequently original.\n",
