Most people,\nincluding myself, upon hearing:\n\nShe bought a rabbit.\n\n\nwill think that it\u2019s safe to infer that she bought a\nfuzzy little pet that hops around and likes carrots. However, upon\nlearning that there is a car by the same name made by Volkswagen, it\nwill be much less clear to me that I know what she bought.\n\nSimilar phenomena include dead metaphors and idioms. The former\ninclude such items as \u2018branch\u2019 which now applies to\ndistinct sections of the government, the latter to phrases \u2018kick\nthe bucket.\u2019 (As an aside, I puzzled over several candidates for\nboth and realized it was hard to tell in most cases which were which!)\nThese clearly pass the ambiguity tests above by exhibiting zeugma,\ni.e.,\n\n?The government and the trees have branches.\n?He kicked the bucket last week and she did too, twice.\n\n\nIt\u2019s controversial whether metaphors ever actually die and\nwhether or not, assuming they do die, they are metaphors. So it is\ncontroversial whether or not \u2018branch\u2019 is lexically\nambiguous. It clearly has two readings but whether or not these are to\nbe reflected as lexical meanings is a difficult and vague\nmatter \u2013 not that it clearly matters all that much in most\ncases.\n",
