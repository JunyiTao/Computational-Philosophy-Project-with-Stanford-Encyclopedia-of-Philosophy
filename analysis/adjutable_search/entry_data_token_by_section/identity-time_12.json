What is it for a person existing at one time to be\nidentical to a person existing at another? This question was first\nclearly posed by John Locke in his celebrated discussion of personal\nidentity in the Essay (Locke 1975). Locke distinguishes\nbetween being the same man and being the same person. To be the same\nman is to be the same member of the species human being. For Locke\nwhat is crucial is that having the same consciousness is not\nsufficient for being the same man, but is sufficient for being the\nsame person.\n\nFamously Locke calls the concept of a person a forensic concept. For\nLocke much of the importance attaching to being the same person is\nthat moral responsibility for past deeds goes with being the same\nperson, rather than being the same man or even the same immaterial\nsubstance, as a past person. In his view it is enough to be morally\nresponsible for some deed that one is the same person as its\nperformer. It is not required that one be the same man or the same\nimmaterial substance as the one who performed the act in question.\n\nWhat then, according to Locke, is it to have the same consciousness as\nsome past person? He is customarily interpreted as holding that person\nA is the same person as earlier person B just in\ncase A is able to remember enough of what happened to\nB. This is sometimes referred to as the memory criterion of\npersonal identity. The memory criterion was criticized by Butler and\nReid principally because it was said to be circular, and, as a\ncriterion of personal identity, incompatible with the transitivity of\nidentity. (See Section 2.2, and Joseph Butler \u2018Of Personal\nIdentity\u2019 and Thomas Reid \u2018Of Mr. Locke's Account of Our\nPersonal Identity\u2019 in Perry 1975.)\n\nThe argument for the circularity of the memory criterion went like\nthis. Suppose we think of the memory criterion as giving what would be\nlater called an analysis of A being the same person as\nB. If so, we are invited to analyze A being the same\nperson as b in terms of A remembering enough of what\nhappened to B. But any plausible analysis of A\nremembering what happened to B will mention, in the\nanalysans, A being the same person as B.\n\nSydney Shoemaker has responded to the circularity charge by\ndistinguishing remembering from what he calls Q-remembering (Shoemaker\n1975). A Q-remembers something that happened to b\njust in case there is an appropriate causal link between the event\nQ-remembered and A's memory impression of that event. Unlike\nremembering, Q-remembering a past experience does not imply the\nidentity of the one having the Q-memory with the one who had the\nexperience. We can avoid the charge of circularity by restating the\nmemory criterion in the following way. A is the same person\nas some earlier individual B if and only if A\nQ-remembers enough of what happened to B.\n\nThe charge that the memory criterion conflicts with the transitivity\nof identity was illustrated by the famous case of the schoolboy, the\nyoung lieutenant and the elderly general (Reid 1975). The elderly\ngeneral can Q-remember enough of what happened to the young lieutenant\nto qualify, by the memory criterion, as being the same person as the\nyoung lieutenant. The young lieutenant in turn Q-remembers enough of\nwhat happened to the young schoolboy. But the elderly general can\nremember almost nothing of what happened to the young schoolboy. Since\nthe memory criterion has it that A Q-remembering enough of\nwhat happened to B is a necessary condition for A\nbeing the same person as an earlier person B, it follows\nthat, according to the memory criterion, the elderly general is not\nthe same person as the young schoolboy. Hence, the memory criterion\nimplies, contrary to the transitivity of identity, that, although the\nelderly general is the same person as the young lieutenant, and the\nyoung lieutenant is the same person as the schoolboy, the elderly\ngeneral is not the same person as the young schoolboy.\n\nThe memory criterion came to be modified in two further ways. The\nfirst modification provides a way of reconciling the memory criterion\nwith the transitivity of identity in the light of cases such as the\nelderly general. Instead of saying that A is the same person\nas some earlier B if and only if A can Q-remember\nenough of what happened to B, we say the following.\nA is the same person as B if and only if there is a\nQ-memory chain linking A with B. For there to be a\nQ-memory link between A and B, either A\nremembers enough of what happened to B, or A\nremembers enough of what happened to someone who remembers enough of\nwhat happened to B, or A remembers enough of what\nhappened to someone who remembers enough of what happened to someone\nwho remembers enough of what happened to B, and so on. In the\ncase of the elderly general, the elderly general does remember enough\nof what happened to, someone, the young lieutenant, who remembers\nenough of what happened to the young schoolboy to count, by the\nmodified criterion, as the same person as the young schoolboy.\n\nThe second modification extends the memory criterion to include\nforward looking psychological connections, such as that between\npresent intention and future action, as determinants of personal\nidentity.\n\nWith these modifications incorporated the memory criterion has come to\nbe known as the psychological continuity criterion of personal\nidentity. The psychological continuity criterion is an improvement on\nthe original memory criterion. Nevertheless one of the problems\nconfronting the original memory criterion, its putative conflict with\nthe transitivity of identity, can be brought against its successor in\na different form. We saw that making certain identifications in a\nfission case such as the ship of Theseus [see Section 4: Diachronic\nIdentity Puzzles] threatens the transitivity of identity. One much\ndiscussed type of fission case, hemispheric division, is taken by many\nto show that the psychological continuity criterion is, after all,\nincompatible with the transitivity of identity (Nagel 1975).\n\nSuppose, as may one day be medically feasible, an individual\nA's still functioning upper brain is transplanted from\nA's body to the debrained, but living, body formerly\nbelonging to B. Upon being transplanted A's upper brain is\nconnected to what remains of B's central nervous system so\nthat a person, call her A-B, results.\nA-B believes herself to be A, can\nQ-remember what happened to A, has A's psychological\ndispositions, and so on. Should we say that A-B is\nthe same person as A, the same person as B, or an\naltogether new person? Psychological continuity theorists will have\nlittle hesitation in answering that A-B is the same\nperson as A.\n\nA person can function fairly normally with much of their brain\ndestroyed. Suppose A loses an entire brain hemisphere. Given\nthe plasticity of the brain, and aided by our hypothetical future\nmedical technology, it may be that A could survive such a\nloss. If so, it would be unreasonable to deny that A could\nsurvive the transplantation of only one brain hemisphere given that\nshe could survive the transplantation of he entire intact upper\nbrain.\n\nThe putative conflict with transitivity arises when we consider a case\nin which both of the separated hemispheres of A's original\nbrain are transplanted to separate bodies resulting in what certainly\nlook to be distinct individuals. Suppose, one of A's brain\nhemispheres is transferred to B's body, resulting in a person\nPB, and the other to C's body resulting in a person\nPC. It flouts transitivity to say that PC is\nidentical with A, and that A is identical with\nPB, but deny, at it seems we should, that PC is\nidentical with PB.\n\nThere are a number of ways that defenders of a psychological\ncontinuity criterion have attempted to evade this result. One, adopted\nby David Lewis, goes like this (Lewis 1976). We say that earlier, when\nA is around with an intact brain, there are two indiscernible\nindividuals, PB and PC, sharing a single body.\nAnother, advocated by Robert Nozick, concedes that if both hemispheres\nare successfully transplanted, neither of the later individuals with\njust one brain hemisphere is identical with the earlier one with an\nintact brain, but insist that if only one hemisphere is transplanted,\nthe resulting individual is identical with the former possessor of two\nhemispheres. On this view whether, for example, PB is\nidentical with the earlier person with A's body depends on\nwhether there is an equally good later candidate, such as PC,\nfor being the earlier A-body person (Nozick 1981).\n\nIn one of the most influential discussions of personal identity Derek\nParfit defends a view close to Nozick's by distinguishing between\nsurvival and identity (in Perry 1975). In Nozick's view what\npsychological continuity guarantees is not identity, but survival. In\nthe case where both of A's hemispheres are transplanted to\nyield PB and PC, A survives as PB,\nand survives as PC, though she is identical with neither\nPB nor PC.\n\nParfit, Nozick and Lewis all take psychological continuity to be\nintegral to personal identity in the following sense. In cases where\nthere is no branching psychological continuity is sufficient to ensure\nthe identity of a later with an earlier person. A number of\nphilosophers would reject this claim insisting that bodily persistence\nis required for personal identity. Some, for example Eric Olson, would\nargue that psychological continuity is irrelevant to the identity of\nthose things, human beings, who are the only things we know to be\npersons. Instead, on this view, what is crucial to personal identity\nfor humans is continuing to be the same animal (Olson 1997).\n",
