It is widely accepted that meaning is in some sense\ncompositional, but there are many non-equivalent ways to elaborate\nwhat precisely this amounts to. One hypothesis which originates in the\nwork of Richard Montague but has been substantially developed by\nPauline Jacobson (and others), is the idea of  direct\n compositionality[31]:\n \u201cthe hypothesis that the syntax and the semantics work \n\u2018in tandem\u2019. The syntax builds expressions and the\nsemantics works to assign meanings to the representations as they are\nbuilt in the syntax\u201d (Jacobson 2012, 109). As Jacobson argues,\nthe hypothesis of direct compositionality is attractive for a number\nof reasons: it is theoretically parsimonious, unifying the\ncompositional theories of syntax and semantics, and it explains why\nsemantic composition seem to proceed in a local fashion: the\nmeaning of each sub-sentential expression is computed using only the\nmeanings of its syntactic constituents rather than using material in\nother parts of the sentence. But as Jacobson remarks, \u201cDirect\nCompositionality entails that there are no syntactic expressions of\nany sort, which do not have a meaning\u201d (Jacobson 2012,\n110). Note that this entails that the direct compositionality\nhypothesis is inconsistent with the meaninglessness view of category\nmistakes and thus the question of how to account for the infelicity of\ncategory mistakes interacts with the question of which formulation of\nthe principle of compositionality ought to be adopted.\n\n\nOther accounts of category mistakes have implications for different\nfoundational issues. For example, we have seen that the\ntruthvaluelessness view is committed to the existence of\ntruth-valueless propositions, which in turn conflicts with the\nTarskian truth-schema. For another example, consider the\npresuppositional account of category mistakes (on any of its\nversions). If the presuppositional account is correct, then the set\nof presupposition triggers is much wider than has previously been\nassumed: presupposition triggers are not restricted to a small number\nof special words like \u2018know\u2019 or \u2018the\u2019, but\nrather encompass at least most adverbs and adjectives in natural\nlanguage. This in turn has a variety of implications for\nthe triggering problem: the question of why particular\nlexical items trigger their respective presuppositions, and the issue\nof whether this question can be answered based on general pragmatic\nprinciples, or rather by maintaining that presupposition triggers are\n simply a conventionally encoded aspect of\n language.[32]\n\n\nOne\u2019s account of category mistakes also has implications for\nmore specific questions in the philosophy of language. We have seen\n(\u00a73.2.1) that the meaninglessness view of category mistakes is\narguably incompatible with a range of accounts for the semantics of\nmetaphor. This means that one should either reject the meaninglessness\nview, or else offer a theory of metaphor that is compatible with the\nview. Another area where the debate on category mistakes is important\nis the semantics of fictional discourse. Consider a sentence such as\n\u2018A famous detective lives in 221b Baker Street\u2019. There is\na sense in which the sentence seems true (contrast it with \u2018The\nfamous detective was called \u2018Watson\u2019\u2019 which seems\nfalse). However, the sentence isn\u2019t true on its most\nstraightforward literal reading. One popular view on how a true\nreading of such sentences can be generated (see, e.g., Lewis 1978), is\nto assume that the fictional sentence is within the scope of an\n(unpronounced) operator, so the sentence is taken to express a claim\nof the form: \u2018According to the Sherlock Homes stories, a famous\ndetective lives in 221b Baker Street\u2019, a claim which is\nstraightforwardly true. Recall, however that fictions can often\ncontain categorically mistaken sentences; for example, \u201cOnce\nthere was a tree and she loved a little boy\u201d (Silverstein\n1964).  But if the fictional sentence \\(s\\) is either meaningless or\neven contentless, then arguably, even after embedding it in the\npropositional operator \u2018according to the story\u2019, we will\nget a contentless ascription (cf. Friend 2007, 143). The upshot is\nthat the operator view of fictional discourse is incompatible with\nboth the meaninglessness view and the contentlessness view of category\nmistakes.\n\n\nEven if one accepts that category mistakes are contentful, uses of\ncategory mistakes in fiction have significant implications for the\nphilosophy of language. For example, Nolan (2015) argues that\nfictions involving personified abstract entities (e.g., fiction in\nwhich Death is a character) entail that fictions routinely feature\nsubstantive impossible contents. This observation is important because\nit presents a challenge for accounts of contents which take them to be\nas coarse grained as possible worlds, as on such accounts there is\n only one impossible\n proposition.[33]\n",
