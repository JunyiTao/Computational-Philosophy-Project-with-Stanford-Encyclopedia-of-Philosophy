    "main_text": "The Problem of Idealization || Applications Empowered by Idealization\n7. Closing: The Expanding Territory of Bayesianism\n\nBayesian epistemology, despite the problems presented above, has been\nexpanding its scope of application. In addition to the more standard,\nolder areas of application listed in\n section 1.3,\n the newer ones can be found in the entry on\n epistemic self-doubt,\n sections 5.1 and 5.4 of the entry on\n disagreement,\n Adler (2006 [2017]: sec. 6.3), and sections 3.6 and 4 of the entry on\n social epistemology.\n\nIn their more recent works, Bayesians have also started to contribute\nto some epistemological issues that have traditionally been among the\nmost central concerns for many non-Bayesians, especially for those\nimmersed in the epistemology of all-or-nothing beliefs. I wish to\nclose by giving four groups of examples.\n\n Skeptical Challenges: Central to traditional\nepistemology is the issue of how to address certain skeptical\nchallenges. The Cartesian skeptic thinks that we are not justified in\nbelieving that we are not a brain in a vat. Huemer (2016) and Shogenji\n(2018) have each developed a Bayesian argument against this variety of\nskepticism. There is also the Pyrrhonian skeptic, who holds the view\nthat no belief can be justified due to the regress problem of\njustification: once a belief is justified with a reason, that reason\nis in need of justification, too, which kickstarts a regress. An\nattempt to reply to this skeptic quickly leads to a difficult choice\namong three positions: first, foundationalism (roughly, that the\nregress can be stopped); second, coherentism (roughly, that it is\npermissible for the regress of justifications to be circular); and\nthird, infinitism (roughly, that it is permissible for the regress of\njustifications to extend ad infinitum). To that issue\nBayesians have made some contributions. For example, White (2006)\ndevelops a Bayesian argument against an influential version of\nfoundationalism, followed by a reply from Weatherson (2007); for more,\nsee\n section 3.2 of the entry on formal epistemology.\n Klein & Warfield (1994) develop a probabilistic argument against\ncoherentism, which initiates a debate joined by many Bayesians; for\nmore, see\n section 7 of the entry on coherentist theories of epistemic justification.\n Peijnenburg (2007) defends infinitism by developing a Bayesian\nversion of it. For more on the Cartesian and Pyrrhonian skeptical\nviews, see the entry on\n skepticism.\n Theories of Knowledge and Justified Beliefs:\nWhile traditional epistemologists praise knowledge and have\nextensively studied what turns a belief into knowledge, Moss (2013,\n2018) develops a Bayesian counterpart: she argues that a credence can\nalso be knowledge-like, a property that can be studied by Bayesians.\nTraditional epistemology also features a number of competing accounts\nof justified belief, and the possibilities of their Bayesian\ncounterparts have been explored by Dunn (2015) and Tang (2016). For\nmore on the prospects of such Bayesian counterparts, see H\u00e1jek\nand Lin (2017).\n The Scientific Realism/Anti-Realism Debate:\nOne of the most classic debates in philosophy of science is that\nbetween scientific realism and anti-realism. The scientific realist\ncontends that science pursues theories are true literally or at least\napproximately, while the anti-realist denies that. An early\ncontribution to this debate is van Fraassen\u2019s (1989: part II)\nBayesian argument against inference to the best explanation (IBE),\nwhich is often used by scientific realists to defend their view. Some\nBayesians have joined the debate and try to save IBE instead; see\nsections 3.1 and 4 of the entry on\n abduction.\n Another influential defense of scientific realism proceeds with the\nso-called no-miracle argument. (This argument runs roughly as\nfollows: scientific realism is correct because it is the only\nphilosophical view that does not render the success of science a\nmiracle.) Howson (2000: ch. 3) and Magnus & Callender (2004)\nmaintain that the no-miracle argument commits a fallacy that can be\nmade salient from a Bayesian perspective. In reply, Sprenger &\nHartmann (2019: ch. 5) contend that Bayesian epistemology makes\npossible a better version of the no-miracle argument for scientific\nrealism. An anti-realist view is instrumentalism, which says that\nscience only need to pursue theories that are useful for making\nobservable predictions. Vassend (forthcoming) argues that\nconditionalization can be generalized in a way that caters to both the\nscientific realist and the instrumentalist\u2014regardless of whether\nevidence should be utilized in science to help us pursue truth or\nusefulness.\n Frequentist Concerns: Frequentists about\nstatistical inference design inference procedures for the purposes of,\nsay, testing a working hypothesis, identifying the truth among a set\nof competing hypotheses, or producing accurate estimates of certain\nquantities. And they want to design procedures that infer\nreliably\u2014with a low objective, physical chance of\nmaking errors. Those concerns have been incorporated into Bayesian\nstatistics, leading to the Bayesian counterparts of some frequentist\naccounts. In fact, those results have already appeared in standard\ntextbooks on Bayesian statistics, such as the influential one by\nGelman et al. (2014: sec. 4.4 and ch. 6). The line between frequentist\nand Bayesian statistics is blurring.\n\n\nSo, as can be seen from the many examples in I\u2013IV, Bayesians\nhave been assimilating ideas and concerns from the epistemological\ntradition of all-or-nothing beliefs. In fact, there have also been\nattempts to develop a joint epistemology\u2014an epistemology for\nagents who have both credences and all-or-nothing beliefs at the same\ntime; for details, see\n section 4.2 of the entry on formal representations of belief.\n\nIt is debatable which, if any, of the above topics can be adequately\naddressed in Bayesian epistemology. But Bayesians have been expanding\ntheir territory and their momentum will surely continue.\n\n",
