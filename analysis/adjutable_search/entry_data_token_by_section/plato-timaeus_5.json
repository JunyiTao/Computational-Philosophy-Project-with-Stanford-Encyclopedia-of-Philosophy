    "main_text": "The Receptacle\n6. The Receptacle\n\nTimaeus introduces the receptacle as a \u201cthird kind\u201d\n(triton genos, 48e4) alongside forms and their imitations. He\napologizes for the obscurity of the concept, and attempts to explicate\nits role by means of a series of analogies: it is variously compared\nto a lump of gold (50a4\u2013b5), a mother that together with a\nfather produces offspring (50d2\u20134, 51a4\u20135), a plastic,\nimpressionable stuff (50c2\u20136, e7\u201351a1), and an ointment\nthat serves as a neutral base for various fragrances (50e5\u20138).\nThese images suggest that it is devoid of any characteristics in its\nown right (except those formal characteristics necessary to its role,\nsuch as malleability). The receptacle is posited as the solution to a\nproblem: none of the observable particulars persists as this or that\n(for example as fire or water) over time. We observe the very thing\nthat is fire at one time becoming air, and subsequently becoming\nwater, etc., \u201ctransmitting their becoming to one another in a\ncycle, so it seems\u201d (49c6\u20137). Thus the thing that appears\nas fire here and now is not fire in its own right: its fieriness is\nonly a temporary characterization of it. What, then, is that thing in\nits own right? In a difficult and controversial passage Timaeus\nproposes a\n solution:[16]\n In its own right it is (part of) a totally characterless subject that\ntemporarily in its various parts gets characterized in various ways.\nThis is the receptacle\u2014an enduring substratum, neutral in itself\nbut temporarily taking on the various characterizations through traces\nof the four elements in it. The observed particulars just are parts of\nthat receptacle so characterized (51b4\u20136).\n\nThe above analogies may be seen as suggesting that the receptacle is a\nmaterial substratum: as gold qua gold is the material substratum for\nthe various geometrical configurations it is shaped into, the ointment\nbase for the fragrances, or the impressionable stuff for the various\nimpressions, so the receptacle serves as the \u201cstuff\u201d that\ngets characterized in various ways. But Timaeus does not use any\ndescriptive word that can suitably be translated as\n\u201cmatter\u201d or \u201cmaterial\u201d; he does, however, use\nthe word, \u201cspace\u201d (ch\u00f4ra). And its function\nof providing a \u201cseat\u201d (hedra, 52b1) reinforces\nthe conception that its role is to provide a spatial location for the\nthings that enter it and disappear from it (49e7\u20138,\n50c4\u20135, 52a4\u20136).\n\nThere has been considerable discussion about whether the receptacle is\nto be thought of as matter, or as space, and whether it is possible to\nthink of it coherently as having both of those roles. And there is\nalso ongoing disagreement about the nature of the entities that are\nsaid to enter into and disappear from the receptacle. They are clearly\nnot forms (52a4). Some interpreters have suggested that these are\ncharacter types (or character tokens) derived from the forms, and that\nthese types (or tokens) are properly the form copies\n(mim\u00eamata) that have a prominent place in the argument\nfor the receptacle (49c7\u201350a4). Whatever the merits of this\nreading, the things the receptacle is said to \u201creceive\u201d\nare \u201call the bodies (s\u00f4mata)\u201d (50b6).\nBodies are three-dimensional entities, and this makes it likely that\nit is the emergence and disappearance of the variously characterized\nobservable particulars as such, and not their properties (types or\ntokens), that are mentioned in these passages (49e7\u20138,\n50c4\u20135, 52a4\u20136). But the particular bodies have a\ngeometrical underpinning\u2014the four \u201celements\u201d,\nwhich are the building blocks of the physical world, are made up of\nthe so-called Platonic solids; and these solids, in turn, are made up\nof two kinds of triangles (cf. below). \n\nThe complete metaphysical scheme of the Timaeus that is summed up at\n50c7\u2013d4 and again at 52a1\u2013b5 is thus as follows: (i) the\neternal and unchanging forms, the \u201cmodel,\u201d or\n\u201cfather\u201d; (ii) the receptacle, or \u201cmother,\u201d\nand (iii) the copies of the model or \u201coffspring\u201d of the\nfather and the mother. These three are the components of Plato\u2019s\nanalysis; they are not three ontologically distinct ingredients. The\nreceptacle is introduced not as a distinct entity newly superadded to\nparticulars and forms, but as a new and essential component in the\nanalysis of what it is to be a spatio-temporal particular. What is\nmissing from that analysis, however, is any mention of character types\nor tokens, and while later philosophers might see a use for such\nconcepts in elucidating the metaphysical scheme of the\nTimaeus, it is not clear that Plato himself makes any use of\nthem there.\n\nThe introduction of the receptacle is an important innovation in\nPlato\u2019s metaphysics, and clearly a development that takes him\nbeyond the metaphysics of the middle\n dialogues.[17]\n Little attention was given in those dialogues to the question of what\nit is to be a sensible particular (other than being something that\nparticipates in forms), or what is required of particulars to be such\nthat forms may be exemplified in them. In order to be effective in\ntheir role of exemplifying forms, particulars must possess certain\ngeneral characteristics qua particulars: they must be spatially\nextended and spatially situated, and they must be constituted of some\nindeterminate but determinable \u201cstuff\u201d that is subject to\ndetermination by way of participating in forms. Although the\nreceptacle does not appear by name in any other of the later\ndialogues, it clearly has affinities to the concept of the\napeiron (indefinite or indeterminate) of the metaphysical\nscheme in the Philebus. It is impossible, however, to\ndetermine the chronological relation between these two dialogues with\ncertainty (see note 7), and thus impossible to infer which of the two\nschemes Plato might have thought to be the more definitive.\n",
