    "main_text": "A Systematic Realism\n4. A Systematic Realism\n\nIn Anderson\u2019s view the realist movement initiated by Russell and\nMoore had ended in failure because it had attempted to overcome\nHegelian philosophy by a return to pre-idealist certainties\n(EMP, 89). As a result, realism had been left without\na school from which to challenge the newly emerging schools of\nidealism and pragmatism (STP, 161). Hegel\u2019s\nall-encompassing system of thought was an example for a new and\nsystematic realism to emulate.\n\nIn brief, Hegel\u2019s attempt to formulate his sequence of outlooks\nrelies upon a realist view of the proposition which is incompatible\nwith his whole theory of outlooks or categories and their varying\nadequacy to reality as a whole. Hegel \u201cunwittingly is proceeding\nin terms of the proposition\u201d but is caught up with the illusory\nattempt to establish an overarching truth (\u201cthat whereby a true\nproposition can be true\u201d), instead of the task of establishing\ntrue propositions (JAA, Lectures on William\nJames, 1935). The same criticism of Hegel seems to be made by Brandom\nin the service of his very different expressionist project (Brandom\n2000). But for Anderson, Hegel\u2019s doctrine of outlooks\n\u201crests on an inability to grasp the independence of\ntruths\u201d (EMP, 81). On the other hand, we need\nonly reject Hegel\u2019s doctrine of expressions to find that we are\nleft with actual states of affairs rather than abstract\nbeing.\n\nNeither Cartesian rationalism nor English empiricism could replace\nHegel\u2019s philosophy with any philosophical position of comparable\nrange. Hegel was right to emphasise system, but not as totality (a\npretended solution to real problems), but in the form of a single\nlogic. He was also right to see this logic as historical, but wrong to\nattempt to replace a \u201clogic of things developing\u201d with the\nnotion of a \u201cdeveloping logic\u201d (EMP, 80).\nAnderson summarises the position as follows. The only way to answer\nHegel would be to drop the modern fixation with epistemological\nquestions altogether and return to a Greek consideration of things. In\naddition to Greek directness, a true replacement for Hegelian idealism\nwould incorporate three major components: a positive theory of the\nmind as feeling and as non-unitary, as much a part of spatial and\ntemporal reality as any non-mental things and events; a true\nempiricism which recognised relations and generals as being as real\n(and as knowable) as the particulars related; and a conception of\nspace and time as conditions of existence rather than of human\nknowledge as in Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism. Anderson\nproposed to replace Hegel\u2019s totality by developing a systematic\nrealism which would incorporate the work of John Burnet on Greek\nphilosophy, of Sigmund Freud on mind, of William James\u2019 radical\nempiricism and of Samuel Alexander\u2019s reworking of Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental aesthetic (EMP, 80). Anderson does not\nmention here another possible source for his direct realism, namely,\nScottish common sense philosophy, but he does consider this in his\nLectures on Thomas Reid of 1935 (LMP).\n\nRichard Rorty has suggested that English language philosophy in the\nearly 20th century emerged from the dominance of Hegelian idealism by\ndeferring to the natural sciences, partly because the alternative\nassociation with modernist literature seemed to threaten \u201ca kind\nof privatised aestheticism which contained disturbing strains of\nirrationalism\u201d (Rorty 1985, p. 748). Superficially,\nAnderson\u2019s work suggests an attempt of some kind to assimilate\nphilosophy to the sciences. But he was a true modernist in relation to\nliterary culture: his articles and addresses include critical works on\nsuch figures as, in particular, James Joyce, but also Lawrence, Shaw,\nWells, Grahame, Belloc, Wilde, Hardy, Ibsen, Meredith, Dostoevsky and\nMelville, as well as on the genre of detective fiction. Literature for\nAnderson had a special character as the embodiment or repository of\nculture (JAA, Lectures on the Educational Theories of\nSpencer and Dewey, 1949). At Sydney in the 1930s he championed both\nthe works of James Joyce (recently banned) and the importance of\nFreudian psychoanalysis to our understanding of mentality as\nconflicted and passionate, and to cultural inquiry more generally\n(cf., Damousi 2005). He thought the pre-modernist \u201cliterary\nphilosophers\u201d of romanticism and idealism had shown\n\u201cgreater tenacity\u201d than those philosophers who professed\nscientific exactitude (EMP, 80). But they had also\ntended to promote forms of moralising and theologising which were\nopposed to precision and independence of thought and which were\n\u201cdetrimental to culture in general\u201d (EMP,\n87). Anderson thought his interpretation of traditional Aristotelian\nlogic had an important role to play in the new world of literary\nculture as much as in the natural sciences.\n\nOne major achievement of Hegel for Anderson was the encouragement he\ngave to the study of Greek philosophers. Anderson\u2019s lectures\nexplored the historical background to his propositional view of\nreality in the issues raised by the pre-Socratics and later in\nPlato\u2019s Dialogues. Like other modernist philosophers and\nnovelists (and Hegel himself), Anderson found in Heraclitus an\ninspirational alternative to what he came to regard as the sentimental\nand intellectually stifling idealism of his teachers.\n\nThis world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or man has made;\nbut it was ever, is now, and ever shall be an ever-living Fire, with\nmeasures of it kindling and measures going out. (Heraclitus Fragment\n20. trans. John Burnet, Early Greek Philosophy 4th Ed., 1930,\np.134.)\n\n\nAnderson acknowledged that Heraclitus\u2019 emphasis on the element\nFire might be read as a typically Ionian response to the question\n\u201cwhat is the world made of\u201d, but the more important theme\nis his treatment of fire purely as process, as transaction and\nexchange, as the paradigm element of strife and harmony. In embryo\nAnderson found in Heraclitus so many of his own principles: the close\nlink between logic and ethics (ethics as the field in which conflict\ncomes primarily to the fore); the single way of being, of \u201cwhat\nis common\u201d (the search for a general logic, a theory of the\ncommensurability of things in terms of a theory of process); the\nrecognition of complexity, conflict and strife underlying existing\nthings; the anti-sentimentality and pessimism which refuses to find\nsolace in unity; the hidden harmony of forces in balance preferable to\nthe open harmony of illusory unity; the unremitting attack on\nsubjectivist illusions of desiring or imagining things as we would\nlike them to be (unchanging and secure) rather than seeing them for\nwhat they are.\n\nFor Anderson\u2019s Heraclitus, \u201cseeing things as they\nare\u201d is seeing them as complex, active and changing; a\nperspective opposed to the optimistic, rationalist illusion of the\nsimple, fixed and static. It is to see things as moving, historical,\nin process, and yet as in balance. Heraclitean \u201cstrife\u201d is\nharmony: the things of everyday experience are positive and concrete\nbecause they are contingent and historical. Anderson described this\n\u201cfundamental strain\u201d in all fields of inquiry as that\n\u201cbetween objectivism and subjectivism\u201d, between\n\u201ccritical thinking\u201d recognising complexity and tension\neverywhere, and \u201crationalist illusion\u201d seeking the fixed\nand simple (JAA, Lectures on Criticism 1955, number 11.).\nRationalism here shared with more primitive mythological thinking the\nquest for stability, security and moral uplift. Both have looked for\nsolutions at a higher level than the problems being addressed.\n\nAnderson\u2019s teaching and writings constantly refer to the history\nof philosophy, but Anderson was not a scholarly historian. He thought\nthat persistent philosophical issues and positions were evident\nthroughout history (eleaticism, for example, was a highly instructive\nand critical stage recurring throughout the history of the subject\n\u2013 for example in Green\u2019s criticisms of Hume\u2019s\nparticulars). The history of philosophy helped to emphasise the value\nof his own position. On the other hand, his lectures and writings are\nladen with references to philosophers, scientists, novelists,\npsychoanalysts and revolutionaries. Nothing seems alien to even the\nmost abstruse topic of discussion in his work. And his lectures were\n\u201cgreat starters of hares\u201d (Partridge\u2019s reflections\non Anderson\u2019s teaching, in EAI). John Passmore\nacknowledges the inspiration of Anderson\u2019s lectures in his own\nworks on Hume, philosophical reasoning, Ralph Cudworth, perfectibility\nand his history of one hundred years of philosophy.\n",
