    "main_text": "Life\n2. Works and Reputation\n\nPico\u2019s modern fame comes mainly from a speech that he never\ngave, the Oration on the Dignity of Man that got its title\nonly after he died. He wrote the Oration in 1486 to introduce\nhis 900 Conclusions, having chosen the capital of Christendom\nas just the place to dispute the outrageous theological novelties\nadvertised by them\u2014including the claim that magic and Kabbalah\nare the best proofs of Christ\u2019s divinity. The Pope quashed\nPico\u2019s rash project, but not before the Conclusions\nwere already in print. To make matters worse, Pico then defended them\nin an unsubmissive Apology that printed half of the original,\nand not yet published, Oration\u2014though not the half that\nlater became famous. As a whole, and mainly because its language is\nenigmatic, the Oration was less inflammatory than the\nConclusions; it first appeared in the collection of his\nuncle\u2019s works (Commentationes) published by\nGianfrancesco Pico in 1496. Gianfrancesco, the main source of\nbiographical information about the elder Pico, says that his uncle\nthought little of the speech, regarding it as a piece of juvenilia.\nFor the next three centuries, few of Pico\u2019s readers were moved\nto challenge this verdict, despite the author\u2019s continuing fame.\nUntil post-Kantian historians of philosophy were charmed by it, the\nOration was largely (though not entirely) ignored, in part\nbecause of its publishing history.\n\nShortly after 1450, Giannozzo Manetti had completed a book On\nHuman Worth and Excellence, which\u2014unlike Pico\u2019s\nspeech\u2014really is about dignitas as that word had been\nused by ancient Romans and medieval Christians: what they meant by it\nwas \u2018rank,\u2019 \u2018status,\u2019 \u2018value\u2019 or\n\u2018worth,\u2019 not what Kant would mean later by\nW\u00fcrde. Manetti\u2019s dignitas was still\nessentially a Christian notion made less otherworldly by the example\nof ancient sages like Cicero and by the changed conditions of Italian\nlife in the fifteenth century. The last part of Manetti\u2019s book\nis an attack on a twelfth-century treatise On Human Misery by\nCardinal Lotario dei Segni, before he became Pope Innocent III.\nManetti took his lead from two contemporaries\u2014Antonio da Barga\nand Bartolomeo Facio\u2014who had already written about his topic but\nin much more conventional ways. Pico\u2019s speech pays no attention\nat all to these three earlier texts on dignitas because\ndignitas is not his subject. Instead, he wanted to convince\npeople to use magic and Kabbalah in order to change themselves into\nangels.\n\nExcept as part of Pico\u2019s collected works, the Latin text of the\nOration was printed only once before the 1940s, when the\nfirst translation into English also appeared, just after the first\nItalian version in 1936. What readers saw on the title-page of the\n1496 Commentationes was simply A Very Elegant\nOration, which in 1530\u2014in the only separately published\nLatin text of the pre-modern era\u2014expanded into On Man by\nGiovanni Pico della Mirandola, explaining the loftier mysteries of\nsacred and human philosophy. Meanwhile, the front-matter of the\nfive collected editions or reprints between 1498 and 1521 stayed with\nthe 1496 formulation, Oratio quaedam elegantissima, which in\n1557 finally became On the Dignity of Man in a Basel\ncollection and, in a Venice edition of the same year, A Very\nElegant Oration on the High Nobility and Dignity of Man. The two\nother early modern collections of 1572 and 1601 used a new format that\nno longer listed contents by title at the front of the book.\n\nThe British Library Catalog, which has about 1300 entries for books by\nErasmus published by 1700, has about 100 for Pico. During the same\nperiod, when Marsilio Ficino\u2019s De vita libri tres went\nthrough more than thirty editions, Pico\u2019s Latin\nOration\u2014far better known to modern readers than\nFicino\u2019s Three Books on Life\u2014got almost no\nattention from publishers. Of the five dozen or so Pico titles that\nfound a publisher by 1700, about half were collections of letters. The\nfirst two, called Golden Letters, were incunabular editions,\nand the letters also figured prominently in early collections of\nPico\u2019s works, whose front-matter listed Ficino, Poliziano and\nother cultural celebrities with whom Pico corresponded\n\nTwo things made Pico\u2019s Latin letters a durable commercial hit:\ncelebrity and education. Since Latin was still the main medium of\nlearned communication in the late seventeenth century, when Isaac\nNewton published his Principia in that undead language,\neducated people kept writing letters in Latin and used writers like\nPico as models. And Pico was attractive not only because of his\nelegant style but also because he had been a celebrity in his own\nlifetime and remained so in Newton\u2019s day. He stayed famous in\nthree ways: as a critic of astrology; as an expert on Kabbalah; and as\nthe amazing Pico\u2014as the Phoenix who blazed through a brief life\nin the triple glare of an old aristocratic society, a new mandarin\nculture of classical scholarship and, in his last years, the\nmillenarian fantasies of Savonarola\u2019s Florence. Noble origins,\nfashionable friends, physical beauty, prodigious learning, capacious\nmemory, scholarly journeys, youthful sins, trouble with the Church,\neventual repentance and a pious death: these are the motifs of the\nfamily hagiography by his nephew that have kept Giovanni Pico famous\nfor being famous over the centuries.\n\nBecause he died so young, Pico finished very little and published\nless: the vernacular Commento was neither completed nor\npublished in his lifetime; the Conclusions are just bare\nstatements of theses; half of the preface to the rushed\nApology was lifted from the unpublished Oration;\nOn Being and the One is a small piece of a larger effort to\nharmonize Plato and Aristotle; and Gianfrancesco found the unfinished\nDisputations Against Astrology bundled with his dead\nuncle\u2019s papers. Pico had only three works printed in his\nlifetime: the Conclusions, the Apology and the\nHeptaplus. \n\nThe Apology, which defends the Conclusions against\ncharges of heresy, is Pico\u2019s longest piece of philosophical\nwriting, and eleven of its thirteen parts are conventional scholastic\nphilosophy in the manner of Aquinas, Scotus and Ockham. But his\nsources for the Apology were also Durand de Saint-Pour\u00e7ain,\nHenry of Ghent, Jean Quidort, Robert Holcot and a dozen other\nlesser-known scholastics. Since most of the content of the\nConclusions and all its presentation is also thoroughly\nscholastic, Pico did not present himself as a humanist in his first\ntwo printed works, which were the basis of his reputation during his\nlifetime, except on his home turf in Tuscany and the Emilia-Romagna.\nHe wrote the two epistolary essays on poetry and philosophical\nlanguage in the humanist style, but few saw them during his lifetime.\nBesides the Conclusions and the Apology, the only\nwork that Pico completed and made public in print while he lived was\nthe Heptaplus (1489), a Kabbalist commentary on the first 26\nverses of Genesis.\n\nThat topic, called Ma\u2019aseh Bereshit or the Work of the\nBeginning, was a favorite of Menahem Recanati, Abraham Abulafia and\nother Kabbalists whom Pico knew through learned Italian Jews,\nincluding Elia del Medigo, Flavius Mithridates and Yohanan Alemanno.\nKabbalah, which Pico saw as the holier Hebrew analog of the gentile\n\u2018ancient theology\u2019 revealed by Marsilio Ficino, is\nprovocatively on display in the 900 Conclusions: 119 of them,\nincluding the final and culminating 72, are Kabbalist\ntheses\u2014outlandishly Kabbalist from a Christian point of view.\nPico\u2019s project, part of a search for harmonies connecting all\nthe world\u2019s wisdom traditions, was to ground primary doctrines\nof Christology and trinitarian theology in Kabbalah, which he traced\nto the oral Torah confided to Moses and passed on in secret through\nEsdras and other sages. Because of its Mosaic origin, Kabbalah was\nholier to Pico than the pagan wisdom that Ficino had traced to\nZoroaster and Hermes Trismegistus, in ancient Chaldaea and Egypt,\nwhere Ficino found the beginnings of Platonic philosophy. Pico was the\nfirst Christian who had the expertise, including a little Hebrew and\nAramaic, to back up the astonishing claims that would make Kabbalah\nthe core of the ancient theology.\n\nAlthough Kabbalist writings had first appeared in the twelfth century,\nChristians before Pico knew almost nothing about them. The Kabbalah\nthat he discovered for the Latin West is a theory as well as a\npractice, at bottom a kind of biblical hermeneutics. And for some\nKabbalists, then and now, textual theorizing underwrites a spiritual\npractice whose aim is mystical ascent for the excitation of prophetic\nor messianic states by various techniques, including magic and\ntheurgy. Many Kabbalists believe that the Hidden God, called the\nInfinite, reveals himself not only in the Bible but also through ten\nemanations or attributes, the Sefirot. Hypostasized in myths,\nmade concrete by images and symbolized by letters and numbers, the\nSefirot are at the core of Kabbalist speculation, whose other\nmajor focus is the names of God and their resonance in words of\nscripture.\n\nKabbalists regard the meaning of God\u2019s sacred speech, the Hebrew\ntext of the Bible, as infinite, finding significance even in its\nsmallest particles\u2014not only the divine words but also their\nletters (which are also numbers) and even the shapes of those letters.\nThe most powerful words are God\u2019s names, the holiest of which,\nthe Tetragrammaton, cannot be uttered; written as YHWH, it is\npronounced Adonai, a spoken name like Elohim,\nEhyeh, El Shaddai and others used of God in the\nHebrew Bible. Other words of great power are the names of the\nSefirot, which are unknown, as such, to the Bible; they are\nnames not of God but of aspects or manifestations or emanations of\ndivinity.\n\nSince God in his highest essence remains hidden, finite beings can\nknow the Infinite only in so far as it descends from its secret\nheights. The last moments of that descent make up the world of common\nhuman awareness. The first moments, far beyond the reach of ordinary\nperception, are the ten Sefirot. Much of the literature of\nKabbalah tries to describe the Sefirot, often as shown in\nFigure 1, where all ten (designated\nS1 through S10) are arranged in a\ndiagram or \u2018tree.\u2019 The major names in Hebrew of\nS4, for example, are Gedullah and\nHesed, meaning Greatness and Love or Piety, rendered by Pico\nas Amor or Pietas. The divine name usually\nassociated with S4 is El, but Pico knew that\nKabbalists use many other words and names (Abraham, Michael, the\nSouth, Water) to describe S4. The terminology that\nPico used for the Sefirot, which he called\n\u2018numerations\u2019 in Latin, is displayed in more detail in\nFigure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nS1 Keter\n\nCrown\n\nFatum Supremum\n\n\u2019Ehyeh\n \n\n S3 Binah\n\nIntelligence\n\nIntelligentia\n\nYHWH (\u2019Elohim)\n\n\n\n S2 Hochmah\n\nWisdom\n\nSapientia\n\nYah\n\n \n\n S5 Gevurah/Din\n\nPower/Judgment\n\nPotentia/Judicium\n\n\u2019Elohim\n\n S4 Gedullah/Hesed\n\nGreatness/Love or Piety\n\nAmor or Pietas\n\n\u2019El \n\n\n S6 Tiferet/Rahamim\n\nBeauty/Compassion\n\nTipheret/Clementia\n\nYHWH (\u2019Adonay)\n \n\n S8 Hod\n\nMajesty\n\nDecor\n\n\u2019Elohim Tseb\u2019aot\n\n S7 Netsah\n\nEndurance\n\nEternitas\n\nYHWH Tseb\u2019aot \n\n\n S9 Tsaddiq/Yesod\n\nRighteous/Foundation\n\nJustus/Fundamentum\n\n\u2019El Hay/Shaddai\n\n\n \n\n\nS10 Malkut/ \u2018Atarah\n\nKingdom/Diadem\n\nRegnum\n\n\u2019Adonai\n \n\n\nFigure 1.

Pico\u2019s Sefirot\n(Numerations)\n\n\nPico was the first Christian to treat knowledge of Kabbalah as\nvaluable. Flavius Mithridates, his most prolific Jewish informant,\ntranslated (and mistranslated) thousands of pages of Kabbalah into\nLatin for him. Large portions of the Oration, drawing on\nthese texts, are also informed by Kabbalah in ways that no\ncontemporary Christian could have detected\u2014least of all a\nChristian who lacked the clues provided by the Conclusions.\nThe esoteric intention of Pico\u2019s thought, proclaimed\nemphatically in the Oration, is the feature that most\ndistances it from the whole project of post-Cartesian philosophy in\nthe West and also from earlier philosophies outside the Platonic\ntradition. Wishing not just to mystify but also to provoke, Pico\nsucceeded and paid the price of the Church\u2019s censure.\n\nTheology, spirituality and philosophy\u2014all in the broadest\nsense\u2014are the main topics of Pico\u2019s Kabbalah, which shows\n(or hints) how God reveals himself in the Sefirot, the divine\nnames and the words of scripture. In the 72 Kabbalist theses at the\nend of the Conclusions, this revelation becomes Christology\nand Trinitarian theology. From a Kabbalist point of view, the\nSefirot and the divine names are actors in dramas of\ntheology, cosmology, anthropology and angelology whose major themes\nare exile, death, atonement and redemption, stories that Pico\ntransposes onto the Christian Trinity, with Jesus Christ, the Messiah,\nas the saving hero.\n\nAccordingly, leading points of spiritual practice in the\nConclusions are prayer, prophecy and ascent to mystical union\nwith God, which is also the main topic of the\nOration, where Pico makes positive use of magic and theurgy\nas steps toward the ascent. The Conclusions, which confirm\nthis endorsement of magic, also show in greater detail than the\nOration why Pico links magic with Kabbalah. He sees it as a\nspiritual technique which, like the higher theurgy of the Neoplatonic\nphilosophers, locates and opens routes to God which ordinarily are\nunknown to humans. The practice of Kabbalah starts with theory because\nthese hidden channels of divinity must be disclosed and interpreted\nbefore they can be used: spirituality follows hermeneutics.\n\nTechnical details of hermeneutics are the most obscure material in the\nConclusions, especially Pico\u2019s speculations about\nHebrew words and letters. Language is the gateway to wisdom, the\nelements of language are letters and numbers, and these signs\nproliferate in secret codes. Pico\u2019s genius and ambition, which\nthe Church would see as impudence, attracted him to this provocative\ntheology of the hidden word, whose enigmas and ambiguities encouraged\nhis fascination with the esoteric. The larger Kabbalist project of the\nConclusions, and hence of the Kabbalah in the\nOration, is Christological and Trinitarian. The smaller\nexhibitions of Kabbalah that Pico uses to support his grand theory\nfocus on particular Biblical texts, which are also illuminated by the\nGentile wisdom of the ancient theologians.\n\nZoroaster, Hermes Trismegistus, Orpheus, Pythagoras and other ancient\ntheologians are among the authorities from whom Pico derives his 900\ntheses, but so are Aquinas, Albertus and other scholastics, Averroes,\nAvicenna and other Muslims as well as Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus,\nProclus and the Greek commentators. The Conclusions are,\namong other things, an egregious advertisement of Pico\u2019s\nlearning in a catalog of philosophical propositions which are often\nchallenging to orthodoxy and sometimes paradoxical\u2014a word that\nPico himself used to describe some of his propositions, whose\nancestors were the quodlibetal theses debated in medieval\nuniversities. He ascribed only the last group of about 500 to himself,\nattaching the first set of roughly 400 to ancient and medieval\nauthorities, among whom were the Kabbalists\u2014by far the least\nfamiliar to Pico\u2019s contemporaries.\n\nIn the Heptaplus of 1489 we can still hear the Kabbalist\nvoice of the Conclusions, but mainly because Pico\u2019s\nearlier works since the Commento of 1485\u20136 have\nprepared us to listen for it. Although all these texts discuss\nKabbalah more openly than the Heptaplus, they seem to have\nmade little impression on Pico\u2019s contemporaries. Roberto\nSalviati, a well informed Florentine who knew Pico well, called the\nHeptaplus \u201cthe first fruits of his studies\u201d when\nhe arranged to have it printed. That Salviati thought the\nCommento, Conclusions and Apology\nnegligible or embarrassing is more likely than that he did not know\nthose works. Simple ignorance is likelier in the case of the\nOration, which Pico\u2019s nephew would later describe as\nhaving been kept out of circulation by his uncle. For readers whom\nKabbalah might alienate, the Heptaplus was not much of a\nthreat because Pico had sanitized it. (For the best account of the\nHeptaplus, see the book by Crofton Black (2006).\n\nAlthough Genesis was not as attractive to Christian interpreters as\nJob or the Psalms, explicating the creation narrative of Gen.\n1:1\u201326 had been a task of hermeneutics since the great hexameral\ncommentaries of Basil of Caesarea and Ambrose. Like all of the Bible,\nthe creation story was thought to have three layers of meaning beyond\nits literal or \u2018historical\u2019 sense: allegorical,\ntropological and anagogical. The standard view was that \u201chistory\ntalks about events, allegory about how one thing is understood from\nanother, tropology discusses morals, \u2026 and anagogy is the\nspiritual meaning \u2026 that leads to higher things.\u201d The\nHeptaplus proposes and practices a new kind of allegory, a\nmethod derived from the structure of creation itself and directed\ntoward a new type of anagogy or ascent to supreme bliss\n(felicitas) in the Godhead.\n\nPico provides the key to his system only in the last part of the\nHeptaplus, which seems to be an appendix tacked on to the\nwork\u2014just another display of the author\u2019s virtuoso skill\nin Hebrew. But to learned Jews of the day, whether they were Kabbalist\nor not, Pico\u2019s analysis of the Hebrew letters of the first word\nof Genesis (Bereshit, \u201cIn the beginning\u201d) would\nhave seemed crude and simple-minded. Only from a Christian perspective\nwas there anything exotic in it, and its main effect on Christians\nwould have been to dazzle them with art.\n\nThis seemingly extraneous ending is actually a grand and arcane\nfinale. It hints at a secret that no Christian of Pico\u2019s day\ncould have grasped: that Moses himself, the author of the creation\nstory, had passed through 49 Gates of Understanding\u20147 \u00d7\n7\u2014on his way to the fiftieth, the supreme and final Gate to\nunion with God. The 49 preliminary Gates are all the compartments of\ncreation, which in turn demonstrate Pico\u2019s new allegorical\nmethod by exemplifying it: the universe of existence is also the\nuniverse of understanding that shows the path to mystical union.\n\nAlthough Pico does not explain the Gates in the 900\nConclusions, he does mention them in a way that gave later\nscholars, like Johann Reuchlin, the clues that they needed to find\nsuch enigmas in Kabbalist texts and then decipher them. The short\nversion of the story is that Wisdom, the second Sefirah\n(S2; see Fig. 1) builds the\npalace of Intelligence (S3) and carves 50 Gates into\nit, 7 revealed in each of the 7 lower Sefirot\n(S1-7) and another one unrevealed.\nThe 50 Gates, also called the Jubilee, correspond to the 50-year\nfestival ordained in Leviticus but also to a millenarian Great Jubilee\nof 50,000 years, when the 7 sabbatical cycles or weeks of 7,000 years\ncome to an end. After the lower Sefirot collapse into\nS3 in a final millennium, the cycle starts again,\nhaving been completed in that last generation of a thousand\nyears\u2014in the Sabbath of the Shekinah\n(S10). This Sabbath, the seventh day of rest after\nthe six days of creation, is Pico\u2019s ultimate allegory of\nmystical union, the secret encoded not only in the letters of\nBereshit but also in the sevenfold structure of the\nHeptaplus itself.\n\nBut who knew or could have known? In 1489, when the Heptaplus\nwas published, its only informed readership was the handful of learned\nJews in Italy who could also read Latin\u2014the very people who had\ntaught Pico himself enough Kabbalah to fill his Conclusions\nwith it. In the Heptaplus, however, even where its structure\nand content obviously depend on Kabbalah, Pico suppresses what the\nJews had taught him, until the final exposition of Bereshit\nthat could only have baffled Christian readers if it did not offend\nthem. As in his earlier works, Pico intends to mystify because he\nbelieves that the highest and most sacred wisdom must not be divulged\nin plain language. He wants God\u2019s secrets to be understood only\nby an \u00e9lite clever enough to unravel the allegories that\nconceal them. The surprising thing, in the Western tradition of\nphilosophy, is that Pico thinks of this project as philosophical.\n\nDespite Pico\u2019s effort to keep Kabbalah so well hidden in the\nHeptaplus that Christians would not reject the book outright,\nit was the extravagant and explicit theosophy of the\nConclusions, framed posthumously by the Oration,\nthat made him the patriarch of Christian Kabbalah. Reuchlin and other\nmasters of this new syncretism looked back to Pico as their model;\nGerman theologians and biblical scholars were still debating his\ntheses when the young Immanuel Kant began teaching in K\u00f6nigsberg.\nBut by the end of the eighteenth century, Kant had so thoroughly\nrevolutionized philosophy that its history had to be reformulated in\nKantian terms. In practice, the task was to update the huge\nCritical History of Philosophy produced by Jacob Brucker in\n1742, where the eclectic Brucker describes Pico as that worst of all\nmonsters, a Platonizing, Judaizing syncretist. Half a century later,\nWilhelm Tennemann began the revisionist History of Philosophy\n(1798\u20131819) in which Pico makes his first appearance as a\nproto-Kantian advocate of human freedom and dignity.\n\nIn the first few pages of the Oration\u2014pages read more\noften than any other product of Renaissance Latin humanism\u2014God\ntells Adam that he, alone of all creatures, can make himself what he\nwants to be. Fascinated by this stirring prelude to a longer speech,\nTennemann, and many readers after him, have taken Pico\u2019s\noratorical prelude as evidence of a morality grounded, like\nKant\u2019s, in human freedom and dignity. Having gathered strength\nduring the nineteenth century, and having acquired a romantic patina,\nthis view of Pico\u2014and, by implication, of Renaissance\nhumanism\u2014reached its peak with the great Neo-Kantian of his age,\nErnst Cassirer. When Cassirer and Paul Kristeller, also a Kantian,\ncame to the United States, they brought their Kantian Pico with them,\nlaunching his long career in university textbooks of \u2018Western\nCivilization\u2019 after World War II. Meanwhile, Eugenio Garin had\npublished what is still the most important book on Pico in the Fascist\nItaly of 1937, just before the racial laws were put into force.\n\nThe most conspicuous pages of the Oration, celebrated by\nGarin and many others as the humanist charter of human freedom and\ndignity, are just the first few. Assured by them that we can\nbe what we want to be, we are then told\u2014contrary to the\nusual interpretation of the Oration\u2014that what we\nmust be is not human at all. We must become\nangels\u2014bodiless, sexless and ultimately, that most unromantic of\nall conditions, selfless in the strictest sense. Cherubim,\nthe next-to-highest angels, are the first higher stage that we must\nreach, and to achieve that lofty state we must shed not only the body\nthat imprisons us but also the identity and personality that\ndistinguish us from all other individuals and from God. Mystical union\nwith God is Pico\u2019s final goal, and extinguishing the self is a\nnecessary consequence of achieving it. \u201cLet a holy\nambition possess our spirit,\u201d Pico writes.\n\nLet us climb for the heights, panting; and let us strive with all our\nmight to reach them, since we can do it if we will it. Let us scorn\nthe things of earth, let us despise those of heaven, and then, leaving\nbehind whatever is of the world, let us fly up to the hypercosmic\ncourt nearest the most exalted divinity\u2026. As we emulate the\nCherubic life on earth, checking the impulses of the emotions through\nmoral knowledge, dispelling the darkness of reason through dialectic,\nlet us cleanse the soul by washing away the dirt of ignorance and vice\nso that the emotions will not rage in fury nor reason go mad and\nfoolish. Then let us flood the soul, purified and well tempered, with\nthe light of natural philosophy so that finally we may perfect it with\nknowledge of divinity\u2026. [Then] we will fully enjoy the peace\nthat we have longed for\u2014the holiest peace, the unbreakable bond,\nthe friendship of the single-souled wherein all our\nspirits do not so much converge in the one mind above every mind as in\nsome unsayable way emerge as absolutely one. This is that\nfriendship which the Pythagoreans say is the end of all philosophy.\nThis is that peace which God gives on high and angels descending to\nearth have announced to men of good will so that through this peace\nthese same men, ascending to heaven, might be made into\nangels\u2026. Ever forgetful of herself, [the soul] will wish to\ndie in herself that she might live in her spouse, in whose sight\nthe death of his saints is most precious\u2014death, I say, if one\nshould use the word \u2018death\u2019 for that fullness of life\nwhose contemplation the sages have said is the aim of\nphilosophy\u2026. Lifted now to the topmost height of her\nwatchtower, for all eternity looking out without interruption over\nwhat is, what will be and what has been, we shall sing prophecies like\nPhoebus, and, gazing up at primeval beauty, we shall be its winged\nlovers, until at last, with a love that cannot be described, driven\nwild by desire and transported beyond ourselves like burning Seraphs,\nfull of divine power, we shall be ourselves no longer, but shall\nbe Him, the very one who made us.\n\n\nAt the lowest level of a self-annihilating paideia, the\nmystic starts as a philosopher\u2014with ethics, logic, natural\nphilosophy and theology\u2014before ascending through the arcana of\nmagic and Kabbalah to drown the self in the abyss of divinity. This is\nnot a Kantian project, and the Oration on the Dignity of Man\nthat locates the human condition in human freedom and dignity is a\ntext created by us post-Kantians, not by Giovanni Pico.\n\nThe outline of the Oration given below is also not\nPico\u2019s. Its seven parts may or may not be what he had in mind,\nbut from the layout of the 900 Conclusions it is clear that\nhe thought along numerological lines. Moreover, the title and\norganization of the Heptaplus show that 7 was a particularly\nmeaningful number to him\u2014like so many other seekers of secrets.\nThe full title is Heptaplus, on the Sevenfold Account of the Six\nDays of Genesis, surely an invitation to ponder arithmetical\nmysteries. Since this work of 1489 restates a theme\u2014ascending to\nfelicitas or supreme happiness\u2014that had occupied Pico\nsince the Commento of 1485\u20136, it would not be\nsurprising to find that its sevenfold structure derives from earlier\nwritings, including the Oration. That famous speech can be\nanalyzed as follows:\n\nMan is the greatest wonder because he can choose to transform\nhimself.\nIn order to choose well, however, he must emulate the angels.\nIn order to emulate the angels, he must learn how to live the\nangelic life\u2014specifically, the Cherubic life.\nThis lesson, a curriculum, can be learned from the ancient\nfathers, who are\n\n\n Paul and Dionysius\n Jacob\n Job\n Moses\n The ancient theologians (Orpheus, Socrates, Plato, Plotinus)\n Pythagoras\n Zoroaster, the Chaldaeans, Abraham and Jeremiah\n\n Because it is philosophy that leads to the Cherubic life, Pico\nproclaims himself a philosopher.\n And the study of philosophy has also led Pico to other new\ndoctrines, notably magic and Kabbalah.\n Therefore, despite the complaints of his critics, Pico will\nundertake his philosophical disputation.\n\n\nThe lesson taught seven times in the central part of the\nOration (part 4 above) is a curriculum whose\nfelicitous goal is mystical union with God: first elaborated by the\nancient Neoplatonists, it was taken up by the Church Fathers and\nbecame a commonplace of Christian mysticism, though Pico would also\nhave found it in such Kabbalist texts as the commentary on the Song of\nSongs by Levi ben Gerson. The student starts with moral philosophy and\nthen moves through dialectic and natural philosophy toward theology,\nuntil discursive thought gives way to ecstasy, pure contemplation and\nfinally unification. The stages of this paideia are\n\n moral philosophy\n dialectic\n natural philosophy\n theology\n magic\n Kabbalah\n mystical union\n\n\nMagic and Kabbalah are preliminary to union in this process but still\nimportant. By propelling the soul through the heavens toward\nsupercelestial divinity, magic assists the transition from natural\nphilosophy to natural theology and beyond, while Kabbalah, which rises\nhigher than any discursive theology, changes humans into angels purged\nof all traces of matter and thus prepared for hen\u00f4sis\nor absolute unification with God. The philosophical theory behind this\nspirituality goes back to the Greek Commentators on Aristotle and\nbecomes more explicit in Avicenna, Averroes and other Muslim sages. In\nphilosophical terms that were certainly controversial, but far more\nfamiliar than Kabbalah, Pico\u2019s aim was conjunction with the\nAgent Intellect.\n\nIn Pico\u2019s lifetime, of course, even his less obscure views about\nmystical union were little known because the texts were either not\npublished or not comprehensible to a Latin readership. Gianfrancesco\nPico, in the Life of Pico that accompanies the correspondence\nthat the nephew also edited, tried to rescue his uncle\u2019s\nreputation. The final item in Pico\u2019s bibliography, the\nDisputations Against Astrology is, like the letters,\nproblematic in its textual history because of Gianfrancesco\u2019s\ninvolvement in its publication. (The best account of the\nDisputations is the article by Anthony Grafton listed in\nPichiana by Quaquarelli and Zanardi.)\n\nThe unfinished Disputations is a long and unwelcoming book,\nmade all the more forbidding by its ragged presentation and reliance\non so many obscure and technical sources; much of it repeats and\nreinforces ancient and medieval objections to astrology. Pico extends\nPtolemy\u2019s doubts about a few astrological practices, for\nexample, into a broader restriction on celestial influences, which he\nfinds either too diffuse or too slight to be the basis of precise\npredictions. He exposes the claims made by astrologers who often\ncontradicted themselves and violated the canons of reason and\nexperience that the sciences must rely upon. The logical,\nmethodological and epistemological complaints compiled by Pico had\nbeen well known since before the ancient sceptics recorded their\nobjections. Pico\u2019s real breakthrough was to use humanist\nphilology as a new weapon against astrology, which he does not reject\ncategorically.\n\nPart of astrology\u2019s credibility was its pedigree, its long\ndescent from sages of ancient Chaldaea and Egypt. The Oration\nand Conclusions authenticate this genealogy by reinforcing it\nwith the even more venerable tradition of Kabbalah. Like Kabbalah,\nastrology was also made plausible by classicism, the new humanist\nculture that measured the authority of a doctrine by its age. Since\nastrology could claim a record of observing planets and stars over\nseveral millennia, it had stood the test of primordial time as its\nexperience accumulated.\n\nIn the Disputations that he did not live to finish, Pico now\nrejected this static mytho-history. Calling on new techniques of\nbiblical and historical chronology, he relocated such cardinal figures\nas Zoroaster in the human landscape of historical time, thus making\nthem subject to what would later be called \u2018historical\ncriticism.\u2019 Pico\u2019s critical sense was far from modern,\nhowever. When he attacked Chaldaean stargazers as ignorant and\nsuperstitious, part of what he found credulous was their obsession\nwith mathematics. Although Pico\u2019s attitude to mathematics was\nscarcely progressive, following the Aristotelian convention, his\nDisputations eventually attracted Kepler\u2019s attention,\nas well as praise from the later historians and philologists who used\nhis re-dating of the Eastern sages to greatly diminish\u2014if not to\neliminate\u2014the allure of the ancient theology.\n\nPico\u2019s least eccentric work of philosophy is the little treatise\nOn Being and the One: it takes an Aristotelian position\nagainst a Neoplatonic distinction between being and the One that made\nthe latter higher than the former in the order of the All. In effect,\nsince Marsilio Ficino had developed just such a position, Pico\u2019s\nessay was a challenge to the older philosopher, who saw it as such,\nand objected politely. Pico\u2019s larger purpose was to harmonize\nAristotle with Plato, which had also been the goal of many of the\nancient commentators on Aristotle, most of whom were Neoplatonists\nthemselves. But Pico was not Platonic enough to suit Ficino, just as\nhe was not Aristotelian enough for doctrinaire Aristotelians. The\nfuture was on Pico\u2019s side, however, inasmuch as most of the\nAristotelianism of the sixteenth century would be eclectic, though not\nas concordist as Pico would have liked. Eclectic critics of the\nEnlightenment, like Jacob Brucker, despised Pico\u2019s concordism\nand called it \u201csyncretism.\u201d\n\nFicino\u2019s irenic disposition also encouraged concordism, which\nwas more than just compatible with the historiography of\nphilosophy\u2014the ancient theology\u2014that he promoted in all\nhis works as a way to Christianize the heritage of pagan wisdom. In\ngeneral, Ficino welcomed Pico as a junior ally in that same cause, as\nevidenced by the warm personal language of the correspondence between\nthe two thinkers. It is striking, however, that Ficino\u2019s\nletters, published by him in his own lifetime, in 1495, testify better\nto his friendship with Pico than Pico\u2019s letters, published in\n1496 by his nephew, Gianfrancesco, who also prepared the\nDisputations for the press in that same year. A close reading\nof both epistolaries suggests that the younger Pico\u2014who was at\nleast as close to Savonarola as his uncle\u2014intervened to make the\nelder Pico\u2019s letters, as they appeared in the collected works\nthat the nephew edited in 1496, underwrite the pious Life\nthat introduces the whole collection.\n\nThe Pico of that Life is a Savonarolan saint who came almost\ntoo late to salvation but finally rejected the world, the flesh and\nthe devil. This is not the Pico who traveled to Rome a few years\nbefore to take on the whole world in a failed philosophical\nextravaganza; nor the Pico who bungled an attempt to carry off a\nmarried woman whose husband was named Medici\u2014no less; nor the\nPico with whom Ficino bantered about his missteps and misfortunes in\nletters loaded with astro-mythological allusions. It may be that the\ndisasters of 1486\u20137 chastened the young nobleman enough to\nexplain the muffling of Kabbalah in the Heptaplus and the\njarring recantation that we find in the Disputations. But\nsince the editor of the Disputations, Gianfrancesco Pico,\nalso edited the letters that he selected to underwrite a tendentious\nLife of his uncle, and since Gianfrancesco himself was not\njust a devout fideist but also a prodigiously productive scholar and\nan original thinker, we should not dismiss the possibility that the\nDisputations ought to be read more as a pendant to the\nnephew\u2019s Life of Pico than as proof of penitence in a\nfinal phase of his uncle\u2019s meteoric career.\n",
