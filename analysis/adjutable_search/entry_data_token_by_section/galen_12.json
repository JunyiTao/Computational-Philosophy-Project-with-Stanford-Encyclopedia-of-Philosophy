Physical Theory and Biological Concepts\nWe have already considered Galen\u2019s physical analysis in the broader context of his causal theory, as well as in relation to his notions of demonstration. This section will give more detail on that physical theory, considering further aspects of Galen\u2019s account of change in the physical and biological world, as well as the relevance of the concepts of form and matter, of substance, and of powers.\n",
