The Values Underlying the Rule of Law\n\nEven if the principles of the Rule of Law are purely formal in their\napplication, we don\u2019t just value them for formalistic reasons.\nMost fundamentally, people value the Rule of Law because it takes some\nof the edge off the power that is necessarily exercised over them in a\npolitical community. In various ways, being ruled through law, means\nthat power is less arbitrary, more predictable, more impersonal, less\nperemptory, less coercive even. It establishes what Fuller (1964:\n39\u201340) called a bond of reciprocity\u2014a mutuality of\nconstraint\u2014between the ruler and the ruled, and in that sense it\nmitigates the asymmetry that political power otherwise involves.\n\nConnected with this, the Rule of Law is valuable and important because\nit establishes an environment that is conducive to liberty. According\nto Hayek\u2019s theory of the Rule of Law\u2014particularly in the\nearly phase of his work (see\n section 3.5\n above)\u2014we value requirements like generality and impersonality\nbecause they free us from dependence upon others\u2019 wills:\n\n\nMy action can hardly be regarded as subject to the will of another\nperson if I use his rules for my own purposes as I might use my\nknowledge of a law of nature, and if that person does not know of my\nexistence or of the particular circumstances in which the rules will\napply to me or of the effects they will have on my plans. (Hayek 1960:\n152)\n\n\nHayek also maintained that requirements of clarity, prospectivity and\nso on make an important contribution to predictability, which he\nthought was indispensable for individual freedom. Predictability is\noften cited as a Rule-of-Law virtue. In his well-known recent book on\nthe subject, Tom Bingham indicated that one of the most important\nthings people needed from the law that governed them was\npredictability in the conduct of their lives and businesses. He quoted\nLord Mansfield to the effect that \n\n\n[i]n all mercantile transactions the great object should be certainty:\n\u2026 it is of more consequence that a rule should be certain, than\nwhether the rule is established one way rather than the other. (Lord\nMansfield in Vallejo v. Wheeler (1774) 1 Cowp. 143, p. 153\n(cited by Bingham 2010: 38)) \n\n\nBingham went on to observe in his own voice that \n\n\n[n]o one would choose to do business \u2026 involving large sums of\nmoney, in a country where parties\u2019 rights and obligations were\nundecided. (Bingham 2010: 38) \n\n\nThese conceptions claim to bring a certain air of reality to our\ndiscussions of freedom. There may be no getting away from legal\nconstraint in the circumstances of modern life, but freedom is\npossible nevertheless if people know in advance how the law will\noperate and how they have to act to avoid its application. Knowing in\nadvance how the law will operate enables one to make plans and work\naround its requirements (see Hayek 1960: 153 and 156\u20137). And\nknowing that one can count on the law\u2019s protecting property and\npersonal rights gives each citizen some certainty about what he can\nrely on in his dealings with other people. The Rule of Law is\nviolated, on this account, when the norms that are applied by\nofficials do not correspond to the norms that have been made public to\nthe citizens or when officials act on the basis of their own\ndiscretion rather than norms laid down in advance. If action of this\nsort becomes endemic, then not only are people\u2019s expectations\ndisappointed, but increasingly they will find themselves unable to\nform expectations on which to rely, and the horizons of their\nplanning and their economic activity will shrink accordingly.\n\nSo we need a basis for expectation. The best account of the importance\nof legal expectations was given by the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy\nBentham, in a work called \u201cPrinciples of the Civil Code\u201d.\nExpectation, said Bentham, is \u201ca chain which unites our present\nexistence to our future existence\u201d. \n\n\nIt is hence that we have the power of forming a general plan of\nconduct; it is hence that the successive instants which compose the\nduration of life are not isolated and independent points, but become\ncontinuous parts of a whole. (Bentham 1931 [1802, 1864]: 111) \n\nThe establishment of expectations, said Bentham, is largely the work\nof law, and the security of expectations is a vital constraint on the\naction of law: \u201cThe principle of security \u2026 requires that\nevents, so far as they depend upon laws, should conform to the\nexpectations which law itself has created\u2026\u201d.\n\nJoseph Raz and Lon Fuller took the point about freedom even further.\nRaz (1979 [1977]: 221) suggested that securing an atmosphere conducive\nto freedom was a matter of dignity: \u201cRespecting human dignity\nentails treating humans as persons capable of planning and plotting\ntheir future\u201d (Raz 1979 [1977]: 221). In Lon Fuller\u2019s\ntheory, too, the principles of the inner morality of law were valued\nfor the way they respected dignity:\n\n\nTo embark on the enterprise of subjecting human conduct to rules\ninvolves \u2026 a commitment to the view that man is \u2026 a\nresponsible agent, capable of understanding and following\nrules\u2026. Every departure from the principles of law\u2019s\ninner morality is an affront to man\u2019s dignity as a responsible\nagent. To judge his actions by unpublished or retrospective laws, or\nto order him to do an act that is impossible, is to convey \u2026\nyour indifference to his powers of self-determination. (Fuller 1964:\n162)\n\n\nWhat is said here about the connection between dignity and\nFuller\u2019s formal principles can be said even more about the\nconnection between procedure and dignity. Procedural principles\ncapture a deep and important sense that law is a mode of governing\npeople that treats them as though they had a perspective of their own\nto present on the application of norms to their conduct and situation.\nApplying a norm to a human individual is not like deciding what to do\nabout a rabid animal or a dilapidated house. It involves paying\nattention to a point of view. As such it embodies a crucial\ndignitarian idea\u2014respecting the dignity of those to whom the\nnorms are applied as beings capable of explaining themselves.\n",
