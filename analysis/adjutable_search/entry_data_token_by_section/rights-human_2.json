    "main_text": "The Existence and Grounds of Human Rights || Political Conceptions of Human Rights\n2.3 Political Conceptions of Human Rights\n below). \n\nPolitical theorists would add to the four defining elements suggested\nabove some set of political roles or functions. This kind of view may\nbe plausible for the very salient international human rights\nthat have emerged in international law and politics in the last fifty\nyears. But human rights can exist and function in contexts not\ninvolving international scrutiny and intervention such as a world with\nonly one state. Imagine, for example, that an asteroid strike had\nkilled everyone in all countries except New Zealand, leaving it the\nonly state in existence. Surely the idea of human rights as well as\nmany dimensions of human rights practice could continue in New\nZealand, even though there would be no international relations, law,\nor politics (for an argument of this sort see Tasioulas 2012). And if\nin the same scenario a few people were discovered to have survived in\nIceland and were living without a government or state, New Zealanders\nwould know that human rights governed how these people should be\ntreated even though they were stateless. How deeply the idea of human\nrights must be rooted in international law and practice should not be\nsettled by definitional fiat. We can allow, however, that the sorts of\npolitical functions that Rawls and Beitz describe are\ntypically served by international human rights today. \n2. The Existence and Grounds of Human Rights\n2.1 How Can Human Rights Exist?\n\nA philosophical question about human rights that occurs to many people\nis how it is possible for such rights to exist. Several possible ways\nare explored in this section.\n\nThe most obvious way in which human rights come into existence is as\nnorms of national and international law that are created by enactment,\ncustom, and judicial decisions. At the international level, human\nrights norms exist because of treaties that have turned them into\ninternational law. For example, the human right not to be held in\nslavery or servitude in Article 4 of the\n European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\n (Council of Europe, 1950) and in Article 8 of the\n International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\n (UN 1966) exists because these treaties establish it. At the national\nlevel, human rights norms exist because they have through legislative\nenactment, judicial decision, or custom become part of a\ncountry\u2019s law. For example, the right against slavery exists in\nthe United States because the\n 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n prohibits slavery and servitude. When rights are embedded in\ninternational law we speak of them as human rights; but when they are\nenacted in national law we more frequently describe them as civil or\nconstitutional rights. \n\nEnactment in national and international law is clearly one of the ways\nin which human rights exist. But many have suggested that this cannot\nbe the only way. If human rights exist only because of enactment,\ntheir availability is contingent on domestic and international\npolitical developments. Many people have looked for a way to support\nthe idea that human rights have roots that are deeper and less subject\nto human decisions than legal enactment. One version of this idea is\nthat people are born with rights, that human rights are somehow innate\nor inherent in human beings (see Morsink 2009). One way that a\nnormative status could be inherent in humans is by being God-given.\nThe\n U.S. Declaration of Independence\n (1776) claims that people are \u201cendowed by their Creator\u201d\nwith natural rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. On\nthis view, God, the supreme lawmaker, enacted some basic human\nrights.\n\nRights plausibly attributed to divine decree must be very general and\nabstract (life, liberty, etc.) so that they can apply to thousands of\nyears of human history, not just to recent centuries. But contemporary\nhuman rights are specific and many of them presuppose contemporary\ninstitutions (e.g., the right to a fair trial and the right to\neducation). Even if people are born with God-given natural rights, we\nneed to explain how to get from those general and abstract rights to\nthe specific rights found in contemporary declarations and\ntreaties.\n\nAttributing human rights to God\u2019s commands may give them a\nsecure status at the metaphysical level, but in a very diverse world\nit does not make them practically secure. Billions of people do not\nbelieve in the God of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. If people do\nnot believe in God, or in the sort of god that prescribes rights, and\nif you want to base human rights on theological beliefs you must\npersuade these people of a rights-supporting theological view. This is\nlikely to be even harder than persuading them of human rights. Legal\nenactment at the national and international levels provides a far more\nsecure status for practical purposes.\n\nHuman rights could also exist independently of legal enactment by\nbeing part of actual human moralities. All human groups seem to have\nmoralities in the sense of imperative norms of interpersonal behavior\nbacked by reasons and values. These moralities contain specific norms\n(for example, a prohibition of the intentional murder of an innocent\nperson) and specific values (for example, valuing human life.) If\nalmost all human groups have moralities containing norms prohibiting\nmurder, these norms could partially constitute the human right to\nlife.\n\nThe view that human rights are norms found in all human moralities is\nattractive but has serious difficulties. Although worldwide acceptance\nof human rights has been increasing rapidly in recent decades (see\n 4. Universal Human Rights in a World of Diverse Beliefs and Practices),\n worldwide moral unanimity about human rights does not exist. Human\nrights declarations and treaties are intended to change existing\nnorms, not just describe the existing moral consensus. \n\nYet another way of explaining the existence of human rights is to say\nthat they exist most basically in true or justified ethical outlooks.\nOn this account, to say that there is a human right against torture is\nmainly to assert that there are strong reasons for believing that it\nis always morally wrong to engage in torture and that protections\nshould be provided against it. This approach would view the Universal\nDeclaration as attempting to formulate a justified political morality\nfor the whole planet. It was not merely trying to identify a\npreexisting moral consensus; it was rather trying to create a\nconsensus that could be supported by very plausible moral and\npractical reasons. This approach requires commitment to the\nobjectivity of such reasons. It holds that just as there are reliable\nways of finding out how the physical world works, or what makes\nbuildings sturdy and durable, there are ways of finding out what\nindividuals may justifiably demand of each other and of governments.\nEven if unanimity about human rights is currently lacking, rational\nagreement is available to humans if they will commit themselves to\nopen-minded and serious moral and political inquiry. If moral reasons\nexist independently of human construction, they can\u2014when\ncombined with true premises about current institutions, problems, and\nresources\u2014generate moral norms different from those currently\naccepted or enacted. The Universal Declaration seems to proceed on\nexactly this assumption (see Morsink 2009). One problem with this view\nis that existence as good reasons seems a rather thin form of\nexistence for human rights. But perhaps we can view this thinness as a\npractical rather than a theoretical problem, as something to be\nremedied by the formulation and enactment of legal norms. The best\nform of existence for human rights would combine robust legal\nexistence with the sort of moral existence that comes from widespread\nacceptance based on strong moral and practical reasons.\n2.2 Normative Justifications for Human Rights\n\nJustifications for human rights should defend their main features\nincluding their character as rights, their universality, and their\nhigh priority. Such justifications should also be capable of providing\nstarting points for justifying a plausible list of specific rights (on\nstarting points and making the transition to specific rights see\nNickel 2007; see also\n Section 3 Which Rights are Human Rights?\n below). Further, justifying international human rights is\nlikely to require additional steps (Buchanan 2012). These requirements\nmake the construction of a good justification for human rights a\ndaunting task.\n\nApproaches to justification include grounding human rights in\nprudential reasons, practical reasons, moral rights (Thomson 1990),\nhuman well-being (Sumner 1987, Talbott 2010), fundamental interests\n(Beitz 2015), human needs (Miller 2012), agency and autonomy (Gewirth\n1996, Griffin 2008) dignity (Gilabert 2018, Kateb 2011, Tasioulas\n2015), fairness (Nickel 2007), equality, and positive freedom (Gould\n2004, Nussbaum 2000, Sen 2004). Justifications can be based on just\none of these types of reasons or they can be eclectic and appeal to\nseveral (Tasioulas. 2015).\n\nGrounding human rights in human agency and autonomy has had strong\nadvocates in recent decades. For example, in Human Rights: Essays\non Justification and Application (1982) Alan Gewirth offered an\nagency-based justification for human rights. He argued that denying\nthe value of successful agency and action is not an option for a human\nbeing; having a life requires regarding the indispensable conditions\nof agency and action as necessary goods. Abstractly described, these\nconditions of successful agency are freedom and well-being. A prudent\nrational agent who must have freedom and well-being will assert a\n\u201cprudential right claim\u201d to them. Having demanded that\nothers respect her freedom and well-being, consistency requires her to\nrecognize and respect the freedom and well-being of other persons.\nSince all other agents are in exactly the same position as she is of\nneeding freedom and well-being, consistency requires her to recognize\nand respect their claims to freedom and well-being. She\n\u201clogically must accept\u201d that other people as agents have\nequal rights to freedom and well-being. These two abstract rights work\nalone and together to generate equal specific human rights of familiar\nsorts (Gewirth 1978, 1982, 1996). Gewirth\u2019s aspiration was to\nprovide an argument for human rights that applies to all human agents\nand that is inescapable. From a few hard-to-dispute facts and a\nprinciple of consistency he thinks we can derive two generic human\nrights\u2014and from them, a list of more determinate rights.\nGewirth\u2019s views have generated a large critical literature (see\nBeyleveld 1991, Boylan 1999).\n\nA more recent attempt to base human rights on agency and autonomy is\nfound in James Griffin\u2019s book, On Human Rights (2008).\nGriffin does not share Gewirth\u2019s goal of providing a logically\ninescapable argument for human rights, but his overall view shares key\nstructural features with Gewirth\u2019s. These include starting the\njustification with the unique value of human agency and autonomy\n(which Griffin calls \u201cnormative agency\u201d), postulating some\nabstract rights (autonomy, freedom, and well-being), and making a\nplace for a right to well-being within an agency-based approach.\n\nIn the current dispute between \u201cmoral\u201d (or\n\u201corthodox\u201d) and \u201cpolitical\u201d conceptions of\nhuman rights, Griffin strongly sides with those who see human rights\nas fundamentally moral rights. Their defining role, in Griffin\u2019s\nview, is protecting people\u2019s ability to form and pursue\nconceptions of a worthwhile life\u2014a capacity that Griffin\nvariously refers to as \u201cautonomy,\u201d \u201cnormative\nagency,\u201d and \u201cpersonhood.\u201d This ability to form,\nrevise, and pursue conceptions of a worthwhile life is taken to be of\nparamount value, the exclusive source of human dignity, and thereby\nthe basis of human rights (Griffin 2008). Griffin holds that people\nvalue this capacity \u201cespecially highly, often more highly than\neven their happiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cPracticalities\u201d also shape human rights in\nGriffin\u2019s view. He describes practicalities as \u201ca second\nground\u201d of human rights. They prescribe making the boundaries of\nrights clear by avoiding \u201ctoo many complicated bends,\u201d\nenlarging rights a little to give them safety margins, and consulting\nfacts about human nature and the nature of society. Accordingly, the\njustifying generic function that Griffin assigns to human rights is\nprotecting normative agency while taking account of\npracticalities.\n\nGriffin claims that human rights suffer even more than other normative\nconcepts from an \u201cindeterminacy of sense\u201d that makes them\nvulnerable to proliferation (Griffin 2008). He thinks that tying all\nhuman rights to the single value of normative agency while taking\naccount of practicalities is the best way to remedy this malady. He\ncriticizes the frequent invention of new human rights and the\n\u201cballooning of the content\u201d of established rights. Still,\nGriffin is friendly towards most of the rights in the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Beyond this, Griffin takes human rights\nto include many rights in interpersonal morality. For example, Griffin\nthinks that a child\u2019s human right to education applies not just\nagainst governments but also against the child\u2019s parents.\n\nGriffin\u2019s thesis that all human rights are grounded in normative\nagency is put forward not so much as a description but as a proposal,\nas the best way of giving human rights unity, coherence, and limits.\nUnfortunately, accepting and following this proposal is unlikely to\nyield effective barriers to proliferation or a sharp line between\nhuman rights and other moral norms. The main reason is one that\nGriffin himself recognizes: the \u201cgenerative capacities\u201d of\nnormative agency are \u201cquite great.\u201d Providing adequate\nprotections of the three components of normative agency (autonomy,\nfreedom, and minimal well-being) will encounter a lot of threats to\nthese values and hence will require lots of rights. \n2.3 Political Conceptions of Human Rights\n\nViews that explain human rights in terms of the practical political\nroles that they play have had prominent advocates in recent decades.\nThese \u201cpolitical\u201d conceptions of human rights explain what\nhuman rights are by describing the things that they\ndo. Two philosophers who have developed political conceptions\nare discussed in this section, namely, John Rawls and Charles Beitz\n(for helpful discussions of political conceptions and their\nalternatives see the collections of essays in Etinson 2018 and Maliks\nand Schaffer 2017). \n\nAdvocates of political conceptions of human rights are often agnostic\nor skeptical about universal moral rights while rejecting\nwholesale moral skepticism and thinking possible the provision of\nsound normative justifications for the content, normativity, and roles\nof human rights (for challenges to purely political views see Gilabert\n2011, Liao and Etinson 2012, Sangiovanni 2017, and Waldron 2018).\n\nJohn Rawls introduced the idea of a political conception of human\nrights in his book,  The Law of Peoples (Rawls 1999). The\nbasic idea is that we can understand what human rights are and what\ntheir justification requires by identifying the main roles they play\nin some political sphere. In The Law of Peoples this sphere\nis international relations (and, secondarily, national politics).\nRawls was attempting a normative reconstruction of international law\nand politics within today\u2019s international system, and this helps\nexplain Rawls\u2019s focus on how human rights function within this\nsystem.\n\nRawls says that human rights are a special class of urgent\nrights. He seems to accept the definition of human rights given\nin Section 1 above. Besides saying that human rights are rights that\nare high priority or \u201curgent,\u201d Rawls also accepts that\nthey are plural and universal. But Rawls was working on a narrower\nproject than Gewirth and Griffin. The international human\nrights he was concerned with are also defined by their roles in\nhelping define in various ways the normative structure of the global\nsystem. They provide content to other normative concepts such as\nlegitimacy, sovereignty, permissible intervention, and membership in\ngood standing in the international community.\n\nAccording to Rawls the justificatory process for human rights is\nanalogous to the one for principles of justice at the national level\nthat he described in A Theory of Justice (Rawls 1971).\nInstead of asking about the terms of cooperation that free and equal\ncitizens would agree to under fair conditions, we ask about the terms\nof cooperation that free and equal peoples or countries would\nagree to under fair conditions. We imagine representatives of the\nworld\u2019s countries meeting to choose the normative principles\nthat constitute the basic international structure. These\nrepresentatives are imagined to see the countries they represent as\nfree (rightfully independent) and equal (equally worthy of respect and\nfair treatment). These representatives are also imagined to be\nchoosing rationally in light of the fundamental interests of their\ncountry, to be reasonable in seeking to find and respect fair terms of\ncooperation, and impartial because they are behind a \u201cveil of\nignorance\u201d\u2014they lack information about the country they\nrepresent such as its size, wealth, and power. Rawls holds that under\nthese conditions these representatives will unanimously choose\nprinciples for the global order that include some basic human rights\n(for further explanation of the global original position see the\nentries on\n John Rawls\n and\n original position).\n\nRawls advocated a limited list of human rights, one that leaves out\nmany fundamental freedoms, rights of political participation, and\nequality rights. He did this for two reasons. One is that he wanted a\nlist that is plausible for all reasonable countries, not just liberal\ndemocracies. The second reason is that he viewed serious violations of\nhuman rights as triggering permissible intervention by other\ncountries, and only the most important rights can play this role.\n\nLeaving out protections for equality and democracy is a high price to\npay for assigning human rights the role of making international\nintervention permissible when they are seriously violated. We can\naccommodate Rawls\u2019underlying idea without paying that price. To\naccept the idea that countries engaging in massive violations of the\nmost important human rights are not to be tolerated we do not need to\nfollow Rawls in equating international human rights with a\nheavily-pruned list. Instead we can work up a view\u2014which is\nneeded for other purposes anyway\u2014of which human rights are the\nweightiest and then assign the intervention-permitting role to this\nsubset.\n\nCharles Beitz\u2019s account of human rights in The Idea of Human\nRights (Beitz 2009) shares many similarities with Rawls\u2019s\nbut is much more fully developed. Like Rawls, Beitz deals with human\nrights only as they have developed in contemporary international human\nrights practice. Beitz suggests that we can develop an understanding\nof human rights by attending to \u201cthe practical inferences that\nwould be drawn by competent participants in the practice from what\nthey regard as valid claims of human rights.\u201d Observations of\nwhat competent participants say and do inform the account of what\nhuman rights are. The focus is not on what human rights are at some\ndeep philosophical level; it is rather on how they work by guiding\nactions within a recently emerged and still evolving discursive\npractice. The norms of the practice guide the interpretation and\napplication of human rights, the appropriateness of criticism in terms\nof human rights, adjudication in human rights courts,\nand\u2014perhaps most importantly\u2014responding to serious\nviolations of human rights. Beitz says that human rights are\n\u201cmatters of international concern\u201d and that they are\n\u201cpotential triggers of transnational protective and remedial\naction.\u201d\n\nBeitz does not agree with Rawls\u2019s view that these roles require\nan abbreviated list of human rights. He accepts that the requirements\nof human rights are weaker than the requirements of social justice at\nthe national level, but denies that human rights are minimal or highly\nmodest in other respects.\n\nBeitz rightly suggests that a reasonable person can accept and use the\nidea of human rights without accepting any particular view about their\nfoundations. It is less clear that he is right in suggesting that good\njustifications of human rights should avoid as far as possible\ncontroversial assumptions about religion, metaphysics, ideology, and\nintrinsic value (see the entry\n public reason).\n Beitz emphasizes the practical good that human rights do, not their\ngrounds in some underlying moral reality. This helps make human rights\nattractive to people from around the world with their diverse\nreligious and philosophical traditions. The broad justification for\nhuman rights and their normativity that Beitz offers is that they\nprotect \u201curgent individual interests against predictable dangers\n(\u201dstandard threats\u201c) to which they are vulnerable under\ntypical circumstances of life in a modern world order composed of\nindependent states.\u201d\n",
