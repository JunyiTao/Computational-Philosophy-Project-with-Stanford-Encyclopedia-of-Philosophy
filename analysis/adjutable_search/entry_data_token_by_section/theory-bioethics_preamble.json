    "main_text": "\n\nThe relation between bioethics and moral theory is a complicated one.\nTo start, we have philosophers as major contributors to the field of\nbioethics, and to many philosophers, their discipline is almost by\ndefinition a theoretical one. So when asked to consider the role of\nmoral theorizing in bioethics, a natural position of such philosophers\nis that moral theory has a crucial, if not indispensable, role.\nAt the same time, there are those who call into question the\n\u201capplied ethics\u201d model of bioethics. Roughly, on this\nmodel, one moral theory or other (e.g., utilitarianism, Kantian\ndeontology, virtue theory) is imposed upon the applied ethics problem\nat hand, in the hopes of producing a resolution. Such a model,\naccording to its detractors, overplays the separation of the\ntheoretical from the applied. Still further, there are those such as\nWill Kymlicka (1993 [1996]) who hold that moral theory should not have\na place in the making of public policy on bioethical\n issues.[1]\n\nThis entry starts by addressing the complexities surrounding the very\nnotions of bioethics and moral theory. From there, we explore the\nquestion of what doing applied ethics amounts to. Moving on, the\ndiscussion centers upon the main methodological movements in\nbioethics\u2019 relatively short history: its appeal to high moral\ntheory, the emergence of mid-level approaches to bioethics, and\napproaches to bioethics that attribute a lesser role to theoretical\ntools, or no role at all. Feminist approaches to bioethics are treated\nnext, followed by a look at the significance of moral theory to\nclinical bioethics.\n",
