    "main_text": "Africana Philosophy: Contributions\n13. Future Developments\n\n\nThe possible futures of developments in Africana philosophy in\nAfrican and the African Diaspora are open. The initial work of making\nthe case for and legitimacy of African American, African, and Africana\nphilosophy and its subfields has been accomplished with significant\nsuccess even without universal acceptance and respect. That is to be\nexpected, for no intellectual movement or disciplinary sub-field ever\nwins acceptance by all. Still, there is more to be done by way of\nconsolidating the gains while forging new developments as minds are\nturned to challenging issues, many of them novel. To note, for two\ndecades much of the effort of practitioners of Africana philosophy has\nbeen devoted to explorations of race, a foundational and\npervasive complex of forceful factors shaping virtually all aspects and\ndimensions of life in the formation of Modernity in Europe and the\nAmericas, and in every instance in which Europeans encroached on the\nlands and lives of peoples around the globe. Achieving justice without\nracism in polities bequeathed by Modernity is hardly finished business.\nSo, the need to rethink race will be with us for a while\nyet.\n\n\nHowever, the need will be generated by resolutions of old\ndifficulties and challenges. Success will bring new challenges. Among\nthese, settling such questions as whether there can and should be\nnorms, practices, and agendas that are definitive of philosophizing\nidentified as instances of \u201cAfricana\u201d philosophy. If so,\nthen on what terms, and to what ends, are the requisite agendas, norms,\nand practices to be set to serve the best interests of African and\nAfrican-descended peoples, without injustice to non-Black peoples, and\nthereby provide those philosophizing with normative guidance while\nconforming to norms that ensure propriety and truthfulness in\ndiscursive practices on conditions of warrant that are open to and can\nbe confirmed by persons who are neither African nor African-descended?\nShould such concerns continue to be appropriate conditioners of\nphilosophical effort? The praxes and supportive discursive communities\nconstitutive of Africana philosophy will have to meet certain\ninstitutionalized rules governing scholarly practices even as those of\nus committed to the development of the enterprise contribute to\ncritiques and refinements of these institutionalized rules while\ndevising and proposing others.\n\n\nThe work constituting Africana philosophy, on the African continent\nand throughout the African Diaspora, has helped to change the agendas\nand rules of discourse and praxis in Philosophy and other disciplines\nand discursive communities in contemporary academic institutions and\norganizations. The enterprise has been a significant contributor to the\nemergent recognition of the need to give greater respectful attention\nto raciality and ethnicity (as well as to gender, sexual orientation,\nand other constitutive aspects of our personal and social identities)\nas conditioners of philosophical praxis without thereby invalidating\nreconstructed notions of proper reasoning. As well, practitioners of\nAfricana philosophy have aided the development of much wider and deeper\nrecognition and acknowledgment of inadequacies in basic notions and\nagendas in the legacies of Western Philosophy thereby helping to open\nus all to challenging new needs and possibilities for further revising\nphilosophical traditions and practices. The expansion of academic\nPhilosophy to include Africana philosophy is indicative of efforts to\nachieve greater intellectual democracy in multi-ethnic, multi-racial\nsocieties. These developments should be continued, aided by\nphilosophizing persons who are neither African nor of African descent,\nnor, even, professional academic philosophers, and continued as part of\na larger, ongoing effort to appreciate and learn from the many\nlife-enriching creations of all peoples as contributions to\nthe treasure-houses of human civilization.\n",
