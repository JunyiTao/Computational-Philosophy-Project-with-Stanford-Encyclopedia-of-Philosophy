    "main_text": "The Classical Era || Zhuangzi: Rejecting Governance\n2.5 Zhuangzi: Rejecting Governance\n\nUnlike the Dao De Jing, with which it is often lumped as\nfellow \u201cDaoist\u201d texts, it is difficult to read the\nZhuangzi as concerned with governance or aimed at rulers.\nThis is not to say that the text advocates anarchism; like all texts\nfrom the Warring States, it seems to take for granted that states will\nhave rulers. To a greater extent than any other text, though, it is\nuninterested in the problems rulers faced and even seems disinclined\nto grant rulers any special authority. It is certainly at odds with\nthose thinkers who believe that people must come to identify with\ntheir states. One gloss for the attitude of the text towards\ngovernance issues, in fact, might be: avoid commitment, accept what\ncomes.\n\nAt the heart of the text is a radical linguistic and epistemological\nargument against accepting any one perspective as ultimately,\neternally correct. \u201cClarity (ming)\u201d comes when\none realizes the perspectival nature of all affirmations and denials.\nHaving attained this kind of clarity, it makes no sense to put oneself\non the line for any one set of evaluations, like \u201cour state must\ntriumph\u201d or even \u201cit is better for humans to flourish than\nplants\u201d. In the context of the harsh realities of the Warring\nStates, these doctrines may well have appealed to many.\n",
