    "main_text": "Dynamic Epistemic Paradoxes || Dogmatism paradox: A puzzle about losing knowledge\n6.2 Dogmatism paradox: A puzzle about losing knowledge\n\nSaul Kripke\u2019s ruminations on the surprise test paradox led him\nto a paradox about dogmatism. He lectured on both paradoxes at\nCambridge University to the Moral Sciences Club in 1972. (A descendent\nof this lecture now appears as Kripke 2011.) Gilbert Harman transmitted\nKripke\u2019s new paradox as follows:\n\nIf I know that \\(h\\) is true, I know that any evidence\nagainst \\(h\\) is evidence against something that is\ntrue; I know that such evidence is misleading. But I should disregard\nevidence that I know is misleading. So, once I know that \\(h\\)\nis true, I am in a position to disregard any future\nevidence that seems to tell against \\(h\\). (1973, 148)\n\n\nDogmatists accept this reasoning. For them, knowledge closes inquiry.\nAny \u201cevidence\u201d that conflicts with what is known can be\ndismissed as misleading evidence. Forewarned is forearmed.\n\nThis conservativeness crosses the line from confidence to\nintransigence. To illustrate the excessive inflexibility, here is a\nchain argument for the dogmatic conclusion that my reliable colleague\nDoug has given me a misleading report (corrected from Sorensen\n1988b):\n\n(C\\(_1\\))\nMy car is in the parking lot.\n(C\\(_2\\))\n If my car is in the parking lot and Doug provides evidence that\nmy car is not in the parking lot, then Doug\u2019s evidence is\nmisleading.\n(C\\(_3\\))\n If Doug reports he saw a car just like mine towed from the\nparking lot, then his report is misleading evidence.\n(C\\(_4\\))\n Doug reports that a car just like mine was towed from the parking\nlot.\n(C\\(_5\\))\n Doug\u2019s report is misleading evidence.\n\n\nBy hypothesis, I am justified in believing (C\\(_1)\\). Premise\n(C\\(_2)\\) is a certainty because it is analytically true. The argument\nfrom (C\\(_1)\\) and (C\\(_2)\\) to (C\\(_3)\\) is valid. Therefore, my\ndegree of confidence in (C\\(_3)\\) must equal my degree of confidence\nin (C\\(_1)\\). Since we are also assuming that I gain sufficient\njustification for (C\\(_4)\\), it seems to follow that I am justified in\nbelieving (C\\(_5)\\) by modus ponens. Similar arguments will lead me to\ndismiss further evidence such as a phone call from the towing service\nand my failure to see my car when I confidently stride over to the\nparking lot.\n\nGilbert Harman diagnoses the paradox as follows:\n\nThe argument for paradox overlooks the way actually having evidence\ncan make a difference. Since I now know [my car is in the parking\nlot], I now know that any evidence that appears to indicate something\nelse is misleading. That does not warrant me in simply disregarding\nany further evidence, since getting that further evidence can change\nwhat I know. In particular, after I get such further evidence I may no\nlonger know that it is misleading. For having the new evidence can\nmake it true that I no longer know that new evidence is misleading.\n(1973, 149)\n\n\nIn effect, Harman denies the hardiness of knowledge. The hardiness\nprinciple states that one knows only if there is no evidence such that\nif one knew about the evidence one would not be justified in believing\none\u2019s conclusion.\n\nHarman\u2019s conclusion that new knowledge can undermine old\nknowledge can be applied to the surprise test paradox: The students\nlose knowledge of the test announcement even though they do not forget\nthe announcement or do anything else incompatible with their\ncredentials as ideal reasoners. A student on Thursday is better\ninformed about the outcomes of test days than he was on Sunday. He\nknows the test was not on Monday and not on Wednesday. But he can only\npredict that the test is on Friday if he continues to know the\nannouncement. The extra knowledge of the testless days undermines\nknowledge of the announcement.\n\nMost epistemologists accepted Harman\u2019s appeal to defeaters. Some\nhave tried to make it more precise with details about updating\nindicative conditionals (Sorensen 1988b). This may vindicate and\ngeneralize Harman\u2019s prediction that the future evidence will\nchange your mind about what is misleading evidence. Knowledge of such\nconditionals is useless for a future modus ponens. The\ndogmatist correctly says we know the conditional \u201cIf I know\nthat \\(p\\), then any evidence conflicting with \\(p\\) is\nmisleading evidence\u201d. Indeed, it is a tautology! But the\ndogmatist fails to recognize this known tautology is useless\nknowledge. Acquiring the misleading evidence will make me stop knowing\np. If an auditor foresees being presented with a biased list of facts,\nhe may utter the tautology to his assistant to convey another\nproposition for which he has empirical support. That empirical\nproposition need not be useless knowledge. When the predicted list is\npresented, the forearmed auditor ignores the facts. But the basis is\nnot his a priori knowledge of the dogmatist\u2019s tautology.\n\nKripke notes that this solution will not stop the quick thinking\ndogmatist who takes measures to prevent his acquisition of the\nevidence that he now deems misleading (Kripke 2011, 43\u201344). A\nsecond worry is that the dogmatist can still ignore weak evidence. If\nI know a coin is fair then I know that if the first twenty tosses\ncomes out heads, then that is misleading evidence that the coin is not\nfair. Such a run does not defeat my knowledge claim. (Substitute a\nshorter run if you think it does defeat.) So Harman\u2019s solution does\nnot apply. Yet it is dogmatic to ignore this evidence. \n\nIn addition to this problem of weak dogmatism, Rachel Fraser (2022)\nadds a third problem of dogmatic bootstrapping. When Robert Millikan\nand Harvey Fletcher measured elementary electric charge with tiny\ncharged droplets, they discounted some of the drops as misleadingly\nwide of the plausible interval for the true value. Drops centrally located\nwithin the interval were \u201cbeauties\u201d. Editing out the\noutliers give Millikan a more precise measurement and a Nobel Prize in\n1923. In 1978, the physicist Gerald Holton went through the notebooks\nand was shocked by how much contrary data had gone unreported by\nMillikan. Fraser thinks there is a vicious circularity in data purification. \n\nBut the bootstrapping dogmatist will regard the circularity as virtuous. When the evidence is a mix of strong evidence and weak\ncounterevidence, the stronger body of evidence exposes the weaker body\nas misleading evidence. Think of a jigsaw puzzle that has been polluted with stray pieces from another puzzle. When you manage to get a complete fit with a subset of the pieces, the remaining pieces are removed from view. Dimming the misleading evidence allows the leading evidence to shine more visibly. Therefore, we can indeed be more confident than\nwe were before dismissing the weak evidence. Millikan was being\nresponsible gatekeeper rather than a wishful thinker. Just as data\nshould control theory, theory should control data.  The experimenter must strike a delicate balance between discounting too much contrary data and discounting too little. Proposed solutions to the dogmatism paradox have trouble sustaining this balance. \n\nI. J. Good (1967) demonstrated that gathering evidence maximizes\nexpected value given that the cost of the evidence is\nnegligible. Under this simplifying assumption, Good shows that\ndepartures from the principle of total evidence is at least imprudent.\nGiven epistemic utilitarianism, this practical irrationality becomes\ntheoretical irrationality. Bob Beddor (2019) now adds the premise that\nit is irrational to intend to do what one foresees to be irrational.\nFor instance, if you offered a million dollars to drink toxin tomorrow\nthat will make you ill for a day, you could profit from the offer\n(Kavka 1983). But if the million would be earned immediately upon you\nintending to drink the toxin, then you could not profit because you\nknow there would be no reason to follow through. By analogy, Beddor\nconcludes that it would be irrational to intend to avoid\ncounterevidence (Beddor 2019, 738). One is never entitled to discard\nevidence, even after it has been foreseen as misleading evidence.\n\nBut if the cost of evidence is significant, the connection between\npractical rationality and theoretical rationality favors\nignoring counterevidence. Judging that p embodies a resolution not to\ninquire further into the question of whether p is true. Or so answers\nthe volitionist (Fraser 2022).\n",
