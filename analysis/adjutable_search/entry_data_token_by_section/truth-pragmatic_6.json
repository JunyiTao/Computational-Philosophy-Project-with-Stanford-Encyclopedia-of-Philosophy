These\ntheories often disagree significantly with each other, making it\ndifficult either to define pragmatic theories of truth in a simple and\nstraightforward manner or to specify the necessary conditions that a\npragmatic theory of truth must meet. As a result, one way to clarify\nwhat makes a theory of truth pragmatic is to say something about what\npragmatic theories of truth are not. Given that pragmatic theories of\ntruth have often been put forward in contrast to prevailing\ncorrespondence and other \u201csubstantive\u201d theories of truth\n(Wyatt & Lynch, 2016), this suggests a common commitment shared by\nthe pragmatic theories described above.\n\nOne way to differentiate pragmatic accounts from other theories of\ntruth is to distinguish the several questions that have historically\nguided discussions of truth. While some have used decision trees to\ncategorize different theories of truth (Lynch 2001a; K\u00fcnne 2003),\nor have proposed family trees showing relations of influence and\naffinity (Haack 1978), another approach is to distinguish separate\n\u201cprojects\u201d that examine different dimensions of the\nconcept of truth (Kirkham 1992). (These projects also break into\ndistinct subprojects; for a similar approach see Frapolli 1996.) On\nthis last approach the first, \u201cmetaphysical\u201d, project aims\nto identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for \u201cwhat it\nis for a statement\u2026to be true\u201d (Kirkham 1992: 20; Wyatt\n& Lynch call this the \u201cessence project\u201d [2016: 324]).\nThis project often takes the form of identifying what makes a\nstatement true: e.g., correspondence to reality, or coherence with\nother beliefs, or the existence of a particular state of affairs. A\nsecond, \u201cjustification\u201d, project attempts to specify\n\u201csome characteristic, possessed by most true\nstatements\u2026by reference to which the probable truth or falsity\nof the statement can be judged\u201d (Kirkham 1992: 20). This often\ntakes the form of giving a criterion of truth that can be used to\ndetermine whether a given statement is true. Finally, the\n\u201cspeech-act\u201d project addresses the question of \u201cwhat\nare we doing when we make utterances\u201d that\n\u201cascribe truth to some statement?\u201d (Kirkham 1992: 28).\nUnfortunately, truth-theorists have not always been clear on which\nproject they are pursuing, which can lead to confusion about what\ncounts as a successful or complete theory of truth. It can also lead\nto truth-theorists talking past each other when they are pursuing\ndistinct projects with different standards and criteria of\nsuccess.\n\nIn these terms, pragmatic theories of truth are best viewed as\npursuing the speech-act and justification projects. As noted above,\npragmatic accounts of truth have often focused on how the concept of\ntruth is used and what speakers are doing when describing statements\nas true: depending on the version, speakers may be commending a\nstatement, signaling its scientific reliability, or committing\nthemselves to giving reasons in its support. Likewise, pragmatic\ntheories often focus on the criteria by which truth can be judged:\nagain, depending on the version, this may involve linking truth to\nverifiability, assertibility, usefulness, or long-term durability.\nWith regard to the speech-act and justification projects pragmatic\ntheories of truth seem to be on solid ground, offering plausible\nproposals for addressing these projects. They are on much less solid\nground when viewed as addressing the metaphysical project (Capps\n2020). As we will see, it is difficult to defend the idea, for\nexample, that either utility, verifiability, or widespread acceptance\nare necessary and sufficient conditions for truth or are what make a\nstatement true (though, to be clear, few pragmatists have defended\ntheir positions in these exact terms).\n\nThis would suggest that the opposition between pragmatic and\ncorrespondence theories of truth is partly a result of their pursuing\ndifferent projects. From a pragmatic perspective, the problem with the\ncorrespondence theory is its pursuit of the metaphysical project that,\nas its name suggests, invites metaphysical speculation about the\nconditions which make sentences true\u2014speculation that can\ndistract from more central questions of what makes true beliefs\nvaluable, how the truth predicate is used, and how true beliefs\nare best recognized and acquired. (Pragmatic theories of truth are not\nalone in raising these concerns (David 2022).) From the standpoint of\ncorrespondence theories and other accounts that pursue the\nmetaphysical project, pragmatic theories will likely seem incomplete,\nsidestepping the most important questions (Howat 2014). But from the\nstandpoint of pragmatic theories, projects that pursue or prioritize\nthe metaphysical project are deeply misguided and misleading.\n\nThis supports the following truism: a common feature of pragmatic\ntheories of truth is that they focus on the practical function that\nthe concept of truth plays. Thus, whether truth is a norm of inquiry\n(Misak), a way of signaling widespread acceptance (Rorty), stands for\nfuture dependability (Peirce), or designates the product of a process\nof inquiry (Dewey), among other things, pragmatic theories shed light\non the concept of truth by examining the practices through which\nsolutions to problems are framed, tested, asserted, and\ndefended\u2014and, ultimately, come to be called true. Pragmatic\ntheories of truth can thus be viewed as making contributions to the\nspeech-act and justification projects by focusing especially on the\npractices people engage in when they solve problems, make assertions,\nand conduct scientific inquiry. (For another example, Chang has argued\nthat claims are true \u201cto the extent that there are operationally\ncoherent activities that can be performed by relying on it\u201d (2022:\n167).) Of course, even though pragmatic theories of truth largely\nagree on which questions to address and in what order, this does not\nmean that they agree on the answers to these questions, or on how to\nbest formulate the meaning and function of truth.\n\nAnother common commitment of pragmatic theories of truth\u2014besides\nprioritizing the speech-act and justification projects\u2014is that\nthey do not restrict truth to certain topics or types of inquiry. That\nis, regardless of whether the topic is descriptive or normative,\nscientific or ethical, pragmatists tend to view it as an opportunity\nfor genuine inquiry that incorporates truth-apt assertions. The\ntruth-aptness of ethical and normative statements is a notable feature\nacross a range of pragmatic approaches, including Peirce\u2019s (at\nleast in some of his moods, e.g., 1901b [1958: 8.158]), Dewey\u2019s\ntheory of valuation (1939), Putnam\u2019s questioning of the\nfact-value dichotomy (2002), and Misak\u2019s claim that \u201cmoral\nbeliefs must be in principle responsive to evidence and\nargument\u201d (2000: 94; for a dissenting view see Frega 2013). This\nbroadly cognitivist attitude\u2014that normative statements are\ntruth-apt\u2014is related to how pragmatic theories of truth\nde-emphasize the metaphysical project. As a result, from a pragmatic\nstandpoint one of the problems with the correspondence theory of truth\nis that it can undermine the truth-aptness of normative claims. If, as\nthe correspondence theory proposes, a necessary condition for the\ntruth of a normative claim is the existence of a normative fact to\nwhich it corresponds, and if the existence of normative facts is\ndifficult to account for (normative facts seem ontologically distinct\nfrom garden-variety physical facts), then this does not bode well for\nthe truth-aptness of normative claims or the point of posing, and\ninquiring into, normative questions (Lynch 2009). If the\ncorrespondence theory of truth leads to skepticism about normative\ninquiry, then this is all the more reason, according to pragmatists,\nto sidestep the metaphysical project in favor of the speech-act and\njustification projects.\n\nAs we have seen, pragmatic theories of truth take a variety of\ndifferent forms. Despite these differences, and despite often being\naverse to being called a \u201ctheory\u201d, pragmatic theories of\ntruth do share some common features. To begin with, and unlike many\ntheories of truth, these theories focus on the pragmatics of\ntruth-talk: that is, they focus on how truth is used as an essential\nstep toward an adequate understanding of the concept of truth (indeed,\nthis comes close to being an oxymoron). More specifically, pragmatic\ntheories look to how truth is used in epistemic contexts where people\nmake assertions, conduct inquiries, solve problems, and act on their\nbeliefs. By prioritizing the speech-act and justification projects,\npragmatic theories of truth attempt to ground the concept of truth in\nepistemic practices as opposed to the abstract relations between\ntruth-bearers (such as propositions or statements) and truth-makers\n(such as states of affairs) appealed to by correspondence theories\n(MacBride 2022). Pragmatic theories also recognize that truth can play\na fundamental role in shaping inquiry and assertoric\ndiscourse\u2014for example, by functioning as a norm of these\npractices\u2014even when it is not explicitly mentioned. In this\nrespect pragmatic theories are less austere than deflationary theories\nwhich limit the use of truth to its generalizing and disquotational\nroles. And, finally, pragmatic theories of truth draw no limits, at\nleast at the outset, to the types of statements, topics, and inquiries\nwhere truth may play a practical role. If it turns out that a given\ntopic is not truth-apt, this is something that should be discovered as\na characteristic of that subject matter, not something determined by\nhaving chosen one theory of truth or another (Capps 2017).\n",
