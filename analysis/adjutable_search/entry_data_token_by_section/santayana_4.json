    "main_text": "Naturalism\n5. Ethics, Politics, and the Spiritual Life\n\n\nSantayana\u2019s moral philosophy is based on his naturalism. Most\ncommentators classify Santayana as an extreme moral relativist who\nmaintains that all individual moral perspectives have equal standing\nand are based on the heritable traits and environmental circumstances\nof individuals. This naturalistic approach applies to all living\norganisms. Nature does not establish a moral hierarchy of goods between\nanimal populations nor between individual animals. However, this same\nmoral relativism is also the basis for Santayana\u2019s claim that the good\nof individual animals is clear and is subject to naturalistic or\nbiological investigation.\n\n\nTwo tenets of his ethics are (1) the forms of the good are diverse,\nand (2) the good of each animal is definite and final. The moral\nterrain of animals, viewed from a neutral perspective, places all\nanimal interests and goods as equal. Each good stems from heritable\nphysical traits and is shaped by adaptations to the environment.\nConcluding that the \u201cforms of the good are divergent,\u201d\nSantayana holds that the good for each animal may differ, depending on\nthe nature of the psyche and the circumstances, and may be different\nfor an individual animal in different times and environments. There is\nno one good for all, or even for an individual.\n\n\nSeen as a whole, animal goods are not logically or morally ordered,\nthey are natural, morally neutral forces. But no living being can\nobserve all interests with such neutrality. Situated in a particular\nplace and time with heritable traits, all living beings have interests\noriginating from their physiology and physical environment. For\nSantayana, one may reasonably note that a neutral observer could view\nall moral perspectives as equal, but such a view must be balanced by\nthe understanding that no animal stands on neutral ground. There is a\npolarity between the ideal neutral, objective understanding of behavior\non the one hand and the committed and vested interest of particular\nliving beings on the other hand. One may recognize that every animal\ngood has its own standing, and one may respect that ideal, but \u201cthe\nright of alien natures to pursue their proper aims can never abolish\nour right to pursue ours\u201d (Persons and Places, 179).\n\n\nSantayana\u2019s second moral insight is that for each animal the good is\ndefinite and final. There are specific goods for each animal depending\non the specific heritable traits and interests of the psyche and on the\nspecific circumstances of the environment. Self-knowledge, then, is the\ndistinguishing moral mark. The extent to which one knows one\u2019s\ninterests, their complexity and centrality, will determine whether one\ncan achieve a good life, provided the environment is accommodating.\nSantayana\u2019s philosophy rests on his naturalism and on his humane and\nsympathetic appreciation for the excellence of each life. But from the\nperspective of autobiography, Santayana\u2019s clear notion of\nself-knowledge, in the sense of the Greeks, is his most distinguishing\nmark. For Santayana, \u201cintegrity or self-definition is and remains first\nand fundamental in morals \u2026\u201d (Persons and Places\n170).\n\n\nSelf-knowledge requires a critical appreciation of one\u2019s culture and\nphysical inheritance, and the ability to shape one\u2019s life in streams of\nconflicting goods within oneself and within one\u2019s community. Although\nthis position is common to many considerations of political philosophy,\nSantayana\u2019s approach to politics was much more conservative than that\nnormally associated with the founders of American pragmatism, such as\nJames and Dewey.\n\n\nSantayana\u2019s political conservatism is founded on his naturalism and\nhis emphasis on self-realization and spirituality. He is concerned\nthat liberal democracy may not provide a consistent basis for\nindividual freedom and spirituality. The twin fears of private anarchy\nand public uniformity are the grounds for his criticisms of democracy,\nand his account of social justice focuses on the individual rather\nthan the society. Santayana\u2019s inattentiveness to social inequality is\nperhaps understandable in the context of his naturalism where the\nfinal cause is the \u201cauthority of things.\u201d His basic\ncontention that individual suffering is the worse feature of human\nlife, not social inequality, causes him to focus more on the natural\ndilemmas of the individual rather than on social action. Coupling this\nargument with the view that all institutions, including governments,\nare inextricably rooted in their culture and background perhaps makes\nit understandable that he would not readily see how particular views\nof social inequality could be transferred readily from one culture to\nanother. In addition, Santayana\u2019s European and particularly Spanish\nbackground influenced his attitudes toward social action. His repeated\n\u201cLatin\u201d perspective caused him to look with considerable\nsuspicion toward forcing Anglo-Saxon outlooks on other cultures. Yet,\nin individual matters he was remarkably forthcoming as when he\nprovided financial support to numerous friends, often of quite\ndifferent philosophical, literary, and political persuasions than his\nown.\n\n\nWithin the natural order every living entity stands on the same\nnatural ground bathing equally in the impartial light of nature. No one\ncan claim a central place above others. But each entity also has an\nembodied set of values, and the art of life is to structure one\u2019s\nenvironment in such a fashion as to best realize those embodied values,\ni.e., to place in harmony the natural forces of one\u2019s life and one\u2019s\nenvironment.\n\n\nAmerican democracy has an exacting challenge. Lacking the time to\nlive in the mind, Americans use quantity as a justification for lack of\nquality in their achievements. Quantity is potentially infinite and\nassures unrivaled busy-ness, but is it worth it? No, according to\nSantayana, if self-realization is the goal of individual life. Of\ncourse, circumstances make it difficult, perhaps impossible, for some\nindividuals to order their lives reasonably and attain the practical\nwisdom to achieve individual happiness. America\u2019s economic success\nwould appear to make this possible for many, but to succeed Americans\nmust abandon servility to mechanism and economics. What is needed is a\nlife made free by a recovery of the capacity to have a vision of the\ngood life (Persons and Places, xxxiv). According to Santayana,\nthe fanatic is a person who has lost sight of their goals and redoubled\ntheir efforts. To supplant this busy, blind, relentlessly quantitative\nexistence, we must regain sight of our goals. Individual life should be\nstructured in light of those goals.\n\n\nSantayana\u2019s focus is on the individual, and the role of the state is\nto protect and to enable the individual to flourish. The goal is not\nsomething far off to be worked toward. It is not a task to be\naccomplished and then supplanted by another task, as is often the case\nwith American enterprise does. Rather it is the celebration of life in its\nfestivities. It is Aristotle\u2019s practical wisdom: structuring individual\nlife as it is, living it joyfully, and assuring that one\u2019s commitments\nare conducive to the delights of the intellect and consistent with the\ndemands of the time and tradition. It is the exercise of one\u2019s free\nchoice, shaping one\u2019s life through material well-being, but doing so to\nappreciate the poetic, dramatic quality of our own existence. To rush\nthrough life and die without the joy of living, that is the tragedy of\nAmerican life.\n\n\nFor some, though perhaps not for many, the spiritual life will be an\norganizing good. The cultural background for the spiritual life is the\nreligious life, primarily as found within the Catholic Church and\ninformed by the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century\naccounts of Eastern religions. But Santayana is not interested in an\nhistorical or doctrinal explication of the elements of traditional\nreligion, rather the philosophical task is to discern the elements\ngiving rise to such traditional views, and, in his own case, to\nexplicate the aspects of these origins without the dogmatism of\ntraditional religious belief.\n\n\nIntroducing the concept of a spiritual life led some to see an\ninherent conflict between Santayana\u2019s life of reason and the spiritual\nlife. In a letter to Milton Karl Munitz (23 July 1939), Santayana\nexplains the different perspectives of the life of reason and the\nspiritual life:\n\n\nI admit gladly that religion (= the \u201cSpiritual life\u201d) is a\nnatural interest, to be collated within the life of reason with every\nother interest; but it is an interest in the ultimate, an adjustment\nto life, death, science, and politics; and though cultivated specially\nby certain minds at certain hours, it has no moral or natural claim to\npredominance. The races and ages in which it is absent will inevitably\nregard it as unnecessary and obstructive, because they tend to arrange\ntheir moral economy without religion at all. Those to whom religion is\nabsorbing (e.g., the Indians) will on the contrary think a moral\neconomy inferior in which no place and no influence is given to the\nmonition of ultimate facts. I think you would not find my two voices\ninharmonious (I agree that they are different in pitch) if you did not\nlive in America in the XXth century when the \u201cdominance of the\nforeground\u201d is so pronounced. The dominance of the distance or\nbackground would impose a different synthesis. (Works, v. 5,\nbook 6, 254)\n\n\nIf the spiritual life was considered a dominating or guiding influence\nin structuring one\u2019s life, the way Santayana views reason, then one\nwould be forced to choose between the life of reason and the life of\nthe spirit as a monk or a nun must choose between the life of the\nworld and that of the religious order. But for Santayana, no such\nconflict exists; spirituality is not choosing a way of living over an\nextended period of time. Indeed, any effort to choose such a life\nwould be short lived, since the spiritual life is a life of\nreceptivity to all that comes in the moment while suspending animal\ninterests.  Suspending one\u2019s specific natural interests, such as\neating or sleeping, for any extended period would be both detrimental\nand tragic.\n\n\nConsciousness essentially is only awareness, an attention to what is\ngiven, rather than being an instrument in reshaping the world.\nConsciousness, emerging late in the evolutionary pathway, is a\nflowering of happy circumstances that celebrates what is given, and\nwhen truly recognized, does only that. It is joyful, delighting in\nwhat is presented, and not troubled by where it leads or what it\nmeans.  This is not to restate Santayana\u2019s view poetically but rather\nto convey that Santayana characterizes consciousness, itself, as\npoetic rather than as a means to an action or as a way of implementing\nan action.  The more dower, moralistic, and evangelical aspects of\nreligion he saw as confused efforts to make religion a science, a\nsocial club, or a political movement. Spirit, or consciousness, is\nmomentary, fleeting, and depends on the physical forces of our bodies\nand environment in order to exist. Shaping one\u2019s life to enhance these\nspiritual, fleeting moments, extending them as long as is practical,\nis one of the delights of living for some people, but it is certainly\nnot a goal for all, nor should it be.\n",
