    "main_text": "\n\nThe government plays a significant role in providing goods such as\nnational defence, infrastructure, education, security, and fire and\nenvironmental protection almost everywhere. These goods are often\nreferred to as \u201cpublic goods\u201d. Public goods are of\nphilosophical interest because their provision is, to varying degrees,\nessential to the smooth functioning of society\u2014economically,\npolitically, and culturally\u2014and because of their close\nconnection to problems concerning the regulation of externalities and\nthe free-rider problem. Without infrastructure and their protection\ngoods cannot be exchanged, votes cannot be cast, and it would be\nharder to enjoy the fruits of cultural production. There is widespread\nagreement among political philosophers that some level of education is\nrequired for democracy to be effective. Due to their connection to\nexternalities and the free-rider problem, the provision of public\ngoods raises profound economic and ethical issues.\n\nAs we will see in Section 1, the economic definition of a public good\nhas little to do with whether these goods are provided by the public\nor by private enterprises but with certain abstract features that are\nshared by many different goods, only some of which are regularly\nproduced publicly. The abstract features economists use in their\ndefinition depend on technology, values and tastes, making boundaries\ncontested and shifting over time. Section 2 will introduce the notion\nof an externality, and in Section 3 the standard neoclassical welfare\neconomic analysis of public goods will be examined. Section 4 looks at\nthe private provision of public goods. Section 5 offers a review of\nrecent experimental work on public goods (which challenges the\nstandard analysis to some extent). Section 6, finally, discusses some\nethical arguments relevant to the provision of public goods.\n",
