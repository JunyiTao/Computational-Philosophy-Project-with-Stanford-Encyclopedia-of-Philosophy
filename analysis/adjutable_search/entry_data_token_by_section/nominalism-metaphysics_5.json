One can divide theories of propositions into those that take\nthem to be structured entities and those that take them to be\nunstructured entities. Each conception comprises a family of\ntheories.\n\n\nThe most popular conceptions of unstructured propositions are those\nthat take them to be either sets of possible worlds or functions from\npossible worlds to truth-values (Lewis 1986a, 53; Stalnaker 1987, 2).\nOn these theories a proposition is the set of possible worlds in which\nit is true, or a function that has the value True when it\ntakes as argument a world where the proposition is true and has the\nvalue False when it takes as argument a world where the\nproposition is false.\n\n\nBut sets are, prima facie, abstract objects. So it looks as\nif those who take propositions to be sets of possible worlds should\ncount as platonists about propositions. But some people, like Lewis\n(1986a, 83) and Maddy (1990, 59), believe that sets of spatiotemporally\nlocated members are spatiotemporally located where and when their\nmembers are, in which case sets of spatiotemporally located members are\n concrete.[16]\n But since it lacks any members, the empty set is not\nspatiotemporally located. And since there are necessarily false\npropositions, that is, propositions that are true in no possible world,\nit is plausible, on this conception of propositions, to identify these\npropositions with the empty set. So some propositions (at least one)\nseem to be abstract objects. And functions also seem to be abstract\nobjects. And the truth values True and False seem to\nbe abstract objects as well. So these accounts of propositions as sets\nof possible worlds or functions from possible worlds to truth values,\nif they are to be nominalistic accounts of propositions, require some\nconsistent and plausible nominalistic account of pure sets, functions\nand truth values as concrete objects.\n\n\nThere are other theories of propositions that take them to be\nunstructured entities. George Bealer has a conception of unstructured\npropositions according to which they are sui generis\nirreducible intensional entities. His propositions can exist even if\nthe objects they are about do not exist and they can be actual even if\nthe objects they are about are not actual (Bealer 2006, 232\u20134).\nSuch propositions are abstract objects.\n\n\nAmong conceptions of propositions as structured entities one can\ndistinguish, roughly, between Russellian and Fregean versions. Both the\nRussellian and the Fregean conceptions of propositions are\nfamilies of theories. In general Fregean theories will take a\nproposition to be a complex entity with a particular structure whose\nconstituents are senses. But senses are abstract objects. And\nif, as seems plausible, a complex entity whose constituents are\nabstract objects must be an abstract object itself (how could an object\nbe in space or time when its constituents exist neither in space nor\ntime?), then, on this account, propositions are abstract objects.\n\n\nAccording to the Russellian conception of propositions, a\nproposition is a complex entity with a particular structure whose\nconstituents are particulars and/or properties and/or \n relations.[17]\n Are\npropositions of this sort abstract objects? If all the particulars are\nconcrete then perhaps propositions are concrete objects, even if\nproperties and relations are abstract. For one may say that\npropositions are where and when the particulars which are their\nconstituents are. But this sounds arbitrary. Why not say that\npropositions are where their constituent properties and relations are,\nthat is, nowhere? In any case, that particulars (and even properties\nand relations) are concrete does not immediately settle the matter\nwhether propositions in the sense of complexes of particulars and\nproperties and/or relations are abstract objects. For what kind of\ncomplex entities are propositions? Sometimes they are considered to be\nordered sets. If this is what propositions are, then\nthe nominalist needs a satisfactory nominalistic account of ordered\nsets. If propositions are another kind of complex entity, then the\nnominalist about propositions must make sure that objects of that kind\nare concrete.\n\n\nOne nominalist option is to show that the roles associated with\npropositions (e.g. being truth-bearers and objects of propositional\nattitudes) are actually played by concrete objects. One common thought\nhere is to propose that sentences play the roles associated by\npropositions. This strategy is exemplified by Quine. In Word and\nObject he proposes eternal sentences as truth-bearers (Quine 1960,\n208). Eternal sentences are better as truth-bearers than other\nsentences in being true or false independently of time, place, speaker\nand the like. But they are as bad as other sentences in admitting of\nvariation in truth value from one language to another (Quine 1969,\n 142).[18]\n But note that from the point of view of a nominalist about\nabstract objects, there is a much worse problem with eternal sentences,\nnamely that they may be abstract objects. They may be abstract objects\nbecause they are sentence types, and a type may be an abstract\nobject, for instance if one takes them to be sets or abstract\nuniversals (admittedly one might attempt to take them to be\nnon-abstract universals).\n\n\nThe alternative is to take concrete token sentences (utterances or\nwritten inscriptions) as the objects that play the roles normally\nassociated with propositions. One problem here is that only a finite\nnumber of sentences ever get uttered. And so some find it difficult to\nmake sense of general logical laws, e.g. the law that any two\nfalsehoods form a false disjunction, since the disjunction may not get\nuttered or written (Quine 1969, 143). (One possible solution might be\nto reformulate the law so as to say that if the disjunction of\nP and Q exists, it is false if and only if\nP and Q are false.)\n\n\nIn this area, as in many others, a nominalist strategy is to supply\na nominalistically acceptable paraphrase of sentences that appear to\nposit abstract entities. That is, there are certain sentences that seem\nto be true and whose truth seems to entail that there are propositions.\nThe nominalist can then paraphrase those sentences into others which\nallegedly mean the same and whose truth seems to entail only the\nexistence of, say, token sentences. For example, \u2018Seneca said\nthat man is a rational animal\u2019 is true and seems to entail that\nthere is a proposition, namely what Seneca said. But according to\nScheffler's inscriptionalism, on which that-clauses are treated\nas single predicates of concrete inscriptions, to say that Seneca said\nthat man is a rational animal is simply to say that Seneca produced a\nthat-man-is-a-rational-animal inscription (Scheffler 1954, 84).\n\n\nSo we have a sentence whose truth apparently entails the existence\nof propositions and an alleged paraphrase that apparently entails the\nexistence of concrete inscriptions only. Assuming that they do have the\nsame meaning (in which case both sentences entail exactly the same),\nwhy think that the apparent ontological commitments (i.e. those\nentities the truth of a sentence appears to entail) of the nominalistic\nparaphrase are the real ontological commitments of both the paraphrase\nand the original sentence? The fact that the original sentence and its\nparaphrase are semantically equivalent does not give any reason to\nthink that the real ontological commitments of both are the apparent\nontological commitments of the paraphrase rather than those of the\noriginal sentence. (This point has its source in Alston 1958,\n9\u201310.) What the nominalist must do is to argue that the\nparaphrase reveals and makes apparent the real meaning of the original\nsentence, so that the apparent commitments of the paraphrase are the\nreal commitments of both paraphrase and original sentence.\n\n\nAnother nominalist option is to deny that there are propositions and\nany entities that play their theoretical roles. If so, apparently true\nsentences that entail the existence of propositions are false. Thus\nthis kind of Nominalism about propositions is a sort of fictionalism,\ncalled semantic fictionalism (Balaguer \n 1998).[19]\n Thus a\nsentence like \u2018Nestor believed that the gods do not give men all\nthings at the same time\u2019 is not true on this account because (a)\n\u2018that\u2019-clauses (like \u2018that the gods do not give men\nall things at the same time\u2019) are referential singular terms, (b)\nif anything is the referent of \u2018that the gods do not give men all\nthings at the same time\u2019, this is a proposition, and (c) there\nare no propositions. Thus talk about propositions is a fiction, since\nthere aren't any, but it is a useful fiction since it is a\ndescriptive aid that allows us to make it easier to say what we want to\nsay about the world and it allows us to represent the structure of\ncertain parts of the world \u2014 for instance the logico-linguistic\nstructure of propositions can be used to represent the empirical\nstructure of belief states (Balaguer 1998, 817\u201318).\n4.2.2 Nominalism about possible worlds\n\n\nThe word \u2018Nominalism\u2019 is not very often used to refer to\nany stance with respect to possible worlds. But since some philosophers\ntake possible worlds to be abstract objects, a nominalist about\npossible worlds will be, for the purposes of this section, someone who\nthinks that possible worlds are not abstract objects, and this will\ninclude those who believe that there are no possible worlds (but not\nthose who simply do not believe that they \n exist).[20]\n\n\n\nThe question about the nature of possible worlds is a hotly debated\ntopic. Some, for instance Alvin Plantinga, think that possible worlds\nare states of affairs that are both possible and maximal. A maximal\nstate of affairs is one that includes or precludes every state of\naffairs \u2014 where a state of affairs S includes a state\nof affairs S* if and only if it is not possible that S\nobtain and S* fail to obtain, and S precludes S*\nif and only if it is not possible that both obtain (Plantinga 1974,\n45; 2003a, 107; 2003b,\n 194).[21] \n According to Plantinga possible but not necessary\nstates of affairs can obtain and can fail to obtain. Those states of\naffairs that obtain are actual. The actual world includes every actual\nstate of affairs (Plantinga 2003a, 107; 2003b, 195). Merely possible\nstates of affairs and worlds exist but do not obtain (Plantinga 2003a,\n107; 2003b, 195). States of affairs, and therefore possible worlds,\nare thought of as abstract objects by Plantinga. Indeed even the\nactual world is an abstract object for Plantinga, since it has no\ncenter of mass, it is neither a concrete object nor a mereological sum\nof concrete objects and, like the state of affairs of Ford's being\ningenious, has no spatial parts at all (2003a, 107).\n\n\nFor Stalnaker possible worlds are ways the world might have been and\nsuch ways are properties (2003, 7). All these ways the world might have\nbeen actually exist but only one of them is instantiated \u2014 the\nway the world actually is. He naturally takes these properties to be\nabstract objects (2003, \n 32).[22]\n A view like this has been further\ndeveloped by Peter Forrest, who proposes certain properties that he\ncalls natures (certain conjunctions of natural non-relational\nproperties) to play the role played by possible worlds. These natures\nare, for the most part, uninstantiated properties (1986a, 15). It is\nnatural to think that they are abstract \n objects.[23]\n\n\n\nAnother option is to take possible worlds as maximally consistent\nsets of propositions. R. M. Adams (1974) sketched such a theory. If\npropositions are abstract objects, then on this theory possible worlds\nare abstract objects. But there are other options open. Adams suggests\nthat someone might, \u00e0 la Leibniz, take propositions to\nbe thoughts in the mind of God. But if so, and if God is in time and\ntherefore concrete, then presumably his thoughts also are. And if we\nassume that sets of spatiotemporally located entities are\nspatiotemporally located (because they are wherever and whenever their\nmembers are), then sets of concrete objects are concrete. Thus sets of\nthoughts of a concrete deity are concrete.\n\n\nAnother option would be to take possible worlds as sets of spacetime\npoints and think of each such set as representing the possibility that\nall and only the points in it are occupied (the view is proposed as an\nillustration in Cresswell 1972, \n 136).[24]\n This assumes, as Cresswell\nnotes, that all properties of things are determined by the properties\nof certain basic entities whose properties can all be expressed in\nterms of the spacetime points they occupy. If sets of spacetime points can be\nseen as concrete then this might be a way of taking possible worlds as\nconcrete. This view derives from certain passages by Quine, where he\ndevelops the idea that every distribution of space points could be\ntaken as a possible world momentary state (1969, 148). But to avoid\ncertain difficulties (some having to do with ontological economy,\nothers having to do with the notion of a point and the relativity of\nposition), Quine proposes to bypass spacetime points and takes possible\nworlds as certain sets of number quadruples (Quine\n1969, 151). To be nominalistically acceptable this account of possible\nworlds would need to be accompanied by a nominalistically acceptable\ntreatment of sets and numbers.\n\n\nAll the previously mentioned accounts of possible worlds are\nactualist in the sense that they take actual existence and existence\nsimpliciter to coincide. One of the most developed\nnominalistic accounts of possible worlds, that of David Lewis, is not\nactualist but possibilist: according to Lewis to exist\nsimpliciter is one thing and to be actual is another. For\nLewis \u2018actual\u2019 is an indexical predicate so that from the\npoint of view of each world only that world is actual and none of the\nothers are. Thus, unlike Plantinga, Adams, and Stalnaker, Lewis does not\ntake every possible world to exist actually.\n\n\nFor Lewis possible worlds are maximal sums of spatiotemporally\nrelated objects. A sum of spatiotemporally related objects is maximal\nif and only if nothing that is not part of the sum is spatiotemporally\nrelated to any part of the sum in question. Since sums of\nspatiotemporally related objects are sums of concrete objects, and sums\nof concrete objects are concrete objects, Lewisian possible worlds are\nconcrete \n objects.[25]\n,\n[26]\n\n\n\nAnother theory of possible worlds has been developed\nby David Armstrong. Armstrong has an actualist combinatorialist theory\nof possibility, according to which what is possible is determined by\nappropriate combinations of actual elements (particulars and\nuniversals). The basic notion in Armstrong's theory of\npossibility and possible worlds is that of an atomic state of affairs.\nA state of affairs brings together a particular and a universal (if\nthe universal is a property), or some particulars and a universal (if\nthe universal is a \n relation).[27]\n\n\n\nThese elements (particulars and universals) define a range of\ncombinations, some of them actualised, some not. These combinations\nmust respect the form of states of affairs (thus Aristotle's\nbeing wise is an actualised combination, Aristotle's\nbeing a general is an unactualised combination, and\nwisdom's being Aristotle does not respect the form of\nstates of affairs and so does not fall in the range of combinations\ndefined by particulars and universals). The possible atomic states of\naffairs are the combinations of particulars and universals which\nrespect the form of states of affairs. The merely possible atomic\nstates of affairs are the recombinations of particulars and\nuniversals, i.e. those combinations which do not actually occur, like\nAristotle's being a \n general.[28]\n Possible worlds are, for\nArmstrong, conjunctions of possible atomic states of affairs (1989, 47,\n 48).[29]\n\n\n\nArmstrong's combinatorialism is actualist in the sense that\neverything that exists actually exists. But he does not identify his\nmerely possible states of affairs and merely possible worlds with\nactually existing entities. So merely possible states of affairs and\nworlds do not actually exist and, therefore, given Armstrong's\nactualism, do not exist at all (Armstrong 1989, 49).\n\n\nArmstrong's rejection of possible worlds is not exactly a nominalistic\nstance about them since his opposition to them is not based on their\nalleged abstract character. In believing that possible worlds do not\nexist, Armstrong is rather a kind of fictionalist about possible\nworlds, and so he calls himself (1989, 49). But if one believes that\npossible worlds do not exist, and so one is a fictionalist about\npossible worlds in this sense, one can also be a fictionalist about\npossible worlds in a different sense, namely the sense of\nso-called modal fictionalism. According to modal fictionalism\nsentences with an apparent quantification over possible worlds must be\nunderstood as quantification within the scope of a story prefix (Rosen\n1990, 332). Let PW be a theory that postulates possible\nworlds. \u2018According to PW\u2019 is then a story\nprefix.[30] Thus\nthe modal fictionalist says that when he utters \u2018There is a\npossible world where there are blue swans\u2019 what he is really\nsaying is that according to PW there is a world where there are blue\nswans (Rosen 1990, 332). But since quantification within a story\nprefix is not existentially committing, the modal fictionalist can\nutter things like \u2018Since there might have been blue swans, there\nis a possible world where there are blue swans\u2019 without\ncommitting himself to possible\n worlds.[31]\n\n\n\nNow, from the point of view of a nominalist, adoption of modal\nfictionalism must be coupled with some sort of nominalistically\nacceptable account of stories, or theories, or representations in\ngeneral. For accepting something like \u2018According to PW there are\nworlds where there are blue swans\u2019 seems to commit one to PW, and\nPW is a theory, and so one seems thereby committed to theories. But\ntheories seem to be abstract objects. So the fictionalist nominalist\nneeds a nominalist account of theories. If, for instance, theories are\nsets of propositions, a nominalist account of sets and propositions\nwould do as a nominalistic account of \n theories.[32]\n",
