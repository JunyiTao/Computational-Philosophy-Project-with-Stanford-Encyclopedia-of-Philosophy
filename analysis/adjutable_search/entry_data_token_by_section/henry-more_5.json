    "main_text": "More\u2019s Manual of Metaphysics\n6. More\u2019s Manual of Metaphysics: Space, Duration, and God\n\nAfter opening discussions on the nature of metaphysics, on\ndistinctions, and on the divisions of being, More argues that the\nproper subject of metaphysics is incorporeal being, or spiritual\nsubstance. Each of the next twenty chapters (Chapters 6\u201325)\nfocus on a single \u201cmethod of proving the existence of immaterial\nsubstance\u201d (More 1671, 42). These are drawn from natural\nphilosophy, rather than from metaphysics: \u201cFrom gravity\u201d,\n\u201cFrom pneumatic experiments\u201d, \u201cFrom vortices and\ncomets\u201d, and so forth. The most significant addition to\nMore\u2019s earlier work appears in Chapter 8 where More uses his\nconcept of space as the perfect example of immaterial spirit. He\ndismisses Aristotle\u2019s and Descartes\u2019s concepts of place\nbefore presenting his own views on a real, self-existing space in some\ndetail. More\u2019s concept will be familiar to modern readers who\nare acquainted with Newton\u2019s notion of absolute space. It is\nessentially a three-dimensional Euclidean space which is infinite in\nextent, completely isomorphous, and void except where it is occupied\nby body. For More, however, it is also the best example of\nimmaterial\u2014and therefore spiritual\u2014reality in the world.\nWhat makes it the best example for More is that it is completely\nundeniable. As one of the characters in More\u2019s Divine\nDialogues (1668) is made to say, referring to the scholastic\ntradition of calling the supposed infinite space beyond the sphere of\nthe fixed stars, \u201cimaginary space\u201d: space is \u201cso\nimaginary that it cannot be dis-imagined by human understanding\u201d\n(More 1668, 54).\n\nPreviously, More had relied upon the Spirit of Nature as the supreme\nexample of immaterial substance in the world, but of course, he could\nonly insist upon the reality of this Spirit indirectly; arguing that\nit must exist to explain gravity, magnetism, generation, and other\nphenomena that presented real problems for the mechanical philosophy\n(Henry 1986, 1990). The advantage of using space to\ndemonstrate the main features of immaterial substance was precisely\nbecause (at least, according to More, disregarding Aristotle,\nDescartes, and others) nobody could deny that space existed. The\nbeauty, and the forcefulness, of using space as the exemplar of spirit\nis that its existence cannot be denied. It cannot be denied not just\nbecause everyone is aware of space by virtue of everyday experience,\nbut also because, according to More, it is inconceivable that the\nworld could exist without a space for it to occupy. \u201cFor we must\neither acknowledge\u201d, More wrote, \u201cthat there is a certain\nextended [entity] besides matter, or that God could not create finite\nmatter\u201d (More 1671, 42).\n\nMore was evidently so excited by his realisation that space could\nrepresent immaterial substance that he went on to draw close parallels\nbetween absolute space and God. He demonstrated this by enumerating\n\u201cabout twenty titles which the metaphysicians attribute to God\nand which fit the immobile extended [entity] or internal place\u201d.\nIt is worth quoting in full:\n\n\nWhen we shall have enumerated those names and titles appropriate to\nit, this infinite immobile, extended [entity] will appear to be not\nonly something real (as we have just pointed out) but even something\nDivine (which so certainly is found in nature); this will give us\nfurther assurance that it cannot be nothing since that to which so\nmany and such magnificent attributes pertain cannot be nothing. Of\nthis kind are the following, which metaphysicians attribute\nparticularly to the First Being, such as: One, Simple, Immobile,\nExternal, complete, Independent, Existing in itself, Subsisting by\nitself, Incorruptible, Necessary, Immense, Uncreated, Uncircumscribed,\nIncomprehensible, Omnipresent, Incorporeal, All-penetrating,\nAll-embracing, Being by its essence, Actual Being, Pure Act.\n\nThere are not less than twenty titles by which the Divine Numen is\nwont to be designated, and which perfectly fit this infinite internal\nplace (locus) the existence of which in nature we have demonstrated;\nomitting moreover that the very Divine Numen is called, by the\nCabbalists, MAKOM, that is, Place (locus) (More 1671, 69\u201370; see\nalso Copenhaver 1980, Grant 1981, Reid 2012, Leech 2013).\n\n\nMore goes through each of the divine attributes in turn to show how\nthey apply to space. He even contrives to apply the final notion,\n\u201cPure Act\u201d, to space: \u201cit is aptly called being\nin act as it cannot but be conceived as existing outside of its\ncauses. And, finally, pure Act, since it exists from itself\nnecessarily, nor is it affected by any other thing, by which it can be\ncompleted or acted on in some way\u201d (More 1671, 72).\n\nIt is difficult to be sure precisely how closely More wants us to take\nthe analogy between God and space. Clearly space and God are not one\nand the same, but More at the very least regards space as an\ninstrument, or organ, through which God creates and maintains the\nworld, and without which He could not have created it. It is this last\npoint which is crucial. More insisted that for something to exist, it\nmust exist in space. This included God himself, and More was the first\ntheologian or philosopher to propose that God must be an extended\ninfinite being (Grant 1981, 223). Given the intimate connection\nbetween God and space and the supposition that nothing could exist\nunless space existed, God did not have to will space into existence.\nSpace was held to be an emanative effect of God. Accordingly, just as\nlight spontaneously emanates from a lit candle, so space emanates from\nGod. The world is necessarily dualistic, therefore. There cannot be a\nmonistic world, comprised solely of matter. Matter requires space to\naccommodate its extended nature, but space is immaterial substance,\nand so the world must be dualist in nature (Grant 1981, 226\u201327;\nReid 2012, 138; Leech 2013; Thomas 2018, 51\u20132).\n\nMore\u2019s concept of space is crucially important, therefore, for\nmaking the truth of his dualistic world picture undeniable, or so he\nbelieves. To reinforce the truth of his concept of space More also\ndismisses what he calls nullibism, the Cartesian view that\nsouls can exist nowhere, or not in space. Clearly, this view\ncompletely undermines More\u2019s position, and so he dismisses it as\nnonsensical\u2014for something to exist, More insists, it must exist\nin space (Leech 2013). He also dismisses the view (having previously\nheld it himself, Reid 2003), which he calls holenmerianism,\nthat the immortal soul exists in its entirety in every part of the\nhuman body. This is the traditional view in Christian theology, which\nholds that the soul is in all parts of the body (since all parts are\nalive), but as the soul is indivisible it cannot be extended through\nthe body (otherwise a severed arm might contain part of the soul,\nseparated from the rest of the soul), but must exist everywhere as a\nwhole (and evidently immediately abandons a severed limb). Again, this\nis a notion of physical presence which clouds More\u2019s claims\nabout the straightforward relationship between existence and space,\nand so must also be dismissed (Henry 1986; Reid 2003, 2012; Leech\n2013). Indeed, More\u2019s objection to holenmerianism, as with\nnullibism, was that it is nonsensical and merely likely to make the\ncommon reader dismiss it out of hand, and by extension, dismiss the\nconcept of soul (Henry 1986, 191\u201392).\n\nIn More\u2019s mature philosophy, then, there was a strict dichotomy\nbetween matter and spirit but that dichotomy was not defined,\nas it was in Cartesianism, in terms of extension and non-extension.\nBecause More was committed to the idea that all real entities must\nexist in space, spirit, no less than body, was extended. Accordingly,\nbody was defined as \u201cA Substance impenetrable and\ndiscerpible\u201d, and spirit as \u201cA Substance penetrable and\nindiscerpible\u201d. Discerpible and indiscerpible, neologisms of\nMore\u2019s, mean capable of being physically separated into parts,\nand incapable of being separated into parts, respectively. Presumably\nMore preferred his new terms because, for those readers who knew\nLatin, it conveyed a notion of tearing a piece off. More perhaps\nwanted to avoid objections to the indivisibility of extended spirits\nof the kind levelled against the concept of atoms: if an atom has\ndimensions, however small, it is conceptually divisible, even\nif atomists wish to claim it is physically indivisible. More conceded\nthat an extended spirit could be conceptually divided, but his point\nwas that it is impossible (even in thought) to grab hold of a spirit\nand tear a piece off it. If you are thinking in those terms, you are\nnot thinking properly about the nature of spirit. The other major\ndistinguishing feature of body and spirit, of course, as we have seen,\nwas that bodies were inert and passive, and immaterial spirits were\nnaturally active, and indeed increasingly responsible, throughout\nMore\u2019s career, for any activity in the world (Henry 1986; Reid\n2003, 2012; Leech 2013). \n\nAs well as believing that everything must exist in space, More also\nbelieved that everything must exist in time. Furthermore, time, like\nspace, is a real absolute thing which cannot possibly not exist.\nAssuming the world to be not much over 5,000 years old (in accordance\nwith the standard view), More insisted that if God annihilated the\nworld after 1000 years and then had recreated it a thousand years ago,\nthere must have been a gap \u201cof above three thousand yeare\u201d\n(Nicolson 1992, 487). Just as the existence of space cannot be\n\u201cdis-imagined\u201d, so the existence of time cannot be\ndis-imagined. Accordingly, like space, time is conceived of as an\nattribute of God: God\u2019s existence entails the existence of\nspace, and the existence of time (Thomas 2018, 51). Infinite space and\ninfinite duration are said to be \u201ccertain adulterated\nrepresentations of the divine eternity and immensity\u201d\n(adulterinas quasdam esse Aeternitatis Immensitatisque Divinae\nRepraesentationes) (More 1675\u201379, 172; Thomas 2018,\n54).\n\nJust as God\u2019s proposed extension had to be protected from\ncharges that he must therefore be divisible (by introducing the\nconcept of indiscerpibility), so his existence in time had to be\nprotected from charges that his existence must be successive (and\ntherefore susceptible to change from moment to moment) (Thomas 2018,\n38). More insisted, accordingly, that God\u2019s existence was not\nsuccessive, but that his existence somehow transcended time and was\npresent to all eternity all at once (Thomas 2018, 34). It has been\nsuggested, therefore, that with regard to time or duration, More\naccepted a holenmeristic view that God could be entirely \u201cin\nevery moment yet is not spread out in time\u201d (Thomas 2018, 45).\nHolenmerism with regard to space is the view that God is entirely in\nthe whole of space and entirely in every tiny part of space;\nso, it cannot be equated with the view that he is entirely in every\ntiny part of time, but is not in the whole of time. It is by\nno means clear, therefore, that \u201cwhilst More rejected\nholenmerism for divine spatial presence, he maintained it for divine\ntemporal presence\u201d (Thomas 2018, 45). We should bear in\nmind that \u201cholenmerism\u201d was a neologism coined by More and\nhe applied it only to claims about spatial occupation. To say that God\nis everywhere in his entirety and in every part of space (be it never\nso small) in his entirety is clearly an absurd claim, a \u201cmad\nJingle\u201d, as More said (1662, Immortality of the Soul,\nseparately paginated, 43). But to say that all moments of time, past,\npresent, and future, are simultaneously present to an eternal God,\nwhile certainly puzzling, does not seem so obviously contradictory.\nThe historical fact is, More\u2019s view of God\u2019s relationship\nto time was fairly standard among contemporary theologians, and should\nnot be compared with his highly radical and unheard of view of\nGod\u2019s relationship to space (Grant 1981, 223).\n\nReturning to the Enchiridion metaphysicum, as in the\nAntidote Against Atheism, and the Immortality of the\nSoul, More also draws upon various physical phenomena which he\nbelieves cannot be explained in terms of the mechanical philosophy,\nand can only be understood if some other factor is at work, namely the\nSpirit of Nature. More included an example drawn from the series of\nexperiments Boyle had conducted using the newly invented air-pump, and\nwhich he had published in 1660. It is essentially the experiment\ndescribed in the Immortality of the Soul, in which the piston\nof the pump lifts a heavy weight (this time 100 pounds, rather than\nten), against gravity. The crucial difference is that here it is\nexplicitly described as Boyle did it, and explicitly named as\nBoyle\u2019s experiment.\n\nAlthough More clearly believed he was engaged in establishing the true\nreligion, and the true philosophy to support it, not everyone agreed.\nAs soon as the Somerset virtuoso, John Beale (1608\u20131683), saw\nit, he wrote to Henry Oldenburg, Secretary of the Royal Society, in\nstrident tones:\n\nDid not I tell yu, wt was to be expected from Dr H. M. His confidence\nis as strong as Enthusiasme; & yet yu see what he does. As if he\nhad a minde to drawe a suspicion, or (at least) to rayse the style of\nInfamy agst ye R[oyal] S[ociety] & candid Experiment, as to be so\nMagicall as to call in ye ayde of Spirits & Angels. If Honble Mr\nBoyles health will bear it, He owes him a chastisement\u2026\n(Letter, 24 June 1671, Oldenburg [1671\u20131672] 1971, 120).\n\n\nThe chastisement came in Boyle\u2019s Hydrostatical\nDiscourse of 1672. Furthermore, it is evident from Boyle\u2019s\ncomments that he objected not only to More\u2019s bad physics, but\nalso to what he saw as potentially divisive theology. After all, Boyle\npointed out, even \u201cHeathen Philosophers\u201d were convinced by\ntheir studies of nature of the existence of God, and they had no need\nto suppose an intermediary Spirit of Nature: \u201ctaking no notice\nof an immaterial principium hylarchicum, they believed things\nto be managed in a mere physical way according to the General Laws,\nsettled [by God] among things Corporeal, acting upon one\nanother\u201d (Boyle 1999, 184). Boyle believed in incorporeal\nsubstance but objected to the attempt to prove its existence by\nrelying on a \u201cprecarious Principle\u201d such as the Spirit of\nNature (Boyle 1999, 184).\n\nBoyle was not alone in his criticisms. Sir Mathew Hale took time off\nfrom his legal studies to publish two critiques, which More tried to\nanswer in his Remarks upon two late ingenious Discourses\n(1676). Somehow Lady Conway heard that \u201cMr Boyle sayes you had\nbetter never have printed it, for you are mistaken in all your\nexperiments\u201d (Nicolson 1992, 420). The German physicist, Johann\nChristoph Sturm (1635\u20131703) dismissed More\u2019s\ninterpretation of Boyle\u2019s experiments in 1676 in Epistola ad\nVirum Celeberrimum Henricum Morum de Spiritu ipsius Hylarchio.\nRobert Hooke took the opportunity to reject More\u2019s views in his\nLampas: or, Descriptions of some Mechanical Improvements of Lamps\n& Waterpoises of 1677.\n\nIt is known that Boyle was intermittently writing a study throughout\nthese years of the various different concepts of Nature at use in\ndifferent discourses. When this finally appeared in print in 1686 as\nthe Free Enquiry into the Vulgarly Received Notion of Nature,\nMore\u2019s ideas were included as a target for Boyle\u2019s\ncritical barbs. But Boyle did not just attack More\u2019s views on\nthe Spirit of Nature, he also took the opportunity to dismiss\nMore\u2019s necessitarian theology, in favour of his own voluntarist\ntheology:\n\nGod is a free agent, and created the world, not out of necessity, but\nvoluntarily, having framed it, as he pleased and thought fit, at the\nbeginning of things, when there was no substance but Himself, and\nconsequently no creature, to which he could be obliged, or by which he\ncould be limited (Boyle 2000, 566).\n\n\nBoyle was not the clearest writer and often garbled his arguments but\nthe implication here (seen more clearly in the claim that he created\nthe world as he pleased than in the claim that he was not obliged to\nany creature) is that God did not have to create a world in accordance\nwith pre-established values of goodness (Henry 1990). Certainly, he\nhad already denied the claim that God had been obliged to create the\nbest of all possible worlds:\n\nI think it very unsafe to deny that God, who is almighty and\nomniscient, and an owner of perfections which, for ought we know, are\nparticipable in more different manners and degrees than we can\ncomprehend, could not display\u2026 them, by creating a work more\nexcellent than this world. And, his immense power and unexhausted\nwisdom considered, it will not follow either, that because this world\nof ours is an admirable piece of workmanship, the divine architect\ncould not have bettered it\u2026 (Boyle 2000, 495)\n\n",
