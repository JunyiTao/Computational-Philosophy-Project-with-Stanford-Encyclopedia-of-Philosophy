As Nishitani confided later to a student: \u201cDuring the\nwar we were struck on the cheek from the right; after the war we were\nstruck on the cheek from the left.\u201d\n\nDuring the war, the stance of the Kyoto School was considered too\ncosmopolitan and insufficiently nationalistic, even anti-war. The\ndiscussions published in The Standpoint of World History and\nJapan were branded by the Imperial Way ideologues as\n\u201civory-tower speculations that risked reducing the Empire to\nsimply one more category of world history,\u201d and further\nprintings of the book were reportedly stopped by the government\ncensors (see Horio 1994, 291). After the war, the Kyoto School\u2019s\nidealistic attempts to impart meaning and direction to Japan\u2019s\n\u201cworld historical mission\u201d were seen\u2014especially by\nliberals and leftists that had at long last been freed from repression\nand persecution\u2014as support for its de facto\nmilitaristic fascism. Nishitani and others were purged for several\nyears from their university positions. Even when they were later\nreinstated, the stigma of the Kyoto School as having \u201ccooperated\nin the war\u201d was hardly erased. Their political thought in\nparticular was dismissed in toto, and it was not until\ndecades later that the topic of \u201covercoming modernity\u201d was\nonce again given serious critical attention (see Kawakami &\nTakeuchi 1979; Hiromatsu 1989; and \u014chashi 1992, 143ff.).\n\nThe Kyoto School thinkers rarely responded directly to their critics\nafter the war, and we can only speculate on the reasons for this (see\nHorio 1994, 300). They accepted suspension from their posts without\ncomment or complaint, and continued on with their philosophizing,\nalbeit without the overtly political element of their thought.\nNishitani, for example, came into his own as a philosopher of religion\nin the postwar era. He continued to philosophically develop Eastern\nideas, those of Zen Buddhism in particular, in dialogue with medieval\nChristian mysticism as well as postmodern existentialism and\nphenomenology and in response to what he saw as the central problem of\nmodernity, namely, nihilism. In his mature attempts to \u201covercome\nnihilism by way of passing through nihilism\u201d (NKC XX, 192), we\nfind a significant thread of continuity with his pre-war and wartime\nattempts to overcome (Western) modernity by way of passing through it.\nBut it is nevertheless possible to mark a crucial and self-critical\n\u201cturn\u201d in his thinking with regard to the question of the\npolitical role\u2014or, as it turns out, the lack of one\u2014to be\nplayed by the Japanese state in this overcoming of modernity and\nnihilism by way of passing through them (see Davis 2008b).\n\nTanabe got a head start on the postwar critics and toward the end of\nthe war began thinking his way through a radical crisis of\nself-critique. Hardly less controversial than the roundtable\ndiscussions of the younger members of the Kyoto School have been\nTanabe\u2019s application\u2014or misapplication\u2014of his\n\u201clogic of the specific\u201d to a discourse on the legitimacy\nof the self-assertion of the Japanese nation-state as an archetype for\nothers. The \u201clogic of the specific\u201d had originally been\nconceived, in critique of Bergson and Nishida, as a reappraisal of the\nlogical and ethical role that ethnic specificity plays in mediating\nthe particular individual and universal humanity. Adapting\nHegel\u2019s political philosophy, Tanabe thought that the\nnation-state could both embody the ethnic specificity of the people\nand raise it out of its inherent irrationality. As a concrete\nuniversal, the nation-state was, if not the absolute itself, in some\nsense the dialectical manifestation of the absolute on earth.\n\nThe critical lapse came when Tanabe irrationally proposed that the\n\u201crelative absolute\u201d of the Japanese nation-state could\nserve as a kind of \u201csupreme archetype\u201d for other nations\n(see THZ VI, 232\u201333). James Heisig writes that, in so doing,\nTanabe \u201ctook a step that was fatal but really unnecessary, if\nnot outright inconsistent with the principles of his logic\u2026.\nAccording to his own logic, the community of the human race is to be\nmade up of a community of nations that have found a way to transcend\ntheir specificity without transcending time and culture. Each nation\nmay come about as an instance of the generic universal, but nothing in\nthe logic of the specific allows any one instance to become an\narchetype for the others. It is as if Tanabe were quoting himself out\nof context\u201d (Heisig 2001, 136\u201337; also see Heisig\n1994).\n\nTanabe finally came to his senses and, in a striking metanoetic turn,\nrenounced these political assertions and dove into the philosophy of\nreligion. Philosophy as Metanoetics, the first parts of which\nwere delivered as lectures in 1944 before the end of the war, was\ncomposed not only as a personal self-critique, but also as a call to\nself-critique on the part of the entire nation, and indeed ultimately\nas a call for an \u201cabsolute critique\u201d of human rationality\nas such (see the Preface to THZ X; Tanabe 1986). It is the last of\nthese that is the central theme of the book: the idea that the human\nreason is inevitably driven to antinomies through which it must\nrepeatedly die to its own self-power in order to be reborn again\nthrough the workings of an Other-power. It is nevertheless true that\n\u201cone looks through that work in vain for any admission of guilt\nfor particular actions or statements that he had made\u201d (Heisig\n2001, 151). In any case, Tanabe\u2019s public (if vague) repentance\nwas no more successful than the silence of other Kyoto School thinkers\nin convincing the majority of postwar Japanese academics to refrain\nfrom throwing the baby of their philosophical insights out with the\nbathwater of their political misadventures.\n\nOnly in the past few decades has the reputation of the Kyoto School\nbeen significantly rehabilitated in Japan, due in part to a general\nrecovery of the nation from immersion in the march of postwar economic\nprogress and evasion of unresolved cultural aporias, in part to a\ngeneral reaffirmation of cultural identity (including all too often a\npendulum swing back to ethnocentric reassertions of \u201cJapanese\nuniqueness\u201d), and in part to the positive attention the School\nhas received from scholars in the West. It is worthwhile noting, as\nFujita Masakatsu does in his preface to The Philosophy of the\nKyoto School, that prior to 2001 surprisingly few articles or\nbooks had appeared in Japan with a thematic focus on the \u201cKyoto\nSchool\u201d as such, even though hundreds of studies had treated\n\u201cNishida Philosophy.\u201d Yet there are promising signs that\nwe are entering a new academic era in which critical yet appreciative\nwork on the Kyoto School can be cooperatively undertaken in Japan, in\nthe West, and recently even in other parts of East Asia (see Fujita et\nal. 2003; Heisig 2004; Synthesis Philosophica 2004; Fujita\n& Davis 2005; Hori & Curley 2008; Heisig & Uehara 2008;\nLam & Cheung 2009; Bouso & Heisig 2009; Davis, Schroeder,\n& Wirth 2011; Elberfeld & Arisaka 2014; Yusa 2017; Davis\n2020a; Liao et al. 2022).\n\nDespite the persistence of a faction of polemical intellectual\nhistorians, many philosophers worldwide today view the political\nmisadventures of the Kyoto School as lamentable footnotes to the main\ntext of their laudable philosophical endeavors. While research into\ntheir political thought\u2014regarding what it tried to say then and\nregarding what it can or cannot help us to think now\u2014remains\nnecessary and important, at the end of the day many are likely to\nagree with James Heisig when he emphatically writes: \u201cOne\nhas \u2026 to ignore the greatest bulk of the writings of these\nthinkers to arrive at the conclusion that anything approaching or\nsupporting the imperialistic ideology of wartime Japan belongs to the\nfundamental inspiration of their thought\u201d (Heisig 2001, 6).\nThe philosophical and cross-cultural legacy of the Kyoto School lies\nelsewhere.\n",
