    "main_text": "Three Controversies || Polygenesis\n3.1 Polygenesis\n\nA good example of the twists and turns intrinsic to Lotze\u2019s\ndialectic may be illustrated by a brief excursus on his treatment of\nthe \u201cproblem\u201d of \u201crace.\u201d (On this topic, the\nfirst question that might occur to contemporary readers concerns the\nproper domain and ultimate provenance of this \u201cproblem\u201d:\nis it biological, anthropological, sociological or political? does it\nname a theoretical or a practical difficulty?) Although often\ntorturous, these passages provide a sometimes unique insight into the\nmonogenesis-polygenesis debate in the post-Enlightenment. Lotze begins\nhis discussion quite skeptically, averring that the \u201cmuch\ndiscussed problem of the specific unity or diversity of the whole\nhuman race cannot as yet be definitely solved\u201d and he heartily\ncommends this attitude as \u201cthe impression of unprejudiced\npeople\u201d (Micro, I, p. 506). He immediately follows this\nadmonition, however, with a lengthy list of cogent reasons for\nmonogenesis, noting that \u201cin the varieties of the human race\n\u2026 the differences are not so excessive as to render impossible\na historical derivation from a single source\u201d:\n\nIt is true that no race of men possesses any physiologically important\norgan denied to another race; in none is the normal number of multiple\nparts, such as teeth or fingers, different from what it is in another;\nno single joint of the skeleton, no muscular layer, is formed or\nsituated on different plans in different races; all are formed erect,\nall capable of speech; to all physiological processes are assigned on\na common plan; in the duration of life, of pregnancy, in the\nattainment of puberty, along with numerous fluctuations to which, as\nregards each of these points, the human race is liable, there are no\nconstant differences of time distinguishing one race from another. The\nactual differences are varieties in the proportion of size of the\nparts of the body, and more especially in the form and colour of the\nexternal coverings. Assuredly, if Nature had not made the Negro black,\nthe Indian red, the rest of the organisation of these races (whatever\nmight have been the case with the analysis-loving naturalist) would\nnever have suggested to the imagination of men in general any reason\nfor treating them as distinct species, and excluding them from an\norigin common to all \u2026 Finally, let us add that the different\nraces can be propagated by crossing, and as the result of all, it will\nappear that these varieties of the human race are connected together\nby the closest analogy of physical formation (Micro, I, pp.\n508\u2013509).\n\n\nLotze next goes on to consider but reject the very old idea that these\nsuperficial changes (size and color) have been effected by variations\nin such environmental factors as habitat or climate. In this\nsupposition, Lotze believes that the central difficulty for all such\ninvestigations in this area is an inevitable but nonetheless unsavory\ndependence upon \u201cuncertain causes of which we can form no\nconception\u201d (Micro, I, p. 514). Consequently,\n\u201cthe hypothesis of the original unity of the human race cannot\nbe absolutely disproved\u201d (ibid.). The choice between monogenesis\nand polygenesis remains squarely at the level of scientific conjecture\nand no one can determine a priori which hypothesis to rule\nout. What we would prefer is a reliance upon \u201cthe actual facts\nfor which we have the evidence of the senses\u201d (Micro,\nI, p. 524). But even a brief consideration of this data forces upon us\nthe realization that we have, at our disposal, a very small collection\nindeed.\n\nLotze\u2019s seeming indifference and impartiality regarding these\ncompeting hypotheses masks his real and over-arching interests, namely\nestablishing that: (1) much of this debate is actually rooted in\nlogical errors and linguistic difficulties, and (2) value-theoretic\nconclusions are simply not derivable from either scientific theory or\nfact. First, errors arise in the logic of the very process of\nclassification (Micro, I, p. 507) and, then, the very choices\nof terminology\u2014kind, variety, species, genus, etc.\u2014are\nopen to logical or linguistic manipulation completely unconnected from\nthe question at hand, namely \u201cwhether they can all have actually\nsprung from one and the same primitive stock by generation and\nclimactic influences\u201d (Micro, I, p. 522). Second, such\nmere manipulations are not facts and, furthermore, even were strong\nempirical evidence available, it would not provide the upshot its\nproponents suppose. To show this, Lotze constructs the following\ngruesome and impossibly racist scenario:\n\nSupposing it could be proved by irrefragable evidence that the\nancestors of the Negroes were really true undoubted apes, but at the\nsame time the fact remained that the present Negroes walk erect,\nspeak, think, and in general possess the degree of intelligence (be it\ngreat or small) which we know from experience they do\u2014what moral\nexcuse could there be for the cruelty of accommodating the treatment\nof them not to what they are, but to what their ancestors were,\nor\u2014to speak logically\u2014to the kind or species to which by\ntheir descent they belong? (Micro, I, p. 524).\n\n\nWhen we recall that racism was often clothed in the respectability of\nbeing scientific and \u201cup to date,\u201d we can discern\nLotze\u2019s canny move in blocking any ethical conclusion\nbeing derived from seemingly scientific evidence. (And when we recall\nthe subtitle of the Microcosmus \u2013 \u201cattempt at an\nanthropology [Versuch einer Anthropologie]\u201d \u2013\nLotze\u2019s actual motives begin to shine through.)\n\nUltimately, this is part and parcel of Lotze\u2019s overarching\nstrategy of driving a wedge between scientific fact, on the one hand,\nand human significance, meaning and value, on the other: science, to\nwhich falls the task of describing what is, can never provide\nus with the ultimate meaning of or reason behind\nwhat is. Lotze remained convinced that no value theory could be\nderived from science and that, yet, the teleological impulse was\nintrinsic to and irreplaceable in human existence. On more than one\noccasion, he avers to the following line of reasoning:\n\n\u2026 the contemplation of the whole series of graded periods\nduring which formless matter may have been undergoing processes of\nformation would but add to the splendour and variety of the scenes in\nwhose outward pomp our admiring phantasy might revel, but it would not\nexplain the wondrous drama as a whole more adequately than the modest\nbelief which sees nothing but the immediate creative will of God from\nwhich the races of living beings can have been derived\n(Micro, I, p. 527).\n\n\nThe varieties of human beings\u2014should we choose to cast that in\nthe terminology of race or not\u2014appears to be the expression of\nsome formative principle [Bildungstrieb], one whose meaning\nand purpose can never be exhausted by the technical complexity of the\nstory we may adduce about the process of that formation.
