    "main_text": "Justice in Holdings || Nozick\u2019s Lockean Proviso\n4.3 Nozick\u2019s Lockean Proviso\n\nNozick follows Locke in adopting a version of the claim that an\nindividual will have a complaint in justice against otherwise\nperfectly just acquisitions by others if those acquisitions do not\nleave that individual with \u201cenough, and as good\u201d\n(174\u2013182). Although Nozick\u2019s discussion of his Lockean\nproviso is somewhat murky, we can identify three important features of\nthat proviso doctrine.\n\nFirst, whether an individual has a complaint under Nozick\u2019s\nLockean proviso will not be a matter of whether too little natural\nmaterial has been left in common by others or too little material has\nbeen left for that individual to initially acquire. Rather, that\nindividual will have a just complaint against others\u2019\nacquisitions if and only if those acquisitions leave her on net worse\noff in terms of utility or welfare. The individual will have no just\ncomplaint even if her utility or welfare is diminished by a decrease\nin what remains in common or a decrease in what remains available for\nher initial acquisition as long as she is duly compensated in terms of\nutility or welfare by other effects of the acquisitive\nactions of others. The claim at the core of Nozick\u2019s\n\u201cenough, and as good\u201d proviso is only protected by a\nliability rule.\n\nSecond, in his main discussion of it, Nozick maintains that this\nproviso is readily satisfied in free market\n economies.[27]\n This is in part due to the strong tendency of the rising tide of such\neconomies to raise up all those who are willing to swim with it (177).\nIt is also in part due to the low baseline set by the proviso. Nozick\nnever carefully spells out that baseline. But it must be something\nlike how well off the individual under consideration would have been\nhad all natural stuff remained in the common or, perhaps, how well off\nthat individual would be (over his lifetime) were all natural stuff\n(or even all owned stuff) now returned to the common.\n\nThird, the proviso adds \u201can additional bit of complexity into\nthe structure of the entitlement theory\u201d (174). It specifies a\nway in which things could go especially badly for an individual even\nif the acquisitions of others are entirely in accord with the\nprinciples of justice in acquisition and it asserts that individuals\nwould have a complaint in justice should things go that badly for them\nin that way. For Nozick, the primary case for the justice of any\nholding continues to turn on its having arisen through processes that\naccord with the principles of just initial acquisition, just transfer,\nand (if relevant) just rectification. (This is why it is such a\nserious problem that Nozick never spells out those principles and\nnever explains why acquisition in accordance with them has the power\nto engender or convey entitlements.) For Nozick, even if the proviso\nis violated, those who have acquired justly do not have to surrender\ntheir holdings\u2014albeit they need to provide compensation to those\nwhose situations are on net worsened by the existing system of\n holdings.[28]\n",
