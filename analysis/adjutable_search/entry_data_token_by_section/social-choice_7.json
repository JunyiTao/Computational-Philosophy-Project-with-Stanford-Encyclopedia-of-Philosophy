    "main_text": "Three formal arguments for majority rule || A utilitarian argument for majority rule\n2.4 A utilitarian argument for majority rule\n\nAnother consequentialist argument for majority rule is utilitarian\nrather than epistemic. It does not require the existence of an\nindependent fact or state of the world that the collective decision is\nsupposed to track. Suppose each voter gets some utility from the\ncollective decision, which depends on whether the decision matches his\nor her vote (preference): specifically, each voter gets a utility of 1\nfrom a match between his or her vote and the collective outcome and a\nutility of 0 from a\n mismatch.[3]\n The Rae-Taylor theorem then states that if each individual has an\nequal prior probability of preferring each of the two alternatives,\nmajority rule maximizes each individual\u2019s expected utility (see,\ne.g., Mueller 2003).\n\nRelatedly, majority rule minimizes the number of frustrated voters\n(defined as voters on the losing side) and maximizes total utility\nacross voters. Brighouse and Fleurbaey (2010) generalize this result.\nDefine voter \\(i\\)\u2019s stake in the decision, \\(d_i\\), as\nthe utility difference between his or her preferred outcome and his or\nher dispreferred outcome. The Rae-Taylor theorem rests on an implicit\nequal-stakes assumption, i.e., \\(d_i = 1\\) for every \\(i \\in N\\).\nBrighouse and Fleurbaey show that when stakes are allowed to vary\nacross voters, total utility is maximized not by majority rule, but by\na weighted majority rule, where each individual \\(i\\)\u2019s voting\nweight \\(w_i\\) is proportional to his or her stake \\(d_i\\).\n",
