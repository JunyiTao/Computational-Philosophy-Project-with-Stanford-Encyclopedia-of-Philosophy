The Two Faces of Morality: Values and Duties\n\nMoral discourse is normative in nature, that is, concerned with\nguiding behavior rather than describing the world. But this normative\ncharacter of moral judgment falls broadly speaking under two\ncategories, the axiological and the deontic. The former refers to\ngoodness, ideals and virtues; the latter to what ought to be done, to\nduties and obligations, to justice and rights. Whereas the object of\naxiological assessment is primarily states of affairs and human\nagents, the object of deontic evaluation is human actions. For\ninstance, the state of affairs of a world with no war is a moral ideal\nand the individual Socrates is virtuous, whereas the practice of\npaying back debts is obligatory and acts of theft prohibited.\n\nThe axiological face of morality, unlike its deontic counterpart, is\nopen-ended. Virtuous character traits, ethical ideals, or the goal of\npromoting human happiness have no fixed measure and can in principle\nbe always improved and further perfected or realized. Moral\nrequirements are relatively fixed and well defined, having clear\ncriteria of fulfillment and violation. Consequently, the deontic\nsphere of morality is often taken as describing the minimal\nconditions of morality, the basic requirements of social morality that\nsecure a just society, while the axiological sphere aims at higher\nideals which can only be commended and recommended but not strictly\nrequired. In its deontic nature, morality is closely associated with\nthe legal, while the axiological is closer to the ideal or the\nideological (sometimes referred to as \u201cthe ethical\u201d).\nFurthermore, the way in which deontic norms are fixed and universally\nexpected of all members of society presupposes the general\nability of all moral agents to act in the light of these\nnorms. Ideals of goodness and virtue, in their open-ended texture,\ncannot be similarly expected of everyone and their determination is\nnot subjected to the strict condition of \u201c\u2018ought\u2019\nimplies \u2018can\u2019.\u201d\n\nMost ethical theories maintain some form of this two-tier structure of\nthe moral system, although admittedly in different versions and\nemphases. But this double role of normative discourse inevitably\nraises the idea of supererogation, the category of actions that are\npraiseworthy (either in creating good states of affairs or in\nreflecting a particularly virtuous trait of character) yet at the same\ntime not obligatory. Supererogation lies at the intersection of the\naxiological and the deontic, the \u2018good\u2019 and the\n\u2018ought\u2019. Since moral theories of the past (like Aristotle,\nKant and utilitarianism) all appeal in some form to both deontic and\naxiological concepts, the scant and cursory discussion of\nsupererogation in those theories is all the more surprising.\n\nThe most notable exception to this historical generalization is the\nlong-standing and elaborate Roman Catholic doctrine of opera\nsupererogationis. The general background of this doctrine is the\nrecognition of the two faces of morality under the concepts of\n\u201cprecepts\u201d and \u201ccounsels.\u201d The origins of this\ndistinction go back to the New Testament, in which to the question\nwhat one should do to gain eternal life, Jesus replies: \u201cif thou\nwilt enter into life, keep the commandments,\u201d but adds \u201cif\nthou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast and give to the poor and\nthou shalt have treasure in Heaven\u201d (Matthew xix, 16\u201324).\nBeyond charity, the Church Fathers detected in the New Testament two\nadditional evangelical counsels, chastity and obedience: taking a wife\nis no sin, but virginity has a superior value; the life of an ordinary\nChristian cannot be blamed, but that of absolute monastic dedication\nis far better. Forgiveness and love of one\u2019s enemies are also\nreligious ideals that originate in the New Testament and were\nsometimes given a supererogatory interpretation in later Church\ndoctrine.\n\nThe Old Law of the Old Testament is regarded by early Catholic\nthinkers as reflecting the rigid and minimal demands of religious\nmorality, typically formulated in the negative terms of prohibitions\nand precepts (the violation of which entails punishment). The New Law,\nthat of the New Testament, sometimes called the Law of Liberty, leaves\nthe individual free to pursue more edifying ideals of perfection.\nTertullian called this freedom licentia. According to the\nCatholic doctrine, the special merit of supererogatory acts accredited\nto their agent can be used both for that individual\u2019s own\nsalvation and for the salvation of others. The \u201csuperabundant\nmerit,\u201d most typically collected by the actions of Jesus and the\nsaints, who far exceeded what was required for their own salvation, is\ndeposited in the Spiritual Treasury of the Church to be disposed by\nthe Pope and the bishops for remitting the sins of other, ordinary\nbelievers. This is how the institution of Indulgences gradually\ndeveloped in the late middle ages: sinners could buy the remission of\ntheir sins, first by joining the Crusades and later by contributing\nmoney to the coffers of the Church.\n\nThe most articulate exposition of the doctrine of supererogation in\nthe Christian tradition is found in Thomas Aquinas (Summa\nTheologica). Thomas mentions two distinct sources of merit of\nsupererogatory behavior. On the one hand supererogation serves as a\nmore expedient or guaranteed way of achieving everlasting life; on the\nother, it is intrinsically good in being aimed at higher ends than the\nmere fulfillment of the commandments. Precepts are universal in their\nscope, whereas counsels are addressed to the few who have the capacity\nand inclination to pursue the life of perfection. For Thomas, the\nopen-texture character of the counsels of supererogation is what makes\nthe morality of love superior to the authoritarian nature of the\nstrict law. But Thomas does not draw a clear borderline between duty\nand supererogation. It is, for example, not clear whether \u201clove\nthy enemy\u201d is a precept or a supererogatory counsel. It is\nsimilarly unclear whether beneficence (almsgiving) is a duty or lies\nbeyond duty. Nor is the role of virtue in demarcating the\nsupererogatory from the obligatory explained. Thomas says that both\nnatural law and positive law prescribe acts of virtue in general but\nthey do not prescribe every specific virtuous act (except for those\nthat promote the social good of justice and peace). And as for divine\nlaw, it prescribes also other, non-social actions that belong to the\nrelations between man and God but leaves those actions of perfect\nvirtue to the realm of supererogatory counsel.\n\nThe Catholic doctrine of supererogation met with an extremely fierce\nopposition in the times of the Reformation. Luther, Calvin and\nAnglican theologians attacked both the theory of\n\u201csuper-meritorious\u201d actions and the corruption involved in\nthe commercialization of the institution of indulgences for which the\ntheory served as a cover. No human being, not even a saint, can do all\nthat is strictly required as a duty, let alone hope to go beyond that.\nThe way to salvation is not through \u201cworks\u201d but through\ndivine grace alone (Luther 1957). Even the most dramatic acts of\nmartyrdom and self-sacrifice, which served the Catholics as paradigm\nexamples of supererogation, are strictly speaking obligatory.\nProtestant ethics thus undermines the distinction between the two\nfaces of morality: on the one hand, normative requirements cannot be\ndefined in terms of rules fixing minimally prescribed behavior; on the\nother hand, every religiously good behavior is obligatory. Saints and\nsinners are equally dependent on God\u2019s grace for their\nsalvation. Paradoxically, it may be noted, exactly because human\nactions can never fulfill God\u2019s commandments, divine grace is\nnever due or ethically called for: it is typically\nsupererogatory, a free gift of God!\n\nAn interesting parallel to the Christian concept of supererogation can\nbe found in Jewish thought in the notion of \u201clifnim mishurat\nhadin\u201d. Typically, the rabbis dispute its philosophical meaning\nsince it could be literally understood as either \u201cwithin the\nline of law\u201d or \u2014 as it is more often understood \u2014\n\u201cbeyond the line of law\u201d. Some philosophers (like\nNahmanides) follow the former reading, arguing that moral acts of\npiety or charity are obligatory, that is to say duties that apply to\neverybody. Others (notably Maimonides) adhere to the latter, more\nsupererogatory understanding, holding that such acts are either\nobligatory only for the \u201cpious\u201d few or even not obligatory\nfor anyone (Shilo 1978). This debate regarding the possibility of\nsupererogatory acts reflects the deep underlying problem of the whole\nnormative discourse in Jewish thought, namely is there an independent\nsystem of moral norms and ideals which is not directly derived from\nthe Halakhic, commandment-based, legally binding (and enforceable) law\n(Lichtenstein 1975).\n\nThe hostile attitude of the Reformation to supererogation and the\ndisappearance of the institution of indulgences in the Catholic Church\nled to the rapid decline in the theological and philosophical interest\nin the concept of supererogation in the modern era. However, the great\ntheological debates about actions beyond the call of duty set the\nstage for the contemporary discussion of the subject. The revived\ninterest in supererogation since the 1960s has completely shifted the\nfocus from the theological context to the ethical, but the structure\nof the argumentation is often reminiscent of the traditional Christian\ndebate.\n2. What is Supererogation: Problems of Definition\n\nThe conceptual question of what we mean by supererogation and\nthe substantive question of whether there actually are\nsupererogatory acts (and how their normative value can be justified)\nare inextricably interrelated. Consequently, although the following\ndiscussion will try to separate the two questions, addressing first\nthe conceptual issue and only later the normative, the division is\nonly didactic. Much of the disagreement about the nature of\nsupererogation and its proper definition is informed by normative\nviews about the scope of moral duty, the legitimate expectations of\naltruistic behavior, and the value of the autonomy of the individual\nin pursuing personal goals. This interdependence of the meta-ethical\nand the normative levels of discourse on supererogation becomes\nparticularly evident when paradigm examples are discussed: for\ninstance, is forgiveness obligatory or supererogatory is both a\nconceptual and a normative issue, and the same applies to charity, to\nacts of self-sacrifice and even to toleration, as will be shown\nbelow.\n\nJ.O. Urmson opened the contemporary discussion of supererogation\n(although hardly mentioning the term itself!) by challenging the\ntraditional threefold classification of moral action: the obligatory,\nthe permitted (or indifferent) and the prohibited (Urmson 1958). A\nmore general schema of this classification runs thus (Chisholm\n1963):\n\nactions that are good to do and bad not to do\nactions that are neither good to do nor bad not to do\nactions that are bad to do and good not to do\n\n\nUrmson argued that a morally significant class of actions, to which he\nreferred as saintly and heroic (such as throwing oneself on an\nexploding hand grenade in order to save the lives of others), does not\nfall under any of these categories. He referred to this class as\npraiseworthy though non-obligatory acts, or in terms of the above\ngeneral schema as\n\nactions that are good to do but not bad not to do\n\n\nThe scope of this further category became, however, the focus of\ndebate. Supererogatory acts in Urmson\u2019s sense (which is\nreminiscent of the Catholic doctrine) include only actions that are\nmorally praiseworthy, valuable, although not obligatory in the sense\nthat their omission is not blameworthy. But the general formulation\n(iv) could consist also of small acts of favor, politeness,\nconsideration and tact, which are good though not morally\npraiseworthy, which can be expected of people even though not strictly\ndemanded. The latter, wider, definition of supererogation, covers a\nlarger scope of actions that we tend to view as\ngood-though-not-obligatory; but the former, narrow, definition of\nsupererogation as having a unique moral merit better captures the\nessential value and hence justification of supererogation as a\ndistinct category of moral action, to which Urmson referred as saintly\nand heroic.\n\nThe general schema underlying (iv), i.e. the combination of some\npositive assessment of the action with a non-negative assessment of\nits omission, can be filled in various ways. \u201cGood to do, but\nnot bad not to do\u201d appears to be too weak a definition for\nsupererogation, at least in the sense that some omissions of\nsupererogatory action are (or lead to) bad states of affairs.\n\u201cRight to do, but not wrong not to do\u201d responds to this\nconcern but seems an equally weak definition for supererogatory\naction, this time due to the overly wide characterization of the\npositive condition (e.g. \u201cright\u201d falls short of the proper\ndescription of the act of volunteering to risk one\u2019s life in\norder to save a stranger). \u201cPraiseworthy to do, but not\nblameworthy not to do\u201d seems closer to what we wish to say about\nsupererogatory acts. However, praiseworthiness is associated with the\nevaluation of the agent rather than the act, while supererogation\nrefers primarily to the act. Furthermore, we often praise agents for\ndoing their duty (e.g. in overcoming obstacles like natural fear) and\nwe often do not praise agents of supererogatory action (e.g. when no\nparticular effort, cost, or risk is involved). There is no necessary\nconnection between supererogation and praiseworthiness, as some\nphilosophers argue (Archer 2015). It seems, therefore, that the neat\nschema of deontic logic, comprising of pairs of normative concepts\napplied symmetrically to commission and omission must be broken if we\nhope to arrive at a more useful characterization of supererogation\n(Schumaker 1972). This can be done by either mixing concepts from\ndifferent pairs, such as \u201cgood to do but not wrong not to\ndo,\u201d or by enriching the schema itself by adding further\nconditions, such as the beneficent intentions of the agent and her\naltruistic motives (Heyd 1982, Zimmerman 1996).\n\nDefinitions that are motivated by a skeptical attitude to\nsupererogation often try to salvage the three-fold classification of\nobligation-permission-prohibition as exhausting the realm of moral\nactions. Some philosophers identify supererogation with imperfect\nduty, or with a weak duty, or with duty that is personal and\nnon-universalizable, or with duty that has no correlative right, or\nwith an ethical rather than legal duty, or with an \u201cought\u201d\nwhich is not enforceable. Some even use the oxymoronic term\n\u201csupererogatory duty\u201d in trying to do justice to the\nphenomenon of supererogation without giving up the typically Kantian\nframing of all moral judgments in terms of duty. These are, however,\nmostly unsuccessful attempts. Imperfect duties, as many Kant scholars\nhave noted, are no less compelling than perfect duties and the\ndistinction between perfect and imperfect duty lies only in the mode\nof application (to what degree the conditions of its fulfillment are\nfixed or left to personal choice) rather than in the prescriptive\nforce of the duty itself. And since Kant sometimes defines imperfect\nduties as duties to adopt ends (rather than engage in particular\nacts), supererogation and imperfect duty do not belong to the same\nlevel of discourse: by doing many acts of charity one does not act\nsupererogatorily, since one cannot be more charitable than\nrequired (Guevara 1999, Baron 1987). Furthermore, if supererogation is\na personal (rather than universal) duty, then is it by a subjective\njudgment that it is made to be so? If not, there must be some\n(universalizable) characteristic which lays the duty on this\nkind of individual. Finally, there are many duties that have\nno correlative rights that have nothing to do with supererogation\n(e.g., at least for some philosophers, duties to animals or to future\npeople), so the test of the correlativity of duties to rights cannot\naccount for the distinction between obligation and supererogation.\n\nAnother issue raised by attempts to subject the concept of\nsupererogation to some version of the general schema is that of\n\u201coffence\u201d or \u201csuberogation\u201d: if there are\nnon-obligatory well-doings (supererogation), are there also \u2014 as\ntheir mirror image \u2014 non-prohibited wrong-doings\n(\u201cpermissive ill-doings\u201d)? Or in other words, are\nthere\n\nactions that are bad to do but not good not to do\n\n\nSome philosophers (Chisholm 1963, Richards 1971,\u00a0 Forrester 1975,\nand Driver 1992) were attracted to the logically neat symmetry of\nsupererogation and suberogation, but a critical examination of this\nartificially invented category demonstrates both the difficulty in\nfilling it with content and flaws in the general schema itself (Heyd\n1982, Mellema 1992). Examples for typical \u201coffences\u201d are\nhard to come by. At most one can think of permissible bad action in\nrelatively trivial cases, like taking too long in a restaurant while\nothers are waiting, which is inconsiderate rather than immoral\n(Ullmann-Margalit 2011). These are uninteresting cases from a moral\npoint of view as are their supererogatory counterparts of small favors\nor acts of politeness. An interesting, though controversial, example\nis ingratitude, which is traditionally considered as a grave sin\n(gratitude being a duty), but which some treat as typically\nsuberogatory (Wellman 1999). But once we look for examples of morally\nvicious or villainous action that is nevertheless permissible (which\nis the counterpart of a morally heroic action), we find it difficult\nto come up with an example. This should hardly be surprising. By its\nnature, a moral system does not leave patently bad action as morally\npermissible. In that respect, good and bad, the virtuous and the\nvicious, are not symmetrical from the deontic point of view:\nthe good is open-ended in a way that the bad is not. The extremely\ngood cannot be required, but the extremely bad (vicious) is the prime\ntarget of prohibition. However, more recently Paul McNamara has\nsuggested a rich conceptual analysis of the supererogatory which\nalthough leaving the question of asymmetry open, points to important\nanalogies between the supererogatory and the suberogatory. These can\nbe shown once we switch our attention from the agent-evaluative\ncomponent of suberogation as \u201coffence\u201d to the objective,\nact-evaluative element of \u201cpermissible suboptimality\u201d\n(McNamara 2011).\n\nWider definitions of supererogation, which refer to any\nnon-obligatory good action, are at risk of losing sight of the\nspecifically moral value usually associated with\n\u201cacting beyond the call of duty\u201d or \u201cgoing the\nsecond mile.\u201d Although \u201csupererogatory\u201d in English\nalso means superfluous, the technical Roman-Catholic meaning of the\nconcept is closer to what moral philosophy wishes to highlight as a\nseparate category of action. A typical ethically informed definition\nof supererogation relates both to the element of over-subscription\n(doing literally more than duty requires) and to the high cost or risk\ninvolved in the action (Feinberg 1968). There is a debate whether cost\nto the agent is a necessary condition of supererogation, for some\nminor supererogatory acts do not seem to involve costs, let alone\nrisks. However some cost to the agent, even if marginal, is\npart and parcel of supererogatory behavior, even if the agent enjoys\nengaging in it (Benn 2018b). But risk is not necessarily the source of\nthe value of supererogation. Yet it is true that, unlike\ndefinitions offered by deontic logicians, an ethical definition of\nsupererogation must include a condition that the action be of a\nparticularly moral value. The source of this particular value is\ndouble: the good intended consequences on the one hand, and\nthe optional nature of the act on the other. The good\npromoted is typically of an altruistic nature and thus an act may be\nsupererogatory even if the overall good in the world is not promoted\n(as might be the case in extreme acts of self-sacrifice for the sake\nof another). Supererogatory behavior is typically other-regarding:\neven if there are duties \u201cto oneself\u201d (which many ethical\ntheorists doubt), it is hard to see how they can be transcended in a\nsupererogatory way. In that respect, most definitions of\nsupererogation in modern ethics diverge from the Christian tradition:\nwhereas for the latter paradigm examples of supererogation are piety\nand chastity, for the former these are altruistic deeds of extreme\nbeneficence. There are, however, contemporary non-religious views\nwhich leave room for self-regarding actions of supererogation (Kawall\n2003). \n\nAn illustrative case for this altruistic characterization of\nsupererogation is the understudied issue of whether governments can\nact supererogatorily (for an exception, see Weinberg 2011). Weinberg\nexamines all the possible objections to such a possibility, primarily\nin terms of the government\u2019s exclusive role to implement\njustice, but still wishes to leave the door open for some possible\ngovernmental acts which go beyond duty \u2014 such as throwing a\nblock party or investing money in the preservation of the historical\nlegacy of the nation. But these examples are not intuitively clear\ncases of government supererogation and even if they were, they would\nalways be entangled (as the author admits) with questions of the way\nthe money for these projects was collected and now spent (which is\ntypically a matter of justice). Furthermore, if the definition of\nsupererogatory action consists of a condition of beneficent intention\nor altruism (like in Heyd), governments cannot be considered as agents\nable to show these attitudes. For they are impersonal institutions.\nFor that reason it is dubious whether governments, or other\ninstitutions like the courts, can show forgiveness since their\nfunction is to do justice and promote the good according to the law\nrather than break the rules from an altruistic intention. And of\ncourse it is hard to see how the government can \u201csacrifice\nitself\u201d or its own interests for the sake of another individual\nor state.\n\nAs for the second source of value of supererogatory action, its\noptional nature, it should first be noted that such action must be\nvoluntary (unlike obligatory action, which is often forced or\nenforced). But again, the neutral deontic description of\n\u201cneither obligatory nor forbidden\u201d fails to capture the\nkind of freedom involved in such action. The agent has full discretion\nwhether to go beyond what is required and makes a personal choice to\ndo so. She is neither under any external constraint (like the law),\nnor under internal demands (of rationality or of the Kantian moral\nlaw). In other words, supererogatory behavior is fully optional. Thus,\nit would be absurd to force a person to do a supererogatory act, even\nif that act had extremely beneficial consequences. The permission not\nto do the best we can is not derived from the unenforceability of\nsupererogatory conduct but from agent-centred restrictions which limit\nthe force of the impersonal maximizing principle (Haydar 2002). This\ndoes not mean that the agent herself necessarily believes that her\naction is optional. Many agents of supererogatory acts report that all\nthey did was what they felt they \u201chad to do,\u201d or what they\nthought was their duty (although when asked whether they would expect\nsuch an action to be performed by everybody else in the same\ncircumstances they would probably answer in the negative, thus getting\nentangled in an inconsistency typical of moral modesty).\n\nDoing one\u2019s duty does not win the agent any credit. She only did\nwhat she had to do. But going beyond the call of duty is meritorious\nexactly in the sense that the agent did something \u201cextra,\u201d\nbreaking the balance of justice or that of respect for claim-rights\nand the fulfillment of duties. This merit of supererogatory action\nshould be held distinct from the praise we often assign to the agent.\nPraise is a subjective assessment or recognition of the particular way\nin which the agent faced a moral challenge and acted as she did (e.g.\novercoming special difficulties or obstacles, or sacrificing herself\nin the course of doing either what was her duty or what lay beyond\nit). Merit is an objective property of the act itself. It is typically\nattached to heroic and saintly acts, but it can also be gained by\nminor supererogatory acts of kindness or gifts, and is thus not\nnecessarily associated with particular praise for the agent (cf.\nMontague 1989, Trianosky 1986). Recent works on supererogation refer\nto \u201cmoral-merit-conferring reasons\u201d for action, i.e.\nreasons which are neither \u201crequiring\u201d nor\n\u201cjustifying\u201d as a way to untie \u201cthe knot\u201d (or\nalleged paradox) of supererogation (Horgan and Timmons 2010, Dreier\n2004). But unlike the Catholic doctrine, few theorists of\nsupererogation believe that this merit is transferable or can serve as\ncompensation for other people\u2019s moral failures. And although\nsupererogation cannot be hoped to simply offset even one\u2019s\nown violations of duty, the merit of actions beyond the call\nof duty definitely plays an important role in the overall evaluation\nof one\u2019s moral record. In cases of a high potential benefit we\nmay sometimes even be permitted to act supererogatorily rather than do\nour duty (Kamm 1985). Furthermore, the traditional idea of merit (or\n\u201csuperabundance\u201d) associated with supererogation is\nreflected in secular ethical theory in the duty of gratitude:\nacknowledging the meritorious nature of a gift or any non-obligatory\nwell doing is the morally obligatory response (irrespective of the\nmoral praise which might or might not accrue to the agent of the\nsupererogatory act).\n\nThe characterization of supererogatory acts is highly controversial\nand cannot be captured by a strict formal definition. Furthermore, as\nhas already come up in the discussion in this section, the way we\ndescribe supererogation is closely dependent on the way we justify (or\ndeny) its moral value. Most typically, definitions of supererogation\nthat introduce conditions of altruistic intention, free choice and\ngood consequences are constructed in a way that betrays an underlying\nview about its special moral value and hence justification. On the\nother hand, definitions that are merely formal (deontic) in nature are\nnot committed to the intrinsic value, indeed to the very existence of\nsupererogatory actions.\n3. Three Views of Supererogation: Problems of Justification\n\nThe modern debate whether there actually are supererogatory acts has\nlost its traditional fervor typical of the great religious disputes\nbetween Catholics and Reformers in the 16th and\n17th centuries. One reason is that there are no direct\npolitical or institutional stakes involved in the contemporary\ndiscussions, such as Church power in granting indulgences (although\nthere is a supererogatory dimension in the contemporary idea of Truth\nand Reconciliation Commissions). Yet, the issue between\nsupererogationists, as they are often called, and their opponents\nstill runs deep and involves the general relationship between the\n\u201cgood\u201d and the \u201cought\u201d.\n\nThe views about the possibility and value of supererogatory acts can\nbe grouped under three categories:\n\nAnti-supererogationism: since all morally good action is\nobligatory, there cannot be a separate class of morally good action\nthe omission of which is not wrong.\nQualified supererogationism: there are actions which lie beyond\nthe call of duty, but their value is derived from their being\nhypothetical duties, subjective duties, duties from which one may be\nexcused, that is, duties in a weaker sense.\nUnqualified supererogationism: supererogatory actions lie entirely\nand without qualification beyond the requirements of morality and that\nis the source of their unique value.\n\n\nLike any classification, this one is somewhat artificial and\narbitrary. Some particular views of supererogation cannot be easily\nand neatly subsumed under one of its categories. The distinction\nbetween (1) and (2) hinges on the nature of the relevant\n\u201cqualification\u201d: even the rigorous deniers of\nsupererogation are willing to accept some form of excuse for not\nengaging in particularly difficult or demanding moral action, and\nqualified supererogationists may often admit that a heroic action is\nobligatory even if it is unrealistic for society to expect individuals\nto perform it. The borderline between (2) and (3) is also often vague,\nsince when one tries to explain what makes a class of actions\nsupererogatory, in the unqualified sense of being fully optional, one\nis often drawn back to the difficulty or risk in performing it, to the\nparticular personal virtue required to do so, or in general terms to\ncertain qualifying conditions which justify leaving them beyond the\ndemands of morality.\n\nThe three views of supererogation are three responses to the\n\u201cparadox of supererogation,\u201d namely how can the moral good\nnot be required as a duty. The first view recognizes the paradox and\naddresses it by denying the very possibility of supererogation; the\nsecond resolves what it sees as an apparent paradox by explaining the\nconditions under which duty loses its prescriptive force; the third\nview denies that there is in the first place any paradox in the gap\nbetween the \u201cgood\u201d and the \u201cought,\u201d thus\nleaving room for an independent category of supererogation.\n3.1 Anti-supererogationism\n\nThe denial of supererogation is basically associated with the\nrejection of the idea of the two faces of morality. Normativity is one\nand cannot be split into two levels, that of the good (the desirable,\nthe ideal, the recommended) and that of the required (the obligatory,\nthe prescribed). What \u201cought to be the case\u201d also\n\u201cought to be done.\u201d A possible good state of\naffairs creates a reason for action. Furthermore, the fact that human\nbeings, due to their limitations and flawed character, often fail to\nlive up to the standards of the ideally good behavior is a deplorable\nfact that does not undermine the normative power of the moral\ndemands.\n\nThis \u201cgood-ought tie-up\u201d is a theoretically attractive\nprinciple: whatever is good, ought to be done. If an action is good,\nthen there must be reasons for doing it. If it is the best possible\naction, the reasons for doing it are conclusive, that is outweighing\nall other reasons for not doing it (or doing something else). Failing\nto do the best action cannot therefore be immune from blame or\ncondemnation. Or, in other words, doing the best is always obligatory,\nnever optional. Supererogation is impossible (Moore 1948, New 1974,\nFeldman 1986, Pybus 1982).\n\nThe principled denial of supererogation was central in the theological\nconception of Lutherans and Calvinists. The demands of God are so\nextensive that human beings have not the slightest chance of ever\nsatisfying them, let alone going beyond them. But there are also\nnon-theological adherents to this idea of the\n\u201ctotalitarian\u201d dominion of duty. Kantian ethics is based\non the general idea of an all-encompassing moral law and\nconceives of duty as the only expression of moral value in human\naction. Universalizability of the maxim of action and acting from the\nsense of duty (or respect for the law) as a motive are two\nconstitutive hallmarks of moral action according to Kant. But the two\nare incompatible with the nature of supererogatory action, which is\noptional and personal on the one hand and not motivated by the\nsubjection to the moral law on the other. Classical utilitarianism may\nalso be interpreted as denying any space for supererogation. If\npromoting the overall good in the world is the fundamental principle\nof action, there can be no (non-utilitarian) exemption from the duty\nto do so. Both Kantians and utilitarians are highly suspicious of acts\nof great personal self-sacrifice (typical of some paradigm examples of\nsupererogation). For Kant they may reflect moral self-indulgence and\nvanity unbound by the moral law or even be a violation of one\u2019s\nduties to oneself (Kant 1949, Timmermann 2005). For utilitarians such\nacts may end up decreasing the overall happiness in the world (since\nthe loss to the agent could outweigh the gain for the beneficiary,\neither in the specific individual case, or when adopted as a general\nrule of behavior). It should, however, be noted that there are serious\nattempts to interpret Kant\u2019s theory as leaving some room for\nsupererogation (Hill 1971, Eisenberg 1966, Heyd 1983) and there are\nutilitarians like Mill who specifically hail the value of\nnon-obligatory meritorious action (Mill 1969). Furthermore, the idea\nof \u201csatisficing\u201d (rather than optimizing or maximizing),\ni.e. aiming at the good enough rather than at the best, is a\ncontemporary version of utilitarianism which leaves ample room for\nsupererogation (Slote 1989, Vessel 2010).\n\nThe denial of the value of supererogatory action also appeals to its\nincompatibility with the fundamental requirement of impartiality.\nActions beyond the call of duty are not expected of everybody on an\nequal basis and are not bestowed on everybody in an impartial way. In\nother words, there are no general rules regarding either the\nagent or the recipient of supererogatory conduct. Thus, no general\nspecification as to who deserves or is entitled to be the recipient of\nsupererogatory giving can be formulated, and those who, for instance,\nare not given charity cannot complain for being discriminated against.\nFurthermore, some philosophers have noted (Wolf 1982) that despite the\ntraditional aura associated with saintly action, \u201cmoral\nsaints\u201d are not very attractive human characters and most of us\ndo not take them as role models for the way we lead our lives. They\nare fanatically one-track minded in their pursuit of moral ideals,\ntending to disparage the more personal (non-moral) values which we\ntend to appreciate in ourselves and in others (such as achieving\nathletic excellence or dedicating one\u2019s life to music). We feel\nsimilar repugnance towards a person who always goes beyond her duty as\nwe feel towards the person who never does anything beyond what is\nstrictly required of her.\n\nDespite its theoretical and moral purity, the anti-supererogationist\nview is open to criticism. The good-ought tie-up rests on an ambiguity\nin the concept of ought, which may be interpreted either in a\ncommendatory sense or in a prescriptive sense. \u201cYou ought to see\nthe current Caravaggio exhibition\u201d provides one with a\nreason for action, an advice, a recommendation that is not binding.\n\u201cYou ought to attend the next faculty meeting\u201d may be a\nconclusive reason for action, a prescription. To further\ncomplicate matters, \u201cought\u201d is often used impersonally, as\nin \u201cit ought to be nice weather for our picnic tomorrow,\u201d\nbut also personally, as in \u201cyou ought to buy wine for the\npicnic.\u201d And \u201cthe picnic ought to have been better\norganized\u201d lies between the personal and the impersonal senses\nof \u201cought,\u201d referring to some unspecified agent\nwithout addressing a prescription to any particular individual.\n\nThe good-ought tie-up works for the commendatory use of\n\u201cought\u201d as well as for the impersonal, but not for the\nprescriptive and personal. \u201cOught\u201d in the personal sense\ninvolves human agency as well as personal responsibility. Laying a\nduty on an individual requires both having a particularly strong (not\njust a) reason and showing how the reason is related to the\nparticular agent. Just being a good state of affairs (even the best)\ndoes not create a reason for x to bring it about. X must\nstand in a particular position to the desirable state of affairs to\nmake her have a (conclusive) reason to bring it about. Once the\ngood-ought tie-up is broken in those central prescriptive contexts of\npersonal \u201cought,\u201d anti-supererogationism loses much of its\nbite. Supererogation is exactly what one does not personally have to\ndo, even if it either ought to be done by someone or would\nlead to a state of affairs which \u201cought to exist.\u201d However\nit remains for the supererogationist view to explain why the personal\nought does not extend to the whole scope of the good.\n3.2 Qualified Supererogationism\n\nCompletely denying the existence and value of supererogatory action\ndoes not fit with most people\u2019s intuitions. One way to account\nfor supererogation without giving up the moral and theoretical\nprinciple relating the \u2018good\u2019 to the \u2018ought\u2019,\nvalue to duty, is to distinguish between different kinds of duties and\nobligations or to specify conditions and limits of the application of\nduties. Supererogation is a legitimate class of moral action but only\nin a qualified sense, i.e. due to certain conditions that make the\nmoral \u2018ought\u2019 inapplicable or not fully prescriptive. This\nintermediate position seems to be the most common in the literature on\nsupererogation, but it has many forms and variations.\n\nAccounts of supererogation belonging to this group typically appeal to\nthe linguistic hybrid \u201csupererogatory requirements\u201d or\neven \u201csupererogatory duties.\u201d Thus, for instance, contract\ntheorists (Richards 1971) describe principles of supererogation as\nthose that ideal contractors in the original position would consent\nnot to enforce in society. Supererogatory behavior is a\nrequirement, but punishing those who do not fulfill the requirement\nwould be too costly in terms of the relative pain incurred to the\nagent as against the benefit to the potential beneficiary. Failure to\nact supererogatorily is blameworthy and wrong, but lends itself only\nto informal criticism rather than to institutionalized sanction.\nSupererogation is justified only in qualified, circumstantial terms\nrelating to the limited effectiveness of its enforcement. It has no\nintrinsic value. The idea of \u2018Forced supererogation\u2019\nbelongs to this kind of account: there are actions which are\npraiseworthy and although their omission not blameworthy it is plainly\nwrong not to do them (Cohen 2013).\n\nAnother line of justifying supererogation without relinquishing the\nprinciple of \u2018good\u2019-entails-\u2018ought\u2019 goes back\nto Thomas Aquinas but has some contemporary followers who sometimes\nspeak in terms of vocation. Supererogatory behavior is\nrequired, but not of everybody. It can be expected only from\nthose who subjectively feel the commitment to do it or from those who\nare objectively blessed with the necessary strength of character and\nvirtue. Unlike the previous view, which distinguished between duty and\nsupererogation in terms of the overall costs of enforcing duty, this\napproach is based on a principle of excuse: most human\nbeings, due to their frail moral nature and imperfection are excused\nfrom omitting what from an ideal (religious, ethical) point of view is\nprescribed as a duty. The problem with this excused-based view of\nsupererogation is that it is either subjectivist (the individual\nchooses her duties) or aristocratic (distinguishing between classes of\nmoral agents). Furthermore, it fails to distinguish between the common\nappeals to excuses from obligatory action based on the particular\ndifficulty or risk involved in its performance and the general\nexemption from supererogatory action that is sometimes easy and\npossible for everybody (like doing a small favor or showing\nforgiveness). Rawls\u2019 analysis of supererogation also appeals to\nan argument from exemption: \u201cSupererogatory acts are not\nrequired, though normally they would be were it not for the loss or\nrisk involved for the agent himself. A person who does a\nsupererogatory act does not invoke the exemption which the natural\nduties allow\u201d (Rawls 1971, p. 117).\n\nA structurally similar analysis of supererogation is offered in terms\nof reasons for action. We may have a good (even a conclusive) reason\nto act in a certain way, but also a second-order permission not to act\non that good reason. This permission, called\n\u201cexclusionary,\u201d is based on a second-order reason and\nallows the agent to disregard the balance of first order reasons for\naction. An agent acts supererogatorily if despite the permission to\nignore these reasons, decides to act on them (Raz 1975). Typically,\nother-regarding considerations such as promoting the overall good\nserve as the kind of first-order conclusive reasons for an action\n(making it prima facie obligatory), whereas self-regarding\nconsiderations of the individual\u2019s autonomy to pursue her own\ngoals in life support the second-order permission not to engage in\nthat action. Self-sacrifice is again a paradigm example of\nsupererogation. Although personal autonomy is not strictly speaking an\nexcuse, it creates a kind of exemption from doing the morally\nrequired act. But the autonomy of the individual cannot serve to break\nthe good-ought tie-up, since it presupposes the independent\nvalue of the personal good from what ought to be done rather than\nestablish it (Dancy 1988). Furthermore, supererogationists of the\nunqualified kind would resist this exemption-based analysis as playing\ndown the positive moral value of supererogation and relegating it to\nthe morally neutral category of the \u201cpermitted\u201d (Heyd\n1992).\n\nThere is an interesting suggestion that supererogatory action is\ngrounded in moral reasons which are opposed by rational reasons of a\nnonmoral kind (Portmore 2003, Portmore 2008). Thus, I have a perfectly\ngood moral reason to help an AIDS stricken community, but such a\nchoice would, all things considered, be irrational due to the risk to\nmy life and health or to the loss in achieving personal projects with\nwhich I identify. Thus, nonmoral reasons can prevent moral reasons\nfrom having a morally requiring force. Theoretically this\nanalysis opens a wide gap between rationality and morality which\nphilosophers are reluctant to accept. Moral requirements according to\nthis view have force only when they are backed not only by direct\nmoral reasons but also by the entire scheme of reasons by which I make\npractical choices and these might point to a conclusive reason not to\nact morally. \"Supererogatory actions just are those that are morally\ngood, but for which one does not have decisive practical reason\"\n(Dorsey 2013, pp. 381-2). Critics of this approach have pointed out\nthat first, not all supererogatory action is irrational and secondly,\na moral theory which encourages us to perform irrational action is\ndefective (Postow 2005). But note that this critique implies a\nqualified form of supererogationism since the only way to explain why\nwe are free not to act on the best reason overall is that we are\nexcused or exempted from the action supported by the set of moral\nand rational reasons.\n\nQualified versions of supererogationism try to salvage a prescriptive\nelement in the analysis of the concept without collapsing\nsupererogation into duty (which would amount to denying its separate\nexistence). Identifying supererogation with a weaker kind of duty, an\nimperfect duty, a non-universalizable duty, an \u2018ought\u2019\nrather than a duty are all forms of recognition of supererogatory acts\nbut only as being an integral part of an overall conception of duty.\nThey maintain the deontic integrity of the moral system but by that\nrun the risk of losing sight of what makes supererogatory action\nuniquely meritorious, sometimes praiseworthy, and often touching.\n3.3 Unqualified Supererogationism\n\nImagine a world in which all morally good acts are also obligatory and\nin which individuals are capable of carrying out their duties with\nease (and with no conflict with their personal goals and aims). Is\nsomething of moral value missing in such a world? Both\nanti-supererogationists and qualified supererogationists would answer\nin the negative. Those who believe in the intrinsic value of\nsupererogatory conduct would disagree. What would be missing in such a\nworld is what Tertullian referred to as licentia, that\nspecial field of liberty, which allows human beings to exercise their\npower of moral choice. Even Kant, who suggests the ideal of the\nKingdom of Ends in which members of the moral community exercise their\nfree will (Wille) by the necessity of their nature, believes that\nimperfect moral creatures like us have a free choice (Willk\u00fcr)\nbetween good and evil. In this discretionary power to adopt the moral\nlaw (or reject it) lies the particular value of morality, at least for\nhuman beings. Going beyond duty might be considered as a display of\nthis power of free choice. The pure or unqualified version of\nsupererogationism highlights the moral potential of good human action\nnot prescribed or commanded, imposed or demanded in any sense. In\nother words, supererogation is good, not only due to the promotion of\noverall value in the world (which would not be denied by the other two\nviews either), but also due to the kind of liberty in which it is\nperformed. If that is the case, then an inherent part of the value of\nsupererogation lies exactly in its lying beyond duty. The\nsupererogatory is something that is not required in any sense and its\nomission does not call for an appeal to a special permission,\nexemption or excuse.\n\nRather than argue that a supererogatory act is that which the agent is\npermitted not to do, the unqualified analysis argues that it\nis an option for the agent. Permissions, at least\n\u201cstrong permissions,\u201d are given to people to act in a way\nwhich there is some reason not to, whereas options are the positive\ncounterparts of permissions. Options, as the etymology of the term\nattests, are actions the agent wishes to do, actions that\nseem to him good and worthy of choice. The point of supererogatory\naction lies, accordingly, in the good will of the agent, in his\naltruistic intention, in his choice to exercise generosity or to show\nforgiveness, to sacrifice himself or to do a little uncalled favor,\nrather than strictly adhering to his duty. Supererogatory action is a\nmatter of personal initiative; it is spontaneous (i.e. originating in\npersonal choice rather than in any external or universal demands). It\nallows for the expression of personal care or concern for another\nindividual and thus may either reflect a particular personal\nrelationship to another or create such a relationship. Supererogation\nis valuable because we believe that beyond the impersonal and\negalitarian social web created by the universal morality of duty,\nthere is space left for particular relationships that are not governed\nby the principles of justice and rights. From society\u2019s point of\nview, leaving a separate space for supererogatory action may\nstrengthen mutual trust and communal bonds since it often indicates\nand promotes love and personal concern rather than mere respect for\npersons and a sense of justice. This view of supererogation locates it\nin the open-ended dimension of morality, that of ideals rather than\nprinciples, what Urmson calls \u201cthe higher flights of\nmorality\u201d and Bergson \u201cthe morality of aspiration.\u201d\nThe Talmud suggests this idea epigrammatically: \u201cJerusalem was\nonly destroyed because judgments were given strictly upon Biblical Law\nand did not go beyond the requirements of the law\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, supererogation is closely related to the ideal of moral\nperfection. For the anti-supererogationist we are under a duty to do\nthe very best, to be perfect. But this may be a demand with which\npeople would not be always able to comply but a counter-productive\nexpectation which would lead to despair and constant fear of failure\n(Benn 2018a). Allowing space for the supererogatory enables human\nbeings to try to go beyond the required and towards perfection without\na sense of guilt and failure.\n\nThe justification of a principled (rather than pragmatic or\ncircumstantial) demarcation between duty and supererogation is\nreminiscent of the analogous demarcation between the legal and the\nmoral. Beyond the obvious reasons for avoiding the legal enforcement\nof all moral duties, many philosophers believe that part of the value\nof acting on one\u2019s moral duty has to do with the intention to do\nthe right act, with acting for duty\u2019s sake. This serves as a\nprincipled ground for leaving morality free from legal enforcement.\nSimilarly, unqualified supererogationists argue that the value of some\nvirtuous actions like giving and forgiving would be lost if these\nbecome morally obligatory, demands whose omission entails blame and\ncondemnation. The optional nature of supererogatory behavior is one\nstep beyond the Kantian-like freedom of acting from moral duty. The\nmoral non-enforcement of the supererogatory is analogous to the legal\nnon-enforcement of the moral.\n\nAll this leaves the question of the substantive demarcation of duty\nand supererogation unsettled. Those who deny the existence of\nsupererogation are not bothered by the issue. Those who explain it in\nterms of exemptions and excuses can appeal to cost-benefit analyses of\nthe enforcement of high standards of behavior on morally weak human\nbeings. But for those who ground supererogation in the intrinsic value\nof individual autonomy and altruistic intention, personal concern and\nthe expression of virtue, there are no easy criteria for establishing\nthe limits of duty and the space of the supererogatory. One method of\ndrawing this line is phenomenological, that is to say to proceed from\n\u201cthe inside of the agent\u201d and her experience which attests\nto the difference between the sense of external requirement and the\nfree choice of the individual (Horgan and Timmons 2010). However\nadvocates of this method are fully aware that it can at most serve as\nan empirical support to the possibility of supererogation, but not as\nits philosophical justification.\n\nThe recent renewal of interest in virtue ethics led philosophers to\nexamine whether there is a place for supererogation in such\nvirtue-based theories. On the face of it, Aristotelian ethics cannot\naccommodate supererogation since it does not share the deontic\nconditions on which the idea of transcending duty is based. However,\nRoger Crisp argues that this view is based on a misreading of\nAristotle, for whom both doing the virtuous act (fitting the\ncircumstances) and being a virtuous person are obligatory. It is the\nduty of a virtuous person to become angry when it is fitting to feel\nso. Thus, Crisp is led to a sharp anti-supererogationist view. Since\nvirtue is itself a kind of excess, one cannot go beyond it (Crisp\n2013). But then, one may wonder, how would Aristotle (according to\nCrisp\u2019s reading) evaluate the act of throwing oneself on a\nhand-grenade in order to save the lives of others? Aristotle should\neither judge it as plainly wrong, wasteful or unfitting (and hence\ncontrary to duty), or as \u201ca noble\u201d deed which is\nultimately self-serving, adding glory to the agent, even if only\nposthumously. This understanding of virtue ethics is extremely\ndemanding in comparison to theories which recognize the separate realm\nof the supererogatory. However, there are proponents of virtue ethics\nwho believe that supererogation is not only possible but can be\nanalyzed in Aristotelian terms (Stangl 2016).\n\nIt should be noted that in virtue-based ethics (for example\nAristotle\u2019s) the demarcation issue becomes moot: supererogatory\ntranscendence of the demands of morality does not play a major role\nsince ethical norms do not consist of well-defined moral duties with\nwhich supererogation is correlated. There are contemporary attempts to\nanalyze supererogation in terms of virtue (Kawall 2009), but they seem\nto fall into circularity: if the supererogatory is defined as what the\n(idealized) perfectly virtuous person would judge to be so, we still\nhave to decide, independently of a theory of supererogation, who this\nideal moral agent is. The ideal of virtue is therefore not very\nhelpful in providing us with criteria for supererogation and for its\ndemarcation from duty.\n\nThirty years after publishing his ground-breaking article\n\u201cSaints and Heroes\u201d, J. O. Urmson (1988) expressed regret\nfor having introduced the theological term\n\u201csupererogation\u201d into moral philosophy since he reached\nthe conclusion that it only replaced \u201cthe old over-simple\ntrichotomy\u201d with \u201ca new over-simple tetrachotomy\u201d.\nThis change of heart for the philosopher most associated with the\nmodern revival of the debate on supererogation is striking. His late\nview cannot, however, be categorized as anti-supererogationist since\nhe does not deny the special moral value of saintly and heroic actions\nwhich are by no way obligatory. Yet, he wishes \u201cto\ndissociate\u201d himself from using the concept of supererogation as\na \u201cblanket-term\u201d which covers both saintly and heroic acts\nand acts of considerateness, decency, chivalry and self-denial. Urmson\nbelieves that these kinds of actions are too heterogeneous to be\ntreated under a distinct category in moral theory. The response to\nUrmson\u2019s (self) critique is that the less dramatic cases of\n\u201cnon-obligatory well doings\u201d are a significant challenge\nto deontological theory no less than the rare acts of extraordinary\nsacrifice and altruism. At least this seems to be the assumption in\nmost of the literature on the subject following Urmson\u2019s\nretraction.\n\nThere is no knockout argument for any of the three views of\nsupererogation. The relative merits and defects in each have to do\nwith the kind of definition of the supererogatory as well as with some\nfundamental beliefs about the nature of morality and the source of\nmoral value. However, a more \u201clocal,\u201d less abstract,\ndiscussion of paradigm examples of supererogatory action may be of\nhelp in the overall assessment of the three views.\n4. Paradigm Examples\n\nThe analysis of concrete cases or examples is methodologically\nimportant in the philosophical discussion of supererogation. Unlike\nother subjects in ethics, like justice or duty, in which there is wide\nagreement about some core cases, supererogation is a concept the\napplicability of which is controversial. Unlike the concepts of\njustice and duty, which have deep roots in both ordinary language and\neveryday moral judgment, the idea of supererogation is only tenuously\nanchored in common moral discourse and the concept itself is a\ntheoretical construct. Examples cannot in themselves prove the truth\nof any of the previously discussed analyses of supererogation, but\nthey can definitely help in revising the various definitions of the\nconcept as well as make a case for one or another of its\njustifications. Admittedly, some measure of circularity is inevitable\nin such a method, since the way examples are understood and analyzed\nis also informed by the definition and the construction of the\ntheoretical concept.\n\nBeneficence and charity are often considered as typical examples of\nsupererogation. Unlike giving what is the recipient\u2019s\ndue (or what is owed to him as his right), charity is not\nrequired by justice, lies beyond one\u2019s duty. As the term\n\u201cgratuity\u201d indicates, it is not necessary but optional.\nCharity is typically open-ended (i.e. there is no specified limit to\nhow much one may give), is driven by altruistic intention, and is\njudged to be morally praiseworthy in a different sense than the\nfulfillment of a duty or respect for others\u2019 rights. But\nanti-supererogationists hold a harsher view of charity. Some regard\ncharity as a condescending attitude; others expose the underlying\nexpectation of return involved in any system of gifts (Mauss 1954) or\neven the logical impossibility of a real, free and gratuitous gift\nrelationship, since every giving involves an expectation of return\n\u2014 of both gratitude and a future gift (Derrida 1992). There are\nethical theorists who believe that our standards of distributive\njustice are far too minimalist and that much of what is considered\nsupererogatory in the transference of wealth from the rich to the poor\nshould really be considered obligatory. The more extreme version of\nthis critique suggests a principle of giving according to which one\nshould give all one\u2019s luxuries in order to satisfy the basic\nneeds of others. Thus, the realm of the supererogatory is radically\nnarrowed down, although it is hard to see how anti-supererogationists\ncan completely abolish it. Supererogationists for their part argue\nthat some distinction between justice and charity, between market\nexchange and voluntary giving, is good for both society and\nindividuals because it creates a sense of community and good will, not\nto speak of more utilitarian benefits. One classical example is the\nsystem of the provision of blood for medical purposes. Social\nscientists as well as philosophers have argued for the advantages of a\ncompletely voluntary (supererogatory) system of blood donation over\nthe commercialized or \u201cenforced\u201d systems (Titmuss 1973).\nBut it seems that the issue of the deontic status of charity is often\nof a normative rather than conceptual kind. It focuses on the\ndemarcation line between the obligatory and the gratuitous, both on\nthe personal level of the behavior of the individual and on the social\nand political level (e.g. how much do rich countries owe poor\ncountries and how much should be left to voluntary charity).\n\nThe problem of demarcation also plagues the paradigm case of\nsupererogatory behavior, the so-called saintly and heroic acts. Fire\nfighters rushing to a burning house to save its residents risk their\nlives in a way that moves every spectator. But are they not paid for\nit? Is it not \u201ctheir job\u201d? Are they not justified when in\na later response to a journalist\u2019s question they insist that\nthey only did their duty? The supererogationist might respond by\nturning our attention to a similar risk taken by a by-stander who\njoins the professional emergency forces and literally jumps into the\nfire. Deniers of supererogation might argue that although such an\naction is heroic, it ought not to have been performed, since the\nslight chances of saving the victims of the fire do not justify the\nvery high risk of loss of life of the volunteer. Kant at one point\nexpresses his doubts about the moral motive behind some of the extreme\ncases of moral heroism and warns against moral fanaticism and\nsentimentalism (Kant 1949).\n\nThere are however examples of morally good actions which can be denied\na supererogatory status only with much difficulty. Volunteering is a\ntypical act that cannot be reduced to a duty, even not in a\nhypothetical manner as qualified supererogationism might try to do.\nWhen a job or a task must be done by a group of people, the group\nmight select the individual who will do the job on the basis of some\nprinciple of justice or desert or, in the absence of such principle,\nby lot. In extreme cases, such as taking part in a highly risky\nmedical experiment, it may be the case that no selection process,\nincluding lottery, should be deployed. If an individual volunteers to\ntake upon herself the task rather than leaving it to the selected\nperson, and particularly when it is wrong to select anyone,\nthen clearly her act is supererogatory. Volunteering highlights the\noptional nature of supererogatory action in its purest form (the agent\ncan hardly hide behind the morally modest expression \u201cI only did\nmy duty\u201d). Promising is similar to volunteering in its optional\nnature which is not associated with the demarcation problem. One ought\nto fulfill one\u2019s promises, but making them in the first place is\nsupererogatory. This might solve a paradox which has been raised: is a\npromise to do a supererogatory act possible? It seems not, since the\npromise fulfilling act cannot be both an obligatory act of promise\nkeeping and a supererogatory act at the same time (Kawall, 2005). This\nmay lead us to the conclusion that it is impossible to promise to do a\nsupererogatory act since no act can secure the bare minimum of the\nobligation created by the promise maker: only a supererogatory act\nwould be considered as promise fulfilling and such an act is by\ndefinition not obligatory (Benn 2014). However, if the act of\npromising itself is supererogatory, then so is its fulfillment, even\nthough the expectation created by the promise means that after being\nmade it must be fulfilled. The paradox may prove to be illusory once\nwe distinguish between the general supererogatory nature of the\ncontent of the act (e.g. giving you a ride to the airport in the\nmiddle of the night) and the obligatory nature of its performance\nunder the specific circumstances of having promised to do so (Heyd\n2005). \n\nOf course, anti-supererogationists could argue that volunteering and\npromising are both imperfect duties, i.e. not obligatory in any given\nindividual case but nevertheless general requirements of virtue.\nPeople who never volunteer are morally condemnable; people who never\ncommit themselves by promising are morally defective and fall short of\nstandards of friendship and social behavior.\n\nThere are cases in which the supererogatory response is expressed in\nomission rather than in action. Forgiveness is a prime example of\nsupererogatory forbearance. The offended party refrains from reacting\nnegatively to the wrong done to him. Rather than the morally justified\nhostility and resentment that he was entitled to express, he shows\nforgiveness. There is, however a heated debate in ethical theory about\nthe deontic nature of forgiveness. Many philosophers and\nnon-philosophers alike believe that forgiveness is a moral\nduty, particularly if certain conditions like expressions of\nregret by the offender have been satisfied (e.g. Rashdall 1924). An\nunforgiving person is, accordingly, morally blameworthy. But for\nothers, forgiveness is the epitome of supererogatory action since it\nis completely gratuitous, dependent on the good will of the offended\nparty (Heyd 1982). There is also a middle way (Gamlund 2010) which\nconsiders \u201cunconditional forgiveness\u201d (that which is shown\nto unrepenting wrongdoers) as typically supererogatory, but\n\u201cconditional forgiveness\u201d (granted to offenders who\nexpress regret) as possibly a duty (depending on other\nconsiderations). For supererogationists the touching aspect of\nforgiveness lies exactly in its optional nature. Since the offender\ndeserves punishment (or at least resentment), he cannot at the same\ntime deserve (or have the right to) forgiveness. Despite the close\nsimilarity between giving and forgiving, it seems that the latter is a\npurer example of supererogatory act since it has a better chance of\nbreaking what Derrida refers to as an endless circle: while a gift\nimposes a duty (debt) which can be satisfied only by a slightly larger\ncounter-gift (which would initiate yet another round of giving),\nforgiveness is more a matter of attitude and has no measure.\n\nIt has also been suggested that toleration is, like forgiveness, an\nact of supererogatory forbearance: although the tolerator has a good\nreason for intervening in the wrong behavior of another, she chooses\nto refrain from such interference, letting the other lead her life as\nshe wants (Newey 1997, Benbaji & Heyd 2001). Thus, an analysis of\ntoleration as supererogatory is a possible solution of the\n\u201cparadox of toleration,\u201d viz. how can refraining from\nintervening in the wrong beliefs or behavior of others be considered\ndesirable. Note, though, that if toleration is taken as as\nsupererogatory, it cannot, for the reasons discussed above, be\nascribed to governments but only to individuals and groups of\nindividuals.\n\nHowever, even if certain acts of forgiveness and toleration exemplify\na supererogatory response, there surely are cases in which both are\nforbidden (the unforgivable and the intolerable) and there may be\ncases in which they are both obligatory (persistent pleas of the\noffender to be forgiven or the political demands of toleration of\nminorities in a multi-cultural society). A conceptually neat case for\ntesting our intuitions about the deontic status of forgiveness (and\ntoleration) is God\u2019s attitude to human sinners: is God\nbound by the principles of just retribution, i.e. not to\nforgive? Does he have a duty to forgive? Or is divine forgiveness a\npure act of gratuitous grace? If God can act supererogatorily, how\ndoes that reflect on the perfection of divine justice that it\ntranscends? The application of the concepts of forgiveness on the\npolitical level raise further questions. Even if the universal and\nunbiased rules of justice can be surpassed by individuals who show\nforgiveness or toleration, can institutions like the state or the\ncourts exercise such supererogatory restraint without violating the\ndemands of impartiality and equality before the law (Heyd 1978)? Legal\npardon granted by kings and presidents reflects this tension between\nthe wish to leave some measure of individual discretion in showing\nmercy to some public figures and the concern for the impartial\napplication of such supererogatory grace.\n\nThere are of course many other examples of supererogatory action\nalthough the length and nature of the list is dependent on the\ndefinition of supererogation we adopt and the view of its value. But\nto the extent that actions and forbearances are supererogatory we may\nsummarize their source of value as belonging either to their good\nconsequences (as in the case of giving and charity) or to the strength\nof character or virtue of the agent (as in the risky acts of heroism)\nor to the pure good will involved in choosing to do what lies beyond\nduty (volunteering, forgiveness, small favors).\n\nBeyond the complex philosophical debate about the nature and scope of\nsupererogation, the discussion of paradigm examples indicate that any\nethical system which does not allow for any actions beyond the call of\nduty would prove to be distressingly impoverished, even if\ncoherent.\n5. Complications and Extensions\n\nAs early as 1982 Derek Parfit raised the following question: imagine\nthat you can save the right arm of another person at a great cost to\nyourself; but if you decide to do so, you can save also his left arm\nat no extra cost to you; are you under a duty to save both\narms? Parfit\u2019s answer is the intuitive one: yes, you ought to do\nso (Parfit 1982, pp. 131-2). Yet this answer does not easily fit\ntheories of supererogation according to which if saving one arm is\nsupererogatory, saving two arms must a fortiori be\nsupererogatory. This question gave rise to more recent debates about\n\"Effective Altruism\". The idea is that even if there is no duty to\ngive to charity, it is wrong to give to a charity which is\nineffective; or in other words, once the bounds of duty are crossed\nand one\u2019s action is supererogatory, it ought to be optimal,\nespecially if the extra costs and risks are only marginal or\nnon-existent (Pummer 2016). If two children are stranded in a burning\nhouse and you risk your life by entering the house and save one child,\nyou ought to save also the other child if that does not incur further\nrisk to you. The two children have no claim on you as long as you\nstand outside just doing what your duty demands (calling the fire\nfighters); but once you are inside, the second child has a claim on\nyou to be saved too. The same justification not to save a child from a\nburning house (the extreme risk) must apply to both children. But once\nyou are inside the house and have already risked your life, this\njustification does not work if you choose not to save the other\n(Horton 2017). Against this demand for optimization (limited only by\nagent-relative qualifications) there is the unqualified,\nnon-consequentialist argument that one needs no excuse or exemption\nfrom avoiding entering the burning house and that optimization is not\na duty. Thus neither the two children together, nor the second child\nseparately, have a claim against the bystander for not acting in the\noptimal way (Sinclair 2018). Although for the non-consequentialist\nthere is no duty of optimization of the good, he or she admits that\nonce one gave up the justification for not entering the burning house,\none cannot use the risk in order to avoid saving the second child\nbecause the risk has already been undertaken in saving the first child\n(Sinclair 2018).\n\nA similar case of effective altruism is the following: By donating $0\nyou save no one; by donating $50 you save 1 person; by donating $5000\nyou save 500 people (which is proportionate to the previous option);\nby donating $10,000 you save 101 (which is irrational and a waste of\nmoney in comparison to the previous option); by donating $10,050 you\nsave 200 people (Wessels 2015, p. 90). Now, although the last option\nis very \"effective\" and makes excellent use of the extra $50 (in\ncomparison to the second option), the question is whether adding the\nextra $50 donated by the generous donor who gives $10,000 is\nobligatory. The poor person is commended for his supererogatory act of\ngiving $50 to save one person; cannot we regard the extra $50 of the\nrich person who donated $10,000 as his duty, especially in light of\nthe possibility of saving 100 more people by this small sum? Once you\ndonate $10,000 it is reasonable to expect of you to give the extra\nmarginal addition of another $50 so as to double the benefit of your\ndonation (i.e. saving 200 people). This demonstrates that the\nthreshold conception of the supererogatory as everything lying beyond\nthe obligatory requires some refinement. There are circumstances in\nwhich in the realm of the supererogatory some new obligations may be\ncreated (Wessels 2015). As we have seen, such circumstances exist in\nthe case of promises: promising itself is supererogatory; but once a\npromise is made, actions fulfilling the promise become obligatory.\n\nIn recent years there have been attempts to extend the scope of the\ncategory of the supererogatory to non-moral normative domains.\nSome discuss the idea of epistemic supererogation, the idea\nthat in one\u2019s search for knowledge one goes beyond some\nreasonable measure of epistemic responsibility by being more diligent\nor looking for more evidence than is usually required in such search\n(Hedberg 2014). All that is needed for such an extension of the\napplicability of the supererogatory is a normative domain which has a\nscale of value on the one hand (e.g. degrees of epistemic\nresponsibility) and standards of expected time and energy involved in\nthe search of the relevant value (e.g. knowledge). Similarly one may\nalso speak of supererogation in the context of prudence, when\none does more than can be expected of a normal level of care and\nself-control in sticking to a medically desirable diet (McElwee 2017).\nEven in business ethics the category of supererogation is used\nto describe behavior of firms which not only go beyond legal and\neconomic norms but also beyond corporate social responsibility and\n\"positive deviance\" (such as philanthropic activities). One example is\nJohnson&Johnson\u2019s decision to the recall of Tylenol after\nthe 1982 poisoning affair, in which legal counsels, consumers and even\nthe media did not consider it as morally necessary. This was an\nunprecedented decision which meant a huge financial sacrifice on part\nof the firm. Finally, supererogation is also applied in the sphere of\nprofessional ethics, such as the behavior of doctors. As\nagainst Rawls and Heyd, it is argued that supererogatory behavior is\nnot confined to the domain of natural duties but may hold also in\ncases of surpassing professional duties. For example, a nurse who\nbrings books from home to a patient in her ward is acting beyond her\nprofessional duty but she is still acting as a nurse and in that sense\nher act is \"continuous\" with her professional duties. The good\npromoted beyond the normal professional standard is \"profession\nspecific\" (Eriksen 2015).\n\nThese complications and possible extensions of the category of the\nsupererogatory challenge the \"standard model\" of supererogation by\nquestioning the assumptions about the specifically moral nature of\nsupererogation and the clear demarcation between the obligatory and\nthe supererogatory. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"MonCol\">Monographs and Collections</a>", "<a name=\"ArtBooRelSup\">Articles and Books Relating to Supererogation</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"MonCol\">Monographs and Collections</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Cowley, C.
