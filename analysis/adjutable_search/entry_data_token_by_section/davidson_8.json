    "main_text": "Meaning and Truth || Holism and Indeterminacy\n3.4 Holism and Indeterminacy\n\nSince it is indeed a single, combined theory that is the aim here, so\nthe adequacy of any such theory must be measured in terms of the\nextent to which the theory does indeed provide a unified view of the\ntotality of behavioural evidence available to us (taken in conjunction\nwith our own beliefs about the world) rather than by reference to any\nsingle item of behaviour. This can be viewed as a more general version\nof the same requirement, made in relation to a formal theory of\nmeaning, that a theory of meaning for a language address the totality\nof utterances for that language, although, in the context of radical\ninterpretation, this requirement must be understood as also closely\ntied to the need to attend to normative considerations of overall\nrationality. A direct consequence of this holistic approach is that\nthere will always be more than one theory of interpretation that will\nbe adequate to any particular body of evidence since theories may\ndiffer in particular attributions of belief or assignments of meaning\nwhile nevertheless providing an equally satisfactory account of the\nspeaker\u2019s overall behaviour. It is this failure of uniqueness\nthat Davidson terms the \u2018indeterminacy\u2019 of interpretation\nand which provides a counterpart to the \u2018indeterminacy of\ntranslation\u2019 that also appears, though it has a more limited\napplication, in Quine. On the Davidsonian account, such indeterminacy\noften goes unnoticed and is indeed rather less for Davidson than for\nQuine (partly as a consequence of Davidson\u2019s employment of\nTarski and so of the need to read the structure of first-order logic\ninto the language interpreted). It nevertheless remains an\nineliminable feature of all interpretation. Moreover, such\nindeterminacy is not to be viewed merely as reflecting some\nepistemological limitation on interpretation, but rather derives from\nthe holistic character of meaning and of belief. Such concepts refer\nus to overall patterns in the behaviour of speakers rather than to\ndiscrete, entities to which interpretation must somehow gain access.\nIndeed, holism of this sort applies, not only to meanings and beliefs,\nbut also to the so-called \u2018propositional attitudes\u2019 in\ngeneral. The latter are most simply characterised as attitudes\nspecifiable by reference to a proposition (believing that there is\neggplant for dinner is a matter of holding true the proposition that\nthere is eggplant for dinner; desiring that there be eggplant for\ndinner is a matter of wanting it to be true that there be eggplant for\ndinner) and so the contents of attitudes of this sort are\nalways propositional. Davidsonian holism is thus a holism\nthat applies to meanings, to attitudes, and, thereby, to the content\nof attitudes. Indeed, we can speak of the Davidsonian account of\ninterpretation as providing a quite general account of how mental\ncontent is determined (such content being understood as the content of\npropositional mental states such as belief): through the causal\nrelation between speakers and objects in the world and through the\nrational integration of speakers\u2019 behaviour. Thus, as\nDavidson\u2019s approach to the theory of meaning turns out to imply\na more general theory of interpretation, so his holistic view of\nmeaning implies a holistic view of the mental, and of mental content,\nin general.\n\nDavidson\u2019s commitment to the indeterminacy that follows from his\nholistic approach has led some to view his position as involving a\nform of anti-realism about the mind and about beliefs, desires and so\nforth. Davidson argues, however, that the indeterminacy of\ninterpretation should be understood analogously with the indeterminacy\nthat attaches to measurement. Such theories assign numerical values to\nobjects on the basis of empirically observable phenomena and in\naccordance with certain formal theoretical constraints. Where there\nexist different theories that address the same phenomena, each theory\nmay assign different numerical values to the objects at issue (as do\nCelsius and Fahrenheit in the measurement of temperature), and yet\nthere need be no difference in the empirical adequacy of those\ntheories, since what is significant is the overall pattern of\nassignments rather than the value assigned in any particular case.\nSimilarly in interpretation, it is the overall pattern that a theory\nfinds in behaviour that is significant and that remains invariant\nbetween different, but equally adequate, theories. An account of\nmeaning for a language is an account of just this pattern.\n\nAlthough the indeterminacy thesis has sometimes been a focus for\nobjections to Davidson\u2019s approach, it is the more basic thesis\nof holism as developed in its full-blown form in the account of\nradical interpretation (and particularly as it relates to meaning)\nthat has often attracted the most direct and trenchant criticism.\nMichael Dummett has been one of the most important critics of the\nDavidsonian position (see especially Dummett 1975). Dummett argues\nthat Davidson\u2019s commitment to holism not only gives rise to\nproblems concerning, for instance, how a language can be learnt (since\nit seems to require that one come to understand the whole of the\nlanguage at one go, whereas learning is always piecemeal), but that it\nalso restricts Davidson from being able to give what Dummett views as\na properly full-blooded account of the nature of linguistic\nunderstanding (since it means that Davidson cannot provide an account\nthat explicates the semantic in terms of the non-semantic). Criticism\nhas also come from Jerry Fodor, amongst others, whose opposition to\nholism (not only in Davidson, but in Quine, Dennett and elsewhere) is\nlargely motivated by a desire to defend the possibility of a certain\nscientific approach to the mind (see especially, Fodor and Lepore\n1992).\n",
