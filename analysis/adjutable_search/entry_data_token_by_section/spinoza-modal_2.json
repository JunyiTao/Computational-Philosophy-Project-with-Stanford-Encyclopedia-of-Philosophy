    "main_text": "The Distribution of Modality || Modes\n1.2 Modes\n\nImmediately after wrapping up his proof for substance monism in Ip14,\nSpinoza claims in the next proposition that \u201cWhatever is, is in\nGod, and nothing can be or be conceived without God\u201d (Ip15). By\nthe definition of a mode in Id5, Ip15 implies that everything that\nexists other than God is a mode or affection of God. To understand the\nimport of this claim, it is important to understand what a mode is and\nwhat is it for a mode to be in a substance, for Spinoza.\n\nA natural way to think about modes is as a certain kind of property.\nThe circular shape of the coin is a mode of that coin. On\nthis reading, being circular is a state of the coin, a particularized\nway that the coin is. Spinoza\u2019s claim that modes are\n\u201cin\u201d their substances also suggests that modes\ninhere in substances akin to the way that properties inhere\nin things, and that modes are therefore predicable of substances as\nsubjects of predication. Circularity, we might say, inheres in the\ncoin and the coin is circular. Of course, there is an\nextremely wide range of views about properties and property-bearers\n(see the entry on\n properties),\n so claiming that modes are akin to properties that inhere in\nsubstances will not answer all questions. But even putting aside\nquestions about inherence, property instantiation, and predication\nrelations, it may seem like Spinoza has made a colossal blunder in\nIp15. After all, how can a table or human being be anything like a\nproperty? How can I inhere in something else? What sense\nwould it make to say of something \u2014 a substance \u2014 that it\nis Sam Newlandsish in the same sense in which I say of it\nthat it is round? If there is such a thing as a \u201ccategory\nmistake,\u201d this may seem like an especially clear case of\n one.[7]\n\nIt would be disappointing if this objection simply assumed from the\noutset that (a) objects like tables and human beings are substances\nand (b) substances neither inhere in nor are predicable of other\nsubstances. Spinoza agrees with (b), but he has already argued\npace (a) that there can be only one substance. It would be\nunfair to grant him that conclusion in Ip14 and then insist upon\nreading Ip15 that other things still ought to have all the features of\nsubstances. (Of course, these intuitive concerns may well provide\nreasons to reconsider Spinoza\u2019s arguments for Ip14.)\n\nInterpreters have tried to make sense of Spinoza\u2019s\nidentification of everyday objects with modes without presupposing the\ndenial of his substance monism. One strategy would be to deny that\nSpinoza intends anything like property, inherence and predication by\nhis identification of everyday objects with modes of God. On this\ninterpretation, Spinoza\u2019s claims about modes and\n\u201cin\u201d in Ip15 are really just claims about the\ncausal dependence of all things on God (Curley 1969).\nEveryday objects inhere in God in the sense that they depend causally\non God. When Spinoza claims, \u201cWhatever is, is in God,\u201d he\nreally means only that everything is causally dependent on God, a\nfantastically unremarkable claim in the 17th century.\nIndeed, as others have objected (Bennett 1991, Carriero 1995, Melamed\n2009), this proposal makes Spinoza\u2019s claim in Ip15 so\nunremarkable that it is hard to see why Spinoza went to such\nobfuscating lengths to phrase his ontology in terms of modes and\ninherence in the first place, since he had the categories of efficient\ncausation and dependent beings at his disposal. \n\nA different strategy (Carriero 1995) preserves the inherence link\nbetween modes and properties, but understands Spinoza\u2019s modes as\nparticularized accidents or, in contemporary terms, tropes\n(see the entry on\n tropes).\n According to this reading, collections of particularized properties\nconstitute everyday objects for Spinoza. Although such bundles of\ntropes inhere in substance, they are not predicable of substance.\nHence, although I inhere in substance, it is not the case that\nsubstance is Sam Newlandsish, whatever that may mean. Whereas\nthe first interpretation explained inherence as nothing but efficient\ncausation, this reading tries to keep causation and inherence\nintensionally (though perhaps not extensionally) distinct metaphysical\ndependence relations.\n\nAnother, more circuitous option begins with a functional account of\nmodes in Spinoza\u2019s ontology. The function of modes, according to\npassages like Ip25c, is to provide ways of expressing or conceiving\nthe power of substance. Perhaps Spinoza actually provides an\nanalysis of inherence in terms of this expressive or\nconceptual relation, similar to the way in which he provides an\nanalysis of causation in terms of conceptual connection. Consider, for\ninstance, Id3, in which Spinoza defines substance as that which is\n\u201c[a] in itself and [b] is conceived through itself, that is, [c]\nthat whose concept does not require the concept of another thing from\nwhich it must be formed\u201d (the brackets are mine). Instead of\nleaving inherence as an unprincipled primitive relation of\nmetaphysical dependence (pace the PSR), one could read [c] as\nproviding an analysis of both [a] and [b]. One thing inheres\nin another in virtue of being conceived through it, which, like\ncausation, is a matter of conceptual involvement. That everyday\nobjects are modes inhering in and predicated of substance is\nextensionally and intensionally equivalent to everyday\nobjects being conceived through substance. Whereas Curley\u2019s\ninterpretation took causation to be Spinoza\u2019s\nunderlying account of inherence, this interpretation takes\nconceptual involvement to be Spinoza\u2019s underlying\naccount of both inherence and causation (for defense, see Newlands\n2010a; for dissents, see DiPoppa 2013, Melamed 2012 and Laerke\n2011).\n\nAlthough we will not try to settle this debate here, different\ninterpretations of Spinoza\u2019s category of modes will yield\ndifferent accounts of his views on the necessity of modes. For\npurposes of ease and neutrality, we will frequently refer to modes as\n\u201cobjects,\u201d which are intended to be a neutral placeholder\nfor \u201cwhatever else exists besides substance.\u201d\n1.2.1 The Modality of Modes: An Overview\n\nEarlier, it was noted that Spinoza thinks infinitely many\nnon-substantial objects exist: \u201cFrom the necessity of the divine\nnature there must follow infinitely many things in infinitely many\nways, i.e., everything which can fall under an infinite\nintellect\u201d (Ip16).  Although Spinoza means more by\n\u201cinfinite\u201d than simply \u201cexhaustive,\u201d he\nclearly intends \u201cexhaustive\u201d as well. How many objects are\nthere? \u201cAs many as there can be together\u201d is\nSpinoza\u2019s basic reply. That is, Spinoza endorses a principle of\nontological plenitude (POP), according to which the greatest number of\ncompossible non-substantial objects actually exists. Part of\nSpinoza\u2019s motivation for POP may derive from the PSR itself,\nsince if the actual world were sub-maximal, non-existing but\nintrinsically possible objects would have no reason for not existing,\nwhich would be a brute fact. Perhaps it would also be an undesirable\nbrute fact if (per impossibile) a maximal world with fewer\nobjects than the actual world existed; what would explain God\u2019s\nrealization of a smaller maximal collection when a larger maximal\ncollection is possible (see Ip33s2)? In any case, Spinoza\u2019s POP\nimplies that the number of existing objects is necessarily fixed.\n\nAlthough this is already quite a strong conclusion, it does not yet\nrise to the level of full-blown necessitarianism with respect to\nmodes. There are still at least three possible sources of contingency\nfor the maximally full world of modes, each of which would be\ncompatible with POP. Alternative possibility 1 (AP1): There could have\nbeen a different collection of modes, equal in size to the actually\nexisting collection, but with entirely different members.\nAlternative possibility 2 (AP2): For some proper subset of the\ncollection of actually existing modes, there could have been a\ndifferent, equinumerous proper subset of modes instead. Alternative\npossibility 3 (AP3): One or more of the actual modes could have had\ndifferent characteristics than it in fact has.\n\nTo illustrate, let the collection of shirts hanging in my closet stand\nfor the collection of modes. Suppose that my closet could not contain\nmore or fewer shirts than it currently contains\u2014 my closet is as\nfull as it can get and I\u2019m the sort of person who could never\nhave fewer shirts than the most that can all fit in there together.\nStill, couldn\u2019t I have had an entirely different but\nequinumerous collection of shirts (AP1)? Or, keeping some of the\nshirts fixed, couldn\u2019t I have had a modest blue shirt instead of\nthe orange plaid shirt sitting there in the middle (AP2)? Or, keeping\nall the shirts in the closet fixed, couldn\u2019t the orange plaid\nshirt have had a single pocket instead of having the two pockets that\nit actually has (AP3)?\n\nNecessitarianism requires not only the necessity of the\nnumber of existents; it demands the necessity of each member\nand the necessity of all of its characteristics. Hence, even given POP\nand Ip16, it remains an open question whether Spinoza wants to deny\nthat there are any alternative possibilities for modes. Am I really\nstuck with the exact shirts I\u2019ve got, double-pocketed orange\nplaid and all?\n\nTo understand why Spinoza might be attracted to mode necessitarianism,\nwe need to consider a few additional details of his ontology of modes.\nI have been lumping modes together into a single ontological category:\neverything that is not a substance. But Spinoza sometimes\ndistinguishes between two types of modes, infinite modes and finite\nmodes. Unfortunately, Spinoza gives only a very sparse account of\ninfinite modes in the Ethics, and he makes very few explicit\ntextual references to them outside the\n Ethics.[8]\n When Georg Schuller wrote to Spinoza to ask him for examples of these\ncurious entities, Spinoza replied with obscure gems like \u201cthe\nface of the whole universe\u201d and \u201cabsolutely infinite\nintellect\u201d (Ep64). If the best elucidation of\na philosophical doctrine makes reference to \u201cthe face of\nthe whole universe,\u201d that may be a good sign that the doctrine\nneeds further development. Unfortunately for Spinoza\u2019s readers,\ninfinite modes appear to do some significant work in his metaphysics,\nso they cannot simply be ignored if one wants to understand\nSpinoza\u2019s modal commitments.\n1.2.2 Infinite modes\n\nThe most salient feature of infinite modes is that they are more\ndirectly related to substance than finite modes are. Spinoza claims\nthat infinite modes follow more or less directly from \u201cthe\nabsolute nature of any of God\u2019s attributes,\u201d whereas\nfinite modes do not follow from the absolute nature of God\u2019s\nattributes (see Ip21\u201322 and Ip28d). According to some\ninterpreters, understanding this distinction is the key to\nunderstanding whether or not Spinoza was a full-blown\nnecessitarian.\n\nAt first glance, Spinoza\u2019s picture seems clear enough. (We will\ncontinue to ignore the complicating role of attributes.) Some modes\nfollow directly from the absolute nature of substance. Interpreters\nfrequently call these immediate infinite modes (Ip21). Other\nmodes follow directly from those immediate infinite modes. These are\ncommonly called mediate infinite modes (Ip22). There is then\na gap of some kind, and on the other side of the gap is the maximally\nfull collection of finite modes. Unlike the infinite modes, particular\nfinite modes do not follow, either directly or indirectly, from the\nabsolute nature of substance.\n\nThe distinction between infinite and finite modes is relevant for\nSpinoza\u2019s views on modality because of what he says about the\nmodal status of infinite modes. Spinoza reasons that if an object\nnecessarily follows from something that necessarily exists, then that\nobject also necessarily exists (Ip21). This sounds similar to a\nfamiliar and widely accepted modal distribution axiom: \\((\\Box p \\amp\n\\Box(p \\to q)) \\to \\Box q\\). According to this reasoning, if God\nnecessarily exists, and if the existence of a mode follows necessarily\nfrom the existence and nature of God, then that mode necessarily\nexists too. Of course, we need not and should not interpret\nSpinoza\u2019s following-from relation as the strict logical\nentailment of contemporary modal logic. The main point is that\nnecessity transfers down the following-from chain, according to\nSpinoza. If x necessarily exists and if y\nnecessarily follows from x, then y necessarily\nexists too. For ease, one may call this the modal transfer\nprinciple. (Later, we will try to gain a better understanding of\nexactly why Spinoza thinks the modal transfer principle works.)\n\nNotice that both conjuncts of the modal transfer principle\nmust be satisfied for it to apply. That is, for the modal transfer\nprinciple to apply to some y, it must be the case that both\n(i) y follows necessarily from x and (ii) x\nexists necessarily. Hence, if God exists necessarily and if the\nexistence of Bruce Springsteen follows necessarily from God\u2019s\nexistence, then Springsteen exists necessarily too. Whatever\ndifferences there may be between a thing that exists necessarily in\nvirtue of its own nature and a thing that exists necessarily in virtue\nof following from something else that exists necessarily, that\ndistinction is wholly internal to necessity. Differences\nbetween external and internal sources of necessity, a difference to\nwhich Spinoza sometimes draws attention (Ip33s), does not entail\ndifferences in type of necessity or even strength of\nnecessity, and Spinoza nowhere says that it does.\n\nSpinoza\u2019s modal transfer principle appeals to the relation of\nfollowing-from. To a contemporary reader, this might sound like a\nrelation of logical entailment, but Spinoza clearly understands it to\nbe some kind of causal relation (e.g., Ip16c, Ip28d). This means that\nSpinoza\u2019s following-from relation shares the features of his\ncausal relations, including the fact that causal relations involve\nnecessary connections between relata (Ia3). That is, if y\nfollows from x, then y necessarily follows from\nx. Furthermore, Spinoza claims that every mode\nfollows from something else (Ip16 and Ip36). Therefore, every mode\nnecessarily follows from something else, in which case condition (i)\nof the modal transfer principle is satisfied for every mode. This does\nnot yet entail necessitarianism, however, for we still need to\ndetermine whether condition (ii) is universally satisfied as well.\nEach mode necessarily follows from something else, but does what it\nfollows from exist necessarily?\n\nIn the case of existing infinite modes, Spinoza\u2019s\nanswer is clearly affirmative. In Ip22, Spinoza claims that so-called\n\u201cimmediate\u201d infinite modes follow from something that\nexists necessarily, namely substance. Therefore, by the modal transfer\nprinciple, every existing immediate infinite mode exists necessarily.\nFurthermore, Spinoza claims that every so-called \u201cmediate\u201d\ninfinite mode follows from something that exists necessarily (namely,\nan immediate infinite mode), so every mediate infinite mode exists\nnecessarily as well (Ip23). In short, because there is a chain of\nnecessary dependence stretching from substance to every existing\ninfinite mode, every existing infinite mode exists necessarily.\n\nOnce again, even this strong modal conclusion is not equivalent to\nfull-blown necessitarianism regarding infinite modes. Even if every\nexisting infinite mode necessarily exists, could there have\nbeen other infinite modes as well? While there may not be any texts in\nwhich Spinoza explicitly rules this out, it is easy to imagine what he\nwould say. Non-actual infinite modes do not exist necessarily, or else\nthey would actually exist, on the plausible assumption that necessity\nentails actuality \\((\\Box p \\to p).\\) So, for reductio, consider a\nnon-actual possible world, \\(w^*\\), that contains\nSophia, one of these extra, non-actual infinite modes. What\nis the manner of Sophia\u2019s dependence on substance?\nSpinoza\u2019s discussion of infinite modes suggests that Sophia\nmust, by definition, follow from God\u2019s absolute nature (either\nimmediately or mediately). If so, then Sophia follows from the\nabsolute nature of God in \\(w^*\\), on the assumption that true\ndefinitions express necessary truths. But in that case, the modal\ntransfer principle will apply to Sophia in \\(w^*\\), in which case\nSophia\u2019s existence is necessary. However, again assuming that\nnecessity entails actuality, Sophia would be actual, pace our initial\nassumption.  QED.\n\nOf course, that reasoning relies on possible world semantics and some\nloaded (though plausible) theses about relations between possible\nworlds. Perhaps Spinoza could reach a similar conclusion without\nrecourse to all that. Spinoza could instead appeal back to his\nplentitude principle and its basis in the PSR. If there could have\nbeen more infinite modes than there in fact are, these non-actual,\nmerely possible modes must be compossible with the collection of\nnecessarily existing infinite modes. (Another plausible assumption,\nexpressed loosely: if something is not compossible with what\nnecessarily exists, then its existence is not possible.) But if there\nwere non-actual infinite modes that were compossible with the\ncollection of necessarily existing infinite modes, what could explain\ntheir non-existence? Unless an answer can be given, Spinoza will infer\nfalsity from a violation of the PSR. We again reach the conclusion of\nnecessitarianism with respect to every infinite mode. Like substance,\nevery possible infinite mode necessarily\n exists.[9]\n1.2.3 Finite modes: A first pass\n\nInfinite modes exist necessarily because they follow necessarily from\nsomething that exists necessarily, namely God. What about finite\nthings like furniture and people? This much seems clear: if a\nfinite mode follows from an infinite mode or from substance itself,\nthen by the modal transfer principle, it exists necessarily too. But\ndoes any finite mode follow from an infinite mode or from substance?\nThis is where the aforementioned \u201cgap\u201d between infinite\nand finite modes becomes modally significant. Consider what Spinoza\nsays in the lengthy and important demonstration of Ip28:\n\n\nWhatever has been determined to exist and produce an effect has been\nso determined by God (by Ip26 and Ip24c). But what is finite and has a\ndeterminate existence could not have been produced by the absolute\nnature of an attribute of God; for whatever follows from the absolute\nnature of an attribute of God is eternal and infinite (Ip21). It had,\ntherefore, to follow either from God or from an attribute of God\ninsofar as it is considered to be affected by some mode\u2026.But it\nalso could not follow from God, or from an attribute of God, insofar\nas it is affected by a mode which is eternal and infinite (by Ip22).\nIt had, therefore, to follow from or be determined to exist and\nproduce an effect by God insofar as it is modified by a mode which is\nfinite and has a determinate existence\u2026and in turn, this cause\nor mode\u2026had also to be determined by another which is also\nfinite and has a determinate existence; and again\u2026and so always\n(by the same reasoning) to infinity.\n\n\nOn a cursory reading of this passage, Spinoza seems to say that no\nfinite mode follows from either an infinite mode or from \u201cthe\nabsolute nature of an attribute of God,\u201d lest that mode be\n\u201ceternal and infinite,\u201d pace the nature of finite modes.\nIf so, then perhaps Spinoza\u2019s point in this passage is that\nparticular finite modes, like the desk, follow from only\nother particular finite modes, such as a pile of wood, which\nthemselves follow from only other finite modes, such as some trees,\nand so\n on.[10]\n If so, then it appears that finite modes do not follow from anything\nthat exists necessarily, in which case the modal transfer principle\nwill not apply. Absent some other source of necessity for finite\nmodes, it follows that Spinoza is not a necessitarian.\n\nSuppose, however, that the causal history of the desk is traced all\nthe way back to the very beginning of the world. Surely the starting\npoint of the universe \u2014 that from which all the subsequent\nobjects and events necessarily follow \u2014 surely the initial mode\nfollows from God\u2019s nature or from one of God\u2019s infinite\nmodes. If so, then by the modal transfer principle, the first finite\nmode will exist necessarily, and so everything that follows from it,\nincluding the desk, will exist necessarily too.\n\nSpinoza rejects this reasoning. He has little sympathy with the\ntraditional monotheistic idea that God created the world ex\nnihilo, and he denies that there is a true \u201cin the\nbeginning\u201d style cosmogony. In the quotation from Ip28 above,\nSpinoza denies that the series of finite modes has an initial starting\npoint. Spinoza thinks that the series of finite objects extends\nbackwards in time in an infinitely long causal chain that contains no\ninitial state. For every finite cause of the desk, there will always\nbe a temporally prior finite cause of that cause.  And a prior cause\nof the cause of that cause. And so on, ad infinitum. Prima\nfacie, there is no PSR violation with this picture. For every\nparticular finite object, there is a sufficient reason for its\nexistence and characteristics in terms of its prior finite\ncauses. Each finite object follows from and is thus explained by the\nprior state of the world, whose constituents are also explained by a\nprior state. If that is all Spinoza intended to say about the modal\nstatus of finite things, then one could read his fiery denials of\ncontingency as defenses of mere causal determinism and not full-blown\nnecessitarianism.\n1.2.4 The problem of the gap\n\nAn important lesson from the previous section is that if there is a\ncausal gap between finite modes and infinite modes, then\nSpinoza\u2019s modal transfer principle will not apply to finite\nmodes, since condition (ii) will remain unsatisfied in each case.\nFinite things will be causally determined solely by other finite\nthings, none of which exist necessarily.\n\nHowever tempting, this picture has trouble making sense of\nSpinoza\u2019s repeated claims that everything is caused by\nGod (Ip25\u201326), a claim Spinoza repeats in the very first\nsentence of Ip28d itself. Spinoza frequently emphasizes that\nGod\u2019s power or essence is the cause and explanation of\neverything that exists (Ip16, 17, 29s, 33, IAppendix). But if finite\nmodes follow only from other finite modes, then it seems that they do\nnot follow from God or substance, which violates one of the\nmost basic features of modes, namely their dependence, qua modes, on\nsubstance (Id5).\n\nThis is a notoriously difficult question facing Spinoza\u2019s\nmetaphysics, one that was raised by Leibniz just a year after\nSpinoza\u2019s death (Leibniz 1969, 203). Sometimes this worry was\nhistorically expressed as whether Spinoza can \u201cderive\u201d the\nfinite from the infinite, but it is not really a question of logical\ndeduction (H\u00fcbner 2014). The issue is whether Spinoza can\nconsistently maintain that God is the cause of all things and that\nfinite things follow only from other finite things.\n\nOne possible response would appeal to the close relationship between\nfinite modes and the power of God. Spinoza sometimes describes finite\nmodes as limited expressions of God\u2019s own power (Ip36d; IVp4d),\nin which case perhaps being caused by other finite modes is a way\nof being determined by God\u2019s power. The success of this response\ndepends on the relationship between God and God\u2019s modes for\nSpinoza, an interpretive point that is also heavily disputed. This\nreply would not work, for instance, if the fundamental connection\nbetween substance and modes is purely causal.\n\nCurley has proposed a more elaborate and elegant solution for\nreconciling Ip28 and the claim that all modes follow from substance\nwithout positing any closer relationship between God and finite modes.\n(This is understandable since Curley is the leading advocate of the\n\u201ccausal only\u201d interpretation of how modes depend on\nsubstance.) Curley suggests that Spinoza\u2019s finite modes are only\npartially determined by other finite modes (Curley 1969).\nThey are also partially determined by infinite modes, which Curley\nunderstands to be general features of the world described by the laws\nof nature. The desk follows partly from infinite modes and partly from\nother particular finite modes.\n\nIn more contemporary terms, Curley\u2019s proposal is that every\nstate of the world is determined by the laws of nature plus the prior\nstate of the world. The laws of nature and the antecedent state each\ncontribute to bringing about the desk, but neither is sufficient on\nits own. This division of labor would allow Spinoza to overcome the\nproblem of the gap without violating Ip28. Particular finite modes do\nfollow partly from God\u2019s nature, in virtue of following partly\nfrom infinite modes \u2013 but only partly. They also follow partly\nfrom other finite modes. Admittedly, Spinoza does not say in Ip28 that\nfinite modes follow only partially from other finite modes,\nbut neither does he explicitly say that finite modes follow\nentirely from other finite modes.\n\nIf Curley is correct, then because finite modes are only\npartially determined by infinite modes, the modal transfer\nprinciple will not apply to finite modes. (One assumption here is that\ncondition (i) requires following from entirely.) This blocks\nnecessitarianism, since no finite mode would follow entirely from\nsomething that exists necessarily. Thus, Curley\u2019s interpretation\nconcludes, particular finite modes do not exist necessarily, despite\n(partly) following from God\u2019s nature. Hence full-blown\nnecessitarianism with respect to finite modes is false and AP1, AP2,\nand AP3 represent genuine alternative possibilities for Spinoza. This\nfinds support in passages like IIa1:\n\nThe essence of man does not involve necessary existence, that is, from\nthe order of Nature it can happen equally that this or that man does\nexist or that he does not exist.\n\n\nAlthough the first half of that statement is thoroughly traditional,\nSpinoza\u2019s claim that the order of Nature leaves the existence or\nnon-existence of particular finite things undetermined seems to posit\ngenuine contingency in the world. (In IIp10d, Spinoza cites IIa1 and\nclaims that it would be \u201cabsurd\u201d to conclude that a\nparticular person exists necessarily, though it is unclear whether the\nabsurdity lies in the modal conclusion itself or in the reasoning\nabout finite essences that would lead to the modal conclusion.)\n\nAs for those passages in which Spinoza seems to profess full-blown\nnecessitarianism (i.e., Ip16, 17, 29, 33, IAppendix), his appeals to\nnecessity could be ambiguous between a strong form of determinism and\nfull-blown necessitarianism. Yes, everything finite necessarily\nfollows from something else and so everything finite is\n\u201cnecessary\u201d in the sense of \u201cbeing fully\ndetermined,\u201d but nothing finite follows entirely from something\nthat necessarily exists, and so no finite mode exists necessarily in\nthe full-blown sense of that\n term.[11]\n Importantly, Curley defends Spinoza\u2019s rejection of\nnecessitarianism without positing a complete causal gap between finite\nmodes and God\u2019s nature; finite modes do partly follow from God\nand God\u2019s infinite modes.\n\nHowever, consider AP1 again, the possibility of an entirely different\ncollection of finite modes. According to Curley, because no member of\nthe collection exists necessarily, the collection itself is not\nnecessary. That is, God could have brought about an entirely different\nseries of finite modes. If so, what explains why this series\nof finite modes exists as opposed to one of the alternative possible\nseries? (The question is not why God chose to create this\nseries of modes rather than another possible series, a question that\nanimated Leibniz. Spinoza denies that God has a will in the\ntraditional sense, and so talk about choosing one possible\nworld over another has no place in Spinoza\u2019s system (Ip17s and\nIIp49c). Nonetheless, the PSR demands a reason in virtue of which God\nrealizes this series of finite modes rather than another possible\nseries.)\n\nI noted earlier that Spinoza could explain why a particular finite\nmode exists by appealing (in part) to other particular finite modes,\nnamely its actual causes. But Spinoza could not explain why this\nseries, as opposed to some other series, exists by appealing to other\nparticular existing modes. This would be akin to explaining why an\nentire series of causes exists by appealing to one of those very\ncauses. We aren\u2019t asking why any particular mode exists, but why\nthis whole series, and not some other series, exists. Appealing to yet\nanother contingent fact appears to get us nowhere towards accounting\nfor the entire set of contingent\n facts.[12]\n\nNor could Spinoza appeal to substance or infinite modes to explain the\nentire series of finite modes, for two reasons. First, according to\nCurley\u2019s own account, substance and its infinite modes do not\nfully explain or cause any particular finite mode (by Ip28). But as\nthere seems to be nothing to the collection of finite modes beyond the\nindividual members themselves, it is unclear how substance and its\ninfinite modes could fully explain or cause the entire series without\nfully causing or explaining any individual member.\n\nSecond, if the entire series of finite modes were caused by God or\nsomething that necessarily followed from God, then the entire series\nwould exist necessarily after all (pace AP1). Remember that causation,\nnecessary connection, and following-from track each other, according\nto Spinoza. So if the entire series of finite modes follows from\nsomething that exists necessarily, then by the modal transfer\nprinciple, the series itself would also exist necessarily. If so, then\nthere would not be any alternative possible series to the series\nof actual finite modes. Furthermore, it is hard to see how Spinoza\ncould block the transfer of necessity from the series of finite modes\nto the individual members of that series, in which case both AP2 and\nAP3 would be ruled out as well.\n\nThis leaves us with an interpretive dilemma. On the one hand,\nCurley\u2019s account respects both the demonstration of Ip28 and\nSpinoza\u2019s frequent claims that all modes follow from God\u2019s\nnature. A consequence of his account is that Spinoza is not a\nfull-blown necessitarian. On the other hand, Curley\u2019s Spinoza\nmust reject very natural-sounding demands of the PSR. Spinoza would\nhave to accept that there is no explanation why this entire series of\nfinite modes exists rather than another possible series, a point\nCurley has conceded (Curley and Walski, 1999).\n\nThat concession might seem like too high an interpretive price to pay,\nespecially since there is no independent reason to think Spinoza\nrejects the demands of the PSR when applied to the entire series of\nfinite modes. It would be nice if Spinoza could accept an unrestricted\nversion of the PSR and still preserve the claim in Ip28d that\nparticular finite modes do not follow from infinite modes or the\nabsolute nature of God without recreating the problematic gap. In the\nnext section, we\u2019ll consider an attempt to do just that. A\nconsequence of this alternative reading will be that Spinoza endorses\nfull-blown necessitarianism.\n1.2.5 Finite modes: a second pass\n\nLet us return to Spinoza\u2019s crucial claim about finite modes in\nIp28. He states that particular finite modes (a) do not follow from\n\u201cthe absolute nature of an attribute of God,\u201d even though\n(b) they follow from an attribute of God \u201cinsofar as it is\nconsidered to be affected by some mode.\u201d (As a reminder: we will\ncontinue to drop the reference to attributes for ease of expression.)\nTwo questions immediately arise:\n\n(1)\nWhat is the difference between following from the\nabsolute nature of God and merely following from God in the\nsecond, more qualified manner?\n(2)\nWhy should the way a particular thing is considered be\nrelevant for this distinction?\n\n\nAccording to one prominent interpretation (Garrett 1991 and 2018), to\nfollow from the absolute nature of God is to follow in an\nunqualified, pervasive and permanent manner, as infinite modes do\n(Ip21\u201323). Spinoza denies that finite modes follow in that way.\nHowever, following from God\u2019s nature in a more qualified way\ndoes not imply that finite modes do not follow from God at all \u2013\nto infer that would be to reintroduce the problem of the gap. Rather,\nGarrett contends, Spinoza denies only that any particular finite mode\nfollows from God\u2019s absolute nature independently of its\nrelations to other finite objects. This leaves open the\npossibility that although no particular finite mode follows from the\nabsolute nature of God, the entire collection of finite modes as a\nwhole follows from the absolute nature of God or from an infinite mode\nof God.\n\nGarrett\u2019s account presents a five-fold division of\nSpinoza\u2019s expression \u201cfollowing from God\u2019s\nnature\u201d:\n\nThe immediate infinite modes follow directly from God\u2019s\nabsolute nature.\nThe mediate infinite modes follow indirectly from God\u2019s\nabsolute nature.\nThe infinite collection of finite modes, considered as a whole,\nfollows indirectly from God\u2019s absolute\n nature.[13]\nEach particular finite mode, considered in relation to the other\nmembers of the series, follows from God\u2019s non-absolute\nnature.\nEach finite mode, considered independently of its relation to the\nother members of the series, does not follow from God\u2019s\nnature.\n\n\nIf we apply Spinoza\u2019s modal transfer principle to this division,\nthe objects described in [i] and [ii] exist necessarily. Similarly,\nthe necessity of God\u2019s nature in [iii] trickles down the\nfollowing-from relation, and so even though the series as a whole\nfollows only indirectly from God, its existence would nonetheless be\nnecessary, as with mediate infinite modes. \n\nWhat about particular finite modes described in [iv]? On\nGarrett\u2019s proposal, their existence too will be necessary, which\ncommits Spinoza to full-blown necessitarianism. To see why, notice\nthat the difference between [iii] and [iv] is not a function of the\npresence or absence of the following-from relation itself. The\ndifference is between following from God\u2019s absolute vs.\nnon-absolute nature, whatever that distinction amounts\nto. Spinoza\u2019s modal transfer principle is indifferent to\nthe difference between [iii] and [iv]. The principle is too\ncoarse-grained to track the absolute/non-absolute distinction; it\ntracks only the following-from relation from a necessarily existing\nsource. Since both conditions of the principle are satisfied in [iv],\nnecessity is transferred from the entire collection of finite modes to\nthe individual members themselves. Thus, the desk exists necessarily.\nIf this is correct, Spinoza can consistently claim that every finite\nmode exists necessarily and follows from God\u2019s nature in\nsome way, while still maintaining that no particular modes\nfollows directly or indirectly from the absolute nature of\nGod.\n\nThe objects described in [v] do not follow from God\u2019s nature at\nall, in which case the modal transfer principle will not be satisfied.\nInsofar as that is the only available source for their necessity, it\nfollows that they do not exist necessarily. But what is the difference\nbetween the objects described in [iv] and the objects described in\n[v]? In one sense, nothing: they are the same finite modes! That\ncannot be the full story, however, lest there be no explanation why\nthe modes in [iv] follow from the nature of God whereas those very\nsame modes in [v] do not. The only difference between [iv] and\n[v] is how a mode is considered in each case. (Although\nGarrett himself uses this \u201cconsidered\u201d claim, he does not\nsay whether he thinks there are any true ways of considering objects\ncorresponding to [v].)\n\nHence, if the desk is considered in relation to the entire series of\nfinite modes, it follows from God\u2019s nature and exists\nnecessarily. Considered independently of that relation \u2014 if such\ncan be done \u2014 the desk does not follow from God\u2019s nature\nand does not exist necessarily. This gives rise to a more precise\nversion of our earlier question:\n\n(2\u2032)\nWhy should the way a particular thing is\nconsidered in relation to other particular things be relevant\nfor whether it follows from God?\n\n\nAnd, since that difference also generates a modal difference, we\nshould also ask:\n\n(3)\nWhy should the way a thing is considered be relevant for its\nmodal status?\n\n\nAnswering these questions in the next section will drive us yet deeper\ninto Spinoza\u2019s modal metaphysics. First, however,\nGarrett\u2019s account faces an independent worry (Curley and Walski\n1999, Huenemann 1999). Return to the relationship between [iii] and\n[iv]. There is supposed to be a significant difference between the\nmanner in which the collection of finite modes follows from God as\na whole and the manner by which any particular member of that\ncollection follows from God. However, if the entire collection of\nfinite modes follows indirectly from God\u2019s absolute nature, that\nseems to imply that each individual member of the series\nalso follows from God\u2019s absolute nature. Imagine trying to\ncover the collection of objects on my desk in coffee without making it\nthe case that each object on my desk is covered in coffee. This seems\nimpossible, as there is nothing more to the collection of things on my\ndesk being covered in coffee than each and every thing on my desk\nbeing covered in coffee. Even worse, it is hard to see how the entire\nseries of finite modes could have the property following from\nGod\u2019s absolute nature if no member of the series has that\nproperty.\n\nThe most promising line of response denies that the series of finite\nmodes is nothing above and beyond its individual members. Following\nothers, the entirety of finite modes has been described as a\n\u201cseries\u201d or \u201ccollection,\u201d a label that\nnaturally suggests that the properties of the entire collection will\nbe posterior to and derivative from the properties of its individual\nmembers. Spinoza himself rarely refers to just the collection of\nfinite modes with a single expression, though he sometimes includes\nthem in his locution \u201cthe order of nature\u201d and he\ndescribes them as a \u201cseries\u201d twice, both outside the\nEthics (C I/41 and C I/307). Regardless of the terminology,\none could contend that the whole series is more than just the sum of\nits the members. Spinoza does sometimes suggest that wholes can be\nprior to their parts (Ep32, IIp13le7s), though other times he suggests\nthat parts are always prior to wholes (Ip15). Whether the series of\nfinite modes is more holist or atomistic, and whether, on a holist\nmereological account, one of the non-supervening properties of the\nwhole series is following from God\u2019s absolute nature,\nare still open interpretive questions. The soundness of this reply\nwill likely turn on whether or not the collection of finite modes is\nitself an infinite mode, a point about which interpreters continue to\ndisagree.\n2. The Nature of Modality\n\nWe have now seen two competing accounts of Spinoza\u2019s views about\nthe modal status of finite objects. Some argue that Spinoza endorses a\nstrong form of determinism that falls short of full-blown\nnecessitarianism. On this reading, finite modes do not exist\nnecessarily and there are alternative possibilities to the series of\nactual finite modes that God did not bring about. Others have argued\nthat Spinoza\u2019s account of the relationship between God and\nfinite modes readily accommodates full-blown necessitarianism and\nthat, given the large number of passages in which Spinoza appears to\naffirm necessitarianism without qualification, there is\nsufficient evidence that Spinoza intentionally endorsed\nfull-blown necessitarianism.\n\nLike almost all discussions of Spinoza\u2019s modal commitments, this\ndispute focus on the distribution of modal properties: which\nthings exist necessarily? Far less attention has been given to\nSpinoza\u2019s account of the nature of modality. This\nsection discusses whether Spinoza has an account of modality itself,\nand if so, what light that account sheds on the dispute over his\nalleged necessitarianism.\n\nSpinoza is emphatic that particular modal ascriptions have reasons\nbehind them: \u201cA thing is called necessary either by reason of\nits essence or by reason of its cause\u201d (Ip33s1). But we\ncan also consider a higher-order question: for what\nreason(s) do modal ascriptions work in the way that Spinoza claims\nthey do? For ease, let us focus on modal properties instead\nof modal ascriptions. The question is similar to the one raised\nearlier about causation. What explains causation itself? Arguably,\nSpinoza\u2019s answer is that causal relations obtain in virtue of\nconceptual connections between causal relata. A parallel question can\nbe raised about modality itself. Do basic modal properties obtain in\nvirtue of other, non-modal properties or is modality primitive for\nSpinoza?\n\nGiven Spinoza\u2019s embrace of the PSR and his efforts to explain\nother dependence relations (such as causation and, perhaps,\ninherence), it would be surprising and disappointing if modality got a\nfree explanatory pass. Of course, we probably should not expect\nSpinoza to have anything like a full-blown theory of modality in the\nforms that contemporary metaphysicians now provide (for an example,\nsee the entry on the\n possibilism-actualism debate).\n Only in recent decades have philosophers come to appreciate how\ncomplex and rich the metaphysics of modality is, and Spinoza would be\nin good company if he says things that seem, by today\u2019s\nstandards, mostly underdeveloped. Nonetheless, he may have the\nbeginnings of an account that helps illuminate his other modal\ncommitments.\n\nA promising place to start is the modal status of God\u2019s\nexistence. In Ip11, Spinoza claims that God necessarily exists. But\nwhat is it in virtue of which God necessarily exists? This might sound\nlike an odd question. Once explanations reach a necessarily existing\nobject, are there further in virtue of questions to be asked\nabout that object\u2019s existence? More generally, when we reach\nnecessity, haven\u2019t we reached the end of\n explanations?[14]\n Not always: mathematics is full of asymmetrical\nexplanatory relations among necessarily true propositions.\nSimilarly, Spinoza thinks that substance causes and asymmetrically\nexplains necessarily existing infinite modes. Hence Spinoza must\nbelieve that dependence and explanation are more fine-grained\nrelations than modern logical entailment, since according to the\nlatter, every necessary proposition entails and is entailed by every\nother necessary proposition.\n\nSpinoza explains the necessity of God\u2019s existence by appealing\nto God\u2019s nature. This may sound like a non-answer, but it is\nnot. Spinoza is not claiming that there are no explanatory grounds for\nGod\u2019s existence; he is claiming that facts about God\u2019s\nnature explain the modality of God\u2019s existence. What about\nGod\u2019s nature explains God\u2019s existence? In Ip7 and Ip11,\nSpinoza appeals to an involvement relation between the concept of\nGod\u2019s essence and the concept of God\u2019s existence. That is,\nGod exists in virtue of the fact that the concept of God involves the\nconcept of existence. Spinoza also thinks that the conceptual\ninvolvement relation between God and existence explains the fact that\nGod necessarily exists. In Ip19d, Spinoza writes,\n\nFor God (by Id6) is substance, which (by Ip11) necessarily exists,\nthat is (by p7), to whose nature it pertains to exist, or (what is the\nsame) from whose definition it follows that he exists.\n\n\nIn Ip7, Spinoza equates \u201cpertaining to its nature to\nexist\u201d with \u201cessence necessarily involving\nexistence\u201d and \u201ccausing itself.\u201d Self-causation in\nturn is explained in Id1 as a \u201cnature that cannot be conceived\nexcept as existing.\u201d That is, what explains the necessity of\nGod\u2019s existence is the fact that the very concept of God\ninvolves the concept of existence. He repeats these connections in\nIp24d, \u201cFor that whose nature involves existence (considered in\nitself) is its own cause, and exists only from the necessity of its\nnature.\u201d In other words, Spinoza explains necessity in terms of\nconceptual connections. Although Spinoza does not develop a richer\naccount of conceptual relations that Leibniz will later achieve, his\ngeneral idea seems to be that conceptual relations are the relations\nthat explain and ground necessary connections.\n\nSpinoza makes similar appeals to conceptual relations when he invokes\ngeometrical examples to describe the necessity with which other things\nfollow from God:\n\n\u2026all things have necessarily flowed, or always follow, by the\nsame necessity and in the same way as from the nature of a triangle it\nfollows\u2026that its three angles are equal to two right angles\n(Ip17s).\n\n\nSpinoza later identifies this same geometrical relationship with the\nconceptual involvement relation (IIp49). What it is for things to\nfollow from God necessarily is for those things to be (asymmetrically)\nconceived through God, whose concept involves (the concept of)\nexistence. The necessity of God and the necessity of existing things\nare both explained by and grounded in conceptual relations. Spinoza\nmakes this connection emphatic in Ip35, \u201cWhatever we conceive to\nbe in God\u2019s power, necessarily exists.\u201d\n\nConversely, contingency obtains in virtue of the lack of certain\nconceptual connections. In the case of contingent existence, an object\nexists contingently just in case its concept is neither connected to\nthe concept of existence nor to something else whose concept is\nconnected to the concept of existence. Hence if a mode is\nconceived in such a way that it is not conceived in relation to\nsomething involving existence, it will exist contingently and not\nnecessarily (as per Ia7). The point is not just that it would be\nconceived as contingent. On this account, how a thing is\nconceived partly fixes its modal status. In explaining modal features\nin terms of an involvement relation between concepts, Spinoza provides\nan answer to (3) from the previous section and thereby identifies\nhimself with a long and distinguished tradition of philosophers who\nexplain modal facts by appeal to conceptual relations.\n\nThis account also explains why Spinoza is attracted to his modal\ntransfer principle in the first place. Recall that the modal transfer\nprinciple states that necessity transfers along following-from chains\nwhose nodes include at least one necessarily existing thing. We saw\nearlier that Spinoza\u2019s following-from relation is a causal\nrelation and that causal relations are conceptual relations for\nSpinoza. But we just saw that necessity is also partly a function of\nconceptual relations. Thus necessity transfers along following-from\nchains because both necessity and following-from are grounded in the\nsame relations of conceptual involvement. The underlying conceptual\nnature of modality, causation, and following-from explains why\nSpinoza\u2019s modal transfer principle works.\n\nAnother upshot of all this is that modality is not wholly extensional\nfor Spinoza. The ways in which objects are conceived partly determines\na thing\u2019s modal status. In particular, whether a finite mode\nexists necessarily or not depends in part on whether it is conceived\nthrough something whose concept involves existence. (For further\ndiscussion, see Newlands 2010b and Newlands 2017.)\n2.1 Necessitarianism Vindicated\n\nWith this analysis in hand, let us return to Garrett\u2019s proposed\naccount of Spinoza\u2019s necessitarianism. Garrett claims in [iv]\nthat each particular mode, conceived in relation to all the other\nparticular modes, follows from God\u2019s nature, and he concludes\nthat therefore every finite mode exists necessarily. However,\naccording to [v], the same finite mode conceived independently of the\nrelation to every other finite modes fails to follow from God and so\nfails to exist necessarily. Spinoza\u2019s conceptual account of\nmodality explains why he thought modality works in this particular\nway.\n\nSuppose the entire collection of finite modes, considered as a whole,\nfollows from a necessarily existing infinite mode. Hence, the entire\ncollection as a whole exists necessarily. In order for a particular\nfinite mode in that collection to exist necessarily, it must be\nconceived as following from something that exists necessarily. How can\na finite mode be conceived as following from something that exists\nnecessarily? The answer is clear: by being conceived in relation to\nthe whole collection. That is, when finite modes are considered in\nrelation to all the other finite modes, the right conceptual\nconnection obtains and Spinoza\u2019s modal transfer principle is\nsatisfied. This provides an answer to (2\u2032) from the previous\nsection. Whether a mode is considered in relation to the rest of the\nseries is relevant to its modal status because (a) modal facts are\nsensitive to the conceptual relations that the considering relation\npicks up on and (b) considering a particular finite mode in relation\nto the whole series of finite modes tracks the relevant conceptual\nconnection that satisfies the modal transfer principle.\n\nOf course, not just any way of considering a finite mode will be\nrelevant for its modal status. Considered as \u201cthe largest piece\nof furniture in the office,\u201d the desk does not exist\nnecessarily. By Spinoza\u2019s lights, the way of conceiving the desk\nneeds to involve something that follows from God\u2019s nature if the\ndesk is to exist necessarily. This is why, if Garrett is correct,\nconsidering the desk in relation to the rest of the entire series of\nfinite objects is relevant for its modal status, whereas considering\nthe desk in other, less causally relevant or more isolated ways, is\n not.[15]\n2.2 Non-necessitarianism also vindicated\n\nIf particular finite things exist necessarily in virtue of being\nconsidered in relation to the whole series of finite things, two\nlingering questions remain:\n\n(4) Can you and I ever grasp such all-encompassing ways of conceiving\nparticular things?\n\n\n(5) Are there other, less inclusive ways of considering a finite\nobject in virtue of which it does not exist necessarily?\n\n\nWith the respect to (4), Spinoza\u2019s answer is unfortunately\nnegative. Spinoza sometimes describes the mental corollary of these\nvery inclusive and complete ways of conceiving objects in terms of\nadequacy, and he is very pessimistic about our ability to\nhave adequate ideas of particular things (see especially\nIIp24\u201331, though he holds out more hope in Part Five). Spinoza\neven links our natural tendencies to represent objects independent of\ntheir infinitely extensive causal networks with their contingency\n(IIp31c), just as the above interpretation predicts. So while we can\nunderstand the metaphysical principles which guarantee the necessary\nexistence of a finite thing insofar as it is conceived in relation to\nevery other finite thing, we tend to adopt far more limited concepts\nof finite things, in virtue of which necessitarianism is false.\nSpinoza remains confident that there is a complete way of\nconceiving a particular finite object in relation to all others, but\nit is unlikely that we will ever be able to psychologically grasp such\ncomplete and necessitating concepts. Spinoza\u2019s\nmetaphysics meets his psychology here, and psychology wins.\n\nThis is an unfortunately negative answer in the light of\nSpinoza\u2019s ethical theory. As a systematic thinker, Spinoza\nthinks metaphysical conclusions about modality have consequences for\nethics. Although pursuing the relations between Spinoza\u2019s\nmetaphysics and ethics are beyond the scope of this entry (see\nNewlands 2018), Spinoza clearly thinks that ethically relevant\nconclusions follow from his metaphysics of modality. For example, he\nwrites in Vp6:\n\nInsofar as the mind understands all things as necessary, it has a\ngreater power over the affects, or is less acted on them.\n\n\nSpinoza thinks we morally improve by gaining power over our passive\naffects and becoming more active (Vp4), so our inability to conceive\nfinite things as related to everything else (and so as existing\nnecessarily) means our prospects for moral perfection are quite\ndim.\n\nWith respect to (5), Spinoza suggests that there are more and less\ncomplete ways of genuinely conceiving objects (see, for instance,\nIp24d and IVd3\u20134). If there are true but incomplete ways of\nconceiving objects, Spinoza will occupy the interesting position of\nconsistently affirming both necessitarianism and its denial, relative\nto these different ways of conceiving objects. This pairing sounds\nlike a contradiction until we appreciate the force of Spinoza\u2019s\nconceptualist account of modality. If the truth-value of modal\npredications is sensitive to ways of conceiving objects (as a modern\nday anti-essentialist might agree), and if Spinoza endorses a variety\nof modally salient ways of conceiving objects, then he can\nconsistently affirm both the truth and falsity of full-blown\nnecessitarianism relative to different ways of conceiving finite\nobjects.\n\nIf this is all correct (a very big \u201cif\u201d!), then Garrett\nand Curley\u2019s conclusions can both be right, though\nneither tells the complete modal story. Something less than full-blown\nnecessitarianism will be true in virtue of ways of conceiving objects\nthat do not include their relations to the entire, infinitely large\nand complex range of other particular things. At the same time,\nfull-blown necessitarianism will also be true in virtue of ways of\nconceiving finite things that are maximally inclusive with respect to\nrelations to the rest of the world. This middle ground provides an\nanswer to Curley\u2019s otherwise worrisome objection to the\nnecessitarian interpretation: \u201cIf each particular feature of the\nuniverse, considered in itself, is contingent, then their totality is\nalso contingent\u201d (Curley 1988,\n 49).[16]\n This expansion of contingency from the part to the whole would be\ntrue only if the shift in the ways finite things are conceived did not\nsometimes entail a shift in their modal status. Although this is a\nvery widespread essentialist assumption today, it is a false\none according to this reading of Spinoza\u2019s modal theory.\nJust as necessitarianism at the most expansive conceptual level does\nnot jeopardize contingency at narrower levels, so too contingency at\nnarrower levels need not bleed into the modal status of things\nconceived in the most expansive way.\n3. The Ground of Modality\n\nA final and underexplored topic in Spinoza\u2019s modal metaphysics\nconcerns what we might call the ground of modality. There was\na lively dispute in the 17th century about the relationship\nbetween God and modality. Although there was a general consensus that\nmodal facts \u2013 like so much else \u2013 depend on God in some\nway or other, there was considerable disagreement over exactly how to\nunderstand that dependence. Monotheistic metaphysicians disagreed over\nboth (a) on what in God modal truths and modal truth-makers depend and\n(b) by what manner of dependence modal truths and modal-truth makers\ndepend on God. The first set of issues concerns the divine\nground of modality and the second concerns the grounding\nrelation that modality bears to its ground (for some recent\ndiscussions, see Chignell 2012 and Newlands 2013).\n\nSpinoza cannot accept two of the most prominent accounts proposed by\nhis contemporaries. According to Descartes, (a) modal truths and modal\ntruth-makers depend on God\u2019s volitions and (b) the form of\ndependence is efficient causation. According to Leibniz, (a) modal\ntruths and modal truth-makers depend on God\u2019s ideas and\nintellectual activities and (b) the form of dependence is ontological\nand does not involve efficient causation. However, Spinoza denies that\nGod\u2019s nature contains a will and intellect in the sense required\nfor these accounts (Ip17s).\n\nNonetheless, Spinoza thinks that all things depend on God (Ip15),\nand he points to an alternative account of how possibilities depend on\nGod. He claims that non-existing modes are grounded in God\u2019s\nactual attributes. \u201cThe ideas of singular things, or of modes,\nthat do not exist must be comprehended God\u2019s infinite idea in\nthe same way as the formal essences of singular things, or modes, are\ncontained in God\u2019s attributes\u201d (IIp8). He unpacks the\n\u201ccomprehension\u201d or containment of non-divine formal\nessences in conceptual terms: \u201cEssences [of non-existing things]\nare comprehended in another in such a way that they can be conceived\nthrough it\u201d (Ip8s2). This suggests that the essences of all\nthings, including non-existing things, are conceptually contained in\nGod\u2019s attributes.\n\nIn more general terms, Spinoza\u2019s idea seems to be that\npossibilities are grounded in God by being actually exemplified by\nGod, a view that fits nicely with interpretations of Spinoza\u2019s\nmodes as things that inhere in God (see section 1.3 above). Thus, it\nis possible for something to be thinking because God is actually a\nthinking thing (IIp1d). The grounding of possibility in actuality is a\nvery attractive metaphysical thesis in its own right, and\nSpinoza\u2019s God has a sufficiently rich nature to ground all\npossibilities by actually exemplifying them all (Ip15 and Ip16).\n\nSpinoza\u2019s account of the grounds of modality also presents an\ninteresting challenge to anyone attracted to the thesis that God\ngrounds possibilities, but who wants to deny that God directly\nexemplifies every possibility (Newlands 2016). Those unhappy with\nSpinoza\u2019s expansive divine nature would need to explain how it\nis that God grounds some possibilities, such as being extended,\nwithout actually being extended. One could follow Descartes in\nharkening back to the Scholastic notion of \u201ceminent\u201d\ncontainment, but Spinoza reads that appeal as the name of the problem,\nnot its solution. Leibniz was sometimes attracted to the idea that\nevery basic creaturely possibility is formed from God\u2019s\nnon-mental perfections, but he will have a hard time explaining\nhow every creaturely possibility can be constructed out of the sparse\nset of traditional divine perfections.\n\nWithout reducing creaturely possibilities to God\u2019s actual\nperfections (as idealists do with extension), Spinoza presents an\nalternative grounding thesis and a challenge. Let every possibility be\ngrounded in God via actual exemplification, even if this requires\nexpanding the divine nature beyond its traditional boundaries. For\nthose unwilling to follow Spinoza on this expansion, Spinoza\u2019s\nchallenge is for proponents of nearby alternatives to provide a\nnon-metaphorical explanation of how God grounds certain basic\npossibilities without actually and directly exemplifying them. Until\nsuch an account is given, Spinoza\u2019s biting conclusion offers an\nunmet challenge: \u201cBut by what divine power could [extension or\nany property not exemplified by God] be created? They are completely\nignorant of that. And this shows that they do not understand what they\nthemselves say\u201d (Ip15s). At the very least, Spinoza\u2019s\nchallenge highlights how his modal metaphysics extends beyond the\ntopic of necessitarianism and continues to invite wider\ninvestigation.",
