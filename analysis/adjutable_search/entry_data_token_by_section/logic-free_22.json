    "main_text": "Some Applications || Meinongian Logics\n6. History\n\nInclusive logic was conceived and formalized before free logic per\nse was. Thus, since inclusive logic with singular terms is de\nfacto free, the inventors of inclusive logics were, perhaps\nunwittingly, the inventors of free logic. Bertrand Russell suggested\nthe idea of an inclusive logic in (1919, p. 201, n.). Andrezej\nMostowski (1951) seems to have been among the first to formalize such\na logic. But Morscher and Simons (2001, p. 27, note 3) document\nearlier discussions of the idea, and Bencivenga (2014) holds that\nJa\u015bkowski (1934) contains, at least implicitly, the first\ninclusive logic. Theodore Hailperin (1953), Czeslaw Lejewski (1954)\nand W. V. O. Quine (1954) made important early contributions. It was\nQuine who dubbed such logics \u201cinclusive.\u201d\n\nHenry S. Leonard (1956) was the first to develop a free logic per\nse, though he used a defective definition of \u2018E!\u2019.\nKarel Lambert began his prolific series of contributions to the field\nin (1958), critiquing Leonard\u2019s definition, and then coining the\nterm \u201cfree logic\u201d in (1960). The early systems of free\nlogic were positive. Negative free logic was developed by Rolf Schock\nin a series of papers during the 1960s, culminating in (1968). Timothy\nSmiley suggested the idea of a neutral free logic in (1960), but the\nfirst thoroughgoing treatment appeared in Lehman 1994. Supervaluations\nwere described in Mehlberg 1958, pp. 256\u2013260, as a device for\nhandling, not neutral free logic, but vagueness. But their\nformalization and application to free logic began with van Fraassen\n1966, in which the term \u201csupervaluation\u201d was introduced.\nDual-domain semantics were discussed in lectures by Lambert, Nuel\nBelnap and others as early as the late 1950s, but it appears that\nChurch 1965 and Cocchiarella 1966 were the first published\naccounts.\n",
