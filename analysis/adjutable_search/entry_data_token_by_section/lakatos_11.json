It argues\nthat the methodology of scientific research programmes can explain the\nCopernican Revolution as a rational process by which an earlier theory\n(Ptolemy\u2019s geocentric theory of the Cosmos) was dethroned in\nfavour another objectively better one (Copernicus\u2019s heliocentric\ntheory). It thus demonstrates the rationality of the Copernican\nRevolution (one of the most dramatic episodes in the history of\nthought) and confirms the MSRP as a theory of scientific rationality\n(so long as we accept the inductive principle that the more\n\u201cgreat science\u201d that a demarcation criterion can represent\nas rational, the more likely it is to be correct).\n\nApart from the intrinsic interest of the subject, the paper marks a\nmodification of Lakatos\u2019s conception of factual novelty and\nhence a modification to the MSRP. For the earlier Lakatos, a fact\ncounts as novel with respect to a research programme if it is not\npredicted by any of its rivals and if it is not already known. In\nWDCRPSP Lakatos accepts an amendment due to his co-author Elie Zahar.\nZahar\u2019s original problem was our old friend the Precession of\nMercury. This was explained by Einstein\u2019s\nprogramme\u2014specifically the General Theory of\nRelativity\u2014but not by Newton\u2019s, and this was generally\nthought to count in Einstein\u2019s favour. The difficulty is that in\nLakatos\u2019s lexicon the Precession of Mercury did not count as a\nnovel fact. After all it had been known to astronomers for nearly a\ncentury. Thus, given the original version of the MSRP, the discovery\nthat that the General Theory could explain the Precession of Mercury\n(whilst Newton\u2019s theory could not) did not mean that\nEinstein\u2019s programme was any more progressive than\nNewton\u2019s. (That had to be argued on other grounds.) But\nthis is such a counterintuitive result that it suggests a defect in\nthe MSRP. Zahar\u2019s modification is that a fact counts as a novel\nprediction with respect to a research programme if a) it is not\npredicted by any of the programme\u2019s rivals and b) either it is\nnot already known or if it is already known, the\nhard core of the programme was not devised to explain it.\n\nBy this modified criterion the Precession of Mercury counts as a novel\nfact with respect to Einstein\u2019s programme. For the General\nTheory was designed to solve a different set of problems. The\nprediction that if the General Theory were correct, the perihelion of\nMercury would shift as it does without the influence of any other\nheavenly body came as an \u201cunexpected present from\nSchwarzschild\u201d (the man who did the sums). It was therefore\n\u201can unintended by-product of Einstein\u201ds programme\u2019\n(WDCRPSP: 185). So despite its antiquity, the Precession of Mercury\ncounts as a novel fact or a novel prediction with respect to\nEinstein\u2019s programme, thus making the programme a lot more\nprogressive. Some might regard Zahar\u2019s amendment as a\nsuspiciously ad hoc move, but ad hoc or not, it\nlooks like an improvement on the original MSRP. Lakatos and Zahar go\non to use this idea to explain why Copernicus\u2019s programme very\nproperly superseded Ptolemy\u2019s.\n",
