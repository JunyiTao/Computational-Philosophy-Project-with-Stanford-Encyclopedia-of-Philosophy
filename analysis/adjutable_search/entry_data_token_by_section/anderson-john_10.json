One of Anderson\u2019s students, a young man from the\nPacific island of Tonga, Futa Helu, later claimed that John\nAnderson\u2019s realism had revolutionised his thinking, particularly\nwith reference to the notion of \u201ctapu\u201d or the sacred, as\nthe cover-up for the special demands of the ruling class in Tonga.\nReturning to Tonga in the early 1960s, he founded the Atenisi (Athens)\nInstitute as an independent high school based on the ideals of Greek\nphilosophy. He added \u201cAtenisi University\u201d in 1975, where\nthe philosophical thought of Heraclitus as interpreted by Anderson\nbecame the backbone of philosophy courses. Following Anderson\u2019s\nexample of public engagement, Helu is credited as one of the\nintellectual architects of the democracy movement in Tonga (Keith\nCampbell, personal communication).\n\nAnderson\u2019s influence on the self-styled \u201cSydney\nPush\u201d is more widely known. The latter was a diffuse sub-culture\nof anarchist libertarians who met around Sydney\u2019s inner city in\nthe 1950s and 1960s. Members were imbued with a spirit of\nanti-careerism, and a major influence in their meetings, talks and\ndrinking sessions was the philosophy of John Anderson who had lectured\nmany of them on the value of risk, endeavour, withdrawal from\nconsumerist society and the overriding value of criticism to the\nhealth of a society. Through his influence on many of these figures,\nAnderson affected the tone of intellectual debate and discussion in\nSydney and beyond. If the key figures of the movement are relatively\nunknown, there were more famous figures who moved through this\nenvironment and were on their own accounts deeply affected by its\nintellectual stimulus: such figures as Germaine Greer, Robert Hughes\nand Clive James.\n\nMore centrally involved with the life of the Push over an extended\nperiod and more particularly with the direct teachings of John\nAnderson was the anarchist activist and philosopher George Molnar. He\nattended Anderson\u2019s lectures in the 1950s and was active in\ndebates on metaphysical questions in the 1960s associated with\nArmstrong and C. B. Martin. Students recall Armstrong and Molnar in\nthe university quadrangle around 1970 arguing about dispositions and\npowers with an intensity no doubt propelled by their political\ndisagreements at the time. Molnar conducted courses on anarchism and\neducation theory in the early 1970s but in 1976 resigned his position\nat the university, a move consistent with the anti-careerist ethos of\nthe Push and of the radical politics of the time. Perhaps he also\nfound his philosophical interests on the wrong side of an\nirreconcilable split within the department. Some thirty years later,\nhe returned to academic life to take up a part-time position as John\nAnderson Research Fellow at the University of Sydney, but died\nunexpectedly in 2002. His book Powers: a study in metaphysics\nwas published posthumously in 2007 by Oxford University Press at the\nurging of his old adversary D. M. Armstrong.\n",
