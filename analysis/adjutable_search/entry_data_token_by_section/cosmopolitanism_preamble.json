    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe word \u2018cosmopolitan\u2019, which derives from the Greek\nword kosmopolit\u0113s (\u2018citizen of the world\u2019),\nhas been used to describe a wide variety of important views in moral\nand socio-political philosophy. The nebulous core shared by all\ncosmopolitan views is the idea that all human beings, regardless of\ntheir political affiliation, are (or can and should be) citizens in a\nsingle community. Different versions of cosmopolitanism envision this\ncommunity in different ways, some focusing on political institutions,\nothers on moral norms or relationships, and still others focusing on\nshared markets or forms of cultural expression. In most versions of\ncosmopolitanism, the universal community of world citizens functions\nas a positive ideal to be cultivated, but a few versions exist in\nwhich it serves primarily as a ground for denying the existence of\nspecial obligations to local forms of political\norganizations. Versions of cosmopolitanism also vary depending on the\nnotion of citizenship they employ, including whether they use the\nnotion of \u2018world citizenship\u2019 literally or metaphorically. The\nphilosophical interest in cosmopolitanism lies in its challenge to\ncommonly recognized attachments to fellow-citizens, the local state,\nparochially shared cultures, and the like.\n",
