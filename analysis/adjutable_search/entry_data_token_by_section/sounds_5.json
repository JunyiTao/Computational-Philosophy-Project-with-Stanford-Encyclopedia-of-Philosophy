    "main_text": "Medial Theories of Sounds || Sounds as Waves\n2.2 Sounds as Waves\n\nThe wave account is, of course, endorsed by modern acoustics. Sounds\nare construed as mechanical vibrations transmitted by an elastic\nmedium. They are thus described as longitudinal waves, defined by\ntheir frequency and amplitude. A vibrating object (the sound source,\nsuch as a moving vocal chord or a vibrating tuning fork) creates a\ndisturbance in the surrounding medium (say, air, or water). Each\nparticle of the medium is set in back-and-forth motion at a given\nfrequency and with a given amplitude, and the motion propagates to\nneighboring particles at the same frequency, undergoing an energy loss\nthat entails a decrease in amplitude. Seen macroscopically, the\npropagation of sound is the propagation of a compression in the medium\nfollowed by a depression, that is, the propagation of a wave. The\nbehavior of each particle is described by a sinusoid that maps the\ncyclical pattern of compressions and depressions against time. A cycle\nis the complete path of the sinusoid from crease to crease, at the end\nof which the particle is back to its starting position. Amplitude is\nthe distance between creases and valleys in the sinusoid, period is\nthe distance between a crease and its successor, and frequency is the\nnumber of cycles per time unit.\n\nContemporary philosophers of perception of the physicalist strand tend\nto align themselves on the wave theory (Nudds 2010b, 2018; Kalderon\n2017; Meadows 2018). Perkins thus summarizes the view:\n\u201c\u2026the sound we hear is identical with the train of\nairwaves that stretches from the distant sounding object to our\near\u201d (1983: 168). And indeed, the physicalist account of sounds\nseems to make a good claim to successful reduction of key auditory\nphenomena based on the identification of sounds with sound waves in a\nmedium in which a sounding object (and possibly a hearer) is\npresent.\n",
