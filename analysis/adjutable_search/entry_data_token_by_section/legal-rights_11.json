    "main_text": "Legal Rights in Legal Justification and Reasoning: Outcomes and Reasons\n6. Legal Rights in Legal Justification and Reasoning: Outcomes and Reasons\n\nRights figure in legal reasoning in two very different ways. At times,\nlegal rights are part of legal justification and reasoning,\nfunctioning as legal reasons in favor of a certain legal holding or\nrule. In other instances, legal rights are themselves the outcome or\nthe \u201cbottom line\u201d of legal reasoning, embodying a legal\nholding or a rule justified by reasons other than the right itself.\n\n\nConsider the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Finnis\n2011: 210\u2013213). Some of the Declaration\u2019s articles secure\nall persons with certain rights (e.g., to liberty, life, own\nproperty), yet those rights are subject to limitations given\nconflicting values, such as for the purpose of securing the rights of\nothers, general welfare, and public order (Article 29 [2]).\nAccordingly, such rights appear set up as reasons in favor of certain\nlegal positions, to be assessed against other competing\nconsiderations. In contrast, other articles of the Declaration state\nrights as prohibitions, such as in terms of \u201cno one shall be\nsubject to\u201d, for example, torture or servitude, or \u201cno one\nshall be deprived of\u201d, for example, property or liberty. Some of\nthese prohibitions are qualified, while others are not. Regardless,\nwhere applicable, these articles provide rights that appear\nconclusory.\n\nA right can figure both as outcome and a reason, even in the same\nlegal decision or legal context. As such, rights can seem\n\u201cintermediate conclusions\u201d (Raz 1986: 181). As\n\u201coutcomes\u201d, rights are legal norms resulting from or\njustified by the intersection or counter-weighting of different\nreasons. Yet, under this view, such outcomes are not legal bottom\nlines but rather \u201cintermediate\u201d outcomes, which are\nthemselves reasons for legal duties or other legal positions. For\ninstance, a judge may hold that a litigant\u2019s interest in \u03c6\njustifies her right to \u03c6, and then further deliberate whether or\nnot to give effect to that right by imposing a remedial duty grounded\nin one\u2019s right to \u03c6. \n",
