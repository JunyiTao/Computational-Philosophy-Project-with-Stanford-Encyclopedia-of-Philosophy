    "main_text": "Conditional Principles || Synchronic Reflection and Self-Respect\n2.1 Synchronic Reflection and Self-Respect\n\nWe might do better at understanding the relations rationality requires\nbetween your beliefs and your beliefs about them by adding to the\nrequirements of consistency and coherence a bridge principle between\nthe two orders expressed via conditional (subjective) probability.\nConditional probabilities say what your degree of belief in one\nproposition is (should be) given another proposition, here the\nrelevant propositions being a first-order proposition q, and\nthe proposition that one has degree of belief x in q,\nrespectively. A first pass at how to represent a situation where my\nbeliefs at the two levels don\u2019t match comes from its apparent\nconflict with the synchronic instance of the Reflection Principle (van\nFraassen 1984).\n\n\nReflection\n\n\\(P_0 (q\\mid P_1 (q) = x) = x \\) \n\n\nReflection says that my current self\u2019s degree of belief in\nq given that my future self will believe it to degree x\nshould be x. It is implied by the fact that her degrees of\nbelief are represented as probabilities that my future self is\ncoherent, but that alone does not rule out the possibility that her\njudgment is compromised in some other way\u2014as for example when\nUlysses anticipated that he would be entranced by the Sirens\u2014and\nthe principle can be questioned for such cases (Sobel 1987;\nChristensen 1991; van Fraassen 1995). However, the self-doubt we are\nimagining is one that the subject has about her current beliefs, and\nthe synchronic version of Reflection\n\n\nSynchronic Reflection (SR)\n\n\\(P_{0}(q\\mid P_{0}(q)=x) = x \\) \n\n\nwhich says that my degree of belief in q now given that I now\nbelieve q to degree x should be x, seems less\nopen to question. Christensen (2007b) also calls this principle\nSelf-Respect (SR). This is not the tautology that if I believe\nq to degree x then I believe q to degree\nx, for in a logically equivalent form the principle is\n\n\nSynchronic Reflection/Self-Respect (SR)\n\n\\([P_{0}(q \\amp P_{0}(q)=x)\\mid P_{0}(P_{0}(q)=x)] = x \\) \n\n\nwhich does not follow from either deductive logic or the probability\naxioms alone. But SR has been widely endorsed as unobjectionable, and\naccording to some even undeniable, as a requirement of rationality\n(van Fraassen 1984: 248; Vickers 2000: 160; Koons 1992:\n23\u2014Skyrms 1980 sees\nas useful a version of it he calls Miller\u2019s Principle, though he\nalso shows it is subject to counterexamples).\n\nWhile I can sensibly imagine my future self to be epistemically\ncompromised, unworthy of my deference, violating SR would require\nregarding my current self as epistemically compromised, as having a\ndegree of belief that should be other than it is. This appears to be\nsomething that doubt of my own judgment would call for, in which case\nwhether self-doubt can be rational depends on whether SR is a\nrequirement of rationality.\n\nSR can be defended as a rational ideal by Dutch Strategy arguments,\nthough not by the strongest kind of Dutch Book argument (Sobel 1987;\nChristensen 1991, 2007b: 328\u2013330, 2010b; Briggs 2010\u2014Roush\n2016 argues it can\u2019t be defended as a requirement by a\nDutch book argument at all). It has been argued to be questionable if\nnot false on grounds that it conflicts with the Epistemic\nImpartiality Principle that says we should not in general take\nthe mere fact that we have a belief as a reason to have that belief\nany more so than we do with the mere fact that others have that belief\n(Christensen 2000: 363\u20134; Evnine 2008: 139\u2013143; Roush\n 2016).[1]\n\nNevertheless the probabilist\u2014one who thinks that rationality\nrequires probabilistic coherence\u2014will have a difficult time\nresisting SR since, analogously to what we saw above with\nanti-expertise, SR follows from coherence if it is supplemented with\nthe further assumption that the subject has perfect knowledge of her\nown beliefs. Still, this does little to explain intuitively why SR\nshould be binding; even someone who has perfect knowledge that he has\na belief should be able to sensibly wonder whether it is a belief he\nought to have. That perfect knowledge of our beliefs is a requirement\nof rationality can be doubted in a variety of ways (Williamson 2000;\nChristensen 2007b: 327\u2013328; Roush 2016). However, as\nabove so for the discussion here, denying that rationality requires\nknowledge of our own beliefs does not overcome the problem.\nSelf-correction that will be of any use requires some degree of\naccuracy about one\u2019s beliefs, and even if a subject\ndoesn\u2019t have perfect self-knowledge coherence still makes\nreflective demands; Christensen (2007b: 332) has noted that the closer\na coherent subject comes to perfect knowledge of his beliefs the more\nnearly he will satisfy SR.\n\nSR has something to recommend it, but it seems to be a rule a\nself-doubter will violate. Consider our underslept doctor. It looks as\nif once it is pointed out to her how long it has been since she slept,\nshe should regard her current confidence in q, her diagnosis of\nembolism, as higher than it ought to be. I.e., she would instantiate a\nprinciple we could call Refraction:\n\n\nRefraction\n\n\\(P_{0}(q\\mid P_{0}(q)=x) < x \\) \n\n\nApparently, her degree of belief that it\u2019s an embolism given\nthat she has degree of belief x that it\u2019s an embolism\nshould be less than x, contradicting SR. Or imagine that the\nperson who tells me a hallucinogenic drug has been slipped into my\ncoffee is a trusted friend who is neither in the habit of joking nor\ncurrently smirking. I seem to have an obligation to\nregard some of my current degrees of belief as higher than they should\nbe.\n\nRefraction is a way of representing a state of self-doubt, one in\nwhich I don\u2019t regard the degree of belief I (think I) have as\nthe right one to have. But despite the fact that it doesn\u2019t have\nthe subject attributing unreliability to herself categorically as we\nhad in the last section, Refraction is not compatible with the\ncombination of coherence and knowledge of one\u2019s beliefs, since\nthe latter two together imply SR. In this representation of what\nself-doubt is, it is not rational according to the probabilistic\nstandard.\n\nOne might defend this verdict by saying that the exception proves the\nrule: if I really think that my degree of belief in q should be\ndifferent than it is, say because I realize I am severely underslept,\nthen surely I should change it accordingly until I come to a credence\nI do approve of, at which point I will satisfy SR. However even if it\nis ideal to be in the state of self-respect that SR describes, it\nseems wrong to say that a state of disapproving of one\u2019s\nfirst-order belief when faced with evidence of one\u2019s impaired\njudgment is irrational. In such a case it would seem to be irrational\nnot to be in a state of self-doubt. Moreover, it is unclear\nhow a revision from a state violating SR to one in conformity with SR\ncan be rational. According to many probabilists the rational way to\nrevise beliefs is via conditionalization, where one\u2019s new\ndegrees of belief come from what one\u2019s previous function said\nthey should be given the new belief that prompts the revision (see\nentries on\n interpretations of probability\n and\n Bayes\u2019 Theorem).\n That is, all change of belief is determined by the conditional\nprobabilities of the function one is changing from. Thus change of\nbelief on the basis of a belief about what my belief is will depend on\nthe value of \\(P_i(q\\mid P_i(q) = x)\\). If the value of \\(P_i(q\\mid\nP_i(q)=x)\\) isn\u2019t already x then a conditionalization\nusing that conditional probability will not necessarily make\n\\(P_f(q\\mid P_f(q)=x) = x\\), as required by SR, and it is hard to see\nhow it could. In this approach, similarly to the previous, the whole\ncycle of epistemic self-doubt and resolution appears to be unavailable\nto a probabilistically rational subject.\n\nIf we represent epistemic self-doubt as a violation of Synchronic\nReflection (Self-Respect), then it is not rational for a coherent\nperson who knows what her beliefs are. This is a general rule giving\nthe same verdict in all cases, that the orders must match, and it\ngives the form of that matching in terms of a conditional probability.\nThe second-order is in the driving seat since the condition in\nSR\u2019s conditional probability that determines a value for the\nfirst-order proposition q is itself a statement of probability,\nbut SR can\u2019t lead to change of first-order belief unless one\ndoes not know what one\u2019s belief in q is. As in the\napproach via categorical statements above, this simple approach via\nconditional probability does not represent the cycle of self-doubt and\nresolution as available to a rational subject.\n",
