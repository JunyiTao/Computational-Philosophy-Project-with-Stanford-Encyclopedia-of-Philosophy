    "main_text": "What is Constructivism?\n1. What is Constructivism?\n\nThe term \u2018constructivism\u2019 entered debates in moral theory\nwith John Rawls\u2019 seminal Dewey Lectures \u201cKantian\nConstructivism in Moral Theory\u201d (Rawls 1980), wherein Rawls\noffered a reinterpretation of the philosopher Immanuel Kant\u2019s\nethics and of its relevance for political debates.\n\nAccording to Rawls, these debates fail to effectively address the\npolitical problem of ethical disagreements because they adopt\nmetaphysical standards of objectivity, which appeal to the independent\nreality and truth of values. In his view, such standards are\ninadequate to address disagreement in a political debate in which all\nthe parties in the dispute claim to be defending the only true view,\nbecause they lead to a stalemate in the discussion, with each party\naccusing its opponent of being \u2018blind\u2019 to the moral\ntruth.\n\nRawls is especially concerned with coordination problems that arise in\npluralistic contexts, wherein citizens hold different and to some\nextent incommensurable moral views. The need for objectivity,\naccording to Rawls, is practical: it arises in contexts in\nwhich people disagree about what to value and need to reach an\nagreement about what to do. He attributes to Kant the idea that we\nought to approach objectivity as a practical problem and that we can\nfruitfully address moral disputes by reasoning about them (Rawls 1971:\n34, 39\u201340, 49\u201352). Rawls thus turns to Kant in order to\nargue for a conception of objectivity that is not metaphysical, that\nis, a conception of objectivity that avoids claims to universal and\nfundamental moral truths that are independent of our fully rational\njudgments. On this conception, nobody is assumed to have a privileged\naccess to moral truth, but all have equal standing in reasoning about\nwhat to do. To this extent, Kant\u2019s theory is regarded as\nproviding a metaethical alternative both to realism and skepticism\nabout the existence and nature of moral truths.\n\nRawls\u2019 account of Kantian constructivism in moral theory (1980)\ngenerated a large literature, and produced several varieties of\nconstructivism. Some of these views depart from Rawls\u2019\nconception of constructivism.\n",
