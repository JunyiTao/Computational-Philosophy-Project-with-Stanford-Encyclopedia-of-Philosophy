    "main_text": "Selves: Human and Divine || An Argument for the Existence of the Human Self\n4.2 An Argument for the Existence of the Human Self\n\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika defines the human self as the substratum of such\npsychological qualities as believing, etc., as well as of happiness\nand other emotions, which God does not have. There is an implicit\nappeal, here too, to the \u201cpotter\u201d model of causation: just\nas, in the sentence \u201cThe potter makes the pot\u201d, the\nproperty \u201c\u2026.making the pot\u201d resides in the potter,\nso too in \u201cI believe that p\u201d, the property\n\u201c\u2026.believes that p\u201d resides in me. Given\nthat the self is defined as that substance, whichever it is, in which\na person\u2019s psychological qualities reside, the question is\nwhether we can identify this substance as a physical one, for example,\nthe person\u2019s body or their senses, or whether we must postulate\nsome new type of substance. Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\u2019s argument for\nthe existence of the self as a new substance is by elimination of two\nrival candidates.\n\n(1) The substratum of beliefs, etc. is the person\u2019s body.\nThe Manual of Reason makes the case for this as follows: If I\nsay, \u201cI am cold\u201d, \u201cI am running\u201d, it is my\nbody to which the predicate applies. Therefore, when I say \u201cI\nbelieve that p\u201d, the subject likewise is my body.\nThe Manual\u2019s reply is that if this were true, then\n\nthere would be the difficulty that with the destruction of a hand, a\nfoot, etc., there will be the destruction of the body and it will\nfollow that there will also be the destruction of the self.\n\n\nClearly, I can lose part of my body without ceasing to believe and\nknow things. But losing part of my body does not entail losing my\nbody, as a whole. So this argument fails. A better argument is found\nin the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra: the very phrase \u201cmy\nbody\u201d shows that I am not identical with my body. But this\ndoesn\u2019t work either, for I can also say \u201cmy soul\u201d!\nThere is no clear argument against physicalism here.\n\n(2) The substratum of beliefs etc. is the person\u2019s\nsense-faculties [recall that every physical substance was divided into\nthree: pertaining to body, sense-faculty, and (inanimate) object].\nThis rather strange claim might be taken to include the view of the\nBuddhists, that a person is reducible to a stream of momentary mental\nevents, including sense-data etc. The Manual of\nReason\u2019s argument against such a view (a repetition of an\nargument already found in the Ny\u0101ya-sutra) is a strong\none:\n\nWere this the case, there would be no re-identifying awareness\n(anusandh\u0101na), e.g. \u201cI who saw that pot am now\ntouching it\u201d, for there cannot be any recognition by one of what\nis apprehended by another.\n\n\nThe idea here is that the possibility of recognitive experience\npresupposes the existence of a unitary enduring self. There are really\ntwo arguments compressed here. One is this: I cannot remember\nan object unless I have seen it earlier\u2014I cannot remember what\nyou have seen (cf. Locke\u2019s account of personal identity in terms\nof a continuity of memory experiences). The other argument is more\nintricate. The Abhidharma Buddhist claims that a person is just an\naggregate of experiences, some visual, some tactile, etc. The problem\nraised for such an account by the Naiy\u0101yika is that it is\npossible to make trans-modality judgements, in which the deliverances\nof one sense-faculty are compared with another. Suppose that\nV(o1) is a visual experience of an object\no1, and T(o2) is a\ntactile experience of an object o2. It is possible\nto judge \u201co1 =\no2\u201d, but this judgement does not belong to\nthe sphere of any one sense-faculty. Hence, it must be located in some\nother substance. The self is here conceived of as that which collates,\norganises and compares the deliverances of the individual senses. See\nGaneri 2012, chapters 11, 15, 16 for an expanded discussion.\n\nThis is a convenient place at which to introduce the last of the nine\nsubstances, the \u2018mind\u2019 (manas). It is defined by\nThe Manual of Reason (TS18) as a sixth sense-faculty, one by\nwhich a person \u2018perceives\u2019 their inner mental objects\n(beliefs, pleasure sensations etc.) In other words, it is a faculty of\nintrospection. Naturally, we need an argument why this faculty cannot\nbe identified as belonging to the self, and the usual Ny\u0101ya claim\nis that the self is the agent of cognising, while the mind is an\ninstrument for cognising, just as we must distinguish between the\naxe-man, who is the agent chopping the tree, and the axe, which is the\ninstrument for chopping. The Ny\u0101ya also claim that the mind has\nanother function, which is to \u2018switch\u2019 between the\ndifferent sense-faculties, it being assumed that, while we are being\nsubjected to sense-impressions from different faculties\nsimultaneously, we only attend to one at a time.\n\nThe Manual of Reason (TS 79) says that eight of the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika qualities reside only in the self, and in no\nother substance. They are cognition, memory, pleasure or happiness\n(sukha), pain or unhappiness (du\u1e25kha), desire\n(icch\u0101), aversion (dve\u1e63a), merit\n(dharma) and demerit (adharma) (TS 73\u201378). The\nfirst two we will discuss later (\u00a7\u00a7 5.2\u20133). As regards\nhappiness and unhappiness, Matilal (1986: 301), summarizes the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika view when he says that \u201cthe essential\ncharacteristic of pleasure or happiness consists in its being\nexperienced as favourable to us or being in accord with us, i.e. with\nour body or mind or our very existential situation\n(anuk\u016bla)\u201d, which makes it distinct from knowing\nor perceiving or apprehending something, and that it is an\n\u201cinner disposition on account of which the external world\nbecomes agreeable or desirable\u201d. Desire is the state of craving\nfor something. Merit is that which is produces by meritorious action\n(karma). See further Ganeri 2012, chapters 13, 14.\n",
