The Word \u2018Metaphysics\u2019 and the Concept of Metaphysics\n\nThe word \u2018metaphysics\u2019 is notoriously hard to define.\nTwentieth-century coinages like \u2018meta-language\u2019 and\n\u2018metaphilosophy\u2019 encourage the impression that metaphysics\nis a study that somehow \u201cgoes beyond\u201d physics, a study\ndevoted to matters that transcend the mundane concerns of Newton and\nEinstein and Heisenberg. This impression is mistaken. The word\n\u2018metaphysics\u2019 is derived from a collective title of the\nfourteen books by Aristotle that we currently think of as making up\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics. Aristotle himself did not know\nthe word. (He had four names for the branch of philosophy that is the\nsubject-matter of Metaphysics: \u2018first philosophy\u2019,\n\u2018first science\u2019, \u2018wisdom\u2019, and\n\u2018theology\u2019.) At least one hundred years after\nAristotle\u2019s death, an editor of his works (in all probability,\nAndronicus of Rhodes) titled those fourteen books \u201cTa meta\nta phusika\u201d\u2014\u201cthe after the physicals\u201d or\n\u201cthe ones after the physical ones\u201d\u2014the\n\u201cphysical ones\u201d being the books contained in what we now\ncall Aristotle\u2019s Physics. The title was probably meant\nto warn students of Aristotle\u2019s philosophy that they should\nattempt Metaphysics only after they had mastered \u201cthe physical\nones\u201d, the books about nature or the natural world\u2014that is\nto say, about change, for change is the defining feature of the\nnatural world.\n\nThis is the probable meaning of the title because Metaphysics\nis about things that do not change. In one place, Aristotle identifies\nthe subject-matter of first philosophy as \u201cbeing as such\u201d,\nand, in another as \u201cfirst causes\u201d. It is a nice\u2014and\nvexed\u2014question what the connection between these two definitions\nis. Perhaps this is the answer: The unchanging first causes have\nnothing but being in common with the mutable things they cause. Like\nus and the objects of our experience\u2014they are, and there the\nresemblance ceases. (For a detailed and informative recent guide to\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, see Politis 2004.)\n\nShould we assume that \u2018metaphysics\u2019 is a name for that\n\u201cscience\u201d which is the subject-matter of Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics? If we assume this, we should be committed to\nsomething in the neighborhood of the following theses:\n\nThe subject-matter of metaphysics is \u201cbeing as\nsuch\u201d\nThe subject-matter of metaphysics is the first causes of\nthings\nThe subject-matter of metaphysics is that which does not\nchange\n\n\nAny of these three theses might have been regarded as a defensible\nstatement of the subject-matter of what was called\n\u2018metaphysics\u2019 until the seventeenth century. But then,\nrather suddenly, many topics and problems that Aristotle and the\nMedievals would have classified as belonging to physics (the relation\nof mind and body, for example, or the freedom of the will, or personal\nidentity across time) began to be reassigned to metaphysics. One might\nalmost say that in the seventeenth century metaphysics began to be a\ncatch-all category, a repository of philosophical problems that could\nnot be otherwise classified as epistemology, logic, ethics or other\nbranches of philosophy. (It was at about that time that the word\n\u2018ontology\u2019 was invented\u2014to be a name for the science\nof being as such, an office that the word \u2018metaphysics\u2019\ncould no longer fill.) The academic rationalists of the\npost-Leibnizian school were aware that the word\n\u2018metaphysics\u2019 had come to be used in a more inclusive\nsense than it had once been. Christian Wolff attempted to justify this\nmore inclusive sense of the word by this device: while the\nsubject-matter of metaphysics is being, being can be investigated\neither in general or in relation to objects in particular categories.\nHe distinguished between \u2018general metaphysics\u2019 (or\nontology), the study of being as such, and the various branches of\n\u2018special metaphysics\u2019, which study the being of objects of\nvarious special sorts, such as souls and material bodies. (He does not\nassign first causes to general metaphysics, however: the study of\nfirst causes belongs to natural theology, a branch of special\nmetaphysics.) It is doubtful whether this maneuver is anything more\nthan a verbal ploy. In what sense, for example, is the practitioner of\nrational psychology (the branch of special metaphysics devoted to the\nsoul) engaged in a study of being? Do souls have a different sort of\nbeing from that of other objects?\u2014so that in studying the soul\none learns not only about its nature (that is, its properties:\nrationality, immateriality, immortality, its capacity or lack thereof\nto affect the body \u2026), but also about its \u201cmode of\nbeing\u201d, and hence learns something about being? It is certainly\nnot true that all, or even very many, rational psychologists said\nanything, qua rational psychologists, that could plausibly be\nconstrued as a contribution to our understanding of being.\n\nPerhaps the wider application of the word \u2018metaphysics\u2019\nwas due to the fact that the word \u2018physics\u2019 was coming to\nbe a name for a new, quantitative science, the science that bears that\nname today, and was becoming increasingly inapplicable to the\ninvestigation of many traditional philosophical problems about\nchanging things (and of some newly discovered problems about changing\nthings).\n\nWhatever the reason for the change may have been, it would be flying\nin the face of current usage (and indeed of the usage of the last\nthree or four hundred years) to stipulate that the subject-matter of\nmetaphysics was to be the subject-matter of Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics. It would, moreover, fly in the face of the fact\nthat there are and have been paradigmatic metaphysicians who deny that\nthere are first causes\u2014this denial is certainly a metaphysical\nthesis in the current sense\u2014others who insist that everything\nchanges (Heraclitus and any more recent philosopher who is both a\nmaterialist and a nominalist), and others still (Parmenides and Zeno)\nwho deny that there is a special class of objects that do not change.\nIn trying to characterize metaphysics as a field, the best starting\npoint is to consider the myriad topics traditionally assigned to\nit.\n",
