    "main_text": "Preliminary Distinctions\n1. Preliminary Distinctions\n \n\nEgalitarianism is a contested concept in social and political\nthought. One might care about human equality in many ways, for many\nreasons. As currently used, the label \u201cegalitarian\u201d does not\nnecessarily indicate that the doctrine so called holds that it is\ndesirable that people's condition be made the same in any respect or\nthat people ought to be treated the same in any respect. An\negalitarian might rather be one who maintains that people ought to be\ntreated as equals\u2014as possessing equal fundamental worth and\ndignity and as equally morally considerable. In this sense, a sample\nnon-egalitarian would be one who believes that people born into a\nhigher social caste, or a favored race or ethnicity, or with an\nabove-average stock of traits deemed desirable, ought somehow to count\nfor more than others in calculations that determine what morally ought\nto be done. (On the thought that the core egalitarian ideal is\ntreating people as equals, see Dworkin 2000.) Further norms of\nequality of condition or treatment might be viewed as free-standing or\nderived from the claim of equality of status. Controversy also swirls\naround attempts to specify the class of beings to whom egalitarian\nnorms apply. Some might count all and only human beings as entitled to\nequality of status. Some would hold that all and only persons have\nequal moral status, with the criteria of personhood excluding some\nhumans from qualifying (e.g., the unborn fetus or severely demented\nadult human) and including some nonhumans (e.g., intelligent beings\ninhabiting regions of outer space beyond Earth). Some would hold that\nsentient beings such as nonhuman primates that do not satisfy criteria\nof personhood are entitled to equal moral status along with\npersons. Some advance other views.\n\n\nEgalitarianism can be instrumental or non-instrumental. Given a\nspecification of some aspect of people's condition or mode of treating\nthem that should be equal, one might hold that the state of affairs in\nwhich the stated equality obtains is morally valuable either as an end\nor as a means. The instrumental egalitarian values equality as a means\nto some independently specifiable goal; the non-instrumental\negalitarian values equality for its own sake\u2014as an end, or as\npartly constitutive of some end. For example, someone who believes that\nthe maintenance of equality across a group of people fosters relations\nof solidarity and community among them, and is desirable for that\nreason, qualifies as an instrumental egalitarian. Someone who believes\nthat equality of some sort is a component of justice, and morally\nrequired as such, would be a non-instrumental egalitarian.\n\n\nEquality of any sort might be valued conditionally or\nunconditionally. One values equality in the former way if equality is\ndeemed valuable only if some further condition is in place. One might\nhold that equality in the distribution of resources among a group of\npersons is valuable, but only on the condition that the individuals are\nequally deserving.\n\n\nEquality might be deemed to be desirable or undesirable. A separate\nand distinct range of questions concerns whether or not people ought to\nact to bring about equality or are obligated to bring about equality\n(see Nagel 1991). The discussion to come often merges these questions,\nthe assumption being that if equality is valuable, that is at least one\ngood reason for thinking one should bring it about.\n\n\nFor those who regard equality as a requirement of justice, the\nquestion arises, whether this is a timeless unchanging or instead a\nvariable requirement. Michael Walzer is one who appears to take the\nlatter view. According to Walzer, a society is just if and only if its\npractices and institutions are in accord with the shared values and\ncultural understandings of its people. Democratic egalitarianism\nbecomes a requirement of justice in modern societies, because this\negalitarianism is an underlying important element of people's\nshared values and cultural understandings (Walzer 1983). But this\nappearance may be misleading. Walzer may hold that everyone at all\ntimes and places has an equal moral entitlement to be treated according\nto the shared norms and cultural understandings of one's people\nor group. Walzer may also hold that everyone at all times and places\nhas equal rights against gratuitous assault by people just seeking fun,\nwhatever the local people's shared beliefs on this matter happen\nto be. At any rate, we can identify clear exemplars of theorists who\nregard equality of a certain sort as a timeless unchanging moral\nrequirement. John Locke holds that everyone at all times and places has\nequal natural moral rights that all of us ought always to respect\n(Locke 1690). The contemporary moral philosopher Thomas Scanlon holds\nthat all people everywhere equally have the moral right to be treated\naccording to the outcome of a procedure: what constitutes morally right\nand wrong action is set by the principles that no one could reasonably\nreject (Scanlon 1998). It is a further question, to what extent this\nprocedure issues in different non-rejectable principles in different\ntimes and places featuring different circumstances.\n\n\nEgalitarianism can be formulated with a variety of roles in mind.\nFor example, an egalitarian norm might be proposed as a fundamental\nmoral principle. As such, it would be intended as a statement of the\nultimate norm (or as a member of the set of ultimate norms) to which\nindividual conduct and institutional arrangements ought to conform. An\nultimate norm might or might not be suitable for the role of guiding\nindividual decision making or of serving as an explicitly recognized\nprinciple regulating institutions and public policy formation in a\nparticular society. If individual agents and public officials are\nliable through limited cognitive ability, limited knowledge, or limited\nallegiance to morality to misapply ultimate principles, it might well\nbe the case that these principles could be implemented to a greater\ndegree if they were not employed directly as decision-making guides for\nindividual and public policy choice. (On this issue, see Hare 1981).\nFollowing this train of thought, one might favor as guidelines for\nindividual and public choice simple, easily understood, readily\nimplementable rules that are to serve as proxies for the moral\nprinciples that are the ultimate norms. Or one might instead hold that\nthe ultimate moral principles that fix what is right and wrong are well\nsuited to be practical decision making guides. The point is merely that\nwe should distinguish these distinct roles that moral norms might play\nand avoid criticizing a norm in one role by standards appropriate only\nif the norm is understood to be playing a different role.\n\n\nEgalitarianism might be upheld as a moral requirement, a component\nof what we fundamentally owe one another, or as morally optional, a\ndesirable ideal that we might permissibly decline to pursue. When\naffirmed as morally required, egalitarianism typically figures in a\ntheory of justice. For the most part the discussion in this entry\nconcentrates on egalitarianism as a morally required component of\njustice, but in considering arguments against a version of\negalitarianism, it is worthwhile keeping in mind the possibility that\nthe norm in question is morally desirable but not morally\nmandatory.\n\n\nGiven some specification of the kind of equality that is under\nconsideration, it is clear what it means to say of a number of people\nthat they are equal in the stated respect. If we are concerned with\nequal utility, then a group has equal utility when all have exactly the\nsame. If we are concerned with equality of dollar holdings, then people\nare equal when all hold exactly the same number of dollars. But saying\nthis does not yet suggest a way of determining, in general, whether\ninequality is greater in one situation than in another, when different\npeople hold different amounts of the good that we are concerned to\nequalize in the two situations. Inequality can be measured in different\nways, and no measure seems to be strongly supported by common sense\nintuition about the meaning of equality. (See Sen 1997 and Temkin\n1993). This entry usually abstracts from this issue by supposing that\nwe can unequivocally determine, for any ideal of equality, how to\nmeasure degrees of inequality across the board.\n",
