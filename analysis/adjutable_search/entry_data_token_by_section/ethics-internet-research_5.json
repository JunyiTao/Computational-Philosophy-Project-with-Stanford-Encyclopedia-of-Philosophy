    "main_text": "Key Ethical Issues in Internet Research || Informed Consent\n4.3 Informed Consent\n\nAs the cornerstone of human subjects protections, informed consent\nmeans that participants are voluntarily participating in the research\nwith adequate knowledge of relevant risks and benefits. Providing\ninformed consent typically includes the researcher explaining the\npurpose of the research, the methods being used, the possible outcomes\nof the research, as well as associated risks or harms that the\nparticipants might face. The process involves providing the recipient\nclear and understandable explanations of these issues in a concise\nway, providing sufficient opportunity to consider them and enquire\nabout any aspect of the research prior to granting consent, and\nensuring the subject has not been coerced into participating. Gaining\nconsent in traditional research is typically done verbally or in\nwriting, either in a face-to-face meeting where the researcher reviews\nthe document, through telephone scripts, through mailed documents,\nfax, or video, and can be obtained with the assistance of an advocate\nin the case of vulnerable populations. Most importantly, informed\nconsent was built on the ideal of \u201cprocess\u201d and the\nverification of understanding, and thus, requires an ongoing\ncommunicative relationship between and among researchers and their\nparticipants. The emergence of the Internet as both a tool and a venue\nfor research has introduced challenges to this traditional approach to\ninformed consent.\n\nIn most regulatory frameworks, there are instances when informed\nconsent might be waived, or the standard processes of obtaining\ninformed consent might be modified, if approved by a research ethics\n board.[5]\n Various forms of Internet research require different approaches to\nthe consent process. Some standards have emerged, depending on venue\n(i.e., an online survey platform versus a private Facebook group).\nHowever, researchers are encouraged to consider waiver of consent\nand/or documentation, if appropriate, by using the flexibilities of\ntheir extant regulations.\n\nWhere consent is required but documentation has been waived by an\nethical review board, a \u201cportal\u201d can be used to provide\nconsent information. For example, a researcher may send an email to\nthe participant with a link a separate portal or site information page\nwhere information on the project is contained. The participant can\nread the documentation and click on an \u201cI agree\u201d\nsubmission. Rosser et al. (2010) recommend using a\n\u201cchunked\u201d consent document, whereby individuals can read\nspecific sections, agree, and then continue onwards to completion of\nthe consent form, until reaching the study site.\n\nIn addition to portals, researchers will often make use of consent\ncards or tokens; this alleviates concerns that unannounced researcher\npresence is unacceptable, or, that a researcher\u2019s presence is\nintrusive to the natural flow and movement of a given locale. Hudson\nand Bruckman (2004, 2005) highlighted the unique challenges in gaining\nconsent in chat rooms, while Lawson (2004) offers an array of consent\npossibilities for synchronous computer-mediated communication. There\nare different practical challenges in the consent process in Internet\nresearch, given the fluidity and temporal nature of Internet\nspaces.\n\nIf documentation of consent is required, some researchers have\nutilized alternatives such as electronic signatures, which can range\nfrom a simple electronic check box to acknowledge acceptance of the\nterms to more robust means of validation using encrypted digital\nsignatures, although the validity of electronic signatures vary by\njurisdiction.\n\nRegardless of venue, informed consent documents are undergoing changes\nin the information provided to research participants. While the basic\nelements of consent remain intact, researchers must now acknowledge\nwith less certainty specific aspects of their data longevity, risks to\nprivacy, confidentiality and anonymity (see\n \u00a74.1 Privacy, above),\n and access to or ownership of data. Research participants must\nunderstand that their terms of service or end user license agreement\nconsent is distinct from their consent to participate in research.\nAnd, researchers must address and inform participants/subjects about\npotential risk of data intrusion or misappropriation of data if\nsubsequently made public or available outside of the confines of the\noriginal research. Statements should be revised to reflect such\nrealities as cloud storage (see\n \u00a74.4 below)\n and data sharing.\n\nFor example, Aycock et al. (2012: 141) describe a continuum of\nsecurity and access statements used in informed consent documents:\n\n\u201cNo others will have access to the data\u201d\n\u201cAnonymous identifiers will be used during all data\ncollection and analysis and the link to the subject identifiers will\nbe stored in a secure manner\u201d\n\u201cData files that contain summaries of chart reviews and\nsurveys will only have study numbers but no data to identify the\nsubject. The key [linking] subject names and these study identifiers\nwill be kept in a locked file\u201d\n\u201cElectronic data will be stored on a password protected and\nsecure computer that will be kept in a locked office. The software\n\u2018File Vault\u2019 will be used to protect all study data loaded\nto portable laptops, flash drives or other storage media. This will\nencode all data\u2026 using Advanced Encryption Standard with\n128-bit keys (AES-128)\u201d\n\n\nThis use of encryption in the last statement may be necessary in\nresearch including sensitive data, such as medical, sexual, health,\nfinancial, and so on. Barratt and Lenton (2010), in their research on\nillicit drug use and online forum behaviors, also provide guidance\nabout use of secure transmission and encryption as part of the consent\nprocess.\n\nIn addition to informing participants about potential risks and\nemploying technological protections, NIH-funded researchers whose work\nincludes projects with identifiable, sensitive information will\nautomatically be issued a Certificate of Confidentiality:\n\n\nCoCs protect the privacy of research subjects by prohibiting\ndisclosure of identifiable, sensitive research information to anyone\nnot connected to the research except when the subject consents or in a\nfew other specific situations (NIH 2021\n [OIR]).\n\n\nHowever, these do not protect against release of data outside of the\nU.S. Given the reality of Internet research itself, which inherently\nspans borders, new models may be in order to ensure confidentiality of\ndata and protections of data. Models of informed consent for\ntraditional international research are fundamentally challenging due\nto cultural specificity and norms (Annas 2009; Boga et al. 2011;\nKrogstad et al. 2010); with Internet research, where researchers may\nbe unaware of the specific location of an individual, consent takes on\nsignificantly higher demands. While current standards of practice show\nthat consent models stem from the jurisdiction of the researcher and\nsponsoring research institution, complications arise in the face of\nage verification, age of majority/consent, reporting of adverse\neffects or complaints with the research process, and authentication of\nidentity. Various jurisdictional laws around privacy are relevant for\nthe consent process; a useful tool is Forrester\u2019s Data Privacy\nHeat Map, which relies on in-depth analyses of the data\nprivacy-related laws and cultures of countries around the world,\nhelping researchers design appropriate approaches to privacy and data\nprotection given the particular context (see\n OIR).\n\nIn addition, as more federal agencies and funding bodies across the\nglobe encourage making research data publicly-available (i.e., NSF,\nNIH, Wellcome Trust, Research Councils U.K.), the language used in\nconsent documents will change accordingly to represent this intended\nlongevity of data and opportunities for future, unanticipated use.\nGiven the ease with which Internet data can flow between and among\nInternet venues, changes in the overall accessibility of data might\noccur (early \u201cprivate\u201d newsgroup conversations were made\n\u201cpublicly searchable\u201d when Google bought DejaNews), and\nreuse and access by others is increasingly possible with shared\ndatasets. Current data sharing mandates must be considered in the\nconsent process. Alignment between a data sharing policy and an\ninformed consent document is imperative. Both should include\nprovisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality,\nsecurity, and intellectual property.\n\nThere is general agreement in the U.S. that individual consent is not\nnecessary for researchers to use publicly available data, such as\npublic Twitter feeds. Recommendations were made by The National Human\nSubjects Protection Advisory Committee (NHRPAC) in 2002 regarding\npublicly available data sets (see\n OIR).\n Data use or data restriction agreements are commonly used and set the\nparameters of use for researchers.\n\nThe U.K. Data Archive (2011\n [OIR])\n provides guidance on consent and data sharing:\n\n\nWhen research involves obtaining data from people, researchers are\nexpected to maintain high ethical standards such as those recommended\nby professional bodies, institutions and funding organisations, both\nduring research and when sharing data. Research data \u2014 even\nsensitive and confidential data \u2014 can be shared ethically and\nlegally if researchers pay attention, from the beginning of research,\nto three important aspects:\n\n\u2022 when gaining informed consent, include provision for data\nsharing\n\n\u2022 where needed, protect people\u2019s identities by anonymising\ndata\n\n\u2022 consider controlling access to data These measures should be\nconsidered jointly. The same measures form part of good research\npractice and data management, even if data sharing is not envisioned.\nData collected from and about people may hold personal, sensitive or\nconfidential information. This does not mean that all data obtained by\nresearch with participants are personal or confidential.\n\n\nData sharing made public headlines in 2016 when a Danish researcher\nreleased a data set comprised of scraped data from nearly 70,000 users\nof the OkCupid online dating site. The data set was highly\nreidentifiable and included potentially sensitive information,\nincluding usernames, age, gender, geographic location, what kind of\nrelationship (or sex) they\u2019re interested in, personality traits,\nand answers to thousands of profiling questions used by the site. The\nresearcher claimed the data were public and thus, such sharing and use\nwas unproblematic. Zimmer (2016) was among many privacy and ethics\nscholars who critiqued this stance.\n\nThe Danish researchers did not seek any form of consent or debriefing\non the collection and use of the data, nor did they have any ethics\noversight. Many researchers and ethics boards are, however, attempting\nto mitigate some of these ethical concerns by including blanket\nstatements in their consent processes, indicating such precautions for\nresearch participants. For example,\n\n\nI understand that online communications may be at greater risk for\nhacking, intrusions, and other violations. Despite these\npossibilities, I consent to participate.\n\n\nA more specific example comes from the Canadian context when\nresearchers propose to use specific online survey tools hosted in the\nUnited States; REBs commonly recommend the following type language for\nuse in informed consent documents:\n\n\nPlease note that the online survey is hosted by Company ABC which is a\nweb survey company located in the U.S.A. All responses to the survey\nwill be stored and accessed in the U.S.A. This company is subject to\nU.S. Laws, in particular, to the U.S. Patriot Act/Domestic Security\nEnhancement Act that allows authorities access to the records that\nyour responses to the questions will be stored and accessed in the\nU.S.A. The security and private policy for Company ABC can be viewed\nat\n http://\u2026/.[6]\n\n\nResearchers are also encouraged to review the Terms of Use and Terms\nof Service of the application that are being used, demonstrating its\ndetails to the REB in the application and informing participants of\nsuch details in the informed consent form or script. Researchers are\nalso encouraged to consider broader contextual factors of the data\nsource and research goals when weighing the possible violation of a\nplatform\u2019s Terms of Service (Fiesler, Beard, & Keegan\n2020).\n4.3.1 Minors and Consent\n\nInternet research poses particular challenges to age verification,\nassent and consent procedures, and appropriate methodological\napproaches with minors. Age of consent varies across countries,\nstates, communities, and locales of all sorts. For research conducted\nor supported by U.S. federal agencies bound by the Common Rule,\nchildren are\n\n\npersons who have not attained the legal age for consent [18, in the\nU.S.] to treatments or procedures involved in the research, under the\napplicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research will be\nconducted (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 46.402(a) 2009).\n\n\nGoldfarb (2008) provides an exhaustive discussion of age of majority\nacross the U.S. states, with a special focus on clinical\nresearch, noting children must be seven or older to assent to\nparticipation (see 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 46 Subpart D 2009).\n\nSpriggs (2010), from the Australian context, notes that while no\nformal guidance exists on Internet research and minors under the\nNational Statement, she advises:\n\n\nParental consent may be needed when information is potentially\nidentifiable. Identifiable information makes risks to individuals\nhigher and may mean that the safety net of parental consent is\npreferable.\nThere is also a need to consider whether seeking parental consent\nwould make things worse e.g., by putting a young person from a\ndysfunctional home at risk or result in disclosure to the researcher\nof additional identifying information about the identity and location\nof the young person. Parental consent may be \u201ccontrary to the\nbest interests\u201d of the child or young person when it offers no\nprotection or makes matters worse (2010: 30).\n\n\n\nTo assist with the consent process, age verification measures can be\nused. These can range from more technical software applications to\nless formal knowledge checks embedded in an information sheet or\nconsent document. Multiple confirmation points (asking for age, later\nasking for year of birth, etc.) are practical measures for\nresearchers. Depending on the types of data, sensitivity of data, use\nof data, researchers and boards will carefully construct the\nappropriate options for consent, including waiver of consent, waiver\nof documentation, and/or waiver of parental consent.\n4.4 Cloud Computing and Research Ethics\n\nRecent developments in cloud computing platforms have led to unique\nopportunities\u2014and ethical challenges\u2014for researchers.\nCloud computing describes the deployment of computing resources via\nthe Internet, providing on-demand, flexible, and scalable computing\nfrom remote locations. Examples include web-based email and\ncalendaring services provided by Google or Yahoo, online productivity\nplatforms like Google Docs or Microsoft Office 365, online file\nstorage and sharing platforms like Dropbox or Box.net, and large-scale\napplication development and data processing platforms such as Google\nApps, Facebook Developers Platform, and Amazon Web Services.\n\nAlongside businesses and consumers, researchers have begun utilizing\ncloud computing platforms and services to assist in various tasks,\nincluding subject recruitment, data collection and storage,\nlarge-scale data processing, as well as communication and\ncollaboration (Allan 2011\n [OIR];\n X. Chen et al. 2010\n [OIR]);\n Simmhan et al. 2008; Simmhan et al. 2009).\n\nAs reliance on cloud computing increases among researchers, so do the\nethical implications. Among the greatest concerns is ensuring data\nprivacy and security with cloud-based services. For researchers\nsharing datasets online for collaborative processing and analysis,\nsteps must be taken to ensure only authorized personnel have access to\nthe online data that might contain PII, but also that suitable\nencryption is used for data transfer and storage, and that the cloud\nservice provider maintains sufficient security to prevent breaches.\nFurther, once research data is uploaded to a third-party cloud\nprovider, attention must be paid to the terms of service for the\ncontracted provider to determine what level of access to the data, if\nany, might be allowed to advertisers, law enforcement, or other\nexternal agents.\n\nAlongside the privacy and security concerns, researchers also have an\nethical duty of data stewardship which is further complicated when\nresearch data is placed in the cloud for storage or processing. Cloud\nproviders might utilize data centers spread across the globe, meaning\nresearch data might be located outside the United States, and its\nlegal jurisdictions. Terms of service might grant cloud providers a\nlicense to access and use research data for purposes not initially\nintended or approved of by the subjects involved. Stewardship may\nrequire the prompt and complete destruction of research data, a\nmeasure complicated if a cloud provider has distributed and backed-up\nthe data across multiple locations.\n\nA more unique application of cloud computing for research involves the\ncrowdsourcing of data analysis and processing functions, that is,\nleveraging the thousands of users of various online products and\nservices to complete research related tasks remotely. Examples include\nusing a distributed network of video game players to assist in solving\nprotein folding problems (Markoff 2010), and leveraging Amazon\u2019s\nMechanical Turk crowdsourcing marketplace platform to assist with\nlarge scale data processing and coding functions that cannot be\nautomated (Conley & Tosti-Kharas 2014; J. Chen et al. 2011). Using\ncloud-based platforms can raise various critical ethical and\nmethodological issues.\n\nFirst, new concerns over data privacy and security emerge when\nresearch tasks are widely distributed across a global network of\nusers. Researchers must take great care in ensuring research data\ncontaining personal or sensitive information isn\u2019t accessible by\noutsourced labor, or that none of the users providing crowdsourced\nlabor are able to aggregate and store their own copy of the research\ndataset. Second, crowdsourcing presents ethical concerns over trust\nand validity of the research process itself. Rather than a local team\nof research assistants usually under a principal investigator\u2019s\nsupervision and control, crowdsourcing tends to be distributed beyond\nthe direct management or control of the researcher, providing less\nopportunity to ensure sufficient training for the required tasks.\nThus, researchers will need to create additional means of verifying\ndata results to confirm tasks are completed properly and\ncorrectly.\n\nTwo additional ethical concerns with crowdsourcing involve labor\nmanagement and authorship. Mechanical Turk users were not originally\nintended to be research subjects, first and foremost. However,\nresearchers using Mechanical Turks must ensure that the laborers on\nthe other end of the cloud-based relationship are not being exploited,\nthat they are legally eligible to be working for hire, and that the\nincentives provided are real, meaningful, and appropriate (Scholz\n2008; Williams 2010\n [OIR).\n\nFinally, at the end of a successful research project utilizing\ncrowdsourcing, a researcher may be confronted with the ethical\nchallenge of how to properly acknowledge the contributions made by\n(typically anonymous) laborers. Ethical research requires the fair and\naccurate description of authorship. Disciplines vary as to how to\nreport relative contributions made by collaborators and research\nassistants, and this dilemma increases when crowdsourcing is used to\nassist with the research project.\n4.5 Big Data Considerations\n\nAlgorithmic processing is a corollary of big data research, and\nnewfound ethical considerations have emerged. From \u201calgorithmic\nharms\u201d to \u201cpredictive analytics\u201d, the power of\ntoday\u2019s algorithms exceeds long-standing privacy beliefs and\nnorms. Specifically, the National Science and Technology Council\nnote:\n\n\u201cAnalytical algorithms\u201d as algorithms for prioritizing,\nclassifying, filtering, and predicting. Their use can create privacy\nissues when the information used by algorithms is inappropriate or\ninaccurate, when incorrect decisions occur, when there is no\nreasonable means of redress, when an individual\u2019s autonomy is\ndirectly related to algorithmic scoring, or when the use of predictive\nalgorithms chills desirable behavior or encourages other privacy\nharms. (NSTC 2016: 18).\n\n\nWhile the concept of big data is not new, and the term has been in\ntechnical discourses since the 1990s, public awareness and response to\nbig data research is much more recent. Following the rise of social\nmedia-based research, Buchanan (2016) has delineated the emergence of\n\u201cbig data\u201d-based research from 2012 to the present, with\nno signs of an endpoint.\n\nBig data research is challenging for research ethics boards, often\npresenting what the computer ethicist James Moor would call\n\u201cconceptual muddles\u201d: the inability to properly\nconceptualize the ethical values and dilemmas at play in a new\ntechnological context. Subject privacy, for example, is typically\nprotected within the context of research ethics through a combination\nof various tactics and practices, including engaging in data\ncollection under controlled or anonymous environments, limiting the\npersonal information gathered, scrubbing data to remove or obscure\npersonally identifiable information, and using access restrictions and\nrelated data security methods to prevent unauthorized access and use\nof the research data itself. The nature and understanding of privacy\nbecome muddled, however, in the context of big data research, and as a\nresult, ensuring it is respected and protected in this new domain\nbecomes challenging.\n\nFor example, the determination of what constitutes \u201cprivate\ninformation\u201d\u2014and thus triggering particular privacy\nconcerns\u2014becomes difficult within the context of big data\nresearch. Distinctions within the regulatory definition of\n\u201cprivate information\u201d\u2014namely, that it only applies\nto information which subjects reasonably expect is not normally\nmonitored or collected and not normally publicly\navailable\u2014become less clearly applicable when considering the\ndata environments and collection practices that typify big data\nresearch, such as the wholesale scraping of Facebook news feed content\nor public OKCupid accounts.\n\nWhen considered through the lens of the regulatory definition of\n\u201cprivate information\u201d, social media postings are often\nconsidered public, especially when users take no visible, affirmative\nsteps to restrict access. As a result, big data researchers might\nconclude subjects are not deserving of particular privacy\nconsideration. Yet, the social media platforms frequently used for big\ndata research purposes represent a complex environment of\nsocio-technical interactions, where users often fail to understand\nfully how their social activities might be regularly monitored,\nharvested, and shared with third parties, where privacy policies and\nterms of service are not fully understood and change frequently, and\nwhere the technical infrastructures and interfaces are designed to\nmake restricting information flows and protecting one\u2019s privacy\ndifficult.\n\nAs noted\n in \u00a74.1 above\n it becomes difficult to confirm a user\u2019s intention when sharing\ninformation on a social media platform, and whether users recognize\nthat providing information in a social environment also opens it up\nfor widespread harvesting and use by researchers. This uncertainty in\nthe intent and expectations of users of social media and\ninternet-based platforms\u2014often fueled by the design of the\nplatforms themselves\u2014create numerous conceptual muddles in our\nability to properly alleviate potential privacy concerns in big data\nresearch.\n\nThe conceptual gaps that exist regarding privacy and the definition of\npersonally identifiable information in the context of big data\nresearch inevitably lead to similar gaps regarding when informed\nconsent is necessary. Researchers mining Facebook profile information\nor public Twitter streams, for example, typically argue that no\nspecific consent is necessary due to the fact the information was\npublicly available. It remains unknown whether users truly understood\nthe technical conditions under which they made information visible on\nthese social media platforms or if they foresaw their data being\nharvested for research purposes, rather than just appearing onscreen\nfor fleeting glimpses by their friends and followers (Fiesler &\nProferes, 2018). In the case of the Facebook emotional contagion\nexperiment (Kramer, Guillory, & Hancock 2014), the lack of\nobtaining consent was initially rationalized through the notion that\nthe research appeared to have been carried out under Facebook\u2019s\nextensive terms of service, whose data use policy, while more than\n9,000 words long, does make passing mention to \u201cresearch\u201d.\nIt was later revealed, however, that the data use policy in effect\nwhen the experiment was conducted never mentioned\n\u201cresearch\u201d at all (Hill 2014).\n\nAdditional ethical concerns have arisen surrounding the large scale\ndata collection practices connected to machine learning and the\ndevelopment of artificial intelligence. For example, negative public\nattention have surrounded algorithms designed to infer sexual\norientation from photographs and facial recognition algorithms trained\non videos of transgender people. In both cases, ethical concerns have\nbeen raised about both the purpose of these algorithms and the fact\nthat the data that trained them (dating profile photos and YouTube\nvideos, respectively) was \u201cpublic\u201d but collected from\npotentially vulnerable populations without consent (Metcalf 2017;\nKeyes 2019). While those building AI systems cannot always control the\nconditions under which the data they utilize is collected, their\nincreased use of big datasets captured from social media or related\nsources raises a number of concerns beyond what typically is\nconsidered part of the growing focus on AI ethics: fairness,\naccountability and transparency in AI can only be fully possible when\ndata collection is achieved in a fair, ethical, and just manner (Stahl\n& Wright 2018; Kerry 2020).\n4.6 Internet Research and Industry Ethics\n\nThe Facebook emotional contagion experiment, discussed above, is just\none example in a larger trend of big data research conducted outside\nof traditional university-based research ethics oversight mechanisms.\nNearly all online companies and platforms analyze data and test\ntheories that often rely on data from individual users. Industry-based\ndata research, once limited to marketing-oriented \u201cA/B\ntesting\u201d of benign changes in interface designs or corporate\ncommunication messages, now encompasses information about how users\nbehave online, what they click and read, how they move, eat, and\nsleep, the content they consume online, and even how they move about\ntheir homes. Such research produces inferences about\nindividuals\u2019 tastes and preferences, social relations,\ncommunications, movements, and work habits. It implies pervasive\ntesting of products and services that are an integral part of intimate\ndaily life, ranging from connected home products to social networks to\nsmart cars. Except in cases where they are partnering with academic\ninstitutions, companies typically do not put internal research\nactivities through a formal ethical review process, since results are\ntypically never shared publicly and the perceived impact on users is\nminimal.\n\nThe growth of industry-based big data research, however, presents new\nrisks to individuals\u2019 privacy, on the one hand, and to\norganizations\u2019 legal compliance, reputation, and brand, on the\nother hand. When organizations process personal data outside of their\noriginal context, individuals may in some cases greatly benefit, but\nin other cases may be surprised, outraged, or even harmed. Soliciting\nconsent from affected individuals can be impractical: Organizations\nmight collect data indirectly or based on identifiers that do not\ndirectly match individuals\u2019 contact details. Moreover, by\ndefinition, some non-contextual uses\u2014including the retention of\ndata for longer than envisaged for purposes of a newly emergent\nuse\u2014may be unforeseen at the time of collection. As Crawford and\nSchultz (2014) note,\n\n\nhow does one give notice and get consent for innumerable and perhaps\neven yet-to-be-determined queries that one might run that create\n\u201cpersonal data\u201d? (2014: 108)\n\n\nWith corporations developing vast \u201cliving laboratories\u201d\nfor big data research, research ethics has become a critical component\nof the design and oversight of these activities. For example, in\nresponse to the controversy surrounding the emotional contagion\nexperiment, Facebook developed an internal ethical review process\nthat, according to its facilitators,\n\n\nleverages the company\u2019s organizational structure, creating\nmultiple training opportunities and research review checkpoints in the\nexisting organizational flow (Jackman & Kanerva 2016: 444).\n\n\nWhile such efforts are important and laudable, they remain open for\nimprovement. Hoffmann (2016), for example, has criticized Facebook for\nlaunching\n\n\nan ethics review process that innovates on process but tells us little\nabout the ethical values informing their product development.\n\n\nFurther, in their study of employees doing the work of ethics inside\nof numerous Silicon Valley companies, Metcalf and colleagues found\nconsiderable tension between trying to resolve thorny ethical dilemmas\nthat emerge within an organization\u2019s data practices and the\nbroader business model and corporate logic that dominates internal\ndecision-making (Metcalf, Moss, & boyd 2019).\n5. Research Ethics Boards Guidelines\n\nWhile many researchers and review boards across the world work without\nformal guidance, many research ethics boards have developed guidelines\nfor Internet research. While many such guidelines exist, the following\nprovides examples for researchers preparing for an REB review, or for\nboards developing their own policies.\n\nBard College (New York) Guidelines for Internet Research\nLoyola University Chicago Policy for Online Survey Research Involving Human Participants\nPenn State Guidelines for Computer- and Internet-Based Research Involving Human Participants\nU.K. Data Archive Further Resources\nUniversity of California-Berkeley Data Security and Human Research Data Risk Assessment Matrix (pdf)\nUniversity of Connecticut Guidance for Computer and Internet-Based Research Involving Human Participants\n\n\nAdditional resources are found in\n Other Internet Resources\n below.",
