    "main_text": "Preliminary Considerations || A genealogy of modern conceptions of consequence\n1.1 A genealogy of modern conceptions of consequence\n\nIn his much-discussed 1936 paper \u2018On the concept of logical\nconsequence\u2019, Tarski presents two criteria of material adequacy\nfor formal accounts of logical consequence, which jointly capture the\n\u2018common notion\u2019 of logical consequence (or so he claims).\nThey are formulated as the following condition:\n\nIf in the sentences of the class K and in the sentence\nX we replace the constant terms which are not general-logical\nterms correspondingly by arbitrary other constant terms (where we\nreplace equiform constants everywhere by equiform constants) and in\nthis way we obtain a new class of sentences K\u2032 and a\nnew sentence X, then the sentence X\u2032 must be\ntrue if only all sentences of the class K\u2032 are true.\n(Tarski 2002, \u00a72.3)\n\n\nIn more mundane terms, the two core aspects that Tarski attributes to\nthe so-called common notion of logical consequence can be formulated\nas:\n\n(TP)\nnecessary truth-preservation: it is impossible for the\nantecedent to be true while the consequent is not true;\n(ST)\nsubstitution of terms: the relation of consequence is\npreserved under any (suitable) substitution of the non-logical terms\nof the sentences in question; this is now often referred to as the\nformality criterion.\n\n\nDifferent accounts of logical consequence can be (and have been)\nformulated on the basis of (TP) and/or (ST): they can be viewed as\nboth necessary but independent components of the notion of logical\nconsequence, as Tarski seems to suggest in the passage above; they can\nalso be viewed as closely related, in particular if (TP) can be\nreduced to (ST) (i.e. satisfaction of (ST) would entail\nsatisfaction of (TP) and vice-versa) \u2014 a view that Etchemendy\n(1990) attributes to Tarski; or one may hold that the actual core of\nthe notion of (logical) consequence is (TP), and that (ST) simply\nspecifies a particular subclass of valid consequences, often referred\nto as formal consequences (Read 1994).\n\nTarski correctly identified these two features as key components of\nthe notion of logical consequence as entertained by philosophers and\nmathematicians of his time (and also today). But the question arises:\nwhy these two features and not others? In particular, through which\n(historical) processes have they come to constitute the conceptual\ncore of the notion of logical consequence? These questions are even\nmore pressing in view of the fact that both features have\nbeen challenged as correct renditions of the conceptual core of\nlogical consequence \u2014 Etchemendy (1990) challenged the\ncentrality of formality and (ST); Fields (2008) challenged the\ncentrality of necessary truth-preservation in view of the semantic\nparadoxes.\n\nTo make further progress in these debates, an important element is\narguably the historical development of the notion of (logical)\nconsequence over the centuries, so that we may come to understand\nwhere the informal notion(s) of logical consequence come(s) from.\nEngaging in an exercise of \u2018conceptual\nhistory\u2019 may allow for a better grasp of the reasons why this\nnotion (now widely endorsed) established itself as such in the first\nplace. If these are compelling reasons, then they may count as\narguments in favor of the centrality of formality and necessary\ntruth-preservation; but if they rest on disputable, contentious\nassumptions, then the analysis may provide elements for a critical\nevaluation of each of these two components as truly constitutive of\nthe concept of logical consequence.\n\nFrom this point of view, the historical developments in the Latin\nMiddle Ages, in particular from the 12th to the\n14th century, occupy a prominent position. As will be\nargued, it is in this period that concepts and ideas inherited from\nGreek Antiquity (Aristotle in particular, but also the ancient\ncommentators) were shaped and consolidated into conceptions of\nconsequence that bear a remarkable resemblance to the Tarskian\ncondition of material adequacy presented above. Thus, an analysis of\nthese historical developments is likely to contribute significantly to\nour understanding of the current notion(s) of logical consequence.\n\nBesides variations of (TP) and (ST), criteria of relevance,\ncontainment, causation and explanatoriness also appear frequently in the writings\nof medieval authors (as well as earlier authors). As Normore (2015,\n357) puts it, there seems to be\n\na pervasive ambiguity of terms like \u2018ergo\u2019 and \u2018igitur\u2019 in\nLatin, \u2018therefore\u2019 in English, and similar particles in other\nEuropean languages between a broadly truth-preserving and a broadly\ncausal/explanatory sense.\n\n\nThis ambiguity is reflected in the different core conceptions of\nconsequence throughout the history of logic: is necessary truth\npreservation sufficient, or do we require something else, namely a\ndeeper causal (and/or epistemic) connection between antecedent and\nconsequent for the consequence to hold? Indeed, in addition to\nvariations of (TP) and (ST), there is a third recurrent theme in\nmedieval discussions on consequence:\n\n(Co)\ncontainment: in a valid consequence, the conclusion is\ncontained/understood in the premises.\n\n\nDifferent interpretations of this clause run through medieval\ndiscussions on consequence, ranging from the 12th to the 15th century\nand beyond. A number of authors seem to treat the notion of containment in metaphysical and/or semantic terms, while others (in particular the British\nauthors of the second half of the 14th century) lean more heavily\ntowards what appears to be an epistemic interpretation (see section\n3.4). And just as (TP) and (ST) still very much inform how most of us\nthink about (logical) consequence, variations of the containment\ntheme, as captured in (Co), remain pervasive among contemporary\nauthors, motivating for example the development of a number of\nrelevance logics (see entry on relevance logic in this\nencyclopedia). However, notice that (Co) is also interpreted metaphysically by a number of medieval authors; this metaphysical focus is not nearly as present among contemporary philosophers and logicians (with the exception perhaps of some of the recent discussions on the concept of grounding).\n\nNaturally, as with any historical analysis, an investigation of these\ndevelopments has intrinsic historical value in and of itself,\nindependently of its possible contribution to modern debates. Indeed,\nmedieval theories of consequence are a genuine medieval contribution:\nwhile medieval authors are clearly taking ancient Greek sources and\nideas as their starting point, the emergence of theories of\nconsequence as such is a Latin medieval innovation. But as it turns out, following the thread provided by the three key notions (TP), (ST) and (Co) as formulated above provides a suitable vantage point to\ninvestigate the development of the notion of consequence in the Latin\nMiddle Ages. In other words, historical and conceptual analysis can\neasily be combined in this case.\n",
