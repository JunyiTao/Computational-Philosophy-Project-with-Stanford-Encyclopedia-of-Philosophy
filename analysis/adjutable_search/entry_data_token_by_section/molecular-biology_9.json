Molecular Biology and General Philosophy of Science\n\nIn addition to analyzing key concepts in the field, philosophers have\nemployed case studies from molecular biology to address more general\nissues in the philosophy of science, such as reduction, explanation,\nextrapolation, and experimentation. For each of these philosophical\nissues, evidence from molecular biology directs philosophical\nattention toward understanding the concept of a mechanism for\naddressing the topic.\n",
