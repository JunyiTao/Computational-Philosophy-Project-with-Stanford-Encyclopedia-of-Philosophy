    "main_text": "The ontology of concepts || Concepts as abstract objects\n1.3 Concepts as abstract objects\n\nAn alternative conception of concepts takes concepts to be abstract\nobjects of one type or another. The idea behind this view is that\nconcepts are the meanings (or \u201ccontents\u201d) of words and\nphrases as opposed to mental objects or mental states.  This type of\nview has most prominently been associated with the view that concepts\nare Fregean senses (e.g., Peacocke 1992, Zalta 2001), so it is this\nversion of the view that concepts are abstract objects that we will\nfocus on here. For proponents of this view, concepts, as meanings,\nmediate between thought and language, on the one hand, and referents,\non the other. An expression without a referent (\u201cPegasus\u201d)\nneedn\u2019t lack a meaning, since it still has a sense. Similarly,\nthe same referent can be associated with different expressions (e.g.,\n\u201cEric Blair\u201d and \u201cGeorge Orwell\u201d) because they\nconvey different senses.  Senses are more discriminating than\nreferents. Each sense has a unique perspective on its referent\u2014a\nmode of presentation which represents the referent in a particular\nway. Differences in cognitive content trace back to differences in\nmodes of presentation. It\u2019s for this reason that the thought\nthat George Orwell is Eric Blair lacks the triviality of the\nthought that George Orwell is George Orwell even though George\nOrwell and Eric Blair are the same person. Philosophers who take\nconcepts to be senses particularly emphasize this feature of\nsenses. Christopher Peacocke, for example, locates the subject matter\nof a theory of concepts as follows: \u201cConcepts C\nand D are distinct if and only if there are two complete\npropositional contents that differ at most in that one\ncontains C substituted in one or more places for\nD, and one of which is potentially informative while the\nother is not\u201d (Peacocke 1992, p. 2). In other words, C\nand D embody differing modes of presentation. (See the entry\n Frege\n for discussion of the sense/reference distinction and for more on the\nexplanatory functions associated with senses. To avoid terminological\nconfusion, we should note that Frege himself did not use the term\n\"concept\" for senses, but rather for the referents of predicates.\nSimilarly, it is worth noting that Frege uses the term \"thought\" to\nstand for propositions, so for Frege thoughts are not psychological\nstates at all but rather the meanings of psychological states.)\n\nThe view that concepts are Fregean senses, like the abilities view, is\ngenerally held by philosophers who are opposed to identifying concepts\nwith mental representations. Peacocke himself doesn\u2019t go so far\nas to argue that mental representations are explanatorily idle, but he\ndoes think that mental representations are too fine-grained for\nphilosophical purposes. \u201cIt is possible for one and the same\nconcept to receive different mental representations in different\nindividuals\u201d (Peacocke 1992, p. 3). He is also concerned that\nidentifying concepts with mental representations rules out the\npossibility of there being concepts that human beings have never\nentertained, or couldn\u2019t ever entertain.\n\nIf we accept that a thinker\u2019s possession of a concept must be\nrealized by some subpersonal state involving a mental representation,\nwhy not say simply that the concept is the mental representation? Just\nthis proposal is made by Margolis and Laurence (1999, 77). Mental\nrepresentations that are concepts could even be typed by the\ncorresponding possession condition of the sort I favour. This seems to\nme an entirely legitimate notion of a kind of mental representation;\nbut it is not quite the notion of a concept. It can, for instance, be\ntrue that there are concepts human beings may never acquire, because\nof their intellectual limitations, or because the sun will expand to\neradicate human life before humans reach a stage at which they can\nacquire these concepts. \u2018There are concepts that will never be\nacquired\u2019 cannot mean or imply \u2018There are mental\nrepresentations which are not mental representations in anyone\u2019s\nmind\u2019. If concepts are individuated by their possession\nconditions, on the other hand, there is no problem about the existence\nof concepts that will never be acquired. They are simply concepts\nwhose possession conditions will never be satisfied by any thinkers.\n(Peacocke, 2005, p. 169).\n\n\nAdvocates of the mental representation view would respond to these\narguments by invoking the type/token distinction with respect to\nmental representations. Just as two speakers can each produce distinct\ninstances (that is, tokens)of the same type of word (e.g., the word\n\u201cchair\u201d), different thinkers\u2019 minds can produce\ndistinct instances (that is, tokens) of the same type of mental\nrepresentation (e.g., the mental representation CHAIR). How does this\nhelp with the present objection? According to the mental\nrepresentation view, to say that there are concepts that haven\u2019t\nbeen acquired by anyone is just to say that, for some types of mental\nrepresentations, there has not yet been a token in anyone\u2019s\nmind; to say that some concepts will never be acquired by anyone is\njust to say that, for some types of mental representations, there\nnever will be a token in anyone\u2019s mind (Margolis & Laurence\n2007).\n\nCritics of the sense-based view have questioned the utility of\nappealing to such abstract objects (Quine 1960). One difficulty stems\nfrom the fact that senses, as abstract entities, stand outside of the\ncausal realm. The question then is how we can access these objects.\nAdvocates of the Fregean sense view describe our access to senses by\nmeans of the metaphor of \u201cgrasping\u201d\u2014we are said to\ngrasp the sense of an expression. But grasping here is just a metaphor\nfor a cognitive relation that needs to be explicated. Moreover, though\nsenses are hypothesized as providing different modes of presentation\nfor referents, it is not clear why senses themselves do not generate\nthe mode of presentation problem (Fodor 1998). Since they are external\nto our minds, just as referents typically are, it isn\u2019t clear\nwhy we can\u2019t stand in different epistemic relations towards them\njust as we can to referents. In the same way that we can have\ndifferent modes of presentation for a number (the only even prime, the\nsum of one and one, Tim\u2019s favorite number, etc.), we ought to be\nable to have different modes of presentation for a given sense.\n",
