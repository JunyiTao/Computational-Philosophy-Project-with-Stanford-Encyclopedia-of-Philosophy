The\nsentential constants T and t whose sequent calculus\ntreatment we saw in Section\n 3\n are treated in axiomatic developments of R by means of the\naxiom schemas \u03c6 \u2192 T for the former cases and both\nt and t \u2192 (\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6), though these\nlast two can be replaced by \u03c6 \u2194 (t \u2192 \u03c6).\nHere \u2194 itself can be regarded as an abbreviation either of (\u03c6\n\u2192 \u03c8) \u2227 (\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6), or as (\u03c6\n\u2192 \u03c8) \u25cb (\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6),\nwhere \u2227 and \u25cb are the additive or \u2018extensional\u2019\n(as the relevance tradition would have it) conjunction and the\nmultiplicative or \u2018intensional\u2019 conjunction (also called\nfusion) respectively. While in linear logic neither\np \u25cb q nor p \u2227 q provably\nimplies the other, in R, thanks to the presence of contraction,\nthe latter implies the\n former.[46]\n A well-known further side effect of contraction is that \u03c6 \u25cb\n\u03c8 and \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 are also equivalent whenever \u03c6 is an\nimplicational formula and \u03c8 is its converse, so the two\nalternative readings of \u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8 above are equivalent in\nR. Now consider the possible existence of a new nullary\nconnective for R in the \u2018truth constants\u2019 family,\nT, subject to the axiom schema:\n\n\u03c6 \u2194 (T \u2194 \u03c6).\n\n\nThis looks harmless enough, the principles governing t,\nT and T all holding for the\nundifferentiated \u22a4 constant of classical and intuitionistic\nlogic, but here notationally distinguished so as not to prejudice\nquestions of the logical relations between\n them.[47]\n\nBut in R, this harmless appearance is deceptive. For in this\nlogic the connective \u2194 is what we have called special.\nAfter the well-known extension, R-Mingle or RM, of\nR by the Mingle schema \u03c6 \u2192 (\u03c6\n\u2192\n \u03c6),[48]\n let us call a formula \u03c6 for which this is already provable in\nR a Mingler. Since RM is a proper extension of\nR, not all formulas are Minglers in R. But again thanks\nto contraction, all \u2194-formulas are Minglers, rendering \u2194\nspecial in R. Now we can see that the addition of T,\nsubject to the schema inset above, would\nextend R non-conservatively because now every formula \u03c6\nwould be equivalent to the corresponding \u2194-formula T\n\u2194 \u03c6, so even for T-free\n\u03c6 we should have the Mingle theorem\n\u03c6 \u2192 (\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6). Thus no devotee of R should\nbe prepared to countenance the existence of T\nbehaving as envisaged (or indeed any pair\n#1, #2 of 1-ary connectives with \u03c6 provably\nequivalent to #1\u03c6 \u2194 #2\u03c6).\n\nThe fact that the biconditional connective is special in R may\nappear to conflict with the fact, established in Blok and Pigozzi\n(1989) that this logic is what the authors call\nalgebraizable. This term is applied to consequence relations\n\u22a2 which are translationally equivalent to the quasi-equational\nconsequence relation \u22a8K of a class of algebras\nof the same similarity type as the language of \u22a2. That is, for\nequations\ne1,\u2026,en, we\nhave\ne1,\u2026,en\u22121\u22a8K\nen just in case for any algebra A\n\u2208 K and any assignment of elements of A to the\nvariables in the ei, if all of\ne1,\u2026,en\u22121\ncome out true in A on that assignment, so does\nen. The translational equivalence idea\nmeans that there is a translation \u03c4 from formulas of the\n(sentential) language of \u22a2 to equations of the language of\nK, and a translation \u03c4\u2032 back in the other direction,\nwhich are mutually inverse in the sense that \u03c6 \u22a3\u22a2\n\u03c4\u2032(\u03c4(\u03c6)) and e\n\u2ae4\u22a8K \u03c4(\u03c4\u2032(e)) for\nall formulas \u03c6 and equations e, and, for all formulas\n\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n and equations\ne1,\u2026,en,\neither of the following conditions is satisfied (from which it follows\nthat both are):\n\n\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n\u22121 \u22a2\n\u03c6n if and only if\n\u03c4(\u03c61),\u2026,\u03c4(\u03c6n\u22121)\n\u22a8K \u03c4(\u03c6n)\n\n\nand\n\ne1,\u2026,en\u22121\n\u22a8K en if and only\nif\n\u03c4\u2032(e1),\u2026,\u03c4\u2032(en\u22121)\n\u22a2 \u03c4\u2032(en).\n\n\nThis account of algebraizability has been oversimplified for\nexpository purposes in one respect: Blok and Pigozzi (1989) do not\nrequire the translation of a formula (what we are calling \u03c4)\nshould yield a single equation, but allow a set of equations,\nand similarly in the converse direction, \u03c4\u2032(e) is\nallowed to be a set of formulas. It follows from the present\ndefinition, with the single equation/single formula restriction\nremoved, that the formulas in the latter set function collectively as\nan equivalence-like compound satisfying some further congruence\nconditions, which in the case of \u22a2R can be\ntaken to be \u2194. Accordingly, the fact that\n\u22a2R\u2014explained presently\u2014is\nalgebraizable, entails, in view of the \u201c\u03c6 \u22a3\u22a2\n\u03c4\u2032(\u03c4(\u03c6))\u201d condition, that, loosely speaking,\nevery formula is equivalent to an equivalence. But does this not clash\nwith our finding that \u2194 is special in R?\n\nWell, first, the consequence relation \u22a2R needs\nto be explained. Blok and Pigozzi have in mind the least consequence\nrelation for which \u03c6, \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 \u22a2\n\u03c8 and \u03c6, \u03c8\u22a2 \u03c6 \u2227\n\u03c8 and \u22a2\u00a0\u03c6 for all \u03c6 provable in the\nFmla logic R. (This third condition can\nbe restricted to all axioms of any axiomatization of R with\nformula-to-formula rules corresponding to the first and second\nconditions.) Now the loose summary just given to the effect that every\nformula is equivalent to an equivalence makes a misleading double use\nof the equivalence vocabulary for two different things: equivalence as\nmutual consequence (\u201c\u22a3\u22a2\u201d) and equivalence as\nthe biconditional connective. Removing the conflation, it means that\nfor every \u03c6 there exist \u03c8, \u03c7, with \u03c6\n\u22a3\u22a2R\u03c8 \u2194\n \u03c7.[49]\n This is a very different matter from having\n\u22a2R\u03c6 \u2194(\u03c8 \u2194 \u03c7). The latter\nwould indeed be equivalent to the provability in the sequent calculus\ndescribed for R in Section\n 3\n of \u03c6 \u227b \u03c8 \u2194 \u03c7 and the converse sequent. But the\napparently matching \u22a2R-statements mean\nsomething very different, building in the structural features (such as\nweakening) that the substructural sequent calculus was designed to\navoid. Note in particular that \u22a2R is not\n\u2192-introductive, in the sense of Example 2 above.\n",
