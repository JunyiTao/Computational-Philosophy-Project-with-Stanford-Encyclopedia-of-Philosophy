According\nto Fricker, people in a position of marginalization are prevented from\ncreating concepts, terms and other representational resources that\ncould be used in order to conceptualize and understand their own\nexperiences, especially those having to do with being in that position\nof marginalization. People in a position of power will tend to create\nconcepts and linguistic representations that help to conceptualize the\nexperiences and phenomena that matter to them, rather than\nthe experiences and phenomena that matter the most to people in a\nposition of marginalization. Because of this, members of marginalized\ngroups might suffer from a lacuna in the representational resources\nthat are available to them, and in particular might lack the concepts\nand terms that would allow them to understand and communicate their\nexperiences. In order to illustrate this phenomenon, Fricker (2007)\nfocuses on several examples, such as the articulation of the term\n\u2018sexual harassment\u2019: before the term was coined, victims\nof sexual harassment lacked the language to explain their experiences\nof receiving unwanted sexual advances at work in a way that would make\nclear why those interactions wronged them.\n\nIn the growing literature on hermeneutical injustice, philosophers\nhave mainly focused on the following two central questions: first, how\nto properly understand the phenomenon of hermeneutical injustice\n(namely, what is distinctively epistemic about it, and what\nmakes it unjust); and secondly, how to resist this kind of\ninjustice and how to fill in the corresponding conceptual and\nlinguistic gaps in our collective understanding of situations of\nmarginalization.\n\nRegarding the first question, Laura Beeby (2011) has argued that the\nrelevant notion of hermeneutical injustice is one that focuses on the\nepistemic situation of lacking the relevant concepts and terms, rather\nthan on one\u2019s position within the background social conditions\nthat give rise to it. She argues that, for example, in the case of\nsexual harassment both the victim and the harasser suffer from\nhermeneutical injustice since they both have similar epistemic\nsituations, that is, they both have similar gaps in their collective\nunderstanding of what is going on. As Beeby argues, if we offer a\ncharacterization of hermeneutical injustice in terms of the\nepistemic situation of the subject, and in particular in\nterms of their conceptual gaps, then both the harasser and that\nharassee will be in a situation of hermeneutical injustice, but this\nseems to be in tension with Fricker\u2019s claim that only the victim\nsuffers from hermeneutical injustice. However, as Beeby also\nemphasizes, one could respond, following Fricker, that people in a\nposition of power are epistemically advantaged in another sense,\nnamely, they do have the ability to create concepts and terms that are\nuseful in order to understand and communicate their own experiences\nand the social interactions that matter the most to them. This\ncontrasts with the situation of the marginalized, who lack this\nability.\n\nHowever, the idea that the marginalized lack the ability to\nconceptualize and communicate their own experiences has also been\ncontested by philosophers such as Rebecca Mason (2011), Kristie Dotson\n(2012), Gaile Pohlhaus (2012) and Jos\u00e9 Medina (2013). For\nexample, Mason (2011) and Medina (2013) have both argued that although\nFricker is right that people in a situation of marginalization might\nnot have access to publicly shared terms in order to communicate their\nexperiences to those in a position of power, they might nonetheless be\nable to make sense of their own experiences in a useful way, even\nbefore those public concepts are introduced in the dominant language.\nFor example, in the case of sexual harassment, some victims of sexual\nharassment were able to attend women\u2019s consciousness-raising\nmeetings and talk to each other about their similar experiences, that\nis to say, they were able to understand their experiences and\ncommunicate them to people in the same predicament, even before they\nhad a term like \u2018sexual harassment\u2019. Therefore, Mason\n(2011) argues, it seems plausible to say that members of marginalized\ngroups already have some conceptual resources that enable them to\nunderstand their own social experiences, and what they actually lack\nis the power to introduce these meanings into the collective\nunderstanding, which is unjust, and which results in the fact that\ndominant groups have a distorted understanding of the social\nexperiences of non-dominant groups. Relatedly, Pohlhaus (2012) has\nargued that marginalized subjects are in a better position to notice\ngaps in our collective epistemic resources in order to properly\ndescribe and conceptualize the experiences of those who are socially\noppressed. Moreover, these subjects could work cooperatively with\nother subjects in the same predicament so as to develop new epistemic\nresources that can deal with those spheres of the social world that\npeople in a position of domination do not usually pay attention to.\nHowever, as Pohlhaus argues, it will be difficult to convince the\nprivileged to employ those new epistemic resources developed by the\nmarginalized. She calls this phenomenon of dismissive ignorance\nwillful hermeneutical ignorance.\n\nFurthermore, Dotson (2012)\nhas introduced a new kind of epistemic injustice, in addition to\ntestimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice, namely, what she\ncalls contributory injustice. This kind of epistemic\ninjustice has to do not only with the phenomenon of willfully ignoring\nthe epistemic resources developed by the marginalized, but also with\nthe continuous use of distorted epistemic resources developed by those\nin a position of power, without paying attention to the experiences of\nthe marginalized. This use of faulty conceptual resources acts to\nblock the uptake of the new conceptual resources developed by the\nmarginalized, which leads to further misunderstandings. In addition,\nMedina (2013) has argued that the fact that members of non-dominant\ngroups have the ability to understand their own experiences and\ncommunicate them to each other is a prior and necessary step in order\nto bring new, more sophisticated concepts and terms into our shared\nlanguage. According to Medina, this can also help with our second\nquestion above, namely, how to resist hermeneutical injustice: he\nsuggests that members of dominant groups should be more sensitive to\ninchoate attempts at communication by people in a position of\nsubordination, even before they have access to shared concepts to\nproperly conceptualize those aspects of our social interactions. Finally, Derek E. Anderson (2017) distinguishes a new kind of epistemic injustice, namely, conceptual competence injustice, which occurs when a marginalized subject is not considered to be a competent user of a concept, because of a lack of linguistic or conceptual credibility, when in fact they are perfectly competent. This is different from hermeneutical injustice, Anderson argues, since in cases of hermeneutical injustice marginalized subjects lack access to some important concepts due to structural reasons, whereas in cases of conceptual competence injustice they fully possess the concepts but are regarded as incompetent speakers. However, this kind of injustice is closely related to Dotson\u2019s notion of contributory injustice, since in cases where privileged subjects use distorted or biased hermeneutical resources, they will be more likely to doubt the conceptual competence of marginalized subjects (even if these are in fact more fully competent), which amounts to conceptual competence injustice, and hence the conceptual resources of the marginalized will in turn be less likely to get uptake, which amounts to contributory injustice.\n\nFinally, regarding the question of what kinds of conceptual resources might be\nneeded in order to fill in the hermeneutical gaps in our collective\nunderstandings, Komarine Romdenh-Romluc (2016) argues that what is\nneeded are new terms and concepts that have the correct\nevaluative component, in addition to the right descriptive\ncomponent. For instance, introducing the term \u2018sexual\nharassment\u2019 was very useful because the new term somehow implies\nthat sexual harassment is wrong, whereas previous terms such as\n\u2018harmless flirting\u2019 did not connote the appropriate\nnegative evaluative component. Likewise, as Medina (2013) argues, the\nappropriation of terms such as \u2018gay\u2019 and\n\u2018queer\u2019 by the LGBT community can be seen as a strategy\nfor overcoming a situation of hermeneutical injustice, since these\nterms came to express new, positive conceptions of same-sex desire, in\ncontrast to old conceptions of it as something pathological or\nperverse. In addition, George Hull (forthcoming) argues that\nconsciousness-raising is very important, not only as a means to\novercoming hermeneutical injustice, but it \u201ccan itself\nconstitute the overcoming of hermeneutical injustice\u201d (2016:\n13). He focuses on the case of black South Africans during apartheid,\nand he argues, drawing on the work of Black Consciousness theorists\nsuch as B.S. Biko and N.B. Pityana, that they were liable to\nexperience a mismatch between their experiences of racism and\noppression, and the collective hermeneutical resources available to\nthem. Because of this, consciousness-raising can help to correct false\nor distorted conceptions and images of themselves, and to develop new\nconceptual tools in order to make sense of those aspects of their\nlives. Furthermore, Charlie Crerar (2016) has argued that the\ninjustice associated with lack of hermeneutical resources does not\noccur only in cases of conceptual absence (i.e. conceptual lacunas) or\nconceptual inadequacy (i.e. lack of concepts with the appropriate\nconnotations), but also in cases where there is a rich conceptual\nrepertoire but taboos or other social practices prevent marginalized\nsubjects from discussing some matters of interest to them. Therefore,\nhe argues, \u201cwe require access to an expressively free\nenvironment in which to put these concepts to work: an open and\nreceptive social context in which a particular experience that\nindividuals or groups have a significant interest in coming to\nunderstand can be discussed in hermeneutically conducive ways\u201d\n(2016: 205).\n",
