    "main_text": "Diderot\u2019s Life and Major Writings || Years of Formation and Struggle (1713\u20131749)\n1.1 Years of Formation and Struggle (1713\u20131749)\n\nBorn to an artisan cutler in 1713 in Langres, a city 300 kilometers\nsoutheast of Paris, Diderot began his life with very little pointing\nhim toward his future as a world-renowned writer and intellectual. His\nfirst steps were supported by a university education under the\nsupervision of the Jesuits and training in scholastic philosophy and\ntheology through the M.A. level.\n\nHaving moved to Paris as a teenager to pursue his studies, Diderot\nbegan to forge his career as a piece writer in the vibrant but\neconomically constrained world of Parisian publishing.\nD\u2019Alembert would later romanticize the life of the poor but\nfully independent writer as an ideal to which all honn\u00eates\ngens de lettres should aspire, and Diderot actually lived the\nimpoverished bohemian writer\u2019s life in the flesh. During the\n1730s, he struggled continuously to eke out a minimal existence\nthrough occasional work with his pen, especially finding work as a\ntranslator, and his financial hardship was increased after his\nmarriage in 1743 to an equally poor woman and the arrival of a\ndaughter soon thereafter.\n\nIn the 1740s, poor and still marginal, Diderot began to build the\ncareer as a writer and intellectual that would make him famous. In\n1742, he met the young Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a key moment in the\ngenesis of the philosophe movement, which Rousseau\nimmortalized for posterity in his Confessions. Etienne Bonnot\nde Condillac also joined their circle at this time. Diderot further\nbegan to write and publish his own books in this period, establishing\nhis name and reputation as a philosophical author, one who was\nperennially associated with the most radical and controversial\nideas.\n\nKey works from this period include a very loose translation of\nShaftesbury\u2019s An Inquiry Concerning Virtue and Merit,\nin which Diderot turns moral sense theory into a kind of aesthetics of\nNature; Pens\u00e9es philosophiques, a work of provocative\nphilosophical propositions concerning matter, motion, nature and\nscience; La Promenade du sceptique, a philosophical dialogue\nwhich was written in this period but only published a century later;\nand Les Bijoux indiscrets, which is best described as\nphilosophical pornography.\n\nThe climax of Diderot\u2019s prolific decade occurred in 1749 with\nthe publication of Lettre sur les aveugles \u00e0 l\u2019usage\nde ceux qui voient, one of Diderot\u2019s masterpieces and\narguably his most sophisticated and complex philosophical text after\nLe R\u00eave de D\u2019Alembert and Le Neveu de\nRameau. The Lettre, which presents itself as a series of\nreflections on the blind mathematician Nicholas Saunderson, is perhaps\nbest described by Diderot biographer Arthur N. Wilson as\n\u201cdisarming\u201d (1972: 97).\n\nDiderot\u2019s public intellectual acclaim increased with each of\nthese books, and by the time of the Lettre sur les aveugles\nhe had become famous enough for Voltaire himself, already the public\nface of radical philosophie, to write to Diderot praising his\nbooks. But the same acclaim that attracted Voltaire\u2019s attention\nalso rendered Diderot suspicious in the eyes of the French\nauthorities. A police file with Diderot\u2019s name on it was opened\nsoon after the Pens\u00e9es philosophiques appeared, and\nthis work was ordered to be publicly burned in July 1746. By 1749, the\nevidence pointing to Diderot\u2019s authorship of these subversive\n(potentially or explicitly atheistic) works was conclusive, and after\nthe publication of the Lettre sur les aveugles an order was\nissued ordering Diderot\u2019s incarceration in Vincennes prison. He\nwas imprisoned for three months starting in July 1749, before being\nreleased the following November.\n",
