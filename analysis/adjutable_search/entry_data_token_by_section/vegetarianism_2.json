    "main_text": "Meat Production || Animal Farming\n2.1 Animal Farming\n\nRaising large numbers of animals enables farmers to take advantage of\neconomies of scale but also produces huge quantities of waste,\ngreenhouse gas, and, generally, environmental degradation (FAO 2006;\nHamerschlag 2011; Budolfson 2016). There is no question of whether to\nput so many animals on pasture\u2014there is not enough of it. Plus,\nraising animals indoors, or with limited access to the outdoors,\nlowers costs and provides animals with protection from weather and\npredators. Yet when large numbers of animals live indoors, they are\ninvariably tightly packed, and raising them close together risks the\ndevelopment and quick spread of disease. To deal with this risk,\nfarmers intensively use prophylactic antibiotics. Tight-packing also\nrestricts species-typical behaviors, such as rooting (pigs) or\ndust-bathing (chickens), and makes it so that animals cannot escape\neach other, leading to stress and to antisocial behaviors like\ntail-biting in pigs or pecking in chickens. To deal with these,\nfarmers typically dock tails and trim beaks, and typically (in the\nU.S., at least) do so without anesthetic. Animals are bred to grow\nfast on a restricted amount of antibiotics, food, and hormones, and\nthe speed of growth saves farmers money, but this breeding causes\nhealth problems of its own. Chickens, for example, have been bred in\nsuch a way that their bodies become heavier than their bones can\nsupport. As a result, they \u201care in chronic pain for the last 20%\nof their lives\u201d (John Webster, quoted in Erlichman 1991).\nAnimals are killed young\u2014they taste better that way\u2014and\nare killed in large-scale slaughterhouses operating at speed. Animal\nfarms have no use for, e.g., male chicks on egg-laying farms, are\nkilled at birth or soon\n after.[2]\n\nRaising animals in this way has produced low sticker prices (BLS\n2017). It enables us to feed our appetite for meat (OECD 2017).\n\nRaising animals in this way is also, in various ways, morally\nfraught.\n\nIt raises concerns about its effects on humans. Slaughterhouses,\nprocessing this huge number of animals at high speed, threaten injury\nand death to workers. Slaughterhouse work is exploitative. Its\ndistribution is classist, racist, and sexist with certain jobs being\nsegmented as paupers\u2019 work or Latinx work or women\u2019s\n(Pachirat 2011).\n\nIndustrial meat production poses a threat to public health through the\ncreation and spread of pathogens resulting from the overcrowding of\nanimals with weakened immune systems and the routine use of\nantibiotics and attendant creation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\nAnomaly (2015) and Rossi & Garner (2014) argue that these risks\nare wrongful because unconsented to and because they are not justified\nby the benefits of assuming those risks.\n\nIndustrial meat production directly produces waste in the form of\ngreenhouse gas emissions from animals and staggering amounts of waste,\nwaste that, concentrated in those quantities, can contaminate water\nsupplies. The B\u00f6ll Foundation (2014) estimates that farm animals\ncontribute between 6 and 32% of greenhouse gas emissions. The range is\ndue partly to different ideas about what to count as being farm\nanimals\u2019 contributions: simply what comes out of their bodies?\nOr should we count, too, what comes from deforestation that\u2019s\ndone to grow crops to feed them and other indirect emissions?\n\nIndustrial animal farming raises two concerns about wastefulness. One\nis that it uses too many resources and produces too much waste for the\namount of food it produces. The other is that feeding humans meat\ntypically requires producing crops, feeding them to animals, and then\neating the animals. So it typically requires more resources and makes\nfor more emissions than simply growing and feeding ourselves crops\n(PNAS 2013.\n\nIndustrial animal farming raises concerns about the treatment of\nanimals. Among others, we raise cattle, chickens, and pigs. Evidence\nfrom their behavior, their brains, and their evolutionary origins,\nadduced in Allen 2004, Andrews 2016, and Tye 2016, supports the view\nthat they have mental lives and, importantly, are sentient creatures\nwith likes and dislikes. Even chickens and other\n\u201cbirdbrains\u201d have interesting mental lives. The exhaustive\nMarino 2017 collects evidence that chickens can adopt others\u2019\nvisual perspectives, communicate deceptively, engage in arithmetic and\nsimple logical reasoning, and keep track of pecking orders and short\nincrements of time. Their personalities vary with respect to boldness,\nself-control, and vigilance.\n\nWe farm billions of these animals industrially each year (B\u00f6ll\nFoundation 2014: 15). We also raise a much smaller number on freerange\nfarms. In this entry \u201cfreerange\u201d is not used in its\ntightly-defined, misleading, legal sense according to which it applies\nonly to poultry and simply requires \u201caccess\u201d to the\noutdoors. Instead, in the entry, freerange farms are farms that that,\nideally, let animals live natural lives while offering some protection\nfrom predators and the elements and some healthcare. These lives are\nin various ways more pleasant than lives on industrial farms but\ninvolve less protection while still involving control and early death.\nThese farms are designed, in part, to make animal lives go better for\nthem, and their design assumes that a natural life is better, other\nthings equal, than a non-natural life. The animal welfare literature\nconverges on this and also on other components of animal well-being.\nSummarizing some of that literature, David Fraser writes,\n\n\n[A]s people formulated and debated various proposals about what\nconstitutes a satisfactory life for animals in human care, three main\nconcerns emerged: (1) that animals should feel well by being spared\nnegative affect (pain, fear, hunger etc.) as much as possible, and by\nexperiencing positive affect in the form of contentment and normal\npleasures; (2) that animals should be able to lead reasonably natural\nlives by being able to perform important types of normal behavior and\nby having some natural elements in their environment such as fresh air\nand the ability to socialize with other animals in normal ways; and\n(3) that animals should function well in the sense of good health,\nnormal growth and development, and normal functioning of the body.\n(Fraser 2008: 70\u201371)\n\n\nIn this light, it is clear why industrial farming seems to do less for\nanimal welfare than freerange farming: The latter enables keeping\nanimals healthy. It enables happy states (\u201cpositive\naffect\u201d) and puts up some safeguards against the infliction of\nsuffering. There is no need, for example, to dock freerange\npigs\u2019 tails or to debeak freerange chickens, if they have enough\nspace to stay out of each other\u2019s way. It enables animals to\nsocialize and to otherwise lead reasonably natural lives. A\nfreerange\u2019s pig\u2019s life is in those ways better than an\nindustrially-farmed pig\u2019s.\n\nYet because freerange farming involves being outdoors, it involves\nvarious risks: predator- and weather-related risks, for example. These\ngo into the well-being calculus, too.\n\nAnimals in the wild are subjected to greater predator- and\nweather-related risks and have no health care. Yet they score very\nhighly with regard to expressing natural behavior and are under no\none\u2019s control. How well they do with regard to positive and\nnegative affect and normal growth varies from case to case. Some meat\nis produced by hunting such animals. In practice, hunting involves\nmaking animals suffer from the pain of errant shots or the terror of\nbeing chased or wounded, but, ideally, it involves neither pain nor\nconfinement. Of course, either way, it involves\n death.[3]\n",
