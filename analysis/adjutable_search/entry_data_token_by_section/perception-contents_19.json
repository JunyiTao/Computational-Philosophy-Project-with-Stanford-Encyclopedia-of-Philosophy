    "main_text": "Content and Phenomenology || Representationalism about Phenomenology\n7.1 Representationalism about Phenomenology\n\nRepresentationalism (or intentionalism) is the\nthesis that phenomenal properties are determined by representational\nproperties. The thesis is sometimes stated as the supervenience claim\nthat phenomenal properties supervene on the representational\nproperties of an experience, so that any two experiences that have the\nsame representational properties have the same phenomenology.\n\nRepresentationalism comes in many versions. One way in which versions\ndiffer is that they may be claims about all sensory experience, or\njust some kinds of sensory experience. (Tye 1995 defends a version of\nrepresentationalism about all sensory experience; most discussions to\ndate have focused on visual experience, as does Pautz 2010.)\n\nA challenge to across-the-board representationalism comes from\nexperiences in modalities where it is unclear whether the experiences\nrepresent happenings in the space outside the body, such as gustation,\nolfaction, and experiences of afterimages. However, the notion of\naccuracy conditions that defines the notion of content we\u2019ve\nbeen working with leaves it open whether those conditions pertain to\nthe world outside the mind or not. Consider whether olfactory\nexperiences represent anything about the smells or sources of smells\noutside the body (for discussion see Smith (2002), chapter 5, Batty\n2010, 2011, Richardson 2013). There is a coherent view on which an\nolfactory experience can have accuracy conditions, even if they are of\nthe form \u2018an odor like so is present to me\u2019. To take\nanother example, consider afterimages. According to Loar (2003),\nexperiences of afterimages represent \u2018luminous happenings in\nstrange spaces\u2019, which suggests that an experience of an\nafterimage could include a content roughly like \u2018there is a\nreddish luminous occurrence over there\u2019, where\n\u2018there\u2019 indicates a position in the \u2018strange\nspace\u2019. (Perhaps the experience is neutral about whether the\nspace is inside or outside the mind). The notion of accuracy\nconditions also leaves it open whether there could be accuracy\nconditions that were met whenever a subject had an experience with\nthose conditions. For instance, suppose that sense can be made of the\nnotion of \u2018mental space\u2019 or \u2018subjective\nspace\u2019, and that some experiences have accuracy conditions\nconcerning smells, tastes or afterimages that reside in such space.\nGiven these suppositions, one might think that whenever an experience\nrepresents that something occurs in such spaces, the experience is\naccurate. In opposition to this idea, Bengson (2013) argues that the\nvisual experiences of pink glow or seeing blackness, and the auditory\nexperience of ringing in the ears fail to attribute color, luminance,\nor auditory properties to anything at all, and so resist analysis in\nterms of accuracy conditions. \n\nAnother potential problem for across-the-board representationalism\nconcerns experiences in different sense-modalities. As stated,\nrepresentationalism requires that any two experiences with the same\ncontent have the same phenomenology, even if the experiences occur in\ndifferent sensory modalities. Seeing something square and touching\nsomething square are phenomenally different. If representationalism is\ntrue for both haptic-tactile and visual experiences, then these\nexperiences cannot have the same content. Normally two such\nexperiences would probably not have exactly the same content anyway,\nfor instance if the visual experience represented properties (e.g.,\ncolors) that the tactile experience didn\u2019t. But abstracting away\nfrom those differences, there is a strong intuition that the visual\nphenomenology correlated with visually representing squareness differs\nfrom the tactile phenomenology correlated with feeling something to be\nsquare. It seems that across-the-board representationalism must either\n(i) deny the intuition that the visual phenomenology correlated with\nvisually representing squareness differs from the tactile\nphenomenology correlated with feeling something to be square, or else\n(ii) deny that the contents related to representations of squareness\nreally are the same after all, so that each modality (or natural\ngrouping of modalities) has a special kind of content to call its own,\nand one cannot experience by one modality exactly the same thing as\none can experience by another. Response (ii) is illustrated by one\nanswer to Molyneux\u2019s question (see entry on\n Molyneux\u2019s problem)\n whether someone born blind and was familiar with the feel of a cube\ncould recognize a cube upon seeing it for the time, without also\ntouching it. If the answer to Molyneux\u2019s question is that the\npreviously blind person could not visually recognize cubes, one might\nconjecture that this is because the shape properties represented by\nvisual experience on the one hand and by haptic tactile experience on\nthe other differ.\n\nAnother response to this potential problem revises the thesis of\nrepresentationalism, construing the representational properties that\ndetermine phenomenology as attitude-content complexes rather than\ncontents alone. For example, Chalmers 2004 distinguishes pure\nrepresentational properties\u2014the property of having a\ncertain content\u2014from impure representational\nproperties\u2014the property of having a certain content\nrepresented in a certain way. Examples of impure representational\nproperties include the property of having a certain content\nrepresented in modality M, and that of having attitude\nA to a certain content. Impure representationalism\nis then the thesis that impure representational properties determine\nphenomenology, so that any two experiences with the same impure\nrepresentational properties have the same phenomenology. This position\nallows that experiences in different modalities, or experiences that\ninstantiate different attitudes, could have the same content, yet\ndiffer phenomenally because, say, one is visual and the other\nkinesthetic. For instance, perhaps both represent that one\u2019s\nhand is moving, or that something is round. Versions of impure\nrepresentationalism are held by Lycan 1996, Chalmers 2004, 2006, Pautz\n2010.\n",
