    "main_text": "\n\n\nWhile sport has been practised since pre-historic times, it is a\nrelatively new subject of systematic philosophical enquiry. Indeed,\nthe philosophy of sport as an academic sub-field dates back only to\nthe 1970s. Yet, in this short time, it has grown into a vibrant area\nof philosophical research that promises both to deepen our\nunderstanding of sport and to inform sports practice. Recent\ncontroversies at the elite and professional level have highlighted the\nethical dimensions of sport in particular. Lance Armstrong\u2019s use\nof performance-enhancing drugs raised new issues in the ethics of\ncheating, middle-distance runner Caster Semenya has challenged\nprevailing rules around sex classification in sport, and Oscar\nPistorius\u2019s prosthesis has problematized the distinction between\nable-bodied and disabled sport.  While philosophical analysis may help\nto achieve a deeper understanding of sport, such analysis may also\nilluminate problems of philosophy beyond sport, ranging from the\nnature of skill to the ethics of altruism.\n\nThis entry proceeds in three sections. Section 1 introduces the\nphilosophy of sport with particular emphasis on the history of\nsystematic philosophical thinking about sport. Section 2 examines the\nnature and value of sport, and it considers the main normative theories\nof sport developed in the literature. Section 3 addresses a cluster of\ntopics that are central to the philosophy of sport, including:\nsportsmanship; cheating; performance enhancement; violent and dangerous\nsport; sex, gender, and race; fans and spectators; disability\nsport; and the aesthetics of sport.\n",
