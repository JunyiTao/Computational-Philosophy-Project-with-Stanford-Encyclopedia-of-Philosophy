    "main_text": "Preserving Divine Transcendence While Avoiding Negative Theology || Proposal One: Sameness of Predicate No Guarantee of Sameness of Property\n4.1 Proposal One: Sameness of Predicate No Guarantee of Sameness of Property\n\nGraham Oppy (2003) suggests a way to defeat the foregoing argument.\nOppy (in effect) rejects the inference from (2) and (3) to (4). Given\nthe truth of \u2018God is powerful\u2019 and \u2018Socrates is\npowerful,\u2019 it does not follow that there is a property expressed\nby the predicate \u2018powerful\u2019 that is shared by God and\nSocrates. On Oppy\u2019s approach, both sentences are true, and the\npredicate \u2018powerful\u2019 has the same sense in both sentences.\nThere is no equivocation and no analogy either. It is just that there\nis no one property that is expressed by the predicate in its two\noccurrences. If this right, then there is no warrant for (4) and the\nabove argument against DDS collapses.\n\nOppy is not denying that many predicates express properties; he is\ndenying that all do. Taking a page from David Armstrong (1978), he is\nsaying that predicates and their senses provide no sure guidance as to\nwhat properties (Armstrongian immanent universals) the world contains.\nIt follows that the ontological structure of the truth-maker of a true\nsentence cannot be read off from the syntactic structure of the\nsentence of which it is the truth-maker. Therefore, the fact that our\ntwo sentences (3) and (4) have the form a is F does not\nwarrant the conclusion that the respective truth-makers have the\nstructure: particular-exemplifying-same universal. Oppy writes:\n\nThat two sentences of the form \u2018a is red\u2019 and\n\u2018b is red\u2019 are both true does not entail that\nthere is some universal that plays a role in making both of these\nsentences true; it is possible that none of the universals that play a\nrole in making true the sentence \u2018a is red\u2019 have\nany role in making true the sentence \u2018b is red.\u2019\n(This point is supported by those lines of thought which suggest that,\nfrom a scientific standpoint, \u2018redness\u2019 constitutes a\nhighly gerrymandered and heterogeneous \u2018kind.\u2019) (Oppy\n2003, p. 15)\n\n\nThe idea is essentially this. Suppose that something is an H\nif and only if it is either an F or a G. One can\neasily see that if a is H and b is\nH, it does not follow that there is some one property that\nthey share. For it might be that a is H in virtue of\na\u2019s exemplifying F-ness and b is\nH in virtue of b\u2019s exemplifying\nG-ness. Applied to Socrates and the simple God: Socrates is\npowerful in virtue of exemplifying P1 while God is\npowerful in virtue of exemplifying P2. Thus there\nis no one property, the property of being powerful, that both\nexemplify. So (4) above is false, and the argument against DDS\ncollapses. Since a full defense of Oppy\u2019s defense of DDS is\nbeyond the scope of the present entry, we shall focus on a second way\nof defusing the objection.\n",
