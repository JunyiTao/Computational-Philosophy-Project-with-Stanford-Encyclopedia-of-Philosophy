    "main_text": "Religious/theological language\n6. Religious/theological language\n\nTheological language has a special status that presents a challenge\nfor thinkers particularly within the Abrahamic traditions since God is\nconsidered to be completely different from creation, while our\nlanguage applies mainly, if not solely, to creatures. Thus, to express\nwhat and how God is proves a difficult challenge. The follow section\nconsiders earlier Islamic approaches to understanding theological\nlanguage and how to read the Qur\u2019an\u2019s claims about God.\nThe next section\n (\u00a76.2)\n considers how later Muslim philosophers and the various schools of\nMuslim theologians developed these approaches with an eye to their\ndiscussions of the divine attributes.\n",
