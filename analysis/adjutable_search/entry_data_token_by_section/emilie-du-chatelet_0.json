Du Ch\u00e2telet's Magnum Opus on Natural Philosophy: The Foundations of Physics: Introduction to the text\n\n\nIt is likely that Du Ch\u00e2telet's interest in writing a\ntext on Newtonian physics began to form around 1736 when Voltaire was\nworking through his own ideas for a text on Newton, eventually\npublished in 1738 (El\u00e9ments de la philosophie de\nNewton). Du Ch\u00e2telet's distinct advantage over\nVoltaire on this project was her superior mathematical training, given\nthat she sought out and benefitted from the tutelage of several of\nEurope's leading mathematicians. One such engagement was to have\nsignificant impact on both her own text on natural philosophy and on\nthe fate of her reputation as an original and innovative thinker. This was her\nengagement with Samuel Koenig, who arrived at Cirey in 1739 to tutor Du\nCh\u00e2telet in mathematics shortly after Du Ch\u00e2telet\nbenefitted from similar tutelage under Maupertuis (Zinsser 2006,\n162).\n\n\nThe significant\u2014and positive\u2014impact upon her text on\nnatural philosophy followed from the fact that Koenig brought with him\nto France, and to Du Ch\u00e2telet, the Leibnizian-inspired ideas of\nChristian Wolff. This may have contributed to a critical change in Du\nCh\u00e2telet's project, for Newtonian physics alone no longer seemed\nto her to be the correct way of explaining various features of the\nnatural world. Still, it is quite possible that Koenig's influence on\nDu Ch\u00e2telet has been over-estimated, for when Du\nCh\u00e2telet's earliest version of the Institutions de\nphysique (hereafter Foundations) was approved by the\ncensor Pitot\u2014before Du Ch\u00e2telet's tutoring sessions with\nKoenig\u2014Pitot mentioned that the text already contained ideas\nfrom\n Leibniz.[1]\n Nonetheless, in her later, published version of the\nFoundations, it is possible that she came to see more\nforcefully the need for metaphysical foundations for the phenomena\nthat Newton so powerfully describes in mathematical terms (e.g. Janik\n1982, 93 and 102). And so, in 1738, Du Ch\u00e2telet withdrew her\nFoundations from imminent publication in order to massively\nredraft it. The final product, published in 1740, would include an\nIntroduction followed by ten chapters on topics of metaphysics\ntouching on issues such as the principles of knowledge (chapter 1),\nGod (2), space and time (5 and 6) and four chapters on matter and\nbodies (7 through 10). Only then does the text deal with physics of an\nessentially Newtonian character.\n\n\nThe significant\u2014and negative\u2014impact upon her reputation as\nan original and innovative thinker followed from Koenig's accusation,\nupon the publication of Du Ch\u00e2telet's Foundations, that\nshe had plagiarized his ideas within the text, though given the point\nmade above, that Leibnizian ideas were already present in the text she\nwrote before Koenig's arrival, his charge seems\nmisplaced. Nonetheless, this stain upon the originality and power of\nDu Ch\u00e2telet's intellect remained in some form or another until\nthe mid-twentieth century when William Barber concluded that her\nthought was \u201cessentially derivative\u201d of a number of her\nmale contemporaries, particularly Voltaire (Barber 1967). Others have\nargued for the originality of her views, and (Barber aside), this\ninterpretation has been the dominant one since Ira O. Wade presented\nhis careful case for her intellectual independence\u2014again,\nparticularly from Voltaire (Wade 1947). In what follows, more evidence\nis provided in favor of the growing belief that Du Ch\u00e2telet is\nnot a mere parrot of her more famous male contemporaries' views.\n\n\nOne way of characterizing Du Ch\u00e2telet's\nFoundations is to show that it is a reaction against Cartesian\nnatural philosophy and in favor of Newtonian physics. In the main, this\nis correct. Indeed, by the time Du Ch\u00e2telet turned her attention\nto the project of the Foundations, the popularity of Cartesian\nnatural philosophy was on the wane in France, the popularity of\nNewtonain physics was on the rise, and Du Ch\u00e2telet was in the\nthick of these movements. Still, two facts should give us pause when\nmaking the general claim just articulated. The first is that Cartesian\nnatural philosophy and Newtonian physics have\ndifferent scopes, with the former presenting a unified system of\nmetaphysics grounding and constraining the physics that follows from\nthe metaphysics. Indeed, Du Ch\u00e2telet's commitment to\ndeveloping a natural philosophy (rather than writing simply about\nphysics) required that she find an appropriate metaphysics to ground\nNewtonain physics, thus presenting a unified system to replace the (in\nher and others' view) defunct system of Descartes.\n\n\nThe second fact that ought to give us pause is that Du\nCh\u00e2telet was remarkably even handed and open minded about her\nreaction to various thinkers. She seems to have been swayed neither by\nnational prejudice nor by the authority of whatever great men were most\nfavored in France in her time. She prescribed being guided by truth in\none's philosophical decisions about what to adopt and what to\nreject from the various metaphysicians and physicists whose work was\nanimating intellectual circles in her time (IP Avant-Propos\nVII, X and XI). She herself was remarkably in line with this principled\napproach. So while it is true that, in the main, she rejects Cartesian\nnatural philosophy, she is still appreciative of Descartes'\nadvances in, for example, geometry, dioptrics and method (IP\nAvant-Propos V, p.\n 118).[2]\n\n\nOne interesting element of what could be characterized as her\nadmiration of Descartes' method is that the Foundations\nfairly closely tracks the structure of Descartes' project in his\nPrinciples of Philosophy. Both texts start with indubitable\nprinciples of knowledge, which, in the first instance, lead to\nconclusions about the metaphysics of God. These conclusions allow one\nto gain knowledge of the metaphysical structure of the world, which in\nturn grounds physical laws that allow the observer to make scientific\nsense of the world (Lascano 2011, 742\u20133; c.f. Zinsser 2006,\n173). This underscores at least that the two thinkers had a shared\ninterest in developing a unified natural philosophy with a well-worked\nout, and fairly robust, metaphysics detailed first. Another highly\nplausible reading of Du Ch\u00e2telet's mimicking of Descartes'\nmature work is that she sees herself offering a new natural philosophy\nto replace the largely rejected Cartesian system, just as Descartes\nbefore her aimed to replace the old Scholastic natural philosophy with\nhis Principles of Philosophy. This interpretation is born out\nby a comparison of the two texts, for there are important divergences\nbetween them, not just on the details in the metaphysics, but also on\nthe range of topics addressed. For Descartes' forays into what we\nwould now call \u201cscience\u201d included not only astronomy and\nphysics, but planned sections on living bodies and on the human being,\nincluding its soul, thus promising to touch on topics such as human\nhealth and morals (in keeping with his metaphor of the tree of\nphilosophy offered in the preface to the Principles). In\ncontrast, Du Ch\u00e2telet's text deals exclusively with physics,\nleaving the broader array of natural philosophical topics and moral\nphilosophy left untouched. Still, the overall similarity in structure\nbetween the two texts indicates her affinity, at least with respect to\nher overall project, with Descartes. Here, we examine a few crucial\nmoments in her Foundations, underscoring how she and\nDescartes compare and contrast on these points, with an eye to showing\nsome central aspects of her own brand of natural philosophy, and some\nof the ways in which Du Ch\u00e2telet fit (and did not fit) into the\nFrench Enlightenment (especially with regard to Newtonianism and\nscientific methodology).\n",
