    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nIn the influential The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\n(1962), Kuhn made the dramatic claim that history of science reveals\nproponents of competing paradigms failing to make complete contact\nwith each other\u2019s views, so that they are always talking at\nleast slightly at cross-purposes. Kuhn characterized the collective\nreasons for these limits to communication as the incommensurability of\npre- and post-revolutionary scientific traditions, claiming that the\nNewtonian paradigm is incommensurable with its Cartesian and\nAristotelian predecessors in the history of physics, just as\nLavoisier\u2019s paradigm is incommensurable with that of\nPriestley\u2019s in chemistry (Kuhn 1962, 147\u2013150; cf.\nCaama\u00f1o 2009 and Hoyningen-Huene 2008). These competing\nparadigms lack a common measure because they use different concepts\nand methods to address different problems, limiting communication\nacross the revolutionary divide. Kuhn initially used\nincommensurability predominately to challenge cumulative\ncharacterizations of scientific advance, according to which scientific\nprogress is an improving approximation to the truth, and to challenge\nthe idea that there are unchanging, neutral methodological standards\nfor comparing theories throughout the development of the natural\nsciences. Like in evolution, the process does not change\ntoward some fixed goal according to some fixed rules, methods\nor standards, but rather it changes away from the pressures\nexerted by anomalies on the reigning theory (Kuhn 1962,\n170\u2013173). The process of scientific change is eliminative and\npermissive rather than instructive. In the process of confronting\nanomalies, certain alternatives are excluded, but nature does not\nguide us to some uniquely correct theory.\n\nKuhn developed and refined his initial idea over the following\ndecades, repeatedly emphasizing that incommensurability neither means\nnor implies incomparability; nor does it make science irrational (e.g.\nKuhn 2000 [1970], 155ff.). He focused increasingly on conceptual\nincompatibility as manifest in the structural differences used to\nclassify the kinds whose relations are stated in laws and theories,\nsuch as chemical elements and biological species (Kuhn 2000, see\nespecially chs. 3, 4, 5, 10 & 11). He used incommensurability to\nattack the idea, prominent among logical positivists and logical\nempiricists, that comparing theories requires translating their\nconsequences into a neutral observation language (cf. Hoyningen-Huene\n1993, 213\u2013214). In the late 1990s, he explicated\nincommensurability in terms of ineffability, emphasizing that\nit became possible for scientists to make and understand certain new\nstatements only after a particular theory had been introduced\n(in the older vocabulary the new sentences are nonsensical), just as\nit only becomes possible for historians to understand certain older\nstatements by setting aside current conceptions that otherwise cause\ndistortions (Kuhn 2000 [1989], 58\u201359; 2000 [1993], 244). Such\n\u2018taxonomic incommensurability\u2019 results in\ntranslation failure between local subsets of inter-defined terms due\nto the cross-classification of objects into mutually exclusive\ntaxonomies. This can be distinguished from \u2018methodological\nincommensurability\u2019, according to which there is no common\nmeasure between successive scientific theories, in the sense that\ntheory comparison is sometimes a matter of weighing historically\ndeveloping values, not following fixed, definitive rules (Sankey and\nHoyningen-Huene 2001, vii-xv). This makes room for rational\ndisagreement in theory comparison, as scientists may apply different\nvalues (such as scope, simplicity, fruitfulness, accuracy) in\nevaluating and comparing particular theories, so that theory choice is\nnot unequivocally determined throughout the scientific community.\n\nPaul Feyerabend first used the term incommensurable in 1962 in\n\u201cExplanation, Reduction and Empiricism\u201d to describe the\nlack of logical relations between the concepts of fundamental theories\nin his critique of logical empiricists models of explanation and\nreduction. He argued that in the course of scientific advance, when\nfundamental theories change, meanings change, which can result in a\nnew conception of the nature of reality. By calling two fundamental\ntheories incommensurable, Feyerabend meant that they were conceptually\nincompatible: The main concepts of one could neither be defined on the\nbasis of the primitive descriptive terms of the other, nor related to\nthem via a correct empirical statement (Feyerabend 1962, 74, 90). For\nexample, Feyerabend claimed that the concepts of temperature and\nentropy in kinetic theory are incommensurable with those of\nphenomenological thermodynamics (1962, 78); whereas the Newtonian\nconcepts of mass, length and time are incommensurable with those of\nrelativistic mechanics (1962, 80). Feyerabend repeatedly used the idea\nof incommensurability to challenge a wide range of forms of conceptual\nconservativism, arguing that they unjustifiably favor successful,\nentrenched concepts over potential improvements, and overlook the\npossibility of developing incommensurable alternatives (Oberheim 2005,\n2006).\n\nThe entry is organized around the 1962 popularisations of the concept\nof incommensurability by Kuhn and Feyerabend and the basic ideas that\ninfluenced their developments of this concept. First, Kuhn\u2019s\nnotion of incommensurability as it was initially developed is\ncharacterized, as is its cause and its purported consequences. That is\nfollowed by an examination of Kuhn\u2019s route to the idea, and then\nhis subsequent development after 1962. The sections on\nFeyerabend\u2019s notion of incommensurability mirror the same basic\nstructure. They are followed by a brief comparison of Kuhn and\nFeyerabend\u2019s views on incommensurability, especially its\nrelation to theory comparison.\n",
