    "main_text": "The Role of Interpretation in Legal Reasoning: || Some Points of Disagreement\n2.4 Some Points of Disagreement\n\n\nLegal theorists disagree about the proper characterisation of many\naspects of the schematic account of the interpretive process given in\nsubsections 2.2 and 2.3 above. A few of these disagreements will be\nsurveyed here in order to give a fuller picture of some of the issues\nand views which are relevant to this topic. Accounts of the role of\ninterpretation in legal reasoning, then, differ regarding the following\nmatters (n.b. several of the following points overlap to some extent): \n\n(1) What exactly is the original or object which is\nbeing interpreted in the case of law: the law as a whole?; certain\naspects of legal practice?; statutes?; judicial decisions?;\nauthoritative legal decisions?; legal texts? Raz 1996b claims that the\nprimary objects of interpretation are the decisions of legal\nauthorities. He reaches this conclusion as a result of his view that\nlaw is an institutionalised normative system wherein the institutions\nconcerned operate by issuing purportedly authoritative directives\nconcerning what ought to be done. According to Raz, then, the central\nrole which authority plays in law means that when we come to interpret\nthe law, what we are primarily seeking to do is to establish the\nexistence and meaning of any purportedly authoritative directives of\nlegal institutions, and it is, therefore, the decisions of those\ninstitutions which constitute the originals to be interpreted in the\ncase of law. (See further the discussion of Raz's views in subsection\n2.5 below). This stance can be contrasted with that adopted by Ronald\nDworkin. The process of \u2018constructive interpretation\u2019\n(Dworkin 1986, and see also the entry\n interpretivist theories of law)\n which\nplays such a central role in Dworkin's jurisprudential thought involves\ninterpreters, \u2018imposing purpose on an object or practice in order\nto make of it the best possible example of the form or genre to which\nit is taken to belong.\u2019 (Dworkin 1986, p52). Moreover, in the\ncase of legal interpretation, Dworkin appears to settle for the\nargumentative social practice of law as the original to be interpreted\n(Dworkin 1986, p63). This being so, for Dworkin, the object of legal\ninterpretation appears to be broader than that adopted by Raz. For Raz,\nwe interpret in order to establish whether any authoritative legal\ndirectives are currently in force and bear upon the legal issue at\nhand, and so we should look to the decisions establishing those\ndirectives in getting the interpretive process off the ground.\nDworkinian interpretation, however, seems to have a more abstract and\nglobal feel to it, in the sense that it is the social practice of law\nas a whole (Dworkin 1986, 87\u201388), including the entire legal history of\na given jurisdiction, as well as any data speaking to the point or\npurpose of legal practice in general, which constitutes the original to\nbe interpreted.\n\n(2) How much emphasis is to be placed on the\nconserving vs. the creative elements in interpretation? At the\nconserving extreme, we find accounts such as \u2018originalism\u2019\nin US constitutional interpretation which claims that in interpreting\na particular provision of the Constitution, judges should seek to\nestablish the way in which the provision was originally understood by\nthose who ratified it (see e.g. Bork 1990). As close as possible\nconformity with those original intentions thus furnishes us with the\nstandard of correctness in constitutional interpretation on this\napproach. According to Bork 1990, adherence to originalism in US\nconstitutional interpretation is necessary to ensure that the\njudiciary confines itself to its proper sphere of authority, thus\npreserving the separation of powers and structure of government in the\nform in which the founders of the US intended. Ronald Dworkin has\nrecently addressed directly the topic of originalism in US\nConstitutional Interpretation and has argued that fidelity to the\nConstitution's text does not exhaust constitutional interpretation,\nand that the search for constitutional integrity (see further point 6\nbelow, and the section on Coherence in Legal Reasoning) might require\ninterpreters to depart from the best interpretation of the\nconstitutional text considered apart from the history of its\nenforcement (Dworkin 2006, ch.5). Accounts such as that offered by\nLevinson (1982) are at the other end of the spectrum: they reject\noriginalism and give far more weight to the role of innovation in\nlegal interpretation. Indeed, Levinson contends that all US\nconstitutional interpretation is necessarily creative, due to radical\nand pervasive linguistic indeterminacy in the law. If such approaches\nwish to claim that there are standards by which we can judge\ninterpretations to be better or worse, correct or incorrect, then they\nmust find such standards other than in the conserving aspect of\ninterpretation, as the requirement that one be faithful to the meaning\nof an original seems to be obliterated on such views. As was noted at\nthe end of subsection 2.2 above, some such views may wish to claim\nthat our practice of accounting interpretations as good or bad,\ncorrect or incorrect is incoherent. One other possibility, however, is\nthat the notion of \u2018correctness\u2019 can be salvaged by being\npegged to the communal reactions of the relevant interpretive\ncommunity; our interpretations are the right ones when they accord\nsufficiently with those of our similarly situated fellow interpreters\n(see e.g. Kripke 1982 and those works discussed in\npoint (3) below).  Some commentators have poured\nscorn on the idea that this sort of approach could yield standards of\ncorrectness worthy of the name. See for example Baker & Hacker\n1984, who contend that Kripke's position amounts to the view that,\n\u2018an unjustified stab in the dark is unobjectionable as long as\nit is made in good company.\u2019 (Baker and Hacker 1982, 81\u201382).\n\n(3) Following on from point (2)\nabove: how big a role does the requirement that judges must be faithful\nto an original play in constraining legal interpretation, and are there\nany additional constraints which supplement the constraints generated\nby the need to be faithful to an original which guide judges as they\ninterpret the law? For example, for Owen Fiss (1982),\n\u2018disciplining rules\u2019 in the form of those standards which\nare constitutive of the profession of judging supply constraints upon\njudicial interpretation which supplement the rules of language which\nalready constrain all language users in their attempts to understand\ntexts. According to Fiss, then, judges are constrained both by the need\nto be faithful to the original legal text which they are interpreting,\nand by supplementary norms of interpretation which are constitutive of\nthe judicial role (Fiss lists the requirement that judges must always\nconsult history when interpreting the law as an example of a\n\u2018disciplining rule\u2019). Fiss' view is criticised by Stanley\nFish (1989), who contends that Fiss' \u2018disciplining rules\u2019\nwould themselves require interpretation in order for judges to know\nwhat they mean and require of them, and hence cannot supply constraints\nupon judicial interpretation. Fish's contention that all potential\ncandidates which might constrain interpretation are themselves\nsusceptible to being interpreted in a variety of ways results in his\nclaiming that texts or originals cannot constrain judges at all in the\nway in which is commonly supposed, as texts do not have meanings in\nadvance of particular interpretations of them. This seemingly radical\nindeterminacy is deceptive, however, for although Fish removes the\nconstraints on interpretation provided by legal texts or supplementary\nnorms of the judicial profession, he replaces them with the\nconditioning and training processes of \u2018interpretive\ncommunities\u2019, which ensure that, \u2018\u2026readers are already\nand always thinking within the norms, standards, criteria of evidence,\npurposes and goals of a shared enterprise\u2019, such that, \u2018the\nmeanings available to them have been preselected by their professional\ntraining.\u2019 (Fish 1989, 133).\n\n(4) Whether or not it is possible to have a general\ntheory of interpretation. Raz 1996a rejects the possibility of\ntwo types of general theories of interpretation:\n\u2018operational\u2019 or recipe-like theories which are designed to\nguide judges to the right decision in a case which comes before them,\nand theories which, although they may not aim to guide judges to the\ncorrect decision, nonetheless claim to provide us with criteria via\nwhich to distinguish good interpretations from bad, and so enable us to\ncheck the correctness of decisions which have been made. According to\nRaz, theories of the former kind are impossible because morality (to\nwhich recourse must be had as regards the innovative aspect of legal\ninterpretation) is not susceptible to explanation via\n\u2018operational\u2019 theories, i.e., \u2018theories which would\nenable a person whose moral understanding and judgement are suspect to\ncome to the right moral conclusions regarding situations he may face by\nconsulting the theory.\u2019 (Raz 1996a, p21. In this he follows\nsimilar claims made by several contemporary moral philosophers, e.g.\nWilliams 1985; Dancy 1993). Moreover, claims Raz, theories which\npurport to tell us how to differentiate good interpretations from bad\nare also impossible because, by its very nature, innovation defies\ngeneralisation, such that it is futile to attempt to construct a\ngeneral theory which differentiates good interpretations from bad as\nregards the forward-looking aspect of interpretation. It should be\nnoted that (as is apparent from the discussions in this entry as a\nwhole), Raz does believe that it is possible to have an account which\nexplains certain aspects of the nature and role of interpretation in\nlegal reasoning; what he doubts is that it is possible to have a\ncertain kind of account of interpretation, namely an account in the\nform of a theory which purports either to operate as a recipe for\nconcocting good interpretations, or to provide us with a general\naccount of how to evaluate interpretations as good or bad, right or\nwrong (on this point see also Raz 2009 essay 12 section IX).\n\n\nRonald Dworkin, by contrast, does purport to offer judges a general\ntheory of legal interpretation which they can use to guide their\ninterpretive activities, and which, if followed correctly, will lead\nthem to the \u2018one right answer\u2019 in the case before them (on\nDworkin's \u2018one right answer\u2019 thesis, see further point\n(7) below). For Dworkin, it is the aim of all legal\ninterpretation to \u2018constructively interpret\u2019 the social\npractice of law, by imposing purpose upon it such as, \u2018to make\nof it the best possible example of the form or genre to which it is\ntaken to belong.\u2019 (Dworkin 1986, p52). The more specific theory\nwhich he believes that judges should follow in fulfilling this\ntask\u2014\u2018law as integrity\u2019\u2014\u2018instructs\njudges to identify legal rights and duties, so far as possible, on the\nassumption that they were created by a single author\u2014the\ncommunity personified\u2019 (see subsections 2.5 and 3.4, and the\nentry\n interpretivist theories of law).\n It\nshould be noted, however, that while Dworkin's general theory of\ninterpretation is designed to assist in guiding judges to the one right\nanswer in a case which comes before them, he claims that it is not\nrecipe-like in the sense of providing judges with a detailed step by\nstep programme for correct judicial decision-making: \u2018I have not\ndevised an algorithm for the courtroom. No electronic magician could\ndesign from my arguments a computer program that would supply a verdict\neveryone would accept once the facts of the case and the text of all\npast statutes and judicial decisions were put at the computer's\ndisposal\u2019 (Dworkin 1986, p. 412).\n\n\nDworkin's pro-theory stance has attracted criticism from a variety\nof quarters. Fish (1989, essays 4, 5 and 16) claims that \u2018law as\nintegrity\u2019 is not a theory which judges can use to guide their\ninterpretive activities because it is a strategy which they cannot help\nbut put into practice, and to which they are always and already\ncommitted simply in virtue of their membership in the judicial\ninterpretive community. Sunstein 1996 also warns against the kind of\n\u2018high-level theories\u2019 which Dworkin instructs judges to\nconstruct and follow in deciding cases. Sunstein is suspicious of the\nvalue of such theorising on the grounds that, \u2018it takes too much\ntime and may be unnecessary; because it may go wrong insofar as it\noperates without close reference to actual cases; because it often\nprevents people from getting along at all; and because general\ntheorizing can seem or be disrespectful insofar as it forces people to\ncontend, unnecessarily, over their deepest and most defining moral\ncommitments.\u2019 (Sunstein 1996, p50). Instead, Sunstein advocates a\nspecial role for \u2018incompletely theorized agreements\u2019 in\njudicial decision-making. Such agreements can occur where judges agree\non the outcomes of individual cases even though they disagree on which\ngeneral theory best accounts for those outcomes, or agree on a general\nprinciple, but not on what that principle requires in particular cases,\nor agree on a \u2018mid-level\u2019 principle (see Sunstein 1996,\np36) but disagree about both the general theory underlying it and\nparticular cases falling under it. Sunstein regards incompletely\ntheorised agreements as vital to legal reasoning, because they allow\nthe diverse individuals who constitute the judiciary to agree on\noutcomes against the background of certain institutional constraints\nsuch as that they have, \u2018a weak democratic pedigree and limited\nfact-finding capacity\u2019 (Sunstein 1996, p6), must make many\ndecisions, make them fairly quickly, show adequate respect, to\nlitigants, and to each other, and avoid error insofar as is possible.\nSunstein presents a strong case for the role of incompletely theorised\nagreements in law in general, pointing out that the institution of such\nagreements is one of the most important social functions of legal\nrules, as rules are capable of allowing agreement in the face of\ndisagreement, in the sense that sometimes judges can agree on outcomes\nto cases governed by a rule whilst disagreeing about the rule's\njustification (on this important function of legal rules see also Raz\n2001).\n\n(5) Whether or not interpretation is always of\nsomething which to some extent already has meaning, or whether\ninterpretation is the fundamental determinant of the meaning\nof linguistic expressions in, for example, legal texts. Marmor 1992,\n2005 & Stone 1995 deny that interpretation is the fundamental\ndeterminant of the meaning of linguistic expressions and contend that,\nfollowing a certain reading of Wittgenstein's remarks on\nrule-following (namely the kind of reading offered by McDowell 1984\nand Baker and Hacker 1985), it must be possible for us to grasp the\nmeaning of, for example, a legal rule, in a way which does not require\nrecourse to interpretation. Cornell 1992 & Fish 1989 deny this,\nand contend that interpretation is all-pervasive, and is the\nfundamental and inescapable determinant of meaning, \u2018all the way\ndown\u2019, in all cases. In the minds of some legal theorists at\nleast, this point has strong links with with the issue of linguistic\nindeterminacy in law mentioned in subsection 2.1 above (see e.g. Fish\n1989; Cornell 1992).  Those theorists who contend that interpretation\nis the fundamental determinant of the meaning of linguistic\nexpressions often claim that such interpretation is necessary because\nlegal rules expressed in language do not have determinate meanings and\nhence cannot determine their own correct application; in John\nMcDowell's terminology, those rules, by themselves, cannot have\n\u2018normative reach.\u2019 (McDowell 1984 & 1992). This being\nthe case, so this line of thinking goes, interpretation is required in\norder to bridge the gap between the inert legal rule and the\nsituations to which it applies.  For these theorists, the pertinent\nissue then becomes: how do we know that one interpretation rather than\nanother is in accordance with the rule, if the rule itself cannot\ndetermine its own correct application?  As Wittgenstein notes in his\nremarks on rule-following, it seems that: \u2018 \u2018Whatever I do\nis, on some interpretation, in accord with the rule\u2019\u2019,\nsuch that we can, \u2018\u2026give one interpretation after another; as\nif each one contented us at least for a moment, until we thought of\nyet another standing behind it.\u2019 (Wittgenstein 1967, \u00a7198\nand \u00a7201 respectively). Some theorists, e.g. Fish 1989, seem to\nembrace this potential infinite regress of alternative interpretations\nof rules (see also point (3) above) and attempt to\navoid the radical linguistic indeterminacy which it seems to entail by\nreplacing the standards of correctness demarcated by rules with the\nconditioning and training processes of interpretive communities. For\ntheorists like Marmor (1992 & 2005) and Stone (1995) who deny that\ninterpretation is the fundamental determinant of the meaning of\nlinguistic expressions, the Wittgensteinian challenge is seen as a\nkind of reductio ad absurdum which indicates that we have\ngone astray in our understanding of how rules operate. Such theorists\nseek to avoid linguistic indeterminacy, and reject interpretation as\nthe fundamental determinant of meaning by denying that there is a gap\nwhich needs to be bridged between grasping a rule and understanding\nthose actions which it requires. As was noted above, this denial\nusually proceeds via a non-sceptical reading of Wittgenstein's remarks\non rule-following, along the lines of that offered by McDowell 1984\nand Baker and Hacker 1985.\n\n(6) Which values judges should attempt to realise\nin legal interpretation, and how those values are to be balanced\nagainst one another. One debate on this issue is that between Dworkin\n(1986), who champions the role of the value of integrity in\ninterpreting the law, and those who, like Raz (1994a), and\nR\u00e9aume (1989), doubt whether Dworkinian integrity is a\nvalue which should be pursued in legal interpretation. The value of\ncoherence in legal reasoning is addressed further in Section 3 of this\nentry.\n\n(7) Whether interpretation in legal reasoning can\nlead judges to the \u2018one right answer\u2019 as regards the legal\nissue at hand. For example, Finnis 1987 denies that it is possible for\ninterpretation in legal reasoning to lead judges to one right answer\nin the sense claimed in Dworkin 1986, because of pervasive\nincommensurabilities in the criteria by reference to which we are\nsupposed to adjudge one interpretation to be better than another.\nFinnis argues, contra Dworkin, that while we should seek good\nanswers and avoid bad ones, we should not delude ourselves into\ndreaming of uniquely correct answers to issues of legal\ninterpretation, for to do so commits us to, \u2018utilitarianism's\ndeepest and most flawed assumption: the assumption of the\ncommensurability of basic goods and thus of the states of affairs\nwhich instantiate them.\u2019 (Finnis 1987, p. 375). Dworkin (1986\n& 1991) remains firmly committed to the one right answer thesis,\nalthough it should be noted that in Dworkin 1986 chapter 11 he makes\nthe point that in a sense there can be different \u2018right\nanswers\u2019 for different interpreters: \u2018For every route that\nHercules took from that general conception to a particular verdict,\nanother lawyer or judge who began in the same conception would find a\ndifferent route and end in a different place, as several of the judges\nin our sample cases did. He would end differently because he would\ntake leave of Hercules, following his own lights, at some branching\npoint sooner or later in the argument.\u2019 (Dworkin, 1986,\np. 412). Raz 2009 contends that interpretive pluralism is a basic\nfeature of the concept of interpretation as we understand it,\ni.e. that there can be several different and incompatible\ninterpretations of the same object, all of which can be good. \n",
