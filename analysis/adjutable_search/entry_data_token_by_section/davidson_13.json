    "main_text": "Knowledge and Belief || Truth, Predication, and Realism/Anti-Realism\n4.4 Truth, Predication, and Realism/Anti-Realism\n\nDavidson emphasizes the holistic character of the mental (both in\nterms of the interdependence that obtains between various forms of\nknowledge as well as the interconnected character of attitudes and of\nattitudes and behaviour). He has, at times, also referred to his\nposition as involving a \u2018coherence\u2019 theory of truth and of\nknowledge (in \u2018A Coherence Theory of Truth and Knowledge\u2019\n[1983]). Nevertheless, Davidson is not a coherentist, in any standard\nsense, about either truth or knowledge. Nor, for all that he adopts a\nTarskian approach to meaning, does he espouse a correspondence theory\nof truth (in fact, he denies that a Tarskian truth theory is a\ncorrespondence theory in any conventional sense). In general, Davidson\neschews the attempt to provide an account of the nature of truth,\nmaintaining that truth is a central concept that cannot be reduced to\nor replaced by any other notion (see [Davidson 1990a] and [Davidson\n2005b]). Since he takes truth to belong to sentences or statements,\nand not to \u2018propositions\u2019 in any philosophically\nsignificant sense (in Truth and Predication [2005b], he is\nparticularly emphatic in rejecting the idea of the proposition as a\ntheoretical or explanatory concept), Davidson denies that truths can\nbe understood as timeless or eternal (or at least they are no more so\nthan are languages or sentences themselves). The only way of defining\ntruth, as Davidson sees it, is by means of a Tarskian truth theory and\nsuch a theory is not a definition of truth in any unqualified sense,\nbut only a definition of the truth predicate as it applies within a\nparticular language.\n\nDavidson\u2019s employment of the notion of coherence is best viewed,\nnot as a way of understanding truth, but rather as reflecting his\ncommitment to the fundamentally rational and holistic character of the\nmind. It also connects with Davidson\u2019s rejection of those forms\nof epistemological foundationalism that would attempt to ground\nknowledge or belief in the sensory causes of belief \u2013 beliefs,\nas one might expect given Davidson\u2019s holistic approach, can find\nevidential support only in other beliefs. Similarly, Davidson\u2019s\nsometime employment of the notion of correspondence is best\nunderstood, not as providing, any direct elucidation of the nature of\ntruth, but rather as deriving from his externalist commitment to the\nidea that the content of belief is dependent upon the worldly causes\nof belief. In \u2018True to the Facts\u2019 (1969b) Davidson does\ndefend what he there presents as a form of correspondence theory of\ntruth. However, not only does Davidson later relinquish the claim that\nhis is a \u2018correspondence\u2019 view of truth (this is already\nevident in \u2018The Structure and Content of Truth\u2019 [1990a],\nmuch of the material from which was later incorporated into Truth\nand Predication [2005b]), but the account set out in \u2018True\nto the Facts\u2019 is, in any case, far removed from what is usually\ntaken to be involved in any correspondence theory.\n\nThe strategy that Davidson employs in relation to the concept of truth\nreflects a more general approach that runs throughout his thinking.\nRather than trying to reduce key concepts, like truth, to something\nelse, his tendency is to retain the primitive character of those\nconcepts and instead to look to how they are worked out within the\nlarger structure to which they belong (in this respect, Davidson is a\nmoderate \u2018deflationist\u2019 about most of his key concepts).\nThe strategy Davidson adopts in respect of truth is therefore much the\nsame strategy as that which he adopts with respect to meaning (which\nshould not surprise us given the role Tarski plays): meaning belongs\nprimarily to sentences, it is not reducible to any other notion, and\nit is explicated only by reference to a larger linguistic structure.\nMoreover, this strategy is also one Davidson applies to the topic that\noccupies a large part of his last work \u2013 his inquiry into the\nproblem of the problem of predication or of the unity of the\nproposition (2005b). How are we to elucidate the relation between a\nsubject and that which is predicated of it in a standard predicative\nsentence such as \u2018Socrates is mortal\u2019? The problem, like\nthe problem that arises when one tries to use the truth predicate\nreflexively, is that any attempt to explicate the predicative relation\nseems to give rise to circularity or regress. Davidson\u2019s\nsolution is to deny that predication can be explained by resort to any\nprior notion of propositionality. Instead, Davidson takes predication\nas basic, irreducible, and able to be explicated only through the sort\nof structure that is revealed by a Tarski-style theory of meaning.\n\nThe question of truth lies at the heart of the realist/anti-realist\ncontroversy that was once a major concern of many Anglo-American\nphilosophers. Despite his insistence on the indispensability of an\nirreducibly basic concept of objective truth, and his rejection of\nboth sceptical and relativist positions, Davidson has been variously\nassimilated, at different times and by different critics, to both the\nrealist and the anti-realist camps. Yet realism and anti-realism are\nequally unsatisfactory from a Davidsonian point of view, since neither\nis compatible with the holistic and externalist character of knowledge\nand belief. Realism makes truth inaccessible (inasmuch as it admits\nthe sceptical possibility that even our best-confirmed theories about\nthe world could all be false), while anti-realism makes truth too\nepistemic (inasmuch as it rejects the idea of truth as objective). In\nthis respect, and as he himself makes clear (see 1990a, 2005b),\nDavidson does not merely reject the specific premises that underlie\nthe realist and anti-realist positions but views the very dispute\nbetween them as essentially misconceived. This reflects a\ncharacteristic feature of Davidson\u2019s thinking in general (and\nnot just as it relates to realism and anti-realism), namely its\nresistance to any simple classification using the standard\nphilosophical categories of the day.",
