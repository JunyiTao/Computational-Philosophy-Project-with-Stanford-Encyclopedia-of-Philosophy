    "main_text": "Spectrum Inversion in an Argument\u2026 || \u2026For Relativism\n3.5 \u2026For Relativism\n\n\nWe are not quite finished with Argument B:\n\nArgument B\n\nP1.\n\nNeither Invert nor Nonvert is misperceiving the color of the\ntomato.\nP2.\n\nThe tomato is red (and not any other color).\nHence:\n\nC1.\n\nThe tomato looks the same color (namely, red) to both Invert and\nNonvert.\nP3.\n\nIf representationalism is true, then the phenomenal difference\nbetween Invert and Nonvert is due to a difference in the colors that\ntheir experiences represent the tomato as having.\nHence, from C1 and P3:\n\nC2.\n\nRepresentationalism is false.\n\n\n\nSo far, reasons to reject P1 and P3 have been discussed. But one\nmight also question the step from P1 and P2 to C1. As an analogy,\nsuppose that Hare is on a train, looking at a tomato in his lunchbox,\nand that Tortoise is on the platform, looking at the tomato as the\ntrain speeds by. Both Hare and Tortoise have normal vision, in\nparticular, normal visual motion perception. Consider the following\nargument.\n\nArgument B*\n\nP1*.\n\nNeither Hare nor Tortoise is misperceiving the motion of the\ntomato.\nP2*.\n\nThe tomato is moving (not stationary).\nHence:\n\nC1*.\n\nThe tomato looks to be moving to both Hare and Tortoise.\n\n\n\nSince the tomato is moving relative to Tortoise, and is not\nmoving relative to Hare, if P2* is true, it must not be taken\nto mean that the tomato is moving relative to Hare. Assume, then, that\nP2* is given the following true interpretation: the tomato is moving\nrelative to Tortoise. However, Hare does not have to perceive that the\ntomato is moving relative to Tortoise in order to perceive (correctly)\nthe tomato\u2019s motion\u2014perceiving it as not moving\nrelative to himself will also suffice. Hence, Hare\u2019s and Tortoise\u2019s\nexperiences can both be veridical, despite representing the tomato\u2019s\nmotion differently, which is to say that Argument B* is invalid.\n\n\nOne might diagnose a similar mistake in Argument B, and thus endorse\nrelativism about color. According to relativism the tomato is\nnot red simpliciter: rather, it is red relative to Nonvert\n(not green relative to Nonvert), and green relative to Invert (not red\nrelative to Invert). In other words, the tomato is simultaneously\nred-for-Nonvert and green-for-Invert. Since, on this\nview, the tomato looks red-for-Nonvert to Nonvert, and red-for-Invert\nto Invert, both their experiences are veridical, despite representing\nthe tomato differently.\n\n\nWhat is this property of being red-for-Nonvert? The usual answer is\nsomething along the lines of the account of appearance properties in\nShoemaker 2002: something is red-for-Nonvert iff it is disposed to\ncause experiences with \\(R\\) in perceivers of Nonvert\u2019s kind. And\nthis, of course, is essentially the \u201csecondary quality\u201d\naccount of color that many find in Locke. Sometimes relativism is\ncombined with representationalism (McGinn 1983, Tye 1994), but it\narguably fits more naturally with phenomenism (McLaughlin 2003, Cohen\n2004).\n\n\nShoemaker did not block Argument B in this straightforward fashion\nbecause he finds relativism implausible. As he puts it in a review of\nMcGinn 1983:\nSuppose\u2026that overnight we all undergo\nintrasubjective \u2018spectrum inversion\u2019\u2026It cannot\nseriously be maintained that the result of the change would be that\nhenceforth grass \\(is\\) red, port wine green, etc. And it is\nplausible that, once we were accustomed to the change, we would no\nlonger say that grass looks red (for it would look the way we\nhad become accustomed to having green things look). This point is even\nclearer if we imagine that we undergo intrasubjective inversion one at\na time rather than all of us at once. (1986, 411)\n\n\nLike the argument for appearance properties, the argument for\nrelativism can be made by appeal to shifted spectra (see, in\nparticular, Cohen 2004). Averill 1992 argues for a version of\nrelativism using physically possible intrapersonal shifted spectra\nscenarios, involving a slight change in the eye, or in the\n atmosphere.[43]\n",
