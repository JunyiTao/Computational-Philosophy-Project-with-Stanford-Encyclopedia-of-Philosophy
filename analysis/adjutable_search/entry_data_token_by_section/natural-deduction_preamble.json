    "main_text": "\n\n\u2018Natural deduction\u2019 designates a type of logical system\ndescribed initially in Gentzen (1934) and Ja\u015bkowski (1934). It\nalso designates the type of reasoning that these logical systems\nembody. A fundamental part of natural deduction, and what (according\nto most writers on the topic) sets it apart from other proof methods,\nis the notion of a \u201csubproof\u201d \u2014 parts of a proof in\nwhich the argumentation depends on temporary premises (hypotheses\n\u201cassumed for the sake of argument\u201d). In the\nFitch-Ja\u015bkowski presentation of natural deduction, subproofs are\nmarked off in a way that makes them immediately visible in a written\nproof; with other presentations it takes a bit more work to pick out\nthe formulas forming a subproof. Although formalisms differ, an\nunderlying idea is that one is able to \u201cmake an assumption A and\nsee that it leads to conclusion X\u201d, and then conclude that\nif the A were true, then so would X be. (There are\nalso various other types of subproof that we discuss.) Research in\nthis area has concentrated on such topics as (a) Can all natural\ndeduction proofs be put into some \u201cnormal form\u201d?, (b) Do\ndifferent systems of logic require radically different types\nof logical rules?, (c) If different logics require radically different\ntypes of logical rules, does this show that some logics are\n\u201cbetter\u201d than others in some sense?, and (d) Can the\nfeatures that might make some logics be \u201cbetter\u201d than\nothers be employed to characterize the meaning of logical terms (and\nperhaps others) in natural language?\n",
