    "main_text": "The History of the Language of Rights\n3. The History of the Language of Rights\n\nIntellectual historians have disputed the origins of rights. These\ndebates are sometimes framed in terms of when \u201cthe concept of a\nright\u201d emerged. Yet insofar as it is really the emergence of the\nconcept of a right that is at issue, the answer lies beyond\nthe competence of the intellectual historian and within the domain of\nthe anthropologist. Even the most primitive social order must include\nrules specifying that certain individuals or groups have special\npermission to perform certain actions. Moreover, even the most\nrudimentary human communities must have rules specifying that some are\nentitled to tell others what they must do. Such rules ascribe rights.\nThe genesis of the concept of a right was simultaneous with reflective\nawareness of such social norms, however our forebears decided to\ndescribe those norms.\n\nThe more productive characterization of the debate within intellectual\nhistory concerns when a word (or phrase) appeared that has a\nmeaning close to the meaning of our modern word. This debate turns on\nwhen in history the pre-modern \u201cobjective\u201d sense of\n\u201cright\u201d came also to bear our modern,\n\u201csubjective\u201d sense of \u201ca right.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight\u201d in its older, objective sense means \u201cwhat is\njust\u201d or \u201cwhat is fair\u201d (Finnis 1980, 206).\nAristotle uses dikaion, for example, to indicate that a\nsociety is \u201crightly ordered\u201d: that it displays the correct\nstructure of human relationships. \u201cRight\u201d in this\nobjective sense can also be attributed to individuals. The Roman\njurist Ulpian, for instance, held that justice means rendering each\nhis right (ius). In this sense, a person\u2019s\n\u201cright\u201d is what is due to him given his role or status.\nThis objective sense of \u201cright\u201d is not the same as our\nmodern idea of \u201ca right.\u201d For instance, Ulpian noted that\nthe ius of a parricide was to be sewn into a sack of snakes\nand tossed into the Tiber (Tierney 1997, 16).\n\nThere has been a long and divisive scholarly inquiry into when our\nmodern, subjective sense of \u201ca right\u201d became established\nas a meaning of some word or phrase. The history is uncertain partly\nbecause the ancient authors often used words imprecisely, and smeared\ntheir meanings across and beyond the Hohfeldian categories. The\nintellectual historians themselves have occasionally congested the\ndiscussion by taking different features of rights as definitive of the\nmodern concept. Moreover, the scholarly debate has sometimes accepted\nover-optimistic assumptions about the sharpness of conceptual\nboundaries.\n\nNevertheless, two broad trends in the scholarly discussions have\nemerged. The first is to push the origins of a term indicating a\nmodern, subjective sense of \u201ca right\u201d back further into\nhistory: from Locke to Hobbes to Grotius in the seventeenth century,\nthen to Gerson in the fifteenth century, then to Ockham in the\nfourteenth, perhaps even to Gratian in the twelfth (Brett 1997,\nTierney 1997, Siedentop 2014, Lisska and Tierney 2015). Donohue (2010)\neven argues that ius is used in a subjective sense throughout\nthe works of the classical Roman jurists in the first century BCE to\nthe third century CE.\n\nThe second and related trend has been to establish that terms\nreferring to active rights (what we would call privilege-rights and\npower-rights) predate terms referring to passive rights (what we would\ncall claim-rights and immunity-rights). It appears that the earliest\nmedieval debates using recognizably modern rights-language, for\ninstance, concerned topics such as whether the pope has a (power-)\nright to rule an earthly empire, and whether the poor have a\n(privilege-) right to take what they need from the surplus of the\nrich.\n",
