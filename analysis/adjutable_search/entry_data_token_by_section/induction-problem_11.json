    "main_text": "Alternative Conceptions of Justification\n5. Alternative Conceptions of Justification\n\nHume is usually read as delivering a negative verdict on the\npossibility of justifying inference I, via a premise such as\n P8,\n though as we have seen in section\n section 2,\n some have questioned whether Hume is best interpreted as drawing a\nconclusion about justification of inference I at all. In this\nsection we examine approaches which question in different ways whether\n premise P8\n really does give a valid necessary condition for justification of\ninference I and propose various alternative conceptions of\njustification.\n",
