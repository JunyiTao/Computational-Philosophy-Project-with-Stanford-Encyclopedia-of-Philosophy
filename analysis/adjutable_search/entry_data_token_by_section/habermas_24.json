Methodology and Philosophical Framework\n\nIn the transitional period of the 1970s when Habermas began his\ncommunicative turn, he developed various ideas about method that came\nto shape his mature work: for example, rational reconstruction\n (\u00a75.1)\n as a method for critical social theory, postmetaphysical thinking\n (\u00a75.2)\n as a framework for philosophy, and a set of related views about the\nproper role of philosophy.\n",
