    "main_text": "\n\n Daoism[1]\n stands alongside Confucianism as one of the two great\nreligious/philosophical systems of China. Traditionally traced to the\nmythical Laozi \u201cOld Philosopher,\u201d Philosophical Daoism\nowes more to \u201cphilosopher Zhuang\u201d (Zhuangzi)\n(4th Century BCE). Daoism is an umbrella that covers a\nrange of similarly motivated doctrines. The term \u201cDaoism\u201d\nis also associated with assorted naturalistic or mystical religions.\nSometimes the term \u201cLao-Zhuang Philosophy\u201d is used to\ndistinguish the philosophical from the more religious\n\u201cHuang-Lao\u201d (Yellow Emperor-Laozi) strain of Daoist\nthought.\n\nBoth the Daode Jing and the Zhuangzi are composite\ntexts written and rewritten over centuries with varied input from\nmultiple anonymous writers. Each has a distinctive rhetorical style,\nthe Daode Jing terse and poetic, the Zhuangzi\nprolix, funny, elusive and filled with fantasy dialogues. Both texts\nflow from reflections on the nature of\n dao\n (way) and related\n concepts\n that were central to the ethical disputes of Ancient China. The\nconcept of \u201cDaoism\u201d as a theme or group did not exist at\nthe time of the Classical Daoists, but we have some reasons to suspect\nthe communities focusing on the Zhuangzi and Laozi\ntexts were in contact with each other. The texts share some figurative\nexpressions and themes, an ironic detachment from the first order\nmoral issues so hotly debated by the Mohists and Confucians preferring\na reflective, metaethical focus on the nature and development of\nways. Their metaethics vaguely favored different first-order\nnormative theories (anarchism, pluralism, laissez faire government.\nThe meta-ethical focus and the related less demanding first order\nethics mostly distinguishes \u201cDaoists\u201d from other thinkers\nof the period.\n\nThe meta-ethical reflections were by turns skeptical then relativist,\nhere naturalist and there mystical. Daoism per se has no\n\u201cconstant dao.\u201d However, it does have a common\nspirit. Dao-centered philosophical reflection engendered a distinctive\nambivalence in advocacy\u2014manifested in their indirect,\nnon-argumentative style, their use of poetry and parable. In ancient\nChina, the political implication of this Dao-ism was mainly an\nopposition to authority, government, coercion, and even to normal\nsocialization in values. Daoist \u201cspontaneity\u201d was\ncontrasted with subtle or overt indoctrination in any specific or\nsocial dao.\n",
