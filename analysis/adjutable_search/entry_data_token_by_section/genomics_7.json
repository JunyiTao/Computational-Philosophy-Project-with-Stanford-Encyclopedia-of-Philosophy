    "main_text": "Beyond Sequencing || The International HapMap Project\n3.1 The International HapMap Project\n\nThe International HapMap project was a multi-centre project launched\nin 2002 that came to an initial conclusion in 2005 (NIH \n 2002).[14]\nThe acronym \u2018HapMap\u2019 stands for \u2018haplotype map\u2019\nand (indirectly) refers to the main goal of the project, namely to map\nthe common genetic variation in the human genome.\n3.1.1 The HapMap Project and Genomic Variation\n\nIt is a well-known fact that everyone\u2019s genome is different.\nThere are, however, several ways in which genomes of individuals can\nvary from each other, ranging from the deletion, insertion or\nrearrangement of longer stretches of DNA to differences in single\nnucleotides at specific locations on a chromosome. The latter form of\nvariation was the focus of the HapMap project. If we align the DNA\nsequence of two individuals they will be identical for hundreds of\nnucleotides; the DNA of two human beings typically displays about\n99.9% sequence identity (Li & Sadler 1991; Wang et al. 1998;\nCargill et al. 1999). But the 0.1% difference means that approximately\nevery 1000 nucleotides there will be a difference in a single\nnucleotide between any two individuals.\n\nAny variation at a specific genomic locus is referred to as an\n\u2018allele\u2019. If there are two different versions of a\nspecific gene that can be found in a population at a specific locus on\na chromosome, then that means that there are two different alleles of\nthat gene present in that\n population.[15]\n If one of these single nucleotide alleles is found in more than 1% of\na specific population it is treated as a \u2018common\u2019 variant\nand researchers speak of a \u2018polymorphism\u2019 or, more\nprecisely, a \u2018single nucleotide polymorphism\u2019 (abbreviated\n\u2018SNP\u2019; pronounced \u2018snip\u2019). If a variation is\nfound in less than 1% of the population researchers simply call it a\n\u2018mutation\u2019 (or also a \u2018point\n mutation\u2019).[16]\n On average there are about 3 million SNPs found in each individual\nand there is a pool of more than 10 million SNPs present in the human\npopulation as a whole (HapMap 2005).\n\nMany of these alleles are (or have an increased likelihood of being)\ninherited together, meaning that they do not easily become separated\nthrough recombination events during\n meiosis.[17]\n This leads to the non-random association of different alleles at two\nor more loci, a phenomenon that has been dubbed \u2018linkage\ndisequilibrium\u2019 or \u2018LD\u2019. The concept of LD is key\nfor the HapMap project as the fact that some SNPs stay associated\n(whereas the clusters themselves might get separated from each other\nover time by recombination events) explains the haplotype structure of\nthe genome (Daly et al. 2001). The term \u2018haplotype\u2019 simply\nrefers to a particular cluster of alleles (in this case SNPs) that a)\nare on the same chromosomes and b) are commonly inherited as one. The\naim of the HapMap project was to characterize human SNPs, their\nfrequency in different populations and the correlations between them\n(HapMap 2003). The first haplotype map was published in 2005,\nreporting on data from 269 samples derived from four different\npopulations (HapMap 2005). Five years later, a follow up was\npublished, now reporting on data from 1184 individuals sampled from 11\ndifferent populations (HapMap 2010).\n\nThe realization that the structure of genetic variation in the genome\ncan be understood in terms of haplotypes was important for at least\ntwo reasons. First it opened the door for a relatively easy and\nefficient analysis of (single nucleotide) genetic variation in\npopulations: the clustering of SNPs meant that in principle only one\nor a few of the SNPs in each cluster (so-called \u2018tag\nSNPs\u2019) would have to be tested to verify the presence of the\ncluster of variants as a whole. This made the analysis of genetic\nvariation at the level of whole genomes from a large number of\nsubjects feasible at a time when whole-genome sequencing was still too\nexpensive for such a task (HapMap 2003). The development of a\nhaplotype map was therefore a crucial step to enable what are now\ncalled \u2018genome-wide association studies\u2019 (GWAS) (see\n Section 3.1.2).\n\nSecondly, as the distribution of haplotypes varies between different\npopulations, the HapMap project had a strong focus on sampling DNA\nfrom different populations. This is an important aspect of this type\nof research as it brought, unwittingly perhaps, the issue of race and\nthe question of its biological basis right back into genomics. This\npoint will be revisited in\n Section 3.1.4.\n3.1.2 The HapMap, GWAS and the Idea of Personalized Medicine\n\nA key point driving the HapMap project was the fact that SNPs can be\nused to uncover connections between an individual\u2019s DNA sequence\nand specific conditions or traits. At face value an SNP is simply a\ndistinguishing mark in the genome of a person. Such marks allow\nresearchers to screen groups of a population with different\nphenotypes, for instance those with a condition (e.g., high blood\npressure) and those without. Looking at the frequency of specific SNPs\nor haplotypes in either group the researchers can use statistical\nanalysis to get insight into the association between a particular SNP\nor haplotype and a trait (Cardon & Bell 2001). As mentioned above,\nthis analysis can be focused on tag SNPs that are treated as proxies\nfor a whole cluster of SNPs (if the cluster has a high LD).\n\nOnce a haplotype has been associated with a particular condition,\nother people can be screened for the presence of that haplotype and\ntherefore gain some understanding of the risk groups they belong to.\nAlthough the test will not tell carriers of disease-linked SNPs\nwhether they will develop the condition or not, it can nevertheless\ngive them some information about their chances. Furthermore, even\nthough the tag SNP itself might not be the genetic variation that\ncauses or contributes to the variation in phenotype, it might be\nlinked to so-called \u2018causal SNPs\u2019. Learning about SNPs\nassociated with a condition or trait therefore can give the researcher\nclues as to which genes or regulatory DNA regions might be causally\ninvolved in the development of that condition. Findings from\nassociation studies can therefore in some cases contribute to the\nanalysis of the condition itself.\n\nThe HapMap initially only looked for common variants (SNPs include by\ndefinition only common variants). This was in line with the so-called\ncommon disease/common variant (CD/CV) hypothesis formulated by Lander\n(1996); Cargill et al. (1999), and Chakravarti\n (1999).[18]\n This hypothesis postulates, roughly, that common conditions are\nlinked to genetic variations that are common in a population.\n\nThis link between common variants and common diseases also explains\nwhy the HapMap project could be promoted from the very beginning as\nthe \u2018next big thing\u2019 after the sequence of the human\ngenome had been determined: it was with the haplotype map that\ngenomics should really start to have an impact on biomedical research\nand ultimately our understanding of\n disease.[19]\n3.1.3 The HapMap and its Critics\n\nBut the HapMap project was not without its critics; indeed the\nbiologist David Botstein called it a \u201cmagnificent failure\u201d\n(cited in Hall\n 2010).[20]\n Some commentators, for instance, were worried that the project is\nnothing more than a make-work project filling a gap that the finished\nHGP left behind, and therefore a waste of precious funds (Couzin\n2002). But more often, criticism of the HapMap project was part of\nwider debates about the way post-HGP research should be conducted. The\nHapMap project can therefore provide a useful window on some of the\nkey tendencies and disputes that marked (or marred) the post-HGP\nera.\n\nOne such indirect criticism of the HapMap derives from the apparent\nfailure of GWAS to lead researchers to clearer information about the\nlinks between our genetic makeup and the different conditions to which\nour bodies can succumb. In the eyes of these critics the CD/CV\nhypothesis was the key problem, as the common variants simply do not\nexplain much of the heritability of common diseases. This observation\ngave rise to the concept of \u2018missing heritability\u2019\n(Eichler et al. 2010).\n\nThe general focus on common variants in genomics was criticized by\nother authors who claimed that the focus of geneticists should rather\nbe on rare variants (McClellan & King 2010). These rare variants,\nthey claim, are where the missing heritability will be found. The\nproblem with the rare variants is that they cannot be picked up in\nGWAS that use SNP databases, as SNPs are by definition common\nvariants. Also, finding rare variants is a technical challenge as\nresearchers have to analyse the genomic data of a very large number of\nindividuals to do so reliably. This hunt for rare variants is a major\nreason behind the current push for the sequencing of millions (rather\nthan a couple of hundreds or thousands) of genomes. As discussed\nearlier, such large-scale approaches have become feasible in recent\nyears due to the reduced cost and increased speed of next-generation\nDNA sequencing.\n\nThe current shift to whole-genome sequencing will also help to address\nanother critique of the GWAS/SNP/HapMap approach, namely its strict\nfocus on single base pair changes in the genome. Other changes in the\ngenome, such as variations in the numbers of copies of repeated\nelements or rearrangements, deletions or insertions of larger chunks\nof genomic DNA, might in many cases be what is at the core of a\ndisorder, necessitating (again) a shift in focus away from point\nmutations and single genes to the genome as a whole (Lupski 1998,\n2009).\n\nAs one of the first follow-ups to the original HGP, the HapMap project\nwas a topic that often came up in discussions of the legacy of the\nHGP. Such discussions became especially prominent at the tenth\nanniversary of the publication of the draft genome sequence. In\ngeneral, there was an overwhelming sense of disappointment at what had\ncome out of the HPG, at least in the medical context. Given the grand\npromises that were made both around the start of the project in the\n1980s and then again in the year 2000 at the presentation at the White\n House,[21]\n it is not surprising that people were unimpressed by what had been\ndelivered by 2010/2011. Interestingly, it was not only the usual\nsuspects, such as Lewontin (2011), but also key proponents of the HGP itself who were\ncritical and pointed out the minimal medical advances that had been\nachieved in the first post-HGP decade (Collins 2010; Venter 2010).\n\nHowever, one thing that all critics, including the above-mentioned,\nagreed on was that even though its effect on medical practice had been\nnegligible, the HGP had transformed biological research (see for\ninstance Wade 2010; Varmus 2010; Hall 2010; Butler 2010; Green et al.\n2011). One area in which genomic research had fundamentally changed\nboth concepts and practices was in the understanding of what a gene is\nand how gene expression works and is regulated (Keller 2000; Moss\n2003; Dupr\u00e9 2005; Griffiths & Stotz 2006; Stotz et al.\n2006; Check 2010). With great foresight, Evelyn Fox Keller pointed out\nalready in 2000 that the HGP was interesting not so much because of\nthe raw sequence it produced, but more because of the transformations\nit brought about in our expectations when it comes to\n\u2018genes\u2019 and DNA (Keller 2000).\n3.1.4 The HapMap, Genomics and Race\n\nAs mentioned above, HapMap\u2019s use of samples from different\npopulations brought the concept of race into discussions of the\nproject. Studies that looked into the genetic variation between\npopulation groups (of which the HapMap was a key representative) are\namong several recent developments (Duster 2015) that reignited\ndiscussion about a) the biological reality of race and b) the question\nwhether racial classifications should be used in biomedical research\nat all. Several authors have picked up the relation between the HapMap\nproject and a renewed concern with race (see, e.g., Ossorio 2005;\nDuster 2005; Hamilton 2008). The question that dominates these\ndiscussions is whether racial classifications reflect a\n\u2018biological reality\u2019.\n\nRace has of course been an important topic in epidemiology and\nclinical research for a long time (Witzig 1996; Stolley 1999), but it\nhas been widely perceived as a socially constructed category that has\nno biological\n basis.[22]\n And many researchers imagined that as the HGP demonstrated how highly\nsimilar any two human beings are to each other at the DNA level, any\nidea of race as serious biological concept would be disposed of once\nand for all (see, e.g., Gilbert 1992; Venter 2000). But the concept of\nbiological race was if anything rejuvenated rather than laid to rest\nby the developments in genomics (Kaufman & Cooper 2001; Foster\n& Sharp 2002; Hamilton 2008; Roberts 2011). This is exemplified by\nthe fact that more and more scientists have claimed in recent years\nthat there is a biological basis to our traditional notions\nof race, basing their claims on elaborate statistical analyses of data\non genetic variation derived from a large number of human DNA samples.\nThese developments led for many to what Troy Duster has called a\n\u2018post-genomic surprise\u2019 (Duster 2015). \n\nAn important point here is that linking genomics and race does not\nmean that researchers search for, or even that there are, any\n\u2018genes for race\u2019, even if we consider the many different\nways in which this term can be interpreted (Dupr\u00e9 2008). The discussion about the\npossible genetic basis for race is now more subtle, as it is not\nsimply concerned with the presence or absence of specific genes or DNA\nelements and hence some sort of biological essence of races, but\nrather with the variation in the frequencies of alleles in the\npopulation of interest (Gannett 2001, 2004). The question is therefore\nnot whether DNA element X is absent or present in one\npopulation or the other, but rather which variant of X is\npresent at what frequency in a population (in the context of the\nHapMap researchers will talk of SNP frequencies).\n\nData from population genetics shows that the global distribution of\nallele frequencies in the human population is not discontinuous (Jorde\n& Wooding 2004; Feldman & Lewontin 2008) but clinal, meaning\nthat human DNA sequences vary in a gradual manner over geographic\nspace (Livingstone 1962; Serre & P\u00e4\u00e4bo 2004; Barbujani\n& Colonna 2010). Moreover, both genetic and phenotypic traits\ndisplay what is called \u2018nonconcordant\u2019 clinal variation,\nmeaning that different traits do not necessarily co-vary with each\nother; the pattern of how trait A varies across geographic space might\nbe very different from the pattern displayed by trait B (Livingstone\n1962; Goodman 2000; Jorde & Wooding 2004).\n\nBut despite these widely accepted findings, it is in the discussion of\nthese distributions that the idea of a biological basis for our\ntraditional understanding of race classifications has re-emerged.\nBased on the analysis of large sets of genetic variants in samples\nderived from various locations around the globe, a number of\nresearchers have made the claim that human genetic variation displays\ngeographical clustering (see, e.g., Rosenberg et al. 2002; Edwards\n2003; Burchard et al. 2003; Bamshad et al. 2003; Leroi 2005; Tang et\nal. 2005). Importantly, these findings often also gave rise to, or\nwere interpreted to support, the claim that this geographical\ndistribution matches our traditional racial classifications.\n\nSuch findings also led a number of authors to claim that race still\nhas a valid place in biomedical research: since these classifications\nare supposed to describe groups that are internally genetically\nsimilar, but genetically different from other groups, they can serve\nas useful proxies in estimating, for instance, the group\nmember\u2019s average risk of developing a particular condition (see,\ne.g., Xie et al. 2001; Wood 2001; Risch et al. 2002; Rosenberg et al.\n2002; Shiao et al. 2012). Some authors are more cautious and claim\nthat race should only serve as a loose and temporary proxy (Foster\n& Sharp 2002; Jorde & Wooding 2004) that should be abandoned\nas soon as we know the actual genetic variations that are linked to a\nparticular condition or trait (Jorde & Wooding 2004; Leroi 2005;\nDupr\u00e9 2008). Such\ncritics may note that the most that these genetic studies show is that\nthere is a correlation between a person\u2019s genetic variants and\ntheir geographical origin, if only because variants originate in a\nspecific place; and there is a loose relation between the socially\nconstructed concept of race and geographic origin. But given the\ntenuous connection that this generates between perceived or\nself-identified racial categories and genetic constitution, race is a\npoor substitute for any actually salient genetic information that may\neventually be related to disease. \n\nBut there is also a significant group of researchers who are not\nconvinced by these analyses and who don\u2019t think that there is\nany biological basis to the race concept (see, e.g., Schwartz 2001;\nDuster 2005, 2006; Krieger 2000; Ossorio 2005). All of these authors\ncriticise the above studies and the geographic clusters of genetic\nvariation they identify, mainly because of flaws in the way samples\nare collected (see, e.g., Duster 2015) and how the data is ultimately\nanalysed. The latter criticism has mainly focused on the program\n\u2018Structure\u2019 that is used by a majority of the studies\nmentioned above to churn out clusters of genetic variation (Bolnick\n2008; Kalinowski, 2011; Fujimura et al. 2014). A telling criticism is\nthat while Structure can be made to report that there are five main\ngeographical clusters that show distinctive allele frequencies and\nwhich roughly match traditional notions of race (African, Asian,\nEuropean, etc.), the programme can equally be set up to report any\narbitrarily selected number of genetically different groups, as the\nuser has to specify the number of clusters they are looking for before\nthe Structure program is applied to any actual dataset.\n\nTwo interesting aspects of these discussions are that they a) usually\nonly deal with one way of analyzing the biological reality of race\nclassifications (as genetic) and b) adhere to a sharp distinction\nbetween race as biological reality or as social construct. Regarding\na) several philosophers of biology have come up with alternative ways\nof thinking about a biological basis for race (for instance race as\nclades (Andreasen 1998), inbred lines (Kitcher 1999), or ecotypes (Pigliucci &\nKaplan 2003)). This expansion of concepts brought with it the question\nof classificatory monism vs. pluralism, i.e., the question whether\nthere is one privileged way of classifying race that somehow captures\nthe \u2018true nature\u2019 of races (natural kinds) or whether\nthere are several ways of doing so, depending on theoretical or\npractical interests/context (Gannett 2010). As Gannet argues, however,\nthis focus on the monism/pluralism debate and on natural kinds comes\nat a cost, as it can mean that questions of practical significance are\nsystematically ignored (2010). Regarding b), Gannett points out that\ndrawing a sharp distinction between race as social construct or\nbiological reality has not only been proven meaningless by recent work\nin population genetics but can also mean that the much messier reality\nof human history and diversity on this planet (and the complex\ninteractions between scientific and social concepts of race) is being\noverlooked, leading to an impoverished analysis of the problems at\nhand (Gannett 2010).\n",
