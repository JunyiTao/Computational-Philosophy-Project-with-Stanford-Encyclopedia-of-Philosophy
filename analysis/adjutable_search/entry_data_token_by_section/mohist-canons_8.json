    "main_text": "Philosophy of Language || Names and Stuff\n4.1 Names and Stuff\n\nThe Mohists regard all words as various types of \u201cnames\u201d\n(m\u00edng \u540d). They draw no distinction between\ndifferent parts of speech, probably because classical Chinese words\nhave no obvious morphological features to indicate their different\ngrammatical functions. They do identify three types of names,\naccording to the scope of their denotation (A78):\n\u201call-reaching\u201d names, such as \u2018thing\u2019\n(w\u00f9 \u7269), \u201creach to\u201d or denote\nanything. \u201cKind\u201d (l\u00e8i \u985e) names,\nsuch as \u2018horse\u2019, consistently \u201cproceed to\u201d\n(x\u00edng \u884c, go on to be consistently predicable of) all things relevantly similar to each\nother. \u201cPersonal\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d\nnames, such as the proper noun \u2018Jack\u2019,\n\u201cstop\u201d in one thing only, the individual that bears the\nname. Kind names are in effect general terms. They are established by\ndubbing things of a certain kind by that name. Having named something\n\u201chorse,\u201d for example, we are committed to applying the\nsame name to all similar things (A78). (As we will see in section 6, the Mohists also seem to recognize how some general terms might refer to things grouped together on grounds other than being members of the same kind.) \n\nNames are used to talk about various sh\u00ed \u5be6\n(stuff, things, objects, reality). \u2018Sh\u00ed\u2019\ncan be interpreted as roughly \u201cstuff\u201d or\n\u201csolid\u201d and has the connotation of \u201creal\u201d and\n\u201cfull.\u201d Sh\u00ed has a semantic range similar\nto, but broader than, the English \u2018thing\u2019,\n\u2018object\u2019, or \u2018stuff\u2019. It may refer to physical\nobjects, conduct, events, or situations. It is also used to refer to\n\u201cthe facts,\u201d the reality or genuine character of\nsomething, and the actual conduct or ability that matches or warrants\na\n reputation.[8]\n According to ancient Chinese beliefs about nature, everything in the\ncosmos consists of a dynamic, flowing elemental stuff called\nq\u00ec \u6c23 (breath or vapor). When used to refer to\nobjects, sh\u00ed in effect refers to regions where\nq\u00ec has condensed and thickened to fill out space and\nform a solid. The use to refer to \u201creality\u201d or \u201cthe\nfacts\u201d seems to be an extension of this use; in both cases,\nsh\u00ed refers to what is really, solidly there. \n\nAs an object or what is real or factual, sh\u00ed contrasts\nnot with \u201csubject\u201d or \u201csubjective,\u201d but with\nx\u016b \u865b (empty, hollow, insubstantial,\nindeterminate) or with m\u00edng \u540d (name), the\nlinguistic label for the thing referred to. Nor is sh\u00ed\n\u201csubstance,\u201d as contrasted with a set of properties that\nare in, possessed by, or realized by it. What we think of as the\nproperties of a sh\u00ed are all just inherent parts of it.\nInstead of positing an essence or a set of essential properities\ninstantiated by all things of a kind, the Mohists take it as a brute\nfact that sh\u00ed may be similar or different in various\nrespects, and they seek criteria by which to divide them into kinds\nbased on these similarities and differences. As we will discuss when\nwe consider the notions of\n \u201csame\u201d and\n  \u201cdifferent,\u201d\n features they cite as such criteria include \u201cshape and\nlook\u201d (x\u00edng m\u00e0o \u5f62\u8c8c),\n\u201cresidence and migration\u201d (j\u016b y\u00f9n\n\u5c45\u904b), and \u201camount and number\u201d\n(li\u00e0ng sh\u00f9 \u91cf\u6578) (NO2). Whether a\nparticular thing falls within a certain kind, and thus takes a certain\nname, such as \u2018horse\u2019, is determined by comparing it with\na f\u01ce \u6cd5 (model, exemplar) of that kind to see\nwhether they are similar (A70). A particular horse counts a horse\nbecause its \u201clook\u201d or \u201ccharacteristics\u201d\n(m\u00e0o \u8c8c) are \u201clike the model\u201d (A71).\nAs we will see, in some places, the writers of the Canons\nseem to assume that such similarity relations are fixed by nature,\nthough they do not give an explicit defense of this stance. \n\nThe Mohists identify three kinds of \u201ccalling\u201d\n(w\u00e8i \u8b02) (A79), or the speech act of uttering\nnames. The first, \u201cdesignating,\u201d refers to\n\u201clinking\u201d (l\u00ec \u7051/\u5137) two or\nmore names together, as when we say \u201cdogs are hounds.\u201d The\ntext leaves it unclear whether it is referring to predication in\ngeneral, noun predication, or merely introducing a new name for\nsomething, since other passages indicate that \u2018dog\u2019 and\n\u2018hound\u2019 were considered coextensive. Probably the writers\ndo not distinguish clearly between these different cases, and it is\nlikely they are referring generally to all instances of noun\npredication, if not also verbal predication. A second kind of\n\u201ccalling,\u201d \u201capplying\u201d or\n\u201cattaching\u201d (ji\u0101 \u52a0), is illustrated\nby scolding a dog. Other passages in the Mozi suggest that\n\u201capplying\u201d refers to using a term of approval or\ndisapproval of someone in order to praise or reproach the person. One\npossibility, though speculative, is that \u201capplying\u201d might\nrefer to adjectival predication. The third type of speech act is\n\u201cpresenting\u201d (j\u01d4 \u8209, also\n\u201cbringing up\u201d or \u201craising\u201d), which is\nusing a name to talk about something. For instance, uttering the word\n\u2018dog\u2019 or \u2018hound\u2019 is \u201cpresenting\u201d\ndogs or hounds.\n",
