As\nmentioned in subsection 2.1, a significant, if stigmatizing, stage in\nthe formation of the identity of the Kyoto School involved the\nparticipation of several of its members in two wartime symposia, the\nLiterary World\u2019s 1942 symposium on \u201cOvercoming\nModernity\u201d (reprinted in Kawakami & Takeuchi 1979; English\ntranslation in Calichman 2008) and the 1941\u201343 roundtable\ndiscussions published serially in the journal\nCh\u016b\u014dk\u014dron and later as a monograph, The\nStandpoint of World History and Japan (K\u014dsaka et al 1943;\nEnglish translation in Williams 2014).\n\nThe Overcoming Modernity symposium has been aptly\ncharacterized as \u201ca premature challenge to the questions that\nhave yet to be answered today\u201d (Minamoto 1994, 200). Even one of\nthe most critical accounts of this symposium\u2014an account which\nargues that the \u201conly destination reached by the symposium on\novercoming modernity was the place where Japan itself had been\novercome by modernity\u201d\u2014concedes that: \u201cIt is,\nnevertheless, important to point out that the very critique mounted by\nJapanese against modernity prefigured precisely all of those doubts\nand obsessions concerning subjectivity, cultural difference, and even\nracism that have become the signatures of a Western and putatively\nglobal discourse that marks our own historical conjuncture\ntoday\u201d (Harootunian 2000, 94).\n\nAs discussed in subsection 2.2, the Kyoto School participants spoke of\nan overcoming of modernity that can take place only by way of passing\nthrough modernity, a stance that represented a\ncountertendency to the rejection of modern Western rationality by the\nJapanese Romantic School and other participants in the symposium. In\nother words, the Kyoto School participants did not lament the\nmodernization-via-Westernization of Japan, nor did they nostalgically\nplea for a return to a pre-modern age; rather, they called for a\nfurther step forward, but one that would involve creatively recovering\nviable elements of Japanese tradition at the same time as building on\nthe best of what could be learned from the West. This stance shows up\nclearly in Nishitani\u2019s debate with Kobayashi Hideo, who argued\nfor a rejection of modernity and a return to the pre-modern Japanese\nclassics (see Kawakami & Takeuchi 1979, 217ff.). Throughout his\ncareer Nishitani consistently spoke of overcoming modernity only by\nway of passing through it, and in this process tradition was to be\ncreatively appropriated, not conservatively retreated to. He wrote:\n\u201cThere is no turning back to the way things were. \u2026 Our\ntradition must be appropriated from the direction in which we are\nheading, as a new possibility\u201d (NKC VIII, 183; Nishitani 1990,\n179); and: \u201cSimply put, the backward looking return to tradition\nis straightaway to be forward looking\u201d (NKC XIX, 104). Later in\nlife Nishitani continued to stress that Japanese Buddhist\norganizations need to embrace their historicality, which means to\nmodernize and then postmodernize; only in this way can they continue\nto play a vital role in Japanese society as well as offer the\npossibilities of their ways of life to the wider world (Nishitani\n2006, 36\u201338).\n\nIn the Ch\u016b\u014dk\u014dron discussions as well the Kyoto\nSchool resolutely attempted to think from the \u201cstandpoint of\nworld history.\u201d Problematically, however, they asserted a\nleadership role for Japan in the present moment, which they viewed as\na turning point in world history. If the standpoint of world history\nhad indeed been first opened up by both Western universalism\nand imperialism, they argued, it was the non-Western nation\nof Japan that was in a unique position to free the world from the\nchains of the latter in order to realize the true potential of the\nformer.\n\nIn his book written around the same time, View of the World and\nthe Nation (1941), Nishitani went so far as to claim that this\nwas the moment in time when the \u201cfocal point of world\nhistory\u201d was to become the Japanese nation, just as previously\nworld history had centered on the Roman Empire and then later on the\nBritish Empire. However, Nishitani argued, unlike the former two\nempires Japan\u2019s historical mission was to bring about a world\nthat has \u201cno specific center\u201d but rather consists of\nvarious \u201cpolitically and culturally unified spheres\u201d (NKC\nIV, 298\u2013300). The Japanese nation would be able to carry out\nthis mission, he crucially adds, only if it incorporates a religious\nspirit of self-negation, thus becoming what he calls a \u201cnation\nof non-ego\u201d rather than a self-centered aggressive empire (NKC\nIV, 285\u201386). In this idealistic vision, which unfortunately had\nlittle to do with the cruel realities of Japanese expansionism, Japan\nwas to be an altogether new kind of empire, a self-negating and\ncompassionate one that would help other nations to cooperatively form\ntheir own identities, rather than an aggressive and\n\u201cimperialistic\u201d one that would remold others into inferior\nreplicas of itself. (It remains for us to ask how best to characterize\ntoday\u2019s political superpowers and economic empires, and how to\nrelate their ideologies to their realities.)\n\nIf there is a lasting merit to Nishitani\u2019s wartime political\nwritings and the Ch\u016b\u014dk\u014dron discussions, it\nmight be found in part in their critique of the contradictions and\nhypocrisies of Western imperialism (see, for example, K\u014dsaka et\nal. 1943, 348ff.), together with their insistence that Japan\u2019s\n\u201cleading role\u201d in Asia not become that of an imperialist\nor colonizer (see ibid., 204\u20135; also see Nishitani\u2019s\n\u201cMy View of \u2018Overcoming Modernity\u2019,\u201d reprinted\nin Kawakami & Takeuchi 1979, 32). The lasting infamy of the\nCh\u016b\u014dk\u014dron discussions, on the other hand, can\nbe found not only in their idealistic political na\u00efvet\u00e9,\nbut also in their idealization and even whitewashing of political\nrealities (such as Japanese aggression in China and other parts of\nAsia), as well as in such disturbing specific suggestions as that of\n\u201cJapanizing\u201d or \u201chalf-Japanizing\u201d some of the\n\u201cmore superior\u201d ethnic groups in Asia in order to assist\nin instituting the Japanese led \u201cCo-Prosperity Sphere\u201d\n(K\u014dsaka et al. 1943, 262\u201363, 337).\n",
