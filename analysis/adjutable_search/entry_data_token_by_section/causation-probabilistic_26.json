    "main_text": "Actual Causation || Lewis\u2019s Counterfactual Theory\n4.3 Lewis\u2019s Counterfactual Theory\n\nDavid Lewis is the best-known advocate of a counterfactual theory of\ncausation. In Lewis 1973, he offered a counterfactual theory of\ncausation under the assumption of determinism. Lewis 1986b presented a\nprobabilistic extension to this counterfactual theory of\ncausation.\n\nLewis defines a relation of causal dependence that is\nsufficient, but not necessary for causation.\n\n(CD)Event E causally depends upon event \n    C just in case:\n\n(i)C and E actually occur, at times t\n    and \\(t'\\) respectively.\n(ii)At time t, the probability of E was \n    x.\n(iii)If C hadn\u2019t occurred, then at time \n    t the probability of E would have been less than or \n    equal to y.\n(iv)\\(x \\gg y\\).\n\n\nThe counterfactual in (iii) is to be understood in terms of possible\nworlds: it says that in the nearest possible world(s) where C\ndoes not occur, the probability of E is less than or equal to\ny. (There needn\u2019t be a single value that the probability\nwould have been. It can take on different values in the closest\npossible worlds, as long as all of those values are less than or equal\nto y.) On this account, the relevant notion of\n\u2018probability-raising\u2019 is not understood in terms of\nconditional probabilities, but in terms of unconditional probabilities\nin different possible worlds.\n\nLewis defines causation (what we are calling \u201cactual\ncausation\u201d) to be the ancestral of causal dependence;\nthat is:\n\n(Lewis)C causes\nE just in case there is a sequence of events \\(D_1\\), \\(D_2\\),\n\u2026, \\(D_n\\), such that \\(D_1\\) causally depends upon \\(C\\),\n\\(D_2\\) causally depends upon \\(D_1\\), \u2026, E causally\ndepends upon \\(D_n\\).\n\nThis definition guarantees that causation will be transitive: if\nC causes D, and D causes E, then C\ncauses E. This modification is useful for addressing certain\ntypes of preemption. Consider the example from the previous section,\nwhere Suzy throws her rock, preempting Billy. We can interpolate an\nevent D between Suzy\u2019s throw, C, and the\nbottle\u2019s shattering E. Let D be the presence of\nSuzy\u2019s rock on its actual trajectory, at some time after Billy\nhas already failed to throw. If Suzy hadn\u2019t thrown, D\nwould have been much less likely. And if D hadn\u2019t\noccurred, E would have been much less probable. Since D\noccurs after Billy has already declined to throw, if D\nhadn\u2019t occurred, there would not have been any rock on\na trajectory toward the bottle. Thus there is a chain of causal\ndependence from C to D to E. \n\nDespite this success, it has been widely acknowledged (even by Lewis\nhimself) that Lewis\u2019s probabilistic theory has problems with\nother types of preemption, and with probability-raising\nnon-causes.\n4.4. Fenton-Glynn\u2019s Causal Modeling Account\n\nFenton-Glynn (2017) offers an analysis of actual causation that is\nbased on the definition of Halpern and Pearl (2005), who consider only\nthe deterministic case. What follows here is a simplified version of\nFenton-Glynn\u2019s proposal, as one example of an analysis employing\ncausal models.\n\nLet \\(\\bV\\) be a set of time-indexed, binary variables, which we\nassume to include any common causes of variables in \\(\\bV\\) (so that\nthe correct causal graph on \\(\\bV\\) is a DAG). Let \\(*\\) be an assignment\nfunction that assigns to each variable \\(X\\) in \\(\\bV\\) one of its\npossible values. Intuitively, \\(*\\) identifies the actual value\nof each variable. We will denote \\(*(X)\\) by \\(x^*\\), and \\(x'\\)\nwill denote the non-actual value of \\(X\\). If \\(\\bX\\) is a set of\nvariables in \\(\\bV\\), \\(\\bX\\) = \\(\\bx^*\\) will be a proposition stating that\neach variable in \\(\\bX\\) takes the actual value assigned by \\(*\\). Let P\nbe a probability function on \\(\\bV\\) representing objective\nprobability, which we assume to satisfy the Markov and Minimality\nConditions (Sections\n 3.3\n and\n 3.4\n above). We also assume that P assigns positive probability to every\npossible assignment of values to variables in \\(\\bV\\).\n\nGiven the identifiability result described in\n Section 3.5\n above, we can recover the correct causal graph \\(\\bG\\) from the probability\nfunction P together with the time-indices of the variables. We can now\nuse P and \\(\\bG\\) to compute the effects of interventions, as described in\n section 3.6\n above. We now define actual causation as follows:\n\n(F-G)Let \\(X, Y \\in \\bV\\). \\(X = x^*\\) is an actual cause \n    of \\(Y = y^*\\) just in case there is a partition \\(\\{\\bZ, \\bW\\}\\) \n    of the variables in \\(\\bV \\setminus \\{X, Y\\}\\) such that for every \n    \\(\\bU \\subseteq \\bZ\\): \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\PP(Y = y^* &\\mid do(X = x^*, \\bW = \\bw^*, \\bU = \\bu^*))\\\\\n \\mathbin{\\gt} &\\PP(Y = y^* \\mid do(X = x',\\bW = \\bw^*))\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nIntuitively, this is what is going on: If \\(X = x^*\\) is an actual\ncause of \\(Y = y^*\\) then there has to be at least one directed path\nfrom \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\). \\(\\bZ\\) will consist of variables that lie\nalong some (but not necessarily all) of these paths. (If \\(X\\) is a\ndirect cause of \\(Y\\), then \\(\\bZ\\) can be empty.). F-G requires\nthat \\(X = x^*\\) raises the probability of \\(Y = y^*\\) in the sense that\ninterventions that set \\(X\\) to \\(x^*\\) result in higher\nprobabilities for \\(Y = y^*\\) than interventions that set \\(X\\) to\n\\(x'\\). Specifically, \\(X = x^*\\) must raise the probability of \\(Y =\ny^*\\) when we also intervene to set the variables in \\(\\bW\\) to their\nactual values. \\(\\bW = \\bw^*\\) is like a background context of the sort\ndiscussed in\n Section 2.4,\n except that \\(\\bW\\) may include some variables that are descendants\nof \\(X\\). Moreover, \\(X = x^*\\) must raise the probability of \\(Y =\ny^*\\) in conjunction with any combination of variables in \\(\\bZ\\) being\nset to their actual values. The idea is that the probabilistic impact\nof \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) is being constrained to flow through the\nvariables in \\(\\bZ\\), and at every stage in the process, the value of\nthe variables in \\(\\{X\\} \\cup \\bZ\\) must confer a higher probability\non \\(Y = y^*\\) than the baseline probability that would have resulted\nif \\(X\\) had been set to \\(x'\\).\n\nLet\u2019s see how this account handles the problem cases from\n section 4.2.\n For the example of preemption, we will use the following\nvariables:\n\n \\(\\ST_0= 1\\) if Suzy throws, 0 if not\n \\(\\BT_1= 1\\) if Billy throws, 0 if not\n \\(\\BS_2 = 1\\) if the bottle shatters, 0 if not\n\n\nThe subscripts indicate the relative times of the events, with larger\nnumbers corresponding to later times. The actual values of the\nvariables are \\(\\ST_0= 1\\), \\(\\BT_1= 0\\), and \\(\\BS_2= 1\\). The\nprobabilities are: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\PP(\\BT_1= 1 \\mid \\ST_0= 1) &{} = .1 \\\\\n\\PP(\\BT_1= 1 \\mid \\ST_0= 0) &{} = .9 \\\\[1ex]\n\n\\PP(\\BS_2= 1 \\mid \\ST_0= 1 \\amp \\BT_1= 1) &{} = .95\\\\\n\\PP(\\BS_2= 1 \\mid \\ST_0= 1 \\amp \\BT_1= 0) &{} = .5\\\\\n\\PP(\\BS_2= 1 \\mid \\ST_0= 0 \\amp \\BT_1= 1) &{} = .9\\\\\n\\PP(\\BS_2= 1 \\mid \\ST_0= 0 \\amp \\BT_1= 0) &{} = .01\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n(Note that we have added a small probability for the bottle to shatter\ndue to some other cause, even if neither Suzy nor Billy throw their\nrock. This ensures that the probabilities of all assignments of values\nto the variables are positive.) The corresponding graph is shown in\nFigure 9.\n\n\n\nFigure 9\n\n\nApplying F-G, we can take \\(\\bW = \\{\\BT_1\\}\\), \\(\\bZ = \\varnothing\\).\nWe have: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\PP(\\BS_2= 1 \\mid \\do(\\ST_0= 1) \\amp \\do(\\BT_1= 0)) &{} = .5\\\\\n\\PP(\\BS_2= 1 \\mid \\do(\\ST_0= 0) \\amp \\do(\\BT_1= 0)) &{} = .01\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nHolding fixed that Billy doesn\u2019t throw, Suzy\u2019s throw\nraises the probability that the bottle will shatter. Thus the\nconditions are met for \\(\\ST = 1\\) to be an actual cause of \\(\\BS =\n1\\).\n\nTo treat the case of fizzling from\n Section 4.2,\n let\n\n \\(\\ST_0= 1\\) if Suzy throws, 0 if not\n \\(\\BT_0= 1\\) if Billy throws, 0 if not\n \\(\\SH_1= 1\\) if Suzy\u2019s rock hits the bottle, 0 if not\n \\(\\BH_1= 1\\) if Billy\u2019s rock hits the bottle, 0 if not\n \\(\\BS_2= 1\\) if the bottle shatters, 0 if not\n\n\nThe actual values are \\(\\ST_0= 1\\), \\(\\BT_0= 1\\), \\(\\SH_1= 1\\),\n\\(\\BH_1= 0\\), and \\(\\BS_2= 1\\). The probabilities are:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\PP(\\SH_1= 1 \\mid \\ST_0= 1) &{} = .5\\\\\n\\PP(\\SH_1= 1 \\mid \\ST_0= 0) &{}  = .01\\\\[2ex]\n\n\\PP(\\BH_1= 1 \\mid \\BT_0= 1) &{} = .9\\\\\n\\PP(\\BH_1= 1 \\mid \\BT_0= 0) &{} = .01\\\\[2ex]\n\n\\PP(\\BS_2= 1 \\mid \\SH_1= 1 \\amp \\BH_1= 1) & {} = .998 \\\\\n\\PP(\\BS_2= 1 \\mid \\SH_1= 1 \\amp \\BH_1= 0) & {} = .95\\\\\n\\PP(\\BS_2= 1 \\mid \\SH_1= 0 \\amp \\BH_1= 1) & {} = .95 \\\\\n\\PP(\\BS_2= 1 \\mid \\SH_1= 0 \\amp \\BH_1= 0) & {} = .01\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nAs before, we have assigned probabilities close to, but not equal to,\nzero and one for some of the possibilities. The graph is shown in\nFigure 10.\n\n\n\nFigure 10\n\n\nWe want to show that \\(\\BT_0= 1\\) is not an actual cause of \\(\\BS_2=\n1\\) according to F-G. We will show this by means of a dilemma: is\n\\(\\BH_1\\in \\bW\\) or is \\(\\BH_1\\in \\bZ\\)?\n\nSuppose first that \\(\\BH_1\\in \\bW\\). Then, regardless of whether\n\\(\\ST_0\\) and \\(\\SH_1\\) are in \\(\\bW\\) or \\(\\bZ\\), we will need to\nhave  \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\PP(\\BS_2 = 1 &\\mid do(\\BT_0= 1, \\BH_1= 0, \\ST_0= 1, \\SH_1= 1))\\\\\n       \\mathbin{\\gt} &\\PP(\\BS_2 = 1 \\mid do(\\BT_0= 0,\\BH_1= 0, \\ST_0= 1, \\SH_1= 1))\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nBut in fact both of these probabilities are equal to .95. If we\nintervene to set \\(\\BH_1\\) to 0, intervening on \\(\\BT_0\\) makes no\ndifference to the probability of \\(\\BS_2= 1\\).\n\nSo let us suppose instead that \\(\\BH_1\\in \\bZ\\). Then we will need to\nhave  \n\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\PP(\\BS_2 = 1 &\\mid do(\\BT_0= 1, \\BH_1= 0, \\ST_0= 1, \\SH_1= 1))\\\\\n       \\mathbin{\\gt} &\\PP(\\BS_2 = 1 \\mid do(\\BT_0= 0, \\ST_0= 1, \\SH_1= 1))\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThis inequality is slightly different, since \\(\\BH_1= 0\\) does\nnot appear in the second conditional probability. Nonetheless we have\n \n\n\\[\n\\PP(\\BS_2 = 1 \\mid do(\\BT_0= 1, \\BH_1= 0, \\ST_0= 1, \\SH_1= 1)) = .95\n\\]\n\n\nand \n\n\\[\n\\PP(\\BS_2 = 1 \\mid do(\\BT_0= 0, \\ST_0= 1, \\SH_1= 1)) = .9505\n\\]\n\n\n(The second probability is a tiny bit larger, due to the very small\nprobability that Billy\u2019s rock will hit even if he doesn\u2019t\nthrow it.)\n\nSo regardless of whether \\(\\BH_1\\in \\bW\\) or is \\(\\BH_1\\in \\bZ\\),\ncondition F-G is not satisfied, and \\(\\BT_0= 1\\) is not judged to be\nan actual cause of \\(\\BS_2= 1\\). The key idea is that it is not enough\nfor Billy\u2019s throw to raise the probability of the bottle\nshattering; Billy\u2019s throw together with what happens afterwards\nhas to raise the probability of shattering. As things actually\nhappened, Billy\u2019s rock missed the bottle. Billy\u2019s throw\ntogether with his rock missing does not raise the probability\nof shattering.\n\nNote that this treatment of fizzling requires that we include\nvariables for whether the rocks hit the bottle. If we try to model\nthis case using just three variables, \\(\\BT\\), \\(\\ST\\), and \\(\\BS\\),\nwe will incorrectly judge that Billy\u2019s throw is a cause of the\nbottle shattering. This raises the question of what is the\n\u201cright\u201d model to use, and whether we can know if we have\nincluded \u201cenough\u201d variables in our model. Fenton-Glynn\n(2017) includes some discussion of these tricky issues.\n4.5 Conclusion and Further Reading\n\nWhile this section describes some success stories, it is safe to say\nthat no analysis of actual causation is widely believed to perfectly\ncapture all of our pre-theoretic intuitions about hypothetical cases.\nIndeed, it is not clear that these intuitions form a coherent set, or\nthat they are perfectly tracking objective features of the world.\nGlymour et al. (2010) raise a number of challenges to the general\nproject of trying to provide an analysis of actual causation.\n\nThe anthologies Collins et al. 2004 and Dowe & Noordhof 2004\ncontain a number of essays on topics related to the discussion of this\nsection. Hitchcock 2004b has an extended discussion of the problem\nposed by fizzlers. Hitchcock 2015 is an overview of Lewis\u2019s work\non causation. The entry for\n counterfactual theories of causation\n discusses Lewis\u2019s work, and counterfactual theories of\ncausation more generally. ",
