    "main_text": "Kant on sympathy and duty\n5. Kant on sympathy and duty\n\nTo assess the role that sympathy should play in our relations with\nother human beings, it will be helpful to consider Kant\u2019s\ndiscussion of this question in the Groundwork of the \nMetaphysics of Morals (1785). He notes that \n\n\nmany souls are so compassionately disposed that, without any further\nmotive of vanity or self-interest, they find an inner pleasure in\nspreading joy around them. (4:398) \n\n\nHe is by no means contemptuous of them\u2014on the contrary, he says\nthat they \u201cdeserve praise and encouragement\u201d (4:398). But\nnot the highest praise or the strongest encouragement. \n\nWhat they do not deserve, he says, is our \u201cesteem\u201d,\nbecause their motivation \u201chas no genuinely moral worth\u201d.\nThat is because the \u201cmaxim\u201d of what they do \u201clacks\nthe moral merit of such actions done not out of inclination but out of\nduty\u201d (4:398). Kant means that these people are not following a\nrule when they help others\u2014a rule, rationally acceptable to all,\naccording to which all those who are in such and such circumstances\nought to be helped because it is morally right to do so. (The term\n\u201csuch and such circumstances\u201d is a place-holder for a\nphrase stating in general terms what those circumstances are.) These\ncompassionate people act instead on an emotional basis: they are\npained by the misfortunes of others, and they know that if they offer\ntheir help, they will give themselves pleasure. That is a good motive,\nKant thinks, but it ought not to be one\u2019s sole or primary reason\nfor helping others.\n\nKant elaborates on his claim by imagining a transformation in one of\nthese sympathetic and compassionate people: suppose someone\u2019s\nmisfortunes have brought him sorrows that extinguish his feeling for\nothers. He retains his power to \u201cassist others in\ndistress\u201d but now \u201ctheir adversity no longer stir[s]\nhim\u201d. He feels no \u201cinclination\u201d to help them, but\ndoes so nonetheless, simply because he believes he has a moral duty to\ndo so. Kant says that when this happens, this man\u2019s character\nand his action have \u201cmoral worth\u201d\u2014whereas\nthey had none before. His motive is now \u201cincomparably the\nhighest\u201d\u2014not only is it better than before, but, because\nit is now a moral motive, it has a kind of value that takes priority\nover every other kind (4:398).\n\nWhat should we make of this? To begin with, we should acknowledge that\nif someone assists another person because he is aware of that\nperson\u2019s suffering and is distressed by it, he may not be acting\nfor the most admirable of motives. For example, if you hear someone\ncrying, and this leads you to help him, you may be motivated solely by\nyour desire for a good night\u2019s sleep, which you could not have\nhad, had he continued to cry. Alleviating his pain was not your\nultimate end \u2013it was just a way to quiet him down, so that you\ncould enjoy some peace. We might say that you \u201cdid a good\nthing\u201d, but you don\u2019t deserve any praise or admiration for\ndoing so. But this falls far short of vindicating Kant\u2019s claim.\nThis is not really a case of acting compassionately, because it was\nnot that other person\u2019s suffering you cared about\u2014only his\ncrying, and only because this distressed you.\n\nBefore we move closer to the sort of case that Kant is discussing, it\nwill be helpful to engage in a thought experiment due to Robert Nozick\n(1974: 42\u20135). He imagines an \u201cexperience machine\u201d in\nwhich a neuroscientist manipulates your brain so that you can have any\nexperiences of your choosing. Those experiences would be illusory, but\nthey could be as lifelike, rich, and complex as you choose. You might,\nfor example, enter the machine in order to have an experience exactly\nlike that of climbing Mt. Everest; you would be lying on a table with\nyour brain attached to the machine, but it would be exactly as though\nyou were facing great danger, wind, cold, snow, and so on. Nozick\nclaimed that we would not choose to plug into the machine, and rightly\nso, because there is much of value beyond the experiential component\nof our lives.\n\nWith this device in mind, let\u2019s return to Kant\u2019s\ncompassionate souls who \u201cwithout any further motive of vanity or\nself-interest, \u2026 find an inner pleasure in spreading joy around\nthem\u201d. We can offer them the opportunity to plug into the\nexperience machine, and it would then seem to them as if they were\n\u201cspreading joy around them\u201d. They would not in fact be\nhelping anyone, but it would seem to them as though they were, and\nthat would fill them with joy. Clearly, there would be little or\nnothing to admire in those who would enter the machine on these terms.\nBut what about a compassionate person who refuses this offer, and\nprefers to find joy in actually helping people\u2014not merely in\nseeming to help them? To be more precise, we might offer someone the\nfollowing choice: (a) You will experience great joy in the machine,\nimagining yourself to be helping others; (b) you will experience less\njoy outside the machine, but it will be joy taken in actually helping\nothers. A genuinely compassionate person would choose (b). He would be\ngiving up a certain amount of pleasure in order to be of use to\nothers. And there is certainly something admirable about that.\n\nAccording to Kant, however, there is still something of great worth\nthat is missing in the motivation of this genuinely compassionate\nperson, willing though he is to make some sacrifice in his own\nwell-being for the sake of others. His reason for helping is not that\nit would be morally wrong to fail to do so\u2014wrong because he\nwould be violating a moral rule that makes it a duty for him to help\nthem. What motivates him to aid others is simply that he is inclined\nto do so. If he did not take any pleasure in being of assistance, he\nwould not do so.\n\nWe should agree with Kant that there are situations in which it would\nbe morally wrong for one person to refuse to help another, whether\nthat person has fellow feeling for others or not. For example, suppose\na child needs to be taken to the hospital, and it so happens that you\ncan do so at some small cost or inconvenience to yourself. Although\nthis child is a stranger to you, you are someone who finds children\nadorable and likes to be with them. And so you willingly accompany the\nchild to the hospital. Your love of children is admirable, but you\nwould still be subject to criticism, if that were your sole motivation\nfor assisting this child. By hypothesis, in the situation we are\nimagining, it would be wrong to refuse\u2014and yet the wrongness of\nrefusing, by hypothesis, is not one of your motives.\n\nBut Kant\u2019s point is of limited application, for there are many\nother kinds of situation in which assisting others for their sake is\nadmirable but not a moral duty. Suppose, for example, a novelist takes\ntime away from her work each day in order to read to blind people in\nher community. She does not have a moral obligation to assist those\npeople; she helps them because she loves books and she wants to spread\nthe joy she takes in literature to others. Perhaps at some point in the\nfuture, her interests will change\u2014she might no longer write\nnovels, and she might get no pleasure from reading to others. She might\nthen no longer volunteer to read to the blind. Kant must say that the\nhelp given by this writer does not deserve our \u201cesteem\u201d\nand \u201chas no genuinely moral worth\u201d, because she acts from\ninclination rather than duty. But it is implausible to withhold these\nwords of praise. The author does not read to others merely as a means\nto advance her career or her own well-being. Although she enjoys\nreading to others, she may believe that it would be better for her to\nspend more of her time working on her own writing projects. She makes\nsome sacrifices because she believes that other people\u2019s lives\nwill improve if she can instill in them the joy she takes in these\nbooks. Surely her motives have \u201cmoral worth\u201d in the normal\nsense of that term: her reason for acting is to help others.\n\nRecall Kant\u2019s thought experiment in which a person full of\nsympathy and compassion suffers severe misfortunes that extinguish all\nof his feeling for others. He is still able to benefit others, and he\nstill has a strong sense of duty. Kant seems to be implying that if\nsuch an individual continues to \u201cassist others in\ndistress\u201d because he sees that he has a duty to do so, then\nthere is no moral defect in him at all. His motivation, on the\ncontrary, is exemplary, because it has \u201cmoral worth\u201d\n(unlike the motivation of the individual who is moved by inclination\nand fellow feeling). Surely Kant is right that we ought not to lower\nour opinion of him merely because he has experienced severe\nmisfortunes\u2014assuming that he did not bring them on himself. He\nsays that the adversity of others \u201cno longer stir[s]\u201d this\npoor soul, and presumably he would add that this emotional condition\nis not this unfortunate man\u2019s fault either. But even if there is\nnothing blameworthy in this man\u2019s emotional\nindifference to the good of others, it is also true that his\nrelationship with others has been damaged. He cannot respond\nto others as he should. Lacking any inclination to spread joy to\nothers, when he undertakes projects that fulfill his duty to promote\ntheir happiness or diminish their unhappiness, he will do so in a\njoyless, dutiful manner, thereby tarnishing the relationship he ought\nto have with them. If, for example, he volunteers to read to the\nblind, he will be unable to communicate to them a love of\nliterature\u2014for he himself feels no \u201cinner pleasure\u201d\nwhen he reads, and has no inclination to help others, due to his own\nsuffering. When he receives news of his adult children\u2019s\nmisfortunes, he will not respond with sympathy or\ncompassion\u2014such news will simply leave him cold (although he\nwill fulfill his parental duties, if his assistance is morally\nrequired). It would be appropriate, then, to say that this man\nexhibits significant moral defects. He lacks the motivation\nto act towards others as he should, and to feel for others as he\nshould. \n",
