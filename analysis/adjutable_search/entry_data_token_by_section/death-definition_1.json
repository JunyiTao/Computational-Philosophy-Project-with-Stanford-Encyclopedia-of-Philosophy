    "main_text": "A Progressive Alternative: The Higher-Brain Approach\n2. A Progressive Alternative: The Higher-Brain Approach\n\nAccording to the higher-brain standard, human death is the\nirreversible cessation of the capacity for consciousness.\n\u201cConsciousness\u201d here is meant broadly, to include any\nsubjective experience, so that both wakeful and dreaming states count\nas instances. Reference to the capacity for consciousness\nindicates that individuals who retain intact the neurological hardware\nneeded for consciousness, including individuals in a dreamless sleep\nor reversible coma, are alive. One dies on this view upon entering a\nstate in which the brain is incapable of returning to consciousness.\nThis implies, somewhat radically, that a patient in a PVS or irreversible\ncoma is dead despite continued brainstem function that permits\nspontaneous cardiopulmonary function. Although no jurisdiction has\nadopted the higher-brain standard, it enjoys the support of many\nscholars (see, e.g., Veatch 1975; Engelhardt 1975; Green and Wikler\n1980; Gervais 1986; Bartlett and Youngner 1988; Puccetti 1988; Rich\n1997; and Baker 2000). These scholars conceptualize, or define, human\ndeath in different ways\u2014though in each case as the irreversible\nloss of some property for which the capacity for consciousness is\nnecessary. This discussion will consider four leading argumentative\nstrategies in support of the higher-brain approach.\n",
