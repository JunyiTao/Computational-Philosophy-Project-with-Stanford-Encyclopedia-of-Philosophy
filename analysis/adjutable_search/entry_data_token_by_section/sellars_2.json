    "main_text": "Language and Being || Semantics\n3.1 Semantics\nSellars takes an unorthodox approach to language, but it is also\ncrucial for his naturalistic metaphysics.  The key to his view is that\nsemantic terms and descriptions provide functional classifications of\nlinguistic tokens.  His analysis of meaning statements such as \n\n\u2018Rot,\u2019 in German, means red\n\n or \n\n\u2018Brother\u2019 means male sibling\n\ntreats them as statements that convey the information that the word\nmentioned on the left-hand side has a relevantly similar usage to the\nphrase on the right-hand side.  These meaning statements, however, do\nnot explicitly say that the two expressions they each contain\nhave the same usage.  Rather, each sentence presupposes that the\nperson it is directed at already understands the background language,\nin this case English, and uses the expression on the right-hand side\nas an illustrating sortal to form an indexical predicate\n(forming a predicate by giving an example bearing the relevant\nproperty), which is then applied to the tokens picked out by\nthe expression on the left-hand side of the sentence.  Sellars\ninvented a device, dot-quotation, to express this formally.  Dot\nquotation forms a common noun (not a name) that applies to every item in any\nlanguage that functions in a relevantly similar way to the quoted\nexpression.  \u2022Red\u2022 is a common noun true of any expression\nthat functions like the English word \u2018red.\u2019 Thus, Sellars\nanalyzes \n\n\u2018Rot,\u2019 in German, means red\n\nas\n\n\u2018Rot\u2019s, in German, are \u2022red\u2022s.\n\n\u201cAccording to this analysis, meaning is not a relation\nfor the very simple reason that \u2018means\u2019 is\na specialized form of the copula\u201d (MFC: 431).  \nReference is also given a functional analysis. Reference, unlike meaning,\nis extensional.  While we can say that\nboth\n\n\u2018Venedig\u2019 (in German) refers to Venice\n\nand\n\n\u2018Venedig\u2019s are German \u2022Venice\u2022s\n\nare true, we can\u2019t say that both\n\n\u2018Die K\u00f6nigin der Adria\u2019 (in German) refers to Venice\n\nand\n\n\u2018Die K\u00f6nigin der Adria\u2019s are German \u2022Venice\u2022s\n\nare true.  The first member of each pair is true, but \u2018die\nK\u00f6nigin der Adria\u2019 has a different sense from\n\u2018Venice,\u2019 because it is a descriptive phrase and has an\ninternal syntactic and semantic complexity that the proper name\n\u2018Venice\u2019 does not.  Sellars guarantees the extensionality\nof reference by introducing a quantifier into his analysis of\n\u2018refers\u2019 statements.  He takes reference statements to\nquantify implicitly over senses, that is, functions of expressions,\nand then defines an extensional relation of material or extensional\nequivalence between senses (see SM III \u00a763: 84).  Our example\nsentences are then analyzed, where \u2018S\u2019 is variable over\nsenses (so that \u2018S\u2019 is a higher-order substitutional variable whose substituends are sortals such as \u2022Venice\u2022), as \n\nFor some S, \u2018Venedig\u2019 (in German) stands for S,\nand S is materially equivalent to \u2022Venice\u2022\n\nand\n\nFor some S, \u2018Die K\u00f6nigin der Adria\u2019(in\nGerman) stands for S, and S is materially equivalent to\n\u2022Venice\u2022.\n\nThe idea of a reference relation is the heart of orthodox semantic\ntheory in contemporary logic and the philosophy of language, but\nSellars denies that reference is a relation, just as he denies that\nmeaning is a relation.  The same goes for truth, which classical\ntheories try to understand through some correspondence relation\npurported to hold between sentences and the world.  Sellars endorses\ninstead a pragmatist conception of truth:\n[F]or a proposition to be true is for it to be assertible,\nwhere this means not\ncapable of being asserted \u2026 but correctly\nassertible; assertible, that is, in accordance with the relevant\nsemantical rules, and on the basis of such additional, though\nunspecified, information as these rules may require\u2026 .\n\u2018True\u2019, then, means semantically assertible\n(\u2018S-assertible\u2019) and the varieties of truth correspond to\nthe relevant varieties of semantical rule (SM, IV, \u00a726:\n101).\nThe \u201cvarieties of truth\u201d Sellars speaks of include\nempirical truth (which involves the picturing relation mentioned\nbelow), mathematical truth, legal truth, moral truth, etc. \nThis is a version of a use theory of meaning.  Sellars\ndistinguishes three different generic dimensions of usage:\nlanguage-entry transitions, intralinguistic transitions, and\nlanguage-exit transitions.  Some examples: Contexts of perception and\nobservation are those in which one enters a language in\nresponse to some form of sensory stimulation.  The announcement of a\nresolution followed by an action that attempts to carry it out is a\ncase of exiting a language.  Intralinguistic transitions\ninclude inferences and responses of one kind or another.  In\ncontrast to Quine\u2019s emphasis on occasion sentences, Sellars puts\nparticular emphasis on the importance of intralinguistic connections,\nan aspect of his view that has been further developed in Robert\nBrandom\u2019s inferentialism.  Sellars distinguishes formal\ninferences, which are a matter of the syntactic rules of the language,\nfrom material inferences, which are not a function of syntactic\nstructure alone.  The inference from \u2018This is red\u2019 to\n\u2018This is colored\u2019 is one example of a material inference,\nbut, in Sellars\u2019s view, so is the inference from \u2018It is\nraining\u2019 to \u2018The street will be wet\u2019.  Material\ninferences are not merely enthymemes ultimately to be made good by\nsupplying an explicit principle: the web of material inferences an\nexpression is involved in, especially the subjunctives it sustains,\ndetermines its core meaning.\nSellars has a complex view of what ties language to the world.  In\nthe first instance, language is tied to the world, not by a single\nreference (or \u2018satisfaction\u2019) relation, but by the\nmultitude of relationships \u2014 causal (in both directions),\nspatio-temporal, and normative \u2014 between tokens of linguistic\nexpressions and the world.  Sellars does, however, single out for\nspecial attention a relation he calls picturing.  Though the\nnotion of picturing is inspired by early Wittgenstein, in\nSellars\u2019s version it is a natural, non-semantic relation\nbetween objects, not facts.  The relata are, on the one hand,\nwhat Sellars calls \u2018natural linguistic objects,\u2019 tokens of\nlinguistic expressions, and, on the other hand, objects in the world.\nThe basic idea is that in any empirically meaningful language, the\noccurrences of a certain class of linguistic events (namely,\nfirst-level, atomic, matter-of-factual statements playing roles in\nobservational and volitional contexts) have to constitute a map\nor picture of the surrounding environment in virtue of an\nisomorphism between the properties of worldly objects and counterpart\nproperties of the linguistic events.  Sellars thinks this is a\ncondition on any empirically meaningful language, but he also\nbelieves that one of the tasks of science is to improve the accuracy\nand refine the grain of such an isomorphism.  Sellars\u2019s notion\nof picturing has puzzled many, but we can see an influence on Ruth\nMillikan\u2019s biosemantics, as well as Huw Price\u2019s recent\n(2011, 2013) distinction between e-representation and\ni-representation. \n",
