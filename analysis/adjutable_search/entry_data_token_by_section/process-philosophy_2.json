Beyond traditional \u2018bifurcations\u2019: process-philosophical approaches to old questions\n\nThe best way to show that the core assumptions of the substance\nparadigm are not laws of thought is to dispense with them while\nworking out philosophical accounts that are anchored in a new research\nparadigm. Whitehead\u2019s philosophy still is the most\ncomprehensive, systematic, and detailed proposal for such a\nfundamental theory revision, but, as often remarked upon, the depth of\nWhitehead\u2019s philosophical revision does not make for easy\naccess. Accordingly, contemporary processists fall essentially into\nthree groups. The first group pursues the task of explicating\nWhitehead\u2019s philosophy to the philosophical mainstream, e.g., by\nputting metaphilosophical issues centerstage (Auxier and Herstein\n 2017).[6]\n The second group adopts selected insights or elements of\nWhitehead\u2019s scheme, partly without attribution, in order to work\nout, in mainstream terminology, a solution to a specific problem. The\nthird group develops distinctly non-Whiteheadian routes into process\nphilosophy, guided by research in linguistics or new branches and\nresults of science. In the following the focus will be on the third\ngroup, with occasional pointers to contributions to the second.\n\nThe last mentioned research line in contemporary analytical process\nphilosophy takes its departure from mid-20th century philosophical and\nlinguistic research on discourse about occurrences. Zeno Vendler\n(1957) and Anthony Kenny (1963) argued that actions can be sorted into\nvarious types according to certain logical and linguistic features of\nverbs denoting these actions. The resulting classifications of\n\u201caction types\u201d are similar, but Vendler\u2019s fourfold\ndivision operated with fewer criteria and thus proved more\ninfluential: whether a \u201cverb\u201d denotes a\n\u201cstate\u201d, \u201cactivity\u201d,\n\u201caccomplishment\u201d, or \u201cachievement\u201d depends on\nwhether in present tense the progressive form needed, whether it can\nbe combined with the verb \u201cfinish,\u201d or whether it applies\nan any moment of a temporal interval at which it applies. Certain\nproblems with Vendler\u2019s and Kenny\u2019s classifications were\nfirst noted by linguists Henk Verkuyl (1972) and Barry Taylor (1977).\nMost seminal, however, was Alexander Mourelatos\u2019 (1978)\nobservation that the distinctions that Vendler and Kenny tried to\ncapture do not pertain to the lexical semantics of \u201caction\nverbs\u201d but to the semantics of entire sentences, and not of\nsentences about actions but about occurrences in general. This renders\nthe classificatory task much more complex than Vendler and Kenny\nenvisaged. Since then the linguistic discussion has produced (under\nthe keywords \u201cAktionsart,\u201d \u201cverbal aspect,\u201d\nand \u201caspectuality\u201d) a plethora of theories about the many\ndifferent ways in which natural languages express the dynamic aspects\nof a situation. These linguistic theories provide essential data for\nanalytical process ontology, but one must not overlook that there are\nlanguage-specific interplays between verb semantics, tense system, and\naspectual meanings, and that ontology should be guided by inferential\ndifferences that hold across\n languages.[7]\n\nInformed by these early inquiries into the inferential characteristics\nof occurrence types, analytical process ontologists have offered\nvarious criteria sets for the classification of occurrences and their\nrelationships to other categories: some promote a division between\nongoing (\u201cprocesses\u201d) and completed (\u201cevents\u201d)\noccurrences, while others argue that ongoing occurrences should be\ndistinguished further into non-developmental and developmental\n processes.[8]\n There is also considerable disagreement on how to categorize these\noccurrence types: are they concrete or abstract? Are they particular\nor general entities? Mourelatos also showed that the logical criteria\nof Vendler\u2019s and Kenny\u2019s classifications actually function\nin two ways: they can be used to distinguish various types of\noccurrences such as processes and events, but they also highlight\ninferential analogies between processes and stuffs on the one hand,\nand events and things on the other hand. Most analytical processists\ncharacterize processes (or which ever label is used for the basic\ncategory) as dynamic individuals that are concrete particulars or else\nare abstract general patterns. By contrast, heeding the inferential\nanalogies in our reasoning about activities and stuffs, \u201cGeneral\nProcess Theory\u201d rejects the presupposition that concrete\nindividuals need to be particulars: \u201cgeneral processes\u201d\n(or \u201cdynamics\u201d) are introduced as a new ontological\ncategory of concrete, dynamic entities that are non-particular (i.e.,\npossibly multiply occurrent in space and time), determinable, and\n\u201cfunctionally individuated\u201d (by contextually determined\nsections of process\n networks).[9]\n However, both particularist and non-particularist interpretations\nagree that processes cannot be individuated in terms of their\nspacetime location alone and cannot be identified with\nmaterially filled space-time regions, thus parting company with\n\u201cfour-dimensionalism,\u201d (a position in contemporary\nontology that is occasionally misunderstood as a process-based\napproach). Furthermore, while processists agree that processes combine\nand that they exhibit common features, there is disagreement on how to\narticulate such process combinations (e.g., by a special mereology),\nand whether the shared patterns of processes belong into a different\ncategory (as Whitehead suggested) or are themselves processes as\nwell.\n\nIn short, analytical process philosophy has worked out concepts and\ntheories of its own, however pedestrian and patchwork, as an\nalternative to Whitehead\u2019s sophisticated system of categories,\nand there is a multitude of approaches within analytical process\nontology. Besides different classifications of occurrences and\ndifferent ontological characterizations of processes, there appear to\nbe two research lines, one with focus on the role of processes in the\nphilosophy of time, action, or experience (see e.g. the work of Antony\nGalton, Rowland Stout, and Helen Steward), and one with focus on the\nrole of processes in scientific reasoning (see section 4 below).\nDespite all differences in constructive detail, however, Whiteheadian\nand non-Whiteheadian process philosophy both recommend themselves as\ngateways to renovating philosophical discourse by deconstructing\ntraditional dichotomies. Here are just a few of the topics where\nprocessists promise philosophical advance.\n\n(i) Beginning with a familiar Whiteheadian move, the rejection of the\ntraditional \u201cbifurcation of nature\u201d into a physical and a\nmental domain, the process approach opens up new ways of looking at a\nwide variety of issues, and in particular on the relationship between\nmind and nature. Whiteheadians argue that the traditional mind-body\nproblem dissolves if all basic constituents of reality are short-lived\nprocesses of information transfer that exhibit both\n\u2018mental\u2019 and \u2018physical\u2019 aspects in different\naccentuations according to context. Quite independently of\nWhitehead\u2019s philosophy and commitments to panpsychism, a number\nof analytical philosophers have argued that the present-day debate in\nphilosophy of mind and philosophy of action has been hampered by an\nontology that is focused on upshots (states, and state-like events)\nand promote a theoretical \u2018Gestalt\u2019 switch in the\nmetaphysics of experience and agency (Stout 2017). Helen Steward\n(1997, 2012) criticizes the standard conception of perception and\nagency as a causal sequence of states, some of which are physical and\nsome mental; in order to make room for agentive freedom within the\nnatural world Steward proposes that we view agency as a special form\nof downward causation, taking our bearings from the hierarchical\nsystems of functioning in biological organisms (2017). Others have\npointed out that our common sense (teleological) explanations of\nactions commit us to ongoing occurrences (Stout 1996) or that we can\nbest make sense of the unity of our experience if we take processes to\nbe the objects of our experiences rather than states or things\n(Soteriou\n 2013).[10]\n The so-called \u201cdynamical hypothesis\u201d in cognitive science\n(Van Gelder 2000) generated a line of philosophical research on\ndynamic models of the mind that is strongly guided by scientific\nresearch, especially by cognitive science using a connectionist model\nof the mind (see below).\n\n(ii) Similarly, as non-Whiteheadian analytical processists have\npointed out, process metaphysics reconfigures the traditional problem\nof universals since it abandons the substance-metaphysical principle\nthat concrete entities are fully determinate while general or\nindeterminate entities are abstract (i.e., they must not be, undergo,\nor initiate\n changes).[11]\n\n(iii) Processists also have offered novel approaches to the problem of\npersistence, either by taking persistent entities to be\n\u201cenduring\u201d patterns of processes (Whitehead), or by\nquestioning the idea that \u201cperdurance\u201d vs.\n\u201cendurance\u201d accounts of persistence form a theoretically\nnecessary exclusive\n dichotomy.[12]\n\n(iv) The dichotomy of \u2018fact\u2019 and \u2018norm,\u2019 some\nprocessists argue, is another traditional \u201cbifurcation\u201d\nthat can be bridged. Some natural processes realize a certain form of\nlow-degree normativity. In some process organizations (e.g.,\nfar-from-equilibrium systems) each component process presupposes every\nother for its own occurrence; in the context of these particular\nprocess organizations the dependence amongst the single processes is\nnot merely a matter of linear causation but constrained by the\nsimultaneous interactions of the entire system, ensuring that each\nprocess is \u2018functional for\u2019 the occurrence of the\n system.[13]\n\n(v) Finally, the process approach also can be used to sidestep\ntraditional dichotomies in the philosophy of religion. While the\nopposition between \u201cimmanence\u201d and\n\u201ctranscendence\u201d traditionally is taken to amount to an\nexclusive alternative, whether in application to universals or to God,\nthe tools of process metaphysics allow us to pursue a third option\nthat exploits the explanatory grammar of the \u2018mode.\u2019 We\noften consider the mode or way in which a process, or collection of\nprocesses, occurs as a separate kind of process (compare, e.g.,\nscratching a violin string with a bow vs. playing a tone on the\nviolin; or a free market economy vs. a planned economy). Processes\nthat are modifications of other processes are both immanent in the\nsense that they affect (by constraining and enabling) how the modified\nprocesses occur, but are transcendent in the sense that they are\nmultiply realizable, that is, they are not themselves dependent on the\nparticular spatio-temporal occurrences of the processes that realize\n them.[14]\n\nIn addition, there is a host of other contemporary issues where\nattention to processes generates novel answers that advance our\nunderstanding of the familiar questions of philosophy in important\nways, even without challenging some central, defining, dichotomy.\nCases in point are the \u2018process account of causation\u2019\n(Salmon 1984,\n 1997)[15]\n or N. Rescher\u2019s processist analysis of knowledge. Offering\ndetailed reconstructions of the procedures of knowledge production,\nRescher argues that rational inquiry, including science, is the\nprocess of creating coherent theories that systematize what we have\nestablished as data with increasing complexity (Rescher 1982). That\nthis method of inquiry can yield (temporary) truths is justified by\nits practical success, but the method is essentially (a) interminable\nand (b) progressive, since: (a1) each knowledge claim contains\npresuppositions that raise new questions; (a2) reality is\n\u201ccognitively inexhaustible\u201d; and (b) since the increasing\ncomplexification of scientific knowledge can count as cognitive\nprogress, even though such progress may not be discernible as\ncumulative or linear advance (Rescher 1977, 1978, 1984). For claims\n(a2) and (b) Rescher supplies process-metaphysical underpinnings,\nendorsing a view of nature as continuously evolving and a view of\nevolution as directed towards increasing complexity (Rescher 1996,\n2006 ch. 10, and 2012; see also below section 6).\n\nPerhaps the clearest example for the progress that a processist\napproach can bring to longstanding tasks of philosophy is in the\ntheory of selfhood and personhood. Whatever cultural notions of\n\u2018person\u2019 and \u2018self\u2019 we may have acquired, our\nimmediate self-awareness reveals us to ourselves as engaged in doings\nand undergoings. What we find ourselves to be doing and undergoing we\nunderstand as belonging to a space of possible occurrences. We notice\npatterns in what might possibly be going on with us, and some of these\npatterns we use to identify ourselves: in terms of our talents,\nskills, capabilities, traits, dispositions, habits, inclinations, and\ntendencies to action and inaction. It is integral to your\nself-awareness at this moment that your reading is yours, the\nreading of a self that is the same over time. But the sameness of this\nself we experience not as the sameness of a time-invariant thing but\nas the sameness of an \u2018operation\u2019 of integration\u2014an\nongoing unification of experienced patterns in ways that enable a\nfirst-person perspective. Some process philosophers have taken the\nexperience of dynamic sameness in self-experience as the basis for\nconstructing a process-metaphysical account of personhood that defines\nthe core self as a unified manifold of actions and capacities,\ntendencies, and dispositions to (physical or psychical) actions (see\ne.g. Rescher 1996 ch.6). In this way they preserve a concept of\npersonhood that renders the self or ego experientially accessible. The\nunity of a person is a unity of experience\u2014the coalescence of\nall of one\u2019s diverse micro-experiences as part of one unified\nmacro-process. Importantly, processists do not equate the\ncross-temporal unity of a person-process with a sequence of momentary\ntotal states of consciousness, as neo-Humean accounts currently\npostulate; rather, it is the sort of unity of process that links each\nminute\u2019s happenings into a single overall journey. From the\nprocess point of view a self just is the complex process\ncomposed of various physical interactions, experiences, feelings,\nmoods, and actions in their systemic interrelationship. The whole\nindividual person is continuously \u2018in the making\u2019 or being\nconstituted, yet it also continuously influences which components\n(e.g., experiences, feelings, actions) enter into the constitution of\nthe whole and in which ways these components occur. Such circular\ndependencies between a whole and its parts cannot be accommodated\nwithin a theory of individuals that is committed to the basic\nconstructional principles of the substance paradigm, especially the\nclaim that concrete individuals are fully determinate. Relationships\nof mutual constitution are legitimate theoretical tools within process\nontologies where entangled recursive definitions are not in conflict\nwith basic tenets about individual entities. By extending the dynamic\ndependencies among the component processes of a self to include\naspects of the person\u2019s physical and social context, a process\naccount of persons can formulate in a differentiated and\nscientifically informed fashion various claims about the formative\nrole of our\n environments.[16]\n\nHarking back to (Claim 2) and (Claim 3) above, extant process-geared\ntreatments of familiar topics surely provide considerable support for\nthe claim that process philosophy is viable (Claim 2). But in the eyes\nof many processists (Claim 3) matters most\u2014as the next section\nwill sketch, currently it may be process philosophy\u2019s primary\nasset that it enables us to articulate and address important new\nquestions raised by modern science.\n",
