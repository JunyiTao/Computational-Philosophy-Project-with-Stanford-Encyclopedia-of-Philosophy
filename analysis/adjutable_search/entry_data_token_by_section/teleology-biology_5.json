    "main_text": "Natural Selection Accounts || Direct Natural Selection Approaches\n4.2 Direct Natural Selection Approaches\n\nAccounts of biological function which refer to natural selection\ntypically have the form that a trait's functions causally explain\nthe existence or maintenance of that trait in a given population via\nthe mechanism of natural selection. William Wimsatt (1972), Ruth\nMillikan (1984), and Karen Neander (1991a), all treat the past history\nof natural selection as the selection process that legitimizes the\nnotion of a biological function. Within such approaches there is a\ndispute about the exact role of natural selection, whether as a source\nof variation (sometimes referred to as the \u201ccreative\u201d role\nof natural selection, e.g., Neander 1988; see also Ayala 1970, 1977),\nor only as a filter on variations that arise independently (Sober\n1984). \n\nPositions which ground functional claims in natural selection have\nmuch in common with Wright\u2019s etiological account. However,\nbecause the grounding is specific to biology, they may avoid the kinds\nof counterexamples to Wright\u2019s account introduced by critics\nsuch as Christopher Boorse, predicated on the idea that Wright\u2019s\naccount is intended to provide a more general conceptual analysis. A\nrelated challenge stems from the claim that pre-Darwinian thinkers\nsuch as Harvey correctly identified functional properties of\nbiological organs, and that natural selection cannot therefore be a\nrequirement for the proper conceptual analysis of function. Defenders\nof direct natural selection accounts of function have responded in\ndifferent ways. One way, exemplified by Millikan (1989), is to argue\nthat conceptual analysis has no role to play in articulating what is\nessentially a theoretical term within modern evolutionary biology.\nAnother way, exemplified by Neander (1991b), is to say that the task\nof conceptual analysis is appropriate but restricted to the concepts\nof the relevant scientific community. \n\nPaul Davies (2001) and Arno Wouters (2005) argue that both Millikan\nand Neander are incorrect to treat malfunction as an important\ntheoretical or conceptual aspect of the practice of attributing\nfunctions by biologists. Wouters declares the wish that the study of\nbiological function should be liberated \u201cfrom the yoke of the\nphilosophy of mind\u201d (2005: 148). However, Ema Sullivan-Bissett (2017) argues\nthat while the task of explicating biological practice by philosophers\nof biology is usefully distinguished from the broader goals of\nphilosophers pursuing naturalistic accounts of mind and language (see\nthe entry on\n teleological theories of mental content),\n the latter serves legitimate goals. She regards an account of\nmalfunction to be integral to the latter project even if not to the\nformer. Davies (2001) argues that the natural selection accounts are\nunable to provide an account of malfunction insofar as they\nindividuate traits functionally, entailing that a putatively\nmalfunctioning trait is not an instance of the functionally-defined\nkind. Sullivan-Bissett addresses Davies\u2019 objection by\nincorporating a structural condition on the individuation of traits.\n(See also Garson 2016: 48\u201349, for additional discussion and\ncritique of Davies\u2019 view.) \n\nReturning to the kinds of traits studied by biologists, some theorists\nmake a distinction between the initial spread of a new phenotypic\ntrait in a population and the more recent maintenance of traits in\npopulations. Take a trait such as feathers, arising in a population by\nwhatever means. Initially this trait may have spread because of a role\nin mating displays. Later, feathers may have contributed to improved\nthermoregulation. And still later, the trait may have become more\nwidely distributed because feathers make good flight control surfaces.\nIf display or thermoregulatory functions of feathers become less\nimportant in some niches, the trait may nonetheless be maintained in a\npopulation due to selection for its flight-control function. The\nshifting functional profile may also be correlated with\ndifferentiation in form, such as between downy feathers and flight\nfeathers.\n\nSome biologists used the term pre-adaptation to capture the idea that\na trait selected for one function may turn out to be very useful for\nsomething else. However, Gould and Vrba (1982) introduced the term\n\u2018exaptation\u2019 to capture such transitions, and avoid what\nthey saw as the overly teleological implications of pre-adaptation, as\nwell as to recognize that non-selected traits of organisms could also\nbe co-opted to serve a function, increasing fitness without having any\nfurther modification by natural selection (Lloyd & Gould 2017).\nCritics of the etiological natural selection approaches sometimes\nargue that backward-looking approaches are too vague with respect to\nquestions about the point at which traits acquire or lose functions,\nand that they are consequently untestable empirically (Amundson &\nLauder 1994). Godfrey-Smith (1994) independently proposed a\n\u201cmodern history\u201d theory of functions to address these\nproblems. Similarly, Griffiths (1993: 417) invokes a notion of the\n\u201clast evolutionarily significant time period\u201d to handle\nthese issues, but many critics remain unconvinced (e.g., Wouters 1999;\nDavies 2001). \n\nAnother issue confronting direct natural selection accounts is the\nevident utility of attributing functions to novel traits of organisms\ndeveloped within a single lifetime such as the capacity of brains to\nacquire new concepts of kinds of things not previously experienced in\nthe evolutionary lineage, or of the immune system to develop\nantibodies to new infectious agents. Previously, Millikan (1984) had\nsuggested a notion of \u201cderived proper function\u201d to capture\nthis kind of example. More recently, Bouchard (2013) and Garson (2017)\nhave developed more detailed accounts of derived function,\nrespectively using \u201cdifferential persistence\u201d and\n\u201cdifferential retention\u201d within an organism\u2019s\nlifespan to play the role that differential reproduction plays in\ndirect natural selection accounts. \n\nSome biologists and philosophers of biology have been motivated by\nproblems with the backward-looking etiological approach, or by seeing\nexamples from biology that seek to identify the present functions of a\ntrait. To deal with these issues they propose a dispositional or\nforward-looking approach that analyzes function in terms of those\neffects it is disposed to produce that tend to contribute to the\npresent or future maintenance of the trait in a population of\norganisms. Various ways of spelling this out include Hinde\u2019s\n(1975) account of strong function, Boorse\u2019s (1976, 2002)\nbiostatistical theory, Bigelow and Pargetter\u2019s (1987) propensity\ntheory, and Walsh\u2019s (1996) relational theory (see also and Walsh\n& Ariew 1996). \n",
