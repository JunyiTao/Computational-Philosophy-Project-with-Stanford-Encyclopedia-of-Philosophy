    "main_text": "Mind and Matter as Dual Aspects || Further Developments\n6. Conclusions\n\nThe historical motivation for exploring quantum theory in trying to\nunderstand consciousness derived from the realization that\ncollapse-type quantum events introduce an element of randomness, which\nis primary (ontic) rather than due to ignorance or missing information\n(epistemic). Approaches such as those of Stapp and of Beck and Eccles\nemphasize this (in different ways), insofar as the ontic randomness of\nquantum events is regarded to provide room for mental causation, i.e.,\nthe possibility that conscious mental acts can influence brain\nbehavior. The approach by Penrose and Hameroff also focuses on state\ncollapse, but with a significant move from mental causation to the\nnon-computability of (particular) conscious acts.\n\nAny discussion of state collapse or state reduction (e.g. by\nmeasurement) refers, at least implicitly, to superposition states\nsince those are the states that are reduced. Insofar as entangled\nsystems remain in a quantum superposition as long as no measurement\nhas occurred, entanglement is always co-addressed when state reduction\nis discussed. By contrast, some of the dual-aspect quantum approaches\nutilize the topic of entanglement differently, and independently of\nstate reduction in the first place. Inspired by and analogous to\nentanglement-induced nonlocal correlations in quantum physics,\nmind-matter entanglement is conceived as the hypothetical origin of\nmind-matter correlations. This exhibits the highly speculative picture\nof a fundamentally holistic, psychophysically neutral level of reality\nfrom which correlated mental and material domains emerge.\n\nEach of the examples discussed in this overview has both promising and\nproblematic aspects. The approach by Beck and Eccles is most detailed\nand concrete with respect to the application of standard quantum\nmechanics to the process of exocytosis. However, it does not solve the\nproblem of how the activity of single synapses enters the dynamics of\nneural assemblies, and it leaves the mental causation of quantum\nprocesses as a mere claim. Stapp\u2019s approach suggests a radically\nexpanded ontological basis for both the mental domain and status-quo\nquantum theory as a theory of matter without essentially changing the\nformalism of quantum theory. Although related to inspiring\nphilosophical and some psychological background, it still lacks\nempirical confirmation. The proposal by Penrose and Hameroff exceeds\nthe domain of present-day quantum theory by far and is the most\nspeculative example among those discussed. It is not easy to see how\nthe picture as a whole can be formally worked out and put to empirical\ntest.\n\nThe approach initiated by Umezawa is embedded in the framework of\nquantum field theory, more broadly applicable and formally more\nsophisticated than standard quantum mechanics. It is used to describe\nthe emergence of classical activity in neuronal assemblies on the\nbasis of symmetry breakings in a quantum field theoretical framework.\nA clear conceptual distinction between brain states and mental states\nhas often been missing. Their relation to mental states is has\nrecently been indicated in the framework of a dual-aspect\napproach.\n\nThe dual-aspect approaches of Pauli and Jung and of Bohm and Hiley are\nconceptually more transparent and more promising. Although there is\nnow a huge body of empirically documented mind-matter correlations\nthat supports the Pauli-Jung conjecture, it lacks a detailed formal\nbasis so far. Hiley\u2019s work offers an algebraic framework which\nmay lead to theoretical progress. A novel dual-aspect quantum proposal\nby Primas, based on the distinction between tensed mental time and\ntenseless physical time, marks a significant step forward,\nparticularly as concerns a consistent formal framework.\n\nMaybe the best prognosis for future success among the examples\ndescribed in this overview, at least on foreseeable time scales, goes\nto the investigation of mental quantum features without focusing on\nassociated brain activity to begin with. A number of corresponding\napproaches have been developed which include concrete models for\nconcrete situations and have lead to successful empirical tests and\nfurther predictions. On the other hand, a coherent theory behind\nindividual models and relating the different types of approaches is\nstill to be settled in detail. With respect to scientific practice, a\nparticularly promising aspect is the visible formation of a scientific\ncommunity with conferences, mutual collaborations, and some\nperspicuous attraction for young scientists to join the field. \n",
