    "main_text": "Arguments for Closed Borders || Distributing State Benefits\n1.3 Distributing State Benefits\n\n\nA related but distinct argument for closed borders focuses on the\ndistribution of state benefits like welfare payments and health\ninsurance. The basic idea here is that countries like Sweden and\nCanada, for instance, must limit immigration in order to sustain\nanything like their current provision of state benefits. If an\naffluent welfare state placed no restrictions on who could enter, then\nmasses of poor people from around the world would flock to this country\nin order to take advantage of its provision of health and welfare\nbenefits. Indeed, presumably so many would immigrate that there\nwould be no way for this state to continue distributing these benefits\nat anything like their current rate. Thus, given the existing\nlevels of global poverty, it appears as though you can have open\nborders or welfare states, but you cannot have both.\n\n\nIt seems hard to deny that rich welfare states like the Scandinavian\ncountries would be inundated with migrants if they lifted all\nrestrictions on immigration, but not everyone agrees that this fact\nnecessarily justifies keeping people out. A libertarian, for\ninstance, would likely regard this as just one more reason to abandon\nthe welfare state. That is, faced with the choice between either\nrespecting everyone\u2019s right to freedom of movement or designing\nstates that can effectively guarantee ample levels of health coverage\nand welfare transfers to their citizens, the libertarian would favor\nthe former. It is important to recognize, though, that these are\nnot the only two options; the best answer may lie in some middle ground\nbetween these two stark alternatives. In particular, perhaps\nexisting welfare states could open their borders to everyone and then\nprovide no, or at least delayed, welfare benefits to newcomers.\nImagine, for instance, if Sweden stipulated that immigrants would have\ntheir income and wealth taxed from the moment they entered the country,\nbut they would not become vested until they had contributed to the\nstate coffers for something like five years. If immigrants were\nforced to contribute during a waiting period, such an arrangement would\npresumably strengthen rather than jeopardize the host state\u2019s\ncapacity to provide state benefits. Thus, while some would no\ndoubt object to newcomers facing a period in which they were net\nlosers, this proposal at least shows that welfare states need not be\nincompatible with open borders.\n\n\nFinally, even if all attempts to square open borders with wealthy\nwelfare states are problematic, this argument does not support the\nright of all countries to design and enforce their own immigration\npolicies. More modestly, it would show only that wealthy welfare\nstates may do so as long as the world is characterized by profound\ninternational inequality.\n",
