    "main_text": "Ethics and Religion\n6. Ethics and Religion\n\nLeibowitz\u2019s view of mitzvoth has important implications for the\nrelationship between ethics and religion in general and more\nspecifically for the relationship between ethics and halakhah.\nLeibowitz does not deny that there is a genuine realm of ethical\nvalue, writing that both the theocentric (religious) and\nanthropocentric (Kantian) conceptions of value are\n\u201clegitimate\u201d (Judaism, 208). Leibowitz certainly\nrecognizes that beyond the realm of halakhah \u201cflourish many good\ndeeds and events of grandeur and sublimity\u201d (Judaism,\n25). Generally for Leibowitz, halakhah is not all-encompassing and\ndoes not govern all behavior, as he makes explicit in his interviews\nwith Michael Shashar where he asks rhetorically whether Judaism has a\nperspective on the decision whether to build a bridge over a\nparticular river (Sihot, 91). For Leibowitz then, there are\nclearly other aspects of human life that are necessary, indeed\nvaluable, and that need not be dedicated to the worship of God. If,\ntherefore, one is acting for the sake of one\u2019s fellow man, one\nmust simply recognize that this is the performance of a noble ethical\nact, not a holy religious act. What Leibowitz stresses is the\nimportance of not confusing the one with the other.\n\nSo religion, it might be argued, must be the highest value for\nLeibowitz to which all others are subordinated in times of conflict;\nit need not be the only value. Religious values just cannot be\nsubordinated to ethical values which, since dictated by human\ninterests for Leibowitz, are profane by definition. Ethics, as\nLeibowitz notes, is the \u201catheistic category par\nexcellence\u201d (Judaism, 18), placing man at the apex of\nour values in place of God. In contrast:\n\n\nThe Torah does not recognize moral imperatives stemming from\nknowledge of natural reality or from awareness of man\u2019s duty to\nhis fellow man. All it recognizes are Mitzvot, divine\nimperatives. (Judaism, 18)\n\n\nUnsurprisingly given the above, much has been made of the formal\nsimilarities between Leibowitz\u2019s approach to mitzvoth and\nKantian ethics. Both stress \u201cworship lishmah\u201d\n\u2013 or the categorical nature of both the ethical and halakhic\nimperative, neither of which can be instrumental means to ends beyond\nthe respective duties themselves. It is just that Kantian ethics\n\u201cworships\u201d man \u201clishmah,\u201d or as an\nend in himself, while religion worships God. Moreover, as with Kantian\nmoral imperatives, the upshot of acting on religious imperatives for\nLeibowitz is autonomy. But while ethical action is autonomous for Kant\ninasmuch as it is a deliverance of our own practical reason, that very\nfact means that for Leibowitz ethical action is not an\nexpression of human autonomy, but of our enslavement to our own\nnature. Recalling that for Leibowitz man is simply a part of nature\nlike any other, when acting in accordance with that nature, man is\n\u201cin effect, nothing but a robot activated by the forces of\nnature, just like the cattle grazing in the pasture, which are also\n\u2018free from the Torah and Mitzvoth\u2019; that is, from any law\nexternally imposed\u201d (Judaism, 21).\n\nThough perhaps his rhetoric gets the better of him in comparing man\nacting on his own nature to an animal acting on its own nature,\nLeibowitz\u2019s central and apparently incompatibilist point is that\nfreedom cannot be a function of acting according to one\u2019s own\nnature if man\u2019s nature \u201cis only the last link in a causal\nchain of the forces of inorganic and organic nature which act upon him\nand within him\u201d (ibid.). If this is the case, then the ethical\ndictates of human reason no more render man autonomous than do the\n\u2018acts\u2019 of his digestive system. Man is only \u201cfree\nfrom the bondage of nature because he lives a life that is contrary to\nnature,\u201d and thus \u201cemancipation from the bondage of nature\ncan only be brought about by the religion of the Mitzvoth\u201d\n(Judaism, 22).\n\nYet this contrast with Kant actually betrays a deeper similarity. Kant\nsees ethical action as the route to autonomy precisely because it is\nthrough practical reason that we transcend our own nature and make\ncontact with the noumenal realm. In effect therefore, and despite\nKant\u2019s wish to keep religion and ethics apart from a\nmotivational perspective, Kant and Leibowitz are in agreement that\nhuman autonomy requires that man transcend his phenomenal nature. The\ndifference is that while for Kant ethics is, in a certain sense,\ntranscendent \u2013 at least transcending man\u2019s empirical if\nnot his rational nature \u2013 for Leibowitz ethics remains a\nfunction of human nature and therefore mired in the\n\u201cphenomenal\u201d realm destined never to escape.\nLeibowitz\u2019s view of autonomy appears to depend again on his\nthoroughgoing \u201cnaturalism\u201d in regard to the physical and\nhuman world. Only the realm of mitzvoth can effect the sort of\nLeibowitzian \u201ctranscendence\u201d that yields autonomy.\n\nNotably, Brafman argues that this idea enables Leibowitz to\n\u201coffer an argument to the effect that service of God is actually\nthe most fitting value for an individual to adopt\u201d (Brafman,\n2015, 157). For Brafman, Leibowitz can argue that at least at the\naxiological level, one can proclaim the superiority of service of God\nto all other axiological choices. In brief, precisely because\npractical reason (correctly applied) \u201ccoerces\u201d us to a\nsingle conclusion, for Leibowitz it cannot be the seat of autonomy\nthat Kant claims it to be. Only a choice that is not rational, one\ndevoid of any humanly understood value, can be truly autonomous. And\nas we have seen above, for Leibowitz, it is service of God alone that\nmeets this standard. Thus, the only truly free act, and thus the only\nact that is fully value-bearing, is that of serving God through\nhalakhah since \u201chalakhic norms satisfy no natural or rational\nhuman concern\u201d (ibid., 160). If we wish then to base the\ndivinity of the mitzvoth on their meaning as opposed to any historical\nevent of revelation, the meaning of the mitzvoth that marks them out\nas divine is, in a sense, their very\n\u201cmeaninglessness.\u201d\n\nIt is this total lack of rationality, however, that leads to\nBenbassat\u2019s aforementioned Kierkegaardian reading of Leibowitz.\nFor Benbassat, Leibowitz\u2019s view of halakhic practice cannot be\ndeontological since that would require \u201can objective foundation\nof duty that allows it to be recognized as valid regardless of\nend-determinations\u201d (2015, 148). Kant provides that objective\nfoundation through his account of practical reason. Leibowitz,\nhowever, presents halakahic practice as a groundless conative\ncommitment, the basis for the validity of which is simply faith,\nunderstood as \u201ca purely subjective positing of a superior\nend\u201d (ibid, 149), that end being the worship of God.\nNonetheless, this \u201cend-determination\u201d does not render\nLeibowitz\u2019s view teleological, since his view of faith, and\nindeed of divine worship does not \u201cposit an end separate from\nduty \u2026 [but rather] posits duty itself as an end\u201d (ibid,\n150). While the earlier discussion of Kierkegaardian paradox may have\nappeared counter to Leibowitz\u2019s scientific background, on this\noccasion his radical take on human autonomy does seem to lend itself\nmore naturally to an existentialist reading.\n\nThe flipside of this understanding of service of God in terms of\nradical human autonomy is that halakhah must be understood as\nexpressing a form of primordial divine heteronomy. This yields a\nfertile area of comparison to Levinas in Fagenblat 2004, though as\nFagenblat notes, for Levinas the realm of the ethical itself\nis a realm of transcendence beyond discursive human rationality.\nUnlike Leibowitz, for Levinas we need not go as far as mitzvoth to\nfind the realm of\n transcendence.[15]\n Either way, whether Leibowitz\u2019s views on the distinction\nbetween religion and ethics hold up depends in large part on 1)\nwhether one can indeed justify morality on rational or naturalistic\nfoundations, or whether it does in some way transcend human nature;\nand 2) the viability of his radicalized notion of freedom as the seat\nof ultimate\n value.[16]\n",
