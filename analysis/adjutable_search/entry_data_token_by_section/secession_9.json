    "main_text": "Secession and Just War Theory\n3. Secession and Just War Theory\n\n\nA more serious lacuna in the philosophical literature on secession\nthan the failure to integrate it into a comprehensive theory of\nterritorial justice is the absence of a connection with just war\ntheory. In real-world conflicts in which a group asserts the right to\nsecede and the state denies the validity of the claim, either one or\nboth of the parties often resorts to force. But merely establishing\nthat a group has the right to secede does not settle whether it is\njustified in using force to achieve its goal of independent statehood.\n(In general, merely having a right to X does not\nentail being justified in using force to secure X).\nSimilarly, if the group does not have the right to secede, it may still\nnot be justifiable for the state to use force to prevent it from\nseceding. Remarkably, philosophical theories of secession have not\ndistinguished between having the right to secede and being justified in\nusing force to exercise the right. Nor have they discussed the\nconditions under which states have the right to use force to resist\nsecessions when the secessionists have no moral right to secede. This\nis especially surprising, given the resurgence of philosophical\ntheorizing about just war.\n\n\nThe key point here is that mainstream just war theory does not\nendorse the assertion that the violation of any right can justify force\nnor the assertion that force is justified if it is required for the\nsuccessful exercise of any right. Instead, the dominant view is that\nthe list of just causes (legitimate ends to be served by going to war)\nis more constrained than that and should reflect the conviction that\nthe use of force is only justified if it is required to remedy very\nserious injustices or for the exercise of very important rights and\nalso satisfies a proportionality requirement.\n\n\nIt is far from obvious how just war theory and the theory of\nsecession should be connected. It appears, however, the use of force by\nsecessionists would be more problematic on some theories of secession\nthan on others. Suppose, for example, that a majority of the people in\na portion of a legitimate state\u2019s territory decide that they want\ntheir own state there, in spite of the fact that they are not victims\nof any injustices at the hands of the state. On the plebiscitary\ntheory, they have the right to secede (so long as the new unit and the\nremainder state will be able adequately to perform the basic functions\nof government). If the state refuses to vacate its facilities in that\nregion, turn over control over that portion of the border to the\nsecessionists, etc., is it justifiable for the secessionists to use\nforce against the agents of the state? Does the mere preference for\ntheir own state justify engaging in a course of action that is likely\nto result in large-scale violence? The problem here is that the purpose\nthe secessionists can invoke to justify a course of action seems not to\nfit well with the usual understandings of just cause. In contrast,\nremedial right only theories would seem to be consistent, at least in\nprinciple, with mainstream just war theory, because the latter\nrecognizes redress of serious injustices (and not the mere desire to\nhave one\u2019s own political unit) as a just cause.\n\n\nNonetheless, a fully-developed remedial right only theory would have\nto provide an account of when injustices are sufficiently serious to\nwarrant secession under conditions in which there is a significant risk\nof large-scale violence. Regardless of which type of theory one\nembraces, one would also need an account of the conditions under which\nthe state would be justified in using force to block secession. For as\nwe have already noted, the mere fact that the group attempting to\nsecede does not have a right to secede does not imply that it is\njustifiable for the state to use force to prevent them from seceding. A\nmoral theory of secession should not be limited, then, to articulating\nand defending characterization of the moral right to secede. It should\nalso provide an account of the morality of using force in conflicts\nover secession and one that is consistent with its view of the right to\nsecede.\n",
