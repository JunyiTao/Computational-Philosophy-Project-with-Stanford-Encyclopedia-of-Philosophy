    "main_text": "The Method in Meteorology: Deducing the Cause of the Rainbow\n7. The Method in Meteorology: Deducing the Cause of the Rainbow\n\nDescartes\u2019 deduction of the cause of the rainbow in\nMeteorology VIII has long been regarded as one of his\nclearest applications of the method (see Garber 2001: 85\u2013110).\nDescartes himself seems to have believed so too (see AT 1: 559, CSM 1:\n85). In Meteorology VIII, Descartes explicitly points out\nthat he could not have chosen \n\n\na more appropriate subject for demonstrating how, with the method I am\nusing, we can arrive at knowledge not possessed at all by those whose\nwritings are available to us. (AT 6: 325, MOGM: 332)\n\n\nDescartes begins his inquiry into the cause of the rainbow by\nenumerating2 all of the conditions relevant to the solution of the problem, beginning with when and where rainbows appear in nature.\nRainbows appear \n\n\nnot only in the sky, but also in the air near us, whenever there are\nmany drops of water in the air illuminated by the sun, as experience\nshows us in certain fountains. (AT 6: 325, MOGM: 332) \n\n\nThis observation yields a first conclusion: \n\n\n[Thus] it was easy for me to judge that [the rainbow] came merely from\nthe way that the rays of light act against those drops, and from there\ntoward our eyes. (AT 6: 325, CSM 1: 332) \n\n\nDrawing on his earlier description of the shape of water droplets in\nMeteorology V (AT 6: 279\u2013280, MOGM: 298\u2013299),\nDescartes reasons that \n\n\nknowing that these drops are round, as has been proven above, and\nseeing that their being larger or smaller does not change the\nappearance of the arc, I then took it into my head to make a very\nlarge one, the better to examine it. (AT 6: 280, MOGM: 332) \n\n\nHe designs a model that will enable him to acquire more\nobservations about of the behavior of light when it acts on water.\nSince water is perfectly round, and since the size of the water does\nnot change the appearance of the arc, he fills \u201ca perfectly\nround and transparent large flask with water\u201d and examines the\nbehavior of light when it acts on the water in the flask. Already at\nthis early stage, delicate considerations of relevance and irrelevance\nare clearly on display, and these considerations allow Descartes to\nnarrow down and more clearly define the problem.\nOnce he filled the large flask with water, he \n\n\ndiscovered that, for example, when the sun came from the section of\nthe sky marked AFZ, and my eye was at point E, then when I put this\nball in the location BCD, its part D appeared to me completely red and\nincomparably more brilliant than the rest [\u2026]. (AT 6:\n325\u2013326, MOGM: 332; see\n Fig. 3).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Descartes\u2019 flask model\nof sunlight acting on water droplets (MOGM: 333). [An\n extended description and SVG diagram of figure 3\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nAs Descartes surely knew from experience, red is the last color of the\nprimary rainbow (located in the uppermost section of the bow) and the\nfirst color of the secondary rainbow (located in the lowermost section\nof the bow). As he also must have known from experience, the red in\nthe primary rainbow is much brighter than the red in the secondary\nrainbow. Consequently, Descartes\u2019 observation that D appeared\ncompletely red and more brilliant than all other parts of the flask\nmust have immediately struck him as significant and promising. He\ntherefore proceeded to explore the relation between the rays of the\nsun, the position of his eyes, and the brightness of the red at D by\nvarying the conditions, observing what changes and what remains the\nsame in order to more precisely determine the relevant factors.\nThe brightness of the red at D is not affected by placing the flask to\nthe right or to the left of the observer, nor by the observer turning\nround the flask, so long as the angle DEM remains the same. When\nDescartes measures it, the angle DEM is 42\u00ba. Therefore, it is the\n42\u00ba angle the eye makes with D and M at DEM alone that plays a\nrole in the appearance of the brighter red at D. Having identified the\nmeasure of angle DEM, Descartes then varies the angle in order to\ndetermine what other changes, if any, occur. This enables him to\ncorrelate the decrease in the angle to the appearance of other colors\nin the flask: \n\n\nAnd if I made the angle slightly smaller, the color did not appear all\nat once, but rather it first divided into two less brilliant parts, in\nwhich one saw yellow, blue, and other colors \n\n\nof the primary rainbow (AT 6: 326\u2013327, MOGM: 333).\n\nDescartes then turns his attention toward point K in the flask, and\nobserves that \n\n\nif I made the angle KEM around 52\u00ba, this part K would appear red\ntoo, but not as brilliant as at D; and that if I made it slightly\nlarger, other weaker colors would appear. But I found that if I made\nit ever so slightly smaller, or very much larger, no colors would\nappear. (ibid.) \n\n\nOnce more, Descartes identifies the angle at which the less brilliant\nred appears, this time at K, closer to the top of the flask, and\nobserves that, by slightly enlarging the angle, other, weaker colors\nappear, as they do in the secondary rainbow. He concludes, based on\nthese observations, that if the air were filled with drops of water,\nthese drops would produce the same colors, relative to the same\nangles, effectively producing all the colors of the primary and\nsecondary rainbows.\n\nSo far, considerable progress has been made. The angles at which the\ncolors of the primary and secondary rainbows appear have been\ndetermined. We have acquired more precise information about when and\nwhere rainbows appear. However, we do not yet have an explanation. The\nunderlying cause of the rainbow remains unknown. Thus, Descartes\ndecides to examine \u201cin more detail what caused the part D of the\nball BCD to appear red\u201d, and finds that \n\n\nit was the rays of the sun which, coming from A toward B, were curved\n[refracted] as the entered the water at point B, and went toward C,\nwhence they were reflected toward D; and there, being curved\n[refracted] again as they left the water, they tended toward E. \n\n\nHow did Descartes arrive at this particular finding? By\nintervening directly in the model in order to exclude factors\nirrelevant to the production of the effect (the bright red at D) and\ncleanly isolate the cause that alone produces it. Whenever he\n\u201cput an opaque or dark body in some place on the lines AB, BC,\nCD, or DE, this red color would disappear\u201d, but whenever he\n\u201ccovered the whole ball except for the points B and D, and put\ndark bodies everywhere else\u201d, then the red color would appear at\nD. Similarly, in the case of K, he discovered that the ray that\nproduces the red color there comes from F toward G, where it is\nrefracted toward H, and thence reflected toward I, and at I once more\nreflected, this time toward K, where it is refracted toward E. He\nconcludes: \n\n\nTherefore the primary rainbow is caused by the rays which reach the\neye after two refractions and one reflection, and the secondary by\nother rays which reach it only after two refractions and two\nreflections; which is what prevents the second from appearing as\nclearly as the first. (AT 6: 328\u2013329, MOGM: 334) \n\n\n(As we will see below, another experiment Descartes conducts reveals\nthat this conclusion is false, and that only one refraction is needed\nto produce the colors of the rainbow. It is interesting that Descartes\nwould choose to include a result he will later overturn.)\n\nDescartes next examines what he describes as the \u201cprincipal\ndifficulty\u201d. Suppose a ray strikes the flask somewhere between K\nand B, undergoes two refractions and one or two reflections, and upon\nleaving the flask tends toward the eye at E. Why this ray produces no\ncolor, and \u201conly those of which I have spoken [\u2026] cause\ncertain colors to appear\u201d, is not clear (AT 6: 329, MOGM: 334).\nThe difficulty here is twofold. First, why is it that only the rays\nDescartes has identified produce colors? Second, why do these rays\nproduce \u201ccertain colors\u201d, i.e.., these colors in this\nparticular order (see Buchwald 2008: 10)? To resolve this difficulty,\nDescartes \n\n\nlooked to see if there were some other subject where they [the\ncolors] appeared in the same way, so that by comparing them with each\nother I could better judge their cause. (AT 6: 329, MOGM: 335) \n\n\nThe principal function of the comparison is to determine whether the factors\nthat produce the colors of the rainbow in water can be found in other\nmedia. Descartes decides to examine the production of these colors in\na prism (see\n Fig. 4).\n Prisms are differently shaped than water, produce the colors of the\nrainbow without any reflections, and with only one refraction. These\nconditions are rather different than the conditions in which the\ncolors of the rainbow are produced in a flask. Clearly, then, the true\ncause of the rainbow has not yet been fully determined.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Descartes\u2019 prism model\n(AT 6: 330, MOGM: 335, D1637: 255). [An\n extended description and SVG diagram of figure 4\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nIn the prism model, the rays emanating from the sun at ABC \u201ccross MN at\nright angles, or nearly so, so that they do not undergo any noticeable\nrefraction there\u201d, but \u201csuffer a fairly great refraction\nin coming out through NP\u201d (AT 6: 329\u2013330, MOGM: 335).\nFurthermore, it is only when the two sides of the bottom of the prism\nNP are covered by a dark body of some sort, so that the rays could\nonly exit through the narrow opening at DE, that the rays paint all\nthe colors of the rainbow on the cloth or white paper FGH, always\nproducing red at F, and blue or violet at H (ibid.). By comparing\ndifferences between the flask and the prism, Descartes learns\n\u201cthat the surfaces of the drops of water need not be curved in\norder to produce these colors, for those of this crystal are\ncompletely flat\u201d. He also learns that \u201cthe angle under\nwhich they appear need not be any particular size, for it can be\nchanged here without their changing\u201d (ibid.). Here, Descartes is\nreferring to the angle of refraction (e.g., HEP), which can vary\nbetween the flask and the prism and yet produce the same effect, and\nwhich can also be the same for rays ABC in the prism at DE and yet\nproduce different colors at FGH. He further learns that \n\n\nneither is reflection necessary, for there is none of it here; nor\nfinally do we need a plurality of refractions, for there is only one\nof them here. (ibid.) \n\n\nHe also \u201chad no doubt that light was necessary, for without it\nwe would see nothing\u201d (AT 6: 331, MOGM: 335). Finally, he \n\n\nobserved [\u2026] that shadow, or the limitation of this light, was\nnecessary; for if we remove the dark body on NP, the colors FGH cease\nto appear, and if we make the opening DE large enough, the red,\norange, and yellow at F extend no further because of that than do the\ngreen, blue, and violet at H\u2014instead, all the extra space\nbetween the two at G remains white. (AT 6: 331, MOGM: 336) \n\n\nWhen the dark body covering two parts of the base of the prism is\ncompletely removed, no colors appear at all at FGH, and if it is\nopened too widely, all of the colors retreat to F and H, and no colors\nappear in between (see Buchwald 2008: 14).\n\nDescartes has so far compared the production of the rainbow in two\ndistinct models: the flask and the prism. In both cases, he enumerates\nvariations and invariances in the production of one and the same\neffect, excludes irrelevant causes, and pinpoints only those that are\nnecessary. Interestingly, the second experiment in particular also\nraises new problems, problems Descartes could not have been\nfamiliar with prior to the experiment, but which do enable him to more\nconcretely define the series of problems he needs to solve in order to\ndetermine the cause of the rainbow (see Garber 2001: 101\u2013104 and\nBuchwald 2008). For example, the colors produced at F and H (see\n Fig. 6\n below) are different, \u201ceven though the refraction, shadow, and\nlight concur there in the same way\u201d (AT 6: 331, MOGM: 336). What\ncauses these colors to differ?\n\nTo solve this problem, Descartes draws\non his previous research in Optics and reflects on the nature\nof the particles whose motions at the micro-mechanical level, beyond\nwhat can be observed by the senses, produce visible light. Descartes\u2019 method\nrequires that every phenomenon in nature be reducible to the material\nsimple natures of extension, shape, and motion (see\n Section 2.2.1\n above). What remains to be determined in this case is \u201cwhat\nsort of mixture of simple natures is necessary for producing all the\neffects\u201d of the rainbow (AT 10: 427, CSM 1: 49), i.e., how the\nextension, shape, and motion of the particles of light produce the\nprecise order of the colors of the rainbow. The transition from the\nprism to the micro-mechanical level is naturally prompted by the fact\nthat neither the flask nor the prism can be of any assistance in\nfinding the cause of the order of the colors of the rainbow. The prism\nonly provides conditions in which \u201cthe refraction, shadow, and\nlight concur in the same way\u201d and yet produce different colors\nin different places on FGH. The cause of the color order cannot be\ndisclosed by the mere examination of the models.\n\nIn Optics, Descartes described the nature of light as \n\n\nthe action or movement of a certain very fine material whose particles\nmust be pictured as small balls rolling in the pores of earthly bodies\n(AT 6: 331, MOGM: 336) \n\n\nThe manner in which these balls tend to rotate depends on the causes\nthat determine them to do so. When they are refracted by a common\nsurface, \u201call the refractions which occur on the same side [of\nthe balls] cause them to turn in the same direction\u201d (ibid.),\nbut they do not necessarily have the same tendency to rotational\nspeed. Particles of light can acquire different tendencies to\nrotational speed after refraction, depending on the bodies that\nsurround them, \n\n\nso that those which have a much stronger tendency to rotate cause the\ncolor red, and those which have only a slightly stronger tendency\ncause yellow, \n\n\nwhile \n\n\nthe nature of those that are visible at H consists only in the fact\nthat these small particles do not rotate as quickly as they usually do\n[\u2026] so that green appears when they turn just a little more\nslowly, and blue where they turn very much more slowly. (ibid.) \n\n\nThe balls that compose the ray EH have a weaker tendency to rotate,\nwhile those that compose the ray DF have a stronger one. Differences\nin color are therefore produced by differential tendencies to\nrotational speed after refraction. This is a characteristic example of\nhow mechanical explanation in Cartesian natural philosophy operates.\nThe description of the behavior of particles at the micro-mechanical\nlevel explain the observable effects of the relevant phenomenon.\n\nThe rays coming toward the eye at E are clustered at definite angles\nin the flask, and these angles determine which rays reach our eyes and\nwhich rays do not (see\n Fig. 5).\n\n\n\nFigure 5 (AT 6: 328, D1637: 251). [An\n extended description and SVG diagram of figure 5\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nAt DEM, which has an angle of 42\u00ba, the red of the primary rainbow\nappears, and below it, at slightly smaller angles, appear the\nremaining colors of the primary rainbow (orange, yellow, green, blue,\nviolet). At KEM, which has an angle of about 52\u00ba, the fainter red\nof the secondary rainbow appears, and above it, at slightly larger\nangles, appear the remaining colors of the secondary rainbow (orange,\nyellow, green, blue, violet). The neighborhood of the two principal\nangles DEM and KEM alone receive a sufficient number of rays to\nproduce all the colors of the primary and secondary rainbows. Beyond\nthem, there lies only \u201cshadow\u201d, i.e., light rays that, due\nto their small number, produce no color. The conditions under which\ncolors are produced in the prism do indeed faithfully reproduce those\nin which the colors of the rainbow are naturally produced, and\ntogether the flask, the prism, and Descartes\u2019 physics of light\ndeduce all of the effects of the rainbow.\n\nThe structure of the deduction is exhibited in\n Figure 6.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Descartes\u2019 deduction of\nthe rainbow (Garber 2001: 100).
