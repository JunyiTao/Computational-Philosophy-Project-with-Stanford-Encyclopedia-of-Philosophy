Ontology and Metaphysics\n\nOnly an ontological pluralism does justice to the richness of\nthe world.\n(Rickert 1932, 100)\n\n\n\nFrom roughly the beginning of the 1920s Rickert\u2019s philosophy\nis characterized by what has been referred to as an \u201contological\nturn\u201d (Farges 2010, 26; Kuttig 1987). However, in Rickert\u2019s\neyes the introduction of ontology is not a departure from his earlier\nepistemological focus or the leap into a completely new philosophical\ndimension. As his definition of ontology as \u201cthe doctrine of what\nis predicated as being\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 54) already suggests,\nontological questions are deeply connected to questions about judgment\nand predication. In other words, if we take our knowledge to consist of\njudgments and if we take our judgments to consist of a formal and a\nmaterial component, then it is legitimate to ask what is the\nmaterial component cast into conceptual forms in judgments. As the\nopening quote of this section indicates, for Rickert it is important to\nuphold pluralism in ontology. In keeping with the pluralism of\nmeaningful predication (there is a plurality of things that we can\nmeaningfully articulate judgments about), we cannot dogmatically\npresuppose that there is only one meaning of the\n\u2018being\u2019 addressed in our predicative activities. In this\nregard, far from being detrimental to a genuine ontological\ninvestigation, Rickert\u2019s insistence on the preeminence of\nepistemology turns out to have a positive effect on ontology. If the\ncompass to orient ourselves in ontology is meaningful predication, then\nwe are from the beginning immune to dogmatic reductions of what\nis to one monistically conceived dimension of reality (Rickert\n1934b, 57).\n\n\nRickert\u2019s ontology contemplates four \u201ckinds of being\n(Seinsarten) of the world\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 153): (1)\nsensible (sinnlich) being; (2) non-sensible\n(unsinnlich) being; (3) pro-physical (pro-physisches)\nbeing; (4) supersensible (\u00fcbersinnlich) being.\n\n\n(1) Sensible being is the ontological category under which\nfall both physical and psychological being, that is, material things\nand mental states. Both the sphere of the physical and the sphere of\nthe psychological are directly accessible to experience (Rickert 1934b,\n63\u201364) and can be the object of meaningful predication. Therefore they\nmust be granted equal ontological worth. Psychophysical dualism,\nhowever, causes the classical problems of mind-body causal interaction\nversus mind-body parallelism. Rickert\u2019s sympathies are clearly\nwith the idea of psychophysical causality (both body to mind and mind\nto body) versus the hypothesis of psychophysical parallelism and the\nensuing panpsychism (Rickert 1900). He considers psychophysical\nparallelism a self-undermining hypothesis to the extent that it relies\non the atomization and quantification of psyche. Defenders of\npsychophysical parallelism (such as Baruch Spinoza and Gustav Fechner)\nintroduced this hypothesis in order to preserve the autonomy of the\npsyche as the domain of the qualitative, which they take to be\nessentially different from merely quantitative physical being. However,\nin order to articulate their model they have to rely on a\nquantification of the psyche, which undercuts precisely the premise,\nbased on which psychophysical parallelism was considered a good\nalternative to psychophysical causality to begin with (Rickert 1900,\n76; Rickert 1934b, 66\u201373). The reason why the idea of a two-way causal\nlink between mental and physical being seems to pose an impossible\npuzzle is that, prima facie, the order of the psychic and the\norder of the physical strike us as belonging to two separate\nontological domains. However, for Rickert this is because we generally\noverlook the tertium comparationis, which proves that they\nactually belong in one an the same ontological dimension, namely, that\nthey are both domains of sensible being, i.e., being that is\ndirectly accessible to perception. From this perspective causal\ninteraction between mind and body is nothing but causal interaction\nbetween two ontologically homogeneous species of one and the same\nontological genus \u2018sensible being\u2019. To be sure, the\nphysical and the psychic display vastly different characteristics\n(extension vs. unextendedness; intentionality vs. lack of\nintentionality; spatiotemporal individuation vs. temporal\nindividuation.) However, for Rickert this is not enough reason to\nconsider the two dimensions as ontologically heterogeneous. If they are\nontologically homogeneous, then it is the task of specialized empirical\nresearch and not of philosophy to determine their causal relations.\n\n\n(2) The ontological homogeneity of the physical and the\npsychic becomes even more clear if we turn our attention to a\ncompletely different ontological sphere, which taken together\nheterologically with sensible being completes the concept of the world\nof experience (Erfahrungswelt). The second kind of being in\nRickert\u2019s ontology is what he calls non-sensible being.\nIn order to introduce non-sensible being Rickert recommends that we\nturn our attention to word-meanings (Rickert 1934b, 79). While having a\nconversation, we do not only perceive the physical body of our\ninterlocutor and the psychic reality attached to it. We also\n\u2018receive\u2019 in the same direct, immediate way the meanings of\nthe words that he or she is uttering. These meanings are not psychic\nrealities. They do not coincide with the thoughts of the speaker or\nwith the acoustic stimuli of the listener. The very same meanings could\nbe conveyed by a completely different sensible \u2018support\u2019\nsuch as ink scribbles on paper. We can even recognize the same meaning\nas being instantiated by different words in different languages, such\nas the identical meaning of \u2018red\u2019, \u2018rot\u2019,\n\u2018rosso\u2019 and \u2018rouge\u2019. While the meaning of words\nmust be carried by some sensible support, it is itself not\nsensible. It is not sensed or perceived but rather understood.\nThis is why Rickert proposes to call the second ontological domain the\nnon-sensible sphere of understandable meaning-configurations\n(verstehbare Sinngebilde) (Rickert 1934b, 81). Word-meanings,\nhowever, are only a tiny fraction of the meaning-configurations that we\ncan experience. The arrangement of the musical notes in a symphony is\nlikewise understood as a meaning-configuration possibly carried by\ndifferent sensible supports\u2014the same melody can be played in a\ndifferent key, with a different instrument, it can be sung, etc.\nLooking at the works of a great artist we can understand one and the\nsame non-sensible meaning-configuration (say, the same\n\u2018style\u2019) realized sensibly in different media. The universe\nof meaning-configurations constitutes for Rickert an authentic\nmundus intelligibilis experienced in concomitance with but as\ndifferent from the mundus sensibilis of perceivable being.\nHowever, he takes pains to remind us that we should not repeat the old\nPlatonic mistake of taking the world of non-sensible being to be a\nmetaphysically separate reality. Understandable meaning-configurations\nare an ingredient of our everyday experience and so they have to be\ncounted among the ontological ingredients of the experiential world. In\nexploring the world of meaning-configurations we must take into account\nthe principles that allow for meaning-configurations to be\nintelligible. Not every string of words is intelligible and, most\nimportantly, not every intelligible string of words is true. The same\nholds for every meaning-configuration. It is intelligible only if its\nconstitutive non-sensible elements are held together by the reference\nto a specific value. True sentences, for instance, are unified\nby their reference to the theoretical value of truth. In this way,\nRickert clarifies the ontological status of values as non-sensible\nbeings. The real dualism pertaining to the world of experience, then,\nis not the one between body and mind but the one between the sensible\nworld of perceivable entities and the non-sensible world of\nunderstandable meaning-configurations (Rickert 1934b, 92\u201397). This\ninsight defeats a view Rickert calls \u201chyletic sensualism\u201d\n(Rickert 1934b, 93) that he attributes to both Kant and Husserl.\nHyletic sensualists assume that the content of our experience\ncan only be sensible, and that whatever is non-sensible and\nintelligible must be ascribed to the form of our experience\ninstead. However, based on the above analyses, Rickert emphasizes that\nthe very content of our experience is both sensible\n(perceivable) and non-sensible (intelligible). Accordingly, in\norder to generate knowledge of sensible entities and intelligible\nmeaning-configurations the conceptual forms of our cognition must apply\nto both domains.\n\n\n(3) Upon closer scrutiny, the kind of content that we\nencounter in the world of experience and conceptualize in the empirical\nsciences shows itself to be a compound of form and\ncontent. In fact, the entities that we encounter and theorize\nabout in the world of experience are always objects, in a\nbroad sense comprising physical, psychic and non-sensible entities\n(meaning-configurations). In keeping with the Kantian tradition,\nhowever, objects are the result of synthetic processes of\nobjectification guided by some categories (forms). It is\ntherefore possible to raise a question about a third domain of being:\nhow are we to think the pure content or hyle that is\nimmediately experienced prior to all objectification and\ncategorization? At first this universe of absolutely raw and\nunsynthesized content has to be conceived of as prior to the\ndistinction between sensible and non-sensible being, and, within the\nsphere of sensible being, prior to the distinction between physical and\npsychic reality. This is why Rickert suggests to call this third domain\nof being the \u201cpro-physical world\u201d (Rickert 1934b,\n111; Rickert 1921b, 296), using improperly the term\n\u2018physical\u2019 in the phrase to indicate the whole domain of\nthe experiential world. In this sense, \u201cthe problem of prophysics\n[is] at the same time the problem of the immediate\u201d (Rickert\n1934b, 112), that is of the pure, immediately lived content preceding\nall synthesis and categorization. The regression to the prophysical\nworld, however, does not leave us with a completely undifferentiated\nand inchoate mass of raw \u2018content\u2019. If we think of objects\nas the products of a subject\u2019s activity of categorial formation,\nthen suspending all categorial syntheses leads us back to a\npre-objective subject (Rickert 1934b, 115), whose synthetic\nactivity brings about objects out of the pure pro-physical material in\nthe first place. One might be inclined to think that the pro-physical\nsubject coincides with Kant\u2019s transcendental apperception, that\nis, a mere empty \u2018form\u2019 of subjectivity or consciousness in\ngeneral. However, and in keeping with the analyses of subjectivity in\nThe Object of Knowledge (see above), in order to be\nresponsible for the processes of objectification and thus form\nprimordial materials into proper objects, the pro-physical subject must\nbe conceived of as active and capable of stance-takings toward\nvalues (Rickert 1934b, 118). In other words, the pro-physical subject\nthat we necessarily have to think as prior to all psychic, physical and\nmeaning-related objectifications must be conceived of as free\n(Rickert 1934b, 120). While empirical psychology operating in the\nsphere of already objectified sensible being presents us with empirical\nsubjects who are causally determined in various ways, pro-physics\nunearths a transcendental dimension of freedom that is presupposed by\nall objectifications. Rickert suggests that this insight solves the\n\u201cmystery\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 123) of freedom by way of\ndissolving, as it were, the traditional antinomy between freedom and\ndeterminism. These two notions, in Rickert\u2019s view, belong in two\ndistinct ontological spheres. While the objectified psychic subject is\nindeed causally determined as much as any other bit of sensible being,\nthe pro-physical subject responsible for each objectification is\ninherently free. In this sense, freedom and determinism are not\nopposed. To the extent that determinism presupposed the process of\nobjectification, (psychophysical) determinism presupposes\n(prophysical) freedom. After establishing the ontological features of\nthe prophysical subject, we can turn to the primordial materials or\ncontents that the prophysical subject forms. Rickert suggests to calls\nthe branch of prophysics dealing with pure materials\nZustandslehre, an expression hardly translatable into English\nwithout losing its intended assonance with Gegenstandslehre\n(Rickert 1934b, 127). Gegen-stand is the German term for\nobject, that is, literally, that which stands over and against a\nsubject. However, if Gegend-stand is the product of an\nobjectifying process, then Rickert suggests that we call that which is\nthereby objectified and placed \u2018over and against\u2019\nZu-stand, which can be roughly translated as\n\u2018state\u2019. A doctrine of pure states (reine\nZust\u00e4nde) is meant to investigate the pre-objectified, pure\ncontent independently of the categorial forms that pervade such content\nin our sensible experiences of fully formed objects (Rickert 1934b,\n129). The gist of Rickert\u2019s Zustandslehre is that even\nin the pro-physical world we have no reason to think of content in a\nmonistic fashion. \u201cIn the Zustandslehre we can exhibit\nthe ultimate ground for the encompassing dualism of the world of\nobjects. Already the dimension of pure states (das\nZust\u00e4ndliche) pertaining to understandable objects, that is,\nits bare material, is as non-sensible as the form which creates\nnon-sensible objects out of it. The understandable\nmeaning-configuration has both a non-sensible form and a non-sensible\ncontent\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 131). In other words, Rickert wants to\nsay that the understandable meaning-configurations considered in the\nsecond domain of ontology are non-sensible through and\nthrough. One might be tempted to think that a word-meaning is\ncomposed of a non-sensible form (the ideal Bedeutung) and a\nsensible content, say, the acoustic data forming the distinctive sound\nof the word \u2018red\u2019 in English or those forming the\ndistinctive sound of the word \u2018rosso\u2019 in Italian. On\nRickert\u2019s account, however, this would be wrong. We have to\ndistinguish the acoustic carrier of the word-meaning from the\nword-meaning as a whole, in both its form and its\ncontent. The acoustic carrier is entirely sensible and the word-meaning\nitself is entirely non-sensible. The conclusion of Rickert\u2019s\nprophysics is that if we consider its domain as that of the\n\u201cuniversal minimum\u201d of thinkability (Rickert 1934b, 133),\nthen we have to concede that such universal minimum already entails\na plurality of factors, namely, the minimal distinction\nbetween I (the prophysical subject) and non-I (the domain of pure\nstates) and the further distinction within the sphere of non-I between\nthe pro-physical sensible and the pro-physical non-sensible, whose\nobjectifications carried out by the free pro-physical subject give rise\nto the objects in the world of experience.\n\n\n(4) The fourth and last ontological domain Rickert considers\nis that of supersensible being, traditionally addressed by\nmetaphysics. Rickert\u2019s approach to metaphysics is guided by the\nproblem of the ultimate connection between reality and value. Both the\nanalysis of the world of experience and the analysis of the prophysical\nworld resulted in an inevitable dualism between the sensible and the\nnon-sensible, viz., the perceivable and the understandable. This poses\nthe problem of how to preserve the dualism and still be able to\nconceive of the world as a whole in a unitary fashion. The first clue\nto think about the unity of the world is provided by the doctrine of\nthe prophysical subject: \u201cIt produces a connection of what is\nreal and what is meaningful (das Sinnhafte) and at the same\ntime with the valid value\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 135). With its free\nstance-takings relating (sensible and non-sensible) materials to\n(non-sensible) values the prophysical subject encompasses both terms of\nthe dualism and thus provides a criterion to conceive of them as\nunited. However, this seems to tie the unity of reality and value to\nthe particularity and contingency of actual stance-takings. This unity\nseems to be extremely precarious and ultimately grounded in the\narbitrary acts of a pro-physical subject. The thought of a unity of\nreality and value beyond the particular acts of valuing\nsubjectivity and thus beyond the scope of contents of consciousness\nopens up the intellectual space of metaphysics. Rickert is adamant that\nultimately the transcendent unity of reality and value beyond\nsubjectivity is the object of \u201cfaith\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 137)\nand not scientific knowledge. However, he insists that we need such\nfaith in order to live both as practical and as theoretical human\nbeings. \u201cIf the world were not arranged in such a way that our\nstance-taking toward the value of truth \u2018succeeds\u2019 beyond\nthe I\u2019s act, then science, which pushes forward to cognize the\nworld, is impossible. As scientific people, too, we need the assumption\nthat there is a more than particular, \u2018cosmic\u2019 connection\nof value and reality\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 138). The\n\u201csupersensible unity\u201d of value and reality\n(Wirklichkeit) or the domain of \u201cvalue-reality\u201d\n(Wertrealit\u00e4t) (Rickert 1934b, 139) is the object of\nmetaphysics. Describing the mode of access to the domain of\nvalue-reality in metaphysics, Rickert holds fast to Kant\u2019s view\nthat metaphysics is not possible as a science. This, however,\nentails neither that metaphysics is altogether impossible, nor\nthat some other kind of non-scientific knowledge may not be produced as\nlegitimate metaphysical knowledge. Rickert refers to metaphysical\nknowledge in scare quotes as \u201callegoric\u201d,\n\u201cimage-building\u201d (sinnbildlich) or\n\u201csymbolic\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 140). In other words,\nmetaphysics is bound to employ images, metaphors and oblique\nexpressions in order to produce indirect knowledge of the transcendent,\nsubject-independent unity of reality and value. Rickert here clearly\nhas in mind the most illustrious of all metaphysicians: Plato. When he\ncalled the Forms \u2018real\u2019 he borrowed a phrase that has an\nestablished meaning for this-worldly realities and applied it\nmetaphorically to the domain of otherworldly or supersensible being.\nMoreover, as is well known, he made abundant use of allegories, similes\nand mythological stories in order to illustrate the ultimately\ninaccessible world of the supersensible. Finally, Rickert warns against\na conflation of metaphysics and religion (Rickert 1934, 201). While in\nconcrete cultural worlds and living individuals these two spheres of\nculture often intersect and overlap, it is important to keep them\nconceptually distinct. Metaphysics is a theoretical enterprise trying\nto determine conceptually supersensible being with the aid of\nmetaphors, symbols, etc. It does involve faith but it is a purely\nrational faith in some kind of transcendent unity of reality\nand value. Religion, on the contrary, is characterized by faith in the\nexistence of a supersensible divine being, in which ultimately all\nvalues and meanings are grounded. Both are valuable and important\ncomponent of culture. Empirically speaking, they often occur together\nand have numerous mutual influences. However, they can never be reduced\ntheoretically to one another. In other words, the rational\nfaith of metaphysics does not automatically lead to religious faith in\na divine being and, conversely, religious faith does not necessitate\nthe believer to accept that the ultimate unity of reality and value is\naccessible (through symbolic knowledge) to the rational discourse of\nmetaphysics.\n",
