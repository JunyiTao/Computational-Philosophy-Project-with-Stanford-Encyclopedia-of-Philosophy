Audience-dependence entails that\nsignalers tailor their context-sensitive facial displays to their\naudience and do not produce them mandatorily upon experiencing a given\nemotion. Displays are rather \n\n\ndeclarations that signify our trajectory in a given social\ninteraction, that is, what we will do in the current situation, or\nwhat we would like the other to do. (Fridlund 1994: 130)\n\n\nFor example, what Ekman would describe as an anger face, a sad face or\na happy face is described by behavioral ecologists as, respectively, a\ndisplay of readiness to attack, a display of intent to affiliate and a\ndisplay of recruitment of succor (Fridlund 1994). A number of\ntheorists have argued that Ekman\u2019s and Fridlund\u2019s\napproaches can be reconciled: emotions can at the same time express\nemotions and make declarations that are credible precisely because\nthey are associated with emotions (M. Green 2007; Scarantino 2017;\nHess, Banse, & Kappas 1995; see also Bar-On 2013).\n\nThe broader problem with traditional BET is that the distinctive\nresponse profiles allegedly produced in cascade-like fashion have not\nbeen convincingly demonstrated either at the level of expressive\nresponses or at the level of autonomic changes, neural changes, preset\nactions or learned actions (Ortony & Turner 1990; Mauss et al.\n2005; Barrett 2006; Lindquist et al. 2012). This lack of clear and\ndistinctive bodily signatures has led to a variety of attempts to save\nBET from empirical refutation. Some basic emotion theorists have\nsuggested, for instance, that basic emotions can be regulated, which\nwould mask their mandatory effects, or that they cannot be elicited at\nthe right level of intensity by laboratory stimuli, or that they often\nmix with other affective and cognitive states in ways that blur their\ndistinctive responses (Ekman & Cordaro 2011).\n\nOthers have offered new meta-analyses that are more favorable to the\nexistence of emotion-specific biological signatures, especially at the\nlevel of autonomic and neural changes (Kreibig 2010; Stephens et al.\n2010; Nummenmaa & Saarim\u00e4ki forthcoming). A third option is\nto transition to a New Basic Emotion Theory which replaces the\nassumption of cascade-like responses with that of action tendencies\nwith control precedence, which would account for some of the\nvariability of responses while preserving the core idea that basic\nemotions are geared towards solving evolutionary problems (Levenson\n2011; Scarantino & Griffiths 2011; Scarantino 2015).\n\nA more radical proposal has been offered by psychological\nconstructionists, who have suggested that we should abandon entirely\nthe \u201clatent variable\u201d model distinctive of basic emotion\ntheory, replacing it with an \u201cemergent variable\u201d model\naccording to which emotions do not cause facial expressions, autonomic\nchanges and preset and learned actions but rather emerge from them\n(Barrett & Russell 2015). Specifically, psychological\nconstructionists have argued that there is no one-to-one\ncorrespondence between anger, fear, happiness, sadness, etc. and any\nneurobiological, physiological, expressive, behavioral, or\nphenomenological responses, and that the different responses allegedly\ndiagnostic of basic emotions are not even strongly correlated with one\nanother.\n\nPsychological constructionists have concluded that this variability\ncalls into question the very idea that \n\n\nemotions have ontological status as causal entities [and that they]\nexist in the brain or body and cause changes in sensory, perceptual,\nmotor, and physiological outputs. (Barrett 2005: 257) \n\n\nThis view is at the polar opposite of the Motivational Tradition,\nwhich takes emotions to be motives\u2014causal determinants of the\nchanges in outputs we observe.\n\nIt has also been suggested that the folk psychological categories\ncommonly invoked by basic emotion theorists\u2014e.g., anger, fear,\ndisgust, etc.\u2014are not suitable objects of scientific\ninvestigation, and should be replaced by categories that describe\nemotion components rather than discrete emotions themselves (Russell\n2003; Barrett 2006, 2017).\n\nConstructionists are convinced that emotions are put together on the\nfly and in flexible ways using building blocks that are not specific\nto emotions, roughly in the way cooked foods are constructed from\ningredients that are not specific to them and could be used according\nto alternative recipes. One of the ingredients out of which emotions\nare built is said to be core affect, which is a \n\n\nneurophysiological state that is consciously accessible as a simple,\nnonreflective feeling that is an integral blend of hedonic\n(pleasure\u2013displeasure) and arousal (sleepy\u2013activated)\nvalues. (Russell 2003: 147)\n\n\nPsychological constructionists emphasize that we are always in some\nstate of core affect, which is a sort of barometer that informs us of\nour \u201crelationship\u201d to the flow of events. The readings of\nthe barometer are feelings, understood as blends of\npleasure-displeasure and activation-deactivation. These readings can\nbe represented as points along a \u201ccircumplex structure\u201d, with the vertical axis representing the degree of activation-deactivation and the horizontal axis representing the degree of pleasure-displeasure\n(Russell 1980):\n\n\n\n\nDifferent constructionists describe the way in which emotions are\nbuilt out of core affect and other ingredients in different ways. For\nexample, in Barrett\u2019s influential Conceptual Act View,\nconceptualization plays a key role (Barrett 2006, 2013, 2017; Barrett\n& Satpute 2013). Being afraid amounts to categorizing a core\naffective state of high arousal and high displeasure under the\n\u201cfear\u201d concept. Being happy amounts to categorizing a core\naffective state of high arousal and high pleasure under the\n\u201chappiness\u201d concept. More generally, Barrett (2017) takes\nemotions to be experiences that emerge from the categorization of\nsensations from one\u2019s own body and the world. This view, which\nresembles Schachter and Singer\u2019s (1962) cognition-arousal theory\nand merges themes from the Feeling Tradition and the Evaluative\nTradition, has been criticized for conflating emotions with verbal\nlabeling, for making it impossible for adult humans to mislabel their\nown emotions, and for preventing infants and animals from having\nemotions in the first place (e.g., Scherer 2009, see Barrett 2015 for\na reply).\n\nRussell (2003) considers conceptualization to affect only the\nmeta-experience of emotion, i.e., the realization that one is\nafraid, and allows emotion episodes to be constructed without the\ninvolvement of categorization. On his view, there are a variety of\nindependent causal mechanisms, rather than any emotion-specific\nmechanism, that explain why there is some degree of correlation\nbetween expressive, autonomic and behavioral changes in emotional\nepisodes, even though it is emphasized that the correlations are much\nweaker than what Ekman\u2019s (1999a) model would predict (Russell\n2012).\n\nIn recent times, some proposals have been made to integrate\npsychological constructionism with other research programs. Some have\nsuggested that progress lies in merging appraisal theory with\nRussell\u2019s version of psychological constructionism and have\noffered a general theory of how emotional action tendencies are caused\nby the weighing of the expected utilities of action options (Moors\n2017). Others have proposed that we sharply distinguish between the\nphenomenological and the motivational side of affective phenomena,\nhanding out the motivational side of (some) basic emotions to a new\ntheory of survival circuits and reserving folk psychological emotion\nterms to designate feelings exclusively, with the latter understood as\ncognitively constructed (LeDoux 2015, 2017; note the contrast with\nLeDoux 1996). \n\nAnother option with some elements of overlap with psychological\nconstructionism is social constructionism. The social constructionist\napproach found its first advocates in the 1920\u2019s when a number\nof anthropologists and social scientists started questioning\nDarwin\u2019s (1872) evidence for the universality of emotional\nexpressions (e.g., Allport 1924; Landis 1924; Klineberg 1940).\n\nThese researchers initiated what we may call the \u201ccultural\nvariability\u201d strand of social constructionism, related to the\nthesis that emotions are different in several essential respects in\ndifferent cultures. These differences have since been shown with\nrespect to both the emotion lexicon (e.g., Russell 1991; Wierzbicka\n1999) and the diagnostic characteristics of emotions (e.g., Mesquita\n& Frijda 1992; Mesquita & Parkinson forthcoming).\n\nThe strand of social constructionism that is more germane to the\nMotivational Tradition is the \u201csocial role\u201d strand,\nrelated to the thesis that emotions fulfill social functions by virtue\nof which they should be considered actions or roles rather than\npassions (see, e.g., Solomon 1976 and Averill 1990 on the \u201cmyth\nof passions\u201d). Jean Paul Sartre (1939 [1948]) can be considered\nthe first to offer a general, although idiosyncratic, theory of\nemotions as social roles, a view developed in the early 1980s by\nphilosophers (e.g., Harr\u00e9 1986, Armon-Jones 1986),\npsychologists (e.g., Averill 1980), and anthropologists (e.g., Lutz\n1988). In recent times, Parkinson (1995, 2008, 2009), Parkinson,\nFischer, and Manstead (2005), Griffiths (2004), Mesquita and Boiger\n(2014) and Van Kleef (2016) have articulated sophisticated social\nconstructionist accounts that add to the social constructionist\ntradition themes from evolutionary accounts. \n",
