Returning to the Everyday Lifeworld: Not One\n\nIf we are to stop at sketching what Zen-seeing is together with its\nunderstanding of time and space as an integrated space-time, there is\nthe danger of fixing the stance thus \u201cobtained.\u201d (Although\nwe must keep in mind that Zen \u201cobtains\u201d the stance of\n\u201cnot two\u201d in such a way that it cannot be obtained, for in\nthe non-dualistic dimension nothing can be \u201cobtained.\u201d)\nZen recognizes at the same time that any stance that is fixed is\none-sided and partial.  It will deprive Zen, for example, of an\nopportunity to utilize Zen-seeing in the actions of everyday life. For\nthis reason, Zen insists that the practitioner move to the stance of\n\u201cnot one.\u201d What then is Zen\u2019s stance of \u201cnot\none\u201d?  This question affords the reader, for the purpose of the\npresent article, to get a glimpse into Zen\u2019s movement from\n\u201cnot two\u201d to \u201cnot one,\u201d although in actuality\nthis movement operates in a dynamic bilateral movement between\nthem. This movement is symbolized in Zen by a circle, an image of the\nwhole, which is also an image of perfection. Insofar as\n\u201cone\u201d is a negation of \u201cnot two,\u201d \u201cnot\none\u201d then brings the Zen practitioner back to the everyday\nlifeworld, the world of multiplicity that is ordinarily constructed\nego-logically and dualistically. \n",
