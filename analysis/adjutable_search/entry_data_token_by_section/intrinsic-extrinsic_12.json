    "main_text": "Attempts at Analysis || Non-Disjunctivity Theories\n3.3 Non-Disjunctivity Theories\n\nInstead of analysing intrinsicality in terms of perfect naturalness,\none might try to analyse it in terms of non-disjunctivity, where\nnon-disjunctivity is regarded as an objective metaphysical feature of\nproperties rather than merely a syntactical feature of predicates. The\nmost prominent attempt to do this is the account of Langton and Lewis\n1998. (A similar theory is in an appendix to Zimmerman 1997.)\n\nLangton and Lewis\u2019s account involves the following three steps.\nFirst, they analyse the non-disjunctive properties as follows:\n\n[T]he disjunctive properties [are] those properties that can\nbe expressed by a disjunction of (conjunctions of) natural properties;\nbut that are not themselves natural properties. (Or, if naturalness\nadmits of degrees, they are much less natural than the disjuncts in\nterms of which they can be expressed.) (Langton and Lewis 1998: 61,\nauthor\u2019s emphasis)\n\n\nSecondly, they say a property is basic intrinsic iff it is\nnon-disjunctive, is not the negation of a disjunctive property, and is\nindependent of accompaniment. Finally, they say that (i) two objects\nare duplicates iff they share the same basic intrinsic properties, and\n(ii) \\(F\\) is an intrinsic property iff two duplicates never differ\nwith respect to it.\n\nThe last step of their account is in a form that requires\nLewis\u2019s concretist theory of possible worlds. The last step in a\nform suitable for a typical abstractionist theory of possible worlds\nis instead:\n\n\\(x\\) at \\(u\\) is a duplicate of \\(y\\) at \\(v\\) iff, for any basic\nintrinsic property \\(P, x\\) has \\(P\\) at \\(u\\) iff \\(y\\) has \\(P\\) at\n\\(v\\); and\n\\(F\\) is intrinsic iff, for any \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and for any\npossible worlds \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) such that \\(x\\) at \\(u\\) is a\nduplicate of \\(y\\) at \\(v, x\\) has \\(F\\) at \\(u\\) iff \\(y\\) has \\(F\\)\nat \\(v\\).\n\n\nNote that (ii) is just the abstractionist version of the duplication\ncharacterisation for intrinsicality given by (13) in section\n 2.4.\n\nLangton and Lewis claim their account works given a variety of ways of\nunderstanding \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018more natural\nthan\u2019 in their analysis of \u2018non-disjunctive\u2019. In\nparticular, they hold that the account will work if\n\u2018natural\u2019 is understood to express the notion of perfect\nnaturalness, or fundamentality, in the Lewis (1986a) account, and\n\u2018more natural than\u2019 is understood to mean \u2018is more\nfundamental than\u2019. They also claim that the account will work if\nthe natural properties are those taken to correspond to Armstrongian\nuniversals, or the properties expressed by the predicates in canonical\nformulations of physics, or the properties expressed by the predicates\nin canonical formulations of common-sense. Langton and Lewis say that\nit should not matter how we draw the distinction between natural and\nnon-natural properties for present purposes, as long as we have it,\nand properties like being lonely and round or accompanied and\ncubical are not natural. As a result of this, Langton and Lewis\nthink that their account is more neutral than Lewis\u2019s earlier\naccount and should therefore should appeal to a larger range of\nphilosophers than the earlier account.\n\nLangton and Lewis put forward their account as only an analysis of\nqualitative intrinsic properties, rather than intrinsic properties in\ngeneral. Their account, however, arguably fails as an account of\nqualitative identity interior properties since, given numbers\nnecessarily exist, it classifies being such that there is a number as\nintrinsic. Therefore, like the Lewis 1986a account, the Langton and\nLewis account is arguably most charitably interpreted as an account of\nduplication preservation, or perhaps of qualitative metaphysical\nnecessitation interiority.\n\nIn addition to failing to give an account of the standard account of\nintrinsicality, there are reasons to think that Langton and Lewis\ncannot be as neutral as they claim to be regarding what account of\nnaturalness is combined with their account. As noted above, Langton\nand Lewis claim that their account of intrinsicality is compatible\nwith any construal of naturalness on which the natural properties are\nthose that play a special role in our thinking. On one such conception\nof naturalness, the natural properties include those properties for\nwhich we have simple words or concepts, which do not strike us as\nstrange or odd, and on which we have relied in past inductions (Sider\n2001: 362). Given this conception of naturalness, the property of\nbeing a rock is a natural property, and hence is classified as\nintrinsic on the Langton and Lewis account. However, as Sider 2001\nargues, being a rock is plausibly not an intrinsic property. Just as\nan object that is qualitatively intrinsically the same as a house and\nis a large part of a house is not itself a house, an object that is\nqualitatively intrinsically the same as a rock and is a large part of\na rock is not itself a rock. Hence, whether something is a rock is\npartly a matter of what is the case outside of it. Hence, contra the\ncombination of the Langton and Lewis account with the above conception\nof naturalness, being a rock is not intrinsic.\n\nAnother objection to the Langton and Lewis account is that there\nappear to be counterexamples to the account, even given Lewis\u2019s\nfavoured conception of naturalness. On this conception, the perfectly\nnatural properties and relations are the fundamental properties and\nrelations, and a property \\(p\\) is more natural than a property \\(q\\)\niff the shortest definition of \\(p\\) in terms of the perfectly natural\nproperties and relations is shorter than the shortest definition of\n\\(q\\) in terms of the perfectly natural properties and relations. (See\n(Lewis 1986: 61).) As Marshall and Parsons 2001 argue, given this\nconstrual of naturalness, the property of being such that there is a\ncube appears to be neither a disjunctive property nor the negation of a\ndisjunctive property according to Langton and Lewis\u2019s account of\ndisjunctivity. If this is the case, however, then, since being such\nthat there is a cube is independent of accompaniment, the Langton and\nLewis account classifies this property as a basic intrinsic property,\nand hence classifies it as an intrinsic property. This property,\nhowever, is clearly not intrinsic.\n\nLangton and Lewis 2001 have responded to this objection by claiming\nthat being such that there is a cube is less natural than both being a\ncube and being accompanied by a cube, since (I) being such that there\nis a cube can be expressed as the disjunction \u2018being either a\ncube or accompanied by a cube\u2019, (II) disjoining unrelated\nproperties always reduces naturalness, and (III) being a cube and\nbeing accompanied by a cube are unrelated properties. One problem with\nthis response is that it is not obvious why (II) is meant to be true\ngiven Lewis\u2019s favoured conception of naturalness above, or what\nother notion of naturalness it might be true of. A second problem with\nthe response is that, even granting (II) is true, it is not clear what\nit is for two properties to be unrelated in the sense that is at issue\nin (II), and hence it is not clear why being a cube and being\naccompanied by a cube are meant to be unrelated.
