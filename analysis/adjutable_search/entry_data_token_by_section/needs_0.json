    "main_text": "The normativity of need\n1. The normativity of need\n\n\nThe role that needs should play in our practical reasoning is a hotly\ncontested topic. On one side stand philosophers who argue that the\nneeds of others always impose moral demands on us, or more strongly\nstill that the very idea of moral obligation cannot be understood\nexcept with reference to needs (see Reader 2007, chs. 4\u20135; Weil\n1952, 3\u20139). They are also likely to believe that meeting\nneeds should be a primary aim of public policy. On the other side\nstand philosophers who argue that needs are a false currency; they\nappear to be both objective and fundamental, but in fact are neither,\nsince claims of need always make tacit reference to some further end\nfor which the thing claimed is necessary (Barry 1965, 47\u20139;\nFlew 1981, ch. 5; White 1975, ch. 8). Moreover in politics, appeals to\nneed are not only misleading, but dangerous, because the obligations\nthey apparently impose can serve to justify indefinitely expanding the\nscope of government at the expense of individual freedom (Minogue\n1963, ch. 4).\n\n\nHow should we respond to this contest? It is tempting to sidestep the\ncontroversy over needs by substituting other concepts that cover some\nof the same terrain but are viewed as less contestable\u2014such as\nresources, welfare, or capabilities\u2014and as we shall see later,\nneeds have played a smaller part than one might expect in recent\npolitical philosophy. Yet there remains something compelling about the\nidea of need. To say that a human being is in need\u2014is ill, or\nstarving, or threatened by danger\u2014seems on the face of it to\nidentify a state of affairs that calls for immediate remedy. In\neveryday life, the language of need is pervasive. We talk constantly\nof the needs of children, the elderly, the poor, the sick, the lonely,\nand so on. We should not be too quick, therefore, to assume that\nneeds-talk can easily be replaced by some other idiom. Instead we\nshould try to understand how the controversy has arisen, and whether\nit can be resolved by more careful specification of the needs claims\nthat have non-derivative practical force.\n",
