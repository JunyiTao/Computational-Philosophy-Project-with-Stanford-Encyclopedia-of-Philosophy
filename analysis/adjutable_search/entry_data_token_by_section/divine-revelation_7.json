    "main_text": "The Justification of Revelatory Claims || .4 Hybridism\n2.4 Sui Generis Approaches\n\nA possibility (or purported possibility) that has not been considered\nso far, is that belief in divine revelation could be justified in a\nway that is totally sui generis. Inspired by Kierkegaard,\nKarl Barth seems to suggest something like this. Human nature is not\nin any way adapted to receive knowledge of God, according to Barth,\nand hence there can be no philosophical explanation of how knowledge\nof God comes about. However, God himself could provide such knowledge\nwithout respecting the criteria of any epistemological canon. Barth\nwriters:\n\n\nTo say \u201cGod with us\u201d is to say something which has no\nbasis or possibility outside itself, which can in no sense be\nexplained in terms of man and man\u2019s situation, but only as\nknowledge of God from God, as free and unmerited grace. As the Bible\nbears witness to God\u2019s revelation and as Church proclamation\ntakes up this witness in obedience, both renounce any foundation apart\nfrom that which God has given once and for all by speaking (Barth\n1975: 119\u2013120).\n\n\nCritics have accused Barth of portraying revelation \n\n\nas something having full authority over the insights of reason and\nsensibility, and as not in any way subject to them. (Quash 2007: 334)\n\n\n\nAccording to Pannenberg, this is equivalent to fideism. \n\n\nBarth\u2019s apparently so lofty objectivity about God and\nGod\u2019s word turns out to rest on no more than the irrational\nsubjectivity of a venture of faith with no justification outside\nitself. (1976: 273)\n\n\nIn response to this kind of criticism, theologians in the\n\u201cpostliberal\u201d tradition (inspired by Barth) have argued\nthat revelation is not an epistemological concept at all. The\nChristian doctrine of revelation does not purport to explain how\nChristina beliefs are justified. Instead, it provides an\nintra-theological explication of God\u2019s prevenient grace\n(Thiemann 1985: 4). Some have even gone so far as to say that\n\u201cthe very idea that the Bible is revealed \u2026 is a claim\nthat creates more trouble than it is worth\u201d (Hauerwas 1981: 57).\nFor postliberal theologians in general, Christian beliefs are\njustified by being part of a coherent web of beliefs (Marshall\n2000).\n\nHowever, perhaps a better way of defending Barth is suggested by Hans\nUrs von Balthasar. He shares Barth\u2019s general view of revelation\nas epistemically self-authenticating and as providing its own warrant,\nindependently of human preconceptions (Chapp 2004: 11). However,\nBalthasar attempts to make this view intelligible by suggesting an\nanalogy with aesthetic experience. In Mozart\u2019s Jupiter\nSymphony, for example, every note seems to be necessary in the\nsense that any change would make the symphony less beautiful. However,\nnobody (except Mozart himself) could have said in advance that\nprecisely this combination of notes is necessary in order to\nproduce such beauty. Hence, our recognition of the beauty or\nperfection of the symphony happens without reference to any criteria\nor rules that we could have stated independently of encountering the\nsymphony itself. In a similar way, revelation possesses its own\nintrinsic credibility, rooted in the self-authenticating glory of God.\n\u201cDivine love\u201d, writes Balthasar, \n\n\ncan appear in such an overwhelming way that its glorious majesty\nthrows one to the ground; it shines out as the last word and leaves\none no choice but to respond in the mode of pure, blind obedience.\n(Balthasar 2004: 53, 57) \n\n",
