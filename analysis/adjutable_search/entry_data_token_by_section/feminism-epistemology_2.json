    "main_text": "Feminist Postmodernism\n3. Feminist Postmodernism\n\nGeneral Postmodernist Themes.\nPostmodernism\n draws inspiration from poststructuralist and postmodernist theorists,\nincluding Derrida, Foucault, Irigaray, Lacan, Lyotard, and Saussure.\nIt questions attempts to transcend situatedness by appeal to such\nideas as universality, necessity, objectivity, essence, and\nfoundations. It stresses the locality, partiality, contingency,\ninstability, uncertainty, ambiguity and essential contestability of\nany particular view of the world and the good. The postmodernist\nemphasis on revealing the situatedness and contestability of any claim\nor system serves both critical and liberatory functions. It\ndelegitimizes ideas that dominate and exclude by undermining their\nclaims to ultimate justification. And it opens up space for imagining\nalternative possibilities that were obscured by those claims.\n\nPostmodernists claim that what we think of as reality is\n\u201cdiscursively constructed.\u201d According to Saussure,\n\u201cthe linguistic sign acts reflexively, not referentially\u201d\nin a \u201cdiscursive field.\u201d This amounts to radical holism about meaning: signs get their meaning not from their reference to external\nthings but from their relations to all the other signs in the\ndiscourse. Introducing new signs (or discarding old ones) thus changes\nthe meanings of the signs already in use. Signs therefore lack a fixed\nmeaning over time. These ideas support the rejection of what Lyotard\ncalls \u201ctotalizing metanarratives.\u201d There can be no\ncomplete, unified theory of the world that captures the whole truth. A\ndiscourse with different terms would contain meanings not available in\nthe discursive field of the theory that claims completeness. The\nassertion of any particular theory is an exercise of\n\u201cpower\u201d\u2014to exclude certain possibilities from\nthought and authorize others. Postmodernist claims that objects are\n\u201cdiscursively constructed\u201d or \u201csocially\nconstructed\u201d assert a kind of nominalism: that the world does\nnot dictate the categories we use to describe it, that innumerable\nincompatible ways of classifying the world are available to us. The\nselection of any one theory is a choice that cannot be justified by\nappeal to \u201cobjective\u201d truth or reality.\n\nSocial practices also function as linguistic signs. For example, the\nelevation of the judge\u2019s bench metaphorically signifies the\njudge\u2019s superior authority over others in the courtroom. As\nwords get their meaning from their relations to other words, so do\nactions get their meaning from their relations to other actions,\nrather than from their relation to some pre-linguistic realm of human\nnature or natural law. Thus, the superior authority of judges consists\nin the conventions of deference others manifest toward them. It is not\nunderwritten by an underlying normatively objective authority. The\nlatter thought expresses an essentialist and objectivist power play,\nattempting to foreclose contests over practices by fixing them in a\nsupposedly extra-discursive reality. The meanings of actions can be\nsubverted by other actions that, in changing the context, changes\ntheir meanings. This is why postmodernists celebrate ironic, parodic,\nand campy renditions of conventional behaviors as politically\nliberating (Butler 1993).\n\nThe self is likewise constituted by signs. There is no unified self\nthat underlies the play of a stream of signifiers. Although\nsubjectivity is constituted through the production of signs, the self\nis entangled in a web of meanings not of its own creation: our\nidentities are socially imposed. However, this does not foreclose\nagency, because we occupy multiple social identities (a woman might be\na worker, a mother, lesbian, Mexican, etc.). Tensions among these\nidentities open up spaces for disrupting the discursive systems that\nconstruct us.\n\nFeminist Postmodernism.\n Feminist postmodernist ideas are deployed against theories that\npurport to justify sexist practices\u2014notably, ideologies that\nclaim that observed differences between men and women are natural and\nnecessary, or that women have an essence that explains and justifies\ntheir subordination. The claim that gender is socially or discursively\nconstructed\u2014that it is an effect of social practices and systems\nof meaning that can be disrupted\u2014finds a home in postmodernism\n(Butler 1990). However, postmodernism has figured more prominently in\ninternal critiques of feminist theories. One of the most important\ntrends in feminist thinking has been exposing and responding to\nexclusionary tendencies within feminism itself. Women of color and\nlesbian women have argued that mainstream feminist theories have\nignored their problems and perspectives (Collins 1990; Hull, Scott,\nand Smith, 1982; Lorde 1984).\n\nThe critique of the concept \u201cwoman.\u201d\n Feminist postmodernists have criticized many of the leading feminist\ntheories of gender and patriarchy as essentialist (Butler 1990, Flax\n1990, Spelman 1988). Essentialism here refers to any theory that\npostulates a universal, transhistorical, necessary cause or\nconstitution of gender or patriarchy. Feminist postmodernists object\nthat, in claiming that gender identity is one thing or has one cause,\nsuch theories convert discursively constructed facts into norms,\ndifference into deviance. They either exclude women who don\u2019t\nconform to the theory from the class of \u201cwomen,\u201d or\nrepresent them as inferior. Critiques of feminist theories by lesbian\nwomen and women of color reinforce skepticism about the unity of the\ncategory \u201cwoman\u201d by highlighting intersectioning\nidentities of gender, race, class, trans/cis, and sexual orientation. The\nfaultlines for fragmentating the category \u201cwoman\u201d are thus\nother identities along which social inequalities are constructed.\n\nThis critique of \u201cwoman\u201d as a unified object of\ntheorizing entails that \u201cwoman\u201d also cannot constitute a\nunified subject of knowing (Lugones & Spelman 1983). The\ntheories of universal gender identity under attack are ones in which\nthe authors, white middle class heterosexual women, could see\nthemselves. Critics claim that the authors fail to acknowledge their\nown situatedness and hence the ways they are implicated in and\nreproduce power relations\u2014in this case, the presumption of white\nmiddle class heterosexual women to define \u201cthe standpoint of\nwomen\u201d\u2014to speak for all other women. Feminist standpoint\ntheorists, who claim an epistemic privilege on behalf of their\nstandpoint, thereby unjustifiably assert a race and class privilege\nover other women. This lesson applies to subaltern feminist\nstandpoints as well. The assertion of a black feminist standpoint, for\nexample, objectionably essentializes black women. Once the\npostmodernist critique of essentialism is granted, there is no logical\nstopping point in the proliferation of perspectives.\n\nPerspective shifting. Feminist postmodernism envisions our\nepistemic situation as characterized by a shifting plurality of\nperspectives, none of which can claim objectivity\u2014that is,\ntranscendence of situatedness. This position rejects both objectivism\nand relativism for the ways they let knowers escape responsibility for\nthe representations they construct (Haraway 1991). People are not\nepistemically trapped inside their cultures, their gender, or any\nother identity. They can think from other perspectives. Thus, although\nwe will always have plural perspectives, their constitution is always\nshifting, without a stable correspondence between individuals and\nperspectives. Negotiating the array of situated knowledges involves\ntwo types of epistemic practice. One is acceptance of responsibility:\nacknowledging the choices of situation involved in constructing\none\u2019s representations (Haraway 1991), and considering how they\naffect the content of one\u2019s representations (Harding 1993). The\nsecond is \u201cworld traveling\u201d (Lugones 1987) or\n\u201cmobile positioning\u201d\u2014trying to see things from many\nother perspectives. Mobile positioning can never be transparent or innocent. Imagining oneself in another\u2019s situation is\nrisky, requiring sensitive engagement with and sympathy for occupants\nof those positions. Both transform situated knowing into a critical\nand responsible practice.\n\nCriticisms of Feminist Postmodernism. Both features\nof feminist postmodernism\u2014the rejection of \u201cwoman\u201d\nas a category of analysis, and the fragmentation of\nperspectives\u2014are controversial. Wholesale opposition to broad\ngeneralizations about women may preclude critical analysis of\nlarge-scale social forces that affect women (Benhabib 1995). That\nwomen in different social positions experience sexism differently does\nnot entail that they have nothing in common\u2014they still suffer\nfrom sexism (MacKinnon 2000). Intersectionality may be accommodated\nthrough a structural analysis of gender that allows for racialized and\nother particularized modes of sexist oppression (Haslanger 2000).\nPostmodernist fragmentation threatens both the possibility of\nanalytical focus and of politically effective coalition building among\ndiverse women. Yet, virtually all feminists acknowledge that a\nplurality of situated knowledges appears to be an inescapable\nconsequence of social differentiation and embodiment.\n",
