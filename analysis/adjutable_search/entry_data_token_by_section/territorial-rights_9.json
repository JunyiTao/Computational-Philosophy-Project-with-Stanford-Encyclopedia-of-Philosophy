    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Territory || Consent and Natural Property Theories\n3.2 Consent and Natural Property Theories\n\nThere are many internal disputes amongst contemporary Lockean-inspired\ntheorists concerning the appropriate understanding of Locke\u2019s\nargument and the extent to which Locke is vulnerable to some of the\nstandard objections. An objection was raised earlier that might be\ncalled the Swiss cheese objection: it seems unlikely that a consent\nargument can justify the contiguous territorial control that we might\nexpect of a state. Some Lockean theorists, such as Hillel Steiner\n(1996: 144), are happy enough to accept this as an implication of a\nLockean theory, but deny that it is a problem, or anyway not a fatal\nproblem. A. John Simmons, however, has argued that the functional\nstrand in Locke\u2019s theory does important work, so that, \n\n\nwhen people consent to make or join a political society, their consent\nshould normally be understood as consent to whatever arrangements are\nnecessary for a peaceful, stable society. (Simmons 2001: 313) \n\n\nOn his view, Locke\u2019s argument has the conceptual resources to\nlimit the ability of property-owners to exit or sell their land to\npeople who do not accept the sovereign\u2019s jurisdictional\nauthority, and to ensure that all subsequent holders of the land will\nbe bound by the obligations of state membership. In this way, Simmons\ncontends, the Lockean argument can address two of the most important\nsources of non-contiguity. \n\nThere is however a rival interpretation of Locke\u2019s theory,\nadvanced by Bas van der Vosssen (2015), according to which\nstates\u2019 external boundaries are conceived of as the product of\nconsent amongst sovereign authorities themselves, thus developing a\ntwo-stage argument for territorial rights. It is, however, not clear\nwhether this interpretation can be easily reconciled with the\ndistinctive feature of Locke\u2019s account, which is the idea of\nproperty-holders consenting to create territory.\n\nCara Nine\u2019s early articles and her 2012 book Global Justice\nand Territory also make use of Locke\u2019s theory to explain\nhow a state can gain entitlement to a territory. She argues that a\nstate improves its territory, adding value to the area via the\nenforcement of jurisdictional rules about property, contract, and so\non. This use of Locke to justify territory by a corporate agent is\ncoherent but it is purely retrospective: it tells us that a state can\nbe entitled to an area on the basis of what it has done, but since the\nstate excludes other potential claimants it cannot really show that it\nhas done more than other contending territorial agents would have\ndone, nor does it offer the resources to decide between two contending\ngroups, each aspiring to create a state in the region (and thereby\nengage in the value-enhancing jurisdictional activity). Nine\u2019s\nrecent work on Pufendorf and her emphasis on conventional agreements\nunder certain conditions is focused on addressing that problem.\n\nA. John Simmons, in his book Boundaries of Authority (2016),\noffers a more self-consciously Lockean theory of territory. Simmons\ncomplains that all existing territorial theories\u2014nationalist,\nself-determination theories, justice theories\u2014tend to accept a\nversion of Waldron\u2019s (1992) supersession thesis, which is the\nview that historic rights (to land) weaken over time. Simmons rejects\nthis view, arguing, like Locke, that all political authority, to be\nrightful, has to be grounded in consent. He holds that indigenous\npeople were doubly wronged, because not only did they not consent to\nthe state, but their collectively owned property was also wrongfully\nannexed. This line of argument reveals a significant difference\nbetween Lockeans (who have an historical argument about justice) and\nother theorists. Lockeans tend to think that rights in\nthings\u2014including rights in land\u2014are heritable and do not\ndisappear as the specific right-holders and wrongdoers die off, or\nwhen the property that they had is wrongfully taken from them.\n\nHowever, it could be argued that Simmons\u2019 position is\ncounter-intuitive, because we often do feel that the passage of time\nmatters to the existence of rights. After all, if the interests that\ngrounded the right no longer apply (due to changes wrought by the\npassage of time), then it seems that this will affect the right (which\nwas designed to protect said interest). It\u2019s hard to avoid this\nconclusion if we think of rights as protecting human interests, some\nof which may be relational or contingent. A deeper problem, to which\nthis point gives rise, is that Simmons presents his Lockeanism as\n\u201can ideal theory\u201d. However, almost everything that we are\ninterested in\u2014wrongful political incorporation, theft of land\nand then subsequent transfer\u2014are instances of non-ideal theory,\nand it is not fully clear how Simmons\u2019 Lockean insights are\nmeant to apply in the real world. It does suggest that we need a\nprocess of apology or rectification, but Simmons does not elaborate on\nthe form that rectification in the present should take, and how it\nmight be reconciled with the claims, if any, of descendants of\nwrongful settlers, or of settler states. \n",
