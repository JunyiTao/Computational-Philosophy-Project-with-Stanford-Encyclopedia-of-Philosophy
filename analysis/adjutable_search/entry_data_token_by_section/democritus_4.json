Theory of Knowledge\n\nOne report credits Democritus and Leucippus with the view that thought\nas well as sensation are caused by images impinging on the body from\noutside, and that thought as much as perception depends on images (DK\n67A30). Thought as well as perception are described as changes in the\nbody. Democritus apparently recognized that his view gives rise to an\nepistemological problem: it takes our knowledge of the world to be\nderived from our sense experience, but the senses themselves not to be\nin direct contact with the nature of things, thus leaving room for\nomission or error. A famous fragment may be responding to such a\nskeptical line of thought by accusing the mind of overthrowing the\nsenses, though those are its only access to the truth (DK68B125).\nOther passages talk of a gap between what we can perceive and what\nreally exists (DK 68B6\u201310; 117). But the fact that atoms are not\nperceptible means that our knowledge of their properties is always\nbased on analogy from the things of the visible world. Moreover, the\nsenses report properties that the atoms don\u2019t really possess, like\ncolors and tastes. Thus the potential for doubt about our knowledge of\nthe external world looms large.\n\nLater philosophers adapted a Democritean phrase ou mallon or\n\u2018no more\u2019 in the argument that something that seems both P\nand not-P is \u2018no more\u2019 P than not-P. Arguments of this\nform were used for sceptical purposes, citing the conflicting evidence\nof the senses in order to raise concern about our knowledge of the\nworld (de Lacy 1958). Democritus does not seem to be pursuing a\nconsistently skeptical program, although he does express concern about\nthe basis for our knowledge.\n\nThe idea that our knowledge is based on the reception of images from\noutside us is employed in Democritus\u2019 discussion of the gods, wherein\nit is clear that our knowledge of the gods comes from\neid\u00f4la or giant films of atoms with the characteristics\nwe attribute to the gods, although Democritus denies that they are\nimmortal. Some scholars take this to be a deflationary attack on\ntraditional theology as based on mere images (Barnes 1982, pp.\n456\u201361), but others suppose that the theory posits that these\neid\u00f4la are really living beings (Taylor 1999a, pp.\n211\u20136). Although atomism is often identified as an atheist\ndoctrine in later times, it is not clear whether this is really\nDemocritus\u2019 view.\n",
