    "main_text": "The Most Prominent Pythagoreans of the Fifth and Fourth Century || Aristotle\u2019s \u201cSo-called\u201d Pythagoreans\n2.3 Aristotle\u2019s \u201cSo-called\u201d Pythagoreans\n\nAristotle refers to the Pythagoreans frequently in his extant works,\nespecially in the Metaphysics. There are several puzzles\nabout these references. First, his usual practice is to refer to the\nPythagoreans as a group rather than naming individuals. He mentions\nPhilolaus and Eurytus by name only once each and Archytas four times.\nYet, the basic Pythagorean system which he describes in most detail in\nMetaphysics 1.5 shows such strong similarities to the\nfragments of Philolaus that Philolaus must be the primary source\n(Huffman 1993, 28\u201394, Schofield 2012, 147), although some\nscholars emphasize that Aristotle clearly did use other sources\n(Primavesi 2012, 255) and even that Philolaus, while perhaps the acme\nof Pythagorean philosophy, might not have represented mainstream\nPythagoreanism thus explaining why Aristotle refers to the\nPythagoreans as a group rather than singling out Philolaus (McKirahan\n2013). Second, he frequently refers to the Pythagoreans that he\ndiscusses as the \u201cso-called\u201d Pythagoreans. Why does he add\nthe qualifying phrase \u201cso-called?\u201d This phrase indicates\nnot that these are false Pythagoreans in contrast to some other true\nPythagoreans but rather that this is the standard way of referring to\nthese people, it is what people call them; but the phrase also\nindicates that Aristotle has reservations about the name. Aristotle is\nexpressing his doubts about how or whether these figures are connected\nto Pythagoras himself, whom Aristotle regards as a wonder-working\nfounder of a way of life rather than as participating in the tradition\nof Presocratic cosmology (Huffman 1993, 31\u201334). It could also be\nthat it is the very variety of sources that Aristotle is using that\nleads him to recognize that there are quite different stages in the\ndevelpment of Pythagoreanism and hence to wonder in what sense a\nfigure like Philolaus who is at the end of that development should\nstill be called a Pythagorean (Primavesi 2014).\n\nThe biggest puzzle, however, concerns the philosophical system that\nAristotle assigns to the Pythagoreans. For the purposes of his\ndiscussion in the Metaphysics, he treats most Pythagoreans as\nadopting a mainstream system in contrast to another group of\nPythagoreans whose system is based on the table of opposites (see\nsection 2.4). The central thesis of the mainstream system is stated in\ntwo basic ways: the Pythagoreans say that things are numbers or that\nthey are made out of numbers. In his most extended account of the\nsystem in Metphysics 1.5, Aristotle says that the\nPythagoreans were led to this view by noticing more similarities\nbetween things and numbers than between things and the elements, such\nas fire and water, adopted by earlier thinkers. The Pythagoreans thus\nconcluded that things were or were made of numbers and that the\nprinciples of numbers, the odd and the even, are principles of all\nthings. The odd is limited and the even unlimited. Aristotle\ncriticizes the Pythagoreans for being so enamored of numerical order\nthat they imposed it on the world even where it was not suggested by\nthe phenomena. Thus appearances suggested that there were nine\nheavenly bodies orbiting in the heavens but, since they regarded ten\nas the perfect number, they supposed that there must be a tenth\nheavenly body, the counter-earth, which we cannot see. Later,\nAristotle is also critical of the Pythagoreans for employing\nprinciples that do not derive from the sensible world, i.e.,\nmathematical principles, even though all their efforts were directed\nat explaining the physical world (Metaphysics 989b29). How\ncan they explain features of physical bodies such as weight or motion\nusing principles which have no weight and do not move\n(990a8\u2013990a16)? Indeed, it becomes clear that Aristotle\ninterpreted the Pythagorean cosmogony as starting out by constructing\nthe number one. The one then draws in the unlimited and produces the\nrest of the number series and evidently the cosmos at the same time.\nThe number one and the other numbers from 1 to 10 are conceived of as\nphysical entities (Metaphysics 1091a13\u201318). The puzzle\nis that Aristotle\u2019s description makes clear that he is basically\ndescribing Philolaus\u2019 system (e.g., the counter-earth, limit and\nunlimited, the generation of a one), yet a number of his central\nassertions are flatly contradicted by the surviving fragments of\nPhilolaus. Most importantly, Philolaus never says that things are\nnumbers or are made out of numbers. For Philolaus things are composed\nof limiters and unlimiteds held together by harmony (Frs. 1, 2 and 6)\nand unlimiteds appear to include physical things like fire and breath\n(Fr. 7, Aristotle Fr. 201). Numbers and the odd and the even do play a\nprominent role in Philolaus (Frs. 4\u20135), but there is no hint\nthat they are understood as physical entites. Instead number has an\nepistemological role: all things are known through number (Fr. 4). How\nare we to explain this tension between what Aristotle reports and the\nfragments of Philolaus? One approach is to recognize that Aristotle is\nnot giving a historical report of what the Pythagoreans said but an\ninterpretation of what he found in Philolaus and others. He does not\nin fact know of any text in which the Pythagoreans said that things\nwere numbers or were made of numbers. Instead this is a conclusion\ndrawn by Aristotle; it is his summary statement of what the\nPythagorean system amounts to. That this is what Aristotle is doing is\nsuggested by another passage in the Metaphysics where he\nstarts out by flatly stating that the Pythagoreans say that all things\nare numbers but then goes on to add \u201cat least they apply\nmathematical theories to bodies as if they (the bodies) consisted of\nthose numbers\u201d(Metaphysics 1083b16). The \u201cat\nleast\u201d and \u201cas if\u201d show that Aristotle is drawing an\ninference rather than referring to any explicit statement by the\nPythagoreans that things are numbers. Thus for Philolaus there are\nanalogies between numbers and things and numbers give us knowledge of\nthings but Aristotle mistakenly takes this to be equivalent to saying\nthat things are numbers or are made of numbers. Another approach is to\nargue that Aristotle was right that Philolaus and other Pythagoreans\nthought of the number one and other numbers as physical entities. The\none constructed in Philolaus Fr. 7 is not just the primal physical\nunity but also the number one (Schofield 2012). At the opposite\nextreme, Zhmud argues that Aristotle has essentially invented this\nPythagorean system with little regard for what any actual Pythagoreans\nsaid in order to serve as background for his account of Plato\u2019s\ntheory of principles (2012a, 438, 394\u2013414). Another approach\ntries to mitigate the differences between Philolaus and Aristotle and\nsuggests that Aristotle\u2019s emphasis on number was derived from\nPythagorean numerology that was independent of Philolaus but that was\ncombined with material from Philolaus as a result of Aristotle\u2019s\ndecision to present one mainstream Pythagorean system (Primavesi\n2012). \n",
