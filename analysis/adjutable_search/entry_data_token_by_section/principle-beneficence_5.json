Is Beneficent Action Obligatory or Merely a Moral Ideal?\n\n\nAs discussion above about the continuum of beneficence indicates,\ndeep disagreements have emerged in moral theory regarding how much is\ndemanded by obligations of beneficence. Some ethical theories insist\nnot only that there are obligations of beneficence, but that these\nobligations sometimes demand severe sacrifice and extreme generosity in\nthe moral life. Some formulations of utilitarianism, for example,\nappear to derive obligations to give our job to a person who needs it\nmore than we do, to give away most of our income, to devote much of our\ntime to civic enterprises, etc. It is likely that no society has ever\noperated on such a demanding principle, but it does seem embraced, at\nleast abstractly, by a number of moral philosophers\u2014arguably even\nin Kant\u2019s theory of the categorical imperative (although, as previously\nmentioned, Kant seems to deny such scope to obligatory\nbeneficence).\n\n\nBy contrast, some moral philosophers have claimed that we have no\ngeneral obligations of beneficence. We have only duties of beneficence\nthat derive from specific roles and assignments of duty that are not a\npart of ordinary morality. These philosophers hold that beneficent\naction is virtuous and a commendable moral ideal, but not an\nobligation, and thus that persons are not morally deficient if they\nfail to act beneficently. An instructive example is found in the moral\ntheory of Bernard Gert, who maintains that there are no moral rules of\nbeneficence, only moral ideals. The only obligations in the moral life,\napart from duties encountered in professional roles and other specific\nstations of duty, are captured by moral rules that prohibit causing\nharm or evil. In Gert\u2019s theory, the general goal of morality is to\nminimize the causation of evil or harm, not to promote good. Rational\npersons morally should act impartially at all times in regard to all\npersons with the aim of not causing evil, he argues, but rational\npersons are not morally required to act impartially to promote the good\nfor all persons at all times.\n\n\nThose who defend such a beneficence-negating conclusion (regarding\nobligation) do not hold the extreme view that there are no obligations\nof beneficence in contexts of role-assigned duties such as those in\nprofessional ethics and in specific communities. They acknowledge that\nprofessional and other roles carry obligations (or duties, as Gert\nprefers) that do not bind persons who do not occupy the relevant roles.\nThey claim that the actions one is obligated to perform within the\nroles are merely moral ideals for any person who is not in the specific\nrole. That is, these philosophers present beneficence not as a general\nobligation, but as a role-specific duty and as institutionally or\nculturally assigned.\n\n\nIn rejecting principles of obligatory beneficence, Gert draws the\nline of obligations by presenting a sharp contrast between beneficence\nand nonmaleficence. That is, he embraces rules of obligation that\nprohibit causing harm to other persons, even though he rejects\nas obligatory all principles or rules that require helping\nother persons, which includes acting to prevent harm to them.\nAccordingly, he accepts moral rules such as \u201cDon\u2019t kill,\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t cause pain or suffering to others,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t\nincapacitate others,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t deprive others of the goods of\nlife,\u201d and the like. His theory therefore makes nonmaleficence\ncentral to his theory of moral obligation while denying that\nbeneficence has a place in the theory of obligation.\n\n\nHowever, the mainstream of moral philosophy makes both not-harming\nand helping to be obligations, while preserving the distinction between\nthe two. This literature can be confusing, because some writers treat\nobligations of nonmaleficence as a species of obligations of\nbeneficence, although the two notions are very different. Rules of\nbeneficence are typically more demanding than rules of nonmaleficence,\nand rules of nonmaleficence are negative prohibitions of action that\nmust be followed impartially and that provide moral reasons for legal\nprohibitions of certain forms of conduct. By contrast, rules of\nbeneficence state positive requirements of action, need not always be\nfollowed impartially, and rarely, if ever, provide moral reasons that\nsupport legal punishment when agents fail to abide by the rules.\n\n\nThe contrast between nonmaleficence and beneficence notwithstanding,\nordinary morality suggests that there are some rules of\nbeneficence that we are obligated to follow impartially, such as those\nrequiring that we make efforts to rescue strangers under conditions of\nminimal risk to ourselves. Even some legal punishments (as they exist\nin some legal jurisdictions) for failure to rescue strangers may be\njustifiable. Significant controversies have arisen in both law and\nmoral philosophy about how to formulate and defend such requirements,\nbut one influential idea has been to argue that a person P has an\nobligation of beneficence to help another whenever the other is at risk\nof significant loss of or damage to some basic interest; P\u2019s action is\nnecessary (singly or collaboratively) to prevent this loss or damage;\nP\u2019s action (singly or collaboratively) is likely to prevent the loss or\ndamage; and P\u2019s action does not present significant risks, costs, or\nburdens to P while the benefits that the rescued person can be expected\nto gain outweigh any burden that P is likely to incur.\n",
