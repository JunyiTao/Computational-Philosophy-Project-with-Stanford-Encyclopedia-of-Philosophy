    "main_text": "The Two Treatises Of Government || The Second Treatise of Government\n4.1 The Second Treatise of Government\n\nAn important part of Locke\u2019s project in the Second\nTreatise is to figure out what the role of legitimate government\nis, thus allowing him to distinguish the nature of illegitimate\ngovernment. Once this is done, the basis for legitimate revolution\nbecomes clear. Figuring out what the proper or legitimate role of\ncivil government is would be a difficult task indeed if one were to\nexamine the vast complexity of existing governments. How should one\nproceed? One strategy is to consider what life is like in the absence\nof civil government. Presumably this is a simpler state, one which may\nbe easier to understand. Then one might see what role civil government\nought to play. This is the strategy which Locke pursues, following\nHobbes and others. So, in the first chapter of the Second\nTreatise Locke defines political power.\n\n\nPolitical power, then, I take to be a right of\nmaking laws with penalties of death, and consequently all less\npenalties, for the regulating and preserving of property, and of\nemploying the force of the community, in the execution of such laws,\nand in the defence of the common-wealth from foreign injury; and all\nthis only for the public good. (Treatises, II, 1,3)\n\n\nIn the second chapter of The Second Treatise Locke describes\nthe state in which there is no government with real political power.\nThis is the state of nature. It is sometimes assumed that the state of\nnature is a state in which there is no government at all. This is only\npartially true. It is possible to have in the state of nature either\nno government, illegitimate government, or legitimate government with\nless than full political power. (See the section on the\n state of nature\n in the entry on Locke\u2019s political philosophy.)\n\nIf we consider the state of nature before there was government, it is\na state of political equality in which there is no natural superior or\ninferior. From this equality flows the obligation to mutual love and\nthe duties that people owe one another, and the great maxims of\njustice and charity. Was there ever such a state? There has been\nconsiderable debate about this. Still, it is plain that both Hobbes\nand Locke would answer this question affirmatively. Whenever people\nhave not agreed to establish a common political authority, they remain\nin the state of nature. It\u2019s like saying that people are in the\nstate of being naturally single until they are married. Locke clearly\nthinks one can find the state of nature in his time at least in the\n\u201cinland, vacant places of America\u201d (Second\nTreatise V. 36) and in the relations between different peoples.\nPerhaps the historical development of states also went though the\nstages of a state of nature. An alternative possibility is that the\nstate of nature is not a real historical state, but rather a\ntheoretical construct, intended to help determine the proper function\nof government. If one rejects the historicity of states of nature, one\nmay still find them a useful analytical device. For Locke, it is very\nlikely both.\n",
