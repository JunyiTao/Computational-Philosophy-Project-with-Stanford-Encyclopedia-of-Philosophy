    "main_text": "Teleology || Mechanism and Teleology\n3.4 Mechanism and Teleology\n\nThe same considerations which lead Kant to claim, in the Analytic,\nthat we must regard organisms as purposes, lead him to claim, in the\nDialectic, that their production cannot be mechanically explained and\nthat they must instead be accounted for in terms which ultimately make\nreference to teleology. In a well-known passage he declares that it\nis\n\n\nabsurd for human beings\u2026to hope that there may yet arise a\nNewton who could make conceivable even so much as the production of a\nblade of grass according to natural laws which no intention has\nordered. (\u00a775, 400)\n\n\nThe mechanical inexplicability of organisms leads to an apparent\nconflict, which Kant refers to as an \u201cantinomy of\njudgment\u201d, between two principles governing empirical scientific\nenquiry. On the one hand, we must seek to explain everything in nature\nin mechanical terms; on the other, some objects in nature resist\nmechanical explanation and we need to appeal to teleology in order to\nunderstand them (\u00a770, 387).\n\nThe question of how Kant resolves the Antinomy is controversial. At\nleast part of Kant\u2019s solution consists in the claim that both\nprinciples are merely \u201cregulative\u201d rather than\n\u201cconstitutive\u201d, that is, that they do not state how nature\nreally is, but only present principles which we must follow in\ninvestigating nature. Kant develops this solution in detail by arguing\nthat both the need for mechanistic explanation for nature as a whole,\nand the specific need to regard some products of nature (specifically,\norganisms) in teleological terms, are due to peculiarities of our\nhuman cognitive faculties. The core of this argument is given in\n\u00a777, where Kant differentiates two kinds of understanding, the\n\u201cdiscursive\u201d understanding of human beings, and a\ncontrasting \u201cintuitive\u201d understanding which (although Kant\ndoes not say so explicitly) might be ascribed to God. While a being\nwith a discursive understanding cannot understand how an organism\ncould come about in ways that do not involve teleological causation,\nthis does not mean this could not be understood by an intuitive\nunderstanding, and hence that the production of organisms is\nimpossible without such causation.\n\nThis argument on its own is not sufficient to address the question of\nhow the principles are to be reconciled in scientific enquiry, that\nis, how we are to seek a mechanical explanation of organisms (as\nrequired by the first principle) while still acknowledging that we\ncannot understand them except by appeal to purposes. Kant\u2019s\nostensible answer to this question is that we must\n\u201csubordinate\u201d mechanism to teleology (\u00a778, 414). Even\nin the case of organisms, we must pursue the search for mechanical\nexplanation as far as possible, yet while still recognizing the need\nfor an ultimate appeal to purposes. The subordination of mechanism to\nteleology is clarified in \u00a7\u00a780\u201381, in the\n\u201cMethodology of Teleological Judgment\u201d, where Kant\nconnects his views to some of the biological controversies of the day,\nregarding both the origin of the various species of plants and\nanimals, and the origin of individual plants and animals belonging to\nalready existing species. In the case of the origin of species, Kant\ntentatively endorses a view which allows the natural development of\nhigher species out of lower ones, but which denies the possibility\nthat the lower species in turn could develop out of unorganized matter\nas such. The view is \u201cmechanical\u201d to the extent that it\nunderstands the development of one species from another as a natural\nlaw-governed process which does not require special appeal to an\npurpose in the case of each new species; but the mechanism is\n\u201csubordinated to teleology\u201d in the sense that the\nstarting-point of the process, namely matter which itself has\norganization and life, is intelligible only by appeal to purposes\n(\u00a780). In the case of the origin of particular organisms, Kant\nendorses a view (epigenesis) on which the emergence of an apparently\nnew plant or animal is not just the expansion or unfolding of one\nwhich already existed in miniature (as on the preformationist view),\nbut a natural process whereby a new living thing comes into being. At\nthe same time, he denies that a living thing can come to be out of\nnon-living matter: the matter from which the embryo develops must\nalready be teleologically organized. The view is\n\u201cmechanical\u201d in the sense that it denies that each living\nthing was produced, like an artifact, in accordance with a specific\nintention, and allows instead that once matter is endowed with life\nand organization it has the power to produce other living things. But\nagain, as in the case of the origin of species, this\n\u201cmechanism\u201d depends on living matter, whose possibility we\ncan understand only in teleological terms.\n\nIt is difficult to understand the implications of Kant\u2019s\ndiscussion of mechanism and teleology without knowing what he means by\n\u201cmechanism\u201d, and unfortunately this is very hard to\ndetermine from the text. Many commentators have taken the notion of\nmechanism to be equivalent to the notion of causality in time which\nfigures in the Critique of Pure Reason, so that the principle\nof mechanism is equivalent to the causal principle which Kant takes\nhimself to have proved in the Second Analogy. If the notion of\nmechanism is understood in this way, then Kant\u2019s solution to the\nantinomy of teleological judgment is radically at odds with his views\nin the Critique of Pure Reason, since it involves the claim\nthat the principle of mechanism is merely regulative as opposed to\nconstitutive. McLaughlin (1989, 1990), and following him Allison\n(1992), reject this reading, instead taking the notion of mechanism in\nthe relevant sense to correspond to a more specific type of causality,\nnamely the causality by which the parts of a thing determine the whole\nrather than the whole\u2019s determining the parts; this view is also\ntaken by Zanetti (1993). Ginsborg (2001) offers a third proposal, on\nwhich a thing can be explained \u201cmechanically\u201d if its\nexistence can be accounted for in terms of the intrinsic powers of the\nmatter out of which it comes to be. The topic of mechanism in the\ncontext of the Critique of Judgment is discussed further in\nBreitenbach (2008) and Geiger (2017).\n\nA related interpretative issue concerns the grounds on which organisms\nresist mechanical explanation, and hence need to be understood\nteleologically. Many commentators, including McLaughlin (1990),\nAllison (1992), and Guyer (2001a, 2003b), take organisms to be\nmechanically inexplicable in virtue of the self-maintaining and\nself-producing character which distinguishes them from artifacts (see\n Section 3.3).\n On this approach, organisms have to be explained teleologically\nbecause, in contrast to machines, their parts cannot exist\nindependently of the whole to which they belong. Against this,\nGinsborg (2004) argues that the self-maintaining character of\norganisms is irrelevant to their mechanical inexplicability in the\nrelevant sense. Kant\u2019s point in emphasizing the contrast between\norganisms and machines is not to show that organisms require\nteleological explanation (since machines such as clocks are no less in\nneed of such explanation), but on the contrary to show that, as\nnatural objects rather than artefacts, they are not to be explained in\nterms of a designer\u2019s intentions. The disagreement is discussed\nfurther in Breitenbach 2006, Watkins 2009, and McLaughlin 2014, all of\nwhich engage with the related issue of how the Antinomy is\nresolved.\n\nThere is a very helpful overview of the Antinomy of Teleological\nJudgment in chapter 4 of Quarfood 2004 which includes many references\nto relevant secondary literature. More recent discussions of the\nAntinomy include, in addition to the articles mentioned in the\nprevious paragraph, Quarfood 2006, Breitenbach 2008, Quarfood 2014,\nNuzzo 2009, Huneman 2014, and Shimony 2018: the latter three articles\ndeal specifically with Kant\u2019s distinction between discursive and\nintuitive understanding in \u00a7\u00a776\u201377.\n",
