Frege\u2019s Analysis of Predecessor, Ancestrals, and the Natural Numbers\n\nIn what follows, we shall suppose that the second-order predicate\ncalculus with which we began has been extended with (a) a primitive\n\\(\\#\\) operator, so that we can formulate terms such as \\(\\#F\\) to\nsignify \u2018the number of \\(F\\)s\u2019, and (b) a new axiom,\nnamely, Hume\u2019s Principle, to govern the new terms. As previously\nmentioned, Frege\u2019s Theorem is that the Dedekind/Peano axioms of\nnumber theory are derivable as theorems in a second-order predicate\ncalculus extended in this way. In this section, we introduce the\ndefinitions required for the proof of Frege\u2019s Theorem. In the\nnext section, we go through the proof. In the final section, we\nconclude with a discussion of the philosophical questions that arise\nwhen we extend the predicate calculus in this way, and take\nHume\u2019s Principle as a replacement for Basic Law V.\n\nBefore we turn to the definitions required for the proof of\nFrege\u2019s Theorem, it would serve well to discuss one other group\nof insights underlying Frege\u2019s analysis of numbers. The first is\nthat the following series of concepts has a rather interesting\nproperty:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n&C_0 = [\\lambda x \\, x\\neqclose x] \\\\\n&C_1 = [\\lambda x \\, x\\eqclose \\#C_0] \\\\\n&C_2 = [\\lambda x \\, x\\eqclose \\#C_0 \\lor x\\eqclose \\#C_1] \\\\\n&C_3 = [\\lambda x \\, x\\eqclose \\#C_0 \\lor x\\eqclose \\#C_1 \\lor x\\eqclose \\#C_2] \\\\\n&\\text{etc.}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nThe interesting property of this series is that for each concept \\(\nC_k\\), all and only the numbers of the concepts preceding\n\\(C_k\\) in the sequence fall under \\(C_k\\). So, for example, the\nconcepts preceding \\(C_3\\) are \\(C_0\\), \\(C_1\\), and \\( C_2\\).\nAccordingly, all and only the following numbers fall under \\(\nC_3:\\#C_0, \\#C_1\\), and \\(\\#C_2\\).\n\nFrege\u2019 next insight was that these concepts can be used,\nrespectively, to define the finite cardinal numbers, as follows:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n&0 = \\#C_0 \\\\\n&1 = \\#C_1 \\\\\n&2 = \\#C_2 \\\\\n&3 = \\#C_3 \\\\\n&\\text{etc.}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nThis insight, however, led to another. Frege realized that though we\nmay identify this sequence of numbers with the natural numbers, such a\nsequence is simply a list: it does not constitute a definition of a\nconcept (e.g., natural number) that applies to all and only\nthe numbers defined in the sequence. Such a concept is required if we\nare to prove as theorems the following axioms of\nDedekind/Peano number theory: \n\nDedekind/Peano Axioms for Number Theory:\n\n\n0 is a natural number.\n0 is not the successor of any natural number.\nNo two natural numbers have the same successor.\nIf both (a) 0 falls under \\(F\\), and (b) for any two natural\nnumbers \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) such that \\(m\\) is the successor of \\(n\\), the\nfact that \\(n\\) falls under \\(F\\) implies that \\(m\\) falls under\n\\(F\\), then every natural number falls under \\(F\\). (Principle of\nMathematical Induction)\nEvery natural number has a successor.\n\n\n\nMoreover, Frege recognized the need to employ the Principle of\nMathematical Induction in the proof that every number has a successor.\nOne cannot prove the claim that every number has a successor\nsimply by producing the sequence of expressions for cardinal numbers\n(e.g., the second of the two sequences described above). All such a\nsequence demonstrates is that for every expression listed in the\nsequence, one can define an expression of the appropriate form to\nfollow it in the sequence. This is not the same as proving that \nevery natural number has a successor.\n",
