    "main_text": "Autonomy in Social and Political Philosophy || Relational Autonomy\n3.3 Relational Autonomy\n\nAs we said, several writers have claimed that proceduralist accounts\nof autonomy would wrongly attribute autonomy to those whose restricted\nsocialization and stultifying life conditions pressure them into\ninternalizing oppressive values and norms, for example women who have\ninternalized the belief in the social authority of husbands, or that\nonly by having and raising children are their lives truly complete,\nand the like. If such women reflect on these values they may well\nendorse them, even if doing so is free of any specific\nreflection-inhibiting conditions. But such women surely lack autonomy,\nit is claimed; so only if autonomy includes a requirement that one be\nable to recognize basic value claims (such as the person\u2019s own\nequal moral standing) will that concept be useful in describing the\noppressive conditions of a patriarchal society (see, e.g., Oshana,\n1998, Stoljar, 2000; for discussion see Christman 2009 chap. 8,\nBenson, 1990, Friedman, 2000, Meyers, 1987,\n 1989).[7]\n\nThese and related considerations have sparked some to develop an\nalternative conception of autonomy meant to replace allegedly overly\nindividualistic notions. This replacement has been called\n\u201crelational autonomy\u201d (MacKenzie and Stoljar, 2000a).\nSpurred by feminist critiques of traditional conceptions of autonomy\nand rights (Nedelsky, 1989, Code, 1991), relational conceptions of\nautonomy stress the ineliminable role that relatedness plays in both\npersons\u2019 self- conceptions, relative to which autonomy must be\ndefined, and the dynamics of deliberation and reasoning. These views\noffer a provocative alternative to traditional models of the\nautonomous individual, but it must be made clear what position is\nbeing taken on the issue: on the one hand, relational accounts can be\ntaken as resting on a non-individualist conception of the person and\nthen claim that insofar as autonomy is self-government and the self is\nconstituted by relations with others, then autonomy is relational; or\nthese accounts may be understood as claiming that whatever selves turn\nout to be, autonomy fundamentally involves social relations rather\nthan individual traits (Oshana, 2006). Some such views also waiver\nbetween claiming that social and personal relations play a crucial\ncausal role in the development and enjoyment of autonomy and claiming\nthat such relations constitute autonomy (for discussion see Mackenzie\nand Stoljar, 2000b, 21\u201326; for a recent overview, see Mackenzie\n2014).\n\nAnother relational element to autonomy that has been developed\nconnects social support and recognition of the person\u2019s status\nto her capacities for self-trust, self-esteem, and self-respect. The\ncore argument in these approaches is that autonomy requires the\nability to act effectively on one\u2019s own values (either as an\nindividual or member of a social group), but that oppressive social\nconditions of various kinds threaten those abilities by removing\none\u2019s sense of self-confidence required for effective agency.\nSocial recognition and/or support for this self-trusting status is\nrequired for the full enjoyment of these abilities (see Anderson and\nHonneth 2005, Grovier 1993, Benson 2005, McCleod and Sherwin 2005, and\nWestlund 2014).\n\nThese claims often are accompanied with a rejection of purportedly\nvalue-neutral, proceduralist accounts of autonomy, even those that\nattempt to accommodate a fully social conception of the self. One\nquestion that arises with relational views connected to self-trust in\nthis way: why, exactly are such relations seen as conceptually\nconstitutive of autonomy rather than contributory to it (and its\ndevelopment), where the self-confidence or self-trust in question is\nthe core element to which these sorts of social relations are an\nimportant (albeit contingent) contributor. Another question to be\nconsidered arises from those cases where self-trust is established\ndespite lack of social recognition, as when runaway slaves manage to\nheroically push on with their quest for freedom while facing violent\ndenials from surrounding others (and surrounding social structures)\nthat they enjoy the status of a full human being capable of authentic\ndecision making. Finally, self-trust is not always merited: consider\nthe brash teenager who insists on exercising social independence based\non her unwarranted confidence in her abilities to make good judgments\n(see Mackenzie 2008, n. 36).\n\nNevertheless, these approaches have all importantly shifted\nphilosophical attention concerning autonomy to the social and\ninterpersonal dynamics that shape its enjoyment, connecting ideas\nabout autonomy with broader issues of social justice, recognition, and\nsocial practices. This brings us back, then, to considerations of the\nliberal project and its potential limitations, where autonomy remains\ncentral.\n3.4 Autonomy, Liberalism, and Perfectionism\n\nAs noted earlier, there are various versions of liberal political\nphilosophy. All of them, however, are committed to a conception of\npolitical legitimacy in which political power and authority is\njustified only if such authority is acceptable to all citizens bound\nby it (see Rawls 1993, 144\u201350). This connects to a broader view\nof the foundations of value that at least some liberal theorists\npresent as central to that tradition. That is the claim that values\nare valid for a person only if those values are or can be reasonably\nendorsed by the person in question. By extension, principles guiding\nthe operation of institutions of social and political power \u2014\nwhat Rawls calls the institutions of the basic structure (Rawls 1993,\n258) \u2014 are legitimate only if they can be endorsed in this way\nby those subject to them. In this way, liberalism (in most of its\nforms) is committed to what some have called the \u201cendorsement\nconstraint\u201d (Kymlicka 1989, 12f, R. Dworkin 2000,\n216\u201318).\n\nModels of autonomy considered above include a condition that mirrors\nthis constraint, in that a person is autonomous relative to some\naction-guiding norm or value only if, upon critical reflection of that\nvalue, she identifies with it, approves of it, or does not feel deeply\nalienated from it. Combining this view with the endorsement\nconstraint, liberalism carries the implication that autonomy is\nrespected only when guiding values or principles in a society can be\nembraced in some way by those governed by them. This will connect\ndirectly to the liberal theory of legitimacy to be discussed\nbelow.\n\nPerfectionists reject this set of claims. Perfectionism is the view\nthat there are values valid for an individual or a population even\nwhen, from the subjective point of view of those agents or groups,\nthat value is not endorsed or accepted (Wall 1998, Sumner 1996,\n45\u201380, Hurka 1993, Sher 1997; see also Perfectionism). In\nshort, it is the view that there are entirely objective values. While\nthere are perfectionist liberals, this view generally resists the\nliberal claim that the autonomous acceptance of the central components\nof political principles is a necessary condition for the legitimacy of\nthose principles. Moreover, perfectionists question the liberal\ncommitment to neutrality in the formulation and application of\npolitical principles (Hurka 1993, 158\u201360).\n\nPerfectionists specifically target the liberal connection between\nrespect for autonomy and neutrality of political principles (Wall\n1998, 125\u2013204). For many, liberalism rests on the value of\nindividual autonomy, but this reliance either assumes that respect for\nautonomy is merely one value among others in the liberal view, or\nautonomy has overriding value. In either case, however, neutrality is\nnot supported. If autonomy is merely one value among others, for\nexample, then there will clearly be times when state support of those\nother values will override respect for autonomy (paternalistic\nrestrictions imposed to promote citizen safety, for example) (Sher\n1997, 45\u2013105, Hurka 1993, 158\u201360, Conly 2013). On the\nother hand, autonomy could be seen as an absolute constraint on the\npromotion of values, or, more plausibly, as a constitutive condition\nof the validity of all values for a person, as the endorsement\nconstraint implies. Perfectionists reply, however, that this is itself\na controversial value position, one that may not find unqualified\ngeneral support (Hurka 1993, 148\u201352, Sher 1997, 58\u201360,\nSumner 1996, 174\u201383; cf. Griffin 1986, 135\u2013 36). To answer\nthese objections, one must turn to consideration of the liberal\nprinciple of legitimacy. For the claim that liberals make concerning\nthe limits of state promotion of the good \u2014 a limit set by\nrespect for autonomy \u2014 depends heavily on their view about the\nultimate ground of political power.\n3.5 Autonomy and Political Liberalism\n\nLiberalism is generally understood to arise historically out of the\nsocial contract tradition of political philosophy and hence rests on\nthe idea of popular sovereignty. The concept of autonomy, then,\nfigures centrally in at least one dominant strand in this tradition,\nthe strand the runs through the work of Kant. The major alternative\nversion of the liberal tradition sees popular sovereignty as basically\na collective expression of rational choice and that the principles of\nthe basic institutions of political power are merely instrumental in\nthe maximization of aggregate citizen welfare (or, as with Mill, a\nconstitutive element of welfare broadly considered). \n\nBut it is the Kantian brand of liberalism that places autonomy of\npersons at center stage. Rawls\u2019s Theory of Justice was\nseen as the contemporary manifestation of this Kantian approach to\njustice, where justice was conceived as those principles that would be\nchosen under conditions of unbiased rational decision-making (from\nbehind the veil of ignorance). The original position where such\nprinciples would be chosen was said by Rawls to mirror Kant\u2019s\nCategorical Imperative. That is, it is a device in which persons can\nchoose principles to impose upon themselves in a way which is\nindependent of contingencies of social position, race, sex, or\nconception of the good (Rawls 1971, 221\u201327). But as is well\nknown, the Kantian foundations of Rawls\u2019s theory of justice\nrendered it vulnerable to the charge that it was inapplicable to those\npopulations (all modern populations in fact) where deep moral\npluralism abounds. For under such conditions, no theory of justice\nwhich rests on a metaphysically grounded conception of the person\ncould claim full allegiance from members of a population whose deep\ndiversity causes them to disagree about metaphysics itself, as well as\nabout moral frameworks and conceptions of value related to it. For\nthis reason, Rawls developed a new (or further developed)\nunderstanding of the foundations of his version of liberalism, a\npolitical conception (Rawls 1993).\n\nUnder political liberalism, autonomy of persons is postulated, not as\na metaphysically grounded \u201cfact\u201d about moral personality\nor practical reason as such, but rather as one of several\n\u201cdevice[s] of representation\u201d under which diverse citizens\ncan focus on the methods of derivation (such as the original position)\nfor substantive principles of justice (Rawls 1999, 303\u201358).\nJustice is achieved only when an overlapping consensus among people\nmoved by deeply divergent but reasonable comprehensive moral views can\nbe attained, a consensus in which such citizens can affirm principles\nof justice from within those comprehensive views.\n\nPolitical Liberalism shifts the focus from a philosophical conception\nof justice, formulated abstractly and meant to apply universally, to a\npractical conception of legitimacy where consensus is reached without\npretension of deep metaphysical roots for the principles in question.\nMore than merely a \u201cmodus vivendi\u201d for the participating\nparties, justice must be affirmed in a way that finds a moral basis\nfor all participating citizens, albeit from different frameworks of\nvalue and moral obligation. The operation of public reason, then,\nserves as the means by which such a consensus might be established,\nand hence public discussion and democratic institutions must be seen\nas a constitutive part of the justification of principles of justice\nrather than merely a mechanism for the collective determination of the\nsocial good.\n\nBut the role of autonomy in the specification of this picture should\nnot be under- emphasized (or the controversies it invites ignored).\nFor such a consensus counts as legitimate only when achieved under\nconditions of free and authentic affirmation of shared principles.\nOnly if the citizens see themselves as fully able to reflectively\nendorse or reject such shared principles, and to do so competently and\nwith adequate information and range of options, can the overlapping\npolitical consensus step beyond the purely strategic dynamics of a\nmodus vivendi and ground legitimate institutions of political\npower.\n\nIndeed, the assumption that all those subject to political authority\nenjoy the developed capacity to reflectively accept their life path\nand the values inherent in it invokes a level of idealization that\nbelies the conditions of many victims of past and ongoing oppression.\nThis virtually ensures that such structural conditions of society as\nracial domination, profound inequality of power, and patterns of\nexclusion of groups from equal standing in social space will be\nassumed away as irrelevant to the question of legitimacy (Mills\n2005).\n\nTherefore, social conditions that hamper the equal enjoyment of\ncapacities to reflectively consider and (if necessary) reject\nprinciples of social justice, due, say, to extreme poverty,\ndisability, ongoing injustice and inequality, or the like, restrict\nthe establishment of just principles. Autonomy, then, insofar as that\nconcept picks out the free reflective choice operating in the\nestablishment of legitimacy, is basic to, and presupposed by, even\nsuch non-foundational (political) conceptions of justice.\n\nCritics of political liberalism arise from several quarters. However,\namong the objections to it that focus on autonomy are those that\nquestion whether a political conception of legitimacy that rests on\nshared values can be sustained without the validity of those values\nbeing seen as somehow objective or fundamental, a position that\nclashes with the purported pluralism of political liberalism.\nOtherwise, citizens with deeply conflicting worldviews could not be\nexpected to affirm the value of autonomy except as a mere modus\nvivendi (see, e.g., Wall 2009; cf. also Larmore 2008,\n146\u20136). A line of response to this worry that could be pursued\nwould be one that claimed that values that amount to autonomy (in some\nconceptualization of that idea) are already functional in the social\nstructures and cultural practices of otherwise defensible democratic\npractices (as well as some critical projects that emphasize oppression\nand domination, as we saw above). This point raises the issue, to\nwhich we now turn, of the connection between autonomy, political\nliberalism, and democracy.\n3.6 Autonomy, Justice and Democracy\n\nIn closing, we should add a word about the implications of political\nliberalism for the traditional division between liberal justice and\ndemocratic theory. I say \u201cdivision\u201d here, but different\nviews of justice and democracy will convey very different conceptions\nof the relation between the two (see Christiano 1996, Lakoff 1996).\nBut traditionally, liberal conceptions of justice have viewed\ndemocratic mechanisms of collective choice as essential but highly\ncircumscribed by the constitutional provisions that principles of\njustice support. Individual rights and freedoms, equality before the\nlaw, and various privileges and protections associated with citizen\nautonomy are protected by principles of justice and hence not subject\nto democratic review, on this approach (Gutmann 1993).\n\nHowever, liberal conceptions of justice have themselves evolved (in\nsome strains at least) to include reference to collective discussion\nand debate (public reason) among the constitutive conditions of\nlegitimacy. It could be claimed, then, that basic assumptions about\ncitizens\u2019 capacities for reflective deliberation and choice\n\u2014 autonomy \u2014 must be part of the background conditions\nagainst which an overlapping consensus or other sort of political\nagreement concerning principles of justice is to operate.\n\nSome thinkers have made the connection between individual or\n\u201cprivate\u201d autonomy and collective or \u201cpublic\u201d\nlegitimacy \u2014 prominent, most notably Habermas (Habermas 1994).\nOn this view, legitimacy and justice cannot be established in advance\nthrough philosophical construction and argument, as was thought to be\nthe case in natural law traditions in which classical social contract\ntheory flourished and which is inherited (in different form) in\ncontemporary perfectionist liberal views. Rather, justice amounts to\nthat set of principles that are established in practice and rendered\nlegitimate by the actual support of affected citizens (and\ntheir representatives) in a process of collective discourse and\ndeliberation (see e.g., Fraser 1997, 11\u201340 and Young 2000).\nSystems of rights and protections (private, individual autonomy) will\nnecessarily be protected in order to institutionalize frameworks of\npublic deliberation (and, more specifically, legislation and\nconstitutional interpretation) that render principles of social\njustice acceptable to all affected (in consultation with others)\n(Habermas 1994, 111).\n\nThis view of justice, if at all acceptable, provides an indirect\ndefense of the protection of autonomy and, in particular,\nconceptualizing autonomy in a way that assumes reflective self-\nevaluation. For only if citizen participants in the public discourse\nthat underlies justice are assumed to have (and provided the basic\nresources for having) capacities for competent self- reflection, can\nthe public defense and discussion of competing conceptions of justice\ntake place (cf. Gaus 1996, Parts II and III, Gaus 2011). Insofar as\nautonomy is necessary for a functioning democracy (considered very\nbroadly), and the latter is a constitutive element of just political\ninstitutions, then autonomy must be seen as reflective self-appraisal\n(and, I would add, non-alienation from central aspects of one\u2019s\nperson) (see Cohen 2002, Richardson 2003, Christman 2015).\n\nThis approach to justice and autonomy, spelled out here in rough and\ngeneral form, has certainly faced criticism. In particular, those\ntheorists concerned with the multi-dimensional nature of social and\ncultural \u201cdifference\u201d have stressed how the conception of\nthe autonomous person assumed in such principles (as well as criteria\nfor rational discourse and public deliberation) is a contestable ideal\nnot internalized by all participants in contemporary political life\n(see, e.g., Brown 1995, Benhabib 1992). Others motivated by\npost-modern considerations concerning the nature of the self,\nrationality, language, and identity, are also suspicious of the manner\nin which the basic concepts operative in liberal theories of justice\n(\u201cautonomy\u201d for example) are understood as fixed,\ntransparent, and without their own political presuppositions (see,\ne.g., Butler 1990; for general discussion see White 1990).\n\nThese charges are stated here much too generally to give an adequate\nresponse in this context. But the challenge remains for any theory of\njustice which rests on a presumption of the normative centrality of\nautonomy. To be plausible in a variously pluralistic social setting,\none marked by ongoing histories of oppressive practices and\ninstitutions, such a view must avoid the twin evils of forcibly\nimposing a (reasonably) contested value on resistant citizens, on the\none hand, and simply abandoning all normative conceptions of social\norder in favor of open ended struggle for power on the other. The view\nthat individuals ought to be treated as, and given the resources to\nbecome, autonomous in one of the minimal senses outlined here will, I\nsubmit, be a central element in any political view that steers between\nthe Scylla of oppressive forms of perfectionism and the Charybdis of\ninterest-group power politics.",
