    "main_text": "Case-Based Logical Pluralism\n1. Case-Based Logical Pluralism\n\nHow can two logics which disagree about which arguments are\nvalid both be correct? One way would be if there were more than\none property of validity (and so more than one interpretation of\n\u201cvalid\u201d) where one of the logics captures validity in one\nsense, while its rival captures validity in another. Some pluralists\nelaborate on this by maintaining that natural language expressions\nlike \u201cfollows from\u201d are unsettled, vague, or ambiguous,\nand may be settled, made more precise, or disambiguated, in more than\none way. The best-known version of this view is presented as the\nconjunction of two main theses (Beall & Restall 2006). First, the\nGeneralised Tarski Thesis:\n\n\nGeneralised Tarski Thesis (GTT):\n\nAn argument is \\(\\textrm{valid}_x\\) if and only if in every\n\\(\\textrm{case}_x\\) in which the premises are true, so is the\nconclusion.\n\n\nSecond, the thesis that the expression \u201c\\(\\textrm{case}_x\\)\u201d\nin the GTT can\nbe made more precise in at least two, equally acceptable, ways,\nresulting in different extensions for \u201cvalid\u201d. For\nexample, by \u201ccase\u201d we might mean a first-order model of\nthe kind used to define classical first-order consequence or instead\nwe might mean a possible situation. Other alternatives include\nincomplete or inconsistent models, of the sort used in the model\ntheory of intuitionistic and paraconsistent logics. Different choices\nfor the interpretation of \u201ccase\u201d will result in different\nprecisifications of the GTT analysis of logical consequence, which may\nin turn result in different consequence relations (Beall & Restall\n2006: 29\u201331). Call this view \u201cCase-Based Logical\nPluralism\u201d.\n\nCase-based pluralists do not need to hold that every conceivable\nprecisification of GTT defines a consequence relation. Beall and\nRestall, for example, think that the only admissible precisifications\nof the GTT yield relations with certain properties\u2014necessity,\nnormativity, and formality (Beall & Restall 2006: 26\u201335).\nHence having its extension given by a precisification of the GTT is\nonly a necessary condition on being a genuine consequence\nrelation.\n",
