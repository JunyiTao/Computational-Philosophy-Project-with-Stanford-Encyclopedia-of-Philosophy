    "main_text": "The Meaning of the Term Zen\n1. The Meaning of the Term Zen\n\nThe designation of this school of the Buddha-Way as Zen, which means\nsitting meditation, is derived from a transliteration of the Chinese\nword Ch\u00e1n. Because the Chinese term is in turn a\ntransliteration of the Sanskrit term dhy\u0101na, however,\nZen owes its historical origin to early Indian Buddhism, where a\ndeepened state of meditation, called sam\u0101dhi, was\nsingled out as one of the three components of study a Buddhist was\nrequired to master, the other two being an observation of ethical\nprecepts (s\u012bla) and an embodiment of nondiscriminatory\nwisdom (praj\u00f1\u0101). Meditation was\npicked as the name for this school because\nthe historical Buddha achieved enlightenment\n(nirv\u0101na) through the practice of meditation. In the\ncontext of Zen Buddhism, the perfection of nondiscriminatory wisdom\n(Jpn.: hannya haramitsu; Skrt.:\npraj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101) designates\npractical, experiential knowledge. Only secondarily and\nderivatively does it mean theoretical, intellectual knowledge. This\nis, Zen explains, because theoretical knowledge is a form of\n\u201clanguage game\u201d (Jpn.: keron;\nSkrt.: prapa\u00f1ca), i.e., discrimination through the use\nof language, constructed as it is at least in part on\ndistinction-making. Zen believes that theoretical\nreference ultimately carries no existential meaning for\nemancipating a human being from his or her predicaments, for it\nmaintains that discriminatory knowledge of any kind is\ndelusory/illusory in nature. To this effect it holds that it is\nthrough a practical transformation of the psychophysiological\nconstitution of one\u2019s being that one prepares for embodying\nnondiscriminatory wisdom. This preparation involves the training of\nthe whole person and is called \u201cself-cultivation\u201d\n(shugy\u014d) in Japanese. It is a practical method of\ncorrecting the modality of one\u2019s mind by correcting the modality\nof one\u2019s body, in which practice (pr\u0101xis) is given\nprecedence over theory (the\u014dria) (Yuasa, 1987).\n",
