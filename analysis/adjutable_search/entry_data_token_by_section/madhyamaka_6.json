    "main_text": "Candrak\u012brti\n5. Candrak\u012brti\n5.1 Life and works\n\nAs is usual for the majority of Indian philosophers, very little is\nknown about the life of Candrak\u012brti. Modern scholars place him at\nthe beginning of the seventh century. His two best-known works are his\ncommentary to MMK entitled Prasannapad\u0101\nMadhyamakav\u1e5btti (Clear-worded Commentary on Centrism),\nwhich survives in Sanskrit as well as in Tibetan translation, and an\nindependent treatise called Madhyamak\u0101vat\u0101ra\n(Introduction to Centrism) available only in Tibetan translation.\nMadhyamak\u0101vat\u0101ra is a verse text to which\nCandrak\u012brti provided a prose commentary. It is clearly an earlier\nwork than his commentary to MMK, since in that commentary he refers\nthe reader repeatedly to Madhyamak\u0101vat\u0101ra for the\nfull arguments for the positions he endorses. Both\nPrasannapad\u0101 and Madhyamak\u0101vat\u0101ra\nhave been studied by modern scholars and a significant number of\npassages have been translated into modern European languages. In\naddition to those works, Candrak\u012brti wrote a number of\ncommentaries to relatively short texts by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and\n\u0100ryadeva.\n5.2 Contributions\n\nAt the beginning of his commentary to MMK, Candrak\u012brti offers an\nextended criticism of Bh\u0101vaviveka and a defense of\nBuddhap\u0101lita against the criticisms of Bh\u0101vaviveka. Many\ncenturies after he wrote, Buddhist scholastics in Tibet portrayed\nCandrak\u012brti as the founder of one of the subschools of the\nMadhyamaka that they perceived. Because Bh\u0101vaviveka had advocated\nfor producing independent (svatantra) arguments for the view\nthat all phenomena are empty of inherent natures, the Tibetan\nscholastics dubbed his subschool the Sv\u0101tantrika school; because\nCandrak\u012brti criticized that approach and advocated for being\ncontent to show the unwelcome consequences (prasa\u1e45ga)\nof all possible positions on any given philosophical issue, his\nsubschool was named by Tibetans the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika school of\nMadhyamaka. Although those terms were not used by Indian\nM\u0101dhyamikas themselves, it has become standard practice in modern\nscholarship to portray the Madhyamaka school as comprising at least\ntwo subschools with those names and to see Bh\u0101vaviveka and\nCandrak\u012brti as the founders of those two subschools.\n\nThe earlier of Candrak\u012brti\u2019s two principal works,\nMadhyamak\u0101vat\u0101ra, has ten chapters, one for each of\nthe ten stages of the path of the bodhisattva. At each of these stages\nthe bodhisattva focuses attention on one of the virtues that are to be\nbrought to a stage of perfection (p\u0101ramit\u0101). The\nvirtues to be perfected are generosity; good habits of thought, word\nand deed; patience; courage; meditation; wisdom; proselytizing skill;\napplication of vows; strength of character; and transcendental\nknowledge. The chapter dedicated to the sixth stage, at which wisdom\nis cultivated to perfection, is the chapter in which Candrak\u012brti\nlays out his most detailed exposition of the Madhyamaka school of\nphilosophy. Candrak\u012brti begins this chapter with the claim that\nwisdom is like a sighted person who is capable of leading a group of\nblind people safely to a destination; similarly, wisdom guides all the\nother virtues to their destination of perfection. As for the content\nof wisdom, it is the realization that no phenomena come into being.\nPhenomena cannot arise from themselves, since that possibility would\nmake arising unnecessary or redundant; if a thing already exists, it\nhas no need to come into being. If, on the other hand, it were allowed\nthat one being might rise out of a being other than itself, then there\nwould be nothing to prevent one from saying that pitch darkness arises\nout of light. Another way of looking at the issue of production from\ncauses is that the effect either already exists in the cause or it\ndoes not exist. If it already exists, it has no need or coming into\nbeing. If it does not exist, then it cannot be an agent that does the\naction of coming into being; but if there is no agent, then there is\nno action.\n\nAfter showing that there cannot be any intelligible account of the\narising of phenomena, Candrak\u012brti acknowledges that in everyday\nexperience we encounter phenomena coming into being all the time. This\nleads to a discussion of the two truths. The ultimate truth\u2014that\nis, truth concerning the highest goal\u2014is that phenomena do not\ncome into being; the conventional transactional truth, on the other\nhand, is that things do come into being and that their arising is\nconditioned. This conventional truth can therefore be understood as a\nkind of screen, an obstacle that stands in the way of seeing the\nultimate truth. In other words, the putative truths of quotidian life\nare actually delusions that, if believed, prevent one from attaining\nthe wisdom that is capable of leading to the imperturbable peace of\nnirvana. The truth of the highest goal cannot be conveyed in language;\nit can only be manifested in silence. That notwithstanding, the Buddha\ngave many teachings in words, so how is one to understand that? The\nBuddha, said Candrak\u012brti, spoke according to the linguistic\nconventions of the people to whom he talked. It is conventional to use\npronouns such as \u201cI\u201d and \u201cyou\u201d and words like\n\u201cself\u201d; without such pronouns, grammatically correct\nsentences cannot be formed. It does not follow from grammatical\ncorrectness, however, that those words used in sentences have\nreferents. The Buddha\u2019s insight was that there is no self, and\nyet he used the sort of conventional language that is commonly used by\nthose who do believe that there is a self. Similarly, even though the\nBuddha realized that there are no phenomena coming into being and\nperishing, he spoke the same kinds of sentences used by those who\nbelieve that phenomena come into being through conditions and then\nperish when the conditions that sustain them are no longer operative.\nIf one is going to use language at all, then one cannot avoid using\nwords and constructions that apparently commit one to accepting the\npresuppositions upon which language rests. It is the task of the\nM\u0101dhyamika philosopher to expose those presuppositions as\nuntenable, to see that language is not grounded in realities but is\npurely conventional in nature. The Buddha, knowing what kinds of\nbeliefs his listeners had, gave doctrines that helped people get past\ntheir false beliefs. For example, to those who believed in an enduring\nand unified and essentially independent self, says Candrak\u012brti,\nthe Buddha taught that the self is not to be found in any of the\naspects of being human that might be a candidate for being regarded as\na self; he taught that the self is not the body, the personality,\nawareness, thoughts or feelings or anything else that arises through\ncauses and conditions, nor is there anything outside those things that\ncounts as a candidate for what people intuitively take to be their\nselves. To people who were inclined to a materialistic monism, the\nBuddha emphasized the importance of the mind as something that is\nindependent of the body. (About this, more will be said below.)\n\nAs was discussed above\n (section 4.2),\n Bh\u0101vaviveka criticized Buddhap\u0101lita for failing to state\nand defend the thesis of the M\u0101dhyamikas. In the first chapter of\nhis commentary to MMK, Candrak\u012brti comes to\nBuddhap\u0101lita\u2019s defense and offers a sustained criticism of\nBh\u0101vaviveka, and of the tradition of Dign\u0101ga on whom\nBh\u0101vaviveka had based much of his approach.\nBh\u0101vaviveka\u2019s call for an independent argument in favor of\na conclusion accepted by M\u0101dhyamikas, says Candrak\u012brti, is\ndiametrically opposed to what N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and \u0100ryadeva\nhad written. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna had written in VV that he has no\nthesis to advance. He had also written that he apprehends no objects\nat all and therefore has no need to affirm or deny anything, and since\nhe neither affirms nor denies any proposition, he need not supply any\nreasons to justify his stance. And \u0100ryadeva had written that a\nperson who makes no claims, either that anything exists or that\nsomething does not exist, cannot be refuted. Candrak\u012brti cites\nthose passages with the additional comment that Buddhap\u0101lita had\nunderstood the spirit of Madhyamaka as set forth by those early\nM\u0101dhyamikas. The M\u0101dhyamika, Candrak\u012brti goes on to\nexplain, does not put forward counter positions in opposition to the\nclaims of other philosophers; rather, he shows the problems involved\nin the positions of others and argues only until the other\nphilosophers realize the inadequacy of their positions and become\nsilent. In the process of bringing others to silence, the\nM\u0101dhyamika need not construct formal arguments, nor need he be\nconsistent in what he says. Following \u0100ryadeva\u2019s\nobservation, Candrak\u012brti says that the M\u0101dhyamika cannot be\nrefuted, precisely because he has no position to defend. If\nBuddhap\u0101lita had put forth arguments, then he would have opened\nhimself up to endless disputation; since, however, he knew that the\npurpose of Madhyamaka is to bring all disputation, and indeed all\nkinds of idle chatter, to an end, he wisely avoided putting forth\nformal arguments that a persistent opponent might take as an\ninvitation to debate. If Bh\u0101vaviveka had understood the point of\nMadhyamaka, concludes Candrak\u012brti, he would not have made the\ncriticisms he made of Buddhap\u0101lita.\n\nAfter offering his criticisms of Bh\u0101vaviveka, Candrak\u012brti\naddresses the school of Buddhist logic and epistemology founded by\nDign\u0101ga. The followers of this school did not present themselves\nas M\u0101dhyamikas, so Candrak\u012brti does not accuse them of\nhaving failed to understand N\u0101g\u0101rjuna properly. He does,\nhowever, confront them with having failed to supply a convincing\nresponse to the radical critique N\u0101g\u0101rjuna had made of the\nvery enterprise of grounding convictions on indisputable foundations.\nHe recapitulates a passage of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s VV in which\nit is said that any proposition that is supposed to be warranted must\nrest upon a foundation of either direct experience or one of three\nkinds of reasoning. But the very claim that a proposition is warranted\nby a foundation is itself a proposition, and as such it must either\nrequire a warrant of its own or be deemed self-validating. If it\nrequires a warrant of its own, the result will be an infinite regress\nof propositions needing warrants; if it is declared self-validating,\nthen why not say of all propositions they are self-validating?\nDign\u0101ga and his followers went ahead and talked about the\ngrounding of propositions as if N\u0101g\u0101rjuna had never\nquestioned the enterprise. Unless they provide a clear and convincing\nresponse to what N\u0101g\u0101rjuna said, there is no reason for\nanyone to take them seriously.\n\nOne further Buddhist movement that Candrak\u012brti criticizes is the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra school, which he presents as advocating a form of\nsubjective idealism. Their claim that the world of experience is\nconsciousness only and that the contents of consciousness cannot be\nobjects external to consciousness itself is supported by several texts\nwithin the Mah\u0101y\u0101na scriptural tradition. Candrak\u012brti\nexplains these scriptures as examples of teachings that the Buddha\ngave to counter a particular kind of commonly held wrong view. There\nare, says Candrak\u012brti, those who mistakenly believe that all\ntheir suffering is due to causes outside themselves; they see\nthemselves as unfortunate victims of a hostile world. The Buddha,\nwishing to make it clear that the predominant factor in\ndissatisfaction is the way one thinks about one\u2019s experiences,\nsaid, in effect \u201cIt\u2019s all in the mind.\u201d It would be\na mistake to take that statement literally and to conclude that\nnothing but consciousness exists and that the world of experience that\nfeels as though it is external to consciousness is in fact produced by\nconsciousness or is inseparable from consciousness. The\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra offers good reasons to show that the contents of\nconsciousness are conditioned and therefore are empty of inherent\nexistence, but they fail to appreciate that exactly the same can be\nsaid of awareness itself. In other words, says Candrak\u012brti, the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra philosophers fail to acknowledge that\neverything, including consciousness itself, is empty.\n\nIn making the kinds of criticisms of other philosophers that\nCandrak\u012brti makes, he repeatedly advocates for taking ordinary\nexperience seriously and at face value. In everyday experience, we\nfeel that things arise and perish because of causes and conditions,\nand we feel that we are conscious subjects on whom an external world\nis impinging. We communicate with one another in readily\ncomprehensible language. There is no reason to change any of that, no\nreason to replace everyday language with a more precise technical\nlanguage that helps avoid misrepresenting the nature of things. At the\nsame time, it is important to be aware that it cannot be shown that\nthings have fixed natures and that there is no reason to believe about\nany of our beliefs that they are grounded. The task of philosophy for\nCandrak\u012brti is not to replace unwarranted beliefs with justified\ntrue beliefs, but to break the habit of forming beliefs, declaring\nthem to be true, and then becoming attached to them.\n",
