    "main_text": "\n\nThe use of language is crucial to any legal system, not only in the\nsame way that it is crucial to politics in general, but also in two\nspecial respects. Lawmakers characteristically use language to make\nlaw, and law must provide for the authoritative resolution of disputes\nover the effects of that use of language. Political philosophers are\nnot generally preoccupied with questions in the philosophy of\nlanguage. But legal philosophers are political philosophers with a\nspecialization that gives language (and philosophy of language) a\nspecial\n importance.[1]\n\nPhilosophy of law can gain from a good philosophical account of the\nmeaning and use of language, and from a good philosophical account of\nthe institutionalized resolution of disputes over language. Philosophy\nof language can gain from studying the stress-testing of language in\nlegal regulation and dispute resolution. And philosophers of language\ncan gain from the reminder that their task is not only to account for\nwhat people share in virtue of the mastery of a language; they also\nneed to account for the possibility of disagreements over the meaning\nand use of language, and for the possibility that there might be good\nreason for resolving those disagreements in one way rather than\nanother.\n\nAfter a brief historical note on the linguistic preoccupations of\nlegal philosophers in section 1, section 2 outlines the relation\nbetween the law of a jurisdiction and the language with which law can\nbe made and in which it can be expressed. Section 3 surveys\nphilosophical work on the nature of law that rejects a preconception\nthat you can find in this introduction and in sections 1 and 2: that\nlaw can be made by the use of language. Section 4 addresses the\nimplications for legal philosophy of the widespread use of evaluative\nlanguage in law, and section 5 addresses the implications for legal\nphilosophy of the widespread use of vague language in law. Section 6\nconcludes with an assessment of philosophers\u2019 efforts to use\ninsights from the philosophy of language to address problems of the\nnature of law.\n",
