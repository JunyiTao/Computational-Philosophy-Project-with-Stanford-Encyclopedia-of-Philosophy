    "main_text": "Preserving Divine Transcendence While Avoiding Negative Theology || Dolezal\u2019s Mysterian Move\n4.3 Dolezal\u2019s Mysterian Move\n\nGod is the absolute. An absolute cannot lack anything nor does it have\nany need to develop itself: it is, eternally, all that it can be. This\nimplies that there is no act-potency distinction in God, no unrealized\npowers or potentialities. In the classical phrase, God is actus\npurus, pure act, wholly actual. James Dolezal puts it very well\nwhen he writes, \u201cThe consideration of God as ipsum esse\nsubsistens and actus purus is crucial for any confession\nof God\u2019s absolute existence\u201d (Dolezal 2011, 214).\n\nBut to uphold the divine absoluteness, it is also necessary that God\nbe libertarianly free in his production of creatures. He must be free\neither to create or not to create. For suppose that the divine nature\nis such that God must create. Then God would depend on the created\nworld to be himself and to be fully actual. He would need what is\nother than himself to be himself. This entanglement with the relative\nwould compromise the divine absoluteness. God would need the world as\nmuch as the world needs God. Each would require the other to be what\nit is. But then God would not be absolute (Dolezal, 210) Therefore,\nGod must be free to either create or not create\n\nSo God must be both simple and free to be absolute. But it is very\ndifficult to understand how a simple being could be free in the\nunconditional \u2018could have done otherwise\u2019 sense. If God is\nsimple, then he is pure act, as was explained at the beginning of this\nentry. It follows that God is devoid of unrealized powers,\npotentialities, or de re possibilities. To act freely,\nhowever is to act in such a way that one (unconditionally) could have\ndone otherwise, which implies unrealized possibilities of divine\naction. Now Dolezal\u2019s view is that it is not only difficult to\nreconcile simplicity and (libertarian) freedom, but impossible for us,\nat least in our present state. \u201cThough we discover strong\nreasons for confessing both simplicity and freedom in God, we cannot\nform an isomorphically adequate notion of how this is the case\u201d\n(210). In footnote 55 on the same page, Dolezal brings up\nwave-particle duality: light behaves both like a particle and like a\nwave. We have good reason to believe that it is both despite the\ndifficulty or impossibility of understanding how it could be both. On\nthe basis of the quotation and the footnote it seems fair to Dolezal\nto pin the label \u2018mysterian\u2019 on him, at least with respect\nto the simplicity-freedom problem which is only one sub-problem within\nthe divine simplicity constellation of problems. God is both simple\nand free, and he must be both to be God; it is a mystery, however, how\nhe could be both.\n\nIf we have good reason to believe that p is true, and good\nreason to believe that q is true, then we have good reason to\nbelieve that p and q are logically consistent (with\neach other) despite an absence of understanding as to how\nthey could be mutually consistent. What is actual is possible whether\nor not one can render intelligible how it is possible. For example,\nmotion is actual, hence possible, despite one\u2019s inability in the\nteeth of Zenonian considerations to understand how it is possible.\nMany similar examples could be given.\n\nAnd so a mysterian move suggests itself: We are justified in\nmaintaining both that God is simple and that God is free despite the\nfact that after protracted effort we cannot make logical sense of this\nconjunction. If we have good arguments for both limbs of what appears\nto be a logically contradictory dyad, it could be that the\ncontradiction is merely apparent. The fact that the conjunction\n\u2014 God is simple and God is free \u2014 appears to us, and\nperhaps even necessarily appears to us, to be or rather entail an\nexplicit logical contradiction is not a compelling reason to reject\nthe conjunction. It is a reason, perhaps even a good reason, but not a\nrationally compelling one. For it may be that our cognitive\narchitecture saddles us with irremediable cognitive limitations that\nmake it impossible for us to understand how God could be both simple\nand libertarianly free. The mysterian is not a dialetheist: the\nmysterian does not claim that there are true contradictions. Like the\nrest of us, the mysterian eschews them like the plague. The mysterian\npoint is rather that a proposition\u2019s non-episodic and chronic\nseeming to be a contradiction does not suffice for its rejection. For\nit may well be that certain truths are inaccessible to us due to our\nmental limitations and defects, and that among these truths are some\nthat appear to us only in the guise of contradictions, and must so\nappear in this life. The religious mysterian can bolster the point by\nreferencing the Fall. Sin, after all, may be expected to have noetic\nconsequences. Of course, Dolezal\u2019s mysterian move cannot be\nreasonably made unless the extant attempts to reconcile simplicity and\nfreedom are failures. That they are failures is not difficult to\nbelieve. So mysterianism is up and running despite its own problems.\nWhat might these be?\n\nFirst, if a (conjunctive) proposition\u2019s seeming, after careful\nand repeated scrutiny, to be or entail an explicit logical\ncontradiction is not sufficient, or at least good enough, evidence of\nits being a contradiction, what would be? To put it another way,\none\u2019s inability to explain how it could be true both that\np and that q does seem to be pretty good\n(non-demonstrative) evidence that p and q are not\nboth true. Now it was noted above that the actual is possible whether\nor not one can explain how it is possible. Granted, but if one cannot\nexplain the \u2018how,\u2019 doubt is cast on the actuality. The\ntables can be turned. How adjudicate between these opposing lines of\nargument: A: Because X is actual, X is possible,\nwhether or not anyone can explain how it is possible! B: Because no\none can explain how it is possible, it is not possible, and therefore\nnot actual!\n\nSecond, if all extant attempts to reconcile simplicity and freedom\nfail, it does not follow that there isn\u2019t a solution right over\nthe horizon. How can a mysterian rule out the possibility of a future\nsolution? The mysterian seems committed to saying that it is\nimpossible (at least in this life) that there be a solution. How can\nhe be sure of this?\n\nThird, if a proposition appears under careful scrutiny to be or entail\na contradiction, then is there even a proposition before the mind? If\nyou require for x\u2019s salvation that x believe\nthat God is one and God is three, what exactly are you demanding that\nx believe? Before x can affirm a proposition as true\nx must understand it, but how can x affirm as true a\nproposition that appears necessarily false? Such a\n\u2018proposition\u2019 is arguably not a proposition at all.\nGod is simple but free appears to be in like case. As a\nmatter of pure logic, there are of course necessarily false\npropositions: take the members of a contradictory pair of propositions\nand conjoin them, e.g., snow is white & snow is not\nwhite. This necessarily false proposition is arguably not a\npossible object of belief because of our charitable tendency to\nre-interpret blatant contradictions in some innocuous way. When our\nhermeneutical charity is thwarted, however, we suspend belief, not in\na proposition, but in a putative proposition\u2019s being a\nproposition, or in a verbal formula\u2019s expressing a\nproposition.\n",
