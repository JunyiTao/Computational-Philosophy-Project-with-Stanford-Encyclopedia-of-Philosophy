    "main_text": "Logic || Modal Logic of Agency\n3.3 Modal Logic of Agency\n\nAs an idealist philosopher, Royce entered the study of logic (with\nother idealists of his time) interested in the operations of the will\nand the formalization of judgment. The central operation in judgment\nis the selection of one alternative and the rejection of others. In\nthe debates about the central logical operations that emerged in the\n1890s and early 20th century, realist philosophers argued\nagainst founding logic on the basic relation that emerges in\njudgments. Rather, they argued in favor of using the inclusive\ndisjunction as the starting point. The reason given for this\nalternative was that the inclusive disjunction provided a better model\nfor the logic of burgeoning empirical science in two ways. First, it\nbegan with objects already in existence that can be put in relation to\nother already existing objects. Second, the exclusive disjunction\nrequires the recognition of objects that do not exist in the ordinary\nsense (negated objects, for example). When the debates ended with the\nstart of World War One, the realist logicians held the field and\nRoyce\u2019s alternative (and the work of other idealist logicians)\nfaded from view.\n\nRoyce\u2019s development of system \\(\\Sigma\\) occurred before modal\nlogic was formalized. While Royce uses the language of necessity and\npossibility in his discussion of logic, his system has no formal place\nfor it. In fact, his student, C. I. Lewis, seeing the need to account\nfor modal operators in understanding the conditionals of logic,\nproposed the first modal system in 1918, two years after Royce\u2019s\ndeath. Lewis\u2019s introduction of the strict conditional as a means\nof correcting Russell and Whitehead\u2019s material conditional\nsystem required the introduction of modal operators to serve, in\neffect, as the parameter needed to connect the antecedent and\nconsequent of conditionals (Pratt 2007).\n\nRoyce\u2019s project was framed as one fundamentally concerned with\naction as he observed in a 1906 paper. \u201c[T]he fundamental\nlogical relations,\u201d he wrote, \u201care characteristic not only\nof our world of thought, but also of our world of action. For\nwill-acts involve acceptance and refusal, affirmation and negation, a\nconsciousness of consequences, a facing of alternatives, a union of\nvarious acts in one act; so that the logic of action is in form\nprecisely the same as the logic of abstract thought\u201d (1906,\n100). From this perspective, Royce observed in an unpublished lecture\nfrom 1905, \u201cThere is a fundamental relation which may be called\nthe logical relation par excellence. It is the relation between\n\u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019, the relation which\ncharacterizes two mutually exclusive alternatives, that together\nexhaust all the possibilities. It is the relation that one faces, when\none has a choice to make. It is also the relation that obtains between\nany logical class and the negative of that class\u201d (1905a, 6).\nThe \\(O\\)-relation then marks both necessity and\npossibility (that is, it marks a necessary relation between\n\u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 and it exhausts the\npossibilities). As I observed earlier, the \\(O\\)-relation\ncan be captured in modern modal logic by\nrepresenting it as the conjunction of two conditionals such that\n\\(O(A\\: B)\\) is \\(\\Box (A \\equiv \\neg B)\\). Although not founded as a\nmodal logic, system \\(\\Sigma\\) is modal in its operations and so\npotentially formalizable in modal terms.\n",
