    "main_text": "Further Issues || SM Beyond Physics\n7.5 Reductionism and Inter-Theory Relations\n\nIn the introduction we said that SM had to account for the\nthermodynamic behaviour of physical systems like gases in a box. This\nis a minimal aim that everybody can agree on. But many would go\nfurther and say that there must be stronger reductive relations\nbetween SM and other parts of science, or, indeed, as in the\nMentaculs, that all layers of reality in the entire universe reduce to\nSM. For a general discussion of reductionism and inter-theory\nrelations see the relevant entries in this encyclopaedia\n (scientific reduction\n and\n intertheory relations in physics).\n\nA point where the issue of reduction has come to head is the\ndiscussion of phase transitions. Consider again a container full of\ngas and imagine that the container is over 100\u00b0C hot and that the\ngas in it is water vapour. Now you start cooling down the container.\nOnce the temperature of the gas falls below 100\u00b0C, the gas\ncondenses and turns in liquid water, and once it falls below 0\u00b0C,\nliquid water turns into solid ice. These are examples of phase\ntransitions, namely, first from the gaseous phase to the liquid\nphase and then from the liquid to the solid phase. Thermodynamics\ncharacterises phase transitions as a discontinuity in a thermodynamic\npotential such as the free energy, and a phase transition is said to\noccur when this potential shows a discontinuity (Callender 2001). It\nnow turns out that SM can reproduce this only in the so-called\nthermodynamic limit, which takes the particle number in the system\ntoward infinity (while keeping the number of particles per volume\nconstant). This would seem to imply that phase transitions can only\noccur in infinite systems. In this vein, physicist David Ruelle notes\nthat phase transitions can occur only in systems that are\n\u201cidealized to be actually infinite\u201d (Ruelle 2004: 2). This\nis sparked a heated debate over whether, and if so in what sense,\nthermodynamics can be reduced to SM, because in nature phase\ntransitions clearly do occur in finite systems (the water in a puddle\nfreezes!). Batterman (2002) draws the conclusion that phase\ntransitions are emergent phenomena that are irreducible to\nthe underling micro-theory, namely SM. Others push back against this\nview and argue that no actual infinity is needed and that therefore\nlimiting behaviour is neither emergent not indicative of a failure of\nreduction. Norton (2012) reaches this conclusion by demoting the limit\nto a mere approximation, Callender (2001) by counselling against\n\u201ctaking thermodynamics too seriously\u201d, and Butterfield by\ndeveloping a view that reconciles reduction and emergence (2011a,\n2011b, 2014). For further discussions of phase transitions and their\nrole in understanding whether, and if so how, thermodynamics can be\nreduced to SM see, Ardourel (2018), Bangu (2009), Butterfield and\nBuatta (2012), Franklin (2018), Liu (2001), Palacios (2018, 2019,\nforthcoming), and Menon and Callender (2013), and for a discussion of\ninfinite idealisations in general Shech (2018).\n\nSimilar questions arise when we aim to reduce the thermodynamic\nentropy to one of the SM entropies (Callender 1999; Dizadji-Bahmani et\nal. 2010; Myrvold 2011), when we focus on the peculiar nature of\nquasi-static processes in thermodynamics (Robertson forthcoming), when\nwe study equilibration Myrvold (2020a), and when we give up the\nidealisation that SM systems are isolated and take gravity into\naccount (Callender 2011). There is also a question about what exactly\nreduction is expected to achieve. Radical reductionists seem to expect\nthat once the fundamental level is sorted out, the rest of science\nfollows from it as a corollary (Weinberg 1992), which is also a vision\nthat seems to drive the Mentaculus. Others are more cautions. Lavis,\nK\u00fchn, and Frigg (2021) and Yi (2003) note that even if reduction\nis successful, thermodynamics remains in place as an independent\ntheory: SM requires the framework of thermodynamics, which serves as\nrecipient of information from SM but without itself being derivable\nfrom SM.\n",
