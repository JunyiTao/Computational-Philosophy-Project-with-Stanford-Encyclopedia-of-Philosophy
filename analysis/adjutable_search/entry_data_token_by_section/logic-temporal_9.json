In fact, in the early days of temporal\nlogic, Prior\u2019s approach was perceived as a rival to more\nconventional approaches using first-order logic. The rivalry between\ntense logic and first-order logic can be seen as reflecting a\nfundamental distinction concerning the nature of time, namely the\ndistinction between the A-series and the B-series of time introduced\nby McTaggart (1908).\n\nThe A-series essentially amounts to a characterization of time and\ntemporal order in terms of past, present, and future. The B-series, in\ncontrast, is based on the notions \u2018earlier\u2019 and\n\u2018later\u2019. Thus, whereas the A-series presupposes a\ndistinguished present, the B-series involves an overarching, global\nperspective on time. McTaggart argued that the B-series is\ninsufficient because it lacks an appropriate notion of change, and he\nrejected the A-series as inconsistent because what is future now will\nbe past, which, according to him, requires that one and the same time\ninstant has incompatible properties. From this he concluded that time\nis unreal. For a detailed discussion of McTaggart\u2019s account and\nits philosophical relevance, see Ingthorsson (2016) and the entry on\n time.\n\nThere is a close correspondence between the A-series of time and tense\nlogic, on the one hand, and between the B-series and first-order\nlogic, on the other, as was already noted by Prior (1967, Chapter 1)\nhimself. Consider, for example, the sentence \u201cIt is dark, it was\nlight, and it will be light again.\u201d This sentence can be\nformalized in TL as \n\n\\[\\mathsf{dark} \\wedge P(\\mathsf{light}) \\wedge F(\\mathsf{light})\\] \n\nwhile its first-order formulation reads \n\n\\[\\mathsf{dark}(t_1) \\wedge \\exists t_0 (t_0 \\prec t_1 \\wedge \\mathsf{light}(t_0)) \\wedge \\exists t_2 (t_1 \\prec t_2 \\wedge \\mathsf{light}(t_2)).\\] \n\n The TL formula consists of tensed propositions\n(propositions not containing temporal operators are present tensed),\nand it invokes the local perspective of the present. In the\nfirst-order formula, in contrast, propositions are untensed or\ntenseless. Here we are provided with predicates of time instants\nrather than with tenses, and the perspective involved is a global\nperspective from outside of time. Prior felt that not everything that\ncan be expressed in a tensed language can likewise be expressed in a\ntenseless one, his classic example being: \u201cThank goodness,\nthat\u2019s over!\u201d (Prior 1959).\n",
