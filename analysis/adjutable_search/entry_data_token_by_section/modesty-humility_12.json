On these views, it is a way of valuing and\npromoting the wellbeing of others. These views make modesty not merely\na trait of an individual, but deeply social in nature. So Woodcock\n(2008) sees modesty as about balancing one\u2019s own welfare with the\nwelfare of others. Wilson (2014) describes it as a type of kindness, a\nsensitivity to the well-being of others when presenting our own good\nqualities. Sinha (2012, 261) makes a similar claim about humility\ndescribing \u201cpublic humility\u201d as not claiming credit out of\nconcern for the feelings of others.\n\n\nIn addition to making modesty or humility more strongly social in\nnature, these accounts make modesty compatible with epistemic defects\nbut do not require them. One can exhibit the kindness and concern for\nothers these accounts associate with modesty regardless of the accuracy\nof one\u2019s self-assessments.\n",
