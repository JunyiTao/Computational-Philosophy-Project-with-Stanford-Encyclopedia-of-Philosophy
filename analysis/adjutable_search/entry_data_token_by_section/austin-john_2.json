    "main_text": "Austin\u2019s Views\n3. Austin\u2019s Views\n\nAustin\u2019s basic approach was to ascertain what can be said\ngenerally, but still with interest, about all laws. Austin\u2019s\nanalysis can be seen as either a paradigm of, or a caricature of,\nanalytical philosophy, in that his discussions are dryly full of\ndistinctions, but are thin in argument. The modern reader is forced to\nfill in much of the meta-theoretical, justificatory work, as it cannot\nbe found in the text. Where Austin does articulate his methodology and\nobjective, it is a fairly traditional one: he \u201cendeavored to\nresolve a law (taken with the largest signification which can\nbe given to that term properly) into the necessary and\nessential elements of which it is composed\u201d (Austin 1832:\nLecture V, p. 117).\n\nAs to what is the core nature of law, Austin\u2019s answer is that\nlaws (\u201cproperly so called\u201d) are commands of a sovereign.\nHe clarifies the concept of positive law (that is, man-made law) by\nanalyzing the constituent concepts of his definition, and by\ndistinguishing law from other concepts that are similar:\n\n\n\n\u201cCommands\u201d involve an expressed wish that something be\ndone, combined with a willingness and ability to impose \u201can\nevil\u201d if that wish is not complied with. \n\n\nRules are general commands (applying generally to a class), as\ncontrasted with specific or individual commands (\u201cdrink wine\ntoday\u201d or \u201cJohn Major must drink wine\u201d). \n\n\nPositive law consists of those commands laid down by a sovereign (or\nits agents), to be contrasted to other law-givers, like God\u2019s\ngeneral commands, and the general commands of an employer to an\nemployee. \n\n\nThe \u201csovereign\u201d is defined as a person (or determinate\nbody of persons) who receives habitual obedience from the bulk of the\npopulation, but who does not habitually obey any other (earthly)\nperson or institution. Austin thought that all independent political\nsocieties, by their nature, have a sovereign. \n\n\nPositive law should also be contrasted with \u201claws by a close\nanalogy\u201d (which includes positive morality, laws of honor,\ninternational law, customary law, and constitutional law) and\n\u201claws by remote analogy\u201d (e.g., the laws of physics).\n\n(Austin 1832: Lecture I). \n\n\nAustin also included within \u201cthe province of\njurisprudence\u201d certain \u201cexceptions,\u201d items which did\nnot fit his criteria but which should nonetheless be studied with\nother \u201claws properly so called\u201d: repealing laws,\ndeclarative laws, and \u201cimperfect laws\u201d\u2014laws\nprescribing action but without sanctions (a concept Austin ascribes to\n\u201cRoman [law] jurists\u201d) (Austin 1832: Lecture I, p.\n36).\n\nIn the criteria set out above, Austin succeeded in delimiting law and\nlegal rules from religion, morality, convention, and custom. However,\nalso excluded from \u201cthe province of jurisprudence\u201d were\ncustomary law (except to the extent that the sovereign had, directly\nor indirectly, adopted such customs as law), public international law,\nand parts of constitutional law. (These exclusions alone would make\nAustin\u2019s theory problematic for most modern readers.)\n\nWithin Austin\u2019s approach, whether something is or is not\n\u201claw\u201d depends on which people have done what: the question\nturns on an empirical investigation, and it is a matter mostly of\npower, not of morality. Of course, Austin is not arguing that law\nshould not be moral, nor is he implying that it rarely is. Austin is\nnot playing the nihilist or the skeptic. He is merely pointing out\nthat there is much that is law that is not moral, and what makes\nsomething law does nothing to guarantee its moral value. \u201cThe\nmost pernicious laws, and therefore those which are most opposed to\nthe will of God, have been and are continually enforced as laws by\njudicial tribunals\u201d (Austin 1832: Lecture V, p. 158).\n\nIn contrast to his mentor Bentham, Austin, in his early lectures,\naccepted judicial lawmaking as \u201chighly beneficial and even\nabsolutely necessary\u201d (Austin, 1832: Lecture V, p. 163). Nor did\nAustin find any difficulty incorporating judicial lawmaking into his\ncommand theory: he characterized that form of lawmaking, along with\nthe occasional legal/judicial recognition of customs by judges, as the\n\u201ctacit commands\u201d of the sovereign, the sovereign\u2019s\naffirming the \u201corders\u201d by its acquiescence (Austin 1832:\nLecture 1, pp. 35\u201336). It should be noted, however, that one of\nAustin\u2019s later lectures listed the many problems that can come\nwith judicial legislation, and recommended codification of the law\ninstead (Austin 1879: vol. 2, Lecture XXXIX, pp. 669\u2013704).\n",
