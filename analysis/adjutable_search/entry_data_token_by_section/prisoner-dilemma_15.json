    "main_text": "Evolution\n16. Evolution\n\nPerhaps the most active area of research on the PD concerns\nevolutionary versions of the game. A population of players employing\nvarious strategies play IPDs among themselves. The lower scoring\nstrategies decrease in number, the higher scoring increase, and the\nprocess is repeated. Thus success in an evolutionary PD (henceforth\nEPD), requires doing well with other successful strategies, rather\nthan doing well with a wide range of strategies.\n\nThe initial population in an EPD can be represented by a set of pairs\n\\(\\{(p_1, s_1), \\ldots (p_n, s_n)\\}\\) where \\(p_1 \\ldots p_n\\) are the\nproportions of the population playing strategies \\(\\bs_1, \\ldots,\n\\bs_n\\), respectively. The description of EPDs given above does not\nspecify exactly how the population of strategies is to be\nreconstituted after each IPD. The usual assumption, and the most\nsensible one for biological applications, is that a score in any round\nindicates the relative number of \u201coffspring\u201d in the next.\nIt is assumed that the size of the entire population stays fixed, so\nthat births of more successful strategies are exactly offset by deaths\nof less successful ones. This amounts to the condition that the\nproportion \\(p_i^*\\) of each strategy \\(s_i\\) in the successor\npopulation is determined by the equation \\(p_i^* = p_i(V_i / V)\\),\nwhere \\(V_i\\) is the score of \\(s_i\\) in the previous round and \\(V\\)\nis the average of all scores in the population. Thus every strategy\nthat scores above the population average will increase in number and\nevery one that scores below the average will decrease. This kind of\nevolution is referred to as \u201creplicator dynamics\u201d or\nevolution according to the \u201cproportional fitness\u201d rule.\nOther rules of evolution are possible. Bendor and Swistak argue that,\nfor social applications, it makes more sense to think of the players\nas switching from one strategy to another rather than as coming into\nand of existence. Since rational players would presumably switch only\nto strategies that received the highest payoff in previous rounds,\nonly the highest scoring strategies would increase in numbers. Batali\nand Kitcher employ a dynamics in which lowest scoring strategies are\nreplaced by strategies that mix characteristics of the highest scoring\nstrategies. A variety of other possible evolutionary dynamics are\ndescribed and compared in Kuhn 2004. Discussion here, however, will\nprimarily concern EPDs with the proportional fitness rule.\n\nAxelrod, borrowing from Trivers and Maynard Smith, includes a\ndescription of the EPD with proportional fitness, and a brief analysis\nof the evolutionary version of his IPD tournament. For Axelrod, the\nEPD provides one more piece of evidence in favor of\nTFT:\n\nTIT FOR TAT had a very slight lead in the original tournament, and\nnever lost this lead in simulated generations. By the one-thousandth\ngeneration it was the most successful rule and still growing at a\nfaster rate than any other rule.\n\n\nAxelrod's EPD tournament, however, incorporated several features that\nmight be deemed artificial. First, it permitted deterministic\nstrategies in a noise-free environment. As noted above,\nTFT can be expected to do worse under conditions that\nmodel the inevitability of error. Second, it began with only the 63\nstrategies from the original IPD tournament. Success against\nstrategies concocted in the ivory tower may not imply success against\nall those that might be found in nature. Third, the only strategies\npermitted to compete at a given stage were the survivors from the\nprevious stage. A more realistic model, one might argue, would allow\nnew \u201cmutant\u201d strategies to enter the game at any stage.\nChanging this third feature might well be expected to hurt\nTFT. For a large growth in the TFT\npopulation would make it possible for mutants employing more naive\nstrategies like \\(\\bCu\\) to regain a foothold, and the presence of\nthese naifs in the population might favor nastier strategies like\n\\(\\bDu\\) over TFT.\n\nNowak and Sigmund simulated two kinds of tournaments that avoid the\nthree questionable features. The first examined the family of\n\u201creactive\u201d strategies. For any probabilities \\(y\\), \\(p\\),\nand \\(q\\), \\(\\bR(y,p,q)\\) is the strategy of cooperating with\nprobability \\(y\\) in the first round and thereafter with probability\n\\(p\\) if the other player has cooperated in the previous round, and\nwith probability \\(q\\) if she has defected. This is a broad family,\nincluding many of the strategies already considered. \\(\\bCu\\),\n\\(\\bDu\\), TFT, and Cp are\n\\(\\bR(1,1,1)\\), \\(\\bR(0,0,0)\\), \\(\\bR(1,1,0)\\), and \\(\\bR(p,p,p)\\).\nGTFT, when payoffs are \\(5,3,1,0\\), is\n\\(\\bR(1,1,.25)\\). To capture the inevitability of error, Nowak and\nSigmund exclude the deterministic strategies, where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\)\nare exactly \\(1\\) or \\(0\\), from their tournaments. As before, if the\ngame is sufficiently long (and \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are not integers), the\nfirst move can be ignored and a reactive strategy can be identified\nwith its \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) values. Particular attention is paid to the\nstrategies close to Molander's GTFT described above,\nwhere \\(p=1\\) and \\(q = \\min \\{1-(T-R)/(R-S), (R-P)/(T-P)\\}\\). The\nfirst series of Nowak and Sigmund's EPD tournaments begin with\nrepresentative samples of reactive strategies. For most such\ntournaments, they found that evolution led irreversibly to \\(\\bDu\\).\nThose strategies \\(\\bR(p,q)\\) closest to \\(\\bR(0,0)\\) thrived while\nthe others perished. When one of the initial strategies is very close\nto TFT, however, the outcome changes.\n\nTFT and all other reciprocating strategies (near \\((1,0)\\)) seem to\nhave disappeared. But an embattled minority remains and fights back.\nThe tide turns when \u2018suckers\u2019 are so decimated that\nexploiters can no longer feed on them. Slowly at first, but gathering\nmomentum, the reciprocators come back, and the exploiters now wane.\nBut the TFT-like strategy that caused this reversal\nof fortune is not going to profit from it: having eliminated the\nexploiters, it is robbed of its mission and superseded by the strategy\nclosest to GTFT. Evolution then stops. Even if we\nintroduce occasionally 1% of another strategy it will vanish.\n\n\nOn the basis of their tournaments among reactive strategies, Nowak and\nSigmund conjectured that, while TFT is essential for\nthe emergence of cooperation, the strategy that actually underlies\npersistent patterns of cooperation in the biological world is more\nlikely to be GTFT.\n\nA second series of simulations with a wider class of strategies,\nhowever, forced them to revise their opinion. The strategies\nconsidered in the second series allowed each player to base its\nprobability of cooperation on its own previous move as well as its\nopponent's. A strategy can now be represented as \\(\\bS(p_1, p_2. p_3,\np_4)\\) where \\(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4\\) are the probabilities of\ncooperating after outcomes \\((\\bC, \\bC)\\), \\((\\bC, \\bD)\\), \\((\\bD,\n\\bC)\\), and \\((\\bD, \\bD)\\), respectively i.e., after receiving the\nreward, sucker, temptation and punishment payoffs. (Again, we can\nignore the probability of defecting on the first move as long as the\n\\(p_i\\) s are not zero or one.) The initial population in these\ntournaments all play the random strategy \\(\\bS(.5, .5, .5, .5)\\) and\nafter every 100 generations a small amount of a randomly chosen\n(non-deterministic) mutant is introduced, and the population evolves\nby proportional fitness. The results are quite different than before.\nAfter \\(10^7\\) generations, a state of steady mutual cooperation was\nreached in \\(90\\%\\) of the simulation trials. But less than \\(8.3\\%\\)\nof these states were populated by players using TFT\nor GTFT. The remaining \\(91.7\\%\\) were dominated by\nstrategies close to \\(\\bS(1,0,0,1)\\). This is the just the Pavlovian\nstrategy \\(\\bP_1\\) of Kraines and Kraines, which replays its last move\nafter receiving \\(R\\) or \\(T\\) and changes to the other move after\nreceiving \\(P\\) or \\(S\\). Kraines and Kraines had been somewhat\ndismissive of \\(\\bP_1\\). They recall that Rapoport and Chammah, who\nidentified it early in the history of game theory had labeled it\n\u201csimpleton\u201d and remark that \u201cthe appellation is well\ndeserved\u201d. Indeed, \\(\\bP_1\\) has the unfortunate characteristic\nof trying to cooperate with \\(\\bDu\\) on every other turn, and against\nTFT it can get locked into the inferior repeating\nseries of payoffs \\(T, P, S, T, P, S, \\ldots\\). But Nowak and Sigmund\nrename the strategy \u201cwin-stay lose-shift\u201d and trumpet its\nadvantages. Their simulations suggest that the defects mentioned here\ndo not matter very much in evolutionary contexts. One reason may be\nthat \\(\\bP_1\\) helps to make its environment unsuitable for its\nenemies. \\(\\bDu\\) does well in an environment with generous\nstrategies, like \\(\\bCu\\) or GTFT.\nTFT, as we have seen, allows these strategies to\nflourish, which could pave the way for \\(\\bDu\\). Thus, although\nTFT fares less badly against \\(\\bDu\\) than \\(\\bP_1\\)\ndoes, \\(\\bP_1\\) is better at keeping its environment free of\n\\(\\bDu\\).\n\nSimulations in a universe of deterministic strategies yield results\nquite different than those of Nowak and Sigmund. Bruce Linster (1992\nand 1994) suggests that natural classes of strategies and realistic\nmechanisms of evolution can be defined by representing strategies as\nsimple Moore machines. For example, \\(\\bP_1\\) is represented\nby the machine pictured below.\n\n\n\nFigure 8\n\n\nThis machine has two states, indicated by circles. It begins in the\nleftmost state. The \\(\\bC\\) in the left circle means that the machine\ncooperates on the first move. The arrow leading from the left to the\nright circle indicates that machine defects (enters the \\(\\bD\\)) after\nit has cooperated (been in the \\(\\bC\\) state) and its opponent has\ndefected (the arrow is labeled by \\(d\\)). Linster has conducted\nsimulations of evolutionary PD's among the strategies that can be\nrepresented by two-state Moore machines. It turns out that these are\nexactly the deterministic versions of the \\(\\bS\\) strategies of Nowak\nand Sigmund. Since the strategies are deterministic, we must\ndistinguish between the versions that cooperate on the first round and\nthose that defect on the first round. Among the first round\ncooperators, \\(\\bS(1,1,1,1), \\bS(1,1,1,0), \\bS(1,1,0,1)\\) and\n\\(\\bS(1,1,0,0)\\) all represent the strategy \\(\\bCu\\) of unconditional\ncooperation. Similarly, four of the first-round defectors all\nrepresent \\(\\bDu\\). Each of the other \\(\\bS(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4)\\),\nwhere \\(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4\\) are either zero or one represent unique\nstrategies, and each comes in two varieties according to whether it\ncooperates or defects in round one. By deleting the six duplicates\nfrom these thirty-two deterministic versions of Nowak and Sigmund's\nstrategies, we obtain the twenty-six \u201ctwo-state\u201d\nstrategies considered by Linster.\n\nLinster simulated a variety of EPD tournaments among the two-state\nstrategies. Some used \u201cuniform mutation\u201d in which each\nstrategy in the population has an equal probability \\(m\\) of mutating\ninto any of the other strategies. Some used \u201cstylized\nmutation\u201d in which the only mutations permitted are those that\ncan be understood as the result of a single \u201cbroken link\u201d\nin the Moore machine diagrams. In some, mutations were assumed to\noccur to a tiny proportion of the population at each generation; in\nothers the \u201cmutants\u201d represented an invading force\namounting to one percent of the original population. In some, a\npenalty was levied for increased complexity in the form of reduced\npayoffs for machines requiring more states or more links. As one might\nexpect, results vary somewhat depending on conditions. There are some\nstriking differences, however, between all of Linster's results and\nthose of Nowak and Sigmund. In Linster's tournaments, no single\nstrategy ever dominated the surviving populations in the way that\n\\(\\bP_1\\) and GTFT did in Nowak and Sigmund's. The\none strategy that did generally come to comprise over fifty percent of\nthe population was the initially-cooperating version of\n\\(\\bS(1,0,0,0)\\). This is a strategy whose imperfect variants seem to\nhave been remarkably uncompetitive for Nowak and Sigmund. It has been\nfrequently discussed in the game theory literature under the label\nGRIM or TRIGGER. It cooperates until\nits opponent has defected once, and then defects for the rest of the\ngame. According to Skyrms (1998) and Vanderschraaf, both Hobbes and\nHume identified it as the strategy that underlies our cooperative\nbehavior in important PD-like situations. The explanation for the\ndiscrepancy between GRIM's strong performance for\nLinster and its poor performance for Nowak and Sigmund probably has to\ndo with its sharp deterioration in the presence of error. In a match\nbetween two imperfect GRIMs, an\n\u201cerronious\u201d defection by either leads to a long string of\nmutual defections. Thus, in the long run imperfect\nGRIM does poorly against itself. The other strategies\nthat survived (in lesser numbers) Linster's tournaments are\nTFT, \\(\\bP_1\\), \\(\\bCu\\), and the\ninitially-cooperative \\(\\bS(1,0,1,1)\\). (Note that imperfect\nGRIM is also likely to do poorly against imperfect\nversions of these.) The observation that evolution might lead to a\nstable mix of strategies (perhaps each serving to protect others\nagainst particular types of invaders) rather than a single dominant\nstrategy is suggestive. Equally suggestive is the result obtained\nunder a few special conditions in which evolution leads to a recurring\ncycle of population mixes.\n\nOne might expect it to be possible to predict the strategies that will\nprevail in EPDs meeting various conditions, and to justify such\npredictions by formal proofs. Until recently, however, mathematical\nanalyses of the EPD have been plagued by conceptual confusions about\n\u201cevolutionary stability,\u201d the condition under which, as\nNowak and Sigmund say, \u201cevolution stops\u201d. Axelrod and\nAxelrod & Hamilton claim to show that TFT is\nevolutionarily stable. Selten 1983, includes an example of a game with\nno evolutionarily stable strategy, and Selten's argument that there is\nno such strategy clearly applies to the EPD and other\nevolutionary games. Boyd and Lorberbaum and Farrell and Ware present\nstill different proofs demonstrating that no strategies for the\nEPD are evolutionarily stable. Unsurprisingly, the\nparadox is resolved by observing that the three groups of authors each\nemploy slightly different conceptions of evolutionary stability. The\nconceptual tangle is unraveled in a series of papers by Bendor and\nSwistak. Two central stability concepts are described and applied to\nthe EPD below. Readers who wish to compare these with some others that\nappear in the literature may consult the following brief guide:\n\nConcepts of Stability in Evolutionary Games.\n \n\nA strategy \\(\\bs\\) for an evolutionary game has universal strong\nnarrow stability (\u201cusn-stability\u201d) if a population\nplaying strategy \\(\\bs\\) will, under any rule of evolution, drive to\nextinction any sufficiently small group of invaders all of which play\nthe same strategy. An evolutionary game has usn-stability just in case\nit meets a simple condition on payoffs identified by Maynard\nSmith:\n\n(MS) For all strategies\n\\(\\bj\\), \\(V(\\bi,\\bi) \\gt V(\\bj,\\bi)\\) or both \\(V(\\bi,\\bi) =\nV(\\bj,\\bi)\\) and \\(V(\\bi,\\bj) \\gt V(\\bj,\\bj)\\). \n\n\n(Here, and in what follows, the notation \\(V(\\bi,\\bj)\\) indicates the\npayoff to strategy \\(\\bi\\) when \\(\\bi\\) plays \\(\\bj\\).) MS says that\nany invaders do strictly worse against the natives than the natives\nthemselves do against the natives or else they get exactly the same\npayoff against the natives as the natives themselves do, but the\nnative does better against the invader than the invader himself\ndoes.\n\nFor any strategy \\(\\bi\\) in the IPD (or indeed in any iterated finite\ngame), however, there are strategies \\(\\bj\\) different from \\(\\bi\\)\nsuch that \\(\\bj\\) mimics the way \\(\\bi\\) plays when it plays against\n\\(\\bi\\) or \\(\\bj\\). The existence of these \u201cneutral\nmutants\u201d implies that MS cannot be satisfied and so no EPD has\nusn-stability. This argument, of course, uses the assumption that any\nstrategy in the iterated game is a possible invader. There may be good\nreason to restrict the available strategies. For example, if the\nplayers are assumed to have no knowledge of previous interactions,\nthen it may be appropriate to restrict available strategies to the\nunconditional ones. Since a pair of players then get the same payoffs\nin every round of an iterated game, we may as well take each round of\nthe evolutionary game to be one-shot games between every pair of\nplayers rather than iterated games. Indeed, this is the kind of\nevolutionary game that Maynard Smith himself considered. In this\nframework, any strategy \\(\\bS\\) such that \\((\\bS,\\bS)\\) is a strict\nnash equilibrium in the underlying one-shot game (including\nunconditional defection in the PD) meets the MS condition. Thus MS and\nusn-stability are non-trivial conditions in some contexts.\n\nA strategy \\(\\bs\\) has restricted weak broad stability)\n(rwb-stability) if, when evolution proceeds according to the\nproportional fitness rule and the native population is playing\n\\(\\bs\\), any (possibly heterogeneous) group of invaders of\nsufficiently small size will fail to drive the natives to extinction.\nThis condition turns out to be equivalent to a weakened version of MS\nidentified by Bendor and Swistak.\n\n(BS) For all strategies\n\\(\\bj\\), \\(V(\\bi,\\bi) \\gt V(\\bj,\\bi)\\) or both \\(V(\\bi,\\bi) =\nV(\\bj,\\bi)\\) and \\(V(\\bi,\\bj) \\ge V(\\bj,\\bj)\\). \n\n\nBS and rwb-stability are non-trivial conditions in the more general\nevolutionary framework: strategies for the EPD that satisfy\nrwb-stability do exist. This does not particularly vindicate any of\nthe strategies discussed above, however. Bendor and Swistak prove a\nresult analogous to the folk theorem mentioned previously: If the\nshadow of the future is sufficiently large, there are rwb-stable\nstrategies supporting any degree of cooperation from zero to one. One\nway to distinguish among the strategies that meet BS is by the size of\nthe invasion required to overturn the natives, or, equivalently, by\nthe proportion of natives required to maintain stability. Bendor and\nSwistak show that this number, the minimal stabilizing\nfrequency, never exceeds 1/2: no population can resist every\ninvading group as large as itself. They maintain that this result does\nallow them to begin to provide a theoretical justification for\nAxelrod's claims. They are able to show that, as the shadow of the\nfuture approaches one, any strategy that is nice (meaning that it is\nnever first to defect) and retaliatory (meaning that it always defects\nimmediately after it has been defected against) has a minimal\nstabilizing frequency approaching one half. TFT has\nboth these properties and, in fact, they are the first two of the four\nproperties Axelrod cited as instrumental to TFT's\nsuccess. There are, of course, many other nice and retaliatory\nstrategies, and there are strategies (like \\(\\bP_1\\)) that are not\nretaliatory but still satisfy rwb-stability. But Bendor and Swistak\nare at least able to show that any \u201cmaximally robust\u201d\nstrategy, i.e., any strategy whose minimum stabilizing frequency\napproaches one half, chooses cooperation on all but a finite number of\nmoves in an infinitely repeated PD.\n\nBendor and Swistak's results must be interpreted with some care.\nFirst, one should keep in mind that no probabilistic or\nnoise-sensitive strategies can fit the definitions of either\n\u201cnice\u201d or \u201cretaliatory\u201d strategies.\nFurthermore, imperfect versions of TFT do not satisfy\nrwb-stability. They can be overthrown by arbitrarily small invasions\nof deterministic TFT or, indeed, by arbitrary small\ninvasions of any less imperfect TFT. Second, one must\nremember that the results about minimal stabilizing frequencies only\nconcern weak stability. If the number of generations is large compared\nwith the original population (as it often is in biological\napplications), a population that is initially composed entirely of\nplayers employing the same maximally robust strategy, could well admit\na sequence of small invading groups that eventually reduces the\noriginal strategy to less than half of the population. At that point\nthe original strategy could be overthrown.\n\nIt is likely that both of these caveats play some role in explaining\nan apparent discrepancy between the Bendor/Swistak results and the\nNowak/Sigmund simulations. One would expect Bendor/Swistak's minimal\nstabilizing frequency to provide some indication of the length of time\nthat a population plays a particular strategy. A strategy requiring a\nlarge invasion to overturn is likely to prevail longer than a strategy\nrequiring only a small invasion. A straightforward calculation reveals\nthat \\(\\bP_1\\) has a relatively low minimum stabilizing frequency. It\nis overturned by invasions of unconditional defectors exceeding\n\\(10\\%\\) of the population. Yet in the Nowak/Sigmund simulations,\n\\(\\bP_1\\)-like strategies predominate over TFT-like\nstrategies. Since the simulations required imperfection and since they\ngenerated a sequence of mutants vastly larger than the original\npopulation, there is no real contradiction here. Nevertheless the\ndiscrepancy suggests that we do not yet have a theoretical\nunderstanding of EPDs sufficient to predict the strategies that will\nemerge under various plausible conditions.\n\nLike usn-stability, the concept of rwb-stability can be more\ndiscriminating if it is relativized to a particular set of strategies.\nMolander's 1992 investigation of Schelling's many-person version of\nthe PD, for example, restricts attention to the family\n\\(\\{\\bS_1,\\ldots,\\bS_n\\}\\) of TFT-like stratgies. A\nplayer adopting \\(\\bS_i\\) cooperates on the first round and on every\nsubsequent round after at least \\(i\\) others cooperate. By construing\nstability as resistance to invasions by other family members, Molander\nis able to show that there are conditions under which a particular mix\nof two of the \\(\\bS_i\\)'s (one equivalent to \\(\\bDu\\)) is uniquely\nstable. The significance of results like these, however, depends on\nthe plausibility of such limitations on the set of permissible\nstrategies.\nEvolution and the Optional PD\n\nIn iterated and evolutionary versions of the optional PD, we imagine\nthat players from some population are repeatedly paired off and given\nthe opportunity to play the PD (choosing either \\(\\bC\\) or \\(\\bD\\)) or\nto opt out (choosing \\(\\bN\\)). In choosing \\(\\bN\\), a player forgoes\nthe opportunity of receiving the reward or temptation payoffs until\nthe next pairing. In most human interactions that come to mind, a\nrefusal to engage with a particular partner does not represent quite\nthe same loss of opportunity to engage with another as a choice to\nengage does. If I buy a car from an unscrupulous dealer, I'll have to\nwait a long time before my next car purchase to do better; but if I\nrefuse to engage with her I can immediately begin negotiating with a\nneighboring dealer. Nevertheless, there may be situations among people\n(and more likely among non-human animals or among nations or\ncorporations) that are appropriately modeled by evolutionary versions\nof the optional PD.\n\nWe can represent the strategies for the evolutionary optional PD that\ndo not require memory of previous interaction as triples \\(\\langle\np,q,r \\rangle\\), where \\(p\\), \\(q\\) and \\(r\\) are real numbers adding\nto one, representing the probability of playing \\(\\bC\\), \\(\\bD\\) and\n\\(\\bN\\). None of these strategies meets the BS condition, and so no\nstrategy is rwb-stable within this family. If all the members of a\ngroup unconditionally refuse to engage (adopting \\(\\langle 0,0,1\n\\rangle\\)), then they can be infiltrated and eventually replaced by\nsmall invasions of more cooperative strategies. The cooperative\nstrategies, in turn, will be overthrown by defecting strategies, and,\nwhen the concentration of defectors is sufficiently great, the\n\u201cloners\u201d who refuse to engage can again take over. Adding\nthe option of not-playing to the evolutionary PD does permit escape\nfrom from the unhappy state of universal defection, but leads to an\nonly slightly less undesirable outcome in which a population cycles\nrepeatedly through states of universal non-engagement. (Szab\u00f3\nand Hauert contains a nice picture of the phenomenon.)\n\nAmong strategies that do allow dependence on previous interaction,\nBatali and Kitcher like an analog of GRIM that they\ncall Discriminating Altruist (henceforth\nDA). DA cooperates with any player\nthat has never defected against it, and otherwise refuses to engage.\nThey show that, among a group of five simple strategies, there will be\na cyclic pattern like that described above in which\n\u201canti-social\u201d (defecting) strategies are replaced by\n\u201casocial\u201d (non-engaging) strategies, which are replaced in\nturn by \u201csocial\u201d (DA) strategies, which are replaced again\nby \u201canti-social\u201d strategies. Their analysis, however,\nleads them to conclude that if members of a population are restricted\nto these five strategies, evolution will lead them to spend\n\u201cmost of their time in states of high cooperation,\u201d\n(though not as much as would be the case in a \u201cfully\noptional\u201d game where, in each round, only those who accurately\nsignal a willingness to engage are paired). Simulations among agents\nwho are permitted any strategies where a move depend on the two\nprevious moves of its opponent are said to provide rough\ncorroboration. Some caution is in order here. There is little analysis\nof which strategies underlie the cooperating populations in the\nsimulations and, indeed, DA is not an option for an\nagent whose memory goes back only two games. Oddly, slightly\nless cooperativity is reported for the fully optional version\nof the game than for the semi-optional (though in each case, as would\nbe expected, cooperativity is significantly greater tha n for the\nordinary PD). The evolutionary dynamics employed and the measures of\ncooperativity employed are sufficiently idiosyncratic to make\ncomparisons with other work difficult. Despite all these caveats, it\nseems safe to conclude that taking engagement to be optional can\nprovide another explanation for the fact that universal, unrelenting\ndefection is rarely seen in patterns of interaction sometimes modeled\nas evolutionary PDs.\n",
