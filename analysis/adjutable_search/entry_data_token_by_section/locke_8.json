    "main_text": "The Limits of Human Understanding || Book IV\n2.4 Book IV\n\nIn the fourth book of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\nLocke tells us what knowledge is and what humans can know and what\nthey cannot (not simply what they do and do not happen to know). Locke\ndefines knowledge as \u201cthe perception of the connexion and\nagreement or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our Ideas\u201d\n(IV.1.1, N: 525). This definition of knowledge contrasts with the\nCartesian definition of knowledge as any ideas that are clear and\ndistinct. Locke\u2019s account of knowledge allows him to say that we\ncan know substances in spite of the fact that our ideas of them always\ninclude the obscure and relative idea of substance in general. Still,\nLocke\u2019s definition of knowledge raises in this domain a problem\nanalogous to those we have seen with perception and language. If\nknowledge is the \u201cperception of \u2026 the agreement or\ndisagreement \u2026 of any of our Ideas\u201d\u2014are we not\ntrapped in the circle of our own ideas? What about knowing the real\nexistence of things? Locke is plainly aware of this problem, and very\nlikely holds that the implausibility of skeptical hypotheses, such as\nDescartes\u2019 Dream hypothesis (he doesn\u2019t even bother to\nmention Descartes\u2019 malin genie or Evil Demon\nhypothesis), along with the causal connections between qualities and\nideas in his own system is enough to solve the problem. It is also\nworth noting that there are significant differences between\nLocke\u2019s brand of empiricism and that of Berkeley that would make\nit easier for Locke to solve the veil of perception problem than\nBerkeley. Locke, for example, makes transdictive inferences about\natoms where Berkeley is unwilling to allow that such inferences are\nlegitimate. This implies that Locke has a semantics that allows him to\ntalk about the unexperienced causes of experience (such as atoms)\nwhere Berkeley cannot. (See Mackie\u2019s perceptive discussion of\nthe veil of perception problem, in Problems from Locke, 1976:\n51 through 67.)\n\nWhat then can we know and with what degree of certainty? We can know\nthat God exists with the second highest degree of assurance, that of\ndemonstration. We also know that we exist with the highest degree of\ncertainty. The truths of morality and mathematics we can know with\ncertainty as well, because these are modal ideas whose adequacy is\nguaranteed by the fact that we make such ideas as ideal models which\nother things must fit, rather than trying to copy some external\narchetype which we can only grasp inadequately. On the other hand, our\nefforts to grasp the nature of external objects are limited largely to\nthe connection between their apparent qualities. The real essence of\nelephants and gold is hidden from us: though in general we suppose\nthem to be some distinct combination of atoms which cause the grouping\nof apparent qualities which leads us to see elephants and violets,\ngold and lead as distinct kinds. Our knowledge of material things is\nprobabilistic and thus opinion rather than knowledge. Thus our\n\u201cknowledge\u201d of external objects is inferior to our\nknowledge of mathematics and morality, of ourselves, and of God. We do\nhave sensitive knowledge of external objects, which is limited to\nthings we are presently experiencing. While Locke holds that we only\nhave knowledge of a limited number of things, he thinks we can judge\nthe truth or falsity of many propositions in addition to those we can\nlegitimately claim to know. This brings us to a discussion of\nprobability.\n",
