    "main_text": "Faith as an act of trust\n6. Faith as an act of trust\n\nNot all models of faith, however, identify it as primarily a matter of\nknowing or believing a proposition or a set of them, even with the\naddition of some affective or evaluative component. What is most\ncentral to theistic faith may seem better expressed as believing\nin God, rather than as believing that God exists.\nThe Christian Nicene creed begins \u2018Credo in unum Deum\n\u2026\u2019 and it is arguable that in this context \u2018belief\nin\u2019 is neither merely an idiomatic variant on, nor reducible to,\n\u2018belief that\u2019 (Price 1965). It may thus be held that\ntheists\u2019 acceptance of propositional truths as divinely revealed\nrests on believing in God\u2014and it is this\n\u2018believing in\u2019, or \u2018having faith in\u2019, which\nis, fundamentally, the nature of faith. Noting that, while faith is\nheld to be a virtue, believing as such is not, Wilfred Cantwell Smith\nargues that \u2018faith is not belief\u2019, \u2018but something of\na quite different order\u2019 (Smith 1979, 128), requiring\n\u2018assent\u2019 \u2018in the dynamic and personal sense of\nrallying to [what one takes to be the truth] with delight and\nengagement\u2019 (142). Arguably, to put or to maintain faith\nin God involves a readiness to act, perhaps by relying on God\nin relevant ways and/or grounded in a practical commitment. Our\nconsiderations now shift, then, from propositional-attitude-focussed\nmodels of faith to those focussed on action, or what J. L.\nSchellenberg calls \u2018operational\u2019 models (2005, 126).\n\nJudeo-Christian scripture envisions humans as actively engaged in a\ncovenantal relationship with God. Their ongoing participation in, and\ncommitment to, such a relationship paradigmatically involves both\nfaith in God and faithfulness to God (McKaughan and Howard-Snyder\n2022a and 2023a; Pace and McKaughan 2020). The kind of faith of which\nChristian faith is a paradigm case, then, may be understood as\n\u2018action-centred commitment\u2019 (McKaughan 2016, 78), e.g., to\nthe Christian \u2018way\u2019. Arguably, faith understood as a\ncombination of affective and cognitive elements would miss its\nessential active component. We now turn, then, to consider a\nfiducial model\u2014a model of faith as trust, understood\nnot simply as an affective state but as an action.\n\nOn a fiducial model, having faith in God is making a practical\ncommitment\u2014the kind involved in trusting God, or,\ntrusting in God. (The root meaning of the Greek\npistis, \u2018faith\u2019, is \u2018trust\u2019 (see\nMorgan 2015).) On such a model, faith\u2019s active, practical\ncomponent takes central place, though a cognitive component may be\npresupposed by it. Swinburne calls it the \u2018Lutheran\u2019\nmodel, and defines it thus: \u2018the person of faith does not merely\nbelieve that there is a God (and believe certain propositions about\nhim)\u2014he trusts Him and commits himself to Him\u2019 (2005,\n142). Yet, as noted earlier, Aquinas too takes the ultimate object of\nfaith to be God, \u2018the first reality\u2019, and, furthermore,\nunderstands \u2018formed\u2019 faith as trusting commitment to God,\nmotivated by, and directed towards, love of God as one\u2019s true\nend (see Summa Theologiae 2a2ae, 4, 3; Aquinas [2006],\n123\u20137). It is true that Aquinas allows that the devils have\nfaith in a certain sense, but this \u2018faith\u2019 amounts only to\ntheir belief that what the Church teaches is the truth, arrived at not\nby grace but \u2018forced from them\u2019 reluctantly by \u2018the\nacumen of their natural intelligence\u2019 (Summa Theologiae\n2a2ae, 5, 2; Aquinas [2006], 155 & 157). Aquinas\u2019s account\nof \u2018saving\u2019 faith is thus also a fiducial model.\n\nThe venture of trust\n\nAs noted at the outset, there is a usage of \u2018faith\u2019 for\nwhich \u2018having/placing faith in\u2019 is (near enough)\nsynonymous with \u2018trusting\u2019 or \u2018trusting in\u2019.\n(For discussion of how faith relates to a range of contemporary\ntheories of trust, see McKaughan and Howard-Snyder 2022b.) If,\nmoreover, faith of the religious kind is itself a type of trust, then\nwe may expect our understanding of religious faith to profit from an\nanalysis of trust in general. It is therefore worth considering what\nfollows about the nature of faith of the sort exemplified in theistic\nfaith from holding it to be a kind of active trust.\n\nConceptually fundamental to trust is the notion of a person (or\npersons)\u2014the truster\u2014trusting in some agent or\nagency\u2014the trustee\u2014for some (assumedly)\nfavourable outcome (though what the trustee is trusted for is often\nonly implicit in the context). Trust involves a venture; so\ntoo\u2014it is widely agreed\u2014does faith. So, if faith is trust,\nthe venture of faith might be presumed to be the type of venture\nimplicated in trust. A venture is an action that places the agent and\noutcomes of concern to the agent significantly beyond the\nagent\u2019s own control. Trust implies venture. When we trust we\ncommit ourselves to another\u2019s control, accepting\u2014and, when\nnecessary, co-operating as \u2018patient\u2019\u2014with the\ndecisions of the trustee. Venturing in trust is usually assumed to be\nessentially risky, making oneself vulnerable to adverse\noutcomes or betrayal. Swinburne makes the point this way: \u2018To\ntrust someone is to act on the assumption that she will do for you\nwhat she knows that you want or need, when the evidence gives some\nreason for supposing that she may not and where there will be bad\nconsequences if the assumption is false\u2019 (2005, 143). Annette\nBaier makes no requirement for evidence that the trustee may prove\nuntrustworthy, but nevertheless takes trust to involve \u2018accepted\nvulnerability to another\u2019s possible but not expected\nill will (or lack of good will) toward one\u2019 (Baier 1986, 235,\nour emphasis). Accordingly, it seems sensible to hold that one should\ntrust only with good reason. But if, as is plausible, good reason to\ntrust requires sufficient evidence of the trustee\u2019s\ntrustworthiness, reasonable trust appears both to have its\nventuresomeness diminished and, at the same time, to become more\ndifficult to achieve than we normally suppose. For we often lack\nadequate\u2014or even, any\u2014evidence of a trustee\u2019s\ntrustworthiness in advance of our venture, yet in many such cases we\nsuppose that our trust is reasonable (see, for example, Adams 1987).\nBut, if adequate evidence of trustworthiness is not required\nfor reasonable trust, how is reasonable trust different from\n\u2018blind\u2019 trust?\n\nThe answer seems clear: reasonable trust is practically\nrational trust. The question of when one may rationally trust\nanother may thus be resolved by a decision-theoretic calculation,\nfactoring in the extent to which one\u2019s evidence supports the\npotential trustee\u2019s trustworthiness and the utilities of the\npossible outcomes, given one\u2019s intended aims. The exercise of\npractical reasoning does include mental acts which are epistemically\nevaluable, however. When one takes it to be true in practical\nreasoning that someone will prove trustworthy, that mental act may be\nmore or less epistemically rational: it would break the evidentialist\nnorm to employ in a decision-theoretic calculation a credence that\ndoes not match one\u2019s available evidence. In many situations, it\nwill be practically rational, given one\u2019s intentions, to trust\nanother person only if one believes, or, at least, believes with high\nprobability, that the person will prove trustworthy. In such\nsituations it is also often the case, as already noted, that we\ndon\u2019t have adequate evidence in advance that this\nperson will be trustworthy in this particular respect. Yet,\naffording high credence to a person\u2019s trustworthiness may still\nbe epistemically rational given wider available evidence of, for\nexample, the person\u2019s past friendliness and trustworthiness in\nother matters, or, if the person is a stranger, of our shared social\nexperience that trusting others generally elicits a trustworthy\nresponse. Nevertheless, it can still be\nrational\u2014practically rational, that is\u2014to trust\nanother when we don\u2019t have adequate evidence that they\nwill prove trustworthy. In a life-threatening situation, for example,\nit may be rational to trust unlikely rescuers if they are the only\nones available. Or, when we have wider aims, it may be practically\nrational to trust those without a record of trustworthiness, as with\n\u2018educative\u2019 and \u2018therapeutic\u2019 trust where\npeople are trusted for the sake of their development or rehabilitation\nas trustworthy persons. Being in established relationships of\nfriendship with others, too, can also require commitment to continue\nto trust them even in the face of evidence that, otherwise, would make\nit reasonable to believe them unworthy of trust.\n\nOn models that take faith of the theist kind to consist fundamentally\nin an act of trust, the analogy with interpersonal trust is\nsuggestive. When one person trusts another there seems typically\n(though not uniformly) to be a doxastic aspect (the truster\u2019s\nbelief that the trustee is trustworthy). But what\u2019s essential is\nthe fiducial aspect, which consists in an active commitment or\n\u2018entrusting\u2019 to the other. Paul Helm proposes that theist\nfaith similarly has importantly distinct doxastic and fiducial\naspects: in addition to belief about God\u2019s existence and\ntrustworthiness for salvation held with a degree of strength\nproportional to the believer\u2019s evidence, persons of faith must\nalso entrust themselves to the one on whom they rely (Helm 2000).\nWhile it is widely agreed that theist faith must have a cognitive\naspect, some philosophers hold that this need not be doxastic (as we\nshall see in Section 8).\n",
