    "main_text": "Personal Relations, Family, and Disability || The Nature of Personal Relationships\n3.1 The Nature of Personal Relationships\n\nThe term \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d encompasses relationships\nof widely varying sorts. We will focus on relationships typically\nunderstood as enduring and in some way intimate: between parents and\nchildren, siblings, friends, and committed partners. In that respect,\nour conception of personal relationships is narrower than the broad\nconception of a relationship that figures in some of the literature on\nrelational egalitarian theories of justice (see, for example, Anderson\n2010; though for a principle of relational egalitarianism that is\nderived from consideration of what spouses owe one another, see\nScheffler 2014). The close relationships we have in mind\u2014whether\nof friendship, partnership, or family\u2014involve some degree of\nmutual regard, personal disclosure, and particularized knowledge. They\nalso involve material and emotional mutuality, but need not involve\nequal exchanges between the parties. \n\nPhilosophers have often treated equality of some kind as a\nprerequisite of friendship (see\n SEP entry on friendship).\n In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle distinguished among\nthree kinds of friendship: friendships of pleasure, of utility, and of\nvirtue. The last, the highest or truest form, required similarity of\ncharacter. Philosophers since Aristotle have rejected some of his\nprerequisites for friendship, such as equality of social or economic\nstatus, but they have shared his view that friendship must be a\nrelationship among equals. The debate has largely focused on the kind\nof equality that is required. Thus, Aristotle denied that parents and\ntheir children could ever be true friends, since the inequality\nbetween them could never be overcome no matter how much the child does\nfor his parents. This position is rejected by English (1979) and\nKristjansson (2006). Generally, contemporary accounts of friendship\nplace less emphasis on equality or similarity of specific traits and\nmore on equality of respect, investment, and commitment. Given the\nvast range of differences among close friends in talents, interests,\nand tangible contributions, it would not seem that disabilities pose\nany general barrier to intimacy. \n\nNevertheless, philosophers and bioethicists have tended to look\nskeptically on the possibility that a person with a disability could\noffer the mutuality and equality required for a satisfying\nrelationship with a nondisabled friend, romantic partner, or family\nmember. Even in those relationships where unequal contributions and\nasymmetric dependence are the norm, as with parents and their\nchildren, a child\u2019s disability has been seen as an obstacle to a\ndesirable and rewarding relationship. The disability is perceived as\ncreating an uncomfortable degree of inequality and dissimilarity;\nparents have difficulty picturing the child growing into a productive\nadult and parent, fulfilling some of the goals people have for\nundertaking childrearing (Ruddick 1998). Additionally, the\nchild\u2019s disability has been viewed as imposing burdens on\nparents that differ from and greatly exceed those posed by raising\nchildren who do not have disabilities (Botkin 1995). Moreover, the\nchild\u2019s disability is presumed to extend the duration of\nparental care (Botkin 1995; Kittay 1999; Lindemann and Nelson 2008).\nSimilarly, when the bioethics literature considers people with\ndisabilities as parents, it is largely to assess whether it will be\nharmful for children to be raised by disabled parents (Coleman 2002;\nRobertson 2004); or whether adult children will have to give up their\nother life projects to care for their newly-disabled parents (Callahan\n1988). \n\nIn this literature, relationships involving disabled people are\nchiefly viewed from the perspective of those without disabilities.\nWhether the topic is end-of-life decision making (Hardwig 2000),\ntreatment decisions for low birth weight, premature or otherwise\ndisabled newborns (Stack 1987), the rehabilitation of persons after\ntraumatic brain injury (Nelson and Frader 2004), or selection for or\nagainst disabling traits in embryos or fetuses (Botkin 1995; Ruddick\n2000; Green 2008), the focus is on how nondisabled people are affected\nby a (potential) relationship with someone who has a disability. What\nis largely missing from these accounts is serious consideration of the\nperspective of the person with a disability; of how her life will be\naffected, for good or ill, by the family or friendship relationships\nin which she is embedded. In addition, little attention is paid to\nrelationships in which all involved parties have disabilities. As\nChappell (1994) has noted, writers assume that it is in the interest\nof people with disabilities to aspire to relationships with\nnondisabled people, even if it is not is the interest of the latter.\nIt seems clear that if the consequences of personal relationships for\nthe flourishing of persons with disabilities were given the same\nweight as the consequences for nondisabled persons, it would encourage\na deeper and fuller appreciation of the goods of personal\nrelationships. \n",
