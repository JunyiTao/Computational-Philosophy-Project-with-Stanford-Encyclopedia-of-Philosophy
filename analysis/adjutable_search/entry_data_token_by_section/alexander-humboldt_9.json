    "main_text": "The Philosophy of Nature || The Physiognomy of Plants and the Physiognomy of Nature\n4.2 The Physiognomy of Plants and the Physiognomy of Nature\n\nHumboldt first introduced the notion of a physiognomy of nature in a\nlecture delivered at the Prussian Academy of the Sciences in Berlin in\nJanuary 1805. Titled \u201cIdeen zu einer Physiognomik der\nGew\u00e4chse [Ideas for a Physiognomy of Plants]\u201d, the\nlecture was later published in the first edition of Ansichten der\nNatur. Its aim is to introduce Humboldt\u2019s audience to a new\nway of looking at the natural world: physiognomy. \n\nHumboldt is clear that the work of the physiognomist of nature\ncontrasts with that of the botanist, who generally focuses on small,\nalmost hidden parts of the plant\u2014the sexual organs or, at times,\nthe fruit. This goes hand in hand with the fact that the physiognomist\naims to discern the \u201cfundamental forms\u201d of plants. These\nforms do not align with taxonomic categories.\n\nThough Humboldt offers different fundamental forms in his writings (at\ntimes adding, at times subtracting a form), he is clear that his list\nis incomplete, given that it is based on his knowledge and research,\nand that new plants will be discovered and perhaps also new forms.\nWhen he distinguishes a form, Humboldt describes both its individual\ncharacteristics\u2014detailing, for instance, the shape of its\nleaves, its usual size (height and width), its overall\ngesture\u2014and its growth patterns\u2014where and when it grows,\nunder which conditions, next to which other plants, and so on.\n\nBy focusing on forms, Humboldt recognizes that certain plant\nforms\u2014whether tall grasses, or conifers, myrtles, or\nmosses\u2014reappear across the earth. This leads him to conclude\nthat there are fundamental forms which are \u201crepeated\u201d or\n\u201creplaced\u201d, even though they are \u201cseparated by\noceans or broad expanses of land\u201d (DA 5: 266; VN: 219).\nHumboldt\u2019s insight paved the way for Carl Troll\u2019s later\nresearch on \u201cconvergent evolution\u201d (Beck 1989:\n266\u20137; Troll 1959). It also allowed Humboldt to discern a deep\nconnection between plants and their contexts: certain forms only\nappear next to certain neighbors, while others only appear at certain\naltitudes, and so on. Humboldt was not, however, an environmental\ndeterminist. For, he emphasized, plant forms persist across\nthe earth, and although they are sensitive to their contexts, they are\nnot entirely determined by them. The form of the willow, for instance,\npersists despite the fact that a willow growing on a windy and cold\nmountainside will never achieve the shape and size of a willow growing\nnear a river (DA 5: 287; VN: 234). \n",
