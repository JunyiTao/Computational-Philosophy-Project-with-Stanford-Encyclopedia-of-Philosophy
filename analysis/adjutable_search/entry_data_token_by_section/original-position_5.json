    "main_text": "Other Conditions on Choice in the Original Position || The Circumstances of Justice (TJ \u00a722)\n5.1 The Circumstances of Justice (TJ \u00a722)\n\nAmong the general facts the parties know are \u201cthe circumstances\nof justice.\u201d Rawls says these are \u201cconditions under which\nhuman cooperation is both possible and necessary\u201d (TJ 126/109\nrev.). Following Hume, Rawls distinguishes two general kinds: the\nobjective and subjective circumstances of justice. The former include\nphysical facts about human beings, such as their rough similarity in\nmental and physical faculties, and vulnerability to the united force\nof others. Objective circumstances also include conditions of moderate\nscarcity of resources: there are not enough resources to satisfy\neveryone\u2019s desires, but there are enough to provide all with\nadequate satisfaction of their basic needs; unlike conditions of\nextreme scarcity (e.g. famine), cooperation then seems productive and\nworthwhile for people.\n\nAmong the subjective circumstances of justice are the parties\u2019\nmutual disinterestedness, which reflects the \u201climited\naltruism\u201d (TJ 146/127) of persons in society.. Free and equal\npersons have their own plans of life and special commitments to\nothers, as well as different philosophical and religious beliefs and\nmoral doctrines (TJ 127/110). Hume says that if humans were\nimpartially benevolent, equally concerned with everyone\u2019s\nwelfare, then justice would be unnecessary. People then would\nwillingly sacrifice their interests for the greater advantage of\nother. They would not be concerned about their personal rights or\npossessions, and property would be unnecessary (Hume 1777 [1970,\n185\u2013186]). But we are more concerned with our own aims and\ninterests\u2014which include our interests in the interests of those\nnearer and dearer to us\u2014than we are with the interests of\nstrangers with whom we have few if any interactions. This implies a\npotential conflict of human interests. Rawls adds that concern for our\ninterests and plans of life does not mean we are selfish or have\ninterests only in ourselves\u2014again, interests of a self\nshould not be confused with interests in oneself; we have\ninterests in others and in all kinds of causes, ends, and commitments\nto other persons (TJ 127/110). But, as history shows, our benevolent\ninterests in others and in religious and philosophical doctrines are\nat least as often the cause of social and international conflict as is\nself-interest.\n\nThe subjective circumstances of justice also include limitations on\nhuman knowledge, thought, and judgment, as well as emotional\ninfluences and great diversity of experiences. These lead to biases\nand inevitable disagreements in factual and other judgments, as well\nas to differences in religious, philosophical, and moral convictions.\nIn Political Liberalism, Rawls highlights these subjective\ncircumstances, calling them \u201cthe burdens of judgment\u201d (PL\n54\u201358). They imply, significantly, that regardless how impartial\nand altruistic people are, they still will disagree in their factual\njudgments and in religious, philosophical and moral doctrines.\nDisagreements in these matters are inevitable even among fully\nrational and reasonable people. This is \u201cthe fact of reasonable\npluralism\u201d (PL 36), which is another general fact known to the\nparties in the original position. Reasonable pluralism of doctrines\nlends significant support to Rawls\u2019s arguments for the first\nprinciple of justice, especially to equal basic liberties of\nconscience, expression, and association.\n",
