    "main_text": "Astronomical Ideas and Writings || On the Revolutions\n2.3 On the Revolutions\n\nThe Commentariolus was only intended as an introduction to\nCopernicus\u2019s ideas, and he wrote \u201cthe mathematical\ndemonstrations intended for my larger work should be omitted for\nbrevity\u2019s sake\u2026\u201d (MW 82). In a sense it\nwas an announcement of the greater work that Copernicus had begun. The\nCommentariolus was never published during Copernicus\u2019s\nlifetime, but he sent manuscript copies to various astronomers and\nphilosophers. He received some discouragement because the heliocentric\nsystem seemed to disagree with the Bible, but mostly he was\nencouraged. Although Copernicus\u2019s involvement with official\nattempts to reform the calendar was limited to a no longer extant\nletter, that endeavor made a new, serious astronomical theory welcome.\nFear of the reaction of ecclesiastical authorities was probably the\nleast of the reasons why he delayed publishing his\n book.[7]\n The most important reasons for the delay was that the larger work\nrequired both astronomical observations and intricate mathematical\nproofs. His administrative duties certainly interfered with both the\nresearch and the writing. He was unable to make the regular\nobservations that he needed and Frombork, which was often fogged in,\nwas not a good place for those observations. Moreover, as Gingerich\n(1993, 37) pointed out,\n\n[Copernicus] was far from the major international centers of printing\nthat could profitably handle a book as large and technical as De\nrevolutionibus. On the other [hand], his manuscript was still\nfull of numerical inconsistencies, and he knew very well that he had\nnot taken complete advantage of the opportunities that the\nheliocentric viewpoint offered\u2026Furthermore, Copernicus was far\nfrom academic centers, thereby lacking the stimulation of technically\ntrained colleagues with whom he could discuss his work.\n\n\nThe manuscript of On the Revolutions was basically complete\nwhen Rheticus came to visit him in 1539. The work comprised six books.\nThe first book, the best known, discussed what came to be known as the\nCopernican theory and what is Copernicus\u2019s most important\ncontribution to astronomy, the heliocentric universe (although in\nCopernicus\u2019s model, the sun is not truly in the center). Book 1\nset out the order of the heavenly bodies about the sun: \u201c[The\nsphere of the fixed stars] is followed by the first of the planets,\nSaturn, which completes its circuit in 30 years. After Saturn, Jupiter\naccomplishes its revolution in 12 years. The Mars revolves in 2 years.\nThe annual revolution takes the series\u2019 fourth place, which\ncontains the earth\u2026together with the lunar sphere as an\nepicycle. In the fifth place Venus returns in 9 months. Lastly, the\nsixth place is held by Mercury, which revolves in a period of 80\ndays\u201d (Revolutions, 21\u201322). This established a\nrelationship between the order of the planets and their periods, and\nit made a unified system. This may be the most important argument in\nfavor of the heliocentric model as Copernicus described\n it.[8]\n It was far superior to Ptolemy\u2019s model, which had the planets\nrevolving around the earth so that the sun, Mercury, and Venus all had\nthe same annual revolution. In book 1 Copernicus also insisted that\nthe movements of all bodies must be circular and uniform, and noted\nthat the reason they may appear nonuniform to us is \u201ceither that\ntheir circles have poles different [from the earth\u2019s] or that\nthe earth is not at the center of the circles on which they\nrevolve\u201d (Revolutions, 11). Particularly notable for\nCopernicus was that in Ptolemy\u2019s model the sun, the moon, and\nthe five planets seemed ironically to have different motions from the\nother heavenly bodies and it made more sense for the small earth to\nmove than the immense heavens. But the fact that Copernicus turned the\nearth into a planet did not cause him to reject Aristotelian physics,\nfor he maintained that \u201cland and water together press upon a\nsingle center of gravity; that the earth has no other center of\nmagnitude; that, since earth is heavier, its gaps are filled with\nwater\u2026\u201d (Revolutions, 10). As Aristotle had\nasserted, the earth was the center toward which the physical elements\ngravitate. This was a problem for Copernicus\u2019s model, because if\nthe earth was no longer the center, why should elements gravitate\ntoward it?\n\nThe second book of On the Revolutions elaborated the concepts\nin the first book; book 3 dealt with the precession of the equinoxes\nand solar theory; book 4 dealt with the moon\u2019s motions; book 5\ndealt with the planetary longitude and book 6 with\n latitude.[9]\n Copernicus depended very much on Ptolemy\u2019s observations, and\nthere was little new in his mathematics. He was most successful in his\nwork on planetary longitude, which, as Swerdlow and Neugebauer (77)\ncommented, was \u201cCopernicus\u2019s most admirable, and most\ndemanding, accomplishment\u2026It was above all the decision to\nderive new elements for the planets that delayed for nearly half a\nlifetime Copernicus\u2019s continuation of his work \u2013 nearly\ntwenty years devoted to observation and then several more to the most\ntedious kind of computation \u2013 and the result was recognized by\nhis contemporaries as the equal of Ptolemy\u2019s accomplishment,\nwhich was surely the highest praise for an astronomer.\u201d\nSurprisingly, given that the elimination of the equant was so\nimportant in the Commentariolus, Copernicus did not mention\nit in book 1, but he sought to replace it with an epicyclet throughout\nOn the Revolutions. Nevertheless, he did write in book 5 when\ndescribing the motion of Mercury:\n\n\u2026the ancients allowed the epicycle to move uniformly only\naround the equant\u2019s center. This procedure was in gross conflict\nwith the true center [of the epicycle\u2019s motion], its relative\n[distances], and the prior centers of both [other\ncircles]\u2026However, in order that this last planet too may be\nrescued from the affronts and pretenses of its detractors, and that\nits uniform motion, no less than that of the other aforementioned\nplanets, may be revealed in relation to the earth\u2019s motion, I\nshall attribute to it too, [as the circle mounted] on its eccentric,\nan eccentric instead of the epicycle accepted in antiquity\n(Revolutions, 278\u201379).\n\n",
