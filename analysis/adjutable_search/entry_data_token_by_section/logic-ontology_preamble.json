Both logic and ontology are diverse fields\nwithin philosophy and, partly because of this, there is not one single\nphilosophical problem about the relation between them. In this survey\narticle we will first discuss what different philosophical projects\nare carried out under the headings of \u201clogic\u201d and\n\u201contology\u201d and then we will look at several areas where\nlogic and ontology overlap.\n",
