Cognitivist sentimentalists\nthink they are descriptive beliefs about sentiments or the\ndisposition to cause sentiments. (I\u2019ll explore further varieties\nbelow.) The related semantic view is that moral sentences are about\nthe speaker\u2019s (or someone else\u2019s) sentiments or\ndispositions to cause sentiments.\n\nThe simplest semantic account along these lines is Speaker\nSubjectivism, according to which the truth condition of an\nutterance of \u201cStealing is wrong\u201d is that the speaker\ndisapproves of stealing. This disapproval need not consist simply in a\nnegative sentiment towards stealing, but may also be thought of as\nendorsement of a moral standard or norm that prohibits stealing. In\nother words, the speaker reports the same attitude that\nexpressivists say the sentence expresses. This view is\nsuggested by some things that Hume says, in particular the\nfollowing:\n\n\n[W]hen you pronounce any action or character to be vicious, you mean\nnothing, but that from the constitution of your nature you have a\nfeeling or sentiment of blame from the contemplation of it. (T\n469)\n\n\nFor Speaker Subjectivism, there is a non-cognitive element to moral\njudgment, but moral sentences can nevertheless be given standard\ntruth-conditional semantics. Its attraction is thus making sense of\njudgment internalism without the need for non-standard semantics or\nmetasemantics. A generalized version of Speaker Subjectivism is\nMetaethical Contextualism, according to which the standard\nrelative to which something is said to be right or wrong need not be\nthe speaker\u2019s own, but is instead determined by the context of\nutterance, in something like the way that the context fixes the\ncontent of a tacitly indexical sentence like \u201cZheng is\ntall\u201d (Dreier 1990; Bj\u00f6rnsson and Finlay 2010). So just\nlike in uttering \u201cZheng is tall\u201d, we might say that Zheng\nis tall for a child, in uttering \u201cStealing is\nwrong\u201d we might say that stealing is wrong by the standards\nyou and I accept, for example.\n\nA basic objection to these views is the Missing Disagreement Problem\n(Moore 1912). Suppose that Ann says \u201cEating people is\nwrong\u201d and Beth, a committed cannibal, replies \u201cNo, eating\npeople is not wrong.\u201d According to simple Speaker Subjectivism,\nwhat Ann said is true if and only if Ann disapproves of eating people,\nand what Beth said is true if and only if Beth doesn\u2019t\ndisapprove of eating people. It can obviously be simultaneously true\nthat Ann disapproves of eating people and Beth doesn\u2019t, so their\nutterances don\u2019t contradict each other. Indeed, since what Ann\nsays is true on this picture, it looks like it should be possible for\nBeth to say \u201cWhat Ann says is true, but eating people is not\nwrong\u201d. So it seems they don\u2019t disagree any more than if\nAnn had said \u201cMy name begins with an A\u201d and Beth had said\n\u201cNo, my name begins with a B\u201d. Yet they do, so Speaker\nSubjectivism has a problem.\n\nContemporary subjectivists and contextualists are well aware of this\nproblem and offer various suggestions to solve it. For example,\nGilbert Harman\u2019s pragmatist response holds that when we say that\nsomething is wrong, we presuppose that the hearer shares our\nmoral standards (Harman 2000: 36). Our conversation is about what\nfollows from our standard, which is something something about which we\ncan genuinely disagree.\n\nWhatever we otherwise make of Harman\u2019s suggestion, the pragmatic\nstrategy appears to unduly restrict the scope of possible\ndisagreement, since it is possible to disagree with people who are not\npart of the conversation (Bj\u00f6rnsson and Finlay 2010). In\nresponse, subjectivists and contextualists sometimes give up the\nnotion that disagreement consists of contradictory beliefs, and\naccount for it in terms of the originally non-cognitivist notion of\ndisagreement in attitude (e.g. Finlay 2017). Assume, for\nsimplicity, that disapproval involves desire to have the agent\npunished, and approval a desire not to have the agent punished. Then,\neven if Ann\u2019s and Beth\u2019s utterances don\u2019t contradict\none another, they disagree in the sense that it is not possible to\nsimultaneously satisfy the desires entailed by the truth of their\nsincere utterances when they issue a verdict on cannibalism. If Ann\ngets her way, Beth doesn\u2019t, and vice versa.\n\nAnother question for Speaker Subjectivism is that the subject matter\nof the moral thought is not distinctively evaluative: if Ellen is a\nPresbyterian and thinks that stealing is wrong, the content of\nEllen\u2019s thought might be just that stealing is such as to arouse\ndisapproval in Presbyterians. Someone else could have a thought with\nthe same content without thereby making a moral evaluation of stealing\n(Egan 2012: 566). The evaluative aspect is external to the\nbelief, and consists rather in something like identifying as a\nPresbyterian, which involves a desire-like attitude towards avoiding\nthings that don\u2019t fit the Presbyterian moral code. Consequently,\nthere is no commitment to a distinct kind of evaluative fact. In Jamie\nDreier\u2019s (2009) view, this is an advantage rather than a problem\nfor the account.\n\nIdeal Dispositionalist views evade problems with Speaker\nSubjectivism with two moves. The first is idealization: the beliefs\nand sentences refer not to the speaker\u2019s views, but to those of\na suitably idealized subject (perhaps an idealized version of\nthe speaker). At the level of logical form, ought claims may have a\ntacit argument place for a standard, just as for contextualists\n\u2013 but the standard is context-invariant. The second is\ndispositionalization: the reference is not to anyone\u2019s actual\nsentiments, but to sentiments they would have in suitable\ncircumstances. Suggestions of this type of view can be found in Hume\nand Smith \u2013 recall their talk of correcting our\nsentiments by reference to the common point of view or the impartial\nspectator\u2019s response. Roderick Firth\u2019s (1952) Ideal\nObserver Theory is a more contemporary variant of this kind of\nview. In general form, it is as follows:\n\n\nTo judge that X has a moral property is to believe that any\nideal observer would have an ethically significant reaction to\nX in conditions ideal for doing so.\n\n\nBy an \u2018ethically significant reaction\u2019 Firth means\n\n\nthe kind of moral experience which we take to be evidence, under ideal\nconditions, for the truth of our ethical judgments. (Firth 1952:\n326)\n\n\nHe leaves it open whether the reaction is sentimental, so there are\npossible variants of Ideal Observer Theory that are not\nsentimentalist. In specifying the characteristics of the ideal\nobserver, Firth uses a \u2018pragmatic methodology\u2019 of\n\n\nexamining the procedures which we actually regard, implicitly or\nexplicitly, as the rational ones for deciding ethical questions.\n(ibid. 332)\n\n\nIf we actually disqualify someone\u2019s ethical verdicts because of\nignorance of non-moral facts, failure to vividly imagine what\nsomething would actually be like, partiality, non-moral emotions, and\ninconsistency, this shows that we implicitly regard moral judgements\nas valid only when made by an omniscient, omnipercipient, impartial,\ndispassionate, consistent, but otherwise normal judge (ibid.\n333\u2013345). These are then the characteristics of the ideal\nobserver.\n\nIdeal Dispositionalist views avoid the Missing Disagreement Problem.\nFor example, if Ann believes that any informed impartial spectator\nwould disapprove of X and Beth believes it\u2019s not the\ncase that any informed impartial spectator would not disapprove of\nX, their beliefs contradict each other and they\nstraightforwardly disagree.\n\nHowever, this victory for idealized views is achieved by detachment\nfrom people\u2019s own actual attitudes, which leads to the Missing\nMotivation Problem. The attraction that simple subjectivism,\ncontextualism, and non-cognitivism share is that if moral thoughts\nconsist in attitudes or beliefs about standards one endorses, their\nputative non-contingent connection to motivation is unproblematic. But\nhow could beliefs about dispositions to cause sentimental\nresponses in ideal subjects necessarily motivate ordinary thinkers,\ngiven the Humean Theory of Motivation (Mackie 1980: 69)? Some might\nhave the desire to do what an impartial spectator would approve of,\nbut what about those who don\u2019t? As Richard Joyce (2013) has put\nit, it appears that one may be just as unmoved by such thoughts as by\nthe belief that drunken Vikings would mock the performance of an\naction, and quite rationally so.\n\nMichael Smith (1994; 1997) offers a distinctively rationalist\nresponse to this challenge by appealing to the idea that an agent is\nmore rational in the sense of coherence if she is motivated to do what\nshe believes her ideally rational and informed advisor would want her\nto do. It merits further exploration whether a sentimentalist view\ncould make a similar move. For example, an Adam Smithian suggestion\nwould be that an agent who believes that any impartial spectator would\ndesire her to do A and fails to desire to A is less\ncoherent than one who combines the belief with a desire to A.\nThis assumes that our beliefs about an ideal spectator\u2019s\nattitudes are inherently authoritative for us (and hence unlike\nbeliefs about Vikings), as Smith indeed thinks.\n",
