    "main_text": "Political Philosophy || The Legal Issues\n8.2 The Legal Issues\n\nAccording to Roman law, as formulated in the Code of Justinian,\n\u201cownership\u201d and \u201clegitimate use\u201d cannot be\npermanently separated. For example, it is one thing for me to own a\nbook but to let you use it for a while. Ownership in that case means\nthat I can recall the book, and even if I do not do so, you should\nreturn it to me when you are done with it. But it is quite another\nmatter for me to own the book but to grant you permanent use\nof it, to agree not to recall it as long as you want to keep it, and\nto agree that you have no obligation to give it back ever.\nJohn XXII points out that, from the point of view of Roman law, the\nlatter case makes no sense. There is no practical difference in that\ncase between your having the use of the book and your owning it; for\nall intents and purposes, it is yours.\n\nNotice the criticism here. It is a legal argument against the claim\nthat the Papacy as an institution can own something and yet the\nFranciscans as an order, collectively, have a permanent right to use\nit. The complaint is not against the notion that an\nindividual friar might have a right to use something until he dies, at\nwhich time use reverts to the order (or as the Franciscans would have\nit, to the Papacy). This would still allow some distinction between\nownership and mere use. Rather the complaint is against the notion\nthat the order would not own anything outright, but would nevertheless\nhave permanent use of it that goes beyond the life or death of any\nindividual friar, so that the ownership somehow remained permanently\nwith the Papacy, even though the Pope could not reclaim it, use it, or\ndo anything at all with it. John XXII argues that this simply\nabolishes the distinction between use and ownership.\n",
