    "main_text": "Main Ideas || Observer and measurement\n1.3 Observer and measurement\n\nIn textbook presentations, quantum mechanics is about measurement\noutcomes performed when an \u201cobserver\u201d makes a\n\u201cmeasurement\u201d on a quantum system. What is an observer, if\nall physical systems are quantum? What counts as a measurement? Common\nanswers invoke the observer being macroscopic, onset of decoherence,\nirreversibility, registration of information, or similar. RQM does not\nutilise anything of the sort. Any system, irrespectively of its size,\ncomplexity or else, can play the role of the textbook\u2019s quantum\nmechanical observer. The \u201cmeasurement outcomes\u201d of a given\nobserver, however, refer only to values of the variables of the\nquantum system relative to that system. In particular, they do not\naffect events relative to other systems. In the same spirit, textbook\npresentations of quantum mechanics refer to \u201cmeasurement\noutcomes\u201d. In the relational interpretation, any interaction\ncounts as a measurement, to the extent one system affects the other\nand this influence depends on a variable of the first system. Every\nphysical object can be taken as defining a perspective, to which all\nvalues of physical quantities can be referred.\n\nAccording to RQM, therefore, quantum mechanics is not a theory of the\ndynamics of an entity \\(\\psi\\), from which the world of our experience\nsomehow emerges. It is instead a theory about the standard world of\nour experience, described by values that conventional physical\nvariables take at interactions, and about the transition probabilities\nthat determine which values are likely to be realized, given that\nothers were.\n",
