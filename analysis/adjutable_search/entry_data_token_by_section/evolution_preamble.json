    "main_text": "\n\nEvolution in its contemporary meaning in biology typically refers to\nthe changes in the proportions of biological types in a population\nover time (see the entries on\n evolutionary thought before Darwin\nand\n Darwin: from Origin of Species to Descent of Man\n for earlier meanings). As evolution is too large of a topic to\naddress thoroughly in one entry, the primary goal of this entry is to\nserve as a broad overview of contemporary issues in evolution with\nlinks to other entries where more in-depth discussion can be found.\nThe entry begins with a brief survey of definitions of evolution,\nfollowed by a discussion of the different modes of evolution and\nrelated philosophical issues, and ends with a summary of other topics in\nthe philosophy of evolution focusing particularly on topics\ncovered in this encyclopedia.\n",
