    "main_text": "Al-Kind\u012b and His School\n3. Al-Kind\u012b and His School\n\nAl-Kind\u012b (d. after 870) engaged in a taxonomic approach to\nAristotle\u2019s corpus, on the basis of a number of\nunidentified Greek sources of Neoplatonic heritage (Treatise on\nthe Quantity of Aristotle\u2019s Books and What is Required to Attain\nPhilosophy, Ris\u0101la f\u012b kammiyyat kutub\nAris\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6d\u0101l\u012bs wa-m\u0101 yu\u1e25ta\u01e7u\nilayhi f\u012b ta\u1e25\u1e63\u012bl al-falsafa). In this\ntreatise, he expresses an ambivalent view of the place of the\nMetaphysics in the corpus, by presenting\nAristotle\u2019s work as the culmination of a four-fold division of\nphilosophy into mathematics, logic, physics, and metaphysics, but also\nas preliminary to the knowledge of ethics. The description of the\ncontent of the Metaphysics is limited to the part of this\nwork dealing with philosophical theology (the study of immaterial\nthings), and contains explicit references to Islamic tenets such as\nGod\u2019s oneness, the divine names, and providence.\n\nDue to the loss of what might have been a specific commentary on the\nMetaphysics (attested under the title of Inclusive\nPhilosophy, Falsafa d\u0101\u1e2bila), the exegetical tendencies\nof al-Kind\u012b can only be guessed. His extant works on metaphysics\nindicate the adoption of the paraphrase as explanatory technique, and\na special attention to book Alpha Elatton (II, the first book of the\nMetaphysics in the Arab tradition), intended as introductory\nto the theological themes of book Lambda.\n\nAl-Kind\u012b\u2019s main metaphysical treatise (Book on First\nPhilosophy, Kit\u0101b f\u012b l-falsafa\nal-\u016bl\u0101, only partially extant) displays monotheistic\nconcerns (the insistence on the theme of God\u2019s unity, with\nrecourse to a model of the God-world relationship reminiscent of the\nNeoplatonic metaphysics of Theologia Aristotelis and\nLiber de causis), and the adoption of the doctrine of the\ncreation of the universe in time (derived from Philoponus). The\nexplicit encomiastic references to Aristotle occurring at the\nbeginning (with extensive paraphrastic excerpts of\nMetaphysics Alpha Elatton) and the abrupt switch to the\nthemes of Book Lambda (albeit treated in an un-Aristotelian vein)\nconfirm that the one-sided theologizing approach to the\nMetaphysics is directed at showing the compatibility of Greek\nmetaphysics with Islamic religion. Thus, al-Kind\u012b often portrays\nphilosophy in general, and metaphysics in particular, as the\ndiscipline deputed to give full articulation and rational explanation\nto the miraculous conciseness of the prophetic message (besides the\ncentral section of On the Quantity of Aristotle\u2019s\nBooks, see also the Epistle on the Explanation of the\nProsternation of the Extreme Body and its Obedience to God,\nRis\u0101la f\u012b l-Ib\u0101na \u02bfan su\u01e7\u016bd al-\u01e7irm\nal-aq\u1e63\u0101 wa-\u1e6d\u0101\u02bfatih\u012b\nli-ll\u0101hi).\n\nThe view of metaphysics as essentially a science of the divine being,\nrather than of being in general, and the intent of underscoring its\naffinity, once assimilated with philosophical theology, with Islam,\nwas also characteristic of al-Kind\u012b\u2019s direct disciples and\nthe \u201cschool\u201d of authors inspired by his teaching or\ndependent on his same sources. This is evident both in classifications\nof the sciences (Qus\u1e6d\u0101 ibn L\u016bq\u0101, d. 912; Ibn\nFar\u012b\u0121\u016bn, 10th century, the Ras\u0101\u02beil\nof the I\u1e2bw\u0101n al-\u1e62af\u0101\u02be, written around\n961\u2013986; Miskawayh, d. 1030), and in independent treatises\nrelated to metaphysics (see Ab\u016b Sulaym\u0101n\nal-Man\u1e6diq\u012b al-Si\u01e7ist\u0101n\u012b, d. ca. 985, and his\nschool; Ab\u016b l-\u1e24asan Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Y\u016bsuf\nal-\u02bf\u0100mir\u012b, d. 992).\n",
