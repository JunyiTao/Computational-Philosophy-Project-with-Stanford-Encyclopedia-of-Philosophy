    "main_text": "Philosophy of Physics || The Direction of Time (1956)\n4.6 The Direction of Time (1956)\n\nAs early as 1925, Reichenbach had essayed a probabilistic account of\nthe direction of time (1925d) and in 1931 he still endorsed it,\nrejecting on familiar reversibility grounds proposals to rely on\nentropy increase. (1931i, 1978, vol. I, p. 336). His final work,\nalmost completed at his death, was on the direction of time. \n\nReichenbach did not doubt that we have a definite psychological\nseparation of time into past and future, corresponding respectively to\nevents that can and cannot be remembered. His concern in The\nDirection of Time is for a physical basis for the same asymmetry:\n\n\nThe problem which the physicist faces can be formulated as follows.\nThe elementary processes of statistical thermodynamics, the motions\nand collisions of molecules, are supposed to be controlled by the laws\nof classical mechanics and are therefore reversible, the\nmacroprocesses are irreversible, as we know. How can this\nirreversibility of macroprocesses be reconciled with the reversibility\nof microprocesses? (p. 109)\n\n\nThe issues of a specific physical explanation of the psychological\nasymmetry, and of how there can be a changing psychological\npresent\u2014a moving \u201cnow\u201d\u2014were to have been\naddressed in an unwritten final chapter. \n\nReichenbach offers three accounts of the direction of time. The first\nis that the direction of time in a region of space-time is the most\ncommon direction of increasing entropy among multiple nearly isolated\nsystems in that region. The idea, as Reichenbach notes, is\nBoltzmann\u2019s. The second answer is that the direction of time is\nthat in which causal events turn high entropy systems into low\nentropy, ordered systems. In the reverse direction of the same\nprocess, he says, from low entropy to high entropy, the sequence of\nevents is not causal but \u201cpurposive.\u201d Thus stepping in\nsand makes a shape (low entropy) from a flat surface (high entropy).\nThe reverse process, removing the foot from the sand followed by the\nfoot impression filling with sand is not causal, but purposive. We do\nnot pretend to understand this argument. The third argument intends to\nproduce a direction of time from causal directions inferred from\nmacrostatistics. This is the perhaps the aspect of the book most often\ndiscussed, and it both breaks new ground and occasionally stumbles in\nthe furrows. \n\nReichenbach argues that spatially and temporally close coincidences of\ntwo causal processes suffice to determine that the coincidence is\neither a common cause or a common effect of two other events. (He\npostpones the issue of how it can be known that there is any causal\nconnection between remote events.) He claims, correctly, that this\nimplies that a causally connected network\u2014an acyclic directed\ngraph\u2014of events can have only two orientations; reversing any\nedge requires reversing all other edges to yield an equivalent\ndirected graph. In an anticipation of 21st century discussions\n(Woodward, 2003), he considers whether interventions can disambiguate\ncause from effect in such a network, and argues that they cannot, on\ncounterfactual considerations that are not entirely clear to us. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s discussion of the relations of probability and\ncausality was begun in his doctoral thesis, and continued in his 1925\npaper (Reichenbach 1925d) which, until The Direction of Time,\nhe often cited himself with approval. In The Direction of\nTime Reichenbach acknowledges that the 1925 claims were incorrect\nand formulates a new \u201cPrinciple of the Common Cause\u201d this\nway: \u201cIf an improbable coincidence has occurred, there must\nexist a common cause\u201d (p. 157). In any instance, he says, the\nconclusion of the principle is not certain but only probable, the more\nprobable the more frequent the coincidences. He formulates four\nconditions he says are satisfied when an association of simultaneous\noccurrences of A and B is due to a common cause,\nC, simultaneous with neither A nor B:\nC is not independent of A or of B, but\nA and B are independent conditional on C\nand also independent conditional on ~C. He says the principle\nis sometimes used in a weaker sense, requiring only that the\nprobability of A and of B be raised by the\noccurrence of C, but he says, that the independence can\nusually be established \u201cby the use of a more detailed\ndescription [of] the cause C\u201d (p. 161, n.2).\nReichenbach does not say that his conditions are sufficient for\nC to be a common cause of A and B, and as\nArtzenius has noted, they are not (Artzenius 1993 and the entry\n Reichenbach\u2019s common cause principle).\n \n\nUsing the principle, Reichenbach considers how to distinguish\nstructures I and II below: \n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering only binary variables, Reichenbach says in structure I,\nthe common cause case, A and B are not individually\nindependent of C (the probability of each is greater\nconditional on C than conditional on ~C), but\nA and B are independent of one another conditional\non C and on ~C. He\nclaims\u2014erroneously\u2014that these facts do not distinguish\nbetween I and II, and indeed are typical of causal structures such as\nII. Using an example with the structure III he writes: \u201cFor\ninstance, the spouting of the geysers may have the effect that two\nclouds are formed which merge into one large cloud. Then the\noccurrence of this large cloud is an effect E which satisfies\n[the probability properties of I]\u201d (p. 162). This is an\nimportant mistake. In structure III, representing the causal structure\nof the geyser cloud example, A and B are independent\nconditional on D, but for almost all probability\ndistributions, A and B are not independent\nconditional on C and D. That is, III\nimplies (for almost all probability distributions) that none of\nA, B, C, D are independent, that\nA, B are independent conditional on D, and\nthat A, B are not independent conditional on\nC or on C and D. If the directions of edges\nin III are reversed, as in IV, the same relations hold, but with\nC and D interchanged. The direction of the causal\nrelations between the eruption and the formation of the large cloud is\nthus encoded in the conditional probability relations. Reichenbach\nmangles the relationships in a confused passage: \n\n\u2026if there exists a conjunctive fork with respect to a common\neffect E [as in structure II, with E in place of\nC], the simultaneous occurrence of A and B\nis more probable than a mere chance coincidence. Consequently, if\nthere were no common cause C [D in structure III],\nthe common effect would establish a statistical dependence between\nA and B and explanation would be given in terms of a\n\u201cfinal cause\u201d. \u2026we regard final causes as\nincompatible with the second law of thermodynamics and consider such\nforks impossible\u2026.this means: The principle of the common cause\ndoes not exclude, throughout, a statistical dependence with respect to\na common effect; but it does exclude such dependence if there exists\nno common cause. (p. 162)\n\n\nThus Reichenbach seems to think that in II above, A and\nB are independent conditional on C, but in III,\nA and B are dependent conditional on C and\nthe absence of D. Reichenbach\u2019s confusions on these\npoints is understandable\u2014well into the 1990s much the same could\nbe heard from several statisticians. In order to see the correct\nrelations, Reichenbach would have had to have explicitly formulated\nthe factorization of the joint distribution for binary variables that\nis implicit in his other discussions, and computed the joint\ndistribution of independent causes conditional on values of a common\neffect. He did not. Alternatively, with linear systems it is trivial\nto calculate the partial correlations of the causes controlling for\nthe effect, but Reichenbach undoubtedly did not know the formulas.\n\n\nHe continues with an illustration of \u201cscreening off\u201d and a\ndefinition of \u201ccausally between\u201d for events. The\nillustration is a causal chain A \u2192 B \u2192\nC. A and C are independent conditional on\nthe occurrence of B. He does not say that \u201cscreening\noff\u201d requires that A and C are also\nindependent conditional on ~B, but his statement of the\nPrinciple of the Common Cause strongly suggests as much. He defines\n\u201ccausally between\u201d as follows: \n\n\nDefinition 1. An event A2 is causally between the\nevents A1 and A3 if the\nrelations hold:\n\n1 > P(A2, A3)\n> P(A1, A3) >\nP(A3) > 0\n1 > P(A2, A1)\n> P(A3, A1) >\nP(A1) > 0\nP(A1. A2,\nA3) = P(A2,\nA3)\n\n\n(p. 190)\n\n\nRecall that the dot is conjunction, and\nP(A2, A3) in\nReichenbach\u2019s notation is P(A3 |\nA2) = P(A3.\nA2) / P(A2) in the\ncurrently conventional notation. Reichenbach goes on to claim that a\ncommon effect of two causes is causally between its two causes, thus\nA1 \u2192 A2 \u2190\nA3, which is obviously false if absence of any\ncausal connection implies independence. Throughout his life,\nReichenbach implicitly makes this assumption in his examples about\ncausal relations. With such an assumption, it follows that\nP(A1. A3) =\nP(A1)\u2009P(A3)\n\u2265 P(A1, A3) =\nP(A1)P(A3)/P(A3)\n= P(A1), contradicting (1) in the\ndefinition. One may take these and other examples as evidence that\nReichenbach did not have in mind instances of what is now called the\ncausal Markov condition\u2014that conditional on its relatively\ndirect causes a variable is independent of variables that are not its\neffects\u2014or, alternatively, that he was simply confused about the\nproperties of \u201ccolliders\u201d\u2014common effects\u2014in\ncausal graphs. We prefer the latter interpretation. \n\nCausal direction in a network is now determined by supposing an\nasymmetrical intervention is available, which Reichenbach calls a\n\u201cmark.\u201d Marks are assumed to be passed down causal chains,\nand to imply an increase in the probability of each downstream event.\nUsing the time order so obtained, \u201ccausal relevance\u201d is\ndefined as: \n\n\nDefinition 2: An event A1 is causally relevant to\na later event A3 if\nP(A1, A3) >\nP(A3) and there exists no set of events\nA2(1),\u2026,\nA2(n) which are earlier than\nor simultaneous with A1 such that this set screens\noff A1 from A3. (p. 204) \n\n\nDefinition 2 provides a clear anticipation of a proposal made 20 years\nlater by Patrick Suppes (Suppes, 1970). The Direction of Time\nends with a discussion of quantum statistical mechanics focused on\nissues of the identity of particles through time. \n",
