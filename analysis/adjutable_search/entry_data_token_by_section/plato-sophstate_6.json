    "main_text": "The Problem of the Sophist || The Angler and the Sophist\n4.1 The Angler and the Sophist\n\n\nThe paradigm of the angler demonstrates the method of dichotomous \ndivision and steers the first attempt to define the sophist. An \nangler has a humble profession, familiar to everyone \n(Sophist 218e): an angler hunts water creatures using a \nspecial sort of hook. The visitor arrives at his definition by first \nlocating the angler\u2019s profession in a wide kind, art or expertise \n(techn\u00ea). He divides art into two subordinate kinds, \nproductive and acquisitive, then continues to divide the acquisitive \nbranch until he reaches the terminus, where he finds angling marked \noff as what it is, apart from everything else. The sophist resembles \nthe angler in possessing expertise, but more intimately as well. He, \ntoo, is a sort of hunter, but one who hunts terrestrial creatures \nrather than aquatic. The Stranger first defines the sophist as a \nhired hunter of rich young men (Sophist 223b; 231d).\n\n\nSo far angling seems well suited to direct the inquirers toward their\ngoal. Set on the right track, they readily complete the rest of the \ndivision. But at the end of the first division, the Stranger remarks \nthat the sophist\u2019s art is really quite complicated (Sophist 223c). He then \nturns his attention to a feature mentioned toward the end of that \ndivision. The sophist earns wages from those he hunts, and he has a \nproduct to sell. Returning to acquisitive art, the Stranger this time\nignores the branch that leads to hunting, and instead follows the \nother branch, beginning from the art of acquisition by exchange, and \ndefines the sophist as someone engaged in commerce, who sells \nproducts for the soul (Sophist 224c\u2013d; 231d). In the pages following, the \nStranger focuses on various activities of the sophist and \ndefines him in five different ways. Each time the sophist turns up at\nthe tips of branches stemming from acquisitive art. Then on a sixth \nround the Stranger makes a fresh initial division of art, marking off\nthe art of separation, and finds the sophist at the terminus of a \nbranch originating from there.\n\n\nWhat should we make of the fact that the sophist turns up all over the\ntree, and not at a single terminus like the angler? The angler differs\nfrom the sophist in two main respects. First, the essence of the\nangler is evident from his activity and is easy to spell out using\ndichotomous division. As the Stranger says in the Statesman\n(see above \u00a7 2), some things are easily pictured: we can perceive\nthe angler\u2019s essential activity, fishing by means of a special hook,\nand readily depict it. The essence of the sophist, too, might seem\neasy to picture from his activities. He engages in many observable\nactivities, so it seems appropriate to define him in a number of\nways. But the essence of the sophist, as we soon discover, is none of\nthose things. His essential activity cannot be pictured, as angling\ncan. Second, the nature of angling is uncontroversial, and the\nStranger and Theaetetus mean the same thing by the name\n(Sophist 218e). By contrast, people have various conceptions\nof what sophistry is, witnessed by the numerous divisions. They may\nalso disagree about what individuals fall under the kind. Because\nsophistry is a disputed notion, people may have different conceptions\nof it, and some conceptions may be simply mistaken.\n",
