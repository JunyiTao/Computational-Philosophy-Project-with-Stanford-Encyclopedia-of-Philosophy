X-Phi and the Doing/Allowing Distinction\n\nThe majority of work on the doing/allowing distinction has appealed to\nthe author or reader\u2019s own intuitions about cases. However, some\nwork has used experimental data in relation to the doing/allowing\ndistinction. This is part of a wider phenomenon of use of empirical\ndata in philosophy known as \u2018X-Phi\u2019. \n\nKahneman and Tversky\u2019s (1983) experiment asked respondents to\nchoose between treatment plans for a deadly disease expected to kill\n600 people. The first set of respondents must choose between:\n\nOption (A): 200 people will be saved.\nOption (B): There is a 1/3 probability that 600 people will be\nsaved and a 2/3 probability that no one will be saved.\n\n\n72% of people prefer (A) and 28% of people prefer (B). The second\ngroups of respondents were asked to choose between:\n\nOption (C): 400 people will die.\nOption (D): There is a 1/3 probability that no one will die and a\n2/3 probability that 600 people will die.\n\n\nThis time, 22% preferred C and 78% preferred D.\n\nThe results are striking because (A) is the same outcome as (C) and\n(B) is the same outcome as (D). The outcomes are simply described\ndifferently.\n\nKahneman and Tversky (1984) argue that such experiments show that we\nattached greater disvalue to a loss than to the absence of a gain (a\nno-gain). Different descriptions of the same outcome lead to different\nresponses by changing the baseline, affecting whether the outcome is\nperceived as a loss or a no-gain. These results may seem to threaten\nthe relevance of the doing/allowing distinction: first by suggesting\nthat the intuitions that supported the doing/allowing distinction can\nbe explained by the loss/no-gain preference; second, by undermining\nthe reliability of these intuitions. See Sinnott-Armstrong (2008);\nHorowitz (1998).\n\nHowever, as Kamm (2007) argues, the doing /allowing distinction seems\nto be intuitively morally relevant independently of the loss/no-gain\ndistinction. Imagine I am driving five healthy people to hospital to\nreceive anti-venom against the plague of poisonous snakes that will\nhit town and kill all unprotected people in a few hours; I will not\nreach the hospital in time unless I drive over the one healthy person\nwho is blocking my road. It seems intuitively impermissible for me to\nkill the one to save the five \u2013 even though all victims face\nlosses. \n\nKamm (2007) also argues that the correct application of the\ndoing/allowing distinction is not affected by framing effects: except\nin cases of overdetermination, the correct baseline for the\ndoing/allowing distinction is determined by what would happen if the\nagent did not intervene. Colombo (2018) argues that Kamm\u2019s\nassurance depends upon prior acceptance of a particular account of the\ndoing/allowing distinction. Nonetheless, Colombo argues, this need not\nundermine our appeal to intuitions in support of the doing/allowing\ndistinction: our intuitions may be generally trustworthy even if\nborderline cases are subject to framing effects.\n\nCushman et al (2008) claim that their experimental data shows that\nmoral appraisals affect classification of behaviour as doing or\nallowing. Cushman et al do not see this as presenting a special\nchallenge for the doing/allowing distinction. They see these findings\nas adding to \u201ca growing list of folk concepts influenced by\nmoral appraisal, including causation and intentional action\u201d\nconcluding that: \u201cthe present finding favors the view that moral\nappraisal plays a pervasive role in shaping diverse cognitive\nrepresentations across multiple domains\u201d (Cushman et al 2008,\n281).\n\nBarry et al (2014) use empirical studies to support the 3rd\ncategory approach to safety net cases. They argue that empirical\nstudies show that removing a barrier to harm (enabling) is treated as\na distinct category, both morally and conceptually distinct from doing\nand allowing. Most philosophical work on the doing/allowing\ndistinction seeks to reflect something that is claimed to be part of\ncommonsense morality while noting that common intuitions about\nparticular cases could be incorrect. Given this, there are interesting\nquestions about how to respond to such empirical studies: does the\nfact that enabling is treated as a distinct category settle whether it\nis a distinct category for the purposes of the defender (or critic) of\nthe doing/allowing distinction? \n",
