    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\n Sapa\u1e47[1]\n was the fourth of the \u201cFive Great Throneholders\u201d of Sakya\n(Tib. sa-skya), the monastery that was the seat of the noble\nKh\u00f6n clan and the institutional hub for one of the main schools\nof Tibetan Buddhism. The first of the five was Sapa\u1e47\u2019s\ngrandfather, Sachen Kunga Nyingpo, and the second and third were his\nuncles Sonam Tsemo and Drakpa Gyeltsen. His uncles were both celibate\nmonks, so the royal line fell naturally to him, the eldest nephew.\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s biographies contain hagiographical fancy that\nassimilates his early life to that of the Buddha or other great\nintellects: His mother dreamed of a crowned N\u0101ga king coming to\nher when Sapa\u1e47 entered her womb; as an infant he spoke and wrote\nSanskrit; as a child he was gentle and compassionate, knew many topics\nwithout having studied them, and imbibed the dharma without effort. As\nhe grew (and we enter more realistic history), he received teachings\nfrom many great masters both within his family and abroad, and he\ncontinued to distinguish himself for his preternaturally quick\nmastery, sharp discernment, and elegant instruction. In dreams, he had\nvisions confirming his abilities at understanding the works of\nVasubandhu and Dign\u0101ga.\n\nA major turning point in his life came when the Kashmiri scholar\n\u015a\u0101kya\u015br\u012bbhadra arrived in Tibet with an entourage\nof pa\u1e47\u1e0ditas from India and Nepal. Sapa\u1e47\nwent to meet him and established a crucial relationship with these\nscholars. He was able to hire one of the\npa\u1e47\u1e0ditas, Sugata\u015br\u012b, as a personal\ntutor for three years, and then return to study with\n\u015a\u0101kya\u015br\u012b for another five years. It was with these\nscholars that Sapa\u1e47 came to master the linguistic\nsciences\u2014Sanskrit grammar, poetics, and metrics\u2014but also,\nand especially, epistemology (tshad ma). Sapa\u1e47 was said\nto have had various doubts and questions about the understanding of\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s philosophy that he had received from his\nearly teachers, which were resolved by his studies under\n\u015a\u0101kya\u015br\u012b. He learned to translate under the\ntutelage of Sugata\u015br\u012b, and then together with\n\u015a\u0101kya\u015br\u012b retranslated Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika into Tibetan.\n\nBefore Sapa\u1e47, Sakya was a renowned center for the study of the\nLamdre system of the Hevajra Tantra, rooted in the\nmasterful works and reputation of Sachen Kunga Nyingpo. Sapa\u1e47\nestablished Sakya anew as a leader in the study of epistemology.\nSapa\u1e47 engaged in many public, spirited debates with members of\nrival Tibetan schools and, famously, with visiting Brahmanical\npa\u1e47\u1e0ditas (including one *Harinanda), whom he is\nsaid to have defeated (see Hugon 2012 on this event). His personal\nreputation, and the tantric reputation of Sakya, were surely important\nfactors behind the Mongol prince K\u00f6den inviting him to negotiate\nterms for the Tibetan surrender in 1244. It is not entirely clear just\nwhat the terms turned out to be, and Sapa\u1e47 died in the Mongol\ncapital. But just a few years later, Sapa\u1e47\u2019s nephew\nPhakpa, whom he had brought with him, was named supreme administrator\nof a united Tibet under Mongol rule\u2014a position that stayed with\nthe Sakya for a century (Wylie 1977 [2003] and Petech 1990).\n\nSapa\u1e47 composed many short works, but he is best known for five major\nworks: \n\n Treasury of Aphoristic Jewels (Legs par bshad pa rin\npo che\u2019i gter; Bosson 1969); \n Treasury of Epistemological Reasoning (Tshad ma rigs\npa\u2019i gter; Fukuda et al. 1989\u20131994 and Hugon\n2008);\n Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes (Sdom gsum\nrab dbye; Rhoton 2002); \n Clarifying the Sage\u2019s Intent (Thub pa\u2019i\ndgongs pa rab tu gsal; D. Jackson 2015); and \n Gateway to Learning (Mkhas pa rnams \u2019jug pa\u2019i\nsgo; D. Jackson 1987 and Gold 2007). \n\n\nThe first is a popular collection of pithy sayings and moral\ninstructions (Kolma\u0161 1978); the others are treated further\nbelow. Although it is difficult to summarize his worldview, it is\nhoped that this survey reveals a philosopher of remarkable\nconsistency, vision and depth.\n2. Epistemology and Philosophy of Language: The Treasury of Reasoning\n2.1 Introduction to the Work\n\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s Treasury of Epistemological\n Reasoning[2]\n is one of Tibet\u2019s best known and most consequential\nphilosophical achievements, roundly extolled as a work of genius and\nvalidation of Sapa\u1e47\u2019s reputation as an emanation of\nMa\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b, the bodhisattva of wisdom. It is an\nunrivaled touchstone for Tibetan approaches to concept formation,\nphilosophy of language, cognition and perception. Still, the work has\nan ambiguous legacy. Like the Three Vows, it was mired in\ncontroversy from its debut\u2014controversy around a number of its\nstridently combative positions, but especially, and without end,\ncontroversy around its meaning. What\u2019s more, at least some of\nits advocates were false friends, appropriating the glow of\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s legacy while making only selective use of the\nwork\u2019s masterful exposition of Dharmak\u012brti and, especially,\nturning a blind eye to crucial particulars that might call into\nquestion their own cherished\n doctrines.[3]\n Recent scholarship has begun to reveal the work\u2019s own goals and\nplace it within its intellectual contexts, but the project is complex\nand ongoing. This section is, of necessity, only a sketch.\n\nThe Treasury is staunchly anti-realist about both cognitive\nand linguistic objects. Nominalism and pragmatism are hardly outside\nthe range of expectation for a Buddhist. Yet Tibetans both before and\nafter Sapa\u1e47 (esp. Chapa before, Tsongkhapa after) have tended to\nhew to a more intuitive and \u201cmoderate\u201d realism\u2014to\nuse Georges Dreyfus\u2019 terminology (1997). Sapa\u1e47 defends a\nposition that is more spare and more severe than most Tibetan\nepistemologists, and, according to modern scholarship, closer to\n Dharmak\u012brti.[4]\n Buddhist traditions are widely known for their insistence that\nordinary beings are uniformly deluded and reality seen correctly by a\nBuddha is entirely beyond their (our) ken, so the counter-intuitive\nnature of anti-realism is not at all discomforting to the Indic\nBuddhist mainstream. Sapa\u1e47 certainly considered his own views\nmore accurate and more authentically Indian than those of his Tibetan\nadversaries. This self-understanding was, no doubt, buttressed by the\nfact that he had studied Sanskrit and Indian linguistic sciences with\nthe followers of the Kashmiri scholar\n\u015a\u0101kya\u015br\u012bbhadra and that with\n\u015a\u0101kya\u015br\u012b he had retranslated, and thereby\nrejuvenated the study of, Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika. Association with great\nIndian pa\u1e47\u1e0ditas gave Sapa\u1e47 the confidence\nto distinguish his own conservative stance from ideas he disparagingly\ncalled \u201cTibetan\u201d innovations.\n\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s main adversaries in his Treasury were\nadherents of the tradition of Ngok (rngog lugs) centered in\nSangpu (gsang-phu) monastery, whose most prominent advocates\nwere Ngog Lotsawa himself and his disciple Chapa Chokyi Senge. As\nChapa\u2019s epistemology gained ascendancy, study of the\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika was apparently eclipsed by\nthat of other writings of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s (primarily the\nPram\u0101\u1e47avini\u1e63caya), and this perhaps had the\neffect of these thinkers losing sight of the key Buddhist\nphilosophical ingredient for a strong anti-realist view: concept\nformation via exclusion\n (any\u0101poha).[5]\n Whatever the cause, the significance of this piece of Buddhist\nepistemology seems to have been missed or downplayed by Chapa and his\n followers.[6]\n Sapa\u1e47\u2019s Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika\nrenaissance helped to bring the doctrine of apoha back into\nthe center of Buddhist epistemology and thereby resisted the rising\ntide of moderate realism. The great Tsongkhapa (1357\u20131419), more\nthan a century later, rejuvenated moderate realism in Tibet through a\nnew synthesis of epistemology with Madhyamaka.\n2.2 Concept Formation in the Treasury\n\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s strict nominalism rejects the reality of cognitive\nand linguistic objects, which makes him an \u201cillusionist\u201d\nabout the mind. Where Daniel Dennett (1991) criticizes the \u201cCartesian\ntheater\u201d model of the mind, in which images play across a mental\nscreen, Buddhist philosophers criticize the \u201cduality\u201d that\nconstitutes the subject/object binary. The notion of a cognitive\nobject, for this tradition, is intertwined with the false reification\nof the self, a cardinal Buddhist error. There could only be mental\nobjects if there were mental subjects; viewing subjects and mental\nobjects are attributable, together, to the tendency of ordinary beings\nmistakenly to project a \u201cself\u201d. Moreover, the utility of\nconcepts for language and thought would require that they be\nunchanging against the backdrop of the Buddhist view that all things\nare impermanent; if, as Sapa\u1e47 argues, they were impermanent,\nthey would be mind-dependent, and hence private objects (see Stolz\n2006). What needs to be explained, therefore, is not the reality of\nconcepts, but the causes that bring about their seeming to\nappear and function.\n\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhists believe that this fundamental error is\nrooted in beginningless karmic tendencies. Our minds have been\nconditioned by our previous actions, and we experience the world\nthrough their capacities and strictures. Our karmic conditioning\nprovides the conceptual nexus through which we think and communicate\nwith other beings who have similar karma and therefore similar\nconceptual tendencies. This karmic basis of conceptualization and\nlanguage, which finds them both to be pragmatically beneficial while\nfundamentally erroneous, is the lynchpin of Sapa\u1e47\u2019s\nphilosophical position in the Treasury. Against his\ncontemporaries, who rely upon concepts and linguistic objects being\nquasi-real entities in order to account for cognition and language,\nSapa\u1e47 explains the utility of concepts, and the linguistic\nentities to which they are tied, with reference to the same process\nthat makes them erroneous: the never-ending causal flow of karma. Like\nfloating hairs that appear due to ophthalmic disease, cognitive\nobjects are nothing but a failure in the system, and have no\nindependent reality.\n\nSapa\u1e47 is perhaps uniquely attuned to how decisively it is\nkarma that underwrites the doctrine of apoha, the\nBuddhist approach to concept formation in the light of emptiness. Not\neven Dharmak\u012brti, whose epistemology courted Buddhists of the\n\u015ar\u0101vakay\u0101na, was willing to be as vividly pragmatist.\nBe that as it may, Sapa\u1e47 makes constant reference to\nDharmak\u012brti and is reasonably seen to have provided a faithful\nextension of his views. Above all, Sapa\u1e47 maintains without\nexception the key ontological distinction in Buddhist epistemology\nbetween real, causally effective momentary particulars that are the\npotential objects of perception, and false conceptual constructions\nthat are the seeming objects of cognition. Where all of reality is\ndivided into these categories, we can see even by the definitions that\nconcepts and abstract objects must be unreal. Chapa and his followers\nspoke of intermediate categories of various kinds\u2014cognitive and\nperceptual objects that are not simply momentary bare\nparticulars\u2014and Sapa\u1e47 and his followers targeted them as\ninsufficient to a Buddhist view.\n\nThe motivation for these intermediate positions is not difficult to\nsee. With such a strict division between momentary perceptual\nparticulars and erroneous linguistic concepts, it is difficult to\nexplain how we could ever arrive at anything like knowledge. This is\nwhere Dign\u0101ga\u2019s doctrine of apoha is supposed to\nhelp. Although there are no real concepts and no linguistic\nuniversals, there are apparent universals that we\nmistakenly\u2014but pragmatically\u2014superimpose on real things.\nWe create concepts not by identifying some real quality or similarity\nthat is shared across distinct entities, but by ignoring most of their\ndifferences and \u201cexcluding\u201d non-members of a set from a\nconceptual field, outside a pragmatically beneficial boundary. A key\nquestion that arises to challenge this possibility is, How can a\nfallacious boundary be pragmatically beneficial? Why, for instance, is\na concept or a word recognized and shared by various people, if there\nis no real similarity among the objects to which it refers? The\nanswer, which as I\u2019ve said Sapa\u1e47 gives more explicitly\nthan any other thinker, is karma. The mistake of\nsuperimposing what is falsely taken to be a real general concept on an\nactually real particular which it is taken to represent works\nfor beings that tend to see things the same way:\n\nWith propensities beginninglessly habituated, and having generated the\npower for an error to appear, on the occasion of the sign, without\ndistinguishing the concepts and the particulars, one imputes the sign,\n\u201cThis is a pot\u201d. Later, if one says, \u201cPour the water\nin the pot\u201d, without asking, \u201cPour the water in the\nindividual pot, or pour it into the concept pot?\u201d one\nunderstands the object of engagement to be the very thing\n itself.[7]\n\n\nKarma also provides the answer to the question of how an unreal\nconcept can be stable in a changing mind, and across references to\ndistinct, changing entities. The answer is that concepts are no more\nstable than the \u201cself\u201d is a real, stable entity. Still,\ndue to karma, we have certain tendencies to experience the world in\nsimilarly-patterned modes. Through Buddhist practice, it is possible\nto overcome these; through Buddhist epistemology, it is possible to\nunderstand their erroneous yet beneficial applications. This expresses\na version of the Buddhist karmic causal theory of meaning that has\nbeen noted in Yog\u0101c\u0101ra thought (see Gold 2006 and Tzohar\n2017a, 2017b).\n3. Defending the Dharma: A Clear Differentiation of the Three Vows\n3.1 Introducing the Work\n\nThe Three\n Vows[8]\n is a polemical treatise, and it is Sapa\u1e47\u2019s most\ncontroversial work. It is an assemblage of distinct doctrinal\narguments directed against Sapa\u1e47\u2019s Tibetan contemporaries,\norganized under the rubric of three sets of vows. The categories of\nvows refer to the three main categories of Buddhist theory and\npractice: (1) Disciples\u2019 (\u015br\u0101vaka) monastic\nvows, (2) Great Vehicle (mah\u0101y\u0101na) or bodhisattva\nvows, and (3) Mantra/Tantra vows. Before it ever reached Tibet,\nBuddhism in India had developed through these three forms, each with\nits own more-or-less distinct philosophical and ritual framework. Even\nas later systems became preeminent, however, earlier stages of\nBuddhist practice were kept, integrated into lower rungs in a complex\n system.[9]\n Yet although Buddhist intellectuals in India and Tibet took on this\nsystematizing theoretical work, there was never a single institution\ncapable of preventing innovation and experimentation in ritual and\ndoctrine, and over the centuries numerous practices crossed the\nlines ideally set (often after the fact) between the categories. \nConsequently, there were evident divergences between\nidealized systems and their practiced realities, and many conservative\ninstitutional leaders in Tibet during the later diffusion period\n(spyi dar) sought to reign in all errors, but especially\nthose that upset the structured hierarchies of tantric Buddhism.\n\nIn the Three Vows, then, Sapa\u1e47\u2019s central concern\nwas to correct errors in his contemporaries\u2019 theories and\npractices, so as to preserve the integrity and the effectiveness of\nthe teachings. As mentioned above, Sapa\u1e47\u2019s linguistic\ntraining made him confident that he had a better understanding of\nauthentic, Indian sources than most of his contemporaries. He\ntherefore adopts a critical stance against what he considers Tibetan\ninnovations, but his concerns are not merely clerical, and he is not\nsimply nostalgic or obedient to tradition. Nor, if we take him at his\nword, is he simply writing for political gain. On the contrary, he\nprovides a vociferous defense of the use of scripture and reasoning to\nprotect Buddhist doctrine, and he emphasizes the unfairness of those\nwho would claim his critiques are motivated by hostility or jealousy\n(III.625ff.; Rhoton 2002: 178\u2013181). Rather, as he explains near\nthe end of the work, careful and informed analysis is crucial because\neven practices that closely resemble authentic ones can undermine the\nteachings, if they fail to properly follow key points (III.432; Rhoton\n2002: 152). In this context, he concisely summarizes the\n\u201cessentials\u201d he considers sacrosanct for each of the three\ntraditions: For the tradition of the Disciples, they are the monastic\nvows and the four truths; for the Great Vehicle, the thought of\nenlightenment and the discipline of the perfections; and for the\nMantra tradition, the initiation and the two processes of generation\nand completion. If you get these wrong, practice becomes essentially\nnon-Buddhist and most importantly, ineffective. He sees his critiques\nas, above all, practical soteriology.\n\nUnder this umbrella, Sapa\u1e47 lists ten fallacious doctrines, which\nhe considers a particular threat to the essential teachings in his\nday:\n\n Disciples\u2019 vows are taken to last until\nenlightenment;\n Mind-only rites for bodhisattvas are given to\nall;\n It is taught that bodhicitta (the\nbodhisattva\u2019s altruistic mindset) should not be cultivated in\nmeditation through the exchange of self and other;\n Initiations are deemed unnecessary for Mantra\npractice and are substituted with the Vajra Sow blessing;\n People have faith in teachers who have not cultivated\nthe two (tantric) processes;\n People are instructed not to visualize the\nguru on top of one\u2019s head;\n The Realm of Reality (dharmadh\u0101tu) is\nmade into an object of dedication, called \u201cexistent\nvirtue\u201d;\n Instead of means and emptiness, a state of bare\nnon-elaboration is taught, called \u201cthe White Self-sufficient\nRemedy\u201d;\n \u201cDreamed\u201d bodhicitta;\n Abrupt visualization of tutelary\n deities.[10]\n\n\n\nThese ten errors are by no means the limit of the topics covered in\nthe Three Vows, but they represent the kinds of issues that\nmotivate the work, and they stand at the center of Sapa\u1e47\u2019s\ndoctrinal disputes with his adversaries. Many of these are reiterated\nthroughout his works\u2014also appearing, for instance, as topics of\ndiscussion in the Sage\u2019s Intent or the Gateway to\nLearning. Here is not the place to examine each of these, which\nwould take us into some rather arcane particulars. Still, although\nmany of these points enact scholastic in-fighting and might seem on\nthe surface to be doctrinal angel-counting, Sapa\u1e47\u2019s\narguments generally present them as examples of larger concerns. The\ninteresting interpretive question for each, then, is how getting a\ngiven idea wrong disrupts the essentials of the teachings, and what\nthis tells us about Sapa\u1e47\u2019s approach to the doctrine and\nthe controversies of his time. Here I will focus on two critiques\n (1\n &\n 7)\n and mention a third\n (4).\n I will discuss Sapa\u1e47\u2019s view of\n (8)\n in the section on the Sage\u2019s Intent. These are\ninteresting in themselves, and should be sufficient to introduce\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s argumentative style and his philosophical approach\nin this work. I have taken extra space for this section of the entry\nto present\n (7),\n which is one of Sapa\u1e47\u2019s most important arguments, and to\ndiscuss the work\u2019s important, repeating defense of moral\ncontextualism.\n3.2 Distinguishing Great Vehicle from Disciples\u2019 Vows\n\n One point with which Sapa\u1e47 opens the Three Vows provides\nan elegant paradigm for what he means by the title\u2019s\n\u201cClear Differentiation\u201d of the three vows, or\n codes.[11] \nIt is a case where Tibetans of his day have \u201cmixed\u201d the\nDisciples\u2019 vows with the Great Vehicle\u2019s bodhisattva vows.\nNow, it is clear that Tibetans undertaking monastic vows had commonly\npaired the oral recitation that constitutes the adoption of monastic\nvows with a mental component, the generation of a Great Vehicle\nintention called bodhicitta\u2014the altruistic desire to\nachieve Buddhahood in order to save all beings from \n suffering.[12] \nSapa\u1e47 voices no complaint about this pairing of mental and\nphysical actions, but he rejects a mistaken conclusion about the\nduration of the vows that some of his contemporaries apparently\nderived from it.\n\nSapa\u1e47 argues that Disciples\u2019 vows (i.e., monastic vows)\nlast until death (when one\u2019s body dies), whereas the bodhisattva\nvows last beyond death, through subsequent rebirths\u2014as long as\none\u2019s mind persists. A counter-argument proposes that, if the\naltruistic intention is in place when they are recited, the\nDisciples\u2019 vows should also continue for as long as one\u2019s\nmind\n persists.[13]\n In reply, Sapa\u1e47 says that this contradicts authoritative texts\nthat distinguish between the different rites and rules for upholding\nthe Disciples\u2019 and Great Vehicle\n vows.[14]\n Furthermore, he says, if monastic vows lasted from life to life, then\ngods and babies who were reborn from the mental continua of deceased\nmonks would still be monks. Yet not only are such beings violating the\nrules of monkhood all the time, they are expressly forbidden from\nbecoming monks! Here we see a widespread mixture of practices leading\nto an unacceptable doctrinal confusion.\n\nThis may seem like a clever analysis without significant practical\nramifications. After all, I have no way of knowing whether I took a\nvow in a previous lifetime, and I cannot inform my future rebirth\nabout whether I have taken a vow in this life. But notice that the\nvows systems are distinguished by indicating the specific causes and\nresults on the path to liberation. Sapa\u1e47\u2019s basic point is\nthat Disciples\u2019 vows and Great Vehicle vows operate differently.\nThe practical benefit from such a \u201cdifferentiation\u201d, then,\nis the ability to articulate the different paths to liberation clearly\nand accurately.\n\nThis general concern with the operation of the paths leads, in the\nnext section, to a broader definition of\nkarma\u2014action-and-result\u2014and its associated terminology.\nSapa\u1e47 begins with the crucial distinction between actions, which\nare produced and bring about happiness or pain as their result, and\nthe unconditioned, actionless, Realm of Reality or Dharmadh\u0101tu.\nSince wholesomeness is a quality of an action that is determined by\nthe happiness or pain that the action causes, he says, the causeless\nDharmadh\u0101tu is neither wholesome nor unwholesome. This\nconsequentialism about wholesomeness or virtue, set against a backdrop\nof an unchanging, literally \u201cinconsequential\u201d ultimate\nreality, launches the most extensive, detailed argument of the work:\nthe argument against the ultimate reality of virtue.\n3.3 Against the Ultimate Reality of Virtue\n\nLike other arguments in the Three Vows, Sapa\u1e47\u2019s\ndisproof of the ultimate reality of virtue is a targeted critique of\nhis Tibetan\n contemporaries.[15]\n In this case, the discussion revolves around a verse from the\nVajradhvaja S\u016btra, in which there is a dedication of all\nbeings\u2019 virtue in the three times (the quote is something like,\n\u201cas much as exists in the past, present and future\u201d).\nOrdinarily, in the Great Vehicle, one altruistically dedicates\none\u2019s virtue (or merit)\u2014what we today euphemistically call\none\u2019s \u201cgood karma\u201d\u2014to all beings, in the hope\nthat one\u2019s own benefits will ripen in them. In this oft-cited\nscriptural passage, the speaker imaginatively maximizes this\nintention, and dedicates all the good karma in the universe, for all\ntime, toward this altruistic purpose. Some, Sapa\u1e47 says,\nmistakenly consider this mass of virtue to be a thing,\nself-established and eternal, and they say that it is equivalent to\nthe \u201cSugata-matrix\u201d, the unelaborated ultimate reality.\nWhat Sapa\u1e47 believes, on the other hand, is that this idea that\nit is possible to dedicate ultimate reality\u2014and that, since one\nonly dedicates wholesome karma, the Dharmadh\u0101tu is a kind of\n\u201cexistent virtue\u201d\u2014is an error that threatens an\nessential dharma teaching.\n\nOn the surface, then, the argument is a tussle over how to read a\npassage from scripture and its apparent, maximal dedication of merit.\nSince the scripture contains the words to recite that enact the\nbodhisattva vow, it is important from a ritual perspective that one\nunderstand the intention behind it. After all, as he argues, the\nmental intention is the true agent for the engagement of a vow. This\nin itself would be enough to make the issue soteriologically\nsignificant. But what merits extensive treatment is that the idea of\n\u201cexistent virtue\u201d violates a consistent norm in\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s writings, which is the strict separation between\nconventional and ultimate reality. We have seen this emphasis in his\napproaches to epistemology and will see it in the doctrine of\nemptiness as well, but here we see the practical, ritual-cum-ethical\napplication of this stance.\n\nSapa\u1e47 begins the argument by quoting a wide range of\nauthoritative sources to show that the \u201cSugata-matrix\u201d is\nunchanging, that it is equivalent to the Dharmadh\u0101tu and the\nTath\u0101gata-nature, and that these are all completely devoid of\nevil and virtue, which are illusory\n constructions.[16]\n Near the end of the passage Sapa\u1e47 recommends that the reader\nstudy, in particular, the Dharmodgata chapter of the Perfection of\nWisdom in 8,000 Lines (I.137; Rhoton 2002: 58). That chapter\nteaches that suchness, Tath\u0101gata and emptiness are all the same,\nwhich is to say they are immobile and unproduced, unrelated to all\nnumbers (including one), unrelated to all concepts whatsoever, and yet\ngreater than\u2014infinitely beyond\u2014anything conceivable. If\nthe Dharmadh\u0101tu thus described does not change, it cannot go from\nbeing undedicated to dedicated; which means that you cannot dedicate\nit. Sapa\u1e47 writes that the Vajradhvaja\nS\u016btra\u2019s expressions \u201cas much as\u201d and\n\u201cexists\u201d (from \u201cas much as exists in the past,\npresent and future\u201d) could not possibly refer to the\nDharmadh\u0101tu: \u201cAs much as\u201d appeals to the rejected\nidea of number, and, as he cites many sources to show, it is false to\nsay of the ultimate that it either \u201cexists\u201d or \u201cdoes\nnot exist\u201d. Based on scripture alone, then, this passage could\nnot imply the dedication of the Dharmadh\u0101tu. The passage is just\nsaying that we dedicate the actions (the karma) of\nall beings\u2014just, whatever virtuous actions beings perform. This\nkeeps the dedication ritual firmly in the realm of conventional,\nchanging, illusory, reality.\n\nSapa\u1e47 cites the possibility that the basis for the idea of\n\u201cexistent virtue\u201d is the Abhidharmasamuccaya of\nAsa\u1e45ga, which does call the Dharmadh\u0101tu\n\u201cvirtue\u201d, distinguishing it from the evils of cyclic\nexistence, and using terms such as \u201cnatural virtue\u201d and\n\u201cabsolute virtue\u201d. Sapa\u1e47 considers this passage\nmerely figurative. It is like calling people whose hunger is sated,\n\u201cdesireless\u201d\u2014when of course they still have other\ndesires. To call the Dharmadh\u0101tu \u201cvirtue\u201d is only to\nrefer to the absence of evil\u2014to emptiness itself. But the\nDharmadh\u0101tu is not itself the cause of well-being, which\nis how virtue was defined. If the Dharmadh\u0101tu caused\nwell-being, all actions would be virtuous, since all things are\ncontained within it. Sapa\u1e47 gives a similarly figurative reading\nto the Uttaratantra\u2019s discussion of an innately\nexistent Buddhahood; it cannot mean this literally, he says,\nsince otherwise it would be affirming a non-Buddhist belief in an\neternal soul.\n\nUltimate reality\u2019s numberless freedom from conceptual\nelaborations is, needless to say, a difficult idea to fathom. After\nall, we could only fathom it by means of concepts. But the notion\nallows Sapa\u1e47 to reject a number of intermediate proposals, such\nas the notion that perhaps the dedicatable Sugata-matrix refers only\nto the animate portion of the Dharmadh\u0101tu. As he\nreplies, there are no distinctions and hence no \u201cportions\u201d\nin the Dharmadh\u0101tu! That\u2019s what it means to say that it is\nfree of elaborations.\n3.4 Considering Wider Ethical Applications\n\nThese considerations bring Sapa\u1e47 to some profound analyses that\nsubtly divide the conceivable, causal reality from the inconceivable,\nand push the reader to contemplate his deeper message. One of these is\nstimulated by an opponent\u2019s proposal that even though\ntechnically you cannot dedicate the Dharmadh\u0101tu, perhaps\nthere is no harm in saying that you dedicate it. This may\nseem like an elegant appeal to the conventionality of conventional\nreality, and the general Buddhist emphasis on the intention or the\naspiration as the source and cause of virtue. Yet it is just here that\nSapa\u1e47 shows his exacting requirement that there be no\n\u201cmixing\u201d of the Great Vehicle and Disciple\u2019s paths:\n\u201cThat dedication is harmful. Because it involves the perception\nof an object, it will become a poisonous dedication\u201d (I.111;\nRhoton 2002: 55). The point is that bodhisattvas have a different\nunderstanding of the dedicatory ritual than Disciples, rooted\nin the bodhisattva\u2019s understanding that there is no real object\nthat can be dedicated. The compassion that motivates the\nbodhisattva\u2019s dedication of merit is a universal, ultimate\ncompassion whose nature is inseparable from emptiness. To imagine that\nthe Dharmadh\u0101tu as an object is a (non-empty) and hence\n\u201cdedicatable\u201d thing is to turn a Great Vehicle concept\ninto an ordinary conceptual construction, and thereby poison the\naltruistic\n intention.[17]\n\n\nPerhaps the most important \u201cpractical\u201d ethical result of\nthis discussion appears in Sapa\u1e47\u2019s clear advocacy of moral\ncontextualism. Different systems of vows require different\nbehaviors\u2014and yet within each system, these behaviors are\nmorally significant and genuinely beneficial or harmful. The fact that\nthere are some eighteen different systems of monastic vows, which\ndiffer among themselves about countless particulars, does not\nundermine the validity of each system on its own terms, and does not\nallow for impromptu mixing and matching. A resonant example\nSapa\u1e47 cites is that whereas some systems consider the killing of\nan unborn fetus an instance of the taking of a human life, other\nsystems do not. But the taking of a human life is one of the principal\ndownfalls (p\u0101r\u0101jika), an irredeemable infraction of\nthe monastic vows that causes immediate expulsion. And presumably, if\nyou have violated your vows in this way, you cannot simply move to\nanother monastery where killing a fetus is not considered having taken\na human life. But more importantly, Sapa\u1e47 explains that the\nvows, though they differ one from the other, are all approved by the\nBuddha as sets that serve the function of monastic vows, which is to\nprevent the vow-holder\u2019s mind from straying into\ninfractions\u2014like a fence around a field. Vows have morally\nconsequential effects upon the mind, and they consist in coherent,\nBuddha-approved systems.\n\nThe final argument from the Three Vows I will mention is in\nthe chapter on Mantra vows, but is clearly connected with the topics\nalready discussed here. One of the issues most important to\nSapa\u1e47\u2014he lists it twice in the final summary lists of\nessential topics mentioned above, and he also treats it in the\nSage\u2019s Intent\u2014is the misuse of\nVajrav\u0101r\u0101h\u012b (Vajra Sow) blessings as a\nsubstitute for Mantric initiation. This, he says, is not taught in any\nof the scriptures. You need a real initiation ritual to practice\nMantra\u2014it\u2019s as simple as that! You cannot substitute a\nblessing for an initiation. He calls the alterations in the dharma\n\u201cthe blessings of demons\u201d\u2014claiming not that his\ncontemporaries are demons, but that they have been deceived.\n\nWhat irks Sapa\u1e47 the most, it would seem, is what he sees as an\nattempt to excuse carelessness by appealing to the fact that rituals\nare only conventional constructions. He concludes the point by saying\nthat all rites belong to conventional reality: Disciples,\nGreat Vehicle, and Mantra rites. If you accept any of the systems, you\nmust accept them in their entirety; you must do all, or\nnone. There is no option to make a distinction between\nessential and non-essential doctrines based on the distinction between\nconventional and ultimate. The ultimate simply does not enter into the\nconsideration of whether a rite or ritual\u2014or, for that matter,\nany karma, any act\u2014is\n appropriate.[18]\n The separate systems have each been handed down through valid\nlineages with their own integrity, valued and delimited\nalways by their conventional utility. The fact that\nthey are not ultimate is not an excuse to experiment or play fast and\nloose with the rituals and their interpretation. Everything that we\ncan do, everything that we can say, is only conventional; but that\nfact does not license the blurring of the lines between the effective,\nwell delineated paths taught by the Buddha that can lead us to\nliberation if we follow them with care.\n4. Preserving the True Path: Clarifying the Sage\u2019s Intent\n\nClarifying the Sage\u2019s Intent (D. Jackson 2015) is a path text, of the\ngenre called Tenrim (bstan rim), \u201cstages of the\ndoctrine\u201d, which lays out in detail the practices and\naccomplishments for beings on the way from ordinary person to\nliberated Buddha. It is an elegant and comprehensive approach to the\npath of the bodhisattva, drawing from Indian sources\u2014especially\nthe Mah\u0101y\u0101nas\u016btr\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra and\nthe Abhidharmasamuccaya of Asa\u1e45ga. Sapa\u1e47 makes\ncreative use of these sources in a variety of ways, and the work is a\ncomplex interplay of tradition and innovation. Yet for our purposes,\nthe most significant aspects of the work are not in his construction\nof the path or his characterizations of bodhisattva practice, but in a\nnumber of philosophical excurses. Unlike the Three Vows, the\nSage\u2019s Intent is not primarily intended as a polemic\ntext; yet occasionally Sapa\u1e47 feels it necessary to address\ncontroversial issues relevant to topics that arise in the course of\nhis descriptions of the bodhisattva path.\n\nAs before, it is not possible to work through all of\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s significant arguments, so I will limit myself to a\ntopic that was among his most extensively debated positions, and which\nis an important theme in this work. The issue is the supposed\n\u201cWhite Self-sufficient Remedy\u201d, often translated\n\u201cWhite Panacea\u201d\u2014a term used to describe the\nmeditation practice called \u201cGreat Seal\u201d or\nMah\u0101mudr\u0101. Sapa\u1e47 believes that this term for\nMah\u0101mudr\u0101 represents a mistaken understanding of the\npractice, which transmutes a legitimate tantric practice into a\nmisleading and pernicious, fallacious\n doctrine.[19]\n\n\nIn order to understand why Sapa\u1e47 finds the Self-sufficient\nRemedy doctrine particularly troubling, it will be useful to notice\nhow quintessentially it brings together so much that Sapa\u1e47\nconsiders wrong with Tibetan Buddhism of his day. Recall that\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s distinctive philosophical view rests upon an\nunstinting categorical distinction between the conventional and\nultimate realities, and we have seen that this has important\nconsequences in his epistemology and his approach to the\ninterpretation of Buddhist ethics and the operation of karma. He often\ncriticizes an apparent knee-jerk decontextualization that others read\nout of the doctrine of emptiness. Sapa\u1e47 reminds us, again and\nagain, that emptiness does not mean that nothing really\nmatters, or that everything goes. The view of emptiness does not wipe\naway the conventional. Ultimate reality not relativize all things\nto it. On the contrary, it requires that actions be deemed\nmeaningful or not, real or not, by virtue of their effectiveness and\nrelevance within specifiable contexts. This is Buddhist\ncontextualism.\n\nThe target of Sapa\u1e47\u2019s attack, then, is the notion that,\nsimply by means of the direct apprehension of the nature of the mind\ncalled Mah\u0101mudr\u0101, one attains all of the accomplishments of\nthe path. This one attainment alone is a cure-all, a\n\u201cself-sufficient remedy\u201d. We can see immediately that this\nclaim for this practice challenges and undermines the importance of\nthe many doctrinal details, practices and contexts of the Buddhist\ntradition, paring it down to a single visionary experience. In\naddition, Sapa\u1e47 considers this view a Tibetan invention, not\nattested in India, that resembles a famously rejected Chinese doctrine\nassociated with the monk Hvashang Mohoyen. The \u201cWhite\nSelf-sufficient Remedy\u201d is, he believes, an ignorant distortion\nof the dharma that leads to a nihilistic decline of the teachings.\nFurthermore, Sapa\u1e47 considers the practice of Mah\u0101mudr\u0101\na tantric, not a general Mah\u0101y\u0101na practice, so he rejects\nthe non-tantric form of the teaching circulating in his day. There is\nreason to believe that this particular \u201cmixing\u201d of general\nGreat Vehicle and specific tantric practices in fact had an Indian\nprecedent, but Sapa\u1e47 seems to have assumed that Indian adepts\nwould have prevented this as a mistake (see Mathes 2008).\n\nFrom a historical perspective, it is important to distinguish the\nconceptual implications of the Self-sufficient Remedy claim from its\nactual use. Not all adherents of the Self-sufficient Remedy view, most\nlikely followers of Gampopa, the founder of the Kagyu school of\nTibetan Buddhism, would have taught a practice that actually\ndispensed with all other rituals and meditations in favor of bare\nMah\u0101mudr\u0101 practice. On the contrary, Gampopa\u2019s famous\nfive-stage practice includes the cultivation of Mah\u0101mudr\u0101 as\nthe fourth stage in a practice that also included: the generation of\nbodhicitta; deity visualization; guru devotion; and\ndedication of merit. Gampopa\u2019s is not an instruction on\nabandoning all other aspects of the path. There were, apparently,\ndifferences of opinion even among the adherents of the Self-sufficient\nRemedy doctrine about whether this meant that Mah\u0101mudr\u0101 on\nits own substituted for all other practices, or Mah\u0101mudr\u0101\nwas in some way ultimately, essentially, equivalent to all other\nattainments, as their culmination or their peak. If the latter were\nthe case, one might engage in many practices but from the ultimate\nperspective only reach attainment through Mah\u0101mudr\u0101. In the\nformer case\u2014the proper target of Sapa\u1e47\u2019s\ncritique\u2014one should only even try to attain\nMah\u0101mudr\u0101. Some of Sapa\u1e47\u2019s contemporaries\nunderstood the Remedy as Self-sufficient even to the point of saying\nthat the practitioner did not need to generate\nbodhicitta or dedicate the merit (D. Jackson 1990: 28).\n\nIn the Three Vows Sapa\u1e47 provides a kind of abstract\ncriticism of the logic of calling a practice\n\u201cself-sufficient\u201d when it is part of a list of five. It is\nperhaps in response to this point that Padma Karpo, a defender of the\nKagyu, called Sapa\u1e47\u2019s argument a \u201cchildish\ncriticism\u201d, depicting it as merely a worry about the meanings of\nwords (D. Jackson 1990: 37). He says that if this is why it is faulty\nto say that Mah\u0101mudr\u0101 is \u201csingularly\nsufficient\u201d, then it is also faulty to speak of the standard\ntantric practice as having the \u201ctwo stages\u201d of creation\nand completion\u2014presumably, because those two stages also require\npreparatory bodhicitta generation and subsequent dedication.\nThis does seem to take down at least one, abstract and logical,\nreading of Sapa\u1e47\u2019s argument. It portends to give credence\nto the (rather overblown) claim among Sapa\u1e47\u2019s later\ncritics that he has read the Self-sufficient Remedy doctrine in bad\nfaith.\n\nBut Sapa\u1e47\u2019s critique is not merely a matter of overly\nliteral numeric quibbles in the application of metaphors. In the\nThree Vows it is primarily a critique of the claim that a\nsingle practice can be causally effective, when in fact all\nattainments depend upon multiple causes. In the Sage\u2019s\nIntent Sapa\u1e47 is expansive and detailed in his rejection of\nmany, specific errors. He criticizes the practice\u2019s\nadherents\u2019 notion of resting in the mind as \u201coriginal,\nunaltered and relaxed\u201d (D. Jackson 2015: 492ff). If the mind\nwere simply enlightened in its \u201cunaltered\u201d state, he\nwrites, then the Buddha would never have needed to teach the dharma.\nSuch an ideal, he says, is similar to the non-Mah\u0101y\u0101na\ntraditions of Disciples and Solitary Buddhas, or even simple\nignorance. It cannot be a Mah\u0101y\u0101na path, he writes, if it\nfails to generate compassion and wisdom. He points out that study is\nnecessary to understand the proper target of a meditation on\nemptiness. If the Mah\u0101mudr\u0101 is attempted without prior\ncultivation of merit and wisdom, he says, there is no way that simply\nsaying \u201cI will meditatively cultivate\nnon-conceptualization\u201d could be effective.\n\nThe point that links these various concerns is the overarching worry\nabout moral nihilism, which arises from the claim that all practices\ncan be reduced to one, combined with the unbridled confidence in\ncreative, doctrinal innovation. This allows the practitioner to forego\nthe long and difficult moral training of the bodhisattva in favor of\nan easy, but delusory, instantaneous quasi-attainment. For fear of\nprolixity, I will leave off from Sapa\u1e47\u2019s argument, in\nwhich he employs his distinctive approach to the doctrine of emptiness\nand the two truths. Indeed, although Sapa\u1e47 did not write any\nworks dedicated to the doctrine of emptiness, his view\u2014that, in\nbrief, ultimate truth is beyond all conceptual elaboration\u2014is an\nimportant contribution that deserves further study. Suffice it to say\nthat his view is tailor made to prevent both the conceptual\nreification of emptiness that he criticizes in the Treasury\nand the nihilism that he criticizes in the Sage\u2019s\nIntent.\n\nPerhaps the most controversial aspect of Sapa\u1e47\u2019s critique\nin the Sage\u2019s Intent was his assimilation of the\nnon-tantric Mah\u0101mudr\u0101 view to the doctrine of the famous\nChinese monk called Hvashang Mohoyen. Sapa\u1e47 reiterates the story\ntold in the Testament of Ba (discovered among the textual\ntreasures at Dunhuang) that tells of how, during the imperial period,\nthe Chinese monk debated with, and was bested by, the Indian monk\nKamala\u015b\u012bla. Mohoyen did not claim his view to be a\n\u201cSelf-sufficient Remedy\u201d, but he did believe in an easy\npractice free of cognition that could, on its own, instantaneously\nproduce attainments. Sapa\u1e47 has been criticized for being biased\nand historically uninformed, but modern scholarship has uncovered\nevidence of Chinese \u201cZen\u201d sources for Tibetan views like\nthose he critiqued (D. Jackson 1990, D. Jackson 1994, Kapstein 2000:\n75\u201378 and van Schaik 2015: 175\u2013182).\n5. A Buddhist Approach to Scholarship: The Gateway to Learning\n\nIn the sections above, we have seen Sapa\u1e47 criticize his\ncontemporaries for their mistaken views and practices, which he\nbelieved threatened the integrity and the effectiveness of the\nBuddha\u2019s teachings. As a result of these writings, he was\nvalorized as a great scholar with deep mastery of Buddhist doctrine,\nbut he was also often criticized and sometimes lampooned for being\nstodgy, conservative, and self-satisfied. He certainly believed that\nhe had a clearer and more accurate view of the truth of the doctrine\nthan most Tibetans of his time. Yet he believed the reason he was\nsuperior was easy to explain: He had studied and internalized the vast\nintellectual traditions of India, the land of Buddhism\u2019s source.\nHis learning provided him the means and the justification for\ndefending the dharma against other teachers whose understanding was,\nby comparison, spotty. \n\nIn the Gateway to Learning (D. Jackson 1987 and Gold 2007),\nSapa\u1e47 made his case for the importance of scholastic learning\nfor Tibetans, and provided a clear program of study so that anyone\nwith sufficient diligence could attain the expertise necessary to be a\ndefender of the dharma like himself.  The work is a rare example of a\nmedieval treatise on the goals and means of education, and it is\narticulated with philosophical precision from a Buddhist perspective\nand with a remarkable awareness of the social- and\nhistorical-locatedness of Tibet of Sapa\u1e47\u2019s\ntime. The Gateway is divided into three chapters, each\ndedicated to a category of scholarly learning: composition,\nexposition, and debate. Over the course of these chapters, Sapa\u1e47\nprovides introductory sketches of and occasional excurses into the\ntopics that, in his view, make up the model of Indian\npa\u1e47\u1e0dityam and the most important practices of\nscholarship. The work draws upon the Vy\u0101khy\u0101yukti\nof Vasubandhu in the first two chapters and the\nV\u0101dany\u0101ya of Dharmak\u012brti in the debate\nchapter, and roughly follows an outline from the\nMah\u0101y\u0101nas\u016btr\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra, but it\nis unique in its scope, its Buddhist philosophical bent, and its\nselection of topics precisely targeted to the needs of Tibetans.\n\nAmong the most original and significant analyses here is\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s approach to translation and translation theory. A\nkey theme of Tibetan Buddhist self-understanding has always been a\nkeen sense of Tibet\u2019s proximity to India as the source of the\ndharma, but also its cultural and linguistic distance from India. This\nis a reason that the great translators (and of course,\npa\u1e47\u1e0ditas) were venerated as a bridge to the\noriginal source of the dharma in Sanskrit. Sakya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita\nwas himself a translator and he was very much aware of various kinds\nof shifts and transitions that took place when the dharma moved from\nSanskrit into Tibetan language. In the Gateway he explains\nthe choices made by the translators in a way that reveals just how\ndeep a Tibetan interpreter\u2019s knowledge needs to be in order not\nto be fooled by the translations. It is, in this way, an early\napplication of the cultural studies approach to translation studies\n(see Bassnett & Lefevere 1999). In his analysis, the translations\nare shown to embody the cultural distance between India and Tibet,\nbetween the true dharma and its likely misinterpretation, which can\nonly be overcome by very precise linguistic expertise.\n\nOne example Sapa\u1e47 notes is the use of the Tibetan translation\nye shes to distinguish the Sanskrit original\nj\u00f1\u0101na from praj\u00f1\u0101. There is\nnothing in the source term to reflect the ye, which means,\nfor Sapan, that it is a mistake to think of ye shes as\n\u201cprimordial wisdom\u201d\u2014a common reading in certain\nTibetan schools. The dharma as translated is, in this way, a minefield\nof interpretive problems. It is very easy to make mistakes that can\nlead to false teachings. But it would be wrong to think that this\nlinguistic and cultural distance makes for an essential distinction\nbetween the dharma as it originated in its unadulterated form from the\nmouth of a Buddha, and the dharma as received by Tibetans. Such an\nessentialization would be to reify linguistic entities in a way that\nis non-Buddhist. The key to translation is not to uncover some\nessential nature of meanings embedded in the words. Sapa\u1e47\ntherefore provides a Buddhist philosophical defense of the possibility\nof translation.\n\nSapa\u1e47 draws upon the epistemology of Dharmakirti discussed\nabove, and says that there is no essential relation between words and\nmeanings. Rather, meaning in language depends upon nothing but the\nspeaker\u2019s intention, which is always context-dependent. In the\ncase of the dharma, that means the teacher\u2019s intention to move a\nparticular set of beings forward on the path toward liberation. The\nkey in transmitting the teachings from generation to generation is to\npreserve, as well as possible, the capacity of the teachings to have\nthat effect. And the only way to do that is to preserve an\nunderstanding of the speaker\u2019s specific intentions in\nusing language as expressed in the particular texts we have. Teachers\nhave to know just what the meaning was meant to be, when these words\nwere uttered. So, a detailed understanding of the language of the\ndharma\u2014the contexts of its origination in the forms that we have\nit\u2014is inseparable from the larger project of the sangha, to\ncommunicate the teachings from generation to generation. The\ntranslations, because they are vulnerable to misinterpretation,\nrequire special handling and expertise. Sapa\u1e47 says we need a\ncommunity of experts to protect the teachings and preserve their\nproper interpretation. We need an interpretive community that can act\nas a bulwark against the decline of the dharma. Every aspect of the\nscholar\u2019s toolbox\u2014from elementary Sanskrit language study\nto literary theory to the regulation of debate methods\u2014is\nprovided with an explanation and justification of the norms of this\nidealized Buddhist guard.\n\nIn the section on debate, Sapa\u1e47 again explained a number of\npoints of particular interest to Tibetans of his time. Of great\ninterest here is his discussion of debate based on scripture, in which\nhe explains strategies for showing contradictions in the\nVedas while defending against critics who claim that the\nBuddhist scriptures are inconsistent. These instructions cohere with\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s stated understanding that debate proper is a\ncompetition between adherents of different tenets. Of course, students\nmay practice debate to test their understanding of treatises, but the\nreal reason to engage in debate is to defend the dharma. Here we see\ndebate as a skill that is properly the culmination of the previous\ntrainings from Sanskrit language to poetics, all of which have as\ntheir ultimate aim to defend the Buddha\u2019s dharma against its\nenemies, whether they be indirectly or unintentionally damaging it\nthrough misreadings and misrepresentations, or attacking it openly in\nthe promotion of non-Buddhist doctrines. Sapa\u1e47 envisions\nTibetans training for a translocal courtly stage, where traditions\nlived or died by royal decree. Perhaps his own fame and skill as a\ndefender of the dharma contributed to Sakya\u2019s attaining control\nover a united Tibet under Mongol rule.\n",
