    "main_text": "From Logical Constructions to Measurement Theory\n11. Successors to Logical Construction\n\nIn the 1930s Susan Stebbing and John Wisdom, founding what has come to\nbe called the \u201cCambridge School of Analysis,\u201d paid\nconsiderable attention to the notion of logical construction (see\nBeaney 2003). Stebbing (1933) was concerned with the unclarity over\nwhether it was expressions or entities that are logical constructions,\nand with how to understand a claim such as \u201cthis table is a\nlogical construction\u201d and indeed what it could even mean to\ncontrast logical constructions with inferred entities. \n(See the entry on Susan Stebbing.)\nRussell had been motivated by the logicist project of finding\ndefinitions and elementary premises from which mathematical statements\ncould be proved. Stebbing and Wisdom were concerned, rather, with\nrelating the notion of construction to philosophical analysis of\nordinary language.  Wisdom\u2019s (1931) series of papers\nin Mind interpreted logical constructions in terms of ideas\nfrom Wittgenstein\u2019s\nTractatus (1921).\n\nDemopoulos and Friedman (1985) find an anticipation of the recent\n\u201cstructural realist\u201d view of scientific theories in\n(Russell 1927), The Analysis of Matter. They argue that the\nlogical constructions of sense data in Russell\u2019s earlier\nthinking on the \u201cproblem of matter\u201d were replaced by\ninferences to the structural properties of space and matter from\npatterns of sense data. We may sense patches of color next to each\nother in our visual field, but what that tells us about the causes of\nthose sense data, about matter, is only revealed by the structure of\nthose relationships. Thus the color of a patch in our visual field\ntells us nothing about the intrinsic properties of the table that\ncauses that experience. Instead it is the structural properties of our\nexperiences, such as their relative order in time, and which are\nbetween which others in the visual field, that gives us a clue as to\nthe structural relationships of time and space within the material\nworld that causes the experience. The contemporary version of this\naccount, called \u201cstructural realism\u201d, holds that it is\nonly the structural properties and relations that a scientific theory\nattributes to the world about which we should be scientific realists.\n(See the entry on\n structural realism.)\n\nAccording to this account, Russell\u2019s initial project of\nreplacing inference with logical construction was to find for each\npattern of sense data some logical construction that bears a pattern\nof isomorphic structural relations. That project was transformed,\nDemopoulos and Friedman argue, by replacing inference from the given\nin experience to the cause of that experience with an inference to the\nrather impoverished, structural, reality of the causes of those\nexperiences. Russell\u2019s matter project was interpreted in this\nway by others, and led, in 1928, to G.H. Newman\u2019s apparently\ndevastating objection. Newman (1928) pointed out that there is always\na structure of arbitrarily \u201cconstructed\u201d relations with\nany given structure if only the number of basic entities, in this case\nsense data, is large enough. According to Demopoulos and Friedman,\nNewman shows that there must be more to scientific theories than\ntrivial statements to the effect that matter has some structural\nproperties isomorphic to those of our sense data. The project of\nThe Analysis of Matter does indeed face a serious difficulty\nwith \u201cNewman\u2019s problem\u201d, whether or not those\ndifficulties arise for the earlier project of logical construction\n(see Linsky 2013).\n\nThe notion of logical construction had a great impact on the future\ncourse of analytic philosophy. One line of influence was via the\nnotion of a contextual definition, or paraphrase, intended to minimize\nontological commitment and to be a model of philosophical analysis.\nThe distinction between the surface appearance of definite\ndescriptions, as singular terms, and the fully interpreted sentences\nfrom which they seem to disappear was seen as a model for making\nproblematic notions disappear upon analysis. Wisdom (1931) proposed\nthis application of logical construction in the spirit of\nWittgenstein. In this way the theory of descriptions has been viewed\nas a paradigm of philosophical analysis of this\n\u201ctherapeutic\u201d sort that seeks to dissolve logical\nproblems.\n\nA more technical strand in analytic philosophy was influenced by the\nconstruction of matter. Rudolf Carnap quotes (Russell 1914a, 11) as\nthe motto for his \u201cAufbau\u201d, the Logical\nStructure of the World (1967):\n\n\nThe supreme maxim in scientific philosophizing is this: Whenever\npossible, logical constructions are to be substituted for inferred\nentities. (Carnap 1967, 6)\n\n\nIn the Aufbau the construction of matter from\n\u201celementary experiences\u201d, and later Nelson Goodman (1951)\ncontinued the project. Michael Friedman (1999) and Alan Richardson\n(1998) have argued that Carnap\u2019s project of construction owed\nmuch more to his background in neo-Kantian issues about the\n\u201cconstitution\u201d of empirical objects than with\nRussell\u2019s project. See, however, Pincock (2002) for a response\nthat argues for the importance of Russell\u2019s project of\nreconstructing scientific knowledge in (Carnap 1967). More generally,\nthe use of set theoretic constructions became widespread among\nphilosophers, and continues in the construction of set theoretic\nmodels, both in the sense of logic where they model formal theories\nand to provide descriptions of truth conditions for sentences about\nentities.\n\nThe most faithful successor to Russell\u2019s notion of logical\nconstruction is to be found in Willard van Orman Quine\u2019s\n\u201cexplication\u201d. Quine presents his methodology in Word\nand Object (1960) beginning with an allusion to Ramsey\u2019s\nremark in the title of section 53: \u201cThe Ordered Pair as\nPhilosophical Paradigm\u201d. The difficulties with apparently\nreferring expressions that motivated Russell\u2019s theory of\ndescriptions are presented as a more general problem:\n\n\nA pattern repeatedly illustrated in recent sections is that of the\ndefective noun that proves undeserving of objects and is dismissed as\nan irreferential fragment of a few containing phrases. But sometimes\nthe defective noun fares oppositely: its utility is found to turn on\nthe admission of denoted objects as values of the variables of\nquantification. In such a case our job is to devise interpretations\nfor it in the term positions where, in its defectiveness, it had not\nused to occur. (Quine 1960, 257)\n\n\nThe notion of a \u201cdefective noun\u201d that is to be\n\u201cdismissed as an irreferential fragment\u201d clearly echoes\nthe description of constructions as logical fictions and their\nexpressions as mere incomplete symbols that so aptly describe the\ncontextual definitions for definite descriptions and classes. The task\nof \u201cdevising interpretations\u201d is more like the positive\naspect suggested by the term \u201cconstruction\u201d and\nillustrated in the cases of the construction of numbers and matter.\nAfter concluding that the expression \u201cordered pair\u201d was\nsuch a \u201cdefective noun\u201d, Quine says that the notion of an\nordered pair \\(\\langle x,y \\rangle\\) of two entities \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\ndoes have \u201cutility\u201d and is limited only in having to\nfulfill one \u201cpostulate\u201d:\n\n(1)\nIf \\(\\langle x,y \\rangle = \\langle z,w \\rangle\\) then \\(x = z\\)\nand \\(y = w\\).\n\n\nIn other words, that ordered pairs are distinguished by having unique\nfirst and second elements. Quine then continues:\n\n\nThe problem of suitably eking out the use of these defective nouns can\nbe solved once for all by systematically fixing upon some suitable\nalready-recognized object, for each \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), with which to\nidentify \\(\\langle x,y \\rangle\\). The problem is a neat one, for we\nhave in (1) a single explicit standard by which to judge whether a\nversion is suitable. (Quine 1960, 258)\n\n\nAgain Quine echoes Russell\u2019s language with his mention of a\n\u201cneat\u201d property that calls out for a\n\u201cconstruction\u201d from known entities. Quine distinguishes\nhis project, which he calls \u201cexplication\u201d, by the fact\nthat there are alternative possible ways to fix the notion. Although\nWhitehead and Russell give an account in PM \u221755, where they are\ncalled \u201cordinal couples\u201d, the first proposal to treat\nordered pairs as classes of their members is from Norbert Wiener\n(1914a) who identifies \\(\\langle x,y \\rangle\\) with \\(\\{\\{ x \\}, \\{ y,\n\\Lambda \\}\\}\\), where \\(\\Lambda\\) is the empty class. From this\ndefinition it is easy to recover the first and second elements of the\npair, and so Quine\u2019s (1) is an elementary theorem. Later,\nKazimierz Kuratowski proposed the definition \\(\\{\\{ x \\}, \\{x,y\\}\\}\\),\nfrom which (1) also follows. For Quine it is a matter of choice which\ndefinition to use, as the points on which they differ are\n\u201cdon\u2019t-cares\u201d (1960, 182), issues which give a\nprecise answer to questions about which our pre-theoretic account is\nmute. An explication thus differs considerably from an\n\u201canalysis\u201d of ordinary, or pre-theoretic language, both in\ngiving a precise meaning to the expression where it might have been\nobscure, or perhaps simply silent and in possibly differing from\npre-theoretic use, as suggested by the name. This fits well with the\nasymmetries we have noted between analysis and construction, with\nanalysis aimed at the discovery of the constituents and structure of\npropositions which are given to us, and construction which is more a\nmatter of choice, with the goal being the recovery of particular\n\u201cneat\u201d features of the construction in a formal theory.\nThe ordered pair is thus a \u201cphilosophical paradigm\u201d for\nQuine just as Russell\u2019s theory of descriptions was a paradigm of\nphilosophy for Ramsey, and each is a \u201clogical\nconstruction\u201d.\n",
