    "main_text": "Why Is Discrimination Wrong? || The Wrongs of Indirect Discrimination\n4.2 The Wrongs of Indirect Discrimination\n\n\nThe most egregious forms of indirect discrimination are typically\nstructural, due to the pervasive impact of a society\u2019s basic\ninstitutions on the life-prospects of its members (Rawls 1971:\n7). Indirect discrimination is structural when the rules and norms\nof society consistently produce disproportionately disadvantageous\noutcomes for the members of a certain group, relative to the other groups\nin society, the outcomes are unjust to the members of the disadvantaged\ngroup, and the production of the outcomes is to be explained by the\ngroup membership of those individuals. Cass Sunstein nicely captures the\nwrong of this form of indirect discrimination in the course of\nexplaining his antidiscrimination principle, which he calls the\n\u201canticaste principle.\u201d He writes, \u201cThe\nmotivating idea [for the anticaste principle] is that without good\nreason, social and legal structures should not turn differences that\nare both highly visible and irrelevant from the moral point of view\ninto systematic social disadvantages. A systematic disadvantage is one\nthat operates along standard and predictable lines in multiple and\nimportant spheres of life\u201d (1994: 2429). In a similar vein,\nCatharine MacKinnon finds structural discrimination against women to be\nintolerable because it consists of \u201cthe systematic\nrelegation of an entire group of people to a condition of\ninferiority\u201d (1987: 41).\n\n\nTwo related wrongs belonging to structural discrimination can be\ndistinguished. First is the wrong that consists of society\u2019s major\ninstitutions imposing, without adequate justification, relative\ndisadvantages on persons belonging to certain salient social\ngroups. Accordingly, it is wrong for society\u2019s basic rules to deny to\nwomen or to racial or religious minorities opportunities for personal\nfreedom, development, and flourishing equal to those that men or\nracial and religious majorities enjoy. Second is the wrong of placing\nthe members of a salient social group in a position of vulnerability\nto exploitation and domination as a result of the denial of equal\nopportunities and the imposition of other kinds of relative\ndisadvantage. Accordingly, it is wrong for a society to make women\nvulnerable to sexual exploitation and domination at the hands of men\nby the imposition of various economic and social disadvantages\nrelative to men.\n\n\nIn contrast, the wrongs of non-structural forms of indirect\ndiscrimination seem to be dependent on structural (or direct)\ndiscrimination. Consider the Griggs case. The\ncompany\u2019s promotion policy was not part of the wrong involved in\nsociety\u2019s basic institutions imposing relative disadvantages on\nblacks. But the policy did have some connection to structural\nracial discrimination and to the widespread direct discrimination\nagainst blacks that existed prior to and contemporaneous with the\npolicy. The policy helped to perpetuate the unjust disadvantages\nthat were due to such structural and direct discrimination, even though\nthe policy was not needed to serve any legitimate business purpose, and\nthat was why the policy was wrong. Or at least that is what the\nproponents of the idea of indirect discrimination appear to have in\nmind when they talk about non-structural forms of indirect\ndiscrimination.\n\n\nAre the wrongs of indirect discrimination sufficiently similar to the\nwrongs of direct discrimination that it is reasonable to say that they\nare, in fact, two different types of one and the same wrong? We have\nseen that the accounts of the wrong of direct discrimination are many\nand various. But abstracting from those differences, critics of the\nidea of indirect discrimination might argue that discrimination is\nessentially a process-based wrong, rather than an outcome-based one,\nand that only direct discrimination is process-based. In other words,\nonly with direct discrimination is there a defect in how some outcome\nis brought about, rather than in what the outcome itself is. On this\nview, discriminating against people is similar to having someone who\nhas been bribed serve as a judge in an ice-skating competition: just\nas the biased judging taints the process by which places are awarded\nin the competition, discrimination taints the process by which\nopportunities and other social goods get distributed among the members\nof society.\n\n\nHowever, one can understand indirect discrimination as involving\nprocess-based wrongs, although the wrongs do not necessarily occur at\nthe retail level of the practical reasoning of specific agents.\nConsider the structural form of indirect discrimination.\nDisproportionately disadvantageous outcomes do not, by\nthemselves, amount to structural discrimination, even when those\noutcomes fall on the shoulders of the members of a salient social group\nsuch as women or racial or religious minorities. There must also\nbe a linkage between membership in the group and the disadvantageous\noutcomes: group membership must help explain why the disproportionately\ndisadvantageous outcomes fall where they do. This explanation\nwill proceed at the wholesale level of macro-social facts about the\npopulation and the various groups that constitute it. But the\nrequirement of a linkage shows that how the disproportionate outcomes\nare brought about is essential to the existence of structural\ndiscrimination. There must be social processes at work that, as\nSunstein puts its, \u201cturn differences that are both highly visible\nand irrelevant from the moral point of view into systematic social\ndisadvantages\u201d (1994: 2429). It is true that the\ndifferences do not need to be literally visible; they need only be\nsocially salient. But the main point is that there is something\nmorally wrong with social processes that consistently but avoidably\nturn such differences into relative disadvantages for the members of\nsalient groups, such as women or racial or religious groups. A\nparallel is thereby established with direct discrimination, in which\nthere is something morally wrong with a practical-reasoning process\nthat treats sex, race, or religion as grounds for treating persons as\nhaving a degraded or diminished moral status.\n\n\nWith the non-structural form of indirect discrimination, the parallel\nto the wrong of direct discrimination is even stronger, because the\nmorally flawed process does occur at the retail\nlevel. In Griggs, the company\u2019s decision to use certain\nexams to determine promotions contributed to the unjust disadvantages\nsuffered by blacks from structural and direct discrimination.  Yet,\nthe use of the exams was apparently not necessary to determine who\ncould best perform the jobs in question or to meet any other\nlegitimate purpose of the business. It is plausible to say, then, that\nthe company\u2019s decision process wrongly counted for nothing the\npromotion policy\u2019s contribution to the perpetuation and even\nexacerbation of unjust disadvantages from which blacks already\nsuffered. This process-based wrong is at the level of a specific\nagent, albeit a collective agent. The difference with direct\ndiscrimination is that it is a moral failure of omission, i.e.,\nfailing to take appropriate account of the impact of the promotion\npolicy on blacks, rather than a failure of commission, such as\ndeliberately excluding blacks from better-paying positions. In either\ncase, though, an agent has engaged in a morally flawed process of\npractical reasoning in which the flaw concerns the role that\nconsiderations of salient group membership play. \n\n\nThere is a case to be made, then, that the wrongs of indirect\ndiscrimination, structural and non-structural, are importantly\nparallel to those of direct discrimination. The case will look less\nconvincing to Eidelson (2015: 28\u201330) and others who think of\n(moralized) discrimination as fundamentally a retail-level wrong with\nno necessary connection to socially-salient groups.  For those\nthinkers, it might be an injustice if the basic structure of a society\noperates so that certain socially-salient groups lack equality of\nopportunity, but the injustice is not necessarily a matter of\ndiscrimination.  Yet, for thinkers who would contend that the value of\nthe idea of discrimination derives from the fact that it can pick out\nsystemic wrongs linked in a certain way to socially-salient groups,\nthen direct and indirect discrimination represent distinct but\nparallel versions of the same type of wrong, and the term\n\u2018indirect discrimination\u2019 is not simply \u201ca piece of\nlegal jargon\u201d (Eidelson 2015: 19) but a valuable term in our\nmoral lexicon. \n",
