    "main_text": "\n\nWilliam Edward Burghardt Du Bois (1868\u20131963) believed that his\nlife acquired its only deep significance through its participation in\nwhat he called \u201cthe Negro problem,\u201d or, later, \u201cthe\nrace problem.\u201d Whether that is true or not, it is difficult to\nthink of anyone, at any time, who examined the race problem in its\nmany aspects more profoundly, extensively, and subtly than W.E.B. Du\nBois. Du Bois was an activist and a journalist, a historian and a\nsociologist, a novelist, a critic, and a philosopher\u2014but it is\nthe race problem that unifies his work in these many domains.\n\nDu Bois contributes to our specifically philosophical understanding of\nrace and the race problem, because he treats these themes as objects\nof philosophical consideration\u2014indeed, it is largely through an\nengagement with Du Bois\u2019s work that many contemporary\nphilosophers have come to appreciate race and race-related concerns as\nfruitful topics of philosophical reflection. Through his work in\nsocial philosophy, political philosophy, and the philosophy of art, Du\nBois, for all intents and purposes, invented the field of philosophy\nand race, thereby unsettling and revising our views of the proper\nscope and aims of philosophical inquiry.\n",
