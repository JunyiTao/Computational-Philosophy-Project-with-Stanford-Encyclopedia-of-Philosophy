The status of explanatory theories was\ninterpreted either in an instrumentalist or realist way: Plato\u2019s\nschool started the tradition of \u201csaving the appearances\u201d\nin astronomy, while Aristotle took theories to be necessary truths.\nBoth parties can take explanatory power to be a criterion of\na good theory, as shown by van Fraassen\u2019s (1980) constructive\nempiricism and Wilfrid Sellars\u2019 scientific realism (Pitt 1981;\nTuomela 1985). When it is added that a good theory should also yield\ntrue empirical predictions, the notions of explanatory and predictive\npower can be combined within the notion of systematic power\n(Hempel 1965). If the demand of systematic power simply means that a\ntheory has many true deductive consequences in the observational\nlanguage, this concept is essentially equivalent to the notion of\nempirical success and empirical problem-solving ability discussed in\nSection 3.2, but normally explanation is taken to include additional\nstructural conditions besides mere deduction (Aliseda 2006). Inductive\nsystematization should also be taken into account (Hempel 1965;\nNiiniluoto and Tuomela 1973).\n\nOne important idea regarding systematization is that a good theory\nshould unify empirical data and laws from different domains\n(Kitcher 1993; Schurz 2015). For Whewell, the paradigm case of such\n\u201cconsilience\u201d was the successful unification of\nKepler\u2019s laws and Galileo\u2019s laws by means of\nNewton\u2019s theory. On the other hand, instead of requiring\nconsensus on a single unifying theory, many philosophers have defended\npluralist approaches by arguing that scientific progress needs a\nvariety of conceptual classifications (Dupr\u00e9 1993; Kitcher\n2001), a non-fundamentalist patchwork of laws for \u201ca dappled\nworld\u201d (Cartwright 1999), and different perspectives and values\n(Longino 2002).\n\n\nIf theories are underdetermined by observational data, then one is\noften advised to choose the simplest theory compatible with the\nevidence (Foster and Martin 1966). Simplicity may be an\naesthetic criterion of theory choice (Kuipers 2019), but it may also\nhave a cognitive function in helping us in our attempt to understand\nthe world in an \u201ceconomical\u201d way. Ernst Mach\u2019s\nnotion of the economy of thought is related to the demand of\nmanageability, which is important especially in the\nengineering sciences and other applied sciences: for example, a\nmathematical equation can be made \u201csimpler\u201d by suitable\napproximations, so that it can be solved by a computer. Simplicity has\nalso been related to the notion of systematic or unifying power. This\nis clear in Eino Kaila\u2019s concept of relative\nsimplicity, which he defined in 1939 as the ratio between the\nexplanatory power and the structural complexity of a theory (for a\ntranslation, see Kaila 2014). According to this conception, progress\ncan be achieved by finding structurally simpler explanations of the\nsame data, or by increasing the scope of explanations without making\nthem more complex. Laudan\u2019s formula of solved empirical problems\nminus generated conceptual problems is a variation of the same\nidea.\n\nAfter Hempel\u2019s pioneering work in 1948, various probabilistic\nmeasures of explanatory power have been proposed (Hempel 1965;\nHintikka 1968). Most of them demand that the explanatory theory \\(h\\)\nshould be positively relevant to the empirical data \\(e\\). This is the\ncase also with the particular proposal \n\n\\[\n\\frac{P(h\\mid e) - P(h\\mid\\neg e)}{P(h\\mid e) + P(h\\mid\\neg e)}\n\\]\n\n defended by\nSchupbach and Sprenger (2011) as the unique measure which satisfies\nseven intuitively plausible adequacy conditions.\n",
