Genomic, proteomic and\ntranscriptomic studies are producing vast amounts of immune data with\nlittle understanding of the basic organization and regulation that\nmust integrate systems-level and molecular-level approaches (Ohno\n1990; Schatz and Langmead 2013; see the entry on\n genomics and postgenomics).\n\nThe shift from a focus on the insularity and autonomy of the organism\nto its integration within a complex consortium of species carries a\ncontrasting holistic orientation to the reductivism characterizing the\nmolecularization of immunology (Ulvestad 2007: 65\u201367). The\ntheoretical implications and practical methodological re-direction\nindicate a re-alignment of research strategies for immunology and,\nmore generally, an important contribution to the larger debates\nconcerning the character and feasibility of non-reductionist research\nprograms in the life sciences (Kitcher 1984; Sarkar 1998; Wimsatt\n2007). Initially focused on the question of the relationship between\nclassical genetics and molecular biology, these debates have turned to\nexplanatory strategies in distinct biological subdisciplines, such as\nneuroscience (Craver 2005), ecology (Dupr\u00e9 1993), systems\nbiology (Wolkenhauer and Green 2013) and developmental biology (Love\n2008; see the entry on\n developmental biology).\n Still awaiting broader recognition as an exemplar of explanatory\npractices in life sciences, immunology already serves as a case study\nto approach the problem of reduction and holism in biology and\nmedicine.\n\nDifferent models of epistemic reduction have been considered with\nlittle consensus about the applicability of this type of explanation\n(Sarkar 1998). Dissatisfaction with models of theory reduction led to\nvarious models of explanatory reduction that, unlike\ndeductive-nomological accounts, consider relationships between\nepistemic units other than theories containing laws, while relying on\nan intuitive sense of reduction as an explanation of higher level\nfeatures in terms of their parts (see the entry on\n reductionism in biology).\n A dominant concern about reduction is the so called\n\u201cmany-many\u201d relationships between levels of analysis,\nwhere biological features are context dependent and may vary due to\nheterogeneous lower level features (Hull 1974; Fodor 1974; S. Gilbert\nand Sarkar 2000). One approach maintains that non-reductionist\nexplanations should focus on gross \u201ccytological\u201d features\nof the studied phenomena rather than on lower level molecular\nprocesses (Kitcher 1984). In contrast to this approach, immunologists\nassume that reduction is an attempt to explain complex immune\nphenomena in terms of isolated parts and interactions without\ntaking into consideration the entirety of structural and functional\ncomplexities (Van Regenmortel 2002). Thus, instead of assuming that\nnon-reductionist explanations must ignore lower level molecular\ndetails, holistic immunologists attempt to understand the multilevel\ncomplexity of the immune phenomena they study (Rivas et al. 2017).\nAccordingly, non-reductionist descriptions do not attempt to remain on\na descriptive, biological level of understanding, but rather adapt\npluralistic approaches that integrate distinct dimensions and frames\nof reference, i.e., both molecular and higher orders of analysis. This\nperspective aligns with recent approaches in philosophy of biology\nthat move beyond the division of lower- and higher-level explanatory\nstrategies and highlight the importance of interdisciplinary\nintegration exhibited by current scientific practice (Brigandt 2010;\nLove and Lugar 2013).\n\nBoth reductive and holistic immunological research agendas have vied\nfor dominance (Silverstein 2009: 25\u201342). The immune-chemical\nprogram, championed by Ehrlich and other immunochemists of the first\nhalf of the twentieth century, examined immune reactions in terms of\nchemical and physical forces between immune receptors and their\nligands (Silverstein 2009: 456). These immunochemists were adopting a\n\u201cunifactoralism\u201d strategy that endeavors to explain\ncomplex biological processes in terms of single factors (Powell and\nDupr\u00e9 2008). That program was modified and renewed by the\nelucidation of the genetics of antibody diversification, a series of\ndiscoveries that placed immunology well within the molecular biology\nrevolution (Podolsky and Tauber 1997).\n\nStudies of immunity coupled to developmental biology, ecology, and\nevolutionary biology have balanced the molecularization of immunology\nwith an organism-based orientation. Early advocates of such\napproaches, like Metchnikoff, described immunity in terms of cells and\ncellular interactions, a \u201cbiological\u201d perspective extended\nby Burnet, who eclectically endeavored to include underlying molecular\nprocesses (Crist and Tauber 2000; Baxter 2006: 38). He presented\nimmunity in terms of adaptation, selection, and population-level cell\nbehavior, rather than solely in terms of chemical and physical\nmolecular reactions. As already discussed, this broadened perspective\nintroduced the \u2018self\u2019 into the immune lexicon and brought\nnew figurative language associated with agency and a host of meanings\nborrowed from other human experience. And, complementing these\nholistic explanatory and narrative strategies, he also postulated the\nexistence of molecular signatures of self and considered lymphocyte\nreceptors as independent decision-makers mediating immune reactions\nbased on their physical fit with cognate antigens (Burnet 1969). Thus,\nby representing cases of theoretical integration and explanatory\nheterogeneity, epistemic strategies adopted by Burnet and other\norganism-oriented immunologists fit into the inclusion of of plurality\nand unification increasingly regarded as necessary to capture the\ncomplexity of immune functions (cf. Dupr\u00e9 1993; Mitchell 2003;\nPlutynski 2013).\n\nMore recently, attempts to integrate molecular biology with systems\nanalysis challenge the apparent conflict between reductionist and\nholist strategies (Green et al. 2017; Mazzocchi 2012). After all,\nattempts to explain complex immunological phenomena in terms of\nisolated parts and interactions without taking into consideration the\nentirety of structural and functional complexity that these phenomena\nexhibit have been ineffective. For example, vaccine development\nstudies, when limited to investigation of the structural correlates of\nantigen-antibody interaction without deeper understanding of the\ndynamic features of a host-pathogen encounter, often prove\nunsuccessful (Van Regenmortel 2002). So, instead of assuming that\nnon-reductionist explanations must ignore lower level molecular\ndetails, system-oriented immunologists attempt to understand the\nmultilevel complexity of the immune reactions they study (Rivas et al.\n2017). Dynamical systems theory and a variety of network-based\napproaches are used in systems biology to integrate distinct levels of\nanalysis and elucidate the complexity of the biological phenomena in question\n(Green et al. 2017). Accordingly, a pluralistic approach that attends\nto distinct dimensions and frames of reference, i.e., both molecular\nand higher orders of analysis, has directed recent efforts to\nintegrate the complexity immunity (L\u00f6wy 2008: 172; see entry on\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology).\n However, the program of melding the reductionist and holistic methods\nas complementary to each other has been slowed by both technical and\nconceptual hurdles (Fang and Casadevall 2011). How to model the system\nas a system requires the collection of information about the\ntotality of interactions to explain causal mechanisms with multiple\ninputs and stochastic outcomes. No approach has achieved dominance\nand, consequently, the question of how massive data might be\nincorporated into a systems-wide comprehensive model comprises a key\nchallenge of contemporary immunology.\n",
