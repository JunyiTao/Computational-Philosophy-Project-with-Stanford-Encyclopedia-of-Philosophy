    "main_text": "\n\nThe French Cartesian Nicolas Malebranche was hailed by his\ncontemporary, Pierre Bayle, as \u201cthe premier philosopher of our\nage.\u201d Over the course of his philosophical career, Malebranche\npublished major works on metaphysics, theology, and ethics, as well as\nstudies of optics, the laws of motion and the nature of color. He is\nknown principally for offering a highly original synthesis of the\nviews of his intellectual heroes, St. Augustine and Ren\u00e9\nDescartes. Two distinctive results of this synthesis are\nMalebranche\u2019s doctrine that we see bodies through ideas in God\nand his occasionalist conclusion that God is the only real cause.\n",
