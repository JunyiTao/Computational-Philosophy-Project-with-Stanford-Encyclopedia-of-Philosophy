    "main_text": "Rhetoric as a Counterpart to Dialectic\n3. Rhetoric as a Counterpart to Dialectic\n\nAristotle stresses right from the beginning of his Rhetoric\nthat rhetoric is closely related to dialectic. He offers several\nformulations to describe the affinity between these two disciplines:\nin the first line of the book Rhetoric rhetoric is said to be\na \u2018counterpart\u2019 (antistrophos) to dialectic\n(Rhet. I.1, 1354a1); in the second chapter of the first book\nit is also called an \u2018outgrowth\u2019 or \u2018offshoot\u2019\n(paraphues ti) of dialectic and the study of character\n(Rhet. I.2, 1356a25f.); finally, Aristotle says that rhetoric\nis part of dialectic and resembles it (Rhet. I.2,\n1356a30f.).\n\nIn saying that rhetoric is a counterpart to dialectic, Aristotle\nobviously wants to allude to Plato\u2019s Gorgias (464bff.),\nwhere rhetoric is ironically defined as a counterpart to cookery in\nthe soul. Since, in this passage, Plato uses the word\n\u2018antistrophos\u2019 to indicate an analogy, it is\nlikely that Aristotle wants to express a kind of analogy too: what\ndialectic is for the (private or academic) practice of attacking and\nmaintaining an argument, rhetoric is for the (public) practice of\ndefending oneself or accusing an opponent.\n\nThe notion of \u2018dialectic\u2019 is prominent in the work of\nAristotle\u2019s teacher, Plato; Plato often labels his philosophical\nmethod, or certain parts of it, as dialectic. In his dialogue\nGorgias (see \u00a74 of\n Plato: rhetoric and poetry),\n dialectic seems to be strictly opposed to rhetoric, the former aiming\nat the disclosure of truth, the latter allegedly aiming at\n\u2018persuasion without knowledge\u2019. In his Phaedrus\nPlato pictures the relation between dialectic and rhetoric in a\ndifferent way (see \u00a75.1 of\n Plato: rhetoric and poetry);\n here he entertains the idea of a new philosophical rhetoric, quite\ndifferent from the then contemporary style of speech writing, which\nrests upon dialectic, the genuine philosophical method, for acquiring\ngenuine knowledge both of the subject matter of a speech and of the\nsoul of the audience. When Aristotle speaks of dialectic, he certainly\nhas his book Topics in mind, where he develops at some length\nan argumentative method for attacking and defending theses of any\ncontent (see \u00a78 of\n Aristotle: logic).\n Clearly, Aristotle\u2019s dialectical method was inspired by Plato\nand by the debates in Plato\u2019s Academy; however, while Plato\noften presents dialectic as a method for discovering and conveying\ntruth, Aristotelian dialectic is strictly confined to examining\nparticular claims or testing the consistency of a set of propositions\n(which in his view is different from establishing or proving the truth\nof a proposition). This is, in a nutshell, the context that must be\nkept in mind, when Aristotle presents \u2014 quite allusively \u2014\na new art of rhetoric by stressing its affinity to dialectic;\nobviously he plays upon his readers\u2019 expectations concerning the\nmeaning of dialectic and the relation between dialectic and rhetoric,\nas described by Plato. Those students of Plato\u2019s Academy who\nwere still suspicious about any engagement with rhetoric and public\nspeech possibly received the opening of Aristotle\u2019s\nRhetoric with its postulated affinity between rhetoric and\ndialectic either as a provoction or as some sort of joke.\n\nThis purported analogy between rhetoric and dialectic (as conceived by\nAristotle) can be substantiated by several common features of both\ndisciplines:\n\nBoth rhetoric and dialectic are concerned with things that do not\nbelong to a definite genus or are not the object of a specific\nscience.\nBoth rhetoric and dialectic are not dependent on the established\nprinciples of specific sciences.\nBoth rhetoric and dialectic have the function of providing\narguments.\nBoth rhetorical and dialectical arguments rely on assumptions or\npremises that are not established as true, but are only reputable or\naccepted by one group or the other (endoxa).\nBoth rhetoric and dialectic are concerned with both sides of an\nopposition, dialectic by constructing arguments for and against any\nthesis, rhetoric by considering what is possibly persuasive in any\ngiven case.\n\n\nThis analogy to dialectic has extremely significant ramifications for\nthe status of Aristotle\u2019s supposedly new art of rhetoric. Plato\nargued in his Gorgias that rhetoric could not be an art\n(techn\u00ea), since it is not related to a definite\nsubject, while real arts are defined by their specific subjects, as\ne.g. medicine or shoemaking are defined by their products (health and\nshoes). By claiming that rhetoric and dialectic are similar or\nanalogous, Aristotle suggests a quite different picture. The analogy\nis even meant to flesh out the thought that neither rhetoric nor\ndialectic are like ordinary arts (technai) or sciences with a\nlimited, well-defined subject matter. However, this should not be seen\nas a drawback, or so the analogy suggests, since the alleged\nshortcoming, i.e. that they do not have such a definite subject\nmatter, can be turned into a virtue, by entrusting to dialectic and\nrhetoric the practices that are common to all fields of rationality,\nnamely the various practices of argumentation. For even though\ndialectic has no definite subject, it is easy to see that it\nnevertheless employs a consistent method (both in Plato\u2019s and\nAristotle\u2019s understanding of dialectic), because dialectic has\nto grasp the ultimate reason why some arguments are valid and others\nare not. Now, if rhetoric is nothing but the counterpart to dialectic\nwithin the domain of public speech, it must be similarly grounded in\nan investigation of what is persuasive and what is not, and this, in\nturn, qualifies rhetoric as an art or, after all, as a discipline that\nis methodologically not inferior to dialectic.\n\nAs already indicated, it is crucial for both disciplines, dialectic\nand rhetoric, that they deal with arguments from accepted premises\n(endoxa). Dialecticians do not argue on the basis of\nestablished, scientific principles, but on the basis of only reputable\nassumptions, i.e. of what is accepted either by all or the many or the\nfew experts. In a similar vein, rhetoricians or orators try to hit\nassumptions that are already accepted by their audience, because they\nwant to persuade the addressees on the basis of their own convictions.\nOf course, owing to the different fields of application \u2014\nphilosophical\u2013academic debates in the case of dialectic, mostly\npublic speeches in the case of rhetoric \u2014 the situation is not\nquite the same. While e.g. the dialectician tries to test the\nconsistency of a set of propositions, the rhetorician tries to achieve\nthe persuasion of a given audience, and while dialectic proceeds by\nquestioning and answering, rhetoric for the most part proceeds in\ncontinuous\u2013monologic form. Still, and in spite of these\ndifferences, the method of both dialectic and rhetoric share the same\ncore idea that they have to hit certain, accepted assumptions of their\naddressees \u2014 the dialectical disputant in order to get the\nexplicit assent of the dialectical opponent, the rhetorician in order\nto base the rhetorical proofs on views the audience already finds\nconvincing. Furthermore, just as the dialectician is interested in\ndeductions and inductions for refuting the opponent\u2019s claims,\nthe rhetorician is interested in deductions and inductions that\nlogically connect (or seem to connect) the audience\u2019s existing\nconvictions with certain other views that the rhetorician wishes to\nestablish (see below\n \u00a7 6).\n For, indeed, Aristotle seems to think that arguments or proofs are\ncentral to any process of persuasion, for people are most or most\neasily persuaded, he says (Rhet. I.1, 1355a3f.), when they\nsuppose something to have been proven.\n\nHence the rhetorician who is willing to give a central place to\narguments or (rhetorical) proofs \u2014 and this seems to be the\npeculiar approach to rhetoric that Aristotle suggests at the beginning\nof his Rhetoric \u2014 can base his or her method of\npersuasion to a significant extent on the method of dialectical\nargumentation, as expounded in Aristotle\u2019s Topics (see\nRapp 2016 and 2018). And since the notion of \u2018dialectic\u2019\nis inextricably linked with a genuinely philosophical method, the\nimplied message of this dialectical turn of rhetoric seems to be that\nphilosophers, properly understood, have access to a method that is\nsuperior not only for internal academic discussions between\nphilosophers, but also for the so-called \u2018encounter with the\nmany\u2019 (Rhet. I.1, 1355a29, Topics I.2,\n101a35), i.e. for the purpose of addressing a mass audience with\nlittle or no education. As already indicated, Aristotle does not seem\nto have been the first to come up with the idea that\n\u2018true\u2019 rhetoric should become dialectical; however, while\nin Plato\u2019s Phaedrus the dialectical turn of rhetoric\nremains a mere sketch, Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric does not\nhesitate to set this idea into operation, most notably by adapting\nmost of the dialectical equipment developed elsewhere, especially in\nhis Topics. In many particular instances he just imports\ntechnical vocabulary from his dialectic (e.g. protasis,\nsullogismos, topos, endoxon); in many other\ninstances he redefines traditional rhetorical notions by his\ndialectical inventory, e.g. the enthymeme is redefined as a deduction,\nthe example is redefined as an induction, etc. Above all, the\nRhetoric introduces the use of the so-called topoi\n(see below\n \u00a7 7)\n that is typical for the dialectical method and is otherwise only\ntreated in Aristotle\u2019s works on dialectic, i.e. in\nTopics and Sophistical Refutations.\n",
