    "main_text": "Mind and Metaphysics || Nominalism\n6.3 Nominalism \n\n\nNominalism is primarily associated with a specific philosophical \nposition adopted by Buddhist philosophers of the \nlogico-epistemological tradition concerning the ontological status of\nuniversals. However, long before the development of Buddhist \nNominalism, Buddhist philosophers had adopted what might be properly \ntermed as a nominalist stance in regards to the nature of composite \nentities, including persons. Thus, discussions about the ontological \nstatus of the various elements of experience in the early Abhidharma \ntraditions were already framed by the distinction between things \nthat existed substantively (dravyasat) versus those that had\nonly nominal or conventional existence (praj\u00f1aptisat).\n\n\nIn the celebrated dialogue between the Buddhist philosopher \nN\u0101gasena and King Milinda (often identified with the \nGreco-Bactrian King Menander I, ca. 150 B.C.E.), we come across one \nof the first references to the notion that an individual exists only \nas an appellation or conventional designation (P\u0101li \npa\u00f1\u00f1atti, Skt, praj\u00f1apti). As \nN\u0101gasena declares in response to the King's question about who \nhe is or what is he known as: \u201cN\u0101gasena and so on\u2014is\nonly a generally understood term, a designation in common use. For \nthere is no permanent individuality (or self) involved in the \nmatter\u201d (Questions of King Milinda, II, 1, 25). \nN\u0101gasena's claim frames the nominalist tendency that is already \nat work in the Buddhist canonical literature: just as words such as \n\u2018chariot\u2019 are used only when certain parts are arranged \ntogether to form a spatio-temporal entity we ordinarily designate as \nsuch, so also an individual (satto) is nothing but a \nconventional designation that applies to the five aggregates. \n\n\nAlthough Abhidharma philosophical views on the kinds of entities that\nhave only nominal existence range widely, it is generally agreed that\npersons or individuals are always to be taken as nothing more than \nmerely conventional designations established on the basis of the five\naggregates, the domains of perceptual activity, and their respective \nelements. Note, however, that Abhidharma philosophers do not deny the\nphysical reality of aggregated entities and persons. Indeed, \nmateriality or form (r\u016bpa), which is also one of five \ncollections of aggregates, is generally considered to be an external,\nnon-mental reality. Rather, the two-tiered approach to the existence \nof phenomena, which distinguishes between substantial and nominal \nexistents, is meant to reject not the existence of extra mental \nentities proper, but rather the existence of all partite entities \nsuch as chairs, pots, and tables (cf. Kapstein 2001, 90 and \npassim; Siderits 2003, 33 and passim).\n\n\nIn the Abhidharma ontology only the atoms that compose the four \nelements are ultimately real. Thus, the theory of two levels of \nexistents implies a philosophical perspective that is best described \nas reductionism. On this view, only partless entities (i.e., atoms) \ncan be said to properly exist. The property-particulars of phenomenal\nexperience (the svalak\u1e63a\u1e47as) are real only \ninsofar as their atomic configurations provide a causal basis for the\narising of perceptual apprehension. But the Buddhist reductionist, as\nSiderits (2003, 13 and passim) has clearly argued, is not an\neliminativist. Unlike the eliminative materialist who regards \nconventional, folk-psychological discourse about persons as \nunsupported by, say, neuroscientific data (and thus is willing to \ndispense with a theory of persons altogether), the Buddhist \nreductionist merely points to the conventional nature of persons as \nordinarily conceived. Whether we consider the view of Buddhist \npersonalists such as the V\u0101ts\u012bputr\u012byas (or \nPudgalav\u0101dins), who hold that persons non-reductively supervene \nupon the psychophysical aggregates, or that of Buddhist reductionists\nwho treat persons as conventional designations, a theory of persons \nis retained. \n",
