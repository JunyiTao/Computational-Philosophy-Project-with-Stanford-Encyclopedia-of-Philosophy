    "main_text": "Scanlon\u2019s Challenge\n3. Scanlon\u2019s Challenge\n\nMoore\u2019s book was published in Cambridge, England, at the\nbeginning of the twentieth century. At the end of the same century, a\nbook was published in Cambridge, Mass., which also posed some serious\nchallenges to the notion of well-being: What Do We Owe to Each\nOther?, by T.M. Scanlon.\n\nMoore\u2019s ultimate aim in criticizing the idea of \u2018goodness\nfor\u2019 was to attack egoism. Likewise, Scanlon has an ulterior\nmotive in objecting to the notion of well-being\u2014to attack\nso-called \u2018teleological\u2019 or end-based theories of ethics,\nin particular, utilitarianism, which in its standard form requires us\nto maximize well-being. But in both cases the critiques stand\nindependently.\n\nOne immediately odd aspect of Scanlon\u2019s position that\n\u2018well-being\u2019 is an otiose notion in ethics is that he\nhimself seems to have a view on what well-being is. It involves, he\nbelieves, among other things, success in one\u2019s rational aims,\nand personal relations. But Scanlon claims that his view is not a\n\u2018theory of well-being\u2019, since a theory must explain what\nunifies these different elements, and how they are to be compared.\nAnd, he adds, no such theory is ever likely to be available, since\nsuch matters depend so much on context.\n\nScanlon does, however, implicitly make a claim about what unites these\nvalues: they are all constituents of well-being, as opposed to other\nkinds of value, such as aesthetic or moral. Nor is it clear why\nScanlon\u2019s view of well-being could not be developed so as to\nassist in making real-life choices between different values in\none\u2019s own life.\n\nScanlon suggests that we often make claims about what is good in our\nlives without referring to the notion of well-being, and indeed that\nit would often be odd to do so. For example, I might say, \u2018I\nlisten to Alison Krauss\u2019s music because I enjoy it\u2019, and\nthat will be sufficient. I do not need to go on to say, \u2018And\nenjoyment adds to my well-being\u2019.\n\nBut this latter claim sounds peculiar only because we already\nknow that enjoyment makes a person\u2019s life better for\nthem. And in some circumstances such a claim would anyway not be odd:\nconsider an argument with someone who claims that aesthetic experience\nis worthless, or with an ascetic. Further, people do use the notion of\nwell-being in practical thinking. For example, if I am given the\nopportunity to achieve something significant, which will involve\nconsiderable discomfort over several years, I may consider whether,\nfrom the point of view of my own well-being, the project is worth\npursuing.\n\nScanlon argues also that the notion of well-being, if it is to be\nphilosophically acceptable, ought to provide a \u2018sphere of\ncompensation\u2019\u2014a context in which it makes sense to say,\nfor example, that I am losing one good in my life for the sake of gain\nover my life as a whole. And, he claims, there is no such sphere. For\nScanlon, giving up present comfort for the sake of future health\n\u2018feels like a sacrifice\u2019.\n\nBut this does not chime with my own experience. When I donate blood,\nthis feels to me like a sacrifice, albeit a minor one. But when I\nvisit the dentist, it feels to me just as if I am weighing present\npains against potential future pains. And we can weigh different\ncomponents of well-being against one another. Consider a case in which\nyou are offered a job which is highly paid but many miles away from\nyour friends and family.\n\nScanlon denies that we need an account of well-being to understand\nbenevolence, since we do not have a general duty of benevolence, but\nmerely duties to benefit others in specific ways, such as to relieve\ntheir pain. But, from the philosophical perspective, it may be quite\nuseful to use the heading of \u2018benevolence\u2019 in order to\ngroup such duties. And, again, comparisons may be important: if I have\nseveral pro tanto duties of benevolence, not all of which can\nbe fulfilled, I shall have to weigh the various benefits I can provide\nagainst one another. And here the notion of well-being will again come\ninto play.\n\nFurther, if morality includes so-called \u2018imperfect\u2019 duties\nto benefit others, that is, duties that allow the agent some\ndiscretion as to when and how to assist, the lack of any overarching\nconception of well-being is likely to make the fulfillment of such\nduties problematic.\n",
