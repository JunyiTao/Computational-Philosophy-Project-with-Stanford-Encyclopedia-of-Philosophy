He was one of a group of\nscholars active in during the Jian An reign period\n(196\u2013220 CE) in the late Han, during which the Han emperor was a\nmere puppet and figurehead, and the region was torn in warfare between\ncompeting warlords such as the famous Cao Cao (whose son would\nestablish the Wei state in 220 CE), Liu Bei (who established a new\nstate also named Han, today referred to as Shu Han, in the same year),\nand Sun Quan (who founded the state of Wu). Known as the \u201cThree\nKingdoms\u201d, these states would vie for supremacy for almost a\ncentury, until the reunification by the Jin Dynasty in 280 CE. This\nwas one of the most famous periods of Chinese history, immortalized by\nthe fourteenth century CE writer Luo Guanzhong\u2019s classic novel\nSanguo Yanyi (\u201cRomance of the Three Kingdoms\u201d).\nXu Gan was one of the scholars known as the \u201cSeven Masters of\nJian An\u201d. Five of the seven died in the plague of 217 CE,\nincluding Xu Gan, only 47 years old at the time.\n\nWhile he was concerned with many of the standard Confucian issues,\nsuch as the efficacy of ritual, the need for moral self-cultivation,\nand creating proper moral motivation (among others), his most unique\ncontribution was in the area of language, particularly in the\nconsideration of the connection between language, reality, and moral\nbehavior. Xu followed the kind of critical evaluative methodology\ndeveloped by philosophers such as Huan Tan and Wang Chong. A number of\nthe essays of his major work, Zhonglun (Discourses Hitting\nthe Mark), focus on criticisms of common views and practices Xu saw as\nultimately harmful to the individual and society, such as\n\u201cdisputing\u201d without aiming at truth. In a passage\nreminiscent of Wang Chong, in his chapter Hebian (\u201cAn\nExamination of Disputation\u201d), Xu writes:\n\n\nWhat the vulgar person calls \u201cdisputation\u201d is not\ndisputation at all. That he should call it disputation, though it is\nnot, is probably because he has heard the name\n\u201cdisputation\u201d but does not know its actuality.\nAccordingly, we regard this as preposterous. The person who is\ncommonly referred to as \u201cdisputer\u201d is, in fact, a glib\nperson. The glib person readily embellishes the tone of his voice and\nmultiplies his retorts, just like the onset of a gale, or the downpour\nof a rainstorm. Disregarding the inherent rights and wrongs of a\nsituation, and not understanding the principles of truth and\ndistortion, he fixes it so that he is never at a loss for words and\nworks at securing certain victory. [\u2026] Disputation is about\npersuading people in their hearts; it is not about verbal submission.\nHence disputation is to articulate distinctions, and also to separate\nand distinguish different categories of affairs skillfully, so as to\narrange them clearly. Disputation does not mean being quick-witted in\none\u2019s words and speech to talk over people\u2019s heads.\n(Zhonglun 8.1, Makeham [trans] 2002: xxiv\u2013xxv)\n\n\nXu\u2019s theory of the connection between names (ming) and\nactualities (shi) drew on but further developed earlier views\nof the efficacy of language in moral development. Names, or terms,\nshould be applied to things in particular ways that suggest proper\nuses. We can improperly apply names when we apply them not with the\naim of communal harmony or individual moral instruction, but with the\naim of advancing our own reputations or selfish interest. When we use\nnames in these unsatisfactory ways, this reduces their efficacy in\ncreating the kinds of motivational effect that is the fundamental use\nof names. The key in using names correctly is to ensure that names are\ntied to the actualities with which these names are associated. Xu\ndescribes the connection between name and actuality:\n\n\nA name is that which is used to name an actuality. When an actuality\nhas been established, its name follows after it; it is not the case\nthat a name is established and then its actuality follows after it.\nThus if a long shape is established, then it will be named\n\u201clong\u201d, and if a short shape is established, it will be\nnamed \u201cshort\u201d. It is not the case that the names\n\u201clong\u201d and \u201cshort\u201d are first established and\nthen the long and short shapes follow after them. That which Confucius\nvalued were those \u201cnames\u201d which truly name actualities. In\nso valuing names, he thereby valued actualities. Names are tied to\nactualities just as plants are tied to the seasons. In the spring,\nplants blossom into flower; in summer, they are covered in leaves; in\nautumn, their foliage withers and falls; and in winter, they bear\nfruit. This is not acting for a specific purpose and yet the plant\ncompletes itself. If a plant is forced, its natural tendencies will be\nharmed. It is the same with names. Hence, false name makers are all\nthose who would harm names. People are aware only of the good that is\ndone by names and are ignorant of the bad that is done by false name\nmakers. (Zhonglun 11.5, Makeham [trans.] 2002:\n149\u2013150)\n\n\nActualities (shi \u5be6), for Xu Gan, are independent of\nhuman activity and \u201cestablished\u201d (li \u7acb) by\nthe world itself. John Makeham defines Xu Gan\u2019s conception of\nactuality as\n\n\na state of development peculiar to an entity or state of affairs by\nvirtue of which that entity or state of affairs is what it is.\n(Makeham 1994: 27)\n\n\nA name or term is attached naturally to this\u2014while our language\nis in some sense conventional, actualities are described by particular\nnames independently of the way we accord these names to objects.\nXu\u2019s example in the above passage of \u201clong\u201d\ndemonstrates this. When we describe a particular object as\n\u201clong\u201d, we use an already existent term, with an\nindependent meaning, to describe a particular actuality. The\nconnection between this name and the actuality of an object is\ndetermined independently of our determination. We can choose to\ncorrectly use the term \u201clong\u201d to describe the object or\nincorrectly use the term \u201cshort\u201d, but the latter term does\nnot match the actuality of the long object (setting aside here the\nissue of the issue of the conventional or comparison-relative nature\nof concepts such as long and short). A name, according to Xu, follows\nor it attached naturally to a particular actuality, and to improperly\nuse a name (to call the long thing \u201cshort\u201d, for example)\nis to damage the nature (xing \u6027) of that name. Its\nnature is damaged due to improper associations based on incorrect use.\nWhen we use the term \u201cshort\u201d to describe things that are\nlong, this throws people into confusion concerning the term\n\u201cshort\u201d as well as the term \u201clong\u201d. We can no\nlonger clearly describe the actualities of things, because of the\nobfuscation of associations. Using the term \u201cshort\u201d will\nafter time become unable to express the actuality, as its application\nto things without the actuality corresponding to the name will become\npart of the accepted or expected usage of the name, and the name will\nlose its proper meaning. \u201cShort\u201d will come to mean\n\u201clong\u201d to some, \u201cshort\u201d to others, and\n\u201can open question as to long or short\u201d to many as\nwell.\n\nFor Xu, as for Confucians more generally, creating confusion\nconcerning names is most harmful because it impedes the process of\nmoral cultivation and maintenance of social harmony. One important\nsource of incorrect use of names is disputation by those seeking to\ngain a name for themselves rather than seeking the truth. When\none\u2019s goal is simply to look better than others in disputation,\nrespecting the connection between names and actualities is not\nimportant. Those whose focus is on disputation for this reason are\ndangerous. Proper disputation, according to Xu, aims to attain truth\nso as to achieve individual and social moral development. Xu\nwrites:\n\n\nThe glib person readily embellishes the tone of his voice and\nmultiplies his retorts, just like the onset of a gale, or the downpour\nof a rainstorm. Disregarding the inherent rights and wrongs of a\nsituation, and not understanding the principles of truth and\ndistortion, he fixes it so that he is never at a loss for words and\nworks at securing certain victory. [\u2026] The words used in\ndisputation should be terse and to the point, unconvoluted and\ninformative. The tempo of their delivery needs to be modulated so that\nthey do not transgress the ritual teachings and their import should\nserve as a worthy complement to those teachings. (Zhonglun\n8,1. Makeham [trans] 2002: 99\u2013100)\n\n\nInstead of looking to further one\u2019s reputation by means of\nduplicitous application of names and thus reducing the efficacy and\nmeaning of names, one should strive to cultivate virtue (de\n\u5fb7), which is the actuality of the exemplary person\n(junzi \u541b\u5b50). With the elevation of one\u2019s\nactuality, both reputation and authority will increase naturally (as\nmoral influence is gained with name and fame).\n\nAs with previous Confucian thinkers, Xu recognizes that those who are\nauthentically virtuous are not always successful. Indeed, he thinks\nthat the situation in the Eastern Han is such that those with the\nhighest positions are far from virtuous. He explains this in the\nstandard Confucian way by explaining that the times (shi)\nmake a difference, and that even the most virtuous scholar will not\nmeet with fortune if encountering the wrong time. What constitutes the\ntime (shi) is a matter of communal habits, beliefs, quality\nof rulership, and natural state. If one is born into a time of decay\nin a state, with weak and unvirtuous leadership, disasters like\ndrought, and communal apathy, then one will likely not advance to a\nhigh state of reputation, even with the highest virtue. This is a\nsituation that Confucians from the earliest times worried about, and\nwe see it discussed in all of the thinkers mentioned here from the\nEastern Han as well. Echoing Wang Fu, however, Xu Gan holds that if\nthe times are such that the virtuous person cannot thrive in society,\none should abandon society and focus on developing his own qualities\n(Makeham 1994: xii).\n\nXu Gan uses the structure of ben-mo \u672c\u672b (roots\nand branches) developed in earlier Han texts such as the Huainanzi to\nexplain the relationship between virtue (de \u5fb7) and\nhuman arts (yi \u85dd). He reverses what we see in thought\nof Jia Yi, who takes virtue to be an adornment and guide for\ngoverning. Xu argues that the arts (including ritual and even\npresumably governing) cannot be perfected without virtue. At the same\ntime, he asserts that virtue also cannot be completed (cheng\n\u6210) without the arts. The two are interdependent\n(Zhonglun 7.1).\n\nOne aspect of Xu Gan\u2019s thought which have led some to declare\nhim (and some similar Han thinkers) as a \u201cLegalist\u201d\n(fajia \u6cd5\u5bb6) philosopher is his endorsement of\nthe view that timely and consistent reward and punishment are\nessential tools for governing, shared by Warring States legalist\nthinkers such as Han Feizi, Shang Yang, and Shen Buhai (Makeham 1994:\n264, Zhonglun 19). While, as I mention above, school\ncategories are of limited use in categorizing Eastern Han thinkers, Xu\ncertainly has much more in common with early Confucians than with\nWarring States Legalists, even though it becomes more popular in the\nEastern Han to adopt the Legalist position concerning reward and\npunishment.\n",
