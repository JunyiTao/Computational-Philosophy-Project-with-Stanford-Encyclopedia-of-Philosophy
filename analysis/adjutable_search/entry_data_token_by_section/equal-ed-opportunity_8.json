    "main_text": "The Meaning of and Debates about Equality of Educational Opportunity || Fair Equality of Educational Opportunity\n3.4 Fair Equality of Educational Opportunity\n\nBecause of the limits of formal equality of opportunity, John Rawls\ndeveloped a conception he calls Fair Equality of Opportunity (FEO).\nFEO requires that social offices and positions be formally open to\nall, and that individuals who are similarly talented and motivated\nshould have a roughly equal chance to attain these positions,\nindependent of their social class background (Rawls 2001:\n42\u201344). FEO holds that all citizens of a society count as the\nrelevant agents, the desired goal is offices and positions, and the\nobstacles people should not face includes their social class\nbackground. The obstacles people may legitimately face include having\nfewer developed abilities or less willingness to use them.\n\nWhen applied to education, this principle may support educational\nmeasures that close the achievement gap between the rich and the poor\nwith the same high talent potentials, assuming that these children can\nbe identified. This is because such students from poorer backgrounds\nshould fare as well as their wealthier peers with the same potentials.\nThe Rawlsian principle of FEO aims to eliminate the effects of social\nbackground and economic class on educational achievement. Fair\nequality of opportunity therefore offers a radical interpretation of\nequality of educational opportunity.\n",
