    "main_text": "Early Developments to the 1320s || The Theory of Restriction\n2.4 The Theory of Restriction\n\nEven when not combined with transcasus or the theory that\ndistinguishes exercised act from signified act, a very popular\napproach throughout the insolubilia-literature, in the early\nperiod (and for that matter even in our own day), before\nBradwardine\u2019s sustained attack on it (see\n  Section 3.1),\n was to deny or restrict the possibility of self-reference. Such\ntheories had the title \u201crestriction\u201d (restrictio)\nand their proponents were called \u201crestricters\u201d\n(restringentes). All such theories maintained that in some or\neven all cases, terms in propositions could not \u201csupposit\nfor\u201d (stand for, refer to) the propositions in which they\noccur.\n\nSome theories of restriction went further and also ruled out other\npatterns of reference. For example:\n\nProposition a = \u2018b is true\u2019, and\nb = \u2018a is false\u2019 (the\n\u2018yes\u2019-\u2018no\u2019 paradox). Here a refers to\nb and b refers back to a. But reference is not a\ntransitive relation, so that there is no real self-reference\nhere. Nevertheless, the situation is paradoxical, and as a result some\nrestricters ruled out all referential \u201cloops\u201d.\nProposition a is a certain token of the form\n\u2018a is false\u2019, and b is a second token of the\nsame type. Token a is self-referential, but token b is\nnot, since it refers to a, not to itself. Yet some restricters\nthought the two tokens should be treated semantically alike, so that\nnot only could the subject of a not refer to a itself,\nneither could the subject of b.\nProposition a = \u2018b is true\u2019, and\nproposition b = \u2018b is false\u2019. Here, b\nis self-referential, but a is not. Nevertheless, b is\nthe contradictory of a. Hence, by saying its contradictory is\ntrue, a is in effect saying that it itself is false. Thus,\nalthough it is not self-referential, a is nevertheless\nparadoxical. Some restricters prevented such cases by maintaining that\nnot only were terms unable to refer to the propositions in which they\noccurred, they also could not refer to the contradictories of\nthe propositions in which they occurred.\n\n\nAs a general theory, restriction is open to an obvious objection: it\nrules out innocuous forms of reference along with pathological ones.\nThe sentence \u201cThis sentence has five words\u201d is not\nparadoxical, after all, even though it is self-referential; in fact,\nit seems obviously true. Yet the general theory of restriction would\ndisallow it.\n\nMedieval authors sometimes raised this objection. As a result, we find\ntwo kinds of restriction-theories in the medieval literature:\n(a) general or strong theories that rule out self-reference, and\nperhaps other patterns of reference too, in innocuous as well as\npathological cases; and (b) more specialized or weaker theories that\nrule out certain forms of reference only when they result in paradox.\nWalter Burley and William of Ockham, for example, held the latter form\nof restriction (Spade 1974).\n\nIf general or strong theories of restriction are open to the objection\nstated above, the weaker theories are open to a different objection:\nthey risk being vacuous if their proponents did not have any\nindependent way of identifying paradoxical cases. Perhaps, their\ntheories amounted to saying \u201call forms of reference are allowed,\nexcept for paradoxical ones, which are not allowed\u201d. This is no\ndoubt true, but it is also a\n tautology.[17]\n The restrictivist response largely died out after Bradwardine\u2019s\nattack on it in chs. 3\u20134 of his Insolubles. However, in\nthe late 1320s, Walter de Segrave (or Sexgrave) gave a spirited\ndefence of restrictivism against Bradwardine\u2019s arguments (see\n  Section 3.2\n and Spade 1975 item LXVIII, pp. 113\u20136).\n\n",
