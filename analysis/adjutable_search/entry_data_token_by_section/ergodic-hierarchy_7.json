A frequently heard objection (which we have already\nencountered in Section 4) is that EH and more generally ergodic theory\nare irrelevant since most systems (including those that we are\nultimately interested in) are not ergodic at\n all.[23]\n\n\nThis charge is less acute than it appears at first glance. First, it\nis important to emphasise that it is not the sheer number of\napplications that make a physical concept important, but whether there\nare some important systems that are ergodic. And there are examples of\nsuch systems. For example, so-called \u2018hard-ball systems\u2019\n(and some more sophisticated variants of them) are effective\nidealizations of the dynamics of gas molecules, and these systems seem\nto be ergodic;for details, see Berkovitz, Frigg and Kronz 2006,\nSection 3.2, Vranas (1998) and Frigg and Werndl (2011).\n\nFurthermore, EH can be used to characterize randomness and chaos in\nboth ergodic and non-ergodic systems. Even if a system as a whole is\nnot ergodic (i.e., if it fails to be ergodic with respect to the\nentire phase space \\(X)\\), there can be (and usually there\nare) subsets of \\(X\\) on which the system is ergodic. This is what\nLichtenberg and Libermann (1992, p. 295) have in mind when they\nobserve that \u2018[i]n a sense, ergodicity is universal, and the\ncentral question is to define the subspace over which it\nexists\u2019. In fact, non-ergodic systems may have subsets that are\nnot only ergodic, but even Bernoulli! It then becomes interesting\nto ask what these subsets are, what their measures are, and what\ntopological features they have. These are questions studied in parts\nof dynamical systems theory, most notably KAM theory. Hence, KAM\ntheory does not demonstrate that ergodic theory is not useful in\nanalyzing the dynamical behavior of real physical systems (as is often\nclaimed). Indeed, KAM systems have regions in which the system\nmanifest either merely ergodic or Bernoulli behaviour, and accordingly\nEH is useful for charactering the dynamical properties of such systems\n(Berkovitz, Frigg and Kronz 2006, Section 4). Further, as we have\nmentioned in Section 4.1, almost all Hamiltonian systems are\nnon-integrable, and accordingly they have large regions of the phase\nspace in which their motion is ergodic-like. So EH is a useful tool in\nstudying the dynamical properties of systems even if the system fails\nto be ergodic tout court.\n\nAnother frequently heard objection is that EH is irrelevant in\npractice because most levels of EH (in fact, all except Bernoulli) are\ndefined in terms of infinite time limits and hence remain\nsilent about what happens in finite time. But all we ever\nobserve are finite times and so EH is irrelevant to physics as\npracticed by actual scientists.\n\nThis charge can be dispelled by a closer look at the definition of a\nlimit, which shows that infinite limits in fact have\nimportant implications for the dynamical behaviour of the system in\nfinite times. The definition of a limit is as follows (where \\(f\\) is\nan arbitrary function of time): lim\\(_{t\\rightarrow \\infty} f(t) = c\\)\niff for every \\(\\varepsilon \\gt 0\\) there exists an \\(t\u2019 \\gt 0\\) so\nthat for all \\(t \\gt t\u2019\\) we have \\(\\lvert f(t) - c\\rvert \\lt\n\\varepsilon\\). In words, for every number \\(\\varepsilon\\), no matter\nhow small, there is a finite time \\(t\u2019\\) after which the\nvalues of \\(f\\) differ from \\(c\\) by less then \\(\\varepsilon\\). That\nis, once we are past \\(t\u2019\\) the values of \\(f\\) never move more than\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) away from \\(c\\). With this in mind strong mixing, for\ninstance, says that for a given threshold \\(\\varepsilon\\) there exists\na finite time \\(t_n (n\\) units of time after the current\ntime) after which \\(C(T_n B, A)\\) is always smaller than\n\\(\\varepsilon\\). We are free to choose \\(\\varepsilon\\) to be an\nempirically relevant margin, and so we know that if a system is\nmixing, we should expect the correlations between the states of the\nsystem after t\\(_n\\) and its current state to be below\n\\(\\varepsilon\\). The upshot is that in strong mixing systems, being in\na state \\(B\\) at some past time becomes increasingly irrelevant for\nits probability of being in the state \\(A\\) now, as the temporal\ndistance between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) becomes larger. Thus, the fact that\nsystem is strong mixing clearly has implications for its dynamical\nbehaviour in finite times. Furthermore, often (although not always)\nconvergence proofs provide effective bounds on rates of convergence\nand these bounds can be used to inform expectations about behaviour at\na given time.\n\nSince different levels of EH correspond to different degrees of\nrandomness, each explicated in terms of a different type of asymptotic\ndecay of correlations between states of systems at different times,\none might suspect that a similar pattern can be found in the rates of\ndecay. That is, one might be tempted to think that EH can equally be\ncharacterized as a hierarchy of increasing rates of decay of\ncorrelations: a K-system, for instance, which exhibits exponential\ndivergence of trajectories would be characterized by an exponential\nrate of decay of correlations, while a SM-system would exhibit a\npolynomial rate of decay.\n\nThis, unfortunately, does not work. Natural as it may seem, EH cannot\nbe interpreted as a hierarchy of increasing rates of decay of\ncorrelations. It is a mathematical fact that there is no particular\nrate of decay associated with each level of EH. For instance, one can\nconstruct K-systems in which the decay is as slow as one wishes it to\nbe. So the rate of decay is a feature of particular systems rather\nthan of a level of EH.\n",
