    "main_text": "Applied Questions in Immigration || Guest Workers\n3.2 Guest Workers\n\n\nThe classic analysis of guest workers is Michael Walzer\u2019s\ndiscussion of Western European countries\u2019 former practice of\nhiring laborers from nearby states such as Turkey. This practice\nwas a sensible solution for all, since it enabled a country like West\nGermany to hire foreign workers to do various relatively onerous jobs\nfor considerably less than it would have had to pay its domestic labor\nforce, and the imported laborers also profited, as they were able to\nearn considerably more than they could have in their own\ncountries. Walzer objects to this practice, however, because\nthese workers were not given equal political status in their host\ncountries. Even when Turkish workers lived in West Germany with\ntheir families for many years, for instance, they would have no chance\nof acquiring German citizenship. For understandable reasons,\nWalzer is deeply troubled by the creation of this political\nunderclass. As he puts it, \u201cThese guests experience the\nstate as a pervasive and frightening power that shapes their lives and\nregulates their every move\u2014and never asks for their\nopinion. Departure is only a formal option; deportation, a\ncontinuous practical threat. As a group, they constitute a\ndisenfranchised class. They are typically exploited or oppressed\nas a class as well, and they are exploited or oppressed at least in\npart because they are disenfranchised, incapable of organizing\neffectively for self-defense.\u201d (Walzer 1983: 59) As a\nconsequence, Walzer insists that, while countries are perfectly within\ntheir rights to either hire or exclude foreign workers, they are not\nfree to bring in outsiders without according them all the standard\nrights and privileges of equal citizenship. Thus, if a country is\nwilling to embrace foreign workers as political equals, it may invite\nin as many as it would like. If a political community is\nunwilling to treat guest workers as equals, on the other hand, then it\nmay not hire them and must pay the higher wages demanded by the\ndomestic labor market.\n\n\nPolitical theorists typically take for granted that states must\ntreat all of their constituents as free and equal, so it is no wonder\nthat so many are attracted to Walzer\u2019s analysis of guest\nworkers. (And it should be noted that countries like Germany have\nsince dramatically revised their guest worker policies, so that they\nare now much more in accord with Walzer\u2019s recommendations.)\nStill, at least two big questions present themselves. First, even\nif we assume that Walzer is correct that long-term visitors like those\nemployed in Western European countries must eventually be given the\nopportunity to become citizens, it does not follow that all guest\nworkers must be treated as equal citizens. What if Walzer were to\nspend a year as a Visiting Professor at the Sorbonne, for\nexample? Would this arrangement be morally impermissible if the\noffer did not give Walzer full voting rights in France for that\nyear? Presumably not. If so, then there are interesting and\ndifficult questions about how long and under what conditions one can\nwork in a foreign country without the standard rights and privileges of\nequal citizenship before one becomes objectionably treated as a\npolitical subordinate.\n\n\nSecond and more important, even if we presume that political states\nmust generally treat their constituents as free and equal\ncitizens, it is controversial whether this requirement should apply in\nthe case of guest workers. Because most accept the principle of\nvolenti non fit injuria, it is typically presumed that a\nrelationship among unequals need not be unjust, especially if both\nparties freely consent to the relationship. There need not be\nanything unjust about an arrangement in which an employee has a much\nless desirable set of powers, privileges and responsibilities than her\nemployer, for instance, as long as the employee freely and with full\ninformation accepted these terms of employment. Of course,\npolitical states are still required to treat their constituents as free\nand equal citizens precisely because the volenti principle is\ngenerally irrelevant to relations among compatriots. In other\nwords, states coerce all those within their territorial boundaries\nwhether or not these constituents have consented to this imposition;\nand, given this, they cannot invoke volenti and thus have no\nchoice but to treat everyone coerced as equals. Importantly,\nthough, guest workers are an exception to this general rule precisely\nbecause they do give their consent to the relationship.\nUnlike most of the state\u2019s constituents, guest workers are not\ncoerced by the adoptive state unless they decide that they would like\nto accept the terms of employment and move to the new country. As a\nconsequence, it is not clear that the volenti principle should\nnot apply in the case of guest workers.\n",
