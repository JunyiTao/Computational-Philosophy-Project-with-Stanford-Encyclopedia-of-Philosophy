    "main_text": "The unprovability of consistency\n3. The unprovability of consistency\n\n\nAfter G\u00f6del had made public the incompleteness of arithmetic in\nSeptember 1930, von Neumann found that the consistency of arithmetic\nwould be among the G\u00f6delian unprovable propositions. Alas, G\u00f6del had\nmade the same discovery so von Neumann never published his proof. He\ndid, however, conjecture in correspondence with G\u00f6del the\nunprovability of the consistency of arithmetic and therefore of\nmathematics as a whole, in some absolute sense. Von Neumann was the\nkey character in the reception of G\u00f6del's results: He interrupted his\nlectures on Hilbert's proof theory in Berlin in the fall of 1930 to\nexplain the new discoveries. These events created an enormous\nexcitement among the mathematicians, as witnessed by Carl Hempel's\ntestimony:\n\nI took a course there with von Neumann which dealt with Hilbert's\nattempt to prove the consistency of classical mathematics by finitary\nmeans. I recall that in the middle of the course von Neumann came in\none day and announced that he had just received a paper from\u2026 Kurt\nG\u00f6del who showed that the objectives which Hilbert had in mind\nand on which I had heard Hilbert's course in G\u00f6ttingen could not\nbe achieved at all. Von Neumann, therefore, dropped the pursuit of\nthis subject and devoted the rest of the course to the presentation of\nG\u00f6del's results.  The finding evoked an enormous excitement.\n(Hempel 2000, p. 13)\n\n\n\nIn 1932\u201333, G\u00f6del and Gentzen found independently of each \nother a translation from classical Peano arithmetic to \n intuitionistic Heyting arithmetic.\n Specifically, it shows that if a contradiction is provable in the \nformer, it is provable in the latter. Then the consistency of \nintuitionistic arithmetic would guarantee also the consistency of \nclassical arithmetic. This result was a surprise: as mentioned, \nHilbert had thought that the \u201ctransfinite\u201d indirect \nexistence proofs would be the part of arithmetic that needs to be \nsecured of contradiction. By G\u00f6del's and Gentzen's result, \nalready intuitionistic arithmetic contained principles that went \nbeyond finitary reasoning. A letter Gentzen wrote to Heyting on 25 \nFebruary 1933 summarizes the situation as follows:\n\nA consistency proof by finite means has \u2026 not succeeded so far,\nso that this original aim of Hilbert has not been achieved. If, on the\nother hand, one admits the intuitionistic position as a secure basis\nin itself, i.e., as a consistent one, the consistency of classical\narithmetic is secured by my result. If one wished to satisfy Hilbert's\nrequirements, the task would still remain of showing intuitionistic\narithmetic consistent. This, however, is not possible by even the\nformal apparatus of classical arithmetic, on the basis of G\u00f6del's\nresult in combination with my proof. Even so, I am inclined to believe\nthat a consistency proof for intuitionistic arithmetic, from an even\nmore evident position, is possible and also desirable. (Menzler-Trott\n2007, p. 38)\n\n\n\nThe last-mentioned was the goal Gentzen had set to himself early in \n1932, when in a letter to his old teacher Hellmuth Kneser he wrote:\n\nI have set as my specific task to find a proof of the consistency of\nlogical deduction in arithmetic\u2026 The task becomes a purely\nmathematical problem through the formalization of logical\ndeduction. The proof of consistency has been so far carried out only\nfor special cases, for example, the arithmetic of the integers without\nthe rule of complete induction. I would like to proceed further at\nthis point and to clear at least arithmetic with complete induction. I\nam working on this since almost a year and hope to finish soon, and\nwould then present this work as my dissertation (with Prof. Bernays).\n(Menzler-Trott 2007, p. 31)\n\n",
