    "main_text": "Causation and Free Will || Motives and Actions\n4.3 Motives and Actions\n\n\nWhy should we believe that human beings have moral liberty, i.e. why\nshould we think that we are endowed with power to produce our actions?\nWe have reason to think that we are not the efficient causes of our\nown behavior. Our actions seem to come about according to\npsychological laws linking them to prior motives for action. Jealous,\ngenerous, prideful and benevolent motives lead in apparently law-like\nways to various characteristic behaviors. If it is a fact that our\nconduct comes about according to laws, then it seems that the author\nof the laws, if there is one, is the real author of our actions. \n\n \nReid denies that there are laws linking motives with behavior, or in\nhis terms he denies that motives are the physical causes of action. He\noffers a variety of fascinating arguments for this claim. The most\nimportant of these arguments is summarized quite clearly in Reid's\ncorrespondence, and presented at greater length in Essays on the\nActive Powers 4.4. In the correspondence he writes: \nIt is a question of fact, whether the influence of motives\nbe fixed by laws of nature, so that they shall always have the same\neffect in the same circumstances. Upon this, indeed, the question\nabout liberty and necessity hangs. But I have never seen any proof\nthat there are such laws of nature, far less any proof that the\nstrongest motive always prevails. However much our late fatalists have\nboasted of this principle as of a law of nature, without ever telling\nus what they mean by the strongest motive, I am persuaded that,\nwhenever they shall be pleased to give us any measure of the strength\nof motives distinct from their prevalence, it will appear, from\nexperience, that the strongest motive does not always prevail. If no\nother test or measure of the strength of motives can be found but\ntheir prevailing, then this boasted principle will be only an\nidentical proposition, and signify only that the strongest motive is\nthe strongest motive, and the motive that prevails is the motive that\nprevails\u2014which proves nothing. (Letter to James Gregory,\nin Correspondence 176)\n\n\nReid assumes that anybody who holds that there is a law linking\nmotives and behaviors will thereby accept the claim that human beings\nalways act on the strongest of their motives. However, Reid claims\nthat there are various ways in which the notion of the strongest\nmotive can be defined\u2014there are various measures of\nstrength of motive\u2014and depending which definition is employed we\nfind that it is either false or trivial and uninformative to say that\npeople always act on the strongest motive.\n\n\nReid identifies three particularly important senses in which the\nstrength of a motive can be measured: by, to use his terms, its\n\u2018prevalence\u2019, its \u2018animal strength\u2019, or its \u2018rational\nstrength\u2019. According to the view that associates strength with\nprevalence, the strongest motive is just the motive on which the agent\nacts. Under this view, there is no way of assessing the strength of\nmotives prior to seeing what the agent does. The animal strength of a\nmotive is the degree to which it is felt, the degree to which the\nagent might be said to have an urge for its object. The\nrational strength of a motive is the degree to which the act it\ndictates is judged to be worthwhile by the agent. \n\n\nAs Reid puts the point in the above quotation, the claim that people\nalways act on their strongest motive when strength is associated with\nprevalence is \u2018an identical proposition.\u2019 It is true but trivial, and\nit fails to show that people are not the efficient causes of their own\nbehavior. After all, under the view of strength as prevalence, the\nterm \u2018strongest motive\u2019 can be replaced with the term \u2018the motive on\nwhich the agent acts\u2019 and thus \u2018People always act on their strongest\nmotive\u2019 becomes \u2018People always act on the motive on which they\nact\u2019. True, but hardly the sort of truth from which anything\ninteresting follows. \n\n\nOn the other hand, under either the view that the strongest motive is\nthe strongest animal motive, or the view that the strongest motive is\nthe strongest rational motive, it is false that people always act on\nthe strongest motive, thinks Reid. People sometimes do what they judge\nto be right, even though they have a much stronger urge to do\nsomething else. And people sometimes give in to their urges, contrary\nto their better judgment. Both of these claims can be questioned. We\nmight say, for instance, that people who act as dictated by their\njudgment actually have an urge to do so, an urge that counterbalances\ntheir urge to do otherwise. And, we might say that people who act on\ntheir urges, and counter to their best judgment, don't actually judge\nthe alternative to be better, but do so only in some watered-down\nsense. Notice, however, that anyone who objects to Reid on either of\nthese two grounds seems to already accept that people always act on\nthe strongest of their motives in one sense or another. It is that\nprior acceptance that motivates the objection. Reid, by contrast,\ntakes the facts that we sometimes act as dictated by our urges,\nsometimes as dictated by our judgments, to be a prior fact that any\ntheory must account for, rather than a consequence of a theory of\nmotivation. Hence, he takes any theory that does not allow for these\nconsequences to be flawed, and takes himself to have shown that there\nis no satisfactory sense in which people always act on the strongest\nof their motives. \n\n\nReid's argument does not decisively settle the question of whether or\nnot human conduct comes about in accordance with laws linking it to\nprior motives. Rather, what he has shown is that we cannot accept the\nclaim that human conduct is law governed through simple reflection\nfrom the armchair. We do need to do careful conceptual work in order\nto provide a non-trivial definition of strength that is different from\neither the animal or rational definitions; but we also need to do\ncareful empirical work in behavioral psychology in order to determine\nif people do, indeed, always act on the strongest of motives in the\nsense of strength that we develop. His argument, then, makes a\ncontribution to the question of whether or not people are the\nefficient causes of their own behavior by posing a further, and\ndifficult problem for those, like Hume, who deny it on the grounds\nthat our behavior is law-governed.\n",
