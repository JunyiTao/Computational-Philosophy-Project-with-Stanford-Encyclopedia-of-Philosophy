    "main_text": "Psychology || Soul as a Harmony\n5.2 Soul as a Harmony\n\nMacrobius (5th century AD) is the only ancient source to attribute to\nPhilolaus the doctrine that the soul is a harmony (DK 44 A23). It is not clear that this ascription is based on\nanything in Philolaus\u2019 book, moreover, and it may just be a conclusion\nbased on the espousal of the doctrine by Simmias, who is presented as\na pupil of Philolaus, in Plato\u2019s Phaedo (86b5 ff.). The\ndoctrine as presented in the Phaedo may be Plato\u2019s invention\nbased on several Presocratic sources (Mansfeld 2010b: 183\u2013188).\nHowever, since Philolaus believed that all things were either\nlimiters, unlimiteds or harmonious combinations of limiters and\nunlimiteds, it is not implausible that he would have regarded soul as\nsuch a harmony of limiter and unlimited. In Fr. 13 soul\n(psych\u00ea) is the center of emotions and desires, is\nassociated with sense perception, and has its seat in the heart (see\n5.1 above). Sedley argues that Philolaus\u2019 embryology (see 6.1 below)\nsuggests that a body is first ensouled when the heat (an unlimited) of\nthe embryo was cooled, and hence limited, by breath. The soul can thus\nbe viewed as a harmony of these and other opposites, which is the view\nthat Simmias presents in the Phaedo (Sedley 1995,\n22\u20136). In the Phaedo, however, the view that the soul\nis a harmony of parts of the body is shown to be in conflict with its\nimmortality. Some have thus thought that Philolaus did not believe in\nthe immortality of the soul or transmigration (see now McKirahan 2016). It is more likely, however, that he regarded the\npsych\u00ea, which was the center of desires and emotions\nlocated in the heart and shared with animals, as a harmony of its own\nmaterial elements. This may have been drawn in with the first breath\nof the infant and from its seat in the heart it may have served as the\ncommand center which establishes the harmony of hot and cold which\nmakes the body ensouled. After the body loses its harmony and dies,\nthis command center soul survives to transmigrate into the hearts of\nother animals and men. If the psych\u00ea was the\ntransmigrating soul for Philolaus, it follows that he did not think\nthat humans were reborn as plants, since according to Fr. 13 plants do\nnot have a psych\u00ea. Moreover, it would only be the human\ncharacter as constituted by emotions and desires that transmigrates\nand not human intellect, since according to Fr. 13\npsych\u00ea does not include intellect (Huffman 2009; for a critique see Palmer 2018).\n",
