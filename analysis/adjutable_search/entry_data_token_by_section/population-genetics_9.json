    "main_text": "Random Drift || Coalescence\n4.1 Coalescence\n\nTraditional population genetics models of the sort sketched above are\n\u201cforward-looking\u201d, in that their goal is to predict the\nfuture genetic composition of a population, or the fate of an allele,\nbased on various assumptions about the evolutionary processes at work.\nStarting in the 1980s, a different approach to population genetics was\ndeveloped known as \u201ccoalescent theory\u201d, originally as a\nresult of work in applied probability (Kingman 1982). Coalescent\ntheory has a \u201cbackwards-looking\u201d orientation: it aims to\nmake inferences about a population\u2019s history based on a sample\nof genes drawn from the current population (Wakeley 2008). Compared to\nthe traditional forwards-looking models, coalescent theory allows a\ndifferent set of evolutionary questions to be asked, and also yields\nsimpler ways of calculating certain quantities of interest in the\ntraditional models, such as fixation probabilities (Rice 2004, ch. 5).\nAlso, coalescent theory yields predictions, for example about the\namount of DNA sequence variation we should expect to find in a sample\nof genes from a natural population, that can be directly tested\nagainst data.\n\nCoalescent theory is all about tracing lines of ancestry between genes\nin a (diploid) population. Ordinarily we think of ancestor-descendant\nlineages of organisms, but we can equally (indeed more easily) think\nin terms of lineages of genes at a locus, while simply ignoring the\norganisms that the genes are housed within. The starting point of\ncoalescent theory is the observation that all the genes at a locus in\na current population must ultimately stem from a single ancestral gene\ncopy in the past (the \u201cmost recent common ancestor\u201d or\nMRCA). This is in effect the flip-side of genetic drift. If we go back\nfar enough in a population\u2019s ancestry, we must arrive at a point\nat which all of the genes bar one have left no descendants in the\ncurrent population. This is because, at every round of reproduction, a\ngiven gene copy has a certain chance of not leaving any descendants in\nthe next generation, i.e., being eliminated by drift. This implies\nthat, as we trace back in time, the gene lineages will join up, or\n\u201ccoalesce\u201d.\n\nThe simplest approach to coalescence uses the Wright-Fisher model,\nexpounded above. Recall that this model involves a diploid population\nof fixed size \\(N\\), in which selection is absent, mating is random,\nand generations are non-overlapping. Each new generation is formed by\nrandomly sampling \\(2N\\) of the gametes produced by the previous\ngeneration. To illustrate coalescence, suppose that we pick two gene\ncopies at random from the current population. There are then two\npossibilities: either both derive from a single copy in the preceding\ngeneration, or they do not. These two events occur with probabilities\n\\(\\frac{1}{2N}\\) and \\((1 - \\frac{1}{2N})\\) respectively. To see this, note that\nthe first gene we pick must have some parent or other in the previous\ngeneration; so the probability that the two genes we pick derive from\na single copy in the previous generation is simply the probability\nthat the second gene has the same parent as the first; since there are\n\\(2N\\) possible parents, this equals \\(\\frac{1}{2N}\\). So the alternative\npossibility, that the two genes do not coalesce in the previous\ngeneration, has the complementary probability of \\((1 - \\frac{1}{2N})\\).\n\nThis reasoning can be repeated in a natural way. Suppose that the two\ngenes we pick do not coalesce in the immediately previous generation,\ni.e., they have different parents. Then, those two parents genes will\nthemselves either derive from a single copy in the previous\ngeneration, or they will not. If so, then the two genes we have picked\nwill coalesce two generations ago, i.e., derive from a single\ngrandparent gene. The probability of this is \\(\\frac{1}{2N} \\times (1 -\n\\frac{1}{2N})\\). By iterating this reasoning, we can work out the\nprobability distribution that two randomly chosen gene copies in the\ncurrent generation derive from a common ancestor t\ngenerations ago. This is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\textit{Prob}(\\text{coalescence}~t~\\text{generations ago}) = \\frac{1}{2N}\n\\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N}\\right)^{t-1}.\n\\]\n\n\nThe next question to ask is what the expected value of this\ndistribution is, that is, what the mean time to coalescence is? The\nanswer turns out to be approximately \\(2N\\). Thus on average, a\npair of randomly picked genes at a given locus will coalesce after\n\\(2N\\) generations, where \\(N\\) is population size. However,\nthere is considerable variability about this mean, meaning that there\nis a significant chance that coalescence will occur much quicker, or\nmuch slower, than this. By building on this simple analysis,\ncoalescent theory allows a range of more complicated questions to be\nanswered, involving, for example, multiple alleles, sub-divided\npopulations, populations that change in size over time, plus other\ndeviations from the assumptions of the basic Wright-Fisher model. For\nexample, coalescent theory yields a straightforward calculation of how\nmany generations back we must go, on average, to find the MRCA of a\nnumber of different genes at a locus (Otto and Day 2007, ch. 13).\n",
