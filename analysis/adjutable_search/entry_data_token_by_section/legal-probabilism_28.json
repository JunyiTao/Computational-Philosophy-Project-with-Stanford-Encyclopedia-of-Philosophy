    "main_text": "Further Objections\n7. Further Objections\n\nAside from the paradoxes of naked statistical evidence, the\nconjunction paradox is one of the most widely discussed objections\nagainst legal probabilism. This section examines this paradox together\nwith a few other objections. Many of these objections can be traced\nback to the seminal work of Cohen (1977) who also leveled criticisms\nagainst Bayesian epistemology more generally (for further discussion,\nsee Earman 1992; Bovens and Hartmann 2004; Bradley 2015 and the\nentry on\n Bayesian epistemology).\n",
