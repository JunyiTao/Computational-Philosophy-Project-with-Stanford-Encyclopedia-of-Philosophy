    "main_text": "Republican Liberty and The History of England || Macaulay\u2019s republicanism\n2.1 Macaulay\u2019s republicanism\n\nWhile it is clear that Macaulay was a supporter of some form of\n\u201crepublican\u201d liberty, it is less clear whether she was an\nout and out supporter of republicanism, in the constitutional sense,\naccording to which republicans are opposed to monarchy. In the context\nof James Boswell\u2019s visit to Corsica, and his subsequent support of the\nleader of the Corsican independence movement, General Paoli, Macaulay\noutlined a republican constitution for Corsica, in a letter to Paoli,\nwhich she published with her reflections on Hobbes (Macaulay 1767).\nShe does not seem to have thought that, in general, monarchical\ngovernments are incompatible with republican liberty, so long as the\nmonarch is constrained by a constitution, governed by law, and the\nliberty of the people is protected by parliament. She was not opposed\nto the mixed English constitution, but her design for a republic is\ninteresting for the principles on which she thought government should\nbe founded.\n\nMacaulay begins her letter to Paoli with a strong statement in favour\nof democracy,\n\n\nOf all the various models of republics, which have been exhibited for\nthe instruction of mankind, it is only the democratical system,\nrightly balanced, which can secure the virtue, liberty and happiness\nof society. (Macaulay 1767, 42)\n\n\nHer use of the phrase \u201cthe democratical system, rightly\nbalanced\u201d suggests the influence of James Harrington\u2019s The\nCommonwealth of Oceana on her thinking, and the Hills have\nsuggested that one might consider her an \u201caristocratic\nrepublican\u201d with similar views to Harrington (Hill and Hill\n1967, 398; Hill 1992, 177). This does not, however, sit well with her\ngeneral opposition to the inequalities of wealth and power consequent\non aristocracy, which we will see are at the heart of her opposition\nto Burke. She is serious when she claims that,\n\n\nThe very nature of slavish dependence and proud superiority are\nequally baneful to the virtues inherent in mankind: the first, by\nsedulous attention and mean adulation to please its master,\nundermines, and at last subdues the innate generous principles of the\nsoul; and the fond delights of superiority extinguish all the virtues\nwhich ennoble human nature, such as self-denial, general benevolence,\nand the exalted passion of sacrificing private views to public\nhappiness.\n\n\nAccording to Macaulay, inequality is one of the factors which\nmilitates against a populace being motivated to act in accordance with\nthe immutable moral truths. And, she will later call monarchy\nsupported by aristocracy \u201cthe very worst species of\ngovernment\u201d (Macaulay 1778, 311). A democratical system requires\nnot simply constitutional arrangements, but also mechanisms to ensure\nthat the populace are sufficiently virtuous so as not to be motivated\nto undermine those arrangements. This will lead to her later interest\nin education. But in the letter to Paoli she suggests only economic\nand procedural mechanisms in order to protect the democratic\nconstitution from dissolution.\n\nHer model for a democratic constitution is a bicameral government made\nup of a senate and a house of representatives. The relatively small\nsenate, of about fifty members, debates and proposes laws. The larger\nhouse of representatives, elected by the people, from the people, also\ndebates but does not propose, but rather rejects or accepts the\nproposals of the senate. The members of the senate are elected, by the\nrepresentatives, from among their number, for three-year terms, with\nno re-election within a three-year lapse of time. One third of the\nsenate is replaced yearly. Generals, admirals, magistrates and other\ncivil officers are to sit in the Senate and vote, but are elected by\nthe representatives to one-year terms from among those who have\nachieved senatorial rank. The two houses of Parliament are also to act\nas courts of appeal for the administration of justice. Two mechanisms\nare proposed to prevent the corruption of the constitution by the\naccumulation of power in individual hands: the strict rotation of\nfunctions, and the \u201cright balancing\u201d of wealth.\n\nMacaulay argues that it was the failure to guard against the growth of\ninequalities in wealth that led to the downfall of the Roman\nrepublics.\n\n\nHad the Agrarian been ever fixed on a proper balance, it must have\nprevented that extreme disproportion in the circumstances of her\ncitizens, which gave such weight of power to the aristocratical party,\nthat it enabled them to subvert the fundamental principles of the\ngovernment, and introduce those innovations which ended in anarchy.\nAnarchy produced its natural effect, viz. absolute monarchy (Macaulay\n1767, 35).\n\n\nThe right balancing of wealth is to be ensured by estates being\nequally divided among sons, and if there are none living, between the\nclosest male relatives. She suggests no female inheritance, and the\nabolition of dowries, though unmarried women are to be supported by\nannuities provided by their brothers (Macaulay 1767, 37). Since this\nappears to deprive women of any economic power, and presumably\nexcludes them from parliamentary representation, this feature of her\nproposals has been disappointing to feminists, and it has been claimed\nthat she was no defender of women\u2019s rights (Staves 1989). Her later\nworks show that she was nevertheless sympathetic to women\u2019s plight,\nand she might be excused, in a context in which women\u2019s power was\nclosely associated with luxury and aristocratic privilege, for\nsacrificing women\u2019s apparent interests for the sake of equality.\n",
