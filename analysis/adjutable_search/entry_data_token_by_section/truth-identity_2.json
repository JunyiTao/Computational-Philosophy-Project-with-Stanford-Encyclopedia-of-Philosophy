    "main_text": "Motivation\n3. Motivation\n\nWhat motivates the identity theory of truth? It can be viewed as a\nresponse to difficulties that seem to accrue to at least some versions\nof the correspondence theory (cf. Dodd 2008a: 120, 124). The\ncorrespondence theory of truth holds that truth consists in a relation\nof correspondence between something linguistic or quasi-linguistic, on\nthe one hand, and something worldly on the other. Generally, the items\non the worldly end of the relation are taken to be facts or\n(obtaining) states of affairs. For many purposes these two latter\nkinds of entity (facts, obtaining states of affairs) are assimilated\nto one another, and that strategy will be followed here. The exact\nnature of the correspondence theory will then depend on what the other\nrelatum is taken to be. The items mentioned so far make\navailable three distinct versions of the correspondence theory,\ndepending on whether this relatum is taken to consist of\ndeclarative sentences, Fregean thoughts, or Russellian propositions.\nModern correspondence theorists make a distinction between\ntruth-bearers, which would typically fall under one of these\nthree classifications, and\n truth-makers,[4]\n the worldly entities making truth-bearers true, when they are true.\nIf these latter entities are facts, then true declarative sentences,\nFregean thoughts, or Russellian propositions\u2014whichever of these\none selects as the relata of the correspondence relation on the\nlanguage side of the language\u2013world divide\u2014correspond to\nfacts in the sense that facts are what make those sentences, thoughts,\nor propositions true, when they are true. (Henceforth we shall\nnormally speak simply of thoughts and propositions, understanding\nthese to be Fregean thoughts and Russellian propositions respectively,\nunless otherwise specified.)\n\nThat, according to the correspondence theorist (and the identity\ntheorist can agree so far), immediately gives us a constraint on the\nshape of worldly facts. Take our sample sentence \u201cSocrates is\nwise\u201d, and recall that this sentence is here assumed to be true.\nAt the level of reference we encounter the object Socrates and\n(assuming realism about\n properties)[5]\n the property of wisdom. Both of these may be taken to be entities in\nthe world, but it is plausible that neither amounts to a fact: neither\namounts to a plausible truth-maker for the sentence \u201cSocrates is\nwise\u201d, or for its expressed thought, or for its expressed\nproposition. That is because the man Socrates, just as such, and the\nproperty of wisdom, just as such, are not, so the argument goes,\npropositionally structured, either jointly or severally, and so do not\namount to enough to make it true that Socrates is wise (cf. D.\nArmstrong 1997: 115\u201316; Dodd 2008a: 7; Hofweber 2016: 288). Even\nif we add in further universals, such as the relation of\ninstantiation, and indeed the instantiation of instantiation to any\ndegree, the basic point seems to be unaffected. In fact it can\nplausibly be maintained (although some commentators disagree; Merricks\n2007: ch. 1, passim, and pp. 82, 117, 168; Asay 2013:\n63\u20134; Jago 2018: passim, e.g., pp. 73, 84, 185, 218,\n250, though cf. p. 161) that the man Socrates, just as such, is not\neven competent to make it true that Socrates exists; for that we need\nthe existence of the man Socrates. Hence, it would appear\nthat, if there are to be truth-makers in the world, they will have to\nbe structured, syntactically or quasi-syntactically, in the same\ngeneral way as declarative sentences, thoughts, and propositions. For\nconvenience we can refer to structure in this general sense as\n\u201cpropositional structure\u201d: the point then is that neither\nSocrates, nor the property of wisdom, nor (if we want to adduce it)\nthe relation of instantiation is, just as such, propositionally\nstructured. Following this line of argument through, we reach the\nconclusion that nothing short of full-blown, propositionally\nstructured entities like the fact that Socrates is wise will\nbe competent to make the sentence \u201cSocrates is wise\u201d, or\nthe thought or proposition expressed by that sentence, true. (A\nquestion that arises here is whether tropes might be able to provide a\n\u201cthinner\u201d alternative to such ontologically\n\u201crich\u201d entities as the fact that Socrates is\nwise. One problem that seems to confront any such strategy is\nthat of making the proposed alternative a genuine one, that is, of\nconstruing the relevant tropes in such a way that they do not simply\ncollapse into, or ontologically depend on, entities of the relatively\nrich form that Socrates is wise. For discussion see Dodd\n2008a: 7\u20139.)\n\nThe question facing the correspondence theorist is now: if such\npropositionally structured entities are truth-makers, are they\ntruth-makers for sentences, thoughts, or propositions? It is at this\npoint that the identity theorist finds the correspondence theory\nunsatisfactory. Consider first the suggestion that the worldly fact\nthat Socrates is wise is the truth-maker for the\nreference-level proposition that Socrates is wise (see, e.g.,\nJago 2018: 72\u20133, and passim). There surely are such\nfacts as the fact that Socrates is wise: we talk about such\nthings all the time. The problem would seem to be not with the\nexistence of such facts, but rather with the relation of\ncorrespondence which is said by the version of the correspondence\ntheory that we are currently considering to obtain between the fact\nthat Socrates is wise and the proposition that Socrates\nis wise. As emerges from this way of expressing the difficulty,\nthere seems to be no linguistic difference between the way we talk\nabout propositions and the way we talk about facts, when these\nentities are specified by \u201cthat\u201d clauses. That suggests\nthat facts just are true propositions. If that is right, then\nthe relation between facts and true propositions is not one of\ncorrespondence\u2014which, as Frege famously observed (Frege\n1918\u201319: 60 [1977: 3]; cf. K\u00fcnne 2003: 8; Milne 2010:\n467\u20138), implies the distinctness of the\nrelata\u2014but identity.\n\nThis line of argument can be strengthened by noting the following\npoint about explanation. Correspondence theorists have typically\nwanted the relation of correspondence to explain truth: they\nhave usually wanted to say that it is because the proposition\nthat Socrates is wise corresponds to a fact that it is true,\nand because the proposition that Socrates is\nfoolish\u2014or rather: It is not the case that Socrates is\nwise (after all, his merely being foolish is not enough to\nguarantee that he is not wise, for he might, like James I and VI, be\nboth wise and foolish)\u2014does not correspond to a fact that it is\nfalse. But the distance between the true proposition that Socrates\nis wise and the fact that Socrates is wise seems to be\ntoo small to provide for explanatory leverage. Indeed the identity\ntheorist\u2019s claim is that there is no distance at all. Suppose we\nask: Why is the proposition that Socrates is wise true? If we\nreply by saying that it is true because it is a fact that Socrates\nis wise, we seem to have explained nothing, but merely repeated\nourselves (cf. Strawson 1971: 197; Anscombe 2000: 8; Rasmussen 2014:\n39\u201343). So correspondence apparently gives way to identity as\nthe relation which must hold or fail to hold between a proposition and\na state of affairs if the proposition is to be true or false: the\nproposition is true just if it is identical with an obtaining state of\naffairs and false if it is not (cf. Horwich 1998: 106). And it would\nseem that, if the identity theorist is right about this disposition,\nexplanatory pretensions will have to be abandoned: for while it will\nbe correct to say that a proposition is true just if it is identical\nwith a fact, false otherwise, it is hard to see that much of substance\nhas thereby been said about truth (cf. Hornsby 1997; 2; Dodd 2008a;\n135).\n\nIt might be replied here that there are circumstances in which we\ntolerate statements of the form \u201cA because\nB\u201d when an appropriate identity\u2014perhaps even\nidentity of sense, or reference, or both\u2014obtains between\n\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d. For example, we say\nthings like \u201cHe is your first cousin because he is a child of a\nsibling of one of your parents\u201d (K\u00fcnne 2003: 155). But here\nit is plausible that there is a definitional connection between\nleft-hand side and right-hand side, which seems not to hold of \n\n\nThe proposition that Socrates is wise is true because it is a\nfact that Socrates is wise. \n\n\nIn the latter case there is surely no question of definition; rather,\nwe are supposed, according to the correspondence theorist, to have an\nexample of metaphysical explanation, and that is just what, according\nto the identity theorist, we do not have. After all, the identity\ntheorist will insist, it seems obvious that the relation, whatever it\nis, between the proposition that Socrates is wise and the\nfact that Socrates is wise must, given that the proposition\nis true, be an extremely close one: what could this relation be? If\nthe identity theorist is right that the relation cannot be one of\nmetaphysical explanation (in either direction), then it looks as\nthough it will be hard to resist the insinuation of the linguistic\ndata that the relation is one of identity.\n\nIt is for this reason that identity theorists sometimes insist that\ntheir position should not be defined in terms of an identity between\ntruth-bearer and truth-maker: that way of expressing the theory looks\ntoo much in thrall to correspondence theorists\u2019 talk (cf.\nCandlish 1999b: 200\u20131, 213). For the identity theorist, to speak\nof both truth-makers and truth-bearers would imply that the things\nallegedly doing the truth-making were distinct from the things that\nwere made true. But, since in the identity theorist\u2019s view there\nare no truth-makers distinct from truth-bearers, if the latter are\nconceived as propositions, and since nothing can make itself true, it\nfollows that there are no truth-makers simpliciter, only\ntruth-bearers. It seems to follow, too, that it would be ill-advised\nto attack the identity theory by pointing out that some (or all)\ntruths lack truth-makers (so Merricks 2007: 181): so long as truths\nare taken to be propositions, that is exactly what identity theorists\nthemselves say. From the identity theorist\u2019s point of view,\ntruth-maker theory looks very much like an exercise in splitting the\nlevel of reference in half and then finding a bogus match between the\ntwo halves (see McDowell 1998: 137 n. 21; Gaskin 2006: 203; 2008:\n119\u201327). For example, when David Armstrong remarks that \n\n\nWhat is needed is something in the world which ensures that a\nis F, some truth-maker or ontological ground for\na\u2019s being F. What can this be except the state of\naffairs of a\u2019s being F? (1991: 190) \n\n\nthe identity theorist is likely to retort that a\u2019s being\nF, which according to Armstrong \u201censures\u201d that\na is F,just is the entity (whatever it is)\nthat a is F. The identity theorist maps conceptual\nconnections that we draw between the notions of proposition, truth,\nfalsity, state of affairs, and fact. These connections look trivial,\nwhen spelt out\u2014of course, an identity theorist will counter that\nto go further would be to fall into error\u2014so that to speak of an\nidentity theory can readily appear too grand (McDowell 2005:\n83; 2007: 352. But cf. David 2002: 126). So much for the thesis that\nfacts are truth-makers and propositions truth-bearers; an\nexactly parallel argument applies to the version of the correspondence\ntheory that treats facts as truth-makers and thoughts as\ntruth-bearers.\n\nConsider now the suggestion that obtaining states of affairs, as the\ncorrespondence theorist conceives them, make declarative\nsentences (as opposed to propositions) true (cf. Horwich 1998:\n106\u20137). In this case there appears to be no threat of triviality\nof the sort that apparently plagued the previous version of the\ncorrespondence theory, because states of affairs like that\nSocrates is wise are genuinely distinct from linguistic items\nsuch as the sentence \u201cSocrates is wise\u201d. To that extent\nfriends of the identity theory need not jib at the suggestion that\nsuch sentences have worldly truth-makers, if that is how the relation\nof correspondence is being glossed. But they might question the\nappropriateness of the gloss. For, they might point out, it does not\nseem possible, without falsification, to draw detailed links between\nsentences and bits of the world. After all, different sentences in the\nsame or different languages can \u201ccorrespond\u201d to the same\nbit of the world, and these different sentences might have very\ndifferent (numbers of) components. The English sentence \u201cThere\nare cows\u201d contains three words: are there then three bits in the\nworld corresponding to this sentence, and making it true? (cf. Neale\n2001: 177). The sentence \u201cCows\nexist\u201d contains only two words, but would not the correspondence\ntheorist want to say that it was made true by the same chunk of\nreality? And when we take other languages into account, there seems in\nprinciple to be no reason to privilege any particular number and say\nthat a sentence corresponding to the relevant segment of reality must\ncontain that number of words: why might there not, in\nprinciple, be sentences of actual or possible languages such that, for\nany n \u2265 1, there existed a sentence comprising n\nwords and meaning the same as the English \u201cThere are\ncows\u201d? (In fact, is English not already such a language? Just\nprefix and then iterate ad lib. a vacuous operator like\n\u201cReally\u201d.)\n\nIn a nutshell, then, the identity theorist\u2019s case against the\ncorrespondence theory is that, when the truth-making relation is\nconceived as originating in a worldly fact (or similar) and having as\nits other relatum a true sentence, the claim that this\nrelation is one of correspondence cannot be made out; if, on the other\nhand, the relevant relation targets a proposition (or\nthought), then that relation must be held to be one of identity, not\ncorrespondence.\n",
