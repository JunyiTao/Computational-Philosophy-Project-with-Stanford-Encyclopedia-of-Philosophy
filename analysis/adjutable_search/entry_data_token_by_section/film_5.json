Film and Society\n\n\nThe best way to understand the innovations made by philosophers in our\nunderstanding of how films relate to society is to look at the view\nthat was dominant in film theory some years ago. According to that\nview, popular narrative films\u2014especially those produced by\n\u201cHollywood,\u201d a term that referred to the entertainment\nindustry located in Hollywood, California, but also included popular\nnarrative films produced on a similar model\u2014inevitably\nsupported social oppression by denying, in one way or another, its\nexistence. Such films were taken to present nothing but fairytales\nthat used the realistic character of the medium to present those\nimaginary stories as if they were accurate pictures of reality. In\nthis way, the actual character of the social domination assumed by\nsuch a view to be rampant in contemporary society was obscured in\nfavor of a rosy picture of the realities of human social\nexistence.\n\n\nAs part of their argument, these film theorists have gone beyond\nexamining individual films themselves and have argued that the very\nstructure of the narrative film functions to assist in the maintenance\nof social domination. From this point of view, an overcoming of\nnarrativity itself is required for films to be genuinely\nprogressive.\n\n\nIn opposition to such a negative view of film's relationship to\nsociety, philosophers of film have argued that popular films need not\nsupport social domination but can even give expression to socially\ncritical attitudes. In making this argument, they have corrected film\ntheory's tendency to make broad generalizations about the relationship\nbetween film and society that are not grounded in careful analysis of\nindividual films. They have instead concentrated upon presenting detailed\ninterpretations of films that show how their narratives present\ncritical takes on various social practices and institutions. Class,\nrace, gender, and sexuality are among the different social arenas in\nwhich philosophers of film have seen films make socially conscious,\ncritical interventions in public debates.\n\n\nOne interesting example of films that develop political stances that\nare not merely supportive of existing modes of social domination are\nthose that involve interracial couples. So Stanley Kramer's 1967 film,\nGuess Who's Coming to Dinner, investigates the plausibility\nof racial integration as a solution to the problems of anti-black\nracism in America through its portrayal of the problems facing an\ninterracial couple. Nearly 25 years later, Spike Lee's Jungle\nFever argues against the earlier film's political agenda, once\nagain using an interracial couple that encounters racism. Only this\ntime, the film asserts that the intransigent racism of White Americans\nundermines integration as a panacea to the ills of this racist society\n(Wartenberg 1999). And many other films employ this narrative figure\nto investigate other aspects of racism and possibilities for its\novercoming.\n\n\nSimilarly, philosophers have looked outside of Hollywood to the films\nof progressive filmmakers like John Sayles to illustrate their belief\nthat narrative films can make sophisticated political statements. A\nfilm like Matewan is shown to involve a sophisticated\ninvestigation of the relationship between class and race as sites of\nsocial domination.\n\n\nIn general, then, we can say that philosophers have resisted a\nmonolithic condemnation of films as socially regressive and explored\nthe different means that filmmakers have used to present critical\nperspectives on areas of social concern. While they have not ignored\nthe ways in which standard Hollywood narratives undermine critical\nsocial awareness, they have shown that narrative film is an important\nvehicle for communal reflection on important social issues of the\nday.\n",
