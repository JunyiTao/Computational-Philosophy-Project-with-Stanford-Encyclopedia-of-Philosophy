    "main_text": "1847\u2014The Beginnings of the Modern Versions of the Algebra of Logic\n2. 1847\u2014The Beginnings of the Modern Versions of the Algebra of Logic\n\nIn late 1847, Boole and Augustus De Morgan (1806\u20131871) each\npublished a book on logic\u2014Boole\u2019s Mathematical Analysis of\nLogic (1847) and De Morgan\u2019s Formal Logic (1847). De\nMorgan\u2019s approach was to dissect every aspect of traditional deductive\nlogic (usually called \u2018Aristotelian logic\u2019) into its\nminutest components, to consider ways to generalize these components,\nand then, in some cases, undertake to build a logical system using\nthese components. Unfortunately, he was never able to incorporate his\nbest ideas into a significant system. His omission of a symbol for\nequality made it impossible to develop an equational algebra of logic.\nIt seems that synthesis was not De Morgan\u2019s strong suit.\n\nDe Morgan\u2019s book of 1847 was part of a revival in logic studies that\noriginated at the beginning of 19th Century with Joseph Diez Gergonne\n(1771\u20131859) in France, and Bernhard Bolzano (1781\u20131848) in\nBohemia, among others. George Bentham and William Hamilton in the\nUnited Kingdom were also part of this revival and their studies\nfocused on the nature of variations of the categorical sentences in\ntraditional syllogistic, including what was called\n\u201cquantification of the predicate\u201d; for example, \u201cAll\n\\(A\\) are some \\(B\\)\u201d or \u201cSome \\(A\\) are all\n\\(B\\)\u201d. It was thought that this problem required an extension\nof the syllogistic logic of Aristotle and that some form of symbolic\nmethod was needed both to handle such statements and provide a\nclassification of their different types (see Heinemann 2015 chapters 2\nand 3). \n\nBoole approached logic from a completely different perspective, namely\nhow to cast Aristotelian logic in the garb of symbolical algebra.\nUsing symbolical algebra was a theme with which he was well-acquainted\nfrom his work in differential equations, and from the various papers\nof his young friend and mentor Duncan Farquharson Gregory\n(1813\u20131844), who made attempts to cast other subjects such as\ngeometry into the language of symbolical algebra. Since the\napplication of symbolical algebra to differential equations had\nproceeded through the introduction of differential operators, it must\nhave been natural for Boole to look for operators that applied in the\narea of Aristotelian logic. He readily came up with the idea of using\n\u201cselection\u201d operators, for example, a selection operator\nfor the color red would select the red members from a class. In his\n1854 book, Boole realized that it was simpler to omit selection\noperators and work directly with classes. (However he kept the\nselection operators to justify his claim that his laws of logic were\nnot ultimately based on observations concerning the use of language,\nbut were actually deeply rooted in the processes of the human mind.)\nFrom now on in this article, when discussing Boole\u2019s 1847 book, the\nselection operators have been replaced with the simpler direct\nformulation using classes.\n\nSince symbolical algebra was just the syntactic side of ordinary\nalgebra, Boole needed ways to interpret the usual operations and\nconstants of algebra to create his algebra of logic for classes.\nMultiplication was interpreted as intersection, leading to his one new\nlaw, the idempotent law \\(XX = X\\) for multiplication, rediscovering a\nlogical law already formulated by Leibniz. Addition was defined as\nunion, provided one was dealing with disjoint classes; and\nsubtraction as class difference, provided one was subtracting a\nsubclass from a class. In other cases, the addition and subtraction\noperations were simply undefined, or as Boole wrote,\nuninterpretable. The usual laws of arithmetic told Boole that\n1 must be the universe and \\(1 - X\\) must be the complement of\n\\(X\\).\n\nThe next step in Boole\u2019s system was to translate the four kinds of\ncategorical propositions into equations, for example \u201cAll \\(X\\)\nis \\(Y\\)\u201d becomes \\(X = XY\\), and \u201cSome \\(X\\) is\n\\(Y\\)\u201d becomes \\(V = XY\\), where \\(V\\) is a new symbol. To\neliminate the middle term in a syllogism Boole borrowed an elimination\ntheorem from ordinary algebra, but it was too weak for his algebra of\nlogic. This would be remedied in his 1854 book. Boole found that he\ncould not always derive the desired conclusions with the above\ntranslation of particular propositions (i.e., those with existential\nimport), so he added the variants \\(X = VY\\), \\(Y = VX\\), and \\(VX =\nVY\\) (see the entry on\n Boole).\n\nThe symbolic algebra of the 1800s included much more than just the\nalgebra of polynomials, and Boole experimented to see which results\nand tools might apply to the algebra of logic. For example, he proved\none of his results by using an infinite series expansion. His\nfascination with the possibilities of ordinary algebra led him to\nconsider questions such as: What would logic be like if the idempotent\nlaw were replaced by the law \\(X^3 = X\\)? His successors, especially\nJevons, would soon narrow the operations on classes to the ones that\nwe use today, namely union, intersection and complement.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, three-quarters of the way through his brief book\nof 1847, after finishing derivations of the traditional Aristotelian\nsyllogisms in his system, Boole announced that his algebra of logic\nwas capable of far more general applications. Then he proceeded to add\ngeneral theorems on developing (expanding) terms, providing\ninterpretations of equations, and using long division to express one\nclass in an equation in terms of the other classes (with side\nconditions added).\n\nBoole\u2019s theorems, completed and perfected in 1854, gave algorithms for\nanalyzing infinitely many argument forms. This opened a new and\nfruitful perspective, deviating from the traditional approach to\nlogic, where for centuries scholars had struggled to come up with\nclever mnemonics to memorize a very small catalog of valid conversions\nand syllogisms and their various interrelations.\n\nDe Morgan\u2019s Formal Logic did not gain significant\nrecognition, primarily because it was a large collection of small\nfacts without a significant synthesis. Boole\u2019s The Mathematical\nAnalysis of Logic had powerful methods that caught the attention\nof a few scholars such as De Morgan and Arthur Cayley\n(1821\u20131895); but immediately there were serious questions about\nthe workings of Boole\u2019s algebra of logic: Just how closely was it tied\nto ordinary algebra? How could Boole justify the procedures of his\nalgebra of logic? In retrospect it seems quite certain that Boole did\nnot know why his system worked. His claim, following Gregory, that in\norder to justify using ordinary algebra it was enough to check the\ncommutative law \\(XY = YX\\) for multiplication and the distributive\nlaw \\(X(Y + Z) = XY + XZ\\), is clearly false. Nonetheless it is also\nlikely that he had checked his results in a sufficient number of cases\nto give substance to his belief that his system was correct.\n",
