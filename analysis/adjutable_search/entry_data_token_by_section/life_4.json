    "main_text": "Origin(s) of Life\n4. Origin(s) of Life\n\n\nInextricable from the question of life\u2019s nature is the\nquestion of its origin. Ancient and modern thinkers accepted that life\noften arose spontaneously from non-life. Two centuries of experiments\neventually overturned this widely accepted view, culminating in Louis\nPasteur\u2019s swan-neck bottle experiments. Since then, the puzzle of\nLife\u2019s origin has been one of the biggest and most important in\nall of science.\nDarwin was famously silent about the problem, although in a letter\nto his friend Joseph Hooker, Darwin confided that he imagined life\noriginating in \u201csome warm little pond\u201d (see \nOther Internet Resources below; and  Peret\u00f3 et al. 2009).\nSubsequent work on the subject was sparse until the 1920s when\nAlexander Oparin and J.B.S. Haldane independently proposed hypotheses\nfor life\u2019s origin in then plausible early Earth conditions\n(Haldane 1929; Oparin 2010/1936). As a graduate student in the 1950s,\nStanley Miller tested the proposal, discovering dozens of amino acids\nin the mixture (1953). Since then, the field of origins-of-life studies\nhas expanded dramatically.\nOur earliest reliable records of this planet, some 3.5 billion years\nago, contain distinctive evidence of microbial fossils, including\ndistinctive shapes that correlate to the sizes and shapes of current\nprokaryotes, as well as carbon-ratios distinctive to life as we know it\n(Schopf 1993, Schopf et al. 2017). Many analyses have pushed our\nconfidence in life\u2019s earlier origin significantly further back,\nsuggesting that basically as soon as Earth was not molten, it was\nfilled with life (Pearce et al. 2018, Lineweaver 2020). How life\nstarted and why it started so quickly remains one of the most pressing\nopen questions in science.\nThere are many open philosophical issues in origins of life\nresearch. Several of these are centered around the explanandum in\nquestion and epistemological limits to our knowledge. Researchers\ndiffer, for example, as to whether the purpose of origins-of-life\nresearch is to discover how life could have originated or how it did\noriginate (Scharf et al. 2015, Mariscal et al. 2019). Some steps in the\nprocess could have been chancy, others could have been deterministic\nbut highly contingent, still others could have been the only way life\never originates anywhere in the Universe.\nThere are several broad approaches to investigating the origin of\nlife. \u201cBottom-Up\u201d approaches begin with pre-biotic chemistry and explore how it could withstand stressors in order\nfor lifelike entities to form and evolve. At present, there are many\nunsolved problems, most notably that most energetically favorable interactions would\nconsume the proto-life forms involved. Scientists have cleverly\nattempted to ease the problem by relaxing assumptions: perhaps the\nenvironment provided our first boundaries (Koonin 2009), or perhaps it\nprovided porto-genetic material (Mathis et al. 2017), all of this could\nhave occurred in a viscous solvent instead of a cell (He et al. 2017),\nor on a surface (W\u00e4chtersh\u00e4user 1988), or using a variety of\nentities that eventually became encapsulated (Eigen & Schuster\n1977). Nevertheless, the gulf between the pre-biotic chemistry and the\nsimplest life forms is still huge and any number of explanations only\naccount for a tiny portion of the conceptual distance.\nAnother approach, \u201cTop-Down,\u201d uses current taxa to infer\nthe nature and timing of the origin of life on Earth. To do so, we take\ncurrent examples of life on Earth and trace their ancestry, by\ncomparing the nearly hundred shared genes, primarily associated with\nbiological translation (Koonin 2011). All life shares a last universal\ncommon ancestor, \u201cLUCA\u201d for short. There may have been\nseveral origins of life, but our evidence is insufficient to\ndistinguish this scenario from a single origin. Nevertheless, at least\none origin, presumably in Earthly pre-biotic conditions, led to the\nexistence of LUCA, an important constraint upon theorizing about the\norigin of life. It is widely expected that LUCA was merely one creature\nin a larger population and existed long after the origin of the first\norganism. There are also a variety of concerns with respect to LUCA:\nwhether it was simple or complex (Mariscal & Doolittle 2015);\nwhether it had a membrane that resembled any of the current membranes\n(Koonin 2011); whether the genes it contained were ancestors of our own\ngenes or subsequently acquired (Doolittle & Brown 1994, Woese &\nFox 1977; Woese 1998); whether its genome was made of DNA (Forterre\n2006a), whether it was a heterotroph or autotroph; where it lived; and\nwhen it lived.\nThe gap between Top-Down and Bottom-Up approaches is huge: untold\ngenerations passed between pre-biotic chemistry and LUCA. We may never\nbe able to solve Life\u2019s origin, but each step brings us closer to\nunderstanding the trajectory.\n",
