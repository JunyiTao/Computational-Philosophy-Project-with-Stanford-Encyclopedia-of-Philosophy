    "main_text": "The Philosophical Works and Thoughts of Umar Khayyam\n2. The Philosophical Works and Thoughts of Umar Khayyam\nKhayyam wrote little, but his works\u2014some fourteen treatises identified to date\u2014were remarkable. They can be categorized primarily in three genres: mathematics, philosophy, and poetry. His philosophical works which have been edited and published recently are (we have not translated ris\u0101lah (treatise) in the titles):\n\n[Lucid Discourse] \u201cA Translation of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s (Avicenna\u2019s) Lucid Discourse\u201d (Khutbah al-gharr\u0101\u2019).\n[On Being and Obligation] \u201cOn Being and Obligation\u201d (Ris\u0101lah f\u012b\u2019l-kawn wa\u2019l-takl\u012bf).\n[The Necessity of Contrariety] \u201cThe Response to Three Problems: The Necessity of Contrariety in the World, Predeterminism and Persistence\u201d (Al-jaw\u0101b \u2018an thal\u0101th mas\u0101\u2019il: D\u0323ar\u016brat al-tad\u0323\u0101d fi\u2019l-\u02bf\u0101lam wa\u2019l-jabr wa\u2019l-baq\u0101\u2019).\n[The Light of the Intellect] \u201cThe Light of the Intellect on the Subject of Universal Knowledge\u201d (Ris\u0101lah al-d\u0323iy\u0101\u2019 al-\u2018aql\u012b f\u012b mawd\u0323\u016b\u2018 al-\u2018ilm al-kull\u012b).\n[Principles of Existence] \u201cOn the Knowledge of the Universal Principles of Existence\u201d (Ris\u0101lah dar \u2018ilm kulliy\u0101t-i wuj\u016bd).\n[On Existence] \u201cOn Existence\u201d (Ris\u0101lah fi\u2019l-wuj\u016bd).\n[A Response] \u201cA Response to Three Problems\u201d (Ris\u0101lah jaw\u0101ban l\u012b thal\u0101th mas\u0101\u2019il). (3 and 7 are distinct works.)\n\nExcept the first work mentioned above which is a free translation and commentary on a discourse by Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, the other six philosophical treatises represent Khayyam\u2019s own independent philosophical views. It is noteworthy that Khayyam\u2019s philosophical treatises were written in the Peripatetic tradition at a time when philosophy in general and rationalism in particular were under attack by orthodox Muslim jurists\u2014so much that Khayyam had to defend himself against the charge of \u201cbeing a philosopher.\u201d\n\n\u201cA philosopher I am,\u201d my enemies falsely say,\nBut God knows I am not what they say;\nWhile in this sorrow-laden nook, I reside\nNeed to know who I am, and why Here stay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (translation by Aminrazavi)\n\nKhayyam identifies the main types of inquiry in \u201cphilosophy\u201d along the Peripatetic line: \u201cThe essential and real inquiries that are discussed in philosophy are three inquiries, [first], \u2018is it?\u2019\u2026second, \u2018what is it?\u2019\u2026third, \u2018why is it?\u2019\u201d (On Being and Obligation, Malik (ed.) 1998, 335). While these are standard Aristotelian questions, for Khayyam they have a wider range of philosophical implications, especially with regard to the following topics:\n\nThe existence of God, His attributes and knowledge\nHierarchy of Existents and the problem of multiplicity\nEschatology\nTheodicy\nPredeterminism and free will\nSubjects and predicates\nExistence and essence\n\n",
