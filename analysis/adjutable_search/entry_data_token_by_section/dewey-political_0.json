Situating Dewey\u2019s Political Philosophy\n\nFrom a very early point of his intellectual development, Dewey, like\nthe British idealist T. H. Green (on whom he wrote several essays),\naccepted that traditional liberalism in part rested on a false\nconception of the individual, which was ethically pernicious in its\neffect on liberal thought. Accordingly, many of the themes that\ncharacterised Dewey\u2019s thinking about social and political theory\nafter his turn to \u201cexperimentalism\u201d were present in his\nearlier, overtly idealist political philosophy. In texts such as\n\u201cThe Ethics of Democracy\u201d (EW1) and\n\u201cChristianity and Democracy\u201d (EW4), Dewey\nelaborates a version of the idealist criticisms of classical liberal\nindividualism. For this line of criticism, classical liberalism\nenvisages the individual as an independent entity in competition with\nother individuals, and takes social and political life as a sphere in\nwhich this competitive pursuit of self-interest is coordinated. By\ncontrast, the idealists rejected this view of social and political\nlife as the aggregation of inherently conflicting private interests.\nInstead, they sought to view individuals relationally: individuality\ncould be sustained only where social life was understood as an\norganism in which the well-being of each part was tied to the\nwell-being of the whole. Freedom in a positive sense consisted not\nmerely in the absence of external constraints but the positive fact of\nparticipation in such an ethically desirable social order. On this\nfoundation, Dewey rebuts Henry Maine\u2019s bleak assessment in\nPopular Government that democracy is the rule of the ignorant\nmajority. While it is important that voters can reject their rulers\nand so control them to some extent, democracy is not simply a form of\ngovernment defined by the distribution of the franchise or majority\nrule. Rather what matters, as Dewey puts it, is the way that the\nmajority is formed. To understand that requires grasping what Maine\nmisses, in Dewey\u2019s view: that \u201cmen are not isolated\nnon-social atoms, but are men only when in intrinsic relations\u201d\nto one another, and the state in turn only represents them \u201cso\nfar as they have become organically related to one another, or are\npossessed of unity of purpose and interest\u201d (\u201cThe Ethics\nof Democracy\u201d, EW1, 231\u20132). Democracy is a form of\nmoral and spiritual association that recognizes the contribution that\neach member can make in his or her particular way to this ethical\ncommunity. And each of us can contribute to this community since we\neach only become the individuals we are through our engagement in the\ninstitutions and practices of our society.\n\nOther important themes also appear in these early statements. Dewey is\nanti-elitist, and argues that the capacity of the wise few to discern\nthe public interest tends to be distorted by their position.\nDemocratic participation is not only viewed as a bulwark against\ngovernment by elites, but also as an aspect of individual freedom\n\u2013 humanity cannot rest content with a good \u201cprocured from\nwithout\u201d. Democracy is not \u201csimply and solely a form of\ngovernment\u201d, but a social and personal ideal; in other words, it\nis not only a property of political institutions but of a wide range\nof social relationships. This ideal is common to a range of social\nspheres, and should take \u201cindustrial, as well as civil and\npolitical\u201d forms (\u201cThe Ethics of Democracy\u201d,\nEW1, 246). It also has a religious dimension. Through\ndemocracy in this expansive and ideal sense,\n\nthe incarnation of God in man \u2026 becomes a living, present thing\n\u2026 The truth is brought down to life, its segregation removed;\nit is made a common trust enacted in all departments of action, not in\none isolated sphere called religious. (\u201cChristianity and\nDemocracy\u201d, EW4, 9)\n\n\nWhile the Christian conception of democracy recedes (but does not\nentirely disappear) in Dewey\u2019s later work, the idea that\ndemocracy should be viewed as a form of relationship that encompasses\nand unifies different spheres of social life remains important.\nDewey\u2019s later work is more questioning of the traditional\nethical standards and ideals that he appeals to in an essay like\n\u201cThe Ethics of Democracy\u201d. He is also sharply critical of\nwhat he sees as the residual Kantianism in Green\u2019s ethics of\nself-realization, although the general orientation remains:\nindividuals are not presocial atoms, and democracy in an ideal sense\nis a primarily social and ethical ideal rather than a method of\nmajority rule through voting.\n\nThree features of Dewey\u2019s wider conception of knowledge and\nvalue as he develops them in his later work are particularly important\nfor his political thinking: anti-absolutism, experimentalism, and\nnaturalism. The first strand of Dewey\u2019s philosophy is his\nscepticism about what he calls an \u201cabsolutistic\u201d\nconception of social and political philosophy. Dewey gathers some\ndifferent ideas under this heading but at its core it is the belief\nthat there are certain ahistorical and foundational features of the\nsocial world and that social and political philosophy should consist\nin identifying these features and using them to diagnose and evaluate\nsocial and political problems. This anti-absolutism is expressed in\nvarious ways by Dewey. In one version of this idea is the argument\nthat \u201cthe logic of general notions\u201d provides an idealised\npicture of agents and institutions that is too abstract to contribute\nto the kind of experimental inquiry that Dewey thinks we need in\nsocial thought (Reconstruction in Philosophy, MW12,\n187). For example:\n\nWe want to know about the worth of the institution of private property\nas it operates under given conditions of definite time and place. We\nmeet with the reply of Proudhon that property generally is theft, or\nwith that of Hegel that the realization of will is the end of all\ninstitutions, and that private ownership as the expression of mastery\nof personality over physical nature is a necessary element in such\nrealization \u2026. They are general answers supposed to have a universal\nmeaning that covers and dominates all particulars. Hence they do not\nassist in inquiry. They close it. They are not instrumentalities to be\nemployed and tested in clarifying concrete social difficulties. They\nare ready-made principles to be imposed upon particulars in order to\ndetermine their nature. (Reconstruction in Philosophy,\nMW12, 188)\n\n\nDewey diagnoses the same defect of absolutism in the more\n\u201cprofessedly empirical\u201d social theory of J. S. Mill\n(1843), for whom certain \u201csocial laws, normative and regulative,\nat all periods and under all circumstances of proper social life were\nassumed to exist\u201d (Public and Its Problems,\nLW2, 357). On this view, society is an aggregate of\nindividual human minds and the purpose of social science is to derive\nthe laws governing these aggregates. Dewey argues that this ignores\nthe extent to which the content of individual beliefs, desires and\npurposes are given by the social context in which individuals live and\nselves are socially constituted: the individual should not be\n\u201cregarded as something given, something already\nthere\u201d \u2013 social institutions are \u201cmeans for\ncreating individuals\u201d (Reconstruction in\nPhilosophy, MW12, 190, 192). Mill\u2019s individualism\nexemplifies what he describes as \u201cthe most pervasive fallacy of\nphilosophical thinking\u201d (\u201cContext and Thought\u201d,\nLW5, 5). This is the tendency to divide up experienced\nphenomena, and to take the distinct analysed elements to be separate\nexistences, independent both of the analysis and of each other. That\nthis abstraction is in particular circumstances essential for inquiry\nis an important theme in Dewey\u2019s philosophy. But this\nabstraction goes wrong \u201cwhenever the distinctions or elements\nthat are discriminated are treated as if they were final and\nself-sufficient\u201d (\u201cContext and Thought\u201d,\nLW5, 7), as when classical liberalism treats the individuals\nas \u201csomething given\u201d, ontologically prior to the\nsocial groups of which they are members. His anti-absolutist point,\nhowever, is not to claim the universal explanatory primacy of the\nsocial (a position associated with Hegel and the idealism of Green and\nF. H. Bradley that he had come to reject) or to object to the idea\nthat the individuals can be abstracted from their social context for\ncertain analytical purposes but with the idea that this abstracted\nindividual provides the firm foundation for a fixed and ahistorical\nexplanatory framework for social theory.\n\nA second sort of absolutism that Dewey rejects is the idea that there\nis a fixed and ahistorical standard of social evaluation using\ncritical standards derived from \u201cconsideration of the ultimate\nnature of things \u2013 God, the Universe, Man, Reason\u201d\n(Syllabus Social Institutions and the Study of Morals, MW15,\n233). The group of philosophers guilty of this kind of\nabsolutism includes Plato, Augustine, Aquinas, Spinoza and Hegel.\nHe also diagnoses this absolutism in philosophers who define the good\nwith reference to the psychology of personal and private\nconsciousness, encompassing not only hedonistic versions of\nutilitarianism but also theories of personal conscience associated\nwith Protestantism. These standards gain \u201coutside\nleverage\u201d only by being \u201cabsolutistic and non-historical,\nand, in effect, partisan, since they choose their outside standard to\nserve the purpose they have in mind, and there is no objective check\nupon their choice\u201d. Dewey develops a kind of ideological\ncriticism of traditional philosophy as prone to mistaking contingent\n(and convenient) social products for unchangeable features of human\nnature. Famously, for example, he thinks that the philosophical\npreference for \u201cintrinsic\u201d goods of contemplation and\nrelated values such as aesthetic purity originally reflect a form of\nGreek society structured around a slave class and a leisured class but\nis reproduced (with increasing difficulty) in other class-divided\nsocieties. Instead, what Dewey says that social criticism should be\ngoverned by what he calls \u201can immanent standard\u201d:\n\u201cthis is relative to phenomena but at the same time it is\nexperimental and hence it is checked up by social processes similar to\nthose which suggest it\u201d (Syllabus Social Institutions and\nthe Study of Morals, MW15, 234). This is not an appeal to a\nconventionalist or relativist idea that the standards for judging a\npractice are whatever happens to be prevalent or identifiable in a\ncommunity since, unless we define social groups in a moralistic way,\nthese can include groups \u201cbanded together in a criminal\nconspiracy, business aggregations that prey upon the public while\nserving it, political machines held together by the interests of\nplunder\u201c (Democracy and Education, MW9, 88):\nso not just any set of standards is valuable. Dewey\u2019s\nexperimentalism and his naturalism each form parts of his alternative\nto this conventionalist interpretation of immanent standards.\n\nThe experimentalist conception of what he calls intelligence or\ninquiry as problem-solving is intended as an account of human\nepistemic practices. We don\u2019t chase the impossible goal of\ncertainty, he thinks, and there are no epistemological foundations\navailable to guarantee that we have achieved it. The goal of an\ninquiry is not to arrive at a certain picture of the nature of things,\nbut to come up with what is an inevitably provisional solution to the\npractical and intellectual problem that sparked it. Inquiry has\nreached its apogee in the successes of modern science, medicine, and\nengineering but is continuous with, and arises from, mundane processes\nof inquiry and problem-solving or, as he put it in a text for\neducationalists, with How We Think (MW6,\nLW8). Inquiry should be understood as part of our struggle\nwith an objectively precarious but improvable environment. Inquiry is\ndemanded by what he calls an \u201cincomplete\u201d or\n\u201cproblematic\u201d situation, that is, one in which our\ninherited habits and standard ways of doing things run into trouble,\nperhaps through our actions\u2019 having unexpected consequences,\nthrough our having developed new needs and desires that are unmet in\ncurrent circumstances, or through conflict among our own goals and\nprojects or with those of others. These challenges prompt us to step\nback, identify the problem that confronts us, and reflect on what to\ndo next. Modern societies have an awesome exemplar of successful\ninquiry, in the natural sciences which, Dewey argues, have been\nprogressive and cumulative, giving us greater and greater\nunderstanding and control of the natural world. This has above all\nbeen the result of their experimental character, in which no\nintellectual element is taken to be beyond rational scrutiny. Theories\nand hypotheses are invented, used, tested, revised, and so on. At the\nsame time, new methods for the invention, use, testing and revision of\ntheories and hypotheses are developed and refined, and so are new\nstandards for evaluating theories and hypotheses. What counts as\nsuccess in inquiry is some practice\u2019s meeting these standards,\nbut these standards themselves may be judged in the light of how they\nsquare with ongoing practices of inquiry. In this way, the methods\nused by science are not fixed but themselves have a history and\ndevelop progressively and sometimes in unexpected ways. A crucial\ndimension of the experience that has established these standards and\npractices is social or communal, as we must look to the community of\nour fellow inquirers for testing and confirmation of our findings.\n\nDewey\u2019s conception of inquiry is intended as a general model of\nreflective intelligence: we struggle with problems in all sorts of\nareas of human experience, including art and ethics. Accordingly he\nrejects non-cognitivism about values and holds that values can be true\nor false in his pragmatic sense, responsive to reasons and corrigible\nin the light of experience. He argues that we should generally think\nof values or ideals as hypotheses about what course of action to take,\nforged reflectively in response to problematic situations, with the\naim of providing means for what Dewey calls their \u201cdirected\nresolution\u201d (most fully in these terms in the late work,\nTheory of Valuation (LW13)). Practical inquiry\nencompasses instrumental reasoning about means: so if we our path to\nthe beach is blocked by a giant rock (the problematic situation) we\ncan reflect on what it would involve to take another route, to climb\nthe rock, to dynamite it, etc., and can imaginatively rehearse the\noptions. This inquiry also includes reflective criticism of ends: if\nthe journey now has to include arduous rock-climbing, we may\nreconsider how important our end of getting to the beach is, or of the\nvalue we attach to it. Inquiry as practical judgment involves\nreflecting on, criticising and revising our ends, in the light of what\nis involved for us in achieving them, and this often leads us\ncreatively to transform our values and to develop new ends.\n\nIn this context, Dewey develops a particular conception of moral\ntheory. Deliberation as inquiry is concerned with judging ends and\nchoosing means to achieve those ends. There are situations, though, in\nwhich an agent is presented with a conflict of ends or goals which is\nnot straightforwardly susceptible to being settled by reference to\nsome higher order end possessed by the agent. In the case of ethics, a\nmoral problem presents \u201calternative ends so heterogeneous\u201d\nthat they appeal to different kinds of disposition in the agent\n(Ethics, first edition, MW5, 192). Dewey and Tufts\ngive as an example a pacifist citizen whose state goes to war:\n\nHe is deeply attached to his own state. He has formed habits of\nloyalty and of abiding by its laws, and now one of its decrees is that\nhe shall support war. He feels in addition gratitude and affection for\nthe country which has sheltered and nurtured him. But his believes\nthat this war is unjust, or perhaps he has a condition that all war is\na form of murder and hence wrong. One side of his nature, one set of\nconvictions and habits, leads him to acquiesce in war; another deep\npart of his being protests. He is torn between two duties: he\nexperiences a conflict between the incompatible values presented to\nhim by his habits of citizenship and by his religious beliefs\nrespectively. Up to this time, he has never experienced a struggle\nbetween the two; they have coincided and reenforced one another. Now\nhe has to make a choice between competing moral loyalties and\nconvictions. The struggle is not between a good which is clear to him\nand something else which attracts him but which he knows to be wrong.\nIt is between values each of which is an undoubted good in its place\nbut which now get in each other\u2019s way. He is forced to reflect\nin order to come to a decision. Moral theory is a generalised\nextension of the kind of thinking in which he now engages.\n(Ethics, 2nd edition, LW7, 165)\n\n\nIn spite of his doubts about moral theory as an external standard for\njudging social institutions, Dewey isn\u2019t a sceptic about\ninherited moral theory. Rather, he interprets it as as a repertoire of\nconceptual resources and tools that we have for dealing with the\nproblems of value judgement in a world of plural and changing values.\nIn Ethics, Dewey and Tufts offer an interpretation of\ndifferent canonical value theories, teleology, deontology and virtue\nethics as providing contrasting methodological orientations for\nidentifying, describing and solving problems. Moral theories are\ngenerated in contingent historical circumstances, are responsive to\nthe particular needs and conflicts of those circumstances, and reflect\ntheir prejudices and assumption. Ideals and values that were\nfunctional for a particular social order can cease to make sense or\nbecome dysfunctional as that order changes. Instead of asking which of\nthese approaches best captures \u201cour intuitions\u201d and so\nshould be used as an unvarying standard to guide decision-making in\nconcrete situations, Dewey argues that no one approach constitutes a\ntheoretically adequate guide to how to act in particular situations.\nInstead, these provide standpoints from which agents can identify and\nanalyze problems, sift important from unimportant considerations, and\nwork out whether what we desire or value is really desirable or\nvaluable. Conflict among these approaches cannot be resolved in\ntheory, only in practice and in particular contexts, if at all, where\nan agent must make \u201cthe best adjustment he can among forces\nwhich are genuinely disparate\u201d (\u201cThree Independent Factors\nin Morals\u201d, MW5, 288). Recall his claim that immanent\ncriticism has the virtue of being \u201cexperimental and hence \u2026\nchecked up by social processes similar to those which suggest\nit\u201d. Experimentalism is immanent in the sense that it is carried\nout and embodied by particular agents confronted with the particular\nproblems they grapple with, agents who are themselves constituted by\nthe social habitat they grapple with, and uses the criteria of\njudgment provided by that habitat. At the same time, it is\nexperimental in the sense that the exercise of intelligence does not\ninvolve unreflectively applying these criteria but reflectively\ntesting and challenging them in the light of experience. At the social\nlevel, the model of ethical deliberation is not that of trying to\nimplement a given standard:\n\nthe process of growth, of improvement and progress, rather than the\nstatic outcome and result, becomes the significant thing. Not health\nas an end fixed once and for all, but the needed improvement in health\n\u2013 a continual process \u2013 is the end and good. The end is no\nlonger a terminus or limit to be reached. It is the active process of\ntransforming the existing situation. Not perfection as a final goal,\nbut the ever-enduring process of perfecting, maturing, refining is the\naim in living \u2026 Growth itself is the only moral \u201cend\u201d.\n(Reconstruction in Philosophy, MW12, 181)\n\n\nAs Dewey and Tufts put it, this experimentalism tells us about\n\u201cthe method by which the criterion should be reached and the\nspirit in which it is employed, namely, the experimental.That\nstatement concerns the form of the criterion rather than its content\nor substance\u201d (Ethics, 2nd edition\n, LW7, 343). This is not all that can be said about the\ncontent of a criterion of social judgment, however: Dewey and Tufts go\non to explain that \u201ctheir position is that past experience\nenables us to state a criterion of judgment which is sufficiently\ndefinite to be usable and sufficiently flexible to lead to its own\nreinterpretation as experience progresses\u201d ((Ethics,\n2nd edition, LW7, 343) \u2013 to tell us\nsomething about content or substance, in other words. Dewey provides a\nhistoricised form of ethical naturalism, which fleshes out the\ncriterion of social judgment. In this vein, Dewey says that \u201cthe\nmeasure of the worth of any social institution, economic, domestic,\npolitical, legal, religious, is its effect in enlarging and improving\nexperience\u201d (Democracy and Education, MW9, 9).\nOne way in which we can see Dewey\u2019s account as substantive is in\nthe practical virtues that he thinks accompany the commitment to\nexperimentalism. Social practices that promote free and open learning\nhave the instrumental epistemic benefits of growing knowledge and\nunderstanding, increasing the capacity to control experience, and\nproviding a richer and more dynamic environment, and we benefit if we\nare prepared to be open-minded in dealing with this environment.\nBeyond this, though, Dewey has a conception of what it is to judge a\nsocial group based on its relationship to its members. For example, he\nwrites in Democracy and Education:\n\nNow in any social group whatsoever, even in a gang of thieves, we find\nsome interest held in common and we find a certain amount of\ninteraction and cooperative intercourse with other groups. From these\ntwo traits we derive our standard. How numerous and varied are the\ninterests which are consciously shared? How full and free is the\ninterplay with other forms of association? If we apply these\nconsiderations to, say, the members of a criminal band, we find that\nthe ties which consciously hold the members together are few in\nnumber, reducible almost to a common interest in plunder; and that\nthey are of such a nature as to isolate the group from other groups\nwith respect to give and take of the values of life. Hence the\neducation such a society gives is partial and distorted. If we take,\non the other hand, the kind of family life which illustrates the\nstandard, we find that there are material, intellectual, aesthetic\ninterests in which all participate and that the progress of one member\nhas worth for the experience of other members \u2013 it is readily\ncommunicable \u2013 and that the family is not an isolated whole, but\nenters intimately into relationships with business interests, with\nschools, with all the agencies of culture, as well as with other\nsimilar groups, and that it plays a due part in the political\norganisation and in return receives support from it. In short, there\nare many interests consciously communicated and shared; and there are\nvaried and free modes of association with other modes of association.\n(MW9, 89)\n\n\nAuthoritarian or anti-social groups have to stunt their members\u2019\ninterests and allegiances in order to maintain their hold over them.\nAs Dewey puts it, reflecting on the gang of thieves in The Public\nand Its Problems, it is possible for a member of the gang\n\u201cto express his powers in a way consonant with belonging to that\ngroup and be directed by the interest common to its members\u201d but\nhe can do so \u201conly at the cost of repression of his\npotentialities which can be realized only through membership of other\ngroups\u201d and through \u201cthe free give-and-take\u201d that is\nthe condition for \u201cthe fullness of integrated personality\u201d\n(LW2, 328). The free communication of interests and open\ninteraction within and beyond a group provide a standard for judging\nsocial groups. This is also in a certain sense formal, since as a\ncriterion it is not a moral demand with a particular determinate\ncontent but is itself a tool for dealing with experience to be used or\napplied experimentally by the individuals involved.\n",
