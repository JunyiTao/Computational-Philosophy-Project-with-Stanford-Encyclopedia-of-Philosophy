    "main_text": "Herder, Sulzer and Herz: Energy, Activity and Truth || Herder\n5.1 Herder\n\nJohann Gottfried Herder (1744\u20131803) is most often remembered\nfor his philosophy of history, expounded with relative brevity in his\n1774 work This Too a Philosophy of History for the Education of\nHumanity and at great length in his Ideas for the Philosophy\nof History of Humanity, published from 1784 to 1791. He is\ntypically read as having advocated cultural relativism and\nhistoricism against the universalist pretensions of the\nEnlightenment\u2014manifested in aesthetics in the search for a\nuniversally valid \u201cstandard of taste\u201d\u2014and thus as\nhaving been a forerunner of Romanticism. Our focus here will be on\nHerder\u2019s work in aesthetics, which fully occupied him for the first\nfifteen years of his career, as well as at the very end of his\ncareer, when he wrote a vigorous polemic against the aesthetic theory\nof Kant. In this section we will consider Herder\u2019s early work in\naesthetics, while discussion of his later work will be reserved for\nsection 9.\n\n\nHerder came from East Prussia, and from 1762 to 1764 was a student in\nK\u00f6nigsberg, where he studied with Kant. He later turned away from\nKant, whom he saw as having himself turned away from an empirical\napproach to philosophy to one that is excessively abstract and a\npriori. From 1762 to 1769, he taught school in Riga, and then\nleft for a tour of France and Western Germany, during which he met the\nyoung Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, shortly to become famous for The\nSorrows of Young Werther. Indeed, after Herder served as preacher\nin the small court of B\u00fcckeburg from 1771 to 1776, Goethe had him\nappointed as the General Superintendent of Lutheran clergy in the\nDuchy of Weimar, where Goethe himself was the chief minister. This\nposition, which Herder occupied for the rest of his life, gave him\nample time to write and put him into contact with the many other\nleading figures of late eighteenth-century German literary and\nintellectual life whom Goethe brought to Weimar.\n\n\nHerder\u2019s first major work in aesthetics, Fragments on Recent\nGerman Literature, appeared in 1767, when he was only\ntwenty-three. The first three volumes of his next work, the Groves\nof Criticism (Kritische Waelder) were published in\n1769. The first volume of the Groves is a spirited but\nfriendly critique of Lessing\u2019s Laoco\u00f6n, the next two a\ndetailed polemic against the now forgotten Halle rhetorician Christian\nKlotz (whom Lessing also attacked in a 1769 essay on \u201cHow the\nAncients Depicted Death\u201d). The fourth volume, a polemic against\nthe now equally forgotten Friedrich Justus Riedel, who had published a\nhodgepodge Theory of the Fine Arts and Sciences: Extracts from\nvarious Authors in 1767, remained unpublished during Herder\u2019s\nlifetime. Herder did, however, restate its most important ideas\nin Sculpture: Some Observations on Shape and Form from Pygmalion\u2019s\nCreative Dream, begun in 1770 although itself not completed and\npublished until 1778. Herder\u2019s work on Sculpture was\ninterrupted by several of what are now his best-known works,\nthe Treatise on the Origin of Language (1772) and This\nToo a Philosophy of History for the Education of Humanity\n(1774). After finishing Sculpture, Herder published a\ncollection of folk poetry from around the world, Popular\nSongs (1778\u201379), a work on the Old Testament, On the\nSpirit of Hebrew Poetry (1782\u201383), the large work on\nphilosophy of history already mentioned, an influential defense of\nSpinoza under the name of God: Some Conversations (1787), a\nwork on political philosophy, the Letters for the Advancement of\nHumanity (1793\u201397), and finally his critiques of Kant\u2019s\ntheoretical philosophy and aesthetics, A Metacritique on the\nCritique of Pure Reason (1799) and the Kalligone or\n\u201cBirth of Beauty\u201d (1800).  In these works Kant\u2019s harsh\ncriticisms of his quondam student\u2019s Ideas for a Philosophy of\nHistory of Humanity were repaid with interest.\n\n\nLessing, as we saw, had argued that visual art presents an object as\nit is at a single moment and thus can only intimate an action, while\npoetry describes a succession of states comprising an action and thus\ncan represent an object only by describing the act of producing it; he\nalso argued that beauty is the first law of the visual arts and thus\nthat a work of art must not only depict an object at a pregnant moment\nin an action or event but must also depict it at a beautiful\nmoment. In his critique in the first of his Groves of\nCriticism, Herder argues that Lessing\u2019s division of the arts was\ntoo schematic and incomplete, offering three particular points of\ncriticism against Lessing. He first claims that Lessing fails to\nexplain why beauty must be the first law of the visual arts. He\nfurther insists that there is an essential difference within\nthe so-called visual arts that Lessing fails to capture, namely that\npainting is concerned strictly with with the sense of sight whereas\nthe aesthetics of sculpture in fact derive primarily from the sense of\ntouch. Herder\u2019s third critical thesis is that Lessing\u2019s emphasis on\ntime and succession in poetry better fits the art of music, which\nLessing ignored, while the essence of poetry lies not in such an\naccidental feature of the kind of signs that it uses but in the way in\nwhich it captures and communicates the energy of real life,\nsomething no other art does equally well. Herder\u2019s contrast between\npainting and sculpture becomes central in the argument of the fourth\nof the Groves of Criticism and in the essay\non Sculpture, so let us consider the other two themes first\nand then return to that one.\n\n\nHerder\u2019s first charge is that Lessing fails to explain why beauty must\nbe the first law of the visual arts. In Herder\u2019s view, visual art must\naim at beauty because only in that way can it overcome the essential\nconflict between its own spatial, static character and the incessantly\nchanging, transitory character of everything in nature.\nIn nature everything is transitory, the passion of\nthe soul and the sensation of the body: the activity of the soul and\nthe motion of the body: every state of changeable finite nature. Now\nif art has only one instant in which everything is to be contained:\nthen every alterable state of nature is unnaturally immortalized\nthrough it, and thus with this principle all imitation of nature\nthrough art cease. (\u201cFirst Grove,\u201d p.  133)\n\n\nFurthermore, all ordinary sensuous pleasures are\nalso momentary: \u201cAll sensible joys are only for the first\nglance\u201d (\u201cFirst Grove,\u201d p. 134). The only way\nfor an essentially static art to overcome the transitory nature of\nboth what it depicts and of ordinary pleasures is by picking a\nbeautiful moment which is as it were exempt from the actual\ntransitoriness of an object\u2019s history in real nature and our pleasure\nin which also does not fade like other pleasures do (\u201cFirst\nGrove,\u201d p. 137). In other words, our pleasure in beauty in a\nsense lifts us out of the ordinary passage of time. However, Herder\nquickly adds that not any kind of beauty can do this: bodily beauty\nis too closely connected with time, so a truly beautiful work must\nsomehow instead intimate the beauty of soul rather than body:\n\u201cCorporeal beauty is not satisfying: through our eye there\nlooks a soul, and through the beauty that is represented to us a soul\nthus also peers\u201d (\u201cFirst Grove,\u201d\npp. 137\u20138).\n\n\nHowever, this opening sally against Lessing is misleading in two\nregards, first for its suggestion that the task for aesthetics is to\ngive a better explanation of beauty than Lessing did and second for\nits suggestion that aesthetics must be grounded on a metaphysical\ndistinction between mind and body. The latter suggestion is misleading\nbecause Herder does more than almost anyone else in eighteenth-century\nGermany to minimize any separation between mind and body. This is a\nresult of his emphasis on the connection between thought and speech,\nbodily sensation and expression, and the natural and man-made\nenvironment of the linguistic community. The former suggestion is also\nmisleading because, while Herder will go on to argue that painting in\nparticular strives after beauty, he also links beauty to mere\nappearance Indeed, he connects beauty with illusion. Herder also\nargues that both sculpture, which he emphatically distinguishes from\npainting, and poetry ultimately aim much more at truth than\nat beauty. Herder\u2019s path to this conclusion is not direct, however,\nand just what sense or senses of truth he has in mind is difficult to\npin down, so we will have to look at his classification of the arts in\nsome detail to see how to construe his theory.\n\n\nIn fact, Herder suggests two different classifications of the arts,\nand a central challenge in the interpretation of his aesthetics is to\nsee how they are connected. In the first of the Groves of\nCriticism, Herder argues that Lessing\u2019s distinction between the\nvisual arts as the representation of objects in space at a single\nmoment in time and poetry as the representation of a succession of\nevents in time confuses poetry with music. Lessing thereby misses what\nis essential to poetry altogether, namely that it communicates to us\nthe real force of objects, including but not limited to\nactions, and thus most deeply engages our own force in response. The\nfirst part of this argument is that the contrast between the\ncoexistence of the properties of an object in space and the succession\nof events in time properly grounds the contrast between painting and\nmusic, not between painting and poetry, and that both painting and\nmusic depend upon natural signs of coexistence and succession\n(\u201cFirst Grove,\u201d p. 193).  Both painting\u2014which Herder\nis thus far, like Lessing, using as a generic term for the visual arts\ncomprising both painting proper and sculpture\u2014and music use\nnatural signs, that is, signs that communicate the thought of their\nobjects to us by means of resemblance between their own fundamental\nproperties and the fundamental properties of their objects. Painting\nand music are thus best suited to represent objects in space and\nsuccessions of events in time, respectively.  Poetry, however, uses primarily\nartificial rather than natural signs, and is thus, unlike music, not\nrestricted to the depiction of events as Lessing thought it was\n(\u201cFirst Grove,\u201d pp. 193\u20134).  Herder turns Lessing\u2019s\ndistinction between natural and artificial signs against him, arguing\nthat precisely because poetry uses artificial rather than natural\nsigns its content is in no fundamental way constrained by the natural\nproperties of its signs themselves. Thus, in the proper hands poetry\ncan effectively represent anything, and in this way it\ncertainly has a wider sphere of truth accessible to it than\npainting or music do.\n\n\nBut this is only the first step of Herder\u2019s argument.  The second step\nargues that just as Lessing\u2019s division of the arts into painting and\npoetry is incomplete, the distinction between space and time on which\nthe former division is based is also incomplete. This is because\nLessing\u2019s distinction leaves out the essential category\nof force (Kraft), and precisely this last category\nis essential to the effect of poetry (\u201cFirst Grove,\u201d\np. 194). Herder is not particularly clear about the difference between\nthe energy (Energie) that is displayed in music and the force that is at work in poetry, but his idea seems to be\nthat energy is the outward manifestation, in change or motion,\nof underlying forces. Poetry, precisely because it employs\nartificial rather than natural signs, can therefore bring us closer to\nthe reality that underlies the superficial features of objects\ncaptured by artificial signs. Thus poetry may reach not only wider but\nalso deeper than these other arts.\n\n\nIn continuing his discussion of poetry in the first Grove,\nHerder initially emphasizes the broader reach of poetry: precisely\nbecause in taking in poetry we do not focus on the physical or\nacoustical properties of the signs themselves, but on their meanings,\npoetry can represent anything. In poetry, it is\nnot the sign itself but the sense [Sinn] of the sign that\nmust be felt; the soul must not feel the vehicle of the force, the\nwords, but the force itself, the sense\u2026But thereby it\nalso brings every object as it were visibly before the\nsoul. (\u201cFirst Grove,\u201d p. 195)\n\n\nHerder then develops his view by invoking\nBaumgarten\u2019s characterization of poetry as \u201cthe sensibly perfect\nin discourse.\u201d What he now argues is that poetry actually gets\nits force by exploiting both the depiction of objects as in painting\nand their energy as represented by music. Once painting and music have\nbeen properly distinguished from each other and poetry from both, it\nbecomes clear that poetry, because it uses artificial rather than\nnatural signs, can present both objects and actions to us. It is in\nthis sense that poetry can present more truth to us than either\npainting or music alone.\n\n\nWhat remains unclear, however, is just what Herder means by\n\u201cforce\u201d here. He only hints at what he might mean a few\npages later when he says that \u201cthe essence of poetry\u201d is\n\u201cthe force, which adheres to the inner in words, the magical\nforce, which works on my soul through fantasy and recollection\u201d\n(\u201cFirst Grove,\u201d p. 197). The force unique to poetry seems\nto be precisely its power to make us feel as if the objects and events\nit describes are real and thereby to engage our own emotions and\npassions more fully than the other arts can. But he may make clearer\nwhat he has in mind in his praise for the poetry of primitive peoples\nin a famous 1773 essay on what were later to be revealed to be the\nfraudulent poems of the fictional Scottish bard \u201cOssian.\u201d\nThis essay was included in a collection On German Style and\nArt that also included Herder\u2019s equally famous essay on\nShakespeare (to which we will return below) and a seminal essay by\nGoethe that revived interest in Gothic architecture. Here Herder declaims:\n\n\nKnow then, that the more barbarous a people is\u2014that is, the more\nalive, the more freely acting (for that is what the word\nmeans)\u2014the more barbarous, that is, the more alive, the more\nfree, the closer to the senses, the more lyrically dynamic its songs\nwill be, if songs it has. The more remote a people is from an\nartificial, scientific manner of thinking, speaking, and writing, the\nless its songs are made for paper and print, the less its verses are\nwritten for the dead letter. The purpose, the nature, the miraculous\npower of these songs as the delight, the driving-force, the\ntraditional chant and everlasting joy of the people\u2014all this\ndepends on the lyrical, living, dance-like quality of the song, on the\nliving presence of the images, and the coherence and, as it were\ncompulsion of the content, the feelings; on the symmetry of the words\nand syllables, and sometimes even of the letters, on the flow of the\nmelody, and on a hundred other things which belong to the living\nworld, to the gnomic song of the nation, and vanish with\nit. (\u201cOssian,\u201d pp. 155\u20136)\n\n\nLeave aside the fact that the poems of the supposed Ossian were\nconcocted in eighteenth-century Edinburgh by James MacPherson, and\nwere thus very much made for paper and print. Leave aside as well\nHerder\u2019s supposition that the most dynamic poetry can only be composed\nby a \u201cbarbarous people,\u201d Mycenaen Greeks or Scottish\nhighlanders. The point remains that he connects the \u201cliving\npresence of the images\u201d achieved by the most effective poetry\nwith a corresponding feeling of freedom and of being\nalive. Paradoxically, poetry\u2019s use of artificial rather than natural\nsigns, which allows it to achieve the effects of painting and music\ncombined, also allows it to engage our deepest emotions more\nthoroughly than those other arts, including ultimately the joyous\nfeeling of being alive itself, even though the other arts use natural\nsigns and might therefore have been thought to be more effective.\n\n\nWe may now turn to Herder\u2019s second main criticism of Lessing, hinted\nat in the first of the Groves of Criticism but more fully\ndeveloped in the unpublished fourth Grove and the essay on Sculpture. The fourth Grove\nis cast as a critique of Riedel\u2019s Theory of the Fine Sciences and\nArts, as earlier noted, but also continues the debate with\nLessing. Herder begins with several methodological objections to\nRiedel. First, although he otherwise admires Baumgarten, Herder\ncriticizes Riedel\u2019s acceptance of Baumgarten\u2019s characterization of\naesthetics as both a theory of beauty and \u201cthe art of thinking\nbeautifully,\u201d that is, a prescription of concrete rules and\nmethods for artists to follow in order to produce beautiful or\notherwise successful works (\u201cFourth Grove,\u201d\np. 267). Herder is clear that there are no such rules, thus that\naesthetics must confine itself to understanding the work of artists\nand our experience of their work without telling them how to do that\nwork. Second, Herder objects to a tripartite classification of the\nmethods of aesthetics, as such a theory, that Riedel\nproposes. According to Riedel, aesthetic theories can be divided into\nthose employing the methods of Aristotle, Baumgarten, or Kames: the\nAristotelian method aims to reach general principles from the analysis\nof particular masterpieces of art, the method of Kames tries to reach\nthe same goal from the analysis of our sensations in response to\naesthetic objects, and what Riedel characterizes as the\n\u201cmiserable dry\u201d method of Baumgarten simply begins from\ndefinitions (\u201cFourth Grove,\u201d p. 262). In Herder\u2019s view,\nthese distinctions are artificial and the characterization of\nBaumgarten\u2019s method in particular is unfair. Although the charge that\nBaumgarten simply began with definitions may seem a fair critique of\nhis early Meditations on Poetry, Herder must have felt that\nin his larger and more mature Aesthetica Baumgarten did\nsupport his definitions by his extensive examples. In any case,\nHerder\u2019s own method is certainly to reach general conclusions only\nfrom close examination of examples of art and of our response to\nthem. This is why he engages Lessing in such detail, for example, and\nwhy some of his most important claims in aesthetics are contained in\nthe essays on Ossian and Shakespeare. Further, Herder\u2019s approach ends\nrather than begins with definitions.\n\n\nThe main thrust of the fourth Grove, building upon Herder\u2019s\ninsistence that aesthetics must employ the methods of both Aristotle\nand Kames in order to reach Baumgartian conclusions, is that\nrecognition of the distinctions among our senses will explain the\nvariety of both forms of art and forms of aesthetic response. The\npremise of Herder\u2019s argument is that aesthetic response is not the\ndisinterested reaction of a special internal sense to purely formal\nproperties of objects, but is really the heightened response of\nvarious of our senses to their appropriate objects. Aesthetic\nresponses naturally emerge from our senses. Herder rejects the\ntraditional distinction between mind and body, arguing that mind is\nessentially connected to the bodily organs of sense, as well as any\nsuggestion that aesthetic pleasures are essentially distinct from the\nother sources of our happiness and unhappiness. In this connection,\nHerder scorns Riedel\u2019s thesis that the beautiful is that \u201cwhich\ncan please without an interested aim and thus also please if we do not\npossess it\u201d (\u201cFourth Grove,\u201d p. 291n.), thereby\nprefiguring his later critique of Kant\u2019s aesthetics.  Instead, Herder\nargues that the phenomenon of distance that Riedel mistakenly\ncharacterizes as general quality of disinterestedness in all aesthetic\nresponse is a specific feature of the visual perception of beauty,\nindeed that beauty is properly speaking a property only of the\nvisual. This in turn leads Herder to distinguish between sight as a\nsense for mere appearance and touch as the sense for reality, and thus\nto the essential distinction between painting and sculpture which, he\ncharges, Lessing fails to make. Herder insists that visible beauty\narises only from the most superficial features of objects, not from\ntheir full reality, and that only feeling\u2014by which he here means\nthe sense of touch\u2014can put us into direct contact with reality,\nor with the deeper truth about physical reality. He expands upon this\ncontrast in the essay on Sculpture:\n\n\nThe term Sch\u00f6nheit [beauty] derives from the\nwords Schauen [to behold] and Schein\n[appearance]. Beauty can most easily be understood and appreciated in\nterms of Schauen, that is, through sch\u00f6ner Schein\n[beautiful appearance]. Nothing is faster, more dazzlingly brilliant\nthan the light of the sun and our eyes carried upon its wing. A world\nof external things ranged alongside one another is revealed in an\ninstant. Since this world does not disappear as do sounds, but endures\nand invites contemplation, is it any wonder that our doctrine\nof psychology chooses to borrow many of its terms from this sense?\nFor psychology, to know is to see, and its greatest pleasure\nis beauty\u2026. If we succeeded in \u201cderiving\u201d\nfrom this sense alone a true phenomenology of\nthe beautiful and the true, we should already have\nachieved a great deal.\n\nNonetheless, we would not thereby have achieved everything and\ncertainly not what is most fundamental, simple, and\nprimary\u2026. The living, embodied truth of the three-dimensional\nspace of angles, of form and volume, is not something we can learn\nthrough sight. This is all the more true of the essence of\nsculpture, beautiful form and beautiful shape, for\nthis is not a matter of color, or of the play of proportion and\nsymmetry, or of light and shadow, but of physically present,\ntangible truth\u2026. Consider the lover of art sunk deep in\ncontemplation who circles restlessly around a sculpture. What would he\nnot do to transform his sight into touch, to make his seeing\ninto a form of touching that feels in the dark\u2026. With\nhis soul he seeks to grasp the image that arose from the arm\nand the soul of the artist. Now he has it!  The illusion has worked;\nthe sculpture lives and his soul feels that it lives. His\nsoul speaks to it, not as if his soul sees, but as if it touches, as\nif it feels. (Sculpture, pp. 39\u201341)\n\n\n\nHerder\u2019s emphasis on the sense of touch and its centrality to the\nexperience of sculpture builds upon his interpretation of the debate about the relation between sight and touch\nin which Locke, Berkeley, and Diderot had all argued that we do not\ncorrelate the deliverances of the two senses innately, but have to\nlearn from experience that an object that looks a certain way also\nfeels a certain way, or vice versa (see Sculpture, pp.\n33\u20138). But he takes this thesis a step further by arguing that\nit is touch that reveals the true form of objects, while sight merely\nreveals or plays with their superficial appearance. Thus, although\nsight initially seemed to be the paradigmatic vehicle of knowledge,\nHerder ultimately concludes that \u201cin painting there is merely\nbeautiful deception\u201d while in sculpture there is \u201cprimary\ntruth\u201d (\u201cFourth Grove,\u201d p. 314).  The passages\nfrom Sculpture also display what Herder thinks is the\nsignificance of the perception of the true form of objects through the\ntactile medium of sculpture: it communicates to us the feeling of life\nin the sculpture and in turn arouses our own feeling of being truly\nalive. In the case of sculpture, both the artist and the audience can\nfully feel the emotions and passions of life that made Pygmalion wish\nthat his beautiful creation could come alive. This view of the power\nof art is what Herder finds missing in Riedel and perhaps even in\nLessing himself.\n\n\nIn the fourth Grove, Herder also has interesting things to\nsay about arts we have not mentioned, namely, dance, architecture, and\nhorticulture, and an important passage about music, which he analyzes\nas the \u201cimitation of human passions,\u201d arousing \u201ca\nseries of inner feelings, true, although not distinct, not intuitive,\nonly extremely obscure\u201d (\u201cFourth Grove,\u201d pp.\n406\u20137). But we will have to leave these arts aside and conclude\nour discussion of Herder with a comment on his supposed historical and\ncultural relativism, which, as was earlier noted, has often been\nthought to be his central contribution to modern thought.  Herder\u2019s\nwritings are certainly replete with observations connecting the\ndifferent circumstances and mores of different cultures and times with\ndifferences in their arts and tastes. For example: \u201cThe Greek,\nthe Gothic, the Moorish taste in architecture and sculpture, in\nmythology and in poetry, is it the same? And is [the difference] not\nto be explained from times, mores, and peoples?\u201d (\u201cFourth\nGrove,\u201d p. 286). And in his essay on Shakespeare, he attacks the\nrigid insistence on unity of time, place, and action in classical\nFrench theater by arguing that these ideals grew naturally out of the\ncircumstances of both Greek theater and Greek life, but that it is\nabsurd to make them into rigid rules in the very different\ncircumstances of both modern theater and modern life\n(\u201cShakespeare,\u201d pp. 162\u20133).\n\n\nHowever, it would be a mistake to infer from such comments that Herder\ndoes not think that there are underlying commonalities in the arts and\ntastes of different times and places, or that people living in one\ntime and culture cannot learn to appreciate deeply the art of another\ntime and culture. On the contrary, the argument of the essay on\nShakespeare is that the best art of different times and\nplaces\u2014for example, the theater of Sophocles and that of\nShakespeare\u2014must differ superficially precisely because\nat the deepest level they are committed to the same\nprinciple\u2014the truthful imitation of nature\u2014but\nhave different natures to imitate. Thus he writes that the\nunities of time, place, and action were not artificial for the Greeks\nat all, although it would be for moderns (\u201cShakespeare,\u201d\np. 163). Further, it is precisely because the Greek \u201cview of the\nworld, their customs, the state of the republics, the tradition of the\nheroic age, religion, even music, expression, and the degrees of\nillusion changed\u201d (\u201cShakespeare,\u201d p. 164), that the drama of\nShakespeare was bound to be different than that of Sophocles. It was\nbound to be different because while all these things changed,\nShakespeare was committed to the same underlying principle of\ntruthfully representing his own world that his drama, unlike that of\nthe misguided French classicists, had to look and sound\ndifferent. If Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cworld did not offer such simplicity\nof history, traditions, domestic, political, and religious conditions,\nthen of course it will not display it\u201d in his work either.\nInstead, he will create his \u201cdrama out of [his world\u2019s] own\nhistory, the spirit of its age, customs, views, language, national\nattitudes, traditions, and pastimes\u201d (\u201cShakespeare,\u201d\np. 167). But in doing so, Shakespeare was in fact doing the same thing\nas Sophocles:\nFor Shakespeare is Sophocles\u2019s brother, precisely\nwhere he seems to be so dissimilar, and inwardly he is wholly like\nhim. His whole dramatic illusion is attained by means of this\nauthenticity, truth, and historical\ncreativity. (\u201cShakespeare,\u201d p. 172)\n\n\nPrecisely because the art of Sophocles and that of Shakespeare rest on the same underlying principle it is\npossible for people at any time to come to appreciate them both,\nalthough no doubt with the considerable effort it would take to\nappreciate fully their language, their customs, in short, their\nworlds.\n",
