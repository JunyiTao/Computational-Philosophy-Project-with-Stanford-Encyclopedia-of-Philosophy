    "main_text": "Positive research programmes in philosophy of language || On the Meaning of \u2018Woman\u2019\n2.2 On the Meaning of \u2018Woman\u2019\n\nIn her ground-breaking paper \u201cGender and Race: (What) Are They?\n(What) Do We Want Them To Be?\u201d (2000b), Haslanger aims to\nprovide an account of the nature of gender, as well as an account of\nthe meaning of \u2018woman\u2019. She assumes the classical\ndistinction between sex and gender, where sex is supposed to\nrefer to biological or anatomical properties distinguishing males from\nfemales (although as she argues, this distinction is flexible and\npermeated by social and political factors too), and gender is\nsupposed to refer to social or cultural factors distinguishing men\nfrom women (see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender).\n One of the main virtues of Haslanger\u2019s article is that she\nmakes explicit the methodological approach that she endorses, to wit:\nshe famously distinguishes between a descriptive project,\nwhich aims to reveal the concept that we actually use or the property\nthat we actually track with our usage of the term, and an\nanalytical project (or an ameliorative project, as\nshe calls it in Haslanger 2006), which aims to reveal the concept that\nwe should use or the meaning that we should associate to the\ncorresponding term, given our purposes and aims in that inquiry. As\nshe makes clear, she is following the analytical or ameliorative\napproach, with the explicit aim of providing an account of the meaning\nof \u2018gender\u2019 and \u2018woman\u2019 that could be a useful\ntool in order to fight sexism and help to achieve social justice. With\nthis purpose in mind, she comes up with the following definition of\nthe term \u2018woman\u2019, as one particular type of gender:\n\n\nS is a woman iffdef S is\nsystematically subordinated along some dimension (economic, political,\nlegal, social, etc.) and S is \u201cmarked\u201d as a target\nfor this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features presumed to\nbe evidence of a female\u2019s biological role in reproduction.\n(2000b: 39)\n\n\nAs we can see, the main idea of Haslanger\u2019s account is that\ngender is a hierarchical social structure, where some members are\nsituated in a position of privilege and some other members are\nsituated in a position of subordination along social, economic,\npolitical, legal, or cultural dimensions, in virtue of their real or\nimagined biological role in reproduction. And more particularly, being\na woman corresponds to occupying a specific position of subordination\nwith respect to this social structure, due to one\u2019s perceived or\nimagined biologically female bodily features. \n\nHaslanger\u2019s proposal gave rise to a rich debate about the\nvirtues of an ameliorative approach, and the advantages and problems\nof this particular account. For instance, Saul (2006b) argued that\nthis proposed usage of the term \u2018woman\u2019 could have some\nproblematic consequences, such as feminists having to advocate for the\neradication of women, since feminists advocate for the eradication of\nthe subordination of people in terms of their biological role in\nreproduction. For this reason, Saul argued, this might not be the most\nadvantageous way of using the term \u2018woman\u2019. In addition,\nSaul argued that the folk or ordinary concept of \u2018woman\u2019\ndoes not really distinguish between sex as a biological feature and\ngender as a social or cultural feature. Following up on this, Mikkola\n(2011b) argued that it might be very costly to revise the ordinary\nmeaning of \u2018woman\u2019 in considerable ways as Haslanger\nsuggests, since this might jeopardize communication, in addition to\nthe fact that gender identity and the label \u2018woman\u2019 might\nbe a source of identity and pride for many women. Therefore, to\ncharacterize being a woman in terms of being subordinated, as\nHaslanger does, might not be politically useful for the aims of\nfeminism. Mikkola (2011b) put forward an alternative account of\n\u2018woman\u2019 that does not endorse the sex/gender distinction:\nrather, she proposed a trait/norm covariance model, according\nto which there are different traits that are assigned to men or women\n(or males or females) at a certain context, and that are expected to\nbe followed and instantiated. However, the different traits that are\nassigned to men or to women are heavily context-dependent and\nflexible, and it is possible to revise both the assignment of traits\nand the norms and expectations involving them, in virtue of many kinds\nof factors, including moral and political considerations.\n\nMore recently, several feminists have argued that an account of\n\u2018woman\u2019 along the lines of Haslanger\u2019s proposal\nmight fail to do justice to the aims of trans women, which should be\ncentral for the purposes of feminism. For example, Saul (2012) argues\nthat neither standard sex-based accounts nor standard gender-based\naccounts are automatically going to be inclusive of trans women, since\n(at least some) trans women could arguably turn out to be excluded\nfrom the extension of the term \u2018woman\u2019 when defined in\nterms of biological features, or in terms of certain social and\ncultural factors that are usually attributed to biologically female\nindividuals. Saul put forward a possible alternative view, namely, a\ncontextualist view of the meaning of \u2018woman\u2019, as\nfollows:\n\n\nX is a woman is true in a context C iff\nX is human and relevantly similar (according to the standards\nat work in C) to most of those possessing all of the biological\nmarkers of female sex. (2012: 201)\n\n\nAccording to this account, an individual will fall under the extension\nof \u2018woman\u2019 in a certain context when she is sufficiently\nsimilar to those who are biologically female, given the standards of\nsimilarity that are relevant in such context, where these standards\ncan vary from context to context. Saul argues that at first sight,\nthis view seems to give the right results, since it would classify\ntrans women as women in most contexts where, say, self-identifying as\na woman is what is deemed relevant, but on further reflection, she\nargues, the view can give unwanted results. For example, in a\nconservative community where most speakers take for granted that trans\nwomen should not be allowed to use women\u2019s toilets, their usage\nof \u2018woman\u2019 would be such that trans women would not fall\nunder the term, since the relevant criterion of similarity in that\ncontext that those conservative speakers have in mind seems to be\nsomething like having certain chromosomes or certain anatomical\nfeatures, which some trans women lack. In response to this worry, E.\nDiaz-Leon (2016) has argued that we can understand the contextualist\nview in a way that avoids this objection. In particular, she argues,\nwe can understand the relevant standards of similarity at work in each\ncontext as those criteria that are the most politically useful, given\nthe aims and purposes that are morally salient in that context. For\nexample, in the context of a conservative community where trans women\nare not allowed to use women\u2019s toilets, there are moral reasons\nfor focusing on criteria such as self-identifying as a woman, rather\nthan having certain biological features, and this is what makes this\ncriterion the relevant one in that context, and hence what fixes the\nextension of \u2018woman\u2019 in that context, as required.\n\nTalia Bettcher (2013) has also argued that ameliorative accounts of\nthe meaning of \u2018woman\u2019 should take into account the aims\nof trans women. She argues that \u201csingle-meaning\u201d views, according to which \u2018woman\u2019 has a unique meaning that is shared by all speakers, cannot do justice to those aims. Instead, she puts forward a \u201cmultiple-meaning\u201d account, according to which there are several co-existing meanings of the term \u2018woman\u2019 in our society, but where some of those meanings embed world-views that are not only morally and politically problematic, but also factually misguided, such as using \u2018woman\u2019 in a trans-exclusionary way. Because of this, we have good reasons for using the term \u2018woman\u2019 in our speech with the trans-inclusive meaning that trans-friendly communities already associate with the term. She also argues that although it is methodologically useful to rely on intuitions, \u201cit is inappropriate to dismiss alternative ways in which those terms are actually used in trans subcultures; such usage needs to be taken into consideration as part of the analysis\u201d (2013: 235).\n\nMore recently, Katharine\nJenkins (2016) has argued that Haslanger\u2019s original proposal\nexcluded trans women from the extension of the term\n\u2018woman\u2019, which is morally and politically problematic. As\nJenkins argues, trans women who do not pass as cis women\n(that is, those women who were assigned female at birth) do not occupy\na position of subordination in virtue of their perceived or\nimagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female\nbiological role in reproduction, since they are not presumed to have a\nfemale biological role in reproduction (given that they do not pass as\ncis women). For this reason, Haslanger\u2019s account cannot capture\nthe self-identity of those trans women as women, and the ways in which\nthey are subordinated in virtue of their gender identity. In order to\nsolve this problem, Jenkins proposes an ingenious account of gender in\nterms of two elements, namely, gender as a social class, and gender as\nsocial identity, where the former is similar to Haslanger\u2019s\nnotion of gender as social structures, and the latter has to do with\nour own perceptions of our own positioning within those social\nstructures. Following Haslanger\u2019s (2005) account of racial\nidentity, Jenkins suggests an account of gender identity in terms of\nmental maps that serve to guide our own behavior, norms and\nexpectations within the social niches that we live in. (For criticism of Jenkins\u2019 account as insufficiently inclusive of trans women, see Andler 2017.)\n\nIn this section we have focused on semantic accounts of the\nmeaning of \u2018woman\u2019, although recently there has also been\nan explosion of work about the related questions of the\nmetaphysics of gender as a social class, and biological sex\nas a contested category. Some of these discussions have implications\nfor the meanings of the corresponding terms of \u2018woman\u2019 and\n\u2018female\u2019. For example, Saray Ayala and Nadya Vasilyeva\n(2015) provide an account of biological sex in terms of extended,\nflexible biological features, where which features count for being\nmale or female can change from context to context, depending on our\naims and purposes, and where those extended biological features can be\ntaken to incorporate features of the environment, artificial bodily\nfeatures, and so on. On the other hand, Helen Daly (2015) has argued\nthat we should favour accounts of \u2018female\u2019 and\n\u2018woman\u2019 that do not assume a sharp cut-off point between\nthose who fall under the term and those who do not, since this is\nmorally and politically problematic. In addition, Jennifer McKitrick\n(2015) has argued that an account of gender in terms of dispositions\nto behave in certain ways can be politically useful, and can capture\nthe aims of trans women. Finally, Haslanger (2016) has defended a\ncontext-sensitive account of \u2018sex\u2019, where the term can\nhave different meanings, depending on the aims and purposes of the\ninquiry in that context.\n2.3. Ameliorative Projects and Conceptual Engineering\n\nAs we saw in the previous section, Haslanger (2000b) brought attention\nto the need for revisionary or ameliorative approaches in feminist\nphilosophy, as opposed to purely conceptual or descriptive approaches,\nwhich focus on the concept we have or the objective type that we\nactually track. The idea of a revisionary or ameliorative approach to\nthe analysis of our concepts has been a very influential one in\nphilosophy, but Haslanger\u2019s work has served as a kind of\nreminder of the significance of aiming for the concepts that would\nbest serve our purposes and aims, rather than merely revealing the\nordinary concepts that we happen to have, which is the task that many\nprojects in recent mainstream analytic philosophy seem to have paid\nattention to. Haslanger\u2019s work has inspired a lot of interesting\nameliorative projects in philosophy of gender and race and social\nphilosophy more in general (see for instance Glasgow 2006, 2009 and\nMallon 2006 on \u2018race\u2019, Barnes 2016 on\n\u2018disability\u2019, Dembroff 2016 on \u2018sexual\norientation\u2019, as well as many of the papers on\n\u2018woman\u2019, \u2018sex\u2019 and \u2018gender\u2019 cited\nin the previous section). As suggested above, the notion of an\nameliorative project in philosophy is not new, but in our view the\nimpetus that this methodological approach in philosophy has\nexperienced recently owes much to the centrality that this notion has\nplayed in recent developments in philosophy of gender and race over\nthe last two decades.\n\nAs ameliorative projects are becoming more common in mainstream\nanalytic philosophy, they have given rise to a careful examination of\nthe methodological foundations and the metaphysical, semantic and\nepistemic aspects of the ameliorative approach, as well as its moral\nand political implications. Alexis Burgess and David Plunkett\n(2013a,b) have usefully surveyed these and related issues pertaining\nto ameliorative projects in philosophy, and have coined a new label:\nconceptual ethics. They intend this new term to refer to the\nphilosophical reflection about the terms and concepts that we ought to\nuse in different areas, given our best normative reasoning, as well as\nthe methodological and philosophical issues to which these projects\ngive rise. Examples include the nature of the values and normative\nconsiderations that should guide our choice of terms and concepts, as\nwell as semantic questions about the nature and possibility of\nconceptual change and conceptual revision, among many others. One of\nthe advantages of having this new label is that discussions on these\nnormative issues about our talk and thought that were formerly\nscattered can now be more unified and more systematic.\n\nAnother term that is becoming prominent in this area is that of\nconceptual engineering, which is supposed to refer to\nameliorative projects that aim to revise our current concepts and\nengineer new concepts that can better serve our main purposes. This\nterm originates from discussions about Carnap\u2019s methodological\ninsights (see for instance French 2015 for a useful overview), but is\nnow being used in a more general, encompassing sense. Several\nphilosophers have recently argued that we could understand many\ntraditional debates in philosophy as debates in conceptual ethics or\nconceptual engineering (see for instance Floridi 2011 and Plunkett\n2015).\n2.4 Hermeneutical Injustice\n\nAs we saw above, Fricker (2007) argues that there is a distinctive\nkind of injustice that has to do with the inability to properly\nunderstand and communicate important aspects of one\u2019s social\nexperience: she calls this hermeneutical injustice. According\nto Fricker, people in a position of marginalization are prevented from\ncreating concepts, terms and other representational resources that\ncould be used in order to conceptualize and understand their own\nexperiences, especially those having to do with being in that position\nof marginalization. People in a position of power will tend to create\nconcepts and linguistic representations that help to conceptualize the\nexperiences and phenomena that matter to them, rather than\nthe experiences and phenomena that matter the most to people in a\nposition of marginalization. Because of this, members of marginalized\ngroups might suffer from a lacuna in the representational resources\nthat are available to them, and in particular might lack the concepts\nand terms that would allow them to understand and communicate their\nexperiences. In order to illustrate this phenomenon, Fricker (2007)\nfocuses on several examples, such as the articulation of the term\n\u2018sexual harassment\u2019: before the term was coined, victims\nof sexual harassment lacked the language to explain their experiences\nof receiving unwanted sexual advances at work in a way that would make\nclear why those interactions wronged them.\n\nIn the growing literature on hermeneutical injustice, philosophers\nhave mainly focused on the following two central questions: first, how\nto properly understand the phenomenon of hermeneutical injustice\n(namely, what is distinctively epistemic about it, and what\nmakes it unjust); and secondly, how to resist this kind of\ninjustice and how to fill in the corresponding conceptual and\nlinguistic gaps in our collective understanding of situations of\nmarginalization.\n\nRegarding the first question, Laura Beeby (2011) has argued that the\nrelevant notion of hermeneutical injustice is one that focuses on the\nepistemic situation of lacking the relevant concepts and terms, rather\nthan on one\u2019s position within the background social conditions\nthat give rise to it. She argues that, for example, in the case of\nsexual harassment both the victim and the harasser suffer from\nhermeneutical injustice since they both have similar epistemic\nsituations, that is, they both have similar gaps in their collective\nunderstanding of what is going on. As Beeby argues, if we offer a\ncharacterization of hermeneutical injustice in terms of the\nepistemic situation of the subject, and in particular in\nterms of their conceptual gaps, then both the harasser and that\nharassee will be in a situation of hermeneutical injustice, but this\nseems to be in tension with Fricker\u2019s claim that only the victim\nsuffers from hermeneutical injustice. However, as Beeby also\nemphasizes, one could respond, following Fricker, that people in a\nposition of power are epistemically advantaged in another sense,\nnamely, they do have the ability to create concepts and terms that are\nuseful in order to understand and communicate their own experiences\nand the social interactions that matter the most to them. This\ncontrasts with the situation of the marginalized, who lack this\nability.\n\nHowever, the idea that the marginalized lack the ability to\nconceptualize and communicate their own experiences has also been\ncontested by philosophers such as Rebecca Mason (2011), Kristie Dotson\n(2012), Gaile Pohlhaus (2012) and Jos\u00e9 Medina (2013). For\nexample, Mason (2011) and Medina (2013) have both argued that although\nFricker is right that people in a situation of marginalization might\nnot have access to publicly shared terms in order to communicate their\nexperiences to those in a position of power, they might nonetheless be\nable to make sense of their own experiences in a useful way, even\nbefore those public concepts are introduced in the dominant language.\nFor example, in the case of sexual harassment, some victims of sexual\nharassment were able to attend women\u2019s consciousness-raising\nmeetings and talk to each other about their similar experiences, that\nis to say, they were able to understand their experiences and\ncommunicate them to people in the same predicament, even before they\nhad a term like \u2018sexual harassment\u2019. Therefore, Mason\n(2011) argues, it seems plausible to say that members of marginalized\ngroups already have some conceptual resources that enable them to\nunderstand their own social experiences, and what they actually lack\nis the power to introduce these meanings into the collective\nunderstanding, which is unjust, and which results in the fact that\ndominant groups have a distorted understanding of the social\nexperiences of non-dominant groups. Relatedly, Pohlhaus (2012) has\nargued that marginalized subjects are in a better position to notice\ngaps in our collective epistemic resources in order to properly\ndescribe and conceptualize the experiences of those who are socially\noppressed. Moreover, these subjects could work cooperatively with\nother subjects in the same predicament so as to develop new epistemic\nresources that can deal with those spheres of the social world that\npeople in a position of domination do not usually pay attention to.\nHowever, as Pohlhaus argues, it will be difficult to convince the\nprivileged to employ those new epistemic resources developed by the\nmarginalized. She calls this phenomenon of dismissive ignorance\nwillful hermeneutical ignorance.\n\nFurthermore, Dotson (2012)\nhas introduced a new kind of epistemic injustice, in addition to\ntestimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice, namely, what she\ncalls contributory injustice. This kind of epistemic\ninjustice has to do not only with the phenomenon of willfully ignoring\nthe epistemic resources developed by the marginalized, but also with\nthe continuous use of distorted epistemic resources developed by those\nin a position of power, without paying attention to the experiences of\nthe marginalized. This use of faulty conceptual resources acts to\nblock the uptake of the new conceptual resources developed by the\nmarginalized, which leads to further misunderstandings. In addition,\nMedina (2013) has argued that the fact that members of non-dominant\ngroups have the ability to understand their own experiences and\ncommunicate them to each other is a prior and necessary step in order\nto bring new, more sophisticated concepts and terms into our shared\nlanguage. According to Medina, this can also help with our second\nquestion above, namely, how to resist hermeneutical injustice: he\nsuggests that members of dominant groups should be more sensitive to\ninchoate attempts at communication by people in a position of\nsubordination, even before they have access to shared concepts to\nproperly conceptualize those aspects of our social interactions. Finally, Derek E. Anderson (2017) distinguishes a new kind of epistemic injustice, namely, conceptual competence injustice, which occurs when a marginalized subject is not considered to be a competent user of a concept, because of a lack of linguistic or conceptual credibility, when in fact they are perfectly competent. This is different from hermeneutical injustice, Anderson argues, since in cases of hermeneutical injustice marginalized subjects lack access to some important concepts due to structural reasons, whereas in cases of conceptual competence injustice they fully possess the concepts but are regarded as incompetent speakers. However, this kind of injustice is closely related to Dotson\u2019s notion of contributory injustice, since in cases where privileged subjects use distorted or biased hermeneutical resources, they will be more likely to doubt the conceptual competence of marginalized subjects (even if these are in fact more fully competent), which amounts to conceptual competence injustice, and hence the conceptual resources of the marginalized will in turn be less likely to get uptake, which amounts to contributory injustice.\n\nFinally, regarding the question of what kinds of conceptual resources might be\nneeded in order to fill in the hermeneutical gaps in our collective\nunderstandings, Komarine Romdenh-Romluc (2016) argues that what is\nneeded are new terms and concepts that have the correct\nevaluative component, in addition to the right descriptive\ncomponent. For instance, introducing the term \u2018sexual\nharassment\u2019 was very useful because the new term somehow implies\nthat sexual harassment is wrong, whereas previous terms such as\n\u2018harmless flirting\u2019 did not connote the appropriate\nnegative evaluative component. Likewise, as Medina (2013) argues, the\nappropriation of terms such as \u2018gay\u2019 and\n\u2018queer\u2019 by the LGBT community can be seen as a strategy\nfor overcoming a situation of hermeneutical injustice, since these\nterms came to express new, positive conceptions of same-sex desire, in\ncontrast to old conceptions of it as something pathological or\nperverse. In addition, George Hull (forthcoming) argues that\nconsciousness-raising is very important, not only as a means to\novercoming hermeneutical injustice, but it \u201ccan itself\nconstitute the overcoming of hermeneutical injustice\u201d (2016:\n13). He focuses on the case of black South Africans during apartheid,\nand he argues, drawing on the work of Black Consciousness theorists\nsuch as B.S. Biko and N.B. Pityana, that they were liable to\nexperience a mismatch between their experiences of racism and\noppression, and the collective hermeneutical resources available to\nthem. Because of this, consciousness-raising can help to correct false\nor distorted conceptions and images of themselves, and to develop new\nconceptual tools in order to make sense of those aspects of their\nlives. Furthermore, Charlie Crerar (2016) has argued that the\ninjustice associated with lack of hermeneutical resources does not\noccur only in cases of conceptual absence (i.e. conceptual lacunas) or\nconceptual inadequacy (i.e. lack of concepts with the appropriate\nconnotations), but also in cases where there is a rich conceptual\nrepertoire but taboos or other social practices prevent marginalized\nsubjects from discussing some matters of interest to them. Therefore,\nhe argues, \u201cwe require access to an expressively free\nenvironment in which to put these concepts to work: an open and\nreceptive social context in which a particular experience that\nindividuals or groups have a significant interest in coming to\nunderstand can be discussed in hermeneutically conducive ways\u201d\n(2016: 205).\n2.5 Generics\n\nGeneric statements are ones such as \u201ccats are furry\u201d, or\n\u201ca cat has fur\u201d, which are neither universal\ngeneralizations (there are furless cats) nor existential\ngeneralization (the claim being made is clearly stronger). They give\nrise to many puzzles, which have for some time interested both\nlinguists and philosophers. For a fuller discussion of generics, see\n the entry on generics.\n Our focus here is the social and political import that has recently\nbeen suggested for generic statements about social groups, on which\nthere is a growing literature. This literature takes as its starting\npoint Sarah-Jane Leslie\u2019s work (Leslie 2015; Wodak, Leslie, and\nRhodes 2015). Of key interest here are examples such as \u201cboys\ndon\u2019t cry\u201d or \u201cwomen place their families before\ntheir careers\u201d. These sentences can be used to express merely\ndescriptive claims\u2014describing, for example, crying as something\nnot that many boys do. But they can also be used to make normative\nclaims about what boys or women should do. Wodak, Leslie, and\nRhodes (2015) suggest that \u201cwe can understand the difference\nbetween normative and descriptive generics in terms of the different\nconcepts picked out by the noun phrase in the generics\nthemselves\u201d (Wodak et. al. 2015: 629). \u2018Woman\u2019 may\npick out a normative concept\u2014an ideal, which might include such\nthings as a focus on family over career; or, alternatively, it may\npick out a descriptive concept, and refer to women regardless of\nwhether they focus on family over career. Leslie uses this as a\nfoundation for explaining utterances like \u201cHillary Clinton is\nthe only man in the Obama White House\u201d, suggesting that\n\u2018man\u2019 here refers to the ideal of manliness. It is also a\npart of a more general project of arguing that generic utterances have\nharmful effects on social cognition. Leslie (forthcoming) also\ndiscusses what she calls \u201cstriking property generics\u201d,\nstatements that attribute dangerous properties to groups generically\nspecified\u2014like \u201cblack people are dangerous\u201d or\n\u201cMuslims are terrorists\u201d. She argues that striking\nproperty generic claims may not require many instances to be accepted\nas true (assuming some other conditions are also met) allowing them to\nserve as a key mechanism in perpetuating and exacerbating prejudice.\n(For some criticisms of Leslie on striking property generics, see Saul\nforthcoming and Sterken 2015a,b.)\n\nHaslanger (2011) has built on Leslie\u2019s work, arguing that\ngeneric claims often carry conversational implicatures about natures,\nand that these help them to serve as a key mechanism for perpetuating\nthe ideologies that hold unjust social structures in place. She\nsuggests that\u2014whatever their truth conditions (one understanding\nof Leslie\u2019s view would make striking property generic claims\nvery easily true)\u2014one should deny them via the mechanism of\nmeta-linguistic negation (Horn 1985) which allows the denial of a\nclaim because it carries a false implicature. By this method, we can\nstart to disrupt the ideologies that have us in their grip. (For\ncriticism of this, see Saul forthcoming).",
