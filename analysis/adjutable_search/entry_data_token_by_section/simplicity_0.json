    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThere is a widespread philosophical presumption that simplicity is a\ntheoretical virtue. This presumption that simpler theories are\npreferable appears in many guises. Often it remains implicit;\nsometimes it is invoked as a primitive, self-evident proposition;\nother times it is elevated to the status of a \u2018Principle\u2019\nand labeled as such (for example, the \u2018Principle of\nParsimony\u2019). However, it is perhaps best known by the name\n\u2018Occam\u2019s (or Ockham\u2019s) Razor.\u2019 Simplicity principles have\nbeen proposed in various forms by theologians, philosophers, and\nscientists, from ancient through medieval to modern times. Thus\nAristotle writes in his Posterior Analytics,\n\nWe may assume the superiority ceteris paribus of the\ndemonstration which derives from fewer postulates or\nhypotheses. (Posterior Analytics, p. 150)\n \n\nMoving to the medieval period, Aquinas writes:\n\nIf a thing can be done adequately by means of one, it is superfluous\nto do it by means of several; for we observe that nature does not\nemploy two instruments where one suffices (Aquinas, [BW], p. 129).\n\n\nKant\u2014in the Critique of Pure Reason\u2014supports the\nmaxim that \u201crudiments or principles must not be unnecessarily\nmultiplied (entia praeter necessitatem non esse\nmultiplicanda)\u201d and argues that this is a regulative idea\nof pure reason which underlies scientists\u2019 theorizing about nature\n(Kant, 1781/1787, pp. 538\u20139). Both Galileo and Newton accepted\nversions of Occam\u2019s Razor. Indeed Newton includes a principle of\nparsimony as one of his three \u2018Rules of Reasoning in\nPhilosophy\u2019 at the beginning of Book III of Principia\nMathematica (1687):\n\nRule I: We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as\nare both true and sufficient to explain their appearances.\n\n\nNewton goes on to remark that \u201cNature is pleased with\nsimplicity, and affects not the pomp of superfluous causes\u201d\n(Newton 1687, p. 398). Galileo, in the course of making a detailed\ncomparison of the Ptolemaic and Copernican models of the solar system,\nmaintains that \u201cNature does not multiply things unnecessarily;\nthat she makes use of the easiest and simplest means for producing her\neffects; that she does nothing in vain, and the like\u201d (Galileo\n1632, p. 397). Nor are scientific advocates of simplicity principles\nrestricted to the ranks of physicists and astronomers. Here is the\nchemist Lavoisier writing in the late 18th Century\n\nIf all of chemistry can be explained in a satisfactory manner without\nthe help of phlogiston, that is enough to render it infinitely likely\nthat the principle does not exist, that it is a hypothetical\nsubstance, a gratuitous supposition. It is, after all, a principle of\nlogic not to multiply entities unnecessarily (Lavoisier 1862, pp.\n623\u20134).\n\n\nCompare this to the following passage from Einstein, writing 150 years\nlater.\n\n[T]he grand aim of all science\u2026is to cover the greatest\npossible number of empirical facts by logical deductions from the\nsmallest possible number of hypotheses or axioms (Einstein, quoted in\nNash 1963, p. 173).\n\n\nEditors of a\u00a0volume on simplicity sent out surveys to 25 recent\nNobel laureates in economics. Almost all replied that simplicity\nplayed a role in their research, and that simplicity is a desirable\nfeature of economic theories (Zellner et al. 2001, p.2). Riesch (2010)\ninterviewed 40 scientists and found a range of attitudes towards the\nnature and role of simplicity principles in science.\n\nWithin philosophy, Occam\u2019s Razor (OR) is often wielded against\nmetaphysical theories which involve allegedly superfluous ontological\napparatus. Thus materialists about the mind may use OR against\ndualism, on the grounds that dualism postulates an extra ontological\ncategory for mental phenomena. Similarly, nominalists about abstract\nobjects may use OR against their platonist opponents, taking them to\ntask for committing to an uncountably vast realm of abstract\nmathematical entities. The aim of appeals to simplicity in such\ncontexts seem to be more about shifting the burden of proof, and less\nabout refuting the less simple theory outright.\n\nThe philosophical issues surrounding the notion of simplicity are\nnumerous and somewhat tangled. The topic has been studied in piecemeal\nfashion by scientists, philosophers, and statisticians (though for an\ninvaluable book-length philosophical treatment see Sober 2015). The\napparent familiarity of the notion of simplicity means that it is\noften left unanalyzed, while its vagueness and multiplicity of\nmeanings contributes to the challenge of pinning the notion down\n precisely.[1]\n A distinction is often made between two fundamentally distinct senses\nof simplicity: syntactic simplicity (roughly, the number and\ncomplexity of hypotheses), and ontological simplicity (roughly, the\nnumber and complexity of things\n postulated).[2]\n These two facets of simplicity are often referred to as\nelegance and parsimony respectively. For the\npurposes of the present overview we shall follow this usage and\nreserve \u2018parsimony\u2019 specifically for simplicity in the\nontological sense. It should be noted, however, that the terms\n\u2018parsimony\u2019 and \u2018simplicity\u2019 are used\nvirtually interchangeably in much of the philosophical literature.\n\nPhilosophical interest in these two notions of simplicity may be\norganized around answers to three basic questions;\n\n(i)\nHow is simplicity to be defined? [Definition]\n(ii)\nWhat is the role of simplicity principles in different areas of\ninquiry? [Usage]\n(iii)\nIs there a rational justification for such simplicity principles?\n[Justification]\n\n\nAs we shall see, answering the definitional question, (i), is more\nstraightforward for parsimony than for elegance. Conversely, more\nprogress on the issue, (iii), of rational justification has been made\nfor elegance than for parsimony. It should also be noted that the\nabove questions can be raised for simplicity principles both within\nphilosophy itself and in application to other areas of theorizing,\nespecially empirical science.\n\nWith respect to question (ii), there is an important distinction to be\nmade between two sorts of simplicity principle. Occam\u2019s Razor may be\nformulated as an epistemic principle: if theory \\(T\\) is\nsimpler than theory \\(T^*\\), then it is rational (other things\nbeing equal) to believe \\(T\\) rather than \\(T^*\\). Or it may\nbe formulated as a methodological principle: if \\(T\\) is\nsimpler than \\(T^*\\) then it is rational to adopt \\(T\\) as\none\u2019s working theory for scientific purposes. These two conceptions of\nOccam\u2019s Razor require different sorts of justification in answer to\nquestion (iii).\n\nIn analyzing simplicity, it can be difficult to keep its two\nfacets\u2014elegance and parsimony\u2014apart. Principles such as\nOccam\u2019s Razor are frequently stated in a way which is ambiguous\nbetween the two notions, for example, \u201cDon\u2019t multiply\npostulations beyond necessity.\u201d Here it is unclear whether\n\u2018postulation\u2019 refers to the entities being postulated, or\nthe hypotheses which are doing the postulating, or both. The first\nreading corresponds to parsimony, the second to elegance. Examples of\nboth sorts of simplicity principle can be found in the quotations\ngiven earlier in this section.\n\nWhile these two facets of simplicity are frequently conflated, it is\nimportant to treat them as distinct. One reason for doing so is that\nconsiderations of parsimony and of elegance typically pull in\ndifferent directions. Postulating extra entities may allow a theory to\nbe formulated more simply, while reducing the ontology of a theory may\nonly be possible at the price of making it syntactically more complex.\nFor example the postulation of Neptune, at the time not directly\nobservable, allowed the perturbations in the orbits of other observed\nplanets to be explained without complicating the laws of celestial\nmechanics. There is typically a trade-off between ontology and\nideology\u2014to use the terminology favored by Quine\u2014in which\ncontraction in one domain requires expansion in the other. This points\nto another way of characterizing the elegance/parsimony distinction,\nin terms of simplicity of theory versus simplicity of world\n respectively.[3]\n Sober (2001) argues that both these facets of simplicity can be\ninterpreted in terms of minimization. In the (atypical) case of\ntheoretically idle entities, both forms of minimization pull in the\nsame direction; postulating the existence of such entities makes both\nour theories (of the world) and the world (as represented by our\ntheories) less simple than they might be.\n",
