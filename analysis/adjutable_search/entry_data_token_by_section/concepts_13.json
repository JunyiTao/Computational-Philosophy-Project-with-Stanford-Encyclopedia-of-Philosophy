    "main_text": "Empiricism and nativism about concepts || Nativism about concepts\n3.3 Nativism about concepts\n\nPerhaps the most influential discussion of concepts in relation to the\nnativism/empiricism debate is Jerry Fodor\u2019s (1975, 1981)\nargument for the claim that virtually all lexical concepts are innate.\nFodor (1975) argued that there are theoretical problems with all\nmodels of concept learning in that all such models treat concept\nlearning as hypothesis testing. The problem is that the correct\nhypothesis invariably employs the very concept to be learned and hence\nthe concept has to be available to a learner prior to the learning\ntaking place. In his (1981), Fodor developed this argument by allowing\nthat complex concepts (and only complex concepts) can be learned in\nthat they can be assembled from their constituents during the learning\nprocess. He went on to argue that lexical concepts lack semantic\nstructure and consequently that virtually all lexical concepts must be\ninnate\u2014a position known as radical concept nativism.\nFodor\u2019s arguments have had a great deal of influence on debates\nabout nativism and concept learning, especially amongst cognitive\nscientists. Few if any have endorsed Fodor\u2019s radical\nconclusions, but many have shaped their views of cognitive development\nat least in part in response to Fodor\u2019s arguments (Jackendoff\n1989, Levin & Pinker 1991, Spelke & Tsivkin 2001, Carey 2009).\nAnd Fodor has convinced many that primitive concepts are in principle\nunlearnable (see, e.g., Pinker 2007). Fodor\u2019s arguments for this\nconclusion, however, can be challenged in a number of ways. The most\ndirect way to challenge it is to construct an account of what it is to\nlearn a primitive concept and to show that it is immune to\nFodor\u2019s challenges (Margolis 1998, Laurence & Margolis 2002,\nCarey 2009).\n\nFodor himself changed his view about these issues when he revisited\nthem in Fodor (2008). He now maintains that while considerations about\nthe need for hypothesis testing show that no concepts can be learned,\nnot even complex concepts, this does not require concepts to be innate\n(Fodor 2008). Instead, Fodor suggests that they are largely acquired\nvia processes that are merely biological in that they don\u2019t\nadmit of a psychological-level description. Though such a\n\u201cbiological\u201d account of concept acquisition does offer an\nalternative to the innate/learned dichotomy, there are reasons for\nsupposing that many concepts are learned all the same (Margolis &\nLaurence 2011). These include the fact that a person\u2019s\nconceptual system is highly sensitive to the surrounding culture. For\nexample, the concept PURGATORY comes from cultural products such as\nbooks, stories, and sermons. But clearly these can only succeed in\nconveying the concept when mediated by the right sort of psychological\nprocesses. Acquiring such concepts is a cognitive-level achievement,\nnot a merely biological one.\n\nAlthough much of the philosophical discussion of concept nativism has\nfocused on Fodor\u2019s radical concept nativism, it is important to\nnote that other less radical approaches to the origins of concepts\nexist and that these other approaches embrace a fair amount of\nlearning\u2014they just hold that much of this learning is structured\nby innate special-purpose acquisition systems (for example, Gallistel\n1990, Keil 1989, Spelke & Newport 1998, Baillargeon 2008, Carey 2009,\nMargolis & Laurence 2013, Tooby & Cosmides 2016).\n\nOne further issue concerning innate concepts that is in dispute is\nwhether the very idea of innateness makes sense. A common point among\nthose who are skeptical of the notion is the observation that all\ntraits are dependent upon interactions between genes and the\nenvironment and that there is no way to fully untangle the two (Elman\net al. 1996, Griffiths 2002; see also Clark 1998 and Marcus 2004, and\nthe entry on the\n distinction between innate and acquired characteristics).\n Nonetheless, there are clear differences between models of the mind\nwith empiricist leanings and models of the mind with nativist\nleanings, and the notion of innateness may be thought to earn its\nusefulness by marking these differences (Margolis & Laurence\n(2013). For discussion of different proposals of what innateness is\nsee Ariew (1999), Cowie (1999), Samuels (2002), Mallon & Weinberg\n(2006), Mameli (2008) and Khalidi (2015).\n",
