    "main_text": "Creativity and Artificial Intelligence\n7. Conclusion\n\nIt should be clear from the above discussions that there are rich and\nlively research programs, across a range of scientific disciplines,\nstudying human creativity. These approaches substantiate the view\nthat, contrary to the romantic tradition, creativity can be explained.\nPsychological functions and neural correlates have been identified,\nand remarkable advances are being made with computational and robotics\ntechnologies. What may be less clear is that, despite these advances,\nthe distinct research programs in question are largely disjoint or\nsiloed.\n\nIn a recent paper, Geraint Wiggins and Joydeep Bhattacharya (2014)\nhighlight this \u201cgap\u201d between scientific studies of\ncreativity. Their particular emphasis is on the gaps between research\nin neuroscience and research in computer science, and they advocate a\nbridge in the form of a neurocomputational approach. This kind of\nbridging may be called for even beyond what these authors prescribe,\nsince there are gaps not just between these disciplines, but also\nbetween these and behavioral psychology, AI and A-Life research, and\nphilosophical analysis. Creativity is a deeply complex and deeply\nimportant phenomenon. Fully understanding it will require us to\nintegrate a variety of theoretical perspectives, and, as this survey\nreveals, philosophy has a vital role to play in that endeavor.\n",
