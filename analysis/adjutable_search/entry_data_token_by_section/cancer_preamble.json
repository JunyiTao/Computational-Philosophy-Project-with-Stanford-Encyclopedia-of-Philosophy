    "main_text": "\n\nCancer is a major health problem worldwide; it is a leading cause of\ndeath, and with few exceptions, there have been steady increases in\nincidence and mortality (WHO, 2020). Perhaps not surprisingly, then,\ncancer is a central topic of biomedical research, drawing billions of\ndollars annually. In 2019, the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI)\nallocated $5.74 billion in federal dollars, a $79 million increase\nover 2018 (NCI, 2019\u2014see the Other Internet Resources). A search\nfor the term \u201ccancer\u201d in PubMed returns over three million\nhits.\n\nDespite this, cancer\u2014and scientific research on cancer\u2014has\nreceived relatively little attention from philosophers of science.\nHowever, this is starting to change. Recent work by philosophers of\nscience has made substantial contributions to addressing conceptual\nand methodological issues that arise in cancer science and medicine\n(Pradeu, et. al., 2023). This entry will focus on four such\nissues.\n\nFirst, scientific classifications of cancer have as yet failed to\nyield a unified taxonomy. There is a diversity of classificatory\nschemes for cancer, and while some are hierarchical or nested, others\nappear to be \u201ccross-cutting.\u201d Initially, researchers\nturned to genomics in hopes that such issues might be resolved by\nmolecular \u201csubtyping\u201d. However, genomic sequencing and its\nsequelae\u2014transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics,\netc.\u2014have, if anything, complicated cancer classification. This\nliterature thus raises a variety of questions about both the nature of\nthe disease and disease classification: Are there some classifications\nthat are more useful, or better than others? What makes a\nclassification a good one? What does it mean to track more or less\n\u201cnatural\u201d distinctions in the context of disease? The\nproblem of cancer classification is complicated by the fact that\ncancer progression is a process with a complex natural history. Thus,\ncancer serves as a challenging case not only for disease\nclassification, but also for demarcating disease from health.\n\nSecond, many assume that the aim of science is to arrive at true\ntheories, from which one may generate predictions and explanations.\nHowever, scientists studying cancer seem to have a variety of\ndifferent practical and scientific aims, and the practical aims seem\nto receive far more attention than theoretical ones. Perhaps it is not\nsurprising, then, that historians and philosophers of science do not\nseem to agree on how best to characterize the aims, let alone agree on\nhow best to assess \u201cprogress\u201d in cancer research. With the\nrise of \u201cbig data\u201d science, both philosophers and\nhistorians of science are rethinking how best to describe and explain\nthese distinctive kinds of scientific inquiry.\n\nThird, cancer is in part a byproduct of our developmental and life\nhistory, as well as our evolutionary history. Cancer\u2019s emergence\nand progression has been compared to a reversion of development, and\nto the evolution of multicellularity. Thus, cancer raises intriguing\nquestions about how we conceive of \u201cfunctions,\u201d\n\u201cdevelopment,\u201d and the role of our evolutionary history\nand particularly, selective trade-offs, in vulnerability to\ndisease.\n\nLast but not least, cancer research provides a case study for\nconsideration of the roles of values in science, and at the\nscience-policy interface. Epidemiological and toxicological research\non cancer\u2019s causes informs law and regulatory policy. Cancer\nresearch also provides a test case for debates about the challenges\nfacing precision medicine; in particular, the complexity and\nheterogeneity of cancer makes translating \u201cbasic\u201d science\ninto the \u201creal world\u201d enormously difficult. This does not\nexhaust the variety of conceptual and methodological questions that\narise in cancer science. Philosophical work on cancer is increasingly\nbrought into conversation with debates of general philosophical\ninterest over causation, risk, chance, choice, and moral\nresponsibility.\n",
