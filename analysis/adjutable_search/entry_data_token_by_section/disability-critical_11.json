    "main_text": "Activism\n5. Conclusion\n\nCritical disability theory is a diverse set of approaches that largely\nseek to theorize disability as a cultural, political, and social\nphenomenon, rather than an individualized, medical matter attached to\nthe body. In this way, it shares goals with traditional disability\nstudies. But, additionally, critical disability theory actively seeks\nalliances and has produced work in conversation with other key areas\nof critical thought: critical race theory, postcolonial theory, queer\ntheory, and Continental philosophy, among other strategies. It also\nreflexively considers the exclusions, framing, and normative\npresuppositions of disability studies, favoring intersectional\napproaches and expansive inclusion. Critical disability theory\npresumes that those persons to whom the label \u201cdisability\u201d\nattaches share in overlapping and intensifying oppressions with\npathologized and devalued persons in circumstances not readily\nrecognized as \u201cdisabled\u201d (Minich 2016). As Schalk puts it,\n\n\n\nOne can study disabled people and not be doing critical disability\nstudies and one can be doing critical disability studies and not be\ndirectly studying disabled people. (2017) \n\n\nIn this way, critical disability theory is interested, too, in topics\nnot readily recognized as of concern for disability studies, including\n(for example): \n\n\nprotests against racialized disparities in health, education, and\npolicing; struggles for environmental justice and reproductive\nfreedom; HIV/AIDS and fat activism; the writings of Audre Lorde on\nblindness and cancer and of Gloria Anzald\u00faa on early\nmenstruation and diabetes. (Minich 2016)\n\n\nAs demonstrated here, critical disability theory is a developing\ndiscipline with blurry boundaries and actively emerging new work.\nIndeed, some suggest that offering a literature review of work in this\narea is premature (Dunhamn et al., 2015; Meekosha & Shuttleworth\n2009: 48). This entry nevertheless outlines work currently occurring\nunder the umbrella of critical disability theory, its signature\napproaches, and key debates. There is room here for the significant\nshifts in terminology and attention to new topics one should expect\nfrom this politically responsive and intersectional field actively\ndeveloping coalitions across boundaries. Difficulties emerge, too,\nincluding what Nirmala Erevelles calls the \u201ccomplex cultural\npriorities\u201d of such an enterprise. As she puts it, these\n\u201ccomplex cultural priorities\u201d include \n\n\nthe range of disability conditions (e.g., neurological, psychological,\nphysical, cognitive) that the field of disability studies purports to\nrepresent in addition to the diversity of the disabled community\naround the axes of race, class, gender, and sexuality. (Erevelles\n& Kafer 2010: 212) \n\n\nTheorists explicitly invite conversations about future directions of\ncritical disability theory (e.g., Minich 2016).\n",
