    "main_text": "\n\nIn the logic of belief revision (belief change), a belief state (or\ndatabase) is represented by a set of sentences. The major operations\nof change are those consisting in the introduction or removal of a\nbelief-representing sentence. In both cases, changes affecting other\nsentences may be needed (for instance in order to retain consistency).\nRationality postulates for such operations have been proposed, and\nrepresentation theorems have been obtained that characterize specific\ntypes of operations in terms of these postulates.\n\nIn the dominant theory of belief revision, the so-called AGM model,\nthe set representing the belief state is assumed to be a logically\nclosed set of sentences (a belief set). One of most debated\ntopics in belief revision theory is the recovery postulate, according\nto which all the original beliefs are regained if one of them is first\nremoved and then reinserted. The recovery postulate holds in the AGM\nmodel but not in closely related models employing belief bases.\nAnother much discussed topic is how repeated changes can be adequately\nrepresented. Several alternative models have been proposed that are\nintended to provide a more realistic account of belief change than\nthat offered by the AGM model. \n",
