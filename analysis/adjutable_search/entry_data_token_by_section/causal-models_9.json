    "main_text": "Probabilistic Causal Models\n4. Probabilistic Causal Models\n\nIn this section, we will discuss causal models that incorporate\nprobability in some way. Probability may be used to represent our\nuncertainty about the value of unobserved variables in a particular\ncase, or the distribution of variable values in a population. Often we\nare interested in when some feature of the causal structure of a\nsystem can be identified from the probability distribution\nover values of variables, perhaps in conjunction with background\nassumptions and other observations. For example, we may know the\nprobability distribution over a set of variables \\(\\bV\\), and want to\nknow which causal structures over the variables in \\(\\bV\\) are\ncompatible with the distribution. In realistic scientific cases, we\nnever directly observe the true probability distribution P over a set\nof variables. Rather, we observe finite data that approximate the true\nprobability when sample sizes are large enough and observation\nprotocols are well-designed. We will not address these important\npractical concerns here. Rather, our focus will be on what it is\npossible to infer from probabilities, in principle if not in practice.\nWe will also consider the application of probabilistic causal models\nto decision theory and counterfactuals.\n",
