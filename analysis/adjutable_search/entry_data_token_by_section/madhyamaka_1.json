    "main_text": "\u0100ryadeva (fl. ca. 225\u2013250 C.E.)\n2. \u0100ryadeva (fl. ca. 225\u2013250 C.E.)\n\nAccording to traditional accounts preserved in Tibetan and Chinese,\n\u0100ryadeva was born into the royal family in what is now Sri Lanka,\nrenounced his claim to the throne, took monastic vows, studied the\nBuddhist scriptures for several years, and travelled to south India.\nHe reportedly became a direct disciple of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna. His\nprincipal writing, the Catu\u1e25\u015bataka\u015b\u0101stra\n(Four Hundred Verse Treatise), was regarded as a Madhayamaka text and\nwas commented on by Candrak\u012brti and by prominent Tibetan\nproponents of the Madhyamaka school.\n\nThe first hundred verses of the Four Hundred Verse Treatise deal with\nfour illusions that must be dispelled by someone striving to achieve\nliberation from the root causes of dissatisfaction. The four illusions\nare the beliefs that there are permanent things in the world that\nescape destruction, that impermanent things can provide true\nsatisfaction, that satisfaction can be derived from intrinsically\nimpure things, and that satisfaction can be attained by being\npreoccupied with oneself. These are standard themes in Buddhist\nwritings. The second set of one hundred verses also deal with standard\nBuddhist themes, namely, cultivating altruistic motivations, ridding\nthe mind of the afflictions of desire, anger, and delusion, and\ndeveloping habits of ethical conduct. While the first half of the\ntreatise is essentially inspirational in nature, the second half\nprovides arguments meant to prove that all things are conditioned and\ntherefore impermanent, that nothing qualifies as an independent and\nenduring self, and that there are no uncaused causes. Most of the\nverses dealing with these topics are polemical in nature and are aimed\nat refuting the doctrines of Brahmanical schools, Jainism and some of\nthe Buddhist scholastics. As is the case with other M\u0101dhyamikas,\n\u0100ryadeva focuses most of his attention on showing the\nincomprehensibility or absurdity of the doctrines under review. His\nmotivation for doing this is suggested in 8.10 (the tenth verse in the\neighth set of twenty-five), where he says attachment to one\u2019s\nown views and disparaging the views of others is an obstacle to\nnirvana, and tranquillity is impossible for those who engage in\ndoctrinal disputes. His exercise in showing the untenability of\nvarious positions, then, is presumably done not for the sake of\nrefuting others in order to establish his own position, but to help\nhis readers break the habit of firmly holding tenets.\n\nAn example of \u0100ryadeva\u2019s demonstrating an inconsistency in\na particular position is his critique of the view that there is a\npermanent self. He observes that since a permanent self could not\nundergo change, it could not be harmed or destroyed, and therefore it\nis inconsistent for those who believe in such a self to promote\nethical guidelines against killing or harming others. While\n\u0100ryadeva endeavors in some chapters to show the inconsistencies\nin a number of particular doctrines of the S\u0101\u1e43khya and\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika schools, in the fourteenth chapter he provides a\nparadigm of an argument that can be applied to any number of doctrinal\npositions. That paradigm, which is familiar to readers of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna and other M\u0101dhyamikas, consists in showing\nthat there is a problem in attributing a given predicate to a subject,\nand in attributing the negation of that predicate, and in attributing\nboth the predicate and its negation, and in attributing neither the\npredicate nor its negation. For example, he argues that one cannot say\nthat a pot is single, for it has many characteristics, such as color,\nshape, hardness, odor and so forth. It also cannot be said that the\npot is many pots, because none of the individual characteristics is a\npot. It cannot be said that the pot is a single whole with many\ncharacteristics, because some of its components are material and\ntherefore capable of contact and location, while others, such as color\nand odor, are immaterial and have no location; it makes no sense to\nsay that characteristics that have contrary natures form a coherent\nwhole. And yet to deny that a pot is either one or many is to deny\nthat it exists at all, for an existent thing must have either a\nproperty or the absence of that property. \u0100ryadeva\u2019s\nstatements of these arguments in verse is laconic and often difficult\nto follow; therefore, most readers who study his text do so with the\nhelp of one of the many commentaries written by later Sanskrit or\nTibetan authors. \n",
