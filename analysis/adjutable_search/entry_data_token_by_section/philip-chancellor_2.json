    "main_text": "Philip\u2019s Philosophical Significance\n3. Philip\u2019s Philosophical Significance\n\n\nIn his major philosophical work, Summa de bono, Philip uses\nthe notion of the good as an organizing principle for his study. He\ndivides the text roughly into four sections. Philip discusses first\nthe nature of good in general terms, and then the highest good and its\nrelationship to created goods. After this rather short introduction to\nthe notion of the good, Philip goes on to examine in some depth the\nvarious sorts of created goods. He divides his discussion of created\ngoods into three parts. First, he looks at the good retained by\ncreatures by virtue of their natures (bonum naturae). In\nturn, these goods fall into two categories: those goods that cannot be\ndiminished by evil and those goods that can be lost through evil. In\nhis discussion of the former, Philip focuses first on the angels and\ntheir properties, and then on human beings and their properties. Those\ngoods that can be affected by evil are discussed in conjunction with\nAdam\u2019s fall from grace in the Garden and its\nconsequences. Following the discussion of bonum naturae,\nPhilip considers what he calls bonum in genere. Although this\nsort of good has a rather peculiar title, the bonum in genere\nrepresents goods that come about as a result of an agent\u2019s\nactions. These goods have this title because what determines whether a\ngiven act is good depends not only on the sort of act it is (its\n\u201cform\u201d so to speak) but also what the act has to do with\n(its \u201cmatter\u201d so to speak), thus suggesting that these\nsorts of goods can be classified along the lines of genera and\nspecies.  Moreover, these sorts of generic goods contrast with the\nmeritorious goods brought about as the result of God\u2019s\ngrace. After discussing the\nbonum in genere, Philip goes on to look at the good that is\nassociated with grace. Here, he divides his treatment into the graces\nthat pertain to angels (as well as their ministries) and the graces\nthat pertain to human beings. Philip includes the virtues in his\ndiscussion of human graces. Although he denies that the virtues are a\ntype of grace, he includes them in this section because virtues come\nabout as a result of grace working within human beings. This idea is\nmost naturally associated with the theological virtues of faith, hope,\nand charity, and indeed, Philip discusses these virtues here at some\nlength. But he also includes in this section a lengthy discussion of\nthe cardinal virtues: prudence, fortitude, temperance (and the\nassociated virtues of modesty, sobriety, continence, and virginity),\nand justice, virtues which one might argue have no direct connection\nwith grace. Philip admits that strictly speaking cardinal virtues are\nnot divine virtues since they have to do with what is for the sake of\nthe end and not directly with the end itself (the end of course being\nGod). But he argues that justice has to do both with God and with human\ngovernance; perhaps because of this connection, he felt justified\nin including them in a broader discussion of grace.  Philip ends his\nwork with another source of grace, the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit.\nHis discussion of the good of grace in human beings occupies over\nhalf of Summa de bono with his unit on the virtues accounting\nfor a large portion of this section. \n\n\nPhilip\u2019s Summa de bono represents a significant innovation\nin medieval philosophical work. His use of the good as an organizing\nprinciple is a departure from the explicitly theological structure of\nother well-known texts of the time including Peter Lombard\u2019s\nSentences and William of Auxerre\u2019s Summa\naurea.  Philip is certainly concerned with theological issues;\nAertsen points out that in the prologue, Philip explicitly mentions\nthe need to provide a philosophical response to the Manichean heresy\nas part of his justification in developing an account of the good\n(Aertsen 2012). It is also true that Philip discusses the difference\nbetween God\u2019s goodness and created goodness. Nevertheless, these\ntheological notions do not provide the intellectual framework for\nPhilip\u2019s discussion. Unlike the\nSentences or Summa aurea, Philip devotes no\nsignificant sections of his work to topics such as God\u2019s nature, the\nIncarnation, or the sacraments. Whereas often William\u2019s or\nLombard\u2019s examination of a philosophical issue arises in the context of\na larger theological issue, this is not generally the case for Philip. For\nexample, in William\u2019s Summa aurea, the issues of human action\nand its freedom arise within a discussion of Adam\u2019s fall in the Garden.\nWilliam raises these issues here because he recognizes that holding\nAdam responsible for his sin requires that Adam acted freely. Philip\nplaces his treatment of free action within an examination of human\npsychology. It is not until after he discusses the character and\nthe powers of the human soul that he gets around to examining\ntheological issues such as the origin and the immortality of the soul.\nPhilip is one of the first major thinkers in the Latin West whose\nwork reflects the influence of the recent influx of newly translated\ntexts from Aristotle and his Arabic commentators, particularly in the\narea of metaphysics. This helps to explain the distinctive character\nof his work (see MacDonald 1992). His use of Aristotelian metaphysics\nis especially interesting given that many of Aristotle\u2019s\nmetaphysical treatises and work in natural philosophy were officially\nbanned at Paris during the time that he was working on Summa de\nbono. Philip\u2019s text greatly influenced that of his\ncontemporaries and successors, including Albertus Magnus, Alexander of\nHales, and even Thomas Aquinas (see MacDonald 1992, Houser 2004,\nLottin 1957).\n",
