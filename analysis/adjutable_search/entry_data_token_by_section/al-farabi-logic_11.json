    "main_text": "Tools for Inference || Demonstrative Logic\n6.4 Demonstrative Logic\n\nWe saw in\n Section 3\n above that al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b believed Aristotle had prescribed\nuniversal rules for demonstrative reasoning in his Posterior\nAnalytics. But apart from some discussion of techniques for\nfinding definitions, the only rules that al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\noffers us in [Demonstration] are categorical syllogisms in\nmood Barbara with extra pieces clamped on. (These are in the\nsection [Demonstration] 33.1\u201339.4; they are quoted in\nStrobino 2019.)\n\nThis is disappointing, but at least it\u2019s clear where the extra\npieces come from. Demonstrative reasoning gives knowledge with\ncertainty, and in [Certainty] al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b writes\ndown some necessary and sufficient conditions for certainty. (These\n\u201cconditions of certainty\u201d are listed by\nL\u00f3pez-Farjeat 2020 and discussed by Black 2006.) The condition\nthat is relevant here is the last one:\n\n\nIf the previous conditions hold, it is not accidental that they\ndo.\n\n\n([Certainty] 100.18.) In other words they hold by reason of\nessence. Also in a discussion of demonstration in\n[Attainment] 51.15\u201352.17 al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b tells\nus that demonstration must proceed from some primary concepts, and the\nconcepts in question are those that are answers to the questions\n\u201cwhat\u201d, \u201cby what\u201d, \u201chow\u201d,\n\u201cfrom what\u201d, and \u201cfor what\u201d. These are not\nexactly the questions listed in\n Section 4.2 above,\n but they are clearly in that territory. Again they indicate that a\ndemonstration should follow from the constitutive properties of the\nsubjects under discussion, i.e., from their essences. \n\nSuppose we have constitutive properties of A and B which\nbetween them ensure that every A is a B, and likewise\nconstitutive properties which ensure that every B is a\nC. Then by Barbara we know that every A is a\nC; but for demonstrative certainty we want \u201cEvery\nA is a C\u201d to be ensured by the constitutive\nproperties of A and C. Some of\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s syllogisms confirm that this is so,\nconsidering different kinds of constitutive\n property.[20]\n In some other cases the constitutive properties fail to yield the\nrequired sentences, and al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b comments that the\nsyllogism gives fact but not cause.\n\nGalston (1981) offers reasons for thinking that\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b may have considered demonstrative proofs a\ndistant ideal, to be reached only after a substantial amount of work\nat the dialectical\n level.[21]\n",
