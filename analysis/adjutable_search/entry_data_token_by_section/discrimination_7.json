Challenging the Concept of Indirect Discrimination\n\n\nThe distinction between direct and indirect discrimination plays a\ncentral role in contemporary thinking about discrimination.  However,\nsome philosophers hold that talking about indirect discrimination is\nconfused and misguided. For these philosophers, direct discrimination\nis the only genuine form of discrimination.  Examining their challenge\nto the very concept of indirect discrimination is crucial in\ndeveloping a philosophical account of what discrimination is.\n",
