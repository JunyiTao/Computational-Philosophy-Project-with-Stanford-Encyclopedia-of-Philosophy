K. Ogden and I. A. Richards (1923) and A. J. Ayer\n(1936) in the development of emotivism. Emotivism, a precursor to the\nmetaethical expressivism today championed by Simon Blackburn (1993,\n1998), Alan Gibbard (1990, 2003), and Michael Ridge (2014), among\nothers, is typically understood as a theory of moral language\naccording to which ethical sentences may be usefully compared to\nexclamative and imperative sentences (\u2018Hooray!\u2019, \u2018Be\nkind\u2019) in that they are used to express a speaker\u2019s affective or\nnoncognitive psychological states (such as approval or disapproval).\nThis contrasts with views according to which the primary use of such\nsentences would be to describe some action, person,\ninstitution, etc. Stevenson\u2019s emotivism, however, was more than a\ntheory of moral language, his account of moral language was but one\npart of a metaethical theory, grounded in moral and linguistic\npsychology. It was intended to clarify the nature and structure of\na whole range of normative problems common to everyday\nlife\u2014ethical, aesthetic, political, etc.\u2014as well as the\nmethods typically used to resolve them.\n", "toc": [{"#LifWor": "1.

Life and Work\n\nC. L. Stevenson was born in 1908 in Cincinnati, Ohio. In his youth, he\ndeveloped a life-long passion for literature and the arts, especially\npoetry and music, whose power to influence a person\u2019s emotions and\nactions fascinated him\u2014a fascination that would remain at the\ncenter of Stevenson\u2019s personal and professional life.\n\nIn 1926, Stevenson entered Yale University, earning a prize for best\nentrance examination for piano at the Yale School of Music. He\ngraduated from Yale in 1930 with a B.A. in English Literature, a field\nhe intended to pursue upon entering Cambridge University, England\nlater that year. While at Cambridge, however, Stevenson became\nincreasingly attracted to philosophy, in large part because of\nacquaintances with I. A. Richards, G. E. Moore, and Ludwig\nWittgenstein. Each of these figures produced important, and different,\nkinds of work on the nature, analysis, and use of language, had strong\npersonalities, and shared Stevenson\u2019s love for literature, arts, and\naesthetics. Stevenson earned his B.A. in Philosophy from Cambridge in\n1933 and entered Harvard that same year to earn his Ph.D. in Philosophy,\nwhich he received in 1935. While at Harvard, Stevenson worked closely\nwith Ralph Barton Perry, whose General Theory of Value\n(1926), conversant in early American pragmatism and early Continental\nphenomenology, had a lasting influence on Stevenson\u2019s work (Sartris\n1984; Warnock 1978).\n\nStevenson remained at Harvard as an instructor for three years until\n1938, during which time three early essays were published in\nMind: \u201cThe Emotive Meaning of Ethical Terms\u201d\n(1937), \u201cEthical Judgments and Avoidability\u201d (1938a), and\n\u201cPersuasive Definitions\u201d (1938b). In 1939, Stevenson\naccepted the position of Assistant Professor at Yale, where he\nremained until 1946, and during which time his landmark Ethics and\nLanguage was published in 1944. One of the conclusions Stevenson\nreached in this book was that some ethical disputes may be rationally\nirresolvable. Apparently on these grounds, and in the historical\ncontext of World War II atrocity, Stevenson was denied\n tenure.[1]\n The University of Michigan immediately offered Stevenson a position\nas Associate Professor, which he accepted, and where he remained until\n1978. Stevenson\u2019s most important articles in ethics are collected in\nFacts and Values (1963a), which also contains an informative\nretrospective essay (1963b) that clarifies, expands, and refines his\nmature views. His partly related work in aesthetics (e.g., 1950b,\n1957, 1958) remains uncollected.\n\nStevenson passed away in 1979 in Bennington, Vermont, where he had\nmoved to be near family and where he had accepted a position as\nProfessor of Philosophy at Bennington College. He was survived by his\nsecond wife Nora, whom he married in 1965, after the death, two years\nearlier, of his first wife, Louise. With Louise, Stevenson had three\nchildren, including acclaimed poet Anne Stevenson.\n2. Ethics and Psychology\n2.1 Ethics, Metaethics, and Moral Problems\n\nFor Stevenson, a field of study is demarcated by the kinds of problems\ninto which it inquires. Biology inquires into problems concerning\nlife; history inquires into problems concerning past social events and\ncultural developments; etc. Ethics inquires into ethical problems,\nproblems about what is good or bad, what ought to be done, how we\nought to feel about something, etc. Ethical problems are ubiquitous.\nThey are the \u201cproblems that are familiar in everyday\ndiscussions, and which range from idle bits of gossip about this or\nthat man\u2019s character to prolonged and serious discussions of\ninternational politics\u201d (1963a, v). Stevenson conceives of his\nwork as having \u201cfar less to say about the summum bonum\nof the philosophers than about the judgments of the ordinary\u201d\nperson as they finish \u201creading the morning\u2019s newspaper\u201d\n(1963a, v). He writes about his approach to the nature of moral\nproblems as follows:\n\n\nIt requires us to abstract from the detailed subject matter of the\nproblems and pay selective attention to the aspects of them that are\nmost likely to prod us into problem solving. It requires us\nto see these aspects not from a moral point of view (which would\nattend any attempt to settle the problems) but rather from\nthe point of view of an informal, common sense psychology. In effect,\nthen, it asks for a generic description, given in psychological terms,\nof those ethical doubts and uncertainties, or discords and\ndisagreements, that we often resolve by inquiry, deliberation, and\ndiscussion, but which on some occasions can lead us into an impasse,\nand on other occasions can induce us temporarily to suspend judgment,\nacknowledging that we are not yet in a position to come to a\ntrustworthy conclusion. (1963b, 186\u2013187)\n\n\nStevenson\u2019s aim was that of \u201csharpening the tools\u201d for the\n\u201clegislators, editorialists, didactic novelists, clergymen, and\nmoral philosophers\u201d addressing ethical (and other normative)\nquestions (1944,1). It is an interesting question how, precisely, the\nsharpened tools would help us in addressing such questions of\nnormative ethics (Stevenson doesn\u2019t say very much about this,\nbut see 1944, Ch. 15) Quite independently of this issue, though,\nStevenson\u2019s insights into how moral problems arise and are dealt with\nin our lives as social, communicative beings, are of seminal\nimportance to the development of metaethics.\n2.2 Disagreement in Belief and Disagreement in Attitude\n\nMoral problems can be interpersonal or personal. A moral problem is\ninterpersonal when there is disagreement among two or more people and\npersonal when an individual is uncertain about a moral issue. But what\nis the nature of this disagreement or uncertainty? These are\nthe questions around which Stevenson organizes all of his work in\nmetaethics and with which he begins both Ethics and Language\n(1944) and Facts and Values (1963a).\n\nInterpersonal disagreement is of two broad kinds: disagreement in\nbelief and disagreement in attitude. Very roughly, the\nidea is to distinguish between disagreement that involves opposed or\nincompatible beliefs and disagreement that involves opposed or\nincompatible attitudes: \u201cthe former is concerned with how\nmatters are truthfully to be described and explained; the latter is\nconcerned with how they are to be favored or disfavored, and hence\nwith how they are to be shaped by human efforts\u201d (1944, 4).\nStevenson\u2019s discussion of disagreement in attitude has been highly\ninfluential as a starting point for attempts to find an account of\ndisagreement that would suit non-cognitivist, expressivist, or\ncontextualist views in metaethics (see, e.g., Blackburn 1998, 69;\nGibbard 2003, 65\u201371; Dreier 2009; Ridge 2013; Toppinen 2013,\n272\u2013280; Finlay 2017).\n\nDisagreement in belief occurs when two people have beliefs that cannot\nboth be true and \u201cneither is content to let the belief of the\nother remain unchallenged\u201d (1948b, 1). If Smith believes that\ntheir and Jones\u2019s anniversary is in June, while Jones believes their\nanniversary is in July, their respective beliefs are incompatible,\nsince they cannot both be true; but Smith and Jones only disagree in\nthe sense that Stevenson mostly focuses on when they desire, need, or\nattempt to coordinate their beliefs, perhaps because they\nwould like to celebrate their anniversary as close to their wedding\ndate as possible. Their disagreement is resolved when they modify\ntheir beliefs in ways that make them compatible, or when both cease to\ncare about coordinating their incompatible beliefs.\n\nAnalogously, disagreement in attitude occurs when two or more people\nhave attitudes\u2014e.g., desires, plans, or intentions, or other\nstates whose general nature is that of being for or being\nagainst something (1948b, 2)\u2014that cannot all be jointly\nsatisfied (had, felt, etc.) and there is a desire, need, or attempt to\ncoordinate those attitudes. Importantly, disagreement in\nattitude is to be distinguished from disagreement about\nattitudes, which is a kind of disagreement in belief (1948b, 3;\nsee also 1944, 9\u201310). If Smith and Jones desire to dine\ntogether, but Smith desires to dine at a restaurant where there is\nmusic, while Jones desires to dine at a quiet restaurant, they\ndisagree, in a quite ordinary sense of the term, about where to dine\n(1944, 3). This kind of disagreement, as Stevenson notes,\n\u201csprings more from divergent preferences than from divergent\nbeliefs, and will end when they both wish to go the same place\u201d\n(1944, 3). For Stevenson, disagreement in attitude is a very common\nphenomenon:\n\n\nFurther examples are easily found. Mrs. A has social aspirations, and\nwants to move with the elite. Mr. A is easy-going, and loyal to his\nold friends. They accordingly disagree about what guests they will\ninvite to their party. The curator of the museum wants to buy pictures\nby contemporary artists; some of his advisors prefer the purchase of\nold masters. They disagree. John\u2019s mother is concerned about the\ndangers of playing football, and doesn\u2019t want him to play. John, even\nthough he agrees (in belief) about the dangers, wants to play anyhow.\nAgain, they disagree. (1944, 3)\n\n\nAgreement, Stevenson notes, may be dealt with \u201cmainly by\nimplication\u201d (1944, 2\u20135). The accounts of disagreement and\nagreement differ in that while two persons only disagree when they\nhave opposing beliefs or attitudes and when, moreover, at\nleast one party to the dispute \u201chas a motive for altering or\ncalling into question\u201d the belief or the attitude of the other,\ntheir agreement seems to be secured, on Stevenson\u2019s view, simply in\nvirtue of their having converging beliefs or attitudes (1944,\n4\u20135). People may \u201cneither agree nor disagree\u2014as will\nhappen when they are in a state of mutual indecision or\nirresolution,\u201d or when they simply differ,\n\u201chaving divergent beliefs or attitudes without a sufficient\nmotive for making them alike\u201d (1944, 4\u20135)\n\nRidge (2013, 41\u201345) contrasts Stevenson\u2019s account of\ndisagreement with what he calls a Stevensonian view. The\nformer demands that in order for two persons to disagree at least one\nmust be motivated to coordinate the relevant beliefs or attitudes,\nwhereas the latter only demands that the two persons have, roughly,\nbeliefs that cannot be jointly true or attitudes that cannot be\njointly satisfied. The former account of disagreement may seem\nimplausible. It seems that two persons may disagree, both in belief\nand in attitude, without even being aware of the existence of each\nother (Ridge 2013, 45\u201349). The latter option, the Stevensonian\nview\u2014which has been the more influential one in later\ndiscussions of the idea of a disagreement in attitude\u2014avoids\nthis problem (Ridge 2013, 41\u201343). However, Stevenson\u2019s view\nplausibly was the Stevensonian one. We may distinguish between\ndisagreement as a kind of activity\u2014having a\ndisagreement\u2014and disagreement as a state (Cappelen\n& Hawthorne 2009, 60\u201361). While two people who are not aware\nof the existence of each other may be in a state of disagreement, they\nwon\u2019t be engaged in having a disagreement. Plausibly, Stevenson is\noperating with a distinction along these lines, and simply wishes to\nfocus on disagreement in the sense of a kind of activity. This is\nunderstandable, given his focus on moral problems and on the\nways of dealing with such problems. So, when Stevenson contrasts\nmerely differing with having a disagreement (1944,\n4\u20135 and 111) the contrast is plausibly meant to capture the\ncontrast between merely being in a state of disagreement and having a\ndisagreement. He writes, for instance:\n\n\nThere are times, of course, when people differ in their attitudes\nwithout having a sufficient motive for resolving the difference. They\nmay feel that the difference will lead to no clash; they may be too\ntimid, too aloof, or too economical of their time to make an issue of\nthe matter; they may consider certain men too fixed in their ways to\nbe changed, and others capable of leading their own lives. (Stevenson\n1944, 111)\n\n\nClearly, in these sorts of cases, Stevenson sees the relevant people\nas disagreeing in an important sense, despite the fact that they see\nno point in engaging or in arguing with each other. Indeed,\nhe then goes on to point out that in certain kind of circumstances\n(e.g., when concerted social action is needed) the motives for\narguing in a way that \u201cmay change disagreement in\nattitude to agreement\u201d become manifold\u2014thus implicitly\napplying the notion of a disagreement in attitude also to a mere\nconflict of attitudes (1944, 112).\n\nStevenson does not assume that interpersonal disagreement always\nsignals that one is intending to get another to change their beliefs\nor attitudes, to win the argument as it were. It may, and often is,\nthe case that one is open to having their own beliefs or attitudes\nchanged in the course of open-minded discussion or deliberation. Thus\nneither disagreement in belief nor disagreement in attitude need be an\n\u201coccasion for forensic rivalry; it may be an occasion for an\ninterchange of aims, with a reciprocal influence that both parties\nfind to be beneficial\u201d (1944, 4\u20135).\n\nUncertainty in attitude occurs when an individual is\nuncertain about how to feel or about what to do. For example, Smith\nmay have conflicting attitudes about some particular legislation\nproposal (being in disagreement with themselves, so to speak).\nAlternatively, they may, while currently having no attitudes regarding\nthe proposal, wish to determine whether to be for or against it, so\nthat they can vote responsibly (1963b, 191\u2013199; 1950a,\n55\u201360). Stevenson doesn\u2019t say much about uncertainty in\nbelief, but it is, presumably, a matter of being disposed both to\nbelieve and to disbelieve some proposition, or of wanting to settle on\na belief regarding some issue.\n\nEspecially in Ethics and Language, Stevenson\u2019s focus is\nprimarily on interpersonal disagreement rather than on personal\nuncertainty, but this is not because he would have deemed the latter\nless important. Rather, he is supposing that personal uncertainty may\nbe usefully understood in terms of a person being in disagreement with\nthemselves (1944, 131). However, Stevenson later came to have some\nregrets over the lack of emphasis on personal deliberation and\nuncertainty, which, he thought, also contributed to a somewhat\nmisleading picture of interpersonal moral problems. In particular, he\ncame to worry that this emphasis made it easy to think of his theory\nas downplaying the difficulty of moral questions and the preparedness\nof people to revise their moral views, and contributed to the\nimpression that there would be \u201csomething more to ethics\u201d\nthan what Stevenson had been able to find (1963b, 186\u2013194).\n\nHow, then, is the crucial distinction between beliefs and attitudes to\nbe understood? Stevenson adopts a dispositional theory, according to\nwhich these states are distinguishable by their respective complex\ncausal relations (1944, 7\u20138; 1950a). (More will be said about\nStevenson\u2019s view of dispositions in\n Section 3.2.)\n While he concedes that the complexity of the relevant dispositions\nmakes them difficult to specify, he does think that beliefs and\nattitudes are easily distinguishable in our daily experience. Consider\nan onlooker who witnesses a chess expert open weakly against a novice\nand wonders:\n\n\nDoes he make the move because he believes that it is a strong\none, or because out of charity to his opponent, he doesn\u2019t\nwant to make a strong one? The distinction here between a\nbelief and a want (attitude) is certainly beyond any practical\nobjection. One can imagine the expert, with constant beliefs about the\nopening, using it or not in accordance with his changing desires to\nwin; or one can imagine him, with constant desires to win, using it or\nnot in accordance with his changing beliefs. (1944, 7\u20138)\n\n2.3 Moral Disagreement and Non-Cognitivism about Moral Judgment Are moral problems essentially disagreements or\nuncertainties in belief, attitude, or both? Are moral judgments\nconstituted by beliefs, attitudes, or both? Stevenson suggests that\nmoral problems almost always involve both types of disagreement or\nuncertainty (1944, 11; 1948b, 4). For example, consider an ethical\ndisagreement between a union representative and a company\nrepresentative over an increase in employee wages:\n\n\n\nSuch an argument clearly represents a disagreement in attitude. The\nunion is for higher wages; the company is against\nthem, and neither is content to let the other\u2019s attitude remain\nunchanged. In addition to this disagreement in attitude, of\ncourse, the argument may represent no little disagreement in belief.\nPerhaps the parties disagree about how much the cost of living has\nrisen and how much the workers are suffering under the present wage\nscale. Or perhaps they disagree about the company\u2019s earnings and the\nextent to which the company could raise wages and still operate at a\nprofit. Like any typical ethical argument, then, this argument\ninvolves both disagreement in attitude and disagreement in belief.\n(1948b, 4)\n\n\nHowever, although moral problems almost always involve both types of\ndisagreement or uncertainty, their distinguishing feature is\ndisagreement or uncertainty in attitude.\n\n\nIf the men come to agree in belief about all the factual matters they\nhave considered, and if they continue to have divergent aims in spite\nof this \u2026 they will still have an ethical issue that is\nunresolved. But if they come to agree [in attitude], they will have\nbrought their ethical issue to an end; and this will be so even though\nvarious beliefs \u2026 still remain debatable. Both men may conclude\nthat these remaining beliefs, no matter how they are later settled,\nwill have no decisive effect on their attitudes. (1944, 14\u201315;\nsee also 1948b, 6)\n\n\nStevenson accepts, then, non-cognitivism, a view according to\nwhich moral judgments are essentially constituted at least in part by\nattitudes and moral disagreement is essentially disagreement in\nattitude. Stevenson\u2019s main focus project is on developing, in\nsufficient detail, an attractive non-cognitivist account of moral\nproblems, rather than on arguing for the superiority of\nnon-cognitivism over the competing views (although see 1937; 1944, ch.\n12; 1950a). However, he does support his claim that moral\ndisagreements would essentially involve disagreement in attitude by\nconsidering a number of examples (e.g., 1944, 13\u201318; 1948b,\n3\u20134). In addition to the kinds of cases mentioned above,\nStevenson invites us to consider, for instance, a person who seems to\nbe fully persuaded that what he did was wrong and, for that very\nreason, is more in favor of doing it again:\n\n\nTemporarily puzzled to understand him, we shall be likely to conclude,\n\u2018This is his paradoxical way of abusing what he considers our\noutworn moral conventions. He means to say that it is really all right\nto do it, and that one ought to do it flagrantly in order to discredit\nthe many people who consider it wrong\u2019. But whatever we\nmay make of his meaning (and there are several other interpretations\npossible) we shall scarcely take seriously his protestations of\nagreement. Were we not trying all along to make him disapprove of his\naction? Would not his ethical agreement with us require that he share\nour disfavor\u2014that he agree with us in attitude? (1944,\n16\u201317)\n\n\nHere Stevenson seems to appeal to motivational internalism,\nor to the idea that, roughly, a moral judgment is necessarily\naccompanied with having some motivation to act accordingly (see\nSection 3.2 of the entry on\n moral motivation),\n or with a favorable attitude toward acting in the relevant way.\nIndeed, elsewhere Stevenson notes that \u201c\u2018goodness\u2019\nmust have, so to speak, a magnetism\u201d: a person who\n\u201crecognizes X to be good must ipso facto acquire a\nstronger tendency to act in its favour\u201d (1937, 16).\n\nInterestingly, Stevenson suggests that a point in favor of his\nnon-cognitivist or emotivist view is that it allows us to recognize\n\u201cthe cognitive content of ethics [...] in its full\nvariety\u201d\u2014that \u201can emotive conception of ethics, so\noften criticized for depriving ethics of its thoughtful, reflective\nelements, has actually just the opposite effect\u201d (1950a, 60).\nThe idea is a variation on Moore\u2019s (1903) Open Question Argument: Let\nus suppose that being good may be identified, as a matter of\nconceptual or meaning analysis, with having some descriptive feature,\nD\u2014being promotive of survival, say. If one now wishes\nto determine whether some action would be good, it turns out that one\nonly needs to consider its impact on the instantiation of\nDness. This may be part of what is cognitively relevant. But\nit is at least possible to deem all sorts of descriptive features as\nrelevant to determining what is good. And so most non-emotive accounts\n(Stevenson grants that there are exceptions) will be too restrictive\nregarding what may be deemed to be cognitively relevant to ethics\n(1950a, 60\u201363). One type of non-emotive view that would escape\nthis argument is Moorean non-naturalism, according to which moral\njudgments are beliefs concerning sui generis, non-natural\nproperties. Stevenson applauds such views for recognizing \u201can\nadded factor\u201d to the meaning of moral language that \u201cthe\npurely scientific analyses of ethics are accustomed to ignore,\u201d\nbut takes them to unnecessarily intellectualize the \u201cemotive\nmeaning into an indefinable quality\u201d (1944, 272).\n\nStevenson also appeals, in passing, to an argument from the best\nexplanation about the cause of the disparity of ethical views that\noften occur between people of widely different generations, ethnic or\ngeographic locations. According Stevenson, the disparity is adequately\nexplained if ethical disagreement were essentially disagreement in\nattitude, \u201cfor different temperaments, social needs, and group\npressures would more directly and urgently lead these people to have\nopposed attitudes than it would lead them to have opposed factual\nbeliefs\u201d (1944, 18).\n3. Language and Psychology\n\nFor Stevenson, language is an instrument or tool for serving certain\npurposes; ethical language is thus suited especially for the central\npurposes of ethics. Since the central purposes of ethics are to\nresolve or coordinate attitudes, an analysis of ethical language must\nreveal how ethical language serves these dynamic purposes. It does so,\naccording to Stevenson, by having emotive meaning in\naddition to descriptive meaning, where meaning is to be cashed out in\n\u201cpragmatic\u201d or dispositional terms.\n3.1 Pragmatic Meaning\n\nStevenson intends to provide a theory of emotive and descriptive\nmeaning in the \u201cpragmatic\u201d or \u201cpsychological\u201d\nsense, where this sense of \u2018meaning\u2019 invokes the work of\nCharles Morris. In Foundations of the Theory of Signs (1938),\nMorris had suggested a tripartite division of the study of signs into\n(i) syntax, the study of the relations among signs; (ii) semantics,\nthe study of the relations among signs and their designations or\ndenotations; and (iii) pragmatics, the study of signs as they are used\nby members of a community in order to \u201cmeet more satisfactorily\ntheir individual and common needs\u201d (10), that is, the study of\nsigns as they are used to coordinate mental and social life. Taking\nhis cue from Morris, Stevenson seeks to provide a theory of meaning in\nterms of the \u201cpsychological reactions\u201d of those who use\nthe signs (1944, 42), and, then, to distinguish emotive and\ndescriptive meaning by the different types of psychological reaction\nassociated with the use of emotive and descriptive language\nrespectively.\n\nAccording to Stevenson, explaining emotive and descriptive meaning in\nthis psychological sense of \u2018meaning\u2019 would be promising\nif it did not encounter an immediate problem that \u201chas long been\none of the most troublesome aspects of linguistic theory\u201d (1944,\n42; 1937, 20). The problem, as Stevenson saw it, is that the meaning\nof an expression must be relatively stable across a variety of social\nand linguistic contexts, lest the expression be unhelpful to our\nunderstanding of the many contexts in which the expression is used;\nhowever, the psychological states associated with an expression vary\nwidely across social and linguistic contexts. At a football game, for\nexample, \u2018Hooray!\u2019 may be shouted in connection with\nterrific excitement, but at other times with little emotion at all;\nlikewise, to a postmaster who regularly sorts the mail,\n\u201c\u2018Connecticut\u2019 may cause only a toss of the hand,\nbut for an old resident it may bring a train of reminiscences\u201d\n(1944, 43). Similarly, the sentence \u2018This legislation is\njust\u2019 may be used to express a favorable attitude towards a\nparticular piece of legislation, but not when embedded within the more\ncomplex sentence \u2018Vote for this legislation only if it is\njust\u2019. Thus,\n\n\nSome variation (of psychological states) must of course be allowed,\nelse we shall end with a fictitious entity, serene and thoroughly\nuseless amid the complexities of actual practice; but\n\u2018meaning\u2019 is a term wanted for marking off something\nrelatively constant amid these complexities, not merely for paying\nthem deference. A sense is needed where a sign may \u2018mean\u2019\nless than it \u2018suggests\u2019\u2014a sense in which meanings\nare helpful to the understanding of many contexts, not some\nvagrant sense in which a word has a wholly different\n\u2018meaning\u2019 every time it is used. (1944, 43)\n\n\nStevenson\u2019s task, then, is to provide a psychological theory of\nmeaning according to which the psychological state associated with an\nexpression\u2019s use, and hence an expression\u2019s meaning, remains\nrelatively constant across contexts.\n3.2 Dispositional Theory of Meaning\n\nStevenson\u2019s solution to this problem of flux is to provide a\ndispositional theory of meaning grounded in the causal-historical\nrelations between a sign and the psychological states of those within\na linguistic community who have used and reacted to, and continue to\nuse and react to, the sign. For Stevenson, a sign\u2019s meaning is not\nconstituted by its use on an occasion of utterance. Rather, a sign\u2019s\nmeaning is constituted by its power\u2014its\n\u201ctendency,\u201d \u201cpotentiality,\u201d \u201clatent\nability,\u201d or \u201cdisposition\u201d (1937, 20\u201322; 1944,\n46; 1948a, 158)\u2014to evoke the psychological states of a hearer or\nto express those of a speaker. The power of an expression, like the\npurchasing power of a dollar, or the stimulating power of coffee, is\nto be understood as a complex network of causal relations:\n\n\nThe word \u2018disposition\u2019 \u2026, is useful in dealing with\ncomplicated causal situations, where some specified sort of\nevent is a function of many variables. To illustrate \u2026 Although\ncoffee often \u2018causes\u2019 stimulation, it is never the only\ncause. The degree of stimulation will depend as well on many other\nfactors\u2014the initial state of a man\u2019s fatigue, the absorptive\nstate of his stomach, the constitution of his nervous system, and so\non. (1944, 46)\n\n\nJust as the stimulating power of coffee remains relatively unchanged\ndespite varied reactions or responses to the ingestion of coffee, so\ntoo does the meaning of an expression remain relatively unchanged\ndespite varied psychological states resulting from or leading to the\narticulation of an expression (1944, 46\u201347).\n\nThe stimulating power of coffee, for instance, is a disposition\nconstituted by a complex causal network consisting of: (i)\nstimuli, such as the variable amounts of coffee ingested; and\n(ii) responses, such as the resulting changes in energy,\nattention, anxiety, or irritation. These stimuli and responses are\nmediated by: (iii) attendant circumstances, such as a\ndrinker\u2019s fatigue at the time of ingestion, the absorptive rate of\ntheir stomach, or the constitution of their nervous system; and\n(iv) the basis of the disposition, such as the chemical\ncomposition of the coffee or the soil conditions where it was grown.\nThe responses, then, are a function of the stimuli, attendant\ncircumstances, and basis, and one who specifies these and who\nspecifies in detail their correlation \u201chas said all about the\ndisposition that there is to say\u201d (1944, 51).\n\nThe meaning of a term is the \u201cconjunction\u201d or union of two\ndispositions, one \u201cactive\u201d disposition to evoke\npsychological states of a hearer, another \u201cpassive\u201d\ndisposition to be used to express the psychological states of a\nspeaker, where a disposition is a complex causal network of stimuli\n(e.g., an utterance, in the case of a sign\u2019s active disposition, or a\nmental state, in the case of a passive one), responses (e.g., a\nbelief, in the case of an active disposition, or an utterance, in the\ncase of a passive one), attendant circumstances (e.g., the context of\nutterance), and basis (perhaps the sign\u2019s history of use within a\nlinguistic community) (1944, 57\u201358). Stevenson warns that his\naccount of meaning, understood in causal-dispositional terms, should\nnot be taken as anything close to a complete theory of meaning, but\nonly as \u201chalf analysis, half analogy,\u201d \u201ca device for\npointing to\u201d one that must be extraordinarily complex (1944,\n58).\n3.3 Emotive and Descriptive Meaning\n\nFor Stevenson, the meaning of a sign is, then, a complex dispositional\nproperty. Consequently, since the sentences of a language have\ndistinguishable kinds of dispositions, they have distinguishable kinds\nof meaning.\n\nThe emotive meaning of a sign is a disposition that relates the sign\nto a range of attitudes (1944, 59\u201360). From a hearer or reader\u2019s\npoint of view, feelings or attitudes are the responses, tokens of the\nsign are the stimuli; from a speaker or writer\u2019s point of view,\nattitudes are the stimuli, tokens of the sign are the responses. An\nattitude is itself a disposition whose stimuli and responses relate to\n\u201chindering or assisting\u201d the object of the attitude, that\nwhich one is for or against (1944, 60). As a disposition, the emotive\nmeaning of a sign remains relatively stable, though responses may vary\nacross contexts given different attendant, or contextual,\ncircumstances (1944, 60). Thus, a speaker\u2019s utterance of\n\u201cHooray!\u201d may be occasioned by excitement or, on rare\noccasion, even indifference; but the disposition of the sign to be\nused to express or to evoke these varying attitudes remains relatively\nstable, its stability a result of an \u201celaborate process of\nconditioning\u201d that gives rise to linguistic conventions (1944,\n60\u201362; for discussions of emotive meaning, more generally, and\nof Stevenson\u2019s account, in particular, see, e.g., Stroll 1954, Kerner\n1966, Urmson 1968, and Satris 1987).\n\nThe descriptive meaning of a sign is a disposition that relates the\nsign to a range of \u201ccognitive\u201d states, including belief,\nsupposition, presumption, etc. From a hearer or reader\u2019s point of\nview, cognitive states are the responses, tokens of the sign are the\nstimuli. From a speaker or writer\u2019s point of view, cognitive states\nare the stimuli, tokens of the sign are the responses. Cognitive\nstates, like attitudes, are complex dispositions. (1944,\n62\u201371)\n\nThe emotive and descriptive meanings of signs are related in a variety\nof ways. Signs may have both emotive and descriptive meaning, and\noften do. Perhaps a noncontroversial example is the sentence\n\u2018That was courageous\u2019, whose descriptive meaning relates\ntokens of the sentence to cognitive states that, in some way,\nrepresent the action referred to as one performed in spite of an\nactor\u2019s fear, and whose emotive meaning relates tokens of the sentence\nto favorable states, such as admiration towards the action or actor.\nAccording to Stevenson, almost all words in a natural language have\nboth emotive and descriptive meaning owing to their historical uses in\nemotional contexts (1944, 71). The interplay of emotive and\ndescriptive meaning is complex. For example, the word\n\u2018democracy\u2019 may have come to possess its laudatory emotive\nmeaning in certain contexts because the word refers, via its\ndescriptive meaning, to properties of government that are favored in\nthese contexts. Under suitable circumstances, the word might retain\nits descriptive meaning and acquire a less laudatory emotive meaning,\nor change its descriptive meaning due to its emotive meaning remaining\nconstant (1944, 72).\n4. Ethics, Language, and Methods\n\nEthical language should be suitable for the purposes of ethics. Since,\nfor Stevenson, the purposes of ethics are to settle, coordinate, or\notherwise resolve disagreements in attitude (and ethical uncertainty),\nan analysis of ethical language must display how ethical language is\napt for performing these functions. It is apt, according to Stevenson,\nbecause ethical language (i) almost always has both emotive and\ndescriptive meaning, where (ii) emotive meaning is essential and (iii)\noften strongly independent of descriptive meaning (in the sense in\nwhich \u201cthin\u201d ethical terms, such as \u2018good\u2019,\nmight be said to have emotive meaning that is strongly independent of\nany descriptive meaning it might have). That ethical language has\nessential emotive meaning\u2014that is, has dispositions in which\nattitudes play a most prominent role\u2014implies as it should that\nattitudes and feelings are at issue in cases of moral disagreement or\nuncertainty. That ethical language usually has both emotive and\ndescriptive meanings which often interact in various ways suggests as\nit should that beliefs, and therefore rational methods, can be\nrelevant to resolving moral disagreement or uncertainty. That emotive\nmeaning is often strongly independent of descriptive meaning suggests\nas it should that nonrational \u201cpersuasive\u201d methods can\nalso play a role in settling or resolving moral disagreement or\nuncertainty.\n4.1 Patterns of Analysis\n\nStevenson aims to clarify ethical language by using\n\u201ctools\u201d of analysis. One tool that Stevenson will\nnot use to clarify ethical language is the tool of\ndefinition, at least in the sense of \u2018definition\u2019 that\nimplies \u201cfinding synonym for synonym,\u201d since he thinks\nthat ethical terms, due to their emotive meanings, are indefinable in\nthis sense (1944, 82). Rather, Stevenson\u2019s analytic tool of choice is\na set of models. The models highlight the respective dispositional\nelements (i.e. elements of meaning) of ethical language that, via its\nuse, are to varying degrees in linguistic play (1944, chapters II, IV,\nand IX; see esp. 82\u201383; for discussion, see also Urmson 1968,\nchapters 4 and 6).\n\nTwo such models, labeled \u2018(P1)\u2019 and\n\u2018(P4)\u2019 below, receive a great deal of\nStevenson\u2019s attention, because they paradigmatically exemplify for the\nsentence \u2018This is good\u2019 what Stevenson calls respectively\nhis \u201cFirst Pattern\u201d and \u201cSecond Pattern\u201d of\nanalysis (1944, chapters IV and IX). These patterns and, hence,\n(P1) and (P4) differ most importantly in\ndescriptive richness and emotive force. (P1)\u2019s descriptive\ncontent is scant, conveying only information about the speaker\u2019s\nattitude and, therefore, conveying only somewhat more information than\nis conveyed by (P1)\u2019s relatively strong emotive element;\ntherefore, (P1) well-models those uses of an ethical\nsentence at which front and center is a speaker\u2019s attitude.\n(P4)\u2019s descriptive content conveys more complex, precise\ninformation about the qualities of which the speaker approves and\nmerely characterizes \u2018This is good\u2019 as conveying emotive\nforce; therefore, (P4) well-models those uses of an ethical\nsentence at which front and center are a speaker\u2019s moral\nstandards.\n\nAs models, (P1) and (P4) have different\nstrengths and weaknesses, and while discussing them Stevenson suggests\nor implies several other models: (P2a)-(P3c).\nLike (P1), (P2a)-(P2c) exemplify\nStevenson\u2019s First Pattern of Analysis, and, like (P4),\n(P3a)-(P3c) exemplify Stevenson\u2019s Second Pattern\nof Analysis. Notice that each subset of models, and each model within\neach subset, is listed roughly in order of increasing descriptive\nrichness and decreasing emotive force.\n\nDiscussion begins with (P1), returning later to\n(P0a)\u2013(P0d).\n\n\u2018This is good\u2019 means:\n\n(P0a)\nApprove of this!\n(P0b)\nLet\u2019s all approve of this!\n(P0c)\nHooray for this!\n(P0d)\nHooray for this for being X, Y, and\nZ!\n\n\n(P1)\nI approve of this; do so as well.\n(P2a)\nI approve of this; let\u2019s all do so!\n(P2b)\nI approve of this; hooray for this!\n(P2c)\nI approve of this; how I wish we would all do so!\n\n\n(P3a)\nThis is X; hooray for this!\n(P3b)\nThis is X; hooray for things that are X!\n(P3c)\nThis is X, Y, and Z; hooray for\nthings that are X, Y, and Z!\n\n\n(P4)\nThis is X, Y, and Z [\u201cexcept\nthat \u2018good\u2019 has as well a laudatory emotive meaning which\npermits it to express the speaker\u2019s approval and tends to evoke the\napproval of the hearer\u201d]\n\n\nStevenson devotes a great deal of space in Ethics and\nLanguage discussing the various features and implications of\n(P1). However, despite its usefulness, (P1) is\nnot be taken as some sort of \u201cofficial\u201d model of ethical\nsentences. Five of (P1)\u2019s misleading features, acknowledged\nby Stevenson himself, are as follows:\n\nProblem 1:\nThe imperative is \u201ctoo blunt an instrument\u201d (1944,\n32), evoking attitudes in a overly aggressive, crude way. Moral\nclaims, according to Stevenson, lead rather than command\npeople to alter their attitudes and, so, the force of the judgment\n\u2018This is good\u2019 \u201chas been poorly approximated\u201d\nby (P1) (1944, 32\u201333).\nProblem 2:\nThe imperative suggests that the purpose of moral deliberation and\ndiscussion is to convert others. Since the use of a second-person\nimperative implies a position of authority over one\u2019s audience, this\nmodel gives the impression that the speaker or writer \u201cwishes\nonly to propagate his preconceived aims, without reconsidering\nthem\u201d (1944, 32). However, most moral claims are often\noccasioned not by a desire for \u201cconquest,\u201d but rather by a\ndesire for mutual understanding (1944, 32).\nProblem 3:\nThe declarative suggests that the descriptive element is often\nquite narrow and perhaps quite precise, when in point of fact it is\noften quite broad or complex and quite vague (1944, 33\u201334 and\n206\u2013213).\nProblem 4:\nThe declarative fails to model the possibility of disagreement in\nbelief, which intuitively is a part of many moral disagreements.\nSuppose, for example, that Smith declares that complimenting others is\ngood, while Jones declares that complimenting others is bad, and that\ntheir disagreement is grounded in the conflict between Smith\u2019s belief\nthat complimenting others generally leads to a healthy degree of\nself-esteem and Jones\u2019s belief that complimenting others too often\nleads to excessive pride. According to (P1), the\ndescriptive element of Smith\u2019s utterance is rendered \u2018I approve\nof complimenting others\u2019, while Jones\u2019s utterance is rendered\n\u2018I disapprove of complimenting others\u2019 (1944, 22). But\nhere, Smith and Jones disagree in belief not at all.\nProblem 5:\nThe declarative implies, implausibly, that the full justification\nof a moral claim always requires the provision of reasons for\nbelieving that a speaker approves or disapproves of that to\nwhich she refers (1963b, 210\u2013212).\n\n\nModels (P2a)\u2013(P2c) rectify Problems 1 and\n2 to some degree. They lessen the blunt force and authoritativeness of\nthe second-person imperative by using a more interpersonally agreeable\nfirst-person plural imperative, exclamative, and optative\nrespectively. (P2a), because it retains an imperative,\nmodels better than (P2b) and (P2c) the\ndispositions of moral sentences to evoke an audience\u2019s attitudes or\nbehaviors. The latter two, containing instead an exclamative and\noptative respectively, model better than (P2a) the\ndispositions of moral sentences to express a speaker\u2019s attitudes.\n\nModels (P3a)\u2013(P3c) rectify Problems 3-5 to\nsome degree. Each suggests that the descriptive element in ethical\nsentences is more complex and perhaps more vague, suggesting as they\ndo a more general description of an action, person, policy, etc. as\nexemplifying certain characteristics or properties, rather than the\nnarrower and more precise description of a speaker as exemplifying a\nspecific attitude. Thus, each allows that moral disagreement may be\ngrounded in disagreement in belief\u2014e.g., Smith and Jones can use\n\u2018complimenting others is good\u2019 and \u2018complimenting\nothers is not good\u2019 respectively as a means of disagreeing in\nbelief about whether complimenting others exemplifies property X (or Y\nor Z)\u2014and, thereby, eliminates the implication that fully\njustifying a moral claim requires providing reasons for\nbelieving that a speaker has the particular attitude she is\ndescribed as having.\n\nStevenson\u2019s (P4), has a descriptive element that is more\nprecise than (P3a)\u2013(P3b). It also removes\neven a model of the emotive element, leaving instead just a\ncharacterization to the effect that some emotive element is present.\nThus, unlike (P0a)\u2013(P1), which place the\ndispositional relations between ethical terms and\nattitudes\u2014i.e., emotive meaning\u2014front and center,\n(P4) instead places front and center the dispositional\nrelations between ethical terms and beliefs\u2014i.e., descriptive\nmeaning. (P4) thus captures the passive dispositions of\nethical terms to be used as a result of a speaker or writer\u2019s more\nspecific cognitive states about the properties or characteristics of\nan action, person, etc., and the terms\u2019 active dispositions to\ncause such cognitive states in an audience. Perhaps the more\ndescriptive \u201cthick\u201d ethical terms, such as\n\u2018cruel\u2019, \u2018kind\u2019, or \u2018courageous\u2019\nprovide the best examples of terms that possess such dispositions.\n\nReturning to (P0a)\u2013(P0d), these rectify to\nsome degree an additional problem, one that encumbers all of\n(P1)\u2013(P4).\n\nProblem 6:\nIt is often simply too difficult to determine whether the\ndescriptive meaning of ethical language is strictly\ndesignated or merely suggested (1944, 85\u201387).\n\n\nThe distinction between \u2018strictly designates\u2019 and\n\u2018suggests\u2019 is most plausibly understood as invoking the\ndistinction between semantics and pragmatics, or the distinction\nbetween that which is conveyed as a matter of convention or as a\nmatter of conversational dynamics:\n\n\nThe distinction which the question presupposes, that between what\n\u2018good\u2019 means and what it suggests, is\noften beyond the precision of ordinary language. It is a distinction\nbetween descriptive dispositions of the term, one of which is\npreserved by linguistic rules and the other is not. In the rigorous\ndiscourse of science or mathematics, which avails itself of\ninterrelated sets of definitions or formal postulates, the distinction\nis readily made. In the rough contexts of daily life, however, a great\nmany rules are not stipulated, being imperfectly evident from people\u2019s\nlinguistic habits; and even those rules which are occasionally\nstipulated are not constantly followed. Certain rules, of course,\nare always observed; for \u2018good\u2019, whatever else,\nis \u2018not bad\u2019 and \u2018not indifferent\u2019. But many\nother rules remain as mere possibilities. If such a rule is\nspecifically called to a person\u2019s attention he may accept\nit\u2014though usually only temporarily, for a given purpose. Not\nuntil a great many rules are permanently settled, though, do we get\nbeyond the undecided region that separates descriptive meaning from\nsuggestiveness. When rules are in the course of becoming\ngenerally accepted, there is a long period over which we may either\naccept or reject them without violence to conventional language. Our\ndecision may settle the matter for our own usage, and determine what\nis afterward to be called the term\u2019s descriptive meaning, and\nwhat is to be called its suggestiveness; but our finished product is\nby no means the same as the raw material. (1944, 86; see also 1948a,\n154\u2013158; 1963b, 208\u2013210)\n\n\nThus, Stevenson\u2019s distinction between \u2018strictly\ndesignates\u2019 and \u2018suggests\u2019 is plausibly captured by\nthe later Gricean distinction between that which is \u201csaid\u201d\nor \u201cconventionally implicated\u201d on the one hand, and that\nwhich is \u201cconversationally implicated\u201d on the other (Grice\n1975). Models (P0a)\u2013(P0d), then, are\nuseful for reminding us that the \u201cstrict\u201d meaning of\nethical terms may include only its emotive meaning; if so,\nhowever, its descriptive meaning is strongly suggested and, thus,\nalways remains in linguistic play (1944, 95\u201396).\n4.2 Reason and Reasons\n\nAn ethical problem is essentially constituted by disagreement or\nuncertainty in attitude, though it is often constituted by\ndisagreement or uncertainty in belief as well. Resolving an ethical\nproblem, therefore, requires coordinating attitudes, sometimes by\ncoordinating beliefs that causally affect those attitudes. Attitudes\nmay be coordinated by methods that do not involve the use of language;\nphysical force, bribery, and physical seduction are just a few\nnonlinguistic means of shaping and coordinating attitudes. Stevenson,\nhowever, is interested only in linguistic methods of\ncoordinating attitudes, which he categorizes as either\n\u201crational\u201d or \u201cnonrational.\u201d Rational methods\nseek to shape or coordinate attitudes by using language to produce\nreasons; Stevenson thus calls the set of such methods, aptly enough,\n\u201cReason.\u201d Nonrational methods seek to shape or coordinate\nattitudes by using language in other ways; Stevenson calls this set of\nmethods \u201cPersuasion.\u201d\n\nA reason, for Stevenson, is \u201cany statement about\nany matter of fact which any speaker considers\nlikely to alter attitudes\u201d (1944, 115). \u201cWhether this\nreason will in fact support or oppose the judgment will depend,\u201d\nStevenson says, \u201con whether the hearer believes it, and upon\nwhether if he does, it will actually make a difference to his\nattitudes; but it may conveniently be called a reason (though not\nnecessarily a \u2018valid\u2019 one) regardless of whether it is\naccepted or not\u201d (1944, 115). Thus, a reason is a statement\nwhose content, if believed, is causally relevant to altering\nattitudes. (This may seem like a very surprising account of what it is\nto be a reason for some attitude; see also\n Section 5.1,\n below.)\n\nStevenson provides a plethora of examples throughout his work to\nclarify the variety of ways in which beliefs, in their intermediary\nroles, may serve to strengthen or weaken attitudes (1944, especially\nChapters V, VI, VIII). For example, suppose that Smith disapproves of\npolicies that put a great burden on the poor and make little\ndifference to the rich. They say of a proposed policy that it is good.\nAssuming model (P1), Smith\u2019s claim is akin to the claim\n\u201cI approve of this policy; do so as well.\u201d Assuming model\n(P3a), their claim is akin to the claim \u201cThis policy\ndoes not put great burden on the poor while making little difference\nto the rich; hooray for this policy.\u201d Jones might then, in\nappealing to the claim that the policy puts great burden on the poor\nand makes little difference to the rich, alter Smith\u2019s attitude toward\nthe policy either by directly contradicting a belief of Smith\u2019s\n(assuming model (P3a)) or by leading Smith to accept that\nthey do not approve of the policy, which again contradicts their\nbelief (assuming model (P1)). Here the impact of Smith\u2019s\nnewly acquired belief on their earlier moral judgments is due to the\nlogical relation between the beliefs. Next consider a case\nwhere Smith hasn\u2019t really thought about the policy before. They might\nnevertheless be disposed, upon coming to believe that the policy puts\na great burden on the poor while making little difference to the rich,\nto disapprove of the policy. Here the newly acquired belief would not\ncontradict an earlier belief of Smith\u2019s, but it might nevertheless\nhave an impact, thanks to a suitable psychological relation,\non their beliefs and attitudes. Other sorts of examples, discussed by\nStevenson, of reasons for attitude revision without a logical relation\nto existing beliefs include appeals to authority, or to the genealogy\nof beliefs or attitudes (1944, 123\u2013125).\n\nThus, ethical inquiry and deliberation often proceeds rationally by\npresenting reasons to be for or against something,\nreasons whose effectiveness is tied to their logical or psychological\nrelation to others\u2019 beliefs (for criticism and further discussion of\nStevenson\u2019s account reasons, see, again, also\n Section 5.1).\n4.3 Persuasion and Persuasive Definitions\n\nNot all linguistic attempts to coordinate or settle attitudes appeal\nto reasons. For example, we often merely invoke or stress the purely\nemotive element of words, or use metaphor, intonation, pleasantness of\nspeech or rhythm, and the like. These are all nonrational, but still\nlinguistic, methods of settling and coordinating attitudes that\nStevenson calls \u201cPersuasion.\u201d Consider, first, the many\nuses of thick ethical terms, such as \u2018courageous\u2019 or\n\u2018democratic\u2019. Often, we try to coordinate attitudes by\ninvoking these words more for their emotive meanings than for their\ndescriptive, especially when the descriptive meanings are taken for\ngranted. Saying that one acted in the face of fear may be\ndescriptively accurate; saying that one acted courageously, especially\nwhen all relevant parties already believe that one acted in the face\nof fear, is more likely an attempt to coordinate admiration among the\nparties. Consider also the persuasive strategy of repetition. Smith\nsays that Jones did the right thing; asked for a reason, Smith merely\nstates that Jones\u2019s act was an instance of performing his duty. Here,\nSmith provides no reason at all, but merely attempts to coordinate\npositive attitudes by relying on the repeated effect of the emotive\nforce of evaluative terms. For a different use of repetition, consider\nthe persuasiveness of Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s repetition of \u2018I\nhave a dream\u2019 and \u2018Let freedom ring\u2019 during his\n\u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, delivered during the 1963 March\non Washington. These are just a few examples of moral persuasion.\n\nPersuasive techniques, according to Stevenson, play a vital role in\nattempts to modify the standards of a society or group. At the center\nof such reform is the use of what Stevenson calls \u201cpersuasive\ndefinition,\u201d or attempts to give \u201ca new conceptual meaning\nto a familiar word without substantially changing its emotive meaning,\nand which is used with the conscious or unconscious purpose of\nchanging, by this means, the direction of people\u2019s interests\u201d\n(1938b, 32; 1944, chapter IX). Suppose Smith recognizes that Jones has\nhad little formal education and uses grammatically incorrect sentences\nand obvious literary references and, on this basis, claims that Jones\nis simply not a person of \u201cculture.\u201d Rodriguez agrees that\nJones has such qualities but claims that Jones is a person of culture\nnotwithstanding, for \u201cin the true and full sense of the term,\n\u2018culture\u2019 means imaginative sensitivity and\noriginality,\u201d and these qualities Jones has in\nabundance:\n\n\nIt will be obvious that [Rodriguez], in defining\n\u2018culture\u2019, was not simply introducing a convenient\nabbreviation, nor was he seeking to clarify \u2018the\u2019 common\nmeaning of the term. His purpose was to redirect [Smith\u2019s] attitudes,\nfeeling that [Smith] was insufficiently appreciative of their friend\u2019s\nmerits. \u2018Culture\u2019 had and would continue to have, for\npeople of their sort, a laudatory emotive meaning. The definition\nurged [Smith] to stop using the laudatory term to refer to grammatical\nniceties, literary allusions, and the rest, and to use it, instead, to\nrefer to imaginative sensitivity and originality. In this manner, it\nsought to place the former qualities in a relatively poor light, and\nthe latter in a fine one, and thus to redirect [Smith\u2019s] admiration.\nWhen people learn to call something by a name rich in emotive meaning,\nthey more readily admire it; and when they learn not to call it by\nsuch a name, they less readily admire it. The definition made use of\nthis fact. It sought to change attitudes by changing names. (1944,\n211\u2013212; see also 1938b)\n\n\nPersuasive definitions lie at the heart of much moral reform, whether\nfor good or ill (1944, 209\u2013210). \u201cThe words are\nprizes,\u201d Stevenson writes, \u201cwhich each man seeks to bestow\non the qualities of his own choice\u201d (1938b, 35).\n5. Objections to Stevenson\u2019s Emotivism\n\nA number of objections have been leveled against Stevenson\u2019s emotivism\nover the years. They fall within two categories, one related to\nStevenson\u2019s account of moral thought and metaphysics, the other to his\naccount of moral language.\n5.1 Objections to Stevenson\u2019s Account of Moral Thought\n\nStevenson holds a non-cognitivist view, according to which moral\njudgments or thoughts are essentially constituted at least in part by\ndesire-like attitudes, feelings, or interests, those mental states\nwhose general character is to be for or against\nsomething. Several objections to Stevenson\u2019s theory have been due to\nperceived implications of non-cognitivism.\n\nObjection from Moral Properties. According to this objection,\nif non-cognitivism is true, then something is bad (good, evil, etc.)\nonly if a person has an unfavorable attitude towards it; however,\nhaving such an attitude (the objection goes) cannot be a necessary\ncondition for an event\u2019s being bad (good, evil, etc.). Consider, for\nexample, Blanshard\u2019s (1949) example in which a rabbit has been caught\nin a severe hunting trap for several days, causing the rabbit\nunnecessary, prolonged, and extreme agony. According to Blanshard\u2019s\nunderstanding of non-cognitivism, until a person has an unfavorable\nattitude towards such an event or state of affairs, the rabbit\u2019s being\nin such agony would not be bad. Since (the objection continues) this\nconclusion is absurd, Stevenson\u2019s account of moral thought must be\nfalse. However, this objection conflates Stevenson\u2019s theory of moral\nthought with a theory of moral properties, assuming as it does that\nhaving, for example, an unfavorable attitude towards an event\nconstitutes the badness of that event, at least in part. But\nthis is the kind of moral metaphysics that Stevenson\u2019s theory is\ndesigned to avoid. According to Stevenson, either there is nothing\nthat constitutes badness (or goodness, etc.), because there are no\nsuch moral properties, or, perhaps better: questions concerning what\nconstitutes the badness of an event are ethical questions of\nwhat to disapprove of\u2014questions to which non-cognitivism as a\nmetaethical theory offers no answers. Non-cognitivism is\nsilent on what it is in virtue of which things have the moral\nproperties that they have (if they have any). It just tells us what it\nis to think that something is bad.\n\nObjection from Unemotional Moral Judgments. Blanshard also\ninvites us to consider a person who thinks, with great contempt, that\nunnecessary, prolonged, extreme agony is bad and claims repeatedly\nthat it is bad, still repeating the claim even a week later though\nfatigue has dissipated all contempt:\n\n\nWhen we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing, the\nfeeling with which we made it last week may be at or near the\nvanishing point, but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we\ndid before, we should certainly answer Yes. We should say that we made\nour point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the\nsecond time, but that it was the same point we were making. And if we\nsee that what we meant to say remains the same, while the feeling\nvaries from intensity to near zero, it is not the feeling that we\nprimarily meant to express. (1949, 45)\n\n\nThe possibility of continuing to think that a certain event is bad,\neven though the attitude or feeling with which one originally judged\nthe event as bad has partially or even completely dissipated over time\nmay seem incompatible with non-cognitivism. However, it is not clear\nthat this is correct. Stevenson\u2019s account of the meaning of evaluative\njudgments, given in complex dispositional terms (see\n Section 3.2),\n allows for considerable variability in terms of the kinds of feelings\nthat may or may not attend a moral judgment. (Similar considerations\nwould apply to the question regarding whether it is possible to hold a\nmoral judgment without being suitably motivated. For\ndiscussion, see, e.g., Svavarsd\u00f3ttir 1999.)\n\nObjection from Moral Chaos. Stevenson grants that moral\ndisagreement may sometimes be rationally irresolvable. Some might\nworry that if this is so, then moral chaos is likely to ensue. Taking\nthis objection to heart, Blanshard goes as far as to claim that\n\u201c[The general acceptance of strong emotivism] would, so far as\none can see, be an international disaster\u201d (1949). Stevenson\ncould simply respond that even if true, this would not imply that his\naccount of moral thought is false. However, he also suggests that such\nan objection arises from fear that cannot be assuaged by postulating\nsome objective truth or robust moral properties awaiting to be\ndiscovered (e.g., 1944, 336 and 1950a, 68\u201370). Rather, such fear\ncan be assuaged only when we have a clear, realistic understanding of\nthe nature and complexity of moral disagreement and of the methods by\nwhich they can be, and often are, resolved:\n\n\nThe present analysis can afford no assurance that dictators and\nself-seeking politicians, whose skill in exhortation is so manifest,\n\u201cinevitably must\u201d fail, if left unopposed, in reshaping\nmoral codes to serve their narrow interests. \u2026 But this much\nmust be said: Those who cherish altruism, and look forward to a time\nwhen a stable society will be governed by farsighted men, will serve\nthese ideals poorly by turning from present troubles to fancied\nrealms. For these ideals, like all other attitudes, are not imposed\nupon human nature by esoteric forces; they are a part of human nature\nitself. If they are to become a more integral part of it, they must be\nfought for. They must be fought for with the words \u2018right\u2019\nand \u2018wrong\u2019, else these attitude-molding weapons will be\nleft to the use of opponents. And they must be supported with\nclear-minded reasons, else hypostatic obscurantism will bring\ncontempt to the cause it is intended to plead. (1944, 110; see also\n1961\u201362b)\n\n\nObjection from Normativity. Stevenson writes that whether a\nstatement, adduced as a reason in support of an ethical judgment,\n\u201cwill in fact support or oppose the judgment will depend on\nwhether the hearer believes it, and upon whether if he does, it will\nactually make a difference to his attitudes,\u201d and that such\nstatement or consideration \u201cmay conveniently be called a reason\n(though not necessarily a \u2018valid\u2019 one) regardless of\nwhether it is accepted or not\u201d (1944, 115). It may easily seem,\nthen, as if Stevenson would wish to explain what it is for some\nconsideration, R, to count in favor of some action,\nfor instance, in terms of the causal efficacy of citing R in\nproducing the action in question, or in altering attitudes. It may\nseem as if he would wish to explain normativity, or\nnormative authority, directly in terms of psychological impact. This\nmay seem implausible, regardless of the details of the psychological\nstory.\n\nObjection from Irrelevant Reasons. Moreover, Stevenson\u2019s\naccount of reasons seems to deliver wrong results, as what is\npsychologically effective is not always normatively relevant. A\ncolleague of Stevenson\u2019s, Richard Brandt, put the worry as\nfollows:\n\n\nOn the emotive theory, \u2026 if one is moved to disapprove\nsocialized medicine by the thought that any expression of approval\nwould oust him from his favorite club, he has been moved, according to\nthe emotive theory, by as ethically relevant a consideration as any\nother he might have thought of. Now, I do not think this describes\nordinary ethical thinking; we think some persuasive beliefs are\ndistinctly irrelevant. (Brandt 1950a, 313)\n\n\nThe last two objections are based on a misunderstanding. We may give\nthe response in Stevenson\u2019s own words:\n\n\n\u2026 to say that a reason is \u201crelevant\u201d to a judgment\nis sometimes to say that the reason \u2026 ought to make a\ndifference to it. In this sense most people will agree that a\nman\u2019s being ousted from his club is \u201cirrelevant\u201d to his\njudgment about socialized medicine; for they will feel his judgment\nought not be influenced by such consideration. Whenever we\nsay what a man\u2019s reasons ought to be, we are making a judgment of our\nown about the way he reaches his judgment. That is\nan important thing to do, but it is not a part of the specialized task\nthat I have set for myself. I have tried not to judge but only to\nunderstand what goes on in ethics\u2014my metanormative inquiry being\nitself nonnormative. (1950c, 528)\n\n\nSo, Stevenson escapes the Objection from Normativity because he is\nnot offering an account of normative authority, or of\nreasonhood, in terms of efficacy in modifying attitudes. And he escapes\nthe Objection from Irrelevant Reasons because nothing in his theory\nsuggests that what is ethically relevant, or what is a (good) reason\nfor what, would be determined by such considerations of efficacy.\nThere remains, of course, an interesting challenge regarding how,\nexactly, we should understand judgments about normative reasons, or\nabout ethical relevance\u2014an issue which Stevenson does not\naddress in any detail (for Brandt\u2019s concerns regarding what remarks\nStevenson offers, see Brandt 1950b; for a more recent discussion of\nthis challenge in the context of contemporary expressivist views, see\nSinclair 2016).\n\nObjection from Fallibility. An interesting challenge is\narticulated by Stevenson himself, regarding our judgments of ethical\nfallibility. The question here is whether Stevenson\u2019s emotive theory\nallows us to \u201cprovide a proper place\u201d for \u201cour\nwillingness to acknowledge that our judgments must often be held open\nto correction, as distinct from being proclaimed in a manner implying\nthat we have said the last word\u201d (1968, 203). We need (1) an\naccount of expressions of ethical fallibility, and (2) an explanation\nfor why it makes sense to acknowledge our fallibility, given the\nemotivist account of the phenomenon. So, first, what does an\nexpression of ethical fallibility amount to, on the emotivist view?\nStevenson suggests that just as we may acknowledge fallibility in\nbelief by saying \u201cMany things that I believe to be the case may\nnot be the case,\u201d we may also acknowledge fallibility in attitude\nby saying \u201cMany things that meet with my approval may not be\nright\u201d (1968, 206). The function of this sort of acknowledgement\nis to indicate that the speaker is \u201cprepared, on further\nreflection,\u201d to change their mind, which creates \u201chope for\ntwo-way discussion\u201d and allays fears to the effect that the\naudience would be expected to listen to the speaker as their\n\u201cdisciples\u201d (1968, 207\u2013210). This preparedness to\nrevise one\u2019s attitudes is a matter of expecting that there are reasons\nfor approving or disapproving that one has yet to consider (1968,\n214\u2013215). On Stevenson\u2019s account of such reasons, it would then\nbe a matter of thinking that there may be considerations such that\nought to influence one to revise one\u2019s attitudes. Stevenson\u2019s brief\nremarks on the topic do not provide us with a detailed account of\nfallibility judgments, but it is suggestive of a later and much\ndiscussed proposal by Blackburn (1998, 318; for discussion, see Egan\n2007 and, e.g., the literature cited in Bex-Priestley 2018).\n\nGiven the emotivist account of moral thought and discourse, does it\nmake sense to acknowledge our fallibility? Stevenson puts the\nworry as follows:\n\n\nWe acknowledge our fallibility in science, it may be urged, because we\nare convinced that the universe, as studied by science, is in some\nsense \u201cout there\u201d to be described. \u2026 When we\nexpress beliefs about these facts, then, we are very far from being\nnon-objective painters, who are free to make such designs as they\nwill. Instead, we are realistic painters, intent on being faithful to\nwhat we are representing. Now it is our attempt to be faithful to the\nfacts of the universe, it may be urged, that leads us to acknowledge\nour scientific fallibility. The facts may belie our beliefs,\njust as the objects that a realistic painter is painting may belie his\npicture. \u2026 But in ethics, the objection continues, so\nlong as that discipline is conceived as involving an expression of\nattitudes, we have no such situation. We of necessity become\nnon-objective painters rather than realistic painters, for we find\nnothing \u201cout there\u201d for our attitudes to represent.\n\u2026 And why, it may be asked, so long as we accept this\nconception of ethics, should we have any incentive to acknowledge\nour fallibility? (1968, 211\u2013212)\n\n\nStevenson replies that this worry is mistaken both in what it expects\nfor ethics and in what it expects for science. In the case of beliefs,\ntoo, we don\u2019t first look directly at the facts and then to our beliefs\n(as we might compare our model with a portrait that we have painted),\nbut rather \u201caccumulate as many reasons as [we] can that bear on\nthe question\u201d (1968, 213). In both science and in ethics, what\nwe worry about, in acknowledging our fallibility, is the possibility\nof there being reasons for beliefs or attitudes that we haven\u2019t taken\ninto consideration in forming our views. And in both cases, our\nacknowledgments of fallibility serve the important functions of\nencouraging further discussion and inquiry. Given the account of\nfallibility judgments provided by the emotive theory, there is no\nreason to think that our expressions of fallibility in ethics would\nhave to be in any way half-hearted or capricious, and so our\nacknowledgments of fallibility in attitude make perfectly good sense\n(1968, 212\u2013215). Or this is, in any case, Stevenson\u2019s reply to\nthe worry about fallibility, as he construes it.\n5.2 Objections to Stevenson\u2019s Account of Moral Language\n\nObjections also arise in connection of Stevenson\u2019s account of the\nmeaning of moral language.\n\nObjections from Illocutionary/Perlocutionary Conflation.\nStevenson claims repeatedly that moral language is used to express a\nspeaker\u2019s attitudes or to evoke or otherwise shape the attitudes of\nothers. One might worry that this involves conflation of illocutionary\nacts and perlocutionary intentions (e.g., Hare 1952 Section 1.7 and\n1997 Sections 1\u20135\u20131.6; Urmson 1968). Illocutionary acts\nare the acts that a speaker performs in uttering a sentence: warning,\nadvising, describing, commanding, and so on. Like sentences,\nillocutionary acts are subject to logical constraints\u2014it would\nbe logically inconsistent, in some intuitive sense, to direct one\u2019s\nhearer to both close and open a particular window (\u2018Close that\nwindow and open that same window\u2019), for example. Since sentences\nand the illocutionary acts they are typically used to perform have\nsimilar logical constraints, illocutionary acts may plausibly be\nassociated in some appropriate way with the meanings of sentences. Now\nwhen a speaker performs an illocutionary act in uttering a sentence,\nshe often does so with particular intentions or effects in mind. For\nexample, knowing that her audience often attempts to annoy her by\ndoing the opposite of what she asks, a speaker may utter \u2018Keep\nthe window closed\u2019 with the intention that her audience will in\nfact open the window. Thus, there need be no logical\ninconsistency between directing one to keep a particular window closed\nand an intention that the window be opened. Thus, it is concluded,\nperlocutionary intention ought not be associated with the semantics or\nmeanings of sentences. The Objection from Illocutionary/Perlocutionary\nConflation, then, is that Stevenson\u2019s theory of meaning incorporates\nthat which is irrelevant to semantics, namely perlocutionary\nintentions. This objection is related to the next.\n\nThe Objection from Instrumentalism. Stevenson\u2019s theory may\nseem to be an \u201cinstrumentalist\u201d theory that explains the\nmeaning of moral sentences by appealing to the illocutionary acts they\nare typically used to perform, that is, to their typical illocutionary\nforces. However, a great many uses of moral sentences fail to have\nsuch force. For example, when moral sentence 1 is used in utterances\nof sentences 2 or 3, it is used without its usual expressive\nforce.\n\nInsulting others is wrong.\nIf insulting others is wrong, I\u2019ll stop.\nIt is possible that insulting others is wrong.\n\n\nThus, the objection goes, Stevenson\u2019s theory of meaning leaves too\nmuch unsaid about a great many uses of ethical language, and\nconsequently, is radically incomplete.\n\nThese last two objections are understandable, given how often\nStevenson appeals to the uses and purposes of moral language.\nNevertheless, they miss their mark, for Stevenson\u2019s theory of meaning\nis not an \u201cinstrumentalist\u201d theory of meaning, but rather\na dispositional theory\n (Section 3.2;\n Urmson 1968, Ch. 4; Warnock 1978, Ch. 3). Stevenson associates the\nmeaning of a word or sentence with neither perlocutionary intentions\nnor with illocutionary force, but rather with the conjunction or union\nof its passive and active dispositions.\n\nThe Frege-Geach Objection. Because Stevenson\u2019s theory is\noften thought to succumb to the Objection from Instrumentalism, it is\nalso thought to succumb to the Frege-Geach Objection, perhaps the most\npressing objection to any emotivist or expressivist theory of meaning.\nThis objection is so-called because Peter Geach (1958, 1960, 1965),\nrelying on insights from Frege (e.g., 1918), argued persuasively that\na sentence\u2019s illocutionary force cannot constitute its meaning. The\nstrength of the Frege-Geach Objection arises from the fact that\nnatural languages are compositional and, thus, that a minimal\ncondition of adequacy on any semantic theory is that it specify that\nwhich sentences contribute to the more complex sentences into which\nthey are embeddable. For example, a minimally adequate semantic theory\nfor English will entail that the meaning of sentence 1. remains the\nsame when it is embedded within sentences 2. or 3., since an\nunderstanding of the latter sentences rests on an understanding of\ntheir respective parts, including 1., and of the significance of the\nway those parts are combined. However, since (it is thought)\nStevenson\u2019s theory of meaning holds that moral sentences are used to\nexpress a speaker\u2019s attitudes\u2014i.e., used with expressive\nillocutionary force\u2014and since moral sentences are often used as\nparts of more complex sentences without such expressive force, as in\nsentences 2. and 3., Stevenson has failed to provide a minimally\nadequate theory of meaning for moral sentences.\n\nThe Frege-Geach objection may ultimately undermine Stevenson\u2019s theory\nof moral language, though not, as because his theory identifies a\nsentence\u2019s meaning with the illocutionary force of its utterance.\nAssociating a sentence\u2019s meaning instead with the set of its passive\nand active dispositions, Stevenson\u2019s theory of meaning implies that\nsentences will have relatively stable meanings across contexts of use\n (Sections 3.1\n and\n 3.2),\n and therefore, that these dispositions might themselves be\ncontributed to the more complex sentences into which they embed.\nPrecisely how Stevenson\u2019s dispositional theory could be extended to\naccount for compositionality in this way is unclear, and Stevenson\nhimself appears never to have been sufficiently worried by the\nFrege-Geach objection to respond to it. One idea would be that\nsentential operators, such as \u2018if \u2026 then\u2019 and\n\u2018it is possible that\u2019 be treated as functions from the\ndispositions of the component sentences to a resulting set of\ndispositions, where the latter would constitute the meaning of the\ncomplex sentence. Stevenson hints at such a possible extension of his\ntheory while discussing the compositionality of atomic sentences:\n\n\nNo attempt has been made here to deal with one of the most difficult\nproblems that meaning-theory includes\u2014that of explaining how\nseparate words, each one with its own meaning, can combine to yield\nsentence-meanings. It is feasible, perhaps, to take each word as\nhaving a disposition to affect cognition, just as the full sentence\ndoes. The problem reduces, then, to one of explaining the interplay of\nthe dispositions of the several words, when realized conjointly. The\nanalogy of the magnets will still serve, used now to illustrate the\nrelationship of meanings rather than of beliefs. We\nmay compare the meaning of each word with the disposition of some one\nof the magnets, and compare the meaning of the sentence with the\ndisposition that may be assigned to the group of magnets. Each word\nhas an independent meaning in the sense that if it is replaced by\ncertain others in any context, there will be a typical sort of\ndifference in the meaning of the context; but the precise way in which\nthe word\u2019s meaning is realized will depend on the meaning of the other\nwords that accompany it. (1944, 67)\n\n\nSince Stevenson suggests that he might explain the compositionality of\natomic sentences in terms of functions from the dispositions of a\nsentence\u2019s parts to a set of resulting dispositions, it is plausible\nthat he might also wish to extend his theory in a similar way to\nexplain the compositionality of complex sentences. Whether such a\ntheory could sustain additional scrutiny is debatable. For more\nin-depth but accessible discussion of emotivist and expressivist\nattempts to respond to the Frege-Geach Objection, see especially\nSchroeder 2008 and 2010 and the entry on\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism.\n6. Stevenson\u2019s Legacy\n\nStevenson remains a central figure in current day metaethics, a result\nof his development of at least four key ideas:\n\nProgress in ethical theory begins by focusing in the first\ninstance on moral thought\u2014on what it is to think that\nsomething is good, bad, evil, etc.\nMoral thoughts are essentially constituted at least in part by\nattitudes or interests, that is, those feelings, attitudes, or other\naffective states that are most closely related to motivation and\naction, which can be generally characterized as states of being\nfor or being against.\nAttitudes or interests can be, and often are, rationally\ngovernable.\nMoral sentences have both emotive and descriptive meaning.\n\n\nThese four ideas remain central to current day expressivists, such as\nBlackburn (1984, 1993) and Gibbard (1990, 2003), whose work arises\nespecially from ideas 1\u20133. Indeed, the title of Gibbard 1990,\nWise Choices, Apt Feelings, suggests all three ideas.
