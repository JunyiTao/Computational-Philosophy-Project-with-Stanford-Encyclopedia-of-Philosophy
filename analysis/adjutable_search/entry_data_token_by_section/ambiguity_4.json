    "main_text": "What (Linguistic) Ambiguity Isn\u2019t || Under-specification and Generality\n2.3 Under-specification and Generality\n\nI have a sister in New York, a sister in Kingston and one in Toronto.\nIf I tell you that I am going to visit one of my sisters, what I say\nunderspecifies which sister I am going to see. This can be frustrating\nif you are trying to figure out where I am going. But this\nisn\u2019t due to \u2018one of my sisters\u2019 being ambiguous\nambiguous. Its meaning is clear. The sentence is\n\u2018sense-general\u2019; it doesn\u2019t specify some detail without\nthereby being ambiguous with respect to that detail. In general,\nunder- determination and generality may leave open many possibilities\nwithout being ambiguous between those possibilities. One more\nterminological note: in the cognitive linguistics literature (e.g.\nDunbar 2001) it is common to treat what we call \u2018sense\ngenerality\u2019 as vagueness: a single lexeme with a unified meaning\nthat is unspecified with respect to certain features.\n\nSimilarly, if I tell you that I am going to visit my aunt, I\nunderspecify whether it is my mother\u2019s sister or my\nfather\u2019s sister whom I am going to go visit. Nothing follows\nabout the univocality or ambiguity of \u2018aunt\u2019. It simply\nmeans \u2018aunt\u2019 is true of things that are female siblings of\nyour parent. By the same token, \u2018human\u2019 doesn\u2019t make\nany demand on an person\u2019s mass in order to be part of its\nextension.\n\nIt is easy to mistake sense generality for ambiguity, as often the\nextension of a univocal term can break up into two or more distinct\nsalient categories. The sentence \u2018I ordered filet mignon\u2019\ndoesn\u2019t specify whether or not the filet was to be given to me\ncooked or raw.\nYou will surely be annoyed and say \u2018that\u2019s not what I\nmeant\u2019 at a restaurant if the waiter brings the filet raw, but\nnot so at the butcher shop. Often it is difficult to tell when the\ndistinction in extension corresponds to an ambiguity in the meaning of\nthe term. But difficulty in telling these apart in some cases should\nnot lead us to abjure the distinction.\n",
