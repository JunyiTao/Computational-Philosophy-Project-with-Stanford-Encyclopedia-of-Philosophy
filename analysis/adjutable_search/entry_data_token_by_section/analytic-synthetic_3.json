    "main_text": "High Hopes\n2. High Hopes\n\nInfluenced by these developments in logic, many philosophers in the\nfirst half of the Twentieth Century thought analyticity could perform\ncrucial epistemological work not only in accounting for our apparently\na priori knowledge of mathematics, but also \u2014with a\nlittle help from British empiricism\u2014of our understanding of\nclaims about the spatiotemporal world as well. Indeed,\n\u201canalysis\u201d and the \u201clinguistic turn\u201d (Rorty,\n1992) soon came to constitute the very way many Anglophone\nphilosophers characterized their work, particularly since such\nanalyses of what we mean by our words seemed to be the sort of\nenterprise available to \u201carmchair reflection\u201d that seemed\nto many a distinctive feature of that work (see Haug, 2014). Many\nthought this project would also perform the more metaphysical\nwork of explaining the truth and necessity of\nmathematics, showing not only how it is we could know about\nthese topics independently of experience, but how they could be\ntrue in this and in all possible worlds, usually, though,\nwithout distinguishing this project from the epistemic one. Thus,\nGilbert Harman (1967 [1999] begins his review of the topic combining\nthe two projects:\n\n\nWhat I shall call a \u2018full-blooded theory of analytic\ntruth\u2019 takes the analytic truths to be those that hold solely by\nvirtue of meaning or that are knowable solely by virtue of meaning.\n(p. 119, see also p. 127),\n\n\ntaking himself to be expressing the views of a number of other then\ncontemporary philosophers.\n\nThis seemed like a grand unified plan until Saul Kripke (1972) and\nHilary Putnam (1975) drew attention to fundamental differences between\nthe metaphysical and epistemic modalities that had tended to be run\ntogether throughout this period. They pointed out that, for example,\n\u201cwater is H2O\u201d might well be necessarily true,\nbut not knowable a priori, and \u201cThe meter stick in\nParis is one meter long\u201d might be knowable a priori but\nnot be necessarily true (that very stick might have been broken and\nnever used for measurements; see A Priori Justification and\nKnowledge).\n\nOnce the metaphysical and epistemic issues are separated, it becomes\nless obvious that mere matters of meaning could really explain all\nnecessities. Recall that Frege\u2019s ambition had been to\nreduce mathematics to logic by showing how, substituting synonyms for\nsynonyms, every mathematical truth could be shown to be a logical one.\nHe hadn\u2019t gone on to claim that the logical truths\nthemselves were true or necessary by virtue of meaning alone.\nThese were \u201cLaws of Truth\u201d (Frege, 1918/84:58), and it\nwasn\u2019t clear what sort of explanation could be provided for\nthem. Obviously, appealing merely to further synonym substitutions\nwouldn\u2019t suffice. As Michael Devitt (1993a) pointed out:\n\n\nthe sentence \u2018All bachelors are unmarried\u2019 is not true\nsolely in virtue of meaning and so is not analytic in the\u2026sense\n[of true in virtue of meaning alone]. The sentence is indeed true\npartly in virtue of the fact that \u2018unmarried\u2019 must refer\nto anything that \u2018bachelor\u2019 refers to but it is also true\npartly in virtue of the truth of \u2018All unmarrieds are\nunmarried.\u2019 (Devitt 1993a, p. 287; cf., Quine 1956 [1976], p.\n118)\n\n\nIt was certainly not clear that the truth of \u201cAll unmarrieds are\nunmarrieds\u201d is based on the same sort of arbitrary synonymy\nfacts that underlie \u201cAll bachelors are unmarried.\u201d In any\nevent, a different kind of account seemed to be needed (see\n footnotes 9 and 16).\n\nJerrold Katz and Paul Postal (1991, pp. 516\u20137) did claim that\nadequate linguistic theory should, inter alia, explain why,\nif John killed Bill is true, then so is Bill is\ndead. However, as David Israel (1991) pointed out in reply:\n\u201cthere are facts about English, about what propositions are\nexpressed by certain utterances, and then there is a non-linguistic\nfact: that one proposition entails another\u201d (p. 571). Utterances\nof sentences are one thing; the propositions (or\nthoughts) many different sentences may express,\nquite another, and the two shouldn\u2019t be confused:\n\n\nIt is just not true that if the proposition expressed by [an\nutterance of John killed Bill] is true that, then \u201cin\nvirtue of [natural language] so, necessarily, is\u201d the\nproposition expressed by [an utterance of Bill is\ndead]. Rather, if the proposition that, according to the grammar\nof English, is expressed by [an utterance of John killed\nBill] is true, then, in virtue of the structure of the\npropositions concerned, the proposition that,\naccording to the grammar of English, is expressed by [an utterance of\nBill is dead] must also be true.--(D. Israel, 1991, p. 71,\nemphasis added)\n\n\nProviding the metaphysical basis for logical truth is a fine issue\n(see Logical Truth), but as Devitt (1993a and b) and others\n(e.g., Paul Boghossian, 1996, Williamson, 2007) went on to stress, it\nhas been the epistemological issues about justifying our\nbeliefs in necessary truths that have dominated philosophical\ndiscussions of the analytic in the last seventy\n years.[4]\n Consequently, we will focus primarily on this more modest,\nepistemological project in the remainder of this entry.\n",
