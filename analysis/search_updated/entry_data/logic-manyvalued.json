    "preamble": "\n\n\nMany-valued logics are non-classical logics. They are similar to\nclassical logic because they accept the principle of\ntruth-functionality, namely, that the truth of a compound sentence is\ndetermined by the truth values of its component sentences (and so\nremains unaffected when one of its component sentences is replaced by\nanother sentence with the same truth value). But they differ from\nclassical logic by the fundamental fact that they do not restrict the\nnumber of truth values to only two: they allow for a larger set\n\\(W\\) of truth degrees.\n Just as the notion of \u2018possible worlds\u2019 in the\nsemantics of modal logic can be reinterpreted (e.g., as \u2018moments\nof time\u2019 in the semantics of tense logic or as\n\u2018states\u2019 in the semantics of dynamic logic), there does\nnot exist a standard interpretation of the truth degrees. How they are\nto be understood depends on the actual field of application. It is\ngeneral usage, however, to assume that there are two particular truth\ndegrees, usually denoted by \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d. These\nparticular truth degrees act, respectively, like the traditional truth\nvalues \u201cfalsum\u201d and \u201cverum\u201d \u2013 but\nsometimes also like \u201cabsolutely false\u201d and\n\u201cabsolutely true\u201d, particularly in cases in which the\ntraditional truth values of classical logic \u201csplit\u201d into a\nseries of truth degrees.\n\nMany-valued logics treat their truth degrees as technical tools, and\nintend to choose them suitably for particular applications. It is a\nrather difficult philosophical problem to discuss the (possible,\nnon-technical) nature of such \u201ctruth degrees\u201d or\n\u201ctruth values\u201d. The interested reader can consult the\nmonograph Shramko/Wansing (2011) or the entry on \n truth values.\n\n\nThe formalized languages for systems of many-valued logic\n(MVL) follow the two standard patterns for propositional and predicate\nlogic, respectively:\n\nthere are propositional variables\ntogether with connectives and (possibly also) truth degree constants in\nthe case of propositional languages,\n\nthere are object variables together with predicate symbols, possibly\nalso object constants and function symbols, as well as quantifiers,\nconnectives, and (possibly also) truth degree constants in the case of\nfirst-order languages.\n\n\n\nAs usual in logic, these languages are the basis for semantically as\nwell as syntactically founded systems of logic.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1.  Semantics\n\n\nThere are three kinds of semantics for systems of many-valued\nlogic.\n\n1.1 Standard Logical Matrices\n1.2 Algebraic Semantics\n1.3 Game Semantics\n\n\n\nWe discuss these in turn.\n1.1  Standard Logical Matrices\n\n\nThe most suitable way of defining a system \\(\\bS\\) of\nmany-valued logic is to fix the characteristic logical matrix for its\nlanguage, i.e. to fix:\n\nthe set of truth degrees,\nthe truth degree functions which\ninterpret the propositional connectives,\nthe meaning of the truth degree\nconstants,\nthe semantical interpretation of the quantifiers,\n\n\n\nand additionally,\n\nthe designated truth degrees, which form a subset of the\nset of truth degrees and act as substitutes for the traditional truth\nvalue \u201cverum\u201d,\nand occasionally also anti-designated truth degrees, which\nform a subset of the set of truth degrees and act as substitutes for\nthe traditional truth value \u201cfalsum\u201d.\n\n\n\nA well-formed formula \\(A\\) of a propositional language counts\nas valid under some valuation \\(\\alpha\\) (which maps the set of\npropositional variables into the set of truth degrees) iff it has a\ndesignated truth degree under \\(\\alpha\\). And \\(A\\) is logically\nvalid or a tautology iff it is valid under all\nvaluations.\n\n\nIn the case of a first-order language, such a well-formed formula\n\\(A\\) counts as valid under an interpretation \\(\\alpha\\) of\nthe language iff it has a designated truth degree under this\ninterpretation and all assignments of objects from the universe of\ndiscourse of this interpretation to the object variables. \\(A\\)\ncounts as logically valid iff it is valid under all\ninterpretations.\n\n\nLike in classical logic, such an interpretation has to provide\n\na (non empty) universe of discourse,\nthe meaning of the object constants of\nthe language,\nthe meaning of the predicate letters and the function symbols of the\nlanguage.\n\n\n\nA model of some set \\(\\Sigma\\) of well-formed formulas is a\nvaluation \\(\\alpha\\) or an interpretation \\(\\alpha\\) such that all \\(A\\)\n\u2208 \\(\\Sigma\\) are valid under \\(\\alpha\\) . That \\(\\Sigma\\) entails\n\\(A\\) means that each model of \\(\\Sigma\\) is also a model of\n\\(A\\).\n1.2 Algebraic Semantics\n\n\nThere is a second type of semantics for systems \\(\\bS\\)\nof many-valued logic which is based on a whole characteristic class\n\\(\\bK\\) of (similar) algebraic structures. Each such\nalgebraic structure has to provide all the data which have to be\nprovided by a characteristic logical matrix for the language of\n\\(\\bS\\).\n\n\nThe notion of validity of a formula \\(A\\) with respect to an\nalgebraic structure from \\(\\bK\\) is defined as if this\nstructure would form a logical matrix. And logical validity\nhere means validity for all structures from the class\n\\(\\bK\\).\n\n\nThe type of algebraic structures which form such a characteristic\nclass \\(\\bK\\) for some system \\(\\bS\\) of MVL\nusually may come from two different sources. A first source may be\ndetermined by extralogical considerations which distinguish some such\nclass of algebraic structures. If a system \\(\\bS\\) of MVL\nis, however, determined syntactically or by a single characteristic\nmatrix, such a class of algebraic structures often is determined by the\n(syntactical or semantical) Lindenbaum algebra of \\(\\bS\\),\nand in such a case often plays also a crucial role within an algebraic\ncompleteness proof. The algebraic structures in \\(\\bK\\) have\na similar role for \\(\\bS\\) as the Boolean algebras do for\nclassical logic.\n\n\nFor particular systems of MVL one has e.g. the following\ncharacteristic classes of algebraic structures:\n\nfor infinite valued \u0141ukasiewicz logic the class of\nMV-algebras,\nfor infinite valued G\u00f6del logic the class of all\nHeyting algebras which additionally satisfy prelinearity \n\\((x \\rightarrow y) \\cup (y \\rightarrow x) = 1,\\)\nfor Hajek\u2019s basic t-norm logic BL the class of all\nt-algebras, i.e. all those algebraic structures which are formed by the \nreal unit interval together with a left-continuous t-norm \\(T\\) and \ntheir residuation operation \\(I_{T}\\) defined as \n\\(I_{T}(x,y) =  \\sup \\{z\\mid T(x,z) \\le y\\}.\\)\n\n\n\nFor the first two of these examples one has, historically, the logic\ndetermined by a characteristic matrix, and the corresponding class of\nalgebraic structures determined later on. For the third example the\nsituation is different: BL was designed to be the logic of all\ncontinuous t-norms, and from this extralogical approach the class of\nall divisible residuated lattices which satisfy prelinearity was\nfound.\n\n\nFrom a philosophical point of view, however, it usually would be\npreferable to have a semantic foundation for a system of MVL which uses\na single characteristic logical matrix. But, from a formal point of\nview, both approaches are equally important, and the algebraic\nsemantics turns out to be the more general approach.\n1.3 Game Semantics\n\nThere are various ways in which\n logic and games can be related.\n Dialogical logic, e.g.,\n offers a game-theoretic semantics for classical as\nwell as for intuitionistic logic: a formula counts as valid if a\nproponent who states this formula has a winning strategy over possible\nattacks an opponent is allowed to realize.\n\n\nIn the context of the relationship between fuzzy sets and many-valued\nlogic, an approach toward a game-oriented look at logical validity was\noffered by Robin Giles. Starting in 1975, he proposed in a series of\npapers Giles (1975,1976,1979), and again in Giles (1988), a general\ntreatment of reasoning with vague predicates by means of a formal\nsystem based upon a convenient dialogue interpretation. He had already\nused this dialogue interpretation in other papers, such as Giles 1974,\nwhich deals with subjective belief and the foundations of physics. The\nmain idea is to let \u201ca sentence represent a belief by\nexpressing it tangibly in the form of a bet\u201d.  The betting\nconcerns the actual outcomes of dispersive experiments with different\npossible results of known probability. In this setting then a\n\u201csentence \\(\\psi\\) is considered to follow from sentences\n\\(\\phi_{1},\\ldots,\\phi_{n}\\) just when he who accepts\nthe bets \\(\\phi_{1},\\ldots,\\phi_{n}\\) can at the same\ntime bet \\(\\psi\\) without fear of loss\u201d.\n\n\nThe (formal) language obtained in this way is closely related to\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s infinite-valued logic \\(\\rL_{\\infty}\\): in fact\nthe two systems coincide if one assigns to a sentence \\(\\phi\\) the truth\nvalue \\(1-\\langle\\phi\\rangle\\), with \\(\\langle\\phi \\rangle\\) for the risk\nvalue of asserting \\(\\phi\\). And he even adds the remark \u201cthat,\nwith this dialogue interpretation, \u0141ukasiewicz logic is exactly\nappropriate for the formulation of the \u2018fuzzy set theory\u2019\nfirst described by L.A. Zadeh (1965); indeed, it is not too much to\nclaim that \\(\\rL_{\\infty}\\) is related to fuzzy set theory exactly\nas classical logic is related to ordinary set theory\u201d.\n\n\nDifferent versions and generalizations of these dialogue games have\nbeen studied recently. Various aspects of these developments are\ndiscuss, e.g., in Ferm\u00fcller (2008) and Ferm\u00fcller/Roschger\n(2014). Such approaches are not only able to provide game semantics\nfor e.g. G\u00f6del logics and product logic. There are also bridges\nwhich connect such games with the design of sequent calculi for\nmany-valued logics, cf. Ferm\u00fcller/Metcalfe (2009).\n\n\nThere is also a further type of dialogue games related to\n\\(m\\)-valued \u0141ukasiewicz logic: a proponent is asking for\ninformation, and the answering opponent is allowed to lie up to\n\\(m\\) times. Such \u201cUlam games with lies\u201d have been\nintroduced by Mundici (1992).\n2. Proof Theory\n\n\nThe main types of logical calculi are all available for systems of\nMVL:\n\n2.1 Hilbert type calculi\n2.2 Gentzen type sequent calculi\n2.3 Tableau calculi\n\n\n\nHowever, some of the above are available only for finitely valued\nsystems. The present state of the art for a wide class of infinitely\nvalued logics is presented in Metcalfe/Olivetti/Gabbay (2009).\n2.1 Hilbert type calculi\n\n\nThese calculi are formed in the same way as the corresponding\ncalculi for classical logic: some set of axioms is used\ntogether with a set of inference rules. The notion of\nderivation is the usual one.\n2.2  Gentzen type sequent calculi\n\n\nIn addition to the usual types of sequent calculi, researchers have\nalso recently started to discuss \u2018hypersequent\u2019 calculi for\nsystems of MVL. Hypersequents are finite multisets, i.e. finite unordered lists of ordinary\nsequents.\n\n\nFor finitely valued systems, particularly \\(m\\)-valued ones,\nthere are also sequent calculi which work with generalized\nsequents. In the \\(m\\)-valued case, these are sequences of\nlength \\(m\\) of sets of formulas.\n2.3  Tableau calculi\n\n\nThe tree structure of the tableaux remains the same in these calculi\nas in the tableau calculi for classical logic. The labels of the nodes\nbecome more general objects, namely, signed formulas. A signed\nformula is a pair, consisting of a sign and a well-formed\nformula. A sign is either a truth degree, or a set of truth\ndegrees.\n\n\nTableau calculi with signed formulas are usually restricted to\nfinite-valued systems of MVL, so that they can be dealt with in an\neffective way.\n3.  Systems of Many-Valued Logic\n\n\nThe main systems of MVL often come as families which comprise\nuniformly defined finite-valued as well as infinite-valued systems.\nHere is a list:\n\n3.1 \u0141ukasiewicz logics \n3.2 G\u00f6del logics\n3.3 t-Norm based systems\n3.4 Three-valued systems\n3.5 Dunn/Belnap\u2019s 4-valued system\n3.6 Product systems\n\n3.1  \u0141ukasiewicz logics\n\n\nThe systems \\(\\rL_{m}\\) and \\(\\rL_{\\infty}\\) are\ndefined by the logical matrix which has either some finite set\n\n\\[\nW_{m} = \\{\\tfrac{k}{m - 1}  \\mid  0 \\le k \\le m - 1\\}\n\\]\n\n\n\nof rationals within the real unit interval, or the whole unit\ninterval\n\n\\[\nW_{\\infty} = [0,1] = \\{x \\in \\Re \\mid 0 \\le x \\le 1\\}\n\\]\n\n\n\nas the truth degree set. The degree 1 is the only designated truth\ndegree.\n\n\nThe main connectives of these systems are a strong and a weak\nconjunction, \\(\\amp\\) and \\(\\wedge\\), respectively, given by the truth degree\nfunctions\n\n\\begin{align}\n  u \\amp v &= \\max \\{0, u + v-1\\}, \\\\\nu \\wedge v &= \\min \\{u,v\\},\n\\end{align}\n\n\n\na negation connective \\(\\neg\\) determined by\n\n\\[\n\\neg u = 1-u,\n\\]\n\n\n\nand an implication connective \\(\\rightarrow\\) with truth degree function\n\n\\[\nu \\rightarrow v = \\min\\{1, 1-u + v\\}.\n\\]\n\n\n\nOften, two disjunction connectives are also used. These are defined in\nterms of \\(\\amp\\) and \\(\\wedge\\), respectively, via the usual de\nMorgan laws using \\(\\neg\\). For the first-order \u0141ukasiewicz systems\none adds two quantifiers \\(\\forall\\), \\(\\exists\\) in such a way that the\ntruth degree of \\(\\forall xH(x)\\) is the infimum of all\nthe relevant truth degrees of \\(H(x)\\), and that the truth degree\nof \\(\\exists xH(x)\\) is the supremum of all the relevant\ntruth degrees of \\(H(x)\\).\n3.2 G\u00f6del logics\n\n\nThe systems \\(\\rG_{m}\\) and \\(\\rG_{\\infty}\\) are\ndefined by the logical matrix which has either some finite set\n\n\\[\nW_{m} = \\{\\tfrac{k}{m - 1}  \\mid  0 \\le k \\le m - 1\\}\n\\]\n\n\n\nof rationals within the real unit interval, or the whole unit\ninterval\n\n\\[\nW_{\\infty} = [0,1] = \\{x \\in \\Re \\mid 0 \\le x \\le 1\\}\n\\]\n\n\n\nas the truth degree set. The degree 1 is the only designated truth\ndegree.\n\n\nThe main connectives of these systems are a conjunction \\(\\wedge\\) and a\ndisjunction \\(\\vee\\) determined by the truth degree functions\n\n\\begin{align}\nu \\wedge v &= \\min \\{u,v\\}, \\\\\nu \\vee v &= \\max \\{u,v\\},\n\\end{align}\n\n\n\nan implication connective \\(\\rightarrow\\)  with truth degree function\n\n\n\n\\(u\\rightarrow v\\)\n\n\n\\(u\\le v\\)\n1\n\n\n\\(u\\gt v\\)\n\\(v\\)\n\n\n\n\nand a negation connective \\(\\sim\\) with truth degree function\n\n\n\n\\({\\sim}u\\)\n\n\n\\(u=0\\)\n1\n\n\n\\(u\\ne 0\\)\n0\n\n\n\n\nFor the first-order G\u00f6del systems one adds two quantifiers\n\\(\\forall\\), \\(\\exists\\) in such a way that the truth degree of\n\\(\\forall xH(x)\\) is the infimum of all the\nrelevant truth degrees of \\(H(x)\\), and that the truth\ndegree of \\(\\exists xH(x)\\) is the supremum of\nall the relevant truth degrees of \\(H(x)\\).\n3.3 t-Norm based systems\n\n\nFor infinite valued systems with truth degree set\n\n\\[\nW_{\\infty} = [0,1] = \\{x \\in \\Re \\mid 0 \\le x \\le 1\\}\n\\]\n\n\n\nthe influence of fuzzy set theory since the mid-1980s initiated the study\nof a whole class of such systems of MVL.\n\n\nThese systems are basically determined by a (possibly\nnon-idempotent) strong conjunction connective \\(\\amp_{\\rT}\\) which\nhas as corresponding truth degree function a t-norm \\(\\rT\\), i.e. a\nbinary operation \\(\\rT\\) in the unit interval which is associative,\ncommutative, non-decreasing, and has the degree 1 as a neutral\nelement:\n\n\\begin{align}\n& \\rT(u,\\rT(v,w)) = \\rT(\\rT(u,v),w), \\\\\n& \\rT(u,v) = \\rT(v,u),\\\\\n& u \\le v \\rightarrow \\rT(u,w) \\le \\rT(v,w),\\\\\n& \\rT(u,1) = u.\n\\end{align}\n\n\n\nFor all those t-norms which have the sup-preservation\nproperty\n\n\\[\n\\rT(u, {\\sup}_{i} v_{i}) = {\\sup}_{i} \\rT(u,v_{i}),\n\\]\n\n\n\nthere is a standard way to introduce a related implication\nconnective \\(\\rightarrow_{\\rT}\\) with the truth degree function\n\n\\[\nu \\rightarrow_{\\rT} v = \\sup \\{z \\mid \\rT(u,z) \\le v\\}.\n\\]\n\n\n\nThis implication connective is connected with the t-norm \\(\\rT\\) by the\ncrucial adjointness condition\n\n\\[\n\\rT(u,v) \\le w \\Leftrightarrow u \\le (v \\rightarrow_{\\rT} w),\n\\]\n\n\n\nwhich determines \\(\\rightarrow_{\\rT}\\) uniquely for each \\(\\rT\\) with\nsup-preservation property.\n\n\nThe language is further enriched with a negation connective,\n\\(-_{\\rT}\\), determined by the truth degree function\n\n\\[\n-_{\\rT} u = u \\rightarrow_{\\rT} 0.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nThis forces the language to have also a truth degree constant\n\\(\\uO\\) to denote the truth degree 0 because then \\(-_{\\rT}\\)\nbecomes a definable connective.\n\n\nUsually one adds as two further connectives a (weak) conjunction\n\\(\\wedge\\) and a disjunction \\(\\vee\\) with truth degree functions.\n\n\\begin{align}\nu \\wedge v &= \\min \\{u,v\\}, \\\\\nu \\vee v &= \\max \\{u,v\\},\n\\end{align}\n\n\n\nFor t-norms which are continuous functions (in the standard sense of\ncontinuity for real functions of two variables) these additional\nconnectives become even definable. Suitable definitions are\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\min \\{u,v\\} &= \\rT(u, (u \\rightarrow_{\\rT} v)) , \\\\\n\\max \\{u,v\\} &= \\min \\{ ((u \\rightarrow_{\\rT} v) \\rightarrow_{\\rT} v), \n ((v\\rightarrow_{\\rT} u) \\rightarrow_{\\rT} u) \\}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\n\nParticular cases of such t-norm related systems are the infinite\nvalued \u0141ukasiewicz and G\u00f6del systems \\(\\rL_{\\infty}\\),\n\\(\\rG_{\\infty}\\), and also the product logic which has the\nusual arithmetic product as its basic t-norm.\n\n\nFrom an analytical point of view, for a t-norm \\(\\rT\\) their\nsup-preservation property is the left-continuity of this binary\nfunction \\(\\rT\\), i.e. the property that each one of the unary\nfunctions \\(\\rT_{a}(x)=\\rT(a,x)\\) is left-continuous. And the\ncontinuity of such a t-norm T can be characterized through the\nalgebraic divisibility condition\n\n\\[\nu \\amp_{\\rT} (u\\rightarrow_{\\rT} v) = u \\wedge v.\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe class of all t-norms is very large, and up to now not really\nwell understood. Even for those t-norms which have the sup-preservation\nproperty the structural understanding is far from complete, but much\nbetter as for the general case: a discussion of the recent state of the\nart is given by Jenei (2004). Sufficiently well understood is only the\nfurther subclass of continuous t-norms: they are nicely composed out of\nisomorphic copies of the \u0141ukasiewicz t-norm, the product t-norm,\nand the G\u00f6del t-norm, i.e. the min-operation, as explained e.g. in\nGottwald (2001).\n\n\nActually one is able to axiomatize t-norm based systems for some\nparticular classes of t-norms. As a fundamental result, H\u00e1jek\n(1998) has given an axiomatization of the logic BL of all continuous\nt-norms. Besides the previously mentioned algebraic semantics this\nlogic has, as conjectured by Hajek and proved in\nCignoli/Esteva/Godo/Torrens (2000), as another algebraic semantics the\nclass of all t-norm based structures whose t-norm is a continuous\nfunction. Based upon this work, Esteva and Godo (2001) conjectured an\naxiomatization for the logic MTL of all t-norms which have the\nsup-preservation property, and Jenei/Montagna (2002) proved that this\nreally is an adequate axiomatization. And Esteva/Godo/Montagna (2004)\noffer a method to axiomatize the logic of each single continuous t-norm: \nthey provide an algorithm which gives for each particular continuous t-norm\n\\(\\rT\\) a finite list of axiom schemata which, if added to the logic BL\nof all continuous t-norms, yield an adequate axiomatization of the particular \nt-norm based logic for \\(\\rT\\).\n\n\nThe axiomatization of further t-norm based systems, as well as the\nquestion for t-norm based quantifiers, are recent research problems.\nThe main focus is given by the following two aspects which concern\nmodifications of the expressive power of these t-norm based systems:\n(i) strengthenings of this expressibility by forming systems with\nadditional negation operators or with multiple t-norm based conjunction\noperations; (ii) modifications of this expressibility e.g. by deleting\nthe truth degree constant \\(\\uO\\) from the language, but adding an\nimplication connective to the basic vocabulary, and (iii)\ngeneralizations which modify the basic t-norms into non-commutative\n\u201cpseudo-t-norms\u201d and thus lead to logics with\nnon-commutative conjunction connectives. Surveys for those developments\nhad been given by Gottwald/H\u00e1jek (2005), Gottwald (2008), and\nCintula/H\u00e1jek (2010). \n A nearly complete presentation of the state of the art in 2011 is\nthe monograph Cintula/H\u00e1jek/Noguera (2011). And the particular\ncontributions of P. H\u00e1jek to these developments are honored in\nthe book Montagna (2015). \n3.4 Three-valued systems\n\n\n3-valued systems seem to be particularly simple cases which offer\nintuitive interpretations of the truth degrees; these systems include\nonly one additional degree besides the classical truth values.\n\n\nThe mathematician and logician Kleene used a third truth degree for\n\u201cundefined\u201d in the context of partial recursive\nfunctions. His connectives were the negation, the weak conjunction,\nand the weak disjunction of the 3-valued \u0141ukasiewicz system\ntogether with a definable conjunction \\(\\wedge_{+}\\) and a definable\nimplication \\(\\rightarrow_{+}\\) determined by truth degree functions\nwith the following function tables (these latter have truth degree\n\u00bd iff one of their constituents has truth degree \u00bd):\n\n\n\\(\\wedge_{+}\\)\n0\n\u00bd\n1\n\n\n0\n0\n\u00bd\n0\n\n\n\u00bd\n\u00bd\n\u00bd\n\u00bd\n\n\n1\n0\n\u00bd\n1\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\rightarrow_{+}\\)\n0\n\u00bd\n1\n\n\n0\n1\n\u00bd\n1\n\n\n\u00bd\n\u00bd\n\u00bd\n\u00bd\n\n\n1\n0\n\u00bd\n1\n\n\n\n\nHere \u00bd is the third truth degree \u201cundefined\u201d. In\nthis Kleene system, the degree 1 is the only designated truth\ndegree.\n Blau (1978) used a different system as an inherent logic of\nnatural language. In Blau\u2019s system, both degrees 1 and \u00bd are\ndesignated.  Other interpretations of the third truth degree \u00bd,\nfor example as \u201csenseless\u201d, \u201cundetermined\u201d, or\n\u201cparadoxical\u201d, motivated the study of other 3-valued\nsystems.\n3.5 Dunn/Belnap\u2019s 4-valued system\n\n\nThis particularly interesting system of MVL was the result of\nresearch on\n relevance logic,\n but it\nalso has significance for computer science applications. Its truth\ndegree set may be taken as\n\n\\[\nW^* = \\{\\varnothing, \\{\\bot\\}, \\{\\top\\}, \\{\\bot, \\top\\}\\},\n\\]\n\n\n\nand the truth degrees interpreted as indicating (e.g. with respect\nto a database query for some particular state of affairs) that there\nis\n\nno information concerning this state of\naffairs,\ninformation saying that the state of\naffairs fails,\ninformation saying that the state of\naffairs obtains,\nconflicting information saying that the state of affairs obtains as\nwell as fails.\n\n\n\nThis set of truth degrees has two natural (lattice) orderings:\n\na truth ordering which has \\(\\{\\top\\}\\) on top of the\nincomparable degrees \\(\\varnothing\\), \\(\\{\\bot , \\top\\}\\), and has\n\\(\\{\\bot\\}\\) at the bottom; i.e.,\n\n\n\n\n\nan information (or: knowledge) ordering\nwhich has \\(\\{\\bot , \\top\\}\\) on top of the incomparable degrees \\(\\{\\bot\n\\}, \\{\\top\\}\\), and has \\(\\varnothing\\) at the bottom; i.e.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the inf and the sup under the truth ordering, there are truth\ndegree functions for a conjunction and a disjunction connective. A\nnegation is, in a natural way, determined by a truth degree function\nwhich exchanges the degrees \\(\\{\\bot\\}\\) and \\(\\{\\top\\}\\), and which leaves\nthe degrees \\(\\{\\bot, \\top\\}\\) and \\(\\varnothing\\) fixed.\n\n\nActually, there is no standard candidate for a implication\nconnective, and the choice of the designated truth degrees depends on\nthe intended applications:\n\nfor computer science applications it is\nnatural to have \\(\\{\\top\\}\\) as the only designated degree,\nfor applications to relevance logic the choice of \\(\\{\\top\\}\\), \\(\\{\\bot\n, \\top\\}\\) as designated degrees proved to be adequate.\n\n\n\nThe choice of suitable entailment relations is still an open\nresearch topic.\n\n\nThis 4-valued system has an interesting interpretation in the\ncontext of information bases stored in a computer which was explained by\nBelnap (1977). A more recent generalization by Shramko/Wansing (2005) to\nknowledge bases in computer networks leads to 16-valued systems, which\nare e.g. also studied by Odintsov (2009).\n \n\nThese 16-valued systems are also of interest from a philosophical\npoint of view and extensively presented in the monograph\nShramko/Wansing (2011).\n3.6  Product systems\n\n\nThe general problem of finding an intuitive understanding of the\ntruth degrees occasionally has a nice solution: one can consider them\nas comprising different aspects of the evaluation of sentences. In such\na case of, say, \\(k\\) different aspects the truth degrees may be\nchosen as \\(k\\)-tuples of values which evaluate the single\naspects. (And these, e.g., may be standard truth values.)\n\n\nThe truth degree functions over such \\(k\\)-tuples additionally\ncan be defined \u201ccomponentwise\u201d from truth degree (or: truth value)\nfunctions for the values of the single components. In this manner,\n\\(k\\) logical systems may be combined into one many-valued\nproduct system.\n\n\nIn this way, the truth degrees of Dunn/Belnap\u2019s 4-valued system can\nbe considered as evaluating two aspects of a state of affairs (SOA)\nrelated to a database:\n\nwhether there is positive information\nabout the truth of this SOA or not, and\nwhether there is positive information about the falsity of this SOA\nor not.\n\n\n\nBoth aspects can use standard truth values for this evaluation.\n\n\nIn this case, the conjunction, disjunction, and negation of\nDunn/Belnap\u2019s 4-valued system are componentwise definable by\nconjunction, disjunction, or negation, respectively, of classical\nlogic, i.e. this 4-valued system is a product of two copies of\nclassical two-valued logic.\n4. Applications of Many-Valued Logic\n\n\nMany-valued logic was motivated in part by philosophical goals which\nwere never achieved, and in part by formal considerations concerning\nfunctional completeness. In the earlier years of development, this\ncaused some doubts about the usefulness of MVL. In the meantime,\nhowever, interesting applications were found in diverse fields. Some of\nthese shall now be mentioned.\n\n4.1 Applications to Linguistics\n4.2 Applications to Logic\n4.3 Applications to Philosophical Problems\n4.4 Applications to Hardware Design\n4.5 Applications to Artificial Intelligence\n4.6 Applications to Mathematics\n\n4.1  Applications to Linguistics\n\n\nA challenging problem is the treatment of presuppositions in\nlinguistics, i.e. of assumptions that are only implicit in a given\nsentence. So, for example, the sentence \u201cThe present king of Canada was\nborn in Vienna\u201d has the existential presupposition that there\nis a present king of Canada.\n\n\nIt is not a simple task to understand the propositional treatment of\nsuch sentences, e.g. to give criteria for forming their negation, or\nunderstanding the truth conditions of implications.\n\n\nOne type of solution for these problems refers to the use of many\ntruth degrees, e.g. to product systems with ordered pairs as\ntruth degrees: meaning that their components evaluate in parallel\nwhether the presupposition is met, and whether the sentence is true or\nfalse. But 3-valued approaches have also been discussed.\n\n\nAnother type of ideas to use MVL tools in linguistics consists in\napproaches toward the modeling of natural language phenomena. Basic\nideas and some applications are offered e.g. in\nNov\u00e1k/Perfilieva/ Mo\u010dko\u0159 (1999) and Nov\u00e1k\n(2008).\n4.2 Applications to Logic\n\n\nA first type of application of systems of MVL to logic itself is to\nuse them to gain a better understanding of other systems of logic. In\nthis way the G\u00f6del systems arose out of an approach to test\nwhether intuitionistic logic may be understood as a finitely valued\nlogic. The introduction of systems of MVL by \u0141ukasiewicz (1920)\nwas initially guided by the (finally unsuccessful) idea of\nunderstanding the notion of possibility, i.e. modal logic, in a\n3-valued way.\n\n\nA second type of application to logic is the merging of different\ntypes of logical systems, e.g. the formulation of systems with graded\nmodalities. Melvin Fitting (1991/92) considers systems that define such\nmodalities by merging modal and many-valued logic, with intended\napplications to problems of Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\nA third type of application to logic is the modeling of partial\npredicates and truth value gaps. However, this is possible only in so\nfar as these truth value gaps behave \u201ctruth functionally\u201d, i.e. in so\nfar as the behavior of the truth value gaps in compound sentences can\nbe described by suitable truth functions. (This is not always the case,\ne.g. it is not the case in formulations which use\nsupervaluations.)\n4.3  Applications to Philosophical Problems\n\n\nHow to understand the meaning of \u201ctruth\u201d is an old philosophical\nproblem. A logical approach toward this problem consists in enriching a\nformalized language \\(L\\) with a truth predicate \\(T\\), to be\napplied to sentences of \\(L\\) \u2013 or, even better, to be\napplied to sentences of the extension \\(L_{T}\\)\nof \\(L\\) with the predicate \\(T\\).\n\n\nBased upon this idea, a reasonable theory of such languages which\ncontain truth predicates was developed in the mid-1930s by A. Tarski.\nOne of the results was that such a language\n\\(L_{T}\\), which contains its own truth predicate\n\\(T\\) and has a certain richness in expressive power, is\nnecessarily inconsistent.\n\n\nAnother approach toward such languages \\(L_{T}\\) which contain their\nown truth predicate \\(T\\) was offered by S. Kripke (1975) and is\nessentially based upon the idea of considering \\(T\\) as a partial\npredicate, i.e. as a predicate which has \u201ctruth value\ngaps\u201d. In a case Kripke (1975) considers, these truth value gaps\nbehave \u201ctruth functionally\u201d and so can be treated like a\nthird truth degree. Their propagation in compound sentences then\nbecomes describable by suitable truth degree functions of three-valued\nsystems. In Kripke\u2019s (1975) approach this reference was to\nthree-valued systems which S. C. Kleene (1938) had considered in the\n(mathematical) context of partial functions and predicates in\nrecursion theory.\n\n\nA second application of MVL inside philosophy is to the old paradoxes\nlike the Sorites (heap) or the falakros (bald\nman). (See the entry\n Sorites paradox.)\n In the case of the Sorites, the paradox is as\nfollows:\n(i) One grain of sand is not a heap of sand. And (ii)\nadding one grain of sand to something which is not a heap does not turn\nit into a heap. Hence (iii) a single grain of sand can never turn into\na heap of sand, no matter how many grains of sand are added to\nit.\n\n\nThus the true premise (i) gives a false conclusion (iii) via a\nsequence of inferences using (ii). A rather natural solution inside an\nextension of MVL with a graded notion of inference, often called\nfuzzy logic, is to take the notion of heap as a vague\none, i.e. as a notion which may hold true of given objects only to some\n(truth) degree. Additionally it is suitable to consider premise (ii) as\nonly partially true, however to a degree which is quite near to the\nmaximal degree 1. Then each single inference step is of the form:\n\n\n(a)\\(k\\) grains of sand do not make a heap.\n(ii)Adding one grain of sand to \\(k\\) grains does\n      not make \\((k+1)\\) grains into a heap.\nHence\n(b)\\((k+1)\\) grains of sand do not make a heap.\n\n\nHowever, this inference has to involve truth degrees for the\npremises (a) and (ii), and has to provide a truth degree for the\nconclusion (b). The crucial idea for the modeling of this type of\nreasoning inside MVL is to make sure that the truth degree for (b) is\nsmaller than the truth degree for (a) in case the truth degree for (ii)\nis smaller than the maximal one. In effect, then, the sentence \\(n\\)\ngrains of sand do not make a heap tends toward being false for an\nincreasing number \\(n\\) of grains.\n4.4 Applications to Hardware Design\n\n\nClassical propositional logic is used as a technical tool for the\nanalysis and synthesis of some types of electrical circuits built up\nfrom \u201cswitches\u201d with two stable states, i.e. voltage\nlevels. A rather straightforward generalization allows the use of\nan \\(m\\)-valued logic to discuss circuits built from similar\n\u201cswitches\u201d with \\(m\\) stable states. This whole field\nof application of many-valued logic is called many-valued (or even:\nfuzzy) switching. A good introduction is Epstein (1993).\n4.5  Applications to Artificial Intelligence\n\n\nAI is actually the most promising field of applications, which\noffers a series of different areas in which systems of MVL have been\nused.\n\n\nA first area of application concerns vague notions and commonsense\nreasoning, e.g. in expert systems. Both topics are modeled via fuzzy\nsets and fuzzy logic, and these refer to suitable systems of MVL. Also,\nin databases and in knowledge-based systems one likes to store vague\ninformation.\n\n\nA second area of application is strongly tied with this first one: the\nautomatization of data and knowledge mining. Here clustering methods\ncome into consideration; these refer via unsharp clusters to fuzzy\nsets and MVL. In this context one is also interested in automated\ntheorem proving techniques for systems of MVL, as well as in methods\nof logic programming for systems of MVL. Part of this trend is the\nrecent development of generalized description logics, so-called fuzzy\ndescription logics, which allow the inclusion of technical tools\n(truth degrees, connectives, graded predicates) from the field of MVL\ninto \u2013 from the point of view of full first-order logics:\nrudimentary \u2013 systems of logic, so-called description logics, see\nStraccia (2001), H\u00e1jek (2005), Stoilos et al. (2008).\n4.6 Applications to Mathematics\n\n\nThere are three main topics inside mathematics which are related to\nmany-valued logic. The first one is the mathematical theory of fuzzy\nsets, and the mathematical analysis of \u201cfuzzy\u201d, or approximate\nreasoning. In both cases one refers to systems of MVL. The second topic\nhas been approaches toward consistency proofs for set theory using a\nsuitable system of MVL. And there is an \u2013 often only implicit \u2013\nreference to the basic ideas of MVL in independence proofs (e.g. for\nsystems of axioms) which often refer to logical matrices with more than\ntwo truth degrees. However, here MVL is more a purely technical tool\nbecause in these independence proofs one is not interested in an\nintuitive understanding of the truth degrees at all.\n5.  History of Many-Valued Logic\n Many-valued logic as a separate subject was created by the Polish\nlogician and philosopher \u0141ukasiewicz (1920), and developed first\nin Poland. His first intention was to use a third, additional truth\nvalue for \u201cpossible\u201d, and to model in this way the\nmodalities \u201cit is necessary that\u201d and \u201cit is\npossible that\u201d. This intended application to modal logic did not\nmaterialize. The outcome of these investigations are, however, the\n\u0141ukasiewicz systems, and a series of theoretical results\nconcerning these systems.\n\n\nEssentially parallel to the \u0141ukasiewicz approach, the American\nmathematician Post (1921) introduced the basic idea of additional truth\ndegrees, and applied it to problems of the representability of\nfunctions.\n\n\nLater on, G\u00f6del (1932) tried to understand intuitionistic logic\nin terms of many truth degrees. The outcome was the family of\nG\u00f6del systems, and a result, namely, that intuitionistic logic\ndoes not have a characteristic logical matrix with only finitely many\ntruth degrees. A few years later, Jaskowski (1936) constructed an\ninfinite valued characteristic matrix for intuitionistic logic. It\nseems, however, that the truth degrees of this matrix do not have a\nnice and simple intuitive interpretation.\n\n\nA philosophical application of 3-valued logic to the discussion of\nparadoxes was proposed by the Russian logician Bochvar (1938), and a\nmathematical one to partial function and relations by the American\nlogician Kleene (1938). Much later Kleene\u2019s connectives also became\nphilosophically interesting as a technical tool to determine fixed\npoints in the revision theory of truth initiated by Kripke (1975).\n\n\nThe 1950s saw (i) an analytical characterization of the class of\ntruth degree functions definable in the infinite valued propositional\n\u0141ukasiewicz system by McNaughton (1951), (ii) a completeness proof\nfor the same system by Chang (1958, 1959) introducing the notion of\nMV-algebra and a more traditional one by Rose/Rosser (1958), as well as\n(iii) a completeness proof for the infinite valued propositional\nG\u00f6del system by Dummett (1959). The 1950s also saw an approach of\nSkolem (1957) toward proving the consistency of set theory in the realm\nof infinite valued logic.\n\n\nIn the 1960s, Scarpellini (1962) made clear that the first-order\ninfinite valued \u0141ukasiewicz system is not (recursively)\naxiomatizable. Hay (1963) as well as Belluce/Chang (1963) proved that\nthe addition of one infinitary inference rule leads to an\naxiomatization of \\(\\rL_{\\infty}\\). And Horn (1969) presented a\ncompleteness proof for first-order infinite valued G\u00f6del logic.\nBesides these developments inside pure many-valued logic, Zadeh (1965)\nstarted an (application oriented) approach toward the formalization of\nvague notions by generalized set theoretic means, which soon was\nrelated by Goguen (1968/69) to philosophical applications, and which\nlater on inspired also a lot of theoretical considerations inside\nMVL.\n\n\nThe 1970s mark a period of restricted activity in pure many-valued\nlogic. There was, however, a lot of work in the closely related area of\n(computer science) applications of vague notions formalized as fuzzy\nsets, initiated e.g. by Zadeh (1975, 1979). And there was an important\nextension of MVL by a graded notion of inference and entailment in\nPavelka (1979).\n\n\nIn the 1980s, fuzzy sets and their applications remained a hot topic\nthat called for theoretical foundations by methods of many-valued\nlogic. In addition, there were the first complexity results e.g.\nconcerning the set of logically valid formulas in first-order infinite\nvalued \u0141ukasiewicz logic, by Ragaz (1983). Mundici (1986) started\na deeper study of MV-algebras.\n\n\nThese trends have continued since the 1980s. Research has included\napplications of MVL to fuzzy set theory and their applications,\ndetailed investigations of algebraic structures related to systems of\nMVL, the study of graded notions of entailment, and investigations into\ncomplexity issues for different problems in systems of MVL. This\nresearch was complemented by interesting work on proof theory, on\nautomated theorem proving, by different applications in artificial\nintelligence matters, and by a detailed study of infinite valued\nsystems based on t-norms \u2013 which now often are called\n(mathematical) fuzzy logics.\n",
