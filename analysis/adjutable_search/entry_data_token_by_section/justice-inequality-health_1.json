We begin in this section with a look at health\ninequalities among residents of the same state. We first examine the\nconcept of health equity which is often employed as a\nnormative standard in the public health literature for evaluating such\ninequalities. We then turn to the philosophical literature, providing\nan overview of the most prominent accounts of the justice of health\ninequalities. In the two remaining sections of this entry, we first\ndiscuss the relevance of individual responsibility for health justice\nbefore concluding with a discussion of the justice of global health\ninequalities.\n",
