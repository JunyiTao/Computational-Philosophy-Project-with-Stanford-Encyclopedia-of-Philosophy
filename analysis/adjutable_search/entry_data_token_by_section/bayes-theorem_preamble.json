    "main_text": "\n\n\nBayes' Theorem is a simple mathematical formula used for calculating\nconditional probabilities.  It figures prominently in\nsubjectivist or Bayesian approaches to epistemology,\nstatistics, and inductive logic. Subjectivists, who maintain that\nrational belief is governed by the laws of probability, lean heavily\non conditional probabilities in their theories of evidence and their\nmodels of empirical learning.  Bayes' Theorem is central to these\nenterprises both because it simplifies the calculation of conditional\nprobabilities and because it clarifies significant features of\nsubjectivist position.  Indeed, the Theorem's central insight \u2014\nthat a hypothesis is confirmed by any body of data that its truth\nrenders probable \u2014 is the cornerstone of all subjectivist\nmethodology.  \n",
