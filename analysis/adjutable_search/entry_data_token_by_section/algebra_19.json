    "main_text": "Algebraization of mathematics || Algebraic topology\n5.3 Algebraic topology\n\nAlgebraic topology analyzes the holes and obstructions in connected\ntopological spaces. A topologist is someone who imagines all objects\nto be made of unbreakable but very pliable playdough, and therefore\ndoes not see the need to distinguish between a coffee cup and doughnut\nbecause either can be turned into the other. Topology is concerned\nwith the similarities and differences between coffee cups with \\(n\\)\nhandles, surfaces with \\(n\\) holes, and more complicated shapes.\nAlgebraic topology expresses the invariants of such shapes in terms of\ntheir homotopy groups and homology groups.\n",
