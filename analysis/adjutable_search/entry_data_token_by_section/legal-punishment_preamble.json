    "main_text": "\n\nThe question of whether, and how, legal punishment can be justified\nhas long been a central concern of legal, moral, and political\nphilosophy: what could justify a state in using the apparatus of the\nlaw to inflict intentionally burdensome treatment on its citizens?\nRadically different answers to this question are offered by\nconsequentialist and by retributivist theorists \u2014 and by those\nwho seek to incorporate consequentialist and retributivist\nconsiderations in \u2018mixed\u2019 theories of punishment.\nMeanwhile, abolitionist theorists argue that we should aim to replace\nlegal punishment rather than to justify it. Among the significant\ndevelopments in recent work on punishment theory are the\ncharacterisation of punishment as a communicative enterprise, greater\nrecognition that punishment\u2019s justification depends on the\njustification of the criminal law more generally, growing interest in\nthe normative challenges raised by punishment in the international\ncontext, and increased concern for the relationship of punishment to\nthe so-called \u2018collateral\u2019 consequences of a\nconviction.\n",
