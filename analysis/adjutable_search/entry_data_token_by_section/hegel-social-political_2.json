    "main_text": "The Place of Hegel\u2019s Social and Political Thought || Metaphysical and Non-Metaphysical Readings\n1.2 Metaphysical and Non-Metaphysical Readings\n\nA second long-standing debate among Anglo-American commentators has\nconcerned the relation of Hegel\u2019s social and political thought to\nhis logic and wider philosophical system. For many decades, the\nnon-metaphysical reading has been the dominant approach. The central\nposition was summed up by Z. A. Pelczynski (1964: 136\u201337) who said:\n\u201cHegel\u2019s political thought can be read, understood, and\nappreciated without having to come to terms with his metaphysics\n\u2026 some intellectual curiosity may be unsatisfied when\nmetaphysics is left out; a solid volume of political theory and\npolitical thinking will still remain.\u201d The non-metaphysical\nreading follows a broadly analytic philosophical post-Kantian\ninterpretation which sees Hegel as accepting, and even extending,\nKant\u2019s critical philosophy (Neuhouser 2000, Pinkard 1994, Pippin\n2012). This work is notable for typical focusing attention on the\nPR grasping it philosophically separately from other parts of\nHegel\u2019s system which are sometimes deemed to be overly dark with\navoidable metaphysical commitments (Knowles 2002, Wood 1990).\n\nIn contrast, the metaphysical reading counters that\nanti-metaphysical interpretations take a one-sided approach to\nHegel\u2019s work (Beiser 2005, Rosen 1984, Taylor 1975). Hegel\nconceived his PR to be a part of a wider system. Isolating any\none text from its wider context may appear to inoculate any such\nreading from metaphysical claims elsewhere in Hegel\u2019s system.\nHowever, only a reading that grasps the full metaphysical foundations\nof his thought will do justice to his self-understanding (Houlgate\n2005).\n",
