Risk assessments have frequently been criticized for\ncontaining \u201chidden\u201d values that induce a too high\nacceptance of risk (Cranor 2016; 2017; Intemann 2016; Heinzerling\n2000). There is also a discussion on the need to strengthen the impact\nof certain values in risk assessment, such as considerations of\njustice (Shrader-Frechette 2005a), human rights (Shrader-Frechette\n2005b), and the rights and welfare of future people (Caney 2009; Ng\n2005). Issues of risk have also given rise to heated debates on what\nlevels of scientific evidence are needed for policy decisions. The\nproof standards of science are apt to cause difficulties whenever\nscience is applied to practical problems that require standards of\nproof or evidence different from those of science. \n\nA decision to accept or reject a scientific statement (for instance an\nhypothesis) is in practice always subject to the possibility of error.\nThe chance of such an error is often called the inductive risk (Hempel\n1965, 92). There are two major types of errors. The first of these\nconsists in concluding that there is a phenomenon or an effect when in\nfact there is none. This is called an error of type I (false\npositive). The second consists in missing an existing phenomenon or\neffect. This is called an error of type II (false negative). In the\ninternal dealings of science, errors of type I are in general regarded\nas more problematic than those of type II. The common scientific\nstandards of statistical significance substantially reduce the risk of\ntype I errors but do not protect against type II errors\n(Shrader-Frechette 2008; John 2017).\n\nMany controversies on risk assessment concern the balance between\nrisks of type I and type II errors. Whereas science gives higher\npriority to avoiding type I errors than to avoiding type II errors,\nthe balance can shift when errors have practical consequences. This\ncan be seen from a case in which it is uncertain whether there is a\nserious defect in an airplane engine. A type II error, i.e., acting as\nif there were no such a defect when there is one, would in this case\nbe counted as more serious than a type I error, i.e., acting as if\nthere were such a defect when there is none. (The distinction between\ntype I and type II errors depends on the delimitation of the effect\nunder study. In discussions of risk, this delimitation is mostly\nuncontroversial. Lemons et al. 1997; van den Belt and Gremmen\n2002.)\n\nIn this particular case it is fairly uncontroversial that avoidance of\ntype II error should be given priority over avoidance of type I error.\nIn other words, it is better to delay the flight and then find out\nthat the engine was in good shape than to fly with an engine that\nturns out to malfunction. However, in other cases the balance between\nthe two error types is more controversial. Controversies are common,\nfor instance, over what degree of evidence should be required for\nactions against possible negative effects of chemical substances on\nhuman health and the environment.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The use of scientific data for policy purposes.\n\n\nSuch controversies can be clarified with the help of a simple but\nillustrative model of how scientific data influence both scientific\njudgments and practical decisions (Hansson 2008). Scientific knowledge\nbegins with data that originate in experiments and other observations.\n(See Figure 1.) Through a process of critical assessment, these data\ngive rise to the scientific corpus (arrow 1). Roughly speaking, the\ncorpus consists of those statements that could, for the time being,\nlegitimately be made without reservation in a (sufficiently detailed)\ntextbook. When determining whether or not a scientific hypothesis\nshould be accepted, for the time being, as part of the corpus, the\nonus of proof falls on its adherents. Similarly, those who claim the\nexistence of an as yet unproven phenomenon have the burden of proof.\nThese proof standards are essential for the integrity of science. \n\nThe most obvious way to use scientific information for policy-making\nis to employ information from the corpus (arrow 2). For many purposes,\nthis is the only sensible thing to do. However, in risk management\ndecisions, exclusive reliance on the corpus may have unwanted\nconsequences. Suppose that toxicological investigations are performed\non a substance that has not previously been studied from a\ntoxicological point of view. These investigations turn out to be\ninconclusive. They give rise to science-based suspicions that the\nsubstance is dangerous to human health, but they do not amount to full\nscientific proof in the matter. Since the evidence is not sufficient\nto warrant an addition to the scientific corpus, this information\ncannot influence policies in the standard way (via arrows 1 and 2).\nThere is a strict requirement to avoid type I errors in the process\nrepresented by arrow 1, and this process filters out information that\nmight in this case have been practically relevant and justified\ncertain protective measures.\n\nIn cases like this, a direct road from data to policies is often taken\n(arrow 3). This means that a balance between type I and type II errors\nis determined in the particular case, based on practical\nconsiderations, rather than relying on the standard scientific\nprocedure with its strong emphasis on the avoidance of type I\nerrors.\n\nIt is essential to distinguish here between two kinds of risk-related\ndecision processes. One consists in determining which statements about\nrisks should be included in the scientific corpus. The other consists\nin determining how risk-related information should influence practical\nmeasures to protect health and the environment. It would be a strange\ncoincidence if the criteria of evidence in these two types of\ndecisions were always the same. Strong reasons can be given for strict\nstandards of proof in science, i.e. high entry requirements for the\ncorpus. At the same time, there can be valid policy reasons to allow\nrisk management decisions to be influenced by scientifically plausible\nindications of danger that are not yet sufficiently well-confirmed to\nqualify for inclusion into the scientific corpus. \n\nThe term inductive risk is usually reserved for the (type I\nand type II) risks that follow directly from the acceptance or\nrejection of an hypothesis. The term epistemic risk is used\nfor a wider category of risks in belief formation, such as risks taken\nwhen choosing a methodology, accepting a background assumption, or\ndeciding how to interpret data (Biddle 2016).\n\nPolicy issues concerning risk have often been the targets of extensive\ndisinformation campaigns characterized by science denial and other\nforms of pseudoscience (Oreskes 2010). Several philosophers have been\nactive in the repudiation of invalid claims and the defence of science\nin risk-related issues (Cranor 2005; 2016; 2017; Goodwin 2009;\nProthero 2013; Shrader-Frechette 2014; Hansson 2017).\n",
