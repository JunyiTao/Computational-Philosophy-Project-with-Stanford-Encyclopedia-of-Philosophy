    "main_text": "Category Differences || The Ryle/Husserl Method of Distinguishing Categories\n2.3 Fregean Approaches to Distinguishing Categories\n\nFrege treats distinctions in categories as correlates of distinctions\nin types of linguistic expression. The category of object,\nfor example, is distinguished by reference to the linguistic category\nof proper name (Dummett 1973 [1981], 55\u201356; cf. Wright\n1983, 13 and Hale 1987, 3\u20134) \u2013 i.e., an object just is the\ncorrelate of a proper name, where proper names are held to include all\nsingular terms (including singular substantival phrases preceded by\nthe definite article). Broadly Fregean approaches have been more\nrecently developed and defended by Michael Dummett (1973 [1981]) and\nBob Hale (2010).\n\nHale develops and defends the Fregean idea that \u201cthe division of\nnon-linguistic entities into different types or categories [is]\ndependent upon a prior categorization of the types of expressions by\nmeans of which we refer to them\u201d (2010, 403). As he develops the\nidea, to be an object is \u201cto be the referent of a\npossible singular term, to be a property is to be the\nreferent of a possible (first-level) predicate, and so on for\nother cases\u201d (2010, 411). He also argues that this encourages a\ndeflationary approach to existence questions according to which we may\nargue for the existence of entities of a certain kind by simply\narguing \u201cthat there are true statements involving expressions of\nthe relevant kind\u201d (2010, 406).\n\nDummett (1973 [1981]) also aims to develop and precisify a broadly\nFregean approach to category distinctions. Frege leaves the\ndistinction between so-called \u2018proper names\u2019 and other\nparts of speech merely intuitively understood, but Dummett argues\nthat, e.g., one could make a start at criteria for distinguishing\nproper names by requiring substitutability of terms while preserving\nthe well-formedness of a sentence (which, as we have seen in\n\u00a71.3, also plays a role in Husserl\u2019s distinction of meaning\ncategories), and while preserving the validity of various patterns of\ninference (where the latter requirement is needed to distinguish\nproper names from other substantival terms such as\n\u2018someone\u2019 and \u2018nobody\u2019) (1973 [1981], 58 ff.).\n(For further refinements of these criteria, see Dummett (1973 [1981],\n61\u201373) and Hale (1987, Chapter 2).)\n\nIn line with Frege\u2019s requirement (1884 [1968], \u00a762) that\nnames must be associated with a criterion of identity, Dummett argues\nthat an additional test (beyond these formal tests) is needed to\ndistinguish genuine proper names (to which objects correspond) from\nother sorts of expression: \u201cEven though an expression passes the\nmore formal tests we devised, it is not to be classified as a proper\nname, or thought of as standing for an object, unless we can speak of\na criterion of identity, determined by the sense of the expression,\nwhich applies to the object for which it stands\u201d (1973 [1981],\n79).\n\nThus once grammatical categories are distinguished, enabling us to\nthereby distinguish the logical category object by reference\nto the linguistic category of proper name, we can go on to\ndraw out category distinctions among objects. To avoid confusion,\nDummett calls the first range of distinctions (among logical\ncategories of objects, properties, relations, etc.) distinctions among\n\u2018types\u2019 and the second range of distinctions (within the\ntype object) distinctions among \u2018categories\u2019\n(1973 [1981], 76).\n\nSince, as Dummett argues (in a point further developed in Lowe 1989\nand Wiggins 2001), proper names and sortal terms must be associated\nwith a criterion of identity that determines the conditions under\nwhich the term may be correctly applied again to one and the same\nthing (1973 [1981], 73\u201375), we may use the associated criteria\nof identity in order to distinguish categories of objects referred to.\nAll of those names and general sortal terms (usable in forming complex\nnames) that share a criterion of identity are said to be terms of the\nsame category, even if the criteria of application for the\nassociated sortals vary (1973 [1981], 546). Thus, e.g., the sortal\nterms \u2018horse\u2019 and \u2018cow\u2019 (similarly, names of\nhorses and cows) are terms of the same category, since they share the\nidentity criteria suitable for animals.\n\nAs Lowe (1989, 108\u2013118) notes, this approach to categories\nblocks certain reductivist moves in metaphysics. For, e.g., if sortal\nterms such as \u2018person\u2019 and \u2018organism\u2019 are\nassociated with different identity conditions, then those who seek to\nreductively identify persons with biological organisms are involved in\na category mistake.\n\nThe idea that category distinctions among objects may be drawn out in\nterms of the identity and/or existence conditions associated with\nterms of each category has recently gained popularity. Though they\ndiffer in details, versions of the approach have been utilized not\nonly by Frege, Dummett and Hale but also by Lowe (2006, 6) and\nThomasson (2007).\n\nThis approach to drawing category distinctions among objects can avoid\nvarious potential problems and sources of skepticism. It is not\nsubject to problems like those Smart raised for Ryle\u2019s\ncriterion, for days of the week clearly have different identity\nconditions than do persons, whereas beds and chairs seem to share\nidentity conditions (those suitable for artifacts). Such a method of\ndrawing out categories also is not subject to the sorts of skepticism\nraised above for category systems. Here there is no claim to provide\nan exhaustive list of categories, and for a principled reason:\ndifferent categories may come into discussion as long as nominative\nterms or concepts associated with distinct identity conditions may be\ninvented.\n\nFollowing this method also guarantees that the categories\ndistinguished are mutually exclusive, for it is a corollary of this\nposition that entities may be identified only if they are governed by\nthe same identity conditions (and meet those), so that it is ruled out\na priori that one and the same entity could belong to two or\nmore distinct categories, in violation of the mutual exclusivity\nrequirement.\n\nThis method of distinguishing categories also provides a principled\nway of answering some of the central questions for theories of\ncategories, including whether or not there is a single summum\ngenus, and what the relationship is between linguistic/conceptual\nand ontological categories. Such completely general terms as\n\u201cthing\u201d \u201centity\u201d or \u201cobject\u201d, on\nDummett\u2019s view, are not genuine sortal terms, since they fail to\nprovide any criteria of identity. Thus clearly on this view (as on\nAristotle\u2019s) there is no summum genus under which\ncategories such as artifact, animal, etc. could be\narranged as species, since (lacking criteria of identity) such\ncandidate catch-all terms as \u2018object\u2019,\n\u2018being\u2019, \u2018entity\u2019 and the like are not even\nsortal terms and so cannot be categorial terms.\n\nViews that, like the Rylean and Fregean approaches, distinguish\ncategories by way of language, are sometimes criticized as capable\nonly of noting differences in category of certain linguistic\nexpressions. For why, it might be asked, should that have anything to\ntell us about differences in the categories of real\nthings?\n\nHale argues that there is no serious alternative to using types of\nexpression that aim at referring to entities of different types if we\nhope to characterize such basic logical categories (or types) as\nobject and property (2010, 408). For what it is to be an object or\nproperty evidently cannot be conveyed merely by ostension, nor by more\nsubstantive criteria, without being restrictive in ways that beg the\nquestion against various views of what objects or properties there\nare. Moreover, he argues that we can avoid making our (logical)\ncategories unduly dependent on what language we actually have by\ntreating objects and properties as correlates of possible,\nnot merely actual, expressions of the relevant sorts (2010, 411).\n\nDummett\u2019s way of understanding categories of objects also opens\nthe way for a reply to this objection. For Dummett argues that,\nwithout some associated categorial concept, we cannot single out\nobjects (even using names or demonstratives) (1973 [1981], 571).\nCategorial concepts are necessary for us to single out\n\u2018things\u2019 at all, and cannot be derived from considering\n\u2018things\u2019 preidentified without regard to categories. (It\nwould thus follow from this that Johansson\u2019s idea that we could\narrive at categories by abstraction from considering individual\nthings would be wrong-headed.) On this view, then, categories\nnot only may but must be distinguished primarily by\nway of distinguishing the identity conditions criterially associated\nwith the proper use of different sortal terms and names. If we cannot\nrefer to, discover, or single out objects at all except by way of a\ncertain categorial conception (providing application and identity\nconditions), then the categorial differences in our sortal terms or\nnames (marked by their differences in identity conditions) are\nipso facto, and automatically, category differences in the\nthings singled out by these terms \u2013 the possibility of a\n\u2018mistake\u2019 here just does not arise, and the connection\nbetween the category of an expression used to refer to a given entity\nand the category of the entity referred to is ensured.\n",
