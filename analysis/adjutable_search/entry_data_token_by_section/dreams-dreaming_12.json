    "main_text": "The ontology of dreams || The problem of dream belief\n2.8 The problem of dream belief\n\nThe second strand of the imagination view argues that dream beliefs\nare not real beliefs, but propositional imaginings. This may or may\nnot be combined with the claim that dream imagery is imaginative\nrather than perceptual (Sosa 2007; Ichikawa 2009).\n\nDenying that dream beliefs have the status of real beliefs only makes\nsense before the background of a specific account of what beliefs are\nand how they are distinguished from other mental states such as\ndelusions or propositional imaginings. For instance, Ichikawa (2009)\nargues that if we follow interpretationist or dispositionalist\naccounts of belief, dream beliefs fall short of real beliefs. He\nclaims dream beliefs lack connection with perceptual experience and\nfail to motivate actions; consequently, they do not have the same\nfunctional role as real beliefs. Moreover, we cannot ascribe dream\nbeliefs to a person by observing them lying asleep in bed. Dream\nbeliefs are often inconsistent with longstanding waking beliefs and\nacquired and discarded without any process of belief revision\n(Ichikawa 2009).\n\nThis analysis of dream beliefs has consequences for skepticism. If\ndream beliefs are propositional imaginings, then we do not falsely\nbelieve while dreaming that we are now awake, but only imagine that we\ndo (Sosa 2007). It is not clear though that this protects us from\ndeception. If dream beliefs fall short of real beliefs, this might\neven make the specter of dream deception more worrisome: in mistaking\ndream beliefs for the real thing, we would now be deceived about the\nstatus of our own mental states (Ichikawa 2008).\n\nIt is also not clear whether the same type of argument extends to\nmental states other than beliefs. As Lewis points out, a person\nmight\n\n\nin fact believe or realize in the course of a dream that he was\ndreaming, and even if we said that, in such case, he only dreamt that\nhe was dreaming, this still leaves it possible for someone who is\nasleep to entertain at the time the thought that he is asleep. (Lewis\n1969: 133) \n\n\nMental states other than believing such as entertaining, thinking, or\nminimally appraisive instances of taking for granted might be\nsufficient for deception (Reed 1979).\n\nThe debate about dream beliefs is paralleled by a debate about whether\ndelusions are beliefs or imaginings (see Currie 2000; Currie &\nRavenscroft 2002; McGinn 2004; Bayne & Pacherie 2005; Bortolotti\n2009; Gendler 2013). Both debates might plausibly inform each other,\nespecially as dreams are sometimes proposed to be delusional (Hobson\n1999).\n",
