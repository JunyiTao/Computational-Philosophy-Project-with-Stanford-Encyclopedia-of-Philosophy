    "main_text": "Some Broader Implications of Chaos || Free Will and Consciousness\n7.2 Free Will and Consciousness\n\nA number of authors have looked to quantum mechanics to help explain\nconsciousness and free will (e.g., Compton 1935; Eccles 1970; Penrose\n1991, 1994 and 1997; Beck and Eccles 1992; Stapp 1993; Kane 1996;\n quantum consciousness).\nStill it has been less clear to many that quantum mechanics is relevant\nto consciousness and free will. For example, an early objection to\nquantum effects influencing human volitions was offered by philosopher\nJ. J. C. Smart (1963, \n pp.\u00a0123\u20134).[15]\n Even if indeterminism was true at the quantum level, Smart argued\nthat the brain remains deterministic in its operations because quantum\nevents are insignificant by comparison. After all a single neuron is\nknown to be excited by on the order of a thousand molecules, each\nmolecule consisting of ten to twenty atoms. Quantum effects though\nsubstantial when focusing on single atoms are presumed negligible when\nfocusing on systems involving large numbers of molecules. So it looks\nlike quantum effects would be too insignificant in comparison to the\neffects of thousands of molecules to play any possible role in\nconsciousness or deliberation. \n\nArguments such as Smart\u2019s do not take into consideration the\npossibility for amplifying quantum effects through the interplay\nbetween SDIC at the level of the macroscopic world on the one hand\nand quantum effects on the other (see\n \u00a74).\n SD arguments purport to demonstrate that chaos in classical systems\ncan amplify quantum fluctuations due to sensitivity to the smallest\nchanges in initial conditions. Along these lines suppose (somewhat\nsimplistically) the patterns of neural firings in the brain correspond\nto decision states. The idea is that chaos could amplify quantum\nevents causing a single neuron to fire that would not have fired\notherwise. If the brain (a macroscopic object) is also in a chaotic\ndynamical state, making it sensitive to small disturbances, this\nadditional neural firing, small as it is, would then be further\namplified to the point where the brain states would evolve differently\nthan if the neuron had not fired. In turn these altered neural firings\nand brain states would carry forward such quantum effects affecting\nthe outcomes of human choices. \n\nThere are several objections to this line of argument. First, the\npresence of chaos in the brain and its operations is an empirical\nmatter that is hotly debated (Freeman and Skarda 1987; Freeman 1991,\n2000; Kaneko, Tsuda and Ikegami 1994 pp.\u00a0103\u2013189;\nVandervert 1997; Diesmann, Gewaltig and Aertsen 1999; Lehnertz 2000;\nVan Orden, Holden and Turvey 2003 and 2005; Aihara 2008; Rajan, Abbott\nand Sompolinsky 2010). It should be pointed out, however, that these\ndiscussions typically assume SD or Chaos\\(_{\\lambda}\\) as the\ndefinition of chaos. All that is really needed for sensitivity to and\namplification of quantum effects in the brain is the loss of principle\nof superposition found in nonlinear systems. Second, these kinds of\nsensitivity arguments depend crucially on how quantum mechanics itself\nand measurements are interpreted as well as the status of\nindeterminism (\u00a74). Third, although\nin the abstract sensitivity arguments seem to lead to the conclusion\nthat the smallest of effects can be amplified, applying such arguments\nto concrete physical systems shows that the amplification process may\nbe severely constrained. In the case of the brain, we\ncurrently do no know what constraints on amplification exist. \n\nAn alternative possibility avoiding many of the difficulties exhibited\nin the chaos+quantum mechanics approach is suggested by the research\non far-from-equilibrium systems by Ilya Prigogine and his\nBrussels-Austin Group (Bishop 2004). Their work purports to offer\nreasons to search for a different type of indeterminism in both micro\nand macrophysical domains.\n\n\nConsider a system of particles. If the particles are distributed\nuniformly in position in a region of space, the system is\nsaid to be in thermodynamic equilibrium (e.g., cream uniformly\ndistributed throughout a cup of coffee). In contrast, if the system is\nfar-from-equilibrium (nonequilibrium) the particles are arranged so\nthat highly ordered structures might appear (e.g., a cube of ice floating in\ntea). The following properties characterize nonequilibrium statistical\nsystems: large number of particles, high degree of structure and order,\ncollective behavior, irreversibility, and emergent properties. The\nbrain possesses all these properties, so that the brain can be\nconsidered a nonequilibrium system (an equilibrium brain is a dead\nbrain!).\n\n\nLet me quickly sketch a simplified version of the approach to point\nout why the developments of the Brussels-Austin Group offer an\nalternative for investigating the connections between physics,\nconsciousness and free will. Conventional approaches in physics\ndescribe systems using particle trajectories as a fundamental\nexplanatory element of their models, meaning that the behavior of a\nmodel is derivable from the trajectories of the particles composing the\nmodel. The equations governing the motion of these particles are\nreversible with respect to time (they can be run backwards and forwards\nlike a film). When there are too many particles involved to make these\ntypes of calculations feasible (as in gases or liquids), coarse-grained\naveraging procedures are used to develop a statistical picture of how\nthe system behaves rather than focusing on the behavior of individual\nparticles.\n\n\nIn contrast the Brussels-Austin approach views nonequilibrium\nsystems in terms of nonlinear models whose fundamental explanatory\nelements are distributions; that is to say, the arrangements of the\nparticles are the fundamental explanatory elements and not the\nindividual particles and\n trajectories.[16]\n The equations governing the behavior of these distributions are\ngenerally irreversible with respect to time. In addition focusing\nexclusively on distribution functions opens the possibility that\nmacroscopic nonequilibrium models are irreducibly indeterministic, an\nindeterminism that has nothing to do with ignorance about the\nsystem. If so, this would mean probabilities are as much an\nontologically fundamental element of the macroscopic world as they are\nof the microscopic and are free of the interpretive difficulties found\nin conventional quantum mechanics. \n\nOne important insight of the Brussels-Austin Group\u2019s shift away from\ntrajectories to distributions as fundamental elements is that\nexplanation also shifts from a local context (set of particle\ntrajectories) to a global context (distribution of the entire set of\nparticles). Systems acting as a whole may produce collective effects\nthat are not reducible to a summation of the trajectories and\nsubelements composing the system (Bishop 2004 and 2012). The brain\nexhibits this type of collective behavior in many circumstances (Engel,\net al. 1997) and the work of Prigogine and his colleagues\ngives us another tool for trying to understand that\nbehavior. Moreover, nonlinear nonequilibrium models also exhibit SDIC,\nso there are a number of possibilities in such approaches for very\nrich dynamical description of brain operations and cognitive phenomena\n(e.g., Juarrero 1999; Chemero and Silberstein 2008). Though the\nBrussels-Austin approach to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics is\nstill speculative and contains some open technical questions, it\n offers an alternative for exploring the relationship between\nphysics, consciousness and free will as well as pointing to a new\npossible source for indeterminism to be explored in free will\ntheories.\n\n\nWhether approaches applying chaotic dynamics to understanding the\nnature of consciousness and free will represent genuine advances\nremains an open question. For example, if the world is deterministic,\nthen the invocation of SDIC in cognitive dynamics (e.g., Kane 1996)\nmay provide a sophisticated framework for exploring deliberative\nprocesses, but would not be sufficient for incompatibilist\nnotions of freedom. On the other hand, if indeterminism (quantum\nmechanical or otherwise) is operative in the brain, the challenge\nstill remains for indeterminists such Robert Kane (1996) to\ndemonstrate that agents can effectively harness such indeterminism by\nutilizing the exquisite sensitivity provided by nonlinear dynamics to\nground and explain free will. Questions about realism and explanation\nin chaotic dynamics\n (\u00a75)\n are relevant here as well as the faithful model assumption. \n",
