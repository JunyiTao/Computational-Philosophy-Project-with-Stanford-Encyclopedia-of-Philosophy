    "main_text": "Encoding Dynamics in Typed Logic\n5. Conclusion\n\nHopefully, the above has given the reader a sense of Dynamic Semantics\nas a fruitful and flexible approach to meaning and information\nprocessing. Dynamic semantics comes with a set of flexible tools, and\nwith a collection of \u201ckiller applications\u201d, such as the\ncompositional treatment of donkey sentences, the account of anaphoric\nlinking, the account of presupposition projection, the account of\nepistemic updating and fine-grained distinctions between different\nkinds of (non-at-issue) updates. Dynamic semantics is a very lively\nsubfield of formal semantics and the cross-linguistic range of\nphenomena for which dynamic approaches are being pursued is expanding\nat an increasing pace.\n",
