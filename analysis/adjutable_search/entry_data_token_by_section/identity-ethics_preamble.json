    "main_text": "\n\n\nWhat justifies our holding one person over another morally responsible for a past\naction? Why am I justified in having a special prudential concern for\none particular future person over all others? Why do many of us think that \nmaximizing the good within a single life is perfectly acceptable, but\nmaximizing the good across lives is wrong? For these and other \nnormative questions, it looks like any answer we come up with will \nhave to make essential reference to personal identity. So, for \ninstance, it seems we are justified in holding X responsible\nfor some past action only if X is identical to the person \nwho performed that action. Further, it seems I am justified in my \nspecial concern for some future person only if he will be me. \nFinally, many of us think that while maximization within a life \naffects only one person, a metaphysical unity, maximization across \nlives affects many different, metaphysically distinct, persons, and \nso the latter is wrong insofar as it ignores this fundamental \nseparateness of persons.\n\n\nThese are among the many issues relevant to an investigation into the\nrelation between personal identity and ethics. \u201cEthics\u201d\nhere is broadly construed to be about the way(s) in which we ought to\nlive our lives, and so it includes both self-regarding and\nother-regarding practical concerns. Among the self-regarding concerns\nfor which personal identity seems relevant are those about the nature\nand grounds of survival and immortality, rational anticipation,\nadvance directives, and general prudential concern. Among the\nother-regarding concerns for which personal identity seems relevant\nare those about the nature and grounds of moral responsibility,\ncompensation, interpersonal moral relations, abortion and embryonic\nresearch, population ethics, and therapeutic treatments for\ndissociative identity disorders. A leading approach to exploring the\nrelation between identity and ethics, then, is to start with an\ninvestigation into the nature of personal identity and see how\nconclusions in that metaphysical realm might apply to these sorts of\npractical concerns. After starting with a brief discussion of notable\nhistorical accounts taking this approach, we will do so as well,\nsurveying the main theories of personal identity on offer and then\nseeing what, if anything, they might imply for several self-regarding\nand other-regarding ethical concerns. We will then turn to discuss\nseveral new approaches to discovering the relation between personal\nidentity and ethics, alternatives that have breathed fresh life into\nthe debate.\n",
