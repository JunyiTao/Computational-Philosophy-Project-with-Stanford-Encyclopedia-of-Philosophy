    "main_text": "Overview || Developmental Phenomena\n1.2 Developmental Phenomena\n\n\nDevelopmental biology is the science that seeks to explain how the\nstructure of organisms changes with time. Structure, which may also be\ncalled morphology or anatomy, encompasses the arrangement of parts,\nthe number of parts, and the different types of parts. (Slack 2006:\n6)\n\n\nMost of the properties that developmental biologists attempt to\nexplain are structural rather than functional. For example, a\ndevelopmental biologist concentrates more on how tissue layers fold or\nhow shape is generated than on what the folded tissue layers do or how\nthe shape functions. The ontogeny of function, at all levels of\norganization, is an element of developmental biology, but it is often\nbracketed because of the predominance (both past and present) of\nquestions surrounding the ontogeny of form or structure (Love\n2008).\n\nTextbooks (e.g., Gilbert 2010; Slack 2013; Wolpert et al. 2010)\ntypically describe a canonical set of events surrounding the changing\nstructures displayed during animal\n development.[1]\n The first of these is fertilization (in sexually reproducing\nspecies), where an already semi-organized egg merges with a sperm\ncell, followed by the fusion of their nuclei to achieve the\nappropriate complement of genetic material. Second, the fertilized egg\nundergoes several rounds of cleavage, which are mitotic\ndivisions without cell growth that subdivide the zygote into many\ndistinct cells\n (Figure 2).\n After many rounds of cleavage, this spherical conglomerate of cells\n(now called a blastula) begins to exhibit some specification\nof germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm) and then\nproceeds to invaginate at one end, a complex process referred to as\ngastrulation that eventually yields a through-gut. All three\ngerm layers, from which specific types of cells are derived (e.g.,\nneural cells from ectoderm), become established during gastrulation or\nshortly after it\n completes.[2]\nOrganogenesis refers to the production of tissues and organs\nthrough the interaction and rearrangement of cell groups. Events\nconfined to distinct taxonomic groups include neurulation in\nchordates, whereas other events correlate with mode of development\n(metamorphosis from a larval to adult stage) or individual\ntrauma (regeneration of a limb).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: An example of embryonic\ncleavage in marine snail embryos showing the fate of different cell\nlineages through developmental time.\n\n\nSeveral key processes underlie these distinct developmental events and\nthe resulting features of form that emerge (e.g., the through-gut\nformed subsequent to gastrulation or the heart formed during\norganogenesis). These are critical to the ontogeny of form and link\ndirectly to major research questions in developmental biology\n (Section 2).\n First, cellular properties, such as shape, change during ontogeny.\nThis is a function of differentiation whereby cells adopt\nspecific fates that include shape transformations\n (Figure 3).\n Second, regions of cells in the embryo are designated through\narrangement and composition alterations that correspond to different\naxes in different parts of the embryo (e.g., dorsal-ventral,\nanterior-posterior, left-right, and proximal-distal). The successive\nestablishment of these regions is referred to as pattern\nformation. Third, cells translocate and aggregate into layers\n(e.g., endoderm and ectoderm, followed by the mesoderm in many\nlineages) and later tissues (aggregations of differentiated cell\ntypes). Fourth, cells and tissues migrate and interact to produce new\narrangements and shapes composed of multiple tissue layers with novel\nfunctions (i.e., organs). These last two sets of processes are usually\ntermed morphogenesis (Davies 2005) and occur via many\ndistinct mechanisms\n (Section 1.3).\n Fifth, there is growth in the size of different form\nfeatures in the individual, remarkably obvious when comparing zygote\nto adult, although proportional change between different features\n(allometry) is also striking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A simple illustration of the\nkinds of differentiation related to the cellular components found in\nblood.\n\n\nNone of these processes occur in isolation and explanations of\nparticular form features usually draw on several of them\nsimultaneously, presuming other features that originated earlier in\nontogeny by different instantiations and combinations of the\nprocesses. This sets a broad agenda for investigation: how do various\niterations and combinations of these processes generate form features\nduring ontogeny? Consider the concrete example of vertebrate\ncardiogenesis. How does the vertebrate heart, with its internal and\nexternal shape and structure originate during ontogeny (Harvey 2002)?\nHow does the heart come to exhibit left/right asymmetry in the body\ncavity? What causes cells to adopt a muscle cell fate or certain\ntissues to interact in the prospective region of the heart? How do\nmuscle cells migrate to, aggregate in, and differentiate at the\ncorrect location? How does the interior of the heart adopt a\nparticular tubular structure with various chambers (that differs among\nvertebrate species)? How does the heart grow at a particular rate and\nachieve a specific size? Solutions relevant to explaining the ontogeny\nof form characterize causal factors that account for how different\nprocesses occur and yield various outcomes\n (Section 3).\n",
