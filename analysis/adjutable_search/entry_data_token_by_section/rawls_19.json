    "main_text": "Justice as Fairness: Justice within a Liberal Society || The Original Position\n4.6 The Original Position\n\nRawls\u2019s conceptions of citizens and society are still quite\nabstract, and some might think innocuous. The original\nposition aims to move from these abstract conceptions to\ndeterminate principles of social justice. It does so by translating\nthe question: \u201cWhat are fair terms of social cooperation for\nfree and equal citizens?\u201d into the question \u201cWhat terms of\ncooperation would free and equal citizens agree to under fair\nconditions?\u201d The move to agreement among citizens is what places\nRawls\u2019s justice as fairness within the social contract tradition\nof Locke, Rousseau, and Kant.\n\nThe strategy of the original position is to construct a method of\nreasoning that models abstract ideas about justice so as to focus\ntheir power together onto the choice of principles. So Rawls\u2019s\nconceptions of citizens and of society are built into the design of\nthe original position itself. Rawls\u2019s intent is that readers\nwill see the outcome of the original position as justified because\nthey will see how it embodies plausible understandings of citizens and\nsociety, and also because this outcome confirms many of their\nconsidered convictions about justice on specific issues.\n\nThe original position is a thought experiment: an imaginary situation\nin which each real citizen has a representative, and all of these\nrepresentatives come to an agreement on which principles of justice\nshould order the political institutions of the real citizens. This\nthought experiment is better than trying to get all real citizens\nactually to assemble in person to try to agree to principles of\njustice for their society. Even if that were possible, the bargaining\namong real citizens would be influenced by all sorts of factors\nirrelevant to justice, such as who could threaten the others most, or\nwho could hold out for longest.\n\nThe original position abstracts from all such irrelevant factors. The\noriginal position is a fair situation in which each citizen is\nrepresented as only a free and equal citizen: each representative\nwants only what free and equal citizens want, and each tries to agree\nto principles for the basic structure while situated fairly with\nrespect to the other representatives. The design of the original\nposition thus models the ideas of freedom, equality, and fairness. For\nexample, fairness and equality are modeled in the original position by\nthe symmetrical situation of the parties: no citizen\u2019s\nrepresentative is able to threaten any other citizen\u2019s\nrepresentative, or to hold out longer for a better deal.\n\nThe most striking feature of the original position is the veil of\nignorance, which prevents arbitrary facts about citizens from\ninfluencing the agreement among their representatives. As we have\nseen, Rawls holds that the fact that a citizen is of a certain race,\nclass, and gender is no reason for social institutions to favor or\ndisfavor her. Each representative in the original position is\ntherefore deprived of knowledge of the race, class, and gender of the\nreal citizen that they represent. In fact, the veil of ignorance\ndeprives the parties of all facts about citizens that are irrelevant\nto the choice of principles of justice: not only facts about their\nrace, class, and gender but also facts about their age, natural\nendowments, and more. Moreover the veil of ignorance also screens out\nspecific information about what society is like right now, so as to\nget a clearer view of the permanent features of a just social\nsystem.\n\nBehind the veil of ignorance, the informational situation of the\nparties that represent real citizens is as follows:\n\nParties do not know\n\n\nThe race, ethnicity, gender, age, income, wealth, natural\nendowments, comprehensive doctrine, etc. of any of the citizens in\nsociety, or to which generation in the history of the society these\ncitizens belong;\nThe political system of the society, its class structure, economic\nsystem, or level of economic development.\n \nParties do know\n\n\nThat citizens in the society have different comprehensive\ndoctrines and plans of life; that all citizens have interests in more\nprimary goods;\nThat the society is under conditions of moderate scarcity: there\nis enough to go around, but not enough for everyone to get what they\nwant;\nGeneral facts and common sense about human social life; general\nconclusions of science (including economics and psychology) that are\nuncontroversial.\n \n\n\nThe veil of ignorance situates the representatives of free and equal\ncitizens fairly with respect to one another. No party can press for\nagreement on principles that will arbitrarily favor the particular\ncitizen they represent, because no party knows the specific attributes\nof the citizen they represent. The situation of the parties thus\nembodies reasonable conditions, within which the parties can make a\nrational agreement. Each party tries to agree to principles that will\nbe best for the citizen they represent (i.e., that will maximize that\ncitizen\u2019s share of primary goods). Since the parties are fairly\nsituated, the agreement they reach will be fair to all actual\ncitizens.\n\nThe design of the original position also models other aspects of\nRawls\u2019s conceptions of citizens and society. For example, the\npublicity of a well-ordered society is modeled by the fact that the\nparties must choose among principles that can be publicly endorsed by\nall citizens. There are also some assumptions that make the\nhypothetical agreement determinate and decisive: the parties are not\nmotivated by envy (i.e., by how much citizens besides their own end up\nwith); the parties are neither risk-seeking nor risk-averse; and the\nparties must make a final agreement on principles for the basic\nstructure: there are no \u201cdo-overs\u201d after the veil of\nignorance is lifted and the parties learn which real citizen they\nrepresent.\n",
