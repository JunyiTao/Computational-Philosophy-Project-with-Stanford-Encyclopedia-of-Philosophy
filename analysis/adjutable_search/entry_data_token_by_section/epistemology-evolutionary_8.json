This is often\nnecessary, since the dynamics of such populations are often difficult\nto predict purely on the basis of static considerations of payoff\ndifferences. The so-called \u201creplicator dynamics\u201d were\nnamed by Taylor and Jonker (1978) and generalized by Schuster and\nSigmund (1983) and Hofbauer and Sigmund (1988). They trace their\nsource back to the seminal work of R.A. Fisher in the 1920s and 30s.\nThe generalization covers evolutionary models used in population\ngenetics, evolutionary game theory, ecology, and the study of\nprebiotic evolution. The models can be implemented either\nmathematically or computationally, and can model either stepwise\n(discrete) or continuous evolutionary change. \n\nPopulation dynamics models the evolution of populations. A population\nis a collection of individuals, which are categorized according to\ntype. The types in genetics are genes, in evolutionary game theory,\nstrategies. The types of interest in epistemological models would be\ntypes of cognitive apparatuses, or cognitive strategies \u2014 ways\nof responding to environmental cues, ways of manipulating\nrepresentations, and so forth. Roughly, EEM models focus on the\ninherited and EET models focus on the learned. The evolution of the\npopulation consists in changes of the relative frequency of the\ndifferent types within the population. Selection, typified by\ndifferential reproductive success, is represented as follows. Each\ntype has a growth rate or \u201cfitness\u201d, designated by \\(w\\),\nand a frequency designated by \\(p\\). The frequency of type \\(i\\) at\nthe next generation \\(p'_i\\) is simply the old frequency multiplied by\nthe fitness and divided by the mean fitness of the population\n\u201c\\(\\overline{w}\\)\u201d. \n\\[p'_i = p_i \\cdot w_i \\frasl \\overline{w}\n\\]\n\n\nDivision by \\(\\overline{w}\\) has the effect of\n\u201cnormalizing\u201d the frequencies, so that they add up to one\nafter each is multiplied by its fitness. It also makes evident that\nthe frequency of a type will increase just in case its fitness is\nhigher than the current population average. \nFitness\n\nFitnesses, which should be understood simply as the aggregation of\nprobable-growth factors that drive the dynamics of large populations,\nmay depend on a variety of factors. Fitness components differ from\nvariation components in that they affect population frequencies\nproportionally to those frequencies, that is to say, multiplicatively.\nFitness components in biological evolution include mortality and\nreproductive rate. In cultural evolution, they include transmission\nprobability and rejection probability. Within either sort of model,\nwhat matters is how fitnesses change as a result of other changing\nfactors within the model. In the simplest cases, fitnesses are fixed\nand the type with the highest fitness inevitably dominates the\npopulation. In more complex cases, fitnesses may depend on variable\nfactors like who one plays against, or the state of a variable\nenvironment. Most commonly, variable fitnesses are calculated using a\npayoff matrix like the one above. In general, to calculate the\nexpected fitness of a type, one multiplies the fitness a type would\nhave in each situation times the likelihood that individuals in the\npopulation will confront that situation and adds the resulting\nproducts.  \n\\[\nw_i = S_A \\Pr(A)\\cdot W_{iA}\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(W_{iA}\\) is type \\(i\\)\u2019s fitness in situation \\(A\\).\nThis sort of calculation assumes that the effects of the various\nsituations are additive. More complex situations can be modeled, of\ncourse, but additive matrices are the standard. It should be noted,\nhowever, that matrix-driven evolution can exhibit quite complex\nbehavior. For instance, chaotic behavior is possible with as few as\nfour strategies (Skyrms 1992).\n\nSome relationships may be represented without a matrix. Boyd and\nRicherson (1985), for instance, were interested in a special kind of\nfrequency dependent transmission bias in culture, where being common\nconferred an advantage due to imitators \u201cdoing as the Romans\ndo.\u201d In such a case, the operative fitness of the type is just\nthe fitness as calculated according to the usual factors, and then\nmodified as a function of the frequency of the type.\nContinuity and Computation\n\nThe conceptual bases of replicator dynamics are quite straightforward.\nGetting results typically requires one of two approaches. In order to\nprove more than rudimentary mathematical results, one typically needs\nto derive a continuous version of the dynamics. The basic form is \n\n\\[\ndp_i /dt = p(w_i - \\overline{w})\n\\]\n\n\nwith fitnesses calculated as usual. Mathematical approaches have been\nquite productive, though the bulk of theoretical results apply\nprimarily to population genetics. See Hofbauer and Sigmund (1988) for\na compendium of such results, as well as a reasonable graduate-level\nintroduction to the mathematical study of evolutionary processes. \n\nThe second approach is computational. With the increase in power of\npersonal computers, computational implementation of evolutionary\nmodels become increasingly attractive. They require only rudimentary\nprogramming skills, and are in general much more flexible in the\nassumptions they require. The general strategy is to create an array\nto hold population frequencies and fitnesses, and then a series of\nprocedures (or methods or functions) which\n\ncalculate fitnesses,\nupdate frequencies with the new fitnesses, and\nmanage interface details like outputting the new state of the\npopulation to a file or the screen.\n\n\nA loop then runs the routines in sequence, over and over again. Most\nmodelers are happy to put their source code on the internet, which is\nprobably the best place to find it. \nModeling Cultural Evolution\n\nPart of the difficulty in understanding cognitive behavior as the\nproduct of evolution is that there are at least three very different\nevolutionary processes involved. First, there is the biological\nevolution of cognitive and perceptual mechanisms via genetic\ninheritance. Second, there is the cultural evolution of languages and\nconcepts. Third, there is the trial-and-error learning process that\noccurs during an individual\u2019s lifetime. Moreover, there is some\nreason to agree with Donald T. Campbell that understanding human\nknowledge fully will require understanding the interaction between\nthese processes. This requires that we be able to model both processes\nof biological and cultural evolution. There are by now a number of\nwell-established models of biological evolution. Cultural evolution\npresents more novelty. \n\nPerhaps the most popular attempt to understand cultural evolution is\nRichard Dawkins\u2019 (1976) invention of the \u201cmeme.\u201d\nDawkins observed that what lies at the heart of biological evolution\nis differential reproduction. Evolution in general was then the\ncompetitive dynamics of lineages of self-replicating entities. If\nculture was to evolve, on this view, there had to be cultural\n\u201creplicators\u201d, or entities whose differential replication\nin culture constituted the cultural evolutionary process. Dawkins\ndubbed these entities \u201cmemes\u201d, and they were characterized\nas informational entities which infect our brains, \u201cleaping from\nhead to head\u201d via what we ordinarily call imitation. Common\nexamples include infectious tunes, and religious ideologies. The main\ndifficulty with this approach has been the problem of how to provide\nspecifications for the basic entities. The identity conditions of\ngenes can be given, in theory, in terms of sequences of base pairs in\nchromosomes. There appears to be no such fundamental\n\u201calphabet\u201d for the items of cultural transmission.\nConsequently, the project of \u201cmemetics\u201d as a contending\nbasis for evolutionary epistemology is on hold pending an adequate\nunderstanding of its basic ontology. The online\n Journal of Memetics\n contains some early papers on memetics. Although the journal has\nceased publication, the existing papers are still accessible online.\nSee Atran (2001) and Sperber (2001) for reservations about the\nviability of memetic models of cultural evolution. For a recent\ndefense of this approach, see Dennett (2017).\n\nPopulation models have been used to good effect in modeling cultural\ntransmission processes. Evolutionary game theory models are frequently\nclaimed to cover both processes in which strategies are inherited and\nthose in which they are imitated. This application is possible in the\nabsence of any specification of the underlying nature of strategies,\nfor instance, whether they are to be thought of as\n\u201cthings\u201d which are replicated, or whether they are\nproperties or states of the individuals whose strategies they are.\nThis is sometimes referred to as the \u201cepidemiological\napproach\u201d, though again, the comparison to infection is due to\nthe quantitative tools used in analysis rather than to any\npresupposition regarding the underlying ontology of cultural\ntransmission (Sperber 1996, Sperber and Hirschfield 2004).\n\nSome recent work focuses on the capacities of organisms to modify\ntheir environments in ways that affect the selection pressures that\nthey face. In classical models of organism-environment interactions,\norganisms adapted to their environments by \u201cfiting\u201d into\npre-existing niches. Richard Lewontin\u2019s dialectical model of\norganism-environment interactions emphasized the extent to which\norganisms \u201cconstruct\u201d niches rather than merely\naccommodating themselves to those already present in the environment\n(Lewontin 1982). There is now a large body of literature on niche\nconstruction (see inter alia Laland et al. 2000 and\nOdling-Smee et al. 2003) The application of this idea to issues in\nevolutionary epistemology takes the form of appeals to cultural niches\nand cognitive niches. Cultural niches are created by the capacity of\norganisms, in general, to the extent that having culture can be\nattributed to them, and human beings, in particular, to learn from one\nanother and from the constructed cultural modifications of their\nenvironments. For human beings, such constructions take the forms of,\namong others, language, educational institutions, communication\nsystems and other forms of information manipulation and transfer.\nCognitive niches are created by the capacities for constructing mental\nmodels of the environment that, in turn, enable organisms, especially\nhuman beings, during the course of their lifetimes to systematically\nand efficiently exploit the resources of their environments (Pinker\n2003, 2010; Whiten and Erdal 2012, Whiten and van Schaik 2007, Laland\nand O\u2019Brien 2011)\n",
