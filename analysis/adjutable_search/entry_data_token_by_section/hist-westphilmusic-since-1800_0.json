    "main_text": "Nineteenth Century || Romantic Musical Aesthetics\n1.1 Romantic Musical Aesthetics\n\nAt the end of the eighteenth century, a new aesthetic sensibility\nemerges in Europe. The imitation of nature loses ground to new values\nsuch as the expression of feelings and the autonomy of art. No longer\nconfined to the imitation of the sensible world, art is conceived as a\nway to attain knowledge of a transcendent reality. This shift in\nattitude is of paramount importance for the position of music among\nthe arts. If the eighteenth century had struggled to fit the growing\ninstrumental repertoire into the clothes of imitation, the Romantics\nproclaimed music\u2019s superiority precisely in virtue of its\nabsolute nature. And while the early modern period had occasionally\ntouted the pleasures of listening, the Romantics raised the bar,\nstressing that music\u2019s value is not primarily hedonic, but\nrather cognitive.\n\nThe rise of this new musical aesthetics is particularly evident in the\nworks of Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder (1773\u20131798). His\nFantasies on Art for Friends of Art [Phantasien \u00fcber\ndie Kunst f\u00fcr Freunde der Kunst] (1799), while unsystematic\nand lacking argumentation, is rich in suggestions. For instance, we\nfind in it a tell-tale comparison between music and the visual arts.\nThe latter can at best aim at a convincing imitation of natural\nobjects, though their productions hardly compare to the beauty of\nnature. Not so with music, as natural sounds have little value when\ncompared to musical tones, since these\n\n\nare of an entirely different nature; they don\u2019t imitate, they\ndon\u2019t beautify, but rather represent a separate world in itself.\n(Wackenroder 1799: 241, my translation)\n\n\nIf music does not deal with the world as we know it from ordinary\nperception, but rather with a transcendent reality, then language will\nfail to describe music effectively. This is what we could call the\nineffability thesis, which emerges in various forms in the\nwritings of Romantic philosophers, critics, and musicians. The view is\nconveyed not so much by the weak claim that we do not currently have\nwords to name what music means or expresses, but rather by the\nstronger claim that we could not possibly find them. While it is\nperhaps Arthur Schopenhauer who is responsible for the most\ninfluential philosophical account of ineffability (see following\nsection), the composer Felix Mendelssohn (1809\u20131847) gives the\nineffability thesis its most famous formulation when he states\nthat\n\n\n[t]he thoughts which are expressed to me by a piece of music which I\nlove are not too indefinite to be put into words, but on the contrary\ntoo definite. (letter to Marc-Andr\u00e9 Souchay 15 October 1842,\nquoted in Fubini 1991: 307)\n\n\nThe composer and historian of music August Wilhelm Ambros\n(1816\u20131876), further away from the heyday of the Romantic\nmovement, makes a somewhat weaker claim:\n\n\nPoetry, much like music, is able to express feelings, for which it\nwould be almost impossible to find a corresponding term. (Ambros 1885:\n70, my translation)\n\n\nThe ineffability thesis was put into question around the middle of the\ncentury by the growing support for formalist tendencies, which saw in\nour inability to name the feelings expressed by music a symptom of its\nexpressive poverty (see\n \u00a71.6).\n\nPrecisely because of its strikingly Romantic tinge, it is tempting to\nbrush off the ineffability thesis as a historical curiosity. However,\nit is worth noting that the rejection of language as a model for the\nunderstanding of music is a move that allows us to look at music as a\nsymbol in its own right, with its own syntactic and semantic rules.\nFubini writes:\n\n\nInstrumental music had always been charged with indeterminacy; yet it\nis only indeterminate when it is viewed from the standpoint of verbal\nlanguage. Herein lies the great discovery of the Romantic thinkers,\nthat the idiom of music is of a quite different order, and is to be\nmeasured with an entirely different yardstick. (Fubini 1991: 266)\n\n\nFar from being confined to a Romantic curiosity, the difference\nbetween language and music qua symbol systems will be\nexplored in the twentieth century by proponents of semiotic approaches\nsuch as Susanne Langer and Nelson Goodman (see\n \u00a72.3).\n\nWackenroder also voices another typically Romantic view, according to\nwhich the emotions expressed by an artwork bear a relation to the ones\nfelt by the artist as she composed the work. In Wackenroder\u2019s\nOutpourings of an Art-Loving Monk [Herzensergiessungen\neines kunstliebenden Klosterbruders] (1797), the fictional Joseph\nBerglinger\n\n\nfilled his soul with the most sublime poetry, with a full and exultant\nhymn, and, in a marvelous inspiration, but still violently shaken\nemotionally, he set down a passion music which, with its deeply\naffecting melodies, embodying all the pains of suffering, will forever\nremain a masterpiece. (Wackenroder 1797 [1950: 762])\n\n\nIn its strongest formulation, this view holds that a work of music\nbeing sad, happy, and the like, requires the author to have been in\nthat emotional state when composing the work. This is known today as\nexpression theory (for a classic exposition, see Abrams 1971:\nchapter 4), and is sometimes paired with the further claim that, upon\nappreciating the work, one will be put in an emotional state similar\nto the artist\u2019s. Although it is now largely discredited (Tormey\n1971; Budd 1985: chapter 7), the expression theory is a paradigmatic\nview of artistic production as (emotional) communication between two\nindividuals. Wackenroder, again through the character of Berglinger,\nis comforted by the thought that\n\n\nthere may be someone whom Heaven has made so sympathetic to my soul\nthat he will feel on hearing my melodies precisely what I felt in\nwriting them\u2014precisely what I sought to put in them.\n(Wackenroder 1797 [1950: 759])\n\n\nLudwig van Beethoven (1770\u20131827), is arguably the most important\ncomposer who described his compositional practice in ways that are\nsuggestive of the expression theory:\n\n\n[\u2026] like the poet who is inspired by the feelings that he\ntransmutes into words, I too am inspired to turn my feelings into the\nmusic that sounds within me and torments me until finally it has been\nput down in notes on the sheet of paper in front of me. (Beethoven\n1961, quoted in Fubini 1991: 288)\n\n\nWackenroder\u2019s writings already show evidence of the change in\nattitude toward instrumental music. Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann\n(1776\u20131822), a writer, composer, and critic, is a crucial figure\nin this process. The start of his essay Beethoven\u2019s\nInstrumental Music (1813) is a quintessential expression of the\nRomantic conception of music:\n\n\nWhen we speak of music as an independent art, should we not always\nrestrict our meaning to instrumental music, which, scorning every aid,\nevery admixture of another art (the art of poetry), gives pure\nexpression to music\u2019s specific nature, recognizable in this form\nalone? It is the most romantic of all the arts\u2014one might almost\nsay, the only genuinely romantic one\u2014for its sole subject is the\ninfinite. (Hoffman 1813 [1950: 775])\n\n\nThe glorification of instrumental music is paired with the\ncondemnation of imitation. Extra-musical imagery, however, is not\naltogether banned, at least on the listener\u2019s side: much like\nWackenroder, Hoffmann helps himself to fanciful descriptions of music,\nand uses these in order to bring out the differences among the three\ngreatest representatives of the Viennese School. Thus, Haydn\n\u201cleads us into vast green woodlands\u201d (Hoffman 1813 [1950\n[776]), Mozart \u201cleads us into the heart of the spirit\nrealm\u201d (1813 [1950: 777]), whereas Beethoven\u2019s\ninstrumental music \u201copens up to us also the realm of the\nmonstrous and the immeasurable\u201d (1813 [1950: 777]).\nHoffman\u2019s essay also contains a version of the ineffability\nthesis:\n\n\nmusic discloses to man an unknown realm, a world that has nothing in\ncommon with the external sensual words that surrounds him, a world in\nwhich he leaves behind him all definite feelings to surrender himself\nto an inexpressible longing. (Hoffman 1813 [1950: 775\u2013776])\n\n\nWhile many of these claims are advanced by early Romantics without\nmuch argumentative support, at least some of these views are given a\nmore systematic defense by Schopenhauer.\n",
