    "main_text": "Unactualized Possibles\n4. Unactualized Possibles\n\nDescartes is unambiguous that there are some things that we clearly\nand distinctly perceive to be possible. To Mersenne he speaks of\nbeings whose existence we clearly perceive to be possible (\u201cTo\nMersenne, March 1642,\u201d AT 3:544\u201345, CSMK 211); he also\nsays that God \u201ccan bring about everything that I clearly and\ndistinctly recognize as possible\u201d (Fourth Replies, AT\n7:219, CSM 2:154). In First Replies he says that\n\n\u2026we must distinguish between possible and necessary existence.\nIt must be noted that possible existence is contained in the concept\nor idea of everything that we clearly and distinctly understand; but\nin no case is necessary existence so contained except in the case of\nthe idea of\n God.[23]\n\n\nIn addition, he says to Mesland that \u201cour mind is finite and so\ncreated as to be able to perceive as possible things which God has\nwished to be in fact\n possible.\u201d[24]\n The interpretive issue here is what Descartes is talking about when\nhe speaks in such terms. One interpretation that immediately suggests\nitself is that Descartes holds that there are things or states of\naffairs that, though not actual, are counterfactually\n possible.[25]\n A number of considerations speak in favor of such a reading. One is\nthat Descartes\u2019 view that mind and body are really distinct\nappears to be the view that minds and bodies that are in fact united\ncan exist\n apart.[26]\n Another is that Descartes says that we have clear and distinct\nperceptions of possible existence and of what is possible, thus making\nit appear that he holds that God\u2019s creatures include not only\nactuals but also unactualized\n possibles.[27]\n Finally, a possibilist reading fits Descartes within a long tradition\nof figures like Scotus and Bradwardine who posit possible being to\nsecure the meaning and reference of claims about things that could be\nbut aren\u2019t (Normore 1991, 69\u201371; Normore 1986, 224,\n231\u201334). If Descartes wants to make claims about unactualized\npossibles and if he does not want those claims to be non-sensical,\nunactualized possibles need to have some kind of ontological status in\nhis system.\n\nDescartes may in fact be committed to attributing reality to\nunactualized possibles, but a few interpretive problems arise if he\ndoes. One is that as we have seen he says elsewhere that unactualized\nbeing is nothing. In the Third Meditation, he argues that the\nobjective reality of the idea of God cannot have been caused by\npotential perfections towards which a finite being might be evolving\nbecause potentialities are nothing and so have no causal power. He\nsays,\n\n\u2026 I perceive that the objective being of an idea cannot be\nproduced merely by potential being, which strictly speaking is\nnothing, but only by actual or formal being. (AT 7:47, CSM 2:32)\n\n\nIf Descartes holds that potential being is nothing, then it is\ndifficult to see how he can include unactualized possibles in his\nontology.\n\nAnother interpretive problem is that it is difficult to see exactly\nwhere possible reality would fit into Descartes\u2019 ontology. For\nDescartes, all reality depends for its existence on God \u2013 even\npossible reality (\u201cTo [Mesland], 2 May 1644,\u201d AT\n4:118\u20139, CSMK 235). A possible being is thus a creature with an\nontological status. Descartes holds that truth is the conformity of\nthought with its object, that \u201c[t]ruth consists in being\u201d\n(\u201cTo Clerselier, 23 April 1649,\u201d AT 5:356, CSMK 377), and\nthat true ideas are \u201cideas of real things\u201d (The Third\nMeditation, AT 7:43, CSM 2:30). Clear and distinct perceptions of\npossibilities conform to reality and are of real things; they have a\ntruth-maker. A clearly and distinctly perceived possibility has some\nontological status, and the question is what exactly that is. This is\na question on which the Descartes literature has been largely silent,\nbut the options would appear to be that possibilities are either\ncreatures or ideas in the mind of God.\n\nIf possible beings are creatures, there is some difficulty in making\nroom for them in Descartes\u2019 ontology. Descartes is fairly clear\nthat the only creatures that exist are finite minds and bodies and\ntheir modes:\n\nI recognize only two ultimate classes of things: first, intellectual\nof thinking things, i.e. those which pertain to mind or thinking\nsubstance; and secondly, material things, i.e. those which pertain to\nextended substance or body. Perception, volition and all the modes\nboth of perceiving and willing are referred to thinking substance;\nwhile to extended substance belong size (that is, extension in length,\nbreadth and depth), shape, motion, position, divisibility of component\nparts and the\n like.[28]\n\n\nOne category of being in Descartes\u2019 ontology is thinking\nsubstance (and its modes), and another is extended substance (and its\nmodes). If Descartes\u2019 possibles are just created thinking or\nextended substances, then presumably they are actuals and not\npossibles.\n\nOf course, one might suggest that Descartes\u2019 dualism entails\nthat there are two kinds of things \u2013 thinking things and\nmaterial things \u2013 but that in each of these classes there are\nsubstances with actual existence and also substances with possible\nexistence. On such a view, the class of thinking substances (for\nexample) includes thinking substances with actual existence and\nthinking substances with possible existence.\n\nThere are a couple of problems with this view, however. One is that\nDescartes holds that it follows from God\u2019s essence that God is\neternal and that His will is wholly immutable (The Third Meditation,\nAT 7:45, CSM 2:31; Principles I.56, AT 8A:26, CSM 1:211;\n\u201cTo Mersenne, 15 April 1630,\u201d AT 1:145\u20136, CSMK 23;\nPrinciples II:36, AT 8A:61, CSM 1:24). If it is a necessary\ntruth that God is eternal and that His will is immutable, and if God\ncontains absolutely no potentiality, then there does not exist the\npossibility that God\u2019s eternal will could have been other than\nit is. So that possibility does not exist; and neither does it appear\nthat there exist any possible creatures. Descartes holds that there is\na single series that God preordains and that is (as would be expected)\nimmutable (Principles I.40\u201341, AT 8A:20, CSM 1:206). If\nGod created things that were merely possible, it is unclear how He\nwould be able to actualize them instead of the things that are\nactualized in the series, if none of the requisite possibilities\nexist, and so it is unclear how they would constitute\npossibilities. These alleged possibilities (if they are\nanything) would be among all of the other creatures; they would be\nactuals.\n\nIt might of course be the case that Descartes just insists that there\nare possible existents in addition to actual existents. Alternately,\nit might be the case that like Spinoza (in Ethics Part IV,\ndefinitions three and four), Descartes uses the expression\n\u201cpossible existence\u201d to describe actually-existing\ncreatures, and in a way that is consistent with a denial of non-actual\nreality. For example, in some places Descartes identifies things as\nhaving possible existence to highlight that they are dependent\ncreatures, and creatures whose existence cannot be read straight from\ntheir concept. To describe the kind of existence had by finite\ncreatures generally, he uses \u2018possible existence\u2019 and\n\u2018contingent existence\u2019 interchangeably: he sometimes\nspeaks of the beings that depend on God for their existence as having\n\u201cpossible or contingent existence\u201d (Second\nReplies, AT 7:166, CSM 2:117; Notae, AT 8B:361, CSM\n1:306), and sometimes he speaks of them as having just\n\u201ccontingent existence\u201d (Principles I.15, AT\n8A:10, CSM 1:198). When he says that creatures have possible\nor contingent existence, he identifies the two kinds of\nexistence: \u201cpossible or [sive] contingent\nexistence\u201d (AT 7:166). If contingent existence is just the kind\nof existence had by beings that depend for their existence on\nGod\u2019s will and whose existence cannot be established by an\nanalysis of their concept alone (Fifth Meditation, AT 7:63\u201366,\nCSM 2:44\u201346; Rules for the Direction of the Mind, AT\n10:421\u201322, CSM 1:45\u201346), then the fact that a thing has\npossible existence in Descartes\u2019 ontology does not suggest that\nthe thing does not actually exist. Such a thing exists, but in a way\nthat has it wholly dependent on God. Descartes also suggests this\ndefinition of \u201cpossible existence\u201d when he contrasts\nnecessary existence with the kind of existence had by creatures in\nFirst Replies: unlike necessary existence, the existence had\nby a creature is marked by the fact that it \u201chas no power to\ncreate itself or maintain itself in existence\u201d (AT 7:118, CSM\n2:84). It might be that like some of his predecessors Descartes is\nusing \u2018possible existence\u2019 to describe a kind of being had\nby actually existing\n things.[29]\n\nIf possibilities are not creatures that exist in addition to thinking\nsubstances and extended substances, another interpretive option is to\nsay that they are ideas in the mind of God, but that God does not\nactualize. This interpretive option is precluded by Descartes\u2019\ncommitment to the identity of God\u2019s will, intellect, and\ncreative activity:\n\n\u2026in God, willing, understanding, and creating are all the same\nthing without one being prior to the other even conceptually.\n(\u201cTo Mersenne, 27 May 1630,\u201d AT 1:152, CSMK 25\u201326)\n\n\nIn God willing and knowing are a single thing in such a way that by\nthe very fact of willing something he knows it and it is only for this\nreason that such a thing is true. (\u201cTo Mersenne, 6 May\n1630,\u201d AT 1:149, CSMK 24)\n\n\nA philosopher like Leibniz will insist on a distinction between\nGod\u2019s understanding and will so as to secure the existence of\nthings in God\u2019s understanding that God does not actually create.\nA philosopher like Spinoza will point out that a thinker who is\ncommitted to the identity of God\u2019s will and intellect is\ncommitted to the view that there is nothing that God understands that\nGod does not create. Spinoza will add that such a thinker is not\nrestricting God\u2019s omnipotence if God is the cause of all being\nand if alleged unactualized possibilities are outside the scope of\nGod\u2019s intellect and will. Descartes appears to be siding with\nSpinoza here: what is not the object of God\u2019s\nunderstanding is nothing at all, and what is the object of God\u2019s\nunderstanding is created and made\n actual.[30]\n If Descartes is seriously committed to the identity of God\u2019s\nintellect and will, it is difficult to see how he can also be\ncommitted to the existence of unactualized possibles.\n\nThere are a number of passages in which Descartes speaks of what is\npossible. To fix an interpretation of these passages, we can look to a\nnumber of different places. One is common-sense. We might argue that\nany view is crazy that does not admit that there are things that could\nhappen or exist but that do not. Since Descartes is not crazy, what he\nmust mean when he speaks of the possible is unactualized being. Or, we\nmight argue that Descartes is continuing in the tradition of thinkers\nwho clearly do posit unactualized possibles. If these figures\ninclude unactualized being within their ontologies, and if Descartes\nis building on their work, then his claims about the possible are\nabout unactualized being. Or, we might attempt to isolate parts of\nDescartes\u2019 system that have a bearing on what\n\u201cpossible\u201d might mean in his system. Parts of this system\nentail that \u2018possible existence\u2019 is just the actual\nexistence of dependent beings. If by \u201cpossible existence\u201d\nDescartes just means the dependent existence of actually existing\ncreatures, then passages in which Descartes speaks of a thing as being\npossible or having possible existence are not evidence that Descartes\nholds that there are things that could be but are not. Of course, it\nmight just be the case that Descartes has reason to help himself to\nentities that the rest of his system shuts out.\n\nIf Descartes does hold that there are things that could be but are\nnot, his view still demands the important qualification discussed in\nthe first section above. He of course realizes that in everyday\ndiscourse we speak of things that can happen but don\u2019t. However,\nif our understanding of these things is not clear and distinct, and if\nour understanding of them as possible is not clear and distinct, then\nDescartes will not introduce them as possibilities. Descartes\nappreciates that according to common ways of speaking, all kinds of\nthings are possible. As we have seen, he considers this concept of\n\u2018possible\u2019 after Mersenne introduces it in Second\nObjections:\n\nIf by \u2018possible\u2019 you mean what everyone commonly means,\nnamely \u2018whatever does not conflict with our human\nconcepts\u2019, then it is manifest that the nature of God, as I have\ndescribed it, is possible in this sense\u2026. (Second\nReplies, AT 7:150, CSM 2:107)\n\n\nHere Descartes might seem to be offering a theory of possibility\naccording to which what it means for something to be possible is just\nfor it to be conceivable (Bennett 1994, 647\u201349). However, this\ncannot be Descartes\u2019 view. Descartes holds that whatever we\nclearly and distinctly perceive is true and that truth is \u201cthe\nconformity of thought with its object\u201d (\u201cTo Mersenne, 16\nOctober 1639,\u201d AT 2:597, CSMK 139). If a possibility that we are\nconsidering is clearly and distinctly perceived, then our clear and\ndistinct perception conforms to reality, and the possibility that we\nare conceiving is not merely conceptual. Instead, there is also an\nobject to which the clear and distinct perception conforms \u2013 the\nsort of thing posited by commentators who argue that Descartes holds\nthat God\u2019s creation consists not only of actuals but of\nunactualized possibles. Thus, for any possibility of which we have a\nconception, if there is no object to which that conception conforms\n\u2013 that is, if the possibility exists only in thought\n\u2013 the possibility is not clearly and distinctly perceived.\nPossibilities which exist only in thought are not part of\nDescartes\u2019 ontology and so on Descartes\u2019 view are not\npossibilities at all. Descartes\u2019 remarks to Mersenne actually\nbear this out. He is indeed considering the view of possibility as\nconceivability, but in doing so he is merely acknowledging what\n\u201ceveryone commonly means\u201d by \u2018possible\u2019.\nDescartes sometimes speaks of the possible as clearly and distinctly\nperceived. It is on these passages that any interpretation of\nDescartes\u2019 views on possibility must be built.\n",
