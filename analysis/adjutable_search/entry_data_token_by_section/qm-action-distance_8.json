    "main_text": "Holism, non-separability and action at a distance in quantum mechanics || Can action-at-a-distance co-exist with non-separability and holism?\n5.2 Can action-at-a-distance co-exist with non-separability and holism?\n\n\nThe action at a distance in the GRW/Pearle models is different from\nthe Newtonian action at a distance in various respects. First, in\ncontrast to Newtonian action at a distance, this action is independent\nof the distance between the measurement events. Second, while\nNewtonian action is symmetric, the action in the GRW/Pearle models is\n(generally) asymmetric: Either the L-measurement influences the\nproperties of the R-particle or the R-measurement influences the\nproperties of the L-particle, depending on which measurement occurs\nfirst (the action will be symmetric when both measurements occur\nsimultaneously). Third (and more important to our consideration), in\ncontrast to Newtonian action at a distance, before the end of the\nL-measurement the state of the L-apparatus and the R-particle is not\nseparable and accordingly it is not clear that the influence is\nbetween separate existences, as the case is supposed to be in\nNewtonian gravity.\n\n\nThis non-separability of the states of the particle pair and the\nL-measurement apparatus, and more generally the fact that the\nnon-locality in collapse theories is due to state non-separability, has\nled a number of philosophers and physicists to think that wave\ncollapses do not involve action at a distance. Yet, the question of\nwhether there is an action at a distance in the GRW/Pearle models (and\nvarious other quantum theories) depends on how we interpret the term\n\u2018action at a distance.\u2019 And, as I will suggest below, on a\nnatural reading of Isaac Newton's and Samuel Clarke's\ncomments concerning action at a distance, there may be a peaceful\ncoexistence between action at a distance and non-separability and\nholism.\n\n\nNewton famously struggled to find out the cause of\n gravity.[12]\n In a letter to Bentley, dated January 17 1692/3, he said:\n\n\nYou sometimes speak of Gravity as essential and inherent to Matter.\nPray do not ascribe that Notion to me, for the Cause of Gravity is what\nI do not pretend to know, and therefore would take more Time to\nconsider it. (Cohen 1978, p. 298)\n\n\nIn a subsequent letter to Bentley, dated February 25, 1692/3, he\nadded:\n\n\nIt is inconceivable that inanimate Matter should, without the\nMediation of something else, which is not material, operate upon, and\naffect other matter without mutual Contact\u2026That Gravity should\nbe innate, inherent and essential to Matter, so that one body may act\nupon another at a distance thro\u2019 a Vacuum, without the Mediation\nof any thing else, by and through which their Action and Force may be\nconveyed from one to another, is to me so great an Absurdity that I\nbelieve no Man who has in philosophical Matters a competent Faculty of\nthinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an Agent\nacting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this Agent be\nmaterial or immaterial, I have left to the Consideration of my\nreaders. (Cohen 1978, pp. 302-3)\n\n\nSamuel Clarke, Newton's follower, similarly struggled with the\nquestion of the cause of gravitational phenomenon. In his famous\ncontroversy with Leibniz, he\n said:[13]\n\n\nThat one body attracts another without any intermediate means, is\nindeed not a miracle but a contradiction; for 'tis supposing\nsomething to act where it is not. But the means by which two bodies\nattract each other, may be invisible and intangible and of a different\nnature from mechanism \u2026\n\n\nAnd he added:\n\n\nThat this phenomenon is not produced sans moyen, that is\nwithout a cause capable of producing such an effect, is undoubtedly\ntrue. Philosophers therefore can search after and discover that cause,\nif they can; be it mechanical or not. But if they cannot discover the\ncause, is therefore the effect itself, the phenomenon, or the matter of\nfact discovered by experience \u2026 ever the less true?\n\n\nNewton's and Clarke's comments suggest that for them\ngravity was a law-governed phenomenon, i.e., a phenomenon in which\nobjects influence each other at a distance according to the Newtonian\nlaw of gravity, and that this influence is due to some means which may\nbe invisible and intangible and of a different nature from mechanism.\nOn this conception of action at a distance, there seems to be no reason\nto exclude the possibility of action at a distance in the quantum realm\neven if that realm is holistic or the state of the relevant systems is\nnon-separable. That is, action at a distance may be characterized as\nfollows:\n\nAction at a distance is a phenomenon in which a\nchange in intrinsic properties of one system induces a change in the\nintrinsic properties of a distant system, independently of the\ninfluence of any other systems on the distant system, and without\nthere being a process that carries this influence contiguously in space\nand time.\n \n\n\nWe may alternatively characterize action at a distance in a more\nliberal way:\n\nAction* at a distance is a phenomenon in which a\nchange in intrinsic properties of one system induces a change in the\nintrinsic properties of a distant system without there being a process\nthat carries this influence contiguously in space and time.\n \n\n\nAnd while Newton and Clarke did not have an explanation for the action\nat a distance involved in Newtonian gravity, on the above\ncharacterizations action at a distance in the quantum realm would be\nexplained by the holistic nature of the quantum realm and/or\nnon-separability of the states of the systems involved. In particular,\nif in the EPR/B experiment the L-apparatus pointer has a definite\nposition before the L-measurement and the R-particle temporarily comes\nto possess definite position during the L-measurement, then the\nGRW/Pearle models involve action at a distance and thus also action*\nat a distance. On the other hand, if the R-particle never comes to\npossess a definite position during the L-measurement, then the\nGRW/Pearle models only involve action* at a distance.\n",
