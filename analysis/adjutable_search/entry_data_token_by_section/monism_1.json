    "main_text": "Monisms || Important examples\n1.2 Important examples\n\nI now mention some of the more interesting target-unit pairs, leading\nto a list of some of the more interesting monisms. To begin with, on\nperhaps the most general level, one may target the categories\nthemselves, and consider whether the schedule of categories has\nvarious sorts of unity. There are at least two interesting sorts of\nunity to consider: (i) the number of categories (including\nsubcategories), and (ii) the number of highest categories (excluding\nsubcategories).\n\nAs to the first sort of unity concerning the number of categories,\nsome posit a categorical distinction between object and\nproperty, thereby recognizing a pluralism of at least two\ncategories. But others would prefer the elegant monistic picture of a\n\u201cone category ontology\u201d: for instance, some trope\ntheorists and property-only theorists claim a property-only schedule,\nor a schedule that effaces the object/property distinction (Williams\n1953; Campbell 1990; Paul 2013); and eliminative nominalists claim an\nobject-only schedule (Rodriguez-Pereyra 2002).\n\nAs to the second sort of unity concerning the number of highest\ncategories, those who are pluralists about the number of categories\nstill may (or may not) posit one highest category\u2014a summum\ngenus, such as entity or being\u2014under\nwhich all the entities in the lower categories fall. Spinoza\n(Ethics IV pref., II: 207), for instance, is a pluralist\nabout the categories but a monist about the highest categories,\npositing a categorical divide between substance and\nmode but unifying both under being: \n\n\nWe are accustomed to refer all individuals in nature to one genus\nwhich is called the most general, that is, to the notion of Being,\nwhich embraces absolutely all the individuals in nature.\n\n\nWhile Aristotle is a pluralist about both the categories and the\nhighest categories, denying that there is any higher category above\nhis substance, quantity, quality,\n etc.[3]\n\nMoving down from the level of the categories themselves, one may\ntarget a particular type of entity, and consider whether that type has\nvarious sorts of unity. Of special interest to the discussion to come\nis the concrete material realm as a target. For this target there are\nat least four interesting sorts of unity to consider: (i) the number\nof types (including subtypes), (ii) the number of highest types\n(excluding subtypes), (iii) the number of tokens (including derivative\ntokens), and (iv) the number of basic tokens (excluding derivative\ntokens). The neutral monist (as per above) is a pluralist about the\nnumber of types, but a monist about the number of highest types. On\nher view there are material and mental types, but both fall under a\nhigher neutral type from which the material and the mental are\nderivative. The priority monist (as per above) may well be a pluralist\nabout the number of tokens, but is a monist about the number of basic\ntokens. On this view there are many concrete objects other than the\none fundamental whole, but these other objects are all\n\u201cshards\u201d: derivative fragments of the One.\n\nThe abstract realm is another interesting target. For this target it\nis not obvious that there is a sensible type/token\n distinction.[4]\n So only two of the four natural count policies for concrete objects\nseem applicable: (i) the number of abstract objects (including\nderivative ones), and (ii) the number of basic abstract objects\n(excluding derivative ones). So consider the hierarchy of pure set\ntheoretic objects. One might very naturally be a pluralist about the\nnumber of pure set-theoretic abstracta that exist, but a monist about\nthe number of basic set-theoretic abstracta, insofar as one holds that\nthe entire transfinite hierarchy is founded upon a single element: the\nempty set. Those who reject abstract objects altogether will obviously\nbe nihilists on either count policy (c.f. Goodman and Quine 1947).\n\nIn general, for any target that supports a type/token\ndistinction\u2014perhaps for any concrete target\u2014it seems that\nthere will be at least the four natural count policies as seen with\nconcrete objects. While for any target that does not support a\ntype/token distinction\u2014perhaps for any abstract target\u2014it\nseems that there will only be the two natural count policies as seen\nwith abstract objects. To further illustrate these patterns: with\nconcrete events, one might count by types, highest types, tokens, or\nbasic tokens. While with abstract Platonic universals, one might count\nthe number of forms, or the number of basic forms. For example, Plato\nis a pluralist about the number of forms, but a monist about the\nnumber of basic forms, maintaining that they are all sustained by the\nform of the\n good.[5]\n\nMoving down from targets that concern a particular type of entity, one\nmight also target a particular token entity, and consider whether it\nhas various sorts of unity. A dizzying variety of natural count\npolicies present themselves. A particular concrete object might, for\ninstance, be counted by (i) the number of its parts, (ii) the number\nof its atomic parts, (iii) the number of its maximally continuous\nparts, (iv) the number of its functionally integrated parts, or (v)\nthe number of its qualitatively homogeneous parts. So if one considers\na chess set, one might count it functionally as 1 (1 chess set), by\nits connected parts as 33 (32 pieces and 1 board), by its homogeneous\nparts as 96 (32 pieces plus 64 squares), by its atomic parts as\nbazillions of particles, and by its parts as\n\\(2^n -1\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of its\natomic\n parts.[6]\n Obviously many other count policies are available. It is not clear\nthat there is more to be said of a systematic nature about natural\ncount policies for various particular entities.\n\nThere is one count policy of some metaphysical interest worth\nmentioning, which is to count by the number of individuals\n(self-identicals) present. Thus one might say, for a given target,\nthat there are exactly three individuals involved. Restricting our\ndomain of quantification to the target, this would be to uphold the\nformula:\n\n\n\\(\\exists x\\exists y\\exists z(x\\ne y \\amp x\\ne z \\amp y\\ne z \\amp \\forall v(v=x \\vee v=y \\vee v=z))\\)\n\n\nUnless one thinks that identity itself is a relative notion (Geach\n1962), or that there is some other problem with this formalism, this\nformula represents a perfectly legitimate count policy. My point is\nthat it is not the only legitimate count policy. It is perfectly\nlegitimate to count the copse as one, without denying the presence of\nthe five trees, or identifying them.\n\nPutting this together, here is a list of some of the more interesting\nexamples of monistic doctrines mentioned above:\n\n Genus monism: target: categories; unit: highest type\n(the doctrine that there is a highest category; e.g., being)\n Substance monism: target: concreta; unit: highest type\n(the doctrine that all concreta are of a common type; e.g.,\nmaterialism)\n Property monism: target: properties; unit: highest type\n(the doctrine that all properties are of a common type; e.g., physical\nproperties)\n Existence monism: target: concreta; unit: tokens (the\ndoctrine that there is exactly one concretum)\n Priority monism: target: concreta; unit: basic tokens\n(the doctrine that there is exactly one fundamental concretum)\n\n\nThis list is not intended to be exhaustive, but just to indicate a\nhandful of the more interesting monisms, and classify them with\nrespect to their associated target and\n unit.[7]\n\nMost of these five monisms are independent, though there are the\nfollowing logical relations. Pluralism about the number of basic\ntokens for some concrete category entails pluralism about the\nrespective number of tokens. In the other direction, both monism and\nnihilism about the number of tokens for some concrete category entails\na corresponding monism or nihilism about the respective number of\nbasic tokens. Further, nihilism about the number of highest types for\nany concrete category entails nihilism about the number of tokens (and\nthus the number of basic tokens) for that category.\n\nThus with existence monism and priority monism (the\nmain foci of what follows), one finds the following logical relations:\nexistence monism entails priority monism, and priority pluralism\nentails existence pluralism. But otherwise the views are independent.\nSo for instance, one might be an existence pluralist but a priority\nmonist. This would be to maintain that many things exist (not just the\nworld, but also persons, furniture, particles, and whatnot), but that\nthe whole world is basic. The partialia are merely dependent\nfragments. It may be that this is the view that most historical\nmonists have held, and that especially deserves serious\n attention.[8]\n",
