Botany, Agriculture, Horticulture\n\nIn Villae (Estates) Porta presented a true summa of\nancient and modern forestry, agriculture, and horticulture as it had\nbeen known and practiced in Europe. Villae are organized in a scenic\nmanner, \u201can imaginary round tour through an open air\ntheater\u201d (Orsi 2005, 53). The reader is guided through the\ndiverse zones of an imaginary vast country estate. Some scholars have\nclaimed that the Villae can also be read a veiled criticism of the\npolicies of Spanish agriculture (Orsi 2005, Rusu 2020).\n\nEmphasizing first hand experience, Porta\u2019s Villae focuses on\nplants cultivated in Puglia and the Capitanato, the province\nsurrounding Naples. Even though Villae was not a big success, it\nimplicitly catered to a way of life that took its inspiration from\nCicero\u2019s ideal of an independent life (Orsi, 2005, 2008). This\nwent well with a trend in Porta\u2019s day among the ruling classes\nto move to the countryside, which also resulted in the construction of\nsome of Andrea Palladio\u2019s most impressive rural villas.\n\nReferring to classical treaties by Theophrastus, Columella, Pliny,\nVirgil, and more recent authors as for instance Pontano and\nSannazzaro, Porta discusses plants that had been known and in use\nbefore the discovery of the Americas. Even so Villae was innovative in\nseveral respects: it was the first text to dedicate an entire treatise\nto the cultivation of olives, as well as one on on grafting. This\nlatter topic is especially interesting because it firmly links Portas\nagriculture to his ideas on natural magic. In general the Villae\nbetray an implicit astrological agenda as Porta conceives of plants as\nrecipients of celestial influx. As Wechsel, Porta\u2019s German\npublisher of the Villae, noted with exasperation, the long manuscript\nwas in such a terrible state, fraught with so many grammatical and\northographic errors that it had to be most thoroughly emended; yet and\nregrettably in several places the meaning of a passage \u201cwas not\nto be recovered by another Oedipus.\u201d Even though Wechsel\nexonerates the author by putting the blame on a corrupt manuscript,\nhis vindication of Porta remains ambiguous because the editor also\nsays that the extent of his emendations become obvious in a comparison\nof his edition to the Olivetum, which had been published eight years\nearlier, in 1584. Much the same can be said about the De furtivis\nlitterarum notis, which is fraught with misspellings, no small matter\nin a text that is on decoding. These examples indicate that Porta was\nmuch more of a prolific author than a careful editor of his texts.\n",
