    "main_text": "Philosophy of Science || Biological Purpose of Science\n4.3 Biological Purpose of Science\n\n\nOnce science is placed within an evolutionary context, Mach\u2019s\nteleological views of evolution (see section 3.4) become significant\nfor his philosophy of science. The developmental processes of\nevolution have given rise to this complex human activity we call\nscience, which now itself is participating in the processes of\nevolution. Just as the eye, for instance, has evolved to better\naid us in adapting to a greater variety of landscapes, so science has\nevolved to better aid us in adapting to the world:\n\n\nScience apparently grew out of biological and cultural development\nas its most superfluous offshoot. However, today we can hardly\ndoubt that it has developed into the factor that is biologically and\nculturally the most beneficial. Science has taken over the task\nof replacing tentative and unconscious adaptation by a faster variety\nthat is fully conscious and methodical. [KE: 361]\n\n\n\n\nScience is both an outcome of this process (it has\nbiological roots), and also now is part of this process (it\nhas a biological function continuous with other evolutionary\nprocesses). Leaves, hearts, brains, eyes, and science are on a\ncontinuum in as much as they arose out of adaptive processes and now\nserve the biological function of survival and further adaptation.\n\n\nMan is governed by the struggle for self preservation: his\nwhole activity is in its service, and only achieves with richer\nresources, what the reflexes accomplish in the lower organisms under\nsimpler conditions of life. Every recollection, every idea, every\npiece of knowledge has a value originally only in so far as it directly\nfurthers man in the direction indicated. [PH: 336]\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that Mach does not argue or provide evidence for\nthis evolutionary view of science; he seems rather to adopt it from\nideas that were being circulated in the later half of the nineteenth\ncentury.  Nonetheless, references to a deep evolutionary perspective\npermeate his writings.  For instance:\n\nThe biological task of science is to provide the fully developed\nhuman with as perfect a means of orientating himself as possible.\nNo other scientific ideal can be realized, and any other must be\nmeaningless. [AS: 37]\nAnd also:\n\n\nThe adaptation of thoughts to facts, accordingly, is the aim of all\nscientific research. In this, science only deliberately and\nconsciously pursues what in daily life goes on unnoticed and of its own\naccord. [AS: 316]\n\nThis evolutionary perspective even plays a critical role in his\nunderstanding of physics.  For instance, in his famous exchange with\nPlanck (see 5.3), Mach repeatedly refers to his biologico-economical\ntheory of knowledge as an important part of view of the physical\nworld.\n",
