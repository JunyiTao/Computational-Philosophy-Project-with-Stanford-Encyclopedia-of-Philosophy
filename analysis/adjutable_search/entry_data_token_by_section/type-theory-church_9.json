    "main_text": "Metatheory || Expansion Proofs\n3.5 Expansion Proofs\n\nAn expansion proof is a generalization of the notion of a\nHerbrand expansion of a theorem of first-order logic; it provides a\nvery elegant, concise, and nonredundant representation of the\nrelationship between the theorem and a tautology which can be obtained\nfrom it by appropriate instantiations of quantifiers and which\nunderlies various proofs of the theorem. Miller (1987) proved that a\nwff \\(\\bA\\) is a theorem of elementary type theory if and only if\n\\(\\bA\\) has an expansion proof.\n\nIn Brown 2004 and 2007, this concept is generalized to that of an\nextensional expansion proof to obtain an analogous theorem\ninvolving type theory with extensionality.\n",
