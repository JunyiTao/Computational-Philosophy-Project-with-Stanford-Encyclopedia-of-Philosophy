    "main_text": "Other Pythagoreans of the Sixth, Fifth and Fourth Centuries || Timaeus, Ocellus, Hicetas and Ecphantus\n3.6 Timaeus, Ocellus, Hicetas and Ecphantus\n\nThe names Timaeus of Locri and Ocellus of Lucania are famous as the\nauthors of the two most influential Pythagorean pseudepigrapha (see\nbelow, sect. 4.2). In his catalogue of Pythagoreans, Iamblichus lists\nan Ocellus under Lucania and two men named Timaeus, neither under\nLocri. The later forgery of works attributed to Timaeus and Ocellus\ndoes not of course mean that Pythagoreans of these names did not\nexist, and it is possible that the Timaeus of Locri who is the main\nspeaker in Plato\u2019s Timaeus was an historical Timaeus\n(some have thought Plato uses him as a mask for Archytas, however). If\nthey really did exist, however, nothing is known about them, since all\nother reports in the ancient tradition are likely to be based on\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus or the spurious works in their\nname.\n\nSome scholars have argued that Hicetas and Ecphantus, both of\nSyracuse, were not historical figures at all but rather characters in\ndialogues written by Heraclides of Pontus, a fourth-century member of\nthe Academy. By a misunderstanding, they came to be treated as\nhistorical Pythagoreans in the doxographical tradition (see Guthrie\n1962, 323 ff. for references). This theory arose because both Hicetas\nand Ecphantus are said to have made the earth rotate on its axis,\nwhile the heavens remained fixed, in order to explain astronomical\nphenomena, and, in one report, Heraclides is paired with Ecphantus as\nhaving adopted this view (Aetius III 13.3 =DK I 442.23). In addition\nEcphantus is assigned a form of atomism (DK I 442.7 ff.) similar to\nthat assigned to Heraclides (Fr. 118\u2013121 Wehrli). It is not\nuncommon in the doxographical tradition for a report of the form\n\u201cx and y believe z\u201d to mean that \u201cy, as reported by\nx, believes z,\u201d so it is suggested that in this case\n\u201cHeraclides and Ecphantus\u201d means \u201cEcphantus as\npresented by Heraclides.\u201d There is a serious problem with this\ningenious theory. The doxographical reports about Hicetas and\nEcphantus ultimately rely on Theophrastus (Cicero mentions\nTheophrastus by name at DK I 441.27), and it is implausible that\nTheophrastus would treat characters invented by his older\ncontemporary, Heraclides, as historical figures. Theophrastus did\naccept the Academic glorification of Pythagoras (see on\nNeopythagoreanism below, sect. 4.1), but this provides no grounds for\nsupposing that he accepted a character in a dialogue as a historical\nperson (pace Burkert 1972a, 341).\n\nThe testimonia for Hicetas are meager and contradictory (DK I\n441\u2013442). He appears to have argued that the celestial phenomena\nare best explained by assuming that all heavenly bodies are stationary\nand that the apparent movement of the stars and planets is the result\nof the earth\u2019s rotation around its own axis. He may also have\nfollowed Philolaus in positing a counter-earth, opposite the earth on\nthe other side of a central fire, although, if he did, it is unclear\nhow he would have explained why it and the central fire are not\nvisible from the rotating earth. In Philolaus\u2019 system the\ncentral fire remains invisible because the earth orbits the central\nfire as it rotates on its axis, thus keeping one side of the earth\nalways turned away from the central fire. A little more is known about\nEcphantus (DK I 442). He too is said to have believed that the earth\nmoved, not by changing its location (as Philolaus proposed, in making\nthe earth and counter-earth revolve around the central fire: see\nSection 4.2 of the entry on\n Philolaus),\n but by rotating on its axis.\n\nCopernicus was inspired by these testimonia about Hicetas and\nEcphantus, as well as those about Philolaus, to consider the motion of\nthe earth (see below, sect. 5.2). Ecphantus developed his own original\nform of atomism. He is best understood as reacting to and developing\nthe views of Democritus. He agreed with Democritus 1) \u201cthat\nhuman beings do not grasp true knowledge of the things that are, but\ndefine them as they believe them to be\u201d (DK I 442.7\u20138; cf.\nDemocritus Frs. 6\u201310) and 2) that all sensible things arise from\nindivisible first bodies and void. He differs from Democritus,\nhowever, in supposing that atoms are limited rather than unlimited in\nnumber and that there is just one cosmos rather than many. As in\nDemocritus, atoms differ in shape and size, but Ecphantus adds power\n(dynamis) as a third distinguishing factor. He explains\natomic motion not just in terms of weight and external blows, as the\natomists did, but also by a divine power, which he called mind or\nsoul, so that \u201cthe cosmos was composed of atoms but organized by\nprovidence\u201d (DK I 442.21\u201322). It is because of this divine\npower that the cosmos is spherical in shape. This unique spherical\ncosmos is reminiscent of Plato\u2019s Timaeus, but the rest\nof Ecphantus\u2019 system differs enough from Plato that there is no\nquestion of its being a forgery based on the Timaeus. One\ntestimony says that he was the first to make Pythagorean monads\ncorporeal, thus differing from the fifth-century Pythagoreans\ndescribed by Aristotle, who do not seem to have addressed the question\nof whether numbers were physical entities or not.\n\nIt is difficult to be sure of the date of either Hicetas or Ecphantus.\nSince, however, both seem to be influenced by Philolaus\u2019 idea of\na moving earth and since Ecphantus appears to be developing the\natomism of Democritus, it is usually assumed that they belong to the\nfirst half of the fourth century (Guthrie 1962, 325\u2013329; Zhmud\n2012a, 130). Hicetas does not appear in Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue.\nThere is an Ecphantus in the catalogue, but he is listed under Croton\nrather than Syracuse, so it cannot be certain whether he is the\nEcphantus described in the doxography.\n",
