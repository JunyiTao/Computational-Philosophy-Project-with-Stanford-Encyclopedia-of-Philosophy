    "main_text": "Philosophies of Facts || Facts and Knowledge\n1.3 Facts and Knowledge\n\n\u201cKnow\u201d in instances of the locution \u201c\\(x\\) knows\nthat \\(p\\)\u201d is factive: if \\(x\\) knows that \\(p\\), then \\(p\\).\nSimilarly, \u201cknow\u201d in instances of the locution\n\u201c\\(x\\) knows \\(y\\)\u201d is veridical: if \\(x\\) knows \\(y\\), is\nacquainted with \\(y\\), then there is a \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) knows\n\\(y\\).\n\nIs knowledge that \\(p\\) knowledge of facts? Is coming to know (cf.\n\u201cErkennen\u201d) that \\(p\\) a form of contact with\nfacts, where facts are understood as something other than true\ntruth-bearers? Husserl, Russell, Vendler and Hossack (Husserl\n1900\u20131901; Russell 1906\u20131907; Vendler 1967a, 1972; Hossack\n2007) reply affirmatively to one of these questions; thus Russell at\none point argues that a perception has a single object, such as\n\u201cknife-to-left-of-book\u201d, an entity he first called a\n\u201ccomplex\u201d and then \u201ca fact\u201d (Russell\nONTF). From Ramsey to Williamson (Ramsey 1927 [1931]; Vickers\n2004; Williamson 2000) many philosophers have replied negatively.\n\nWhat may be said in favor of the view? Consider the atomic predication\nFa, where this is a formula that a logician would use to\nrepresent the claim that object a has property F.\nComing to know that Fa, in the simplest cases, involves\nacquaintance with objects and properties. Coming to know that the wall\nis red by seeing that it is red often involves seeing the wall. The\nwall is not any sort of concept. According to a popular theory in\nperceptual psychology, seeing that the wall is red or straight\ntypically involves perception of a constant property, the redness or\nstraightness of the wall, and perception of it as constant\n(\u201cproperty constancy\u201d, \u201ccolor constancy\u201d,\n\u201cshape constancy\u201d). These properties are not concepts.\nThere is thus some reason for thinking that perceptually coming to\nknow that \\(p\\), in the simplest cases, involves epistemic contact\nwith objects and with properties. If that is right, then two\ncomponents of the view that to come to know that \\(p\\) in such cases\nis to come to have knowledge of facts are plausible. But even if\nperceptual knowledge of facts is allowed, it is not clear why one\nshould think that instances of \u201cknowledge that \\(p\\)\u201d or\nof \u201ccoming to know that \\(p\\)\u201d in which the substitutions\nfor \u201c\\(p\\)\u201d are logically complex, constitute knowledge of\nrobust facts. Similarly, if we consider the many and various types of\ncoming to know that \\(p\\) in which the source of knowledge is not\nsensory perception but, for example, testimony or inference, we may\nthink that in such cases there is no reason to think that what we come\nto know are facts.\n\nKratzer\u2019s (2002) account of knowledge of facts is applied to\nGettier problems (Gettier 1963, see the entry on\n the analysis of knowledge).\n She puts forward a view according to which facts are particulars\nwhich exemplify propositions (cf. Baylis 1948)\u2014just as other\nparticulars such as tables and persons exemplify properties. (She\nmodels these facts and propositions within Situation Semantics, as\nsituations of a certain sort and sets of situations, respectively, but\nwe need not go into the details here. Note that, as we saw in\n section 1.2\n above, she also countenances facts which are propositions.)\nShe then proposes the following analysis of knowledge:\n\n\n\\(S\\) knows \\(p\\) if and only if\n\nThere is a fact \\(f\\) that exemplifies \\(p\\),\n\\(S\\) believes \\(p\\) de re of \\(f\\), and\n\\(S\\) can rule out relevant possible alternatives of \\(f\\) that do\nnot exemplify \\(p\\).\n\n\n\nIt is condition (ii), Kratzer argues, which deals with Gettier cases.\nTake the second type of case discussed by Gettier. Smith is justified\nin believing the false proposition that Jones owns a Ford. Therefore\nhe is justified in believing the proposition that Jones owns a Ford or\nBrown is in Barcelona. Now Brown happens to be in Barcelona, but Smith\nhas no idea about where Brown is\u2014in particular, he is not\njustified in believing that Brown is in Barcelona. Intuitively, Smith\ndoes not know the disjunctive proposition he is justified in\nbelieving. But that proposition is true, and so the standard analysis\nof knowledge fails. The analysis in terms of beliefs de re of\nfacts fares better, Kratzer argues. For, she claims, the fact\nexemplified by the disjunctive proposition is the fact that Brown is\nin Barcelona, and Smith\u2019s belief is not a de re belief\nabout that fact.\n",
