    "main_text": "What is Moral Theory? What is Bioethics? || Varying Accounts of Moral Theory\n1.1 Varying Accounts of Moral Theory\n\nOn some accounts, a theoretical approach to a philosophical issue or\nproblem is defined by intellectual tendencies toward some combination\nof generalization, universality, systemization, abstraction,\nexplicitness, and the capability to generate recommendations. For\ninstance, Martha Nussbaum holds that there are certain necessary and\nsufficient criteria for ethical theory (Nussbaum 2000: 234\u2013236).\nOn her view, ethical theory:\n\nGives recommendations about practical problems;\nShows how to test correctness of beliefs, rules, and\nprinciples;\nSystematizes and extends beliefs;\nHas some degree of abstractness and generality;\nIs universalizable;\nIs explicit.\n\n\nGeneralization, universality, and abstraction are also taken by others\nto be hallmarks of moral theory (Arras 1997: 74; 2003; Louden 1990).\nEven so, some philosophical approaches to moral and bioethical\nquestions that do not satisfy all or even any of the criteria set out\nabove are referred to as theories. For instance, moral particularism,\nwhich aspires neither to the formulation of generalizations nor to\nsystemization\n [2]\n is sometimes referred to as a moral\n theory.[3]\n Further still, one might even hold that beyond the criteria listed\nabove, moral theory employs a certain argumentative mode, with a\ncertain tone and style (Louden 1992: 156; Nussbaum 2000: 239).\n\nThere is more one could say here on agreement and disagreement on what\ncounts as theoretical within philosophy, including something about\nwhat might qualify as an anti-theoretical approach to morality and\nbioethics (Clarke 1987; Clarke & Simpson 1989; Fotion 2014; Louden\n1990). But our main point for the moment is that what counts as moral\ntheory is not perfectly clear, which complicates the question of the\nrelation between moral theory and bioethics. We need not here\nstipulate one definition of what we shall count as a theoretical\napproach to bioethical problems moving forward. Suffice it to say that\nthe question of the relation between theory and bioethics will be\napproached by canvassing various methodological approaches to treating\nproblems and questions in bioethics.\n",
