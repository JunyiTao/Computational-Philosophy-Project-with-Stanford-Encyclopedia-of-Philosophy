    "main_text": "Arguments against Ethical Supervenience, or its Significance || Arguments against supervenience from thick ethical concepts\n5.1 Arguments against supervenience from thick ethical concepts\n\nIt is now common to distinguish thick ethical concepts\u2014like\ncourage\u2014from thin ethical concepts\u2014like\nought or good (for an introduction to thick ethical\nconcepts, see Roberts 2017). Courage seems like an ethical concept: we\nexpect each other to treat courage as a virtue and not a vice.\nHowever, competent use of thick ethical concepts seems to require\nrecognition that only certain sorts of grounds make an ascription of\nsuch a concept apt. To adapt Monty Python\u2019s example, it seems\nconceptually inapt to say that Sir Robin was courageous in\nlight of running away from battle, even if we think that is what he\nought to have done.\n\nJonathan Dancy (1995, 278\u20139) and Debbie Roberts (2018) have\nsuggested that attention to thick ethical concepts casts doubt on\nethical supervenience. The core idea is this: it is true that there\nare no thin ethical differences between otherwise identical\ncircumstances. However, it is suggested that sometimes the thin\nethical properties of an action or event are best explained by citing\nthick ethical properties. And it is claimed that it is not at all\nclear that these thick ethical properties can always be explained in\npurely base terms (see especially Roberts 2017a).\n\nA natural objection to this strategy is to point out that the\nsupervenience of the thick on the base properties is, if anything, far\nmore plausible than the supervenience of the thin. For example, it is\nvery hard to believe that two possible worlds could be wholly\nbase-identical, but be such that Doris\u2019s action is brave in the\nfirst world, but not brave in the second.\n",
