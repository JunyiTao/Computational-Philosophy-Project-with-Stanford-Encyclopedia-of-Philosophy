    "main_text": "Systems Closely Related to Mainstream Relevance Logic\n7. Applications and Extensions of Relevance Logic\n\nApart from the motivating applications of providing better formalisms\nof our pre-formal notions of implication and entailment and providing\na basis for na\u00efve set theory, relevance logic has been put to\nvarious uses in philosophy and computer science. Here I will list just\na few.\n\nDunn has developed a theory of intrinsic and essential properties\nbased on relevant logic. This is his theory of relevant\npredication. Briefly put, a thing \\(i\\) has a property\n\\(F\\) relevantly iff \\(\\forall x(x{=}i \\rightarrow F(x))\\). Informally, an object has a property\nrelevantly if being that thing relevantly implies having that\nproperty. Since the truth of the consequent of a relevant implication\nis by itself insufficient for the truth of that implication, things\ncan have properties irrelevantly as well as relevantly. Dunn\u2019s\nformulation would seem to capture at least one sense in which we use\nthe notion of an intrinsic property. Adding modality to the language\nallows for a formalisation of the notion of an essential property as a\nproperty that is had both necessarily and intrinsically (see Anderson,\nBelnap, and Dunn 1992, \u00a774).\n\nRelevant logic has been used as the basis for mathematical theories\nother than set theory. Meyer has produced a variation of Peano\narithmetic based on the logic \\(\\mathbf{R}\\). Meyer gave a\nfinitary proof that his relevant arithmetic does not have \\(0 = 1\\) as a\ntheorem. Thus Meyer solved one of Hilbert\u2019s central problems in the\ncontext of relevant arithmetic; he showed using finitary means that\nrelevant arithmetic is absolutely consistent. This makes relevant\nPeano arithmetic an extremely interesting theory. Unfortunately, as\nMeyer and Friedman have shown, relevant arithmetic does not contain\nall of the theorems of classical Peano arithmetic. Hence we cannot\ninfer from this that classical Peano arithmetic is absolutely\nconsistent (see Meyer and Friedman 1992).\n\nAnderson (1967) formulated a system of deontic logic based on\n\\(\\mathbf{R}\\) and, more recently, relevance logic has been used\nas a basis for deontic logic by Mares (1992) and Lou Goble (1999).\nThese systems avoid some of the standard problems with more\ntraditional deontic logics. One problem that standard deontic logics\nface is that they make valid the inference from \\(A\\)\u2019s being a\ntheorem to \\(OA\\)\u2019s being a theorem, where\n\u2018\\(OA\\)\u2019 means \u2018it ought to be that\n\\(A\\)\u2019. The reason that this problem arises is that it is\nnow standard to treat deontic logic as a normal modal logic. On the\nstandard semantics for modal logic, if \\(A\\) is valid, then it is\ntrue at all possible worlds. Moreover, \\(OA\\) is true at a world\n\\(a\\) if and only if \\(A\\) is true at every world accessible\nto \\(a\\). Thus, if \\(A\\) is a valid formula, then so is\n\\(OA\\). But it seems silly to say that every valid formula ought\nto be the case. Why should it be the case that either it is now\nraining in Ecuador or it is not? In the semantics for relevant logics,\nnot every world makes true every valid formula. Only a special class\nof worlds (sometimes called \u201cbase worlds\u201d and sometimes\ncalled \u201cnormal worlds\u201d) make true the valid formulae. Any\nvalid formula can fail at a world. By allowing these \u201cnon-normal\nworlds\u201d in our models, we invalidate this problematic rule.\n\nOther sorts of modal operators have been added to relevance logic as\nwell. Fuhrmann (1990) adapts the usual axioms for the familiar\nclassical modal logics to the relevant context to produce a collection\nof relevant modal logics and proves completeness results for them.\nEpistemic modal operators have been added to relevance logics by\nHeinrich Wansing (2002), Marta Bilkova, Ondrej Majer, Michal\nPeli\u0161, and Greg Restall (2010), among others. Shawn Standefer\n(2019) has produced a relevant version of justification logic and has\nvery recently added an actuality opertor to relevance logic. There is\neven a relevant logic of questions and answers (see\nPun\u010doch\u00e1\u0159 2020).\n\nRoutley and Val Plumwood (1989) and Mares and Andr\u00e9 Fuhrmann\n(1995) present theories of counterfactual conditionals based on\nrelevant logic. Their semantics adds to the standard Routley-Meyer\nsemantics an accessibility relation that holds between a formula and\ntwo worlds. On Routley and Plumwood\u2019s semantics, \\(A\\gt B\\)\nholds at a world \\(a\\) if and only if for all worlds \\(b\\) such that\n\\(SAab\\), \\(B\\) holds at \\(b\\). Mares and Fuhrmann\u2019s semantics\nis slightly more complex: \\(A\\gt B\\) holds at a world \\(a\\) if and\nonly if for all worlds \\(b\\) such that \\(SAab\\), \\(A \\rightarrow B\\)\nholds at \\(b\\) (also see Brady (ed.) 2002, \u00a710 for details of\nboth semantics). Mares (2004) presents a more complex theory of\nrelevant conditionals that includes counterfactual conditionals. All\nof these theories avoid the analogues of the paradoxes of implication\nthat appear in standard logics of counterfactuals.\n\nRelevant logics have been used in computer science as well as in\nphilosophy. Linear logics \u2014 a branch of logic initiated by\nJean-Yves Girard \u2014 is a logic of computational resources. Linear\nlogicians read an implication \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) as saying that\nhaving a resource of type \\(A\\) allows us to obtain something of type\n\\(B\\). If we have \\(A \\rightarrow(A \\rightarrow B)\\), then, we know\nthat we can obtain a \\(B\\) from two resources of type \\(A\\). But this\ndoes not mean that we can get a \\(B\\) from a single resource of type\n\\(A\\), i.e. we don\u2019t know whether we can obtain \\(A \\rightarrow\nB\\). Hence, contraction fails in linear logic. Linear logics are, in\nfact, relevant logics that lack contraction and the distribution of\nconjunction over disjunction \\(((A \\amp(B \\vee C)) \\rightarrow((A \\amp\nB) \\vee(A \\amp C)))\\). They also include two operators (! and ?) that\nare known as \u201cexponentials\u201d. Putting an exponential in\nfront of a formula gives that formula the ability to act classically,\nso to speak. For example, just as in standard relevance logic, we\ncannot usually merely add an extra premise to a valid inference and\nhave it remain valid. But we can always add a premise of the form\n\\(!A\\) to a valid inference and have it remain valid. Linear logic\nalso has contraction for formulae of the form \\(!A\\), i.e., it is a\ntheorem of these logics that \\((!A \\rightarrow(!A \\rightarrow B))\n\\rightarrow(!A \\rightarrow B)\\) (see Troelstra 1992). The use of !\nallows for the treatment of resources \u201cthat can be duplicated or\nignored at will\u201d (Restall 2000, p 56).
