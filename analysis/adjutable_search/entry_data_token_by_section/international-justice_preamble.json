    "main_text": "\n\nInternational distributive justice has, in the past several decades,\nbecome a prominent topic within political philosophy. Philosophers\nhave, of course, long been concerned with wealth and poverty, and with\nhow economic inequalities between persons might be justified. They\nhave, however, tended to focus only upon inequalities between\ninhabitants of the same state. In recent years, though, a sustained\nphilosophical dialogue has emerged on how these ideas might be applied\nto the relationships and institutions holding at the global level.\nThis dialogue has been prompted by issues of philosophy, but also by\nthe realities of globalization and global poverty; in a world as\nconnected as our own, is it justifiable that some have so much while\nothers have so little?\n\nThis entry is an introduction to the development of this dialogue. It\nis, perhaps, appropriate to start with some limitations. This entry\nwill discuss only the distributive aspects of international justice,\nrather than on all aspects of international relations and institutions\nthat might be morally important. Philosophical discussion of global\njustice has become sufficiently rich and complex that it is no longer\npossible to discuss all the various threads of this discussion in one\nentry (see Chatterjee [2011] for a more encyclopedic discussion of the\nvarious debates within global justice). This entry will, accordingly,\npass over such important topics as fairness in trade (Risse &\nWollner 2019; James 2012; Wenar 2010; Kurjanska & Risse 2008);\nimmigration (Blake forthcoming; D. Miller, 2016; Carens 2013; Wellman\n& Cole 2011; Carens 1987 [1995]); and gender (Kristof & WuDunn\n2009; Jaggar 2005; Nussbaum 2000). The fact that we do not discuss\nthese topics should not be read as implying their irrelevance; on the\ncontrary, they are enormously important for any adequate theory of\nglobal justice, and deserve more attention than we can provide\nhere. This entry will, moreover, discuss writings primarily within the\ntradition of liberal egalitarianism. Thinkers of a radical or a\nMarxist bent have had things to say about international justice, too,\nbut these writings are here largely ignored (see Kohn 2010, Humphrey\n2010, and Goto-Jones 2010 in Bell 2010, for discussions of these\ntopics). The entry is, finally, focused almost exclusively on fairly\nrecent writings. The reason for this is the simple fact, noted above,\nthat international justice has been a central research topic only in\nrecent years. This is emphatically not to say that less recent\nphilosophers have not had important things to say about international\njustice: Immanuel Kant\u2019s idea of a foedus pacificum\ncontinues to exert a strong influence over modern philosophical\nthought, for example, as does Mill\u2019s liberal nationalism (Kant\n1795; Mill 1859). The modern period, too, has seen some sustained\ndiscussion of global wealth and poverty, most notably in Peter\nSinger\u2019s discussion of the ethics of global famine relief\n(Singer 1972; see also Singer 2002). Nevertheless, the modern dialogue\nabout international distributive justice can be largely traced to the\ninitial publication of John Rawls\u2019s A Theory of Justice\nin 1971, and the prehistory of these ideas can be largely omitted in\nthe present context.\n",
