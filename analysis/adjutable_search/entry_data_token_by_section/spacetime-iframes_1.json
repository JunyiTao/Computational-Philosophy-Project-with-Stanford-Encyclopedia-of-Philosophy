    "main_text": "Relativity and reference frames in classical mechanics || Philosophical controversy over absolute and relative motion\n1.2 Philosophical controversy over absolute and relative motion\n\nLeibniz, later, articulated a more general \u201cequipollence of\nhypotheses\u201d: in any system of interacting bodies, any hypothesis\nthat any particular body is at rest is equivalent to any other.\nTherefore neither Copernicus\u2019 nor Ptolemy\u2019s view can be\ntrue\u2014though one may be judged simpler than the\nother\u2014because both are merely possible hypothetical\ninterpretations of the same relative motions. This principle clearly\ndefines (what we would call) a set of reference frames. They differ in\ntheir arbitrary choices of a resting point or origin, but agree on the\nrelative positions of bodies at any moment and their changing relative\ndistances through time.\n\nFor Leibniz and many others, this general equivalence was a matter of\nphilosophical principle, founded in the metaphysical conviction that\nspace itself is nothing more than an abstraction from the geometrical\nrelations among bodies. In some form or other it was a widely shared\ntenet of the 17th-century \u201cmechanical\nphilosophy\u201d. Yet it was flatly incompatible with physics as\nLeibniz himself, and the other \u201cmechanists,\u201d actually\nconceived it. For the basic program of mechanical explanation depended\nessentially on the concept of a privileged state of motion, as\nexpressed in the common assumption that was the forerunner of the\n\u201cprinciple of inertia\u201d: bodies maintain a state of\nrectilinear motion until acted upon by an external cause. Thus their\nfundamental conception of force, as the power of a body to change the\nstate of another, likewise depended on this notion of a privileged\nstate. This dependence was clearly exhibited in the vortex theory of\nplanetary motion, which presupposed that any planet would move in a\nstraight line unless impeded. Its actual orbit was therefore explained\nby the balance between the planet\u2019s inherent centrifugal\ntendency (its tendency to follow the tangent to the orbit) and the\npressure of the surrounding medium.\n\nFor this reason, the notion of a dispute between\n\u201crelativists\u201d or \u201crelationists\u201d and\n\u201cabsolutists\u201d or \u201csubstantivalists\u201d, in the\n17th century, is a drastic oversimplification. Newton, in\nhis controversial Scholium on space, time, and motion, was not merely\nasserting that motion is absolute in the face of the mechanists\u2019\nrelativist view. He was arguing that a conception of absolute motion\nwas already implicit in the views of his opponents\u2014that it was\nimplicit in their conception, which he largely shared, of physical\ncause and effect. The general equivalence of reference-frames was\nimplicitly denied by a physics that characterized forces as powers to\nchange the states of motion of bodies.\n\nThis development placed the subject of reference frames in a new\ntheoretical context. Having set aside the reference frame of common\nsense\u2014the frame in which the earth is at rest in the center,\nwith the heavens revolving around it\u2014the mechanical physics of\nthis time naturally tied this subject with novel theoretical\nconceptions of motion, and its physical causes and effects. Copernicus\nargued for a heliocentric system, not from a physical theory of\nmotion, but from the comparative simplicity and reasonableness that it\nintroduced into astronomy; he worked within the established theory of\nthe causes of celestial motions, namely, the revolutions of the\nheavenly spheres. After Copernicus, however\u2014more precisely,\nafter the model of revolving spheres was largely\nabandoned\u2014determining the right frame of reference was connected\nwith discovering the true physical causes of the planets\u2019\nmotions. Philosophers such as Kepler, Descartes, Huygens, Leibniz, and\nNewton held vastly differing views of physical causation, motion. and\nthe relativity of motion. They agreed, however, that the heliocentric\npicture was uniquely suited for giving a causal account of planetary\nmotions, as the effects of physical actions originating in the sun. To\nKepler and Descartes, for example, the rotation of the sun on its\naxis, in the same sense in which the planets revolved, identified it\nas the cause of those revolutions.\n\nThe link between the causal account of motion and the more general\nconceptual account of \u201ctrue\u201d motion was never obvious or\nstraightforward. Descartes\u2019s heliocentric causal account, in\nwhich the planets moved in vortices arising from the sun\u2019s\nrotation, was disconnected from his abstract account of motion\n\u201caccording to the truth of the matter,\u201d or \u201cin the\nproper sense\u201d (Descartes 1642, part II section XXV). Since there\nare innumerable objects to which one might refer the motion of any\ngiven body, the reference may appear to be a matter of arbitrary\nchoice. The unambiguous reference for the motion of any body, he\nargued, is provided by the bodies immediately touching it. Newton, in\nresponse, argued that Descartes\u2019s philosophical account of\nmotion is flatly incompatible with his causal account. To Newton, it\nwas incoherent to appeal to a causal account of motion when explaining\nthe centrifugal tendency of a body in its orbit around the sun, while\nidentifying its \u201cproper\u201d motion only by its relations to\nthe bodies immediately contiguous to it (Newton 1684a, Stein 1967,\nRynasiewicz 2014). Hence Newton\u2019s argument that the only\nunambiguous standard of motion is a body\u2019s change of position\nwith respect to space itself. To space understood in this sense, as\nthe universal frame of reference with respect to which the\ndisplacements of bodies constitute their true motions, Newton gave the\nname \u201cabsolute space\u201d (1687b, p. 5ff). \n\nEvidently Newton was aware that \u201cabsolute space\u201d was not a\nreference frame in any practical sense. He emphasized that \u201cthe\nparts of space cannot be seen,\u201d and that no observable bodies\ncan be known to be at rest. Hence there is no way to determine motion\nwith respect to space by direct observation; it must be known by its\n\u201cproperties, causes, and effects\u201d (1687b, p. 7\u20138).\nThe question arises, then, what properties, causes, or effects\nindicate a body\u2019s change of position in absolute space? It is\nconceivable, for example, that there might be some physical correlate\nfor velocity, in the sense that a body might have some observable\nphysical state that depends on its velocity. It follows, in that case,\nthat a body would be in a distinct physical state when it is at rest\nin space. If a body could be known to be in that state, therefore, it\nwould (in principle) provide a physical marker for a truly resting\nframe of reference. On Leibniz\u2019s conception of force, for\ninstance, a given force is required to generate or to maintain a given\nvelocity. For objects \u201cpassively\u201d resist motion, but\nmaintain their states of motion only by \u201cactive\u201d\nforce\u2014so that, on dynamical grounds, \u201cevery body truly\ndoes have a certain amount of motion, or, if you will, force\u201d\n(Leibniz 1694, p. 184; see also 1716, p. 404). It would follow from\nthis that there must be, in principle, a distinguished frame of\nreference in which the velocities of bodies correspond to their true\nvelocities, i.e. to the amounts of moving force that they truly\npossess. It would also follow that, with respect to any frame that is\nin motion relative to this one, bodies will not have their true\nvelocities. In short, such a conception of force, if it could be\napplied physically, would give a precise physical application of\nNewton\u2019s conception of absolute space, by providing a physical\ncorrelate for change of absolute place. \n",
