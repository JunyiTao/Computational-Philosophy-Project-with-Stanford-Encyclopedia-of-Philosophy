    "main_text": "Works\n2. Works\n\nBessarion\u2019s opera omnia include writings prepared for\naudiences in both the Byzantine and the Roman courts, such as orations\nand pieces of poetry. Of particular interest are the orations he\naddressed to Italian rulers, in order to convince them to join a\ncrusade against the Turks (the Orationes ad principes Italiae\ncontra Turcos, 1470). The De errore Paschatis, devoted\nto calculating the proper date of Easter, was probably composed with\nthe assistance of Regiomontanus (1436\u20131476) and reflects\nBessarion\u2019s early interest in astronomy, which he had cultivated\nsince the time of his training under Cortasmenos and Pletho. Bessarion\nalso left behind a rich corpus of letters which he had never edited for\npublication. In addition to being the patron of important translations, he\nalso himself translated Greek works into Latin, including Saint\nBasil\u2019s De nativitate Domini, Xenophon\u2019s\nMemorabilia, and Demosthenes\u2019 First Olinthiac.\nHowever, Bessarion\u2019s most important works, both as an\nauthor and as a translator, are focused on theology and\nphilosophy.\n",
