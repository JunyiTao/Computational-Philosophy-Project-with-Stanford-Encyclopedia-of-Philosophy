    "main_text": "Williams and Moral Philosophy\n2. Williams and Moral Philosophy\n\nIn the Preface to Williams\u2019 first book he notes the charge\nagainst contemporary moral philosophy \u201cthat it is peculiarly\nempty and boring\u201d.\n [1].\n Moral philosophy, he claims, has found an original way of being\nboring: and this is \u201cby not discussing moral issues at\nall.\u201d\n\nCertainly, this charge is no longer as fair now as it was in 1972.\nToday there is an entire discipline called \u201capplied\u201d or\n\u201cpractical\u201d ethics, not to mention sub-disciplines called\nenvironmental, business, sport, media, healthcare, and medical ethics,\nto the extent that hardly any moral issues are not discussed\nby philosophers nowadays. However, while some or even many\nphilosophers today do applied ethics by applying some general,\nabstract theory, a problem with many of them, as Williams pointed out\nin an interview in 1983, is that those who proceed in this way often\nseem to lose any real interest in the perspectives of the human beings\nwho must actually live with a moral problem:\n\nI do think it is perfectly proper for some philosophers all of the\ntime and for other philosophers some of the time to be engaged in\ntechnical issues, without having to worry all the time whether their\nwork is going to revolutionise our view of the employment situation,\nor something of that kind. Indeed, without criticising any particular\nthinkers or publicists, a problem with \u201capplied ethics\u201d is\nthat some people have a bit of ready-made philosophical theory, and\nthey whiz in, a bit like hospital auxiliary personnel who aren\u2019t\nactually doctors. That kind of applied philosophy isn\u2019t even\n half-interesting\u2026[2]\n\n\nHe continues:\n\n\u2026the temptation is to find a way to apply philosophy to\nimmediate and practical problems and to do so by arguing about those\nproblems in a legalistic way. You are tempted to make your moral\nphilosophy course into a quasi-legal course\u2026 All the\nphilosophical journals are full of issues about women\u2019s rights,\nabortion, social justice, and so on. But an awful lot of it consists\nof what can be called in the purely technical sense a kind of\ncasuistry, an application of certain moral systems or principles or\ntheories to discussing what we should think about abortion.\n\n\nWe are now able to see how Williams conceived of the relation between\nphilosophy and lived ethical experience. He firmly believed that\nphilosophy should speak to that experience, on pain of being\n\u201cempty and boring\u201d. But he did not think that we should\nfollow the moral philosophers of his day in preferring the schematic\nover the detailed, or the general over the particular. Here, Williams\njoins a long critical tradition that stretches at least back to G.W.F.\nHegel, whose own claim that Kant\u2019s moral theory was\n\u201cempty\u201d is importantly related to Williams\u2019 own\ncharge against moral theorizing. Moreover, as a general criticism of\nmoral philosophy, this point arguably remains quite correct even\n today.[3]\n Bearing this general orientation in mind, we now turn to a discussion\nof Williams\u2019 more determinate charges against various types of\nmoral theory.\n",
