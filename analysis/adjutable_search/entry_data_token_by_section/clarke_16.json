    "main_text": "Ethics\n6. Influence and Reception\n\nClarke\u2019s influence on his contemporaries and the generation that\nfollowed was immense. One important aspect of his immediate influence\nwas that as the translator of the standard textbook in physics in\nEngland in the early eighteenth century, as the defender of absolute\nspace and atomism in the correspondence with Leibniz, as the\ntranslator of Newton\u2019s Opticks into Latin, and as a\nrecognized close friend of Newton, Clarke was perhaps the most\nsignificant spokesperson for the Newtonian natural philosophy, and a\nprimary interpreter of its implications for metaphysics, philosophy of\nscience, and theology. In particular, his use of the passivity and\nscarcity of matter in his argument for the existence of God was noted\nby his contemporaries internationally.\n\nClarke\u2019s influence was greatest in England and Scotland, where\nall of his works were widely read. (Although his Boyle lectures went\nthrough ten editions in thirty years, Dahm [1970, 176] finds only one\ntranslation during that time, into French.) Daniel Waterland was his\nsharpest contemporary critic, but the two remained friendly throughout\n(Ferguson 1976, 217). A. A. Sykes and John Jackson were Clarke\u2019s\nmost forceful defenders in the 1710s and 1720s. Clarke often made\nsuggestions to Jackson about how best to defend his views (Ferguson\n1976, 218\u2013219). Among those sympathetic to Clarke\u2019s methodology\nand positions in the next two generations, Andrew Baxter was the most\npolemical, John Stewart the most irritating to Hume, Richard Price the\nmost similar, and Thomas Reid the most well known today.\nClarke\u2019s ethics (with some metaphysical support) were defended\nby William Wollaston and Catharine Trotter Cockburn (see Thomas 2017,\n210ff), supplemented by Joseph Butler, and attacked by David Hume (see\nGreenberg 2013, 251ff).\n\nHume clearly has Clarke in mind in his Dialogues Concerning\nNatural Religion, where Demea recites the argument a\npriori and both Cleanthes and Philo offer critiques. Furthermore,\nClarke is cited by name in Treatise 1.3.3 and is a likely\nobject of the arguments against ethical rationalism in\nTreatise 3.1. In A Letter from a Gentleman (1745),\nHume admits that Clarke\u2019s argument a priori is\nundermined by the claims of the Treatise. Russell (1997 and\n2008) has proposed that Clarke is a major target of Hume\u2019s\nTreatise, and that Hume\u2019s opposition to natural\ntheology as defended by Clarke is a uniting theme of the\nTreatise.\n\nClarke profoundly influenced philosophers in the eighteenth century\nthat had interests in the intersection of theology and philosophy,\nparticularly on the freedom of the will and the relationship between\nGod, space, and matter. Jonathan Edwards singled out Clarke as a major\nopponent in his Freedom of the Will, where Edwards runs\ntogether libertarianism with Arminian theology. That same\nlibertarianism made Clarke popular among the German Pietists. Among\nthem, Crusius is the most notable, both for his work and for his\nimportance to Kant, and the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence is a likely\nsource for Kant\u2019s discussions of space and time. Voltaire (1752)\ndeclared, \u201cAmong these philosophers [the last generation of\nBritish philosophers], Clarke is perhaps altogether the clearest, the\nmost profound, the most methodical, and the strongest of all those who\nhave spoken of the Supreme Being.\u201d Voltaire as a young man was\nparticularly impressed with Clarke; later in life, he seems to have\nbeen less convinced by Clarke\u2019s argument for the existence of\nGod. In Emile, Rousseau refers to \u201cthe illustrious\nClarke enlightening the world, proclaiming at last the Being of beings\nand the Dispenser of things,\u201d but whether Rousseau was\nsteadfastly sympathetic to Clarke\u2019s system is in doubt (Attfield\n2004, 433\u2013434).\n\nClarke\u2019s influence waned late in the eighteenth century. In\n1778, Richard Price could still write on behalf of many that\n\u201cDr. Clarke is, without all doubt, the best and ablest of all\nwriters, on the subjects of the Immateriality and Natural Immortality\nof the Soul, and also on Liberty and Necessity,\u201d but by the\nnineteenth century interest in and appreciation of Clarke had\ndwindled. Samuel Coleridge (1854, 405) considered him\n\u201cover-rated,\u201d and Leslie Stephen (1881, 119) claimed that\nto nineteenth-century eyes, Clarke \u201cappears to be a second-rate\nadvocate of opinions interesting only in the mouths of greater men who\nwere their first and ablest advocates.\u201d Henry Sidgwick (1886,\n175\u2013180), despite his criticisms, is a nineteenth-century exception in\nholding Clarke in high regard.\n\nIn the last few decades, a renewed interest in Clarke\u2019s argument\na priori, a rediscovery of Newton\u2019s unpublished writings\nand subsequent study of his associates, and a greater appreciation for\nClarke\u2019s historical importance to ethics, metaphysics, and more have\nphilosophers reading Clarke again, and the estimation of his\nphilosophical acuity has increased.\n",
