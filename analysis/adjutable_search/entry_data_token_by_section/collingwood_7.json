    "main_text": "History and Science || The historical past and the presuppositions of historical inquiry\n3.1 The historical past and the presuppositions of historical inquiry\n\nAn Essay on Metaphysics contains a general statement of\nCollingwood\u2019s metaphilosophy and his view that metaphysics is\nnot an ontological inquiry into pure being but a logical inquiry that\ntakes the form of presuppositional analysis. While An Essay on\nMetaphysics explained, in the most general terms, what\npresuppositional analysis is, The Idea of History (1946) and\nThe Principles of History (1999) seek to uncover the\npresuppositions governing historical inquiry into the past.\nCollingwood\u2019s philosophy of history asks the question:\n\u201cwhat are the presuppositions that govern the historical\nunderstanding of the past?\u201d and \u201cwhat does it mean to\nunderstand the past historically?\u201d The nature of\nCollingwood\u2019s concern with the past is not metaphysical. He is\nnot advancing a theory concerning the nature of time, whether, for\nexample, it is ever-present or a growing block. Nor is it primarily an\nepistemological concern with the question of how one acquires\nknowledge of the past, given that it is not available for observation,\nalthough he does address some epistemological questions. The nature of\nhis concern with the nature of the past is first and foremost a\nconceptual concern with the question \u201cWhat is the historical\npast? What does it mean to understand the past\nhistorically?\u201d\n\nThe historical past is the past understood\nhistorically, i.e., from the perspective of certain\npresuppositions, presuppositions that give rise to certain kinds of\nquestions, questions that are distinctive of historical inquiry and\ndiffer from those of natural science. The past in so far as it is\nunderstood historically (the historical past) is therefore\nnot the same thing as the past as it is studied by a natural\nscientist. Just as the term \u201ccause\u201d needs to be\ndisambiguated to avoid conceptual confusion, so does the term\n\u201cpast\u201d because it means different things to the\nhumanistically oriented historiographer as it does, for example, to a\ngeologist:\n\n\nThere is a certain analogy between the archaeologist\u2019s\ninterpretation of a stratified site and a geologist\u2019s\ninterpretation of rock-horizons with their associated fossils; but the\ndifference is no less clear than the similarity. The\narchaeologist\u2019s use of his stratified relics depends on his\nconceiving them as artifacts serving human purposes and thus\nexpressing a particular way in which men have thought of their own\nlife; and from his point of view the palaeontologist, arranging his\nfossils in a time-series, is not working as an historian, but only as\na scientist thinking in a way which can at most be described as\nquasi-historical. (IH 1993: 212)\n\n\nWhile both the geologist and the historian are concerned with the\npast, the questions that they ask and the presuppositions which give\nrise to those questions are different. Scientific inquiry rests on the\npresupposition of the uniformity of nature. This principle is required\nto formulate the inductive hypotheses which enable empirical\nscientists to predict what will happen in the future and retrodict\nwhat happened in the past. Empirically minded scientists presuppose\nthat everything that happens is subject to natural laws which are\ninvariant over time, for example, that water freezes at 0\u00b0 Celsius\nunder the reign of Queen Victoria as well as the time of Henry VIII.\nBut while this presupposition is well suited to serve the explanatory\ngoals of natural science, it is of limited use to historians who are\nconcerned not with what is invariant throughout history, but with what\nis distinctive about different periods of time. It would not help an\nEgyptologist to understand the rituals of the ancient Egyptian to\nascribe them the mindset of a medieval feudal baron. As Collingwood\nputs it:\n\n\nTypes of behaviour do, no doubt, recur, so long as minds of the same\nkind are placed in the same kind of situations. The behaviour-patterns\ncharacteristic of a feudal baron were no doubt fairly constant so long\nas there were feudal barons living in a feudal society. But they will\nbe sought in vain (except by an inquirer content with the loosest and\nmost fanciful analogies) in a world whose social structure is of\nanother kind. In order that behaviour-patterns may be constant, there\nmust be in existence a social order which recurrently produces\nsituations of a certain kind. But social orders are historical facts,\nand subject to inevitable change, fast or slow. A positive science of\nmind will, no doubt, be able to establish uniformities and\nrecurrences, but it can have no guarantee that the laws it establishes\nwill hold good beyond the historical period from which its facts are\ndrawn. (IH 1993: 223\u2013224)\n\n\nCollingwood is critical of those philosophers who, like Bradley\n(1874), bring the presuppositions of natural science to bear upon the\nstudy of the historical past. It is not the role of\nhistorians to dismiss as false the testimony of historical agents who\nattest to the occurrence of miracles on the grounds that since nature\nis uniform and its laws do not change, the miracles past agents\nattested to could not have happened because their occurrence\ncontravenes the laws of nature. This \u201cpositivistic spirit\u201d\n(IH 1993: 135\u201336) encourages a judgmental attitude towards the\nhistorical sources rather than an attempt to understand their meaning.\nThis is not to say that historians need to believe that miracles\nhappened in order to understand the sources, but rather that\nunderstanding the role that belief in the supernatural had for the\nagents who witnessed to them is more important for the historian than\nassessing whether belief in the supernatural is true or false:\n\n\nIf the reasons why it is hard for a man to cross the mountains is\nbecause he is frightened of the devils in them, it is folly for the\nhistorian, preaching at him across a gulf of centuries, to say\n\u201cThis is sheer superstition, there are no devils at all. Face\nfacts, and realize there are no dangers in the mountains except rocks\nand water and snow, wolves perhaps, and bad men perhaps, but no\ndevils.\u201d The historian says that these are the facts because\nthat is the way in which he has been taught to think. But the\ndevil-fearer says that the presence of devils is a fact, because that\nis the way in which he has been taught to think. The historian thinks\nit a wrong way; but wrong ways of thinking are just as much historical\nfacts as right ones, and, no less than they, determine the situation\n(always a thought-situation) in which the man who shares them is\nplaced. (IH 1993: 317)\n\n\nThe important question concerning any statement contained in an\nhistorical source \u201cis not whether it is true or false, but what\nit means\u201d (IH 1993: 260). Ignoring this advice leads to writing\n\u201cscissors-and-paste\u201d histories where the sources are\ntreated as worthwhile historical material and admitted into the\nhistorian\u2019s narrative only if they are deemed to be believable\nby the historian\u2019s own standards of evidence. To understand the\npast historically is to understand the \u201ccontext of\nthought\u201d (IH 1993: 299) of past agents, their frame of\nmind. What makes an investigation historical, therefore, is\nnot simply the fact that it is focused on the past, but the kind of\nconcerns by which it is guided when investigating the past. To\nunderstand past agents is to understand the way in which they\nreasoned, the inferences that they drew, the conceptual connections\nwhich they made, the symbolic significance they attached to certain\nevents. Understanding a past occurrence, such as Caesar\u2019s\ncrossing of the Rubicon historically, for example, is to understand\nthe significance that it had for a contemporary Roman who knew what\nRoman law permitted and proscribed. This is what differentiates a\nconcern with the historical past from a concern with the natural\npast:\n\n\nThe historian, investigating an event in the past, makes a distinction\nbetween what may be called the outside and the inside of an event. By\nthe outside of the event I mean everything belonging to it which can\nbe described in terms of bodies and their movements: the passage of\nCaesar, accompanied by certain men, across a river called the Rubicon\nat one date, or the spilling of his blood across the floor of the\nsenate-house at another. By the inside of the event I mean that in it\nwhich can only be described in terms of thought: Caesar\u2019s\ndefiance of Republican law, or the clash of constitutional policy\nbetween himself and his assassins. The historian is never concerned\nwith either of these to the exclusion of the other. He is\ninvestigating not mere events (where by a mere event I mean one which\nhas only an outside and no inside) but actions, and an action is the\nunity of the outside and the inside of an event. He is interested in\nthe crossing of the Rubicon only in its relation to Republican law,\nand in the spilling of Caesar\u2019s blood only in relation to a\nconstitutional conflict. (IH 1993: 213)\n\n\nTo understand Caesar\u2019s crossing of the Rubicon against the\nbackground of Republican law is to understand the crossing as\ntransgressing not a law of nature (natural laws apply uniformly to the\npresent, past, and future), but a military norm which banned armed\ngenerals from crossing a border (norms, unlike natural laws, change\nfrom time to time). Understanding actions historically requires\nunderstanding them more like responses to commands that may be\nfollowed or disregarded, than as instances (or counter instances) of\nempirical laws. When understood historically, therefore, the actions\nof past agents are explained more in the manner in which one\nunderstands the action of a motorist who stops at a traffic light\n(i.e., as abiding by a traffic regulation) than they are in the way in\nwhich an astronomer retrodicts the death of a star. The mindset of\npast agents cannot be investigated under the presupposition which\ngoverns empirical science, i.e., the uniformity of nature, because the\nstudy of mind, is a \u201cnormative or criteriological enquiry\u201d\n(PA: 171, footnote).\n\nThe distinction between the historical past and the natural past\ncorresponds to the distinction between the subject matters of the\nsciences of mind and nature: the former study actions, in so far as\nthey explain what happens as an expression of thought, the latter\nstudy events insofar as they approach their subject matter as\ninstantiating certain observable patterns. As such\n\u201cactions\u201d and \u201cevents\u201d are the correlatives of\ndifferent kinds inferences. Collingwood captured the distinction\nbetween actions and events by claiming that the former have an inside\nwhich the latter lack (IH 1993: 118). The point of this claim was to\ndraw attention to the fact that the meaning or significance of an\naction eludes nomological explanations which account for what happens\nby subsuming their explanandum under general laws. A historian might,\nfor example, observe certain empirical regularities (in the past every\ntime that white smoke emanated from the Sistine chapel in Rome, large\ncrowds of people cheered), without understanding \u201cwhy\u201d in\na particular sense of \u201cwhy\u201d the crowds cheered. If a\nsocial scientist suggested that the crowds cheered because\nwhite smoke emanated from the Sistine Chapel, this kind of\n\u201cbecause\u201d would singularly fail to address the question\nthat the historian wants answered. The kind of explanation that would\nsatisfy the curiosity of the historian is one which states something\nalong the lines of \u201cthe crowds cheered because a new pope was\nelected\u201d but such an explanation would not be possible without\ninvoking the \u201ccontext of thought\u201d within which alone one\ncan understand the symbolic significance of the white smoke. Words\nlike \u201ccause\u201d or \u201cbecause\u201d, Collingwood claims,\nare not necessarily\n\n\nout of place in reference to history; it only means that they are used\nthere in a special sense. When a scientist asks: \u201cWhy did that\npiece of litmus paper turn pink?\u201d he means \u201cOn what kinds\nof occasions do pieces of litmus paper turn pink?\u201d When an\nhistorian asks \u201cWhy did Brutus stab Caesar?\u201d he means\n\u201cWhat did Brutus think, which made him decide to stab\nCaesar?\u201d The cause of the event, for him, means the thought in\nthe mind of the person by whose agency the event came about: and this\nis not something other than the event, it is the inside of the event\nitself. (IH 1993: 214\u2013215)\n\n\nThe inside/outside distinction that Collingwood often invokes to\nexplicate the differences between the subject matters of history and\nscience is a highly metaphorical way of defending a commitment to\nexplanatory pluralism and the irreducibility of historical to\nscientific explanations. This metaphor has unfortunately sometimes\nbeen read literally, leading to Collingwood being unfairly attacked\nfor defending the view that the subject matter of history is an\ninternal, unobservable psychological process and for putting forward\nan equally implausible method for accessing it: re-enactment.\n",
