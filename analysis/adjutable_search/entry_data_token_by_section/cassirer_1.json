    "main_text": "Early Historical Writings\n2. Early Historical Writings\n\nAs indicated above, Cassirer\u2019s first writings were largely\nhistorical in character \u2013 including a discussion of\nLeibniz\u2019s philosophy in its scientific context [Cassirer 1902]\nand a large-scale work on the history of modern thought from the\nRenaissance through Kant, Das Erkenntnisproblem in der Philosophie\nund Wissenschaft der neueren Zeit [Cassirer 1906, 1907a]. The\nlatter, in particular, is a magisterial and deeply original\ncontribution to both the history of philosophy and the history of\nscience. It is the first work, in fact, to develop a detailed reading\nof the scientific revolution as a whole in terms of the\n\u201cPlatonic\u201d idea that the thoroughgoing application of\nmathematics to nature (the so-called mathematization of nature) is the\ncentral and overarching achievement of this revolution. And\nCassirer\u2019s insight was explicitly acknowledged by such seminal\nintellectual historians as E. A. Burtt, E. J. Dijksterhuis, and\nAlexandre Koyr\u00e9, who developed this theme later in the century\nin the course of establishing the discipline of history of science as\nwe know it today (see, e.g., [Burtt 1925], [Koyr\u00e9 1939],\n[Dijksterhuis 1959]). Cassirer, for his part, simultaneously\narticulates an interpretation of the history of modern philosophy as\nthe development and eventual triumph of what he calls \u201cmodern\nphilosophical idealism.\u201d This tradition takes its inspiration,\naccording to Cassirer, from idealism in the Platonic sense, from an\nappreciation for the \u201cideal\u201d formal structures\nparadigmatically studied in mathematics, and it is distinctively\nmodern in recognizing the fundamental importance of the systematic\napplication of such structures to empirically given nature in modern\nmathematical physics \u2013 a progressive and synthetic process\nwherein mathematical models of nature are successively refined and\ncorrected without limit. For Cassirer, it is Galileo, above all, in\nopposition to both sterile Aristotelian-Scholastic formal logic and\nsterile Aristotelian-Scholastic empirical induction, who first grasped\nthe essential structure of this synthetic process; and the development\nof \u201cmodern philosophical idealism\u201d by such thinkers as\nDescartes, Spinoza, Gassendi, Hobbes, Leibniz, and Kant then consists\nin its increasingly self-conscious philosophical articulation and\nelaboration.\n\nIn both the Leibniz book and Das Erkenntnisproblem, then,\nCassirer interprets the development of modern thought as a whole from\nthe perspective of the basic philosophical principles of Marburg\nneo-Kantianism: the idea that philosophy as epistemology\n(Erkenntniskritik) has the articulation and elaboration of\nthe structure of modern mathematical natural science as its primary\ntask; the conviction that, accordingly, philosophy must take the\n\u201cfact of science\u201d as its starting point and ultimately\ngiven datum; and, most especially, the so-called \u201cgenetic\u201d\nconception of scientific knowledge as an ongoing, never completed\nsynthetic process (see below). From a contemporary point of view,\nCassirer\u2019s history may therefore appear as both\n\u201cWhiggish\u201d and \u201ctriumphalist,\u201d but it cannot\nbe denied that his work is, nevertheless, extraordinarily rich,\nextraordinarily clear, and extraordinarily illuminating. Cassirer\nexamines an astonishing variety of textual sources (including both\nmajor and minor figures) carefully and in detail, and, without at all\nneglecting contrary tendencies within the skeptical and empiricist\ntraditions, he develops a compelling portrayal of the evolution of\n\u201cmodern philosophical idealism\u201d through Kant which, even\ntoday, reads as extremely compelling and acute.\n\nCassirer must thus be ranked as one of the very greatest intellectual\nhistorians of the twentieth-century \u2013 and, indeed, as one of the\nfounders of this discipline as it came to be practiced after 1900. He\ncontinued to contribute to intellectual history broadly conceived\nthroughout his career (most notably, perhaps, in his fundamental\nstudies of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment [Cassirer 1927a,\n1932]), and he had a major influence on intellectual history\nthroughout the century. Aside from the history of science (see above),\nCassirer also decisively influenced intellectual historians more\ngenerally, including, notably, the eminent intellectual and cultural\nhistorian Peter Gay and the distinguished art historian Erwin Panofsky\n(see, e.g., [Gay 1977], [Panofsky 1939]). As we shall see below,\nintellectual (and later cultural) history is an integral part of\nCassirer\u2019s distinctive philosophical methodology, so that, in\nhis case, the standard distinction between \u201chistorical\u201d\nand \u201csystematic\u201d work in philosophy ends up looking quite\nartificial.\n",
