    "main_text": "From Languages of Art to Reconceptions: New Looks at Aesthetic Issues || Authenticity\n4.4 Authenticity\n\nAn issue closely related to the ontological question of the identity\nof the work of art in the various art forms\u2014indeed the very\nissue that Goodman uses, in Languages of Art, to introduce\nhis theory of notation\u2014is that of the importance of\nauthenticity in art and of the aesthetic relevance of being a\nforgery. (Goodman\u2019s comments on the question of forgery prompted\na small debate on that issue, mostly represented in a collection\nedited by Denis Dutton [1983].) The brief answer is that authenticity\nmatters only where there is no notationality. Hence, for instance, it\nmakes no difference whether a musical piece is performed from the\noriginal score or from a copy congruent with that, since the score is\nin a notational scheme. Yet it does matter whether one is presented\nwith an original Rembrandt or with a copy of it, since paintings are\nanalogs, symbols in syntactically dense systems.\n\nWith regard to two visually indiscernible paintings, an original and a\ncopy, Goodman addresses the question whether there is any aesthetic\ndifference between the two pictures (1976, 99\u2013102). Notice that,\nif there is a difference, it must not depend on what one can visually\ndiscern at the present time, for ex hypothesis, there is no\nsuch visual difference that can currently be detected. Goodman\u2019s\nanswer is that there is an aesthetic difference between the two\npaintings even now, when we are unable to tell one painting from the\nother, for an awareness that one is the original and the other a copy\ninforms us that a difference may be perceived, and indeed modifies our\npresent perception of the two paintings: now, for instance,\nwe look for differences between the two paintings, we train\nour eyes and minds to discriminate differences that are currently\nindiscernible (1976, 103\u2013105). Goodman\u2019s takes his claims\nto be general and as granting the conclusion that \u201cthe aesthetic\nproperties of a picture include not only those found by looking at it\nbut also those the determine how it is to be looked at\u201d (1976,\n111\u2013112). Hence, even with pictures that are not\n\u201cperfect\u201d copies of other pictures, indeed with\nany picture, knowing how it should be\nclassified\u2014including its classification by authorship, as a\nRembrandt, a Vermeer, or a Van Meegeren\u2014makes a difference to\nhow the picture may be perceived. For perceiving is, after all,\ndetermined by the labels that one projects over what is presented in\nfront of one\u2019s eyes. It must be noticed, then, that this claim\nis all within a theory of perception and, while claiming that\nnon-perceptible features are relevant to perception, hence are\nrelevant to aesthetic experience, it does not claim that\nnon-perceptible features as such are relevant to aesthetic\nexperience.\n",
