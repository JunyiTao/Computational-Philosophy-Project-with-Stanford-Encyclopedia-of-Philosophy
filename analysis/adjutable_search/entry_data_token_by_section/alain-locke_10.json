    "main_text": "Aesthetics\n5. Aesthetics\n\nLocke is perhaps best known for his work in aesthetics, in particular,\nhis role as both an intellectual purveyor of Negro art and literary\ncritic. Locke managed to position himself at the forefront of one of\nthe most significant and important artistic rebirths in American\nhistory. His seminal work, The New Negro, was ground-breaking\nin its presentation of Negro art as thoroughly self-expressive of the\nindividual artist, and not as merely representative of aesthetic,\ncultural and social possibilities. Locke's publication of The New\nNegro was in many ways in direct defiance and contradiction of\nthe black intellectual elite of his day, most notably W. E. B. Du\nBois, as well as being the advance guard of the aesthetic sentiments\nof the average Negro of his day. There is evidence of his\nphilosophical views, especially in the areas of axiology, culture,\nrace and ethnicity throughout his writings on aesthetics. Major themes\nin Locke's aesthetics include: universal human appeal and the\nrelationship of universal and particular; the transition from folk art\nto high art; the centrality of individual expressivity; and\ncross-cultural communicability through the aesthetic.\n",
