    "main_text": "Proof Theory and Semantics of Constructive and Intuitionistic ZF || .4 Categorical models of constructive and intuitionistic set theory\n5.4 Variants of Constructive and Intuitionistic Set Theories: Set Theories with Urelements and Non-extensional Set Theories\n\n\nSometimes systems of intuitionistic and constructive set theory have\nbeen presented with the natural numbers as a separate sort of\nurelements, that is, primitive objects with no elements (Friedman 1977; \nMyhill 1975; Beeson 1985). Constructively, this is a\nnatural choice which is in agreement with ideas expressed, for example, by\nBishop (1967) (among others). In Bishop\u2019s monograph the natural\nnumbers are taken as a fundamental concept on which all the\nother mathematical concepts are based. From a technical\npoint of view, if the natural numbers are taken as primitive and\ndistinct from their set-theoretic representations, the axiom of\ninfinity then takes the form: \u201cthere is a set of natural numbers\n(as urelements)\u201d. A more general form of urelements in\nconstructive set theories have been considered in (Cantini and Crosilla\n2008). Here a variant of constructive set theory is proposed which combines \nan intensional and partial notion of operation with CZF\u2019s extensional notion of set \n(see also Cantini and Crosilla 2010).\n\n\nThe axiom of extensionality is a common feature of all the systems\ndiscussed so far. However, in a context in which the computational\ncontent of a statement is considered to be crucial, an intensional\ntheory might be more appropriate. For example, constructive type theory and\nexplicit mathematics both encapsulate some form of\nintensionality. Intuitionistic set theories without extensionality\nhave been considered in the literature (Friedman 1973a, Beeson 1985). \nTheir motivation, however, has been not computational\nbut technical in nature, due to the difficulties that extensionality \nbrings about when studying metamathematical properties of intuitionistic set \ntheories. \n",
