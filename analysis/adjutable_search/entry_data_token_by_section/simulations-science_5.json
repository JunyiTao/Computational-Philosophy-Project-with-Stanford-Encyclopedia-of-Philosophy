    "main_text": "Types of Computer Simulations || Multiscale Simulations\n2.3 Multiscale Simulations\n\n\nIn section 2.1 we discussed equation-based models that are based on\nparticle methods and those that are based on field methods. \nBut some simulation models are hybrids of different kinds of modeling\nmethods. Multiscale simulation models, in particular,\ncouple together modeling elements from different scales of\ndescription. A good example of this would be a model that\nsimulates the dynamics of bulk matter by treating the material as a\nfield undergoing stress and strain at a relatively coarse level of\ndescription, but which zooms into particular regions of the material\nwhere important small scale effects are taking place, and models those\nsmaller regions with relatively more fine-grained modeling methods.\nSuch methods might rely on molecular dynamics, or quantum mechanics, or\nboth\u2014each of which is a more fine-grained description of matter\nthan is offered by treating the material as a field. Multiscale\nsimulation methods can be further broken down into serial multiscale\nand parallel multiscale methods. The more traditional\nmethod is serial multi-scale modeling. The idea here is to\nchoose a region, simulate it at the lower level of description,\nsummarize the results into a set of parameters digestible by the higher\nlevel model, and pass them up to into the part of the algorithm\ncalculating at the higher level.\n\n\nSerial multiscale methods are not effective when the different scales\nare strongly coupled together. When the different scales interact\nstrongly to produce the observed behavior, what is required is an\napproach that simulates each region simultaneously. This is called\nparallel multiscale modeling. Parallel multiscale modeling is the\nfoundation of a nearly ubiquitous simulation method: so called\n\u201csub-grid\u201d modeling. Sub-grid modeling refers to the\nrepresentation of important small-scale physical processes that occur\nat length-scales that cannot be adequately resolved on the grid size\nof a particular simulation. (Remember that many simulations discretize\ncontinuous equations, so they have a relatively arbitrary finite\n\u201cgrid size.\u201d) In the study of turbulence in fluids, for\nexample, a common practical strategy for calculation is to account for\nthe missing small-scale vortices (or eddies) that\nfall inside the grid cells. This is done by adding to the large-scale\nmotion an eddy viscosity that characterizes the transport and\ndissipation of energy in the smaller-scale flow\u2014or any such\nfeature that occurs at too small a scale to be captured by the\ngrid.\n\n\nIn climate science and kindred disciplines, sub-grid modeling is\ncalled \u201cparameterization.\u201d This, again, refers to the\nmethod of replacing processes\u2014ones that are too small-scale or\ncomplex to be physically represented in the model\u2014 by a more\nsimple mathematical description. This is as opposed to other\nprocesses\u2014e.g., large-scale flow of the atmosphere\u2014that are\ncalculated at the grid level in accordance with the basic theory. It is\ncalled \u201cparameterization\u201d because various non-physical\nparameters are needed to drive the highly approximative\nalgorithms that compute the sub-grid values. Examples of\nparameterization in climate simulations include the descent rate of\nraindrops, the rate of atmospheric radiative transfer, and the rate of\ncloud formation. For example, the average cloudiness over a 100\nkm2 grid box is not cleanly related to the average humidity\nover the box. Nonetheless, as the average humidity increases, average\ncloudiness will also increase\u2014hence there could be a parameter linking\naverage cloudiness to average humidity inside a grid box. Even\nthough modern-day parameterizations of cloud formation are more\nsophisticated than this, the basic idea is well illustrated by the\nexample. The use of\nsub-grid modeling methods in simulation has important consequences for\nunderstanding the structure of the epistemology of\nsimulation. This will be discussed in greater detail in\nsection 4.\n\n\nSub-grid modelling methods can be contrasted with another kind of\nparallel multiscale model where the sub-grid algorithms are more\ntheoretically principled, but are motivated by a theory at a different\nlevel of description. In the example of the simulation of bulk matter\nmentioned above, for example, the algorithm driving the smaller level\nof description is not built by the seat-of-the-pants. The algorithm\ndriving the smaller level is actually more theoretically principled\nthan the higher level in the sense that the physics is more\nfundamental: quantum mechanics or molecular dynamics vs. continuum\nmechanics. These kinds of multiscale models, in other words, cobble\ntogether the resources of theories at different levels of\ndescription. So they provide for interesting examples that\nprovoke our thinking about intertheoretic relationships, and that\nchallenge the widely-held view that an inconsistent set of laws can\nhave no models. \n",
