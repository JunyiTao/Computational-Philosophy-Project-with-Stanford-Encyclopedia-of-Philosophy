This is part of\nhis larger project of reconstructing and reviving \u201cthe sciences\nof the ancients\u201d: his scientific project in metaphysics is\ninseparable from his interpretation and assimilation of\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics. We start with some motivation\nfor F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s larger project of reconstructing\n\u201cthe sciences of the ancients\u201d, then turn to what he says\nabout metaphysics as one such science and about Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics, and then to details of his reconstruction of\nmetaphysics as a science, both in his account of maximally universal\nconcepts such as being and unity, and in his account of God as the\nfirst cause of existence.\n",
