Signs and the \u201cLanguage of Action\u201d\n\nLike Reid after him, Condillac drew a distinction between three kinds\nof signs: accidental, natural, and instituted (Essay I.ii.4).\n\n\nAccidental signs are objects or circumstances that have been\nfrequently encountered in conjunction with an object, so that the\noccurrence of the former induces the mind to imagine the latter.\nThough he made a great deal of the significance of his employment of\nthe principle of association when giving summary presentations of his\nwork, one of Condillac\u2019s great shortcomings is his treatment of\nassociation. He did little more than employ the term. Unlike Hume, he\ndid not distinguish between resemblance, contiguity, and cause and\neffect, and he offered no detailed analysis of causal association.\nWhen compared with Hume\u2019s accounts of how association is\nresponsible for our beliefs about matters of chance and probability,\nour trust in testimony, our reliance on general rules, and our\ntendencies to allow our reasoning to be influenced by credulity,\neducation, and passion, Condillac\u2019s account of association is\nvery impoverished.\n\nNatural signs are the cries and gestures that we instinctively produce\nupon having particular experiences. Unlike Reid, Condillac insisted\nthat we are not born with a knowledge of the meaning of natural signs;\nwe are only born with the disposition to produce them on certain\noccasions. We produce them, moreover, without intending to do so and\nwithout intending to communicate anything by them. We only discover\nthat they have a certain signification through hearing or seeing\nourselves or others produce the sign on characteristic occasions, and\nso coming to associate the latter with the former. To go in the other\ndirection, and produce the sign in order to induce the thought of some\ncircumstance in others, would be to use the sign as an instituted\nrather than a natural sign.\n\nThe same might be said of accidental signs. To imagine dawn upon\nhearing the crow of a cock is to be affected by an accidental sign; to\nimitate the crow of a cock in order to signify dawn is to institute a\nsign, and is an operation of a higher order.\n\nReid was later to maintain that the creation of instituted signs\npresupposes an agreement among a community of speakers, which in turn\npresupposes language, and this led him to declare that there must be\nsome language that is innately understood rather than established by\nconvention. But Condillac had already explained how an artificial\nlanguage can be instituted without innately understood signs\n(Essay II.i.1. \u00a7\u00a71\u20134). Familiarity with the\nsignification of natural signs, which are instinctively produced but\nnot innately understood, will lead one to think of the sign upon\nwitnessing the object that it signifies. For example, having learned\nto associate the cries that are made by those attacked by a wild\nanimal with those circumstances, I will think of those cries upon\nseeing a wild animal approach and think of the effect that hearing\nthem has previously had on myself and others. It is then a small, but\nmomentous step to utter those cries in order, first, to signify the\napproach of a wild animal to others and induce them to flee, and then\nto signify this particular danger to oneself or others without\nbothering to imagine an approaching wild animal, as a way of\nabbreviating the process of thought. With this step, a move is made\nfrom being affected by accidental and natural signs we happen to\nchance upon in the course of experience to employing instituted signs\nto stand for experiences. The first stage in taking this step is the\ndevelopment of what Condillac called the \u201clanguage of\naction,\u201d a language composed of cries and gestures culled from\nnatural language. A spoken language of arbitrary sounds and a written\nlanguage are then gradually invented by users of the language of\naction (Essay II.i.1. \u00a7\u00a75\u20138).\n\nSince memory just is the imagination of signs, the development of\ninstituted signs makes memory possible (natural and accidental signs\nare only ever sensed, not remembered). The institution of signs\nfurther allows us to set up names for groups of ideas that are too\ncomplicated to be distinctively yet collectively imagined, such as\nideas of any number larger than six, of substances, of complex modes\n(notably moral and aesthetic qualities) and of genera and species of\nthings (Essay I.iv). It is also supposed to give us control\nover our imagination and an ability to govern our attention\n(Essay I.ii.4. \u00a746). This allows us to reflect on other\naspects of our experience than those most immediately related to our\nneeds. Reflection brings connections between objects to our attention\nthat we would not otherwise notice and puts us in a position to refine\nour language by instituting names for what we have discovered. A more\nrefined language facilitates yet more exact reflection, and language\nand our reflective capacities proceed to work in tandem to develop our\ncognitive abilities to their highest level (Essay\nI.ii.5).\n",
