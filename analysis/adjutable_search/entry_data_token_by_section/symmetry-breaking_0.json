    "main_text": "The Concept of Symmetry\n1. The Concept of Symmetry\n\nThe term \u201csymmetry\u201d derives from the Greek words\nsun (meaning \u2018with\u2019 or \u2018together\u2019)\nand metron (\u2018measure\u2019), yielding\nsummetria, and originally indicated a relation of\ncommensurability (such is the meaning codified in Euclid\u2019s\nElements for example). It quickly acquired a further, more\ngeneral, meaning: that of a proportion relation, grounded on (integer)\nnumbers, and with the function of harmonizing the different\nelements into a unitary whole. From the outset, then,\nsymmetry was closely related to harmony, beauty, and unity, and this\nwas to prove decisive for its role in theories of nature. In\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus, for example, the regular polyhedra are\nafforded a central place in the doctrine of natural elements for the\nproportions they contain and the beauty of their forms: fire has the\nform of the regular tetrahedron, earth the form of the cube, air the\nform of the regular octahedron, water the form of the regular\nicosahedron, while the regular dodecahedron is used for the form of\nthe entire universe. The history of science provides another\nparadigmatic example of the use of these figures as basic ingredients\nin physical description: Kepler\u2019s 1596 Mysterium\nCosmographicum presents a planetary architecture grounded on the\nfive regular solids.\n\nFrom a modern perspective, the regular figures used in Plato\u2019s\nand Kepler\u2019s physics for the mathematical proportions and\nharmonies they contain (and the related properties and beauty of their\nform) are symmetric in another sense that does not have to do with\nproportions. In the language of modern science, the symmetry of\ngeometrical figures \u2014 such as the regular polygons and polyhedra\n\u2014 is defined in terms of their invariance under specified groups\nof rotations and reflections. Where does this definition stem from? In\naddition to the ancient notion of symmetry used by the Greeks and\nRomans (current until the end of the Renaissance), a different notion\nof symmetry emerged in the seventeenth century, grounded not on\nproportions but on an equality relation between elements that are\nopposed, such as the left and right parts of a figure. Crucially, the\nparts are interchangeable with respect to the whole \u2014\nthey can be exchanged with one another while preserving the original\nfigure. This latter notion of symmetry developed, via several steps,\ninto the concept found today in modern science. One crucial stage was\nthe introduction of specific mathematical operations, such as\nreflections, rotations, and translations, that are used to describe\nwith precision how the parts are to be exchanged. As a result, we\narrive at a definition of the symmetry of a geometrical figure in\nterms of its invariance when equal component parts are\nexchanged according to one of the specified operations. Thus, when the\ntwo halves of a bilaterally symmetric figure are exchanged by\nreflection, we recover the original figure, and that figure is said to\nbe invariant under left-right reflections. This is known as the\n\u201ccrystallographic notion of symmetry\u201d, since it was in the\ncontext of early developments in crystallography that symmetry was\nfirst so defined and\n applied.[1]\n The next key step was the generalization of this notion to the\ngroup-theoretic definition of symmetry, which arose following the\nnineteenth-century development of the algebraic concept of a group,\nand the fact that the symmetry operations of a figure were found to\nsatisfy the conditions for forming a\n group.[2]\n For example, reflection symmetry has now a precise definition in\nterms of invariance under the group of reflections. Finally, we have\nthe resulting close connection between the notion of symmetry,\nequivalence and group: a symmetry group induces a partition into\nequivalence classes. The elements that are exchanged with one another\nby the symmetry transformations of the figure (or whatever the\n\u201cwhole\u201d considered is) are connected by an equivalence\nrelation, thus forming an equivalence\n class.[3]\n\nThe group-theoretic notion of symmetry is the one that has proven so\nsuccessful in modern science. Note, however, that symmetry remains\nlinked to beauty (regularity) and unity: by means of the symmetry\ntransformations, distinct (but \u201cequal\u201d or, more generally,\n\u201cequivalent\u201d) elements are related to each other and to\nthe whole, thus forming a regular \u201cunity\u201d. The way in\nwhich the regularity of the whole emerges is dictated by the nature of\nthe specified transformation group. Summing up, a unity of\ndifferent and equal elements is always associated with symmetry,\nin its ancient or modern sense; the way in which this unity is\nrealized, on the one hand, and how the equal and different elements\nare chosen, on the other hand, determines the resulting symmetry and\nin what exactly it consists.\n\nThe definition of symmetry as \u201cinvariance under a specified\ngroup of transformations\u201d allowed the concept to be applied much\nmore widely, not only to spatial figures but also to abstract objects\nsuch as mathematical expressions \u2014 in particular, expressions of\nphysical relevance such as dynamical equations. Moreover, the\ntechnical apparatus of group theory could then be transferred and used\nto great advantage within physical\n theories.[4]\n\nWhen considering the role of symmetry in physics from a historical\npoint of view, it is worth keeping in mind two preliminary\ndistinctions:\n\nThe first is between implicit and explicit uses of the notion.\nSymmetry considerations have always been applied to the description\nof  nature, but for a long time in an implicit way only. As we\nhave seen, the scientific notion of symmetry (the one we are\ninterested in here) is a recent one. If we speak about a role of this\nconcept of symmetry in the ancient theories of nature, we must be\nclear that it was not used explicitly in this sense at that time.\nThe second is between the two main ways of using symmetry. First,\nwe may attribute specific symmetry properties to phenomena or to laws\n(symmetry principles). It is the application with respect to\nlaws, rather than to objects or phenomena, that has become central to\nmodern physics, as we will see. Second, we may derive specific\nconsequences with regard to particular physical situations or\nphenomena on the basis of their symmetry properties (symmetry\narguments).\n\n",
