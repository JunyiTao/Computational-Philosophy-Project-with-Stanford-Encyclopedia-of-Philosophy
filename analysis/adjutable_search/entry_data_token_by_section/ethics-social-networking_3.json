    "main_text": "Early Philosophical Concerns about Online Social Networks || Borgmann\u2019s Critique of Social Hyperreality\n2.1 Borgmann\u2019s Critique of Social Hyperreality\n\nBorgmann\u2019s early critique (1984) of modern technology addressed\nwhat he called the device paradigm, a technologically-driven\ntendency to conform our interactions with the world to a model of easy\nconsumption. By 1992\u2019s Crossing the Postmodern Divide,\nhowever, Borgmann had become more narrowly focused on the ethical and\nsocial impact of information technologies, employing the concept of\nhyperreality to critique (among other aspects of information\ntechnology) the way in which online social networks may subvert or\ndisplace organic social realities by allowing people to \u201coffer\none another stylized versions of themselves for amorous or convivial\nentertainment\u201d (1992, 92) rather than allowing the fullness and\ncomplexity of their real identities to be engaged. While Borgmann\nadmits that in itself a social hyperreality seems \u201cmorally\ninert\u201d (1992, 94), he insists that the ethical danger of\nhyperrealities lies in their tendency to leave us \u201cresentful and\ndefeated\u201d when we are forced to return from their\n\u201cinsubstantial and disconnected glamour\u201d to the organic\nreality which \u201cwith all its poverty inescapably asserts its\nclaims on us\u201d by providing \u201cthe tasks and blessings that\ncall forth patience and vigor in people.\u201d (1992, 96)\n\nThere might be an inherent ambiguity in Borgmann\u2019s analysis,\nhowever. On the one hand he tells us that it is the\ncompetition with our organic and embodied social presence\nthat makes online social environments designed for convenience,\npleasure and ease ethically problematic, since the latter will\ninevitably be judged more satisfying than the \u2018real\u2019\nsocial environment. But he goes on to claim that online social\nenvironments are themselves ethically deficient:\n\nThose who become present via a communication link have a diminished\npresence, since we can always make them vanish if their presence\nbecomes burdensome. Moreover, we can protect ourselves from unwelcome\npersons altogether by using screening devices\u2026.The extended\nnetwork of hyperintelligence also disconnects us from the people we\nwould meet incidentally at concerts, plays and political gatherings.\nAs it is, we are always and already linked to the music and\nentertainment we desire and to sources of political information. This\nimmobile attachment to the web of communication works a twofold\ndeprivation in our lives. It cuts us off from the pleasure of seeing\npeople in the round and from the instruction of being seen and judged\nby them. It robs us of the social resonance that invigorates our\nconcentration and acumen when we listen to music or watch a\nplay.\u2026Again it seems that by having our hyperintelligent eyes\nand ears everywhere, we can attain world citizenship of unequaled\nscope and subtlety. But the world that is hyperintelligently spread\nout before us has lost its force and resistance. (1992, 105\u20136)\n\n\nCritics of Borgmann saw him as adopting Heidegger\u2019s (1954 [1977])\nsubstantivist, monolithic model of technology as a singular,\ndeterministic force in human affairs (Feenberg 1999; Verbeek 2005).\nThis model, known as technological determinism, represents\ntechnology as an independent driver of social and cultural change,\nshaping human institutions, practices and values in a manner largely\nbeyond our control. Whether or not this is ultimately Borgmann\u2019s\nview (or Heidegger\u2019s), his critics saw it in remarks of the\nfollowing sort: \u201c[Social hyperreality] has already begun to\ntransform the social fabric\u2026At length it will lead to a\ndisconnected, disembodied, and disoriented sort of life\u2026It is\nobviously growing and thickening, suffocating reality and rendering\nhumanity less mindful and intelligent.\u201d (Borgmann 1992,\n108\u20139)\n\nCritics asserted that Borgmann\u2019s analysis suffered from his lack\nof attention to the substantive differences between particular social\nnetworking technologies and their varied contexts of use, as well as\nthe different motivations and patterns of activity displayed by\nindividual users in those contexts. For example, Borgmann neglected\nthe fact that physical reality does not always enable or facilitate\nconnection, nor does it do so equally for all persons. For example,\nthose who live in remote rural areas, neurodivergent persons, disabled\npersons and members of socially marginalized groups are often not well\nserved by the affordances of physical social spaces. As a consequence,\nAndrew Feenberg (1999) claims that Borgmann overlooked how online\nsocial networks can supply sites of democratic resistance for those\nwho are physically or politically disempowered by many\n\u2018real-world\u2019 networks.\n",
