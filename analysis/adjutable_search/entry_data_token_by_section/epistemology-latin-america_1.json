    "main_text": "Skepticism\n2. Skepticism\n\nIt is safe to say that skepticism is the main issue discussed by Latin\nAmerican scholars working in epistemology, judging by the number of\nworks devoted to it. In addition, in certain Latin American countries\nthere is a short but strong tradition of scholarship on both the\nhistory and the philosophical significance of skepticism. This is why\nit is the first topic to be addressed in this entry.\n\nAs Cresto (2010a: 468) points out, the study of the history of\nskepticism is one of the lines of research to be considered when\nproviding an overview of epistemological investigation in Latin\nAmerica. But contrary to what she claims, it is hard to find any\nsystematic epistemological discussion of skepticism in the numerous\nworks in which Latin American scholars have dealt with the history of\nancient or modern skepticism. Still, it is primarily in connection\nwith the study of ancient Pyrrhonism that the field has seen the\nemergence of systematic discussions of the nature of skepticism and\nthe epistemic challenges it raises. Pyrrhonism is the variety of\nskepticism most commonly dealt with in the works of Latin American\nacademics, both in general and in connection with epistemological\nissues.\n\nThe Latin American tradition of scholarship on the history of ancient\nand modern skepticism started in the 1970s with Oswaldo Porchat\nPereira (1933\u20132017) in Brazil and Ezequiel de Olaso\n(1932\u20131996) in Argentina, who were in close contact and\nco-organized two conferences on skepticism: one in Campinas (Brazil)\nin 1986 and one in Buenos Aires (Argentina) in 1992. Porchat pursued\nhis undergraduate and graduate studies in philosophy at the\nUniversidade de S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), obtaining a Ph.D. with a\ndissertation on Aristotle\u2019s conception of science. He spent\nresearch periods in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France,\nwhere he was heavily influenced by French historians of philosophy. He\nwas professor at USP and the founder of both the philosophy department\nand the Centro de L\u00f3gica, Epistemologia e Hist\u00f3ria da\nCi\u00eancia (on which see\n Section 1)\n at UNICAMP.\n\nDe Olaso obtained his B.A. (Licenciatura) in philosophy from\nthe University of Buenos Aires and his Ph.D. in the same field from\nBryn Mawr College, with a dissertation on Leibniz and ancient\nskepticism. He taught at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata, the\nUniversidad de Buenos Aires, and the Universidad de San Andr\u00e9s,\nall in Argentina. He was also a researcher at the Consejo Nacional de\nInvestigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET) of\nArgentina, and a founding member of the Centro de Investigaciones\nFilos\u00f3ficas (CIF, 1965) and its journal Revista\nLatinoamericana de Filosof\u00eda (RLF, 1975). He also seems to\nhave helped Porchat in the foundation of CLE.\n\nWhile Porchat\u2019s studies on skepticism (all but one, Porchat\nPereira 2013, collected in his 2007 book) bear almost exclusively on\nthe Pyrrhonism expounded in the extant works of the second-century\nphysician Sextus Empiricus, de Olaso\u2019s are concerned not only\nwith Sextus\u2019s Pyrrhonism (de Olaso 1983, 1988, 1992), but also\nwith Hume\u2019s and Leibniz\u2019s discussions of skepticism,\nparticularly in its Pyrrhonian variety (de Olaso 1974, 1977, 1978,\n1980, 1984). Towards the very end of his life, de Olaso\u2019s\nwritings focused on epistemology as practiced in the analytic\ntradition: e.g., he offered an analysis of the concepts of certainty,\nknowledge, and skepticism, and of their relations, in both modern and\ncontemporary philosophy (de Olaso 1999), but without making an\noriginal contribution to the present-day debates on those issues.\nWhile Porchat considered himself a skeptic, de Olaso did not, adopting\na much more critical approach to skepticism. We will here focus on\nPorchat both because he claimed to adopt a neo-Pyrrhonian stance and\nparticularly because it has been said that his writings offer\nsignificant epistemological reflections on skepticism. However, first,\nwhen discussing ancient Pyrrhonism in his published work, he seldom\ntouches on, or proposes solutions to, the most complex interpretive\nand philosophical questions posed by Sextus\u2019s presentation of\nPyrrhonism, and he cursorily engages with only a tiny part of the vast\nspecialist literature. We make this remark because some of those\nquestions extensively discussed in the secondary literature concern\nintriguing epistemological problems: e.g., the epistemic challenge\nposed by the Five Modes of Agrippa, the attack on the criterion of\ntruth, the Pyrrhonist\u2019s stance on the standards of justification\nand norms of rationality, and the possibility of skeptical inquiry.\nAnd secondly, when proposing his neo-Pyrrhonism, he completely\ndisregards the hundreds of epistemological studies on skepticism in\ngeneral or on Pyrrhonism in particular published especially since the\nlate 1970s. The reason is simply that Porchat does not engage in any\nsystematic discussion of epistemological matters. (For a different\nappraisal of Porchat\u2019s work, see Smith & Bueno 2016 and\nSmith 2018.)\n\nIt must nonetheless be observed that, unlike de Olaso\u2019s,\nPorchat\u2019s teaching and writings exerted a strong influence on\nhis students, to the extent that several of them devoted their own\nwork to the study of skepticism, creating in Brazil a relatively large\ncommunity of academics interested in that philosophical movement. The\nwork of those Brazilian scholars influenced by Porchat has been\nprimarily exegetical and historical, with special focus on ancient and\nmodern skepticism. A clear exception is Ot\u00e1vio Bueno (b. 1970),\nwho after completing his B.A. and M.A. studies at USP, did his Ph.D.\nat the University of Leeds and is at present a professor at the\nUniversity of Miami. Although Bueno\u2019s main areas of research are\nthe philosophy of science, the philosophy of mathematics, and logic,\nhe has also discussed epistemological issues in connection with\nskepticism, particularly of a Pyrrhonian stripe. He has argued that it\nis mistake to claim that the Pyrrhonist is in the end committed to\nepistemic internalism, given that the latter\u2019s arguments against\nepistemic externalism are merely dialectical (Bueno 2011). He has also\nrejected the view that the Pyrrhonist cannot induce the state of\nsuspension of judgment on the basis of the Agrippan mode from\ndisagreement alone (Bueno 2013). In other articles in which Pyrrhonism\nis also taken into account, Bueno has critically assessed Donald\nDavidson\u2019s and Ernest Sosa\u2019s responses to skepticism\n(Bueno 2005 and 2009, respectively). It is finally worth mentioning\nthat he has defended a Pyrrhonian approach to contemporary science, in\nconnection with Bas van Fraassen\u2019s (1980) constructive\nempiricism (Bueno 2015, 2021).\n\nRegarding Brazilian scholarship on epistemological skepticism, three\nother researchers may be mentioned: Pl\u00ednio Junqueira Smith (b.\n1964), Waldomiro Jos\u00e9 da Silva Filho (b. 1966), and Claudio\nGon\u00e7alves de Almeida (1960).\n\nSmith, who pursued his undergraduate and graduate studies in\nphilosophy at USP, is probably the Brazilian scholar most influenced\nby Porchat\u2019s teaching and writings. He is currently a professor\nat the Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo (UNIFESP) and the\neditor of the Brazilian journal Sk\u00e9psis\n(2007)\u2014one of the two journals devoted to skepticism (co-)edited\nin Latin America. Although his work bears mainly on the history of\nmodern skepticism, Smith has recently written somewhat more\nepistemologically oriented papers devoted to Porchat\u2019s skeptical\nstance (Smith 2015) and to what he regards as Barry Stroud\u2019s\nneo-Pyrrhonism (Smith 2016).\n\nDa Silva Filho obtained his B.A. in philosophy from the Universidade\nEstadual de Santa Cruz and his M.A. and Ph.D. in communication and\ncontemporary culture from the Universidade Federal da Bahia (UFBA).\nCurrently a professor at UFBA, he works in the fields of philosophy of\nmind and epistemology. In some of his publications, he has examined\ncertain skeptical difficulties concerning self-knowledge (da Silva\nFilho 2007, 2008). Even though he was not one of Porchat\u2019s\nstudents, he has also been influenced by Porchat\u2019s skeptical\nstance.\n\nDe Almeida obtained his B.A. in social communication from the\nPontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio Grande do Sul\n(PUCRS), his M.A. in philosophy from USP, and his Ph.D. in philosophy\nfrom McMaster University (Canada). Currently a professor at PUCRS, his\nmain area of research is epistemology. He has written on epistemic\nclosure and skepticism\u2014arguing inter alia that neither\nknowledge nor epistemic justification are closed under logical\nimplication and that this closure-failure does not affect Cartesian\nskepticism (de Almeida 2007, 2012)\u2014and on Stroud\u2019s\ninfluential interpretation of Cartesian skepticism, which de Almeida\nclaims is crippled by a level confusion (de Almeida 2016).\n\nAs regards Argentina, one finds several researchers exploring\nskepticism in the context of contemporary epistemology, among whom one\nmay mention Eleonora Cresto (b. 1971), Juan Comesa\u00f1a (b. 1972),\nand Diego Machuca (b. 1976).\n\nCresto\u2019s initial interest in skepticism arose under the\ninfluence of de Olaso, who supervised her B.A. thesis at the\nUniversidad de Buenos (UBA). She later on pursued her M.A, M.Phil.,\nand Ph.D. at Columbia University. Currently a researcher at CONICET\nand a professor at the Universidad Nacional de Tres de Febrero in\nArgentina, she works primarily in formal epistemology (on which see\n Section 4).\n In her first published papers, she critically examined both\nreliabilist and naturalistic anti-skeptical responses proposed in the\nliterature, finding them unsatisfactory (Cresto 1996a, 1996b), but\nalso put forward a reliabilist reply of her own to skepticism (Cresto\n1997).\n\nAfter pursuing his undergraduate studies at UBA, Comesa\u00f1a\nobtained his Ph.D. from Brown University under Sosa\u2019s\nsupervision, and is at present a professor at Rutgers University. In\nBuenos Aires, he was a founding member of the influential but\nnow-defunct Grupo de Acci\u00f3n Filos\u00f3fica (GAF). Having\npublished on various epistemological issues (on which see\n Section 3),\n he has devoted some studies to skepticism. He has offered useful\noverviews of both the so-called Pyrrhonian problematic and skepticism\nin general (Comesa\u00f1a 2006a and 2009a, respectively). He has\nalso explored whether the contemporary theories of contextualism and\ncontrastivism can help Pyrrhonists offer a philosophically\nsatisfactory reply to the traditional objection according to which\nthey are reduced to inactivity because action requires belief and they\nclaim to suspend judgment regarding either philosophico-scientific\nbeliefs or all beliefs whatsoever. Comesa\u00f1a\u2019s verdict is\nnegative (Comesa\u00f1a 2011).\n\nMachuca, who pursued his undergraduate and graduate studies in\nArgentina, obtaining his Ph.D. at UBA, is currently a researcher at\nCONICET and the editor (with Duncan Pritchard) of the\nInternational Journal for the Study of Skepticism (2011).\nHaving initially devoted himself to examining Sextus\u2019s\nPyrrhonism and moral skepticism, he has more recently focused also on\na systematic discussion of skepticism in relation to epistemological\nissues. He has looked at the relevance of Pyrrhonism to contemporary\ntheories of knowledge and justification and, in particular, to the\npresent-day debate over the epistemic significance of disagreement,\ndefending a neo-Pyrrhonian stance (Machuca 2013b, 2015a, 2017a, 2022).\nHe has also examined the connection between disagreement and\nskepticism in general, arguing inter alia that a radical\ndisagreement-based skepticism cannot be dismissed out of hand as being\npatently untenable or absurd (Machuca 2015b, 2017b).\n\nIn other Latin American countries, one finds some epistemological\nstudies on skepticism, and Pyrrhonism in particular, but interest in\nthis topic is much more sporadic. We will here summarize the works of\nPedro Stepanenko (Mexico) and Mauricio Zuluaga (Colombia) that are\nmore epistemological in nature.\n\nStepanenko (b. 1960), a specialist on Kant, obtained a Ph.D. in\nphilosophy at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, where\nhe is currently a professor and a member of the Instituto de\nInvestigaciones Filos\u00f3ficas (on which see\n Section 1).\n In Stepanenko (2011), he argues that, by using either a conditional\nor a disjunctivist interpretation of his appearance-statements, the\nPyrrhonian skeptic can report on his own experiences without being\nepistemically committed to the beliefs one usually accepts when\nascribing mental states to oneself.\n\nZuluaga obtained his B.A. and M.A. in philosophy from the Universidad\nde los Andes and the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, respectively,\nand his Ph.D. in the same field from the\nLudwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (Germany). He is\ncurrently a professor at the Universidad del Valle (Colombia). Zuluaga\nhas looked at Agrippa\u2019s trilemma in the context of contemporary\nepistemological discussions of the regress argument, but his approach\nis merely expository: he limits himself to providing an overview of\npart of the literature on the trilemma and on the problems faced by\nfoundationalism and coherentism (Zuluaga 2005). He has also written\nabout contemporary reconstructions of Cartesian skepticism that are\nbased on the closure principle (Zuluaga 2012), but his approach is\nagain entirely expository.\n",
