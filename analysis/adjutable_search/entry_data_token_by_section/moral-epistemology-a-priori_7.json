    "main_text": "A Priori Justification and Late 20th Century Naturalism || Cornell Realism\n4.1 Cornell Realism\n\nCornell realism (so named because its best known proponents are\nassociated with Cornell University) is a version of naturalistic\nrealism; it holds that there are moral properties (and thus moral\nfacts), but that moral properties are natural properties.\n\nEpistemologically, there are two significant features of Cornell\nrealism. First, it accepts a coherence theory of justification.\nSecond, it applies to moral epistemology the claim from the philosophy\nof science that observations are theory-laden. According to\ncoherentism, beliefs are not justified individually, but holistically,\nin virtue of their membership in a coherent system of beliefs.\nEspecially within ethics, a coherent system of beliefs is often\nreferred to as being in a state of \u201creflective\nequilibrium\u201d (see entry on\n reflective equilibrium).\n The term \u201creflective equilibrium\u201d is also used to refer\nto an idealized method via which inquirers bring their moral beliefs\ninto coherence by reflecting on their considered moral judgments and\ngeneral principles intended to capture these judgments, and\neliminating any conflicts that emerge by making adjustments to either\nthe considered judgments or the general principles. Neither considered\nmoral judgments nor general principles are always favored. What the\ninquirer revises in each case of conflict is determined by what seems\nmost likely to be true to the inquirer. A number of commentators on\nreflective equilibrium have observed that it is a sophisticated\ncontemporary version of intuitionism in which considered moral\njudgments, or more properly, the considered judgments and moral\nprinciples that seem most likely to be true, play essentially the same\nrole in determining the moral theory eventually accepted that\nself-evident moral intuitions did for earlier intuitionists.\nReflective equilibrium may allow for initially credible considered\njudgments and moral principles to be revised more than one would\nexpect to see traditionally understood intuitions being revised, but\nin the end what seems to be true upon reflection determines the system\nof judgments and principles accepted in reflective equilibrium. Hence,\none might be tempted to assume that those who accept reflective\nequilibrium, such as Cornell realists, are committed to a\npriori justification playing a significant role in moral\nepistemology even though what plays the role of intuitions is not\nassumed to be self-evident. As we will see, this temptation should be\nresisted.\n\nLet\u2019s begin by noting that one influential criticism of\nreflective equilibrium is that what seem to function as intuitions are\njust what seem to the inquirer to be true; there is not even the\npretense that these have some special status, such as self-evidence.\nEarlier intuitionists might be criticized for claiming propositions\nare self-evident when they are not. But reflective equilibrium may\nlead inquirers to do nothing more than build a coherent moral system\naround strongly held beliefs that in fact have no positive epistemic\nstatus. (We cannot pursue this criticism further but for an important\nearly response see Daniels 1979).\n\nObservation of the vapor tracks made by charged particles in a cloud\nchamber is a favorite example used to illustrate theory-laden\nobservation. A scientist could not observe, say, a positron, if the\nscientist did not already believe various theories, e.g., regarding\nsub atomic particles and how such particles will affect the medium in\nthe cloud chamber when they pass through it. But this does not mean\nthat experienced scientists make a theory-neutral observation of what\nhappens in a cloud chamber and then draw inferences regarding the sub\natomic particles from their theories and the theory-neutral\nobservation. That might have been what scientists had to do early on\nin the development of the cloud chamber and the relevant theories. But\nnow when experienced scientists watch what happens in a cloud chamber,\nthey will spontaneously and non-inferentially form beliefs about\npositrons, muons and the like; such spontaneous beliefs are real\nobservations. Experienced scientists make such observations in just\nthe way an ordinary person might observe a dog or cat in the front\nyard.\n\nCornell realists hold that the same thing happens in the moral realm.\nWe all hold what is in effect a moral theory. The reasons we come to\nhold the theory initially are not important, so long as the theory is\nclose enough to the truth. Richard Boyd (1988), for instance, suggests\nthat our background moral theory identifies moral goodness with those\nproperties that are conducive to the satisfaction of human needs, both\nphysical and psychological. Having internalized this theory, we are\nable to make moral observations. For example, when we see photographs\nof the prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison during the American\noccupation of Iraq we certainly recognize that treating persons in the\nways depicted frustrates some significant psychological needs. But\nthis will not be our primary reaction. When we view these photographs\nwe spontaneously judge that the treatment of the prisoners was wrong\nor abusive (where it should be emphasized that the latter involves a\nstrong moral component). This spontaneous moral belief may be\ndependent upon our background moral views; if we did not accept some\nmoral theory we would not have made it. But, according to the Cornell\nrealists, the belief is still an observation because it is\ntheory-laden rather than being inferred from a theory conjoined with\nvarious non-moral observations. It is what happens in science, and as\nin science, the fact that moral observations are theory-laden does not\nprevent them from helping to support our moral theory. As in science,\nexplanatory relations are important, e.g., the fact that the prisoners\nat Abu Ghraib were wrongly treated, where this fact of being wrongly\ntreated is something like the natural fact of their being seriously\nharmed, is part of the best explanation of our observing that what was\ndone to them was wrong. On this view, neither the moral theory nor the\nmoral observations are epistemologically prior; both are justified in\nvirtue of the coherence of the entire system of moral beliefs.\n\nThe interesting feature of Cornell realism, for our purposes, is that\ndespite the fact that spontaneous moral beliefs\u2014that some refer\nto as intuitions\u2014play a significant role, a priori\njustification plays no significant role in its moral epistemology.\nBoth our more particular moral beliefs and our moral theories will be\njustified in virtue of their coherence, not their self-evidence; the\nconsidered moral judgments that are significant members of the\ncoherent system of moral beliefs, and that some see as old-fashioned\nintuitions, are interpreted as observations, not rational insights.\nFor Cornell realism, the justification of our moral beliefs crucially\ndepends upon experience, specifically, moral observation.\n",
