To mention just two\nconclusions, Dewey found that whichever qualities exhibited by\nreligious experience (feelings of peace, wholeness, security, etc.),\nnone offered evidence for the supernatural. In other words, a\nreligious experience\u2019s report can no more count as a\njudgment about causation than pointing to a book\u2019s description\ncan prove a physical law (ACF, LW9ff.).\n\nA second conclusion was that religious experience is not hermetic,\nunable to color or affect other experiences. Just a sunset may have an\n\u201caesthetic\u201d element or a linguistic remark may have a\n\u201cmoral\u201d tint, there may be a religious coloration of a\nvariety of experiences (ACF, LW9: 9.). Understood in this\nsense, the \u201creligious\u201d character of experience is an\nattitude, one lending \u201cdeep and enduring support to the\nprocesses of living\u201d (ACF, LW9: 15). Dewey analyzed\nreligiosity in this sense by comparing it with a certain kind of\ncoping. Consider three options: (1) one can accommodate an\nobstacle by merely resigning to put up with the conditions they\nimpose; (2) one can adapt or modify the obstacle\u2019s\nconditions to one\u2019s liking; finally, (3) one can adjust\nto the obstacle in such a way that one both changes\none\u2019s attitude and alters the conditions. (Consider, as\nadjustment, the case of of becoming a parent which\ndemands significant changes that encompass both self\nand environment.) This last option (3) of adjustment\nis characteristic of religious experience for it is \u201cinclusive\nand deep seated\u201d and transformative of attitudes in\n\u201cgeneric and enduring\u201d ways (ACF, LW9: 12,13). In\nadjustment, imaginative possibilities are projected and then put into\naction\u2014both in oneself (wants, aims, ideals) and in surrounding\nconditions\u2014and the cumulative impact is an evolution of identity\n(ACF, LW9:\n 13).[58]\n",
