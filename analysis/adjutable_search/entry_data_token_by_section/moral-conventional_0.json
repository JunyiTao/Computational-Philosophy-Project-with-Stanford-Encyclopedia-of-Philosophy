    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nStarting in the early 1950s, with the publication of R.M. Hare\u2019s\nThe Language of Morals (1952), a large philosophical\nliterature began to appear aimed at specifying the distinctive or\nessential characteristics of moral judgments and moral principles.\nParticipants in these discussions often said their goal was to provide\nand defend a definition of morality, and The Definition of\nMorality (Wallace & Walker 1970a) was the title of a valuable\ncollection of papers drawn from that literature that included essays\nby Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa Foot, William Frankena, Alasdair\nMacIntyre, Peter Strawson, and a number of other well-known\nphilosophers. Another large literature, much of it quite technically\nsophisticated, was inspired by David Lewis\u2019s seminal volume,\nConvention, published in\n 1969.[1]\n But it is only much more recently that philosophers have focused on\nthe distinction between moral judgments and conventional judgments,\nand sought to use that distinction in arguments about a wide array of\nphilosophical topics, ranging from the plausibility of metaethical\ntheories to the moral responsibility of psychopaths.\n\nThe emergence of a philosophical literature analyzing and invoking\nwhat has become known as \u201cthe moral/conventional\ndistinction\u201d can be traced to a growing awareness, among\nphilosophers, of the enormously influential work of developmental\npsychologist Elliot Turiel and his many collaborators, most notably\nMelanie Killen, Larry Nucci, and Judith\n Smetana.[2]\n This group of researchers are often called \u201csocial domain\ntheorists\u201d. The sections 3 through 10 of this entry will focus\non debates, in both psychology and philosophy, about the existence,\nthe nature, and the importance of the moral/conventional distinction.\n Section 11\n will consider some of the ways in which the social domain\ntheorists\u2019 account of the moral/conventional distinction, and\nrelated ideas, have been used in philosophical discussions of a\nvariety of issues.\n\nThe literature on convention that emerged in the wake of Lewis\u2019s\nbook is rarely discussed in the work of Turiel and his collaborators\nand it plays almost no role in their\n thinking.[3]\n But the philosophical literature on the definition of morality did\nplay an important role in Turiel\u2019s thinking. So before\nconsidering social domain theory, it will be useful to recount a pair\nof relevant facts about that literature.\n",
