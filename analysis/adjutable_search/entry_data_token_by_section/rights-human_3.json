    "main_text": "Which Rights are Human Rights?\n3. Which Rights are Human Rights?\n\nThis section discusses the question of which rights belong on lists of\nhuman rights. The Universal Declaration\u2019s list, which has had\ngreat influence, consists of six families: (1) Security rights that\nprotect people against murder, torture, and genocide; (2) Due process\nrights that protect people against arbitrary and excessively harsh\npunishments and require fair and public trials for those accused of\ncrimes; (3) Liberty rights that protect people\u2019s fundamental\nfreedoms in areas such as belief, expression, association, and\nmovement; (4) Political rights that protect people\u2019s liberty to\nparticipate in politics by assembling, protesting, voting, and serving\nin public office; (5) Equality rights that guarantee equal\ncitizenship, equality before the law, and freedom from discrimination;\nand (6) Social rights that require that governments ensure to all the\navailability of work, education, health services, and an adequate\nstandard of living. A seventh category, minority and group rights, has\nbeen created by subsequent treaties. These rights protect women,\nracial and ethnic minorities, indigenous peoples, children, migrant\nworkers, and the disabled.\n\nNot every question of social justice or wise governance is a human\nrights issue. For example, a country could have too many lawyers or\ninadequate provision for graduate-level education without violating\nany human rights. Deciding which norms should be counted as human\nrights is a matter of considerable difficulty. And there is continuing\npressure to expand lists of human rights to include new areas. Many\npolitical movements would like to see their main concerns categorized\nas matters of human rights, since this would publicize, promote, and\nlegitimize their concerns at the international level. A possible\nresult of this is \u201chuman rights inflation,\u201d the\ndevaluation of human rights caused by producing too much bad human\nrights currency (See Cranston 1973, Orend 2002, Wellman 1999, Griffin\n2008). \n\nOne way to avoid rights inflation is to follow Cranston in insisting\nthat human rights only deal with extremely important goods,\nprotections, and freedoms. A supplementary approach is to impose\nseveral justificatory tests for specific human rights. For example, it\ncould be required that a proposed human right not only protect some\nvery important good but also respond to one or more common and serious\nthreats to that good (Dershowitz 2004, Donnelly 2003, Shue 1996,\nTalbott 2005), impose burdens on the addressees that are justifiable\nand no larger than necessary, and be feasible in most of the\nworld\u2019s countries (on feasibility see Gilabert 2009 and Nickel\n2007). This approach restrains rights inflation with several tests,\nnot just one master test.\n\nIn deciding which specific rights are human rights it is possible to\nmake either too little or too much of international documents such as\nthe Universal Declaration and the European Convention. One makes too\nlittle of them by proceeding as if drawing up a list of important\nrights were a new question, never before addressed, and as if there\nwere no practical wisdom to be found in the choices of rights that\nwent into the historic documents. And one makes too much of them by\npresuming that those documents tell us everything we need to know\nabout human rights. This approach involves a kind of fundamentalism:\nit holds that when a right is on the official lists of human rights\nthat settles its status as a human right (\u201cIf it\u2019s in the\nbook that\u2019s all I need to know.\u201d) But the process of\nidentifying human rights in the United Nations and elsewhere was a\npolitical process with plenty of imperfections. There is little reason\nto take international diplomats as the most authoritative guides to\nwhich human rights there are. Further, even if a treaty\u2019s\nratification by most countries can settle the question of whether a\ncertain right is a human right within international law, such a treaty\ncannot settle its weight. The treaty may suggest that the right is\nsupported by weighty considerations, but it cannot make this so. If an\ninternational treaty enacted a right to visit national parks without\ncharge as a human right, the ratification of that treaty would make\nfree access to national parks a human right within international law.\nBut it would not be able to make us believe that the right to visit\nnational parks without charge was sufficiently important to be a real\nhuman right (see Luban 2015).\n",
