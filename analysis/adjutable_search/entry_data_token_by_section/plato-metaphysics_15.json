    "main_text": "The Method of Hypothesis\n16. Conclusion\n\n\nThe images of the central books do not settle the question of\nwhether or not the objects of the different faculties are the same. In\nappealing to a contents analysis, fundamentally an analysis that takes\npropositions to be the contents or \u2018objects\u2019 of belief and\nknowledge, as opposed to the objects themselves, i.e., material\nparticulars or Forms, one allows that there is a path from belief to\nknowledge. The same proposition can be believed or known, depending on\none's reasons or justification for holding the belief. But a contents\nanalysis is not committed to a justified true belief account of\nall knowledge. It is left open that knowledge of Forms is\nsomehow basic. Descending the line furnishes justification for the\nclaims of the dianoetic sciences and beliefs about the material world,\nincluding the states of affairs in actual cities. What to do about the\nbasic knowledge of Forms is a key issue. Sun, Line and Cave suggest to\nmany readers that knowledge of Forms is intuitive or acquaintance-like.\nOn the other hand, the refrain that one who knows can give an account\n(logos) of what he knows suggests knowledge by description or\na propositional analysis. To emphasize relations between Forms,\nstarting from the relation of the Good to all Forms, lends credence to\nthe view that Plato is an epistemological holist. Holism is fueled by\nthe search for definitions, since in order to know what, for instance,\nHuman is, one must know all the elements of its definition, Animal,\nRationality, Bipedality, and thus the definition of these elements, and\nso on. In order to know a given Form, one must know all the Forms, an\nextreme version of holism, or at least one must know all the Forms in a\ngiven science. The results of this analysis, the genera and species of\na given science, are then hypostasized as Forms, nodes in a web or the\nelements of a field. There is a virtuous circle of justification.\n\n\nHolist readings can also be combined with the narrow reading of\nrecollection. The same (token) proposition may well be entertained by\nthe philosopher as by those who still rely on concepts gleaned from\ntheir everyday encounters. Whether or not one knows or believes that\n\u2018The triangle has three sides\u2019 depends on what one is doing\nwith that content or how one is justifying one's belief. The problem is\nthat if somehow knowing that the triangle has three sides makes\n\u2018triangle\u2019 in the statement refer to the Form, while\nbelieving that (same?) proposition makes it refer to something else,\nthen the content of the two states is different, and the content of the\nstates is different because, it seems, the objects of the two states\nare different. Or one can try to save one's holism by allowing that the\ndifferent states of mind cause (the contents of) the propositions to be\ndifferent. Those who see recollection as an act engaged in only by\nphilosophers maintain that their concept differs from the empirically\ngrounded concept of the non-recollector, the occupant apparently of at\nleast two of the other three stages of Line. But how one gets from the\none concept to the other is unspecified. The concepts are linked by the\n\u2018external fact\u2019 that the temple, for instance, participates\nin Beauty. The holist program seems to entail that one can continue to\nadd to beliefs about Beauty, where one is deploying the empirical\nconcept, until one in a proper justificatory exercise acquires\nall the appropriately related beliefs about properties. Once\nthat is accomplished, the philosophical concept is recollected. It\nremains open on this account, when one has recollected the Form and\nthen descends, whether the contents of the philosopher's beliefs about\nthe empirical world use the philosophical or empirical concept.\n\n\nThose who read Plato as subscribing to different objects for\nKnowledge and Belief also need a story about how one gets from one\nstage to the next. If we assume that Forms are at work throughout the\nlearning process, then Plato is best viewed as not identifying the Form\nwith the propositional contents of his states. The same expression\nwill, depending on the state of the agent, have different referents:\nthe images; the material objects; some immaterial, abstract\nintermediary, or a mathematical in the case of dianoia. On the\nobjects account, Plato has little to say about the status of the\nconcepts deployed in thought. The Form of Equality is not the concept.\nThe concept is present throughout the developmental life of the human.\nBecause (knowledge of) the Form is latent in the mind, sensation and\neveryday talk are capable of \u2018triggering\u2019 the concept. A\nselect individual will come to disdain the senses and the material\nobjects of the sensible world and try to explain what accounts for the\nsimilarities present in his experience. The first fundamental moment of\ntransition seems to be a shift from the many particulars to some\nabstract general notion, an inchoate \u2018one-over-many\u2019. That\nshe is able to isolate these \u2018ones' at all is, according to the\nbroad reading of recollection, due to the unconscious operation or\ninfluence of the Form that allows her to sort the perceptions into\nkinds. The ontological status of these kinds is not, as yet, clear to\nher. With the further development of her dialectical capacity, the\nphilosopher-to-be comes to think that there are Forms; that is, comes\nto think that there are special entities variously related to\nparticulars and property-instances. The objects of these beliefs are\nstill not the Forms themselves, if the state of mind of the scientist\nor Phaedan hypothesizer is not yet knowledge. At this stage, or even\nearlier, one might even be in possession of the definition of the Form\nand still not have knowledge. Exactly why one lacks knowledge is hard\nto say. It is not, it seems, because he lacks beliefs about the\nrelation the Forms bear to other mathematical notions. On the one hand,\nit is doubtful that Plato believes that one can know all of mathematics\nor that one can know what a triangle is only if one knows every other\nshape. On the other hand, the mathematician does seem to know as much\nas would be needed to qualify as having knowledge of the mathematical\nForms. The philosopher is not said to know more mathematics than the\nmathematician. He secures his knowledge in way the mathematician can't\nor doesn't.\n\n\nIf \u2018more truths\u2019 are added to the truths in the\npossession of the mathematician, these can only be truths about the\nnature of Forms. These higher logoi will then be general\nmetaphysical principles about the role of the Good, the simplicity or\ncomplexity of Forms, the specification of the participation relation\nand so on (not a trivial \u2018and so on\u2019. ) Plato does then\nplace fantastically high demands on knowledge. The desire to ensure\nirrefutability, perhaps the legacy of reflection on the Socratic\nelenchus, drives him to the conclusion that one really has recollected\nthe Form only when one has become a metaphysician. She need (only!)\nknow the general metaphysical theory.\n\n\nThere is little reason to think that Plato espouses a holism of\nknowledge of the sort discussed above. Plato never says that the\nmathematician or the philosopher needs to know all the truths\nof mathematics or ethics to know some Form. Moreover, while Plato does\nprescribe a course of study in the Republic designed to\npromote one's dialectical abilities, and while it is agreed by both\nholists and intuitionists, those who allow for atomic or\nacquaintance-like knowledge of a Form, that the same Forms are the\nbasic objects of knowledge, it does not follow that Plato thinks that\nthere is only one way to secure knowledge of the Forms. If there are\ndifferent paths to knowledge, or different ways to know a given Form,\nthen Plato's epistemology is liable to appear to be both holistic and\nacquaintance-like. As for when and where Recollection is operative, or\nwhether Plato allows that a philosopher (or scientist) can know\nanything about the physical world, it is left to each reader of the\ndialogues to judge whether Plato is committed to gulfs between both\nthe ordinary concepts of most humans and the special concepts of the\nfew philosophers, as well as between the perfect Forms and the\nseemingly imperfect physical world. Since a Platonic dialogue is a\ndialectical conversation designed to summon the mind of the reader\ntowards philosophizing, it is appropriate that each reader struggle to\ndiscover for himself What Knowledge Is.\n",
