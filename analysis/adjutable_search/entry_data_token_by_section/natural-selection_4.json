Natural Selection as the Interpretation of a Component of a Formalism\n\nOne of the two chief uses of the notion of natural selection is as an\ninterpretation of one or another quantity in formal models of\nevolutionary processes; this is the focused sense distinguished above.\nTwo different quantities are called selection in different formal\nmodels widely discussed by philosophers. On the one hand, fitness\ncoefficients are said to quantify selection in type recursion models\nof selection; the \\(w\\)\u2019s in the above genotypic selection\nmodel are fitness coefficients. This is standard textbook usage (Rice\n2004; Hedrick 2011). The recursive structure of these models is\nimportant. They can be used to infer how a system will behave into the\nfuture (though of course only if causes of the variables in the system\ndo not change their values in dynamically-relevant ways that are not\nexplicitly modeled in the recursive equations). At their simplest,\ntype recursions make system dynamics a function of fitness\ncoefficients weighting type frequencies/numbers together with\neffective population size (quantifying drift), as in the genotypic\nselection model discussed above. More complex variants of type\nrecursions include frequency-dependent selection models, for cases in\nwhich population members\u2019 fitness is a function of the type\nfrequency variables; density-dependent selection models, for cases in\nwhich fitness is a function of population size; spatially and\ntemporally variable selection models, for cases in which fitness\nvaries as a function of a varying environmental variable that\ninteracts with type differences, and many more. Writers working with\ntype recursion models have developed explicit interpretations of their\ntheoretical terms, including the fitness variables quantifying\nselection. So, for instance, Beatty and Millstein defend the view that\nthe fitness coefficients representing selection in type recursions\nshould be understood as modeling a discriminate sampling process,\nwhile drift, controlled by effective population size, should be\nunderstood as indiscriminate sampling (Beatty 1992; Millstein\n2002).\n\nPhilosophers have also contended that particular terms in models of\nsystems featuring the formation of groups (or collectives) should be\nunderstood as quantifying the influence of selection at different\nlevels. So, some type recursions of systems involving groups feature\n\u201cgroup fitness\u201d or \u201ccollective fitness\u201d\nparameters, ones analogous to individual or particle fitness\nparameters. Kerr and Godfrey-Smith (2002) discuss one such system of\nrecursions; Jantzen (2019) defends an alternative parameterization of\ngroup selection as part of different system of equations. (See also\nKrupp 2016 for causal-graphical conceptualization of the notion of\ngroup selection.) For much more on multi-level selection, see entry on\n units and levels of selection.\n\nThe other formal model of particular interest to philosophers is the\nPrice Equation. The Price Equation represents the extent of evolution\nin a system with respect to a given trait across a single generation\nusing statistical functions: \n\n\\[\nW\\Delta Z = \\textrm{Cov}(w_i,z_i)+\\mathrm{E}(w_i \\Delta z_i)\n\\]\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\\(z_i\\) denotes the character value of the\n\\(i\\)thpopulation member\n\\(\\Delta Z\\) is the change in average character value in the\npopulation\n\\(w_i\\) denotes the number of offspring produced by (the fitness\nof) the \\(i\\)thpopulation member\n\\(W\\) is the average number of offspring produced by population\nmembers\nE is expectation\nCov is covariance\n\n\n\nIn the Price Equation, selection is associated with the first\nright-hand side quantity, while the second represents transmission\nbias.\n\nIdentities among algebraic functions of statistical functions make\npossible the mathematical manipulation of the Price Equation such that\nit may feature a variety of different quantities. As with type\nrecursions, quantities in various transformations of the Price\nEquation are equated with selection at different levels for different\nsystems; Okasha, following Price, treats the covariance of the fitness\nof collectives with the phenotype of collectives as collective-level\nselection, while the average of the within-collective covariances\nbetween particle character and particular fitness is identified with\nparticle-level selection. The persistence of altruistic variants in\nnatural populations has been explained as the result of the\nstabilizing conflict between selection at these different levels\n(Sober & Wilson 1998; and again see entry on\n units and levels of selection.\n The Price Equation can equally be manipulated to yield distinct\nnotions of inheritance; Bourrat distinguishes temporal, persistence,\nand generational heritabilities and argues for the temporal notion as\nappropriate for the purposes of stating conditions for evolution by\nnatural selection (Bourrat 2015). \n\nThe distinction between type recursions and the Price Equation is\nimportant, because selection is interpreted differently in each. The\ntwo formalisms will issue in different verdicts about whether, and the\nextent to which, focused selection operates within a single system. If\nwe fix upon a single natural system, and ask how selection operates\nwithin it, we will get different answers if we associate selection\nwith fitness variables in type recursions rather than\n\\(\\textrm{Cov}(w_{i},z_{i})\\) in the Price Equation. To see this,\nconsider how type recursions are structured such that inferences about\ndynamics over multiple generations may be made by means of them. If\nfitness coefficients in these models quantify selection, and these\ntake fixed values (as they do in the genotypic selection model\nconsidered above and a great many others), then the extent of\nselection will remain the same over the time period governed by the\nmodel: the fitness variables remain at fixed values so selection\nremains an unchanging influence. But, in just the same cases, the\nvalue of \\(\\textrm{Cov}(w_{i},z_{i})\\) in the Price Equation will\nchange across generations as the system evolves: the covariance\nfunction in the Price Equation will be highest at intermediate\nfrequencies, when evolution proceeds quickly, and lowest at liminal\nones, when evolution goes more slowly. Consider, for instance, the\nextent to which the population evolves, according to the genotypic\nselection model above, when the following values are plugged into the\nmodel: \n\n\\[\np = 0.9, \nq = 0.1, \nw_{D} = 1, \nw_{H} = 0.8, \nw_{R} = 0.6\n\\]\n\n\nIn that case, the frequency of the \\(A\\) alleles moves from 0.9 to\n0.92 across a single generation; there is some covariance between\n\\(A\\) types and reproduction. Inputting \\(p = 0.5,\\) and\n\\(q = 0.5,\\) the frequency change is greater, \\(A\\) types go\nfrom being half the population to frequency 0.56, and the covariance\nbetween offspring production and being an \\(A\\) type is\ncorrespondingly greater as well.\n\nTo see even more starkly how what is called selection in the Price\nEquation differs from what is called selection in type recursions,\nconsider a system exhibiting heterozygote superiority like the one\nfrom earlier, where \\(w_{D} = w_{R} < w_{H}.\\) Recall that a system\nof this sort will evolve to a stable equilibrium (provided drift is\nidealized away). Using the recursive equations above, the reader can\ninput values that meet the constraint that heterozygotes have the\nhighest fitness, set \\(p' = p,\\) and compute the stable equilibrium\nvalue for \\(p\\), the frequency of the \\(A\\) alleles. If we\nunderstand selection as quantified by the fitness coefficients in this\nsort of set-up, then the whole time, selection operates in a constant\nfashion, since the fitness coefficients remain fixed. In particular,\nthe operation of selection is the same when the system is evolving\ntoward its stable equilibrium as when it remains at that stable\nequilibrium. By contrast, the covariance term in Price Equation model\nof the system will diminish in value until it reaches zero as the\nsystem evolves to its equilibrium state. When selection is identified\nwith the covariance between type and reproduction, the frequency of\nthe different types matters to the extent of selection. When selection\nis identified with fitness variables in type recursions, the frequency\nof different types has no influence on the extent of selection in the\nsystem. Thus, the different interpretations of selection that\ncorrespond to different quantities in different formal models are\nactually incompatible. We should expect, then, at least one of these\ninterpretations of selection to fail, since focused selection cannot\nbe two different things at once, at least if what counts as natural\nselection is non-arbitrary.\n\nOne way to reconcile these competing interpretations of selection is\nto make first right-hand side term in the Price Equation quantify\nthe extent of the influence of selection in a system. If we\nassume that focused selection accounts for whatever covariance exists\nbetween parental offspring number and phenotype, then we may treat the\nfirst right-hand side term of the Price Equation as a measure of the\nextent of the influence of focused selection, at least at a given type\nfrequency (see Okasha 2006: 26). This approach puts the logical house\nin order, allowing for a univocal concept of selection, but it does so\nat the expense of other commitments. To note just one, the Price\nEquation will no longer be causally interpretable, since its\nquantities may no longer be said to represent causes (but instead\nmeasure the extents of their influences given further limiting\nassumptions). There exists a sizable literature on which of multiple\nalternative manipulations of the Price Equation represents the actual\ncausal structure of different sorts of system (see Okasha 2016 and\n section 5\n below for more on this issue).\n\nIt was noted earlier that if what counts as selection is\nnon-arbitrary, then it cannot be the case that what is quantified by\nthe \\(w\\)\u2019s in type recursions and the covariance of\noffspring number and phenotype both count as selection. A substantial\ndebate has arisen over the question of whether what counts as\nselection is indeed non-arbitrary. In particular, some philosophers\ndubbing themselves \u201cstatisticalists\u201d have challenged the\nnon-arbitrary character of the distinction, claiming that it is\nmodel-relative (Walsh, Lewens, & Ariew 2002; Walsh 2004, 2007;\nWalsh, Ariew, & Matthen 2017). (For more on the arbitrariness of\nthe selection/drift distinction, see entry on\n genetic drift).\n A related issue, discussed in the subsequent section, concerns the\ncausal interpretability of the theory: Advocates of the non-arbitrary\ncharacter of selection also typically treat selection and drift not\nonly as non-arbitrary quantities, but also as causes, while those who\nallege that the distinction is arbitrary typically equally challenge\nthe treatment of selection and drift as causes. \n\nThere exists very little discussion of formal models in statisticalist\nwritings; various toy scenarios are put forward instead, and these are\nnot analyzed using the techniques of formal population genetics\n(Matthen & Ariew 2002; Walsh, Lewens, & Ariew 2002; Walsh\n2007; Walsh, Ariew, & Matthen 2017). When biologically realistic\nscenarios are discussed, systems of equations for inferring how such\nsystems behave are not made part of the discussion (for more on\npopulation genetics, see entry on\n population genetics).\n We consider next a case they discuss because it provides a way of\ncontrasting how the contrast between selection and drift is made in\ntype recursions and how it is made in the Price Equation. There is a\nsort of arbitrariness here, but it emerges only from analysis of a\nhypothetical system using population genetics modeling techniques.\n\nIn a recent paper, Walsh, Ariew, and Matthen put forward a case of\ntemporally variable selection and claim that it could be treated as a\ncase either of selection or of drift (2017). The case is of a\ndiscrete-generation system with yearly reproduction in which each of\ntwo types of organisms produce different numbers of offspring\ndepending on whether the year is warm or cold, with each type of year\nbeing equally probable: the H types produce 6 offspring in warm years\nwhile the T types produce 4, and the reverse holds for cold years. The\nauthors take the position that the system \u201clooks like\u201d\nboth a case of selection and a case of drift, but without\nconsideration of any formal model of it. Instead, we are invited to\nthink it is a case of selection because the fitnesses of the different\ntypes vary year-to-year; we are invited to think it is a case of drift\nbecause, allegedly, over long stretches of time the two types have\nequal fitnesses and we should, allegedly, predict no net increase in\nfrequency for either type (Walsh, Ariew, & Matthen 2017:\n12\u201313).\n\nThe scenario is illuminating because it involves randomness that\ncannot be quantified by effective population size in a type recursion\nbut can be quantified as such by the drift parameter in Price\nEquation. When deploying type recursions, we must treat cases of\ntemporally variable selection as cases of selection, but we are under\nno similar constraint when it comes to the Price Equation.\n\nThe dynamics of the warm/cold system cannot be inferred from a type\nrecursion in which fitness coefficients are set equal and\nnext-generation frequencies are determined entirely by the\n\u201cdrift\u201d term, effective population size in the binomial\nsampling equation. When fitnesses are equal, the frequency of each\ntype is determined solely by the binomial sampling equation above\n(since post-selection frequency, the input to the sampling equation,\nis just pre-selection frequency). Such a determination makes\nnext-generation frequency a normal, bell-shaped distribution whose\nmean is the initial frequency of the types in the system. The\ndistribution of next-generation frequencies in the warm/cold system\ndoes not look like this. The type recursions for the warm/cold system\nmust be calculated using a temporally variable selection model:\n\n\\[\np' = \\frac{w^{t}_{w} p}{w^{t}_{w}p + w^{t}_{c}q}\n\\]\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\\(p\\) is the frequency of warm types\n\\(q\\) is the frequency of cold types\n\\(w^{t}_{w}\\) is the fitness of warm types in year \\(t\\)\n\\(w^{t}_{c}\\) is the fitness of cold types in year \\(t\\)\n\n\n\nWhat is inputted into the binomial sampling equation, \\(p'\\), when the\ndynamics of the system are calculated using the temporally variable\nselection model is never the same as what is inputted into the\nbinomial sampling equation when the dynamics of the system are treated\nas solely a function of drift. In the latter case, the input into the\nequation is just \\(p\\). But since the temperature always favors one\nor another type, post-selection frequency, \\(p'\\) is never equal to\npre-selection frequency, \\(p\\). Treating a system of warm/cold type\nthat undergoes temporally variable selection as though it undergoes\ndrift would lead to making false inferences about its dynamics. Cases\nof temporally variable selection of the warm/cold sort simply must be\nmodeled using type recursions in which fitness parameters are a\nfunction of time; the pioneering analysis of such systems was done by\nDempster (1955). The above point generalizes: what is quantifiable as\nselection and drift in type recursions is made definite by how fitness\nvariables and effective population size function in those models.\n\nThe story is different, however, with the Price Equation, owing to how\nrandomness is handled in that formalism. A version of the Price\nEquation in which both selection and drift are represented is this\n(Okasha 2006: 32): \n\n\\[\nW\\Delta Z = \\textrm{Cov}(w_{i}^{*},z_{i}') + \\textrm{Cov}(\\mu_{i}, z_{i}')\n\\]\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\\(\\Delta Z\\) is the change in average character value in the\npopulation\n\\(W\\) is the average number of offspring produced by population\nmembers\n\\(w_{i}^{*}\\) is the expected fitness of the \\(i\\)th\npopulation member\n\\(z_{i}'\\) is the average character value of the\n\\(i\\)th population member\u2019s offspring \n\\(\\mu_{i}\\) is deviation from expectation of the\n\\(i\\)th population member\u2019s offspring\nproduction\n\n\n\nHere, the second term quantifies change due to drift (Okasha 2006:\n33). Note how the \\(\\mu_{i}\\) parameter quantifies deviation from\nexpectation, and hence drift is a function of how the expectation is\ndetermined. Nothing about the Price Equation formalism constrains such\ndeterminations. In the warm/cold population, whether a given\nyear\u2019s evolution is quantified by the first right-hand side\nterm, and hence constitutes change due to selection, or the second\none, and hence constitutes change due to drift, will be determined by\nwhether the theorist treats the weather as contributing to expected\nfitness. If, for instance, she is ignorant of how the weather changes\nyear to year, she may treat the weather as drift; if she can predict\nit, she may not do so. Deployment of the Price Equation is compatible\nwith both treating the weather as contributing to expected fitness and\ntreating it as causing deviation from expectation.\n\nThe result is that a theorist deploying the Price Equation may treat\nas drift (that is, quantify as deviation from expectation) what a\ntheorist deploying type recursions must treat as selection (quantify\nby fitness variables). It is possible to make assumptions using the\nPrice Equation such that the drift term quantifies what is quantified\nby the drift term in type recursions, but nothing about the Price\nEquation proper forces one to do this, and indeed proponents of the\nPrice Equation, such as Grafen (2000), tout how the drift term in the\nPrice Equation may quantify all sorts of randomness, explicitly\nincluding randomness that is not quantifiable as drift in type\nrecursions.\n\nAs noted earlier, selection and drift are construed in logically\ndistinct fashions in type recursions and the Price Equation. What is\ncalled is selection in type recursions is one sort of definite thing:\nit\u2019s whatever it is that must be quantified by fitness\nvariables. What is called selection in the Price Equation is another\nthing, and this will be determined by researchers\u2019 understanding\nof the system, in particular how they generate expectations about\nfitness. Ultimately, the conflict between the two modeling approaches\nwith respect to what counts as selection may be resolvable in at least\na couple of ways. Perhaps one modeling approach is simply wrong about\nwhat selection is. Alternatively, something having to do with\nselection is arbitrary here. In particular, whether some or another\nform of randomness should be treated as selection or drift is a\nfunction of one\u2019s choice of which modeling approach to use,\nwhere distinct approaches provide logically distinct understandings of\n\u201cselection\u201d and \u201cdrift\u201d. Once one chooses to\nmodel the system using type recursions, one\u2019s hand is forced:\nthe temperature must be modeled as selection. Once one chooses to\nmodel the system using the Price Equation, one\u2019s hand remains\nfree: one may treat the changing temperature as relevant to expected\nfitness, and hence treat it as selection, or instead treat it as\nproducing deviation from expectation, and thereby treat it as drift.\nAccording to this second way of resolving the conflict, the choice\nbetween the two modeling approaches is not dictated by nature, and is\nthus at least metaphysically (if not pragmatically) arbitrary.\n",
