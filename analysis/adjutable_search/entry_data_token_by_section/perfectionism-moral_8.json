    "main_text": "Perfectionism in Politics || The Principle of State Neutrality\n3.1 The Principle of State Neutrality\n\n\nMany contemporary writers on politics reject perfectionism and hold\nthat the state should be neutral among rival understandings of the\ngood (Dworkin 1978; Ackerman 1980; Larmore 1987; Rawls 1993). The\nprinciple of state neutrality, as it can be called, articulates a\nprincipled constraint on permissible or legitimate state action.\nThe constraint can, and has been, formulated in different\n ways.[6]\nThree formulations of the\nconstraint have attracted support of late, and can be mentioned\nbriefly\n here.[7]\n\nThe state should not promote the good, either coercively\nor non-coercively, unless those who are subject to the state\u2019s\nauthority consent to its doing so.\nThe state should not aim to promote the good unless there\nis a societal consensus in support of its doing so.\nThe state should not justify what it does by appealing to\nconceptions of the good that are subject to reasonable\ndisagreement.\n\n\n\nAs these formulations bring out, the idea of state neutrality has\nbeen understood broadly in recent political\n philosophy.[8]\nA natural interpretation of the principle\nwould allow the state to promote the good, so long as it did so in an\neven-handed manner. But most proponents of state neutrality wish\nto keep the state out of the business of promoting the good altogether,\nat least if the good to be promoted is controversial or subject to\nreasonable\n disagreement.[9]\n\n\nA perfectionist approach to politics rejects the principle of state\nneutrality on all these formulations. For perfectionists, there\nis no general principle in political morality that forbids the state\nfrom directly promoting the good, even when the good is subject to\ndisagreement. It will be helpful to spell out in a\nlittle more detail the implications of this rejection of state\nneutrality.\n\n\nThe first formulation presented above follows from a consent-based\naccount of political legitimacy. Contemporary Lockeans do not reject\nstate action the promotes the good, so long as the state action in\nquestion enjoys the consent of the governed (Simmons 2005).\nPerfectionist political theory rejects consent theory and so rejects\nthis formulation of the neutrality constraint. The second formulation\nappeals to societal consensus, rather than actual consent. It holds\nthat in large pluralistic societies, the state should not aim to\npromote the good, since what is considered good often will be subject\nto controversy. This formulation of the constraint is not\nextensionally equivalent to the first one, since there can be a\nsocietal consensus that an institution or practice is good and ought\nto be supported by the state even when there is not universal\nagreement on the matter.\n\n\nThe second formulation is vulnerable to the following objection.  A\nstate might intentionally promote a particular religion, adherence to\nwhich was backed by a firm societal consensus.  This state does not\nlook to be a neutral state. The second formulation confronts another\nproblem.  It targets the aims of state officials.  But these aims are\nnot always open to view, and state officials may have a variety of\nmotives in mind when they make political decisions.  For this reason,\nsome have thought that it is more promising to apply the neutrality\nconstraint not to the aims of state officials, but rather to the\njustifications they give in public for the decisions they make. This\nyields the third formulation of the neutrality constraint. Defenders\nof state neutrality often defend the doctrine by appealing to the\nideal of public reason. Public reasons, they argue, must be shareable\nin a way that excludes appeal to controversial ideals of the\ngood. Thus state neutrality and public justification in politics\nemerge as different sides of the same\ncoin.[10]\n\n\nRecently, some proponents of state neutrality have argued that the\nthird formulation of the constraint is insufficiently demanding.\nState action may have an adequate neutral justification and yet remain\nnon-neutral.  For example, if state action that was designed to\npromote a particular religion were justified on the grounds that doing\nso were an effective means to serve some neutral end, such as civil\npeace, then the action would remain non-neutral, even if otherwise\njustified (Patten 2012, Kramer 2017). In response, proponents of state\nneutrality can propose a fourth formulation of the constraint, one\nthat combines elements from the second and third formulations.\n\nThe state should not justify what it does by appealing to\nconceptions of the good that are subject to reasonable disagreement.\nNor should it promote neutral ends by aiming to promote some\npermissible conceptions of the good over others.\n\n\n\nThis formulation of state neutrality applies to both the means and ends \nof state action.[11]\n\n\nFormulations of the neutrality constraint, such as the ones distinguished here,\nfigure in recent influential versions of social contract theory, most\nnotably that of Rawls and his followers (Nagel 1991; Rawls 1993; Barry\n1995). These views represent the chief contemporary rival to\nperfectionist political theory. In developing an account of\npolitical morality, these modern day contractualists instruct us to\nbracket our full understanding of the human good. Only by so\ndoing, is it possible to present an account of political morality that\nhas a hope of securing the allegiance of citizens who hold very\ndifferent conceptions of the good.\n\n\nThe plausibility of the principle of state neutrality remains very\nmuch in dispute in contemporary political philosophy. Proponents\nof the principle maintain that state neutrality is necessary if the\nstate is to respond appropriately to the fact that reasonable citizens\nin modern democratic societies are committed to conflicting conceptions\nof the good. They also hold that state neutrality is vital to\nensuring stable and mutually beneficial social cooperation in these\nsocieties. Those sympathetic to perfectionist politics\ncounter: (1) That support for valuable forms of life requires\npolitical action and that strict adherence to the principle of state\nneutrality \u201cwould undermine the chances of survival of many\ncherished aspects of our culture;\u201d (Raz 1986, 162) (2) That\nit is possible to reject state neutrality and embrace value pluralism\nand hold that there are a plurality of good, but incompatible, forms of\nlife fully worthy of respect (Raz 1986); (3) That proponents of state\nneutrality overvalue the goods associated with agreement and undervalue\nother goods (Wall 1998); and (4) That state neutrality is neither\nnecessary or sufficient for stable social cooperation and for\npreventing the abuse of state power (Sher 1997).\n\n\nMuch of the debate over state neutrality assumes that there is a\nstrict incompatibility between state neutrality and perfectionist\npolitics. But, in reality, the relationship between the two is\nmore complex. While perfectionists reject the principle of state\nneutrality on its common formulations, they need not reject it on all\npossible formulations of the principle. To explain: some\nperfectionists, as just noted, embrace value pluralism and hold that\nthere are a plurality of good, but incompatible, forms of life fully\nworthy of respect. These perfectionists can claim further that\nthe truth of value pluralism explains how fully reasonable people can\nadopt and pursue different ideals of the good. With this idea in\nmind, they could propose the following restricted principle of state\nneutrality.\n\n\nRNP: If two or more ideals of the good are eligible for those\nwho live in a particular political society, and if these ideals have\nadherents in that political society, and if these ideals cannot be\nranked by reason as better or worse than one another, then the state,\nto the extent that it aims to promote the good in this political\nsociety, should be neutral between these ideals in its support of them.\n(Wall 2010)\n\n\nRNP restricts the scope of state neutrality to ideals of the good\nthat are fully reasonable. Whether or not it is a sound principle\nof political morality, it is a principle that both responds to the fact\nof reasonable pluralism and is available to the political\nperfectionist. Since RNP does not rule out state action that\npromotes reasonable over unreasonable conceptions of the good, a\nproponent of this principle can accept it while affirming the\nperfectionist claim that \u201ccertain conceptions of the good are\nworthless and demeaning, and that political action may and should be\ntaken to eradicate or at least curtail them\u201d (Raz 1986:\n133).\n",
