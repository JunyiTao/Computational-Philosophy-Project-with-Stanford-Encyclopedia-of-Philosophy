    "main_text": "Belief change and Dynamic Epistemic Logic\n4. Belief change and Dynamic Epistemic Logic\n\nUp to this point, the logics we have developed all have one key\nlimitation: an agent cannot meaningfully assimilate information that\ncontradicts her knowledge or beliefs; that is, incoming information\nthat is inconsistent with an agent\u2019s knowledge or\nbelief leads to difficulties. For example, if agent a believes\np, then announcing that p is false brings about a state\nin which the agent\u2019s beliefs are trivialized (in the sense that\nshe comes to believe every sentence):  \n\n\\[\\models [a]p\\to[\\lnot p!][a]F\\quad \\text{for all formulas } F.\\]\n\n\nNote that in the above, we may replace F by a contradiction\nsuch as the propositional constant \\(\\bot\\) for falsehood.\nAccordingly, an agent who initially believes p is lead by an\nannouncement that p is false to an inconsistent state in which\nshe believes everything, including falsehoods. This\ntrivialization occurs whenever something is announced that contradicts\nthe agent\u2019s beliefs; in particular, it occurs if a contradiction\nsuch as \\(\\bot\\) is itself announced:  \n\n\\[\\models[\\bot!][a]F\\quad \\text{ for all formulas } F.\\]\n\n\nIn everyday life, the announcement of a contradiction, when recognized\nas such, is generally not informative; at best, a listener who\nrealizes she is hearing a contradiction learns that there is some\nproblem with the announcer or the announced information itself.\nHowever, the announcement of something that is not intrinsically\ncontradictory but merely contradicts existing beliefs is an everyday\noccurrence of great importance: upon receipt of trustworthy\ninformation that our belief about something is wrong, a rational\nresponse is to adjust our beliefs in an appropriate way. Part of this\nadjustment requires a determination of our attitude toward the general\nreliability or trustworthiness of the incoming information: perhaps we\ntrust it completely, like a young child trusts her parents. Or maybe\nour attitude is more nuanced: we are willing to trust the information\nfor now, but we still allow for the possibility that it might be\nwrong, perhaps leading us to later revise our beliefs if and when we\nlearn that it is incorrect. Or maybe we are much more skeptical: we\ndistrust the information for now, but we do not completely disregard\nthe possibility, however seemingly remote, that it might turn out to\nbe true. \n\nWhat is needed is an adaptation of the above-developed frameworks that\ncan handle incoming information that may contradict existing beliefs\nand that does so in a way that accounts for the many nuanced attitudes\nan agent may have with respect to the general reliability or\ntrustworthiness of the information. This has been a focus of much\nrecent activity in the DEL literature. \n",
