    "main_text": "A complete worldview: metaphysics, taxonomies, cosmology || Six types of substances\n2.1 Six types of substances\n\nWe have just seen that the Jaina ethical effort is focused on\ndistinguishing what is the self from what it is not. This is what\nexplains that Jaina metaphysics is regularly presented as a dualism\nthat conceives the world a resulting from the activity of the elements\nbelonging to these two everlasting uncreated coexisting and\nindependent categories (Dixit 1971). This conception is close to that\nof S\u0101\u1e43khya philosophy, which admits of two irreducible\ncategories, namely the Experiencer (puru\u1e63a) and the\nExperienced (prak\u1e5bti), and which considers philosophy\nas the activity whose main goal is the disentanglement of these two\ncategories. Now, besides these shared fundamental conceptions, both\nclassifications deeply diverge (Bronkhorst 2007).\n\nIn Jainism, the self (j\u012bva) is more precisely\nunobstructed consciousness that concretely experiences cognition and\nperception. It is also what desires pleasure, reads pain, acts\nbeneficially or harmfully and experiences the fruit thereof. In other\nwords, being an influential active self is a condition of possibility\nfor the individual to make or unmake herself in the world, which is\nperceived by Jains as a condition of possibility for ethical\nresponsibility. Here, their conception differs from the one of\nS\u0101\u1e43khya philosophers, who consider that in deepest reality,\nthe self has never acted, and that all perceived activity is actually\nperformed by non-self stuff trying to imitate the self. From this,\nselves have never genuinely been bound by karma, and realizing this\nproper nature of things thanks to the yogic practice of meditation is\nalone sufficient to free from rebirth and karmic retribution. For more\non yoga and meditative practices in Jainism, see the Treatise on\nyoga (Yoga\u015b\u0101stra [Y\u015a]) by Hemacandra\n(1089\u20131172) (Chapple 2016; Tatia 1951).\n\nDespite the success of this conception and the fact that Jaina\nphilosophers share most of the necessary elements to also subscribe to\nthis conception, they will not take this direction. The reason for\nthis is that they need an active self, because moral distinctions lose\ntheir value on the hypothesis of the passivity of the soul. On this\npoint, they are also severe critics of theories of the creation of the\nworld by God (\u012a\u015bvara), in which the intelligent\nsubject is the mere product of an external intelligent principle; or\nof the fatalist theory according to which all things are fixed; to\nindicate but a few interlocutors.\n\nBesides, Jaina philosophers consider that there are as many selves as\nthere are living beings in the world. Each has a persisting\nself-identity preserved even in the ultimate condition, which is a\ncondition of possibility for ethical responsibility. Concerning\none\u2019s responsibility for a series of acts, Jaina authors are\nhighly critical, both of the Buddhist conception according to which\nthere is no self, and of the Brahmanic conception according to which\nthe individual self is ultimately undifferentiated with the universal\nself.\n\nFinally, there is a fixed amount of selves in the universe. Not only\nthe non-liberated ones go from one birth to the other in this cosmic\ncycle, but it will be the same ones who will continue to do so in the\nnext cosmic cycle, and so on. Besides, a self is fit, respectively\nunfit, for liberation. When a self is unfit, no amount of good act can\nchange this fact.\n\nSecond, the category of non-self (aj\u012bva) deals with the\nmatter and organisational principles thereof. To begin with, space\n(\u0101k\u0101\u015ba) is an all-pervading single indivisible\nwhole that includes both the part occupied by the world of things\n(loka) and the void and empty part beyond it\n(aloka). A point of space (prade\u015ba) is\nconceived as that which can be obstructed by one indivisible atom of\nmatter and which can give space to all types of particles.\n\nNow, space by itself is not a sufficient condition of motion and of\nrest. To avoid chaos, it is necessary to also postulate a medium of\nmotion (dharma), as well as a medium of rest\n(adharma). The traditional metaphor is that, as water is the\ncondition of the motion of fish, dharma and adharma\nare the condition of all motions. Here lies another specificity of\nJainism. While in other systems, dharma (etymologically\n\u201cwhat sustains\u201d) represents the only really sustainable\nstream of acts, the virtuous way of life, the worthy behavior,\none\u2019s teaching or religion, here it stands for the medium of\nmotion, while meritorious behavior is\n\u201cpu\u1e47ya\u201d (respectively, non-meritorious\nbehavior is \u201cp\u0101pa\u201d). This is an instance of\na Jaina tendency to physicalize the philosophical and ethical\nconcepts. If we understand dharma as the universal law\nestablishing what is fit and what is not, hereby accounting for\nmovements with an intention, we can understand that in the early Jaina\nconceptions, in which the concrete acts, not the intention, are\nforemost, dharma becomes what accounts for movements in\ngeneral.\n\nTogether, space, the medium of motion and the medium of rest are the\nconditions of motion of things that can move, while they are\nthemselves unaffected by movement. They are devoid of the qualities of\ntaste, color, smell, sound, contact. They pervade the whole universe,\nyet they are non-physical, non-atomic and non-discrete. These three\nsubstances form a unity, they have the same all-embracing size and\ncontinuous form. They are distinguished merely because of the\ndifference in their respective functions. They are the conditions for\nthe subsistence of all things, selves and matter, the connecting\nenvironment which binds together the isolated phenomena into an\nordered whole.\n\nAs for matter (pudgala), it is the material cause of body,\nspeech, mind and breath. This means that in this conception, not only\nbodies (\u015b\u0101rira), but also the physical mind, words,\nthoughts and breath, are types of subtle material substances. Matter\nis especially what accounts for the existence of karma, a subtle type\nof matter. To explain, there is a pan-Indian conception that what has\nparts is impermanent. In Jainism, matter is the only type of substance\nthat can associate or dissociate and, therefore, that has parts.\nTherefore, impermanence only comes from one\u2019s association with\nmatter. Contrarily to matter, (i) a self is a single atom devoid of\nparts and totally independent from both other selves and other\nsubstances; (ii) space, medium of motion and medium of rest are each a\nsingle indivisible whole that occupies all cosmic space; and (iii)\ntime has no extension.\n\nFurthermore, Jaina thinkers develop a complex system, with\ncalculations, to explain the practical effects of karma, for example\nthe precise mass of material particles assimilated after a given act,\nor the duration and intensity of this assimilation. This resembles\nphysics, and one specificity of Jaina philosophy is to focus on\ndeveloping this complex system of the mechanisms of karma, as seen in\nthe Essence of [the teachings of] Mah\u0101v\u012bra\n(Gomma\u1e6das\u0101ra [GS]) of Nemicandra (10th\ncentury CE). There are eight types of karmic matter (see TS 8.5),\ndivided in four harming (gh\u0101tiy\u0101) and four\nnon-harming (agh\u0101tiy\u0101) types (Jaini 1979). The\nharming types of karmic matter are:\n\ndelusory karma (mohan\u012bya), which reduces one\u2019s\ninnate bliss and brings about attachment to incorrect views. It\nnotably distorts one\u2019s appreciation of the categories of\nreality;\nknowledge-obstructing karma\n(j\u00f1\u0101na-avara\u1e47\u012bya), which covers the\nself, the mind and the senses, therefore impedes their natural\nabilities;\nperception-obstructing karma\n(dar\u015ban\u0101vara\u1e47\u012bya), which impedes\none\u2019s intuitions;\nobstacle karma (antar\u0101ya), which reduces one\u2019s\ninnate energy.\n\n\nAnd the four non-harming types of karmic matter are:\n\nfeeling karma (vedan\u012bya), which determines whether\nthe experiences of the self are pleasant or not;\nname karma (n\u0101man), which determines what sort of\nrebirth is attained;\nlife karma (\u0101yus), which decides the duration of\none\u2019s life;\nclan karma (gotra), which determines one\u2019s status\nwithin a species (Wiley 2011).\n\n\nFinally, time is what accounts for becoming. Time is not treated with\nother substances, because it has no extension. From this, it is not\nconsidered as a substance properly speaking, only in some aspects.\nEspecially, its existence can only be extrapolated from our awareness\nof phenomena. There is an absolute time (k\u0101la), which is\neternal, and a relative time (samaya), with a beginning and\nvariations, determined by the motion in things. Time is called the\ndestroyer, because all things are liable to dissolution of form in the\ncyclic course of time.\n",
