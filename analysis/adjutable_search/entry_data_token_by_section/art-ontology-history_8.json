    "main_text": "Monism and its rivals || Multiple vs. singular artistic items\n2.1 Multiple vs. singular artistic items\n\n\nMany debates over monism and rivals to that position have hinged on\nthe question of reproduction and multiple instances, the thought being\nthat in the case of at least some works, adequate technologies of\nreproduction yield more than one instance of an artistic artifact, and\ntherefore of the work (an entailment that does not go\nunchallenged, as we shall see below). For example, it would be highly\nimplausible to contend that Henri Cartier-Bresson\u2019s famous\nphotographic work, \u201cBehind the Gare Saint-Lazare, Paris\u201d\n(1932), consists in the negative used to make prints, or in the first\nor any other single print of this picture. Multiply instantiated works\nform one major category, then, while singular or non-reproducible ones\nform another.\n\n\nIt has been complained, however, that this distinction ought not to\nbe taken as decisive for an ontology of art since it rests upon a\ncontingent thesis about what is technologically possible.\n\n\nThe question of how technological change can influence our basic\nconception of works of art was raised by Walter Benjamin in a famous\nessay, a first version of which appeared in French in 1936 (translated\nliterally, the title is \u2018The Work of Art in the Age of its\nMechanical Reproducibility\u2019). Benjamin is generally interpreted\nas claiming that the advent of techniques of mechanical reproduction\nhas undermined the quasi-religious \u201caura\u201d that previously\nsurrounded the individual work of art. Benjamin appears to have viewed\nsuch technological change as part of a liberating or progressive\nhistorical process. Whether Benjamin held that no work of art really\nwas or could be an \u201cauthentic\u201d concrete particular is hard\nto determine, however, as the history of art\u2019s political\nfunctions is the primary focus of his somewhat obscure essay. Benjamin\ndoes declare early on (in both the first and revised versions of his\nessay) that \u201cIn principle, the work of art has always been\nreproducible. Objects made by humans could always be copied by\nhumans\u201d (2008, 20).\n\n\nOther philosophers have argued that technological possibility should\nnot be thought decisive with regard to the soundness of a monist\nontology of art: the important philosophical question is what is\nnomologically or metaphysically possible. A relatively early\nexample is C. I. Lewis\u2019s oft-overlooked (1946) discussion of the\nontology of the work of art.\n\n\nDrawing on the work of Pepper and D. W. Prall (1929, 1936), Lewis held\nthat an aesthetic appreciation of art is based on the contemplation of\nan \u201caesthetic essence\u201d presented by the work. Lewis\ndescribes an aesthetic essence as \u201ca certain composition of\nsense or qualia\u201d and as \u201can immediate apprehension of\nsense\u201d (1946, 188). Lewis also writes in this context of\n\u201cqualitatively identical items of content (Santayana\u2019s\n\u2018essences\u2019?)\u201d (1946, 18), thereby suggesting he is\nnot quite sure whether his notion of an essence comes close to that of\nGeorge Santayana, who described essences as the immediate data of\nexperience (1923). (For background, see the entry on Clarence Irving\nLewis, and especially the section on \u201cthe given.\u201d)\n\nWhen we appreciate a painting, Lewis contends, what we contemplate is\nwhat this canvas could have in common with some optimal reproduction\nof it, namely, \u201cthat qualitative and abstract essence which is\nhere incorporated, and is theoretically repeatable in some other\nphysical object\u201d (1946, 477). Lewis claims that an aesthetic\nobject always depends upon some physical object, but he maintains that\nthese dependency relations differ in degree: a poem depends on a\nparticular inscription less than a work of visual art depends on a\nparticular visible object. A poem, he proposes, is \u201can\nabstraction which is actualized in the instances of its presentation,\nthrough the medium of some physical vehicle. It is an entity\nessentially repeatable in, or common to, different physical events or\nthings which instance it\u201d (1946, 474\u2013475). Lewis goes on to say\nthat the abstractness of works is not like that of universals in that\nthe latter \u201cstand in contrast to anything which is sensuously\nqualitative and imaginal\u201d (1946, 475). Lewis also maintains that\na work or art is not just a type of visual appearance abstracted from\na physical object, or in Lewis\u2019s terms, an artistic\nvehicle. Instead, for Lewis, the aesthetic essence constitutive of the\nidentity of the work of art, as opposed to the physical object,\n\u201clies in the context associated with this physical\nentity which presents it\u201d (1946, 474, Lewis\u2019s\nitalics). Lewis holds that if the observer does not take this\nassociated context into account in the interpretation of the vehicle,\nthe work of art is misapprehended or not apprehended at all:\n\u201cwhatever the subject must bring to the presentation, in order\ncorrectly to understand the poem presented, belongs to the poem\u201d\n(1946, 474).\n\n\nNote that Lewis considers every aesthetic essence to be \u201can\nabstraction which theoretically could be identically presented by\nanother physical thing\u201d (1946, 476). Similar claims to the\neffect that all works of art are multiple, at least in principle and\nqua objects of appreciation, were subsequently made by Ushenko\n(1953, 21\u201325), Peter Strawson (1959, 231, n. 1; 1974, 183), Jeanne\nWacker (1960), Anthony Savile (1971), Eddie Zemach (1966, 1986), and\nCurrie (1989). \n\n\nMany other writers have, on the contrary, stressed the singularity of\nat least some works of art and/or some of their constituents.\nCroce\u2019s influential (1903) diatribe against the\n\u201cscience\u201d of genres stands at the top of a list that\nincludes George Boas (1937), Henri Focillon (1934, 56), Souriau (1947,\n70), Stuart Hampshire (1952), Ingarden (1962), Nelson Goodman (1968),\nRichard Wollheim (1968), Wolterstorff (1975, 1980), Catherine Lord\n(1977), Mark Sagoff (1978), E. J. Lowe (1983), Levinson (1987, 1996),\nG\u00e9rard Genette (1994), Anthony O\u2019Hear (1995), Irvin\n(2008), and Michael Weh (2010).\n\n\nThe diversity of arguments and positions on this broad particularist\ntheme should be noted. For example, Ingarden reacts negatively to the\nprospect of a multiplicity of perfect replicas of the cathedral of\nNotre Dame de Paris: seeing such things side by side, he comments,\nwould cause \u201cthe strongest displeasure, precisely because it\nbelongs to the nature of the work of art to be an individual, in the\nsense of something qualitatively unique\u201d (1989, 274; 1962,\n278). O\u2019Hear defends a \u201csingularity thesis\u201d to the\neffect that \u201cworks of distinction\u201d are necessarily\nindividual and unique, whereas Weh argues that artistic intentions\nconstrained by the historical circumstances determine whether and when\na work is reproducible or multiple. Wolterstorff\u2019s line on this\ntopic is that in the case of many paintings, the artist does not\nsettle on a set of properties that establish criteria for correctness\nof instances or \u201coccurrences\u201d of the work (1980,\n72). Genette maintains that the reproducibility of works of art is a\nmatter of an institutionally codified consensus based on a balance\nbetween means and needs (1994, 101).\n\n\nIn a paper published posthumously in 2001, Frank Sibley contends that\na \u201ctwo-directional pull\u201d is a pervasive feature of the\npractices and discourses of art, at least with regard to visual works\nof art such as the Mona Lisa. If a painting is a particular\nphysical object, the work of art referred to as the Mona Lisa\nmay or may not be a painting: \u201cPerhaps it both is and is not,\ncan be and need not be\u201d (2001, 272). We are interested in the\nunique physical object, yet we also find that a copy can serve many of\nthe same functions, including artistic and aesthetic ones. So either\nwe have two distinct concepts of works of this kind, or we have\ninherited what Sibley calls an \u201cuneasy composite or hybrid of\ntwo conflicting notions\u201d (2001, 272).\n",
