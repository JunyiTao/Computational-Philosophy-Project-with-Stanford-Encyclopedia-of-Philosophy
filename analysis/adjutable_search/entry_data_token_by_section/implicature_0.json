    "main_text": "Speaker Implicature\n1. Speaker Implicature\n\nH. P. Grice (1913\u20131988) was the first to systematically study\ncases in which what a speaker means differs from what the\nsentence used by the speaker means. Consider (1).\n\n(1)\nAlan: Are you going to Paul\u2019s party?\n\nBarb: I have to work.\n\n\nIf this was a typical exchange, Barb meant that she is not\ngoing to Paul\u2019s party by saying that she has to work.\nShe did not say that she is not going to Paul\u2019s party, and the\nsentence she uttered does not mean that. Grice introduced the\ntechnical terms implicate and implicature for the\ncase in which what the speaker said is distinct from what the speaker\nthereby meant or\n implied.[1]\n Thus Barb implicated that she is not going; that she is not going was\nher implicature.\n\nIn (2), Carla is a dispatcher in Denver, where it is sunny and dry.\nDon is a truck driver trying to get over the continental divide during\na blizzard.\n\n(2)\nCarla: How\u2019s the weather over there?\n\nDon: The weather\u2019s lovely.\n\n\nDon is using irony. He said that the weather is lovely, but he thereby\nmeant that the weather is terrible. So he implicated that the weather\nis terrible. Implicating is an illocutionary speech act,\nsomething done in or by saying something (Austin 1962: 98\u2013103).\nSince it involves meaning one thing by saying something else,\nit is an indirect speech act, albeit not one that Searle\n(1975: 265\u20136)\n analyzed.[2]\n\nBy \u201csaying\u201d, Grice meant not the mere utterance of words,\nbut saying that something is the case, which Austin (1962:\n94) called a locutionary act. Barb could have said the\nsame thing by uttering different words. As Grice realized,\n\u201csay\u201d is used more or less\n strictly.[3]\n Thus if Ed says \u201cThe largest planet is a gas giant\u201d, we\nwill sometimes count him as saying that Jupiter is a gas giant. We\nwill follow Grice in using \u201csay\u201d more narrowly, requiring\nthat what a speaker says be something that the sentence uttered means\nor expresses in the context of use. So we will take Ed to have\nimplicated that Jupiter is a gas giant by saying that the largest\nplanet is. Stating or asserting that p\nentails both saying and meaning that\n p.[4]\n When Yogi Berra, famous for his malapropisms, said \u201cTexas has a\nlot of electrical votes\u201d, he said that Texas has a lot of\nelectrical votes; but since that was not something he meant, it was\nnot something he asserted. Don did not mean what he said for a\ndifferent reason. So he too said but did not assert that the weather\nis lovely.\n\nIt is not possible to fully understand speakers without knowing what\nthey have implicated as well as what they have said. Unless we know\nwhat Barb meant by saying that she has to work, we will not know that\nshe has answered Alan\u2019s question. Unless Carla knows what Don\nmeant by saying that the weather is lovely, she might mistakenly infer\nthat he will arrive on time. The difference between saying and\nimplicating also affects how we evaluate speakers. If Barb knew she\ndid not have to work, then she was lying in dialogue\n (1).\n If she knew she was going to Paul\u2019s party, she might be guilty\nof misleading Alan, but not of lying or making a false\n statement.[5]\n In court, witnesses are typically required to answer questions\ndirectly. They cannot avoid perjury by implicating a falsehood rather\nthan saying it.\n\nWhat someone implicates is not given to us directly. We have to\ninfer it from evidence. We would typically infer in\n (1)\n that Barb meant she is not going from what she said, what Alan asked,\nour assumption that Barb was responding to Alan\u2019s question, and\nsome background knowledge (e.g., that going to Paul\u2019s party\nis not work). An implicature can be characterized as an inference\n(\u201csomething inferred\u201d), but implicating is not itself\ninferring. To implicate something is to express a belief in a\nparticular way. To infer something is to acquire or possess a belief\nin a particular way. Hearers have to infer what speakers implicate.\nBut implicatures do not result from inferences. \nFurthermore, the fact that implicatures are inferred is not what makes\nimplicating an indirect speech act. Implicature is indirect because to\nimplicate something is to mean it by saying something\nelse.\n\nEven though it requires an inference, our recognition of what is meant\nis commonly automatic and effortless, whether it is said or\nimplicated. In\n (1),\n for example, competent speakers will grasp immediately that Barb\nmeant both that she has to work and that she is not going to\nPaul\u2019s party. All speech acts have to be inferred from\ncontextual evidence, including what was said and what words were\nuttered. Whether there is any significant difference in the kind of\ninference required to recognize an implicature is a matter of some\ndebate, and may depend on the type of\n implicature.[6]\n While it is not our focus here, how competent hearers recognize---and\nlanguage learners acquire the ability to recognize---what a speaker\nimplicates is the subject of intensive experimentation and theorizing\nin the field of\n pragmatics.[7]\n\nGrice used his technical term \u201cimplicature\u201d for a way of\nexpressing a proposition by saying that something is the case. \nIt is also common to express propositions by asking questions or\nissuing imperatives (Geurts 2010: 32\u20133), to express attitudes and\nother things that are not propositions by saying something (Braun\n2011; Sullivan 2023: \u00a7V), and to express things by not saying\nsomething (Swanson 2017).  While these acts do not count as\nimplicature as Grice defined his technical term, and are not the focus\nof his theory (or this entry), they are similar in many important\nways.\n",
