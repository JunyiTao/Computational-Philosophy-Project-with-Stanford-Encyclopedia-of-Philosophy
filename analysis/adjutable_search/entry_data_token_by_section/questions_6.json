    "main_text": "The semantics of elementary questions || Inquisitive semantics\n2.3 Inquisitive semantics\n2.3.1 The basic system\n\nRecall from section 2.1.1 that a fundamental problem with the\nclassical semantic theories of Hamblin (1973) and Karttunen (1977) is\nthat they do not specify clear criteria for when a response should\ncount as a \u201cpossible answer\u201d. Partition semantics\n(Groenendijk and Stokhof 1984) does specify explicitly which responses\nshould count as possible answers, namely only those that are true and\nexhaustive. In many cases, it is clear what the true and exhaustive\nresponses to a given question are. However, this is not always the\ncase, as witnessed by conditional and alternative questions. A natural\nway to proceed, then, is to consider another criterion for what should\ncount as a possible answer.\n\nOne natural criterion is the following. We could say that a response\nto a question counts as a proper answer just in case it\nresolves the issue that the question raises. If we adopt this\ncriterion then we also have to impose a certain structural condition\non question-meanings. That is, question-meanings cannot just be\ndefined as arbitrary sets of propositions, as in the theories of\nHamblin (1973) and Karttunen (1977). Rather, they should be defined as\ndownward closed sets of propositions. That is, if a question\nmeaning contains a certain proposition \\(\\alpha\\), then it must also\ncontain all stronger propositions \\(\\beta \\subseteq \\alpha\\). After\nall, suppose that \\(\\alpha\\) is an element of the meaning of a\nquestion \\(Q\\). Given our answerhood criterion, this means that\n\\(\\alpha\\) corresponds to an issue-resolving response to \\(Q\\). But\nthen every \\(\\beta \\subseteq \\alpha\\) corresponds to an even more\ninformative, and therefore also issue-resolving response. So, given\nour answerhood criterion, \\(\\beta\\) must also be an element of the\nmeaning of \\(Q\\).\n\nThis conception of question meanings forms the cornerstone of the most\nbasic implementation of inquisitive semantics, the system\n\\(\\Inq_B\\) (Groenendijk and Roelofsen 2009, Ciardelli 2009, Ciardelli\nand Roelofsen 2011, Roelofsen 2013, Ciardelli 2016, Ciardelli et\nal. 2018). In this system, question meanings are defined as\ndownward closed sets of propositions that together cover the entire\nlogical\n space.[1]\n We will refer to such sets as inquisitive question\nmeanings.[2]\n\nPartitions correspond to a specific kind of inquisitive question\nmeanings. That is, for every partition \\(\\rP\\), there is a\ncorresponding inquisitive question meaning \\(I_{\\rP}\\), consisting of\nall propositions that are contained in one of the blocks in\n\\(\\rP\\):\n\n\\(I_{\\rP} : = \\{\\alpha \\subseteq \\beta \\mid \\beta \\in \\rP\\}\\) \n\nHowever, not every inquisitive question meaning corresponds to a\npartition. In fact, an inquisitive question meaning \\(I\\) corresponds\nto a partition if and only if for every subset \\(I'\\subseteq I\\) such\nthat \\(\\cap I'\\ne \\varnothing\\), \\(\\cup I'\\) is also in \\(I\\). There\nare many inquisitive question meanings that do not have this special\nproperty. Thus, the notion of question meanings in \\(\\Inq_B\\) is more\ngeneral than the notion of question meanings in partition\nsemantics.\n\nThe set of all meanings in \\(\\Inq_B\\), together with a suitable notion\nof entailment, form a Heyting algebra, just like the set of all\nmeanings in classical logic ordered by classical entailment (Roelofsen\n2013). Thus, the basic connectives (disjunction, conjunction,\nimplication, and negation) can be associated with the basic algebraic\noperations on meanings (join, meet, and (relative)\npseudo-complementation), just as in classical logic. This is indeed\nhow the connectives are treated in \\(\\Inq_B\\), although other\ntreatments of the connectives are also conceivable in this setting\n(see, e.g., Ciardelli et al. 2015).\n2.3.2 Some extensions\n\nIn recent work, the basic system sketched above has been extended in\nseveral directions. Below are pointers to some of these\nextensions.\n\nCiardelli et al. (2012) consider a notion of meaning that is\nvery much like the one adopted in \\(\\Inq_B\\), but also has a\npresuppositional component. Such a notion of meaning is\nneeded to suitably deal with alternative questions and\nwhich-questions.\n\nCiardelli et al. (2017) develop a type-theoretic inquisitive\nsemantics, which is needed for a compositional semantic analysis of\nquestions.\n\nRoelofsen and Farkas (2015) develop an inquisitive semantics in which\nthe meaning of a question does not only capture what is needed to\nresolve the issue raised by that question, but also which propositions\nare made available by the question for subsequent anaphoric reference.\nThese propositions may serve as antecedents for polarity particles\n(e.g. Is Paul coming? Yes/No ) and other anaphoric\nexpressions (e.g. Is Paul coming? Then/otherwise I\u2019ll make\npasta ).\n\nFarkas and Roelofsen (2017) integrate inquisitive semantics with a\ncommitment-based model of discourse, in order to capture the special\ndiscourse effects of non-canonical types of questions, such as\ntag-questions (Paul is coming, isn\u2019t he? ) and\ndeclarative questions (Paul is coming? ).\n\nFinally, Ciardelli and Roelofsen (2015), Ciardelli (2016), and van\nGessel (2016) develop a system that integrates inquisitive semantics\nwith dynamic epistemic logic (van Ditmarsch et al.\n2007), in order to formally model the information states and\ninquisitive states of the participants of a discourse, and how these\nstates change when a question is asked or a statement is made. It also\nprovides a semantics for question-embedding predicates like\n\u2018know\u2019 and \u2018wonder\u2019 (see also section 4).\n",
