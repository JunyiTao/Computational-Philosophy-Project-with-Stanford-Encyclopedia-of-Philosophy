    "main_text": "Moral Phenomenology and Metaethics || Moral judgment\n2.3 Moral judgment\n\nWe have seen in the preceding section that Phenomenologists understand\na feeling\u2019s or moral emotion\u2019s apprehension of a value as\ntied to the perception of an entity under a certain aspect or under a\ncertain description, for example, the boys\u2019 torturing the cat.\nThe moral emotion, in other words, apprehends the boys\u2019\ntorturing the cat as wrong. The as\u2014what\nPhenomenologists often call the \u201chermeneutic\nas\u201d\u2014demarcates the entity and the value-aspect\nunder which it is experienced. Focusing attention on the aspect or\ndescription under which the object is experienced, the subject\nrecognizes it as a feature of the object or as belonging to the object\nand, conversely, recognizes that the object is as described\nor has the feature in question. In short, the as\npoints to an is or a has; seeing the torturing\nas wrong points to the judgment that the torturing\nis wrong. It is the attending to the aspect and the explicit\nrecognition of it as an aspect that produces the judgment affirming\nthe relation between the entity and the aspect. The judgment thus\nintroduces a new sense beyond what is contained in the moral emotion.\nThere is an affirmation of the distinction between and the unity of\nthe entity and its aspect, that is, an explicit affirmation of the\nobject\u2019s being a certain way and as having value on the\nground of its being that way (Husserl 1900\u20131901 [2001:\n2:278\u2013280, 286\u2013289]). There is a shift from\nseeing the boys\u2019 wrongfully torturing the cat (that is,\nseeing their torturing the cat as wrong) to seeing\nthat the boys\u2019 torturing the cat is wrong. The\nshift is from an attributive mode of experience to a predicative one.\n(Husserl 1900\u20131901 [2001: 2:273]), and the boys torturing the\ncat is now explicitly brought under the concept\n\u201cwrong\u201d.\n\nOne question about the phenomenology of moral judgment is whether\nexperiences of making a moral judgment have a phenomenal essence in\nthe sense that there is some phenomenal property (or properties) that\nsuch experiences have in common and that serves to distinguish them\nfrom experiences of making non-moral judgments. Mandelbaum, whose work\nin ethics links the Phenomenological and analytic traditions, defended\nthis kind of essentialism. As noted earlier, he drew a\nphenomenological distinction between \u201cdirect\u201d moral\nexperiences of obligation and \u201cremoved\u201d moral experiences.\nThe former type is where one judges that one is morally obligated to\neither do or refrain from performing an action that is called for in\none\u2019s immediate circumstances. Mandelbaum describes this\nphenomenon as involving a \u201creflexive felt demand\u201d\nemanating from one\u2019s immediate circumstances (rather than from\none\u2019s antecedent preferences) directed toward oneself and\ngrounded in one\u2019s sense of a particular response best fitting\nthe circumstances. Because the source of the felt demand is\none\u2019s circumstances and not one\u2019s preferences, judgments\ngrounded in this kind of demand are experienced as objective. Removed\nmoral judgments, by contrast, are of two sorts and include judgments\nof obligation about one\u2019s past self and about others, as well as\njudgments about the goodness and badness of character traits (virtues\nand vices). Supposing that direct and removed kinds of moral\nexperience exhaust the realm of judgment-involving moral experiences,\nthe question is whether there is something essential to all such\nexperiences that unifies and distinguishes them from experiences\ninvolving non-moral judgments.\n\nMandelbaum argued that\n\n\nall moral judgments are grounded in our apprehension of relations of\nfittingness or unfittingness between the responses of a human being\nand the demands which inhere in the situation by which he is\nfaced.\n\n\nThey constitute, as he says, a \u201csingle genus\u201d\n(1955: 181). He thus apparently thought that the realm of\njudgment-involving moral experiences enjoys a phenomenological\nsignature\u2014an essence. Of course, even if Mandelbaum is mistaken\nabout the entire range of judgment-involving moral experiences, it\nmight be true that, for example, direct moral experiences enjoy a\nphenomenal essence. For recent discussions of Mandelbaum on this issue\nof essence, see Horgan and Timmons 2005, 2008a; Gill 2008;\nSinnott-Armstrong 2008; and Glasgow 2013.\n\nMandelbaum considered his phenomenological approach to moral\ntheorizing crucial for uncovering universally correct moral norms\nwithout begging questions for or against competing views about such\nnorms. His phenomenological description as of direct moral obligations\ncoming from one\u2019s external circumstances as opposed to being\nexperienced as grounded in one\u2019s desires and aversions, favored\nsome form of moral\n realism.[17]\n Mandelbaum also took his phenomenological inquiry to favor a\ndeontological normative ethical theory, about which we say more below\nin\n section 3.\n",
