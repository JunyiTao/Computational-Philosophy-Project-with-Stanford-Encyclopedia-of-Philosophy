Many have suggested a closer look\nat real-world inferential practices in the sciences as a more\nappropriate benchmark for assessment. For one thing, the very idea of\nhypothetico-deductivism has often been said to stem from the origins\nof Western science. As reported by Simplicius of Cilicia (sixth\ncentury A.D.) in his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s De\nCaelo, Plato had challenged his pupils to identify combinations\nof \u201cordered\u201d motions by which one could account for\n(namely, deduce) the planets\u2019 wandering trajectories across the\nheavens as observed by the Earth. As a matter of historical fact,\nmathematical astronomy has engaged in just this task for centuries:\nscholars have been trying to define geometrical models from which the\napparent motion of celestial bodies would derive.\n\nIt is fair to say that, at its roots, the kind of challenges that the\nHD framework faces with scientific reasoning is not so different from\nthe main puzzles that arise from philosophical considerations of a\nmore formal kind. Still, the two areas turn out to be complementary in\nimportant ways. The following statement will serve as a useful\nstarting point to extend the scope of our discussion.\n\nUnderdetermination Theorem (UT) for\n\u201cna\u00efve\u201d HD-confirmation\nFor any contingent \\(h, e \\in \\bL\\), if \\(h\\) and \\(e\\) are logically\nconsistent, there exists some \\(k \\in \\bL\\) such that \\(e\\)\nHD-confirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\). \n\n(UT) is an elementary logical fact that has been long recognized (see,\ne.g., Glymour 1980a, 36). In purely formal terms, just positing \\(k =\nh \\rightarrow e\\) will do for a proof. To appreciate how (UT) can\nspark any philosophical interest, one has to combine it with some\ninsightful remarks first put forward by Pierre Duhem (1906) and then\nfamously revived by Quine (1951) in a more radical style. (Indeed,\n(UT) essentially amounts to the \u201centailment version\u201d of\n\u201cQuinean underdetermination\u201d in Laudan 1990, 274.)\n\nDuhem (he himself a supporter of the HD view) pointed out that in\nmature sciences such as physics most hypotheses or theories of real\ninterest can not be contradicted by any statement describing\nobservable states of affairs. Taken in isolation, they simply do not\nlogically imply, nor rule out, any observable fact, essentially\nbecause (unlike \u201call ravens are black\u201d) they involve the\nmention of unobservable entities and processes. So, in effect, Duhem\nemphasized that, typically, scientific hypotheses or theories\nare logically consistent with any piece of checkable\nevidence. Unless, of course, the logical connection is underpinned by\nauxiliary hypotheses and assumptions suitably bridging the gap between\nthe observational and non-observational vocabulary, as it were. But\nthen, once auxiliaries are in play, logic alone guarantees that\nsome \\(k\\) exists such that \\(h\\wedge k\\) is consistent,\n\\(h\\wedge k \\vDash e\\), and \\(k \\not\\vDash e\\), so that confirmation\nholds in na\u00efve HD terms (that\u2019s just the UT result above).\nApparently, when Duhem\u2019s point applies, the uncritical supporter\nof whatever hypothesis \\(h\\) can legitimately claim (na\u00efve HD)\nconfirmation from any \\(e\\) by simply shaping \\(k\\) conveniently. In\nthis sense, hypothesis assessment would be radically\n\u201cunderdetermined\u201d by any amount of evidence practically\navailable.\n\nInfluential authors such as Thomas Kuhn (1962/1970) (but see Laudan\n1990, 268, for a more extensive survey) relied on Duhemian insights to\nsuggest that confirmation by empirical evidence is too weak a force to\ndrive the evaluation of theories in science, often inviting\nconclusions of a relativistic flavor (see Worrall 1996 for an\nilluminating reconstruction along these lines). Let us briefly\nconsider a classical case, which Duhem himself thoroughly analyzed:\nthe wave vs. particle theories of light in modern optics.\nAcross the decades, wave theorists were able to deduce an impressive\nlist of important empirical facts from their main hypothesis along\nwith appropriate auxiliaries, diffraction phenomena being only one\nmajor example. But many particle theorists\u2019 reaction was to\nretain their hypothesis nonetheless and to reshape other\nparts of the \u201ctheoretical maze\u201d (i.e., \\(k\\); the term is\nPopper\u2019s, 1963, p. 330) to recover those observed facts as\nconsequences of their own proposal. And as we\u2019ve seen,\nif the bare logic of na\u00efve HD was to be taken strictly,\nsurely they could have claimed their overall hypothesis to be\nconfirmed too, just as much as their opponents.\n\nImportantly, they didn\u2019t. In fact, it was quite clear that\nparticle theorists, unlike their wave-theory opponents, were striving\nto remedy weaknesses rather than scoring successes (see Worrall 1990).\nBut why, then? Because, as Duhem himself clearly realized, the logic\nof na\u00efve HD \u201cis not the only rule for our judgments\u201d\n(1906, 217). The lesson of (UT) and the Duhemian insight is not quite,\nit seems, that na\u00efve HD is the last word and scientific inference\nis unconstrained by stringent rational principles, but rather that the\nHD view has to be strengthened in order to capture the real nature of\nevidential support in rational scientific inference. At least,\nthat\u2019s the position of a good deal of philosophers of science\nworking within the HD framework broadly construed. It has even been\nmaintained that \u201cno serious twentieth-century\nmethodologist\u201d has ever subscribed to the na\u00efve HD view\nabove \u201cwithout crucial qualifications\u201d (Laudan 1990, 278;\nalso see Laudan and Leplin 1991, 466).\n\nSo the HD approach to confirmation has yielded a number of more\narticulated variants to meet the challenge of underdetermination.\nFollowing (loosely) Norton (2005), we will now survey an instructive\nsample of them.\n",
