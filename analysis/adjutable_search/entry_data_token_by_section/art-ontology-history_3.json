    "main_text": "Do works of art exist? || The Imagination and fictionalism\n1.3 The Imagination and fictionalism\n\n\nIn attributing artistic and aesthetic modes of existence to works,\nGilson adverted to a physical object\u2019s relation to the\nexperiences and actions of cognizing subjects. Similarly, a long\nseries of philosophers have taken subjective relations and experiences\nto be crucial to answering the question of the existence of works of\nart. It has often been proposed, for example, that works are at least\nin part a product of the imagination, and this not merely in the sense\nthat some artist must imagine what sort of thing he or she wants to\nmake or do if a work of art is to be brought into existence.  Instead,\nthe thought is that even the existence or reality of a completed work\nof art continues to depend on the make-believe or imaginative activity\nof the artist or some other subject, such as the observer or reader\nwho appreciates the work as a work of art.\n\n\nThat the imagination plays a crucial role in aesthetic responses to\nboth art and nature was an important theme in 18th-century\naesthetics (see the entries on French, British, and German aesthetics\nin the 18th century).  Joseph Addison\u2019s (1712)\ndescription of the \u201cpleasures of the imagination\u201d was\ninfluential, yet not as influential perhaps as Immanuel Kant\u2019s\nidea that the activation of the power or faculty of the imagination\nwas essential to aesthetic judgments (for more detail, see the entry\non Kant\u2019s aesthetics). In the 19th and\n20th centuries, various thinkers contended that the\nimagination plays a crucial role in both the creation and the\nreception of works of art. Prominent examples of philosophers who\nemphasized the importance of Einbildungskraft\nor Phantasie in this regard include Friedrich Theodor Vischer\n(1857, 1898), Robert Zimmermann (1865), Hermann Lotze (1884), Eduard\nvon Hartmann (1888), Karl K\u00f6stlin (1869, 1889), Konrad von Lange\n(1895, 1901, 1912, 1935), Christian von Ehrenfels (1896\u20131899,\n318), and Johannes Volkelt (1905\u20131915).\n\n\nVon Hartmann (1888, vol. 2, 11) rejects what he called\n\u201cna\u00efve realistic\u201d assumptions about the objects of\naesthetic or artistic judgements. Arguing for a \u201ctranscendental\nrealism,\u201d he contends that beauty is not a material object, but\na subjective appearance, like the sweetness of sugar.  Von Hartmann\nobserves that people confidently say such things as \u201cthis book\nis Homer\u2019s Iliad,\u201d \u201cthis score is Beethoven\u2019s\nNinth Symphony,\u201d and \u201cthis painting is\nRaphael\u2019s Sistine Madonna.\u201d Although it is often\nacknowledged that the first two examples are philosophically\nuntenable, it ought to be admitted, von Hartmann contends, that the\nthird sort of statement is also inaccurate. The painted surface in\nitself is not beautiful even though in some circumstances it has the\ncapacity to contribute to a subjective appearance of beauty, which von\nHartmann characterizes as Schein or Phantasie. If\nthe work of art is the bearer or locus of beauty and other\naesthetic properties, it cannot be the material object in itself. Yet\nHartmann also contests what he called \u201csubjective\nidealism,\u201d and in his discussion of artistic creation emphasizes\nthe artist\u2019s engagement with the material constraints of artistic\nmedia. The \u201cphantasy work\u201d that an artist elaborates prior\nto the creation of an \u201cexternal work of art\u201d is never\nneutral with regard to media or instrumentation (1888, vol. 2,\n180).\n\n\nKonrad von Lange held that imaginative play and an attitude he called\n\u2018conscious self-deception\u2019 [die bewusste\nSelbstt\u00e4uschung] are necessary to both the creation and\nappreciation of art. He did not explicitly draw the conclusion that\nworks of art are therefore fictions, but he did describe our commerce\nwith them as a kind of lucid illusion in which we playfully entertain\nthoughts of states of affairs that we know not to exist. The artistic\nartifact, he proposed, is like the toy or other object that is\nrecruited to the ends of a child\u2019s imaginative play. A sophisticated\nand highly influential contemporary exponent of this kind of approach\nto art and, more specifically, to the philosophical analysis of\ndepiction and fictional content, is Kendall L. Walton (1990).\n\n\nJean-Paul Sartre (1938, 1940) has often been credited with the idea\nthat works of art are illusory (in the sense of systematically being\nthe object of some sort of error about their mode of existence), but\nit is not obvious that this is the best interpretation of his remarks\non the topic. Sartre declares that Beethoven\u2019s Seventh Symphony\n\u201cis outside of the real, outside of existence\u201d\n(1940, 371, my trans.). He also says that we do not really hear the\nsymphony at all, but only hear the composition in our imaginations.\nSuch statements can be read as being meant to debunk a widespread\nillusory belief in the existence of musical works; they also hold open\nthe possibility of imagining works without believing in their\nexistence, in which case the putative illusion is not necessary.  One\nof the possible targets of Sartre\u2019s remarks is a kind of idealist\ndoctrine discussed below. For an informative discussion of Sartre\u2019s\nviews on the subject, see Peter V. Lamarque (2010, chapter 10); and\nfor additional background, see the entry on existentialist\naesthetics.\n\n\nOn this topic Sartre was preceded and possibly influenced by Ingarden\nand Nicolai Hartmann, who was professor of theoretical philosophy in\nBerlin at the time of Sartre\u2019s stint at the Institut\nfran\u00e7ais in Berlin from 1933\u20131934. In a paper\npresented at the International Congress of Philosophy held at Harvard\nin 1926 and published in 1927, Hartmann contrasted psychological and\nontological approaches in aesthetics and argued for the priority of\nthe latter. In this paper he outlined positions that he was to develop\nat length in a series of works, including his (1933) and an unfinished\ntreatise on aesthetics, written in 1945 and published posthumously in\n1953.\n\n\nHartmann\u2019s central thesis on the ontology of art is that works\nare fictions that depend upon the perceptual and imaginative\nactivities of artists and their audiences. In Hartmann\u2019s view,\nthe work of art has at least two parts or strata: the first layer,\nwhich he sometimes refers to as the \u201cforeground,\u201d is\nperceptible\u2014Hartmann\u2019s examples include a piece of stone,\ncolors on a surface, and audible sounds. The perception of such items\nis the basis of the aesthetic experience of the higher\n\u201cbackground\u201d stratum, which also requires imaginings\noccasioned by this perceptual experience. The artistic and aesthetic\nqualities of the work arise from the relation between these\n\u2018heterogeneous\u2019 levels. Hartmann\u2019s discussion of the\nartwork\u2019s strata resembles some of the claims made by\nIngarden. It would appear that the two philosophers arrived at these\nresults independently; for a comparison of their positions, see\nWolfgang Ruttkowski (1990).\n\n\nHartmann maintains that as a result of its dependence upon the\nimagination, the work of art lacks independent or autonomous being, or\nwhat he calls \u2018Ansichsein\u2019. A work is an\nobserver-relative appearance or Erscheinung, experienced as\nsuch. An appearance experienced as appearance is not to be\nconfused, however, with illusion or Schein because it\ninvolves self-reflexive awareness that something is being imagined as\nopposed to believed. In this regard Hartmann evokes the familiar\nanalogy to children\u2019s imaginative play, while commenting that\nfor the adult such play \u201cremains fiction\u201d (1953, 53).\n\n\nHartmann\u2019s concept of artistic appearance does not embrace\nonly the depictive or symbolic contents of representational works of\nart, as Hartmann also applies his levels analysis to the aesthetic\nproperties of non-figurative works, including architectural ones.\nA building qua material object obviously figures amongst the\nreal entities of the world, but to experience the material building as\na work of art is to engage in the imaginative apprehension of fictional\nqualities. Hartmann appears to be claiming in this regard that\nsuch terms as \u2018grandiose\u2019, \u2018pompous\u2019 or\n\u2018majestic\u2019, are, when used as labels to name the aesthetic\nqualities of a building, in some sense imaginative and hence\nfictional.\n\n\nKindred approaches to the question of the work\u2019s existence\nhave been developed by a number of different figures, an early instance\nbeing the American philosopher Stephen C. Pepper, who describes how the\nimagination contributes to a process in which \u201can aesthetic work\nof art is created out of a physical work of art\u201d (1937a, 231;\n1955). Pepper, who was a professor of philosophy at the\nUniversity of California at Berkeley, was on the same panel as Hartmann\nat the 1926 Congress mentioned above. It is not clear, however,\nwhether Pepper embraced Hartmann\u2019s conclusion that works of art\nare in some sense fictions. Pepper argued for a relativist\nconception whereby ontological issues depend ultimately on such\noverarching rival frameworks as organicism, mechanism, and pragmatism\nor \u201ccontextualism.\u201d Pepper explicitly denied that any\none of these frameworks was the one true theory.\n\n\nAnother philosopher whose early contributions merit attention in\nthis vein is Joseph Margolis (1958, 1959, 1961). Margolis\ndescribes a work of art as being comprised of a physical system (for\nexample, a lump of clay) and an aesthetic design. To behold\nsomething as a work of art, it is necessary to combine a sensory\nperception of the physical item with an imaginative experience of the\naesthetic design. The design \u201csupervenes\u201d upon the\nphysical system. Margolis suggests that whereas contradictory\nassertions about a physical object cannot both be true, the principle\nof noncontradiction does not apply to the description of works of\nart.\n",
