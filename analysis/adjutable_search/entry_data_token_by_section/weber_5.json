    "main_text": "History || Calculability, Predictability, and World-Mastery\n3.2 Calculability, Predictability, and World-Mastery\n\nRoughly put, taking place in all areas of human life from religion and\nlaw to music and architecture, rationalization means a historical\ndrive towards a world in which \u201cone can, in principle, master\nall things by calculation\u201d [Weber 1919/1946, 139]. For instance,\nmodern capitalism is a rational mode of economic life because it\ndepends on a calculable process of production. This search for exact\ncalculability underpins such institutional innovations as monetary\naccounting (especially double-entry bookkeeping), centralization of\nproduction control, separation of workers from the means of\nproduction, supply of formally free labour, disciplined control on the\nfactory floor, and other features that make modern capitalism\nqualitatively different from all other modes of organizing\neconomic life. The enhanced calculability of the production process is\nalso buttressed by that in non-economic spheres such as law and\nadministration. Legal formalism and bureaucratic management reinforce\nthe elements of predictability in the sociopolitical environment that\nencumbers industrial capitalism by means of introducing formal\nequality of citizenship, a rule-bound legislation of legal norms, an\nautonomous judiciary, and a depoliticized professional bureaucracy.\nFurther, all this calculability and predictability in political,\nsocial, and economic spheres was not possible without changes of\nvalues in ethics, religion, psychology, and culture. Institutional\nrationalization was, in other words, predicated upon the rise of a\npeculiarly rational type of personality, or a \u201cperson of\nvocation\u201d (Berufsmensch) as outlined in the\nProtestant Ethic. The outcome of this complex interplay of\nideas and interests was modern rational Western civilization with its\nenormous material and cultural capacity for relentless\nworld-mastery.\n",
