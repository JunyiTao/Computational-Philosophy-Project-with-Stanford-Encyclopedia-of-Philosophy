    "main_text": "Ancient and Modern Skepticism: Transitions || Subjectivity, and Other Minds\n5.4 External World Skepticism\n\nIn its early modern versions, external world skepticism involves the\nidea that there is a creator\u2014someone who made the world and our\nfaculties, and the fit or misfit between them. If this assumption is\ncrucial to external world skepticism, then the ancients do not\nconceive of this skeptical problem. From the point of view of modern\nphilosophy, ancient skepticism may appear limited by not addressing\nsome of the most radical skeptical scenarios (Burnyeat 1980 [1997] and\n1982; Williams 1988; Fine 2003a and 2003b). From the point of view of\nancient skepticism, early modern skepticism and the long life that its\nproblems enjoy, however, would seem to originate in a flawed\ntheology.\n\nContemporary philosophers sometimes discuss external world skepticism\nin terms of a paradox: one thinker finds herself torn between the\nstrength of skeptical arguments and her ordinary convictions. For\nexample, she thinks that this is her hand. But she concedes\nthat the skeptical hypothesis that a mad scientist might have set\nthings up so that she has such perceptions and thoughts (the so-called\nbrain in a vat scenario) is hard to refute. This way of framing\ndiscussions of skepticism is foreign to antiquity. In antiquity,\nskeptics and their opponents are different thinkers, each of them with\none set of intuitions, arguing against each other. It is also foreign\nto ancient skepticism insofar as it inherits the early modern idea\nthat some greatly powerful agent sets things up, and in a sense\ncreates the thinker\u2019s faculties and the world as it appears to\nthem.\n\nHowever, the ancient skeptics might conceive of their own kind of\nexternal world skepticism. One way to explore this question is to turn\nto the way in which Sextus describes that which is outside of the\nskeptic\u2019s mind (Fine 2003 and 2003(2)). Throughout his work,\nSextus employs the distinction between appearances and what really is\nthe case. Consider some of the detail of how he characterizes the\nlatter. One phrase in the Ten Modes is \u201cta ektos\nhupokeimena,\u201d the externally underlying things\n(PH 1.61, 127, 128, 134, 144). Other phrases, meant to\ndemarcate roughly the same contrast with appearances, are how things\nare in their nature (phusei) (PH 1.78, 123, 140),\n\u201cthe underlying things\u201d (hupokeimena)\n(PH 1.106), as well as a combination: \u201cthe nature of\nthe underlying external things\u201d (PH 1.117, 163). The\nexpressions which contain the word \u201cexternal\u201d might read\nas if Sextus was talking about the external world in a sense familiar\nto us from early modern skepticism.\n\nBut what are the underlying or external objects, as Sextus conceives\nof them? For example, Sextus speaks of the underlying reality of\nwhether honey really is sweet (PH 1.19). In such a case, it\nis assumed that there are ordinary objects. But we do not have access\nto the properties they really have (Fine calls this Property\nSkepticism, 2003b). However, external objects in Sextus\u2019 sense\nalso include objects that later philosophers would not obviously see\nas part of the external word. For example, an answer to the question\nof what kind of life really is good would count as a claim about\nexternal or underlying reality (cf. Pellegrin 2010).\n\nAnother approach to the question of whether Sextus envisages some kind\nof external world skepticism is to turn to his discussions of physics.\nOrdinarily we take ourselves to live in a world in which there are\nbodies, movement, place, time, and so on. But as Sextus argues, we do\nnot have compelling accounts of any of these core conceptions of\nphysics. This leads to suspension of judgment on whether there are\nbodies, movement, place, time, and so on. Sextus\u2019 discussions of\nphysics might add up to a rather far-reaching skepticism about the\nnatural world.\n",
