    "main_text": "Central Features of the Common Good || A Solidaristic Concern\n4.4 A Solidaristic Concern\n\nMost conceptions of the common good define a form of practical\nreasoning that fits the model of solidarity. Many social relationships\nrequire a form of solidarity among those who stand in the\nrelationship. Solidarity here basically involves one person giving a\ncertain subset of the interests of another person a status in her\nreasoning that is analogous to the status that she gives to her own\ninterests in her reasoning (see, e.g., Aristotle NE\n1166a1\u201333). For example, if my friend needs a place to sleep\ntonight, friendship requires that I should offer him my couch. I have\nto do this because friendship requires that I reason about events that\naffect my friend\u2019s basic interests as if these events were\naffecting my own basic interests in a similar way. A conception of the\ncommon good typically requires citizens to maintain certain facilities\nbecause these facilities serve certain common interests. So when\ncitizens reason as the conception requires, they effectively give the\ninterests of their fellow citizens a status in their reasoning that is\nanalogous to the status that they give to their own interests in their\nreasoning.\n\nAn example will make the idea more intuitive. According to Rousseau, a\nproperly ordered political community is \u201ca form of association\nthat will defend and protect the person and goods of each associate\nwith the full common force\u201d (1762b [1997: 49]). Citizens in this\ncommunity are united by a solidaristic form of mutual concern that is\nfocused on (among other things) their common interests in physical security and property.\nThis form of mutual concern requires each citizen to respond to an\nattack on the body or property of a fellow citizen as if this were an\nattack on her own body and property. When extended over all members,\nthis form of mutual concern requires the whole community to respond to\nan attack on any individual member as if this were an attack on every\nmember. In this sense, \u201cthe full common force\u201d stands\nbehind each person\u2019s physical security and property. Or, as\nRousseau sometimes puts it, \u201cone cannot injure one of the\nmembers without attacking the body, and still less can one injure the\nbody without the members being affected\u201d (1762b [1997:\n 52]).[12]\n",
