    "main_text": "The Modal-Existential Analysis of Dependence || Some Problems for the Modal-Existential Analysis\n2.2 Some Problems for the Modal-Existential Analysis\n\nAn important group of problems for the modal-existential analysis of\nontological dependence emerges from essential properties (at least if\nthey are considered as distinct from modal properties, as argued in\nFine 1994a). What could be a plausible example of an essential\nproperty of an individual object, say, Socrates? Let us assume that\nproperties are to be conceived of as property instances, such\nas the particular redness of a certain apple. Of course, an apple can\nchange its color, so that this is not an example of an\nessential property of the apple. But what about\u2014in the\ncase of Socrates\u2014his humanity (as it were, his\nparticular being human)? Certainly, if there is such a thing\nas the particular humanity of Socrates, he cannot lose it without\nceasing to exist. Perhaps we can deny that Socrates\u2019s particular\nhumanity is anything distinct from Socrates himself: after\nall, its existence necessarily coincides with his. Properties are\ncommonly said to depend for their existence upon the entities that\npossess them. One might propose to state this in the form of a\nprinciple, with the help of\n (EDR),\n as follows:\n\n(PROP-DEP)\nIf x is a property and y is an entity possessing\nx, then x dependsR for its existence upon\ny.\n\n\nNow, substituting the definiens of (EDR) into (PROP-DEP) gives us:\n\n(PROP-NEC)\n If x is a property and y is an entity possessing\nx, then, necessarily, x exists only if y\nexists.\n\n\nNote that (PROP-NEC) is not intended to apply to properties understood\nas universals, but only to particularized properties (otherwise\nvariously known as property instances, individual accidents, tropes,\nor modes). These are items exactly like the particular redness of a\nparticular apple mentioned above, conceived of as an object distinct\nfrom the redness of any other apple, no matter how well\nmatched in color to the first. On this interpretation, (PROP-NEC) has\nsome plausibility, complying as it does with the intuition that\nparticularized properties cannot \u201cmigrate\u201d from one object\nto another. (Actually, (PROP-NEC) itself does not quite imply this,\nalthough it does imply that a particularized property cannot migrate\nfrom one object to another when the first object ceases to exist.\nHere, the friend of an essentialist analysis of dependence has some\nfurther options, i.e., one could say that it is part of the nature or\nessence of a particularized property to be instantiated by the very\nobject that it is instantiated by. But we will leave this aside for\nnow.)\n\nA line of argument that could be developed on this basis suggests that\nif indeed there are such things as essential particularized properties\nthat are \u201cpossessed\u201d by composite objects, then they are\nin fact to be identified with those objects. But it would be\nvery problematic, quite generally, to argue that wherever items\nx and y are mutually existentially dependent as defined\nby\n (EDR),\n they are identical. For instance, consider the relationship between\nSocrates and the temporally extended event or process that was his\nlife. Clearly, in terms of (EDR), Socrates\u2019s life\ndependsR for its existence upon Socrates\u2014but so,\nplausibly, does his existence upon it: it is, for Socrates, what we\nmight call an inalienable event. And yet there are things\ntrue of the life of Socrates that are not true of him and vice\nversa (for example, that it was so many years long, and that he\nweighed so many pounds)\u2014so there is no question of their being\nidentical. Even more strikingly, if we assume that numbers are\nnecessary existents, and hence mutually existentially dependent, this\nline of thought would seem to entail that any two numbers are\nidentical!\n\nBut it could be disputed whether Socrates is existentially\ndependentR upon his life\u2014whether he\nnecessarily would not have existed if it had not\u2014for it\nmay be urged that he might have had or led a different life.\nNow, it is true enough that his life might have been\nqualitatively different in many ways, but what is currently\nat issue is whether he might have had a numerically different\nlife\u2014and it is hard, perhaps, to see how he could. For if it is\naccepted that lives dependR for their existence\nupon the persons whose lives they are, then, necessarily,\nx\u2019s life exists only if x exists. Suppose, for the\nsake of argument, that Socrates could have had a numerically different\nlife: then it would still have been a life which could only have been\nSocrates\u2019s\u2014no one other than Socrates could have had that\n\u201cother\u201d life. But then what could underpin the supposition\nthat it is indeed a life \u201cother\u201d than the life he actually\nhad (except qualitatively)? Other possible worlds clearly do contain\nlives that do not exist in the actual world, insofar as they contain\npeople who do not exist in the actual world: but there seem\nto be no strong grounds to suppose that they do so other than for that\nreason. It seems thus that there are certain difficult questions which\nthe modal-existential analysis may not fully address, at least not in\nthe form that we have presented it until now. We will continue to\ndiscuss these issues in\n \u00a73\n and\n \u00a74.\n",
