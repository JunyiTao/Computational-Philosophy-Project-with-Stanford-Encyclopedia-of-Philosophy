    "main_text": "The moral issue\n2. The moral issue\n\nCan terrorism be morally justified? There is no single answer to this\nquestion, as there is no single conception of what terrorism is. If we\nput aside definitions that depart too much, and for no compelling\nreason, from the core meaning of \u201cterrorism\u201d (such as\nthose cited in 1.2.3), we still need to decide whether the question\nassumes a wide or a narrow understanding of terrorism. A narrow\nconception of terrorism seems to be better suited to ethical\ninvestigation (1.2.2). Moreover, philosophers who work with a wide\ndefinition typically hold that terrorism that targets non-combatants\nor innocent persons is much more difficult to justify than\n\u201cselective\u201d terrorism which attacks only those who cannot\nplausibly claim innocence of the injustice or oppression at issue (and\nwhich accordingly does not count as \u201cterrorism\u201d on a\nnarrow definition of the term). The present discussion therefore\nfocuses on terrorism understood as violence against innocent civilians\nor common citizens, intended to intimidate and thereby to achieve some\nfurther (political) objective or, more broadly, to coerce.\n\nOne might try to justify some acts or campaigns of violence of this\nkind in two ways. One could argue that the victims may be\nnon-combatants or common citizens, but nevertheless are not innocent\nof the wrongs the terrorists are fighting against. Alternatively, one\ncould concede the innocence of the victims and argue that attacks on\nthem are nevertheless justified, either by their consequences on\nbalance, or by some deontological considerations.\n",
