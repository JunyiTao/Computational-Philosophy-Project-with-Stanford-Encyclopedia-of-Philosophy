Philosophy as a Rigorous Science and the Rise of Scientific Psychology\n\nA central principle of Brentano\u2019s philosophy, which should\nbecome widely accepted among Brentano\u2019s students, was that\nphilosophy should be done in a rigorous, scientific manner. Already\nearly in his career, in the public defense of his\nHabilitation in 1866, he stated 25 theses, the fourth of\nwhich reads: \u201cThe true method of philosophy is that of natural\nscience.\u201d (contained in: ZP, 136, my translation)\n[\u201cVerae philosophiae methodus nihil alia est nisi scientiae\nnaturarum\u201d]. Brentano, thus, opposed the idea that there\nwas a unique method for philosophy and denied that there was a\n\u201cfirst philosophy\u201d that could unveil genuinely\nphilosophical truths and thus play a privileged or foundational role\nin the overall system of the sciences. According to Brentano,\nphilosophy\u2014and in particular philosophical\npsychology\u2014should apply a method that is based on observation,\ndescription of facts, and induction; just like the (other) natural\nsciences.\n\nIt has been suggested that Brentano\u2019s fourth\nHabilitations-thesis makes him an advocate of a particular\nversion of the unity of the sciences, according to which there is a\nunity of method (cf. Haller 1993, 27) and that it stands in contrast\nto \u201cDilthey\u2019s view according to which the so-called\nGeisteswissenschaften or human or moral sciences would\nsomehow call for a special method of \u2018understanding\u2019 or\nVerstehen, as opposed to the \u2018explanation\u2019 of the\nnatural sciences.\u201d (Smith 1994, 31). One has to be cautious not\nto overstate this point, though. While it is true that Brentano uses\nboth the terms \u201cmethod\u201d [methodus] and\n\u201cnatural science\u201d [scientiae naturarum] in the\nsingular, there is strong evidence that he had a minimal understanding\nof what this method should exactly consist in. He never suggested that\nall scientific disciplines could be reduced to other, more basic\ndisciplines, nor did he argue that all natural sciences should apply\nexactly the same method, nor that mathematization or the use of a\nformal language was indispensable for scientificity. For Brentano, a\nmethod counts as scientific as long as it fulfills the minimal\nrequirements of applying observation, description of facts, and\ninduction. The specific methodological procedures applied in a given\nscientific discipline depend first and foremost on the objects\nstudied:\n\n\u201cNatural science, thus, requires in no way [...] that we should\nproceed everywhere in the same manner and in the way we do in the\nsimplest cases of mechanics. On the contrary, it teaches and instructs\nus to change our procedure [Verfahren] in accordance with the\nparticular nature of the objects\u201d (ZP, 35, my\ntranslation).\n\n[\u201cDie Naturwissenschaft verlangt also keineswegs, [...]\nda\u00df wir \u00fcberall gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig und so, wie in den\neinfachsten F\u00e4llen der Mechanik vorgehen sollen. Im Gegenteil,\nsie unterweist uns und \u00fcbt uns darauf ein, der besonderen Natur\nder Gegenst\u00e4nde entsprechend unser Verfahren zu\n\u00e4ndern\u201d]\n\n\nRegarding formal methods he states: \u201cMathematical analysis,\nwhich is the main means of scientific progress in some areas of\nnatural science, does not play nearly any role at all in\nothers.\u201d (ZK 35, my translation) [\u201cDie\nmathematische Analyse, die auf manchem Gebiet der Naturwissenschaft\ndas haupts\u00e4chliche Mittel des Fortschritt ist, spielt darum\nbekanntlich auf anderen so gut wie gar keine Rolle.\u201d]\nBrentano has never made an attempt to introduce formal or mathematical\nmethods in philosophy or psychology. On the contrary, he criticized\nJohann Friedrich Herbart\u2019s attempts to mathematize psychology,\npointing out that Herbart\u2019s mathematical deductions lack\nempirical foundation and therefore lose contact to the actual\nphenomena (cf. LW, 36). In another place where he discusses\nHerbart\u2019s position, he states: \u201cAlas, many believed that\nwhere there is so much mathematical rigour, there must be exact\nscience\u201d (GA, 53f, my translation). [\u201cLeider\nmeinten viele, wo so viel mathematische Strenge zu finden sei,\nm\u00fcsse exakte Wissenschaft gegeben sein.\u201d] For\nBrentano, any rigorous, scientific method had to be appropriate for\nthe observed phenomena; his position, thus, is closer to classical\nempiricism and positivism than to the logical positivism as it was\ndeveloped in Vienna a decade after his death.\n\nBrentano\u2019s views concerning the right method in philosophy was\nof particular importance to his contributions to psychology, as\nalready the title of his main work, Psychology from an Empirical\nStandpoint suggests. Also there he argued that the right\nprocedure consisted in observing and describing the relevant phenomena\nand establishing the general laws on the basis of induction. The\nparticularity of Brentano\u2019s method lies in the fact that\npsychology is based mainly on observation that is performed from a\nfirst person point of view. The psychologist draws on the intimate\nknowledge concerning her own current mental phenomena that she gains\nthrough inner perception (which, as we shall see below, is to be\ndistinguished from inner observation). Brentano does not suggest,\nhowever, that these descriptions are infallible: as it is impossible\nto live and describe a particular experience at the same time, all\ndescriptions of mental phenomena have to rely on memory and inner\nobservation.\n\n\u201cIf the attempt to observe the anger which stirs us becomes\nimpossible because the phenomenon disappears, it is clear that an\nearlier state of excitement can no longer be interfered in this way.\nAnd we really can focus our attention on a past mental phenomenon just\nas we can upon a present physical phenomenon, and in this way we can,\nso to speak, observe it.\u201d (PES, 26).\n\n[\u201cWenn der Versuch, den Zorn, der uns bewegt, beobachtend zu\nverfolgen, durch Aufhebung des Ph\u00e4nomens unm\u00f6glich wird, so\nkann dagegen ein Zustand fr\u00fcherer Aufregung offenbar keine\nSt\u00f6rung mehr erleiden. Auch gelingt es wirklich, dem vergangenen\npsychischen Ph\u00e4nomen so wie einem gegenw\u00e4rtigen physischen\nmit Aufmerksamkeit sich zuzuwenden, und es in dieser Weise sozusagen\nbeobachten.\u201d (PES, 49)]\n\n\nMoreover, as inner perception and memory as sources of experience are\nlimited to one\u2019s own mental life, they have to be complemented\nwith the \u201cindirect knowledge of the mental phenomena of\nothers\u201d [\u201cindirekte Erkenntnis fremder psychischer\nPh\u00e4nomene\u201d], which we can gain on the basis of the manifest\nbehavior we can observe in others, including their verbal behavior,\ni.e., when \u201ca person describes them directly in words.\u201d\n(PES 28) [\u201cjemand geradezu in Worten sie\nbeschreibt\u201d] (PES 53). \n\nBrentano\u2019s approach, like that of other introspectionist\npsychologists of the late nineteenth century, was harshly criticized\nwith the rise of scientific psychology in the tradition of logical\npositivism, especially by behaviorists, who argue that empirical\npsychology must not make use of introspection, but only of data that\ncan be obtained by the observation of the manifest behaviour of human\nbeings from a third-person point of view. This should not obscure the\nfact that Brentano did play a crucial role in the process of\npsychology becoming an independent science. He distinguished between\ngenetic and empirical or, as he called it,\ndescriptive psychology, a distinction that is most explicitly\ndrawn in lecture notes form the mid-1880s that have been published in\nDescriptive Psychology (DP). Genetic psychology\nstudies psychological phenomena from a third-person point of view. It\ninvolves the use of experiments and thus satisfies the scientific\nstandards we nowadays expect of an empirical science. Even though\nBrentano never conducted psychological experiments in laboratories, he\nvery actively supported the installation of the first laboratories for\nexperimental psychology in the Austro-Hungarian Empire \u2013 a goal\nthat was achieved by his student Alexius Meinong in Graz. Descriptive\npsychology (to which Brentano sometimes also referred\nas\u00a0\u201cphenomenology\u201d (cf. DP 137)) aims at\ndescribing consciousness from a first-person point of view. Its goal\nis to list \u201cfully the basic components out of which everything\ninternally perceived by humans is composed, and \u2026 [to\nenumerate] the ways in which these components can be connected\u201d\n(DP 4). Brentano\u2019s distinction between genetic and\ndescriptive psychology strongly influenced Husserl\u2019s development\nof the phenomenological method, especially in its early phases. But\nalready then Brentano could not approve of Husserl\u2019s development\nfor it involved the intuition of abstract essences, the existence of\nwhich Brentano denied. With his so-called \u201ctranscendental\nturn\u201d in the mid of the first decade of the twentieth century,\nHusserl alienated himself more and more from the Brentanian roots of\nthe phenomenological method.\n",
