    "main_text": "Causation and Entropy\n5. Causation and Entropy\n\nSeveral authors have argued that the causal asymmetry and the\ndirection of causation are closely related to the thermodynamic\nasymmetry that the entropy of a closed system does not decrease. An\nearly discussion of possible connection between the two\n\u201ctemporal arrows\u201d occurs in Reichenbach (1956). More\nrecent discussions of connections between the two arrows argue more\nperspicuously that the thermodynamic and the time-asymmetry of\ncausation have as their common origin the initial randomness\nassumption or the assumption of initial microscopic chaos. The\nassumption of initial microscopic chaos is a central assumption in\nneo-Boltzmannian accounts of the thermodynamic asymmetry. These\naccounts posit a cosmological hypothesis, according to which the\nuniverse began its life in an extremely low entropy state \\(M(0),\\)\nwhich Richard Feynman has dubbed the Past Hypothesis (1965),\ntogether with an equiprobability distribution over all microstates\ncompatible with \\(M(0).\\) David Albert and Barry Loewer argue that the\npackage consisting of past hypothesis, probability postulate, and the\ndynamical laws on the microlevel\u2014a package they call the\nMentaculus after the Coen Brother\u2019s movie A Serious\nMan\u2014not only can account for the thermodynamic asymmetry\nbut also provides the probabilities for every macroscopic\ngeneralization as well as the machinery to ground the causal asymmetry\nand epistemic asymmetries concerning our access to past and future\nevents (Albert 2000, 2015; Loewer 2007, 2012).\n\nWhile on Albert and Loewer\u2019s account the causal asymmetry is\nultimately grounded in the probability postulate, they attempt to\nderive this asymmetry via a somewhat circuitous route. The first step\nis to argue that the Mentaculus implies a branching tree structure\ntoward the future on the macrolevel, according to which the\nuniverse\u2019s macrostate at a time is compatible with many more\ndifferent macro-evolutions toward the future than macro-evolutions\ntoward the past. In a second step they argue that this branching tree\nstructure underwrites an asymmetry of counterfactual dependence on the\nmacro-level and thereby supports a broadly Lewisian counterfactual\nanalysis of the temporal arrow of causation. The claim that the\nMentaculus implies a temporally asymmetric branching tree structure of\nthe kind postulated by Loewer is criticized in Frisch (2010): since\nfuture higher entropy macro states occupy vastly larger regions of\nphase space than lower entropy past states, thermodynamically normal\nevolutions, if anything, suggest an upside-down tree\n structure.\n\nOther authors have proposed more direct arguments for deriving the\ncausal asymmetry from assumptions made in the foundations of\nthermodynamics, than the one developed by Albert and Loewer, arguing\nthat we can derive the common cause principle and thereby the\ndirection of causation directly from the assumption of initial\nprobabilistic independence. For a large class of microscopic\nconditions the probabilistic independence assumption follows from the\nassumption of initial microscopic chaos (Horwich 1987; Papineau\n1985). In particular, as Arntzenius argues, the probabilistic\nindependence assumption will be satisfied for spatially separated\nmicrostates if we assume initial microscopic chaos (Arntzenius 1999\n[2010]). There is also an active debate in the literature on how the\ncausal and thermodynamic asymmetries relate to various epistemic\nasymmetries, such as an asymmetry of records or an asymmetry\nconcerning our epistemic access to the past and to the future. For\ndifferent accounts of the knowledge asymmetry and an asymmetry of\nrecords see Horwich 1987; Albert 2000, 2015; Loewer 2007; Frisch 2007,\n2014; and Ismael 2016.\n\nMost authors exploring the connection between the thermodynamic and\ncausal asymmetries argue that the causal asymmetry is ultimately\ngrounded in some facts about the initial state of the universe. Some\nauthors, however, have argued that the explanatory direction is\nreversed and that the causal asymmetry accounts for the asymmetry\nbetween prevailing initial and final conditions. Maudlin has argued\nthat the difference between initial and final conditions is a\nreflection of causal laws that, he maintains, underwrite the passage\nof time (Maudlin 2007: 131). \n",
