    "main_text": "Action and Freedom\n4. Action and Freedom\n\nThe core of Austin\u2019s work on freedom and action is contained in\n\u201cA Plea for Excuses\u201d (1957) and developed in \u201cIfs\nand Cans\u201d (1956a), \u201cThree Ways of Spilling Ink\u201d\n(1966), and \u201cPretending\u201d (1958a). The three most\ndistinctive features of his views in this area are the following.\n\n(1)\nAustin\nproposes that philosophers should attend to the details of the ways in\nwhich we talk about particular actions of specific types rather than\nattempting a more direct assault on general questions about freedom\nand action (1957: 175\u2013181; 1966: 273).\n(2)\n\nAustin holds that in order for someone to count as responsible for an\naction, nothing more need be true than that the action is a normal or\nstandard instance of something they do. For example, it need not be\ntrue of the actor, in addition, that they did what they did\nvoluntarily or on purpose (1957: 189\u2013204;\n1966).\n(3)\n\nAustin is inclined to think that, insofar as he understands the thesis\nof determinism, it is incompatible with what we ordinarily\ntake to be true of human action (1956a: 218 fn.1, 231).\n\n",
