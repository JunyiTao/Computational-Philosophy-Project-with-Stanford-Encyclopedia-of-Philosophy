It is generally agreed that\npleasure is desired for its own sake, and it is plausible that many\npeople also desire the welfare of their children, the success of their\nfavorite sports teams, and the end of injustice, and desire them all\nintrinsically. To desire something intrinsically is not to desire it\nexclusively for its own sake, but to desire it at least partially for\nits own sake: my father desires my welfare in part for my own sake, but\nno doubt he also desires it in part because he would have trouble\nsleeping were I doing poorly, and he does not want to lose sleep.\n\n\nThat is to say, my father desires my welfare both intrinsically and\ninstrumentally: as a means to an end. Normally, however, one calls a\ndesire \u2018instrumental\u2019 when one means it is merely\ninstrumental: when one means that the end is desired merely as a means\nto some other end, and not at all for its own sake (instrumental\ndesires are also sometimes called \u2018extrinsic\u2019).\n\n\nAn interesting case of instrumental desires might be many of the\nso-called \u2018second-order desires\u2019 that have been discussed\nin the wake of Harry Frankfurt's work. According to Frankfurt, it\nis the power to form desires about their own desires, i.e.,\nsecond-order desires, that makes us persons, makes us beings capable of\nhaving cares, loves, and free will (e.g., Frankfurt 1971; 1999).\nSecond-order desires are desires regarding one's first-order\ndesires, and first-order desires are desires for ordinary\n(non-conative) things such as snacks or the trouncing of the New York\nYankees. Thus, a desire to yell at a drunken reveler who disturbs my\nsleep is a first-order desire, while a desire that I not act on my\ndesire to yell at the drunken reveler is a second-order desire. If one\nconsiders whether such a second-order desire is intrinsic or\ninstrumental, the most reasonable conclusion is typically that the\ndesire is instrumental: I desire not to act on my desire to yell\nbecause I desire to not have rocks thrown at my window, and I see not\nacting on my desire to yell as a means to not having rocks thrown at my\nwindow. (Note that David Lewis' discussion of the role of\nsecond-order desires in valuing requires that they be intrinsic\ndesires. This raises an interesting question: how often would a\nsecond-order desire be truly intrinsic? See Lewis 1989.)\n\n\nIn the above scenario, I might also intrinsically desire to be civil\nand tolerant, and see not acting on my desire to yell as a way to be\ncivil and tolerant. But in this case, the relation between my\nintrinsic desire and my desire not to act on my desire to yell is not\nquite an instrumental relation. Refraining from acting on my desire to\nyell is not a means for achieving the end of civil and tolerant\nbehavior.  Rather, it is an instance of civil and tolerant\nbehavior. In such situations, it is said that my desire not to act on\nmy desire to yell is a realizer desire: a desire for an end that would\ncount as one possible realization of an intrinsic desire. This sort of\ndesire gets some discussion in, e.g., Arpaly and Schroeder (2014) and\nSchmidtz (1994).\n",
