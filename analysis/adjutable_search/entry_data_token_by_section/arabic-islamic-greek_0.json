    "main_text": "The Syriac Background\n1. The Syriac Background\n\nBefore the rise of Islam, a multisecular tradition of learning (Brock\n1977, 1994; Bettiolo 2005; Watt 2010) had already achieved in Syria\nthe transition \u201cfrom antagonism to assimilation\u201d (Brock\n1982) of the Greek philosophical\n culture,[6]\n especially but not exclusively\n Aristotelian.[7]\n Within the theological schools of Edessa and Nisibi, during the 4th\nand 5th centuries, not only were the exegetical works translated from\nGreek into Syriac (e.g. those of Theodorus of Mopsuestia), but so were\nphilosophical works (in particular, Aristotle\u2019s logical writings\nand Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge). The continuity between the\nNeoplatonic schools of late Antiquity, with their typical approach to\nthe Aristotelian corpus (Hadot 1991), is best exemplified by Sergius\nof Resh\u02bfayna (d. 536), a physician who held a prominent position\nin the Syriac Church (Hugonnard-Roche 2001, 2004). A former student of\nAmmonius in the Neoplatonic school of Alexandria, Sergius translated\ninto Syriac some thirty treatises by Galen, the pseudo-Aristotelian\nDe\n Mundo,[8]\n a treatise by Alexander of Aphrodisias, On the Principles of the\nAll (lost in\n Greek),[9]\n the writings of Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite and Evagrius Ponticus\n(Watt 2011); he is also the author of a treatise on Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories and another one on the scope of Aristotle\u2019s\n writings.[10]\n After the Arab conquest of Damascus (635) and the whole of Syria\n(636), the Christian intellectual communities living under the Umayyad\nCaliphate (661\u2013750) continued to assimilate Greek philosophy and\nscience, focusing in particular on the Aristotelian logical corpus\ntogether with its Neoplatonic introduction, namely, Porphyry\u2019s\n Isagoge.[11]\n This tradition of learning (Gutas 1983; Brock 1993; Hugonnard-Roche\n2004; 2007; 2009; 2011) lay in the background of many of the\nChristians of Syria who took part in the translation movement fostered\nby the early \u02bfAbbasid Caliphate (Watt 2004, Janos 2015). Albeit\nsuperseded in number and importance by the translations into Arabic,\ntranslations into Syriac continued even amidts the growing\ntranslations into Arabic, in the \u02bfAbbasid capital of Baghdad.\n",
