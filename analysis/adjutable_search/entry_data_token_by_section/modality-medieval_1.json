    "main_text": "Early Medieval Developments\n2. Early Medieval Developments\n\nEarly medieval thinkers were well acquainted with ancient modal\nconceptions through Boethius\u2019s works. One of the Aristotelian\nmodal paradigms occurring in Boethius is that of possibility as\npotency (potestas, potentia). According to Boethius,\nwhen the term \u2018possibility\u2019 (possibilitas) is\nused in the sense of \u2018potency\u2019, it refers to real powers\nor tendencies, the ends of which are either actual or non-actual at\nthe moment of utterance. Some potencies are never unrealized. They are\nsaid to be necessarily actual. When potencies are not actualized,\ntheir ends are said to exist potentially (In Periherm. II,\n453\u2013455). Necessarily actual potencies leave no room for the\npotencies of their contraries, for they would remain unrealized\nforever and the constitution of nature does not include elements which\nwould be in vain (In Periherm. II, 236). The potencies of\nnon-necessary features of being do not exclude contrary potencies.\nThey are not always and universally actualized, but as potency-types\neven these potencies are taken to satisfy the actualization criterion\nof genuineness (In Periherm. I, 120\u2013121; II, 237).\n\nBoethius\u2019s view that the types of potencies and potency based\npossibilities are sometimes actualized is in agreement with the\nAristotelian frequency interpretation of modality. This is another\nBoethian conception of necessity and possibility. He thought that\nmodal notions can be regarded as tools for expressing temporal or\ngeneric frequencies. According to the temporal version, what always\nis, is by necessity, and what never is, is impossible. Possibility is\ninterpreted as expressing what is at least sometimes actual.\nCorrespondingly, a generic property of a species is possible only if\nit is exemplified at least in one member of that species (In\nPeriherm. I, 120\u2013121, 200\u2013201; II, 237).\n\nLike Aristotle, Boethius often treated statement-making utterances as\ntemporally indeterminate sentences. The same sentence can be uttered\nat different times, and many of these temporally indeterminate\nsentences may sometimes be true and sometimes false, depending on the\ncircumstances at the moment of utterance. If the state of affairs the\nactuality of which makes the sentence true is omnitemporally actual,\nthe sentence is true whenever it is uttered. In this case, it is\nnecessarily true. If the state of affairs associated with an\nassertoric sentence is always non-actual, the sentence is always false\nand therefore impossible. A sentence is possible only if what is\nasserted is not always non-actual (I, 124\u2013125). Quasi-statistical\nideas are also employed in Ammonius\u2019s Greek commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s De interpretatione which shares some\nsources with Boethius\u2019s work (88.12\u201328) and in Alexander\nof Aphrodisias\u2019s commentary on Aristotle\u2019s modal\nsyllogistic. (See Mueller 1999, 23\u201331.)\n\nIn dealing with Chapter 9 of Aristotle\u2019s De\ninterpretatione, Boethius argues (II, 241) that because\n\n(1)\nM(pt & \u00ac pt)\n(1\u2032)\nIt is possible that p obtains at t and\nnot-p obtains at t\n\n\nis not acceptable, one should also deny\n\n(2)\npt & Mt \u00acpt\n(2\u2032)\np obtains at t and it is possible at t that not-p obtains at t.\n\n\nThe denial of (2) is equivalent to\n\n(3)\npt\u00a0\u2192\u00a0 Lt pt\n(3\u2032)\nIf p obtains at t then it is necessary at t that p obtains at t.\n\n\n(2) was generally denied in ancient philosophy and its denial was\ntaken as an axiom by Boethius as well. Correspondingly, (3) shows how\nthe necessity of the present was understood in ancient thought.\nBoethius thought that the temporal necessity of p can be\nqualified by shifting attention from temporally definite cases or\nstatements to their temporally indeterminate counterparts (I,\n121\u2013122; II, 242\u2013243; cf. Ammonius 153.24\u201326). This\nwas one of Boethius\u2019s interpretations of the Aristotelian\ndistinction between necessity now and necessity without qualification.\nBut he also made use of the diachronic model according to which the\nnecessity of p at t does not imply that, before\nt, it was necessary that p obtains at\nt.\n\nBoethius developed the diachronic ideas as part of his criticism of\nStoic determinism. If it is not true that everything is causally\nnecessitated, there must be genuine alternatives in the course of\nevents. Free choice was the source of contingency in which Boethius\nwas mainly interested, but he thought in addition that according to\nthe Peripatetic doctrine there is a real factor of indeterminacy in\nthe causal nexus of nature. When Boethius refers to chance, free\nchoice, and possibility in this context, his examples include\ntemporalized modal notions which refer to diachronic prospective\npossibilities at a given moment of time. A temporally determinate\nprospective possibility may not be realized at the time to which it\nrefers, in which case it ceases to be a possibility. Boethius did not\ndevelop the idea of simultaneous alternatives which would remain\nintact even when diachronic possibilities had vanished, insisting that\nonly what is actual at a certain time is at that time possible at that\ntime (cf. (3) above). But he also thought that there are objective\nsingular contingencies, so that the result of some prospective\npossibilities is indefinite and uncertain \u2018not only to us who\nare ignorant, but to nature\u2019 (In Periherm. I, 106, 120;\nII, 190\u2013192, 197\u2013198, 203, 207). (For Boethius\u2019s\nmodal conceptions, see Kretzmann 1985; Knuuttila 1993,\n45\u201362.)\n\nAs for the discussion of future contingent statements in De\ninterpretatione 9, Boethius\u2019s view shows similarities to\nthat of Ammonius, both authors apparently having known some similar\nGreek discussions. (Ammonius\u2019s Greek commentary on De\ninterpretatione is translated by D. Blank and Boethius\u2019s\ntwo Latin commentaries by N. Kretzmann in the same volume, with essays\nby R. Sorabji, N. Kretzmann and M. Mignucci, in 1998.) According to\nthe majority interpretation, Ammonius and Boethius ascribe to\nAristotle the view that the predictions of future contingent events\nand their denials differ from other contradictory pairs of\npropositions because truth and falsity are not definitely distributed\nbetween them. The propositions are consequently neither true nor\nfalse, but their disjunctions are necessary. This was characterized as\nbroad bivalence by Kretzmann 1987, 1998. (See also Frede 1985; Craig\n1988; Gaskin 1995.) Another interpretation holds that future\ncontingents are not definitely true or false in Boethius\u2019s view\nbecause their truth-makers are not yet determined, but are true or\nfalse in an indeterminate way. No qualification of the principle of\nbivalence is involved (Mignucci 1989, 1998; for a related\ninterpretation of Ammonius, see Seel 2000.) While most medieval\nthinkers regarded the latter view as true in theology, many of them\nthought that Aristotle\u2019s opinion was similar to the Boethian\nbroad bivalence. Peter Abelard and John Buridan were among those who\nread Aristotle as holding that future contingent propositions are true\nor false. Peter Auriol argued that these propositions lack a\ntruth-value; even God is aware of the future in a way which does not\nimply bivalence. This was an exceptional view. (See Normore 1982,\n1993; Lewis 1987; Schabel 2000; Knuuttila 2010.) Boethius, Aquinas,\nand many others thought that God can know future contingents only\nbecause the flux of time is present to divine eternity. Some late\nmedieval thinkers, for example John Duns Scotus and William of Ockham,\nfound the idea of atemporal presence of history to God problematic and\ntried to find other models for foreknowledge. These discussions led to\nthe so-called middle knowledge theory of the counterfactuals of\nfreedom (Craig 1988; Freddoso 1988; Dekker 2000).\n\nFrom the point of view of the history of modal thought, interesting\nthings took place in theology in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.\nAugustine had already criticized the application of the frequency\nmodel of possibility to divine power; for him, God has freely chosen\nthe actual world and its providential plan from alternatives which he\ncould have realized but did not will to do (potuit sed\nnoluit). This way of thinking differs from ancient philosophical\nmodal paradigms because the metaphysical basis is now the eternal\ndomain of simultaneous alternatives instead of the idea of one\nnecessary world order. In Augustine, God\u2019s eternal ideas of\nfinite beings represent the possibilities of how the highest being can\nbe imitated, the possibilities thus having an ontological foundation\nin God\u2019s essence. This was the dominating conception of\ntheological modal metaphysics until Duns Scotus departed from it. (See\nKnuuttila 2014, 86\u201389). The discrepancy between the Catholic doctrine\nof God\u2019s freedom and power and the philosophical modal\nconceptions was brought into the scope of discussion in the eleventh\ncentury. Peter Damian argued for the sovereignty of divine omnipotence\nin a way that is sometimes mistakenly taken to include the power to\nchange the past (Holopainen 1996). Anselm of Canterbury tried to\ndevelop a general modal semantics based on the notions of power and\npotentiality, with various conceptual distinctions (Knuuttila 2004).\nModal questions in philosophy and theology were developed in a more\nsophisticated way in twelfth-century considerations of God\u2019s\npower and providence and historical contingencies with the idea of\nsimultaneous alternatives. The idea of divine choice between\nalternatives was absent in Avicenna and Averroes, but it was defended\nby al-Ghazali, who criticized Avicenna\u2019s necessitarian metaphysics.\n(See Kukkonen 2000; for metaphysical necessitarianism in Arabic\nphilosophy, see Belo 2007; De Haan 2020.) \n\nEven though Abelard (1079\u20131142) sometimes made use of the\nBoethian modal concepts (as Anselm also did), he was interested in the\nphilosophical significance of the idea of modality as alternativeness.\nAssuming that what is actual is temporally necessary at a certain\npoint of time as no longer avoidable, he adds that unrealized\ncounterfactual alternatives are possible at the same time in the sense\nthat they could have happened at that time. There are also merely\nimaginable alternatives, such as Socrates\u2019s being a bishop,\nwhich never had a real basis in things. (See Martin 2001, 2003;\nMarenbon 2007, 156\u2013158, is sceptical about this interpretation;\nsee also Binini 2019.) Gilbert of Poitiers (d. 1154) stressed the idea\nthat natural regularities which are called natural necessities are not\nabsolute, since they are freely chosen by God and can be overridden by\ndivine power. This basically Augustinian conception was a widespread\ntheological view in the twelfth century. In explaining Plato\u2019s\n\u2018Platonitas\u2019 Gilbert innovatively argues that this\nincludes all that Plato was, is and will be as well as what he could\nbe but never is (The Commentaries on Boethius\n144.77\u201378, 274.75\u201376; Knuuttila 1993, 75\u201382).\n\nAn interesting early thirteenth-century philosophical analysis of\nAugustinian modalities was put forward by Robert Grosseteste (d. 1253;\nLewis 1996). Grosseteste taught that while things are primarily called\nnecessary or possible \u2018from eternity and without\nbeginning\u2019 with respect to God\u2019s eternal knowledge, there\nare necessities and impossibilities with a beginning in God\u2019s\nprovidence which are eternal contingencies in the sense that God could\nhave chosen their opposites (De libero arbitrio\n168.26\u2013170.33, 178.24\u201329). One of the theses of\ntwelfth-century authors, later called nominales, was that\n\u2018What is once true is always true\u2019. It was argued that\nwhile tensed statements about temporally definite singular events have\na changing truth-value, the corresponding non-tensed propositions are\nunchangingly true or false, without being necessarily true or false\nfor this reason (Nuchelmans 1973, 177\u2013189; Iwakuma and Ebbesen\n1992). This was in agreement with Abelard\u2019s view that future\ncontingent propositions are true or false. The actuality of a\ncontingent state of affairs at a specified future time does not\nexclude the non-temporalized possibility of simultaneous alternatives,\nnor does the truth of a proposition about this state of affairs make\nit necessary (Abelard, Glossae super Peri hermeneias IX,\n520\u2013577; see also Peter of Poitiers (d. 1205),\nSententiae I.7.133\u201343, I.12.164\u2013223, I.14,\n328\u2013353).\n",
