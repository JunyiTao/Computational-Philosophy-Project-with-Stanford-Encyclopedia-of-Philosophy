    "main_text": "The Problem of God || From Images and Symbols to Concepts and Ontology\n3.2 From Images and Symbols to Concepts and Ontology\n\nMainstream philosophers of religion have so far failed to take\nexplicit account of the gendered dynamics of religious thought, but\nfor forty years a variety of other scholars, including biblical\nexegetes, theologians, ethicists, and feminist philosophers of\nreligion, have produced an extraordinary explosion of research\nresulting in feminist thealogies, critical hermeneutics of suspicion,\nand woman-affirming writings on spirituality. In these, the problem of\nGod appears as a crucial site of reconstruction.\n\nThe medieval theologian Hildegard of Bingen struggled to capture her\nvision of the Spirit of God with a cascade of vivid images and a\nm\u00e9lange of metaphors. As rendered by Elizabeth Johnson in the\nfollowing passage, Hildegard\u2019s vision encompassed many of the themes\nthat appear in the writing of twentieth century feminist writers. The\ndivine spirit, Hildegard wrote, is the very life of the life of all\ncreatures; the way in which everything is penetrated with\nconnectedness and relatedness; a burning fire who sparks, ignites,\ninflames, kindles hearts; a guide in the fog; a balm for wounds; a\nshining serenity; an overflowing fountain that spreads to all sides.\n\n\n\nShe is life, movement, color, radiance, restorative stillness in the\ndin. Her power makes all withered sticks and souls green again with\nthe juice of life. She purifies, absolves, strengthens, heals, gathers\nthe perplexed, seeks the lost. She pours the juice of contrition into\nhardened hearts. She plays music in the soul, being herself the melody\nof praise and joy. She awakens mighty hope, blowing everywhere the\nwinds of renewal in creation.  (paraphrase in Johnson 1992: 127\u2013128) \n\n\nThis, for Hildegard in the 12th century, is the mystery of the God in\nwhom humans live and move and have their being.\n\nEight centuries later, Paula Gunn Allen wrote in similarly provocative\nlanguage of the spirit that pervades her Laguna Pueblo/Sioux peoples:\n\n\n\nThere is a spirit that pervades everything, that is capable of\npowerful song and radiant movement, and that moves in and out of the\nmind. The colors of this spirit are multitudinous, a glowing, pulsing\nrainbow. Old Spider Woman is one name for this quintessential spirit,\nand Serpent Woman is another\u2026and what they together have made\nis called Creation, Earth, creatures, plants and light. (1986: 22)\n\n\nIn Ntozake Shange\u2019s well-known play, a tall black woman rose from\ndespair and cried out, \u201ci found god in myself and i loved her, i\nloved her fiercely\u201d (1976: 63).\n\nIn a frequently cited passage in The Color Purple, Alice\nWalker voiced a similar note as Shug recounted to Celie the epiphany\nthat came over her when she learned to get the old white man off her\neyeball:\n\nIt? I ast.\n\nYeah, It. God ain\u2019t a he or a she, but a It.\n\nBut what do it look like? I ast.\n\nDon\u2019t look like nothing, she say. It ain\u2019t a picture show. It ain\u2019t\nsomething you can look at apart from anything else, including\nyourself. I believe God is everything, say Shug. Everything that is or\never will be. And when you can feel that, and be happy to feel that,\nyou\u2019ve found It (1982: 177\u201378).\n\n\nIn theological constructions, Rosemary Ruether (1983 [1993]) has\nworked with the unpronounceable written symbol \u201cGod/ess\u201d\nto connote the \u201cencompassing matrix of our being\u201d that\ntranscends patriarchal limitations and signals redemptive experience\nfor women as well as for men. Modelling God for a nuclear age, Sallie\nMcFague (1987) has experimented with metaphors of God as Mother,\nLover, and Friend of the world, with the world conceived of as God\u2019s\nown body. Correlating Paul Tillich\u2019s notion of the power of being with\nthe empowerment women know in freeing themselves from patriarchy, the\nearly Mary Daly (1973 [1985]) posited God as \u201cVerb\u201d, a dynamic\nbecoming process that energizes all things. Using process philosophy\u2019s\ncategories, Marjorie Suchocki (1982, 1988) has given new resonance to\nthe meaning of Whitehead\u2019s metaphors of God as \u201cthe lure for\nfeeling\u201d whose \u201cpower of persuasion\u201d aims to effect\njustice and peace. Blurring the lines between psychological, somatic,\nand religious experiences, Ruether (1983 [1993]) has projected an image of\n\u201cthe feminine divine\u201d grounded in the morphology of\nwomen\u2019s bodies in all their multiplicity and fluidity.\n\nIn all these cases, contemporary feminist articulations of a relation\nbetween God and the world, or God and female subjectivity, depicts the\ndivine as continuous with the world rather than radically transcendent\nontologically or metaphysically. Divine transcendence is seen to\nconsist either in total immanence or else in some dialectic between\nhorizontal transcendence and immanence.\n\nBut images and metaphors are not philosophical concepts, and the\nreference range of \u201cthe divine\u201d as it appears in these and\nother feminist writings is not always clear. While theologians are\nfrequently satisfied to work imaginatively with symbols, images, and\nmetaphors, without regard to the question what the symbols are\nsymbolic of, philosophers of religion normally seek more\nprecision and conceptual clarification.\n",
