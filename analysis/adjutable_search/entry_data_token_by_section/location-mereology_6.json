Perhaps there are no\nactual cases of the relevant sort. Such cases may even be physically\nimpossible\u2014ruled out by the laws of nature (though see the next\nsection). But one might still think that these cases are\nmetaphysically possible.\n\nAfter all, what is it that keeps material objects from\ninterpenetrating in the actual world? Repulsive forces, presumably.\nBut a standard view is that the laws governing such forces are not\nmetaphysically\n necessary.[6]\n And on that assumption it is natural to conclude that there are\nmetaphysically possible worlds in which any repulsive forces that\nexist can be overridden in such a way as to allow material objects to\ninterpenetrate. (For more on this, see Zimmerman 1996a and Sider\n2000.)\n\nA similar line of thought is sometimes framed as a conceivability\nargument. One might take cases of interpenetration to be conceivable\nor intuitively possible, and one might take this to be some evidence\nfor their possibility. In New Essays the Human Understanding\n(II.xxvii.1), Leibniz writes that\n\n\nwe find that two shadows or two rays of light interpenetrate, and we\ncould devise an imaginary world where bodies did the same. (1704\n[1996])\n\n\nSanford describes such a scenario in more detail:\n\n\nWhat imaginable circumstances would tempt us to say that two\n[disjoint] things were in the same place at the same time? Imagine two\nrectangular blocks of the same size and shape each moving along a\nstraight path perpendicular to the other. The blocks approach the\nintersection of the paths at the same time, and apparently neither\nslows down nor changes its direction. They seem to pass right through\none another, and they do this without changing with respect to colour,\ntexture, density, etc. We want to say that we have the same two blocks\nwith which we started. And we do not want to say that either block\npassed out of existence and was shortly thereafter re-created. Thus we\nwant to say that each block moved along its path without any\nspatio-temporal discontinuity. And we can say this only if we admit\nthat parts of one block simultaneously occupied the same space as\nparts of the other block. (1967: 37)\n\n\nAn objection suggests itself. Why think that, in this scenario, the\nblocks really are disjoint while they are passing through one\nanother?\n\nIn response, one might just stipulate that what is under\nconsideration are two always-disjoint blocks, and then insist that the\ncase remains conceivable, so described.\n\nAlternatively, one might further specify the case in such a way as to\nbe able to argue for the blocks' disjointness. Consider a certain\nregion, r, that is said by Sanford to the exact location of two\ndisjoint material objects: p1 (a part of Block 1)\nand p2 (a part of Block 2). One might add that two\nincompatible properties are instantiated at r\u2014say, having\nmass of 2 kg, and having mass of\n3 kg\u2014where each of these properties is such that if it is\ninstantiated by an entity x, then it is instantiated by\nanything that mereologically coincides with x. Presumably this\nis no less conceivable (or \u2018intuitively possible\u2019) than\nSanford's original case. But in this new version of the case, it is\nnot open to Sanford's opponent to claim that the co-located objects\nare identical or mereologically coincident with each other. For the\nregion contains a 2 kg object and a 3 kg object, and no one object is\nidentical to (or mereologically coincident with) both a 2 kg object\nand a 3 kg object.\n",
