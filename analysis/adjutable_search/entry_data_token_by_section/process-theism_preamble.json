    "main_text": "\n\nProcess theism typically refers to a family of theological ideas\noriginating in, inspired by, or in agreement with the metaphysical\norientation of the English philosopher-mathematician Alfred North\nWhitehead (1861\u20131947) and the American philosopher-ornithologist\nCharles Hartshorne (1897\u20132000). For both Whitehead and\nHartshorne, it is an essential attribute of God to be fully involved\nin and affected by temporal processes. This idea contrasts neatly with\ntraditional forms of theism that hold God to be or at least conceived\nas being, in all respects non-temporal (eternal), unchanging\n(immutable,) and unaffected by the world (impassible). Process theism\ndoes not deny that God is in some respects eternal,\nimmutable, and impassible, but it contradicts the classical view by\ninsisting that God is in some respects temporal, mutable, and\npassible. The views of Whitehead and Hartshorne should also be\ndistinguished from those that affirm that the divine being, by an act\nof self-limitation, opens itself to influence from the world. Some\nneo-Thomists hold this view and a group of Evangelical Christian\nphilosophers, calling themselves \u201copen theists,\u201d promote\nsimilar ideas. These forms of theism were influenced by process\ntheism, but they deny its claim that God is essentially in a\ngive-and-take relationship with the world. Moreover, process theism is\na genuinely philosophical theology in the sense that it is\nnot grounded in claims of special insight or revealed truth but in\nphilosophical reflection. Specifically, process theism is a product of\ntheorizing that takes the categories of becoming, change, and time as\nfoundational for metaphysics. The metaphysical underpinning of process\ntheism is often called process philosophy, a label suggested by the\ntitle of Whitehead\u2019s magnum opus, Process and Reality.\nIn order to bring out this philosophy\u2019s emphasis on relatedness,\nmany scholars follow Bernard Loomer in calling it process-relational\nphilosophy. Whitehead\u2019s preferred expression for his\nmetaphysical viewpoint is \u201cthe philosophy of organism.\u201d\nThis article concerns primarily the concept of God in process theism,\nalthough we shall conclude with a brief discussion of arguments for\nthe existence of God in process thought.\n",
