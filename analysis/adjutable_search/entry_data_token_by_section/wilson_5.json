    "main_text": "Perception\n6. Perception\n\nCook Wilson also argued against idealism that in apprehension it is\nneither the case that the object exists only within the apprehending\nconsciousness, nor that it is constituted by it: the object is\nindependent of the apprehending consciousness. As he wrote: \u201cthe\napprehension of an object is only possible through a being of the\nobject other than its being apprehended, and it is this being, no part\nitself of the apprehending thought, which is what is\napprehended\u201d (SI, 74). This independence, he considered to be\npresupposed by the very idea of knowledge expounded above. But he\nfurther rejected the distinction between act, content and object of\nperception, first by negating the act-object distinction:\n\n\nIn our ordinary experience and in the sciences, the thinker or\nobserver loses himself in a manner in the particular object he is\nperceiving or the truth he is proving. That is what he is thinking\nabout, and not about himself; and, though knowledge and perception\nimply both the distinction of the thinker from the object and the\nactive working of that distinction, we must not confuse this with the\nstatement that the thinking subject, in actualizing this distinction,\nthinks explicitly about himself, and his own activity, as distinct\nfrom the object. (SI, 79)\n\n\nAnd, secondly, by rejecting the notion of \u2018content\u2019:\n\u201cFor the only thing that can be found as \u2018content\u2019\nof the apprehending thought is the nature of the object\napprehended\u201d (SI, 75). Austin echoed this last point saying that\n\u201cour senses are dumb\u201d (Austin 1962, 11). (There is an\nextensive literature on this claim, see, e.g., (Travis 2004) or\n(Massin 2011).) The point is not that perception does not aim at an\nobject, but merely to deny that it does so through a\n\u2018content\u2019 acting as intermediary:\n\nwhat I think of the red object is its own redness, not some mental\ncopy of redness in my mind. I regard it as having real redness and not\nas having my copy of redness. [\u2026] If we ask in any instance\nwhat it is we think of a given object of knowledge, we find it always\nconceived as the nature or part of the nature of the thing known. (SI,\n64)\n\n\nWhat one apprehends must be the real object itself, not \u201csome\nmental copy\u201d of it, so Cook Wilson is claiming here that, as a\nstate of mind, knowledge contains its object: \u201cwhat we apprehend\n[\u2026] is included in the apprehension as a part of the activity\nor reality of apprehending\u201d (SI, 70). A long letter to G. F.\nStout (SI, 764\u2013800) is of particular importance here, where Cook\nWilson criticized Stout on \u2018Primary and Secondary\nQualities\u2019 (Stout 1904), with this key diagnosis, of the\n\u2018objectification of the appearing as appearance\u2019:\n\n\nThis is sometimes spoken from the side of the object as the\nappearance of the object to us. This \u2018appearance\u2019\nthen gets distinguished from the object [\u2026] But next the\nappearance, though properly the appearing of the\nobject, gets itself to be looked on as itself an object and the\nimmediate object of our consciousness, and being already, as we have\nseen, distinguished from the object and related to our subjectivity,\nbecomes, so to say, a merely subjective\n\u2018object\u2019\u2014\u2018appearance\u2019 in that sense. and\nso, as appearance of the object, it has now to be represented\nnot as the object but as some phenomenon caused in our consciousness\nby the object. Thus for the true appearance (= appearing) to us of the\nobject is substituted, through the\n\u2018objectification\u2019 of the appearing as appearance, the\nappearing to us of an appearance, the appearing of a\nphenomenon caused in us by the object. (SI, 796)\n\n\nCook Wilson\u2019s rejection of \u2018hybrid\u2019 accounts of\nknowledge (see the previous section) is linked to his rejection of\nepistemological \u2018intermediaries\u2019, so that knowledge could\nnot be of some such \u2018objectified\u2019 appearance. He\nconsidered all such intermediaries (\u2018images\u2019,\n\u2018copies\u2019, \u2018representative\u2019, tertium\nquid, etc.) as \u201cnot only useless in philosophy but\nmisleading as tending to obscure the solution of a difficult\nproblem\u201d (SI, 772). In this he stood in the tradition of Thomas\nReid, his arguments were as a matter of fact first developed against\nthe empiricism of Locke, Berkeley and Hume (for example in UL (\u00a7\n10)). In his letter to Stout, Cook Wilson put it thus:\n\n\nYou begin an important section of your argument by assuming the idea\nof sensations being representative.\n\nThey {represent\u2014express\u2014stand for} something other than\nthemselves.\n\nNow, I venture to think that the idea of such representation\nin philosophy, or psychology rather, is very loose and treacherous\nand, if used at all, should be preceded by a \u2018critique\u2019 of\nsuch representative character, and an explanation of the\nexact sense in which the word representative is used. (SI, 769)\n\n\nAgainst views of this kind, Cook Wilson developed three arguments in\nhis letter. First, he pointed out that it is impossible to know\nanything about the relation between the representative and the object,\nsince one can never truly compare the former to the latter. Secondly,\nhe claimed that representationalist theories are always in danger of\nleading towards idealism, since one must then somehow\n\u2018prove\u2019 the existence of the object which is, so to speak,\n\u2018behind\u2019 its representatives\u2014there might be none.\nThirdly, he claimed that all such theories beg the question, since the\nrepresentative has to be apprehended in turn by the mind, and not only\nthis further \u2018apprehension\u2019 remains unexplained, it would\nrequire that the mind be equipped with the very apparatus that the\nrepresentationalist theories were, to begin with, devised to\nexplain:\n\nWe want to explain knowing an object and we explain it solely in terms\nof the object known, and that by giving the mind not the object but\nsome idea of it which is said to be like it\u2014an image (however\nthe fact may be disguised). The chief fallacy of this is not so much\nthe impossibility of knowing such image is like the object, or that\nthere is any object at all, but that it assumes the very thing it is\nintended to explain. The image itself has to be apprehended and the\ndifficulty is only repeated. (SI, 803)\n\n\nCook Wilson also inveighed against Stout\u2019s notion of\n\u2018sensible extension\u2019 pointing out inter alia that\nit makes no sense to claim that these are extended without being in\nspace (SI, 783) and he tried to explain how a given object may appear\nto have different shapes from different perspectives, without making\nan appeal to any representative (SI, 790f.).\n\nStout answered these criticisms in print (for a discussion see Nasim\n2008, 30\u201340 & 94\u201398). He argued that he had not been\nholding a view akin to Locke\u2019s representationalism, claiming\nthat the \u2018representative function\u2019 of his\n\u2018presentations\u2019 is of a different nature, more like a\nmemory-image would represent what is remembered (Stout 1911, 14f.),\nbut it is at first blush unclear what he meant by this. Against Cook\nWilson\u2019s first argument, he claimed that in his conception\npresentations and presented objects form an \u201cinseparable\nunity\u201d (Stout 1911, 22), this being, once more, unclear. At all\nevents, both Stout and Russell, in his theory of\n\u2018sense-data\u2019 as \u2018objects of perception\u2019\n(Russell 1912), insisted that the physical object and the\nrepresentative are \u2018real\u2019. But one might say that this\n\u2018objectification of the appearing as appearance\u2019, does not\nannul Cook Wilson\u2019s diagnosis of the difficulties inherent in\nthat position. At least Russell was clearer about its implications,\nrequiring a \u2018logical construction\u2019 of physical objects as\nfunctions of \u2018sense-data\u2019. One way to counter Cook Wilson\non the absurdity of the locution \u2018sensible extensions\u2019 is\nto distinguish between \u2018private\u2019 and \u2018public\u2019\nspace, as Russell was to do in \u2018The Relation of Sense-Data to\nPhysics\u2019 (Russell 1917, 139\u2013171); as it is well-known,\nthis postulation generates its own set of difficulties, e.g., the\nclaim that space must have 6 dimensions (Russell 1917, 154). Russell\non \u2018sense-data\u2019 was to become a favourite target for\nPrichard\u2019s acerbic wit (Prichard 1915 & 1928).\n\nCook Wilson also wove his joint critique of the \u2018objectification\nof the appearing as appearance\u2019 and of representationalism into\na broad historical narrative according to which \u201cempiricism ends\nin the Subjective Idealism it was intended to avoid\u201d (UL, \u00a7\n10, see also SI, 60\u201363); he spoke of an \u201cinsidious and\nscarcely \u2018conscious\u2019 dialectic\u201d that \u201chas done\nmuch mischief in modern metaphysics and theories of perception\u201d\n(SI, 797). Wilfrid Sellars, who attended Prichard\u2019s classes as a\nRhodes Scholar at Oxford in the mid-1930s, found the idea of such a\n\u2018dialectic\u2019 appealing:\n\nI soon came under the influence of H. A. Prichard and, through him, of\nCook Wilson. I found here, or at least seemed to find, a clearly\narticulated approach to philosophical issues which undercut the\ndialectic, rooted in Descartes, which led to both Hume and 19th\nCentury Idealism. At the same time, I discovered Thomas Reid and found\nhim appealing for much the same reasons. (Sellars 1975, 284)\n\n\nAlthough Cook Wilson\u2019s philosophy may be construed as a\ncontinuation of sorts of the Scottish School of Hutcheson and Reid\n(see also section 10), it is striking that there are hardly any\nreferences to these authors in his writings, even more so given that\nthey contain critiques of Locke, Berkeley and Hume from a similar\nstandpoint. (See Alsaleh (2003), focussing on attacks on Hume and\ntheir impact on Price (1932) and Austin (1962), and Marion (2009) for\nan overview of the 19th-century stages of this\n\u2018dialectic\u2019).\n\nThere was, however, no doctrinal unity on perception among Cook\nWilson\u2019s epigones. Prichard was probably the first to put Cook\nWilson\u2019s views into print in \u2018Appearances and\nReality\u2019 (Prichard 1906) but, as already pointed out, he ended\nup arguing that in perception we systematically mistake colour\nexpanses for objects. H. H. Price, who was at first close to Cook\nWilson (Price 1924), incorporated a sense-data theory while rejecting\nphenomenalism in Perception (Price 1932). He became for that\nreason one of Austin\u2019s targets in Sense and Sensibilia\n(Austin 1962), which remains, for all its novelty, faithful to Cook\nWilson\u2019s orthodoxy on knowledge. At all events, a form of direct\nrealism in the theory of perception is one of the characteristic\nfeatures of Oxford Realism. It is an ancestor to contemporary variants\nsuch as the position argued for by John McDowell in Mind and\nWorld (McDowell 1994) and, after a long eclipse, Cook\nWilson\u2019s views are once more playing a role in current debates\nabout perception. (See for example references to them in Kalderon\n(2011, 241; 2018, xv, 49, 88 & 184), Siegel (2018, 2), Stoneham\n(2008, 319\u2013320).)\n\nOne topic of particular interest in this respect is\n\u2018disjunctivism\u2019 (see Soteriou (2016) for an overview).\nThis is the view that in perception one is faced either with\ncases of genuine perception or with cases of illusion or\nhallucination, as in \u2018I see a flash of light or I am\nhaving the perfect illusion of doing so\u2019 (Hinton 1973, 39). Such\ndisjunctions were first analysed in detail by Michael Hinton (see\nHinton (1973) and Snowdon (2008)), but there have been suggestions\nthat disjunctivism harks back to Austin or even Cook Wilson and\nPrichard (Kalderon & Travis (213, 498\u2013499), for\nAustin\u2019s case, see also Longworth (2019)). Adjudicating such\nclaims depends on one\u2019s understanding of disjunctivism itself,\nbut a few points can be adduced. Disjunctivism should not be confused\nwith any \u2018na\u00efve\u2019 or \u2018direct realism\u2019, but\none may appeal to it to defend such views, therefore one should expect\nCook Wilson and Oxford Realists to have taken some steps towards it.\nThe sharp distinction between knowledge and belief (section 5), with\nthe rejection of any \u2018highest common factor\u2019 between the\ntwo, should count as a first step. (The above-mentioned critiques of\nthe argument from illusion reinforce this point.) A further step\ntowards a form of disjunctivism is also taken when, having\ndistinguished knowledge from belief, Cook Wilson also claimed that\nbelief presupposes knowledge: it is only when assessing what I may\nknow about some thing that I might realize that it is not sufficient\nto claim that \u2018I know that p\u2019, so that I remain\ncircumspect and merely claim that \u2018I believe that\np\u2019 (see sections 4 & 5).\n",
