    "main_text": "What is Harm? || Other-Regarding Conduct\n5.1 Other-Regarding Conduct\n\nVarious definitions and understandings of \u201charm\u201d have been\noffered. One derived from Mill takes harmful conduct to be\n\u201cother-concerning\u201d or \u201cother-regarding\nconduct\u201d and, conversely, harmless conduct is\n\u201cself-regarding\u201d (Mill On Liberty, ch. 1, para\n9). Accordingly, if some actions have no social consequences, they\naffect only the actor and are therefore harmless. Hart seems\ndiscomforted enough by \u201ccritics\u201d of this Millian\nsuggestion to have been unwilling to adopt it himself across the\nboard. He surely had James Fitzjames Stephen\u2019s critique of Mill\nin mind among others (Stephen 1873 [1993]). These critics, he\nsays,\n\n\nhave urged that the line which Mill attempts to draw between actions\nwith which the law may interfere and those with which it may not is\nillusory. \u201cNo man is an island\u201d; and in an organised\nsociety it is impossible to identify classes of actions which harm no\none or no one but the individual who does them. (Hart 1963 [1982:\n5])\n\n\nDespite seeming to take Stephen\u2019s point against Mill, however,\nHart goes on to adopt the other-regarding/self-regarding understanding\nin a limited context: so far, he says, as the \u201cspecial topic of\nsexual morality\u201d is concerned there may exist a realm or area of\nconduct that is harmless; here it does seem, \u201cprima facie\nplausible that there are actions immoral by accepted standards and yet\nnot harmful to others\u201d (Hart 1963 [1982: 5]). It is not,\nhowever, clear how this understanding of harm is to be reconciled with\nHart\u2019s other uses of the term. For example, he discusses\n(sceptically) whether the \u201cmoral distress\u201d of persons\noccasioned by the moral wrongdoing of others should count as harm to\nthem (Hart 1963 [1982: 46]); cf. Waldron 1987 [1993]); and he asserts\nthat animal cruelty should be criminal, not pace Devlin to\n\u201cenforce a moral principle\u201d, but on account of animal\nsuffering. If there is a coherent way of bringing these various\nunderstandings of harm together, Hart does not himself supply it.\n",
