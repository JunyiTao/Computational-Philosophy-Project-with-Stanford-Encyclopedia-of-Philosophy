    "main_text": "Objections to Ontological Arguments\n5. Objections to Ontological Arguments\n\nObjections to ontological arguments take many forms. Some objections\nare intended to apply only to particular ontological arguments, or\nparticular forms of ontological arguments; other objections are\nintended to apply to all ontological arguments. It is a controversial\nquestion whether there are any successful general objections to\nontological arguments. \n\nOne general criticism of ontological arguments which have appeared\nhitherto is this: none of them is persuasive, i.e., none of\nthem provides those who do not already accept the conclusion that God\nexists\u2014and who are reasonable, reflective, well-informed,\netc.\u2014with either a pro tanto reason or an\nall-things-considered reason to accept that conclusion. Any reading of\nany ontological argument which has been produced so far which is\nsufficiently clearly stated to admit of evaluation yields a result\nwhich is invalid, or possesses a set of premises which it is clear in\nadvance that no reasonable, reflective, well-informed, etc.\nnon-theists will accept, or has a benign conclusion which has no\nreligious significance, or else falls prey to more than one of the\nabove failings.\n\nFor each of the families of arguments introduced in the earlier\ntaxonomy, we can give general reasons why arguments of that family\nfall under the general criticism. In what follows, we shall apply\nthese general considerations to the exemplar arguments introduced in\nsection 2.\n\n(1) Definitional arguments: These are arguments in which ontologically\ncommitting vocabulary is introduced solely via a definition. An\nobvious problem is that claims involving that vocabulary cannot then\nbe non-question-beggingly detached from the scope of that definition.\n(The inference from \u2018By definition, God is an existent\nbeing\u2019 to \u2018God exists\u2019 is patently invalid; while\nthe inference to \u2018By definition, God exists\u2019 is valid, but\nuninteresting. In the example given earlier, the premises license the\nclaim that, as a matter of definition, God possesses the perfection of\nexistence. But, as just noted, there is no valid inference from this\nclaim to the further claim that God exists.)\n\n(2) Conceptual arguments: These are arguments in which ontologically\ncommitting vocabulary is introduced solely within the scope of\nhyperintensional operators (e.g. \u2018believes that\u2019,\n\u2018conceives of\u2019, etc.). Often, these operators have two\nreadings, one of which can cancel ontological commitment, and the\nother of which cannot. On the reading which can give cancellation (as\nin the most likely reading of \u2018John believes in Santa\nClaus\u2019), the inference to a conclusion in which the ontological\ncommitment is not cancelled will be invalid. On the reading which\ncannot cancel ontological commitment (as in that reading of\n\u2018John thinks about God\u2019 which can only be true if there is\na God to think about), the premises are question-begging: they incur\nontological commitments which non-theists reject. In our sample\nargument, the claim, that I conceive of an existent being than which\nno greater being can be conceived, admits of the two kinds of readings\njust distinguished. On the one hand, on the reading which gives\ncancellation, the inference to the conclusion that there is a being\nthan which no greater can be conceived is plainly invalid. On the\nother hand, on the reading in which there is no cancellation, it is\nclear that this claim is one which no reasonable, etc. non-theist will\naccept: if you doubt that there is a being than which no greater can\nbe conceived, then, of course, you doubt whether you can have thoughts\nabout such a being.\n\n(3) Modal arguments: These are arguments with premises which concern\nmodal claims about God, i.e., claims about the possibility or\nnecessity of God\u2019s attributes and existence. Suppose that we\nagree to think about possibility and necessity in terms of possible\nworlds: a claim is possibly true just in case it is true in at least\none possible world; a claim is necessarily true just in case it is\ntrue in every possible world; and a claim is contingent just in case\nit is true in some possible worlds and false in others. Some theists\nhold that God is a necessarily existent being, i.e., that God exists\nin every possible world; all non-theists reject the claim that God\nexists in the actual world. The sample argument consists, in effect,\nof two premises:\n\nGod exists in at least one possible world.\nGod exists in all possible worlds if God exists in any.\n\n\nA minimally rational non-theist cannot accept both of these premises\n\u2013 they entail that God exists in every possible world whereas a\nminimally rational non-theist maintains that there is at least one\npossible world in which God does not exist. Given that a minimally\nrational non-theist says that there is at least one possible world in\nwhich God does not exist, such a non-theist can offer a parallel\ncounterargument with the following two premises:\n\nGod fails to exist in at least one possible world.\nGod exists in all possible worlds if God exists in any.\n\n\nThese premises entail that God exists in no possible world, and hence\nthat God does not exist in the actual world. Considered together, the\nargument and the counterargument just mentioned plainly do not give\nanyone a reason to prefer theism to non-theism, and nor do they give\nanyone a reason to prefer non-theism to theism. So the sample argument\nis unsuccessful: it doesn\u2019t supply an all-things-considered\nreason to prefer theism to non-theism (just as the counterargument\ndoesn\u2019t supply an all-things-considered reason to prefer\nnon-theism to theism).\n\n(4) Meinongian arguments: These are arguments which depend somehow or\nother on Meinongian theories of objects. Consider the schema\n\u2018The F G is F\u2019. Naive Meinongians will\nsuppose that if F is instantiated with any property, then the\nresult is true (and, quite likely, necessary, analytic and a priori).\nSo, for example, the round square is round; the bald current King of\nFrance is bald; and so on. However, more sophisticated Meinongians\nwill insist that there must be some restriction on the substitution\ninstances for F, in order to allow one to draw the obvious and\nimportant ontological distinction between the following two groups:\n{Bill Clinton, the sun, the Eiffel Tower} and {Santa Claus, Mickey\nMouse, the round square}. Choice of vocabulary here is controversial:\nLet us suppose (for the sake of example) that the right thing to say\nis that the former things exist and the latter do not. Under this\nsupposition, \u2018existent\u2019 will not be a suitable\nsubstitution instance for F\u2014obviously, since we all agree that\nthere is no existent round square. Of course, nothing hangs on the\nchoice of \u2018existent\u2019 as the crucial piece of vocabulary.\nThe point is that non-theists are not prepared to include god(s) in\nthe former group of objects\u2014and hence will be unpersuaded by any\nargument which tries to use whatever vocabulary is used to\ndiscriminate between the two classes as the basis for an argument that\ngod(s) belong to the former group. (Cognoscenti will recognise that\nthe crucial point is that Meinongian ontological arguments fail to\nrespect the distinction between nuclear (assumptible, characterising)\nproperties and non-nuclear (non-assumptible, non-characterising)\nproperties. It should, of course, be noted that neither Meinong, nor\nany of his well-known modern supporters\u2014e.g. Terence Parsons,\nRichard Sylvan\u2014ever endorses a Meinongian ontological argument;\nand it should also be noted that most motivate the distinction between\nnuclear and non-nuclear properties in part by a need to avoid\nMeinongian ontological arguments. The reason for calling these\narguments \u201cMeinongian\u201d is that they rely on quantification\nover\u2014or reference to\u2014non-existent objects; there is no\npejorative intent in the use of this label.)\n\n(5) Experiential arguments: These are arguments which try to make use\nof \u2018externalist\u2019 or \u2018object-involving\u2019\naccounts of content. It should not be surprising that they fail. After\nall, those accounts of content need to have something to say about\nexpressions which fail to refer (\u2018Santa Claus\u2019,\n\u2018phlogiston\u2019, etc.). But, however the account goes,\nnon-theists will insist that expressions which purport to refer to\ngod(s) should be given exactly the same kind of treatment.\n\n(6) Mereological arguments: Those who dislike mereology will not be\nimpressed by these arguments. However, even those who accept\nprinciples of unrestricted composition\u2014i.e., who accept\nprinciples which claim, e.g., that, whenever there are some things,\nthere is something which is the sum or fusion of all of those\nthings\u2014need not be perturbed by them: for it is plausible to\nthink that the conclusions of these arguments have no religious\nsignificance whatsoever\u2014they are merely arguments for, e.g., the\nexistence of the physical universe.\n\n(7) Higher-Order arguments: The key to these arguments is the\nobservation that any collection of properties, that (a) does not\ninclude all properties and (b) is closed under entailment, is possibly\njointly instantiated. If it is impossible that God exists \u2014 as\nall who deny that God exists suppose, on the further assumption that,\nwere God to exist, God would exist of necessity \u2014 then it cannot\nbe true both that the God-properties are closed under entailment and\nthat there are properties that are not God-properties. Those who take\nthemselves to have good independent reason to deny that there are any\ngods will take themselves to have good independent reason to deny that\nthere are God-properties that form a non-trivial collection that is\nclosed under entailment.\n\nEven if the forgoing analyses are correct, it is important to note\nthat no argument has been given for the conclusion that no ontological\nargument can be successful. Even if all of the kinds of\narguments produced to date are pretty clearly unsuccessful\u2014i.e.,\nnot such as ought to give non-theists reason to accept the conclusion\nthat God exists\u2014it remains an open question whether there is\nsome other kind of hitherto undiscovered ontological argument which\ndoes succeed. (Perhaps it is worth adding here that there is fairly\nwidespread consensus, even amongst theists, that no known ontological\narguments for the existence of God are persuasive. Most categories of\nontological argument have some actual defenders; but none has a large\nfollowing.)\n\nMany other objections to (some) ontological arguments have been\nproposed. All of the following have been alleged to be the key to the\nexplanation of the failure of (at least some) ontological arguments:\n(1) existence is not a predicate (see, e.g., Kant, Smart 1955, Alston\n1960); (2) the concept of god is meaningless/incoherent/ inconsistent\n(see, e.g., Findlay 1949); (3) ontological arguments are ruled out by\n\u201cthe missing explanation argument\u201d (see Johnston 1992; (4)\nontological arguments all trade on mistaken uses of singular terms\n(see, e.g., Barnes 1972; (5) existence is not a perfection (see almost\nany textbook in philosophy of religion); (6) ontological arguments\npresuppose a Meinongian approach to ontology (see, e.g., Dummett\n1993); and (7) ontological arguments are question-begging, i.e.,\npresuppose what they set out to prove (see, e.g., Rowe 1989). There\nare many things to say about these objections: the most important\npoint is that almost all of them require far more controversial\nassumptions than non-theists require in order to be able to reject\nontological arguments with good conscience. Trying to support most of\nthese claims merely in order to beat up on ontological arguments is\nlike using a steamroller to crack a nut (in circumstances in which one\nis unsure that one can get the steamroller to move!).\n\nOf course, all of the above discussion is directed merely to the claim\nthat ontological arguments are not dialectically\nefficacious\u2014i.e., they give reasonable non-theists no reason to\nchange their views. It might be wondered whether there is some other\nuse which ontological arguments have\u2014e.g., as Plantinga claims,\nin establishing the reasonableness of theism. This seems unlikely.\nAfter all, at best these arguments show that certain sets of sentences\n(beliefs, etc.) are inconsistent\u2014one cannot reject the\nconclusions of these arguments while accepting their premises. But the\narguments themselves say nothing about the reasonableness of accepting\nthe premisses. So the arguments themselves say nothing about the\n(unconditional) reasonableness of accepting the conclusions of these\narguments. Those who are disposed to think that theism is irrational\nneed find nothing in ontological arguments to make them change their\nminds (and those who are disposed to think that theism is true should\ntake no comfort from them either).\n",
