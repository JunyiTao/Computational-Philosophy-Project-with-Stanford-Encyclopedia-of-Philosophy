    "main_text": "Minority Cultural Rights Claims || Cultural defense rights\n2.7 Cultural defense rights\n\nIn legal environments, wrong-doers sometimes deploy a cultural\ndefense, explaining that minority cultural norms and values, which are\nin tension with those of the majority, are causally relevant in\nexplaining why they committed a\u00a0wrong. A cultural defense has,\nthereby, sometimes been treated as a relevant mitigating factor in\nassigning punishment. The right to offer a cultural defense is\ntypically justified with respect to the importance of recognizing that\nminorities do not always operate according to the same values and\nnorms that are represented in the majority\u2019s legal system, and\nthat these differences are entitled to some consideration in legal\nspaces. Earlier court decisions accepted explanations that, for\nexample, men who murdered their unfaithful partners were moved to do\nso by a combination of shame and rage associated with cultural norms.\nFor example, men who claimed that \u201cgang rape\u201d (known\nculturally as marriage by capture) was mandated by Hmong culture as a\nway to secure a wife, in which women were not only complicit but in\nfact willing partners, are no longer understood to have a defense in\nlegal suits accusing them of rape (Song 2005). However, the power of\n\u201ccultural\u201d explanations in mainstream legal spaces has\ndecreased over time, as states have come to see how many of these\ndefenses are in fact cover for patriarchal, misogynist attitudes that\npersist, both in some minority communities and in the wider\ncommunity.\n\n\u201cCultural\u201d defenses of crime often amount to treating\nculture as though it were a homogeneous whole, and as though\nperpetrators of crime rather than its victims have a lock on its\ninterpretation. But \u201crespect for culture cannot mean deference\nto whatever the established authorities of culture deem right\u201d\n(Gutmann 2003: 46). Additionally, a generic imperative to\n\u201crespect culture\u201d in legal spaces can ignore the\ndifferences among types of cultural expectations, which can range from\npermissible acts, to encouraged acts and required acts, only some of\nwhich may justifiably be treated as legally relevant\u00a0(Vitikainen\n2015: 162). As well, it\u00a0can permit and encourage the\nrepresentation of minority (especially non-western) cultures as\nstereotypes, and \u201cmobilizes culture in ways that encourage\nabsurdly large generalizations about people from particular cultural\ngroups\u201d (Phillips 2007: 81 & 99). The danger represented by\nan uncritical acceptance of the cultural defense is in a treatment of\nculture as so encompassing that it treats its members as incapable of\nautonomous decision-making. But, say critics of the cultural defense,\nthis is a mistake\u2014along with many other factors, culture can be\npart of an explanation for engaging in wrong-doing, but should\n\u201cnever be mistaken for the whole truth\u201d (Phillips 2007:\n98).\n",
