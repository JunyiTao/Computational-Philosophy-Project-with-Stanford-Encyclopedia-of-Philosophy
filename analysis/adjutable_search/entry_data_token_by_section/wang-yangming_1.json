    "main_text": "Intellectual Context\n2. Intellectual Context \nDuring Wang\u2019s lifetime, the dominant intellectual movement was\nNeo\u2013Confucianism (in Chinese, D\u00e0oxu\u00e9, or\nthe Learning of the Way).  Neo\u2013Confucianism traces its origins\nto Han Yu and Li Ao in the late Tang dynasty (618\u2013906), but it\nonly came to intellectual maturity in the Song and Southern Song\ndynasties (960\u20131279), with the theorizing of Zhou Dunyi, Zhang\nZai, Cheng Yi, his brother Cheng Hao, and Zhu Xi.\nNeo\u2013Confucianism originally developed as a Confucian reaction\nagainst Buddhism.  Ironically, though, the Neo\u2013Confucians were\ndeeply influenced by Buddhism and adopted many key Buddhists concepts,\nincluding the notions that the diverse phenomena of the universe are\nmanifestations of some underlying unity, and that selfishness is the\nfundamental vice.  \nZhu Xi synthesized the thought of earlier Neo\u2013Confucians, and\nhis interpretation of the Four Books became the basis of the civil\nservice examinations (see Section 1, above).  Zhu held that everything\nin existence has two aspects, Pattern and q\u00ec.  Pattern\n(l\u01d0, also translated \u201cprinciple\u201d) is the\nunderlying structure of the universe.  Qi is the\nspatio\u2013temporal stuff that constitutes concrete objects.  The\ncomplete Pattern is fully present in each entity in the universe;\nhowever, entities are individuated by having distinct allotments of\nqi (variously translated as \u201cether,\u201d\n\u201cpsychophysical stuff,\u201d \u201cvital fluid,\u201d\n\u201cmaterial force,\u201d and others).  In addition to having\nspatio\u2013temporal location, qi has qualitative\ndistinctions, described metaphorically in terms of degrees of\n\u201cclarity\u201d and \u201cturbidity.\u201d The more\n\u201cclear\u201d the qi, the greater the extent to which\nthe Pattern manifests.  This explains how speciation is possible.  For\nexample, plants have more \u201cclear\u201d qi than do\nrocks, which is reflected in the more complex repertoire of\ninteractions plants have with their environments.\nNeo\u2013Confucian metaphysics, ethics, and philosophical\npsychology are systematically connected.  Humans have the most clear\nqi of any being.  However, some humans have especially clear\nqi, and as a result manifest the virtues, while others have\ncomparatively turbid qi, and therefore are prone to vice.\nThe state of one\u2019s qi is not fixed, though.  Through ethical\ncultivation, any human can clarify his qi, and thereby become\nmore virtuous.  Similarly, through laxness, one can allow one\u2019s\nqi to morally deteriorate.  Because the Pattern is fully\npresent in each human, everyone has complete innate ethical knowledge.\nHowever, due to the obscurations of qi, the manifestations of\nthis knowledge are sporadic and inconsistent.  Thus, a king who shows\nbenevolence when he takes pity on an ox being led to slaughter and\nspares it may fail to show benevolence in his treatment of his own\nsubjects (Mengzi 1A7).  Similarly, a person might manifest\nrighteousness when he disdains to even consider an illicit sexual\nrelationship; however, the same person might see nothing shameful\nabout flattering the worst traits and most foolish policies of a ruler\nwhom he serves (Mengzi 3B3). Because humans all share the\nsame Pattern, we are parts of a potentially harmonious whole.  In some\nsense, we form \u201cone body\u201d with other humans and the rest\nof the universe.  Consequently, the fundamental human virtue is\nbenevolence, which involves recognition of our shared nature with\nothers.[3]\nCorrespondingly, the fundamental vice is selfishness.  Cheng Hao uses\na medical metaphor to explain the relationship between ethics and\npersonal identity:\n\nA medical text describes numbness of the hands and feet as being\n\u201cunfeeling.\u201d This expression describes it perfectly.\nBenevolent people regard Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things as one\nSubstance.  Nothing is not oneself.  If you recognize something as\nyourself, there are no limits to how far [your compassion] will go.\nBut if you do not identify something as part of yourself, you will\nhave nothing to do with it.  This is like how, when hands and feet are\n\u201cunfeeling,\u201d the qi does not flow and one does\nnot identify them as part of oneself. (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014,\n201)\n\nJust as those whose hands and feet are \u201cunfeeling\u201d are\nnot bothered by injuries to their own limbs, so do those who are\nethically \u201cunfeeling\u201d fail to show concern for other\nhumans.  In both cases, one fails to act appropriately because one\nfails to recognize that something is a part of oneself.\nNeo\u2013Confucians regarded the ancient philosopher Mencius (4th\ncentury BCE) as having presented an especially incisive interpretation\nof Confucianism.  They referred to him as the \u201cSecond\nSage,\u201d second in importance only to Confucius himself, and often\nappealed to his vocabulary, arguments, and \nexamples.[4] \n In particular,\nNeo\u2013Confucians adopted Mencius\u2019s view that human nature is good,\nand that wrongdoing is the result of humans ignoring the promptings of\ntheir innate virtues.  Physical desires are one of the primary causes\nfor the failure to heed one\u2019s innate moral sense.  There is nothing\nintrinsically immoral about desires for fine food, sex, wealth, etc.,\nbut we will be led to wrongdoing if we pursue them without giving\nthought to the well\u2013being of others (Mengzi 6A15).\nNeo\u2013Confucians also adopted Mencius\u2019s list of four cardinal\nvirtues: benevolence, righteousness, wisdom, and propriety.\nBenevolence is manifested in the emotion of compassion, which involves\nsympathizing with the suffering of others and acting appropriately on\nthat sympathy.  For instance, a benevolent ruler could never be\nindifferent to the well\u2013being of his subjects, and would work\ntirelessly to alleviate their suffering. Righteousness is manifested\nin the emotion of disdain or shame at the thought of doing what is\ndishonorable, especially in the face of temptations of wealth or\nphysical desire.  For example, a righteous person would not cheat at a\ngame, or accept a bribe.  Wisdom is manifested in approval or\ndisapproval that reflects sound judgment about means\u2013end\ndeliberation and about the character of others.  Thus, a wise official\nwould know which policies to support and which to oppose, and would be\ninventive in devising solutions to complex problems.  Propriety is\nmanifested in respect or deference toward elders and legitimate\nauthorities, particularly as expressed in ceremonies or etiquette.\nFor instance, a person with propriety would willingly defer to elder\nfamily members most of the time, but would be motivated to serve a\nguest before his elder brother.  \nThe preceding views are shared, in broad outline, by all\nNeo\u2013Confucian philosophers.  The primary issue they debated was\nthe proper method of ethical cultivation.  In other words, how is it\npossible for us to consistently and reliably access and act on our\ninnate ethical knowledge?  Other disagreements among them (on\nseemingly recondite issues of metaphysics and the interpretation of\nthe Confucian classics) can often be traced to more fundamental\ndisagreements over ethical cultivation.  For Zhu Xi, almost all humans\nare born with qi that is so turbid that it is impossible for\nthem to consistently know what is virtuous and act accordingly without\nexternal assistance.  The remedy is carefully studying the classics\nwritten by the ancient sages, ideally under the guidance of a wise\nteacher.  Although the classics were written in response to concrete\nhistorical situations, their words allow us to grasp the Pattern at a\ncertain level of abstraction from its instantiations.  However, Zhu Xi\nstates that merely understanding the Pattern is insufficient for the\nexercise of virtue.  One must achieve Sincerity\n(ch\u00e9ng), a continual awareness of moral knowledge in\nthe face of \ntemptations.[5] \nIn his own lifetime, Zhu Xi\u2019s leading critic was Lu Xiangshan\n(1139\u20131193).  Lu argued that, because the Pattern is fully\npresent in the mind of each human, it is not necessary to engage in an\nintellectually demanding process of study in order to recover one\u2019s\nmoral knowledge:\n\nRighteousness and Pattern are in the minds of human beings.  As a\nmatter of fact, these are what Heaven has endowed us with, and they\ncan never be effaced or eliminated [from our minds].  If one becomes\nobsessed with [desires for] things and reaches the point where one\nviolates Pattern and transgresses righteousness, usually this is\nsimply because one fails to reflect upon these things [i.e., the\nrighteousness and Pattern that lie within one].  If one truly is able\nto turn back and reflect upon these things, then what is right and\nwrong and what one should cleave to and what one should subtly reject\nwill begin to stir, separate, become clear, and leave one resolute and\nwithout doubts. (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014, 251\u201352, glosses in\noriginal translation)\n\nIn emphasizing the innate human capacity for moral judgment, Lu\nadopted the phrase \u201cpure knowing\u201d from Mengzi\n7A15.  In its original context, Mencius writes that \u201cAmong babes\nin arms there are none that do not know to love their parents,\u201d\nand describes this as an instance of \u201cpure knowing,\u201d which\nhumans \u201cknow without pondering\u201d (Tiwald and Van Norden\n2014, 218).  Lu explains:\n\nPure knowing lies within human beings; although some people become\nmired in dissolution, pure knowing still remains undiminished and\nenduring [within them]. \u2026 Truly, if they can turn back and seek\nafter it, then, without needing to make a concerted effort, what is\nright and wrong, what is fine and foul, will become exceedingly clear,\nand they will decide for themselves what to like and dislike, what to\npursue and what to abandon. (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014, 252)\n\nAlthough there were always Confucians like Lu who disagreed with\nZhu Xi, the latter\u2019s interpretation became dominant after the\ngovernment sponsored it as the official interpretation for the civil\nservice examinations.  By the time of Wang Yangming, Zhu Xi\u2019s approach\nhad ossified into a stale orthodoxy that careerists mindlessly\nparroted in an effort to pass the examinations.\n",
