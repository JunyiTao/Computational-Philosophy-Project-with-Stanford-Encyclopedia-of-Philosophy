    "main_text": "\n\nNon-cognitivism is a variety of irrealism about ethics with a number\nof influential variants. Non-cognitivists agree with error theorists\nthat there are no moral properties or moral facts. But rather than\nthinking that this makes moral statements false, non-cognitivists\nclaim that moral statements are not in the business of predicating\nproperties or making statements which could be true or false in any\nsubstantial sense. Roughly put, non-cognitivists think that moral\nstatements have no substantial truth conditions. Furthermore,\naccording to non-cognitivists, when people utter moral sentences they\nare not typically expressing states of mind which are beliefs or which\nare cognitive in the way that beliefs are. Rather they are expressing\nnon-cognitive attitudes more similar to desires, approval or\ndisapproval.\n\nCognitivism is the denial of non-cognitivism. Thus it holds that moral\nstatements do express beliefs and that they are apt for truth and\nfalsity. But cognitivism need not be a species of realism since a\ncognitivist can be an error theorist and think all moral statements\nfalse. Still, moral realists are cognitivists insofar as they think\nmoral statements are apt for robust truth and falsity and that many of\nthem are in fact true.\n",
