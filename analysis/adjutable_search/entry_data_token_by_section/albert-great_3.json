    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n4. Metaphysics\n\n\nAlbert\u2019s metaphysics is an adaptation of Aristotelian\nmetaphysics as conditioned by a form of Neo-Platonism. His reading the\nLiber de causis as an authentic Aristotelian text influenced\nhis understanding of Aristotle. It seems that Albert never realized the\nNeo-Platonic origin of the work. As with the other works of Aristotle\nhe prepared a paraphrase of the work entitled De causis et processu\nuniversitatis, and used it as a guide to interpreting other works\nby Aristotle. However, he also used the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius to\ncorrect some of the doctrine found in the Liber de causis.\n\n\nAlbert blends these three main sources of his metaphysics into a\nhierarchical structure of reality in which there is an emanation of\nforms directed by what Albert calls \u201ca summoning of the\ngood\u201d (advocatio boni). The good operates metaphysically\nas the final cause of the order of forms in the universe of beings. But\nit is also the First Cause. And its operation in the created order of\nbeing is discovered as an attraction of all being back to itself.\n\u201cWe exist because God is good,\u201d Albert explains, \u201cand\n we are good insofar as we\n exist.\u201d[6]\n Thus the balanced relations of the exit and return of all things\naccording to classical Neo-Platonism is skewed in favor of the\nrelationship of return. This is because Albert, as a Christian\nphilosopher, favors a creationist view of being over the doctrine of\npure emanation. Rejecting also the doctrine of universal hylomorphism\nAlbert argues that material beings are always composite in which the\nforms are inchoate until they are called forth by the ultimate\ngood. Spiritual creatures (excluding man) have no material\nelement. Their being summoned to the good is immediate and final. The\nsummoning of the inchoate forms of material beings, however, is not\ndirect. It depends upon the intervention of the celestial spheres.\n\n\nThe First Cause, which Albert understands as God, is an absolutely\ntranscendent reality. His uncreated light calls forth a hierarchically\nordered universe in which each order of being reflects this light.\nGod\u2019s giving existence to creatures is understood by Albert as\n their procession from him as from a first\n cause.[7]\n At the top of this hierarchy of light are found the purely spiritual\nbeings, the angelic orders and the intelligences. Albert carefully\ndistinguishes these two kinds of beings. He basically accepts the\nanalysis of the angelic orders as found in Pseudo-Dionysius\u2019 treatise\nof the celestial hierarchy. The intelligences move the cosmic spheres\nand illuminate the human soul. The intelligences, just as the order of\nangels, form a special hierarchy. The First Intelligence, as Albert\ncalls it, contemplates the entire universe and uses the human soul, as\nilluminated by the lower intelligences, to draw all creatures into a\nunity.\n\n\nBeneath the angels and intelligences are the souls that possess\nintellects. They are joined to bodies but do not depend on bodies for\ntheir existence. Although they are ordered to the First Intelligence\nso as to enjoin contemplative unity on the entire cosmos, Albert\nrejects the Averroistic theory of the unity of the intellect. Each\nhuman soul has its own intellect. But because the human soul uniquely\nstands on the horizon of both material and spiritual being it can\noperate as a microcosm and thus can serve the purpose of the First\nIntelligence, which is to bind all creatures into a universe.\n\n\nFinally there are the immersed forms. Under this heading Albert\nestablishes another hierarchy with the animal kingdom at the top,\nfollowed by the plant kingdom, then the world of minerals (in which\nAlbert had a deep interest), and finally the elements of material\ncreation.\n\n\nOne important aspect of Albert\u2019s metaphysics appears in his\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019 Metaphysics. In this work\nAlbert relies heavily on both Averroes in his Long Commentary on\nthe Metaphysics and Avicenna\u2019s Philosophia\nprima. While the commentary of Averroes is an almost literal\nanalysis of the text of Aristotle, Avicenna\u2019s analysis often\ndeparts from this literal approach and incorporates ideas that\nAvicenna found in Aristotle\u2019s Posterior\nAnalytics. Albert seems to be using Averroes when he is\nparaphrasing Aristotle\u2019s text, but relies on Avicenna when he\ndeparts from the paraphrasing. As a result of this usage Albert\nproceeds to develop his own ideas of first philosophy as outlined\nabove. This can be seen for example in his analysis of the fifth book\nof the Metaphysics in his digression on unity found in\ntractate 1, chapter 8. Following Avicenna he argues that unity cannot\nbe an essential feature of any substance.\n",
