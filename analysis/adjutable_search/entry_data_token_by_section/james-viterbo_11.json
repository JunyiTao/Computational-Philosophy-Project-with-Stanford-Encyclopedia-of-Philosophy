    "main_text": "Ethics || Freedom of the Will\n7.1 Freedom of the Will\n\nThe scholastics all agreed that the human will is free. They also\nagreed that the will and the intellect both played a role in the\ngenesis of the voluntary act. What they disagreed about was which of\nthe two faculties had the decisive role. For Henry of Ghent, the will\nwas the sole cause of its free acts (Quodl. I, q. 17), so\nmuch so that he tended to relegate the intellect\u2019s role to that\nof a \u201csine qua non\u201d cause. At the other end of the\nspectrum of opinions, Godfrey of Fontaines held that the will is\nalways passive in regard to the intellect and that it is the intellect\nthat exercises the decisive motion in producing the voluntary act\n(Quodl. III, q. 16). Although James of Viterbo used language\napt to suggest that he wanted to steer a middle course between Henry\nand Godfrey (Quodl. II, q. 7), his preferences clearly lay\nwith a position like that of Henry\u2019s, as can be gathered from\nhis most detailed treatment of the question in Quodl. I, q. 7\n(see Dumont 2018a for a complete treatment of the issue in James).\n\nJames\u2019 thesis in Quodl. I, q. 7 was that the will both\nmoves itself and is moved by another. An agent that is moved by\nanother can be said to be free as long as it also moves itself in some\nway. The human will is just such an agent: it is moved by itself; but\nit is also moved by another, namely by the object of willing outside\nthe soul, and it is moved by that same object insofar as it is\napprehended by the intellect. To explain how this was so, James used\nAquinas\u2019 distinction between the specification of an act of will\n(the will\u2019s willing this as opposed to that) and the exercise of\nthe act (the will\u2019s actually willing this). The will formally\nmoves itself in regard to the exercise of its act; it is moved by the\nobject outside the soul in regard to the specification of its act; and\nit is moved by the intellect, or more precisely by the object as\napprehended by the intellect, both in regard to the specification and\nthe exercise of its act. James called the motion by which the will was\nspecified by the object as apprehended by the intellect\n\u201cmetaphorical\u201d motion, as distinct from\n\u201cproper\u201d motion. Final causes were metaphorical movers in\nthis sense. James called the motion by which the will is moved to its\nexercise by the object as apprehended by the intellect\nefficient motion. This is prima facie a surprising\nmove given what we know about James\u2019 theory of the soul as a\nself-mover. For even though James was keen to show that the will\ncannot, so to speak, \u201cgo it alone,\u201d did not making the\nobject as understood by the intellect the efficient cause of the\nwill\u2019s exercise to act risk tilting the causal balance too far\nin the direction of the intellect? But in fact if the intellect was an\nefficient cause, it wasn\u2019t so in the usual sense of the word\n\u201cefficient.\u201d James claimed to follow Aristotle in\nMetaphysics in distinguishing two ways in which something\ncould be moved efficiently. The first was through direct efficient\ncausation; in this sense, only God was the efficient cause of the\nwill\u2019s motion. The second sense was through \u201ca certain\nconnection\u201d that obtains between two things that are rooted in\nthe same subject. It is this second sense that is relevant for\nunderstanding how the intellect moves the will. As James understood\nthe matter, \u201cbecause the will and the intellect are rooted and\nconnected in the same essence of the soul, it follows that when the\nsoul is in actuality in relation to the intellect, there arises\n(fit) in the soul a certain inclination such that it becomes\nin actuality in relation to the will, with the result that (the will)\nmoves itself.\u201d It is, he concluded, \u201con account of that\ninclination that the intellect moves the will;\u201d and the motion\nby which it does so can be termed a \u201crousing up\u201d\n(excitatio) ( Quodl. I, q. 7, p. 104,\n849\u2013855). \n\nThus, despite what the language of \u201cefficiency\u201d might\nsuggest, James\u2019 account of how the intellect moves the will is\nsimilar to his account of how the sense organ moves the power of sense\nand how the imagination moves the intellect: in all three cases the\nmotion is of the \u201cexcitatory\u201d variety; the power itself as\nthe formal cause of its acts supplies the lion\u2019s share of the\nvoluntary act\u2019s causality. If anything, the will itself can be\nconsidered to be an efficient cause (in the first sense of the word),\nif only per accidens. This is because the will, like heavy\nobjects but unlike the intellect and the senses, belongs to the class\nof things that both move themselves formally and move others\nefficiently. Thus, just as a heavy object is formally self-moved as a\nresult of its heaviness but moves another efficiently inasmuch as it\ndivides the medium it traverses, so too the will is a self-mover that\nefficiently moves the intellect and the other faculties, and hence can\nbe said to move itself  per accidens (Quodl. I, q.\n7, p. 98, 633\u2013640). \n\nWhat is unclear is how any of the above makes the will\u2019s\nvolitions free. After all, by James\u2019 own admission, the senses\nand the intellect are also formal self-movers, and yet they are not\nfree. The difference is that whereas acts of sensation and\nintellection, given the self-motion of the senses and the intellect,\nwill necessarily follow upon the motions of the organs of sense and\nthe motion of the imagination, no act of willing according to James is\nnecessitated by the efficient causality (in James\u2019 sense of the\nword) of the intellect. Thus, although any act of willing must be\npreceded by an act of the intellect, no act of the intellect\nnecessarily entails a particular act of willing. This makes the will\nthe only power of the soul that is essentially free, though some other\npowers may be called free \u201cby participation,\u201d insofar as\nthey are apt to be moved by the will.
