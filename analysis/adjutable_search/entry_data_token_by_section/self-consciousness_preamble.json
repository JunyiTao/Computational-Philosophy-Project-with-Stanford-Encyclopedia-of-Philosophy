    "main_text": "\n\nHuman beings are conscious not only of the world around them but also\nof themselves: their activities, their bodies, and their mental lives.\nThey are, that is, self-conscious (or, equivalently, self-aware).\nSelf-consciousness can be understood as an awareness of oneself. But a\nself-conscious subject is not just aware of something that merely\nhappens to be themselves, as one is if one sees an old photograph\nwithout realising that it is of oneself. Rather a self-conscious\nsubject is aware of themselves as themselves; it is manifest\nto them that they themselves are the object of awareness.\nSelf-consciousness is a form of consciousness that is paradigmatically\nexpressed in English by the words \u201cI\u201d, \u201cme\u201d,\nand \u201cmy\u201d, terms that each of us uses to refer to ourselves\nas such.\n\nA central topic throughout the history of philosophy\u2014and\nincreasingly so since the seventeenth century\u2014the phenomena\nsurrounding self-consciousness prompt a variety of fundamental\nphilosophical and scientific questions, including its relation to\nconsciousness; its semantic and epistemic features; its realisation in\nboth conceptual and non-conceptual representation; and its connection\nto our conception of an objective world populated with others like\nourselves.\n",
