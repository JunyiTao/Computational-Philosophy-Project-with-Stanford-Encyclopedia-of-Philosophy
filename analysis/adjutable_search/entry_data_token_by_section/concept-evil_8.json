    "main_text": "The History of Theories of Evil || Arendt\u2019s Analyses of Evil\n2.3 Arendt\u2019s Analyses of Evil\n\nSecular analyses of the concept of evil in the narrow sense began in\nthe twentieth century with the work of Hanna Arendt. Arendt\u2019s\nthoughts on the nature of evil stem from her attempt to understand and\nevaluate the horrors of the Nazi death camps. In the Origins of\nTotalitarianism (1951), Arendt borrows Kant\u2019s term\n\u2018radical evil\u2019 to describe the evil of the Holocaust.\nHowever, Arendt does not mean what Kant means by \u2018radical\nevil\u2019 (see section 2.2 for Kant\u2019s view of radical evil).\nInstead, Arendt uses the term to denote a new form of wrongdoing which\ncannot be captured by other moral concepts. For Arendt, radical evil\ninvolves making human beings as human beings superfluous. This is\naccomplished when human beings are made into living corpses who lack\nany spontaneity or freedom. According to Arendt a distinctive feature\nof radical evil is that it isn\u2019t done for humanly understandable\nmotives such as self-interest, but merely to reinforce totalitarian\ncontrol and the idea that everything is possible (Arendt 1951,\n437\u2013459; Bernstein 2002, 203\u2013224).\n\nIn Origins of Totalitarianism Arendt\u2019s analysis of evil\nfocuses on evils which results from systems put in place by\ntotalitarian regimes. Her analysis does not address the character and\nculpability of individuals who take part in the perpetration of evil.\nIn Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil,\nArendt turns her attention to individual culpability for evil through\nher analysis of the Nazi functionary Adolf Eichmann who was tried in\nJerusalem for organizing the deportation and transportation of Jews to\nthe Nazi concentration and extermination camps. Arendt went to\nJerusalem in 1961 to report on Eichmann\u2019s trial for The New\nYorker magazine. In Eichmann in Jerusalem, she argues\nthat \u201cdesk murderers\u201d such as Eichmann were not motivated\nby demonic or monstrous motives. Instead, \u201cIt was sheer\nthoughtlessness\u2014something by no means identical with\nstupidity\u2014that predisposed [Eichmann] to become one of the\ngreatest criminals of that period\u201d (Arendt 1963, 287\u2013288).\nAccording to Arendt, Eichmann\u2019s motives and character were banal\nrather than monstrous. She describes him as a \u201cterrifyingly\nnormal\u201d human being who simply did not think very deeply about\nwhat he was doing.\n\nArendt\u2019s reflections on Eichmann and her concept of the banality\nof evil have been both influential and controversial (For theorists\nwho believe Arendt\u2019s thoughts are particularly pertinent today,\nsee Bar On 2012 and Bernstein 2008. For a discussion of the\ncontroversy see Young-Bruehl 1982). Some theorists take Arendt\u2019s\nthesis of the banality of evil as a datum to be explained. For\ninstance, social psychologists Stanley Milgram (1974) and Philip\nZimbardo (2007) have attempted to explain how social conditions can\nlead ordinary people to perform evil actions. Others have contested\nArendt\u2019s suggestion that ordinary people can be regular sources\nof evil (see Card 2010; Calder 2003 and 2009).\n\nThere is also controversy concerning the relationship between\nArendt\u2019s notions of radical and banal evil. In a letter she\nwrote to Gershom Scholem in response to some critical\ncomments he made about Eichmann in Jerusalem, Arendt\nwrites \u201cYou are completely right that I have changed my mind and\nno longer speak of radical evil\u201d (Arendt and Scholem 2017, 209). This\nsuggests that by the time Arendt wrote Eichmann in\nJerusalem she had abandoned the notion of radical evil.\nHowever, several Arendt scholars reject this view (Berstein 2002;\nBirmingham 2019). For example, Peg Birmingham argues that \u201cArendt\nnever wavers in her claim that extreme [or radical] evil is the\nsystematic production of perfect superfluousness\u201d (Birmingham 2019,\n160). According to Birmingham, \u201c[Arendt\u2019s] account of the\nbanality of evil is an account of the production of the moral\nthoughtlessness that is concomitant with [radical evil]. They are\ninterdependent\u201d (Birmingham 2019, 160). \n",
