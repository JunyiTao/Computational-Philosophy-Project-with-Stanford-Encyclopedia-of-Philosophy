    "main_text": "The ethics of neuroscience\n2. The ethics of neuroscience\n\nNeuroethics is driven by neurotechnologies: it is concerned with the\nethical questions that attend the development and effects of novel\nneurotechnologies, as well as other ethical and philosophical issues\nthat arise from our growing understanding of how brains give rise to\nthe people that we are and the social structures that we inhabit and\ncreate. These questions are intimately bound up with scientific\nquestions about what kinds of knowledge can be acquired with\nparticular techniques: what are the scope and limits of what a\ntechnique can tell us? With many new techniques, answers to these\nquestions are obscure not only to the lay public, but often to the\nscientists themselves. The uncertainty about the reach of these\ntechnologies adds to the challenge of grappling with the ethical\nissues raised.\n\nMany new neurotechnologies enable us to monitor brain processes and\nincreasingly, to understand how the brain gives rise to certain\nbehaviors; others enable us to intervene in these processes, to change\nand perhaps to control behaviors, traits, or abilities. Although it\nwill be impossible to fully canvass the range of questions neuroethics\nhas thus far contemplated, discussion of the issues raised by a few\nneurotechnologies will allow me to illustrate the range of questions\nneuroethics entertains. The following is a not-exhaustive list of\ntopics that fall under the general rubric of neuroethics.\n",
