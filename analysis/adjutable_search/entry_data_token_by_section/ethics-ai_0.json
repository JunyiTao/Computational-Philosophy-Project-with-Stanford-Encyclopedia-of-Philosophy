    "main_text": "Introduction || Background of the Field\n1.1 Background of the Field\n\nThe ethics of AI and robotics is often focused on\n\u201cconcerns\u201d of various sorts, which is a typical response\nto new technologies. Many such concerns turn out to be rather quaint\n(trains are too fast for souls); some are predictably wrong when they\nsuggest that the technology will fundamentally change humans\n(telephones will destroy personal communication, writing will destroy\nmemory, video cassettes will make going out redundant); some are\nbroadly correct but moderately relevant (digital technology will\ndestroy industries that make photographic film, cassette tapes, or\nvinyl records); but some are broadly correct and deeply relevant (cars\nwill kill children and fundamentally change the landscape). The task\nof an article such as this is to analyse the issues and to deflate the\nnon-issues.\n\nSome technologies, like nuclear power, cars, or plastics, have caused\nethical and political discussion and significant policy efforts to\ncontrol the trajectory these technologies, usually only once some\ndamage is done. In addition to such \u201cethical concerns\u201d,\nnew technologies challenge current norms and conceptual systems, which\nis of particular interest to philosophy. Finally, once we have\nunderstood a technology in its context, we need to shape our societal\nresponse, including regulation and law. All these features also exist\nin the case of new AI and Robotics technologies\u2014plus the more\nfundamental fear that they may end the era of human control on\nEarth.\n\nThe ethics of AI and robotics has seen significant press coverage in\nrecent years, which supports related research, but also may end up\nundermining it: the press often talks as if the issues under\ndiscussion were just predictions of what future technology will bring,\nand as though we already know what would be most ethical and how to\nachieve that. Press coverage thus focuses on risk, security (Brundage\net al. 2018, in the\n Other Internet Resources\n section below, hereafter [OIR]), and prediction of impact (e.g., on\nthe job market). The result is a discussion of essentially technical\nproblems that focus on how to achieve a desired outcome. Current\ndiscussions in policy and industry are also motivated by image and\npublic relations, where the label \u201cethical\u201d is really not\nmuch more than the new \u201cgreen\u201d, perhaps used for\n\u201cethics washing\u201d. For a problem to qualify as a problem\nfor AI ethics would require that we do not readily know what\nthe right thing to do is. In this sense, job loss, theft, or killing\nwith AI is not a problem in ethics, but whether these are permissible\nunder certain circumstances is a problem. This article\nfocuses on the genuine problems of ethics where we do not readily know\nwhat the answers are.\n\nA last caveat: The ethics of AI and robotics is a very young field\nwithin applied ethics, with significant dynamics, but few\nwell-established issues and no authoritative overviews\u2014though\nthere is a promising outline (European Group on Ethics in Science and\nNew Technologies 2018) and there are beginnings on societal impact\n(Floridi et al. 2018; Taddeo and Floridi 2018; S. Taylor et al. 2018;\nWalsh 2018; Bryson 2019; Gibert 2019; \nWhittlestone et al. 2019), and policy recommendations (AI HLEG 2019\n[OIR]; IEEE 2019). So this article cannot merely reproduce what the\ncommunity has achieved thus far, but must propose an ordering where\nlittle order exists.\n",
