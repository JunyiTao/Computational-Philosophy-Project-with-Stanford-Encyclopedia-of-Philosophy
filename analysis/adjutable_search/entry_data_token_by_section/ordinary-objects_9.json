    "main_text": "Against Conservative Ontologies || The Problem of the Many\n2.8 The Problem of the Many\n\nThe office appears to contain a single wooden desk. The desk is\nconstituted by a single hunk of wood whose surface forms a sharp\nboundary with the environment, without even a single cellulose\nmolecule coming loose from the others. Call this hunk of wood\n\u2018Woodrow\u2019. Now consider the object consisting of all of\nWoodrow\u2019s parts except for a single cellulose molecule,\n\u2018Molly\u2019, making up part of Woodrow\u2019s surface. Call\nthis ever-so-slightly smaller hunk of wood\n\u2018Woodrow-minus\u2019. Because Woodrow-minus is extraordinarily\nsimilar to Woodrow, there is considerable pressure to accept that\nWoodrow-minus is a desk as well. This, in short, is the problem of the\nmany.\n\n(PM1)\nWoodrow is a desk iff Woodrow-minus is a desk.\n(PM2)\nIf so, then it is not the case that there is exactly one desk in\nthe office.\n(PM3)\nThere is exactly one desk in the office.\n\n\nPM1 and PM2 straightforwardly entail that PM3 is false; one of these\nclaims has to\n go.[49]\n\nPM1 is plausible. Woodrow-minus seems to have everything that it takes\nto be a desk: it looks like a desk, it\u2019s shaped like a desk,\nit\u2019s got a flat writing surface, and so forth. Accordingly, it\nseems arbitrary to suppose that Woodrow but not Woodrow-minus is a\ndesk. Moreover, if Molly were removed, Woodrow-minus would certainly\nthen be a desk. But since Woodrow-minus doesn\u2019t itself undergo\nany interesting change when Molly is removed (after all, Molly\nisn\u2019t even part of Woodrow-minus), it stands to reason\nthat Woodrow-minus must likewise be a desk even while Molly is\nattached to it.\n\nOne might deny PM1 on the grounds that being a desk is a\n\u201cmaximal\u201d property, that is, a property of an object that\ncannot be shared by large parts of that object. Since Woodrow is a\ndesk, and since Woodrow-minus is a large part of Woodrow,\nWoodrow-minus is not a\n desk.[50]\n\n\nBut this style of response can be rendered unavailable by introducing\nan element of vagueness into our story. Suppose now that Molly has\nbegun to come loose from the other molecules, in such a way that it is\nnaturally described as being a borderline part of the desk in the\noffice. Let Woodrow-plus be the aggregate of cellulose molecules that\ndefinitely has Molly as a part. PM1 can then be replaced with\nPM1\u2032:\n\n(PM1\u2032)\nWoodrow-plus is a desk iff Woodrow-minus is a desk.\n\n\nWoodrow-plus and Woodrow-minus each seem to have everything that it\ntakes to be a desk, and neither seems to be a better candidate than\nthe other for being a desk. PM2 would then be replaced with\nPM2\u2032:\n\n(PM2\u2032)\nIf Woodrow-plus is a desk iff Woodrow-minus is a desk, then: it is\nnot the case that there is exactly one desk in the\n office.[51]\n\n\nPM1\u2032 can be resisted by proponents of the supervaluationist\nstrategy sketched in\n \u00a72.1\n above. The vague term \u2018desk\u2019 has multiple\nprecisifications, some of which apply to Woodrow-plus, some of which\napply to Woodrow-minus, but none of which applies to both.\nAccordingly, PM1\u2032 is false on some precisifications, and\ntherefore is not true\n simpliciter.[52]\n\n\nConstitutional pluralists can deny both PM2 and PM2\u2032. Regarding\nthe original story, they may insist that neither Woodrow nor\nWoodrow-minus is a desk. Each is a mere hunk of wood, and no mere hunk\nof wood is a desk. Rather, there is exactly one desk, it is\nconstituted by Woodrow, and while Woodrow-minus would constitute that\ndesk if Molly were removed, as things stand it constitutes nothing at\nall. Regarding the revised story, pluralists may again say that there\nis exactly one desk, neither Woodrow-plus nor Woodrow-minus is a desk,\nand it is simply indeterminate whether it is Woodrow-plus or\nWoodrow-minus that constitutes that desk. In that case, PM2\u2032 is\nfalse. It\u2019s true that each is a desk iff the other\nis\u2014since neither is a desk\u2014but it doesn\u2019t follow\nthat there\u2019s more than one or fewer than one\n desk.[53]\n\n\nFinally, one might deny PM3, either by accepting an eliminative view\non which there is no desk in the office or by accepting a permissive\nview on which there is more than one desk in the office. Proponents of\nthe latter response will end up committed to far more than two desks,\nhowever. By parity of reason, there will also be a desk composed of\nall of the cellulose molecules except Nelly (\u2260 Molly). Likewise for\nOllie. And so on. So there will be at least as many desks as there are\ncellulose molecules on the surface of the\n desk.[54]\n\n",
