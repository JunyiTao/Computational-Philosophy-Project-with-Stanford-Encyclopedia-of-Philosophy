    "main_text": "Other Topics Concerning Indexicals || Complex Demonstratives\n5.2 Complex Demonstratives\n\n\nComplex demonstratives are expressions of the form that \\(N\\)\nor this \\(N\\), where \\(N\\) is a common noun phrase. Examples\ninclude \u2018this man\u2019, \u2018that red car\u2019, and\n\u2018that woman who is wearing a blue coat\u2019. One major question\nabout complex demonstratives is whether they are singular\nterms or quantifier phrases. Singular terms are\nexpressions that refer, with respect to contexts, to individuals. Most\nsemantic theories of the simple demonstratives\n\u2018this\u2019 and \u2018that\u2019 treat them as singular terms.\nSpeakers seem to use complex demonstratives to refer to\nindividuals in much the way that they use simple demonstratives. That\nis some reason to think that complex demonstratives are singular terms.\nHowever, complex demonstratives syntactically resemble paradigmatic\nquantifier phrases, such as \u2018some woman\u2019 and \u2018every\nman\u2019. That is some reason to think that complex demonstratives\nare quantifier phrases. But quantifier phrases are not singular terms;\nthey do not refer, with respect to contexts, to individuals. Their\nreferences, or extensions, with respect to contexts, are usually taken\nto be sets of sets.\n\n\nSingular-term theories of complex demonstratives must deal with two\nmajor issues. First, do the common noun phrases that appear in complex\ndemonstratives play a role in determining their referents in contexts?\nSecond, do the contents of those common noun phrases contribute to the\ncontents of complex demonstratives, in contexts? (Does, for instance,\nthe content of \u2018philosopher\u2019 appear as a constituent of\nthe content of \u2018that philosopher\u2019, in a context?)\nMinimal theories assign minimal, or no, semantic role to\ncommon noun phrases in complex demonstratives. The common noun phrase\nmerely gives an auditor a clue as to the speaker\u2019s intended\nreferent. Since the predicate \u2018philosopher\u2019 plays no role\nin determining the referent of \u2018that philosopher\u2019 in a\ncontext, its referent, in a context, need not be a philosopher.\nFurthermore, the content of \u2018philosopher\u2019 is not a\nconstituent of the content of \u2018that philosopher\u2019 in a\ncontext; its content simply is its referent in that context. Larson\nand Segal (1995) endorse a minimal theory (but they do not accept the\nexistence of Kaplan-style contents). Intermediate theories\nsay that the common noun phrase helps determine the referent. So, an\nindividual must be a philosopher to be the referent of \u2018that\nphilosopher\u2019 in a context. But the common noun phrase does not\ncontribute its content to the complex demonstrative\u2019s content.\nInstead, the content of the complex demonstrative is simply its\nreferent. Kaplan (1989a) hints that he accepts an intermediate theory.\nBraun (1994, 2008), Borg (2000), and Salmon (2002) explicitly argue\nfor intermediate theories. Maximal theories say that the\ncommon noun phrase helps determine the referent, and its content\nappears as a constituent of the content, in a context. Richard (1993)\nendorses a maximal theory.\n\n\nThe arguments for and against these views are complicated. To take\none example: intermediate theorists might claim that (22) is false in\nsome contexts, and argue that this is incompatible with maximal\ntheories.\n\n(22)\n\nIt is a necessary truth that if that philosopher exists, then something is a philosopher.\n\n\n\nBut maximal theorists, if they agree with this judgment about (22),\ncan add rigidifying devices, such as \u2018actually\u2019, to obtain\nthis result.\n\n\nTaylor (1981), King (2001), and Neale (2004) endorse\nquantificational theories of complex demonstratives. For example, on\nKing\u2019s view, the content of (23), in some contexts in which the\nagent perceives Mary and believes Mary to be a philosopher, is\nnecessarily equivalent to the content of (24) in that same context\n(assuming that definite descriptions are quantifier phrases, not\nsingular terms).\n\n(23)\n\nThat philosopher was born in Boise.\n\n(24)\n\nThe individual that is actually a philosopher and is identical with\nMary was born in Boise.\n\n\n\nThe arguments for and against singular-term theories and quantifier\nphrase theories are (again) complicated. For example, King argues that\nintermediate singular-term theories of complex demonstratives have\ndifficulties dealing with cases of quantifying into complex\ndemonstratives, as in examples like (25) below.\n\n(25)\n\nEvery university professor cherishes that first publication of hers.\n\n\n\nBorg (2000), Lepore and Johnson (2002), Salmon (2002), and Braun\n(2008) respond to King\u2019s argument, and criticize his view. King\ndefends his argument, and his view, in King 2008a and 2008b.\n\n\nSee Lepore and Ludwig 2000, Dever 2001, Roberts 2002, and Elbourne\n2008 for views of complex demonstratives that do not fit easily into\nthe above classification scheme.\n",
