    "preamble": "\n\nJohn Dewey (1859\u20131952) was one of American pragmatism\u2019s\nearly founders, along with Charles Sanders Peirce and William James,\nand arguably the most prominent American intellectual for the first\nhalf of the twentieth century. Dewey\u2019s educational theories and\nexperiments had a global reach, his psychological theories had a\nsizable influence in that growing science, and his writings about\ndemocratic theory and practice deeply influenced debates in academic\nand practical quarters for decades. In addition, Dewey developed\nextensive and often systematic views in ethics, epistemology, logic,\nmetaphysics, aesthetics, and philosophy of religion. Because Dewey\ntypically took a genealogical approach that couched his own view\nwithin the larger history of philosophy, one may also find a fully\ndeveloped metaphilosophy in his work.\n\nDewey\u2019s pragmatism\u2014or, \u201ccultural naturalism\u201d,\nwhich he favored over \u201cpragmatism\u201d and\n\u201cinstrumentalism\u201d\u2014may be understood as a critique\nand reconstruction of philosophy within the larger ambit of a\nDarwinian worldview (Lamont 1961; MW4: 3). Following James\u2019\nlead, Dewey argued that philosophy had become an overly technical and\nintellectualistic discipline, divorced from assessing the social\nconditions and values dominating everyday life (FAE, LW5:\n157\u201358). He sought to reconnect philosophy with the mission of\neducation-for-living (philosophy as \u201cthe general theory of\neducation\u201d), a form of social criticism at the most general\nlevel, or \u201ccriticism of criticisms\u201d (EN, LW1:\n298; see also DE, MW9: 338).\n\nSet within the larger picture of Darwinian evolutionary theory,\nphilosophy should be seen as an activity undertaken by interdependent\norganisms-in-environments. This standpoint, of active adaptation, led\nDewey to criticize the tendency of traditional philosophies to\nabstract and reify concepts derived from living contexts. As did other\nclassical pragmatists, Dewey focused criticism upon traditional\ndualisms of metaphysics and epistemology (e.g., mind/body,\nnature/culture, self/society, and reason/emotion) and then\nreconstructed their elements as parts of larger continuities. For\nexample, human thinking is not a phenomenon which is radically outside\nof (or external to) the world it seeks to know; knowing is\nnot a purely rational attempt to escape illusion in order to\ndiscover what is ultimately \u201creal\u201d or \u201ctrue\u201d.\nRather, human knowing is among the ways organisms with\nevolved capacities for thought and language cope with problems. Minds,\nthen, are not passively observing the world; rather, they are actively\nadapting, experimenting, and innovating; ideas and theories are not\nrational fulcrums to get us beyond culture, but rather function\nexperimentally within culture and are evaluated on situated, pragmatic\nbases. Knowing is not the mortal\u2019s exercise of a \u201cdivine\nspark\u201d, either; for while knowing (or inquiry, to use\nDewey\u2019s term) includes calculative or rational elements, it is\nultimately informed by the body and emotions of the animal using it to\ncope.\n\nIn addition to academic life, Dewey comfortably wore the mantle of\npublic intellectual, infusing public issues with lessons found through\nphilosophy. He spoke on topics of broad moral significance, such as\nhuman freedom, economic alienation, race relations, women\u2019s\nsuffrage, war and peace, human freedom, and educational goals and\nmethods. Typically, discoveries made via public inquiries were\nintegrated back into his academic theories, and aided their revision.\nThis practice-theory-practice rhythm powered every area of\nDewey\u2019s intellectual enterprise, and perhaps explains why his\nphilosophical theories are still discussed, criticized, adapted, and\ndeployed in many academic and practical arenas. Use of Dewey\u2019s\nideas continues apace in aesthetics and art criticism, education,\nenvironmental policy, information theory, journalism, medicine,\npolitical theory, psychiatry, public administration, sociology, and of\ncourse in the philosophical areas to which Dewey contributed.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nJohn Dewey lead an active and multifarious life. He is the subject of\nnumerous biographies and an enormous literature interpreting and\nevaluating his extraordinary body of work: forty books and\napproximately seven hundred articles in over one hundred and forty\njournals.\n\nDewey was born in Burlington, Vermont on October 20, 1859 to Archibald\nDewey, a merchant, and Lucina Rich Dewey. Dewey was the third of four\nsons; the first, Dewey\u2019s namesake, died in infancy. He grew up\nin Burlington, was raised in the Congregationalist Church, and\nattended public schools. After studying Latin and Greek in high\nschool, Dewey entered the University of Vermont at fifteen and\ngraduated in 1879 at nineteen. After college, Dewey taught high school\nfor two years in Oil City, Pennsylvania. Subsequent time spent in\nVermont studying philosophy with former professor H.A.P. Torrey, along\nwith the encouragement of the editor of the Journal of Speculative\nPhilosophy, W.T. Harris, helped Dewey decide to attend graduate\nschool in philosophy at Johns Hopkins University in 1882. There, his\nstudy included logic with Charles S. Peirce (which Dewey found too\n\u201cmathematical\u201d, and did not pursue), the history of\nphilosophy (especially with George Sylvester Morris, and physiological\nand experimental psychology with Granville Stanley Hall (who trained\nwith Wilhelm Wundt in Leipzig and William James at\n Harvard).[1]\n\nThough many years later Dewey attributed important credit to\nPeirce\u2019s pragmatism for his mature views, during graduate\nschool, Peirce had no sizable impact. Dewey\u2019s main graduate\nschool influences\u2014Neo-Hegelian idealism, Darwinian biology, and\nWundtian experimental psychology\u2014created a tension, which he\nsought to resolve. Was the world fundamentally biological, functional,\nand material or was it, rather, inherently creative and spiritual? In\nno small part, Dewey\u2019s career was launched by his attempt to\nmediate and harmonize these views. While they shared the idea of\n\u201corganism\u201d, Dewey also saw in both \u2014- and\nrejected\u2014any aspects deemed overly abstract, atomizing, or\nreductionistic. His earliest attempts to create a \u201cnew\npsychology\u201d (aimed at merging experimental psychology with\nidealism) sought a method by which experience could be understood as\nintegrated and whole. As a result, Dewey\u2019s early approach was a\nmodified, English absolute idealism. Two years after matriculating,\nDewey completed graduate school in 1884 with a dissertation\ncriticizing Kant from an Idealist position (\u201cThe Psychology of\nKant\u201d); it remains lost.\n\nWhile scholars still debate the degree to which Dewey\u2019s mature\nphilosophy retained early Hegelian influences, it is clear that the\npersonal influence on Dewey was profound. New England\u2019s\nreligious culture, Dewey recalled, imparted an \u201cisolation of\nself from the world, of soul from body, [and] of nature from\nGod\u201d, and he reacted with \u201can inward laceration\u201d and\n\u201ca painful oppression\u201d. His study (with George Sylvester\nMorris) of British Idealist T.H. Green and G.W.F. Hegel afforded Dewey\npersonal and intellectual healing: \n\n\nHegel\u2019s synthesis of subject and object, matter and spirit, the\ndivine and the human, was, however, no mere intellectual formula; it\noperated as an immense release, a liberation. Hegel\u2019s treatment\nof human culture, of institutions and the arts, involved the same\ndissolution of hard-and-fast dividing walls, and had a special\nattraction for me. (FAE, LW5: 153) \n\n\nPhilosophically, Dewey\u2019s early encounters with Hegelianism\ninformed his career-long quest to integrate, as dynamic wholes, the\nvarious dimensions of experience (practical, imaginative, bodily,\npsychical) that philosophy and psychology had defined as discrete.\n\nDewey\u2019s family and reputation as a philosopher and psychologist\ngrew while at various universities, including the University of\nMichigan (1886\u201388, 1889\u20131894) and the University of\nMinnesota (1888\u201389). At Michigan, Dewey developed long-term\nprofessional relationships with James Hayden Tufts and George Herbert\nMead. In 1886, Dewey married Harriet Alice Chipman; they had six\nchildren and adopted one. Two of the boys died tragically young (two\nand eight). Chipman had a significant influence on Dewey\u2019s\nadvocacy for women and his shift away from religious orthodoxy. During\nthis period, Dewey wrote articles critical of British idealists from a\nHegelian perspective; he read and taught James\u2019 Principles\nof Psychology (1890), and called his own view \u201cexperimental\nidealism\u201d (1894a, The Study of Ethics, EW4: 264).\n\nIn 1894, at Tuft\u2019s urging, President William Rainey Harper\noffered Dewey the position of head of the Philosophy Department at the\nUniversity of Chicago, which at that time included both Psychology and\nPedagogy. Attracted by the prospect of putting these disciplines into\nactive collaboration, Dewey accepted the offer, and began to build the\ndepartment by hiring G.H. Mead from Michigan and J.R. Angell, a former\nstudent at Michigan (who also studied with James at Harvard). Dubbed,\nby James, the \u201cChicago School\u201d Dewey along with Tufts,\nAngell, Mead and several others develop \u201cpsychological\nfunctionalism\u201d. He also published the seminal \u201cReflex Arc\nConcept in Psychology\u201d (1896, EW5; hereafter RAC), and\nbroke from transcendental idealism and from his church.\n\nAt Chicago, Dewey founded The Laboratory School, which provided a site\nto test his psychological and educational theories. Dewey\u2019s wife\nAlice was the school\u2019s principal from 1896\u20131904. Dewey\nbecame active in Chicago\u2019s social and political causes,\nincluding Jane Addams\u2019 Hull House, and Addams became a close\npersonal friend of the Dewey\u2019s. Dewey and his daughter and\nbiographer Jane Dewey credited Addams with helping him develop his\nviews on democracy, education, and philosophy; nevertheless, the\nsignificance of Dewey\u2019s intellectual debt to Addams is still\nbeing uncovered (\u201cBiography of John Dewey\u201d, Dewey 1939a;\nsee also Seigfried 1999, Fischer 2013).\n\nIn 1904, conflicts related to the Laboratory School lead Dewey to\nresign his Chicago positions and move to the philosophy department at\nColumbia University in New York City; there, he also established an\naffiliation with Columbia\u2019s Teacher\u2019s College. Among\nDewey\u2019s important influences at Columbia were F.J.E. Woodbridge,\nWendell T. Bush, W.P. Montague, Charles A. Beard (political theory)\nand Franz Boas (anthropology). Dewey remained at Columbia until\nretirement 1930, going on to produce eleven more books.\n\nIn addition to a raft of important academic publications, Dewey wrote\nfor many non-academic audiences, notably via the New\nRepublic; he was active in leading, supporting, or founding a\nnumber of important organizations including the American Civil\nLiberties Union, the American Association of University Professors,\nthe American Philosophical Association, the American Psychological\nAssociation, and the New School for Social Research. Dewey was spoke\nout in support of both progressive politics and social change during\nthe first part of the twentieth century. His renown as a philosopher\nand educator lead to numerous invitations; he inaugurated the Paul\nCarus Lectures (revised and published as Experience and\nNature, 1925), gave the 1928 Gifford Lectures (revised and\npublished as The Quest for Certainty, 1929), and gave the\n1933\u201334 Terry Lectures at Yale (published as A Common\nFaith, 1934a). He traveled for two years in Japan and China, and\nalso made notable trips to Turkey, Mexico, the Soviet Union, and South\nAfrica.\n\nIn 1946, almost two decades after Alice Chipman Dewey died (1927),\nDewey married Roberta Lowitz Grant. John Dewey died of pneumonia in\nhis home in New York City on June 1, 1952.\n\nShort Chronology of the Life and Work of John Dewey\n\nSource: H&A 1998, xiv\n\n1859 Oct. 20.

Dies in\nNew York City\n\n\n2. Psychology\n\nDewey\u2019s involvement with psychology began early, with the hope\nthat this emerging discipline would provide answers to\nphilosophy\u2019s deepest questions. His early approach was akin to\nHegelian Idealism, though, markedly, it did not incorporate\nHegel\u2019s dialectical logic but instead sought to incorporate new\nmethods in psychology (Alexander forthcoming). He wished to overcome\nlongstanding divisions (between subject and object, matter and spirit,\netc.) and show how human experiences \u2014physical, psychical,\npractical, and imaginative \u2014were all integrated in one, dynamic\nperson (FAE, LW5: 153). Dewey had large ambitions for\npsychology as the new science of self-consciousness, calling\nit the \u201ccompleted method of philosophy\u201d (\u201cPsychology\nas Philosophic Method\u201d, EW1: 157). Although nominally a\ntextbook, Psychology (1887 EW2) was an introduction to\npsychology\u2019s study of the self as ultimate reality.\n\nSoon, Dewey began developing his own psychological theories; extant\naccounts of behavior, he argued, were flawed because they were\npremised upon outdated and false philosophical assumptions. (He\neventually judged that larger questions about the meaning of human\nexistence reached deep into cultural practices and exceeded the\nresources of psychology; such questions required philosophical\ninvestigations of experience in the fields of art, politics, ethics,\nand religion, etc.) Dewey\u2019s psychological work reconstructed the\ncomponents of human conduct (instincts, perceptions, habits, acts,\nemotions, and conscious thought) and these proved integral to later,\nmature statements about experience. They also informed his lifelong\ncontention that mind, contrary to long tradition, is not\nfundamentally subjective and isolated, but social and interactive,\nmade through natural and cultural environments.\n2.1 Associationism, Introspectionism, and Physiological Psychology\n\nDewey entered the field of psychology while it was dominated by\nintrospectionism (arising from associationism, a.k.a.,\n\u201cmentalism\u201d) and the newer physiological psychology\n(imported from Germany). Earlier British empiricists, such as John\nLocke and David Hume, accounted for intelligent behavior with (1)\ninternally inspected (\u201cintrospected\u201d) entities, including\nperceptual experiences (e.g., \u201cimpressions\u201d), and (2)\nthoughts or ideas (e.g., \u201cimages\u201d). These accrue toward\nintelligence by way of an elaborate process of associative learning.\nDiscovery-by-introspection was indispensable for many empiricists, and\nfor many physiological and experimental psychologists (e.g., Wundt) as\nwell.\n\nDewey was deeply influenced by his graduate school study of\nphysiological psychology with G. Stanley Hall; classes included\ntheoretical, physiological, and experimental psychology; he conducted\nlaboratory experiments on attention. Unlike introspectionism,\nHall\u2019s methods incorporated strict experimental controls, and\nthis biology-based approach promised Dewey an organic and holistic\nmodel of experience capable of overcoming the subjectivist dualisms\nplaguing the older, associationist\n models.[2]\n However, Dewey still found physiological psychology retaining an\natomized and mechanistic view of experience based on \u201csense\ndata\u201d. From his Hegelian perspective, this psychology could\nnever account for the wider world of lived meanings, the\nsocio-cultural environment. In other words, \u201corganism\u201d\nentailed \u201cenvironment\u201d, and \u201cenvironment\u201d\nentailed \u201cculture\u201d. A rigorously empirical psychology\ncould not merely study \u201cthe\u201d mind, but had to forge\nconnections with other\n sciences.[3]\n2.2 The \u201cReflex Arc\u201d and Dewey\u2019s Reconstruction of Psychology\n\nThus, Dewey sought an account of psychological experience mindful both\nof experimental limits and culture\u2019s pervasive\ninfluences. William James\u2019s tour de force, The Principles of\nPsychology (1890), modeled how he might explain the conscious and\nintelligent self without appeals to a transcendental Absolute. As\nDewey recalled, Principles\u2019 emphatically biological\nconception of mind gave his thinking \u201ca new direction and\nquality\u201d and \u201cworked its way more and more into all my\nideas and acted as a ferment to transform old beliefs\u201d\n(FAE, LW5: 157). Rather than measuring psychic phenomena\nagainst preexisting abstractions, James showed how one might employ a\n\u201cradical empiricism\u201d that starts from the phases and\nelements of actual, lived experience. The goal would be to understand\nexperience\u2019s functional origins from a perspective that was,\ntypically, coherent and whole.\n\nOne expression of Dewey\u2019s early psychology (and Jamesean turn)\nwas his seminal critique of the reflex arc concept (1896), written at\nChicago. The \u201creflex arc\u201d model of behavior was an\nincreasingly influential way to explain human behavior empirically and\nexperimentally using stimulus-response (cause-effect) pairings; it\nsought to displace other, less observable and testable approaches that\nrelied upon \u201cpsychic entities\u201d or \u201cmental\nsubstance\u201d. In the reflex arc model, a passive organism\nencounters an external stimulus causing a sensory and motor response;\nfor example, a child sees a candle (stimulus), grasps it (response),\nburns her hand (stimulus), and pulls her hand back (response). This,\nit argued, makes explicit the event\u2019s basic stimuli and\nresponses, replete with connections satisfactorily describable in\nmechanistic and physiological terms\u2014and all without recourse to\nmysterious and unobservable entities.\n\nDewey criticized the reflex arc framework on several grounds. First,\nevents (sensory stimulus, central response, and act) are artificially\nseparated for the purpose of analysis. \u201cThe reflex arc\u201d,\nDewey wrote, \u201cis not a comprehensive, or organic unity, but a\npatchwork of disjointed parts, a mechanical conjunction of unallied\nprocesses\u201d (RAC, EW5: 97). Second, the model falsifies\nthe nature of genuine interaction; organisms do not passively\nreceive stimuli and then actively respond; rather, organisms\ncontinuously interact with environments in cumulative and\nmodifying ways. The child who encounters a candle is already\nactively exploring, anticipating a room, for example; noticing the\nflame modifies already ongoing actions. \u201cThe real\nbeginning is with the act of seeing; it is looking, and not a\nsensation of light\u201d (RAC, EW5: 97). Third, and\nrelatedly, the model is too rigid in designating certain events as\nthe stimulus or the response\u2014in a word, it\n\u201creifies\u201d them. Because events studied are enmeshed in a\nwider, ongoing activity matrix, other designations (of\n\u201ccause\u201d or \u201cevent\u201d) could be plausible,\ncontingent on the aims of some other experimental inquiry.\nEffectively, Dewey pointed out how the reflex arc model, intending to\nshed metaphysical assumptions, had inadvertently imported new and\ndifferent ones. We are seeking to discover, Dewey wrote, \u201cwhat\nstimulus or sensation, what movement and response mean\u201d\nand we are finding that \u201cthey mean distinctions of flexible\nfunction only, not of fixed existence\u201d\n(RAC, EW5: 102; emphasis mine). This suggestion is pragmatic;\nit says, rather than seeking an underlying reality\n(pure stimulus, pure response), look to meanings. In\ndoing so, it is evident that terms such as stimulus, response,\nsensation, and movement \u201cmean distinctions of flexible function\nonly, not of fixed existence\u201d (RAC, EW5: 102). The\nmeaning of terms is grasped by recognizing their functions as acts in\na wider, dynamic context which includes aims and\n interests.[4]\n\n\nDewey\u2019s critique and reconstruction of the reflex arc presaged\nother important developments in his pragmatism. His argument that\npsychology needed to pay greater attention to context and function was\napplied, in time, to all the sciences, as well as to logic and\nmathematics. The methodological lesson was, in effect, a warning not\nto mistake eventual outcomes of analysis for existents already\n there.[5]\n Theoretical distinctions which are meaningful in specific situations\ndepend upon a wider context that is both retrospective and\nprospective.\n\nWhile there is not space to present Dewey\u2019s extensive\nreconstruction of the phenomena psychology considered permanent parts\nof human beings, a cursory review can show his philosophical method at\nwork. Let us consider instincts/impulses, perceptions, sensations,\nhabits, emotions, sentiency, consciousness, and mind.\n2.3 Instincts/Impulses\n\nAttempts to explain complex, developed behavior by reference to\npreexisting impulses and instincts had already been attacked by James\n(e.g., in \u201cHabit\u201d, James 1890: chapter 4) and Dewey\ncontinued the assault. Such explanations fail to consider\ninstinct\u2019s plastic and pliable character. Across a variety of\nindividuals, instincts considered simple or basic are anything\nbut\u2014they blossom into many different habits and\n customs.[6]\n They also fail to see that instincts are not pushing an essentially\npassive creature, but are actively taken up in diverse circumstances,\nfor diverse purposes. As with \u201cstimulus\u201d, the meaning of\nany \u201cinstinct\u201d depends on contextual factors, which can\ninclude both biological and socio-linguistic responses. But, in a\nphrase, there is no psychology without social psychology, no possible\ninquiry into pure, biological instincts (or any other\n\u201cnatural\u201d powers) which does not also consider both the\nsocial and environmental context of the phenomena studied and\nthe inquiry\u2019s own context. Instincts/impulses are interactive\nphenomena-in-environment, and must be appreciated as transactions\n(HNC, MW14: 66).\n2.4 Perception/Sensation\n\nDewey\u2019s methodological lesson regarding instincts was twofold;\nfirst, one cannot premise an empirical science on unquestioned,\nmetaphysical posits; even basic terms must be open to revision or\ndeletion; second, strictly analytical methods using simple elements to\nbuild up complex behavior are often inadequate to explain the meaning\nof psychological phenomena. This lesson also applies to perception and\nsensation. Dewey attacked the view, common in his day, that a\nperception (1) was simply and externally caused, (2) completely\noccupied a mental state, and (3) was passively received into an empty\nmental space.\n\nAll three elements, he argued, grow out of \u201cpsychophysical\ndualism\u201d, the erroneous and radical separation of perceiver and\nworld. Consider (1), external causation. Perception as simply and\nexternally caused is contravened by the Darwinian, ecological model\nwhere ongoing interactions between organism and environment include,\nbut are not ontologically reducible to, \u201cminds\u201d,\n\u201cbodies\u201d, and their impingements\u2014the so-called\n\u201cimpressions\u201d and \u201cideas\u201d of modern\nphilosophy. While there are events which are unbidden,\nsurprising, or not under our control, this does not justify the\nmetaphysical conclusion of a world \u201cout there\u201d and a mind\n\u201cin here\u201d. While experience is profoundly qualitative,\nqualities are never merely received (like packages in the mail) nor\nare they simple or context-free. This is, in effect, a new view of\nqualities that also rejects a longstanding dualism between\n\u201cobjective\u201d and \u201csubjective\u201d. A lemon\u2019s\n\u201cyellowness\u201d or \u201ctartness\u201d are neither\nin a perceiver nor in a lemon; either quality\nemerges from complex interactions and later become characterized\n(as \u201ctartness\u201d) for reasons germane to the\ninquiry making that designation. Dewey wrote, \n\n\nThe qualities never were \u2018in\u2019 the organism; they always\nwere qualities of interactions in which both extra-organic things and\norganisms partake. (EN, LW1: 198\u2013199) \n\n\nThus, perceptions and qualities are discriminations made in inquiry\nand language; they are not reports of ontological entities which are\nsimple, ultimate, or discrete. Always, pragmatic factors are decisive.\n(Dewey makes the same point about nouns and concepts; cf. W.V.O.\nQuine\u2019s example of \u201cgavagai\u201d.)\n\u201cPerception\u201d, then, is shorthand for the more complicated\nprocesses of interacting events. \u201cRed\u201d is an abstraction\nfrom more complex experiences (such as red-car-merging-into-my-lane),\nand the pragmatic question becomes, What is the function of this\nabstraction? How does it mediate thought or action for future\nexperiences? (\u201cA Naturalistic Theory of Sense-Perception\u201d,\nLW2: 51; EN, LW1: 198\u2013199)\n\nRegarding (2), perceptions pervading mental states, Dewey echoes an\nimportant point made by James in \u201cThe Stream of Thought\u201d\n(James 1890: chapter 9). Namely, while a perception may occupy the\nfocus of awareness, each has an attendant \u201cfringe\u201d which\ncontributes a contrast and, to the wider situation, an\n\u201cunderlying qualitative character\u201d (\u201cQualitative\nThought\u201d, LW5: 238 fn. 1). In the lemon case, above, the\n\u201ctartness\u201d has its character amidst a slew of\n\u201cfringe\u201d conditions such as immediate past flavors,\nanticipations, etc.\n\nFinally, regarding (3), as mentioned, perception is an activity of\n\u201ctaking up\u201d by organisms already functioning in\nsituations, not an instant, passive apprehension of stimulus. As such,\nthere are always selective adjustments; quick or slow, they always\ntake some time. Perception is never na\u00efve, never a\nconfrontation with some \u201cgiven\u201d content already imbued\nwith inherent meaning. Long before Wilfred Sellars (see\n entry on Sellars)\n dismissed the passive-perception-encounter as modern\nempiricism\u2019s \u201cMyth of the Given\u201d, Dewey rebuked such\nclaims. All seeing is seeing as\u2014adjustments within\nlarger acts. Over time, these habits of adjustment change and, as a\nresult, what is perceived can also shift; subsequent selections and\ninterpretations are modified (DE, MW9: 346).\n2.5 Acts and Habits\n\nLater writings develop the argument of \u201cReflex Arc\u201d,\nnamely that complex behavior cannot be explained by building up\nsimpler constituents. \u201cActs\u201d provide a better starting\npoint, of organisms in environments (HNC, MW14: 105). Acts\nare transactional: we act with and on things, in\ncontexts, amidst conditions. Acts are fundamental to understanding\nbehavior because they are selective. By directing movement\nand organizing situations, they manifest interest. This\ncombination\u2014of selectivity and interest\u2014make activities\nmeaningful. For example, our ancestors acted selectively regarding how\nto satisfy instinctive hunger; such selectivity created the conditions\nfor a more elaborate interest in the taste of food, and, much\nlater, in dining customs and cuisine.\n\nDrawing upon James\u2019 and Peirce\u2019s uses of\n\u201chabit\u201d, Dewey integrates habit deeply into his\nphilosophy. Habit helps explain various dimensions of human experience\n(biological, ethical, political, and aesthetic) as manifested in\ncomplex and social behaviors\u2014walking, talking, cooking,\n conversing.[7]\n Habits are not simple; they are composed of acts. Acts unfold in\ntime, beginning with instinct borne of need and muddling toward\nreintegration and satisfaction. To become a habit, an act-series must\npossess gradual and cumulative change; such change concresces as one\nact leads to the next. When there is a cumulative linking of acts\nwhich structure experience, there is \u201chabit\u201d. Habit, Dewey\nwrote, \u201cis an acquired predisposition to ways or modes\nof response, not to particular acts\u201d (HNC, MW14: 32).\nThese ways are typically shaped by both past experience as an\nindividual and especially through social and linguistic interactions;\nwe call habits shared by groups \u201ccustoms\u201d.\n\nWhile habits may become routines, Dewey argued against the assumption\nthat they were therefore automatic or insulated from conscious\nintervention. They cannot be automatic, because new situations vary,\nand the same exact acts never repeat. Thus, unlike machine routines,\norganic habits remain plastic, changeable. My habitual eating of\nsweets is subject to contingency (a sharp toothache) and modification\n(restraint, substitution); frequently, conscious reflection on an\nexisting habit is the first stage of habit revision.\n\nHabits were also envisioned as dormant powers, waiting to be invoked.\nDewey argued that habits are, instead, \u201cenergetic and dominating\nways of acting\u201d determining what we do and are: \u201cAll\nhabits are demands for certain kinds of activity; and they constitute\nthe self\u201d (HNC, MW14: 22, 21). Dewey inveighed against\nthe notion that habits are like individual possessions. Rather, habits\nexist as transactions between organisms and environments; they are not\n\u201cinner forces\u201d but functions which make adaptation or\nreconstruction possible. \n\n\nHabits enter into the constitution of the situation; they are\nin and of it, not, so far as it is concerned, something outside of it.\n(\u201cBrief Studies in Realism\u201d, MW6: 120) \n\n\nBecause the situation is cultural as well as bio-physical, habits are\nineliminably social. So-called \u201cindividual\u201d habits emerge\nwithin the social world of friends, family, home, work, media, etc.\nThis means that effecting a change of habits does not require a\nmagical act of sheer willpower, but rather intelligent inquiry into\nrelevant conditions (psychological, sociological, economic, etc.).\n2.6 Emotion\n\nLike \u201chabit\u201d, Dewey redescribed \u201cemotion\u201d as a\nbasic form of involvement present in \u201ccoordinated\ncircuits\u201d of activity. Where habits are controlled responses to\nproblematic situations, emotion, by contrast, is not predominantly\ncontrolled or organized; rather, it is an organism\u2019s resonance\nwith a situation, a \u201cperturbation from clash or failure of\nhabit\u201d (HNC, MW14: 54). As with the other aspects of\npsychological life, Dewey\u2019s account reconstructed emotion as\nfundamentally transactional with other experiences typically analyzed\nas discrete (the \u201crational\u201d or \u201cphysical\u201d\ndimensions, e.g.).\n\nDewey\u2019s account connected those of Charles Darwin and William\nJames. Darwin argued that internal emotional states cause organic\nexpressions which, depending on their survival value, may be subject\nto natural selection; for example, my feeling and expression of\nemotion may earn sympathy that aids survival of like-feeling\noffspring. James, in contrast, sought to decrease the distance between\nemotion and accompanying bodily expression. In actual cases of\nemotion, a perception excites a pre-organized physiological mechanism;\nour recognition of such changes just is the emotional\nexperience: \u201cwe feel sorry because we cry, angry\nbecause we strike\u201d (James 1890 [1981: 450]).\nDewey\u2019s \u201cThe Theory of Emotion\u201d (1894b & 1895,\nEW4) pressed James further, toward the integrated whole of\nfeeling-and-expression. Being sad is not merely feeling\nsad or acting sad but is the purposive organism\u2019s\noverall experience. This is Dewey\u2019s attempt to gently correct\nJames\u2019 unfortunate reiteration of mind-body dualism. To\nunderstand emotion, Dewey argued, we must see that \u201cthe mode of\nbehavior is the primary thing\u201d (\u201cThe Theory of\nEmotion\u201d, EW4: 174). As with habit, emotion is not the private\npossession of the subject, but rather emerges from the fluid boundary\nconnecting event and organism; emotion is \u201ccalled out by\nobjects, physical and personal\u201d, an intentional \u201cresponse\nto an objective situation\u201d (EN, LW1: 292). If I\nencounter a strange dog and I am perplexed as to how to react, there\nis an inhibition of habit, and this excites emotion. As I entertain a\nrange of incompatible responses (Run? Call out? Slink away?), a\ntension is created which further interrupts and inhibits habits, and\nis experienced as emotion (\u201cThe Theory of Emotion\u201d, EW4:\n182) Thus, emotions are intentional insofar as they are\n\u201cto or from or about something\nobjective, whether in fact or in idea\u201d and not merely reactions\n\u201cin the head\u201d (AE, LW10: 72).\n\nPhilosophically, emotion is a central feature of Dewey\u2019s\ncritique of traditional epistemology and metaphysics. He decried\ntraditional systems which, in their pursuit of rational access to\ntruth and reality, create an invidious distinction by casting emotion\nas confused thought, distraction, or bodily interference which needs\nto be suppressed, controlled, or bracketed. Emotion is intertwined,\npsychologically, both in the individual (in reasoning and acting), and\nin the wider culture (with social forms of meaning creation). Attempts\nto balkanize emotion are motivated in part, he argued, by the desire\nto segregate leisure from labor, men from women; on this reading, the\ntraditional rationalistic bent is, in effect, a power-play that\ndeserves intellectual and moral critique.\n2.7 Sentiency, Mind, and Consciousness\n\nDewey\u2019s accounts of sentiency, mind, and consciousness build\nupon those of impulse, perception, act, habit, and emotion. These are\ncomplex topics, but a cursory view can complete this sketch of\nDewey\u2019s psychology.\nSentiency\n\nAs with other psychic phenomena, sentience emerges through the\ntransactions of organisms in natural environments. In general,\ncreatures seek to satisfy needs and escape peril; when stability\nyields to precariousness, a struggle to reestablish balance begins;\nthere is adjustment to self, to one\u2019s environment, or both.\nMethods successful in the past, pre-organized responses, sometimes\nfail. In such cases, we become ambivalent\u2014divided against\nourselves about what to do next. It proves advantageous to\ninhibit practiced responses (to look before leaping); this\npause or inhibition of the action flow creates a space which, Dewey\nwrote, \u201cintroduces mental confusion, but also, in need for\nredirection, opportunity for observation, recollection,\nanticipation\u201d (EN, LW1: 237). In other words,\ninhibition creates ambivalence, and ambivalence makes possible new\nways of considering alternatives; crude, physical situations take on\nqualitatively new complexities of meaning. Thus, Dewey wrote,\nsentiency or feeling \n\n\nis in general a name for the newly actualized quality acquired by\nevents previously occurring upon a physical level, when these events\ncome into more extensive and delicate relationships of interaction.\n(EN, LW1: 204) \n\n\nAt this stage, the new relationships are not yet known; they\ndo, however, provide the conditions for knowing. Symbolization,\nlanguage, is the next step in liberating these noticed relationships\nusing intellectual tools including abstraction, memory, and\nimagination (EN, LW1: 199).\nMind\n\nDewey rejected both traditional accounts of mind-as-substance (or\ncontainer) and more contemporary schemes reducing mind to brain states\n(EN, LW1: 224\u2013225). Rather, mind is activity, a range\nof dynamic processes of interaction between organism and world.\nConsider the range connoted by mind: as memory (I am\nreminded of X); attention (I keep her in\nmind, I mind my manners); purpose (I have\nan aim in mind); care or solicitude (I\nmind the child); paying heed (I mind the\ntraffic stop). \u201cMind\u201d, then, ranges over many activities:\nintellectual, affectional, volitional, or purposeful. It is \n\n\nprimarily a verb\u2026[that] denotes every mode and variety of\ninterest in, and concern for, things: practical, intellectual, and\nemotional. It never denotes anything self-contained, isolated from the\nworld of persons and things, but is always used with respect to\nsituations, events, objects, persons and groups. (AE, LW10:\n267\u201368) \n\n\nAs Wittgenstein\n (entry on Wittgenstein, section on rule-following and private language)\n pointed out 30 years later, no private language (see\n entry on private language)\n is possible given this account of meaning. While meanings might be\nprivately entertained, they are not privately invented; meanings are\nsocial and emerge from symbol systems arising through collective\ncommunication and action (EN, LW1: 147).\n\nActive, complex animals are sentient due to the variety of distinctive\nconnections they have with their environment. But\n\u201cmentality\u201d (mindfulness) arises due to the eventual\nability to recognize and use meaningful signs. With language,\ncreatures can identify and differentiate feelings as\nfeelings, objects as objects, etc. \n\n\nWithout language, the qualities of organic action that are feelings\nare pains, pleasures, odors, colors, noises, tones, only potentially\nand proleptically. With language they are discriminated and\nidentified. They are then \u201cobjectified\u201d; they are\nimmediate traits of things. (EN, LW1: 198) \n\n\nThe bull\u2019s charge is stimulated by the red flag, but unlike the\ndriver ignoring a broken red stoplight, the bull cannot detach\n\u201cred\u201d as a sign; it remains a crude stimulus.\n\nDewey thus demoted and promoted the mind\u2019s significance. No\nlonger our spark of divinity, as some ancients held, it is also\nrescued from merely being a ghost in a machine. Mind becomes\nvital, investigating and addressing problems, and inventing\nnew tools, aims, and ideals. Mind bridges past and future, an\n\u201cagency of novel reconstruction of a pre-existing order\u201d\n(EN, LW1: 168).\nConsciousness\n\nLike mind, consciousness is also a verb\u2014the brisk transitioning\nof felt, qualitative events. Dewey was profoundly influenced by\nJames\u2019s metaphor of consciousness as a constantly moving\n\u201cstream of thought\u201d (FAE, LW5: 157). In the end,\nhowever, Dewey did not believe a fully adequate account of\nconsciousness could be captured in words. Talk about consciousness is\nelliptical\u2014it is \u201cvivid\u201d or\n\u201cconspicuous\u201d or \u201cdull\u201d\u2014and such\ncharacterizations are never quite adequate. Because the experience of\nconsciousness is ever-evanescent, we cannot fix it as we do for the\nobjects of our attention\u2014as, for example, \u201cpowers\u201d,\n\u201cthings\u201d, or \u201ccauses\u201d. Dewey, then, did not\ndefine consciousness, but evoked it using contrasts and instances.\nConsider these contrasts in Experience and Nature,\n(EN, LW1: 230)\n\n\nMind is\nConsciousness is  \n\nA whole system of meanings as embodied in organic life\nAwareness or perception of meanings (of actual events\nin their meaning)  \n\nContextual and persistent: a constant background \nFocal and transitive  \n\nStructural and substantial: a constant foreground \nA punctuated series of heres and nows  \n\nEnduring luminosity \nIntermittent flashes of varying intensities  \n\nA continuous transmission of messages \nThe occasional interception and singling out of a message that\nmakes it audible  \n\n\nGiven the processual, active nature of our psychology, Dewey was\nforced to depict consciousness with a dynamic, organismic vocabulary.\nConsciousness is thinking-in-motion, an ever-reconfiguring event\nseries that is qualitatively felt as experience transforms. Whereas\nmind is a \u201cstock\u201d of meanings, consciousness is\nrealization-and-reconstruction of meanings, enabling activities to be\nreorganized and redirected (EN, LW1: 233).\nConsciousness is drama; mind is the indispensable\nback story. This back story is not radically subjective; it is social,\nconstituted by communities past and present.\n\nDewey also tried to get at consciousness performatively, so to speak;\nhe provoked the reader to consider the nature of consciousness while\nreading. Here, again, he utilized notions of \u201cfocus\u201d and\n\u201cfringe\u201d, emphasizing how the latter is indispensable for\nmental orientation (EN, LW1: 231). As physical balance\ncontrols walking, mind\u2019s meanings constantly adjust and direct\npresent, focal interpretation. The progressive advance of vivid\nconsciousness is enabled by mind\u2019s pervasive and persistent\nsystem of meanings.\n\nHaving concluded this review of Dewey\u2019s psychology, we turn now\nto his account of experience.\n3. Experience and Metaphysics\n3.1 The Development of \u201cExperience\u201d\n\nDewey\u2019s notion of \u201cexperience\u201d evolved over the\ncourse of his career. Initially, it contributed to his idealism and\npsychology. After he developed instrumentalism in Chicago during the\n1890\u2019s, Dewey moved to Columbia, revising and expanding the\nconcept in 1905 with a historically significant essay, \u201cThe\nPostulate of Immediate Empiricism\u201d (PIE, MW3). Further\ndevelopments show up in \u201cThe Subject-matter of Metaphysical\nInquiry\u201d (1915, MW8) and the \u201cIntroduction\u201d to\nEssays in Experimental Logic (1916, MW10) which consolidated\nand advanced his view that \u201cexperience\u201d was more than just\nway to rebut subjectivism in psychology, but was also factored into\nmetaphysical accounts of existence and nature (Dykhuizen 1973:\n175\u201376). Dewey\nadvanced this in the1923 Carus Lectures, revised and expanded in his\nmetaphysical magnum opus, Experience and Nature (1925,\nrevised edition, 1929; EN, LW1). Many other significant\nelaborations on experience follow, notably in Art as\nExperience (1934b, AE,\n LW10).[8]\n Because experience is pivotal across his philosophical oeuvre,\ninterested readers should track its functions in other sections of\nthis entry; here, experience is treated concisely, with a focus upon\nDewey\u2019s philosophical method and metaphysics.\n\nTo begin, why was experience such an important concept that it\npenetrated Dewey\u2019s very approach to philosophy? Keep three\ninfluences in mind. First, recall that Dewey inherited from Darwin the\nidea of nature as a complex congeries of changing, transactional\nprocesses without fixed ends; in this context, experience means the\nundergoing and doing of organisms-in-environments, \u201ca matter of\nfunctions and habits, of active adjustments and readjustments, of\ncoordinations and activities, rather than of states of\nconsciousness\u201d (\u201cA Short Catechism Concerning\nTruth\u201d, MW6: 5).  Second, recall that Dewey took from James a\nradically empirical approach to philosophy\u2014the insistence that\nperspectival experience, including that called personal,\nemotional, or temperamental, was philosophically\nrelevant and worth factoring into abstract and logical theories.\nFinally, recall that Dewey accepted from Hegel experience as\nmanifested in particular social, historical, and cultural modes. Not\nonly is the self constituted through experiential transactions with\nthe community, but this recognition vitiates the Cartesian model of\nthe simple, atomic self and methods based upon that presumption.\nPhilosophy may start where we start, personally\n\u2014 with complex, symbolic, and cultural forms\u2014and then\narticulate further emergences from them.\n\nThese three major influences, plus Dewey\u2019s own discoveries,\nconvinced him that \u201cexperience\u201d was the linch-pin to a\nbroader theory of nature and humanity\u2019s axiological place within\nit. More than just another node in a system, experience also amounted\nto a metaphilosophical method, a way of doing philosophy.\nWithin this Weltanschauung, philosophy was not a rational\nbridge to transcend life, but was equipment for living. Thus,\nclarifying what experience meant assumed the greatest importance,\ninsofar as this was vital to philosophy earning back its status as a\nwisdom which might aid survival, growth, and flourishing.\n\nIt should be noted that \u201cexperience\u201d, both as sheer\nterminology and as Dewey deployed the concept, generated much\nconfusion and debate. Dewey recognized this and commented about it\ntoward the end of his\n life.[9]\n Decades later, one of the Dewey\u2019s foremost philosophical\ncelebrants, Richard Rorty, lambasted Dewey for both the term and (what\nRorty perceived as) Dewey\u2019s\n intentions.[10]\n (Rorty 1977, 1995, 2006)\nNevertheless, since the term lives on, both in Dewey\u2019s work and\nin everyday discourse, it deserves continued analysis.\n3.2 Traditional Views of Experience and Dewey\u2019s Critique\n\nUnderstanding Dewey\u2019s view of experience requires, first, some\nnotion of what he rejected. It was typical for many philosophers to\nconstrue experience narrowly, as the private contents of\nconsciousness. These contents might be perceptions (sensing), or\nreflections (calculating, associating, imagining) done by the\nsubjective mind. Some, such as Plato and Descartes, denigrated\nexperience as a flux which confused or diverted rational inquiry.\nOthers, such as Hume and Locke, thought that experience (as atomic\nsensations) provided the mind at least some resources for\nknowing, albeit with reduced ambitions. Both general philosophical\napproaches agreed that percepts and concepts were\ndifferent and in tension; they agreed that sensation was perspectival\nand context-relative; they also agreed that this relativity\nproblematized the assumed mission of philosophy\u2014to know\nwith certainty\u2014and differed only about the degree of the\nproblem.\n\nDewey disputed the shared empiricist conviction that sensations are\ncategorically separable contents of consciousness. This belief, he\nargued, produced a \u201cwhole epistemological industry\u201d\ndevoted to solving the general problem of \u201ccorrespondence\u201d\nand a host of specific puzzles (about the existence of an external\nworld, other minds, free will, etc.) (\u201cPropositions, Warranted\nAssertibility, and Truth\u201d, LW14: 179). This\n\u201cindustry\u201d isolates philosophy from empirically informed\naccounts of experience and from pressing, practical problems.\nRegarding the phenomenon of mental privacy, Dewey argued that while we\nhave episodes of what might be called mental interiority, it is a later\nhuman development. \u201cPersonality, selfhood, subjectivity, are\neventual functions that emerge with complexly organized interactions,\norganic and social\u201d (EN, LW1: 162; see also\n178\u201379). Regarding sensorial atomicity, discussed previously in\nthe section on psychology, Dewey explained sensation as embedded in a\nlarger sensori-motor circuit, a transaction which should not be\nquarantined to any single phase\u2014nor to consciousness. Sensation\nemerges dynamically from the engagements of minds, bodies, and their\nenvironments, where \u201cenvironments\u201d includes human language\nand culture. (Consider, as evidence of how blurry the boundaries\nbetween \u201csensation\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d can be, how\ndifferently food tastes in varying circumstances and cultures.)\n\nDewey levied similar criticisms against traditional accounts of\nreflective thought. Mind is neither static nor a substance which\nstands, somehow, apart from the body\u2014or from history, from\nculture. Reasoning is one function of mind, not the product of a\nseparate \u201cfaculty\u201d, and not \u201cpurified\u201d of\nfeeling. Rather, reasoning is always permeated with both feelings and\npractical exigencies. While it can help to \u201cbracket out\u201d a\nfeeling or exigency scrambling a present calculation, it is\nnevertheless true that reasoning subsists in a wider\n\u201cqualitative world\u201d, one that \u201cforms the field of\ncharacteristic modes of thinking, characteristic in that thought is\ndefinitely regulated by qualitative considerations\u201d\n(\u201cPsychology and Work\u201d, LW5: 243).\n3.3 Dewey\u2019s Positive Account of Experience\n\nSo far, these details, and the section on psychology, limn an outline\nof Dewey\u2019s view: experience is processual, transactional,\nsocially mediated, and not categorically prefigured as\n\u201crational\u201d or \u201cemotional\u201d. Here are three\nadditional, positive characterizations: first, experience as\nexperimental; second, experience as primary\n(\u201chad\u201d) vs. secondary (\u201cknown\u201d); and\nthird, experience as methodological for philosophy.\n\nFirst, experience exhibits a fundamentally experimental character.\nThis was impressed upon Dewey in a variety of his educational roles.\nChildren\u2019s experiences involve alternating phases: acting and\nbeing acted upon. Such phases become \u201cexperimental\u201d when\nagents consciously relate what is tried with what eventuates and\neventually understand which actions are significant for controlling\nfuture events. \u201cLearning\u201d is the name for the outcome of\nexperience as\n experimental.[11]\n\nSecond, as shown, Dewey did not think experience was primarily known\nor reflective; much is \u201cfelt\u201d or \u201chad\u201d. Dewey\ncalls such experience direct, primary, or had. Had experience\nis barely regulated or reflected upon, whereas other experience is\ncharacterized by \u201cknowing\u201d or mediation-by-reflection;\nDewey labels such experiences \u201cindirect\u201d,\n\u201csecondary\u201d, or \u201cknown\u201d. Known\nexperience abstracts away from had (or direct) experience in\npurposeful and selective ways; knowing isolates certain relations or\nconnections. Dewey\u2019s The Quest for Certainty provides a\ncogent description:\n\n\n[E]xperienced situations come about in two ways and are of two\ndistinct types. Some take place with only a minimum of regulation,\nwith little foresight, preparation and intent. Others occur because,\nin part, of the prior occurrence of intelligent action. Both kinds are\nhad; they are undergone, enjoyed or suffered. The first are\nnot known; they are not understood; they are dispensations of fortune\nor providence. The second have, as they are experienced, meanings that\npresent the funded outcome of operations that substitute definite\ncontinuity for experienced discontinuity and for the fragmentary\nquality due to isolation. (QC, LW4:\n 194)[12]\n\n\nDewey\u2019s had/known distinction is a way of describing existence\nwithout presupposing a dualism between appearance/reality. Much in\nexperience is unknown to us without being illusory or merely apparent;\nwe are not trapped in a cave full of illusions with only rational\ndialectic to yank us upwards. Rather, we engage and cope with a world\nwhich is not completely meaningful. We strive to make the world more\nmeaningful, but while some of the meanings devised assist in\nprediction and control of circumstances, others are simply\nenjoyed\u2014but that does not make them less real.\n\nThird, experience was also considered a \u201cmethod\u201d. This\nrequires some unpacking.\n\nDewey\u2019s distinction between experience \u201chad\u201d and\n\u201cknown\u201d was more than just a phenomenological observation;\nit was a metaphilosophical directive regarding how philosophy, itself,\nshould be done. For experience is not just \u201cstuff\u201d\npresented to or witnessed by consciousness; rather, experience is\nactivity, engagement with life. Philosophy, too, is a form of\nactivity\u2014which means that we need to do philosophy\ndifferently; we need pay attention to where and how we start; in this\nsense, experience is a\n method.[13]\n\nOne might sensibly ask, \n\n\nIf Dewey says that experience happens in both\nprimary (felt, had) and secondary (reflective, known) ways, why not\nstart with theory? Is that not experience, too? \n\n\nDewey\u2019s reply would be that while theory is one kind of\nexperiencing, it is not where we start; theory is an intermediate\nphase of inquiry. As we live our lives, we confront problems which\ninvoke the need for inquiry and, often, there is a need to devise a\ntool of explanation and amelioration. Theory is that tool, generated\nby these encounters; it does not come first. \u201cThe vine of\npendant theory\u201d, Dewey wrote, \u201cis attached at both ends to\nthe pillars of observed subject-matter\u201d (EN, LW1: 11;\nsee also 386).\n\nAs did James and Peirce before him, Dewey challenged not only the\ntheories of previous philosophers, but the assumptions informing their\nmethods. For generations, philosophers started their\nphilosophical examinations with various theoretical\nconceptions\u2014\u201csubstances\u201d, \u201cmind vs.\nbody\u201d, \u201cpleasure as natural aim\u201d, and so on. In his\nphilosophical work, Dewey criticized any number of these\npresuppositions, but here his point is metaphilosophical\u2014how\nthese conceptions enter into the practice of philosophy as\npresuppositions. Too often philosophy puts the (theoretical) cart\nbefore the (practical) horse. We simply cannot know\u2014and should\nnot assume\u2014which terms and theories are necessary for\nan analysis of a novel situation. Nevertheless, much philosophy has\nassumed such necessities. We may call this the assumption of a\n\u201ctheoretical starting point\u201d. It has produced endless\ndialectical exchanges; it has caricatured and hollowed out many\ncomplex and changeable subject matters. Overall, it has isolated\nphilosophy from a more thoroughgoing empiricism which could engage\nwith humanity\u2019s most important problems.\n\nDewey\u2019s suggestion of \u201cexperience as method\u201d method,\nthen, is both a warning and a positive recommendation. It warns\nphilosophers to recognize that while intellectual terms may\nseem \u201coriginal, primitive and simple\u201d they should\nbe understood as the historically and normatively situated\n\u201cproducts of discrimination and classification\u201d\n(EN, LW1: 386; see also 371\u2013372, 375).\n\u201cKnowing\u201d is not an activity standing somehow beyond\nexperience or nature; it is an activity with its own standpoint and\nqualitative character. Intellectual products come, then, from earlier\ninquiries, which possessed their own parameters and purposes.\nWhatever theory is eventually devised for a new\nsituation\u2014and Dewey is not against theory, to be very\nclear\u2014it must be checked against ordinary experience\n(EN, LW1: 26).\n\nDewey\u2019s proposed method\u2014the experiential starting\npoint\u2014is not just another philosophical \u201cmove\u201d, but\na radical attempt to philosophize from what Ortega y Gasset calls\n\u201cthe shaken confines of our own life\u201d and what Douglas\nBrowning calls \u201cbedrock\u201d (Ortega y Gasset 1957: 40;\nBrowning 1998:\n 74).[14]\n Dewey wrote,\n\n\nThe experiential or denotative method tells us that we must go behind\nthe refinements and elaborations of reflective experience to the gross\nand compulsory things of our doings, enjoyments and\nsufferings\u2014to the things that force us to labor, that satisfy\nneeds, that surprise us with beauty, that compel obedience under\npenalty. (EN, LW1: 375\u201376)\n\n\nSuch a method is truly critical, because it forces inquirers\nto check previous interpretations and judgments against their live\nencounters in a new situation (EN, LW1: 364). This entails\nthat philosophy as a practice impose upon itself a much more\nradical and dynamic model of theorizing, one pressed into much closer\ntransactions with existing practices and problems. This imposition, in\nturn, forces philosophy to engage with new subject matters (and\ntheories), beyond the traditional \u201cproblems of\nphilosophy\u201d, and to embrace the idea that \u201cthe starting\npoint is the actually problematic\u201d (EN, LW1:\n61).\n3.4 Metaphysics\n\nMuch which is central to Dewey\u2019s metaphysics has been\ndiscussed\u2014the transactional organism-environment setting, mind,\nconsciousness, and experience. Accordingly, this section will focus on\nthe development of Dewey\u2019s conception of\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d, the main project in Experience and\nNature, how a so-called empirical metaphysics intended to\nreconnect with the ancient idea of philosophy as wisdom, and finally\nit will sketch some of the criticisms Dewey\u2019s metaphysics\nreceived.\n3.5 The Development of \u201cMetaphysics\u201d\n\nDebate over a definite meaning for the term \u201cmetaphysics\u201d,\nwas just as alive in Dewey\u2019s day as in ours. From the beginning,\nDewey sought to critique and reconstruct metaphysical concepts (e.g.,\nreality, self, consciousness, time, necessity, and individuality) and\nsystems (e.g., Spinoza, Leibniz, Kant, and Hegel). Like his fellow\npragmatists Peirce, James, and Mead, Dewey sought to transform not\neradicate metaphysics. As described earlier, Dewey\u2019s early\nmetaphysical views were closest to idealism, but engagements with\nexperimental science and instrumentalism convinced him to abandon\ntraditional metaphysics\u2019 project of giving an ultimate and\ncomplete account of reality \u00fcberhaupt.\n\nHis dormant interest in metaphysics was revivified at Columbia by his\ncolleague F. J. E. Woodbridge, who illustrated how metaphysics might\nbe done in a \u201cdescriptive\u201d rather than an extra-physical\nway (\u201cBiography of John Dewey\u201d, in Schilpp 1939: 36).\nWhile many of Dewey\u2019s most important writings on metaphysics\nwere also about experience (discussed above), special attention should\nbe paid to \u201cThe Postulate of Immediate Empiricism\u201d (1905,\nPIE, MW3), \u201cThe Subject-Matter of Metaphysical\nInquiry\u201d (1915, MW8), and his \u201cIntroduction\u201d to\nEssays in Experimental Logic (1916c, MW10)\u2014all vital\nsteps toward his magnum opus, Experience and\n Nature.[15]\nEN\u2019s final chapters, dealing with art and consummatory\nexperience, are developed in Art as Experience (1934b, LW10),\nanother source of significant metaphysical discussions.\n\nWhile labels tend to obscure Dewey\u2019s innovations, it is safe say\nthat Dewey had a realist, naturalistic, non-reductive, emergentist,\nprocess\n metaphysics.[16]\n He sought to describe the most general features (\u201cgeneric\ntraits\u201d) of nature in a way which did empirical justice to the\nworld as encountered, and which could be useful toward future attempts\nto describe and change the world for the better. Unlike other\nmetaphysics, Dewey explicitly said that metaphysics served something\nfurther\u2014criticism. In the end, Dewey wound up\ndescribing his efforts both as a \u201cmetaphysics\u201d and as a\n\u201csystem\u201d, that is, \u201cthe hanging together of various\nproblems and various hypotheses in a perspective\u201d (\u201cNature\nin Experience\u201d, LW14: 141\u2013142). He described his\nenterprise as both informed by \u201ca definite point of view\u201d\nand by the contemporary, human world (\u201cHalf-hearted\nNaturalism\u201d, LW3: 75\u201376 ).\n3.6 The Project of Experience and Nature\n\nExperience and Nature provides both extended criticism of\npast metaphysical approaches, especially their quest for certainty and\nassumption of an Appearance/Reality framework, and a positive, general\ntheory regarding how human existence is situated in nature. It is\nproffered as empirical, descriptive, and hypothetical; it eschews\nclaims of special access beyond \u201cexperience in unsophisticated\nforms\u201d, which, Dewey argued, give us \u201cevidence of a\ndifferent world and points to a different metaphysics\u201d\n(EN, LW1: 47). EN looks to existing characteristics\nof human culture, anthropologically, to see what they reveal, more\ngenerally, about nature. The isolation, analysis, and description of\nthe \u201cgeneric traits of existence\u201d and their relations to\none another, is one significant outcome.\n\nWhile this entry lacks space for even a bare summary, it is worth\nnoting that EN begins with an extensive discussion of method\nand experience as a new starting point for philosophy. An extensive\npresentation of the generic traits follows, which, in due course,\nevokes and informs discussions regarding science, technology, body,\nmind, language, art, and value. While the traits are not presented\nsystematically (\u00e0 la other metaphysicians such as Spinoza or\nWhitehead) there is a progression moving from the more basic to the\nmore\n complex.[17]\n3.7 Empirical Metaphysics and Wisdom\n\nSince Dewey is a pragmatist and meliorist, it is worth asking: How can\nmetaphysics contribute to the world beyond academic philosophy?\nDewey\u2019s larger ambition was to return philosophy to an older,\nancient mission\u2014the pursuit of wisdom. And while Dewey describes\nphilosophy as inherently critical, a \u201ccriticism of\ncriticisms\u201d, where does that leave even an empirical,\nhypothetical, naturalistic metaphysics? (EN, LW1: 298) Dewey\nraises the issue, prophylactically: \n\n\nAs a statement of the generic traits manifested by existences of all\nkinds without regard to their differentiation into physical and\nmental, [metaphysics] seems to have nothing to do with criticism and\nchoice, with an effective love of wisdom. (EN, LW1: 308)\n\n\nDewey answers his own question with his account of the generic traits,\none which purportedly provides \u201ca ground-map of the province of\ncriticism, establishing base lines to be employed in more intricate\ntriangulations\u201d (EN, LW1:\n 308).[18]\n New maps, new ways of looking at existence can defang old\ntruisms\u2014e.g., men are rational, women are emotional, humans are\nintelligent, animals are dumb, etc.\u2014and facilitate the creation\nof new meanings. Many of philosophy\u2019s conceptual tools (kinds,\ncategories, dualisms, aims, and values) were entrenched; a\nreconsideration of the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d of\nexistents promised a basis for a new start.\n\nThe activity of metaphysical map-making fits in with the more engaged\nrole Dewey envisioned for philosophers. The philosopher would serve as\nwhat Dewey called a \u201cliaison officer\u201d, a kind of semantic\nintermediator able to help those speaking at cross purposes (or in\ndifferent jargons) to communicate more effectively (EN, LW1:\n306). Metaphysical maps draw from contemporary circumstances and\npurposes, so they would not promise certainty or permanency. Indeed,\nthe general traits \u201care actually so intimately intermixed that\nall important issues are concerned with their degrees and the ratios\nthey sustain to one another\u201d (EN, LW1: 309). Just as\nphysical maps must be redrawn based on changing needs and purposes, so\nwould metaphysical maps; in the meantime, hopefully, criticism is\nsharpened and value is more effectively secured.\n3.8 Criticisms of Dewey\u2019s Metaphysics\n\nDewey received and responded to many criticisms of his metaphysical\nviews, from 1905\u2019s \u201cPostulate of Immediate\nEmpiricism\u201d and on. Critics often overlooked that his position\nwas aiming to undercut prevailing metaphysical genres; often, his view\nwas just aligned with one or another existing position. (He was taken,\nvariously, as in league with realism, idealism, relativism,\nsubjectivism, etc. See Hildebrand 2003.) One recurrent criticism was\nthat the view advanced in PIE (that \u201cthings are what\nthey are experienced as\u201d) could not possibly yield a metaphysics\nbecause it merely bespoke the kind of subjective, immediate experience\ninimical to a more mediated and objective account. Similar reactions\narrived twenty years late to EN from critics attacking the\ncontrast there between \u201cexperience\u201d and\n \u201cnature\u201d.[19]\n\nSubsequent criticisms honed in on a supposed tension between two foci\nof Dewey\u2019s: \u201cqualities\u201d vs. \u201crelations\u201d.\nQualities are immediate, while relations are mediate; how could both\ncoexist in the same item of experience? There seemed to be a\ncontradiction within Dewey\u2019s\n view.[20]\n Richard Bernstein (1961) seized on this issue, and claimed that Dewey\nharbored two irreconcilable strains, a \u201cmetaphysical\nstrain\u201d and a \u201cphenomenological strain\u201d, but failed\nto sufficiently account for them with his \u201cprinciple of\ncontinuity\u201d. One response to this argued that such critiques are\nvitiated by their unwitting reproduction of the very spectatorial\nstandpoint Dewey\u2019s experiential starting point was designed to\n prevent.[21]\n\nIn recent years, some specialists in pragmatism and American\nphilosophy have debated whether Dewey should have engaged in\nmetaphysics at all. Some, such as Richard Rorty and Charlene Haddock\nSeigfried, have argued that Dewey\u2019s critique of traditional\nmetaphysics was the most he should have done; going further diverted\nhim from more important ethical work (Seigfried 2001a, 2004) or\nplunged him into foundationalist projects he had previously disavowed\n(\u201cDewey\u2019s Metaphysics\u201d in Rorty 1977). Others have\nargued that Dewey invented a genuinely new approach to metaphysics\nwhich avoided old problems while contributing something salutary to\nculture at large (Myers forthcoming, Garrison 2005, Boisvert 1998a,\nAlexander forthcoming).\n4. Inquiry and Knowledge\n4.1 The Organic Roots of Instrumentalism\n\nThe interactional, organic model Dewey developed in his psychology\ninformed his theories of learning and knowledge. Given this new\necological framework, a range of traditional epistemological proposals\nand puzzles (premised on metaphysical divisions such as\nappearance/reality, mind/world) lost credibility. \u201cSo far as the\nquestion of the relation of the self to known objects is\nconcerned\u201d, Dewey wrote, \u201cknowing is but one special case\nof the agent-patient, of the behaver-enjoyer-sufferer situation\u201d\n(\u201cBrief Studies in Realism\u201d, MW6: 120). As we have already\nseen in psychology, Dewey\u2019s wholesale repudiation of the\ntradition\u2019s basic metaphysical framework required extensive\nreconstructions in every other area; one popular name for\nDewey\u2019s reconstruction of epistemology (or \u201ctheory of\ninquiry\u201d, as Dewey preferred to call it) was\n \u201cinstrumentalism\u201d.[22]\n\nAs did his earlier psychological functionalism, instrumentalism\nutilized a Darwinian starting point to criticize and dissolve\nentrenched divisions between, for example, realism/idealism,\nscience/religion, and empiricism/rationalism. Seen from this\nstandpoint, change and transformation are natural features of the\nactual world, and knowledge and logic are ways to adapt, survive, and\nthrive. The vitality of the world in which we reason, its dynamic and\nbiological basis, is more informative about knowledge and truth than\nthe paradigms of physics or mathematics, historically celebrated by\nphilosophy. While instrumentalism acknowledges sensation\u2019s\ncontributions, it also insists upon the constructive power of\n reasoning.[23]\n\nEarly statements of instrumentalism (and definitive breaks by Dewey\nwith Hegelian logic) may be seen in \u201cSome Stages of Logical\nThought\u201d (Dewey 1900 [1916], MW1); that essay follows Peirce\n (entry on Peirce section on pragmatism, pragmaticism, and the scientific method],[24]\n especially the well known 1877\u201378 articles championing the\nlarger framework of scientific thinking, namely the\n\u201cdoubt-inquiry process\u201d (MW1: 173; see also Peirce 1877,\n1878). This account is developed in Studies in Logical Theory\n(Dewey 1903b, MW2), by Dewey and his collaborators at Chicago. In the\nwork, Dewey acknowledges a \u201cpreeminent obligation\u201d to\n James (Perry 1935: 308\u2013309).[25]\n\nStudies criticizes transcendentalist logic extensively,\nconcluding that logic should not assume either thought or\nreality\u2019s existence in general but should rest content\nwith the function or use of ideas in experience: \n\n\nThe test of validity of [an] idea is its functional or instrumental\nuse in effecting the transition from a relatively conflicting\nexperience to a relatively integrated one. (Studies, MW2:\n359) \n\n\nThus, instrumentalism abandons all psycho-physical dualisms and all\ncorrespondentist theories of knowing. Dewey wrote, \n\n\nIn the logical process the datum is not just external existence, and\nthe idea mere psychical existence. Both are modes of\nexistence\u2014one of given existence, the other of\npossible, of inferred existence\u2026.In other words, datum\nand ideatum are divisions of labor, cooperative instrumentalities, for\neconomical dealing with the problem of the maintenance of the\nintegrity of experience. (Studies, MW2: 339\u2013340)\n\n4.2 Beyond Empiricism, Rationalism, and Kant\n\nSo far, we have seen that Dewey\u2019s instrumentalism is of a piece\nwith his system\u2019s other components. But it was also responding\nto dialectic within philosophy\u2019s epistemological positions,\nparticularly the tension between British empiricism, rationalism (see\nentry on\n rationalism vs. empiricism),\n and the Kantian synthesis. A brief account will suffice to introduce\nDewey\u2019s response.\n\nClassical empiricists insisted that the origins of knowledge lay in\nsensory experience. They were motivated, in part, by the concern that\nrationalistic accounts, seeking to trace knowledge to thought alone\n(rather than particular, independent sense stimuli), were too\nunchecked. Without the limits imposed by sense experience, philosophy\nwould continue to produce wild and divergent dogmatisms. There was in\nclassical empiricism, as in Dewey, a genuine interest in scientific\nprogress; for science to advance, it needed to escape unfettered\nspeculation. The account developed, then, by figures such as Locke,\nBerkeley, and Hume claimed that (in Locke\u2019s version) the world\nwrites on a receptive blank slate, the mind, in the language of ideas.\nBy the faculties of memory, association, and imagination, knowledge is\ngenerated; further elaborations of what is known must, on the\nempiricists\u2019 account, be checkable against its origins in sense\nexperience.\n\nRationalists, in contrast, argued that knowledge was by nature both\nabstract and deductively certain. Consider, for a moment, your sensory\nexperiences: they are fluid, individualized, and permeated by the\nrelativity borne of innumerable external conditions. How could a\nphilosophical account of genuine knowledge\u2014necessarily\ncertain, self-evident, and unchanging\u2014be derived using a method\nso besotted with sensorial flux? Knowledge must derive, rather, from\ninner concepts, which could be certain. Knowledge, then, is produced\nby an immaterial entity, mind, with a power to reason which is innate,\nand which stands logically independent of practical ends and the\ncontingencies of one\u2019s physical body.\n\nKant responded to the empiricist-rationalist tension by reigning in\ntheir overweening ambitions; he argued that philosophy must stop\nattempting to transcend the limits of thought and experience.\nPhilosophy\u2019s proper aspiration is more modest\u2014to discover\nwhat is possible to know in the phenomenal world. Kant, then, refused\nan originary role to either percepts or concepts, arguing instead that\nsense and reason are co-constitutive of knowledge. More important,\nKant argued that what epistemology requires is an account of the mind\nas a systematic and constructive force.\n\nDewey\u2019s response to this three-way epistemological conflict was\nforeshadowed in the earlier discussion of the \u201cReflex Arc\u201d\npaper, with its account of natural constituent of the sensori-motor\ncircuit. Any proposal premised on a disconnected mind and\nbody\u2014or upon one assuming that stimuli (be they causes or\nimpressions or whatever) were atomic and in need of\nsynthesis\u2014was a non-starter for\n Dewey.[26]\n\nWhile he accepted some of Kant\u2019s criticisms of rationalism and\nempiricism, he rejected Kant\u2019s propagation of several\nsignificant but unjustified assumptions. Chief among these assumptions\nwas the idea that knowledge must be certain; that nature and intellect\nwere categorically distinct; and that a noumenal realm\n(things-in-themselves) was a justified posit. In addition, Dewey\nquestioned Kant\u2019s claim that the sensations which supply\nknowledge are inchoate, initially\u2014this claim being merely\nanother posit driven by Kant\u2019s architectonic. Methodologically,\nand perhaps more significantly, Dewey followed James in criticizing\nKant\u2019s overall standpoint as, still, too spectatorial. From the\npragmatic, Jamesean, \u201cradical empiricist\u201d standpoint, one\nmay accept as real (though not necessarily as known) a variety of\nphenomenon, whether such are clear, vague, felt, remembered,\nanticipated, etc.\n\nThus, for Dewey, Kant cannot achieve the philosophical perspective\nnecessary for a dynamic synthesis of perception and conception, nature\nand reason, practice and theory. While Kant\u2019s model of an active\nand structuring mind was a clear advance over more passive systems, it\nmaintained the retrograde depiction of knowledge as faithful mirror of\nreality. The missing insight was knowledge as dynamic\ninstrument, consisting in managing (predicting, controlling,\nguiding) future experience. Within this framework,\ndetermining \u201cknowledge\u201d is akin to judging the value of an\neye or hand; one asks how they affect the organism\u2019s ability to\ncope: \n\n\nWhat measures [knowledge\u2019s] value, its correctness and truth, is\nthe degree of its availability for conducting to a successful issue\nthe activities of living beings. (\u201cThe Bearings of Pragmatism\nUpon Education\u201d, in MW4: 180) \n\n\nThus, Dewey replaced Kant\u2019s mind-centered system with one\ncentered upon experience-nature transactions\u2014\u201ca\nreversal\u201d, Dewey wrote, \u201ccomparable to a Copernican\nrevolution\u201d (QC, LW4: 232).\n4.3 Inquiry, Knowledge, and Truth\n\nIn the context of instrumentalism, what do \u201clogic\u201d and\n\u201cepistemology\u201d amount to? Dewey remains focused on these\nsubject matters but insisted on a more empirical approach. How, he\nasked, does reasoning and learning actually\n happen?[27]\n Dewey addresses the nature of logic in his major 1938 study,\nLogic: The Theory of Inquiry (LTI, LW12); his term\nfor logic is the \u201cinquiry into inquiry\u201d. LTI\nundertakes the systematic process of collecting, organizing, and\nexplicating the actual conditions of different kinds of inquiry; the\naim of this reconstructed logic, as outlined in the 1917 \u201cThe Need for a Recovery of Philosophy\u201d, is pragmatic and ameliorative: to provide an\n\u201cimportant aid in proper guidance of further attempts at\nknowing\u201d (MW10: 23).\n\nThroughout his career, Dewey described processes and patterns evident\nin active problem solving. Here, we consider three: inquiry,\nknowledge, and truth. There is, Dewey argued, a \u201cpattern of\ninquiry\u201d which prevails in problem solving. In \u201cAnalysis\nof Reflective Thinking\u201d (1933, LW8) and LTI (LW12) it\nhas five phases. Explicitly disavowing categorical divisions between\nemotion and reason, the initial phase of inquiry begins (1) with a\nfeeling of something amiss, a unique and particular\ndoubtfulness; this feeling endures as a pervasive quality imbued in\ninquiry and serves as a kind of \u201cguide\u201d to subsequent\nphases. Next, because what is initially present is indeterminate, (2)\na problem must be specifically formulated; problems do not\npreexist inquiry, as typically\n assumed.[28]\n Next, (3) a hypothesis is constructed, one which\nimaginatively utilizes both theoretical ideas and perceptual facts to\nforecast the possible consequences of various operations. Next, in\nphase (4), one reasons through the meanings involved in the\nhypothesis, sizing up the implications or possible contradictions\ninvolved; frequently, what is discovered here requires a return to an\nearlier phase (to reformulate the hypothesis or even the\n problem).[29]\n Finally, inquiry comes to a close with phase (5), acting to evaluate\nand test the hypothesis; here, it is revealed whether a proposed\nsolution solves the problem, or to put it LTI\u2019s\nterminology, whether inquiry has converted an \u201cindeterminate\nsituation\u201d into a \u201cdeterminate one\u201d.\n\nThe inquiry pattern Dewey sketched is schematic; he noted that actual\ncases of reasoning often do not show such discreteness or linearity.\nThus, the pattern is not a summary of how people always think\nbut rather how exemplary cases of inquirential thinking unfold (e.g.,\nin the empirical sciences).\n\nKnowledge, as viewed by Dewey\u2019s transactional model of inquiry,\ndeparts from tradition; in effect, it is brought to earth.\n\u201cKnowledge, as an abstract term\u201d, Dewey wrote, \n\n\nis a name for the product of competent inquiries. Apart from this\nrelation, its meaning is so empty that any content or filling may be\narbitrarily poured in. (LTI, LW12: 16) \n\n\nTo understand a product, one must understand the process; this is what\nDewey does. Denying the importance of knowledge, qua isolable\nproduct, is effectively denying a metaphysical account of reality that\nmakes mind-the-substance separate from everything else. It does\nnot depreciate knowing as an activity, and Dewey strongly\nmaintained that \u201cintelligence\u201d is a crucial mediator of\nindividual and societal\n conflict.[30]\n\nTruth, too, is radically reevaluated. For too long, truth connoted an\nideal\u2014an epistemic fixity (a correspondence, a coherence) which\ncould terminate all further inquiry. As this is not the actual\nsituation human beings (or philosophy) inhabits, the ideal should be\nset aside. Still, Dewey was ever the (re)constructivist; in\n\u201cExperience, Knowledge, and Value\u201d (1939c) he provided an\naccount of truth; it no longer pointed toward some transcendental\nthing, but toward the process of inquiry (\u201cExperience,\nKnowledge, and Value\u201d, LW14: 56\u201357). To label a\nproposition \u201ctrue\u201d is to say it offers some reliability as\na resource in further inquiry: \n\n\nIn scientific inquiry, the criterion of what is taken to be settled,\nor to be knowledge, is being so settled that it is available as a\nresource in further inquiry; not being settled in such a way as not to\nbe subject to revision in further inquiry. (LTI, LW12: 16)\n\n\n\nTruth does not stand outside of experience, but is an experienced\nrelation, particularly one which is socially shared. In How We\nThink, Dewey wrote, \n\n\nTruth, in final analysis, is the statement of things \u201cas they\nare,\u201d not as they are in the inane and desolate void of\nisolation from human concern, but as they are in a shared and\nprogressive experience\u2026.Truth, truthfulness, transparent and\nbrave publicity of intercourse, are the source and the reward of\nfriendship. Truth is having things in common. (HWT, MW6: 67;\nsee also \u201cThe Experimental Theory of Knowledge\u201d, 1910b,\nMW3: 118)\n\n\nIn Dewey\u2019s instrumentalism, then, knowledge and truth are\nadjectival not nominative, they describe a process which, as Peirce\ntells us, can go on as long as we do. \u201cThere is no belief so\nsettled as not to be exposed to further inquiry\u201d (LTI, LW12:\n16). To understand why words like \u201cknowledge\u201d and\n\u201ctruth\u201d deserve to be honorifics, one must understand\ntheir historic value as tools that have aided past inquiries and\nhelped secure experiences of value.\n5. Philosophy of Education\n\nIt is probably fair to say that, around the world, Dewey remains as\nwell know for his educational theories (see\n entry on philosophy of education, section Rousseau, Dewey, and the progressive movement)\n as for his philosophical ones. However, a closer look at\nDewey\u2019s body of work shows how often these theories align. Dewey\nrecognized this, reflecting that his 1916 magnum opus in education,\nDemocracy and Education (DE, MW9) \u201cwas for\nmany years that [work] in which my philosophy, such as it is, was most\nfully expounded\u201d (FAE, LW5: 156). DE argued\nthat philosophy itself could be understood as \u201cthe general\ntheory of education\u201d. In lieu of philosophy\u2019s increasing\ntendencies to become hyper-specialized and technical, he urged a\ngreater investment in the problems affecting everyday life. In effect\nthis was a call to see philosophy from the standpoint of education.\nDewey wrote,\n\n\nEducation offers a vantage ground from which to penetrate to the\nhuman, as distinct from the technical, significance of philosophic\ndiscussions\u2026.The educational point of view enables one to\nenvisage the philosophic problems where they arise and thrive, where\nthey are at home, and where acceptance or rejection makes a difference\nin practice. If we are willing to conceive education as the process of\nforming fundamental dispositions, intellectual and emotional, toward\nnature and fellow-men, philosophy may even be defined as the\ngeneral theory of education. (DE, MW9: 338)\n\n\nDewey was active in education his entire life. Besides high school and\ncollege teaching, he devised curricula, established, reviewed and\nadministered schools and departments of education, participated in\ncollective organizing, consulted and lectured internationally, and\nwrote extensively on many facets of education. He established the\nUniversity of Chicago\u2019s Laboratory School as an experimental\nsite for theories in instrumental logic and psychological\nfunctionalism. This school also became a site for democratic\nexpression by the local community.\n5.1 Experiential Learning and Teaching\n\nDewey\u2019s \u201cReflex Arc\u201d paper applied functionalism to\neducation. \u201cReflex\u201d argued that human experience is not a\ndisjointed sequence of fits and starts, but a developing circuit of\nactivities. Learning deserves to be framed in this way: as a\ncumulative, progressive process where inquirers move from the\ndissatisfying phase of doubt toward another marked by the satisfying\nresolution of a problem. \u201cReflex\u201d also shows that the\nsubject of a stimulus (e.g., the pupil) is not a passive recipient of,\nsay, a sensation but an agent who takes it amidst other\nongoing activities in a larger environmental field.\n\nCognizance of such fundamental facts entailed, Dewey argued, that\neducators discard pedagogies based on the \u201cblank slate\u201d\nmodel of curriculum. Rather, in The School and Society, Dewey\nwrote, \u201cthe question of education is the question of taking hold\nof [children\u2019s] activities, of giving them direction\u201d\n(MW1: 25). Dewey\u2019s How We Think (1910c, MW6) was\nintended, primarily, to instruct teachers how to apply\ninstrumentalism; education\u2019s intellectual goals could be\nadvanced by acquainting children with the general intellectual habits\nof scientific inquiry. \n\n\nThe native and unspoiled attitude of childhood, marked by ardent\ncuriosity, fertile imagination, and love of experimental inquiry, is\nnear, very near, to the attitude of the scientific mind.\n(HWT, MW6: 179)\n\n\nGiven Dewey\u2019s different approach to psychology, teaching roles\nwould need revision. While teachers still had to know their subject\nmatter, they also needed to understand the student\u2019s cultural\nand personal backgrounds. Learning as an activity which incorporated\nactual problems necessitated a careful integration of lessons with\nspecific learners. Traditional motivational strategies, too, had to\nchange; rather than relying on rewards or punishments, Deweyan\nteachers were called to reimagine the whole learning environment; they\nmust merge the school\u2019s preexisting curricular goals with their\npupils\u2019 present interests. One way to do this was by identifying\nspecific problems able to bridge curriculum and student and then\ncreate situations in which students have to work them\n out.[31]\n The problem-centered approach demanded a lot from teachers, as it\nrequired training in subject matters, child psychology, and various\npedagogies capable of interweaving these\n together.[32]\n5.2 Traditionalists, Romantics, and Dewey\n\nDewey\u2019s educational philosophy emerged amidst a fierce\n1890\u2019s debate between educational \u201cromantics\u201d and\n\u201ctraditionalists\u201d. Romantics (also called\n\u201cNew\u201d or \u201cProgressive\u201d education by Dewey),\nurged a \u201cchild-centered\u201d approach; they claimed that the\nchild\u2019s natural impulses provided education\u2019s proper\nstarting point. As active and creative beings, education should not\nfetter growth\u2014even instruction should be subordinated to content\nif necessary. Traditionalists (called \u201cOld\u201d\neducation by Dewey) pressed for a \u201ccurriculum-centered\u201d\napproach. Children were empty cabinets which curriculum fills with\ncivilization\u2019s lessons. Content was supreme, and instruction\nshould discipline children to ensure they are receptive.\n\nIn many articles and books (\u201cMy Pedagogic Creed\u201d, 1897b,\nEW5; The School and Society, 1899, MW1; Democracy and\nEducation, 1916b, MW9; Experience and Education, 1938b,\nLW13, etc.) Dewey developed an interactional model to move beyond that\ndebate. He refused to privilege either child or society. While\nRomantics correctly identified the child (replete with instincts,\npowers, habits, and histories) as an indispensable starting point for\npedagogy, Dewey argued that the child cannot be the only\nstarting point. Larger social groups (family, community, nation) also\nhave a legitimate stake in passing along extant interests, needs, and\nvalues as part of an educational synthesis.\n\nStill, of these two approaches, Dewey tilted more strongly against the\nhigh value placed by traditionalists on discipline and memorization.\nWhile recognizing the legitimacy of conveying content (facts, values),\nDewey thought it paramount for schools to eschew indoctrination.\nEducating meant incorporating, with a wide berth for personal\nfreedom, unique individuals into a changing society which\u2014this\nhad to remain clear\u2014would soon be under their dominion.\nThis is why who the child was mattered so very much.\nFollowing colleague and lifelong friend G.H. Mead, Dewey argued that\nany child\u2019s \u201cself\u201d was an emerging construct of\nsocial and personal experiences, so no child\u2019s deeds, words, or\ninterests could be isolated from their social context.\nInsofar as these were facts of social psychology, schools had to\nbecome micro-communities to best reflect children\u2019s growing\ninterests and needs. \u201cThe school cannot be a preparation for\nsocial life excepting as it reproduces, within itself, the typical\nconditions of social life\u201d (\u201cEthical Principles Underlying\nEducation\u201d, 1897a, EW5:\n 61\u201362).[33]\n5.3 Democracy Through Education\n\nDewey\u2019s efforts to connect child, school, and society were\nmotivated by more than just a desire for better pedagogical methods.\nBecause character, rights, and duties are informed by and contribute\nto the social realm, schools were critical sites to learn and\nexperiment with democracy. Democratic life consists not only in civic\nand economic conduct, but more crucially in habits of problem solving,\ncompassionate imagination, creative expression, and civic\nself-governance. The full range of roles a child might assume in life\nis vast; once this is appreciated, it is incumbent upon society to\nmake education its highest political and economic priority. During\nWWII, Dewey wrote, \n\n\nThere will be almost a revolution in school education when study and\nlearning are treated not as acquisition of what others know but as\ndevelopment of capital to be invested in eager alertness in observing\nand judging the conditions under which one lives. Yet until this\nhappens, we shall be ill-prepared to deal with a world whose\noutstanding trait is change. (\u201cBetween Two Worlds\u201d, 1944,\nLW17: 463)\n\n\nDemocracy, on Dewey\u2019s view, was much more comprehensive than a\nform of government. \u201cDemocracy\u201d, Dewey wrote, \u201cis\nnot an alternative to other principles of associated life [but] the\nidea of community life itself\u201d (PP, LW2: 328).\nIndividuals exist in communities; as their lives change, needs and\nconflicts emerge that require intelligent management; we must make\nsense out of new experiences. Education \n\n\nis that reconstruction or reorganization of experience which adds to\nthe meaning of experience, and which increases ability to direct the\ncourse of subsequent experience. (DE, MW9: 82) \n\n\nIn other words, the engine of America\u2019s political identity was\ncreative experimentation; in order to fulfill their eventual roles as\nfully participating citizens, students needed education in the habits\n(imaginative, empirical) which made the experimental sciences so\nsuccessful. Dewey called such attitudes and habits\n \u201cintelligence\u201d.[34]\n\nInforming all the spheres just discussed\u2014science, education, and\ndemocratic life\u2014is Dewey\u2019s naturalism which places hope\nnot in what is immutable or ultimate (God, Nature, Reason, Ends) but\nin the human capacity to learn from life. In \u201cCreative\nDemocracy\u2014The Task Before Us\u201d (1939b) Dewey wrote,\n\n\nDemocracy is the faith that the process of experience is more\nimportant than any special result attained, so that special results\nachieved are of ultimate value only as they are used to enrich and\norder the ongoing process. Since the process of experience is capable\nof being educative, faith in democracy is all one with faith in\nexperience and education. All ends and values that are cut off from\nthe ongoing process become arrests, fixations. They strive to fixate\nwhat has been gained instead of using it to open the road and point\nthe way to new and better experiences. (\u201cCreative\nDemocracy\u201d, LW14: 229)\n\n\nThe success or failure of democracy rests on education. Education is\nmost determinative of whether citizens develop the habits needed to\ninvestigate problematic beliefs and situations, to communicate openly,\nthroughout. While every culture aims to convey values and beliefs to\nthe coming generation, it is critical, Dewey thought, to distinguish\nbetween education which inculcates collaborative and creative\nhypothesizing and education which foments obeisance to parochialism\nand dogma. And philosophy must apply this same standard to itself.\n6. Ethics\n\nDewey wrote extensively on ethics throughout his career; some writings\nwere explicitly about ethics, but ethical analyses are present in\nworks with other\n foci.[35]\n As elsewhere, Dewey critiques then reconstructs traditional views; he\nargued it is typical for traditional systems (e.g., teleological,\ndeontological, or virtue-based) to seek comprehensive and monocausal\naccounts of, for example, ultimate aims, duties, or values. Such ideal\ntheory is obligated to explain morality\u2019s requirements for all\nindividuals actions or character.\n\nDewey, in contrast, argued for a more experimental approach. Rather\nthan a grand and final explanatory account of moral life, ethics\ndescribes intelligent methods for dealing with novel and morally\nperplexing situations. There are no stipulated, ultimate values, nor\nshould any be\n sought.[36]\n At best, the only value toward which he would gesture was\n \u201cgrowth\u201d.[37]\n Ethics means inquiry into concrete, problematic conditions; such\ninquiry may use theories to inform hypotheses tested in experience.\nReliable hypotheses may come to be called \u201cknowledge\u201d, but\nmust, in the end, be considered fallible and revisable. Actual\nresolutions to moral problems, Dewey observed, typically point toward\nplural factors (aims, duties, virtues), rather than just one\n(TIF, LW5). Moreover, actual conduct (including inquiry) is\nundertaken not by isolated, rational actors but by\nfundamentally social\n beings.[38]\n \u201cConduct\u201d, Dewey wrote, \n\n\nis always shared; this is the difference between it and a\nphysiological process. It is not an ethical \u201cought\u201d that\nconduct should be social. It is social, whether bad\nor good. (HNC, MW14: 16)\n\n\nDewey\u2019s ethical theory, like those in education and politics,\nutilizes his transactional views of experience, habit, inquiry, and\nthe communicative, social self. It also exemplifies Dewey\u2019s\nmetaphysics of a world both precarious and stable, where\nconflict is natural and quests to deny or permanently eradicate it are\n fantastical.[39]\n Conflict is a generic trait of life, not a defect; theories denying\nthis tend to be so reductive and absolutist that they divorce inquiry\nfrom the essential details of concrete situations, cultures, and\npersons. Such strategies tend to\n fail.[40]\n\nProgress in ethical theory, then, means improvements that render\ninquiry more discriminating, more revelatory of alternatives and\n consequences.[41]\n Improved deliberation is crucial to more effective inquiry; Dewey\nargued this requires being open to contributions from many sources:\nall sciences, social customs, jurisprudence, biographies, and, yes,\neven moral systems of the\n past.[42]\n Deliberation especially benefits from what Dewey called\n\u201cdramatic rehearsal\u201d, where creative and dramatic\nenactment adds to logical tools and helps illuminate the emotional\nweight and color of potential ethical\n choices.[43]\n\nFor further details on Dewey\u2019s ethics, see the entry\n Dewey\u2019s moral philosophy\n by E. Anderson (2018). \n7. Political Philosophy\n\nDewey\u2019s political philosophy, like other areas, presumes that\nthat individuals subsist transactionally with their social\nenvironment, and can use inquiry to solve problems in hypothetical and\nexperimental\n ways.[44]\n As elsewhere, theory is instrumental; concepts and systems are tools\ninitially devised to function in particular, practical circumstances.\nWhile those proving valuable can be retained for reuse, all are\nconsidered fallible and capable of reconstruction. Dewey rejected\napproaches relying upon non-empirical, a priori assumptions\n(e.g., about human nature, historical progress, etc.) or which propose\nultimate, often monocausal, explanations. Dewey criticized and\nreconstructed core political concepts (individual, freedom, right,\ncommunity, public, state, and democracy) along naturalist and\nexperimentalist lines; besides numerous articles (for academic and lay\naudiences), Dewey\u2019s political thought can be found in books such\nas The Public and Its Problems (1927b, LW2),\nIndividualism, Old and New (1930f, LW5), Liberalism and\nSocial Action (1935, LW11), and Freedom and Culture\n(1939d, LW13). Because Democracy and Education (1916b,\nDE, MW9) emphasizes profound connections between education,\nsociety, and democratic habits\u2014it also merits study as a\n\u201cpolitical\u201d work.\n\nEnormous changes took place during Dewey\u2019s lifetime, including\nmassive US population growth, the rise of industrial, scientific,\ntechnological, and educational institutions, the American Civil War\nand two world wars, and a global economic depression. These events\nstrained prevailing liberal theories, and Dewey labored to revise both\ndemocracy and liberalism. \u201cThe frontier is moral, not\nphysical\u201d, Dewey urged, proposing that democracy was tantamount\nto a \u201cway of life\u201d, and required continual renewal to\n survive.[45]\n Beyond governmental machinery (universal suffrage, recurring\nelections, political parties, trial by peers, etc.), democracy was\n\u201cprimarily a mode of associated living, of conjoint communicated\nexperience\u201d (DE, MW9: 93; see also, PP, LW2:\n325). Such experience, expressed as collaborative inquiry, required\nthe intellectual and emotional competencies necessary to tackle shared\nproblems and negotiate value differences. Ultimately, democracy\nrequires faith in experience as a sufficient resource for future\nsolutions and that it is no longer necessary to place faith into\ntranscendent rules or\n aims.[46]\n\nDewey\u2019s analysis of individualism grew both from earlier\nacademic interests and from his sensitivity to contemporary economic\nand technological\n pressures.[47]\n The older \u201catomic\u201d individualism\u2014where natural\negoists vie to maximize their standing\u2014was now harming not\nprotecting individuals; such individualism, deployed as a rhetorical\npretext, was enabling the wealthy and powerful to undermine (for most)\nthe protections which justified liberalism,\n initially![48]\n\nDewey\u2019s counter-proposal was \u201crenascent\n liberalism\u201d.[49]\n By reconstructing its core concept (\u201catomic\u201d individuals\nbecome \u201csocial\u201d), Dewey also revised other key political\nnotions\u2014e.g., \u201cliberty\u201d, \u201cfreedom\u201d, and\n\u201crights\u201d,\u2014and placed them in an instrumentalist\nframework (LSA, LW11: 35; E, MW5:\n 394).[50]\n Also revised are concomitant notions of \u201ccommunity\u201d and\n\u201cpublic\u201d. The Deweyan \u201cpublic\u201d forms around\nproblems; the aim is to conduct experimental inquiry and act for\nredress (PP, LW2: 314). Dewey also expressed a grave concern,\nstill with us today, regarding \u201cinchoate\u201d publics. Such\npublics consist of members lacking the critical education, time, and\nattention necessary for inquiry. They present democracy with perhaps\nits most significant and undermining condition (PP, LW2: 321,\n317).\n\nFor further details on Dewey\u2019s political theory, see the entry\non\n Dewey\u2019s political philosophy\n by M. Festenstein (2014).\n8. Art and Aesthetic Experience\n\nIn his magnum opus on aesthetics, Art as Experience\n(AE, LW10: 31) Dewey stated that art, as a conscious idea, is\n\u201cthe greatest intellectual achievement in the history of\nhumanity\u201d\n (31).[51]\n Such high praise, especially from a philosopher with expertise in\n(what remains) philosophy\u2019s \u201cmain\u201d subjects (e.g.,\nknowledge, ethics, science) deserves notice. Dewey began writing about\naesthetics from early in his career\u2014on art\u2019s relevance to psychology (1887, EW2) and education (1897c, EW5), on why the distinction between \n\n\u201cfine\u201d and \n\n\u201cpractical\u201d art should be rejected (1891, EW3: 310-311), and on Bosanquet (1893, EW4). His own theory emerged in\nExperience and Nature (1925a, EN, LW1) and\nflourished in AE (1934b), proposing that aesthetics is\ncentral to philosophy\u2019s proper mission: to render everyday\nexperience more fulfilling and meaningful.\n\nDewey\u2019s aesthetics has, arguably, four main objectives. First,\nit explicates art\u2019s ontology, the interrelated processes of\nmaking and appreciation, and specifies the functions of interpretation\nand\n criticism.[52]\n Second, it examines arts\u2019 social role in presenting,\nreimagining, and projecting human identity. Third, it analyzes the\ncommunicative functions of art, especially in education and political\nlife. Finally, it describes and analyzes the implications of\nart\u2019s expression as experience; such experience is so vivified\nand integrated as to be qualitatively distinct\u2014experience as\n \u201cconsummatory\u201d.[53]\n Consummatory experience happens occasionally; sometimes it occurs not\nin an \u201cartistic\u201d context (concert, museum, etc.) but in\nunexpectedly quotidian circumstances. Nevertheless, it is also life at\nits fullest. Determining how more of life\u2019s experiences\ncould become consummatory is the main purpose of Dewey\u2019s\naesthetics.\n\nThus, the main question AE poses is: How did a chasm arise\nbetween the arts, artists and ordinary people? How have cultural\nconditions and aesthetic theories (reinforced by institutions)\nisolated \u201cart and its appreciation by placing them in a realm of\ntheir own, disconnected from other modes of experiencing\u201d?\n(AE, LW10: 16) AE makes explicit art\u2019s natural\ncontinuities with everyday life, while seeking to prevent its\nreduction to mere entertainment or \u201ctransient pleasurable\n excitations\u201d[54]\n (AE, LW10: 16). Dewey criticizes traditional\naesthetics\u2019 spectatorial (or theoretical) starting point and\ngoes on to offer radically empirical accounts of art making,\nappreciation, expression, form, and criticism. Because aesthetic\nexperience has organic roots, it can be recognized even in everyday\nobjects and\n events.[55]\n Again, the goal is to dissolve the dualisms between\n\u201cfine\u201d and \u201cuseful\u201d objects and to help\nestablish a greater \u201ccontinuity of esthetic experience with\nnormal processes of living\u201d (AE, LW10: 16).\n\nFor further details on Dewey\u2019s aesthetics, see entry on\n Dewey\u2019s aesthetics\n by T. Leddy (2016).\n9. Religion, Religious Experience and A Common Faith\n\n\nThe whole story of man shows that there are no objects that may not\ndeeply stir engrossing emotion. One of the few experiments in the\nattachment of emotion to ends that mankind has not tried is that of\ndevotion, so intense as to be religious, to intelligence as a force in\nsocial action. (A Common Faith,\n1934a, LW9: 52\u201353) \n\n9.1 Dewey\u2019s Religious Background\n\nDewey grew up in a religious family; his mother was especially devout\nand pressured her sons to live up to a similar devotion. His family\nchurch was Congregationalist; a bit later, including in college,\nLiberal Evangelicalism proved to be a more acceptable form of\nChristianity. At twenty-one, while living in Oil City, Pennsylvania,\nDewey had a \u201cmystic experience\u201d which he reported to\nfriend Max Eastman: \n\n\nThere was no vision, not even a definable emotion\u2014just a\nsupremely blissful feeling that his worries [about whether he prayed\nsufficiently in earnest] were over. (Dykhuizen 1973: 22) \n\n\nDewey belonged to congregations for about thirty-five years and turned\naway circa 1894, as he left for a post in Chicago. From then on,\nDewey\u2019s deepest loyalties lay outside religion; he was, as John\nJ. McDermott put it, \n\n\nan unregenerate philosophical naturalist, one for whom the human\njourney is constitutive of its own meaning and is not to be rescued by\nany transcendent explanations, principles of accountability, or\nposthumous salvation. (McDermott 2006, 50\u201351)\n\n\nDewey returned to philosophical issues of religion in the\n1930\u2019s. \u201cWhat I Believe\u201d (1930, LW5) argued for a\nnew kind of \u201cfaith\u201d, a \u201ctendency toward\naction\u201d. Such a faith would not be directed transcendentally,\nbut would signify that \u201cexperience itself is the sole ultimate\nauthority\u201d (\u201cWhat I Believe\u201d, LW5: 267). This is not\nself-enclosed experience, of course, but comes from \u201cthe full\nparticipation of all our powers in the endeavor to wrest from each\nchanging situation of experience its own full and unique\nmeaning\u201d (\u201cWhat I Believe\u201d, LW5: 272). In\n1933\u201334, Dewey gave the Terry Lectures at Yale, later published\nas A Common Faith (1934a, ACF, LW9), Dewey\u2019s\nmajor statement on religion and religious experience.\n9.2 Aligning Naturalism and Religion\n\nThe challenge A Common Faith took on seems, in retrospect,\ninsurmountable. He wished to reconstruct religion in a way which\nharmonized it with his empiricism and naturalism, while showing how\nthe power of religious experience and belief could be transformed in\nways which supported and advanced a secular conception of democracy.\nReligions vary, of course, but to a large degree they posit\ntranscendent, eternal, unobservable entities and reveal themselves in\nways which are not, shall we say, open to verification. Empirical\nexperience (regardless of its specific construal) is seen as\ninferior\u2014whether castigated as flux, illusion, uncertainty, or\nconfusion, it must be left behind. In short, Dewey had squared himself\nagainst the metaphysics, epistemology, and seemingly the morality, of\nmajor religions.\n\nIt is worth noting who were ACF\u2019s intended audience.\nDewey was not addressing believers contented with\nsupernatural religion, nor religious liberals seeking a\nvia media postulating discrete realms to scientific and\nspiritual truths. Also, he was not addressing militant\natheists, whose dogmatism Dewey\n rejected.[56]\n Rather, ACF addressed those who, despite their abandonment\nof supernaturalism, nevertheless believe themselves to be religious\n(\u201cExperience, Knowledge, and Value\u201d, LW14: 79\u201380).\nACF was meant to salvage whatever made the religious attitude\nexperientially valuable while shedding both traditional religious\nframeworks and supernaturalistic beliefs.\n9.3 \u201cReligion\u201d vs. \u201cReligious\u201d\n\nDewey\u2019s strategy, then, was to pry \u201creligious\u201d\nexperience away from religion, to show how religious experience may be\nframed within a natural and social\n context.[57]\n Because Dewey can find no clear, univocal meaning for\n\u201creligion\u201d, the alternative was to look more closely at\nreligious experience (ACF, LW9: 7). To mention just two\nconclusions, Dewey found that whichever qualities exhibited by\nreligious experience (feelings of peace, wholeness, security, etc.),\nnone offered evidence for the supernatural. In other words, a\nreligious experience\u2019s report can no more count as a\njudgment about causation than pointing to a book\u2019s description\ncan prove a physical law (ACF, LW9ff.).\n\nA second conclusion was that religious experience is not hermetic,\nunable to color or affect other experiences. Just a sunset may have an\n\u201caesthetic\u201d element or a linguistic remark may have a\n\u201cmoral\u201d tint, there may be a religious coloration of a\nvariety of experiences (ACF, LW9: 9.). Understood in this\nsense, the \u201creligious\u201d character of experience is an\nattitude, one lending \u201cdeep and enduring support to the\nprocesses of living\u201d (ACF, LW9: 15). Dewey analyzed\nreligiosity in this sense by comparing it with a certain kind of\ncoping. Consider three options: (1) one can accommodate an\nobstacle by merely resigning to put up with the conditions they\nimpose; (2) one can adapt or modify the obstacle\u2019s\nconditions to one\u2019s liking; finally, (3) one can adjust\nto the obstacle in such a way that one both changes\none\u2019s attitude and alters the conditions. (Consider, as\nadjustment, the case of of becoming a parent which\ndemands significant changes that encompass both self\nand environment.) This last option (3) of adjustment\nis characteristic of religious experience for it is \u201cinclusive\nand deep seated\u201d and transformative of attitudes in\n\u201cgeneric and enduring\u201d ways (ACF, LW9: 12,13). In\nadjustment, imaginative possibilities are projected and then put into\naction\u2014both in oneself (wants, aims, ideals) and in surrounding\nconditions\u2014and the cumulative impact is an evolution of identity\n(ACF, LW9:\n 13).[58]\n9.4 Faith and God\n\nDewey effort to naturalize religion (by shifting the focus toward a\nnon-transcendental understanding of \u201creligious\nexperience\u201d) also required a reinterpretation of other\ntraditional notions\u2014such as \u201cfaith\u201d and\n\u201cGod\u201d. Faith, typically, is juxtaposed with reason. Faith\nrequires neither empirical inquiry nor verification; one has faith in\nthe evidence of (transcendent, ultimate) things not seen. Also, faith\ntypically connotes intellectual acceptance, again without proof, of\nreligious propositions (such as \u201cGod exists and loves\nmankind\u201d).\n\nDewey made at least two important criticisms of traditional faith.\nFirst, faith is too closely identified with intellectual\nacceptance, which eclipses its pragmatic side; faith in a\ncause, for example, indicates a practical willingness to\nact strong enough to modify present desires, purposes, and\nconduct. By over-identifying the meaning of faith with intellectual\nrecognition, the traditional account attenuates inquiry and\nconstructive action. Second, traditional faith tends to reify its\nobjects (e.g., \u201csin\u201d, \u201cevil\u201d, etc.) converting\nthem, in effect, to surds immune to inquiry and redescription. The\nresulting creed is then deployed to \u201csolve\u201d problems with\nformulaic appeals to absolutes. In Dewey\u2019s view, the better\napproach is experimental\u2014complicated, living problems are more\neffectively address with experimental inquiry. Insofar as traditional\nfaith frustrates inquiry which could be ameliorative, it runs counter\nto the aims of morality.\n\nThe faith Dewey can accept is \u201cnatural piety\u201d.\nNatural piety is not grounded in unseen, supernatural powers but,\nDewey wrote, in a \u201cjust sense of nature as the whole of which we\nare parts\u201d and the recognition that as parts we are \n\n\nmarked by intelligence and purpose, having the capacity to strive by\ntheir aid to bring conditions into greater consonance with what is\nhumanly desirable. (ACF, LW9: 18) \n\n\nFaith grounded in natural piety accepts the idea that (again)\n\u201cexperience itself is the sole ultimate authority\u201d\n(\u201cWhat I Believe\u201d, LW5: 267).\n\nDewey\u2019s naturalism, of course, disallows a traditional\nGod\u2014a single being responsible for the physical and moral\nuniverse, and its inhabitants. Belief in God is neither warranted nor\nadvisable. Instead, Dewey offers a reconstruction of\n\u201cGod\u201d. Very briefly, he asks that we think not of a\nsingular object but of the qualities to which God is\ncompared\u2014goodness, wisdom, love. Such descriptions show that God\nrepresents our highest ideals. Remove the idea of a possessor\nof ideals and add in the way in which ideals pull from us the\nmeans (imagination, calculation, action) to put make ideas actual\n\u2014and one begins to grasp Dewey\u2019s notion. \n\n\nThis idea of God, or of the divine is also connected with all the\nnatural forces and conditions\u2014including man and human\nassociation\u2014that promote the growth of the ideal and that\nfurther its realization\u2026.It is this active relation between\nideal and actual to which I would give the name \u201cGod\u201d.\n(ACF, LW9: 34; see also 29\u201330)\n\n9.5 Religion as Social Intelligence\u2014a Common Faith\n\nAs a pragmatist, a meliorist, and a humane democrat, Dewey sought a\nway to harness the undeniable power of religion and religious\nexperience toward an end beneficial to all. Religion, he understood,\nprovides people with a story about the larger universe and how they\nfit within it. He knew it was not enough to criticize religion,\nbecause this leaves powerful human needs unmet. Dewey did not propose\nswapping out old religious institutions for new ones; he hoped,\nrather, that the emancipation of religious experience from\ninstitutional and ideological shackles might direct its energies\ntoward something like a \u201ccommon faith\u201d, a passion for\nimaginative intelligence pursuing moral goods. The methods of inquiry\nand criticism are not mysteries; they are deeply familiar already. The\nnecessary turn would come when religious persons realize that inquiry\ncould be extended to enhance religious experience and values\n(ACF, LW9: 23). If it could be appreciated how many\ncelebrated accomplishments were due not to God but to intelligent,\nhuman collaboration, then perhaps the idea of community could\ninspire a non-sectarian, common\n faith.[59]\n\nDewey\u2019s call for a common faith was, he thought, deeply\ndemocratic. Why? Because the idea of the supernatural was, by\ndefinition, suspicious of experience (as an adequate guide) and,\nconsequently, suspicious of empirical methods of inquiry. Unchecked by\nlived experience or experiment, supernaturalism can produce especially\ndeep divisions. The approach of Dewey\u2019s common faith is, in\ncontrast, intertwined with experimental inquiry\u2014drawing upon\nlived experience and constantly renewed through open communication.\nThis is why Dewey\u2019s exhortation to trade traditional religious\nfaith for a common faith in empirical intelligence is of a piece with\nhis experimental ideal of democracy.\n",
