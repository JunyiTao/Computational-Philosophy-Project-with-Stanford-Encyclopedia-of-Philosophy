    "main_text": "General Characterization of Carnap\u2019s Philosophy || Verification and Confirmation\n1.5 Verification and Confirmation\n\nCarnap\u2019s life-long quest to explicate the distinction between\nstatements that genuinely convey something and empty verbiage that\nonly purports to say something (metaphysics) began with\nWittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus, the Vienna Circle\u2019s\nprovisional starting point. The Circle interpreted Wittgenstein as\nrequiring what Carnap later called a \u201cmolecular\u201d language,\nby which he meant a language that permitted only finitely restricted\nquantification. This posed an obvious problem in that scientific\ntheories, the very paradigm of what the Circle regarded as proper\n(non-metaphysical) knowledge, nearly all contain unrestricted\nuniversal quantifiers and thus range, in principle, over an infinite\nnumber of instances. As Carnap already acknowledged in his first\nwritings on the subject, well before Popper appeared on the scene,\nthis meant that theories could not, strictly speaking, be verified;\nthey could only be confirmed up to a certain confidence level, or\ndisconfirmed (e.g., Carnap 1926: 7\u20139).\n\nAs we will see in\n section 5\n below, this and related problems constituted a large part of the\nCircle\u2019s agenda during the late 1920s and early 1930s. The\nimportant thing to keep in mind through all this is that \u201cthe\nverification principle\u201d in its crude form was never advocated by\nCarnap or any other major figure in the Circle. (More detail on this\nin the supplement on\n The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 1).)\n In the Aufbau, Carnap had, it is true, worked out a\nfinitist, \u201cmolecular\u201d phenomenalist language and advocated\nthe epistemological benefits of reconstructing scientific concepts on\nits basis. During this period, he was attracted to a form of radical\npositivism that played down theories as mere auxiliary devices for the\nprediction of observations. The observations that confirm theories, in\nthis view, was really all there was to science, in what amounted to a\nkind of instrumentalism about theories, as it would later be\ncalled.\n\nBut soon afterwards, in his Logical Syntax, and more\nexplicitly when he published \u201cTestability and Meaning\u201d in\n1936\u201337, Carnap decisively distanced himself from such\ndoctrines. In the light of the new principle of tolerance, the\nobsession with just one standard language form seemed unnecessarily\n\u201cabsolutist\u201d and rigid. In \u201cTestability and\nMeaning\u201d it is stressed that many different language forms are\npossible in science and should be investigated, and that none is\n\u201ccorrect\u201d or uniquely acceptable for the purposes of\nscientific confirmation. The point is to devise languages that meet\ncertain goals of inquiry better than others, in the awareness that\nsome languages may be better for the pursuit of one goal, while other\nlanguages are preferable for other goals. This is perhaps the first\nfully explicit expression of the engineering ethos described in\nsection 1.1 above.\n\nThis period also marks a return to the recognition that radical\npositivism of the \u201cmolecular\u201d or Tractatus sort\nhardly does justice to actual science\u2014so Carnap returns now to\nscience as it actually is done rather than an idealized, purely\nfactual science. This meant, once again, an acceptance that\ntheoretical vocabulary needed to be accounted for in one\u2019s\nconception of science. Another kind of concept characteristic of\nactually practiced science that gets special attention in\n\u201cTestability and Meaning\u201d is disposition concepts (e.g.,\n\u201csoluble\u201d or \u201crefrangible\u201d; more on\ndisposition concepts in the supplement\n The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 2)).\n Probabilistic concepts would soon come into focus as well as a\nsignificant preoccupation.\n",
