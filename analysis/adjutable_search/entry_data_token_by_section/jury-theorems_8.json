[An\n extended description of Figure 3\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nFigure 3\n illustrates how the competence assumption evolves:\n\nCondorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem focuses on general\ncompetence, i.e., the fixed probability \\(P(R_{i})\\), which must\nexceed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) (see Plot a).\nThe Conditional Jury Theorem focuses on specific\ncompetence, i.e., the facts-dependent probability\n\\(P(R_{i}|\\mathbf{x})\\), which must always exceed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). If\none takes \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) to be the state of the world, i.e., considers\nthe State-Conditional Jury Theorem, then (assuming the state\nis binary) only two competence levels are possible, one for each state\n(see Plot b1). Richer facts allow for many possible competence levels\n(see Plot b2).\nThe Competence-Sensitive Jury Theorem assumes, less demandingly,\nthat specific competence tends to exceed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) (see\nPlot c).\n\n\nMathematically, the Competence-Sensitive Jury Theorem generalises the\nConditional Jury Theorem, which generalises Condorcet\u2019s Jury\nTheorem. Why?\n\nThe Competence-Sensitive Jury Theorem encompasses the Conditional\nJury Theorem as a special case, the case when CC holds, because in\nthis extreme case (of always competent voters) the theorem\nasserts asymptotic\n infallibility.[11]\nThe Conditional Jury Theorem encompasses Condorcet\u2019s Jury\nTheorem as a special case, obtained when plugging in a trivial facts\nvariable \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) with only one possible value. Here the\npremises CI and CC reduce to Condorcet\u2019s premises UI and UC,\nbecause conditionalising on facts that are certain is like not\nconditionalising at all.\n\n",
