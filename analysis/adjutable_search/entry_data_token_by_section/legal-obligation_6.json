    "main_text": "Transactional Theories || Gratitude\n4.3 Gratitude\n\nFairness (in its voluntaristic interpretation) requires some sort of\nacceptance, as opposed to mere receipt, of the benefits produced by\nthe state in order for political obligation to be generated. However,\nsome transactions seem to generate obligations, despite the fact that\nthe benefits received have not been accepted. For example, if you\nprovide me with a benefit, I ought at least to be grateful, and\nexpress my gratitude in a suitable form. Couldn\u2019t this idea be\nused to justify political obligation? Some argue that it can. Obeying\nthe law, according to them, is a way for us to discharge the duty of\ngratitude we owe our own state for the benefits we receive from it\n(Plato [Crito]; W. D Ross 1930; Walker 1988; Klosko\n1989).\n\nOne problem with this account is that the mere receipt of a benefit\ndoesn\u2019t seem enough to warrant a duty of gratitude. Perhaps I\nenjoy listening to your trombone practice, but if you provide this\nbenefit to me unwittingly (perhaps you think that I\u2019m away on\nholiday, while you practice next door) do I owe you a duty of\ngratitude? And do I owe you a duty if your intention is to harm me,\nrather than benefit me? (Perhaps you know I\u2019m next door, and you\npractice loudly in order to bother me, unaware that there\u2019s\nnothing I enjoy more than listening to your trombone.) This seems\nimplausible. The mere provision of a benefit doesn\u2019t seem to\ngenerate duties of gratitude, unless the benefit in question is\nprovided with the right intention. But can states have intentions to\nbegin with (if not in a metaphorical sense)? Those who deny that\nconclude that, for this reason, no duties of gratitude can be owed to\nthem (Simmons 1979: ch. 7; but see Knowles 2002).\n\nThis objection is, in a sense, symmetrical to one considered in\nrelation to fair-play accounts. There we saw that merely receiving the\nservices provided by the state is not enough to ground political\nobligation unless those receiving these benefits have certain mental\nstates (i.e., the intention to accept the benefits). Here the\nobjection is that receiving the same services is not enough to ground\npolitical obligation unless those providing them have certain mental\nstates (i.e., the intention to benefit their recipients). However,\nit\u2019s worth noticing that the former objection applies here as\nwell. As we have seen, the services provided by the state are hard to\navoid and, more importantly, the demands that states make on us are\nthe same whether we welcome those services or not. But the claim that\nwe can incur duties of gratitude for benefits that we don\u2019t\nwelcome, and perhaps explicitly reject, seems controversial. Once\nagain, it might be that it\u2019s irrational to reject the benefits,\nbut if we do (and we are sincere), it\u2019s unclear that any costs\nmay be imposed on us as a way of discharging our duties of\ngratitude.\n",
