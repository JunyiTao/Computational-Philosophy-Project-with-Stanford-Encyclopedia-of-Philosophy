    "main_text": "The Persian Letters\n3. The Persian Letters\n\n\nThe Persian Letters is an epistolary novel consisting of\nletters sent to and from two fictional Persians, Usbek and Rica, who\nset out for Europe in 1711 and remain there at least until 1720, when\nthe novel ends. When Montesquieu wrote the Persian Letters,\ntravellers' accounts of their journeys to hitherto unknown parts of\nthe world, and of the peculiar customs they found there, were very\npopular in Europe. While Montesquieu was not the first writer to try\nto imagine how European culture might look to travellers from\nnon-European countries, he used that device with particular\nbrilliance.\n\n Many of the letters are brief descriptions of scenes or\ncharacters. At first their humor derives mostly from the fact that\nUsbek and Rica misinterpret what they see. Thus, for instance, Rica\nwrites that the Pope is a magician who can \"make the king believe that\nthree are only one, or else that the bread one eats is not bread, or\nthat the wine one drinks is not wine, and a thousand other things of\nthe same kind\" (Letter 24); when Rica goes to the theater, he\nconcludes that the spectators he sees in private boxes are actors\nenacting dramatic tableaux for the entertainment of the audience. In\nlater letters, Usbek and Rica no longer misinterpret what they see;\nhowever, they find the actions of Europeans no less\nincomprehensible. They describe people who are so consumed by vanity\nthat they become ridiculous, scholars whose concern for the minutiae\nof texts blinds them to the world around them, and a scientist who\nnearly freezes to death because lighting a fire in his room would\ninterfere with his attempt to obtain exact measurements of its\ntemperature.\n\n Interspersed among these descriptive letters are the Persians'\nreflections on what they see. Usbek is particularly given to such\nmusings, and he shares many of Montesquieu's own preoccupations: with\nthe contrast between European and non-European societies, the\nadvantages and disadvantages of different systems of government, the\nnature of political authority, and the proper role of law. He also\nseems to share many of Montesquieu's views. The best government, he\nsays, is that \"which attains its purpose with the least trouble\", and\n\"controls men in the manner best adapted to their inclinations and\ndesires\" (Letter 80). He notes that the French are moved by a love of\nhonor to obey their king, and quotes approvingly the claim that this\n\"makes a Frenchman, willingly and with pleasure, do things that your\nSultan can only get out of his subjects by ceaseless exhortation with\nrewards and punishments\" (Letter 89). While he is vividly aware of the\nimportance of just laws, he regards legal reform as a dangerous task\nto be attempted \"only in fear and trembling\" (Letter 129). He favors\nreligious toleration, and regards attempts to compel religious belief\nas both unwise and inhumane. In these reflections Usbek seems to be a\nthoughtful and enlightened observer with a deep commitment to justice.\n\n However, one of the great themes of the Persian Letters is the\nvirtual impossibility of self-knowledge, and Usbek is its most fully\nrealized illustration. Usbek has left behind a harem in Persia, in\nwhich his wives are kept prisoner by eunuchs who are among his\nslaves. Both his wives and his slaves can be beaten, mutilated, or\nkilled at his command, as can any outsider unfortunate enough to lay\neyes on them. Usbek is, in other words, a despot in his home. From the\noutset he is tortured by the thought of his wives' infidelity. It is\nnot, he writes, that he loves his wives, but that \"from my very lack\nof feeling has come a secret jealousy which is devouring me\" (Letter\n6). As time goes on problems develop in the seraglio: Usbek's wives\nfeud with each other, and the eunuchs find it increasingly difficult\nto keep order. Eventually discipline breaks down altogether; the Chief\nEunuch reports this to Usbek and then abruptly dies. His replacement\nis clearly obedient not to Usbek but to his wives: he contrives not to\nreceive any of Usbek's letters, and when a young man is found in the\nseraglio he writes: \"I got up, examined the matter, and found that it\nwas a vision\" (Letter 149). Usbek orders another eunuch to restore\norder: \"leave pity and tenderness behind. ... Make my seraglio what it\nwas when I left it; but begin by expiation: exterminate the criminals,\nand strike dread into those who contemplated becoming so. There is\nnothing that you cannot hope to receive from your master for such an\noutstanding service\" (Letter 153). His orders are obeyed, and \"horror,\ndarkness, and dread rule the seraglio\" (Letter 156). Finally, Roxana,\nUsbek's favorite wife and the only one whose virtue he trusted, is\nfound with another man; her lover is killed, and she commits suicide\nafter writing Usbek a scathing letter in which she asks: \"How could\nyou have thought me credulous enough to imagine that I was in the\nworld only in order to worship your caprices? that while you allowed\nyourself everything, you had the right to thwart all my desires? No: I\nmay have lived in servitude, but I have always been free. I have\namended your laws according to the laws of nature, and my mind has\nalways remained independent\" (Letter 161). With this letter the novel\nends.\n\n The Persian Letters is both one of the funniest books written\nby a major philosopher, and one of the bleakest. It presents both\nvirtue and self-knowledge as almost unattainable. Almost all the\nEuropeans in the Persian Letters are ridiculous; most of those\nwho are not appear only to serve as a mouthpiece for Montesquieu's own\nviews. Rica is amiable and good-natured, but this is largely due to\nthe fact that, since he has no responsibilities, his virtue has never\nbeen seriously tested. For all Usbek's apparent enlightenment and\nhumanity, he turns out to be a monster whose cruelty does not bring\nhim happiness, as he himself recognizes even as he decides to inflict\nit. His eunuchs, unable to hope for either freedom or happiness, learn\nto enjoy tormenting their charges, and his wives, for the most part,\nprofess love while plotting intrigues. The only admirable character in\nthe novel is Roxana, but the social institutions of Persia make her\nlife intolerable: she is separated from the man she loves and forced\nto live in slavery. Her suicide is presented as a noble act, but also\nas an indictment of the despotic institutions that make it necessary.\n",
