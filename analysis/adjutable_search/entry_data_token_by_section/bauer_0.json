    "main_text": "Career\n1. Career\n\nBruno Bauer was born on 6 September, 1809 in the town of Eisenberg in\nThuringia, south-eastern Germany. In 1815, Bauer\u2019s family moved\nto Berlin, where his father was employed in the royal porcelain\nfactory in Charlottenburg. At the University of Berlin\n(1828\u20131834),he studied under Hegel, Schleiermacher, and the\nHegelians Hotho and Marheineke. On Hegel\u2019s recommendation,\nBauer\u2019s 1829 essay on Kant\u2019s aesthetics won the Prussian\nroyal prize in philosophy. From 1834 to 1839, he lectured on theology\nand biblical texts in Berlin. He was transferred to the theology\nfaculty at Bonn after publishing an attack on his colleague and former\nteacher Hengstenberg. He taught in Bonn from 1839 till spring 1842,\nwhen he was dismissed for the unorthodoxy of his writings on the New\nTestament. The dismissal followed a consultation by the ministry of\neducation with the theology faculties of the six Prussian\nuniversities, but no consensus emerged from the academic inquest. The\norder for Bauer\u2019s dismissal came directly from the King of\nPrussia, Friedrich Wilhelm IV, who had decreed the suspension from\nstate employment of participants in a banquet to honour the South\nGerman liberal Karl Welcker, held in Berlin in 1841. On that occasion,\nBauer had proposed a toast to Hegel\u2019s conception of the\nstate.\n\nFrom 1842 to 1849, Bauer was active in political journalism and\nhistorical research on the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. He\nargued against the emancipation of Prussian Jews in 1842\u201343,\nseeing this proposal as a political legitimation of particular\nreligious interests. He was the object of polemical attacks by Marx\nand Engels in The Holy Family (1844) and The German\nIdeology (written in 1845\u201346). With his brother Edgar,\nBauer founded the Charlottenburg Democratic Society in 1848, and stood\nunsuccessfully for election to the Prussian National Assembly on a\nplatform of popular sovereignty.\n\nRemaining in Prussia after the defeats of 1848\u201349, Bauer\ncontinued to produce work of biblical criticism and political\nanalysis. He wrote in the mid 1850s for Die Zeit, a\ngovernment-sponsored newspaper, in which his anti-liberalism took a\nconservative turn. He contributed articles on European affairs to\nother newspapers, such as Die Post, the Kleines\nJournal, and the New York Daily Tribune. From\n1859\u201366 he collaborated with F.W.H. Wagener on his conservative\nStaats- und Gesellschafts-Lexikon, editing almost all 23\nvolumes, and writing numerous articles, several with anti-Semitic\nthemes. In 1865 he acquired a small farm in Rixdorf, on the outskirts\nof Berlin. He died there on 13 April 1882.\n",
