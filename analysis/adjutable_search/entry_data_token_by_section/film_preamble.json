    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe philosophy of film is now a firmly established subfield of\ncontemporary philosophy of art. Although philosophers were among the\nfirst academics to publish studies of the new artform in the early\ndecades of the twentieth century, the field did not experience\nsignificant growth until the 1980's when a renaissance occurred. There\nare many reasons for the field's recent growth. Suffice it to say here\nthat changes in both academic philosophy and the cultural role of the\nmovies in general made it imperative for philosophers to take film\nseriously as an artform on a par with the more traditional ones like\ntheater, dance, and painting. As a result of this surge in interest in\nfilm as a subject for philosophical reflection, the philosophy of film\nhas become an important area of research in aesthetics.\n\n\nThis entry is organized around a number of issues that are central to\nthe philosophy of film. They explore different aspect of film as an\nartistic medium, illustrating the range of concerns addressed within\nthe philosophy of film.\n",
