    "main_text": "Reflections on Knowledge\n6. Reflections on Knowledge\n\nFive surviving fragments and roughly a dozen testimonia\naddress what might be termed \u2018epistemological\nquestions\u2019\u2014\u201cHow much can any mortal being hope to\nknow?\u201d, \u201cDoes truth come to us through our own efforts or\nby divine revelation?\u201d, and \u201cWhat role do our sense\nfaculties play in the acquisition of knowledge?\u201d Unfortunately,\nthe picture that emerges from many of the testimonia largely\ncontradicts what appear to be the views Xenophanes himself expressed.\nAccording to the summary in the pseudo-Plutarch Miscellanies,\nXenophanes \u201cdeclares that the senses are deceptive and generally\nrejects reason along with them\u201d (A32.) Similarly, in his\nConcerning Philosophy Aristocles reports that\n\u201c\u2026since they think that sense perceptions and appearances\nmust be rejected and trust only reason. For at one earlier time\nXenophanes, Parmenides, Zeno, and Melissus said something of this\nsort\u201d (A49). Similarly, A\u00ebtius declares that\n\u201cPythagoras, Empedocles, and Xenophanes (say that) sense\nperceptions are deceptive\u201d (A49). Yet, as we have noted, B28\nrefers without qualification to \u201cthe upper limit of the earth\nthat is seen (horatai) here at our feet\u201d and B32\nappears to encourage those in Xenophanes\u2019 audience to\n\u2018look at\u2019 or \u2018observe\u2019 (idesthai) the\nmulti-colored cloud that is the rainbow. The realistic description of\nthe sumptuous banquet in B1 and the wide range of Xenophanes\u2019\nreported geographical and geological interests all sit poorly with an\nEleatic \u201crationalism\u201d that would dismiss all information\ngained through our faculties of sense and construct on the basis of\nreason alone a view of \u201cwhat is\u201d as a motionless,\nchangeless and eternal unity.\n\nXenophanes\u2019 most extended comment on knowledge is B34:\n\n\u2026and of course the clear and certain truth no man has seen\n\nnor will there be anyone who knows about the gods and what I say about\nall things.\n\nFor even if, in the best case, one happened to speak just of what has\nbeen brought to pass,\n\nstill he himself would not know. But opinion is allotted to all.\n\n\nPortions of these remarks were quoted, and thereby preserved for\nposterity, by the ancient skeptics who hailed Xenophanes as the\nfounder of their particular variety of philosophical skepticism.\nRecent interpretations of B34 reject the skeptical interpretation in\nfavor of other less extreme readings. On some accounts, B34 is\nconcerned to deny only a direct perceptual awareness. Others find in\nhis comments a distinction between natural science, where only\nprobabilities can be achieved, and theology, where certainty is\npossible. Still others read Xenophanes\u2019 remarks as a blanket\nendorsement of \u201cfallibilism\u201d\u2014the view that while\neach individual is free to express his or her opinion, the possibility\nof error can never be completely excluded.\n\nSince B34 opens with the phrase \u201cand indeed\u2026\u201d it is\nlikely that we do not have the whole of the remark, or all the\npremises from which its main conclusion was intended to follow.\nHowever, the use of the term saphes (\u201cclear\u201d, in\nthe first line of the fragment) by Xenophanes\u2019 Ionian\ncontemporary, the historian Herodotus, provides a helpful clue to the\nlogic of the argument. At several points in his History\nHerodotus speaks of what is saphes, or what can be known in a\nsaphe\u00f4s manner, as what can be confirmed to be the case\non the basis of first-hand observation:\n\nAnd wishing to gain sure knowledge of these things (thel\u00f4n\nde tout\u00f4n peri saphes ti eidenai) from a point where this\nwas possible, I took ship to Tyre in Phoenicia, where I heard there\nwas a very holy temple of Heracles. There I saw it (eidon)\nrichly equipped\u2026 Then I went to Thasos where I also found a\ntemple of Heracles\u2026Therefore what I have discovered by inquiry\nclearly shows (ta men nun histor\u00eamena d\u00ealoi\nsaphe\u00f4s) that Heracles is an ancient god. (History\nII, 44)\n\n\nSince the gods were believed to inhabit a realm far removed from that\nof mortal beings, it would be natural for Xenophanes to hold that no\naccount of their nature and activities could possibly be confirmed on\nthe basis of first-hand observation, hence known for certain to be\ncorrect. And since the pioneering cosmological accounts put forward by\nhis Milesian predecessors held that a single material substance\nunderlay phenomena in all places and times it would be\nequally impossible for any individual to confirm such a universal\nclaim on the basis of first-hand observation, hence know for certain\nthat it was true\u2014even if in fact it was true. The sentiments\nexpressed in lines three and four can be read as reinforcing this\ncautionary sentiment. Their point would be that no one (moreover)\nshould be credited with knowledge (of the certain truth concerning the\ngods or the nature of all things) simply on the basis of having\ncorrectly described, perhaps even predicted, individual events as they\ntake place (perhaps a reference to self-styled paragons of wisdom and\npredictors of events such as Epimenides and Pythagoras). The overall\nmessage of B34, from its opening reference to \u201cno man\u201d to\nits concluding phrase \u201cfashioned for all\u201d would have been\nthat there never has been nor ever will be anyone who has the capacity\nto achieve certainty with respect to these important matters.\n\nXenophanes\u2019 reference to a second-best level of comprehension or\nawareness\u2014\u2018opinion\u2019 or \u2018conjecture\u2019\n(dokos) should not be read as inherently negative or\ndismissive. By Platonic standards, opinion\u2014even when\ncorrect\u2014would be an inferior possession, unstable and subject to\nremoval through persuasion. But we have no reason to assume that\nXenophanes shared Plato\u2019s view on this topic. And in fact B35,\nquoted by Plutarch in connection with encouraging a bashful speaker to\nexpress his views, appears to present what one \u2018opines\u2019 or\nbelieves in a fairly positive light:\n\n\u2026Let these things be believed (dedoxasth\u00f4) as\nlike the realities\u2026\n\n\nThe similarity between the verbal dedoxasth\u00f4 of B35 and\nthe nominative dokos of B34 permits us to combine the two\nfragmentary remarks into a single coherent view: of course there can\nbe no knowledge of the certain truth concerning the gods and the basic\nprinciples governing the cosmos, but dokos\u2014opinion or\nconjecture\u2014is available and should be accepted when it\ncorresponds with how things really are.\n\nThe full sense of B36, however, may never be determined. Neither its\ncontext (a grammatical treatise of Herodian) nor its wording\n(\u201c\u2026however many they have made evident for mortals to\nlook upon\u201d) provides definitive guidance. Perhaps Xenophanes was\nseeking to set an upper limit to the range of things that can be known\nby human beings (i.e. to caution others that they could know only as\nmany as things as the gods had made available to them to experience).\nBut it is equally possible that the remark was intended (as B32 above)\nto encourage the members of his audience to explore and inquire on\ntheir own (i.e. to encourage them to investigate \u201chowever many\nthings\u201d the gods have made available to them to experience).\n\nB18 has often been hailed as an expression of an optimistic outlook or\n\u201cfaith in human progress\u201d\u2014the conviction that\nhumankind has made and will continue to make improvements in the arts\nand conditions of life generally. Yet none of the other surviving\nfragments reflects such an optimism and several (e.g. B2 and 3)\nsuggest that Xenophanes was not at all optimistic about his\ncity\u2019s prospects for survival. In the light of his reported\nrepudiation of divination (A52), de-mythologizing of various natural\nphenomena (B30 and 32), and evident enthusiasm for inquiry into a wide\nrange of subjects, B18 is perhaps best read as an expression of faith\nin the value of \u2018inquiry\u2019 or \u2018seeking\u2019 as the\npreferred approach to gaining knowledge of \u2018all\nthings\u2019.\n\nTo sum up: Xenophanes\u2019 attitude toward knowledge appears to have\nbeen the product of two distinct impulses. While he believed that\ninquiry in the form of travel and direct observation was capable of\nyielding useful information about the nature of things, he remained\nsufficiently under the influence of an older piety to want to caution\nothers against seeking to understand matters that lay beyond the\nlimits of all human experience. Here, as in other aspects of his\nthought, Xenophanes stands with one foot in the world of the archaic\npoet and the other in the \u201cnew science\u201d of the late 6th\nand early 5th centuries BCE\n",
