    "main_text": "The convergence argument\n5. The convergence argument\n\nBefore turning to problems for contractualism, we first address a\nchallenge to its distinctiveness. In On What Matters, Derek\nParfit argues that rule consequentialism, contractualism, and the best\ninterpretation of Kant\u2019s moral theory all coincide. The result\nis a triple theory, according to which \u201can act is wrong just\nwhen such acts are disallowed by some principle that is optimific,\nuniquely universally willable, and not reasonably rejectable\u201d\n(Parfit 2011, volume 1, p. 413). As contractualism presents itself as\nan alternative to both consequentialism and Kant, this would be a very\nsignificant result.\n\nThe convergence argument explicitly deals, not with Scanlon\u2019s\nown theory, but with \u201cwhat I believe to be the best version of\nScanlonian contractualism\u201d (Parfit 2011, volume 1, p. 412).\nParfit defends two key \u2018improvements\u2019, by rejecting two\nrestrictions that Scanlon places on the reasons that can be offered\nfor rejecting a moral principle, namely:\n\n\u201cIndividualist Restriction: In rejecting some moral\nprinciple, we must appeal to this principle\u2019s implications only\nfor ourselves and for other single people\u201d (Parfit\n2011, volume 2, p. 193). Or, in Scanlon\u2019s own words: \u201cthe\njustifiability of a moral principle depends only on individuals\u2019\nreasons for objecting to that principle and alternatives to it\u201d\n(Scanlon 1999, p. 229).\n\u201cImpersonalist Restriction: In rejecting some moral\nprinciple, we cannot appeal to claims about the impersonal goodness or\nbadness of outcomes\u201d (Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 214). Or, in\nScanlon\u2019s own words: \u201cimpersonal values are not themselves\ngrounds for reasonable rejection\u201d (Scanlon 1999, p. 222).\n\n\nIn other words, the convergence argument replaces Scanlon\u2019s\noriginal formulation of contractualism, where all reasons for\nrejection must be the personal complaints of specific individuals,\nwith a more impersonal version.\n\nIn\n section 2,\n we noted a number of differences between Kantian and Scanlonian\ncontractualism. Despite these differences, Parfit argues that\nScanlonian contractualism coincides with the best interpretation of\nKant. In a cumulative argument spread over several chapters, Parfit\nargues that the best interpretation of Kant\u2019s moral ideas yields\nthe following claim:\n\nKantian rule consequentialism: Everyone ought to follow the optimific\nprinciples, because these are the only principles that everyone could\nrationally will to be universal laws. (Parfit 2011, volume 1, p. 411)\n\n\nEven if we accept the convergence of Kant and rule consequentialism,\nit still remains to be shown that these optimific and uniquely\nuniversally willable principles are the only set of principles that\nno-one could reasonably reject. The key step in this second prong of\nthe convergence argument is the claim that \u201cwhen there is only\none relevant principle that everyone could rationally choose, no\none\u2019s objection to this principle could be as strong as the\nstrongest objection to every alternative\u201d (Parfit 2011, volume\n2, p. 245).\n\nThis key claim seems open to obvious counter-examples\u2014cases\nwhere contractualism seems to diverge from rule consequentialism. Most\nstriking are those cases where \u201cwe can either save one person\nfrom some great burden, or give much smaller benefits to many other\npeople, who are all much better-off\u201d (Parfit 2011, volume 2, p.\n246). \n\nProponents of the convergence argument must somehow explain away these\napparent counter-examples. Following Parfit, they will first will\ndivide such cases into two classes. In some cases, the optimific rule\nconsequentialist principles instruct us to favour the individual.\nConsider Scanlon\u2019s own example where we must choose between\nelectrifying an innocent person and disrupting millions of\npeople\u2019s enjoyment of a televised sporting event (Scanlon 1998,\np. 235). Here, many rule consequentialists will argue that the\noptimific rules do instruct us to save the innocent person. If so, the\nconvergence between rule consequentialism and contractualism is\nstraightforward. In its contest with rule consequentialism,\ncontractualism cannot draw its intuitive appeal from such cases.\n\nWe must turn, then, to those cases where the optimific rule\nconsequentialist principles do instruct us to provide the smaller\nbenefits to many others. Here, the convergence argument must deny that\nthe solitary individual can reasonably reject the optimific\nprinciples. This is where Parfit\u2019s \u2018improvements\u2019 on\ncontractualism are vital to the convergence argument. As originally\nformulated, contractualism departs from utilitarianism by allowing the\nindividual to reject the optimific principles whenever they place a\ngreater burden on her than her favoured principle places on\nany other single individual. Proponents of the convergence argument\nwill favour instead a more impersonal formulation. While the\nindividual\u2019s own complaint is left undiminished, other people\ncan now reject her principle on impersonal\ngrounds\u2014precisely because it fails to maximise everyone\u2019s\nwell-being. Faced with these impersonal reasons, the single individual\ncannot reasonably reject the optimific principles.\n\nDespite its provocative claims, the convergence argument is, in one\nrespect, quite modest. It does not set out to prove that rule\nconsequentialism, Kantian ethics and contractualism necessarily\ncoincide. Rather, the conclusion is merely that plausible versions of\nthe three theories do not necessarily conflict. For this\nmodest purpose, it would be sufficient to construct one plausible\nversion of contractualism on which the optimific principles cannot\nreasonably be rejected.\n\nThere is a methodological issue here. In his presentation of the\nconvergence argument, Parfit tests competing versions of\ncontractualism against intuitions regarding specific idealised cases.\nThis is not a peculiarity of Parfit\u2019s own presentation. Without\nintuitions of this kind, the convergence argument cannot get off the\nground. Proponents of individualist formulations of contractualism\nmight reply that, in some key cases, Parfit\u2019s intuitions are not\nneutral benchmarks, but rather reflect the considered moral judgements\nof a consequentialist mind. This leaves it open to Contractualists to\nsimply stick to their guns\u2014and argue that their view is\ndistinctive at the normative level, as well as the meta-ethical\nlevel.\n\nCommenting on Parfit\u2019s earlier claim that the best\ninterpretation of Kant coincides with the best form of rule\nconsequentialism, Scanlon observes that \u201cthe degree to which\nParfit\u2019s conclusion should seem surprising depends to a certain\nextent on how close the theories he is discussing are to\nKant\u2019s\u201d (Scanlon 2011, p. 117). Similar remarks apply to\nthe convergence argument. The appeal of contractualism is that it\npresents a genuine alternative to both consequentialism and Kantian\nethics. Those who are attracted to contractualism because, in certain\nkey cases, it coheres with distinctively non-utilitarian intuitions,\nare likely to regard the impersonal contractualism deployed in the\nconvergence argument as an abandonment of the core commitments of\ncontractualism. The convergence argument would then be of limited\nrelevance. We return to these issues below, when we consider the\nIndividual and Impersonal Restrictions in more detail. (See sections\n 8,\n 9, and\n 13.)\n\nParfit\u2019s convergence argument has not attracted as much\nattention as other aspects of either his work or Scanlon\u2019s. (One\nexception is Kumar 2011.) However, the general issue of the\nrelationship between contractualism and consequentialism is very\nrelevant to a number of objections to contractualism. It is always\nworth arking whether contractualism can cope adequately with new\nchallenges (such as aggregation, substantive responsibility, risk, or\nfuture people) without collapsing into rule consequentialism.\n",
