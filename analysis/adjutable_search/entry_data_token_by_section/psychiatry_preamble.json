    "main_text": "\n\n\nPhilosophical discussions of mental illness fall into three\nfamilies. First, there are topics that arise when we treat psychiatry\nas a special science and deal with it using the methods and concepts of\nphilosophy of science. This includes discussion of such issues as\nexplanation, reduction and classification. Second, there are conceptual\nissues that arise when we try to understand the very idea of mental\nillness and its ethical and experiential dimensions. Third, there are\ninteractions between psychopathology and the philosophy of mind;\nphilosophers have used clinical phenomena to illuminate issues in the\nphilosophy of mind, and philosophical findings to try to understand\nmental illness. This entry will discuss issues in the philosophy of\nscience and philosophy of mind that pertain to psychiatry.\n",
