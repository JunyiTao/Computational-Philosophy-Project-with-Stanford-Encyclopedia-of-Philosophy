    "main_text": "Epistemology: Demonstration, Scientific Method, Human Knowledge || Levels of Epistemic Certainty\n3.3 Levels of Epistemic Certainty\nGalen is committed to the possibility of secure knowledge of the physical world. In The Best Teaching (Opt. Doc.), in response to contemporary Greek epistemological debates and in particular to Academic Skepticism, he rejects arguments that encourage us to doubt one\u2019s natural evaluative faculty (krit\u0113rion), or to advance arguments on both sides of any proposition in order to reach suspension of judgement; he also attacks the Stoic terminology of the \u201capprehensive\u201d or \u201ckataleptic\u201d (katal\u0113ptik\u0113) impression, a kind of cognitive experience which is so clear as to be self-guaranteeing. (But he seems to regard the distinction between \u201ckataleptic\u201d and his preferred term, \u201csecurely knowable\u201d, as purely verbal, rather than of philosophical interest. Relatedly, he mentions, but does not seem to feel a serious philosophical challenge from, the Skeptical objection that one may believe one has a reliable perception also in dreams or in mentally deranged states.)\nGalen is exercised to assert the reliability of one\u2019s fundamental intuitions and sense-perceptions (what is trustworthy in itself, ex heautou pista), on the one hand, while giving an explanation of human disagreement on matters of fact and theory, on the other. His view is that while we are endowed with a naturally reliable evaluative faculty (krit\u0113rion), there is a right and a wrong way of training this; the former will, in particular, enable one to distinguish true from false arguments. (Training of the individual faculties of sense perception\u2014for example, touch\u2014is also of great importance, especially for the aspiring doctor.) Galen uses an analogy with other specialist skills (technai): a music teacher or gymnastic trainer, equally, relies on the pupil\u2019s trust in his own natural krit\u0113rion, but this does not mean that performance will be error-free. Rather, teaching in these contexts\u2014as in that of logical argument and knowledge acquisition\u2014is a constant process of supervision and correction of errors.\nGalen also theorizes in an original way the relationship between empirical inputs and the conceptual framework within which they are assessed; in particular, with his concept of \u201cqualified experience\u201d (di\u014drismen\u0113 peira; see van der Eijk 1997; Hankinson 2021; Singer 2021b) he asserts that empirical data can only lead to the truth in the context of a theoretical framework arrived at through reason.\nWe have considered the role of logical demonstration. We should consider further the role of mathematics and geometry: Galen looks to these as providing a model of the possibility of certain knowledge, and a refutation of Skepticism. He recommends a training in these disciplines, where \u201cthe fact itself bears witness of its truth, once discovered\u201d\u2014i.e., where one cannot doubt the rightness of the solution one has reached\u2014for anyone interested in truth-giving enquiry (Aff. Pecc. Dig. II.3, 290\u20132; II.4\u20135, 299\u2013305). A paradigmatic case is that of the construction of a sundial: if one has done it correctly, the facts themselves confirm that. That is, one can simply observe that the sun hits the first line at daybreak and the last at sunset; moreover, the correctness of the positioning of the remaining lines can be checked against a simply constructed water clock.\nSo, Galen is optimistic about the attainability of reliable knowledge. Yet the examples of mathematics and geometry at the same time point to the most obvious challenge to this epistemological optimism. For, surely, the gulf between the level of certainty available in those areas and that possible in the study of the biological world, let alone in the medical examination of individual cases, is an enormous one.\nYet Galen seems remarkably confident about the possibility of secure knowledge, even in areas where he is able to produce little that looks like a \u201cdemonstration\u201d: to the above case of element theory we might add, for example, the confident classification of pathological states and their signs or, indeed, the quantificatory account of drugs and their dosages in the pharmacological work. In all such cases, Galen seems convinced, a method proceeding from reliable empirical starting-points and applying sound logical method (and where relevant training the perceptual senses) may lead to secure knowledge; see van der Eijk 2015; Singer 2021b.\nOn the other hand, in clinical practice we make the transition from propositions of universal validity\u2014the sort which Galen believes himself able to arrive at in the way seen above, through the application of logical method on the basis of evident starting-points\u2014to the particular case; and Galen problematizes this difference between the general or universal (katholou) and the individual or particular (idion) (Chiaradonna 2013, van der Eijk 2008). Each individual case is different; moreover, the existence is acknowledged of empirical experiences which are not expressible in words (Dig. Puls. III.3, 914). This suggests a conclusion of considerable epistemological interest, namely that there are individual phenomena which cannot be fully incorporated in the universal scientific account (see Singer 2021b).\nCentral to the understanding of clinical practice, too, is that we are here dealing with a system of symptoms or signs; and inference from signs cannot give one the same kind of secure knowledge that is available for propositions arrived at through demonstration. Galen here engages in what was already a complex and sophisticated area of discussion, drawing on both Hippocratic texts (see the discussion of signs in his commentary on the Hippocratic Prognosticon) and debates in Hellenistic philosophy and medicine (Allen 2001, Hankinson 2008a, van der Eijk 2008). As we have seen Galen, unlike the Empiricists, believes that the observation of bodily signs\u2014a complex range, for the ancient doctor\u2014enables the expert to make inferences about the underlying bodily state and causal conditions. The term endeixis here refers to the \u201cindication\u201d that the observed body gives, both of what has caused its present state, and of the appropriate treatment.\nGalen remains confident about epistemic success in this area too; yet it is important to make the appropriate distinctions in relation to certainty and demonstrability.\n",
