Contemporary Expressions\n\nAlthough recent developments of panentheism tend to continue the\nGerman Idealist tradition or the tradition of process philosophy,\ncontemporary panentheism demonstrates great diversity (see Michael\nBrierley 2004, 3). Many of these contemporary expressions of\npanentheism involve scientists and protestant theologians or\nphilosophers. But, articulations of forms of panentheism have also\ndeveloped among feminists, in the Roman Catholic tradition, in the\nOrthodox tradition, and in religions other than Christianity.\n\nUtilizing resources from the tradition of German Idealism, J\u00fcrgen\nMoltmann developed a form of panentheism in his early work, The\nCrucified God in 1974 (1972 for the German original), where he\nsaid that the suffering and renewal of all humanity are taken into the\nlife of the Triune God. He explicated his understanding of panentheism\nmore fully in The Trinity and the Kingdom in 1981.\nTheological concerns motivate Moltmann\u2019s concept of panentheism.\nPanentheism avoids the arbitrary concept of creation held by classical\ntheism and the loss of creaturely freedom that occurs in Christian\npantheism (J. Cooper 2006, 248). The relationship between God and the\nworld is like the relationship among the members of the Trinity in\nthat it involves relationships and communities (Molnar 1990, 674).\nMoltmann uses the concept of perichoresis to describe this\nrelationship of mutual interpenetration. By using the concept of\nperichoresis, Moltmann moves away from a Hegelian understanding of the\ntrinity as a dialectical development in history (J. Cooper 2006, 251).\nThe relationship between God and the world develops because of\nGod\u2019s nature as love that seeks the other and the free response\nof the other (Molnar 1990, 677). Moltmann does not consider creation\nnecessary for God nor the result of any inner divine compulsion.\nInstead, creation is the result of God\u2019s essential activity as\nlove rather than the result of God\u2019s self-determination (Molnar\n1990, 679). This creation occurs in a process of interaction between\nnothingness and creativity, contraction and expansion, in God. Because\nthere is no \u201coutside\u201d of God due to God\u2019s infinity,\nGod must withdraw in order for creation to exist. Kenosis, or\nGod\u2019s self-emptying, occurs in creation as well as in the\nincarnation. The nothing in the doctrine of \u201ccreation from\nnothing\u201d is the primordial result of God\u2019s contraction of\nGod\u2019s essential infinity (J. Cooper 2006, 247). Moltmann finds\nthat panentheism as mutual interpenetration preserves unity and\ndifference in a variety of differences in kind such as God and human\nbeing, person and nature, and the spiritual and the sensuous (Moltmann\n1996, 307).\n\nIn his process panentheism, David Ray Griffin assumes that scientific\nunderstandings of the world are crucial and recognizes the\nimplications of scientific understanding for theology. However, his\nconcept of panentheism builds on the principles of process philosophy\nrather than scientific concepts directly. Griffin traces modern\natheism to the combination of understanding perception as exclusively\nbased on physical sensations, accepting a naturalistic explanation of\nreality, and identifying matter as the only reality. But, the\nemergence of mind challenges the adequacy of this contemporary\nworldview (2004, 40\u201341). He claims that the supernaturalistic\nform of theism with its emphasis upon the divine will does not provide\nan adequate alternative to the atheism of the late modern worldview\nbecause God becomes the source of evil. Griffin argues that\nsupernaturalistic theism makes God the source of evil because\nGod\u2019s will establishes the general principles of the universe\n(2004, 37). Process panentheism provides a way to avoid the problems\nof both materialistic naturalism and classical theism (2004, 42).\nGriffin\u2019s panexperientialism bases sensory perception on a\nnon-sensory mode of perception in order to explain both the mind-body\ninteraction and the God-world interaction. God and the world are\ndifferent entities but both are actual. They are numerically distinct\nbut ontologically the same, in Griffin\u2019s terms, avoiding dualism\nand supernaturalism. God and events in the world interact through\nnon-sensory perception (2004, 44\u201345). Through this interaction,\nGod can influence but not determine the world, and the world can\ninfluence God\u2019s concrete states without changing God\u2019s\nessence. Process panentheism recognizes two aspects of the divine, an\nabstract and unchanging essence and a concrete state that involves\nchange. Through this dipolar concept, God both influences and is\ninfluenced by the world (2004, 43\u201344). Griffin understands God\nas essentially the soul of the universe although distinct from the\nworld. The idea of God as the soul of the world stresses the intimacy\nand direct nature of God\u2019s relationship to the world, not the\nemergence of the soul from the world (2004, 44). Relationality is part\nof the divine essence, but this does not mean that this specific world\nis necessary to God. This world came into existence from relative\nnothingness. This relative nothingness was a chaos that lacked any\nindividual that sustained specific characteristics over time. However,\neven in the chaos prior to the creation of this world, events had some\ndegree of self-determination and causal influence upon subsequent\nevents. These fundamental causal principles along with God exist\nnaturally since these causal principles are inherent in things that\nexist including the nature of God. The principles cannot be broken\nbecause such an interruption would be a violation of God\u2019s\nnature. An important implication of the two basic causal principles, a\ndegree of self-determination and causal influence, is that God\ninfluences but does not determine other events (2004, 43).\nGriffin\u2019s understanding of naturalism allows for divine action\nthat is formally the same in all events. But this divine action can\noccur in a variable manner so that some acts are especially revelatory\nof the divine character and purpose (2004, 45).\n\nThe context of the science and religion discussion responds to the\nearly modern concept of an unchanging natural order which posed a\nchallenge to understandings of divine action in the world. The current\ndiscussion draws on the development of scientific information about\nthe natural world that can contribute to religious efforts to explain\nhow God acts in the world. Arthur Peacocke and Paul Davies have made\nimportant contributions as scientists. Peacocke developed his\nunderstanding of panentheism beginning in 1979 and continuing through\nworks in 2001, 2004, and 2006. Peacocke starts with the shift in the\nscientific understanding of the world from a mechanism to the current\nunderstandings of the world as a unity composed of complex systems in\na hierarchy of different levels. These emergent levels do not become\ndifferent types of reality but instead compose a unity that can be\nunderstood naturally as an emergentist monism. At the same time, the\ndifferent levels of complexity cannot be reduced to an explanation of\none type or level of complexity. The creative dynamic of the emergence\nof complexity in hierarchies is immanent in the world rather than\nexternal to the world (Peacocke 2004, 137\u2013142). Similarly, Paul\nDavies describes the universe by talking about complexity and higher\nlevels of organization in which participant observers bring about a\nmore precise order (2007). An important scientific aspect of this\nconcept of complexity and organization is the notion of entanglement\nespecially conceptual level entanglement (Davies 2006, 45\u201348).\nAgain, the organization, which makes life possible, is an internal, or\nnatural, order rather than an order imposed from outside of the\nuniverse (Davies 2004). Peacocke draws upon this contemporary\nscientific understanding of the universe to think about the\nrelationship between God and the natural world. He rejects any\nunderstanding of God as external to nature whether it is a theistic\nunderstanding where God intervenes in the natural world or a deistic\nunderstanding where God initiates the natural world but does not\ncontinue to be active in the world. For Peacocke, God continuously\ncreates through the processes of the natural order. God\u2019s active\ninvolvement is not an additional, external influence upon events.\nHowever, God is not identified with the natural processes, which are\nthe action of God as Creator (Peacocke 2004, 143\u2013144). Peacocke\nidentifies his understanding of God\u2019s relation to the world as\npanentheism because of its rejection of external interactions by God\nin favor of God always working from inside the universe. At the same\ntime, God transcends the universe because God is more than the\nuniverse in the sense of God being unlimited by the world. This\npanentheistic model combines a stronger emphasis upon God\u2019s\nimmanence with God\u2019s ultimate transcendence over the universe by\nusing a model of personal agency (Peacocke 2004, 147\u2013151).\nDavies also refers to his understanding of the role of laws in nature\nas panentheism rather than deism because God chose laws that give a\nco-creative role to nature (2004, 104).\n\nPhilip Clayton begins with contemporary scientific understandings of\nthe world and combines them with theological concepts drawn from a\nvariety of sources including process theology. He describes\nGod\u2019s relationship with the world as an internal rather than an\nexternal relationship. Understanding God\u2019s relationship as\ninternal to the world recognizes the validity of modern scientific\nunderstandings that do not require any external source in order to\naccount for the order in the world. At the same time, God\u2019s\ninternal presence provides the order and regularity that the world\nmanifests (2001, 208\u2013210). Clayton agrees that the world is in\nGod and God is in the world. Panentheism, according to him, affirms\nthe interdependence of God and the world (2004a, 83). This affirmation\nbecame possible as a result of the rejection of substantialistic\nlanguage in favor of personal language in thinking of God.\nSubstantialistic language excludes all other actualities from any one\nactuality. Rejection of substantialistic language thus allows for the\ninteraction of beings. Clayton cites Hegel\u2019s recognition that\nthe logic of the infinite requires the inclusion of the finite in the\ninfinite and points towards the presence of the world in God (Clayton\n2004a, 78\u201379). Clayton, along with Joseph Bracken (1995),\nidentifies panentheism as Trinitarian and kenotic (Clayton 2005, 255).\nIt is Trinitarian because the world participates in God in a manner\nanalogous to the way that members of the Trinity participate in each\nother although the world is not and does not become God. God freely\ndecides to limit God\u2019s infinite power in an act of kenosis in\norder to allow for the existence of non-divine reality. The divine\nkenotic decision results in the actuality of the world that is taken\ninto God. But, for Clayton, God\u2019s inclusion of finite being as\nactual is contingent upon God\u2019s decision rather than necessary\nto God\u2019s essence (2003, 214). Clayton affirms creation from\nnothing as a description of creaturely existence prior to God\u2019s\ndecision. The involvement of the world in an internal relationship\nwith God does not completely constitute the divine being for Clayton.\nInstead, God is both primordial, or eternal, and responsive to the\nworld. The world does constitute God\u2019s relational aspect but not\nthe totality of God (2005, 250\u2013254). The best way to describe\nthe interdependence between God and the world for Clayton is through\nthe concept of emergence. Emergence may be explanatory,\nepistemological, or ontological. Ontological understandings of\nemergence, which Clayton supports, hold (1) monism but not\nphysicalism, (2) properties emerge in objects from the potentiality of\nan object that cannot be previously identified in the object\u2019s\nparts or structure, (3) the emergence of new properties giving rise to\ndistinct levels of causal relations, and (4) downward causation of the\nemergent level upon prior levels (2006a, 2\u20134). Emergence\nrecognizes that change is important to the nature of the world and\nchallenges views of God as unchanging (Clayton 2006b, 320).\n\nA number of feminists advocate panentheism by critiquing traditional\nunderstandings of transcendence for continuing dualistic ways of\nthinking. Feminist panentheists conceive of the divine as continuous\nwith the world rather than being ontologically transcendent over the\nworld (Frankenberry 2011). Sallie McFague\u2019s use of metaphors in\nboth theology and science led her to describe the world as God\u2019s\nbody. McFague bases the metaphorical nature of all statements about\nGod upon panentheism (2001, 30). Furthermore, for McFague, panentheism\nsees the world as in God which gives priority to God\u2019s name but\nincludes each person\u2019s name and preserves their distinctiveness\nin the divine reality (2001, 5). God\u2019s glory becomes manifest in\nGod\u2019s total self-giving to the world so that transcendence\nbecomes immanence rather than being understood as God\u2019s power\nmanifest in distant control of the world. Grace Jantzen also uses the\nmetaphor of the world as God\u2019s body. Additionally, Jantzen\n(1998) and Gloria Schaab (2007) have proposed metaphors about the womb\nand midwifery to describe God\u2019s relation to the world. Anna\nCase-Winters challenges McFague\u2019s metaphor of the world as\nGod\u2019s body. Case-Winters acknowledges that this metaphor\nmaintains God\u2019s personal nature, offers a coherent way to talk\nabout God\u2019s knowledge of and action in the world, recognizes\nGod\u2019s vulnerable suffering love, and revalues nature and\nembodiment. But at least McFague\u2019s early use of the\nworld-as-God\u2019s-body metaphor tended towards pantheism and even\nher later introduction of an agential role for the divine still\nretains the possibility of the loss of the identity of the world.\nCase-Winters uses Jay McDaniel\u2019s (1989) distinction between\nemanational, arising out of the being of the One, and relational,\npresent through relationship, understandings of God\u2019s immanence\nin the world to establish a form of panentheism with a clearer\ndistinction between God and the world. The world is an\n\u201cother\u201d in relation to God rather than being a direct\nexpression of God\u2019s own being through emanation for Case-Winters\n(30\u201332). Nancy Frankenberry contrasts McFague\u2019s and\nCase-Winter\u2019s two concepts of transcendence to the traditional\nhierarchical concept of transcendence. McFague\u2019s concept is one\nof total immanence while Case-Winters holds a dialectic between\nindividual transcendence and immanence (2011).\n\nAlthough much of the development of panentheism takes place in the\ncontext of the Christian tradition, connections between other world\nreligions and panentheism have been identified. These connections\nrange from explicitly panentheistic traditions, to similarities to\nspecific beliefs and practices of a tradition, to beliefs and\npractices that could be developed into panentheistic positions.\nHartshorne in his discussion of panentheism included a section on\nHinduism (1953). Lorilai Biernacki considers Hinduism to be one of the\nmost panentheistic traditions (Biernacki 2014b). The concept of the\nworld as the body of the divine offers a strong similarity to Western\npanentheism. The Gita identifies the whole world, including\nall the gods and living creatures, as the Divine body. But the Divine\nBeing has its own body that contains the world while being more than\nthe world. While the Upanishads acknowledge the body of the Divine at\ntimes, the body of the divine is never identified as the cosmos. Most\nof the Tantrics hold a pantheistic view in which the practitioner is a\nmanifestation of the divine. Abhinavagupta, in the tenth century,\nprovided the first panentheistic understanding of the world as\nGod\u2019s body. For him, differentiation is Shiva concealing his\nwholeness. Abhinavagupta also insisted that Shiva transcends the\ncosmos (Bilimoria and Stansell 2010, 244\u2013258; Clayton 2010,\n187\u2013189; and Barua 2010, 1\u201330. See also Hardy 2016;\nSilberstein 2017; and Stavig 2017). Other traditions where connections\nto panentheism have been found include Judaism (Artson 2014 and\nLangton 2016), Jainism (Chapple 2014), Confucianism (Lee 2014),\nBuddhism (Samuel 2014), and Sufism (Sharify-Funk and Dickson 2014).\nWhile these connections might imply a universalistic theology,\npanentheism affirms the importance of all religions and supports\ninter-religions dialogue (Biernacki 2014a, 6, 10).\n4. The Nature of the God/world Relation\n\nThe God/world relation plays a crucial role in the variety of\nexpressions of panentheism. Using metaphors to describe the\nrelationship between God and the world has been controversial. McFague\nargues that any attempt to do theology requires the use of metaphor\n(2001, 30) and for Peacocke the limitation of language requires the\nuse of models and metaphors in describing both God and the cosmos\n(Schaab 2008, 13). The primary objection to the dominant metaphor in\npanentheism of the world as God\u2019s body is the substantialistic\nimplications of the term \u201cbody\u201d that lead either to an\nontological separation between the world and God or to a loss of\nidentity for God or the world. Bracken finds that the soul\u2013body\nmetaphor lacks clarity about the freedom and self-identity of the\ncreatures in relations to God (1992, 211). Case-Winters faults the\nsoul\u2013body metaphor for tending to see the soul as dominating the\nbody and failing to recognize the world as a unified organism (1995,\n251, 254). Clayton proposes different levels of metaphor as the most\nadequate way to reconcile the conflict between divine action and the\nintegrity of the created realm (2003, 208).\n\nDescribing the God\u2013world relation by use of the term\n\u201cin\u201d lacks precision in understanding the ontological\nnature of the relation due to the variety of meanings of\n\u201cin\u201d. Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling used the phrase\n\u201cPan+en+theism\u201d in his \u201cEssay on Freedom\u201d in\n1809 where the \u201cen\u201d meant inherence as strong ontological\ndependence and referred to participation as a relation to the divine\n(Clayton 2008a, 169). Karl Krause (1781\u20131832) created the German\nterm translated as \u201cpanentheism\u201d seeking to overcome the\nsplit between humanity and nature that was expressed both in the\nsupernaturalist theism epitomized by Leibniz and the naturalism of\nSpinoza\u2019s pantheism (Gregersen 2004, 28). Metaphysical\nunderstandings of God\u2019s relation to the world have been proposed\nthat are more precise than metaphors or \u201cin\u201d.\nSchelling\u2019s German idealism understood God as freely unfolding\nemanation by introducing subjectivity. Emanation avoids ontological\nseparation between God and the world because the world participates in\nthe infinite as its source (Clayton 2000, 477\u2013481). Krause\nunderstood the world\u2019s participation in God both ontologically\nand epistemically. The particularity of each existent being depends\nupon the Absolute for its existence as what it is (G\u00f6cke 2013a,\n372). Keller offers another metaphysical understanding by arguing for\ncreation out of chaos. She rejects substance metaphysics and describes\nthe relation between God and the world as a complex relationality\ninvolving an active indeterminacy and past realities (2003, 219).\nFinally, the science and religion discussion provides another\nmetaphysical understanding by drawing upon scientific concepts of\nsupervenience, emergence, downward causation, and entanglement to\nprovide a ground for theological concepts of God\u2019s relation to\nthe world.\n\nThe nature of this mutual relationship between the infinite and the\nfinite basically depends upon the understanding of the ontology of\neach member of the relationship. The issue is the nature of being for\nGod and for the world as the basis for mutual influence between God\nand the world. A variety of attempts have sought to describe the\nnature of God\u2019s being and the world\u2019s being in their\nrelationship. Thomistic thought utilizes a concept of analogy as it\nwrestles with the nature of the being of God and the being of the\nworld (Malloy 2014). Others in considering God\u2019s action in the\nworld posit the necessity of ontological difference between God and\nfinite reality (M. Leidenhag 2014, 219). Process thought directly\naddresses the issue of ontology by calling for an ontology that does\nnot consider substance as the basic type of existence because\nsubstance does not allow for internal relations (Bracken 2014, 10).\nAccording to Wesley Wildman the relations between entities are\nontologically more fundamental than the entities themselves for\nrelational ontology in contrast to substantivist ontology where\nentities are ontologically primary and relations derivative (2010,\n55).\n\nHistorically, participation, Hegelian dynamic ontology, and process\ndynamic ontology have been utilized to describe the ontological basis\nfor the relations between God and the world. Participation has\nphilosophical antecedents in Plato and Aristotle and was utilized in\nAugustinian and Orthodox Christian traditions. In participation, the\nexistence of the world somehow takes part in God\u2019s being. Early\nmodern usage of the concept of participation appears in the thought of\nKrause (1781\u20131832) and Sergei Bulgakov (1871\u20131944). Krause\nidentifies the character of each thing as the result of its\nparticipation in the original unity of the Absolute. But the Absolute\nis still different from its parts in its internal constitution\n(G\u00f6cke 2013a, 372). Bulgakov describes participation as the\ninclusion of the finite by the Absolute (Gavrilyuk 2015, 453).\nHegelian dynamic ontology describes an Infinite which gives rise to\nthe finite through a dialectical process of negation. The finite\nthrough a second reciprocal negation of its finitude brings about\nunion and return in transformation to both the Infinite and the finite\n(Williams 2010, 143). Process dynamic ontology understands God as\ndipolar with a primordial nature that is eternal and a consequent\nnature that includes the actualizations achieved by the world. God\npresents possibilities to the events of the world which then make\ndecisions bringing about actualities that are then included in\nGod.\n\nBracken and Cazalis seek to make the ontological nature of the\nrelation more precise. Bracken proposes a Trinitarian field theory to\nexplain the world\u2019s presence in God. The world is a large but\nfinite field of activity within the all-comprehensive field of\nactivity constituted by the three divine persons in ongoing relations\nwith each other and with all the creation (2009, 159). Bracken\u2019s\nTrinitarian field theory draws on systems theory from science,\nWhitehead\u2019s concept of society, and Christian Trinitarian\ndoctrine. A society as a type of system is a group of entities with an\norganizing principle. Basically, reality is an all-encompassing\nsociety in which subsocieties operate in their own ways as distinct.\nGod functions as the regnant subsociety and receives the richness of\nthe information from the world of creation (Bracken 2014, 80). Bracken\nsummarizes this system understanding of panentheism in three\nconclusions: (1) systems are social rather than individual, can be\ncombined horizontally and vertically, change over time due to changes\nin constituents, and do not make decisions; (2) the three divine\npersons and all their creatures are together constituent members of an\nexpanded divine life-system; and (3) the relationships of the various\nlevels of societies involve both bottom-up causation and an objective\nformal top-down causation of the constraints of higher order systems\non lower order systems (2015a, 223). Although not as fully developed\nas Bracken\u2019s society explanation, Cazalis uses category theory\nand the concept of adjunction in order to offer an internal law that\ngives specificity to panentheism. In this approach relations go both\nways between two categories and the link carries the universal\nproperty from one element of a given category to another category\n(Cazalis 2016, 210).\n5. Criticisms and Responses\n\nPanentheism continues to develop. This growth has led to diverse forms\nof panentheism such as soteriological, revelational or expressivist,\nand dipolar (Gregersen 2004, 21). The variety of forms of panentheism\nhas also resulted in different degrees of panentheism ranging from\nexplicit fully developed panentheism to vague and underdeveloped forms\nof panentheism and to expressions of theism that share certain\nconcepts with fully developed forms of panentheism. Michael Brierley\nlists three premises as distinctive to panentheism: God is not\nseparate from the cosmos, God is affected by the cosmos, and God is\nmore than the cosmos (2006, 639\u2013640). Fully developed\npanentheism includes thinkers such as Charles Hartshorne, Phillip\nClayton, Leonardo Boff, Peter Hodgson, John Macquarrie, Sallie\nMcFague, J\u00fcrgen Moltmann, and Arthur Peacocke who have identified\nthemselves as panentheists. Other thinkers such as Paul Tillich have\nrarely self-identified as panentheists but share concepts with\npanentheism (Burch 1998, 251). And finally, especially through world\nreligions and early theologies various forms of theism offer diversity\nsharing certain concepts with panentheism.\n\nAnother impetus for development has been criticisms of panentheism.\nThese criticisms have taken two forms. One form, by major alternatives\nto panentheistic understandings of the God-world relation, has\ncriticized the adequacy of panentheism. Panentheism faces challenges\nboth from those who resist any lessening of the emphasis upon divine\ntranscendence and from those who find pantheism more adequate than any\nsystem distinguishing between God and the world. Recently, an\nimportant criticism, especially from Analytic theology, has been that\npanentheism lacks the distinctiveness needed to identify it precisely\nenough to distinguish it from other forms of theism, critique it, and\nfurther its development. Finally, the variety of the versions of\npanentheism has led to an active internal discussion among the various\nversions.\n\nCriticisms of panentheism from major alternatives such as pantheists\nand scientists working with naturalist assumptions criticize\npanentheism for its metaphysical claim that there is a being above or\nother than the natural world. At times, this criticism has been made\nby claiming that a thorough-going naturalism does not need a\ntranscendent, individualized reality. Robert Corrington describes the\ndevelopment of his thought as a growing awareness that panentheism\nunnecessarily introduces a being above nature as well as in nature\n(2002, 49). William Drees expresses a similar criticism by arguing\nthat all contemporary explanations of human agency, including\nnon-reductionist explanations, are naturalistic and do not require any\nreference to a higher being. For panentheists to claim that divine\nagency is analogous to human agency fails both to recognize that human\nagency requires no additional source or cause and to explain how a\ndivine source of being could act in the realm of physical and mental\nprocesses (1999). Frankenberry makes this objection more specific.\nPanentheism offers a more complex relationship between God and the\nworld than is necessary. This unnecessary complexity is revealed by\nthe problems that panentheism has with the logic of the freedom of\nparts in wholistic relations, the possibility of the body-soul analogy\nrelapsing into gender inflected ideas of the soul as the male\nprinciple, the problem with simultaneity of events in the divine\nexperience in relation to the principle of the relativity of time, the\nnecessity of the everlasting nature of value, and finally the use of\nthe ontological argument to establish the necessity of the abstract\npole of the divine nature (1993, 36\u201339). Carl Gillett points out\nthat panentheism lacks an explanation for a causal efficacy higher\nthan the causal efficacy realized by microphysical causation (2003,\n19). Generally, panentheists respond to these criticisms by claiming\nthe inadequacy both scientifically and metaphysically of any type of\nreductionistic naturalism. Such a naturalism whether articulated in\nscientific categories or religious categories fails to recognize the\nemergence of levels of complexity in nature. The emergence of higher\nlevels of organization that cannot be completely explained in terms of\nlower levels renders non-differentiated accounts of being inadequate.\nPanentheists often argue that the emergence of higher levels of order\nmakes possible downward causation. Davies describes the difficulties\nin coming to a clear description of downward causation and concludes\nthat the complexity of systems open to the environment makes room for\ndownward causation but has not yet provided an explanation of how\ndownward causation works (2006, 48). The concepts of entanglement and\ndivine entanglement may offer a new perspective on causation and\nespecially the role of the divine in natural causation (Wegter-McNelly\n2011).\n\nThe basic theological criticism of panentheism is that its concept of\nGod is inadequate. J. Cooper concludes that panentheists reduce the\nscope and power of God\u2019s immanence (J. Cooper, 2006, 330). M.\nLeidenhag criticizes the panentheist rejection of ontological\ndifference between divine influence and natural causes for making the\nnotion of divine influence ontologically superfluous (M. Leidenhag\n2014, 209\u2013210). Similarly, Mariusz Tabaczek requires that the\ndifference between God and the world hold that God is distinct and\nutterly different from all created entities (Tabaczek 2022, 631). The\npanentheistic God changes because God needs the world and thus is\nchanged by changes in the world (Tabaczek 2022, 633). Because God\nchanges, God is not essentially identical to God, God\u2019s aseity\nis compromised by including potential rather than being fully actual\n(Tabaczek 2022, 634). God loses metaphysical independence from\ncreatures, and has only a relative transcendence, transcendence of\ndifference rather than transcendence of being (Tabaczek 2022, 634).\nEfforts to justify a mutual relation fail to recognize that relation\nis posterior to substance, things need to be what they are in order to\nrelate (Tabaczek 2022, 638). If God is not ontologically different\nfrom the world, God lacks the omni characteristics and an adequate\ntype of transcendence. According to J. Cooper, if God\u2019s\ntranscendence does not infinitely exceed God\u2019s immanence,\nGod\u2019s presence, knowledge, and power are limited rather than\ncomplete, immediate, and unconditioned (J. Cooper 2006,\n322\u2013328). Whitehead\u2019s understanding of God\u2019s\ntranscendence is limited because God only influences events before or\nafter the decisions of the events. Likewise, Hegel\u2019s denial of\ndivine simplicity makes ontological difference between God and the\nworld impossible thus limiting God\u2019s transcendence (Tabaczek\n2013, 151, 154).\n\nThe panentheistic response to the foundational issue of the\nontological distance between God and world is that the essential\ndifferences between God and the world adequately distinguish God from\nthe world. Clayton argues that the differences in essence and function\nbetween God and creation preserve the divinity of God (Clayton 2001,\n10). Humans are constituted by free and finite relatedness but God has\na primordial and essential nature (Clayton 2005, 254). Real change\ndoes occur in the divine experience, but not in the divine nature\n(Clayton 2019, 9). God is prior to the evolution of the natural world\nbecause creation is contingent (Macallan, 376). The divine act of\ncreation exceeds the individual identities and their transcendence\nover other created beings. Divine transcendence is not mere\nself-transcendence of created beings because the actions of all finite\nagents participate in the divine act (Clayton 2008a, 216). God\u2019s\ntranscendence is found in God\u2019s awareness of all that occurs\nwithin the world but this transcendence is much more intimate than an\nexternalist or substantialist model can account for (Clayton 2008a,\n148).\n\nTop-down causation indicating God\u2019s vertical transcendence is a\nfurther response that Clayton and others have made to critiques about\nthe absence ontological difference. But Jensen finds this inadequate\nbecause they are unable to verify clearly God\u2019s presence in the\ncausal nexus of the world (2014, 131). However, Bracken rejects the\nnecessity of a causal joint when both top-down and bottom-up causation\ntakes place (2014, 10). Also, Clayton counters that few process\npanentheists accept a full equality between finite actual occasions\nand the divine actual occasion or occasions. While God and finite\nrealities are equal in having existence, God being the chief\nexemplification of creativity indicates a difference between God and\nactual occasions and thus a vertical transcendence (Clayton 2015b,\n27). Finally, Bracken\u2019s field understanding of panentheism gives\npriority to God as the regent subsociety that communicates a unifying\npatter of operation just as mind does in human existence (2014,\n79\u201380).\n\nSeveral challenges to panentheism claim that the absence of an\nontological difference between God and the world means that\npanentheism cannot account for God\u2019s causal influence on the\nworld. J. Leidenhag concludes that salvation through emergence as the\nmeans of divine action cannot explain how an individual can accelerate\nevolutionary development to significant change rather than gradual\ndevelopment (J. Leidenhag 2016, 872). M. Leidenhag thinks that the\nabsence of ontological difference runs the risk of making the notion\nof divine influence ontologically superfluous (M. Leidenhag 2014,\n209\u2013210). Panentheistic explanations of divine causation argue\nthat the differences between God and the world allow for divine\ncausation without control of creation. Clayton argues that differences\nin essence and function between God and the world preserve the\ndivinity of God so that it is not necessary to locate creation outside\nof God (2001, 210). Bringing emergence together with transcendence\nrecognizes that the physical is not closed and in downward causation\ncan be influenced by the non-physical. Science is coming to understand\nmatter as having a propensity to self-organization leading to more and\nmore complex systems that display new qualities that are not present\nat simpler stages (Clayton 2001, 209). \u201cJust as the\nneurophysiological structure of the higher primates is \u2018upwardly\nopen\u2019 to the emergence and causal power of the mental, so the\nmental or cultural world is upwardly open to the influence of the\nCreator Spirit.\u201d (Clayton 2003, 211). This makes possible an\ninternalist understanding of God\u2019s action and creativity.\nConcepts of emergence and system levels avoid the dilemma between\nupward and downward causation by understanding causation as circular,\ninvolving interacting effects between different levels of organization\n(Clayton 2008a, 68). Bringing emergence together with transcendence\nrecognizes that a divine source entails divine involvement with the\nworld (Clayton 2004c, 185). Divine causality is best understood as a\nform of causal influence that prepares and persuades. History in this\nsense is the result of divine persuasion and is open (Clayton 2008a,\n198).\n\nHowever, a concept of divine causation risks raising the problem of\nevil if divine causation is the sole source of reality. J. Leidenhag\npoints out that if God generates the world with all its inequality and\ninjustice God becomes responsible for evil with all the issues of\ntheodicy (J. Leidenhag 2016, 879). Thomas J. Oord illustrates a\ntypical panentheist response to the critique that a panentheist\nconcept of God makes God responsible for evil. For Oord, God\u2019s\nlove is inherently uncontrolling (Oord 2019, 30). God\u2019s love\nempowers others giving them the possibility of choosing to do evil.\nGod does not create or cause evil. Clayton describes all the actions\nof finite agents as participating in the divine act in a way that\ntheir partial autonomy of action is preserved (Clayton 2008a, 216).\nThe autonomy of finite actions makes possible the existence of\nevil.\n\nBut if God does not control all that happens, the question of if God\ncan guarantee the defeat of evil arises. If God cannot finally\novercome evil, God is not worthy of worship. A closely related\ncritique is that the panentheistic God is unable to guarantee a future\ngood. While panentheists agree that human freedom logically precludes\nGod\u2019s prevention of future evil that results from human choice,\nmany affirm that God\u2019s response to unpreventable evil is that\nGod suffers with the person suffering evil. However, God\u2019s\nsuffering with a person does not offer any guarantee that evil will be\novercome. But the support of a relationship with God does offer a\nbasis for the hope of overcoming evil. Clayton and Bracken maintain\nthat the world does influence God but God\u2019s will, expressed\nthrough the decisions that God makes, protects God\u2019s ability to\nsave (Clayton 2005). Moltmann\u2019s description of God\u2019s\nessence as directing God\u2019s activity in order to maintain the\nreliability of God as love acting on behalf of creation provides an\nexplanation of how God acts to overcome evil. Moltmann does not find\nit necessary to protect divine freedom by giving it priority over\ndivine love but rather understands freedom as acting according to the\ndivine nature of love (Moltmann 1981, 98, 99). Even more specifically,\nGriffin\u2019s discussion of divine variable action allows for\nspecific and distinctive manifestations of divine love (2004, 45).\nBut, Alexander Jensen criticizes the ability of the panentheist\nconcept to save by distinguishing between salvation by God and\nsalvation through agents of their own salvation (2014, 12\u201313).\nFor him a process panentheist\u2019s God can only draw and persuade\nrather than save (Jensen 2014, 128). Kenneth Pak concludes that an\nopen future makes any ultimate victory over evil impossible (2014,\n223\u2013224). In response, B. Cooper lists five ways in which a\nprocess theology supports God\u2019s power over other realities and\nevil: 1) ontological priority in providing definition, God\u2019s\nexistence establishes the nature of all that exists, 2) universality\nto all actuality, actual existence occurs due to divine actuality, 3)\nas the ground of novelty, God makes possible new realities, 4) as the\nground and preserver of all value, God preserves all value, and 5) as\nthe unconditioned character of God\u2019s integrity seeking to\nincrease value in the world and love towards the world, God\u2019s\nincrease of value and love depends only upon God (1974, 102). Palmyre\nOomen finds three similar elements in Whitehead\u2019s thought that\nrelate to God\u2019s governing and sustaining the world: 1) God\noriginates all occasions by presenting the initial aim which provides\nsome direction against evil, 2) God preserves all that can be\npreserved, and 3) God as everlasting means that no occasion can\novercome God forever (2015, 287\u2013288).\n\nAnalytic theology (Jeanine Diller and Asa Kasher, eds. 2013; Andrei A.\nBuckareff and Yujin Nagasawa, eds. 2016) offers a different type of\ncritique of panentheism. Analytical approaches to panentheism critique\npanentheism as lacking a distinctive identity making careful\nidentification, research, and development of a distinctive position\nimpossible. Two responses to this challenge to identify the\ndistinctiveness of panentheism have developed. One response seeks to\nidentify a defining characteristic. The second response affirms the\nrichness of diversity and suggests certain commonalities distinguish\npanentheism from other forms of theism.\n\nBenedikt G\u00f6cke\u2019s effort to identify a specific\ncharacteristic of panentheism notes the similarities of classical\ntheism and panentheism and concludes that the crucial difference is a\nmodal difference in that the world is not necessary for God in\nclassical theism while the world is necessary for God in panentheism\n(2013b). Raphael Lataster challenges G\u00f6cke\u2019s limitation of\nthe distinction between classical theism and panentheism by claiming\nthat panentheism\u2019s rejection of divine immutability\ndistinguishes panentheism from classical theism (2014). G\u00f6cke\nrejects this distinction as failing to recognize that spatial\nreferences are not adequate in dealing with metaphysical rather than\nphysical or logical necessity (2014). G\u00f6cke makes the\nrequirements for the distinction between classical theism and\npanentheism more specific by calling for a consistent definition of\n\u201cin\u201d by panentheists and by noting the presence of\nlogically contradictory but self-consistent interpretations of key\nnotions by various panentheists (2015). Yujin Nagasawa develops the\nconcept of modal panentheism by describing modal panentheism as\nholding that God is the totality of all possible worlds and that all\npossible worlds exist to the same extent that the actual world exists.\nThus, God includes all possible worlds and any actual worlds. But\nNagasawa also notes that modal panentheism has some similarities to\nclassical theism which limits any modal distinction between classical\ntheism and panentheism (2016). R. T. Mullins provides further evidence\nand refinement in identifying the distinctiveness of panentheism by\npointing out similarities among panentheism, open theism, and\nneo-classical theism and by critiquing G\u00f6cke\u2019s modal\ndistinction as failing to say anything unique about God. Both modal\ndistinctions and considering the world as God\u2019s body fail\nbecause they do not say anything unique about the nature of God\n(2016). Mullins offers an analytic response to the challenge regarding\nthe distinctiveness of panentheism by suggesting that panentheism can\ndistinguish itself from classical theism by making absolute space and\ntime attributes of God and by recognizing the distinction between\nabsolute time and space and physical and temporal realities contained\nwithin absolute time and space. Such a distinction offers a literal\nunderstanding of \u201cin\u201d in contrast to classical theism\n(2016). Oliver Crisp critiques Mullins\u2019s identification of\nabsolute space and time as attributes of God because that appears to\nmake God spatial and temporal (2019, 30\u201331). Pfeifer finds that\nMullins\u2019s identification of absolute time and space is helpful\nbut lacks clarity as to whether absolute time and space are attributes\nof God or the substance of God (2020, 130).\n\nA different response to the challenge that panentheism lacks a\ndistinctive characteristic suggests a symmetrical, mutual relation\nbetween God and the universe as the crucial characteristic of\npanentheism (Griffin 2004, 43\u201344; Keller 2008, 73; Clayton 215a,\n189; Gregersen 2004, 20, 22, 23; J. Cooper 2006, 29; Olson 2013, 330;\nMeister 2017, 5; Henriksen 2017, 1084; Stenmark 2019, 27; Gasser 2019,\n50).\n\nA variety of terms have been used to describe a mutual relation\nbetween God and the universe. Daniel Dombrowski (2013a, 32) described\nGod\u2019s relation to the universe as an organic relation in that\nGod and the universe influence each other. Niels Gregersen (2004, 20),\ncited by Stenmark (2019, 29), uses the phrase \u201cbilateral\nrelations\u201d. Stenmark calls God\u2019s relation to the world an\n\u201contological symmetrical\u201d relation in comparison to\nclassical theism\u2019s \u201casymmetrical\u201d ontological\ndependence. The basic nature of a mutual relation between God and the\nuniverse involves an influence of each member of the relationship on\nthe other member and assumes some degree of independence or freedom of\neach member.\n\nA mutual relation differs from the understanding of the God/world\nrelation in classical Christian theism. Panentheism and classical\nChristian theism both distinguish between God and the world. Classical\ntheism identifies this as an ontological difference. God\u2019s being\ndiffers from the being of the world. G\u00f6cke calls this a model\ndifference in which God\u2019s existence is necessary while the\nworld\u2019s existence is contingent (2013b). Stenmark describes this\nas God being ontologically distinct from the world in classical theism\nand contrasts that with panentheism as holding that God ontologically\nincludes the world (2019, 19, 27; G\u00f6cke 2017, 5\u20136). At\ntimes, classical Christian theism maintains the ontological difference\nbetween God and the world while allowing for the influence of the\nworld upon God by distinguishing between God\u2019s ontological\nnature and God\u2019s conceptual knowledge of the world or\nGod\u2019s compassion for the world (G\u00f6cke 2017, 3). God\u2019s\nknowledge may change as the world changes and God\u2019s care may\nrespond to different events in the world, but God\u2019s existence or\nessence is not changed (Stenmark 2019, 30). While God is immanent and\nactive in the world as well as transcendent for classical Christian\ntheism, the relationship between God and the universe is asymmetrical\nin that God influences the universe, but the universe does not affect\nGod (J. Cooper, 2006, 18, 22 and Stenmark 2019, 30). The world changes\nbecause of God\u2019s presence in the world, but this dynamic\nrelationship does not indicate any change in God\u2019s nature or\nwill.\n\nThe balance between God\u2019s transcendence and God\u2019s\nimmanence further refines the distinctiveness of panentheism\u2019s\nmutual relation between God and the universe in distinction from both\nclassical Christian theism and pantheism. By deriving divine immanence\nfrom divine transcendence, classical Christian theism prioritizes\nGod\u2019s transcendence (J. Cooper 2006, 328; Coman 2016, 82). In\ncontrast, Gregersen (2004, 19) balances transcendence and immanence.\nThus, panentheism affirms the basic role of divine immanence.\nLikewise, in contrast to pantheism\u2019s derivation of divine\ntranscendence from divine immanence, panentheism affirms God\u2019s\ntranscendence from the world. David Nikkel recognizes the importance\nof this balance even within panentheism. He warns against an\noveremphasis upon transcendence leading to the loss of the\nindeterminacy needed for growth that occurs in panentheism overly\ninfluenced by German idealism and an overemphasis on immanence leading\nto the loss of God as the source of existence that occurs in\npanentheism overly influenced by process thought (2016). The classical\nChristian tradition due to a variety of influences such as Platonic\ninfluence that stressed the reality of the forms in contrast to matter\nshaped by the forms (see Straus 2010) has tended to understand God as\nan unrelated Other to ordinary existence. Prioritizing divine\ntranscendence by calling for a deity unlimited by events in the world\nas seen in the doctrine of creation from nothing limits\ncreation\u2019s freedom to impact divine actions. While divine\nimmanence is not denied by the classical Christian tradition,\ntranscendence over all specific relations enables the immanence of the\ndivine relation to all of reality. God is present to all of reality\nbecause God exists independently from all other reality and is\nuninfluenced by other reality. This separation of divine reality from\nordinary, created reality makes the relationship of the divine to all\nof created reality an external relationship. The external nature of\nthis relationship becomes apparent in deviations from the classical\nChristian tradition such as deism. Because of the assumed external\nnature of God\u2019s relation to creation, God cannot logically be\nconceived of as being affected by created reality. God then does not\nrespond in any way to the created order but acts without consideration\nof the events of the world. Understanding God\u2019s transcendence in\nbalance with God\u2019s immanence enables a positive relation between\nscience and theology (Clayton 2020a) and provides a basis for morality\nand ethics (Ciocan 2016, 175).\n\nThe panentheistic mutual relation also differs from pantheism which\nprioritizes divine immanence by identifying the infinite with the\nfinite. The emphasis upon divine immanence seeks to affirm the\npresence of God in the world. In contrast to pantheism\u2019s\nderivation of divine transcendence from divine immanence, panentheism\naffirms God\u2019s transcendence from the world. If divine immanence\nrather than transcendence is stressed, even when that includes the\ninfluence of other realities, it fails to retain a robust concept of\ndivine transcendence. While some forms of this interest lead to\npantheism and the identity of God with the creation, the emphasis upon\nimmanence can acknowledge the need for a source of newness and novelty\nthat is not limited by, or to, the past. For panentheism the basis for\nthis novelty is internal to created reality rather than an external\nreality providing novelty. However, the question about the adequacy of\nthe novelty for the present situation must be considered. The\ntranscendence involved in the emphasis upon immanence is a horizontal\nrather than a vertical transcendence. A horizontal transcendence\ninvolves beings of the same ontological status. For example, a person\ndiffers from other persons and thus in a sense transcends the\nlimitation of other peoples\u2019 experiences just as they are not\nlimited to the first person\u2019s experiences. Newness and novelty\nthen arise from the unrealized potentials in the original situation.\nHowever, this limitation risks making radical novelty impossible\nbecause the context always limits the possibilities.\n\nAnother response to the challenge that panentheism lacks a distinctive\ncharacteristic recognizes the diversity of types of panentheism and\nsimilarities between some other forms of theism and panentheism (Olson\n2020 [Other Internet Resources]; Burch 1998; Gustafson 2011). This\ndiversity of panentheism and the similarities to other forms of theism\nrequires identifying panentheism by means of more than single\ncharacteristic (Lataster and Bilimoria 2018, 57\u201358). Several\nsuggestions about ways to identify the commonality among the diverse\nexpressions of panentheism and similar forms of theism have been made.\nMichael Brierley finds eight common themes in panentheism although all\neight themes may not be present in each expression of panentheism\n(2004, 6\u20138). Gregersen identifies a core common to all forms of\npanentheism, God contains the world so that the world belongs to God\nand there is a feeding back from the world into divine life (2017,\n582). This common core then is expressed in a variety of forms of\npanentheism as particular theologies (Gregersen 2017, 583). Stenmark\ndescribes panentheism as having core doctrines and extension claims\n(2019, 23). Panentheism and classical theism share extension claims\nthat God is the creator of the world and that continued existence of\nthe world depends upon God\u2019s ongoing creative activity. Both\npanentheism and classical theism maintain the immanence of God, but\nthey differ in that panentheism holds that God ontologically includes\nthe world while classical theism maintains an ontological distinction\nbetween God and creation. For Stenmark, the core claims of panentheism\nare that God ontologically includes the world and that God depends on\nthe world for God\u2019s own existence (2019, 25\u201326). Clayton\nsuggests that panentheism be considered a philosophical research\nprogram which may include sub-research programs. The panentheistic\nresearch program affirms the pervasiveness of change with real change\ntaking place in the divine experience but not in the divine nature.\nSince panentheists differ on whether creation is from nothing or is\nnecessary this is a sub-research program within panentheism (Clayton\n2019, 9\u201310).\n\nWhile the idea of panentheism may not be a philosophically stable\nconcept in itself, that instability makes possible respecification in\nlight of particular theologies (Gregersen 2017, 583). Thus the term\n\u201cpanentheism\u201d pointed to a balance between classical\ntheism and pantheism in the early twentieth century with its use of\n\u201cin\u201d. The growth of the influence of scientific thought\nupon theology leads to a more specific understanding of the balance in\nthe relation between God and the world that emphasizes the mutual\ninteraction of God and the world and moves on from the usefulness of\n\u201cin\u201d.\n\nThe varieties of panentheism participate in internal criticism.\nClayton (2008a, 127) and Steven Crain (2006) emphasize the dependence\nof the world upon God rather than the dependence of God upon the world\nalthough they maintain that God is influenced, and changed, by the\nworld. They criticize understandings of God that limit God by making\nGod subject to metaphysical principles. Griffin emphasizes the\nregularity provided by metaphysical principles. This regularity\nrecognizes the order in reality that the reliability of God\u2019s\nlove provides. Panentheists also caution that the emphasis upon the\nontological nature of the relation between God and the world can lead\nto a loss of the integrity of the world. Richardson warns against\nlosing the discrete identity of finite beings in God (2010, 345).\nCase-Winters calls for maintaining a balance between the distinction\nbetween God and the world and God\u2019s involvement with the world.\nOver-emphasis upon either side of the balance leads to positions that\nare philosophically and theologically inadequate (Case-Winters 2007,\n125).",
