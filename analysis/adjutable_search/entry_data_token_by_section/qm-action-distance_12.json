Superluminal signaling in the EPR/B experiment would be\npossible in theory just in case the value of some controllable\nphysical quantity in the nearby wing could influence the statistics of\nmeasurement outcomes in the distant wing. And in non-factorizable\nmodels that satisfy \u03bb-independence this could happen just in\ncase the following conditions obtained:\n\nControllable probabilistic dependence. The\nprobabilities of distant measurement outcomes depend on some nearby\ncontrollable physical quantity. \n \n\n\u03bb-distribution. There can be in theory an ensemble of particle pairs the states of which deviate from the quantum-equilibrium distribution; where the quantum-equilibrium distribution of pairs' states is the distribution that reproduces the predictions of orthodox quantum mechanics.\n\n\nFour comments: (i) In controllable probabilistic dependence, the term\n'probabilities of measurement outcomes' refers to the model\nprobabilities, i.e., the probabilities that the states \u03bb\nprescribe for measurement outcomes. \n\n \n\n(ii) Our discussion in this entry focuses on models of the EPR/B\nexperiment in which probabilities of measurement outcomes depend only\non the pair's state \u03bb and the settings of the measurement\napparatuses to measure certain properties. In such models, parameter\ndependence (i.e., the dependence of the probability of the distant\nmeasurement outcome on the setting of the nearby measurement\napparatus) is a necessary and sufficient condition for controllable\nprobabilistic dependence. But, recall (footnote 3) that in some models\nof the EPR/B experiment, in addition to the pair's state and the\nsetting of the L- (R-) measurement apparatus there are other local\nphysical quantities that may be relevant for the probability of the L-\n(R-) measurement outcome. In such models, parameter dependence is not\na necessary condition for controllable probabilistic dependence. Some\nother physical quantities in the nearby wing may be relevant for the\nprobability of the distant measurement outcome. (That is, let \u03b1\nand \u03b2 denote all the relevant local physical quantities, other\nthan the settings of the measurement apparatuses, that may be relevant\nfor the probability of the L- and the R-outcome, respectively. Then,\ncontrollable probabilistic dependence would obtain if for some pairs'\nstates \u03bb, L-setting l, R-setting r and local\nphysical quantities \u03b1 and \u03b2, P\u03bb\nl r \u03b1 \u03b2(yr) \u2260\nP\u03bb l r\n\u03b2(yr) obtained.) For the relevance\nof such models to the question of the in-principle possibility of\nsuperluminal signalling in some current interpretations of quantum\nmechanics, see sections 7.3 and 7.4. \n\n \n\n(iii) The quantum-equilibrium distribution will not be the same in all\nmodels of the EPR/B experiment; for in general the states \u03bb\nwill not be the same in different models. \n\n \n\n(iv) In models that actually violate both controllable probabilistic\ndependence and \u03bb-distribution, the occurrence of controllable\nprobabilistic dependence would render the actual distribution of\n\u03bb states as non-equilbrium distribution. Thus, if controllable\nprobabilistic dependence occurred in such models, the actual\ndistribution of \u03bb states would satisfy\n\u03bb-distribution. \n\n\nThe argument for the necessity of controllable probabilistic\ndependence and \u03bb-distribution is straightforward. Granted\n\u03bb-independence, if the probabilistic dependence of the distant\noutcome on a nearby physical quantity is not controllable, there can\nbe no way to manipulate the statistics of the distant outcome so as to\ndeviate from the statistical predictions of quantum\nmechanics. Accordingly, superluminal transmission of information will\nbe impossible even in theory. And if \u03bb-distribution does not\nhold, i.e., if the quantum-equilibrium distribution holds, controllable\nprobabilistic dependence will be of no use for superluminal\ntransmission of information. For, averaging over the model\nprobabilities according to the quantum-equilbrium distribution, the\nmodel will reproduce the statistics of orthodox quantum\nmechanics. That is, the distribution of the \u03bb-states will be\nsuch that the probabilistic dependence of the distant outcome on the\nnearby controllable factor will be washed out: In some states the\nnearby controllable factor will raise the probability of the distant\noutcome and in others it will decrease this probability, so that on\naverage the overall statistics of the distant outcome will be\nindependent of the nearby controllable factor (i.e., the same as the\nstatistics of orthodox quantum mechanics). Accordingly, superluminal\nsignaling will be impossible.\n\n\nThe argument for the sufficiency of these conditions is also\nstraightforward. If \u03bb-distribution held, it would be possible\nin theory to arrange ensembles of particle pairs in which controllable\nprobabilistic dependence would not be washed out, and accordingly the\nstatistics of distant outcomes would depend on the nearby controllable\nfactor. (For a proof that these conditions are sufficient for\nsuperluminal signaling in certain deterministic hidden variables\ntheories, see Valentini 2002.)\n\n\nNote that the necessary and sufficient conditions for superluminal\nsignaling are different in models that do not exclude in theory the\nviolation of \u03bb-independence. In such models controllable\nprobabilistic dependence is not a necessary condition for superluminal\nsignaling. The reasoning is as follows. Consider any empirically\nadequate model of the EPR/B experiment in which the pair's state and\nthe settings of the measurement apparatuses are the only relevant\nfactors for the probabilities of measurement outcomes, and the\nquantum-equilibrium distribution is \u03bb-independent. In such a\nmodel, parameter independence implies the failure of controllable\nprobabilistic dependence, yet the violation of \u03bb-independence\nwould imply the possibility of superluminal signaling: If\n\u03bb-independence failed, a change in the setting of the nearby\nmeasurement apparatus would cause a change in the distribution of the\nstates \u03bb, and a change in this distribution would induce a\nchange in the statistics of the distant (space-like separated)\nmeasurement outcome. \n\n\nLeaving aside models that violate \u03bb-independence, we now turn\nto consider the prospects of controllable probabilistic dependence and\n\u03bb-distribution, starting with no-collapse interpretations.\n",
