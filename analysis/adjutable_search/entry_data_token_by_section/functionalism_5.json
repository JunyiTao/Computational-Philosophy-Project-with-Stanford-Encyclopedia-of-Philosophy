    "main_text": "Varieties of Functionalism\n3. Varieties of Functionalism\n\nGiven this history, it is helpful to think of functionalist theories\nas belonging to one of three major strains \u2013 \u201cmachine\nstate functionalism\u201d, \u201canalytic functionalism\u201d, and\n\u201cpsychofunctionalism\u201d \u2013 and to see them as emerging,\nrespectively, from early AI theories, empirical behaviorism, and\nlogical behaviorism. It\u2019s important to recognize, however, that\nthere is at least some overlap in the bloodlines of these different\nstrains of functionalism, and also that there are functionalist\ntheories, both earlier and more recent, that fall somewhere in\nbetween. For example, Wilfrid Sellars\u2019s (1956) account of mental\nstates as \u201ctheoretical entities\u201d is widely regarded as an\nimportant early version of functionalism, but it takes the proper\ncharacterization of thoughts and experiences to depend partially on\ntheir role in providing a scientific explanation of behavior, and\npartly on what he calls the \u201clogic\u201d, or the a priori\ninterrelations, of the relevant concepts. Still, it is instructive to\ngive separate treatment to the three major strains of the doctrine, as\nlong as these caveats are kept in mind.\n",
