    "main_text": "Trope Applications || Tropes and Perception\n4.3 Tropes and Perception\n\nAnother important reason for thinking that tropes exist, it has been\nproposed, is the role tropes play in perception. That what we perceive\nare the qualities of the things rather than the things themselves,\nfirst, seems plausible (for various claims to this effect,\ncf. Williams 1953a: 16; Campbell 1997 [1981]: 130;\nSchaffer 2001: 247; cf. also Nanay 2012 and Alm\u00e4ng\n2013). And that the qualities we perceive are tropes rather than\nuniversals or instantiations of universals (states of affairs) is,\naccording to Lowe, a matter that can be determined with reference to\nour experience (cf. e.g., Skrzypulec 2021 for an argument to\nthe contrary). Lowe argues (1998: 205; cf. also, Lowe 2008;\nMulligan 1999):\n\n\n[W]hen I see the leaf change in colour\u2014perhaps as it\nturned brown by a flame\u2014I seem to see something cease to\nexist in the location of the leaf, namely, its greenness. But it\ncould not be the universal greenness which ceases to exist,\nat least so long as other green things continue to exist. My opponent\nmust say that really what I see is not something ceasing to exist, but\nmerely the leaf\u2019s ceasing to instantiate greenness, or greenness\nceasing to be \u2018wholly present\u2019 just here. I can only say\nthat that suggestion strikes me as being quite false to the\nphenomenology of perception. The objects of perception seem, one and\nall, to be particulars\u2014and, indeed, a causal theory of\nperception (which I myself favour) would appear to require this, since\nparticulars alone seem capable of entering into causal relations.\n\n\nA similar view is put forth by Mulligan et al. They argue (1984:\n306):\n\n\n[W]hoever wishes to reject moments [i.e., tropes] must of course give\nan account of those cases where we seem to see and hear them, cases we\nreport using definite descriptions such as \u2018the smile that just\nappeared on Rupert\u2019s face\u2019. This means that he must claim\nthat in such circumstances we see not just independent things per\nse, but also things as falling under certain concepts or\nas exemplifying certain universals. On some\naccounts\u2026it is even claimed that we see the universal in the\nthing. But the friend of moments finds this counterintuitive. When we\nsee Rupert\u2019s smile, we see something just as spatio-temporal as\nRupert himself, and not something as absurd as a spatio-temporal\nentity that somehow contains a concept or a universal.\n\n\nThese are admittedly not very strong reasons for thinking that it is\ntropes and not state of affairs that are the objects of perception.\nFor the view that our perception of a trope is not only distinct, but\nalso phenomenologically distinguishable, from our perception of a\nstate of affairs seems grounded in little more than its\nproponent\u2019s introspective intuitions. States of affairs, just\nlike tropes, are particulars (cf. Armstrong 1997: 126 on the\n\u201cvictory of particularity\u201d). And to say, as Mulligan et\nal. do, that the very idea of something spatiotemporal containing a\nuniversal is absurd, clearly begs the question against the view they\nare opposing.\n",
