Life and Work\n\nDetails about the life of John Cook Wilson, or \u2018Cook\nWilson\u2019 as he is commonly called, may be found in a memoir\npublished in 1926 by his pupil A. S. L. Farquharson, in his edition of\nCook Wilson\u2019s posthumous writings, Statement and Inference\nwith other Philosophical Papers (SI, xii\u2013lxiv). He was born\nin Nottingham on June 6, 1849, the son of a Methodist minister.\nEducated at Derby Grammar School, he went up to Balliol College in\n1868, elected on an exhibition set up by Benjamin Jowett for students\nfrom less privileged schools. At Balliol, Cook Wilson read classics\nwith Henry Chandler, from whom he certainly got his penchant for\nminutiae, and mathematics with Henry J. S. Smith. He also studied\nphilosophy with Jowett and T. H. Green, who steered him towards Kant\nand idealism (SI, 880), along with other students from his generation,\nsuch as Bernard Bosanquet, F. H. Bradley, Richard Lewis Nettleship and\nWilliam Wallace. He even went to G\u00f6ttingen in 1873\u201374 to\nattend lectures by Hermann Lotze (SI, xxvii), whose portrait he kept\nin his study. Cook Wilson wrote late in his life that \u201cfrom the\nfirst I would not commit myself even to the most attractive form of\nidealism, tho\u2019 greatly attracted by it\u201d (SI, 815).\nFarquharson also mentions Friedrich Ueberweg\u2019s System of\nLogic and History of Logical Doctrines (Ueberweg 1871) as an\nearly \u2018realist\u2019 influence (SI, 880). If we are to follow\nPrichard, however, Cook Wilson abandoned idealism \u201cwith extreme\nhesitation\u201d (Prichard 1919, 309) and \u201cit was only towards\nthe close of his life that he really seemed to find himself\u201d\n(Prichard 1919, 318). (See also on this point Farquharson\u2019s\nreminiscence in (SI, xix).)\n\nCook Wilson was elected fellow of Oriel College in 1873 and he\nsucceeded Thomas Fowler as Wykeham Professor of Logic, New College in\n1889. Bernard Bosanquet, Thomas Case, and John Venn had been among his\nrivals. He finally moved to New College in 1901, where he remained\nuntil his death from pernicious anemia on 11 August 1915. His wife\nCharlotte, whom he had met in Germany, predeceased him; they had a son\n(Joseph 1916b, 557). Cook Wilson lived the uneventful life of an\nOxford don. Among his awards, he became Fellow of the British Academy\nin 1907. A Liberal in his convictions (SI, xxix), he did not get\ninvolved in politics, nor did he take a prominent part in the affairs\nof his university. (He is, for example, seldom mentioned in (Engel\n1983).) His most cherished extra-curricular activity appears to have\nbeen the development of tactics for military bicycle units.\n\nCook Wilson published little during his lifetime. Setting apart\npublications on military cycling and other incidental writings, the\nbulk of his publications were in his chosen fields of study, classics\nand mathematics. His work in Ancient philosophy, which form the bulk\nof his publications, is discussed in the next section.\n\nIn mathematics, he published a strange treatise that arose out of his\nfailed attempt at proving the four-colour theorem, On the\nTraversing of Geometrical Figures (TGF). It had virtually no\necho. Farquharson quoted the mathematician E. W. Hobson explaining\nthat Cook Wilson \u201chardly gave sufficient time and thought to the\nsubject to make himself really conversant with the modern aspects of\nthe underlying problems\u201d (SI, xxxviii). Cook Wilson also\npublished two short papers on probability (IP, PBT) in which he gave\nnew proofs of the discrete Bayes\u2019 formula and of Jacob\nBernouilli\u2019s theorem (this last being known today as the weak\nlaw of large numbers). Edgeworth called the former an \u201celegant\nproof\u201d (Edgeworth 1911, 378, n.10), but Cook Wilson was\nseemingly ignorant of an already better proof of the latter via the\nBienaym\u00e9-Chebyshev inequality (Seneta 2012, 448 & 2013,\n1104). His mathematical endeavours were otherwise largely wasted on\ntrying to prove the inconsistency of non-Euclidean geometries. Cook\nWilson claimed that he had \u2018apprehended\u2019 and thus\n\u2018knows\u2019 the truth of Euclid\u2019s axiom of the\nparallels\u2014he held it to be \u201cabsolutely self-evident\u201d\n(SI, 561)\u2014calling the idea of a non-Euclidean space a\n\u201cchimera\u201d (SI, 456) and non-Euclidean geometries\n\u201cthe mere illusion of specialists\u201d (SI, xxxix). He thus\ntried in vain to find a contradiction to \u201cconvince the rank and\nfile of mathematicians\u201d so that \u201cthey would at least not\nsuppose the philosophic criticism, by which I intended anyhow to\nattack, somehow wrong\u201d (SI, xcvi). (See section 5 for further\ndiscussion of the point about knowledge.)\n\nCook Wilson published very little in philosophy: his inaugural\nlecture, On an Evolutionist Theory of the Axioms (ETA, see\nalso SI, 616\u2013634), a critique of Spencer opening with a very\nshort encomium to Green and Lotze (ETA, 3\u20134), and a short piece\nin Mind (CLP) on the \u2018Barber Shop Paradox\u2019. In\nthe former, he argued that Spencer\u2019s claim that the criterion of\ntruth p is the impossibility to think its contradictory and\nthat this criterion is the product of evolution is based on a circular\nreasoning: to prove that the criterion results from evolution, one\nmust apply it. The \u2018Barber Shop Paradox\u2019\u2014not to be\nconfused with the \u2018Barber\u2019s Paradox\u2019\u2014is\nattributed to Lewis Carroll (Carroll 1894), but it originated in a\nprivate debate about \u2018hypotheticals\u2019 with Cook Wilson, who\nattempted his own solution in CLP (Moktefi 2007a, chap. v, sect. 2),\n(Moktefi 2007b), (Moktefi 2008, sect. 5.2), while Russell had already\nsatisfactorily resolved it in a footnote to The Principles of\nMathematics (Russell 1903, 18). Cook Wilson was also involved on\nthe same occasion in the genesis of Carroll\u2019s better-known\n\u2018paradox of inference\u2019, in \u2018What the Tortoise Said\nto Achilles\u2019 (Carroll 1895), which will be discussed in section\n8.\n\nCook Wilson\u2019s reluctance to publish was partly caused by the\nfact that he constantly kept revising his views. As mentioned, he\napparently reached a more or less stable viewpoint only late in his\nlife. One of his better-known sayings is that\n\n\n\u2026 the (printed) letter killeth, and it is extraordinary how it\nwill prevent the acutest from exercising their wonted clearness of\nvision. (SI, 872) [See also Collingwood (2013, 19\u201320).]\n\n\nHis argument was that authors that have committed to print their views\non a given issue would, should they prove to be erroneous, more often\nthan not feel obliged to defend them and to engage in pointless\nrhetorical exchanges instead of seeing immediately the validity of\narguments against them.\n\nAs a result, Cook Wilson resorted throughout his career to the\nprinting for private circulation of pamphlets, known as\nDictata, which he began revising for publication shortly\nbefore his death. Only 11 years later did the two volumes of\nStatement and Inference appear, in 1926, put together by\nFarquharson from his lecture notes and Dictata, along with\nsome letters. These volumes are subdivided in five parts and 582\nsections. Their arrangement, which is not Cook Wilson\u2019s, betrays\ntheir origin in his lectures in logic and in the theory of knowledge;\nalso interspersed are texts that originate from his study of and\nlectures on Plato and Aristotle. As the chronological table of the\nvarious sections shows (SI, 888\u20139), the texts thus assembled\nwere written at different dates and, in light of Cook Wilson\u2019s\nfrequent change of mind (including his move away from idealism), they\nexpress views that are at times almost contradictory. This makes any\nstudy of his philosophy particularly difficult and, more often than\nnot, accounts of his views are influenced by those, equally important,\nof his pupil H. A. Prichard.\n",
