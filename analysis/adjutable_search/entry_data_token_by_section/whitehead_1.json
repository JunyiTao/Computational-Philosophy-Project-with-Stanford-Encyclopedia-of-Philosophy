    "main_text": "Mathematics and Logic\n2. Mathematics and Logic\n\nWhitehead began his academic career at Trinity College, Cambridge\nwhere, starting in 1884, he taught for a quarter of a century. In\n1890, Russell arrived as a student and during the 1890s the two men\ncame into regular contact with one another. According to Russell,\n\n\nWhitehead was extraordinarily perfect as a teacher. He took a personal\ninterest in those with whom he had to deal and knew both their strong\nand their weak points. He would elicit from a pupil the best of which\na pupil was capable. He was never repressive, or sarcastic, or\nsuperior, or any of the things that inferior teachers like to be. I\nthink that in all the abler young men with whom he came in contact he\ninspired, as he did in me, a very real and lasting affection. (1956:\n104)\n\n\nBy the early 1900s, both Whitehead and Russell had completed books on\nthe foundations of mathematics. Whitehead\u2019s 1898 A Treatise\non Universal Algebra had resulted in his election to the Royal\nSociety. Russell\u2019s 1903 The Principles of Mathematics\nhad expanded on several themes initially developed by Whitehead.\nRussell\u2019s book also represented a decisive break from the\nneo-Kantian approach to mathematics Russell had developed six years\nearlier in his Essay on the Foundations of Geometry. Since\nthe research for a proposed second volume of Russell\u2019s\nPrinciples overlapped considerably with Whitehead\u2019s own\nresearch for a planned second volume of his Universal\nAlgebra, the two men began collaboration on what eventually would\nbecome Principia Mathematica (1910, 1912, 1913). According to\nWhitehead, they initially expected the research to take about a year\nto complete. In the end, they worked together on the project for a\ndecade.\n\nAccording to Whitehead\u2014inspired by Hermann\nGrassmann\u2014mathematics is the study of pattern:\n\n\nmathematics is concerned with the investigation of patterns of\nconnectedness, in abstraction from the particular relata and the\nparticular modes of connection. (1933 [1967: 153])\n\n\nIn his Treatise on Universal Algebra, Whitehead took a\ngeneralized algebra\u2014called \u2018universal\nalgebra\u2019\u2014to be the most appropriate tool for this study or\ninvestigation, but after meeting Giuseppe Peano during the section\ndevoted to logic at the First International Congress of Philosophy in\n1900, Whitehead and Russell became aware of the potential of symbolic\nlogic to become the most appropriate tool to rigorously study\nmathematical patterns.\n\nWith the help of Whitehead, Russell extended Peano\u2019s symbolic\nlogic in order to be able to deal with all types of relations and,\nconsequently, with all the patterns of relatedness that mathematicians\nstudy. In his Principles of Mathematics, Russell gave an\naccount of the resulting new symbolic logic of classes and\nrelations\u2014called \u2018mathematical logic\u2019\u2014as well\nas an outline of how to reconstruct all existing mathematics by means\nof this logic. After that, instead of only being a driving force\nbehind the scenes, Whitehead became the public co-author of Russell of\nthe actual and rigorous reconstruction of mathematics from logic.\nRussell often presented this reconstruction\u2014giving rise to the\npublication of the three Principia Mathematica\nvolumes\u2014as the reduction of mathematics to logic, both\nqua definitions and qua proofs. And since the 1920s,\nfollowing Rudolf Carnap, Whitehead and Russell\u2019s project as well\nas similar reduction-to-logic projects, including the earlier project\nof Gottlob Frege, are classified under the header of\n\u2018logicism\u2019.\n\nHowever, S\u00e9bastian Gandon has highlighted in his 2012 study\nRussell\u2019s Unknown Logicism that Russell and\nWhitehead\u2019s logicism project differed in at least one important\nrespect from Frege\u2019s logicism project. Frege adhered to a\nradical universalism, and wanted the mathematical content to be\nentirely determined from within the logical system. Russell and\nWhitehead, however, took into account the consensus, or took a stance\nin the ongoing discussions among mathematicians, with respect to the\nconstitutive features of the already existing,\n\u2018pre-logicized\u2019 branches of mathematics, and then\nevaluated for each branch which of several possible types of relations\nwere best suited to logically reconstruct it, while safeguarding its\ntopic-specific features. Contrary to Frege, Whitehead and Russell\ntempered their urge for universalism to take into account the\ntopic-specificity of the various mathematical branches, and as a\nworking mathematician, Whitehead was well positioned to compare the\npre-logicized mathematics with its reconstruction in the logical\nsystem.\n\nFor Russell, the logicism project originated from the dream of a\nrock-solid mathematics, no longer governed by Kantian intuition, but\nby logical rigor. Hence, the discovery of a devastating\nparadox\u2014later called \u2018Russell\u2019s\nparadox\u2019\u2014at the heart of mathematical logic was a serious\nblow for Russell, and kicked off his search for a theory to prevent\nparadox. He actually came up with several theories, but retained the\nramified theory of types in Principia Mathematica. Moreover,\nthe \u2018logicizing\u2019 of arithmetic required extra-logical\npatchwork: the axioms of reducibility, infinity, and choice. None of\nthis patchwork could ultimately satisfy Russell. His original dream\nevaporated and, looking back later in life, he wrote: \u201cThe\nsplendid certainty which I had always hoped to find in mathematics was\nlost in a bewildering maze\u201d (1959: 157).\n\nWhitehead originally conceived of the logicism project as an\nimprovement upon his algebraic project. Indeed, Whitehead\u2019s\ntransition from the solitary Universal Algebra project to the\njoint Principia Mathematica project was a transition from\nuniversal algebra to mathematical logic as the most appropriate\nsymbolic language to embody mathematical patterns. It entailed a\ngeneralization from the embodiment of absolutely abstract patterns by\nmeans of algebraic forms of variables to their embodiment by means of\npropositional functions of real variables. Hardy was quite right in\nhis review of the first volume of Principia Mathematica when\nhe wrote: \u201cmathematics, one may say, is the science of\npropositional functions\u201d (quoted by Grattan-Guinness 1991:\n173).\n\nWhitehead saw mathematical logic as a tool to guide the\nmathematician\u2019s essential activities of intuiting, articulating,\nand applying patterns, and he did not aim at replacing mathematical\nintuition (pattern recognition) with logical rigor. In the latter\nrespect, Whitehead, from the start, was more like Henri\nPoincar\u00e9 than Russell (cf. Desmet 2016a). Consequently, the\ndiscovery of paradox at the heart of mathematical logic was less of a\nblow to Whitehead than to Russell and, later in life, now and again,\nWhitehead simply reversed the Russellian order of generality and\nimportance, writing that \u201csymbolic logic\u201d only represents\n\u201ca minute fragment\u201d of the possibilities of \u201cthe\nalgebraic method\u201d (1947 [1968: 129]).\n\nFor a more detailed account of the genesis of Principia\nMathematica and Whitehead\u2019s place in the philosophy of\nmathematics, cf. Smith 1953, Code 1985, Grattan-Guinness 2000 and\n2002, Irvine 2009, Bostock 2010, Desmet 2010, N. Griffin et al. 2011,\nN. Griffin & Linsky 2013.\n\nFollowing the completion of Principia, Whitehead and Russell\nbegan to go their separate ways (cf. Ramsden Eames 1989, Desmet &\nWeber 2010, Desmet & Rusu 2012). Perhaps inevitably,\nRussell\u2019s anti-war activities and Whitehead\u2019s loss of his\nyoungest son during World War I led to something of a split between\nthe two men. Nevertheless, the two remained on relatively good terms\nfor the rest of their lives. To his credit, Russell comments in his\nAutobiography that when it came to their political\ndifferences, Whitehead\n\n\nwas more tolerant than I was, and it was much more my fault than his\nthat these differences caused a diminution in the closeness of our\nfriendship.
