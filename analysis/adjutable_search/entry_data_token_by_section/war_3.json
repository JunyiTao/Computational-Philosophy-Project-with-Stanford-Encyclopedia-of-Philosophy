    "main_text": "How Should We Think about the Morality of War? || Overarching Disputes in Contemporary Analytical Just War Theory\n2.3 Overarching Disputes in Contemporary Analytical Just War Theory\n\nEven within interactional just war theory, several second-order\ndisagreements underscore first-order disputes. First: when thinking\nabout the ethics of war, what kinds of cases should we use to test our\nintuitions and our principles? We can start by thinking about actual\nwars and realistic wartime scenarios, paying attention to\ninternational affairs and military history. Or, more clinically, we\ncan construct hypothetical cases to isolate variables and test their\nimpact on our intuitions.\n\nSome early revisionists relied heavily on highly artificial cases\n(e.g., McMahan 1994; Rodin 2002). They were criticized for this by\ntraditionalists, who generally use more empirically-informed examples\n(Walzer 2006). But one\u2019s standpoint on the substantive questions\nat issue between traditionalists and revisionists need not be\npredetermined by one\u2019s methodology. Revisionists can pay close\nattention to actual conflicts (e.g., Fabre 2012). Traditionalists can\nuse artificial hypotheticals (e.g., Emerton and Handfield 2009; Lazar\n2013).\n\nAbstraction forestalls unhelpful disputes over historical details. It\nalso reduces bias\u2014we are inclined to view actual conflicts\nthrough the lens of our own political allegiances. But it also has\ncosts. We should be proportionately less confident of our intuitions\nthe more removed the test case is from our lived experience.\nPhilosophers\u2019 scenarios involving mind-control, armed\npedestrians, trolleys, meteorites, and incredibly complicated causal\nsequences are pure exercises in imagination. How can we trust our\njudgements about such cases more than we trust our views on actual,\nrealistic scenarios? What\u2019s more, abandoning the harrowing\nexperience of war for sanitized hypothetical cases might be not merely\nepistemically unsound, but also disrespectful of the victims of war.\nLastly, cleaned-up examples often omit morally relevant\ndetails\u2014for instance, assuming that everyone has all the\ninformation relevant to their choice, rather than acknowledging the\n\u201cfog of war\u201d, and making no allowances for fear or\ntrauma.\n\nArtificial hypotheticals have their place, but any conclusions they\nsupport must be tested against the messy reality of war. What\u2019s\nmore, our intuitive judgements should be the starting-point for\ninvestigation, rather than its end.\n\nThe second divide is related to the first. Reductivists think\nthat killing in war must be justified by the same properties that\njustify killing outside of war. Non-reductivists, sometimes\ncalled exceptionalists, think that some properties justify\nkilling in war that do not justify killing outside of\n war.[7]\n Most exceptionalists think that specific features of killing in war\nmake it morally different from killing in ordinary life\u2014for\nexample, the scale of the conflict, widespread and egregious\nnon-compliance with fundamental moral norms, the political interests\nat stake, the acute uncertainty, the existence of the law of armed\nconflict, or the fact that the parties to the conflict are organized\ngroups. A paradigm reductivist, by contrast, might argue\nthat justified wars are mere aggregates of justified acts of\nindividual self- and other-defence (see Rodin 2002; McMahan 2004a).\n\nReductivists are much more likely to use far-fetched hypothetical\ncases, since they think there is nothing special about warfare. The\nopposite is true for exceptionalists. Walzer\u2019s first critics\nrelied on reductivist premises to undermine the principles of national\ndefence (Luban 1980a; Rodin 2002), discrimination (Holmes 1989;\nMcMahan 1994), and combatant equality (Holmes 1989; McMahan 1994).\nMany traditionalists replied by rejecting reductivism, arguing that\nthere is something special about war that justifies a divergence from\nthe kinds of judgements that are appropriate to other kinds of\nconflict (Zohar 1993; Kutz 2005; Benbaji 2008; Dill and Shue 2012).\nAgain, some philosophers buck these overarching trends (for\nreductivist traditionalist arguments, see e.g., Emerton and Handfield\n2009; Lazar 2015c; Haque 2017; for non-reductivist revisionist\narguments, see e.g., Ryan 2016).\n\nThe debate between reductivism and exceptionalism is\noverblown\u2014the concept of \u201cwar\u201d is vague, and while\ntypical wars involve properties that are not instantiated in typical\nconflicts outside of war, we can always come up with far-fetched\nhypotheticals that don\u2019t involve those properties, which we\nwouldn\u2019t call \u201cwars\u201d. But this masks a deeper\nmethodological disagreement: when thinking about the morality of war,\nshould we start by thinking about war, or by thinking about the\npermissible use of force outside of war? Should we model justified\nkilling in war on justified killing outside of war? Or, in focusing on\nthe justification of killing in war, might we then discover that there\nare some non-canonical cases of permissible killing outside of war? My\nown view is that thinking about justified killing outside of war has\nits place, but must be complemented by thinking about war\ndirectly.\n\nNext, we can distinguish between individualists and collectivists; and\nwe can subdivide them further into evaluative and\ndescriptive categories. Evaluative individualists think that\na collective\u2019s moral significance is wholly reducible to its\ncontribution to the well-being of the individuals who compose it.\nEvaluative collectivists think that collectives can matter\nindependently of how they contribute to individual well-being.\nDescriptive individualists think that any act that might appear to be\ncollective is reducible to component acts by individuals. Descriptive\ncollectivists deny this, thinking that some acts are irreducibly\n collective.[8]\n\nAgain, the dialectic of contemporary just war theory involves\nrevisionists first arguing that we cannot vindicate traditionalist\npositions on descriptively and evaluatively individualist grounds,\nwith some traditionalists then responding by rejecting descriptive\n(Kutz 2005; Walzer 2006; Lazar 2012b) and evaluative individualism\n(Zohar 1993). And again there are outliers\u2014individualist\ntraditionalists (e.g., Emerton and Handfield 2009) and collectivist\nrevisionists (e.g., Bazargan 2013).\n\nUnlike the reductivist/exceptionalist divide, the\nindividualist/collectivist split cannot be resolved by thinking about\nthe morality of war on its own. War is a useful test case for theories\nof collective action and the value of collectives, but no more than\nthat. Intuitions about war are no substitute for a theory of\ncollective action. Perhaps some collectives have value beyond their\ncontribution to the well-being of their members. For example, they\nmight instantiate justice, or solidarity, which can be impersonally\nvaluable (Temkin 1993). It is doubtful, however, that groups have\ninterests independent from the well-being of their members.\nOn the descriptive side, even if we can reduce collective actions to\nthe actions of individual members, this probably involves such\ncomplicated contortions that we should seriously question whether it\nis worth doing (Lazar 2012b).\n",
