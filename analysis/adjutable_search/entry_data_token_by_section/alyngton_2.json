    "main_text": "Universals and Predication\n3. Universals and Predication\n\nAmong the many kinds of beings (entia) that Alyngton admits,\nthe most important set is that consisting of universal items.\nUniversals are among the most disputed topics in Medieval\nphilosophical literature. Like Wyclif and the other Oxford Realists,\nAlyngton claims that universals fully exist outside the mind and are\nreally identical-to and formally distinct-from the individuals which\ninstantiate them. Like Albert the Great whom he quotes by name,\nAlyngton recognizes three main kinds of universals:\n\nante rem or ideal universals\u2014that is, the ideas in\nGod, the archetypes of all that is;\nin re or formal universals\u2014that is, the common\nnatures shared by individual things; and\npost rem or intentional universals\u2014that is, mental\nsigns of the formal universals.\n\n\nThe ideas in God are the causes of formal universals, and formal\nuniversals are the causes of intentional universals. Furthermore, like\nBurley and Wyclif, Alyngton holds that formal universals actually\nexist (in actu) outside our minds, and not potentially only\n(in potentia) as moderate realists thought (In Cat.,\ncap. de substantia, p. 279)\u2014even if, unlike Burley, he\nmaintains they are really identical with their individuals, for\notherwise it would be impossible to explain, against the Nominalists,\nwhy and how individual substances show different and more or less\nclose kinds of similarity among themselves (In Cat., cap.\nde substantia, pp. 267\u201368).\n\nAccording to Alyngton, who depends here on Avicenna and Wyclif, formal\nuniversals are common natures in virtue of which the individuals that\nshare them are exactly what they are\u2014as the human species is the\nform by which every man formally is a man. Qua natures, they\nare prior, and so indifferent, to any division into universals and\nindividuals. Universality (universalitas or\ncommunicabilitas) is as it were their inseparable property,\nbut not a constitutive mark of the nature itself (In\nCat., cap. de substantia, fol. 101v). As a consequence,\nformal universals can be conceived of in two different manners: as\nfirst intentions or as second intentions. In the former case, they are\nnatures of a certain kind and are identical with their individuals\n(for example, man is the same thing as Socrates). In the latter case,\nthey are properly universals (that is, something that can exist in\nmany things and can be shared by them), and are distinct from their\nindividuals considered qua individuals, because of opposite\nconstitutive principles (In Cat., cap. de\nsubstantia, p. 268). Therefore, universals are really\n(realiter) identical to, but formally (formaliter)\ndistinct from their individuals. In fact, universals are formal causes\nin relation to their individuals, and individuals are material causes\nin relation to their universals. Thus three different kinds of\nentities can be qualified as formal universals:\n\nthe common natures instantiated by individuals\u2014which are\nthings of first intention;\nthe form itself of universality, which belongs to a certain common\nnature when seen in its relation to the individuals\u2014which is a\nthing of second intention; and\nthe thinkability proper to the common nature, by which it is a\npossible object of our mind\u2014that is, the real principle that\nconnects formal universals with mental universals (In Cat.,\ncap. de substantia, p. 277).\n\n\nAlyngton accepts the traditional realistic account of the relationship\nbetween formal universals and individuals, and, like Wyclif, improves\nit by defining its logical structure more accurately, in order to\navoid the inconsistencies stressed by Ockham and his followers.\nAlyngton thought that a universal of the category of substance could\ndirectly receive only the predications of substantial forms more\ncommon than itself. On the other hand, accidental forms inhering in\nsubstantial individuals could be predicated only indirectly\n(essentialiter) of the substantial form itself that those\nindividuals instantiate, predicated indirectly through and in virtue\nof the individuals of that substantial form. So his description of the\nlogical structure of the relationship between universals and\nindividuals demanded a redefinition of predication. Alyngton was\nprobably the first to ameliorate Wyclif\u2019s theory of predication\nby dividing predication into formal predication (praedicatio\nformalis) and remote inherence (inhaerentia remota) or\npredication by essence (praedicatio secundum essentiam).\nRemote inherence is grounded in a partial identity between subject and\npredicate, which share some but not all metaphysical constituents, and\ndoes not demand that the form signified by the predicate term be\ndirectly present in the entity signified by the subject term. On the\nother hand, such a direct presence is needed by formal predication.\n\u201cMan is an animal\u201d and \u201cSocrates is white\u201d are\ninstances of formal predication; \u201c(What is) singular is (what\nis) common\u201d (singulare est commune) and \u201cHumanity\nis running\u201d (humanitas est currens) are instances of\nremote inherence, as according to Alyngton it is possible to attribute\nthe property of being running to the form of humanity if at least one\nman is running. However, he makes sure to use as a predicate term a\nsubstantival adjective in its neuter form, because only in this way\ncan it be made apparent that the form signified by the predicate term\nis not directly present in the subject, but is indirectly attributed\nto it, through its individuals (In Cat., cap. de\nsubstantia, pp. 288\u201390).\n",
