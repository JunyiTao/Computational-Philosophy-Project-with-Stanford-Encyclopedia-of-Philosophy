    "main_text": "Objections to Emotivism and Relativism || Commitment and Inconsistency\n8.6 Commitment and Inconsistency\n\n\nI am accused of inconsistency, perhaps justly, because, although I\nhold ultimate ethical valuations to be subjective, I nevertheless\nallow myself emphatic opinions on ethical questions.\n\n\nThus wrote Russell in reply to critics who thought that his emotivism\nprecluded him from being so relentlessly preachy. There was, they\nthought, some kind of pragmatic inconsistency between vehement moral\nopinions (frequently voiced) and meta-ethical emotivism (RoE:\n145\u2013150/Papers 11: 48\u201352). Russell makes short\nwork of this. In his view the function of the words \u201cgood\u201d\nand \u201cbad\u201d is to express certain kinds of desires. Since he\nhad the relevant desires there was no inconsistency in his\nusing \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d to express the desires\nthat they were designed to express. There is nothing inconsistent\nabout using a piece of verbal machinery to do what you think it is\ndesigned to do.\n\n\nI am quite at a loss to understand why any one should be surprised at\nmy expressing vehement ethical judgments. By my own theory, I am, in\ndoing so, expressing vehement desires as to the desires of mankind; I\nfeel such desires, so why not express them?\n\n\nNor (as he might have added) is there any inconsistency between\nRussell\u2019s meta-ethical emotivism and his moral and political activism.\nTo think, for example, that nuclear war would be bad is to desire that\neveryone not desire it, a desire that presumably springs from a\nfirst-order desire that there should be no such thing. In trying to\navert nuclear war, therefore, Russell was acting on a desire that for\nhim had a high priority. Which looks like an eminently rational thing\nto do.\n",
