    "main_text": "Social Choice and Democracy\n7. The Boundary Problem: Constituting the Demos\n\nIf democratic societies allow members to participate as equals in\ncollective decision making, a natural question arises: who has the\nright to participate in making collective decisions? We can ask this\nquestion within a particular jurisdiction (ought all adults have the\nright to participation? Ought children have the right to\nparticipation? Ought all residents have such rights?). But we can also\nask what the extent of the jurisdiction ought to be. How many of the\npeople in the world ought to be included in the collective\ndecision-making? An easy, though slightly misleading, way of asking\nthis question is, what ought the physical boundaries of a particular\ninstitution of collective decision-making be? We see partially\ndemocratic societies within the confines of the modern nation-state.\nBut we might ask, why should we restrict the set of persons who\nparticipate in making decisions of the modern state just to those who\nhappen to be the physical inhabitants of those states? Surely there\nare many other persons affected by decisions made by democratic states\naside from those persons. For example, activities in one society\nA can pollute another society B. Why shouldn\u2019t the\nmembers of B have a say in the decisions regarding the\npolluting activities in A? And there can be many other effects\nthat activities in A can have on B.\n\nSome have suggested that the boundaries of a state ought to be\ndetermined through a principle of national self-determination. We\nidentify a nation as an ongoing group of persons who share certain\ncultural, historical and political norms and who identify with each\nother and with a piece of land. Then we determine the boundaries of\nthe territory by appeal to the size of the group of people and the\nland they cherish (Miller 1995; Song 2012). This is an appealing idea\nin many ways: shared nationality breeds a willingness to share the\nsacrifices that arise from collective decision making; it generates a\nsense of at-homeness for people. But it is hard to use as a general\nprinciple for dividing land among persons when one of the central\nfacts for many societies is that a diversity of nations, ethnic groups\nand cultures co-mingle on the very same land. \n\nIs there a democratic solution to the boundary problem? A number of\nideas have been suggested. The first idea is that the people ought to\ndecide what the boundaries are. But this suggestion, while it may be a\npragmatic resolution to the problem, seems to beg the question about\nwho the members are and who are not (Whelan 1983).\n\nA second theoretical solution that has some democratic credentials is\nto invoke the principle that all who are subjected to decision making,\nin the sense of who are coerced or have duties imposed upon them,\nought to have a say in the decision making (Abizadeh 2008). This\nprinciple is plausible enough, but it doesn\u2019t get at enough\ncases. The pollution case above is not a case of subjection.\n\nA third proposed theoretical solution is the all-affected principle.\nOne formulation is \u201call affected persons ought to have a say in\nthe decisions that affect them\u201d. This does suggest that when the\nactivities in one state affect those of another state, the people of\nthe other state ought to have a say in those activities. Some have\nthought that this principle tends to lead to a kind of politically\ncosmopolitan principle in support of world government (Goodin 2007).\n\n\nBut the all-affected principle is conceptually quite uncertain and\nmorally deeply problematic, and it provides very little, if anything,\nin the way of a solution to the boundary problem. \n\nFirst, \u201chaving a say\u201d is not clear. Does it require having\na vote in collective decision-making? Or is it also satisfied by a\nperson\u2019s being able to modify another\u2019s action by\nnegotiating with them, as we see when there is bargaining over an\nexternality? This latter version would undermine the idea that the\nall-affected principle has direct implications for the boundary\nproblem. When the United States permits activities that produce acid\nrain in Canada, Canada can negotiate with the United States to lessen\nthe production of acid rain and/or to compensate Canada for the harm.\nAs long as there is a fair and effective system of negotiation, this\nwould seem to satisfy the all-affected principle without giving\nCanadians a vote in American politics or Americans a vote in Canadian\npolitics.\n\nSecond, it is not clear what \u201cbeing affected\u201d means. One,\ndoes a person being affected just mean that there is a change in the\nperson\u2019s situation or must the effect involve the setting back\nof one\u2019s preferences, or interests, or legitimate interests, or\nexercise of one\u2019s capacities or one\u2019s good? Two, are\none\u2019s interests affected by a decision only when they are\nadvanced or set back relative to some baseline (either the present\nstate of affairs or some morally defined baseline like what you have\npromised me), or am I affected by decisions that could be to my\nadvantage or disadvantage but end up making no difference? For\nexample, if I am drowning in a pool and you are deciding whether to\nsave me or go buy yourself a candy bar, am I affected by your buying\nthe candy bar? If I am not affected when no change occurs, then who is\naffected by a decision often depends on who participates in the\ndecision and we have no solution to the problem of inclusion. If I am\naffected, then the principle has some quite extraordinary\nimplications. Now it turns out that impoverished persons in South Asia\nare affected by my buying a candy bar, since I could have sent the\nmoney to them (Goodin 2007).\n\nThe all-affected principle is a merely suggestive and rhetorically\neffective phrase. It is a conversation starter and a list of topics to\nbe discussed, not a genuine principle. For example, if I must include\neveryone possibly affected by my decision for every decision I make, I\nwill not be able to make many decisions and my decision making will no\nlonger enable me to give a shape to my own life and my relations with\nothers. My life becomes fragmented and lacks integrity (Williams\n1973). An analog of this problem would arise for political societies,\npresumably. Each society would have to include a variety of different\npersons in each decision. It is hard to see how any society could take\non any particular character if this is the case. \n\nA more plausible principle that encompasses some of the suggestions of\nthe all-affected principle is that a framework of institutions should\nbe set up so that people have power to advance and protect their\nlegitimate interests in life. \n\nBut if we understand the principle in this way, it is not clear that\nit helps us much with the boundary problem. First of all, there are\ndifferent ways in which people can be said to possess power over their\nlives. One kind of power is the power to participate as an equal in a\ncollective decision-making process. Another kind is to be able to\nadvance one\u2019s interests in a decentralized process like a market\nor a system of agreement making like international law. Recalling our\npollution problem above, we could give the state of which they are\nmembers power to negotiate with the polluting state terms that are\nmutually agreeable. Only the power to participate as an equal in\ncollective decision-making involves the boundaries of collective\ndecision-making. \n\nAnother solution to the boundary problem is a conservative one. The\nbasic idea is to keep the boundaries of states roughly as they are\nexcept if there is a pressing need to change them. Trying to alter the\nboundaries of political societies is a recipe for serious conflict\nbecause there is no institution that has the legitimacy or power\nactually to resolve problems at an international level and there is\nlikely to be a lot of disagreement on how to do it. States as we know\nthem, are by far the most powerful political entities in the\ninternational system. They have developed more effective practices of\naccountability of power than any other entity in the system. They have\ncreated unified societies with highly interdependent populations.\nFinally, states and the individuals in them can be made accountable to\nsome degree to other individuals and states through the process of\nnegotiation and international law making. The origin of these\nboundaries may be arbitrary, but it is not, for all that, irrelevant.\nTo be sure, there are clear cases where borders can be changed. One\nsource of pressing need is serious injustice within a country. Another\nmight be the existence of permanent minorities that are sectionally\ndefined. Here, we ask only how to revise boundaries and the basis of\nsuch revision is that it is a remedy for serious injustice (Buchanan\n1991).\n",
