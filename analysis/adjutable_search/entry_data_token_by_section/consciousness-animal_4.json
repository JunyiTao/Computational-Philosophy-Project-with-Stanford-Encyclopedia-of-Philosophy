    "main_text": "Epistemological and Metaphysical Issues || The Problem of Other Minds\n4.1 The Problem of Other Minds\nThe two questions might be seen as special cases \u2014 or,\nalternatively, as generalized versions \u2014 of the skeptical\n\u201cproblem of other minds\u201d \u2014 how can one know that\nothers have mental states that are anything like one\u2019s own?  Although\nthere is no generally accepted solution to this problem, it is\nnevertheless generally ignored to good effect by psychologists, and\nindeed by most people, who in practice are willing to take for granted\nthat others have mental states similar to theirs. However it is often\nthought that knowledge of animal minds presents special methodological\ndifficulties. First of all, nonhuman animals cannot describe their\nmental states using language. Although there have been attempts to\nteach human-like languages to members of other species, none has\nreached a level of conversational ability that would solve this\nproblem directly (see Anderson 2004 for a review). Furthermore, except\nfor some language-related work with parrots and dolphins, such\napproaches are generally limited to those animals most like ourselves,\nparticularly the great apes. But there is great interest in possible\nforms of consciousness in a much wider variety of species than are\nsuitable for such research.  More generally, the problem of other\nminds is more acute when applied to nonhuman animals because the\nsimilarities between our behavior and bodies, and those of others\nanimals (which form the basis for \u2018analogical\u2019 solutions\nto the problem of other minds) are less exact. As well, the perceptual\naccess to other minds that some have argued defuses the problem of\nother minds is arguably weaker regarding the minds of other animals.\n(Sober (2000) discusses of the problem of other minds within an\nevolutionary framework, and Farah 2008 provides a neuroscientist\u2019s\nperspective.)\n",
