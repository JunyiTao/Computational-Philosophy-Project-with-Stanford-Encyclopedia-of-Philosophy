    "main_text": "Sortals and cognition || Sortals, essences and basic level objects\n7.2 Sortals, essences and basic level objects\n\nGelman (2003,2013) and others have provided evidence suggesting a mode of cognition of an essentialist character already operative in children. Specific categories of object and stuff (such as those represented by mass terms and sortals for natural and social kinds, as well as for artifacts) are here assumed to possess an underlying reality that cannot be observed directly. This assumption explains and grounds children\u2019s inductive inferences based on the categories in question. It also explains children\u2019s implicit assignment of causal and other non-obvious properties, as well as sharp and immutable boundaries to such categories. Children view some of these properties as innate. Research results (Caccione et al. 2016; Mendes et al.2018, 2011; and Santos et al.2002) highlight the possibility that essentialist cognition might develop in humans at a pre-linguistic stage, in the form of sortal object individuation. This might apply to certain primates as well (Phillips et al.2010). \n\nA related line of research initiated by Rosch (1973), Rosch et\nal. (1976) suggests that there is a category of basic level\nobjects. Although context can lead to classifications at greater or\nlesser levels of specificity, in most contexts there is a common level\nof description that speakers prefer. For example, while we might\ngenerally describe something as a mammal or a poodle, the most common\nand natural noun would be \u201cdog\u201d. Rosch found considerable\ncommonality in what are regarded as basic level objects across\ncultures although there is some variation. Her characterization of the\nbasic level classifications is that those are the level at which\nrelatively accessible information (shape, color, form of movement)\nprovide the most information about other properties of the object. If\nit is self-moving and dog-shaped it is likely to bark, eat meat, chase\ncats, et cetera. \n\nAlthough Roschian basic level objects are good candidates for\ninformative answers to the question \u201cWhat is it?\u201d they do\nnot provide traditional essences. Traditional essences as\nconceptualized by philosophers and most psychologists are necessary\nand sufficient conditions for being a member of that kind. On that\nconception, learning a new sortal requires knowing the elements and\nhow they combine to define the new kind. On Rosch\u2019s conception,\nsortal words are learned in families and the primary learning\nexperience is becoming familiar with the prototypical members of the\nkind. Prototypes are the best examples, produce the quickest responses\nwhen subjects are queried about kinds, and are the most frequently\ncited when subjects are asked to give examples. In the category of\nbirds, robins are one of the most prototypical, swans are intermediate\nand penguins are very unprototypical. Evidence for Rosch\u2019s view\nof categories, which has clear roots in the views of Wittgenstein,\nconsists of the failure to produce adequate necessary and sufficient\nconditions for most common sortals, as well as the positive\nexperimental evidence just cited.\n\nRelated to the issues of essence, Markman (1989) and Markman et\nal. (2003) have argued that children\u2019s early language learning\nis guided by several principles, one of which is the mutual\nexclusivity constraint. This constraint is that in learning words a\nguiding assumption should be that distinct words refer to distinct\nthings. While this is not always true, Markman and others provide\nevidence that this constraint is operative, and that in the language\nlearning environment of young children it is a very helpful, if\nimperfect constraint. If Rosch is correct about the existence of a\npreferred basic level of objects, it may be that speakers generally\nuse words at that level of objects and thus the exclusivity constraint\nmay be supported by the basic level object hypothesis. However, the\nexperimental data are apparently conflicting on these questions\n(Mervis et al. 1994). Scholl (2008) provides a useful discussion of\nwhether and how philosophy and psychology can interact beneficially in\nunderstanding these issues.\n",
