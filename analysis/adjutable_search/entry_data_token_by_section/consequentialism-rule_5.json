    "main_text": "Formulating Full Rule-consequentialism\n6. Formulating Full Rule-consequentialism\n\nThere are a number of different ways of formulating\nrule-consequentialism. For example, it can be formulated in terms of\nthe good that actually results from rules or in terms of the\nrationally expected good of the consequences of rules. It can be\nformulated in terms of the consequences of compliance with rules or in\nterms of the wider consequences of acceptance of rules. It can be\nformulated in terms of the consequences of absolutely everyone\u2019s\naccepting the rules or in terms of the rules\u2019 acceptance by\nsomething less than everyone. Rule-consequentialism can also be\nformulated in terms of the teaching of a code to everyone in the next\ngeneration, in the full realization that the degrees of resulting\nacceptance will vary (Mulgan 2006, 2017, 2020; D. Miller 2014, 2021;\nT. Miller 2016, 2021). Rule-consequentialism is more plausible if\nformulated in some ways than it is if formulated in other ways. This\nis explained in the following three subsections. Questions of\nformulation are also relevant in later sections on objections to\nrule-consequentialism.\n",
