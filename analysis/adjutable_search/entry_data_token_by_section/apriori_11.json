    "main_text": "Should we doubt the evidential force of intellectual intuitions? || Can intuitions be checked for accuracy?\n6.3 Can intuitions be checked for accuracy?\n\nA different sort of objection to intuitions as a source of a\npriori evidence assumes that a source of justification must be\ncapable of being calibrated to determine whether it is accurate\n(Cummins 1998: 116\u2013118). What we see through a telescope\njustifies us in believing that the moon has mountains because we have\ndone things like looking through telescopes at distant mountains on\nearth and then gone to them and discovered that the telescopes\npresented an accurate picture of the mountains. But what, the\nobjection goes, can intuitions be checked against? Other intuitions?\nBut that is like checking a crystal ball against itself.\n\nBonJour has argued that many errors involving apparent rational\ninsights (intuitions) can be corrected internally by further\nreflection, or by appealing to coherence (BonJour 1998:\n116\u2013119). Others have replied that neither perception nor memory\n(Goldman 2007: 5) can be checked either, except against themselves,\nbut that does not prevent these sources from providing justification\nin certain circumstances.\n\nIn reply to this sort of response, critics of intuition-based views of\na priori justification have said that at least different\ntypes of perception can be checked against each other, say, vision\nagainst touch (Weatherson 2003: 4). The critics of intuition add that\nwhile we can distinguish circumstances where, say, vision is\nunreliable from circumstance where it is not, nothing similar can be\ndone when it is a matter of intuitions. For instance, we can\ndistinguish conditions where the lighting conditions, or the\nperson\u2019s eyesight, are bad from ones where they are not. We can\nknow whether we are in a desert where optical illusions occur and\nwhether we are not. At least sometimes we can tell whether we are\nhallucinating or not.\n\nFirst, the thought that a potential source of justification must be\ncapable of being calibrated if it is to provide justification seems\nfalse. The people inside Plato\u2019s cave who can only see shadows\ncast on the wall in front of them can be justified in believing that\nthose shadows have a certain shape based on what they see and the\nreports of others. A priori intuitions involve a kind of\nintellectual \u201cseeing\u201d, and they can be checked against\nother people\u2019s reports of their intuitions. That one type of\nperception can be checked against another (say, sight against touch)\ndoes not seem to count for much epistemically. Perhaps a ouija board\ncan be checked against a crystal ball, but without some further\nexplanation, neither agreement, nor disagreement, between them would\nhave significant epistemic implications. Perhaps intellectual or\nrational intuitions produced under certain circumstances should be\ndiscounted, viz., those produced by people who are angry, depressed,\ndrunk, tired, etc., or who are not impartial, have something at stake\nin the outcome, or have not reflected carefully on the relevant\nconcept. But that does not mean that all of them should be discounted.\nCalibration may not be necessary for justification. And in some\ncircumstances it seems insufficient, as when there is good reason to\nthink that agreement is accidental or the result of causes irrelevant\nfrom an epistemic standpoint.\n",
