    "main_text": "\n\nThe seventeenth-century French philosopher Nicolas Malebranche\n(1638\u20131715) famously argued that \u2018we see all things in\nGod.\u2019 This doctrine of \u2018Vision in God\u2019 is intended\nas an account both of sense perception of material things and of the\npurely intellectual cognition of mathematical objects and abstract\ntruths. The theological motivation for this doctrine is clear: Vision\nin God places us in immediate contact with God in our everyday\nexperience of the world and in our most private thoughts and musings.\nLike his other signature doctrine, \u2018Occasionalism\u2019 or the\nview that God is the only genuine cause, Vision in God is also rooted\nin Malebranche\u2019s conviction that we utterly depend on God in\nevery way.\n\nAlthough Malebranche was widely revered by his contemporaries as one\nof their leading lights \u2013 an equal to Descartes, Locke, and\nLeibniz \u2013 the theological spirit of his philosophy tarnished his\nreputation among Anglo-American philosophers in the last century.\nScholarship over the past thirty-five years, however, has begun to\nrestore his credentials as a philosopher of first rank by unveiling\nthe philosophical motivations for his doctrines, and by stressing his\ningenuity in solving problems bequeathed to him by his two great\nphilosophical forebears, Augustine and Descartes. Both of these\nvirtues are manifest in the doctrine of Vision in God.\n",
