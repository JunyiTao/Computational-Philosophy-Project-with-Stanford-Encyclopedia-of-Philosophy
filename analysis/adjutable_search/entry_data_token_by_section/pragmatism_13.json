    "main_text": "Pragmatism\u2019s Contribution in Other Areas of Philosophy || Ethics\n6.2 Ethics\n\nWe\u2019ve seen that philosophical pragmatism seeks to connect theory\nto practice. In ethics it can seem natural to interpret this as\nrecommending that normative notions be reduced to practical utility.\nThus James embraced utilitarian ethics as one of the branches of\npragmatism (James 1907). Peirce, however, took a different view.\nInitially (around 1898) his naturalism led him to advocate a\nsentimentalism according to which ethical questions should be\nsettled by instinct, as our conscious reasoning is too recently\nevolved and fallible to determine \u2018vitally important\nmatters\u2019. But around 1902 he began to warm towards ethical\ntheorising, as he developed a philosophical architectonic which placed\nethics directly prior to logic, since ethics studies what is good in\naction, and logic studies what is good in thought, which is a species\nof action. He noted, though, that such a \u2018normative\nscience\u2019 should be understood to study what goodness is,\nnot whether particular actions are good (by contrast to much normative\nethics today) since, \u2018a science cannot have for its fundamental\nproblem to distribute objects among categories of its own\ncreation\u2019 (CP 2.198). Recently scholars have turned with renewed\ninterest to developing Peirce\u2019s ethics (e.g. Massecar 2016;\nAtkins 2016). \n\nA rich and systematic early contribution to pragmatist value theory\nwas made by Alain Locke, who wrote, \u2018the gravest problem of\ncontemporary philosophy is how to ground some normative principle or\ncriterion of objective validity for values without resort to dogmatism\nand absolutism on the intellectual plane, and without falling into\ntheir corollaries, on the plane of social behavior and action, of\nintolerance and mass coercion\u2019 (Locke 1935: 336). Locke taught\nthat the distinctive feeling-qualities that values give rise to in us\nare our ultimate guide in studying them, although function has an\nimportant secondary role to play. He held the resulting axiology to be\npluralist, as well as culturally relativist.\n\nDewey also sought to steer ethics between the traditional poles of an\nobjectivism derived from some kind of human-transcendent authority,\nand a subjectivism derived from individual preference. He believed\nthat both views err in granting the moral agent an identity prior to\ninteractions with others. For Dewey, we are more frail beings than\nthis, embedded in a sociality that runs much deeper, and the purpose\nof moral theory is ultimately to provide constructive methods for\naddressing human problems of a particular kind: those in which we find\nourselves unable to choose between equally valuable ends, with a\ndearth of salient habits with which to cross the breach. With regard\nto such questions, much effort is required to clear away traditional\nethical theory\u2019s pretensions to deliver a spurious settled\ncertainty. Progress can be made by recognising the inherent\nuncertainty of moral problems and the complexities of moral experience\n(Hildebrand 2008: 73), and being willing to inquire anew in every\nmoral context, drawing in data from a variety of scientific\ndisciplines, in order to lay down new intelligent habits. The\nevolution of Dewey\u2019s ethical thinking across his long career is\nrichly explored in (Welchman 1995). \n\nIn recent decades, value theory has arguably been under-addressed by\npragmatists, due to neopragmatism\u2019s strong focus on philosophy\nof language and metaphilosophy. A notable recent attempt to develop a\npragmatist metaethics drawing on classical pragmatism is (Heney 2016),\nwhich forms part of the so-called New Pragmatism. \n",
