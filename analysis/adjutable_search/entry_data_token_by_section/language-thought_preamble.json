    "main_text": "\n\nThe language of thought hypothesis (LOTH) proposes that\nthinking occurs in a mental language. Often called Mentalese,\nthe mental language resembles spoken language in several key respects:\nit contains words that can combine into sentences; the words and\nsentences are meaningful; and each sentence\u2019s meaning depends in\na systematic way upon the meanings of its component words and the way\nthose words are combined. For example, there is a Mentalese\nword whale that denotes whales, and there is a\nMentalese word mammal that denotes\nmammals. These words can combine into a Mentalese\nsentence whales are mammals, which means that\nwhales are mammals. To believe that whales are mammals is to bear an\nappropriate psychological relation to this sentence. During a\nprototypical deductive inference, I might transform the Mentalese\nsentence whales are mammals and the Mentalese\nsentence Moby Dick is a whale into the\nMentalese sentence Moby Dick is a mammal. As I\nexecute the inference, I enter into a succession of mental states that\ninstantiate those sentences.\n\nLOTH emerged gradually through the writings of Augustine, Boethius,\nThomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, and many others. William of Ockham\noffered the first systematic treatment in his Summa Logicae\n(c. 1323), which meticulously analyzed the meaning and structure of\nMentalese expressions. LOTH was quite popular during the late medieval\nera, but it slipped from view in the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies. From that point through the mid-twentieth century, it\nplayed little serious role within theorizing about the mind.\n\nIn the 1970s, LOTH underwent a dramatic revival. The watershed was\npublication of Jerry Fodor\u2019s The Language of Thought\n(1975). Fodor argued abductively: our current best scientific theories\nof psychological activity postulate Mentalese; we therefore have good\nreason to accept that Mentalese exists. Fodor\u2019s analysis exerted\ntremendous impact. LOTH once again became a focus of discussion, some\nsupportive and some critical. Debates over the existence and nature of\nMentalese continue to figure prominently within philosophy and\ncognitive science. These debates have pivotal importance for our\nunderstanding of how the mind works.\n",
