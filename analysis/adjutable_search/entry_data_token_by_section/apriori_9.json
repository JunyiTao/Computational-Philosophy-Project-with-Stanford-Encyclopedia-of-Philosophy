    "main_text": "Should we doubt the evidential force of intellectual intuitions? || What exactly is an intellectual seeming or rational intuition?\n6.1 What exactly is an intellectual seeming or rational intuition?\n\nWe have seen that Bealer thinks that a rational intuition is a modal\nseeming: either a seeming to be true and necessarily true, or a\nseeming to be possible. In other places Russell (2017: 232) defines an\na priori intuition as the psychological state people are in\nwhen some proposition seems true to them solely on the basis\nof their understanding that proposition. This definition of an a\npriori intuition allows us to distinguish between what Bealer\ncalled a physical intuition that a house undermined will fall, because\nit does not seem true to us solely on the basis of understanding what\nit says, and the intuition that if P, then not not P, or\nthat if someone knows P, then she believes P and\nP is true. Unlike on Bealer\u2019s account of rational\nintuitions, this account of intuition does not require that the\npropositions that are the objects of intuitions be modal. It provides\na way of distinguishing a priori justifiable necessary\npropositions such as Necessarily, all bachelors are unmarried\nmales from empirically justifiable necessary propositions such as\nNecessarily, water is H2O since an intuition that\nthe former proposition is true can be based solely on a person\u2019s\nunderstanding it but an intuition that the latter is true must be\nbased partly on understanding how things are in the external world.\nThis account of intuition also allows that what are called synthetic\na priori proposition (like\n 10a\u201314a)\n can be the objects of a priori intuitions since they can\nseem true to a person solely on the basis of her understanding\nthem.\n\nSeveral philosophers appeal to the understanding in their accounts of\na priori justification: Bealer in all his many essays;\nBonJour 1998; Jackson 2000; Peacocke 2000; Sosa 2013: 199; Boghossian:\nforthcomingb. But the view also has its critics. Though Paul\nBoghossian thinks that some a priori justification stems from\nthat source, he thinks that a priori intuitions about\nsubstantive normative propositions can provide justification but they\ndo not rest on our understanding those propositions (forthcomingb).\nConsider the proposition that It is always wrong to torture\nchildren just for the fun of it. His argument is that if such\nintuitions were based on understanding the concept\n\u201cwrong\u201d, then it would not make sense to ask whether that\nsort of act merits disapproval or should be punished, assuming for the\nsake of argument that the correct account of the non-substantive\nmeaning of \u201cwrong\u201d is in terms of what merits disapproval\nor should be punished. But he thinks that this question always makes\nsense. So it follows that a priori normative intuitions of\nthis sort are not based on understanding the relevant normative\nconcepts. Boghossian seems to think that this argument generalizes to\napply to all a priori intuitions whose objects are synthetic\npropositions, not just to intuitions about substantive normative\npropositions.\n\nA possible response to Boghossian is that full or\ndeep understanding of normative concepts like\n\u201cwrong\u201d requires understanding that certain paradigm cases\nare wrong, though a more superficial understanding which can be\ncaptured by non-substantive account of wrong does not. An analogy with\ncausation might help. A superficial understanding of why opium causes\nsleep is that it has dormative powers. But a deeper, more detailed\nunderstanding would involve understanding how the chemicals in opium\naffect the neurons in the brain and how those in turn cause sleep.\nProblems will remain with the \u201clack of deep understanding\u201d\nreply to Boghossian\u2019s argument: how does one explain the fact\nthat professional moral philosophers sometimes have different\nintuitions about substantive claims about what is wrong? One would\nexpect them to have equally deep understanding of the relevant\nnormative concepts and so to have the same a priori\nintuitions on the understanding-based account of intuitions that\nBoghossian argues against. But sometimes they do not, as Boghossian\nnotes (forthcomingb). At the same time, he offers an explanation of\nwhy the intuitions of philosophers diverge: the theories they hold can\naffect the intuitions they have.\n",
