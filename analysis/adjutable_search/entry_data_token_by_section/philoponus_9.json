    "main_text": "Theological Treatises || On the Creation of the World\n4.1 On the Creation of the World\n\n\nPerhaps some fifteen years after his attack on\nAristotle on the eternity of the world (the date is disputed), Philoponus published a\ncommentary on the biblical creation story, On the Creation of the\nWorld (De opificio mundi), which is his only theological\nwork extant in Greek.  While discussing the biblical text, Philoponus\nfrequently refers to philosophers like Aristotle, Plato and Ptolemy as\nwell as to Basil the Great, whose own treatise on the creation\nserved him as inspiration. The De opificio mundi has received\nsome attention from historians of science, because Philoponus suggests\nat one point (I 12) that the movement of the heavens could be\nexplained by a \u2018motive force\u2019 impressed on the celestial\nbodies by God at the time of creation. As we have seen (2.2 above),\nPhiloponus discussed impetus theory for the first time in the context\nof trying to understand the physics of forced motion (Why does an arrow or stone continue to move after losing contact with its motive cause?). Now he\napplies the same theory to the regular and natural motions of the universe at large. Significantly, Philoponus assimilates the supposed rotational impetus implanted by God into\nthe celestial bodies to the rectilinear movements of the elements as\nwell as to the self-movements of animals. The interesting upshot is that all these different types of natural and non-natural motions are understood in essentially the same way as impetus- induced movements. In virtue of this bold suggestion Philoponus is often\ncredited with having envisaged, for the first time, a unified theory\nof dynamics, since he strove to give the same kind of explanation for\nphenomena that Aristotle and others had to explain by appeals to different kinetic principles such as nature, coercion, or soul, depending upon context.\n",
