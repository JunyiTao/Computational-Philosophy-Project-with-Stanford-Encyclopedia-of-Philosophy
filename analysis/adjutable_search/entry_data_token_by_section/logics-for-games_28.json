However, rationality\nalso describes a quality of behavior, related to how players act or\nwhat they take advantage of when deliberating about a game. The\nrelation between both perspectives can be made concrete when\ninterpreting game solution procedures as styles of pregame\ndeliberation. To follow is a dynamic analysis of Backward Induction\n(cf.\n Section 3.3)\n that differs conceptually from\n characterization theorems\n in terms of static properties such as common knowledge or common\nbelief. In the dynamic analysis, these group properties are not\nassumed as preconditions. Rather, they are produced through the logic\nof deliberation.\n\n4.1.1 Backward Induction via public announcement\n\nThe Backward Induction algorithm is usually presented in a\nquantitative setting, where each outcome is associated with utility\nvalues for all players. (Leyton-Brown and\nShoham 2008). However, the same algorithm also works in a\nqualitative setting, with attitudes expressed by a preference relation\nbetween outcomes.\n\nBackward Induction Backward Induction computes\noptimal moves for players. More specifically, at each choice node of\nan extensive form game, one or more of the available moves is labeled\nas optimal. For each player this set of optimal moves often forms a\nstrategy in the usual game-theoretic sense, i.e., a function selecting\na unique action to take at each of her choice nodes. Yet, there are\ndegenerate cases where backward induction merely creates a relational\nstrategy, restricting the available moves, while still leaving some\nchoices to the player.\n\nThe principle driving the Backward Induction algorithm is that no\nplayer should ever select a move that is dominated by another move\navailable at the same moment. Dominance here works in a recursive\nmanner. Move a dominates move b if the corresponding\nplayer prefers each final outcome reachable from a by following\nBackward Induction moves to every outcome reachable from b by\nBackward Induction moves.\n\nPublic announcement of rationality In one\nperspective, Backward Induction can be understood as a process of\nprior-to-play deliberation, executed by players whose minds proceed in\nharmony. Deliberation steps are repeated public announcements\n(\\(!\\rat\\)) of rationality-at-nodes:\n\n\\(\\rat \\)\nno player arrived at the current node via a strictly dominated\nmove \n\n\nDominance here is a relation between the outcomes available after a\ncertain move has been made. In one interpretation, some move a\ndominates another move b if every outcome that remains\nobtainable after a is preferred to any outcome reachable after\na b move. However, there is a dynamic twist: crucially, the\ngame tree considered, and hence the outcomes available, changes during\nthe deliberation procedure.\n\nThe semantics of\n announcement updates\n works by trimming models. \\(!\\varphi\\) transforms a model M\ninto a sub-model \\(M_{|\\varphi}\\) consisting of all those points in\nM that satisfy \\(\\varphi\\), while deleting all \\(\\neg\\varphi\\)\nnodes. Relations on \\(M_{|\\varphi}\\) are those inherited from\nM. Crucially, deletion may change the truth value of formulas:\nafter announcing \\(!\\varphi\\), some nodes in \\(M_{|\\varphi}\\) may\nsatisfy \\(\\neg\\varphi\\). In particular, with M the set of\npoints in a game tree, the set of available histories may keep\nshrinking as successive announcements are made. Hence, repeated\nannouncements of \\(!\\rat \\) make sense. In finite games, this process\nalways reaches a limit, a smallest subgame where no move is dominated\nby another.\n\nExample Solving games through iterated assertions of\nrationality.\n\nConsider the following game, already introduced in\n Section 1.1.\n Iterated announcements of \\(!\\rat \\) removes nodes that can only be\nreached by dominated moves as long as this can be done. The trace of\nthis procedure is:\n\n\n\nFigure 15.\n\u24d8\n\n\n\nHere, the Backward Induction solution emerges step by step. Stage 1 of\nthe procedure rules out the leaf labeled with (\\(2,2\\)) as the only\npoint where \\(\\rat \\) fails. Stage 2 then rules out E\u2019s\nchoice node as new node where \\(\\rat\\) fails. In the resulting game\ntree, \\(\\rat \\) holds throughout.\n\nMore generally, let \\((!\\varphi, M)^\\#\\) be the limit (i.e., the first\nfixed point) of M under repeatedly announcing \\(\\varphi\\) as\nlong as it still true. In any game tree, the fixed-point \\((!\\rat ,\nM)^\\#\\) has \\(\\rat\\) true throughout. Its nodes contain the actual\nplay computed by the Backward Induction algorithm (van\nBenthem 2014).\n\nLimit behavior Rationality is\n\u2018self-fulfilling\u2019 in the limit: if players commit to it in\ndeliberation for long enough, they prune away all irrational moves\nand, a fortiori, all moves incompatible with common belief of\nrationality. The final outcome is a model with rational play at every\npoint, a form of common knowledge of rationality. However, iterated\nannouncements can also yield a different type of limit behavior:\nself-refutation. A prime example for this is the classic Muddy\nChildren puzzle (Gierasimczuk & Szymanik\n2011) where repeatedly communicating ignorance leads to\nknowledge in the end. Also within game theory, a number of situations\nexist where (credible) announcements of future irrationality can leave\nsome player better off than the Backward Induction solution (Leyton-Brown\n& Shoham 2008). Limit\nbehavior of announcements in infinite games is studied in Baltag,\nBezhanishvili & Fern\u00e1ndez-Duque\n(2022), linking up with Cantor\u2019s derivative in classical\ntopology.\n\n4.1.2 Backward Induction via belief revision\n\nIterated belief revision. A different perspective of\npre-game deliberation is couched in terms of belief instead of\nknowledge. The driving force here is rationality-in-belief:\n\n\\(\\rat^*\\)\nplayers never chose any move dominated by another in light of\ntheir beliefs how play will proceed from then on.\n\n\nIn this setting, the game tree itself remains invariant during\ndeliberation: no histories are removed or ruled out. What may change\ninstead is the relative plausibility of occurrence players assign to\nend nodes or, in infinite games, histories.\n\nIn plausibility semantics (briefly introduced in\n Section 3.6),\n an agent believes propositions that hold true in all those\nepistemically accessible worlds that are maximal in her plausibility\norder. The corresponding dynamics of deliberation does not proceed by\npoint deletion, but by soft updates modifying the\nagents\u2019 plausibility ordering. For Backward Induction, a\n\u2018radical upgrade\u2019 \\(\\Uparrow\\varphi\\) suffices, that moves\nall \\(\\varphi\\)-worlds above all \\(\\neg\\varphi\\)-worlds states while\nmaintaining the ordering within these two sets (Baltag\n& Smets 2008).\n\nHere is how this mechanism works in a game setting. Start with all end\nnodes equiplausible for all players. Since upgrades proceed by public\nannouncement, all players will share the same beliefs throughout. In\nthe procedure to follow, a move x is dominated in\nbelief by a move y of the same choice node if, in the\nacting agent\u2019s plausibility ordering, the most plausible end\nnodes reachable after y are all better for her than each most\nplausible end node compatible with move x. Now perform radical\nupgrades of type\n\n\\(\\Uparrow\\rat^*\\)\nIf y is dominated in belief by x, make all end nodes\nfollowing x more plausible than those after\ny.\n\n\nExample Backward Induction, soft version.\n\nHere are the stages for the new procedure in the preceding example,\nwhere the letters \\(x, y, z\\) stand for end nodes or histories of the\ngame:\n\n\n\nFigure 16.\n\u24d8\n\n\n\nIn the top node of the leftmost tree, going right is not dominated in\nbeliefs for player A by going left. So, \\(\\rat ^*\\) only\naffects E\u2019s turn, and radical upgrade with \\(\\Uparrow\\rat\n^*\\) makes \\((0, 3)\\) more plausible than \\((2,2)\\) . After this\nchange, going right has become dominated in beliefs in the top node,\nand a new upgrade takes place, making A\u2019s going left most\nplausible.\n\nIterated upgrade with \\(\\rat ^*\\) always stabilizes to a fixed\nplausibility order, which is the same for all players. Identifying\neach history of a game with its end node allows for a belief analysis\nof Backward Induction (van Benthem &\nGheerbrant 2010). On finite trees, the histories emerging when\nall players resort to their Backward Induction strategies exactly\ncorrespond to the most plausible end nodes created by iterated radical\nupgrade with rationality-in-belief. An alternative dynamic-epistemic\ncharacterization of Backward Induction, using similar ideas in a\ndifferent mix, can be found in Baltag, Smets,\nand Zvesper (2009).\n\nStabilization cannot be taken for granted. For other assertions\n\\(\\varphi\\), iterated upgrades \\(\\Uparrow\\varphi\\) can lead to\noscillating or divergent plausibility orders. However, this divergence\nis limited. While cycles can occur for conditional beliefs, every\ntruthful iterated sequence of radical upgrades eventually stabilizes\nall propositional beliefs (Baltag & Smets\n2009).\n\nFixed-point logic In a more technical perspective,\nBackward Induction strategies can be defined as largest subrelation of\nthe total \\(\\move\\) relation that has at least one successor at each\nnon-terminal node, while satisfying a confluence property between\naction and preference:\n\n\\(CF(s)\\)\n\\(\\forall x\\forall y(( \\turn_i(x)\\land xsy)\\rightarrow\\forall z\n(x\\, \\move\\, z\\rightarrow\\) \\(\\exists u\\exists v(\\sfend(u)\\land\n\\sfend(v)\\land y s^* v\\land z s^* u\\land u\\leq_i v)))\\)\n\n\nThis fact is the basis for proving that Backward Induction is\ndefinable in First Order Fix point logic LFP(FFO) (van\nBenthem & Gheerbrant 2010). Results\nin this line of research connect game solution and game-theoretic\nequilibria with fixed-point logics of computation. In simple settings,\nsuch as that of Zermelo\u2019s Theorem mentioned earlier, modal\nfixed-point logics akin to \u03bc-calculus suffice.\n4.1.3 Iterated removal of strictly dominated strategies\n\nFurther game solution concepts can be analyzed with logics of iterated\nupdate. In particular, iterated updates are not restricted to\nextensive form games, but can also provide insights for games in\nstrategic form. A paradigmatic algorithm is Iterated Removal of\nStrictly Dominated Strategies \\((SD^\\infty)\\). In this setting, a\nstrategy is considered dominated if there exists another strategy that\nyields a strictly higher payoff against any of the opponent\u2019s\nactions.\n\nExample Iterated removal of strictly dominated\nstrategies \\((SD^\\infty)\\).\n\nConsider the following matrix. As usual, pairs list A\u2019s\nutility first, E\u2019s second.\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\n\na\nb\nc\n\nA\nd\n2, 3 \n2, 2\n1, 1\n\ne\n0, 2 \n4, 1 \n1, 0\n\nf\n0, 1 \n1, 4\n2, 0\n\n\nFirst remove the right-hand column, i.e., E\u2019s action\nc which is dominated by either of a and b. With\nc being removed, A\u2019s action f has become\nstrictly dominated. After its removal, E\u2019s action\nb becomes strictly dominated, and after that, A\u2019s\naction e. At the end of the process, iterated removal leaves\nnothing but the state \\((d,a)\\), the game\u2019s unique Nash\nequilibrium. In general, the resulting game matrix after all removals\nis guaranteed to contain all Nash equilibria of the original game, but\nit may also contain further strategy combinations.\n\nIn this setting, the formal dynamic apparatus involves assertions\nappropriate to the matrix games of\n Section 2.\n In fact, various different types of rationality can be defined in\nlogics for matrix games. Here is an illustration for two-player games,\ninvolving announcements of \u2018Weak Rationality\u2019:\n\nWR\nEach player thinks that, compared with each of her available\nalternative actions, her current move might be at least as good for\nher.\n\n\nThis statement is the negation, for each player, of her current action\nbeing strongly dominated. Naturally, this property can be expressed\nformally with suitable epistemic action modalities. Yet, even as it\nstands, it is clear that Weak Rationality can be announced to prune\naway strategy profiles, and that in a iterated manner. The strategic\ngame will change every time weak rationality is announced, initiating\na stepwise process that resembles the earlier iterative announcements\nof rationality for Backward Induction. As observed there, limits of\npublic announcements are always reached eventually, as models can only\nget smaller. For announcing Weak Rationality, these limits match the\noutcome of \\(SD^\\infty\\) precisely (van Benthem\n2007).\n\nA similar style of analysis can be extended to other notions of\nrationality. For instance, taking \\(B_i\\) to stand for \u2018the\ncurrent action of player i is best for her against all actions\nof the opponent\u2019, the following formula may be dubbed strong\nrationality SR \n\\[\\langle E\\rangle B_E\\land \\langle A\\rangle B_A\\]\n\n\nBriefly, the formula expresses that both players have a reasonable\nhope of doing well. Strong Rationality in this sense is\nrelated to the rationalizability program for game solution (Pearce\n1964; de Bruin 2005), where actions\nare discarded if a better response exists under all circumstances.\nStrong Rationality, too, drives a game solution method.\n\nExample Updates with iterated announcements of strong\nrationality (SR).\n\nConsider a slight variation on the previous example. Below is the\nsequence of updates for iterated announcements of strong rationality\n\\((\\textit{SR}^\\omega)\\)\n\n\n\n\n2, 3\n2, 2\n1, 1  \n\n\n0, 2\n 4, 1\n1, 0 \n\n1, 1\n 3, 4\n2, 0  \n\n\n\n\n2, 3\n2, 2  \n\n\n0, 2\n 4, 1 \n\n1, 1\n 3, 4  \n\n\n\n\n2, 3\n2, 2  \n\n\n0, 2\n 4, 1  \n\n\n\n\n2, 3  \n\n\n0, 2  \n\n\n\n\n2, 3  \n\n\n\nEach box may be viewed as an epistemic game model, as explained\nearlier. Again, every step of announcement increases players\u2019\nknowledge, until a fixed-point is reached, constituting an equilibrium\nwhere each player knows as much as they can.\n\nStrong rationality is a more demanding condition than weak\nrationality. While SR implies WR, there can be moves\nthat satisfy weak but not strong rationality. This shows in the\nfollowing difference between the current and the previous example. In\nthe present matrix, announcing Weak Rationality stops after the first\nstep elimination of action c. The reason is that, in the second\nmatrix, the row player\u2019s bottom move is not strictly dominated\nby any other action, so this row remains after re-announcing\nWR. However, under no possible circumstance is the row\nplayer\u2019s bottom action best for her. This contradicts strong\nrationality and hence that row is eliminated by the next SR\nannouncement. More generally, the game matrix resulting from\n\\((\\textit{SR})^\\infty\\) is a sub-matrix of that produced by\n\\((\\textit{WR})^\\infty\\). Notably, this is not entirely obvious, as\nthe two update sequences may produce different epistemic models\nsatisfying different formulas. A proof can be found in van\nBenthem (2014).\n\nJust as with Backward Induction, there are connections between\niterated announcements and fixed-point logics. The set of strategy\nprofiles that survive iterated announcements of strong rationality can\nbe defined in modal \u03bc-calculi (Kozen 1983;\nVenema 2008). If announcements are generalized to arbitrary\nformulas, so-called deflationary fixed-point logics are needed for\nstudying limit behavior (Ebbinghaus & Flum\n1995; Dawar, Gr\u00e4del, & Kreutzer 2004).\n\nFurther game solution concepts have been analyzed in a similar dynamic\nupdate style. The iterated regret minimization of Halpern\nand Pass (2012), for instance, has\nbeen captured in terms of iterated announcements (Cui\n& Luo 2013).\n\nIt should be noted, that there are also more deductive takes on\nsolution concepts, where successive inferences assume the role of the\nsemantic updates above. A systematic proof-theoretic perspective on\ngame-theoretic reasoning toward solution can be found in de\nBruin (2005). Lastly, alternative analyses\nof Strong and Weak Rationality as well as other game solution\nconcepts, in an abstract rewriting format of computational logic can\nbe found in Apt (2005).\n\nDigression: comparing across representation levels\nDifferent iterative announcement procedures lead to different analyses\nof games. Moreover when comparing various procedures across different\nframeworks, surprises may occur. For an illustration, take Backward\nInduction. Its dynamic analysis produced a new \u2018best move\u2019\nrelation or plausibility order on an extensive form game. The\nresulting strategy profiles may differ from a Nash equilibrium\nanalysis of the associated strategic form game:\n\nExample Backward Induction and Nash equilibria.\n\nConsider the following game. E has no preferences between any\noutcomes, but A does, as marked by the utility values.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.\n\u24d8\n\n\n\nIn the earlier BI analysis, neither move for A dominates the\nother in beliefs, so no move is eliminated. Now consider the two\npossible strategy profiles of each player and compute Nash\nequilibria:\n\n\n(Left, right) is not a Nash equilibrium, since A would\ndo better by playing Right, but (Left, left) is.\n\n\nThis illustrates differences in logical perspective on strategic and\nextensive form games. Primitive elements of the former, strategies,\nare complex objects in the latter\u2019s game tree that cannot be\nidentified completely at the level of individual nodes alone. A\nrelated point of connecting perspectives in classic game theory gave\nrise to the concept of subgame perfect Nash equilibria (Selten\n1975).\n\nFurther scenarios Casting game solution in terms of\ndeliberation renders it an internal mental process: normally opponents\ndo not sit down together to discuss their game play in advance, but\nreason about the opponents\u2019 possible actions and considerations.\nHowever, the deliberative techniques introduced above also apply to\nreal conversational scenarios. An example related to game theory is\nthe topic of disagreement, first introduced in an epistemic setting by\nAumann\u2019s 1976\nseminal agreeing to disagree result.\nD\u00e9gremont and Roy (2012)\ninvestigate this topic with techniques of dynamic logic, building on\nclassical results from Geanakoplos and\nPolemarchakis (1982). In this framework, any dialogue where\nagents keep stating whether or not they believe some formula\n\\(\\varphi\\) leads to agreement in the limit model, where updates no\nlonger have any effect. Briefly said, agents cannot disagree forever,\nat least when starting with different hard information, while sharing\na well-founded plausibility order.\n\n4.2 Information Flow, Knowledge, and Belief During Play\n\nGame play is a dynamic process, where players repeatedly obtain new\ninformation about other players. Certain aspects of information\ncollection are hard-wired into the game\u2019s structure, such as\nobserving moves, or, in settings of imperfect observation, changing\nfrom one information state to another. Other updates may be\nextraneous, such as signals about the type of opponent one is dealing\nwith. As of now, there is no general logical theory encompassing all\nthese phenomena. Yet, instructive samples exist. The first topic to\naddress concerns the players\u2019 knowledge, the second their\nbelief.\n4.2.1 Epistemic update and imperfect information\n\nIn one perspective, games annotated with imperfect information cells\ncan be interpreted as recording a process of actual play. However, an\nimperfect information tree does not suffice to fully specify the trace\nof a real game. This raises the question on how to tease out what has\nreally happened. One style of analysis involves techniques from\n dynamic-epistemic logic.\n In this approach, players are assumed to have perfect recall, they do\nnot forget anything they once knew, while also satisfying No Miracles:\nobservation of actual game play is their only source of information,\n(cf.\n Section 3.6).\n\nIn a first approximation, every move triggers a public announcement,\ninforming all players what just happened. Many games, however, include\npartially observable moves, where some players merely learn that an\nact has been performed, but not necessarily which. In this case,\ninformation processing requires product updates from\ndynamic-epistemic logic (cf. Baltag & Moss\n2004), allowing for an appropriate mixture of knowledge and\nuncertainty.\n\nExample Decorating a game tree by updates.\n\nThe left-hand side of the following diagram displays the game\u2019s\nbare action structure, without any information on observability.\nHowever, when moving, players can distinguish their own actions, but\nnot all moves of their opponents. Their precise observational powers\nare described by event models for the individual moves (cf.\nvan Ditmarsch, van der Hoek, & Kooi\n2007).\n\n\n\nFigure 18.\n\u24d8\n\n\n\nThe observational structure on possible moves is encoded by relations\nbetween the corresponding nodes, as described for games of imperfect\ninformation\n (Section 3.6).\n Here are the successive updates that create the uncertainty links in\nthe tree:\n\n\n\nFigure 19.\n\u24d8\n\n\n\nThe resulting annotated tree is the following imperfect information\ngame:\n\n\n\nFigure 20.\n\u24d8\n\n\n\nA similar analysis applies to infinite trees as well as to epistemic\nforests (cf.\n Section 3.6).\n More generally, any imperfect information structure can arise from\ninformation updates, provided players satisfy perfect recall and no\nmiracles, and moves in the game have logically definable preconditions\ngoverning their availability. Precise formulations and proofs can be\nfound in van Benthem, Gerbrandy, Hoshi, and\nPacuit (2009). A generalization to game play without assumption\nof synchronicity is provided in D\u00e9gremont,\nL\u00f6we, and Witzel\n(2011).\n\nNo miracles and perfect recall are typical assumptions for most types\nof agents in game theory. However, certain scenarios require\nmodifications, (cf. Osborne & Rubinstein\n1994 on the \u2018drunken driver\u2019 scenario). Moreover,\nif players are represented as finite automata, (cf.\n Section 3.8),\n perfect recall fails, and quite different patterns of uncertainty\nbecome possible. Characterizations results for memory-free and\nmemory-bounded players can be found in Liu\n(2011).\n\nIn addition to observational restrictions built into the game setup,\nproduct updates can also model extraneous communication or other\ninformation flow parallel to actual play. Some such scenarios will be\nlisted under Further Directions below.\n4.2.2 Belief revision and Forward Induction\n\nCertain types of information may be judged inconclusive or not fully\nreliable. While unsuitable for advancing knowledge, such information\nmay prompt agents to alter some of their beliefs. Such inconclusive\nevidence often concerns expectations concerning opponents\u2019\nplayer types. Leaving aside the possibility of mere mistakes, all\nmoves can be assumed to result from intentional, strategic\nconsiderations. By interpreting opponents\u2019 past moves, agents\nmay hence infer about their beliefs, preferences, risk attitudes or\nreasoning types. Naturally, most such observations are not fully\nconclusive. The corresponding updates hence cannot delete any\nalternatives. Rather, they merely change the agent\u2019s\nplausibility ordering \\(\\leq_i\\) among different options. Formally,\nthis can be handled with the plausibility updates introduced for\nBackward Induction. However, the interpretation differs. Here, these\nupdates do not represent steps in pregame deliberation, but result\nfrom actual moves during the game. Besides the radical upgrade\nintroduced above, a number of further updating policies reflecting\ndifferent attitudes to the information acquired are defined in Baltag\nand Smets (2008). The\nepistemic-plausibility patterns that can arise from systematic\nplausibility update in games have been identified in D\u00e9gremont\n(2010), using two\ncounterparts of the earlier perfect recall and no miracles properties:\n\u2018Plausibility Revelation\u2019 and \u2018Plausibility\nPropagation\u2019.\n\nThese results refer to but one aspect of belief in games. There are\nothers. A further type of belief describes agents prior attitudes to\nthe game, generated by past experience or deliberation. Another refers\nto the agents\u2019 beliefs about where they are located in the game\ntree, based on previous observations during play. To keep these\nnotions separate, one might distinguish between more local\n\u2018beliefs\u2019 during play and future-oriented\n\u2018expectations\u2019 about the game\u2019s progression.\nPlausibility orders created by Backward Induction, for instance,\ndescribe expectations about future game play. These are not based on\nobservations already made in the present game, and significantly, fail\nto satisfy the properties of plausibility revelation and propagation.\nHere is a particular strand of logical belief and its revision that is\nof independent game-theoretic interest.\n\nForward Induction Suppose some player has deviated\nfrom her Backward Induction strategy as computed in pre-game\ndeliberation. What are others to make of this? Answers offered in the\nliterature range from interpreting the deviation as an error without\nany future implications (Aumann 1995) to\ntreating it as significant in various ways (Bicchieri\n1993). In the latter vein, the\ndeviation could be a signal for cooperation (believable or not), a\nsign of limited resources, or it could reveal other relevant\ninformation about the player\u2019s type.\n\nMore explicitly, the situation has the following aspects. At any stage\nof a game, players have several types of information, including their\nprior expectations of how the game would proceed and the perhaps\nsurprising observations made along the way. If the game is to continue\nfurther, as in the state marked below, agents need to integrate both\ninto expectations about the future course of the game.\n\n\n\nFigure 21.\n\u24d8\n\n\n\nRationalizing There is no unique best way of\nintegrating information of the various kinds. Yet, a natural option is\nto maintain the assumption of opponents\u2019 rationality, taken in\nthe earlier sense. Assuming preferences to be common knowledge,\nobserved moves hence provide new information about the\nopponent\u2019s belief. More specifically, these beliefs have two\ncomponents: expectations about what other players will do, and\nintentions about their own future actions. The driving principle will\nthen be\n\nRationalizing\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By playing a\nmove, a rational player communicates that this move is not strictly\ndominated-in-beliefs for her.\n\nClearly, rationalizing can only be maintained as long as the player\ndoes not choose a move that is strictly dominated under all\ncircumstances. In that case, one must ascend a ladder of further\nhypotheses about the opponent, including the possibility of her making\nmistakes.\n\nReasoning policies of the above type are called Forward\nInduction. Battigalli and Siniscalchi (2002) and Brandenburger\n(2007), analyze Forward Induction in extensive form games based on its\nknown tight connection with Iterated Removal of Weakly Dominated\nStrategies in strategic form games. The following example involving\nexplicit reasoning is from Perea\n(2012).\n\nExample A Forward Induction scenario.\n\n\n\nFigure 22.\n\u24d8\n\n\n\nIn the matrix game, no move dominates any other. Hence E should\nconsider all outcomes possible. In this case, going left is\nsafer for her than going right, and hence A should\nplay Left at the start. However, if E rationalizes,\nand observes A going Right, she has extra information\navailable at her choice node. Following the rationality assumption,\nA expects to do better than 3, which is only possible if he\nintends to play Up in the matrix game. Now this tells\nE to proceed to the matrix and play the left column\ntherein. E\u2019s results in a better payoff than the 2 of her\noriginal safe option.\n\nFrom a logical perspective, a study of Forward Induction requires\nepistemic-doxastic models with ternary world-dependent plausibility\nrelations, combined with the public announcement updates or\nplausibility upgrade described above (Section 4.1.2;\n see. also van Benthem 2014). No definitive logical analysis of\nForward Induction has been published so far.\n4.2.3 Post-game rationalization\n\nComparatively little attention has been paid in the literature to what\nplayers do after a game. Yet, these follow up-activities are often\ncrucial, for instance to establish general lessons learned that may be\nvaluable for future game play. Such interpretations are especially\nprominent in small or isolated groups, where the same opponent might\nbe encountered again in the future.\n\nPreference change after a game At a simple level,\npost-game activity can consist in setting, or altering, the second\ninput parameter of rational choice beside belief: the players\u2019\npreferences. Several folklore results relate to this option. For\ninstance, when playing against a given strategy of another player with\nknown preferences, any strategy can be rationalized by choosing\nsuitable preferences among outcomes. Liu\n(2011) discusses several preference based rationalization\nalgorithms using dynamic logics of preference change.\n\nPreference change can also occur during a game. Players may receive\nnew information about the game\u2019s end states and their\nproperties. They may also follow a command or a suggestion from an\nauthority, establishing a preference or reversing an earlier one.\nRelatedly, players may change their external goals pursued in the\ngame, or they may adjust their preferences for more internal reasons,\nas in the phenomenon of \u2018sour grapes\u2019 (Elster\n1983).\n\n4.2.4 Play in a long-term temporal perspective\n\nThe main focus of this section is the local dynamics of what happens\nbefore, during and after a single game. There is also a broader\nperspective of time, in which all these activities are embedded in an\nextended temporal universe, large enough to include all possible\ntrajectories of the game, finite or just as well infinite. In\n evolutionary game theory,\n in particular, infinite games typically arise from iterated play of\nfinite games, with Lewis\u2019\nsignaling games (2002) as prominent\nexample in philosophy.\n\nAssuming an extended infinite temporal perspective raises additional\nquestions about players\u2019 strategic foresight and adaptation\n(Christoff 2016). Various long-term\nperspectives differ drastically in this respect, ranging from the\nminimal rationality assumptions typical of evolutionary game theory to\nhigh reasoning complexities of agents anticipating the long term\neffects of their choices.\n\nTemporal logics While infinite game forms were\nbriefly alluded to in\n Section 2.10,\n infinite play focuses on agency over time. A host of temporal logics\nfor this end have been put forward, including interpreted systems\n(Fagin, Halpern et al. 1995),\nepistemic-temporal logic (Parikh &\nRamanujam 2003), STIT (Belnap &\nPerloff 1988; Horty & Belnap 1995), ATL (Alur,\nHenzinger, & Kupferman 2002; van der Hoek\n& Wooldridge 2003), and others. Many of these systems\ncombine multiple modalities. Consequentially, their complexity can be\nvery high (undecidable, non-axiomatizable, or even non-arithmetical),\nas Halpern & Vardi (1986) show in a\npioneering study for the case of combining time and knowledge.\nSurveying this area is beyond the scope of this entry, cf. the entry\non\n temporal logics.\n A unifying view of connections between the various paradigms is\npresented in van Benthem and Pacuit\n(2006).\n\n\n\nFigure 23.\n\u24d8\n\n\n\nJust as with finite games, players\u2019 preferences must be\nspecified for studying equilibria in potentially infinite games. In\nlack of outcome nodes or final moments to attach preferences to, these\nare naturally thought of in terms of players\u2019 goals, expressed\nas properties the game\u2019s histories should satisfy. Such goals\ncan be local propositional facts true at some particular moment. But\ngoals can also concern global properties of histories such as avoiding\nor reaching the same position some specified number of times, or more\nabstractly, achieving safety or fairness in some appropriate sense.\nAll such properties can be specified in temporal logics. For the case\nof Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), the \u2018Boolean\ngames\u2019 of Gutierrez, Harrenstein, and\nWooldridge (2015) have developed the temporal goal based\napproach in depth. Notably, this framework validates a logical version\nof the \u2018folk theorem\u2019 for iterated games, cf. Osborne\n& Rubinstein (1994): Under natural\nconditions on goals, iterated games can have novel equilibria not\nsupervenient on the base game\u2019s Nash equilibria. Further\nsignificant uses of temporal logics connect game theory with belief\nrevision theory (Battigalli & Bonanno 1999;\nPerea 2012; Stalnaker 1998).\n\nEvolutionary game theory and dynamical systems A\nprominent application of iterated games occurs in evolutionary game\ntheory (Maynard Smith 1982; Hofbauer &\nSigmund 1998; Gintis 2000), a framework that has many\napplications in biology, formal sociology, but also linguistics and\nphilosophy (Lewis 2002; Skyrms 2010; Alexander\n2007; Clark 2012).\n\nLittle work has been done so far on the logical analysis of\nevolutionary games along the dimensions of this entry. In fact, there\nare striking conceptual differences between evolutionary games and the\nstyle of analysis pursued here that might be dubbed \u2018high\nrationality\u2019-oriented. Rather than incorporating intentional,\nstrategic actors, evolutionary games work by temporal progression of a\ndynamical system which is driven by individuals\u2019 fitness values\nderived from game-like encounters with others. Within such systems,\nbehavior is not driven by belief updates or complex strategic\nconsiderations. Rather, players typically display \u2018low\nrationality, following certain hard-wired strategies. Much of the\nevolutionary system\u2019s dynamics is then driven by changes in the\npopulation\u2019s composition of strategy types.\n\nEven so, evolutionary game theory does invite connections to logic.\nThe evolutionary success of simple strategies like Tit-for-Tat (Axelrod\n& Hamilton 1981) raises the\nquestion of just when complex logically based high-rationality\nstrategies can be replaced by equally efficient alternatives simple\nenough to be played by automata or similar models of bounded agents,\n(Gr\u00e4del, Thomas, & Wilke 2002).\nAt a higher level of abstraction, there also is an incipient line of\nresearch into the connection between logic and dynamical systems, a\nstandard tool for analyzing evolutionary games. This strand includes a\nbimodal topological logic of time (Kremer &\nMints 2007), fixed-point logics of oscillation (van\nBenthem 2015), and a systematic linkage\nbetween dynamic-epistemic update logics and dynamical systems over\nmetric spaces (Klein & Rendsvig\n2019; 2020). At a much concreter level, one important species of\nevolutionary games are signaling games (Lewis\n2002; Cho & Kreps 1987; Osborne & Rubinstein 1994; Skyrms\n2010: van Rooy 2004), where agents send and receive signals\nabout the state of the world. Signaling games match up naturally with\nthe earlier dynamics logic of information flow during play.\n\n\n4.3 Conclusion: Theory of Play\n\nTopics discussed in this section are less standard in the literature\nthan those of the sections before. In an orthodox reading, various of\nthe aspects addressed would not be considered part of game theory\nproper. The extended agenda followed here has been embraced by van\nBenthem, Pacuit, and Roy (2011) as a\nlarger program for logic, going under the heading \u2018Theory of\nPlay\u2019. The underlying line of reasoning is that games do not\nfully determine their outcomes, as they allow for various styles of\nplay. Hence, it might be the process of play itself, including\nplayers\u2019 types and how they change over time, that might the\nbest focus for understanding interaction, rather than mere games or\ngame forms alone. Similar lines of argument can be found in the\nfoundations of computation where it has been proposed that the\nessential topic of study should be behavior (Abramsky\n2008).\n\n4.4 Further Directions\n\nBelief revision and learning theory Belief revision\nin repeated games bears natural resemblance to limit learning of\n formal learning theory\n (Kelly 1996). Baltag,\nGierasimczuk, and Smets (2011) analyze\nlearning in terms of initial epistemic-doxastic models over which\nfinite histories of signals trigger the learner to revise beliefs,\nrepresented as changes in epistemic accessibility or plausibility\norder. It turns out that both iterated public announcement and\niterated radical upgrade as discussed above are universal learning\nmethods, though only the latter maintains this property in the\npresence of (finitely many) errors in the input stream.\n\nGoal dynamics and intentions While preferences and\ngoals have so far been assumed fixed and universally known, this is by\nno means necessary. van Otterloo (2005)\npresents a dynamic logic of strategic powers, where information about\nplayers\u2019 intentions and preferences can be announced during\nplay. Roy (2008) uses announcements of\nintentions to obtain simplified solution procedures for strategic\ngames. More concrete scenarios of extraneous information flow are\nfound in Parikh, Ta\u015fdem\u0131\u0307r, and\nWitzel (2013), where agents manipulate the knowledge of others\nduring play.\n\nGame change In many real life scenarios, players do\nnot know the full game tree they are playing. Even if they did, it\nmight change during play. Or, at least, players may attempt to change\nthe game. A concrete example is provided by the game tree in\n Section 4.1.1.\n There, the inefficient Backward induction outcome \\((1, 0)\\) could be\navoided by E promising not to go left. When made binding (for\ninstance through imposing a fine) this announcement eliminates\nhistories and, consequentially, a new backward Induction outcome of\n\\((2,2)\\) results. Hence, both players can be made better off by\nrestricting the freedom of one. Game theory has sophisticated analyses\nof such scenarios, including an analysis of \u2018cheap talk\u2019\n(Osborne & Rubinstein 1994), asking\nwhen such announcements are credible. On the logical side, this\nsuggests an analysis of signaling games (van\nRooy 2004). We are not aware of any logical work done in this\ndirection.\n\nReal games The discrepancy between specification of a\ngame and the realities of play is especially striking in real game\nplay, either of the \u2018natural kind\u2019 in common parlor games\n(van Ditmarsch & Kooi 2015), or of\nthe artificial kind found in the laboratory experiments of\nexperimental game theory (Camerer 2003).\nLittle work has been done by logicians in this realm, though there is\na broad tradition of computational analysis of games (Schaeffer\n& van der Herik 2002; Kurzen\n2011). Any adequate logical analysis would clearly need to\nincorporate the considerations on bounded agency discussed in\n Section 3.\n\nMathematical foundations Logic of play as discussed\nhere raises issues of how to interfaces local with global dynamics.\nThis shows in particular with logical limit behavior, where\nobservations and assertions are made repeatedly. Limit models of\npublic announcement, as described earlier, can be\n\u2018self-fulfilling\u2019 or \u2019self-refuting\u2019. In the\nfirst case, the property asserted becomes common knowledge among all\nagents, whereas in the second it eventually becomes false at the\nactual world. With soft update on plausibility models, a third option\narises, namely, infinite oscillation, or even divergence (Baltag\n& Smets 2009). To date, there is\nno general logical theory of these phenomena, but see van\nBenthem (2011) on the use of fixed-point\nlogics for limit models, Miller and Moss\n(2005) on the high complexity of public announcement logic with\nfinitely iterated announcements, and Klein and\nRendsvig (2017) on limit behavior of product updates.\n\nThe topic of limit behavior also raises the issue of how local dynamic\nlogics of agency relate to the global temporal logics discussed in\n Section 4.2.4.\n Towards clarifying the connection, van\nBenthem, Gerbrandy, Hoshi, and Pacuit (2009), show how\ndynamic-epistemic logics can be seen as decidable fragments of more\nexpressive temporal logics. Baltag, Smets, and\nZvesper (2009) discuss the related theme of how dynamic\nrepresentations can decrease complexity by shifting information from\nthe temporal universe to dynamic events.\n\n\n\n5. Interfacing Logic and Probability in Games\n\nProbabilities are central to game theory, where they serve two\nprominent roles. First, they structure players\u2019 uncertainty\nabout various aspects of the game, including the state of nature, the\ntype of opponent faced, and past, present, and future moves of other\nplayers. Second, ever since the origins of Game Theory (von\nNeumann & Morgenstern 1944),\nprobabilistic randomization has served to expand the agents\u2019\nspace of possible actions. While the interpretation of such mixed\nstrategies has been the subject of extensive debate (Sugden\n1991), it is uncontroversial that\nrandomized moves add significant depth to the analysis of games. In\nfact, the concept of mixed strategies is vital for a number of seminal\nresults in classic game theory including the existence of Nash\nequilibria in finite games of imperfect information.\n\nProbability and its logic is a major topic in both mathematics and\nphilosophy, as discussed in the entries on\n interpretations of probability,\n and\n logic and probability.\n The current section merely outlines a few key connections between\nprobability and the logical analysis of games. The following\npresentation assumes all state spaces to be finite, ignoring important\ntechnical and conceptual issues around the transition from finite to\ninfinite state spaces.\n5.1 Probabilities and Beliefs\n\nProbabilistic methods are widely employed to represent beliefs of\nagents within and outside of games, witness\n Bayesian epistemology.\n Typically, a probabilistic belief model consists of two components: a\nspace of possible states that the agent\u2019s beliefs range over,\nplus a quantitative probability function denoting how probable the\nagent judges different propositions or states to be. In qualitative\nlogical models, on the other hand, agentive belief is represented in\nvarying degree of detail. The coarsest approach only distinguishes\nstates the agent considers possible from those she rules out. This is\nthe perspective of standard epistemic-doxastic logics, such as\nmulti-agent S5 and KD45 discussed in\n Section 3.6.\n More fine-grained perspectives are employed in the plausibility\nmodels of Boutilier (1994) and Baltag\nand Smets (2008), where the range of\nepistemic options is structured further by plausibility orderings\nencoding which options agents take to be less or more likely. See also\nSections\n 3.6.4\n and\n 4.2.\n\nBoth probabilistic and plausibilistic perspectives can express that\nsome alternative is more likely than another. However, there are also\nconceptual differences between the two frameworks. Probabilistic\nmodels can aggregate, allowing their logic to express, for instance,\nwhether many low-probability events combined can outweigh even the\nhighest-probability worlds. Aggregated probabilities play a key role,\nfor instance, in calculations of expected utility. Yet no such thing\ncan be expressed in plausibility semantics. For another striking\ndifference, plausibility models lead to a notion of belief that is\nclosed under conjunction. This conjunction closure typically fails for\nprobabilistic accounts of belief. See however Leitgeb\n(2017) for a sophisticated bridge\nbetween both types of modeling. \n5.2 From Logic to Probability and Back\n\nOn a received view, logical and probabilistic frameworks emphasize\ndifferent aspects of belief. Logic emphasizes coherence properties\nbetween the propositions believed, such as closure under logical\nimplications or conjunction. Probabilistic reasoning, on the other\nhand, stresses graded information and attitudes towards uncertain\nevents such as lotteries. Even so, there is a variety of approaches\nattempting to unify the two types of reasoning by constructing bridges\nbetween the frameworks.\n\nFrom qualitative to quantitative probability Early\nattempts in this direction go back to Finetti\n(1970 [1974]), striving for a purely qualitative axiomatization\nof probability theory. A step further towards logical reasoning are\nvarious theories of qualitative probability (Kyburg\n1994), often based on the assumption\nthat classical quantitative notions of probability are too demanding\nfor real-life agents. In this line of research agents need only reason\nwith partial, comparative probability assessments, rather than having\nfully specified probabilities for all events. Logical frameworks for\nqualitative probability include Segerberg\n(1971), Fagin, Halpern, and Megiddo (1990), and Delgrande\nand Renne (2015). While differing in\ndetail, all logics in this line have in common that they allow for\nexpressions of the form \\(\\varphi\\preceq\\psi\\), indicating that\n\\(\\psi\\) is judged at least as probable at \\(\\varphi\\). Recent\nframeworks add various additional refinements to this language.\nSimilarly, Heifetz and Mongin (2001)\nexpand the axiomatic analysis of probabilistic beliefs to higher order\nreasoning, working on probabilistic type space akin to those\nintroduced in\n Section 3.7.\n\nYet, the concept of qualitative probability is sometimes considered\nflawed: a complete set of probabilistic-logical principles\nguaranteeing that every complete description in the logical language\ncorresponds to a unique probability measure turns out to require a\ncomplex calculus, involving an opaque infinite rule (Kraft,\nPratt, & Seidenberg 1959; Scott\n1964). A new angle has been proposed in Harrison-Trainor,\nHolliday, and Icard (2016) and\nDing, Holliday, and Icard (2021)  through axiomatizing a\nlow-complexity qualitative probabilistic logic that emerges from\nrelaxing the above unique correspondence requirement to merely\nrequiring compatibility with all probability measures of a certain\nfamily.\n\nHowever, none of the frameworks described here are specific for games.\nIn fact, it remains to be seen whether qualitative probabilistic\nlogics, old or recent, can be used for a qualitative analysis of\ngame-theoretic solution concepts.\n\nFrom quantitative to qualitative probability While\nthe preceding line of research aims at recovering quantitative\nprobability from qualitative notions, a converse project shows how\nubiquitous qualitative patterns might arise naturally within a\nquantitative probabilistic setting. Building on what is sometimes\ndubbed the Lockean Thesis, threshold approaches connect\nprobability to logic by stipulating that some \\(\\varphi\\) is to be\nbelieved simpliciter if the probability of \\(\\varphi\\) is above some\nappropriate numerical threshold t. For most choices of\nthreshold t, such translations do not square well with standard\nlogical desiderata, as beliefs will in general not be closed under\nconjunction. However, in recent work Leitgeb\n(2017) and Lin and Kelly (2012)\nhave identified conditions under which one can do better. Building on\nideas of Skyrms (1977), Leitgeb\nidentifies strong, context-dependent\n\u2018robustness conditions\u2019 on thresholds that guarantee the\ndefined belief operator to satisfy the KD45 axioms after all. Lin\nand Kelly, on the other hand, work with\nnon-uniform thresholds for transitioning between logical and\nprobabilistic notions of belief, allowing to derive coherence between\ndifferent forms of belief dynamics on the two sides. For a recent\nstudy of the mathematical foundations and limits of these approaches,\nas well as the conditional logics they generate see Mierzewski\n(2020).\n5.3 Updating and Tracking Probabilities\n\nIn the dynamic perspective of game play, every move constitutes a new\npiece of information agents have to take into account. Besides,\nplayers may also change their beliefs about the game upon\ndeliberation, through communication or any other signals they receive,\nbe they reliable or not ( cf.\n Section 4).\n All such dynamic events raise the question of how new information is\nto be incorporated into the agents\u2019 beliefs and when\nprobabilistic updates have corresponding logical revisions or vice\nversa.\n\nIf the new information is of the hard type, accepted as irrevocably\ntrue by all agents, the probabilistic counterpart of logical public\nannouncements is Bayesian conditioning. Both notions track each other\nat a semantic level, meaning that their outputs amount to the same\nthing. Computing beliefs after a public announcement means recomputing\nin the submodel consisting of all states where the information\nreceived was true. This is exactly the same mechanism as for\nrecalculating probabilities in Bayesian update. Moreover, for\nreasoning about updates, both approaches require conditional notions:\nconditional belief and conditional probability respectively. The\nquantitative notion of conditional belief relates to the logical\nnotion of conditional belief \\(B(\\varphi|\\psi)\\), with the slight\ncaveat that the latter also allows for epistemic or doxastic operators\ninside either argument. More refined logical notions of conditional\nbelief arise in the earlier-mentioned plausibility semantics of\n Section 4.1.2,\n (Baltag & Smets 2008).\n\nGiven the co-existence of qualitative and quantitative perspectives,\nit makes sense to ask whether one can track the other. In a\nstatic sense, tracking asks whether different notions of belief can be\ntranslated into each other by omitting or transforming some of the\nsemantic details involved. A dynamic interpretation expands on this by\nasking whether updating, either in the hard or soft varieties of\n Section 4,\n is compatible with these translations in a commutative diagram:\nInformation update in a new perspective after translation should yield\nsame result as first performing a matching update in the old\nperspective and then translating (van Benthem\n2016). In games, the topic of tracking may refer not just to\ninformation update, but also to solution concepts or moves in game\nplay described at the various levels considered in\n Section 2.\n\nThe existence of tracking maps depends on the exact type of update\nconsidered. By now there is a wide variety of updating policies on\nplausibility models (van Benthem & Smets\n2015), not all of which have obvious probabilistic\ncounterparts. Likewise, for well-known varieties of probabilistic\nupdate, such as Jeffrey update, where the probability of selected\npropositions can be reset at will, plausibility counterparts are not\neasy to find, though the attempt of van\nBenthem, Gerbrandy, and Kooi (2009) modifies dynamic-epistemic\nlogic to allow for Jeffrey update and other generalized probabilistic\npolicies.\n5.4 Specializing to Games\n\nVirtually all aspects of game theory provide contacts between logical\nand probabilistic perspectives. Clearly, this is true for the\ndifferent representations of knowledge, beliefs and their dynamics\njust discussed. Other contacts occur at the level of game forms, cf.\n Section 2,\n where probabilities enrich the space of strategies. The resulting\nmixed moves require players to expand their preferences to mixed\noutcomes, cf.\n Section 3.\n Finally, at the level of reasoning about game play, cf.\n Section 4,\n probabilistic beliefs play a role in solution techniques such as\ndominance or expected utility based reasoning.\n\nAvailable actions and mixed strategies Probabilistic\nmixtures of pure strategies are prominent in game theory, as they can\nsecure outcomes and payoffs that no pure strategy alone could\nguarantee.\n\nExample Matching Pennies.\n\nConsider the well-known game of matching pennies in matrix form:\n\n\n\n\nBob\n\n\n\nx\ny\n\nAnn\na\n1,\u22121 \n\u22121, 1\n\nb\n\u22121,1\n1,\u22121\n\n\nFor Ann, a mixed strategy of playing a exactly half of the time\nguarantees an expected outcome of 0, no matter what Bob does. No pure\nstrategy could have achieved this.\n\nFrom a logical point of view, mixed strategies can be conceptualized\nas new primitive actions in the earlier logics of games ( cf.\n Section 2).\n Yet, this treatment immediately renders the set of available actions\ninfinite. A cautiously refined logical language, extending logical\napproaches to qualitative probability, can allow for expressions such\nas an agent playing action a with probability at least\nq, (Delgrande and Renne\n2015).\n\nA more challenging general question is how to relate classic\nprobabilistic approaches with their fixed-point results and ensuing\nequilibrium existence theorems, with the logical fixed-point\napproaches mentioned at several places in this entry. The latter\noperate with step-by-step ordinal iterations, as opposed to the\ngradual, approximative procedures that underlie the Brouwer or\nKakutani fixed-point theorems relevant for classical game theory. A\nrelated question is just how much logic is needed to reproduce\nprobabilistic existence theorems within a qualitative framework.\n\nAdding players\u2019 preferences Once preferences\nare added, mixed strategies trigger additional intricacies. A strategy\nprofile where some players pursue mixed strategies does not produce a\nunique outcome, but a weighted combination of outcomes. Thus,\npermitting mixed strategies requires lifting preference relations to\nprobabilistic mixtures of outcomes or strategy profiles. Incorporating\nsuch mixtures may implicitly depart from the standard, purely\nqualitative perspective on outcomes (Ramsey\n1931; Savage 1954).\n\nExample Extended preference comparison.\n\nThe following two games are equivalent in terms of qualitative (i.e.,\nordinal) preferences between outcomes for both players. However, they\ndiffer in preferences between mixed outcomes, with  \n\\[0.5(b,x)+0.5(b,y)\\succeq_A (a,x)\\]\n\n\nholding in the game to the left, but not in that to the right.\n\n\n\n\n\nx\ny \n\na\n1,0\n2,1 \n\nb\n0,1\n4,0  \n\n\n\n\n\nx\ny \n\na\n1,0\n2,1 \n\nb\n\u221210,1\n4,0  \n\n\n\nGoing this way poses some logical challenges. For example, consider a\npreference relation over probabilistic mixtures of outcomes, where\n\\(m^t(a,b)\\) stands for obtaining a with a probability of\nt, and b otherwise. This setting is in the scope of\nvon Neumann and Morgenstern\u2019s\n1944 well-known \u2018continuity\naxiom\u2019 that is characterized by an implicit infinite\ndisjunction:  \n\\[ {a \\preceq b\\preceq c} \\Rightarrow  {\\exists t \\in(0,1):\\ m^t(a,c)\\preceq b \\preceq  m^{1-t}(a,c)} \\]\n\n\nThis seems well beyond the expressive power of standard probabilistic\nlogics.\n\nSolution concepts and game play Probabilization also\nimpact the process of game play and its reasoning dynamics, for\ninstance by changing the earlier-mentioned calculus of weak and strong\ndominance\n (Section 3.4).\n Consider the following game, cf. de Bruin\n(2005):\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\n\nx\ny\n\nA\na\n0, 5 \n5, 0\n\nb\n5, 0 \n0, 5 \n\nc\n1, 1 \n1, 1\n\n\nNone of A\u2019s strategies are dominated in terms of pure\nstrategies. However, in terms of expected outcomes, c is\ndominated by an equal mixture of a and b. Thus, solution\nprocedures analyzed earlier such as iterated removal of weakly or\nstrongly dominated strategies may provide different and incompatible\noutcomes, depending on whether mixed strategies are considered or not.\nNo satisfactory logical analysis of the earlier kind seems to exist\nfor this setting.\n5.5 Further Challenges for a Logical Approach\n\nFurther challenges to the interplay of logic and probabilistic\nreasoning abound. By way of conclusion, here is a dimension that seems\nhard to capture in purely qualitative logical terms. A characteristic\nfeature of game- and decision-theoretic reasoning is that beliefs and\npreferences are entangled in various ways (Liu\n2011). For instance, the crucial notion\nof expected utility entangles probability, representing beliefs, with\nutilities, standing for preferences. Players faced with probabilistic\nuncertainty about the opponent\u2019s present and future actions are\noften advised to maximize expected utility (von\nNeumann & Morgenstern 1944; Savage 1954). Hence, even if\none has found qualitative counterparts for probabilistic belief and\ncardinal utility separately, entanglement poses the additional\ndifficulty of merging these two qualitative analyses in a way that\nmatches what the quantitative side achieves easily by forming some\narithmetical combination of both components.\n\n\n6. Gamification\n\nThe main topic of this entry is a logical approach to game theory,\nbringing classical notions and methods from logic to bear upon games.\nThis project is sometimes called \u2018logic of games\u2019. There\nalso is a converse direction of \u2018logic as games\u2019, where\ngame theoretic concepts are employed to elucidate basic notions of\nlogic. This section presents a brief discussion on this direction as a\nnatural counterpoint to the main lines of the entry. For an extensive\nsurvey see the entries on\n logic and games\n and\n games, abstraction and completeness.\n\n6.1 Logic Games\n\nMany notions in logic have been analyzed in game-theoretic terms\n\nEvaluation games There are well-known two-player\ngames for evaluating a first-order formula \\(\\varphi\\) within a given\nlogical model. These games are played between Verifier and Falsifier,\nwho can both test atomic assertions, and specify the value of\nvariables from a given domain (Hintikka\n1973). The schedule of the game is determined from the\nsyntactic structure of the formula \\(\\varphi\\). Disjunctions and\nexistential quantifiers require choices of the Verifier, conjunctions\nand universal quantifiers of the Falsifier, and negations trigger a\nrole switch between the two players. The result is the following match\nbetween winning strategies and the ordinary semantic notion of\ntruth:\n\n\nFormula \\(\\varphi\\) is true in model M under assignment\ns iff the Verifier has a winning strategy in the associated\ngame \\(game(M, s, \\varphi)\\). \n\n\nCorrespondingly, Falsifier has a winning strategy if the formula\n\\(\\varphi\\) is false in the model. Evaluation games turn out to be an\nextremely flexible tool. By suitably modulating rules and winning\nconventions, adequate evaluation games can be found for most logical\nsystems. Doing so, however, can be a highly non-trivial task, as\nwitnessed by the intricate infinite \u2018parity games\u2019\ncorresponding to fixed-point logics such as the modal \u03bc-calculus\n(Venema 2008). For the present purpose,\nit should be noted that this style of analysis ties the very logical\noperations, conjunctions, disjunctions, modal operators, to natural\nmoves in a game. Similarly, the notion of truth is linked to the\nfundamental game-theoretic notion of a strategy in an extensive form\ngame (cf.\n Section 2):\n a complex, structured object which may here be understood as a reason\nor an explanation for the truth or falsity of the formula.\n\nThe links between both perspectives are so close, that valid\nprinciples of logic come to express game-theoretic facts. For\ninstance, after a little analysis, the law of excluded middle implies\nthat always either Verifier or Falsifier has a winning strategy, cf.\n Section 2.4.\n In other words, logical evaluation games for classical logic are\ndetermined in the game-theoretic sense. In fact, This property extends\nto most games for non-classical logics.\n\nFurther logic games Logic games exist for many other\npurposes. Ehrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 games serve model comparison\n(Ehrenfeucht 1961; Ebbinghaus & Flum\n1995), Lorenzen games perform proof analysis (Kamlah\n1973 [1984]) and tableau games execute\nmodel construction (Hodges 1985). In\neach case, strategies in the game match important logical notions. In\nLorenzen dialogue games, for instance, winning strategies for the\nProponent of a claim correspond to proofs of that claim from premises\ngranted by the Opponent, whereas winning strategies for the Opponent\nare constructions of counter-models. Thus, proofs and models, two\nquite distinct notions in logic, co-exist within a single game.\n\nThere exists an alternative, game-theoretic way of interpreting these\nconnective results. Suppose the game under study is fixed, and\nassociated with some sort of \u2018game board\u2019 representing\nmajor features of the game\u2019s general state (think of Chess,\nthough more abstract game boards may occur). Then the above\nequivalences suggest that winning strategies, i.e., a typical\ngame-theoretic notion defined in terms of the complete extensive game\ntree, is equivalent to a simpler \u2018invariant\u2019 that can be\ndefined entirely in terms of some game board associated with the\ntree\u2019s nodes. Identifying useful such invariants is a well-known\nart in the analysis of concrete games. In terms of a main theme of\nthis entry, invariants can live at different levels of representation\nassociated with a given class of games.\n\nGame semantics One can view logic games as mere\ndidactic devices analyzing logical notions that were already\nwell-understood. Or, in other terms, as offering a concrete way of\nteaching logic that draws on game-theoretic intuitions. However, logic\ngames have more to offer. First of all, new logics are suggested by\npursuing natural variations in winning conventions, moves, or\nscheduling within existing logic games. Moreover, viewing logical\noperations as game constructors suggests a new, refined view on\nlogical constants. Conjunction, for instance, now splits naturally\ninto a sequential and a parallel version. Similar examples of\nparallelism also exist in logics of computation. Moreover, associating\nquantifiers with object picking, as in evaluation games, turns\nquantifiers into special types of atomic games that connect to the\nfollowing formula by an abstract operation of game composition. The\ngeneral logic of this abstract composition operation combined with\npropositional operations of choice and switch has been shown\ndecidable, providing a new decidable core logic inside first-order\nlogic whose existence had not been suspected (van\nBenthem 2014). Games, hence, can offer a\nfresh perspective on existing logical systems.\n\nA major source of independent, game-theoretic perspectives on logic is\nthe game semantics of computational logics (Abramsky\n1997). In this setting, the status\nof logic games may change. Rather than being a mere pedagogical or\nexploratory device, to some, these games are considered the true\nmeaning of logical constants. In this setting, infinite games are\noften the paradigm, standing for ongoing processes, rather than finite\nterminating games. This shows in the importance of infinite parity\ngames for the modal \u03bc-calculus, Venema\n(2008), as well as in the earlier-mentioned co-algebraic\nperspective on games. Baltag, van Benthem &\nWesterst\u00e5hl (forthcoming) discuss the outside-in\nperspective of co-algebraic game semantics as a viable general\nparadigm for linguistic meaning representing a significant shift in\nstandard discussions of compositionality.\n\n6.2 Other Logic-Related Games\n\nThe distinction between game logics and logic games is not always\nsharp. Recent literature has seen a number of games whose design is\nconnected to logic, yet they are not meant to analyze logical notions\nper se. Many of these games are played on graphs, as underlying game\nboards where players can perform different moves. Graph games are\nwidely used in the computational literature for analyzing logical and\nalgorithmic tasks ( Flum, Gr\u00e4del &\nWilke 2007). However, in this section, we merely highlight one\nparticular kind of graph game for its fruitful connections with logic\nwhich suggests a number of unusual issues.\n\nExample Sabotage Games.\n\nSabotage games were proposed to analyze algorithmic tasks in adverse\ncircumstances. Consider the below network between some European\ncities:\n\n\n\nFigure 24.\n\u24d8\n\n\n\nIt is easy to travel either way between Amsterdam and the German town\nof Saarbruecken. Now, let a malevolent Demon start canceling\nconnections in the network. At every stage, let the Demon take out one\nlink, while the Traveler can afterwards follow one of the remaining\nlinks. This turns a one-agent planning problem into a two-player\nsabotage game. Zermelo-style reasoning shows that, from Saarbruecken,\na German Traveler still has a winning strategy, while in Amsterdam,\nthe Demon has the winning strategy against the Dutch Traveler, by\nfirst cutting a link close to Saarbruecken. The symmetry of the\noriginal search problem is broken.\n\nThe sabotage game has been applied to a variety of scenarios,\nincluding learning (Gierasimczuk, Kurzen, &\nVel\u00e1zquez-Quesada 2009), and communication networks\n(Aucher, van Benthem, & Grossi\n2018). On finite graphs, the game is clearly determined, with\nthe computational complexity of identifying who has a winning strategy\nbeing Pspace-complete (L\u00f6ding & Rohde\n2003).\n\nThe existence of this winning strategy can be expressed by a\nfirst-order formula. More specifically, winning conditions can be\ndefined in a bimodal logic that combines a standard modality for\ntravel steps with a new modality for one-step arrow deletion,\ninterpreted in models \\(M = (W, R, V)\\):\n\n\\(M, s \\vDash [{-}]\\varphi\\quad\\) For each edge \\((u, v)\\) in \\(R:\\,\n\\, (W, R {-} \\{(u. v)\\}, V) \\vDash \\varphi\\)\n\nThis logic fits the sabotage game closely. On top, it is a natural\nfragment of the first-order language of graphs. Surprisingly, this\nlogic is undecidable (L\u00f6ding & Rohde\n2003), making it one of the simplest examples of an undecidable\nmodal logic over arbitrary models.\n\nFurther graph games in a similar spirit exist, including the poison\ngame of Duchet and Meyniel (1993), where\nthe Demon poisons nodes, rather than deleting edges. Extensive studies\nof modal logics for changing graphs, and \u03bc-calculi for defining\ngeneric solutions to graph games are given in Areces,\nFigueira et al. (2011); Areces, Fervari, and\nHoffmann (2015); and Aucher, van Benthem & Grossi (2018). A\nclassification of graph games including the effects of complex goal\nformulas and imperfect information is found in van\nBenthem and Liu (2019).\n\nOne perspective on such logics for reasoning about model change is the\nsemantic games approach of\n Section 6.1.\n In standard evaluation games, the initial model does not change.\nModalities for model change, however, require a process of formula\nevaluation where the model of evaluation changes as, say, witnesses\nfor quantifiers are not replaced (unlike in standard semantics for\nfirst-order logic), or moves change facts by causing damage to\naccessibility relations. In other contexts, similar modalities are\njustified by physical measurements that change the phenomenon under\ninvestigation, (Hintikka 2002; Renardel 2001;\n\u00c5gotnes & W\u00e1ng 2017), while another natural\nexample are the dynamic-epistemic logics for information update\nmentioned in the discussion of game play (Baltag & Renne 2016). Such generalized form of semantics\nare of independent logical interest.\n\nExample Knowledge Games.\n\nNew logical games also arise naturally within the dynamics of\ninformation, knowledge or belief as triggered by the process of game\nplay (cf.\n Section 4).\n In particular, information update suggests conversation games between\nparticipants with similar or different goals. These games may be\ncooperative, with players aiming to pool their information, thereby\nturning distributed knowledge into common knowledge (Meyer\n& van der Hoek 1995). But they can\nalso be competitive, say, when players strive to be the first to know\nwhether some relevant proposition holds. Mixtures between both modes\nalso occur, for instance with some players aiming to communicate a\nfact that outsiders should not learn about (van\nDitmarsch 2003).\n\nA concrete example are the \u2018announcement games\u2019 of \u00c5gotnes\nand van Ditmarsch (2011).\nPlayers speak simultaneously and only once, while pursuing goal that\nare specified as epistemic formulas. Speaking is modeled by public\nannouncement, and players preferences are binary. They prefer final\nmodels where their goal formula holds over those where it is\nfalse.\n\nThese games are conducted under imperfect information, as players may\nnot know the true state of their epistemic model. Accordingly, the\nrelevant strategies need to be uniform. Players must say the same\nthing in all states they cannot distinguish. In general, then, many\nsolution concepts produce mixed strategy outcomes. In fact, it can be\nshown that there exists simple announcement games without any unique\nequilibrium in pure strategies. However, there is a relevant role for\nlogic to play. Suppose that the goal statements are all\n\u2018universal\u2019, i.e., constructed from literals by applying\nonly conjunction, disjunction, knowledge operators, and dynamic\nmodalities with universal announcements. Truth of such formulas is\npreserved when transitioning from a model to a submodel. Consequently,\nepistemic uncertainty becomes less harmful and knowledge games with\nuniversal goals have equilibria in pure strategies. Recently,\nknowledge games have been expanded further to include both questions\nand answers as separate actions of issue change and information change\n(\u00c5gotnes, van Benthem et al.\n2012).\n\nExample Boolean games.\n\nA third example of game design in between game logics and logic games\nare the Boolean games of Harrenstein et al.\n(2001) and Gutierrez, Harrenstein, and\nWooldridge (2015) that have been mentioned several times\nalready. Each player is handed control over a subset of the\npropositional variables, and can pick truth values for these at will.\nUsing goals specified in temporal logics, these games can model a\nlarge number of relevant scenarios of agency. By now, a growing body\nof work addresses various aspects of Boolean games including their\ncomputational characteristics (both single-shot and iterated), their\ngame-theoretic properties and equilibria (Gutierrez,\nHarrenstein, & Wooldridge\n2015), and their connections with games played on social\nnetworks (Seligman & Thompson 2015).\nFurther discussion can be found in the entry on\n coalitional powers.\n6.3 Special Topics\n\nBack and forth between game logics and logic games\nThe topic of this section suggests cycles between the two perspectives\non logic and games. Given a logical system, one can design logical\ngames for it, which can then again be studied using some appropriate\ngame logic. Conversely, given a game, one can introduce a logic for\ndescribing it, and then introduce evaluation games for that logic, and\nso on. Sometimes these cycles reach fixed-points, where, say, the\nevaluation game for a formula describing some game is isomorphic to\nthat game itself. But sometimes, the cycling continues. For\ndiscussion, see Rebuschi (2006) and van Benthem\n(2014).\n\nImperfect information Logic games naturally support\nimperfect information, where players do not have complete access to\nwhat their opponents do. Epistemic variations can have far-reaching\nconsequences for the corresponding logics. A particularly prominent\nframework among this lines is the\n independence friendly logic\n of Hintikka and Sandu (1989), see also\nHintikka and Sandu (1997) and Mann, Sandu, and\nSevenster (2011).\n\nArgumentation games and graph games Another strand of\ngame analysis with a connection to logic is the study of argumentation\nnetworks (Dung 1995; Caminada & Gabbay\n2009), with uses in AI and philosophy (Grossi\n2013; Shi 2018)\n\nComputational logic The material in this section is\nclosely connected to games in computational logic, which serve to\nanalyze expressive power of languages. For relevant results and\nconnections with automata theory, see Gr\u00e4del,\nThomas, and Wilke (2002) and\nvan Benthem (2014).\n\nGaming and mechanism design Game design is a\nwell-known aspect in the area of gaming (Rouse\n2000). Likewise, mechanism design is an established topic in\ngame theory (Nisan & Ronen 2001; Osborne\n& Rubinstein 1994). For connections between between logic,\ngame design and planning, see (L\u00f6we,\nPacuit, & Witzel 2011; L\u00f6we 2008).\n\n7. Discussion and Further Directions\n\nThis entry presents an overview of current work at the interface of\nlogic and games. The topics surveyed fall in a number of strands\nincluding current logical analysis of games in the broadest sense,\ncontacts between logic and classical game theory, connections with\nprobability and with computation, and, lastly, the game-theoretic\ncontent of logic itself.\n\nAll this produced a perhaps bewildering variety of logical systems at\nthe interface with games. Yet, this entry also shows a certain unity\nin approach, since the same sort of (modal) logics turn out suitable\nto deal with quite different aspects of game structure and game play.\nMoreover, when we step back a little, broader perspectives across the\nspecific systems surveyed here arise.\n\nOne noteworthy phenomenon is the existence of two different styles of\nlogical analysis. Some logical systems \u2018zoom in\u2019 on\nparticular aspects of an activity or reasoning practice, providing\nmore detail than what is usually found in standard mathematical or\nphilosophical analysis. Other logical systems do the opposite, and\n\u2018zoom out\u2019 to general patterns that may not have been\nvisible at the more detailed level of the original practice.\n\nMost of the logical systems in this entry are of the fine-grained\n\u2018zooming-in\u2019 variety. Even so, coarse-grained logics of\nthe \u2018zooming-out\u2019 variety are interesting, too, as they\nmay highlight laws or general patterns in social behavior that lie\nbeyond the details attended to by games and game theory. One example\nis the current interest in logics for the abstract notion of\ndependence (V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2007;\nBaltag 2016). Many forms of dependence and independence\npermeate social life. Baltag and van Benthem\n(2021) present a simple modal base logic of functional\ndependence and independence which fits this perspective, suggesting an\nanalysis of strategies in extensive games as dynamic devices that\ncreate dependencies among players. Chen, Shi & Wang (2022, Other\nInternet Resources) then combine this framework, applied to strategic\ngames, with the modal preference logic discussed above to find a\ncommon logical structure underlying both competitive and cooperative\ngames. Another example of the logical search for generality in games\nis the proof-theoretic analysis of Hu and\nKaneko (2012) of the general postulates for social interaction\nin Johansen (1982).\n\nThe interface area of logic and games still is in statu\nnascendi. Correspondingly, there are obvious gaps and desiderata\non the logic side, which are reflected in the material in this\nentry.\n\nIn particular, one fundamental theme are syntactic perspectives on\ngame-theoretic reasoning. Samples of a proof-theoretic style of\nanalysis for play can be found in de Bruin\n(2005). More concretely, Zvesper\n(2010) analyzes classical results in epistemic game theory,\n(cf. Tan & Werlang 1988; Aumann\n1999), in terms of abstract modalities for belief and\noptimality, showing how a few simple proof rules from modal\n\u03bc-calculus can capture the essence of famous results in epistemic\ngame theory. Proof-theoretic aspects of logic have so far been\novershadowed by semantic analyses, although this situation is changing\nslowly (Artemov 2014; Kaneko 2002; Kaneko &\nSuzuki 2003). Model-based reasoning provides abstract semantic\nperspectives on games that can aid conceptual clarification, and the\ndiscovery of general laws. But it might turn out to be proof theory\nthat governs the concrete reasoning used in the semantics, and that\nmay be able to guide the context of justification in establishing\ngeneral facts about games.\n\nA further contact with logic that has been ignored in this entry is\nthe rich interface between games and descriptive set theory (Woodin\n2010; Kanamori 2003).\n\nIt should be stressed once more that logic is not the only formal\ndiscipline that throws light on games. Quantitative probability enters\nthe study of games in many ways, both in classical and in evolutionary\ngame theory. The interface of logic and games may well profit from the\nmany old and new contacts between logic and probability (Leitgeb\n2017; Lin & Kelly 2012;\nHarrison-Trainor, Holliday, & Icard 2016).\n\nAnother link that remained underrepresented in this entry are\ncomputational aspects. The study of games, play and players has\nnatural connections with computation and agency in computer science\nand AI (Gr\u00e4del, Thomas, & Wilke 2002;\nAbramsky 2008; Halpern 2013; Perea 2012; Brandenburger 2014).\nThe proper perspective on what has been presented here may well turn\nout to be a triangle of interfaces between logic, games, and\ncomputation.\n\nAs for still broader connections, we have not done justice to all\nlinks between logic, games and philosophy, of which more are found in\nStalnaker (1996, 1999). The same is true\nfor links to linguistics and psychology (Clark\n2012). In this language-oriented connection, one should also\nmention the work of Bjorndahl, Halpern, and\nPass (2017) on the natural language used in specifying games\nand reasoning about them, thus making game analysis more\ndescription-dependent.\n\nFinally, the main thrust of this entry is theoretical and\nfoundational. However, there also is a more practical aspect to logic\nand games. Logic plays a role in cognitive psychology and experimental\ngame theory, if only to identify testable hypotheses related to Theory\nof Mind or strategic reasoning (Ghosh,\nMeijering, & Verbrugge 2014; Ghosh & Verbrugge 2018; Bicchieri\n1993; Fagin, Halpern et al. 1995). Lastly, some work at the\ninterface of logic and games suggests outreach to the world of actual\nparlor games (van Ditmarsch & Kooi 2015;\nvan Benthem & Liu 2019).\n\nAll in all, the claim of this entry is a modest one. Logic and games\nform a natural combination, that may reveal interesting things when\npursued explicitly. Even so, too much logic may import too much of a\nformal apparatus, which may end up strangling the games perspective:\nlogical systems are infinite machineries that can easily overwhelm a\nconcrete game of interest. In short, the contact has to be managed\nwith care.",
