This is the starting point\nfor the interventionist programme, which is based on the idea that\nreal systems are constantly subject to outside perturbations, and that\nit is exactly these perturbations that drive the system into\nequilibrium. In other words, it\u2019s these interventions from\noutside the system that are responsible for its approach to\nequilibrium, which is what earns the position the name\ninterventionism. This position has been formulated by Blatt\n(1959) and further developed by Ridderbos and Redhead (1998). The key\ninsight behind the approach is that two challenges introduced in\n Section 6.3\n vanish once the system is not assumed to be isolated: the entropy can\nincrease, and a non-stationary distribution can be pushed toward a\ndistribution that is stationary in the future.\n\nThis approach accepts that isolated systems do not approach\nequilibrium, and critics wonder why this would be the case. If one\nplaces a gas like the one we discussed in\n Section 1\n somewhere in interstellar space where it is isolated from outside\ninfluences, will it really sit there confined to the left half of the\ncontainer and not spread? And even if this were the case, would adding\njust any environment resolve the issue? Interventionist\nsometimes seem to suggest that this is the case, but in an unqualified\nform this claim cannot be right. Environments can be of very different\nkinds and there is no general theorem that says that any environment\ndrives a system to equilibrium. Indeed, there are reasons to assume\nthat there is no such theorem\u00a0because while environments do drive\nsystems, they need not drive them to equilibrium. So it remains an\nunresolved question under what conditions environments drive systems\nto equilibrium.\n\nAnother challenge for interventionism is that one is always free to\nconsider a larger system, consisting of our original system plus its\nenvironment. For instance, we can consider the \u201cgas + box\u201d\nsystem. This system would then also approach equilibrium because of\noutside influences, and we can then again form an even larger system.\nSo we get into a regress that only ends once the system under study is\nthe entire universe. But the universe has no environment that could\nserve as a source of perturbations which, so the criticism goes, shows\nthat the programme fails.\n\nWhether one sees this criticism as decisive depends on one\u2019s\nviews of laws of nature. The argument relies on the premise that the\nunderlying theory is a universal theory, i.e., one that applies to\neverything that there is without restrictions. The reader can find an\nextensive discussion in the entry on\n laws of nature.\n At this point we just note that while universality is widely held,\nsome have argued against it because laws are always tested in highly\nartificial situations. Claiming that they equally apply outside these\nsettings involves an inductive leap that is problematic; see for\ninstance Cartwright (1999) for a discussion of such a view. This, if\ntrue, successfully undercuts the above argument against\ninterventionism.\n",
