    "main_text": "Frege\u2019s Theory of Extensions: Basic Law V || How the Paradox is Engendered\n2.7 How the Paradox is Engendered\n\nWe\u2019ve now reconstructed the inconsistency in Frege\u2019s\nsystem by representing his logic and Basic Law V in a modern system of\nsecond-order logic. Philosophers have diagnosed the inconsistency in\nvarious ways, and it is safe to say that the matter is still somewhat\ncontroversial. In this subsection, we discuss only the basic elements\nof the problem. Most philosophers and logicians agree that the reason\nsecond-order logic can\u2019t be extended by Basic Law V is that the\nresulting system requires the impossible situation in which the domain\nof concepts has to be strictly larger than the domain of extensions\nwhile at the same time the domain of extensions has to be as large as\nthe domain of concepts.\n\n\nTo analyze the inconsistency in more detail, consider\nan extensional model of concepts, in which the material\nequivalence of concepts \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) serves as both necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the identity of \\(F\\) and \\(G\\), i.e., in\nwhich \\(F = G \\equiv \\forall x(Fx \\equiv Gx)\\).  So, given this\nunderstanding, if it is not the case that \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are\nmaterially equivalent, then \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are distinct concepts; and\nif \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are distinct concepts, then they are not materially\nequivalent.\n\nWith this extensional view of concepts in mind, we can see how a\nparadox is engendered. Recall first that the Existence of Extensions\nprinciple correlates each concept \\(F\\) with an extension \\(\\epsilon\nF\\). Each direction of Basic Law V requires that this correlation have\ncertain properties. We shall see, for example, that the right-to-left\ndirection of Basic Law V (i.e., Va) requires that no concept gets\ncorrelated with two distinct extensions. [Frege uses the label\n\u2018Vb\u2019 to designate the left-to-right direction of Basic Law\nV, and uses \u2018Va\u2019 for a variant of the right-to-left\ndirection. See, for example, Gg I, \u00a752. However,\nmany commentators use \u2018Va\u2019 to designate the left-to-right\ndirection. We shall follow Frege\u2019s use, since that will make\nsense of his Appendix to Gg II, in which he discusses\nthe paradoxes by discussing Vb and Va.] We may represent Frege\u2019s\nVa as follows:\n\nBasic Law Va:\n\n\\(\\forall x(Fx \\equiv Gx) \\to\\epsilon F = \\epsilon G\\) \n\nSo the contrapositive asserts that if \\(\\epsilon F \\neq \\epsilon G\\),\nthen \\(\\neg \\forall x(Fx \\equiv Gx)\\).  But in the case where the\nmaterial equivalence of \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) is a necessary condition for\n\\(F = G\\), i.e., in the case where \\(\\neg \\forall x(Fx \\equiv Gx)\\)\nimplies \\(F \\neq G\\), then Va implies that if \\(\\epsilon F \\neq\n\\epsilon G\\), then \\(F \\neq G\\), i.e., that whenever the extensions of\n\\(F\\) and \\(G\\) differ, the concepts with which they are correlated,\nnamely \\(F\\) and \\(G\\), differ. This means that the correlation\nbetween concepts and extensions that Basic Law V sets up must be a\nfunction \u2013 no concept gets correlated with two distinct\nextensions (though for all Va tells us, distinct concepts might get\ncorrelated with the same extension). Frege noted (in the Appendix\nto Gg II) that this direction of Basic Law V\ndoesn\u2019t seem problematic. \n\nHowever, the left-to-right direction of Basic Law V (i.e., Vb) is more\nserious. We may represent Vb as follows:\n\nBasic Law Vb:\n\n\\(\\epsilon F = \\epsilon G \\to\\forall x(Fx \\equiv Gx)\\) \n\nSo the contrapositive asserts that if \\(\\neg \\forall x(Fx \\equiv Gx)\\)\nthen \\(\\epsilon F \\neq \\epsilon G\\).  But in the case where the\nmaterial equivalence of \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) is a sufficient condition for\n\\(F = G\\), i.e., in the case where \\(F \\neq G\\) implies \\(\\neg \\forall\nx(Fx \\equiv Gx)\\), then Vb implies \\(F \\neq G \\to \\epsilon F \\neq\n\\epsilon G\\), i.e., that if concepts \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) differ, the\nextensions of \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) differ. So, the correlation that Basic\nLaw V sets up between concepts and extensions will have to be\none-to-one; i.e., it correlates distinct concepts with distinct\nextensions. Since every concept is correlated with some extension,\nthere have to be at least as many extensions as there are\nconcepts.\n\nBut the problem is that second-order logic with Basic Law V as a\nwhole requires that there be more concepts than\nextensions. The requirement that there be more concepts than\nextensions is imposed jointly by the Comprehension Principle for\nConcepts and the new significance this principle takes on in\nthe presence of Basic Law V. The Comprehension Principle for Concepts\nasserts the existence of a concept for every condition on objects\nexpressible in the language. Now although it may seem that this\nprinciple, in and of itself, forces the domain of concepts to be\nlarger than the domain of objects, it is a model-theoretic fact that\nthere are models of second-order logic with the Comprehension\nPrinciple for Concepts (but without Basic Law V) in which the domain\nof concepts is not larger than the domain of\n objects.[3]\n However, the addition of Basic Law V to Frege\u2019s system forces\nthe domain of concepts to be larger than the domain of objects (and so\nlarger than the domain of extensions), due to the endless cycle of new\nconcepts that arise in connection with the new extensions contributed\nby Basic Law V. However, as we saw in the last paragraph, Vb requires\nthat there be at least as many extensions as there are concepts.\n\nThus, the addition of Basic Law V to second-order logic implies an\nimpossible situation in which the domain of concepts has to be\nstrictly larger than the domain of extensions while at the same time\nthe domain of extensions has to be as large as the domain of\nconcepts.\n\nRecently, there has been a lot of interest in discovering ways of\nrepairing the Fregean theory of extensions. The traditional view is\nthat one must either restrict Basic Law V or restrict the\nComprehension Principle for Concepts. Recently, Boolos (1986/87, 1993)\ndeveloped one of the more interesting suggestions for revising Basic\nLaw V without abandoning second-order logic and its comprehension\nprinciple for concepts. On the other hand, there have been many\nsuggestions for restricting the Comprehension Principle for Concepts.\nThe most severe of these is to abandon second-order logic (and the\nComprehension Principle for Concepts) altogether. Schroeder-Heister\n(1987) conjectured that the first-order portion of Frege\u2019s\nsystem (i.e., the system which results by adding Basic Law V to the\nfirst-order predicate calculus) was consistent and this was proved by\nT. Parsons (1987) and Burgess\n (1998).[4]\n Heck (1996), Wehmeier (1999), Ferreira & Wehmeier (2002), and\nFerreira (2005) consider less drastic moves. They investigate systems\nof second-order logic which have been extended by Basic Law V but in\nwhich the Comprehension Principle for Concepts is restricted in some\nway. See also Anderson & Zalta (2004) and Antonelli & May\n(2005) for different approaches to repairing Frege\u2019s system. See\nFine (2002) for a discussion of the limits of Frege\u2019s method and\nsee Burgess (2005) for a good general overview.\n\nWe will not discuss the above research further in the present entry,\nfor none of these alternatives have achieved a clear consensus.\nInstead, we focus on the theoretical accomplishment revealed by\nFrege\u2019s work in Gg. As noted in the\nIntroduction, Frege validly proved a rather deep fact about the\nnatural numbers notwithstanding the inconsistency of Basic Law V. He\nderived the Dedekind/Peano axioms for number theory in second-order\nlogic from Hume\u2019s Principle (which was briefly mentioned above\nand which will be discussed in the next section). But this fact went\nunnoticed for many years. Though Geach (1955) claimed such a\nderivation was possible, C. Parsons (1965) was the first to note that\nHume\u2019s Principle was powerful enough for the derivation of the\nDedekind/Peano axioms. Though Wright (1983) actually carried out most\nof the derivation, Heck (1993) showed that although Frege did use\nBasic Law V to derive Hume\u2019s principle, his (Frege\u2019s)\nsubsequent derivations of the Dedekind/Peano axioms of number theory\nfrom Hume\u2019s Principle never made an essential appeal to\nBasic Law V. Since Hume\u2019s Principle can be consistently added to\nsecond-order logic, we may conclude that Frege himself validly derived\nthe basic laws of number theory. It will be the task of the next few\nsections to explain Frege\u2019s accomplishments in this regard. We\nwill do this in two stages. In \u00a73 we study Frege\u2019s attempt\nto derive Hume\u2019s Principle from Basic Law V by analyzing\ncardinal numbers as extensions. Then, we put this aside in \u00a74 and\n\u00a75 to examine how Frege was able to derive the Dedekind/Peano\naxioms of number theory from Hume\u2019s Principle alone.\n",
