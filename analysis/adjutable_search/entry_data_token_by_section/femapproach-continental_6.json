    "main_text": "Continental Feminism and Asian American Feminist Thought\n7. Conclusion and New Directions in Continental Feminism\n\nThis entry has listed a number of ways in which Continental approaches\nand figures are used to address feminist issues; we have attempted\nboth to describe some of the ongoing research areas in Continental\nfeminism and to point out new directions it has been taking over the\npast decades. However, this list remains incomplete as we have been\nunable to account for all of the important work underway. A more\ncomplete entry would need to include projects on the intersection\nbetween Continental feminism and critical disability studies,\nindigenous feminisms, and new materialisms and humanisms. Furthermore,\nwe do not mean to suggest that there is no overlap or intersection\nbetween the topics or figures grouped under each section heading here.\nLastly, there is certainly ongoing work of which we are not aware that\nis already making an impact on the present and future of feminist\nscholarship. We thus conclude here not with a summative statement\ndefining Continental feminism but rather by reflecting on the material\nconditions of Continental feminism.\n\nWhen Linda Mart\u00edn Alcoff addressed the Eastern American\nPhilosophical Association in 2012, she reflected on the tension and\nissues within disciplinary philosophy and urged philosophers to\n\u201capply our diagnostic impulses to ourselves\u201d (Alcoff 2013:\n43). A necessary aspect of such praxis for Continental feminists in\nlight of the genealogies considered here is exemplified by Audre Lorde\nwho, speaking on the \u201cPersonal is Political Panel\u201d at the\nSecond Sex Conference in 1979, stated\n\n\nI urge each one of us here to reach down into that deep place of\nknowledge inside herself and touch that terror and loathing of any\ndifference that lives there. See whose face it wears. (Lorde 1984a:\n101)\n\n\nLorde calls feminists to enact a humble and frank confrontation with\ntheir own embodied lives and senses of self in the context of each\nperson\u2019s differential implication in racist, sexist,\nheterosexist, classist and ableist power. Rather than imagining that\none puts on one\u2019s thinking hat and reflects \u201cas a\ntheorist\u201d and then take it off and acts \u201cas a regular\nperson\u201d, Continental feminisms suggest that the subject who\ntheorizes is themself always an embodied subject: Kris Sealey reminds\nus that \u201cContinental methods oftentimes refract differently\nacross race and gender axes\u201d and that for this reason,\nContinental feminists ought \u201cto be intentional about the\nrelationship they occupy, quite simultaneously, to racial and gender\nliberation\u201d (Sealey 2017: 166). As this entry has shown, the\ndiversity of Continental feminist thought has been developed through\nthe thoughtful negotiation of many different struggles. For the\nimagined community of Continental feminism to continue to grow and\nsupport these projects, space must continually be made for new\npractitioners. Since, as we put above, Continental feminism is less\nconcerned with changing a woman\u2019s place in a symbolic or social\nsystem, and more on upending that system itself, members of this\nacademic community must continue to do the work that will make it\npossible to learn from each other. Only in this way Continental\nfeminism can be opened up fully to its interdisciplinary\npotential.\n",
