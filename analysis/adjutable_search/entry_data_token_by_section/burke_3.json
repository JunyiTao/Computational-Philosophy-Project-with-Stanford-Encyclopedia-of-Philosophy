    "main_text": "Philosophical and Historical Writings\n4. Philosophical and Historical Writings \nLocke\u2019s Essay concerning Human Understanding of 1690\nwas the first attempt to give a survey of the mind\u2019s workings\nthat was both comprehensive and post-aristotelian. It soon fostered\nintense interest in epistemology, psychology and ethics. Burke seems\nto have worked on the imagination\u2014the faculty of devising and\ncombining ideas \u2014 as an undergraduate, and continued to do so\ninto the 1750s. The result, A Philosophical Enquiry into the\nOrigin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757)\nemphasized, unsurprisingly, the activity of mind in making ideas and\nthe influence of these upon conduct. It was in the first place an\nexercise in clarifying ideas, with an eye to refining the ways in\nwhich the arts affect the passions: in other words, a refinement of\ncomplex ideas was taken to be the precondition of a refinement of\npractice.  The roots of human activity, Burke thought, were the\npassions of curiosity, pleasure and pain. Curiosity stimulated the\nactivity of mind on all matters. Ideas of pain and of pleasure\ncorresponded respectively to self-preservation and society, and\nsociety involved the passions of sympathy, imitation and\nambition. Imitation tended to establish habit, and ambition to produce\nchange. Sympathy did neither, but it did establish an interest in\nother people\u2019s welfare that extended to mental identification\nwith them. The scope of sympathy could embrace anyone, unlike\ncompassion, which applied only to those in a worse situation than\noneself. Such width of concern had an obvious reference to the social\norder (and may express also Burke\u2019s thinking about the theatre).\nThe passions, understood in Burke\u2019s way, suggested at once that\nsociety as such answered to natural instincts, and that it comprised\nelements of continuity and improvement alike. Burke then proceeded to\nshow that self-preservation and its cognates suggested the complex\nidea of the sublime, and not least the idea of a God who was both\nactive and terrible. Beauty, on the other hand, comprised a very\ndifferent set of simple ideas, which originated in pleasure. Sublime\nand beautiful therefore sprang from very different origins.\n\n\nThe diverse views rejected by A Philosophical Enquiry were\nunited by the pervasive assumption that human nature in an unschooled\ncondition, as it came from the hand of nature, and understood without\ndirect reference to God, was in some sense adequate to the human\ncondition. Rousseau\u2019s Discourse on Inequality was at odds\nwith Burke\u2019s view of the naturalness of society, and with his view\nthat solitude, because unnatural, was a source of pain, as well as\nwith Burke\u2019s position that sympathy, rather than merely compassion,\nwas a key emotion. Burke\u2019s view that the mind formed ideas of beauty\nfrom the ideas of pleasure it received contradicted the view of\nShaftesbury and Hutcheson that beauty (like goodness) was a perception\npresented by a sixth or moral sense. Burke\u2019s further view that our\nsimple ideas of pain went towards a complex idea of a God who inspired\nterror, was very distant from the deists\u2019 view that He could be\nunderstood by our natural faculty of reason alone and that as such He\nwas known to be benevolent and not much besides. These three positions\nalike presumed that human faculties, unimproved by human effort and\nconsidered with little relation to God, were sufficient to inspire\nconduct. It is not surprising that Burke rejected them.  Burke\nnot only thought that nature needed improvement, but also recognized\nits ambiguity. Ambition, for instance, was the source of enterprise\nand of improvement: but Burke did not suppose that the enterprise\nproduced by this characteristic was in all its manifestations a\nbenefit to its exponent, and indeed once called it \u2018the cause of\nthe greatest disappointments, miseries and misfortunes, and sometimes\nof dangerous immoralities\u2019 [4].  If Burke had a forward-looking mind, and\nbelieved that human nature both required and led to development, he\ndid not think that progress was necessarily an unqualified gain: for\ninstance, in discussing the civilizing of American\n\u2018savages,\u2019 he saw a diminution of their courage as well as\nan increase in their moral goodness. (For Burke,\n\u2018savagery\u2019 contrasts with civilisation, and unlike some\nother figures, did not suppose that savagery was equivalent to all\nbehaviour of indigenous peoples).\n\nA Philosophical Enquiry suggests that Burke was developing\nthe loyalties of his youth through the medium of philosophical\npsychology. A God who presents Himself through nature in a way that is\noften found in the Bible, and who devises and sustains nature in a way\nthat leads man to society and facilitates the improvement of that\nsociety, has set Himself to support Christianity, power and\nimprovement, and probably education too. At the same time, however,\nother aspects of the book suggest that this support was delivered to\nthem, not on their own terms, but on the terms of a philosophy which\nrecognizes the ability of the imagination to transform people\u2019s\nunderstandings of themselves and society.\n\n\nAnyone who thinks in terms of complex ideas can see that these can\nbe framed easily in different ways, none of which need correspond to\nanything found in the external world: combine the ideas of a man and a\nhorse, as Locke had suggested, and you have the idea of a centaur. No one who reads romances\nwould find difficulty in imagining a society differing beyond\nrecognition from its current arrangements. A classic instance of\npolitical imagination, indeed, is Burke\u2019s own Vindication of\nNatural Society, which presents as an alternative model of society\nan organization\u2014if that is the word\u2014devoid of civil\ngovernment, church and significant private property.\n\n\nBurke, in other words, could think through not only his own grouping\nof claims but also their opposites. This reflects, no doubt, other\nfeatures of his mind apart from his understanding of complex ideas,\nsuch as the skill in seeing the strong side and the obverse of any\nargument, which Burke had acquired in his undergraduate study of\nrhetoric; and it reflects, too, a habit of versatility begun in his\ndebating society, for there speakers were called upon to play roles;\nand no doubt it is reminiscent, again, of Burke\u2019s undergraduate\ninterest in the theatre. Yet beyond all of these, it suggests that in\nthe large topics which experience had put before Burke\u2014religion,\nmorals, arts and sciences\u2014argument had not produced an\noverwhelmingly decisive case. For A Vindication also seems to\nmake a case against everything he had espoused.\n\n\nIf argument did not deliver incontestable conclusions, where was one\nto go? Burke\u2019s answer, in his notes, was that where this was so,\npeople should prefer the conclusions that accorded with\ntheir natural feelings. The complement to this emphasis upon feeling\nwas to look to the results of affective preference\u2014that is to\nsay, a criterion for conduct in such a case was what tended to make\npeople better and happier.\n\n\nThis was a judgement in the first place about personal conduct, and\nthe manner of applying it to matters on the larger scale of civil\nsociety was less obvious. Here the judgement of benefit, whether\nethical or pleasurable, might be harder to discern. In order to make it\nplain in A Vindication, Burke applied a reductio ad\nabsurdum to principles in theology that he had rejected by showing\ntheir consequences for politics.\n\n\nFor that is what A Vindication provided. This short work\nwas written in the persona of the recently deceased Henry St. John,\nViscount Bolingbroke (1678\u20131751). Bolingbroke had been a Tory pillar of\nthe state, and therefore of the church too; but the posthumous\npublication of his philosophical works revealed that far from being an\nAnglican, he had not been a Christian\u2014but rather a deist. A\nVindication suggested the ills that Bolingbroke had attributed to\nthe artifice of revealed religion could be paralleled by those\ngenerated by civil society. One logic, indeed, was attributable on\nthese terms to both Christianity and civil society: that just as the\nlatter distributed the means of power unequally, so too did\nChristianity distribute those of salvation unequally (for not everyone\nhad heard, and fewer believed, the Gospel). The deism of Bolingbroke\nimplied the principle that God treated everyone impartially, and that\nthe means to salvation were therefore to be found in a medium available\nto all, and thus available from the earliest point of human history,\nnamely reason. It was easy to add, as Burke did, that if the principle\nthat such an original nature was the mature expression of God\u2019s\nordinances were to be applied to civil society, the normative result\nwould be a regression from complex and therefore civilised forms to a\nsimple society, even to animal-like primitiveness\u2014some of the\nmatter of A Vindication paraphrases Rousseau\u2019s Discourse\non Inequality (Sewell 1938, 97\u2013114). So Bolingbroke the deist and\nBolingbroke the politician could be made to look very much at odds with\neach other. This gap offered Burke an opening. A\nVindication satirized Bolingbroke\u2019s schizophrenic position,\nemploying a good deal of transparent exaggeration to make\n\u2018his\u2019 criticisms of civil (\u2018artificial\u2019)\nsociety seem very absurd: and Burke added a preface to the second\nedition which made the disjunctive alternatives clear so that even he\nwho ran might read.\n\n\nYet it is hard not to recognize that Burke himself was telling the\nreader, in a way that entered the consciousness all the more forcibly\nbecause it accompanied entertainment, that civil society really did\ninvolve some evils, just as he identified losses as well as\ngains from progress in other connexions. Burke\u2019s Vindication,\nspeaking in the voice of pseudo-Bolingbroke, lamented the situation of\nminers: and \u2018the innumerable servile, degrading, unseemly,\nunmanly, and often most unwholesome and pestiferous occupations\u2019\nof \u2018so many wretches\u2019 was lamented by Burke without any such \npersona, thirty-four years later in Reflections on the Revolution\nin France. Such criticism, taken in itself, is undoubtedly\ntelling. Burke never dissembled the existence of the real misery that\nhe observed in civil society. Instead, he pointed out that wretched\npractices could not be detached from the larger pattern of habits and\ninstitution in which they were implicated, and that this pattern had a\nbeneficial effect overall. Burke recognized misery, did not deny it, and\ntherefore had a lively sense of the imperfection of arrangements,\nhowever civilized they might be. His sense of duality in nature and\nsociety resembles Adam Smith\u2019s.\n\n\nBurke\u2019s position, therefore, was poised. But it was not merely a\nmatter of pointing out what made for good and what for ill in civil\nsociety: it was a matter of responsibility\u2014of choosing morally\nappropriate words. This was so for a philosophical reason, because of\nthe very nature of the words involved. Burke\u2019s Philosophical\nEnquiry divided words into three categories. First, there were\naggregate words, which signified groups of simple ideas united by\nnature, e.g. man, horse, or tree. Second, there were simple abstract\nwords, each of which stood for one simple idea involved in such\nunities, as red, blue, round or square. Thirdly, and most importantly\nfor our purpose, came abstract compound words. These united aggregate\nwords and simple abstract words. As such, they did not have a referent\nthat existed in nature. A Philosophical Enquiry argued that no\ncompound abstract nouns suggested ideas to the mind at all readily, and\nthat in many cases they did not correspond to any idea at all, but\ninstead produced in the mind only images of past experience connected\nwith these words. This category included virtue, vice, justice, honour,\nand liberty, besides magistrate, docility and persuasion (Wecter 1940,\n167\u201381). The centrality of such terms to a discussion of civil society\nrequires no emphasis. The obvious inference from Burke\u2019s philosophy of\nlanguage was that to use abstract compound words was less to discuss\nideas than to raise images which touched the affections of the listener\nor reader. To do this could scarcely to be thought part of a\nspeculative activity: the effect would not be cognitive, but practical:\nnot to develop ideas, but to influence conduct. The question was, with\nwhat arrangements were these words, and therefore pleasurable images,\nto be connected.\n\n\nThis understanding of the mind gave speakers and writers an\nunusually powerful role. It was in their hands to connect words which\nsuggested pro-attitudes with arrangements of their choosing:\nfor these words had did not imply only one set of conceptual contents,\nbecause they implied none. If one recollects the propensity to\nimitation that Burke found in mankind, this choosing was likely also to\nbe leading. So Burke was exceptionally sensitive to the role of men of\nletters and public speakers in moulding opinion. By the same measure,\nhe had an unusually lively sense of their responsibilities. It was\nthey who had the power to guide people to the proper ends, or\nelsewhere. Guidance need not be directly didactic\u2014indeed, it\ncould not be, because there could be no definitions to expound \u2014\nbut would be a matter of providing a linguistic context which guided\nlisteners and readers to goals that were ethically and politically\nbeneficial.\n\n\nOne crucial approach that Burke himself developed was\nhistoriographical. In works of history or in oratory, discussion\ninvolving a compound abstract noun\u2014such as\n\u2018civilization\u2019 or \u2018liberty\u2019\u2014 could take place in\nconnexion with aggregate words like \u2018Indians\u2019 or \u2018the\nEnglish\u2019, and, therefore, being discussed in relation to these,\nconnected that noun with definite ideas rather than with further ideas\nthat had no easily identifiable content\u2014or no content at all.\nAlmost all of Burke\u2019s writings and his more important speeches have a\nstrong historical element. That element is cast as a narrative in a way\nthat connects compound abstract words with specific persons and\nspecific transactions. Burke also wrote avowedly historical works in\nthe years immediately after publishing A Philosophical Enquiry\nThe content of these histories developed the preferences of his youth\nfor improvement by embodying these in a way that made them integral to\nthe origins and continuing character of modern arrangements in the\nAmericas and in England.\n\n\nBurke, like Smith again, wrote \u2018philosophical\u2019 history,\nthat is to say gave a view of the key agencies that had shaped human\ndestiny over the long run of human society. Indeed, he casually\nimplied a four-stage theory of socio-economic history at a time when\nScottish stadial history, except that in Dalrymple\u2019s Feudal\nProperty (1757), was either unwritten or unpublished. But his\nattention, primarily, lay elsewhere, as appears in An Account of\nthe European Settlements. This work arose from the initiative of\n\u2018booksellers\u2019 alive to the reading public\u2019s interest in\nNorth America, where Britain was then at war with France, and the work\nwas co-written with Burke\u2019s \u2018cousin\u2019 and friend William\nBurke. Edmund\u2019s pen is evident in the passages which contrast \u2018savagery\u2019\nwith civilization. The book emphasized that the coming of Europeans to\nthe New World brought with it a civilizing of \u2018savages,\u2019 who were far\nfrom noble, through the agency of institutionalised Christianity. This\nimplicit distance from the cult of \u2018the noble savage,\u2019 and from\nprimitivism in general, provided an identifiable complement to the\nimplied rejections of A Philosophical Enquiry and the satire\nabout \u2018natural society\u2019 in A Vindication.\n\n\nA stage of human history rather later than that of \u2018savages\u2019 was\ndelineated within An Abridgement of English History, which\nBurke wrote after 1757, but did not finish. So far as it goes, this\nprovided a continuous account that ran from the Roman landings to\nMagna Carta. Christianity figured again in this narrative as a source\nof civilization, but the significance of the tale was more\ncomplex. This time the story was primarily political, and showed how\none of the values most prized by Burke\u2019s contemporaries, civil\nliberty, came to belong to England. The Norman Conquest of England\nestablished a powerful executive government and brought with it a\nuniform system of law; if these two were necessary conditions for the\nmatching grace of civil liberty for all, however, they were not\nsufficient: the required addition came from an aristocracy, which had\nbeen taught the value of liberty by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and\nwhich had come to understand that its own power was insufficient to\nextract the requisite concessions from the crown unless popular\nsupport could be won. Burke\u2019s sense of the double-edged character of\ncivilization thus developed into a sense that the political regime\nrequired by an advanced society\u2014the combination of strong\ninstitutions with civil liberty\u2014came from sources that\nwere contrary to each other, and not always beneficial in isolation\n(aristocracy as a form of government was an \u2018austere and\ninsolent domination\u2019 (TCD, W & S, 1981\u20132015,\nii. 268)): and as both a strong executive and civil liberty were\nneeded, by the same token the forces making for each needed to be\ncounterbalanced from the other side on a continuing basis. This\nbalance of forces characterised a situation in which\n\u2018liberty\u2019 had an identifiable content, namely the specific\ncivil liberties secured through political struggle and written into\nMagna Carta.\n\n\nBurke\u2019s narratives suggested that agencies antipathetic to each other,\nif properly connected to one another, might produce results that were\nboth intelligible and valuable. One effect amongst several of this\nconception of cooperative conflict was a rehabilitation of the\nRoman Catholicism that was the historic heritage of Burke\u2019s family. An\nAccount and An Abridgement alike suggested that in its\nhistorical time and place Roman Catholicism, and, indeed, clericalism,\nwhether embodied in Jesuit missionaries or in an English archbishop,\nhad been a constituent needed to produce social and political benefits\nof a fundamental kind. As an historiographical exemplar, An\nAbridgement therefore showed an exceptional appreciation of the\nMiddle Ages, which was to cause raptures to Lord Acton. It anticipated\nboth Richard Hurd\u2019s Letters on Chivalry and Romance (1762),\nand, still more, a great work that set the bearings for Anglo-American\nmedievalists for many years, William Stubbs\u2019 Constitutional\nHistory of England (1875\u20138). Burke, however, could not think in\nterms of an academic historiography, still less one that would be the\nexclusive intellectual preoccupation of its exponents: neither of\nthese existed in his time. He could think, however, of subtly defusing\nanti-Roman prejudice in Georgian Britain.\n\n\nBurke himself was not a Roman Catholic, and viewed enquiry into his\npersonal background with alarm and suspicion. This was sensible enough\nin a Britain which still subliminally linked civil liberty with\nProtestantism, and therefore regarded Irishness as a likely pointer to\npopish subversion of its political values. Burke\u2019s argumentative\nstance always benefited Roman Catholics, but he never found a kind\nword for the Pope: his was a position which emphasized the priority of\ncivil interests over denominational claims in civil society. Indeed\nBurke considered that \u2018the truth of our common Christianity, is\nnot so clear as this proposition: that all men, at least the majority\nof men in the society, ought to enjoy the common advantages of\nit.\u2019 (TPL, W & S 1981\u20132015, ix.464). This was a political\ndevelopment of the centrality he gave to the claims of improvement,\nand of the obvious necessity of its free development for the bettering\nof the human condition. It also silently defused any papal claim to\ncivil dominance on theological grounds and, more audibly, suggested\nthat the penalisation of Roman Catholic beliefs was wrong if these did not\ncause Catholics to interfere with others\u2018 civil interests. Burke\u2019s\npresumptions about the priority of civil interests and a sense of the\npossible irrelevance of denominational opinion to civil society\nsuggest a reading of Locke\u2019s Letter concerning Toleration\nand Two Treatises of Government, the latter of which was\ncommon, though not prescribed reading at Trinity. It also implies that\nthe proper terms in which to conceive civil interests are those of\nnatural jurisprudence, because there people are considered without\nreference to any specific allegiances, religious or otherwise. Burke\nreferred to natural law and natural rights directly when such\nreference advanced his own arguments, though he made no theoretical\ncontribution to natural jurisprudence until quite late in life. His\ncreative energies were mostly applied elsewhere.\n\n\nBurke developed his thoughts about civil interests in a work that his\nexecutors entitled Tracts on the Popery Laws, which he\ndrafted when he was employed as private secretary to the Chief\nSecretary for Ireland in the early seventeen-sixties. After this,\nBurke became involved more immediately in political practice, and, by\none means or another, contributed to it until his death and (through\nthe activities of his executors in publishing or reprinting his\nwritings) from beyond the grave. This was one obvious route for\npractical development, even besides the amenities of status that it\nbrought to Burke. For his view of the compound abstract words involved\nin civil discussion did not suggest that purely speculative study had\nunlimited potential either for the mind or for personal satisfaction,\nbecause a strictly speculative discussion was likely to be\ninconclusive at best: such words became more readily intelligible in\nconnexion with the concrete, and therefore the practical. Hence,\nperhaps, Burke concluded that \u2018man is made for Speculation and\naction; and when he pursues his nature he succeeds best in\nboth.\u2019 (Somerset 1957, 87). There was, on this understanding,\nintellectual benefit in political participation, and, equally,\npolitical practice might benefit from the speculative mind. This is\nlikely to seem an implausible position nowadays, when political\nactivity is frenetic, and learning is a matter of speciality; but in\nthe eighteenth century, when an agile mind could manage at least the\nbasics of several branches of learning, and the British legislature\nwas often in session for less than six months each year, it was more\nplausible. Political participation, on Burke\u2019s understanding,\nbesides its intellectual possibilities, had an ethical potential. To the\nextent that thinking about politics was necessarily uncertain, the\nproper conduct of affairs depended upon an honest as well as a\ncapacious mind, and on a well-disposed management of words.\n\n\nIt remains to show what Burke learnt from political activity, and\nwhat he conferred upon it. The picture is one in which the claims of\npractice enriched Burke\u2019s mind and brought intellectual benefits to\npractice itself.\n",
