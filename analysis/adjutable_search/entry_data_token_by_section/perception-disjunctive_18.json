    "main_text": "Disjunctivist Accounts of Hallucination and Illusion || Illusion\n5.2 Illusion\n\n\nDifferent disjunctivists group together perceptions, illusions and\nhallucinations in different ways when offering their disjunctive\ncharacterisations of perceptual experience. At points it looks as\nthough Hinton is suggesting that illusions can be grouped together\nwith veridical perceptions. For in certain places he says that his\nPerception-Illusion disjunctions permit a description of what is seen\nin terms of how the thing looks, thereby allowing the following kind\nof Perception-Illusion disjunction: \u2018S sees something\nwhich looks blue or is having that illusion\u2019 (1973,\n61). In other places he says things that suggest that the illusion of\nan object appearing blue should not be grouped together with veridical\nperception, for he says that an experience as of blue is equivalent to\nthe mere disjunction \u2018Either I actually see an optical object\nthat is blue in colour, or I am in some situation\u2026 that is to\nme like that one\u2019 (1967b, 12). Snowdon groups together\nperceptions and illusions in his disjunctive characterisation of\nexperience: \u2018Either (there is something which looks to\nS to be F) or (it is to S as if there is\nsomething which looks to S to be F)\u2019. In\ncontrast, McDowell, in his appeal to the idea of facts being\nmade perceptually manifest, appears to group together illusions and\nhallucinations: an appearance that such-and-such is the case can be\n\u2018either a mere appearance or the fact that such-and-such is the\ncase making itself perceptually manifest to someone\u2019.\n\n\nThe differences in the ways these philosophers formulate their\nparticular disjunctive characterisations may in part reflect their\ndifferent particular interests in appealing to a disjunctive account of\nexperience. For example, Snowdon\u2019s primary concern is to block an\nargument about what is required for the perception of objects\n(see section 6.1), whereas McDowell is concerned to defend an account\nof experience that safeguards the distinctive epistemological role of\ngenuine perception in providing us with propositional\nknowledge. It is not clear that McDowell needs to deny that there are a\nnumber of facts made perceptually manifest to you when you suffer an\nillusion, in which case he might allow that it is possible to group\ntogether veridical perceptions and illusions as cases in which certain\nfacts are made manifest to their subject.\n\n\nSimilar considerations may apply in the case of experiences that we\nmight describe as partial hallucinations\u2014cases in\nwhich a subject hallucinates an object while veridically perceiving\nother aspects of her environment. For example a subject might\nveridically perceive a table in front of her while hallucinating a pink\nrat on top of it. One question that can be asked of McDowell\u2019s\ndisjunctivism is whether, according to it, we should treat such cases\nas ones in which the fact that there is a table in front of the subject\nis made perceptually manifest to her, despite the fact that she is\nhallucinating a pink rat.\n\n\nMartin (2004) offers a sketch of how a na\u00efve realist might\ndevelop an account of partial hallucination. He suggests that rather\nthan focusing on experiences per se, we can focus on\nthe various aspects of an experience\u2014\u201cthe\ndifferent entities that one can experience and the ways in which they\ncan appear to one\u201d (2004, 81). We can then explain those aspects\nof a partial hallucination that are not genuinely perceptual in terms\nof \u201cthat aspect of experience\u2019s indiscriminability from the\ncorresponding aspect of a perceptual awareness of that element\u201d\n(2004, 81). Martin also appeals to this idea in offering a suggestion\nas to what the disjunctivist should say about the experience of\nimpossible scenes. His suggestion is that the disjunctivist should\nexplain such experiences not by direct appeal to the idea of veridical\nperception of the impossible scene, but rather by explaining how an\nexperience with each of the constituent elements is indiscriminable in\nthat respect from a perception of that element. (For criticism of this\nproposal see Siegel 2004). One concern with this proposal is whether\nthere may be some problem for the disjunctivist in thinking of such\nexperiences as having a sort of hybrid nature, given that the\ndisjunctivists think that perceptions and hallucinations are mental\nevents with such different natures. (For an argument for the claim that\naccommodating certain illusions poses significant difficulties for the\ndisjunctivist, see Smith 2010. See also Millar 2015).\n\n\nA further question to be asked in this context is whether the\ndisjunctivist should treat all cases of illusion as equivalent to\ncases of partial hallucination. For example, if a subject perceives a\ngreen object that looks to her to be blue, should the disjunctivist\nsay that the subject is perceiving the object but hallucinating the\nblueness it seems to possess? Brewer (2008) offers a disjunctivist\naccount of certain illusions that he thinks need not be treated as\ncases of partial hallucination (e.g., the Mueller-Lyer\nillusion). According to Brewer, such illusions are simply cases in\nwhich the direct object of experience has visually relevant\nsimilarities with paradigms of a kind of which it is not in fact an\ninstance. The fact that the direct object of perception\nlooks F, but isn\u2019t, is explained in terms of the idea\nthat the object may intelligibly be taken to be F, when seen\nfrom the point of view in question, in the relevant circumstances of\nperception, in virtue of its relevant similarities with certain\nparadigm Fs. In the case of certain illusions, when an object\nlooks to be a certain way that it isn\u2019t, a disjunctivist might\nplace emphasis on the idea that this misleading appearance is publicly\nobservable; for instance, it might be the sort of thing one is able to\nphotograph. The disjunctivist might then say that in such cases we can\nascribe to the seen object a publicly observable feature\u2014a\n\u2018look\u2019 or \u2018appearance property\u2019 that the\nobject has. When one sees the object one may be visually aware of this\nappearance property\u2014its having the look of an F. And\none\u2019s awareness of this appearance property may intelligibly\nmislead one into mistakenly judging the object to be F. (For\nrelated proposals about perceptual illusions, but which differ from\nBrewer\u2019s account in important respects, see Antony 2011 and\nGenone 2014. For defence of the claim that empirically grounded models\nof illusion may be congenial to na\u00efve realism, see Phillips\n2016.) \n",
