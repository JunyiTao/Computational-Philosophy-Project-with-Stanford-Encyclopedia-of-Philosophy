(1949: 5\u20136)\n\n\nSome have seen this sort of statement as broadly contradictory, in\nsuggesting that what makes determinates similar (e.g., color)\nis also that in virtue of which they are different (\u201cof their\ndifference we can only say \u2026 that their color is\ndifferent\u201d);\n see \u00a73.2.\n\nPrior also considers and rejects Johnson\u2019s assumption that\ndeterminates are similar only in respect to their unique form of\ndifference, rather suggesting (c.f. Salmieri\u2019s discussion of\nAristotle, above) that determinates are similar \u201cin respect\nof\u201d that determinable:\n\n\n[I]t seems to me that determinates under the same determinable have a\nclass unity [\u2026]. Determinates under the same determinable have\nthe common relational property [\u2026] of characterising whatever\nthey do characterise in a certain respect. Redness, blueness, etc.,\nall characterise objects, as we say, \u201cin respect of their\ncolor\u201d; triangularity, squareness, etc., \u201cin respect of\ntheir shape\u201d. And this is surely quite fundamental to the notion\nof being a determinate under a determinable. (1949: 13)\n\n\nThat determinates characterize objects in respect of their\ndeterminables is indeed a key feature of determination, though there\nremains disagreement about how best to metaphysically articulate this\nfeature (e.g., as involving shared determinables or not).\n\nPrior takes this feature to push against deflationary approaches on\nwhich determinables exist, at best, merely to classify the having of\ndeterminate properties. On the contrary, he maintains, if determinates\nare unified by characterizing objects in a certain respect, then\n\n\nthe \u201crespects in which objects are to be characterised\u201d,\nto which determinable adjectives refer, are related to the objects not\nless but more intimately than the determinate qualities which\n\u201ccharacterise\u201d them. (1949: 13)\n\n\nMoving on, Searle (1959) usefully highlights that determination\nappears to contrast not just with the conjunct-conjunction relation,\nbut also with the disjunction-disjunct relation:\n\n\n[C]learly not any two terms which stand in the relation of greater to\nless specific ipso stand in the relation of determinate to\ndeterminable: \u201cyellow\u201d is in some sense more specific than\n\u201cyellow or angry\u201d but it is not a determinate of\n\u201cyellow or angry\u201d in the sense in which it is a\ndeterminate of \u201ccolor\u201d. (1959: 141\u20132)\n\n\nSearle also offers an explicit criterion of determination:\n\n\nFor any two terms \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\(A\\) is a determinate of \\(B\\) if\nand only if \\(A\\) is a non-conjunctive specifier of \\(B\\), and \\(A\\)\nis logically related to all other non-conjunctive specifiers of \\(B\\)\n[where] any two terms are logically [i.e., conceptually] related if\neither entails the other or either entails the negation of the other.\n(1959: 148)\n\n\nInterestingly, this criterion doesn\u2019t rule out that \\(B\\) is a\ndisjunction of its determinates (\u2018non-conjunctive\nspecifiers\u2019), so long as the determinates stand in the requisite\nconceptual entailment relations. Note also that Searle moves fluidly\nbetween talk of determinable properties and talk of determinable\n\u2018terms\u2019; until recently, this sort of slide was\ncommon.\n\nSearle notes, as well, that the structure of determinables and\ndeterminates in the same family may give rise to \u201clevels\u201d\nof determinates ordered by degree of specificity; as he says,\n\u201cwe would like some way of showing that e.g., \u2018red\u2019\nand \u2018yellow\u2019 are on the same level as determinates of\n\u2018color\u2019 whereas \u2018scarlet\u2019 is on a different\nand lower level\u201d (1959: 145). Here too he offers a\ncriterion:\n\n\nTwo terms \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are same level determinates of \\(C\\) if and\nonly if they are both determinates of \\(C\\) and neither is a specifier\nof the other. (1959: 149)\n\n\n(Here the notion of a \u2018specifier\u2019 is one according to\nwhich X specifies Y iff X entails\nY, but Y does not entail X.) Seale\u2019s\ncriterion is flawed, however, since while it correctly deems\nred and yellow same-level determinates, and\ncorrectly deems red and scarlet different-level\ndeterminates, it incorrectly deems red and buttercup\nsame-level determinates.\n\nNext, Armstrong\u2019s investigations into the metaphysics of\nproperties (in, e.g., his 1978a,b, 1989, 1997, and 2010) are notable,\nfirst, in treating determination as an explicitly metaphysical\nrelation, and second, in raising to salience the important question of\nwhether determinables are ontologically reducible to determinates,\nasked against the commonly accepted background assumption that reality\nitself is maximally determinate. As we\u2019ll see, Armstrong\u2019s\nown position on this score swings from reductionism (1987) to\nnon-reductionism (1997), and back again (2010).\n\nFinally, Yablo\u2019s (1992) is notable in offering a modal account\nof (perhaps better: necessary condition on) determination as a\nrelation of asymmetric dependence, and in extending determination to\nparticulars (events) as well as properties. Since asymmetric\nnecessitation now serves as a common minimal characterization of\ndetermination, it\u2019s worth seeing how Yablo motivates this\napproach. He starts by observing a parallel between intuitive\ncharacterizations of identity and of determination, as holding between\nproperties:\n\n\n\\(P\\) is identical to \\(Q\\) iff: for a thing to be \\(P\\) is for it to\nbe \\(Q\\).\n\n\\(P\\) determines \\(Q\\) iff: for a thing to be \\(P\\) is for it to be\n\\(Q\\), not simpliciter, but in a specific way.\n\n\nThe parallel is useful in suggesting that determination is, like\nidentity, a particularly intimate relation, in that determinable and\ndeterminate types and/or tokens may not be wholly distinct, and also\nin suggesting a modal treatment of determination. Hence just as the\ncharacterization of identity is illuminated by the following modal\ncondition (stemming from the principle of the indiscernibility of\nidenticals):\n\n(I) \\(P\\) is identical\nto \\(Q\\) only if: necessarily, for all \\(x\\), \\(x\\) has \\(P\\) iff\n\\(x\\) has \\(Q\\).\n\n\nso too is the characterization of determination illuminated by the\nfollowing modal condition:\n\n(D)\\(P\\) determines\n\\(Q\\) (\\(P > Q\\)) only if: (i) necessarily, for all \\(x\\), if \\(x\\)\nhas \\(P\\) then \\(x\\) has \\(Q\\); and (ii) possibly, for some \\(x\\),\n\\(x\\) has \\(Q\\) but lacks \\(P\\).\n\n\nThe parallel also suggests that an account of determination\nneedn\u2019t impose conditions on conceptual entailment relations (as\nSearle\u2019s did): just as Kripke\u2019s (1980) results undermine\nthe need for a conceptual entailment requirement on identity (e.g.,\nwater might be identical with H\\(_2\\)O even if \u2018water\u2019 and\n\u2018H\\(_2\\)O\u2019 don\u2019t conceptually entail each other),\n\u201cwe should discount the traditional doctrine\u2019s conceptual\ncomponent and reconceive determination in wholly metaphysical\nterms\u201d (Yablo 1992: 253). That said, as Yablo admits, asymmetric\nnecessitation alone is insufficient to characterize determination\n(since, e.g., allowing conjunctions to determine their conjuncts). We\nwill later consider various ways of filling in the modal condition,\nincluding Yablo\u2019s own essence-based approach\n (\u00a73.5.1).\n\nYablo\u2019s discussion is also notable in highlighting an important\nseeming feature of determinables and determinates, according to which\nthey do not causally compete:\n\n\n[No causal exclusion principle can] apply to determinates and their\ndeterminables\u2014for we know that they are not causal rivals.\n[\u2026] any credible reconstruction of the exclusion principle must\nrespect the truism that determinates do not contend with their\ndeterminables for causal influence. (1992: 259)\n\n\nThis feature is key to a recently popular strategy for solving the\nproblem of mental (and more generally, higher-level)\ncausation\u2014an intriguing application which raised to salience the\npotential usefulness of determination for metaphysical and other\nphilosophical purposes (see \u00a75.2).\n",
