There are three points that might suggest\nJayar\u0101\u015bi was of South India, all being rather weak. The\nstrongest evidence is the circulation and reception of the\nTattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha: the first mention of the work is made\nby South Indian Digambara authors Vidy\u0101nanda (c. 850) and\nAnantav\u012brya (turn of 10th and 11th centuries). Another equally\nweak piece of evidence is that Jayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s critical method of\nargument (see below), which the Jainas adopt, first penetrates the\nworks of South Indian Digambara authors, incidentally the same who are\nthe first to make reference to Jayar\u0101\u015bi. This method of\ncritique becomes the standard one among Gujarati Jainas only at a\nlater stage. The third argument in favour of South Indian origin of\nJayar\u0101\u015bi (Sa\u1e41ghav\u012b\u2013P\u0101r\u012bkh 1940,\nxi), even weaker that the two above, is his title Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da,\nregularly appended to the names of a number of South Indian\nphilosophers and often used as an official title of South Indian\nDigambara high rank clerics (bha\u1e6d\u1e6da,\nbha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101raka). Jayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s title might suggest\nhe was both South Indian and a Brahmin by social class (var\u1e47a).\nHowever, the title Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da is not exclusively used by\nBrahmins or exclusively in South India, though there is indeed a\ncertain tendency of this kind. However, since there seems nothing at\nall to suggest that Jayar\u0101\u015bi was born in North India, even\nsuch slight hints gain some evidential weight.\n",
