Epistemology and philosophy of language\n\nHere is the basic epistemological stance that Dharmak\u012brti\ninherited from Dign\u0101ga\u2019s Pram\u0101\u1e47asamuccaya.\nJust as there are only two kinds of objects of knowledge, real\nparticulars and fictional universals, there are only two types of\nknowledge, or more exactly \u201csources of knowledge\u201d\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a), viz., \u201cperception\u201d\n(pratyak\u1e63a) and \u201cinference\u201d\n(anum\u0101\u1e47a). Perception is always purely\nnon-conceptual and non-linguistic whereas inference is conceptual,\nlinguistic\n thinking[28]\n that proceeds on the basis of good reasons. Particulars are the\nobjects of perception and universals are the objects of\ninference\u2014one sees specific shapes, colors, but when one thinks\n\u201cred is a color\u201d the subject and predicate terms range\nover several things. Perception has the special status of giving\ndirect access to the real, whereas conceptual thought is, in an\nimportant way, distorted (bhr\u0101nta) because it\n\u201csuperimposes\u201d universals that aren\u2019t actually there in\nthe particulars themselves.\n\nFor Dign\u0101ga (and his successors) this split between perception\nand conceptual thought was part and parcel of a type of\nfoundationalism. Perception is directly causally bound to particulars\nand \u201cfixed\u201d (niyata) by them: its internal\nrepresentation (\u0101k\u0101ra) of the object is causally\ndetermined by, and corresponds to, the particular itself. It is for\nthat reason that perception is the fundamental \u201ccontact\u201d\nwith the world upon which the superstructure of conceptual cognition\nrests; conceptual cognition, on the other hand, is not fixed in this\nway by particulars and can to a large degree think what it will about\nwhatever it chooses. The separation between perception and conceptual\nthinking in Pram\u0101\u1e47asamuccaya is thus radical\nindeed and yields what seems to be a counterintuitive consequence. For\nDign\u0101ga it would seem that one and the same object could never be\nboth perceived and thought about. Non-Buddhist thinkers, such as\nNaiy\u0101yikas and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, did not have this\nproblem. They could cheerfully allow that when one person sees a vase\nand another thinks about it, the type of understanding may be\ndifferent but the object is the same in that the conceptual thought\ngrasps a real universal vaseness that inheres in the same particular\nvase that is perceived. But Dign\u0101ga could not go that route as a\nnominalist. For him if the object of thought is vaseness, that object\nis unreal and thus quite different from the real particular vases that\none sees.\n\nTwo problems loom large in Dign\u0101ga\u2019s account: (1) What are the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions of a source of knowledge\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a) and when are we justified in thinking\nthat these conditions are met? (2) Given that only perception has\ndirect access to the real and is causally bound to it, how is it that\nconceptual thought could ever be about real particulars at\nall and be considered a genuine source of knowledge? We\u2019ll take up the\nquestions one by one.\n",
