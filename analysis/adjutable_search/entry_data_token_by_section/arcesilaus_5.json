    "main_text": "Inapprehensibility and universal suspension of assent || The Non-Rational Belief interpretation\n4.3 The Non-Rational Belief interpretation\n\n\nThe NRB view instead argues that universal\nsuspension isn\u2019t opposed to beliefs per se, but only to\nbeliefs justified through philosophical theory or reasons generally.\nThe Stoics maintain that the mind is essentially rational, so that its\nassent is necessarily reason-responsive (see Coope 2016).\nArcesilaus\u2019 skepticism, on this view, challenges the rationalist\npresupposition that belief is necessarily and explicitly grounded in\nreason. This doesn\u2019t preclude that Arcesilaus found himself\u2014as\na result of the inadequacy of the arguments for any position, and of\nthe equally convincing arguments against it\u2014with the belief\nthat nothing can be known. Thus, inapprehensibility is neither\nthe conclusion of a deductive argument relying on a theory of knowledge\nor of our cognitive faculties, nor an inductive inference from prior\ninvestigations; it is not a theoretical or even rationally warranted\nbelief, but just the way things strike him (see Cooper 2004 and\nThorsrud 2009).\n\n\nBut in the case of universal suspension, it seems that the\nview that it is irrational to hold unwarranted beliefs is\nheld\u2014at least in part\u2014on the basis of a theoretical belief\nthat knowledge is very important to acquire and that mere belief is to\nbe avoided. Cicero, for instance, stresses that Arcesilaus agreed with\nZeno that it is irrational to hold opinions, i.e., inadequately\nwarranted assents (premise [6] in sect. 3, above); and Sextus suggests\nthat he thought that individual cases of suspended\nbelief\u2014presumably in the light of inconclusive\narguments\u2014were good (Outlines of Pyrrhonism 1.233). And\nthe view that it is irrational to hold mere beliefs (that is,\nopinions) depends on a further set of epistemological beliefs about\nthe nature of belief and knowledge. If Arcesilaus was not rationally\ncommitted to any set of assumptions about the nature and requirements\nof rationality or about belief and knowledge\u2014which he ought not\nto be, given that he had argued against the various views on offer,\nand hence, ex hypothesi, suspended belief about them\u2014it\ndoesn\u2019t look like he can believe that one ought not to take beliefs to\nbe justified.\n\n\nThe NRB view thus takes universal\nsuspension to be a belief that is not rationally warranted, as\nwell as the views on which it causally depends. That is, Arcesilaus\nbegan inquiry motivated by a pre-theoretical belief, that philosophical\nknowledge is important and mere belief inadequate. And his repeated and\nextensive investigations left him with the realization that even these\nregulating assumptions of his philosophical practice have failed to be\nwarranted and that no beliefs are justified.\n\n\nOn this view, the radical skeptic has beliefs but doesn\u2019t take them\nto be justified. This proposal raises problems, too (see Burnyeat\n1983). It seems that a large part of being a rational agent is to\nexercise some control over one\u2019s beliefs. Since this control takes the\nform of a responsiveness to reasons, it does not seem possible for\nrational agents to give up practices of justification. A related\nobjection is to maintain that even having beliefs, which involves the\nuse of concepts, is necessarily responsive to reasons (see Williams\n2004). To have a belief, according to this view, requires making a\nconscious inference about the proper use of concepts, and conscious\ninferences are made in virtue of reasons. One may respond that the\nskeptic isn\u2019t precluding herself from a responsiveness to reasons but\nrather lacks confidence in them, and that such rationalist theories of\nagency and belief are stricter even than the Stoics\u2019, against\nwhich Arcesilaus argued (see sect. 5 below).\n",
