Conclusions\n\nIn spite of the wide-range of topics covered in this entry\u2014from\nequity issues, philosophy of science, queer science studies, and\nneuroscience\u2014the focus has been incomplete in its focus on\nfeminism in the global North. The entry thus fails to fully represent\nfeminist perspectives on science. It is more accurate to describe it\nas presenting some feminist perspectives on science. Those\nthat are presented here have been important to those working in these\ntraditions and to some degree they include elements that have informed\nother feminisms, but not all. An example of the sort of work that has\nnot been considered is research on colonial, postcolonial, and\ndecolonial science studies (see Harding 2017 for an example of the\nlast). And, as Uma Narayan has pointed out, because western feminist\nphilosophers of science have so often targeted the value-free ideal\nassociated with positivism (see\n section 4.2),\n they sometimes fail to see the usefulness of that ideal for\nnonwestern feminists who may use it as a tool to challenge, for\nexample, oppressive religious values within their own culture (Narayan\n2004: 216\u2013217). Another area of interest also not addressed here\nis data science and questions about how power hierarchies are\noften reinforced through the categories and algorithms used in the\ncollection and interpretation of data\u2014including but not limited\nto gender classifications (D\u2019Ignazio & Klein 2020). There is\nalso an increasing body of work on the intersection of sex/gender,\nrace, class, and how science is implicated in the oppressions such\nintersections support. Also missing are discussion of disability and\nits problematic intersection with science, as well as reproductive\ntechnologies and feminist concerns (for example, see de\nMelo-Mart\u00edn 2017).\n\nThe result is that the entry provides background, but there is much\nmore that could be said and those interested would do well to begin\nwith the additional readings. What is covered here only gives a\nstarting point from which to investigate the many ways in which power,\nsex/gender, sexuality, and science are intertwined.\n",
