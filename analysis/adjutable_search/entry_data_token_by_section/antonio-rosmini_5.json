Human Rights\n\n\nRosmini\u2019s view of \u2018person\u2019, seen as an inviolable end\nwhich can never be reduced to the status of \u2018means\u2019, leads\nspontaneously to what today is seen as paramount in human existence,\nthat is, the question of human rights. These rights are studied at\nlength in The Philosophy of Right, a six-volume treatise in\nthe only extant English translation. The general title of the work\nshows immediately that for Rosmini all rights are founded in a single\nelement called \u2018right\u2019 from which all \u2018rights\u2019\nemanate, some innate in human beings, others springing from the\ndetermined circumstances of individuals or societies. The treatise can\nbe summed up under three heads: the essence of right, individual\nrights, social rights.\n6.1 The Essence of Right\n\n\nThe basis of Rosmini\u2019s teaching on human rights is a consequence of\nhis moral theory, of which he gives a careful synthesis in a preface to\nThe Philosophy of Right. If each person is morally obliged to\nrecognise in practice what is known for what it is known to be, every\nother human being will be recognised as essentially on a par with the\nknowing person, and will have to be acknowledged as such. But because\neach person is obliged to act in accordance with moral propriety, every\nperson is obliged to respect this obligation in the other on pain of\nviolating the moral law itself. Granted this principle as foundation,\nand \u2018right\u2019 as a relationship between one person and others\nby which a person has a claim to what is his own, Rosmini maintains\nthat \u2018person\u2019 is subsistent right. In other words, all rights\nare founded on that to which persons have a claim in so far as they are\nacting morally or are at least not acting immorally. Such activity\ncannot be the object of attack on the part of others without violation\nof persons as ends. \u2018Right\u2019, as he says, \u2018is a moral\ngovernance or authority to act, or: right is a faculty to do what we\nplease, protected by the moral law which obliges others to respect that\nfaculty\u2019 (ER, vol. 1, 237).\n\n\nThe essence of right is, therefore, the activity of a person or\npersons relative to other persons. This activity, however, can be\nexercised either by individuals or by persons acting as members of a\nsociety.\n6.2 Rights of individuals\n\n\nWhen a person\u2019s activity is actuated in a moral way, the object of\nthat activity becomes the person\u2019s own, that is, becomes proper to the\nperson in such a way that it cannot be violated without damage to the\nperson in whose ownership it is. Practical experience of this is found\nin what Rosmini calls \u2018jural resentment\u2019, the injured feeling\nthat occurs on the occasion of violation of some right and gives rise\nto an instinct for repossession or restitution. Such an experience is\nobviously not a fact related solely to matter; it is fundamentally a\nfact of the spirit where alone it can be felt. It is also an indication\nof the sphere of jural freedom within which a person is and must be\nleft free. More importantly, \u2018person\u2019 does not possess right,\nbut\u2014because formed by the light of being\u2014is right itself; does\nnot possess freedom, but is freedom. The divisions of activity give\nrise to two major kinds of rights in people. If what is possessed is\nsuch from the very beginning of existence in a human being (life, for\nexample), the individual possesses innate right(s) which may be called\n\u2018natural\u2019 (pertaining essentially to human nature) or\n\u2018rational\u2019 (the rights are what they are and cannot be\notherwise). But rights may also be acquired by human beings during the\ncourse of life through adventitious activity. When rights have been\nestablished in this way, they too are inviolable although there are\ncircumstances, such as lack of use, which dissolve the relationship of\nownership and thus leave the field open to others who may wish to\nextend their activity to the matter in question. Leaving these\ncircumstances aside, however, individual rights cannot be absorbed by\nothers. The State, for example, cannot absorb the inalienable rights\nproper to persons, nor can it be considered as more than its individual\nmembers in such a way that persons can be sacrificed for the sake of\nsociety.\n6.3 Social right\n\n\nNevertheless, societies exist within which rights arise from the\nbonds between intellectual beings. According to Rosmini, these\nsocieties fall under three headings: theocratic society, that is,\nsociety between God and his creatures; domestic society, which is\ndivided into conjugal and parental society; and civil society, that is,\nthe communion desired by several families who wish to entrust the\npreservation and the regulation of their rights to a single or\ncollective mind called \u2018government\u2019. Rosmini considers at\nsome length the rights arising in these societies. In particular, he\nponders the title of rights possessed by the Creator over human beings,\nthe rights proper to husband and wife, and to parents. Of special\ninterest is his description of the State as a society which, while it\nhas the duty to influence for the common good only the modality and\nexercise of rights in its citizens, has no power to create or destroy\nhuman rights. In fact, the general purpose of the State is to arrange\nthe exercise of individual rights in such a way that individuals are\nbetter able to enjoy the use of their innate and acquired rights. Thus,\nalthough in time of war the exercise of certain rights may be curtailed\nor even suspended, the rights remain invested in individuals to whose\nexercise they must be restored in normal circumstances. It is clear\nthat Rosmini\u2019s view of civil society is completely anti-totalitarian.\nHe does not, however, espouse the cause of modern democracy According\nto him, the principle of democracy is not \u2018one person, one\nvote\u2019, but would depend rather upon the contribution made by\ncitizens to the well-being of the State. Difficult to arrange in\npractice, the principle is nevertheless important, and can be\nconsidered the obverse of \u2018No taxation without\nrepresentation\u2019.\n",
