    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues || Necessity of Quantization\n6. Conclusion\n\nResearch on quantum gravity is beset by a combination of formal,\nexperimental, and conceptual difficulties. It is inevitable that the\nquest for a quantum theory of gravity will continue \u2013 whether\nfor reasons of necessity or not \u2013 and it seems that the\nresolution of the problem will require an equivalent combination of\nformal, experimental, and conceptual expertise. Given this, and given\nthe central position quantum gravity research occupies in theoretical\nphysics, it makes good sense for philosophers of physics (and general\nphilosophers of science) to do their best to acquaint themselves with\nthe central details of the problem of quantum gravity and the main\napproaches that are seeking to crack the problem. Beyond this, quantum\ngravity research has the potential to invigorate several standard\nareas of philosophical inquiry, including our standard notions of\ntheory construction, selection and justification; the nature of space,\ntime, matter, and causality, and it also introduces a new case study\nin emergence, with entirely novel features.\n",
