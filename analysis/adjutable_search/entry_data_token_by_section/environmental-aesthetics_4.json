    "main_text": "Twentieth Century Developments || The Neglect of the Aesthetics of Nature\n2.1 The Neglect of the Aesthetics of Nature\n\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, Anglo-American philosophy\nlargely ignored the aesthetics of nature. However, there were some\nnoteworthy exceptions. For example, in North America, George Santayana\ninvestigated the topic as well as the concept of nature itself.\nSomewhat later, John Dewey contributed to the understanding of the\naesthetic experience of both nature and everyday life, and Curt\nDucasse discussed the beauty of nature as well as that of the human\nform. In England, R. G. Collingwood worked on both the philosophy of\nart and the idea of nature, but the two topics did not importantly\ncome together in his thought. However, other than a few such\nindividuals, as far as aesthetics was pursued, there was little\nserious consideration of the aesthetics of nature. On the contrary,\nthe discipline was dominated by an interest in art. By the\nmid-twentieth century, within analytic philosophy, the principal\nphilosophical school in the English-speaking world at that time,\nphilosophical aesthetics was virtually equated with philosophy of art.\nThe leading aesthetics textbook of the period was subtitled\nProblems in the Philosophy of Criticism and opened with the\nassertion: \u201cThere would be no problems of aesthetics, in the\nsense in which I propose to mark out this field of study, if no one\never talked about works of art\u201d (Beardsley 1958). The comment\nwas meant to emphasize the importance of the analysis of language, but\nit also reveals the art-dominated construal of aesthetics of that\ntime. Moreover, if and when the aesthetic appreciation of nature was\ndiscussed, it was treated, by comparison with that of art, as a messy,\nsubjective business of less philosophical interest. Some of the major\naestheticians of the second half of the century argued that aesthetic\njudgments beyond what became known as the \u201cartworld\u201d must\nremain relative to conditions of observation and unfettered by the\nkind of constraints that govern the appreciation of art (Walton 1970,\nDickie 1974).\n\nThe domination of analytic aesthetics by an interest in art had two\nramifications. On the one hand, it helped to motivate a controversial\nphilosophical position that denied the possibility of any aesthetic\nexperience of nature whatsoever. The position held that aesthetic\nappreciation necessarily involves aesthetic judgments, which entail\njudging the object of appreciation as the achievement of a designing\nintellect. However, since nature is not the product of a designing\nintellect, its appreciation is not aesthetic (Mannison 1980). In the\npast, nature appreciation was deemed aesthetic because of the\nassumption that nature is the work of a designing creator, but this\nassumption is simply false or at least inadequate for grounding any\naesthetics of nature. On the other hand, the art-dominated construal\nof aesthetics also gave support to approaches that stand within the\nmany different historical traditions that conceptualize the natural\nworld as essentially art-like\u2014for example, as a set of the\n\u201cworks of nature\u201d, or as the \u201chandiwork\u201d of a\ncreator, or as picturesque scenery. For example, what might be called\na landscape model of nature appreciation, which stems directly from\nthe tradition of the picturesque, proposes that we should\naesthetically experience nature as we appreciate landscape paintings.\nThis requires seeing it to some extent as if it were a series of\ntwo-dimensional scenes and focusing either on artistic qualities\ndependent upon romantic images of the kind associated with the idea of\nthe picturesque or simply on its formal aesthetic qualities. Such\nart-oriented models of the aesthetic appreciation of nature, in\naddition to being supported by powerful and long-standing traditions\nof thought (Biese 1905, Nicolson 1959), are reconsidered in some\nrecent work in environmental aesthetics (Stecker 1997, Crawford 2004,\nLeddy 2005a, Tafalla 2010, Paden 2015b). Likewise, the defense of\nformalist aesthetic appreciation of nature has recently been renewed\n(Zangwill 2001 2013, Welchman 2018), along with related discussion and\ndebate (Parsons 2004, Parsons and Carlson 2004, Moore 2006).\n",
