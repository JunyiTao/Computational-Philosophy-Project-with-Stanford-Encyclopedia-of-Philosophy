    "main_text": "Life and Philosophical Development || Last Years\n3.9 Last Years\n\n\nPrior was at Manchester for seven years. In 1966, Anthony Kenny\nrecommended him for a fellowship at Balliol. The move would mean a drop\nin both status and salary, not to mention an increase in teaching, but\nPrior did not hesitate. His sabbatical in Oxford had been one of his\nhappiest years. \u2018This is the good life\u2019, he told George\nHughes once he was settled in at Balliol. He felt he simply belonged.\nPrior soon built up a reputation for being one of the best teachers in\nOxford\u2014though his students were sometimes surprised to be given\neighteenth century moralists to read instead of books by the currently\nfashionable.\n\n\nJust before his departure from Manchester, Prior told Tom Richards,\na visiting New Zealander, that he was going to Oxford with a mission.\nPrior\u2019s own work was an exemplary fusion of philosophy and logic,\nand he went to Oxford with the intention of interesting the\nmathematical logicians in philosophy and the philosophers in\nmathematical logic. The time was right; and Prior spared no energy in\npreaching his message:\n\n\n\n[F]ormal logic and general philosophy have more to bring to one\nanother than is sometimes supposed. I do not mean by saying this to\nunderrate the work of those who have explored the properties of\nsymbolic calculi without any concern as to what they might be used to\nmean \u2026 Nor do I mean to underrate what recent philosophers have\ndone in the way of exploring the obstinate and intricate\n\u2018logic\u2019 embedded in common discourse, even when they have\nnot derived or sought to derive anything like a calculus from it\n\u2026 But these activities are, or can be, related to one another\nvery much as theory and observation are in the physical sciences; and I\nmust confess to a hankering after well-constructed theories which much\ncontemporary philosophy fails to satisfy. (1957: vii.)\n\n\n\nPrior did not live to enjoy the entente cordiale between\nphilosophy and logic that he helped usher in. His health began to let\nhim down during his second year at Balliol. He was found to have both\nangina pectoris and polymyalgic rheumatism. During the autumn of 1969\nthe rheumatism grew steadily worse. He was at this time on sabbatical\nat the University of Oslo. The pain left him with no zest for work. He\ndutifully gave his weekly seminars and spent the remainder of his time\nbrooding savagely on how painful it was to do such elementary things as\nput on a coat. His hosts made him an appointment with a rheumatologist,\nwho prescribed cortisone. In a letter written a few days later, and a\nfew days before his heart failed, Prior described himself as one of the\nmiracles of modern medicine. \u2018I\u2019ve been sleeping well \u2026\nrunning up and down stairs \u2026 I can stand on one leg and put a\nsock on the other (first time for months) \u2026 they\u2019ve got me\ncured now and I\u2019m fine.\u2019\n3.10 Legacy in New Zealand\n\nLong after he departed for England in December 1958, Prior and his\nideas remained a strong influence on the development of logic in New\nZealand\u2014beginning with his arranging for Robert Bull and\nJonathan Bennett to share the teaching of his Advanced Logic course at\nCanterbury in 1959. Bull had recently found a completeness proof for a\nDiodorean logic of pure implication and taught this to the class\n(\u2018heaven help me\u2014and them\u2019, he says now).\n\nHugh Montgomery was among Bull\u2019s audience. Montgomery had been a\nmathematics student at Canterbury during the 1940s, while Prior was\nsingle-handedly booting undergraduate logic into existence. Now\nresuming his studies after a career as a furniture manufacturer in\nChristchurch, Montgomery fell heavily for logic. He found himself\n\u2018becoming more and more interested in tenses\u2019, after\nreading Prior\u2019s \u2018Diodoran Modalities\u2019. 1962 saw him\njoining the Canterbury philosophy department as an assistant lecturer\n(by then Shorter had succeeded Prior as professor and two lecturers\nhad been appointed, Jim Thornton and Rudi Ziedens).\n\nMontgomery was soon publishing a brisk flow of papers on modal\nlogic. Many were co-authored with Richard Routley, who graduated from\nthe Victoria University of Wellington\u2014known to all as\n\u2018Vic\u2019\u2014not long before Montgomery enrolled in\nBull\u2019s course. \u2018I grew up in the shadow of Prior\u2019,\nRoutley said: \u2018He was, I suppose, the dominant figure in New\nZealand philosophy in the late 1950s\u2019. There were other\nimportant philosophers working there, Routley conceded, \u2018but\nthey did not have the panache of Prior, or the larger-than-life\nstature, or the doctrine\u2019 (Sylvan 1996: 126). Routley moved to\nAustralia and went on to pioneer relevant and dialethic logics, as\nwell as environmental philosophy, changing his name to Sylvan in the\n1980s (he loved trees, especially the New Zealand\nkauri). Montgomery\u2014with Prior\u2019s forceful backing\u2014was\nappointed associate professor at Auckland University in 1969, and then\nto Auckland\u2019s chair of philosophy in 1970.\n\nBull, meanwhile, had followed Prior to England in 1960. He was\nsupposed to be going to Cambridge, but Prior\u2019s suggestion that\nhe divert to Manchester won the day. Max Cresswell joined them in\nManchester a year later. A student of George Hughes and David Londey\nat Vic, Cresswell had accidentally come across Prior\u2019s Formal\nLogic in the university library in 1957, at the end of his first\nundergraduate year. Excited by this discovery he also devoured Time\nand Modality. When he won a Commonwealth Scholarship for\npostgraduate study in the United Kingdom, Cresswell seized the\nopportunity to work with Prior. In 1963, he turned in his Ph.D., on\npropositional logics, and\u2014with a strong reference from\nPrior\u2014arrived back at Vic to step into Londey\u2019s\nshoes. (Londey, an Australian, was returning home.) Cresswell went on\nto dominate New Zealand logic for the next three decades. Bull\ncompleted a Ph.D. on modal logic under Prior, in 1962, and then enrolled\nat Oxford to study for a DPhil under Michael Dummett. At Oxford, Bull\nbegan publishing an important series of papers developing Priorean\ntense and modal logics (including his 1964, 1965 and 1970\u2014his\nand Krister Segerberg\u2019s 1984 handbook entry \u2018Basic Modal\nLogic\u2019 is still valuable today). With two doctorates in hand,\nBull worked at Birmingham and then Leeds before returning to a senior\nlectureship at Canterbury, at the end of 1968. From afar, Prior was\nstationing his men to fight for logic in his native land.\n\nWhen Cresswell arrived back, Wellington was becoming the focal point\nof logic in New Zealand. Hughes and Londey had a strong group of\ngraduate students, including Dorothy Grover and Tom Richards. Londey\nliked to use the English translation of Hilbert and Ackermann\u2019s\npre-war Grundz\u00fcge der Theoretischen Logik as a text for his\nadvanced course, and in 1965 he and Hughes published their own The\nElements of Formal Logic, aimed at undergraduates\u2014Prior\nreviewed it in the Australasian Journal of Philosophy,\ndescribing it as \u2018a very good buy\u2019 and \u2018broadly in\nthe style of Hilbert and Ackermann, and even more that of von\nWright\u2019 (Prior 1966). Also in 1965, Hughes and Cresswell\ntrialled the idea of an undergraduate course in modal logic. The\nElements contained no modal logic, and the lack of any suitable\ntextbook for the new course was a problem. \u2018We\u2019ll have to\nwrite our own\u2019, Hughes said jokingly to Cresswell. Their\nfamous An Introduction to Modal Logic appeared in 1968,\novernight turning modal logic from a subject accessible only to\nexperts into one that almost everybody with a bit of logic could\nunderstand.\n\nLogical mass was building. Malcolm Rennie, a young Australian, joined\nAuckland University in 1965 as a lecturer (snatched it is said from\nunder the nose of Jack Smart, who wanted him for the University of\nAdelaide). Rennie was strongly influenced by Prior\u2019s work, and\nbegan publishing a stream of papers on tense and modal logic. His 1971\narticle on Prior\u2019s tense system \\(QK_t\\) included a\neulogy: \u2018This paper is dedicated to the memory of the late\nArthur Prior: it was never my good fortune to meet him, but I am very\ngrateful for his personal encouragement in correspondence, and for the\ninterest generated by his many fertile and imaginative writings\u2019\n(Rennie 1971: 107). In 1968, Rennie taught a graduate course on Prior\nto his Auckland students, covering Priorean tense logic in Polish\nnotation.\n\nOn the other side of the world, at the 1968 Joint Session of the\nAristotelian Society and Mind Association at Liverpool University,\nPrior attended a symposium on \u2018What Actually Exists?\u2019,\ngiven by Peter Geach and Robert Stoothoff. He was impressed by\nStoothoff, saying approvingly in a letter to Montgomery that the young\nAmerican had \u2018done a lot of fighting for logic\u2019. Stoothoff\nwas unexpectedly contacted by Canterbury and offered\nShorter\u2019s\u2014Prior\u2019s\u2014chair. He accepted, arriving\nin Christchurch in 1970. (Shorter was moving on to a fellowship at\nLincoln College, Oxford.) Also in 1970, the Czech logician Pavel\nTich\u00fd accepted a senior lectureship in philosophy at the University\nof Otago. Tich\u00fd had fled his native Prague soon after Soviet tanks\ntook command of the streets in 1968. (His escape from East to West\nwas ably assisted by Geoffrey Keene, a logician from Exeter University\nin the UK (Svoboda et al. 2004: 26).) Once settled in New Zealand\nTich\u00fd wrote a paper on quantified S5, taking Hughes and Cresswell to\ntask for mis-formalizing a modal principle stated by Prior and von\nWright (Tich\u00fd 1973, Prior 1955a: 211). Soon he was indulging in the\nnational logical pastime of exploring Priorean temporal logics.\n\n1970 saw Cresswell visiting Segerberg in Finland (on the shores of the\nBaltic at Villa Wolax, the gracious 19th century summerhouse that the\nSegerbergs were renting from the von Wright family). Cresswell and\nSegerberg gathered mushrooms in the forest and spoke of logic in New\nZealand. It was an auspicious meeting. When Montgomery died, at the\ntragically early age of 53, Cresswell proposed Segerberg for the\nAuckland chair. The Segerbergs remember getting a call from New\nZealand \u2018in the middle of the night\u2019. The job came\n\u2018on a silver platter\u2019, Segerberg said. After a brief visit\nin 1979, Segerberg moved to Auckland in 1980. He found that New\nZealand logic was \u2018in a vibrant state\u2019.\n\nBy about 1970 a new generation of home-grown logicians had begun to\nenter the post-Prior landscape. In 1971, Rob Goldblatt took up a\njunior lectureship in mathematics at Vic. Wellington born and bred,\nGoldblatt learned modal logic from lectures by Cresswell and Hughes\nduring his second undergraduate year, and he completed his Ph.D. thesis\n\u2018Metamathematics of Modal Logic\u2019 under Cresswell in\n1974. \u2018That remarkable thesis established modal logic as a\nmature mathematical discipline\u2019, Bull said. Soon Goldblatt was\npublishing a deluge of papers on modal logic. Also in 1974 Fred Kroon,\npreviously one of the students in Rennie\u2019s Prior course at\nAuckland, was appointed to a lectureship in the Auckland philosophy\ndepartment. John Bigelow, who, as a Canterbury undergraduate, had been\ntaught \u2018terrific logic\u2019 by Montgomery, took up a\nlectureship in philosophy at Vic in 1973. Another admirer of Prior,\nBigelow was deeply immersed in tense and modal logic (working with\nHughes on tense logic), and he later staunchly defended Prior\u2019s\npresentism. When Bigelow arrived home in 1973 from his Ph.D. studies at\nCambridge, he found that New Zealand had become \u2018a powerhouse in\nlogic\u2019.\n\nAn interdisciplinary logic group formed around Hughes and Cresswell in\n1968, meeting at first fortnightly, and then weekly from about\n1970. The Wellington logic group \u2018was a deliberate attempt to\nmarry interests in mathematics and philosophy\u2019, said Wilf\nMalcolm, who worked on the foundations of mathematics (Malcolm 1975)\nand later became Professor of Pure Mathematics at Vic. Apart from the\nsheer logical talent of those involved in the Wellington group,\nCresswell put the group\u2019s stellar success down to the fact\nthat\u2014unlike much in today\u2019s universities\u2014it was not\na managed creation: it had \u2018just grown and wasn\u2019t\nplanned\u2019.\n\nThe Wellington group, and New Zealand logic more generally, were a\nmagnet for visitors. Angelika Kratzer first visited the group in 1974,\ninitiating an association with the University of Konstanz and\nlogicians in Germany. Others from Germany soon arrived, including\nArnim von Stechow and Rainer B\u00e4uerle. Stanis\u0142aw Surma\nvisited, also in 1974, kick-starting the group\u2019s association\nwith Polish logicians (later, Segerberg hired Surma at Auckland). Dick\nEpstein visited the group from the United States in 1974, and then\nreturned in 1975 for a two-year stay at Vic; while there he worked on\ncomputability and also on what he called \u2018relatedness\nlogic\u2019, a form of relevance logic. Other visitors from North\nAmerica included Doug Walton, who spent the year 1975\u201376 at Vic\nworking on the logic of action. Steve Thomason visited the group in\n1973 while spending a year with Bull at Canterbury, where he worked on\nembedding second-order logic in modal logic and on applying category\ntheory to modal logic.\n\nMike Dunn and Nuel Belnap visited the Wellington group during\n1975\u201376, Donald Davidson in 1977, Leszek Szczerba (a colleague\nof Tarski) in 1977, and Segerberg briefly in 1979 (in 1971 the group\nworked through his recent Ph.D. thesis \u2018An Essay in Classical\nModal Logic\u2019 (Segerberg 1971)). Many others spent time with the\ngroup. David Lewis first visited in 1971, and then for several months\nin 1976, thereafter becoming a regular visitor to New Zealand. Lewis\nand Ken Pledger, another member of the group, shared an enthusiasm for\ntrain timetables, which they exchanged eagerly. Pledger was a geometer\nfrom the Vic mathematics department who\u2014like many\u2014first\nencountered modal logic in Hughes\u2019 and Cresswell\u2019s 1968\nbook. Pledger worked on extensions of S3 and on a modal system lying\nsomewhere between B and S5, and later spent a sabbatical at Warsaw\nUniversity with Szczerba\u2014another geometer\u2014where he\nfinished a Ph.D. on \u2018Some Interrelations between Geometry and\nModal Logic\u2019.\n\nIn 1976 the Wellington group ran a week-long logic school, coinciding\nwith Lewis\u2019s stay. Epstein did much of the organizing. Hughes\nlectured on modal logic and Cresswell on the formal semantics of\nnatural languages\u2014his groundbreaking book Logics and\nLanguages had appeared in 1973. Numerous other group members and\nvisitors lectured on their research. The school \u2018brought out\ninto the open \u2026 a wide variety of quite exciting work \u2026\nthat had in fact been building up over quite a period of time\u2019,\nMalcolm said. The Vic logicians were surprised by the large number of\nenrolments in the school\u2014academics and students from New\nZealand, Australia, and beyond. It was a spectacular shop-window,\nheaped with New Zealand logic. Malcolm later described the school as\nthe Wellington group\u2019s \u2018coming-of-age\u2019.\n\nBy then, the compliment that the founding father of logic in New\nZealand had once paid to California was true also of his own\ncountry. New Zealand had become one of the most logically mature\nplaces in the world for the study of modality and tense.",
