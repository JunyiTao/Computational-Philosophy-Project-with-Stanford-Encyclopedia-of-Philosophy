    "main_text": "Reproductive Choice || Commercial Surrogacy\n3.2 Commercial Surrogacy\n\n\nIt is now possible for individuals or couples to transact for\nreproductive services. New technologies now make possible the creation\nof children whose genes come from people unrelated to the woman who\ngives birth to them or to the people who raise them. For example, a\ncouple can buy eggs from one woman and then implant those eggs in\nanother woman. Or they can implant a man's sperm in a woman who will\nbear the child. \n\n\nOf course, market transactions regarding genetic materials are not\nnew: men have sold sperm in the United States for decades. But\ncontemporary law is unsettled on the issue of commercial surrogacy.\n\n\nThe so-called Baby M case is perhaps the best-known case involving\n\u201csurrogate motherhood\u201d, although the use of the term in\nthis case is, arguably, misleading. Mary Beth Whitehead agreed to be\ninseminated with the sperm of William Stern and to give up any\nresulting child to him and his wife for $10,000. After giving birth to\na child and turning that child over to the Sterns, Whitehead became\ndistraught. A conflict ensued over parental rights, and a New Jersey\ncourt initially gave full custody to the Sterns and discounted the fact\nthat Whitehead was the child's genetic and gestational mother. On\nappeal, the decision was overturned and the surrogacy contract was\ninvalidated. The court granted custody to the Sterns but ordered that\nWhitehead be granted visitation rights.\n\n\nFeminists are divided on the issue of commercial surrogacy. Those\nwho support surrogate motherhood often stress the increase in freedom\nit brings. Surrogate contracts allow women to have additional choices\nover their reproduction. Carmel Shalev (1989) goes further, arguing\nthat prohibiting such contracts fails to give due respect to the\nchoices women do make. If a woman freely enters into a contract to\nproduce a child, it is paternalistic and demeaning to prevent her\nchoice.\n\n\nDefenders of commercial surrogacy also carefully distinguish it from\nbaby selling: children are not sold as commodities, but rather women's\nreproductive services are for sale. Since we allow men to sell their\nsperm, why should women be prevented from participating in an analogous\ntransaction? Finally, defenders point out that commercial surrogacy\noffers new ways for gays and lesbians and single people to become\nparents.\n\n\nCritics of commercial surrogacy likewise offer a diversity of\nobjections. Perhaps the most common objection is based on the claim\nthat gestational labor is different from other types of labor. Margaret\nJane Radin (1988) and Carole Pateman (1983) stress the ways that the\nlabor of bearing a child is more intimately bound up with a woman's\nidentity than other types of labor. Contract pregnancy involves an\nalienation of aspects of the self so extreme as to make it an\nillegitimate practice. Selling sperm is not analogous: the work of\npregnancy is long-term, complex and involves an emotional and physical\nbonding between mother and fetus. (See also Rich 1976 for a\nbrilliant phenomenology of pregnancy.)\n\n\nElizabeth Anderson (1990) echoes this objection, but adds that\nsurrogacy contracts also alienate a woman from her love for the child\nand frequently involve exploitation, as surrogate sellers have less\nwealth and are more emotionally vulnerable than buyers. Other\nobjections stress the weakening of the link between parent and child,\nand the special vulnerability of children.\n\n\nSatz (1992) argues that there are limits to the objections based on an\nintimate connection between reproductive labor and our selves. Writers\nare intimately bound up with their writing, but they also want to be\npaid for their novels. Further, if the link between mother and\nfetus/reproductive labor is so strong, how can abortion be justified?\nInstead, Satz's argument stresses the background context of commercial\nsurrogacy: the gender inequality in modern society. Commercial\nsurrogacy allows women's labor to be used and controlled by others,\nand reinforces stereotypes about women. For example, pregnancy\ncontracts give buyers substantial control rights over women's bodies:\nrights to determine what the women eat, drink and do. They also may\ndeepen stereotypes: that women are baby-machines. Finally, the race\nand class dimensions of such markets also need to be considered. In\nanother well known case involving commercial surrogacy, a judge\nreferred to the African American women who gave birth to a child with\ngenes from a white father and a Philippina mother as the baby's\n\u201cwet-nurse\u201d and refused to grant her any visitation rights\nto see the child.\nInterestingly, practices such as in vitro fertilization, commercial\nsurrogacy and egg and gamete markets are largely unregulated. There\nare also huge for profit agencies involved in these ways of making a\nbaby.  By contrast, adoption is highly regulated: prospective parents\nhave to submit to intrusive interviews and home visits.  It is worth\nreflecting on this differential treatment, especially since many\nreproductive technologies also involve vulnerable third parties (Spar\n2006).\n",
