    "main_text": "A First Pass at the Subject Matter || What is Cognitive Science?\n1.1 What is Cognitive Science?\n\nCognitive science is an interdisciplinary approach to studying minds,\nmental organization, and intelligent behavior (Thagard 1997 [2019]).\nThe field has developed over the last 70 years, incorporating research\nfrom across more traditional disciplines like psychology, philosophy,\nlinguistics, logic, computer science, anthropology, economics,\nevolutionary theory, and neuroscience (though see N\u00fa\u00f1ez\net al. 2019 for doubts about the extent to which these have succeeded\nin uniting into a distinctive field; cf. Stanford 2020). As these\ndisciplines converged on the same types of questions from different\ndirections, a loose cluster of shared concepts, methodological\nassumptions, experimental paradigms, and theoretical goals emerged.\nTogether, the elements of this cluster have served as a productive\nframework for constructing theories and guiding ongoing research about\nbehavior, minds, and mentality (Pylyshyn 1984; Lycan & Prinz 2008;\nBrook 2009; Samuels, Margolis, & Stich 2012).\n\nAt the heart of the framework is the idea that minds and mental\nactivity can be understood not as any particular kind of substance,\nbut rather as some form of information processing. The currently most\nintuitive and probably still dominant version of the idea is expressed\nwith the computer analogy, though some have argued that antecedents\nand earlier versions of the core insight can be found as far back as\nAristotle\u2019s doctrine of hylomorphism and its distinction between\nmatter and form (Shields 1991; Nussbaum & Putnam 1992; cf. Nelson\n1990; Olshewsky 1992). The computer analogy holds that the relation\nbetween the physical and mental aspects of a person, between bodies\nand minds, between the physical and the mental more generally, can be\nunderstood on the model of the relation between hardware and software\n(Putnam 1967). On this view, mental states are functional states\nidentified by the role they play in the \u201cprogram\u201d that\nchannels information through and guides the control system of a\nphysical body. Mental processes, then, are understood as computational\nprocesses performed on mental representations, symbols that have both\nsyntactic and semantic properties, and that are usually but not\nnecessarily realized in brains. Mental processes and representations\ncan be modeled using the formal resources of computation theory, with\nsyntactic relations between the mental representations encoding\npatterns of causal relations that hold between the physical states\nthat realize them (Fodor 1975; Stich 1983; Rescorla 2015 [2020]). In\nthe last several decades, aspects of this orthodoxy have been\nchallenged, especially regarding the existence and character of mental\nrepresentations (Pitt 2000 [2020]). Several alternatives to and\nextensions of this \u201cclassical computationalist\u201d way of\nunderstanding information processing have made inroads into cognitive\nscience, and have been discussed by philosophers under the headings of\nconnectionism (Buckner & Garson 2019), embodied cognition (Clark\n1997a; Shapiro 2011; R. Wilson & Foglia 2011 [2021]), enactivism\n(Hutto & Myin 2013; Di Paolo & Thompson 2014), dynamic systems\napproaches (Chemero 2009; M. Anderson 2014), complexity science\n(Favela 2020), and predictive processing (Hohwy 2013; Clark 2016).\n\nStill, the core idea of mental activity as information processing of\nsome sort remains compelling, in part because the differences between\nthe classical computationalist approach and these newer alternatives\nmay not be very deep (Cao 2020), but also due to the clear research\nagenda it suggests. The general aim of cognitive science can be cast\nas the attempt to understand minds and cognition by trying to\nunderstand the nature and limits of computation and other forms of\ninformation processing, and by trying to determine the character and\nprovenance of the programs our brains, and the brains of non-human\nanimals, typically run. It also suggests a suite of more specific\nquestions: How malleable are the different programs? How much of the\ninformation and processing structure is innately specified? How much\nand which elements are acquired via various forms of learning over the\ncourse of development, and throughout different stages of a lifetime?\nWhat is the character of the information processing that underlies\ndifferent psychological capacities such as vision and visual\nconsciousness, language acquisition and comprehension, individual and\nsocial learning, emotion and affect, memory and imagination, skilled\nbehavior and deliberation, decision-making and moral judgment, and so\nforth?\n\nThese broad questions and the general conceptual framework that is\ncommon to them give the different disciplines that make up cognitive\nscience a base camp and a lingua franca with which to pursue different\nhypotheses about minds, mental organization, and intelligent behavior.\nTogether they aim to provide a coherent way to bring together and\ncompare different kinds of theoretical, formal, and empirical work to\nbear on a core set of questions.\n",
