    "main_text": "Terminology\n1. Terminology\n\n\u201cTheism\u201d will here refer to the view that there is a God\nwho is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent, who created the\nworld, and who is still actively involved in the world.\n\nIn philosophical discussions about God and time, the term\n\u201ceternity\u201d has been used in different ways. On one usage,\nwhich will be followed here, \u201ceternity\u201d stands for the\nrelationship to time that God has, whatever it is. When used in that\nway, the term is neutral between different ways of spelling out what\nGod\u2019s relationship to time is. Western theists agree that God is\neternal; the task is to formulate and assess conceptions of what this\neternality might amount to.\n\nBroadly speaking, there have been two rival views of what God\u2019s\neternality consists in. On the first, God is timeless (divine\ntimelessness); on the second, God is in time (divine temporality).\nSometimes the term \u201ceternity\u201d is used to denote\ntimelessness, but as mentioned, we will here use it as neutral between\nthe timeless and temporal views. The term \u201ceverlasting\u201d\n(or \u201csempiternal\u201d) on the other hand, is mostly associated\nwith the temporal view. On the temporal view, God is in time and thus\nexists at every time; there is no time at which God doesn\u2019t\nexist.\n",
