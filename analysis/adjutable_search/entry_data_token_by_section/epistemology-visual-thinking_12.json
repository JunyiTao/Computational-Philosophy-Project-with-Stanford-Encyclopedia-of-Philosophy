    "main_text": "A priori and a posteriori roles of visual experience || An evidential use of visual experience in proving\n6.2 An evidential use of visual experience in proving\nMany cases of proving something (or following a proof of it)\ninvolve making, or imagining making, changes in a symbol array. A\nstandard presentation of the proof of left-cancellation in group\ntheory provides an example. \u201cLeft-cancellation\u201d is the\nclaim that for any members \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) of a group with\noperation \\(\\cdot\\) and identity element \\(\\mathbf{e}\\), if \\(a \\cdot\nb = a \\cdot c\\), then \\(b = c\\). Here is (the core of) a proof of\nit: \\begin{align*} a \\cdot b &= a \\cdot c\\\\ a^{-1} \\cdot (a\n\\cdot b) &= a^{-1} \\cdot (a \\cdot c)\\\\ (a^{-1} \\cdot a) \\cdot b\n&= (a^{-1} \\cdot a) \\cdot c\\\\ \\mathbf{e}\\cdot b &= \\mathbf{e}\n\\cdot c\\\\ b &= c.  \\end{align*}\n\nSuppose that one comes to know left-cancellation by following this\nsequence of steps. Is this an a priori way of getting this\nknowledge? Although following a mathematical proof is thought to be a\nparadigmatically a priori way of getting knowledge, attention\nto the role of visual experience here throws this into doubt. The case\nfor claiming that the visual experience has an evidential role is as\nfollows.\nThe visual experience reveals not only what the steps of the\nargument are but also that they are valid, thereby contributing to our\ngrounds for accepting the argument and believing its conclusion.\nConsider, for example, the step from the second equation to the third.\nThe relevant background knowledge, apart from the logic of identity,\nis that a group operation is associative. This fact is usually\nrepresented in the form of an equation that simply relocates brackets\nin an obvious way: \\[ x \\cdot (y \\cdot z) = (x \\cdot y) \\cdot z \\]\n\nWe see that relocating the brackets in accord with this format, the\nleft-hand term of the second equation is transformed into the\nleft-hand term of the third equation, and the same for the right-hand\nterms. So the visual experience plays an evidential role in our\nrecognising as valid the step from the second equation to the\nthird. Hence this quite standard route to knowledge of\nleft-cancellation turns out to be a posteriori, even though\nit is a clear case of following a proof.\nAgainst this, one may argue that the description just given of what\nis going on in following the proof is not strictly correct, as\nfollows.  Exactly the same proof can be expressed in natural language,\nusing \u201cthe composition of \\(x\\) with \\(y\\)\u201d for \u201c\\(x\n\\cdot y\\)\u201d, but the result would be hard to take in. Or the\nproof can be presented using a different notational convention, one\nwhich forces a quite different expression of associativity. For\nexample, we can use the Polish convention of putting the operation\nsymbol before the operands: instead of \u201c\\(x \\cdot y\\)\u201d we\nput \u201c\\(\\cdot x y\\)\u201d.  In that case associativity would be\nexpressed in the following way, without brackets: \\[ \\cdot x \\cdot\ny z = \\cdot \\cdot x y z.  \\]\n\nThe equations of the proof would then need to be re-symbolised; but\nwhat is expressed by each equation after re-symbolisation and the\nsteps from one to the next would be exactly as before. So we would be\nfollowing the very same proof, step by step. But we would not be using\nvisual experiences involved to notice the relocation of brackets this\ntime. This suggests that the role of the different visual experiences\ninvolved in following the argument in its different guises is merely\nto give us access to the common reasoning: the role of the experience\nis merely enabling. On this account the visual experience does not\nstrictly and literally enable us to see that any of the steps are\nvalid; rather, recognition of (or sensitivity to) the validity of the\nsteps results from cognitive processing at a more abstract level.\nWhich of these rival views is correct? Does our visual experience\nin following the argument presented with brackets (1) reveal to us the\nvalidity of some of the steps, given the relevant background knowledge\n? Or (2) merely give us access to the argument? The core of the\nargument against view (1) is this:\n\nSeeing the relocation of brackets is not essential to following the\nargument.\nSo seeing merely gives access to the argument; it does not reveal\nany step to be valid.\n\nThe step to this conclusion is faulty. How one follows a proof may,\nand in this case does, depend on how it is presented, and different\nways of following a proof may be different ways of coming to know its\nconclusion. While seeing the relocation of brackets is not essential\nto all ways of following this argument, it is essential to the normal\nway of following the argument when it is symbolically presented with\nbrackets in the way given above.\nAssociativity, expressed without symbols, is this: When the binary\ngroup operation is applied twice in succession on an ordered triple of\noperands \\(\\langle a, b, c\\rangle\\), it makes no difference whether\nthe first application is to the initial two operands or the final two\noperands. While this is the content of associativity, for ease of\nprocessing associativity is almost always expressed as a\nsymbol-manipulation rule. Visual perception is used to tell in\nparticular cases whether the rule thus expressed is correctly\nimplemented, in the context of prior knowledge that the rule is\ncorrect. What is going on here is a familiar division of labour in\nmathematical thinking. We first establish the soundness of a rule of\nsymbol-manipulation (in terms of the governing semantic\nconventions\u2014in this case the matter is trivial); then we check\nvisually that the rule is correctly implemented. Processing at a more\nabstract, semantic level is often harder than processing at a purely\nsyntactic level; it is for this reason that we often resort to\nsymbol-manipulation techniques as proxy for reasoning directly with\nmeanings to solve a problem. (What is six eighths divided by\nthree fifths, without using any symbolic technique?) When we do use\nsymbol-manipulation in proving or following a proof, visual experience\nis required to discern that the moves conform to permitted patterns\nand thus contributes to our grounds for accepting the argument. Then\nthe way of coming to know the conclusion has an a posteriori\nelement.\n",
