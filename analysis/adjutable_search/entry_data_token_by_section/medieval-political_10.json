    "main_text": "Augustine || Coercion of Heretics\n4.3 Coercion of Heretics\n\nIn accordance with Augustine\u2019s view of warfare, Christians were\nentitled to ask the Roman authorities, including those among them who\nwere Christian, for military protection against the violence of\nheretics and anti-Christians. But it was a further step to ask the\nauthorities to coerce heretics to convert them to orthodox\n Christianity.[16]\n At first Augustine disapproved of such coercion: \u201cA man cannot\nbelieve unless he is willing\u201d\n (Tractates on the Gospel of John, XXVI.2).\n But after a while he was persuaded and became an advocate of the use\nof force to \u201ccompel them to come in\u201d\n (Luke 14:16\u201324).[17]\n He was persuaded by converted Donatists who expressed gratitude to\nthose who had compelled them to convert\n (Letter 93 V.17\u201319).\n\nAccording to Augustine, the property of heretical sects may rightly be\nconfiscated\n (Tractates on the Gospel of John, VI.25),\n in which Augustine justifies government seizure of Donatist property.\nHe does not argue that only orthodox Christians can rightly possess\nproperty. Rather, his point is that whoever possesses property\npossesses it only by virtue of human laws made by kings and emperors.\nTherefore, if the ruler decides to confiscate the property of\nheretics, he has the right to do so. This passage, which Gratian\nquoted in the Decretum (D. 8 c. 1), was often used in the\nmiddle ages to support the doctrine that property exists only by human\nlaw. Gratian\u2019s extensive use of Augustine in the\nDecretum arguably greatly increased Augustine\u2019s\ninfluence on the topic of warfare, property, and the coercion of\nheretics (for Augustine\u2019s views on property, see MacQueen\n1972).\n",
