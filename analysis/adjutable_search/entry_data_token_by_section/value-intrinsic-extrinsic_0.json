What Has Intrinsic Value?\n\nThe question \u201cWhat is intrinsic value?\u201d is more\nfundamental than the question \u201cWhat has intrinsic value?,\u201d\nbut historically these have been treated in reverse order. For a long\ntime, philosophers appear to have thought that the notion of intrinsic\nvalue is itself sufficiently clear to allow them to go straight to the\nquestion of what should be said to have intrinsic value. Not even a\npotted history of what has been said on this matter can be attempted\nhere, since the record is so rich. Rather, a few representative\nillustrations must suffice.\n\nIn his dialogue Protagoras, Plato [428\u2013347 B.C.E.]\nmaintains (through the character of Socrates, modeled after the real\nSocrates [470\u2013399 B.C.E.], who was Plato\u2019s teacher) that,\nwhen people condemn pleasure, they do so, not because they take\npleasure to be bad as such, but because of the bad consequences they\nfind pleasure often to have. For example, at one point Socrates says\nthat the only reason why the pleasures of food and drink and sex seem\nto be evil is that they result in pain and deprive us of future\npleasures (Plato, Protagoras, 353e). He concludes that\npleasure is in fact good as such and pain bad, regardless of what\ntheir consequences may on occasion be. In the Timaeus, Plato\nseems quite pessimistic about these consequences, for he has Timaeus\ndeclare pleasure to be \u201cthe greatest incitement to evil\u201d\nand pain to be something that \u201cdeters from good\u201d (Plato,\nTimaeus, 69d). Plato does not think of pleasure as the\n\u201chighest\u201d good, however. In the Republic,\nSocrates states that there can be no \u201ccommunion\u201d between\n\u201cextravagant\u201d pleasure and virtue (Plato,\nRepublic, 402e) and in the Philebus, where Philebus\nargues that pleasure is the highest good, Socrates argues against\nthis, claiming that pleasure is better when accompanied by\nintelligence (Plato, Philebus, 60e).\n\nMany philosophers have followed Plato\u2019s lead in declaring\npleasure intrinsically good and pain intrinsically bad. Aristotle\n[384\u2013322 B.C.E.], for example, himself a student of\nPlato\u2019s, says at one point that all are agreed that pain is bad\nand to be avoided, either because it is bad \u201cwithout\nqualification\u201d or because it is in some way an\n\u201cimpediment\u201d to us; he adds that pleasure, being the\n\u201ccontrary\u201d of that which is to be avoided, is therefore\nnecessarily a good (Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 1153b).\nOver the course of the more than two thousand years since this was\nwritten, this view has been frequently endorsed. Like Plato, Aristotle\ndoes not take pleasure and pain to be the only things that are\nintrinsically good and bad, although some have maintained that this is\nindeed the case. This more restrictive view, often called hedonism,\nhas had proponents since the time of Epicurus [341\u2013271\n B.C.E.].[1]\n Perhaps the most thorough renditions of it are to be found in the\nworks of Jeremy Bentham [1748\u20131832] and Henry Sidgwick\n[1838\u20131900] (see Bentham 1789, Sidgwick 1907); perhaps its most\nfamous proponent is John Stuart Mill [1806\u20131873] (see Mill\n1863).\n\nMost philosophers who have written on the question of what has\nintrinsic value have not been hedonists; like Plato and Aristotle,\nthey have thought that something besides pleasure and pain has\nintrinsic value. One of the most comprehensive lists of intrinsic\ngoods that anyone has suggested is that given by William Frankena\n(Frankena 1973, pp. 87\u201388): life, consciousness, and activity;\nhealth and strength; pleasures and satisfactions of all or certain\nkinds; happiness, beatitude, contentment, etc.; truth; knowledge and\ntrue opinions of various kinds, understanding, wisdom; beauty,\nharmony, proportion in objects contemplated; aesthetic experience;\nmorally good dispositions or virtues; mutual affection, love,\nfriendship, cooperation; just distribution of goods and evils; harmony\nand proportion in one\u2019s own life; power and experiences of\nachievement; self-expression; freedom; peace, security; adventure and\nnovelty; and good reputation, honor, esteem, etc. (Presumably a\ncorresponding list of intrinsic evils could be provided.) Almost any\nphilosopher who has ever addressed the question of what has intrinsic\nvalue will find his or her answer represented in some way by one or\nmore items on Frankena\u2019s list. (Frankena himself notes that he\ndoes not explicitly include in his list the communion with and love\nand knowledge of God that certain philosophers believe to be the\nhighest good, since he takes them to fall under the headings of\n\u201cknowledge\u201d and \u201clove.\u201d) One conspicuous\nomission from the list, however, is the increasingly popular view that\ncertain environmental entities or qualities have intrinsic value\n(although Frankena may again assert that these are implicitly\nrepresented by one or more items already on the list). Some find\nintrinsic value, for example, in certain \u201cnatural\u201d\nenvironments (wildernesses untouched by human hand); some find it in\ncertain animal species; and so on.\n\nSuppose that you were confronted with some proposed list of intrinsic\ngoods. It would be natural to ask how you might assess the accuracy of\nthe list. How can you tell whether something has intrinsic value or\nnot? On one level, this is an epistemological question about which\nthis article will not be concerned. (See the entry in this\nencyclopedia on moral epistemology.) On another level, however, this\nis a conceptual question, for we cannot be sure that something has\nintrinsic value unless we understand what it is for something to have\nintrinsic value.\n",
