    "main_text": "Defining Culture\n1. Defining Culture\n\nDefining the term \u201cculture\u201d is very challenging: it has\nbeen described as both a \u201cnotoriously overbroad concept\u201d\n(Song 2009: 177) and a \u201cnotoriously ambiguous concept\u201d\n(Eisenberg 2009: 7). It is deployed in multiple ways: as the entry\nwill go on to consider in more length, the term \u201cculture\u201d\ncan refer to the set of norms, practices and values that characterize\nminority and majority groups, for example by noting that the Hasidic\nJewish communities in New York practice a unique\n\u201cculture\u201d, or by describing Italian or Senegalese culture.\nBut it is also used in other ways, for example, to refer to\n\u201cbro\u201d culture or \u201chipster\u201d culture, or the\nculture of British football fans. Moreover, any one person can be a\nmember of multiple cultures\u2014someone (like this writer!) can be a\nmember of the Canadian culture, the Ottawan culture, the Jewish\nculture, and the academic culture at the same time. Contextual\nconsiderations will explain why the norms, practices, and values that\ndefine each of these cultures become relevant at a particular moment.\nMoreover, only some of these cultures have political and legal\nrelevance; only those that do are the focus of this entry.\n\nIn the political and legal spheres, there is widespread disagreement\nabout what culture is, and the next section is focused on\nelaborating these distinct views of culture. There is however\nconsiderable agreement that whatever it is, it matters to\npeople and the meaning and value it provides to the lives of\nindividuals are among the most important reasons, if not the most\nimportant ones, to defend and protect it in legal and political\nspaces. This value is why it is important to attempt to\ndiscover what culture is and correspondingly why, and which aspects of\nit in particular, should or should not be protected in the public\nsphere. Notice that the observation that cultures are valuable to\npeople, and indeed that they bring value to the lives of individuals,\nis not the same as saying that individual cultural practices are all\ngood. Any defensible account of culture must take seriously the\nimportance of culture in general without defending all of its\ninstantiations. There are four main ways in which culture has been\ninterpreted: as an encompassing group, as social formation, in\ndialogic terms, and in identity terms.\n",
