    "main_text": "The Role(s) of Decoherence in Different Approaches to Quantum Mechanics || Orthodox approaches\n3.4 Orthodox approaches\n3.4.1 Von Neumann\n\nIn the final Chapter VI of his book (von Neumann 1932), von Neumann\nprovided a systematic discussion of quantum mechanics with collapse\nupon measurement (described by what he calls an intervention of type\n\\(\\mathbf{1})\\), as distinct from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n(intervention of type \\(\\mathbf{2})\\), and traditionally associated with a\nrole for conscious observation. (The two types of interventions are\nintroduced already in Section V.1, but von Neumann postpones their\nconceptual discussion to the final chapter.)\n\nIn actual fact, von Neumann starts his discussion by pointing out that\nmeasurements are different from other physical processes both\nphenomenologically and by presupposing conscious observation. But he\ninsists on preserving what he calls \u2018psycho-physical\nparallelism\u2019, requiring that the process of observation be\ndescribable also in purely physical terms. He thus requires that a\nboundary be drawn between the \u2018observed\u2019 and the\n\u2018observer\u2019, but also crucially that this boundary be\nmovable arbitrarily far towards the observer end. (Note that\nvon Neumann stops short of at least explicitly attributing to\nconsciousness a causal role in collapsing the quantum state.)\n\nVon Neumann thus needs to show that the final predictions for what we\nconsciously observe are insensitive to how far along such a\n\u2018measurement chain\u2019 one chooses to continue applying\nintervention \\(\\mathbf{2}\\), thus ensuring that every step in the process of\nobservation can be described purely in physical terms. In von\nNeumann\u2019s example of a measurement of temperature, we need not\napply intervention \\(\\mathbf{1}\\) to the system itself, but may apply it to\nthe thermometer, or to the retina in the eye, or to the optic nerve,\nor anywhere else within the physical realm between the system and the\n\u2018abstract ego\u2019 of the observer. By the same token,\nhowever, we can (much more practically!) apply it also directly to the\nmeasured system. \n\nAs a preliminary, von Neumann discusses the relation between states of\nsystems and subsystems, in particular the notion of partial trace and\nthe biorthogonal decomposition theorem (i.e. the theorem stating that\nan entangled quantum state can always be written in terms of perfect\ncorrelations between two special bases for the subsystems). He also\nshows (as mentioned above) that the usual statistics of measurements\ncannot be recovered by assuming that the \u2018observer\u2019 is\ninitially in a mixed state. He then proves that it is always possible\nto define an interaction Hamiltonian that will correlate perfectly the\neigenstates of any given observable of an \u2018observed\u2019\nsystem with the eigenstates of some other suitable observable of an\n\u2018observer\u2019, leaving as an exercise for the reader to show\nthat predictions are independent of where one places the boundary\nbetween the two.\n\nWhat the reader is supposed to do is to imagine a series of such\ninteractions, between the system and the thermometer, between the\nthermometer and the light, between the light and the retina, etc., and\nrely on the absence of interference at each step to argue that,\neven if we describe a number of systems using intervention \\(\\mathbf{2}\\),\nthey behave for the purpose of the application of intervention\n\\(\\mathbf{1}\\) as if they had collapsed already. In this sense, even\nthough he is quite clearly not thinking in terms of mechanisms for\nsuppressing interference, he is relying on decoherence. A fuller\ntreatment (e.g. a detailed model of how the thermometer interacts with\nlight, and some of the light is then sampled by the eye) would\nresemble more closely an analysis in terms of environmental\ndecoherence. \n3.4.2 Heisenberg\n\nSimilar considerations may be made about Heisenberg\u2019s views on\nquantum mechanics, even though Heisenberg\u2019s conceptual framework\nis arguably rather different from von Neumann\u2019s.\n\nFor Heisenberg, the application of quantum mechanics requires a\n\u2018cut\u2019 between the system to be described quantum\nmechanically, and what is to be considered external to the system and\nis to be treated classically. Indeed, if one were to apply quantum\nmechanics to the entire universe, one would have a perfectly closed\nsystem in which nothing would ever happen. But Heisenberg places\nspecial emphasis on the idea that any special system must be\ndescribable using quantum mechanics (indeed, that such a system is in\nprinciple always able to display interference effects if placed under\nthe appropriate\n conditions[33]).\n Self-consistency of the theory then requires the arbitrary\nmovability of the cut away from the system. (The most detailed\npresentation of these ideas is in Heisenberg\u2019s draft reply to\nthe\n Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen argument\n \u2013 see Crull and Bacciagaluppi (2011) in the\n Other Internet Resources.)\n\nIf one thinks about some of the examples that Heisenberg considers to\nbe measurements, it is even clearer than in von Neumann\u2019s case\nthat the movability of the Heisenberg cut in fact requires\ndecoherence. In particular, his discussion of \\(\\alpha\\)-particle tracks\ninvolves successive measurements whenever the \\(\\alpha\\)-particle\nionises an atom in a cloud chamber. If we require that the Heisenberg\ncut be movable to the level of the entire cloud chamber, we shift\ndirectly to a Mott-type analysis of the \\(\\alpha\\)-particle tracks.\n\nOne further aspect that is characteristic for Heisenberg and that\nprima facie does not fit with the theory of decoherence, is\nthat Heisenberg does not take quantum states as fundamental.\nFor him, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s notion of a \u2018state\u2019 was\njust a mathematical artifact that is convenient for calculating\ntransition probabilities between values of (measured) observables.\nThis can also be seen as underpinning the movability of the cut: there\nis no matter of fact about when the collapse takes place, and all that\nmatters physically are the transition probabilities between values of\nobservables. This view is still compatible with decoherence, however,\nas long as one sees the role of the quantum state there as again just\na convenient tool for calculating transition probabilities (say, in a\ndecoherent histories\n framework).[34]\n3.4.3 Bohr\n\nBohr shared with von Neumann and with Heisenberg the idea that that\nquantum mechanics is in principle applicable to any physical system\n(as shown e.g. by his willingness in the course of his debates with\nEinstein to apply the uncertainty relations to parts of the\nexperimental apparatus when not used as an apparatus), while\ndenying that it is meaningful to apply it to the entire universe. What\nis central to Bohr\u2019s views, however, is not so much the\nmovability of the cut within a given experimental arrangement, but the\nfact that different experimental arrangements will generally select\ncomplementary aspects of the description of a physical system,\ncorresponding to different equally necessary classical pictures that\nhowever cannot be combined. In this sense, for Bohr classical concepts\nare conceptually prior to quantum mechanics. In a terminology\nreminiscent of Kant, the quantum state is not an anschaulich\n(\u2018intuitive\u2019) representation of a quantum object, but only\na symbolic representation, a shorthand for the quantum\nphenomena that are constituted by applying the various complementary\nclassical pictures. (See also the entry on the\n Copenhagen interpretation.)\n\nThus, if we understand the theory of decoherence as pointing to how\nclassical concepts might in fact emerge from quantum mechanics, we see\na tension with Bohr\u2019s basic position. According to decoherence,\neven though classical concepts are autonomous in the sense of being\nemergent, they are not fundamentally prior to quantum\nmechanics. In another sense, however, decoherence does support\nBohr\u2019s point of view, because we can see decoherence (in\nparticular environmental decoherence) as suggesting that there are no\nquantum phenomena without classical records: it is the\nsuppression of interference that creates the conditions for restoring\nthe objectivity that gets lost through what Bohr sees as the loss of\nindependent reality attaching to both the system and the measuring\n apparatus.[35]\n\n\nBoth of these aspects can be seen in the reception of Everett\u2019s\nideas by Bohr and his circle. While Everett saw his own theory as\ndirectly opposed to von Neumann\u2019s approach, he believed that he\ncould provide a justification for Bohr\u2019s idea of\ncomplementarity. Bohr, however, rejected the attempt to apply the\nnotion of quantum state to a description of the whole universe. (The\nrejection of Everett\u2019s ideas in Copenhagen in fact rather\ntragically contributed to Everett leaving physics in favour of\nmilitary operations\n research.[36])\n \n3.5 Other approaches\n3.5.1 Nelson\u2019s stochastic mechanics\n\nNelson\u2019s (1966, 1985) stochastic mechanics is a proposal to\nrecover the wave function and the Schr\u00f6dinger equation as\neffective elements in the description of a fundamental diffusion\nprocess in configuration space. Insofar as the proposal is\n successful,[37]\n it shares many features with de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory. Indeed,\nthe current velocity for the particles in Nelson\u2019s theory turns\nout to be equal to the de Broglie\u2013Bohm velocity, and the\nparticle distribution in Nelson\u2019s theory is equal to that in de\nBroglie\u2013Bohm theory (in equilibrium).\n\nIt follows that many results from pilot-wave theories can be imported\ninto Nelson\u2019s stochastic mechanics, including those based on\ndecoherence. In particular, the strategies used in pilot-wave\ntheories to recover the appearance of collapse and the emergence of a\nclassical regime can be applied also to the case of stochastic\nmechanics, even though so far very little has been done along these\nlines. Doing so will arguably also resolve some conceptual puzzles\nspecific to Nelson\u2019s theory, such as the problem of two-time\ncorrelations raised in Nelson\n (2006).[38]\n\n3.5.2 Modal interpretations\n\nThe first \u2018modal interpretation\u2019 of quantum mechanics was\nproposed by Van Fraassen (1973, 1991), and was strictly an\ninterpretation of the theory (while other later versions came more to\nresemble pilot-wave theories; see the entry on\n modal interpretations).\n Van Fraassen\u2019s basic intuition was that the quantum state of a\nsystem should be understood as describing a collection of\npossibilities, represented by components in the (mixed) quantum state.\nHis proposal considers only decompositions at single instants, and is\nagnostic about re-identification over time. Thus, it can directly\nexploit only the fact that decoherence produces descriptions in terms\nof classical-like states, which will count as possibilities in Van\nFraassen\u2019s sense. This ensures \u2018empirical adequacy\u2019\nof the quantum description (crucial in Van Fraassen\u2019s\n constructive empiricism).\n The dynamical aspects of decoherence can be exploited indirectly, in\nthat single-time components will exhibit records of the past,\nwhich ensure adequacy with respect to observations, but about whose\nveridicity Van Fraassen remains agnostic.\n\nA different strand of modal interpretations is loosely associated with\nthe (distinct) views of Kochen (1985), Healey (1989) and Dieks (see\ne.g. Dieks and Vermaas 1998). We focus on the last of these to fix\nideas. Van Fraassen\u2019s possible decompositions are restricted to\none singled out by a mathematical criterion (related to the\nbiorthogonal decomposition theorem mentioned above in\n Section 3.4.1),\n and a dynamical picture is explicitly sought (and was later\ndeveloped). In the case of an ideal (non-approximate) quantum\nmeasurement, this special decomposition coincides with that defined by\nthe eigenstates of the measured observable and the corresponding\npointer states, and the interpretation thus appears to solve the\nmeasurement problem (for this case at least). In\nDieks\u2019s original intentions, the approach was meant to provide\nan attractive interpretation of quantum mechanics also in the case of\ndecoherence interactions, since at least in simple models of\ndecoherence the same kind of decomposition singles out more or less\nalso those states between which interference is suppressed (with a\nproviso about very degenerate states).\n\nInterestingly, this approach fails when applied to other models of\ndecoherence, e.g., that in Joos and Zeh (1985, Section III.2). Indeed,\nit appears that in more general models of decoherence the components\nsingled out by this version of the modal interpretation are given by\ndelocalised states, and are unrelated to the localised\ncomponents naturally privileged by decoherence (Donald 1998;\nBacciagaluppi 2000). Thus the relation with decoherence has been the\ntouchstone for these versions of the modal interpretation. Note that\nVan Fraassen\u2019s original interpretation is untouched by this\nproblem, and so are possibly some more recent modal or modal-like\ninterpretations by Spekkens and Sipe (2001), Bene and Dieks (2002),\nand Berkovitz and Hemmo (2006).\n\nThe general idea of modal interpretations, more or less in the spirit\nof Van Fraassen, can be applied more widely. For one thing, it is\ncognate to some of the views expressed in the decoherent histories\nliterature. Decoherent histories could be seen as alternative possible\nhistories of the world, one of which is in fact actualised. A\ndiscussion in these terms has been outlined by Hemmo (1996). Such\nviews are also possibly quite close to Everett\u2019s own views, who\n(maybe surprisingly for the modern reader) was not a realist but an\nempiricist. A discussion of Everett with parallels to Van Fraassen is\ngiven by Barrett (2015). One final view that has some similarities\nwith Van Fraassen\u2019s and should be equally able to exploit the\nresults of decoherence is Rovelli\u2019s\n relational quantum mechanics\n (see also Van Fraassen 2010).\n3.5.3 QBism\n\nQBism (originally short for \u2018quantum Bayesianism\u2019) is a\nview of quantum mechanics developed by Chris Fuchs and co-workers,\nwhich has made current the idea that subjective probabilities \u00e0\nla de Finetti can be used also in quantum mechanics (see the entry on\n quantum Bayesian and pragmatist views of quantum theory).\n The position is more radical than this, however, in that it does not\nonly claim that the quantum probabilities as defined by the quantum\nstate should be interpreted subjectively, but that the quantum state\nitself is merely an expression of an agent\u2019s degrees of\n belief.[39]\n\nThe role of decoherence in QBism is rather downplayed. E.g. Fuchs and\nSchack (2012, Section 7) see it in light of the reflection principle\n(concerning an agent\u2019s beliefs about their future beliefs).\nSpecifically, in the context of a von Neumann measurement chain, an\nagent can use the state of the system as decohered by some later\nelements of the chain as an expression of their beliefs about what\ntheir beliefs will be after the previous elements of the measurement\nchain have been completed. (And of course, the results of decoherence\ncan be taken into account if an agent is considering making\nmeasurements on a system that is in interaction with some\nenvironment.) Because they are subjectivists not just about\nprobabilities but also about the quantum state, however, what QBists\ncannot exploit is the relevance of decoherence to the emergence of the\nentire classical world in which (human) agents have in fact evolved\n\u2013 unless, that is, agents are not treated as agents but\nas mere physical systems. The QBist\u2019s predicament thus is\nsimilar to Bohr\u2019s: decoherence clearly appears to be relevant to\nthe emergence of the very structures that are deemed to be\nconceptually prior to their analysis of quantum mechanics itself.\n\n4. Scope of Decoherence\n\nWe have seen in the last section that not all approaches to quantum\nmechanics can make full use of decoherence. In those approaches that\ncan, however, decoherence is instrumental in yielding a wealth of\nstructures that emerge from the unitary Schr\u00f6dinger (or\nHeisenberg) dynamics. How far can this programme of\ndecoherence (Zeh 2003a, p. 9) be successfully developed? \n4.1 The world according to decoherence\n\nWhat seems very clear is that decoherence is crucial for the emergence\nof much of the macroscopic world around us, from the motions in the\nsolar system (cf. the discussion of the motion of Saturn\u2019s moon\nHyperion \u2013 for an assessment of which see Schlosshauer (2008))\nand down to the working of enzymes (which relies on their molecular\nshapes). The detailed picture of the world that emerges from\ndecoherence, however, is full of subtleties.\n\nFor one thing, while the more \u2018macroscopic\u2019 a system, the\nmore pervasive the effects of decoherence and the more complex the\nstructures that emerge through it, this is only a rule of thumb. Not\nall molecules are chiral (bound ammonia groups tend to be\nin superpositions for instance), and there is no clear-cut criterion\nfor when a system should count as macroscopic. Indeed, even apart from\nexamples like superconducting systems, there might be surprising cases\nin which not all interference effects have been suppressed by\ndecoherence even at the macroscopic level. A famous proposal by\nHameroff and Penrose (1996) links the phenomenon of consciousness with\nthe possibility of quantum superpositions within microtubules (and\ntheir subsequent active suppression via collapse); other authors\ninterpret the mathematically quantum-like effects described within\n\u2018quantum cognition\u2019 as actual quantum effects (for both, see the\nentry on\n quantum approaches to consciousness).\n At present, most macroscopic quantum effects remain speculative at\nbest, but plausible cases for the continuing relevance of quantum\nsuperpositions at the macroscopic level can be found in quantum\nbiology, notably the studies of possible quantum effects in the\nnavigational system of migrating birds (Cai, Guerreschi and Briegel\n2010).\n\nCloser to home, while the classical world is recognised as having been\nall the time a dynamical pattern emerging from quantum mechanics, it\nturns out to be less classical than we might have expected. One\ninteresting example is the description of classically chaotic systems.\nA straightforward application of the techniques allowing one to derive\nNewtonian trajectories at the level of components has been employed by\nZurek and Paz (1994) to derive chaotic trajectories in\nquantum mechanics. The problem with the quantum description of chaotic\nbehaviour is that prima facie it should be impossible. Chaos\nis characterised roughly as extreme sensitivity in the behaviour of a\nsystem on its initial conditions, in the sense that the distance\nbetween the trajectories arising from different initial conditions\nincreases exponentially in time (see the entry on\n chaos).\n Since the Schr\u00f6dinger evolution is unitary, it\npreserves all scalar products and all distances between quantum state\nvectors. Thus, it would seem, close initial conditions lead to\ntrajectories that are uniformly close throughout all of time, and no\nchaotic behaviour is possible (\u2018problem of quantum\nchaos\u2019). The crucial point that enables Zurek and Paz\u2019s\nanalysis is that the relevant trajectories defined by decoherence are\nat the level of components of the state of the system.\nUnitarity is preserved because the vectors in the environment, to\nwhich these different components are coupled, are and remain\northogonal: how the components themselves more specifically evolve is\nimmaterial. Explicit modelling yields a picture of quantum chaos in\nwhich different trajectories branch (a feature absent from classical\nchaos, which is deterministic) and then indeed diverge exponentially.\n(As with the crossing of trajectories in de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory\nin\n Section 3.2,\n one has behaviour at the level of components that is qualitatively\ndifferent from the behaviour derived for wave functions of an isolated\nsystem.) The qualitative picture is the same as we mentioned above in\n Section 1.3,\n of classical trajectories that are kicked slightly off course\n(trajectories with slight kinks). In the case of classically chaotic\nsystems, however, this has a dramatic effect. This means that systems\nlike the weather turn out to be \u2018branching\u2019 all the time\ndue to decoherence interactions, so that what we usually think of as\nclassical unpredictability is in fact quantum indeterminism! (For an\nexcellent discussion, see Wallace 2012a, Chapters 3 and 10.) \n\nAnd as we have also mentioned, quantum phenomena themselves\nare a feature of the world that emerges through decoherence (Zeh\n2003a, p. 33; see also Bacciagaluppi 2002, Section 6.2): not only the\nstability of the outcomes of laboratory measurements, and thus\n\u2018quantum phenomena\u2019 in the specific sense of Bohr, but\nalso quantum jumps or the appearance of \\(\\alpha\\)-particle trajectories\nare a direct consequence of decoherence. The classical world yielded\nby decoherence is thus one (or one of many!) punctuated by quantum\nphenomena.\n4.2 Further applications\n\nFurther along these lines, Zeh (2003b) argues that decoherence can\nexplain the appearance of particle detections within quantum\nfield theory (see the entry on\n quantum field theory).\n Therefore, only fields need to be included in the fundamental\nconcepts, and \u2018particles\u2019 are a derived concept, unlike\nwhat might be suggested by the customary introduction of fields\nthrough a process of \u2018second quantisation\u2019. Another\napplication to quantum field theory is the suggestion that the\njustification for the (strict) superselection rule for charge in\nquantum field theory can also be phrased in terms of decoherence. As\npointed out by Giulini, Kiefer and Zeh (1995; see also Giulini et\nal. 1996, Section 6.4), an electric charge is surrounded by a\nCoulomb field (which electrostatically is infinitely extended; the\nargument can also be carried out using the retarded field, though).\nStates of different electric charge of a particle are thus coupled to\ndifferent, presumably orthogonal, states of its electric field. One\ncan consider the far-field as an effectively uncontrollable\nenvironment that decoheres the particle (and the near-field), so that\nsuperpositions of different charges are indeed always\n suppressed.[40]\n\nAnother claim about the significance of decoherence relates to time\nasymmetry (see e.g. the entries on\n time asymmetry in thermodynamics\n and\n philosophy of statistical mechanics).\n Insofar as apparent collapse (branching) is indeed a time-directed\nprocess, decoherence will have direct relevance to the emergence of\nthis \u2018quantum mechanical arrow of time\u2019. This is not a\nstraightforward issue, however, and questions familiar from the\nfoundations of statistical mechanics arise also in the context of\ndecoherence. Specific issues include the fact that models of\nenvironmental decoherence tend to assume very special (unentangled)\ninitial conditions, and the fact that the definition of the\ndecoherence functional in the histories approach is itself\nasymmetrical (although symmetric versions also exist). For a spectrum\nof discussions, see Hartle (1998, and references therein), Zeh (2001,\nChapter 4), and Bacciagaluppi (2002, Section 6.1; 2007). Whether\ndecoherence is connected to the other familiar arrows of time is a\nmore specific question. Indeed, should decoherence allow us to recover\nthe time-symmetric classical description of, say, particle\ntrajectories in a gas, or does it allow us to derive time-asymmetric\nthermodynamic behaviour directly, by-passing classical attempts at\nunderstanding it? Note that insofar as classical systems such as gases\nare believed to be chaotic, the origin of the probabilities in\nclassical statistical mechanics will arguably be quantum. For various\ndiscussions, see e.g. Zurek and Paz (1994), Hemmo and Shenker (2001),\nand Wallace (2012a, Chapter 9; and 2001, 2013a, 2013b in the\n Other Internet Resources).\n \n\nFinally, it has been suggested that decoherence should be a useful\ningredient in a theory of quantum gravity (see the entry on\n quantum gravity),\n as discussed e.g. by Kiefer (1994). First, because a suitable\ngeneralisation of decoherence theory to a full theory of quantum\ngravity should yield suppression of interference between different\nclassical spacetimes (see e.g. also Giulini et al. 1996,\nSection 4.2). Second, it is speculated that decoherence might solve\nthe so-called problem of time, which arises as a prominent\npuzzle in (the \u2018canonical\u2019 approach to) quantum gravity.\nThis is the problem that the candidate fundamental equation (in this\napproach) \u2013 the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation \u2013 is an\nanalogue of a time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and\ndoes not contain time at all, so that time needs somehow to emerge. In\nthe context of decoherence theory, one can for instance construct toy\nmodels in which the analogue of the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt wave function\ndecomposes into non-interfering components (for a suitable sub-system)\neach satisfying a time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\nso that decoherence appears in fact as the source of time. An\naccessible introduction to and philosophical discussion of such models\nis given by Ridderbos (1999), with references to the original papers.\nSee also the more recent model by Halliwell and Thorwart\n (2002).[41]",
