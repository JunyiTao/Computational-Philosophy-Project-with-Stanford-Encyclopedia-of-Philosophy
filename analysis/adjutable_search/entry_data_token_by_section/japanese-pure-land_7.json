    "main_text": "Contours of Pure Land Buddhist Thought || Merit Transference\n2.3 Merit Transference\n\nThere are several aspects of the bodhisattva\u2019s career of\nparticular note when approaching Pure Land Buddhist thought. First, an\nessential element of the bodhisattva path is the transference to other\nbeings of the merit that accrues from performance of praxis. All\nBuddhists have accepted that, by the principle of karmic causation,\ngood acts hold the power to counteract the effects of evil deeds and\nlead to better conditions in the next birth. In the earlier Buddhism,\nit was generally assumed that only one\u2019s own thoughts and acts\ncould exert their influence on one\u2019s future conditions, although\nthe evidence of inscriptions suggests that sharing merit with\none\u2019s parents or teacher was also recognized. In the Mahayana\ntradition, however, bodhisattvas perform good acts and practices for\nlong aeons and thus accumulate vast stores of merit, but their\npractice is invariably undertaken with the liberation of all beings\nforemost in their minds. Thus, their merit is always freely and\nselflessly given to beings in samsaric existence. This concept of\ngiving or transferring merit (Jp. ek\u014d) is a direct\nexpression of the nature of bodhisattvas, for they undertake their\npractice in nondichotomous wisdom.\n",
