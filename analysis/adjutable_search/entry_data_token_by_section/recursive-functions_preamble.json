    "main_text": "\n\nThe recursive functions are a class of functions on the\nnatural numbers studied in computability theory, a branch of\ncontemporary mathematical logic which was originally known as\nrecursive function theory. Such functions take their name\nfrom the process of recursion by which the value of a\nfunction is defined by the application of the same function applied to\nsmaller arguments.\n\nThis process may be illustrated by considering the familiar factorial\nfunction \\(x!\\)\u2014i.e., the function which returns the product \\(1\n\\times 2 \\times \\ldots \\times x\\) if \\(x > 0\\) and 1 otherwise. An\nalternative recursive definition of this function is as follows: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\label{defnfact}\n\\fact(0) & =  1 \\\\  \\nonumber\n\\fact(x+1) & =  (x+1) \\times \\fact(x) \\end{align}\\]\n\n\nSuch a definition might at first appear circular in virtue of the fact\nthat the value of \\(\\fact(x)\\) on the left hand side is defined in\nterms the same function on the righthand side. However a\ncharacteristic feature of recursive definitions is that they allow for\nthe values of functions which they describe to be calculated by\nsuccessively \u201cunwinding\u201d the clause for \\(x > 0\\) until\nthe clause for \\(x = 0\\) (the so-called base case) is\nreached. For instance the value of \\(fact(4)\\) may be calculated using\nthe preceding definition as follows: \n\\[\\begin{align} \\label{factcalc}\n\\fact(4) &= 4 \\times \\fact(3) \\\\\n& = 4 \\times (3 \\times \\fact(2))  \\nonumber \\\\\n& = 4 \\times (3 \\times (2 \\times \\fact(1)))  \\nonumber \\\\\n &=4 \\times (3 \\times (2 \\times 1 \\times (\\fact(0))))  \\nonumber \\\\\n& = 4 \\times (3 \\times (2 \\times (1 \\times 1)))  \\nonumber \\\\\n& = 24  \\nonumber \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nUnderstood in this way, the defining equations (\\ref{defnfact})\nprovide an algorithm for computing \\(\\fact(x)\\)\u2014i.e. an\neffective procedure for calculating its values which can be carried\nout by a human or mechanical computing device within a finite number\nof steps. It is for this reason that a class of recursive definitions\nsimilar to that exemplified by (\\ref{defnfact})\u2014 i.e. the\ngeneral recursive functions\u2014were first employed as the\nmathematical model of computation on which recursive function theory\nwas originally founded.\n\nSection 1 of this entry provides an overview of the foundational\ndevelopments in logic and mathematics which led to the founding of\nrecursive function theory in the 1930s. Section 2 surveys different\nforms of recursive definitions, inclusive of the primitive\nand partial recursive functions which are most central to the\nclassical development of this subject. Section 3 provides an overview\nof computability theory, inclusive of the so-called Recursion\nTheorem (Section 3.4)\u2014a result which highlights the\ncentrality of recursion to computation in general as well as its\nrelationship to self-reference. Subsequent updates to this entry will\nprovide an overview of subrecursive hierarchies employed in proof\ntheory and computer science as well as a more comprehensive treatment\nof contemporary computability theory. \n",
