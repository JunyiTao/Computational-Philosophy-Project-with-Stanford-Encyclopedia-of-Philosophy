    "main_text": "Language and Mind\n3. Language and Mind\n\nSome scholars have suggested that Leibniz should be regarded as one of\nthe first thinkers to envision something like the idea of artificial\nintelligence (cf. Churchland 1984; Pratt 1987). Whether or not he\nshould be regarded as such, it is clear that Leibniz, like\ncontemporary cognitive scientists, saw an intimate connection between\nthe form and content of language, and the operations of the mind.\nIndeed, according to his own testimony in the New Essays, he\n\u201creally believe[s] that languages are the best mirror of the\nhuman mind, and that a precise analysis of the signification of words\nwould tell us more than anything else about the operations of the\nunderstanding\u201d (bk.III, ch.7, sec.6 (RB, 333)). This view of\nLeibniz\u2019s led him to formulate a plan for a \u201cuniversal\nlanguage,\u201d an artificial language composed of symbols, which\nwould stand for concepts or ideas, and logical rules for their valid\nmanipulation. He believed that such a language would perfectly mirror\nthe processes of intelligible human reasoning. It is this plan that\nhas led some to believe that Leibniz came close to anticipating\nartificial intelligence. At any rate, Leibniz\u2019s writings about\nthis project (which, it should be noted, he never got the chance to\nactualize) reveal significant insights into his understanding of the\nnature of human reasoning. This understanding, it turns out, is not\nthat different from contemporary conceptions of the mind, as many of\nhis discussions bear considerable relevance to discussions in the\ncognitive sciences.\n\nAccording to Leibniz, natural language, despite its powerful resources\nfor communication, often makes reasoning obscure since it is an\nimperfect mirror of intelligible thoughts. As a result, it is often\ndifficult to reason with the apparatus of natural language,\n\u201csince it is full of innumerable equivocations\u201d (On\nthe Universal Science: Characteristic (undated); G VII, 205/S\n18). Perhaps this is because of his view that the terms of natural\nlanguage stand for complex, or derivative, concepts\u2014concepts\nwhich are composed of, and reducible to, simpler concepts. With this\n\u201ccombinatorial\u201d view of concepts in hand, Leibniz notices\n\u201cthat all human ideas can be resolved into a few as their\nprimitives\u201d (On the Universal Science: Characteristic;\nG VII, 205/S 18). We could then assign symbols, or\n\u201ccharacters,\u201d to these primitive concepts from which we\ncould form characters for derivative concepts by means of combinations\nof the symbols. As a result, Leibniz tells us, \u201cit would be\npossible to find correct definitions and values and, hence, also the\nproperties which are demonstrably implied in the definitions\u201d\n(On the Universal Science: Characteristic; G VII, 205/S 19).\nThe totality of these symbols would form a \u201cuniversal\ncharacteristic,\u201d an ideal language in which all human concepts\nwould be perfectly represented, and their constitutive nature\nperfectly transparent. Now it is true that Leibniz eventually came to\ndoubt \u201cwhether any concept of this [primitive] kind appears\ndistinctly to men, namely, in such a way that they know they have\nit\u201d (An Introduction to a Secret Encyclopedia (1679?);\nC 513/MP 7). But it is also clear that he did not see this skepticism\nconcerning our ability to reach the primitive concepts as much of a\nbarrier to the project of a universal language. He writes in The\nArt of Discovery (1685) that \u201cthere are certain primitive\nterms which can be posited, if not absolutely, at least relatively to\nus\u201d (C 176/W 51). The suggestion seems to be that even if we\ncannot provide a catalog of absolutely primitive concepts, we can\nnevertheless construct a characteristic based on concepts which cannot\nbe further resolved by humans.\n\nIn addition to the resolution of concepts, and their symbolic\nassignments, Leibniz envisages the formulation of logical rules for\nthe universal characteristic. He claims that \u201cit is plain that\nmen make use in reasoning of several axioms which are not yet quite\ncertain\u201d (The Method of Certitude and the Art of\nDiscovery (undated); G VII, 183/W 49). Yet with the explicit\nformulation of these rules for the logical manipulation of the\nsymbols\u2014rules which humans use in reasoning\u2014we would be in\npossession of a universal language which would mirror the relations\nbetween the concepts used in human reasoning. Indeed, the universal\ncharacteristic was intended by Leibniz as an instrument for the\neffective calculation of truths. Like formal logic systems, it would\nbe a language capable of representing valid reasoning patterns by\nmeans of the use of symbols. Unlike formal logic systems, however, the\nuniversal language would also express the content of human reasoning\nin addition to its formal structure. In Leibniz\u2019s mind,\n\u201cthis language will be the greatest instrument of reason,\u201d\nfor \u201cwhen there are disputes among persons, we can simply say:\nLet us calculate, without further ado, and see who is right\u201d\n(The Art of Discovery (1685); C 176/W 51).\n\nJudging from Leibniz\u2019s plans for a universal language, it is\nclear that Leibniz had a specific view about the nature of human\ncognitive processes, particularly about the nature of human reasoning.\nAccording to this view, cognition is essentially symbolic: it takes\nplace in a system of representations which possesses language-like\nstructure. Indeed, it was Leibniz\u2019s view that \u201call human\nreasoning uses certain signs or characters,\u201d (On the\nUniversal Science: Characteristic; G VII, 204/S 17) and \u201cif\nthere were no characters, we could neither think of anything\ndistinctly nor reason about it\u201d (Dialogue (1677); G\nVII, 191/A&G 271)). Add to this conception Leibniz\u2019s view\nthat human cognitive processes follow determinable axioms of logic,\nand the picture that emerges is one according to which the mind\noperates, at least when it comes to intelligible reasoning, by\nfollowing implicit algorithmic procedures. Regardless of whether or\nnot Leibniz should be seen as the grandfather of artificial\nintelligence, he did conceive of human cognition in essentially\ncomputational terms. In fact, as early as 1666, remarking favorably on\nHobbes\u2019 writings, Leibniz wrote: \u201cThomas Hobbes,\neverywhere a profound examiner of principles, rightly stated that\neverything done by our mind is a computation\u201d (On\nthe Art of Combinations (1666); G IV, 64/P 3).\n",
