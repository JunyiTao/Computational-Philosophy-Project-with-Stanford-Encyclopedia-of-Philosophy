    "main_text": "Art, Religion and Philosophy in Hegel\u2019s System\n3. Art, Religion and Philosophy in Hegel\u2019s System\n\n\nHegel\u2019s philosophy of art forms part of his overall philosophical\nsystem. In order to understand his philosophy of art, therefore, one\nmust understand the main claims of his philosophy as a whole. Hegel\nargues in his speculative logic that being is to be\nunderstood as self-determining reason or \u201cIdea\u201d\n(Idee). In the philosophy of nature, however, he goes on to\nshow that logic tells only half the story: for such reason is not\nsomething abstract\u2014is not a disembodied logos\u2014but\ntakes the form of rationally organized matter. What there is,\naccording to Hegel, is thus not just pure reason but physical,\nchemical and living matter that obeys rational principles.\n\n\nLife is more explicitly rational than mere physical matter because it\nis more explicitly self-determining. Life itself becomes more\nexplicitly rational and self-determining when it becomes conscious and\nself-conscious\u2014that is, life that can imagine, use language,\nthink and exercise freedom. Such self-conscious life Hegel calls\n\u201cspirit\u201d (Geist). Reason, or the Idea, comes to\nbe fully self-determining and rational, therefore, when it takes the\nform of self-conscious spirit. This occurs, in Hegel\u2019s view, with the\nemergence of human existence. Human beings, for Hegel, are\nthus not just accidents of nature; they are reason itself\u2014the\nreason inherent in nature\u2014that has come to life and come to\nconsciousness of itself. Beyond human beings (or other finite rational\nbeings that might exist on other planets), there is no self-conscious\nreason in Hegel\u2019s universe.\n\n\nIn his philosophy of objective spirit Hegel analyses the institutional\nstructures that are required if spirit\u2014that is,\nhumanity\u2014is to be properly free and self-determining. These\ninclude the institutions of right, the family, civil society and the\nstate. In the philosophy of absolute spirit Hegel then analyses the\ndifferent ways in which spirit articulates its ultimate,\n\u201cabsolute\u201d understanding of itself. The highest, most\ndeveloped and most adequate understanding of spirit is attained by\nphilosophy (the bare bones of whose understanding of the world have\njust been sketched). Philosophy provides an explicitly\nrational, conceptual understanding of the nature of reason or\nthe Idea. It explains precisely why reason must take the form\nof space, time, matter, life and self-conscious spirit.\n\n\nIn religion\u2014above all in Christianity\u2014spirit gives\nexpression to the same understanding of reason and of itself as\nphilosophy. In religion, however, the process whereby the Idea becomes\nself-conscious spirit is represented\u2014in images and\nmetaphors\u2014as the process whereby \u201cGod\u201d becomes the\n\u201cHoly Spirit\u201d dwelling in humanity. Furthermore, this\nprocess is one in which we put our faith and trust:\nit is the object of feeling and belief, rather than conceptual\nunderstanding.\n\n\nIn Hegel\u2019s view, philosophy and religion\u2014which is to say,\nHegel\u2019s own speculative philosophy and Christianity\u2014both\nunderstand the same truth. Religion, however, believes in a\nrepresentation of the truth, whereas philosophy understands that truth\nwith complete conceptual clarity. It may seem strange that we would\nneed religion, if we have philosophy: surely the latter makes the\nformer redundant. For Hegel, however, humanity cannot live by concepts\nalone, but also needs to picture, imagine, and have faith in the\ntruth.  Indeed, Hegel claims that it is in religion above all\nthat \u201ca nation defines what it considers to be true\u201d\n(Lectures on the Philosophy of World History, 105).\n\n\nArt, for Hegel, also gives expression to spirit\u2019s understanding of\nitself. It differs from philosophy and religion, however, by\nexpressing spirit\u2019s self-understanding not in pure concepts, or in the\nimages of faith, but in and through objects that have been\nspecifically made for this purpose by human beings. Such\nobjects\u2014conjured out of stone, wood, color, sound or\nwords\u2014render the freedom of spirit visible or audible to an\naudience.  In Hegel\u2019s view, this sensuous expression of free\nspirit constitutes beauty. The purpose of art, for Hegel, is\nthus the creation of beautiful objects in which the true character of\nfreedom is given sensuous expression.\n\n\nThe principal aim of art is not, therefore, to imitate nature, to\ndecorate our surroundings, to prompt us to engage in moral or\npolitical action, or to shock us out of our complacency. It is to\nallow us to contemplate and enjoy created images of our own spiritual\nfreedom\u2014images that are beautiful precisely because\nthey give expression to our freedom. Art\u2019s purpose, in other words, is\nto enable us to bring to mind the truth about ourselves, and so to\nbecome aware of who we truly are. Art is there not just for art\u2019s\nsake, but for beauty\u2019s sake, that is, for the sake of a distinctively\nsensuous form of human self-expression and self-understanding.\n",
