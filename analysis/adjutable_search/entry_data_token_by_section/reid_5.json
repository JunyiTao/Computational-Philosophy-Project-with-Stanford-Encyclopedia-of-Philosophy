    "main_text": "Conception || Abstraction, Universals and General Conceptions\n2.3 Abstraction, Universals and General Conceptions\n\n\nReid is a nominalist about universals, which means that Reid does not\nbelieve that universals exist independently of the set of individual\nthings that instantiate the shared property. (A universal is a\nproperty shared by many individuals, each of which instantiates the\nuniversal. In addition to opposing arguments for universals, he also\nopposes the form of nominalism advocated by Berkeley and Hume. Reid\nconcludes that universals are general terms, not abstract or general\nideas.\n\n\nAs usual, Reid builds his theory by learning from mistakes of earlier\ntheories. Medieval philosophers argued, by Reid's account, that a\nuniversal exists independently of individual things. Some of these\nphilosophers argued that the independent existence of a universal was\nexistence as a form, a venerable philosophical\nterm. Addressing this, Reid says it is impossible that \u201ca\ntriangle should really exist which has no precise proportion of sides\nand angles\u201d and, generally, it is \u201cimpossible that any\nbeing should exist which is not an individual being\u201d (EIP 5.6,\n396). The principal philosophical error that led to the reification of\nuniversal properties as independent existents is the conflation of the\nobjects of conception with the objects of perception (EIP 4.1,\n302\u20133). The metaphysics required to undergird the existence of\nuniversals is anathema to Reid's commonsense commitments and his\nempirical method.\n\n\nNext Reid considers a theory he associates with Locke, namely that\nuniversals do not exist as metaphysical forms but rather universals\nare abstract ideas. Abstract ideas arise through a process in which\nfacts about time and space are stripped away from particular members\nof a class of thing leaving the abstract idea that represents common\ncharacteristics (EIP 3.2). Reid argues that there can be no such\nabstract ideas and that abstract ideas cannot represent members of a\nclass of particulars (EIP 5.6, 391\u20133). Reid recognizes his great debt\nto Berkeley's criticisms of Lockean abstract ideas in these\nconnections.\n\n\nIn effect, Reid arrives at his own theory by endorsing Berkeley's\nnominalism and attempting to remove from it reference to ideas. Reid\nreplaces talk of abstract ideas with the term \u2018general conception.\u2019 As\nto the ontology of general conceptions, Reid says that human minds\ncreate them, not nature; this reconfirms Reid's nominalism about kind\nterms. General terms are the linguistic manifestation of general\nconceptions. General terms are general due to their referents, but\nthey are particular token conceptions of individuals (EIP 5.2,\n360). General terms refer to species or to attributes. When we\nconceive of general terms like \u2018lion\u2019 or \u2018felony\u2019 or \u2018unicorn\u2019,\n\u201cthe meaning of the word is the thing conceived\u201d (EIP 5.2,\n364). The term \u2018lion\u2019 does not resemble what it is about; it\nrepresents the class of lions by convention.\n\n\nThis leads to Reid's explanation of how general conceptions are\nformed. Reid says this typically happens via induction through\ntestimony and not via definitions (EIP 5.2, 363). For Reid, forming\ngeneral conceptions is typically a public process and a product of\nsocial practices, in contrast to Locke, Berkeley and Hume, for whom\nforming abstract ideas is typically a private process. (Though we do\nnot enter into discussion of the role of testimony and social\nknowledge anywhere in this entry, it is especially prominent in Reid.)\nHowever, one may also form a general conception on one's own. In this\ncase, in the first stage one analyses a subject into its attributes\nand names them, which Reid compares to a chemist analyzing a compound\n(EIP 5.3, 370). Next one observes that similar token attributes are\npossessed by many objects. Third is \u201ccombining into one hole a\ncertain number of those attributes...and giving a name to that\ncombination\u201d (EIP 5.3, 365). The name that results may be the\nsame as the name for a particular attribute, e.g. \u2018whiteness,\u2019 but\nused as a general term, \u2018whiteness\u2019 \u201cimplies no existence, but\nmay be predicated of everything that is white, and in the same\nsense\u201d (EIP 5.3, 367). This way of putting the point\u2014that\nthe general term whiteness may be predicated of everything that is\nwhite\u2014has inspired a dispositional interpretation of Reidian\ngeneral conceptions (Castagnetto 1992). Reid's writing on general\nconceptions and abstraction are areas\u2014like the next topic,\nconception of non-existent objects\u2014that have not been given much\nattention.\n",
