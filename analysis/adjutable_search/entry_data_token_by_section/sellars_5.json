    "main_text": "Philosophy of Mind\n5. Philosophy of Mind\nSellars\u2019s philosophy of mind is deeply Kantian in the sense\nthat he draws a sharp distinction between thought and sense.  The intentionality-body problem requires a different solution from the sensorium-body\nproblem.  His philosophy of mind\nabandons many of the assumptions taken for granted by the Cartesian\ntradition (e.g., the transparent or self-intimating nature of the\nmental), moving towards a naturalism that respects the normative\ndimension of mind.  His key idea is that psychological concepts are like\ntheoretical concepts in the sciences. Mentalistic concepts\nare thus as compatible with naturalism as any well-grounded scientific\nconcept.\nSellars defends these claims in his classic article, EPM.  The\n\u201cRylean myth\u201d narrated in parts 12\u201316 of EPM is a\nthought experiment aimed to convince us that the Cartesian story is\nnot the only possible story about our knowledge of the mental.  The thought experiment\nhypothesizes a community of proto-humans who lack concepts of inner\npsychological states, although they possess a complex language for\ndescribing and explaining objects and events in the world.  Sellars\ncalls them \u2018Ryleans\u2019 in honor of Gilbert Ryle, the Oxford\nphilosopher whose book, The Concept of Mind, argues eloquently\nfor a version of logical behaviorism.  This community possesses a\nbehaviorist\u2019s ability to explain human behavior as well as\nmetalinguistic abilities to describe and prescribe linguistic\nbehavior.  Thus, the community has semantic concepts at its disposal.\nSellars claims that such a community can reasonably increase its\nexplanatory resources by postulating unobservable states internal to\neach person that modulate that person\u2019s responses to the world.\nMoreover, there is motive to postulate two different kinds of internal\nstates: one kind\u2014thoughts\u2014has properties modeled on the\nsemantic properties of overt linguistic events, while the\nother\u2014sense impressions\u2014has properties modeled on the\nproperties of perceptible objects.  Thoughts are postulated to explain\nhow the members of the community can engage in complex patterns of\nreasonable behavior even when silent.  Sense impressions are\npostulated to explain why members of the community acquire conceptual representations of objects as before them, even, at times, when such objects are not present.  If Sellars\u2019s story\nis coherent, then the traditional view that our concepts and knowledge\nof the mental are simply given is not compulsory, and a\nnaturalistic treatment of the mental is potentially viable.\n",
