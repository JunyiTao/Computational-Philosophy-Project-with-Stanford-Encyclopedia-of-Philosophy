    "main_text": "Respect and Dignity\n6. Respect and Dignity\n\nThe fight with Covey has inspired several philosophical\ninterpretations of Douglass\u2019s intentions and the meaning of his\nstruggle. It is commonly read as an exemplar of the conception of the\nstate of war within liberal political theory (Davis 1971) and the\ninterpersonal, or generally relational, dynamics of respect and\n recognition.[17]\n In particular, Bernard Boxill (1997 and 1998) developed an\nexceptionally influential deontological account of Douglass\u2019s\nfight as emblematic of the individual sense of self-respect of oneself\nas a moral\n being.[18]\n That self-recognition comes with the obligation to defend one\u2019s\nself-respect and to expect respect from others, which implies that\nothers should recognize one\u2019s inherent dignity. For\nDouglass, that fight was a parable\u2014like Jacob\u2019s wrestling\nwith an angel (Genesis 32:24\u201332\n [KJV]),[19]\n except in this case, the antagonist was more demonic than\nangelic\u2014about the American and black American fight against\nslavery and racism.\n\nWhat is more, Douglass\u2019s evocation of dignity in his narrative\nof the fight is intellectually and emotionally stunning. \u201cA man,\nwithout force\u201d, he intensely asserted, \u201cis without the\nessential dignity of humanity\u201d. He adds to that the claim\nthat\n\n\n[h]uman nature is so constituted, that it cannot honor a\nhelpless man, although it can pity him; and even this it\ncannot do long, if the signs of power do not arise. (FDAB, 286,\noriginal emphases)\n\n\nThe moral weightiness of the idea of dignity and his use of it invites\nus to consider whether it plays a special role in his thought and its\nrelation to his frequently repeated arguments and assertions of the\nhumanity and equal moral personhood of black people. Most of his\nmentions of dignity in his speeches and writings primarily refer to it\nas an ordinary sense of respectful comportment and propriety.\nNonetheless, everyday assertions of dignity, even passive ones, have\nmorally serious implications for individuals, groups, and societies\nunder conditions of absolute domination, such as faced by black\nAmericans during slavery and Jim Crow segregation. Assertions of\neveryday dignity could often be met with severe and sometimes violent\nconsequences under those conditions\u2014a fact that Douglass\nhighlighted and condemned throughout his life. When Douglass referred\nto moral personhood as such (the essential moral worth of persons), he\ntypically used the ideas of \u201cequality\u201d, \u201cperfect\nhuman equality\u201d, \u201cmanhood\u201d,\n\u201cbrotherhood\u201d, and \u201cuniversal human\nbrotherhood\u201d.\n\nThere are, however, moments, as noted in the passage above from My\nBondage and My Freedom, where his usage of \u201cdignity\u201d\nexplicitly points to the idea of equal moral personhood.\n\nThe same is true in an editorial he wrote in 1850 responding to\nslander, verbal assaults, and a physical one:\n\n\nMy crime is, that I have assumed to be a man, entitled to all the\nrights, privileges and dignity, which belong to human\nnature\u2014that color is no crime, and that all men are\nbrother. I have acted on this presumption. The very\n\u201chead and front of my offending hath this extent\u2014no\nmore\u201d. I have not merely talked of human brotherhood and\nhuman equality, but have reduced that talk to practice. This I\nhave done in broad open day, scorning concealment. I have walked\nthrough the streets of New York, in company with white persons, not as\na menial, but as an equal. (1850 [FDSW: 157]; my emphases)\n\n\nAs discussed in the previous sections on slavery, natural law,\nliberty, the U.S. Constitution, and self-defense, Douglass vigorously\ndefended equal personhood and thus the moral equality of black people.\nOn that basis, he condemned slavery as an affront to natural law,\nChristianity, and republicanism. Therefore, regardless of the\nfrequency he referred to the term \u201cdignity\u201d, he does get\nat the idea, and it does play a central role (along with and\ndefined through the constellation of other ideas he drew on)\nin his political philosophical thought. Perhaps then, a basic account\nof dignity, as indicative of individual moral worth, is all that is\nneeded to understand Douglass\u2019s view. Stopping with that,\nhowever, would impart a sense of passivity to it. Douglass\u2019s\nview was not simply static.\n\nDignity, for Douglass, is a natural and innate thing, bequeathed to\nall humans as humans. It is static or changeless in that limited\nsense. At the same time, Douglass suggests that willful action,\nepitomized by self-defense, was a condition of what was otherwise an\ninherent and essential quality of being a human person. It is\nsomething to be\n practiced.[20]\n But if dignity is innate and inherent, why must an individual\npractice it for it to be said that they have it? If it is an essential\nquality, then its practice or expression cannot be a condition of its\npossession. Douglass is not equivocating on this point. An\nindividual\u2019s equal moral status comes with the obligation to\ninhabit, abide by, and defend that\n status.[21]\n This is how we should understand Douglass\u2019s view of dignity as\nmodeled by his open-air rejection of servility and assertion of\nequality.\n\nAll the same, Douglass does not, nor could he, consistently hold that\nevery enslaved black person needed to have an equivalent \u201cfight\nwith Covey\u201d moment and assertion of \u201cmanhood\u201d to\nsecure their dignity and natural right to be treated as a moral equal.\nDirectly related to this concern is the continuing discussion of\nwhether the depiction of the fight with Covey and its meaning and\nvalue promote a masculinist vision of anti-slavery resistance,\nliberty, and autonomy (Wallace 2009 and 2014; Alfaro 2018). Douglass\ndid not think that the attitudes and actions of the enslaved\nconditioned the immorality of slavery and the imperative of\nemancipation, so what counts as resistance to indignities of injustice\nrequires careful and charitable consideration that is attentive to the\nconstraints of individual circumstances and social conditions.\n\nThe bravado in Douglass\u2019s wonderful affront to racism aside, his\nvision of self-respect, dignity, and the obligation to defend oneself\nand one\u2019s dignity is central to his legacy. It plays a vital\nrole in the history of African American political theory, and for that\nreason, given this nation\u2019s history, it is a valuable\ncontribution to American political philosophy about respect, dignity,\nand personhood. Its implications are profound, as can be seen in his\nview of universal human brotherhood.\n",
