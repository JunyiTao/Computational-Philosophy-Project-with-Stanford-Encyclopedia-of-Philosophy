    "main_text": "Theories of Unity\n7. Theories of Unity\n\nIn the literature, there is quite a range of theoretical claims about\nunified consciousness. We have looked at some of them. The first group\nconcerned diverging models: the subsumption, co-consciousness, single\nphenomenal content, and joint consciousness models and related\ntaxonomies. Then we looked at the unity thesis, claims about limits to\nand disorders of unified consciousness, claims about unity over time,\nand claims that there need not be a whole number of centres of\nconsciousness and that partial unity is possible. In\n Section 2,\n we said that we\u2019d return to the issue of whether unified\nexperiences has or does not have experiential parts (EP vs. NEP), the\nissue that underlays subsumption. EP and NEP are the topics of\nSections\n 7.1\n and\n 7.2.\n Near the end of\n Section 4,\n we said that we would return to the claim that unified consciousness\nrequires links among conscious contents. We will take up this issues\nin\n Section 7.3.\n Finally for this Section, we will examine a claim that we have not\ndiscussed so far, what is usually called the co-ownership thesis\n (Section 7.4)\n \n",
