    "main_text": "The Concept of Respect\n1. The Concept of Respect\n\nPhilosophers have approached the concept of respect with a variety of\nquestions. (1) One set concerns the nature of respect, including (a)\nWhat sort of thing is respect? Philosophers have variously identified\nit as a mode of behavior, a form of treatment, a kind of valuing, a\ntype of attention, a motive, an attitude, a feeling, a tribute, a\nprinciple, a duty, an entitlement, a moral virtue, an epistemic\nvirtue: are any of these categories more central than others? (b) Are\nthere different kinds of respect? If so, is any more basic than\nothers? (c) Are there different levels or degrees of respect? (d) What\nare the distinctive elements of respect, or a specific kind of\nrespect? What beliefs, attitudes, emotions, and motives does (a\nspecific kind of) respect involve, and what ways of acting and\nforbearing to act express or constitute or are regulated by it? (e) To\nwhat other attitudes, actions, valuings, duties, etc., is respect (or\na specific kind) similar, and with what does it contrast? In\nparticular, how is respect similar to, different from, or connected\nwith esteem, honor, love, awe, reverence, recognition, toleration,\ndignity, contempt, indifference, discounting, denigration, and so\non? (2) A second set of questions concerns objects of respect,\nincluding (a)What sorts of things can be reasonably be said to warrant\nrespect? (b) What are the bases or grounds for respect, i.e., the\nfeatures of or facts about objects in virtue of which it is reasonable\nand perhaps obligatory to respect them? (c) Must every appropriate\nobject always be respected? Can respect be forfeited, can lost respect\nbe regained? (3) A third set of questions focuses on moral dimensions\nof respect, including (a) Are there moral requirements to respect\ncertain types of objects, and, if so, what are the scope and grounds\nof such requirements? (b) Why is respect morally important? What, if\nanything, does it add to morality over and above the conduct,\nattitudes, and character traits required or encouraged by various\nmoral principles or virtues? (c) What does respect entail morally for\nhow we should treat one another in everyday interactions, for issues\nin specific contexts such as health care and the workplace, and for\nfraught issues such as abortion, racial and gender justice, and global\ninequality?\n",
