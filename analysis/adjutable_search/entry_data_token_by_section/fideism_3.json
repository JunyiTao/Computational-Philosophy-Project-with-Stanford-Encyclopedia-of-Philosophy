    "main_text": "A Brief History of \u201cFideism\u201d || The Usual Suspects\n2.2 The Usual Suspects\n\nToday the term \u201cfideism\u201d is perhaps most commonly\nassociated with four philosophers: Pascal, Kierkegaard, James, and\nWittgenstein. In order to assess how well the label fits, it will be\nhelpful to discuss their respective views in slightly more detail.\nNote, however, that each is also treated at greater length elsewhere\nin this encyclopedia.\n2.2.1 Pascal\n\nWhereas Montaigne\u2019s followers, though significant theological\nfigures in their day, \u201cshowed no particular fervor in their\nreligious views\u201d and practiced a \u201ctepid, if sincere\u201d\nform of Catholicism (Popkin 1992, 124), the same could not be said of\nBlaise Pascal (1623\u20131662), whose Pens\u00e9es attest\nto a more \u201cevangelical\u201d brand of Pyrrhonian piety.\nFollowing a transformative mystical experience in 1654, Pascal spent\nmuch of the remainder of his life in the monasteries of Port-Royal,\nworking out a defense of his faith.\n\nCentral to this defense, seemingly paradoxically, is the conviction\nthat belief in God cannot be defended by means of the usual apologetic\narguments. The very nature of what is believed in \u2013 namely, an\n\u201cinfinitely incomprehensible\u201d being \u2013 is such as to\nrender these arguments necessarily inadequate.\n\nWho then will blame Christians for not being able to give reasons for\ntheir beliefs, since they profess belief in a religion which they\ncannot explain? They declare, when they expound it to the world, that\nit is foolishness, stultitiam; and then you complain because\nthey do not prove it! If they proved it, they would not keep their\nword; it is through their lack of proofs that they show they are not\nlacking in sense (201).\n\n\nThe most the philosophical arguments could prove, Pascal suggests, is\nthe \u201cgod of the philosophers\u201d \u2013 not the \u201cGod of\nAbraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\u201d\n\nPascal insists that faith can nevertheless be rational in the absence\nof proof \u2013 i.e., that it is rational in a prudential rather than\nan epistemic sense. It is here that he introduces his celebrated\n\u201cWager\u201d arguments. Pascal\u2019s first move in the\nargument is a skeptical one. He argues that although God either exists\nor does not exist, we cannot settle the issue on the basis of reason\nalone. The proofs of God\u2019s existence are not conclusive, but\nneither are the proofs of God\u2019s non-existence. \u201cReason can\ndetermine nothing\u201d (201).\n\nGranting that reason is indeed neutral with respect to the question of\nwhether or not God exists, it might at first be thought that the\nsafest and most rational course of action would be to refuse to take a\nstand one way or the other \u2013 to remain agnostic about the\nexistence of God. However, Pascal argues that this is not possible:\nnot choosing to believe is equivalent to choosing\nnot to believe. If you do not choose for God, you in\neffect choose against God. But on what basis, then, should\none decide?\n\nThe solution, Pascal argues, is to weigh the potential rewards of\nbelieving in God against the potential rewards of failing to believe\nin God \u2013 i.e., to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the relative\nmerits of \u201cwagering\u201d for or against God\u2019s existence.\nThe options, as Pascal construes them, can be outlined in the form of\na table:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nGod exists\nGod does not exist \n\n\n\nBelieve\nInfinite Gain\nNo (or Finite) Loss/Finite Gain \n\nDisbelieve\nInfinite Loss\nFinite Gain \n\n\n\nThese options can be assessed in terms of what is known within\ncontemporary decision theory as the Expected Value Principle (EVP).\nThe EVP states that when one is faced with a choice among competing\ncourses of action, one should choose whichever has the highest\n\u201cexpected value.\u201d Expected value can be calculated by (a)\nmultiplying the probability of a successful outcome by the value of\nthat outcome; (b) multiplying the probability of an unsuccessful\noutcome by the cost of that outcome; and (c) taking the sum of the\nresults of (a) and (b). In light of the EVP it can be rational to\ngamble on an improbable outcome given a sufficiently high potential\npayoff.\n\nOf course, in the case of God, it is hard to determine what the\nchances of a successful outcome might be: we cannot justifiably\nassume, for example, that the likelihood of God existing is equal to\nthe likelihood of God not existing. But that is irrelevant, Pascal\nargues, because the payoff if God exists is an infinite\npayoff. Thus, the potential for infinite gain makes it rational to bet\nthat God exists, however slim the actual chances of this might be: as\nlong as one is willing to grant that there is \u201cone chance of\nwinning against a finite number of chances of losing,\u201d it is a\nbetter deal to bet on God (202\u2013203).\n\nAlthough Pascal\u2019s argument seems to be valid \u2013 that is, its\nconclusion follows logically from its premises \u2013 Pascal\u2019s\ncritics have raised a number of other objections to it. In the first\nplace, it has been said that any argument which seeks to justify faith\nentirely in such crassly prudential terms is necessarily impious or\nimproper. To be sure, it is hard to avoid feeling, as William James\nput it, \u201cthat when religious faith expresses itself thus, in the\nlanguage of the gaming-table, it is put to its last trumps\u201d (6).\nJames went on to remark that \u201cif we were ourselves in the place\nof the Deity, we should probably take particular pleasure in cutting\noff believers of this pattern from their infinite reward\u201d (6).\nIn fairness, however, it should be noted that Pascal\u2019s use of\nthe \u201cWager\u201d is merely instrumental. It is intended simply\nas a first step toward, and not as a substitute for, genuine religious\nfaith. Furthermore, the claim that it is somehow improper to base such\na decision on prudential reasons seems to presuppose precisely what\nPascal denies \u2013 namely, that there are epistemic reasons on which\none\u2019s decision might more appropriately be made to rest. It is\nimportant to appreciate that Pascal is not urging his readers to\nbelieve something they otherwise have reason to doubt. As he puts it,\n\u201cYour reason is not more deeply wounded by choosing one rather\nthan the other because it is bound to choose\u201d (202).\n\nBut can one choose to believe for purely instrumental reasons? A\nsecond worry is that Pascal\u2019s argument seems to presuppose a\nproblematic version of doxastic voluntarism, the view that\nbelieving is subject to the will. Believing in God, unlike raising\none\u2019s arm, it might be objected, is not open to direct voluntary\ncontrol. However, Pascal anticipates this objection, arguing that a\nwould-be believer should begin by imitating the motions of a believer.\nBy, for instance, attending Mass and taking holy water, a would-be\nbeliever may succeed in cultivating genuine belief. This argument\nsuggests that Pascal is committed to the less controversial thesis of\nindirect doxastic voluntarism \u2013 the view that a person\ncan indirectly control his or her beliefs by directly controlling his\nor her epistemic situation. Still, the prospect of voluntarily\ninducing belief for purely non-epistemic reasons has struck many\ncommentators as manipulative and self-deceptive.\n\nA third problem is that Pascal\u2019s argument depends upon an overly\nnarrow construal of one\u2019s religious options. It is of course the\ncase, as Pascal claims, that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob\neither exists or does not exist, but the same is true of a seemingly\nendless number of other possible deities. If we assume the possibility\nof infinite reward in each case, it is no longer clear that\nCatholicism is any more rational than its religious alternatives. In\nreply, Jeff Jordan recently has argued that the \u201cWager\u201d\ncan be reconfigured to show, not that one religion is more rational\nthan another, but simply that atheism and agnosticism are\nirrational.\n\nJordan follows Pascal in treating religious belief as a necessary\nprerequisite for eternal happiness. However, some critics have\nquestioned this assumption. How do we know \u2013 it might be\nasked \u2013 that if he or she exists, God would make salvation\ncontingent on correct belief? Pascal seems to vacillate between a\nprofessed ignorance of God\u2019s nature and some rather doctrinaire\nassumptions about it. Indeed, if one grants that there is even a small\nchance of achieving infinite bliss by pursuing a\nnon-religious path, then the EVP suggests that such a path\nwould be just as rational in light of its expected value.\n\nAlthough Pascal\u2019s \u201cWager\u201d is widely regarded as\nhaving been discredited, within the past few years there has been a\nrevival of philosophical interest in the argument, and some\ncontemporary philosophers have attempted to rehabilitate a version of\nit. In Rationality and Religious Theism, for instance, Joshua\nL. Golding adopts a broadly Pascalian strategy in defense of what he\ncalls \u201creligious theism.\u201d Whereas Pascal focused his\nattention on the question of whether it is rational to believe in\nGod, Golding is primarily concerned with the question of whether\nit is rational to pursue a religious way of life \u2013 one in\nwhich beliefs about God\u2019s existence might play a relatively\nminor and non-foundational role. To qualify as a religious theist,\nGolding explains, one must seek to enter into a good relationship with\nGod, and for this it is sufficient to believe simply that God\u2019s\nexistence is not impossible (i.e., that the concept of\n\u201cGod\u201d is not contradictory) and that it is at least\nslightly more likely that one can achieve a good relationship with God\nby adopting a religious way of life than by not doing so. Arguing on\nthe basis of the EVP, Golding contends that it is rational to be a\nreligious theist if one conceives of the value of a good relationship\nwith God as \u201cqualitatively superior\u201d to any other\nvalue.\n\nWhereas Pascal held that the payoff of believing in God would be\ninfinite, if God exists, Golding is careful to insist that the value\nof a good relationship with God is finite. Otherwise, as he notes, we\nare faced with the problem \u2013 alluded to above \u2013 that more than\none path might be equally rational for a person in light of its\nexpected value. If, however, the value of a good relationship with God\nis finite, then whichever path is deemed to have the greatest chance\nof success at achieving this reward will have the highest expected\nvalue, other things being equal. Of course, the expected value of the\ngood relationship with God must be higher than the expected value of\nany non-religious pursuit, however likely the latter is to result in a\nmundane payoff. Thus, Golding holds that the value of a good\nrelationship with God should be understood \u201cnot merely as\n\u2018a lot better\u2019 or \u2018vastly better\u2019 than any\nother goal,\u201d but as qualitatively different. Given this\ndifference in kind, Golding concludes that \u201cno quantitative\namount of other goods added together would equal the value\u201d of\nthe good relationship with God (66).\n\nHowever, it is unclear whether Golding\u2019s version of the\n\u201cWager\u201d argument is ultimately more successful than\nPascal\u2019s. The problem is that the EVP requires a single index of\nvalue in accordance with which gambles can be compared, whereas\nGolding\u2019s contention that the value of the good relationship\nwith God is different in kind from other values seems to suggest the\nincommensurability of two different indices. Thus, although the\nargument purports to show that religious theism is a more rational\nchoice, it seems ultimately to hinge not on an objective comparison of\ntwo commensurable quantities but on a preference for goods of a\ncertain type. It might well be the case that certain goods are\npreferable to others, even though there is no single scale of value by\nmeans of which to rank them, but showing this would seem to require a\ndifferent sort of argument than the one Golding presents. In other\nwords, Golding\u2019s quantitative argument in favor of the\nreligious life over the non-religious life seems to be undercut by his\ninsistence that the outcomes being compared are qualitatively\ndifferent.\n\nIn any event, it is worth noting that Pascal and his intellectual\nheirs, though frequently characterized as fideists, are not\nantagonistic to reason tout court. In the first place, as\nPascal sees it, it is reasonable to acknowledge limits to\nreason. \u201cReason\u2019s last step is the recognition that there\nare an infinite number of things which are beyond it\u201d (209). It\nis in this spirit that he suggests, somewhat more elliptically, that\n\u201c[t]here is nothing which is so much in conformity with reason\nas the rejection of reason\u201d (209). Thus, Pascal invokes reason\nto justify what might otherwise appear to be its antithesis. Moreover,\nthe aim of the \u201cWager\u201d argument is precisely to secure the\nrational respectability of faith in the face of an apparent antinomy.\nIn this respect, Pascal\u2019s approach anticipates Kant\u2019s\ncontention that God\u2019s existence is a question for\npractical \u2013 as opposed to\ntheoretical \u2013 reason.\n2.2.2 Kierkegaard\n\nAny discussion of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard\u2019s thought is\ncomplicated by the fact that he wrote pseudonymously, attributing most\nof his writings to a variety of fictional authors whose\n\u201cviews\u201d may or may not have corresponded to his own. In\nThe Point of View for My Work as an Author \u2013 one of the\nfew works to which Kierkegaard (1813\u20131855) was willing to append\nhis own signature \u2013 he explains his use of the pseudonyms by\nnoting that philosophical and religious confusion can be addressed\nonly indirectly: \u201cone must approach from behind the person who\nis under an illusion\u201d (1848, 24\u201325). He adds that the\nillusion against which his pseudonymous writings are directed is an\nillusion about what Christianity requires, and that these writings,\nthough employing philosophical tools, thus subserve a religious\nintent. According to this retrospective self-assessment, the whole of\nKierkegaard\u2019s work \u201cis related to Christianity, to the\nproblem \u2018of becoming a Christian,\u2019 with a direct or\nindirect polemic against the monstrous illusion we call Christendom,\nor against the illusion that in such a land as ours all are Christians\nof a sort\u201d (1848, 5\u20136).\n\nAlthough it is a subject of debate whether to take at face value\nKierkegaard\u2019s claim that his entire work serves a religious\nend \u2013 after all, it seems to be contradicted by other remarks of\nhis \u2013 it is nevertheless clear that combating confusion, including\nillusions about faith, was central to his\n work.[5]\n Kierkegaard suggests that speculative philosophy contributes to this\nconfusion by transforming Christianity into a sort of philosophical\ntheory or system. (Hegel is frequently \u2013 if not always entirely\nfairly \u2013 parodied in this connection.) In so doing, it imports\ninto religion modes of inquiry that distort the essential nature of\nfaith.\n\nIt is perhaps tempting to imagine that the relation between evidence\nand belief is purely epistemological, a question of justification. On\nthis account, beliefs mean what they do irrespective of their relation\nto \u201cthe evidence\u201d; what a consideration of the latter\nreveals is whether or not they are justified. But one of the\nimplications of Kierkegaard\u2019s thought is that entitlement is a\nsocial status, and that the various social practices within which it\nis conferred or withheld contribute to the meaning of the beliefs in\nquestion. There are different kinds of beliefs, logically speaking,\nand different ways in which entitlement to such beliefs is vindicated.\nThe basic error to which philosophical systematizers are prone, he\nargues, is assuming that the criteria for evaluating a belief in one\ncontext are equally appropriate in other contexts. He writes,\n\u201cin our own age everything is mixed together: the aesthetic is\ntreated ethically, faith is dealt with intellectually, and so forth.\nPhilosophy has answered every question; but no adequate consideration\nhas been given the question concerning what sphere it is within which\neach question finds its answer\u201d (Anthology, 229).\n\nWithin the sphere of the \u201cintellectual\u201d \u2013 e.g., within\nscientific or historical scholarship \u2013 inquiry is conceived in\nterms of a process of \u201capproximation\u201d to reality. When it\ncomes to religion, however, what matters, according to Kierkegaard, is\nnot the \u201cobject to which the knower relates himself\u201d but\nthe relationship itself: the accent falls not on \u201cwhat is\nsaid\u201d but on \u201chow it is said\u201d (1846, 199\nand 202). For Kierkegaard, as for the so-called evangelical fideists,\nfaith is characterized by passionate commitment and thus requires a\ndecision or \u201cqualitative leap\u201d (1846, 384). His\nclaim is not simply that having evidence is unnecessary in\nthis context, but that it would, so to speak, destroy the whole\nendeavor, since it would alter the meaning of the beliefs in\nquestion and the spirit in which they could be believed. \u201cIf I\nam able to apprehend God objectively, I do not have faith; but because\nI cannot do this, I must have faith. If I want to keep myself in\nfaith, I must continually see to it that I hold fast the objective\nuncertainty, see to it that in the objective uncertainty I am\n\u2018out on 70,000 fathoms of water\u2019 and still have\nfaith\u201d (1846, 204). Any belief that depended on the outcome of\nhistorical or scientific approximation \u2013 and which could be\nundermined by its results \u2013 would not be genuine faith, and\nanything whose existence could be established purely on the basis of\nphilosophical argument \u2013 and so could be believed in\n\u201cindifferently,\u201d without this belief making a significant\ndifference in one\u2019s life \u2013 would by definition not be God.\n\u201cAnyone who wants to demonstrate the existence of\nGod\u2026proves something else instead, at times something that\nperhaps did not even need demonstrating, and in any case never\nanything better\u201d (1844, 43).\n\nKierkegaard\u2019s point is not that it is somehow permissible to\nneglect one\u2019s epistemic duties where belief in God is concerned,\nbut that one cannot separate the question of \u201cwhat\u201d is\nbelieved from the question of \u201chow\u201d it is believed. (For a\ncontemporary defense of this point, see Strandberg (2011), especially\nChapters 1 and 4.) Here the \u201chow\u201d refers to \u201cthe\nrelationship sustained by the existing individual, in his own\nexistence, to the content of his utterance\u201d\n(Anthology, 214). Religion, for Kierkegaard, is a matter of\nwhat one does with one\u2019s life, a matter of\n\u201cinwardness.\u201d In this context, to observe that religious\nbelievers lack evidence for their beliefs is not to render a negative\nverdict on their entitlement but to comment conceptually on the\nkind of beliefs they are.\n\nWas Kierkegaard a fideist? Critics have argued that in recoiling from\nnatural theology, Kierkegaard transformed belief into a matter of will\nand emotion, and that a decision as monumental as a leap of\nfaith \u2013 made seemingly arbitrarily, in the absence of any rational\nassurance \u2013 might just as easily have disastrous results. J.L.\nMackie, for instance, claims that \u201cwhat Kierkegaard himself is\nadvocating is a sort of intellectual Russian roulette\u201d (216). So\nfar, it might be argued, Kierkegaard has done little to show that a\nleap in the direction of Christianity is a better bet than any of its\nalternatives, and that a wiser tack \u2013 as Hume counseled in\nconnection with alleged miracles \u2013 would be to proportion belief\n(and passion) to the available evidence. Kierkegaard\u2019s defenders\nmight reply that it is only from the \u201coutside\u201d \u2013 from\nthe point of view, e.g., of the dispassionate pseudonyms \u2013 that\nChristianity appears ungrounded and \u201cabsurd,\u201d and that\nKierkegaard\u2019s point is really that those already in possession\nof faith need not be embarrassed by the fact that it is not the\nineluctable outcome of reasoning from an imagined set of neutral and\nuncontested premises.\n\nAlthough he relentlessly criticized what he perceived as the\noverweening ambitions of academic philosophy and an unwarranted\nreliance on foundationalist tendencies in theology, Kierkegaard held\nthat faith and reason are not mutually incompatible, and that\nphilosophy \u2013 when practiced with respect for the \u201cconditions\nof existence\u201d within which human beings necessarily do their\nthinking \u2013 can ultimately help to clarify the nature of Christian\ncommitment. For Kierkegaard, faith is incomprehensible, in\nthe sense that it demands a willingness to venture beyond the purview\nof philosophical reason, but it is not unreasonable or\nirrational. Thus, although he describes faith as\n\u201cbelieving against the understanding,\u201d he is careful to\ndistinguish the content of religious belief from mere\n\u201cnonsense.\u201d The believer \u201ccannot believe nonsense\nagainst the understanding, which one might fear, because the\nunderstanding will penetratingly perceive that it is nonsense and\nhinder him in believing it\u201d; however, the believer \u201cuses\nthe understanding so much that through it he becomes aware of the\nincomprehensible\u201d \u2013 i.e., of the logical limits of\nspeculative thought \u2013 \u201cand now, believing, he relates\nhimself to it against the understanding\u201d (1992, 568). By\ndiscriminating between those cases in which it is competent to judge\nand those in which it is not, philosophy thus plays a self-critical\nrole: mindful of its own limits, it allows religion to be itself.\n2.2.3 James\n\nMackie\u2019s contention that fideism is intellectually irresponsible\nwas anticipated in the nineteenth century by W.K. Clifford, who\nfamously declared that \u201c[i]t is wrong always, everywhere, and\nfor every one, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence\u201d\n(346). The American pragmatist William James (1842\u20131910) called\nClifford \u201cthat delicious enfant terrible,\u201d and in\nhis essay \u201cThe Will to Believe\u201d he argued that Clifford\nhad overstated the case against faith (8). In the paper, James\ndelineates a set of conditions under which, he argues, it can be\nreasonable to believe in the absence of proof.\n\nThese conditions are met whenever we are confronted by what James\nterms a \u201cgenuine option\u201d \u2013 i.e., a choice between two\n(or more) \u201chypotheses\u201d (or candidates for belief) which is\n\u201clive,\u201d \u201cforced,\u201d and\n\u201cmomentous\u201d \u2013 and that option cannot be decided on\nintellectual grounds. An option is live (as opposed to dead) just in\ncase each of the hypotheses at issue is \u201camong the mind\u2019s\npossibilities\u201d (2). Insofar as it depends upon an\nindividual\u2019s willingness or ability to entertain it, a\nhypothesis\u2019 \u201cliveliness\u201d is an extrinsic,\nagent-specific property. By contrast, an option is forced (rather than\navoidable) just in case the candidate hypotheses are both mutually\nexclusive and exhaustive of the possibilities. Finally, an option is\nmomentous (as opposed to trivial) just in case the opportunity is\nunique, the stakes are significant, or the decision is\nirreversible.\n\nJames points out that as people who hold beliefs, we generally have\ntwo goals: to avoid error, and to believe the truth. Though related,\nthese aims are in fact distinct: one can, for example, avoid error by\nsuspending belief. James argues that the scientific method is\noriented around the goal of avoiding error, but that in other aspects\nof life, the avoidance of error is\n inadequate.[6]\n For instance, in our relationships with others, we first have to\nbelieve that others will meet us half-way in order for this\nto be true. If we refused to interact with others until we had\n\u201csufficient evidence\u201d of their willingness to reciprocate,\nwe would no doubt appear stand-offish and unapproachable, thus cutting\nourselves off altogether from the possibility of entering into\nmutually rewarding relationships.\n\nAccording to James, something similar is true in the case of religion.\nReligion, he says, teaches two things: (1) that \u201cthe best things\nare the more eternal things\u201d and (2) that we are better off now\nif we believe (1) (25\u201326). These two assertions together\ncomprise what James refers to as the \u201creligious\nhypothesis.\u201d He contends that if the religious hypothesis is a\nlive hypothesis, the option with which it confronts us is\nnecessarily also a genuine option \u2013 i.e., it is momentous\nand forced. In cases like this, James contends, it is not enough\nsimply to avoid error; we also have to seek truth. \u201cWe cannot\nescape the issue by remaining sceptical and waiting for more light,\nbecause, although we do avoid error in that way if religion be\nuntrue, we lose the good, if it be true, just as\ncertainly as if we positively chose to disbelieve\u201d (26). As in\nthe social example, the religious hypothesis must, as it were, be met\nhalf-way.\n\nJames acknowledges that choosing under such circumstances entails\nrisk \u2013 one might, after all, be wrong \u2013 but he denies that one\ncan avoid or reduce this risk by refusing to choose.\nSkepticism \u2013 i.e., the refusal to choose \u2013 is just as risky as\ncommitment. Furthermore, all such postures are inevitably \u2013 and,\nindeed, completely appropriately \u2013 shaped by one\u2019s passions:\nnot deciding is just as much a matter of emotion as deciding, insofar\nas it is motivated by the fear of being wrong rather than the hope of\nbeing right. But, James contends, there is no rational basis for\npreferring fear over hope.\n\nLike Pascal, James insists that when it comes to religion, we cannot\navoid taking sides and incurring risks. James also agrees with Pascal\nthat faith can be rational in the absence of epistemic\njustification \u2013 at least in certain circumstances. However,\nJames\u2019s argument differs from Pascal\u2019s insofar as it\npurports to show, not that religious belief is more rational,\nbut only that in the absence of definitive evidence it is not\nless rational, than unbelief or agnosticism (at least with\nrespect to those for whom the religious hypothesis is live).\n\nAlthough he disagrees with Clifford about the justifiability of\nbelieving without conclusive proof, James appears to share\nClifford\u2019s view that \u2013 at least in certain\ncases \u2013 belief is subject to the will (hence the title of his\nessay). In other words, James\u2019s argument in \u201cThe Will to\nBelieve,\u201d like Pascal\u2019s wager argument, seems to imply\nsome version of doxastic voluntarism. But depending on how this latter\nnotion is understood, certain worries may here arise. If belief is\nunderstood as a function of one\u2019s total epistemic situation,\nrather than an independent judgment which that situation might or\nmight not warrant, then James\u2019s analogy between believing and\nentering into a relationship appears problematic: only the latter is\nsubject to direct voluntary control. Of course, believing is subject\nto indirect voluntary control. In other words, one can change\none\u2019s beliefs by changing one\u2019s epistemic circumstances;\nthe latter, even if not the former, are susceptible to direct control\nby the will. James himself acknowledges that, in the vast majority of\ncases, beliefs are not modifiable at will: \u201cCan we, by just\nwilling it, believe that Abraham Lincoln\u2019s existence is a myth,\nand that the portraits of him in McClure\u2019s Magazine are\nall of someone else? Can we, by any effort of our will, or by any\nstrength of wish that it were true, believe ourselves well and about\nwhen we are roaring with rheumatism in bed, or feel certain that the\nsum of the two one-dollar bills in our pocket must be a hundred\ndollars?\u201d (4\u20135) James appears to take the position that it\nis only with respect to live hypotheses that the will can\nplay a role.\n\nA related objection is that James does not appear to take account of\nthe possibility of \u201cpartial beliefs,\u201d and that doing so\nundermines his notion of a forced option. If believing admits of\ndegrees, then choices of the kind James describes seem less stark.\nResponding to this kind of anticipated objection to his own work\n(described in Section 4 below), John Bishop has argued that a forced\nchoice is required whenever one is confronted by the rival\n\u201cframing principles\u201d of alternative doxastic practices.\n\u201cOne either \u2018buys into\u2019 the framework by commitment\nto its principles or one does not\u201d (139).\n\nJames\u2019s essay is intended as a \u201cdefence of our right to\nadopt a believing attitude in religious matters, in spite of the fact\nthat our merely logical intellect may not have been coerced\u201d\n(1\u20132). Some critics have worried that the argument leads down a\nslippery slope to irrationalism. John Hick has claimed that\nJames\u2019s conclusion \u201cconstitutes an unrestricted license\nfor wishful thinking\u2026 If our aim is to believe what is true,\nand not necessarily what we like, James\u2019s universal\npermissiveness will not help us\u201d (60). However, this seems\nunfair. James insists that in defending the \u201clawfulness of\nvoluntarily adopted faith\u201d he is not thereby opening the door to\nwhat he calls \u201cpatent superstition\u201d (2, 29). Faith, on\nJames\u2019s account, is not a matter of believing against\nthe evidence; the \u201cwill to believe\u201d is justified only when\nthe option is genuine and the evidence is inconclusive. \u201cIn\nconcreto,\u201d James writes, \u201cthe freedom to believe can\nonly cover living options which the intellect of the individual cannot\nby itself resolve; and living options never seem absurdities to him\nwho has them to consider\u201d (29).\n\nIt is important to appreciate that James is not claiming that\nit is morally permissible to believe something to which one is not\nepistemically entitled. Rather, he is claiming that there are beliefs\nto which one can be epistemically entitled even in the absence of\ndefinitive evidence \u2013 that, pace Clifford, entitlement is\nnot always a function of evidential support. Although James\u2019s\nargument is often classified as a pragmatic argument for belief, he is\nnot offering a prudential, as opposed to an epistemic,\njustification. Rather, he is comparing the relative merits of rival\nepistemic strategies (oriented respectively toward the goals of\navoiding error and believing truth). In this respect his argument\ndiffers importantly from Pascal\u2019s \u201cwager\u201d arguments.\nIt can thus be argued that James is not disparaging reason in favor of\nfaith, but attempting rather to carve out a sphere for faith within\nwhat is rationally respectable.\n2.2.4 Wittgenstein\n\nWidely regarded as one of the greatest philosophers of the twentieth\ncentury, Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889\u20131951) was also one of the\nmost controversial and difficult. Wittgenstein famously argued that\n\u201cmeaning is use\u201d \u2013 that our words mean what they do by\nvirtue of the role they play in our discourse. Moreover, he argued\nthat words are used in more than one way, and that it is a mistake to\n\u201csublime the logic\u201d of our language \u2013 i.e., to treat\nany single function of language as paradigmatic. \u201cThink of the\ntools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver,\na rule, a glue-pot, nails and screws. \u2013 The functions of words are\nas diverse as the functions of these objects\u201d (1958, I,\n\u00a711).\n\nIn his later writings, Wittgenstein calls these diverse phenomena\nlanguage-games, in order, he explains, \u201cto bring into\nprominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of\nan activity, or a form of life\u201d (1958, I, \u00a723). Renouncing\nhis own earlier quest for a general form of propositions, his later\nwritings suggest that these language-games \u201chave no one thing in\ncommon which makes us use the same word for all, \u2013 but that they\nare related to one another in many different ways\u201d\n(1958, I, \u00a765).\n\nAlthough Wittgenstein was not by conventional standards\nreligious, his philosophical remarks and journal entries\nreveal what might be described as a religious sensibility and are\ninformed by a definite sympathy toward at least certain features of\nreligion. For Wittgenstein, as for Kierkegaard, whom he admired,\nreligion was less a matter of theory than of practice. \u201cI\nbelieve that one of the things Christianity says is that sound\ndoctrines are all useless. They have to change your life. (Or\nthe direction of your life.)\u2026Wisdom is passionless.\nBut faith by contrast is what Kierkegaard calls a\npassion\u201d (1980, 53e).\n\nIt has been argued that Wittgenstein\u2019s later thought, though\nperhaps not overtly fideistic, nevertheless lends itself to fideistic\ninterpretation. According to this interpretation, religion is a\nself-contained and primarily expressive enterprise, governed by its\nown internal logic or \u201cgrammar.\u201d This view \u2013 commonly\ncalled Wittgensteinian Fideism \u2013 is variously\ncharacterized as entailing one or more of the following distinct (but\narguably inter-related) theses: (1) that religion is logically cut off\nfrom other aspects of life; (2) that religious discourse is\nessentially self-referential and does not allow us to talk about\nreality; (3) that religious beliefs can be understood only by\nreligious believers; and (4) that religion cannot be\n criticized.[7]\n\nIt is highly doubtful, however, whether Wittgenstein would have\nendorsed any of these claims, let alone all four of them. Their\nattribution to Wittgenstein seems in fact to depend on a narrowly\nselective reading of what he actually said. As Richard Bell has\npointed out,\n\nIt is premised on the view that our language is a series of\nlanguage-games rooted in a form of life each governed by its own set\nof rules \u2013 as if our life of speaking and acting were like a bag\nof marbles, separate spherical speech-worlds with their own boundaries\nand rules governing their size and elasticity and use \u2013 some are\nshooters, others decorative, all rest side by side and affect their\nneighbors only if they collide (217\u2013218).\n\n\nIt is true that Wittgenstein cautioned against the tendency to assume\na unity of logical form behind the diversity of actual usage. He\nwrites, \u201cDon\u2019t say: \u2018There must be\nsomething common\u2026\u2019 \u2013 but look and see\u201d\n(1958, I, \u00a766). However, it is by no means clear that he intended\nto advance any equally a priori thesis about the\ndiscontinuity and incommensurability of our discursive practices.\n\nIndeed, he suggests that the result of \u201clooking\u201d is that\n\u201cwe see a complicated network of similarities overlapping and\ncriss-crossing\u201d (1958, I, \u00a766). A metaphor to which he\nreturns periodically is of language as an ancient city:\n\u201ca maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses,\nand of houses with additions from various periods; and this surrounded\nby a multitude of new boroughs with straight regular streets and\nuniform houses\u201d (1958, I, \u00a718). Remarks such as these seem\nto militate against the siloed view of language implied by\nWittgensteinian Fideism.\n\nIt also should be noted that the term \u201cWittgensteinian\nFideism\u201d appeared after Wittgenstein\u2019s death but prior to\nthe publication in English of some of his most important writings on\nreligion, including Lectures on Religious Belief (1967),\nRemarks on Frazer\u2019s Golden Bough (1979), and\nCulture and Value (1980) \u2013 i.e., at a time when\nWittgenstein\u2019s legacy was particularly vulnerable to\nmisinterpretation.\n\nThe origins of the term \u201cWittgensteinian Fideism\u201d derive\nfrom an essay of that name by Kai Nielsen, which appeared in the July\n1967 issue of Philosophy. There Nielsen suggested that\nWittgensteinian Fideism might in fact constitute a misrepresentation\nof Wittgenstein\u2019s writings \u2013 not, interestingly enough, by\nhis critics, but by his followers \u2013 and that\n\u201cWittgenstein might well wish to say of Wittgensteinians what\nFreud said of Freudians\u201d (194). Accordingly, Nielsen directed\nthe brunt of his critique not against Wittgenstein himself, but\nagainst Wittgensteinians like Norman Malcolm and Peter Winch. More\nrecently, the charge of Wittgensteinian Fideism has become associated\nespecially with the work of the philosopher of religion D.Z.\nPhillips.\n\nAlthough it is impossible here to explore these allegations in any\ndetail, it is worth noting that Wittgensteinians generally regard\n\u201cWittgensteinian Fideism\u201d as a caricature not only of\nWittgenstein\u2019s views but also of their own. In defending himself\nand other Wittgensteinian philosophers of religion against the charge\nof fideism, Phillips writes:\n\nMany philosophers of religion influenced by Wittgenstein have spent\nmuch of their time denying that connections of a certain kind\nhold between religious beliefs and other aspects of human life.\nSimilarly, they have denied the appropriateness of certain\nkinds of criticisms of religion. Those who have been criticized\noften react as follows: \u201cThis is what I mean by the connection\nbetween religion and other aspects of human life and this is what I\nmean by criticism of religion. Here [are] Phillips and others like him\ndenying the intelligibility of such connections and criticism.\nTherefore Phillips and others like him hold that there is no\nconnection between religion and other aspects of human life and that\nreligion cannot be criticized.\u201d Of course, all that I and others\nhave denied is their conception of the relation between\nreligion and other aspects of human life and their conception\nof criticism of religion. Sometimes, the explanation of the\npersistence of the critical theses concerning Wittgenstein\u2019s\ninfluence in the philosophy of religion\u2026is as simple as that\n(1981, 89\u201390).\n\n\nIn the last decade of his life, Phillips in fact devoted considerable\nattention to what, following his teacher Rush Rhees, he called the\nunity \u2013 i.e., the interlocking intelligibility \u2013 of\ndiscourse. He argued that religious beliefs depend for their sense and\nimportance on non-religious features of human existence, but that the\nrelation between the former and the latter is not generally the\nrelation between conclusions and their justification.\n\nPhillips\u2019s longstanding debate with Nielsen is commonly\nportrayed as a modern-day contest between faith and reason, but\nPhillips never regarded it that way himself. Whereas Nielsen treats\nPhillips\u2019s \u201ccontemplative\u201d approach to philosophy of\nreligion as essentially an apologetic strategy meant to shield belief\nin God from criticism, Phillips contended that \u201cit casts a\nliberating light on both belief and atheism. Both are rescued\nfrom philosophical distortion\u201d (2005, 75). As Phillips saw it,\nhis disagreement with Nielsen was a disagreement not between the\nadvocates of competing first-order commitments, but between\nNielsen\u2019s atheism and his own professed desire to do conceptual\njustice to rival points of view, both religious and\nanti-religious \u2013 an asymmetry that the term \u201cfideism,\u201d\nwith its pietistic connotations, seemed to him to obscure.\n",
