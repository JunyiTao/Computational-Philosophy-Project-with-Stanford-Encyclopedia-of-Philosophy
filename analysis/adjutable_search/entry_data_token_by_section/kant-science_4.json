    "main_text": "Physics: The Critical Period (Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science) || Dynamics\n2.3 Dynamics\n\nThe second chapter of the Metaphysical Foundations, the\nDynamics, considers how it is possible to experience matter as filling\na determinate region in space. Propositions 1\u20134 are devoted to\nexhibiting the nature and necessity of repulsive forces. In\nProposition 1 Kant argues that repulsive force is required for matter\nto fill space, since solidity, understood by \u201cLambert and\nothers\u201d as the property matter would have by means of \u201cits\nmere existence\u201d (4:497), cannot truly explain how one\nmatter resists another matter\u2019s attempt to penetrate it. Kant\nthen specifies several central features of repulsive forces in\nPropositions 2 and 3. Repulsive forces admit of degrees to infinity,\nsince one must always be able to think of a slightly greater or lesser\nforce, and although matter can be compressed to infinity, it can never\nbe penetrated, since that would require an infinite compressing force,\nwhich is impossible.\n\nIn Proposition 4 Kant draws an important consequence from his\ncharacterization of repulsive forces, namely that matter is infinitely\ndivisible (4:503). What is especially striking about this point is\nthat it represents a significant departure from his own earlier\nPhysical Monadology, where he had accepted attractive and\nrepulsive forces, but denied the infinite divisibility of what\nultimately constitutes matter, namely physical points or monads. It is\ntrue that part of Kant\u2019s rationale for his change of position on\nthis point stems from the \u201ccritical turn\u201d undertaken in\nthe Critique of Pure Reason (and in its Second Antinomy in\nparticular). For once one recognizes that both space and spatial\nproperties such as divisibility are not properties of things in\nthemselves but rather only appearances, one can reject the proposition\nthat seems to necessitate the acceptance of simple substances, namely\nthe idea that simple substances must precede the wholes they compose\n(4:506). However, Kant\u2019s proof also seems to depend, in its\ndetails, not merely on the idea that every space is filled by means of\nsome repulsive force or other, but on the stronger claim that\nevery space is divisible into smaller spaces that are filled by\ndifferent repulsive forces.\n\nPropositions 5\u20138 are all devoted to attractive force. In\nProposition 5 Kant argues that matter must have an attractive force in\norder to fill space. Kant\u2019s argument is that if there were only\nrepulsive forces, then matter \u201cwould disperse itself to\ninfinity\u201d (4:508) since neither space nor other matter could\nlimit it. Proposition 6 argues that both attractive and repulsive\nforces must be considered essential to matter. That is, attractive\nforces alone are not sufficient to account for matter filling a space,\nsince if matter consisted solely of attractive forces, there would be\nno force to counteract the attractive force being exercised and the\nuniverse would collapse into a single point. Together, Propositions 5\nand 6 make up a \u2018balancing argument\u2019, which Kant had\nalready used in the earlier Physical Monadology. (A balancing\nargument is an existence proof for a type of force. Its premises are\n(1) an accepted universal fact, viz. that a certain stable\nconfiguration obtains; and (2) a type of force independently known to\nexist. The argument seeks to prove that the stability in question is\nimpossible unless a second kind of force exists to balance the first\nkind. In Kant\u2019s particular version of the balancing argument,\nthe universal fact is the constancy of mass density in a control\nvolume; and the given force is \u201coriginal repulsion,\u201d whose\nexistence he proves in Proposition 4.) Proposition 7 then specifies\nhow attractive forces are to be understood, namely as the immediate\naction of matter on other matter through empty space (and therefore at\na distance). Kant thus directly confronts the metaphysical question of\nhow to understand attraction that Newton attempted to avoid by\npositing it merely mathematically. As Kant interprets the situation,\nNewton \u201cabstracts from all hypotheses purporting to answer the\nquestion as to the cause of the universal attraction of matter\n\u2026 [since] this question is physical or metaphysical, but not\nmathematical\u201d (4:515). In response to the \u201cmost common\nobjection to immediate action at a distance,\u201d namely \u201cthat\na matter cannot act immediately where it is not\u201d\n(4:513), Kant argues that action at a distance is no more problematic\nthan action by contact (whether it be by collision or pressure), since\nin both cases a body is simply acting outside itself. Proposition 8\nconcludes by arguing that attractive forces act immediately to\ninfinity and by adding a \u201cpreliminary suggestion\u201d (4:518)\nas to how one might be able to construct the concept of cohesion\n(which Kant understands as attraction that is restricted to\ncontact).\n\nIn the General Remark to Dynamics Kant addresses two main issues.\nFirst, Kant considers how it is that the specific varieties of matter\n(e.g., water as different from mercury) might be reduced, at least in\nprinciple, to the fundamental forces of attraction and repulsion. The\nsecond issue concerns the fundamental distinction between the\n\u201cmathematical-mechanical\u201d and the\n\u201cmetaphysical-dynamical mode of explanation\u201d. The former\nmode of explanation, which is associated with the postulation of atoms\nand the void, employs nothing more than the shapes and motions of\nfundamental particles and empty interstices interspersed among them.\nIt contrasts with the metaphysical-dynamical mode, which employs\nfundamental moving forces (e.g., attraction and repulsion) in its\nexplanations. Kant grants that the mathematical-mechanical mode has an\nadvantage over the metaphysical-dynamical mode, since its fundamental\nposits can be represented (indeed, \u201cverified\u201d (4:525))\nmathematically, whereas he repeatedly admits that the possibility of\nfundamental forces can never be comprehended, i.e., their possibility\ncan never be rendered certain. However, Kant thinks that this\nadvantage is outweighed by two disadvantages. First, by presupposing\nabsolute impenetrability, the mathematical-mechanical mode of\nexplanation accepts an \u201cempty concept\u201d at its foundation.\nSecond, by giving up all forces that would be inherent in matter, such\na mode of explanation provides the imagination with more freedom\n\u201cthan is truly consistent with the caution of philosophy\u201d\n(4:525).\n\nGiven that the bulk of Kant\u2019s matter theory is presented in the\nDynamics, it is unsurprising that it has received the greatest amount\nof attention in the literature. Of particular note are discussions by\nBuchdahl (1968, 1969), Brittan (1978), Kitcher (1983), Butts (1986),\nCarrier (1990), Friedman (1990), Malzkorn (1998), Warren (2001, 2010),\nPollok (2002), Holden (2004), and Engelhard (2005). Friedman (2013) is\nan extensive commentary, under the overarching theme that Kant in the\nDynamics aims to explain how certain features of body \u2013 density,\nvolume, static weight \u2013 become mathematizable, as Newton\u2019s\ndynamics illustrates paradigmatically. Two chapters (by McNulty and\nWarren, respectively) in McNulty 2022 add to our understanding of this\naspect in Kant\u2019s thought.\n",
