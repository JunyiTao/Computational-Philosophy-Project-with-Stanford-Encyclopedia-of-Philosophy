    "main_text": "Five Theories of Quotation || The Description Theory of Quotation\n3.2 The Description Theory of Quotation\n\nThe Description Theory of Quotation was introduced in order to\nguarantee that \u2018a quoted series of expressions is always a\nseries of quoted expressions\u2019 (Geach 1957, p. 82) and not\n\u2018a single long word, whose parts have no separate\nsignificance\u2019 (ibid., p. 82). According to this theory,\nthere is a set of basic units in each language: words, according to\nGeach (ibid., Ch. 18 and 1970); letters, according to Tarski\n(1956, p. 160) and Quine (1960, p. 143, p.\n 212)).[6]\n\nThis view retains the Proper Name Theory for basic quotations, e.g.,\naccording to Quine, \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d is a name of one letter,\n\u201c\\(b\\)\u201d a name of another, etc. For Geach, each word\nhas a quotation name. Complex quotations, i.e., quotations with more\nthan one basic unit, are understood as descriptions of concatenations\nof the basic units. Here is an illustration from Geach (where\n\u2018-\u2019 is his sign for concatenation):\n\n\u2026the quotation \u2018\u2018man is mortal\u2019\u2019 is\nrightly understood only if we read it as meaning the same as\n\u2018\u2018man\u2019-\u2018is\u2019-\u2018mortal\u2019\u2019,\ni.e., read it as describing the quoted expression in terms of\nthe expressions it contains and their order. (Geach 1957, pp.\n82\u201383)\n\n\nFor Quine and Tarski, (4) gets analyzed as (18):\n\n(4)\n\u2018Bachelor\u2019 has eight letters.\n(18)\n\n\u2018B\u2019-\u2018a\u2019-\u2018c\u2019-\u2018h\u2019-\u2018e\u2019-\u2018l\u2019-\u2018o\u2019-\u2018r\u2019\nhas eight letters\n\n\nwhere \u2018-\u2019 is their sign for concatenation and the\nindividual quotations are names of the letters.\n\nDavidson characterizes the difference between the two versions as\nfollows:\n\nIn primitive notation, which reveals all structure to the eye, Geach\nhas an easier time writing (for only each word needs quotation marks)\nbut a harder time learning or describing the language (he has a much\nlarger primitive vocabulary\u2014twice normal size if we disregard\niteration). (Davidson 1979, p. 84)\n\n\nThat is to say, if Geach\u2019s theory were true, the appropriate\nrepresentation of (4) is simply (4), whereas for Tarski and Quine\nit\u2019s the much more unwieldy (18). On the other hand, a Geachian\nlanguage has (at least) twice as many words as we might expect: for\neach word in the dictionary, there would also be the word that stands\nfor that word (got by enclosing the initial word in quotation\nmarks).\n3.2.1 Strengths and Weaknesses of the Description Theory\n\nIn one respect the Description Theory is an immense improvement over\nthe Proper Name Theory: it deals with no more than a finite set of\nbasic names, thus, potentially accommodating (BQ5). In other respects,\nhowever, the theory is, by a wide consensus, not much of an\nimprovement over the Proper Name Theory. At the basic level, the\ntheory still treats quotations as names. So, at that level, it\ninherits many of the problems confronting the simpler Proper Name\nTheory. Some of the more obvious objections are these (again we\nmention only some of the most obvious ones here since the theory is\nnot central to contemporary discussions):\n\nAt the basic level (i.e., the level of words or letters),\nthere\u2019s no rule for determining how to interpret and generate\nnovel quotations (BQ3). This is so because there is no a\npriori reason to believe there are finitely many basic\nexpressions (cf., Lepore 1999).\nAt the basic level, it doesn\u2019t explain the special\nrelationship between the expression and the quotation of that\nexpression (BQ4). It\u2019s obvious to us that \u201cSam\u201d and\n\u201cAlice\u201d do not refer to the same expression, but how can\nGeach explain this triviality if both are just proper names; ditto for\nQuine with respect to \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d (cf.,\nDavidson 1979, p. 87).\nAt the basic level, it fails to account for dual use and mention\n(BQ6). This is particularly a problem for Geach\u2019s version. Any\naccount, including the Proper Name Theory, according to which the\nsemantic function of word-tokens inside quotation marks is just to\nrefer to word-types (or some other type of linguistic entity) fails to\nassign correct truth-conditions to (12). In essence, it predicts that\n(12) is syntactically equivalent to something like \u2018Quine said\nthat quotation the phrase\u2019, which is ungrammatical as containing\na definite description where a verb phrase should be.\nAccording to Davidson (1979, pp. 86\u201387), the Description\nTheory can\u2019t explain why we can\u2019t quantify into quotation\n(i.e. it fails to account for BQ2). Roughly, the thought seems to be\nthat we can existentially generalize from (4) to \u2018some word has\neight letters\u2019. But by a similar sort of reasoning, we should be\nable to move from (18) to \u2018some letter is that such that\n\u2018B\u2019-\u2018a\u2019-\u2018c\u2019-\u2018h\u2019-\u2018e\u2019-\u2018l\u2019-it-\u2018r\u2019\nhas eight letters\u2019. But clearly no such move can be made.\n\n",
