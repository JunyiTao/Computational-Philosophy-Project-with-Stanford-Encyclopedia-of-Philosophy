    "main_text": "Truthbearers, Truthmakers, Truth || Truth\n2.3 Truth\n\n\nThe abstract noun \u201ctruth\u201d has various uses. (a)\nIt can be used to refer to the general relational property\notherwise referred to as being true; though the latter label\nwould be more perspicuous, it is rarely used, even in philosophical\ndiscussions. (b) The noun \u201ctruth\u201d can be used to\nrefer to the concept that \u201cpicks out\u201d the\nproperty and is expressed in English by the adjective\n\u201ctrue\u201d. Some authors do not distinguish between concept\nand property; others do, or should: an account of the concept might\ndiffer significantly from an account of the property. To mention just\none example, one might maintain, with some plausibility, that an\naccount of the concept ought to succumb to the liar paradox\n(see the entry on the liar paradox),\notherwise it wouldn\u2019t be an adequate account of our\nconcept of truth; this idea is considerably less plausible in the case\nof the property. Any proposed \u201cdefinition of truth\u201d might\nbe intend as a definition of the property or of the concept or both;\nits author may or may not be alive to the difference. (c) The\nnoun \u201ctruth\u201d can be used, finally, to refer to some set of\ntrue truthbarers (possibly unknown), as in: \u201cThe truth is out\nthere\u201d, and: \u201cThe truth about this matter will never be\nknown\u201d.\n",
