The set theory of the continuum\n\nFrom Cantor and until about 1940, set theory developed mostly around\nthe study of the continuum, that is, the real line \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). The\nmain topic was the study of the so-called regularity properties, as\nwell as other structural properties, of simply-definable sets of real\nnumbers, an area of mathematics that is known as Descriptive Set\nTheory.\n",
