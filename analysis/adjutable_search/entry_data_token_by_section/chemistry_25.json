    "main_text": "Modeling and Chemical Explanation\n7. Modeling and Chemical Explanation\n\nAlmost all contemporary chemical theorizing involves modeling, the\nindirect description and analysis of real chemical phenomena by way of\nmodels. From the 19th century onwards, chemistry was\ncommonly taught and studied with physical models of molecular\nstructure. Beginning in the 20th century, mathematical\nmodels based on classical and quantum mechanics were successfully\napplied to chemical systems. This section discusses some of the\nphilosophical questions that arise when we consider modeling in\nchemistry more directly.\n",
