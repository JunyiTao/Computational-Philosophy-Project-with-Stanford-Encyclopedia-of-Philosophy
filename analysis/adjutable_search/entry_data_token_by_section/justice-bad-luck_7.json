    "main_text": "Neutralizing Luck and Equality\n8. Neutralizing Luck and Equality\n\nMany passages in the luck egalitarian literature suggest that justice\nis luck-neutralization, not luck-amplification, not luck-mitigation\n(Mason 2006), and not luck-equalization. Consider, for instance,\nRawls\u2019 remark that \u201cIntuitively, the most obvious\ninjustice of the system of natural liberty is that it permits\ndistributive shares to be improperly influenced by these factors\n[i.e., social circumstances and such chance contingencies as accident\nand good fortune] so arbitrary from a moral point of view\u201d\n(Rawls 1971, 71). On the admittedly disputable assumption that Rawls\nthinks that factors that are \u201carbitrary from a moral point of\nview\u201d and affect people\u2019s interests are a matter of luck,\none might read this passage as saying that under a just distribution,\nluck does not influence distributive shares (Rawls 1971, 72). As we\nsaw in Section 2 a similar passage can be found in Cohen\u2019s work:\n\u201canyone who thinks that initial advantage and inherent capacity\nare unjust distributors thinks so because he believes that they make a\nperson\u2019s fate depend too much on sheer luck\u201d (Cohen 1989,\n932). This passage can be read as suggesting that the aim of\nneutralizing luck justifies equality and that realizing equality will\neliminate luck.\n\nSuch passages can, however, be read in other ways. Thus Rawls might\nsimply mean to say that, while luck influences distributive shares\nunder a just distribution, it does not do so improperly. Likewise,\nCohen might be saying that, while people\u2019s fates depend on luck\nunder a just distribution, they do not depend on sheer luck. And the\nfact that there is room for these different readings encourages us to\nask exactly what role luck-neutralization can play in relation to a\ntheory of distributive justice.\n\nAddressing this question, Susan Hurley distinguishes between a\nspecificatory and a justificatory role for the aim of\nluck-neutralization. In the first role, the aim specifies what\negalitarianism \u201cis and what it demands\u201d (Hurley 2003,\n147). In the second, it provides a justification for favoring\negalitarian over non-egalitarian theories of distributive justice.\nHurley believes that the luck-neutralizing aim fails in both roles. If\nthe aim were to play either role, it would have to be the case that\nthe favored distribution\u2014e.g., equality, utility maximization,\nor maximizing the position of the worst off\u2014limits the influence\nof luck on outcomes. However, there is no clear sense in which this is\nthe case (compare Parfit, 1995, 12). For the sake of simplicity,\nsuppose the favored distribution is an equal one. Suppose also that\nthe inequality that we are concerned with exists between two people\nwho have each been stranded on a small island. Through sheer good\nluck, the first person\u2019s island is lush and fertile, and through\nsheer bad luck the other person\u2019s island is arid. It does not\nfollow from the fact that this unequal outcome is the result of luck\nthat, if we eliminate the inequality, the resulting equal outcome will\nnot to the same degree be the result of luck, i.e., will not be one in\nwhich factors for which people are not responsible play no (or a\nsmaller) causal role in bringing about the outcome. To see this,\nassume we are dealing with thick, control-based responsibility luck\nand imagine that a powerful egalitarian intervener dumps a shipload of\nfertilizer on the second island so that equality in the Robinson\nCrusoe-like setting is realized. Since neither of the two people\ncontrolled what happened, the resulting equality here is just as much\na matter of luck for them as the prior inequality was. Since we can\nimplement equality without eliminating luck, this shows that we can\nneither justify equality as a means of neutralizing luck, nor specify\nwhat equality requires as neutralizing luck. The same applies to other\nend-result principles (Hurley 2003, 146\u201380).\n\nIn response to this important point, it might be argued that when\nluck-egalitarians write about \u201cneutralizing luck\u201d, this is\nreally short-hand for something like \u201celiminating the\ndifferential effects on people\u2019s interests of factors which from\ntheir perspective are a matter of luck.\u201d This is no different\nfrom saying that affirmative action in favor of women is a way of\nneutralizing the effects of sexist discrimination. In saying this, we\ndo not imagine that affirmative action removes sexist discrimination\nand all its effects; we mean merely that the affirmative action\nprogram eliminates the differential effects on men and women of sexist\ndiscrimination (e.g., in university admissions). On this reading,\nconsiderations about luck serve, not to justify equality, but to\nselect the appropriate egalitarian view from among the large family of\nviews that ascribe intrinsic significance to equality. As Arneson puts\nit: \u201cThe argument for equal opportunity rather than straight\nequality is simply that it is morally fitting to hold individuals\nresponsible for the foreseeable consequences of their voluntary\nchoices\u201d (Arneson 1989, 88). Equality is the default position,\nmorally speaking. It is not justified by appeal to luck. Such an\nappeal, however, explains why some deviations from this default\nposition need not be bad from an egalitarian point of view, for in the\nrelevant deviations it is not a matter of luck that some people are\nworse off than others. In response to Hurley\u2019s point, Cohen\noffers a related reply: \u201cThat it extinguishes the influence of\nluck is no more of an argument for egalitarianism than that it\npromotes utility is an argument for utilitarianism and in each case\nfor the same reason, to wit, that the cited feature is too definitive\nof the position in question to justify the position in question\u201d\n(Cohen 2006, 441\u2013442; see also Vallentyne 2006, 434; Hurley\n2006, 459\u2013465). In fact, he goes on to offer something which is\nmore radical than the short-hand description of the luck-egalitarian\naim offered in the opening sentence of this paragraph. Since\nluck-egalitarians are opposed to luck \u201cin the name of\nfairness\u201d (compare Temkin 2003(a), 767) and since, no less than\ninequality, equality is unfair when \u201cin disaccord with\nchoice\u201d, equality might be unjust for exactly the same reason as\ninequality might (Cohen 2006, 444; cf. Segall 2012). Pragmatic, not\nprincipled, reasons explain why unjust equalities tend to not to be\nmentioned by luck-egalitarians.\n\nFor a further discussion of the notion of bad and good luck, see the\nfollowing supplementary document:\n Bad Luck Versus Good Luck.\n",
