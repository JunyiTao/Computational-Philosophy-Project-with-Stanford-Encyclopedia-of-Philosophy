    "main_text": "What is Substance?\n5. What is Substance?\n\nIn the seventeen chapters that make up Book \u0396 of the\nMetaphysics, Aristotle takes up the promised study of\nsubstance. He begins by reiterating and refining some of what he said\nin \u0393: that \u2018being\u2019 is said in many ways, and that\nthe primary sense of \u2018being\u2019 is the sense in which\nsubstances are beings. Here, however, he explicitly links the\nsecondary senses of \u2018being\u2019 to the non-substance\ncategories. The primacy of substance leads Aristotle to say that the\nage-old question \u2018What is being?\u2019 \u201cis just the\nquestion \u2018What is substance?\u2019\u201d\n(1028b4).\n\nOne might have thought that this question had already been answered in\nthe Categories. There we were given, as examples of primary\nsubstances, an individual man or horse, and we learned that a primary\nsubstance is \u201cwhat is neither in a subject nor said of a\nsubject\u201d (2a10). This would seem to provide us with\nboth examples of, and criteria for being, primary substances. But in\nMetaphysics \u0396, Aristotle does not seem to take either\nthe examples or the criteria for granted.\n\nIn \u0396.2 he recounts the various answers that have been given to\nthe question of which things are substances\u2014bodies (including\nplants, animals, the parts of plants and animals, the elements, the\nheavenly bodies), things more basic than bodies (surfaces, lines, and\npoints), imperceptible things (such as Platonic Forms and mathematical\nobjects)\u2014and seems to regard them all as viable candidates at\nthis point. He does not seem to doubt that the clearest examples of\nsubstances are perceptible ones, but leaves open the question whether\nthere are others as well.\n\nBefore answering this question about examples, however, he says that\nwe must first answer the question about criteria: what is it to be a\nsubstance (t\u00ean ousian pr\u00f4ton ti estin)? The\nnegative criterion (\u201cneither in a subject nor said of a\nsubject\u201d) of the Categories tells us only which things\nare substances. But even if we know that something is a\nsubstance, we must still say what makes it a\nsubstance\u2014what the cause is of its being a substance. This is\nthe question to which Aristotle next turns. To answer it is to\nidentify, as Aristotle puts it, the substance of that\nthing.\n",
