    "main_text": "Historical Background || Church\u2019s Thesis\n1.6 Church\u2019s Thesis\n\nBy formalizing his informal characterization of recursiveness via\n Definition 1.2,\n G\u00f6del succeeded in formulating a definition which subsumes the\nprimitive recursion scheme (\\ref{gprimrec}), the definition of the\nAckermann-P\u00e9ter function, as well as several other schemes\nconsidered by Hilbert. G\u00f6del\u2019s definition of general\nrecursiveness thus also defined a class \\(\\mathbf{GR}\\) of functions\nof type \\(\\mathbb{N}^k \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}\\) which properly\nsubsumes the primitive recursive functions \\(\\mathbf{PR}\\). Moreover,\nwe now know that the class of functions representable in\n\\(\\mathsf{P}\\) (and in fact in far weaker arithmetical systems)\ncorresponds not to the primitive recursive functions, but rather to\nthe general recursive functions. Weakening the hypothesis that the set\nof (G\u00f6del numbers) of the axioms of a formal system to the\nrequirement that they be general recursive rather than primitive\nrecursive thus indeed provides a generalization of the First\nIncompleteness Theorem the manner in which G\u00f6del envisioned.\n\nThe definition of \\(\\mathbf{GR}\\) is also of historical importance\nbecause it was the first among several equivalent (and nearly\ncontemporaneous) definitions of what were originally called the\nrecursive functions but are now often referred to as the\ncomputable functions (see\n Section 2.2).\n These developments also contributed to one of the two final chapters\nin the study of recursive definability prior to the initiation of\ncomputability theory as an independent subject\u2014i.e., the\nisolation and eventual adoption of what is now known as\nChurch\u2019s Thesis.\n\nChurch\u2019s Thesis corresponds to the claim that the class of\nfunctions which are computable by a finite mechanical\nprocedure\u2014or, as it is traditionally said, are effectively\ncomputable\u2014coincides with the class of general recursive\nfunctions\u2014i.e.,\n\n(CT)\n\\(f:\\mathbb{N}^k \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}\\) is\neffectively computable if and only if \\(f \\in \\mathbf{GR}\\).\n\n\nIt may appear that G\u00f6del already proposed a version of\nChurch\u2019s Thesis in 1934. However, he did not immediately endorse\nit upon its first explicit articulation by\n Church.[14]\n And since the surrounding history is complex it will be useful to\nrecord the following observations as a prelude to\n Sections 2 and 3.[15]\n (See also the entries on\n Church\u2019s Thesis\n and\n computational complexity theory.)\n\nG\u00f6del delivered the lectures (G\u00f6del 1934) while he was\nvisiting Princeton in the spring of 1934. Already at that time Church,\ntogether with his students Kleene and Rosser, had made substantial\nprogress in developing the formal system of function application and\nabstraction now known as the untyped lambda calculus. This\nsystem also provides a means of representing natural numbers as formal\nterms\u2014i.e., as so-called Church numerals. This leads to\na notion of a function being lambda-definable which is\nsimilar in form to (\\ref{repfun}). Church\u2019s definition thus also\ncharacterize a class \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) of lambda-definable functions\nwhich is similar in form to that of \\(\\mathbf{GR}\\). During this\nperiod, Kleene demonstrated that a wide range of number theoretic\nfunctions were included in \\(\\mathbf{L}\\), in part by showing how it\nis possible to implement primitive recursion in the lambda calculus.\nThis ultimately led Church to propose in early 1934 that the\nlambda-definable functions coincide with those possessing the property\nwhich he called \u201ceffective\n calculability\u201d.[16]\n\n\nA natural conjecture was thus that lambda-definability coincided\nextensionally with general recursiveness. Unlike (CT)\u2014which\nequates an informally characterized class of functions with one\npossessing a precise mathematical definition\u2014the statement\n\\(\\mathbf{GR} = \\mathbf{L}\\) potentially admits to formal\ndemonstration. Such a demonstration was given by Church (1936b; and in\ngreater detail by Kleene 1936b) providing the first of several\nextensional equivalence results which Kleene (1952, sec. 62) would\neventually cite as evidence of what he proposed to call\n\u201cChurch\u2019s Thesis\u201d.\n\nChurch\u2019s Thesis underlies contemporary computability theory in\nthe sense that it justifies the assumption that by studying\ncomputability relative to a single formalism (such as\n\\(\\mathbf{GR}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{L}\\)) we are thereby providing a\ngeneral account of which functions can and cannot be\neffectively computed in principle by an algorithm. In light of this,\nit will be useful to catalog some additional evidence for\nChurch\u2019s Thesis in the form of the equivalence of\n\\(\\mathbf{GR}\\) with several other computational formalisms presented\nin the Stanford Encyclopedia:\n\n\n\nLet \\(\\mathsf{T}\\) be a consistent, computably axiomatizable theory\nextending \\(\\mathsf{Q}\\) (i.e., Robinson arithmetic). Then the class\nof functions \\(\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathsf{T}}\\) which is representable in\n\\(\\mathsf{T}\\) in the sense of (\\ref{repfun}) above (with\n\\(\\mathsf{T}\\) replacing \\(\\mathsf{P}\\)) is such that\n\\(\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathsf{T}} = \\mathbf{GR}\\). (See\n representability in the entry on G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems\n and Odifreddi (1989, ch. I.3).)\n\n\nThe class \\(\\mathbf{REC}\\) consisting of the total functions which are\nmembers of the class of partial recursive functions (formed\nby closing the class \\(\\mathbf{PR}\\) under the unbounded minimization\noperation) is such that \\(\\mathbf{REC} = \\mathbf{GR}\\). (See\n Section 2.2.1\n and Odifreddi (1989, ch. I.2).)\n\n\nThe class \\(\\mathbf{CL}\\) of functions representable in\n Combinatory Logic\n (a formal system related to the lambda calculus) is such that\n\\(\\mathbf{CL} = \\mathbf{GR}\\). (See\n computable functions and arithmetic in the entry on combinatory logic\n and Bimb\u00f3 (2012, ch. 5.3).)\n\n\nThe class \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) of functions computable by a\n Turing machine\n (under several variants of its definition) is such that \\(\\mathbf{T}\n= \\mathbf{GR}\\). (See\n alternative historical models of computability in the entry on Turing machines\n and Odifreddi (1989, ch. I.4).)\n\n\nThe class \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) of functions computable by Unlimited\nRegister Machines introduced by Shepherdson & Sturgis (1963)\nis such that \\(\\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{GR}\\). (See Cutland (1980, ch.\n1\u20133) and Cooper (2004, ch. 2).)\n\n\nEquivalence results of these forms testify to the mathematical\nrobustness of the class \\(\\mathbf{GR}\\) and thereby also to that of\nthe informal notion of effective computability itself. As we have\nseen, G\u00f6del was originally led to the formulation of general\nrecursiveness by attempting to analyze the background notion of\nrecursive definition as a model of effective computation as inspired\nby the foundational developments of the late nineteenth and early\ntwentieth\n centuries.[17]\n Further discussion of how the work of Church, Turing, and Post can be\nseen as providing independently motivated analyses of computability\nwhich also support Church\u2019s Thesis can be found in Gandy (1980)\nand Sieg (1994, 1997, 2009).\n",
