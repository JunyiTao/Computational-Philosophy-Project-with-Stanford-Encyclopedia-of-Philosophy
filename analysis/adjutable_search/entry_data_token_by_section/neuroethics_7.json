    "main_text": "The ethics of neuroscience || Public perception of neuroscience\n2.6 Public perception of neuroscience\n\nThe advances of neuroscience have become a common topic in the popular\nmedia, with colorful brain images becoming a pervasive illustrative\ntrope in news stories about neuroscience. While no one doubts that\npopularizing neuroscience is a positive good, neuroethicists have been\nlegitimately worried about the possibilities for misinformation. These\ninclude worries about \u201cthe seductive allure\u201d of\nneuroscience, and of misleading and oversimplified media coverage of\ncomplex scientific questions.\n2.6.1 The seductive allure\n\nThere is a documented tendency for the layperson to think that\ninformation that makes reference to the brain, or to neuroscience or\nneurology, is more privileged, more objective, or more trustworthy\nthan information that makes reference to the mind or psychology. For\nexample, Weisberg and colleagues report that subjects with little or\nno neuroscience training rated bad explanations as better when they\nmade reference to the brain or incorporated neuroscientific\nterminology (Weisberg et al., 2008). This \u201cseductive allure of\nneuroscience\u201d is akin to an unwarranted epistemic deference to\nauthority. This differential appraisal extends into real-world\nsettings, with testimony from a neuroscientist or neurologist judged\nto be more credible than that of a psychologist. The tendency is to\nview neuroscience as a hard science, in contrast to \u201csoft\u201d\nmethods of inquiry that focus on function or behavior. With\nneuroimaging methods, this belies a deep misunderstanding of the\ngenesis and significance of the neuroscientific information. What\npeople fail to realize is that neuroimaging information is classified\nand interpreted by its ties to function, so (barring unusual\ncircumstances) it cannot be more reliable or \u201charder\u201d than\nthe psychology it relies upon.\n\nBrain images in particular have prompted worries that the colorful\nimages of brains with \u201chotspots\u201d that accompany media\ncoverage could themselves be misleading. If people intuitively\nappreciate brain images as if they were akin to a photograph of the\nbrain in action, that this could mislead them into thinking of these\nimages as objective representations of reality, prompting them to\noverlook the many inferential steps and nondemonstrative decisions\nthat underlie creation of the image they see (Roskies, 2007). The\nworry is that the powerful pull of the brain image will lend a study\nmore epistemic weight than is justified, and discourage people from\nasking the many complicated questions that one must ask in order to\nunderstand what the image signifies, and what can be inferred from the\ndata. Further work, however, has suggested that once one takes into\naccount the privilege accorded to neuroscience over psychology, the\nimages themselves do not further mislead (Schweitzer et al.,\n2011).\n2.6.2 Media Hype\n\nIn this era of indubitably exciting progress in brain research, there\nis a \u201cbrain-mania\u201d that is partially warranted but holds\nits own dangers. The culture of science is such that it is not\nuncommon for scientists to describe their work in the most dramatic\nterms possible in order to secure funding and/or fame. Although the\nhyperbole can be discounted by knowledgeable readers, those less\nsophisticated about the science may take it at face value. Studies\nhave shown that the media is rarely critical of the scientific\nfindings they report, and they tend not to present alternative\ninterpretations (Racine, 2006, 2015). The result is that the popular\nmedia conveys sometimes wildly inaccurate pictures of legitimate\nscientific discoveries, which can fuel both overly optimistic\nenthusiasm as well as fear. One of the clear pragmatic goals of\nneuroethics, whether it regards basic research or clinical treatments,\nis to exhort and educate scientists and the media to better convey\nboth the promise and complexities of scientific research. It is the\njob of both these groups to teach people enough about science in\ngeneral, and brain science in particular, that they see it as worthy\nof respect, and also of the same critical assessment that to which\nscientists themselves subject their own work.\n\nIt is admittedly difficult to accurately translate complicated\nscientific findings for the lay public, but it is essential.\nOverstatement of the significance of results can instill unwarranted\nhope in some cases, fear in others, and jadedness and suspicion going\nforward. Providing fodder for scientific naysayers has policy\nimplications that go far beyond the reach of neuroscience. Mistrust of\nscience is its own epidemic that needs to be inoculated against by\ncareful, early, and continuing education of the public. This is\nessential for the future status and funding of the basic sciences,\nand, as we have seen, for the health of democracy and our planet more\ngenerally.\n2.7 Neuroscience and justice\n\nSocial justice is a concern of ethics, and of neuroethics. Many of the\nethical questions are not new, but some have novel aspects. Bioethics\nalso has traditionally been concerned with issues of respect for\npatient\u2019s autonomy and right to self-determination. As mentioned\nabove, these questions take on added weight when the organ at issue is\nthe patient\u2019s brain, and questions about competence arise.\n\nEthical issues also attend doing neuroscientific research on\nnonhumans. Like traditional bioethics, neuroethics must address\nquestions about the ethical use of animals for experimental purposes\nin neuroscience. In addition, however, it ought to consider questions\nregarding the use of animals as model systems for understanding the\nhuman brain and human cognition (Johnson et al., 2020). Animal studies\nhave given us the bulk of our understanding of neural physiology and\nanatomy and have provided significant insight into function of\nconserved biological capacities. However, the further we push into\nunknown territory about higher cognitive functions, the more we will\nhave to attend to the specifics of similarities and differences\nbetween humans and other species and evaluating the model system may\ninvolve considerable philosophical work. In some cases, the\ndissimilarities may not warrant animal experiments.\n\nOther issues to which neuroethics also must be attentive to involve\nsocial justice. As neuroscience promises to offer treatments and\nenhancements, it must attend to issues of distributive justice, and\nplay a role in ensuring that the fruits of neuroscientific research do\nnot go only to those who enjoy the best our society has to offer.\nMoreover, a growing understanding that poverty and socioeconomic\nstatus more generally have long-lasting cognitive effects raises moral\nquestions about the social policy and the structure of our society,\nand the growing gap between rich and poor (Farah, 2017). It seems that\nthe social and neuroscientific realities may reveal the American Dream\nto be largely hollow, and these findings may undercut some popular\npolitical ideologies. There are also global issues to consider (Stein\nand Singh, 2020).\u00a0Justice may demand more involvement of\nneuroethicists in policy decisions.\n\nFinally, neuroethics stretches seamlessly into the law (see, e.g.\nVincent, 2013; Morse and Roskies, 2013; Jones et al., 2014).\nNeuroethical issues arise in criminal law, in particular with the\nissue of criminal responsibility (see, e.g. Birks & Douglas,\n2018). For example, the recognition that a large percentage of prison\ninmates have some history of head trauma or other abnormality raises\nthe question of where to draw the line between the bad and the mad.\nNeuroethics has bearing on issues of addiction and juvenile\nresponsibility, as well as on some other areas of law, such as in tort\nlaw, employment law, and health care law.\n3. The Neuroscience of Ethics\n\nNeuroscience, or more broadly the cognitive and neural sciences, have\nmade significant inroads into understanding the neural basis of\nethical thought and social behavior. In the last decades, these fields\nhave begun to flesh out the neural machinery underlying human\ncapacities for moral judgment, altruistic action, and the moral\nemotions (Liao, 2016). The field of social neuroscience, nonexistent\ntwo decades ago, is thriving, and our understanding of the circuitry,\nthe neurochemistry, and the modulatory influences underlying some of\nour most complex and nuanced interpersonal behaviors is growing\nrapidly. Neuroethics recognizes that the heightened understanding of\nthe biological bases of social and moral behaviors can itself have\neffects on how we conceptualize ourselves as social and moral agents,\nand foresees the importance of the interplay between our scientific\nconception of ourselves and our ethical views and theories (Roskies,\n2002). The interplay and its effects provide\u00a0reason to view the\nneuroscience of ethics (or more broadly, of sociality) as part of the\ndomain of neuroethics.\n\nPerhaps the most well-known and controversial example of such an\ninterplay marks the beginning of this kind of exploration. In 2001,\nJoshua Greene scanned people while they made a series of moral and\nnonmoral decisions in different scenarios, including dilemmas modeled\non the philosophical \u201cTrolley Problem\u201d (Thomson, 1985). He\nnoted systematic differences in the engagement of brain regions\nassociated with moral processing in \u201cpersonal\u201d as opposed\nto \u201cimpersonal\u201d moral dilemmas and hypothesized that\nemotional interference was behind the differential reaction times in\njudgments of permissibility in the footbridge case. In later work, he\nproposed a dual-process model of moral judgment, where relatively\nautomatic emotion-based reactions and high-level cognitive control\njointly determined responses to moral dilemmas, and he related his\nfindings to philosophical moral theories (Greene, 2004, 2008). Most\ncontroversially, he suggested that there are reasons to be suspicious\nof our deontological judgments, and interpreted his work as lending\ncredence to utilitarian theories (Greene 2013). Greene\u2019s work is\nthus a clear example of how neuroscience might affect our ethical\ntheorizing. Claims regarding the import of neuroscience studies for\nphilosophical questions have sparked a heated debate in philosophy and\nbeyond, and prompted critiques and replies from scholars both within\nand outside of philosophy (see, e.g. Berker, 2009; Kahane, 2011;\nChristensen, 2014). One effect of these exchanges is to highlight a\nproblematic tendency for scientists and some philosophers to think\nthey can draw normative conclusions from purely descriptive data;\nanother is to illuminate the ways in which descriptive data might\nitself masquerade as normative (Roskies, forthcoming).\n\nGreene\u2019s early studies demonstrated that neuroscience can be\nused in the service of examining extremely high-level behaviors and\ncapacities, and have served as an inspiration for numerous other\nexperiments investigating the neural basis of social and moral\nbehavior and competences (May et al., forthcoming). Neuroethics has\nalready turned its attention to phenomena such as altruism, empathy,\nwell-being, and theory of mind, as well as to disorders such as autism\nand psychopathy. The relevant works range from imaging studies using a\nvariety of imaging techniques, to manipulation of hormones and\nneurochemicals, to purely behavioral studies, and the use of virtual\nreality. In addition, interest in moral and social neuroscience has\ncollided synergistically with the growth of neuroeconomics, which has\nflourished in large part independently. A recent bibliography has\ncollected almost 400 references to works in the neuroscience of ethics\nsince 2002 (Darragh et al., 2015). We can safely assume that many more\nadvances will be made in the years to come, and that neuroethicists\nwill be called upon to advance, evaluate, expound upon, or deflate\nclaims for the purported ethical implications of our new\nknowledge.\n4. Looking forward: New neurotechnologies\n\nThe examples discussed above included pharmaceuticals that are already\napproved for use, existing brain imaging techniques and invasive\nneurotherapies. But practical neuroethical concerns, and some\ntheoretical concerns, are highly dependent upon the details of\ntechnologies. For example, adaptive DBS or aDBS, which \u201ccloses\nthe loop\u201d by concurrently stimulating and recording from neural\ntissue, and automatically adjusting stimulation based on the state of\nthe brain, raises more pressing and somewhat different concerns about\nagency and autonomy than does regular DBS (see, e.g. Goering et al.,\n2017). Several technologies are already on the horizon that are bound\nto raise some new neuroethical questions, or old questions in new\nguises. One of the most powerful new tools in the research\nneuroscientist\u2019s arsenal is \u201coptogenetics\u201d, a method\nof transfecting brain cells with genetically engineered proteins that\nmake the cell responsive to light of specific wavelengths (Diesseroth,\n2011). The cells can then be activated or silenced by shining light\nupon them, allowing for cell-specific external control. Optogenetics\nhas been successfully used in many model organisms, including rats,\nand work is underway to use optogenetics in monkeys. One may presume\nit is only a matter of time before it will be developed for use in\nhumans. The method promises to provide precise control of specific\nneural populations and relatively noninvasive targeted treatments for\ndiseases. It promises to raise the kind of neuroethical issues raised\nby many mechanisms that intervene on brain function: Questions of\nharm, of authenticity, and the prospect of brain cells being\ncontrolled by someone other than the agent himself (Gilbert, 2014;\nAdamczyk & Zawadzki, 2020). A second technique, CRISPR, allows\npowerful targeted gene editing. Although not strictly a\nneuroscientific technique, it can be used on neural cells to effect\nbrain changes at the genetic level (Canli, 2015). Genetic engineering\nmight make possible neural gene therapies and designer babies, making\nreal consequences of the genetic revolution thus far only\nimagined.\n\nThese and other technologies were not even imagined a few decades ago,\nand is likely that other future technologies will emerge which we\ncannot currently conceive of. If many neuroethical issues are closely\ntied to the capabilities of neurotechnologies, as I have argued, then\nwe will likely be unlikely to anticipate future technologies in enough\ndetail to predict the constellation of neuroethical issues that they\nmay give rise to. Neuroethics will have to grow as neuroscience does,\nadapting to novel ethical and technological challenges.",
