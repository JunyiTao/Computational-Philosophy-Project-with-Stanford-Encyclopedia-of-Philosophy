    "main_text": "War Crime Tribunals || Criticisms of war crime tribunals\n2.2 Criticisms of war crime tribunals\n The employment of war crime tribunals has always been\ncontroversial.  In what follows some of the central criticisms of such\ntrials are examined. We will focus on substantive rather than\ntechnical concerns.  \u201cTechnical concerns\u201d is understood as\nthe lack of resources, the reluctance of the international community\nto provide material assistance (in direct funds or in apprehension of\nsuspects), the ability of defendants to destroy evidence, the\ndeplorable condition of the legal class in war torn countries, and\nproblems of translation and common language. While these certainly are\nsignificant obstacles (as it was pointed out earlier, the operation of\nthe ICTY was almost undermined by such difficulties), they do not\nchallenge the rationale for using trials. The objections taken up\nhere, on the other hand, represent concerns that call into question\nthe coherence and fairness of the criminal courts as instruments of\npolitical transition.\n2.2.1 Victor's Justice\n\n\nAccording to some critics, post war tribunals, far from expressing a\ncommitment to the rule of law, are merely a charade in which winners\npunish losers for the damage and suffering the war brought about. This\nkind of cynicism about doing justice after war (and about the role of\njustice in politics more generally) has ancient roots. In his\nHistory of the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides (B.5 Ch.17)\nimagines one of the Athenian generals offering a sobering reality\ncheck to a Melian politician who does not understand why Athens must\nconquer his tiny, politically neutral island:\n we both alike know that in the discussion of human\naffairs the question of justice only enters where there is equal power\nto enforce it, and that the powerful exact what they can, and the weak\ngrant what they must.\n Hermann G\u00f6ring made a similar observation in a conversation with\nNuremberg's prison psychiatrist: \u201cthe victor will always be the\njudge, and the vanquished the accused\u201d (Bass 2002: 8).\n\n\nThe claim of victor's justice is difficult to\n dismiss.[15]\n After all, had the\nAllies lost the war, many of their senior military and political\nleaders would have gone on trial for the firebombing of Japanese and\nGerman cities. Curtis LeMay and Robert McNamara have publicly admitted\nas\n much.[16]\n And\nyet it is worthwhile noting, with Gary Bass, that there is a\ndistinction between the circumstances under which a tribunal is\ncreated and how decently and fairly it operates. In other words, a\ntribunal that was set up after victory in order to punish the side\nthat lost, might still either succeed or fail to follow fair\nprocedures. And in so far as this is true, the retribution of some\nvictors may be preferable to that of others. As Bass writes: \u201cit\nis victory that makes justice possible but the fairness of the process\nis what makes it justice\u201d (Bass 2002: 329). And, he adds, even\nthough we may be cynical about the fact that Americans are putting\nGermans on trial after they have defeated them, most of us, if given a\nhypothetical choice, would still prefer to be tried by an American\nrather than a Nazi court, because we assume it would be fairer (for a\nuseful series of essays on the Rwandan transition see Strauss and\nWaldorf 2011). Simply imagine the kind of charges the Nazis would\nbring against their defeated enemies: most likely, they would have not\nsufficed with indicting the allies for the firebombing of German and\nJapanese cities; they might also have charged then with protecting\nJews or with miscegenation, and perhaps punished them severely for\nthese charges.  While an indictment for firebombing would have been\nsubstantially sound, the latter accusations would have been based,\nexclusively, on the Nazis warped racial theories. In other words, some\nvictors' justice can be substantively flawed. Here, then, is the main\nadvantage of allied over Nazi victor's justice: the Americans and\ntheir partners prosecuted their defeated enemies for crimes that\nreally were crimes (for further discussions of victors' justice see\nMinow 1998; Chang and Barker 2001; Peskin 2005).\n2.2.2 Retroactivity\n\n\nA second important criticism of post war trials is that they hold\ndefendants responsible for acts that were not prohibited at the time\nthey were committed.\n\n\nMany of the Nazi defendants at Nuremberg argued that no existing laws\nor international standards banned their conduct during the war.\nConsequently, they argued, there can be no legal basis for prosecuting\nthem. Such claims are based on a fundamental precept of the rule of\nlaw: Nullum Crimen, Nulla Poena Sine Lege (no crime, no\npunishment without a legal prohibition). The main strategy used to\ncounter these arguments at Nuremberg was \u201cpositivistic\u201d:\nprosecutors strained to find sources in existing international law\nthat did forbid aggressive war, and then moved to associate many of\nthe other crimes for which the Nazis were accused with the waging of\nsuch war (Minow 1998: 33). A related difficulty arose when the\nprosecution looked for a legal doctrine that would allow them to\nconvict a large group of people for belonging to the Nazi war\nmachine. Here, too, a creative positivistic solution was found: One of\nStimson's aids, colonel Murray Bernays, devised the idea that the\nNazis would be tried as part of a criminal conspiracy. The advantage\nof such a strategy was that it required nothing more than the\nconviction of specific organizations of the charges (the SA, SS,\nGestapo among others) in order to hold all their members\nresponsible. As Bass puts it:\n once these organizations had been convicted, any\nmember of them could be swiftly punished: instead of proving\nindividual guilt\u2026 [prosecutors] would only have to provide that\nthe defendant had been a member of a criminal group activities. (Bass\n2002: 171; I am grateful to Thomas Pogge for this\npoint)\n The severity of the problem of retroactivity decreased after the\nNuremberg tribunal established the precedent that there was no need\nfor a highly specific prohibition in order to be held responsible\nbefore an international criminal court. And yet, the tribunals for\nYugoslavia and Rwanda still faced some problems of retroactivity when\nit came to deciding whether ethnic cleansing constituted genocide and\nwhat kind of intent was required for a genocide conviction (Minow\n1998: 34\u201335).\n While prosecutors in Nuremberg settled on a positivistic strategy\nfor countering the claims of retroactivity made by the defendants,\nanother possibility for rejecting such arguments should be mentioned.\nThis alternative is based in the \u201cnatural law\u201d tradition.\nOn this view, the response the Nazi defendants should have been given\nis, quite simply, that there are things that one does not do, or can\nexpect severe punishment for doing, whether they are explicitly\nforbidden or not. Whether such severe actions defy \u201cthe moral\nlaw\u201d to use the somewhat antiquated language of the classical\nnatural lawyers, or whether they simply offend fundamental\nsensibilities of any civilized human being, the upshot is the same: at\nthe extreme reaches of human behavior illegality does not necessarily\ndepend on a prior legal prohibition. It was this kind of argument that\nthe lead British prosecutor in Nuremberg, Hartley Shawcross, had in\nmind when he exclaimed in response to one of the iterations of the\nretroactivity complaint:\n I suppose the first person ever charged with murder\nmight have said: \u201cnow see here. You can't do that.  Murder\nhasn't been made a crime yet\u201d.  (Persico 1994:\n138)\n2.2.3 Selectivity\n A third important complaint against war crime tribunals maintains\nthat they frequently fail to indict all of those who were involved in\ncommitting atrocities. According to this charge, courts find it easier\nto prosecute lower level officials and military personnel, often\nleaving the more senior figures who devised the violent policies (but\ndo not have actual \u201cblood on their hands\u201d) untouched\n(Minow 1998: 40\u201341). To the extent that this complaint is well\nfounded it is devastating, as it suggests that war crime tribunals do\nnot result in a full or coherent exercise of retributive justice (for\na comprehensive account see Cryer 2005).  The principle of\n\u201cCommand Responsibility\u201d (CR) originally devised at\nNuremberg, and used extensively by the ICTY, has been employed, quite\neffectively, in order to counter complaints of selectivity. CR allows\nprosecutors to indict senior officials exclusively on the basis of\ntheir military or political leadership role (given the duties of\nsupervision and control attached to that role).\n\n\nThus, the ICTY has been able to convict Serbian officers for war\ncrimes because they did not prevent or curtail activities in which\ntheir troops were engaged. In an especially striking expansion of CR,\na Bosnian Croat regional commander, Tihomir Blaskic, was convicted by\nthe trial chamber of the ICTY of murder and other crimes against\nhumanity, for atrocities that took place in the village of\nAhmichi. The charges did not allege direct involvement or even turning\na blind eye to the activities of subordinates, but, rather, focused on\nBlaskic's failure to investigate after the massacre was brought to his\nattention. His unwillingness to look into the events was equated by\nthe court with responsibility for direct killing. In 2004 the appeals\nchamber of the ICTY rejected this interpretation of CR and overturned\nthe relevant part of the conviction.\n\n\nWhile CR can be instrumental for moving up the chain of command, it\nalso comes into conflict with the legalistic premise underlying war\ncrime tribunals. A criminal trial traditionally establishes individual\nresponsibility by presenting direct evidence against the defendant. CR\nallows conviction and punishment based on a philosophical construct\nrather than on the garnering of such evidence. The construct, roughly\nspeaking, is that certain roles come with built in accountability for\nthe actions of others, whether or not the individual who holds the\nrole was aware of these actions. Criminal law doctrine is, to say the\nleast, suspicious of such a separation between intent and culpability,\nespecially when it comes to very serious offenses (lesser offenses can\nbe established by proving the defendant was reckless or indifferent).\nThis tension points to a problem at the heart of international\ncriminal law: does the unique nature of mass atrocity, wherein\nnumerous people harm others with differing degrees of acquiescence and\ndirection from a large bureaucratic class, really lend itself to the\nlegalistic commitment to individualizing guilt on the basis of direct\nevidence? Or do the distinct features of such crimes require relaxing\nour standards of individual responsibility so as to implicate the\nentire state structure that made the atrocities\n possible?[17]\n If the latter, it\nmay be difficult to hold fast to the justification of such trials as\nexpressing a firm commitment to legalism and the idea of the rule\n of\nlaw.[18]\n\n\n\nOther significant (if less conceptually interesting) criticisms of the\ninternational criminal courts hold that they do not focus sufficiently\non the suffering of victims, concentrating, instead, on establishing\nthe guilt of\n perpetrators),[19]\n that the proceeding tend to become\ntechnical and tedious, thus trivializing the horrors\n being\ndiscussed,[20]\n\nthat there can be a discrepancy between the (Western) cultural norms\ncentral to legalism and the local traditions of the society in which\natrocities took\n place,[21]\n and that, in light of the repeated\noccurrence of genocide in the 20th century, the practice of\ninternational criminal law does not show great promise\n of\ndeterrence.[22]\nLeaders, such as Bashar al-Assad and Omar\nal-Bashir, who have the backing of major powers, have virtual\nimpunity. Of course it is important to prosecute former heads of\nstate, so as to demonstrate that political seniority is no guarantee\nof immunity from justice. The international tribunals serve a\npedagogical purpose, drawing attention to pertinent issues such as\nchild conscription.\n3. Truth Commissions\n3.1 Historical Background\n\n\nThe structural and political shortcomings of war crime trials, as\noutlined in the previous section, have led policy makers in war torn\ncountries to turn to other measures of transitional justice. The most\nimportant among these is the non-judicial truth commission.\n\n\nPriscilla Hayner (2002), in her landmark book on truth commissions,\nenumerates four characteristics typical of these bodies:\n\nThey deal with the past\nThey investigate continued patterns of abuses and not specific cases \nThey operate for up to two years and then submit reports\nsummarizing their findings and, \nThey are usually official bodies sanctioned by the state.\n\n These commissions, Hayner continues, most often have some or all\nof the following goals: unearthing, clarifying and formally\nacknowledging past abuses, responding to the needs of victims, helping\ncreate a culture of accountability, outlining institutional\nresponsibility and possible reforms, advancing the prospects of\nreconciliation and reducing conflict over the past (Hayner 2002:\n24).\n\n\nWhile truth commissions have fewer coercive powers than courts (they\ncannot compel governments to carry out their recommendations, they\nhave no authority to punish etc.), their mandate for investigating the\nbroader pattern of abuses, and their tendency to put the victims at\nthe center of their proceeding, gives these bodies a great degree of\nmoral credibility and legitimacy.\n\n\nThe work of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission\n(hereafter TRC) has sparked a great deal of interest in the use of\ntruth commissions after war. The celebrity of its chair, Desmond Tutu,\nthe massive scale of the public hearings it held, the intensive media\ncoverage, and its controversial amnesty-for-truth mechanism, generated\na great deal of international curiosity. Ever since the TRC completed\nits hearings and published its report, nations facing a transition to\ndemocracy have consistently asked themselves whether they too should\nuse truth commissions to confront past abuses. Some scholars even go\nso far as to say that the truth commission has now replaced criminal\nprosecution as the most important norm of international justice (see,\nfor example, Ben-Josef Hirsch 2007).\n\n\nWhile the TRC has become paradigmatic of truth commissions, it is\nworthwhile noting that it was not the first such body. Argentina,\nChile, and El Salvador all employed relatively effective truth\ncommissions during the 1980's and early\n 1990's.[23]\n\n\n\nThese efforts provided both inspiration and valuable lessons for the\ndesigners of the South African\n body.[24]\n\n\n\nIn Argentina, a truth commission was set up to investigate the abuses\ncommitted by the military junta during the country's \u201cdirty\nwar\u201d (1976\u20131983). It is estimated that up to 30,000\nsuspected \u201csubversives\u201d were\n\u201cdisappeared\u201d\u2014abducted, tortured and disposed of\nsecretly\u2014by security forces during those years. Unlike the South\nAfrican TRC, the Argentinean body, officially named \u201cNational\nCommission on the Disappearance of Persons\u201d, did not hold public\nhearings. The commission also lacked the authority and incentive\nstructure to compel cooperation from the military. And yet, it was\nable to produce a substantive report. More than 7000 statements were\ntaken, 1500 of which were given by survivors of military detention\ncamps. The commission focused on locating and exposing military\ndetention and torture centers. Much of the evidence it gathered was\nhanded over to prosecutors, eventually aiding in the convictions of\nseveral high-ranking officers. The truth commission's report, titled\nNever Again (Nunca M\u00e1s), was published in 1984 and\nhas become one of the best-selling books in Argentinean history.\n\n\nSeven years later, Chile's National Commission on Truth and\nReconciliation published a report documenting human rights abuses\ncommitted by the Chilean army during General Augusto Pinochet's\n17-year reign. As in Argentina, Chile's security forces practiced\nroutine torture, abductions and extrajudicial executions. The abuses\nwere especially severe in the first few years of the dictatorship. In\n1978 Pinochet issued a sweeping amnesty order, protecting all members\nof the security forces. This amnesty created a complex constitutional\nenvironment for the truth commission. The commission, chaired by\nformer senator Raul Retting, consisted of an equal number of Pinochet\nsupporters and critics. Its mandate was defined in relatively narrow\nterms, focusing on executions, disappearances and cases of torture\nthat resulted in death (leaving out a large number of torture\nsurvivors).  Like its Argentinean counterpart, the commission had no\nway to compel members of the security forces to testify. The\nCommissioners looked into 3400 cases and issued an 1800 page report in\nFebruary of 1991 strongly (and, significantly, unanimously) condemning\nPinochet and his generals. The impact of the report was weakened by a\nseries of armed attacks carried out by left leaning militants shortly\nafter its publication. In spite of the limited public attention it\nreceived at the time, the report was instrumental in creating a\nreparations program for the relatives of Pinochet's victims. The\ncommission's work was also useful in providing evidence to support the\nSpanish extradition request that eventually led to Pinochet's arrest\nin Britain. Pinochet was later returned to Chile, and died before he\ncould be convicted of any crimes.\n El Salvador's truth commission was probably the least successful\nof the three. The commission was created to investigate abuses carried\nout in the course of the civil war between government forces and FMLN\nguerrillas. According to some estimates, the 12-year war\n(1980\u20131992) claimed the lives of 75,000 citizens. As in\nArgentina and Chile, the military engaged in executions, torture, and\nabductions, in addition to large-scale massacres. The El Salvadorian\ncommission operated for 8 months. Appointed by the Secretary General\nof the United Nations, its members included former Colombian President\nBelisario Betancur, former President of the Inter American Court of\nHuman Rights Thomas Buergenthal, and former Minister of Foreign\nAffairs of Venezuela Reinaldo Figueredo Planchart. The animosity and\ndiffidence between the former combatants was such that no Salvadorians\nwere allowed to serve as commissioners.\n The commission gathered testimony on more than 7000 cases of\nsevere human rights violations. Its final report, titled \u201cFrom\nMadness to Hope\u201d, outlined a set of harsh conclusions against 40\ngovernment and military officials and stated that the vast majority of\natrocities had been committed by government backed security forces\n(rather than by FMLN fighters). Very shortly after the report's\npublication, a national amnesty law was passed, rendering many of the\ncommission's recommendations irrelevant. However, the report was\nhelpful in shaming and eventually removing from service some of the\nmilitary officials accused of especially egregious abuses.\n\n\nThree years after the release of El Salvador's report, On April 15,\n1996, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the head of South Africa's Anglican\nChurch, addressed a crowd gathered at East London's city hall. \n\nWe are charged to unearth the truth about our dark past,\n\n he told his listeners,\n and to lay the ghosts of that past to rest so that\nthey will not return to haunt us; and that we will thereby contribute\nto the healing of the traumatized and the wounded\u2014for all of us\nin South Africa are wounded people. (Meredith 1999:\n3)\n\n  Thus began South Africa's controversial experiment in transitional\n \n justice.[25]\n\n\n\nAs they debated how to manage the transition from apartheid,\nnegotiators on behalf of the African National Congress (hereafter ANC)\nand the outgoing National Party clashed repeatedly on the question of\nhow to address human rights abuses committed during the apartheid era.\nIn the negotiations leading up to the 1993 interim constitution, which\nlaid down the terms of the transition, the most contentious issue\nconcerned the question of amnesty. After a great deal of wrangling,\nthe two sides agreed to add a postamble to the constitution containing\nthe following language:\n in order to advance\u2026 reconciliation and\nreconstruction, amnesty shall be granted in respect of acts,\nomissions, and offenses associated with political objectives and\ncommitted in the course of the conflicts of the past.\u201d\n(Postamble to South Africa's Interim Constitution of 1993 as quoted in\nMeredith 1999: 20\u201321)\n Many ANC supporters, who wanted to see apartheid officials brought\nbefore Nuremberg style war crime tribunals, were understandably upset\nby the arrangement. Nelson Mandela, who insisted on the importance of\nsteering clear of \u201cvictors' justice\u201d, remained adamant\nabout the need for some kind of accountability for apartheid's\ncrimes. Without such reckoning, he threatened, the unaddressed\natrocities of the past would live with South Africans like a\n\u201cfestering sore\u201d (Meredith 1999: 18).\n The convergence between these two commitments\u2014to amnesty on\nthe one hand and to accountability on the other\u2014was to result in\nthe establishment of the TRC.\n\n\nThe process that led to the commission's creation was characterized by\nan unprecedented degree of transparency and public participation.\nDuring 1994, two major conferences were held to lay the groundwork for\nthe TRC's work. Both were organized by Alex Boraine, an Anti-Apartheid\nactivist who served as president of the South African Methodist\nChurch, MP for the progressive party, and the director of important\ncivil society NGOs. The first of these conferences focused on the\nlessons of political transitions in Latin America and Eastern Europe\n(Proceedings were published in Boraine et al. 1994).  The second\nsolicited input from stakeholders inside South Africa (Proceedings\nwere published in Boraine et al. 1995).  After the conferences, South\nAfrica's parliament began deliberating on the National Unity and\nReconciliation Act, which would set up the commission. The\nParliamentary Standing Committee on Justice held extended public\nhearings asking individuals, political parties and NGOs for their\nadvice on the design of the TRC. The law was finally passed, after a\ngreat deal of bickering and debate, in May of 1995, a year or so after\nit was first presented. The TRC thus became the first commission of\nits kind to be created through a parliamentary process rather than\nexecutive\n decree.[26]\n Whether by design or inertia, this open,\ndeliberative approach was also applied to the selection of commission\nmembers. Nominees were suggested by NGOs, churches, and political\nparties, and were then interviewed in public by the selection\ncommittee. Finally, the cabinet and president chose the commissioners\nfrom a short list.\n\n\nThe Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act set the\nfollowing three goals for the commission:\n to develop a complete picture of the gross violations\nof human rights that took place in and came through the conflicts of\nthe past; to restore to victims their human and civil dignity by\nletting them tell their stories and recommending how they could be\nassisted; and to consider granting amnesty to those perpetrators who\ncarried out their abuses for political reasons and who gave full\naccountings to their actions to the commission. (Graybill 2002:\n6).\n\n\nThe commission would respect the ANC's promise to offer amnesties, but\nthe reprieve would not be granted automatically. It would, rather, be\nlinked to a demand for full disclosure from perpetrators. Those\nseeking amnesty would have to apply for it, provide full details about\nwhat they had done, and establish that their activities were\npolitically motivated (rather than the result of greed,\n sadism\netc.).[27]\n\nApplicants would not, however, be required to apologize or otherwise\nexpress regret.  Furthermore, the arrangement would eliminate not only\ncriminal responsibility but also civil\n liability.[28]\n Successful\napplicants could be neither charged nor sued for their conduct during\nthe apartheid years. The commission would be charged with\ninvestigating abuses that took place between March 1, 1960 and May 10,\n1994.\n\n\nThe commission was divided into three committees in order to realize\nthe aims set out by the law: the committee on human rights violations,\nthe committee on amnesty, and the committee on reparation and\nrehabilitation. The first would collect testimony and conduct public\nhearings regarding the abuses. The second would consider applications\nfor amnesty from members of the security forces and ANC, and determine\nwhether the acts in question were committed in a political context and\nwhether applicants had provided full disclosure about them. The third\nwould come up with recommendations and criteria for whom to compensate\nand how.\n\n\nThe TRC's authority and resources were unprecedented in the history of\ntruth commissions. It had the power to subpoena witnesses and the\nauthority to order searches and seizures. It had a witness protection\nprogram, 300 staff members, and an annual budget of 18 million\ndollars.  Its proceedings were broadcast on a daily basis on both\nradio and television, and were widely covered by the printed\npress. During the course of its tenure, the commission took testimony\nfrom more than 22,000 victims and witnesses, hearing upwards of 2,000\nof them in public.\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, the main controversy surrounding the commission's work\nconcerned its amnesty-granting powers. The opportunity afforded to\nperpetrators of egregious human rights abuses to walk away from\nprosecution enraged many black South Africans who wanted to see those\nwho had tormented them and their families put behind bars. As far as\nmany blacks were concerned, the TRC allowed some of apartheid's worst\noffenders to \u201cget away with\n murder.\u201d[29]\n As Martin Meredith\n(1999: 315) puts it in his superb survey of the commission's\ntenure:\n \u2026the work of the TRC provoked\u2026anger in\nparts of the black community\u2026particularly over the way security\nforce operatives responsible for heinous crimes were given freedom in\nexchange for a bit of truth telling, while victims and their families\nwere denied access to the courts. What many wanted more than truth was\njustice\u2014prosecution in the courts and prison\nsentences.\n\n Many academic observers of South Africa's transition were dismayed as\n well, remarking that neither political necessity nor the attempt to\n create social solidarity can justify the kind of sacrifices of\n retributive justice the TRC's work entailed.\n\n\nThe outrage is more than understandable, when one considers cases like\nthat of Vlakplass commander Dirk Coetzee who testified to killing ANC\nactivist Sizwe Kondile and burning his body on an open bonfire.\nCoetzee and his men stood by, drinking beers and smoking for more than\nseven hours, until nothing remained of Kondile. The sight of such a\nman walking away from his testimony cannot but turn one's stomach.\n The international community has continued to experiment with truth\ncommissions as a means to achieve transitional justice. On July 13,\n2001, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor\n(UNTAET) established the Commission for Reception, Truth, and\nReconciliation (CRTR). The purpose of this commission is to promote\n\u201cnational reconciliation and healing\u201d after decades of\npolitical conflict following the 1975 invasion and subsequent\noccupation of East Timor by Indonesia.\n\n\nFollowing a failed attempt to annex East Timor in 1999,\nIndonesia-supported militants are suspected of killing over 1,000\nsupporters of an independent East Timor and caused hundreds of\nthousands of civilians to flee their homes (Stahn 2001).\n\n\nIn 2011, Brazil also created a truth commission to investigate and\npublicize human rights abuses that occurred during the rule of\nBrazil's military dictatorship from 1964\u20131985. The seven-person\ncommission was provided with a two-year mandate to investigate human\nrights abuses and to compile a file report to be released publicly.\nHowever, doubts regarding the truth commission remain as a result of a\n1979 law that provided amnesty to many of those responsible for crimes\ncommitted during the military regime's\n rule.[30]\n\n Much of the scholarly literature on the TRC in South Africa\ncenters on the question of justification, on the attempt to locate a\nrationale which might make sense of an arrangement that goes against a\ngreat deal of our untrained intuitions about justice. \u201cIf\njustice requires the prosecution and punishment of those who commit\ngross human rights violations\u201d, writes Elizabeth Kiss (2000:\n68), \u201cthen the amnesty offered by the TRC violates justice. Can\nthe TRC be defended against, or in spite of, this criticism?\u201d\nSimilarly, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson (2000: 22) point out\nthat:\n In a democratic society, and especially in a society\nthat is trying to overcome injustices of the past, trading criminal\njustice for a general social benefit such as social reconciliation\nrequires a moral defense if it is to be defensible. \n\nKent Greenwalt (2000: 191) echoes the same concern when he reminds us\nthat,\n those who decide whether to include amnesty as an\nadjunct to a truth commission must face two basic issues. Does\ngranting amnesty to murderers and torturers involve doing injustice?\nWhat might justify the state's doing such an\ninjustice?\n\n\nIn what follows, we offer a critical survey of some of the most\nimportant philosophical justifications of the TRC. The discussion\napplies to any truth commission with comparable powers (this\ndiscussion is based on Eisikovits 2004, 2006).\n3.2 Justifying Truth Commissions\n3.2.1 Deliberative democracy\n\n\nGutmann and Thompson (2000) argue that a justification of a truth\ncommission needs to meet three criteria relevant for the justification\nof all democratic institutions: it must be moral in principle,\ninclusive, and moral in practice. The first condition rules out what\nthe authors call the realist justification\u2014the claim\nthat the compromise embodied in the TRC was necessary in order to\navoid a civil war. The second demands that the justification employ\nreasons that are \u201cbroadly accessible and therefore inclusive of\nas many people as possible\u201d (2000: 23). The last requires that\nthe justification be based on reasons that \u201care to the extent\npossible embodied or exemplified by the commission's own\nproceedings\u201d (2000: 23). The justification that most fully meets\nthese three requirements, argue the authors, is one rooted in the\nconcepts of deliberative democracy and reciprocity. Central to\ndeliberative democracy is\n the idea that citizens and officials must justify any\ndemands for collective action by giving reasons that can be accepted\nby those who are bound by the action\u2026. (2000:\n35\u201336)\n\n  This, in turn, presupposes the notion of reciprocity\n which asks citizens to try to justify their political\nviews to one another, and to treat with respect those who\nmake\u2026efforts to engage in this mutual enterprise even when they\ncannot resolve their disagreements\u201d (2000: 36).\n\n\nTo the extent that a truth commission promotes such reciprocal\nexchanges it is morally justifiable, because such an exchange is, in\nitself, a moral good. The first condition is thus met. A commission\nbased in a conception of deliberative democracy is also inclusive\nsince the principle of reciprocity involves appeals to reasons that\nmake sense to a large number of participants in the political\nprocess:\n the standard of reciprocity also satisfies the second\nrequirement of justification by providing an inclusive perspective. A\nreciprocal perspective is one that cannot be reasonably rejected by\nany citizen committed to democracy because it requires only that each\nperson seek terms of cooperation that respect all as free and equal\ncitizens. (2000: 37)\n\n Finally, a commission committed to the principle of reciprocity is\n likely to function in a way that embodies that principle.\n Such a commission practices what it preaches about the\ndemocratic society that it is trying to help create. Reciprocity\nserves as a guide\u2026 for the commission itself, calling on the\ncommissioners and the testifiers to practice some of the skills and\nthe virtues of the democratic society they are striving to\ncreate\u2026 the openly participatory process by which members and\nstaff of the TRC were appointed, and the generally public process in\nwhich its proceedings were conducted, demonstrated its own commitment\nto democratic practices. (2000: 37)\n Reciprocity, argue the authors, implies another\ncommitment\u2014to \u201cthe economy of moral disagreement.\u201d\nCitizens must justify their positions by using the least controversial\nrationale available.  The principle of economy encourages those\nengaged in deliberation to look for justifying reasons that overlap\nwith rather than contradict beliefs held by others. To be morally\njustifiable under a conception of deliberative democracy, a truth\ncommission needs to economize on disagreement. An example of\neconomizing in the work of South Africa's TRC is the decision not to\ngrant blanket amnesties and to insist on the indictment of some of the\nworst perpetrators.\n\n\nThe proposed justification presents several difficulties. First, it\nassumes that a justification of truth commissions must meet the same\ndemands that justifications of existing democratic institutions need\nto satisfy. But a truth commission is not a democratic institution.\nRather, it is an institution that is meant to facilitate the\ntransition of a society to democracy. More often than not, countries\nundergoing such transitions lack a democratic tradition, have no\nhistory of significant public dialogue, and have not secured the\nminimal economic conditions required for meaningful political\nparticipation. Under these circumstances, expecting truth commissions\nto reflect and promote the ideals of deliberative democracy might be\ntoo ambitious.\n\n\nSecond, the justification is not specific enough. It is not clear why\ndeliberative democracy, and its accompanying attributes of reciprocity\nand minimizing disagreement, justify truth commissions any more than\nother transitional instruments. Thus, for example, a war crimes\ntribunal may generate as much public discussion as a truth commission,\nit may be based on reasons or principles as widely accessible as those\nunderlying a truth commission, and it may insist on trying only the\nworst offenders, thus economizing on moral disagreements. It seems, in\nother words, that the deliberative democracy-based argument justifies\nmore than one transitional policy.\n\n\nFinally, it is questionable whether the TRC can be justified through a\ndeliberative democracy rationale at all. The commission did not embody\na particularly open, deliberative stance in its operation.  Though\nmany of its hearings were public, some of the important procedures\nassociated with them were confidential by default. Thus, for example,\nthe proceedings of the amnesty commission were public, but the amnesty\napplications themselves, as well as the supporting documentation,\nremained confidential until declassified by the\ncommission. Furthermore, the commission was exempt from standard rules\nof legal procedure and evidence. Perpetrators named in the testimony\nof victims, or in the testimony of other perpetrators, were not given\nan opportunity to defend themselves; second-hand information, which a\ntraditional court would have disqualified as hearsay, was admitted,\netc. Now a commission making these sorts of exceptions to the precepts\nof procedural justice can still be justified (for example by showing\nthat these exceptions were necessary for establishing the chain of\nresponsibility leading to the higher ranks of government). But it is\ndoubtful whether the best way to justify it is by invoking a\nconception of deliberative democracy. For public deliberation to be\nmeaningful and substantial, strong protections of procedural justice\nmust be in place.  As mentioned previously, these were lacking in the\ncase of the TRC.\n3.2.2 Justice as Recognition\n\n\nA second justification holds that truth commissions, by focusing on\nvictims and providing them with the opportunity to tell their stories\nto a sympathetic forum, recognize victims as moral agents with stories\nworth telling. As Kiss (2000: 73) puts it,\n providing a platform for victims is one of the core\ntasks of truth commissions, not merely as a way of obtaining\ninformation but also from the standpoint of justice\u2026Those whose\nlives were shattered are entitled to have their suffering acknowledged\nand their dignity affirmed, to know that their \u201cpain is real and\nworthy of attention\u201d\u2026 We affirm the dignity and agency of\nthose who have been brutalized by attending to their voices and making\ntheir stories a part of the historical record.\n\n\nThe TRC did not adhere to the strict, skeptical approach to witnesses\nprevalent in law courts. Standard laws of evidence were\nrelaxed. Commissioners offered unusual gestures of acknowledgement\nsuch as rising when the witnesses entered the courtroom, visiting the\nsites of atrocities, and participating in public reburials (for more\ndetail see Kiss 2000: 73).  These practices were aimed at making the\nprocess about the victims of apartheid; witnesses were\nassumed to be speaking the truth, and were treated as people with\nvaluable tales to tell and lessons to teach.\n The justification of the TRC sketched above is a powerful one. A\ntransition from mass atrocity into civil society, if it is to be\nstable and lasting, requires that the value of the individual lives of\nan entire class\u2014the class of victims\u2014be affirmed. By\nallowing victims to testify in an uninterrupted manner, and by\ncreating a setting in which their testimonies were presumed to be\ntrue, the hearings of the TRC in South Africa went beyond establishing\nthe crimes of the security forces, or presenting the hardships of\neveryday life under apartheid. They also posited blacks, for the first\ntime, as persons whose stories ought to be heard with care and\nrespect. In other words, not only the content of the testimonies\nbefore the TRC was of significance; the mere act of blacks testifying\nwas transformative as well. The class of whites, the majority of whom\nhad supposed that a black man or woman cannot be the bearer of\nlegitimate, significant information, was made to think again.\n\n\nHowever, the argument from recognition raises a serious difficulty.\nSome victims argued that the restoration of their dignity requires\nthat those who hurt them be punished; that in order to feel worthy of\nrespect, they must know their injuries merit the criminal law's\nprotection. For such victims, dignity is manifested not by the\ncapacity to testify, but primarily by the commitment of the state to\napply its coercive power on their behalf. For some of us, in other\nwords, the currency of recognition is punishment rather than\nstorytelling; being recognized as a human being again can consist,\nfirst and foremost, in knowing that one is part of a civic zone\nprotected by law, where the use of violence against her is met with\nstrict sanctions. Under this understanding, the newfound capacity to\ntestify, even if combined with promises of future protection by the\nlaw, simply does not cut it.\n3.2.3 More truth\n Some defenders of truth commissions claim that these bodies are\nbetter than trials at producing comprehensive accounts of past abuses.\nThis superiority, they say, justifies compromises in retributive\njustice. In the case of the TRC, it was not only the dismissal of\nregular rules of evidence that allowed commissioners to unearth more\ninformation. The commission's amnesty-for-truth mechanism created an\nincentive for perpetrators to come forward. Once they started to do\nso, a domino effect resulted: offenders who were exposed in the\ntestimony of their colleagues rushed to testify lest they be indicted.\nFurthermore, since the commission was authorized to deny amnesty to\nanyone who had not provided \u201cfull disclosure\u201d, those who\ncame before it tried to give as much detail as they could.\n The \u201cmore truth\u201d justification is a strong one. Two\nobservations are, however, in order. First, as some critics of the TRC\nhave noted, its choice to focus on gross human rights\nviolations\u2014on dramatic stories of suffering, has obscured some\nof the institutional aspects of apartheid. Thus, the interconnections\nbetween business and the security forces, the wildly discriminatory\npractices of many work places and the support that many white media\noutlets lent authorities in masking the practices of apartheid were\nlargely overlooked by the commission's work. Insofar as these, too,\nare aspects of the truth, they were not revealed by the TRC.\n\n\nSecond, the fact that the TRC was the result of a political compromise\nmeant that there were some areas in which it treaded carefully. Some\nworm cans remained closed. In a recent book on the history of\napartheid, Terry Bell (2003: 4) mentions one remarkable example: as\nFredrick de Klerk, South Africa's last white leader, was heading for\nOslo to receive the Nobel peace prize in 1993, he ordered a strike on\na house allegedly housing militants from the Pan African Congress\nliberation group. A police death squad ended up killing five teenagers\nsleeping in a private home in the town of Umtata. The incident was\nnever investigated by the TRC.\n3.2.4 Forgiveness\n\n\nIt has become fashionable of late to speak about the importance of\nforgiveness in politics. Forgiveness is said to be the only\ndisposition that allows us to break free of the endless cycle of blow\nand counter blow characteristic of ethnic conflict. We are told that\nforgiving is our only chance to put to rest a tortured, complicated\nhistory of assaults and recriminations. One celebrated practitioner of\npolitical forgiveness, the Archbishop Desmond Tutu, called his book on\nSouth Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission No Future\nwithout Forgiveness. As the title suggests, Tutu argues that it\nis only by forgoing resentment and learning to forgive each other that\nSouth Africans could ever create a viable democracy. Can the prospects\nand benefits of forgiveness justify the tradeoff between truth and\n(retributive) justice involved in the TRC's\n work?[31]\n\n The most prevalent argument in favor of political forgiveness\nconcerns its potential to release victims and wrongdoers from the\neffects of vindictiveness. A desire for revenge can generate a\nnever-ending violent cycle, trapping both sides in a dynamic of blow\nand response, eventually destroying all those involved. As Gandhi\nfamously put it, \u201can eye for an eye can make the whole world\nblind.\u201d\n But forgiveness is not the only way to quell the desire for\nrevenge.  We can steer clear of revenge without forgiving. Victims\nmight seek legal rather than private justice. They might agree to\ninstitutionalize their vindictive passions through the use of the\ncourts. As Martha Minow (1998: 11) puts it, it is possible \u201cto\ntransfer the responsibilities for apportioning blame and punishment\nfrom victims to public bodies acting according to the rule of\nlaw.\u201d This is, in essence, the rationale behind the attempts to\nexpand the authority and centrality of the international criminal\ncourts in recent decades.\n\n\nVictims can (and very often do) simply move away from the scene of the\ntrauma rather than seek revenge or engage in forgiveness. In recent\nyears there has been a quiet exodus of approximately 100,000\nPalestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, to Europe and North\nAmerica. Most Holocaust survivors, uninterested in revenge or\nforgiveness, simply moved thousands of miles away from the sites of\ntheir horrific memories and swore never to set foot in the countries\nthat had persecuted them. Others replace revenge with commemoration,\ndedicating themselves to the creation and maintenance of monuments and\nmuseums. Thus, for example, many of those handing out the ID cards at\nthe Holocaust Museum in Washington D.C. are holocaust survivors, as\nare many of the guides in Jerusalem's Yad Vashem memorial.\n\n\nThe basic point, to reiterate, is this: vengeance can, indeed, be a\nvery dangerous thing. But one does not have to advocate forgiveness in\norder to avoid it. There are other ways to combat it, ways that might\nbe free of some of the complications (more on this below) associated\nwith forgiveness.\n\n\nMany commentators assume that forgiving is the exclusive prerogative\nof victims. On this view, it is problematic to define a process of\npolitical reconciliation in terms of forgiveness, because forgiving is\na very private business that cannot be promoted as a policy. While\nthis position is intuitively powerful, we will take a somewhat more\nnuanced stance. Let us call it the \u201cfading prerogative\u201d\nview: While forgiving is not exclusively up to victims, it certainly\nmakes less sense to talk about forgiveness the further away we move\nfrom the partly directly injured. If X gets hurt in a bus\nbombing, she might forgive the person who planned the attack. It can\nmake sense for her parents to forgive him too, though it is not\nobvious that they would be forgiving the same thing (the nature of the\nparents' injury is different from X's: the extent of her\nphysical pain was greater than theirs; the degree of their emotional\nanguish might have well been higher than hers). It would be more\nproblematic to speak of X's neighbors forgiving the bus bomber\nfor X's injuries, and even more problematic to speak of people\nwhom X has never met forgiving the bomber. Forgiveness, then,\nmight not be the exclusive prerogative of victims, but the entitlement\nto grant it certainly seems to fade as we move away from them. There\nis, in other words, a limited radius in which it makes sense to speak\nof forgiveness. This does not, of course, mean that we cannot think of\npolitical reconciliation in terms of forgiveness. It only means that\nsuch an approach would exclude a (potentially) significant part of the\ncommunity from the process.\n\n\nThere are other difficulties with making forgiveness into a political\ngoal. A policy encouraging victims to forgive those who have harmed\nthem risks adding insult to their injuries; it can induce a sense of\nmoral inadequacy on top of the devastation already suffered. A\nvictim's reaction to such a policy might run something like this:\n isn't it enough that I had to go through all this? Now\nyou are expecting me to forgive the person who did it? Now you are\nplacing the moral burden on me?\n Such a reaction suggests that demands for forgiveness might\nexacerbate rather than quell resentment\u2014both towards the\noffender, to whom the victim does not want to owe a moral debt, and\ntowards the state that makes such demands. Ironically, then, a policy\nadvocating forgiveness might undermine one of its own aims\u2014the\nreduction of vindictive and resentful passions after conflict.\n Finally, it is worth remembering that forgiveness is a deeply\nChristian notion. As J.G. Williams puts it: \u201cforgiveness is at\nthe religious, theological and ethical core of the Christian\ntradition\u201d (Rye et al. 2000: 31). The term does have an\nimportant role in both Judaism and Islam, but its status in these\nfaiths is more ambivalent. Thus, for example, while Judaism does,\nunder some conditions, impose a duty to forgive, it is not clear\nwhether this duty must be exercised towards non-Jews. Furthermore,\nJudaism, unlike Christianity, discourages unconditional\nforgiveness. Islamic doctrine does state that forgiveness is superior\nto revenge, but permits retributive practices, and even feuding under\nsome circumstances.  Unlike the famous Christian teaching encouraging\nthe turning of the other cheek, the Koran recommends a middle way\nbetween absolute vindictiveness and absolute forgiving. It reads:\n let harm be requited by an equal harm, though anyone\nwho forgives and puts things right will have his reward from God\nHimself--He does not like those who do wrong. (al-Shura 42:40)\n(Haleem, M., 2004))\n\n The Koran also makes a division between forgivable and unforgivable\n sins, mentioning the trespass of shirk\u2014the recognition\n of divinities other than Allah\u2014as a prime example of the latter\n category.  Finally, both Judaism and Islam allow for forgiveness\n without the resumption of relations between victim and offender,\n while Christianity insists that the possibility of full restoration\n of previous relations be left open.\n\n\nSince the demands and centrality of forgiveness vary between the\ndifferent faiths, it might be problematic to include the term as part\nof our notion of political reconciliation, especially in cases of\ninter-religious conflict. Even if the employment of the term were not\noffensive to anyone, it is likely that different religious parties\nwould be speaking of different things when they refer to forgiveness.\nThis, it strikes me, can create more confusion than benefit.\n4. Lustration\n4.1 Historical Background\nLustration is the process of regulating how former government\nofficials can participate in post-conflict government and social\nstructures. In particular, lustration involves the screening, barring,\nand removal of public officials from public positions in the new\ndemocratic system as a form of administrative justice.\nThe concept is based on the ancient Roman lustrum rituals, a\ncleansing or purification of an individual or community through the\nremoval of pollution. Lustration is often associated with the\ntransition from an authoritarian regime to democratic governance, and\nin particular with both the denazification of post-WWII Germany and\nthe post-communist transition to democracy in Eastern Europe following\nthe collapse of the Soviet Union. Lustration was originally\nimplemented as a part of the administrative reforms imposed by the\nAllies in post-WWII Germany and Japan, and by states in Western Europe\nthat were formerly occupied by the Nazi regime.\nFollowing the end of WWII, the Allies assigned themselves the task\nof purging all traces of Nazism from both German government and\nsociety, the first large-scale attempt at lustration in the modern\nera.  The Big Three Allies (the Soviet Union, United Kingdom, and\nUnited States) agreed on a plan of action to denazify Germany at the\nTripartite Conference in Potsdam. The Potsdam Agreement, released on\nAugust 2, 1945, set the groundwork for Allied efforts at purging\nNazism and its adherents from Germany. The Potsdam Agreement required\nthe Control Council (comprised of the four Allied Military Governors\nin occupied Germany) to\n\n destroy the National Socialist Party and its\naffiliated and supervised organizations, to dissolve all Nazi\ninstitutions, to ensure that they are not revived in any form, and to\nprevent all Nazi and military activity or\npropaganda. (II.A.3.iii)\n\n Furthermore, the subsequent Control Council Law No. 2 declared that\n the Nazi Party and all affiliates, totaling more than 60 specific\n organizations, were to be dismantled and outlawed.\nThe process of denazification, however, was not limited to the\ndestruction of Nazi organizations. The Potsdam Agreement also\nabolished all police organizations that monitored and controlled\npolitical activity for the Nazi Party and revoked all Nazi-era\nlegislation that established legally sanctioned \u201cdiscrimination\non the grounds of race, creed, or political opinion\u201d\n(II.A.4).\nOne of the most ambitious and wide-scale activities of the Control\nCouncil was the arrest of those involved with the National Socialist\nParty and its affiliates, and those who actively supported Nazism\nduring the war. The Allied arrest programs called for the automatic\ndetention of anyone associated with the Nazi police and security\nservices, officers holding the rank of major or higher in select\nbranches of the armed forces, high-ranking members of the Nazi Party,\nand high ranking members of the German\n government.[32]\n\nControversially, the Potsdam Agreement also called for the removal\nof Nazis from both \u201cpublic and semi-public office, and from\npositions of responsibility in important private undertakings\u201d\n(II.A.6). Although this policy was both harsh and ambitious, it meshed\nwith the Allied goal of both destroying the National Socialist Party\nand ensuring that it is \u201cnot revived in any form\u201d\n(II.A.3.iii). The process of denazification also included the\nconfiscation of all wealth and property associated with Nazi\norganizations and high-ranking Nazi officials, and a complete purging\nof the educational system of all Nazis, Nazi materials, and\nobjectionable courses. The Allied military government also prohibited\nthe display of Nazi \u201cuniforms and insignia, salutes, medals,\nanthems, and music\u201d (Plischke 1947), a policy that remained in\nforce even after political control was returned to the Germans.\nDespite the enormous amount of resources and energy devoted to the\ndenazification of Germany, there were several problems associated with\nthe process. One of the biggest impediments to the complete\ndenazification of post-WWII Germany was the lack of qualified\nanti-Nazis to staff the government, and in particular the court system\nresponsible for trying ex-Nazis. The shortage of qualified\nprofessionals with \u201cclean records\u201d, combined with\ninterference from German officials and indifference from American\nofficers, led to disappointment among many of those tasked with\nensuring the complete removal of Nazism and its adherents from\n German\ngovernment.[33]\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union and their emergence as\nindependent nation-states, the states that made up the former\nCzechoslovakia practiced lustration as a method of transitional\njustice. In 1991, the Czech and Slovak National Assembly passed a law\nprohibiting former Communist Party officials, members of the People's\nMilitia, and members of the National Security Corps from holding a\nwide range of elected and civil service positions in the new\ngovernment for five years (until January 30,\n 1996);[34]\n the ban was later\nextended an additional five years. \n In Hungary, a 1991 law attempted to reset the stature of\nlimitations on crimes committed during the period of Communist rule\n(1944\u20131990).  Hungary's Constitutional Court overturned this\nlaw. The Court later approved an amended bill, which labeled the\nrepression of 1956 as \u201cwar crimes\u201d and \u201ccrimes\nagainst humanity\u201d, both of which carry no finite statute of\nlimitations. On 9 March 1994, during the immediate run-up to national\nelections, the Hungarian Parliament passed a lustration ordinance that\nplaced roughly 12,000 \u201cofficials\u201d under review in an\nattempt to discover who among them had collaborated with the secret\npolice during the Communist period. This list contained\nParliamentarians, high-ranking government officials, top officials at\nthe Hungarian National bank, ambassadors, generals, top media\noperatives, police, university officials and professors, judges, state\nattorneys, editors, directors of state agencies and banks, and\nadministrators of other sundry financial and governmental institutions\n(Ellis 1996).\n\n\nTwo panels were charged with screening suspects by investigating their\nsecret files. The investigative period was to last six years and\nresults will remain secret for thirty years. Several elements of this\nlaw were found unconstitutional in March 1994, and the Parliament\npassed a new law on July 3, 1996, which provides for the screening of\nall individuals born prior to 14 February 1972 before the assumption\nof higher office. Former agents and officials of the internal security\nservices were the target. If the lustrated official did not resign\nwithin thirty days, the results of the investigation would be released\npublicly, bringing public humiliation into play as a tool of\nlustration.\n\n\nThe demise of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) in 1990, and\nits annexation by West Germany, resulted in its\n\u201ccolonization\u201d by administrators, bureaucrats, and jurists\nfrom West Germany. This was partly due to the manner in which\nre-unification took place (de facto annexation), but was also\nthe result of the complete inadequacy of the existing East German\ncivil service in the face of the new demands of a capitalist\nsociety. This \u201ccolonization\u201d and the imposition of the\npolitical and legal judgment of another country, a former foe, sets\nthe East German lustration apart from other such processes in\npost-Socialist Europe.\n It was necessary to supply the new West German government with\nmoral and political legitimacy in the former states of East\nGermany. This demanded the prosecution of past crimes under the prior\nregime, but also a purge of Communists and Stasi collaborators from\nthe civil service. No post-Communist country has yet devised a\nlustration scheme with the golden balance addressing these two\ncompeting needs. East Germany was no exception, despite\u2014or\nperhaps because of\u2014the rigor with which lustration was\npursued.\n\n\nThe ambiguities in the definition of collaboration (in cases of\ncollaboration, forced collaboration, pseudo-compliance, clandestine\nresistance, etc.) resulted in similar difficulties in the lustration\npurge, whose terms were defined in the EinigVrt (the Treaty of\nUnification) (Blankenburg 1995). West German civil servants and\nlawyers largely conducted the purge and the construction of new\ninstitutions in East Germany. East German lawyers were both unfamiliar\nwith the new legal system and suspect in the eyes of the new\nauthorities. The non-indigenous nature of the process was a major\nproblem both in fact and public perception. The scope of the\nlustration and the system's ability to delineate individual\nresponsibility for the Communist regime's repression were both\ncriticized (Blankenburg 1995).\n The Treaty of Unification dealt with the union of both legal and\npolitical systems. Public employees would be scrutinized to determine\nif they were politically and ideologically fit for\nreemployment. Forced to reapply for their positions, public employees\nfaced rejection if Stasi or other untoward associations were\ndiscovered. They also faced criminal trial if their offenses were\ndeemed prosecutable by the reconstituted court system. Most trials\nwere therefore conducted by new West German\u2014or more rarely,\npre-screened East German\u2014judges under East German criminal\nlaw. These trials were meant to bring public humiliation to the\nconvicted.\n\n\nThe former leadership of the DDR was tried in courts in West Berlin.\nAreas of investigation by the new authorities included: commanders\nresponsible for the DDR's border policy (\u201cshoot to kill\u201d),\nelection fraud at various levels of governance, and charges of\ncorruption, embezzlement, and \u201cmisuse of public funds\u201d\n(Blankenburg 1995). The prosecution took on a hybrid form: the\nsuspects had to be tried according to the criminal law of East Germany\n(which West German jurists considered an Unrechtsstaat) but\nwith the procedures of West German courts. The intent was to\ncriminalize the Communist regime by treating and prosecuting its\nleadership according to the rules of an ordinary West German criminal\ntrial.\n In the aftermath of the Iraq War of 2003, the Bush administration\npursued a policy of \u201cde-Baathification\u201d as a means of\npurging the government of Saddam supporters and collaborators. In\ncontrast to previous lustration efforts following WWII and the\ncollapse of the Soviet Union, the U.S. government initially indicated\nthat a large number of bureaucrats and officials would be retained in\nthe post-Saddam government (de Young and Slevin 2003).  However, the\nscope of the United States' de-Baathification efforts would soon\nexpand well beyond that initially limited scope\n\n\nThe U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) ultimately required\na governmental purge of all Baath party members, although there were\nexemptions provided to certain local coalitions. Senior Baath party\nofficials were forbidden from entering the entire post-Saddam\nadministration, while ordinary members were prevented from entering\nthe top levels of government, thereby ensuring that the top levels of\ngovernment remained completely Baath-free (David 2006: 366). In\naddition, Iraq's military and police services were completely\ndisbanded (see Yaphe 2004), leaving large numbers of trained military\npersonnel without work or purpose.\n\n\nSeveral problems emerged from the U.S. policy of total\nde-Baathification. By excluding so many citizens who had formerly held\npower from government, the CPA ultimately excluded and marginalized a\nlarge swath of the Iraqi population from both governance and the\neconomy; an estimated 60\u201375 percent of those purged were\nunemployed by late 2003 (see The Economist 2003 and David\n2006). To make matters worse, many of those excluded were former\nmilitary and police personnel who were seasoned combat veterans that\nnow sought to turn their military training against the U.S.-led forces\noverseeing the reconstruction and democratization of Iraq.\n\n\nAs a result of the purge of Baath part members throughout the entire\nIraqi government, the CPA was faced with a shortage of qualified\npersonnel to staff the new administration, military, and police forces\n(David 2006: 367). This lack of qualified personnel, combined with\nintensifying attacks against both coalition and administration targets\nand the subsequent difficulty recruiting workers, deeply impacted the\nability of the still-forming government to function. These flaws,\nwhich ultimately obstructed efforts to stabilize Iraq and contributed\nto the large number of causalities caused by insurgents, will be\ndiscussed in greater detail below.\n4.2 Criticisms of Lustration\nLustration policies are often bogged down by the paradoxical nature\nof public trust during a political transition. A strong rationale for\nengaging in administrative purges is to signal that a political\ntransition is real and that the authoritarian past is being put to\nrest. Officials responsible for a transition want to signal that the\nemerging democratic polity will operate differently from its corrupt\nand dangerous predecessor. Such signaling is achieved, inter\nalia, by displacing those who were responsible for administering\nthe corrupt and vicious policies of the past. And surely, public trust\ndoes depend on communicating to ordinary citizens that a fresh\npolitical start has been made\u2014that a new and lawful polity has\nbeen launched. On the other hand, public trust also depends on the\nfunctionality and competence of government. The trains need to run,\nlicenses need to be issued or renewed, roads need to be maintained,\nand public order has to be kept. And if the bureaucratic class that\nknows how to do these things is subtracted from post war politics\nbecause of how it behaved under the previous regime, the daily\noperation of government is likely to suffer. And public trust is\nlikely to tumble accordingly (this is when we begin to hear that\n\u201cat least under Saddam the trains ran on time\u201d, etc.) The\nfirst dilemma of lustration,then, concerns its scope: how does one\nlustrate enough so that public trust (and retributive justice) are\nserved, without lustrating so much that the organs of government are\nundone and public trust is lost as a\n result?[35]\n\n\n\nIt goes without saying that different countries face different\npolitical circumstances when it comes to how much lustration they can\ncarry out: East Germany could afford to purge its civil service rather\nseverely, due to the availability of replacements from the West. Other\nnations, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia, did not have this luxury\nand had often to prioritize stability due to the exigencies and\ninherent dangers of the initial transition period.\nAnother complication impacting the scope of lustration arises from\nthe difficulty in fixing degrees of guilt under totalitarian regimes.\nHere the problem is not so much lustrating in a way that maintains\npublic trust but, rather, figuring out what counts, philosophically,\nas the appropriate degree of guilt to justify lustration in the first\nplace. Mid-level officials in a ruling party mechanism cannot be\nautomatically labeled as enthusiastic or even willing supporters of\nthe machinery of oppression. Some were, some passively found their way\ninto their roles and still others were coerced into them. A morally\nlegitimate policy of lustration must take into account such gradations\nof\n guilt.[36]\n\nBut the ability to determine degrees of culpability requires\nexpensive, lengthy investigations which are often beyond the means of\nthose orchestrating a transition.\n\n\nBeyond these problems of scope lies an epistemological difficulty:\nLustration purges and exclusions frequently, though not always, rely\non testimonials and security service files which are often of dubious\naccuracy. The files are often rife with human error, exaggerations,\nand omissions. The most valuable Communist informants and\ncollaborators were often missing from surviving secret police files\n(many were destroyed or \u201cdisappeared\u201d, probably into KGB\npossession) or were shielded during the process (Minow\n 2000).[37]\n On the other hand,\nemployees of the security services often embellished their accounts\nand added false informants in the period before an audit so that they\ncould meet or exceed their prescribed\n quota.[38]\n\n5. Forgetting\n\n\nHaving examined, in some detail, three of the most important ways in\nwhich nations can come to terms with their past, it is perhaps fitting\nto conclude this entry by considering the possibility that nations do\nnot attempt such a reckoning. Is there anything to be said for\nforgetting in the aftermath of war? Is there an argument to recommend\namnesia as the basis of a political transition? (for a detailed\ntreatment see Rotondi and Eisikovits, forthcoming). \n\n\nMost often, forgetting cannot serve as the basis for peacemaking. It\nis destructive on both the individual and collective levels. It\ncompounds the suffering of individuals by forcing them to watch their\ntormentors walk around freely, reenter politics, or maintain their\nposts in public service and the military. All of this takes place\nwhile their own painful memories and traumas remain unacknowledged.\nFurthermore, policies advocating forgetfulness decrease the chances\nthat victims will be compensated for their suffering. The most common\ninstitutional products of such policies are laws granting amnesty.\nTypically, under such amnesties, perpetrators are protected from both\ncriminal charges and civil liability. Amanda Pike, a reporter for PBS'\nFrontline, tells a story which starkly demonstrates the cost of\nforgetfulness for individual victims. During a trip through the\nCambodian province of Pailin, Pike came across Samrith Phum, whose\nhusband was executed by the Khmer Rouge. Phum knows the murderer well.\nHe is her neighbor and he operates a noodle shop across the street\nfrom her house. He was never arrested and never charged with her\nhusband's murder. There is no procedure through which he can be sued\nfor damages.  Phum must simply get used to the idea that her husband's\nkiller quietly manages his store next door (Pike 2002).\n\n\nOn the national level, a government advocating forgetfulness commits\nthe political correlate of suicide: it undermines the ability of the\ngroup of people it governs to call itself a nation. The French thinker\nErnest Renan (1882) defined a nation as consisting of\n two things, which, in truth, are really just\none\u2026One is in the past, the other in the present. One is the\npossession in common of a rich legacy of memories; the other is\ncurrent consent, the desire to live together, the willingness to\ncontinue to maintain the value of the heritage that one has received\nas a common possession.\n\nForgetting destroys both elements. It undermines the possibility of a\ncommon history by excluding an entire class of memories. At the same\ntime, it obliterates the desire of formerly hostile parties to live\ntogether, or the possibility of social solidarity, by creating a\nbubbling, poisonous, pool of resentment among an entire group of\n\n people.[39]\n\n Now Renan was far from na\u00efve. He admits that\n\u201cforgetting\u201d and perhaps even \u201chistorical\nerror\u201d are essential in the creation of national identity. Later\nhe adds that \u201cthe essence of a nation is that all individuals\nhave many things in common and also that they have forgotten many\nthings.\u201d Descriptively, he is surely right. Heroic\nhistoriography and intentional forgetting was instrumental in creating\nAmerican, Israeli, Turkish, Spanish, and French contemporary\nidentities, to mention but a few. But identities based on amnesia are\nrarely stable.  Israel's new historians, the countless young Armenians\nlobbying parliaments all over the world to recognize the Armenian\ngenocide almost a century after it took place, and the recent Spanish\n\u201cHistorical Memory Law\u201d (2007) all attest that it is\ndifficult to simply bury the past. If the groups that have been\nforgotten are not annihilated, their painful memories continue to\nfester until they eventually erupt in renewed conflict.\n\n\nBut what if all parties involved in a conflict really want to forget?\nWhat if there is a tacit or explicit agreement not to dwell on the\npast? What are we to make of Mozambique, for example, where in the\naftermath of a long, bloody civil war, the combatants actively elected\nnot to address past atrocities? In her superb book on truth\ncommissions, Hayner (2002) describes an election rally in post-war\nMozambique in which a candidate was literally chased out of a hall for\nbringing up the conflict. Can we really make a normative argument for\nremembering if both sides freely chose to forget? One possible way to\nmake such an argument is by analogy. It is quite clear to us that, in\nthe domestic context, the fact that two sides to a conflict agree to\nbury the hatchet does not preclude their prosecution by the criminal\njustice authorities. Thus, if two neighboring families become\nentangled in a massive brawl, during which property on both sides is\ndestroyed, and some injuries are sustained, the District Attorney's\noffice may decide to issue indictments, even if all of those who did\nthe fighting would like to put the whole incident behind them. The\ncriminal law is not a private matter completely at the discretion of\ncitizens. The public has a stake in upholding the criminal law, and is\nunderstood to be an interested party whenever it is broken. After all,\nin the example provided above, wider interests were compromised:\ntraffic may have been disturbed by the fighting, the small children of\nother neighbors may have been watching, publicly funded hospitals may\nhave been called on to treat the injured, reports of the fight may\nhave made their way into the news media bringing down house prices,\netc. In short, the fight, almost any fight, has repercussions for\nthird parties. That is why, in important ways, such fights are\neveryone's business. And that is why criminal cases are typically\ntitled Commonwealth vs. Jones rather than Smith vs.  Jones.\n\n\nIs there an analogous argument to be made about the aftermath of\npolitical conflict? Are there any third party interests that may\njustify some kind of reckoning with mass atrocity, even if all of\nthose involved would freely choose to put the past behind them? Fully\nanswering this question is beyond the scope of this entry, so we shall\nsimply gesture at some of the difficulties that need to be addressed\nin order to do justice to it.\n\n\nFirst, who are the third parties whose interests are implicated by a\ndecision on the part of two warring parties to bury the past? Could we\nargue that, given the intense media coverage given to political\nconflicts, a failure to address massive violations of human rights in\nlocation X (for whatever reason) may endanger human rights in\nlocation Y (by, say, bolstering the confidence of would be\nperpetrators)? If so the third party could be described, vaguely, as\nthe international community, a community with a serious interest in\ncreating a robust culture of human rights wherein violations are\ndocumented and addressed rather than simply ignored.\n\n\nSecond, even if we agree that there are interested third parties in\nthe international context, how could such parties ensure that their\ninterests are protected? What sort of enforcement power do they have?\nHere the answers are both legal and political. The nascent\nInternational Criminal Court may be used in cases where its authority\ncomes into play. Perhaps more significantly, the international\ncommunity (or, more specifically, the most powerful international\nplayers) may resort to political pressure. After all, countries such\nas Mozambique, emerging from prolonged wars, are desperately dependent\non international aid. Donor countries could, accordingly, make aid\ncontingent on the addressing of past atrocities.\n When all is said and done, it appears that the main difference\nbetween the domestic and international cases has to do with the\nconsequences of the decision whether to use the courts. While in the\ndomestic arena a failure to prosecute can result in increased cynicism\nabout the law (and eventually in a weakening of the rule of law),\nimposing accountability in the aftermath of war may, under some\ncircumstances, reignite violence. Insisting on doing justice in such\ncases recalls Lord Mansfield's famous dictum in the 1772 Somerset\ncase: that justice must be done \u201cthough the heavens may\nfall.\u201d The trouble, of course, with this Kantian pronouncement\nis that there is no one to reap the fruits of justice after the\nheavens have fallen.",
