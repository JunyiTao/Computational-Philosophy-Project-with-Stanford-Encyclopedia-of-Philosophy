Consequentialism, Emotivism and Moral Reform\n\nThe criterion of expected utility had another advantage for Russell.\nIt allowed him to recommend a less \u201cconservative and\nanti-reforming\u201d version of Moore\u2019s principle that \u201cthe\nindividual can be confidently recommended \u2026 to conform to rules\nwhich are generally useful and generally practiced.\u201d Russell was\nan act-consequentialist rather than a rule-consequentialist. An act is\nright if the expected consequences of performing it are as good or\nbetter than any other. It is not right because it conforms to some\nrule, even a rule that it is generally useful to obey. Nevertheless,\nrules are necessary because we do not have world enough and time to\ncalculate the consequences of every act.\n\n\nI think that, speaking philosophically, all acts ought to be judged by\ntheir effects; but as this is difficult and uncertain and takes time,\nit is desirable, in practice, that some kinds of acts should be\ncondemned and others praised without waiting to investigate\nconsequences. I should say, therefore, with the utilitarians, that the\nright act, in any given circumstances, is that which, on the data,\nwill probably produce the greatest balance of good over evil of all\nthe acts that are possible; but that the performance of such acts may\nbe promoted by the existence of a moral code. (RoE:\n216/Power: 168)\n\n\nThus Russell believed that it is generally right to obey\n\u201cgenerally useful\u201d rules, though these are \u201crules of\nthumb\u201d and there may be circumstances in which it is right (that\nis obligatory) to break them.\n\n\nEven the best moral rules, however, will have some\nexceptions, since no class of actions always has bad [or\ngood!] results. (RoE: 137/Religion and Science:\n227\u20138)\n\n\nBut though Russell thought it is generally right to obey generally\nuseful rules, he also thought that many of the rules that are\n\u201cgenerally practiced\u201d are not \u201cgenerally\nuseful\u201d. Sometimes they derive from bygone superstitions and\nsometimes they foster the interests of the powerful at other peoples\nexpense.\n\n\nPrimitive ethics \u2026select certain modes of behavior for censure\n[or praise] for reasons which are lost in anthropological obscurity.\n(Education and the Social Order: 23)\n\n\nHowever,\n\n\none of the purposes\u2014usually in large part unconscious\u2014of a\ntraditional morality is to make the existing social system work. It\nachieves this purpose, when it is successful, both more cheaply and\nmore effectively than a police force does \u2026 The most obvious\nexample \u2026 is the inculcation of obedience. It is (or rather\nwas) the duty of children to submit to parents, wives to husbands,\nservants to masters, subjects to princes, and (in religious matters)\nlaymen to priests. (RoE: 207/Power: 157)\n\n\nThus Russell was inclined to agree with Plato\u2019s Thrasymachus, at least\nto the extent that what passes for justice is often\n[to] the advantage of the stronger [that is the ruling caste, class or\ngender]. Russell was opposed both to power-moralities (codes designed\nto bolster the interests of exploitative elites) and to the senseless\nand often pernicious remnants of defunct superstitions.\n\n\nAn ethic not derived from superstition must decide first upon the kind\nof social effects which it desires to achieve and the social effects\nwhich it desires to avoid. It must then decide, as far as knowledge\npermits, what acts will promote the desired consequences: these acts\nit will praise, while those acts having a contrary tendency it will\ncondemn. (Education and the Social Order: 73)\n\n\nIt was Russell\u2019s mission as a practical moralist, a social reformer\nand a popular sage to promote a humane and non-superstitious ethic.\nThis was partly a matter of preaching and partly a matter of argument:\npreaching as regards ends and argument as regards means.\n\nIn the latter, and more preachy, part of his career, it was Russell\u2019s\ndominant view that judgments about what things are good or bad as ends\ndo not have a truth-value. To say that it is a good thing \u201cthat\nthe individual, like Leibniz\u2019s monads should mirror the world\u201d\n(Education and the Social Order: 10) is to say something like\n\u201cWould that everyone desired that the individual, like one of\nLeibniz\u2019s monads, should mirror the world!\u201d Since this is\nneither true nor false, it cannot be rationally argued for. The best\nwe can do is to remove objections and present the end in a favorable\nlight. Russell was perfectly clear about this.\n\n\nWhy [should the individual mirror the world]? I cannot say why, except\nthat knowledge and comprehensiveness appear to me glorious attributes\nin virtue of which I prefer Newton to an oyster. The man who holds\nconcentrated within his own mind, as within a camera obscura,\nthe depths of space, the evolution of the sun and its planets, the\ngeological ages of the earth, and the brief history of humanity,\nappears to me to be doing what is distinctively human and what adds\nmost to the diversified spectacle of nature.\n\n\nThis is eloquent stuff (and too me, at least, convincing) but it\nhardly constitutes an argument. And this Russell freely admitted.\n\n\nUltimate values are not matters as to which argument is possible. If a\nman maintains that misery is desirable and that it would be a good\nthing if everybody always had a violent toothache, we may disagree\nwith him, and we may laugh at him if we catch him going to the\ndentist, but we cannot prove that he is mistaken as we could if he\nsaid that iron is lighter than water \u2026 As to ultimate values,\nmen may agree or disagree, they may fight with guns or with ballot\npapers but they cannot reason logically. (Education and the Social\nOrder: 136)\n\n\nThis is rather disconcerting, especially if we replace the comic\nexamples that Russell employs in Education and the Social\nOrder (he imagines a prophet \u201cwho advance[s] the theory\nthat happiness should be confined to those whose first names begin\nwith Z\u201d) with the real-life moral elitists and chauvinists that\nhe discusses in other works of the 1930s and 1940s. Nietzsche and the\nNazis really did believe that the sufferings of some people were not\nsignificant evils (herd-men in the case of Nietzsche, Jews, Slavs and\nGypsies in the case of the Nazis) and it was Russell\u2019s thesis that no\nrational argument could be advanced against them.\n\n\nLet us consider two theories as to the good. One says, like\nChristianity, Kant, and democracy: whatever the good may be, any one\nman\u2019s enjoyment of it has the same value as any other man\u2019s. The other\nsays: there is a certain sub-class of mankind\u2014white men,\nGermans, gentiles, or what not\u2014whose good or evil alone counts\nin an estimation of ends; other men are only to be considered as means\n\u2026 When [irrelevant] arguments are swept away, there remains, so\nfar as I can see, nothing to be said except for each party to express\nmoral disapproval of the other. Those who reject this conclusion\nadvance no argument against it except that it is unpleasant.\n(\u201cReply to Criticisms\u201d RoE: 146\u2013147/Papers\n11: 48\u201349)\n\n\nBut unpleasant as this conclusion may be, it does not imply that those\nwith a humane and egalitarian conception of the good should give up\npreaching on its behalf. On the contrary, such preaching becomes\nimperative, especially for those with rhetorical gifts. Which is why\nRussell devoted so much time and effort to this activity.\n\n\nAccording to me, the person who judges that A is good is\nwishing others to feel certain desires. He will therefore, if not\nhindered by other activities, try to rouse these desires in other\npeople if he thinks he knows how to do so. This is the purpose of\npreaching, and it was my purpose in the various books in which I have\nexpressed ethical opinions. The art of presenting one\u2019s desires\npersuasively is totally different from that of logical demonstration,\nbut it is equally legitimate. (\u201cReply to Criticisms\u201d\nRoE: 149/Papers 11: 51)\n\n\nPersuasion as regards ends may be a non-rational process, but that\ndoes not mean that it is irrational, let alone wrong, to\nengage in it.\n\nWhen it comes to means however, rational argument becomes a genuine\npossibility. It might seem otherwise since judgments about what is\nright or what ought to be done\u2014which for Russell are essentially\nconcerned with means\u2014would appear to be as incapable of truth as\njudgments about what is good and bad. In Russell\u2019s view, \u201cthe\nright act, in any given circumstances, is that which, on the\ndata, will probably produce the greatest balance of good over\nevil\u201d and the right rule or policy is likewise\nthe one that can be expected to produce the best effects. That is,\n\u201cX is right\u201d is assertible (roughly, a\nsensible thing to say) when X can be expected to lead to the\nbest results. But if \u201cY is good\u201d, is really in the\noptative mood, amounting to the exclamation \u201cWould that everyone\ndesired Y!\u201d, then \u201cX is right\u201d would\nappear to be optative too, since it comes down to something like\n\u201cX leads to more of what [would that everyone\ndesired!]\u201d. Here, the clause in square brackets, which is\nobviously in the optative mood, infects the entire sentence with its\noptative character. \u201cX leads to more of what [would that\neveryone desired!]\u201d, in so far as it can be made sense of, does\nnot seem to be the kind of thing that could be true or false.\n\nHowever, Russell believed that judgments about what is right or what\nought to be done can be given an analysis which gives them a\nsort of ersatz objectivity and hence the possibility of truth. If\nDmitri has a reasonably determinate conception of the good, that is, a\ncoherent set of opinions about which things are good and which bad,\nthen although Dmitri\u2019s opinions themselves are neither true\nnor false\u2014since, despite appearances they are not really\nopinions at all but optative expressions of Dmitri\u2019s desires\u2014it\ncan nevertheless be true or false that X is good in Dmitri\u2019s\nopinion, that is, good-according-to-Dmitri. \u201cOh to be in\nEngland, now that April\u2019s here!\u201d is neither true nor false, but\nif I say it sincerely, it will in fact be true that I desire to be in\nEngland. Similarly, if Dmitri says that \u201cBungy-jumping is\ngood\u201d what he says won\u2019t be true, since really it is in the\noptative mood, but if he says it sincerely, it will be true that\nBungy-jumping is good-in-Dmitri\u2019s-opinion, or\ngood-according-to-Dmitri. Thus although there are no facts of the\nmatter about which things are good or bad, there are facts of\nthe matter about which things are believed by this or that\nperson to be good or bad. Furthermore\u2014and this is the crucial\npoint\u2014there are facts of the matter about whether a given action\nor a given policy is likely to promote what somebody-or-other\nbelieves to be good. Since Hitler believed that victory over\nBritain would be good, there was a fact of the matter about whether\nbombing London as opposed to bombing the RAF\u2019s airfields would be\nlikely bring about the states of affairs that he desired. As it turned\nout, the policy he pursued did not produce results that were\nbest-according-to-Hitler. Hence if Hitler had adopted a\nconsequentialist reading of \u201cought\u201d, and had indexed it to\nhis own requirements, \u201cI ought to bomb London\u201d (as said by\nHitler) would have been false. And its truth or its falsehood\nwould have been a factually arguable question.\n\nNow, suppose we define the right act with respect to\nB, not as \u201cthat which, on the data, will probably produce\nthe greatest balance of good over evil\u201d but as \u201cthat\nwhich, on the data, will probably produce the greatest balance of what\nB believes to be good over what B believes to be\nevil\u201d. The right rule of policy with respect to B will\ncorrespondingly be defined as the rule or policy that will probably,\nin the appropriate circumstances, produce the greatest balance of what\nB believes to be good over what B believes to be\nevil. Then, so long as B has a reasonably coherent set of\nideals, the claim that a given act or policy is right or wrong with\nrespect to B will usually have a determinate truth-value.\nClaims of the form \u201cX is right wrt to B\u201d\nwill be either true or false, so long as the person (or group of\npersons) designated by B has a clear and consistent set of\nvalues. There will thus be a fact of the matter about whether X\nis right wrt to B which can be the subject of rational enquiry.\nAnd if \u201cB\u201d stands in for us (whoever\n\u201cwe\u201d may be) and if we share a reasonably\ncoherent set of ideals, then there will be a fact of the matter about\nwhether X is right or wrong with respect to our ideals. Thus if\nthere is agreement with respect to ideals and if we adopt a\nconsequentialist conception of rightness, indexed, not to what\nis good, but to what we believe to be good, then we\ncan have a rational debate\u2014maybe even a scientific\nenquiry\u2014about the rights and wrongs of actions, rules or\npolicies, or at least about their rightness or wrongness with respect\nto us.\n\n\nThe framing of moral rules, so long as the ultimate Good is supposed\nknown, [Russell should have said \u2018supposed agreed\u2019] is a\nmatter for science. For example: should capital punishment be\ninflicted for theft, or only for murder, or not at all? Jeremy\nBentham, who considered pleasure to be the Good, devoted himself to\nworking out what criminal code would most promote pleasure, and\nconcluded that it ought to be much less severe than that prevailing in\nhis day. All this, except the proposition that pleasure is the Good,\ncomes within the sphere of science. (RoE:\n137\u2013138/Religion and Science: 228\u2013229)\n\n\nOnce the ends have been agreed, we can have a rational debate about\nthe code most likely to promote those ends. In some cases, such\nquestions can be resolved by scientific enquiry, or at any rate by\nstatistics. But (with one or two exceptions) rational argument is only\nreally possible when we take the ends as read and confine our\nattention to the means.\n\nWe are now in a position to understand Russell\u2019s general strategy as a\npolemicist for moral reform and its relation to his emotivist\nmeta-ethic.\n\nHe dismisses supposed duties that cannot be given a\nconsequentialist justification as the products of bygone superstitions\nor, in some cases, the ideological props to predatory elites.\nHe uses non-rational methods to preach the goodness of some\nends\u2014a life inspired by love and guided by knowledge, mirroring\nthe cosmos like one of Leibniz\u2019s monads etc.\u2014and the evil of\nothers. This is essentially a process of getting his readers to share\nhis desires.\nHe then argues for his revised code of conduct as likely to\npromote those ends. Here there can be truth and falsehood and\nconsequently rational argument, but only because \u201cought\u201d\nand \u201cright\u201d have been given a consequentialist reading and\nindexed to the ends that Russell desires to promote.\n\n",
