Parthood is\ntransitive, so from atoms a and b only one further\nobject can be \u201cgenerated\u201d, the mereological sum\nof a and b. A set-forming operation, however, will\ndistinguish, for instance, between {a, b} (the set\nof a and b) and {{a, b}} (the set\ncontaining the set of a and b) and {{a},\n{b}} (the set containing the singleton set of a and\nthe singleton set of b). None of the these three are pairwise\nidentical. Membership is not transitive. The first and third contain\ntwo members, but not the same members (both a and b\nare members of the first set, but not of the third), while the second\nset has only one member (namely the first set). All three (and\ninfinitely many others) are generated from the same atoms, however, or\nas Goodman might put it, they have the same content: a\nand b. A system featuring a set-theoretic generating relation\nthus does not count as nominalistic.\nThe sameness-of-content criterion was criticized by David Lewis\n(1991, 40) as question-begging. Lewis suggests that the only\nalternatives for generating relations that Goodman allows are\nmereological, set-theoretical, or a combination of the two, and that\nonly mereological generation passes the test. Unless one rejects set\ntheory already, Lewis contends, one would not find the criterion\nplausible. There are, however, non-extensional mereological systems\nthat violate the sameness-of-content criterion as well (see entry\non mereology). Moreover, the\nsameness-of-content criterion may be understood as a version of \nOckham\u2019s Razor, demanding not to multiply entities beyond necessity.\n3.2 Mereology\nThe Polish logician Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski (1886\u20131939) must\nsurely count as the father of mereology\u2014the theory of parts and\nwholes\u2014but around 1930, Goodman re-invents the theory together\nwith his fellow graduate student Henry S. Leonard\n(1905\u20131967). Only in 1935 do Goodman and Leonard learn of\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s work through one of their fellow students, W.V.  Quine\n(Quine 1985, 122). An early version of Leonard and Goodman\u2019s system is\ncontained in Leonard\u2019s Ph.D. thesis, Singular Terms (Leonard\n1930). In 1936, Leonard and Goodman present their mature system at a\nmeeting of the Association of Symbolic Logic; the corresponding paper\nis published four years later under the title \u201cThe Calculus of\nIndividuals and Its Uses\u201d (Leonard and Goodman\n1940). Subsequently, Goodman uses the calculus in his own\nPh.D. thesis, A Study of Qualities (SQ), and a version of it\nin The Structure of Appearance (SA). Little is known about\nthe nature of Goodman and Leonard\u2019s cooperation on the calculus.\nGoodman attributes the first thought for the collaborative project to\nLeonard (PP, 149). Leonard, more concretely, suggests in a (still)\nunpublished note:\n\nIf responsibilities can be divided in a collaborative enterprise, I\nbelieve that it may be fairly stated that the major responsibility for\nthe formal calculus [\u2026] was mine, while the major\nresponsibility for discussions of applications [\u2026] lay with\nGoodman. (Leonard 1967)\n\nQuine only mentions that he himself \u201cwas able to help them on\na technical problem\u201d (Quine 1985, 122). Leonard\u2019s system\nof Singular Terms is significantly different from, and indeed\nin philosophically interesting ways weaker than, the Calculus of\nIndividuals (Rossberg 2009), but the exact extent of Goodman\u2019s\ntechnical contribution to the calculus remains unknown.\nPerhaps surprisingly, nominalistic scruples were not the driving\nforce behind the development the Calculus of Individuals. Instead, their goal is to\nsolve a technical problem in Carnap\u2019s Aufbau (1928) (see\n section 4 below), \nand to this end they employ both set-theoretic and mereological\nnotions. Leonard, in his Ph.D.  thesis (supervised by Alfred North\nWhitehead), presents his calculus as \u201can interpolation in\nWhitehead and Russell\u2019s Principia Mathematica between *14 and\n*20\u201d (Leonard 1967), and makes liberal use of class-terms in the\nformulation (Leonard 1930). Also the joint\npaper of Leonard and Goodman is formulated using class terms, as is\nthe system Goodman used in his own Ph.D. thesis, A Study of\nQualities (1941, SQ). It is not until his joint article with\nQuine (Goodman and Quine 1947) and his Structure of\nAppearance (1951, SA) that Goodman eschews the use of set theory\nto formulate the Calculus of Individuals.\nAs mentioned above, parthood, as opposed to the set-theoretic\nnotion of membership, is transitive: if a is a part\nof b and b is a part of c, then a\nis a part of c. Neither the system Leonard and Goodman\npresent in their 1940 article, nor the version in Goodman\u2019s A\nStudy of Qualities, nor the calculus he uses in The Structure\nof Appearance, take \u201cpart\u201d as primitive. Rather, it\nis in all three cases defined based on the sole primitive notion\nadopted: overlap in SA, and discreteness in the\nother two systems. Overlap can pre-systematically be understood as\nsharing a part in common; discreteness as sharing no part in\ncommon. All three systems indeed define parthood so that these two\npre-systematic understandings come out as theorems.\nThe Calculus of Individuals in all its formulations contains\nprinciples of mereological summation and mereological fusion.\nMereological summation is a binary function of individuals, so that\nthe sum s of two individuals a and b is\nsuch that both a and b, and all their parts, are\nparts of s\u2014and also all sums of parts of a\nand b and are parts of s. Mereological fusion is a\ngeneralization of the mereological summation. In Leonard and Goodman\n1940 fusion is defined using sets: all the members of a set \u03b1\nare \u201cfused\u201d in the sense that they, and all their parts,\nand all the fusions amongst their parts, end up being parts of the\nindividual that is the fusion of set \u03b1.\nThe technical details of the different versions of the Calculus of\nIndividuals can be found in this supplementary document:\nThe Calculus of Individuals in its different versions\n (see also entry on \n mereology).\nUnrestricted mereological fusion has been widely criticized as too\npermissive. \nIt allows for so-called scattered objects (e.g., the sum of the Eiffel\nTower and the Moon) and in the case of Goodman\u2019s construction\nin The Structure of Appearance for sums of radically\ndifferent kinds of objects, like sounds and colors. W.V. Quine, after\nendorsing this principle in a joint paper with Goodman (Goodman and\nQuine 1947), becomes one of its first critics in his review of The\nStructure of Appearance:\n\npart, clear initially as a spatio-temporal concept, is here\nunderstood only by spatio-temporal analogy. [\u2026] When finally we\nproceed to sums of heterogeneous qualia, say a color and two sounds\nand a position and a moment, the analogy tries the imagination. (Quine\n1951b, 559)\n\nGoodman (1956) maintains that the criticism is disingenuous if put\nforward by a platonist: set-theoretic \u201ccomposition\u201d is as\nleast as permissive as mereological fusion. Whenever there is a fusion\nof scattered concrete objects, there is also a set of them (see Simons\n1987 or van Inwagen 1990 for prominent criticisms of unrestricted\ncomposition).\n",
