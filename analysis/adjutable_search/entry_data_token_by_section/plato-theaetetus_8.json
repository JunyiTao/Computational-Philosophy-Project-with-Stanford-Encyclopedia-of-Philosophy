Mostly\nthey have divided along the lines described in section 3, taking\neither a Revisionist or a Unitarian view of Part One of the\nTheaetetus.\n\n\nRevisionists say that the target of the critique of 160e\u2013186e is\neverything that has been said in support and development of\nD1 ever since 151. Unitarians argue that Plato\u2019s\ncriticism of D1 in 160e\u2013186e is more selective.\nObviously his aim is to refute D1, the equation of\nknowledge with perception. But that does not oblige him to reject the\naccount of perception that has been offered in support of\nD1. And Plato does not reject this account: he\naccepts it.\n\n\nThus the Unitarian Cornford argues that Plato is not rejecting the\nHeracleitean flux theory of perception. He is rejecting only\nD1\u2019s claim that knowledge is that sort of\nperception. It remains possible that perception is just as Heracleitus\ndescribes it. Likewise, Cornford suggests, the Protagorean doctrine\nthat \u201cman is the measure of all things\u201d is true provided\nit is taken to mean only \u201call things that we\nperceive.\u201d\n\n\nIf some form of Unitarianism is correct, an examination of 160\u2013186\nshould show that Plato\u2019s strategy in the critique of\nD1 highlights two distinctions:\n\nA distinction between the claim that the objects of\nperception are in flux, and the claim that everything is\nin flux.\nA distinction between bare sensory awareness, and judgement on\nthe basis of such awareness.\n\n\n\nOne vital passage for distinction (1) is 181b\u2013183b. If Unitarianism is\nright, this passage should be an attack on the Heracleitean thesis\nthat everything is in flux, but not an attack on the\nHeracleitean thesis that the objects of perception are in\nflux. According to Unitarians, the thesis that the objects of\nperception are in flux is a Platonic thesis too. Readers should ask\nthemselves whether this is the right way to read 181b \u2013183b.\n\n\nDistinction (2) seems to be explicitly stated at 179c. There also\nseems to be clear evidence of distinction (2) in the final argument\nagainst D1, at 184\u2013187. Distinction (2) is also at\nwork, apparently, in the discussion of some of the nine objections\naddressed to the Protagorean theory. Some of these objections can\nplausibly be read as points about the unattractive consequences of\nfailing to distinguish the Protagorean claim that bare sense-awareness\nis incorrigible (as the Unitarian Plato agrees) from the further\nProtagorean claim that judgements about sense-awareness are\nincorrigible (which the Unitarian Plato denies).\n\n\nThe criticism of D1 breaks down into twelve separate\narguments, interrupted by the Digression (172c\u2013177c: translated and\ndiscussed separately in section 6d). There is no space here to comment\nin detail on every one of these arguments, some of which, as noted\nabove, have often been thought frivolous or comically intended\n(cp. 152e1\u2013153d5). Some brief notes on the earlier objections will\nshow what the serious point of each might be.\n\n\nThe first objection to Protagoras (160e\u2013161d) observes that if all\nperceptions are true, then there is no reason to think that animal\nperceptions are inferior to human ones: a situation which Socrates\nfinds absurd.\n\n\nIf this objection is really concerned with perceptions strictly so\ncalled, then it obviously fails. Protagoras just accepts this\nsupposedly absurd consequence; and apparently he is right to do so. If\nwe consider animals and humans just as perceivers, there is no\nautomatic reason to prefer human perceptions. Many animal perceptions\nare superior to human perceptions (dogs\u2019 hearing, hawks\u2019\neyesight, dolphins\u2019 echolocatory ability, most mammals\u2019 sense of\nsmell, etc.), and the Greeks knew it, cf. Homer\u2019s commonplace remarks\nabout \u201cfar-sighted eagles\u201d, or indeed Aristotle, in the\nEudemian Ethics, 1231a5\u20136. The objection works much better\nrephrased as an objection about\njudgements about perceptions, rather than about\nperceptions strictly so called. Humans are no more and no\nless perceivers than pigs, baboons, or tadpoles. But they are\ndifferent in their powers of judgement about perceptions.  \n\n\nThis distinction between arguments against a Protagorean view about\nperception and a Protagorean view about judgement about perception is\nrelevant to the second objection too (161d\u2013162a). This objection (cp.\nCratylus 386c) makes the point that Protagoras\u2019 theory\nimplies that no one is wiser than anyone else. Notably, the argument\ndoes not attack the idea that perception is\ninfallible. Rather, it attacks the idea that the opinion or judgement\nthat anyone forms on the basis of perception is infallible\n(161d3). (This is an important piece of support for Unitarianism:\ncp. distinction (2) above.)\n\n\nA third objection to Protagoras\u2019 thesis is very quickly stated in\nSocrates\u2019 two rhetorical questions at 162c2\u20136. Since Protagoras\u2019\nthesis implies that all perceptions are true, it not only has the\nallegedly absurd consequence that animals\u2019 perceptions are not\ninferior to humans. It also has the consequence that humans\u2019\nperceptions are not inferior to the gods\u2019. This consequence too is now\nsaid to be absurd.\n\n\nAs with the first two objections, so here. If we consider divinities\nand humans just as perceivers, there is no automatic reason to prefer\ndivine perceptions, and hence no absurdity. Plato may well want us to\ninfer that the Greek gods are not different just in respect of being\nperceivers from humans. But they are different in\ntheir powers of judgement about perceptions.\n\n\nThe next four arguments (163a\u2013168c) present counter-examples to the\nalleged equivalence of knowledge and perception. The fourth observes\nthat, if perception = knowledge, then anyone who perceives an\nutterance in a given language should have knowledge of that utterance,\ni.e., understand it\u2014which plainly doesn\u2019t happen. The fifth\nraises a similar problem about memory and perception: remembering\nthings is knowing them, but not perceiving them. The\nsixth (the \u201ccovered eye\u201d) objection contrasts not\nperceiving an object (in one sensory modality) with not\nknowing it. If perception = knowledge, seeing an object with one\neye and not seeing it with the other would appear to be a case of the\ncontradictory state of both knowing it and not knowing it. The seventh\npoints out that one can perceive dimly or faintly, clearly or\nunclearly, but that these adverbial distinctions do not apply to ways\nof knowing\u2014as they must if knowing is perceiving.\n\n\nIn 165e4\u2013168c5, Socrates sketches Protagoras\u2019s response to these seven\nobjections. Protagoras makes two main points. First, he can meet some\nof the objections by distinguishing types and occasions of\nperception. Second, teaching as he understands it is not a matter of\ngetting the pupil to have true rather than false beliefs. Since there\nare no false beliefs, the change that a teacher can effect is not a\nchange from false belief to true belief or knowledge. Rather,\nProtagoras\u2019 model of teaching is a therapeutic model. What a\ngood teacher does, according to him, is use arguments (or discourses:\nlogoi) as a good doctor uses drugs, to replace the state of\nthe soul in which \u201cbad things are and appear\u201d with one in\nwhich \u201cgood things are and appear.\u201d While all\nbeliefs are true, not all beliefs are\nbeneficial.\n\n\nA difficulty for Protagoras\u2019 position here is that, if all beliefs are\ntrue, then all beliefs about which beliefs are beneficial must be\ntrue. But surely, some beliefs about which beliefs are beneficial\ncontradict other beliefs about which beliefs are beneficial;\nespecially if some people are better than others at bringing about\nbeneficial beliefs. (For example, no doubt Plato\u2019s and Protagoras\u2019\nbeliefs conflict at this point.) This means that Protagoras\u2019 view\nentails a contradiction of the same sort as the next\nobjection\u2013the famous peritrop\u00ea\u2014seems to be\nmeant to bring out.\n\n\nThe peritrop\u00ea (\u201ctable-turning\u201d) objection\n(171a\u2013b) is this. Suppose I believe, as Protagoras does, that\n\u201cAll beliefs are true,\u201d but also admit that \u201cThere\nis a belief that \u2018Not all beliefs are true\u2019.\u201d If all\nbeliefs are true, the belief that \u201cNot all beliefs are\ntrue\u201d must be true too. But if that belief is true, then by\ndisquotation, not all beliefs are true.  So I refute myself by\ncontradicting myself; and the same holds for Protagoras.\n\n\nThe validity of the objection has been much\ndisputed. Burnyeat, Denyer and Sedley all offer reconstructions of the\nobjection that make it come out valid. McDowell and Bostock suggest\nthat although the objection does not prove what it is meant to prove\n(self-contradiction), it does prove a different point (about\nself-defeat) which is equally worth making. \n\n\nSocrates\u2019 ninth objection presents Protagoras\u2019 theory with a\ndilemma. If the theory is completely general in its application, then\nit must say that not only what counts as justice in cities,\nbut also what benefits cities, is a relative matter. As\nProtagoras has already admitted (167a3), it is implausible to say that\nbenefit is a relative notion. But the alternative, which Protagoras\napparently prefers, is a conceptual divorce between the notions of\njustice and benefit, which restrict the application of Protagoras\u2019\ntheory to the notion of justice. Socrates obviously finds this\nconceptual divorce unattractive, though he does not, directly, say\nwhy. Instead, he offers us the Digression.\n",
