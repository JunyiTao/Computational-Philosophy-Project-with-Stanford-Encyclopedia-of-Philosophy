    "main_text": "Moral character and empirical studies || Some replies to situationism\n5.3 Some empirical approaches to Aristotelian views of character\n\nSome recent philosophical work on character aims to meet the\nskepticism of the situationist challenge directly, by developing a\ntheory of virtue grounded in psychological studies that are compatible\nwith the existence of robust traits. This section provides a brief\nsummary of two such approaches to virtue.\n\nFor extensive and nuanced discussion, see Miller (2013, 2014) and\nSection 2 of the entry on\n empirical approaches to moral character,\n section 2. \n\nOne approach is inspired by the \u201ccognitive-affective personality\nsystem\u201d (the so-called CAPS model) that has been developed by\nsocial and cognitive psychologists. Rather than looking for empirical\nevidence of robust traits in behavioral regularities across different\ntypes of situations, the CAPS model (and philosophers impressed by\nthis model) focus on the importance of how agents understand the\nsituations they are in. The model views the structure of personality\nas the organization of relationships among \u201ccognitive-affective\nunits\u201d. These units are clusters of dispositions to feel,\ndesire, believe, and plan that, once activated, cause various\nthoughts, feelings, and behavior to be formed. Philosophers who ground\ntheir understanding of virtue in this type of psychological theory\nextend the CAPS model to cover robust virtuous traits of character.\nThese traits are viewed as enduring dispositions that include the\nappropriate clusters of thinking (practical reason), desire, and\nfeeling, manifested in cross-situational behavior.\n\nFor detailed discussion of the CAPS model and its possible value to\nphilosophers, see Miller (2003, 2014), Russell (2009) and Snow\n(2010).\n\nOther philosophers do not find the extension of the CAPS model\nespecially helpful, for it does not seem to move us past what we\ncommonsenically recognize as virtue. We are prepared to begin with the\nidea that being virtuous is not just being disposed to act, but also\nto feel, respond, and to reason. And not simply to reason, but to\nreason well. For this approach to be helpful, we need some account of\nwhat excellent practical reasoning consists in.\n\nSome philosophers aim to provide what is needed by looking to\npsychological studies of enjoyment. They propose that virtues are\nanalogous to (some) skills, in that the kind of habituation involved\nin developing and acting from virtuous character is like the sort of\nintelligent habituation typical of the development and exercise of\n(some) complex skills. The empirical studies of enjoyment show that,\nother things being equal, we enjoy the exercise of developed\nabilities, and the more complex the ability, the more we enjoy its\nexercise. If the acquisition and exercise of virtue is analogous to\nthe development and exercise of complex ability, we can, this approach\nsuggests, explain a variety of central points about virtuous activity\n\u2013 for example, that, like (some) skills, virtuous activity is\nexperienced as being its own end, as being enjoyable in itself, and\nthus as valued for its own sake. For discussion of virtue as similar\nto complex skill, see Annas (2011), Bloomfield (2014), Stichter (2007,\n2011), and cf. Sherman (1989).\n\nSituationists might nevertheless reply that to emphasize the role of\nexpertise in practical reasoning is to make good moral character an\nideal that too few of us, if any, can achieve. On some conceptions of\nmoral knowledge, such as that proposed by Plato in the\nRepublic, acquiring the knowledge necessary for virtue takes\nover 50 years of psychological and intellectual training. And on\nAristotle\u2019s view, as this entry has indicated in Section 2.4\nabove, the full realization of our rational powers that is required\nfor good moral character is not something that we can achieve on our\nown. The development and preservation of good moral character requires\npolitical institutions that promote the conditions under which\nself-love and friendship flourish. The situationist might wonder how\nuseful traditional conceptions of good character can be, if acquiring\nvirtuous character is a long and difficult process made possible by\nsocial institutions that do not yet exist. The situationist may take\nthese problems as support for his view that we are better off thinking\nin terms of local traits rather than robust traits.\n\nIn ending, it is appropriate to recall the discussion in Section 4,\nabove. On the one hand, on a view of character such as\nAristotle\u2019s, which relies on ordinary capacities to experience\nthe pleasures of self-expression and to respond with friendly feelings\nto others\u2019 efforts to help, almost everyone is capable of\nbecoming better. On the other hand, if Aristotle and others\n(such as Marx, Mill, T. H. Green, and Rawls) are correct that\ncharacter is shaped by the institutions of political, economic, and\nfamily life, then becoming good will require access to the\nappropriate institutions. Yet this is not to suggest that becoming\ngood is out of our reach. It may be helpful here to recall\nRawls\u2019s description of a \u201crealistic utopia\u201d in\nThe Law of Peoples when, following Rousseau in The Social\nContract, he writes that just institutions take \u201cmen as\nthey are\u201d and \u201claws as they might be.\u201d (Rawls,\n1999b, 7) Our psychological natures and the institutions that promote\ngood qualities of character are, in his view and in the views of\nothers discussed throughout this entry, congruent.\n",
