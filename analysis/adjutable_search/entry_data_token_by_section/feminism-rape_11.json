    "main_text": "The Wrongs and Harms of Rape || War rape and genocidal rape\n4. Conclusion\n\nFeminist theorizing about rape draws on a rich tradition of feminist\nscholarship in many disciplines, as well as on women\u2019s insights\ninto their own rape experiences and on the knowledge gained through\ndecades of feminist anti-violence activism. As such theorizing\ncontinues to develop\u2014growing both more radical in its challenges\nto patriarchal social and sexual assumptions, and more global and\n intersectional[2]\n in its analysis\u2014it constitutes an essential support for\nfeminist movements against sexual violence.\n",
