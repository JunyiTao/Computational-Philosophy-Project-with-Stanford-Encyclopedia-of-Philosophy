The securest path of all, just as in the theory of\nnature, is this: One must assume certain experiences, explain their\nground through an hypothesis, then test this hypothesis against\nexperiences from a quite different species, and only assume those\nhypotheses to be general principles which have thus held their ground;\none must finally seek to explain these principles in the theory of\nnature through the nature of bodies and motion, but\nin aesthetics through the nature of the lower powers of our\nsoul.  (Review of Meier, pp. 197\u20138)\n\n\n\nYet the reference to the \u201clower powers of the soul\u201d in the\nfinal line of the quotation suggests that Mendelssohn will continue to\nwork within the general paradigm of Wolffian philosophy himself. He\ncertainly does, but what he aims to do is to show that the perfections\nthat can be realized in aesthetic experience are both more positive\nand more complicated than those recognized by\nBaumgarten. Mendelssohn\u2019s method allows him to recognize that all of\nour aesthetic experiences draw on a range of mental and even physical\nresources, and that because of this many aesthetic experiences can be\nunderstood only as \u201cmixed\u201d rather than simple\nfeelings. Mendelssohn\u2019s analysis of the complexity of aesthetic\nexperience places more emphasis on the powers of mind and body\ninvolved in such experience than on the objective perfections that art\nmay represent or nature contain. His account further prepares the\nground for the full-blown theory of aesthetic experience as based in a\nplay of our powers that will subsequently be achieved by Kant and\nSchiller. But in his emphasis on the role of the body as well as the\nmind in aesthetic experience, Mendelssohn goes beyond his\nsuccessors.\n\n\nMendelssohn followed his rabbi from Dessau to Berlin at the age of\nfourteen. At twenty-one, he became a tutor in the home of a Jewish\nsilk manufacturer, at twenty-five his accountant, subsequently his\nmanager, and finally a partner in the business, in which he would work\nfull-time for the rest of his life. But by twenty-five Mendelssohn had\nalso mastered not only literary German but Greek, Latin, French, and\nEnglish as well as a vast range of literature and philosophy in all\nthose languages. He had also become friends with the critic and\nplaywright Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and the writer and publisher\nFriedrich Nicolai, and begun an active publishing career. In 1755,\nbefore he turned twenty-six, Mendelssohn published Philosophical\nDialogues on the model of Shaftesbury, the epistolary On Sentiments,\nand, with Lessing, Pope, a Metaphysician! The next year he\npublished Thoughts on Probability and a translation of\nRousseau\u2019s second discourse On the Origins of\nInequality. From 1756 to 1759 he collaborated with Lessing and\nNicolai on the Library of Fine Sciences and Liberal Arts, for\nwhich he wrote two dozen reviews of new works in aesthetics and\nliterature, and from 1759 to 1765 he contributed nearly one hundred\nreviews to Nicolai\u2019s Letters concerning the newest\nLiterature, discussing works not only in aesthetics and\nliterature but also metaphysics, mathematics, natural science, and\npolitics (Gesammelte Schriften, vol. 5.1 (1991),\npp. 5\u2013676). In 1761 he published the first edition of\nhis Philosophical Writings, mostly on aesthetics, and in 1763\nhe took first place in a Prussian Academy of Sciences essay\ncompetition for an essay on Evidence in Metaphysical\nSciences, beating out the entry by Kant. But as a Jew, he was\ndenied entrance to the Academy by the \u201cenlightened\u201d\nFrederick the Great, even though he had the strong support of its\nmembers. In 1767, Mendelssohn published Phaedo: or on the\nImmortality of the Soul, loosely based on Plato\u2019s dialogue of the\nsame name, an immensely popular work. In the 1770s, after the onset of\na \u201cnervous debility\u201d that he would henceforth claim\nprevented him from serious philosophical work, Mendelssohn began a\ntranslation of the Pentatuech and Psalms into modern German (but\nprinted in Hebrew characters) that he hoped would preserve the Jewish\nreligion while simultaneously facilitating the assimilation of Jews\ninto German culture and society. His masterpiece Jerusalem, or on\nReligious Power and Judaism, in which he argued for the civil\nrights of the Jews by arguing that the state had no right to recognize\nany religion at all and therefore must allow all religions freedom\nfrom interference, was published in 1783. In 1785, he returned to\nphilosophy one last time with Morning Lessons, a magisterial\nsummary of his own version of Wolffianism. By this time, however, he\nwas caught up in a strenuous controversy with the fideist philosopher\nFriedrich Heinrich Jacobi over whether his lifelong friend Lessing had\nbeen a Spinozist. In the midst of this controversy he died of\nin January, 1786, at the age of fifty-six.\n\n\nMendelssohn worked within the framework of Wolffian metaphysics and\npsychology, and thus he accepted the definition of sensible perception\nas clear but confused cognition. He accepted Wolff\u2019s explanation that\npleasure arises in the sensible perception of perfection, but also\nBaumgarten\u2019s transformation of that formula into the explanation of\nbeauty as the perfection of sensible cognition: in Mendelssohn\u2019s\nterms, \u201cthe essence of the fine arts and sciences consists in an\nartful, sensibly perfect representation or in a sensible perfection\nrepresented by art\u201d (\u201cOn the Main Principles of the Fine\nArts and Sciences\u201d (1757), Philosophical Writings,\npp. 172\u20133). But Mendelssohn vigorously rejected any\ninterpretation of the Wolffian premise according to which the\nconfusion of sensible perception itself could be the source of our\npleasure in it. For Mendelssohn, any \u201cpure gratification of the\nsoul must be grounded in the positive powers of our soul and not in\nits incapacity, not in the limitation of those original powers\u201d\n(On Sentiments, Fourth Letter; Philosophical\nWritings, p. 19). Further, \u201cneither fully distinct nor\nfully obscure concepts are compatible with the feeling of\nbeauty\u201d: beauty requires that an object offer enough\n\u201cextensive clarity,\u201d that is, richness and variety, to\nstimulate us, but enough unity so that we can easily take it in as a\nwhole (On Sentiments, Third Letter, Philosophical\nWritings, pp. 14\u201315). Mendelssohn\u2019s explicit thesis is that\nwhile the parts of an object must be distinct enough to allow one to\nhave a sense of their variety but dense enough to allow one to grasp\nthem together with equilibrium and proportion, it is the latter that\nis the source of our pleasure.  It might seem a stretch to read him as\nalso suggesting that it is the play of the mind back and forth between\nits perception of the parts and its grasp of the whole that is\npleasant.  But he will argue that the exercise of various of our\npowers, indeed as we are about to see bodily as well as mental powers,\nis itself a perfection that we enjoy, so this might at least point\ntoward the idea that the source of pleasure in beauty is the free play\nof the those powers.\n\n\nWhile rejecting any interpretation of obscurity or confusion as itself\nthe source of our pleasure in beauty (On Sentiments, note\nh; Philosophical Writings, p. 79), Mendelssohn also rejects\nthe idea of the Abb\u00e9 Du Bos (and of Meier\u2019s theory of the emotions)\nthat the mere arousal of feelings as such is the aim of art\n(On Sentiments, Conclusion; Philosophical Writings,\np. 71), as well as the idea of Charles Batteux that \u201cthe\nimitation of nature is the general means by which the fine arts please\nus, and [that] it is possible to derive all particular rules of the\nfine arts and sciences from this single principle\u201d (\u201cOn\nthe Main Principles of the Fine Arts and\nSciences\u201d, Philosophical Writings, p. 170). Yet\nMendelssohn no more rejects the idea that works of art do arouse our\nemotions and that they are, at least in many cases, imitations of\nnature than he rejects the idea that the perception of perfection and\nthe perfection of perception is central to our experience of beauty\nand other aesthetic properties. So how does he fit all of these ideas\ntogether into his own distinctive theory?\n\n\nMendelssohn never presented his aesthetic theory in a full-length\ntreatise. His most systematic presentation, the 1757 essay \u201cOn\nthe Main Principles of the Fine Arts and Sciences,\u201d discusses\nonly three out of the four axes of potential perfection that he finds\nin the complete aesthetic experience. We therefore need to supplement\nwhat we can glean from this essay with suggestions from On\nSentiments and the Rhapsody, or addition to the Letters on\nSentiments that he added to his 1761 collection. The four axes\nthat Mendelssohn identifies are the perfection in the object of the\naesthetic experience, typically the perfection of what is depicted by\na work of art but not always, since some arts, such as music and\narchitecture, and all of nature are not mimetic at all; the perfection\nof our own perceptual capacities in the experience of an object, the\n\u201cperfection of sensible cognition\u201d that he adopted from\nBaumgarten; the perfection of our bodily condition that can\nbe produced through the effect of our mental condition on our body, a\ndimension lacking from all previous accounts in the German rationalist\ntradition but perhaps inspired by Mendelssohn\u2019s acquaintance with\nEdmund Burke\u2019s account of the physiology of our feelings of the\nbeautiful and the sublime (itself perhaps building upon the common\nproperty of David Hartley\u2019s 1749 Observations on Man); and\nfinally, the perfection of the artistry that has gone into the\nproduction of an object, whether human artistry in the case of a work\nof art or divine artistry in the case of the beauties of\nnature. Perfection along any of these axes is a potential source of\npleasure in the experience of an object, and the effect of these\nsources of pleasure can be additive, each increasing our pleasure in\nthe same object. But these multiple dimensions to our pleasure in\nobjects also create the possibility of the \u201cmixed\nemotions\u201d that we experience in the artistic representation of\nunpleasant or tragic objects, because in those cases our pleasure in\nthe mental activity stimulated by the work of art, the pleasant effect\nof that on the body, and our admiration of the artistry that has gone\ninto the object can outweigh any pain associated with the depicted\ncontent of the work.\n\n\nMendelssohn\u2019s characterization of the intrinsic perfection of objects\nin nature and thus of the objects depicted in representational art\nfollows in the path already marked out by Wolff: the perfection of an\nobject lies in the order, symmetry, and rational coherence of its\nparts, and its beauty lies in that perfection insofar as it can be\ngrasped in sensible cognition. Thus in On Sentiments\nMendelssohn writes that we call the structure of\nthe world beautiful in the proper sense of the term when the\nimagination orders its chief parts in as splendid a symmetry as that\nof the order that reason and perception teach us that they possess\noutside us. (On Sentiments, Third Letter; Philosophical\nWritings, p. 15)\n\n\nIn the case of natural objects, this order is\ncomprised by both the internal organization of an object to suit its\noverall goal and the part that the particular object plays in nature\nas a whole. In the \u201cMain Principles,\u201d Mendelssohn goes\nbeyond this formalistic characterization of perfection and offers a\nmore concrete list of the kinds of things that count as perfections\nin objects, whether objects in nature enjoyed in their own right or\nobjects in nature enjoyed through the artistic depiction of them,\nwhich provide \u201cthe first level of satisfaction and\ndissatisfaction which alternately accompany all our\nrepresentations.\u201d Here he says that\n\n\nEverything capable of being represented to the senses as a perfection\ncould also present an object of beauty. Belonging here are all the\nperfections of external forms, that is, the lines, surfaces, and\nbodies and their movements and changes; the harmony of the multiple\nsounds and colors; the order in the parts of a whole, their\nsimilarity, variety, and harmony; their transposition and\ntransformation into other forms; all the capabilities of our soul, all\nthe skills of our body. Even the perfections of our external state\n(under which honor, comfort, and riches are to be understood) cannot\nbe excepted from this if they are fit to be represented in a way that\nis apparent to the senses. (\u201cMain\nPrinciples\u201d: Philosophical Writings,\np. 172)\n\n\n\nWhen Mendelssohn refers to the capabilities of our soul and the skills\nof our body here, he is referring to them as objects for depiction or\ndescription in a work of art, thus as part of the content of works of\nart. This is how he fits into his model the representation of human\nintentions, actions, and responses to them, which are the subject\nmatter of most mimetic art.\n\n\nThe next axis of perfection that Mendelssohn considers is the state of\nour mind in response to perfection or imperfection in a real or\nrepresented object. His clearest treatment of this may come in\nthe Rhapsody, which begins by taking up the question of how\nwe can be \u201cpowerfully attracted to the representation\u201d of\nsomething unpleasant. Mendelssohn answers this question this by saying\nthat\n\n\nEach individual representation stands in a twofold relation.  It is\nrelated, at once, to the matter before it as its object (of which it\nis a picture or copy) and then to the soul or the thinking subject (of\nwhich it constitutes a determination). As a determination of the soul,\nmany a representation can have something pleasant about it although,\nas a picture of the object, it is accompanied by disapproval and a\nfeeling of repugnance. (Rhapsody; Philosophical\nWritings, p. 132)\n\n\n\nSeveral points about this passage need comment. First, while by\n\u201crepresentation\u201d (Vorstellung) here Mendelssohn\nmeans a mental state that represents something other than itself and\nnot an external object such as a painting or a poem that depicts or\ndescribes something, a mental representation can of course indirectly\nrepresent an external object that is not directly present to it but is\nindirectly presented to it by an external representation such as a\npainting or a poem which is its direct external object, and that is\nindeed how artistic representation typically works. Second, while\nMendelssohn here refers to a mental representation as a\n\u201cdetermination\u201d (Bestimmung) or property of the\nmind, his further discussion suggests that he is actually thinking of\nrepresentation as a kind of mental activity, an activity\ninvolving our capacities for both knowing and desiring, and that we\nenjoy representation because we enjoy mental activity. Thus he\ncontinues that while \u201celements of perfection\u201d in a thing\nare \u201csatisfying and comfortable to us\u201d while\n\u201celements of imperfection\u2026are perceived with\ndissatisfaction,\u201d\n\n\nIn relation to the thinking subject, the soul, on the other hand,\nperceiving and cognizing the features as well as testifying to\nenjoying them or not constitutes something actual\n[Sachliches] that is posited in the soul, an affirmative\ndetermination of the soul. Hence every representation, at least in\nrelation to the subject, as an affirmative predicate of the thinking\nentity, must have something about it that we like. For even the\npicture of the deficiency of the object, just like the expression of\ndiscontent with it, are not deficiencies on the part of the thinking\nentity, but rather affirmative and actual determinations of\nit\u2026.considered as a representation, a picture within us that\nengages the soul\u2019s capacities of knowing and desiring, the\nrepresentation of what is evil is itself an element of the soul\u2019s\nperfection and brings with it something quite pleasant that we by no\nmeans would prefer not to feel than to\nfeel. (Rhapsody; Philosophical Writings, pp.\n133\u20134)\n\n\n\nIt is striking how Mendelssohn writes here in gerundives and\ninfinitives rather than in substantives in order to convey a sense of\nmental activity: recognizing and approving or\neven disapproving are actions of the mind\nin knowing and desiring. We enjoy that mental\nactivity, even when it is stimulated by the representation of\nsomething of which we disapprove, and we enjoy the representation even\nof something evil as long as our pleasure in the activity of\nrepresenting is not overwhelmed by disapproval of the object of the\nrepresentation.\n\n\nThe contrast between perfection or imperfection in the content of a\nrepresentation and the enjoyable activity of the mind in representing\nthat content is the heart of Mendelssohn\u2019s theory, so we can interrupt\nour catalogue of all four of the axes of perfection that he recognizes\nfor some comments on this contrast. The first thing to be noticed is\nthat Mendelssohn here emphasizes the engagement of our powers of both\nknowing and desiring in aesthetic experience, not merely the power of\nknowing. This gives him room to add an emphasis on our enjoyment of\nthe arousal of our emotions to Baumgarten\u2019s emphasis on our enjoyment\nof the perfection of sensible cognition. Now, as we saw, Baumgarten in\nfact made room for this dimension of aesthetic experience in his\nearly Meditations on Poetry, even though he did not take it\nup again in the Aesthetica, and Meier emphasized it in\nseveral of his works. But Mendelssohn adds a crucial point here,\nleading to a fundamental revision in the significance of artistic\nimitation: in order for us to enjoy the mixed emotions in a pleasing\nrepresentation of something that is objectively displeasing, our sense\nof the difference between the represented content and our act\nof representing it cannot be allowed to collapse, and the r\u00f4le of\nartistic imitation is precisely to create enough distance\nbetween our representation and its object to allow us to enjoy the\nrepresentation rather than to collapse that space by creating\nthe illusion that we are in the actual presence of the\ndepicted object. Mendelssohn writes,\nIf the objects gets too close to us, if we regard\nit as a part of us or even as ourselves, the pleasant character of the\nrepresentation completely disappears, and the relation to the subject\nimmediately becomes an unpleasant relation to us since here subject\nand object collapse, as it were, into one\nanother. (Rhapsody; Philosophical Writings, p.  134)\n\n\nHe then says that a\nmeans of rendering the most terrifying events\npleasant to gentle minds is the imitation by art, on the stage, on the\ncanvas, and in marble, since an inner consciousness that we have an\nimitation and nothing genuine before our eyes moderates the strength\nof the objective disgust and, as it were, elevates the subjective side\nof the representation. (Rhapsody; Philosophical\nWritings, p. 138)\n\n\nThus, contrary to Wolff, Mendelssohn does not\nsuppose that what we enjoy in imitation is accuracy of representation\ntaken to the point of illusion, but rather the room for the experience\nof our own mental activity that the knowledge that the depicted object\nis only being imitated allows.\n\n\nIn fact, Mendelssohn\u2019s analysis of our mixed emotions in the\nexperience of tragedy is even more subtle than this, for a further\naspect of it is that our knowledge that we are experiencing\nrepresented rather than real people allows us to enjoy sympathy with\nthe perfections of the noble characters who are depicted rather than\npity at their weaknesses or at the fate that overcomes them. But\nrather than pursuing this, I want to make to make one further point\nabout Mendelssohn\u2019s general account of our enjoyment of the engagement\nof our powers of knowing and desiring. This explanation of a\nfundamental source of aesthetic pleasure as arising from the\nengagement of those two powers might seem to conflict with\nMendelssohn\u2019s influential ascription of aesthetic pleasure to\na third faculty, the \u201cfaculty of approval,\u201d\ndistinguished from both the \u201cfaculty of cognition\u201d and the\n\u201cfaculty of desire.\u201d Mendelssohn introduces this third\nfaculty in the Morning Lessons, a quarter-century after his\nearly writings on aesthetics. There he says that\n\n\nOne usually divides the faculties of the soul into the faculty of\ncognition and the faculty of desire, and assigns the sentiment of\npleasure and displeasure to the faculty of desire. But it seems to me\nthat between knowing and desiring lies the approving, the assent, the\nsatisfaction of the soul, which is actually quite remote from\ndesire. We contemplate the beauty of nature and of art, without the\nleast arousal of desire, with gratification and satisfaction.  It\nseems to be a particular mark of beauty that we contemplate it with\nquiet satisfaction; that it pleases, even if we do not possess it, and\nthat is remote from the urge to possess it. (Morgenstunden,\nLesson VII, p. 70)\n\n\n\nMendelssohn\u2019s introduction of a faculty of approval in 1785 may have\nbeen influential for Kant\u2019s elevation of judgment to a faculty on a\npar with understanding and reason, signaled in his letter of December\n25, 1787, to Karl Leonhard Reinhold, a decisive step in the genesis of\nthe third critique.  But as far as Mendelssohn is concerned, his\nexplanation of the faculty of approval shows that his basic theory has\nnot changed. By introducing this faculty, he wants to emphasize that\nthe experience of beauty or other aesthetic qualities is not actual\nknowledge, nor does it lead to specific desires and actions (except\nperhaps the desire to be able to continue contemplating an object\nalready found to have been beautiful). But what satisfies the faculty\nof approval is still the activity of the other mental powers. Thus\nMendelssohn writes, first with reference to the power of cognition but\nthen with reference to desire as well, that\nWe can consider the cognition of the soul in\ndifferent respects; either in so far as it is true or false, which I\ncall the material aspect in cognition; or in so far as arouses\npleasure or displeasure, has as its consequence the approval or\ndisapproval of the soul, and this can be called the formal aspect in\ncognition.\n\n\nAnd he explains the latter aspect precisely in\nterms of mental activity:\n\n\nEvery concept, in so far as it is merely thinkable, has something that\npleases the soul, that occupies its activity, and is thus cognized by\nit with satisfaction and approval\u2026.where the soul finds more\nsatisfaction in one concept than in another, more agreeable\noccupation, then can it prefer the former to the latter. In this\ncomparison and in the preference that we give to an object consists\nthe essence of the beautiful and the ugly, the good and the evil, the\nperfect and the imperfect. What we cognize as the best in this\ncomparison works on our faculty of desire and stimulates it, where it\nfinds no resistance, to activity. This is the side on which the\nfaculty of approval touches demand or desire. (Morgenstunden,\nLesson VII, pp. 72\u20133)\n\n\n\nOrdinarily, the faculty of cognition aims at truth, and the faculty of\ndesire aims at action. The faculty of approval, however, aims just for\nthe pleasing activity of the other two faculties without their usual\nresults. The faculty of approval should be distinguished from the\nfaculties of cognition and desire, since it does not aim at the same\nresults they do. But it is itself satisfied by creations that set\nthose faculties into an \u201cagreeable play.\u201d This is not a\nbreach with Mendelssohn\u2019s earlier doctrine, but an explanation of\nit. Mendelssohn\u2019s explicit introduction of the concept of play here,\nfinally, may be just as influential for the development of Kant\u2019s\naesthetics as is his insistence that the faculty of approval does not\nlead to actual knowledge or actual desire.\n\n\nIn the Morning Lessons Mendelssohn does not emphasize that\nthe free play of the mind has a pleasing effect on the body, but he\ndoes in his earlier writings, so let us now return to this third item\nin Mendelssohn\u2019s catalogue of the axes of perfection in aesthetic\nexperience. This is the effect of the activity of the mind in\naesthetic experience on the state of the body, a point that\nMendelssohn emphasizes in On Sentiments and\nthe Rhapsody although not in the essay on the \u201cMain\nPrinciples.\u201d Mendelssohn says that if\neach sensible rapture, each improved condition of\nthe state of our body, fills the soul with the sensible representation\nof a perfection, then every sensible representation must also, in\nturn, bring with it some well-being of the body\u2026And in this way\na pleasant emotion [Affekt] arises.\n\n\nHe distinguishes between a \u201csensible\nrapture\u201d (sinnliche Wollust) and an emotion because the\nformer begins in a part of a body, that is, with an actual external\nperception, while the latter \u201carises in the brain itself,\u201d\nbut in either case the feeling of the pleasure \u201carrange[s] the\nfibers of the brain into an appropriate tone, employing them without\nfatiguing them,\u201d and then \u201cThe brain communicates this\nharmonious tension to nerves of the other parts of the body and the\nbody becomes comfortable\u201d (On Sentiments, Twelfth\nLetter; Philosophical Writings, p. 53). In other words,\nalthough as a rationalist metaphysician Mendelssohn maintains the\nformal distinction between the mind and the body (the mind is simple\nand indivisible, while body is essentially divisible), as a\npsychologist and aesthetician he nevertheless sees them as in the most\nintimate interaction, with the perception of harmony by the body\ninfusing the mind with a pleasant sense of harmony that then further\nstimulates the harmonious condition of the body.\n\n\nFinally, the \u201cMain Principles\u201d introduce a fourth source\nof perfection and therefore pleasure in the aesthetic experience,\nnamely our appreciation of the artistry that is manifested in the\nproduction of a beautiful object. In explaining this source of\npleasure, Mendelssohn also makes another revision to the traditional\ntheory that it is resemblance alone that is the source of our pleasure\nin imitation, because resemblance is easily produced by means far less\ncomplex and admirable than all of the faculties that go into\nartistry\u2014a point that Plato had already made when he had\nSocrates argue that if it is mere imitation that the painter were\nafter, he could just go around with a mirror\n(Plato, Republic, Book X, 596d\u2013e):\n\n\nAll works of art are visible imprints of the artist\u2019s abilities which,\nso to speak, put his entire soul on display and make it known to\nus. This perfection of spirit arouses an uncommonly greater pleasure\nthan mere similarity, because it is more worthy and far more complex\nthan similarity. It is all the more worthy the more that the\nperfection of rational beings is elevated above the perfection of\nlifeless things, and also more complex because many abilities of the\nsoul and often diverse skills of the external limbs as well are\nrequired for a beautiful imitation. We find more to admire in a rose\nby Huysum than in the image that every river can reflect of\nthis queen of the flowers; and the most enchanting landscape in\na camera obscura does not charm us as much as it can through\nthe brush of a great landscape painter. (\u201cMain\nPrinciples\u201d; Philosophical Writings,\np. 174)\n\n\n\nMendelssohn explicitly recognizes the physical skills as well as the\nmental powers of the artist as among the perfections that we\nindirectly admire in admiring the work of art; this is another example\nof his recognition of the close connection between mind and body in\nspite of their metaphysical distinction. He also stresses the\nsuperiority of artistic representation over the mere imitation of\nnature by observing that the artist can create \u201cideal\nbeauty\u201d by gathering\ntogether in a single viewpoint what nature has\ndiffusely strewn among various objects, forming for himself a whole from this\nand taking the trouble to represent it just as nature would have\nrepresented it if the beauty of this limited object had been its sole\npurpose. (\u201cMain Principles\u201d; Philosophical\nWritings, p. 176)\n\n\n\nHowever, although human artistry may concentrate beauty more than\nnature does, that hardly means that artistic beauty is in all regards\nsuperior to natural beauty. Mendelssohn concludes the paragraph just\ncited by saying that \u201cthe most perfect, ideal beauty\u2026is\nto be encountered nowhere in nature other than in the whole and is\nperhaps never fully to be attained in the works of art.\u201d The beauty of nature as a whole exceeds the beauty of any work of\nart, and accordingly our admiration for the skill and genius of any\nhuman artist must be exceeded by our admiration for and pleasure in\nthe artistry that lies behind nature as a whole.\n\n\nMendelssohn concludes the essay on the \u201cMain Principles of the\nFine Arts and Sciences\u201d with a brief but pregnant division of\nthe arts. The basis of his division is a distinction between\n\u201cnatural\u201d and \u201carbitrary\u201d signs, which has\nprecedents in Du Bos, in Leibniz and Wolff, and beyond all of them in\nSt. Augustine. Signs are natural \u201cif the combination of the\nsubject matter signified is grounded in the very properties of what is\ndesignated,\u201d as smoke is a natural product of fire or \u201cThe\npassions are, by their very nature, connected with certain movements\nin our limbs as well as with certain sounds and gestures\u201d\n(\u201cMain Principles\u201d; Philosophical Writings, p.\n177). Signs are arbitrary that \u201cby their very nature have\nnothing in common with the designated subject matter, but have\nnevertheless been arbitrarily assumed as signs for it,\u201d such as\nthe \u201carticulated sounds of all languages, the letters, the\nhieroglyphic signs of the ancients, and some allegorical images\u201d\n(\u201cMain Principles\u201d; Philosophical Writings, pp.\n177\u20138). The arbitrary signs could also be called\nconventional. Mendelssohn\u2019s chief distinction is then between those\narts that convey their content by artificial signs, namely poetry and\nrhetoric, and those arts that employ natural signs, which convey both\nreference to content and the expression of feeling through natural\nsigns and do \u201cnot presuppose anything arbitrary in order to be\nunderstood,\u201d namely painting, sculpture, music, dance, and even\narchitecture insofar as it conveys any meaning and expression. In\nfact, Mendelssohn distinguishes between the fine arts and the\nbeautiful sciences, or between beaux arts and belles\nlettres, on this basis: the fine arts employ natural signs, and\nthe beautiful sciences or belles lettres employ arbitrary or\nconventional signs (\u201cMain Principles\u201d; Philosophical\nWritings, pp. 178\u20139). Among the belles lettres,\npoetry and rhetoric are distinguished by the fact that \u201cThe\nmain, ultimate purpose of poetry is to please by means of a sensibly\nperfect discourse, while that of rhetoric is to persuade by means of a\nsensibly perfect discourse.\u201d Mendelssohn does not explain why\nthe fact that poetry and rhetoric employ artificial rather than\nnatural signs entitles them to be called sciences rather than arts;\nperhaps what he has in mind is that since the meanings of arbitrary\nsigns can be codified, there is more room for precision in the\ninterpretation of poetry and rhetoric than there is in the various\nfine arts (with the exception of their allegorical or iconographical\naspects, which as Mendelssohn has suggested are more like arbitrary\nthan natural signs). In the case of rhetoric, moreover, there was a\nlong tradition going back to antiquity of formulating rules for how\npersuasion can be achieved, and perhaps this made it seem like more of\na science than an art to Mendelssohn.\n\n\nBe this as it may, the main point of Mendelssohn\u2019s distinction is that\nbecause its signs are arbitrary and can therefore be associated with\nany conceivable content, \u201cthe poet can express everything of\nwhich our soul can have a clear concept,\u201d while the arts that\nemploy natural signs are limited to the expression of those ideas and\nemotions the natural signs for which can be replicated in their\nspecific media; each of these arts \u201cmust content itself with\nthat portion of natural signs that it can express by means of the\nsenses,\u201d or more precisely by means of its particular way of\nengaging the senses. For example, \u201cMusic, the expression of\nwhich takes place by means of inarticulate sounds,\u201d although it\ncan express both the general ideas of harmony and all of the\nparticular \u201cinclinations and passions of the human soul which\ntend to make themselves known by means of sounds,\u201d cannot\npossibly indicate particular concepts of objects such as \u201cthe\nconcept of a rose, a poplar tree, and so on, just as it is impossible\nfor painting to represent a musical chord to us\u201d (\u201cMain\nPrinciples\u201d; Philosophical Writings, pp. 178\u20139).\nA similar point would be made a century later by the music critic\nEduard Hanslick.\n\n\nMendelssohn next assumes that only hearing and sight can convey\nnatural signs, and then observes that\nthe natural signs that affect the sense of sight\ncan be represented either successively or alongside one another, that\nis to say, they can express beauty either through movement or through\nforms. (\u201cMain Principles\u201d; Philosophical\nWritings, p. 179)\n\n\nThe art of dance employs movements that naturally\nexpress human feelings and emotions, while the arts of painting and\nsculpture must \u201cexpress beauties that are alongside one\nanother\u201d through line, color, and shape. This leads Mendelssohn\nto the point that although works of music, dance, and for that matter\npoetry themselves take place through a succession of moments and can\nthereby convey a succession of movements, painting and sculpture can\nrepresent only a single moment in the history of their objects. The\npainter and sculptor must therefore\n\n\nchoose the instant that is most favorable to their purpose.  They must\nassemble the entire action into a single perspective and divide it up\nwith a great deal of understanding. In this instant everything must be\nrich in thoughts and so full of meaning that every accompanying\nconcept makes its own contribution to the required meaning. When we\nview such a painting [or sculpture] with due attention, our senses are\nall at once inspired, all the abilities of our soul suddenly\nenlivened, and the imagination can from the present infer the past and\nreliably anticipate the future. (\u201cMain\nPrinciples\u201d; Philosophical Writings,\npp. 180\u20131)\n\n\n\nMendelssohn\u2019s thesis that the visual arts must convey all of their\ncontent through their representation of an object at a single moment\nwhile other arts can represent movements and actions in, as we would\nsay, real time, would be used as a premise in a famous controversy\nbetween his friend Lessing and the renowned historian of ancient art\nJohann Joachim Winckelmann, to which we will turn in a moment. But\nbefore doing so, we must complete our survey of Mendelssohn\u2019s\naesthetics with a comment on his discussion of the sublime.\n\n\nMendelssohn was instrumental in introducing the topic of the sublime\ninto German aesthetics, publishing a lengthy review of Burke\u2019s book on\nthe beautiful and the sublime in 1758, just a year after it appeared\nin England (reprinted in Mendelssohn, Gesammelte Schriften,\nvolume 4, pp. 216\u201336), as well as an essay \u201cOn the Sublime\nand Na\u00efve in the Fine Sciences\u201d in the same year. In the latter\nessay, Mendelssohn makes a number of points that will become central\nto the subsequent German discussion of the sublime, especially in\nKant. His premise, not surprisingly, is that \u201cThe sentiment\nproduced by the sublime is a composite one\u201d (\u201cOn the\nSublime and the Na\u00efve in the Fine Sciences\u201d; Philosophical\nWritings, p. 195). For one thing, it may be produced by the\nperception or thought of an \u201cimmensity of extended\nmagnitude\u201d or of an \u201cimmensity of strength or unextended\nmagnitude\u201d (\u201cThe Sublime and\nNa\u00efve\u201d; Philosophical Writings, p. 194)\u2014by the\nsight, image, or thought of something vastly big or of something\nvastly powerful.\n This distinction anticipates Kant\u2019s subsequent\ndistinction between the \u201cmathematical\u201d and the\n\u201cdynamical\u201d sublime, and while it was not uncommon in\nBritish discussions of the sublime, Mendelssohn may have been Kant\u2019s\nsource for it. Mendelssohn then says that either immensity of size or\nimmensity of strength first \u201ccaptures our attention\u201d and\n\u201carouses a sweet shudder that rushes through every fiber of our\nbeing\u2026giving wings to the imagination to press further and\nfurther without stopping.\u201d \u201cAll these sentiments blend\ntogether in the soul,\u201d becoming \u201ca single phenomenon which\nwe call awe\u201d (loc. cit.).  But the feeling of awe at\nimmensity does not yet complete the complex experience of the sublime;\nfor that, there must also be an element of admiration at a\nperfection\u2014for remember that Mendelssohn\u2019s project is still to\nground all aesthetic experience on the underlying principle of\npleasure in perfection. So the immensity which inspires us with awe\nmust also be interpreted as a manifestation of perfection. Mendelssohn\nthen invokes the same distinction he employed in his discussion of\nartistry. The immensity which fills us with awe may be either a\nproduct of divine artistry, in which case\nthe properties of the Supreme Being which we\nrecognize in his works inspire the most ecstatic awe and admiration\nbecause they surpass everything that we can conceive as enormous,\nperfect, or sublime,\n\n\nor it can be due to human artistry. In that case\nwe may not find the represented object so extraordinary but feel with\npleasure how \u201cthe artist possesses the skill of elevating its\nproperties and showing them in an uncommon light,\u201d or\nalternatively we may be awed by both the represented object and the\ndivine artistry that lies behind it and by the \u201cgreat wit,\ngenius, imagination, and capacities of the soul\u201d of the human\nartist who produces the image of the work of divine artistry.\nWhat especially pleases us in the case of art,\nconsidered as art, is the reference to the spiritual gifts of the\nartist which make themselves visibly known. If they bear the\ncharacteristics of an uncommon genius\u2026then they inspire awe on\nour part. (\u201cThe Sublime and Na\u00efve\u201d; Philosophical\nWritings, pp. 196\u20137)\n\n\n\nWe may now turn to the famous controversy between Lessing and\nWinckelmann, built upon Mendelssohn\u2019s distinction between the arts of\nform and the arts of movement.\n",
