    "main_text": "The Naturalist Turn || The Second Person and Person Model Theory\n3.2 The Second Person and Person Model Theory\n\nOver the years theory-theory and simulation theory have moved closer\ntowards each other, giving rise to various hybrid accounts of how it\nis that we attribute minds to others. But there are those who\nchallenge both theories and any hybrid versions that they have\nspawned. One such challenge arises from Gallagher & Zahavi 2008\nwho urge that we cast aside both third-person (theory) and\nfirst-person (simulation) approaches, and concentrate instead on\nsecond-person interaction. (In its development in Gallagher\u2019s\nwork, this approach has come to be known as \u201cinteraction\ntheory\u201d.) Influenced by work in phenomenology and embodied\ncognition, Gallagher and Zahavi propose that our attribution of mental\nstates to others is the result of perception of and reaction to\nbehavior understood as expressive of mental life. Furthermore, they\nsuggest that the activation of mirror neurons be understood as serving\naction or response preparation (rather than as supporting simulation,\ncf.\n \u00a73.1).\n Drawing on the work of developmental psychologists such as Meltzoff,\nTrevarthen, and Hobson, they identify two forms of intersubjectivity:\na primary form identifiable in early infancy that involves a\ndifferential response to persons and inanimate objects; and a\nsecondary form when the behavior of persons is interpreted \u201cin\nterms of their goals and intentions set in contextualized\nsituations\u201d (Gallagher & Zahavi 2008: 190). In addition to\nprimary and secondary intersubjectivity, and at the point when the\nchild has language, it is suggested that a more nuanced way of\nunderstanding others becomes possible through the development of\ncommunicative and narrative practices (Hutto 2008; Gallagher &\nHutto 2008). Gallagher and Zahavi reject inferential accounts of how\nwe know others in favor of a direct perceptual one, and they\nunderstand behavior (e.g., gesture, facial expressions, contextualized\nactions) to be constitutive of mental life. Importantly, they point\nout that one shouldn\u2019t conceive of interpersonal understanding\nas if it was merely and primarily a question of bridging the gap\nbetween two isolated subjects. Interpersonal understanding occurs in a\ncontext and through \u201cour shared engagement in the common\nworld\u201d (Gallagher & Zahavi 2008: 190; cf. Gurwitsch 1977\n[1979]).\n\nThis work aims to move us away from an overly-intellectualized way of\nthinking of other minds and to turn our attention to the world that we\nlive and act in with others. The emphasis here is less on individual\nbeliefs and desires than in shared intentions and goals. As Gallagher\nsays in one place, \u201csocial cognition is often nothing more than\n\u2026 social interaction\u201d (2008: 541).\n\nInteraction theory can be seen as an extension of enactivist theories\nof perception that understand perception as a highly complex\naction-oriented phenomenon, incorporating both meaning and emotion: to\nsee an object is to see it as affording me opportunity for action, and\nthis opportunity is taken to be part of how I make sense of the world\nand what gives the world value for me (cf. Clarke, Noe, Varela et\nal). The extension of this idea allows that social interactions\nalso constitute for me \u201cnovel domains of possibilities for sense\nmaking\u201d (De Jaegher 2009). To see the other person is to see her\nas affording interaction; in this regard, direct perception is direct\nenactive perception. Interactionist theorists have suggested concrete\nproposals for empirical work in psychology and neuroscience in the\nhopes of moving this research away from what they see as individualism\nand methodological solipsism (De Jaegher, DiPaulo, & Gallagher\n2010). Rather than taking individual agents to be constitutive of\nsocial interaction, these interaction theorists take them to be\nconstituted by their interaction with others.\n\nPerson model theory challenges theory-theory (TT) and simulation\ntheory (ST)\u2014as well as interaction theory (IT; Newen 2015, Newen\n& Schlicht 2009). Person model theory finds certain limitations in\neach of the theories that it opposes. In the place of the two forms of\nintersubjectivity recommended by Gallagher and Zahavi, person theory\nsuggests that the infant works with a \u201cnon-conceptual\nperson-schema\u201d which develops\u2014through the combined work of\nobservation and narrative\u2014into \u201cconceptualized\nperson-images\u201d. Thus, it is proposed that the understanding of\npersons is a step-by-step process of enrichment, central to which is\nthe acceptance of a multiplicity of strategies (TT, ST, and IT among\nthem). Which strategy is deployed is dependent upon such things as\ncontext, how similar or different the other is from oneself, whether\nthe understanding is of an emotion or a propositional attitude, and\nthe complexity of the mental state. The idea of the deployment of a\nmultiplicity of strategies is not unique to Person Theory. Gallagher\nand Fiebich (2019) argue for what they call a \u201cpluralist\napproach\u201d to the understanding of others, drawing on inference,\nsimulation, direct perception, and/or interaction\u2014depending on\nthe situation (cf. Nichols & Stich 2003). What this work\nhighlights is how much may be involved when it comes to understanding\nothers.\n\nIt is possible to see a connection between ideas that are fundamental\nto interaction theory (which brings together work from phenomenology\nand embodied cognition) and some ideas that can be found in the work\nof Stanley Cavell (which aims to interpret and develop the work of\nAustin and Wittgenstein, as well as integrating work from\nphenomenology with work in analytic philosophy). Where Gallagher and\nZahavi emphasize social interaction, Cavell writes of a duality in the\nproblem of other minds. Cavell understands this duality to be what the\nradical Cartesian sceptic overlooks when she presses her question\nabout our knowledge of the mind of another. What we must appreciate,\naccording to Cavell, is that in so far as there is a problem about how\nI know you, there is equally a problem about how you know me (herein\nlies the duality in the problem). Cavell holds that appreciating this\nduality will help us to see the error of the sceptic\u2019s ways. The\nsceptic considers only one side of the problem and insists that we\nsuffer from an epistemological lack. Cavell draws attention to the\nside of the problem that the sceptic misses and finds in this a fear\non our part of not being understood by another. It is this fear that\ngets misunderstood by the sceptic and turned into a darkness which is\nprojected on to the other. Cavell thinks we must resist this\nprojection and understand that acknowledgment by another is made\npossible by expression on my part. Expression is what makes\nacknowledgement possible. We must take responsibility to give\nexpression to our mental states which can in turn be acknowledged by\nothers. Importantly, for Cavell acknowledgement is not the same as\nknowledge. While the latter is a form of cognition, the forner is to\nbe understood as behaviour oriented towards another (for more on the\nduality that Cavell finds in the problem of other minds see Avramides,\nforthcoming). According to Cavell, I must take responsibility for\nacknowledging the humanity in others, which acknowledgement is evident\nin the way I behave towards them.\n",
