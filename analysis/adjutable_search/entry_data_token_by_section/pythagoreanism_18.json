    "main_text": "Pythagoreanism in the Middle Ages and Renaissance || Boethius/Nicomachus, Calcidius, Macrobius and the Middle Ages\n5.1 Boethius/Nicomachus, Calcidius, Macrobius and the Middle Ages\n\nIn the Middle Ages Pythagoras and Pythagorean philosophy were regarded\nas the height of Greek philosophical achievement, although, somewhat\nparadoxically Pythagoreanism was not still an active philosophy as\nwere Platonism and Aristotelianism but instead belonged to an\n\u201cimagined history\u201d of philosophy (Hicks 2014, 420). The\nview of Pythagoreanism in the Middle Ages was heavily determined by\nthree late ancient Latin writers: Calcidius, Macrobius and Boethius.\nIt was in particular the mathematical Pythagoreanism of Nicomachus as\ntransmitted by Boethius that determined the medieval picture of\nPythagoras. In ethics, Christians were able to embrace some\nPythagorean maxims such as the principle labeled Pythagorean by\nBoethius: \u201cFollow God\u201d (Consolation of Philosophy\n1.4). Some attention was also paid to other Pythagorean\nsymbola (see section 5.2 below). On the other hand the\ndoctrine of metempsychosis with its idea that human beings were born\nagain as animals was repugnant to Christian doctrine (John of\nSalisbury, Policraticus 7.10). When it comes to\nPythagoras\u2019 life it is crucial to recognize that\nIamblichus\u2019 and Porphyry\u2019s lives of Pythagoras were not\nknown in the Middle Ages so that Pythagoras\u2019 activities were\nmostly known through passages from classical authors and church\nfathers (Hicks 2014, 421). Pythagoras was included in medieval\nencyclopedic works and was given particularly thorough treatment by\nVincent of Beauvais (before 1200\u20131264) in his Speculum\nhistoriale (3.24\u201326), by John of Wales (fl.\n1260\u20131283) in Compendiloquium (3.6.2) and in The\nLives and Habits of the Philosophers ascribed to, but probably\nnot actually composed by, Walter Burley (1275\u20131344; see Riedweg\n2005, 129; Heninger 1974, 47; Hicks 2014, 421). \n\nThe most influential texts for the conception of Pythagoras in the\nLatin Middle Ages and early Renaissance were Boethius\u2019\n(480\u2013524 CE) De Institutione Arithmetica and De\nInstitutione Musica, which are virtually translations of the\nNeopythagorean Nicomachus\u2019 (second century CE) Introduction\nto Arithmetic and Introduction to Music (this larger\nwork is now lost, but a smaller Handbook of Harmonics\nsurvives). Boethius followed Nicomachus\u2019 classification of four\nmathematical sciences depending on the nature of their objects\n(arithmetic deals with multitude in itself, music with relative\nmultitude, geometry with unmoving magnitudes and astronomy with\nmagnitude in motion). Boethius introduced the term\nquadrivium, \u201cfourfold road\u201d to understanding, to\nrefer to these four sciences. In music theory, Boethius presents the\nPythagoreans as taking a middle position, which gives a role in\nharmonics to both reason and perception. His presentation of the\nPythagorean position was central to music theory for over a thousand\nyears (Hicks 2014, 424). Boethius recounts the apocryphal story of\nPythagoras\u2019 discovery in a blacksmith\u2019s shop of the ratios\nthat govern the concordant intervals (Mus. I 10). \n\nThe medieval picture of Pythagoras as a natural philosopher and the\nmedieval understanding of his theory of the nature of the soul were\nheavily influenced by the Latin commentary on Plato\u2019s\nTimaeus by Calcidius (4th century CE) and the Commentary\non the Dream of Scipio by Macrobius (5th century CE). Calcidius\nregarded Plato\u2019s Timaeus as a heavily Pythagorean\ndocument. Under the influence of the Neopythagorean Numenius,\nCalcidius assigned to Pythagoras the view that god was unity and\nmatter duality (Hicks 2014, 429). Calcidius describes Plato\u2019s\nWorld-Soul in a way that highlights its harmonic structure and\nMacrobius explicitly ascribes to Pythagoras the view that the soul is\na harmony (Commentary on the Dream of Scipio 1.14.19). The\ndoctrine of the harmony of the spheres, which portrays the cosmos as a\nharmony that is expressed in the music made by the revolutions of the\nplanets, follows from the numerical structure of the World-Soul and\nwas also assigned to Pythagoras by Calcidius. Most medieval\nNeoplatonic cosmoligies adopted the doctrine, but the reintroduction\nof Aristotle\u2019s criticism of it in the thirteenth century caused\nmany to abandon the theory until it was revived in the Renaissance by\nFicino (Hicks 2014, 434). Later, Shakespeare refers to the doctrine\nmemorably in The Merchant of Venice (V i. 54\u201365).\nCicero\u2019s presentation of it in the Dream of Scipio was\nalso influential in the Renaissance (Heninger 1974, 3).\n\nPythagorean influence also appeared at less elevated levels of\nmedieval culture. A fourteenth-century manual for preachers, which\ncontained lore about the natural world and is known as The Light\nof the Soul, ascribes a series of odd observations about nature\nto Archita Tharentinus, who is presumably intended to be the fourth\ncentury BCE Pythagorean, Archytas of Tarentum. These are mostly cited\nfrom a book, which was evidently forged in Archytas\u2019 name and\nknown as On Events in Nature. Some of the observations are\nplausible enough, e.g., that a person at the bottom of a well sees\nstars in the middle of the day, others more puzzling, e.g., that a\ndying man emits fiery rays from his eyes at death, while still others\nmay have connections to magic, e.g., \u201cif someone looks at a\nmirror, before which a white flower has been placed, he cries.\u201d\nSome magical lore ascribed to an Architas is also found in the\nthirteenth-century Marvels of the World (ps.-Albertus\nMagnus), e.g., \u201cif the wax of the left ear of a dog be taken and\nhung on people with periodic fever, it is beneficial\u2026\u201d\nThese texts seem to continue the connection between Pythagoreanism and\nmagic, which developed in the third and second centuries BCE, and is\nprominent in Rome during the first-century BCE (see above section\n4.5).\n",
