The Uses of The Moral/Conventional Task in Philosophy\n\nSusan Dwyer was the pioneer in introducing Turiel\u2019s work to\nphilosophers. In her 1999 paper, \u201cMoral Competence\u201d, she\nproposed an analogy between the psychological mechanisms underlying\nmoral competence and Chomsky\u2019s account of the psychological\nmechanisms underlying linguistic competence. The universality of the\nmoral/conventional distinction and the fact that it emerges very early\nin development, Dwyer argues, are both best explained by the\nhypothesis that \u201cchildren come equipped with something akin to a\nUniversal Moral Grammar\u201d (Dwyer 1999: 169). Prior to\nDwyer\u2019s paper, references to Turiel and other social domain\ntheorists were infrequent in the philosophical literature, and we know\nof no substantive discussions of the philosophical implications of\ntheir findings. But that soon changed.\n\nAs we saw in\n Section 9,\n Turiel\u2019s work played an important role in Nichols\u2019 (2002)\nelaboration and defense of his version of moral sentimentalism. In\nanother pair of publications (Nichols 2004: Ch. 4; 2007) Nichols\ninvoked the work of the social domain theorists (Turiel 1983; Smetana\n1989, 1993; Tisak 1995) to mount an argument against what he took,\nplausibly enough, to be the most visible and carefully developed\nalternative version of sentimentalism, developed by Alan Gibbard\n(1990). The problem with Gibbard\u2019s theory, Nichols maintains, is\nthat it is \u201cseriously overintellectualized\u201d and\n\u201ctoo ingenious to be a plausible account of normal\nmoral judgment\u201d (Nichols 2007: 261 & 259). On\nGibbard\u2019s account,\n\n\nwhat a person does is morally wrong if and only if it is\nrational for him to feel guilty for doing it and for others to resent\nhim for doing it. (Gibbard 1990: 42, quoted in Nichols 2007: 258)\n\n\nBut, Nichols argues,\n\n\nif moral judgments are judgments of the appropriateness of guilt, then\nan individual cannot have the capacity to make moral judgments\nunless she also has the capacity to make judgments about the\nappropriateness of guilt. (Nichols 2007: 259, italics in the\noriginal)\n\n\nand developmental psychologists tell us that \u201cchildren\ndon\u2019t understand complex emotions like guilt \u2026 until\naround age 7\u201d (Nichols 2007: 261). However, according to\nNichols, children make moral judgments much earlier. The crucial step\nin Nichols\u2019 argument for this latter claim is that \u201ca\nbasic capacity for moral judgment is reflected by passing the\nmoral/conventional task\u201d (2004: 89). And, as Turiel and his\ncolleagues have repeatedly shown, children succeed at the\nmoral/conventional task\u2014they give typical adult responses to\nschoolyard examples of moral and conventional transgressions\u2014by\nthe age of four or earlier. Since four year-olds can make moral\njudgments but don\u2019t understand guilt, Nichols concludes that\nGibbard\u2019s version of sentimentalism is incompatible with the\nempirical\n facts.[25]\n\nOver the last two decades, discussion of the work of social domain\ntheorists became substantially more common in the philosophical\nliterature. Joseph Heath offers an intriguing explanation for some of\nthe philosophical interest in this work. It is, he maintains,\nmotivated by the widespread resistance, among moral philosophers,\n\u201cto the idea that morality could simply be a part of\nculture, because \u2026 many elements of culture vary\nenormously from place to place\u2026\u201d (2017: 277). These\nphilosophers, Heath contends,\n\n\nare inclined to think that what is morally acceptable or unacceptable\nis universal and invariant, so that certain actions are morally\nwrong even if the prevailing set of norms in a culture fails\nto condemn them as such \u2026. Acknowledging \u2026 that moral\nrules are a species of social norm, and that they have a lot in common\nwith rules of etiquette, appears to set in motion a dynamic that leads\nto moral relativism.\n\nIn recent years, the impulse to distinguish moral rules from other\ntypes of social norms has received what many philosophers take to be\nempirical support from the psychological research of Elliot Turiel and\nhis collaborators. Turiel is well-known for having argued that there\nare two distinct \u201cdomains\u201d of social cognition, the\n\u201cmoral\u201d and the \u201cconventional,\u201d and that even\nvery young children are able to distinguish the two. Many philosophers\nhave been quick to jump on this, as proof that moral rules are\nfundamentally different from \u201cconventional\u201d social norms.\nJesse Prinz, for instance, appeals to Turiel\u2019s authority in\nclaiming that \u201cBy the time children are 3, they recognize that\nsome rules are moral (e.g. don\u2019t hit other children) and others\nare merely conventional (don\u2019t talk without raising your\nhand)\u201d (Prinz 2006, 29\u201343; see also Joyce 2006[a],\n136\u2013137; Nichols 2004, 5\u20137). Gerald Gaus, again citing\nTuriel, writes that \u201ceven children see moral rules as\nnon-conventional\u201d (2010, 172). This is often a prelude to the\nclaim that moral judgments are generated by some special moral\nfaculty, or set of emotional reactions, or rational capacity, that\nputs them outside the space of social norms (and thus, many will\nargue, exempts them from cultural variability). (Heath 2017:\n277\u2013278)\n\n\nThe idea that moral judgments are generated by a \u201cspecial moral\nfaculty\u201d can be developed in a variety of ways, some of which\nhave led to a resurgence of interest in moral nativism. As noted\nearlier, Turiel and his fellow social domain theorists are\nconstructivists who reject nativist accounts of the morality. But a\nnumber of philosophers, including Susan Dwyer (Dwyer 1999, 2006, 2007;\nDwyer, Huebner, & Hauser 2010), Richard Joyce (2006a, 2006b), John\nMikhail (2014, 2022), and Shaun Nichols (2005) have used the findings\nof the social domain theorists in arguments aimed at establishing that\nsubstantial aspects of morality are innate. Some of these authors go\non to argue morality is the product of natural selection and that it\nis an adaptation. Other philosophers, notably Jesse Prinz (2007a: ch.\n7; 2007b) and Edouard Machery and Ron Mallon (2010) have elaborated\ndetailed responses.\n\nThe most extensive appeal to empirical work on the moral/conventional\ndistinction in the philosophical literature has been in the\nintertwined debates over moral internalism and the moral\nresponsibility of psychopaths. To explain these debates, a bit of\nbackground is needed. When someone judges that an action is the\nmorally right or morally required thing to do it is often the case\nthat she goes on to do it. Why? What is her motivation for\ndoing what she judges to be morally required? From the ancient Greeks\nonward, philosophers have been interested in moral motivation, and in\nrecent decades debates over the nature of moral motivation have played\na prominent role in metaethics. One central component in this\nmulti-faceted discussion is the debate between various versions of\ninternalism, which hold\n\n\nthat motivation is internal to moral judgment, in the sense that moral\njudgment itself motivates without need of an accompanying desire,\n\n\nand various versions of externalism which insist that\n\n\nmoral motivation occurs when a moral judgment combines with a desire,\nand the content of the judgment is related to the content of the\ndesire so as to rationalize the action.\n\n\nThe quotes are from Rosati\u2019s outstanding Stanford\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy overview of the moral motivation\nliterature (Rosati 2016: \u00a73; entry on\n moral motivation)\n in which she goes on to note that\n\n\ndebates between internalists and externalists often center on the\nfigure of the \u201camoralist\u201d\u2014the person who apparently\nmakes moral judgments, while remaining wholly unmoved to comply with\nthem.\n\n\nInternalists typically insist that the amoralist is a conceptual\nimpossibility, and that\n\n\nthe person who appears to be making a moral judgment while\nremaining unmoved, must really \u2026 be speaking\ninsincerely\u2026. [S]he judges an act \u201cright\u201d only in\nan \u201cinverted commas\u201d sense (R.M. Hare, 1963)\u2026.\n(Rosati 2016: \u00a73)\n\n\nHowever, some philosophers think that psychopaths provide a prima\nfacie challenge to this claim.\n\nPsychopaths, who are diagnosed using a standard psychopathy checklist\n(Robert Hare 1991) are individuals who appear to be cognitively\nnormal. They typically do not have impaired reasoning abilities, and\nthey are aware of and seem able to comprehend prevailing moral and\nsocial rules. However, psychopaths often engage in antisocial behavior\nand they manifest no guilt or remorse for their morally aberrant\nbehavior. Since psychopaths apparently can, and often do make moral\njudgments that they are not motivated to comply with, they seem to\npose a problem for internalists. Indeed, borrowing an apt locution\nfrom Roskies (2003), psychopaths would appear to be \u201cwalking\ncounterexamples\u201d to\n internalism.[26]\n\nIt\u2019s at this point that the moral/conventional distinction\nbecomes relevant. In an influential paper, psychologist R. James Blair\n(1995) reported using a version of the moral/conventional task with\nincarcerated psychopathic offenders of normal intelligence and with\nincarcerated non-psychopathic offenders, all of whom were charged with\nmurder or manslaughter. The responses of the non-psychopathic\noffenders were similar to those that social domain theorists have\nreported with normal adults, but the responses of the psychopathic\noffenders were notably different. They responded in the same way to\nmoral and conventional\n transgressions.[27]\n Similar results were reported in a study that compared children with\npsychopathic tendencies to non-psychopathic children who had other\nemotional and behavioral issues (Blair 1997). These results led a\nnumber of authors to conclude that psychopaths do not have\n\u201cnormal moral concepts\u201d (Prinz 2007a: 42\u201347), or\nthat their moral concepts are \u201cimpaired\u201d (Schroeder,\nRoskies, & Nichols 2010: 96; Nichols 2004: 19 & 113), and thus\nthat they \u201cdo not mean what the rest of us mean when using moral\nterms\u201d (Kennett & Fine 2007: 175). If that\u2019s right,\nthen, these authors maintained, psychopaths do not really make moral\njudgments, as ordinarily understood, and they pose no challenge to\ninternalism. However, Kumar (2016) argues that philosophers have often\noverinterpreted Blair\u2019s findings. Though the studies indicate\nthat psychopaths \u201cdo not have a full grasp of moral\nconcepts\u201d, Kumar maintains that the studies do not show that\npsychopaths \u201ccompletely fail to grasp them\u201d. So while\npsychopaths don\u2019t make \u201cfull-fledged moral\njudgments\u201d, they can and do make what Kumar calls \u201cproto\nmoral judgments\u201d. Because of this, Kumar maintains, the\nimplications of research on psychopaths for the debate between\ninternalists and externalists is \u201cless straightforward\u201d\nthen philosophers have assumed. In a similar vein, Roskies (2007: 204)\nargues that studies of psychopaths do not establish \u201cthat they\nlack moral concepts or an adequate understanding of them\u201d or\nthat they are \u201cincapable of anything but moral judgments in an\ninverted comma sense\u201d.\n\nIn addition to being invoked in debates between internalists and\nexternalists, Blair\u2019s studies have also played a role in\nphilosophical discussions of the conditions under which people are\nmorally responsible for their behavior. Neil Levy has argued that\npsychopaths \u201cought to be excused moral responsibility for their\nwrongdoing\u201d because their \u201cfailure to grasp the\nmoral/conventional distinction\u201d indicates that they do not\nunderstand \u201cwhat makes a moral norm moral\u201d (Levy 2007b:\n163\u2013164).\n\n\nPsychopaths know, at least typically, that their actions are widely\nperceived to be wrong, to be sure, but they are unable to grasp the\ndistinctive nature and significance of their wrongness. Psychopaths\napparently take harm to others to be wrong only because such\nharms are against the rules. For them, stealing from, or hurting,\nanother is no more wrong than, say, double-parking or line-jumping.\nBut the kind and degree of wrongness, and therefore blame, that\nattaches to infringement of the rules is very different, and usually\nmuch less significant, than the kind and degree attaching to moral\nwrongs. For psychopaths, all offences are merely conventional, and\ntherefore\u2014from their point of view\u2014none of them are all\nthat serious. Hence, their degree of responsibility is smaller,\narguably much smaller, than it would be for a comparable harm\ncommitted by a normal agent. Indeed, there are grounds for excusing\nthem from moral responsibility altogether. (Levy 2007a: 132)\n\n\nFine and Kennett defend a very similar conclusion:\n\n\n[W]hile psychopathic offenders certainly appear to know what acts are\nprohibited by society or the law (and therefore know that their\ntransgressions are legally wrong), they do not appear to have the\ncapacity to judge an act to be morally wrong\u2026. We would argue\nthat psychopathic offenders, who fail to understand the distinction\nbetween moral wrongs and conventional wrongs, cannot be considered to\nbe moral agents. (2004: 432)\n\n\nSince Levy, Fine, and Kennett all take moral responsibility to be\nnecessary for criminal responsibility, they maintain that psychopaths\nare not criminally responsible.\n\nOther authors draw quite different conclusions from Blair\u2019s\nstudies. Both Maibom (2008) and Vargas and Nichols (2007) note that\ndespite their apparent inability to distinguish moral from\nconventional transgressions, psychopaths are sensitive to the fact\nthat there are norms prohibiting a wide range of behaviors, and that\nviolating these norms can lead to sanctions. For Maibom, this\nawareness is enough to undergird both moral and criminal\nresponsibility. Endorsing a similar view, Vargas and Nichols note that\n\u201cwe do think it is appropriate to blame and punish transgressors\nof conventional rules\u201d. Why, they ask, \u201cis this not enough\nto blame and punish psychopaths?\u201d (2007: 159).\n\nDavid Shoemaker (2011) is skeptical about drawing any conclusions\nabout the moral or criminal responsibility of psychopaths based on\nBlair\u2019s studies. In support of his skepticism, he draws\nattention to critiques of work in the Turiel tradition by Nissan\n(1987); Haidt, Koller, and Dias (1993); Kelly et al. (2007); and\nothers. More pointedly, he stresses that judgments about the\nseriousness of a transgression play a central role in Blair\u2019s\nversion of the moral/conventional task, and he challenges the\nassumption that moral transgressions are judged to be more serious\nthan putatively conventional transgressions. Shoemaker references a\nstudy by Elizabeth Fitton and Ann Dowker who controlled for perceived\nseriousness and found that\n\n\nwhen the so-called conventional transgressions matched the so-called\nmoral transgressions in perceived seriousness \u2026 [normal]\nchildren failed to differentiate the domains \u201cin terms of rule\ncontingency, perceived obligations and the justifications used.\u201d\nIndeed, these children tended to judge that the conventional behaviors\nwere more obligatory than the moral ones. (Shoemaker 2011:\n107, italics in original, quoting a 2002 paper presented at the MOSAIC\nconference in Liverpool \u201cQualitative and Quantitative Dimensions\nof Domain Differentiation\u201d)\n\n\nShoemaker\u2019s skepticism about the philosophical importance of\nBlair\u2019s findings is reinforced by the work of Aharoni and\ncolleagues (2012) who undertook a conceptual replication of\nBlair\u2019s prisoner study using a modified version of the\nmoral/conventional task that focused on authority independence and\nused a forced-choice format to minimize strategic responding. Their\nstudy included 109 incarcerated criminal offenders. (In Blair\u2019s\noriginal study there were only ten psychopathic participants and 10\nnon-psychopaths.) To assess the level of psychopathy for each inmate\nparticipant, they used Hare\u2019s Revised Psychopathy Checklist\nalong with two other measures. The crucial finding was that\n\n\ntotal psychopathy score did not predict performance on the\n[moral/conventional] task.\n\n\nAharoni and colleagues conclude that\n\n\ncontrary to earlier claims, insufficient data exist to infer that\npsychopathic individuals cannot know what is morally wrong. (2012:\n484)\n\n\nThe moral/conventional task is not the only tool that psychologists\nhave used to explore deficits in moral reasoning. In a survey of the\nliterature, Schaich Borg and Sinnott-Armstrong (2013) review the\nfindings of studies with psychopaths using the moral/conventional task\nand five quite different tools. Their conclusion is hardly encouraging\nfor philosophers who hope that studies of moral cognition in\npsychopaths will yield important philosophical payoffs.\n\n\nThe studies reviewed in this chapter support a tentative and qualified\nconclusion: If psychopaths have any deficits or abnormalities in their\nmoral judgments, their deficits seem subtle\u2014much more subtle\nthan might be expected from their blatantly abnormal behavior. Indeed,\nthe current literature \u2026 suggests that psychopaths might not\nhave any specific deficits in moral cognition, despite their\ndifferences in moral action, emotion, and empathy. (2013: 123)\n\n\nThe take-home message of this section is that authors who invoke\nstudies using the moral/conventional task in arguing for philosophical\nconclusions should be very cautious. There are many different versions\nof the task, and it is far from clear that any of them give us\nreliable information about the nature of moral cognition or about the\nmoral cognition of children, psychopaths or other groups of\nphilosophical interest.\n",
