Pure logic, meaning, intuitive fulfillment and intentionality\n\nAs a philosopher with a mathematical background, Husserl was\ninterested in developing a general theory of inferential systems,\nwhich (following Bolzano) he conceived of as a theory of science, on\nthe ground that every science (including mathematics) can be looked\nupon as a system of propositions that are interconnected by a set of\ninferential and grounding relations. Following John S. Mill, he argues\nin Logical Investigations that the best way to study the\nnature of such propositional systems is to start with their linguistic\nmanifestations, i.e., (sets of) sentences and (assertive) utterances\nthereof.\n\nHow are we to analyse these sentences and the propositions they\nexpress? Husserl\u2019s approach is to study the units of\nconsciousness that the respective speaker presents himself as\nhaving\u2014that he \u201cgives voice to\u201d\u2014in expressing\nthe proposition in question (for instance, while writing a\nmathematical textbook or giving a lecture). These units of\nconsciousness he labels intentional acts or intentional\nexperiences, since they always represent something as\nsomething\u2014thus exhibiting what Brentano called intentionality.\nAccording to Husserl, there are non-intentional units of consciousness\nas well. (He quotes pain as an example.) What distinguishes\nintentional from non-intentional experiences is the former\u2019s\nhaving intentional content.\n\nEven objectless (i.e., empty) intentional experiences like your\nthought of the winged horse Pegasus have content. On Husserl\u2019s\nview, that thought simply lacks a corresponding object; the\nintentional act is \u201cmerely as of\u201d, but not really of, an\nobject. Husserl rejects \u201crepresentationalist\u201d accounts of\nintentionality, such as the mental image theory, according to which\nintentional experiences represent intra-mental pictorial\nrepresentations of objects, where like other pictures such images may\nexist without there being a depicted object in the actual world. For\nHusserl, this view leads to a \u201cfalse duplication\u201d of\nobjects represented in the veridical case; and it already presupposes\nwhat an adequate conception of pictorial representation is yet to\naccomplish: an explanation of what it is that makes the underlying\n\u201cphantasy content\u201d, or phantasm, \u201cthe [r]epresenting\nimage of something or other\u201d (Husserl 1994, p. 347;\nHusserliana, vol. XXII, pp. 305f). It is precisely an\nintentional content that does the trick here (as in all cases of\nintentional consciousness), according to Husserl, in a way to be\nexplained in more detail by his phenomenology of consciousness.\n\nIn the case of propositional acts, i.e., units of consciousness that\ncan be given voice to by a complete sentence (paradigmatically, a\ndeclarative sentence), Husserl identifies their content with the\npropositional meaning expressed by that sentence. In the case of their\nnon-propositional but still intentional parts, he identifies the\ncorresponding intentional content with a sub-propositional meaning.\nFor example, the judgement \u201cNapoleon is a Frenchman\u201d\ncontains an act of thinking of Napoleon whose intentional content is\nthe sub-propositional meaning expressed by the name\n\u201cNapoleon\u201d. (Accordingly, the judgement can be looked upon\nas an act of ascribing the property of being French to the referent of\nthat name.) Experiences like this, which can be given voice to by\neither a singular or a general term, are called \u201cnominal\nacts\u201d (as opposed to the propositional acts containing them).\nTheir contents are called \u201cnominal meanings\u201d.\n\nHusserl regards both propositional and nominal meanings as the\nsubject-matter of \u201cpure logic\u201d or \u201clogic in the wide\nsense\u201d\u2014the study of (i) what distinguishes sense (alias\nmeaning) from nonsense (this part of pure logic being called\n\u201cpure grammar\u201d) and (ii) which of the senses delivered by\npure grammar are logically consistent and which of them are not (this\npart of pure logic being labelled \u201clogic in the narrow\nsense\u201d).\n\nAn important and still largely unexplored claim of Husserl\u2019s is\nthat any logically consistent meaning can in principle be subjectively\nfulfilled, more or less adequately, by a unified intuition, such as an\nact of continuous perception or intuitive imagination, where the\nstructure and other essential features of the meaning in question can\nbe read off from the respective mode of intuitive fulfillment.\nInconsistent meanings can be singled out and studied by means of\n(reflection upon) corresponding experiences of intuitive conflict,\nlike for instance the discrete switching back and forth between a\nduck-head-imagination and a rabbit-head-imagination in the case of an\nattempted intuitive imagination of a duck-head that is at the same\ntime a rabbit-head. Some meanings are inconsistent for formal-logical\nreasons. According to Husserl, all analytically false propositions\nbelong to this category. Other meanings are inconsistent because they\nconflict with some general material a priori truth, also called\n\u201cessential law\u201d. The proposition expressed by the sentence\n\u201cThere are perceptual objects whose surface is both (visibly)\ncompletely green and completely red at the same time\u201d is a case\nin point.\n\nMeanings generally and propositions in particular exist independently\nof their actually functioning as intentional content. Thus, true\npropositions such as the Pythagorean theorem can be\ndiscovered. Propositions and their components are abstract,\ni.e., atemporal, objects. However, what does it mean to grasp\na proposition or, more generally, a sense? How can an abstract object\nbecome the content of an intentional act? Combining ideas of Bolzano\nand Lotze, Husserl answers this question by taking recourse to the\nnotion of an ideal (i.e., abstract) species or type,\nas follows. Propositions and other meanings are ideal species that can\nbe (but do not have to be) instantiated by certain particular\nfeatures, i.e., dependent parts, of intentional acts. Those species\nare also called \u201cideal matters\u201d. The particular features\ninstantiating an ideal matter\u2014Husserl refers to them as\n\u201cmoments of matter\u201d\u2014are laid bare by\nphenomenological description, a reflection-based (or introspective)\nanalysis taking into account both the linguistic expression(s) (if\nany) and the modes of (possible) intuitive fulfillment or conflict\nassociated with the respective experience.\n\nSince phenomenological description yields ideal species, it involves\nwhat Husserl was later (notably in Ideas) to call\n\u201ceidetic reduction\u201d, i.e., an unfolding of abstract\nfeatures shared by appropriate sets of fictitious or real-life\nexamples, by way, e.g., of free imaginative variation on an\narbitrarily chosen initial example (for the method of \u201cfree\nvariation\u201d, see Experience and Judgement, sec. 87).\n\nPhenomenological description also yields the \u201cmoment of\nquality\u201d of the intentional experience under investigation,\ni.e., the particular feature instantiating its psychological mode\n(judgement, conscious deliberation, conscious desire, conscious hope,\netc.), which roughly corresponds to the speech act mode of an\nutterance giving voice to that experience. Furthermore, the\ndescription yields relations of \u201cfoundation\u201d, i.e.,\none-sided or mutual relative existential dependencies between (1) the\nexperience in question and other experiences and (2) the particular\ndescriptive features of the experience. Thus, an experience of\npleasure about a given event is one-sidedly founded, relative to the\nstream of consciousness it belongs to, in a particular belief-state to\nthe effect that this event has occurred. (The relativization to a\nparticular stream of consciousness makes sure that both founded and\nfounding experience occur in the same person\u2019s mind.) Like all\nfoundation relations, this one holds in virtue of an essential law, to\nthe effect that conscious pleasure about some state of affairs\nrequires a corresponding (and simultaneous) belief. Quite generally, a\ngiven object a of type F is founded in a particular\nobject b of type G (where a is different\nfrom b and F is different from G) relative\nto a particular whole c of type H if and only if (i)\nthere is an essential law in virtue of which it holds that for any\nobject x of type F there is an object y of\ntype G and a whole z of type H, such that\nboth x and y are (proper) parts of z, and\n(ii) both a and b are (proper) parts of c.\nOf course, the notion of an essential law needs further clarification\n(see De Santis 2021, pt. III ff).\n",
