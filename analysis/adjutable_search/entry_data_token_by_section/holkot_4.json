    "main_text": "Natural Theology || What reason can do\n3.2 What reason can do\n\nIf basic theological premises require revelation for human beings to\nknow them, then the arena of human reason in theology is restricted to\nreasoning about what is revealed. Some of the tenets of Christian\ndoctrine, like the doctrines of the Trinity, Incarnation and\nEucharist, offer particular challenges to logic. There was a general\nbelief among medieval scholastics that Aristotelian logic exemplified\nnatural reason at its best and was universally applicable to all\ndomains because its rules held through formal relation to the\nprinciple of non-contradiction. If key Christian doctrines were not\namenable to Aristotelian logical principles, however, it would seem to\nimply that God is not subject to the principle of non-contradiction\nand that Aristotelian logic is not universal. Holkot took up these\nissues in his discussion of the doctrine of the Trinity.\n\nDifficulty arises in the doctrine of the Trinity over doctrinally true\npremises that seem to give rise to doctrinally false conclusions:\n\nThe divine Essence is the Father,\n\n\nThe divine Essence is the Son,\n\nTherefore, the Father is the Son.\n\n\nPrior to Holkot, a variety of distinctions had been proposed to modify\nthe identity relation of the copula in such premises and to block the\nconclusion. But Holkot objected that the divine Essence was in no way\n\u201creally,\u201d \u201cmodally,\u201d \u201cformally,\u201d\n\u201crationally,\u201d \u201cconvertibly,\u201d nor in any other\nway distinguished from the divine Persons or the divine relations of\npaternity, filiation and spiration. This put him back face to face\nwith the dilemma.\n\nHolkot responded in a passage for which he is perhaps best known, that\nthere must be two systems of logic, a logic appropriate to the natural\norder, exemplified in Aristotle\u2019s works, and a logic appropriate\nto the supernatural order, a logic of faith, whose rules are\nsupplementary to those of Aristotle (Slotemaker and Witt 2015,\n74\u201381, esp. 78). He concluded that Aristotelian logic did not\nhold universally, but only for the natural order unless additions were\nmade to take into account theological cases. This did not mean that he\nabandoned the principle of non-contradiction in matters of faith.\nRather the nature of the divine being meant that syllogisms involving\nTrinitarian terms functioned like expository syllogisms about\nparticulars when unquantified universal terms are substituted for\nparticular ones:\n\nHuman being is running,\n\n\nHuman being is bald.\n\nTherefore, bald human being is running.\n\n\nThe conclusion is invalid because the subject term in each premise\nmight stand for different people, like Plato and Socrates.\n\nHolkot argued that since Aristotle could not have known about God as\nthree Persons and one divine Essence, he could not have foreseen the\nneed to adjust his logic for such cases, but with some supplementary\nrules taken from religious authority, like: \u201cevery absolute is\npredicated in the singular and not in the plural about the three\npersons,\u201d and \u201cunity holds its consequent where the\nopposition of relation does not stand in the way\u201d\n(Sent. I, q. 5, f. f2ra), Holkot believed the Trinitarian\ncases could be covered. The logic of faith does not have a large\nnumber of additional principles, and it, like Aristotelian logic, is\nrational because it is subject to the principle of\nnon-contradiction.\n\nHolcot\u2019s view of the relation between faith and reason was very\nmuch in the tradition of Anselm, of faith seeking understanding. His\nadherence to the principle of non-contradiction was uncompromising:\n\u201cno intellect can assent to the opposite of the first principle\nor believe that contradictories are true at the same time\u201d\n(Quod. I, q. 2, in Exploring, 38, ll.\n165\u2013166). Faith required that reason believe that all of the\ntruths of the faith are compatible, even when at times they could not\nbe demonstrated or shown to be so.\n",
