    "main_text": "Explanatory Sentimentalism || Moral Sense Theories\n2.1 Moral Sense Theories\n\nWhile the importance of emotion in ethical thought has been recognized\nby philosophers at least since Aristotle and Mencius, the roots of the\nmodern sentimentalist tradition in ethics go back to early\n18th century debates in Britain. Anthony Ashley Cooper,\nbetter known by his title as the Earl of Shaftesbury, introduced the\nnotion of a moral sense in his Inquiry Concerning\nVirtue, or Merit. According to Shaftesbury, the primary\nobject of moral evaluation is the \u201caffection\u201d or motive\nbehind the action. Such affections can, by reflection, become the\nobject of a second-order affection:\n\n\nIn a Creature capable of forming general Notions of Things, not only\nthe outward Beings which offer themselves to the Sense, are the\nObjects of the Affection; but the very Actions themselves, and the\nAffections of Pity, Kindness, Gratitude, and their Contrarys, being\nbrought into the Mind by Reflection, become Objects. So that, by means\nof this reflected Sense, there arises another kind of Affection\ntowards those very Affections themselves, which have been already\nfelt, and are now become the Subject of a new Liking or Dislike.\n(Shaftesbury 1699\u20131714: 16)\n\n\nMoral approval is explained by (and perhaps consists in) this sort of\nsecond-order liking, which Shaftesbury usually designates the\n\u2018Sense of Right or Wrong\u2019. This sense is innate or\nnatural, and can be displaced only by \u201ccontrary habit and\ncustom\u201d (1699\u20131714: 25), although it may on occasion be\novercome by \u201crage, lust, or any other counterworking\npassion\u201d (1699\u20131714: 35). On Shaftesbury\u2019s view,\nwhat it approves of are natural or public affections, which are the\nbeautiful and harmonious motives tending towards the good of the whole\nsystem of rational creatures. To be virtuous, a creature must not only\ndo the right things, but exercise its moral sense and act for the very\nreason that something is worthy and honest (1699\u20131714: 18).\nThat\u2019s why even the kindest dog can\u2019t be virtuous, as long\nas it lacks the ability to reflect on its affections and act on the\nresulting affect.\n\nFrances Hutcheson fills in Shaftesbury\u2019s sketch to some extent.\nHis argument for the existence of a moral sense draws on his rejection\nof rationalism and intuitionism (see\n Supplement on Anti-Rationalist Arguments).\n Since we don\u2019t approve of actions because of self-interest or\nself-evidence, something else must explain our convictions. According\nto him, a sense is a \u201cdetermination of the mind, to\nreceive any idea from the presence of an object which occurs to us,\nindependent of our will\u201d (1725: 90). There are many more such\nsenses than traditionally acknowledged. Since moral ideas arise\nspontaneously, Hutcheson concludes we have a moral sense,\n\n\na determination of our minds to receive amiable or disagreeable ideas\nof Actions, when they occur to observation, antecedent to any opinions\nof advantage or loss to redound to ourselves from them. (1725:\n100)\n\n\nThe moral sense, though not moral ideas, is innate, as can be seen\nfrom the sentiments of small children when they begin to respond to\nactions (1725: 145\u2013146).\n\nOn Hutcheson\u2019s early (and best known) view, what the moral sense\napproves of is above all \u201cthe general calm desire of the\nhappiness of others\u201d, in distinction from particular benevolent\npassions like love and compassion (1728: 175). On this picture, in\ncontrast to Shaftesbury, the motive of morally praiseworthy actions is\nbenevolence and not the thought that the action is obligatory\nor that it would be approved of by the moral sense itself. In\nHutcheson\u2019s terminology, moral sense is the source of justifying\nreasons, but not exciting reasons. (For the development of\nHutcheson\u2019s views, see Bishop 1996).\n\nSome key features of these early sentimentalist theories are shared by\nthe psychologist Jonathan Haidt\u2019s (2012) contemporary model.\nHaidt\u2019s starting point is an increasingly common distinction in\npsychology between two kinds of cognitive process. Type I or intuitive\nprocesses are automatic, effortless, fast, often associative,\nparallel, affective, and often modular (that is, making use of only\ndomain-specific information). We are only conscious of their outputs,\nnot the processes themselves. (They are thus parallel to\nHutcheson\u2019s \u2018senses\u2019.) Type II\n\u2018reflective\u2019 or \u2018reasoning\u2019 processes are, in\ncontrast, conscious, effortful, slow, memory-taxing, sometimes\ninferential, rational, and linear processes. As is common in\npsychology, Haidt uses the term \u2018intuition\u2019 for beliefs\nthat result from the intuitive processes.\n\nHaidt\u2019s empirical claim is that moral judgments are for the most\npart intuitions proximally caused by gut reactions, quick and\nautomatic flashes of affect. In support of this, manipulating affect\nhas been shown to make a difference to people\u2019s judgments\n(Wheatley and Haidt 2005), and areas of the brain associated with such\naffective responses found active when people make judgments (e.g.,\nGreene and Haidt 2002; Moll, de Oliveira-Souza, and Eslinger 2003).\nFurther, in some studies, people are easily dumbfounded when\nchallenged on their moral views: they cannot (Haidt claims) give\nreasons for why they disapprove of harmless sibling incest, for\nexample (Haidt 2001). On Haidt\u2019s somewhat pessimistic picture,\nthe role of reason is for the most part lawyerly rationalization of\nthe pre-existing gut reactions, in particular in a social context. In\nthe same vein, Joshua Greene (2008) claims on the basis of brain\nimaging and reaction-time data (Greene et al. 2001), among others,\nthat it is in particular deontological judgments, such as the\nthought that it is wrong to kill one person as a means to save five,\nthat are driven by affective gut reactions, which philosophers like\nKant subsequently try to rationalize. Greene holds that\nutilitarian judgments, in contrast, result from conscious\nreasoning. However, Guy Kahane (2012) argues persuasively that once we\nlook at broader data, we see that the difference between Type I and\nType II processes corresponds to the difference between intuitive and\ncounterintuitive judgments rather than deontological and utilitarian\ncontent.\n\nWhere the early sentimentalists gesture towards divine providence when\nit comes to explaining why we have a moral sense and why it approves\nof things like benevolence, Haidt\u2019s story appeals to evolution.\nHe believes we are pre-programmed to respond to suffering with\ncompassion, the arrogance of subordinates with contempt, cheating with\nanger, and impurity with disgust, for example. These culturally\nfine-tuned affective responses are in turn distally explained by\nhaving been evolutionary \u201cadaptations to long-standing threats\nand opportunities in social life\u201d of our ancestors (Haidt\n2012).\n\nOne challenge for Haidt\u2019s view is that unlike classical\nsentimentalist views, it doesn\u2019t distinguish between moral and\nnon-moral evaluations. When talking about intuitions in his sense, he\nsays that\n\n\nthe brain has a kind of gauge (sometimes called a\n\u201clike-ometer\u201d) that is constantly moving back and forth,\nand these movements, these quick judgments, influence whatever comes\nnext. (Haidt and Bj\u00f6rklund 2008: 186\u2013187)\n\n\nBut we don\u2019t regard everything we dislike, or even everything\nthat makes us angry, as morally wrong. The story is at least\nincomplete. Further, as a psychologist, Haidt naturally offers no\na priori arguments against the possibility of reason yielding\nmoral verdicts. All he can claim is that people don\u2019t\nusually engage in reasoning first. Even if that is true, it\ndoesn\u2019t follow that people\u2019s judgments are not shaped by\nreasoning or that they are insensitive to reasons. Indeed, Daniel\nJacobson (2012) points out that the evidence that people lack reasons\nfor their judgments is in fact very thin. In Haidt\u2019s most famous\nexample, even harmless sibling incest involves a significant\nrisk of suffering emotional repercussions (Railton 2014:\n849). The vibe at your sister\u2019s wedding three years later might\nnot be quite the same. People might not be able to immediately\narticulate such reasons, but that doesn\u2019t show that they were\nnot responding to them. Rather than being mere rationalization,\npost hoc reasoning might then be a process of trying to\narticulate the considerations one\u2019s intuitive judgments were\nresponsive to.\n\nRecently, Joshua May (2018) has challenged the primacy of affect in\nmoral thought on empirical grounds. He argues that the best evidence\nwe have supports only a more modest role for emotions as facilitating\n(or hindering) information processing. May notes that manipulating\nincidental emotions \u2013 that is, emotions that are not directed\ntowards or aroused by the object of moral judgment, such as disgust\ncaused by foul odors (Schnall et al. 2008) \u2013 has only been found\nto have minor effects. He rightly points out that such scarce and\nminor effects don\u2019t support any claims about a leading or\nessential role for affect in moral judgment. Following Heidi Maibom\n(2005), he also argues that problems in the moral judgment of\npsychopaths are better explained by rational rather than emotional\ndeficits.\n\nMay holds that instead of mere feeling, moral judgments are typically\nexplained by reasoning, albeit often reasoning of an automatic and\nunconscious Type I variety. He supports this claim by appeal to many\nstudies that suggest that moral judgments are sensitive to features\nlike intentionality (see Young and Tsoi 2013 for an overview) and the\nuse of personal force (see Greene et al. 2009), and more generally the\nextent of attributed agential involvement. As May summarizes the view,\n\u201cWe often rapidly infer the moral status of an action in part by\nrelying on general principles that identify as morally relevant\nvarious features of agents, actions, and outcomes\u2026. This is a\nmatter of reasoning or inference, whether implicit, explicit, or some\ncombination of the two across time\u201d (2018: 70).\n\nWhile May\u2019s data and arguments are a healthy corrective for some\nexaggerated forms of explanatory sentimentalism, such as\nHaidt\u2019s, it is unclear how much sentimentalists should worry\nabout them. After all, the key evidence for explanatory sentimentalism\nis not meant to come from incidental emotions, but from the\nfact that we, say, disapprove of the sort of things that independently\narouse negative emotion. The sentimentalist can relatively easily\nexplain the targets of our condemnation by appealing to independent\nemotional reactions, while for the rationalist, it is merely a\ncoincidence that apes get mad about the very same sort of things that\nour reason tells us to disapprove of. And it is compatible with\nexplanatory sentimentalism that people first reason\n(consciously or not) about non-moral facts and then respond with\nemotion, which is still needed to cross the gap between non-moral and\nmoral judgment. As Hume has it, although sentiment renders the final\nverdict, \u201cin order to pave the way for such a sentiment, and\ngive a proper discernment of its object, it is often necessary, we\nfind, that much reasoning should precede, that nice distinctions be\nmade, just conclusions drawn\u201d (1751: 15).\n",
