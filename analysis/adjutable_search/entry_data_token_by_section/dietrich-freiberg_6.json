    "main_text": "The Hierarchy of Being\n7. The Hierarchy of Being\n\n\nDietrich of Freiberg thus presents us with a bifurcated universe of\nbeings, but one that is nonetheless a hierarchy of beings. For he\ndescribes in the very opening words of his De visione\nbeatifica the traditional hierarchy of the Christian Middle Ages,\neven invoking the great authority of Dionysius the Areopagite:\n\n\nWe have it from Saint Dionysius that the universe of beings is\ndivided into the highest, the middle, and the lowest with respect to\nthe disposition of its order; its tripart division being capable of\neven greater distinction in relation to the most general modes and\ngrades of beings. Thus in each of these three divisions there is\nclearly found a higher, a middle, and a lower. This does not go on to\ninfinity, but must reach its limit at two extremes, at something\nhighest on the one hand and something lowest on the other. On these\ndepend the grade and order of all the things located between the two\naccording to the proximity to or distance from these extremes.\n\n\n\n\nR.D. T\u00e9treau calls attention to the fact that the invocation of\nthe Ps-Dionysius is vague and somewhat deceptive. He notes that no\nspecific text of Dionysius is cited. Furthermore the great Church\nFather is not mentioned again throughout the rest of the treatise and\nis not cited at all in the De intellectu and the De\nanimatione caeli. E. Krebs in his study, Meister Dietrich:\nSein Leben, seine Werke, seine Wissenschaft, notices that in the\nDe animatione caeli Dietrich cites Boethius in establishing\nthe procession of beings that marks his hierarchy. Dietrich, he\nargues, identifies himself with a particular school of Neoplatonists\nwhich sees the One as the ultimate and final principle of not only\nhierarchy but of created being itself. This school includes Proclus\nand the author or authors of the Liber de causis.\n\n\nDietrich develops a particular version of the hierarchy of being based\non this Neoplatonic One. By identifying the One of Proclus\u2019\nElements of Theology with the creative God of Christian\ntheology he introduces a dynamic element into the hierarchy of being\nwhereby God brings beings into existence out of nothing and marks them\nwith a resemblance or similitude to himself. The universe is thus like\nGod and each productive being in its hierarchically ordered series of\ncauses is also like God. Dietrich specifically cites propositions 146\nand 147 of Proclus which emphasize the r\u00f4le of similitude in\nthis hierarchy:\n\n\nProp. 146: In the procession of all divine things the ends are\nassimilated to their beginnings, sustaining a circle without beginning\nand without end by turning to the beginning.\n\n\n\nProp. 147: The highest of all the divine orders are assimilated to the\nlast of those positioned above them\n\n\nComment to Prop. 147: For if there must be continuity of the divine\nprocession and each order must be connected by the proper middle terms,\nit is necessary that the highest terms of the secondary ranks be joined\nto the last terms of the first ranks. Conjunction, however, occurs\nthrough likeness. Thus likeness occurs between the first of the lower\nranks and the last of the higher ranks.\n\n\n\nProposition 146 makes it clear that at each stage of the hierarchy of\nbeing the effect is like the cause just as each creature is like\nGod. Furthermore, just as there is a built-in bias, as if were, of an\neffect in relation to its cause in terms of a \u201cturning\u201d to\nits principle, so all creatures have a bias to return to the source or\nprinciple of their being. Proposition 147, along with its comment,\nassures Dietrich that his hierarchy is continuous and that this\ncontinuity is due solely to the likenesses that exist between the\nranks of being. But in addition to assimilating the Proclean doctrine\nof similitude in order to secure continuity of being, Dietrich\nintroduces his own astonishing principle of linkage in the De\nintellectu.  There he identifies the operation of a creature with\nits end. \u201cThis operation,\u201d he tells us, \u201cis the end\nof the thing, for the sake of which the thing exists.\u201d Then he\ngoes on to reveal how he conceives this operation to link one being\nwith another: \u201cBy means of this operation a thing tends beyond\nitself. It is due to this operation that there is found in each thing\nnot only being and truth, but also goodness. Thus each thing is\ninterchangeably being, true, and good.  Consequently, it is a being\nwith respect to itself, true as ordered to the intellect, and good\ninsofar as it actively overflows into something beyond itself.\u201d\nThis is a remarkable view of operation and end. The operation of a\ncreature always lies in moving beyond itself and this is its end or\npurpose. Nothing is static in Dietrich\u2019s universe, everything is\nmoving, attempting to return to its initial principle.  Creatures do\nnot have their end in themselves; everything is for the sake of\nsomething else and that something else is ultimately God.  Insofar as\na creature follows its proper operation it will be led out of itself\nand back to God.\n\n\nThere is something worth pausing and reflecting about here; the\nnatural means of salvation, if you will, are built right into the very\nstructure of things. The opus restaurationis is located\nwithin the opus conditionis. While it initially sounds odd to\nsay that a thing\u2019s operation is its end, the oddness disappears as\nsoon as one realizes that all operations are ultimately reditive. And\nas such they must lead a being beyond itself. One could put it another\nway by saying that for Dietrich the proper operation of every creature\nis to return to God. Dietrich\u2019s use of the Augustinian triad of being,\ntruth and goodness confirms this. A thing\u2019s being gives it\nself-reference and dignity with respect to the hierarchy of being. Its\ntruth gives it reference to intellect, thus opening it up to what\nDietrich calls ens conceptionale, being as conceived by the\nintellect, which in its own way reflects the universe of beings. But\nin its goodness, a thing is like God, overflowing into another,\nimparting itself to those below it in an act which might be called a\ncooperation with the redemption of all things.\n\n\nSimilitude thus gives a dynamic structure to the entire hierarchy of\nbeing and at the same time acts as the essential link between the\nintellect and the rest of the hierarchy. It is thus at one and the\nsame time a principle of being and a principle of knowing. But the\nsimilitude to the whole of being is not something that the intellect\nacquires by some effort on its own part; rather, such similitude is\npart of the very nature of intellect. \u201cOne should\nconsider,\u201d Dietrich remarks in the De intellectu,\n\u201cthat every intellect is a likeness of the whole of being, or of\nbeing as being, and it is such by reason of its essence.\u201d\n",
