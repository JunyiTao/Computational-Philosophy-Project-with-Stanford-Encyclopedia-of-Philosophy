    "main_text": "\n\n\nA singular term, such as a proper name or a demonstrative pronoun, is\na term that signifies exactly one individual thing. The existence of\nsingular terms raises various questions about how they function within\na language. Do proper names have a sense as well as a referent? If\nthey do have a sense, what is it, and how do they acquire it? How is\nthis sense transmitted from one speaker to another? Is a demonstrative\npronoun purely referential? If one believes in a language of thought,\nor mental language, as did many medieval thinkers, what is the mental\ncorrelate of a singular term? While medieval thinkers did not produce\nany treatises devoted to singular terms, their writings do contain\nanswers to these questions, or at least, answers to similar questions\nthat they themselves posed in the context of their own semantic\ntheories. To discover medieval views of singular terms, one must\nconsult a variety of sources from grammar, logic, metaphysics, and\neven theology. Priscian, the semantically-oriented grammarian who\nwrote at the beginning of the sixth century C.E., was particularly\ninfluential, and his views were repeated by many later grammarians, as\nwell as by logicians and theologians. Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge, or\nintroduction to Aristotle\u2019s Categories, was another important\nsource, especially as his discussion allowed commentators to relate\nlinguistic problems to metaphysical problems concerning the nature of\nthe individual named by a singular term. Commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories discussed singular terms as examples of equivocal\nterms, those having more than one sense. Later in the Middle Ages and\nat the beginning of the sixteenth century, singular terms were\ndiscussed in treatises devoted to types of terms. Paul of Venice\u2019s\ntreatise is worthy of special mention here, despite the difficulty of\nconstruing many of his claims.  Because the use of singular terms was\ntied to singular concepts, they were also discussed in commentaries on\nAristotle\u2019s Physics, De anima, and\nMetaphysics. The commentaries of John Buridan (d. after 1358)\nprovide the richest and most coherent medieval theory, and one which\nremained influential into the sixteenth century. During the sixteenth\ncentury, singular concepts remained a subject of discussion in\ncommentaries on Aristotle\u2019s Physics and De anima, but\nunfortunately the logicians who came after Domingo de Soto (1494\u20131560)\nreverted to a very cursory treatment of singular terms. We have to\nwait for the nineteenth and twentieth centuries for a rediscovery of\nsome of the problems that had exercised John Buridan in the fourteenth\ncentury. \n",
