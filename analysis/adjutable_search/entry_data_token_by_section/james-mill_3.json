The Essay on Government, Mill later wrote, was meant to serve as a \u201ccomprehensive outline\u201d or \u201cskeleton map\u201d with whose aid one could find one\u2019s way across the vast, varied, and ofttimes confusing and dangerous terrain of politics (Mill 1820). Government, Mill maintains, is merely a means to an end, viz. the happiness of the whole community and the individuals composing it. We should begin by assuming that every human being is motivated by a desire to experience pleasure and to avoid pain. Pleasures and pains come from two sources, our fellow human beings and nature. Government is concerned directly with the first and indirectly with the second: \u201cIts business is to increase to the utmost the pleasures, and diminish to the utmost the pains, which men derive from one another.\u201d Yet, \u201cthe primary cause of government\u201d is to be found in nature itself, since humans must wrest from nature \u201cthe scanty materials of happiness\u201d (Mill 1992, 4\u20135). Nature and human nature combine to make government necessary. It is man\u2019s nature not only to desire happiness but to satisfy that desire by investing as little effort as possible. Labor being the means of obtaining happiness, and our own labor being painful to us, we will, if permitted, live off the labor of others. To the degree that others enjoy the fruits of my labor, my primary incentive for working\u2014namely my own happiness\u2014is diminished if not destroyed.\nTherefore, Mill continues, the primary problem in designing workable political institutions is to maximize the happiness of the community by minimizing the extent to which some of its members may encroach upon, and enjoy, the fruits of other people\u2019s labor. This cannot happen, Mill maintains, in a monarchy (wherein a single ruler exploits his subjects) or in an aristocracy (wherein a ruling elite exploits the common people). Nor can communal happiness be maximized in a direct democracy, since the time and effort required for ruling would be subtracted from that available for engaging in productive labor (Mill 1992, 7\u20139). The only system that serves as a means to the end of individual and communal happiness is representative democracy, wherein citizens elect representatives to deliberate and legislate on their behalf and in their interest. The problem immediately arises, however, as to how representatives can be made to rule on the people\u2019s behalf rather than their own. Mill\u2019s answer is that frequent elections and short terms in office make it unlikely that elected representatives will legislate only for their own benefit. After all, representatives are drawn from the ranks of the people to which they can, after their term in office ends, expect to return. Given what we might nowadays call the incentive structure of representative government, representatives have every reason to promote the people\u2019s interests instead of their own. Indeed, in a properly structured system, there will be an \u201cidentity of interests\u201d between representatives and the electorate (Mill 1992, 22).\n",
