    "main_text": "\n\nPragmatism is a philosophical tradition that \u2013 very broadly\n\u2013 understands knowing the world as inseparable from agency\nwithin it. This general idea has attracted a remarkably rich and at\ntimes contrary range of interpretations, including: that all\nphilosophical concepts should be tested via scientific\nexperimentation, that a claim is true if and only if it is useful\n(relatedly: if a philosophical theory does not contribute directly to\nsocial progress then it is not worth much), that experience consists\nin transacting with rather than representing nature, that articulate\nlanguage rests on a deep bed of shared human practices that can never\nbe fully \u2018made explicit\u2019. \n\nPragmatism originated in the United States around 1870, and now\npresents a growing third alternative to both analytic and\n\u2018Continental\u2019 philosophical traditions worldwide. Its\nfirst generation was initiated by the so-called \u2018classical\npragmatists\u2019 Charles Sanders Peirce (1839\u20131914), who first\ndefined and defended the view, and his close friend and colleague\nWilliam James (1842\u20131910), who further developed and ably\npopularized it. James\u2019 Harvard colleague Josiah Royce\n(1855\u20131916), although officially allied with absolute idealism,\nproved a valuable interlocutor for many of these ideas. A significant\ninfluence in those early years was the scientific revolution then\ntaking place around evolutionary theory, of which first generation\npragmatists were keen observers and sometime participants (Pearce\n2020). These pragmatists focused significantly on theorising inquiry,\nmeaning and the nature of truth, although James put these themes to\nwork exploring truth in religion. A second (still termed\n\u2018classical\u2019) generation turned pragmatist philosophy more\nexplicitly towards politics, education and other dimensions of social\nimprovement, under the immense influence of John Dewey\n(1859\u20131952) and his friend Jane Addams (1860\u20131935) \u2013\nwho invented the profession of social work as an expression of\npragmatist ideas (and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931). Also\nof considerable importance at this time was George Herbert Mead\n(1863\u20131931), who contributed significantly to the social\nsciences, developing pragmatist perspectives upon the relations\nbetween the self and the community (Mead 1934), whilst philosophy of\nrace was germinated by pioneering African-American philosophers W.E.B\nDu Bois (1868\u20131963) and Alain Locke (1885\u20131954), who also\nengaged in productive dialogue with one another. As the progressive\nDeweyan \u2018New Deal\u2019 era passed away and the US moved into\nthe Cold War, pragmatism\u2019s influence was challenged, as analytic\nphilosophy blossomed and became the dominant methodological\norientation in most Anglo-American philosophy departments.\nTransitional or \u2018third generation\u2019 figures included C.I.\nLewis (1883\u20131964) and W.V.O. Quine (1908\u20132000); although\nthese philosophers developed a number of pragmatist themes, their\nanalytic allegiance may be seen in their significant focus on theory\nof knowledge as first philosophy (which Dewey deprecated as \u2018the\nepistemological industry\u2019).\n\nFollowing this dip in popularity, since the 1970s the pragmatist\ntradition has undergone a significant revival. Richard Rorty\n(1931\u20132007) turned consciously to pragmatism to rectify what he\nsaw as mainstream epistemology\u2019s crucial mistake: naively\nconceiving of language and thought as \u2018mirroring\u2019 the\nworld. Rorty\u2019s bold and iconoclastic attacks on this\n\u2018representationalism\u2019 birthed a so-called\nneopragmatism to which a number of influential recent\nphilosophers have contributed (e.g. Hilary Putnam, Robert Brandom and\nHuw Price). Other pragmatists have objected to Rorty\u2019s blithe\ndismissal of truth as a topic better left undiscussed (Rorty 1982),\nand have sought to rehabilitate classical pragmatist ideals of\nobjectivity (e.g. Susan Haack, Christopher Hookway and Cheryl Misak).\nThese philosophers are now sometimes referred to as New\nPragmatists. Yet others have worked to place pragmatist ideas in a\nbroader Western philosophical context, for instance tracing\nPeirce\u2019s significant debt to Kant (Apel 1974, Gava 2014), and\nconnections between pragmatism and 19th century idealism (Margolis\n2010, Stern 2009). Meanwhile, classical pragmatism\u2019s progressive\nsocial ideals lived on in some quarters, with notable contributions to\nphilosophy of race made by Cornel West, who advanced a prophetic\npragmatism drawing on both Christian and Marxian thought, and\nshowcasing the earlier contributions of Du Bois and Locke (e.g. West\n1989). A number of other liberatory philosophical projects in areas\nsuch as feminism (Seigfried 1996), ecology (Alexander 2013), Native\nAmerican philosophy (Pratt 2002) and Latin American philosophy (Pappas\n1998) also currently look to the pragmatist tradition as their\nphilosophical home. \n\nMeanwhile, increasingly pragmatism\u2019s intellectual centre of\ngravity is moving out of North America, with vibrant research networks\nappearing in South America, Scandinavia and more recently central\nEurope and China. \n\nThe core of pragmatism as Peirce originally conceived it was the\nPragmatic Maxim, a rule for clarifying the meaning of hypotheses by\ntracing their \u2018practical consequences\u2019 \u2013 their\nimplications for experience in specific situations. For Peirce and\nJames, a key application of the Maxim was clarifying the concept of\ntruth. This produced a distinctive epistemological outlook: a\nfallibilist, anti-Cartesian explication of the norms that govern\ninquiry. Within that broad outlook, though, early pragmatists split\nsignificantly over questions of realism broadly conceived\n\u2013 essentially, whether pragmatism should conceive itself as a\nscientific philosophy holding monism about truth (following Peirce),\nor a more broad-based alethic pluralism (following James and Dewey).\nThis dispute was poignantly emblematized in arguments between Peirce\nand James which led Peirce to rename his view pragmaticism,\npresenting this clarified viewpoint to the world as his new\n\u2018baby\u2019 which was, he hoped, \u2018ugly enough to be safe\nfrom kidnappers\u2019 (EP2: 355).\n\nThe first part of this entry is devoted to the classical\npragmatists\u2019 distinctive methods, and how they give rise to an\noriginal a posteriori epistemology. After that we will briefly\nexplore some of the many other areas of philosophy in which rich\npragmatist contributions have been made.\n",
