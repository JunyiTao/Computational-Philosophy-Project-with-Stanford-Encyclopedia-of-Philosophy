    "main_text": "Relativity and reference frames in classical mechanics || The emergence of the concept of inertial frame\n1.6 The emergence of the concept of inertial frame\n\nNeumann\u2019s definition of a time-scale directly inspired Ludwig\nLange\u2019s conception of \u201cinertial system\u201d (Lange\n1885). An inertial coordinate system ought to be one in which free\nparticles move in straight lines. But any trajectory may be stipulated\nto be rectilinear, and a coordinate system can always be constructed\nin which it is rectilinear. And so, as in the case of the time-scale,\nwe cannot adequately define an inertial system by the motion of one\nparticle. Indeed, for any two particles moving anyhow, a coordinate\nsystem may be found in which both their trajectories are rectilinear.\nSo far the claim that either particle, or some third particle, is\nmoving in a straight line may be said to be a matter of convention. We\nmust define an inertial system as one in which at least three free\nparticles move in straight lines. Then we can state the law of inertia\nas the claim that, relative to an inertial system so defined, the\nmotion of any fourth particle, or arbitrarily many particles, will be\nrectilinear. The notions of inertial system and Neumann\u2019s\ntime-scale, which Lange called an \u201cinertial time-scale,\u201d\nmay be combined as follows: relative to a coordinate system in which\nthree free particles move in straight lines and travel\nmutually-proportional distances, the motion of any fourth free\nparticle will be rectilinear and uniform. The questionable Newtonian\nconcepts of absolute rotation and acceleration, Lange proposed, could\nnow be replaced by the concepts of \u201cinertial rotation\u201d and\n\u201cinertial acceleration,\u201d i.e. rotation and acceleration\nrelative to an inertial system and inertial time-scale. See Figures 2\nand 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n(a)\n(b) \n\n\nFigure 2: Neumann\u2019s Time-Scale By\nNewton\u2019s first law, a particle not subject to forces travels\nequal distances in equal times. But which particles are free of\nforces? This might appear to be a matter of convention.\n\n(a) Either \\(P_1\\) or \\(P_2\\) can be arbitrarily stipulated to be at\nthe origin of a system of coordinates, and to serve as the measure of\nequal times\n\n(b) But one can say of two particles with different velocities: in\nintervals of time in which one moves a given distance \\(d_1\\), the\nother moves a proportional distance \\(d_2 = kd_1\\) (where k is\na constant; i.e., \\(d_1/d_2 = k\\)). Or one can compare a particle to a\nfreely rotating planet: in intervals of time through which the planet\nrotates through equal angles, the particle moves equal distances. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Lange\u2019s Definition of\n\u2018inertial system\u2019 (1885) An inertial system is a\ncoordinate system with respect to which three free particles,\nprojected from a single point and moving in non-coplanar directions,\nmove in straight lines and travel mutually-proportional distances. The\nlaw of inertia then states that relative to any inertial system, any\nfourth free particle will move uniformly. \n\n\nAt about the same time, apparently unaware of the work of Mach,\nNeumann, and Lange, James Thomson\u2014older brother of William\nThomson, Lord Kelvin\u2014expressed the content of the law of\ninertia, and the appropriate frame of reference and time-scale\n(\u201cdial-traveller\u201d), in a somewhat simpler manner:\n\nFor any set of bodies acted on each by any force, a REFERENCE FRAME\nand a REFERENCE DIAL-TRAVELLER are kinematically possible, such that\nrelatively to them conjointly, the motion of the mass-centre of each\nbody, undergoes change simultaneously with any infinitely short\nelement of the dial-traveller progress, or with any element during\nwhich the force on the body does not alter in direction nor in\nmagnitude, which change is proportional to the intensity of the force\nacting on that body, and to the simultaneous progress of the\ndial-traveller, and is made in the direction of the force. (Thomson\n1884, p. 387)\n\n\nThomson did not reject the term \u201cabsolute rotation\u201d.\nInstead, he held that it is properly defined as rotation relative to a\nframe that satisfies his definition of a reference frame. A body that\nis rotating with respect to a reference frame (and dial-traveller) is\nrotating with respect to any other frame in uniform motion relative to\nthe first. The definition does not express, as Lange\u2019s does, the\ndegree of arbitrariness involved in the construction of an inertial\nsystem by means of free particles. By dispensing with the idealization\nof free particles, Thomson\u2019s definition aims to characterize an\ninertial frame for an actual system of interacting bodies. However, it\ndoes not quite fulfill its aim. Like Lange\u2019s definition, it\nleaves out a crucial condition for an inertial system as we understand\nit: all forces must belong to action-reaction pairs. Otherwise we\ncould have, as on a rotating sphere, merely apparent (centrifugal)\nforces that are, by definition, proportional to mass and acceleration,\nand so the rotating sphere would satisfy Thomson\u2019s definition.\nTherefore the definition needs to be completed by the stipulation that\nto every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. (This\ncompletion was actually proposed by R.F. Muirhead in 1887.) \n\nBut, so completed, Thomson\u2019s definition makes the essential\npoint about the relation between Newton\u2019s laws of motion and the\ninertial frames: that the laws assert the existence of at least one\ninertial frame. If one inertial frame is posited, in which\naccelerations properly correspond to Newtonian forces, then any other\ninertial frame is in uniform motion with respect to the first; the\nforces, masses, and accelerations measured in one will have the same\nmeasures in any other. Any one may be arbitrarily designated as an\nall-encompassing \u201cimmobile space\u201d in which all others are\nmoving uniformly. Thus the original question, \u201crelative to what\nframe of reference do the laws of motion hold?\u201d is revealed to\nbe wrongly posed. For the laws of motion essentially\ndetermine a class of reference frames, and (in principle) a\nprocedure for constructing them. For the same reason, a skeptical\nquestion that is still commonly asked about the laws of\nmotion\u2014why is it that the laws are true only relative to a\ncertain choice of reference frame?\u2014is also wrongly posed. If\nNewton\u2019s laws are true, then we can construct an inertial frame;\ntheir truth doesn\u2019t depend on our ability to construct such a\nframe in advance. Mach expressed the situation particularly\nclearly:\n\nIt is very much the same whether we refer the laws of motion to\nabsolute space, or express them abstractly, without express indication\nof the system of reference. The latter course is unproblematic and\npractical, for in treating particular cases the student of mechanics\nlooks for a suitable system of reference. But owing to the fact that\nthe first way, whenever there was any actual issue at stake, was\nnearly always interpreted as having the same meaning as the latter,\nNewton\u2019s error was much less dangerous than it would otherwise\nhave been. (1933, p. 269.)\n\n\nMach\u2019s remark roughly corresponds to Newton\u2019s actual\nprocedure. Even though, for Newton, absolute space was the implicit\nreference-frame for stating the laws of motion, the frame for their\napplication was the standard one for most of the history of astronomy:\nthe fixed stars. This seemingly arbitrary starting-point did not\nundermine Newton\u2019s procedure as an account of the \u201ctrue\nmotions.\u201d For the framework of the fixed stars, initially taken\nfor granted, turns out to be justified in the course of Newton\u2019s\ndynamical analysis. If all the accelerations relative to the fixed\nstars can be analyzed into action-reaction pairs involving bodies\nwithin the system\u2014leaving no \u201cleftover\u201d\naccelerations that need to be traced to some yet-unknown\ninfluence\u2014then we can conclude that the stars are a suitable\n(sufficiently inertial) frame of reference after all. Newton could\nappeal to a particular case to test this general point: the orbits of\nthe outer planets were stable with respect to the fixed stars, their\nperihelia showing no measurable precession (unlike the perihelion of\nMercury, for a famous example). Newton argued, then, that a relative\nspace in which these apsides are stable is a sufficient approximation\nto a space at rest or in uniform motion (cf. Book III, Proposition\nXIV, 1687b, p. 420). \n\nMach took particular notice of Newton\u2019s use of the relativity\nprinciple in determining an appropriate reference-frame:\n\nIn order to have a generally valid system of reference, Newton\nintroduced Corollary V of the Principia. He thought\nof\u2026 a coordinate system for which the law of inertia holds,\nfixed in space without rotation relative to the fixed stars. He could\nalso allow an arbitrary origin and uniform translation of this\nsystem\u2026 without losing its usefulness\u2026 One can see that\nthe reduction to absolute space was in no way necessary, since the\nreference frame is just as relatively determined as in any other case.\n(1933, p. 227.)\n\n\nFor Mach, this was an important acknowledgement of Newton\u2019s\ninsight into the relativity of motion. Starting from Corollary V, the\nconcept of the inertial frame solved the problem of absolute rotation\nand acceleration, as a problem internal to the system of\nNewton\u2019s laws. Absolute space could be dispensed with, without\nundermining Newton\u2019s dynamical distinctions among states of\nmotion. Of course, this point did not dismiss Mach\u2019s skeptical\nquestions regarding the laws themselves. Instead, it posed them in a\nmore precise form: Are Newton\u2019s laws truly general laws of\nnature, that determine a class of privileged frames? Or do they only\ndescribe motions relative to a particular material frame, the fixed\nstars? Empirical evidence was insufficient to decide. Eventually\nMach\u2019s question helped to motivate Einstein\u2019s search for\nnew laws in which privileged frames would not play an essential role.\nFirst, however, by comparing Newtonian mechanics with Maxwell\u2019s\nelectrodynamics, Einstein placed the notion of inertial frame on an\nentirely new footing (see below,\n Section 2.2\net seq.). \n",
