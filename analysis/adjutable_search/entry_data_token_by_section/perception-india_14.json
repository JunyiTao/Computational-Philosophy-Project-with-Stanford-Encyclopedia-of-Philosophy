    "main_text": "Constructing Concepts or Knowing Universals?\n5. Perceptual Illusion\n\nThe skeptics challenge strikes at the claim made by the\nNaiy\u0101yikas that perception should be non-erroneous\n(avyabhich\u0101ri) and well-ascertained or free from doubt\n(vyavas\u0101y\u0101tmaka). They ask: how do we distinguish\nbetween veridical perceptions and the non-veridical ones? In case of a\nperceptual doubt, say, seeing something at a distance which looks like\na pole or an old tree-trunk, we are uncertain which it is but are\na priori sure it cannot be both. In case of perceptual\nillusion, I see a snake but I misperceive as there is only a rope in\nfront of me. Illusoriness of the experience (seeing a snake) is\nexposed with reference to another veridical experience (seeing a\nrope), but again, we are a priori sure that both cannot be\ntrue together. Then, the Buddhist skeptic, Vasubandhu, raises the ante\nwith the question: could they not both be false simultaneously? The\nskeptical argument is premised on a denial of the realist thesis that\nexperiences refer to a mind-independent reality. Vasubandhu\u2019s\nargument for idealism appears right at the beginning of\nVim\u015batik\u0101, when he states:\n\nThis [the external world] is consciousness only, because there is\nappearance of non-existent things, just as a person with cataracts\nsees non-existent hairs, moons et cetera. (Feldman, 2005, p. 529).\n\n\nVasubandhu offers many other examples of dreams, delusions,\nhallucinations, etc., where we are aware of non-existent objects that\nare products of our imagination and not objects external to the mind.\nIf it is possible for awareness to create its own object and then\ngrasp it (as in a dream) then, Vasubandhu argues, everything that we\nseem to be aware of could be a making of awareness.\n\nThe standard reply to this view appeals to the intuition that illusory\nexperience is parasitic on veridical experience. The Naiy\u0101yika,\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana explains that an erroneous cognition depends on a\nprincipal cognition as its basis. \u201cThis is a man\u201d for a\ntree-trunk, which is not a man, has for its basis a principal\ncognition of a man. If a man has never been perceived in the past, an\nerroneous cognition of a man, in what is not a man, can never be\nproduced (Ny\u0101ya-S\u016btra-Bh\u0101\u1e63ya, 4.2.35). A\nsimilar argument is put forth by the Advaita-Vedanta founder\n\u015aankara. He challenges Vasubandhu\u2019s view on the ground that\nit is incoherent; when the Buddhists say \u201cthat which is the\ncontent of an internal awareness appears as though\nexternal,\u201d they are\n\nassuming the existence of an external thing even while they deny it\n\u2026 For they use the phrase \u2018as though\u2019 \u2026\nbecause they become aware of a cognition appearing externally \u2026\nFor nobody speaks thus: Vi\u1e63numitra appears like the son of a\nbarren woman. (Brahma-S\u016btra-Bh\u0101\u1e63ya, 2.2.28)\n\n\nFeldman (2005, p. 534) argues that this does not suffice to defeat\nVasubandhu\u2019s idealism. The illusory experience of x, no\ndoubt requires a memory impression which can be produced by a previous\ncognition, but there is no further requirement that the previous\nexperience be veridical, because such impressions can be produced by\nillusory experiences. Feldman uses the case of someone who has only\nexperienced snakes in dreams. He can mistake a rope for a snake,\nbecause the previous dream experience provides the necessary memory\nimpression. Feldman\u2019s argument ignores the gravity of the\nconcern raised by V\u0101tsy\u0101yana and \u015aankara, however. They\nreject Vasubandhu\u2019s argument on the grounds that we cannot\nimagine (dream, hallucinate, etc) an absolutely unreal thing, like a\nbarren woman\u2019s son. The Ny\u0101ya theory of imagination,\nworking in the background here, says that to imagine something is to\nsuperimpose or attribute properties belonging to one kind of thing to\na thing of different kind, provided that there is some resemblance\nbetween the two kinds of objects (Uddyotakara\u2019s\nNy\u0101ya-S\u016btra-Bh\u0101\u1e63ya, 3.1.1). For example,\nto imagine a centaur is to attribute a property belonging to the\nhuman-kind to a thing of the horse-kind. There is some general\nresemblance between the two kinds: both are animals and have legs.\nHowever, an \u2018absolutely unreal\u2019 thing can have no\nproperties, and hence a fortiori no properties in common with\nan existing thing. They, therefore, cannot be an object of\nimagination.\n\nUddyotakara presents an even stronger argument against the skeptics.\nIn his Ny\u0101ya-V\u0101rttika he turns Vasubandhu\u2019s\nown argument against him. Uddyotakara asks: how do we know that the\nobject of a dream experience is non-existent? Vasubandhu accepts that\nthe dreamer does not know that he is dreaming; the knowledge that the\nobject is non-existent occurs only when he awakens and no longer\napprehends the object. If non-apprehension of an object in the waking\nstate is required to support the claim that the objects of dream\nexperience do not really exist out there, then apprehension in the\nwaking state must be an indicator of their existence, otherwise there\nwould be no contrast between what is apprehended and what is not\n(Ny\u0101ya-V\u0101rttika, 4.2.33). If there is no such\ncontrast, then Vasubandhu\u2019s argument fails because there is no\nsupport for the claim that objects of dream experiences do not exist\nin the external world. And, if there is such a contrast between\napprehension and non-apprehension, then at least some external objects\nmust exist. Clearly, Vasubandhu\u2019s argument for thesis of\nuniversal delusion (or idealism) does not succeed completely, nor are\nthe realists totally defeated.\n\nWe close this entry on the note that S\u016btra-s were\nprimarily composed in the seven centuries from 5th BCE to\n2nd CE and, thereafter, for the next millennium and more,\nthe philosophical work was carried forward by S\u016btra\ncommentators (tik\u0101k\u0101r-s) from respective schools.\nThis latter period saw these epistemological debates rage among\nscholars from these schools. Note also that there is no consensus on\nthe dates given here; most Western scholars accept these, while Indian\nschools place them further back in antiquity.\n",
