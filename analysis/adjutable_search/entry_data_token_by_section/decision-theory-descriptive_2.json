First, one introduces a relation of \u201csubjective\ncomparative probability\u201d \\(\\unrhd\\), such that \\(A\\unrhd B\\) iff\nfor all outcomes \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) such that \\(x_1\\succ x_2\\),\n\\(x_1Ax_2\\succeq x_2Ax_1\\) iff \\(x_1Bx_2\\succeq x_2Bx_1\\).\nSavage\u2019s axioms can then be shown to ensure that \\(\\unrhd\\)\nsatisfies a number of appropriate properties, with Small Event\nContinuity ensuring that \\(\\unrhd\\) is representable by a subjective\nprobability function \\(P\\) that is unique. It is worth noting that, in\nthe presence of Weak Comparative Probability, it is mainly the\nSure-Thing principle that allows the derivation of the additivity\nproperty of \\(P\\).\n\nSecond, using these axioms again, it can then be established that an\nagent is indifferent between any two acts that, for each outcome,\nassign equal probabilities to the respective sets of states that they\neach map onto that outcome. In other words:\n\n\nState Neutrality If \\(P_f=P_g\\), then \\(f\\sim g\\),\nwhere \\(P_f(x_i) = P(E^f_i)\\).\n\n\nSince it can also be shown that, for every lottery \\(P\\) in\n\\(\\mathcal{P}\\), there exists an act \\(f\\) such that \\(P_f=P\\), the\nimportant upshot of this result is that one can effectively simplify\nthe representation of the agent\u2019s preferences over acts,\nrecasting them as preferences over the smaller set \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) of\nso-called subjective lotteries, i.e., subjective probability\ndistributions over outcomes. To simplify notation, the preference\nrelation over \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) will be denoted by the same symbol,\n\\(\\succeq\\), allowing context to disambiguate.\n\nA further application of the axioms lets us establish that these\npreferences over lotteries satisfy three important properties: (i) a\n\u201cMixture Weak Order\u201d condition, requiring the preferences\nover lotteries to be transitive and complete, (ii) a \u201cMixture\nContinuity\u201d condition, the details of which are not of\nimportance here and finally (iii) an \u201cIndependence\u201d\ncondition, which, alongside the ordering condition, will be the focus\nof considerable discussion in what follows.\n\nTo present this last condition, one more definition is required,\nalongside a piece of notation: For any two lotteries \\(P_f\\) and\n\\(P_g\\) and \\(\\lambda\\in[0,1]\\), one can define a third simple lottery\n\\(\\lambda P_f + (1-\\lambda)P_g\\) in \\(\\mathcal{P}\\), the\n\\(\\lambda\\)-mixture of \\(P_f\\) and \\(P_g\\), by setting \\((\\lambda P_f\n+ (1-\\lambda)P_g)(x)\\), the probability assigned to outcome \\(x\\) by\nthe mixture lottery, equal to \\(\\lambda P_f(x) + (1-\\lambda)P_g(x)\\).\nIt is heuristically useful to think of \\(\\lambda P_f +\n(1-\\lambda)P_g\\) as a higher-order lottery that yields a probability\nof \\(\\lambda\\) of playing lottery \\(P_f\\) and a complementary\nprobability of playing \\(P_g\\). The condition then reads:\n\n\nIndependence For all acts \\(f, g\\) and \\(h\\) and all\n\\(\\lambda\\in(0,1]\\): \\(P_f\\succeq P_g\\) iff \\(\\lambda P_f +\n(1-\\lambda) P_h\\succeq \\lambda P_g + (1-\\lambda) P_h\\).\n\n\nThe proof is then completed by appealing to a result of von Neumann\nand Morgenstern (1947), which shows that the aforementioned trio of\nproperties is necessary and sufficient for the representability of\n\\(\\succeq\\) by a function \\(U\\) such that  \n\n\\[U(P_f)=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}P_f(x_i)u(x_i),\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(u : \\mathcal{X}\\mapsto \\mathbb{R}\\) is a consequence utility\nfunction unique up to positive linear transformation.\n",
