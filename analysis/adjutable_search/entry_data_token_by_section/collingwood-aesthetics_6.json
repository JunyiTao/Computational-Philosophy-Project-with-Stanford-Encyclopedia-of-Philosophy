    "main_text": "A Theory of Expressive Imagination\n4. A Theory of Expressive Imagination\n\nNot a great deal hangs on that thesis, at any rate. A great deal more\nhangs on the thesis that art essentially exercises the expressive\nimagination. The difference between the imagined lecture and the tune\nis that the content of the lecture is verbal and cognitive, and brings\nthose departments of mind into play; whilst the tune, among other\nthings, brings the emotional department of the mind much more vividly\ninto play. The substance of Collingwood\u2019s view is largely\ndependent on his account of this distinction.\n\nAt the most basic level Collingwood distinguishes thinking from\nfeeling. The objects of each, respectively, are thoughts and\n\u2018sensa\u2019: \u2018sensa\u2019 is Collingwood\u2019s name\nfor all the data of the senses\u2014of touch, smell, sight, and so\non. Thoughts can be true or false, justified or not, where sensa have\nno such duality: they are felt or not felt, but cannot contradict each\nother. There is sense in which sensa can be said to be real or unreal,\ntrue or false (for example in hallucination), but this not an\nintrinsic feature of sensa themselves; that distinction applies only\nto thoughts involving them. A first point that is directly relevant to\nthe theory of expression is that probably all sensa have an emotional\n\u2018charge\u2019. Thus for example every colour carries with it a\ncertain emotional quality. Not that they are invariably experienced\nwith their particular emotional charge; the charge is more like a\ndisposition to be experienced a certain way, under certain\ncircumstances. Children or artists are more likely to experience them;\neducated adult Europeans, Collingwood says, tend to have rather\n\u2018sterilized\u2019 experience.\n\nSensa are occurrent phenomena, and therefore fleeting (222): If I hear\nthe bell striking the hour of four, the experience comprises many\npassing sensa, each no sooner generated than gone. But if I am to be\naware of them as a process extended in time with particular\nmorphology, I must retain the sound of the bell, along with the\nsilences in between. The objects that I so retain cannot be the sensa\nthemselves. Instead, the faculty of \u2018conscious attention\u2019\ngenerates \u2018ideas\u2019 corresponding to the sensa, and which\nare retained. Sensa alone\u2014or sense data, or\nimpressions\u2014are never sufficient for consciousness. Collingwood\ncites Kant approvingly in the connection; noting that we have always\nto \u2018fill in\u2019 occurrent perception to generate a complete\nworld of 3-D objects, he writes:\n\nMoreover (this is a point Kant has made), it is only so far as I\nimagine them that I am aware of the matchbook as a solid body at all.\nA person who could really see, but could not imagine, would see not a\nsolid world of bodies of bodies, but merely (as Berkeley has it)\n\u2018various colours variously disposed\u2019. Thus, as Kant says,\nimagination is an \u2018indispensable function\u2019 for our\nknowledge of the world around us. (192)\n\n\nWhen one is conscious of a feeling of anger, one is aware of it as\none\u2019s own. By becoming conscious of it\u2014therefore not of\nthe sensation of anger but the anger transformed by\nconsciousness\u2014what we feel \u2018is correspondingly\nchanged\u2019 (207); the \u2018effect of this experience \u2026 is\nmake them less violent\u2019 (209). And another word for this is\nimagination. \u2018We become able to perpetuate feeling \u2026 at\nwill\u2019 (209). \u2018Imagination is thus the new form which\nfeeling takes when transformed by the activity of consciousness\u2019\n(215). With this level of consciousness comes the beginning of\nself-consciousness; \u2018it is assertion of ourselves as the owners\nof our feeling\u2019 (222; feeling that is \u2018as modified by\nconsciousness\u2019). But imagination, since it deals not with sensa\nbut with their ideated analogues, is a type of thought, and with the\nintroduction of thought comes the possibility of error. Thus if the\nbasic action of the consciousness is to think \u2018This is how I\nfeel\u2019, its denial is \u2018This is not how I feel\u2019 (216).\nThe possibility of such disowned feeling is the possibility of false,\nor corrupt consciousness (217).\n\nThought is established by the intellect, but there are two, separable\nroles of thought called \u2018primary\u2019 and\n\u2018secondary\u2019. Its primary role is to \u2018apprehend or\nconstruct relations\u2019 (216) amongst ideas, as just described (in\nfact Collingwood thinks in such relations the relata are fused in a\nnew idea comprising a \u2018peculiar colouring or modification of the\nold\u2019 (223)). The secondary role is to apprehend or construct\n\u2018relations between acts of primary intellection\u2019; by this\nCollingwood means conceptions of the past, future, the possible etc.,\nand presumably all that content of human thought which can not be\naccounted for in terms of the imagination.\n",
