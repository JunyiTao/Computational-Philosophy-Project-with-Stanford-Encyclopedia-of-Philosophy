    "main_text": "Does the Species Category Exist?\n5. Does the Species Category Exist?\n\nThere is another aspect of species pluralism worth discussing. Suppose\none accepts species pluralism. The term \u2018species\u2019 then\nrefers to different types of lineages. Some species are groups of\ninterbreeding organisms, other species are groups of organisms that\nshare a common ecological niche, and still other species are\nphylogenetic units. Given that there are different types of species,\none might wonder what feature causes these different types of species\nto be species?\n\nPerhaps they share a common property that renders them species. If one\nadopts the thesis that all species are genealogical lineages, then a\ncommon feature of species is their being lineages. However, this\nfeature is also shared by other types of taxa in the Linnaean\nHierarchy. From an evolutionary perspective, all taxa, whether they be\nspecies, genera, or tribes, are genealogical lineages. We need to\nlocate a feature that is not only common in species but also\ndistinguishes species from other types of taxa.\n\nBiological taxonomists often talk in terms of the patterns and\nprocesses of evolution. Perhaps there is a process or a pattern that\noccurs in species but not in other types of taxa. Such a process or\npattern would unify the types of lineages we call\n\u2018species.\u2019 Let us start with process. The Biological\nSpecies Concept highlights those species bound by the process of\ninterbreeding. The Ecological Species Concept identifies those species\nunified by stabilizing selection. The species highlighted by\nPhylogenetic Species Concepts are unified by such historical processes\nas genetic and developmental homeostasis. A survey of these different\nspecies concepts reveals that species are bound by different types of\nprocesses. So no single type of process is common to all species.\nArguably, none of these processes are unique to species either\n(Mishler and Donoghue 1982).\n\nWhat about pattern? Do species display a pattern that distinguishes\nthem from other types of taxa? If by pattern we mean ontological\nstructure, then species have different patterns. Species are\nindividuals, but they are different types of individuals. Species of\nasexual organisms and species of sexual organisms have different\nstructures. Both types of species contain organisms that are\ngenealogically connected to a common ancestor. But the organisms in a\nsexual species are also connected by interbreeding. Thus species of\nsexual organisms form causally integrated entities: within a given\ngeneration, their members exchange genetic material through sexual\nreproduction. Species of asexual organisms do not form causally\nintegrated entities: their organisms are merely connected to a common\nancestor.\n\nThere are other suggestions for the common and unique pattern of\nspecies. Many observe that the organisms of a species often look the\nsame or that the organisms of a species share a cluster of reoccurring\nproperties. To the extent that this is true, it is also true of genera\nand some other higher taxa. The members of some genera tend to look\nthe same and have a cluster of stable properties. Another suggestion\nfor the pattern that distinguishes species is their ability to evolve\nas a unit\u2014species are the units of evolution, other types of\ntaxa are not. But again, many higher taxa have such unity as well\n(Mishler and Donoghue 1982).\n\nThe above survey of candidate unifying features is far from\nexhaustive. But the result is clear enough. Species vary in their\nunifying processes and ontological structure. Furthermore, many\nfeatures that biologists and philosophers highlight as unique to\nspecies occur in many higher taxa as well. Given this survey, what\nposition should we adopt concerning the nature of species? There are\nseveral options. According to one option we should keep looking for\nthe unifying feature of species. This is the option favored by some\nmonists (Sober 1984). Contemporary biology may not have discovered the\nunifying feature of species, but that does not mean that biology will\nnot find such a feature in the future. To give up the search for the\nunifying nature of species would be too hasty.\n\nAnother option starts with the assumption that the search for the\nunifying feature of species has gone on long enough. Biologists have\nlooked long and hard for the correct definition of\n\u2018species.\u2019 The result of that search is not that we do not\nknow what species are. The result is that the organic world contains\ndifferent types of species. The conclusion drawn by some pluralists\n(Kitcher 1984, Dupr\u00e9 1993) is that the term\n\u2018species\u2019 should be given a disjunctive definition.\nSpecies are either interbreeding lineages, or ecological lineages, or\nphylogenetic units, or \u2026.\n\nA third option, like the previous one, assumes that biologists have\nlooked long enough for the unifying feature of species. In that\nsearch, biology has learned that there are different types of lineages\ncalled \u2018species.\u2019 But proponents (Ereshefsky 1998) of this\noption do not opt for a disjunctive definition of\n\u2018species.\u2019 According to this option, we should doubt the\nvery existence of the category species. Those lineages we call\n\u2018species\u2019 vary in their patterns and processes.\nFurthermore, the distinction between species and other types of taxa\nis riddled with vagueness. Consequently, we should doubt whether the\nterm \u2018species\u2019 refers to a real category in nature.\n\nTo better understand this third option it is useful to see more\nprecisely what is being doubted. Biologists make a distinction between\nthe species category and species taxa. Species taxa\nare the individual lineages we call \u2018species.\u2019 Homo\nsapiens and Canis familiaris are species taxa. The\nspecies category is a more inclusive entity. The species category is\nthe class of all species taxa. The third option does not call into\nquestion the existence of Homo sapiens or Canis\nfamiliaris or any other lineage that we call\n\u2018species.\u2019 The third option just calls into question the\nexistence of the categorical rank of species. (For different\napproaches that call into question the existence of the species\ncategory, see Mishler and Wilkins 2018, and Haber 2019. For recent\ndefences of the reality of the species category see Currie 2016,\nBarker 2019a, Novak and Doolittle 2021.)\n",
