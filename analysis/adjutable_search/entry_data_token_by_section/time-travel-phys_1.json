    "main_text": "Topology and Constraints\n2. Topology and Constraints\n\nWheeler and Feynman (1949) were the first to claim that the fact that\nnature is continuous could be used to argue that causal influences\nfrom later events to earlier events, as are made possible by time\ntravel, will not lead to paradox without the need for any constraints.\nMaudlin (1990) showed how to make their argument precise and more\ngeneral, and argued that nonetheless it was not completely\ngeneral.\n\nImagine the following set-up. We start off having a camera with a\nblack and white film ready to take a picture of whatever comes out of\nthe time machine. An object, in fact a developed film, comes out of\nthe time machine. We photograph it, and develop the film. The\ndeveloped film is subsequently put in the time machine, and set to\ncome out of the time machine at the time the picture is taken. This\nsurely will create a paradox: the developed film will have the\nopposite distribution of black, white, and shades of gray, from the\nobject that comes out of the time machine. For developed black and\nwhite films (i.e., negatives) have the opposite shades of gray from\nthe objects they are pictures of. But since the object that comes out\nof the time machine is the developed film itself it we surely have a\nparadox.\n\nHowever, it does not take much thought to realize that there is no\nparadox here. What will happen is that a uniformly gray picture will\nemerge, which produces a developed film that has exactly the same\nuniform shade of gray. No matter what the sensitivity of the film is,\nas long as the dependence of the brightness of the developed film\ndepends in a continuous manner on the brightness of the object being\nphotographed, there will be a shade of gray that, when photographed,\nwill produce exactly the same shade of gray on the developed film.\nThis is the essence of Wheeler and Feynman\u2019s idea. Let us first\nbe a bit more precise and then a bit more general.\n\nFor simplicity let us suppose that the film is always a uniform shade\nof gray (i.e., at any time the shade of gray does not vary by location\non the film). The possible shades of gray of the film can then be\nrepresented by the (real) numbers from 0, representing pure black, to\n1, representing pure white.\n\nLet us now distinguish various stages in the chronological order of\nthe life of the film. In stage \\(S_1\\) the film is young; it has just\nbeen placed in the camera and is ready to be exposed. It is then\nexposed to the object that comes out of the time machine. (That object\nin fact is a later stage of the film itself). By the time we come to\nstage \\(S_2\\) of the life of the film, it has been developed and is\nabout to enter the time machine. Stage \\(S_3\\) occurs just after it\nexits the time machine and just before it is photographed. Stage\n\\(S_4\\) occurs after it has been photographed and before it starts\nfading away. Let us assume that the film starts out in stage \\(S_1\\)\nin some uniform shade of gray, and that the only significant change in\nthe shade of gray of the film occurs between stages \\(S_1\\) and\n\\(S_2\\). During that period it acquires a shade of gray that depends\non the shade of gray of the object that was photographed. In other\nwords, the shade of gray that the film acquires at stage \\(S_2\\)\ndepends on the shade of gray it has at stage \\(S_3\\). The influence of\nthe shade of gray of the film at stage \\(S_3\\), on the shade of gray\nof the film at stage \\(S_2\\), can be represented as a mapping, or\nfunction, from the real numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive), to the\nreal numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive). Let us suppose that the\nprocess of photography is such that if one imagines varying the shade\nof gray of an object in a smooth, continuous manner then the shade of\ngray of the developed picture of that object will also vary in a\nsmooth, continuous manner. This implies that the function in question\nwill be a continuous function. Now any continuous function from the\nreal numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive) to the real numbers between 0\nand 1 (inclusive) must map at least one number to itself. One can\nquickly convince oneself of this by graphing such functions. For one\nwill quickly see that any continuous function \\(f\\) from \\([0,1]\\) to\n\\([0,1]\\) must intersect the line \\(x=y\\) somewhere, and thus there\nmust be at least one point \\(x\\) such that \\(f(x)=x\\). Such points are\ncalled fixed points of the function. Now let us think about what such\na fixed point represents. It represents a shade of gray such that,\nwhen photographed, it will produce a developed film with exactly that\nsame shade of gray. The existence of such a fixed point implies a\nsolution to the apparent paradox.\n\nLet us now be more general and allow color photography. One can\nrepresent each possible color of an object (of uniform color) by the\nproportions of blue, green and red that make up that color. (This is\nwhy television screens can produce all possible colors.) Thus one can\nrepresent all possible colors of an object by three points on three\northogonal lines \\(x, y\\) and \\(z\\), that is to say, by a point in a\nthree-dimensional cube. This cube is also known as the\n\u201cCartesian product\u201d of the three line segments. Now, one\ncan also show that any continuous map from such a cube to itself must\nhave at least one fixed point. So color photography can not be used to\ncreate time travel paradoxes either!\n\nEven more generally, consider some system \\(P\\) which, as in the above\nexample, has the following life. It starts in some state \\(S_1\\), it\ninteracts with an object that comes out of a time machine (which\nhappens to be its older self), it travels back in time, it interacts\nwith some object (which happens to be its younger self), and finally\nit grows old and dies. Let us assume that the set of possible states\nof \\(P\\) can be represented by a Cartesian product of \\(n\\) closed\nintervals of the reals, i.e., let us assume that the topology of the\nstate-space of \\(P\\) is isomorphic to a finite Cartesian product of\nclosed intervals of the reals. Let us further assume that the\ndevelopment of \\(P\\) in time, and the dependence of that development\non the state of objects that it interacts with, is continuous. Then,\nby a well-known fixed point theorem in topology (see, e.g., Hocking\n& Young 1961: 273), no matter what the nature of the interaction\nis, and no matter what the initial state of the object is, there will\nbe at least one state \\(S_3\\) of the older system (as it emerges from\nthe time travel machine) that will influence the initial state \\(S_1\\)\nof the younger system (when it encounters the older system) so that,\nas the younger system becomes older, it develops exactly into state\n\\(S_3\\). Thus without imposing any constraints on the initial state\n\\(S_1\\) of the system \\(P\\), we have shown that there will always be\nperfectly ordinary, non-paradoxical, solutions, in which everything\nthat happens, happens according to the usual laws of development. Of\ncourse, there is looped causation, hence presumably also looped\nexplanation, but what do you expect if there is looped time?\n\nUnfortunately, for the fan of time travel, a little reflection\nsuggests that there are systems for which the needed fixed point\ntheorem does not hold. Imagine, for instance, that we have a dial that\ncan only rotate in a plane. We are going to put the dial in the time\nmachine. Indeed we have decided that if we see the later stage of the\ndial come out of the time machine set at angle \\(x\\), then we will set\nthe dial to \\(x+90\\), and throw it into the time machine. Now it seems\nwe have a paradox, since the mapping that consists of a rotation of\nall points in a circular state-space by 90 degrees does not have a\nfixed point. And why wouldn\u2019t some state-spaces have the\ntopology of a circle?\n\nHowever, we have so far not used another continuity assumption which\nis also a reasonable assumption. So far we have only made the\nfollowing demand: the state the dial is in at stage \\(S_2\\) must be a\ncontinuous function of the state of the dial at stage \\(S_3\\). But,\nthe state of the dial at stage \\(S_2\\) is arrived at by taking the\nstate of the dial at stage \\(S_1\\), and rotating it over some angle.\nIt is not merely the case that the effect of the interaction, namely\nthe state of the dial at stage \\(S_2\\), should be a continuous\nfunction of the cause, namely the state of the dial at stage \\(S_3\\).\nIt is additionally the case that path taken to get there, the way the\ndial is rotated between stages \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) must be a\ncontinuous function of the state at stage \\(S_3\\). And, rather\nsurprisingly, it turns out that this can not be done. Let us\nillustrate what the problem is before going to a more general\ndemonstration that there must be a fixed point solution in the dial\ncase.\n\nForget time travel for the moment. Suppose that you and I each have a\nwatch with a single dial neither of which is running. My watch is set\nat 12. You are going to announce what your watch is set at. My task is\ngoing to be to adjust my watch to yours no matter what announcement\nyou make. And my actions should have a continuous (single valued)\ndependence on the time that you announce. Surprisingly, this is not\npossible! For instance, suppose that if you announce \u201c12\u201d,\nthen I achieve that setting on my watch by doing nothing. Now imagine\nslowly and continuously increasing the announced times, starting at\n12. By continuity, I must achieve each of those settings by rotating\nmy dial to the right. If at some point I switch and achieve the\nannounced goal by a rotation of my dial to the left, I will have\nintroduced a discontinuity in my actions, a discontinuity in the\nactions that I take as a function of the announced angle. So I will be\nforced, by continuity, to achieve every announcement by rotating the\ndial to the right. But, this rotation to the right will have to be\nabruptly discontinued as the announcements grow larger and I\neventually approach 12 again, since I achieved 12 by not rotating the\ndial at all. So, there will be a discontinuity at 12 at the latest. In\ngeneral, continuity of my actions as a function of announced times can\nnot be maintained throughout if I am to be able to replicate all\npossible settings. Another way to see the problem is that one can\nsimilarly reason that, as one starts with 12, and imagines\ncontinuously making the announced times earlier, one will be forced,\nby continuity, to achieve the announced times by rotating the dial to\nthe left. But the conclusions drawn from the assumption of continuous\nincreases and the assumption of continuous decreases are inconsistent.\nSo we have an inconsistency following from the assumption of\ncontinuity and the assumption that I always manage to set my watch to\nyour watch. So, a dial developing according to a continuous dynamics\nfrom a given initial state, can not be set up so as to react to a\nsecond dial, with which it interacts, in such a way that it is\nguaranteed to always end up set at the same angle as the second dial.\nSimilarly, it can not be set up so that it is guaranteed to always end\nup set at 90 degrees to the setting of the second dial. All of this\nhas nothing to do with time travel. However, the impossibility of such\nset ups is what prevents us from enacting the rotation by 90 degrees\nthat would create paradox in the time travel setting.\n\nLet us now give the positive result that with such dials there will\nalways be fixed point solutions, as long as the dynamics is\ncontinuous. Let us call the state of the dial before it interacts with\nits older self the initial state of the dial. And let us call the\nstate of the dial after it emerges from the time machine the final\nstate of the dial. There is also an intermediate state of the dial,\nafter it interacts with its older self and before it is put into the\ntime machine. We can represent the initial or intermediate states of\nthe dial, before it goes into the time machine, as an angle \\(x\\) in\nthe horizontal plane and the final state of the dial, after it comes\nout of the time machine, as an angle \\(y\\) in the vertical plane. All\npossible \\(\\langle x,y\\rangle\\) pairs can thus be visualized as a\ntorus with each \\(x\\) value picking out a vertical circular\ncross-section and each \\(y\\) picking out a point on that\ncross-section. See\n figure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 [An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nSuppose that the dial starts at angle \\(i\\) which picks out vertical\ncircle \\(I\\) on the torus. The initial angle \\(i\\) that the dial is at\nbefore it encounters its older self, and the set of all possible final\nangles that the dial can have when it emerges from the time machine is\nrepresented by the circle \\(I\\) on the torus (see\n figure 1).\n Given any possible angle of the emerging dial, the dial initially at\nangle \\(i\\) will develop to some other angle. One can picture this\ndevelopment by rotating each point on \\(I\\) in the horizontal\ndirection by the relevant amount. Since the rotation has to depend\ncontinuously on the angle of the emerging dial, circle \\(I\\) during\nthis development will deform into some loop \\(L\\) on the torus. Loop\n\\(L\\) thus represents all possible intermediate angles \\(x\\) that the\ndial is at when it is thrown into the time machine, given that it\nstarted at angle \\(i\\) and then encountered a dial (its older self)\nwhich was at angle \\(y\\) when it emerged from the time machine. We\ntherefore have consistency if \\(x=y\\) for some \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) on loop\n\\(L\\). Now, let loop \\(C\\) be the loop which consists of all the\npoints on the torus for which \\(x=y\\). Ring \\(I\\) intersects \\(C\\) at\npoint \\(\\langle i,i\\rangle\\). Obviously any continuous deformation of\n\\(I\\) must still intersect \\(C\\) somewhere. So \\(L\\) must intersect\n\\(C\\) somewhere, say at \\(\\langle j,j\\rangle\\). But that means that no\nmatter how the development of the dial starting at \\(I\\) depends on\nthe angle of the emerging dial, there will be some angle for the\nemerging dial such that the dial will develop exactly into that angle\n(by the time it enters the time machine) under the influence of that\nemerging dial. This is so no matter what angle one starts with, and no\nmatter how the development depends on the angle of the emerging dial.\nThus even for a circular state-space there are no constraints needed\nother than continuity.\n\nUnfortunately there are state-spaces that escape even this argument.\nConsider for instance a pointer that can be set to all values between\n0 and 1, where 0 and 1 are not possible values. That is, suppose that\nwe have a state-space that is isomorphic to an open set of real\nnumbers. Now suppose that we have a machine that sets the pointer to\nhalf the value that the pointer is set at when it emerges from the\ntime machine.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 [An\n extended description of figure 2\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nSuppose the pointer starts at value \\(I\\). As before we can represent\nthe combination of this initial position and all possible final\npositions by the line \\(I\\). Under the influence of the pointer coming\nout of the time machine the pointer value will develop to a value that\nequals half the value of the final value that it encountered. We can\nrepresent this development as the continuous deformation of line \\(I\\)\ninto line \\(L\\), which is indicated by the arrows in\n figure 2.\n This development is fully continuous. Points \\(\\langle x,y\\rangle\\)\non line \\(I\\) represent the initial position \\(x=I\\) of the (young)\npointer, and the position \\(y\\) of the older pointer as it emerges\nfrom the time machine. Points \\(\\langle x,y\\rangle\\) on line \\(L\\)\nrepresent the position \\(x\\) that the younger pointer should develop\ninto, given that it encountered the older pointer emerging from the\ntime machine set at position \\(y\\). Since the pointer is designed to\ndevelop to half the value of the pointer that it encounters, the line\n\\(L\\) corresponds to \\(x=1/2 y\\). We have consistency if there is some\npoint such that it develops into that point, if it encounters that\npoint. Thus, we have consistency if there is some point \\(\\langle\nx,y\\rangle\\) on line \\(L\\) such that \\(x=y\\). However, there is no\nsuch point: lines \\(L\\) and \\(C\\) do not intersect. Thus there is no\nconsistent solution, despite the fact that the dynamics is fully\ncontinuous.\n\nOf course if 0 were a possible value, \\(L\\) and \\(C\\) would intersect\nat 0. This is surprising and strange: adding one point to the set of\npossible values of a quantity here makes the difference between\nparadox and peace. One might be tempted to just add the extra point to\nthe state-space in order to avoid problems. After all, one might say,\nsurely no measurements could ever tell us whether the set of possible\nvalues includes that exact point or not. Unfortunately there can be\ngood theoretical reasons for supposing that some quantity has a\nstate-space that is open: the set of all possible speeds of massive\nobjects in special relativity surely is an open set, since it includes\nall speeds up to, but not including, the speed of light. Quantities\nthat have possible values that are not bounded also lead to counter\nexamples to the presented fixed point argument. And it is not obvious\nto us why one should exclude such possibilities. So the argument that\nno constraints are needed is not fully general.\n\nAn interesting question of course is: exactly for which state-spaces\nmust there be such fixed points? The arguments above depend on a\nwell-known fixed point theorem (due to Schauder) that guarantees the\nexistence of a fixed point for compact, convex state spaces. We do not\nknow what subsequent extensions of this result imply regarding fixed\npoints for a wider variety of systems, or whether there are other\ngeneral results along these lines. (See Kutach 2003 for more on this\nissue.)\n\nA further interesting question is whether this line of argument is\nsufficient to resolve Consistency (see also Dowe 2007). When\nthey apply, these results establish the existence of a solution, such\nas the shade of uniform gray in the first example. But physicists\nroutinely demand more than merely the existence of a solution, namely\nthat solutions to the equations are stable\u2014such that\n\u201csmall\u201d changes of the initial state lead to\n\u201csmall\u201d changes of the resulting trajectory. (Clarifying\nthe two senses of \u201csmall\u201d in this statement requires\nfurther work, specifying the relevant topology.) Stability in this\nsense underwrites the possibility of applying equations to real\nsystems given our inability to fix initial states with indefinite\nprecision. (See Fletcher 2020 for further discussion.) The fixed point\ntheorems guarantee that for an initial state \\(S_1\\) there is a\nsolution, but this solution may not be \u201cclose\u201d to the\nsolution for a nearby initial state, \\(S'\\). We are not aware of any\nproofs that the solutions guaranteed to exist by the fixed point\ntheorems are also stable in this sense.\n",
