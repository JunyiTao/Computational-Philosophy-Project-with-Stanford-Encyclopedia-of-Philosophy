But does pantheism prescribe any specific\nethics? There are two respects in which pantheism might be thought to\nhave significant ethical implications.\n\nFirstly, for pantheism, there is no higher power, no external\nauthority to tell us what to do. Insofar as it rejects any sense of a\ntranscendent external lawgiver or\u2014to put the matter more\npositively\u2014insofar as it regards deity as the distributed\npossession of all, pantheism may be represented as endorsing the\nKantian doctrine of the autonomy of ethical judgement. But the\nimplications of this are open. It can lead to either democratic\ncommunitarian ethics or to individualism. Paradoxically, it might\nequally well result in a species of conservative conformity to\nwhatever is deemed to be the \u2018natural state\u2019 of the world\nevery bit as stifling to the human spirit as conformity to whatever is\ndeemed to be \u2018the will of God.\u2019\n\nSecondly, it may be argued that pantheism is able to give a\nparticularly strong ground for an ethic of altruism or compassion. To\nSchopenhauer (with whom this argument is particularly associated) only\ngenuinely altruistic or compassionate actions have moral worth, but\nonly pleasure and pain are capable of motivating the will, from which\nhe concludes that genuinely moral action is possible only if the\npleasure and pain of others can stir us to action as directly and\nimmediately as can our own pleasure and pain. It is not enough that we\nsympathetically imagine ourselves in their shoes, he argues; we must\nliterally feel the pleasure and pain of others as our own, an attitude\nthat will be rationally grounded only in a monistic metaphysics in\nwhich the distinction between ego and not ego becomes a trivial or\nillusory distinction between two manifestations of the same underlying\nunity (Schopenhauer 1839). Schopenhauer includes nonhuman animals in\nthis argument. To the charge that what is defended here remains but a\nspecies of egoism\u2014metaphysically enlarged, but still morally\nworthless\u2014it may be replied that self-concern is to be\ndeprecated only insofar as it is something that exists in contrast\nwith concern for others (a contrast which no longer finds any purchase\nin this scheme).\n",
