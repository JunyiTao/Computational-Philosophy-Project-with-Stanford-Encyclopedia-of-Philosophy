    "main_text": "\n\nDante\u2019s engagement with philosophy cannot be studied apart from\nhis vocation as a poet, in which capacity he sought to raise the level\nof public discourse by educating his countrymen and inspiring them to\npursue happiness in the contemplative life. He was one of the most\nlearned Italian laymen of his day, intimately familiar with\nAristotelian logic and natural philosophy, theology, and classical\nliterature. He is, of course, most famous for having written the\nDivine Comedy, but in his poetry as well as his philosophical\ntreatises and other writings, he freely mingles and synthesizes\nphilosophical and theological language as well extensive references\nand allusions to scripture and classical and contemporary poetry.\nWhile his contributions to world literature and other artistic genres\nare universally acknowledged, his theological imagination has also\nremained influential from his own time to the present day. His\nphilosophical legacy, by comparison, remains more difficult to assess,\nthough his writings provide, at the very least, a powerful tool for\nthe study of the landscape of late medieval and Renaissance\nphilosophy.\n",
