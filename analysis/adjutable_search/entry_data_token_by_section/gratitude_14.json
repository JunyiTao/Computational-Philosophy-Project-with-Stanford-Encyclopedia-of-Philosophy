    "main_text": "Gratitude and Obligation || Arguments For and Against Obligations of Gratitude\n5.1 Arguments For and Against Obligations of Gratitude\n\nIt is widely held that the cognitive and affective elements of the\ngrateful response cannot be obligatory. Most philosophers agree that\nin order for some \u03c8 to qualify as a moral obligation (in the\nstrict sense that there are moral obligations of promise-keeping),\n\u03c8 must be something over which an agent has direct control; and\ninsofar as agents do not have direct control over their beliefs and\nfeelings, they cannot have obligations to have grateful beliefs and\nfeelings (Berger 1975: 306; Simmons 1979: 166\u2013167; Camenisch\n1981: 11; McConnell 1993: 83). Two points are worth noting, however,\nregarding obligation and grateful feeling and belief. The first is\nthat even if beliefs and affects cannot be obligatory, the absence of\nsuch attitudes may still be blameworthy or\nreprehensible, at least insofar as we can be blamed or held\nresponsible for things beyond our direct control. A second point worth\nnoting is that we may have an obligation to cultivate such\nattitudes, insofar as trying to bring them about is within our direct\ncontrol (Dyck 1973: 48; Weiss 1985: 494).\n\nThanking seems a more plausible candidate for an obligation of\ngratitude than grateful affects and beliefs, since doing or saying the\nthings necessary to express, demonstrate or communicate one\u2019s\ngrateful attitudes appears to be within a beneficiary\u2019s direct\ncontrol. Against this, it might be argued that beneficiaries cannot\nhave an obligation to thank, since thanking implies sincere\nexpression, demonstration or communication of beliefs and affects, and\nwhether a beneficiary has these attitudes (and thus whether his thanks\nare sincere) is beyond his control. In response, it might be pointed\nout that certain \u201cexpressions\u201d seem sometimes to be\nobligatory, regardless of whether they are sincere. For instance, it\nseems plausible that offenders can be obligated to express contrition\nby apologizing for wrongs they\u2019ve done, even if they lack\napologetic beliefs and affects. It might also be pointed out that if\nthanking can serve as a commissive (see\n section 3.3),\n then thanking might be made sincere simply by forming the intention\nto develop grateful attitudes, if they are lacking at the time of\nthanks. Insofar as forming such an intention is within the direct\ncontrol of the beneficiary, the sincerity of thanks would be under his\ndirect control, and thanking might be a candidate for an obligation of\ngratitude.\n\nThe most plausible candidates for obligations of gratitude are\ninstances of grateful behavior (see\n section 3.4).\n Ordinary language seems to speak in favor of some of these behaviors\nbeing obligatory. The metaphor of debts of gratitude, which a\nbeneficiary pays to a benefactor by returning a favor, dates back\ncenturies, at least in the Anglophone linguistic tradition (Brandt\n1964: 386); and philosophers and writers throughout history have\ncondemned acts and omissions of ingratitude as among the most vicious\nof wrongs. Hume (1738 [2007]: III.I.I), for instance, wrote that\n\u201cOf all crimes that human creatures are capable of committing,\nthe most horrid and unnatural is ingratitude\u2026\u201d Kant wrote\nthat ingratitude was (along with envy and malice) \u201cthe essence\nof vileness and wickedness\u201d (Kant 1775\u20131780 [1981]). And\nSeneca (On Benefits) ranked ingrates below thieves, rapists\nand adulterers.\n\nObligation skeptics about gratitude present several arguments\nagainst the possibility that grateful behaviors can be obligatory. The\nfirst, which we might call the vagueness argument, says that\nwhile beneficiaries may have an obligation to return a favor upon a\nbenefactor at some point, the beneficiary has substantial latitude in\ndeciding when and how to bestow his grateful favor (Camenisch 1981:\n15\u201316; Fitzgerald 1998: 138). This latitude is consistent with\nhis having a certain sort of imperfect obligation (McConnell 1993);\nbut it does not amount to the sort of strict obligation had by a\npromisor or a debtor, who have little or no latitude in fulfilling\ntheir obligation by the agreed-upon time. In response to this,\nobligationists about gratitude (e.g., Manela 2015) have\npointed out that there are indeed certain acts of gratitude that seem\nto admit of no latitude\u2014specifically, acceding to a reasonable\nrequest from a benefactor in need or refraining from harming a\nbenefactor in certain ways that might be permissible if done to a\nstranger (see\n section 3.4.1).\n\nA second argument against the possibility of obligations of gratitude\nrelies on what is sometimes referred to as the correlativity\nthesis: if one person owes an obligation to another, then\nparadigmatically, the person to whom the obligation is owed has a\nright to the obligation\u2019s fulfillment, and thus has\nstanding to demand or exact fulfillment of the obligation. If\nY makes R a promise, for instance, then Y\nhas an obligation to R to keep the promise, and from this it\nfollows that R has a right that the promise be kept. If\nbeneficiaries had obligations of gratitude, the argument goes, these\nobligations would certainly be owed to their benefactors, and we would\nexpect benefactors to have a right to the fulfillment of such\nobligations. But no benefactor has a right to gratitude\u2014the\nstanding to demand or exact a return favor. Therefore, there are no\nobligations of gratitude (Wellman 1999b). Acts or omissions of\ningratitude, on this view, are not morally wrong or forbidden, though\nthey might be what Julia Driver (1992) calls\nsuberogatory\u2014bad to do, but not obligation-breaching\n(Wellman 1999b). In response to this argument, some obligationists\nabout gratitude have suggested modifying the correlativity thesis to\nallow that directed obligations need not entail standing to enforce or\nexact, but only standing to hold the obligee responsible in some\nweaker way. Darwall (2012), for instance, suggests that benefactors\ncan appropriately respond to ingratitude with a reactive attitude like\nresentment. Manela (2015) argues that benefactors can appropriately\nrespond to especially egregious instances of ingratitude by\nreproaching or remonstrating (though not demanding). He labels the\nstanding to remonstrate (though not demand) an \u201cimperfect\nright\u201d, and he holds that benefactors can have imperfect rights\nto certain acts of gratitude.\n\nTwo final arguments against the possibility of obligatory grateful\nbehavior concern the motivation and reasons on which the grateful\nbeneficiary acts. The first begins with the premise that acts of\ngratitude must be done spontaneously, or from natural inclination, in\norder to count as acts of gratitude. Moral obligations, however, are\nsupposed to be the sorts of things we can fulfill even if natural\ninclination is lacking, by exerting an effort of will. For example, I\ncan fulfill an obligation of justice even if I do not act from natural\ninclination, when I grudgingly repay a steep loan, for instance; and\nso it seems I can have obligations of justice. By contrast, the\npossibility of a moral obligation to laugh at a joke seems absurd, in\npart, because laughter is something that can only be done\nspontaneously or from natural inclination (Card 1988). Insofar as acts\nof gratitude must be done from natural inclination, the argument goes,\nsuch acts cannot be done by exerting an effort of will, and thus\ncannot be morally obligatory (Card 1988; Wellman 1999b). This argument\nmay be vulnerable to the objection that the initial premise (that acts\nof gratitude must be done from natural inclination to count as such)\nis false (see\n section 3.4.2).\n\nA final argument against the possibility of obligations of gratitude\nruns as follows: whether grateful acts must be done from natural\ninclination, beneficiaries must act from certain reasons in order for\ntheir actions to count as acts of gratitude (see\n section 3.4.2).\n But no one has direct control over what reasons he acts from (Ross\n2002). Beneficiaries, then, cannot have direct control over whether\nthey act gratefully; and if we can only be obligated to do what is in\nour direct control, no beneficiary can be obligated to act gratefully.\nObligationists about gratitude might object that this argument targets\na straw man understanding of obligations of gratitude. Obligations of\ngratitude, if they exist, are not obligations to\n\u03c8-and-\u03c8-for-the-right-reasons, but simply obligations to\n\u03c8\u2014just as promissory obligations are simply obligations to\ndo as promised, not obligations to\ndo-as-promised-and-do-so-for-the-right-reasons. We might criticize a\npromisor if she does as promised for \u201cwrong\u201d reasons\n(e.g., reasons of self-interest); but we still believe that such\nobligations exist, and that one need not act for the right reason to\navoid breaching or violating them (though one may thereby fail to\nrespect, fulfill or discharge such obligations)\n(McConnell 1993; Owens 2012). So too, an obligationist might argue,\nwith gratitude.\n",
