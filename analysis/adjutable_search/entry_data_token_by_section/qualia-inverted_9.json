    "main_text": "Spectrum Inversion in an Argument\u2026 || \u2026Against Representationalism\n3.2 \u2026Against Representationalism\n\n\nIt is widely held that perceptual experiences represent the\nperceiver\u2019s environment as being a certain way. For example, the\nexperience of someone with normal color vision looking at figure 1\nrepresents (inter alia) her environment as containing a crimson,\nvermilion, and turquoise square. In the terminology of Chalmers 2004\n(slightly adapted), a representational property is a property\nof a mental state/event that specifies (perhaps only in part) the\nstate/event\u2019s representational content. For example, the property of\nbeing a visual experience that represents that there is a crimson\nsquare before one is a representational property (for a taxonomy of\nrepresentational properties, see Chalmers 2004, section 2). The basic\nidea of representationalism or intentionalism is that\nqualia are representational properties, or at least supervene on\nrepresentational properties. One advantage of representationalism is\nthat it appears to reduce \u201cphenomenal consciousness\u201d (Block\n1995) to a certain kind of intentionality. Since the problem of\nproviding a naturalistic account of intentionality is often thought to\nbe tractable, representationalism brings the possibility of a\nnaturalistic account of consciousness (see, e.g., Dretske 1995, Lycan\n1996, Tye 2000, and Speaks 2015).[36]\n\n\nSpectrum inversion scenarios help to focus the dispute between\nrepresentationalists and their critics. (Actual cases of shifted\nspectra can also serve: see Block 1999.) Any version of\nrepresentationalism is committed to the following thesis. Consider a\ncase of red-green spectrum inversion, and imagine Invert and Nonvert\nare both looking at the red peppers depicted in figure 6, against a\nneutral background. Nonvert\u2019s experience has\n\\(Q_{R}\\), while Invert\u2019s experience has\n\\(Q_{G}\\). Because the two experiences have\ndifferent qualia, any version of representationalism implies that, if\nthis scenario is possible, the two experiences differ in\nrepresentational content. Hence, if the foregoing scenario can be\nfilled out so that (a) the two experiences have the same\ncontent and (b) the scenario is possible, then representationalism is\nrefuted.\n\n\nHow can these two desiderata be satisfied? Fortunately for the\nanti-representationalist\u2014or phenomenist (Block \n2003)\u2014the usual ways of trying to secure (a) do not require Invert\nand Nonvert to be behavioral duplicates (or, for that matter,\nfunctional duplicates). The anti-representationalist can therefore\ndismiss concerns that a behaviorally undetectable inversion scenario is\nimpossible.\n\n\nThe description of the anti-representationalist scenario is\ntypically completed with the following three features. First, Invert is\nable to use her color vision to reidentify objects, distinguish objects\nfrom their backgrounds, etc., with more-or-less the facility of\nNonvert. In Locke\u2019s phrase, Invert \u201cwould be able as regularly to\ndistinguish Things for [her] Use by those Appearances\u201d. Second,\nInvert has been spectrally inverted from birth (or at least for a long\nperiod of time). Third, Nonvert and Invert belong to the same\nlinguistic community: in particular, they use color vocabulary in the\nsame way, applying \u2018red\u2019 to tomatoes, \u2018yellow\u2019\nto bananas, and so forth.\n\n\nAssume that this scenario is possible (for an argument that it isn\u2019t,\nsee Sundstr\u00f6m 2002 and Gibbons 2005; for a reply see Littlejohn\n2009). The three features just mentioned are intended to support the\nview that this scenario is one in which, when Invert and Nonvert both\nlook at the fruits depicted in figure 6, their experiences have\nthe same representational properties. In particular (glossing\nover a complication to be discussed in subsection 3.3 below), the\nbanana looks yellow to both Invert and Nonvert, the\nstrawberries look red to both, and so on. So, assuming that\nbananas are yellow, strawberries are red, etc., neither Invert nor\nNonvert is suffering from some global color illusion. If this inverted\nspectrum hypothesis is correct, then qualia do not supervene on\nrepresentational properties, and therefore representationalism is\nfalse.\n\n\n(Here is one way of putting the Inverted Earth version of this\nargument (see subsections 2.3.3 and 3.1). After first arriving on\nInverted Earth, your word \u2018red\u2019 means red, and to\nyou the green peppers on Inverted Earth look red. But after a period of\nacclimatization, you come to speak the language of the locals, and your\nexperiences come to represent correctly the colors of things\u2014green \npeppers on Inverted Earth look green. Now compare your present\nexperience of a green pepper on Inverted Earth with your previous\nexperience of peppers of exactly that shade back on Earth. Same\ncontent, but different qualia. Alternatively, the\nanti-representationalist argument can proceed by exhibiting an example\nof the converse: same qualia, but different content\u2014see Block\n1990, 64\u20137.)\n\n\nThe three features of the anti-representationalist scenario can\nmotivate the conclusion that Invert is not systematically misperceiving\nthe colors of things as follows. First, because Invert\u2019s color vision\nis as useful as Nonvert\u2019s for discriminating and identifying objects,\nsurely it would be arbitrary to suppose that Invert\u2019s color vision, but\nnot Nonvert\u2019s, is the source of pervasive illusions. Second, because\nNonvert has been inverted since birth, a complicated system of causal\nconnections between the colors of objects in her environment and states\nof her visual system has been in place for a long period. In\nparticular, there is a reliable causal connection between the presence\nof a red object before Invert\u2019s eyes and a certain neural event\noccurring in Invert; this sort of causal connection is plausibly\nsufficient to bestow the property of representing redness on this type\nof neural event. Third, because Invert and Nonvert belong to the same\nlinguistic community, Invert\u2019s word \u2018red\u2019 means\nred. So when Invert says (as she does), \u2018Strawberries\nlook red to me\u2019, she means that strawberries look red to\nher. So, if strawberries do not look red to her, Invert is\nsystematically in error about how things look, and this result is not\n credible.[37]\n\n\nNaturally, each of these reasons for thinking that Invert is not\nmisperceiving the colors of objects can be questioned. Against the\nfirst, one might dispute the claim that it would be arbitrary to\nconvict only Invert of error\u2014after all, for all that\u2019s been\nsaid, Nonvert and Invert might differ functionally, which is presumably\na relevant difference. Against the second, there are well-known\nproblems for the \u201ccausal covariational\u201d account of mental\ncontent that it assumes (see, e.g., Fodor 1992, Ch. 3). Finally,\nagainst the third, it may be argued that the consequence that Invert is\nmistaken about the content of her experience is not unacceptable (Tye\n2002,\n 451).[38]\n\n\nIt will be useful to set out the anti-representationalist argument\nmore carefully. Assume as a suppressed premise that the inverted\nspectrum scenario just described is possible, and suppose that Invert\nand Nonvert are both looking at a ripe tomato in good light:\n\nArgument B\n\nP1.\n\nNeither Invert nor Nonvert is misperceiving the color of the\ntomato.\nP2.\n\nThe tomato is red (and not any other color).\nHence:\n\nC1.\n\nThe tomato looks the same color (namely, red) to both Invert and\nNonvert.\nP3.\n\nIf representationalism is true, then the phenomenal difference\nbetween Invert and Nonvert is due to a difference in the colors that\ntheir experiences represent the tomato as having.\nHence, from C1 and P3:\n\nC2.\n\nRepresentationalism is false.\n\n\n\nSome of the dialectic surrounding P1 has been described. In the\nfollowing three subsections, other ways of resisting the argument will\nbe discussed.\n\n\nIf Argument B is sound, tomatoes look red to both Invert and\nNonvert, although the corresponding qualia are different. This is why\nspectrum inversion was not described in subsection 2.1 as a case where\ntomatoes look green to Invert (and look red to\nNonvert). If spectrum inversion is explained in these terms, the\nthought experiment is quite unsuitable for anti-representationalist\npurposes.\n\n\nAccording to the (orthodox) representationalist, an experience has\n\\(Q_{B}\\), say, just in case it is an experience\nthat represents blue. According to the phenomenist who endorses\nArgument B, an experience has \\(Q_{B}\\) just in\ncase it has a certain non-representational property. Let us\nstipulate that \u2018\\(B\\)\u2019 refers to this non-representational property,\nif such a thing exists. Then the two views may be put as follows:\n\nPhenomenism\n\\(Q_{B} = B\\) (a certain nonrepresentational\nproperty).\n\nOrthodox representationalism\n\\(Q_{B}\\) = property of visually representing\nblue (i.e., being an experience of something\u2019s looking blue).\n\n\nThe sense-datum theory is usually taken to be a form of phenomenism;\nit will be treated as such\n here.[39]\n According to the sense-datum theorist, sense-data that are associated\nwith experiences of seeing the sky, lapis lazuli, cobalt glass, etc.,\nhave a distinctive property; the traditional sense-datum theorist took\nthis property to be the color blue (see, e.g., Moore 1953, 30, n.2),\nbut let us speak more neutrally and call it \u2018blue\\('\\)\u2019\n(Peacocke 1983, Ch. 1). Then, according to the sense-datum theorist,\nthe phenomenist equation can be spelled out more informatively\nthus:\nSense-data theory\n\\(Q_{B} = B\\) = being a sensing of a\nblue\\('\\) sense-datum.\n\nOrthodox phenomenists (for instance Block and Levine) have\nno truck with sense-data, and typically leave the phenomenist equation\nunadorned. However, the sense-datum theorist can offer the following\nconsideration in her favor.\n\n\nImagine two experiences: first, an experience (call it\n\u2018\\(e_{1}\\)\u2019) of a blue triangle next to a red\nsquare; second, an experience \\((e_{2})\\) of\na red triangle next to a blue square. \\(e_{1}\\) has color\nqualia \\(Q_{B}\\) and\n\\(Q_{R}\\), and also \u201cspatial qualia\u201d,\nwhich we can label \u2018\\(Q_{Tr}\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(Q_{Sq}\\)\u2019. The reference of these\nfour bits of qualia terminology\n(\u2018\\(Q_{B}\\)\u2019,\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019,\n\u2018\\(Q_{Tr}\\)\u2019, and\n\u2018\\(Q_{Sq}\\)\u2019) has been fixed by, respectively,\nexperiences of blue objects, experiences of red objects, experiences of\ntriangles, and experiences of squares. \\(e_{2}\\), of\ncourse, also has \\(Q_{B},\nQ_{R}, Q_{Tr}\\), and\n\\(Q_{Sq}\\). Yet \\(e_{1}\\) and\n\\(e_{2}\\) differ phenomenologically, and therefore differ\nin qualia. So more qualia terminology is required: in particular, a\nquale name whose reference is fixed by experiences of blue triangles\nand red squares, and another name whose reference is fixed by\nexperiences of red triangles and blue squares. In a useful notation,\nthe first quale name is\n\u2018\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Sq(x) \\amp By \\amp Tr(y)}\\)\u2019,\n and the second is\n\u2018\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Tr(x) \\amp By \\amp Sq(y)}\\)\u2019.\n Obviously further qualia names with ever-more complicated subscripts will be\nneeded.\n\n\nNow notice that there are many entailment relations between\nqualia-statements\u2014for example, \u2018\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Sq(x)}\\)\u2019\nentails \u2018\\(e\\) has \\(Q_{Rx}\\)\u2019,\nand \u2018\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Tr(x) \\amp By \\amp Sq(y)}\\)\u2019\n entails \u2018\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Sq(y)}\\)\u2019,\nand so on. The orthodox representationalist and the sense-datum\ntheorist have simple accounts of these entailments in terms of the\nstructure of the objects of experiences (apparent\nstructure, for the representationalist; actual structure, for\nthe sense-datum theorist). Assuming representationalism:\n\u2018\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Sq(x)}\\)\u2019\n(equivalently, \u2018\\(e\\) is an experience of something\u2019s\nlooking red and square\u2019) clearly entails \u2018\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx}\\)\u2019 (equivalently, \u2018e is an\nexperience of something\u2019s looking red\u2019). Assuming the sense-datum\ntheory: \u2018\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Sq(x)}\\)\u2019\n(equivalently, \u2018\\(e\\) is a sensing of a red and square\nsense-datum\u2019) clearly entails \u2018\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx}\\)\u2019 (equivalently,\n\u2018\\(e\\) is a sensing of a red sense-datum\u2019). The\northodox phenomenist cannot give a similar explanation of these\nentailments, and it is not clear whether she is entitled to them at\n all.[40]\n",
