    "main_text": "Introduction || Deduction and Formalization\n1.2 Deduction and Formalization\n\nThis is not the place for a detailed analysis of deduction. For\npresent purposes, this notion will be presumed to be fairly\nstraightforward, at least in principle. A deduction is any sequence of\nstatements each of which is derived from some initial set of\nstatements (the premises) or from a prior statement in the sequence.\nHowever, one issue that does need to be addressed is the relationship\nbetween deduction and formalization (see, e.g., Azzouni 2013).\n\nAn argument may be deductive without being formal. Although the\nparadigm cases of deduction do tend to occur in highly formalized\nsystems, this is not necessary. \u201cAll even numbers greater than 2\nare composite; 1058 is greater than 2; 1058 is even; hence 1058 is\ncomposite\u201d is a perfectly good deduction, despite not being\nformalized. Hence, contrary to what is sometimes assumed in\ndiscussions of these issues, it is not true that all informal aspects\nof mathematical practice are thereby non-deductive.\n\nOn the other hand, the development of formal logic has been closely\nbound up with providing a clear language for presenting (and\nevaluating) deductive mathematical reasoning. Indeed, as John Burgess\nargues in his (1992), modern classical logic largely developed as a\nbasis for mathematical reasoning, especially proof. The increase in\nrigor within mathematics during the 19th Century is\nproperly viewed as a cause, not an effect, of the logical revolution\nset off by Frege\u2019s work. Logic, in Burgess\u2019s view, is\ndescriptive: its goal is to construct mathematical models of\nreasoning. Classical logic constitutes an idealized description of\nclassical mathematical proof.\n\nIt may also be important to distinguish informal elements of\na given mathematical proof from unformalizable elements (if\nthere are any such\n things).[3]\n In Section 4, this issue will be taken up in connection with the use\nof diagrams in mathematical reasoning.\n",
