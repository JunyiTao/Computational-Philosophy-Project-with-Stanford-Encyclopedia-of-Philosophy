    "main_text": "Collective Self-Deception\n7. Collective Self-Deception\n\nCollective self-deception has received scant direct philosophical\nattention as compared with its individual counterpart. Collective\nself-deception might refer simply to a group of similarly\nself-deceived individuals or to a group-entity (such as a corporation,\ncommittee, jury, or the like) that is self-deceived. These\nalternatives reflect two basic perspectives that social\nepistemologists have taken on ascriptions of propositional attitudes\nto collectives. On the one hand, such attributions might be taken\nsummatively as simply an indirect way of attributing those\nstates to members of the collective (Quinton 1975/1976). This\nsummative understanding, then, considers attitudes attributed to\ngroups to be nothing more than metaphors expressing the sum of the\nattitudes held by their members. To say that students think tuition is\ntoo high is just a way of saying that most students think so. On the\nother hand, such attributions might be understood\nnon-summatively as applying to collective entities,\nthemselves ontologically distinct from the members upon which they\ndepend. These so-called \u2018plural subjects\u2019 (Gilbert 1989,\n1994, 2005) or \u2018social integrates\u2019 (Pettit 2003), while\nsupervening upon the individuals comprising them, may well express\nattitudes that diverge from individual members. For instance, saying\nNASA believed the O-rings on the space shuttle\u2019s booster rockets\nto be safe need not imply that most or all the members of this\norganization personally held this belief, only that the institution\nitself did. The non-summative understanding, then, considers\ncollectives to be, like persons, apt targets for attributions of\npropositional attitudes and potentially of moral and epistemic censure\nas well. Following this distinction, collective self-deception may be\nunderstood in either a summative or non-summative sense.\n\nIn the summative sense, collective self-deception refers to a\nself-deceptive belief shared by a group of individuals whom each come\nto hold the self-deceptive belief for similar reasons and by similar\nmeans, varying according to the account of self-deception followed. We\nmight call this self-deception across a collective. In the\nnon-summative sense, the subject of collective self-deception is the\ncollective itself, not simply the individuals comprising it. The\nfollowing sections offer an overview of these forms of collective\nself-deception, noting the significant challenges posed by each.\n",
