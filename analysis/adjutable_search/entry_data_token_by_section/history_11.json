    "main_text": "Anglo-American philosophy of history || Historical objectivity\n3.2 Historical objectivity\n\nAnother issue that provoked significant attention among analytic\nphilosophers of history is the issue of \u201cobjectivity.\u201d Is\nit possible for historical knowledge to objectively represent the\npast? Or are forms of bias, omission, selection, and interpretation\nsuch as to make all historical representations dependent on the\nperspective of the individual historian? Does the fact that human\nactions are value-laden make it impossible for the historian to\nprovide a non-value-laden account of those actions?\n\nThis topic divides into several different problems, as noted by John\nPassmore (1966: 76). The most studied of these within the analytic\ntradition is that of the value-ladenness of social action. Second is\nthe possibility that the historian\u2019s interpretations are\nthemselves value-laden\u2014raising the question of the capacity for\nobjectivity or neutrality of the historian herself. Does the\nintellectual have the ability to investigate the world without regard\nto the biases that are built into her political or ethical beliefs,\nher ideology, or her commitments to a class or a social group? And\nthird is the question of the objectivity of the historical\ncircumstances themselves. Is there a fixed historical reality,\nindependent from later representations of the facts? Or is history\nintrinsically \u201cconstructed,\u201d with no objective reality\nindependent from the ways in which it is constructed? Is there a\nreality corresponding to the phrase, \u201cthe French\nRevolution,\u201d or is there simply an accumulation of written\nversions of the French Revolution?\n\nThere are solutions to each of these problems that are highly\nconsonant with the philosophical assumptions of the analytic\ntradition. First, concerning values: There is no fundamental\ndifficulty in reconciling the idea of a researcher with one set of\nreligious values, who nonetheless carefully traces out the religious\nvalues of a historical actor possessing radically different values.\nThis research can be done badly, of course; but there is no inherent\nepistemic barrier that makes it impossible for the researcher to\nexamine the body of statements, behaviors, and contemporary cultural\ninstitutions corresponding to the other, and to come to a justified\nrepresentation of the other. One need not share the values or\nworldview of a sans-culotte, in order to arrive at a\njustified appraisal of those values and worldview. This leads us to a\nresolution of the second issue as well\u2014the possibility of\nneutrality on the part of the researcher. The set of epistemic values\nthat we impart to scientists and historians include the value of\nintellectual discipline and a willingness to subject their hypotheses\nto the test of uncomfortable facts. Once again, review of the history\nof science and historical writing makes it apparent that this\nintellectual value has effect. There are plentiful examples of\nscientists and historians whose conclusions are guided by their\ninterrogation of the evidence rather than their ideological\npresuppositions. Objectivity in pursuit of truth is itself a value,\nand one that can be followed.\n\nFinally, on the question of the objectivity of the past: Is there a\nbasis for saying that events or circumstances in the past have\nobjective, fixed characteristics that are independent from our\nrepresentation of those events? Is there a representation-independent\nreality underlying the large historical structures to which historians\ncommonly refer (the Roman Empire, the Great Wall of China, the\nimperial administration of the Qianlong Emperor)? We can work our way\ncarefully through this issue, by recognizing a distinction between the\nobjectivity of past events, actions and circumstances, the objectivity\nof the contemporary facts that resulted from these past events, and\nthe objectivity and fixity of large historical entities. The past\noccurred in precisely the way that it did\u2014agents acted, droughts\noccurred, armies were defeated, new technologies were invented. These\noccurrences left traces of varying degrees of information richness;\nand these traces give us a rational basis for arriving at beliefs\nabout the occurrences of the past. So we can offer a non-controversial\ninterpretation of the \u201cobjectivity of the past.\u201d However,\nthis objectivity of events and occurrences does not extend very far\nupward as we consider more abstract historical events: the creation of\nthe Greek city-state, the invention of Enlightenment rationality, the\nTaiping Rebellion. In each of these instances the noun\u2019s\nreferent is an interpretive construction by historical actors and\nhistorians, and one that may be undone by future historians. To refer\nto the \u201cTaiping Rebellion\u201d requires an act of synthesis of\na large number of historical facts, along with an interpretive story\nthat draws these facts together in this way rather than that way. The\nunderlying facts of behavior, and their historical traces, remain; but\nthe knitting-together of these facts into a large historical event\ndoes not constitute an objective historical entity. Consider research\nin the past twenty years that questions the existence of the\n\u201cIndustrial Revolution.\u201d In this debate, the same set of\nhistorical facts were first constructed into an abrupt episode of\nqualitative change in technology and output in Western Europe; under\nthe more recent interpretation, these changes were more gradual and\nless correctly characterized as a \u201crevolution\u201d\n(O\u2019Brien and Keyder 1978). Or consider Arthur Waldron\u2019s\nsustained and detailed argument to the effect that there was no\n\u201cGreat Wall of China,\u201d as that structure is usually\nconceptualized (1990).\n",
