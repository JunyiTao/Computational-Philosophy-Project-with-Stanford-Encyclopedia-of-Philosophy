    "main_text": "The Cross-Cultural Legacy of the Kyoto School || Between and Beyond East and West\n5.2 Japanese Philosophy in the World\n\nIt is not, therefore, necessarily ethnocentric for Japanese thinkers\nto suggest the potential efficacy of introducing into a global\nphilosophical dialogue ideas that derive from Japanese, East Asian, or\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist traditions. The \u201cJapanese\nphilosophy\u201d of the Kyoto School is best understood as a\ncontribution to such an intercultural conversation, and not merely as\na reactive opposition to philosophical Eurocentrism or indeed\n\u201cphilosophical Euromonopolism.\u201d In any case, we must be\ncareful in how we understand the noun \u201cphilosophy\u201d and the\nmodifier \u201cJapanese\u201d when we speak of \u201cJapanese\nphilosophy\u201d (see Davis 2020b).\n\nAlthough the question of whether \u201cphilosophy\u201d existed in\nnon-Western traditions is today being intensely debated, with more and\nmore scholars referring not only to \u201cIndian philosophy\u201d\nand \u201cChinese philosophy\u201d but also to \u201cAfrican\nphilosophy\u201d and \u201cIndigenous philosophy,\u201d the Kyoto\nSchool philosophers themselves never doubted that\n\u201cphilosophy,\u201d in the literal and historically specific\nsense, is originally a cultural product of the Western tradition. But\nthey also recognize that it, like Western science and technology, has\nuniversal implications that can be developed by peoples around the\nglobe. This does not mean that they think Western philosophy is free\nof unrecognized cultural biases and limitations, or that traditional\nAsian traditions have nothing essential to offer the development of\nphilosophy in a post-Eurocentric world. They recognize the difference\nbetween the global potentialities and the still parochial actualities\nof philosophy, and their Japanese contributions aim to make philosophy\nmore, not less, worldly.\n\nIn an illuminating study of the debates surrounding the concept of\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d in Japan since the Meiji period\n(1868\u20131912), John Maraldo has isolated four senses in which the\nnotion of \u201cJapanese philosophy\u201d has been used: (1) Western\nphilosophy as it happens to be practiced by Japanese scholars; (2)\ntraditional Japanese thought (Confucian, Nativist, Buddhist, etc.) as\nit was formulated prior to the introduction of Western philosophy; (3)\na form of inquiry which has methods and themes that are Western in\norigin, but that can be applied to pre-modern, pre-Westernized,\nJapanese thinking; and (4) a kind of reverse Orientalism that asserts\nthe superiority of specifically Japanese ways of thinking.\n\nMaraldo argues for the superior viability of the third of these\nconceptions, in part because it pays due hermeneutical attention to\nthe Greek origins of the heretofore prevailing methods and themes of\n\u201cphilosophy.\u201d And yet, crucially, he also stresses that\nthe very methods and themes of philosophy are essentially always\n\u201cin the making,\u201d and that the production of\n\u201cJapanese philosophy\u201d will have to \u201cstrike a balance\nbetween reading (pre-defined) philosophy into [Japan\u2019s\ntraditional] texts and reading alternatives out of them, constructing\ncontrasts to that [pre-defined] philosophy [of the West]\u201d\n(Maraldo 2004, 238\u201344). The Kyoto School in particular can be\nunderstood to have taken up the challenge of critically and creatively\nappropriating philosophy so as to free up for questioning many of its\npre-defined Western conceptions.\n\nA text by Ueda on Nishitani\u2019s philosophy insightfully addresses\nthe question of the adjective \u201cJapanese\u201d as follows:\n\u201cIf we are to use the characterization \u2018Japanese\u2019,\nthis does not signify merely a particularity of Japan, but rather must\nbe understood in the sense that a certain area of universal primal\nhuman possibility has been historically realized particularly in\nJapan. Hence, \u2018European\u2019 does not straightaway mean\n\u2018global\u2019, but rather that a certain area of universal\nprimal human possibility has been historically realized particularly\nin Europe. \u2026 If we understand ourselves as the\nparticularization of something universal, this means, at the same\ntime, that we can understand others as different particularizations of\nsomething universal. Only then, with the communication between\nparticular and particular, can something universal come to be\nrealized\u201d (Ueda 1996, 309).\n\nIn this passage, which recalls Nishida\u2019s vision of communication\nbetween diversely determined branches of a shared yet essentially\nindeterminate root ur-culture, Ueda gives us a clue as to how we might\nbest understand the cross-cultural contributions of the Kyoto School.\nThey are philosophers who strive to express something universal from a\nparticular standpoint. But this does not at all mean that they attempt\nto reduce universality to their own particularity; for the latter is\nin turn understood as one particular expression of the formless\nur-culture, the indeterminate source of possibilities for individual\nand cultural determination, that is to say, the originary nothingness\nthat we all share. The Kyoto School thus presents us with a unique set\nof attempts to give philosophical form to this formless wellspring of\nboth commonality and singularity.\n\nThe degree to which the Kyoto School thinkers were successful in their\nboldly paradoxical quest to give philosophical form to the formless\ncan be debated. It is less easy to deny the exigency of the quest\nitself. If philosophy today is to mature beyond its Eurocentric and\neven \u201cEuromonopolistic\u201d pubescence (see Davis 2020b,\n28\u201333), then it is necessary to deepen its quest for\nuniversality by way of radically opening it up to a diversity of\ncultural perspectives. If cultural pluralism, for its part, is to\navoid falling into a relativistic antagonism or isolationism, it must\nentail a metamorphosis rather than an abandonment of the philosophical\nquest for universality (see Fujita 2013; Maraldo 2013). In any case,\nwe should understand the thought of the Kyoto School, not as a set of\nexclusively Japanese versions of philosophy, but rather as a set of\nJapanese contributions to the content of\u2014and indeed to the very\nformation of the forum of\u2014a global dialogue of \u201cworld\nphilosophy\u201d in the making.\n",
