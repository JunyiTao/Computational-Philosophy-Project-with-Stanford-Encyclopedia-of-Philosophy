Brouwer\u2019s\nassistant Hurewicz discussed the incompleteness theorem in a seminar\n(van Dalen 2005: 674n.7). There is no comment from Brouwer on\nG\u00f6del\u2019s first theorem in print; on the other hand, he\nclearly had the second theorem in mind when he wrote, in 1952,\nthat\n\n\nThe hope originally fostered by the Old Formalists that mathematical\nscience erected according to their principles would be crowned one day\nwith a proof of non-contradictority, was never fulfilled, and,\nnowadays, in view of the results of certain investigations of the last\nfew decades, has, I think, been relinquished. (Brouwer 1952B: 508)\n\n\nHao Wang reports:\n\n\nIn the spring of 1961 I visited Brouwer at his home. He discoursed\nwidely on many subjects. Among other things he said that he did not\nthink G\u2019s incompleteness results are as important as\nHeyting\u2019s formalization of intuitionistic reasoning, because to\nhim G\u2019s results are obvious (obviously true). (Wang 1987:\n 88)[13]\n\n\nWith respect to the first incompleteness theorem, Brouwer\u2019s\nreaction is readily understandable. Already in his dissertation, he\nhad noted that the totality of all possible mathematical constructions\nis \u201cdenumerably unfinished\u201d; by this he meant that\n\n\nwe can never construct in a well-defined way more than a denumerable\nsubset of it, but when we have constructed such a subset, we can\nimmediately deduce from it, following some previously defined\nmathematical process, new elements which are counted to the original\nset. (Brouwer 1907: 148 [1975: 82])\n\n\nAnd in one of the notebooks leading up to his dissertation, he stated\nthat \u201cThe totality of mathematical theorems is, among other\nthings, also a set which is denumerable but never\n finished\u201d.[14]\n\nIndeed, according to Carnap, it had been an argument of\nBrouwer\u2019s that had stimulated G\u00f6del in finding the first\ntheorem. In a diary note for December 12, 1929, Carnap states that\nG\u00f6del talked to him that day\n\n\nabout the inexhaustibility of mathematics (see separate sheet). He was\nstimulated to this idea by Brouwer\u2019s Vienna lecture. Mathematics\nis not completely formalizable. He appears to be right. (Wang 1987:\n84)\n\n\nOn the \u201cseparate sheet\u201d, Carnap wrote down what G\u00f6del\nhad told him:\n\n\nWe admit as legitimate mathematics certain reflections on the grammar\nof a language that concerns the empirical. If one seeks to formalize\nsuch a mathematics, then with each formalization there are problems,\nwhich one can understand and express in ordinary language, but cannot\nexpress in the given formalized language. It follows (Brouwer) that\nmathematics is inexhaustible: one must always again draw afresh from\nthe \u201cfountain of intuition\u201d. There is, therefore, no\ncharacteristica universalis for the whole mathematics, and no\ndecision procedure for the whole mathematics. In each and every\nclosed language there are only countably many expressions.\nThe continuum appears only in \u201cthe whole of\nmathematics\u201d \u2026 If we have only one language, and\ncan only make \u201celucidations\u201d about it, then these\nelucidations are inexhaustible, they always require some new intuition\nagain. (As quoted, in translation, in Wang 1987: 50)\n\n\nThis record contains in particular elements from the second of\nBrouwer\u2019s two lectures in Vienna, in which one finds the\nargument that G\u00f6del refers to: on the one hand, the full\ncontinuum is given in a priori intuition, while on the other hand, it\ncannot be exhausted by a language with countably many expressions\n(Brouwer 1930A: 3, 6 [Mancosu 1998: 56, 58]).\n\nThe second incompleteness theorem, on the other hand, must have\nsurprised Brouwer, given his optimism in the 1920s about the formalist\nschool achieving its aim of proving the consistency of formalized\nclassical mathematics (see the quotation at the beginning of this\nsubsection).\n\nIn his final original published paper (1955), Brouwer was, in his own\nway, quite positive about the study of classical logic. After showing\nthat various principles from the algebraic tradition in logic (e.g.,\nBoole, Schr\u00f6der) are intuitionistically contradictory, he\ncontinues:\n\n\nFortunately classical algebra of logic has its merits quite apart from\nthe question of its applicability to mathematics. Not only as a formal\nimage of the technique of common-sensical thinking has it reached a\nhigh degree of perfection, but also in itself, as an edifice of\nthought, it is a thing of exceptional harmony and beauty. Indeed, its\nsuccessor, the sumptuous symbolic logic of the twentieth century which\nat present is continually raising the most captivating problems and\nmaking the most surprising and penetrating discoveries, likewise is\nfor a great part cultivated for its own sake.
