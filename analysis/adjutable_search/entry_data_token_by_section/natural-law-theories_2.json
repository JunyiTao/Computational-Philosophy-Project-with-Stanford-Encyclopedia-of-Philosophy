    "main_text": "Enabling positivity: social facts made reasons for action || Political authority as remedy for anarchy, injustice and impoverishment\n1.2 Political authority as remedy for anarchy, injustice and impoverishment\n\n\nThe texts that are earliest (e.g., the Platonic or pseudo-Platonic\nMinos: Lewis 2006) and most foundational (e.g., Plato\u2019s\nGorgias, Republic and Laws, and Aristotle\u2019s\nPolitics) in the tradition of natural law theory remind their\nreaders of the evident evils of anarchy: a condition of things in\nwhich no person or body of persons efficaciously claims or is accepted\nwidely as having authority to restrict the use of violence, theft and\nfraud, and in which any conventional norms of conduct are made hollow\nby irresolvable disputes about their content and/or their\napplication. In such a state of affairs, the more strong, cunning and\nruthless prey on the less, education of children (which calls for\nresources outside the family) is difficult to accomplish, and economic\nactivity remains stunted by the insecurity of holdings and the\nunreliability of undertakings. There is evident need for persons who\nwill articulate and enforce standards of conduct which will tend to\npromote the common good of bodily security, stable access to\nresources, cooperation in economic and educational activities, and\nrectification (by punishment, compensation and restitution) of at\nleast the grosser inter-personal injuries of commission and\nneglect. To articulate that need is to state the reasons for\ninstituting and supporting political authority, notably state\ngovernment and law, on condition that these institutions carry on\ntheir legislative, executive and judicial activities substantially for\nthe common good of the inhabitants of the relevant territory, rather\nthan in the interests of a segment of the population unfairly\nindifferent or hostile to the interests and wellbeing of other\nsegments.\n",
