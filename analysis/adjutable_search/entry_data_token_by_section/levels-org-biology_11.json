Here the\nfocus is on the emergence of new levels of organization\nthrough evolutionary processes (Buss 1987: ch. 5; Griesemer 2001;\nMaynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry 1995; Okasha 2006). The background\nidea is that the complex hierarchical organization of nature that we\nobserve today must itself be a result of evolution, and therefore\nrequires an evolutionary explanation. For example, somehow prokaryotes\nevolved to eukaryotic cells, single-celled organisms evolved to\nmulticellular organisms, individual animals evolved to colonies, and\nso on (see also\n section 6.5).\n In their highly influential book, Maynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry\n(1995) proposed that the characteristic feature of major evolutionary\ntransitions is that entities that were capable of replicating\nindependently before the transitions are only capable of replicating\nas parts of higher-level wholes after the transitions (see also Buss\n1987). For example, after a single-celled organism has evolved into a\nmulticellular organism, the cells of the organism can no longer\nreplicate independently of the organism as a whole.\n\nDetailed models of these processes of evolutionary transitions have\nbeen developed, such as the evolutionary transitions of individuality\n(ETI) account of Michod (1999; 2005). The basic idea of this model is\nthat evolutionary transitions involve a decline in the fitness of\nindividuals (e.g., cells as they engage in cooperative behavior) and a\ncorresponding increase in the fitness of the collectives that they\nform (e.g., multicellular organisms). This eventually results in\nfitness being completely transferred to the collectives, which thereby\nform a new level of organization (see also Bourrat 2015 for criticism\nand discussion).\n",
