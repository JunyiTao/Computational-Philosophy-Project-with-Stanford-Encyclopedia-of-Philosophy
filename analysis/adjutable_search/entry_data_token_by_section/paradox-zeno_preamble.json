    "main_text": "\n\nAlmost everything that we know about Zeno of Elea is to be found in\nthe opening pages of Plato\u2019s Parmenides. There we learn\nthat Zeno was nearly 40 years old when Socrates was a young man, say\n20. Since Socrates was born in 469 BC we can estimate a birth date for\nZeno around 490 BC. Beyond this, really all we know is that he was\nclose to Parmenides (Plato reports the gossip that they were lovers\nwhen Zeno was young), and that he wrote a book of paradoxes defending\nParmenides\u2019 philosophy. Sadly this book has not survived, and\nwhat we know of his arguments is second-hand, principally through\nAristotle and his commentators (here we draw particularly on\nSimplicius, who, though writing a thousand years after Zeno,\napparently possessed at least some of his book). There were apparently\n40 \u2018paradoxes of plurality\u2019, attempting to show that\nontological pluralism\u2014a belief in the existence of many things\nrather than only one\u2014leads to absurd conclusions; of these\nparadoxes only two definitely survive, though a third argument can\nprobably be attributed to Zeno. Aristotle speaks of a further four\narguments against motion (and by extension change generally), all of\nwhich he gives and attempts to refute. In addition Aristotle\nattributes two other paradoxes to Zeno. Sadly again, almost none of\nthese paradoxes are quoted in Zeno\u2019s original words by their\nvarious commentators, but in paraphrase. \n",
