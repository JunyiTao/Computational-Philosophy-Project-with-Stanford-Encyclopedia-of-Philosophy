This pattern affects, for example, which molecule\nencounters another. When analyzing such soups, however, chemists do\nnot try to decipher the arrangement but instead rely on statistical\nmeasures about the likelihood of encounters. But cells are\ndifferent\u2014different molecules are segregated in different\nlocations and how they are organized affects the resulting behavior\n(this is true even in prokaryotic cells that lack internal membranes,\nwith molecules segregated in different parts of the cell, sometimes\nchanging location over the course of a day; see Cohen, Erb,\nSelimkhanov, et al., 2014). Organization is also important in\nmanufactured products. If the parts of your computer were distributed\non your desk, and each part was provided with some input so that it\nwas performing an operation, the parts would still not carry out the\nsame activities as they do when they are in their proper arrangement.\nOrganization ensures that the outputs of one component are passed to\nthe appropriate others as inputs. The importance of organization is\nfurther recognized when one considers that what human designers do is\nimpose new organization on existing components to achieve novel\ndesired effects. Evolution often does the same in biology.\n\nOrganization is especially important for attempts to understand the\nactivities of cells but, until recently, cell biologists have had\nlimited tools for determining organization. At a coarse-grained level,\nthe combination of cell fractionation and electron microscopy provided\ninformation about organization and this provided insight into how\ncells perform their activities. For example, recognizing that enzymes\nthat can break apart cell components are segregated from the rest of\nthe cell within the lysosome explains why they only carry out their\nactivities on structures that are first transported into the lysosome.\nAnd knowing that a collection of enzymes is localized in an adjacent\nmembrane explains how products of one reaction are readily taken up in\nanother. In these cases the organization realized in cells and its\nconsequences can be characterized qualitatively and presented in a\nmechanism diagram, as discussed in\n section 4.3.\n In other cases, however, the organization is more complex than can be\ndescribed in such qualitative terms. Especially when components are\norganized into feedback loops, and the individual operations are\ncharacterized in nonlinear functions, cell biologists turn to\ncomputational models to understand their behavior. Bechtel and\nAbrahamsen (2010) and Brigandt (2013) describe a number of examples\nfrom recent research on cell phenomena that require computational\nmodels and refer to the resulting explanations that apply dynamical\nanalysis to mechanistic accounts as \u201cdynamical mechanistic\nexplanations\u201d. Using computational modeling of spindle formation\nin cell division as an example, Gross (2018) shows how computational\nmodels can go beyond what has been established experimentally and\nserve as heuristics guiding further research.\n\nIn recent years cell biologists have acquired new tools for studying\norganization, many of these advanced in systems biology (Green 2017;\nsee the entry on\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology).\n One approach in systems biology seeks to develop comprehensive\ndetailed models of the numerous components identified as involved in\nspecific phenomena (Gross & Green 2017). High-throughput data\nabout, for example, which proteins in a cell can bind to each other or\nwhich pairs of genes, when mutated together, are lethal, has massively\nincreased the number of cell components associated with any given\nphenomenon. To make sense of this cell researchers often seek abstract\nmodels by constructing networks in which nodes stand for entities and\nedges for interactions between entities (Green et al. 2018). The\nchallenge researchers face is to make sense of these\nnetworks\u2014given the large number of entities involved and their\nmany interactions, these networks can often appear as hairballs. We\nbriefly consider two strategies for analyzing networks in cell biology\nthat philosophers have analyzed.\n\nAlon and his collaborators, focusing on gene transcription networks and metabolic\nnetworks in bacteria and yeast, identified \u201crecurring,\nsignificant patterns of interconnections\u201d involving two, three, or four\nnodes, which they called motifs (Milo et al., 2002: 824). One example, occurring in\n\u201chundreds of non-homologous gene systems\u201d (Mangan,\nZaslaver, & Alon 2003: 197) in the transcription network of E.\ncoli, is the feedforward loop. In a feedforward loop\n (Figure 6),\n one unit sends inputs to two other units, the first of which also\nsends an input to the other, which serves as the final output unit.\nUsing Boolean models, Alon and his colleagues demonstrated that\ndepending on whether the connections are excitatory or inhibitory,\nsuch a motif can perform a number of different functions. For example,\nif all the connections are excitatory and the final output unit is\nonly active when it receives input from both of the other units (the\nconnections to it constitute an AND-gate, as shown on the left in\n Figure 6),\n then the feedforward loop functions as a persistence\ndetector\u2014the output unit only becomes active when the input to\nthe first unit endures at least until the second unit becomes active.\nThis, as Mangan et al. explain, protects the output (which might serve\nto start the transcription of a gene) from being generated in response\nto random noise presented to the input unit. The feedforward loop and\nAlon\u2019s other motifs are characterized abstractly without\nspecific reference to what entities and interactions correspond to the\nnodes and edges. Philosophers who have examined this research refer to\nthese organizational patterns as design principles (Green\n2015; Green, Levy, & Bechtel 2015; Levy & Bechtel 2013).\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Three examples of feedforward\nloops studied by Alon and his colleagues\n\n\nThe second strategy employs computational tools such as cluster\nanalysis to find collections of nodes that are especially highly\ninterconnected. To interpret these clusters in terms of mechanisms\noperative in the cell, researchers often align them with Gene Ontology\n(GO), a resource that was developed to represent published information\nabout cell components, molecular functions, and biological processes\nin directed acyclic graphs so as to facilitate communication between\nresearchers working on different species (Ashburner et al. 2000).\nLeonelli (2016) examines many of the epistemic issues the developers\nof GO confronted in developing such a resource. Beyond its original\nfunction, GO is now widely used to interpret network graphs\nmechanistically. By annotating nodes in cellular networks with\ninformation from GO when it is available researchers interpret these\nclusters as corresponding to known mechanisms or sometimes as\nconstituting previously unknown mechanisms. Researchers make\ninferences about nodes for which such information is lacking using\nprinciples such as guilt by association\u2014the entity is\ninferred to occur in the same location or to contribute to the same\nprocess as those with which it clusters (Bechtel 2017 analyzes several examples).\n\nAs a result of computational models and analyses of large networks,\ncell biology in the twenty-first century is much more focused on\norganization and appears much less reductionistic than it did in the\nmid twentieth century. For some philosophers, this reliance on network\nanalyses represents a move away from mechanistic explanations towards\na process view (Th\u00e9ry 2015; Nicholson 2018; Dupr\u00e9 2012).\nHuneman (2010, 2018) construes the explanations resulting from network\nanalysis as a distinct type of explanation he labels topological\nexplanation. Others, however, argue that since these analyses\nstill draw upon the components constituting the system and the\nbiologists developing them continue to think of them as mechanistic,\nwe should extend the conception of mechanistic explanation to include\nthe holistic focus on organization developed in computational and\nnetwork analyses (Baetu 2015; Bechtel 2015; Levy 2014).\n",
