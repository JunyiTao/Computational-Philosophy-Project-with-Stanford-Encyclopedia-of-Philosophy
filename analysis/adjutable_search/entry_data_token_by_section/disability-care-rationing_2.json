A fragile truce has been reached in\nwhich it is admitted that we cannot accept either a purely utilitarian\nCEA approach unalloyed with considerations of fairness, or a purely\negalitarian lottery approach unaffected by intuitions concerning the\nsignificance of ineffective use of valuable resources. In part this is\nbecause of an intractable dilemma that dominates the rationing debate,\nwhich we will describe more specifically for the case of disability in\nthe next section. We seem to be stuck between two extremes: allocate\nin terms of a \u201cneutral\u201d consideration such as \u201cfirst\ncome first serve\u201d or pure lottery, or open the door to an\nunlimited number of potentially ethically relevant considerations\nthat, together, make the allocation decision overwhelming difficult\nand cumbersome. The first option seems irrational, the second\nimpractical.\n\nAnother reason for the stalemate is the aggregation problem as applied\nto the \u201cbenefit\u201d side of the CEA calculation. Some have\nargued that we should abandon the QALY and DALY, summary health\nmeasure technology entirely (Anand & Wailoo 2000), while most\nagree with Dan Brock that health care prioritization without any\nreference to quality of life is a non-starter (Brock 1995). There have\nbeen some attempts at finding a workable multi-criteria approach in\nwhich health benefits are disaggregated into separate components\n(Baltussen & Niessen 2006), but such suggestions open the door to\nthe so-called \u201cindexing problem\u201d (discussed later in the\ncontext of disability) of trying to sum up disparate and\nincommensurable benefits (income, happiness, social productivity,\ncreativity) in a way that would allow us to compare two health\noutcomes. Attempts at direct head-to-head comparisons between health\noutcomes require the dubious methodological assumption that health is\nunidimensional: walking out of the hospital with one\nsurviving hand is obviously better than with none; but is being left\npartially sighted better, or worse, than ending up in a wheelchair?\nHow do we compare various domains of human functioning that, together,\nmake up the state of health?\n\nThis then is the general ethical backdrop against which the special\nmoral concern about the impact of disability on health resource\nprioritization must be placed. We begin with why it is that\ndisability\u2014of the myriad of differences between people that\nmight matter in how we decide to allocate health care\nresources\u2014is different.\n",
