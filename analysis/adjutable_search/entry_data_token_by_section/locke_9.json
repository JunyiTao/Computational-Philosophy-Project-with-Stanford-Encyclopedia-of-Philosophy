    "main_text": "The Limits of Human Understanding || Knowledge and Probability\n2.5 Knowledge and Probability\n\nKnowledge involves the seeing of the agreement or disagreement of our\nideas. What then is probability and how does it relate to knowledge?\nLocke writes:\n\n\nThe Understanding Faculties being given to Man, not barely for\nSpeculation, but also for the Conduct of his Life, Man would be at a\ngreat loss, if he had nothing to direct him, but what has the\nCertainty of true Knowledge\u2026 Therefore, as God has set\nsome Things in broad day-light; as he has given us some certain\nKnowledge\u2026So in the greater part of our Concernment, he has\nafforded us only the twilight, as I may say so, of Probability,\nsuitable, I presume, to that State of Mediocrity and Probationership,\nhe has been pleased to place us in here, wherein to check our\nover-confidence and presumption, we might by every day\u2019s\nExperience be made sensible of our short sightedness and liableness to\nError\u2026 (IV.14.1\u20132, N: 652)\n\n\nSo, apart from the few important things that we can know for certain,\ne.g. the existence of ourselves and God, the nature of mathematics and\nmorality broadly construed, for the most part we must lead our lives\nwithout knowledge. What then is probability? Locke writes:\n\n\nAs Demonstration is the shewing of the agreement or disagreement of\ntwo Ideas, by the intervention of one or more Proofs, which have a\nconstant, immutable, and visible connexion one with another: so\nProbability is nothing but the appearance of such an Agreement or\nDisagreement, by the intervention of Proofs, whose connection is not\nconstant and immutable, or at least is not perceived to be so, but is\nor appears, for the most part to be so, and is enough to induce the\nMind to judge the Proposition to be true, or false, rather than the\ncontrary. (IV.15.1, N: 654)\n\n\nProbable reasoning, on this account, is an argument, similar in\ncertain ways to the demonstrative reasoning that produces knowledge\nbut different also in certain crucial respects. It is an argument that\nprovides evidence that leads the mind to judge a proposition true or\nfalse but without a guarantee that the judgment is correct. This kind\nof probable judgment comes in degrees, ranging from near\ndemonstrations and certainty to unlikeliness and improbability in the\nvicinity of impossibility. It is correlated with degrees of assent\nranging from full assurance down to conjecture, doubt and\ndistrust.\n\nThe new science of mathematical probability had come into being on the\ncontinent just around the time that Locke was writing the\nEssay. His account of probability, however, shows little or\nno awareness of mathematical probability. Rather it reflects an older\ntradition that treated testimony as probable reasoning. Given that\nLocke\u2019s aim, above all, is to discuss what degree of assent we\nshould give to various religious propositions, the older conception of\nprobability very likely serves his purposes best. Thus, when Locke\ncomes to describe the grounds for probability he cites the conformity\nof the proposition to our knowledge, observation and experience, and\nthe testimony of others who are reporting their observation and\nexperience. Concerning the latter we must consider the number of\nwitnesses, their integrity, their skill in observation, counter\ntestimony and so on. In judging rationally how much to assent to a\nprobable proposition, these are the relevant considerations that the\nmind should review. We should, Locke also suggests, be tolerant of\ndiffering opinions as we have more reason to retain the opinions we\nhave than to give them up to strangers or adversaries who may well\nhave some interest in our doing so.\n\nLocke distinguishes two sorts of probable propositions. The first of\nthese have to do with particular existences or matters of fact, and\nthe second that are beyond the testimony of the senses. Matters of\nfact are open to observation and experience, and so all of the tests\nnoted above for determining rational assent to propositions about them\nare available to us. Things are quite otherwise with matters that are\nbeyond the testimony of the senses. These include the knowledge of\nfinite immaterial spirits such as angels or things such as atoms that\nare too small to be sensed, or the plants, animals or inhabitants of\nother planets that are beyond our range of sensation because of their\ndistance from us. Concerning this latter category, Locke says we must\ndepend on analogy as the only help for our reasoning. He writes:\n\n\nThus the observing that the bare rubbing of two bodies violently one\nupon the other, produce heat, and very often fire it self, we have\nreason to think, that what we call Heat and Fire consist of the\nviolent agitation of the imperceptible minute parts of the burning\nmatter\u2026. (IV.16.12, N: 665\u20136)\n\n\nWe reason about angels by considering the Great Chain of Being;\nfiguring that while we have no experience of angels, the ranks of\nspecies above us is likely as numerous as that below of which we do\nhave experience. This reasoning is, however, only probable.\n",
