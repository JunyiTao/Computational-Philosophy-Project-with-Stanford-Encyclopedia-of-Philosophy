    "main_text": "Eight Ways of Dealing with the Repugnant Conclusion || Questioning the way we can compare and measure welfare\n2.2 Questioning the way we can compare and measure welfare\n\nThe Repugnant Conclusion may seem to rely on a certain view about\nwelfare. It treats welfare on an additive scale, where low numbers, if\nadded to themselves often enough, must become larger than any initial\nlarger number. This is like the Archimedean property of the real\nnumbers: For any positive numbers x and y, there is\na natural number n such that nx is greater than\ny. Any finite number of lives in population A can\ntherefore be outweighed by a sufficiently large number of lives in\nZ because the gain in the quantity of lower values outweighs\nthe loss of certain higher values. However, some\ntheorists\u2014including Parfit\u2014have suggested that this\naxiological assumption is mistaken. (Parfit 1986, 2016; Griffin 1986;\nRachels 2001; Crisp 1988, 1992; Glover 1977; Edwards 1979; Lemos 1993;\nSkorupski 1999; Klint Jensen 1996; Portmore 1999; Riley 1993, 1999,\n2008, 2009). The idea is that one type of good \u03b1 can be superior\nto another type of good \u03b2, in the sense that any amount of\n\u03b1 is better than any amount of \u03b2 or that some amount of\n\u03b1 is better than any amount of \u03b2. Suppose that what happens\nas we move down the alphabet from the high-quality population A\nto the low-quality population Z is that the best things in life\nare gradually lost. For instance, as Parfit has suggested, the first\nstep from A to B involves the loss of Mozart\u2019s\nmusic; in the move from B to C Haydn\u2019s music is\nlost; in the move to D Venice is destroyed; and so on down the\nalphabet. All that is left in the final move to Z is\n\u201cmuzak and potatoes\u201d. The claim is that the lives in the\nbeginning of the sequence involve goods that are superior to the goods\ninvolved in the lives at the end of the sequence. The loss of the most\nworthwhile things in life cannot be compensated for by any gain in the\nquantity of muzak and potatoes. Consequently, whatever the number of\npeople in population Z, there will be less welfare, or less\nvaluable welfare, in this world as compared to population A and\nthus the Repugnant Conclusion is blocked.\n\nThis suggested way of blocking the Repugnant Conclusion obviously\npresupposes that the superiority view is justified in the first place\n(for a recent effort, see Parfit 2016). However, even if this is the\ncase, critics have suggested that this view may still be consistent\nwith some versions of the Repugnant Conclusion (e.g., Ryberg 1996b).\nMoreover, the superiority view has other implications that might be\nhard to accept. Assume that there are days of different qualities and\nthat these can be arranged in a descending sequence of goodness or how\nmuch they would contribute to the well-being of a life. It seems\nplausible that there can be such a sequence where the difference in\nquality of any two adjacent days in the sequence is marginal. For\nexample, consider two days of a life that only differ in respect to\none pin-prick in the left thumb. Assume now, as Parfit suggests, that\nthere are days of such quality that some number of these are better\nthan any number of days eating potatoes and listening to muzak. One\ncan then show (Arrhenius 2005; Klint Jensen 2008) that there must be\ntwo types of days, call them \u03b1-days and \u03b2-days, such that\nsome number of \u03b1-days is better than any number of \u03b2-days\nalthough the difference in quality between these days is only\nmarginal.\n",
