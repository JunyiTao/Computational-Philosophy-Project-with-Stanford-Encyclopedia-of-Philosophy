    "main_text": "Knowledge Transmission and Generation || The Generation View\n2.2 The Generation View\n\nOpponents have raised two importantly different kinds of arguments\nagainst TV-N. First, suppose that there is a creationist teacher,\nStella, who does not believe, and thus fails to know, that homo\nsapiens evolved from homo erectus (= p). That is,\nwhile Stella has read the relevant text books on evolutionary theory,\nher creationist commitments prevent her from believing that p\nis true. Now, suppose that during one of her biology lessons Stella\ntells her fourth grade students that p, and suppose that her\nstudents come to believe that p on the basis of Stella\u2019s\ntestimony.\n\nThe argument here is that the fourth graders can come to know that\np on the basis of Stella\u2019s testimony even though Stella\nherself does not believe, and thus does not know, that p is\ntrue. Thus, TV-N is false, i.e., testimonial knowledge can be\ngenerated from a speaker who lacks the knowledge in question.\n(This Creationist Teacher case comes from Lackey (2008). Other school\nteacher cases have been discussed in Graham (2006a) and Carter and\nNickel (2014). Goldberg (2005) and Pelling (2013) also give cases in\nwhich a speaker\u2019s belief is unsafe and does not amount to\nknowledge even though the hearer\u2019s belief\n does).[6]\n\nWhile this first case involved a speaker who did not know that\np because they did not believe it, the second type of objection\nto TV-N involves a speaker who does not know that p because\nthey are not justified in believing it. For instance, consider Persia,\nwho is a persistent believer in the following sense: Persia goes to\nher eye doctor, Eyal, who tells her that the eye drops she was just\ngiven will make her vision unreliable for the next three hours. While\nEyal is a highly reliable testifier, he is wrong on this occasion,\ni.e., for some strange reason, the drops did not have this side-effect\non Persia. However, while Persia has no reason to distrust Eyal, she\nignores him on this occasion, walks out of his office, and sees a\nBadger in the parking lot. Because Persia is a persistent believer,\nshe forms the true belief that there is a badger in the parking lot\ndespite Eyal\u2019s (misleading) testimony about the unreliability of\nher visual faculties. Later that day Persia runs into her friend,\nFred, and tells him that there was a badger in the parking lot (=\np).\n\nThe argument here is that Eyal\u2019s testimony constitutes an\nundefeated defeater that defeats Persia\u2019s justification for\nbelieving that p. However, since Fred is completely unaware\nthat Persia has the defeater, and because he has positive reasons for\nthinking that his friend is a reliable testifier, he does come to know\nthat p on the basis of Persia\u2019s say-so. Thus, TV-N is\nfalse (This Persistent Believer case comes from Lackey [2008]. It is\nworth noting that this case purports to show that testimonial\njustification can also be generated, i.e., Fred can acquire\ntestimonial justification for believing p via Persia\u2019s\ntestimony even though Persia was not justified in believing p\nherself).\n\nIn addition to targeting TV-N, opponents of the Transmission View have\nalso targeted TV-S. Consider for instance, Quinn, who is so infatuated\nwith his friend, Kevin, that he is compulsively trusting, i.e., Quinn\nbelieves anything that Kevin says, regardless of how outrageous\nKevin\u2019s claim may be. One day Kevin testifies to Quinn that he\nis moving to Brooklyn (= p). Kevin is being truthful, and he\nhas terrific evidence that p is true (he is the one who is\nmoving, after all). Unsurprisingly, Quinn believes what Kevin says.\nHowever, Quinn would also have believed Kevin even if he had massive\namounts of evidence that Kevin was lying, or joking, or whatever.\n\nOpponents argue that while Kevin knows that p, Quinn does not,\ni.e., because of his compulsively trusting nature, Quinn\u2019s\nattitude is insensitive to counterevidence in a way that precludes his\nbelief from being amounting to knowledge. Thus, TV-S is false. (This\nCompulsively Trusting case comes from Lackey 2008. See also Graham\n2000b).\n\nMuch of the recent work on whether testimony generates or transmits\nknowledge concerns carefully distinguishing between different versions\nof TV-N and TV-S, and arguing that while some versions may face the\nproblems mentioned here, others do not. See, e.g., Wright (2016a).\n",
