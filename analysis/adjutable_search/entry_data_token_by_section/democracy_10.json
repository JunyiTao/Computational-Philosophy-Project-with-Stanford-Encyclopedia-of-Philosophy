    "main_text": "The Demands of Democratic Participation || Proposed Solutions to the Problem of Democratic Participation\n4.2 Proposed Solutions to the Problem of Democratic Participation\n4.2.1 Elite theory of democracy\n\nSome modern theorists of democracy, called elite theorists, have\nargued against any robustly egalitarian or deliberative forms of\ndemocracy in light of the problem of democratic participation. They\nargue that high levels of citizen participation tend to produce bad\nlegislation designed by demagogues to appeal to poorly informed and\noverly emotional citizens. They look upon the alleged uninformedness\nof citizens evidenced in many empirical studies in the 1950s and 1960s\nas perfectly reasonable and predictable. Indeed they regard the\nalleged apathy of citizens in modern states as highly desirable social\nphenomena.\n\nPolitical leaders are to avoid divisive and emotionally charged issues\nand make policy and law with little regard for the fickle and diffuse\ndemands made by ordinary citizens. Citizens participate by voting but\nsince they know very little they are not effectively the ruling part\nof the society. The process of election is usually just a fairly\npeaceful way of maintaining or changing those who rule (Schumpeter\n1942 [1950: 269]).\n\nOn Schumpeter\u2019s view, however, citizens do have a role to play\nin avoiding serious disasters. When politicians act in ways that\nnearly anyone can see is problematic, the citizens can throw the bums\nout.\n\nSo the elite theory of democracy does seem compatible with some of the\ninstrumentalist arguments given above but it is strongly opposed to\nthe intrinsic arguments from liberty, public justification and\nequality. To be sure, there can be an elite deliberative democracy\nwherein elites deliberate, perhaps even out of sight of the population\nat large, on how to run the society.\n\nA view akin to the elite theory but less pessimistic about\ncitizens\u2019 political agency and competence argues that a\nwell-functioning representative democracy can function as a kind of\n\u201cdefensible epistocracy\u201d (Landa & Pevnick 2020). This view holds that, under\nthe right conditions, elected officials can be expected to exercise\npolitical power more responsibly than citizens in a direct democracy\nbecause each official is far more likely to cast the deciding vote in\nlegislative assemblies (the \u201cpivotality effect\u201d) and\nofficials have more incentive to exercise power with due regard for\nthe general welfare (the \u201caccountability effect\u201d).\nMoreover, under the right conditions, representative democracy allows\nindividuals to assess the competence of candidates for office and to\nselect candidates who are best able to help the community pursue its\ncommitments.\n4.2.2 Interest group pluralism\n\nOne approach that is in part motivated by the problem of democratic\ncitizenship but which attempts to preserve some elements of equality\nagainst the elitist criticism is the interest group pluralist account\nof politics. Robert Dahl\u2019s early statement of the view is very\npowerful. \n\n\nIn a rough sense, the essence of all competitive politics is bribery\nof the electorate by politicians\u2026 The farmer\u2026 supports a\ncandidate committed to high price supports, the\nbusinessman\u2026supports an advocate of low corporation\ntaxes\u2026 the consumer\u2026votes for candidates opposed to a\nsales tax. (Dahl 1959: 69) \n\n\nIn this conception of the democratic process, each citizen is a member\nof an interest group with narrowly defined interests that are closely\nconnected to their everyday lives. On these subjects citizens are\nsupposed to be quite well informed and interested in having an\ninfluence. Or at least, elites from each of the interest groups that\nare relatively close in perspective to the ordinary members are the\nprincipal agents in the process. On this account, democracy is not\nrule by the majority but rather rule by coalitions of minorities.\nPolicy and law in a democratic society are decided by means of\nbargaining among the different groups.\n\nThis approach is conceivably compatible with the more egalitarian\napproach to democracy. This is because it attempts to reconcile\nequality with collective decision making by limiting the tasks of\ncitizens to ones which they are able to perform reasonably well. It is\nnot particularly compatible with the deliberative public justification\napproach because it takes the democratic process to be concerned\nessentially with bargaining among the different interest groups where\nthe preferences are not subject to further debate in the society as a\nwhole.\n4.2.3 Neo-liberalism\n\nA third approach inspired by the problem of participation may be\ncalled the neo-liberal approach to politics favored by public choice\ntheorists such as James Buchanan & Gordon Tullock (1962). Against\nelite theories, they contend that elites and their allies will tend to\nexpand the powers of government and bureaucracy for their own\ninterests and that this expansion will occur at the expense of a\nlargely inattentive public. For this reason, they argue for severe\nrestrictions on the powers of elites. They argue against the interest\ngroup pluralist theorists that the problem of participation occurs\nwithin interest groups more or less as much as among the citizenry at\nlarge. Only powerful economic interests are likely to succeed in\norganizing to influence the government and they will do so largely for\ntheir own benefit. Since economic elites will advance their own\ninterests in politics while spreading the costs to others, policies\nwill tend to be more costly (because imposed on everyone in society)\nthan they are beneficial (because they benefit only the elites in the\ninterest group.)\n\nNeo-liberals infer that one ought to transfer many of the current\nfunctions of the state to the market and limit the state to the\nenforcement of basic property rights and liberties. These can be more\neasily understood and brought under the control of ordinary\ncitizens.\n\nBut the neo-liberal account of democracy must answer to two large\nworries. First, citizens in modern societies have more ambitious\nconceptions of social justice and the common good than are realizable\nby the minimal state. The neo-liberal account thus implies a very\nserious curtailment of democracy of its own. More evidence is needed\nto support the contention that these aspirations cannot be achieved by\nthe modern state. Second, the neo-liberal approach ignores the problem\nof large private concentrations of wealth and power that are capable\nof pushing small states around for their own benefit and imposing\ntheir wills on populations without their consent.\n\nSomin (2013) also argues that government be significantly reduced in\nsize so that citizens have a lesser knowledge burden to carry. But he\ncalls for government decentralization so that citizens can vote with\ntheir feet in favor of or against competing units of government, in\neffect creating a kind of market in governments among which citizens\ncan choose.\n4.2.4 The self-interest assumption\n\nA considerable amount of the literature in political science and the\neconomic theory of the state are grounded in the assumption that\nindividuals act primarily and perhaps even exclusively in their\nself-interest narrowly construed. The problem of participation and the\naccounts of the democratic process described above are in large part\ndependent on this assumption. When the preferences of voters are not\nassumed to be self-interested the calculations of the value of\nparticipation change. For example, if a person is a motivated\nutilitarian, the small chance of making a difference is coupled with a\nhuge accumulated return to many people if there is a significant\ndifference between alternatives. It may be worth it in this case to\nbecome reasonably well informed (Parfit 1984: 74). Even more weakly\naltruistic moral preferences could make a big difference to the\nrationality of becoming informed, for example if one had a preference\nto comply with perceived civic duty to vote responsibly (see\n section 4.3.1 for discussion of the duty to\nvote). Any moral preference can be formulated in consistent utility\nfunctions.\n\nMoreover, defenders of deliberative democracy often claim that\nconcerns for the common good and justice are not merely given prior to\npolitics but that they can evolve and improve through the process of\ndiscussion and debate in politics (Elster 1986 [2003]; Gutmann &\nThompson 2004; Cohen 1989 [2009]). They assert that much debate and\ndiscussion in politics would not be intelligible were it not for the\nfact that citizens are willing to engage in open minded discussion\nwith those who have distinct morally informed points of view.\nEmpirical evidence suggests that individuals are motivated by moral\nconsiderations in politics in addition to their interests (Mansbridge\n1990).\n4.2.5 The Division of Democratic Labor\n\nPublic deliberation in any large-scale democracy will occur within a\ncomplex and differentiated \u201cdeliberative system\u201d, a \n\n\nwide variety of institutions, associations, and sites of contestation\naccomplish political work. (Mansbridge et. al. 2012) \n\n\nMoreover, the deliberative system of a complex democracy will be\ncharacterized by a division of democratic labor, with\ndifferent parts of the system making different contributions to the\noverall system. The question arises: what is the appropriate role for\na citizen in this division of labor? Philosophically, we should ask\ntwo questions. What ought citizens have knowledge about in order to\nfulfill their role? What standards ought citizens\u2019 beliefs live\nup to in order to be adequately supported? One promising view is that\ncitizens must think about what ends the society ought to aim at and\nleave the question of how to achieve those aims to experts (Christiano\n1996: ch 5). The rationale for this division of labor is that\nexpertise is not as fundamental to the choice of aims as it is to the\ndevelopment of legislation and policy. Citizens are capable in their\neveryday lives of understanding and cultivating deep understandings of\nvalues and of their interests. And if citizens genuinely do choose the\naims and others faithfully pursue the means to achieving those aims,\nthen citizens are in the driver\u2019s seat in society and they can\nplay this role as equals.\n\nTo be sure, citizens need to know who to vote for and whether those\nthey vote for are genuinely advancing their aims. This would appear to\nrequire some basic knowledge of about how best to achieve their\npolitical aims. How is this possible without extensive knowledge? In\naddition, there is empirical evidence that those who are better\ninformed have more influence on representatives (Erikson 2015). So, if this task requires\nsome kind of knowledge to do well, how can this be compatible with\nequality?\n\nOne promising response is that ordinary citizens do not need\nindividually to have a lot of knowledge of social science and\nparticular facts in order to make political decisions based on such\nknowledge. Recent research in cognitive science indicates the\nindividuals use \u201ccognitive shortcuts\u201d to save on time in\nacquiring information about the world they live in (Lupia &\nMcCubbins 1998). This use of shortcuts is common and essential\nthroughout economic and political life. In political life, we see part\nof the rationale for the many intermediate institutions between\ngovernment and citizens (Downs 1957: 221\u2013229). Citizens save\ntime by making use of institutions such as the press, unions and other\ninterest group associations, political parties, and opinion leaders to\nget information about politics. They also rely on interactions in the\nworkplace as well as conversations with friends and families.\nPolitical parties can connect ordinary citizens in various ways to\nexpertise because each one contains a division of labor within them\nthat mirrors that in the state. Experts in parties have incentives to\nmake their expertise intelligible to other members (Christiano 2012).\nIn addition, under favorable conditions, political parties stimulate\nthe development of citizens\u2019 normative perspectives and\nfacilitate a healthy public competition of political justifications\nbased on those perspectives (White & Ypi 2016).\n\nPeople are dependent on social networks in other ways in a democracy.\nPeople receive \u201cfree\u201d information (which they do not\ndeliberately seek out) about politics and law in school, through their\njobs, in discussion with friends, colleagues and family and\nincidentally through the media. And this can form a better or worse\nbasis on which to pursue other information. Institutions can make a\ndifference to the stream of free information individuals receive.\nEducation can be distributed in a more or less egalitarian way. The\ncircumstances of work can provide more or less free information about\npolitics and law. People who have jobs with a significant amount of\npower such as lawyers, business persons, government officials will be\nbeneficiaries of very high quality free information. They need to know\nabout law and politics to do their jobs properly. Those who hold low\nskilled and non-unionized jobs will receive much less free information\nabout politics at work. To the extent that we can alter the economic\ndivision of labor by for example giving more place to unions or having\ngreater worker participation, we might be able to reduce inequalities\nof information among citizens.\n4.3 The Moral Duties of Democratic Citizens\n\nWhat are the moral duties of democratic citizens in complex\ndemocracies? In this section, we discuss three important democratic\nduties: (1) the duty to vote, (2) the duty to promote justice through\nprincipled disobedience of the law, and (3) duties to accommodate\ndisagreement through compromise and consensus.\n4.3.1 The Duty to Vote\n\nIt is often thought that democratic citizens have a moral duty to vote\nin elections. But this is not obvious. Individual votes are a causally\ninsignificant contribution to the democratic process. In large-scale\ndemocracies, the chance that any particular citizen\u2019s vote will\ndecide the outcome of an election is minuscule. What moral reason do\ndemocratic citizens have to participate in politics even though\nthey\u2019re almost certain not to make the difference to who gets\nelected? Why shouldn\u2019t they seek to promote the good or justice\nin other ways?\n\nParfit develops an act-utilitarian answer to this question (Parfit\n1984: 73\u201375). Act-utilitarians hold that morally right actions\nmaximize the total expected sum of the utilities of all persons in the\nsociety. Parfit argues that voting might nonetheless maximize expected\nutility if one candidate is significantly superior to the other(s). If\nwe add the benefits to each member of the society of having the\nsuperior candidate win, we get a very large difference in value. So\nwhen we multiply that value by the probability of casting the deciding\nvote, which is often thought to be about 1/100,000,000 in a United\nStates presidential election, we might still get a reasonably high\nexpected value. When we subtract the cost to the voter and others of\nvoting, which is often quite low, from this number, we may still have\na good reason to vote. \n\nOne worry with Parfit\u2019s view is that it faces a version of what\nJason Brennan calls \u201cthe particularity problem\u201d (Brennan\n2011). This is the problem of explaining why citizens ought to promote\nvalue through political participation as opposed to through\nnon-political acts. Voting is just one way of promoting overall\nutility; we need to know the expected utility of the different acts\nthey might perform instead. Even if the argument above is correct, it\nmight be the case that many individuals maximize expected utility by\nnot voting and doing something even more beneficial with their\ntime.\n\nAlex Guerrero argues that citizens have moral reasons to vote because\ncandidates who win by a larger proportion of votes can claim a greater\n\u201cnormative mandate\u201d to govern (Guerrero 2010). Still each\nindividual vote makes only a tiny contribution to the proportion of\nvotes a candidate receives. So, we might doubt the strength of the\nreason to vote that Guerrero identifies. \n\nSome theorists argue that individuals have a moral duty to vote in\norder to absolve themselves of complicity in state injustices\n(Beerbohm 2012; Zakaras 2018). All states commit injustices\u2014they\nmake and enforce unjust laws, wage unjust wars, and much else. And\ncitizens of large-scale democracies have a kind of standing\nresponsibility, by paying taxes and obeying laws, for their\nstate\u2019s injustices of which they must actively absolve\nthemselves The complicity account argues that citizens avoid shared\nresponsibility for their state\u2019s injustices if they oppose those\ninjustices through voting and of public advocacy (Beerbohm 2012).\n\nOne worry is that it is unclear why voting and publicly advocating\nagainst injustice should be thought to absolve responsibility that is\nestablished by paying taxes and obeying laws. Another worry is that\none\u2019s concern to oppose injustice should derive from a more\ndirect concern for the wrongs suffered by victims of injustice rather\nthan a concern with keeping one\u2019s hands clean.\n\nOne sort of account that avoids this worry grounds the moral duty to\nvote in the importance of doing one\u2019s fair share of the demands\nof political justice consistent with public equality. The demands of\ncreating and sustaining just institutions distribute fairly among all\ncitizens (Maskivker 2019). If one fails to do one\u2019s fair share\nof these demands, then one fails to show due regard for the eventual\nvictims of injustice. Furthermore, voting provides citizens with a\nmechanism for doing their fair shares of the demands of making their\ninstitutions just in a way that is consistent with respecting the\npublic equality of fellow citizens. By showing up and casting a vote,\ncitizens can contribute to the collective achievement of justice while\nmaintaining equal decision-making power with fellow citizens.\n4.3.2 Principled Disobedience of the Law\n\nCivil disobedience has long been recognized as a central mechanism\nthrough which democratic citizens may legitimately promote political\njustice in their society. According to the standard view, civil\ndisobedience is a public, non-violent and conscientious breach of law\nthat aims to change laws or government policies. People who engage in\ncivil disobedience are willing to accept the legal consequences of\ntheir actions in order to show fidelity to the law (Bedau 1961; Rawls\n1971: ch. 55). The standard definition of civil disobedience has been\nsubjected to challenge. For example, some argue that the private acts\nin which the disobedient seeks to evade legal consequences can count\nas instances of civil disobedience (Raz 1979; Brownlee 2004, 2007,\n2012).\n\nPerhaps the most common way of justifying civil disobedience argues\nthat the same considerations that ground the pro tanto duty\nto obey the law sometimes make it appropriate to engage in civil\ndisobedience of the law (see, e.g., Rawls 1971: ch. 57; Sabl 2001;\nMarkovits 2005; Smith 2011). For example, Rawls argues that while\ncitizens of a \u201cnearly just\u201d society have a pro\ntanto duty to obey its laws in virtue of it being nearly just,\ncivil disobedience can be justified as a way of making the relevant\nsociety more just (Rawls 1971: ch. 57). Similarly, Daniel Markovits\nargues that members of a society with suitably egalitarian and\ninclusive democratic procedures have a general duty to obey its laws\nbecause they are produced by procedures that are suitably egalitarian\nand inclusive, but that civil disobedience can be justified as a way\nof making the relevant procedures more egalitarian or inclusive\n(Markovits 2005).\n\nIt is easy to see why this constitutes an attractive way of justifying\ncivil disobedience, since it justifies it by appeal to the same values\nthat ground the pro tanto duty to obey the law. On the other\nhand, as Simmons notes, if there is no general duty to obey the law,\nthere would seem to be no presumption in favor of obedience and thus\nno special need for a justification of civil disobedience; obedience\nand disobedience would stand equally in need of justification (Simmons\n2007: ch 4).\n\nAdvocates of the standard approach generally assume that only\ncivil disobedience can be justified in this way. However,\nsome argue civil disobedience does not enjoy a special normative\npresumption over uncivil disobedience. The core idea that\ninsofar as the values that ground a pro tanto duty to obey\nthe law\u2014for example, justice or democratic equality\u2014are\nsometimes best served by civil disobedience of the law, they are\nsometimes best served by covert, evasive, anonymous, or even violent\ndisobedience of the law (Delmas 2018; Lai 2019; Pasternak 2018).\n4.3.3 Accommodate Disagreement Through Compromise and Consensus\n\nDisagreement about what laws, policies, or principles ought to be\nimplemented is a persistent feature of democratic societies. It is\noften argued that citizens and officials have duties to moderate their\npolitical activity in order to accommodate the competing views of\nfellow citizens or officials. Two duties of accommodation are widely\ndiscussed in the literature: duties of compromise and duties of public\njustification.\n\nA compromise can be understood as an agreement between parties to\nadvance laws or policies that all regard as suboptimal because they\ndisagree about which laws or policies are optimal (May 2005). While it\nis widely accepted that there are sometimes compelling instrumental\nreasons to compromise, whether there are intrinsic moral reasons to\ncompromise is more controversial. Some defend intrinsic reasons to\ncompromise based on democratic values like inclusion, mutual respect,\nand reciprocity (Gutmann and Thompson 2014; Wendt 2016; Weinstock\n2013). However, Simon May argues that such arguments fail and that all\nreasons to compromise are pragmatic (May 2005).\n\nAdvocates of the public justification approach to democracy (see\nsection 2.2.2) often argue that democratic\ncitizens and officials have\nindividual moral duties of public justification. John Rawls argues for\na \u201cduty of civility\u201d that requires citizens and officials\nto be prepared to give mutually acceptable justifications for\nimportant laws when voting and engaged in public advocacy. Given the\ninevitability of disagreement about comprehensive moral and\nphilosophical truth in free democracies, the duty of civility requires\ncitizens to appeal to a reasonable \u201cpolitical\u201d conception\nof justice that can be the object of an \u201coverlapping\nconsensus\u201d between different comprehensive doctrines. While\ndifferent theorists motivate duties of public justification in\ndifferent ways, many appeal to the need for exercises of coercive\npolitical authority to respect citizens\u2019 freedom and\nequality.\n5. Democratic Representation\n\nRepresentation is an essential part of the division of labor of\nlarge-scale democracies. In this section, we examine two moral\nquestions concerning representation. First, what sort of\nrepresentative system is best? Second, by what moral principles are\nrepresentatives bound?\n5.1 What Sort of Representative System is Best?\n\nA number of debates have centered on the question of what kinds of\nrepresentative systems are best for a democratic society. What choice\nwe make here will depend heavily on our underlying moral justification\nof democracy, our conception of citizenship as well as on our\nempirical understanding of political institutions and how they\nfunction. The most basic types of formal political representation\navailable are single member district representation, proportional\nrepresentation and group representation. In addition, many societies\nhave opted for multicameral legislative institutions. In some cases,\ncombinations of the above forms have been tried.\n\nSingle member district representation returns single representatives\nof geographically defined areas containing roughly equal populations\nto the legislature and is prominent in the United States, the United\nKingdom, and India, among other places. The most common form of\nproportional representation is party list proportional representation.\nIn a simple form of such a scheme, a number of parties compete for\nelection to a legislature that is not divided into geographical\ndistricts. Parties acquire seats in the legislature as a proportion of\nthe total number of votes they receive in the voting population as a\nwhole. Group representation occurs when the society is divided into\nnon-geographically defined groups such as ethnic or linguistic groups\nor even functional groups such as workers, farmers and capitalists and\nreturns representatives to a legislature from each of them.\n\nMany have argued in favor of single member district legislation on the\ngrounds that it has appeared to them to lead to more stable government\nthan other forms of representation. The thought is that proportional\nrepresentation tends to fragment the citizenry into opposing\nhomogeneous camps that rigidly adhere to their party lines and that\nare continually vying for control over the government. Since there are\nmany parties and they are unwilling to compromise with each other,\ngovernments formed from coalitions of parties tend to fall apart\nrather quickly. The post war experience of governments in Italy\nappears to confirm this hypothesis. Single member district\nrepresentation, in contrast, is said to enhance the stability of\ngovernments by virtue of its favoring a two party system of\ngovernment. Each election cycle then determines which party is to stay\nin power for some length of time.\n\nCharles Beitz argues that single member district representation\nencourages moderation in party programs offered for citizens to\nconsider (Beitz 1989: ch. 7). This results from the tendency of this\nkind of representation towards two party systems. In a two party\nsystem with majority rule, it is argued, each party must appeal to the\nmedian voter in the political spectrum. Hence, they must moderate\ntheir programs to appeal to the median voter. Furthermore, they\nencourage compromise among groups since they must try to appeal to a\nlot of other groups in order to become part of one of the two leading\nparties. These tendencies encourage moderation and compromise in\ncitizens to the extent that political parties, and interest groups,\nhold these qualities up as necessary to functioning well in a\ndemocracy.\n\nIn criticism, advocates of proportional and group representation have\nargued that single member district representation tends to muffle the\nvoices and ignore the interests of minority groups in the society\n(Mill 1861; Christiano 1996). Minority interests and views tend to be\narticulated in background negotiations and in ways that muffle their\ndistinctiveness. Furthermore, representatives of minority interests\nand views often have a difficult time getting elected at all in single\nmember district systems so it has been charged that minority views and\ninterests are often systematically underrepresented. Sometimes these\nproblems are dealt with by redrawing the boundaries of districts in a\nway that ensures greater minority representation. The efforts are\ninvariably quite controversial since there is considerable\ndisagreement about the criteria for apportionment.\n\nIn proportional representation, by contrast, representatives of\ndifferent groups are seated in the legislature in proportion to\ncitizens\u2019 choices. Minorities need not make their demands\nconform to the basic dichotomy of views and interests that\ncharacterize single member district systems so their views are more\narticulated and distinctive as well as better represented.\n\nAdvocates of group representation, like Iris Marion Young, have argued\nthat some historically disenfranchised groups may still not do very\nwell under proportional representation (Young 1990: ch. 6). They may\nnot be able to organize and articulate their views as easily as other\ngroups. Also, minority groups can still be systematically defeated in\nthe legislature and their interests may be consistently set back even\nif they do have some representation. For these groups, some have\nargued that the only way to protect their interests is legally to\nensure that they have adequate and even disproportionate\nrepresentation.\n\nOne worry about group representation is that it tends to freeze some\naspects of the agenda that might be better left to the choice of\ncitizens. For instance, consider a population that is divided into\nlinguistic groups for a long time. And suppose that only some citizens\ncontinue to think of linguistic conflict as important. In the\ncircumstances a group representation scheme may tend to be biased in\nan arbitrary way that favors the views or interests of those who do\nthink of linguistic conflict as important.\n5.2 The Ethics of Representation\n\nWhat moral norms apply to representatives carrying out their official\nduties? We can get a better handle on possible answers by introducing\nHannah Pitkin\u2019s famous distinction between trustees and\ndelegates (Pitkin 1967). Representatives who act as trustees\nrely on their own independent judgments in carrying out their duties.\nNorms of trusteeship are supported in recognition that, given a\nnatural division of democratic labor, officials are in a much better\nposition to make well-reasoned and well-informed political decisions\nthan ordinary citizens.\n\nRepresentatives who act as delegates defer to the judgments of their\ncitizens. These norms might be thought to reflect the value of\ndemocratic accountability. Because the people authorize\nrepresentatives to govern, it is natural to think that representatives\nare accountable to the people to enact their judgments. If\nrepresentatives are not accountable in this way, citizens lose\ndemocratic control over their representatives\u2019 actions.\n\nWhich norms should win out when they conflict? Pitkin argues that the\nanswer varies by context. This seems plausible. For example, if we\ntake the view that citizens primarily have the role of determining the\naims of the society, we might think that representatives ought to be\ndelegates with regard to the aims, but trustees with regard to the\nways of realizing the aims (Christiano 1996). See Suzanne Dovi\u2019s\ndiscussion of representation for a deeper and more nuanced discussion\nof these issues.\n6. Social Choice and Democracy\n\nKenneth Arrow\u2019s impossibility theorem is thought by some to\nprovide a major set of difficulties for democratic theory (Arrow\n1951). William Riker, Russell Hardin, and others have thought that the\nimpossibility theorem shows that there are deep problems with\ndemocratic ideals (Riker 1982; Hardin 1999). Neither of these thinkers\nare opposed to democracy itself, they both think that there are good\ninstrumental reasons for having democracy. \n\nThe basic results of social choice theory are laid out in detail\nelsewhere in the encyclopedia (List 2013). Here we will simply\narticulate the basic result and an illustration. The question of\nArrowian social choice theory is: how do we determine a social\npreference for a society overall on the basis of the set of the\nindividual preferences of the members? Arrow shows that a social\nchoice function that satisfies a number of plausible constraints\ncannot be defined when there are three or more alternatives to be\nchosen by the group. He lays out a number of conditions to be imposed\non a social choice function. Unlimited domain: The social\nchoice function must be able to give us a social preference no matter\nwhat the preferences of the individuals over alternatives are. Non\ndictatorship: the social choice function must not select the\npreference of one particular member regardless of others\u2019\npreferences. Transitivity and completeness: The individual\npreferences orderings must be transitive and complete orderings and\nthe social preference derived from them must be transitive and\ncomplete. Independence of irrelevant alternatives: the social\npreference between two alternatives must be the result only of the\nindividual orderings between those two alternatives. Pareto\ncondition: if all the members prefer an alternative x over\ny, then x must be ranked above y in the social\npreference. The theorem says that no social choice function over more\nthan two alternatives can satisfy all of these conditions.\n\nA useful illustration of this idea involves an extension of majority\nrule to cases of more than two alternatives. The Condorcet rule says\nthat an alternative x wins when, for every other alternative, a\nmajority prefers x over that alternative. For example, suppose\nwe have three persons A, B and C and three\nalternatives x, y and z. A prefers\nx over y, y over z; B prefers\ny over z and z over x; C prefers\nx over z and z over y. In this case,\nx is the Condorcet winner since it beats y, and it beats\nz. The problem with this plausible sounding rule is the case of\na majority cycle. Suppose you have three persons A, B\nand C, and three alternatives, x, y and z.\nIn the case in which A prefers x over y and y\nover z, while B prefers y over z and\nz over x, and C prefers z over x\nand x over y, the Condorcet rule will yield a social\npreference of x over y, y over z and\nz over x. One can see here that the Condorcet rule\nsatisfies all the conditions except transitivity of social preference.\nOne way to avoid intransitivity is to restrict the domain of\npreferences from which the social preference arises. Another is to\nintroduce cardinal information that compares the how much people\nprefer alternatives (violating independence). Another might be to make\none person a dictator. So, this case nicely illustrates that one\ncannot satisfy all of the constraints simultaneously.\n\nRiker argues that the theorem shows that the idea that the popular\nwill can be the governing element in a society is false. If an\nexistence condition for a popular will is a restricted set of\npreferences the question naturally arises as to whether such a\ncondition is always or normally met in a moderately complex society.\nWe might wonder whether a highly pluralistic society with a very\ncomplex division of labor is likely to satisfy the restricted\npreference set condition necessary to avoid cycles or other\npathologies of social choice. Some have argued that we have empirical\nevidence to the effect that modern societies do normally satisfy such\nconditions (Mackie 2003). Others have argued that this seems unlikely\n(Riker 1982; Ingham 2019). This is not merely a defense of unlimited\ndomain. It is a defense of the thesis that normally the collections of\npreferences in modern societies are not likely to have the properties\nthat enable them to avoid cycles.\n\nThe fairness critique from social choice theory is based on the idea\nthat when a voting process meets requirements of fairness, the\nfairness of the process and the preferences may not generate\ndeterminate outcomes. If cycles are pervasive, the outcomes of\ndemocratic processes may be determined by clever strategies and not by\nthe fairness of the procedures (Riker 1982). Three remarks are in\norder here. First, it is compatible with the process being completely\nfair that the outcomes of the process are indeterminate. After all,\ncoin flips are fair. Second, there is some question as to how\nprominent the cycles are. Third, one might think that if the\nconditions which enable opposing sides to strategize effectively are\nthemselves roughly equal, then the concerns for fairness are fully\nmet. If resources for persuasion and organization are distributed in\nan egalitarian way, perhaps the fairness account is vindicated after\nall. This point can be made more compelling when we consider Sean\nIngham\u2019s account of political equality. He includes intensity of\npreference in his account of fairness. This is a departure from the\nArrowian approach, but it is in many ways a realistic one. The idea is\nthat majorities have equal control over policy areas when they are\nable to get what they want with the same amount of intensity of\npreferences. And equality holds generally when all groups of the same\nsize have the same control (Ingham 2019). There remains an extreme\ncase in which all majorities have equal intensity of preference and\nare caught in a majority cycle. But the chances of this happening are\nvery slim, even if the chances of majority cycles more generally are\nnot as small. Even if there are a lot of majority cycles, if the\nissues are resolved in such a way that those majorities that have most\nat stake in the conflict are the ones that get their way, then we can\nhave fairness in a quite robust sense even while having pervasive\nmajority cycles. \n7. The Boundary Problem: Constituting the Demos\n\nIf democratic societies allow members to participate as equals in\ncollective decision making, a natural question arises: who has the\nright to participate in making collective decisions? We can ask this\nquestion within a particular jurisdiction (ought all adults have the\nright to participation? Ought children have the right to\nparticipation? Ought all residents have such rights?). But we can also\nask what the extent of the jurisdiction ought to be. How many of the\npeople in the world ought to be included in the collective\ndecision-making? An easy, though slightly misleading, way of asking\nthis question is, what ought the physical boundaries of a particular\ninstitution of collective decision-making be? We see partially\ndemocratic societies within the confines of the modern nation-state.\nBut we might ask, why should we restrict the set of persons who\nparticipate in making decisions of the modern state just to those who\nhappen to be the physical inhabitants of those states? Surely there\nare many other persons affected by decisions made by democratic states\naside from those persons. For example, activities in one society\nA can pollute another society B. Why shouldn\u2019t the\nmembers of B have a say in the decisions regarding the\npolluting activities in A? And there can be many other effects\nthat activities in A can have on B.\n\nSome have suggested that the boundaries of a state ought to be\ndetermined through a principle of national self-determination. We\nidentify a nation as an ongoing group of persons who share certain\ncultural, historical and political norms and who identify with each\nother and with a piece of land. Then we determine the boundaries of\nthe territory by appeal to the size of the group of people and the\nland they cherish (Miller 1995; Song 2012). This is an appealing idea\nin many ways: shared nationality breeds a willingness to share the\nsacrifices that arise from collective decision making; it generates a\nsense of at-homeness for people. But it is hard to use as a general\nprinciple for dividing land among persons when one of the central\nfacts for many societies is that a diversity of nations, ethnic groups\nand cultures co-mingle on the very same land. \n\nIs there a democratic solution to the boundary problem? A number of\nideas have been suggested. The first idea is that the people ought to\ndecide what the boundaries are. But this suggestion, while it may be a\npragmatic resolution to the problem, seems to beg the question about\nwho the members are and who are not (Whelan 1983).\n\nA second theoretical solution that has some democratic credentials is\nto invoke the principle that all who are subjected to decision making,\nin the sense of who are coerced or have duties imposed upon them,\nought to have a say in the decision making (Abizadeh 2008). This\nprinciple is plausible enough, but it doesn\u2019t get at enough\ncases. The pollution case above is not a case of subjection.\n\nA third proposed theoretical solution is the all-affected principle.\nOne formulation is \u201call affected persons ought to have a say in\nthe decisions that affect them\u201d. This does suggest that when the\nactivities in one state affect those of another state, the people of\nthe other state ought to have a say in those activities. Some have\nthought that this principle tends to lead to a kind of politically\ncosmopolitan principle in support of world government (Goodin 2007).\n\n\nBut the all-affected principle is conceptually quite uncertain and\nmorally deeply problematic, and it provides very little, if anything,\nin the way of a solution to the boundary problem. \n\nFirst, \u201chaving a say\u201d is not clear. Does it require having\na vote in collective decision-making? Or is it also satisfied by a\nperson\u2019s being able to modify another\u2019s action by\nnegotiating with them, as we see when there is bargaining over an\nexternality? This latter version would undermine the idea that the\nall-affected principle has direct implications for the boundary\nproblem. When the United States permits activities that produce acid\nrain in Canada, Canada can negotiate with the United States to lessen\nthe production of acid rain and/or to compensate Canada for the harm.\nAs long as there is a fair and effective system of negotiation, this\nwould seem to satisfy the all-affected principle without giving\nCanadians a vote in American politics or Americans a vote in Canadian\npolitics.\n\nSecond, it is not clear what \u201cbeing affected\u201d means. One,\ndoes a person being affected just mean that there is a change in the\nperson\u2019s situation or must the effect involve the setting back\nof one\u2019s preferences, or interests, or legitimate interests, or\nexercise of one\u2019s capacities or one\u2019s good? Two, are\none\u2019s interests affected by a decision only when they are\nadvanced or set back relative to some baseline (either the present\nstate of affairs or some morally defined baseline like what you have\npromised me), or am I affected by decisions that could be to my\nadvantage or disadvantage but end up making no difference? For\nexample, if I am drowning in a pool and you are deciding whether to\nsave me or go buy yourself a candy bar, am I affected by your buying\nthe candy bar? If I am not affected when no change occurs, then who is\naffected by a decision often depends on who participates in the\ndecision and we have no solution to the problem of inclusion. If I am\naffected, then the principle has some quite extraordinary\nimplications. Now it turns out that impoverished persons in South Asia\nare affected by my buying a candy bar, since I could have sent the\nmoney to them (Goodin 2007).\n\nThe all-affected principle is a merely suggestive and rhetorically\neffective phrase. It is a conversation starter and a list of topics to\nbe discussed, not a genuine principle. For example, if I must include\neveryone possibly affected by my decision for every decision I make, I\nwill not be able to make many decisions and my decision making will no\nlonger enable me to give a shape to my own life and my relations with\nothers. My life becomes fragmented and lacks integrity (Williams\n1973). An analog of this problem would arise for political societies,\npresumably. Each society would have to include a variety of different\npersons in each decision. It is hard to see how any society could take\non any particular character if this is the case. \n\nA more plausible principle that encompasses some of the suggestions of\nthe all-affected principle is that a framework of institutions should\nbe set up so that people have power to advance and protect their\nlegitimate interests in life. \n\nBut if we understand the principle in this way, it is not clear that\nit helps us much with the boundary problem. First of all, there are\ndifferent ways in which people can be said to possess power over their\nlives. One kind of power is the power to participate as an equal in a\ncollective decision-making process. Another kind is to be able to\nadvance one\u2019s interests in a decentralized process like a market\nor a system of agreement making like international law. Recalling our\npollution problem above, we could give the state of which they are\nmembers power to negotiate with the polluting state terms that are\nmutually agreeable. Only the power to participate as an equal in\ncollective decision-making involves the boundaries of collective\ndecision-making. \n\nAnother solution to the boundary problem is a conservative one. The\nbasic idea is to keep the boundaries of states roughly as they are\nexcept if there is a pressing need to change them. Trying to alter the\nboundaries of political societies is a recipe for serious conflict\nbecause there is no institution that has the legitimacy or power\nactually to resolve problems at an international level and there is\nlikely to be a lot of disagreement on how to do it. States as we know\nthem, are by far the most powerful political entities in the\ninternational system. They have developed more effective practices of\naccountability of power than any other entity in the system. They have\ncreated unified societies with highly interdependent populations.\nFinally, states and the individuals in them can be made accountable to\nsome degree to other individuals and states through the process of\nnegotiation and international law making. The origin of these\nboundaries may be arbitrary, but it is not, for all that, irrelevant.\nTo be sure, there are clear cases where borders can be changed. One\nsource of pressing need is serious injustice within a country. Another\nmight be the existence of permanent minorities that are sectionally\ndefined. Here, we ask only how to revise boundaries and the basis of\nsuch revision is that it is a remedy for serious injustice (Buchanan\n1991).",
