    "preamble": "\n\nConstitutionalism is the idea, often associated with the political\ntheories of John Locke and the founders of the American republic, that\ngovernment can and should be legally limited in its powers, and that\nits authority or legitimacy depends on its observing these\nlimitations. This idea brings with it a host of vexing questions of\ninterest not only to legal scholars, but to anyone keen to explore the\nlegal and philosophical foundations of the state. How can a government\nbe legally limited if law is the creation of government? Does this\nmean that a government can be \u2018self-limiting\u2019? Is this\neven possible? If not, then is there some way of avoiding this\nimplication? If meaningful limitation is indeed to be possible,\nperhaps constitutional constraints must somehow be\n\u2018entrenched\u2019, that is, resistant to change or removal by\nthose whose powers are constrained? Perhaps they must not only be\nentrenched, but enshrined in written rules. If so, how are these rules\nto be interpreted? In terms of their original, public meaning or the\nintentions of their authors, or in terms of the, possibly\never-developing, values and principles they express? How, in the end,\none answers these questions depends crucially on how one conceives the\nnature, identity and authority of constitutions. Must a constitution\nestablish a stable framework for the exercise of public power which is\nin some way fixed by factors like original public meaning or\nauthorial intentions? Or can it be a living entity which\ngrows and develops in tandem with changing political values and\nprinciples? These and other such questions are explored below.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Constitutionalism: a Minimal and a Rich Sense\n\nIn some minimal sense of the term, a constitution consists of a set of\nnorms (rules, principles or values) creating, structuring, and\npossibly defining the limits of, government power or authority.\nUnderstood in this way, all states have constitutions and all states\nare constitutional states. Anything recognizable as a state must have\nsome means of constituting and specifying the limits (or lack thereof)\nplaced upon the three basic forms of government power: legislative\npower (making new laws), executive power (implementing laws) and\njudicial power (adjudicating disputes under\n laws).[1]\n Take the extreme case of an absolute sovereign, Rex, who combines\nunlimited power in all three domains. Suppose it is widely\nacknowledged that Rex has these powers, as well as the authority to\nexercise them at his pleasure. The constitution of this state might\nthen be said to contain only one rule, which grants unlimited power to\nRex. He is not legally answerable for the wisdom or morality\nof his decrees, nor is he bound by procedures, or any other kinds of\nlimitations or requirements, in exercising his powers. Whatever Rex\ndecrees is constitutionally valid.\n\nWhen scholars talk of constitutionalism, however, they normally mean\nsomething that rules out Rex\u2019s case. They mean not only that\nthere are norms creating legislative, executive and judicial powers,\nbut that these norms impose significant limits on those\n powers.[2]\n Often these limitations are in the form of civil rights against\ngovernment, rights to things like free expression, association,\nequality and due process of law. But constitutional limits come in a\nvariety of forms. They can concern such things as the scope\nof authority (e.g., in a federal system, provincial or state\ngovernments may have authority over health care and education while\nthe federal government\u2019s jurisdiction extends to national\ndefence and transportation); the mechanisms used in\nexercising the relevant power (e.g., procedural requirements governing\nthe form and manner of legislation); and of course civil\nrights (e.g., in a Charter or Bill of Rights). Constitutionalism\nin this richer sense of the term is the idea that government\ncan/should be limited in its powers and that its authority depends on\nits observing these limitations. In this richer sense of the term,\nRex\u2019s society has not embraced constitutionalism because the\nrule conferring his powers impose no constitutional limits on them.\nCompare a second state in which Regina has all the powers possessed by\nRex except that she lacks authority to legislate on matters concerning\nreligion. Suppose further that Regina also lacks the power to\nimplement, or to adjudicate on the basis of, any law which exceeds the\nscope of her legislative competence. We have here the seeds of\nconstitutionalism as that notion has come to be understood in Western\nlegal thought.\n\nIn discussing the history and nature of constitutionalism, a\ncomparison is often drawn between Thomas Hobbes and John Locke who are\nthought to have defended, respectively, the notion of constitutionally\nunlimited sovereignty (e.g., Rex) versus that of sovereignty limited\nby the terms of a social contract containing substantive limitations\n(e.g.,\n Regina).[3]\n But an equally good focal point is the English legal theorist John\nAustin who, like Hobbes, thought that the very notion of limited\nsovereignty is incoherent. For Austin, all law is the command of a\nsovereign person or body of persons, and so the notion that the\nsovereign could be limited by law requires a sovereign who is\nself-binding, who commands him/her/itself. But no one can command\nhimself, except in some figurative sense, so the notion of limited\nsovereignty is, for Austin (and Hobbes), as incoherent as the idea of\na square\n circle.[4]\n Though at one time this feature of Austin\u2019s theory had some\nsurface plausibility when applied to the British system of government,\nwhere Parliament was often said to be supreme and constitutionally\n unlimited,[5]\n it faces obvious difficulty when applied to most other constitutional\ndemocracies such as one finds in the United States, Canada, Mexico and\nGermany, where it is abundantly clear that the powers of government\nare legally limited by a constitution. Austin\u2019s answer to this\napparent weakness in his theory was to appeal to popular\nsovereignty, the idea that sovereign power ultimately resides in\n\u2018the people\u2019, that is, the population at large.\nGovernment bodies\u2014e.g., Parliament, the President or\nthe judiciary\u2014can be limited by constitutional law, but the\nsovereign people remain unlimited in their powers to command. Whether\nthis appeal to popular sovereignty provides Austin with an adequate\nmeans of dealing with constitutional democracies is questionable. For\nAustin\u2019s sovereign is supposed to be a determinate individual or\ngroup of individuals whose commands to the bulk of the\npopulation constitute law. But if we identify the commanders with\nthe people themselves, then we seem inexorably led to the paradoxical\nresult identified by H.L.A. Hart\u2014the commanders are commanding\nthe commanders. In short, we lapse into incoherence (Hart 1994,\n73\u201378; Austin 1995, Lecture VI).\n2. Sovereign versus Government\n\nThough there are serious difficulties inherent in Austin\u2019s\nattempt to make sense of the people\u2019s ultimate sovereignty, his\naccount, with all its weaknesses, does reveal the need to distinguish\nbetween two different concepts: sovereignty and government. Roughly\nspeaking, we might define sovereignty as the possession of\nsupreme (and possibly unlimited) normative power and authority over\nsome domain, and government as those persons or institutions\nthrough whom that sovereignty is exercised. Once some such distinction\nis drawn, we see immediately that sovereignty might lie somewhere\nother than with the government and those who exercise the powers of\ngovernment. And once this implication is accepted, we can coherently\ngo on to speak of limited government coupled with\nunlimited sovereignty. Arguably this is what one should say\nabout constitutional democracies where the people\u2019s sovereign\nauthority is thought to be ultimate and unlimited but the government\nbodies\u2014e.g., legislatures, Presidents and courts\u2014through\nwhom that sovereignty is exercised on the people\u2019s behalf are\nconstitutionally limited and subordinate. As Locke might have said,\nunlimited sovereignty remains with the people who have the normative\npower to void the authority of their government (or some part thereof)\nif it exceeds its constitutional limitations.\n\nThough sovereignty and government are different notions, and normally\napply to different entities, it nevertheless seems conceptually\npossible for them to apply to one and the same individual or\ninstitution. It is arguable that Hobbes insisted on the identification\nof sovereign and government insofar as he seemed to require a\n(virtually) complete transfer of all rights and powers from sovereign\nindividuals to a political sovereign whose authority was to be\nabsolute, thus rendering it possible to emerge from the wretched state\nof nature in which life is \u201csolitary, poor, nasty, brutish and\n short.\u201d[6]\n In Hobbes\u2019 theory, ultimate, unlimited sovereignty must reside\nin the supreme governmental person or body who enjoys unlimited power\nand authority to rule the commonwealth. Anything less than such an\nultimate, unlimited sovereign would, given human nature and the world\nwe inhabit, destroy the potential for stable government and all that\nit makes possible. So even if \u2018sovereignty\u2019 and\n\u2018government\u2019 express different notions, this neither means\nnor implies that the two could not pertain to one and the same\nentity.\n3. Entrenchment\n\nAccording to most theorists, another important feature of\nconstitutionalism is that the norms imposing limits upon government\npower must be in some way, and to some degree, be entrenched,\neither legally or by way of constitutional\n convention.[7]\n In other words, those whose powers are constitutionally\nlimited\u2014i.e., the institutions of government\u2014must not be\nconstitutionally at liberty to change or expunge those limits at their\npleasure. Most written constitutions contain amending formulae which\ncan be triggered by, and require the participation of, the government\nbodies whose powers they limit. But these formulae invariably require\nsomething more than a simple decision on the part of the present\ngovernment, through e.g., Presidential fiat or simple majority vote in\nthe legislature, to invoke a change. Sometimes constitutional\nassemblies are required, or super-majority votes, referendums, or the\nagreement of not only the central government in a federal system but\nalso some number or percentage of the governments or regional units\nwithin the federal\n system.[8]\n Entrenchment not only facilitates a degree of stability and\npredictability over time (a characteristic aspiration of\nconstitutional regimes), it is arguably a requirement of the very\npossibility of constitutionally limited government. Were a\ngovernment institution entitled, at its pleasure, to change the very\nterms of its constitutional limitations, we might begin to question\nwhether there would, in reality, be any such limitations. Consider\nRegina once again. Were she entitled, at her discretion, to remove\n(and perhaps later reinstate) the constitutional restriction\npreventing her from legislating on some religious matter on which she\nhad strong views, then it is perhaps questionable whether Regina could\nsensibly be said to be bound by this\n requirement.[9]\n On the other hand, were there a constitutional rule or convention\nspecifying that Regina is entitled to remove this restriction only if\nshe succeeds in convincing two thirds of her subjects to vote for the\nchange, then one might feel more comfortable speaking of\nconstitutional limitation. Of course this constitutional meta-rule or\nconvention is itself subject to change or elimination\u2014a fact\nthat raises a host of further puzzles. For example, does such an act\nrequire application of the very rule in question\u2014i.e., two\nthird\u2019s majority vote\u2014or are the sovereign people of\nRegina\u2019s society at liberty to change or expunge it at\ntheir pleasure? If we accept (a) the distinction between\ngovernment and sovereignty urged above; (b) that ultimate sovereignty\nresides in the people whom Regina governs; and (c) that sovereignty\ncannot be self-limiting, (X cannot limit X) then we\nmight sensibly be led to conclude that the constitutional\nmeta-rule\u2014and hence the constitutional regime of which it is an\nintegral part\u2014both exist at the pleasure of the general\npopulation of Regina\u2019s society. Entrenchment may be an essential\nelement of constitutional regimes, but it would seem that\nconstitutions neither can nor should be entrenched against the actions\nof a sovereign people.\n4. Writtenness\n\nSome scholars believe that constitutional norms do not exist unless\nthey are in some way enshrined in a written document (e.g., Rubenfeld\n1998). But most accept that constitutions (or elements of them) can be\nunwritten, and cite, as an obvious example of this possibility, the\nconstitution of the United Kingdom. One must be careful here, however.\nThough the UK has nothing resembling the American Constitution and its\nBill of Rights, it nevertheless contains a number of written\ninstruments which have, for many centuries, formed central elements of\nits constitution. Magna Carta (1215 C.E.) is perhaps the earliest\ndocument of the British constitution, while others include The\nPetition of Right (1628) and the Bill of Rights (1689). Furthermore,\nconstitutional limits are also said to be found in certain principles\nof the common law, explicitly cited in landmark cases concerning the\nlimits of government power. The fact remains, however, that\nhistorically the constitution of the UK has largely taken unwritten\nform, suggesting strongly that writtenness is not a defining feature\nof constitutionalism.\n\nWhy, despite the existence of seemingly obvious counter-examples,\nmight someone be led to think that constitutional norms must be\nwritten rules, as opposed to more informal conventions or social\nrules? One possible\n reason[10]\n is that unwritten rules and conventions are sometimes less precise\nand therefore more open to interpretation, gradual change, and\nultimately avoidance, than written ones. If this were true, then one\nmight question whether an unwritten rule could, at least as a\npractical matter, serve adequately to limit government power. But\nthere is no reason to accept this line of argument. Long standing\nsocial rules and conventions are often clear and precise, as well as\nmore rigid and entrenched than written ones, if only because their\nelimination, alteration or re-interpretation typically requires\nwidespread changes in traditional attitudes, beliefs and behaviour.\nAnd these can be very difficult to bring about.\n5. Montesquieu and the Separation of Powers\n\nDoes the idea of constitutionalism require, as a matter of conceptual\nor practical necessity, the division of government powers urged by\nMontesquieu and celebrated by Americans as a bulwark against abuse of\nstate power? In Regina\u2019s case, there is no such separation:\nlegislative, executive and judicial power all reside in her person.\nBut how, it might be asked, can she be the one (qua judge) who\ndetermines whether her legislation satisfies the prescribed\nconstitutional limitation? Even if, in theory, Regina\u2019s\nconstitution prohibits her from removing her constitutional\nrestriction at will (because she must observe the 2/3rds meta-rule)\ncan she not always choose to ignore her restrictions, or to interpret\nthem so as to escape their binding force? Perhaps Bishop Hoadly was\nright when he said (1717) in a sermon before the English King:\n\u201cWhoever hath an ultimate authority to interpret any written or\nspoken laws, it is he who is truly the Law-giver to all intents and\npurposes, and not the person who first wrote or spoke them.\u201d\n(quoted in Gray 1986, p.12). Although some constitutional limits,\ne.g., the one which restricts the Mexican President to a single term\nof office, seldom raise questions of interpretation, many others\n(particularly those that concern civil rights) are ripe for such\nquestions. Regina might argue that a decree requiring all shops to\nclose on Sundays (the common Sabbath) does not concern a religious\nmatter because its aim is a common day of rest, not religious\nobservance. Others might argue, with seemingly equal plausibility,\nthat it does concern a religious matter and therefore lies outside\nRegina\u2019s legislative competence.\n\nThat constitutions often raise such interpretive questions gives rise\nto an important question: Does the possibility of constitutional\nlimitation on legislative and executive power require, as a matter of\npractical politics, that the judicial power by which such limitations\nare interpreted and enforced reside in some individual or group of\nindividuals distinct from that in which these legislative and\nexecutive powers are vested? In modern terms, must constitutional\nlimits on a legislative body like Parliament, the Duma or Congress, or\nan executive body like the President or her Cabinet, be subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by an independent judiciary?\nMarbury v Madison settled this question in the affirmative as\na matter of American law, and most nations follow Marbury\n(and Montesquieu) in accepting the practical necessity of some such\narrangement. But it is not clear that the arrangement truly is\npractically necessary, let alone conceptually so. Bishop Hoadly\nnotwithstanding, there is nothing nonsensical in the suggestion that\nX might be bound by an entrenched rule, R, whose\ninterpretation and implementation is left to X. This is,\narguably, the situation in New Zealand where the courts are forbidden\nfrom striking down legislation on the ground that it exceeds\nconstitutional limits. Observance and enforcement of these limits are\nleft to the legislative bodies whose powers are nonetheless recognized\nas constitutionally limited (and subject to whatever pressures might\nbe imposed politically when state actions are generally believed to\nviolate the constitution). It is important to realize that what rule,\nR, actually requires is not necessarily identical with what\nX believes or says that it requires. Nor is it identical with\nwhatever restrictions X actually observes in practice. This\nis so even when there is no superior institution with the power and\nauthority to enforce compliance or to correct X\u2019s\njudgment when it is, or appears to be, wrong.\n\nThat constitutional limits can sometimes be avoided or interpreted so\nas to avoid their effects, and no recourse be available to correct\nmistaken interpretations and abuses of power, does not, then, imply\nthe absence of constitutional limitation. But does it imply the\nabsence of effective limitation? Perhaps so, but even here\nthere is reason to be cautious in drawing general conclusions. Once\nagain, we should remember the long-standing traditions within British\nParliamentary systems (including New Zealand\u2019s) according to\nwhich Parliament alone possesses final authority to create, interpret\nand implement its own constitutional limits. And whatever their\nfaults, there is little doubt that many Parliaments modeled on the\nBritish system typically act responsibly in observing their own\nconstitutional limits.\n\nSo the notion of constitutionalism does not seem conceptually to\nrequire the separation of powers advocated by Montesquieu. Nor does\nthat principle seem to be required as a matter of practical necessity\nin all possible cases. Does this mean that separation of powers has no\nplace in a theory of constitutionalism? It could be suggested that,\nrather than seeing Montesquieu\u2019s tripartite distinction of\ngovernment functions assigned to different government branches as a\nnecessary component of the very concept of separation of powers, we\nshould instead understand that concept in a moralized, flexible and\ncontext-specific manner. On this view, separation of powers dictates\nmore generally that distribution of powers be such that a) tasks are\nallocated to those institutions that are well-suited to carry them out\nand b) there are effective checks on the use of government power\n(Kyritsis 2017, ch 2). However, it does not necessarily prescribe\ncertain institutional forms such as judicial review of primary\nlegislation.\n6. Constitutional Law versus Constitutional Convention\n\nThe idea of constitutionalism requires limitation on government power\nand authority established by constitutional law. But according to most\nconstitutional scholars, there is more to a constitution than\nconstitutional law. Many people will find this suggestion puzzling,\nbelieving their constitution to be nothing more (and nothing less)\nthan (usually) a formal, written document, possibly adopted at a\nspecial constitutional assembly, which contains the nation\u2019s\nsupreme, fundamental law. But there is a long-standing tradition of\nconceiving of constitutions as containing much more than\nconstitutional law. Dicey is famous for proposing that, in addition to\nconstitutional law, the British constitutional system contains a\nnumber of constitutional conventions which effectively limit\ngovernment in the absence of legal limitation. These are, in effect,\nsocial rules arising within the practices of the political\ncommunity and which impose important, but non-legal, limits\non government powers. An example of a British constitutional\nconvention is the rule that the British Monarch may not refuse Royal\nAssent to any bill passed by both Houses of the UK Parliament. Perhaps\nanother example lies in a convention that individuals chosen to\nrepresent the State of Florida in the American Electoral College (the\nbody which actually chooses the American President by majority vote)\nmust vote for the Presidential candidate for whom a plurality of\nFloridians voted on election night. Owing to the fact that they are\npolitical conventions, unenforceable in courts of law, constitutional\nconventions are said to be distinguishable from constitutional laws,\nwhich can indeed be legally enforced. If we accept Dicey\u2019s\ndistinction, we must not identify the constitution with constitutional\nlaw. It includes constitutional conventions as well. We must further\nrecognize the possibility that a government, though legally\nwithin its power to embark upon a particular course of action, might\nnevertheless be constitutionally prohibited from doing\n so.[11]\n It is possible that, as a matter of constitutional law, Regina might\nenjoy unlimited legislative, executive and judicial powers which are\nnonetheless limited by constitutional conventions specifying how those\npowers are to be exercised. Should she violate one of these\nconventions, she would be acting legally, but unconstitutionally, and\nher subjects might well feel warranted in condemning her actions,\nperhaps even removing her from office\u2014a puzzling result only if\none thinks that all there is to a constitution is constitutional\nlaw.\n7. Constitutional Interpretation\n\nAs we have just seen, there is often more to a constitution than\nconstitutional law. As we have also seen, constitutional norms need\nnot always be written rules. Despite these important observations, two\nfacts must be acknowledged: (1) the vast majority of constitutional\ncases hinge on questions of constitutional law; and (2) modern\nconstitutions consist primarily of written\n documents.[12]\n Consequently, constitutional cases often raise theoretical issues\nconcerning the proper approach to the interpretation of written\ninstruments\u2014colored, of course, by the special role\nconstitutions play \u2013 or ought to play \u2013 in defining and\nlimiting the authority and powers of government. Differences of view\non these matters come to light most forcefully when a case turns on\nthe interpretation of a constitutional provision that deals with\nabstract civil rights (e.g., the right to due process of law, or to\n equality).[13]\n How such provisions are to be interpreted has been subject to intense\ncontroversy among legal practitioners and theorists, and it is upon\nsuch provisions that this entry will focus. As we shall see, stark\ndifferences of opinion on this issue are usually rooted in different\nviews on the aspirations of constitutions or on the appropriate role\nof judges within constitutional democracies.\n\nAlthough theories of constitutional interpretation are many and\nvaried, they all seem, in one way or another, to ascribe importance to\na number of key factors: textual or semantic meaning; political,\nsocial and legal history; intention; original understanding; and\nmoral/political theory. The roles played by each of these factors in a\ntheory of constitutional interpretation depend crucially on how the\ntheorist conceives of a constitution and its role in limiting\ngovernment power. For example, if a theorist conceives of a\nconstitution as foundational law whose existence, meaning and\nauthority derive from the determinate, historical acts of its authors\nand/or those they represented(ed), and whose principal point is to\nfix a long-standing, stable framework or set of ground rules\nwithin which legislative, executive and judicial powers are to be\nexercised by the various branches of government, she may be inclined\ntowards an interpretive theory which accords pride of place to\nfactors like authors\u2019 intentions or the meanings they (and\nperhaps the general public at the time) would have ascribed to the\nterms chosen for inclusion in the constitution. On what we will call\nthe fixed view of constitutions, it is natural to think that\nfactors like these should govern whenever they are clear and\nconsistent. And the reason is quite straight forward. On the fixed\nview, a constitution not only aspires to establish a stable framework\nwithin which government powers are to be exercised, it aspires to\nestablish one which is above, or removed from, the deep disagreements\nand partisan controversies encountered in ordinary, day to day law and\npolitics. It aspires, in short, to be both stable and morally\nand politically neutral on controversial issues such as\nwhether there should be laws affirming a woman\u2019s right to an\nabortion, or the right of workers to a minimum wage. To be clear,\nsaying that a constitution aspires, on a fixed view, to be morally and\npolitically neutral, is not meant to deny that those who take this\nstance believe that it expresses a particular political vision or a\nset of fundamental commitments to certain values and principles of\npolitical morality. Quite the contrary. All constitutional theorists\nwill agree that constitutions typically enshrine, indeed entrench, a\nrange of moral and political commitments to values like democracy,\nequality, free expression, and the rule of law. But two points need to\nbe stressed.\n\nFirst, fixed views attempt to transform questions about the moral and\npolitical soundness of these commitments into historical questions,\nprincipally concerning beliefs about their soundness. The\ntask is not to ask: What do we now think about values like\nequality and freedom of expression? Rather, it is to ask: What did\nthey\u2014the authors of the constitution or those on whose\nauthority they created the constitution\u2014in fact think about\nthose values? What was their original understanding of them,\nor the understanding among most members of the general population that\nexisted at the time of the constitution\u2019s creation (or\namendment, if the provision in question was introduced at a later\ntime)? So stability and neutrality are, on fixed views, served to the\nextent that a constitution is capable of transforming questions of\npolitical morality into historical ones.\n\nSecond, no proponent of the fixed view will deny that the abstract\nmoral commitments expressed in a constitution tend to be widely, if\nnot universally shared among members of the relevant political\ncommunity. In that sense, then, the constitution, despite the moral\ncommitments it embodies, is neutral as between citizens and their many\nmore partisan differences of opinion on more particular moral\nquestions. Not everyone in a modern, constitutional democracy like the\nUS or Germany agrees on the extent to which the right to free\nexpression demands the liberty to express opinions that display and\npromote hatred toward an identifiable religious or racial group. But\nvirtually no one would deny the vital importance of expressive freedom\nin a truly free and democratic society. On fixed views, then,\nconstitutions can be seen as analogous to the ground rules of a\ndebating society. Each sets the mutually agreed, stable framework\nwithin which controversial debate (and action) is to take place. And\njust as a debating society could not function if its ground rules\ncould be revised by a debater in order to win the debate, a\nconstitution could not serve its role if its terms were constantly\nopen to debate and revision by participants within the political and\nlegal processes it aspires to govern in order to achieve a desired\nresult. We avoid this possibility, according to those who espouse the\nfixed view, to the extent that we are able to replace controversial\nmoral and political questions with historical questions about the\nintentions of constitutional authors in creating what they did, or\nabout how the terms they chose to express constitutional requirements\nwere publicly understood at the time they were chosen.\n\nTo sum up: the desire for stability and neutrality leads modern\nproponents of the fixed view to view constitutional interpretation as\nan exercise which, when undertaken properly, focuses on authors\u2019\nintentions or on original understandings of the meaning and import of\nthe words chosen to express agreed limits on government power and\nauthority. Those who endorse this fixed view generally espouse what\nhas come to be known as originalism. Only if interpreters\nrestrict themselves to original intentions and/or understandings, and\ndo not attempt to insert their own contentious views under the guise\nof \u2018interpretation\u2019, can the role of a constitution be\nsecured. Only then, originalists maintain, can it serve as the\npolitically neutral, stable framework its nature demands.\n\nBut not all constitutional theorists believe that the foundational\nrole of a constitution demands that its meaning and interpretation be\nsomehow fixed, or that its interpretation be absolutely immune from\nconsiderations of moral and political theory and debate. On the\ncontrary, many constitutional scholars and judges embrace living\nconstitutionalism, an approach that sees a constitution as an\nevolving, living entity which, by its very nature, is capable of\nresponding to changing social circumstances and new (and it is hoped\nbetter) moral and political beliefs. Along with this very different\nview of constitutions come very different theories regarding the\nnature and limits of legitimate constitutional interpretation. One\nstrand within living constitutionalism, upon which we will be focus\nbelow, stresses the extent to which constitutional interpretation\nresembles the kind of reasoning that takes place in other areas of the\nlaw pertaining to common law legal systems, such as the law of\ncontracts and torts. Just as the law of contributory negligence\nemerged and (continuously) evolves in common law countries in a\ncase-by-case, incremental manner, over many decades and as the product\nof many judicial decisions, the law of equal protection, free\nexpression, due process and the like (continuously) evolves in modern\nwestern democracies as constitutional cases are heard and decided.\n\nDisputes between fixed-view originalists and living constitutionalists\nare among the liveliest and most contentious to have arisen in\nconstitutional scholarship over the past several decades. Debates have\ntended to focus on abstract civil rights provisions of constitutions,\nsuch as the due process clause of the American Constitution, or\nSection 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which\n\u2019guarantees the right to life, liberty and security of the\nperson and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance\nwith the principles of fundamental\n justice.[14]\n Given the fixed view to which they are committed, contemporary\noriginalists view anything more than an attempt to discover, so as to\npreserve and apply, original understandings of, or the intentions\nbehind, such provisions as constitutional revision or\n\u2018construction,\u2019 often masquerading as the interpretation\nof an unchanged\n original.[15]\n On the other side, we find the living constitutionalists who tend to\nview originalism as a reactionary, overly conservative theory serving\nonly to tie a democratic community to the \u2018dead hand of the\npast.\u2019 Originalists, their opponents claim, render us incapable\nof responding rationally and responsibly to changing social\ncircumstances and improved moral views concerning the requirements of\nthe abstract values and principles articulated and endorsed in modern\nconstitutions. Living constitutionalists, the originalist counters,\nrecommend constitutional practices that threaten a number of cherished\nvalues, among them the rule of law and the separation of powers. They\nare, in effect, happy to place the constitution in the hands of\ncontemporary judges who are permitted, under the guise of\ninterpreting it, to change the constitution to suit their own\npolitical inclinations and moral preferences. And this, originalists\nclaim, only serves to thwart cherished values secured by having a\nstable, politically neutral constitution, and may render all talk of\ngenuine constitutional constraint meaningless.\n8. Originalism\n\nOriginalism comes in a wide variety of forms (Bork 1990;\nScalia 1997; Whittington 1999b; Barnett 2004; Solum 2008). An\noriginalist might claim that her view follows necessarily from a more\ngeneral theory of interpretation: to interpret is necessarily to\nretrieve something that existed at the time of\nauthorship\u2014an original object. Another might be happy to\nacknowledge that interpretation could, theoretically, take the form of\nan innovative or creative interpretation that\nevaluates or in some way changes an original, as might be the case\nwith a revolutionary interpretation of a play or work of art. But such\na theorist might go on to add that, for reasons of political morality\nhaving to do with, e.g., the principles of democracy, the rule of law,\nand values underlying the separation of powers, such innovative\ninterpretations ought never be pursued by constitutional interpreters.\nThe object of constitutional interpretation should, to the greatest\nextent possible, remain fixed by factors like original public\nunderstandings or authorial intentions. Yet another originalist might\nbe content to leave a little leeway here, suggesting something like\nthe following: though there is a presumption, perhaps a very heavy\none, in favor of interpretation as retrieval of an original, it is one\nwhich can, on very rare occasions and for truly exceptional reasons,\nbe overcome. For example, this originalist might say that the\npresumption in favor of retrieval can be defeated when there is a\ndiscernible and profound sea change in popular views on some important\nissue of political morality implicated by an abstract constitutional\nprovision. This was arguably the case in the United States with\nrespect to slavery and equal protection. Presumably \u2018equal\nprotection\u2019 was originally understood, both by the authors of\nthe 14th Amendment and by the people on whose behalf they\nacted, as fully consistent with segregation. This concrete\nunderstanding of equal protection is now, of course, widely condemned.\nIts wholesale rejection served as the main inspiration behind\nBrown v. Board of Education, whose innovative interpretation\nof the equal protection clause arguably changed or replaced the\noriginal understanding of the\n notion.[16]\n Yet another concession, in this\ncase one that seems embraced by all originalists, concerns the force\nand effect of authoritative court interpretations of the constitution.\nMany originalists believe that Roe v.\n Wade[17]\n rested on a mistaken\ninterpretation of the United States Constitution, one that flew in the\nface of original understandings and intentions; but virtually no\noriginalist would have gone so far as to deny, before Roe was\noverturned by the US Supreme Court in \nDobbs,[18]\nthat any contemporary interpretation of the First, Fourth, Fifth,\nNinth and Fourteenth Amendments could be justified only if it can be\nreconciled with that decision. In other words, virtually all\noriginalists agree that established precedent can sometimes override\noriginal understanding. Whether this apparent concession is in the end\nconsistent with the spirit of originalism is, perhaps, questionable.\nSuch \u2018faint-hearted originalism\u2019 (Scalia 1989) may reduce,\nin the end, to a form of living\n constitutionalism.[19]\n Indeed, as we shall see in the next section, the role of judicial\ninterpretations of abstract constitutional provisions is central to\nthat prominent form of living constitutionalism which views\nconstitutional interpretation as resting on a form of common-law\nreasoning.\n\nAnother way in which originalists have split is over the identity of\nthe original object of interpretation. Walter Benn Michaels is among\nthose who defend Original Intent Originalism, the\nview that \u201cyou can\u2019t do textual interpretation without some\nappeal to authorial intention and, perhaps more controversially, you\ncan\u2019t (coherently and non-arbitrarily) think of yourself as still\ndoing textual interpretation as soon as you appeal to something\nbeyond authorial intention...\u201d (Michaels, 2009, 21) Keith Whittington,\nRandy Barnett, and Larry Solum, on the other hand, defend Original\nPublic Meaning Originalism, commonly referred to as New\nOriginalism, which \u201cemphasizes the meaning that the Constitution\n(or its amendments) would have had to the relevant audience at the\ntime of its adoption.\u201d (Solum 2021) Whatever its precise contours, an\noriginalist theory is likely to rest on the fixed view of a\nconstitution. The constitution\u2019s rules and principles are fixed\nby original public meaning or its authors\u2019 intentions and,\n(barring formal constitutional amendment) these must not be revisited\nand revised lest the authority and stability of the constitution be\nthreatened. Original intentions or public meanings must always govern\nthe interpretation of a constitution, not the new value judgements and\ndecisions of contemporary judges (or other interpreters) asking the\nvery same questions the author\u2019s actions and decisions were\nsupposed to have settled. \n\nOriginalism in all its many forms has undergone extensive critique.\nFor example, original intentions and public meaning are often unclear,\nif not largely indeterminate, leaving the interpreter with the need to\nappeal to other factors. In addition, original intentions and\nunderstandings can vary from one person to the next. Sometimes the\nonly things upon which joint authors or members of the relevant\noriginal audience can agree are the particular words to be included in\nthe constitution. The intentions behind that choice can, however, vary\nsignificantly, as can original understandings of what those words\nmean. These can range from the very general to the highly specific. At\none end of the spectrum are the various, and sometimes conflicting,\ngoals and values the authors of a constitutional\nprovision intended their creation to achieve and which an original\ninterpreter might understand the provision to be all about. At the\nother end are the very specific applications the authors\nmight have had in mind when they chose the particular words upon which\nthey settled, and which would generally have been understood by the\nrelevant audience to cover. Did the intended or understood\napplications of an equality provision encompass equal access to\nthe legal system by all groups within society? Or only something\nmore specific like equal access to fairness at trial. Did\nthey perhaps include equal economic and social opportunities\nfor all groups? Different authors might have intended all, none, or\nsome of these applications when they agreed upon the equality\nprovision, and similar things can be said about the corresponding\nunderstandings of members of the original audience. As with the\ngeneral goals and values underlying a provision, there is room for\ninconsistence and conflict. In light of this fact, it can often be\nunhelpful, when interpreting a constitution, to rely exclusively on\noriginal intentions or public meanings.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose, however, that this is not the case: that there is\na way for contemporary interpreters actually to determine,\nindependently of their own moral and political views, either the\noriginal intentions of constitutional authors or what the earlier\ngeneration would have understood the relevant constitutional\nprovision(s) to mean. Would a constitution, understood in one of these\ntwo ways, and serving the role ascribed to it by the fixed view, be a\ngood thing for a democratic society to have? Not according to many\nconstitutional scholars. As noted above, constitutions are intended to\nlast a long time and to span many generations. This is one of the main\nreasons they tend to be entrenched. Suppose that an entrenched\nconstitution has in fact been in existence for a very long time. In\nsuch a scenario, we should distinguish between two groups of people:\nthe people-now and the people-then. According to\noriginalism, it is the understandings and intentions of the\npeople-then that will control the proper application by the people-now\nof constitutional provisions in contemporary settings. In other words,\nthe people-now will in effect be shackled in their attempts to\nexercise political choice by the prior decisions of someone else \u2014\nthe people-then. It\u2019s at the very least questionable whether\nthis scenario is consistent with our understanding of democracy as a\nsystem of ongoing self-government. To be self-governing in an ongoing\nmanner, one must be able to change one\u2019s mind.\n\nHow might an originalist get round this apparent difficulty? One way\nis to note that the so-called dead hand of the past can always be\nremoved through constitutional amendment, difficult as this process\nmight be to engage successfully. A second way is the one generally\npursued by new originalists, who draw a distinction between\ninterpretation, on the one hand, and construction,\non the other. The former is the process of discovering the\ncommunicative meaning or content of words in the text of the\nconstitution, while the latter consists of putting that meaning or\ncontent into effect by applying it in particular cases. (Barnett 1999\n& 2011; Whittington 1999) According to these new public meaning\noriginalists, the dead hand of the past extends only to the\ncommunicative meaning or content of the relevant text and to the\nprocess of interpreting it. And importantly, though the communicative\nmeaning or content of, e.g., \u2018free expression\u2019, \u2018due\nprocess\u2019 or \u2018cruel and unusual punishment\u2019 is the\nsame now as it was when provisions incorporating these notion were\nfirst introduced in, e.g., the US Constitution, that unchanged\ncommunicative meaning is not the primary focus in most controversial\nconstitutional cases where questions of construction take the leading\nrole. Here contemporary interpreters must exercise fresh judgment in\napplying unchanged, but largely uncontentious, original meaning of a\nconstitution\u2019s terms to the complex, new and contentious\nsituations constitutional rights cases being to the fore. They must\nconstruct an understanding of, e.g., the right to free expression that\nallows them to decide controversial cases involving such things as\nonline bullying or attempts to unduly influence voters through the use\nof internet bots. Given the highly abstract nature of this\nconstitutional right, it seems likely that judicial construction will\nplay the leading role in the vast majority of cases involving its\napplication. And if this is so, then whatever reach the dead hand of\nthe past might have, it will end up being quite minimal.\n9. Living Constitutionalism\n\nWhatever else might be said of law, this much is undeniably true:\nwhere law exists, our conduct is subject to various forms of\nrestriction. But in many instances, the relevant restrictions can be\nremoved or changed with minimal effort, as when a problematic\ncommon-law precedent is overturned because of changing social\ncircumstances, or a statute is repealed or amended because it no\nlonger serves useful purposes. Not so with constitutions. As noted\nabove, they tend to be heavily entrenched. Constitutions are also\nmeant to be long lasting, so as to serve the values of continuity and\nstability in the basic framework within which the contentious affairs\nof law and politics are conducted. The entrenched nature of\nconstitutions is largely unproblematic when we consider provisions\ndealing with such matters as the length of term of a senator or which\nbranch of government is responsible for regulating public education.\nBut things get much more complicated and contentious when we turn to\nthe highly abstract, moral provisions of most modern constitutions\nwhich have the effect of limiting the powers of government bodies in\nsignificant ways. These special features of constitutions combine to\ngive rise to a fundamental question, one that causes the originalist\nso much difficulty and to which living constitutionalism purports to\nprovide a better answer: How can one group of people, the people-then,\njustifiably place entrenched constitutional impediments of a decidedly\nmoral nature in the way of a second group of people, the people-now,\nwho might live in radically different circumstances and perhaps with\nradically different moral views? How, in short, can one generation\nlegitimately bind the moral choices of another? A satisfactory answer\nto this intergenerational problem, living constitutionalists\ncontend, requires that we recognize that constitutions can grow and\nadapt to ever-changing circumstances without losing their identity or\ntheir legitimacy.\n\nAccording to living constitutionalists, the meaning or content of an\nentrenched provision like section 3(1) of the German Basic Law, which\nproclaims that \u2018All persons shall be equal before the\nlaw,\u2019 consists in the rights or principles of political morality\nthey express, not what those rights or principles were generally\nunderstood to require at the time of enactment or were believed or\nintended to require by those who chose to include them in the\nconstitution. The choice to employ abstract moral terms (e.g.,\n\u2018cruel and unusual punishment\u2019) instead of more concrete,\nnon-moral terms (e.g., \u2018public hanging\u2019 or \u2018drawing\nand quartering\u2019), is presumably made in recognition of at least\nfour crucial facts: (1) it\u2019s important that governments not\nviolate certain important rights of political morality; (2)\nconstitutional authors do not always agree fully on what concretely is\nrequired in the many scenarios and cases in which those rights are, or\nwill later be seen to be, relevant; (3) constitutional authors can\nanticipate neither the future nor the many scenarios and cases in\nwhich these important rights will be in some way relevant; and (4)\neven when they do agree on what those rights concretely require at the\nmoment of adoption, and are comfortable binding themselves\nand their contemporaries to these concrete understandings, they are\nnot particularly comfortable doing so in respect of future generations\nwho will live in very different times and may think very differently.\nAnd so the decision is made to express constitutional commitments in\nvery abstract terms\u2014\u2018cruel and unusual punishment\u2019\nversus \u2018drawing and quartering\u2019\u2014leaving it to later\ngenerations to substitute their possibly different concrete\nunderstandings for those of the authors or those who lived at the time\nof authorship. The result is that as concrete understandings of the\nentrenched constitutional-rights provisions evolve, the results\nwarranted by these provisions can legitimately change right along with\nthem. And importantly for the living constitutionalist who does not\nwish to surrender to the charge that she counsels infidelity to the\nconstitution, these changes can occur without the constitution having\nchanged, as would be true were a process of formal amendment\nsuccessfully invoked and an abstract, rights provision removed from\nthe constitution.\n\nOne version of living constitutionalism is common law\nconstitutionalism, a view developed and defended by David Strauss\nand Wil Waluchow. (Strauss 2010; Waluchow 2007a) This view seeks to\nconstrain and regulate the evolution of constitutional rights so that\nthey can be both responsive to changing circumstances and yet stable\nenough to accommodate rule of law values such as stability and\ncontinuity. Common law constitutionalists assert that the evolution of\na constitution is governed largely by a body of precedents. As\nprecedents are set in constitutional rights cases, principles and\ndoctrines emerge that are subject to revision as later cases arise.\nAccording to common law constitutionalism, these precedents, and the\nprinciples and doctrines they support, ultimately count as much as the\nwritten text. The former are as much a part of the constitution as the\nwritten document created by constitutional authors. David Strauss goes\nso far as to suggest, in reference to the US Constitution, that \u201cwhen\na case involves the [written] Constitution, the text routinely gets no\nattention. On a day-to-day basis, American constitutional law is about\nprecedents...\u201d (Strauss 2010, 34)\n\nDespite its undoubted appeal, (at least to many) living\nconstitutionalism is subject to a number of significant objections.\nPerhaps the most prominent ones are these: (a) the theory renders all\ntalk of constitutional interpretation, properly understood as the\nretrieval of existing meaning, utterly senseless: constitutional\ninterpretation becomes nothing more than unconstrained, constitutional\ncreation or construction masquerading as interpretation; (b) living\nconstitutionalism robs the constitution of its ability to serve its\nguidance function\u2014how can individuals be guided by a\nconstitution whose application to their conduct and choices will be\ndetermined by the unconstrained views of later so-called\ninterpreters?; and (c) living constitutionalism violates the\nseparation of powers doctrine\u2014if the constitution and its limits\nbecome whatever contemporary interpreters take them to mean, and if\nthose interpreters tend to be found almost exclusively in courts\npopulated by individuals who were appointed not elected, then\ndemocratically unaccountable judges end up deciding what the proper\nlimits of government power shall be, a task for which they are\neminently unqualified and which ought to be reserved for individuals\n(e.g., the authors of the constitution) with the democratic authority\nto serve that function.\n\nLiving constitutionalists have a number of responses to these\nobjections. For instance, it might be argued that the theory in no way\nresults in the unconstrained, arbitrary exercise of judicial power its\nopponents often portray it to be. Living constitutionalists like\nStrauss (2010) and Waluchow (2007a) suggest that the ongoing\ninterpretation of a constitution\u2019s abstract rights provisions is\na process much like the process by which judges develop equally\nabstract, common-law notions like \u2018negligence\u2019 and\n\u2018the reasonable use of force.\u2019 According to Strauss, the\nU.S. constitutional system\n\nhas become a common law system, one in which precedent and past\npractices are, in their own way as important as the written U.S.\nConstitution itself\u2026[I]t is not one that judges (or anyone\nelse) can simply manipulate to fit their own ideas. (Strauss 2010, 3)\n\n\nOn this view, constitutional interpretation must accommodate itself to\nprevious attempts to interpret and apply the abstract rights\nprovisions expressed in the constitution\u2019s text. These prior\ninterpretive decisions serve as constitutional precedents. And just as\nthe traditional rules of precedent combine respect for the (albeit\nlimited) wisdom and authority of previous decision makers (legislative\nand judicial) with an awareness of the need to allow adaptation in the\nface of changing views, and new or unforeseen circumstances, so too\nmust constitutional interpreters respect the wisdom and authority of\nprevious interpreters, while allowing the constitution to adapt so as\nto respond to changing views, and new or unforeseen circumstances.\nLiving constitutional interpretation, though flexible and adaptive, is\nno less constrained and disciplined than reasoning under common\nlaw.\n\nAnother response open to living constitutionalists is to deny that\ntheir theory of interpretation ignores the special role played by a\nconstitution\u2019s text and its authors. The text plays a key role\ninsofar as any constitutional interpretation, innovative as it may be,\nmust be consistent with that text, until such time as it is formally\nchanged via some acknowledged process of constitutional amendment.\nThere is no reason to deny that original understandings of a\nconstitution\u2019s abstract provisions can also be highly relevant\nto later interpretations. This is especially so for interpretations\nthat occur shortly after the constitution\u2019s adoption, when\nworries about binding future generations is not in play. Original\nunderstandings simply cannot be dispositive, at least not in\nperpetuity. In the end, the relative importance of factors like\ntextual meaning, original understandings, later interpretations, and\nintended purposes, may be, as Joseph Raz suggests (1996,\n176\u201391), fundamentally a question of political morality which\ncannot be answered in the abstract and without considering what it is\nthat justifies, at that particular moment of interpretation, having an\nentrenched constitution at all, let alone one with such and such\nparticular content. Sometimes, retrieval of an existing concrete\nunderstanding will be required, especially when the constitution is in\nits infancy and was partly meant to settle a range of concrete moral\nquestions as to the proper limits of government power, at least\nfor a while. But if an interpreter has good reason to believe\nthat this settlement function has been overtaken by other more\npressing concerns, perhaps the need to adapt in light of dramatically\nchanged circumstances or much better moral understanding, then a more\ninnovative interpretation may be called for. And once again, to say\nthat constitutional interpreters must sometimes be innovative is not\nto say that a constitution can be interpreted to mean whatever the\ninterpreter wants it to mean.\n\nYet another response open to living constitutionalists is to note the\nspecial institutional structures that many jurisdictions have adopted\nto lessen democratic worries arising from the key role judges play in\ndeveloping constitutional rights. These concerns are particularly\nacute in jurisdictions, such as the US, where the Supreme Court\neffectively has the final say on the meaning and import of\nconstitutional rights provisions. But not all jurisdictions assign the\nfinal say to judges. The United Kingdom, for instance practices a\nversion of what Mark Tushnet calls \u201cweak-form-review.\u201d (Tushnet 2003)\nIt is the responsibility of the UK Supreme Court to rule on whether a\nprovision of Parliament is compatible with (properly interpreted)\nprovisions of the Human Rights Act. But neither the Court\u2019s\ndecision, nor its interpretation of the relevant right, is binding on\nParliament. Despite the declared incompatibility, Parliament has the\npower to leave its legislation as is. The people-now, through their\nelected members of Parliament, retain the final say on the\ninterpretation and application of the constitutional rights recognized\nin the Human Rights Act.\n10. The Moral Reading\n\nAmong the most influential critics of originalism was Ronald Dworkin,\nfor whom historical factors like original meanings and intentions,\nthough often important, are in no way dispositive in constitutional\nrights cases. They in no way fix the limits of government power until\nsuch time as an amendment passes or the constitution is abandoned or\nreplaced. On the contrary, constitutions set the terms of an ongoing\ndebate about the moral principles and values it enshrines. And as the\npolitical community\u2019s understanding of these principles\ndevelops, the very content of the constitution develops and improves\nalong with it. The framers\u2019 contribution to this process is that\nthey enacted some \u2018general principles\u2019 which future\ninterpreters must constructively interpret (Dworkin 1996, 8\u20139; see\nrelatedly Greenberg and Littman 1998). This arguably renders\nDworkin\u2019s constitutional theory a version of living\nconstitutionalism.\n\nA crucial element in Dworkin\u2019s constitutional theory is his\ngeneral claim that the law of a community, including its\nconstitutional law, includes more than any explicit text or decisions\nauthoritatively adopted or made in accordance with accepted\nprocedures. It does, of course, include many such elements and these\ncan be found, paradigmatically, in statute books, judicial decisions\nand, of course, written constitutions. These are often termed\n\u2018positive law.\u2019 But the positive law in no way exhausts\nthe law according to Dworkin. Most importantly, for our purposes here,\nit in no way exhausts that part of the law referred to as \u2018the\nconstitution\u2019. In Dworkin\u2019s view, a constitution includes\nthe principles of political morality that provide the best explanation\nand moral justification \u2013 i.e., the best interpretation \u2013 of\nwhatever limits have been expressed in positive law, including the\nconstitution and any decisions taken in application of it. Hence,\nconstitutional interpretation must always invoke a theory of political\nmorality. One concerned to interpret the limits on government power\nand authority imposed by a constitution must construct an interpretive\ntheory that provides the written constitution, and the many decisions\ntaken under it, with their best explanation and moral\njustification.\n\nThere are, for our purposes here, three important implications of\nDworkin\u2019s theory of constitutional interpretation. First,\noriginal intentions and understandings at best set the stage for the\nongoing debates of political morality that constitutional rights cases\nboth require and license. They seldom, if every settle matters.\nSecond, constitutional rights cases require the kind of\ndecision-making which is, according to originalism, properly\nundertaken only by those with the authority to fix the limits on\ngovernment power contained within a constitution \u2013 i.e., its authors\nor framers. The kind of morally and politically uncontroversial\njudicial decision-making, within a stable framework established by\nother responsible agents, to which originalism aspires, is simply\nimpossible on Dworkin\u2019s theory. Dworkin\u2019s theory, like (or\nas a form of) living constitutionalism, requires wholesale rejection\nof the fixed view. The constitution is not a finished product, handed\ndown in a form fixed till such time as its amending formula is\ninvoked, or the constitution abandoned or replaced. Rather, it is a\nwork in progress requiring continual revisiting and reworking as our\nmoral and political theories concerning its limits are refined and, it\nis hoped, improved. It is, in short, a living thing.\n\nA third, related implication of Dworkin\u2019s theory, is that judges\nin constitutional cases do not simply implement decisions made by\nothers \u2013 the constitution\u2019s authors or framers. On the\ncontrary, they are partners with the authors in an ongoing political\nproject, one that requires participants, then and now, to engage in\nthe kind of moral and political decision-making which, on the fixed\nview, settled matters when the constitution was first adopted (or\namended). The limits to government power are, on Dworkin\u2019s\ntheory, continually and essentially contestable. Interpreting the\ncontestable terms of a constitution is an ongoing task, requiring that\neach and every interpreter provide her own best, and undoubtedly\nimperfect, interpretation of the limits placed on government by her\nconstitution and the various official decisions taken under it. The\nlatter can never be fixed.\n11. Liberal vs Common Good Constitutionalism\n\nOne\u2019s understanding of how constitutions limit power and how\nthey ought to be interpreted depends, as noted above, on one\u2019s\nconception of their role. For some, that role must be set against the\nbackground of the value pluralism that is characteristic of many\nmodern societies. In light of this pluralism, they say, constitutions\nshould not be committed to a particular understanding of the good but\nshould, rather, serve to guarantee those essentials of political\njustice adherence to which is necessary for legitimating government\npower to citizens who hold a variety of comprehensive doctrines, that\nis, conceptions of justice and the good life. This so-called\n\u2018liberal principle of legitimacy\u2019 is taken to issue in an\naustere list of \u2018constitutional essentials\u2019 (Rawls 1996,\n227ff; Michelman 2022, 51ff; Sager 2004, ch 8). According to one\nsuggestion, the liberal principle of legitimacy sits more comfortably\nwith the fixed view of constitutions and their meaning. Arguably, it\nis better served when the interpretation of constitutional essentials\ntrack their \u2018central range\u2019 (Rawls 1996, 273), thus\npresumably eliciting broad convergence. However, for other authors\nsuch as Michelman, the liberal principle of legitimacy might in fact\nbe satisfied by a certain mode of constitutional argument, one\noriented towards reciprocity, even when its application to concrete\nconstitutional issues is disputed (Michelman 2022, 105 ff). In this\npicture, reciprocity takes seriously the fact of value pluralism and\nthe corresponding requirement that constitutional arrangements be\nacceptable to all. But its precise contours are sensitive to the\nsuitably constrained moral judgment of citizens and officials.\n\nOpposing this approach is common good constitutionalism, according to\nwhich constitutions, even of pluralistic societies like the United\nStates, are geared towards advancing \u2013 and must be interpreted in\nlight of \u2013 a robust, unitary vision of the common good of society.\nAccording to its foremost contemporary proponent, Adrian Vermeule,\nconstitutions and constitutional interpretation \u201cshould be based\non the principles that government helps direct persons, associations,\nand society generally toward the common good, and that strong rule in\nthe interest of attaining the common good is entirely\nlegitimate\u201d (Vermeule 2020). More specifically:\n\n[t]his approach should take as its starting point substantive moral\nprinciples that conduce to the common good, principles that officials\n(including, but by no means limited to, judges) should read into the\nmajestic generalities and ambiguities of the written Constitution.\nThese principles include \u2026 a candid willingness to\n\u2018legislate morality\u2019 \u2013 indeed, a recognition that\nall legislation is necessarily founded on some substantive conception\nof morality, and that the promotion of morality is a core and\nlegitimate function of authority. Such principles promote the common\ngood and make for a just and well-ordered society. (Vermeule 2020)\n\n\nVermeule\u2019s constitutional theory, further developed in his\nCommon Good Constitutionalism, arguably represents a new\nalternative to the constitutional theories discussed above. But\nperhaps not. Vermeule himself characterizes his view as\n\u2018methodologically Dworkinian,\u2019 noting that it\n\u201cadvocates a very different set of substantive moral commitments\nand priorities from Dworkin\u2019s, which were of a conventionally\nleft-liberal bent\u201d (Vermeule 2020). This may lead one to wonder\nwhether Vermeule\u2019s theory truly is an alternative to\nDworkin\u2019s theory of constitutions and their interpretation, or\ninstead an alternative account of the conclusions Dworkin\u2019s\nideal judge, Hercules, (a mythical judge who always gets things right\nand whose decisions set the standard fallible judges strive to meet)\nwould draw were he to set out to offer a grand interpretation of US\nconstitutional law. (On Hercules, see Dworkin 1986, 239 ff.) Whatever\nanswer one provides to this question, it is nevertheless worth\nconsidering whether the moral vision underlying Vermeule\u2019s\ncommon good constitutionalism is one that only religious conservatives\nwho share his moral views can endorse. And if it is, then should it\nframe our understanding of the nature and role of the constitutions of\nwestern liberal democracies? There is also the concern that common\ngood constitutionalism has the potential to untether constitutional\ninterpretation from both constitutional text and constitutional\nprecedent, thus providing judges with far too much power to use the\nlaw to further that particular moral vision. (See, e.g., Barnett\n2020)\n12. Critical Theories\n\nAlthough constitutionalism has been widely embraced round the world,\nit is by no means without its detractors. This is especially true when\nwe turn to those constitutions that not only create and regulate the\noffices of government but also purport to protect abstract rights of\npolitical morality. Some critics\u2014we\u2019ll call these the\nhard critics\u2014assert that such apparently\nrights-protective constitutions cannot effectively and legitimately\nserve to protect individuals against the oppressive forces of\n governments.[20]\n On the contrary, they\nonly serve to shroud legal and political practice in a false cloak of\nlegitimacy. Other critics\u2014we\u2019ll call these the\ndemocratic critics\u2014are not so utterly dismissive of\nrights-protecting constitutions. Rather, their main concern is to\nchallenge the role that democratically unaccountable judges typically\nplay in the interpretation and application of constitutional rights.\nThis concern appears to arise most forcefully in relation to the\ninterpretive theories of Dworkin, the moral judgments of common good\nconstitutionalism and the judicial precedents of living\nconstitutionalists. But the concern is no less acute when we consider\nnew originalism and the ways in which it resorts to the constitutional\nconstructions of judges.\n\nAccording to hard critics, factors like original understandings and\nthe supposed discipline of common law reasoning seldom, if ever,\nsucceed in establishing meaningful limits upon government power. As a\nresult, reliance on such factors in constitutional adjudication only\nserves: (a) to rationalize the purely political decisions of judges\npursuing, consciously or not, their own political ideologies. Further\nconsequences include: (b) a serious affront to democracy. In most\nconstitutional democracies, the judges who ultimately decide\nconstitutional cases are appointed, not elected. That is, they hold\noffice not because they were selected to do so by the democratic\ncommunity, but because of a decision on the part of a President, a\nPrime Minister, a small group of fellow judges, or a judicial\ncommittee of Parliament. Furthermore, these appointed judges tend to\ncome from the privileged classes of society. The end result is a small\ngroup of unelected, elitist judges with the power to substitute their\nown, highly contentious views about the proper limits of government\npower for the considered judgments of the people\u2019s\nrepresentatives, e.g., those members of Congress or Parliament duly\nelected to exercise, on behalf of the people, the latter\u2019s\nsovereign right to participate in political decisions affecting their\nbasic rights. And possibly (c): suppression of those\u2014women,\nminority racial groups, the poor, and so on\u2014whose interests are\nnot adequately recognized and protected by the dominant, mainstream\nideologies to which these elite judges have an affinity. Instead of\nthe curbing of rights-threatening government power for which the idea\nof constitutionalism is supposed to stand, we have political\nsuppression disguised in a cloak of false constitutional\nlegitimacy.\n\nSo hard critics are highly skeptical of constitutional practice and of\nthose theories that applaud constitutionalism as a bulwark against\n oppression.[21]\n As noted at the outset\nof this entry, a key element in the idea of constitutionalism is that\ngovernment can/should be limited in its powers and that its authority\ndepends on observance of those limits. It was further noted that the\nauthority of constitutions in constitutional democracies is generally\nthought to rest with \u2018the people.\u2019 One further claim of\nhard critical theories is: (d) that the concept of \u2018the\npeople\u2019 is very much a fabrication. Instead of being composed of\na group of individuals united in their concern for basic rights,\nwestern societies are comprised of various groups competing either for\ndomination (e.g., white males and the wealthy) or for recognition and\nthe elimination of oppression (e.g., the poor, women, and racial\nminorities). The law, including constitutional law, is a powerful tool\nwhich has, historically, been utilized by dominant groups to secure\nand maintain their superior status.\n\nA particularly vivid example of this last consequence is arguably\nfound in Lochner v New York, a notorious case in which the\nUnited States Supreme Court ruled that a New York State law requiring\nthat bakery employees work no more than ten hours per day and sixty\nhours per week violated the Fourteenth Amendment, which asserts that\nno State may \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property,\nwithout due process of\n law.\u201d.[22]\n The Fourteenth\nAmendment, the Court held, entails \u2018the right and liberty of the\nindividual to contract\u2019 for a longer work week. The\nLochner decision gave rise to what is commonly called\n\u2018the Lochner era,\u2019 a period stretching roughly\nfrom 1905 till 1937 in which the Supreme Court struck down numerous\nFederal and State statutes aimed at improving the working conditions\nof employees. As such, it may well have been a period during which the\nUnited States Constitution, in the hands of an elitist Court, served\nonly to legitimize overt political suppression. According to hard\ncritics, the Lochner era is but one small piece of a much\nlarger picture.\n\nTo sum up, according to hard critics, a constitution is anything but\nthe protection from unwarranted government power that its champions\nhave heralded over the centuries. What is taken to be the obvious\nmeaning of a key term like \u2018equal before the law\u2019 is what\nthe dominant group understands or claims it to be. What is taken to be\nthe obvious original understandings or historical intentions of the\nconstitution\u2019s authors are whatever understandings or intentions\nfit the ideologies of the dominant groups. What is taken to be the\nbest articulation of the right to equality emerging from a fair and\ndisciplined common-law analysis of that right, from a Dworkinian\ninterpretive theory, or from an articulation of the common good is\nnothing but a rationalization of current social structures, all of\nwhich systematically oppress the interests of women, minorities and\nthe poor.\n\nAs noted above, democratic critics tend not to be as utterly\ndismissive of constitutions and constitutional rights protections as\ntheir more hard-line cousins. Their principal objections revolve\naround a practice with which these aspects of modern constitutional\nregimes are typically associated: judicial or constitutional\nreview. This is the practice whereby courts are sometimes called\nupon to review a law or some other official act of government (e.g.,\nthe decision of an administrative agency like the US Food and Drug\nAdministration or the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications\nCommission) to determine its compatibility with the\n constitution.[23]\n Particular instances of\nthis practice vary considerably. As noted above, in some\njurisdictions, such as the United States, judicial review includes the\npower to \u2018strike down\u2019 or nullify a law duly passed by a\nlegislature body or administrative body and the decision is final and\nirreversible. In other jurisdictions, the courts either do not have\nthe power to strike down or nullify, or a decision to do so is\nreversible by some other body of government. As we saw, courts in the\nUnited Kingdom do not have the power to invalidate Parliament\u2019s\nlegislation, that is, declare it void and of no force and effect. But\nthey do have the authority, under section 4 of the Human Rights Act\n1998, officially to declare legislation incompatible with The\nHuman Rights Act. Upon such a declaration, Parliament usually\nundertakes to amend or repeal the offending legislation. But should it\nchose not to do so, the legislation remains valid and the courts have\nno further legal recourse. In Canada, the Supreme Court has the power\nto strike down a law which it believes unjustifiably infringes a right\nguaranteed in Sections 2 or 7\u201315 of The Canadian Charter of\nRights and Freedoms, but Section 33 of that same Charter\ngrants Parliament or the legislature of a province the power to\noverride that decision. This co-called \u2018notwithstanding\nclause\u2019 allows Parliament or a provincial legislature to declare\nthat, notwithstanding its unjustifiable infringement of an enumerated\nright, the offending legislation will stand as constitutionally valid.\nInsofar as these two versions of weak-form review leave the final\ndecision regarding the meaning and scope of a constitutional right and\nthe limits it imposes on government powers in the hands of the\nlegislature, it is touted by its defenders as consistent with\ndemocratic principle. According to critics of weak-form review,\nhowever, the practice strips the constitution of one of its most vital\nfunctions: the protection of individual and minority rights against\nwhat Mill, following de Tocqueville, famously called \u2018the\ntyranny of the\n majority.\u2019[24]\n\n\nAmong the most influential of contemporary democratic critics is\nJeremy Waldron. Waldron is, to put it mildly, no fan of constitutional\nreview. Nor is he enamored of the grandiose constitutional charters\nand bills of rights which serve as the most contentious ground in\nterms of which that power is often exercised by courts. According to\nWaldron and his fellow democratic critics, constitutional review under\nan entrenched charter or bill of rights is fraught with both\ntheoretical and practical difficulty. It threatens democracy and is\nboth fundamentally unfair and politically dangerous. It also relies on\noutmoded views about the nature of moral rights\u2014that there are\nobjective, universal rights of political morality to which charters or\nbills of rights make reference, upon which there is widespread\nagreement within democratic communities, and to which judges can\nsensibly and justifiably be asked to appeal in protecting citizens\nagainst recalcitrant exercises of government power. While it is true\nthat constitutional review need not be based on an appeal to abstract\nrights of political morality (it could, for example, be restricted to\nquestions such as whether Congress or a provincial legislature has\nfollowed proper procedure) and true that it need not include the\nability actually to strike down legislation, the main focus of\ndemocratic critics has been on strong-form constitutional review which\nexemplifies these two features.\n\nAccording to democratic critics it is difficult to underestimate the\nconsiderable power which constitutional review under an entrenched\ncharter or bill of rights places in the hands of judges who are, in\nmodern constitutional democracies, typically unelected and hence not\ndirectly accountable to the democratic community. Despite their lack\nof accountability, these judges are assigned the task of providing\nauthoritative answers to the deeply controversial questions of\npolitical morality that arise under constitutional review and with\nrespect to which there is so much deep disagreement. Examples can\nrange from the permissibility of abortion or physician-assisted\nsuicide, to the banning of hate speech or the publication of violent\nand degrading pornography on the internet. On the basis of these highly\ncontroversial answers they end up determining what shall be deemed\nlawful in the community. This is far too much political power for a\nsmall group of unelected people to wield over an entire democratic\ncommunity, no matter how learned and wise they might happen to be. But\nperhaps more importantly, the granting of such power is fundamentally\nundemocratic in principle: individual citizens have, in effect, been\ndisenfranchised by this arrangement. Each citizen of voting age should\nhave an equal right, in a democratic society, to contribute to the\ncreation of the laws by which she is governed. This she exercises\ndirectly via the ballot box and by whatever contributions to public\ndiscourse and debate about controversial issues she chooses to make.\nShe also does so indirectly via the legislative votes of her elected\nrepresentatives, whose task is to represent her interests and\nopinions. Yet with strong-form constitutional review all this has been\nreplaced by subjection to the pronouncements of judges. The duly\nconsidered views of citizens and their representatives about the laws\nby which they are to be governed, arrived at (it is hoped) through\nfair processes of democratic decision-making, have, in effect, been\nset aside in favour of the contentious moral pronouncements of a\nhandful of democratically unaccountable, elite judges. This unhappy\nsituation is further exacerbated by the undeniable fact that judges on\nappeal courts often disagree vehemently among themselves about rights\nof political morality and must often, in the end, rely on majority\nvoting to settle their own disagreements. It is not at all uncommon to\nsee split votes when a court deals with a contentious issue of moral\nprinciple like affirmative action, abortion or pornography. And often\nthese split votes follow patterns which are closely correlated with\nthe all too discernible political leanings of\n judges.[25]\n  Add to this the fact\nthat judges render decisions which all too often appear to conflict\nnot only with views widely shared in the community at large, but also\nwith their own previous decisions in earlier cases, and what might\nseem like a marvelous idea in the abstract\u2014constitutionally\nguaranteeing moral rights and fundamental interests against the abuse\nof government power\u2014is transformed into a living nightmare. A\nnightmare in which democracy, fairness and the rule of law have, in\neffect, been abandoned and replaced by the rule of a few men and\nwomen, by a kind of \u2018judicial oligarchy.\u2019 And no matter\nthe high esteem in which we tend to hold our judges in modern\nconstitutional democracies, this is not a form of government to be\neagerly embraced.\n\nCritical theories, both hard and democratic, represent a serious\nchallenge not only to conventional theories and established practices\nof constitutional interpretation, but to the very idea of\nconstitutionalism itself\u2014the idea that government can and should\nbe limited in ways that serve to protect us from unwarranted state\npower. According to originalism, the constitution protects us from\njudges and other officials by restricting them (largely) to\npolitically and morally uncontroversial, neutral decisions about\nhistorical intentions and understandings. According to one strand of\nliving constitutionalism, our evolving constitution can do the same\nwhile at the same time allowing the constitution to grow and adapt to\nchanging circumstances and (it is hoped) better moral understandings.\nIt can effect this balancing act so long as the judges, in whom the\npower of constitutional interpretation and enforcement has largely\nbeen placed, are willing to subject their deliberations to the\ndiscipline of common law reasoning. Critics, however, remain highly\nskeptical. Ordinary judges are not, critical theorists will insist,\nPlatonic kings and queens, dispensing justice in the light of\nobjective moral truth. We must always remember, critics insist, that\nour judges are ordinary, flawed human beings with all the intellectual\nand moral shortcomings, weaknesses and biases of their fellow human\nbeings. They are also, more often than not, members of a dominant\ngroup (e.g., wealthy, white males) who share the social background,\neducation, perspective, and moral values of that group. But if\nconstitutions are all at the mercy of dominant ideologies and the\nwhims and convictions of elite judges, then the kind of protections\nheralded by the idea of constitutionalism may be a myth, and a harmful\none at that.\n\nSo what is the solution according to critical theorists? The proffered\nsolutions can vary considerably, depending on how hard-line the\ntheorist tends to be. A theocrat might advocate the complete overthrow\nof constitutional, democratic government, while a liberal feminist\ncritic might be content to work within existing constitutional systems\nto eradicate the vestiges of patriarchy which have survived recent\nfeminist movements (MacKinnon, 1989; Strossen 1995). Waldron and his\nfellow democratic critics ague that we should abandon the practice of\nconstitutional review of legislation under entrenched charters or\nbills of rights and leave political decisions where they belong: the\npeople and their elected and accountable representatives (Waldron,\n1992, 2006; Marmor, 2007). Yet another avenue of response is to\nhighlight the extent to which the critics\u2019 most powerful\nobjections apply only to strong-form review, where judicial decisions\nare final and can have the effect of nullifying the efforts of\ndemocratically accounted legislatures. Having pointed this out, the\nnext move is to recommend weaker forms of review which arguably\nreflect a healthier balance between respect for fundamental rights, on\nthe one hand, and the importance of democratic procedure on the other\n(Gardbaum, 2013). Were an effective version of something like\nCanada\u2019s Section 33 override included within a constitution, the\ncourts might well be able to maintain their intended role as defenders\nof rights, while leaving the final word to the legislature in cases\nwhere intractable differences of opinion run\n deep.\n\nIn recent years another solution has been offered by populism.\nAlthough often seen as antithetical to constitutionalism (M\u00fcller\n2016) because of its perceived tendency towards totalitarianism,\npopulism could instead be viewed as a reaction to a specific form of\nconstitutionalism and the type of constitutional practice to which it\nlends itself (Vergara 2020). Thus understood, populism targets\nconstitutional constraints that take political power away from the\npeople and place it in the hands of elites, most notably the judges\nwho decide constitutional cases but also, to some extent, elected\nrepresentatives. Conversely, it favors constitutional arrangements\nthat allow for or encourage broad public participation and\ndeliberation in respect of controversial issues of political morality,\nespecially with a view to empowering and engaging in the political\nprocess the marginalised and excluded segments of society (Gargarella\n2022). Although this solution is animated by egalitarianism, just like\nWaldron and other democratic critics, it insists that it is not enough\nto point to the legislature \u2013even a reasonably well formed\none\u2013 as the forum that vindicates political equality. Indeed, we\nmay have to look beyond traditional institutional forms to\nreinvigorate the polity.\n\nWhatever the preferred solution, all critics of constitutionalism seem\nto agree that progress can be made only if the myths surrounding\nconstitutional protection\u2014the constraining force of original\nunderstanding, intention, history, the discipline of common law, and\nso on\u2014 are all exposed, and that the true political forces at\nwork in constitutional practice are acknowledged and dealt with\nopenly. Whether the idea of constitutionalism can survive the lessons\nof such critical scrutiny is a very good question.\n",
