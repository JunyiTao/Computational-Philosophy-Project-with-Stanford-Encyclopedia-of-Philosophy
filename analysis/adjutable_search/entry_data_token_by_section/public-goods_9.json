    "main_text": "The Private Provision of Public Goods || Other Mechanisms\n4.2 Other Mechanisms\n\nAn alternative reason for existence of privately provided public goods\nis that people do not always act in a fully self-interested manner.\nMost economic models assume that people care only about the benefits a\npublic good provides to them, but people in fact also care about the\noutcomes for others. Donations to charity and political campaigns are\nobvious examples. One way to model this is to assume that the act of\ngiving itself provides additional utility distinct from the utility\nobtained from the aggregate level of provision of the public good\n(Steinberg 1987).\n\nA third reason for the ability of public goods to be provided\nprivately to be discussed here is the existence of social norms. For\nexample, as long as individuals meet repeatedly to decide\nabout the creation of a public good, they might realise that lying is\nself-destructive, and as the situation is iterated, it is possible\nthat a norm of truthful revelation of the valuations is developed upon\nwhich a convention of telling the truth would be built (Taylor 1976;\nSchotter 1981). That a non-co-operative strategy is not necessarily\noptimal in repeated games is a well-known result in game theory (see\nentry on\n game theory, section on repeated games and coordination).\n\nOther norms such as \u201ceveryone should do their bit\u201d or\nfairness and equality norms can also help to increase private\ncontributions to public goods. People might simply think that it is\nmorally wrong to free ride (Sugden 1984). Social norms can motivate\npeople to act altruistically but also help to solve co-ordination\nproblems by specifying property rights and the terms of contracts\n(Young 1998). Clean streets (the absence of littering) can be regarded\nas a public good, and let us assume that littering isn\u2019t\npunishable by law. In a game-theoretic setting, individuals would be\nexpected to underproduce the public good, i.e., to litter too much. A\nnorm not to litter can now help to induce people to co-operate and\nplay the non-Nash equilibrium but Pareto superior strategy. The\npunishment of norm-violators through social sanctions will help to\nmake people follow the norm without the government having to police\nnorm following.\n\nMost mechanisms discussed in this section can be expected to work\nbetter for local public goods than for national or global public\ngoods. It is easier to negotiate with neighbours about littering than\nwith people who live halfway across the globe, and people tend to feel\nmore altruistic towards others who live nearby and are in other ways\nsimilar (Hamilton 1964).\n",
