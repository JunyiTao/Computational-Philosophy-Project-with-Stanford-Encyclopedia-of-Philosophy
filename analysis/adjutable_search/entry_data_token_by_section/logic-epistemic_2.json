    "main_text": "The Modal Approach to Knowledge || The Formal Language of Epistemic Logic\n2.1 The Formal Language of Epistemic Logic\n\nRecent work in epistemic logic relies on a modal conception of\nknowledge. In order to be clear about the role of modality in\nepistemic logic it is helpful to introduce the basic elements of the\nmodern formalism. For the sake of simplicity we begin with the case of\nknowledge and belief for a single agent, postponing consideration of\nmultiple agents to\n Section 3,\n\nA prototypical epistemic logic language is given by first fixing a set\nof propositional variables \\(p_{1}\\), \\(p_{2}\\),\u2026. In\napplications of epistemic logic, propositional variables are given\nspecific interpretations: For example, \\(p_{1}\\) could be taken to\nrepresent the proposition \u201cthere is a hen in the yard\u201d and\n\\(p_{2}\\) the proposition \u201cthere is a dog in the yard\u201d,\netc. The propositional variables represent propositions which are\nrepresented in no finer detail in the formal language. As such, they\nare therefore often referred to as atomic propositions or\nsimply atoms. Let Atom denote the set of atomic\npropositions.\n\nApart from the atomic propositions, epistemic logic supplements the\nlanguage of propositional logic with a modal operator, \\(K_{a}\\), for\nknowledge and \\(B_{a}\\), for belief.\n\n\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) reads \u201cAgent a knows that\n\\(\\varphi\\)\u201d\n\n\nand similarly\n\n\n\\(B_{a}\\varphi\\) reads \u201cAgent a believes that\n\\(\\varphi\\)\u201d.\n\n\nIn many recent publications on epistemic logic, the full set of\nformulas in the language is given using a so-called Backus-Naur\nForm (BNF). This is simply a notational technique derived from\ncomputer science that provides a recursive definition of the formulas\ndeemed grammatically \u201ccorrect\u201d, i.e., the set of\nwell-formed formulas: \n\\[\\varphi::=p \\mid \\neg\\varphi\\mid (\\varphi\\wedge\\varphi)\\mid K_{a}\\varphi\\mid B_{a}\\varphi,\\text{ for } p\\in\\Atom.\\]\n\n\nIt should be noted that the Greek letter \\(\\varphi\\) stands for the\nsyntactic category of formula. So this definition says: an\natom p is a formula; \\(\\neg\\varphi\\) is a formula if\n\\(\\varphi\\) is a formula (read \\(\\neg\\) as \u2018it is not the case\nthat\u2019); \\((\\varphi\\wedge\\varphi)\\) is a formula whenever any two\nformulas are connected by the \\(\\wedge\\) symbol (read \\(\\wedge\\) as\n\u2018and\u2019); and \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) and \\(B_{a}\\varphi\\) are\nformulas whenever \\(\\varphi\\) is a formula (the readings were\nindicated above). Note that in a non-BNF recursive specification of\nthe language, the Greek variable \\(\\varphi\\) would be used a\nmetavariable ranging over formulas, and one would normally\nstate the clause for conjunctions as: \\((\\varphi \\wedge \\psi)\\) is a\nformula whenever \\(\\varphi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are formulas. But the BNF\nlet\u2019s us get away with just using \\(\\varphi\\) to get the same\neffect.\n\nWe will call this basic language that includes both a Knowledge\nand a Belief operator, \\(\\mathcal{L}_{KB}\\). As in\npropositional logic, additional connectives are defined from \\(\\neg\\)\nand \\(\\wedge\\): Typical notation is \u2018\\(\\vee\\)\u2019 for\n\u2018or\u2019, \u2018\\(\\rightarrow\\)\u2019 for \u2018if\u2026,\nthen \u2026\u2019 and \u2018\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)\u2019 for\n\u2018\u2026 if, and only if, \u2026\u2019. Also typically\n\\(\\top\\) (\u2018top\u2019) and \\(\\bot\\) (\u2018bottom\u2019) is\nused to denote the constantly true proposition and the constantly\nfalse proposition, respectively.\n\nAs we shall see below, \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) is read as stating that\n\\(\\varphi\\) holds in all of the worlds accessible to\na. In this sense, K can be regarded as behaving\nsimilarly to the \u2018box\u2019 operator, \\(\\square\\), often used\nto denote necessity. In evaluating \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) at a possible\nworld w, one is in effect evaluating a universal\nquantification over all the worlds accessible from w. The\nuniversal quantifier \\(\\forall\\) in first-order logic has the\nexistential quantifier \\(\\exists\\) as its dual: This means\nthat the quantifiers are mutually definable by taking either\n\\(\\forall\\) as primitive and defining \\(\\exists x\\varphi\\) as short\nfor \\(\\neg\\forall x\\neg\\varphi\\) or by taking \\(\\exists\\) as primitive\nand defining \\(\\forall x\\varphi\\) as \\(\\neg\\exists x\\neg\\varphi\\). In\nthe case of \\(K_{a}\\), it may be seen that the formula \\(\\neg\nK_{a}\\neg\\varphi\\) makes an existential quantification: It\nsays that there exists an accessible world that satisfies\n\\(\\varphi\\). In the literature, a dual operator for \\(K_{a}\\) is often\nintroduced. The typical notation for \\(\\neg K_{a}\\neg\\) includes\n\\(\\langle K_{a}\\rangle\\) and \\(\\widehat{K}_{a}\\). This notation mimics\nthe diamond-shape \\(\\lozenge\\), which is the standard dual operator to\nthe box \\(\\square\\), which in turn is standard notation for the\nuniversally quantifying modal operator (see the entry on\n modal logic).\n\nMore expressive languages in epistemic logic involve the addition of\noperators for various notions of group knowledge (see\n Section 3).\n For example, as we discuss below, the common knowledge\noperator and so-called dynamic operators are important\nadditions to the language of epistemic logic. Dynamic operators can\nindicate for example the truthful public announcement of\n\\(\\varphi\\): \\([\\varphi!]\\). A formula \\([\\varphi!]\\psi\\) is read\n\u201cif \\(\\varphi\\) is truthfully announced to everybody, then after\nthe announcement, \\(\\psi\\) is the case\u201d. The question of what\nkinds of expressive power is added with the addition of operators is a\nresearch topic that is actively being investigated in\n dynamic epistemic logic.\n So, for example, adding \\([\\varphi!]\\) by itself to\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{KB}\\) does not add expressive power, but in a\nlanguage that also includes common knowledge, it does (e.g., van\nDitmarsch, van der Hoek, & Kooi 2007).\n",
