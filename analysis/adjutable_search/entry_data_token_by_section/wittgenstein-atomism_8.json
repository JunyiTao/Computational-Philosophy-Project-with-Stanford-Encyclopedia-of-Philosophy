    "main_text": "The Dismantling of Logical Atomism || First phase: The colour-exclusion problem\n5.1 First phase: The colour-exclusion problem\n\nThe so-called \u201ccolour-exclusion problem\u201d is a difficulty\nthat arises for the Tractatus\u2019s view that it is\nmetaphysically possible for each elementary proposition to be true or\nfalse regardless of the truth or falsity of the others (4.211). In\nview of its generality, the problem might more accurately be termed\n\u201cthe problem of the manifest incompatibility of apparently\nunanalysable statements.\u201d The problem may be illustrated as\nfollows: Suppose that a is a point in the visual field.\nConsider the propositions P: \u201ca is blue at\nt\u201d and Q: \u201ca is red at\nt\u201d (supposing \u201cred\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d\nto refer to determinate shades). It is clear that P and\nQ cannot both be true; and yet, on the face of it, it seems\nthat this incompatibility (or \u201cexclusion\u201d in\nWittgenstein\u2019s parlance) is not a logical\nimpossibility. In the Tractatus Wittgenstein\u2019s\nresponse was to treat the problem as merely apparent. He supposed that\nin such cases further analysis would reveal the incompatibility to be\nlogical in nature:\n\nFor two colours, e.g., to be at one place in the visual field\nis impossible, and indeed logically impossible, for it is excluded by\nthe logical structure of colour. Let us consider how this\ncontradiction presents itself in physics. Somewhat as follows: That a\nparticle cannot at the same time have two velocities, that is, that at\nthe same time it cannot be in two places, that is, that particles in\ndifferent places at the same time cannot be identical (6.3751)\n\n\nAs F. P. Ramsey observes in his review of the Tractatus\n(Ramsey, 1923), the analysis described here actually fails to\nreveal a logical incompatibility between the two statements in\nquestion; for, even granting the correctness of the envisaged\nreduction of the phenomenology of colour perception to facts about the\nvelocities of particles, the fact that one and the same particle\ncannot be (wholly) in two places at the same time still looks very\nmuch like a synthetic a priori truth. It turns out, however,\nthat Wittgenstein was well aware of this point. He knew that he had\nnot taken the analysis far enough to bring out a logical\ncontradiction, but he was confident that he had taken a step in the\nright direction. In a Notebooks entry from August 1916 he\nremarks that: \u201cThe fact that a particle cannot be in two places\nat the same time does look more like a logical impossibility\n[than the fact that a point cannot be red and green at the same time].\nIf we ask why, for example, then straight away comes the thought:\nWell, we should call particles that were in two places [at the same\ntime] different, and this in its turn all seems to follow from the\nstructure of space and particles\u201d (NB, 81; emphasis\nadded). Here Wittgenstein is conjecturing that it will turn\nout to be a conceptual (hence, for him logical) truth about\nparticles and space (and presumably also time) that particles in two\ndistinct places (at the same time) are distinct. He does not yet\npossess the requisite analyses to demonstrate this conjecture, but he\nis optimistic that they will be found. \n\nThe article \u201cSome Remarks on Logical Form\u201d (1929) marks\nthe end of this optimism. Wittgenstein now arrives at the view that\nsome incompatibilities cannot, after all, be reduced to logical\nimpossibilities. His change of heart appears to have been occasioned\nby a consideration of incompatibilities involving the attribution of\nqualities that admit of gradation \u2014 e.g., the pitch of\na tone, the brightness of a shade of colour, etc. Consider, for\nexample, the statements: \u201cA has exactly one degree of\nbrightness\u201d and \u201cA has exactly two degrees of\nbrightness.\u201d The challenge is to provide analyses of these\nstatements that bring out the logical impossibility of their being\ntrue together. What Wittgenstein takes to be the most plausible\nsuggestion \u2014 or at least a sympathetic reconstruction of it\n\u2014 adapts the standard definitions of the numerically definite\nquantifiers to the system described in the Tractatus,\nanalysing these claims as respectively:\n\u201c\u2203x(Bx & A has x)\n& ~\u2203x,y(Bx & By\n& A has x and A has y)\u201d\n(\u201cBx\u201d means \u201cx is a degree of\nbrightness\u201d) and \u201c\u2203x,y(Bx\n& By & A has x and A has\ny) & ~\u2203x,y,z(Bx\n& By & Bz & A has x\n& A has y & A has\nz).\u201d But the suggestion will not do. The trouble is\nthat this analysis \u2014 absurdly \u2014 makes it seem as though\nwhen something has just one degree of brightness there could be a\nsubstantive question about which (if any) of the three mentioned in\nthe analysis of the second claim\u2014 x or y or\nz \u2014 it was\u2014as if a degree of brightness were a\nkind of corpuscle whose association with a thing made it bright (cf.\nKlagge and Nordmann, 33). Wittgenstein concludes that the independence\nof elementary propositions must be abandoned and that terms for real\nnumbers must enter into atomic propositions, so that the impossibility\nof something\u2019s having both exactly one and exactly two degrees\nof brightness emerges as an irreducibly mathematical impossibility.\nThis, in turn, contradicts the Tractatus\u2019s idea that\nall necessity is logical necessity (6.37). \n",
