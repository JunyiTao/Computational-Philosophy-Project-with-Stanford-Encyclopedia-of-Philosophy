    "main_text": "Justification\n3. Justification\n\nThe task of defending civil disobedience is commonly undertaken with\nthe assumption that in reasonably just, liberal societies people have\na general moral duty to follow the law (often called political\nobligation). It is on the basis of such an assumption that civil\ndisobedience requires justification. This section examines common\nunderstandings of the problem of disobedience (3.1), before presenting\nprominent accounts and critiques of the conditions under which civil\ndisobedience may be justified (3.2). Whether or not theorists assume\nthat civil disobedience is presumptively impermissible and in need of\njustification, their analyses also articulate the value and role of\ncivil disobedience in non-ideal, nearly just or less-than-nearly-just\nliberal democracies (3.3).\n",
