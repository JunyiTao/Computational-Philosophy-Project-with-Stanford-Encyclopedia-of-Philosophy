Introduction\n\nAristotle\u2019s logical works contain the earliest formal study of\nlogic that we have. It is therefore all the more remarkable that\ntogether they comprise a highly developed logical theory, one that was\nable to command immense respect for many centuries: Kant, who was ten\ntimes more distant from Aristotle than we are from him, even held that\nnothing significant had been added to Aristotle\u2019s views in the\nintervening two millennia.\n\nIn the last century, Aristotle\u2019s reputation as a logician has\nundergone two remarkable reversals. The rise of modern formal logic\nfollowing the work of Frege and Russell brought with it a recognition\nof the many serious limitations of Aristotle\u2019s logic; today,\nvery few would try to maintain that it is adequate as a basis for\nunderstanding science, mathematics, or even everyday reasoning. At the\nsame time, scholars trained in modern formal techniques have come to\nview Aristotle with new respect, not so much for the correctness of\nhis results as for the remarkable similarity in spirit between much of\nhis work and modern logic. As Jonathan Lear has put it,\n\u201cAristotle shares with modern logicians a fundamental interest\nin metatheory\u201d: his primary goal is not to offer a practical\nguide to argumentation but to study the properties of inferential\nsystems themselves.\n2. Aristotle\u2019s Logical Works: The Organon\n\nThe ancient commentators grouped together several of Aristotle\u2019s\ntreatises under the title Organon (\u201cInstrument\u201d)\nand regarded them as comprising his logical works:\n\nCategories\nOn Interpretation\nPrior Analytics\nPosterior Analytics\nTopics\nOn Sophistical Refutations\n\n\nIn fact, the title Organon reflects a much later controversy\nabout whether logic is a part of philosophy (as the Stoics maintained)\nor merely a tool used by philosophy (as the later Peripatetics\nthought); calling the logical works \u201cThe Instrument\u201d is a\nway of taking sides on this point. Aristotle himself never uses this\nterm, nor does he give much indication that these particular treatises\nform some kind of group, though there are frequent cross-references\nbetween the Topics and the Analytics. On the other\nhand, Aristotle treats the Prior and Posterior\nAnalytics as one work, and On Sophistical Refutations is\na final section, or an appendix, to the Topics). To these\nworks should be added the Rhetoric, which explicitly declares\nits reliance on the Topics.\n3. The Subject of Logic: \u201cSyllogisms\u201d\n\nAll Aristotle\u2019s logic revolves around one notion: the\ndeduction (sullogismos). A thorough\nexplanation of what a deduction is, and what they are composed of,\nwill necessarily lead us through the whole of his theory. What, then,\nis a deduction? Aristotle says:\n\nA deduction is speech (logos) in which, certain things having\nbeen supposed, something different from those supposed results of\nnecessity because of their being so. (Prior Analytics I.2,\n24b18\u201320)\n\n\nEach of the \u201cthings supposed\u201d is a\npremise (protasis) of the argument, and what\n\u201cresults of necessity\u201d is the conclusion\n(sumperasma).\n\nThe core of this definition is the notion of \u201cresulting of\nnecessity\u201d (ex anank\u00eas sumbainein). This\ncorresponds to a modern notion of logical consequence: \\(X\\) results\nof necessity from \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) if it would be impossible for \\(X\\)\nto be false when \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) are true. We could therefore take\nthis to be a general definition of \u201cvalid argument\u201d.\n3.1 Induction and Deduction\n\nDeductions are one of two species of argument recognized by Aristotle.\nThe other species is induction\n(epag\u00f4g\u00ea). He has far less to say about this than\ndeduction, doing little more than characterize it as \u201cargument\nfrom the particular to the universal\u201d. However, induction (or\nsomething very much like it) plays a crucial role in the theory of\nscientific knowledge in the Posterior Analytics: it is\ninduction, or at any rate a cognitive process that moves from\nparticulars to their generalizations, that is the basis of knowledge\nof the indemonstrable first principles of sciences.\n3.2 Aristotelian Deductions and Modern Valid Arguments\n\nDespite its wide generality, Aristotle\u2019s definition of deduction\nis not a precise match for a modern definition of validity. Some of\nthe differences may have important consequences:\n\nAristotle explicitly says that what results of necessity must be\ndifferent from what is supposed. This would rule out arguments in\nwhich the conclusion is identical to one of the premises. Modern\nnotions of validity regard such arguments as valid, though trivially\nso.\nThe plural \u201ccertain things having been supposed\u201d was\ntaken by some ancient commentators to rule out by definition arguments\nwith only one premise, and Aristotle himself says in some places that\nnothing new follows from just one premise.\nThe force of the qualification \u201cbecause of their being\nso\u201d has sometimes been seen as ruling out arguments in which the\nconclusion is not \u2018relevant\u2019 to the premises, e.g.,\narguments in which the premises are inconsistent, arguments with\nconclusions that would follow from any premises whatsoever, or\narguments with superfluous premises.\n\n\nOf these three possible restrictions, the most interesting would be\nthe third. This could be (and has been) interpreted as committing\nAristotle to something like a\n relevance logic.\n In fact, there are passages that appear to confirm this. However,\nthis is too complex a matter to discuss here.\n\nHowever the definition is interpreted, it is clear that Aristotle does\nnot mean to restrict it only to a subset of the valid arguments. This\nis why I have translated sullogismos with\n\u2018deduction\u2019 rather than its English cognate. In modern\nusage, \u2018syllogism\u2019 means an argument of a very specific\nform. Moreover, modern usage distinguishes between valid syllogisms\n(the conclusions of which follow from their premises) and invalid\nsyllogisms (the conclusions of which do not follow from their\npremises). The second of these is inconsistent with Aristotle\u2019s\nuse: since he defines a sullogismos as an argument in which\nthe conclusion results of necessity from the premises, \u201cinvalid\nsullogismos\u201d is a contradiction in terms. The first is\nalso at least highly misleading, since Aristotle does not appear to\nthink that the sullogismoi are simply an interesting subset\nof the valid arguments. Moreover (see below), Aristotle expends great\nefforts to argue that every valid argument, in a broad sense, can be\n\u201creduced\u201d to an argument, or series of arguments, in\nsomething like one of the forms traditionally called a syllogism. If\nwe translate sullogismos as \u201csyllogism\u201d, this\nbecomes the trivial claim \u201cEvery syllogism is a\nsyllogism\u201d,\n4. Premises: The Structures of Assertions\n\nSyllogisms are structures of sentences each of which can meaningfully\nbe called true or false: assertions\n(apophanseis), in Aristotle\u2019s terminology. According to\nAristotle, every such sentence must have the same structure: it must\ncontain a subject (hupokeimenon) and a\npredicate and must either affirm or deny the\npredicate of the subject. Thus, every assertion is either the\naffirmation kataphasis or the\ndenial (apophasis) of a single predicate of\na single subject.\n\nIn On Interpretation, Aristotle argues that a single\nassertion must always either affirm or deny a single predicate of a\nsingle subject. Thus, he does not recognize sentential compounds, such\nas conjunctions and disjunctions, as single assertions. This appears\nto be a deliberate choice on his part: he argues, for instance, that a\nconjunction is simply a collection of assertions, with no more\nintrinsic unity than the sequence of sentences in a lengthy account\n(e.g. the entire Iliad, to take Aristotle\u2019s own\nexample). Since he also treats denials as one of the two basic species\nof assertion, he does not view negations as sentential compounds. His\ntreatment of conditional sentences and disjunctions is more difficult\nto appraise, but it is at any rate clear that Aristotle made no\nefforts to develop a sentential logic. Some of the consequences of\nthis for his theory of demonstration are important.\n4.1 Terms\n\nSubjects and predicates of assertions are terms. A\nterm (horos) can be either individual, e.g.\nSocrates, Plato or universal, e.g. human,\nhorse, animal, white. Subjects may be\neither individual or universal, but predicates can only be universals:\nSocrates is human, Plato is not a horse, horses\nare animals, humans are not horses.\n\nThe word universal (katholou) appears to be\nan Aristotelian coinage. Literally, it means \u201cof a whole\u201d;\nits opposite is therefore \u201cof a particular\u201d\n(kath\u2019 hekaston). Universal terms are those which can\nproperly serve as predicates, while particular terms are those which\ncannot.\n\nThis distinction is not simply a matter of grammatical function. We\ncan readily enough construct a sentence with \u201cSocrates\u201d as\nits grammatical predicate: \u201cThe person sitting down is\nSocrates\u201d. Aristotle, however, does not consider this a genuine\npredication. He calls it instead a merely accidental\nor incidental (kata sumbeb\u00eakos)\npredication. Such sentences are, for him, dependent for their truth\nvalues on other genuine predications (in this case, \u201cSocrates is\nsitting down\u201d).\n\nConsequently, predication for Aristotle is as much a matter of\nmetaphysics as a matter of grammar. The reason that the term\nSocrates is an individual term and not a universal is that\nthe entity which it designates is an individual, not a universal. What\nmakes white and human universal terms is that they\ndesignate universals.\n\nFurther discussion of these issues can be found in the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics.\n4.2 Affirmations, Denials, and Contradictions\n\nAristotle takes some pains in On Interpretation to argue that\nto every affirmation there corresponds exactly one denial such that\nthat denial denies exactly what that affirmation affirms. The pair\nconsisting of an affirmation and its corresponding denial is a\ncontradiction (antiphasis). In general,\nAristotle holds, exactly one member of any contradiction is true and\none false: they cannot both be true, and they cannot both be false.\nHowever, he appears to make an exception for propositions about future\nevents, though interpreters have debated extensively what this\nexception might be (see\n further discussion\n below). The principle that contradictories cannot both be true has\nfundamental importance in Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics (see\n further discussion\n below).\n4.3 All, Some, and None\n\nOne major difference between Aristotle\u2019s understanding of\npredication and modern (i.e., post-Fregean) logic is that Aristotle\ntreats individual predications and general predications as similar in\nlogical form: he gives the same analysis to \u201cSocrates is an\nanimal\u201d and \u201cHumans are animals\u201d. However, he notes\nthat when the subject is a universal, predication takes on two forms:\nit can be either universal or\nparticular. These expressions are parallel to those\nwith which Aristotle distinguishes universal and particular terms, and\nAristotle is aware of that, explicitly distinguishing between a term\nbeing a universal and a term being universally predicated of\nanother.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAffirmations\nDenials \n\nUniversal\n\\(P\\) affirmed of all of \\(S\\)\nEvery \\(S\\) is \\(P\\),\n\nAll \\(S\\) is (are) \\(P\\)\n\\(P\\) denied of all of \\(S\\)\nNo \\(S\\) is \\(P\\) \n\nParticular\n\\(P\\) affirmed of some of \\(S\\)\nSome \\(S\\) is (are) \\(P\\)\n\\(P\\) denied of some of \\(S\\)\nSome \\(S\\) is not \\(P\\),\n\nNot every \\(S\\) is \\(P\\) \n\nIndefinite\n\\(P\\) affirmed of \\(S\\)\n\\(S\\) is \\(P\\)\n\\(P\\) denied of \\(S\\)\n\\(S\\) is not \\(P\\)  \n\n\nWhatever is affirmed or denied of a universal subject may be affirmed\nor denied of it it universally (katholou or\n\u201cof all\u201d, kata pantos), in part\n(kata meros, en merei), or\nindefinitely (adihoristos).\n4.3.1 The \u201cSquare of Opposition\u201d\n\nIn On Interpretation, Aristotle spells out the relationships\nof contradiction for sentences with universal subjects as follows:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAffirmation\nDenial \n\nUniversal\nEvery \\(A\\) is \\(B\\)\nNo \\(A\\) is \\(B\\) \n\nParticular\nSome \\(A\\) is \\(B\\)\nNot every \\(A\\) is \\(B\\)  \n\n\nSimple as it appears, this table raises important difficulties of\ninterpretation (for a thorough discussion, see the entry on the\n square of opposition).\n\nIn the Prior Analytics, Aristotle adopts a somewhat\nartificial way of expressing predications: instead of saying\n\u201c\\(X\\) is predicated of \\(Y\\)\u201d he says \u201c\\(X\\)\nbelongs (huparchei) to \\(Y\\)\u201d. This should really be\nregarded as a technical expression. The verb huparchein\nusually means either \u201cbegin\u201d or \u201cexist, be\npresent\u201d, and Aristotle\u2019s usage appears to be a\ndevelopment of this latter use.\n4.3.2 Some Convenient Abbreviations\n\nFor clarity and brevity, I will use the following semi-traditional\nabbreviations for Aristotelian categorical sentences (note that the\npredicate term comes first and the subject term\nsecond):\n\n\n\nAbbreviation\nSentence \n\n\\(Aab\\)\n\\(a\\) belongs to all \\(b\\) (Every \\(b\\) is \\(a\\)) \n\n\\(Eab\\)\n\\(a\\) belongs to no \\(b\\) (No \\(b\\) is \\(a\\)) \n\n\\(Iab\\)\n\\(a\\) belongs to some \\(b\\) (Some \\(b\\) is \\(a\\)) \n\n\\(Oab\\)\n\\(a\\) does not belong to all \\(b\\) (Some \\(b\\) is not\n\\(a\\))  \n\n5. The Syllogistic\n\nAristotle\u2019s most famous achievement as logician is his theory of\ninference, traditionally called the syllogistic\n(though not by Aristotle). That theory is in fact the theory of\ninferences of a very specific sort: inferences with two premises, each\nof which is a categorical sentence, having exactly one term in common,\nand having as conclusion a categorical sentence the terms of which are\njust those two terms not shared by the premises. Aristotle calls the\nterm shared by the premises the middle term\n(meson) and each of the other two terms in the premises an\nextreme (akron). The middle term must be\neither subject or predicate of each premise, and this can occur in\nthree ways: the middle term can be the subject of one premise and the\npredicate of the other, the predicate of both premises, or the subject\nof both premises. Aristotle refers to these term arrangements as\nfigures (sch\u00eamata):\n5.1 The Figures\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nFirst Figure\nSecond Figure\nThird Figure \n\n\u00a0\nPredicate\nSubject\nPredicate\nSubject\nPredicate\nSubject \n\nPremise\n\\(a\\)\n\\(b\\)\n\\(a\\)\n\\(b\\)\n\\(a\\)\n\\(c\\) \n\nPremise\n\\(b\\)\n\\(c\\)\n\\(a\\)\n\\(c\\)\n\\(b\\)\n\\(c\\) \n\nConclusion\n\\(a\\)\n\\(c\\)\n\\(b\\)\n\\(c\\)\n\\(a\\)\n\\(b\\)  \n\n\nAristotle calls the term which is the predicate of the conclusion the\nmajor term and the term which is the subject of the\nconclusion the minor term. The premise containing the\nmajor term is the major premise, and the premise\ncontaining the minor term is the minor premise.\n\nAristotle then systematically investigates all possible combinations\nof two premises in each of the three figures. For each combination, he\neither demonstrates that some conclusion necessarily follows or\ndemonstrates that no conclusion follows. The results he states are\ncorrect.\n5.2 Methods of Proof: \u201cPerfect\u201d Deductions, Conversion, Reduction\n\nAristotle\u2019s proofs can be divided into two categories, based on\na distinction he makes between \u201cperfect\u201d or\n\u201ccomplete\u201d (teleios) deductions and\n\u201cimperfect\u201d or \u201cincomplete\u201d\n(atel\u00eas) deductions. A deduction is perfect if it\n\u201cneeds no external term in order to show the necessary\nresult\u201d (24b23\u201324), and it is imperfect if it \u201cneeds\none or several in addition that are necessary because of the terms\nsupposed but were not assumed through premises\u201d\n(24b24\u201325). The precise interpretation of this distinction is\ndebatable, but it is at any rate clear that Aristotle regards the\nperfect deductions as not in need of proof in some sense. For\nimperfect deductions, Aristotle does give proofs, which invariably\ndepend on the perfect deductions. Thus, with some reservations, we\nmight compare the perfect deductions to the axioms or primitive rules\nof a deductive system.\n\nIn the proofs for imperfect deductions, Aristotle says that he\n\u201creduces\u201d (anagein) each case to one of the\nperfect forms and that they are thereby \u201ccompleted\u201d or\n\u201cperfected\u201d. These completions are either\nprobative (deiktikos: a modern translation\nmight be \u201cdirect\u201d) or through the\nimpossible (dia to adunaton).\n\nA direct deduction is a series of steps leading from the premises to\nthe conclusion, each of which is either a conversion\nof a previous step or an inference from two previous steps relying on\na first-figure deduction. Conversion, in turn, is inferring from a\nproposition another which has the subject and predicate interchanged.\nSpecifically, Aristotle argues that three such conversions are\nsound: \n\\[\\begin{align}\nEab &\\rightarrow Eba \\\\\n Iab &\\rightarrow Iba \\\\\n Aab &\\rightarrow Iba \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nHe undertakes to justify these in An. Pr. I.2. From a modern\nstandpoint, the third is sometimes regarded with suspicion. Using it\nwe can get Some monsters are chimeras from the apparently\ntrue All chimeras are monsters; but the former is often\nconstrued as implying in turn There is something which is a\nmonster and a chimera, and thus that there are monsters and there\nare chimeras. In fact, this simply points up something about\nAristotle\u2019s system: Aristotle in effect supposes that\nall terms in syllogisms are non-empty. (For further\ndiscussion of this point, see the entry on the\n square of opposition).\n\nAs an example of the procedure, we may take Aristotle\u2019s proof of\nCamestres. He says:\n\nIf \\(M\\) belongs to every \\(N\\) but to no \\(X\\), then neither will\n\\(N\\) belong to any \\(X\\). For if \\(M\\) belongs to no \\(X\\), then\nneither does \\(X\\) belong to any \\(M\\); but \\(M\\) belonged to every\n\\(N\\); therefore, \\(X\\) will belong to no \\(N\\) (for the first figure\nhas come about). And since the privative converts, neither will \\(N\\)\nbelong to any \\(X\\). (An. Pr. I.5, 27a9\u201312)\n\n\nFrom this text, we can extract an exact formal proof, as follows:\n\n\n\nStep\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nJustification\nAristotle\u2019s Text \n\n1. \\(MaN\\)\n\u00a0\nIf \\(M\\) belongs to every \\(N\\) \n\n2. \\(MeX\\)\n\u00a0\nbut to no \\(X\\), \n\nTo prove:\n\n\\(NeX\\)\n\u00a0\nthen neither will \\(N\\) belong to any \\(X\\). \n\n3. \\(MeX\\)\n(2, premise)\nFor if \\(M\\) belongs to no \\(X\\), \n\n4. \\(XeM\\)\n(3, conversion of \\(e\\))\nthen neither does \\(X\\) belong to any \\(M\\); \n\n5. \\(MaN\\)\n(1, premise)\nbut \\(M\\) belonged to every \\(N\\); \n\n6. \\(XeN\\)\n(4, 5, Celarent)\ntherefore, \\(X\\) will belong to no \\(N\\) (for the first\nfigure has come about). \n\n7. \\(NeX\\)\n(6, conversion of \\(e\\))\nAnd since the privative converts, neither will \\(N\\) belong\nto any \\(X\\).  \n\n\nA completion or proof \u201cthrough the impossible\u201d shows that\na certain conclusion follows from a pair of premises by assuming as a\nthird premise the denial of that conclusion and giving a deduction,\nfrom it and one of the original premises, the denial (or the contrary)\nof the other premises. This is the deduction of an\n\u201cimpossible\u201d, and Aristotle\u2019s proof ends at that\npoint. An example is his proof of Baroco in\n27a36\u2013b1:\n\n\n\nStep\nJustification\nAristotle\u2019s Text \n\n1. \\(MaN\\)\n\u00a0\nNext, if \\(M\\) belongs to every \\(N\\), \n\n2. \\(MoX\\)\n\u00a0\nbut does not belong to some \\(X\\), \n\nTo prove: \\(NoX\\)\n\u00a0\nthen it is necessary for \\(N\\) not to belong to some\n\\(X\\) \n\n3. \\(NaX\\)\nContradictory of the desired conclusion\nFor if it belongs to all, \n\n4. \\(MaN\\)\nRepetition of premise 1\nand \\(M\\) is predicated of every \\(N\\), \n\n5. \\(MaX\\)\n(3, 4, Barbara)\nthen it is necessary that \\(M\\) belongs to every\n\\(X\\). \n\n6. \\(MoX\\)\n(5 is the contradictory of 2)\nBut it was assumed not to belong to some. \n\n\n5.3 Disproof: Counterexamples and Terms\n\nAristotle proves invalidity by constructing counterexamples. This is\nvery much in the spirit of modern logical theory: all that it takes to\nshow that a certain form is invalid is a single\ninstance of that form with true premises and a false\nconclusion. However, Aristotle states his results not by saying that\ncertain premise-conclusion combinations are invalid but by saying that\ncertain premise pairs do not \u201csyllogize\u201d: that is, that,\ngiven the pair in question, examples can be constructed in which\npremises of that form are true and a conclusion of any of the four\npossible forms is false.\n\nWhen possible, he does this by a clever and economical method: he\ngives two triplets of terms, one of which makes the premises true and\na universal affirmative \u201cconclusion\u201d true, and the other\nof which makes the premises true and a universal negative\n\u201cconclusion\u201d true. The first is a counterexample for an\nargument with either an \\(E\\) or an \\(O\\) conclusion, and the second\nis a counterexample for an argument with either an \\(A\\) or an \\(I\\)\nconclusion.\n5.4 The Deductions in the Figures (\u201cMoods\u201d)\n\nIn Prior Analytics I.4\u20136, Aristotle shows that the\npremise combinations given in the following table yield deductions and\nthat all other premise combinations fail to yield a deduction. In the\nterminology traditional since the middle ages, each of these\ncombinations is known as a mood Latin modus,\n\u201cway\u201d, which in turn is a translation of Greek\ntropos). Aristotle, however, does not use this expression and\ninstead refers to \u201cthe arguments in the figures\u201d.\n\nIn this table, \u201c\\(\\vdash\\)\u201d separates premises from\nconclusion; it may be read \u201ctherefore\u201d. The second column\nlists the medieval mnemonic name associated with the inference (these\nare still widely used, and each is actually a mnemonic for\nAristotle\u2019s proof of the mood in question). The third column\nbriefly summarizes Aristotle\u2019s procedure for demonstrating the\ndeduction.\n\n\n\n\nForm\nMnemonic\nProof \n\n\n\nFIRST FIGURE \n\n\\(Aab, Abc \\vdash Aac\\)\nBarbara\nPerfect \n\n\\(Eab, Abc \\vdash Eac\\)\nCelarent\nPerfect \n\n\\(Aab, Ibc \\vdash Iac\\)\nDarii\nPerfect; also by impossibility, from Camestres\n\n\n\\(Eab, Ibc \\vdash Oac\\)\nFerio\nPerfect; also by impossibility, from Cesare \n\n\n\nSECOND FIGURE \n\n\\(Eab, Aac \\vdash Ebc\\)\nCesare\n\\((Eab, Aac)\\rightarrow (Eba, Aac)\\) \\(\\vdash_{Cel} Ebc\\)\n\n\n\\(Aab, Eac \\vdash Ebc\\)\nCamestres\n\\((Aab, Eac) \\rightarrow (Aab, Eca)= (Eca, Aab)\\) \\(\\vdash_{Cel}\nEcb \\rightarrow Ebc\\) \n\n\\(Eab, Iac \\vdash Obc\\)\nFestino\n\\((Eab, Iac) \\rightarrow (Eba,Iac)\\) \\(\\vdash_{Fer} Obc\\)\n\n\n\\(Aab, Oac \\vdash Obc\\)\nBaroco\n\\((Aab, Oac +Abc) \\vdash_{Bar} (Aac,Oac)\\) \\(\\vdash_{Imp}\nObc\\) \n\n\n\nTHIRD FIGURE \n\n\\(Aac, Abc \\vdash Iab\\)\nDarapti\n\\((Aac, Abc) \\rightarrow (Aac,Icb)\\) \\(\\vdash_{Dar} Iab\\)\n\n\n\\(Eac, Abc \\vdash Oab\\)\nFelapton\n\\((Eac, Abc) \\rightarrow (Eac,Icb)\\) \\(\\vdash_{Fer} Oab\\)\n\n\n\\(Iac, Abc \\vdash Iab\\)\nDisamis\n\\((Iac, Abc) \\rightarrow (Ica, Abc)=(Abc,Ica)\\) \\(\\vdash_{Dar}\nIba \\rightarrow Iab\\) \n\n\\(Aac, Ibc \\vdash Iab\\)\nDatisi\n\\((Aac, Ibc) \\rightarrow (Aac,Icb)\\) \\(\\vdash_{Dar} Iab\\)\n\n\n\\(Oac, Abc \\vdash Oab\\)\nBocardo\n\\((Oac, +Aab, Abc) \\vdash_{Bar} (Aac,Oac)\\) \\(\\vdash_{Imp}\nOab\\) \n\n\\(Eac, Ibc \\vdash Oab\\)\nFerison\n\\((Eac, Ibc) \\rightarrow (Eac, Icb)\\) \\(\\vdash_{Fer} Oab\\)\n \n\n\nTable of the Deductions in the Figures\n\n5.5 Metatheoretical Results\n\nHaving established which deductions in the figures are possible,\nAristotle draws a number of metatheoretical conclusions,\nincluding:\n\nNo deduction has two negative premises\nNo deduction has two particular premises\nA deduction with an affirmative conclusion must have two\naffirmative premises\nA deduction with a negative conclusion must have one negative\npremise.\nA deduction with a universal conclusion must have two universal\npremises\n\n\nHe also proves the following metatheorem:\n\nAll deductions can be reduced to the two universal deductions in the\nfirst figure.\n\n\nHis proof of this is elegant. First, he shows that the two particular\ndeductions of the first figure can be reduced, by proof through\nimpossibility, to the universal deductions in the second figure:\n\n(Darii)\n\\((Aab, Ibc, +Eac)\\vdash_{Camestres} (Ebc, Ibc)\\vdash_{Imp}\nIac\\)\n(Ferio)\n\\((Eab, Ibc, +Aac)\\vdash_{Cesare} (Ebc, Ibc)\\vdash_{Imp}\nOac\\)\n\n\nHe then observes that since he has already shown how to reduce all the\nparticular deductions in the other figures except Baroco and\nBocardo to Darii and Ferio, these\ndeductions can thus be reduced to Barbara and\nCelarent. This proof is strikingly similar both in structure\nand in subject to modern proofs of the redundancy of axioms in a\nsystem.\n\nMany more metatheoretical results, some of them quite sophisticated,\nare proved in Prior Analytics I.45 and in Prior\nAnalytics II. As noted below, some of Aristotle\u2019s\nmetatheoretical results are appealed to in the epistemological\narguments of the Posterior Analytics.\n5.6 Syllogisms with Modalities\n\nAristotle follows his treatment of \u201carguments in the\nfigures\u201d with a much longer, and much more problematic,\ndiscussion of what happens to these figured arguments when we add the\nqualifications \u201cnecessarily\u201d and \u201cpossibly\u201d to\ntheir premises in various ways. In contrast to the syllogistic itself\n(or, as commentators like to call it, the assertoric\nsyllogistic), this modal syllogistic appears to be much less\nsatisfactory and is certainly far more difficult to interpret. Here, I\nonly outline Aristotle\u2019s treatment of this subject and note some\nof the principal points of interpretive controversy.\n5.6.1 The Definitions of the Modalities\n\nModern modal logic treats necessity and possibility as interdefinable:\n\u201cnecessarily P\u201d is equivalent to \u201cnot possibly not\nP\u201d, and \u201cpossibly P\u201d to \u201cnot necessarily not\nP\u201d. Aristotle gives these same equivalences in On\nInterpretation. However, in Prior Analytics, he makes a\ndistinction between two notions of possibility. On the first, which he\ntakes as his preferred notion, \u201cpossibly P\u201d is equivalent\nto \u201cnot necessarily P and not necessarily not P\u201d. He then\nacknowledges an alternative definition of possibility according to the\nmodern equivalence, but this plays only a secondary role in his\nsystem.\n5.6.2 Aristotle\u2019s General Approach\n\nAristotle builds his treatment of modal syllogisms on his account of\nnon-modal (assertoric) syllogisms: he works his way\nthrough the syllogisms he has already proved and considers the\nconsequences of adding a modal qualification to one or both premises.\nMost often, then, the questions he explores have the form: \u201cHere\nis an assertoric syllogism; if I add these modal qualifications to the\npremises, then what modally qualified form of the conclusion (if any)\nfollows?\u201d. A premise can have one of three modalities: it can be\nnecessary, possible, or assertoric. Aristotle works through the\ncombinations of these in order:\n\nTwo necessary premises\nOne necessary and one assertoric premise\nTwo possible premises\nOne assertoric and one possible premise\nOne necessary and one possible premise\n\n\nThough he generally considers only premise combinations which\nsyllogize in their assertoric forms, he does sometimes extend this;\nsimilarly, he sometimes considers conclusions in addition to those\nwhich would follow from purely assertoric premises.\n\nSince this is his procedure, it is convenient to describe modal\nsyllogisms in terms of the corresponding non-modal syllogism plus a\ntriplet of letters indicating the modalities of premises and\nconclusion: \\(N\\) = \u201cnecessary\u201d, \\(P\\) =\n\u201cpossible\u201d, \\(A\\) = \u201cassertoric\u201d. Thus,\n\u201cBarbara \\(NAN\\)\u201d would mean \u201cThe form\nBarbara with necessary major premise, assertoric minor\npremise, and necessary conclusion\u201d. I use the letters\n\u201c\\(N\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(P\\)\u201d as prefixes for premises\nas well; a premise with no prefix is assertoric. Thus,\nBarbara \\(NAN\\) would be \\(NAab, Abc \\vdash NAac\\).\n5.6.3 Modal Conversions\n\nAs in the case of assertoric syllogisms, Aristotle makes use of\nconversion rules to prove validity. The conversion rules for necessary\npremises are exactly analogous to those for assertoric premises:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nNEab &\\rightarrow NEba \\\\\n NIab &\\rightarrow NIba \\\\\n NAab &\\rightarrow NIba \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nPossible premises behave differently, however. Since he defines\n\u201cpossible\u201d as \u201cneither necessary nor\nimpossible\u201d, it turns out that \\(x\\) is possibly \\(F\\)\nentails, and is entailed by, \\(x\\) is possibly not \\(F\\).\nAristotle generalizes this to the case of categorical sentences as\nfollows: \n\\[\\begin{align}\nPAab &\\rightarrow PEab \\\\\n PEab &\\rightarrow PAab \\\\\n PIab &\\rightarrow POab \\\\\n POab &\\rightarrow PIab \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nIn addition, Aristotle uses the intermodal principle \\(N\\rightarrow\nA\\): that is, a necessary premise entails the corresponding assertoric\none. However, because of his definition of possibility, the principle\n\\(A\\rightarrow P\\) does not generally hold: if it did, then\n\\(N\\rightarrow P\\) would hold, but on his definition\n\u201cnecessarily \\(P\\)\u201d and \u201cpossibly \\(P\\)\u201d are\nactually inconsistent (\u201cpossibly \\(P\\)\u201d entails\n\u201cpossibly not \\(P\\)\u201d).\n\nThis leads to a further complication. The denial of \u201cpossibly\n\\(P\\)\u201d for Aristotle is \u201ceither necessarily \\(P\\) or\nnecessarily not \\(P\\)\u201d. The denial of \u201cnecessarily\n\\(P\\)\u201d is still more difficult to express in terms of a\ncombination of modalities: \u201ceither possibly \\(P\\) (and thus\npossibly not \\(P\\)) or necessarily not \\(P\\)\u201d This is important\nbecause of Aristotle\u2019s proof procedures, which include proof\nthrough impossibility. If we give a proof through impossibility in\nwhich we assume a necessary premise, then the conclusion we ultimately\nestablish is simply the denial of that necessary premise, not a\n\u201cpossible\u201d conclusion in Aristotle\u2019s sense. Such\npropositions do occur in his system, but only in exactly this way,\ni.e., as conclusions established by proof through impossiblity from\nnecessary assumptions. Somewhat confusingly, Aristotle calls such\npropositions \u201cpossible\u201d but immediately adds \u201c not\nin the sense defined\u201d: in this sense, \u201cpossibly\n\\(Oab\\)\u201d is simply the denial of \u201cnecessarily\n\\(Aab\\)\u201d. Such propositions appear only as premises, never as\nconclusions.\n5.6.4 Syllogisms with Necessary Premises\n\nAristotle holds that an assertoric syllogism remains valid if\n\u201cnecessarily\u201d is added to its premises and its conclusion:\nthe modal pattern \\(NNN\\) is always valid. He does not treat this as a\ntrivial consequence but instead offers proofs; in all but two cases,\nthese are parallel to those offered for the assertoric case. The\nexceptions are Baroco and Bocardo, which he proved\nin the assertoric case through impossibility: attempting to use that\nmethod here would require him to take the denial of a necessary \\(O\\)\nproposition as hypothesis, raising the complication noted above, and\nhe uses the procedure he calls ecthesis instead (see Smith\n1982).\n5.6.5 The Problem of the \u201cTwo Barbaras\u201d and Other Problems of Interpretation\n\nSince a necessary premise entails an assertoric premise, every \\(AN\\)\nor \\(NA\\) combination of premises will entail the corresponding \\(AA\\)\npair, and thus the corresponding \\(A\\) conclusion. Thus, \\(ANA\\) and\n\\(NAA\\) syllogisms are always valid. However, Aristotle holds that\nsome, but not all, \\(ANN\\) and \\(NAN\\) combinations are valid.\nSpecifically, he accepts Barbara \\(NAN\\) but rejects\nBarbara \\(ANN\\). Almost from Aristotle\u2019s own time,\ninterpreters have found his reasons for this distinction obscure, or\nunpersuasive, or both, and often have not followed his view. His close\nassociated Theophrastus, for instance, adopted the simpler rule that\nthe modality of the conclusion of a syllogism was always the\n\u201cweakest\u201d modality found in either premise, where \\(N\\) is\nstronger than \\(A\\) and \\(A\\) is stronger than \\(P\\) (and where \\(P\\)\nprobably has to be defined as \u201cnot necessarily not\u201d).\n\nBeginning with Albrecht Becker, interpreters using the methods of\nmodern formal logic to interpret Aristotle\u2019s modal logic have\nseen the Two-Barbaras problem as only one of a series of difficulties\nin giving a coherent interpretation of the modal syllogistic. A very\nwide range of reconstructions has been proposed: see Becker 1933,\nMcCall 1963, Nortmann 1996, Van Rijen 1989, Patterson 1995, Thomason\n1993, Thom 1996, Rini 2012, Malink 2013. The majority of\nreconstructions do not attempt to reproduce every detail of\nAristotle\u2019s exposition but instead produce modified\nreconstructions that abandon some of those results. Malink 2013,\nhowever, offers a reconstruction that reproduces everything Aristotle\nsays, although the resulting model introduces a high degree of\ncomplexity. (This subject quickly becomes too complex for summarizing\nin this brief article.\n6. Demonstrations and Demonstrative Sciences\n\nA demonstration (apodeixis) is \u201ca\ndeduction that produces knowledge\u201d. Aristotle\u2019s\nPosterior Analytics contains his account of demonstrations\nand their role in knowledge. From a modern perspective, we might think\nthat this subject moves outside of logic to epistemology. From\nAristotle\u2019s perspective, however, the connection of the theory\nof sullogismoi with the theory of knowledge is especially\nclose.\n6.1 Aristotelian Sciences\n\nThe subject of the Posterior Analytics is\nepist\u00eam\u00ea. This is one of several Greek words that\ncan reasonably be translated \u201cknowledge\u201d, but Aristotle is\nconcerned only with knowledge of a certain type (as will be explained\nbelow). There is a long tradition of translating\nepist\u00eam\u00ea in this technical sense as\nscience, and I shall follow that tradition here.\nHowever, readers should not be misled by the use of that word. In\nparticular, Aristotle\u2019s theory of science cannot be considered a\ncounterpart to modern philosophy of science, at least not without\nsubstantial qualifications.\n\nWe have scientific knowledge, according to Aristotle, when we\nknow:\n\nthe cause why the thing is, that it is the cause of this, and that\nthis cannot be otherwise. (Posterior Analytics I.2)\n\n\nThis implies two strong conditions on what can be the object of\nscientific knowledge:\n\nOnly what is necessarily the case can be known scientifically\nScientific knowledge is knowledge of causes\n\n\nHe then proceeds to consider what science so defined will consist in,\nbeginning with the observation that at any rate one form of science\nconsists in the possession of a demonstration\n(apodeixis), which he defines as a \u201cscientific\ndeduction\u201d:\n\nby \u201cscientific\u201d (epist\u00eamonikon), I mean\nthat in virtue of possessing it, we have knowledge.\n\n\nThe remainder of Posterior Analytics I is largely concerned\nwith two tasks: spelling out the nature of demonstration and\ndemonstrative science and answering an important challenge to its very\npossibility. Aristotle first tells us that a demonstration is a\ndeduction in which the premises are:\n\ntrue\nprimary (prota)\nimmediate (amesa, \u201cwithout a\nmiddle\u201d)\nbetter known or more familiar\n(gn\u00f4rim\u00f4tera) than the conclusion\nprior to the conclusion\ncauses (aitia) of the conclusion\n\n\nThe interpretation of all these conditions except the first has been\nthe subject of much controversy. Aristotle clearly thinks that science\nis knowledge of causes and that in a demonstration, knowledge of the\npremises is what brings about knowledge of the conclusion. The fourth\ncondition shows that the knower of a demonstration must be in some\nbetter epistemic condition towards them, and so modern interpreters\noften suppose that Aristotle has defined a kind of epistemic\njustification here. However, as noted above, Aristotle is defining a\nspecial variety of knowledge. Comparisons with discussions of\njustification in modern epistemology may therefore be misleading.\n\nThe same can be said of the terms \u201cprimary\u201d,\n\u201cimmediate\u201d and \u201cbetter known\u201d. Modern\ninterpreters sometimes take \u201cimmediate\u201d to mean\n\u201cself-evident\u201d; Aristotle does say that an immediate\nproposition is one \u201cto which no other is prior\u201d, but (as I\nsuggest in the next section) the notion of priority involved is likely\na notion of logical priority that it is hard to detach from\nAristotle\u2019s own logical theories. \u201cBetter known\u201d has\nsometimes been interpreted simply as \u201cpreviously known to the\nknower of the demonstration\u201d (i.e., already known in advance of\nthe demonstration). However, Aristotle explicitly distinguishes\nbetween what is \u201cbetter known for us\u201d with what is\n\u201cbetter known in itself\u201d or \u201cin nature\u201d and\nsays that he means the latter in his definition. In fact, he says that\nthe process of acquiring scientific knowledge is a process of\nchanging what is better known \u201cfor us\u201d, until we\narrive at that condition in which what is better known in itself is\nalso better known for us.\n6.2 The Regress Problem\n\nIn Posterior Analytics I.2, Aristotle considers two\nchallenges to the possibility of science. One party (dubbed the\n\u201cagnostics\u201d by Jonathan Barnes) began with the following\ntwo premises:\n\nWhatever is scientifically known must be demonstrated.\nThe premises of a demonstration must be scientifically known.\n\n\nThey then argued that demonstration is impossible with the following\ndilemma:\n\nIf the premises of a demonstration are scientifically known, then\nthey must be demonstrated.\nThe premises from which each premise are demonstrated must be\nscientifically known.\nEither this process continues forever, creating an infinite\nregress of premises, or it comes to a stop at some point.\nIf it continues forever, then there are no first premises from\nwhich the subsequent ones are demonstrated, and so nothing is\ndemonstrated.\nOn the other hand, if it comes to a stop at some point, then the\npremises at which it comes to a stop are undemonstrated and therefore\nnot scientifically known; consequently, neither are any of the others\ndeduced from them.\nTherefore, nothing can be demonstrated.\n\n\nA second group accepted the agnostics\u2019 view that scientific\nknowledge comes only from demonstration but rejected their conclusion\nby rejecting the dilemma. Instead, they maintained:\n\nDemonstration \u201cin a circle\u201d is possible, so that it is\npossible for all premises also to be conclusions and therefore\ndemonstrated.\n\n\nAristotle does not give us much information about how circular\ndemonstration was supposed to work, but the most plausible\ninterpretation would be supposing that at least for some set of\nfundamental principles, each principle could be deduced from the\nothers. (Some modern interpreters have compared this position to a\ncoherence theory of knowledge.) However their position worked, the\ncircular demonstrators claimed to have a third alternative avoiding\nthe agnostics\u2019 dilemma, since circular demonstration gives us a\nregress that is both unending (in the sense that we never reach\npremises at which it comes to a stop) and finite (because it works its\nway round the finite circle of premises).\n6.3 Aristotle\u2019s Solution: \u201cIt Eventually Comes to a Stop\u201d\n\nAristotle rejects circular demonstration as an incoherent notion on\nthe grounds that the premises of any demonstration must be prior (in\nan appropriate sense) to the conclusion, whereas a circular\ndemonstration would make the same premises both prior and posterior to\none another (and indeed every premise prior and posterior to itself).\nHe agrees with the agnostics\u2019 analysis of the regress problem:\nthe only plausible options are that it continues indefinitely or that\nit \u201ccomes to a stop\u201d at some point. However, he thinks\nboth the agnostics and the circular demonstrators are wrong in\nmaintaining that scientific knowledge is only possible by\ndemonstration from premises scientifically known: instead, he claims,\nthere is another form of knowledge possible for the first premises,\nand this provides the starting points for demonstrations.\n\nTo solve this problem, Aristotle needs to do something quite specific.\nIt will not be enough for him to establish that we can have knowledge\nof some propositions without demonstrating them: unless it is\nin turn possible to deduce all the other propositions of a science\nfrom them, we shall not have solved the regress problem. Moreover (and\nobviously), it is no solution to this problem for Aristotle simply to\nassert that we have knowledge without demonstration of some\nappropriate starting points. He does indeed say that it is his\nposition that we have such knowledge (An. Post. I.2,), but he\nowes us an account of why that should be so.\n6.4 Knowledge of First Principles: Nous\n\nAristotle\u2019s account of knowledge of the indemonstrable first\npremises of sciences is found in Posterior Analytics II.19,\nlong regarded as a difficult text to interpret. Briefly, what he says\nthere is that it is another cognitive state, nous (translated\nvariously as \u201cinsight\u201d, \u201cintuition\u201d,\n\u201cintelligence\u201d), which knows them. There is wide\ndisagreement among commentators about the interpretation of his\naccount of how this state is reached; I will offer one possible\ninterpretation. First, Aristotle identifies his problem as explaining\nhow the principles can \u201cbecome familiar to us\u201d, using the\nsame term \u201cfamiliar\u201d (gn\u00f4rimos) that he\nused in presenting the regress problem. What he is presenting, then,\nis not a method of discovery but a process of becoming wise. Second,\nhe says that in order for knowledge of immediate premises to be\npossible, we must have a kind of knowledge of them without having\nlearned it, but this knowledge must not be as \u201cprecise\u201d as\nthe knowledge that a possessor of science must have. The kind of\nknowledge in question turns out to be a capacity or power\n(dunamis) which Aristotle compares to the capacity for\nsense-perception: since our senses are innate, i.e., develop\nnaturally, it is in a way correct to say that we know what e.g. all\nthe colors look like before we have seen them: we have the capacity to\nsee them by nature, and when we first see a color we exercise this\ncapacity without having to learn how to do so first. Likewise,\nAristotle holds, our minds have by nature the capacity to recognize\nthe starting points of the sciences.\n\nIn the case of sensation, the capacity for perception in the sense\norgan is actualized by the operation on it of the perceptible object.\nSimilarly, Aristotle holds that coming to know first premises is a\nmatter of a potentiality in the mind being actualized by experience of\nits proper objects: \u201cThe soul is of such a nature as to be\ncapable of undergoing this\u201d. So, although we cannot come to know\nthe first premises without the necessary experience, just as we cannot\nsee colors without the presence of colored objects, our minds are\nalready so constituted as to be able to recognize the right objects,\njust as our eyes are already so constituted as to be able to perceive\nthe colors that exist.\n\nIt is considerably less clear what these objects are and how it is\nthat experience actualizes the relevant potentialities in the soul.\nAristotle describes a series of stages of cognition. First is what is\ncommon to all animals: perception of what is present. Next is memory,\nwhich he regards as a retention of a sensation: only some animals have\nthis capacity. Even fewer have the next capacity, the capacity to form\na single experience (empeiria) from many repetitions of the\nsame memory. Finally, many experiences repeated give rise to knowledge\nof a single universal (katholou). This last capacity is\npresent only in humans.\n\nSee Section 7 of the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s psychology\n for more on his views about mind.\n7. Definitions\n\nThe definition (horos, horismos)\nwas an important matter for Plato and for the Early Academy. Concern\nwith answering the question \u201cWhat is so-and-so?\u201d are at\nthe center of the majority of Plato\u2019s dialogues, some of which\n(most elaborately the Sophist) propound methods for finding\ndefinitions. External sources (sometimes the satirical remarks of\ncomedians) also reflect this Academic concern with definitions.\nAristotle himself traces the quest for definitions back to\nSocrates.\n7.1 Definitions and Essences\n\nFor Aristotle, a definition is \u201can account which signifies what\nit is to be for something\u201d (logos ho to ti \u00ean einai\ns\u00eamainei). The phrase \u201cwhat it is to be\u201d and\nits variants are crucial: giving a definition is saying, of some\nexistent thing, what it is, not simply specifying the meaning of a\nword (Aristotle does recognize definitions of the latter sort, but he\nhas little interest in them).\n\nThe notion of \u201cwhat it is to be\u201d for a thing is so\npervasive in Aristotle that it becomes formulaic: what a definition\nexpresses is \u201cthe what-it-is-to-be\u201d (to ti \u00ean\neinai), or in modern terminology, its essence.\n7.2 Species, Genus, and Differentia\n\nSince a definition defines an essence, only what has an essence can be\ndefined. What has an essence, then? That is one of the central\nquestions of Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics; once again, we must leave\nthe details to another article. In general, however, it is not\nindividuals but rather species (eidos: the\nword is one of those Plato uses for \u201cForm\u201d) that have\nessences. A species is defined by giving its genus\n(genos) and its differentia\n(diaphora): the genus is the kind under which the species\nfalls, and the differentia tells what characterizes the species within\nthat genus. As an example, human might be defined as\nanimal (the genus) having the capacity to reason\n(the differentia).\nEssential Predication and the Predicables\n\nUnderlying Aristotle\u2019s concept of a definition is the concept of\nessential predication (kat\u00eagoreisthai en\nt\u00f4i ti esti, predication in the what it is). In any true\naffirmative predication, the predicate either does or does not\n\u201csay what the subject is\u201d, i.e., the predicate either is\nor is not an acceptable answer to the question \u201cWhat is\nit?\u201d asked of the subject. Bucephalus is a horse, and a horse is\nan animal; so, \u201cBucephalus is a horse\u201d and\n\u201cBucephalus is an animal\u201d are essential predications.\nHowever, \u201cBucephalus is brown\u201d, though true, does not\nstate what Bucephalus is but only says something about him.\n\nSince a thing\u2019s definition says what it is, definitions are\nessentially predicated. However, not everything essentially predicated\nis a definition. Since Bucephalus is a horse, and horses are a kind of\nmammal, and mammals are a kind of animal, \u201chorse\u201d\n\u201cmammal\u201d and \u201canimal\u201d are all essential\npredicates of Bucephalus. Moreover, since what a horse is is a kind of\nmammal, \u201cmammal\u201d is an essential predicate of horse. When\npredicate \\(X\\) is an essential predicate of \\(Y\\) but also of other\nthings, then \\(X\\) is a genus (genos) of\n\\(Y\\).\n\nA definition of \\(X\\) must not only be essentially predicated of it\nbut must also be predicated only of it: to use a term from\nAristotle\u2019s Topics, a definition and what it defines\nmust \u201ccounterpredicate\u201d\n(antikat\u00eagoreisthai) with one another. \\(X\\)\ncounterpredicates with \\(Y\\) if \\(X\\) applies to what \\(Y\\) applies to\nand conversely. Though X\u2019s definition must counterpredicate with\n\\(X\\), not everything that counterpredicates with \\(X\\) is its\ndefinition. \u201cCapable of laughing\u201d, for example,\ncounterpredicates with \u201chuman\u201d but fails to be its\ndefinition. Such a predicate (non-essential but counterpredicating) is\na peculiar property or proprium\n(idion).\n\nFinally, if \\(X\\) is predicated of \\(Y\\) but is neither essential nor\ncounterpredicates, then \\(X\\) is an accident\n(sumbeb\u00eakos) of \\(Y\\).\n\nAristotle sometimes treats genus, peculiar property, definition, and\naccident as including all possible predications (e.g. Topics\nI). Later commentators listed these four and the differentia as the\nfive predicables, and as such they were of great\nimportance to late ancient and to medieval philosophy (e.g.,\nPorphyry).\n7.3 The Categories\n\nThe notion of essential predication is connected to what are\ntraditionally called the categories\n(kat\u00eagoriai). In a word, Aristotle is famous for having\nheld a \u201cdoctrine of categories\u201d. Just what that doctrine\nwas, and indeed just what a category is, are considerably more vexing\nquestions. They also quickly take us outside his logic and into his\nmetaphysics. Here, I will try to give a very general overview,\nbeginning with the somewhat simpler question \u201cWhat categories\nare there?\u201d\n\nWe can answer this question by listing the categories. Here are two\npassages containing such lists:\n\nWe should distinguish the kinds of predication (ta gen\u00ea\nt\u00f4n kat\u00eagori\u00f4n) in which the four predications\nmentioned are found. These are ten in number: what-it-is, quantity,\nquality, relative, where, when, being-in-a-position, having, doing,\nundergoing. An accident, a genus, a peculiar property and a definition\nwill always be in one of these categories. (Topics I.9,\n103b20\u201325)\n\n\nOf things said without any combination, each signifies either\nsubstance or quantity or quality or a relative or where or when or\nbeing-in-a-position or having or doing or undergoing. To give a rough\nidea, examples of substance are man, horse; of quantity: four-foot,\nfive-foot; of quality: white, literate; of a relative: double, half,\nlarger; of where: in the Lyceum, in the market-place; of when:\nyesterday, last year; of being-in-a-position: is-lying, is-sitting; of\nhaving: has-shoes-on, has-armor-on; of doing: cutting, burning; of\nundergoing: being-cut, being-burned. (Categories 4,\n1b25\u20132a4, tr. Ackrill, slightly modified)\n\n\nThese two passages give ten-item lists, identical except for their\nfirst members. What are they lists \\(of\\)? Here are three ways they\nmight be interpreted:\n\nThe word \u201ccategory\u201d (kat\u00eagoria) means\n\u201cpredication\u201d. Aristotle holds that predications and\npredicates can be grouped into several largest \u201ckinds of\npredication\u201d (gen\u00ea t\u00f4n\nkat\u00eagori\u00f4n). He refers to this classification\nfrequently, often calling the \u201ckinds of predication\u201d\nsimply \u201cthe predications\u201d, and this (by way of Latin)\nleads to our word \u201ccategory\u201d.\n\nFirst, the categories may be kinds of predicate:\npredicates (or, more precisely, predicate expressions) can be divided\ninto ten separate classes, with each expression belonging to just one\nclass. This comports well with the root meaning of the word\nkat\u00eagoria (\u201cpredication\u201d). On this\ninterpretation, the categories arise out of considering the most\ngeneral types of question that can be asked about something:\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d; \u201cHow much is\nit?\u201d; \u201cWhat sort is it?\u201d;\n\u201cWhere is it?\u201d; \u201cWhat is it\ndoing?\u201d Answers appropriate to one of these questions\nare nonsensical in response to another (\u201cWhen is it?\u201d\n\u201cA horse\u201d). Thus, the categories may rule out certain\nkinds of question as ill-formed or confused. This plays an important\nrole in Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics.\nSecond, the categories may be seen as classifications of\npredications, that is, kinds of relation that may hold\nbetween the predicate and the subject of a predication. To say of\nSocrates that he is human is to say what he \\(is\\), whereas to say\nthat he is literate is not to say what he is but rather to give a\nquality that he has. For Aristotle, the relation of predicate\nto subject in these two sentences is quite different (in this respect\nhe differs both from Plato and from modern logicians). The categories\nmay be interpreted as ten different ways in which a predicate may be\nrelated to its subject. This last division has importance for\nAristotle\u2019s logic as well as his metaphysics.\nThird, the categories may be seen as kinds of entity, as\nhighest genera or kinds of thing that are. A given thing can be\nclassified under a series of progressively wider genera: Socrates is a\nhuman, a mammal, an animal, a living being. The categories are the\nhighest such genera. Each falls under no other genus, and each is\ncompletely separate from the others. This distinction is of critical\nimportance to Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics.\n\n\nWhich of these interpretations fits best with the two passages above?\nThe answer appears to be different in the two cases. This is most\nevident if we take note of point in which they differ: the\nCategories lists substance (ousia)\nin first place, while the Topics list\nwhat-it-is (ti esti). A substance, for\nAristotle, is a type of entity, suggesting that the\nCategories list is a list of types of entity.\n\nOn the other hand, the expression \u201cwhat-it-is\u201d suggests\nmost strongly a type of predication. Indeed, the Topics\nconfirms this by telling us that we can \u201csay what it is\u201d\nof an entity falling under any of the categories:\n\nan expression signifying what-it-is will sometimes signify a\nsubstance, sometimes a quantity, sometimes a quality, and sometimes\none of the other categories.\n\n\nAs Aristotle explains, if I say that Socrates is a man, then I have\nsaid what Socrates is and signified a substance; if I say that white\nis a color, then I have said what white is and signified a quality; if\nI say that some length is a foot long, then I have said what it is and\nsignified a quantity; and so on for the other categories. What-it-is,\nthen, here designates a kind of predication, not a kind of entity.\n\nThis might lead us to conclude that the categories in the\nTopics are only to be interpreted as kinds of predicate or\npredication, those in the Categories as kinds of being. Even\nso, we would still want to ask what the relationship is between these\ntwo nearly-identical lists of terms, given these distinct\ninterpretations. However, the situation is much more complicated.\nFirst, there are dozens of other passages in which the categories\nappear. Nowhere else do we find a list of ten, but we do find shorter\nlists containing eight, or six, or five, or four of them (with\nsubstance/what-it-is, quality, quantity, and relative the most\ncommon). Aristotle describes what these lists are lists of in\ndifferent ways: they tell us \u201chow being is divided\u201d, or\n\u201chow many ways being is said\u201d, or \u201cthe figures of\npredication\u201d (ta sch\u00eamata t\u00eas kat\u00eagorias). The\ndesignation of the first category also varies: we find not only\n\u201csubstance\u201d and \u201cwhat it is\u201d but also the\nexpressions \u201cthis\u201d or \u201cthe this\u201d (tode\nti, to tode, to ti). These latter expressions\nare closely associated with, but not synonymous with, substance. He\neven combines the latter with \u201cwhat-it-is\u201d\n(Metaphysics Z 1, 1028a10: \u201c\u2026 one sense\nsignifies what it is and the this, one signifies quality\n\u2026\u201d).\n\nMoreover, substances are for Aristotle fundamental for predication as\nwell as metaphysically fundamental. He tells us that everything that\nexists exists because substances exist: if there were no substances,\nthere would not be anything else. He also conceives of predication as\nreflecting a metaphysical relationship (or perhaps more than one,\ndepending on the type of predication). The sentence \u201cSocrates is\npale\u201d gets its truth from a state of affairs consisting of a\nsubstance (Socrates) and a quality (whiteness) which is in that\nsubstance. At this point we have gone far outside the realm of\nAristotle\u2019s logic into his metaphysics, the fundamental question\nof which, according to Aristotle, is \u201cWhat is a\nsubstance?\u201d. (For further discussion of this topic, see the\nentry on\n Aristotle\u2019s Categories\n and the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics,\n (Section 2).\n\nSee Frede 1981, Ebert 1985 for additional discussion of\nAristotle\u2019s lists of categories.\n\nFor convenience of reference, I include a table of the categories,\nalong with Aristotle\u2019s examples and the traditional names often\nused for them. For reasons explained above, I have treated the first\nitem in the list quite differently, since an example of a substance\nand an example of a what-it-is are necessarily (as one might put it)\nin different categories.\n\n\n\nTraditional\u00a0name\nLiterally\nGreek\nExamples \n\nSubstance\nsubstance\n\n\u201cthis\u201d\n\nwhat-it-is\nousia\n\ntode ti\n\nti esti\nman, horse\n\nSocrates\n\n\u201cSocrates is a man\u201d \n\nQuantity\nHow much\nposon\nfour-foot, five-foot \n\nQuality\nWhat sort\npoion\nwhite, literate \n\nRelation\nrelated to what\npros ti\ndouble, half, greater \n\nLocation\nWhere\npou\nin the Lyceum, in the marketplace \n\nTime\nwhen\npote\nyesterday, last year \n\nPosition\nbeing situated\nkeisthai\nlies, sits \n\nHabit\nhaving, possession\nechein\nis shod, is armed \n\nAction\ndoing\npoiein\ncuts, burns \n\nPassion\nundergoing\npaschein\nis cut, is burned  \n\n7.4 The Method of Division\n\nIn the Sophist, Plato introduces a procedure of\n\u201cDivision\u201d as a method for discovering definitions. To\nfind a definition of \\(X\\), first locate the largest kind of thing\nunder which \\(X\\) falls; then, divide that kind into two parts, and\ndecide which of the two \\(X\\) falls into. Repeat this method with the\npart until \\(X\\) has been fully located.\n\nThis method is part of Aristotle\u2019s Platonic legacy. His attitude\ntowards it, however, is complex. He adopts a view of the proper\nstructure of definitions that is closely allied to it: a correct\ndefinition of \\(X\\) should give the genus\n(genos: kind or family) of \\(X\\), which tells what kind of\nthing \\(X\\) is, and the differentia\n(diaphora: difference) which uniquely identifies \\(X\\) within\nthat genus. Something defined in this way is a\nspecies (eidos: the term is one of\nPlato\u2019s terms for \u201cForm\u201d), and the differentia is\nthus the \u201cdifference that makes a species\u201d (eidopoios\ndiaphora, \u201cspecific difference\u201d). In Posterior\nAnalytics II.13, he gives his own account of the use of Division\nin finding definitions.\n\nHowever, Aristotle is strongly critical of the Platonic view of\nDivision as a method for establishing definitions. In\nPrior Analytics I.31, he contrasts Division with the\nsyllogistic method he has just presented, arguing that Division cannot\nactually prove anything but rather assumes the very thing it is\nsupposed to be proving. He also charges that the partisans of Division\nfailed to understand what their own method was capable of proving.\n7.5 Definition and Demonstration\n\nClosely related to this is the discussion, in Posterior\nAnalytics II.3\u201310, of the question whether there can be\nboth definition and demonstration of the same thing (that is, whether\nthe same result can be established either by definition or by\ndemonstration). Since the definitions Aristotle is interested in are\nstatements of essences, knowing a definition is knowing, of some\nexisting thing, what it is. Consequently, Aristotle\u2019s question\namounts to a question whether defining and demonstrating can be\nalternative ways of acquiring the same knowledge. His reply is\ncomplex:\n\nNot everything demonstrable can be known by finding definitions,\nsince all definitions are universal and affirmative whereas some\ndemonstrable propositions are negative.\nIf a thing is demonstrable, then to know it just is to possess its\ndemonstration; therefore, it cannot be known just by definition.\nNevertheless, some definitions can be understood as demonstrations\ndifferently arranged.\n\n\nAs an example of case 3, Aristotle considers the definition\n\u201cThunder is the extinction of fire in the clouds\u201d. He sees\nthis as a compressed and rearranged form of this demonstration:\n\nSound accompanies the extinguishing of fire.\nFire is extinguished in the clouds.\nTherefore, a sound occurs in the clouds.\n\n\nWe can see the connection by considering the answers to two questions:\n\u201cWhat is thunder?\u201d \u201cThe extinction of fire in the\nclouds\u201d (definition). \u201cWhy does it thunder?\u201d\n\u201cBecause fire is extinguished in the clouds\u201d\n(demonstration).\n\nAs with his criticisms of Division, Aristotle is arguing for the\nsuperiority of his own concept of science to the Platonic concept.\nKnowledge is composed of demonstrations, even if it may also include\ndefinitions; the method of science is demonstrative, even if it may\nalso include the process of defining.\n8. Dialectical Argument and the Art of Dialectic\n\nAristotle often contrasts dialectical arguments with\ndemonstrations. The difference, he tells us, is in the character of\ntheir premises, not in their logical structure: whether an argument is\na sullogismos is only a matter of whether its conclusion\nresults of necessity from its premises. The premises of demonstrations\nmust be true and primary, that is, not only true but also\nprior to their conclusions in the way explained in the Posterior\nAnalytics. The premises of dialectical deductions, by contrast,\nmust be accepted (endoxos).\n8.1 Dialectical Premises: The Meaning of Endoxos\n\nRecent scholars have proposed different interpretations of the term\nendoxos. Aristotle often uses this adjective as a\nsubstantive: ta endoxa, \u201caccepted things\u201d,\n\u201caccepted opinions\u201d. On one understanding, descended from\nthe work of G. E. L. Owen and developed more fully by Jonathan Barnes\nand especially Terence Irwin, the endoxa are a compilation of\nviews held by various people with some form or other of standing:\n\u201cthe views of fairly reflective people after some\nreflection\u201d, in Irwin\u2019s phrase. Dialectic is then simply\n\u201ca method of argument from [the] common beliefs [held by these\npeople]\u201d. For Irwin, then, endoxa are \u201ccommon\nbeliefs\u201d. Jonathan Barnes, noting that endoxa are\nopinions with a certain standing, translates with\n\u201creputable\u201d.\n\nMy own view is that Aristotle\u2019s texts support a somewhat\ndifferent understanding. He also tells us that dialectical premises\ndiffer from demonstrative ones in that the former are\nquestions, whereas the latter are assumptions or\nassertions: \u201cthe demonstrator does not ask, but\ntakes\u201d, he says. This fits most naturally with a view of\ndialectic as argument directed at another person by question and\nanswer and consequently taking as premises that other person\u2019s\nconcessions. Anyone arguing in this manner will, in order to be\nsuccessful, have to ask for premises which the interlocutor is liable\nto accept, and the best way to be successful at that is to have an\ninventory of acceptable premises, i.e., premises that are in fact\nacceptable to people of different types.\n\nIn fact, we can discern in the Topics (and the\nRhetoric, which Aristotle says depends on the art explained\nin the Topics) an art of dialectic for use in such arguments.\nMy reconstruction of this art (which would not be accepted by all\nscholars) is as follows.\n8.2 The Two Elements of the Art of Dialectic\n\nGiven the above picture of dialectical argument, the dialectical art\nwill consist of two elements. One will be a method for discovering\npremises from which a given conclusion follows, while the other will\nbe a method for determining which premises a given interlocutor will\nbe likely to concede. The first task is accomplished by developing a\nsystem for classifying premises according to their logical structure.\nWe might expect Aristotle to avail himself here of the syllogistic,\nbut in fact he develops quite another approach, one that seems less\nsystematic and rests on various \u201ccommon\u201d terms. The second\ntask is accomplished by developing lists of the premises which are\nacceptable to various types of interlocutor. Then, once one knows what\nsort of person one is dealing with, one can choose premises\naccordingly. Aristotle stresses that, as in all arts, the dialectician\nmust study, not what is acceptable to this or that specific person,\nbut what is acceptable to this or that type of person, just as the\ndoctor studies what is healthful for different types of person:\n\u201cart is of the universal\u201d.\n8.2.1 The \u201cLogical System\u201d of the Topics\n\nThe method presented in the Topics for classifying arguments\nrelies on the presence in the conclusion of certain\n\u201ccommon\u201d terms (koina) \u2014 common in the\nsense that they are not peculiar to any subject matter but may play a\nrole in arguments about anything whatever. We find enumerations of\narguments involving these terms in a similar order several times.\nTypically, they include:\n\nOpposites (antikeimena, antitheseis)\n\n\nContraries (enantia)\nContradictories (apophaseis)\nPossession and Privation (hexis kai ster\u00easis)\nRelatives (pros ti)\n \nCases (pt\u00f4seis)\n\u201cMore and Less and Likewise\u201d\n\n\nThe four types of opposites are the best represented.\nEach designates a type of term pair, i.e., a way two terms can be\nopposed to one another. Contraries are polar\nopposites or opposed extremes such as hot and cold, dry and wet, good\nand bad. A pair of contradictories consists of a term\nand its negation: good, not good. A possession (or\ncondition) and privation are illustrated by sight and\nblindness. Relatives are relative terms in the modern\nsense: a pair consists of a term and its correlative, e.g. large and\nsmall, parent and child.\n\nThe argumentative patterns Aristotle associated with\ncases generally involve inferring a sentence\ncontaining adverbial or declined forms from another sentence\ncontaining different forms of the same word stem: \u201cif what is\nuseful is good, then what is done usefully is done well and the useful\nperson is good\u201d. In Hellenistic grammatical usage,\npt\u00f4sis meant \u201ccase\u201d (e.g. nominative,\ndative, accusative); Aristotle\u2019s use here is obviously an early\nform of that.\n\nUnder the heading more and less and likewise,\nAristotle groups a somewhat motley assortment of argument patterns all\ninvolving, in some way or other, the terms \u201cmore\u201d,\n\u201cless\u201d, and \u201clikewise\u201d. Examples: \u201cIf\nwhatever is \\(A\\) is \\(B\\), then whatever is more (less) \\(A\\) is more\n(less) \\(B\\)\u201d; \u201cIf \\(A\\) is more likely \\(B\\) than \\(C\\)\nis, and \\(A\\) is not \\(B\\), then neither is \\(C\\)\u201d; \u201cIf\n\\(A\\) is more likely than \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) is the case, then \\(A\\) is\nthe case\u201d.\n8.2.2 The Topoi\n\nAt the heart of the Topics is a collection of what Aristotle\ncalls topoi, \u201cplaces\u201d or \u201clocations\u201d.\nUnfortunately, though it is clear that he intends most of the\nTopics (Books II\u2013VI) as a collection of these, he never\nexplicitly defines this term. Interpreters have consequently disagreed\nconsiderably about just what a topos is. Discussions may be\nfound in Brunschwig 1967, Slomkowski 1996, Primavesi 1997, and Smith\n1997.\n8.3 The Uses of Dialectic and Dialectical Argument\n\nAn art of dialectic will be useful wherever dialectical\nargument is useful. Aristotle mentions three such uses; each merits\nsome comment.\n8.3.1 Gymnastic Dialectic\n\nFirst, there appears to have been a form of stylized argumentative\nexchange practiced in the Academy in Aristotle\u2019s time. The main\nevidence for this is simply Aristotle\u2019s Topics,\nespecially Book VIII, which makes frequent reference to rule-governed\nprocedures, apparently taking it for granted that the audience will\nunderstand them. In these exchanges, one participant took the role of\nanswerer, the other the role of questioner. The answerer began by\nasserting some proposition (a thesis: \u201cposition\u201d\nor \u201cacceptance\u201d). The questioner then asked questions of\nthe answerer in an attempt to secure concessions from which a\ncontradiction could be deduced: that is, to refute\n(elenchein) the answerer\u2019s position. The questioner was\nlimited to questions that could be answered by yes or no; generally,\nthe answerer could only respond with yes or no, though in some cases\nanswerers could object to the form of a question. Answerers might\nundertake to answer in accordance with the views of a particular type\nof person or a particular person (e.g. a famous philosopher), or they\nmight answer according to their own beliefs. There appear to have been\njudges or scorekeepers for the process. Gymnastic dialectical contests\nwere sometimes, as the name suggests, for the sake of exercise in\ndeveloping argumentative skill, but they may also have been pursued as\na part of a process of inquiry.\n8.3.2 Dialectic That Puts to the Test\n\nAristotle also mentions an \u201cart of making trial\u201d, or a\nvariety of dialectical argument that \u201cputs to the test\u201d\n(the Greek word is the adjective peirastik\u00ea, in the\nfeminine: such expressions often designate arts or skills, e.g.\nrh\u00eatorik\u00ea, \u201cthe art of rhetoric\u201d).\nIts function is to examine the claims of those who say they have some\nknowledge, and it can be practiced by someone who does not possess the\nknowledge in question. The examination is a matter of refutation,\nbased on the principle that whoever knows a subject must have\nconsistent beliefs about it: so, if you can show me that my beliefs\nabout something lead to a contradiction, then you have shown that I do\nnot have knowledge about it.\n\nThis is strongly reminiscent of Socrates\u2019 style of\ninterrogation, from which it is almost certainly descended. In fact,\nAristotle often indicates that dialectical argument is by nature\nrefutative.\n8.3.3 Dialectic and Philosophy\n\nDialectical refutation cannot of itself establish any proposition\n(except perhaps the proposition that some set of propositions is\ninconsistent). More to the point, though deducing a contradiction from\nmy beliefs may show that they do not constitute knowledge, failure to\ndeduce a contradiction from them is no proof that they are true. Not\nsurprisingly, then, Aristotle often insists that \u201cdialectic does\nnot prove anything\u201d and that the dialectical art is not some\nsort of universal knowledge.\n\nIn Topics I.2, however, Aristotle says that the art of\ndialectic is useful in connection with \u201cthe philosophical\nsciences\u201d. One reason he gives for this follows closely on the\nrefutative function: if we have subjected our opinions (and the\nopinions of our fellows, and of the wise) to a thorough refutative\nexamination, we will be in a much better position to judge what is\nmost likely true and false. In fact, we find just such a procedure at\nthe start of many of Aristotle\u2019s treatises: an enumeration of\nthe opinions current about the subject together with a compilation of\n\u201cpuzzles\u201d raised by these opinions. Aristotle has a\nspecial term for this kind of review: a diaporia, a\n\u201cpuzzling through\u201d.\n\nHe adds a second use that is both more difficult to understand and\nmore intriguing. The Posterior Analytics argues that if\nanything can be proved, then not everything that is known is known as\na result of proof. What alternative means is there whereby the first\nprinciples of sciences are known? Aristotle\u2019s own answer as\nfound in Posterior Analytics II.19 is difficult to interpret,\nand recent philosophers have often found it unsatisfying since (as\noften construed) it appears to commit Aristotle to a form of apriorism\nor rationalism both indefensible in itself and not consonant with his\nown insistence on the indispensability of empirical inquiry in natural\nscience.\n\nAgainst this background, the following passage in Topics I.2\nmay have special importance:\n\nIt is also useful in connection with the first things concerning each\nof the sciences. For it is impossible to say anything about the\nscience under consideration on the basis of its own principles, since\nthe principles are first of all, and we must work our way through\nabout these by means of what is generally accepted about each. But\nthis is peculiar, or most proper, to dialectic: for since it is\nexaminative with respect to the principles of all the sciences, it has\na way to proceed.\n\n\nA number of interpreters (beginning with Owen 1961) have built on this\npassage and others to find dialectic at the heart of Aristotle\u2019s\nphilosophical method. Further discussion of this issue would take us\nfar beyond the subject of this article (the fullest development is in\nIrwin 1988; see also Nussbaum 1986 and Bolton 1990; for criticism,\nHamlyn 1990, Smith 1997).\n9. Dialectic and Rhetoric\n\nAristotle says that rhetoric, i.e., the study of persuasive speech, is\na \u201ccounterpart\u201d (antistrophos) of dialectic and\nthat the rhetorical art is a kind of \u201coutgrowth\u201d\n(paraphues ti) of dialectic and the study of character types.\nThe correspondence with dialectical method is straightforward:\nrhetorical speeches, like dialectical arguments, seek to persuade\nothers to accept certain conclusions on the basis of premises they\nalready accept. Therefore, the same measures useful in dialectical\ncontexts will, mutatis mutandis, be useful here: knowing what premises\nan audience of a given type is likely to believe, and knowing how to\nfind premises from which the desired conclusion follows.\n\nThe Rhetoric does fit this general description: Aristotle\nincludes both discussions of types of person or audience (with\ngeneralizations about what each type tends to believe) and a summary\nversion (in II.23) of the argument patterns discussed in the\nTopics. For further discussion of his rhetoric see\n Aristotle\u2019s rhetoric.\n10. Sophistical Arguments\n\nDemonstrations and dialectical arguments are both forms of valid\nargument, for Aristotle. However, he also studies what he calls\ncontentious (eristikos) or\nsophistical arguments: these he defines as arguments\nwhich only apparently establish their conclusions. In fact, Aristotle\ndefines these as apparent (but not genuine) dialectical\nsullogismoi. They may have this appearance in either of two\nways:\n\nArguments in which the conclusion only appears to follow of\nnecessity from the premises (apparent, but not genuine,\nsullogismoi).\nGenuine sullogismois the premises of which are merely\napparently, but not genuinely, acceptable.\n\n\nArguments of the first type in modern terms, appear to be valid but\nare really invalid. Arguments of the second type are at first more\nperplexing: given that acceptability is a matter of what people\nbelieve, it might seem that whatever appears to be endoxos\nmust actually be endoxos. However, Aristotle probably has in\nmind arguments with premises that may at first glance seem to\nbe acceptable but which, upon a moment\u2019s reflection, we\nimmediately realize we do not actually accept. Consider this example\nfrom Aristotle\u2019s time:\n\nWhatever you have not lost, you still have.\nYou have not lost horns.\nTherefore, you still have horns\n\n\nThis is transparently bad, but the problem is not that it is invalid:\nthe problem is rather that the first premise, though superficially\nplausible, is false. In fact, anyone with a little ability to follow\nan argument will realize that at once upon seeing this very\nargument.\n\nAristotle\u2019s study of sophistical arguments is contained in\nOn Sophistical Refutations, which is actually a sort of\nappendix to the Topics.\n\nTo a remarkable extent, contemporary discussions of fallacies\nreproduce Aristotle\u2019s own classifications. See Dorion 1995 for\nfurther discussion.\n11. Non-Contradiction and Metaphysics\n\nTwo frequent themes of Aristotle\u2019s account of science are (1)\nthat the first principles of sciences are not demonstrable and (2)\nthat there is no single universal science including all other sciences\nas its parts. \u201cAll things are not in a single genus\u201d, he\nsays, \u201cand even if they were, all beings could not fall under\nthe same principles\u201d (On Sophistical Refutations 11).\nThus, it is exactly the universal applicability of dialectic that\nleads him to deny it the status of a science.\n\nIn Metaphysics IV (\u0393), however, Aristotle takes what\nappears to be a different view. First, he argues that there is, in a\nway, a science that takes being as its genus (his name for it is\n\u201cfirst philosophy\u201d). Second, he argues that the principles\nof this science will be, in a way, the first principles of all (though\nhe does not claim that the principles of other sciences can be\ndemonstrated from them). Third, he identifies one of its first\nprinciples as the \u201cmost secure\u201d of all principles: the\nprinciple of non-contradiction. As he states it,\n\nIt is impossible for the same thing to belong and not belong\nsimultaneously to the same thing in the same respect (Met. )\n\n\nThis is the most secure of all principles, Aristotle tells us, because\n\u201cit is impossible to be in error about it\u201d. Since it is a\nfirst principle, it cannot be demonstrated; those who think otherwise\nare \u201cuneducated in analytics\u201d. However, Aristotle then\nproceeds to give what he calls a \u201crefutative\ndemonstration\u201d (apodeixai elenktik\u00f4s) of this\nprinciple.\n\nFurther discussion of this principle and Aristotle\u2019s arguments\nconcerning it belong to a treatment of his metaphysics (see\n Aristotle: Metaphysics).\n However, it should be noted that: (1) these arguments draw on\nAristotle\u2019s views about logic to a greater extent than any\ntreatise outside the logical works themselves; (2) in the logical\nworks, the principle of non-contradiction is one of Aristotle\u2019s\nfavorite illustrations of the \u201ccommon principles\u201d\n(koinai archai) that underlie the art of dialectic.\n\nSee\n Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics,\n Aristotle on non-contradiction, Dancy 1975, and Code 1986 for further discussion.\n12. Time and Necessity: The Sea-Battle\n\nThe passage in Aristotle\u2019s logical works which has received\nperhaps the most intense discussion in recent decades is On\nInterpretation 9, where Aristotle discusses the question whether\nevery proposition about the future must be either true or false.\nThough something of a side issue in its context, the passage raises a\nproblem of great importance to Aristotle\u2019s near contemporaries\n(and perhaps contemporaries).\n\nA contradiction (antiphasis) is a pair of\npropositions one of which asserts what the other denies. A major goal\nof On Interpretation is to discuss the thesis that, of every\nsuch contradiction, one member must be true and the other false. In\nthe course of his discussion, Aristotle allows for some exceptions.\nOne case is what he calls indefinite propositions\nsuch as \u201cA man is walking\u201d: nothing prevents both this\nproposition and \u201cA man is not walking\u201d being\nsimultaneously true. This exception can be explained on relatively\nsimple grounds.\n\nA different exception arises for more complex reasons. Consider these\ntwo propositions:\n\nThere will be a sea-battle tomorrow\nThere will not be a sea-battle tomorrow\n\n\nIt seems that exactly one of these must be true and the other false.\nBut if (1) is now true, then there must be a\nsea-battle tomorrow, and there cannot fail to be a sea-battle\ntomorrow. The result, according to this puzzle, is that nothing is\npossible except what actually happens: there are no unactualized\npossibilities.\n\nSuch a conclusion is, as Aristotle is quick to note, a problem both\nfor his own metaphysical views about potentialities and for the\ncommonsense notion that some things are up to us. He therefore\nproposes another exception to the general thesis concerning\ncontradictory pairs.\n\nThis much would probably be accepted by most interpreters. What the\nrestriction is, however, and just what motivates it are matters of\nwide disagreement. It has been proposed, for instance, that Aristotle\nadopted, or at least flirted with, a three-valued logic for future\npropositions, or that he countenanced truth-value gaps, or that his\nsolution includes still more abstruse reasoning. The literature is\nmuch too complex to summarize: see Anscombe, Hintikka, D. Frede,\nWhitaker, Waterlow.\n\nHistorically, at least, it is likely that Aristotle is responding to\nan argument originating with the Megarian philosophers. He ascribes\nthe view that only that which happens is possible to the Megarians in\nMetaphysics IX (\u0398). The puzzle with which he is\nconcerned strongly recalls the \u201cMaster Argument\u201d of\n Diodorus Cronus\n especially in certain further details. For instance, Aristotle\nimagines the statement about tomorrow\u2019s sea battle having been\nuttered ten thousand years ago. If it was true, then its truth was a\nfact about the past; if the past is now unchangeable, then so is the\ntruth value of that past utterance. This recalls the Master\nArgument\u2019s premise that \u201cwhat is past is necessary\u201d.\nDiodorus Cronus was active a little after Aristotle, and he was\ncertainly influenced by Megarian views, whether or not it is correct\nto call him a Megarian (David Sedley 1977 argues that he was instead a\nmember of the\n Dialectical School\n which was in any event an offshoot of the Megarians; see Dorion 1995\nand D\u00f6ring 1989, Ebert 2008 and the article Dialectical School).\nIt is therefore likely that Aristotle\u2019s target here is some\nMegarian argument, perhaps a forerunner of Diodorus\u2019 Master\nArgument.\n13.
