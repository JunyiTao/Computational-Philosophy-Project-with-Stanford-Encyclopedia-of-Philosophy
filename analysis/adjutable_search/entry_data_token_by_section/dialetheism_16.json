    "main_text": "Dialetheism and Rationality || Accepting and Asserting Dialetheias\n5.2 Accepting and Asserting Dialetheias\n\nIf some contradictions are true, it is natural to expect that a\ndialetheist will sometimes accept, or believe in, contradictions, and\nassert them. Priest (2006, p. 109) adopts the following Rationality\nPrinciple:\n\n(RP) If you have good evidence for the truth of \\(A\\), you ought to\naccept \\(A\\). \n\nBelief, acceptance, and assertion have a point: when we\nbelieve and assert, what we aim at is believing and asserting what is\nthe case or, equivalently, the truth. Therefore, the dialetheist will\naccept and, sometimes, assert both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\), if she has\nevidence that \\(A\\) is a dialetheia.\n\nNotice that this need not entail that the dialetheist both accepts\nand rejects \\(A\\) at the same time. We now come back to the\nissue flagged in Section 4.2, on the irreducibility of rejection to\nnegation. That rejecting \\(A\\) is tantamount to accepting its negation\nis a common view, famously endorsed and defended (more precisely in\nterms of the corresponding speech acts of assertion and denial) by\nFrege and Peter Geach. But dialetheists have argued that this fusion\nis a confusion (see Berto 2008 on this issue). The point can be made\nindependently of the issue of dialetheism: a paracompletist may well\nwant to deny \\(A\\), but it would be unfair to take such a denial as\nequivalent to the assertion of \\(\\neg A\\), since if \\(A\\) is\ntruth-valueless, \\(\\neg A\\) is normally considered truth-valueless,\ntoo, not a truth, and so not to be asserted. A dual position can hold\nfor dialetheism: given that accepting \\(\\neg A\\) is different from\nrejecting \\(A\\), a dialetheist can do the former and not the\nlatter\u2014exactly when she thinks that \\(A\\) is a dialetheia.\n\nDoes this show that dialetheism is compatible with rationality? The\nstory about assertion and denial, acceptance and rejection has been\nchallenged from several directions. We will just mention a few. \n\nRestall (2015) argues that the the acceptance/rejection issue makes\ngappy and glutty approaches symmterical: gap theorists cannot assert\nsome true claims about paradoxes, but glut theorists cannot reject\nsome false claims about non-paradoxes; see also Restall 2013, Jenny\n2017. In a note by Laura Goodship (1996), she suggests that the\nproposal of separating denial from assertion of negation runs into\nproblems related, again, to Curry\u2019s paradox. Her proposal is, in\neffect, that it would be more natural for dialetheists to both accept\nand reject things after all. Focusing on the phenomenon of\ndisagreement in natural language, Ripley (2015a) argues that\ndialetheists (and paracompleteists) should rejoin classical logicians\nin taking negation to embed denial, and denial to express\ndisagreement. Ripley proposes that dialetheists simply admit that (1)\nagreement and disagreement are incompatible\n(\u201cit\u2019s incoherent to do both\u201d, p. 306), but (2) in\nsome cases, assert and deny the same thing. The result would be what\nRipley calls paracoherentism, which (in echo of\nparaconsistency) would try to allow local incoherence without global\nincoherence. How this could be done is an open question. Ripley\nsuggests dropping the transitivity of logical consequence. Goodship\nherself ultimately recommends dropping modus ponens, a proposal that\nhas been dubbed the \u2018Goodship project\u2019 (Beall 2015, Omori\n2016, Priest 2017). \n\nThere certainly are various other arguments against dialetheism in the\nphilosophical market (see papers in Priest et al. 2004). For example,\nZalta (2004, p. 432) argues that preserving \u201cour pretheoretic\nunderstanding of what it is to exemplify or instantiate a\nproperty\u201d requires us to preserve the LNC. This entry has\npresented only some of the most immediate issues that arise in\nobjections and replies.\n",
