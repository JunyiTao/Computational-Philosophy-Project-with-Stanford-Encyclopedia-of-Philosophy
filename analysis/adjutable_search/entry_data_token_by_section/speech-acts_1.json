Content, Force, and How Saying Can Make It So\n\n\nWhereas an act of speech is any act of\nuttering[3]\nmeaningful words, \u2018speech act\u2019 is a term of\nart. As a first approximation, speech acts are those acts that can (though need\nnot) be performed by saying that one is doing so. On this conception,\nresigning, promising, asserting and asking are all speech acts, while\nconvincing, insulting and growing six inches are not. One can, for\ninstance, resign by saying, \u201cI resign\u2026\u201d, although one\ncan also resign from a position without describing oneself as doing\nso. However, this conception is too inclusive, since it also\ncounts whispering as a speech act even though one can whisper a string\nof nonsense words without meaning anything. Instead a more accurate\ncharacterization of speech acts builds on Grice\u2019s notion of\nspeaker meaning. This notion is discussed further in Section 5 below,\nbut for now it is enough to note that in looking at my watch, I might\nbe trying to tell the time; or I might be trying to indicate to you\nthat it\u2019s time for us to leave. The latter (but not the former)\nis a case of speaker meaning.\n\nAccordingly, a speech act is a type of act that can be\nperformed by speaker meaning that one is doing so. This conception\nstill counts resigning, promising, asserting and asking as speech\nacts, while ruling out convincing, insulting and whispering. This\ndefinition leaves open the possibility of speech acts being performed\nwordlessly, as well as speech acts being performed without saying that\nyou are doing so. Our characterization of speech acts captures this\nfact in emphasizing speaker meaning rather than the uttering of any\nwords.\n\nSpeech acts are thus also to be distinguished from\nperformatives. \u2018Performative\u2019 is another technical term,\nand as used here it refers in the first instance to a kind of\nsentence. A performative sentence is in the first person,\npresent tense, indicative mood, active voice, that describes its\nspeaker as performing a speech act. \u2018I assert that George is the\nculprit,\u2019 is a performative sentence by this test. As we have\nseen, one can perform a speech act without uttering a\nperformative. Further, since it is merely a type of sentence, one can\nutter a performative without performing a speech act. For instance,\nwhile talking in my sleep I might say, \u201cI hereby promise to\nclimb the Eiffel Tower,\u201d without thereby making any promise. We\nmay also define a performative utterance as an utterance of\na performative sentence that is also a speech\nact.[4]\n\nMore nomenclature: \u2018Speech act\u2019 and\n\u2018illocution\u2019 will here be used synonymously. The latter\nterm is due to Austin, who used \u2018illocutionary force\u2019 to\nrefer to a dimension of communicative acts. (It is nowadays common\nalso to use \u2018illocute\u2019 as a verb meaning \u2018to perform\na speech act.\u2019) Austin\u2019s reason for using\n\u2018force\u2019 begins with the observation that, construed as a\nbit of observable behavior, the communicative significance of an act\nmay be underdetermined by what has been said or observably done. I bow\ndeeply before you. So far you may not know whether I am paying\nobeisance, responding to indigestion, or looking for a wayward contact\nlens. So too, an utterance of a meaningful sentence (which Austin\ncalls a locutionary act) such as \u2018You\u2019ll be more\npunctual in the future,\u2019 may leave you wondering whether I am\nmaking a prediction or issuing a command or even a threat. The\ncolloquial question, \u201cWhat is the force of those words?\u201d\nis often used to elicit an answer. In asking such a question we\nacknowledge a grasp of those words\u2019 meaning but seek to know how\nthat meaning is to be taken\u2013as a threat, as a prediction, or as\na command.\n\nOr so it seems. In an early challenge to Austin, Cohen (1964) argues\nthat the notion of illocutionary force is otiose provided we already\nhave in place the notion of a sentence\u2019s meaning (Austin\u2019s locutionary\nmeaning). Cohen contends that for a performative sentence such as\n\u2018I promise to read that novel,\u2019 its meaning already\nguarantees that it is a promise. On the other hand, for a sentence\nthat is not a performative, such as \u2018I will read that\nnovel,\u2019 if it is understood as being used to make a promise, the\npromise is still implicit in the sentence\u2019s meaning. In either case,\nCohen concludes, meaning already guarantees force and so we do not\nrequire an extra-semantic notion to do so.\n\nCohen\u2019s reasoning assumes that any utterance of \u2018I promise\nto read that novel\u2019 is a promise. But as we have seen with the\ncase of the somniloquist, neither a sentence, nor even the utterance\nof a sentence, is sufficient on its own for the performance of a\nspeech act, be it a promise or some other. In a similar spirit to that\nof Cohen, Searle (1968, p. 407) observes that a serious and literal\nutterance of \u2018I promise to read that novel,\u2019 made under\nwhat he terms \u201cconditions of successful utterance\u201d, also\ncounts as a promise. Searle concludes from this that some locutionary\nacts are also illocutionary acts, and infers from this in turn that\nfor some sentences, their locutionary meaning determines their\nillocutionary force. This last inference is, however, a non\nsequitur. As we have seen, the aforementioned sentence\u2019s\nmeaning does not determine the illocutionary force with which it is\nuttered. Rather, when that sentence is uttered in such a way as to\nconstitute a promise, what determines that force is the meaning of the\nsentence together with such factors as the speaker\u2019s\nbeing serious and other contextual conditions being met.\n\nWe may thus agree with Searle that some locutionary acts are also\nillocutionary acts, without losing sight of our earlier observation\nthat locutionary meaning underdetermines illocutionary force. This\nfact about underdetermination is implied by Davidson\u2019s Thesis of the\nAutonomy of Linguistic Meaning, according to which once a bit of\nlanguage has acquired a conventional meaning, it can be used for any\nof a variety of extra-linguistic purposes (Davidson, 1979). Green 1997\nargues for a qualification of Davidson\u2019s Autonomy Thesis to recognize\nsentences having the feature that if they are used in a speech act\nall, then there is at least one other illocutionary force that their\nutterance must have. Even in light of this qualified version of the\nAutonomy Thesis, the most that can be said of, \u2018I promise to\nclimb the Eiffel Tower,\u2019 is that it is designed to be used to\nmake promises, just as common nouns are designed to be used to refer\nto things and predicates are designed to characterize things referred\nto. Below (Section 6.3) we shall consider the view that force is a\ncomponent of meaning, albeit not of a sentence\u2019s\nmeaning.[5]\n",
