    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n2. Metaphysics\n\nDiscussions of the metaphysics of artifacts have typically\narisen only in broader investigative contexts in which they are\nnot the primary focus of attention. In particular, the metaphysics of\nordinary objects has generated a significant literature in recent\nyears, and the puzzles about existence around which it revolves do\napply to artifacts, but equally to the vast array of other ordinary\nobjects, like stones, stars, trees, jellyfish and deer. Similarly,\nreflection on artifact kinds has been largely overshadowed by the vast\nliterature on natural kinds, and discussions of artifact function\nexist on the periphery of the much more prominent discussions of\nbiological function. Finally, questions about the existence of\nabstract artifacts have arisen in the context of investigations into\nthe ontology of works of art. We will take up these topics in\nturn.\n",
