    "main_text": "Some related terms || Scepticism\n6.1 Scepticism\n\nThe term scepticism (skepticism) has at least three distinct usages\nthat are relevant for the discussion on pseudoscience. First,\nscepticism is a philosophical method that proceeds by casting doubt on\nclaims usually taken to be trivially true, such as the existence of\nthe external world. This has been, and still is, a highly useful\nmethod for investigating the justification of what we in practice\nconsider to be certain beliefs. Secondly, criticism of pseudoscience\nis often called scepticism. This is the term most commonly used by\norganisations devoted to the disclosure of pseudoscience. Thirdly,\nopposition to the scientific consensus in specific areas is sometimes\ncalled scepticism. For instance, climate science deniers often call\nthemselves \u201cclimate sceptics\u201d. \n\nTo avoid confusion, the first of these notions can be specified as\n\u201cphilosophical scepticism\u201d, the second as\n\u201cscientific scepticism\u201d or \u201cdefence of\nscience\u201d, and the third as \u201cscience denial(ism)\u201d.\nAdherents of the first two forms of scepticism can be called\n\u201cphilosophical sceptics\u201d, respectively \u201cscience\ndefenders\u201d. Adherents of the third form can be called\n\u201cscience deniers\u201d or \u201cscience denialists\u201d.\nTorcello (2016) proposed the term \u201cpseudoscepticism\u201d for\nso-called climate scepticism.\n",
