Specific Moral Challenges at the Cultural Level\n\nIn the section above, the focus was on the moral impacts of\ninformation technologies on the individual user. In this section, the\nfocus will be on how these technologies shape the moral landscape at\nthe societal level. At the turn of the twentieth century the term\n\u201cweb 2.0\u201d began to surface and it referred to the new way\nthat the world wide web was being used as a medium for information\nsharing and collaboration as well as a change in the mindset of web\ndesigners to include more interoperability and user-centered\nexperiences on their websites. This term has also become associated\nwith \u201csocial media\u201d and \u201csocial networking.\u201d\nWhile the original design of the World Wide Web in 1989 by its creator\nTim Berners-Lee was always one that included notions of meeting others\nand collaborating with them online, users were finally ready to fully\nexploit those capabilities by 2004 when the first Web 2.0 conference\nwas held by O\u2019Reilly Media (O\u2019Reilly 2007 [2005]). \nThis change has meant that a growing number of people have\nbegun to spend significant portions of their lives online with other\nusers experiencing a new unprecedented lifestyle. Social networking is\nan important part of many people\u2019s lives worldwide. Vast numbers of\npeople congregate on sites like Facebook and interact with friends old\nand new, real and virtual. The Internet offers the immersive\nexperience of interacting with others in virtual worlds where\nenvironments are constructed entirely out of information. Just now,\nemerging onto the scene are technologies that will allow us to merge\nthe real and the virtual. This new form of \u201caugmented\nreality\u201d is facilitated by the fact that many people now carry\nGPS enabled smart phones and other portable computers with them upon\nwhich they can run applications that let them interact with their\nsurroundings and their computers at the same time, perhaps looking at\nan item though the camera in their device and the \u201capp\u201d\ncalling up information about that entity and displaying it in a bubble\nabove the item. Each of these technologies comes with their own suite\nof new moral challenges some of which will be discussed below.\n",
