    "main_text": "The Subjugation of Women || The role of prejudice\n3.1 The role of prejudice\n\nRight at the beginning of the first part of De\nl\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, Poulain compares prejudice\nconcerning the sexes to other equally persistent, but unjustified\nbeliefs. First, he points out that apart \n\n\nfrom a few scholars, everyone thinks that it is indubitable that the\nSun moves around the Earth, despite the fact that what we observe in\nthe revolutions of the days and the years leads those who examine it\nto believe that it is the Earth that moves around the Sun. (T1en 122;\nTTfr 59) \n\n\nSecond, he refers to people, who imagine that animals are intelligent\nbeings guided by reason, just \n\n\nlike primitive people who suppose that there are little souls inside\nthe clocks and machines that they are shown though they know nothing\nabout their construction or their inner springs. (T1en 122\u2013123;\nTTfr 59) \n\n\nFinally, and perhaps most interestingly, Poulain refers to social\nprejudices, which cause people to believe that their own country is\nthe best, because it is most familiar, and \n\n\nthat the religion in which they were reared is the true religion that\nmust be followed, even if they may never have thought of examining it\nor comparing it with other religious traditions. (T1en 123; TTfr 60)\n\n\n\nThese social prejudices also include beliefs concerning wealth and\nrank, and Poulain points out that \u201cthe unequal distribution of\ngoods and offices causes many people to conclude that human beings are\nnot equal to each other\u201d (ibid.).\n\nPoulain\u2019s comparisons place his analysis of the relations\nbetween the sexes in the framework of new science, including both\nastronomy and mechanistic explanations of the animal body, as well as\nin the framework of current ideas about religious freedom and human\nequality. He claims that when properly examined, the equality of the\nsexes should be as evident as the newly established fact that the\nearth moves around the sun.\n\nPoulain continues by emphasizing that when one examines the\nfoundations of prejudice one finds that these beliefs are based on\nmere self-interest and custom. Interestingly, he is also quite aware\nthat beliefs based on prejudice are more difficult to change than\nbeliefs based on reason. He points out that when \n\n\nsomeone\u2019s opinion is based only on prejudice, it is incomparably\nmore difficult to change their minds than if they had been convinced\nby reasons that seem strong and persuasive to them. (T1en 123; TTfr\n60) \n\n\nPeople can make mistakes when they think that they have strong\nevidence to believe what they believe, but people who make this kind\nof mistakes are more prone to change their minds when they encounter\nnew evidence than people who hold untrue beliefs based on prejudice (for an excellent discussion of Poulain\u2019s Cartesian analysis of prejudice, see Schmitter 2018; also Fraisse 1985).\nThe persistance of prejudice is an important insight, which is still very relevant for\ndiscussions about our \u201cpost-truth\u201d society and different forms of populist rhetoric.\n\nWhen discussing prejudices about the inferiority of women, Poulain\nemphasizes that these are particularly difficult to overcome because\nthey are shared by both men and women. He writes that these beliefs,\nthough unjustified, seem\n\n\nall the more convincing when one considers how women themselves\ntolerate their condition. They accept it as if it were natural to\nthem, either because they do not think at all about what they are or\nbecause, having been born and reared in dependency, they think about\nit in the same way as men. (T1en 126; TTfr 63)\n\n\nHere Poulain touches upon the important\u2014and also still\nrelevant\u2014topic of internalized prejudice (also Schmitter 2018, 6\u20139). The subjugation of\nwomen does not consist only in the political and economic power men\nexercise over them, but also in the fact that women internalize their\nsubjected position and perceive it as natural. In twenty-first\ncentury feminist philosophy this same insight provides the ground for\ndiscussions about the objectification of women (Haslanger 1993;\nLangton 2000) as well as about implicit biases and so called\nstereotype threat, which can affect the performance of disadvantaged\ngroups in situations where they identify themselves as inadequate\nperformers (Saul 2013).\n\nSince subjection is in part based on false self-understanding, Poulain\nis very aware that we need true self-knowledge in order to liberate\nourselves. In De l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 he points out\nthat \u201c[s]elf-knowledge is absolutely necessary in order to\naddress [the equality of the sexes] properly\u201d and following his\nemphasis on the bodily aspect of the human condition, he adds that\nthis concerns \u201cespecially knowledge of the body\u201d (T1en\n155; TTfr 97). In De l\u2019\u00e9ducation, Poulain\ndevotes the whole fourth conversation to the topic of self-knowledge\nand though he does not in this context explicitly address the question\nof the equality of the sexes, he makes several important remarks on\nhow our self-knowledge is affected by the prejudiced opinions of\nothers. Stasimachus explains:\n\n\nWe are prejudiced about nearly everything that exists, and most of all\nabout ourselves. We are not only the authors of the prejudice but also\nits theater and its victims. As far as the things that touch us most\nclosely are concerned, we immolate ourselves to our ghosts, so to\nspeak. [\u2026] Although we are made in a certain way, and nature\nmakes us realize that and protests constantly against our own\nimagination, we still try to be the way people tell us we are. (TTen\n212; TTfr 243)\n\n\nPoulain\u2019s account is remarkably aware of what we would call the\nunconscious aspects of our minds and of the difficulties to change our\nself-conception even in cases when we consciously know that we are the\nvictim of prejudice. He was clearly aware of the ongoing French\ndiscussion of self-knowledge, where Neo-Augustinian thinkers such as\nPierre Nicole and Blaise Pascal questioned its possibility, and he\ncombined a defense of the achievability of self-knowledge against\nthose who claim that knowing oneself is \n\n\nlike moving mountains and that we will never get to the end of it,\nthat man is hidden from himself, that there are countless hidden\nrecesses of the heart he can never uncover (TTen 211; TTfr 242) \n\n\nwith a nuanced awareness of the difficulties involved (for a detailed\ndiscussion see Reuter 2017: 44\u201349).\n",
