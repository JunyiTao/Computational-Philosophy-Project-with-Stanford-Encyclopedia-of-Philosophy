The Theory of Objects in the Munich and G\u00f6ttingen Circles\n\nThe previous section introduced phenomenological descriptions of\nvarious kinds of experiences. These descriptions are presented by\nphenomenologists as \u201ceidetic\u201d, which means that they are\nsupposed to identify the essential properties of the experiences at\nissue. Phenomenology, however, is not merely concerned with providing\neidetic descriptions of mental experiences. That is why the\n\u201cphenomenology of acts\u201d (Aktph\u00e4nomenologie)\nshould be distinguished from (although it is not unrelated to) the\n\u201cphenomenology of objects\u201d\n(Gegenstandsph\u00e4nomenologie, Geiger 1907: 355). Among\nother tasks, the latter discipline (also called \u201ctheory of\nobjects\u201d or \u201contology\u201d) is concerned with the\nidentification of the essential properties exemplified by objects of\nall kinds (and not only by objects of the mental kind).\n",
