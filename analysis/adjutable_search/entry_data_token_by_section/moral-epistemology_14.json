It understands knowledge to be primarily a social\nachievement (see entry for Social Epistemology). Moral\nknowledge may be still more deeply social than is generally\nrecognized, even among those who grant that justifying moral beliefs\ninvolves a social process of interactive reasoning within a\ncognitively diverse group. When moral consistency reasoning is part of\nthe social justification process, the reasoning entails efforts to\neliminate emotional inconsistencies in thinking (Campbell and Kumar\n2012). In that case moral knowledge, if it were achieved, would be\nembodied not only in the beliefs of those seeking knowledge, but also\nin their motivations and feelings. Indeed, given the cognitive basis\nof moral emotions, it is possible for a society to know through their\nfeelings of guilt that they have done morally wrong even when they\nbelieve otherwise for ideological reasons, parallel to the case of the\nwomen who cannot shake her feelings of resentment for being unfairly\npassed over for promotion in favour of a male colleague when she\nbelieves her feelings cannot justified given the lesser social status\nof women (Campbell 2007).\n",
