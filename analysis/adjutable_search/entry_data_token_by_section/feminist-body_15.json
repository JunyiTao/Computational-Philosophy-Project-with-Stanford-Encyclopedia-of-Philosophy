In her work a phenomenological account is employed to give an\naccount of those identity categories which are anchored in material\nbodily features, what she terms visible identities. Alcoff is\noffering an account which integrates social identity categories with\npeople\u2019s experiences of the bodies of themselves and others.\nFocusing primarily on raced and gendered identities, she makes clear\nthe way in which bodily features, (color, hair, nose, breasts,\ngenitals) are invested with a significance which becomes a part of our\nimmediate perceptual experience of them: \n\n\nBoth race and sex \u2026 are most definitely physical, marked on and\nthrough the body, lived as a material experience, visible as surface\nphenomena and determinant of economic and political status. (2006:\n102) \n\n\nBecause of the material reality of the features and the immediacy of\nour perceptual response, the meanings attached to such features become\nnaturalized. The fact that they are the product of learned modes of\nperception is not evident to us, for such perceptual practices have\nbecome habitual and are resistant to change. She points out how\n\u201crace and gender consciousness produce habitual bodily\nmannerisms that feel natural and become unconscious after long\nuse\u201d (2006: 108).\n\nThe significance, therefore, of certain bodily shapes, informs our\nsense of our own body and of the bodies of others. The sense of our\nown body reflects, as was articulated by Sartre, Fanon, and Beauvoir,\nthe way it is perceived by others. The very shape of the body carries\nits position in patterns of social interaction. In a striking example\nregarding raced physiognomies, Alcoff quotes from Rodriguez\u2019s\nbook Days of Obligation (1992): \n\n\nI used to stare at the Indian in the mirror. The wide nostrils\n\u2026 the thick lips \u2026. Such a long face\u2014such a long\nnose\u2014sculpted by indifferent, blunt thumbs, and of such common\nclay. No one in my family had a face as dark or as Indian as mine.\nMy face could not portray the ambition I brought to it.\n(Alcoff 2006: 189; my emphasis) \n\n\nAmbition is something expressible in a body of a different kind, and\nthe face he looks at points to a positioning at odds with what he\ndesires. Although Alcoff restricts her analysis to race and sex, it is\nclear that it also has relevance to other bodily identities. The body\nin the wheelchair has similar difficulty expressing physical prowess\nthat Rodriguez\u2019s has of expressing ambition. Lennon and Alsop\n(2019, Ch. 7) point out, that such a framework makes sense of the\ndesires of some trans people for corporeal transformation. For\nexperiences of material features of the body are foundational to our\nsense of our sexed identity and used by others to position us in\npatterns of social interaction. Despite the polarising and often\ndamaging consequences of the perceptual practices which Alcoff draws\nour attention to, she remains optimistic about the possibilities for\nchange, though stressing the difficulties of even bringing these\npractices into view. Such changes require that people are brought to\nviewexpereince their own bodies and the bodies of others in a\ndifferent way: \u201cperceptual practices are dynamic even when\ncongealed into habit \u2026 people are capable of change\u201d\n(Alcoff 2006: 189).\n",
