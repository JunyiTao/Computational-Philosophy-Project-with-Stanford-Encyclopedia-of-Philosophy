    "main_text": "The Curry-Howard Correspondence\n8. Contemporary Formalism\n\nLater developments have been primarily in the \u2018Hilbertian\u2019\nwing of the formalist movement. P. J. Cohen\u2019s work on the\ngeneralised continuum hypothesis showed, in tandem with\nG\u00f6del\u2019s relative consistency proof, that it and countless\nrelated set-theoretic propositions concerning the relations of the\ncardinality of a set to that of its powerset are undecidable by\ncurrent axioms. With no obvious, non-ad hoc, ways to extend the axioms\nto decide these questions, this led some mathematicians, such as Cohen\nhimself (Cohen, 1971) and Abraham Robinson, (Robinson, 1965; 1969) to\ndespair of a realistic interpretation of higher set theory. They\ntherefore treat branches of mathematics in which no plausible axiom\nset will decide the key questions as \u2018ideal\u2019 parts of\nmathematics, lacking the content to be found in other areas.\n\nAs to game formalism, although philosophers may accuse mathematicians\nof a tendency to lapse into this seemingly discredited position, very\nfew philosophers advance views resembling the game formalists. Gabbay\n(2010) and Azzouni (2004; 2005; 2006; 2009) have flown under the\nformalist flag. Gabbay\u2019s formalism (which he develops only with\nrespect to arithmetic in the paper cited) occupies \u2018lush middle\nground between traditional formalism, fictionalism, logicism and\nrealism\u2019 (Gabbay, 2010: 219). Moreover he writes \u2018Contrary\nto traditional (game) formalism, my proposal shall not involve an\nattempt to provide formal derivations of each and every arithmetic\ntruth\u2019 (Gabbay, 2010: 221).\n\nAzzouni describes his \u2018version of formalism\u2019 (Azzouni,\n2004: 105) as one in which ordinary mathematical proofs\n\u2018indicate\u2019 formal derivations. The indication relation is\nleft rather open: Azzouni does not claim that the indicated\nderivations all belong to a single formal system; rather ordinary\nproofs can indicate derivations from a \u2018family\u2019 of formal\nderivations. However, the indicated derivations, Azzouni says need not\nexist; certainly concrete tokens of them need not exist in the same\nperiod as the informal proofs which indicate them. Proofs in ancient\nGreek geometry indicate 21st century or later derivations. They may\nnever, in fact, exist\u2014they may be too long ever to be written\ndown (Azzouni, 2006: 154) though these non-existent proofs are\nsupposed to explain the consensus among mathematicians about which\ninformal proofs are correct! In later work Azzouni seems to retreat\nfrom this (or any) brand of formalism:\n\nI kept falling (against my will) into a view that mathematicians had\nto be engaged in something like sophisticated syntactic\npattern-recognition while perusing informal mathematical proofs, so\nthat they would be sensitive (without realizing it) to a background of\nnonexistent formal derivations. (Azzouni, 2009: 25)\n\n\nmoving to an \u2018inference package\u2019 view of mathematical\nreasoning which does not seem formalist: see again Azzouni (2009).\n\n\nThere are, however, another group of contemporary philosophers of\nmathematics whose views seem close to formalism, namely (some among\nthe) fictionalists. Now the term \u2018fictionalist\u2019 can\nmislead as not all fictionalists assimilate mathematics to fiction.\nAnd even if one did, the question would arise: \u2018What\nphilosophical account of fiction, and discourse about fiction, does\none adopt?\u2019 Many philosophers resile from a realist ontology of\nfictional characters just as many reject a\nrealist\u2014platonistic\u2014ontology for mathematics. A very\nsimplistic anti-realism about fictionalism might analyse such\nstatements as \u2018Oliver Twist was born in London\u2019 as true\n(or correct) just in case that sentence, or a synonym, occurs in\nDickens\u2019s novel (Field, 1989: 3). Even if this worked for\nfiction, which it pretty clearly does\n not,[5]\n a parallel approach for mathematics is patently absurd. If a\nmathematical thesis is proclaimed a theorem, with or without proof, in\na journal, be it however respectable then, even if this claim is never\nchallenged and the assertion accepted by the mathematical community\nthis by no means entails that the thesis is true (or correct, if one\ndislikes applying truth predicates to mathematical sentences). Given\nthe number of \u201ctheorems\u201d whose purported proofs were later\ndiscovered to be incorrect, we can be pretty sure some falsehoods will\nwrongly remain accepted for all time as proven. Moreover there will be\nno end of mathematical claims, some true, some false, which never make\nit into the mathematical literature at all, never being considered by\nactual mathematicians.\n\nNow the Oliver Twist example is owing to Hartry Field, the founder of\nthe school of fictionalism, if we may term it such. But he qualifies\nhis position as follows:\n\nmost of us believe that Oliver Twist lived in London only in the sense\nthat we believe that the novel says that or has as a\nconsequence that Oliver Twist lived in London (1989, 3) [emphasis\nmine].\n\n\nWhether or not this will work for fiction (What if the work is\ninconsistent: must one use a relevant consequence relation? How can it\nhandle comparisons among different works as in the Tolstoy/Dostoyevsky\nexample above?) this is an interesting position on mathematics with\ndefinite formalistic overtones. The mathematician can put forward any\n(consistent) theory she likes. The truths of the theory are then just\nthe consequences of the theory, there is no need to think that the\ntheory represents an external reality. Fictionalism along these lines\nhas been investigated by Mary Leng (2010). But a key question is: how\ndoes one read \u2018consequence\u2019? For a formalist, this has to\nbe consequence as derivability. But Leng rejects such a reading: her\nfictionalism is one in which logical consequence is interpreted not\nsyntactically but modally, with the necessity in question taken as\nprimitive. Hence, this subspecies of fictionalism cannot be classed as\nformalist.\n\nWeir, by contrast, explicitly embraces formalism (1991; 1993; 2010;\n2016), moreover formalism in the game formalism tradition. His\nposition, if situated with respect to fictionalism, can be seen as one\nin which \u2018consequence\u2019 is read, in the formalist\ntradition, syntactically, in terms of formal derivability. As a first\napproximation, the position is that a mathematical sentence is true if\nthere exists a concrete derivation of a token of it, false if\nthere exists a concrete derivation of a token of its negation. Since\ntruth and falsity conditions make no appeal to abstract proofs, this\ntype of formalism is firmly anti-platonist. \n\nThis bluntly concretist formalism would seem to face insuperable\nproblems: for example in the shape of the \u2018concretely\nundecidable\u2019, those short theses with unfeasibly long proofs or\ndisproofs mentioned above in connection with Goodman and Quine\u2019s\nnominalism. Weir\u2019s attempt to address such problems takes as its\nbasis a fairly common \u2018post-Fregean\u2019 or\n\u2018neo-Fregean\u2019 perspective on language. Frege, at least\nearly in his career, held that the truth value of a sentence is\ndetermined by two factors, the Sinn, the sense, literal meaning\nor informational content, of the sentence; and the way the world is.\nIndexicality and wider context relativity of sentences he initially\nsupposed could be met by assuming speakers who uttered and grasped\nsuch sentences took them as elliptical for more complete utterances\nwhose sense fixed, in combination with the world, a unique truth\nvalue.\n\nLater work (including Frege\u2019s own) revealed the inadequacy of\nthis picture, revealed that some indexicality, for instance, is\n\u2018essential\u2019 in John Perry\u2019s phrase, to the thought\nexpressed. I can utter \u2018it\u2019s hot now\u2019 truly without\nknowing where, when or even who (if sufficiently disoriented or out my\nhead) I am. Those who are not utterly sceptical, as radical\ncontextualists are, of systematic theories of meaning, will amend\nFrege\u2019s view to a tripartite one. A sentence\u2019s truth\nvalue, in a particular context, is determined by its informational\ncontent, by contextual circumstances related to, \u2018fitted\nto\u2019, the utterance by aspects of the speakers\u2019 practice,\nand finally by the mind and language-independent world. The contextual\ncircumstances need not figure in the sense or informational content of\nthe utterance; thus a specification of them may include dates and\nlocations, though this is not part of the sense of \u2018it\u2019s\nhot now\u2019 (compare Kaplan\u2019s character versus\ncontent distinction, especially the second sense of\n\u2018content\u2019 discussed in his 1989 (fn 28: 503)). \n\nThis picture in turn suggests the idea that the contextual\ncircumstances which \u2018make true\u2019, in conjunction with\nindependent reality, an utterance, may make it true in a non-realist\nfashion. In Weir\u2019s version of game formalism, the fundamental\nidea is that what makes true (or false) \\(\\text{\u2018}\\sin^2\\theta\n+\\cos^2\\theta = 1\\text{\u2019}\\) in a particular system is the existence of\na concrete proof or refutation, though the statement that such a\nconcrete proof exists is no part of the literal meaning or sense of\nthe claim. \n\nThe advantage of this type of formalism is that it not only affirms\nthe meaningfulness, the possession of sense, of mathematical\nutterances; in sharp contrast with traditional game formalism, it\nholds that such utterances have truth values, where proofs or\nrefutations exist. The problem of the metatheory is met if one can\ngive, after the fashion of Goodman and Quine 1947, a non-mathematical\naccount of concrete proof. Of course, as noted above, severe problems\nremain. The problem of applicability has to be met, by providing\nconservative extension proofs for example. And of course the theory is\nthreatened not only by G\u00f6del\u2014type incompleteness and the\nundecidable\u2014but intuitively truth-valued\u2013 sentences it\nthrows up; even more devastating indeterminacy looms in the form of\n\u2018concretely undecidable\u2019 sentences such as Tennant\u2019s\nprimality claim of section 5. \n\nOne strategy for dealing with these problems is to combine formalism\nwith strict finitism (for one brand of which see Yessinin-Volpin\n(1961; 1970) and for criticism Dummett (1975): only feasibly long\n\u201cdigestible\u201d tokens\u2014of formulae and of proofs\u2014exist.\nFormulae with no feasible proofs or disproofs simply lack truth value.\nSince we know from G\u00f6delian speed-up considerations that for many a\nprovable sentence the shortest derivations of it or its negation are\nvastly longer than the sentence itself, this finitist/formalism\nposition threatens to cause havoc across large areas of perfectly\nordinary mathematics. \n\nWeir argues (2010; 2016) that finitist formalism is not only extremely\nradical, it is incoherent. The reason is the all-pervasive role of\nabbreviation which generates complex tokens where most of their\nsubparts will never exist, for example abbreviations which create\nnumerals naming (speaking with the platonist) arbitrarily high\nnumbers. As a result, strict finitist specifications cannot be given\nin the usual inductive fashion, as the intersection of all inductive\nsets containing the base set and closed under the complexity-forming\noperations. And this in turn means we cannot prove even very simple\nfacts about wffs and proof.\n\nIdealisation, then, is essential in metamathematics, including the\nidealised notions of truth and proof found in metamathematics. If the\nformalist is entitled to assert there are infinitely many primes,\nwhilst denying abstract objects exist, there seems no reason why she\ncannot affirm that there are infinitely many formulae or infinitely\nmany proofs, whilst also denying that abstract objects exist. Weir\n(2016: 38\u201339) therefore argues that the formalist can answer the\nproblem of concrete undecidables so long as there are concrete\nproofs (or proof sketches) of results to the effect that formal truth,\nfor a given language or sub-language, coincides with formal\nprovability, and that there is no reason to restrict idealisation for\nfinitary languages. \n\nIn conclusion, the formalist who espouses the meaningfulness and\nindeed truth of standard mathematical theories, including proof theory\nfor example, has more resources to meet such claims than classic game\nformalism. The question is whether these are enough to salvage a\nposition which it is fair to say most philosophers of mathematics\nstill think hopeless. There is, on the other hand, certainly no\nuniversal consensus that formalism is dead and buried and signs of\nstrong sympathy for formalism among some mathematicians and computer\nscientists. \n",
