Neurath\u2019s place in logical empiricism: physicalism, anti-foundationalism, holism, naturalism, externalism, pragmatism\n3.1 On Language\n\nNeurath\u2019s later views on the language and method of science\nexpressed his simultaneous response to problems in the social sciences\nand to philosophical issues addressed by the Vienna Circle between\n1928 and 1934 and by Karl Popper. A primary aim of the Vienna Circle\nwas to account for the objectivity and intelligibility of scientific\nmethod and concepts. Their philosophical approach was to adopt what\nthe Circle member Gustav Bergmann called the linguistic turn, namely,\nto investigate the formal or structural, logical and linguistic\nframework of scientific knowledge. The formal approach encompassed\nlogicism and logical analysis as views about the formation and\njustification of theoretical statements. The problem of empiricism\nbecame then the problem of coordination between the formal theoretical\nstructures and the records of observations in such a way that it also\noffered an explication of how scientific knowledge can be formally\nconstructed (especially logic and mathematics), empirically grounded\n(except logic and mathematics), rational and objective.\n\nBesides his own early interest in logic and classical and ancient\nlanguages, the value of attention to language was familiar to Neurath\nfrom the Austrian fin-de-si\u00e8cle culture of critique of language\n(Janik and Toulmin 1973), his interest (and his first wife\u2019s) in\nliterature, especially in Goethe (Zemplen 2006, see above), the\ninternationalist and utopianists efforts at introducing new universal\nlanguages such as Volap\u00fck and Esperanto, the emphasis on signs\nand universal languages \u2013 to be known as pasigraphy \u2013 in\nthe scholastic and rationalist philosophical traditions, in the\ntraditions of empirical taxonomies and in the interest in universal\nlanguage as instrument of knowledge and social order in the\nEnlightenment, a semiotic tradition in scientific epistemology\nincluding Helmholtz, Mach, Duhem and Peirce (Cat 2019) and the\nsociologist Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies\u2019s formal approach to\nsociology and social signs (T\u00f6nnies 1899\u20131900 and\nCartwright et al. 1996, 121\u201324). The significance of\nthe internationalist and philosophical projects of pasigraphy were\nacknowledged also by Carnap. More \u201cscientific\u201d sources\nwere recent technical developments in logic, philosophy of science and\nthe foundation of mathematics often claiming Leibniz as a precursor\n(Leibniz\u2019s logic and project of a universal characteristic had\nbecome widely recognized by the late nineteenth century (Peckhaus\n2012)). Leading figures in such developments were Frege, Hilbert,\nWhitehead, Russell and Wittgenstein.\n\nDavid Hilbert placed the axiomatic tradition in mathematics on a\nformalist footing by eliminating the requirement of a fixed meaning\nfor primitive terms such as \u2019points\u2019 and\n\u2019lines\u2019 except holistically and implicitly, in the set of\naxioms or definitions in which they appear. Hilbert extended the\napplication of his program of axiomatics from geometry and arithmetic\nto physics. Gottlob Frege, followed by A.N. Whitehead and Bertrand\nRussell, sought to place mathematics, or at least arithmetic, on firm\nand rational principles of logic, which now included a theory of\nrelations and was to provide a comprehensive and unifying foundation.\nThe reductionist ideal was fatally criticized by Kurt G\u00f6del.\nRussell, having replaced idealist monism with perceptual atomism, next\nput the new logical framework to epistemological use in the scientific\nprogram of logical construction of objects of experience and thought.\nHis student Wittgenstein, in turn, introduced a linguistic philosophy\nthat limited the world to the scope of the application of an ideal\nsymbolic languages, or calculus. As a result, the sole task of\nphilosophy was, according to Wittgenstein, the critique of language in\nthe form of an activity of clarification, without yielding a\ndistinctive philosophical body of knowledge or set of\npropositions.\n\nLooking to the rationalist traditions of Descartes and Leibniz, Jean\nvan Heijenoort and Jaakko Hintikka have distinguished between two views\nof language that are relevant to the new linguistic turn (Mormann\n1999): language as calculus (LC) and language as universal medium\n(LUM). The LC tradition, illustrated by Tarski\u2019s views, aligned\nitself with the Cartesian ideal of a transparent language, with clear\nand distinctive meaning and explicit, mechanical combination and\nrule-following that extended to its use in reasoning. There are many\npossible constructed languages and each is an interpreted calculus\nwith different possible semantics. The LUM tradition adopted the idea\nof a single actual or ideal language and one semantic or\ninterpretation, to be elucidated, with no possibility of representing\nits relation to the world from outside. Views by Frege, who pointed to\nLeibniz on language and reasoning, and Wittgenstein illustrate this\ntradition, which in turn accommodates two versions, a Cartesian one\n(Frege and Russell) and a non-Cartesian one (Wittgenstein).\nCarnap\u2019s conversion to semantics in the early 1930s took him to\nthe LC Cartesian tradition seeking a universal language of rational\nreconstruction he had previously recognized in the language of\nphysics. Neurath, by contrast, modeled his unification of the sciences\nin the LUM tradition, on a universal mixed language he called a\nuniversal jargon, with descriptions of spatio-temporal arrangements\nand connections he called physicalism, historically contingent use of\nvague and ordinary terms (see below). In this context Neurath adopted\na militant syntacticism that opposed Carnap\u2019s defense of\nsemantics as metaphysical (Anderson 2019) and engaged in heated\nterminological disputes that ignored Carnap\u2019s commitment to\nontological neutrality (Carus 2019).\n\nThe Circle\u2019s projects shared the aforementioned focus on\nlanguage and experience. The \u2018linguistic turn\u2019, as it is\nknown, was adopted as a philosophical tool in order to explicate the\nrationality and the objectivity\u2014that is,\ninter-subjectivity\u2014and communicability of thought. Lacking the\ntranscendental dimension of Kant\u2019s metaphysical apparatus,\nattention to language extended to non-scientific cases such as\n\u2018ordinary language philosophy\u2019 in Oxford. In the context\nof logical empiricism, the formal dimension of knowledge was thought\nto be manifest particularly in the exactness of scientific statements.\nFor Schlick, knowledge proper, whether of experience or transcendent\nreality, was such only by virtue of form or\nstructure\u2014\u2018only structure is knowable\u2019. For Carnap,\nin addition, the formal dimension possessed distinct methodological\nvalues: it served the purpose of logical analysis and rational\nreconstruction of knowledge and helped expose and circumvent\n\u2018pseudo-philosophical\u2019 problems around metaphysical\nquestions about reality (his objections to Heidegger appealed to\nfailures of proper logical formulation and not just empirical\nverification). In 1934 he proposed as the task of philosophy the\nmetalinguistic analysis of logical and linguistic features of\nscientific method and knowledge (the \u2018thesis of\nmetalogic\u2019). For Neurath, this approach helped purge philosophy\nof deleterious metaphysical nonsense and dogmatism, and acknowledged\nthe radically social nature of language and science.\n3.2 From language to logic and its broader relevance\n\nNeurath enjoyed early attention and recognition for his logic work\nalso reflected in early reminiscences of figures such as Popper and\nthe mathematician Karl Menger. Perhaps now surprisingly, mentions of\nNeurath\u2019s and Olga Hahn\u2019s papers, including a joint one,\nwere included by the logicians C.I. Lewis, in 1918, and Alonzo Church,\nin 1936, in their canonical bibliographies on symbolic logic (Lewis\n1918 and Church 1936).Neurath kept algebraic logic and its symbolic\ndimension as a recurrent standard and resource, first in his earlier\nwork on the social sciences and pictorial language, and subsequently\nin related contributions to the discussions that informed logical\nempiricism (for a detailed discussion, see Cat 2019). The relevance to\nhis interest in political economy concerned the rational and\nscientific character of economic theory, the possibility of\nqualitative measurement and the limits of quantification and univocal\ndetermination, and, as a result, also of decision-making and\nprediction. Contrary to predominant accounts using attention to formal\nlanguages and logic to pit against each other wings and members of the\nlogical empiricist movement, the symbolic logical standard may be\nconsidered a unifying framework that distinguished Neurath with it and\nnot from it. It a unifying reference he willingly adopted when he\ncoined the term \u2019logical empiricism\u2019 (Mormann 1999 and Cat\n2019). The differentiating role in Neurath\u2019s positions can be\nidentified in his shifting and progressively skeptical and critical\nattention to the standard and the his attention to algebraic logic\nrather than the newer logic familiar to Carnap at work in Frege and\nRussell\u2019s logicism. \n\nLeibniz had given modern philosophical currency to the pasigraphic\nnotion of a universal characteristic or Alphabet of Thought that both\nexpressed reality and operated as a logical calculus of reasoning. In\nthe Cartesian spirit, language and reason were inseparable instruments\nof knowledge and mathematical, logical and philosophical methods were\nidentical. In the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth,\nLeibniz\u2019s project became a common reference in works in\nmathematical logic. Not only did Frege see his philosophy of language\nand mathematical logic within this tradition, as did Peano; Russell\npenned a landmark study and logicians such as Ernst Schr\u00f6der and\nLouis Couturat associated it distinctively with the development of\nalgebraic logic since Boole, especially with Schr\u00f6der\u2019s own\n(Peckhaus 2012 and Cat 2019). In this tradition the logician and\npolitical economist Stanley Jevons recovered the combinatorial element\nin Leibniz\u2019s method.\n\nNeurath\u2019s logic writings focused on Schr\u00f6der\u2019s\naxiomatic systematization of algebraic logic, mainly in the monumental\nVorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik (exakte Logik)\n(1890-95). There and in earlier writings, Schr\u00f6der geve a\nfundamental role to the relation of subsumption and a law of duality.\nSubsumption was a part-whole relation defined over domains of objects\nand it was expressed with a symbol, \u20ac, which denoted both\ninclusion and equality (with a corresponding algebraic expression,\nfollowing Hermann Grassmann, in terms of partial inequality \u2264) so\nthat if a \u20ac b and b \u20ac a, then a=b. The law of duality\nestablished a systematic correspondence between theorems in terms of 1\nand operation + and theorems in terms of 0 and operation x. The\nmethodological role of duality organizing and deriving theorems was\nexpressed in a dual-column presentation. The latter was adopted in a\nmore general spirit by Neurath and subsequently also by Carnap in his\npresentation of the systematic correspondence between formal and\nmaterial modes (see Cat 2019).\n\nBy the late nineteenth century, in Austria as well as Germany,\nalgebraic logic had found a central place in the raging controversies\nover the relationship between science and philosophy and, in\nparticular, between mathematics, logic and psychology. Neurath and\nOlga Hahn became acquainted with algebraic logic at the University of\nVienna sometime around 1902-3, but it wasn\u2019t until 1909, after\nOlga had become blind and Neurath was back in Vienna providing\nassistance, that she started working on algebraic logic for her\ndoctorate in philosophy. In 1909 Wilhelm Wundt had published a third\nvolume of his Logik; in 1909, part 1 of Schr\u00f6der\u2019s\nsynthetic treatment, Abriss der Algebra der Logik appeared\nposthumously; and in 1910 part 2 was published, as well as Olha\nHahn\u2019s thesis director Adolph St\u00f6hr\u2019s Lehrbuch\nder Logik in Psychologisiender Darstellung (see Cat 2019 for\ndetails and references).\n\nNeurath published four papers, one with Hahn (Neurath 1909a, 1909b and\n1910a, and Hahn and Neurath 1909). Hahn separately published two\nothers, the second submitted as her doctoral thesis (Hahn 1909 and\n1910).In the joint paper, Hahn and Neurath proved the dependence of\nthe principle of duality on the algebraic complementarity of domains\nof objects to which symbols and operations are applied.\nNeurath\u2019s own three papers addressed mainly\nSchr\u00f6der\u2019s symbolic relation of equality and the property\nof commutativity of operations sum and product over symbols standing\nfor classes of objects. It included a classification of applications\nof symbolic equalities and a discussion of univocality, or\ndeterminateness, noting its fundamental role in Schr\u00f6der\u2019s\nsystem and following the positivist philosopher Joseph\nPetzoldt\u2019s discussion of causality, determinism and the\ninterpretation of equality signs in mathematical equations. Neurath\ndistinguished between (quantitative) equality, definitional equality\nand symbolic equality (Neurath 1910a). with the notational dimension\nof the latter equality and the lack of cognitive significance Neurath\nassociated with differences in symbolic expression, his linguistic\nperspective differed markedly from Frege\u2019s. Besides attention to\nthe relativity of notational convention, the significance of the\ncommutation law was, according to Neurath, relative to the axiomatic\nsystem (echoing Poincar\u00e9\u2019s conventionalist treatment of\ngeometry).\n\nThe issues Neurath addressed resonated with ongoing philosophical\ndebates over equality in mathematical equations, identity,\ndefinitions, analyticity, axiomatization and conceptual analysis. In\naddition to the theme of univocality, a second enduring theme that\nappeared first in the logic writings was the semiotic, or notational,\nand typographic approach to the conventional introduction and\norganization of symbols, especially the linear, one-dimensional\ncharacter of typographic arrangements. The ideas and perspectives he\ndeveloped in the logic writings played a role in his subsequent\ndiscussions of economics, decision-making, scientific theorizing\nthrough combinatorial classifications and the epistemological and\nmethodological contributions to logical empiricism.\n\nFor instance, he cast the scientific character of political economy in\nterms of a modal criterion according to which true science consists in\nsystematically examining all possible cases and historical methods\nprovided a laboratory for the exploration of such possibilities\n(Neurath 1910b, 277). Moreover, this scientific character was also\nexpressed by the aims of systematicity, rationality and exactness, but\nnot quantitative measurability. Exact relations, he declared, were\npossible between non-measurable quantities. Such qualitative\nmeasurements involved logical (and topological) relations such as the\nordinal standard based on the algebraic relation of inequality\n(ibid.). Poincar\u00e9 had introduced the same ordering relations\nbetween \u2019non-measurable quantities\u2019 such as Gustav\nFechner\u2019s psycho-physical sensations to draw attention to the\ngap between the phenomenological and mathematical ideas of the spatial\ncontinuum (Poincar\u00e9 1906, 28; Turk 2018). Neurath, following\nalso Poincar\u00e9 and Fechner by analogy with the case of\nsubjective utility measures, applied this approach to study of the\nlimitations in the method of determination of decisions over\ncollective distributions of satisfaction based on aggregations of\nindividual attributions (Uebel 2004, 37 and Turk 2018, 136).\nComparisons between individual pleasure attributions for the same\nindividual or the same object did not determine the comparative order\nbetween aggregations: for individuals a and b and objects a and b, we\nmay have determined (Aa)>(Ab) and (Ba)>(Bb), and yet,\n(Aa)+(Bb)?(Ab)+(Ba) (Neurath 1912/1973, 115). Methodological and\nepistemological consequences for the formulation of logical empiricist\nincluded acknowledging the technical formal contributions to modern\nscience protecting it from metaphysics and meaninglessness, a role\ncaptured by the term \u2019logical empiricism,\u2019 while\nacknowledging only a limited value for the empirical application\nformal logical standard (with the risk of pseudorationalism),\ndefending syntacticism about language and unification only through a\nuniversal mixed jargon and local logical systematization.\n3.3 Scientific and linguistic epistemology\n\nKant had delivered the latest grand attempt to address the relation\nbetween science and philosophy, by taking the former to provide\nobjective empirical knowledge (exact, universal and necessary) and\ngiving to the latter knowledge the task of laying out the conditions\nof intelligibility and possibility of such knowledge as the sole,\ncritical scope of metaphysics and legitimate exercise of reason.\nKant\u2019s standard of a priori, an expression of\nrationality, was challenged and relativized by the Frege, Russell and\nWhitehead\u2019s notions of mathematical numbers grounded in logic\nand by the new notions of space and time in Einstein\u2019s\nrelativity theories. Neither mathematics was synthetic, nor physics\nseemed a priori; and the synthetic a priori was dismissed as\nempty of content in the new scientific landscape.\n\nWith the scientific world-conception, logical empiricists followed in\nthe footsteps and Helmholtz and Mach and considered a new post-Kantian\nproblematic: investigating the possibility of objective empirical\nknowledge with a role for intellectual construction without\nuniversality or necessity, neither Kantian apriorism nor radical\npositivism. Logic, with scientific status linked to technical\nsymbolism and the possibility of mathematics, was the sole last refuge\nfor philosophy. The new problematic suggested a demarcation project\nwith two inseparable tasks that were both descriptive and normative: a\npositive, unifying task to establish and promote the marks of\nscientific knowledge and the negative task to distinguish it from\nphilosophy.\n\nThe a priori kind of knowledge claims expressed in exact\ntheory was circumscribed to the analytic, voided of universality and\nnecessity and deflated by Schlick and Reichenbach to the character of\ndefinitions and conventions (following Poincar\u00e9). The synthetic\nkind of knowledge claim was exclusively a posteriori,\ngrounded in experience. The dominating, and later popularized,\nposition was that revisable theoretical scientific statements should\nstand in appropriate logical relations to unrevisable statements about\nelementary observations (data), called \u2018control sentences\u2019\nor \u2018protocol sentences\u2019. Such relations would provide\ntheoretical terms with cognitive meaning or sense, and theoretical\nstatements with verification. The form, role and status of protocol\nstatements thus became the topic of an important philosophical debate\nin the early 1930s involving logical-empiricist philosophers such as\nCarnap, Moritz Schlick, Edgar Zilsel and Otto Neurath, and others such\nas Karl Popper. At stake in the debate was precisely the very\narticulation of a philosophy of scientific knowledge, hence its\nimportance and also the diversity of positions that animated it.\n\nThe philosophical discussion that developed around the members of the\nVienna Circle was associated with the formulation of logical\nempiricism and the banner of \u2018unity of science against\nmetaphysics\u2019, but it cannot be adequately understood without\ntaking into account the diversity of evolving projects it\naccommodated. Carnap (much influenced by the neo-Kantian tradition,\nEinstein\u2019s theories of relativity, Husserl\u2019s\nphenomenology, Frege\u2019s logic and, i.e., Hilbertian axiomatic\napproach to mathematics as well as Russell\u2019s own logicism and\nhis philosophical project of logical constructions) was concerned with\nthe conditions of the possibility of objective knowledge, which he\nconsidered especially manifest in the formal exactness of scientific\nclaims (Carnap 1928). Schlick (inspired by turn-of-the-century French\nconventionalists such as Rey, Duhem and Poincar\u00e9,\nWittgenstein\u2019s philosophy of representation of facts, as well as\nEinstein\u2019s relativity theories and Hilbert\u2019s implicit\ndefinitions and axiomatic approach to mathematics) was interested in\nthe meaning of terms in which actual scientific knowledge of reality\nis expressed, as well as its foundation on true and certain beliefs\nabout reality (Schlick 1918, 1934). Neurath (influenced by Mach,\nvarieties of French conventionalism, especially Duhem\u2019s, and\nMarxism) sought to explore the empirical and historical conditions of\nscientific practice in both the natural and social sciences (Neurath\n1931/1973, 1932a/1983). Outside the Vienna Circle, Popper (influenced\nby Hume, Kant and Austrian child psychology) was interested in\naddressing the logical and normative issues of justification and\ndemarcation of objective and empirical scientific knowledge, without\nrelying on descriptive discussions of the psychology of subjective\nexperience and meaning (Popper 1935/1951). \n\nThe linguistic turn framed the examination of the controversial role\nof experience. In that respect the discussions of protocol sentences,\nthe so-called protocol sentence debate, addressed their linguistic\ncharacteristics and their epistemological status (Uebel 1992). It was\nanother dimension of their examination of both the source of human\nknowledge and the rejection of metaphysics as nonsense\u2014often\ndangerous nonsense (Carnap, Hahn and Neurath 1929/1973, and Stadler\n2007).\n\nIn his classic work Der Logische Aufbau der Welt (1928)\n(known as the Aufbau and translated as The Logical\nStructure of the World), Carnap investigated the logical\n\u2018construction\u2019 of objects of inter-subjective knowledge\nout of the simplest starting point or basic types of fundamental\nentities (Russell had urged in his late solution to the problem of the\nexternal world to substitute logical constructions for inferred\nentities). He introduced several possible domains of objects, one of\nwhich being the psychological objects of private sense\nexperience\u2014analysed as \u2018elementary experiences\u2019.\nThese provided the simplest but also the \u2018natural starting point\nin the epistemic order of objects\u2019. This specific construction\ncaptures the fact that knowledge is someone\u2019s private knowledge,\nwhile it raises Carnap\u2019s (and Kant\u2019s) main problem,\nnamely, how then objective knowledge is possible. In the\nAufbau and especially in Pseudoproblems in\nPhilosophy, also here the inclusion of terms and statements in\nthe system of science by this method was intended to exclude all\nnonsensical speculative statements. It provided a verification\ncriterion not only of testing but also of cognitive significance, or\nmeaning. Carnap stated in that vein that \u2018science is a system of\nstatements based on direct experience\u2019 (Carnap 1932/1934).\n\nIn spite of the range of alternatives considered, the\nAufbau\u2019s main focus on an empiricist, or\nphenomenological, model of knowledge in terms of the immediate\nexperiential basis was quickly understood by fellow members of the\nVienna Circle as manifesting three philosophical positions:\nreductionism, atomism and foundationalism.\nReductionism took one set of terms to be fundamental or\nprimitive; the rest would be logically connected to them. The\nobjectivity, rationality and empirical content and justification of\nscientific knowledge depended on the resulting vertical integration.\nAtomism, especially in Neurath\u2019s reading, was manifest\nsemantically and syntactically: semantically, in the analyzability of\na term; syntactically or structurally, in the elementary structure of\nprotocols in terms of a single experiential term\u2014\u2018red\ncircle here now\u2019\u2014; it also appeared in the possibility of\nan individual testing relation of a theoretical statement to one of\nmore experiential statements. Note that this version of atomism\ndiffers from the atomistic positivism about the form of elementary\nexperience that Carnap attributed to Mach, in contrast with his own,\nscientifically updated and preferred Gestalt-doctrine of a\nunified field of experience at a given time. The \u2018atomic\u2019\nconcepts of the experiential basis are the result of a\n\u2018quasi-analysis\u2019.\n\nFoundationalism, in the Cartesian tradition of secure basis,\ntook the beliefs in these terms held by the subject to be infallible,\nor not requiring verification, as well as the sole empirical source of\nepistemic warrant\u2014or credibility\u2014for all other beliefs.\nDescartes\u2019s foundationalism is based on a priori\nknowledge; Carnap\u2019s presentation of the empirical basis\ninstantiates a more modest version. Still a controversial issue among\nCarnap scholars, Carnap\u2019s kind of foundationalism would be\ncharacterized within one structure as a relation to its basis rather\nthan foundationalism, as in Hume or Descartes, regarding one\nprivileged basis over others. In 1932 Carnap acknowledged that he had\nadopted a \u2018refined form of absolutism of the\nur-sentence (\u201celementary sentence\u201d, \u201catomic\nsentence\u201d)\u2019 (1932/1987, 469).\n\nNeurath first confronted Carnap on yet another alleged feature of his\nsystem, namely, subjectivism. He immediately rejected Carnap\u2019s\nproposals on the grounds that if the language and the system of\nstatements that constitute scientific knowledge are intersubjective,\nthen phenomenalist talk of immediate subjective, private experiences\nshould have no place. More generally, Neurath offered a private\nlanguage argument to the effect that languages are necessarily\nintersubjective. In order to use experience reports to test and verify\neven one individual\u2019s own beliefs over time, private\ninstantaneous statements of the form \u2018red here now\u2019 will\nnot do. To replace Carnap\u2019s phenomenalist language Neurath\nintroduced in 1931 the language of physicalism (Neurath 1931/1983 and\n1932a/1983). This is the controversial Thesis of Physicalism:\nthe unity, intelligibility and objectivity of science rests on\nstatements in a language of public things, events and processes in\nspace and time \u2014including behavior and physiological events,\nhence not necessarily in the technical terms of physical theory. While\ninspired by materialism, for Neurath this was a methodological and\nlinguistic rule, and not an ontological thesis. (As is the case in\nCarnap\u2019s methodological solipsism, given Neurath\u2019s\nanti-metaphysical attitude it would not have been meant as an\nexpression of an objectivist metaphysics in the form of either\nmaterialism or social idealism). That physicalism was to avoid\nmetaphysical connotations can be seen further in that, in the spirit\nof Carnap\u2019s Thesis of Metalogic, its linguistic nature\nwas also central to its applications:\n\n\nstatements are compared with statements, certainly not with some\n\u201creality\u201d, nor with \u201cthings\u201d, as the Vienna\nCircle also thought up until now. (Neurath 1931/1983, 53)\n\n\nFollowing Neurath, Carnap explicitly opposed to the language of\nexperience a narrower conception of intersubjective physicalist\nlanguage which was to be found in the exact quantitative determination\nof physics-language realized in the readings of measurement\ninstruments. Remember that for Carnap only the structural or formal\nfeatures, in this case, of exact mathematical relations (manifested in\nthe topological and metric characteristics of scales), can guarantee\nobjectivity. Now the unity, objectivity and cognitive significance of\nscience rested on the universal possibility of the translation of any\nscientific statement into physical language\u2014which in the long\nrun might lead to the reduction of all scientific knowledge to the\nlaws and concepts of physics.\n\nNeurath responded with a new doctrine of protocol statements that\nconsidered their distinctive linguistic form, contents and\nmethodological status (Neurath 1932b/1983). This doctrine was meant to\nexplicate the idea of scientific evidence in the framework of\nempiricism, and it did so by specifying conditions of acceptance of a\nstatement as empirical scientific evidence. It was meant also to\ncircumvent the pitfalls of the alleged subjectivism, atomism,\nreductionism and foundationalism attributed to Carnap\u2019s earlier\ndiscussion of the experiential constitution, or construction system of\nconcepts and knowledge. Neurath\u2019s informal but paradigmatic\nexample of a protocol was:\n\n\nOtto\u2019s protocol at 3:17 o\u2019clock: [Otto\u2019s\nspeech-thinking at 3:16 was: (at 3:15 o\u2019clock there was a table\nin the room perceived by Otto)].\n\n\nFar from Carnap\u2019s atomic sort of protocol statements,\nNeurath\u2019s model manifested a distinctive complexity of terms and\nstructure (\u201caggregations\u201d). The protocol contains a\nfactual physicalist core in terms about the table and its location. It\nalso contains the experiential term that provides the linguistic\nrecording of the empirical character of protocols, that is, their\nexperiential origin. Neurath was mindful to caution here that\nperception terms only admitted physicalistic meaning in terms, for\ninstance, of physiological mechanisms of perception. It also contains\nthe declarative level, marked with \u2018Otto says\u2019, which\ndistinguishes the protocol as a linguistic statement. Neurath\ninsisted, again, that the statement had a dual nature, linguistic\n(propositional and communicative) and physicalist in the form of a\nphysical and physiological process. Finally, the other distinctive\nelements were the name of the protocolist and the times and locations\nof the experience and the reports, which provided an intersubjective ,\nphysicalist, public alternative to Carnap\u2019s subjective\n\u2018I see a red circle here now\u2019.\n(Note, however, that for Carnap, the idea of self itself is a\nconstituted concept.)\n\nThe general attention to language turned the project of logical\nempiricism into the problem of the acceptable universal language.\nScience must be characterized by its proper scientific language.\nNeurath\u2019s plan was for a unified science against metaphysics,\nand this involved a plan to police the proper unifying,\nmetaphysics-free language. The negative track of the plan was\neffectively carried out by the development and adoption of a list of\n\u2018dangerous terms\u2019, which he sometimes referred to,\nsemi-jokingly, as an index verborum prohibitorum: a list of\nforbidden terms such as \u2018I\u2019, \u2018ego\u2019,\n\u2018substance\u2019, etc. (Neurath 1933, Neurath 1940/1984, 217).\nThe positive track was the adoption of the universal language of\nphysicalism: \u2018metaphysical terms\ndivide\u2014scientific terms unite\u2019 (1935, 23,\norig. ital.).\n\nUnlike Carnap\u2019s ideal of basic statement, whether protocol or\nphysicalist, Neurath\u2019s protocols were not \u2018clean\u2019,\nprecise or pure in their terms. For Neurath physicalist language, and\nhence science in turn, is inseparable from ordinary language of any\ntime and place. In particular, it is muddled with imprecise,\nunanalyzed, cluster-like terms (Ballungen) that appear\nespecially in the protocols: the name of the protocolist,\n\u2018seeing\u2019, \u2018microscope\u2019, etc. They were often\nto be further analyzed into more precise terms or mathematical\nco-ordinations, but they often would not be eliminated. Even the\nempirical character of protocol statements could not be pure and\nprimitive, as physicalism allowed the introduction of\ntheoretical\u2014non-perception\u2014terms. Carnap himself, in\nThe Logical Syntax of Language (1934), declared the\ndistinction between analytic and synthetic (protocol-based) statements\narbitrary. Physicalism, and thus unified science, were based on a\nuniversal \u2018jargon\u2019.\n\nThe empirical genealogy expressed by protocols was the linguistic\nexpression of empiricism that identified protocol statements as\nepistemological special units in the system of statements that would\nconstitute objective scientific knowledge. This was Neurath\u2019s\nattempt to express the empiricist sentiment also behind Carnap\u2019s\nappeal to experience. A difference from Carnap\u2019s model of\nprotocol appears in the second aspect of their empiricist character,\ntheir testing function.\n\nNeurath\u2019s protocols didn\u2019t have the atomic structure and\nthe atomic testing role of Carnap\u2019s. Their methodological role\nreflected Duhem\u2019s holism: hypotheses are not tested\nindividually; only clusters of statements confront empirical data. But\ntheir methodological value in the testing of other statements\ndidn\u2019t make them unrevisable. This is Neurath\u2019s\nanti-foundationalism: Insofar as they were genuinely\nscientific statements, consistency with the spirit that opposed\nscience to dogmatic speculation and, no less importantly, opposed\nnaturalistic attention to actual practice, required that protocols too\nbe testable. This is the so-called Neurath Principle: in the\nface of conflict between a protocol and theoretical statements, the\ncancellation of a protocol statement is a methodological possibility\nas well (Neurath 1932b/1983, 95, Haller 1982). The role of\nindeterminacy in the protocol language points to a distinction between\na special Neurath Principle and a general Neurath\nPrinciple (Cartwright et al. 1996, 202\u20136). In the\nformer, and earlier, Neurath assumed a determinate logical relation of\ninconsistency. In the latter, subsequent version, the scope of\nrelations between hypotheses and protocol statements extended to\nindeterminate relations such that the principle behind the epistemic\nstatus of protocol statements is simply grounded on the voluntarisitic\nand conventionalist doctrine that \u2018[a]ll content statements of\nscience, and also their protocol statements that are used for\nverification, are selected on the basis of decisions and can be\naltered in principle\u2019 (Neurath 1934/1983, 102). Carnap adopted a\nsimilar conventionalist and pragmatic attitude in \u2018On Protocol\nSentences\u2019 (1932/1987) and in Logical Syntax (1934).\nThe complex structure of the explicitly laid out protocol would serve,\nin the holistic Duhemian spirit, the purpose of testing it by making\nexplicit as many circumstances as possible which are relevant to the\nexperience, especially as sources of its fallibility (was Otto\nhallucinating? were all the parts of the experimental instrument\nworking reliably? etc.). Neurath\u2019s dictum was meant to do\njustice to actual scientific practice with regard to the role of\nexperimental data.\n\nThis problematic was only made more challenging by the presence of\nBallung-type terms. The method of testing could not be\ncarried out in a logically precise, determinate and conclusive manner,\nexpecting calculability, determinism, omniscience and certainty, as\nthe prevailing ideal of rationality required (Neurath 1913/1983,\nNeurath 1934/1983 and Cat 1995). Protocol sentences, by virtue of\nperception terms, could provide certain stability in the permanence of\ninformation necessary for the generation of new expressions. But\nmethodologically they could only bolster or shake our confidence. To\nacknowledge these limitations is a mark of proper\nrationality\u2014which he opposed to pseudorationality. A\nloose coherentist view of justification and unification is the only\nlogical criterion available: \u2018a statement is called correct if\nit can be incorporated in this totality\u2019 of \u2018existing\nstatements that have already been harmonized with each other\u2019\n(Neurath 1931/1984, 66). Reasons underdetermine our actions and thus\npragmatic extra-logical factors are required to make decisions about\nwhat hypotheses to accept. Thinking requires provisional rules, or\nauxiliary motives, that fix a conclusion by decision (Neurath\n1913/1983). Scientific rationality is situated, contextually\nconstrained by, practical rationality. The system of knowledge is\nconstrained by historically, methodologically and theoretically\naccepted terms and beliefs, with limited stability, and cannot be\nrebuilt on pure, secure, infallible empirical foundations. This is the\nanti-Cartesian naturalism, non-foundationalism, fallibilism and holism\nof Neurath\u2019s model. This is also the basis for its corresponding\nconventionalist, constructivist normativity (Uebel 1996 and 2007 and\nCartwright et al. 1996). Without the conventions there is no\npossibility of rationality or objectivity of knowledge. Neurath\ncaptured the main features of his doctrine of scientific knowledge in\nthe image of a boat:\n\n\nThere is no way to establish fully secured, neat protocol statements\nas starting points of the sciences. There is no tabula rasa.\nWe are like sailors who have to rebuild their ship on the open sea,\nwithout ever being able to dismantle it in dry-dock and reconstruct it\nfrom its best components. Only metaphysics can disappear without a\ntrace. Imprecise \u2018verbal clusters\u2019 [Ballungen]\nare somehow always part of the ship. If imprecision is diminished at\none place, it may well re-appear at another place to a stronger\ndegree. (Neurath 1932b/1983, 92)\n\n\nBy 1934, the year of the completion of his Logic of Scientific\nDiscovery (Logik der Forschung), Popper had adopted an\napproach to scientific knowledge based on the logic of method, not on\nmeaning, so that any talk of individual experience would have no\nlinguistic expression (Popper 1935/1951). He unfairly criticized\nNeurath and also Carnap for allowing with such expressions the\nintroduction of psychologism in a theory of knowledge. For Popper a\ntheory of scientific knowledge was to be not a subjective or\ndescriptive account, but a normative logic of justification and\ndemarcation. He also criticized Neurath\u2019s antifoundationalism\nabout protocols as a form of anti-empiricism that merely opened the\ndoor to dogmatism or arbitrariness.\n\nInstead of protocols, Popper proposed to speak about basic\nstatements\u2014a term more attuned to their logical and functional\nrole. They are basic relative to a theory under test. Their empirical\ncharacter would invisibly reside in the requirement that basic\nstatements be singular existential ones describing material objects in\nspace and time\u2014much like Neurath\u2019s physicalism\u2014which\nwould be observable, in a further unspecified logical not\npsychological sense. Their components would not themselves be purely\nempirical terms since many would be understood in terms of\ndispositional properties, which, in turn, involved reference to\nlaw-like generalizations. But their \u2018basic\u2019 role was\nmethodological \u2018with no direct function of demarcation from\nmetaphysics in terms of meaning, sense or cognitive\nsignificance\u2019 and only provisional. They would be brought to\nmethodological use for the purpose of falsifying theories and\nhypotheses \u2018individually and conclusively\u2019 only once they\nwere conventionally and communally accepted by decision in order to\nstop infinite regress and further theoretical research.\n\nBut such acceptance, much as in Neurath\u2019s model, could be in\nprinciple revoked. It is a contingent fact that scientists will stop\nat easily testable statements simply because it will be easier to\nreach an agreement. It is important that basic statements satisfy\nexplicit conditions of testability or else they could not be rightful\npart of science. Popper could offer no rational theory of their\nacceptance on pain of having to have recourse to theories of\npsychology of perception and thereby weakening his normative criterion\nof demarcation. In his view, his method, unlike Neurath\u2019s,\ndidn\u2019t lead to either arbitrariness or dogmatism or the\nabandonment of empiricism. As he had argued against Spengler in 1921,\nhistorical contingency provides the rich constraints that establish\ncommunities and communication and the possibility of knowledge and, in\nthis holistic form, preclude radical relativism in practice; in\nhistorically situated practice, inherited or constructed stable\nArchimedean points always come into place; there is no tabula\nrasa (Neurath 1921/1973). Neurath rejected Popper\u2019s\napproach for its stealth empiricism and its pseudorationalism: its\nmisplaced emphasis on and faith in the normative uniqueness, precision\nand conclusiveness of a logical method\u2014at the expense of its own\nlimitations and pragmatic character (Zolo 1989, Cat 1995, Hacohen\n2000).\n\nFinally, the most radical empiricist attitude toward protocol\nsentences within the Vienna Circle came from Schlick. Schlick\nendorsed, following Hilbert, a formal, structural notion of\ncommunicable, objective knowledge and meaning as well as a\ncorrespondence theory of truth. His realism opposed Neurath\u2019s\ncoherentism, and also the pragmatism and conventionalism of\nCarnap\u2019s Principle of Tolerance in logical matters as\nwell as his Thesis of Metalogic. But like Carnap\u2019s latter thesis\nand his syntactic approach of 1934, Schlick was concerned with both\nthe Cartesian ideal of foundational certainty and Wittgenstein\u2019s\nmetalinguistic problem of how language represents the reality it is\nabout; such relation could only be shown, not said. In 1934 Schlick\nproposed to treat the claims motivating protocol statements, left by\nNeurath with the status of little more than mere hypotheses, as key to\nthe foundation of knowledge. They would be physicalistic statements\nthat, albeit being fallible, could be subjectively linked to\nstatements about immediate private experiences of reality such as\n\u2018blue here now\u2019 he called affirmations\n(Konstatierungen) (Schlick 1934). Affirmations carried\ncertainty and elucidated what could be showed but not said, they\nprovided the elusive confrontation or correspondence between\ntheoretical propositions and facts of reality. In this sense they\nafforded, according to Schlick, the fixed starting points and\nfoundation of all knowledge. But the foundation raised a psychological\nand semantic problem about the acceptance of a protocol. Affirmations,\nas acts of verification or giving meaning, lacked logical inferential\nforce; in Schlick\u2019s words, they \u2018do not occur within\nscience itself, and can neither be derived from scientific\npropositions, nor the latter from them\u2019 (Schlick 1934, 95).\nSchlick\u2019s empiricism regarding the role of protocol sentences\nsuggests but does not support strong epistemological foundationalism.\nSchlick\u2019s occasional references to a correspondence theory of\ntruth were just as unacceptable and were felt to be even more of a\nphilosophical betrayal within the framework of empiricism.\nPredictably, Neurath rejected Schlick\u2019s doctrines as\nmetaphysical, manifesting the pseudorationalist attitude (Neurath\n1934/1983).\n",
