    "main_text": "Ethics, Law, and Politics\n8. Conclusion\n\n\nAlthough the conceptual terrain of life concepts is well covered,\nthere is no accepted view as yet. This is unlikely to change given the\ndisciplinary backgrounds, explanatory values, and theoretical\ncommitments of the stakeholders involved. A wide range of practices\nrely on competing conceptions of life: including artificial life,\norigins-of-life research, the search for life, and other projects\ndescribed above.\nFuture scientific discoveries or inventions may break this impasse,\nas they have in other cases of theoretical gridlock. The development of\natomic theory, discussed in section 2, created new categorical\ndivisions that scientists accepted as more real than the categories of\nthe ancients or alchemists. With this conceptual fragmentation, old\ncategories were discarded and new ones accepted. One can imagine\nsomething similar happening in the case of life: many discoveries might show\na clear cluster of how complex, lifelike entities can form from\nprebiotic chemistry, eventually winning over the majority of the\nscientific and philosophical community (e.g. Weber 2007, 2010).\nConversely, a simple decision might be made based on shared values\nor explanatory goals. The example of death may be illustrative. After\ndecades of debate, a new decision, not a discovery, was made.\nPhysicians concluded the irreversibility of death was the most\nimportant property for their purposes. They adopted the concept of\nwhole-brain death as their operational criterion (DeGrazia 2016). The\nfacts on the ground did not change, but the shared understanding\ndid.\nFinally, perhaps life will be accepted as a polysemous concept with\neach definitional cluster applying to a subset of the whole:\nbiochemical life, evolutionary life, metabolic life, etc. Researchers\nmay rely on context, accept some miscommunication, or simply stipulate\nthe kind of life they mean. The example of planets, discussed in Brusse\n2016 may help make this point. There was always a huge diversity within\nthe category planet, which included the Sun and Moon until the\nRenaissance. In the early 1800s, asteroids were discovered. Initially,\nthey were considered planets, they were demoted to \u2018minor\u2019\nplanets a few decades later, then simply \u2018asteroids\u2019 after\nthe 1950s. Pluto was discovered in 1930, recognized as the smallest\nplanet by the 1970s. From 1992 until 2006, many objects similar to\nPluto were discovered until astronomers decided that the term planet\nactually covered at least two distinct, but scientifically interesting\ncategories: typical planets and dwarf planets. Similarly, perhaps some\nof the categories described in section 1.2 will form the basis of\naccepted sub-categories of life.\nIt is still an open question as to how long the current situation\nwill persist before a discovery forces a scientific reckoning or a\ndecision obviates the need. For now, the debate continues.\n",
