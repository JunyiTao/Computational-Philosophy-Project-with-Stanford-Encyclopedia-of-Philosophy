    "main_text": "Five grand theorems\n3. Five grand theorems\n\n\nThe five theorems reported in this section are in some sense the\npillars of classical model theory. All of them are theorems about\nfirst-order model theory. A great deal of the work done in the third\nquarter of the twentieth century was devoted to working out the\nconsequences of these theorems within first-order model theory, and the\nextent to which similar theorems hold for languages that are not\nfirst-order. \n3.1 The compactness theorem\nIf T is a first-order theory, and every finite subset of T\nhas a model, then T has a model.\n\n\nThere is a proof of this theorem in the entry on\n classical logic.\n The theorem has several\nuseful paraphrases. For example it is equivalent to the following\nstatement: \nSuppose T is a first-order theory and \u03c6 is a\nfirst-order sentence. If T\n \u22a8\n \u03c6\nthen there is a finite subset U of T such that U\n \u22a8\n \u03c6.\n\n\n(See the entry on\n model theory\n for the\nnotion\n \u22a8\n of model-theoretic\nconsequence. To derive the second statement from the first, note that\n\u2018T\n \u22a8\n \u03c6\u2019 is true if\nand only if there is no model of the theory T \u222a {\u00ac \u03c6}.) \n\n\nAnatolii Mal\u2019tsev first gave the compactness theorem in 1938 (for\nfirst-order logic of any signature), and used it in 1940/1 to prove\nseveral theorems about groups; this seems to have been the first\napplication of model theory within classical mathematics. Leon Henkin\nand Abraham Robinson independently rediscovered the theorem a few years\nlater and gave some further applications. The theorem fails badly for\nnearly all\n infinitary languages.\n3.2 The diagram lemma\n\n\nIf A is an L-structure, then we form the diagram of\nA as follows. First add to L a supply of new individual\nconstants to serve as names for all the elements of A. (This\nillustrates how in first-order model theory we easily find ourselves\nusing uncountable signatures. The \u2018symbols\u2019 in these\nsignatures are abstract set-theoretic objects, not marks on a page.)\nThen using L and these new constants, the diagram of\nA is the set of all the atomic sentences and negations of\natomic sentences that are true in A. \nIf B\u2032 is a model of the diagram of\nA, and B is B\u2032 with the new constants\nremoved from the signature, then there is an embedding of A\ninto B.\n\n\nNamely, if an element of A is named by a new constant\nc, then map that element to the element of B\u2032\nnamed c. A variant of this lemma is used in the proof of the\nelementary amalgamation theorem. \n3.3 The Lyndon interpolation theorem\n\n\nThis theorem may have the longest pedigree of any theorem of model\ntheory, since it generalises the Laws of Distribution for syllogisms,\nwhich go back at least to the early Renaissance. The theorem is\neasiest to state if we assume that our first-order languages have\nsymbols \u2227, \u2228 and \u00ac, but not \u2192 or \u21d4. Then an\noccurrence of a predicate symbol R in a formula \u03c6 is said to\nbe positive (resp. negative) if it lies within the\nscope of an even (resp. odd) number of occurrences of \u00ac. \nSuppose L and M are first-order languages, L \u222a M is the\nsmallest first-order language containing both L and M, and L \u2229 M is\nthe language consisting of all the formulas which are in both L and M.\nSuppose T is a theory in L, U is a theory in M, and no (L \u222a\nM)-structure is both a model of T and a model of U. Then there is a\nsentence \u03c6 of L \u2229 M which is true in all models of T and false\nin all models of U. (This sentence \u03c6 is called the\ninterpolant.) Moreover every predicate symbol with a positive\noccurrence in \u03c6 has a positive occurrence in some sentence of T and\na negative occurrence in some sentence of U, and conversely every\npredicate symbol with a negative occurrence in \u03c6 has a negative\noccurrence in some sentence of T and a positive occurrence in some\nsentence of U.\n\n\nThere are several proofs of this theorem, and not all of them are\nmodel-theoretic. Without the last sentence, the theorem is known as\nCraig\u2019s interpolation theorem, since William Craig proved this version\na few years before Roger Lyndon found the full statement in 1959. As\nCraig noted at the time, his interpolation theorem gives a neat proof\nof Evert Beth\u2019s definability theorem, which runs as follows. \n\n\nSuppose that L is a first-order language and M is the first-order\nlanguage got by adding to L a new predicate symbol R. Suppose also that\nT is a theory in M. We say that T implicitly defines R if it\nis false that there are two M-structures which are models of T, have\nthe same elements and interpret all the symbols of L in the same way\nbut interpret the symbol R differently. We say that T defines\nR explicitly if there is a formula\n\u03c6(x1,\u2026,xn)\nof L such that in every model of T, the formulas \u03c6 and\nR(x1,\u2026,xn) are\nsatisfied by exactly the same n-tuples\n(a1,\u2026,an) of\nelements. It is easy to see that if T defines R explicitly then it\ndefines R implicitly. (This fact is known as Padoa\u2019s method;\nPadoa used the failure of implicit definability as a way of proving the\nfailure of explicit definability.) Beth\u2019s theorem is the converse:\nSuppose that L, M, R and T are as above. If T defines R\nimplicitly then T defines R explicitly.\n3.4 The omitting types theorem\n\nThis theorem needs some preliminary definitions.  Suppose L is a\nfirst-order language, T is a complete theory in L, and \u03a6 is a set\nof formulas of L which all have the free variable x (and no\nother free variable).  We say that an\nL-structure A realises \u03a6 if there is an element\nof A that satisfies all the formulas in \u03a6; if A\nhas no such element, we say that A omits \u03a6.  A\nformula \u03c8(x) of L, with just the free\nvariable x, is called a support of \u03a6 in T if the\nconsequences of T include the sentence\n\u2203x\u03c8(x) and the sentence\n\u2200x(\u03c8(x) \u2192 \u03c6(x))\nwhenever \u03c6(x) is a formula in \u03a6.  It is not hard to\nsee that if there is a support of \u03a6 in T then every model of T\nrealises \u03a6.  The converse is not always true, but the omitting\ntypes theorem tells us that it is true if we restrict ourselves to\ncountable first-order languages:\n\nSuppose L is a first-order language which has countably\nmany formulas. Suppose T is a complete theory in L, and \u03a6 is a set\nof formulas of L which all have the free variable x. Finally\nsuppose that every model of T with just countably many elements\nrealises \u03a6. Then there is a support of \u03a6 in T. (In other\nwords, there is a finite reason why the \u2018type\u2019 \u03a6 can\u2019t\nbe omitted in any model of T.)\n\n\nThe omitting types theorem goes back to the mid 1950s. It very definitely\ndepends on the language being first-order and countable. It has several\nuseful generalisations, for example model-theoretic forcing,\nwhich is an analogue of the forcing construction in\n set theory.\n In fact the games used for\nmodel-theoretic forcing (see the entry on\n logic and games)\n can be adapted to prove the\nomitting types theorem too. There are similar but more complicated\ntheorems for uncountable first-order languages; some of these can be\nparaphrased as omitting types theorems for\n infinitary languages.\n3.5 The initial model theorem\n\n\nA quantifier-free formula is said to be a Horn formula (after\nAlfred Horn) if it has one of the three forms \n\n\u03c8,\n\u03c61 \u2227 \u2026 \u2227 \u03c6n\n\u2192 \u03c8,\n\u00ac(\u03c61 \u2227 \u2026  \u2227\n\u03c6n),\n\n\n\nwhere the formulas \u03c61, \u2026,\n\u03c6n, \u03c8 are all atomic. A universal Horn\nsentence (also known to the computer scientists as a Horn\nclause) is a sentence that consists of universal quantifiers\nfollowed by a quantifier-free Horn formula; it is said to be\nstrict if no negation sign occurs in it (i.e. if it doesn\u2019t\ncome from a quantifier-free Horn formula of the third kind). \nLet T be a theory consisting of strict universal Horn\nsentences. Then T has a model A with the property that for\nevery model B of T there is a unique homomorphism from\nA to B. (Such a model A is called an\ninitial model of T. It is unique up to\nisomorphism.)\n\n\nThis theorem is a generalisation, due to Mal\u2019tsev, of a group-theoretic\nconstruction called construction by generators and relations.\nIt is the main idea behind algebraic specification, which is\none approach to the specification of systems in computer science. The\nrequired behaviour of the system is written down as a set of strict\nuniversal Horn sentences, and then the initial model of these sentences\nis an abstract version of the required system. \n",
