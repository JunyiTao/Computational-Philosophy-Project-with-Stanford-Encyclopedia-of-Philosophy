    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nGilbert Ryle was born in Brighton, Sussex, England on 19 August 1900.\nOne of ten children, he came from a prosperous family and enjoyed a\nliberal and stimulating childhood and adolescence. His father was a\ngeneral practitioner but had keen interests in philosophy and\nastronomy that he passed on to his children and an impressive library\nwhere Ryle enjoyed being an \u201comnivorous reader\u201d (Ryle,\n1970, 1). Educated at Brighton College (where later in life he would\nreturn as a governor) Ryle went to Queen\u2019s College, Oxford in\n1919 initially to study Classics, but he was quickly drawn to\nPhilosophy, graduating in 1924 with first-class honours in the new\nModern Greats School of Philosophy, Politics and Economics. While not\nparticularly sporting, his undergraduate studies were relieved by\nrowing for his college eight, of which he was captain, and he was good\nenough to have trials for the University boat. After his graduation in\n1924 he was appointed to a lectureship in Philosophy at Christ Church\nCollege and a year later became tutor. He would remain at Oxford for\nhis entire academic career until his retirement in 1968; in 1945 he\nwas elected to the Waynflete Chair of Metaphysical Philosophy. With\nthe outbreak of war Ryle volunteered. He was commissioned in the Welsh\nGuards, serving in intelligence, and by the end of the War had been\npromoted to the rank of Major. He became the Editor of Mind\nafter G.E. Moore\u2019s retirement in 1947; a post he held until\n1971. Ryle was unstinting in his advice and encouragement to\ngenerations of students. With colleagues he was \u201ctolerant (and)\nuncensorious\u201d (Warnock, xiv), but in philosophical debate he\ncould turn into a formidable opponent, expressing an intense dislike\nof pomposity, pretence and jargon (Urmson, 271; Gallop, 228). He was\nalso ever ready to challenge both the excessive veneration paid by\nothers to Plato and Classical authors as well as the philosophical\npositions held by such contemporary colleagues as Collingwood in\nOxford or Anderson in Australia. He befriended Wittgenstein whose\nwork, if not his effect on colleagues and students, he greatly\nadmired. \u201cOutstandingly friendly (and) sociable\u201d (Warnock,\nxiv), he is remembered as an entertaining conversationalist. Despite\nhaving turned away from literary studies during his first year at\nOxford, sensing he had little aptitude for them, and even though he\nread little other than the novels of Jane Austen (about whom he wrote\nauthoritatively) and P. G. Wodehouse, the style of Ryle\u2019s\nwriting is often literary and instantly recognizable even after a few\nsentences (Urmson, 271; Mabbott, 223). A confirmed bachelor, he lived\nafter his retirement with his twin sister Mary in the Oxfordshire\nvillage of Islip. Gardening and walking gave him immense pleasure, as\ndid his pipe. He died on 6 October 1976 at Whitby in Yorkshire after a\nday\u2019s walking on the moors. \u201cPhilosophy irradiated his\nwhole life\u201d (Mabbott, 224). He is reputed to have said that the\nonly completed portrait of him made him look like a \u201cdrowned\nGerman General\u201d (Mabbott, 224).\n",
