    "main_text": "\n\nThe relationship between development and evolution has recently become\na lively debated topic among philosophers and biologists. This\ninterest has been increasingly stirred through at least four\ndevelopments since the 1990s: First, through new findings of the\nmolecular genetic mechanisms underlying the development and evolution\nof all morphological forms in multicellular organisms. This discovery\neventually led to the foundation of the new field of evolutionary\ndevelopmental biology (evo-devo). Second, the ability to rapidly\nsequence genes and genomes allowed genetic comparisons to be made\nbetween species. Prior to this, evolutionary genetics was confined to\nallelic differences within a species. Third, new discoveries of\nenvironmentally sensitive channels of extra-genetic transmission of\ninformation between organisms (e.g., epigenetic inheritance and\ntransmission of microbiota) led to attempts to more closely connect\ndevelopment and inheritance, and, as a consequence, evolution. Fourth,\nthe behavioral patterns developed by organisms are increasingly\ndiscussed not only as effects of adaptive processes, but as starting\npoint of evolutionary trajectories. This includes hypotheses\nconceptualizing organisms as agents that co-modify the selective\npressures effecting them (and other species). \n\nThese recent trends towards intertwining, rather than separating, the\nconcepts of development and evolution is in contrast to authoritative\nvoices in evolutionary biology (and to a substantial part in\nphilosophy of biology) during most of the twentieth century (see Sapp\n1983; Burian 2004; Amundson 2005). As a consequence of this tradition,\nthis new integration faces a number of conceptual and methodological\nchallenges. In this entry, the focus will be on debates associated\nwith the relationship between development and evolution. Other\ndiscussions about what each of the two components, development and\nevolution, are or how they are (or should be) conceptualized or\nstudied individually is only addressed when relevant to this main\ntopic. \n",
