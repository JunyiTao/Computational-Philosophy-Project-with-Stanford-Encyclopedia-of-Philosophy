    "main_text": "Inference\n5. Inference\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s contributions to understanding the\nknowledge source called \u201cinference,\u201d\nanum\u0101na, and \u201cinferential knolwedge,\u201d\nanumiti, come on top of a long history of advances both\nwithin Ny\u0101ya and outside, from Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Buddhist\nlogicians and epistemologists, in particular, but also others.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba was a great student of philosophy. Most of the\ntechnical system can be found in his near predecessor,\nMa\u1e47ika\u1e47\u1e6dha Mi\u015bra (1953), and discussions of\nfallacies echo the seventh-century Buddhist Dharmak\u012brti (1993)\nand others. However, his treatment of inference is, arguably, more\nelaborate than that of any predecessor, and, as is his ususal\npractice, he examines a host of similar definitions of key items, such\nas \u201cpervasion,\u201d as well as many opponent positions before\ndefending one or more of his own.\n\nConsidering the development of logic in the West, it important to keep\nin mind that inference throughout Ny\u0101ya is part of epistemology.\nSomething about the world is known by any veritable inference. An\ninference must have premises that are themselves known. Ny\u0101ya\nphilosophers do not distinguish between a formally valid deductive\nargument (which may or may not have false premises) and deductive\narguments that are \u201ccogent\u201d (with no unjustified premises\nand no errors).\n\nA set of logical terms is standard across Ny\u0101ya and most of the\nother classical schools, and Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba both uses them and\nprovides his own precise definitions:\n\n\n\npak\u1e63a\n(a) inferential subject; a mountain in a stock\nexample \n\ns\u0101dhana\n(\\(H\\)) prover (\u2018hetu\u2019 is a synonym);\nsmokiness \n\ns\u0101dhya\n (\\(S\\)) probandum, the property to be proved; fieriness\n\n\nvy\u0101pti\n \\(\\forall x (Hx \\to Sx)\\) inference-grounding pervasion;\n\n\u201cWherever smoke, there fire\u201d \n\n\n\nFor example, he characterizes an inferential subject,\npak\u1e63a (2020: 734):\n\n\nAn inferential subject (pak\u1e63a) occurs where there is no\nknowledge source that has positively established something in\nco\u00f6rdination with an absence of a desire to know. Thus, that is\nnot an inferential subject if there is a knowledge source that has\nalready positively established whatever and no desire to know\n(it by inference). \u2026 This is what it is to be an inferential\nsubject (as a factor in the generation of inferential knowledge).\nAdmittedly, this definition does not differentiate it from anything,\nsince to be an inferential subject is a property with universal scope\n(anything can be an inferential subject, qualities as well as\nsubstances, universals as well as particulars, and so on).\nNevertheless, the way the word \u201bpak\u1e63a\u2019 is\nused has been explained.\n\n\nA stock example of an inference:\n\n \\(Ha\\) (The mountain is smoky.)\n \\(\\forall x (Hx \\to Sx)\\) (Whatever is smoky is fiery.)\n \\(Sa\\) (The mountain is fiery.)\n\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba devotes several long sections of the chapter to\nissues surrounding the inductive support that inferential knowledge\npresumes, a basis for the proper formation of the inference-informing\nsa\u1e43sk\u0101ra or \u201cmental disposition\u201d\nresponsible for a subject\u2019s being able to remember (in a crucial\nmental event called \u201creflection,\u201d\npar\u0101mar\u015ba) a vy\u0101pti or inclusion of\nall things \\(H\\) as also things \\(S\\). This is the\n\u201cexample.\u201d\n\n\n\nd\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101nta\n\\(Hb,Sb\\) & \\(\\neg Hc, \\neg Sc\\) pervasion-supportive\nexample, a location known to possess both the prover and the probandum\n(a fiery kitchen hearth); also, a known absence of the prover where\nthere is a known absence of the probandum. \n\n\n\nInference-grounding \u201cpervasions,\u201d vy\u0101pti,\nare of different sorts, but they all obtain in nature, such as that\nbetween smokiness and fieriness. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba and all\nNaiy\u0101yikas are much occupied with pervasions, their nature and\nhow they are known.\n",
