    "main_text": "Experimental Philosophy and Intuitions || Experimental Philosophy and Skeptical Challenges\n4.3 Experimental Philosophy and Skeptical Challenges\n\nThe sources project is, as noted above, often presented as a possible\nmeans of justifying skepticism regarding some class of philosophical\nintuitions. An analogy suggested by Knobe and Nichols (2008) is to\ndebunking explanations of religious beliefs. Theorists engaged in such\nprojects argue that religious belief (or religious experience on which\nsuch belief is based) is produced by some questionable process such as\nwish fulfillment, desire for a father figure, cultural indoctrination,\netc. It is then argued (or assumed) that this fact about the source of\nthe belief (or its direct internal ground) undermines the epistemic\ncredentials of such beliefs.\n\nThis may suggest that some skeptical proponents of the sources project\naim to motivate an instance of the Argument from Unreliability\n (\u00a73.3).\n As an example, consider Greene\u2019s fMRI-based arguments (Greene\net al. 2001; Greene 2003, 2007) against certain\n\u201ccharacteristically deontological\u201d intuitions in ethics.\nThe primary experimental data on which his argument is based is the\nfact that portions of the brain independently implicated in emotional\nreaction are more active when subjects consider cases giving rise to\ncharacteristically deontological intuitions than when they consider\ncases giving rise to characteristically consequentialist intuitions.\nHowever, critics will allege\n (\u00a73.3)\n that attempts to show that a process is unreliable (independent of\ndisagreement) require independent access to the target domain and such\nintuition-independent access seems lacking for most of the target\ndomains of philosophical inquiry. In this vein, Berker (2009) argues\nthat the best argument in Greene\u2019s work rests largely on other\nintuitions about the general normative insignificance of the\nfactors within hypothetical cases to which Greene believes\ndeontological intuitions are responsive. (See Unger 1996 for an\nentirely a priori criticism of many \u201ccharacteristically\ndeontological\u201d intuitions for their apparent responsiveness to\nintuitively normatively insignificant factors.)\n\nThe aforementioned analogy to debunking explanations of religious\nbelief might also be taken to suggest a version of the Argument from\nLack of Explanatory Necessity\n (\u00a73.4.1).\n According to that argument, the provision of an explanation of the\noccurrence of the intuitions in question (the intuitings)\nwhich does not appeal to the truth of their contents (the\nintuiteds) undermines belief in their contents. The role of\nexperimental work might be thought to be to support the factual\npremise of that argument (see Greene 2003: 849 for such a suggestion).\nAs we have seen\n (\u00a73.4.2),\n critics will claim that the argument relies on a questionable\nnormative premise and violates the non-self-undermining constraint.\nThey may also suggest that the plausibility of the non-normative\npremise of the argument derives from very general armchair (perhaps\neven entirely a priori) reflections on the contents of the\nintuitions, their truth-makers, and the nature of explanation. If so,\nthen the experimental investigations are idle.\n\nSome proponents of the variation project present us empirical evidence\nof disagreement between intuitions in order to motivate a version of\nthe Argument from Intrasource Inconsistency\n (\u00a73.3.2).\n Some critics of skepticism motivated by the variation project claim,\ncontrary to what was suggested earlier\n (\u00a72.4),\n that intuitions are not treated as evidence or reasons in\nphilosophical inquiry (Deutsch 2015; Williamson 2007; Cappelen 2012).\nWhether such a maneuver really evades whatever skeptical implications\nfollow from disagreement depends on whether disagreements of belief\nare epistemologically less troubling than variations in non-doxastic\njustifiers.\n\nThough critical of the variation project, Sosa\u2019s suggests that\n\n\n\nthere will definitely be a prima facie problem for the appeal\nto intuitions in philosophy if surveys show that there is extensive\nenough disagreement on the subject matter supposedly open to intuitive\naccess. (Sosa 2007)\n\n\nRelevant to determining whether the antecedent of Sosa\u2019s\nconditional is satisfied are the methodological concerns about survey\nmethods noted above and their ability to support claims of\nintuition disagreement. Relevant to determining the\npossibility of the antecedent of Sosa\u2019s conditional being\nsatisfied are the distinctively a priori concerns raised\nabove\n (\u00a73.4.2)\n about the possible extent of disagreement, about how the existence of\nwidespread disagreement could be justifiably believed to exist\n (\u00a73.3.2),\n and, importantly, about the non-self-undermining constraint.\n",
