    "main_text": "Themes in feminist ethics || Intersectionality\n2.3 Intersectionality\n\nOne way that some philosophers offer to resolve the possible tension\nbetween conceptions of femininity and feminism is to bring\nintersectional approaches to the question as to whose femininity is\nbeing discussed. Concerns that femininity is antithetical to a\ncritical feminist perspective seem to presuppose a conception of\nfemininity as passive, gentle, obedient, emotional, and dependent, in\ncontrast with a conception of masculinity as its opposite. In a\nphilosophical tradition dominated by white and masculine philosophers,\ndescribing femininity as necessarily the opposite of one\u2019s\nconception of masculinity in a gender binary makes limited sense.\nScholars of intersectionality point out, however, that identities are\nnot binary: \u201cthe masculinity and femininity in play here are not\nracially unmarked (if only for the reason that gender is never\nracially unmarked)\u201d (James 2013, 752). The insights of\nphilosophers of Black Feminism, intersectionality, queer theory,\ncritical race theory, disability studies, and transfeminism, among\nothers, contribute to a view that there is no universal definition of\nfemininity or of the category of woman that neatly applies to all\nwomen. Some of these philosophers suggest that the distinctive moral\nand valuing experiences of women and individuals of all genders may be\nunjustly ignored or denied by a conception of women or femininity that\nturns out to be white, ableist, and cisgender (Crenshaw 1991; Collins\n1990; Wendell 1996; hooks 1992; Tremain 2000; Serano 2007; McKinnon\n2014). Intersectional approaches reject binaries such as\n\u201cmasculinity/femininity\u201d that tend to take the social\npositions of privileged people as generic. Minimally,\nintersectionality is \u201cthe predominant way of conceptualizing the\nrelation between systems of oppression which construct our multiple\nidentities and our social locations in hierarchies of power and\nprivilege,\u201d offering a remedy to histories of exclusions in\nfeminist theory (Carastathis 2014, 304).\n\nAlthough intersectional insights can be found in the works of writers\neven from the distant past, the predominance of intersectionality in\nfeminist ethics today is largely owed to Black feminists and critical\nrace theorists, who were the first to argue for the significance of\nintersectionality (Crenshaw 1989; Collins 1990; Gines 2014; Bailey\n2009). Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw describes intersectionality in\ndifferent senses: as an experience, an approach, and a problem\n(Crenshaw 1989; Crenshaw 1991). Crenshaw\u2019s description of\nintersectionality as an experience includes the phenomena of\noppressive practices and harms that occur at, and because of,\nintersections of aspects of identity. For example, when Black men, but\nnot any women, were permitted to work on a General Motors factory\nfloor, and white women, but not any Black persons, were permitted to\nwork in the General Motors secretarial pool, then Black women were\ndiscriminated against as Black women. That is, they were not permitted\nto have any job at General Motors due to living at an intersection of\ncategories of identity that are treated separately in the law\n(Crenshaw 1989). Crenshaw\u2019s description of intersectionality as\nan approach includes centering the lives and testimony of those whose\nexperiences with living at intersections of oppressions have been\nignored or denied in traditional philosophical and political theories\n(Crenshaw 1989; Crenshaw 1991; hooks 1984; Dotson 2014; Lorde 1990;\nLugones 1987; Lugones 2014). Crenshaw\u2019s description of\nintersectionality as a problem includes disrupting the traditional\noverlooking of Black women\u2019s experiences, and offering the\nexperiences and the approaches described above as challenges to the\ndoctrine that discrimination occurs only along one axis of identity\n(Crenshaw 1989, 141). Intersectionality is pursued in the interests of\nexpanding understandings of differences and accounting for the\nexperiences of people previously spoken for, if addressed at all,\nrather than consulted.\n\nNot all philosophers who embrace appreciation of the insights of\nintersectionality agree on whether it yields a distinct methodology,\nor a starting point for better inquiry, or a better conception of\nexperiences of oppression (Khader 2013; Garry 2011). Serene Khader\nsuggests that intersectional theories \u201care united by a critique\nof what Crenshaw (1991) calls \u2018additive\u2019 models of\nidentity\u201d that assume that individuals at intersections of\ntraditionally oppressed identity categories are \u201cnecessarily\nworse off than the individual facing a single oppression,\u201d as if\neach dimension on which one can be oppressed is easily separable in\ncategories traditionally conceived in isolation (Khader 2013, 75).\nInstead, \u201cintersectional theorists argue that the oppressions\nfacing multiply oppressed women co-constitute one another and situate\nthose women such that attempts to advance the interests of \u2018all\nwomen\u2019 may fail to advance theirs\u201d (Khader 2013, 75).\n\nIntersectionality is not without its critics in feminist ethics. For\nexample, Naomi Zack (2005) argues that an intersectional approach to\nconcepts such as that of woman successfully demonstrates\nproblems with essentialism with respect to women\u2019s natures, but\ndegrades the category of woman, \u201cmultiplying axes of analysis\nand thus gender categories beyond necessity\u201d (Bailey 2009, 21)\nto an extent that may thereby fragment attempts to advocate for women\n(Zack 2005; Ludvig 2006; Sengupta 2006). Some feminists who support\nintersectionality have responded to Zack\u2019s concerns by arguing\nthat everyday concepts such as woman include an array of\nidentities, including distinct gender identities that bear a family\nresemblance and include a range of manifestations (Garry 2011). Other\nfeminists have responded to Zack\u2019s concerns for feminist\nmovement or solidarity by arguing for the possibilities of working in\ncoalitions that do not require widely shared commonality, working to\nlearn from and about positions of difference, and cultivating more\nhumility and less arrogance in theorizing (Lorde 1984; Lugones 1987;\nReagon 2000; Bailey 2009; Carastathis 2014; Sheth 2014; Ru\u00edz\nand Dotson 2017). Other feminist ethicists raise tensions in\nintersectional theory that are not intended to undermine the approach\nbut to ask for elaboration of its details, including its very\ndefinition (Nash 2008). The appeal for these clarifications, however,\nmay reflect traditions that intersectionality is dedicated to\ndisrupting, since it is made in the context of the pursuit of\njustification, habits of opposition, and a narrow sense of\ndefinitional work that is typical in philosophy, a field that has a\nreputation for lacking appreciation for diverse practitioners (Dotson\n2013).\n",
