    "main_text": "Connections to logic and philosophy || Strict finitism\n4.6 Strict finitism\nThe most direct links between philosophy of mathematics and computational complexity theory have thus far arisen in the context of discussions of the view traditionally known as strict finitism. This view is most prominently associated with Yessenin-Volpin (1961; 1970), who is in turn best known for questioning whether expressions such as \\(10^{12}\\) or \\(2^{50}\\) denote natural numbers. Presuming that such expressions denote at all, Yessenin-Volpin contended that they cannot be taken to describe what he referred to as feasible numbers \u2013 i.e. numbers up to which we may count in practice. On this basis, he outlined a foundational program wherein feasibility is treated as a basic notion and traditional arguments in favor of the validity of mathematical induction and the uniqueness of the natural number series are called into question. Antecedents for such a view may be found in (e.g.) Bernays (1935), van Dantzig (1955), and Wang (1958).[48]\nRecall that one tenet of the traditional form of finitism associated with the Hilbert Program is that the natural numbers should not be conceived as comprising a completed infinite totality. Strict finitists are sometimes described as going one step further than this and actively denying that there are infinitely many natural numbers. However, the following are more characteristic of claims which such theorists explicitly endorse:\n\n(S1)\n\nIt is possible to identify a class of natural numbers corresponding to those which can be constructed in practice by counting or whose values are otherwise explicitly representable as numerals, either concretely or in intuition.\n(S2)\n\nWe possess notations \u2013 e.g. decimal numerals such as \\(10^{10^{10}}, 67^{257^{729}}, 10^{12}\\) \u2013 which do not denote numbers in this class.\n\nIn emphasizing the practical aspects of how we use numerals to represent natural numbers in the course of performing arithmetical computations, it is evident that the concerns which motivate strict finitism anticipate some of those which also inspired the development of complexity theory. Nonetheless, strict finitism has attracted few followers. To see why this is so, observe that (S1) makes clear that strict finitists propose to identify natural numbers with numerals such as the familiar sequence \\(0,0',0'',\\ldots\\) of unary numerals.\nIf we regard such expressions as tokens rather than types, then it makes sense to consider the task of concretely \u2018counting up to\u2019 a number by \nconstructing its unary representation in the sense described by Yessenin-Volpin.  For recall that it is a characteristic feature of numerals that they may be generated from certain initial symbols by the application of a finite set of syntactic formation rules \u2013 e.g. the unary numerals are generated by applying the formation rule \\(\\sigma \\mapsto \\sigma'\\) to the initial symbol \\(0\\). But once this is acknowledged, it also seems difficult to resist the following additional thesis:\n\n(S3)\n\nIf a numeral \\(\\sigma\\) can be feasibly constructed, then so can \\(\\sigma'\\) (i.e. the unary numeral denoting the successor of the number denoted by \\(\\sigma\\)).[49]\n\nIn attempting to accommodate (S1)\u2013(S3) simultaneously, we must confront a tension which has led many authors to follow Dummett (1975) in concluding that strict finitism lacks a coherent formulation. For suppose we let \\(F(x)\\) symbolize that \\(x\\) denotes a feasible number in Yessenin-Volpin\u2019s sense. Then it would seem to follow from (S1) that we ought to accept\n\n\\(F(0)\\)\n\nBut it would also seem to follow from (S3) that we should also accept\n\n\\(\\forall x(F(x) \\rightarrow F(x+1))\\)\n\nand from (S2) that we should accept\n\n\\(\\neg F(\\tau)\\)\n\nwhere \\(\\tau\\) is an expression denoting an \u2018infeasible number\u2019 such as  \\(10^{12}\\), \\(10^{10^{10}}\\) or \\(67^{257^{729}}\\).\nDummett observed that two different forms of the classical sorites paradox now intervene to show that (i)\u2013(iii) are inconsistent. For on the one hand, by applying mathematical induction \u2013 i.e. the principle that for all definite properties \\(P(x)\\) of natural numbers, we may infer \\(\\forall x P(x)\\) from \\(P(0)\\) and \\(\\forall x(P(x) \\rightarrow P(x+1))\\) \u2013 to the predicate \\(F(x)\\), we may conclude that \\(\\forall x F(x)\\) from (i) and (ii). But then \\(F(\\tau)\\) follows by universal instantiation, in contradiction to (iii). And on the other hand, even without appealing to induction, a contradiction can also be derived in the form of a conditional sorites argument by deriving \\(F(\\tau)\\) as the result of repeatedly applying modus ponens to the series \\(F(0), F(0) \\rightarrow F(0'), F(0') \\rightarrow F(0''), \\ldots\\) obtained from (ii) by universal instantiation.\nAlthough it would be uncharitable to think that Yessenin-Volpin was unaware of these observations, the first person to directly reply to the charge that (S1)-(S3) are inconsistent appears to have been Parikh (1971).[50] His response can be understood as consisting of two parts, both of which bear on the analysis of the informal notion of feasibility considered in Sections \n 1.1 and \n 2.2. \n On the one hand, Parikh considers what he refers to as the almost consistent theory \\(\\mathsf{PA}^F\\). This theory is formulated over the language \\(\\mathcal{L}_a \\cup \\{F(x)\\}\\) supplemented with terms for all closed primitive recursive functions and contains the statement \\(\\neg F(\\tau)\\) where \\(\\tau\\) is some fixed primitive recursive term intended to denote an \u2018infeasible\u2019 number such as \\(10^{12}\\). Finally, \\(\\mathsf{PA}^F\\) contains the axioms of \\(\\mathsf{PA}\\) with the induction schema restricted to formulas not containing \\(F(x)\\).\nIn light of the latter restriction, it is not possible to mimic the inductive form of the sorites argument in \\(\\mathsf{PA}^F\\). But of course \\(\\mathsf{PA}^F\\) is still inconsistent in virtue of the conditional form of the argument. Nonetheless, Parikh showed that for appropriate choices of \\(\\tau\\), any proof of a contradiction in \\(\\mathsf{PA}^F\\) must itself be very long.  For instance, if we consider the super-exponential function \\(2 \\Uparrow 0 = 1\\) and \\(2 \\Uparrow (x+1) = 2^{2 \\Uparrow x}\\) and let \\(\\tau\\) be the primitive recursive term \\(2 \\Uparrow 2^k\\), it is a consequence of Parikh\u2019s result that any proof of a contradiction in \\(\\mathsf{PA}^F\\) must be on the order of \\(2^k\\) steps long. For example if \\(\\tau = 2 \\Uparrow 2^{1000}\\), then such a proof must be at least \\(2^{1000}\\) lines \n long.[51] \nThis suggests the possibility of a two-part reply on behalf of the strict finitist to Dummett\u2019s argument against strict \n finitism:[52]\n\n\nThe inductive form of the sorites is ruled out in virtue of the fact that \\(F(x)\\) is not a definite (i.e. non-vague) property of natural numbers.\n\nAt least for certain choices of \\(\\tau\\), the conditional form is also not a threat because the only derivation of a contradiction from (i)\u2013(iii) is too long to be carried out in practice.\n\nThe possibility of such a reply notwithstanding, it is also natural to ask at this point whether the notion of feasibility considered in complexity theory might also be vague in a manner which could render it susceptible to the sort of soritical argument envisioned by Dummett (1975). Note, however, that our discussion thus far suggests that the notion of feasibility in which strict finitists have been interested is a property of individual natural numbers. This is out of keeping with the way we have seen that this notion is treated in complexity theory. For instance, in order to employ the Cobham-Edmond\u2019s Thesis to judge whether a problem \\(X\\) is feasibly decidable, we consider the order of growth of the time complexity \\(t(n)\\) of the most efficient algorithm for deciding \\(X\\). From the perspective of complexity theory, feasibility is thus a notion which applies not to individual natural numbers \\(n\\), but either to time complexity functions of type \\(\\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}\\) or their rates of growth.\nNext observe that the following are consequences of the Cobham-Edmonds thesis:\n\n\n\\(O(1)\\) (i.e. constant time) is a feasible rate of growth.\n\nSince all polynomial orders of growth are feasible, it follows that if \\(O(n^k)\\) is feasible, then so is \\(O(n^{k+1})\\).\n\nSuper-polynomial orders of growth such as \\(O(2^n)\\) are not feasible.\n\nOn this basis one might indeed fear that the intuitions about feasibly computable functions codified by the Cobham-Edmonds thesis exhibit the same kind of instability as do intuitively acceptable principles about feasibly constructible numbers.\nTo see that this is not the case, however, observe that we compare the growth rates of \\(f,g: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}\\) not by the standard ordering \\(\\lt\\) on the natural numbers but rather the following ordering \\(\\prec\\):\n\n\\[\n O(f(n)) \\prec O(g(n)) \\text{ if and only if there exists } \n n_0,c \\in \\mathbb{N} \\text{ such that for all } \n n \\gt n_0, f(n) \\lt c \\cdot g(n)\n\\]\n\nIt is a consequence of this definition that \\(O(1) \\prec O(n) \\prec O(n^2) \\prec O(n^3) \\ldots\\) \u2013 i.e. the polynomial orders of growth do form an \\(\\omega\\)-sequence with respect to \\(\\prec\\). However, it also follows that \\(O(n^k) \\prec O(2^n)\\) for all \\(k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) \u2013 i.e. \\(O(2^n)\\) is a \u2018point at infinity\u2019 sitting above each polynomial order of growth with respect to this ordering (as are all other super-polynomial rates of growth).[53] And from this it follows that such orders cannot be reached from below by a sorties-like sequence of feasible orders of growth \\(O(1) \\prec O(n) \\prec O(n^2) \\prec O(n^3) \\ldots\\) When analyzed according to the Cobham-Edmonds thesis, it hence appears that the \u2018naive\u2019 notion of feasible computability does not suffer from the sort of instability which Dummett takes to plague the notion of a feasibly constructible number.\nThese observations point to another theme within the writings of some strict finitists which suggests that they also anticipate the way in which predicates like \u2018feasible\u2019 and \u2018infeasible\u2019 are now employed in complexity theory. For instance, while van Dantzig (1955) suggests that the feasible numbers are closed under addition and multiplication, Yessenin-Volpin (1970) explicitly states that they should not be regarded as closed under exponentiation. The possibility that exponentiation should be understood to play a role in the formulation of strict finitism itself is also suggested by the fact that the particular examples of \u2018infeasible numbers\u2019 which have been put forth by Yessenin-Volpin and others have typically employed exponential or iterated exponential notations of the forms such as \\(n_1^{{n}_2}\\) or \\(n_1^{n_2^{n_3}}\\). This in turn suggests another reply to the sorties-based argument against strict finitism.\nRecall that the theory \\(\\text{I}\\Delta_0\\) introduced in \n Section 4.5 \n allows us to define the graph of the exponential function \\(x^y\\) via a \\(\\Delta_0\\)-formula \\(\\varepsilon(x,y,z)\\) in the sense that \\(\\text{I}\\Delta_0 \\vdash \\forall x\\varepsilon(x,0,1)\\) and \\(\\text{I}\\Delta_0 \\vdash \\forall x \\forall y \\forall z(\\varepsilon(x,y,z) \\rightarrow \\varepsilon(x,y+1,z \\cdot x))\\). But as we have seen, \\(\\text{I}\\Delta_0\\) does not prove the totality of the exponential function nor (as can be also be shown) does Buss\u2019s theory \\(\\mathsf{S}^1_2\\). From this it follows that the theory \\(\\mathsf{S}^1_2 + \\exists y \\neg \\exists z \\varepsilon(2,y,z)\\) is proof-theoretically consistent. By the completeness theorem for first-order logic, there thus exists a model \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) for the language of bounded of arithmetic such that \\(\\mathcal{M} \\models \\mathsf{S}^1_2 + \\exists y \\neg \\exists z \\varepsilon(2,y,z)\\). But although it follows from Theorem 4.5 that all the polynomial time computable functions are defined for all inputs in \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), there also exists an object \\(a\\) in the domain of \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) satisfying \\(\\neg \\exists z \\varepsilon(2,a,z)\\). And from this it follows that the expression we would conventionally write as \u2018\\(2^a\\)\u2019 fails to denote a value in \\(\\mathcal{M}\\).[54]\nOf course any model \\(\\mathcal{M} \\models \\mathsf{S}^1_2 + \\exists y \\neg \\exists z \\varepsilon(2,y,z)\\) must be nonstandard. Thus not only must the domain of \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) be infinite, but also there will exist \u2018natural numbers\u2019 in the sense of \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) which will have infinitely many predecessors when viewed from the outside of \\(\\mathcal{M}\\). One might thus at first think that the use of structures like \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) to explore the consequences of strict finitism would be antithetical to its proponents.\nNote, however, that such theorists are typically careful to avoid explicitly asserting that there are only finitely many feasible numbers. Instead they give examples of expressions whose denotations (were they to exist) would be infeasibly large \u2013 e.g. those given in the formulation of (S2). Certainly the claim that there is a largest feasibly constructible number would invite the challenge that the strict finitist nominate such a number \\(n\\). And any such nomination would in turn invite the rejoinder that if \\(n\\) is feasibly constructible, then \\(n+1\\) must be as well. But in the sort of model \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) under consideration the definite description \u2018the largest \\(x\\) such that \\(2^x\\) exists\u2019 will be non-denoting in virtue of the fact that the elements \\(n \\in \\mathcal{M}\\) such that \\(\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists z \\varepsilon(2,n,z)\\) form a proper initial segment. The existence of such models might thus be taken to elucidate Yessenin-Volpin\u2019s (1970) claim that there are distinct natural number sequences which are distinguished by the primitive recursive functions under which they are closed.[55]\n",
