Recent Areas of Study: The Brain and Human Behavior\n\nThe work in the previous sections has focused primarily on examples of\nfeminist perspectives in biology and the social sciences. This may not\nbe surprising since in much of biology, sex is relevant and thinking\nabout sex has been among the issues that feminists have explored. The\nsocial sciences examine various aspects of society and the way gender\nstructures society has again been a major concern for feminists. Barad\nand the new materialists suggest ways in which feminist (and queer)\ncritique can be extended to the physical/material sciences. There are\nother areas of scientific research that have also drawn the attention\nof feminists however. Two of particular interest are neurofeminism\nwhich focuses on sexism in the study of the brain and feminist\ncritiques of the closely related field of cognitive science.\n",
