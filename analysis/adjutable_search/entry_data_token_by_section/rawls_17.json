    "main_text": "Justice as Fairness: Justice within a Liberal Society || The Conception of Citizens\n4.4 The Conception of Citizens\n\nHaving surveyed Rawls\u2019s two principles of justice as fairness,\nwe can return to Rawls\u2019s interpretations of the liberal ideas\nthat citizens are free and equal, and that society should be fair.\nRawls uses these conceptions of citizens and society to construct the\nofficial justification for the two principles: the argument from the\noriginal position.\n\nRawls\u2019s interpretation of the idea that citizens are free is as\nfollows. Citizens are free in that each sees herself as being entitled\nto make claims on social institutions in her own right\u2014citizens\nare not slaves or serfs, dependent for their social status on others.\nCitizens are also free in that they see their public identities as\nindependent of any particular comprehensive doctrine: a citizen who\nconverts to Islam, or who recants her faith, will expect, for example,\nto retain all her political rights and liberties throughout the\ntransition. Finally, citizens are free in being able to take\nresponsibility for planning their own lives, given the opportunities\nand resources that they can reasonably expect.\n\nCitizens are equal, Rawls says, in virtue of having the capacities to\nparticipate in social cooperation over a complete life. Citizens may\nhave greater or lesser skills, talents, and powers \u201cabove the\nline\u201d that cooperation requires, but differences above this line\nhave no bearing on citizens\u2019 equal political status.\n\nRawlsian citizens are not only free and equal, they are also\nreasonable and rational. The idea that citizens are reasonable is\nfamiliar from political liberalism. Reasonable citizens have the\ncapacity to abide by fair terms of cooperation, even at the expense of\ntheir own interests, provided that others are also willing to do so.\nIn justice as fairness, Rawls calls this reasonableness the capacity\nfor a sense of justice. Citizens are also rational: they have\nthe capacity to pursue and revise their own view of what is valuable\nin human life. Rawls calls this the capacity for a conception of\nthe good. Together these capacities are called the two moral\npowers.\n\nLike every theory of justice (for example those of Locke, Rousseau,\nand Mill), justice as fairness requires an account of citizens\u2019\nfundamental interests: what citizens need qua citizens. Rawls\nderives his account of primary goods from the conception of\nthe citizen as free and equal, reasonable and rational. Primary goods\nare essential for developing and exercising the two moral powers, and\nare useful for pursuing a wide range of specific conceptions of the\ngood life. Primary goods are these:\n\nThe basic rights and liberties;\nFreedom of movement, and free choice among a wide range of\noccupations;\nThe powers of offices and positions of responsibility;\nIncome and wealth;\nThe social bases of self-respect: the recognition by social\ninstitutions that gives citizens a sense of self-worth and the\nconfidence to carry out their plans (JF, 58\u201359).\n\n\nAll citizens are assumed to have fundamental interests in getting more\nof these primary goods, and political institutions are to evaluate how\nwell citizens are doing according to what primary goods they have. It\nis equalities and inequalities of these primary goods that, Rawls\nclaims, are of the greatest political significance.\n",
