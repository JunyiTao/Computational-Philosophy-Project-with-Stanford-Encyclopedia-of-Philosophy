    "main_text": "Computability and Church\u2019s Thesis || The Role of CT1\n1.3 The Role of CT1\n\nIn Church\u2019s terms, the decision problem for a logistic system is\nthe problem of finding\n\n\nan effective procedure, a decision procedure, by which, for\nan arbitrary wff of the system, it is possible to determine whether or\nnot it is a theorem (and if it is a theorem, to obtain a proof of it).\n(1956a: 273)\n\n\nIn a footnote, Church remarked that from a classical point of view,\nthe parenthetical condition is not required, but is in \u201cthe\ndirection of\u201d intuitionism, which he described as\n\u201cradical\u201d, but the proviso nonetheless was, in subsequent\nparts of his 1956a, always included. But such a determination must be\nmade on the basis of a precise counterpart of the concept of an\neffective procedure, such as a recursive or \u03bb-definable\nprocedure. In case there is a positive result,\n CT2\n allows one to infer that a computable (effective) procedure exists;\nand if the result is negative,\n CT1\n allows the inference to its non-existence. This has been the role of\nCT in computability theory and the development of logic. A\nparticularly telling example is Church\u2019s negative solution to\nthe Entscheidungsproblem\u2014the decision problem for first\norder logic, now known as \u201cChurch\u2019s theorem\u201d\n(1936b). It was felt that a positive solution would render mathematics\ncompletely mechanical at least in principle. Every mathematical\nproblem could in principle be solved by an algorithm. On the other\nhand, the shape of a negative solution was a mystery. It is reported\nthat von Neumann declared that \u201cWe have no clue how to prove\nit\u201d (Gandy 1988: 62). Church\u2019s result rendered a negative\nsolution conceivable and gave some hope that the solution to\nmathematical problems would continue to require human ingenuity. In\nany case, appeals to CT1 have sometimes been viewed as part of the\nproofs giving the solutions to decision problems and\nsometimes not, depending on the required degree of formalization. To\nprove, for example, that some axiomatic theory is undecidable is to\nprove that its set of theorems is not recursive (or not Turing\ncomputable, etc.) and the appeal to CT1 often comes after the strictly\nmathematical work. However, it has not been common to suggest that one\nor other of the precise counterparts of intuitive computability should\nactually replace it; and although G\u00f6del comes close to\nsuch a view (in the case of Turing computability), this is not the\nstandard view. Other reductions of intuitive notions to mathematical\nterms have often been viewed as replacements (cf. Mendelson 1990); but\nthere has been resistance to this view in the case of Church\u2019s\nthesis, for otherwise logicians should long ago have ceased to speak\nof intuitive computability (effective calculability).\n\nHowever, significant developments in computability theory often take\nthe form of informal mathematics, as with the rest of mathematics. An\ninformal method of computation is given, where it is clear that it\ncould be replaced by a formal one although such a demonstration might\nbe thought to be unnecessary or cumbersome. To give a simple example:\nProofs of Craig\u2019s theorem that any recursively enumerable set of\nformulas is recursively axiomatizable often take the form of an\ninformal argument that the set of Craig-axioms is decidable; and then\n CT1\n is applied to conclude that it is recursive (cf. Craig 1953). Rogers\n(1967) gives many examples of the role of informal mathematics in\nconjunction with CT1 in computability theory. In fact, Rogers\u2019\nclassic text uses informal mathematics together with Church\u2019s\nthesis in its positive (non-contrapositive) form to develop recursive\nfunction theory as a whole. By contrast, Davis (1958) gives a fully\nformal account and so uses CT1 mainly in its contrapositive form, or,\nequivalently, in its positive form but resting on a reductio\nassumption. A third role of CT1 has been to motivate the proofs that\ncertain basic sets and relations are recursive. For example,\nmembership in the set of formulas of a standard formalized language is\nintuitively computable. Hence by CT1 it must be recursive, but a proof\nthat it is recursive can be surprisingly complex (see Boolos et al.\n2007: Ch. 15).\n",
