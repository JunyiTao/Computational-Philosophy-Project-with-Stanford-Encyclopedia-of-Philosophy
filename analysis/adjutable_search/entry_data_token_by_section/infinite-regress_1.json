    "main_text": "Regress and Theoretical Vices || Regress and Contradiction\n1.1 Regress and Contradiction\n\nOne such kind of case is when the very same principles of a theory\nthat generate the regress also lead to a contradiction. If this is so\nthen it does not matter what we think about infinite regress in\ngeneral, we will of course have reason to reject the theory, because\nit is contradictory. Two such examples are discussed by Daniel Nolan\n(2001), and we will recount one of them here (also cf. Clark 1988).\nThe theory in question is Plato\u2019s theory of Forms, and the\nregress objection is Parmenides\u2019s Third Man objection, as\nreconstructed by Vlastos (1954).\n\nSuppose some things, the \\(X\\)s, are alike in a certain way: they\nshare some feature, \\(F\\). The theory of Forms says that if this is so\nthen there is some form, \\(F\\)-ness, in which the \\(X\\)s each\nparticipate and in virtue of which they have that shared feature. The\ntheory of Forms also says that Forms are self-predicated: the Form of\nthe good is good, the Form of largeness is large, etc. So the Form of\n\\(F\\)-ness is \\(F\\). In that respect, then, it is like each of the\n\\(X\\)s. So not only are the \\(X\\)s all alike in a certain way, the\n\\(X\\)s and \\(F\\)-ness are all alike in a certain way. And so there\nmust be some Form in which each of the \\(X\\)s and \\(F\\)-ness\nparticipate, in virtue of which they have this shared feature.\nHowever, this Form cannot be \\(F\\)-ness, because the Form must be\ndistinct from the things that have that character that participate in\nit, so the \\(X\\)s and \\(F\\)-ness must participate in a new form\n\\(F_1\\)-ness. But \\(F_1\\)-ness will, just like the \\(X\\)s and\n\\(F\\)-ness, be \\(F_1\\), given that Forms self-predicate, and so the\n\\(X\\)s, \\(F\\)-ness and \\(F_1\\)-ness are all alike in a certain way\n\u2026 and so on. We are off on an infinite regress.\n\nWhatever one thinks about regresses in general, the principles that\ngenerate this regress must be denied, for they lead to contradiction.\nThe theory of Forms, as presented here at least, tells us (i) that\nwhen some things are a certain way, they participate in a single Form,\nin virtue of which they are that way; (ii) that Forms\nself-predicate\u2014Forms themselves are the way that things that\nparticipate in them are; and (iii) that the Form is distinct from the\nthings that participate in it. Each of these three claims is essential\nto generating the regress: without (i) we don\u2019t get the\nexistence of a Form in the first place, without (ii) we don\u2019t\nget the second list of things with a shared feature, so would stop\nsimply with the \\(X\\)s participating in some Form, and without (iii)\nwe could conclude that just as the \\(X\\)s participate in \\(F\\)-ness,\nso do the \\(X\\)s and \\(F\\)-ness itself\u2014there would be no need\nfor a new Form. So (i)\u2013(iii) generate a regress, and they are\neach needed to do so. But (i)\u2013(iii) are inconsistent, and no\nregress argument is needed to show that. (i) and (ii) together entail\nthat Forms participate in themselves. (ii) tells us that \\(F\\)-ness is\n\\(F\\), and (i) tells us that if this is so it is in virtue of\n\\(F\\)-ness participating in \\(F\\)-ness, since that is how in\ngeneral things get to be \\(F\\). So \\(F\\)-ness participates in\nitself, and so by (iii) \\(F\\)-ness must be distinct from itself, since\nForms are distinct from that which participates in them. But nothing\nis distinct from itself: contradiction.\n\nWe don\u2019t need an argument against infinite regresses to show\nthat this version of the theory of Forms is no good: that it is\ncontradictory is the best reason we could have to reject it. Now, that\nthe theory is contradictory and that it leads to an intuitively\nworrying infinite regress are not unrelated. Beyond the mere\nontological profligacy involved in being committed to infinitely many\nForms any time we notice that some things are some way (we will come\nback to ontological profligacy and regress in section 4), what seems\nintuitively problematic about the regress of Forms is that we\nshouldn\u2019t get a new Form each time. The \\(X\\)s\nare \\(F\\), so we have the form of \\(F\\)-ness in which they\nparticipate. We then get a new Form in which the \\(X\\)s and\n\\(F\\)-ness all participate. But why do we have a new Form? We\ndon\u2019t have a new shared feature, we have the very same shared\nfeature we started with: just as the \\(X\\)s are all \\(F\\), so is\n\\(F\\)-ness itself. We already have the Form that makes\nsomething \\(F\\): \\(F\\)-ness. The regress is troubling because we\nshouldn\u2019t be invoking a new Form, but we have to because of the\nban on Forms participating in themselves. But this diagnosis of why\nthe regress is troubling is really just another way of stating the\ncontradiction at the heart of the theory: the Form \\(F\\)-ness is\nsupposed to be in general the thing in virtue of which things\nget to be \\(F\\), but it also cannot be because it itself must be \\(F\\)\nand it cannot participate in itself. So the regress and the\ncontradiction are intimately related. As Nolan (2001, 528) puts it:\n\u201cinfinite regresses of this sort and the statement of formal\ncontradiction are different ways of bringing out [the same]\nunacceptable feature.\u201d\n\nThis is an easy case, because we don\u2019t have to adjudicate on\nwhether the fact that the theory leads to an infinite regress is\nitself objectionable. The principles that lead to regress also lead to\ncontradiction, and we know that a theory\u2019s being contradictory\nis a good reason to reject it, whether it leads to regress or not.\n",
