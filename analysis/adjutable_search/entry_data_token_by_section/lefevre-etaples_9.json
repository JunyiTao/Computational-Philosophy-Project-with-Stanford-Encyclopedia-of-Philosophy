    "main_text": "Philosophical Themes || Metaphysics\n5. Legacy\n\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s editions of Neoplatonic works became important\nin their own right, long after his encyclopedic repristination of\nAristotle had been supplanted by handbooks like those of the Lutheran\nAristotelian Philip Melanchthon. His expanded edition of the Hermetic\ncorpus (1505b)\u2014with the Crater Hermetis of\nLudovico Lazzarelli and another book in addition to the fourteen\ntreatises known to Ficino\u2014became the most widely adopted text,\nreprinted all over Europe, along with his annotations. Similarly, his\nedition and commentary on Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite was read\nthroughout the sixteenth century, and his edition of Cusanus remained\nthe standard Opera omnia up to the twentieth century.\n\nAs discussed above, Lef\u00e8vre regularly mentioned\n\u201canalogy\u201d as a way to relate truths in different domains.\nWhile it seems that he never fleshed out the details of this method,\nhis obsession with providing trustworthy steps to a unified,\nmethodized, and above all pedagogically useful philosophy is perhaps\nhis most lasting legacy\u2014one which would be taken up in debates\nover method and textbooks throughout the sixteenth century (Schmitt\n1988). The fascination of Lef\u00e8vre and his students with\nanalogies and mathematics offers a glimpse of the early motivations to\nfind a \u201cuniversal method\u201d that later bloomed in debates\nover universal arts (Rossi 2000: 29, 39; Ong 1958: 76). Timothy Reiss\nfirst identified Lef\u00e8vre and his circle with the early swell of\nphilosophical interest in the quadrivium in the sixteenth century\n(Reiss 1997). Oronce Fine in particular extended\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s mathematical legacy (Pantin 2009). By the early\nseventeenth century, some authors would put forward a method which was\nstrongly mathematical and which purported to unify not only arithmetic\nand geometry but all disciplines under a mathesis universalis\n(Rabouin 2009). Lef\u00e8vre could be said to have inaugurated the\ngenre of printed philosophical textbooks in which such positions\nemerged (Oosterhoff 2018).\n\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s students\u2014with whom he had always worked\nclosely\u2014took up his project and developed it in several\ndirections. They frequently published his works, especially in\nStrassburg and Cologne. In Paris, as Rice (1970) noted, several\nfigures associated with Lef\u00e8vre set up on philosophical\nprojects rooted in his teaching: most notably, Josse Clichtove and\nCharles de Bovelles. Clichtove, who wrote many commentaries on\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s editions, became an important figure in the\nParis faculty of theology. Bovelles deserves particular attention for\nhis concerted effort to develop a fresh philosophical synthesis, which\nshared with Lef\u00e8vre core themes such as the dignity of mankind\nas the mirror of nature, human freedom, the distinctiveness of our\nintellectual faculties, and the importance of mathematics in modeling\nphilosophical perspectives (Faye 1998). Lef\u00e8vre\u2019s effort\nto provide students with handbooks in all fields of knowledge can be\ncompared to Ramus\u2019s philosophical reforms.\n\nHis students and successive generations of scholars carried forward\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s conviction that a renewal of philosophy should\nbegin with new translations and philological work. Around 1516, his\nstudent Gerard Roussel retranslated Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean\nEthics from the Greek; he also wrote a long, philosophical\ncommentary on Boethius (1521), picking up the Pythagorean and\nmathematical interests which had also motivated Lef\u00e8vre\u2019s\nreform of university philosophy. Another student, Fran\u00e7ois\nVatables (later the first Royal Professor of Hebrew at the\nColl\u00e8ge Royal) similarly retranslated large parts of the\nAristotelian corpus. Though he did not study directly with\nLef\u00e8vre, Symphorien Champier fashioned his idiosyncratic\nintroduction to philosophy, the Janua (1498), by liberally\nexcerpting from his works. Later in the century,\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s sustained and wide-ranging effort to make\nAristotle eloquent was taken over by humanist translators of the\nphilosopher such as Denys Lambin, Adrien Turn\u00e8be, and Joachim\nP\u00e9rion. Lef\u00e8vre influenced the history of philosophy as\nmuch through the deep relationships he cultivated with his students as\nthrough his ambitious use of the new technology of the printing press\nto reinvent the university philosophy curriculum.\n",
