    "main_text": "Practical Knowledge || Objections to the knowledge condition\n4.3 Objections to the knowledge condition\n\nDavidson argued that the knowledge condition, and even a weaker belief\ncondition, is vulnerable to counterexamples:\n\n[I]n writing heavily on this page I may be intending to produce ten\nlegible carbon copies. I do not know, or believe with any confidence,\nthat I am succeeding. But if I am producing ten legible carbon copies,\nI am certainly doing it intentionally. (Davidson 1970b, 92)\n\n\nIn this case, Davidson argued that the agent is making 10 carbon\ncopies intentionally despite not believing that he is (never mind\nknowing); and some recent empirical results appear to support this\nverdict (Vekony 2021). Hence, it seems that agents can \u03c6 intentionally without\neven believing that they are \u03c6-ing.\n\nFor a long time, this and similar examples (e.g. Bratman 1987, 37,\nMele 1992, ch.8) were taken as decisive refutations in the literature,\nbut their force has been contested recently (Thompson 2011; Small\n2012; Wolfson 2012; Stathopoulos 2016; Beddor and Pavese 2021; Pavese\nforthcoming). The impetus for many of these responses stems from\nThompson\u2019s work on the importance of aspect for action-theory.\nIn particular, actions in progress display what Falvey (2000) has\ncalled \u201copenness\u201d, which corresponds to the inaptly-named\n\u201cimperfective paradox\u201d in the linguistic literature (more\nbelow): Someone can be doing something and never get around to have\ndone it (e.g. I can be crossing the street, but never cross it). It is\nthus possible for someone to know that they are \u03c6-ing even if they\ndon\u2019t, in fact, get to have \u03c6-ed. To apply these\nconsiderations to Davidson\u2019s argument, we need to distinguish\nbetween two cases. First, the normal case where the agent intends to\nmake 10 carbon copies, but has the opportunity to correct and continue\non if things go wrong (e.g. if he initially only makes 5, but then\nmakes 5 more). Second, the one-shot case where the agent must make 10\ncarbon copies in one go (say, because he is competing in a copy-making\ntournament). In the normal case, it appears like the agent may know\nthat he is making 10 carbon copies (even if he doesn\u2019t know that\nhe will complete the 10 in one go). So it raises no problems for the\nknowledge condition. What, then, of the one-shot case? Although here\nit may be granted that the agent doesn\u2019t know that he is making\n10 carbon copies, it is questionable whether he is making 10 carbon\ncopies intentionally. The reason is that if he were to make\n10 carbon copies as a result of pressing as hard as he can, this would\nbe too much an accidental result of his performance. But, as we saw\n(see section 2.4), accidentality is incompatible with intentional\naction. Hence, in the normal case the agent acts intentionally while\nknowing, while in the one-shot case he doesn\u2019t even act\nintentionally.\n\nIt is contentious whether the foregoing response works (see Kirley\nforthcoming, for criticism), but it shows that Davidson\u2019s\nexample is far from decisive. However, other examples appear to be\nimmune from this type of response. For instance, Schwenkler (2019)\npresents a case of an agent who is trying to fill a cistern in the\nkind of environment where doubts that he is doing so are appropriate\n(e.g. where he is filling up one of many cisterns, but he knows\nseveral of them are broken, but not which). Suppose, however, that he\nis in fact filling up the cistern (it is not broken). If he does so to\npoison the inhabitants of the house, Anscombe\u2019s question\n\u201cWhy?\u201d appears to have application, which means that he is\nfilling up the cistern intentionally, even though the best he could\nsay is that \u201che thinks\u201d he is doing so (Schwenkler 2019,\n188\u20139; cf. Vekony, Mele, and Rose 2021; Shepherd & Carter\nforthcoming).\n\nThe key difference between this case and the carbon copier is that the\nagent remains fully in control of her action: the fact that he is\nfilling up the cistern by moving his arms so and so is no accident.\nSo, there is no reason to dispute the action\u2019s status as\nintentional. Still, whatever belief the person might have is unsafe,\nas nearby beliefs (such as those relating to the other faucets) are\nfalse. Hence, it isn\u2019t knowledge.\n\nBuilding on similar considerations, Pi\u00f1eros Glasscock (2020b)\npresents a version of Williamson (2000)\u2019s anti-luminosity\nargument, aiming to show that the knowledge condition is incompatible\nwith a safety principle, to the effect that to constitute knowledge, a\nrepresentation could not easily be wrong. He argues that since agents\ncan slowly transition from \u03c6-ing to not-\u03c6-ing through changes\nso small as to outstrip the agent\u2019s discriminating capacities,\nagents must sometimes find themselves in situations where they are\nacting intentionally but either lack the confidence to possess\nknowledge, or, if they have it, it is misplaced. Either way, they do\nnot know.\n\nTogether, these arguments force defenders of the knowledge condition\ninto an uncomfortable position: if they wish to uphold the knowledge\ncondition, they must reject safety for practical knowledge. However,\nthis threatens to undermine the point of counting this as knowledge,\ngiven how epistemically frail it can be. On the other hand, it has\nbeen argued that a suitable understanding of the knowledge condition\nmay evade these worries (Beddor and Pavese 2021; Valaris 2021).\n",
