    "main_text": "Metaphysics of Mechanisms || Mechanisms and Realization\n4.3 Mechanisms and Realization\nBecause the framework concept of a mechanism is so useful for\nthinking about levels and explanation in the sciences, some scholars\nhave sought in the notion of mechanism a way of fleshing out the\nontological relationship of realization.\nAccording to the \u201cflat view\u201d (Gillett 2002) realization\nis a relationship between different properties of one and the same\nthing (Kim 1998; Shapiro 2000; Shoemaker 2003, 2007; Polger 2007). The\nsubset view, which holds that a property P1 (e.g., mean kinetic energy\nof the gas) realizes property P2 (e.g., temperature of the gas) when\nthe causal powers distinctive of P2 (temperature) are a subset of the\ncausal powers distinctive of P2 (mean kinetic energy), is an example\nof the flat view. P1 and P2 are both attributed to the same thing, the\ngas (Gillett 2002, 2003). The dimensioned view describes realization\nas a relationship holding between the properties of wholes and the\nproperties of the parts and their organization. This view of\nrealization comports with the explanatory aims of the special sciences\nand fits nicely with the evidential base on which interlevel claims\nare grounded (see Aizawa and Gillett 2011). Gillett has since expanded\nthis notion to handle the realization of objects, properties, and\nprocesses (Gillett 2013); for criticism and alternatives, see Polger\n2010; Melnyk 2003; Melnyk 2010)\n",
