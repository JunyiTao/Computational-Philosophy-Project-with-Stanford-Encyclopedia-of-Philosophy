    "main_text": "Hybrid Interpretivism\n3. Hybrid Interpretivism\n\nHybrid interpretivism represents another possibility along\nthat spectrum. It begins at the austere norm-based explanation of law\nbut defends an even more inclusive conception. \n\n\nFor hybrid interpretivism, the set of institutionally valid\nnorms\u2014the norms determined by what the institutions\nsaid\u2014forms the interpretive baseline. Interpretation is a kind\nof moral processing of these norms. To interpret is to assess the\nnorms constituted by institutional communication and adjust the set in\norder to make it more attractive in some way\u2014to make it better\nconform to the abstract point of legal practice against which it is\ninterpreted. Hybrid interpretivism is therefore the thesis that the\ninstitutional input to the interpretive process\u2014what the\ninstitutions said\u2014does not alone yield the final, complete set\nof legally valid norms. Rather, the final set of valid norms is the\noutput of the process. The final set takes as an additional input\ncertain moral facts. Yet the contribution of each kind of input\nremains distinct. Each episode of institutional communication, by\nitself, creates an institutionally valid norm which it makes available\nfor interpretive scrutiny. The hybrid interpretivist considers as\nsettled, without reference to any moral or other substantive normative\nfacts, how the contingencies of institutional practice contribute to\nthe law: he relies on the orthodox explanation of that mechanism\n(cf. Raz 1986, attributing the hybrid view to Dworkin). But he thinks\nthat there are additional conditions of validity. Substantive\nnormative facts may filter, supplement, or otherwise modify the\noriginal norms, as dictated by the interpretive goals in play. Legal\nvalidity of a norm now entails that the norm was either created by\nofficial communication and survived interpretive scrutiny or that it\nbears a certain relation, defined by the general point of legal\npractice, to such survivor norms.\n\n\nOne variant of hybrid interpretivism is the conception of law as\nconsisting of both rules and principles. This is typically attributed\nto Dworkin\u2019s early work (Dworkin 1978; notice that Dworkin actually\ndisowns this view: 1978, at 76). Institutions convey rules, as Hart\nclaimed. These are screened and rejected or modified to the extent\nthat they conflict with certain basic moral principles of fairness or\njustice, as they did in Riggs.  Rules are also supplemented\nwith non-conflicting principles in hard cases, where the rules alone\nyield no determinate results. In such cases, the principles fill the\ngaps. The law is the hybrid of the two sets of standards generated by\nthe filtering and gap-filling operation.\n\n\nA sophisticated variant of this view can be built around the notion of\nprincipled consistency (\u201cintegrity\u201d) which, according to\nDworkin\u2019s later work, is a distinct political virtue that forms the\nfoundation of law (Dworkin 1986). Taking principled consistency in the\nlaw as an interpretive target, the interpreter identifies a set of\nprinciples that together justify the given set of norms. The\ninterpreter works therefore with two sets of norms, one composed of\nnorms conveyed by institutions, the other composed of uncreated,\ngenuine moral norms\u2014general moral principles. He is to compare\nthe two sets, and adjust the first in light of the second. He may then\nsay that the law now includes both the original norms and the\nprinciples (or perhaps some further norms determined by the\nprinciples). Like its older, rules-and-principles cousin, the law is a\nhybrid, a creature of the two separate sets of standards, one grounded\nin social facts, the other in moral facts, that interpretation blends\ntogether (cf. Raz 1986). (A closely related variant says that the law is simply the set of principles that best justifies the institutionally given norms or, more loosely, the legal and political practices that generate them; Greenberg 2014). \n\n\nIn this operation, the principles (and the further norms that they\ndetermine) are valid in virtue of the relation of justification they\nbear to the original norms. In the presently relevant sense of\njustification, an eligible principle is one that reflects an ideal\narrangement, prescinding from institutional practice, against which\nnorms that the practice produced are measured, provided the principle\nis at least logically consistent with the norms. Consider principles\nthat set out the morally right way to identify and deal with private\nwrongs, setting aside the actual practice of institutions in that\narea. Such principles would be germane to the project of designing\ninstitutions of tort from scratch or of reforming existing ones. But\nfor some principles to be said to justify some actual, institutionally\ncreated, norms of tort, as the hybrid interpretivist says his favoured\nprinciples do, it wouldn\u2019t be enough that the principles captured the\nrelevant ideals. They would further need to be at least consistent, in\nsome specified sense, with the norms. A principle wouldn\u2019t count as\njustifying an institutionally created norm in any sense, when it\nprohibited what the norm required or permitted. For any putative set of justifying principles, it\u2019s a condition of eligibility additional to and independent of merit that the principles be consistent, in some\nspecified sense, with the set of the original norms.\n\n\nThe understanding of principled consistency used in this conception of\ninterpretivism corresponds to one understanding of Dworkin\u2019s famous\ndistinction between fit and justification as dimensions of\ninterpretation (Dworkin 1986). Dworkin said that correct\ninterpretation must both fit and justify its object. On the\nunderstanding in discussion, fit operates as a threshold constraint on\neligibility of interpretations. Independent moral appeal governs the\nchoice among alternatives that pass the threshold (cf. Raz\n1994: 223). Fit, on this conception, is meant to ensure that a candidate interpretation\nis indeed an interpretation of some object rather than an\ninvention. It is a nonmoral constraint, in two ways. First, it is\nmeant to secure consistency with a set of norms that are grounded in\nnonmoral considerations\u2014in the action and psychology of agents\nand institutions. Second, the relevant notion of consistency itself is\nmeant to be nonmoral, a constraint of formal consistency between norms\nand principles. (See Greenberg 2004 on fit as a matter of formal\nconsistency with practice. Greenberg argues that a constraint of\nformal consistency is empty.) The thought is that the original set of\nnorms could not really constrain interpretation if substantive, moral\nconsiderations played some role in determining what it is to fit the\nnorms. If the notion of fit were tainted by the very kind of\nconsideration that defines the ideals against which the actual norms\nare to be measured, the distinction between interpreting the actual\npractice of institutions and inventing a new, better practice would be\nerased.\n\n\nIn order to pursue principled consistency in the law while taking the\nset of institutionally created norms as the baseline, the interpreter\nwill have to aim at a composite objective, which can be analysed\ninto its components. He will have to strive for principle and for\nconsistency.\n\n\nSome of the time, the interpreter may be able to pursue both objectives\nsimultaneously without difficulty. Given some principles that justify\nnorms in this sense, the interpreter might add to the set certain\nfurther norms such as those implied by the explicit communication that\nconstitutes the original norms, if adding those norms would give better effect\nto the principles and thereby improve principled consistency (on the\ncurrent understanding of that notion) in the way government treats its\ncitizens. Or he may add certain norms that correspond to the relevant\nprinciples so do not conflict with the prior, institutionally\ncommunicated norms with which by hypothesis the principles are\nconsistent, whether or not the new norms are implied by the\nprior norms. Or (if this is different) he may add the norms that\njudges are morally required to rely on in order to resolve residual\nmatters in domains that are only partially regulated by the original\nset. In his view, the expanded rather than the original set of\nstandards would be valid law.\n\n\nBut the interpreter can\u2019t reasonably hope that his work will always be\nso easy. Even assuming a fairly decent institutional history, the set\nof norms that would form the baseline would be the product of\npolitical action taken by different agents at different times, with a\nvariety of motives and facing different political and other\nconstraints in their choices (Raz 1994). The norms produced might\nconflict in their justification, some consistent with one scheme but\nindefensible under another. There might be no scheme of independently\nappealing principles\u2014certainly not a perfectly just and\notherwise compelling scheme\u2014consistent with all the norms\nwithout exception. If the baseline included a norm that couldn\u2019t be\njustified by his favored scheme of principle, the interpreter might\nhave to try a different, less than perfect scheme, under which the\nproblematic norm might be subsumed, and trade merit for\nconsistency. But even if he were willing to accept a measure of\nimperfection in a scheme\u2019s appeal, he might fail to find any eligible\nscheme, in which case he would have to reject the norm. Of course, if\nthe communicated norms were to function as a fundamental,\npre-interpretive constraint, rejection would have to be rare and\nsubject to special justification. Only something about the remaining\ninstitutional norms\u2014that they all cohered with a given set of\nprinciples\u2014could allow the interpreter to reject the\noutlier.\n On the other hand, there might be several mutually inconsistent\nschemes of principle, each consistent with the original set of\nnorms. The interpreter would therefore have to choose from among these\nschemes on grounds other than consistency with institutional\npractice. Normally it would not be permissible, on this model, to add\na principle to the original set of norms (or to rely upon it to\ngenerate more norms) just because it was attractive. Rather, the\nprinciple would have to bear a relation at least of consistency with\nsome norm in the original set. But, in case that relation did not\nuniquely determine the principles in a scheme, the interpreter would\nhave to choose without being able to ground the choice by appeal to\nthe original set. He would have to choose on merit alone. (This is a\nconsequence of the model that has attracted a lot of criticism. See\nRaz 1994: 223\u20136; Finnis 1987, 1992. For Dworkin\u2019s protests that\nthe distinction is merely heuristic, and should not be understood to\nmark two different dimensions of interpretation, see Dworkin 1982,\n1986, 2006.)\n\n\nA harder problem would arise where there are multiple candidate\nschemes of principle that are unequal in both independent appeal and\nconsistency, and imperfect in each dimension. Should the interpreter\nreject more of the original norms in return for an improvement in appeal, or accept a\nlarger compromise in appeal for a gain in consistency? At least in\nsome cases, where the relative gains and losses would not be\ndisproportionate on some conception of their magnitude, the\ninterpreter could not appeal to either merit or consistency to justify\na choice and it is unclear to what else he might appeal.\n\n\nThere are further difficulties. Hybrid interpretivism gives us no\nreason to abandon a sharp distinction between the pre-interpretively\ngiven corpus of institutionally valid norms constituted by\ncommunication alone, on which interpretation operates, and the final\nset of norms that interpretation yields. It therefore makes it seem\nthat the question whether the law is limited to the unprocessed input\nor extends to the processed output is merely verbal (Hart\n1994, Postscript;\nSchauer 1996; Greenberg 2011a).\n\n\nGiven these problems, hybrid interpretivism makes interpretation too\nclose to cooking the books to make them reflect some ideal which, if left\nalone, they fail. It is reasonable to take it, not as a doctrine about\nwhat determines the content of the law, but instead as an argument\nabout how best to decide hard cases given the law (now understood to\nbe restricted to the institutionally communicated norms). It becomes a\ntheory of adjudication, which builds upon the orthodox explanation of\nhow institutional action creates rights and obligations, namely by conveying norms, and recommends some way of resolving disputes given\nthose norms. Even so reinterpreted, problems remain. For hybrid\ninterpretivism now seems to recommend that judges extend the effect of\nany norms they find (or at least the ones not bad enough to fail the\ntest of consistency with even the least acceptable scheme of\nprinciple) into situations the norms don\u2019t explicitly or clearly\nregulate, and it\u2019s doubtful that some political ideal should support\nthis conservative policy (Raz 1986: 1111,\n1994: 224).\n\n\nThe immediate source of the difficulties lies in the composite\ncharacter of the ideal of principled consistency deployed by hybrid\ninterpretivism, which entails that the interpreter must simultaneously\naim at consistency and merit, understood as separate targets which\nneedn\u2019t coincide. Given the difficulties, it is unclear that\ninterpretation could secure completeness, understood as the potential to\nresolve all possible disputes (which is often understood to be\ninterpretation\u2019s further, perhaps basic objective; see Raz 1994;\nFinnis 1987; see also Leiter 2007, who claims that the thesis that\nthere is a right answer to all legal questions is at the core of\nDworkin\u2019s project). The composite conception of principled consistency\nis forced upon hybrid interpretivism by its fundamental\ncommitment, to which the difficulties are ultimately traced: that the\nstarting point of interpretation must be some norms constituted by the\ncontingencies of institutional communication, and that\ninterpretation\u2019s purpose is to compare and somehow to reconcile those\nnorms with ideals.\n\n\nThe hybrid interpretivist may claim that it is a deep constitutive\nfact about law that the institutional input to the law must be\ninterpreted in the relevant sense. Still, his view is hybrid in that\nit takes as the fundamental, pre-interpretive constituent of the law\nsome norm-creating acts of communication. So the basic explanation of the\nlegal relevance of political decisions\u2014that the\ndecisions matter to legal rights and obligations and indeed that they\nmatter as such communications\u2014is not itself interpretive in\ncharacter. The fact that, other things equal, an institution\u2019s say-so\nmakes law, is a primitive legal fact, or at least a legal fact that is\nnot to be explained by either the nature of interpretation or some\nsubstantive interpretive conclusion in the legal domain. Hybrid\ninterpretivism is not therefore faithful to the basic interpretivist\nidea that the legal relevance of institutional practice is\nfundamentally explained by some political ideals. For example, that the fact that it\u2019s\nthe duty of government to treat its citizens in a manner consistent in\nprinciple makes institutional decisions relevant to their legal\nobligations, rather than supplement the decisions or filter their\nresults.\n\n\nBefore we turn to that alternative, it is worth noting that hybrid\ninterpretivism differs from the view, not similarly\nunfaithful to the basic interpretivist idea, that some political ideal\n(perhaps involving fair notice) makes it the case that institutional\ndecisions contribute to the law the norms that the decisions are widely understood to express or endorse. (An example is the doctrine Dworkin\ncalls \u201cconventionalism\u201d, an interpretive conception of law\nthat he rejects as inferior to the conception he calls\n\u201cintegrity\u201d.) For such a view, political ideals and\ninstitutional history would together constitute the content of the law\nin the right way. As a result, interpretation would be over at the\nstage of identification of the norms. Hybrid interpretivism, by\ncontrast, takes the norms as the object of interpretation and so its\nstarting point, not its end.\n",
