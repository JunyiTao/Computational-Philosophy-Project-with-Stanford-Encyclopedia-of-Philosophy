    "main_text": "The Role of Interpretation in Legal Reasoning: || An Initial View of the Nature of Interpretation: Conservation and Creativity\n2.2 An Initial View of the Nature of Interpretation: Conservation and Creativity\n\n\nAs might be expected, as a result of these different (although often\nintertwining) intellectual backgrounds and sources of interest in\ninterpretation, legal theorists approach this subject with very\ndifferent questions and concerns to which they give concomitantly\ndifferent answers. For all this, however, a surprising number of legal\ntheorists agree\u2014at least at an abstract level\u2014about\none central characteristic of interpretation, namely that\ninterpretation is a Janus-faced concept, encompassing both a\nbackward-looking conserving component, and a forward-looking creative\none. In other words, an interpretation of something is an\ninterpretation of something\u2014it presupposes that there\nis a something, or an original, there to be interpreted, and to which\nany valid interpretation must be faithful to some extent, thus\ndifferentiating interpretation from pure invention\u2014but it is\nalso an interpretation of something, i.e. an attempt not\nmerely to reproduce but to make something of or bring something out of\nan original. (See e.g. Fiss 1982; Dworkin 1986; Marmor 1992 &\n2005; Endicott 1994; Raz 1996b & 1996c.) \n\n\nMuch jurisprudential writing on interpretation in legal reasoning is\nconcerned with how to strike the right balance between the conserving\nand creative elements in interpretation, and with the constraints which\nare and/or should be operative upon judges as they undertake this\nbalancing act. Some theorists claim that such concerns about how one\nought to interpret the law indicate that it is part of the way that we\nthink about this practice that we regard rival interpretations as\nsubject to objective evaluation as good or bad, better or worse,\ncorrect or incorrect (Dworkin 1986; Raz 1996b and 1996c). On this view,\ncharacterisations of interpretation which attempt to impugn the\nobjectivity of such evaluations (e.g. Levinson 1982) are to be\nunderstood as revisionist accounts which attempt to persuade us that\nall is not as it appears to be with our practice of judging\ninterpretations to be good or bad, better or worse, correct or\nincorrect as we currently understand it (see e.g. Raz 1996b).\n",
