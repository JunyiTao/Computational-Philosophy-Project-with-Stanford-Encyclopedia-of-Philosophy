    "main_text": "Contextualism and Ontological Ambiguity\n1. Contextualism and Ontological Ambiguity\n\nThe meta-level claim about self-recontextualization as self-reversal,\nwhich applies at all levels to all Tiantai doctrines, is itself the\nconsequence of some considerations concerning contextualism, holism\nand conditionality, with which it is thus convenient to begin our\nexposition. The heart of the matter, the most fundamental and\nfar-reaching renovation of Buddhism accomplished by the Tiantai\nSchool, is the move from the Two Truths model to a Three\nTruths one. The Two Truths is an epistemological and pedagogical\nheuristic in most Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, but in Tiantai the\nThree Truths are taken to be a necessary logical entailment of any\nproposed determinacy, and thus to apply equally to any possible\nontological, epistemological and ethical entities. They can be\nsummarized by the claim that no entity can be either the same as or\ndifferent from any other entity. This relation of\nneither-sameness-nor-difference, a formula used by many\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist schools but often interpreted as applying\nnot to \u201cConventional Truth\u201d but only to \u201cUltimate Truth\u201d (on which see\nbelow), and thus understood simply as an instance of\napophasis (i.e., the claim that only negations or silence\nare truly appropriate descriptions of ultimate reality, since\nno finite or relative predicates can be legitimately applied\nto what is infinite or absolute), is in Tiantai instead developed\ninto what might be described as the \u201casness\u201d relation,\napplying to all putative or real entities without exception, affecting\neven what is within the scope of Conventional Truth: each determinate\nthing is the totality of all other possible things as this\nthing. The non-sameness implies that the specific characteristics of\nall other things are in some sense discoverable in each thing, that\nall their manifold properties and functions will also be\nsimultaneously operative there.\n\nA simple thought experiment may draw out the implications of this\nidea. Imagine that you come upon what looks like a white marble lying\non the ground. You experience it as round, as small, as white, and\nimmediately you construct a lived attitude toward it\u2014something\nthat can be picked up, rolled, played with, pocketed. But then you go\nto pick it up, and find that it is stuck to the ground. You cannot\nlift it. You try to dig it out, and find that it extends downward,\nfurther than you can dig: it is the tip of a larger item. It appears\nto be a long rod or cylindrical pipe of some kind. But as you dig\nfurther, you find that after about five inches of narrow thinness it\nstarts to expand outward; it is a spire on top of a cone. This cone\nexpands outward as you keep digging down. When you get about twenty\nfeet down, the cone ends, embedded in a soft, scaly material. Then the\nearth rumbles and an enormous two-horned monster emerges from\nunderground; it is 500 feet tall, and each of its horns is twenty feet\nhigh, with a long sharp tip. You had been digging out one of the\nhorns. What you had seen as a marble on the ground was in fact the\nvery tip of one of the horns. Now look again at that tip. You had\nexperienced it as round. But it turns out it was not round at all: it\nis sharp. Yet it has not changed at all: you are still seeing what you\nsaw. It is not white either: the tip had looked white against the\nground, but now, looking at the monster\u2019s horn as whole, you see\nit as a pattern of mostly green spots interspersed here and there with\nwhite: looked at as a whole, the horn, including its tip, looks green.\nNor is it movable, pocketable, playwithable\u2014it is rather\ndangerous, razor sharp, to be avoided. And yet nothing of what you saw\nwas taken away: it was just supplemented with further information,\nwith its larger context.\n\nTiantai views all things this way. Normally you might make some\nqualifications in order to preserve your view that some facts are\nunambiguous (indeed, to some extent this process is precisely what\nphilosophy traditionally is); you might say \u201cthe tip,\nconsidered in isolation, is indeed round\u201d. The usual\nprocedure is to interpose the distinction between \u201chow it\nappears\u201d and \u201chow it really is\u201d, some form of\nreality-appearance distinction. But the most important consequence of\nthe transformation of the Two Truths into the Three Truths is the\nwholesale dismissal of the appearance-reality distinction. Tiantai\nwould reject the privileging of either considering in isolation or\nconsidering in any single particular connection; any of these would be\nlegitimate in some heuristic (upayic) contexts, but none\ncould be non-arbitrarily assigned the role of representing what is the\n\u201creally the case\u201d, simpliciter. To see something\nis to see \u201cnot-all\u201d of it. We are always seeing a little\nfragment of the world, but every bit of the world is changed by the\nfact that it is a part of the world, is recontextualized by the rest\nof the world, by the rest of space and the rest of time. In fact, if\nwe ever saw all, we would see nothing. For to see, to take something\nas \u201cthere\u201d, as \u201creal\u201d, is to place it within a\ncontext, to contrast it to something outside of itself, something\nwhich is not it. To see all is to see nothing. As in the case of\n\u201cfire\u201d and \u201cwater\u201d above, if someone were to\nsay that the entire universe is \u201cround\u201d, this would\nrequire changing the meaning of \u201cround\u201d. This round would\nnot be round: for round requires a non-round outside it to be\nround. It would have to be bordered by something to shape it into\nroundness, but the universe would also include that\noutside-the-roundness part. If someone were to say the entire universe\nwere sharp, this would also make no sense. This sharp would not be\nsharp; for sharp requires a non-sharp outside it to be sharp.\nTo say the whole universe is sharp, then, means no more and no less\nthan saying the whole universe is round. We can make no specific\ndeterminations about the whole, about the entire universe, for that\noutside of which nothing exists; for all particular specifications\nrequire a contrast to something outside of them. Everything we can say\nor think comes from the realm of the finite, and cannot be applied to\nthe infinite. But the Tiantai point is that we cannot speak of\nanything finite without also involving some determination of the\nWhole, of the infinite. If we were to say this thing is sharp, we\nwould have to be assuming that \u201cthe whole universe is such that\nthis thing is sharp\u201d. We cannot say that: the whole universe\ncannot be \u201csuch that this marble is sharp\u201d any more than\nthe whole universe can be \u201csharp\u201d. But this also means we\ncannot say the whole universe is \u201csuch that this marble is\nnot-sharp\u201d. Either is equally legitimate, either is equally\nillegitimate. What we can say, then, is that this marble appears to be\nround, but round is such that it is always turning out also to be more\nthan round, to be non-round, and vice versa. Roundness is moretoitive.\nRound and non-round intersubsume each other.\n\nIn short, roundness is present as every non-roundness, and as\nmoretoitivity; moretoitivity is present as roundness, and as every\nnon-roundness. This it means to say \u201croundness and\nnon-roundness are neither same nor different.\u201d\n\nTo clarify this, consider the following:\n\nWhat is the following figure?\n\n\u039f\n\nWhat is that \u201csame\u201d figure in the diagram below?\n\n\u22122 \u22121 \u039f \u00a01 \u00a02\n\nWhat is it now?\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n \n\n\n\nN\n\n \n\n\u22122\n\u22121\n\u039f\n\u00a01\n\u00a02 \n\n\n\nP\n\n \n\n\n\nQ\n\n  \n\n\nHow about now:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u039f \n\n\n\nM\n\n \n\n\n\nN\n\n \n\n\u22122\n\u22121\n\u039f\n\u00a01\n\u00a02\n\u039f \n\n\n\nP\n\n \n\n\n\nQ\n\n  \n\n\nWhen we looked at that round figure in isolation, it may have\npresented itself immediately and unreflectively in accordance with our\nhabits or proximate mental acts; if we had been thinking about numbers\na moment ago, it might appear simply and unambiguously as\n\u201czero\u201d, if about letters as the letter \u201co\u201d, if\nabout shapes as a \u201ccircle\u201d. When a single explicit context\nwas added in the second diagram, it had a clear and definite identity:\nit was the number zero. But when we added another context at the same\ntime, in the third diagram, the figure became ambiguous: it could now\nbe read as either a zero or the letter O. As we keep adding more\ncontexts, its identity becomes more and more ambiguous; in the final\ndiagram above, we can point to the initial circular figure and say,\nvalidly, \u201cThis is a triangle\u201d\u2014for it is the\nvertex of a triangle formed with the two other, non-contiguous and\nnon-proximate, circles. Who knows what other circles there are out in\nthe world, and what other figures this thing right here is\nactually forming? When we consider all things in the universe at the\nsame time, the initial identities we assigned to them are supplemented\nby more and more ambiguity. Looking at just the single series of\nletters, is was a zero: this is local coherence. When we see this cup\nsimply as a cup, we are doing the same thing: ignoring a lot of other\nfactors, contexts, points of view, ways of viewing, and narrowing down\nthe relevant factors to allow it to appear as a single unambiguous\nsomething: a cup. If we consider the molecules of which it is made, or\nthe energy it expresses, or the uses to which it might be put in the\ncontext of various narratives, or its deep past and deep future, its\n\u201ccupness\u201d becomes ambiguous: it is simultaneously lots of\nother things, part of many different stories. It is a blip on the\nscreen of energy transformations, or a murder weapon, or an art\nobject, or a doorstop. The same is true of yourself, and your actions\nright now. They are unambiguous only to the extent that we narrow our\nvision around them (one way we can narrow our vision, of course, is to\ndo philosophy; one of the narratives in which we are contextualizing\nour experience might be a conceptual system presupposing the sorting\nout of essences, attributes, accidents, substantial forms or what have\nyou, and distinguishing appearances from reality accordingly, so that\nit appears to be \u201cessentially\u201d a cup and only\n\u201caccidentally\u201d a murder weapon and only \u201cappearing\nto be\u201d a revelation from Baal). This is the meaning of Emptiness\nin Tiantai: ontological ambiguity. The term \u201cambiguity\u201d\nusually refers only to how we see things. We assume that, in\nthemselves, everything simply is what it is; but we may have an\nunclear view of it; we can\u2019t yet tell if it\u2019s\nthis or that. We assume that, at least in principle, it must be one or\nthe other. The idea of Emptiness is the idea that this is true\n\u201contologically\u201d: that is, it pertains to the very being of\nthings. To say they are empty does not mean they are a blank\u2014for\nthat would be a definite something, a specific exclusion of all\ndeterminate content, which is, ipso facto, itself a\ndeterminate content. Emptiness here means rather that they are, in\nthemselves, ambiguous. Again, this is also to say that\neverything is more than it seems to be, or rather\nconstitutively more than it can seem to be, no matter what\nangles it is seen from, no matter how thoroughly it is known, no\nmatter how comprehensive a sum of information is gathered about it. It\nhas the character of being a \u201csomething\u201d (a cup, a chair,\nan elephant), with a number of specifiable characteristics, but every\n\u201csomething\u201d, just to be there as something, has the\nadditional characteristic of \u201cmoretoitivity\u201d\u2014of\nalways overflowing whatever is determined about it, of being\nmore than what can be seen from any angle.\n\nThis \u201cmore\u201d however, does not leave the original\n\u201cknown\u201d part unchanged. Rather, it recontextualizes it. We\nare always seeing the tip of an iceberg. But even the\n\u201ctip\u201d is no longer what we thought it was before we knew\nit was a tip of something more. The key here is that there is\nno total decontextualization, that leaving one context is always\nsimply entering another context; contextual relations do not require\nphysical contiguity, and the empty space surrounding a given thing\ndoes not cut it off from further recontextualizations but rather is\nitself a context, and an illimitable one that opens into infinite\nalternate contexts.\n",
