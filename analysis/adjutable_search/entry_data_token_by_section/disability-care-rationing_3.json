    "main_text": "Why does disability pose a problem for health care rationing? || The difference disability makes\n2.1 The difference disability makes\n\nThe situation of persons with disabilities is a special ethical\nconcern for health care allocation because disability is not just any\nhuman difference\u2014like age, gender or ethnicity\u2014or any\nsocial disadvantage\u2014like poverty, gender discrimination, or\nminority marginalization. Disability is both a difference and a\ndisadvantage that is conceptually linked to a person\u2019s\nhealth state, and therefore health needs. All disability theorists\nthese days agree that the physical, social and attitudinal environment\nin which a person with a health problem or functional impairment lives\nwill make a huge difference to their perceived\n\u201cdisability\u201d the person will experience (WHO\n2001). Although there are a few hold-outs of the so-called\n\u201csocial model\u201d that insist that disability is a pure\n\u201csocial construction\u201d that has nothing to do with the\nstate of a person\u2019s health (see Oliver 1990), the Consensus is\nthat disability is conceptually linked to health: without an\nunderlying health problem or impairment there is no disability.\n\nWhile the actual health needs of persons with disabilities, even\nsevere disabilities, varies enormously, the conceptual link to health\nand human functioning means that health is not merely contingently\nrelated to disability, as gender, poverty or even quality of life are.\nMoreover, disability is not merely conceptually linked to health, it\nis linked to some problem with or decrement in health. This explains\nwhy the case of disability raises the priority problem in clear\nrelief: every person with a disability is potentially a less-efficient\nhealth care resource user since they have an ex ante\n(pre-allocation) health problem. \n\nIt is important to note, however, that disability is not conceptually\nlinked to (lower) quality of life. Unfortunately, there is good\nevidence that it is commonly believed that people with disabilities\nsuffer from a lower quality of life associated with their level of\nfunctioning or premature mortality, and that ex ante\ndecrement in quality of life may not be fundamentally altered by the\nhealth resource (Albrecht & Devlieger 1999). This empirical fact\nis the source of the democracy problem as it applies to disability\nsince if the general public is laboring under a general prejudice\nabout what it means to live with a disability, then they will be more\neasily persuaded that disability is an additional cost, or limits the\nbenefit received (or both).\n\nTo be sure, there can be no doubt that disability incurs additional\npersonal and social costs in the form of impairment-related resources\nsuch as assistive technology (wheelchairs, hearing aids, and augmented\ncommunication devices); changes to make their world more accessible\n(curb cuts, audible stop lights, elevators, accessible toilets and\ndisability parking); and social services such as income maintenance,\ndisability pensions and vocational rehabilitation. By the same token\nthe health care needs of persons with disabilities may be more costly\nto provide, given potential complications and co-morbidities as well\nas the accommodations that may be required to ensure access to health\ncare (for example, that examination tables can accommodate persons\nwith complete lower body paralysis). Because of this, however, people\nwith disabilities will always have to face the converse of the\nindirect benefits problem: as a population, they incur health and\nnon-health costs that, if factored into the cost of the health\nimprovement associated with a health resource, would tilt the CEA\nefficiency calculation against them.\n",
