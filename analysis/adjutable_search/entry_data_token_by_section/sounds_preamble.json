    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophy of perception typically centered on colors, as did the\nmetaphysics of mind when discussing the mind-dependence of secondary\nqualities. Possibly, the philosophical privilege of the visible just\nreflects the cognitive privilege of the visible\u2014as vision is\nconsidered to account for most of useful sensory information\ngathering.\n\nWhat makes sounds worth of philosophical analysis is that they are not\nonly an important element of the perceptual scene but are also\nphilosophically idiosyncratic in many intriguing ways; in particular,\ntheir temporal and spatial unfolding, as presented in perception, has\ninteresting metaphysical and epistemological aspects. There is,\nhowever, an advantage of the neglect. Many philosophical aspects of\nsound and sound perception are not idiosyncratic and indeed make for\ngeneral issues in philosophy of perception. Hence in this article we\nwill take advantage of the many discussions that have used other\nsensory features such as colors as a paradigm of a sensory feature.\nFor instance, we shall not rehearse the discussion about the\nsubjectivity of secondary qualities, as the example of sounds does not\nseem to introduce new philosophically interesting elements that could\nchallenge generalizations obtained, say, from the example of\ncolors.\n\nThe main issues which are on the table concern the nature of sounds.\nSounds enter the content of auditory perception. But what are they?\nAre sounds individuals? Are they events? Are they properties of\nsounding objects? If they are events, what type of event are they?\nWhat is the relation between sounds and sounding objects? Temporal and\ncausal features of sounds will be important in deciding these and\nrelated questions. However, it turns out that a fruitful way to\norganize these issues deals with the spatial properties of sounds.\n\nIndeed, the various philosophical pronouncements about the nature of\nsounds can be rather neatly classified according to the spatial status\neach of them assigns to sounds. Where are sounds? Are they anywhere?\nThe main relevant families of answers include proximal, medial,\ndistal, and aspatial theories. Proximal theories would claim that\nsounds are where the hearer is. Medial theories\u2014exemplified by\nmainstream acoustics\u2014locate sounds in the medium between the\nresonating object and the hearer. Distal theories consider sounds to\nbe located at the resonating object. Finally, aspatial theories deny\nspatial relevance to sounds. There are significant variants of each of\nthese. Sound theories can also be classified according to other\ndimensions, such as the metaphysical status they accord to sounds (for\ninstance, as occurring events as opposed to properties or\ndispositions). We shall see some of the interactions between these\ndifferent accounts. For a discussion that is more focused on perception,\nsee the entry on \n auditory perception.\n",
