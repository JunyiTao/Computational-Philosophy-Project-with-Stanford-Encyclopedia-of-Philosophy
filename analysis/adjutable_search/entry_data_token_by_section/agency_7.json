    "main_text": "The metaphysics of agency\n3. The metaphysics of agency\nWhat is the nature of agency? How should we construe the relation\nbetween agents and actions? How can agency be part of the event-causal\norder? In this section, we will first turn to the three main\napproaches in the metaphysics of agency that provide three different\nframeworks for how to think about such metaphysical questions (the\nevent-causal, the agent-causal, and the volitionist framework). After\nconsidering some problems and objections, we turn to an alternative\napproach that rejects the project of providing a metaphysics of agency\n(dual standpoint theory). Finally, we briefly consider the\nindividuation of actions and some further issues in the metaphysics of\nagency.\n",
