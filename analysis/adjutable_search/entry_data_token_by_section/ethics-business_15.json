    "main_text": "Firms and workers || Meaningful work\n6.3 Meaningful work\n\nSmith (1776 [1976]) famously observed that a detailed division of\nlabor greatly increases the productivity of manufacturing processes.\nTo use his example: if one worker performs all of the tasks required\nto make a pin himself\u201418, we are told\u2014he can make just a\nfew pins per day. However, if the worker specializes in one or two of\nthese tasks, and combines his efforts with other workers who\nspecialize in one or two of the other tasks, then together they can\nmake thousands of pins per day. But according to Smith, there is human\ncost to the detailed division of labor. Performing one or two simple\ntasks all day makes a worker \u201cas stupid and ignorant as it is\npossible for a human creature to become\u201d (Smith 1776 [1976]:\nV.1.178).\n\nTo avoid this result, some call for work to be made more\n\u201cmeaningful\u201d. In this sense, a call for meaningful work is\nnot a call for work to be more \u201cimportant\u201d, i.e., to\ncontribute to the production of a good or service that is objectively\nvaluable, or that workers believe is valuable (cf. Michaelson 2021;\nVeltman 2016). Instead, it is a call for labor processes to be\narranged so that work is interesting, requires skill, and gives\nworkers substantial decision-making power (Arneson 1987; Roessler\n2012; Schwartz 1982).\n\nSmith\u2019s insight that labor processes are more efficient when\nthey are divided into meaningless segments leads some writers to\nbelieve that, in a competitive economy, firms will not provide as much\nmeaningful work as workers want (Werhane 1985). In response, it has\nbeen argued that there is a market for labor, and if workers want\nmeaningful work, then employers have an incentive to provide it\n(Maitland 1989; Nozick 1974). According to this argument, insofar as\nwe see \u201ctoo little\u201d meaningful work on offer, this is\nbecause workers prefer not to have it\u2014or more precisely, because\nworkers are willing to trade meaningfulness for other benefits, such\nas higher wages.\n\nThe above argument treats meaningful work as a matter of preference,\nas a job amenity that employers can decline to offer or that workers\ncan trade away (cf. Yeoman 2014). Others resist this understanding.\nAccording to Schwartz (1982), employers are required to offer\nemployees meaningful work, and employees are required to perform it,\nout of respect for autonomy (see also Bowie 2017). The idea is that\nthe autonomous person makes choices for herself; she does not\nmindlessly follow others\u2019 directions. A difficulty for this\nargument is that respect for autonomy does not seem to require that we\nmake all choices for ourselves. A person might, it seems,\nautonomously choose to allow important decisions to be made for her in\ncertain spheres of her life, e.g., by a coach, a family member, a\nmedical professional, or a military commander.\n\nA potential problem for this response brings us back to Smith, and to\n\u201cformative\u201d arguments for meaningful work. The problem,\naccording to some writers, is that if most of a person\u2019s day is\ngiven over to meaningless tasks, then her capacity for autonomous\nchoice, and perhaps her other intellectual faculties, may deteriorate.\nA call for meaningful work may be understood as a call for workplaces\nto be arranged so that this deterioration does not occur (Arneson\n2009; Arnold 2012; Yeoman 2014). In addition to Smith, Marx (1844\n[2000]) was concerned about the effects of work on human\nflourishing.\n\nFormative arguments face at least two difficulties, one empirical and\none normative. The empirical difficulty is establishing the connection\nbetween meaningless work and autonomous choice (or another\nintellectual faculty). More evidence is needed. The normative\ndifficulty is that formative arguments make certain assumptions about\nthe nature of the good and the state\u2019s role in promoting it.\nThey assume that it is better for people to have fully developed\nfaculties of autonomous choice (etc.) and that the state should help\nto develop them. These assumptions might be challenged, e.g., by\nliberal neutralists (Roessler 2012; Veltman 2016). Yeoman (2014) seeks\nto surmount this challenge\u2014and make meaningful work safe for\nliberal political theory\u2014by conceptualizing meaningful work as a\nfundamental human need, not a mere preference.\n",
