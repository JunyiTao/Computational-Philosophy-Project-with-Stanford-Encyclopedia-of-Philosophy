    "main_text": "Buridan\u2019s Theory of Singular Terms\n9. Buridan\u2019s Theory of Singular Terms\n \n\nJohn Buridan was the medieval author who produced the fullest and most\ncoherent account of singular terms. In his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nDe anima, Buridan claims that the vague individual is the most\nproper singular term. While it is true that the phrase \u2018this\nman\u2019 can lack reference through improper use, if it is used\nproperly it must point to one united existent present object, the very\nsituation in which we form genuinely singular concepts. Demonstrative\nphrases are so clearly tied to the here-and-now that no problem of\nidentity through time can arise. On the other hand, this allows for\nonly a very time-bound usage. In his consideration of whether the\nsingular term \u2018Socrates\u2019 could be defined by the phrase\n\u2018this man\u2019, Buridan remarked that if Socrates leaves the\nroom, he is still Socrates, but he is no longer the referent of\n\u2018this man\u2019. \n\n\nBuridan\u2019s view of vague individuals was related to his discussion of\nAristotle\u2019s claim (Physics 1 184a22\u201324) that we must proceed\nfrom universals to particulars. On the one hand, he insisted that\ncognition can only begin when a singular thing is present to the\nsenses; on the other hand, he argued that our cognition must move from\nthe more general to the less general, because it requires more skill\nto grasp the less general. Adults, he remarked, distinguish easily\nbetween dogs and cats, but small children do not.  Instead of\nsupposing that the only appropriate singular is Socrates, Buridan\nargued that for each level of generality, there is an appropriate\nvague singular. First we cognize this body, then we cognize this\nanimal, and then we cognize this man.  This account of the standard\nprogression allows recognition both of the primacy of singulars, and\nof the move from more to less general. It depends on Buridan\u2019s\nepistemological claim that general notions are always involved in\napprehension, and that what makes an apprehension singular is the\n\u2018confusion\u2019 or fusing together of circumstances, so that\nbeing a man is not abstracted from being here and now in such and such\na way. Singularity is not tied to the absence of generality, but to\nthe presence of \u2018confusion\u2019 or the lack of\ndiscrimination. In other words, a concept can be semantically simple\nor singular while being metaphysically rich. It has a complex content\nwithout being compositional, and without the elements having been\ndistinguished from one another.\n\n\nJohn Dorp recognized that Buridan\u2019s account depends on the claim that\nwe can grasp generality directly, and that what makes a concept\nsingular is not the absence of generality but the fact that the\ngeneral has not yet been separated from the set of particular\ncircumstances. Dorp rejected this account, and argued that we have no\nsuch singular term as a vague individual in our language. To cognize a\nthing as singular must involve cognition of particular circumstances,\nand the general concept \u2018man\u2019 cannot be part of the\nsingular cognition. If we want to introduce vague singulars into our\nlanguage, we will have to invent some special term, such as\n\u2018a\u2019, to signify Socrates together with a connotation of\nall the individual circumstances, and \u2018a\u2019 will then count\nas a vague singular. Dorp\u2019s view was not adopted any more than was\nBuridan\u2019s own.  For most later logicians, the vague singular was\n(contrary to Dorp) one type of singular term, but (contrary to\nBuridan) less properly singular than the proper name, on the grounds\nthat it did indeed involve some generality. \n\n\nBuridan\u2019s treatment of proper names depends on his insistence that a\nsingular term must be subordinated to a singular concept, and that the\nformation of a singular concept depends on the actual presence of the\nsingular thing. No one can hand on a singular concept to another by\ndefinition or explanation. In his Questiones in\nMetaphysicam, Buridan considered the names\n\u2018Antichrist\u2019 and \u2018Aristotle\u2019. He argued that\n\u2018Antichrist\u2019, the favorite example of a name referring to\na person who does not yet exist, is not a singular term, since it is\nformed from \u2018anti\u2019 and \u2018Christ\u2019, and could\napply to many individuals. He then turned to his own favourite\nexample, \u2018Aristotle\u2019.  If I am in the presence of\nAristotle, and I dub him \u2018Aristotle\u2019, then the name is a\ngenuinely singular term. But if Aristotle is a figure in the distant\npast, then my concept of Aristotle must be a descriptive one,\ncontaining such general elements as \u2018man\u2019, \u2018great\nphilosopher\u2019, \u2018born in Greece\u2019, and so on. Given that there was\nindeed such a man, having just those characteristics, then my concept\nsupposits for Aristotle, and so stability of reference is guaranteed,\nbut since the concept is not and cannot be a singular concept, it\nseems that \u2018Aristotle\u2019 cannot be a proper singular term\nwhen uttered by me, but only an individual by circumlocution. \n\n\nBuridan adds a very important clause to his discussion at this\npoint. He remarks that I can treat \u2018Aristotle\u2019 as a\nsingular term because I believe that the name was imposed or given its\nsignification by a person who did have the appropriate singular\nconcept. This move allows him to avoid the awkward consequence that\nwhether \u2018Aristotle\u2019 is a proper name or not depends\nentirely on the experience of the speakers, and not at all on the\nlinguistic practices of the community.  If I have never known\nAristotle, but am speaking with someone who did know him, we can both\nbe taken to be using a proper name when we utter the word\n\u2018Aristotle\u2019.  Buridan\u2019s remarks can be expanded in at\nleast two closely related ways. On the one hand, given his references\nto an original baptism or name-giving ceremony, we can regard Buridan\nas offering an early hint of the historical chain theory of proper\nnames. On the other hand, given his apparent recognition that the\nspeaker\u2019s intention to refer to the person who was baptized is related\nto a body of information which, accurate or not, is causally connected\nwith the man baptized \u2018Aristotle\u2019, perhaps Buridan is\nnearer to the richer causal account given by Gareth Evans.  Buridan\u2019s\nhints were picked up, though not developed, by later authors. For\ninstance, Dorp remarked that we treat such names as\n\u2018Aristotle\u2019 as singular because they were singular for the\noriginal impositor.\n\n\nThe importance of some sort of causal link between the original\nproducer of the name and the individual named and its relation to the\nrepresentative nature of even singular concepts was brought out by\nBuridan and Dorp in their discussion of two cases. In the first case,\nPlato and Socrates are exactly similar and, without my knowing it, one\nreplaces the other in my field of sight. Buridan and Dorp argue that\nwhile my first-formed singular concept is equally similar to the\nsecond person to appear, it is not a concept of him, because it is\ncaused by a different individual. The criterion for distinction is not\nthe fit between concept and object but the causal relation.  The\nsecond case was discussed by Dorp alone.  If identical twins are born,\nand are both called \u2018Socrates\u2019, it may seem that\n\u2018Socrates\u2019 will function as a common name in this case,\nbecause the concepts will be exactly alike, but here too the causal\nrelation becomes all-important.  There are two singular terms, each\nwith its own signification.\n",
