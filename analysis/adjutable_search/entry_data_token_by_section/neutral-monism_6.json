    "main_text": "Traditional Versions of Neutral Monism || Bertrand Russell\n2.3 Bertrand Russell\n\nFollowing a series of critical engagements with neutral monism (see\nespecially Russell 1914a,b), Russell adopted it in 1918 and remained a\nneutral monist for the rest of his long career: \u201cI am conscious\nof no major change in my opinions since the adoption of neutral\nmonism\u201d is what he says in an interview from 1964 (Eames 1969:\n108). But the question of whether Russell\u2019s neutral monism is\nbest seen as a single theory or as a sequence of related but\nsignificantly different theories, as well as the question of which, if\nany, of these different doctrines should count as versions of neutral\nmonism, have been much debated (see Wishon 2015; Pincock 2018; Bostock\n2012; Stace 1946). Russell\u2019s 1919 and 1921 are generally\nconsidered to represent the early versions of his neutral monism.\nRussell\u2019s 1927a and 1927b contain the mature doctrine. In his\nlater works\u2014Russell 1948 and 1956a\u2014he no longer used the\nterm \u201cneutral monism\u201d. But the doctrine seems largely\nunchanged.\n\nHere is a succinct first pass at describing the core of\nRussell\u2019s neutral monism:\n\nRussell argued that the traditional distinction between\n\u201cmind\u201d and \u201cmatter\u201d is unfounded and that the\nsubject matter of both physics and psychology concerns collections of\ncausally ordered events in space-time. Some of these events, ones\noccurring in the brains of complex creatures like us, are the mental\nepisodes that we are directly aware of in having conscious experience.\nThese very same events can also be described in abstract structural\nterms by physics and neuroscience. Regarding the rest of the\n(extracranial) events in nature, Russell maintained that our knowledge\nof them is indirect and limited entirely to the abstract structural\ndescriptions provided by the various physical sciences. (Wishon 2016:\n64)\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, this brief summary leaves out many key details that\nare important for understanding the character of Russell\u2019s\nneutral monism.\n2.3.1 Logical Constructionism and Neutral Monism\n\nWhen Russell looks at neutral monism, he sees a theory that embodies\nthe spirit of the \u201csupreme maxim in scientific\nphilosophising\u201d (Russell 1914c: 155) in an especially striking\nway. This maxim is Occam\u2019s Razor: entities are not to be\nmultiplied without necessity. In one of Russell\u2019s formulations\nit reads: \u201cWherever possible, substitute constructions out of\nknown entities for inferences to unknown entities\u201d (Russell\n1924: 326). Known entities are those that we know directly or\nnoninferentially; unknown entities are ones we accept only on the\nbasis of inferences from known entities. Russell\u2019s maxim\nencourages us to discover complex structures of known entities that\ncan play the role the inferred entities were supposed to play. Upon\nsubstituting these complex structures\u2014the\nconstructions\u2014for the inferred entities, everything continues to\nwork as before. The point of this complicated procedure is primarily\nepistemic: we are now no longer burdened with the risky inference to\nthe inferred entities, and thus the risk of error is reduced. Strictly\nspeaking, Russell remains agnostic as to the existence of the original\nentities targeted by the construction. They are neither identified\nwith nor eliminated by the corresponding construction. Still, the\nconstructions make it possible to arrive at a simplified account of\nwhat there is that fits our empirical evidence and exhibits various\nother theoretical virtues such as greater continuity, causal\nuniformity, and so on. Thus, the resulting metaphysical theory\ndeserves our provisional assent over competing ones to a degree\nproportional to such non-demonstrative grounds.\n\nNeutral monism holds out the alluring promise that such constructions\ncan be found for all of the inferred entities of physics, psychology,\nand common sense. All of these bodies of knowledge are preserved, but\nat a hugely reduced epistemic cost. These are the considerations that\ndrive Russell to embrace neutral monism: it is a perfect fit with his\nlongstanding commitment to the program of logical construction. An\nadded benefit of substituting constructions of neutral entities for\nphysical and mental entities is an elegant solution to the mind-body\nproblem.\n\nLogical construction is a process of discovery, not of manipulation:\nto logically construct xs out of ys is to discover\nthat ys, when they manifest a certain type of structure, can\nplay the role of xs. Russell\u2019s constructions of a point\nin space, an instant in time, a table, and of a belief may illustrate\nthe procedure. (i) A Russian doll is a good model of how Russell\n(following Whitehead) proposes to construct a point in space. The\nrough idea is to take \u201cthe class of all those objects which, as\none would naturally say, contain the point\u201d (Russell 1914a: 117)\nand to substitute this class of nested objects (the structure of\nys) for points in space (the xs). (ii) Experienced\ninstants in time (the xs) are constructed by discovering that\nthe experiences of a person, each of which is extended in time, can\noverlap each other in ways that converge on an instant. It is\n\na group of events, all belonging to his experience, and having the\nfollowing two properties: (1) any two of the events overlap; (2) no\nevent outside the group overlaps with every member of the group.\n(Russell 1927b: 288)\n\n\n(iii) Rather than viewing a table as the cause of our table\nsensations, Russell proposes (again just as a first approximation) to\nview the table as \u201cthe set of all those particulars which would\nnaturally be called \u2018aspects\u2019 of the table from different\npoints of view\u201d (Russell 1921: 98). (iv) The logical\nconstruction that is to take the place of beliefs consists of the\nfollowing three components:\n\nWe have a proposition, consisting of interrelated images, and possibly\npartly of sensations; (b) we have the feeling of assent, which is\npresumably a complex sensation demanding analysis; (c) we have a\nrelation, actually subsisting, between the assent and the proposition,\nsuch as is expressed by saying that the proposition in question is\nwhat is assented to. (Russell 1921: 251)\n\n\nAs these examples show, there is no single method of construction, no\nsingle type of structure, suitable for different projects of logical\nconstruction. The nature of the xs (the targets of\nconstruction) and of the ys (the construction materials)\nguide the search for structures that will work in the case at\nhand.\n2.3.2 Known Neutral Entities\n\nThe initial stock of known entities with which Russell proposes to\ncarry out this grand project of logical construction seems frightfully\nsmall and strikingly non-neutral. It consists of his sensations and\nimages\u2014these loom large in Russell 1919, 1921\u2014and his\nperceptions (percepts)\u2014these play a prominent role in Russell\n1927a, 1927b, 1948. Everything else\u2014electrons, apples, galaxies,\nexperiences, and selves, etc.\u2014is in need of logical\nconstruction.\n\nFor an entity to be neutral is to \u201chave neither the hardness and\nindestructibility of matter, nor the reference to objects which is\nsupposed to characterize the mind\u201d (Russell 1921: 36; cf. 124).\nRussell never suspected sensations of being material (in this sense).\nThat sensations contain a mental element (in this sense)\u2014that\nthey consist of a mental act of sensing directed at a non-mental\nobject\u2014was, however, a pivotal part of his earlier view. But\nthen his views changed:\n\nI formerly believed that my own inspection showed me the distinction\nbetween a noise [the object] and my hearing of a noise [the act of\nsensing], and I am now convinced that it shows me no such thing, and\nnever did. (Russell 1918b: 255)\n\n\nAll that Russell now finds upon introspecting a sensory episode is a\nsingle item: a sensory quality \u201cwhich may be called\nindifferently a noise or hearing a noise\u201d (Russell 1918b: 255).\nSwitching the example to colors, he writes that\n\nthe sensation we have when we see a patch of colour simply is\nthat patch of colour\u2026the patch of colour and our sensation in\nseeing it are identical. (Russell 1921: 142\u20133)\n\n\nAnd since noises and patches of color are not intentional\u2014they\nare not directed at anything, they are simply there\u2014they are\nintrinsically non-mental. They constitute \u201csensations\u201d\nonly when related to other such entities in an organized system such\nthat they play the right causal role (Russell 1996; Wishon\n2020, 2021). This establishes the neutrality of sensations. And\nbecause images have the same intrinsic nature as sensations (cf.\nRussell 1921: 117, 121, 154, 156, 287, 297), they too are\n neutral.[6]\n Percepts are composed of elements playing the roles of sensations and\nimages and are likewise intrinsically neutral.\n2.3.3 More Neutral Entities: Realism\n\nRussell\u2019s focus on sensations, images, and percepts explains why\nRussell\u2019s neutral monism has often been dismissed as a form of\nphenomenalism. But in the preceding section we have seen how Russell\nargued for the intrinsic nonmentality of these items. Moreover, this\ncriticism overlooks that Russell worked with a vastly expanded set of\nconstruction materials. He allows for the enlargement of the realm of\nthe known by a series of cautious\n inferences.[7]\n In a first step he argues that \u201call our percepts are composed\nof imperceptible parts\u201d and have imperceptible structure\n(Russell 1927a: 282, 386; Wishon 2020, 2021); second, there are\nsensations, images, and percepts that are not our own; third, and most\nimportantly, we can infer the existence of vast numbers of entities\nthat \u201cdo not form part of any experience\u201d (Russell 1921:\n 25).[8]\n In this way Russell arrives at the view \u201cthat the world is very\nfull of events\u201d (Russell 1927a: 258), only a vanishingly small\nnumber of which are his own experiences.\n\nOur own percepts, images, and\n sensations[9]\n occupy a privileged place in this system of entities\u2014they are\n\u201cwhat is most indubitable in our knowledge of the world\u201d\n(Russell 1927b: 139). This knowledge is of a \u201cmore intimate\nqualitative\u201d (Russell 1927a: 389) kind; it reveals something of\nthe intrinsic character of these\n entities.[10]\n But our knowledge of the physical world [as described by physical\nscience] is (almost) entirely abstract: \u201cwe know certain logical\ncharacteristics of its structure, but nothing of its intrinsic\ncharacter\u201d (Russell 1927b:\n 306\u2013307).[11]\n In this sense, physics merely describes the \u201ccausal skeleton of\nthe world\u201d and leaves us in the dark as to the intrinsic quality\nof the events that make it up (Russell 1927a: 388, 391).\n\nRussell takes all of these different entities to be neutral (in the\nsense of the Neither View); and he takes all of them to be\n events[12],\n where an event is understood as \u201csomething occupying a small\nfinite amount of space\u2013time\u201d (Russell 1927b: 287). The\nnoise and the color patch considered above are typical examples of\nevents. A Russellian event is absolute, in C.D. Broad\u2019s sense:\n\u201cit should not itself be a state of invariance or of\nchange in the qualities or relationships of any thing\u201d (Broad\n1959: 739; see also Maxwell 1978: 385\u20136 on pure events).\nAccording to Russell, physics teaches that events \u201cjust happen,\nand do not happen \u2018to\u2019 matter or \u2018to\u2019 anything\nelse\u201d (Russell 1927b: 289). This means that we must not think of\nmental events (or any events) \u201cas consisting of motions of bits\nof matter\u201d (Russell 1927b: 292), for \u201cmatter in\nmotion\u2026is not an event in our sense\u201d (Russell 1927b:\n296).\n\nRussell\u2019s neutral monist universe is a plenum of (absolute)\nevents\u2014a vast assemblage of overlapping small occurrences which,\ngiven their short lifespan, are constantly replaced by new ones. This\nmass of ever-changing events manifests all sorts of complex dynamic\npatterns. We have not yet discovered the laws that govern these events\nand give rise to the formation of these complex dynamic patterns. But\nwe have physics, which describes the behavior of certain groups of\nlaw-governed events under the name of \u201cmatter\u201d. And we\nhave psychology, which describes a set of quite different regularities\nthat obtain in very specific regions of this plenum of\nevents\u2014viz. in those regions that are filled by the pieces of\nmatter that are called \u201cbrains\u201d. But all the building\nblocks of the logical constructions that are matter, and all the\nbuilding blocks of the logical constructions that are mental episodes,\nhave the same nature\u2014they are neutral events.\n",
