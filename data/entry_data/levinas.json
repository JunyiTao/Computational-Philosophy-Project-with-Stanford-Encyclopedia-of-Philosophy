    "preamble": "\n\nEmmanuel Levinas\u2019 (1905\u20131995) intellectual project was to\ndevelop a first philosophy. Whereas traditionally first philosophy\ndenoted either metaphysics or theology, only to be reconceived by\nHeidegger as fundamental ontology, Levinas argued that it is ethics\nthat should be so conceived. But rather than formulating an ethical\ntheory, Levinas developed his philosophy in opposition to\nboth these aforementioned approaches. It takes the form of a\ndescription and interpretation of the event of encountering another\n person.[1]\n Giving rise to spontaneous acts of responsibility for others, the\nencounter unfolds, according to Levinas, at a precognitive level,\nthanks to what he called our embodied\n \u201csensibility\u201d.[2]\n That is why a phenomenology of intersubjective responsibility would\nbe \u2018first\u2019 philosophy; viz., in the sense of\ninterpretively reconstructing a level of experience precursive to both\nreflective activity and practical interests. \n\nSome commentators have called Levinas\u2019 work an ethics of ethics,\nothers a meta-ethics, while still others have urged that his thought\ncan accommodate many ethical theories, from intuitionism to\nrationalism (see below). However that may be, his work is in\nongoing, critical dialogue with three philosophers: Husserl,\nHeidegger, and Hegel. Given these targets\u2014as well as\nphilosophical interlocutors like Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty\u2014Levinas\u2019 philosophy begins from an enlarged\nconception of lived embodiment and a powerful extension of\nHusserl\u2019s technique of suspending conceptualization to reveal\nexperience as it comes to light. He is also indebted to Heidegger for\nhis hermeneutics of being-in-the-world. \n",

Thematic Exposition of Levinas\u2019 Philosophy\n\nThis entry will follow Levinas\u2019 career chronologically, as his\nconcepts evolve. In what follows, we will emphasize the following\narguments and themes: (1) why Levinas\u2019 is a unique first\nphilosophy; (2) how he developed his investigation of the lived\nconditions of possibility of our concern with ethical reasoning; and\n(3) the originality of his adaptation of phenomenology and his\nexistentialist hermeneutics of pre-intentional embodied\nintersubjectivity. In this entry, attention is focused throughout to\nthe contribution of commentators, with a view to providing a gateway\nto recent secondary literature.\n2.1 Philosophical Beginnings: On Escape (1935) or Transcendence as the Need to Escape\n\nLevinas published his thesis, The Theory of Intuition in\nHusserl\u2019s Phenomenology, in 1930. It was the first\nbook-length introduction to Husserl\u2019s thought in French. By\nfocusing on the theme of intuition, Levinas established what\nphilosophical readers find notably in Husserl\u2019s Ideas I\nand II (published in 1913 and, for Ideas II, partially in\n1930): every human experience is open to phenomenological description;\nevery human experience carries meaning from the outset, and can be\nexamined as a mode of intentionality (Ideas II: \u00a756 h and\n\u00a7\u00a757\u201361). The following year, he published his\nco-translation of Husserl\u2019s Cartesian Meditations, in\nwhich Husserl had laid out a systematic presentation of transcendental\nphenomenology. In the 1930s, Levinas continued to publish studies of\nthe thought of his two principal teachers, Husserl and Heidegger.\nThese included the essays \u201cMartin Heidegger and Ontology\u201d\n(EDE: 53\u201376) and the extensive \u201cThe Work of Edmund\nHusserl\u201d (DEH: 47\u201389). In the 1930s and 1940s, his\nphilosophical project was influenced by Husserl\u2019s\nphenomenological method, whose foundation arguably lay in the\ncentrality of the \u201ctranscendental ego\u201d (Ideas I:\n\u00a749). However, suspicious of the intellectualism of\nHusserl\u2019s approach to essences (phenomenological\n\u201ceidetics\u201d), Levinas gravitated toward Heidegger\u2019s\nmore worldly approach to existence in Being and\n Time.[3]\n Between 1930 and 1935, he will nevertheless turn away from\nHeidegger\u2019s approach to being and transcendence and develop the\noutlines of a new ontology. As we shall see, he will reconceive\ntranscendence as a need for escape from existence, and work out a\ndifferent analysis of lived time in that project.\n\nLevinas\u2019 first original essay, On Escape (De\nl\u2019\u00e9vasion, 1935), examined the relationship between\nthe embodied (sentient) self and the intentional\n ego[4]\n from the perspectives of physical and affective states including\nneed, pleasure, shame, and nausea. In this succinct philosophical\nwork, Levinas was less concerned than was Heidegger with the question\nof existence as it opens up before us when we experience the\ndissolving of things in the world in anxiety (he-BT:\n \u00a740).[5]\n Levinas\u2019 question was not: \u201cWhy is there being instead of\nsimply nothing?\u201d His concern was to approach existence\ndifferently, through the (human) being as Heidegger had also done, but\nin light of more embodied experiences like the above-mentioned ones\n(OE: \u00a76). Enlarging Heidegger\u2019s hermeneutics of\nbeing-in-the-world, Levinas gave priority to lived moods and physical\nstates that revealed existence as oppressive and indeterminate.\nIndeed, in escapism and its various aesthetic expressions, we discover\nhumans\u2019 failed attempts to get away from the being that they\nthemselves are. \u201cEscape\u201d, he wrote, \n\n\nis the need to get out of oneself, that is, to break that most radical\nand unalterably binding of chains, the fact that the I [moi]\nis oneself [soi-m\u00eame]. (OE: \u00a71) \n\n\nIn the two imbricated dimensions of human life, sentient-affective and\nintentional, our experience of being comes to pass, in the\nrelationship between body and egoic consciousness.\n\nLevinas\u2019 youthful project approached transcendence secularly, in\nlight of humans\u2019 irreducible urge to get past the limits of\ntheir physical and social circumstances. His transcendence is less a\nquestion of cognition reaching reality or humans seeking to pass\n\u2018beyond\u2019 themselves (respectively he-BT: \u00a7\u00a743,\n10) than transcendence attempted through sensuous evasions. This quite\nmaterialist approach to transcendence is nevertheless motivated by the\nquestion of our mortality and finite being, but unlike Heidegger, it\nalso examines the enigma called infinity.\n\nLevinas thus accepted Heidegger\u2019s arguments that a human being\nexperiences itself as if thrown into its world (he-BT: \u00a738),\nwithout cognitive mastery over its birth and death. Heidegger\u2019s\nhuman being, or Da-sein (being-there), lives out its time\nprojecting itself toward its diverse possibilities. It flees its\nuncanny thrownness by distracting itself in social pursuits, a\nposition that Levinas will not adopt. On the other hand, the\nprojective element of transcendence, which Heidegger described in\nThe Basic Problems of Phenomenology\n (he-BPP)[6]\n as merely a \u201cstepping over to \u2026 as such\u201d, was of\ngreat interest to Levinas. But he would enquire: to what and from what\nare we \u2018stepping over\u2019? Levinas then observed: \n\n\n[M]odern sensibility wrestles with problems that indicate \u2026 the\nabandonment of this concern with transcendence. As if it had the\ncertainty that the idea of the limit could not apply to the\nexistence of what is \u2026 and as if modern sensibility\nperceived in being a defect still more profound. (OE:\n\u00a71, emph. added)\n\n\nHis argument here concerns a conceit of our \u2018modern\u2019\nsensibility (and philosophy); namely, that we presume we could\nthoughtfully frame a better conception of being, wherein existence was\nin some sense self-sufficient. What Levinas calls the\n\u201cinsufficiency of the human condition\u201d (OE: \u00a71)\nsimply denotes the limitation of our existence, whose transcendence,\nwhen understood as escape, promises that we might somehow surpass it,\nas if through an infinite experience. When transcendence is removed\nfrom theological or metaphysical frameworks (i.e., secularized as\nHeidegger\u2019s \u201cstepping over\u201d), then we grasp it in\nits historical context-dependency, as the illusions of a finite being\npondering pure self-sufficiency. Reconceived in this way, the entire\nquestion of transcendence changes, revealing the struggle to get out\nof our all too finite existence. That is why Levinas asks: \u201c[Is]\nthe need for escape not the exclusive matter of a finite\nbeing? \u2026 Would an infinite being have the need to take leave of\nitself\u201d (OE: \u00a72)? In short, is our first response to\nmortality not the urge to take leave of our existence, if\nperiodically? This question is not so different from Heidegger\u2019s\nconception of inauthenticity. But unlike Heidegger, true authenticity\ndoes not lie in securing our freedom for our most personal\npossibility, death. Levinas argued that we can approach death as\npossibility only through that of others and that we grasp being as\nfinite by way of their mortality. On the other hand, when secularized,\nthe idea of infinity refers to something absolute in human\nconsciousness (OE: \u00a71), which motivates our repeated efforts at\nescaping ourselves into various ecstasies. This is clearly a\nconception of being different from Heidegger\u2019s. Later, of\ncourse, Levinas will attribute infinity to a different experience,\nthat of the unbounded quality of the face of the other. However,\nintersubjectivity is little discussed in the 1935 essay. The encounter\nwith the other first comes into view as a theme in his 1940s works (TO\nand EE). Significant here, nevertheless, are the following two points:\n(1) Levinas\u2019 argument that Heidegger\u2019s conception of\nexistence is specific to a history, that of German thought and that of\nhermeneutics; (2) to be an embodied psyche is to struggle with the\nlimits of one\u2019s facticity or existential situation, and it is\nthere that the question of being as our existence initially\narises.\n\nHeidegger\u2019s Da-sein confronted the question of being\nwhen it found itself brought before itself in anxiety (he-BT:\n\u00a740). In contrast, Levinas proposed other ways by which the gap\nnarrows between being itself and the beings that we are. Following his\nleitmotif of our recurrent urge to escape, Levinas examined\nthe invariable disappointments following our attempts at transcending\nour existence: the aforementioned states of need and pleasure give way\nto a sobering up or disillusionment. In affective and physical states\nlike shame and nausea, the bodily self is experienced as a substance\ntrapped in its stifling existence and desperate for a way out.\nCommentator Jacques Rolland has explored Levinas\u2019 return to the\nbody, to concreteness, escape, and the way in which he deformalized\neven Heidegger\u2019s hermeneutics (OE: 29\u201332). Rolland adds\nthat this approach was inspired by Levinas\u2019 critical meditation,\npublished one year earlier (1934), on the materialist \u201cblood and\nsoil\u201d philosophy popular with National Socialism (RPH). As\nregards stifling existence, when Levinas refers to being, it is as\nongoing presence, rather than the event of disclosure that Heidegger\ndescribed. It remains a matter of debate whether this interpretation\nof being constitutes a step back to an older metaphysics prior to\nHeidegger\u2019s innovations, or not (Franck 2008: 31).\n\nWhether we choose to take Levinas\u2019 approach to being as\ndeformalizing Heidegger or as inspired by him, commentators often\nunderscore its fresh empiricism. Megan Craig compares the early works\nof Levinas with the \u201cradical empiricism\u201d of William James\n(Craig 2010: xv). Lisa Guenther, in turn, has examined embodiment and\nthe experience of maternity in the later Levinas (2006: 119\u2013136,\nsee \u00a73.4.5). From the outset, the \u201cfact of existing\u201d\nrefers to philosophically unexplored phenomena of our embodiment, our\naforementioned I-self (moi-soi) dualism.\n\nPolemically, Levinas urged that the most extreme state he described,\nnausea, amounts to being-there, what Husserl\u2019s phenomenology\ncalled \u201cself-positing\u201d: \u201c\u2026 nausea posits\nitself not only as something absolute, but as the very act of\nself-positing: it is the affirmation itself of being\u201d (OE:\n\u00a76). Other forms of self-positing occur, of course, as this event\nrefers to the experience of unity between the embodied self and the\nego of intentions, or indeed between what Raoul Moati compared with\nthe \u201cfirst-\u201d and the \u201cthird-person\u201d\nperspectives (2012 [2017: 38\u201371]). Thus, in immediate\nexperience, I am my joy or my pain, provisionally, just as I\nmay observe myself joyful, like a third person. Nevertheless, our\nvarious efforts to get out of our concrete situations are not the same\nas what Heidegger deemed projections toward new possibilities, wherein\nour death lies at the end of all the others, as the ultimate limit, or\n\u201cpossibility of impossibility\u201d (he-BT: \u00a750). For\nLevinas, by contrast, escape represents a positive, dynamic need. In\nthis youthful work, he also rethinks need as fullness rather than as\nmere privation. As we indicated, he is working toward a different\nunderstanding of existence itself. Whether it is characterized by\npleasure or suffering, need is the very ground of that existence. A\nsecular transcendence responds to need, promising a path toward\n\u201csomething other than ourselves\u201d (OE: \u00a73), which is\nwhy the deep motivation of need is to get out of our finite condition.\nAlready by 1935, Levinas\u2019 ontology has displaced\nHeidegger\u2019s being in light of the dynamic relation between the\nsentient self and the intentional \u2018I\u2019; it has refocused\nattention on the present over Heidegger\u2019s emphasis on the\nfuture, and explored new modes by which we experience the being that\nwe are.\n\nReconceived as need, pleasure, and nausea, our attempts at\ntranscendence open access to an experience of time different from both\nAristotle\u2019s \u201cmeasure of motion\u201d, and the fullness of\nawaiting (the anticipated moment or khairos that Heidegger\ndeveloped in his early work). Pleasure and pain are intensities:\n\u201csomething like abysses, ever deeper, into which our\nexistence \u2026 hurls itself\u201d (OE: \u00a74). The priority of\npresent-time, concentrated into an extended now-moment is opened up\nthrough sensibility and affectivity. In pleasure as in pain, we\nneed\u2014not out of lack\u2014but in desire or in\nhope. \u201cPleasure is \u2026 nothing less than a concentration\nin the instant\u201d (OE: \u00a74). Over Heidegger\u2019s ongoing\nopenness to possibility (he-BT: \u00a731), the present of embodiment\nhere receives existential priority. Levinas\u2019 emphasis on the\npresent is a theme he never\n abandons.[7]\n Moreover, though he adapts it from Husserl\u2019s phenomenology of\n\u201cpsychic reality\u201d, he will also enrich\n it.[8]\n\n\nIn sum, Levinas\u2019 early essay is structured around his\nreconceptualization of fundamental existential categories. If\nHusserl\u2019s transcendental ego returns as the \u201cI\u201d of\nintentions in Levinas, it remains that the embodied self has\ngreat importance as the locus or situation from which egoic\ntranscendence arises (i.e., we wake up as if out of our sleeping body,\nour soi). If the self and \u201cI\u201d duality is where\nthe weight of being shows itself most clearly, most affectively, then\nthe precedence Heidegger accorded to the world and to being qua call\nare decisively displaced. As indicated earlier, the latter\u2019s\nfocus on being, as the event of disclosure and withdrawal, is\ninterpreted by Levinas in a pre-Heideggerian fashion, as the constant\npresence which Heidegger had characterized skeptically as\nmetaphysical. Levinas approaches that presence through modalizations\nprovided by sensations and affects that were unexplored by either\nHeidegger or Husserl.\n\nIn 1935, Levinas was convinced that through sensation and states of\nmind we also discover the futility of getting out of existence. In the\nphysical torment of nausea, we experience being in its simplest, most\nburdensome neutrality. To this, Levinas adds three provocative themes.\nFirst, if being is disclosed only through the being that we are, then\nany being that seeks to escape itself because it feels trapped in its\nown facticity, is a \u201ccreature\u201d, carrying \u201cthe\nstigmatum of [finite] existence\u201d (OE: \u00a78). Second, nausea\nis not simply a physiological event. It shows us dramatically how\nexistence can encircle us on all sides, to the point of submerging us.\nAs Rolland observes, in that case social and political life may also\nnauseate us. Third, if being is experienced in its pure form as\nweighty indeterminacy, then we can neither bypass it (following the\n\u201caspirations of Idealism\u201d [OE: \u00a78]), nor even simply\naccept it as passive subjects. Being is existence, and it is firstly\nour existence. The mark of creaturely existence is need and,\nby extension, a struggle with being. Levinas concludes polemically,\n\n\n\n[e]very civilization that accepts being\u2014with the tragic despair\nit contains and the crimes it justifies\u2014merits the name\n\u201cbarbarian\u201d. (OE: \u00a78) \n\n\nThe question remains: how shall we best think through the sensuous\nneed to transcend being? Embodied need is not an illusion; is\ntranscendence one? Levinas will answer this question fully in\n1961.\n2.2 Middle Writings: Existence and Existents (1947) and Time and the Other (1947) or Inflections of Transcendence and Variations on Being\n\nThe 1940s writings extend Levinas\u2019 innovations in ontology,\nalways with recourse to interpretations of embodiment and against\nHeidegger\u2019s philosophy of existence which, for Levinas, entails\nengagement with being as \u201cparticipation\u201d without\n alterity.[9]\n These writings inflect his notion of transcendence, away from the\nimagined transcendence of evasion and pleasure, toward eros\nand the promise of the birth of a\n child.[10]\n This requires he explore alterity, understood as the feminine other\n(EE: 86).\n\nIn Existence and Existents (1947) and Time and the\nOther (1947), being now has a dual aspect, of light and of dark\nindeterminacy. It is as though being were divided between the being of\na created world and the darkness out of which light was\n brought.[11]\n This shifts phenomenological focus onto being as light and\nvisibility, in which we constitute objects, and being as the dark\nturmoil that we experience in insomnia. Levinas\u2019 attempt to\nexpand the sense of the embodied Da-sein, and reconsider the\ndistinction between being and Da-sein (existence and the\nperceptual open that we are) has also changed. Following\nHusserl\u2019s transcendental phenomenology, in which a multi-layered\n\u201cI\u201d directs intentional focus like a center from which our\nattention radiates, Levinas\u2019 embodied ego is neither preceded\nnor outstripped by its world. The corporeal self [soi],\nhenceforth called the \u201chypostasis\u201d, is its own ground;\ni.e., we awaken out of ourselves, into light; we proceed with our\nprojects (EE: 61\u201386; TO: 51\u201355). We fall asleep, curled\nabout ourselves, thereby exiting our conscious existence. Embodied\nconsciousness thus begins and ends with itself. As such, it is both\ndependent on and independent from its environment, and Levinas will\nurge that the subject, upon awakening, uses and masters being.\n\nIn the middle period essays, the partial transcendences of pleasure\nand desire, already sketched in 1935, receive fuller development and\nvariations. The meaning of transcendence focuses on a new temporality\npromised by desire and \u201cfecundity\u201d, or the birth of the\nson (EE: 100; TO: 91\u201392). The son incarnates alterity in a\ncurious way. He is, in a sense, his father and not his\nfather. However, his birth opens a focus on the future. No longer\nconceived as one of open possibilities, as Heidegger had argued, the\ntime opened by the son responds to two basic limitations on our\nunderstanding and representation: death and the other person. While\nnot denying Heidegger\u2019s intuition about death as the\n\u201cpossibility of impossibility\u201d, Levinas repeats his\nearlier argument that we witness death only in the death of the other.\nBut even as such it escapes everyday understanding. Hence Levinas will\nqualify death as an alterity as radical as that of the other human\nbeing who confronts me. \n\n\nIn death the existing of the existent is alienated. To be sure, the\nother that is announced does not possess this existing as the subject\npossesses it; its hold over my existing is mysterious. It is not\nunknown but unknowable. (TO: 75) \n\n\nOf course, we can and do constitute the other an alter ego.\nYet such constitution by phenomenological analogy never exhausts his\nfundamental difference (TO: 78\u201379). In so arguing, Levinas\nproposes to radicalize Husserl\u2019s \u201cother\u201d, of whom\nthe latter said that he or she is \u201can analogon of\nmyself, [yet also] not an analogon in the habitual\nsense\u201d (hu-CM \u00a744: 92-96).\n\nTwo reversals should be noted, here, relative to 1935. First, against\nHegel\u2019s conception of work as the dialectic of spirit\ntransforming nature, Levinas describes labor phenomenologically as\neffort and\n fatigue,[12]\n again highlighting his distinction between the embodied, working self\nand the cognitive ego. The second reversal concerns moods themselves.\nIn Heidegger, anxiety, joy, and boredom were states of mind, with\nanxiety as the privileged mood by which humans are confronted with\nthemselves, their lack of ground, and with the question of their\nexistence. In his middle period, Levinas will expand the experience of\nbeing to moods now including horror. Nighttime being reveals an\nindeterminate dark presence that is not pure nothing. \u201cThe\nhorror of the night, as an experience of the there-is, does not then\nreveal to us a danger of death, nor even a danger of pain\u201d (EE:\n57). Therefore pure being can never be just Heidegger\u2019s lighted\nclearing. And our existence in the world requires stronger embodiment\nthan an eye and a hand that reaches to grasp objects\n\u201cready-to-hand\u201d (Heidegger). Once again, Levinas recurs to\nbodily states, this time including fatigue, indolence, insomnia, and\nawakening. In the first three, the aforementioned gap between the\nembodied self and the intentional I increases. Upon awakening, the\nembodied ego (soi-moi) reasserts its mastery over things and\neven its own bodily torpor. But for Levinas being in the world is less\na matter of utility and Heidegger\u2019s phenomenon of\n\u201cfalling\u201d into distraction, than one of love of life and\nsheer enjoyment (he-BT:\n 179).[13]\n This, too, is part of Levinas\u2019 critique of Heidegger, for whom\nour concern for the world often coexists with instrumentalist\nrelationships with things. In search of variations on being as a call\nor a revelation, and in privileging the basic subjectivity (or\n\u201chypostasis\u201d) capable of raising itself above being (now\nunderstood as the neutral \u201cthere is\u201d), Levinas is en\nroute to his secular philosophy of alterity and\ntranscendence.\n\nIt bears recalling that, in phenomenology, light plays figurative and\nliteral roles, from Husserl\u2019s daylight as the condition for\noptimal perception (Ideas II \u00a718) to his metaphor for the\nintentional \u201cray\u201d directed like a spotlight upon an\nobject, to Heidegger\u2019s lighted opening that is Da-sein\nitself (he-BT: 171). Levinas in turn underscores the\n\u2018work\u2019 of light as able to suspend, phenomenologically,\nthe traditional distinction between subjective and objective:\n\u201cdue to the light an object, while coming from without, is\nalready ours in the horizon which precedes it\u201d (EE: 41).\nConsequently, intelligibility is well figured by light.\nPhenomenological evidence is guaranteed by lighted\ncircumstances\u2014albeit for someone. Whereas Heidegger\ndefined Da-sein almost operationally (\u201cby its very\nnature, Dasein brings its \u2018there\u2019 along with\nit\u201d [he-BT: 171]), Levinas returns to the Moderns\u2019\nprinciple \u201cevery object presupposes a subject\u201d.\nMoreover, while the being of Da-sein is itself light and\n\u201cdisclosedness\u201d (he-BT: 171), the being of Levinas\u2019\nhypostasis is characterized by its living cycle of drowsing, sleeping,\nwaking, and acting. Thus, if being is equated with illumination, for\nLevinas it must also include the dark anonymity of night (EE: 54). It\nis both gift (Heidegger\u2019s es gibt) and \u201cthere\nis\u201d (Blanchot\u2019s il y a, as taken up by Levinas).\nConsequently, the question that inaugurates fundamental ontology: Why\nis there being instead of simply nothing? is not Levinas\u2019\nprimary concern. Nothingness, understood as pure absence, may be\nthinkable, but it cannot be experienced. Indeterminate, nocturnal\nbeing remains \u2018something\u2019. As the \u201cthere is\u201d,\nbeing fills in all spatial and temporal intervals, whereas\nconsciousness arises out of it thanks to its self-originating\nawakening and focus. This is Levinas\u2019 first\ncomprehensive sketch of being as a totality, in which the\nself-ego dyad appears as the limited transcendence of neutral being.\nOver the course of his analyses, this self-ego will hearken to a call.\nHowever, the call comes not from being but from an alterity that\nLevinas compares with death itself. \u201cJust as with death, I am\nnot concerned with an existent, but with the event of\nalterity\u201d (TO: 87, emph. added). With \u201cthe event of\nalterity\u201d, however, there is the call of the other person,\nnotably female, experienced as desire, need, even\n generosity.[14]\n These works set the stage for later descriptions of world, facticity,\ntime as now-moment, transcendence in immanence, and transcendence\ntoward a future fecundity in the family. They constitute the core of\nLevinas\u2019 first major work, Totality and Infinity: An Essay\non Exteriority. \n2.3 The \u201cTreatise on Hospitality\u201d: Totality and Infinity (1961) or Responsibility, Transcendence, and Justice\n\nTotality and Infinity was written as Levinas\u2019\nDoctorat\n d\u2019\u00c9tat.[15]\n His concept of transcendence provides us a useful point of departure\nin Totality and Infinity, provided we understand his debt to\nHusserl\u2019s phenomenology. Husserl understood transcendence in\nseveral ways, of which one significant dimension was that typical of\nconsciousness extending toward, and encountering, the worldly objects\nat which it aims. After Husserl, Heidegger will define transcendence\nas the essence of our existing in the world; Da-sein is\nalways already in the world among things, according to a worldly\ntranscendence or being out-there. Sartre followed Heidegger in this,\nurging that \u201ctranscendence is a constitutive structure of\nconsciousness\u201d (Sartre 1943 [1992: 23]), and his concept of\nconsciousness is similarly in the world and ingredient in our\nactions.\n\nFor Levinas, these senses of transcendence are acceptable but not\nprimary. Instead, he aligns transcendence with exteriority, in the\nsense of what lies outside myself but eludes my comprehensive\nknowledge: the other person (TI:\n 49).[16]\n The encounter with the other is an encounter with a visible thing, of\ncourse. But this other speaks to me, implores or commands me.\nIn responding, I discover my responsibility to them. This is the\nground of ethics or indeed our concern with ethics as the good of the\nother person.\n\nAs Levinas argues, when ethics goes in search of its existential\nground, before any consideration of utility, virtue, or duty, it\ndiscovers the intersubjective enactment of responsibility, which\nresists being integrated into accounts in which the other is a\nuniversal other to whom it is my duty, for example, to act\nethically or in the hope of increasing the happiness of the\ncollectivity. Utility, virtue, and duty are crucial to ethical\ndebates. Yet Levinas is pointing to their common lived origin\nin the irreducibility of the face-to-face encounter.\n2.3.1 Totality and Infinity\u2019s Contribution to Ethical Theory\n\nMichael Morgan has discussed Levinas\u2019 existential basis of\nethics in relation to the three ethical schools just indicated (2007).\nHe reminds us that Levinas is working at a pre-theoretical and\nembodied level that represents the impetus behind ethical\nsystems forged through reflection, tradition, and critique. In that\nsense, Levinas\u2019 objective is simultaneously phenomenological and\nhermeneutical: he describes the encounter with the other,\nargues that it imposes a limit on object constitution, and\ninterpretively traces ethics back to the birth of\nintersubjective meaning. As opposed to Heidegger\u2019s inaugural\nquestion of being, Levinas\u2019 concern is with the exteriority or\ntranscendence of the other who addresses me. Consistent with\nMorgan\u2019s claim, Diane Perpich has argued that the face-to-face\nin Levinas gives rise to a \u201cnormativity without norms\u201d\n(2008: 126\u2013127). For his part, Steven Crowell observes that the\nnormativity of the face is also epistemic; it is the ground\nfor the objectivity of any perception because, if the other did not\nface me and call my experience into question, I would never encounter\na \u201csense of the normative, of standards against which the\nvalidity of my experiences can be judged\u201d (Crowell 2015: 574).\nIndeed, the first normativity I experience, prior to reflection,\ncorresponds to an affect (TI: 294), which accompanies my experience of\nthe other\u2019s exteriority. At the same time, I respond to that\nother. As Levinas writes, \n\n\n[l]anguage makes possible the objectivity of objects and their\nthematization. Already Husserl argued that the objectivity of thought\nconsists in being valid for everyone. To know objectively is therefore\nto constitute my thought in such a way that it already contain[s] a\nreference to the thought of others. What I communicate therefore is\nalready constituted in function of others. (TI: 210, emph. added)\n\n\nThus, Levinas\u2019 existential phenomenology of the face-to-face is\nrelevant to contemporary ethics above all insofar as ethics is\nconcerned with its own grounds in lived intersubjectivity. We can even\nnote parallels between Levinas and some contemporary ethicists. For\nexample, the neo-Kantian, Onora O\u2019Neill, bases the rationality\nof practical reason on a \u201cminimal but authoritative\ndemand\u201d, which implies that the ethical principles I espouse\nnever be irrational so that another person could not similarly adopt\nthem. Levinas might say that the \u201cauthority\u201d motivating\nsuch demands is experienced like an effect of the other\u2019s\ntranscendence (O\u2019Neill 1996: 51\u201357). Moral intuitionists\nlike David Wiggins and John McDowell have, similarly to Levinas,\nfocused on our sensibility when it comes to grasping moral truths. In\ndiscussing authentic education, McDowell argues that acquiring an\nethical sensibility makes possible our intuitions of what is right and\ngood. It even fosters a flourishing rational will able to discern\nbona fide ethical requirements (McDowell 1998, Wiggins 1987\n[1998]). Both McDowell and Wiggins share with Levinas an effort to\nenrich the perspective on the subject as a purely rational agent,\nalthough Levinas reconstructs the intersubjective, existential origins\nof that agency.\n\nIt goes without saying that the philosophical influences and debates\nof the above-mentioned ethicists are different from Levinas\u2019.\nDespite this difference, however, Morgan (2007) and Jean-Michel\nSalanskis have both underscored the importance\u2014for the\njustification of any ethics\u2014of scrutinizing its\nexistential conditions. Salanskis asserts that Levinas\u2019\narguments tally with what he calls \u201cthe three requirements to\nwhich any philosophical exposition of morality must respond\u201d.\nThese are: \n\n\nduty as irreducible to being, as Hume, Kant, and Wittgenstein\nexperienced and expressed it. [And ethics, secondly,] must\nnevertheless favor the \u2026 designation of an objective\nduty, not relative to a subjective or psychological trace (such\nrelativity being precursive to the dissolution of morality pure and\nsimple). [Thirdly,] duty must be felt; it is not really duty\nunless it is mine. (Salanskis 2006: 63, my trans.) \n\n\nIf ethics refers to the study or to a system of moral principles, then\nLevinas provides a phenomenology of the everyday genesis of these\nprinciples. Salanskis calls this \u201ca new philosophy of\nmorality\u201d (2006: 31\u201373).\n\nIn turn, Gabriela Basterra has recalled that Kant\u2019s moral law,\nunderstood as the basis of a positive feeling and as the object of our\ngreatest respect (Achtung) is cognized a priori, and\neven the respect we experience for it is not of empirical\norigin. Respect is thus a unique affect that motivates my will to\nfollow the moral law, though it is not a feeling in an\nempirical psychological sense (Kant 1788 [2002]). Instead, it is\nsomething that affects me, and Basterra compares it to the affection\nthat Levinas identifies as the interruption of my activity by the\nother who faces me (Basterra 2015). Once again, the two philosophies\nare different, notably because they entail distinct approaches. But it\nremains that, like Kant\u2019s a priori, we cannot\nassimilate the motivation experienced before the face of the other to\na subjective state or to an objective concept.\n2.3.2 Structure of the Work\n\nTotality and Infinity unfolds around phenomenological\ndescriptions of being, depicted initially as nature or forces in\nconflict (TI: 21\u201322). However, our being in-the-world also\nentails the enjoyment of natural elements and love of life (TI:\n110\u2013115). \u201cWe live from \u2018good soup\u2019, air,\nlight, spectacles, work, ideas, sleep, etc.\u2026 These are not\nobjects of representations. We live from them\u201d (TI: 110).\nLevinas also reframes labor as the creation of a store of goods thanks\nto which the other can be welcomed (TI: 157\u2013161, 205), rather\nthan solely as the mastery or humanization of nature. Because we take\njoy in living and in creating a home, our lives are not firstly like\nHeidegger\u2019s \u201ccare\u201d (Sorge; TI: 112).\nInstead, we live nourished and can receive the other into our space.\nOn the basis of these descriptions, transcendence as defined above\ncomes to pass in several stages. First, the onset of the\nother\u2014as the expression of the face\u2014interrupts our free\nactivity (and willing) and calls us to account for ourselves (TI: 198,\n291), something Levinas calls \u201cgoodness\u201d (TI:\n 200).[17]\n Second, in thereby responding, the subject approached by the other\nengages in an act that opens the possibility of dialogue. The\nunfolding of dialogue expands the social relationship, and Levinas\nargues that social life preserves a residuum of the initial\n\u201cethical\u201d encounter with the face. Intersubjective\ndialogue entails conversation, teaching, and at a more general level,\nliterary or philosophical discourse (TI: 51, 57, 251\u201352,\n295).\n\nOver the course of this expansion, the trace of responsibility is\nattenuated and conundrums arise concerning the well-being of\nothers and conflicts within the community. These\nrequire deliberations about justice and fairness. For instance: what\ndoes justice for the other(s) mean? Should it above all concern the\nreparation of wrongs? Can responsibility for an other coexist with\ndisinterested equity? Or is justice ultimately in service to the\nstronger and opposed to responsibility? Now, because it can clearly be\ninterpreted as all these things, justice sometimes appears as\nintermediary between Levinas\u2019 aforementioned ontology of worldly\nforces in conflict (or elementary being) and acts of responsibility.\nThis would tally with Aristotle\u2019s two conceptions of justice,\nfirst as political and second, as unbidden \u2018decency\u2019,\nt\u00f2 epiekes, meaning to accept receiving less than\none\u2019s share. Aristotle himself defined the combination of the\ntwo as complete virtue (Nicomachean Ethics, 1130a,\n119 and\n 1137b7\u201311).[18]\n There would thus be an interesting precedent to Levinas\u2019\nquestion of the relationship between responsibility and justice in\nAristotelian virtue ethics.\n\nLevinas\u2019 argument in Totality and Infinity unfolds up\nto the question of justice and then takes an unanticipated tack.\nRather than pursuing justice as it is refined through civil society\ninto the State, Levinas focuses on a smaller-scale institution, the\nfamily, arguably common to all humanity. It is presumably in the\nfamily rather than in the State that the responsibility described in\nthe face-to-face encounter is most clearly enacted. If the family is\nconsolidated by the birth of the child, then, as Levinas puts it, it\nis the father who elects and calls the child to responsibility, just\nas the child grows up serving his siblings in a way more personal than\nthat prescribed by the impersonal justice of States. According to\nLevinas, this justice carries a specific temporal\nmodalization: \u201cThe unique child, as elected one, is accordingly\nat the same time unique and non-unique. Paternity is produced as an\ninnumerable future\u201d, as open posterity (TI: 279). In this\npenultimate section entitled \u201cBeyond the Face\u201d, the\nphenomenology of the family thus inserts the responsibility\nexperienced in the face-to-face into a micro-society, in which\nquestions of justice may arise, but with a new emphasis on future\ntime.\n2.3.3 Time, Transcendence, and Sociality\n\nTotality and Infinity does not devote attention to clock time\nor to the time of universal (or Hegelian) history. Because Levinas\nbegins his analyses with the concept of being as virtually aligned\nwith material causality and strife, the experience of\n\u2018subjective\u2019 time as the interruption by the face is not\nyet social time. History, too, seems to be a metaphysician\u2019s\nhistory. In his \u201cPreface\u201d, Levinas describes history as\nviolence, punctuated by extremes of war and temporary peace (TI:\n21\u201323). Morgan has argued that this makes Levinas\u2019\napproach to ethical intersubjectivity anti-naturalistic, at least to\nthe degree that naturalism is tied to a Hobbesian mechanistic ontology\nand by extension an ego-centered anthropology (Morgan 2011: 246).\nLevinas would be the last, however, to deny the self-interest of our\ndrives and instincts. To the contrary, only an intersubjectivity\ninaugurated by the other\u2019s summons interrupts these behaviors\n(Morgan 2011: 246). Yet Levinas also envisions an alternative history\nin which it is possible to bear witness to wrongs undergone by\npersons. These wrongs may not be recorded in the official history of\ngovernments, but their attestation prolongs the discussion of human\nsensibility invested by responsibility. Levinas writes, \n\n\nHistory is worked over by the ruptures of history, in which a judgment\nis borne upon it. When man truly approaches the Other he is uprooted\nfrom history. (TI: 52)\n\n\nLevinas\u2019 phenomenological account of time thus contains three\nlevels, an initial one equivalent to formal historicist time; a second\nlevel comparable to Husserl\u2019s universal flow of immanent\n time-consciousness,[19]\n and a third temporality that is episodic and affectively colored,\nwhich he calls an interruption or rupture. \n\n\n[The] discontinuity of the inner life interrupts historical time\n[notably in the face-to-face encounter]. The thesis of the primacy of\nhistory constitutes an option for the comprehension of being in which\ninteriority is sacrificed. The present work proposes another option\n(TI: 57). \n\n\nThe aforementioned interruption of our immanent consciousness qua\ntime-flow by the other, an interruption that Levinas says\ncharacterizes our \u201cinner life\u201d, is aligned with the\nexperience of transcendence.\n\nUnlike Heidegger, who explained the subject in terms of\nDa-sein\u2014itself an ongoing transcendence toward the\nworld in which Da-sein \u201ccomes toward itself\nfuturally\u201d (he-BT:\n \u00a769)[20]\n in facing the possibility of its mortality\u2014Levinas situates his\nvery concrete transcendence in the interruption of the first\ntwo temporal levels. Indeed, whereas Heidegger gradually translated\nhis conception of the silent call of being (to Da-sein) into\nthe notion of the event (Ereignis) in the 1930s, Levinas\nmakes his interruption an intersubjective affair or rather\nthe basis of ethical intersubjectivity. For him, the encounter with\nthe other is not an ontological event in Heidegger\u2019s\nsense. Neither is it like an occurrence that breaks up the historical\nstatus quo, modifying the course of history into a\n\u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019, in function of its\nmagnitude. Nevertheless, Levinas does argue that the encounter with\nalterity may leave a trace in historical\n time.[21]\n Now, because the interruption brings to light a basic personal\nresponsibility for an other, a host of responses are possible post\nfacto, from welcoming that other with hospitality to attempting\nto get him out of our way. Be that as it may, a trace of the\ninterruption persists in the subject, like a grain of sand in an\noyster or a preconscious motivation to bear witness to the\nother\u2019s suffering. Jill Stauffer has recovered some of these\n\u2018traces\u2019 in her research on the testimonies of those\ndeprived of human rights (2015: 40\u201343, 56\u201358, 61\u201364,\n91 inter alia).\n\nFlowing out of the temporal interruptions that leave affective\nmnemonic traces in persons, the ground of social existence in Levinas\ndoes not resemble the solipsism for which Heidegger was sometimes\ncriticized. Our life with others is never a flight from what should be\nthe resolute assumption of our mortality (Heidegger\u2019s\n\u201cinauthenticity\u201d), nor even moments disappearing in a\nteleology of expanding socio-political groups that culminate in the\nState (Hegel, sometimes Husserl). As individuals, we are always\nalready in social relations, marked by a remainder of responsibility.\nWe have always already been impacted by the expression (or face) of an\nother. Yet, because the immediacy of this impact resists\nconceptualization, we tend to overlook the force the other\u2019s\naddress has on us (as facial expression or words). We carry on, in our\nrespective spheres, apparently motivated by desires and projects, some\nof which entail the kind of quests for mastery and recognition that\nHegel described. Nevertheless, in Totality and Infinity,\nthese quests are as if undercut by \u201cmetaphysical desire\u201d\n(TI: 33\u201334, 114, 148ff.), which Levinas defines as \u201ca\ndesire [for the other] that cannot be satisfied\u201d. As he\nexplains, \u201cwe speak lightly of desires satisfied, or of sexual\nneeds, or even of moral and religious needs\u201d (TI: 34). However,\nmetaphysical desire \u201cdesires beyond everything that can simply\ncomplete it. It is like goodness\u2014the Desired does not fulfill\nit, but deepens it\u201d (TI: 34). This under-layer of our everyday\ndesires comes to light in the faltering of our will to mastery as\nexperienced in the face-to-face encounter. The other\u2019s facial\nexpression or bodily posture affects me before I begin to reflect on\nit. As indicated, it is dual: a command and a summons. Naked and\ndefenseless, the face signifies, with or without words, \u201cDo not\nkill me\u201d. It opposes a passive resistance to our desire for\nmastery wherein our freedom asserts its sovereignty (TI: 84). Levinas\nspeaks of the face of the other who is \u201cwidow, orphan, or\nstranger\u201d. While these are biblical figures, he argues that we\nencounter them concretely even before transcribing them into religious\nallegory (TI: 76\u201378). Indeed they invest our freedom as the\npossibility of giving.\n\nIt is as summons and injunction that expression precipitates\ntranscendence. If I am self-sufficient in my everyday activities and\nperception, then this is because I am a being that inhabits\noverlapping worlds in which my sway is largely decisive for me. The\npassive resistance of the face alters this sway through an affective\nmood not unlike one Levinas had explored in 1935: shame. In shame, we\nexperience our freedom as unjustifiable. In thus being as if lifted\nout of its concerns, the \u201cI\u201d offers an account to the\nother, who is thereby treated as if higher than that \u201cI\u201d\nwhen considered in its personal sovereignty. For that reason as well,\nthe \u201cI\u201d, singled out and addressed by the other, is chosen\nor as if \u201celected\u201d to respond (TI: 245\u2013246, 279). It\n\u201ctransascends\u201d (35, 41) or rises to the other, answering\n\u201chere I am\u201d (EI: 106). Levinas argues that this instant of\n\u201celection\u201d belongs to a temporal order different from that\nof everyday existence: the moment of enactment of a \u201cgood beyond\nBeing\u201d (TI: 80, 102\u2013104, 292\u2013293).\n\nIt is impossible to set up a temporal order of succession or\nalternation between being and the good beyond being. For humans, the\ngood comes to pass almost trivially and in everyday contexts. Of\ncourse, as readily as responsibility and generosity may be glimpsed in\nhuman affairs, cruelty and competition are also obvious. Given this,\nLevinas seeks support for his intuition about the good in at least two\nmoments in the philosophical tradition wherein its occurrence and\nirreducible value have been identified: Plato\u2019s Idea of the\ngood, and Descartes\u2019 infinite substance, which points beyond\nitself to an unknowable cause. However, that humans\nexperience moments of inexplicable generosity, even enact them\nspontaneously, is a fact that would remain enigmatic within an\nontology of competing drives or merely utilitarian desires. In that\nrespect, the trace of the good is present within existence as the\npossibility that something other than rivalries and\ninstrumentalization take place intersubjectively.\n\nAs Levinas understands it, transcendence has the non-metaphysical\ncharacteristic of an interruption, a relation in nuce, and\nwhat he now calls \u201cinfinity\u201d. Insofar as infinity denotes\nwhat is non-limited, uncircumscribable, it refers to the unpredictable\nquality of a face\u2019s expression (TI: 5). As he writes, \n\n\n[t]o think the infinite, the transcendent, the Stranger, is hence not\nto think an object. But to think what does not have the lineaments of\nan object is in reality to do more or better than think. (TI: 49) \n\n\nSo far as infinity has a positive sense, then, it has that sense as\nour unquenchable desire for sociality. Thus, before we interpret it as\n\u201cGod\u201d or reify it as a summum ens, the idea of\ninfinity is rooted in an everyday encounter whose implications are\nclearest at the sensuous-affective level, and even somewhat resemble\nHusserl\u2019s explorations of spontaneous empathy\n(Einf\u00fchlung as radicalized in the 1930s notes on\nintersubjectivity [Husserliana, vols. 13\u201315 (Husserl\n1973a,b,c)]). Rather than Husserl, however, Levinas refers to the\nFrench phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty\u2019s conception of\nlived intersubjective flesh, urging that this corporeal intertwinement\nis part of our \u201cfundamental\n historicity\u201d,[22]\n that is, part of the sedimented experiences that contribute to our\ngrasp of new situations. Rich with the accumulation of past\nexperiences, intersubjective sensibility proves to be the locus of\nrelationality and transcendence in 1961.\n\nIn the fourteen years separating Existence and Existents and\nTime and the Other from Totality and Infinity, we\nsee both continuities and differences. If Heidegger had begun what he\nconceived to be a hermeneutic deformalization of Husserl\u2019s\nphenomenological consciousness, seeking what \u201clies hidden\u201d\nbeneath phenomena (he-BT: \u00a77c), then Levinas extended this\ndeformalizing gesture already in 1947, arguing that light itself is\nincipient meaning, suspending the opposition between the a\npriori and the a posteriori. By 1961, it is the\nexperience of the face-to-face encounter that destabilizes the a\npriori-a posteriori dichotomy by urging that, in the\nface-to-face, the third party (humanity) looks at me through\nthe eyes of the other. This is because the non-spatial\n\u201cproximity\u201d that is the interruption of our flowing\ntime-consciousness takes place with an unnoticed spontaneity like that\nof the blinking of an eye, yet nevertheless leaves a trace.\nConsciousness always takes up after these instants of interruption and\nreconnects itself as a homogeneous flow. Thus the good beyond being is\nnot radically separated from existence in 1961. Consequently and to\nrepeat, this affair is a human one. Any philosophical translation of\nconcrete embodied life must therefore approach the human subject as it\nemerges through its relations with others, even though the\nintersubjective situation entails both my particularization through\nelection and a loss of egoic mastery. This is in line with many of\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s analyses, some of them inspired by Husserl,\nalthough Merleau-Ponty argues against transcendental subjectivity,\nurging that the classic phenomenological \u201cI\u201d constituting\nits world alone will drift toward an unwanted absoluteness. It could\nthus never be alone and must be approached existentially (mp-PP:\n365).\n2.3.4 Being, Mediations (the Family and the State), and the Will in Ethics and Politics\n\nWhereas in Existence and Existents, Levinas voiced \u201cthe\nprofound need to leave the climate of [Heidegger\u2019s]\nphilosophy\u201d (EE: 4), by 1961 he will have done so, albeit not\nwithout significantly reworking Heidegger\u2019s fundamental\nontology. As we have seen, Levinas envisages being as constant,\nneutral presence and, at times, like a Hobbesian state of nature.\nDerrida reminds us that this pre-Heideggerian conception is close to\nKant\u2019s notion of existence understood as conflictual intensities\n(1997 [1999: 49, 86]). That is why, in its natural expression, being\ntakes on almost a mechanistic quality in Levinas. In social and\ninstitutional senses, being is conceived as the encompassing of\nindividuals and communities by the State. On the latter depend\nsecurity and property, life and death. But in the\n\u201cPreface\u201d to Totality and Infinity, Levinas\ncompares the State with systematic philosophy: as the\n\u2018organon\u2019 of politics, the State manages commerce\nand conflicts, just as it declares wars. Similarly, Hegel\u2019s\nidealist dialectics oversees and integrates sensibility and cognition,\npassing from the individual to the collective, and expressing the\nmovement of Geist or Spirit, itself (TI: 21\u201323;\n36\u201338; 87\u201388).\n\nOverall, Levinas\u2019 most sustained criticisms target fundamental\nontology. As we have seen, leaving the \u201catmosphere\u201d of\nHeidegger\u2019s thought motivates his return to more traditional\nconceptions of being. To be sure, Levinas was skeptical about deriving\nan ethics from ontology. Certainly, such an ethics could not limit\nitself to Heidegger\u2019s Mitsein, that sociality into\nwhich Da-sein flees when troubled by its uncanny\ngroundlessness (its being thrown into-the-world). Having attempted,\nfrom 1935 onward, to deformalize Heidegger\u2019s being-there and its\nstates of mind or moods (Befindlichkeiten), that is, down to\nmore embodied experiences of shame, desire, hunger, and\nnausea, Levinas\u2019 conviction is that Da-sein remains too\nformal an entity to exist in a world in which intersubjectivity is\nmore substantial than a mere refuge from the anxious care of\ngroundlessness (he-BT: 232). Indeed, although for Heidegger anxiety\nindividuates us and discloses our possibility for \u201cthe freedom\nof choosing \u2026 and taking hold of [ourselves]\u201d (he-BT: 232),\nthis process remains solipsistic in the sense that it is our freedom\nand our mortality that are in question. When intensified,\nAngst reveals the groundlessness of our being-there,\nultimately freeing us for the most radical question: why might there\n\u2018be\u2019 anything at all? Against Heidegger, Levinas\nunderstands this framing as tantamount to a hermeneutic universe in\nwhich the idea of our authentic possibility concerns only death and\nunderestimates the significance of the encounter with the other\nperson. Only through a different hermeneutics, which reveals human\nexistence as embodied and interpersonal, can we conceptualize\nthe opening to responsibility that the encounter with the other\ncreates.\n\nIn this respect, and despite his debt to Heidegger, Levinas stands\ncloser here to the French existentialists and to Charles Taylor, whose\nconception of the corporeal self is moral \u201cthrough and\nthrough\u201d (Morgan 2007: 169). However, unlike Taylor, Levinas\ndoes not endorse a plurality of strong values, because the\nencounter with the other is the primary condition for him. While\nTaylor\u2019s philosophy is influenced by Christianity, a significant\ndebate has been ongoing for over a decade about Levinas\u2019\nphilosophy and its relationship to Judaism. It has been suggested that\nLevinas\u2019 critique of Heidegger\u2019s ontology as a\n\u201cphilosophy of the Neuter\u201d (TI: 298) relies on decisive\nattention paid to the influence of \u201cJerusalem\u201d over that\nof \u201cAthens\u201d in the Western philosophical tradition.\nScholars like Shmuel Trigano have traced a number of crucial\nLevinasian \u201cphilosophemes\u201d to Jewish positions, notably as\nexpressed by Philo and Maimonides (Trigano 2002: 145\u2013178). On\nthe other hand, commentators like Leora Batnitzky have argued that,\nwhen compared with the thought of Leo Strauss, for whom Jewish\nphilosophy still holds a place for \u201crevelation\u201d,\nLevinas\u2019 work largely rehabilitates the tradition of Modern\nphilosophy\u2014and with it a secular, almost political, project\n(Batnitzky 2006: 4). Despite this, and in light of Totality and\nInfinity, she comes close to Trigano when she argues that Levinas\ntends to ignore important political questions, including that of the\nJewish State, which has dire consequences for his thought, because\n\n\n\nto think politics is urgent in an undertaking [such as\nLevinas\u2019], since it amounts to thinking through the criterion of\nethical validity of the universalization project \u2026 with regard to\nthe other and with regard to self \u2026. (Batnitzky 2006:\n173\u2013174)\n\n\nLevinas\u2019 recourse to Descartes\u2019 Meditations may\nwell justify Batnitzky\u2019s qualifying his thought as Modern. More\nimportant is that his argument that ethics is first philosophy (TI:\n29, 47, 304) runs into the difficulty of universalizing our\npre-intentional \u201cexperience\u201d of spontaneous responsibility\ntoward the other. Hence, in Totality and Infinity, the\ntransition from the micro-sociality of the face-to-face encounter to\nsocial existence more broadly occurs through language as teaching and\ndialogue (TI: 194\u2013197; 201\u2013203). As indicated, Levinas\nwill open still another path to universalization, through the family,\nin his final section \u201cBeyond the face\u201d (TI:\n267\u2013280). Despite this second path, the question remains how it\nis that, through the eyes of the other, the whole of humanity looks at\nme (TI: 213). Gillian Rose first criticized this limited\nuniversalization of responsibility as lacking important\nsocio-political mediations (1992). Ernst Wolff has investigated this\npassage toward universality in light of Levinas\u2019 evolving\nconception of liberal society, from a skeptical stance toward a more\npositive appraisal (2007).\n\nBy focusing on temporal mediations (rather than social or spatial\nones), Levinas does provide a partial universalization of\nresponsibility by way of the aforementioned phenomenon of the family.\nThis choice, resembling the solidarity through love found in\nHegel\u2019s early theological writings, works responsibility out in\nterms one might today consider traditional or patriarchal, i.e.,\nthrough paternal election and the service of the son to his brothers.\nIntroducing this discussion, Levinas admits: \n\n\nThe acuity of the problem [of universalization] lies in the necessity\nof maintaining the I in the transcendence [of the face-to-face] with\nwhich it hitherto seemed incompatible [given its self-interests]. (TI:\n276) \n\n\nThat is, although the face-to-face is a momentary interruption, the\ntrace of responsibility needs to be received and assured in a more\ndurable way, which leads Levinas to assert that \u201cthe fecundity\nof the I is its very [temporal] transcendence\u201d (TI: 277). That\nis, thanks to the time of generations, an ego surpasses\nitself through its children (TI: 277). Thus, while this\nunder-determined time of generations \u201cadds something new to\nbeing, something absolutely new\u201d (TI: 283), the child, it\nprovides a partial mediation between the affective instant of\nresponsibility and the creation of institutions and practices apt to\nensure that the ethical trace has a potential for universality.\n\nBoth Rose (1992) and Derrida have pointed toward the difficulty of\nintroducing ethics into questions of justice and politics in this way\n(Derrida 1964 [1978: 121, 133\u2013136]). Part of the difficulty here\nlies in the tension between universalization understood as the ethical\ncultivation of humanity, versus universalization understood as\nproviding an ethical inflection to politics broadly conceived. For\nLevinas, the passage of responsibility into politics is invariably\nfragile, because ethical language is frequently absorbed or imitated\nby political rhetoric. Yet, in 1961, the question of how\nresponsibility and election experienced in the family\npasses\u2014without tribalism\u2014into a vaster history and public\nspace remains under-thematized; notably, as it concerns demands for\nsocial justice and equality. Levinas partly responds, urging\nthat the notion of fraternity is not firstly biological or\ngenetic, but intersubjective; it flows out of face-to-face\nencounters\u2014and what he calls the human kinship forged by\n\u201cmonotheism\u201d (TI: 214), by which he means the ethical core\nor essence of Judaism. He argues, \n\n\nThe very status of the human implies fraternity and the idea of the\nhuman race. Fraternity is radically opposed to the conception of a\nhumanity united by resemblance, a multiplicity of diverse families\narisen from the stones cast behind by Deucalion, and which, across the\nstruggle of egoisms, results in a human city. (TI: 214) \n\n\nThis unification in difference is created only when monotheism results\nin a law that equalizes those obliged by it. Indeed, as we have seen,\nLevinas similarly traces what he calls originary\n\u201creligion\u201d to the face-to-face, following his\nphenomenological genealogy (TI: 40). Commentators have nevertheless\ninsisted that, unless ethics can correct or amend justice on the basis\nof a subject\u2019s experience of responsibility, the possibility of\nuniversalization stands open to doubt (Wolff 2007: 383\u2013399). And\nfor many commentators, interpersonal responsibility remains the\nexception not the rule. It may be subject to codification, though that\nwould be the concern of ethical theory, which is not Levinas\u2019\npriority (see Morgan 2007: 238).\n\nTwo dilemmas thus arise in Totality and Infinity. It is an\nopen question whether they are laid to rest in Otherwise than\nBeing. They concern first the dichotomy between what was\ntraditionally called free will versus nature, and second the\nsocio-cultural mediations between families and States. In the first\ncase, it may be surprising that Levinas characterizes human existence\nin terms resembling those of physiological determinism, that is, in\nterms of drives and the interests attaching to them. For him, the\nproblem of reconciling freedom and nature would above all be one of\ninterrupting the activity of the drives, which is the bodily substrate\nof consciousness and contributes to its dynamic temporal unity.\nUnderstanding the will, then, does not begin with freedom so much as\nwith something closer to conatus essendi or even to a will to\npower (i.e., with something \u201cnatural\u201d). Levinas proves\nclose to Kant here. For the latter, the motivation to\ndisregard one\u2019s interests in favor of the moral law\nlies in the unique affect called Achtung. Kant urged that\nAchtung be considered in its negative and positive aspects:\nnegatively, as attention or freedom from sensuous\ndistraction. In its positive sense, Achtung corresponds to\nreverentia, respect, understood as the freedom to grasp the\nlaw as something eminently worthy of adherence, despite its\nconstraining quality. Moreover, \n\n\nthe presentation of something as determining basis of our\nwill humbles us in our self-consciousness when we compare it with\nthe sensible propensity of our nature. (Kant 1788 [2002: 45]; Nancy\n1983 [2004: 142]; Basterra 2015: 91\u201398) \n\n\nAs the focus of attention and motivation, Achtung is unique\nin that it is what Kant calls an intellectual affect (Kant\n1788 [2002: 66]). It has no direct relationship to our bodily make up,\nwhich, as we know from Levinas, is indissociably tied up with drives\nand instincts. When thus motivated, practical reason determines itself\nto act out of respect for a law indemonstrable by theoretical reason,\nthereby discovering freedom in the performance of its moral act. It is\nonly then, post facto, that freedom is found to have reality,\nthrough obedience.\n\nBasterra has argued that Kant\u2019s ethics affords us an important\ninsight into the question of nature versus freedom in Levinas. Whereas\nfor both, the will follows its natural course (desires and emotions),\nsomething outside it may compel it toward ethical behavior or\nresponsibility. For Kant, the categorical imperative does not\n\u201cbelong\u201d to the self-positing subject, but rather\naddresses them as if from without and elicits humility. For\nLevinas, it is the face of the other that addresses us thus and\nfocuses our attention, prior to our considering that face\u2019s\nempirical qualities (sex, ethnicity, etc.; Basterra 2015:\n125\u2013126).\n\nLet us now turn toward the second dilemma: the fraught relationship\nbetween ethics and politics. In 1961, Levinas characterizes politics\nand drives as unfolding in a parallel fashion. Both are sites for the\nmanifestation of the will to persist in being. He doubts that politics\n\u201cleft to itself\u201d can become or long remain ethical (TI:\n300; Wolff 2007: 129). However, he remarks that justice can be\naddressed as a demand posed to some States, notably liberal\nones.\n\nThis does not solve the problem of mediations, yet suggests that it\nmay be misguided. After all, what do the mediations ultimately serve,\nif not the finality of the State as overarching protector and\n regulator?[23]\n Levinas was aware of this. In 1951, in his first published article on\nthe State of Israel, he did not hesitate to forestall accusations of\nidolatry even against a Jewish State. Arguing philosophically\nthat the \u201cState is not an idol because it precisely permits full\nself-consciousness\u201d, he added that modern humans\n\u201cacknowledge [their] spiritual nature \u2026 when acting in the\nservice of the State and in their dignity as\n citizens\u201d.[24]\n This is indeed why, he added, the decline of organized religions is\ntied to the advent of modern States. Here and elsewhere, he recognized\nthat a State, and preeminently one founded on a religion, embodied a\nparadox whose solution\u2014in Israel\u2019s case at\nleast\u2014could only be found in an approach to religion as the\nsymbolic pendant of ethical responsibility (DF: 218). He\nthereupon added the more existential claim that \n\n\nthe Jewish people craved their own land and their own State, not\nbecause of the abstract independence which they desired, but because\nthey could then finally begin the work of their lives. (DF: 218) \n\n\nClearly, this is not an exhaustive solution to the problem of\nmediations between family (or ethnicity) and the State (or\npolitics).\n\nCommentators have taken various positions on Levinas\u2019 politics.\nHoward Caygill\u2019s Levinas and the Political was the\nfirst systematic, critical study thereof. Caygill emphasized\ninconsistencies in Levinas\u2019 texts on politics and Israel, and\npointed to his \u201cproblematic fusion of rabbinics and\nHegelianism\u201d (2002: 79\u201393). Morgan and Salanskis have\nrecently argued that politics can stand within both history\nand a certain idealism, at least insofar as one understanding of\n\u201cIsrael\u201d acknowledges Jewish particularity as carrying the\npossibility of universalization, thanks to the Biblical\nprophets\u2019 call for justice (Morgan 2016: 250ff; Salanskis 2006;\nsee also Salanskis 2016). It bears noting that by 1984 Levinas will be\nmore generous toward European liberal States, and more willing to\ntrace the genealogy of liberalism back to a Biblical conception of\nresponsibility. In \u201cPeace and Proximity\u201d (1984), he\nventured, \n\n\nEurope is not a simple confluence of two cultural currents. It is the\nconcreteness where theoretical and biblical wisdom do better than\nconverge. The relation with the other \u2026 that is, with peace[,]\ncomes a reason that thematizes, synchronizes, and synthesizes, that\nthinks a world and reflects on being, concepts necessary for the peace\nof humanity. (col-BPW: 168)\n\n2.4 Otherwise than Being, or Beyond Essence (1974): Transcendence-in-Immanence\n\nOtherwise than Being grew up around its core fourth chapter,\nentitled \u201cSubstitution\u201d and first published in 1968 (OBBE:\n 99\u2013129).[25]\n It is a justifiable simplification to say that Levinas\u2019 concept\nof substitution corresponds to that of responsibility, explored this\ntime as immanent relationality rather than \u201cmy\u201d\nresponse to the face, understood as exteriority. In this\nwork, Levinas uses the term\n\u201cint\u00e9riorit\u00e9\u201d repeatedly, which the\ntranslator renders as \u201cinwardness\u201d, perhaps to avoid\nintroducing spatial binaries (OBBE: 28, 87, 92, 108, 119). The work is\nnot about inner-outer dichotomies, much less cognitive operations, or\nobject-memories of events or things. It has little to do with what we\ndiscover phenomenologically through reflection.\n\u201cInwardness\u201d denotes a bodily life as if haunted by\nothers, which is also now called \u201cproximity\u201d (OBBE:\n81\u201394). Comparable in this to Husserl\u2019s horizon of\napperceptions, inwardness entails a spectrum of affective tones.\nPerhaps unlike Husserl, these tones require recourse to discursive\nfigures that Levinas now borrows from psychology, poetics,\nhermeneutics, even theology and dogmatics (e.g.,\n\u201cobsession\u201d, \u201cpersecution\u201d,\n\u201crecurrence\u201d, \u201ctoo tight in its skin\u201d,\n\u201cexile\u201d, \u201cmaternity\u201d, \u201clove\u201d, and\nfinally \u201cexpiation\u201d and\n \u201ckenosis\u201d).[26]\n While thus concerned with intersubjective affectivity in its\nimmediate passive undergoing, substitution is manifest in action or\npraxis, a domain in which we experience\n immediacy.[27]\n By 1974, then, transcendence, understood as the other\n\u201coutside\u201d, has become transcendence-in-immanence, in a\nsense closer to Merleau-Ponty\u2019s account of intercorporeity,\nwhich similarly urged that philosophies of embodiment should never\noppose immanence and transcendence (mp-PP: 308). For Levinas,\nthe concept of the other would still have some reference to the face\nas expression and exteriority, but it would denote\nprincipally the \u201cinwardness\u201d of non-object forming\nmemories, whose affective return or \u201crecurrence\u201d\ncomplexifies the linear time-structure of Husserl\u2019s\nphenomenological consciousness (OBBE: 88).\n2.4.1 The Structure of the Work\n\nOtherwise than Being opens with a general overview of the\nargument, in which being and transcendence are also named\n\u201cessence\u201d and \u201cdisinterest\u201d. Emphasizing the\nprocessual quality of being, Levinas will refer to it equivalently as\n\u201cbeing\u201d or \u201cessence\u201d, venturing that\nhe might even have used the dynamic form essance (OBBE: 187\nnote 1). Responsibility will be focused and discussed as the condition\nof possibility of all verbal signification (OBBE: 43\u201347). But\nthe themes of conversation and teaching recede into the background. He\nnow makes a more strategic use of the body as flesh, that is, as a\nlocus with simultaneously an inside and an outside, as in\nMerleau-Ponty. Subjectivity is again framed affectively as the coming\nto pass of responsibility, although this time the phenomenological\nanalysis of intentionality is analyzed into its primitive layer of\nsensibility that Levinas calls \u201cpre-originary susceptiveness\n[susception pr\u00e9-originaire]\u201d (OBBE: 122,\n136\u2013138). For him, that means that subjectivity always entails\npre-cognitive dimensions that are from the outset intersubjectively\nconditioned. The other has become other-in-the-same, as indicated. But\nthe other-in-the-same is not objectively different from the\nfactical other who faces me, because neither are objects and both are\nexpressions or modes of alterity. As we will see, the\nother-in-the-same describes a pre-thematic \u201cinvestiture\u201d\n(because I never know when I first experienced this other in\nme; OBBE: 125): \u201cAll my inwardness is invested in the form of a\ndespite-me, for-another\u201d (OBBE: 11). In Otherwise than\nBeing, Levinas has returned to Husserl\u2019s inquiries into\npassive synthesis, to the latter\u2019s perplexities about the\nstretch of retentions of passive experiences, about the unbidden\nspontaneity of our associations, and the near-infinity of sensuous\nhorizons\u2014all part of a process unfolding in what Husserl called\nin 1926 \u201ca phenomenology of the so-called unconscious\u201d\n(Husserl 2001: 201 and \u201cAppendix 19\u201d 512\u2013519). In\nlight of this return, we should not approach interiority and\nexteriority as opposed terms, but as dimensions of intersubjectivity\nand the inhabitation of a self by alterity.\n\nThe second chapter approaches Heidegger\u2019s discussion of language\nas the way in which being becomes, the way it temporalizes (he-BT:\n \u00a768).[28]\n Levinas revisits Heidegger\u2019s argument that the logos\ngathers up being and makes possible its unveiling\n(al\u0113theia). He will argue that the lapse of time\nbetween lived immediacy and its reflective representation is\nnever fully gathered by the logos. Therefore, the\ntemporal lapse poses a challenge to language understood as\nHeidegger\u2019s gathering and it falls, much the way that\ntranscendence as interruption did in 1961, outside the realm of being,\neven though Levinas still considers being a process of totalization,\nsomething all-encompassing. This rethinking of the lapse along with\ntranscendence-in-immanence will be Levinas\u2019 ultimate\nmodification of Heidegger\u2019s project. Together, the lapse and\nthis new conception of transcendence do ultimately pass through\nlanguage as words addressed. I will come back to this. For now,\nsuffice it to say that it is the inhabitation of a self by alterity\nthat forms the sensuous conditions of possibility of speech. Thus it\nis not being that addresses us through language, it is a quite\ndifferent alterity.\n\nTwo additional innovations in Otherwise than Being include:\n(1) the proposed phenomenological reduction to the birth of meaning in\na bodily self that carries what it cannot identify as\nproperly itself (the \u201cother\u201d, affectively). This appears\nto be a radicalization of Husserl\u2019s discussion of the\npre-reflective ego in Ideas II (\u00a758, \u201cSupplement\n12\u201d \u00a7\u00a72\u20133). Whereas Husserl emphasized the basis\nof the ego in its ongoing flow of lived experience, which he said was\n\u201clawful\u201d, Levinas focuses on the discontinuity of time\nconsciousness (see also Franck 1981 [2014: 149\u2013166]). (2) A\nhermeneutics of the self, emerging through intersubjective contact in\nwhich the \u201cproximity\u201d of the other elicits passive\n\u201csubstitution\u201d and opens onto spontaneous communication\n(OBBE: 113\u2013121). In what suggests an attempt at deepening\nHusserl\u2019s concept of empathy (Einf\u00fchlung; OBBE:\n125), the figures of proximity, recurrence, and substitution\ncharacterize the intersubjective intertwining that makes communication\npossible: \u201cCommunication would be impossible if it should have\nto begin in the ego, a free subject, to whom every other would be only\na limitation that invites war\u201d (OBBE: 119). Indeed, prior to\nspoken or written language, prior to signs reciprocally exchanged,\n\u201cwe suppose that there is in the transcendence involved in\nlanguage a relationship that is not empirical speech, but\nresponsibility\u201d (OBBE: 120). As \u201cmy pre-originary\nsusceptiveness\u201d, the nature of intersubjective\nsensibility shares its time-structure with strong passions, sometimes\nindeed with trauma (OBBE: 122\u2013124). As Levinas writes: \n\n\n[this susceptiveness] describes the suffering and vulnerability of the\nsensible as the other in me \u2026. the ipseity [also known\nas embodied selfhood] has become at odds with itself in its return to\nitself. The self-accusation of remorse gnaws away at the closed and\nfirm core of consciousness \u2026 fissioning it \n\n\nin its temporal unity (OBBE: 124\u2013125). Consequently,\nvulnerability and sensitivity to trauma not only provoke retreat into\nself but heighten our awareness, however tenuous, of our connection\nwith the other(s), and they motivate our bearing witness. Thus the\naffective in-habitation of my self by others precedes speech-acts and\nspeech-communities. If the reverse were the case; that is, if a de\nfacto community were posited as prior to the event of words\naddressed, then this would presuppose what it was meant to show: the\ngenesis of speech-acts (OBBE: 92). Instead, \u2018beneath\u2019\nwords proffered lies a fundamental vulnerability that psychology might\ninterpret as a predisposition to witnessing, from oneself to the\nother. Levinas calls this vulnerability the \u201cSaying\u201d\n(OBBE: 149\u2013152). It is both precursive to words uttered in the\nform of address (i.e., pre-linguistic), and it would accompany\ncommunication like its affective horizon. The duality of Saying and\nSaid is a new concept in Levinas\u2019 late work.\n\nBuilding on the exploration of proximity begun in chapter three,\nchapters four and five evince a tone more somber than any found\nhitherto in Levinas\u2019 \u0153uvre. This is in keeping\nwith the dedication of the book, written in Hebrew and in French,\nwhich announces that it will be a work of mourning. While Derrida\ncharacterized Totality and Infinity as a phenomenology of\nhospitality (Derrida 1997 [1999: 21]), Otherwise than Being\ncommemorates the \u201cvictims of the \u2026 hatred of the other\nman\u201d. It develops the parallel between semiotic\n\u201csubstitution\u201d of a word for a thing (or the signifying\nfunction of all language) and the spontaneous substitution of myself\nfor an other (implied by a spectrum of acts of self-sacrifice), which\nLevinas calls the one-for-the-other (OBBE: 45\u201350, 70\u201374,\n119\u2013129). Whereas Heidegger had explored the hermeneutics of\nDa-sein, for whom communication unfolds thanks to our (as\nDa-sein) taking or equivalently offering \u201cthis [thing\nor word] as that [thing]\u201d (he-BT: \u00a731), Levinas will\narguably set Heidegger\u2019s \u201cas\u201d into his\n \u201cfor\u201d:[29]\n Heidegger\u2019s \u201cthis as that\u201d becomes\nLevinas\u2019 \u201cone for the other\u201d of\nsubstitution. While responsibility expressed the unfolding of the\nintersubjective affects that Levinas compared to Plato\u2019s\n\u201cGood beyond Being\u201d in 1961 (TI: 292\u2013293,\n304\u2013307), the good of substitution is more ambiguous, occurring\n\u201con the brink of tears and laughter\u201d (OBBE: 18), yet also\n\u201cglorious\u201d (OBBE: 94, 140\u2013144).\n\nThe experience of time characteristic of trauma, and mourning, does\nnot take the place of Husserlian phenomenology\u2019s\nflowing-yet-always-also-present (str\u00f6mend-stehend)\n time-consciousness,[30]\n any more than it replaces the succession and uninterruptedness of\nclock time. If what-is results from the self-giving of things to the\nfocus of phenomenological attention, and if together they invariably\nfind a place in the formal flow of time-consciousness, then even for\nHusserl what-is, i.e. being, must temporalize. Husserl had always\nurged that, insofar as there is appearing, there is being as well\n(hu-CM: \u00a746; also see Heidegger, he-BT: \u00a77). For Heidegger,\nbeing temporalized through Da-sein, which was\nout-ahead-of-itself or oriented toward its future. Yet if, in both\ntheir cases, being unfolds temporally, then for Levinas, our\nsensibility shows a different temporal character, because the\nsensibility called the other-in-the-same returns and repeats rather\nthan flows. Like trauma and mourning, responsibility in its new somber\ntones recurs without definitively halting the flow of\ntime-consciousness. This is why Levinas referred to the cluster of\nconcepts around substitution as adverbial: they pass through\nbeing (understood as verbal or processual) and its time, and they\nmodify it. Indeed, when being is understood as the verbal dynamism\nexpressed by \u201cessence\u201d, then responsibility and\nsubstitution can only be compared to ad-verbs. Hence the title,\nautrement, other-wise or \u2018otherly\u2019 than being\n(OBBE: 35).\n\nThe final half of chapter five recurs to the performative register of\nlanguage to convey the tension of a consciousness striving to\nconsolidate itself in the wake of alterity as affective investiture,\nby which its passivity slowly becomes active witnessing. This opening\nout of inward affects becoming gestures of generosity motivates\nOtherwise than Being\u2019s recourse to a new, performative\nlanguage. Thus, Levinas adds, \n\n\nand I still interrupt the ultimate discourse in which all the\ndiscourses are stated, in saying it to one that listens \u2026 That is\ntrue of the discussion I am elaborating at this very moment. (OBBE:\n 170)[31]\n\n\n\nAware of the seemingly artificial quality of calling his authorial\nwitness \u201cimmediate\u201d, Levinas\u2019 claim is nevertheless\nmore than a literary artifice. Basterra compares it to Kant\u2019s\nidea of autonomy, which shows itself only when we follow a law that\n\u201cexceeds and addresses the subject\u201d, motivating our\nethical act (Basterra 2015: 126). Earlier in her study, she\nhad argued that the intellectual affect of Achtung was\ncapable of focusing our attention and opening us to a respect\ncomparable to Levinas\u2019 Saying, which he also calls\n\u201csincerity\u201d. For pure reason, autonomy \u201cis therefore\nan illusion\u201d, but it is one only insofar as that which is not\nintrinsically part of my interests can still motivate me to\nact. Thus pure reason erroneously supposes that my ethical gesture\ncame from me (Basterra 2015: 129). Levinas provides us a\ncrucial hermeneutics of the intersubjective origin of this Kantian\n\u201cillusion\u201d. He sets our misinterpretation of heteronomy as\nautonomy in Kant\u2019s practical reason into a hermeneutic register,\nreferring to the sincerity and substitution underlying the words we\noffer: \u201cIt is in the risky uncovering of oneself, in sincerity,\nthe breaking up of inwardness \u2026 exposure to traumas,\nvulnerability\u201d that I bear witness to, and for another (OBBE:\n48). Again, it does not come from us. Levinas finds illustrations of\nsuch witnessing in many places, from the justice imperative of the\nprophets to the concern of Latin American clerics over the events\nunfolding in Chile in 1973 (OGCM 81\u201382).\n2.4.2 New Existential Moods and Fleshly Memories\n\nAs in his 1935 discussion of need and nausea, Otherwise than\nBeing argues that lived sensibility often overflows\nrepresentation. And again, Levinas suggests sensuous modes different\nfrom Heidegger\u2019s Befindlichkeiten (see\n \u00a72.2 above),\n in which all understanding takes place for Heidegger (he-BT: 17).\nIndeed, interwoven layers of affectivity are unfolded in Otherwise\nthan Being. Levinas explores the sensuous-affective\nproto-experience of the other in light of new moods, writing:\n\u201cRemorse is the trope of the literal sense of sensibility. In\nits passivity is erased the distinction between being accused and\naccusing oneself\u201d (OBBE: 125). Unlike Existence and\nExistents, wherein light overcame the distinction between\nsubjects and objects, allowing the subject to make the object\nintelligible within its horizon of appearing (EE: 41), Otherwise\nthan Being approaches transcendence in sensuous and temporal\nterms, arguing inter alia for the insistence of a past that\neludes thematization (OBBE: 122\u2013123). In that sense,\ntranscendence for an embodied being is always\ntranscendence-in-immanence. The affective \u201cexperience\u201d of\nmy relations with particular others is thus preserved as a trace or\npre-thematic reminiscence of the flesh, as \u201ca relationship with\na singularity without the mediation of any principle, any\nideality\u201d (OBBE: 100). Invoking Otherwise than Being\n(OBBE: 105\u2013107), John Llewelyn has called this affective\ndimension of invested selfhood, or \u201cipseity\u201d, a\n\u201c\u2018deep\u2019 saying\u201d that \u201cbears witness to\nwhat is neither recollected nor forgotten in the epistemic\nsense of these terms when [or once] it is represented as a\nsign\u201d (Llewelyn 2002b:\n 135).[32]\n\nAs indicated, Otherwise than Being problematizes\nLevinas\u2019 earlier, more ontological approach on the basis of\nHusserl\u2019s inquiries into passive syntheses and\nEinf\u00fchlung (empathy). There is good reason for this.\nResponsibility denoted an event that repeats, and even increases as it\nis assumed (already TI: 100\u2013101). In Otherwise than\nBeing, however, the question of immanence and passivity arises in\nregard to responsibility\u2019s unremarked persistence and its\naffective upwellings in us. This is because the status of a memory of\nsensuous events, which affect us before we represent them, is\nelusive. For the phenomenologist, it might correspond to an\napperception or horizon, in the sense of something not directly\nperceived. Thus Levinas also insists that, unlike the apperceptions\nHusserl was able to explore thanks to the reduction he set on\n memory,[33]\nthis affective past continues to elude thematization because\nit was never an intentional object at all, and because memories of our\nlived flesh precede the consolidation of our ego (OBBE:\n144\u2013147). John Drabinski has explored this\n\u201cpre-history\u201d in light of Levinas\u2019 reprise of\ngenetic phenomenology (2001: 185\u2013206). Theodore de Boer\napproaches it as an echo of both Rosenzweig and Jewish prophetism\n(1997: 87\u2013100). Of course, Levinas is aware that such a\ntemporality is open to skeptical critique. He even reminds us that\nskepticism itself obeys an ethical imperative to deconstruct\nphilosophy and with it, all totalizing discourses, whether they are\nlogical or political (OBBE: 168\u2013170).\n\nLevinas does not propose a solution to the conundrum of how\nnon-objective memories can be translated into objects for\nphilosophical reflection. His aim is to deconstruct dialogue down to\nits embodied condition of possibility, and this leads to a discussion\nwhich is not so unlike Husserl\u2019s genetic inquiries into\n\u201cproto-intentionality [Urintentionalit\u00e4t]\u201d\nexplored in the 1920s. Unlike Husserl, however, he does not aim at a\nsystem consisting of levels of drives and affects formatted by higher\negoic structures (Husserl, E Manuscript III 9/5a, cited in\nhu-GDP: lixff). Yet he does exploit a difficulty that beset\nHusserl\u2019s early phenomenology of time-consciousness, one that\nwould argue in favor of Levinas\u2019 1974 conception of\n\u201cdiachrony\u201d, or the interruption that he equates with\ntranscendence-in-immanence. This was the paradox of sensation in\nrelation to intentionality that Husserl identified in Appendix 12 of\nhis lectures on internal time consciousness (Hua 10:\n 130\u2013133).[34]\n In his 1965 essay, \u201cIntentionality and Sensation\u201d (DEH:\n135\u2013150), Levinas focused on the gap (i.e., diachrony) between\nbodily sensation entering intentionality and sensation as\npre-conscious bodily processes. He recalled the paradox that the\nsensuous origins of intentionality lay outside\nintentionality\u2019s field or reach, in the body, even as the\nongoing alterations of sensation forge our feeling of ongoing temporal\nprogression. To be explicitly experienced, sensation thus had\nto intentionalize. Yet much of its prior, bodily existence eludes our\nconsciousness.\n\nLevinas compared this dual, conscious-preconscious status of\nsensibility to his idea of a pre-intentional \u201creceptivity of an\n\u2018other\u2019 penetrating into the \u2018same\u2019, [in sum,\nto our intersubjective] life and not [to] \u2018thought\u2019\u201d\n(DEH: 144). As already broached by Husserl, this sensuous\n\u201cother\u201d will support Levinas\u2019 1974 arguments for the\naffective interruptions of the even flow of time-consciousness, and\nhis claim that intersubjective affects overflow the framework of all\nrepresentational\n consciousness.[35]\n Sophie Veulemans has fruitfully compared Levinas\u2019 diachrony\nwith Bergson\u2019s approach to the \u201cnew\u201d in the midst of\nduration (Veulemans 2008). Rudolf Bernet, in turn, equates the newness\nof the phenomenological instant with \u201cthe root of all alterity\nand all difference\u201d in Levinas, which allows Bernet to urge that\nthe intersubjective investiture of the subject \u201cwill always\n[prove] unthinkable in a philosophy of consciousness\u201d (Bernet\n2002: 92). Following his argument, phenomenology would not have\nadequately thought through the sensuous way \u201cin which the other\nliberates the subject from its captivity within\n \u2026 immanence\u201d (Bernet 2002: 93).\n2.4.3 The Saying and the Said\n\nOtherwise than Being involves an innovative discussion of\nsignification. Given Levinas\u2019 hermeneutic insight that language\nis not merely a system of words paired up with pre-existing, objective\nrealities, but instead brings reality to light, language and time will\nhave analogous functions. That is, both make meaning possible as the\nrealization of our world. Indeed, while Heidegger had argued that\nbeing resonates in (poetic) language, as the verb \u201cto be\u201d,\nLevinas, as we have seen, had counter-argued for an otherwise than\nbeing that showed itself in ad-verbial meaning. Yet, if the\nrelationship between language and being is fully encompassing, even in\na sense mystical, as it is for Heidegger, then either Levinas\u2019\notherwise than being looks like mere speculation, or it simply inheres\nin being or participates in its verb-like transcendence. Either way,\nfundamental ontology thereby proves primordial and weakens\nLevinas\u2019 claims. Yet for the latter, transcendence in fact\npoints to the temporality that, as we have seen, already differs from\nphenomenology\u2019s totalizing flow or the way Heidegger\u2019s\nbeing temporalizes through Da-sein (i.e., as\nout-ahead-of-itself toward its ownmost possibility; OBBE:\n169\u2013170, 178\u2013182). The lapse of time between the\npre-intentional sensuous moment and its intentionalization denotes the\ntranscendence that Levinas also equates with \u201cthe Saying\u201d\n(OBBE: 37\u201355). His discussion of the Saying correlates with his\ntreatment of sincerity, introduced already in Existence and\nExistents. Otherwise than Being radicalizes his notion\nof sincerity, insisting that the structure of sensibility is always as\nif punctuated by sensuous lapses. It is thanks to such time lapses\nthat we are open and able to communicate because, as we have seen,\nproximity is an affective mode that motivates dialogue. While\nall sensuous lapses are not necessarily openings to\nintersubjective communication, proximity and vulnerability are the\nloci of transcendence-in-immanence and the birth of\nsignification (whether words are actually uttered or not). For\nLevinas, there is more in living affectivity than Heidegger\u2019s\nconception of being speaking through language captured. This is clear\nthe moment we understand signification originally as an affective\nproto-intentionality and not as some thought, already formulated, that\nthe I thereupon chooses to communicate to another (OBBE: 43).\n\nLevinas thus conceives language as more than denotation and\ndescription. Already verbs escape the coupling of words with things\nthat we find in the case of the noun. \u201cIn the verb of apophansis\n[predication], which is the verb properly so called, the verb\n\u2018to be\u2019, essence resounds and is heard\u201d (OBBE: 41).\n\u201cRed reddens\u201d without requiring conversion into\npropositions; sounds resound in music and poetry. Nevertheless, a verb\ncan be converted into a noun, thereby losing its processual\nquality. \n\n\nThrough the ambiguousness of the logos \u2026 the verb par excellence\n[\u2018being\u2019] in which essence resounds \u2026 is nominalized,\nbecomes a word designating and sanctioning identities, assembling\ntime \u2026 into a conjuncture. (OBBE: 42) \n\n\nThus, even the verbality or event-like quality of being can take on a\nnominal form, such as in \u201ca being\u201d. Levinas calls\nthis convertibility \u201cthe amphibology of being and\nentities\u201d (OBBE: 43). While this back-and-forth reference\nexpresses the danger of taking being for a thing\u2014a danger about\nwhich Heidegger warns us\u2014the amphibology also fails to grasp\nfully the reflexive quality of verbs like se dire, understood\nas \u201cto say\u201d but in a passive sense, as though one were\nsaying oneself, self-communicating. Levinas then sets\nhis ethical-hermeneutic \u201creduction\u201d on the\nreflexive particle se, urging that, although being\n\u201cspeaks\u201d through the logos, the se\npoints toward an intersubjective mode of our embodied sensuous\npassivity (OBBE: 43\u201345). This passivity is enigmatic because the\nse is not a verb and cannot really be made into a noun. It is\nin its enigmatic structure that the vulnerability that arises in\nproximity as if grounds signification, and words said, to another. To\nthis reflexive se, or \u201cself\u201d, corresponds our\npassivity, as it occurs in the temporal lapse called\n\u201cdiachrony\u201d. Diachrony thus expresses our sincerity toward\nthe other and a certain transcendence: \u201cthe spirit hears the\necho of the otherwise\u201d (OBBBE: 44). With the adverb\n(\u201cotherwise\u201d), a modalization of fleshly\ninvestiture momentarily escapes the nominalization flowing out of the\naforementioned amphibology between verbs and nouns, between being and\na being. Here we find the ultimate sense of transcendence,\nwhich Levinas compares with Merleau-Ponty\u2019s \u201cfundamental\nhistoricity\u201d, those unremarked, passive bodily sedimentations\nthat make up our selfhood (OBBE: 45).\n2.4.4 Hermeneutics and Jewish Philosophy\n\nLevinas\u2019 later work, notably Otherwise than Being, has\nbeen characterized as hermeneutic. Focusing on the discussions of the\nother-in-the-same and passivity in that work, commentator Giuseppe\nLissa provides an apt description of Levinas\u2019 interpretive\nproject. By investigating the depths of consciousness, by comparing\nits passivity to the process of ageing, Levinas investigates a \n\n\nreality unknowable, but perhaps interpretable by a thinking that no\nlonger claims to be an exercise in knowledge \u2026 because this\nthinking is engaged in the search for a meaning that precedes all\nknowledge. \n\n\nLissa concludes that Levinas intimates a meaning that, in\n\u201cpreceding [knowledge], founds it, orients it, and to some\ndegree justifies it\u201d (Lissa 2002: 227). For him, Levinas\u2019\nturn to hermeneutics largely dates from his abandonment of his\nphenomenology of \u201cexteriority\u201d, as the subtitle of\nTotality and Infinity indicates: An Essay on\nExteriority. As we have seen, insofar as the search for meaning\nunderlying intentional object-constitution (and other modes of\nintentionality) presupposes a meaning only incipiently\ngrasped\u2014which corresponds to Heidegger\u2019s rethinking of\nhermeneutics in light of Da-sein\u2019s basic\nunderstanding\u2014Levinas appears to owe a debt both to\nHeidegger\u2019s existential\n hermeneutics[36]\n as well as to a much older, polyphonic practice of reading: Talmudic\nthought as interpretively elaborating Jewish law (Halakhah)\nand recounting and parsing narratives (Aggadah). Because this\nhermeneutics differs from that of Christian theology by giving\nsignificantly less weight to philosophical justifications of\nfaith, it is worth our turning briefly to it.\n\nLevinas presented twenty-three Talmudic readings in the context of the\nColloques des intellectuels juifs de langue fran\u00e7aise.\nHowever, in 1957, at the first meeting of the colloquium, he merely\nparticipated in the debates. Salomon Malka reminds us of one of his\nprofoundly hermeneutic observations: \n\n\nJudaism is not a religion, the word doesn\u2019t exist in Hebrew; it\nis much more than that, it is an understanding of being. The\nJews introduced into history the idea of hope and that of a\nfuture \u2026. Moreover, Jews have the sentiment that their\nobligations toward the other person come before their obligations in\nregard to God. (Malka 2002: 42, my trans., emph. added) \n\n\nThis remark already shows us two important things. First, that Judaism\nmight be an \u201cunderstanding of being\u201d implies that this\nunderstanding is profoundly aware of its finitude and, by extension,\nhas to be an ongoing process. It helps us grasp how it is that Levinas\nfound resources in Heidegger\u2019s hermeneutics, both utilizing\nand criticizing its approach. Second, that our obligations to\nthe other person somehow come before duties toward God (from rituals\nto norms), and occasionally also abrogate these duties, already opens\na secular, or better, a human-oriented dimension within Judaism.\n\nThe relationship between Levinas\u2019 thought, its Jewish\ninfluences, and phenomenological philosophy has given rise to multiple\nevaluations. Martin Kavka argues that \u201cLevinas understood both\nJudaism and Western philosophy as engaging in structurally similar\nforms of thinking\u201d (Kavka 2010: 20\u201321). He situates the\nstructural similarity in that \u201cboth [these intellectual\ncorpuses] consist of texts that point to what cannot be brought to\npresence\u201d and consequently work on, or between, the dimensions\nof reference, explanation, and hermeneutic pre-comprehension (cf.\nOuaknin 1993: 225 [1995:\n 155\u2013156]).[37]\n Yet Kavka adds that Levinas\u2019 relationship to the Jewish canon\nis also \u201cinherently muddy\u201d, though it is also clear that\nthere is more than one canon, more than a single\ninterpretation thereof. Indeed, both Michael Fagenblat and Kavka agree\nthat \u201cit is not clear \u2026 that \u2026 a \u2018new\ndirection\u2019 in Jewish philosophy is [ever] really new\u201d\n(Kavka 2010: 21). Moreover, Fagenblat has argued that Levinas\u2019\nethics prolongs, in a phenomenological-hermeneutic register,\n\u201cthe dispersal of [modern approaches to the] Judeo-Christian God\nin social life\u201d (Fagenblat 2010: 196).[38]\n He also examines the hermeneutic extension that Otherwise than\nBeing gives to Totality and Infinity. Both commentators\nsuggest that Levinas\u2019 increasingly critical stance toward the\nepistemological and foundationalist aspects of Husserlian\nphenomenology motivated him to extend his hermeneutic recourse beyond\nHeidegger\u2019s Existenzphilosophie toward Jewish thought,\nincluding Neo-Platonic currents and Maimonides (Fagenblat 2010:\n97\u2013110).[39]\n,\n[40]\n But it can also be argued that Levinas\u2019 hermeneutics begins\nwell before Otherwise than Being. His reinterpretation of\nbeing-in-the-world, the meaning of facticity, the creation of a\ndwelling, and even his reading of eros and the family in 1961\nentail interpretive choices, indebted to at least two significant\nhermeneutic themes: Heidegger\u2019s interpretation of our\npre-comprehension of existence and Franz Rosenzweig\u2019s approach\nto Jewish life in The Star of Redemption (Rosenzweig 1921\n[2005]).\n\nIn 1961, Levinas wrote that Rosenzweig\u2019s Star of\nRedemption was \u201ctoo often present in this book\n[Totality and Infinity] to be cited\u201d (TI: 28), and\nnumerous are the commentaries on the presence of Rosenzweig in\nLevinas\u2019\n work.[41]\n It is important to recall that Rosenzweig had been a scholar of Hegel\nuntil the experience of the trenches in World War I motivated his\nrethinking of idealist political philosophy and Christian universality\nmore broadly. The Star of Redemption is a complex work\nanalyzing the respective tasks of Jewish and Christian wisdom and\nritual. Peter Eli Gordon argues that Rosenzweig is \n\n\na post-Nietzschean philosopher, in that, like Heidegger, he denies\nthat human meaning is intelligible independent of a life-context.\nTemporal hermeneutics thus replaces the transcendental search for\nessence. (Gordon 2003: 185) \n\n\nThe same could be said of Levinas. Since he conceives temporality in\nhuman terms (as opposed to eternity or stasis), meaning\nitself can only be approached in light of time. Readers familiar with\nRosenzweig\u2019s \u201cnew thinking\u201d may know that he\nsituated one of the principal hermeneutic differences between Judaism\nand Christianity in the way their theologies\n\u2018temporalized\u2019: Christianity being oriented around the\nlife and death of the incarnate God, an event whose occurrence lies in\nthe past; Judaism, on the other hand, being future-oriented, awaiting\nthe messiah (who does not come).\n\nLevinas took up the question of meaning and temporality in a way\nsomewhat different from both Rosenzweig and Heidegger. In 1961, as we\nhave seen, his phenomenology of hospitality proceeded on the\npresent-time of love of life and the encounter called the\nface-to-face. However, the place where he explicitly uses the term\n\u201cphenomenology\u201d therein concerns precisely a secularized\nmessianic future. This is the chapter entitled \u201cPhenomenology of\nEros\u201d, which deploys \u201ca phenomenological model for the\nultimate term of our desire\u201d, as Fagenblat puts it (2010:\n93). The argument would be this: before eros is sublimated in\ncivil society, eros and (sometimes) the family bring to light\nour concern with others in their particularity and difference,\nindependently of their biological or social roles. We can take the\nfamily as a \u201cmodel\u201d here, in the Frankfurt School\u2019s\nsense of\n\n\n\nan intellectual construction \u2026 [whose elements] are borrowed from\nempirical experiences that have already shown their worth such that\nthe elements used appear henceforth obvious. (Broch 2008: 43) \n\n\nThe phenomenology of eros opens a future of\n\u201celection\u201d within the family and perhaps beyond it.\nDespite the apparent heterosexism of his formulations, Levinas\nintroduces abiding concern for singularity and uniqueness by defining\nthe figure of paternity as the possibility of electing each son in his\nspecificity, even as the latter may serve (and clash with) his\nbrothers. Consistent with a model, the family is both figure and\nreality. It serves Levinas\u2019 hermeneutic secularization of\nmessianic future-time through the succession of generations.\nInterestingly, eros unfolds \u201cphenomenologically\u201d\nin much the same way as did the proto-experience of the \u201cthere\nis\u201d (il y a). That is, it unfolds in a darkness\noverlooked by phenomenologies that rely on light and the universal\nevidence that light enables (TI: 256). There would consequently be a\nneglected underside to the phenomenological account of\nobject-constitution, which precedes and accompanies\nintentionality\u2019s encounter with objects. And that\nrequires hermeneutics.\n\nLike Fagenblat, scholars from David Banon to Marc-Alain Ouaknin have\nexplored the hermeneutic dimension of Levinas\u2019 thought, even\nbeyond his Talmudic readings that delve into the many-voiced debates\nbetween the rabbis of the Mishna and the Gemara (the oldest and\nsubsequent transcriptions of Jewish oral traditions; Banon 1987).\nIndeed, as Ouaknin points out, in the case of Talmudic and Biblical\nhermeneutics, Levinas always considered the eminence of a\nbook\u2014what defines it as \u201cthe Book\u201d\u2014to be less\nits themes than its structure. Levinas focuses \u201con the\nstructure of the Book of books inasmuch as it allows for exegesis\n[hermeneutics], and on its unique status of containing more than it\n contains\u201d.[42]\n Hermeneutics is thus engendered by excesses of potential\nmeaning over senses already printed on the page, or even discerned by\nthe reception traditions of the work. It would thus be the specific\narchitecture of the book that conditions its reception. Moreover, the\nparallelisms that we have seen\u2014between the Saying and the Said\nand between temporal diachrony and synchrony\u2014are also\nfound at the literary level in Biblical and Talmudic texts, with their\nopenness to ongoing interpretation. Levinas even equates\n\u201crevelation\u201d with the call of the text to each\nreader or listener, who thereby becomes responsible for its\ninterpretation. \u201cThe Revelation as calling to the unique within\nme is the significance particular to the signifying of the\nRevelation\u201d of the text, which is understood as dialogical to\nits core. Here we see the structural analogy between the call of the\nother and my response that begins as Saying, as opening to words\naddressed. Levinas adds, \n\n\nthe totality of the true is constituted from the contribution of\nmultiple people, the uniqueness of each act of listening carrying the\nsecret of the text; the voice of the Revelation, as\ninflected \u2026 by each person\u2019s ear, would be necessary to the\n\u2018Whole\u2019 of the truth. (BTV: 133\u2013134) \n\n\nHermeneutic truth here becomes the responsibility of an open\ncommunity, as much as an invitation to participation extended to each\npossible listener. That is why Levinas could urge that Scripture be\nunderstood as a call to respond as readily as could proximity,\nsubstitution, and responsibility, all of which similarly express the\nethical investiture that results in words offered.\n\nLevinas\u2019 hermeneutics might nevertheless be deemed immanent,\nconcerning one book and one community. Although commentators like\nBatnitzky find in Levinas a project for a modern politics, and thus\nfor universality, others are skeptical about her claim. Trigano\nobjects that Levinas\u2019 ethics unfolds out of a sort of non-site,\nstarting with the category of the singular. \u201cFor Levinas\u201d,\nhe argues, \n\n\nit is ethically imperative to think the singular in order that the\nhorizon of the other person arise. The universal is, in effect, a\ndangerous game that can lead to totality and to the negation of the\nother person. To decide in favor of the singular is to avoid such a\ndevelopment \n\n\nand with it, a politics (Trigano 2002: 173). In short, the original\nhermeneutic turn that Levinas gives to Husserlian and Heideggerian\nphenomenologies has left commentators with questions about the\nrelationship between an immanent hermeneutics and one concerned with\npolitics as the sphere of the universal. These questions imply\ndiscussions about politics in our time from which Levinas\nwould have refrained in his time, in the wake of the Shoah, when\npolitics seemed less important than questions of the survival and\nfuture of Jewish communities. Yet this apparent absence of politics\nexplains why Michel Haar (1991: 530) asked of Levinas whether his\nethics could really unfold outside any site, outside any positive\nreciprocity, and outside all objectivation (cited by Trigano 2002:\n175, note 79). Indeed, Trigano criticizes Levinas, urging that the\ndialectical relationship between singular experience and universal\nmeaning (and institutions) implies that philosophy should have a\nminimal relationship to politics, \n\n\nwhich is the very field in which the disjunction between the universal\nand the singular \u2026 is established, and this disjunction\u2014so\nfar as it is at once the separation of the same and the other and\n[yet] also the path of their alliance \u2026 is the very condition of\npossibility of the other. (Trigano 2002: 176) \n\n\nOn Trigano\u2019s account, it follows that Levinas\u2019\nhermeneutics only partly responded to Jews\u2019 post-war need for\nthe universalization of their experience, at a human level\nencompassing both theory and politics (Trigano 2002: 176). This does\nnot contradict Batnitzky\u2019s reading, which considers\nLevinas\u2019 \u0153uvre as a whole. But it can certainly be\nargued that universalization in Levinas\u2019 ethics remains largely\nformal. On this question turns the important matter of what it means\nto develop a Jewish philosophy. And it is fair to say that\n\n\n\nthe universal, the neo-Kantian ethicization of Judaism emerged in\nruins from the Shoah, the more so that the essential question of\npolitical philosophy today is that of the place of the singular within\nthe political universal. (Trigano 2002: 177) \n\n\nIf we accept this claim, then any comparison between Levinas and a\npre-Shoah Jewish thinker goes only part way toward addressing the\nproblem of Jewish hermeneutic philosophy today.\n2.4.5 The Third Party, Illeity, and Politics\n\nJacques Derrida once called Totality and Infinity a\n\u201ctreatise on hospitality\u201d (1997 [1999: 21]). As we have\nseen, Levinas\u2019 1961 work approached being as war or a conflict\nof wills that persist in their existence like the philosophical\ntradition\u2019s concept of conatus essendi (the will to\npersist in being). Neutral existence or the there-is (il\ny a) denoted indeterminate nocturnal being, which gives way to\nthe diurnal being called \u201cthe elemental\u201d (sunlight, winds,\nrain). As noted, being in Levinas thus entails both dynamic forces and\na conception of natural processes and causality. However, hospitality,\nalso called \u201cmetaphysical desire\u201d (TI: 33), cannot be\ngrounded on such forces, much less on a conception of the will as\nbased on drives of self-preservation or self-expansion. And, because\nhospitality is elicited by the other\u2014and is\nnon-reciprocal\u2014it does not presuppose an original social\nexchange, much less moral sentiments or innate emotive capacities for\nempathy or compassion. If it did, there would be no question of\nescaping a so-called natural order of existence. That is why\nLevinas\u2014aware that the concept of nature has a debated\nhistory\u2014characterizes both our response to the other and, in\n1974, proximity, as \u201cpre-natural signification\u201d (OBBE:\n68). He explains, \n\n\n[i]n renouncing intentionality as a guiding thread toward the\neidos [formal structure] of the psyche \u2026 our analysis\nwill follow sensibility in its pre-natural signification to the\nmaternal, where, in proximity [to what is not itself], signification\nsignifies before it gets bent into perseverance in\nbeing in the midst of a Nature. (OBBE: 68, emph. added) \n\n\nIn order to clarify this, Levinas had to develop further concepts. In\n1961, he referred to our desire for the other as\n\u201creligion\u201d (\u201cthe bond \u2026 established between the\nsame and the other\u201d that does not totalize) and as\n\u201ctransascendence\u201d. \u201cTranscendence, like desire and\ninadequation, is necessarily a transascendence\u201d (respectively\nTI: 41, 35). By 1974, Levinas calls \u201cilleity\u201d the value\nand dignity of responding to another person. He defines illeity as\n\n\n\na neologism formed with il (he) or ille, [whereby\nalterity] indicates a way of concerning me without entering into\nconjunction with me. (OBBE: 12; also 13\u201316, 147\u2013162) \n\n\nBeyond the concept of the third party introduced in Totality and\nInfinity, \u201cilleity\u201d also refers to something\nabsolute, even divine, in the other. We can see here how our\nresponsibility to the other person thus almost stands in the place of\nour responsibility to God, which, as we have seen, is an important\nhermeneutic dimension of Judaism.\n\nThe question remains, as it did already in Totality and\nInfinity: How do responsibility and transcendence thereupon enter\ninto the ongoing flow of time and the totality of being? And how does\nan investiture of this affective intensity pass into rationality? As\nin the 1961 work, we find in 1974 that the \u201cthird\nparty\u201d\u2014denoting both other people and the reprise of\nintentionality\u2014similarly \u201clooks at me through the eyes of\nthe other\u201d (TI: 213). Here too the passage to reason, social\nexistence, and objective time occurs because the temporal lapse called\n\u201cdiachrony\u201d is invariably reabsorbed by intentional\nconsciousness. On this point, Levinas accords Husserl his argument\nthat affects are always on the verge of becoming intentional (Hua 10:\nAppendix 12). The responsibility and fraternity, which are now\nformulated as the unfathomable other-in-the-same, still leave a\ntrace in social relations. And, faithful to his 1961 project, the\ntrace is not framed as metaphysical. It is found, rather, in our\nconcern for restorative justice, even for modest equity. This concern\nfor justice does not erase the Hobbesian or Machiavellian nature of\nhuman drives. In 1974, however, the difficulty of holding together the\npassive temporality (which Levinas likens to ageing, [OBBE: 54])\nwith the flowing time of intentional consciousness and social\nrationality, has become more obvious. Levinas inquires, \u201cDoes a\nface abide in representation and in proximity; is it\ncommunity and difference?\u201d (OBBE: 154, emph. added).\nUndecidable, this is a question for us as well: \n\n\nThe third party introduces a contradiction in the saying whose\nsignification before the other until then went in one direction\n[toward the singular other]. It is of itself the limit of\nresponsibility and the birth of the question: What do I have to do\nwith justice? A question of consciousness. (OBBE: 157)\n\n\nWith the return to a philosophy of consciousness and representation,\nthe indispensable figure of the trace that Levinas has introduced\nbecomes attenuated. As we have seen, to confront eventual skepticism\nabout the trace, he enacts his witness in a literary here and\nnow. His figural performance points not toward another world or to a\nbeing different from that discussed by Heidegger, so much as to the\nintensities and vulnerability of pre-conscious affectivity.\nLevinas\u2019 writing thus appears to come down to a poetics of the\ninexpressible. Nevertheless, since he also demands that we reflect on\nintersubjectivity from a standpoint outside the face-to-face\nencounter, his work gives us a double task: conceptualization\nand the as-if of an enacted here-and-now. Still, justice does\nnot only come down to the question \u201cwhat do I have to do with\njustice?\u201d It entails an additional explanatory move that Levinas\ncannot make. This move would have to account for what the\nother means to the third party, and why third parties insist that\n\u201cI\u201d also receive just treatment. These are questions\nrequiring a systematic perspective, outside the now-moment in which\n\u201cI\u201d emerge and enact my witness, affectively invested by\nalterity (OBBE: 158).\n\nThe equalizing situation from which comparison, justice, and\nnormativity can be deduced is beyond Levinas\u2019 immediate\nconcern. Such a situation is that of objective consciousness. This is,\nfor example, the approach adopted by Hegel in the Phenomenology of\nSpirit, which he calls the \u201cfor-us\u201d or the\nexternalist standpoint (Hegel 1807 [1977: \u00a725]). Levinas thus\nsimply marks this standpoint, which is for him a conundrum, saying,\n\n\n\n[t]he relationship with the third party is an incessant correction of\nthe asymmetry of proximity in which the face is looked at. There is\nweighing, thought, objectification \u2026 in which my anarchic\nrelationship with illeity [transcendence] is betrayed \u2026 There is\nbetrayal of my anarchic relation with illeity, but also a new\nrelationship with it: it is only thanks to God that, as a\nsubject incomparable with the other, I am approached as an other by\nthe others, that is, \u201cfor myself\u201d. (OBBE: 158, emph.\nadded) \n\n\nWould Levinas\u2019 \u201cthanks to God\u201d then stand in the\nplace of Hegel\u2019s \u201cfor-us\u201d account?\n\nCommentators differ on the interpretation of the phrase \u201cthanks\nto God\u201d. In his subsequent use of the expression, Levinas sets\nthese words between quotation marks. Franck interprets the new concept\nof illeity as denoting the force of proximity and the dignity\nof my investiture by the other. It is the \n\n\nHe [illeity] in whose trace the Thou or the face that intends and\nassigns me signifies \u2026 [But] the He \u2026 does not point toward\nanother world in which the phenomenological and ontological orders\nwould nevertheless prevail \u2026 [Rather, as Levinas says,] \u201cit\nis the \u2026 Infinity of the absolutely other, escaping\nontology\u201d. (Franck 2008: 109, my trans.) \n\n\n\u201cIlleity\u201d thus points to an indeterminate place or source,\nthe sheer dignity of the other who faces me, or the other always\nalready motivating my saying. Yet despite this, Levinas sometimes\nextends illeity to the possibility of my receiving justice\nfrom other people. He writes, \u201cthanks to God\n[Il] \u2026 I am approached as an other by the others\u201d\n(OBBE: 158). But, of course, even if universal justice is\n\u201cthanks to God\u201d, this God is not part of\nbeing (OBBE: 162)\u2014a claim familiar to both negative theology and\nto Maimonides\u2019 ultimate approach to God through human action.\nLevinas is fully aware of the paradox he introduces into\n\u201cilleity\u201d. And he clearly knows the theological reversion\nto praxis that Maimonides proposes at the end of his\nGuide of the Perplexed: \u201cThe only positive knowledge of\nGod of which man is capable is knowledge of the attributes of\naction\u201d \n (Fagenblat 2010: 113).[43]\n As Levinas puts it, \u201cto know God is to know what must be\ndone\u201d (DF: 17). It is not to know some being or even to erect a\nregulative idea. The dignity and force of illeity thus share an\nimportant connection with what we might call our enacting God\nthrough responsibility to the other or through justice. Another word\nfor this is \u201choliness\u201d, whether this comes from me in the\nform of the Saying or from the others as justice toward me.\n\nHere lies the point at which a reading begins that bridges the\nphilosophical and the religious\u2014above all the\nTalmudic\u2014dimensions of Levinas\u2019 thought. Indeed, as he put\nit in his 1966 article \u201cInfinity\u201d (AT: 53\u201376): \n\n\nAn entire strain of contemporary philosophy, setting out from the\nirreducibility of the interpersonal to relations of objectivity,\nthematization, and knowledge, is situated in the religious tradition\nof the idea of the infinite \u2026 even when it expresses itself in a\ndeliberately and rigorously atheistic way. (AT: 76, emph.\nadded)\n\n\nThat suggests that whether we approach it atheistically or\nreligiously, the tension between interpersonal relations and\nobjectivity implies the third party and by extension a social\nrelationality which is indissociable from justice and politics. But it\nis not clear that Levinas ever decided whether politics implied above\nall war or the means toward a peaceable State. In his late essay\n\u201cPeace and Proximity\u201d (1984; col-BPW: 161\u2013169),\nLevinas expressed an attitude surprisingly favorable to the idea of\nthe politics which, when the State is a liberal one, evinces palpable\naspects of the trace of responsibility in its policies. \n\n\nIt is not without importance to know\u2014and this is perhaps the\nEuropean experience of the twentieth century\u2014whether the\negalitarian and just State [and its politics] in which the European is\nfulfilled \u2026 proceeds from a war of all against all\u2014or from\nthe irreducible responsibility of the one for the other. (In Rolland,\ned. 1984, 346, my trans.) \n\n\nOf course, the notion of a just politics has meant different things\naccording to the form the State takes, whether totalitarian,\nauthoritarian, or\n liberal.[44]\n Given his evocations of a pluralist or multilayered existence in\nTotality and Infinity (TI: 19, 80, 306), Levinas\u2019\nargument that justice is marked by the trace of responsibility seems\nto accord relatively well with liberal theories of political justice\nand sovereignty. As is well known, Anglo-American theorists of\nsovereignty and politics emphasize that individuals live in multiple\nsocial associations, which impose a host of responsibilities on them.\nA pluralistic socio-political existence diminishes the emphasis on\nsovereignty as concentrated in the State alone. Be that as it may,\nLevinas\u2019 notion of a trace of responsibility within justice does\nnot explain how other people, not just I, can be said to be ethically\n\u201cinvested\u201d by responsibility. That I receive justice from\nthem thus remains \u201cthanks to God\u201d. Moreover, what is true\nof ethical systems may well be true of political ones. That is,\nfollowing his comprehensive comparison of Levinas\u2019 philosophy\nwith contemporary theories of ethics, Morgan admits: \n\n\nI do not think that Levinas would favor any particular moral\nsystem\u2014say, some form of Kantian morality or of\nconsequentialism, insofar as it is a system. (2007: 456,\nemph. added) \n\n\nThis may be true of any form of political regime as well, because for\nLevinas politics attempts to forge systems\u2014as he says, to\ntotalize (TI: 15, 21, 292\u2013305). We have seen above Rose\u2019s\nneo-Hegelian objection that Levinas\u2019 ethics lacks mediations\nsufficient to have real implications for politics\n (\u00a72.3.4).\n Recently, Salanskis has nevertheless proposed a surprising\n\u201cmediation\u201d, found in Judaism itself, arguing that the\nlatter provides an \u201cidealist horizon liable to interest all\nof humanity\u201d, because it ties this horizon narratively\n\u201cto a practical and intellectual testing\n\u2018laboratory\u2019, that of the life of a people\u201d\n(Salanskis 2016: 129, note 68). This claim suggests that there is a\nproto-political project in Biblical and Talmudic Judaism, though\nSalanskis leaves unexplored the further implications of his\n\u201claboratory\u201d. As to the political implications of the\nTalmud\u2019s pluralism of rabbinic voices, which is part of\nSalanskis\u2019 laboratory, Levinas does at times emphasize the\nimportance of Jewish thought entering into \u201cuniversal\nhistory\u201d, even while promoting responsibility for others and the\nethics of messianic awaiting (DF: 96). For example, in his Talmudic\nreading entitled \u201cMessianic Texts\u201d (1962), he justifies\nthe creation of a Jewish State on the basis of the possibility of\nprotecting both messianic patience and a Talmudic education to\nresponsibility, despite the violence implied by Israel becoming\none State among others, within universal and secular history\n(also see Morgan 2016: 256\u2013265, responding to Kavka 2015).\n\nLet us focus for a moment more directly on this question of justice in\nJewish thought. Insofar as we can speak of one Jewish\nphilosophical tradition, notably a modern one, the question of justice\nforms the core of its approach to the prophetic message. In\nthat respect it would certainly have a political dimension; or, at the\nleast, a social-existential one. It may be that to answer the question\nof the politics (in the minimal sense of State policies) liable to\nemerge from Levinas\u2019 ethics requires that we pay close attention\nto his philosophical anthropology, i.e., to his conception of\nthe human condition or what it means to be a human being. Recently,\nSarah Hammerschlag has returned to Levinas\u2019 captivity notebooks\nin which he jotted his wartime insights into Judaism as he lived it\nthen: \n\n\nJ. [might be compared to] a splinter in the flesh. One might live\nwithout it, but if one didn\u2019t have [this source of suffering],\nmy life [would be deprived] of its acuity \u2026 or fallen back into\ninfancy. (LO1: 172, my trans.) \n\n\nThis conception of a Jewish \u201canthropology\u201d corresponds not\nto particular Jews, but to our human condition when we understand it\nas a condition largely received, passively and without our\nexplicit choice. As Hammerschlag and Fagenblat have urged, this human\npathos, consistent with a pluralistic ontology, might well be\napproached as an existential category (Hammerschlag 2012:\n 389\u2013419).[45]\n This too is why Levinas characterized Judaism as \u201can\nunderstanding of being\u201d, rather than as a religion. Yet this\ncategory may surprise us if we overlook the fact that a definitive\npart of our existence does comes from without, i.e., through the\ninternalization of the life of our community, its founding texts, but\nalso through social and political characterizations of us\n(antisemitism, racism, sexism).\n\nApproached as unbidden passivity, of course, the existential category\ncalled Judaism raises the question of other passive ascriptions and\ntheir implications for the question of what it means to be a\nhuman being. If, by 1974, politics and the third party are largely\nsynonyms for \u201chumanity\u201d for Levinas, then we must conclude\nthat politics has, by extension, become more for him than the conflict\nand strife he described in his preface to Totality and\nInfinity (TI: 21\u201325). Politics would have to take seriously\na pluralistic humanism, as well as the condition of passive\nascriptions including racism. The implication is that one may\nsometimes have a choice, in one\u2019s actions, about whether\npolitics is indeed a war of all against all or the site in which\ntraces of justice toward the other can be demanded. However that may\nbe, some commentators have raised the concern that\n\u201chumanity\u201d for Levinas looks basically like\nHusserl\u2019s rationalist ideal of humanity (Husserl 1954 [1970:\n275], cited by McGettigan 2006: 16). This would be the humanity of\nEurope, and beneath that, one flowing out of the intertwined\nvoices of \u201cAthens\u201d and\n \u201cJerusalem\u201d.[46]\n To be sure, the Biblical prophets demanded justice (and repentance)\nfrom their wayward communities. But political justice requires a\npublic space, an agora in which the agorein (public\nspeaking) gives rise to categories of thought\n(kat\u2019agorein means to accuse publicly).\n\nThis dual preoccupation with justice as rectitude, and justice as\ncivic virtue, seems to suggest that together Athens and Jerusalem give\nus a comprehensive approach to politics, as both practice and ideal.\nDrabinski and Fred Moten have questioned this universality (Drabinski\n2011: 165\u2013196), and with it the category of\n\u201cbeing-Jewish\u201d, in favor of an emphasis on the passivity\nintrinsic to a multiplicity of human situations, including\nrace, ethnicity, and gender. Moreover, as Moten cautions, passivity\ncan be readily observed in our relations to things rather\nthan persons. He thus adds that the Bible and the Greeks, although\noften presented as \u201cthe whole world\u201d, thereby become a\nteleological reflection that expresses an unacknowledged European\nmalaise, wherein the non-European receives the status of a\nmere object (Moten 2018: 9, 11). Attributing this to the transcendence\ntoward-the-world of phenomenological intentionality, which shares some\nof the blind spots of the colonial enterprise, Moten discusses the\nobject-like passivity of being on the receiving end of multiple\nracisms, including Levinas\u2019 own \u201cunintended racism\u201d.\nIf we take his concern seriously, then passivity as a category of\nbeing-human strains against being attributed to Jews alone. In turn,\nthis raises the philosophical-anthropological question of situational\npassivities, the very idea of humanity, and those \u201cbeings\u201d\nthat inhabit worlds unacknowledged by the European tradition (Moten\n2018: 17). While this is a critique of Levinas, Moten also invites us\nto expand the latter\u2019s anthropological category of being-Jewish,\nand to ask ourselves what kind of politics might flow out of such an\n expansion.[47]\n\n2.5 Essays and Interviews after Otherwise than Being: The Tension between Ethics and Justice\n\nSubsequent to Otherwise than Being,Levinas\u2019 works\nreturn to and refine his major themes. These works include\nTranscendence and Intelligibility (1984), In the Time of\nthe Nations (1988), Entre Nous (1991), and Alterity\nand Transcendence (1995), all of which are collections of essays\nfrom various periods between 1951 and 1989. However, the first of\nthese collections to appear, entitled Of God Who Comes to\nMind (1982), contains the important essay \u201cGod and\nPhilosophy\u201d (1975; OGCM: 55\u201378), which is a critical\nconfrontation with the God of Descartes and Malebranche, and a subtle\ndebate with Heidegger. This essay is followed by the transcript of a\ntwo-hour discussion with professors from the University of Leyden\n(OGCM: 79\u201399), in which social problems infrequently addressed\nby Levinas are\n raised.[48]\n Despite the wide temporal gamut run by these publications, we find\nfew new developments, other than a clearer resolve to address the\nambiguity intrinsic to the signifier \u201cGod\u201d (OGCM:\n\u00a7\u00a710\u201313, 17\u201319), and the verbal dynamics of\nbeing (corresponding to Heidegger\u2019s Wesen), henceforth\ncharacterized by Levinas\u2019 neologism\n\u201cessance\u201d (OGCM: 43\u201351).\n\nHowever, Franck has detected a profound divergence in these new\ndevelopments. In a highly sophisticated reading of the essays and\ninterviews written or given after Otherwise than Being, he\nnotes that the tension between the two aforementioned conceptions of\njustice (that of 1961 and that of 1974) has come to look like an\nepistemological inconsistency. This inconsistency is due to\nLevinas\u2019 later choice to hold justice and (empirical) social\nlife at a significant distance from each other. Indeed, by\nprogressively aligning justice with transcendence, Levinas runs into\nan important difficulty after 1974. That is, either justice belongs to\nresponsibility from the outset (1961), whereupon the \u201cthird\nparty\u201d refers simply to the tendency of intentional\nconsciousness to reconnect any sensuous gaps in itself, or\nresponsibility and transcendence firstly require justice in\norder to be pondered and communicated. In other words, for Franck,\neither justice and responsibility are co-originary, in which case\nresponsibility cannot leave a trace in justice and being, or\nresponsibility itself presupposes justice, a constituted\nworld, and linguistic concepts. In the first case, that of aligning\nresponsibility and justice, the third party would simply denote\neveryday consciousness (TI). In the second case, justice would in fact\ngravitate toward illeity, the \u201cHe-ness\u201d of the absent God\n(OBBE and after). Once again, in the first case and in terms of lived\ntime, the third party is indeed largely simultaneous with the other,\ngiven our social life and context. As Franck explains, we clearly live\nin society and any phenomenological description must operate\nwithin reflection, which is also the domain called the third party.\nBut in the second case, if we hold the third party close to illeity,\nthen the question why I receive justice \u201cfor\nmyself\u201d from others can only be answered\nquasi-theologically, as \u201cthanks to God\u201d. Yet this second\noption shifts our attention from justice within social life toward the\nenigma posed by the fact that I do receive justice from\nothers thanks to some near-miraculous concern of theirs for me. But\nthen, should justice for all refer to our social and legal contexts or\nrather to an absolute called illeity? Mobilizing extensive arguments,\nFranck shows that this difficulty comes into a crude light in the late\nworks. And indeed, if the later Levinas chooses to hold these two\nconceptions together, then justice is both social and in some sense\ndivine, like a godly justice or a theopolitics (Franck 2008: 239). If\nit is the latter, then Levinas\u2019 hermeneutics of an ethical\n\u201cotherwise than being\u201d just amounts to an abstraction\nrooted essentially in theology. \n\nAs if anticipating Franck\u2019s strong, structural critique, Levinas\nstaked out a surprising claim for the social simultaneity of the other\nand the third party in a 1982 interview entitled \u201cPhilosophy,\nJustice, and Love\u201d (EN: 103\u2013122). He there argues, \n\n\nI do not live in a world where there is but one \u2018first\ncome\u2019. There is always a third [party] in the world; he too\nis my other, my neighbor. Consequently, it matters to me to know\nwhich of the two passes first: is the one not the persecutor of the\nother? Must men, [although understood] as incomparable, not be\ncompared? Justice is thus prior here to taking the\nother\u2019s fortunes upon oneself. (EN: 103\u2013104, emph. added)\n\n\n\nThe supposed priority of the other would thus depend on one\u2019s\napproach, which can be ethical or socio-juridical. Indeed, the problem\nof priority is further complicated by the fact that, as early as 1974,\nLevinas cited Isaiah 57:19, deliberately inverting the order of the\nterms, \u201cneighbor\u201d and \u201cthe one far away\u201d. He\nthus writes, \u201cPeace to the neighbor and to the distant\none\u201d (OBBE: 157). Eleven years later, he corrects his citation\nin an interview entitled \u201cOn Jewish Philosophy\u201d (1985;\nITN: 167\u2013183): \u201c\u2018Peace, peace, to him that is far\noff and to him that is near\u2019, says the Eternal\u201d. And he\nadds, \n\n\nOutside the one who is near \u2026 he who is far off compels\nrecognition. Outside the other there is the third party. He is\nalso an other, also a neighbor. But which is the closest\nproximity? [\u2026] There must be knowledge of such things! (ITN:\n172, emph. added)\n\n\nAs a critical reader of Levinas, Franck appears to be the only\ncommentator who has raised Levinas\u2019 later remarks to the status\nof epistemological inconsistency. Franck argues cogently that if we\nmust be able to determine whether the third party is also an other, or\na persecutor of others, or a criminal, then justice must\nprecede responsibility, rather than the reverse. That is,\nrather than responsibility grounding justice thanks to the trace it\nleaves within justice, the latter must have priority (2008,\n240\u2013242). Franck\u2019s objection has important implications\nfor the relationship between ethics and politics in Levinas. We live\nin human society, and we cannot escape that, he says. But does this\nnot imply that it is impossible to set justice decisively outside\npolitics, and as if outside ontology, as Levinas\u2019 later work\nseems to do? That also means that we can never separate the sincerity\nthat Levinas calls \u201cthe Saying\u201d (or le dire) from\nthe very words (le dit) that express and describe it. We\ntherefore need words, and intentionality, to make what Levinas\ncharacterized as the pre-thematic into a theme (OBBE: 99). We even\nneed words to stabilize the affect called sincerity or the Saying.\nFailing words, sincerity and with it proximity are simply\nabstractions, philosophical constructions. There is nothing wrong\nper se with such philosophical constructs, if that is what\nthese concepts are. It is illegitimate, however, to argue that they\nprecede intentional consciousness and even reflection.\n\nNow, given Otherwise than Being\u2019s\nrapprochement between the third party and illeity, must the\nthird party not admit two distinct, even irreconcilable senses? The\n1961 sense would still refer to social existence and the moderation of\nresponsibility, while the 1974 sense would henceforth point to a\nradically absent Il, also called \u201cGod\u201d. This too\nhas consequences for the question of justice\u2014i.e., whether it is\nprimary to Levinas\u2019 existential ethics, or secondary and largely\nderivative from responsibility. As we know, the Jewish tradition, and\nothers as well, holds the judge responsible for fair decisions; this\nspecialist of laws is also a member of the community and must obey the\nLaw he adjudicates. This is more than simply a platitude; the\njudge\u2019s dual status casts light on the competing priorities of\nresponsibility versus justice. To explain his positions Levinas recurs\nto Psalm 82: \u201cGod stands in the divine assembly, among the\ndivine beings. He pronounces judgment\u201d. In other words, only if\nilleity refers to a transcendent absolute, viz., \u201cGod in the\ndivine assembly\u201d, can the third party (understood as the others\nor society) be raised above an everyday social function and confer on\njustice something like a regulative idea able to preserve a trace of\ntranscendence.\n\nLevinas\u2019 reference to Psalm 82 is less surprising than we might\nsuppose. Echoing Carl Schmitt\u2019s Political Theology,\nFagenblat points out, firstly, that all the important concepts in\nmodern statehood theory are secularized religious ideas. But,\nsecondly, the secularization process does not stop with statehood\ntheory, \u201ca similar phenomenon applies to secular moral\nconcepts\u201d (Fagenblat 2010: xi, emph. added). \nIn short, \u201cGod\u201d\nis the crucial name for an absolute, indispensable to justice\nunderstood as an ongoing project. To be sure, for Franck, the\nreference to a \u201cGod\u201d who judges is less a problem of\nsecularization than a reason why it is impossible to argue\nfor the priority of responsibility over justice. And this is\ntrue whether the priority is defined as ontological or\npractical. But Franck fails to acknowledge that Levinas is aware of\nthis tension. In \u201cPhilosophy, Justice, and Love\u201d, Levinas\ndraws a complex portrait of the third party as \u201cGod\u201d based\non a new, and crucial, distinction between the meaning of\n\u201cGod\u201d as Elohim and \u201cGod\u201d as the\nTetragrammaton (YHWH; EN:\n 108).[49]\n In the rabbinic tradition, Elohim, God of justice, first\ncreated the world. That world did not survive by itself; that is,\nwithout the \u201csupplement\u201d provided by YHWH, the God of\nmercy. Hence, the necessity of a second creation where justice was\nmore than equal treatment.\n\nGiven the mythic alignment of Elohim with justice, and YHWH\nwith mercifulness, Levinas argues that illeity has two\npossible modalizations: justice or equity; mercy or compassion. The\npriority of one God thus depends on the perspective we adopt: justice\nwould belong to ontology, compassion to an ethical perspective. For\nFagenblat, the ethical priority emerges as the possibility of creating\nand safeguarding meaning\u2014by extension, as creation tout\ncourt (2010: 44\u201353). \nThat is, in Biblical symbolism, when read in the\nrabbinic tradition, a world created first on justice (as equality and\ncomparison) does not survive, because demands for equality (and with\nthem, for blind justice) are unceasing and do not admit an outside or\ntranscendent term allowing for considerations beyond bilateral\ncomparison. It is the transcendent term, the outside as it were, that\nmotivates justice to strive asymptotically towards an idea. That is\nwhy Levinas observes that being human implies that we are certainly\nborn into a social world, a world of many others and third parties.\nBut we are sustained, and individuated, by mercy. Moreover, mercy\nrepresents, for justice, the trace of responsibility. This becomes\nclear only when one reads Levinas\u2019 philosophy together with his\nTalmudic texts.\n\nFor this and other reasons, the all-important question of the priority\nof responsibility as against justice must be approached as a complex\none, in part dependent on lived circumstances. From the\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d perspective that Levinas defined as desire\nfor the other in Totality and Infinity (TI: 39),\nresponsibility and proximity come first (EN: 107\u2013108). From the\nperspective of practice and our living-in-society, justice stands\ncloser to ethics and may sometimes precede it. G\u00e9rard Bensussan\nhas pondered this question in light of the Christian tradition in the\nWest, for which Judaism already represents an alterity\u2014in text\nand in act; for example, when the Passover seder re-enacts the escape\nfrom enslavement in Egypt, it ritually recalls: \u201cstrangers we\nwere, and thus, strangers we are\u201d, even now (Bensussan\n2008: 78). A more rigorously philosophical reckoning may require that\nthe relationship between the two perspectives, justice and mercy, be\nfurther clarified. Be that as it may, this is one point on which the\nJewish writings of Levinas enrich, even ground, his philosophical\narguments.\n3. Concluding Remarks\n\nCommentators have differed on the comparative importance of\nLevinas\u2019 major works, Totality and Infinity and\nOtherwise than Being. Some have urged that we see in them two\nsides of a single coin: that of responsibility experienced in the\nface-to-face encounter and that of the insistence of an affective\ntrace that interrupts flowing time as conceived by classical\nphenomenology (Peperzak 1993: 7). Other commentators have argued that\nOtherwise than Being is Levinas\u2019 magnum\n opus,[50]\n a study on the intersubjective pre-conditions of language indebted\nto, yet diverging from, Heidegger\u2019s investigations of the poetic\nlogos (in which man dwells and being is intimated; Heidegger\nhe-EHP: 59\u201364). As we have seen, Derrida called Totality and\nInfinity a \u201ctreatise on hospitality\u201d (see\n \u00a72.4.1 above)\n and devoted, in sum, more attention to it than to Otherwise than\nBeing, although the latter work was in part a response to\nDerrida\u2019s criticisms in \u201cViolence and Metaphysics\u201d\n(Derrida 1964 [1978]). There is little question that the novelty of\nOtherwise than Being lies in its three innovations: (1) the\nanalyses and tropes for transcendence-in-immanence (recurrence,\nproximity, obsession, persecution, and substitution); (2) the\ndeconstruction of language understood as the site in which existence\nis said and explained, and (3) Levinas\u2019 \u201cwager\u201d of\nstepping out of philosophical reasoning into a performative register\nthat both \u201csays\u201d and \u201cunsays\u201d itself by turns\n(OBBE: 167).\n\nDespite these innovations, Levinas\u2019 philosophical project\nremains largely constant: to rethink the meaning of existence in\nterms of the ethical transcendence of the other. To that end, he\nconsistently revisited Husserl\u2019s phenomenological method. He\nreconceived Heidegger\u2019s ontological difference as an irreducible\nseparation between being and the good we enact. He had extensive,\noften undeclared recourse to the profound, anti-totalizing intuitions\nof religious life found in Franz Rosenzweig\u2019s new thinking. By\nreason of his opposition to systems-thought, Levinas never adhered\nuncritically to any one philosophy. \n\nA common thread runs through his philosophy and his Talmudic readings.\nTranscendence is one of his words for the spontaneity of\nresponsibility for another person. Responsibility is experienced in\nconcrete life and is variously expressed, from words like \u201chere\nI am\u201d to apologies and self-accounting. This is the case,\nLevinas argues, even before a de facto command is heard or\nreflected on. This surprising proposition hearkens to the debated\nmeaning of Jews \u201creceiving the Torah before knowing what was\nwritten in it\u201d (NTR: 42\u201343). Levinas names this\nresponsiveness Platonically the \u201cGood beyond being\u201d. We\nperform that good, that trace of the infinite, because\ninstances of answering to or for another are everyday events, though\nthey may not appear typical of natural or self-interested behaviors.\nAbove all, we do not choose to be responsible. Responsibility\narises as if elicited, before we begin to think about it, by the\napproach of the other person. Because this theme is found in his\nphilosophy as well as in his interpretations of Talmudic passages,\nLevinas\u2019 thought has, at times, left both Talmud scholars and\nphilosophers dissatisfied. For some Talmudists, his thought seems\nsecularly humanistic, with \u201cinfinity\u201d suggesting a\nclandestine concept of divinity. No stranger to Mishna and Gemara\n(Talmud), his interpretations are less preoccupied with traditional\ninter- and intra-textuality, than with the ethical content of\nthe teachings therein. To philosophers skeptical of him,\nLevinas\u2019 thought reinterprets Heidegger\u2019s hermeneutic\ncircle of facticity in a metaphysical vein. Indeed, its\nanti-foundationalist approach to responsibility, as the pre-reflective\nstructure of the embodied, intersubjective \u201cself\u201d\n(soi), appears to these critics to lie between phenomenology\nand religious thought, even if it lacks specific dogmatic commitments.\nAs we have seen, in his later philosophy, the seemingly metaphysical\nconcept of illeity expresses my emotive experience of a\n\u201cpower\u201d or an affective excess greater than I can contain.\nIn this way, it also resembles Descartes\u2019 \u201clight so\nresplendent\u201d (Descartes 1641 [1911], Meditation V). But\nit is precisely in these tensions, between the Jewish religious and\nphilosophical traditions, on the one hand, and his\nphenomenological-existential thinking-of-the-other, on the other hand,\nthat Levinas\u2019 originality lies.\n",
