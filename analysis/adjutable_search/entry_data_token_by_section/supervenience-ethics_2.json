    "main_text": "Theorizing Ethical Supervenience || The structure of ethical supervenience\n1.2 The structure of ethical supervenience\n\nThere are many possible structures of covariation that have been\ncalled supervenience theses in the metaphysics literature. For our\npurposes, it will be convenient to distinguish four of the most\ninfluential formulations. (The literature on supervenience contains\nseveral other variations; see the entry on\n supervenience\n for an excellent introduction, from which this entry adopts some of\nthe formulations below. That entry also has very helpful discussion of\nthe contrast between supervenience and certain other metaphysical\nrelations with which it is often associated. The contrast between\nsupervenience and the closely-related notion of entailment, discussed\nin section 3.2 of the entry on\n supervenience,\n is especially germane to the topic of this subsection.)\n\nOne important structural distinction concerns whether a thesis makes\nclaims about the properties of individuals (individual\nsupervenience theses), or is cast in terms of the character of whole\npossible worlds (global supervenience theses). The ethical\nproperties globally supervene on the base properties just in\ncase:\n\nGlobal\n\nEvery pair of possible worlds that has exactly the same world-wide\npattern of distribution of base properties, also has exactly the same\nworld-wide pattern of distribution of ethical properties (cf. the\nentry on\n supervenience).\n \n\nIndividual supervenience theses are so-called because they explicitly\nstate patterns of instantiation of properties by individuals\n(rather than across whole possible worlds). There are two prominent\nsorts of individual supervenience theses in the literature. The\nethical properties weakly supervene on the base properties\njust in case:\n\nWeak\n\nNecessarily, if anything x has some ethical property\nF, then there is at least one base property G such\nthat x has G, and everything that has G has\nF (cf. the entry on\n supervenience).\n \n\nThe ethical properties strongly supervene on the base\nproperties just in case:\n\nStrong\n\nNecessarily, if anything x has some ethical property\nF, then there is at least one base property G such\nx has G, and necessarily everything\nthat has G has F (cf. the entry on\n supervenience).\n \n\nThe crucial difference between Strong and Weak supervenience is the\nsecond necessity operator in Strong. An example will make the\ndifference here vivid: weak ethical supervenience is compatible with\nit being a brute fact that there are both \u201cutilitarian\u201d\npossible worlds where rightness covaries uniformly with happiness\nmaximization, and \u201cKantian\u201d possible worlds, where\nrightness covaries uniformly with satisfying the categorical\nimperative. By contrast, strong supervenience denies this\npossibility.\n\nIt is generally agreed that strong supervenience entails global\nsupervenience and weak supervenience; there is considerable\ncontroversy about whether global supervenience entails strong\nsupervenience (see \u00a74.3 of the entry on\n supervenience).\n\nConsider another important individual ethical supervenience relation,\ninspired by Brian McLaughlin (1995, 24) but stated less\ntechnically:\n\nStrong Intuitive\n\nIf two possible entities are alike in all base respects, they are\nalike in all ethical respects.\n\n\nIf we interpret \u2018possible\u2019 here as representing\nmetaphysical modality, both McLaughlin and Jaegwon Kim (1993, 81) note\nthat the Strong and Strong Intuitive supervenience relations are\nequivalent. However,\n Section 2\n below will show that if we reinterpret the modalities involved, these\ntheses will no longer be equivalent.\n",
