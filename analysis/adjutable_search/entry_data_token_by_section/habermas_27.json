Constitutional Patriotism, Cosmopolitanism, and International Law\n\nHabermas\u2019s views on national identity, the nation state, and\nglobal politics have been shaped by the historical experience of\nliving through the Third Reich, the division of Germany into East and\nWest, reunification, and the development of the European Union. The\nkey to his applied political theory\n\n\nconsists in differentiating between the three elements of statehood,\ndemocratic constitution, and civic solidarity, which are closely\nlinked in the historical form of the constitutional state. (2009\nchapter 7: 112)\n\n\nHabermas argues that the conjunction of these elements is contingent,\nnot necessary, and that in the \u201cpostnational\nconstellation\u201d of the late twentieth and early twenty-first\ncenturies they should be disaggregated. His theory of constitutional\npatriotism argues that civic solidarity need not be reduced to\nnational identity, but can rather be generated by the process of\nconstitution-making itself\n (\u00a76.1).\n With regard to the international arena, he argues that the\nconstitutionalization of international law can proceed without a\nglobal state, and, as such, cosmopolitans should aim at a\n\u201cpolitically-constituted world society\u201d (2004 chapter 8\n[2006c: 161]) rather than a world republic\n (\u00a76.2).\n",
