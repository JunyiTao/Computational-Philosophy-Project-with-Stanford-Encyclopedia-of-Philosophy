    "main_text": "Utopianism || Utopian Socialism\n8.1 Utopian Socialism\n\nIt is well-known that Marx never provided a detailed account of the\nbasic structure of the future communist society that he predicted.\nThis was not simply an omission on his part, but rather reflects his\ndeliberate commitment, as he colloquially has it, to refrain from\nwriting \u201crecipes\u201d for the \u201crestaurants\u201d of the\nfuture (MECW 35: 17, translation amended).\n\nThe reasoning that underpins this commitment can be reconstructed from\nMarx\u2019s engagement with the radical political tradition that he\ncalled \u201cutopian socialism\u201d, and whose founding triumvirate\nwere Charles Fourier (1772\u20131837), Henri Saint-Simon\n(1760\u20131825), and Robert Owen (1771\u20131858). Note that the\ndistinction between Marxian socialism and utopian socialism is not an\nexhaustive one. Marx happily allows that there are socialists who are\nneither Marxian nor Utopian; for example, the \u201cfeudal\nsocialists\u201d discussed in the Communist Manifesto.\n\nWhat distinguishes utopian from other socialists is, in large part,\ntheir view that providing persuasive constructive plans and\nblueprints of future socialist arrangements is a legitimate and\nnecessary activity. (The expression \u201cplans and blueprints\u201d\nis used here to capture the necessary detail of these\ndescriptions, and not to suggest that these designs have to be thought\nof as \u201cstipulative\u201d, as having to be followed to the\nletter.) On the utopian account, the socialist future needs to be\ndesigned before it can be delivered; the plans and blueprints being\nintended to guide and motivate socialists in their transformative\nambitions. Of course, that Marx is not in this sense utopian\ndoes not rule out the possibility of additional (here unspecified)\nsenses in which he might accurately be so described.\n\nMarx\u2019s account of utopian socialism might appear contradictory.\nIt is certainly easy to find not only passages fiercely criticising\nutopian authors and texts, but also passages generously praising them.\nHowever, that criticism and that praise turn out to attach to slightly\ndifferent targets, revealing an underlying and consistent structure to\nhis account.\n\nThat underlying structure rests on two main distinctions. The first\ndistinction is a chronological one running between the\nfounding triumvirate, on the one hand, and second and subsequent\ngenerations of utopian socialists, on the other. (These later\ngenerations including both loyal followers of the founding\ntriumvirate, and independent later figures such as \u00c9tienne\nCabet (1788\u20131856)). The second distinction is a\nsubstantive one running between the critical part of utopian\nwritings (the portrayal of faults within contemporary capitalist\nsociety), on the one hand, and the constructive part of utopian\nwritings (the detailed description of the ideal socialist future), on\nthe other.\n\nNote that these distinctions underpin the asymmetry of Marx\u2019s\nassessment of utopian socialism. Simply put: he is more enthusiastic\nand positive about the achievements of the first generation of\nutopians, by comparison with those of second and subsequent\ngenerations; and he is more enthusiastic and positive about the\nutopians\u2019 criticism of contemporary society, by comparison with\nthe utopians\u2019 constructive endeavours.\n",
