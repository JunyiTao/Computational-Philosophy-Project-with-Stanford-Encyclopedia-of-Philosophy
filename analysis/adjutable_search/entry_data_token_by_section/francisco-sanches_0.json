    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work \n\nFrancisco Sanches/S\u00e1nchez (1551\u20131623) was a physician and\na philosopher. As professor of both medicine and philosophy at the\nUniversity of Toulouse, he was the author of a number of treatises on\nboth medicine and philosophy, but gained notoriety as the sceptical\nphilosopher who penned Quod Nihil Scitur (1581), or That\nNothing is Known (1988, TNK). As a philosopher who took a\nsceptical view of knowledge, and who famously ended his writings with\nthe Latin interrogative \u201cquid?\u201d even the question\nof whether he was Portuguese or Spanish by birth, has been the subject\nof much debate. This has led to the confusing dual spelling of his\nlast name: with an \u201cs\u201d by Luso-Brazilian scholars\n(Sanches); with a \u201cz\u201d by Spanish scholars\n(S\u00e1nchez); and commonly with an \u201cs\u201d (with some\nexceptions) by English-language scholars. Here the latter spelling\nwill be used solely in keeping with English language scholarship and\ntranslations, while referring to Sanches, as an Iberian philosopher.\nThis confusion over his rightful birth place, is curiously reflected\nin Elaine Limbrick\u2019s Introduction to That Nothing is\nKnown, where she refers to him as \u201cthe Portuguese\nphilosopher and doctor\u201d on page 1 and then a few pages later\nwrites that \u201cFrancisco Sanches (Franciscus Sanchez) was probably\nborn on July 16, 1551, in Tuy, a city of northwestern\nSpain\u2026\u201d (Limbrick 1988: 4): situated across the border\nfrom the Portuguese city of Braga, with which it shared an archdiocese\n(Cazac 1903, 1904). Supposedly, a distant cousin of Michel de\nMontaigne, and born to a family of \u201cconversos\u201d (Orden\nJim\u00e9nez 2012, in Other Internet Resources), in 1562 the Sanches\nfamily moved to the Bordeaux region where the cultural and political\nclimate was much more amicable towards Jews and converts (Limbrick\n1988: 5). It was in Bordeaux that Sanches attended the prestigious\nColl\u00e8ge de Guyenne between the years 1562 and 1571. The\nColl\u00e8ge de Guyenne, whose course of study ranged from secondary\nschool to college, included a curriculum that emphasized the rhetoric\nof Aristotle and the scholastics. \n\n\nThe existence of higher groups in philosophy and of public lectures in\nGreek and mathematics indicates the overlapping of school and\nuniversity, (Woodward 1906: 143) \n\n\nwhich gives one some idea as to the kind of education Sanches received\nat the Coll\u00e8ge. And in effect, the first two years of college\nlevel courses included the study of Aristotelian logic and natural\nphilosophy (based on the Physica and on De\nCaelo).\n\nMoreover, the teaching of Aristotle, as Michel Reulos has pointed out,\nfocused on manuals and commentaries on \u201cthe Philosopher\u201d\nrather than on the actual works of Aristotle (Reulos 1976: 149); and\nthat in turn, had mostly to do with the fact that relatively little of\nAristotle (and much less of Plato) had been translated into Latin. The\ntranslated excerpts were put at the service of the study of theology\n(1976: 152), and the way in which Aristotle was taught, says Reulos,\ndid not change until the early 1600s, when due to the influence of\n Petrus Ramus (1515\u20131572),\n the study of Aristotle in the colleges began to emphasize a return to\nthe texts themselves, and deemphasize the medieval commentaries (1976:\n154). This explains two major factors regarding Sanches\u2019 early\nacademic background in light of his work: On the one hand, the\nfluidity of his Latin and on the other, Sanches\u2019 own\nacknowledgment that the target of the attack in That Nothing is\nKnown was not so much Aristotle, but rather the scholastic use of\nAristotle. In contrast to the style of Scholastic logicians,\nSanches\u2019 style is direct, informal, and devoid of rhetorical\nflourishes. And yet while Sanches approvingly cites the Spanish\nhumanist, Juan Luis Vives\u2019 (1492\u20131540) criticism of the\nnon-sense produced by the Scholastic dialecticians who only knew\nAristotle \u201cthrough Latin translations and commentaries\u201d,\nargues Limbrick (TNK: 29), Petrus Ramus, on the other hand, fails to\nget mentioned, due to the latter\u2019s wish to fuse rhetoric with\ndialectic and more significantly, reconfigure the Galenic method so as\nto \u201cascend\u201d from particulars to universals (Ong 1958\n[1983: 257\u2013258]). For it\u2019s a noteworthy fact that in 1571\nSanches went to study medicine at La Sapienza in Rome: where\n Galen\n was one of the key figures of medical studies. And to a great extent\none could argue that Sanches\u2019 empiricist scepticism can best be\nunderstood against the background of Galen\u2019s inductive method\nand his own training as a physician. Medical pedagogy at La Sapienza\nunderscored the importance of observation while giving much less\nweight to logic and dialectic; in other words, it centered its\nteachings on Galen\u2019s method as exemplified in the Ars\nmedica, and underplayed the Aristotelian logic and natural\nphilosophy of the scholastics; a factor that doubtlessly, impacted on\nSanches\u2019 philosophy. Sanches, however, did not graduate from La\nSapienza. Instead, two years later, in 1573, he returned to the south\nof France, to conclude his studies at the more pedagogically\nconservative University of Montpellier, which like La Sapienza\nconcentrated primarily on Galenic theory (and secondarily on\nHippocrates) (Limbrick 1988: 63). And on 13 July 1574 he received his\ndoctorate from the University of Montpellier, where he unsuccessfully\ntried to secure a position as chair in the Medical Department.\nDisappointed with internal and external (religious) politics, Sanches\ngained employment at the University of Toulouse (1575) where he\nremained until his death in 1623, as professor of both medicine and\nphilosophy.\n",
