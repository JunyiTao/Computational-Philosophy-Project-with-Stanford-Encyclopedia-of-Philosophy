    "main_text": "Moral Reality and Moral Realism || Moral reality as Platonic good\n5.2 Moral reality as Platonic good\n\nA second, and increasingly prominent, strand in Murdoch\u2019s view\nof moral reality is that it is \u201cThe Good\u201d, understood in a\nPlatonic sense. One element in Murdoch\u2019s Platonism is that\nsomething like the form of the Good constitutes what is known when we\nhave moral knowledge, and is also what is sought and loved. We achieve\nthat understanding through knowing and loving the good in good\nparticular things (including persons but also art, nature and ideas),\nthen ascending to an understanding of Good itself. (Murdoch frequently\nemploys Plato\u2019s \u201cascending\u201d metaphor [e.g., SGC:\n94/377].) Murdoch also says, attributing it to Plato, that the Good is\nlike a light that enables us to see goodness in particular things\n(SGC: 93/376).\n\nMurdoch explicitly rejects two philosophically familiar ways to\nunderstand \u201cgood\u201d\u2014a functional use (\u201cgood\nknife\u201d; SGC: 93/376) and good as \u201cthe most general\nadjective of commendation\u201d (SGC: 98/381). These do not give us a\nclue to the concept. \u201cA genuine mysteriousness attaches to the\nidea of goodness and the Good\u201d (SGC: 99/381).\n\nWhile the Good is an object of both knowledge and love for Murdoch\n(and she links those two notions (\u201cto love, that is, to\nsee\u201d [OGG: 66/354]; \u201cattention to reality inspired by,\nconsisting of, love\u201d [OGG: 67/354]), she does not subscribe to\nthe aspect of Plato\u2019s view that regards the forms as more real\nthan individual objects and persons who partake of them in the world\nof experience, nor as inhabiting a transcendent world beyond our world\nof experience (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2019: 267). And she rejects this as a\nproper interpretation of Plato (SGC: 96/378f; Robjant provides a\ndetailed defense of her interpretation of Plato [Robjant 2012].)).\n The Good and other persons are distinct strands in Murdoch\u2019s\nview of moral reality. But they reinforce each other. Hopwood\ninterprets Murdoch as saying that \u201cwe love particular\nindividuals in light of the Good, and we love the Good through\nparticular individuals\u201d (Hopwood 2018: 486). Murdoch\u2019s\nview is not analogous to Kant\u2019s idea that respecting the other\nperson involves directing that respect to the moral law or rational\nwill within them, or to their best self. (Velleman defends a form of\nKant\u2019s view as Murdochian, understanding rational will to be the\ncapacity for valuing [Velleman 1999 (2006: 100)]. Hopwood criticizes\nthis view [Hopwood 2018: 482].) For Murdoch loving and knowing other\npersons is also not the same as knowing what is distinctly good in\nthem or about them.  Susan Wolf rejects the idea that loving attention\nas Murdoch (and she) understand it affirms the moral goodness, or\noverall goodness, of its object. One can love, and direct loving\nattention to, another whose deficiencies and faults she fully\nrecognizes (Wolf 2014). Both Cordner and Wolf emphasize that it is the\nperson as a whole that is the proper object of loving attention\n(Cordner 2016; Wolf 2014). Murdoch agrees, in giving a criticism of\nKant: \u201cKant does not tell us to respect whole particular\ntangled-up historical individuals\u201d (M&E 1957/EM: 215).\n\nOther connections between the Platonic and the other persons strands,\nnot necessarily incompatible with the ones mentioned, have been\nproposed. Clarke suggests that the Good is a perfectionist principle\nin Murdoch, so that seeing other persons in light of the Good is just\nan expression of her perfectionism, pushing the agent to achieve a\nmore and more just, loving, and complete perception of that person\n(Clarke 2012). Dorothy Emmet, an older contemporary and friend of\nMurdoch presses a similar view, that the Good should be thought of as\na \u201cregulative ideal\u201d in the Kantian sense, \u201can\nindefinable standard towards which we can turn in appreciation\nof\u201d what is Good (or Beautiful). But Emmet differs from Clarke\nin denying that this is a moral principle (Emmet 1994 [this book was\ndedicated to Murdoch]: 65\u201366; see also 1979 for one of the first\nscholarly engagements with Murdoch). Emmet likely also influenced\nMurdoch\u2019s resistance to British philosophy\u2019s jettisoning\nof metaphysics in its analytic and linguistic modalities in the 1950s,\nthrough Emmet\u2019s defense of metaphysics in her 1945 The\nNature of Metaphysical Thinking; which Murdoch read, and in her\nand Murdoch\u2019s attempts starting in the 1950s (and in all of\nMurdoch\u2019s subsequent writings) to bring religion and philosophy\ncloser together. Murdoch acknowledges that the Christian conception of\nGod influences her understanding of the Good. \u201cI shall suggest\nthat God was (or is) a single perfect transcendent non-representable\nand necessarily real object of attention\u201d and that we should\nretain a non-theistic concept [i.e., Good] with those characteristics\n(OGG: 55/344). This semi-religious dimension relates to the idea\nMurdoch occasionally expresses, and more so in Metaphysics,\nthat the Good is a source of energy that is not found within our\n\u201cnatural psychology\u201d (OGG: 71/358).\n",
